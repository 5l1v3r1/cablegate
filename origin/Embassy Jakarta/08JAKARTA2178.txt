¶1. (U) Summary: Top Indonesian rock band Slank and the Indonesian 
Corruption Eradication Commission chairman partnered with Embassy 
Jakarta on November 25 to promote youth participation in the 
political process, particularly combating corruption.  Ambassador 
Hume hosted nearly 500 guests - largely university students and 
civil society leaders - at his residence for a "Welcome Home" 
concert after Slank's recent four-week U.S. tour.  Corruption 
Eradication Commission chairman Antasari Azhar spoke to the crowd of 
university students, civil society leaders, and government 
officials, encouraging everyone to engage in the fight against 
corruption.  The hour-long Slank concert was broadcast live on 
Indonesian radio and filmed for television broadcast, reaching over 
two million people through the 20 national media outlets covering 
the show.  End Summary. 
 
Ambassador, KPK, and Slank partner to combat corruption 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶2. (U) Indonesian rock band Slank, the Rolling Stones of Indonesia, 
toured the U.S. in October and November to promote its 
newly-released album, wrapping up a 15-performance tour in Hollywood 
on November 20.  Ambassador Hume invited Slank to perform at his 
residence for a "Welcome Home" concert on November 25 to highlight 
cultural links through music between Indonesia and the U.S.  Beyond 
its star appeal in youth culture, Slank has promoted messages of 
youth participation in the political process, particularly combating 
corruption and environmental awareness.  Slank performed on the 
steps of the Corruption Eradication Commission earlier this year, 
playing their hit song "Street Gossip," which lampoons the corrupt 
of all stripes.  Members of Parliament filed a defamation case 
against the band for this song, but the case was quickly dropped 
after the arrest of several Members of Parliament on corruption 
charges. 
 
¶3. (U) Corruption Eradication Commission Chairman Antasari Azhar 
addressed the crowd before the Slank performance.  Azhar outlined 
goals for the Corruption Eradication Commission, highlighting 
messages of both prosecution and prevention.  The KPK's popularity 
and credibility have strengthened under Azhar's leadership over the 
past year largely due to high-level prosecutions.  At the concert, 
Azhar pressed the prevention message, encouraging the young leaders 
in attendance to combat corruption in all forms and in all places. 
 
 
Reaching youth and young leaders through music 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4. (U) The Embassy invited hundreds of youth and young leaders, 
drawn from university groups, civil society, and young leaders in 
government.  The university groups - over half of the audience - 
included Muslim and Christian, private and public, elite and 
mainstream higher-education institutions.  Civil society leaders 
included anti-corruption reform, legal reform, and environmental 
organizations.  Several civil society members remarked that the 
event was a unique opportunity for groups from a variety of 
backgrounds to meet, dialogue, and unite around a common theme. 
 
¶5. (U) Within the government, the Embassy invited young leaders from 
the Corruption Eradication Commission and the Attorney General's 
Anti-Corruption Task Force.  In addition, the Embassy invited 
several Muslim youth organizations as well as business leaders.  The 
Ambassador also invited the prominent Indonesian business leader 
Peter Gontha, who supported Slank's U.S. tour and is working with 
Embassy Jakarta to advance the Jakarta-Los Angeles sister city 
relationship. 
 
Slank's anti-corruption message reaches millions 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶6. (U) The Embassy worked with Indonesian media outlets GlobalTV and 
GlobalFM to broadcast the concert live over the radio and to film 
the concert.  GlobalTV will re-broadcast the Slank "Welcome Home" 
concert during primetime on November 30, which will reach millions 
of viewers.  In addition, over 20 national print, radio, and 
television media outlets covered the event, further adding to the

event's audience. 
 
Slank, cultural diplomacy, and the U.S. image 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) The actual Slank concert and resulting media coverage 
provided an opportunity for Embassy Jakarta to engage youth and 
other audiences that are typically difficult for Embassies to 
engage.  It also allowed us to promote - and be associated with - an 
anti-corruption message that resonates with Indonesians, especially 
youth.  Leading Indonesian language daily Kompas featured a 
front-page article and photo on November 27, titled "Slank and 
Cultural Diplomacy," which highlighted the concert's messages of 
youth-oriented cultural diplomacy and combating corruption.  The 
sub-text of the concert and Kompas article were equally powerful: a 
popular Indonesian band promoting U.S.-Indonesian partnership and a 
positive, welcoming image of the United States.
