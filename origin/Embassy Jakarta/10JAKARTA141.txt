¶2.  (U) While some pundits see new "mass organization" 
National Democrat (ND) as a challenge to President Yudhoyono, 
his Partai Demokrat members (PD) are saying its establishment 
is good for Indonesia's democracy.  Media magnate and Golkar 
member Surya Paloh launched the political group February 1. 
Leaders of the group included Jogjakarta Governor Sultan 
Hamengkubuwono X, rector of Paramadina University Anies 
Baswedan, and former chair of Muhammadiyah Syafii Maarif. 
Approximately 12,000 people (many of whom were paid) attended 
the launch, including prominent political, academic and 
religious leaders such as Partai Demokrat's Deputy Chair, 
Ahmad Mubarok.  The group's stated purpose was to establish a 
"mature" democracy that is focused on improving the people's 
welfare. 
 
CHALLENGE TO SBY OR SIGN OF A FLOURISHING DEMOCRACY? 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Some commentators see ND as a sign that the 
Indonesian elite are dissatisfied with Yudhoyono's reform 
record to date.  ND takes a page from President Yudhoyono's 
play book by imitating the colors, theme song and rhetoric of 
his successful Partai Demokrat.  PD members do not see the 
new group as criticism, however-- its Deputy Chair remarked 
that ND has "a similar vision for the nation" and that 
competition is good for its democracy. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Although ND is apolitical, many pundits are 
speculating that Paloh (defeated in his October bid for 
Golkar chair) is testing the waters for a 2014 presidential 
election run.  Parliamentarian and PD member Ramadan Pohan 
told Poloff that the new movement is a good thing for 
Indonesia, and that even if the movement turns into a 
political party down the road, it will not challenge PD: 
"This group is too focused on the elite.  To win the 
elections you have to win the hearts of the people in the 
villages, not Jakarta."  PD, he said, is focused now on its 
upcoming leadership contest in May, which will determine the 
future of the party.
