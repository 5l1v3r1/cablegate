¶1.  (U) Summary:  PT. Duta Bangun Persada (Bangun) confirmed on July 
23 that the company is a registered supplier of the Indonesian Air 
Force (IAF) and received orders from IAF to procure components 
detailed in reftel.  The company completed its shipment and sent the 
ordered goods listed in license 05-1010408 and 05-1014219 directly 
to the IAF through their principle in Singapore.  However, Bangun is 
still in the process of completing delivery of the remaining license 
¶050032097.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  We contacted Duta Bangun Persada on July 23 to confirm shipment 
of goods listed in reftel.  Bangun's procurement officer Nancy 
Hutagaol confirmed that the company received orders from Indonesian 
Air Force (IAF) to procure spare parts for IAF's C-130 aircraft and 
placed its orders to three different U.S. sellers mentioned in 
reftel.  Ms. Hutagaol said that those orders were shipped by air 
from U.S. Sellers through Bangun's principals in Singapore 
(UNISERVE-trading).  Uniserve then delivered the ordered components 
to the IAF appointed freight forwarder who delivered the order 
directly to IAF's warehouse at Halim Air Force Base in South 
Jakarta.  The goods did not pass through Bangun's warehouse.  Ms. 
Hutagaol also claimed that licenses DTC Case: 05-1010408 and 
05-1014219 are completed and already received by the IAF.  However, 
one shipment of voltage regulators, DTC Case: 050032097, is still at 
UNISERVE-trading , which is located in 14A Poole Road (Tanjung 
Katong), Singapore, waiting for further delivery to the IAF.  Air 
Way Bill for this shipment from U.S. seller L.J. Walch Co., Inc to 
UNISERVE is DHL-90220804531. 
 
¶3.  We also contacted IAF Chief of Procurement Air First Marshal 
(AFM) Sunaryo on July 24 to confirm the transaction.  AFM Sunaryo 
confirmed that he is familiar with Bangun, noting that the company 
is indeed a registered IAF supplier.  Sunaryo also confirmed that 
his office received the manifold assy and indicator/anti skid box 
detailed in license number 05-1010408 and 05-1014219 in reftel.  The 
goods were received in full quantity in April 2007, and his office 
is awaiting the other three pieces of the voltage regulator.  AFM 
Sunaryo explained that all IAF procurement orders are received at 
the Halim AFB Center of Material Supply (warehouse).  They are then 
distributed to IAF facilities requiring the goods.
