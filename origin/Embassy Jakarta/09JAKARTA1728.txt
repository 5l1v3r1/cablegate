REF: JAKARTA 00988 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Irregular migrants from Sri Lanka are 
swelling the number of potential refugees seeking to transit 
Indonesia on their way to Australia. On October 12 an 
Indonesian warship intercepted a cargo ship that was carrying 
253 Sri Lankan refugees in the Sunda Strait between West Java 
and Southern Sumatra.  The Indonesian navy was reportedly 
tipped off by Australian Prime Minister Rudd, who called 
President Yudhyono over the weekend.  The migrants are 
refusing to get off the ship for fear that they will be 
detained while the UNHCR investigates.  As reported reftel, 
Indonesian immigration officials work closely with the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) and UNHCR and 
irregular migrants are generally treated well while in 
Indonesia.  END SUMMARY 
 
NUMBER OF IRREGULAR MIGRANTS CONTINUES TO GROW 
 
¶2. (SBU) As reported reftel, the number of irregular migrants 
transiting Indonesia on their way to Australia this year is 
on pace to quadruple over last year, primarily due to a surge 
from Afghanistan and other areas of conflict in South Asia. 
Beginning in May 2009, migrants from Sri Lanka are also 
adding to these numbers. (Note: 55 Sri Lankan men landed in 
Aceh in May.)  Prime Minister Rudd called President Yudhoyono 
over the weekend to let him know that undocumented intending 
immigrants were heading for the Sunda Strait, between West 
Java and Southern Sumatra. An Indonesian warship intercepted 
the cargo ship and led it to port in Banten, West Java.  The 
Australians and Indonesians last met in July to discuss ways 
to stop the flow of irregular migrants. 
 
SRI LANKANS FEARFUL OF BEING CAUGHT IN UNHCR PROCESS 
 
¶3. (SBU) Although the press has reported that the irregular 
migrants would be kept in Banten and then transferred to an 
immigration detention center, Post's contact stated that only 
eight of the 253 refugees had disembarked. All eight, 
including one pregnant woman, were taken to a local hospital 
while the others hunkered down on the boat.  Fueling the 
refugees' fears of being caught in limbo were reports that if 
they landed in Indonesia they would be turned over to the 
UNHCR for processing.  In June 2009 the UNHCR began to 
process the above-mentioned 55 Sri Lankan refugees, many of 
whom are still waiting to be settled. 
 
INDONESIAN IMMIGRATION WORKS TO FOLLOW THE RULES 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Immigration officials told us that they hoped to 
resolve this situation as quickly as possible.  The IOM has 
been notified and is on standby to assist when the refugees 
disembark.  The GOI will wait until the irregular immigrants 
are on Indonesian soil before requesting UNHCR assistance.
