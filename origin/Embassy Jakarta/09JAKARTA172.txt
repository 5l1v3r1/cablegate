¶1. (U) SUMMARY. DCM hosted a third parliamentary outreach 
working lunch in advance of a January 26-29 legislative 
reform visit to Washington.  The working lunch series was 
established in response to the Indonesian Parliament's 
request for expanded cooperation on parliamentary 
capacity-building.  It is particularly important that we 
support these reform efforts as Indonesia approaches its 
April 9 legislative elections.  These peer-to-peer exchanges 
are key in strengthening the Parliament's operational 
effectiveness, and provide a crucial building block for a 
strategic partnership. END SUMMARY. 
 
DPR'S REFORM EFFORT 
 
¶2. (U) DCM hosted a third working lunch January 22 to discuss 
parliamentary reforms with Members of Parliament (MPs) and 
staffers.  The working lunch series was established in 
response to the Indonesian Parliament's (DPR) request for 
expanded Government of Indonesia (GOI)-USG cooperation on 
parliamentary capacity building (reftel). 
 
¶3. (U) Parliamentarians and staff attending the lunch were 
U.S.-Indo Caucus members and participants in GOI-funded 
research and training trips to the U.S.  The U.S. House 
Democracy Assistance Commission (HDAC), USAID, State, and 
Library of Congress (LOC) facilitate these substantive 
missions.  A delegation of nine MPs and two staff working on 
an important legislative reform bill are in the U.S. January 
26-29 to learn more about the function and structure of the 
U.S. legislature. 
 
A NEW AND IMPROVED USG-GOI RELATIONSHIP 
 
¶4. (U) Participants at the lunch discussed the forthcoming 
U.S. and Indonesian economic stimulus packages.  Some 
expressed economic nationalist sentiments, but all shared a 
desire to move our relationship forward.  The DCM said that 
Indonesia should open itself up to foreign competition, 
particularly by sending students of its own abroad and 
enabling them to compete on the global stage. 
 
¶5. (U) The MPs expressed the hope that President Obama's 
"respectful" approach to the Muslim world will strengthen our 
bilateral relationship.  They were also pleased that 
Secretary Clinton recognized Indonesia as a multi-ethnic 
democracy with global importance. 
 
ON HOW TO COOPERATE 
 
¶6. (U) DCM asked about areas of possible cooperation.  The 
MPs expressed the need for good governance, infrastructure 
and social reforms.  Their specific priorities included: 
 
--Strengthening the regional parliament; 
--Improving communication between local and national levels 
of government; 
--And improving the delivery of regional public services. 
 
¶7.  USAID noted that the USG cooperates with the GOI on 
governance capacity building and anticipates continued 
interaction with the GOI to identify its current priorities 
for strategic partnership.  DCM urged the MPs to approach us 
with any new ideas. 
 
¶8. (U) Talk also centered on the greatly anticipated 
possibility that President Obama will come to Indonesia.  If 
he does, they would like to hear him talk about poverty 
alleviation, education, and the economy.  They also asked for 
more dialogue and more visits from both sides.  On improving 
the relationship through education initiatives, one Member 
waxed nostalgic about USIS American centers and the books he 
used to read there.  LOC and USAID representatives reminded 
him of USG's ongoing programs of support to the DPR and 
Indonesia.  Senior MP Marzuki Darusman praised the recently 
established Global Legal Information Center (GLIN Center) as 
an access point for the DPR to the Library of Congress 
(reftel).  The other MPs responded that they need to make 
these initiatives better known to the DPR as a whole. 
 
PROMOTING DEMOCRACY THROUGH PEER-TO-PEER EXCHANGES 
 
JAKARTA 00000172  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶9. (U) As the April 9 legislative elections draw nearer, it 
is particularly important that we support these reform 
efforts as a fruitful area of cooperation.  These 
peer-to-peer exchanges are instrumental in helping the DPR 
develop effective legislation, oversight, and transparency. 
They are also vital to U.S. interests in effectively 
promoting democratic institutions long term.
