REF: STATE 35404 (EXTENSION OF OCCUPIED TERRITORIES 
     MANDATE) 
 
 Â¶1. (U) On March 21, met with Heru Santoso and Dicky Yunus of 
the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs' Human Rights 
Directorate to urge that the Human Rights Council not take up 
the question of the Special Rapporteur on the Occupied 
Palestinian Territories outside the context of the Mandate 
Review Working Group.  Drawing on reftel, we argued that such 
a step would undermine the objectivity and non-selectivity of 
the Human Rights Council and create a double standard. 
Santoso and Yunus took our points on board, but stated 
frankly that Indonesia would not break with any OIC consensus 
on this issue.
