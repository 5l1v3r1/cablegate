REF: SECSTATE 195469 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary: On January 9th PT Azka Megah Dirgantara 
(Dirgantara) verified its August 2006 order of thirty Anti Gravity 
Suits from the U.S. firm Life Support International Inc., under 
application number 05-101332.  The Indonesian Air Force (IAF) also 
confirmed its order of the Anti Gravity Suits through Dirgantara as 
detailed in reftel. End summary. 
 
¶2.  We contacted PT Azka Megah Dirgantara Director Yose Rizal on 
January 9th and he referred us to Commissioner Budi Prasatya 
Anandakhrisna, who is in charge of all contracting and procurement 
matters for Dirgantara.  Anandakhrisna confirmed Dirgantara's order 
of thirty Anti Gravity Suits (Anti G Suits), as detailed in reftel, 
from the U.S. firm Life Support International Inc. in August 2006. 
According to Anandakhrisna, for ease of delivery and lower costs the 
company will route the order through its shipping affiliate, 
Sindomas Corporation, located in Singapore. Once Dirgantara receives 
the goods from the U.S. seller, they will deliver the Anti G Suits 
from their Jakarta warehouse to the Indonesian Air Force. 
Anandakhrisna also stated that Dirgantara is aware of restrictions 
on [USML articles], including those pertaining to re-export. 
 
¶3.  Anandakhrisna told us that, PT. Azka Megah Dirgantara's primary 
business has been providing building construction and renovation 
services for IAF buildings and properties since its inception in 
¶2004.  Most projects are located in Bandung, West Java, where 
Dirgantara is headquartered. Starting in 2005, Dirgantara 
diversified into procurement for the IAF. Dirgantara's first 
procurement was in 2005 for Anti Gravity Suits for IAF pilots. 
Dirgantara subcontracted the order to a local supplier for delivery 
of non-U.S. Anti G Suits. 
 
¶4.  Per reftel we also contacted the Indonesian Air Force, office of 
Material and Supply Division, First Air Marshall Pardi Yusuf, who 
directed us to Major Nur Surachman for confirmation of application 
05-1013332. Major Surachman confirmed the IAF ordered the thirty 
Anti G suits detailed in reftel on August 16, 2006, through PT. Azka 
Megah Dirgantara.  We accordingly have no reason to doubt that the 
company is a reliable recipient of USML items.
