Â¶1. (SBU) We met December 28 with Carolina Tinangon, desk 
officer in the International Security and Disarmament 
Directorate of Indonesia's Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DEPLU), to deliver information on implementation of UNSCR 
1737 on Iran's nuclear program.  Ms. Tinangon was already 
very familiar with the resolution's provisions, and indicated 
that DEPLU has begun the interagency process needed to 
involve Customs and other relevant elements of the GOI in 
enforcing the provisions.
