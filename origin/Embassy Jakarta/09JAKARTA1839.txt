¶1.  On Noveb"er 4, newly-appointed Minister of Marine Affairs nnd 
Fisheries Fadel Muhammad highlighted marine rs"earch and human 
resource development as two key areas for increased U.S.-Indonesian 
collaboration   Speaking with Ambassador Hume, Muhammad cited thQ 
planned voyage of NOAA's Okeanos Explorer to Inoonesia, and U.S. 
support of the Coral Triangle Ii(tiative, as concrete examples of 
partnership.  He reiterated President Yudhoyono's full support for 
the ship's research voyage next June, and exprese d an interest in 
visiting the ship together with Ambassador Hume.  Muhammad was 
pleased to hear of NOAA Administrator Dr. Jane Lubchenco's planned 
visit to Indonesia.  He hoped Lubchenco's visit next January would 
further strengthen NOAA's existing partnership with his ministry. 
 
¶2.  In connection with the Okeanos Explorer, Muhammad noted that we 
know far more about terrestrial than marine biodiversity.  As a 
scuba diver, Muhammad recognized the significance of Indonesia's 
incredible marine biodiversity.  He agreed that marine research and 
work on sustainable fisheries management were of crucial importance 
to food security for tens of millions of Indonesians.  Muhammad was 
enthusiastic about a possible joint Center for Sustainable Ocean 
Fisheries (reftel), and suggested this was something which he and 
Dr. Lubchenco could "make happen" during her January visit. 
 
¶3.  This two-time Governor of Gorontalo Province assured Ambassador 
Hume that he would highlight both the Okeanos Explorer and the 
potential joint fisheries center to President Yudhoyono during a 
cabinet meeting on November 5.
