SUBJECT: INDONESIA PORT SECURITY ADVISORY DELAY 
 
REF: A) JAKARTA 2363 B) JAKARTA 3086 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Summary and Action Request: Visiting regional Coast 
Guard liaison officer informed Government of Indonesia (GOI) 
officials and representatives from U.S. companies with 
private port facilities that the Port Security Advisory (PSA) 
for Indonesia would not be issued November 24 as originally 
planned.  Government officials and U.S. companies strongly 
urged that the U.S. not issue the advisory until they had an 
opportunity to qualify to have their ports placed on the 
exempt list prior to the announcement of the PSA.  Embassy 
strongly supports their request.  Embassy would appreciate 
guidance we can share with GOI and private-sector companies 
on how Indonesian port facilities can be exempted from the 
PSA via the alternative procedures process.  End Summary and 
Action Request. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a November 19-21 visit, Singapore-based USCG 
International Port Security Liaison Officer LCDR Phil 
Purganan informed officials in the Directorate General for 
Sea Transportation (DGST) and representatives of U.S. 
companies that operate private ports that the Port Security 
Advisory for Indonesia scheduled to go into effect on or 
about November 24 had been delayed for several weeks.  DGST 
officials asked whether it was possible to use the delay to 
obtain exemptions from the eventual PSA for six key ports 
which have already been visited by the Coast Guard and found 
not to be compliant with the International Ship and Port 
Facility Code (ISPS). 
 
¶3. (SBU) DGST officials indicated that they do not object to 
using the alternative procedures process involving recognized 
security organizations (RSOs).  They expressed their strong 
belief that they should have an opportunity to address any 
security shortcomings before a PSA goes into effect.  They 
believe that the bureaucratic delay in announcing the PSA 
provides ample time to give them this opportunity. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In meetings with Chevron, British Petroleum, and 
Newmont, all of whom operate private port facilities which 
handle ships destined directly for the U.S., LCDR Purganan 
was also told that these companies would like to have their 
facilities exempted via the alternative procedures process 
prior to the PSA going into effect. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Embassy recommends that we take advantage of the 
delay in the announcement of the Port Security Advisory to 
give DGST and private companies an opportunity to qualify for 
exempt status.  This will minimize disruption in 
U.S.-Indonesian trade and will also send a strong signal to 
DGST officials that we are willing to work with them to 
address their concerns.  We would appreciate guidance we can 
share with DGST and private-sector companies on how the 
alternative procedures process works.
