SUBJECT: Indonesia Ready to Sign Forest Conservation Deal 
 
¶1.  The Government of Indonesia (GOI) is prepared to sign the 
Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA) agreements and proposes a 
signing date of June 29.  Mahendra Siregar, Deputy Minister for 
International Economic and Financial Cooperation, confirmed this at 
a GOI interagency meeting on June 10.  The Embassy and heads of 
Conservation International-Indonesia and the Indonesian Biodiversity 
Foundation (KEHATI), both of which are Parties to the TFCA 
agreements, were also invited to the meeting.  Siregar urged all 
Parties to expedite approval of the final draft agreements before 
the week of June 29.  He also asked the Minister of Forestry to 
consider hosting the signing ceremony in Jakarta on/around June 29, 
if all Parties concur. 
 
¶2.  Action request: Post urges Treasury and the USG interagency team 
to complete their review and commit to the above signing date before 
this window of opportunity closes.  Post asks for a response as soon 
as possible on whether we can commit to this date and under what 
conditions (e.g., venue and signatories).
