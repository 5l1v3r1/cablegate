1.(SBU) National Committee on Avian Influenza Management and 
Pandemic Alert (KOMNAS) Secretary Bayu Krisnamurthi described likely 
elements of an Indonesian package on sample sharing and praised USG 
contributions towards avian influenza control during an October 25 
meeting with Under Secretary Paula Dobriansky and Ambassador Cameron 
Hume.  The Under Secretary impressed upon Bayu USG avian influenza 
virus sample sharing views, stressing Washington's concerns about 
the serious risks associated with not sharing viruses.  The 
Ambassador provided Bayu with a summary of confirmed cases that show 
GOI had only shared samples from four of 30 cases since the impasse 
started.  End Summary. 
 
GOI General Objectives 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) During an October 25 meeting with Under Secretary 
Dobriansky and Ambassador Hume, Bayu noted that the Minister of 
Health has the lead on representing Indonesia's views on sample 
sharing but that both he and Coordinating Minister for People's 
Welfare Abizural Bakrie are following the discussions.  Bayu then 
described Indonesia's general objectives that would result following 
resolution of the sample sharing impasse.  These included: 
 
-- access to vaccine during a pandemic; 
-- long term development of WHO referral laboratory capacity; 
-- and long term development of Indonesian vaccine production 
capacity. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Bayu elaborated that Indonesia believes that the world 
needs to increase both vaccine production capability and the number 
of WHO AI referral laboratories.  Indonesia would like to be 
considered as an additional site for both laboratory capacity and 
vaccine production.  Indonesia realizes that it can't achieve these 
objectives on its own and would need to partner with and seek 
assistance from developed countries.  Bayu noted that the U.S. was 
the ideal partner, as the U.S. has the best research facilities, 
technology and personnel.  Bayu noted that Indonesia brings certain 
things to the partnership table: access to the virus, demonstrated 
success in its polio vaccination campaign, Biosafety Level 3 
laboratories coming on line, and openness to partnership. 
 
Praise for USG Contributions in AI 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Bayu also praised the USG for its contributions in 
controlling avian influenza, noting that the US had contributed more 
than any other country in combating the disease.  Bayu noted that 
the AI challenge is beyond vaccine and medicine.  Indonesia must 
strengthen its emergency and patient care infrastructure -- 
everything from ambulances to isolation rooms -- in order to handle 
a possible pandemic. 
 
US Position: Time to Come to the Table 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Under Secretary impressed uponBQayu USG avian influenza 
virus sample sharing views, stressing Washington's concerns about 
the seroous risks associated with not sharing samples. SheQ 
acknowledged both Indonesian concerns and WHO support actions to 
improve the current system and ep and access to all countries.  She 
described limitations in vaccine supply based on current egg-based 
technology in all countries and stressed that long term solutions 
will need to support the critical public health activities of the 
WHO and maintain the private sector incentives for development of 
vaccines by all nations. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ambassador Hume provided Bayu with a summary of confirmed 
cases that showed GOI had only shared samples from four of 30 cases 
since the impasse started.  WHO could fully characterize only one of 
these four samples.  Hume noted that senior GOI officials have told 
US counterparts that Indonesia is sharing samples, resulting in 
misleading impressions.  Hume noted that Indonesia had caught the 
world's attention by withholding samples, but is now overplaying its 
hand.  Hume stressed the need for countries to reduce the 
differences in positions during the November WHA meetings and to 
look for solutions.  Hume also reported that National Institute of 
 
JAKARTA 00003025  002 OF 002 
 
 
Health senior officials will visit Indonesia in November and could 
meet to describe general vaccine development and production issues, 
including investment in latest technologies. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Bayu expressed interest in the NIH meetings and also asked 
for follow-on meetings with the Ambassador on other issues relating 
to agriculture.  He thanked both the Under Secretary and Ambassador 
for the candid exchange of views and hoped for progress in the 
November meetings. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Comment:  This is the first meeting that Bayu acknowledged 
detailed understanding of the Indonesian sample sharing position; 
previously he has always denied much knowledge of the issue. 
Embassy believes that Bayu will immediately pass conversations from 
the Under Secretary's meeting on to Minister Bakrie and other 
officials within the GOI.  Although Minister Supari will remain the 
figurehead lead on this issue, we believe Bayu's and Bakrie's input 
will be influential in developing the Indonesian position. Continued 
engagement with Bayu and Bakrie may result in pressure on the 
Ministry of Health for faster and more reasonable resolution of 
these very complicated issues.
