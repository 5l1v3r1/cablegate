SUBJECT: G/TIP -- URGENT NEED TO REFORM INDONESIAN LABOR 
LAWS TO FURTHER PROTECT MIGRANTS 
 
¶1.  This is an Action Request -- Please see Para 6. 
 
¶2.  SUMMARY:  The Indonesian Working Group on Labor Migration 
(IWGLM) is seeking International Organization for Migration 
(IOM) assistance in reforming Indonesian Labor Law 34 on the 
Placement and Protection of Indonesian Overseas Workers.  The 
GOI realizes that it urgently needs to take steps to bolster 
its protection of migrant labor.  The project proposed below 
provides the USG with a unique opportunity to strengthen the 
GOI's protection of trafficking victims.  Mission urges 
Washington to signal support of this program to the IOM and 
we will provide details of the funding request when 
available.  END SUMMARY. 
 
REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE 
 
¶3.  (U) The GOI is newly focused on the protection of its 
migrant labor force.  (Note: IOM estimates that in 2008 more 
than 700,000 Indonesian labor migrants left Indonesia to work 
abroad.)  IOM officials told Poloff that the IWGLM is 
specifically seeking assistance in reforming Indonesian Labor 
Law number 39 on the placement and protection of Indonesian 
overseas workers.  The Working Group is made up of 
representatives from eight ministries and meets regularly. 
 
¶4.  (U) A recently completed USG project helped spark the 
Indonesian government's growing interest in protection.  This 
project, an IOM-organized, PRM-funded program on promoting 
dialogue and information sharing on labor migration between 
Indonesia and Malaysia, Singapore and the Middle East 
(Bahrain, and Kuwait), was reportedly an eye-opening 
experience for the Indonesians that participated.  Thanks in 
part to this forum, the GOI Working Group is energized to 
take concrete steps to better protect Indonesian workers 
abroad. 
 
PROTECTION FOR MIGRANT WORKERS INADEQUATE 
 
¶5.  (U) During the Working Group's study trips (August 31 - 
September 4 Singapore and Malaysia; October 3-8 Bahrain and 
Kuwait) the members saw for themselves the types of abuse 
Indonesian migrant workers are at times subjected to.  For 
instance, in Bahrain they visited a holding center where they 
allegedly saw 615 detainees being held in a facility designed 
to accommodate 100.  In Malaysia they met with Indonesian 
Embassy officials who reportedly complained bitterly about 
their inability to adequately care for migrant workers 
because of a severe lack of resources.  The Working Group was 
stunned to learn that, based on IOM's investigation, more 
than ninety percent of the Indonesian female migrant workers 
in Bahrain and Kuwait were the victims of illegal labor 
recruiters. 
 
USG FUNDING URGENTLY NEEDED 
 
6,  (U) Action Request:  IOM officials are seeking funding 
for a project to work with the GOI to overhaul labor law 34. 
They want to take advantage of the momentum and interest 
generated by the recently concluded project on labor 
migration.  The project will begin as soon as funding is 
provided and last between nine to twelve months.  Needed 
changes to the current labor law include tougher restrictions 
on "worker placement institutions" and stiffer penalties for 
illegal labor brokers.  By funding this project, the USG will 
be directly involved in strengthening the GOI's prevention 
and protection of trafficking victims.  Mission urges 
Washington to signal support for this program to IOM.  We 
will provide details on the exact funding request when it 
becomes available.
