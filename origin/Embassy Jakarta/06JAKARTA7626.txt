¶1. (SBU) Summary: The Executive Director of the National 
Committee for AI and Pandemic Control (Komnas) Bayu 
Krisnamurti told participants in a June 12 AI donor meeting 
that the GOI would host a WHO-led technical assessment of 
its AI strategy June 21-23, with participation from the 
World Bank and FAO.  The GOI will also hold a workshop to 
allow donors to present concrete funding plans in support of 
its National AI Strategy.  UNICEF is helping Komnas prepare 
a matrix of donor assistance and GOI funding to allow the 
GOI to determine funding gaps for its 2006-08 AI control 
budget.  In the past week, the number of confirmed H5N1 
cases in humans in Indonesia has remained unchanged, with 
confirmed cases holding at 51, with 39 deaths (76 percent). 
Indonesia currently ranks second in the world in both H5N1 
cases (51 confirmed) and deaths (39), and leads the world in 
case fatality rates (76 percent) for countries with more 
than ten confirmed cases.  End Summary. 
 
National AI Committee Meeting 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The Executive Director and Chair of the National 
Committee for AI and Pandemic Control (Komanas) Bayu 
Krisnamukti chaired a combined interagency and donor 
coordination AI meeting on June 12.  Bayu called the meeting 
in preparation for a scheduled session on AI at the June 14 
Consultative Group of Indonesia (CGI) meeting and an AI 
workshop or seminar for donors in early July.  (Note:  The 
GOI subsequently dropped the AI item from the CGI agenda.) 
Participants attended from the Ministry of Agriculture 
(MOA), Ministry of Health (MOH), National Development 
Planning Agency (Bappenas), Ministry of Communications 
(MOC), and State Ministry of Research and Technology 
(Menristek), as well as the WHO, World Bank, FAO, USAID, 
AUSAID, DFID, Singapore, Korea, and Japan.    Bayu said the 
two goals for the meeting were to share information on the 
GOI's AI strategy, and coordinate and synergize GOI and 
donor AI activities. 
 
¶3. (U) An official from Bappenas gave a brief synopsis of 
the GOI's National Strategy on AI Control and Prevention, 
highlighting its two main strategies and six goals, as well 
as detailing the budgetary challenges and funding gaps in 
the various ministries.  He noted that the GOI's "AI Control 
Cost Plan" calls for spending of Rp 1.9, 2.4 and 2.2 
trillion rupiah in 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively (USD 
203, 256, and 235 million respectively at current exchange 
rates).  In addition, the budget for Pandemic Influenza 
Preparedness amounts to Rp 738, 792 and 907 billion in 2006, 
2007 and 2008 respectively (USD 79, 85, and 97 million 
respectively at current exchange rates).  He thanked donors 
for their current and planned financial and technical 
support, but urged that they quickly complete the assistance 
matrix the UNDP is preparing for the GOI. (Note: UNDP is 
helping Komnas prepare a matrix of donor assistance and GOI 
funding to allow the GOI to determine funding gaps).

¶4. (U) Bayu noted the GOI's AI strategy is on track 
following the formulation of a National AI Plan in December 
2005 and the launch of its implementation in January 2006. 
He admitted, however, that given the notable rise in human 
AI cases in 2006, the GOI needs to refocus and adjust its 
strategy and was thus welcomes input from donors.  For that 
reason, the GOI would host June 21-23 a WHO-led technical 
review/assessment of its AI strategy, with participation 
from the World Bank and FAO. (Note: CDC influenza specialist 
Dr. Tim Uyeki will in the review).  Bayu added that the GOI 
will also hold a workshop in early July to enable donors to 
present concrete funding plans in support of Indonesia's 
national AI strategy. 
 
¶5. (U) Bayu said the GOI will emphasize the following six 
priorities over the next 18 months: 
 
--Conducting an information and public awareness campaign 
focusing on children and family; the media; decision makers 
such as GOI officials, politicians, doctors and 
veterinarians; high-risk groups such as poultry traders and 
farmers; and the general public. 
 
--Sharpening the GOI's focus on the AI virus in poultry and 
birds.  Bayu said that with 194 districts AI endemic, the 
GOI needs a massive surveillance program. In that regard, he 
thanked the FAO for its newly launched surveillance program 
funded by USAID. 
 
--Developing a proper compensation program for culled birds, 
without which required depopulation of infected areas would 
be very difficult. 
 
--Improving human surveillance and preparedness, including a 
focus on personal protective equipment (PPE), isolation 
rooms and anti-virals. 
 
--Conducting pandemic preparedness simulations: The GOI 
plans to conduct simulations in three areas (not specified), 
although more are clearly needed. 
 
--Increasing research and investigation to address many 
answered questions, especially with respect to human AI 
clusters. 
 
¶6. (U) In the discussion that followed, the MOA requested 
more direct operational support to supplement ongoing 
technical assistance.  The World Bank called for a freer 
flow of information from the GOI, citing as an example the 
lack of specifics and GOI conclusions about the recent large 
human AI cluster in North Sumatra (ref).  In reply, Bayu 
said the government has been open with its communications, 
especially via the WHO and FAO.  He then remarked that 
limited human-to-human transmission had taken place in the 
Medan cluster case.  Asked why this was not yet in the 
public domain since several ministers discounted that 
possibility, Bayu agreed that the GOI needed help to 
initiate a good communication strategy, but that it would 
need to be "tailored to Indonesia with its extremely free

media." 
 
Muhammadiyah Supports AI Prevention Efforts 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) Indonesia's second largest mass Islamic organization, 
Muhammadiyah, announced plans to support the GOI's efforts 
to control and prevent AI at a June 7 ceremony attended by 
senior officials from the Coordinating Ministry for People's 
Welfare, the MOH, and MOA, and representatives of 
universities and professional organizations.  The Chairman 
of Muhammadiyah's Health Council, Dr. Natsir Nugroho, and 
the Chairman of Muhammadiyah's Central Board Dr. Sudibyo 
Markus opened the event and Minister of Health Siti Fadilah 
Supari formally the launched the program.  Natsir stressed 
the need for broad participation from the GOI, NGOs and the 
wider community to prevent the spread of AI, and adequately 
prepare for a possible pandemic.  Markus claimed that 
Muhammadiyah's nationwide community-based network would 
support this effort, using its vast network of universities, 
schools, hospitals and other independent organizations to 
"socialize" the public about the dangers posed by AI and the 
need for preventative measures.  Markus later told the press 
there would be a fund raising component to the project, and 
a "train the trainers" program with a budget of around Rp 20 
billion rupiah (USD 2.1 million).  Minister Fadilah thanked 
Muhammadiyah for its involvement in addressing socioeconomic 
and health problems and its willingness to join the GOI in 
its fight against AI.  The Minister also thanked USAID and 
AUSAID for their AI assistance. 
 
Human AI Case Profile

¶8. (U) In the past week, the number of confirmed H5N1 cases

deaths (76 percent). 
 
¶9. (SBU) NAMRU-2 data indicates the following AI-related
