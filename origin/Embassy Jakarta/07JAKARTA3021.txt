¶1. On October 29, Indonesian First Lady Ani Bambang Yudhoyono 
continued to raise her profile (reftel) by launching Alun Alun, a 
high-end boutique for Indonesian cultural products aimed at 
promoting small and medium-sized artisan businesses.  The First Lady 
expressed hope that the venture also will raise the profile of 
Indonesia indigenous products within Indonesian and around the 
world. The boutique will provide customers with a one stop shop for 
high quality Indonesian items, including a broad array of 
handicrafts, jewelry, clothing and culinary products.  Trade Minster 
Mari Pangestu, who also spoke at the launch, noted that Alun Alun 
would assist its artisan suppliers in upgrading the packaging and 
presentation of their products for international markets.  Pangestu 
also commented that Alun Alun's management team is considering 
expanding the shop to overseas locations to promote trade in 
Indonesian cultural goods. 
 
¶2. The First Lady remarked that the Alun Alun project closely 
aligned with her vision for an Indonesia with a strong sense of its 
own culture and a respect for its diverse traditions.  While she 
noted that openness to influence from foreign cultures is important, 
she believes that foreign influence should enrich Indonesia's 
existing culture rather than replace it.  She hopes that the Alun 
Alun venture will promote prosperity for its artisan suppliers while 
strengthening the domestic and international reputation of 
Indonesian goods.
