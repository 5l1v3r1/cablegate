¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  This is an action request.  Assistant Secretary 
Hill visited the Sidoarjo mudflow site in May 2007 and indicated to 
GOI officials that we were looking for ways to help.  In September 
2007, a US technical expert identified potential ways to help 
Indonesia mitigate the humanitarian, economic, and environmental 
damage caused by the mudflow (Ref C).  However, despite general 
agreement that U.S. technical assistance could help mitigate the 
damage without entangling us in Indonesian domestic controversies, 
we have yet to identify funding for these initiatives.  Officials at 
the Sidoarjo Mud Management Agency (BPLS) continue to request US 
help to mitigate the disaster and relocate critical infrastructure. 
Post requests Washington's assistance to identify funding sources 
for proposed USG assistance.   End Summary. 
 
No Interest in Blame Game 
------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Since the mudflow began in May 2006, more than a dozen 
villages have been inundated and critical infrastructure has been 
destroyed or is currently threatened.  Assistant Secretary Hill 
visited the mudflow site in May 2007 and indicated to GOI officials 
that we were looking for ways to help.  Each passing day brings new 
humanitarian hardships, flaming geysers, and land subsidence.  The 
political debate rages on, with the majority of East Javans blaming 
Lapindo Brantas, the energy company associated with Coordinating 
Minister for Social Welfare Aburizal Bakrie, while the political 
elite blame natural causes.  The US has no interest in commenting on 
the causes of the disaster.  Rather, our interest lies in helping 
Indonesian officials mitigate the mudflow's impact on critical 
infrastructure, livelihoods, homes, and businesses.  We believe that 
US technical assistance will add much-needed impartial scientific 
authority to those who wish to mitigate present and future effects. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In light of these factors, we believe US assistance should 
include technical analysis and advice not otherwise available, and 
focus solely on disaster mitigation of the mudflow and the worsening 
humanitarian crises caused by it.  We will not be party to 
determinations of liability. 
 
What makes Sense? 
----------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) A US Geological Survey geologist visited BPLS on 
September 21, 2007 to discuss challenges BPLS faces in managing the 
mudflow.  Since then we understand the State Department, USAID, USGS 
and US Army Corps of Engineers have met in the US to discuss ways to 
help.  Congen Surabaya and BPLS continue to meet regularly in 
Indonesia.  We agreed on a three-stage plan, each informing the 
next: 1) A site survey team visit, 2) mapping of the site using 
Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology, and 3)Placement of a 
US Expert on-site for a year, subject to quarterly review. 
 
Site Survey Team 
---------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) A team of US geologists would confer on-site with BPLS 
about current conditions and the significance of proposed LIDAR 
survey data for mitigation efforts and infrastructure relocation. 
The site survey team would also assess the need and potential role 
for a resident U.S. Geologist on site (described below).  Survey 
team members would create terms of reference and advise the Mission 
on drafting an MOU for the long-term position.  The survey team 
would stay for a period to be determined, but probably on the order 
of two to three weeks.  We request that each agency fund the 
participation of its members of the inter-agency team.  Three key 
goals of management include: 1) Disposal of the mud; 2) Maintenance 
of containment structures, and 3) Identification of suitable 
corridors to relocate critical infrastructure.  If stages two and 
three are needed based on the teams assessment, then an appropriate 
MOU for each stage will be drafted by Congen Surabaya in concert 
 
JAKARTA 00000659  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
with the Site Survey Team lead and BPLS. 
 
Mapping the Mud with LIDAR 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) We understand that representatives from the USGS, the US 
Army Corps of Engineers, and the US Naval Oceanographic Office met 
in Alabama on February 14, 2008 to discuss technical needs for a 
LIDAR survey of the mudflow. LIDAR would provide a high-precision 
topography map to serve as a baseline for planning a long term mud 
management strategy.  We understand that the Alabama team prepared a 
technical proposal for the LIDAR survey, including costs estimates 
and post-survey data analysis.  The team discussed using LIDAR to: 
 
¶1. Identify the size and shape of mud accumulation area; 
¶2. Identify the size and shape of subsidence-affected area; 
¶3. Determine the rates of mud accumulation and ground subsidence; 
¶4. Map sediment movement in river and coastal waters; 
¶5. Map the directional flow of mud on land to identify suitable 
corridors to relocate critical infrastructure; and 
¶6. Plan for post-data collection analysis. 
 
Looking Ahead--A Resident US Expert on-site 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Based on an assessment of the survey team, a U.S. 
mitigation expert/advisor could be made available to BPLS for a one 
year period.  The mitigation expert would have offices in Consulate 
Surabaya and be hosted by BPLS.  We would reassess prospects for 
continued cooperation quarterly in concert with an activity/progress 
report to be written by the expert. 
 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The costs of the survey team visit would include air 
travel and per diem for two or three experts for 10 to 14 days.  The 
total estimated cost of three overflights and related data analysis 
for the LIDAR survey is $2 million.  We understood from State/EAP 
that it would allocate $300,000 from an unspecified source for U.S. 
technical assistance as outlined above.  Post would appreciate 
updated information regarding the status of these funds.
