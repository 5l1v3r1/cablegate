¶1.  The following information is current as of 17:00 local time. 
 
CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND 
 
¶2.  Search and rescue operations continue.  Road access continues to 
be severely limited, with three of the four major access roads into 
Padang completed closed and the fourth severely damaged.  Although 
the GOI has the supplies in place it has not yet been able to 
deliver the basics - saline solution, antibiotics, splints, and 
triage materials - to doctors and hospitals.  The airport is open 
although there are major delays.  There are reports that the airport 
will be forced to close this evening due to a lack of fuel.  The 
major universities have sustained severe damage.  A number of 
schools have collapsed and rescue operations are under way.  A six 
year resident Amcit who left Padang for Jakarta passport and relief 
from the earthquake zone reports that there has been widespread 
looting. 
 
DEATHS AND INJURIES 
 
¶3.  There has been no reliable adjustment to the dead and injured 
figures reported reftel.  We still have not had any reports of 
injured Americans. 
 
CONSULAR MATTERS 
 
¶4. The Padang team, which includes one consular officer with 
Department of Justice law enforcement assistance (ICITAP) staffers, 
has found no/no deceased or injured Amcits after visiting all Padang 
area hospitals and morgues.  We are continuing to track Amcits and 
none have been in distress. 
 
¶5.  Satphone and email service from Padang is spotty, cell phone SMS 
and voice works best.  The CCD Crisis Consular Task Force database 
is either slow or inoperative, Jakarta's IM staff is working on a 
fix, but it makes recording Amcit data in CCD slow or impossible at 
times.  We are emailing our findings to CA and neighboring posts.  A 
second consular officer with an additional ICITAP forensic scientist 
will arrive on Sat.  One consular officer and at least one ICITAP 
staffer will remain in Padang from Sunday to Tuesday, with emergency 
funds in hand. 
 
¶6.  We are in regular contact with friendly country consular 
officers in Jakarta and are assisting them locate their citizens 
through our officers in Padang.  Jakarta has seen only one Amcit 
from Padang seeking a passport.  He is a long term resident of 
Padang and will return there later.  We issued a second warden email 
and SMS message that advises Amcits to contact Jakarta or our 
consular officer at the Padang Hotel.  We have fielded about 50 
inquiries regarding Amcits.  Jakarta's consular section will be open 
Saturday, 8 am to 12 noon local time, to follow up with tracking 
Amcits and answering inquiries, but will not be open to the public. 
All other consular and visa activities continue as normal. 
 
USG EFFORTS 
 
¶7.  USG efforts remain as reported reftel. We are coordinating 
closely with the GOI, as well as NGOs and other governments. 
Embassy's Emergency Coordinating Officers will meet Saturday morning 
to assess needs. 
 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
 
¶8.  Foreign Assistance is starting to arrive more rapidly.  Most of 
the assistance is cash and search and rescue personnel.  In addition 
to reftel reports, Singapore has sent 42 SAR personnel, Switzerland 
has sent a SAR team, and China is sending money and SAR teams. 
 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS 
 
¶9.  The local press has covered extensively President Obama's 
statement of support for the Indonesian people.  The press is also 
quoting Department spokesman, Kelly announcing the release of 
USD300, 000. 
 
NEXT REPORT 
 
¶10.  Post will send next sitrep Saturday morning, local time.
