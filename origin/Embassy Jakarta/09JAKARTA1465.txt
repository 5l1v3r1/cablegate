SUBJECT: RAMADAN IN INDONESIA -- AMID FASTING AND 
RESTRICTIONS ON ENTERTAINMENT, A FESTIVE AIR 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  Indonesia's over 200 million Muslims are 
observing the month of Ramadan in festive fashion with a 
constant round of Iftaar (breaking fast) events.  Per local 
government orders, night clubs, massage parlors and saunas 
are shut, while karaoke and live music venues are maintaining 
limited hours of operation.  Local officials have been more 
forceful this year than in the past in pressing for closures. 
 Non-Muslim areas of this very diverse country are not 
imposing bans.  There have been no reports of the sort of 
Islamic extremist vigilante activity that happened in the 
past.  Mission is hosting a series of Iftaars in honor of the 
season.  END SUMMARY. 
 
FASTING--AND BREAKING FAST 
 
¶2.  The sounds, sights and smells of Iftaars (breaking fast 
events) fill Jakarta each evening as families and friends 
gather to break their Ramadan fast.  (Note:  Ramadan began on 
August 21 and ends on September 19.  Ramadan is followed by 
the Idul Fitri holiday.)   The vast majority of Indonesia's 
over 200 million Muslims fast from dawn to dusk in accordance 
with the five pillars of Islam.  Despite the hardship of 
fasting in a hot, humid climate and the closure of many 
restaurants during the day, the anticipation and preparation 
for countless Iftaars (or "Buka Puasa" in Bahasa Indonesia) 
creates a festive atmosphere.  In addition to the Iftaars, 
many Indonesians gather before dawn to enjoy a communal meal 
with friends and family. 
 
¶3.  The Ambassador and DCM are hosting a series of Iftaars in 
honor of the season.  Mission has also publicized the 
President's Ramadan message. 
 
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS 
 
¶4.  For the Ramadan timeframe, local governments have imposed 
restrictions on entertainment-related activities.  Jakarta 
officials, for example, have ordered the closure of over 
1,0000 entertainment venues such as night clubs, massage 
parlors and saunas while karaoke and live music venues have 
limited hours of operation.  (Note:  Five-star hotels are 
exempt from the ban.) 
 
¶5.  Local officials generally have been more forceful than in 
year's past in pressing for the closures.  Punishments for 
violating the closure orders range from warnings to 
revocation of business licenses.  Officials have reported 
that more and more businesses are voluntarily complying and 
violations are on the decrease.  In 2008, only 11 businesses 
violated Jakarta bylaws versus 37 in 2005.  Although most 
provinces maintain similar regulations, non-Muslim majority 
areas do not impose bans or force closures. 
 
¶6.  Analysts estimate that the entertainment industry will 
experience a 60 percent drop in revenue for the month of 
Ramadan as compared to other months.  We have been told that 
the number of Japanese and Korean tourists has plummeted due 
to the restrictions.  Economic hardship can be particularly 
burdensome in the more religiously conservative provinces 
that maintain stringent bans.  That said, in a nod to 
economic realities, local government and religious leaders in 
South Tangerang District of conservative Banten Province near 
Jakarta have announced that they would not force 
entertainment venues to close because of the financial 
hardships that would be incurred by workers. 
 
¶7.  Although overall inflation in Indonesia has remained 
relatively low this year, the demand for food staples has 
caused a slight increase in prices thus far.  Muslims, in a 
celebratory mood, tend to spend heavily during the month of 
Ramadan, particularly through eating, drinking and gift 
giving during their many Iftaar and other activities. 
 
NO VIGILANTE ACTIVITIES REPORTED SO FAR 
 
¶8.  In the recent past, a number of hardline Muslim vigilante 
groups have taken the law into their own hands and engaged in 
illegal "sweeping" raids of entertainment venues during 
Ramadan.  Peaking in 2005, these raids have been on a steady 
decline, with only occasional flare-ups throughout the 
country since then.  To date, there have been no reports of 
vigilante violence so far.  Despite the calm, extremists are 
still a presence in Indonesia and government officials remain 
alert.
