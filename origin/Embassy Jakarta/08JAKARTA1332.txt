SUBJECT: NOAA SCIENCE FELLOW TRAINS INDONESIAN MEDIA 
 
¶1.  Embassy Jakarta's Science Fellow conducted three media training 
events in Jakarta in late June to early July.  Dr. Mary Baker of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration used the events to 
teach reporters, editors, and managers about coral issues in 
Indonesia: what is coral, why it is important, what threats to coral 
are, and what can be done about threats.  Discussions covered wide 
ranging topics from the use of seaweed as biofuels to why urban poor 
should care about coral.  A PowerPoint file, frequently asked 
questions, and "things you can do" document was provided in English 
and Indonesian, and is available for future trainings. 
 
¶2.  On June 24, Embassy Jakarta arranged for Dr. Baker to train 
15-20 reporters at ANTV, a major national television station based 
in Jakarta.  Reporters were highly interested in whether the 
Government of Indonesia (GOI) would take action to address threats, 
especially illegal fishing using explosives and cyanide.  They 
raised thoughtful questions about how to get the public to care 
about the environment, given the other more pressing socioeconomic 
circumstances in their daily lives. 
 
¶3.  The second training session was on June 27 for five reporters at 
Suara Pembaruan, a national daily newspaper.  Reporters had many 
questions on the relative status of coral health between Indonesia, 
the Philippines, and the U.S.A.  They were curious about research on 
the use of seaweed as a biofuel.  They also asked about effects of 
earthquakes on coral. 
 
¶4.  The third training session was for seven reporters at Koran 
Tempo, another national daily newspaper, on July 1.  Reporters 
wanted more information about illegal reef fishing using explosives 
and cyanide.  They discussed reporting techniques, including 
evaluating multiple perspectives and methods to identify spurious 
research claims.
