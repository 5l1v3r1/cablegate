To. H.E. Dr. Jane Lubchenco 
Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, and 
Administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
14th Street and Constitution Avenue, Room 5128 
Washington, DC 20002 
 
Dear Excellency Dr. Lubchenco, 
 
First, please allow me to congratulate you on your selection as the 
new NOAA Administrator.  Many of us around the world are very 
pleased to see that the United States government has put more 
emphasis on climate change, the environment, and oceans, and I look 
forward to working with you. 
 
I also wanted to follow up on my earlier invitation to you to join 
me at the first ever World Ocean Conference.  Indonesia will host 
the WOC in Manado, North Sulawesi from May 11-15 2009.  The 
conference will focus on the theme of "Climate Change Impacts to the 
Ocean" and the Role of Oceans in Climate Change".  As part of the 
WOC, ocean ministers and heads of delegation from around the world 
will discuss and sign the Manado Ocean Declaration, a statement to 
establish the important role the ocean plays in climate change and a 
call to action for all costal nations to understand and adapt to 
climate change impacts in a sustainable way.  The WOC will be 
followed by a Coral Triangle Initiative Summit. 
 
Recognizing NOAA's leadership in this area and our strong 
partnership on ocean issues, I had invited NOAA to send the 
exploration and research vessel Okeanos Explorer to Indonesia for 
the World Ocean Conference.  Unfortunately, the Okeanos Explorer 
cannot come to Indonesia at this time, but I am pleased that NOAA is 
committed to a long-term partnership with Indonesia on ocean 
exploration and research. 
 
Excellency, 
I believe a strong NOAA presence at WOC is even more desirable and 
important.  I look forward to hosting you in Manado, and hope you 
will support active participation by NOAA staff in the WOC itself 
and all the side events activities.  In particular, I would like to 
invite you to attend the Global Ocean Policy Day and the 
Ministerial/High-level meeting of WOC scheduled on May 13 and 14, 
respectively. 
 
Excellency, 
I also believe NOAA participation in the WOC symposia and display 
exhibition would highlight our important cooperation in many aspects 
of marine and fisheries sector.  To help facilitate NOAA 
participation, I have asked WOC organizers to fully assist Your 
Excellency's team in registration and other preparations leading to 
the WOC.  Should you need more information about WOC, please do not 
hesitate to contact me or visit the website www.woc209.org. 
 
Finally, I want to want to reiterate my sincere appreciation to your 
kind consideration and I look forward to welcoming you to Manado in 
May. 
 
With Very Highest Regards,
