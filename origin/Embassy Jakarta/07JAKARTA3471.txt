From Ambassador Hume to Director Fore, U/S Dobriansky and CEQ 
Chairman Connaughton 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: The United States and Indonesia have real 
opportunities within the bilateral relationship to move their 
respective environmental agendas forward.  The Government of 
Indonesia used the recently concluded UN Climate Change Conference 
in Bali to highlight its environmental resources and challenges. 
President Yudhoyono appreciated the contributions to forest and 
coral reef conservation we announced at the conference.  Our 
continued support for Indonesia's environmental priorities - 
sustainable forestry, the Coral Triangle Initiative, and clean 
technology transfer - will help preserve Indonesia's biodiversity 
and win Indonesian support for our climate change priorities.  End 
summary. 
 
Winning Support for U.S. Climate Change Policy 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2. (SBU) Indonesia took advantage of its role as host of the recent 
United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 13) on Climate Change 
to showcase its extraordinary environmental resources and 
challenges.  President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Minister of Marine 
Affairs Freddy Numberi and Minister of Forestry Malem Sambet Kaban 
thanked the U.S. publicly for our support of Indonesia's key 
environmental programs, including $19.6 million for Tropical Forest 
Conservation Act (TFCA) debt redirection, $4.35 million for the 
regional Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI), and $2.8 million for 
bilateral biodiversity and climate change programs, including 
support of the Indonesian Action Plan for Orangutan Conservation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We can build on these programs to buttress Indonesia's 
environmental priorities and to garner Indonesian support for our 
climate change policy both in the United Nations and through our 
Major Economies Process.  We propose to focus U.S. bilateral efforts 
on three areas that are most important to Indonesia and us: 
sustainable forestry, the Coral Triangle Initiative and clean 
technology transfer. 
 
Sustainable Forestry 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Eighty-five percent of Indonesia's emissions come from the 
forestry sector (including fires that follow deforestation and the 
draining and burning of peat land).  Sustainable forest management 
is imperative to mitigate climate change.  President Yudhoyono's 
Action Plan for Orangutan Habitat Conservation is designed to manage 
forest resources and protect orangutans' natural habitat.  We 
already support the action plan through the USAID-funded Orangutan 
Conservation Services Program and other programs.  Other 
opportunities for greater bilateral involvement exist.  For example, 
Papuan Governor Barnabas Suebu will lift the logging moratorium in 
his province in January 2008.  He aims to introduce forestry 
management practices that will promote reforestation and conversion 
of already cleared areas into palm oil plantations. 
 
Action Proposals: 
 
-- Offer Papua Governor Barnabas Suebu assistance on logging 
concessions policy as well as forestry monitoring and remote 
sensing, possibly through the U.S. Forestry Service.  A similar 
program should be offered to Aceh Governor Yusuf Irwandi. 
 
-- Encourage investments by U.S. companies such as International 
Paper and Cargill to demonstrate best practices in sustainable 
forestry, plantation development, land-use planning and watershed 
management. 
 
-- Target proceeds from debt redirection under TFCA to support 
forest habitat protection and sustainable community forestry 
programs. 
 
Coral Triangle Initiative 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) President Yudhoyono proposed the Coral Triangle Initiative 
 
 
(CTI) and raised it with President Bush at the September APEC 
summit.  The CTI aims to reverse the rapid degradation of coral reef 
habitats and off-shore fisheries in Indonesia, the Philippines, 
Malaysia and nearby countries.  U.S. funds support the World 
Wildlife Fund and other non-governmental organizations in Indonesia 
to carry out CTI activities.  We should consider other ways to back 
this initiative. 
 
Action Proposals: 
 
-- Invite, in conjunction with Mexican co-chair, Indonesian Minister 
of Marine Affairs Freddy Numberi to present CTI to the January 
International Coral Reef Initiative meeting in Washington. 
 
-- Develop a regional International Visitors Leadership Program 
(IVLP) to highlight U.S. expertise in coral and fisheries 
management. 
 
-- Provide expertise from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration on marine, fisheries and coral issues in response to 
a request from the Ministry of Marine Affairs. 
 
-- Target proceeds from debt redirection under TFCA to support coral 
reef protection programs. 
 
Clean Technology Transfer 
------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Indonesian government is developing a low-carbon growth 
strategy to put Indonesia on a more carbon-neutral development path. 
 Clean technology could play an important role.  But Indonesia 
sometimes questions whether new environmentally friendly 
technologies can be transferred to developing countries at an 
affordable price. 
 
Action Proposals: 
 
-- Use Indonesia as a pilot country to demonstrate that technology 
transfer to developing countries can work.  The Department of 
Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory have developed cutting-edge 
clean technologies, such as the "super boiler." USAID also has 
experience with the transfer of a range of energy efficiency and 
renewable energy technologies. 
 
-- Organize with the U.S. Trade and Development Agency a reverse 
trade mission focusing on clean technology. 
 
Environmental Public Diplomacy 
------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (SBU) We must use media and outreach opportunities to demonstrate 
continued U.S. commitment to combating climate change and promoting 
energy security and to highlight our support for Indonesia's 
efforts.  Our Environment, Science, Technology and Health Section is 
developing a 14-month program of environmental outreach activities 
that will be launched on Earth Day 2008 and continue through UN 
Environment Day 2009. 
 
Action Proposal: 
 
-- Conduct digital video conferences between U.S. officials and 
Indonesian journalists before important meetings in the Major 
Economies Process (such as the late January meeting in Hawaii) to 
explain U.S. policy.
