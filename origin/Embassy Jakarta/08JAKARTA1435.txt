¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  On July 19, Indonesian National Police 
(INP) rescued 111 Indonesian women and girls from three 
Jakarta establishments involved in prostitution.  The 
District Police Chief told us that the three individuals 
arrested will be charged with trafficking in persons and 
other crimes.  USG training assisted the rescue and arrests. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
RESCUE/ARRESTS IN JAKARTA 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The GOI has just completed a major Trafficking in 
Persons (TIP) rescue.  Officers from the West Jakarta police 
sector raided three local establishments on July 19.  During 
the operation, the INP arrested three Indonesians for 
operating forced prostitution rings and TIP.   The police 
rescued 111 Indonesian women and girls (ages 16-17).  The 
three individuals arrested have not yet been formally 
arraigned, but will most likely be charged with operating 
prostitution businesses and trafficking in persons, according 
to Wirdanto Hadicoksono, the Head of the Criminal 
Intelligence Division of the West Jakarta police sector. 
 
USG TRAINING PLAYS ROLE 
 
¶4.  (SBU) USG training paid dividends in assisting the 
rescue/arrest process.  While interviewing the women and 
girls involved, the police realized that some had been held 
against their will--the victims of forced marriages or 
otherwise.  The officer-in-charge immediately contacted the 
regional police command for assistance.  The Regional Head of 
the CID, Major Suyudi Setosent, sent one of his police 
officers to assist with the interviews.  This female officer 
had just completed a DOJ International Criminal Investigation 
Training Assistance Program (ICITAP), Diplomatic Security 
Service (DSS) and Consular Affairs course.  The officer was 
able to confirm the evidence of trafficking thanks in large 
part to the USG training she had just received. 
 
TIP TRAINING COURSES 
 
¶5.  (U) The five-day TIP course provides police and 
prosecutors with focused training on international law, 
counterfeit document recognition, investigation techniques 
and methods to apply Indonesia's trafficking laws when the 
cases go to trial (the law was introduced in 2007).  During 
the course, the officials also learn from DSS, ICITAP and the 
Consular Affairs Fraud Prevention Unit a holistic perspective 
on the local, national and regional implications of human 
trafficking and how it affects the victims and their 
families. 
 
¶6.  (U) The course has been held twice this year (June and 
July) with 25 police officers and 10 prosecutors attending 
each session.  There are three more sessions scheduled for 
¶2008. 
 
POLICE PROACTIVE AGAINST TRAFFICKING 
 
¶7.  (SBU) This latest police action against trafficking 
highlights the continuing problem and the proactive steps the 
INP is taking to address it.  As outlined above, for example, 
USG training is assisting the effort.  Our training is often

the first opportunity that most police get to learn about the 
problem and how to deal with it.
