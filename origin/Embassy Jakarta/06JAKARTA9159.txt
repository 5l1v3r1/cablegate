Summary. The GOI has adjusted its count of victims from the 
July 17 earthquake and tsunami to 493 dead, 954 injured and 
362 missing.  An estimated 74,000 people have been displaced 
but most are expected to be returning to their homes over 
the weekend.  The Indonesian government estimates damages 
(actual and lost tourism) at USD 20 million.  The three- 
person Embassy team returned from the emergency site after 
meeting with GOI officials and relief organizations to 
gather information and concluded that no Americans were 
injured or killed.  National news wires, television and 
print media all carried press release information about the 
USG $50,000 contribution to Red Cross/Red Crescent disaster 
relief in their straight news reporting on July 20.  WHO, in 
conjunction with the District Health office, indicated that 
the emergency phase is over.  Minister of Research and 
Technology Kusmayanto Kadiman admitted that tsunami warnings 
were received from Japan and Hawaii but without adequate 
time to pass on to local communities.  Kadiman noted the 
need for more infrastructure and training to prevent future 
tragedies.  End Summary. 
 
CASUALTIES AND FINANCIAL LOSSES 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. The National Disaster Management and Refugee Coordination 
Board (BAKORNAS BPP) confirmed that casualties from the July 
17 earthquake and tsunami include 493 dead, 954 injured and 
362 missing.  BAKORNAS PBP additionally estimates that 
74,000 people have been displaced from their homes but the 
majority will be returning home over the weekend.  The death 
count decreased as BAKORNAS PBP crosschecked statistics 
among its coordinating teams in Central Java, West Java and 
Yogyakarta.  Officials said more casualties are expected as 
rescue teams continue to search for survivors and dead 
bodies among the rubble of houses and buildings.  The 
Indonesian government estimates damages (actual and lost 
tourism) at USD 20 million. 
 
AMERICAN CITIZENS 
----------------- 
 
¶3. Embassy Consular and Regional Security staff returned to 
Jakarta on July 20 from the site of the tsunami.  To date, 
there is still no indication of any Americans missing, 
injured, or deceased as a result of the tsunami.  Post still 
has 8 open Welfare/Whereabouts cases, though most of those 
cases are for people believed to be in Bali or Lombok and 
not in the affected area.  The USAID team member returned on 
July 21. 
 
EMERGENCY RESPONSE 
------------------ 
 
¶4. At July 20 UN Donor Coordination Meeting, the World 
Health Organization (WHO), in conjunction with the District 
Health office, indicated that the emergency phase is over. 
Patient load has dropped and there is adequate medical staff 
to handle medical needs.  UN staff reported that an office 
will be established for UN Agencies in Pangandaran. 
Coordination meetings will be held every day with NGOs, with 
UN Agencies taking the lead as follows: UN Children's Fund 
(UNICEF) for education, child protection and 
water/sanitation; International Federation of Red Cross and 
Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) for shelter; World Food 
Program for food and nutrition; and World Health 
Organization for health.  USAID provision of $50,000 to the 
Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) through IFRC enabled PMI to 
immediately deploy volunteers, transport relief items, set 
up feeding kitchens and distribute nonfood items.  PMI was 
one of the first organizations to deploy staff and assist 
vulnerable groups. 
 
LESSONS LEARNED 
--------------- 
 
¶5. The tsunami hit less than three weeks after the Indian 
Ocean's regional network was declared active.  Set up in 
 
JAKARTA 00009159  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
response to the December 2004 tsunami, the network comprises 
26 out of a possible 29 national centers, which receive 
information bulletins in real time from monitors in Japan 
and Hawaii.  Warnings from Hawaii and Japan were issued via 
e-mail, fax and a dedicated telecommunication system after 
the July 17 earthquake was detected, but Indonesian 
officials could not relay the warnings in time to residents. 
 
¶6. Science and Technology Minister Kusmayanto Kadiman 
admitted on July 20 that the nation received bulletins from 
the Hawaii center and Japan's Meteorological Agency right 
before the tsunami on July 17. At that time, the Indonesian 
Meteorological and Geophysical Agency (BMG) had sent short 
text messages via cell phone to 400 government officials and 
mass media but the giant waves moved within 20 minutes. 
Kadiman noted that Indonesia needs to install early warning 
detectors in every 10 kilometers in Indonesian waters, 
especially in West Sumatra and South Java.  Germany has 
donated 10 early warning devices but only two of them were 
installed and those were quickly vandalized by fishermen. 
Government officials are blaming each other for the 
ineffective early warning system communication.  Experts and 
officials agreed that additional infrastructure investment 
and training is needed for disaster early warning and 
community preparedness.  Donor assistance in supporting such 
efforts will likely be required.
