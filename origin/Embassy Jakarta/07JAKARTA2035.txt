¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: On July 20 Indonesian authorities carried 
out the largest and most successful operation to date against 
distributors of counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Jakarta Police 
raided a small retail pharmacy followed by an associated 
warehouse serving as a distribution center for imported 
counterfeit medicines.  Police seized over one hundred and 
fifty 50 kg bags filled with counterfeit product.  This 
latest seizure took place less than a month after Indonesian 
Police closed down two optical disk factories suspected of 
illegal production on July 1 (reftel B).  END SUMMARY 
 
Drugstore Cowboys 
----------------- 
¶2.  (SBU)   Indonesian police raided a small pharmacy in 
Jakarta on July 20 and seized six large 50kg bags filled with 
counterfeit medicines.  Evidence collected from the site 
confirmed the location of a nearby warehouse suspected of 
importing and distributing illegal and counterfeit 
pharmaceutical products.  Indonesian authorities raided the 
second location seizing 150 additional 50kg bags containing 
counterfeit prescription medications.  The medicines were 
packaged with brand-name corporate markings, such as Pfizer, 
Galxo Smith Kline, Bauer and Roche among others.  Further 
investigation by Police investigators revealed the medicines 
were imported directly from India and intended for retail 
distribution in Jakarta. Several individuals were detained 
for questioning; however the owner of the premises evaded 
police and is still at large. 
 
Technical Assistance Continues to Pay Off 
----------------------------------------- 
¶3.  (SBU) GOI law enforcement authorities benefited from 
intelligence and technical assistance provided through the 
State Department/INL-funded, Department of Justice 
International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance 
Program (ICITAP).  ICITAP advisors provided surveillance and 
operational planning training as well as specific 
intelligence on the targeted locations.  USG-funded ICITAP 
consultants familiar with the operation commented that links 
between counterfeit pharmaceutical distribution and organized 
crime remain unclear. 
 
GOI on a Roll 
------------- 
¶4.  (SBU)  These counterfeit drug raids come on the heels of 
Indonesia's crack down on violations of optical disk laws. 
GOI is clearly benefiting from USG engagement on IPR issues, 
and Indonesian law enforcement continues to make effective 
use of USG-funded technical assistance.  The seizures should 
also assuage the concerns of pharmaceutical companies who 
feel neglected as compared to the attention given to optical 
disk piracy.  Cumulative results from recent IPR-related 
raids and seizures further strengthens Post's recommendation 
for increased support of IPR-related assistance to GOI, 
including extension of the ICITAP program for another year 
and development of DOJ/OPDAT assistance to the Attorney 
General's Office to ensure successful prosecutions.
