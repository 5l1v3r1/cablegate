¶2.  (SBU) Poloff delivered Ref A demarche re Internally 
Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Pakistan to Cicilia Rusdiharini, 
Deputy Director for American Affairs at the Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DEPLU), on June 2.  We underscored that the 
situation in Pakistan was in a critical phase and that the 
Pakistani government needed urgent assistance regarding the 
unfolding humanitarian crisis.  We noted that the United 
States has already announced significant support to Pakistan. 
 Many other countries had already responded positively to the 
UN's appeal for international assistance.  We urged 
Indonesia, as a leading Muslim-majority democracy, to 
consider urgently contributing to this humanitarian effort. 
 
¶3.  (U) Rusdiharini said GOI officials were still reviewing 
the matter based on our previous demarche.  She promised that 
Indonesia would consider USG views on the subject. 
 
¶4.  (U) Mission is also in contact with other Missions of 
countries that have contributed to the UN appeal, such as 
Japan and South Korea, urging them to join in the approach to 
the GOI.
