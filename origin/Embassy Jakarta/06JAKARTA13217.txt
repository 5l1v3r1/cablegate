     ¶E. STATE 182628 (RESPONSE TO GOI DIPNOTE) 
 
¶1. (SBU)  On November 15 we met with Harry Purwanto, 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Director for North and 
Central America, to present demarches on Belarus' anti-U.S. 
resolutions (ref A) and to solicit support for the candidacy 
of Michael Matheson to the International Law Commission (ref 
B). 
 
2.(SBU) Purwanto was familiar with the Belarus problem from 
our presentation to him of our views on country-specific 
issues last week (ref C).  Puwanto accepted our points and 
undertook to convey them with the Directorate of Multilateral 
Affairs. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Puwanto was similarly familiar with Mr. Matheson's 
ILC candidacy.  He thanked us for our presentation and 
promised to coordinate our latest approach with the Director 
General for Multilateral Affairs. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment.  With regard to Belarus' anti-U.S. 
resolutions, we believe that - for once - the GOI's 
longstanding aversion to country-specific resolutions will 
work in our favor.  Although Indonesia's voting decision will 
likely be made in New York without guidance from Jakarta, the 
GOI will probably resist being drawn into this dispute on the 
side of Belarus.  Concerning Mr. Matheson's ILC candidacy, 
the GOI has already proposed a vote swap (ref D) which we 
have rebuffed (ref E).  This being the case, the GOI is 
unlikely to openly declare its support for Mr. Matheson, 
although it is not entirely out of the question that 
Indonesia might vote for him in the end.  End comment
