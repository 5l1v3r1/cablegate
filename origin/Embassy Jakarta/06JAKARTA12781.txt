REF: A) Jakarta 11582    B) Jakarta 12253 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary. The Government of Indonesia (GOI) released 2007 
budget information on October 19 but has not yet finalized its AI 
spending allocations in the Ministries of Health (MOH) and 
Agriculture (MOA).  Coordinating Minister for Peoples' Welfare 
Aburizal Bakrie convened an interagency meeting on October 20 to 
discuss latest efforts to control the spread of the virus and AI 
spending.  The GOI is unlikely to provide additional information 
concerning avian influenza funding until GOI offices re-open on 
October 31 after the Idul Fitri holiday.  NAMRU-2 reports two new 
fatal cases confirmed for the H5N1 virus since Ref B.  As of 
October 20, NAMRU-2 data reflect 72 confirmed cases with 55 
fatalities. End Summary. 
 
GOI Announces 2007 Budget Numbers 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Parliament passed the 2007 budget on October 17.  Although 
the GOI released budget allocations for each ministry, the 
Ministry of Finance has not finalized spending plans for 
individual programs, including the GOI's anti-AI efforts. The GOI 
administers most avian influenza funding through the MOH, MOA, 
and Ministry of Finance, but other agencies such as the 
Coordinating Ministry for Peoples' Welfare (overseeing the 
National AI Committee) receive AI funding too.  The various 
ministries will now review their priorities in conjunction with 
the Finance Ministry to determine allocations of their budgets to 
various programs, including avian influenza.

¶3. (SBU) Dr. Tri Satya Putri Naipospos (Dr. Tata), Vice Executive 
Secretary to the National Committee on Avian Influenza Management 
 
SIPDIS 
and Pandemic Alert (KOMNAS) reports that KOMNAS has not yet 
received detailed information about the 2007 planned avian 
influenza funding levels.  She noted, however, that Vice 
President Kalla has repeatedly pledged that total avian influenza 
funding will match if not exceed 2006 levels.  Dr. Tata told us 
on October 19 that Coordinating Minister Ir. Aburizal Bakrie 
would convene an October 20 interagency meeting to discuss latest 
efforts to control the spread of the avian influenza virus at 
which participants may discuss funding issues.  However, she 
noted information about the meeting is unlikely to be made 
available until GOI offices reopen on October 31 after the Idul 
Fitri holiday. 
 
NAMRU-2 Human AI Case Profile 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) NAMRU-2 reports two new, fatal human H5N1 cases since 
Ref B.  The first case involves a 12 year-old boy from South 
Jakarta who reported to a local hospital on October 7. 
Initially diagnosed with dengue, the boy developed shortness of 
breath and was transferred to Bintaro hospital on October 12 and 
then Sulianti Sarosa Infectious Disease Hospital. Doctors placed 
the patient on a ventilator the same day, but he died on October 
¶14.   The second case involves a 30 year-old female from Sigedang 
village, Madukoro, Bajarnegara, Central Java.  She reported to a 
clinic on October 11 after six days of fever, cough, sore throat 
and shortness of breath.  On October 12, she was transferred to 
Banyumas Hospital where she died October 13. Both patients had 
contact with dying poultry. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In addition to these deaths, a critically ill 67-year 
old female cited in Ref B died on October 15, after spending nine 
days in the hospital.  This case was of clinical note as the 
woman showed symptoms of encephalitis although NAMRU2 found 
evidence of no other pathogen with the exception of H5N1. 
 
¶6. (SBU) NAMRU-2 data indicates the following AI-related case 
profile as of October 20: 
 
-- Number of laboratory confirmed (positive PCR and/or serology) 
human AI cases: 72, of which 55 have been fatal (case fatality 
rate of 77 percent). 
 
-- Number of probable AI cases 3 (2 deaths, 67%). 
 
-- Number of cases awaiting analysis at the U.S. CDC: 3. 
 
-- Number of possible untested AI cases under investigation (last 
30 days): approximately 28. 
 
Note: NAMRU-2 data corresponds with MOH data but may vary at 
times with AI case figures presented on the official World Health 
Organization (WHO) website, which usually lags NAMRU-2 data by 
one week.  The WHO website, last updated on October 16, notes 72 
human AI cases in Indonesia with 55 deaths.  WHO figures can be 
accessed at www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza.
