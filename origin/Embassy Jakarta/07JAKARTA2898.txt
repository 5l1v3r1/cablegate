¶1. (U) Summary:  The Indonesian firm PT. Sarigema Dinamika 
(Sarigema) confirmed on October 2 its order of circuit cards for F-5 
aircraft radio communication detailed in Ref A.  Sarigema supplies 
the Indonesian Air Force (IAF) with aviation, communication, 
navigation and radar equipment, products and parts.  An IAF officer 
confirmed on October 3 that Sarigema is indeed a registered supplier 
on the IAF's supply list and that IAF placed an order with the 
company for F-5 circuit cards for radio communication equipment. 
End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On October 2, PT Sarigema Purchasing Officer Teresia 
Suryawijayati confirmed that the company received an order from IAF 
on July 24, 2007 to procure radio communication equipment detailed 
in Ref A for IAF F-5 aircraft, which is scheduled for delivery in 
November 2007.  Sarigema placed the purchase order with one of its 
U.S. suppliers, Sun Aviation, Inc., located at 10010 East 87th 
Street, Raytown, MO 64138, U.S.A.  Suryawijayati said that those 
orders will be shipped by air from U.S. vendors via Singapore as 
there is only one direct flight from the U.S. to Indonesia (Guam to 
Bali).  Sarigema uses a local air forwarder Mega Indah Cargo (Mega), 
which has a warehouse at the Singapore airport, as noted in Ref A, 
for transit before shipping to Jakarta.  Mega then delivers the 
components to Sarigema before they go to the warehouse at Halim Air 
Force Base, where all IAF's procurement orders are received. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We contacted Deputy Director of Electronic Combat Equipment 
Colonel Novizon Jamaan at the IAF Directorate of Communication and 
Electronics on October 3.  Colonel Novizon confirmed that Sarigema 
has been a registered IAF supplier for more than ten years.  Novizon 
also confirmed that his office placed the order with Sarigema for 
components detailed in Ref A in July 2007 for installation on their 
F-5 aircraft. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Sarigema was the subject of a Blue Lantern check in 2004. 
On November 5, 2004, we visited Sarigema and met with the company's 
Director Rachmat Tedjapranata, for site visit and transaction 
verification (Ref B).  Tedjapranata informed us that PT. Sarigema 
Dinamika began operating in 1990 and has had a relationship with Sun 
Aviation for the past 14 years.  PT Sarigema Dinamika has both 
government and commercial customers and is an importer of aviation, 
communication, navigation and radar equipment, products and parts. 
The company lists several U.S. suppliers in its company profile, 
including Aircrafters Inc., Aero Technology Inc., Inair Aviation 
Service Inc., Jet International Inc. and Sun Aviation Inc.  In 
addition, the Government of Indonesia has licensed PT Sarigema 
Dinamika to repair equipment at its workshop facility in Jakarta. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Suryawijayati told us that there has been no change in 
ownership of PT. Sarigema Dinamika except for a minor rotation at 
the managerial level.  The company has 25 personnel and is located 
at the same address we visited three years ago: Jalan Daan Mogot 
No.119, Blok A-12, Jakarta Barat 11510, Indonesia, phone: +62 21 566 
9447 and fax: +62 21 560 4465.  Sarigema key officials include: 
 
-- Air Vice Marshall (RTD) Sutoyo, President Director.  Sutoyo has 
28 years of experience with the Indonesian Air Force as a pilot at 
the Air Force Academy and Operations. He is also former Director 
General for Air Transportation, Ministry of Transportation; 
 
-- Rachmat Tedjapranata, Marketing Director.  Tedjapranata has 
experience as an electrical engineer for 29 years, specializing in 
communication and avionics product marketing;

working for Dirgantara Indonesia, a state owned aircraft 
manufacturer;

¶6. (SBU) Comment: After verification with both Sarigema and the 
Indonesian Air Force's Directorate of Communication and Electronics, 
our assessment is that this transaction is legitimate.
