STILL WAITING TO DEPLOY 
 
REF: JAKARTA 864 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The planned deployment of one Formed 
Police Unit of Indonesian National Police to Darfur is on 
hold.  The unit is reportedly ready for deployment but 
bureaucratic issues must be addressed before the 140-strong 
unit can depart for Darfur.  It is estimated that the unit 
will not arrive in Darfur until September at the earliest. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) VISA PROBLEMS SLOW CAMP CONSTRUCTION:  On June 17, 
Fikry Cassidy, Deputy Director for International Security at 
the Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU), told poloff 
several hurdles needed to be overcome before the Indonesian 
National Police (INP) could deploy a 140-member Formed Police 
Unit (FPU) to Darfur.  Cassidy said the government of 
Indonesia (GOI) and the UN were still working to agree on a 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to clarify the role and 
responsibility of each organization participating in UNAMID. 
He thought the MOU would be signed soon.  However, the 
Sudanese government had yet to issue work visas to the 
construction crew of the Turkish contractor hired to erect 
the FPU base camp in Darfur.  The 10-member advance team from 
the Indonesian FPU had also experienced visa problems, but 
three were now in Darfur.  The other seven were in Indonesia, 
with visas but awaiting the arrival of the construction crew 
in Darfur so that the Indonesian advance team could arrive to 
supervise the construction of its FPU camp. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) SUPPORT AND SUPPLY ODYSSEY:  Cassidy said the 
Indonesian FPU was unlikely to deploy to Darfur until 
mid-September.  The unit's equipment and supplies were 
currently at the Port of Sudan (located on the Red Sea), but 
the overland transport from Port Sudan to Darfur 
(approximately 2,100 miles) would take three months. 
Equipment and supplies and a functioning base camp had to be 
in place before the FPU could depart. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  LATEST IN A SERIES OF DELAYS:  The INP had planned 
to send the first tranche of it's FPU to Darfur in October 
¶2007.  That plan was delayed when the African Union troops 
were ambushed in late September.  After reviewing the 
security situation in the region, President Yudhoyono signed 
a Presidential Decree on February 6, 2008 giving permission 
for the FPU to deploy in March.  GOI budgetary constraints 
then delayed the deployment to late May.
