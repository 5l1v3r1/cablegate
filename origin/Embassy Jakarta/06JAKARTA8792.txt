SUBJECT: INDONESIAN PARTICIPANTS FOR APEC SEMINAR ON 
PANDEMIC EXERCISES 
 
REF: State 111495 
 
¶1.  This is an action request; see para 3. 
 
¶2.  Three different Government of Indonesia (GOI) agencies 
are deeply involved in the control of avian influenza (AI). 
The National Committee on Avian Influenza (KOMNAS) serves as 
the national coordinating entity.  The Ministry of Health is 
the agency responsible for disease control in the human 
population, while the Ministry of Agriculture is responsible 
for disease control in the animal population.  All three 
need capacity building and would benefit from exposure to 
APEC member economies' AI control plans in the August 16-17 
Singapore seminar on Pandemic Exercises. 
 
¶3.  We accordingly recommend that the U.S. fund a 
representative from KOMNAS, as well GOI experts familiar 
with both the human and animal sides of AI to participate in 
the seminar.  We recommend the following individuals: 
 
Dr. Bayu Krisnamutki 
Executive Secretary for the National Committee on Avian 
Influenza Management and Pandemic Alert 
Coordinating Ministry for Economy 
Jl. Lapangan Banteng Timur No. 2-4, 6th Floor 
Phone: 62 21 352-1941 
Fax: 62 21 352-1909 
 
Dr. Tri Satya Putri Naipospos 
Secretary to the National Committee on Avian Influenza 
 
SIPDIS 
Management and Pandemic Alert 
Coordinating Ministry for Economy 
Jl. Lapangan Banteng Timur No. 2-4, 6th Floor 
Phone: 62 21 352 1941 
Fax: 62 21 352 1909 
Note: Naipospos was our top interlocutor in the Ministry of 
Agriculture until late 2005 and retains close relationships 
with key Ministry staffers. 
 
Dr. I. Nyoman Kandun 
Director General for Diseases Control and Environmental 
Health 
Ministry of Health 
Jl. Percetakan Negara No. 29 
Phone: 62 21 420-9930 
Fax:  62 21 420-7807 
 
¶4. We note that August 17 is Indonesian Independence Day and 
the start of a five-day weekend for many Indonesians.  This 
may make it difficult to recruit a GOI delegation for the 
seminar.  We will nonetheless strongly encourage Indonesian 
representation.
