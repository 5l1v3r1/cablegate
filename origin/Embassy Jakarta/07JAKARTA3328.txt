REF: STATE 161591 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Reftel points were passed on December 6 to Deputy 
Director for Terrorism and UN Sanctions Aris Munandar at 
Indonesia's Foreign Ministry.  Munandar said he would consult 
with colleagues and give us any comments.  Munandar also 
noted that his Directorate for International Security & 
Disarmament Affairs is currently woefully understaffed, with 
only six of the normal 14 staff working, others having 
rotated abroad.  The timing of replacements is still 
uncertain, Munandar said.
