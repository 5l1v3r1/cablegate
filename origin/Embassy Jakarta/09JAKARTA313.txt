¶2.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  Poloff urged Indonesia to support U.S. 
candidate Judge Mark P. Painter when the UN General Assembly 
voted on candidates for the UN Appeals Tribunal.  Our 
contacts promised to consider Painter's candidacy but added 
that Indonesia would not announce its intentions before the 
vote.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Per reftel instructions, Poloff raised the upcoming 
election for the UN Appeals Tribunal (UNAT) with Cicilia 
Rusdiharini, Deputy Director for North American Affairs at 
the Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU).  Poloff noted that 
the UNAT was an important element of UN reform.  He 
underscored that Painter would bring extensive legal 
experience and expertise to the UNAT and urged Indonesia to 
support him in the upcoming vote. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Rusdiharini said Indonesia would consider Painter's 
candidacy.  GOI officials would review the CV that we 
provided.  She noted, however, that Indonesia did not 
normally announce how it planned to vote in advance of UN 
personnel elections such as this.
