8.(SBU)  Hatta Rajsa, State Secretary of the United Indonesia 
Cabinet, expressed gratitude for a U.S. military field hospital and 
the USS Denver's airlift support.  He said imagery from P-3 flights 
would help the government's damage assessment and inquired about 
heavy equipment for excavation and well drilling.  Helicopter 
airlift capacity will get humanitarian assistance and maybe heavy 
equipment to hard to access areas.

(Swiss) medical aid and rescue team; Turkey humanitarian aid; Church

international NGOs working in the area.
