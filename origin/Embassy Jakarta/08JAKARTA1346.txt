REF: JAKARTA 1242 
 
Classified By: Pol/C Joseph L. Novak, reasons 1.4 (b+d). 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  During his July 11-12 visit to Jakarta, 
Brazilian President da Silva signed cooperation agreements on 
biofuels development and education.  President Yudhoyono also 
endorsed Lula's call for expansion of the UN Security Council 
and seemed to voice outright support for Brazil's candidacy 
for a permanent UNSC seat.  Brazil is generally off the scope 
for Indonesians, but an adviser to President Yudhoyono told 
us that the GOI was keen to welcome Lula, who is seen as an 
ally on many North-South issues.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SIGNING SEVERAL ACCORDS 
 
¶2.  (U) Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva visited 
Indonesia, July 11-12.  He met President Yudhoyono, House of 
Representatives (DPR) Speaker Agung Laksono, and People's 
Consultative Assembly Chair--and possible vice-presidential 
candidate--Hidayat Nur Wahid.  Lula arrived in Jakarta after 
his visit to Japan for G-8-related meetings and a one-day 
visit to Timor-Leste, another former Portugese colony. 
Yudhoyono announced that he would accept Lula's invitation to 
visit Brazil by the end of 2008. 
 
¶3.  (U) During the visit, Brazil and Indonesia signed a 
number of cooperation agreements on the environmental front. 
They agreed to work together on research and development of 
ethanol.  The two countries also signed an education 
cooperation agreement that will send Indonesian students to 
Brazil to study agriculture and alternative energy.  Finally, 
the two leaders pledged to work together to prevent 
deforestation. 
 
DISCUSSING UN REFORM 
 
¶4.  (U) As expected, the perennial topic of United Nations 
reform came up during the visit.  The UN system must be 
reformed to accommodate the contemporary global situation, 
Yudhoyono told reporters after meeting with Lula.  He agreed 
with Lula's call for expansion of the UN Security Council's 
permanent membership and indicated that Indonesia would 
support Brazil's candidacy for a permanent seat.  Yudhoyono 
also suggested that Indonesia--as the world's most populous 
Muslim country--would seek permanent membership in a reformed 
UNSC. 
 
¶5.  (C) Indonesia's Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) 
later seemed to walk back from the President's 
forward-leaning statements on the UNSC.  According to our 
contact, the GOI supports UNSC reform but--Yudhoyono's 
comments notwithstanding--has not actually decided whether it 
supports expanding the number of permanent UNSC members. 
According to Fikry Cassidy, Deputy Director of DEPLU's 
Directorate for International Security and Disarmament 
Affairs--the GOI office that handles UNSC affairs, the GOI 
has not decided whether to support any state's candidacy for 
a new permanent seat nor has it decided whether to put itself 
forward for such a seat.  Cassidy said DEPLU would seek 
clarification of SBY's remarks but added that Indonesia's 
position on the UNSC has not changed as far as he knows. 
 
BRAZIL SEEN AS A FRIEND 
 
¶6.  (C) Given the tyranny of distance, Brazil is generally 
off the scope for Indonesians.  That said, an adviser to 
President Yudhoyono told us that the Brazilian government is 
seen an ally on North-South issues.  Brazil is also seen as a 
growing world power that has effectively dealt with energy 
issues while improving its economy, factors which make it 
increasingly important to Indonesia.  The GOI welcomed Lula 
in that positive spirit.
