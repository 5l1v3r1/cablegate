¶2. Purwanto said he would need to study the text of the 
resolution before being able to comment on its substance, but 
noted that the creation of a peacekeeping force would give 
Indonesia an opportunity to contribute the battalion-sized 
force it had been preparing since announcing this intention 
on July 21.  (Note:  Previously the size of the force was 
around 700 persons.  In a conversation with us last week, 
Indonesian MOD Juwono Sudarsono put the size of the projected 
force at 850 persons.)
