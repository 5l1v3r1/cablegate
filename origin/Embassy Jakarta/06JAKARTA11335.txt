SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR JIATF WEST FY07 COUNTERDRUG SUPPORT TO 
INDONESIA 
 
¶1. This is a U.S. Embassy Jakarta, DEA, ICE, and ICITAP 
coordinated request for U.S. Defense Department operational 
support under Section 1004, National Defense Authorization 
Act of 1991 as amended, for JIATF West support to 
Indonesian law enforcement agencies. 
 
¶2. The DEA, ICE and ICITAP have identified the following 
areas in which the government of Indonesia (GOI) would 
benefit from FY07 JIATF West counterdrug support: 
 
¶A. Interagency cooperation and information sharing: 
     - Additional outstation to the Joint Interagency 
Counterdrug Operations Center. 
     - Assistance implementing the Passenger Analysis Unit 
at Jakarta International Airport. 
     - Analytic support to U.S. DEA. 
¶B. Marijuana eradication: 
     - Two Baker Iron counterdrug training missions. 
     - Infrastructure support for Baker Iron training. 
¶C. Maritime drug interdiction: 
     - Two Fusion Iron counterdrug training missions. 
     - Infrastructure support for Fusion Iron training 
 
Interagency Cooperation and Information Sharing 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶3. Post recognizes that the JIATF West supported Joint 
Interagency Counterdrug Operations Center (JIACDOC) in 
Jakarta has enhanced Indonesian civilian law enforcement 
capabilities in the areas of counterdrug intelligence 
gathering, coordination and sharing.  This was evident 
during the successful seizure of Cikande clandestine drug 
lab in November of 2005.  Post requests a maritime port 
facility, as an outstation in the JIACDOC network, be 
established in the Sulawesi Sea region.  In addition to 
coordinating the implementation of the JIACDOC outstations 
with DEA, Post requests that JIATF West coordinate with the 
Office of Defense Cooperation regarding linkage of JIACDOC 
network to the Integrated Maritime Surveillance System 
initiative where applicable. 
 
¶4. Post requests continued JIATF West assistance to DHS/ICE 
with the implementation and operation of the Passenger 
Analysis Unit (PAU) located at the Jakarta International 
Airport. 
 
Marijuana Eradication 
--------------------- 
¶5. Post requests continued enhancement of Indonesian 
civilian law enforcement capabilities and needs in the area 
of marijuana eradication.  During FY05, Indonesian National 
Police (INP) and the Indonesian National Narcotics Board 
(BNN) formed specialized Marijuana Eradication Task Forces 
to address illegal marijuana cultivation within Indonesia. 
These Task Forces received basic marijuana eradication 
training from U.S. DEA and JIATF West in FY06, and based on 
meetings between the U.S. DEA, the INP and the BNN, this 
training was extremely beneficial to Task Force operations. 
As illegal marijuana cultivation continues to be a problem, 
and a high priority for the INP, the following FY07 support 
is requested to enhance the GOI,s marijuana eradication 
efforts: Two ground oriented training missions (Baker 
Training, to include fire arms training) to support the 
Marijuana Eradication Task Force.  Post requests JIATF West 
coordinate location of these training events with U.S. DEA. 
 
Maritime Drug Interdiction 
-------------------------- 
¶6. FY06 was the inaugural year for JIATF West training 
support to ICITAP and Indonesian Marine Police.  Based upon 
meetings between ICITAP and Indonesian Marine Police, Post 
believes that this training was beneficial to marine 
security, and that the requirement exists for continued 
training support.  ICITAP and Post believe that this 
support will aid in creating a more professional maritime 
interdiction force.  Therefore, Post requests the following 
maritime drug interdiction support for FY07: Two maritime 
 
JAKARTA 00011335  002 OF 002 
 
 
oriented training missions (Fusion Training, to include 
fire arms training) to support Indonesian Marine Police. 
Post requests JIATF West coordinate location of these 
training events with ICITAP to complement ICITAP,s Marine 
Police Assistance Project. 
 
Other Issues 
------------ 
¶7. Infrastructure Support for Training Programs: Training 
sites for the Baker/Fusion program will benefit from 
infrastructure renovation.  Accordingly, Post requests 
JIATF West assistance to renovate select maritime training 
infrastructure (in support of Fusion Training) in the 
Sulawesi Sea region and renovate select ground based 
training infrastructure (in support of Baker Training) in 
Sumatra.  Post requests JIATF West coordinate maritime 
training infrastructure support with ICITAP and ground 
based training infrastructure support with DEA. 
 
¶8. Analytic support to U.S. Law Enforcement Agencies:  DEA 
Singapore investigates U.S. and foreign nationals involved 
in drug trafficking activities linked to Indonesia, 
Singapore, and East Timor.  Post believes that JIATF West 
analytic support to DEA will help exploit links to 
transnational criminal organizations, and bolster the 
collection process.  Post requests JIATF West continue 
analytic support with temporary deployments of an 
intelligence analyst in support of DEA. 
 
¶9. The DEA office in Singapore works closely with all of 
the Indonesian counterdrug law enforcement agencies.  DEA 
(MR. Russ Holske) will be the POC for JIATF West JIACDOC 
and ground based training/infrastructure support.  The 
ICITAP Senior Law Enforcement Advisor (Mr. Gerald Heuett) 
is the POC for JIATF West maritime training/maritime 
training infrastructure support.  The DHS/ICE Singapore 
(Mr. Matt King) is POC for support to the Passenger 
Analysis Unit and all other immigration and customs 
activities.  All JIATF West activities must be conducted in 
close coordination with the above POCs and Post's Law 
Enforcement Working Group. 
 
¶10. Post appreciates JIATF West,s action providing the 
requested support, which directly enhances U.S. and 
Indonesian efforts to fight transnational crime and illegal 
narcotics trafficking.
