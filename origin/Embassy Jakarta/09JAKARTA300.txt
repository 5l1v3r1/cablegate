¶1. (SBU) On February 20, we delivered the draft S&T agreement during 
a meeting with Ministry of Research and Technology (MENRISTEK) and 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials.  A MENRISTEK official noted 
that Minister Kusmayanto Kadiman is anxious to conclude the S & T 
agreement prior to Presidential elections, as he would like to 
ensure this MOU is part of his legacy.  MENRISTEK plans to convene 
an interagency review of the document during the week of February 
¶23.
