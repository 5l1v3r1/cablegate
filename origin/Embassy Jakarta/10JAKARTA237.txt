BECOME MINISTRIES 
 
¶1.  (U) In late 2009 President Yudhoyono signed Presidential 
Regulation No 47 that formally transformed GOI Cabinet 
departments into ministries.  Ministries have begun slowly 
implementing the new regulation since the start of 2010. 
Under the new regulation the Department of Foreign Affairs 
has become the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Department of 
Defense is now the Ministry of Defense, Department of Trade 
the Ministry of Trade, and so on.  The change comes despite 
the fact that for many decades the head of each department 
has held the title minister. 
 
¶2.  (U) The change also brings a new set of shortened names 
by which most Indonesians--and Indonesia watchers--know the 
ministries.  For example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' 
well-known moniker DEPLU has become KEMLU, the Ministry of 
Defense goes from DEPHAN to KEMHAN and the Ministry of Trade 
becomes KEMENDAG.  Some entities retain the old versions of 
their short names--the Ministry of National Development 
Planning is still BAPPENAS.  Others have given up entirely on 
something pronounceable, such as KPP--otherwise known as the 
Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. (Note:  Mission has sent 
the full list of new names to EAP/MTS via email.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Officials are at a loss to explain what the new 
names mean.  "I guess I'll have to get new cards printed," 
one KEMLU official told us when pressed to explain the 
significance of the Ministry's new name.  Several officials 
told us that the name change does not reflect any change in 
the ministries' relative positions or roles in the Cabinet. 
Nor does it presage any internal reorganization or 
restructuring of the bureaucracy.
