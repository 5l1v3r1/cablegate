U.S. House of Representatives 
Washington, D.C. 
 
Dear Congressman Price and Congressman Dreier, 
 
Congratulations to your successful re-election campaigns.  As 
you are all aware, Indonesian voters are now in the process 
of deciding who they would like to represent them for the 
next Parliamentarians Session as well. 
 
As you are aware, the Indonesian Parliament is fully 
committed to enhancing its functions on legislation, 
conducting oversight and developing our national budget by 
doing so in an open and accountable manner.  My colleagues 
and I view activities under the auspices of the Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) between our two parliaments as an 
important means by which we can achieve our goals. 
 
In line with the MOU, I would like to inform you that the 
Special Committee on Institutional Composition and Status of 
the Indonesian House of Representatives, People's 
Consultative Assembly, Regional Representatives Council and 
Regional Legislative Assembly, is sending its delegation to 
the United States to study specific Congressional 
Institutions and practices.  This Committee is in the final 
stages of developing legislation that requires broad reforms 
for our parliamentary institutions and practices.  The 
Committee has studied the practices of other parliaments and 
has last minute questions concerning some of the these from 
the U.S. experience.  The Leadership and members of the 
Committee are interested in having specific discussions about 
the operation of your Congressional Budget Office, 
Congressional Research Office, Office of the Legislative 
Council, development of your operating budget and internal 
administration of the House itself. 
 
The delegation consists of 11 (eleven) Members, including the 
Head of the delegation, and 2 (two) secretaries.  We are in 
the process of soliciting assistance from our Embassy in 
Washington as well.  We hope they will provide interpretation 
services as well.  We suggest the meeting dates be conducted 
from January 26th, 27th and possibly 28th.  I recognize this 
period is an especially busy time in Washington but I hope 
your schedules can accommodate this delegation. 
 
We appreciate the leadership of both of you have provided 
through the HDAC and look forward to meeting you again. 
 
Yours Sincerely, 
 
/S/ 
 
H.R. Agung Laksono
