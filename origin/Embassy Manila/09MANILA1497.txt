(SBU)  Ambassador took advantage of a previously scheduled 
July 10 meeting with Philippine Foreign Secretary Alberto 
Romulo to raise reftel points regarding the July 6-8 meetings 
in Moscow between President Obama and President Medvedev. 
The Ambassador noted the summit had ended a period of drift 
in U.S.-Russian relations, and paved the way for future 
cooperation on arms reduction, nuclear nonproliferation, 
Afghanistan, and a number of other areas.  The Ambassador 
reinforced the importance of the recent summit by outlining 
how the two presidents had signed an agreement that would 
enable U.S. transit of Russian airspace in resupplying 
coalition forces in Afghanistan, and how a follow-on 
agreement had been facilitated for the soon-to-expire START 
treaty.  Romulo responded with enthusiasm, underscoring how, 
given the necessity for greater engagement of the 
international community on troubling regional issues such as 
North Korea and Burma, a more open and cooperative dialogue 
between two great world powers such as the U.S. and Russia 
could only bode well for the future.
