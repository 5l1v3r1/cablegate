Â¶1. EconOff delivered reftel points to Philippine Department of 
Foreign Affairs Director Maria Lourdes Salcedo on April 29.  Salcedo 
was receptive to the U.S. position of forging a stand-alone 
agreement to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, 
and sent an urgent fax to the Philippine Agricultural Attache in 
Rome.  She commented that she would need to consult with the Bureau 
of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, also.  Both Salcedo and EconOff 
called and emailed the Bureau Director several times, and neither 
have received a response, as yet.  Salcedo sent a second fax to 
Rome, but has not yet received feedback from the Attache.  Salcedo 
promised to inform EconOff if she hears from either the Attache or 
Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Director.
