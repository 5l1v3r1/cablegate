REF: SECSTATE 74879 
 
Â¶1. (SBU)  Post on July 14 conveyed to the Philippine 
Department of Foreign Affairs' Legal, Political and Security 
Affairs Director for United Nations and Other International 
Organizations (UNIO) Leah Ruiz our concerns with Iran's 
anticipated maneuvering at the upcoming Non-Aligned Movement 
(NAM) Ministerial meeting to be held July 27-30 in Tehran 
(reftel).  Ruiz stated that the Philippines, as a member of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors 
(IAEA/BOG), was conscious of the fact that Iran has not 
provided the cooperation or transparency necessary to address 
the IAEA's concerns with Iran's nuclear program.  Ruiz 
further added that she was "quite aware of what Iran is 
trying to do" with respect to creating the appearance of 
consensus about what it calls its "peaceful nuclear program". 
 Ruiz stated that the Philippine government, "probably more 
than others, shares your concern" that the NAM Foreign 
Minister's statement should reflect the reality of 
international concerns with Iran's nuclear program, but 
acknowledged that the Philippine government adopts the 
approach that it must balance its commitments to the 
international fora where it plays an important role, 
including the NAM and IAEA/BOG, which are often at 
loggerheads.  In an unrelated July 8 conversation, UNIO 
Special Assistant Querobine Deapera told poloff that she was 
reviewing the proposed Iranian statement for the NAM 
Ministerial meeting and that her job, at the working level, 
was to highlight the numerous references to the Iran's 
"peaceful" nuclear program that concerned the DFA.
