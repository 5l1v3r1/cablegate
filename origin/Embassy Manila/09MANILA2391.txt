SUBJECT: KIDNAPPERS RELEASE IRISH PRIEST AFTER ONE MONTH OF 
CAPTIVITY 
 
REF: A. MANILA 2220 (IRISH PRIEST IS LATEST FOREIGNER 
        KIDNAPPED IN MINDANAO) 
     ¶B. MANILA 2198 (CHARGE DISCUSSES PEACE PROSPECTS) 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Kristie A. Kenney, for reasons 1.4 (B) & (D) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Irish priest Michael Sinnott was released by 
his kidnappers in the early morning hours of November 12, one 
month after his abduction in Pagadian City in the southern 
island of Mindanao.  While no group has claimed 
responsibility for the kidnapping, Philippine prosecutors 
have filed charges against as yet unnamed "rogue" members of 
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).  The mainstream 
MILF command denies that any of its members were involved in 
the abduction and noted that Philippine officials have 
publicly credited an MILF Task Force for assisting in the 
peaceful release of Sinnott.  A top Philippine official 
responsible for the government-MILF peace process told us he 
had intervened with the MILF to push for Sinnott's release, 
telling the MILF the peace process was at stake; he believed 
the MILF did not release Sinnott immediately upon receiving 
him from his captors.  While the complete circumstances of 
the priest's release remain unclear, Philippine officials 
expressed their doubts that any ransom was paid.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) Michael Sinnott, a 79 year-old Colombian missionary, 
was released by his kidnappers in the early morning hours of 
November 12.  He had been abducted on October 11 (Ref A).  At 
the time of his kidnapping, Philippine authorities speculated 
that a local commander with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front 
(MILF) was behind the kidnapping, an allegation which MILF 
officials strongly denied.  In an October 16 meeting with 
MILF leader Murad Ibrahim, the DCM urged the MILF to do all 
it could to help secure Father Sinnott's rapid release (Ref 
B).  The DCM relayed to Murad the extreme concern of the 
Irish Ambassador regarding Father Sinnott's ill health and 
need for heart medication.  She stressed that the MILF had a 
role to play in helping the situation and preventing 
terrorist and kidnap-for-ransom groups from exploiting the 
lack of security. 
 
¶3. (U) During a press conference at a Philippine Air Force 
Base in Manila soon after his release, Father Sinnott, who is 
affectionately known as "Father Mike" by his parishioners, 
appeared in good spirits and thanked those who prayed for him 
during his ordeal.  In fluent Tagalog, Father Sinnott said 
that, despite his recent ordeal, his commitment to the 
Mindanao people remained strong and expressed his wish to 
return to his rectory in Pagadian City.  He also said he 
believed that he was not kidnapped by the MILF, but rather 
"members of a lost command led by a certain 'Pikay.'"  At the 
same press conference, senior Philippine military and 
government officials said they doubted any ransom was paid 
for his release.  They also publicly credited an MILF Task 
Force for its assistance in the safe release of Father 
Sinnott. 
 
¶4. (C) In a November 13 conversation, Department of Foreign 
Affairs Undersecretary Rafael Seguis, Chairman of the 
Philippines, Peace Panel, told the Embassy he had personally 
interceded with the MILF on November 10 to secure the release 
of Sinnott, and that the priest had been released to him in 
the city of Zamboanga.  Seguis said he believed the MILF had 
secured custody of Sinnott from his kidnappers on November 9 
or 10, but had not immediately released him.  U/S Seguis said 
he had reluctantly become involved in this matter because of 
the extreme importance the Philippines government attached to 
Sinnott,s case.  Seguis told the MILF the peace process was 
at stake -- it would be impossible to proceed with peace 
talks if it appeared the MILF bore responsibility for the 
kidnapping.  When U/S Seguis spoke to Embassy officials after 
Sinnott,s release, he refrained from speculating about the 
extent of MILF responsibility for the kidnapping, saying he 
hoped to have no further involvement in investigating the 
abduction; the peace process should remain separate from such 
issues.  Seguis also added that he believed the MILF would 
never cooperate with law enforcement efforts in targeting the 
kidnappers. 
 
¶5. (C) COMMENT: The details of who kidnapped Father Sinnott 
and how he was released remain murky.  Having filed charges 
against "rogue" MILF members, the Philippine government will 
have a chance to make its case.  The kidnapping and 
allegations of MILF involvement come at a sensitive time in 
the ongoing peace negotiations.  Philippine officials are 
expected to travel to Kuala Lumpur for further informal talks 
with the MILF on November 16, and both sides have privately 
confided to the Ambassador that they are currently expediting 
their efforts to conclude a peace agreement before the June
