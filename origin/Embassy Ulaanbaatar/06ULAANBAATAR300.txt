¶1.  (SBU) Poloff met on April 21 with MFA Acting 
Director for Policy Planning T. Janabazar.  Poloff 
asked about a press report (ref a) that stated that 
Mongolia, along with Iran, India, and Pakistan, would 
soon become Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) 
members.  Janabazar categorically stated that Mongolia 
has no intentions of even applying for SCO membership, 
and is very comfortable remaining an observer.  He said 
he has seen press reports speculating on new SCO 
members.  He stated he had information from Mongolia's 
mission in New Delhi that India had not applied for 
membership.  However, he said, Pakistan has.  He had no 
information on Iran. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Janabazar noted that the SCO is drawing up a 
charter more clearly defining what the position and 
prerogatives of an SCO "observer" are.  The draft 
charter had been expected to be circulated at the end 
of last month, but internal differences among the 
members have delayed it until the end of this month. 
While Janabazar said that Mongolia has not seen the 
draft, he said his government's understanding and 
expectation is that the defined "observer" status will 
allow Mongolia to participate in all activities it 
wants to, including economic integration, anti- 
terrorism, anti-money laundering, etc.  He said 
Mongolia will look closely at the final document, but 
reiterated that his government had decided that it does 
not wish to apply for membership. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Asked why his government had decided just to 
remain an observer, Janabazar did not reply directly, 
but noted that Mongolia newspapers often carry a 
variety of speculation about the organization, and the 
machinations of existing member states.  He commented 
that as he is new (he has only been in his current 
position two weeks), he does not have any personal feel 
for whether there are in reality any such machinations. 
After attending the SCO summit in June, he laughed, he 
might be able to offer an opinion. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Janabazar confirmed that President Enkhbayar 
has accepted an invitation to attend the SCO summit in 
Shanghai June 14-15.  Janabazar noted that this is to 
be a special summit, since it is the 10th anniversary 
of the "Shanghai Five."  (Note: The July 2005 SCO 
summit was Enkhbayar's first foreign trip after his 
June 23 inauguration; officials noted then it provided 
a convenient way for Enkhbayar to meet other leaders, 
including Putin and Hu Jintao (ref b).  Enkhbayar made 
a bilateral visit to China in November 2005, stopping 
then in Shanghai as well as Beijing.) 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment: It is possible Mongolia may 
reevaluate its strong position against membership if 
the newly-defined observer status precludes 
participation in some activities it wishes to join, 
especially economic ones.  However, it will strongly 
prefer to remain a member because of its own concerns 
about being caught in the Big Power politics of Russia 
and China (especially the latter) -- and because 
Mongolian leaders will not want to deal with the likely 
fallout of domestic allegations that becoming a 
"member" is evidence Mongolia is falling into China's 
orbit.
