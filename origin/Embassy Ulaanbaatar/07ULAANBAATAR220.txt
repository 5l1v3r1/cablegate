¶1.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided the Embassy with the 
copy of a letter from President Enkhbayar to President Bush.  MFA 
stated that, while the letter is dated March 30, it was delivered by 
the Mongolian Embassy in Washington on April 11.  The letter was 
released to the Mongolian press on April 11, and newspapers 
published the contents of the letter on April 12.  MFA's English 
language translation of the letter is in para 2. 
 
¶2.  Begin MFA translation of the letter: 
 
Dear Mr. President, 
 
It was a great pleasure to talk to you on the telephone and exchange 
views on several issues of bilateral cooperation. 
 
It gives me a pleasure to inform you, Mr. President, that the issues 
on which we exchanged views, are begun to be materialized. The 
Government of Mongolia has decided, at the recommendation of the 
National Security Council, to extend the term of the service of the 
7th rotation team of the Mongolian armed forces in Iraq, until early 
July 2007. As you might know, taking this decision was not easy one 
for us given the situation in Iraq, the public attitude and the 
positions of some of the countries in the region and beyond. 
 
Taking this opportunity I wish to draw, once again, your kind 
attention to some of the issues that were raised during our 
conversation. 
 
Concluding MCA Compact Agreement between our two countries is 
becoming for us an issue of principle.   The Mongolian public is 
becoming anxious over the fact that Mongolia has not been able to 
receive assistance from the Millennium Challenge Account in spite of 
being eligible to receive assistance four years in row. It is, 
therefore, highly desirable for us to decide, as soon as possible, 
on the issue of concluding Compact Agreement.  I, therefore, request 
You, Mr. President, to pay your kind attention to this issue and 
provide a political support to it. 
 
Given the importance of specialists with higher education for the 
strengthening of democracy and ensuring sustainable economic 
development of Mongolia, I requested, during our conversation, to 
support increasing scholarship opportunities for the Mongolian youth 
in United States higher education institutions. I would be most 
grateful, in this connection, if your administration could initiate 
Scholarships program for Mongolian young people, just the way a 
scholarships program is being implemented by your administration for 
Central Asia and Afghanistan. 
 
In 2001 our country granted to the United States citizens the right 
to visit Mongolia without visa up to 90 days. We would be most 
grateful if the United States could reciprocate this commitment of 
ours. 
 
I am confident that Mongolia and the United States will continue to 
fruitfully cooperate on the above and other issues, like Mongolia's 
APEC membership, including the Mongolians in the United States in a 
guest - worker program, Iraq's stabilization and rehabilitation, and 
de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
 
In conclusion, I wish to thank you, Mr. President, for your kind 
invitation for me to visit the United States at the time of my 
convenience. It is my earnest hope that an opportunity will be 
bestowed on me to pay a fruitful visit to your magnificent country 
in order to continue with you our joint efforts to further enhance 
the close and comprehensive partnership between our two countries. 
 
Please accept, Dear Mr. President, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
 
PRESIDENT OF MONGOLIA
