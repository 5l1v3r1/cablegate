¶1. (SBU) On June 26, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Americas, Middle 
East and Africa Director General Jambaldorj confirmed to the 
Ambassador that the Cabinet had earlier that day approved an 8th 
rotation of troops to Iraq.  Foreign Policy Advisor to the President 
Tsogtbaatar and Foreign Policy Advisor to the Prime Minister 
 
SIPDIS 
Davaasuren separately confirmed this to the DCM as well.  Earlier in 
the day, Ministry of Defense sources told the DATT that Mongolian 
Armed Forces Chief of Staff LTG Togoo would go before the Cabinet in 
the afternoon to personally argue for sending the detachment.  The 
136 troops will depart early on June 30 by chartered flight for 
Kuwait en route to Iraq.  The Ambassador plans to see them off at 
the airport that day. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  COMMENT:  The March POTUS phone call to President 
Enkhbayar was pivotal in terms of nudging the National Security 
Council (President, Prime Minister, and Speaker) to recommend 
approval of the 8th rotation to the Cabinet.  Achieving this 
important goal of continuing Mongolia's troop participation in Iraq 
required heavy lobbying of Mongolian officials at all levels here, 
most recently by EAP A/S Hill, as well as in Washington.  Mongolia 
has been a faithful ally in Iraq and Afghanistan in part because we 
have maintained a strong, cooperative military-to-military 
relationship.
