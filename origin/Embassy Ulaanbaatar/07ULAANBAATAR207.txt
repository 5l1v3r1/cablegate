SUBJECT: THANKS FOR ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ VISIT OF MONGOLIAN 
DEFENSE MINISTER 
 
REF: USDAO ULAANBAATAR IIR 050808Z APR 07 
 
¶1.  I want to express my personal thanks to the U.S. military 
and State Department personnel who assisted in the March 
27-28 visit to Iraq of Mongolian Defense Minister Sonompil to 
meet with Mongolian troops and make a personal assessment of 
the conditions in Iraq.  I met with the Minister on April 4 
(reftel) and, while the political leadership must endorse 
this, the Defense Minister's visit appears to have set the 
stage for a continued Mongolian presence in Iraq.  Thus, the 
visit was a very successful follow-up to President Bush's 
phone call to his Mongolian counterpart on March 5, when the 
Mongolian troops were days away from ending their force 
protection role and departing Iraq. 
 
¶2.  Support for the visit of any VIP can be taxing at the 
best of times, much less supporting a smooth visit to a war 
zone.  This visit also had its hiccups outside Iraq, and our 
colleagues in Kuwait and elsewhere in the Gulf worked hard to 
ensure that Defense Minister Sonompil's journey was 
facilitated.  He was very appreciative of your efforts.  Well 
done. 
 
¶3.  Some personnel we can cite by name, but there are many 
others that helped and share in the credit.  Those we know 
deserve special thanks include: 
 
MAJ Donald Kaufam 
Mr. DeWitt Conklin 
LTC Kenneth Cozzie 
CPT Richard Doering 
SFC Michael Eastham
