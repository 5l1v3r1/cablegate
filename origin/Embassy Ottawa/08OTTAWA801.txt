of Foreign Affairs and International Trade David Emerson on

¶2.  (U)  Begin text 
 
Canada congratulates the Somali Transitional Federal 
Government and the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia 
on concluding a peace agreement on June 9, 2008, in Djibouti. 
 This agreement is an important step in ending the tragic 
18-year civil war that has brought much suffering to the 
people of Somalia.  We recognize the efforts of Ahmedou 
Ould-Abdallah, UN Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General in West Africa, in convening the peace 
talks, and of the Government of Djibouti in hosting them. 
 
Canada calls on all parties in Somalia to support the peace 
agreement, end hostilities and work toward reconciliation. 
Canada is deeply concerned by the current humanitarian 
crisis, which has been exacerbated by the conflict.  There 
must be unhindered access within the country for humanitarian 
actors, and greater efforts are required to protect human 
rights and media freedom. 
 
Canada has contributed more than $25 million in humanitarian 
assistance since December 2006.  This includes $16 million to 
the World Food Programme and an additional $4.5 million to 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the 
International Committee of the Red Cross and Canadian 
non-governmental organizations.  Canada also provides 
$500,000 a year to support local projects in three priority 
areas:  good governance, democratic development and human 
rights.
