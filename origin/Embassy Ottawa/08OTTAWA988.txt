Â¶1.  (SBU) Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) Senior Advisor for Non-Proliferation Che van 
Haastrecht expressed appreciation for reftel U.S. initiative, 
and confirmed that Canadian firms would not sell uranium to 
any Iranian entities.  The Canadian government authorizes 
uranium shipments only to countries that have signed 
bilateral cooperative agreements, van Haastrecht said, and 
there is no such agreement with Iran.  Moreover, he added, 
long-standing vetted customers have "tied up" all of Canada's 
uranium output for many years to come.
