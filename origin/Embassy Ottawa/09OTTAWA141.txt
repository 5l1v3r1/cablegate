 ¶1.  (U)  Canadian Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon on 
February 26 confirmed that he would take part in the March 2 
"Conference in Support of the Palestinian Economy for the 
Reconstruction of Gaza" in Sharm al-Sheikh Egypt (reftels). 
He underscored that Canada had made a five year commitment 
beginning in 2006 worth C$300 million for assistance to the 
Palestinian people, as well as an additional C$4 million in 
January 2009 for pressing humanitarian needs in Gaza. 
 
¶2.  (U)  On the same trip, FM Cannon will separately meet 
with Jordanian, Israeli, Palestinian, and Egyptian leaders 
and ministers.  He expressed appreciation for the 
"constructive approach of key moderate states in the region, 
such as Jordan and Egypt."  He pledged "Canada's full 
support" for a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel 
and Palestine, while emphasizing that "Canada will support 
only those Palestinian leaders who understand that civil 
order and an end to terrorism are essential conditions for 
the fulfillment of Palestinian national ambitions."  He 
reiterated Canada's support for "Israel's right to protect 
its citizens and defend itself."
