¶1. (U) Summary:  Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper 
fine-tuned his Cabinet in a minor shuffle on June 25, bolstering 
representation from Quebec following the sudden resignation of 
former Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Bernier in May (reftel). 
Bernier's interim successor David Emerson won confirmation as 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, while Montreal Senator Michael Fortier 
was appointed to the International Trade portfolio.  Fellow Quebecer 
Christian Paradis was promoted to Public Works and Government 
Services Canada (PWGSC).  The shuffle emphasized continuity and 
signaled the government's commitment to build support in Quebec. 
End summary. 
 
THE GOVERNMENT IS "ON TRACK" 
 
¶2. (U) PM Harper shuffled his Cabinet for the third time since 
February 2006 in an 11:00 a.m. ceremony on June 25.  He declined to 
comment following the ceremony, except to reassure Canadians that 
his team was "on track and will stay on track."  Similarly, the 
three new appointees declined comment.  The Prime Minister's Office 
subsequently released a statement praising the "small but important 
changes" which would allow the government to build on its 
achievements, and deliver the "strong leadership Canadians expect 
and deserve."  Last week Harper said that his ministers were 
"hitting their stride" and that it was not the right time for a 
comprehensive overhaul.  The promotion of the two Quebec ministers 
was primarily designed to reassure Quebecers that the province 
retains its influence within the inner circle of power despite 
Bernier's departure. 
 
EMERSON CONFIRMED AS MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
 
¶3. (U) The shuffle confirmed the continued appointment of David 
Emerson as Minister of Foreign Affairs.  Emerson held the Foreign 
Affairs, International Trade, and Olympics portfolios on an interim 
basis since May.  Although many observers have noted that Harper has 
finally found a Foreign Minister with the intellectual heft and 
experience for the job, doubts persist over whether Emerson will run 
in the next election. 
 
A GOOD FIT FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
 
¶4. (U) Senator Michael Fortier, the former Minister of PWGSC, is an 
urbane former international business lawyer and investment banker 
with strong qualifications for the International Trade portfolio. 
He ran unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party and was later 
appointed to both the Senate and to Cabinet by Harper in February 
¶2006.  At first glance, Fortier's new post is less a clear promotion 
than a lateral move, although his personal closeness to Harper, and 
his political network in Quebec, make him an influential player in 
Cabinet. 
 
¶5. (U) As a Senator, Fortier is prohibited from speaking in the 
Commons.  Fortier was ably represented in the Commons as Minister of 
PWGSC by his previous Parliamentary Secretary, James Moore, whose 
bilingualism and deft performance largely compensated for his boss's 
absence.  International Trade is more high profile and publicly 
visible than PWGSC, however, and it is unclear whether the same 
stop-gap solution can work effectively for Fortier in his new 
portfolio.  Harper may choose to appoint a Parliamentary 
spokesperson to field trade-related questions in the Commons, or 
answer them himself. 
 
¶6. (U) When he entered Cabinet in 2006, Fortier committed to running 
in the next election in the Montreal (Quebec) riding of 
Vaudreuil-Solanges, but there has been speculation that he would 
QVaudreuil-Solanges, but there has been speculation that he would 
change his mind and leave public life entirely, or seek a more 
winnable riding.  Fortier has reportedly built a considerable 
organization in the riding, but the extensive travel required by his 
new portfolio could hamper his ability to spend time there 
politicking. 
 
BIG PROMOTION FOR RURAL QUEBEC 
 
¶7. (U) Christian Paradis, a French-Canadian rural MP little-known 
even in Quebec, was given the sprawling PWGSC portfolio, which 
handles procurement, sales and real estate for the federal 
government.  Although not in the first rank of Cabinet posts, PWGSC 
controls one of the largest budgets in the federal government.  Its 
contracting power -- and potential for distributing largesse -- 
should give the new minister a significant profile in Quebec. 
Unusually, Paradis also retained his previous junior ministerial 
 
OTTAWA 00000866  002 OF 002 
 
 
responsibility as Secretary of State for Agriculture (a major and 
politically sensitive industry in Quebec).  The bilingual Paradis 
will also continue to back-stop in French for the unilingual 
Anglophone Minister of Agriculture, Gerry Ritz. 
 
OLYMPICS, PACIFIC GATEWAY AND OFFICIAL LANGUAGES 
 
 
¶8. (U) The only new addition to the Ministry (but not the Cabinet) 
is British Columbia MP James Moore, previously Parliamentary 
Secretary for PWGSC.  As a new Secretary of State for Pacific 
Gateway, Vancouver-Whistler Olympics Official Languages, Moore 
receives a promotion. 
 
¶9. (U) Secretaries of State are junior ministers and are not members 
of Cabinet.  They do not attend Cabinet meetings, but attend 
meetings of appropriate Cabinet Committees in light of their 
responsibilities.  However, they are members of the Ministry (the 
executive branch) and of the Privy Council and are therefore bound 
by Cabinet solidarity and Cabinet confidence. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶10. (SBU) The minor scope of the shuffle reinforced the government's 
emphasis on continuity and Quebec.  Some observers continue to 
speculate that today's limited tweaking may be followed by a more 
comprehensive realignment in the late fall or winter if there is no 
election.  Harper has made it clear, however, that he is satisfied 
with his present team.  Any further changes in the next six months 
would likely send the unhelpful message that his team has fallen off 
track.  End comment.
