(SBU) 1.  Econoff provided talking points to specified Health 
Canada contact Christina Zehaluk on November 4, 2005.  Ms. 
Zehaluk said that the GOC would support a higher level for 
added nucleotides, and if 16mg/kcal was "the number on the 
table" she felt that the GOC could probably support that, 
based on current added levels in products for sale in Canada 
and the United States.  Ms. Zehaluk did mention, however, 
that she does not feel that this is the most important topic 
under consideration at the upcoming meeting, and she is 
suprised at the level of attention it is getting.
