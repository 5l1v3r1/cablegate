¶1. (sbu) Summary:  Canada shares many of the USG's priorities 
for APEC 2006, Foreign Affairs Canada APEC Deputy Director 
Karen Garner told EMIN on October 26.  Garner stated that 
Canada would urge APEC members to support an "ambitious, 
successful conclusion" to the Doha round, and said APEC 
reforms are needed to keep the organization vital and 
relevant.  Other Canadian priorities include an initiative 
with New Zealand on private sector development; APEC's 
Counterterrorism Task Force's work on rail and mass transit 
issues; and APEC,s Health Task Force,s action plan.  Garner 
also stated that Canada favors extending the moratorium on 
APEC membership expiration for another three years.  Prime 
Minister Stephen Harper, Foreign Minister Peter McKay, and 
International Trade Minister David Emerson all plan to travel 
to Hanoi.  Garner does not expect Harper will request a 
bilateral meeting with President Bush.  Garner also requested 
further details on USG's views regarding APEC,s Travel Card 
Initiative, whether Secretary Rice would seek a multilateral 
meeting with North Korea on the margins of APEC, how Thailand 
will be treated at APEC given that country's coup, and how to 
best pursue an Asia-Pacific FTA. End Summary 
 
Canadian Priorities 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (u) EMIN and ECONCOUNS delivered reftel points regarding 
USG priorities and unresolved initiatives for APEC 2006 to 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) 
Deputy Director for APEC Karen Garner on October 26.  Garner 
said there are "no surprises" in the USG priorities, which 
generally mirror the GOC's top goals.  She stated that Canada 
would urge APEC members to support an "ambitious, successful 
conclusion" to the Doha round, and that APEC reforms are 
needed to keep the organization vital and relevant.  However, 
she said, some APEC members (e.g., China, Malaysia) are 
putting up obstacles to reform efforts. 
 
¶3. (sbu) In other Canadian priority areas, Garner noted a 
Canadian-New Zealand initiative on private sector 
development, and said Canada would be seeking support for its 
multiyear work plan in this area.  Garner also stated that 
Canada wants to see progress regarding the Counterterrorism 
Task Force's work on rail and mass transit issues -- but 
commented that China is sensitive to discussing security 
issues in APEC given Taiwan,s presence and the PRC view that 
security is an issue for "sovereign states."  Garner said 
Canada wants APEC to endorse the Health Task Force's action 
plan from the May Ministerial, and commented that the plan 
dovetails with USG views (e.g. on Avian flu).  Garner also 
stated that Canada has proposed counterterrorism language for 
the Leaders' Statement and favored extending the moratorium 
on APEC membership expiration for another three years. 
 
¶4. (sbu) When asked about Vietnamese preparations for APEC, 
Garner commented that Vietnam has been "very late" in 
providing information to APEC member states, and that Canada 
has yet to receive the first draft of the Leaders' Statement 
or the final agenda for the Leaders. 
 
GOC Participation 
----------------- 
 
¶5. (sbu) Garner stated that Prime Minister Stephen Harper, 
Foreign Minister Peter McKay, and International Trade 
Minister David Emerson would all travel to Hanoi.  She said 
because APEC 2006 will be the Prime Minister's first trip to 
Asia - and because he already knows President Bush well - 
Harper will likely not request a bilateral meeting with the 
QHarper will likely not request a bilateral meeting with the 
President.  Instead, Harper plans on seeking bilaterals with 
Asian economies. 
 
Request for Further Information 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Garner stated that Canadian Ambassador to the United 
States Wilson -- along with six other ambassadors -- will be 
attending an NSC meeting on APEC this Monday, October 30. 
She said Wilson would likely reiterate GOC views, and seek 
more details regarding USG views on: 
 
-- the Business Travel Card initiative; 
 
-- whether North Korea should be discussed in Hanoi, and 
whether the USG would seek a multilateral side meeting with 
North Korea involving Secretary Rice.  (Garner asked if the 
 
OTTAWA 00003248  002 OF 002 
 
 
USG might support a statement regarding North Korea, saying 
there is a precedent.) 
 
-- addressing the situation in Thailand given the recent 
coup; and 
 
-- how best pursue an FTA in the Asia-Pacific region.
