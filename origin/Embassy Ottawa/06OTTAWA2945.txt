SUBJECT: CANADA'S RESPONSE TO PROPOSAL FOR INTERNATIONAL 
CONVENTION ON DATA PROTECTION REFERENCE IN FRANCOPHONIE 
SUMMIT STATEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 159673 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1. (SBU) On September 27, Economic Minister-Counselor 
presented reftel demarche to Chantal de Varennes, Deputy 
Director, Francophonie Affairs Division, Foreign Affairs 
Canada (DFAIT), and Alain Tellier, Deputy Director, Criminal, 
Security and Treaty Law Division, DFAIT.  Both were familiar 
with the last minute French efforts to insert language 
calling for an international convention guaranteeing the 
effectiveness of data protection law in the final declaration 
of the September 28-29 Francophonie Summit in Bucharest, 
Romania. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Tellier provided Embassy with the text of the 
original French proposal: 
 
"Nous appelons a l'intensification des travaux de nature 
legislative, reglementaire et organisationnelle necessaires a 
la mise en oeuvre effective des regles de la protection des 
personnes, de leurs liberte et droits fondamentaux dans 
l'utilisation des fichiers et traitements de donnees a 
caractere personnel, et, conscients de developpement de la 
circulation de donnees personnelles a travers les frontieres, 
sommes resolu a examiner en profondeur l'elaboration d'une 
convention internationale garantissant, dans ces 
circonstances, l'effectivite de cette protection." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Our interlocutors agreed with the U.S. demarche that 
the data protection issue is not appropriate to appear in the 
final statement of the Francophonie Summit, Declaration of 
Bucharest, and had wanted to have the paragraph removed. 
However, the GOC eventually concluded for political reasons 
that the matter could not be dropped entirely.  Subsequently, 
experts and Francophonie Ministers on September 26 agreed to 
a reformulation of the paragraph, which Canada believes 
weakens its intent. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The revised language is as follows: 
 
"Nous appelons a l'intensification des travaux necessaires a 
l'adoption des legislations assurant la protection des 
personnes, de leurs libertes et de leurs droits fondamentaux 
dans l'utilisation des fichiers et traitements de donnees a 
caractere personnel et, conscients de l'accroissement de la 
circulation des donnees personnelles au-dela des frontieres, 
marquons notre interet pour examiner l'opportunite d'elaborer 
un instrument international garantissant, dans ces 
circonstances, le droits des personnes a la protection des 
donnees a caractere personnel, tout en tenant compte de nos 
objectifs legitimes en matiere de lutte contre le crime, la 
corruption et le terrorisme." 
 
¶5. (SBU) The new language will be given to the Chiefs of 
State and Heads of Government attending the Summit in 
Bucharest tomorrow.   The Canadians believe that it will be 
approved unchanged, and promised to contact the Embassy if 
there are any changes.  Note:  The Canadian delegation is 
headed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and includes Minister 
for International Development and for la Francophonie and 
Official Languages Josee Verner, Quebec Premier Jean Charest 
and New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord (who was defeated for 
re-election last week, but his successor Shawn Graham asked 
him to represent the province).  End note. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Tellier suggested that the revised language calling 
for an international "instrument" rather than a "convention" 
provides a great deal of flexibility.  An instrument, he 
Qprovides a great deal of flexibility.  An instrument, he 
explained, could be model legislation, a memorandum of 
understanding, or other type of less than binding 
undertaking.  Moreover, Tellier pointed out that the final 
sentence's reference to "taking account of our legitimate 
objectives in the war against crime, corruption and 
terrorism" was a great improvement.  He said that the 
International Law Commission (ILC) in New York may be 
contemplating work in the area of data protection.  Canada 
would support such efforts, which Tellier pointed out, could 
take many years and the final result could take many 
different forms. 
 
¶7. (U) Speaking more generally, the Canadians noted that the 
inclusion of language on data protection indicates that the 
Francophonie Summit, which meets every two years, is 
 
OTTAWA 00002945  002 OF 002 
 
 
expanding its scope from the promotion of the French language 
and culture to other issues, including politics, economics 
and human rights.  The next Francophonie summit will take 
place in Quebec City in 2008, as part of the celebration of 
the 400th anniversary of the French presence in Canada.
