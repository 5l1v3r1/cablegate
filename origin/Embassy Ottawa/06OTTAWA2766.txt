SUBJECT: CANADA "HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION" ON JOINING 
CAWT 
 
REF: STATE 148162 
 
¶1.  On September 11 the Ambassador discussed the Secretary's 
invitation to participate in her press event on the Coalition 
Against Wildlife Trafficking (CAWT) with Foreign Minister 
Peter MacKay, urging that Canada join CAWT and pressing 
MacKay to attend the September 22 event in New York. 
Although MacKay was non-committal as to Canada joining CAWT, 
noting this was a cabinet decision that fell primarily under 
the jurisdiction of Environment Minister Rona Ambrose, he did 
tell the Ambassador he believed things were "heading in the 
right direction." 
 
¶2.  EST Counselor also discussed the invitation and Canada's 
interest in CAWT with contacts in Environment Canada (EC) and 
Foreign Affairs Canada (DFAIT).  Foreign Affairs contacts 
acknowledged that Canada was taking a long time in deciding 
on joining CAWT and admitted that the Secretary's invitation 
might help concerned ministries reach that decision more 
expeditiously.  Environment Canada contacts told Embassy that 
Ambrose has said "Canada would like to find a way to join 
CAWT," and that she hopes to be involved in a public 
announcement of Canada,s partnership in CAWT. 
 
¶3.  Embassy will continue to monitor developments at both EC 
and DFAIT, urging that Canada decide affirmatively and that 
Foreign Minister MacKay attend the Secretary's CAWT press 
event in New York on September 22.
