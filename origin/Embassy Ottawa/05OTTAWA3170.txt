The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) tells us 
that they have spoken with Mr. Osman and CIDA will be support 
his effort as well as other work by the NGO he is working 
with (International Development and Relief Foundation.  It 
and Mr. Osman are approved "Matching Partners" of CIDA's). 
IDRF plans to arrange the charter flights, which they
