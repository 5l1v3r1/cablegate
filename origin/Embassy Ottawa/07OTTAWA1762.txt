REF: STATE 128336 
 
(SBU) On September 14 econoff delivered points in reftel to 
Manuel Mulas, Trade Officer, Intellectual Property Division, 
Department of Trade and Foreign Affairs.  Mulas said that 
Canada agrees in principle with the United States that DG 
Idris should be held accountable for his actions.  He 
explained that the U.S. and Canadian missions in Geneva work 
closely together, and that Canada will coordinate with the 
United States to fend off procedural maneuvering designed to 
prevent discussion of the internal auditor's report 
concerning Idris' use of multiple birthdates for personal 
gain.  Mulas said that Canada's strategy on dealing with 
Idris had not yet been approved by his supervisors, and he 
was unable to comment on whether Canada would approach Idris 
to request that he resign.  However, Mulas promised to share 
this information as soon as it became available.
