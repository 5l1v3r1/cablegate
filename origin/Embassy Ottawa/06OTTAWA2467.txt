circumstances beyond their control.  Today's announcement is

by the Red Cross Movement, the United Nations and other

activities, as called for in UNSCR 1701.

emergency food assistance and C$750,000 for logistic 
operations during the Lebanon crisis); 
b) C$750,000 to UNICEF for providing adequate water and 
sanitation support in south Lebanon; 
c) C$750,000 to UNICEF and WHO for providing primary health 
care services;

displaced persons and refugees in Lebanon and neighboring

Logistics Center to provide logistics coordination and 
support for humanitarian activities in Lebanon; and 
f) C$250,000 to the Office of Humanitarian Affairs for 
coordinating the humanitarian response. 
 
¶5. (U) Canada has also supported the efforts of humanitarian

of relief supplies.
