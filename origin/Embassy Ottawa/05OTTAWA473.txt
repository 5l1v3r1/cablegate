(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Lajos Arendas, 
Deputy Director of the Central America and Caribbean Division 
of Foreign Affairs Canada.  Arendas said that he has been in 
touch with the Department (EB) on the issue and understands 
that there has not been a decision yet on whether Secretary 
Rice will attend.  He said Canada agrees that the meeting is 
not a good idea, although while we oppose its venue, Canada 
stands in opposition to the agenda.  Arendas said that Canada 
asked France to change the forum to better reflect a 
political agenda, which is what is needed at present, rather 
than the specific aid focus.  Given the agenda, Ottawa also 
does not believe that it should be held at the Ministerial 
level, and questions how it would be synchronized with the 
prep meeting on 24 February.  He did say, however, that if 
Secretary Rice decides to attend, FM Pettigrew would probably 
 
SIPDIS 
attend as well; if not Ottawa would be represented by CIDA 
Director Carroll.
