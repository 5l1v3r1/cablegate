¶1.  (SBU) DCM conveyed ref A points November 1 to Jonathan 
Fried, the Prime Minister's senior foreign policy advisor. 
We provided follow-up copies to Foreign Affairs Canada and 
the Canadian International Development Agency.  Canada 
responded quickly and generously to the South Asian 
earthquake (summary below) and continues to evaluate needs. 
Fried reminded us that Canada was already making a 
considerable contribution, proudly pointing out that on a 
per-capita or per-GDP basis their response is probably larger 
than that of the 
U.S.  He added it is a given that the GOC will encourage 
other donors to give more generously.  (Note:  Canada's 
population and GDP are about one tenth those of the U.S. 
End Note.)  The GOC has confirmed that supplies collected by 
Pakistan's consul general in Toronto would be useful in 
earthquake relief and are working with the GOP on the most 
effective way to transport the goods (para 4). 
 
C$57 million so far... 
---------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Canada's initial C$300,000 contribution 
(approximately US$255,000) on October 8 was quickly 
followed on October 10 by C$20 million (about US$17 
million), part of which was allocated to winterized 
blankets, other basic needs and long-term reconstruction. 
The funding was distributed through the ICRC, the Aga Khan 
Foundation Canada, and Save the Children Canada.  The GOC 
also sent experts to the region to assess future needs (ref 
B). 
 
 
¶3.  (U) On October 26, the GOC announced an additional C$20 
million for humanitarian assistance, relief and 
reconstruction efforts. That commitment, plus the cost of 
deploying Canada's DART team, bring the total to C$57 
million (almost US$50 million). 
 
Private donations

¶4.  (SBU) We understand that the winterized tents provided 
by the Canadian NGO (Refs C and D) have arrived in Pakistan. 
Foreign Affairs Canada has confirmed that the Pakistani CG 
in Toronto has assembled about 130,000 pounds of medical 
and related supplies.  The GOC and Pakistani CG are 
evaluating the most effective way to expedite shipment of 
the supplies.
