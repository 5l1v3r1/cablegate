SUBJECT: TERRORIST FACILITATORS AND INCITERS ADDED TO 
CANADA'S UN AL-QAIDA AND TALIBAN LIST 
 
REF: A. OTTAWA 3566 
     ¶B. STATE 196698 (BOTH NOTAL) 
 
¶1. (U) On December 8, the Office of the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI) notified all Canadian 
financial institutions that two individuals (together with a 
number of aliases) have been made subject to the United 
Nations Al-Qaida and Taliban Regulations by virtue of having 
been added to the list subject to UN Security Council 
Resolutions.  The name added are Najmuddin Faraj Ahmad 
(aliases: Mullah Krekar, Fateh Najm Eddine Farraj, Faraj 
Ahmad Najmuddin) and Mohamed Moumou (aliases: Mohamed Mumu, 
Abu Shrayda, Abu Amina, Abu Abdallah, Abou Abderrahman).  The 
OSFI notice also advised banks about additional information 
regarding an individual already listed: Ghuma Abd'rabbah. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The pre-notification that the U.S. had given to the 
GoC about these names (and others) before they were submitted 
to the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee allowed OSFI to move very 
quickly in notifying banks once the Sanctions Committee had 
acted.
