REF: STATE 68527 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) According to Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade Burma Desk Officer Chrystal 
Waddington, Canada fully agrees with the U.S. view (reftel) 
that the international community should continue to make 
clear to Burmese authorities that further assistance will 
depend on full access, transparency, and accountability. 
Waddington confirmed that Canada remains committed to 
pressuring Burma to provide unhindered access and to 
demonstrate greater transparency and promised that Canada 
would closely study the revised UN appeal for humanitarian 
assistance that the UN plans to release o/a July 10.
