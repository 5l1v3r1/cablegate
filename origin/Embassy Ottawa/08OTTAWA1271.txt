¶1.  (SBU) Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) Deputy Director for Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Craig Weichel has verified that Canada had co-sponsored the 
U.S. Compliance Resolution at the UN First Committee in 2005 
(ref a) and that DFAIT was therefore "in a good position" to 
co-sponsor the 2008 Resolution, despite the pre-election 
caretaker rules in effect that limit bureaucrats only to "do 
as they did" in the past until a new government emerges after 
the October 14 federal election.  Weichel confirmed that he 
had shared this information with colleagues at the Canadian 
Mission in Geneva.
