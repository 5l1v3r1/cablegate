¶1.  Embassy Ottawa plans to organize an event in March 2006, 
in lieu of this Fall.  As in 2003 and 2004, the likely venue 
would be the Ambassador's residence and we would invite a 
range of government and non-government interlocutors. 
ConGen-Toronto is also considering organizing an event during 
the same time period.
