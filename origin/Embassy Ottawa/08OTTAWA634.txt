SUBJECT: CANADA CONCERNED ABOUT REDUNDANCY OF G8 INITIATIVE 
ON TERRORIST ABUSE OF CHARITIES 
 
REF: SECSTATE 46472 
 
¶1. (U) On May 5 Econoff delivered reftel points to Yves 
Beaulieu, Deputy Director, International Crime and Terrorism, 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. 
Beaulieu confirmed that Canada had received the proposal on 
April 10 and stated that Canada share the USG's concern 
regarding terrorist abuse of charities.  However, Beaulieu 
stated that the Government of Canada did not have a position 
on the USG initiative. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On May 7 Beaulieu stated that: 
"We take (this issue) very seriously.  Canada is concerned 
about the manipulation and abuse of the charitable sector by 
terrorists and terrorist groups.  We note that the FATF is 
already working on this issue via its work on Special 
Recommendation 8.  We are seeking clarification on how the 
proposed G-8 Financial Ministers' action plan would 
complement or add incremental value to the work already being 
undertaken by FATF." 
 
¶3. (U) EEB/TFS has asked U.S. Department of Treasury 
officials to contact Beaulieu to clarify how the G-8 
Initiative will complement the FATF's work.
