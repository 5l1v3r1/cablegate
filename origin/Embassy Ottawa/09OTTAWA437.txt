SUBJECT: CANADA SUPPORTS U.S. CANDIDATE MYERS IN ICSC 
ELECTION 
 
REF: STATE 55499 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Canada will support the election of U.S. candidate 
Lucretia Myers in the upcoming election for the UN 
International Civil Service Commission, according to 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade's UN 
and Commonwealth Affairs Division Deputy Director 
Shannon-Marie Soni.  Ms. Myers' experience and cooperative 
relationship with like-minded reformers on the ICSC impressed 
Canada, Soni noted.  She emphasized Ms. Myer's expertise in 
the areas of compensation and benefits as especially 
noteworthy, and complimented her work in combating "double 
dipping" by retired UN civil servants. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Soni underlined that Canada places a high priority 
on achieving greater gender balance throughout the UN 
personnel system, but especially at the ICSC.  Canada also 
wants to see more non-European candidates representing the 
WEOG, according to Soni.  Both factors played significant yet 
secondary roles in winning Canadian support for Ms. Myers, 
Soni commented.  She promised that the Canadian mission in 
New York will follow up with a diplomatic note to the U.S. 
mission formally notifying the U.S. of Canada's support. 
Soni indicated that Canada might not re-nominate Canadian 
ICSC member Anita Szlazak, since she has already served two 
terms, which is generally the "unofficial limit" for such 
appointments.
