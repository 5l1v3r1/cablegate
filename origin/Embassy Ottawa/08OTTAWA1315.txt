REF: STATE 105510 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Many Canadians viewed the 2008 Beijing Summer 
Olympics through the prism of Canadian preparations for the 
2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, and were deeply impressed by 
the smooth success of the sporting events in China, as well 
as by the dramatic new sporting venues.  The Beijing Olympics 
received widespread and generally positive media coverage, 
not exclusively on events featuring Canadian athletes but 
also more broadly.  There were nonetheless negative reports 
about internet restrictions, empty demonstration zones, the 
deception over the singing during the opening ceremony, the 
possibility that some Chinese gymnasts were underage, and 
chronic problems with air pollution.  Some reports contrasted 
the high tech sporting infrastructure with other less 
developed parts of China, while usually noting the dramatic 
economic development over the past three decades.  Prime 
Minister Stephen Harper received some public criticism for 
his decision not to attend the opening ceremonies, although 
he did not link this decision specifically to human rights 
concerns. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Despite the bump in attention during the games, 
China remains off the radar scope for most Canadians and not 
central to Canada's fundamental foreign policy interests, 
which focus primarily on the United States and on its 
commitment under NATO to Afghanistan.  Canadians appreciate 
new economic and trade opportunities with China, while 
recognizing that about 80 pct of their exports go to the U.S. 
market.  They retain fundamental human rights concerns about 
China, with special concern about Tibet; Canada has awarded 
the Dalai Lama with honorary Canadian citizenship, and PM 
Harper has met with the Dalai Lama in Ottawa. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The 2008 election campaign platforms of both the 
ruling Conservative Party and the Official Opposition Liberal 
Party (which were likely written before the Olympics, 
although the Governor General did not call for new elections 
-- at the government's request -- until September 7) include 
only brief references to China.  The Conservatives indicated 
that they would proceed with plans to open a trade office in 
China and other growing markets, but also promised to 
establish a new non-partisan democratic promotion agency 
(without linking this new agency with China specifically). 
The Liberals promised to "rebuild the economic and diplomatic 
relationship between Canada and China, a relationship frayed 
by Conservative grandstanding and showmanship" and to "give 
this relationship increased priority," notably to obtain 
"Official Destination Status" so that more Chinese tourists 
would visit Canada.  The Liberals also announced that, if 
victorious, they would establish "Canadian Centres for 
Democracy" -- starting in the Middle East -- but did not 
indicate if they would seek such a center in China.
