Sensitive but Unclassified.  Protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy made demarche requested reftel and discussed 
U.S. views on Zimbabwe chairing the 16th session of the UN 
Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD-16) with Pamela 
O'Donnell, director of the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade's Sustainable Development Division. 
O'Donnell confirmed that Canada has similar concerns with 
Francis Nhema chairing CSD-16 and is "on the same wavelength" 
with the U.S. on this matter. 
 
¶2. (SBU) O'Donnell said the Canadian delegation to the 
meeting will be lead by her deputy (Rachel McCormick), but 
that the highest ranking member of the delegation will 
actually be a director general (roughly equivalent to a 
deputy assistant secretary) from Agriculture Canada.  While 
Canada will thus not be represented at a high level at 
CSD-16, this in fact is not a departure from previous 
meetings: O'Donnell said it had been years since a Canadian 
minister attended. 
 
¶3. (SBU) O'Donnell added that Canadian officials had been 
hearing rumors recently that Zimbabwe might yield chair 
duties for the meeting to Tanzania, ostensibly because Nhema 
might not be able to depart Zimbabwe.
