SUBJECT: CANADA CALLS ON IRAN TO END ENRICHMENT PROGRAM 
 
¶1.   (U)  Canadian Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon on February 8 
issued a statement expressing concern over Iran's decision further 
to enrich nuclear material, and calling on Iran to "end its 
contempt for the international community" and to "take steps toward 
transparency and compliance" with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency.  Full text in para 2. 
 
 
¶2.  (U)  Begin text 
 
 
"Canada is deeply disappointed by Iran's decision to further enrich 
its nuclear material. The rights to nuclear enrichment come with 
international obligations that all nations, including Iran, must 
respect. 
 
"Iran has continued to blatantly ignore these obligations and has 
deliberately concealed the nature of its nuclear ambitions 
throughout the history of its nuclear program. 
 
"Iran's announcement that it will no longer limit the enrichment of 
its nuclear fuel raises the question of how far and for how long 
Iran is willing to test the patience of the international 
community. 
 
"Canada calls upon Iran to end its contempt for the international 
community, address the serious lack of confidence among the 
international community, and immediately take steps toward 
transparency and compliance by ending its enrichment activity, 
ceasing construction of new enrichment sites, and cooperating with 
International Atomic Energy Agency investigations. Canada will work 
with other members of the international community toward a solution 
that will hold Iran to account." 
 
An increase in uranium enrichment from 3.5 percent to 20 percent is 
considered "weapons usable" and is sufficient for a nuclear weapon.
