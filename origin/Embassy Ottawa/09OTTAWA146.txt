REF: STATE 16118 
 
¶1. (SBU) Justice Rose Boyko is a "trailblazer among First 
Nations people in Canada," according to Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) UN Section Deputy 
Director Shannon Marie Soni.  Soni added that Boyko was the 
first aboriginal Canadian woman appointed as a superior court 
judge in Canada after a long and distinguished career as 
legal advisor in federal and provincial governments.  DFAIT 
conducted extensive vetting of Boyko, according to Soni, and 
discovered no derogatory information with regard to her 
judicial temperament or reputation for impartiality.  Boyko 
has been a judge of the Ontario Court of Justice (General 
Division) since 1994, and a lawyer since 1982. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy investigation of open source material on 
Justice Boyko yielded no adverse information.  She is also a 
former Vice President of the Indigenous Bar Association and 
the current Vice President of the Canadian chapter of the 
International Association of Women Judges.  She is keenly 
interested in social issues and attaches great importance to 
maintaining her aboriginal identity and values, according to 
media reports.  She has also expressed interest publicly in 
aboriginal sentencing circles to promote reconciliation 
between the victims of crime and offenders. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Soni also noted that Canada plans to support U.S. 
candidate Judge Mark Painter.
