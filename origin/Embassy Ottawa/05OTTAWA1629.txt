NOMINATING-OFFICER: PAO Alyson Grunder 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Since the Bloc Quebecois' strong showing in the 2004 federal 
election, we have been on the lookout for a BQ 
representative to nominate for the IV program.  We believe 
Marie-France Charbonneau, Bloc political advisor, would make 
an excellent candidate for a program devoted to current 
issues in U.S.-Canada relations, federalism and 
and 
decentralization in the U.S. political system, and U.S. 
perspectives on globalization, including its impact on 
international security. 
Charbonneau proved her loyalty to the Quebec separatist 
movement when early in her career she ran for the provincial 
legislature as a sacrificial Parti Quebecois lamb, in a 
strong Liberal (federalist) riding.  Since that 1989 race, 
she has worked continuously as a political advisor to senior 
PQ and Bloc politicians, including former Quebec Premier 
Bernard Landry, and currently, BQ leader Gilles Duceppe. 
Charbonneau is bright, trusted and supported by the inner 
circle of senior elected officials in the Bloc.  She was 
tasked with planning and organizing Duceppe's public events 
during the 2004 election campaign, and his recent speaking 
tours outside of Quebec.  Charbonneau well understands that 
the U.S. strongly favors a united Canada, but she makes the 
case that Americans need to understand that the sovereignist 
cause has many supporters in Quebec, including among young 
voters.  She, and her separatist colleagues, would also 
benefit from hearing the American arguments for federalism, 
within a decentralized political system.
