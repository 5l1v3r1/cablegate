SUBJECT: CANADA STAGES TOUR TO RAISE IPR AWARENESS 
 
¶1. (U) On June 4, the Canadian Anti-Counterfeiting Network 
(CACN) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) hosted 
the Ottawa segment of the 2008 CACN/RCMP Canadian "Reality" 
Tour to boost awareness of counterfeiting and piracy.  The 
tour began in April and will stop in ten cities across 
Canada, including Vancouver, Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, 
Mississauga, Ottawa, Montreal, Moncton, Charlottetown and 
Halifax.  The presentations by government officials and 
industry stakeholders highlighted the prevalence of 
Intellectual property rights (IPR) crime in digital 
entertainment, pharmaceuticals, and health products in 
Canada.  A representative from the RCMP said his organization 
hopes that the GOC will grant ex-officio powers to Canadian 
customs and border officials that would allow them to seize 
pirated and counterfeit goods. 
 
¶2. (U) The tour will conclude in Halifax at the RCMP and 
INTERPOL's 2008 International Law Enforcement IP Crime 
Conference from June 24-26.  Several USG officials will be 
speaking at this conference, including: Mark Filip, United 
States Deputy Attorney General, Mark Cohen, U.S. Embassy 
Beijing Senior Intellectual Property Attach, and Wayne 
Paugh, Acting U.S. Coordinator for International Intellectual 
Property Enforcement. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Canada's protection of IPR is among the 
weakest in the G8.  It is encouraging to see the RCMP working 
to increase public awareness of IPR crime in Canada.  End
