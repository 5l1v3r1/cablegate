REF: A. OTTAWA 1523 
     ¶B. STATE 127557 
 
Classified By: PolMinCouns Scott Bellard, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request -- see para 4. 
 
¶2. . (C) Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) Assistant Deputy Minister for Asia and Africa 
Ken Sundquist confirmed to DCM on December 8 that he had 
briefed Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon on a possible 
Canadian contribution for heavy fuel oil for North Korea and 
its importance to the Six Party Talks (reftels).  According 
to Sundquist, FM Cannon "wants to be helpful" and hopes to 
have an answer for Secretary Rice at their meeting in 
Washington on December 12.  Sundquist promised that DFAIT 
staff would continue to work on securing funding. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment: Despite Sundquist's signal that the foreign 
minister was intent on finding a way to be helpful, the 
nature of Canada's cabinet government may limit Cannon's 
response to saying he is "actively exploring" options for a 
contribution for HFO purchases.  If, somehow, he is able to 
fast-track his request through the Treasury Board, he may 
tell the Secretary that he is "actively consulting" with 
cabinet, which would indicate that he has been 
bureaucratically more successful in finding money for HFO. 
Canada's current obsession with domestic political 
maneuvering (which led to a temporary suspension of 
Parliament on December 4) and the government's hesitation 
about posting Canada's first budget deficit in over a decade 
will make it more difficult than usual for the government to 
launch a new program like this.  End Summary. 
 
¶4. (C) Action request:  to underscore the importance of this 
issue to the USG, Embassy recommends that a Canadian HFO 
contribution definitely be part of the Secretary's December 
12 meeting agenda with FM Cannon.
