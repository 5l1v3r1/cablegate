SUBJECT: NUCLEAR SUPPLIERS GROUP: CANADA WILL JOIN 
CONSENSUS ON ENR 
 
REF: STATE 126581 
 
Â¶1. (SBU)  Canada will join consensus on the U.S. proposal for 
strengthening Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) control of 
transfers of enrichment and reprocessing (ENR) equipment and 
technology, according to Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT) non-proliferation senior policy 
advisor Che van Haastrecht.  Van Haastrecht said that he had 
been instructed to pass on the "high level of appreciation by 
senior levels of DFAIT" over U.S. flexibility in taking into 
account Canadian concerns in the original proposal.  Although 
he described the current draft proposal as "not perfect" and 
containing "a certain amount of ambiguity," van Haastrecht 
said it does meet Canada's needs from economic and 
non-proliferation points of view.  Canada is drafting a 
letter for the NSG Consultative Group chair to make its 
agreement formal and to lay out its understanding of how the 
U.S. proposal will operate, according to van Haastrecht.  He 
added that Canada originally had concerns about sections 7 
(b) and  (c), with the latter being the predominant concern. 
Van Haastrecht also expressed keen interest in the reactions 
of key capitals, including Moscow, Brasilia, Buenos Aires, 
Pretoria, and the EU.
