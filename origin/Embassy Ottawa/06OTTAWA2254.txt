E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER TBIO PINS EAGR EUN CA
SUBJ: Canada on proposed G8 BTEX Food Defense Tabletop Exercise 
 
Ref: State 112285 
 
¶1. Post provided talking points and exercise description in early 
July to Sebastien Beaulieu, Deputy Director and to Clare McIntyre, 
Policy Advisor - Precursors to Terrorism, CBRN in the International 
Crime and Terrorism Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade Canada (DFAIT).  Beaulieu and McIntyre 
undertook to circulate the details of the proposed exercise to other 
GoC departments with a stake in this issue, principally the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency, Health Canada and the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police and to solicit expressions of interest from those departments 
in participating.  The initial response from McIntyre was that the 
GoC would be interested in participating. 
 
¶2. The promised fuller response from the GoC on the proposed 
exercise, however, has been hampered by the lack of staff in GoC 
offices due to vacation, official travel and departure of rotational 
staff.   McIntyre of DFAIT will be available again on July 31 and we 
hope to receive a more substantive GoC response to the proposal 
shortly thereafter, which we will subsequently relay to OES/IHA on a 
priority basis.
