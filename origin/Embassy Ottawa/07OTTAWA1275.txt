STORM VICTIMS 
 
¶1. Foreign Minister MacKay and International Development 
Minister Verner announced in a July 4 press release that 
Canada will contribute up to C$2 million to provide immediate 
relief to the people of Pakistan and Afghanistan affected by 
recent flash floods and landslides.  The humanitarian aid 
will be provided through trusted international and local 
partners involved in the relief effort.  While India was also 
affected by the storms, the press release said that Indian 
government has not requested international assistance. 
 
¶2.  MacKay said that "on behalf of all Canadians, I extend my 
deepest sympathies to all those affected by the flooding. 
Ensuring their safety and responding to their basic human 
needs is important to the Government of Canada.  We have been 
in close touch with the governments (of Pakistan and 
Afghanistan) and with humanitarian partners to determine the 
best way for Canada to assist."  Verner added that "this new 
funding builds on existing Canadian humanitarian programs. 
For instance, in Afghanistan, food and other immediate relief 
is already provided through existing agreements with the 
World Food Program and UNICEF."  The press release said that 
Canada may adjust its contribution as needs in the affected 
areas are assessed.
