START MEMO POST-OBJ: 
Derek Brown is Executive Director of the Resource 
Development and Geoscience Branch in the British Columbia 
Ministry of Energy and Mines, Oil and Gas Division.  He 
directs a Branch team of about 30 people who stimulate and 
facilitate oil and gas activities across British Columbia. 
Derek further serves as an important link for B.C. with 
Canadian energy associations in Alberta and elsewhere in the 
country. He also plays an important role promoting BC's 
resource opportunities to national and international groups. 
Derek Brown is an influential player on B.C.'s energy 
exploration policymaking team who would greatly benefit from 
participation in the IVL Program. 
B.C.'s Coalbed Gas Strategy is one example of the 
multifaceted projects Derek's office manages. The strategy 
Derek developed for coalbed methane includes promotion of 
the potential resource, geological studies, information 
sessions for First Nations and other stakeholders, 
regulatory review, and assistance on tenure issues.  In the 
United States, coalbed gas already contributes over 8% of 
the domestic natural gas supply.  Therefore, Derek wants to 
build strong partnerships with U.S. government agencies 
(municipal, State and Federal), the upstream gas industry 
and other U.S. interest groups to learn more. 
Derek's Ministry pushes unconventional gas exploration such 
as coalbed methane gas to try to stay on top of the changing 
trends in gas prices as well as limited supplies.  However, 
officials at the ministry do not understand the U.S. system 
well. Therefore, we at the Consulate have been working 
closely with Derek to help him better understand how gas 
exploration policy works in the U.S.  For example, we serve 
as an important liaison to bolster communication between his 
office and the State of Montana, where coalbed methane is 
being explored along the B.C./Montana border. 
B.C. is and increasingly will be a valued energy source for 
the growing North American energy market.  Derek's 
participation in the IVL program would enhance the building 
of networks and expanding partnerships between Canada and 
the U.S.  An individual program would deepen his growing 
understanding of U.S. energy policy, particularly in regards 
to how federal, state and municipal regulations all play a 
role in the U.S.'s comprehensive energy exploration 
policies. He would bring back a hands-on understanding and 
appreciation of energy policy to Canada and British 
Columbia. This understanding would be extremely useful in 
future dealings with the U.S. during the many years Derek 
has ahead of him in this very important strategic sector.
