¶1. (SBU) Charge and Political Minister Counselor took the 
opportunity of a meeting with Foreign Affairs Assistant 
Deputy Minister (between A/S and U/S level) Jim Wright to 
raise USG concerns about the potential proliferation loophole 
caused by failure to address "captive use" of CWC Schedule I 
chemicals. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Wright said that following his Friday conversation 
setting up the meeting with Charge, he checked with Canada's 
National Coordinator, Bob Brooks, who told him this 
essentially had been resolved in the most recent discussions 
in The Hague.  Wright said Brooks was aware of a "fix", and 
the U.K., Canada, the U.S. and others were all on board.  If 
this was not the case, Wright said, we should get in touch 
with him right away. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a subsequent conversation with polmiloff and POL 
M/C, Brooks affirmed that general agreement on a resolution 
had been reached.  The only outstanding item was Canada's 
desire for a "blanket exemption" and USG's strong preference 
for addressing exemptions on a case-by-case basis.  Brooks 
said he did not believe that Canada would stand in the way of 
resolving the captive use issue by insisting on a blanket 
exemption, assuming that some language could be found to 
stipulate that the cases should be dealt with in an 
expeditious fashion.
