¶1. Summary: The economies, societies and environments of Canada and 
the United States are inextricably intertwined; the relationship is 
most easily reflected in the staggering volume of bilateral trade -- 
over US$1.5 billion a day in goods - and the 300,000 people who 
cross the shared border every day to work or visit.  Moreover, 
Canada is the single largest foreign supplier of fossil fuels to the 
United States (providing 17 percent of U.S. oil imports and over 80 
percent of U.S. natural gas imports).  Our food and agriculture 
markets are almost completely integrated, with Canada accounting for 
about 20 percent of total US agri-food imports.  In addition our two 
countries' financial markets and telecommunications and electrical 
networks are highly interconnected.  As a consequence of this 
exceptional interrelationship a disruption to Canada's critical 
infrastructure (CI) could have an immediate and deleterious impact 
on the United States. Because it would be virtually impossible to 
provide an exhaustive accounting of Canada's CI, this cable gives 
illustrative examples of CI in various sectors. Protection of CI is 
a Canadian national priority, and Canada is a close and trusted 
partner with the United States in working to protect CI in North 
America.  End summary. 
Canada's Approach to CI 
¶2. Like the United States, Canada's critical infrastructure consists 
of physical and information technology facilities, networks, 
services and assets essential to the health, safety, security or 
economic well-being of its citizens, or to the effective functioning 
of government.  In many respects, the two countries should be viewed 
as sharing the same infrastructure (pipelines, bridges, power and 
phone lines) sprawling across a shared economic space.  As in the 
United States, it is estimated that most (between 85 and 95 
percent)of Canada's critical infrastructure is owned and operated by 
private sector firms, which therefore bear primary responsibility 
for the development and implementation of business continuity plans. 
In addition to the federal government's role, the provinces and 
territories also have a significant jurisdictional role in critical 
infrastructure protection and emergency management.  These 
government entities also own and regulate some critical 
infrastructure. 
¶3. Canada has established the National Critical Infrastructure 
Assurance Program (NCIAP) - an ongoing collaboration between private 
sector partners and federal, provincial and territorial governments 
- to provide a national framework for cooperative action and to 
build a resilient national critical infrastructure. The federal 
government classifies critical infrastructure within ten sectors, as 
opposed to the USG classification system of 17 critical 
infrastructure/key resources sectors. 
¶4.  The 10 Canadian sectors are: 
* Energy and Utilities (e.g., electrical power, natural gas, oil 
production/transmission) 
* Information and Communications Technology (e.g., 
telecommunications, broadcasting systems, software, hardware, and 
networks including the Internet) 
* Finance (e.g., large-value payment, securities clearing and 
settlement systems) 
* Health Care (e.g., hospitals, blood-supply facilities and 
pharmaceutical manufacturers) 
* Food (e.g., safety, distribution, agriculture and food industry) 
Q* Food (e.g., safety, distribution, agriculture and food industry) 
* Water (e.g., drinking water and wastewater management) 
* Transportation (e.g., road, rail, marine, and aviation) 
* Safety (e.g., chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear 
safety, dangerous goods, search and rescue, emergency services and 
dams) 
* Government (e.g., services, facilities, information networks and 
key national monuments) 
* Manufacturing (e.g., defense industrial base, chemical industry) 
Cooperation with the United States 
¶5. At the federal government level, the Public Safety Canada is 
responsible for national CI policy.  Public Safety Canada works 
primarily with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
(particularly with the Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection) 
on the identification of shared CI, threat analysis and response 
planning; since 2005, under the auspices of the SPP.  We understand 
that Public Safety Canada and DHS have recently collaborated on a 
detailed threat analysis of shared CI. Post would welcome a copy.

as sharing the same infrastructure (pipelines, bridges, power and

United States, it is estimated that most (between 85 and 95 
percent)of Canada's critical infrastructure is owned and operated by 
private sector firms, which therefore bear primary responsibility 
for the development and implementation of business continuity plans. 
In addition to the federal government's role, the provinces and 
territories also have a significant jurisdictional role in critical 
infrastructure protection and emergency management.  These 
government entities also own and regulate some critical 
infrastructure.

Assurance Program (NCIAP) - an ongoing collaboration between private 
sector partners and federal, provincial and territorial governments 
- to provide a national framework for cooperative action and to 
build a resilient national critical infrastructure. The federal 
government classifies critical infrastructure within ten sectors, as 
opposed to the USG classification system of 17 critical 
infrastructure/key resources sectors.

networks including the Internet) 
* Finance (e.g., large-value payment, securities clearing and

key national monuments) 
* Manufacturing (e.g., defense industrial base, chemical industry)

responsible for national CI policy.  Public Safety Canada works 
primarily with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
(particularly with the Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection) 
on the identification of shared CI, threat analysis and response

Canada's Approach to CI 
¶2. Like the United States, Canada's critical infrastructure consists 
of physical and information technology facilities, networks, 
services and assets essential to the health, safety, security or 
economic well-being of its citizens, or to the effective functioning 
of government.  In many respects, the two countries should be viewed 
as sharing the same infrastructure (pipelines, bridges, power and 
phone lines) sprawling across a shared economic space.  As in the 
United States, it is estimated that most (between 85 and 95 
percent)of Canada's critical infrastructure is owned and operated by 
private sector firms, which therefore bear primary responsibility 
for the development and implementation of business continuity plans. 
In addition to the federal government's role, the provinces and 
territories also have a significant jurisdictional role in critical 
infrastructure protection and emergency management.  These 
government entities also own and regulate some critical 
infrastructure. 
¶3. Canada has established the National Critical Infrastructure 
Assurance Program (NCIAP) - an ongoing collaboration between private 
sector partners and federal, provincial and territorial governments 
- to provide a national framework for cooperative action and to 
build a resilient national critical infrastructure. The federal 
government classifies critical infrastructure within ten sectors, as 
opposed to the USG classification system of 17 critical 
infrastructure/key resources sectors. 
¶4.  The 10 Canadian sectors are: 
* Energy and Utilities (e.g., electrical power, natural gas, oil 
production/transmission) 
* Information and Communications Technology (e.g., 
telecommunications, broadcasting systems, software, hardware, and 
networks including the Internet) 
* Finance (e.g., large-value payment, securities clearing and 
settlement systems) 
* Health Care (e.g., hospitals, blood-supply facilities and 
pharmaceutical manufacturers) 
* Food (e.g., safety, distribution, agriculture and food industry) 
Q* Food (e.g., safety, distribution, agriculture and food industry) 
* Water (e.g., drinking water and wastewater management) 
* Transportation (e.g., road, rail, marine, and aviation) 
* Safety (e.g., chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear 
safety, dangerous goods, search and rescue, emergency services and 
dams) 
* Government (e.g., services, facilities, information networks and 
key national monuments) 
* Manufacturing (e.g., defense industrial base, chemical industry) 
Cooperation with the United States 
¶5. At the federal government level, the Public Safety Canada is 
responsible for national CI policy.  Public Safety Canada works 
primarily with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
(particularly with the Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection) 
on the identification of shared CI, threat analysis and response 
planning; since 2005, under the auspices of the SPP.  We understand 
that Public Safety Canada and DHS have recently collaborated on a 
detailed threat analysis of shared CI. Post would welcome a copy.

about 20 percent of total US agri-food imports.  In addition our two 
countries' financial markets and telecommunications and electrical

Canada's Approach to CI 
¶2. Like the United States, Canada's critical infrastructure consists 
of physical and information technology facilities, networks, 
services and assets essential to the health, safety, security or 
economic well-being of its citizens, or to the effective functioning 
of government.  In many respects, the two countries should be viewed 
as sharing the same infrastructure (pipelines, bridges, power and 
phone lines) sprawling across a shared economic space.  As in the 
United States, it is estimated that most (between 85 and 95 
percent)of Canada's critical infrastructure is owned and operated by 
private sector firms, which therefore bear primary responsibility 
for the development and implementation of business continuity plans. 
In addition to the federal government's role, the provinces and 
territories also have a significant jurisdictional role in critical 
infrastructure protection and emergency management.  These 
government entities also own and regulate some critical 
infrastructure. 
¶3. Canada has established the National Critical Infrastructure 
Assurance Program (NCIAP) - an ongoing collaboration between private 
sector partners and federal, provincial and territorial governments 
- to provide a national framework for cooperative action and to 
build a resilient national critical infrastructure. The federal 
government classifies critical infrastructure within ten sectors, as 
opposed to the USG classification system of 17 critical 
infrastructure/key resources sectors.

networks including the Internet) 
* Finance (e.g., large-value payment, securities clearing and

* Energy and Utilities (e.g., electrical power, natural gas, oil 
production/transmission) 
* Information and Communications Technology (e.g., 
telecommunications, broadcasting systems, software, hardware, and 
networks including the Internet) 
* Finance (e.g., large-value payment, securities clearing and 
settlement systems) 
* Health Care (e.g., hospitals, blood-supply facilities and 
pharmaceutical manufacturers) 
* Food (e.g., safety, distribution, agriculture and food industry) 
Q* Food (e.g., safety, distribution, agriculture and food industry) 
* Water (e.g., drinking water and wastewater management) 
* Transportation (e.g., road, rail, marine, and aviation) 
* Safety (e.g., chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear 
safety, dangerous goods, search and rescue, emergency services and 
dams) 
* Government (e.g., services, facilities, information networks and 
key national monuments) 
* Manufacturing (e.g., defense industrial base, chemical industry) 
Cooperation with the United States 
¶5. At the federal government level, the Public Safety Canada is 
responsible for national CI policy.  Public Safety Canada works 
primarily with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
(particularly with the Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection) 
on the identification of shared CI, threat analysis and response 
planning; since 2005, under the auspices of the SPP.  We understand 
that Public Safety Canada and DHS have recently collaborated on a 
detailed threat analysis of shared CI. Post would welcome a copy.

¶1. Summary: The economies, societies and environments of Canada and 
the United States are inextricably intertwined; the relationship is 
most easily reflected in the staggering volume of bilateral trade -- 
over US$1.5 billion a day in goods - and the 300,000 people who 
cross the shared border every day to work or visit.  Moreover, 
Canada is the single largest foreign supplier of fossil fuels to the 
United States (providing 17 percent of U.S. oil imports and over 80 
percent of U.S. natural gas imports).  Our food and agriculture 
markets are almost completely integrated, with Canada accounting for 
about 20 percent of total US agri-food imports.  In addition our two 
countries' financial markets and telecommunications and electrical 
networks are highly interconnected.  As a consequence of this 
exceptional interrelationship a disruption to Canada's critical 
infrastructure (CI) could have an immediate and deleterious impact 
on the United States. Because it would be virtually impossible to 
provide an exhaustive accounting of Canada's CI, this cable gives 
illustrative examples of CI in various sectors. Protection of CI is 
a Canadian national priority, and Canada is a close and trusted 
partner with the United States in working to protect CI in North 
America.  End summary. 
Canada's Approach to CI 
¶2. Like the United States, Canada's critical infrastructure consists 
of physical and information technology facilities, networks, 
services and assets essential to the health, safety, security or 
economic well-being of its citizens, or to the effective functioning 
of government.  In many respects, the two countries should be viewed 
as sharing the same infrastructure (pipelines, bridges, power and 
phone lines) sprawling across a shared economic space.  As in the 
United States, it is estimated that most (between 85 and 95 
percent)of Canada's critical infrastructure is owned and operated by 
private sector firms, which therefore bear primary responsibility 
for the development and implementation of business continuity plans. 
In addition to the federal government's role, the provinces and 
territories also have a significant jurisdictional role in critical 
infrastructure protection and emergency management.  These 
government entities also own and regulate some critical 
infrastructure. 
¶3. Canada has established the National Critical Infrastructure 
Assurance Program (NCIAP) - an ongoing collaboration between private 
sector partners and federal, provincial and territorial governments 
- to provide a national framework for cooperative action and to 
build a resilient national critical infrastructure. The federal 
government classifies critical infrastructure within ten sectors, as 
opposed to the USG classification system of 17 critical 
infrastructure/key resources sectors.
