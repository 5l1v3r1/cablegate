(SBU) Econoff delivered points in reftel to Georges Flanagan 
Whalen, Policy Advisor, International Crime and Terrorism 
Division, Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade.  Whalen said unless a name or an AKA is on the UNSCR 
1267 comittee's list, Canada has no legal basis on which to 
freeze that person's assets.  Whalen also said he is doubtful 
that Mahamedou Ould Slahi has any assets in Canada but 
promised to investigate and inform Embassy Ottawa if there 
are any assets in Slahi's name in Canada.
