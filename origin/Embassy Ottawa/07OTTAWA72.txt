REF: STATE 2945 
 
¶1. (SBU) On January 12, Economic Minister-Counselor and newly 
arrived Deputy Terrorist Financing Coordination Officer 
discussed reftel non-paper with Yves Beaulieu, Deputy 
Director for Counter-Terrorism, International Crime and 
Terrorism Division, Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT).  Beaulieu appreciated receiving 
word of the U.S. domestic designation of additional Iranian 
entities and individuals for supporting WMD proliferation and 
promised to circulate the non-paper to relevant Canadian 
agencies immediately. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Beaulieu said that DFAIT and the Department of 
Justice are in the processing of creating a new internal 
mechanism to allow the GoC to move quickly on designations 
under UNSCR 1737.  The existing mechanism is designed to act 
expeditiously on designations under UNSCR 1267 and 1373, but 
it needs modification in order to allow Ottawa to move 
equally quickly on proliferators under UNSCR 1737.  These 
changes will take a couple of weeks to arrange.  The DFAIT 
official stressed that existing law makes it mandatory for 
Canada to comply fully with UNSCRs, and therefore making 
these administrative changes is a top priority within the 
bureaucracy. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Beaulieu was especially interested in the 
non-paper's statement that the "the U.S. plans to propose the 
addition of all Iranian entities and individuals designated 
pursuant under E.O. 13382 to the Annex (of UNSCR 1737)" and 
asked when this would be done.  He noted that once the new 
entities and individuals are added to the Annex, Canada would 
be able to act in like fashion to the U.S. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Embassy political section has shared the 
non-paper with officials in DFAIT's non-proliferation office.
