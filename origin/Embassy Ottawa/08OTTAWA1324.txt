¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Canada's Conservative party won an enhanced 
minority in the October 14 federal election, increasing its 
representation in every region and province except Quebec and 
Newfoundland.  Party leaders of the four major parties all won 
re-election (although Green leader May failed to win a seat), as did 
all Conservative Cabinet ministers, except International Trade 
Minister Michael Fortier (Foreign Minister David Emerson did not run 
again).  The Liberals fell to a historic low in the popular vote, 
fuelling speculation about Stephane Dion's political future.  A low 
turn-out may have helped the incumbent party.  Septel will discuss 
the implications of the 2008 outcome.  End summary. 
 
 
Conservatives score 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In the October 14 federal election, the Conservatives 
improved their standing in the 308-seat House of Commons from 127 
MPs as of dissolution of the 39th Parliament in September to 143 MPs 
in the 40th Parliament, which will meet in November for the first 
time.  To have obtained a majority (155 seats), the Conservatives 
would have needed 29 seats and would have needed significant gains 
in Quebec.  The party managed to win ten seats in Quebec -- the same 
tally it won in 2006 -- but early hopes of doubling or tripling its 
holdings in Quebec foundered over its controversial cuts to culture 
and a tough crime platform.   The Conservatives lost their three 
seats in Newfoundland to Newfoundland premier Danny Williams' ABC 
(Anyone-But-Conservative) campaign.  Prime Minister Harper publicly 
cited new gains among female, immigrant, and urban voters. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Conservatives cut deeply into the Liberal bastion in 
rural and suburban Ontario to gain ten seats, as well as picking off 
Liberal seats in Atlantic Canada and Manitoba as well as one seat in 
Vancouver.  The Conservatives increased their popular vote by 
approximately 1 percent (38 percent) over 2006.  The Conservatives 
made significant inroads in the suburban belt around Toronto, but 
failed to win any seats -- again -- in Toronto and Montreal. 
 
Liberal woes 
------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Liberals saw their share of the popular vote fall to a 
historic low of 26 percent (from 30 percent in 2006) and their seats 
in the Commons drop to only 76, down from their 103 MPs in the 2006 
election.  Strategic voting, particularly by Green Party voters, to 
avert a Conservative majority did not appear to be a major factor. 
The Liberals nonetheless performed better than expected in Quebec, 
where they added three seats for a total of 14 in the province. 
Most commentators and many unattributed Liberal Party members 
squarely blamed the performance of Liberal leader Stephane Dion for 
this political debacle. 
 
Other parties gain 
------------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) Contrary to early expectations, the Bloc Quebecois managed 
to gain two additional two seats (one each from the Conservatives 
and Liberals) and approximately 38 percent of the provincial vote. 
Its 50 MPs give the Bloc the third largest standing in the 40th 
Parliament. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The New Democratic Party picked up seven additional seats 
(with 37 MPs in the 40th Parliament), but still short of its 
best-ever result of 43 seats in 1988.  Its share of the popular vote 
remained virtually unchanged from 2006 (18 percent compared to 17.5 
percent).  However, unlike in 2004 and 2006, the party largely held 
onto its core voters and avoided a last-minute flight of 
left-leaning voters to the Liberals.  The NDP consolidated its 
competitive position in urban Ontario and Vancouver, and added one 
new seat to the three it previously held in Atlantic Canada.  It 
Qnew seat to the three it previously held in Atlantic Canada.  It 
retained its sole seat in Quebec in the Montreal riding of Outremont 
(won in a 2007 by-election), making this the first time an NDP MP 
ever won election in Quebec in a federal election. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The Green Party increased its popular vote to 7 percent 
(up from 4.5 percent in 2006), but failed to elect any MPs, 
anywhere.  Leader Elizabeth May was a distant second to Conservative 
Defence Minister Peter Mackay in the Nova Scotia riding of Central 
Nova. 
 
Low turn-out (by Canadian standards. . .) 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Voter turn-out in the election was approximately 59 percent 
(versus 64.7 percent in 2006), apparently the lowest level since 
¶1898.  Pundits had warned that a low turn-out would help the 
incumbent party.
