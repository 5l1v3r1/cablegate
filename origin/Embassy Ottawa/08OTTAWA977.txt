REF: STATE 69644 
 
¶1.  (U)  In response to reftel demarche by PolMinCouns on 
June 30 to Director General for Africa David Angell of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 
DFAIT's Director for Eastern and Southern Africa Lisa 
Stadelbauer confirmed on July 18 that Canada "shares the 
United States' concern about the food security crisis, which 
is worsening the already precarious humanitarian situation in 
the region."  She underscored Canada's long involvement in 
the Horn of Africa and described Canada's response to the 
latest challenges: 
--  Canada has increased its support of food aid programming 
by $50 million this fiscal year, to a total of $230 million; 
--  Canada has untied restrictions on where food can be 
purchased; 
--  since December 2007, Canada has contributed over $14 
million to respond to humanitarian needs in the Horn of 
Africa, including $8 million in food aid, in addition to 
funding Canada provides to respond to general 
conflict-related needs in the region; 
--  Canada has pledged $192 million over five years to 
support the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund; 
--  since December 2007, Canada has provided nearly $12.3 
million for humanitarian assistance in Somalia, including $8 
million for food aid through WFP, $2 million to the ICRC, 
$1.4 million to Oxfam Canada and World Vision Canada, 
$500,000 to the UNHCR, and almost $400,000 to the United 
Nations Humanitarian Air Services; 
--  since December 2007, Canadian programming to Ethiopia for 
Qdrought-related responses included $1 million through UNICEF, 
$500,000 through CARE Canada, and $300,000 through Oxfam 
Canada, while Canada is now also considering its response to 
the UN Appeal for Ethiopia as well as encouraging the 
Government of Ethiopia to engage in a comprehensive 
assessment of the humanitarian implications of  the current 
drought and to engage fully with international partners 
regarding the provision of food and non-food aid; and, 
--  Canada is working with partners in the international 
community to find ways to provide practical support to the 
World Food Program's operations in Somalia in recognition of 
the urgency of the challenges WFP faces in delivering aid; 
 
¶2.  (U)  Ms. Stadelbauer added that Canada shares U.S. 
 
OTTAWA 00000977  002 OF 002 
 
 
concern about the need for greater monitoring of the 
humanitarian situation in Eritrea, but does not have a strong 
field presence there, and so cannot assist in facilitating 
relief delivery.  She pointed to the Government of Eritrea's 
largely self-imposed isolation and its interference in 
effective delivery of assistance.
