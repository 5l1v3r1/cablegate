SUBJECT: CANADA TO CONSIDER PROPOSAL TO INCREASE 
TRANSPARENCY IN EXPORT LICENSING 
 
REF: STATE 53805 
 
¶1. (SBU) Doug Rubbra, Senior Trade Policy Officer, 
Multilateral Market Access, Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade explained that the GOC initially opposed 
the U.S. sponsored proposal advocating for increased 
transparency in export licensing.  However, according to 
Rubbra the proposal is no longer as "potent" and Canada will 
now consider co-sponsoring the proposal. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Rubbra commented that because of (unspecified) 
problems with China, Canada likes the idea of increasing 
transparency in export licensing.  However, he said that it 
is not a top priority and the GOC is not sure if the Canadian 
Federal Government has the authority required to mandate that 
the Provinces abide by the agreement.
