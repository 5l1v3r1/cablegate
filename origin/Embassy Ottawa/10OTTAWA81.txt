TAGS: PREL SNAR UNCND AORC CA
SUBJECT: Canada Supports U.S. Position on Phenyl Acetic Acid at UN 
Drugs Commission 
 
REF: STATE 15387 
 
¶1. (SBU) Canada is "supportive" of U.S. efforts to tighten controls 
on phenyl acetic acid at the upcoming UN Commission on Narcotic 
Drugs (UNCND) and is willing to help in "rounding up likeminded 
countries," according to Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT) contacts.  Theresa Ladouceur, senior 
policy advisor for international narcotics affairs at DFAIT, 
underlined that Canada will be watching closely to "see how the 
final resolution shapes up," given what she described as  the 
tendency at the UNCND for resolutions to change "significantly" 
after introduction, due to amendments. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U)  Ladouceur will be part of Canada's delegation to the UNCND 
and offered to coordinate efforts with the U.S. delegation upon 
arrival.
