¶1.  (SBU) Tunisia's Ambassador to Canada, Khalifa El Hafdhi, 
demarched Charge on the forthcoming United Nations World 
Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), to be held in 
Tunisia from November 16-18.  Ambassador El Hafdhi briefly 
reviewed the background of the WSIS, noting that phase I of 
the WSIS had been held in Geneva, and emphasizing the 
international visibility this conference will have for 
Tunisia.  In this regard, he inquired on the possibility of 
whether a short reference to the WSIS could be included in 
the final statement from next month's G-8 summit in Scotland. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Charge thanked the Ambassador, and advised him that 
his request would be forwarded to Washington for further 
consideration.  Ambassador El Hafdhi indicated that the 
Tunisian Embassy in Washington would also raise this item 
directly with the Department.
