SUBJECT:  NSDD 38 - NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE 
ADMINISTRATION (NASA) STAFFING IN SAINT-HUBERT, CANADA 
 
STATE 04 222849 
 
¶1.  I concur with the proposal set forth in reftel to 
abolish the NASA USDH International Space Station Technical 
Liaison position in Saint-Hubert, Canada.  Per reftel, the 
NASA FSN position remains in order to support regularly 
scheduled TDY travel to Canada by NASA officials. 
 
¶2.  According to reftel, the last ISS Technical Liaison was 
recalled on September 20, 2004.  While the work of the NASA 
FSN employee may have increased with the departure of the 
USDH employee, the workload of embassy and Montreal 
consulate DOS employees has not been affected. Further, the 
proposal to abolish this position will have no impact on the 
Mission's goals and objectives as stated in the MPP.
