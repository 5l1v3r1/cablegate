¶1. (SBU) On January 26 Environment Canada Assistant Deputy 
Minister for International Affairs David McGovern reviewed 
for ESTH Counselor Canada's strategy and recent efforts in 
support of its bid for membership in the Asia Pacific 
Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP).  McGovern 
said Canada had decided the best way to demonstrate the 
seriousness of its intent was to ensure it had funding for 
APP activities before it formally requested admission to the 
partnership.  The next time it engaged in serious discussions 
with APP partners, McGovern expected Canada would be able "to 
put its money on the table." 
 
¶2. (SBU) McGovern continued that the internal "paperwork" and 
approvals needed to secure the funding was nearly complete. 
He hoped final Cabinet approval would be in hand next month 
and that funding for APP for up to four years would be 
available beginning at the start of the Canadian fiscal year 
on April 1. 
 
¶3. (SBU) McGovern confirmed that Environment Canada had been 
talking with the other APP partners and pressing Canada's 
case for membership.  Former Environment Minister Rona 
Ambrose, for example, had discussions with her counterparts 
from APP partners at the UNFCCC COP 12 in Nairobi last 
November, and officials had also consulted with their APP 
counterparts.  McGovern related that Environment Canada had 
heard from others, including the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade, that neither China nor India 
would likely support expansion of APP at this time. 
Environment Canada had been pleasantly surprised: while India 
"wouldn't engage," in McGovern's words, China reacted 
"relatively positively."  McGovern stressed his appreciation 
for strong USG support for Canada's bid to join the APP.
