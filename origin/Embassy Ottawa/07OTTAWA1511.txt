¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche to Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade Deputy Director for 
Nuclear Non-proliferation Craig Weichel on August 1, and 
followed-up twice thereafter. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Weichel told us on August 8 that he expected GOC 
technical experts would not/not view the sale as an 
"undercut" but that, due to summer staffing constraints, he 
did not expect to be in a position to give a definitive 
response to our query for at least another week (septel).
