¶1. (U) ESTH discussed U.S. candidacy for position of 
vice-chair on the UNAIDS Program Coordinating Board (PCB) for 
the 2007-08 cycle with representatives of the Foreign 
Ministry (DFAIT) and provided the demarche to Health 
Canada,s International Affairs group.  We are seeking to 
discuss our interest in the position also with the Canadian 
International Development Agency, which actually leads on 
UNAIDS for the GOC. 
 
¶2. (SBU) DFAIT reports that Canada, since they are not on the 
PCB, would not put forth a candidate for the position.  Our 
interlocutors continued that U.S. candidacy appears 
appropriate and there appears no reason they would not 
support our candidacy, even though Canada does not 
technically have a "vote."  Our DFAIT contacts were aware 
that other countries might be interested but did not express 
their views on other possible canadidates. 
 
¶3. (SBU) While Canada seems to be favorably disposed towards 
the U.S. candidacy (believing, for example, that it is the 
turn of a non-European donor to take the position), we will 
continue to follow up with CIDA and DFAIT and report as 
additional information becomes available.
