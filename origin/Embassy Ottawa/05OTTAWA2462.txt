¶1. (C) Polmiloff met with Director of North American and 
Euro-Atlantic Security and Defence Relations Division (IDR) 
Director Barbara Martin and staff on August 11 to discuss 
renewal of ISAF,s mandate.  Though Canada has not started to 
examine the matter in detail (NOTE: summer cottage season is 
in full swing and Assistant Deputy Jim Wright is on leave 
until 01 September. END NOTE), Martin welcomed USG's 
initiative to consult as a timely "heads-up" for the GOC to 
begin internal deliberations.  She reaffirmed Canada's 
support for integration of CFC-A and ISAF and volunteered 
that in general discussions this summer, she and UK 
counterparts found that the UK and Canada share the concerns 
articulated in reftel message.  Martin mused that it might be 
useful to hold preliminary consultations among like-minded 
Allies. 
 
¶2. (C) Martin said her British interlocutors were concerned 
not to provide a forum in which opponents of integration 
could advance their agenda.  Canada and the UK had discussed 
how to minimize or circumvent opportunities to undermine 
integration in the ISAF renewal process.  One approach, she 
offered, might be to encourage President Karzai to write a 
letter to UNSYG Annan requesting renewal ofthe ISAF mandate. 
Post will monitor the progress of Canada's internal 
deliberations and report back as appropriate.
