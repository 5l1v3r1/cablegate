Â¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel demarche, Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) Deputy 
Director for Defence and Security Relations Anne Burgess said 
that Canada was "ready to support" the proposed increase in 
the size of the Afghan National Army fighting force from 
80,000 to 122,000.  Burgess stressed that Canada would expect 
the enlargement to result in the deployment at least one 
additional Kandak to join the Canadian Forces (CF) in
