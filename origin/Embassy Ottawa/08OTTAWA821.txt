(U) On June 17, Econoff delivered points in reftel to Ivan 
Roberts, A/Director, Canadian International Development 
Agency, Gulf of Guinea Division.  Roberts said that Canada 
has not had a bilateral aid relationship with Liberia in 
recent years.  Canada has offered assistance to Liberia 
through multilateral platforms, however.  Roberts explained 
that the GOC is currently reducing the number of its 
international assistance programs in order to better focus on 
larger more successful programs.  In this environment, he 
said, it is unlikely that Canada will start an aid program to 
Liberia.  Roberts said that the Canadian representative at 
the Liberia Poverty Reduction Forum in Berlin will likely be 
from the Canadian Embassy in Berlin, but the final decision 
has not yet been made.
