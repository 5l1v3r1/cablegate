 ¶1.  (SBU)  In a discussion with PolMinCouns on November 5, 
Ben Rowswell, Manager of the Democracy Unit in the Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), expressed 
appreciation for reftel views on the upcoming 4th Community 
of Democracies Ministerial in Bamako.  He said that 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Deepak Obhrai (Member of Parliament from the ruling 
Conservative Party) would lead the delegation, accompanied by 
Liberal MP Mark Eyking, the Canadian Ambassador in Mali, and 
a DFAIT Deputy Director General.  The Canadians generally 
support the draft declaration and share our views on the 
importance of democratic governance and rule of law as well 
as the vital role of NGOs and civil society.  (He noted that 
the Canadian Ambassador in Caracas had even recently 
persuaded the Venezuelan government to back down on proposed 
new restrictions on NGOs there.)  At the invitation of the 
Government of Mali, the Canadians will chair a discussion on 
the Americas, but do not at present plan to raise Cuba or 
Venezuela directly.  Rowswell promised to make sure Obhrai 
was at least aware of U.S. hopes that Canada and other 
participants do discuss the state of democracy or lack 
thereof in these countries at this meeting. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Rowswell noted that the Canadians plan to cite as 
an example of tangible programs their funding for a new 
handbook for diplomats (ref b).  They look forward to 
discussions in Bamako about the Asia Pacific Democracy 
Partnership, but Foreign Minister Bernier has not yet 
formally accepted the DFAIT recommendation that Canada join. 
On the UN Democracy Caucus, Rowswell cited its 
"heterogeneity" as a limitation on real effectiveness, while 
noting that it still had the potential to serve as a useful 
forum between the G-77 and the North.  Canada is awaiting 
assessments due in February or March about the initial 
programs of the UN Democracy Fund before making decisions 
about future funding.  DFAIT will also look into the 
possibility of funding from either DFAIT or CIDA for the CD 
Secretariat; Rowswell expressed appreciation for the generous 
 
SIPDIS 
USG contributions to this over the past year and a half.
