¶1. Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
(DFAIT)  in a telephone conversation on August 3, informed the 
Embassy that the Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker Louis St. Laurent 
is proceeding to the disputed area of the Beaufort Sea where its 
crew will conduct seismic studies over the next few weeks.  These 
studies will be used to support Canada's forthcoming claim to extend 
its sovereignty over the seabed and subsurface to the edge of the 
continental shelf, as per UNCLOS Article 77 (see Ref A for details). 
 
 
¶2. Tyler Cummings of DFAIT's U.S. relations division told Emboff 
that as Canada contends that this area of the Beaufort Sea is in 
their possession, Canada will not be making a formal "Application 
for Consent to Conduct Marine Scientific Research" and that 
informing us was being done simply as a courtesy of the GoC to the 
USG.  Cummings indicated that when American flag vessels have 
conducted research in this disputed zone that the USG has likewise 
provided a verbal "head's up" to Canada but that no formal 
documentation has been exchanged.
