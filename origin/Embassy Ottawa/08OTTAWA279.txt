SUBJECT: CANADA TO MEET IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION PLEDGE 
 
¶1. (SBU) According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade, Canada is well on track to provide the 
CAD 300 million (approximately USD 295.39 million, at the 
current exchange rate) it pledged in 2003 to provide for Iraq 
reconstruction through 2010.  As of September 2007, Canada 
already had provided CAD 282.5 million (USD 280.06 million), 
or approximately 94 percent of its pledge, as below: 
 
Basic social and economic needs: CAD 108.5 million (USD 
106.83 million) 
Humanitarian assistance: CAD 50.5 million (USD 49.72 million) 
Governance: CAD 97.8 million (USD 96.30 million) 
Security sector reform: CAD 17.5 million (USD 17.23 million) 
Regional democratic development: CAD 7.8 million (USD 7.68 
million) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  The Canadian International Development 
Agency is now in the process of considering its programming 
for Iraqi reconstruction after 2010, although future 
assistance is likely to be nowhere near the level of Canada's 
2003 pledge.  Canada has met its commitments and also found 
creative ways to assist Iraq with police and justice 
training, elections support, diplomatic training, and 
technical constitution-drafting assistance, among other 
areas.  While the overall levels may go down, Canada will 
remain an active partner in Iraqi reconstruction.
