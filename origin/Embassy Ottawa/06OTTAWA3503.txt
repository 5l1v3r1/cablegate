SUBJECT: SANTA CRUZ MINISTERIAL ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
DEMARCHE: CANADIAN RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 191887 
 
 ¶1. (U) On November 30, Economic Minister presented reftel 
demarche conveying U.S. views on the Santa Cruz  Ministerial 
on Sustainable Development at the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) to an inter-agency 
group headed by Leonard Beaulne, Deputy Director (Policy), 
Brazil, Southern Cone, and Inter-American Relations Division, 
DFAIT.  Some on Canada's Santa Cruz delegation participated 
in the meeting. 
 
¶2. (U) Based on the group's reaction, the GoC appears to 
support the thrust of our demarche.  Canada agrees that the 
Santa Cruz Declaration should be pruned back to focus on a 
few essential elements.  Last minute additions to the draft, 
such as on climate change, are problematic.  The Canadians 
believe that the Latin Americans do not agree among 
themselves about the scientific evidence on climate change. 
If it is eventually decided that the issue must be added to 
the Declaration for political reasons, the GoC believes that 
the relevant language should be neutral and factual. 
Environment Canada suggested that previous agreed upon 
climate change language in a G-8 statement might be the 
source for acceptable language around which a consensus could 
form.  Canada completely agrees that the Santa Cruz meeting 
must also approve the OAS's Integrated Program on Sustainable 
Development (PIDS).  The Canadian delegation looks forward to 
working closely with the US delegation during the final 
Declaration drafting process in Santa Cruz.  Several ruefully 
anticipate participating in all-night drafting sessions. 
 
¶3. (U) Canada's delegation will be headed by its Ambassador 
to the OAS, Graeme Clark, and includes staff from DFAIT, 
National Resources Canada, Parks Canada, Environment Canada, 
and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).
