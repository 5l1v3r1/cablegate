¶1. (SBU) EconMinCouns delivered points in ref A to Paul 
Robertson, Director General, North America Trade Policy 
Bureau, Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade.  DG Robertson said that the GOC understands U.S. 
concerns very well.  Declining to answer questions about when 
and how Canada intends to improve IPR protection, Robertson 
referred to Prime Minister Harper's April 23 letter to 
Ambassador Wilkins (Ref B) saying that he (Robertson) "can 
not be more specific than the Prime Minister."  Doug George, 
Director of the Intellectual Property, Information and 
Technology Trade Division was equally vague.  He said that, 
as he explained in his testemony to Parliment on April 25, 
the interagency working group on border enforcement, which he 
chairs, has been working hard for over two years but has no 
definite target date for releasing their recommendations. 
 
¶2. (SBU) DG Robertson noted that U.S. Trade Representative 
Schwab will be in Ottawa on May 9 and 10 and said that the 
GOC expects IPR to be one of the major issues of this visit. 
He said that all of the Ministers that she meets with will be 
fully briefed on IPR.  Robertson also stated that Minister of 
Industry Bernier, who has previously offered estimates of 
when Canada's new copyright bill would be inroduced in 
Parliment, might be in a position to provide an updated 
estimate.  (Comment: Bernier has made several previous 
estimates to the Ambassador and other high ranking USG 
officials.  All of the target dates, the earliest of which 
was last fall, have passed and the bill has not yet been 
introduced. End Comment.)
