digital videoconference on May 2nd to select Canada's slate 
of nominees for the FY 2006 program.  The twenty-eight 
 
principal candidates and twelve alternates represent 
emerging leaders from all of Canada's consular districts, 
from seven provinces and territories, from government, 
media, law enforcement, think tanks, higher education 
institutions, corporations, and non-profit organizations. 
Eleven of the principal twenty-eight candidates are visible 
minorities, twelve are women. Their proposed programs will 
support six priority Mission Performance Plan priorities.

cables in EVDB format.  The post looks forward to 
collaborating with ECA/PE/V colleagues to offer them the 
kind of up-close, stimulating and balanced experience in the 
United States that has given past grantees a multi- 
dimensional, richer view of the United States.

A)  Current Economic, Political, Security and Social Issues 
 
This proposed project, for provincial and municipal 
politicians and political aides, representing several 
parties, would develop grantees' understanding of the 
workings of the U.S. political and economic policy-making 
system; federal/state/local relations; 
legislative/executive/judicial checks and balances; U.S. 
policies and public views on security and defense; 
international trade policies, especially those that affect 
Canada; health care and social security debates; energy 
policy; and environmental protection and conservation.  The 
project would be structured so that grantees participate in 
10 days of common programming, then split into smaller 
groups to pursue specific interests in the remaining 5 
program days. 
 
Proposed group members: 
 
--Yolanda James, Member of Quebec Legislative Assembly 
(Liberal); 
--Paul Black Research Officer, Office of the Leader of the 
Opposition, Government of Nova Scotia (New Democratic 
Party);

Parliament Belinda Stronach (recent Liberal); 
--Arnold Chan, Executive Assistant to the Premier of Ontario 
(Liberal); 
--Craig Ryan, Chief of Staff, Office of the Mayor of 
Winnipeg 
 
B)  Ground Transportation Safety and Planning 
 
This project would better acquaint two players involved in 
supporting Canada-U.S. trade via truck to overall U.S. 
security policies, U.S. border security concerns, regulation 
and implementation, including both northern and southern 
borders, ground transportation safety measures, 
 
infrastructure planning and funding, and broader border

bioterrorism countermeasures, and marine security 
cooperation. 
 
Nominees: 
 
--Stephen Laskowski, Assistant Vice President, Ontario 
Trucking Association; 
--Robert Kroeker, Director of Commercial Vehicle Safety, 
British Columbia Ministry of Solicitor General 
 
C)  Infrastructure Development and Protection 
 
This project would focus on the political, financial, 
environmental, and social aspects of infrastructure 
development in urban areas and at key U.S. border crossings. 
One nominee is a public sector manager, the other a business 
association leader.  The program would emphasize the 
positive interaction between the public and private sectors 
in the United States to identify priorities, stimulate 
investment, and implement infrastructure projects that 
support economic growth, safety and well-being of citizens. 
 
Nominees: 
 
--David Morley, Senior Policy Advisor, Office of the 
Minister of State for Infrastructure and Communities, 
Ottawa;

environmental issues) 
 
This project would acquaint two first-term Members of the 
Canadian Parliament to the policy-making system in the 
United States, through discussions with federal, state and 
local government leaders and officials, experts, lobbyists,

economic and environmental issues that matter in the U.S.- 
Canada relationship.  Specific topics will be determined in 
consultation with invitees, once approved. 
 
Nominees: 
 
--Navdeep BAINS, Member of Canadian Parliament (Liberal) 
--Nathan CULLEN, Member of Canadian Parliament (New

communities with U.S. ideals and practice in celebrating the 
diversity of our society.  Themes might include immigration 
policy and integration of new immigrants; business 
development among minorities and government policies in 
support of women- and minority-owned businesses; education 
and training opportunities for minorities; integration and 
language issues in schools; promotion of diversity in the 
workplace; the Haitian-American community and its role in 
aiding Haiti; African-American community leadership and 
culture; US promotion of religious tolerance and freedom at 
home and abroad; cultural institutions celebrating 
indigenous people, immigrants, and minorities.

F)  U.S. Public Policy Issues and the Broadcast Media 
 
This program would acquaint two emerging broadcast 
journalists with major public policy debates in the U.S. and 
how they are covered in the broadcast media.  Through 
meetings with federal executive, legislative and judicial 
branches, state and local governments, NGOs, industry and 
professional associations, and naturally, their counterparts 
in U.S. media organizations, they would gain insights into 
how the differing views of Americans merge in the policy- 
making process.  Specific issues on which they might focus 
include U.S. Homeland Security (e.g. balancing security 
measures with privacy and civil liberties concerns); U.S. 
Trade Policy (e.g. commitment to free trade, positions on 
agricultural trade distortions in world markets, U.S. trade 
remedies as applied to Canada-U.S. softwood, wheat and hog 
trade); Energy and Environmental Policy (respective 
contributions of energy companies, auto companies, 
alternative energy researchers and producers, nuclear power 
proponents, conservationists, public utilities, and NGOs), 
Prescription Drug Trade, or the Social Security Debate.
