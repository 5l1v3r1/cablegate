SUBJECT: CANADA WELCOMES COMMERCIAL, NOT GOVERNMENTAL, 
TALKS ON EXTRACTION OF HELIUM-3 
 
REF: STATE 69767 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Government of Canada would welcome USG 
discussions with Canadian commercial entities regarding 
extraction of Helium-3 for the purposes outlined in reftel, 
according to Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) Deputy Director for International Nuclear 
Cooperation Shawn Caza.  Caza underlined, however, that 
relevant Canadian federal agencies see no governmental role 
in any commercial discussions between the USG and Canadian 
suppliers in what the GOC views as a "straight up" commercial 
transaction.  He counseled that USG interlocutors should 
focus their efforts on discussions with Ontario Power in 
particular.  He added that Canadian officials would 
nevertheless be willing to meet with U.S. officials during 
the trip, but that the decision to proceed would rest 
exclusively with the commercial entity. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Caza commented that the senior management of Ontario 
Power is "clearly interested" in pursuing discussions with 
USG officials on Helium-3 extraction.  Ontario Power's prime 
concern, according to Caza, would be the unique nature of our 
request and an unfamiliarity with the process of Helium-3 
extraction.  He stressed that Ontario Power's paramount 
concern is that this contemplated side venture not interfere 
with its regular commercial operations.  He observed that 
Ontario Power would look for a "turnkey operation" and would 
have no interest in developing an extraction capability on 
its own.  If the USG were to offer such a business solution 
to Ontario Power, it would also preclude the need to launch a 
public tender process, according to Caza.
