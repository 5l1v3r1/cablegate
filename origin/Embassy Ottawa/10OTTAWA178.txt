SUBJECT: CANADA: SECOND LIFE SENTENCE FOR ANOTHER TERRORIST 
 
REF: TORONTO 62; TORONTO 54; TORONTO 38 
 
¶1.  (U)  A Quebec court in Montreal on February 17 laid down a life 
sentence for Moroccan-born Said Namouh on a charge of conspiracy to 
detonate an explosive device, on which he had been convicted in 
October 2009.  The court at the same time gave him concurrent 
sentences of four, eight, and eight years for other convictions in 
the same case --participating in a terrorist act, facilitating an 
act of terrorism, and committing extortion for a terrorist group 
(the Global Islamic Media Front).   The judge described Namouh as 
"very dangerous" and "remorseless," and contrasted him specifically 
with some other convicted terrorists in the Toronto 18 case who 
received notably lighter sentences (refs a and b).   However, one 
of the Toronto 18 - ringleader Zakaria Amara -       had received 
the first life sentence under Canada's anti-terrorism legislation 
on January 18 in Toronto (ref c). 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U)  Namouh moved to Canada in 2003 and is a landed immigrant 
married to a Quebec woman.  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
arrested him in rural Quebec in September 2007.  He had prepared a 
ransom video for the Army of Islam after it kidnapped BBC reporter 
Alan Johnston in Gaza in March 2007.  Canadian officials discovered 
evidence on his computer of plans to set off explosions in Germany 
or Austria.   Citing Namouh's address to the court at his 
sentencing hearing in November 2009, the judge concluded that "in 
no way since the events has he distanced himself from terrorism," 
and he accused Namouh of "manipulating the court." 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U)  Namouh will become eligible for parole in 2017, ten years 
after his initial arrest under Canadian regulations.  The 
government has reportedly begun deportation hearings.  The 
prosecutor in the case commented that this life sentence 
demonstrates to would-be terrorists that "you cannot come into 
Canada to carry out a plot here or elsewhere.  We are not a safe 
haven." 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U)  Comment:  this second life sentence for a convicted 
terrorist in Canada is welcome news in Canada's counter-terrorism 
efforts, and belies the reputation for leniency that Canadian 
courts have sometimes earned.
