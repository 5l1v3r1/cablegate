Begin text 
 
Thank you very much for the invitation to the Friends of Iraq 
Conference in Abu Dhabi.  The Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade (DFAIT) will not be sending a senior 
representative to this conference. 
 
Canada remains committed to working with Iraq's neighbors and 
the international community to help the Iraqi people rebuild 
their lives.  A secure, stable, and democratic Iraq is 
essential for regional peace and prosperity.  In this regard, 
international support and regional cooperation are vital 
components of the efforts to end violence in Iraq and to 
prevent the spread of instability in the region.

¶2. (SBU) Separately, the Department of National Defense also 
confirmed that it would not send a representative to the 
conference, under instruction from DFAIT. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Iraq remains a controversial issue for 
Canada, which prefers to focus more on its active military 
and humanitarian role in Afghanistan.  Canada nonetheless 
remains a generous donor to Iraq's reconstruction and 
development, and will continue to provide this support for 
the foreseeable future.
