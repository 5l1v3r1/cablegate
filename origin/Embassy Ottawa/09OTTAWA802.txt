1.(U)  Summary: Canada welcomes the UN Office of Drugs and 
Crime as an observer to the Global Initiative to Combat 
Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT), recognizing the connections of 
UNODC,s work to that of GICNT.  Canada will be represented 
at the November 2009 Exercise Planning Group (EPG), although 
its available national exercise capacity is limited.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  POLMILOFF, in conjunction with the Political 
Counselor from the Russian Embassy, delivered ref a message 
to David McDuff, Senior Policy Officer in the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Division of the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade (DFAIT).  McDuff was aware of proposals to 
accord observer status to the UNODC, and agreed that UNODC,s 
work has important connections to the goals of GICNT.  He 
confirmed that Canada welcomes UNODC as an observer. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  McDuff expressed a desire to know more about 
broader U.S. planning related to non-proliferation in light 
of the President's April 5 address in Prague.  He wondered 
specifically what connection there might be between GICNT and 
the Nuclear Security Summit (NSS).  Given that GICNT is an 
existing structure, McDuff posited that it might serve as a 
platform through which to deliver outcomes of the NSS. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  With regard to the November EPG, McDuff confirmed 
that Canada would send representatives, but said that he was 
not yet certain whether the officials would be from DFAIT 
headquarters or the Canadian Embassy in Budapest, due to 
budgetary limitations.  McDuff asked for more information 
concerning  plans for the exercise program in general.  He 
cautioned that Canada's domestic exercise capacity is 
&tapped out8 with preparations for the 2010 Winter Olympics 
in British Columbia and the 2010 G8 and G20 Summits in 
Ontario.  He nonetheless noted the desire within DFAIT to 
remain abreast of developments and to be as supportive as 
possible of the exercise program.  He urged that GICNT build 
on previous exercises and integrate the efforts of the 
partner nations more broadly.
