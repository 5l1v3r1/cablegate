¶1. (SBU) The health NGO Operation Eyesight Universal Foundation 
(OEUF) is well known and highly regarded in Canada.  USAID's 
Canadian counterpart, the Canadian International Development Agency 
(CIDA), cites OEUF as having been a key partner for more than thirty 
years.  The 2007 OEUF annual report indicates that the 
organization's expansion into Canada was at CIDA's behest so that 
the CIDA could channel aid more effectively to vision projects 
abroad.  At the sub-national level, OEUF fundraising projects have 
been initiated and supported by individual Canadians, charitable 
foundations, and community service groups (such as Rotary and Lions) 
across the country. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Although a comprehensive review of OEUF board members is 
not possible within the scope of this research, a survey of public 
media suggests the board comprises 'who's who' of the Canadian 
philanthropic community with ties.
