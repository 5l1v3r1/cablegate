¶1.  US Office Pristina welcomes and grants country clearance to 
Representative David Dreier, Chairman - House Rules Committee, Brad 
Smith, Professional Staff Member and LTC Paul Kennedy, Lead Military 
Planner, to visit Pristina November 23, 2006.  The purpose of the 
visit is to conduct meetings with Parliamentarians and staff in 
conjunction with the purpose of the House Democracy Assistance 
Commission. Logistical Control Officer for this visit will be 
Management Officer Bob Ruehle, who can be reached at: office 
381-38-549-516 ext. 3233; GSM 377-44-502-115; fax 381-38-549-890. 
Control Officer for Kosovo Assembly meetings will be Political 
Officer AJ Rei-Perrine, who can be reached at: office 381-38-549-516 
ext. 3195 ; GSM 377-44-500-972; fax 381-38-549-890. 
 
¶2.  Kosovo is a cash (Euro) economy.  There are a few operating 
ATMs. A few large stores and some hotels take credit cards.  Not all 
ATMS are reliable and personnel should use normal ATM safety 
precautions.  TDY personnel should bring sufficient cash or 
travelers' checks to cover all hotel and other incidental expenses 
and may exchange dollars for Euros from 9:00am-11:30am and 
1:00pm-3:30pm each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday and 
9:00am-11:30am each Thursday at the U.S. Office cashier.  Only USOP 
accepts travelers' checks.   Reverse accommodation is available at 
the end of the visit. 
 
¶3.  Security issues:  The security situation in Kosovo is fluid and 
there is still risk from occasional episodes of violence; incidents 
of ethnic violence continue to occur.  Land mines remain in some 
outlying areas.  Civil society institutions generally do not yet 
meet Western standards.  There is criminal activity against 
internationals, including purse snatching and residential break-ins 
and general precautions are recommended.  KFOR is deployed 
throughout Kosovo.  Electronic devices such as laptops (personal or 
official), PDA cell phones with cameras, and the like must be 
approved for use in USOP facilities by an ISSO in consultation with 
the RSO. 
 
¶4. Travel to certain areas within Kosovo province requires fully 
armored vehicles and advance RSO approval.  To facilitate planning, 
please provide travel itinerary to USOP in advance of arrival, as 
same-day travel can be difficult to arrange.  To provide appropriate 
access to USOP facilities, visitors must ensure all necessary 
security clearances are included with travel messages. 
 
¶5. Please ensure ASEC tags are included to ensure proper 
distribution.  Specific questions regarding security may be 
addressed to USOP's RSO or your control officer.
