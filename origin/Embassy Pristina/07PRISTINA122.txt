¶1.  US Office Pristina welcomes and grants country clearance to Kyle 
Cunningham to visit Pristina February 28 - March 1, 2007.  The 
purpose of the visit is to interview Cochran candidates. Control 
Officer for this visit will be Commercial Assistant, Fatmir Morina, 
who can be reached at: office 381-38-549-516 ext. 3183; GSM 
377-44-500-784; fax 381-38-549-890. 
 
¶2.  Post will coordinate arrangements for border transfers with 
Belgrade and Skopje.  Post will also coordinate arrangements for 
transportation for official meetings during the visit. 
Accommodations have been confirmed at Hotel Ambassador.  Room rate 
is 75 euros a night, including breakfast, internet, mini bar - four 
drinks daily.  The hotel accepts cash and credit cards.  Please note 
that there is an extra charge of 4% if paying by credit card. 
 
¶3.  Kosovo is a cash (Euro) economy.  There are a few operating 
ATMs. A few large stores and some hotels take credit cards.  Not all 
ATMS are reliable and personnel should use normal ATM safety 
precautions.  TDY personnel should bring sufficient cash or 
travelers' checks to cover all hotel and other incidental expenses 
and may exchange dollars for Euros from 9:00am-11:30am and 
1:00pm-3:30pm each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday and 
9:00am-11:30am each Thursday at the U.S. Office cashier.  Only USOP 
accepts travelers' checks.   Reverse accommodation is available at 
the end of the visit. 
 
¶4.  Security issues:  The security situation in Kosovo is fluid and 
there is still risk from occasional episodes of violence; incidents 
of ethnic violence continue to occur.  Land mines remain in some 
outlying areas.  Civil society institutions generally do not yet 
meet Western standards.  There is criminal activity against 
internationals, including purse snatching and residential break-ins 
and general precautions are recommended.  KFOR is deployed 
throughout Kosovo.  Electronic devices such as laptops (personal or 
official), PDA cell phones with cameras, and the like must be 
approved for use in USOP facilities by an ISSO in consultation with 
the RSO. 
 
¶5. Travel to certain areas within Kosovo province requires fully 
armored vehicles and advance RSO approval.  To facilitate planning, 
please provide travel itinerary to USOP in advance of arrival, as 
same-day travel can be difficult to arrange.  To provide appropriate 
access to USOP facilities, visitors must ensure all necessary 
security clearances are included with travel messages. 
 
¶6. Please ensure ASEC tags are included to ensure proper 
distribution.  Specific questions regarding security may be 
addressed to USOP's RSO or your control officer.
