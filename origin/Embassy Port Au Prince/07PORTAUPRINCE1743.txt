¶1. (U) Reftel points were discussed October 26 with Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs Director of International Organizations 
Azad Belfort.  Belfort told Poloff that Haiti enjoys good 
relations with Cuba.  He noted that Cuba has provided 
assistance to Haiti in a number of areas, including health. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In response to the request that Haiti vote against 
the Cuba Embargo Resolution or at minimum abstain, Belfort 
countered that Haiti typically votes consistent with 
decisions made by the Latin American and Caribbean Group of 
Countries (GRULAC), of which Cuba is a member. He expected 
that Haiti would vote with the UNGA majority on the 
Resolution. 
 
¶3. (U) Belfort indicated he would share the points discussed 
with Minister of Foreign Affairs Jean Renald Clerisme and 
would highlight the export figures presented.  Belfort said 
he was surprised the U.S. exports ranked so highly compared 
to other Cuba trading partners.  (Note:  It may be important 
to present greater detail on the amount and constitution of 
U.S. exports to Cuba in discussions regarding the Embargo and 
in future demarches.  End Note.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) While Belfort agreed to communicate the U.S. 
position on the Embargo Resolution to Minister Clerisme, he 
characterized the USG request as ''delicate'' given the 
cooperative relationship Haiti has with Cuba and the fact 
that both countries participate in regional bodies designed 
to promote political and economic cooperation.  Despite 
Post's representation of reftel points to the MFA, post 
considers it doubtful that Haiti will vote against the 
Embargo Resolution.
