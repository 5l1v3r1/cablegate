¶1.       (SBU) On February 22, Reuters reported the Government of 
Haiti had halted food and water deliveries to internally displaced 
persons (IDP's) in a camp on the grounds of the prime minister's 
office, the Primature.  The GOH was reportedly trying to pressure 
IDPs to abandon the Primature grounds and relocate to the Tabarre 
section of the capital.  Post confirmed local government officials 
had restored electricity to the Primature IDP camp; and one month's 
food rations were distributed.  Conditions remain challenging, 
however, and one resident reported full latrines and people 
purchasing water from trucks to bathe. 
 
 
 
¶2.       (SBU) Since the earthquake, the GOH has been encouraging 
people whose homes were destroyed to move outside of Port au 
Prince.  The GOH has been seeking to avoid providing incentives for 
people to remain in Port au Prince, such as building permanent IDP 
camps, thereby allowing it to focus on reconstruction efforts in 
the capitol (reftel). 
 
 
 
¶3.       (SBU) Comment: The GOH is looking to meet the needs of 
IDP's without creating incentives for people to remain in the 
capital.  They are also trying slowly but surely to move IDP camps 
to appropriate locations away from public buildings like the 
Primature and the downtown main plaza at Champ de Mars.  End 
Comment.
