SUBJECT: PARLIAMENT RATIFIED PETROCARIBE AGREEMENT 08/29 
 
REF: A. PAP 856 
     ¶B. PAP 1377 
     ¶C. PAP 1598 
 
¶1.  Parliament ratified the PetroCaribe agreement during a 
session of the national assembly, which included 19 of 27 
senators and 47 of 88 deputies.  53 voted in favor and 13 
abstained; no parliamentarians voted against ratification. 
The agreement, signed by President Rene Preval and Venezuelan 
Vice President Jose Vincente Rangel on Preval's inauguration 
day (ref A), was read out loud followed by commentary on the 
document.  Several parliamentarians spoke in favor of 
ratification citing resultant increases in government 
revenues.  (The GOH plans to resell gasoline provided under 
the agreement to local suppliers at market prices and keep 
the difference.)  Notably, all appeared to understand that 
PetroCaribe would not lower the price of petroleum in Haiti, 
currently at around US $5 per gallon at the pump.  The local 
news today reports the passage of the PetroCaribe agreement, 
stating only the facts of the vote, with little commentary or 
media fanfare. 
 
¶2.  Comment: Despite this obvious step forward for 
PetroCaribe agreement, Haiti still has many kinks to work out 
before the program is fully implemented.  As the Ambassador 
has stressed to Haitian officials, transportation and 
insurance costs, as well as storage and distribution of the 
petroleum are only several of many obstacles.  The GOH 
finally sold, in mid-August, the first and only petroleum 
shipment, which arrived May 13 (ref B), and there is no news 
of a second shipment yet.  Because Haiti has a relatively low 
petroleum demand -- around 11,000 barrels per day -- and 
PetroCaribe has offered to supply up to 6000 barrels per day, 
the agreement could have a considerable effect on the 
petroleum industry in Haiti.  Post will continue to send 
updates as appropriate.
