SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: SAMOA GRADUATION FROM ECOSOC 
LDC LIST 
 
REF: SECSTATE 54163 
 
The foreign ministry's director of political affairs Weiner 
Jean Baptiste agreed that Samoa should adhere to the Economic 
and Social Council's (ECOSOC) graduation process.  If not, 
the least developed countries (LDC) list loses its 
credibility, and countries like Haiti that should be 
recognized for their "severe structural handicaps" do not get 
the attention they deserve and need.  Jean Baptiste agreed 
that Samoa should embrace graduation and said that he hoped 
to see Haiti graduate from the LDC list one day.  Jean 
Baptiste, apparently unsure of Haiti's position is the past, 
said that he would discuss the issue with the GoH 
representative in New York in advance of the vote, now 
scheduled to be held sometime in late May.
