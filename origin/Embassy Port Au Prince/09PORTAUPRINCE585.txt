SUBJECT: EMBASSY PORT-AU-PRINCE, EAC MEETING - JUNE 18, 2009

¶1.  (SBU) On June 18, 2009, Post's core Emergency Action
Committee (EAC) group was convened by Charge Thomas C. Tighe.
 Representatives from the following offices attended: DAO,
CONS, POL, ECON, NAS, CGLO, MLO, GRPO, USAID and MGT. The EAC
met to discuss recent security-related events in
Port-au-Prince.

¶2.  (SBU) The EAC discussed various threats stemming from:
(a) the funeral proceedings today of Father Gerard Jean-Juste
who is well known for his political association with the
Fanmi Lavalas political party (former President Arisitide's
political party); (b) the fatal shooting of a bystander
outside the cathedral where the Jean-Juste funeral was being
held and the subsequent rioting that occurred; and (c) the
so-called "minimum wage" violent demonstrations (which also
came to include anti-U.N. and anti-President Preval themes)
in the downtown area of Port-au-Prince since early June.

¶3.  (SBU)  The EAC discussed the impact of these threats in
regard to their potential impact on the following
Embassy-related activities and events: (a) Transportation
security (daily Embassy shuttle runs); (b) Upcoming VIP
visits (CODELs); (c) Election observer teams traveling
throughout Haiti on Sunday, June 21; and (d) Activities for
post personnel over the course of the next week.

¶4.  (SBU)  EAC members concluded the meeting noting that all
appropriate security measures are currently in place and that
no additional security measures are warranted at this time.
Post will maintain restrictive travel policy for the downtown
area.  The general assessment of the EAC and UN interlocutors
is that the demonstrations and violence are likely to
continue and may escalate as noted by the burning of a U.N.
vehicle yesterday.  The EAC will continue to monitor the
threats and will meet as necessary.  The EAC did agree that a
Warden's notice is warranted and was issued as Warden's
Message No. 72 dated June 18, 2009.  RSO will decide on
Travel Requests on a case-by-case basis and will encourage
travelers to limit their requests to operational need only.
