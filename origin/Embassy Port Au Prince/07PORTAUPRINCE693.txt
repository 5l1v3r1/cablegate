¶2.  (SBU) On April 13, Ambassador Sanderson met with the 
Spanish Ambassador to Haiti, Paulino Gonzalez Fernandez 
Corugedo, and his colleague, Ambassador Luis Garcia Cerezo, 
here from Madrid on a special investigative mission to 
discuss the 2004 death of Spanish journalist Ricardo Ortega. 
The journalist was caught in the middle of an anti-Aristide 
demonstration in Port-au-Prince on March 7, 2004, during 
which pro-Aristide gangsters opened fire.  (Note:  U.S. 
Marines were also involved in the fire fight, and some human 
rights groups have claimed that the Marines killed Ortega. 
No concrete evidence has ever emerged to substantiate this 
charge.  End note.)  Cerezo was in Haiti to demarche the 
Haitian government to re-open the investigation and said that 
the GoH seemed more determined than during his last visit to 
follow up on the case.  He requested informally that the 
Ambassador mention the case during one of her meetings with 
Prime Minister Jacques Edouard Alexis and/or Justice Minister 
Rene Magloire.  The Ambassador agreed, assuring him that the 
Embassy would cooperate with Spanish efforts to resolve the 
case.
