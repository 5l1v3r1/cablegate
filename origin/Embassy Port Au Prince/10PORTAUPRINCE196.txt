SUBJECT: MINUSTAH'S POLITICAL ASSESSMENT: STABLE BUT WITH RISKS AHEAD 
 
¶1.       (SBU)  On February 23 Poloff met with MINUSTAH Political 
Office Director Lizbeth Cullity to review MINUSTAH's assessment of 
the post-quake political situation.  Cullity was optimistic for 
political stability in the short term, with President Preval 
receiving support from a majority of the Senate and with opposition 
in the lower chamber too indifferent or disorganized to challenge 
him.  Cullity argued that the big challenge for Preval in the 
months to come will be managing relief efforts while keeping 
displaced and unemployed residents from resorting to violence if 
their needs or expectations are not met.  A continuing challenge to 
the GOH, said Cullity, is the prospect of Preval opponents taking 
advantage of public dissatisfaction  to organize protests, weaken 
the GOH, and seek concessions (patronage and, ultimately, access to 
and control of funds). 
 
Preparations for the Donors Conference 
 
 
 
¶2.       (SBU)  Cullity noted that Preval is working to build a 
consensus on reconstruction and governance spending priorities 
among Haitian stakeholders before the international donors 
conference on March 31.  Preval advised MINUSTAH he will be meeting 
separately with stake holders (within the banking, manufacturing 
and political sectors, for example) before the 31st Also in 
preparation for the donors conference, MINUSTAH will conduct a 
series of 145 focus groups (10 persons each) throughout the country 
to measure citizens' views on reconstruction efforts and 
priorities.  Preval told MINUSTAH his key focus will remain 
economic development, job creation, holding elections,  and 
continuing to push constitutional reform.   With respect to the 
latter priority, Preval told MINUSTAH he will focus on proposals to 
eliminate the dual citizenship ban, revise the election schedule to 
a five-year cycle, and strengthen the powers of the president. 
 
 
 
Comment 
 
 
 
¶3.       (SBU) COMMENT:  We agree with MINUSTAH's assessment that 
prospects for short-term stability are good.  As aid continues to 
arrive in Haiti in the months to come, Preval's key challenge will 
be to ensure that Haitian quake victims continue to see aid as 
impartial, fair, and administered both by the international 
community and the GOH in a transparent manner.
