¶2. (SBU) Per Ref A, Polcouns delivered the demarche regarding 
the UNSC vote to the minister of foreign affairs' chief of 
staff, Anthony Dessources, on the afternoon of October 19. 
(Note:  With the Ambassador visiting Cap Haitien, both the 
DCM and Polcouns attempted to see the foreign minister before 
the chief of staff made himself available late in the day. 
End Note.)  Dessources listened attentively to the points 
taken from ref A and pledged to communicate the U.S. views to 
the Foreign Minister immediately and recommend that he brief 
the Prime Minister and President Preval by the end of the 
day.  Desroches admitted that a solution to the current 
impasse was needed, but gave no indication that the GoH was 
prepared to shift its support from Venezuela to Guatemala. 
Per ref B, Polcouns briefed task force by telephone 
immediately after the meeting.
