Day 8 
 
¶1.       (SBU)  Summary:  Port-au-Prince experienced an aftershock 
measuring 6.1 this morning, causing some concern but no reported 
damage.  Destruction and deaths in Cite Soleil from last week's 
earthquake were relatively low, owing to the simple, low, makeshift 
housing.  The turnout of police officers at the Cite Soleil police 
station is relatively high, compared to other stations.  Embassy 
staff is working to help Telco re-establish landline telephone 
service.  President Preval addressed the public via radio, 
complaining of the difficulties in coordinating aid, and stating 
that "Haiti will stand up again!"  The shipping company 
transporting aid to Port-au-Prince for the USG reported traffic 
jams on the land route connecting Port-au-Prince and the Dominican 
Republic, causing significant delays.  Incidents of looting and 
violence remain isolated.  End summary. 
 
 
 
HAITI AWAKENS TO AN AFTERSHOCK MEASURING 6.1 
 
 
 
¶1.      (SBU)  Residents of Port-au-Prince who thought the worst 
was over were alarmed by a significant jolt at approximately 6:00 
AM this morning, the largest aftershock since the January 12 quake. 
Though causing some panic and concern, there were no reports of 
major damage in Port-au-Prince.  However, the Embassy received a 
credible though unconfirmed report of the collapse of a multi-level 
school in Milot, south of Cap Haitien.  We understand that a 
Portuguese journalist in Port-au-Prince was seriously injured in 
the aftershock. 
 
WHEN POVERTY CAN BE AN ADVANTAGE 
 
 
 
¶2.      (SBU)  Polcouns visited Cite Soleil, where he observed 
relatively little damage.  The local police chief reported that 
approximately 3,000 residents of the area died in the earthquake, 
of an estimated 300,000 population - a low fatality rate compared 
to other densely populated neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince.  We 
credit the relatively low number of deaths to the lack of large 
concrete block buildings and the predominance of low makeshift 
shelters that better absorbed the shock.  Unfortunately, the only 
public school in Cite Soleil, a concrete block building, did not 
survive the quake. 
 
¶3.      (SBU)  According to PNH officials, the violence in the 
community is not more than it was before the quake.  The police 
station presently has 50 out of 67 men on duty (which is 
significantly above the 40 percent rate of staffing reported by 
other Port-au-Prince police stations).  The distribution of food 
that normally takes place in Cite Soleil was interrupted with the 
quake and police fear that if food and water do not get to the 
residents relatively quickly, they might see more aggression in 
coming days.  In addition, the police fear that many of the escaped 
prisoners may hook up with the existing criminals in the area to 
form gangs which could become dangerous.  The U.S. military is 
planning to begin food and water distribution in the community 
shortly. 
 
EMBASSY STAFF WORKING WITH TELCO TO RE-ESTABLISH LANDLINE PHONE 
SERVICE 
 
 
 
¶4.      (SBU)  The Embassy's IPC office is helping to re-establish 
landline telephone service in Port-au-Prince and particularly to 
the Embassy.  IPC telephone technicians have been working with 
Telco and a group of military telephone technicians for the past 
three days to reconnect lines at Telco's distribution points in 
Petionville and Pacot. 
 
PREVAL ADDRESSES THE PUBLIC 
 
 
 
¶5.      (SBU)  In a statement broadcast on Port-au-Prince radio, 
President Preval complained that "Aid is arriving and we are not 
prepared to receive it.  When it arrives, they tell us 'Where are 
the trucks for transportation, where are the warehouses?'  The aid 
is accumulating in a backlog.  It is the coordination of aid, 
knowing what quantities, when and how to distribute it that is 
important."  In addition, in a French radio interview, Preval 
stated "A people and a country do not die.  In the past two years 
we have gone through two historical catastrophes - four hurricanes 
(in one year) and an earthquake (in the next year).  Yes, we will 
stand up again!" 
 
PRIVATE SECTOR REQUESTS U.S. SECURITY IN ORDER TO GET BACK TO 
BUSINESS 
 
 
 
¶6.      (SBU)  Representatives of Haiti's private sector met with 
the Ambassador Merten on January 19 to thank the U.S. for its 
relief efforts.  They stated that "Now, it is time to get back to 
business."  Their major concern is security at all levels, to 
include security of goods, at marketplaces, and for ports of entry 
(i.e., the seaports, the airport, and the road between 
Port-au-Prince and the Dominican Republic).  They also raised the 
issue of financial security - that is, preventing the collapse of 
Haiti's banking system given the large amount of expected 
bankruptcies and delinquent debts.  According to Richard Coles, 
representing a major Haitian business conglomerate, "If we can have 
security, within three months we will be operational with 80,000 
jobs back on the market."  Bernard Fils-Aime, representing wireless 
provider Comcel/Voila, raised the issue of misperceptions among the 
general Haitian population, who expect the U.S. military to take 
over the role of MINUSTAH and to provide relief and security. 
Regarding the role of Haitian leadership in recovery and 
rebuilding, Bernard Craan said, "The massive presence of the 
international community should not be devoid of Haitian 
participation.  We [Haiti] must not be taken charge of; we must 
take charge."  The Ambassador reiterated that the USG is trying to 
work with and build up the Haitian state as a partner and 
encouraged the group to focus on how to work together more 
efficiently. 
 
TRAFFIC JAMS PLAGUE AID EN ROUTE BY LAND FROM THE DR 
 
 
 
¶7.      (SBU)  Poloff received a call from the manager of the 
shipping company that is transporting aid supplies for the U.S. 
military via land from the Dominican Republic.  The manager stated 
that 40-foot containers presently en route to Port-au-Prince are 
being delayed by traffic jams in three chokepoints:  At Malpasse 
(on the Haiti-DR border); at Croix des Bouquets (approximately 
seven miles east of Port-au-Prince); and at the intersection of the 
highway from the DR and Rue 15th October (about one mile west of 
the U.S. Embassy).  According to the manager, the shipper's truck 
drivers are reporting 5-hour delays at each chokepoint. 
 
¶8.      INCIDENTS OF LOOTING AND VIOLENCE REMAIN ISOLATED 
 
¶9.      (SBU)  According to the Embassy RSO, reports of looting and 
violence remain isolated, and are occurring mainly in the downtown 
area.  Incidents are caused primarily by roving armed gangs.  In 
residential areas, occasional gunshots are being heard, primarily 
by armed property owners scaring off potential looters.
