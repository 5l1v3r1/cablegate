SUBJECT: PRESIDENT PREVAL CANCELS FOREIGN TRAVEL 
 
REF: A. PAP 1608 
     ¶B. STATE 145242 
 
¶1. This message is sensitive but unclassified -- protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Presidential advisor Gabriel Verret confirmed to 
Polcouns on September 7 that President Preval would not 
travel to either the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Conference in 
Havana beginning September 11 or the UN General Assembly 
Session (including an advance stopover in Washington) 
beginning September 20, contrary to his previous intentions 
reported in ref A.  Verret repeated what other GoH officials 
had previously offered as the reason for the cancellation; 
the president felt it inappropriate to travel abroad while 
violent criminal gangs continued to pose a threat to security 
in Port-au-Prince. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Per ref B, Pol delivered points on the NAM 
conference to Louie on September 6.  Louie reported that he 
understood that Foreign Minister Jean Renald Clerisme would 
lead the Haitian delegation to both events, but could not 
confirm the minister's travel plans.  Post is seeking 
confirmation of Clersime's date of arrival in New York. 
Louie offered no substantive response to the points outlined 
in ref B, but assured Polcouns he would related our views and 
the accompanying non-paper to the minister.  (Note: Louie, 
the third highest official in the MFA hierarchy,  informed 
Polouns that he would shortly take another assignment within 
the ministry.  The GoH subsequently announced his 
replacement, along with that of most of the other ministerial 
directors general effective the following day. End Note.)
