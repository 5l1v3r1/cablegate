¶1. (SBU) A group of dissident Cuban writers, led by former 
political prisoner Jorge Oliveira and Victor Manuel 
Dominguez, founded a PEN Club in Cuba, and held its first 
activity June 26 at the COM Residence.  The event was largely 
cultural, with a Cuban trio performing Cuban and American 
music, and the writers reading their own and other Cubans' 
poems, as well as works by American poets.  They and the two 
dozen other writers and dissidents present also paid homage 
to the objective of PEN clubs worldwide, which is to 
guarantee the right of freedom of expression.  The German 
embassy will host the group's second event in mid-July. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  In a less totalitarian world, this kind of 
event might be held at a church, a university, or other 
public place.  Here, the dissident writers have few options 
beyond foreign embassies or official residences -- and USINT 
policy has been to make the COMR an open forum for exactly 
these kinds of activities.  Far more important than the venue 
is the very fact of the PEN club's launch, demonstrating yet 
again that important segments of Cuban civil society are 
vibrant, and not willing to sit back and let the regime 
dictate what passes for or doesn't pass for Cuban culture.
