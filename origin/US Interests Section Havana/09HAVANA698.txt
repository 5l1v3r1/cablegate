SUBJECT: FAA UPDATES AIR TRAFFIC PROCEDURES WITH CUBA 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Miami and Havana air traffic controllers 
signed a letter of agreement (LOA) on November 12 updating 
procedures for the coordination of flights between Cuban and 
U.S. controlled airspace.  Both sides stressed the excellent 
working relationship between the Miami Air Route Traffic 
Control Center (ARTCC) and the Havana Area Control Center 
(ACC).  The U.S. delegation agreed to review information to 
be provided by the Cuban delegation regarding flights 
operating under the rules of "due regard" that could pose a 
safety risk.  Both sides also agreed to discuss switching 
from verbal to electronic flight data sharing, on the margins 
of a regional aviation meeting in Miami in May 2010. END 
SUMMARY 
 
UPDATED PROCEDURES 
------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The new LOA updates the 2005 agreement by 
formalizing procedural changes that had already been put into 
practice informally.  The LOA also includes new sections to 
promote a "safety first culture", procedures in the event of 
a catastrophic loss of power, radar and communications, and 
clarifying procedures for flight plan deviations due to 
weather.  The LOA complements separate agreements between the 
Miami ARTCC and Havana ACC regarding air traffic to and from 
the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, and an agreement 
for handing emergency medical evacuations from Guantanamo. 
The effective date of the new LOA is February 11, 2010. 
 
¶3.  (U) Miami ARTCC and Havana ACC hand off to each other 
between 500 and 600 flights daily.  The Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) controls, through the Miami ARTCC, all 
of the airspace north of Cuba's 24N boundary.  Therefore, the 
LOA covers not only direct flights between the United States 
and Cuba, but also flights between the United States and 
Latin America and the Caribbean that fly over Cuba, flights 
between Cuba and Europe, Canada and other northbound 
locations, and some flights between third countries that will 
not touch ground in either the United States or Cuba. 
 
DUE REGARD 
---------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The primary concern raised by the Cuban air traffic 
controllers was the safety issues associated with state 
(military, coast guard, etc.) aircraft flying under the rules 
of "due regard" into international airspace controlled by 
Cuba, without making contact with the Havana ACC.  Due regard 
means that the aircraft commander of a state aircraft will 
operate that aircraft with "due regard" for the safety of all 
air and surface traffic.  Flight under the "due regard" 
option obligates the aircraft commander to be his own air 
traffic controller and to separate his aircraft from all 
other aircraft.  The U.S. delegation acknowledged this safety 
concern but confirmed that state aircraft operating under the 
rules of "due regard" in international airspace are not 
required to contact Cuban or U.S. air traffic controllers. 
The U.S. delegation agreed to review information to be 
provided by the Cuban delegation regarding flights operating 
under the rules of "due regard" that may represent a 
potential safety risk; however the FAA has no regulatory 
authority in these cases. 
 
HAVANA ACC 
---------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) During their time in Cuba, the U.S. delegation 
visited the Havana ACC on November 11 per their Cuban 
counterparts' invitation.  The Havana ACC controls all of 
Cuba's sovereign airspace and all of the international 
airspace controlled by Cuba.  The Havana ACC includes eight 
control stations, including one controlled by the Cuban armed 
forces, which monitors military and state air traffic.  The 
Havana ACC is five years old and well-equipped with modern 
communications, radar and back-up systems.

¶6.  (U) Both sides agreed to a meeting of communications 
specialists on the margins of a regional air traffic control 
meeting in Miami in May 2010 to discuss the potential for

flight plan information is passed verbally in a process that 
takes several minutes per flight.
