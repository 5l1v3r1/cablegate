SUBJECT: 22 NOVEMBER REPATRIATION OF CUBANS AT 
CABANAS 
 
¶1. USINT officer transferred 12 Cubans from the 
U.S. Coast Guard cutter Ocracoke to Cuban 
authorities on November 22 without incident. 
 
¶2. The cutter docked in the Cuban port of Cabanas 
at approximately 9:30 am local time to transfer 
the migrants.  USINT officer briefed the returnees 
and provided standard information packets on legal 
immigration methods.  Officer advised the returnees 
that USINT officers would attempt to contact them 
in the next several months to assess their well 
being, including visiting some Havana-based 
returnees in their homes.  Returnees were also 
advised that they could meet with a U.S. official 
at the Refugee Annex Fridays 10 am to discuss 
specific claims of harm, including retaliatory 
acts such as being unjustly dismissed from 
one's job, being frequently detained by police, 
or being the target of public acts of repudiation. 
 
¶3. No returnees protested the repatriation to 
USINT or USCG personnel.  The cutter departed 
without incident.  The returnees were met by 
Ministry of Foreign Relations (MINREX) and 
Ministry of Interior (MININT) officials for 
transport to a Cuban Processing Center.
