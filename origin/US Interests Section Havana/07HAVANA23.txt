SUBJECT: LADIES IN WHITE TO CINDY SHEEHAN: VISIT A CUBAN 
PRISON 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: Cuba's "Ladies in White," relatives of 
political prisoners, have written to visiting American 
anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan and urged her to stop by a 
Cuban prison during her time on the island.  Sheehan and 
other activists arrived in Havana on January 6 with plans to 
march to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo, to call for its 
closure.  In a two-page letter, the Ladies criticize the 
wretched conditions at Cuban prisons, state that they have 
suffered intense harassment from the Cuban Government, and 
call on Sheehan to learn about "another reality" in Cuba. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On January 8, the Ladies in White showed us a letter 
they wrote the previous day to Cindy Sheehan.  The letter 
starts by expressing sympathy to Sheehan over the loss of her 
son in Iraq.  It states that the Ladies "feel the pain 
profoundly, because our sons, husbands, brothers and uncles 
are held unjustly in terrible Cuban prisons, simply for 
trying to exercise their right to free expression, and to 
peacefully contribute to the well-being of the Cuban people." 
 The Ladies in White, winners of the European Parliament's 
2005 Sakharov Prize, wrote that when Sheehan and her 
colleagues are marching toward the Guantanamo base, they will 
be only a few miles from the Guantanamo Provincial Prison. 
The latter is home to "peaceful and defenseless political 
prisoners (who) suffer from inhumane conditions, without 
clean drinking water, with inadequate food, deficient medical 
care, insects, rodents" and other woes. 
 
¶3. (U) The Ladies noted that a majority of their imprisoned 
loved ones are held far from home, complicating family 
contact.  The letter says that because the Ladies continue to 
demand the immediate release of political prisoners, the GOC 
has carried out a repressive campaign against them and their 
families since March 2003.  Repressive measures have included 
"acts of repudiation," systematic visits by State Security 
officials to Ladies' homes, and the blocking of the Ladies' 
free movement. 
 
¶4. (U) The letter, respectful but assertive, ends by inviting 
Sheehan to learn about another reality of Cuban society.  "We 
exhort you to visit Cuban prisons, chosen at random, and not 
one prepared by the Cuban authorities.  And above all, visit 
the Guantanamo Provincial Prison." 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: We have nothing to add.  The Ladies' letter 
speaks for itself.
