¶1. On May 28, the Namibian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
released a press statement in connection with the reported 
nuclear tests conducted by the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea (DPRK). Begin text. 
 
¶2. At the outset it is worth mentioning that the Republic of 
Namibia is a State Party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty (NPT), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
and to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
Furthermore, Namibia has signed the African Nuclear Free Zone 
(Pelindaba Treaty). It is therefore a clear indication of 
Namibia's commitment to the international principles and 
obligations under these treaties. 
 
¶3. With regard to the reported nuclear testing by the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs would like to state that Namibia has been 
consistent in condemning not only the use or testing of 
nuclear weapons, but also the production, stockpiling, 
development and transfer of such weapons. We call on those 
countries that are not yet signatories to the above-mentioned 
treaties to do so without further delay. We also call for a 
total nuclear disarmament without any discrimination. This 
would guarantee the safety and security of our planet from 
any devastating effects from nuclear weapons. 
 
¶4. In this regard, Namibia supports the use of nuclear 
materials, science and technology for various peaceful 
purposes, especially in the context of social and economic 
development. End text. 
 
¶5. Comment: The press statement is an unusual public stand by 
the Government of Namibia, and Post will convey its 
appreciation for this gesture. This statement reemphasizes 
the message conveyed to Ambassador by Prime Minister Nahas 
Angula in reftel that Namibia is indeed committed to abiding 
by international agreements regarding nuclear materials.
