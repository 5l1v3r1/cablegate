SUBJECT: Media reaction to the November 9 Nairobi Communique between 
the DRC and Rwanda on Negative Forces 
 
Â¶1. (U)  Media reaction to the Nairobi agreement has been generally 
favorable, albeit not very substantive.  Following are reactions 
from major outlets: 
 
-- Le Palmares writes that the DRC has hung itself by signing the 
plan because the deadline to submit an elaborate disarmament plan is 
too short, while the DRC army is still rebuilding itself. 
 
-- Le Phare notes that Murigande was happy with the signing because 
the DRC committed itself to fighting the ex-FAR, a diplomatic 
failure for DRC.  The paper adds that too heavy a load has been 
placed on the DRC and that fighting may take place between the FDLR 
and Nkunda's troops. 
 
-- La Reference Plus quotes signatories such as DRC Foreign Minister 
Mbusa and UN negotiator Menkerios.  Mbusa thought the agreement 
opened the way for a permanent and peaceful solution to the crisis 
of the Great Lakes region in general and in DRC in particular. 
Menkerios deemed that Rwanda and DRC had shown their firm 
willingness to take up their own destinies. 
 
-- L'Avenir writes that Nkunda is a mere lemon that President Kagame 
is now throwing away after squeezing it, and that Nkunda has been 
reduced to the status of a bargaining counter. 
 
-- Le Potentiel assumes that both the DRC and Rwanda are now drawing 
close to the outcome of the FDLR-Nkunda episode, at least with 
regard to the latest compromise signed in Nairobi. The paper's 
analysis ends by noting that signing the communique is one thing, 
but implementing it is another story.
