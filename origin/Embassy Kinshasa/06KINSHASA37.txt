¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel demarche and talking points 
January 6 to Jacques Djoli, the new chief of staff at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Djoli said the crisis in Darfur 
required continued attention and security assistance from the 
African Union and other interested parties. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Djoli also said he recognized the AU has an 
important role to play in providing stability on the 
continent and needed any assistance that could be given. To 
that end, Djoli said the GDRC would support the idea of 
rehatting AMIS under the UN. He added that the GDRC welcomed 
the forthcoming U.S. presidency of the UNSC and looked 
forward to seeing this proposal moving forward and being 
approved. Djoli added that, given the increasing power and 
influence of the AU, the GDRC should consider paying its dues 
(both past and current) to the organization. 
 
¶3. (SBU) PolOff and Djoli also spoke about possible NATO 
assistance for AMIS. Djoli offered that NATO had greatly 
expanded its operations and role since the end of the Cold 
War, but did not explicitly endorse or reject the idea.
