SUBJECT: Spanish Foreign Minister visits Kinshasa 
 
 
¶1. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos signed a 
bilateral cooperation agreement with the DRC January 28 during a 
two-day visit to Kinshasa.  He also pledged 20 million euros in aid 
for 2008 to help improve basic social services and to strengthen 
democratic institutions. 
 
¶2. Moratinos met January 28 with President Kabila, Prime Minister 
Gizenga, and Foreign Minister Mbusa.  According to press reports, he 
expressed Spain's desire to strengthen relations between the two 
countries politically, economically and socially. 
 
¶3. Foreign Minister Mbusa expressed the GDRC's regret to Moratinos 
that an artillery shell hit the Spanish Embassy during fighting 
between forces loyal to President Kabila and to Jean-Pierre Bemba 
last March 22.  Mbusa assured him that it was an accident and not 
action against Spain.  He promised to launch an investigation and to 
punish those responsible. 
 
¶4. Note:  Press reports indicated that the aid pledge would be 20 
million euros annually and that the Congolese government would 
decide how the money was to be spent.  In fact, the Spanish 
Embassy's deputy chief of mission told us February 4 that her 
government had pledged 20 million euros for 2008 only and that the 
money would be distributed through NGOs and the UNDP.  End note.
