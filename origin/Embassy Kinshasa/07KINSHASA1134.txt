REF: STATE 129919 
 
¶1. (U) PolOff spoke September 20 with Oscar Matondo, director 
of the Fffice of International Organizations at the DRC 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding reftel request for 
contributions to the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. 
 
¶2. (U) Matondo said the GDRC certainly wished to see those 
responsible for the assassination of former Prime Minister 
Hariri brought to justice. He promised to raise the issue 
with the appropriate MFA officials but noted that the GDRC, 
already facing significant budget shortfalls of its own, 
would likely be unable to contribute.
