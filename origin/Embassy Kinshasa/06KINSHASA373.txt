¶1. (SBU) PolOff met March 3 with Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Chief of Staff Jacques Djoli to discuss a variety of 
subjects, including the upcoming elections of new members to 
the UN Security Council (reftel A) and of a new UN Secretary 
General (reftel B). Djoli said in light of Guatemala's 
contributions to the UN Mission in the Congo (MONUC) and the 
death of eight Guatemalan peacekeepers in the DRC in January, 
the GDRC would definitely vote in favor of Guatemala 
receiving a seat on the UNSC. 
 
¶2. (SBU) PolOff also delivered talking points from reftel B 
regarding the election of a new Secretary General. Djoli said 
it was his understanding that an Asian nation was next in 
line to hold the position, but the GDRC did not support any 
one candidate. Djoli said regardless of the candidates' 
nationalities, they should all be committed to reforming the 
UN bureaucracy and its financial management.
