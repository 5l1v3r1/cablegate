¶1. (U) The MNJ reports on its website that it has turned the 
four French uranium workers (refs A and B) over to the ICRC, 
along with a message addressed to the French government and 
AREVA.  It says that Nigerien Armed Forces (FAN) MI-24 
helicopters bombed the villages of Tadek (just north of 
Iferouane) and Tchintouloust (about 100 kms south of 
Iferouane, off the  Iferouane-Agadez road). The Algerian 
paper Al Watan also reports that helicopters bombed Tadek and 
Tin Telous (probably a variant of Tchintouloust).  (FYI: 
Rhissa Ag Boula, the leader of the Tuareg rebellion in the 
early 1990s and war commissar of the recently created Front 
des Forces de Redressement (ref C) has a house in 
Tchintouloust/Tin Telous.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) The French DCM confirmed the morning of June 26 that 
the hostages were in the hands of the ICRC and on their way 
to Agadez.  He expected them to arrive in Agadez later in the 
day.  He said the reports of helicopter attacks were 
plausible, but the details were sketchy.  One June 25 the 
French Ambassador said that senior FAN officers denied 
bombing MNJ position, but he said that "something had 
happened."  He said his Embassy was in telephone contact with 
the hostages.
