REF: NIAMEY 629 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. The four French uranium workers kidnapped the morning of 
June 22 (reftel) have been freed and repatriated to France. 
The MNJ turned the three French men and one woman over to the 
ICRC which transported them to Agadez by road on June 27. 
They were flown to France that night. 
 
¶2.  The ICRC also facilitated the release of a Nigerien 
citizen, Idris Wirghis.  The GON claims that Wirghis had been 
kidnapped by the MNJ, but the MNJ claims they had rescued him 
from bandits.  Wirghis has not made any public comments since 
his release to clarify the matter.
