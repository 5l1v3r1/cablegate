(SBU) On June 10, Finnish MFA First Secretary Ilkka Nordberg 
told PolOff that the Government of Finland (GoF) 
provisionally sees no problem in supporting the U.S. 
candidate Lucretia Myers.  Nordberg complimented the 
candidate and said that his colleagues in the Finnish UN 
Mission in New York spoke highly of her.  GoF custom is to 
provide written confirmation via their New York delegation a 
few days before the election.
