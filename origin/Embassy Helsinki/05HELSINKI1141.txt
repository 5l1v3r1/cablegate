REF: A) SECSTATE 195483, B) HELSINKI 1131 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request. See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (U) Follow-up to reftels, Post reports that the GoF will 
donate EUR 2.7 Million (approximately USD 3.2 Million) to 
the Pakistan earthquake relief effort. Finland has pledged 
the funds to the Finnish Red Cross, who will purchase 
approximately 6,000 winter tents (including tent stoves), 
presumably from China. The tents are expected to provide 
shelter to 40,000 people. 
 
¶3. (U) Finland's defense forces made known today that they 
will donate an additional 1,000 winter tents, including 
stoves. The Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Mission (FELM) 
will be responsible for transporting this 300-ton shipment 
to Pakistan. FELM has also donated 150,000 Euros (180,000 
USD) to support two Christian hospitals in the disaster 
region. Another semi-State run humanitarian organization, 
FinnChurchAid, will donate 300,000 Euros (360,000 USD) to 
be applied to the financing of building materials and 
healthcare services. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action request: The MFA has inquired whether US 
assistance can be made available to transport the tents. 
Post would appreciate Department guidance on whether this 
is a possibility.
