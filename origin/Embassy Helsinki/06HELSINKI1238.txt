SUBJECT: REQUEST TO EXTEND INTERNATIONAL POLICE TRAINERS AT 
THE JORDAN INTERNATIONAL POLICE TRAINING CENTER - FINNISH 
RESPONSE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 192858 
 
¶1. PolChief delivered subject demarche to Anu Laaminen, 
Office Director of the MFA's Unit for Civilian Crisis 
Management.  Laaminen confirmed that Finland will maintain 
five police trainers at the Jordan International Police 
Training Center through February 28, 2007.  The GOF has 
also informed JIPTC Director Gary Bullard of its decision. 
 
¶2. Laaminen described the Finnish experience in this 
training mission as positive.  If a follow-on police 
training mission in Jordan becomes a reality later in 2007, 
she said the GOF would be prepared to participate once 
again, likely at the level of between seven and 12 police 
trainers.
