(SBU) On January 16, PolOff delivered reftel demarche to Anna 
Savolainen, Desk Officer, Unit for the Middle East and North 
Africa at the Finnish MFA.  She replied that she expects a 
Syria Association Agreement discussion post-GAERC and 
post-Gaza solution.  She said that although the working group 
was to discuss Syria and meetings have occurred in Damascus, 
Gaza is now taking precedence.  Savolainen noted that most of 
the EU appears to be in favor of the agreement, but she 
believes it requires discussion, which could occur in late 
January at the earliest.
