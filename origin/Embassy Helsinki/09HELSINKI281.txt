 ¶1.  (C) PolOff delivered reftel points to Finnish MFA First 
Secretary Marja Rosvall in the Unit for Arms Control, 
Disarmament and Non-Proliferation on July 23.   She noted in 
particular that in her opinion, Russia approaches 
participation in the Australia Group ambivalently, desiring 
to participate but not necessarily comply with group 
requirements. 
 
¶2.  (C) Rosvall also said that the open Finnish proposal 
(dated April 2008) to close the Australia Group export 
control loophole concerning related software could resurface 
for discussion in the September meeting.  The proposal 
specifically notes that certain equipment with upgraded 
software could be exported without export license even though 
the software and/or the equipment changes the functionality. 
Finland proposes Wassenaar Arrangement type controls over 
related software in toxic gas monitoring, chemical 
manufacturing and chemical and biological equipment.  She 
commented that Wassenaar type controls would unite the two 
current export control systems.
