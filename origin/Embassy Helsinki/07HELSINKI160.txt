Classified By: POLCHIEF GREGORY THOME FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
(C) Finnish MFA Director of the Unit for Arms Control and 
Disarmament Laura Kansikas-Debraise informed PolChief March 
7 that she had vetted the substance of subject demarche 
within the GOF interagency; there is now full GOF support 
at both the political and technical levels for the adoption 
at the March TEM of the revised U.S. MTCR proposal to 
modify controls on UAVs and cruise missiles.  She noted 
political support had always been strong, but that Finnish 
technical experts in particular praised the latest 
revisions to the US proposal.
