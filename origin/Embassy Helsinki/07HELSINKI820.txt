REF: SECSTATE 149648 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered demarche on the conclusions of the 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Iran to Ms. Virpi 
Laukkanen in the Legal Department of the Finnish Ministry for 
Foreign Affairs.  Laukkanen was aware of the FATF,s 
conclusions and the imminent threat that Iran poses to the 
international financial system; Finland will notify its own 
financial institutions about the U.S. advisory to banks and 
the risks of doing business with Iran-related entities. 
Laukkanen stressed that Finland fully supports EU and UNSC 
efforts to bring Iran into compliance with its obligations, 
including improved financial transparency and efforts to stop 
money laundering, terrorist financing, and WMD proliferation. 
 The GOF will duly consider issuing its own advisory to 
domestic financial institutions and companies with business 
interests in Iran.
