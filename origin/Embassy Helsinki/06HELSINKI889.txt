Â¶1. (SBU) Econoff spoke with Tapio Puurunen, Unit for Public 
International Law at the MFA about Finland's position on the 
Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed 
Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAPP).  Puurunen expressed 
that it was an interesting initiative and that Finland was 
still considering whether or not to join the organization. 
He acknowledged our invitation to coordinate efforts in the 
future should they choose to join.  For the time being, 
Finland continues to review the issue.
