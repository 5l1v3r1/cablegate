Communications Suvi Linden and her senior team to 
discuss Finnish ICT policy and the GOF's role in 
supporting ICT innovation.  The meeting also touched on 
Finland's transition to digital television, Internet 
governance and Finland's positive view of ICANN 
(Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) 
and the upcoming OECD meeting in Seoul which both 
Ambassador Gross and Minister Linden will attend.  The 
delegation then received an in-depth briefing on 
Finland's conversion to digital television last fall 
from Tauno Aijala, a senior official from the Ministry 
of Transport and Communications.  Finland is the first 
country to completely switch to digital television and 
Aijala was eager to share "best practices" and "lessons 
learned" from Finland's conversion to digital 
television.  (Note: The U.S. will make the digital 
transition in February 2009.  End note.)

issues ICANN is facing as it expands its role.
