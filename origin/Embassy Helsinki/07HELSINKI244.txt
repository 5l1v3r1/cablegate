PolChief delivered subject demarche March 30 to Laura 
Kansikas-Debraise, Director of the Finnish MFA's Unit for 
Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.  Kansikas-Debraise 
confirmed that the GOF had received the 19 January 2007 
letter from the NSG chairman suggesting, among other 
things, the sharing of information regarding export denials 
to Iran with the IAEA, UN Security Council, and non-NSG 
governments.  She said that the GOF supports sharing such 
information in other fora and has no problems, on the 
political level, with sharing such information.  MFA 
lawyers are currently examining the request, but Kansikas- 
DeBraise predicted that the GOF would soon inform the NSG 
of its support for information sharing.
