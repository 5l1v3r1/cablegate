SUBJECT: FINLAND'S RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON VENEZUELA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 117165 
 
Classified By: Mikael Cleverley for reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
¶1. (C) Acting Pol Chief delivered the reftel talking points 
to Anne Lammila, Director for the Latin America Unit at the 
Finnish MFA. Lammila chose not to elaborate on her assessment 
of the situation in Venezuela, except to point out that the 
GoF is concerned about conditions there (particularly with 
regard to democracy and human rights) and is monitoring the 
situation closely through its Embassy in Caracas. She pointed 
out that Finland's policy positions were still being 
formulated in coordination (and harmony) with the EU. 
 
¶2. (C) Lammila noted that no high-level Venezuelan officials 
are scheduled to visit Finland at this time. She expressed 
appreciation for the information and referred favorably to 
her visit to Washington last year when she met with her State 
Department counterpart and other WHA officers. 
 
¶3. (U) Note: Finland's economic ties to Venezuela are 
relatively minor. Finland imports small amounts of iron and 
steel and exports paper products and heavy machinery. The 
value of trade in 2003 was below 25M Euros. Several Finnish 
companies have subsidiaries in Venezuela, but the overall 
investment position is rather unsubstantial. Some cooperation 
has also existed in the refining of heavy crude oil for the 
production of asphalts and lubricants. End note.
