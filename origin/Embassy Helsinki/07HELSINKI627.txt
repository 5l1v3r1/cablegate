Classified By: POLCHIEF GREGORY THOME FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C) On Aug. 13, Ambassador Ware raised reftel points 
regarding next steps on Kosovo with Foreign Minister Ilkka 
Kanerva.  Kanerva said that he himself is in frequent 
contact with President Ahtisaari and that, on the EU level, 
there is agreement that Ahtisaari's plan "is still the 
roadmap" to be followed.  The GOF supports the efforts of 
the Contact Group as the process enters a new period of 
intensive negotiation.  However, Kanerva noted, this "new 
phase cannot be open-ended; it must stick to a timetable." 
The Finns are not optimistic about the eventual outcome; 
Kanerva reported that, during a recent conversation, 
Russian FM Lavrov told him "there will be no independence" 
for Kosovo under the terms outlined by Ahtisaari. 
 
¶2. (C) While the GOF generally shares the US view that 
Russia is likely to remain uncooperative following the new 
period of negotiation, Kanerva would not, at this point, 
commit his government to any "next steps" beyond a return 
to the UNSC.
