¶1. (C) PolOffs delivered subject demarche to Antti 
Vanska, Counsellor, Unit for Russia and Paivi 
Pihlajamaki, Second Secretary Unit for Europe and 
Central Asia April 28.  The GoF generally agreed 
with the points.  Pihlajamaki noted that Foreign 
Minister Stubb used the opportunity of his April 25 
meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov last 
week to raise concerns about the Presidential 
Instructions on Abkhazia and South Ossetia as well 
as the UAV shootdown (see also septel). 
 
¶2. (C) Speaking as for his own government and for 
the Finnish OSCE Chairmanship-in-Office (CiO), 
Stubb urged Lavorv to communicate more openly with 
Tblisi and to find ways of playing a constructive 
role in Abkhazia and South Ossetia without 
threatening Georgian sovereignty.  Stubb noted that 
the OSCE would be a proper forum for a broad airing 
of the UAV shootdown, and reassured Lavrov that the 
Finnish CiO would endeavor to "channel" that 
discussion in order to ensure that it remained 
productive.  Lavrov offered no substantive response 
regarding either the Presidential Instructions or 
the UAV.  He suggested that the OSCE needed to find 
"more serious" mechanisms for addressing security 
issues, but also did not say "no" to dealing with 
the issue at the OSCE, Pihlamaki reported.  Lavrov 
confirmed that President Putin had finally taken a 
call from President Saakashvili.  (GoF Comment: 
Vanska and Pihlajamaki editorialized that, while 
the OSCE discussions on Russia and Georgia are 
necessary, they are unlikely to produce major 
progress.)  Lavrov also noted to Stubb that he had 
discussed Georgia with Secretary Rice. 
 
¶3. (C) Separately, the Finns said that Lithuania 
wants the UAV shootdown and the Presidential 
Instructions added to the EU's GAERC agenda this 
week -- a move the GoF supports.
