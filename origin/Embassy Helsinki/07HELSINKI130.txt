SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE - IAEA REPORT ON IRANIAN 
COMPLIANCE WITH UNSCR 1737 
 
REF: SECSTATE 23001 
 
(SBU) PolChief delivered subject demarche Feb. 27 to Laura 
Kansikas-Debraise, Office Director of the Unit for Arms 
Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation.  Kansikas- 
Debraise thanked us for sharing the US position and said 
that the GOF is fully in agreement that Iran's continued 
noncompliance with UNSCR 1737 requires a strong response if 
diplomacy is to succeed.  For Finland, she added, Iran has 
only one option:  to halt its program of uranium enrichment 
and to comply with 1737's other provisions.  And the 
international community -- led by the P5 1 -- must find a 
way to convince Iran that diplomacy is the only way 
forward, she added.
