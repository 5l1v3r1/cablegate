REF: SECSTATE 21535 
 
(U) PolChief delivered subject demarche Feb. 27 to Laura 
Kansikas-Debraise, Office Director of the Unit for Arms 
Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation.  Kansikas- 
Debraise noted that a decision to participate in the 
activities of the Global Initiative is currently under 
active consideration within the GOF interagency process. 
The GOF had considered endorsing the Global Initiative 
Statement of Principles before the Morocco meeting in 
October, but postponed a national level because of resource 
constraints associated with Finland's EU Presidency (July- 
December 2006).  Now, the MFA is favorably disposed in 
principal to Finnish participation, but is awaiting final 
government approval.  She promised to inform the Embassy as 
soon as a decision has been reached.
