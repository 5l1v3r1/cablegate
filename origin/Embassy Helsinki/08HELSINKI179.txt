SUBJECT: EMBASSY HELSINKI REQUESTS EMBASSY SCIENCE FELLOW 
ON BIOFUEL DEVELOPMENT 
 
REF: A. 07 HELSINKI 0797 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 28712 
 
¶1. (U) Embassy Helsinki requests the opportunity to host an 
Embassy Science Fellow from the U.S. Forest Service, within 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), to research 
emerging wood-based biofuel technology in Finland.  The 
Embassy Science Fellow will collaborate with leading Finnish 
scientists and companies on biofuel development, including 
sharing information on U.S. efforts in this area.  Finland is 
a leader in biofuel development, and this visit provides 
significant opportunities for tangible collaboration between 
Finland and the U.S.  See reftel for background on Finnish 
biofuel efforts. 
 
¶2. (U) The Embassy Science Fellow will work closely with 
contacts at Finnish research institutes (Tekes and VTT), 
various universities, and Finnish biofuel companies to 
produce a state of the art report on forest biorefinery 
activities in the U.S. and Finland.  The Embassy Science 
Fellow will identify key research topics that could provide 
the basis for future joint R&D projects between the Forest 
Products Laboratory in the U.S. and key Finnish research 
institutes.  The Embassy Science Fellow will also meet with 
key government contacts developing Finland,s biofuel and 
renewable energy strategies. 
 
¶3. (U) This request has full Embassy Country Team support. 
Post agrees to provide housing, office space, computer and 
Internet access, and reasonable local travel costs (as 
needed), and other Embassy services as necessary.  Post will 
also arrange for initial orientation to Finland and the 
Embassy community, as well as arrange the Embassy Science 
Fellow,s overall schedule, including meetings with key 
contacts. 
 
¶4. (U) In as much as the Embassy Science Fellow candidate 
reportedly does not have a security clearance, the Regional 
Security Officer (RSO) requires that USDA, or another Agency, 
provide a copy of the candidate,s NACI background check 
(reference number, date, results, etc.), as well as any 
employment documentation which validated candidate,s 
trustworthiness for employment.  This information should be 
sent to post via a cable.  Receipt of the requested 
information is mandatory to make a determination as to 
whether unescorted access on the compound and into non-CAA 
spaces will be made available to the candidate.  The 
candidate,s 24/7 access will be limited to the compound 
grounds and the CMR.  Unescorted access into CAA and non-CAA 
work spaces during after-hours is prohibited.  During work 
hours the candidate must be escorted to obtain access to the 
Controlled Access Areas (CAA) of the Embassy.  Furthermore, 
access to non-CAA office space, excluding the CMR, will be 
limited to normal working hours on business days.  For 
security reasons, if candidate intends to bring a laptop to 
post, prior notification of make, model, and serial number is 
required to allow the laptop access onto the compound.   As 
an alternative, a post provided laptop can be made available 
to the candidate.  The Embassy can issue the candidate a 
laptop with access to the Internet (via our Dedicated 
Internet Network ) DIN) and a printer.  Should the candidate 
choose to bring a laptop, Internet access will still be 
limited to the Embassy,s DIN.  The candidate will be 
required to attend a comprehensive briefing with the RSO 
before an ID badge and access to the Embassy compound and the 
CMR will be granted.  Consequently, we strongly recommend the 
candidate arrive at post on a work day during normal business 
hours.  Before coming to post, the candidate should know that 
access to the Embassy is being granted due to the special 
circumstances of the Embassy Science Fellow Program; however, 
overall security of the Embassy is paramount and trumps all 
other considerations.  Hence, while reasonable accommodations 
will be made, the candidate must abide by all security 
guidelines prescribed by Department policies and regulations 
as administered by the RSO and other Embassy personnel. 
Implementation of sound security practices may cause some 
inconvenience, so the candidate is asked to be flexible and 
patient in working within the Embassy,s strict security 
policies. 
 
¶5. (U) Working closely with OES, Post has identified Dr. Alan 
Rudie from the Forest Product Laboratory in Madison, WI as an 
ideal candidate for this program.  Dr. Rudie has shown 
willingness to come as early as May 2008 for approximately 40 
days.  Finnish contacts have likewise shown enthusiasm for a 
visit by Dr. Rudie.  As this visit will be less than 60 days, 
Dr. Rudie would not require a separate medical clearance from 
MED.
