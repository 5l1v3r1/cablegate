SUBJECT: FINNISH VIEWS ON JUNE GAERC 
 
REF: STATE 91167 
 
Classified By: PolChief Gregory Thome, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (U) PolChief delivered subject demarche to European 
Correspondent Jarno Syrjala June 7.  Syrjala said the GOF 
generally supports most of our points and suggested that the 
ministers will focus on the Balkans and Iran. 
 
¶2. (C) On Iran, Syrjala reiterated the warm welcome others in 
the GOF have expressed toward the new US diplomatic approach. 
 He noted that it will be crucial for all 25 EU member states 
to support fully joint US/EU-3 efforts and that such support 
will depend on the EU-3 sharing as much information as 
possible with other members.  He said that the US appears to 
want to be as transparent as possible, which should help 
facilitate information sharing. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On the Balkans, the Montenegrin parliament's fast 
decision to declare independence took the EU by surprise, 
Syrjala said.  The GOF is not overly concerned with the 
declaration itself given that, in general, the Serbs still 
"appear to be OK" with post-referendum developments. 
However, he added, in the wake of the EU's decision to 
suspend negotiations with Belgrade -- and with Kosovo talks 
appearing to trend away from what the Serbs are hoping for -- 
some EU foreign ministers are less sanguine than the Finns 
about how the Montenegrins' decision will affect Serb 
thinking.  Syrjala also opined that the carrot of a "European 
perspective" could actually turn into a stick, given that 
Serbia appears likely to continue to fall short of its ICTY 
obligations.  The GOF "wants something positive to happen for 
Serbia," but ICTY cooperation remains a non-negotiatable 
condition that must be met.
