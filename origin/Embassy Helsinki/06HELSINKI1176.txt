SUBJECT: FINLAND TO SUPPORT U.S. POSITION ON LRIT AT IMO,S 
MSC MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 183434 
 
Classified By: Econoff Glenn Lewis for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on the 
International Maritime Organization,s (IMO) Maritime Safety 
Committee meeting (MSC) to Captain Paavo Wihuri, Director of 
Maritime Safety at the Finnish Maritime Administration. 
Captain Wihuri will also be leading the eight person Finnish 
delegation to the meeting in Turkey. 
 
¶2. (C) During an EU coordination meeting on October 10, 
Wihuri said EU member states agreed in principle with the 
U.S. proposal to have the IMO serve as the interim Long Range 
Identification and Tracking (LRIT) coordinator.  As chair of 
the EU meeting, Wihuri said the member states were impressed 
by the U.S. expertise in this area and how well AMVER had 
functioned.  Wihuri commented that he expects China to oppose 
the proposal and that Russia will likely be neutral.  Wihuri 
was not as familiar with the GMDSS proposal, as it was not 
raised during the EU coordination meeting. 
 
¶3. (C) Wihuri said his office was concerned that MSC Vice 
Chairman Neil Ferrer from the Philippines does not have the 
"capability" to function as the MSC Chair following the death 
of Igor Ponomarev.  They would likely support the previous 
Chair Tom Allen from the UK should IMO Secretary-General 
Efthimios Mitropoulos call for a new Chair. 
 
¶4. (C) Wihuri said the launching of missiles without warning 
by North Korea was a clear violation of maritime safety laws; 
however, he cautioned that the Navigation Safety 
Sub-Committee should focus on "the issues at hand" and avoid 
politicizing North Korea,s actions.  He said during a 
previous meeting that Japan, and to a lesser extent the U.S., 
had taken a strong stance that may have been 
counterproductive in causing North Korea to change its 
actions.  Wihuri stressed that the issue should be discussed 
solely on the merits of safety at sea and that the 
Sub-Committee should work to resolve the issue separately 
from politics.
