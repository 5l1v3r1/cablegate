¶1. (SBU) In response to reftels, Ulla-Maija Finskas, Director 
of the MFA Unit for Humanitarian Assistance, said that 
Finland will donate 8,000 winter tents to the Pakistan 
earthquake relief effort. The assistance, valued at 
approximately $4 Million, will be administered through the 
Finnish Red Cross. Regretting that Finland's donation could 
not be larger, she commented that "We do not have donor 
fatigue; we are simply out of money." She projected the 
FinnChurchAid, a humanitarian organization run by the (state) 
Lutheran Church, would also join the relief effort.
