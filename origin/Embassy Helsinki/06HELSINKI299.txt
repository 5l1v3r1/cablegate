Â¶1. (U) Econoff delivered the talking points in the reftel 
demarche to officials at the Ministry of Environment, 
Ministry of Social Affairs and the National Product Control 
Agency for Welfare and Health.  They noted that the 
Technical Committee on Classification and Labeling, as well 
as its sub-group, the Specialized Experts in the Fields of 
Reprotoxicity, had submitted their recommendations, and that 
the decision now rests with the Commission.  Econoff 
encouraged the Finnish authorities to consider the U.S. 
position in the event that they are still afforded the 
opportunity to contribute.  Econoff also emphasized the 
benefits of postponing classification, pending (1) guidance 
on normal handling and use criterion as well as (2) the 
completion of full risk assessment by the Austrians.
