¶1. (SBU) Econoff spoke with Reijo Aarnio, Data Protection 
Ombudsman in the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman, an 
independent authority operating in connection with the 
Finnish Ministry of Justice.  According to Aarnio, Finland's 
data protection framework is rooted in Article 10 of the 
Finnish Constitution, the Personal Data Act, and applicable 
EU directives. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Personal Data Act in Finland governs the 
processing of all personal data, including "no fly" lists. 
Finland has no plans to change its procedures for data 
protection with regards to the transmission of passenger 
data to other countries.  Aarnio believes the current system 
is working well so there is little reason to further 
restrict the passing of passenger data.
