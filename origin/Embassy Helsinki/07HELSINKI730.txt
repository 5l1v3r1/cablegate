SUBJECT: FINLAND SUPPORTS CARGO SCANNING, CONCERNED ABOUT 
FEEDER PORTS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 119837 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on the new U.S. 
law on maritime cargo scanning to Jyrki Linna, Olli Tuomisto 
and Erik Dannback, all from the Finnish National Board of 
Customs.  Already aware of the U.S. requirement to scan all 
cargo by the end of 2012, Finnish officials are generally 
supportive of measures to increase overall container 
security.  All sea containers from Finland destined for the 
U.S. depart from one of Finland's ten "feeder ports" to 
ultimately be reloaded onto larger vessels at "deep sea 
ports" outside of Finland.  Finnish officials hope all 
containers departing from Finnish ports can be fully scanned 
and sealed while still in Finland, thus speeding cargo 
time-to-market.  Acknowledging the anticipated expense for 
scanners, Finnish officials nevertheless hope all feeder 
ports can receive the necessary equipment and certification 
to scan and secure containers for the entire trip to the U.S. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Customs officials recognize this new law 
necessitates  that the Customs Department play a more 
significant role in certifying containers, something local 
port authorities have typically done in the past.  This 
change will likely require a restructuring of Board of 
Customs' duties and its jurisdiction in Finland.  While again 
supportive of U.S. measures to improve security, Customs 
officials anticipated that the EU will require similar checks 
at U.S. ports on a quid pro quo basis, and that some 
countries might appeal to the WTO if the added security 
measures are shown to have an adverse impact on worldwide 
flow of goods. 
 
¶3. (U) There has been no notable coverage in the Finnish 
press of the U.S. cargo scanning requirement.
