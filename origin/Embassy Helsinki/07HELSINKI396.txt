SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE:  FOLLOWING UP ON U.S. INVITATION 
AT THE NUCLEAR SUPPLIERS' GROUP (NSG) PLENARY FOR AN 
OPEN-ENDED SEMINAR TO DISCUSS UNSCR 1737 AND 1747 
IMPLEMENTATION 
 
REF: STATE 69283 
 
PolChief delivered subject demarche to Tarja Pesamaa, Deputy 
Director of the Finnish MFA's Unit for Arms Control, 
Disarmament and Non-Proliferation.  Finland strongly supports 
an open-ended meeting on national implementation to include 
as much information exchange as possible.  She characterized 
Russia's move in South Africa to block consensus on forming a 
working group as unhelpful, but said that Finland is 
perfectly comfortable with an information exchange that is 
informal or "open ended." The GOF will attend the Vienna 
meeting.
