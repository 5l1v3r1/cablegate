Â¶1. (S) On February 8, Political Section Chief delivered 
subject demarche to Laura Kansikas-Debrais, the Finnish MFA's 
Director for Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-proliferation. 
 Kansikas-Debrais said that no Finnish firm has applied for a 
GOF license to sell dual-use items to the Iranian procurement 
entity Samamicro, nor does the GOF have evidence of contact 
between Samamicro and any Finnish firms.  She noted that 
Finland is deeply concerned about the volatile situation in 
Iran, adding that she could not envision a scenario in which 
her office would approve any expert license to any Iranian 
entity given the current climate.
