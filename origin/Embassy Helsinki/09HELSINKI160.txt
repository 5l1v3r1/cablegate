¶1. (U) Three Finnish citizens who recently returned from travelling 
in Mexico have been tested for possible swine flu.  One test has 
come back negative; the other two test results should be known 
within a week.  The case garnering intense media attention involves 
an elderly woman who returned to Lahti (100 kms north of Helsinki) 
two weeks ago after living in Mexico for nine months. According to 
local press reports, she exhibited flu-like symptoms for one week 
before finally seeking medical assistance at a local hospital.  She 
was immediately placed in isolation, her condition is mild and 
stable, she's taking antiviral drugs, and she is in no danger. 
 
¶2. (U) The Finnish Government announced April 28 that it will 
acquire more antiviral drugs and protective clothing for medical 
personnel.  More than 880,000 doses of the antiviral Relenza are to 
be stockpiled, as well as an additional 90,000 more doses of 
Tamiflu, in addition to the more than 90,000 that have already been 
stockpiled.  Finland has also decided to acquire a vaccine against 
swine flu as soon as one becomes available even though no such 
vaccine yet exists. Finnish travelers have been urged to defer 
travel to Mexico for the time being.  Local newspapers have also 
reported that Finns - alarmed about the swine flu - are buying up 
stocks of Tamiflu and protective masks, even the ineffective 
surgical masks and hand wash.  Many pharmacies in the Helsinki 
region are running out of masks and customers are being referred to 
hardware stores for more effective masks. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Embassy Helsinki's EAC met on April 29 to discuss and 
review the Post's Emergency Action Plan, pandemic influenza 
tripwires, and Mission preparedness.  EAC determined that tripwires 
had not been triggered and that it would recommend in any case that 
Americans (including Embassy staff) seek care in Finland rather than 
depart for the United States.
