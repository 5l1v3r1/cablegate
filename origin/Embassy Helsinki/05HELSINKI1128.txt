PolChief delivered reftel demarches to Anna Gebremedhin, 
regional manager of the Finnish MFA's Department for Africa 
and the Middle East.  Gebremedhin welcomed both the 
Foundation for the Future initiative and the Fund for the 
Future, but noted that Finland would be unable to make a 
contribution either bilaterally or through the EIB at this 
time.  She did not rule out possible contributions in future 
years.
