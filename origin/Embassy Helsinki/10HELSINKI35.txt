SUBJECT: FINLAND'S VIEWS ON JAN 25 FAC TOPICS 
 
REF: A. KONICK TO EU POSTS JAN 16 EMAIL 
     ¶B. ARNOLD TO KONICK/EU-ERA JAN 22 EMAIL 
 
Classified By: P/E Chief Scott Brandon, Reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: In a January 22 meeting with PolEconOff, 
Finnish Acting Deputy European Correspondent Juha Mustonen 
received U.S. points on FAC agenda items contained in ref A 
and provided the following responses, previously reported in 
ref B email.  In general Finland supported almost all U.S. 
positions reflected in the points with exceptions as noted 
below. END SUMMARY. 
 
---- 
IRAN 
---- 
 
¶2. (C) According to Mustonen, the EU is keen to have Ashton 
play the same role Solana filled in the E 3 3.  Regarding 
nuclear-related sanctions, the focus of discussion will 
likely be on passing sanctions at the UN while taking steps 
internal to the EU to ensure rapid and effective 
implementation, rather than on EU sanctions independent of UN 
authorization.  Some governments seem inclined to link the 
human rights issue with the nuclear one, willing to turn a 
blind eye to the human rights violations if this helps 
resolve the nuclear problem.  Finland opposes this, Mustonen 
noted, while confirming that it called in the Iranian Charge 
in Helsinki last week for the fourth time since the June 
elections to complain about the deteriorating human rights 
situation. 
 
------ 
BOSNIA 
------ 
 
¶3. (C) Finland thinks that the time is right for the EUSR to 
be established separately from OHR, as the EUSR can then 
focus on reforms needed to pave the way for membership, 
revealed Mustonen.  Finland believes Bosnian leaders should 
be given a strong message that they are in danger of becoming 
the laggards of the neighborhood in regard to progress 
towards EU and NATO membership.  Finland would like to see 
the EU condemn the actions of the RS leadership which 
contravene Dayton and thinks it may be possible to apply 
pressure through Serbia as well.  The status quo is not an 
option in Finnish eyes, according to Mustonen, while 
predicting that the FAC will allow EUFOR to perform both 
executive and non-executive mandated missions. 
 
------- 
SOMALIA 
------- 
 
¶4. (C) The EU is increasingly looking at the Horn of Africa 
and Yemen as one ecosystem, and Yemen will likely be 
discussed concurrently with Somalia.  Regional players are 
key, especially those of the GCC.  FM Stubb discussed Somalia 
on his recent trip to the Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman. 
Finland sees the Spanish idea for a conference on Somalia 
with TFG participation as positive, since the TFG,s mandate 
is up next year and they needed to be pushed to increase 
contact with the moderate opposition which remains outside of 
the Djibouti process.  EU Somalia envoy Pekka Haavisto will 
travel to Addis Ababa and possible elsewhere in the region at 
the end of January.  Finland sees a possibility to contribute 
a small number of trainers to the EU training mission for 
Somali forces in Uganda which the FAC will approve.  Mustonen 
repeated that the GOF has a political mandate to take part in 
ATALANTA but no resources are yet available.  The EU is 
looking at the possibility of prosecuting pirates in South 
Africa, Mauritius, and Uganda, though the latter is 
problematic due to its use of the death penalty. 
 
----- 
YEMEN 
----- 
 
¶5. (C) There will be conclusions on Yemen, affirmed Mustonen. 
 It is currently on its way to becoming a failed state, and 
Finland welcomed the focus on the issue at the FAC and the 
London conference to follow.  The EU wants to encourage 
reforms by the ROYG in the areas of rule of law, border 
control, human- and arms-trafficking, and anti-piracy 
measures.  Involvement of the GCC countries is key as is 
increased EU-U.S. cooperation, the latter of which should be 
strengthened by the London conference.  It may be helpful for 
the U.S. and the EU to coordinate on messages to the UN and 
World Bank about their development programs in Yemen.  The 
GCC might be a good partner in projects focused on 
antiterrorism and anti-piracy, opined Mustonen. 
 
-------------------- 
AFGHANISTAN/PAKISTAN 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) According to Mustonen, the EU needs to have a Pakistan 
discussion in the FAC before the summit with Pakistan in the 
spring, and the ground hasn,t yet been prepared for this. 
The GOF didn,t have talking points regarding Afghan 
parliamentary elections to share with us, as they didn't seem 
to have expected it to be discussed.  The likely themes the 
EU will adopt for London Conference include Afghan ownership, 
civilian coordination, and stronger EU leadership and 
internal coordination.  The EU will build on the conclusions 
adopted in December GAERC regarding developing local/regional 
government and strengthening reintegration.  Finland will 
likely to focus more attention on agricultural development 
with a view to providing livelihoods to demobilized fighters. 
 Finland seeks a stronger role and more support for UNAMA and 
improved NATO-UN-EU coordination at all levels. 
 
----- 
HAITI 
----- 
 
¶7. (C) The FAC will follow-up conclusions of the 18 Jan 
exceptional FAC.  We can expect increased EU humanitarian aid 
to be sent via the UN.  Finland would like to see Haiti used 
as a test-case for the Transatlantic Sustainable Development 
Dialogue (a Finnish initiative).  Security is not yet 
critical, and Finland would rather not see the EU take a 
direct role in that area, but the EU will support the UN 
effort and U.S. presence.
