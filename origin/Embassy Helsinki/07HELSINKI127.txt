SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE - FURTHER EXTENSION OF 
INTERNATIONAL POLICE TRAINERS (IPTS) AT THE JORDAN 
INTERNATIONAL POLICE TRAINING CENTER (JIPTC) 
 
REF: SECSTATE 15955 
 
Marita Maunola of the Finnish MFA's Unit for Civilian 
Crisis Management contacted PolChief Feb. 26 in response to 
subject demarche.  Maunola informed that Finland will 
maintain two police trainers for the JIPTC through the end 
of April 2007.  She added that if the Department finds 
subsequent funding through the end of September 2007 or 
beyond, Finland would likely contribute five trainers.
