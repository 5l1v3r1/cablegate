HAS NOT YET RECEIVED DPM SALIH LETTER 
 
REF: A. STATE 240444 
     ¶B. STATE 209778 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Earle I. Mack, for reasons 1.4(B) and (D) 
 
¶1. (C) Embassy delivered Ref A demarche November 10 to Anu 
Laamanen-Ryter, Director of the Finnish MFA's Unit for 
Civilian Crisis Management.  Laamanen-Ryter said that Finland 
would like to find a way to assist the Iraqi Special Tribunal 
(IST) if it can.  The GoF would hope to find some area in 
which they could aid the Tribunal without evoking a domestic 
political debate in Finland over capital punishment in Iraq. 
 
¶2. (U) Laamanen-Ryter said that to the best of her knowledge, 
the GoF has yet to receive the expected request letter from 
Deputy PM Salih.  Her unit has since checked with the rest of 
the MFA and with the office of Finnish Prime Minister 
Vanhanen, and can find no indication that the letter has been 
received. 
 
¶3. (U) For S/WCI: If Department and IIG wish, Embassy 
Helsinki would be happy to convey a copy of Deputy PM Salih's 
letter to the GoF.  Letter can be e-mailed to Political 
Section Chief Hall at HallJM@state.gov, or faxed to us at 
358-9-6162-5766.
