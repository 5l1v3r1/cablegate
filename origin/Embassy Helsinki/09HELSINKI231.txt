EUROPEAN SECURITY ARCHITECTURE PROPOSALS

¶1. (C) SUMMARY.  The Finns agree with the U.S. on how to 
address Russia's proposed overhaul of European Security 
arrangements, in particular on the core principles of 
focusing on existing institutions, examining security 
comprehensively and working through the OSCE.  The challenge 
for the Finns is to get the EU to act more proactively and 
with a common voice.  They have seen Russia make several 
grand proposals - on security, energy and EU-Russia 
institutions - and have not been satisfied with the EU's 
response; as a result, the Finns would like to see the EU and 
U.S. take the initiative, in part by driving the agenda at 
the informal OSCE ministerial in Corfu in June.  To that end 
the Finns have proposed agenda items for the ministerial: 
establishing a "high level reflection group" to make 
proposals on resolving frozen conflicts; "reinvigorating the 
work on military security"; and "launching a debate on new 
ways to bolster comprehensive security."  As Foreign Minister 
Stubb chaired the last debate on a proposed new European 
security architecture (in Finland's December 2008 OSCE 
ministerial), Stubb likely will open the debte at Corfu. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
FINNISH AND US VIEW THE SAME 
 
¶2. (C) In a June 12 meeting with Pol/con chief, Mikko 
Hautala, senior advisor to Foregn Minister Stubb, said the 
Finnish and US approaches to the Russian-proposed overhaul of 
European security arrangements are basically the same (REF). 
 He pointed to agreement on three basic principles for any 
discussion of the proposals: it would be based on existing 
institutions, would examine security "comprehensively" and 
would take place through the OSCE.  The challenge the Finns 
see is not on the transatlantic side, but within the EU. 
They see inactivity and a lack of coherence, and would like 
to see the EU address both problems in advance of the 
informal ministerial in Corfu.  They want to see the EU "as 
active and united as possible." 
 
US/EU SHOULD TAKE INITIATIVE FROM RUSSIA 
 
¶3. (C) According to Hautala, the Finns have seen the Russians 
raise a series of proposals - on security, on energy and on 
EU-Russian institutions - and have not seen the EU respond 
effectively.  They feel the EU needs to be more proactive and 
organize itself before the next Russian proposal arrives. 
Regarding a new security architecture for Europe, Hautala 
said the EU (and the U.S.) must identify topics "that would 
be useful to us and maybe difficult for them (the Russians)." 
 Foreign Minister Stubb raised this point in a June 1 letter 
to the Greek and Czech Foreign Ministers, which stated that 
in Corfu the EU should "voice profound concern over the lack 
of implementation of some key OSCE commitments" and that 
rebuilding trust between participating states required a 
willingness to fulfill those commitments.  (NOTE: Letter sent 
to Nordic-Baltic desk.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶4. (C) According to the June 1 letter, the EU and U.S. should 
take the initiative and establish a concrete agenda.  The 
Finns propose three topics: resolution of protracted 
conflicts; safeguarding and enhancing existing military 
security, arms control, and nonproliferation commitments; and 
"re-energizing" comprehensive security.  On the first, the 
Finns propose a "high level reflection group" that would 
"provide recommendations for enhanced approaches" for 
resolving those frozen conflicts.  Hautala said the conflicts 
should be addressed comprehensively, not just separately. 
The high level group would not serve as a diversion or to 
hide the issue but would keep it on the agenda and "avoid the 
usual fight in separate political groupings."  The group 
would present its recommendations at the December OSCE 
ministerial in Athens.  Hautala said the Finns realized their 
proposals may not succeed, but they would like to see the 
US/EU drive the agenda in some way. 
 
UNCERTAINTY AND SEPARATE VOICES WITHIN THE EU 
 
¶5. (C) Seeking a united EU is a highly ambitious goal, 
Hautala allowed.  The Finns recognize the significant 
differences between EU members regarding Russia,s proposals. 
 For example, the Finns have engaged the Baltic countries 
closely, because while the Finns embrace the need for debate 
on the proposals the Baltics are extremely leery of any 
debate.  Stubb's message to the Baltics has been "our goals 
are the same, but our tactics differ." In addition, when the 
European Council meets on June 18 it will have received 
 
HELSINKI 00000231  002 OF 002 
 
 
papers on the way forward from the Germans, French and the 
Secretariat.  Hautala expected there would be little time for 
"major debate."  Stubb might propose a set of compromise 
proposals to facilitate a consensus. 
 
FINNISH ROLE AT CORFU 
 
¶6. (C)  Hautala said that Stubb would have a role at the 
beginning of the discussion at the ministerial.  As Stubb 
chaired the last debate on the subject - at the last 
ministerial in Helsinki - it seemed natural for Stubb to 
frame the debate in Corfu.  Stubb may hold a phone 
conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov before the 
ministerial, and Stubb hopes to consult with the US before 
Corfu.
