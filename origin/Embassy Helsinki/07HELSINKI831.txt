¶1. (U) Summary: Embassy Helsinki is actively promoting 
activities to revitalize the GLOBE (Global Learning and 
Observations to Benefit the Environment) program in Finnish 
schools.  Utilizing part of a $10,000 (FY2007) grant in 
Public Diplomacy funding from the State Department, Embassy 
Helsinki organized a very successful Teachers' Conference on 
September 21st and subsequently worked with GLOBE 
Headquarters to create an email listserv for educators to 
communicate and share best practices.  These activities are 
designed to encourage educators to promote constructive 
discussions about climate change, energy use and 
conservation, as well as science education and discovery. 
GLOBE is a U.S.-sponsored international program that brings 
education to life through hands-on scientific discovery about 
the Earth and its systems.  End summary. 
 
Teachers' Conference to Revitalize GLOBE 
======================================== 
 
¶2.  (U) To begin revitalizing the GLOBE program in Finland, 
Embassy Helsinki worked with the Finnish Board of Education 
and Vaisala (Finnish manufacturer of high-end weather 
instruments) to organize a GLOBE Teachers' Conference in 
Helsinki on September 21st.  The one-day conference included 
opportunities for educators to network and share best 
practices.  The Conference featured addresses by Ambassador 
Marilyn Ware, Jari Koivisto from the Finnish Board of 
Education and NOAA's Dr. David Schultz, visiting professor at 
the University of Helsinki and the Finnish Meteorological 
Institute.  Using a variety of examples and historical 
models, Dr. Schultz addressed "How Weather Observations Are 
Used To Make Forecasts."  Educators also shared a series of 
"classroom best practices," and they established a governing 
body of educators to oversee the GLOBE Program in Finland. 
 
¶3. (U)  At the conclusion of the Conference, Econoff unveiled 
an exciting set of classroom materials that teach about 
sustainable development and global climate change in a 
non-political science-based way, including practice exercises 
that introduce the importance of personal accountability. 
The five sustainable development areas the materials cover 
are energy, waste, transportation, biodiversity, and water. 
Originally developed by GLOBE UK, Embassy Helsinki 
coordinated the translation of the materials into Finnish 
using Public Diplomacy funding.  These materials, available 
on CD ROM, are now being distributed to educators throughout 
Finland. 
 
Listserv Keeps Teachers Linked 
============================== 
 
¶4. (U) Building upon the momentum from the Teachers' 
Conference, Embassy Helsinki worked with GLOBE Headquarters 
in Boulder, Colorado to create an email listserv for GLOBE 
Teachers to communicate and share best practices.  The 
listserv also provides Embassy Helsinki an easy way to 
quickly share information with over 100 science teachers 
throughout Finland.  Recognizing Embassy Helsinki's 
significant efforts, GLOBE Headquarters is drafting a 
"GLOBE Star" to highlight the Embassy's best practices, 
especially efforts to sustain GLOBE by building a strong 
network of education, government, and business community 
supporters in Finland.  These activities also 
dovetail nicely with Post's current focus on climate change 
issues (Helsinki 00131). 
 
¶5. (U) Embassy Helsinki appreciates the strong support from 
the Department and GLOBE Headquarters in Boulder, Colorado.
