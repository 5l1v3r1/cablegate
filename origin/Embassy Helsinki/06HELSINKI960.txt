¶1. (SBU) Econoff discussed the candidacy of Mr. Steven 
Lett as Director of the International Mobile Satellite 
Organization (IMSO) with Mr. Riku Ahola, Legal Advisor 
for the Finnish Ministry of Transport and 
Communications and the appointed Finnish voting 
representative at the IMSO meeting in London.  Ahola 
was quite complimentary of Lett, who he had met on 
previous occasions.  Ahola said that Lett was well 
qualified and, if elected, he would be a strong leader 
who "understands important points" and is able to 
"express himself clearly." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Nonetheless, Ahola, who has full authority 
regarding Finnish voting in London, has yet to decide 
on which candidate to support.  He intends to consult 
with other Nordic representatives and his EU peers 
before deciding.  He was aware of the respective 
candidates from Spain and the U.K., though he did not 
have a set opinion on either of them at this time. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ahola stated that Finland does not play a 
large role in IMSO, so the specific leader is not as 
important to them as it may be to other countries. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: While we believe Ahola is sincere when he 
says that he views Lett as a strong candidate, Finnish 
support for Lett will likely come down to who remains after 
the early voting rounds.  End comment.
