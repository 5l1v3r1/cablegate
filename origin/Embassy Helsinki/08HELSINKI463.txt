SUBJECT: FINNISH COMMENTS ON OCTOBER 13 GAERC 
 
REF: STATE 108064 
 
1.(U) Poloff delivered GAERC demarche to Finnish MFA European 
correspondent Leena-Kaisa Mikkola October 10. 
 
2.(SBU) Zimbabwe: Mikkola said that the discussion on 
Zimbabwe will focus on EU humanitarian assistance and whether 
assistance can be delivered without hindrance. She further 
stated that the sanctions policy would not be changed without 
improvement. Mikkola noted that government of Finland (GoF) 
agreed with the US positions. 
 
3.(SBU) Georgia: Mikkola noted that the EU presidency does 
not want an in-depth discussion of EU-Russia relations at 
this meeting. She expects the discussion will center on 
whether the Russians have withdrawn from the buffer zones. 
Mikkola further stated that although the EU is committed to 
support of Georgian territorial integrity, she does not 
expect a discussion on travel restrictions for South Ossetian 
and Abkhaz officials. She remarked that the October 15 Geneva 
conference and the October 22 Brussels donor conference will 
be discussed. She expects that the European Council meeting 
next week may take up EU-Russia relations discussions in 
advance of the EU-Russia November summit. Mikkola remarked 
that the EU mission has started to function quite well and 
that the EU may congratulate itself on its success. 
 
4.(SBU) Belarus: Mikkola stated that the GoF is not far from 
the US position on Belarus. She noted that the EU has had 
sanctions in place for four years and would not lift them 
completely but will discuss them in light of the positive 
news on the release of political prisoners and possibly 
suspend some sanctions. Mikkola remarked that the 
parliamentary elections were not as democratic as hoped. 
Foreign Minister Stubb met with President Lukashenko in 
Belarus a couple of days ago and will likely brief the EU. 
The GoF views Belarus as far from perfect but regards 
engaging with it especially important following the crisis in 
Georgia. Mikkola said that Belarus has been under pressure 
from Russia to recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia but has 
not done so. 
 
5.(SBU) Uzbekistan: Mikkola said that Uzbekistan,s recent 
positive steps--including the release of political prisoners, 
legislation abolishing the death penalty, and ratification of 
international conventions related to child labor--would be 
discussed. She said that the arms embargo will stay in place 
but that certain other sanctions may be lifted.
