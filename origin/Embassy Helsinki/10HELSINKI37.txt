SUBJECT: HAITI ENGAGEMENT - REPORT FROM HELSINKI 
 
REF: STATE 5277 
 
¶1. PAS has engaged with Finnish government and media on 
Haiti relief operations and is pleased to report that 
their treatment of the earthquake and its aftermath has 
been fair, balanced and forward-leaning in terms of 
their own support and understanding.  We have seen no 
need to flag highly-biased reporting or instances of 
misinformation with media directors.  In the case of 
criticism of the efficacy of the U.S. response in Haiti 
from Finn Church Aid (FCA) -- specifically, the FCA 
Director and another rep attacking the U.S. military's 
role and an airdrop of humanitarian assistance in the 
media -- we expressed our concern directly to him.  He 
acknowledged that perhaps he'd been too critical, given 
that he offered to have the U.S. response mentioned 
specifically, publicly and positively at a concert at 
the National Cathedral last Sunday.  He said that he'd 
received some pointed criticism from Finns after his 
interview was published, who complained about the 
harshness of his comments and the positive effect of 
U.S. relief efforts. 
 
¶2. All major Finnish radio, TV, and print media outlets 
have reporters filing directly from Port au Prince and 
day-by-day coverage of events from Haiti has been wide- 
ranging and accurate.  Commentators have focused on the 
challenging difficulties ahead in terms of logistics to 
provide aid and dealing with an already impoverished 
country.  Somber assessments and even pessimism 
regarding the sustainability of international relief 
have appeared, but nothing to suggest inaccurate views 
of U.S. operations.  Some criticisms of U.S. military 
presence in Haiti were picked up from international 
wires, as were reports of organizational snafus and 
failures of supplies reaching the majority of 
earthquake victims in a timely fashion.  These were 
broadly balanced with coverage of massive amounts of 
aid pouring in and heroic survival stories. 
 
¶3. Post's outreach initiatives have included postings 
of usa.gov materials on our website; dissemination of 
Haiti info links to key contacts in media and GoF; 
responses to queries about the Bush-Clinton Fund; an 
ambassadorial blog and web entry noting Finns' and 
Americans outpouring of support for Haitians; 
preparation of bullets on USG Haiti relief efforts for 
Emboffs' speech files and addresses to schools, a 
political party and other youth groups, and other 
public fora; and plans for a U.S. speaker on emergency 
preparedness with a focus on Haiti. 
 
¶4. Post will continue to monitor all local media 
sources and flag any distortions.  Finns themselves are 
extremely attentive to misinformation and 
sensationalistic reporting; they have a tradition of 
low-key, reflective media analysis which, in this case, 
works to our advantage.
