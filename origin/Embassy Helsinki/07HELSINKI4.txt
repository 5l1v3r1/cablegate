SUBJECT: Finns Claim Progress during the UN Climate Change 
Conference in Nairobi 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Agreement on the governance structure and operation of the 
Kyoto ProtocolQs Adaptation Fund was one of the most significant 
achievements of the recent UN Climate Change Conference in Nairobi, 
according to Outi Berghall, Director of the International Climate 
Change Project at the Finnish Ministry of Environment and Vice Chair 
of the Ad Hoc Working Group (AWG) on Further Commitments.  The fund, 
which has a special focus on Africa and may ultimately reach 300 
million euros, will allow developing countries to finance clean 
energy projects.  Berghall also welcomed agreement on a five-year 
work program to enable countries to use models and scientific 
studies to better track the impact of climate change. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Commenting on RussiaQs proposal to allow developing 
countries to make voluntary Kyoto commitments, Berghall noted that 
while it is a valid concept, the language  is Qpoorly craftedQ since 
it discourages developing countries from making commitments on 
emissions.  Finland looks forward to exploring the Russian concept 
further through direct consultations with developing countries. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Berghall was pleased to see agreement by the 166 Kyoto 
countries on a comprehensive plan that will set the stage for 
further commitments by developed Kyoto countries beyond 2012. 
Leading as EU President, Finland was also able to secure support for 
an overdue second review of the Kyoto Protocol by 2008.  Berghall 
said the stalemate was broken by assuring developing countries they 
would not be required to make new commitments; the review would 
simply be an analytical assessment of past performance. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Finland continues to view Kyoto as the primary instrument 
for tackling climate change and FinlandQs post-Kyoto commitments 
will likely be a key priority for the next government. (Note: 
Finland will hold parliamentary elections in March 2007.)  Though 
FinlandQs emissions have increased in recent years, Finland 
continues to keep its Kyoto commitments by engaging in Kyoto 
projects that reduce emissions elsewhere and by purchasing emissions 
credits.
