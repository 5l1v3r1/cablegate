meeting of the pro-conservation countries of the 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) to Esko Jaakkola, 
Environment Counsellor at the Finnish Ministry of the 
Environment.  Jaakkola, who represented the Government of 
Finland at the meeting in Washington, welcomed the 
opportunity to participate and stressed that similar 
coordination meetings should happen more frequently in the 
future. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In an effort to strengthen the position of the 
pro-conservation countries, Jaakkola said then Finnish 
Minister of the Environment Jan-Erik Enestam sent a letter 
late last year to 8 EU countries (Greece, Malta, Romania, 
Bulgaria, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia) asking them to 
join the IWC prior to its annual meeting this May in 
Anchorage, Alaska.  While many of these EU countries may 
ultimately join the IWC, only Lithuania has communicated to 
the Finnish government that it plans to join prior to the 
annual meeting. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Regarding Japan,s Conference for the Normalization 
of the IWC, Finland is not/not planning to attend.  According 
to Jaakkola, Switzerland is the only pro-conservation country 
that may still attend.

(Jaakkola and one other) to the annual IWC meeting, along 
with one participant from a Finnish NGO (Finns for Whales).
