SUBJECT: FINLAND ON THE MAY GAERC

     ¶B. 2009 J. GIAUQUE EMAIL 
 
Classified By: Political Chief Scott Brandon for reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY.  The Finns doubt stronger language on Iran 
will issue from the May GAERC, given the lack of consensus 
regarding tougher sanctions. Though discussion within the EU 
has been limited, early signs are positive regarding 
continuation of Operation ATALANTA off the Horn of Africa. 
Signs are mixed, however, regarding continuation of Operation 
ALTHEA in Bosnia.  The Finns no longer consider ALTHEA a 
military crisis management operation and plan to withdraw 
most troops in June; they acknowledge a lack of consensus on 
this within the EU, though their position may be gaining 
adherents.  The GAERC provides the last opportunity for 
Member States to provide guidance in advance of the EU-Russia 
Summit; the Finns would like to see more vigorous attention 
to a successor to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement 
with Russia.  Some matters may be unripe for discussion at 
the GAERC, like the Middle East (given Prime Minister 
Netanyahu's visit to Washington) and Moldova (given upcoming 
elections).  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) On May 14 Polchief met with the MFA Director for 
European Common Foreign and Security Policy Leena-Kaisa 
Mikkola to discuss the May GAERC agenda.  Mikkola said the 
agenda would be more limited than usual, given the inclusion 
of a special meeting of Foreign and Defense Ministers. The 
Middle East is not on the agenda, and will be taken up later, 
after Prime Minister Netanyahu's visit to Washington. 
Mikkola also expressed disappointment with how the Czechs 
have been handling agenda items, saying that there is often 
limited clarity about what will be discussed.  Highlights 
follow. 
 
¶3. (C) IRAN: EU Member States (MS) have not arrived at a 
consensus regarding sanctions. The Finnish Government (GOF) 
"basically" agrees with the U.S. points (REF). According to 
Mikkola, "southern" MSs are reluctant to tighten sanctions. 
Mikkola expected that supporters of stronger language would 
not meet that objective. 
 
¶4. (C) ATALANTA: Mikkola said the EU's Operation ATALANTA 
seemed to be working quite well, and the GOF is willing to 
continue cooperation.  Discussion within the EU of an 
extension has not really begun.  Mikkola does not expect much 
opposition to an extension, given MSs' interest in unhindered 
shipping.  Early signs are positive, "even from Germany," 
Mikkola added.  How the EU might address instability in 
Somalia itself is the tougher question.  Mikkola said some 
discussions on the matter had taken place within the Council, 
but she did not know whether the Foreign and Defense 
Ministers would address it at the GAERC. 
 
¶5. (C) EU-RUSSIA SUMMIT: The GAERC will provide the last 
chance to give guidance before the upcoming Summit.  Mikkola 
expects the main focus of the Summit will be the financial 
crisis, with the EU underlining that protectionism will not 
provide a solution.  The Finns would like to see a "renewed 
impetus" on a successor to the current Partnership and 
Cooperation Agreement. 
 
¶6. (C) MOLDOVA: Mikkola had not heard any discussion of an 
EU-led investigation into the April 7 violence, but knew of 
limited discussions pointing to the importance of a role for 
the Council of Europe in any investigation.  She did not 
expect in-depth discussion of Moldova, as the more 
appropriate time would be after the Presidential election 
later this month. 
 
¶7. (C) BOSNIA/ALTHEA OPERATION: Mikkola said that the GOF 
differs from the U.S. on Operation ALTHEA.  The Finns no 
longer view it as a military crisis management operation. 
They believe the mission should come to a close and the EU 
should focus on training and mentoring.  Mikkola said some 
within the EU have complained of "sudden withdrawals." The 
Finns believe their decision to withdraw all but 3-5 troops 
in June is not sudden and has long been known.  Mikkola said 
that at one time their position was in the clear minority in 
the EU.  That has changed, and she estimated it more at 50-50 
or above for their position.  Mikkola acknowledged the EU 
remains far from a consensus on this point. 
 
¶8. (C) GEORGIA: Mikkola expressed doubts about the OSCE 
continuing its mission. She said the EU must consider 
continuation of its role and mission in light of the problems 
confronting the OSCE mission, adding that discussion has not 
started.  Mikkola said that beyond these missions the EU must 
consider how to bring Georgia and the EU closer.  The GOF 
strongly favors pursuing "visa facilitation," trade 
liberalization and an Association Agreement.  Mikkola said 
the EU must do morethan simply signing papers with the 
Georgians, they must take actions that show concrete 
progress.
