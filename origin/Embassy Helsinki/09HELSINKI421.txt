REF: STATE 112644 
 
¶1. (SBU) Pol/Econoff delivered reftel remarks to Markku 
Lampinen, The MFA,s Deputy Director for the Unit for the 
European Union Common Foreign and Security Policy.  With 
obvious reluctance Lampinen said the Finnish government (GOF) 
is ready to extend the sanctions but would like to see a 
mechanism put in place to review them annually. He expressed 
skepticism as to whether the sanctions still have an 
influence on the reform process.  Lampinen said the GOF 
favors engagement as they feel that total isolation does not 
work. He said the status of the sanctions discussion within 
the EU was unclear, and EU discussions on November 10 would 
shed some light on Member States, positions.  He added that 
the discussion in Brussels mainly revolves around the 
sanctions, technical issues, such as whether a future 
lifting of the sanctions should coincide with the end of a 
waiver period. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In separate meetings with EUR NB Director 
Silberstein, MFA officials expressed similar doubts about 
sanctions and support for engagement. The MFA,s Eastern 
Affairs Deputy Director Hanna Lehtinen said she expected the 
EU to continue sanctions.  She then spoke of the need to 
encourage unspecified positive signs from the Belarus 
government.  Mikko Hautala, Advisor to Foreign Minister 
Stubb, spoke critically of sanctions on Belarus. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: It seems that the GOF will agree to a 
position continuing sanctions while withholding application, 
but it is unlikely it will offer strong support.  END 
COMMENT.
