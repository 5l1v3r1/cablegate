SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE: U.S. DRAFT RESOLUTION ON 
"CONDEMNING THE USE OF RAPE AS AN INSTRUMENT OF STATE 
POLICY." 
 
REF: SECSTATE 135255 
 
(SBU) PolOff delivered subject demarche to Kirsti 
Pohjankukka, PolOff Unit for Human Rights Policy, October 
Â¶4. Pohjankukka stated that, in principle, the GOF supports 
our draft.  However, there are some issues that we may view 
as potentially contentious which the Finns may hope to see 
reflected in the refined draft.  Because the GOF wishes, 
ultimately, to see the resolution pass, it will encourage 
EU consensus on a final draft.
