SUBJECT: LONDON CONFERENCE ON AFGHANISTAN: FINNISH GOALS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 03627 
 
¶1. (SBU) Responding to reftel demarche, MFA officials 
expressed their overall agreement with our stated goals and 
were grateful to be kept apprised of the US position. 
Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Mari Kiviniemi 
will represent Finland at the London Conference on 
Afghanistan, where she will commit Finland to a significant 
5-year pledge. Our interlocutors estimate this pledge to be 
approximately EUR 10M (USD 12M) per year. The Finns also 
intend to continue their military presence in Afghanistan -- 
including possibly taking over leadership of a provincial 
reconstruction team (PRT)in 2007 -- as well as their 
contribution toward narcotics control and good governance. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Mikko Pyhala, Head of the MFA Unit for 
South Asia, commented that he and his colleagues at the 
Foreign Ministry were "so pleased--no, thrilled--that 
Secretary Rice referred to Finland's PRT's in Afghanistan 
 
SIPDIS 
during her meeting with Ambassador Pekka Lintu." (Comment: 
His enthusiasm was a reminder of the importance Finland 
attaches to its commitment to Afghanistan, which remains one 
of the largest recipients of Finnish development assistance. 
End comment.) 
 
¶3. (U) Pyhala recommended that the third pillar of the 
Afghanistan Compact be amended to reflect economic and 
social development, "which is economically, socially and 
environmentally sustainable."
