SUBJECT: FINLAND: PRE-GAERC RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 22352 
 
¶1. (U) PolChief discussed the GAERC talking points with 
Finnish MFA EU Correspondent Leena-Kaisa Mikkola March 
¶4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) WESTERN BALKANS: Mikkola noted that several 
member states insisted on a "Western Balkans" agenda 
point, rather than simply a specific Kosovo point. 
Some agreed that it was important to emphasize that, 
following the very intensive period surrounding 
Kosovo's independence, the EU needed to return to 
focusing on the challenges facing the region as a 
whole.  Unfortunately, she added, others -- 
particularly those who are not part of the Kosovo ISG 
or "those who are not so excited about the Ahtisaari 
plan" hoped to steer the GAERC away from any 
conclusions in relation to the ISG (none are 
espected).  A discussion of practicalities and the 
challenges facing the EU Mission in Kosovo is expected. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ISRAEL-PALESTINE: The GoF welcomes Secretary 
Rice's trip to the region, and Mikkola noted that 
HighRep Solana is in the region this week.  Solana will 
brief the GAERC on his trip, but conclusions are not 
expected unless his report gives cause otherwise. 
 
¶4. (SBU) AFGHANISTAN: Mikkola suggested that 
Afghanistan was on the agenda simply because many MS 
believed it had not been a focus of GAERC discussions 
for some time.  She noted that the Slovenian Presidency 
did not seem particularly enthusiastic about including 
it but honored the request.  The GoF, for its part, is 
the second highest contributor of trainers to the EU 
police training mission, and therefore welcomes the 
discussion, she said. 
 
¶5. (SBU) GEORGIA: Mikkola noted that the discussion 
could be quite lively, given that some member states 
are aggressively pushing for the EU to rapidly enhance 
its relationship with Georgia, while others strongly 
prefer to keep the discussion "low profile."  Finland - 
- along with the Baltic MS and others -- supports more 
rapid EU movement on building the relationship, to 
include more movement on visa facilitation and other 
people-to-people exchanges, Mikkola said.
