(SBU) On May 6, Deputy Foreign Minister Armen Baiburtian 
phoned DCM to inform that Minister Oskanian had taken the 
final GOAM decision not/not to support Iran's bid for a seat 
on the new UN Human Rights Council.  Baiburtian said that 
Oskanian's decision, taken after his return from a conference 
in Vilnius, was influenced by the Secretary's letter.
