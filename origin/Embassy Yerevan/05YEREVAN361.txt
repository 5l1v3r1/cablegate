¶1.  (SBU) Ambassador Evans began his recent tour of Armenian- 
American diaspora centers on February 11, only 
three days prior to the assassination of former Lebanese 
Prime Minister Hariri, which so drastically changed the 
political landscape in Lebanon.  Conversations with Lebanese- 
origin Armenian Americans after the assassination naturally 
focused on that event, and on fears for the safety of the 
dwindling Armenian community there.  In general, there was 
very little traction for the talking points conveyed ref A. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) A prominent Armenian who had recently been in 
Lebanon and considers Walid Jumblatt to be "like my brother" 
offered the following explanation.  Syria provided a haven 
for Armenians fleeing the Turkish massacres of 1915, so 
Armenians are generally well-disposed toward Damascus. 
Syrian influence in Lebanon is so strong that "they could 
leave tomorrow and nothing would change."  The Lebanese, he 
said, are "more Syrian than the Syrians." 
The Deuxieme Bureau was cited in this connection. 
Resolution 1559 was basically a deal between the French and 
American governments; French President Chirac imagined that 
he was helping Hariri.  The Maronite Christians are "the 
problem" and Lebanese President Lahoud (whose wife and 
mother are Armenian) is not well regarded. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  An Armenian arch-bishop (Prelacy) offered 
somewhat more guarded comments that stressed the fragility 
of the Armenians' position in Lebanon and expressed fears 
for their future. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) We recognize that the situation in Lebanon is now 
radically transformed, and will therefore desist from 
holding any further discussions, e.g., with the Catholicos, 
unless Department wishes us to do so.
