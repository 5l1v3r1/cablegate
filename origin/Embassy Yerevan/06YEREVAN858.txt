CATHOLICOS GAREGIN II

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. Armenian cultural and political leaders blasted the GOT in 
the press following an incident during which a group of about 
50 protesters reportedly egged cars carrying Armenian 
religious dignitaries on their way to meet the leader of the 
Armenian Apostolic Church at the Istanbul airport.  According 
to the press, the visit of Catholicos Garegin II to Turkey 
was the third such visit by an Armenian religious leader 
since 1961.  Most news reports on the visit focused on the 
protest, while other stories covered the reactions of 
Armenian National Assembly Speaker Tigran Torosyan and other 
Armenian cultural and political figures to the news.  AZG, a 
center-right daily paper, criticized the Constantinople 
Patriarchate for publishing information on the visit only on 
its Turkish-language website, and not on its English- and 
Armenian-languages sites.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. Many Armenian news outlets carried reports of the airport 
protest, running headlines including "Istanbul incident 
during visit of Catholicos of All Armenia is barbarism," and 
"Scandal at Istanbul airport proves that process of democracy 
establishment in Turkey remains at low level."  A news story 
on the website of government-run ArmRadio concluded with this 
purely editorial comment: "Although the accident was not that 
serious, it wholly expressed the essence of the people, which 
has taken the course towards the European Union." 
 
¶3. According to reports, Torosyan questioned Turkey's 
European Union aspirations, saying that the protest 
demonstrated definitively that the Turkish people do not 
share European values and culture.  He also suggested that 
GOT Prime Minster Erdogan not address issues of freedom of 
religion when he addresses the next session of the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), 
implying that discussion of the topic would be hypocritical. 
News outlets also quoted writer Razmik Davoyan expressing 
sentiments similar to those of Torosyan.  Davoyan said 
Turkey's EU aspirations were inconsistent with "hatred" of 
Armenia.  He said incidents such as the Istanbul airport 
protest would not occur in Armenia, because Armenia's social 
values preclude such behavior. 
 
¶4. The independent online news outlet Panorama.am covered a 
meeting of the Pakagits discussion club on June 23, during 
which the club invited political and cultural leaders to 
discuss the Catholicos's visit.  According to the article, 
the discussion group participants uniformly criticized the 
airport protest, but did not agree on whether the protest had 
been sponsored by the GOT. 
 
¶5. AZG noted that Lraber, the official bulletin of the 
Constantinople Patriarchate, posted information about the 
Catholicos's visit on its Turkish-language webpage, and not 
on its English- or Armenian-language pages.  AZG noted that 
while Armenians who live in Istanbul speak Turkish, it is not 
a lingua franca among diasporan Armenians or Armenians in 
Armenia.  "By posting information on the Turkish-language 
page only, Lraber has deprived Armenians in the Diaspora and 
Armenia of the opportunity to get information on the visit of 
Garegin II so as to limit the response to the visit of the 
Catholicos," AZG reported.
