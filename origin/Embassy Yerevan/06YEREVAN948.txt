"DISPROPORTIONATE" USE OF FORCE IN LEBANON 
 
REF: STATE 114722 
 
¶1. On July 14, the Armenian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs issued a statement on the situation in 
Lebanon which condemns the use of "disproportionate 
force intended solely to collectively punish 
civilians..."  Full text of the statement below: 
 
¶2. Begin text of Armenian Foreign Ministry 
Statement: 
 
Armenia is extremely concerned about the military 
actions in Lebanon and their escalation, as well as 
the great loss of civilian life.  Armenia condemns 
any violence whether it be abduction or use of 
force.  We particularly denounce the use of such 
disproportionate force intended solely to 
collectively punish civilians and damage 
infrastructure.  This kind of reaction by Israel is 
particularly difficult to understand given the fact 
that the Lebanese government has clearly distanced 
itself from the abduction incident.  We hope that 
there will be restraint in the region and also hope 
there will be an immediate ceasefire so that the 
issues can be addressed by peaceful means. 
 
End text. 
 
¶3. Armenian print media widely covered the 
statement, describing it as the toughest ever made 
by the Foreign Ministry.  The press also cited 
Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargsian as saying 
that events in Lebanon were extremely dangerous for 
the region, but that Armenia's role in this issue 
was "close to zero."
