¶1. (U) The MFA Press Service announced May 4 that FM Oskanian 
had received a letter of condolences from Turkish FM Abdullah 
Gul.  While the information did not yet make the Armenian 
papers, wire services carried a brief notice about the 
letter, quoting FM Gul as having written, "It was with deep 
sorrow that I learnt about the tragic crash over the Black 
Sea near Sochi, which claimed many innocent lives.  I would 
like to extend my condolences to Your Excellency as well as 
to the people of Armenia." 
 
¶2. (SBU) The head of the MFA Turkey Desk confirmed receipt of 
the letter, but noted that he had not "had time to analyze 
it" at this point.  The MFA press service released the report 
about the letter quickly and, in conversations today, noted 
that they wanted to highlight FM Gul's gesture promptly.
