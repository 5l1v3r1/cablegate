ANTI-ISRAEL BIASED RESOLUTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 159386 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff met with Armenian MFA Director for 
International Organizations Dziunik Aghajanian on November 29 
to communicate reftel demarche regarding upcoming UNGA votes 
to renew Anti-Israeli biased resolutions.  Given Armenia's 
2006 votes on the three resolutions (Yes on 61/22 and 61/116, 
and abstention on 61/23), Poloff requested consideration of 
moving all votes to either a "No" or "Abstain" vote due to 
problems that these renewed mandates could cause to U.S. and 
international efforts to restart the Middle East Peace 
Process.  Poloff pointed out that recent voting trends on 
these resolutions demonstrated a lack of general consensus in 
the UNGA on these resolutions and that overall they were seen 
to be largely unhelpful in bringing a resolution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Aghajanian regretted that while it had previously 
decided to abstain on Resolution 61/23 (at U.S. behest), 
Armenia would not change from its current "Yes" on the other 
two resolutions due to two primary reasons:  1) Drawing a 
parallel between the unsettled issue of Palestine and the 
current status of Nagorno-Karabakh, the GOAM as a matter of 
principle could not vote to deny the right of 
self-determination to the Palestinian people; and 2) Given 
Armenia's participation in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 
and the resulting increase in negative sentiments toward 
ethnic Armenian minorities throughout the Arab world, the 
GOAM believed it was necessary at this time to stay firm on a 
"Yes" vote for the two remaining resolutions.
