REF: GABORONE 547 
 
¶1. The GOB Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation 
shared with the Embassy the official statement regarding the GOB's 
position on the outcome of the June 27, 2008 Presidential run-off 
election in Zimbabwe. 
 
Begin Verbatim Official GOB Text: 
 
 
¶1. The Government of the Republic of Botswana has been following the 
events leading to, and the holding of the Presidential run-off 
election on June 27, 2008 in the Republic of Zimbabwe. 
 
¶2. During this period, Botswana expressed its concern about the 
deteriorating political situation in Zimbabwe and made repeated 
calls on the authorities in that country to take necessary steps to 
ensure a climate conducive to holding free and fair elections. 
 
¶3. The atmosphere prevailing before the run-off election in Zimbabwe 
was not conducive to the holding of a free and fair election, given 
the escalating acts of violence and intimidation that resulted in 
the loss of lives, destruction of property and displacement of 
people from their homes. This eventually led to the withdrawal of 
the MDC leader, Mr. Morgan Tsvangirai, from the run-off contest. 
 
¶4. In response, the United Nations Security Council issued a 
Presidential Statement on June 23, 2008 condemning the violent 
campaign against political opposition in Zimbabwe and expressed 
regret that the campaign of violence made it impossible for a free 
and fir election to take place. 
 
¶5. In addition, the roika of the SADC Organ, which met in the 
Kingdo of Swazilandon June 25, 2008, advised that the corect 
course of action under the circumstances wa a postponement of the 
run-off election.  Thi would have provided an opportunity for all 
parties to engage in talks with the aim of finding the best possible 
way of resolving their differences. 
 
¶6. Notwithstanding the advice of the United Nations Security Council 
and Troika of the SADC Organ, the authorities of Zimbabwe decided to 
proceed with an election whose outcome was unlikely to enjoy 
credibility and legitimacy, both in the region and internationally. 
 
¶7. This has now come to pass, as the reports of the SADC Elections 
Observer Mission, Pan-African Parliament and AU Observer Missions 
have shown. 
 
¶8. These reports concluded, amongst others, that; 
> the pre-election phase was characterised by politically motivated 
violence, intimidation and displacement of the electorate; 
> the process leading up to the presidential run-off election did 
not conform to SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic 
Elections; 
> the atmosphere prevailing in the country did not give rise to the 
conduct of free, fair and credible elections; 
> the result of the June 27, 2008 run-off election did not represent 
the will of the people of Zimbabwe; and 
> conditions should be put in place for the holding of free, fair 
and credible elections as soon as possible in line with the African 
Union Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections. 
 
¶9. It is abundantly clear from these findings that the result of the 
June 27, 2008 run-off election cannot be accepted, as it violates 
the core principles of SADC, the African Union and the United 
Nations. As a country that practices democracy and the rule of law, 
Botswana does not, therefore, recognize the outcome of the 
Presidential run-off election, and would expect other SADC member 
states to do the same. 
 
¶10. It is against this background that Botswana urges SADC to assume 
its responsibilities by taking proactive steps that are consistent 
with its principles and objectives. It is therefore Botswana's 
position that Zimbabwe not be allowed to participate in SADC 
meetings until such time that they demonstrate their commitment to 
strictly adhere to the organisation's principles. 
 
¶11. Such steps would enhance the credibility of SADC and provide an 
enabling environment for the people of Zimbabwe to find a lasting 
solution to the problems that confront them. 
 
¶12. As a way forward, Botswana agrees with the AU position that 
mediation efforts should continue. We wish to urge, however, that 
such mediation efforts be expedited, given a defined time frame, and 
conducted in an atmosphere of mutual trust and good faith, where 
both parties are treated as equal partners.
