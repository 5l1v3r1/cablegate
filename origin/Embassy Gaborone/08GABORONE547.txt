Intervention by His Honour, Lt. Gen. Mompati S. Merafhe, 
Vice President of the Republic of Botswana, 
On Botswana's Position Regarding The Situation in Zimbabwe. 
 
Mr. Chairman 
 
Your Excellencies 
 
¶1.   I wish to prefix my remarks by informing this meeting 
that Botswana has over the years enjoyed cordial and fruitful 
relations with Zimbabwe and these have been characterised by 
cooperation in various sectors. 
 
¶2.   Our two countries are united by a common historical and 
cultural heritage which has brought our people together over 
centuries. 
 
¶3.   Botswana, like other Frontline States, played an 
important role to promote the cause of Zimbabwe's struggle to 
attain self-rule and independence. 
 
¶4.   We are proud to have played our role in that regard. 
 
¶5.   Our support for Zimbabwe's liberation was informed by 
our own national interests, for without a free, democratic 
and stable Zimbabwe, we could not hope to enjoy the same in 
our own country. 
 
¶6.   It is for these reasons, Mr. Chairman, Your 
Excellencies, that Botswana has made some public 
pronouncements prior to the recent presidential run-off 
elections, condemning the acts of violence and intimidation, 
and urging the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure an 
environment that is conducive to the holding of free, fair 
and credible elections. 
 
¶7.   The Election Observers, in particular those from the Pan 
African Parliament and SADC, have concluded that the election 
process did not meet the required minimum standards and did 
not reflect the unfettered will of the people of Zimbabwe. 
 
¶8.   Botswana's position, therefore, is that the outcome of 
these elections does not confer legitimacy on the Government 
of President Mugabe. 
 
¶9.   In our considered view, it therefore follows that the 
representatives of the current 'Government' in Zimbabwe 
should be excluded from attending SADC and African Union 
meetings. 
 
¶10.  Their participation in the meetings of the two 
organizations would give unqualified legitimacy to a process 
which cannot be considered legitimate. 
 
¶11.  Botswana's position is that such a scenario would be 
unacceptable. 
 
¶12.  Botswana supports the consensus that seems to be 
emerging, which calls for the two parties to be brought 
together in a mediation process to find a political solution 
to Zimbabwe's problems. 
 
¶13.  The personalities for the mediation process should be 
acceptable to both parties. 
 
¶14.  It is also Botswana's strong view that the mediation 
process must treat both parties as equals. 
 
¶15.  I wish to conclude by urging both parties to seriously 
reflect on the plight of the people of Zimbabwe. 
 
¶16.  The people of Zimbabwe have suffered long enough. 
 
¶17.  As a neighbor and a friend, Botswana stands ready to 
offer any assistance to the mediation process within the 
limits of her capabilities. 
 
¶18.  Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by saying that Zimbabweans 
are our friends and we would not be genuine friends, and in 
fact, we would not live with our conscience if we did not 
express our views honestly and objectively at this critical 
hour of need in the history of Zimbabwe and Southern African, 
and indeed our tortured continent.
