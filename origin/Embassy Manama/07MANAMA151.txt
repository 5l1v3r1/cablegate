REF: STATE 16888 
 
Â¶1. Embassy Manama wishes to nominate Mr. Mohammed Al Khawaja 
to attend PE 220: FSN Economic Training from April 30 - May 
11, 2007. 
 
A)  Name: Mohammed Al Khawaja, FSN 9/2 
 
B)  Date of Birth: September 2, 1981 
 
C)  Nationality: Saudi 
 
D)  Passport Number: 300101 
 
E)  Agency: State 
 
F)  Position Title: Economic Assistant 
 
G)  American Supervisor's Name and Email Address: Stephen 
Simpson, SimpsonSC@state.gov 
 
H1) Mr. Al Khawaja's Education: Master of Arts in Financial 
Economics, University of Dundee, United Kingdom, June 2004. 
 
H2) Mr. Al Khawaja's Job Experience: Corporate Loan Risk 
Evaluator, HSBC Middle East Bank, August 2004 - July 2005. 
Relationship Manager, Citibank, May 2004 - August 2004. 
 
H3) Mr. Al Khawaja's Current Responsibilities: Researches, 
analyzes and drafts reports on regional economic, business, 
legal, and commercial issues of interest to the USG from 
open-source materials and through personal contacts in the 
government and business communities.  Prepares factual and 
analytical reports related to Bahrain's economic trends, 
economic issues, the GOB central budget, gross domestic 
product and other developments, including economic reform and 
trade policy. 
 
I)  Description of how course will enhance Mr. Al Khawaja's 
productivity at Embassy Manama: Post's Economic Unit is a 
small office with a large mandate.  As the Embassy's sole 
Economic FSN, Mr. Al Khawaja has already proven a valuable 
resource and his contributions have been crucial to the 
success of the Political/Economic Section. However, he is new 
to his position and has received no formal job-related 
training.  His participation in the FSN Economic Training 
Course will add needed job-specific context to his formal 
economic training.  The fact-finding and drafting aspects are 
expected to be particularly beneficial.  Post assesses that 
the effectiveness and reporting capability of the Economic 
Unit will be significantly enhanced if Mr. Al Khawaja is 
granted the opportunity to receive this highly relevant 
training. 
 
J)  Suggestions for course content: The competencies and 
Foreign Service precepts addressed by these courses, as 
described in the course outlines, appear well-suited to Mr. 
Al Khawaja's needs.  As requested reftel, Post's module 
recommendations are as follows: 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Weighted PE 220 Module Recommendations 
-------------------------------------- 
 
- Drafting Skills: 15% 
- Interviewing Skills: 15% 
- What Washington Wants - 15% 
- Regional and Bilateral Trade Agreements - 15% 
- Economic Data Analysis Skills: 10% 
- Consultations With Policy Officials and End-users of Post 
reporting - 10% 
- Briefing Skills: 5% 
- Banking and Financial Market Reforms - 5% 
- Trade and Exchange Rate Regime Reforms - 5% 
- Strategic Sectors - 5% 
 
K)  The skills and topics to be addressed by PE 220 are 
highly relevant to Mr. Al Khawaja's duties.  Because the U.S. 
successfully implemented a Free Trade Agreement with Bahrain, 
any coverage of trade agreement implementation would also be 
quite useful.  Post would be interested in nominating Mr. Al 
Khawaja for PE 222: Trade Agreement Monitoring and 
Implementation which, from previous correspondence, we 
understand will be offered for the period May 15 - 18, 2007. 
 
L)  Comments on previous modules: This will be Mr. Al 
Khawaja's first opportunity to participate in FSI training.
