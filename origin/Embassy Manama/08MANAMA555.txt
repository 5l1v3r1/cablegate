TRANSACTIONS REF: A. SECSTATE 84841 B. SECSTATE 88759 Classified By: CDA Christopher Henzel for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) (C) Econoff delivered reftel points (A) and non-paper (B) to both the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance. MOF Assistant Under Secretary Yousif Humood told Econoff on August 20 that it is both encouraging and distressing to know that Iran is seeking alternative avenues to finance its proliferation activities. He said it is encouraging because it indicates that existing monitoring and sanctions are working, but distressing because existing efforts have apparently only slowed Iran's activities. He stated that he will pass the information to the Central Bank and encourage them to increase vigilance for prohibited activities. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** HENZEL
