¶1. (U) Acting Pol/Econ Chief July 12 met with Ministry of 
Industry and Commerce Assistant Undersecretary for Foreign 
Trade Ahmed Bubshait and Director of Foreign Trade Relations 
Eman Al-Doseri at Undersecretary Bubshait's request, for 
follow-up discussion of subject demarche delivered July 2 
(Ref A). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Undersecretary Bubshait opened by noting positive 
relations between Bahrain and the U.S.  He said he was 
surprised by the demarche reference to Bahrain's having taken 
a "less pragmatic position" during Committee on Trade and 
Environment in Special Session (CTESS) negotiations (Ref. B). 
 "Our delegation did not register an opinion." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Director Al-Doseri elaborated.  "Our delegation head 
informed me that he never raised his flag on this issue.  He 
was very surprised to hear about this."  She noted that the 
U.S. demarche implied that the GoB had been supportive of 
India's "project-based" approach.  "We are not in favor of a 
project-based approach.  We support a product-based 
approach." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Undersecretary Bubshait and Director Al-Doseri each 
requested details regarding what GoB actions had led to U.S. 
criticism of the GoB position.
