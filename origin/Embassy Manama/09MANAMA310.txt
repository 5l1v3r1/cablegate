SUBJECT: FIRST CASE OF H1N1 CONFIRMED IN BAHRAIN 
 
¶1.  (U) On May 26, Ministry of Health Spokesman Adel Ali 
Abdulla told econoff that the ministry had identified the 
first confirmed case of the H1N1 virus in Bahrain.  The 
ministry followed published protocols to isolate the patient 
and test others who may have been exposed.  The ministry has 
placed a team at the international airport to assist 
immigration officials, but no new screening procedures have 
been introduced as a result of the case. 
 
¶2. (U) The infected person--a 21 year old Bahraini 
student--returned on May 23 from a trip to New York along 
with 75 other students.  The patient is currently under 
quarantine at the Salmaniya Medical Center in Manama where he 
is being treated with Tamiflu and is reportedly recovering 
well.  Local dailies reported that the student had gone to a 
local medical clinic complaining of flu-like symptoms soon 
after his return but was released.  He later went to 
Salmaniya as his symptoms continued to worsen.  The Ministry 
of Health issued a statement urging all travelers to contact 
the ministry's hotline as soon as they feel any flu-like 
symptoms particularly if returning from abroad.
