1.(SBU) Charge delivered ref C points to MFA A/US Abdulaziz Al Khalifa on August 12. Al Khalifa thanked Charge for the advice on how to combat trafficking in persons. He praised IOM's collaborative efforts to train Interior Ministry officials, and welcomed additional training opportunities for the judiciary (ref B). Al Khalifa was appointed head of the new inter-ministerial policy committee called for in Bahrain's January 2008 anti-trafficking legislation. He said that the Minister of Social Development would order the creation of an implementation committee shortly.

2.(SBU) Al Khalifa said that the GOB and the Suzanne Mubarak Women's International Peace Movement had set November 15-17 as the dates for their joint regionally-focused anti-trafficking in persons conference (refs A and B). He anticipated invitees will include labor officials from sending countries, the Arab world, international partners, and the U.S. Al Khalifa promised to provide post with drafts of the program and invitee list once they are approved. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** HENZEL
