Â¶1. (U) EconOff delivered reftel talking points to Dr. Khalid 
Abdulla Ateeq, Executive Director of Banking Supervision at 
the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA).  Bahrain does not have an 
Export Credit Authority, and therefore could not enter into a 
framework agreement with the Trade Bank of Iraq.  However, 
Dr. Ateeq did note that private banks in Bahrain are free to 
(and he believes have already) provide financing for firms 
doing business in Iraq.  He also pointed to ongoing efforts 
by the GOB, particularly the BMA, to support Iraqi 
reconstruction through training programs in banking and 
capital market supervision and promoting the efforts of 
several private banks in Bahrain to open branches in Iraq.
