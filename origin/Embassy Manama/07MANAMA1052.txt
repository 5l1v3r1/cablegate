¶1. (U) The trial of five suspects charged under Bahrain's 
2006 counter-terrorism law (reftels) resumed November 20 in 
Manama's High Criminal Court.  The prosecution and defense 
presented opening arguments, and the court adjourned until 
December 12. 
 
¶2. (U) Defense attorneys told media that the three defendants 
currently in custody (two are being tried in absentia) began 
a hunger strike on November 17 seeking release on bail.  The 
judge denied the bail request on November 20, and the 
attorneys said their clients will continue their hunger 
strike. 
 
¶3. (U) The defendants once again appeared in an open session 
of the court.  Their families and supporters were present in 
the courtroom along with media.
