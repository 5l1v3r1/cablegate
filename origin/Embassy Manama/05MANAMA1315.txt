¶1.  (SBU) Pol/Econ chief September 11 delivered reftel 
demarche concerning U.S. views of the "Declaration on 
Innovative Sources of Financing for Development" to MFA 
Director for International Organization Affairs Ghassan 
Shaikho.  Shaikho was surprised to hear about this initiative 
and wondered aloud why representatives of the sponsoring 
governments -- Algeria, Brazil, Chile, France, Germany, and 
Spain -- had not contacted the GOB.  He thought perhaps they 
were not serious about the Declaration and may have proposed 
it as a trial balloon. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Shaikho understood our position and agreed that the 
Declaration did not sound like a good idea.  The 
International Finance Facility would seemingly duplicate 
instruments of existing international financial institutions 
without providing any additional value added.  He pledged to 
inform the Bahraini mission to the UN in New York of our 
views.
