¶1. (U) NEA/ARP Office Director Alan Misenheimer and Econoff 
February 14 delivered reftel demarche concerning the threat 
posed by cash couriers and bulk cash smuggling used to 
finance terrorism and other illicit activity to Central Bank 
of Bahrain (CBB) Director of Financial Institution 
Supervision Abdul-Rahman Mohammed Al-Baker, Head of 
Compliance Directorate Ahmed Bumtaia and Compliance Unit 
Analyst Bushra Al-Haddad. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Al-Baker said regulations implementing Article 5 of 
Bahrain's Anti-Money Laundering Law, which addresses cash 
couriers, were being finalized and would be completed in 
coming weeks.  Bumtaia added that these regulations were 
comprehensive and reflected collaboration with every relevant 
government entity, including Customs and the Ministries of 
Finance, Industry and Commerce. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Al-Haddad noted that Bahrain's imminent 
implementation of cash courier regulations was consistent 
with the GOB's desire to protect its strong banking 
reputation.  She noted that Bahrain had recently reviewed its 
mutual evaluation with MENA-FATF and that the results of the 
evaluation had just been published on the CBB's website, 
www.cbb.gov.bh.  She said that the MENA-FATF and the IMF were 
also expected to publish the evaluation soon. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Director Misenheimer noted that Bahrain's record on 
banking oversight presents a commendable story and solicited 
Bahrain's continued close cooperation.  "Rest assured," 
responded Al-Haddad, "we will do everything in our power" to 
maintain Bahrain's high banking regulatory standards. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Director Misenheimer and EconOff also delivered 
reftel demarche to the Ministry of Interior Economic Crime 
Directorate's Anti-Money Laundering Unit (AMLU) Director 
Captain Bassam Al-Miraj.  (Note: The AMLU is the U.S. FINCEN 
equivalent.  It is responsible for investigating suspicious 
transactions, money laundering and terrorist finance cases 
but does not have regulatory authority.  End Note.)  Al-Miraj 
pledged his support and echoed the CBB's description of the 
status of regulations to implement cash courier provisions of 
Bahrain's Anti-Money Laundering Law.
