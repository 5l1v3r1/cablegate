SUBJECT: U.S. ENGAGEMENT WITH BAHRAIN ON NUCLEAR ENERGY COOPERATION AND NUCLEAR TERRORISM INITIATIVES 

REF: STATE 24234 Classified By: Ambassador Adam Ereli for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

1.(S) Poloff delivered reftel amended draft MOU to MFA Legal Adviser Dr. Yousif Abdulkarim on March 10. He shared a fax he had received from Ambassador Belooshi on March 7 with an identical version of the draft. Dr. Yousif reviewed the amended language and said that it addressed GOB concerns about the Safeguards Agreement ratification process.

2.(C) Poloff also delivered the Global Initiative (GI) non-paper, explained the complementary nature of the MOU and the GI, and urged the GOB to endorse the GI in a diplomatic note. Dr. Yousif declared that "a diplomatic note will be no problem," adding that cooperation with the U.S. on nuclear issues had the "full support of the King, the Prime Minister, and the Crown Prince." He looked briefly at the proposed GI Letter of Endorsement and said he didn't immediately see any problems with the draft, but that he would review it in detail and let us know if he felt any changes were needed.

3.(C) Dr. Yousif went on to say that the GOB was very interested in the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) and would welcome an invitation to the next GNEP meeting as a "Candidate Country." This would give Bahrain an opportunity to evaluate the GNEP as it contemplated endorsement of the Statement of Principles and full partner status.

4.(C) He reiterated that Bahrain was eager to begin technical and legal cooperation as outlined by Ambassador Wolcott during the March 7 meeting with Ambassador Belooshi (reftel). ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI
