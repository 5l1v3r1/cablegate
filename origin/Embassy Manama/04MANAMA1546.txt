¶1.  Blue Lantern designated point of contact is 
Economic/Commercial Officer Aimee Cutrona. She can be reached 
through the Embassy switchboard at: (973) 1724-2700, at the 
office: (973) 1724-2986; via fax: (973) 1727-3011; or email: 
CutronaA@state.gov. 
 
¶2.  To date Embassy Manama has not received a significant 
number of requests to conduct Blue Lantern Checks.  PM/DTCC 
records indicate that the last request was in 2000.  While 
officers currently at post do not have experience in 
conducting these checks in Bahrain, there is every reason to 
believe a check can be completed within thirty days.  The 
Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) has provided model cooperation in 
the DSCA's Golden Sentry Program, and Embassy officers enjoy 
a close working relationship with the Ministry of the 
Interior.
