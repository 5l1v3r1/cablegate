country and no other country has sovereignty over it. 
 
¶7. (U) In his July 15 editorial, editor of the Shia-oriented 
daily Al-Wasat, Mansour Al-Jamri, praised Muttaqi's statement 
to the press in Bahrain and urged Bahrainis to forget the 
past and encourage future development between the two 
countries.  He welcomed the formation of a joint committee to 
develop areas of future cooperation. 
 
¶8. (U) Bu June 16, the tempest created by the Shariatmadari 
seemed to have subsided.  The story was off the front pages, 
except for one small article reporting that the Iranian MFA 
spokesman had reiterated in his weekly news conference that 
Shariatmadari's statement represented his personal view only 
and not that of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, and that Iran 
respects Bahraini sovereignty and will continue to have good 
relations with Bahrain. Also reported was a day trip Shaikh 
Khalid took to Saudi Arabia to brief King Abdullah on the 
affair. 
 
¶8. (C) Comment: Muttaqi's visit has predictably quieted the 
local storm that developed over Shariatmadari's ill-timed 
statement.  Nonetheless, the statement, in hitting a raw 
nerve, aroused the worst fears in Bahrain's Sunni community, 
especially among those inclined to distrust Iran in 
particular and Shia in general.  The statements of the 
leading Shia cleric and Shia journalist are telling.  Shaikh 
Isa Qassim wanted to make clear Shia loyalty to Bahrain, and 
Mansour Al-Jamry wanted to get the whole thing over with as 
quickly as possible.  They saw no benefit in this for the 
Bahraini Shia.  As for Bahrain's relations with Iran, the 
government predictably felt that, once it had made its point, 
it had no choice but to seek accommodation with its large and 
potentially threatening neighbor to the north.
