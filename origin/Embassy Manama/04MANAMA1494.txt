REF: STATE 184238 
 
¶1.  Expiration of the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing 
(ATC) will likely have a small negative impact on the 
Bahraini economy because the textile and apparel sector is a 
relatively minor contributor to the gross domestic product. 
However, the potential for layoffs in the textile sector is a 
potent political issue because of the preponderance of Shia 
women among the approximately 3,700 Bahrainis employed in the 
apparel sector.  Unemployment has traditionally had a 
disproportionate impact on the Shia community, which 
represents some 70 percent of the country's population.  Some 
Bahrainis believe that the recently signed U.S.-Bahrain Free 
Trade Agreement could actually lead to an expansion of the 
sector as investors seek to benefit from tariff-free entry of 
textiles and apparel into the U.S.
