Classified By: Ambassador Adam Ereli for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

1.(SBU) The High Criminal Court January 16 announced guilty verdicts against the five defendants charged with membership in a terrorist organization, undergoing terrorist training, facilitating the travel of others abroad to receive terrorist training, and financing terrorism under the 2006 counter-terrorism law. Ishaaq Faheem Ishaaq Abd al-Rahman, Abdulrahman Mohammad Jaffar Ali, and Ali Eid Muttar Jassim were each sentenced to six months in prison, with credit for time served. Ishaaq, Jaffar, and Jassim have been in custody since August and could go free in a matter of days. Co-defendants Mohammad Abdulkareem Al-Khan and Khalifa Al-Subayi were tried in absentia and remain at large.

2.(C) An embassy contact XXXXXXXXXXXX(protect) confirmed the verdicts against the five.

3.(C) Chief Prosecutor Nawaf Al-Mouada told Poloff that both the prosecution and defense have two weeks in which to file an appeal. He explained that the prosecution must base any appeal on the legal reasoning of the verdict. It may not appeal the sentence in and of itself. Al-Mouada said that the Attorney General would study the verdict closely before deciding whether to file an appeal. Poloff asked whether he was surprised by either the verdicts or the sentences, and Al-Mouada said he had expected the convictions, but that he thought the sentences would be "a little longer."

4.(C) Comment: Ishaaq, Jaffar, and Jassim were all arrested in early August 2007. With credit for time served, they could all be released within a week or two. Though obtaining convictions under the new counter-terrorism law marks a step forward, the light sentences dull the shine of that achievement. Post will report further developments as the prosecution weighs its options for an appeal. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI
