REF: STATE 190889 
 
¶1. (SBU) RSO provides security assistance and advice to the 
Bahrain School (34 USG dependents) and St. Christopher's 
School (4 USG dependents) in Manama.  RSO Manama has 
established procedures for school administrators to contact 
MSG Post 1 via landline and/or cell phone in case of 
emergency. 
 
2, (SBU) Bahrain Public Security provides armed patrols in 
the areas around both schools, on foot and in mobile units. 
The Government of Bahrain continues to provide effective 
safety and security measures for these schools. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Bahrain School is a Department of Defense School 
administered by the Naval Support Activity (NSA) Bahrain 
(co-located with U.S. Naval Central Command 5th Fleet 
Headquarters). Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), 
Naval Security Forces and local guards, paid for by the NSA, 
provide security for the school and bus transportation, and 
conduct emergency training.  NCIS provides security briefings 
for teachers and administrators.  RSO is involved in the 
overall security planning for the Bahrain School, but NCIS 
and the Navy have primary responsibility.  Emergency plans 
from the Bahrain School are very comprehensive 
 
¶4. (SBU) St. Christopher's School is an independent school, 
based on the British education system.  RSO met with school 
administrators and offered assistance and training.  The 
school has not yet accepted our offer.  A local guard company 
provides security at the school along with police patrols. 
The school is aware of terrorist/crime threats and takes 
security very seriously.  The School's emergency plans have 
been discussed with RSO and appear to be effective. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Section 1500 of the Emergency Action Plan provides 
information on the Bahrain School.
