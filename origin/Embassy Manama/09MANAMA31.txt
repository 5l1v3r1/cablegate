SUBJECT: INPUT FOR CHILD LABOR REPORT 
 
REF: 08 STATE 127448 
 
¶1. Summary: Child labor in Bahrain is infrequent, and tends 
to be in family-owned and -operated shops.  The GOB did not 
amend statutes pertaining to child labor.  There were no 
reports of children involved in trafficking, slavery, or 
slavery-like conditions.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. The following responses are keyed to queries in reftel 
para 9.  The GOB has not changed laws pertaining to child 
labor since March 2008. 
 
¶A. The labor law of 1976 continues to generally prohibit the 
employment of children under the age of 16.  Juveniles 
between ages 14 and 16 may obtain official authorization to 
work from the Ministry of Labor if they can prove an urgent 
need to provide financial support for their families. 
Juveniles who obtain such permission may work no more than 
six hours per day with a one hour minimum rest period. 
Minors may not work overtime, nor in industries deemed 
hazardous or unhealthy by the Ministry of Health.  These 
regulations do not pertain to employment where the only other 
employees are family members.  The law also prohibits forced 
and compulsory labor.  The comprehensive Anti-Trafficking Law 
of 2008 stipulates increased fines and jail terms for 
trafficking of minors.  In 2007, there was no comprehensive 
anti-trafficking law, although one was passed in January, 
¶2008.  The law prohibits any violation of public morals, 
which includes prostitution and pornography.  The law 
stipulates that the minimum age for mi 
litary recruitment is 18 years. 
 
¶B. The law holds employers, supervisors, and guardians 
responsible for minors who violate the prohibitions, and 
authorizes a fine of between 50 and 200 Bahraini Dinars (130 
and 530 USD) for each violation.  The government provides its 
43 labor investigators with training to monitor and enforce 
the laws regarding child labor.  No child labor violations 
have been reported, although there have been instances of 
underage migrant workers allegedly lying about their age to 
secure employment.  The government does not devote 
significant resources to investigating child labor cases. 
 
¶C. The government does not devote resources specifically to 
prevent or withdraw children from the worst forms of child 
labor. 
 
¶D. Education is free and compulsory in law and practice, and 
widely attended.  The government cites the lack of a child 
labor problem as its cause for not having a comprehensive 
policy to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. 
 
¶E. Statistics on child labor were not available.  Working 
juveniles were found in small numbers, typically at their 
parents' shops.  This does not represent a change from the 
previous year.
