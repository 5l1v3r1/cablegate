--------------- 
TFCO AND DEPUTY 
--------------- 
 
¶1. Embassy Manama TFCO is Econoff Stephen Simpson, phone: 
(973)1724-2986, unclassified email: SimpsonSC@state.gov, and 
classified email: SimpsonSC@state.sgov.gov. 
 
¶2. Deputy TFCO is OFAC Attache Jason Beal, phone:

classified email: BealJR@state.sgov.gov.

TFCO COORDINATION 
----------------- 
 
¶3. Post would welcome regional TFCO meetings to improve 
coordination among TFCO's, as suggested reftel.  Such 
meetings could feature representation from TFCOs, Washington 
policy officials, and law-enforcement and banking officials, 
as appropriate.  TFCO names and contact information should be 
distributed, allowing TFCOs to readily identify and reach out 
to counterparts. 
 
¶4. Post enjoys excellent State - Treasury/OFAC interaction. 
Econoff and OFAC attache, who is present at post, coordinate 
closely and Econoff provides back-up support for OFAC Attache 
when he travels, maintaining communication with host 
government on time-sensitive issues.  An effort should be 
made to invite TFCO participation at OFAC, FinCen and other 
relevant USG conferences in the interest of enhanced 
networking and information exchange. 
 
---------------- 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
---------------- 
 
¶5. The Bahrain Monetary Agency and the Ministry of Interior's 
Economic Crime Directorate each have public outreach 
programs.  In addition, Bahrain hosts the MENA-FATF.  USG 
recognition of and continued Public Affairs support for these 
initiatives, in the way of Washington-generated fact sheets, 
op-eds, and local press events, is beneficial. 
 
------------- 
NEEDS OF POST 
------------- 
 
¶6. Post commends the EB/Terrorism Finance and Economic 
Sanctions intranet site for its broad inclusion of resources. 
 Post's local interlocutors are English-speaking, yet 
Department-provided Arabic translations of talking points and 
other materials have been warmly received and are culturally 
appreciated.  Washington's continued efforts to maintain and 
expand such resources would be useful to us. 
 
¶7.  As noted above, Post requests contact information for 
regional TFCOs.  Front-channel best practices TFCO guidance, 
perhaps drawing on worldwide feedback to reftel, would also 
be useful.
