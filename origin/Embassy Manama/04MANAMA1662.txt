¶1.  (SBU) Pol/Econ chief October 30 delivered Ref A demarche 
concerning the state of play on the Costa Rica resolution on 
cloning to MFA Director for International Organization 
Affairs Ghassan Shaikho.  Shaikho was interested to hear that 
Saudi Arabia will vote in favor of the resolution and 
commented that the SAG must have obtained an opinion (fatwa) 
from Saudi religious scholars in favor of banning all forms 
of human cloning.  If this was the case, the GOB would review 
the fatwa and possibly also make use of it in justifying a 
vote in favor of the Costa Rica resolution.  The GOB had 
still not received a fatwa from Bahrain's Ministry of Islamic 
Affairs (Ref B).  He stated that Bahrain always coordinates 
its UN votes with Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries. 
Shaikho said he would pass the information to Bahrain's 
mission to the UN and get an update.
