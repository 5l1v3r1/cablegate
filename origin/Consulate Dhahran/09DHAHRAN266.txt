CLASSIFIED BY: Joseph Kenny, Dhahran Consul General, Department 
of State. 
REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 
SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) Three prominent local Shia report that economic 
marginalization, combined with religious discrimination, are 
generating increased frustration in the Eastern Province (EP). 
This is compounded by a growing generation gap in the Shia 
community with an impatient younger generation inclined to 
protest their plight loudly and more openly than their 
circumspect elders. Symbolic but empty gestures by the SAG are 
doing little to placate popular anger.  The perceived regional 
growth of Shia power is affecting the youth as well, 
crystallizing an attitude of "us" vs. "them."  END SUMMARY. 
 
The "Have Nots" 
 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (C/NF) On 12 October, PolOffs and PDOff met with XXXXXXXXXXXX(protect), Vice-President of the XXXXXXXXXXXX; XXXXXXXXXXXX(protect), XXXXXXXXXXXX Council Member; and 
XXXXXXXXXXXX(protect), the XXXXXXXXXXXX.  They described the ongoing sentiment in the 
Shia community as one of mounting frustration.  The lack of 
economic opportunities and viable employment options for Shia, 
especially the youth, remains unchanged.  Low university 
admission rates despite strong exam scores is also a point of 
contention.  Although poverty itself is not rampant, economic 
marginalization adds a layer of frustration to the 
government-imposed religious discrimination of Shia in KSA. 
 
Religious Discrimination 
 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C/NF) Religious discrimination could be the catalyst for 
radicalization.  The closure of mosques, the prohibition of 
public display of Shia rituals and gatherings, and the denial of 
access to burial grounds and ceremony, are the most inflammatory 
issues in the Shia community.  Continued discrimination, 
according to XXXXXXXXXXXX (protect), could lead to radicalism 
in the EP.  XXXXXXXXXXXX recently 
reported (16 OCT) that after a Ramadan lull, Saudi authorities 
issued orders to close two Shia mosques in Dammam city after an 
uptick in mosque closures in the nearby city of Khobar (for more 
details on the Khobar mosque closing see ref A).  Additionally, 
sectarian arrests and mosque closures in al-Ahsa have drawn the 
ire of Saudi Shia (see ref B for background on sectarian tension 
in al-Ahsa). 
 
¶4. (C/NF) The closure of religious centers affects those 
preparing for religious vocations, thus creating the need to 
travel abroad for advanced religious education.  Qom, Iran is 
often mentioned as a top destination for religious education. 
In fact, XXXXXXXXXXXX (protect) recently returned from Qom 
himself, where he traveled for religious study.  Although he is 
quick to dismiss any affection for Ayatollah Khamenei, he 
mentioned being criticized on conservative Salafi websites for 
his time in Iran. 
 
The Growing Divide 
 
------------------ 
 
¶5. (C/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX (protect) spoke at length on the 
growing generation gap in the Shia community between reticent 
older members and  an impatient younger generation inclined  to 
protest their plight loudly and more openly, with disregard for 
consequences such as imprisonment.  He went so far as to say 
that their frustration is turning to hopelessness and 
exasperation, particularly as it pertains to a lack of religious 
freedom.  Isa noted that such sentiments could be exploited by 
radicals. 
 
¶6.  (C/NF) Vocal religious leaders such as Sayed Mohammad 
Al-Nasser reflect Shia frustrations and thus command a growing 
following in the EP.  Rasid.com recently (08 OCT) reported that 
Al-Nasser, the Friday Prayers' Imam in Khobar City, vowed to 
continue performing Shia prayers despite the Saudi authorities' 
ban.  Al-Nasser nevertheless stated that Shia are currently 
waiting in anticipation for a royal decree by King Abdullah to 
resolve the issue on mosque closures.  A high level Shia 
delegation from Khobar met King Abdullah on 19 July to brief him 
about the mosque closures.  Despite promises to look into the 
matter, several well-informed contacts have not received any 
response on the issue. 
 
Token Gestures 
 
-------------- 

¶7. (C/NF) The SAG's consent to Shia involvement in local 
politics is not likely to mitigate current frustrations in the 
Shia community.  Although the SAG has taken measured steps 
toward the inclusion of minorities in local politics, these 
steps have done little to placate the frustrations of the Shia 
community.  XXXXXXXXXXXX (protect) emphasized that only an 
easing of religious discrimination will stifle the potential for 
radicalism.  The Shia community's lack of freedom in exercising 
their spirituality is a major source of indignation.  Hence, 
those who wish to espouse radical viewpoints may find an 
increasingly larger audience in the Shia community.  Suffice it 
to say that the three Shia activists present at this meeting 
believe that religious freedom is more important than political 
inclusion for Shia of the EP. 
 
REGIONAL SHIA RESURGENCE SPURS DEMANDS FOR RIGHTS 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶8. (C/NF) The perceived Shia "revival" elsewhere in the region 
is emboldening the Shia community.  XXXXXXXXXXXX (protect) 
noted that international media outlets keep the Shia communities 
of the EP well informed.  Many, especially the youth, are 
inspired by what they regard as Shia successes in Iraq and 
Lebanon and, hence are encouraged to demand greater rights. 
Hussein did not go so far as to suggest that Shias in KSA are 
receiving assistance from abroad. 
 
COMMENT 
 
------- 
 
¶9. (C/NF) The Shia of the EP have long been subject to religious 
discrimination and economic marginalization.  At times, 
sentiments have erupted into open protest, resulting in 
bloodshed.  It is important to note that such events occurred 
spontaneously, like in Medina (ref C), and without extensive 
coordination.  END COMMENT.
