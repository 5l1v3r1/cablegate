SUBJECT: SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ACHIEVED DURING FOURTH ROUND 
OF COLOMBIA DCA TALKS 

REF: BOGOTA 01334

SUMMARY 
-------- 
¶1. (C) U.S. and Colombian delegations made swift and 
significant progress during the fourth round of Defense 
Cooperation Agreement (DCA) talks, held in Bogota on June 
23-25.  The two sides reached nearly complete agreement on 
roughly eighty percent of the DCA text.  President Uribe's 
instructions to his delegation to press ahead quickly paid 
clear dividends, as the GOC team showed increased flexibility 
on several key issues.  Foreign Minister Bermudez expressed 
optimism that the few remaining substantive issues could be 
quickly overcome.  The fifth and possibly final round of 
talks is scheduled to take place in Washington D.C. on July 
29-31.  A detailed list of the status of the DCA's twenty-six 
articles is included in paragraph seven below.  End summary. 

DCA ROUND FOUR 
-------------- 
¶2. (C) The U.S. and Colombian delegations convened in Bogota 
on June 23-25 for the fourth round of negotiations on the 
DCA.  Deputy Foreign Minister ClemenciaForero, Deputy 
Defense Minister Juan Pinzon, and Deputy Defense Minister 
Sergio Jaramillo led the Colombian delegation.  PM Senior 
Advisor Ambassador Jackson McDonald headed the U.S. 
delegation comprised of State and DOD representatives. 


URIBE'S PRESSURE YIELDS DIVIDENDS 
--------------------------------- 
¶3. (C) The three Colombian Vice Ministers began the talks by 
stressing President Uribe's emphatic instructions to his 
delegation to move ahead as quickly as possible.  This 
pressure paid clear dividends at the negotiating table, as 
the GOC team showed much greater flexibility than in the past 
and made a number of concessions on key provisions, such as 
the ability of USG personnel to carry weapons.  The two 
delegations made swift and significant progress, reaching 
nearly complete agreement on the text of 20 of the 
agreement's 26 articles.  A detailed list of the status of 
the DCA articles is included in paragraph 7 below. 

FEW STICKING POINTS REMAIN 
-------------------------- 
¶4. (C) The following substantive issues remain to be resolved 
in the DCA:  a) payment of fees and other charges for U.S. 
vehicles, aircraft and vessels in Article VI; b) the ability 
of the USG to exercise UCMJ jurisdiction and conduct courts 
martial in Colombian territory in Article VIII; c) tax and 
customs treatment in Article X; d) freedom of movement of USG 
personnel in Article XI; and e) claims related to USG 
contractors in Article XX.  The delegations identified 
possible solutions for several of these provisions and plan 
to discuss them in a technical meeting prior to the next 
plenary negotiation. 

FOREIGN MINISTER OPTIMISTIC 
--------------------------- 
¶5. (C) In a closing meeting on June 25, Colombian Foreign 
Minister Jaime Bermudez congratulated the delegations for the 
progress achieved during Round IV and expressed optimism that 
the remaining issues could be resolved.  He emphasized that 
there is great political will on the part of the GOC to 
conclude an agreement, and noted that President Uribe plans 
to raise the DCA with President Obama during their meeting in 
Washington on June 29. 

NEXT STEPS 
---------- 
¶6. (C) The delegations agreed to meet for a fifth round of 
DCA negotiations in Washington on July 29-31.  Time will tell 
whether this next round will suffice to resolve the remaining 
differences, which are small in number but difficult in 
substantive terms.  The two sides also agreed to form a 
technical working group to discuss possible solutions to the 
remaining issues during the week of July 6.
