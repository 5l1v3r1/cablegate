SUBJECT: UAVS -- "EYES IN THE SKY" FOR COLMIL OPERATIONS 

Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood 
Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d) 


------- 
Summary 
------- 

¶1. (S)  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a low-tech, 
low-cost, and low-risk but potentially high-impact new 
addition to USG-GOC intelligence cooperation in support of 
counterterror and counterdrug efforts.  Since their arrival 
in July, a test package of UAVs has provided valuable, 
real-time aerial video reconnaissance and surveillance to 
live COLMIL operations.  The UAV program's principal 
priorities are to support U.S. hostage rescue efforts and to 
assist COLMIL pursuit of FARC leaders, but it promises to be 
equally useful for combat against terrorists and in riverine 
drug interdiction.  As with all intelligence capabilities, 
what matters most is its aggressive application by the COLMIL 
in offensive action.  End Summary. 

---------------------------------- 
Remote Control Aerial Surveillance 
---------------------------------- 

¶2. (C)  "ScanEagle" is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that 
transmits real-time video imagery as it overflies targets. 
Just four feet long with a ten-foot wingspan, it is too small 
to be seen or heard when cruising above 3000 feet, yet from 
that height its camera zooms in clearly on vehicles and 
structures below.  Its operation is basic: a ground-based 
'pilot' navigates with a 'joy stick' and keyboard; and a 
technician launches and retrieves the craft without a runway 
via a device operable in a clearing on land or ship. 
Operating costs are low: each 40-pound craft is able to fly 
or loiter up to 15 hours nonstop on 5.5 liters of fuel, has a 
transmission range of nearly 70 miles, and can operate in 
heavy winds and weather.  (Detailed specs are publicly 
available at: http://www.insitu.com/prod scaneagle.cfm.) 

------------------------- 
Job #1: Hostages and HVTs 
------------------------- 

¶3. (S)  UAVs have proven useful before, during, and after 
strikes against the FARC.  In the planning stage, they 
provide updated reconnaissance imagery of target sites 
previously identified by human and signals intelligence. 
Prior to launch, the COLAF deploys UAVs to target sites to 
assess weather patterns before putting bombers in the air. 
The UAVs then keep their cameras trained on targets to ensure 
identification until planes arrive.  Loitering UAVs give 
commanders a real-time, bird's-eye view of COLMIL assaults, 
enabling them to review pilots' accuracy and to provide 
battle damage assessments.  When inserting troops at enemy 
sites, the COLAR uses the UAV for force protection and as a 
lookout in case of anti-aircraft threats to its helicopters. 
After strikes are over, UAVs can continue site surveillance, 
watching for enemy survivors and their escape routes. 

¶4. (S)  UAVs are better suited to 'point' or 'line' 
reconnaissance (pre-designated sites and structures or rivers 
and roads) than to broad, ad hoc, 'area' sweeps.  They are 
meant to supplement but not substitute for humint / sigint 
leads.  Still, opportunistic events can occur.  When a UAV 
'pilot' flew by chance over a truck unloading FARC fighters, 
and the COLAF happened to have a bomber available nearby, an 
aerial assault was launched within 30 minutes.  Similarly, 
when a UAV caught two vehicles being loaded with coca, a 
helicopter gunship was quickly dispatched and destroyed them. 
 Such stationary targets on open roads are good cases for UAV 
use, whereas targets beneath jungle canopy impenetrable to 
the human eye require more sophisticated platforms. 

--------------------- 
Riverine Interdiction 
--------------------- 

¶5. (S)  UAVs are ideal for surveillance and interdiction of 
drug traffic along river networks, especially in the border 
regions of southern and eastern Colombia and along the 
Pacific coast.  A target can be fixed and followed 
downstream, to be intercepted by COLMAR 'piranha' boats. 
This optimizes the use of scarce riverine resources, enabling 
them to nab a located target rather than to lie in wait for 
the enemy or conduct open-ended river sweeps.  In some cases 
the COLMAR need not expend any of its resources.  When a UAV 
tracked a coca-loaded boat down river to a pier stop, the UAV 
team alerted the local town police to board the boat and 
search its cargo.  Monitoring narco-boat movements and 
stopping points can also direct counterdrug forces to 
locations of coca caches (caletas). 

--------------------------- 
Very Useful -- If Used Well 
--------------------------- 

¶6. (C)  UAVs offer a range of potential benefits to the 
COLMIL: 

- Reduced risk to personnel: the UAV 'pilot' controls the 
craft from the security of the base, with no risk of human 
casualty or hostage capture. 

- Expanded intelligence collection: overflight capability 
accesses more remote areas, and stealth above 3000 feet 
evades enemy detection. 

- Force multiplier effect: conducting surveillance with an 
unmanned craft frees up troops for offensive action. 

- Asset optimization: low-tech 'drones' spare usage of more 
high-maintenance assets like helicopters or piranha boats. 

- Lower mission cost: UAVs are cheap to operate, maintain, 
and fix compared to any other ISR platform. 

¶7. (C)  The COLMIL is in the process of developing joint 
doctrine for the use of UAVs.  At present, that doctrine is 
in its infancy and is not yet included in the operational 
commanders' planning process.  Moreover, Colombian operators 
still depend on support from Boeing coaches.  U.S. training 
will be extended until the Colombians become capable of 
operating on their own.  Additional training and effective 
implementation of UAV capabilities will expand operational 
and tactical intelligence exploitation opportunities, but an 
effective outcome will require aggressive COLMIL action.
