SUBJECT: URIBE REAFFIRMS OPPOSITION TO DEMILITARIZED ZONE 
FOR FARC 
 
REF: BOGOTA 8001 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor John S. Creamer. 
Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) President Uribe reiterated his opposition to a 
demilitarized zone ("despeje") in talks with the FARC, and 
ruled out a meeting between Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez 
and senior FARC leader Manuel Marulanda. In his November 8 
meeting with Chavez, FARC Secretariat member Ivan Marquez had 
called for a Chavez-Marulanda meeting in Colombia, repeated 
the FARC demand for a demilitarized zone, and said the FARC 
would provide proof of life for the hostages.  GOC High 
Commissioner for Peace and the Minister of Interior said the 
GOC would not support an endless round of Chavez-FARC 
negotiations. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 13, President Alvaro Uribe underscored 
the GOC's commitment to negotiating a humanitarian accord 
with the FARC, but reiterated his opposition to a 
demilitarized zone ("despeje"). He also ruled out a meeting 
between Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and octogenarian 
FARC leader Manuel Marulanda in the Yari, a region in 
southeast Colombia historically dominated by the FARC. Uribe 
said the "only meeting we want for Marulanda is with police, 
prosecutors and judges."  He noted that GOC had already shown 
its openness to a humanitarian accord by releasing more than 
170 FARC, including Rodrigo Granda, earlier this year -- a 
gesture that has gone unanswered by the FARC. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Uribe's statement was prompted by Chavez' insistence 
on a Chavez-Marulanda meeting after his November 8 meeting in 
Miraflores presidential palace with FARC Secretariat member 
Ivan Marquez. Marquez had proposed that such a meeting be 
held in Colombia, and reiterated the FARC's calls for a 
"despeje" for humanitarian exchange. In an October 31 letter 
to Senator Piedad Cordoba, Marquez praised statements by FARC 
members Sonia and Simon Trinidad--currently serving time in 
U.S. prison--that they do not want to be an obstacle to 
accord, but insisted they must be included in any deal. 
Marquez called their extradition to the U.S. an act of 
"treachery" by Uribe. He said Marulanda has given the order 
to provide Chavez with proof of life of for Ingrid 
Betancourt, the three Americans, and the other hostages. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Colombian High Commissioner for Peace Luis Carlos 
Restrepo said on November 14 in Madrid that Chavez' mediation 
in a humanitarian swap was an important development, but 
Chavez' meeting with Marquez in Venezuela  - which the GOC 
was not informed of beforehand - proves a "despeje" in 
Colombia is not needed for negotiations.  He added that the 
"despeje" option was a "closed door."  Minister of Interior 
and Justice Carlos Holguin echoed Restrepo's comments, adding 
that Venezuela's involvement, although made in good faith, 
cannot be indefinite or allowed to take over the 
negotiations.  Restrepo traveled from Madrid to Caracas where 
he meet with ELN leaders and GOC officials. 
 
¶5. (C) The press reports that the FARC will provide proof of 
life to Chavez before his November 20 trip to Paris.  Cordoba 
has publicly suggested that she has proof of life for the 
three Americans and will provide it to U.S. officials on 
November 16. Control Risk official Robert Froude told us 
November 14 that his company--which was hired by Northrop 
Grumman to work on the case of the three Americans--has been 
communicating independently for some time with Colombian 
journalist Jorge Botero to produce proof of life. Botero, an 
associate of Cordoba who interviewed the three Americans in 
2003, has told Control Risk he has the "green light" from 
FARC leaders to film the U.S. hostages.  Froude said it is 
unclear how Botero's efforts track with those of Cordoba.
