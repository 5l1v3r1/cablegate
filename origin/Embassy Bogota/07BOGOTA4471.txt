SUBJECT: PARA-POLITICAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK NOT ON LEGISLATIVE 
FAST TRACK 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor John S. Creamer. 
Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) Presidential Legal Advisor Mauricio Gonzalez told 
polcouns June 15 the GOC proposal to provide for reduced, 
alternative sentences for politicians, front men 
(testaferros), ranchers, and others who were linked to the 
paramilitaries but were not United Self-Defense Forces of 
Colombia (AUC) members nor involved in atrocities is not on a 
legislative fast track.  The GOC has yet to decide if it will 
introduce legislation in the next Congressional session, 
which starts on July 20, but Gonzalez continues to work on a 
possible bill. 
 
¶2.  (C) Gonzalez said Uribe has made clear he is not looking 
for an amnesty; he wants a bill that would provide for 
reduced sentences (3-5 years) conditioned on reparations and 
full confessions.  Individuals who received the reduced 
sentences would be required to serve some jail time and would 
be subject to a lifetime ban from participating in politics. 
Gonzalez said if the bill went forward, it would introduce 
proportionality between the sentences served by paramilitary 
collaborators and the time served by paramilitary leaders 
guilty of atrocities.  He said it would be unjust for an 
individual who helped the paramilitaries under duress to 
serve more time than an individual guilty of multiple 
massacres. 
 
¶3.  (C) Meanwhile, lawyers for congressmen implicated in the 
parapolitical scandal are soliciting legislative support for 
a bill to reclassify the conspiracy charges facing their 
clients ("concierto a delinquir") as a political crime, which 
would make them eligible for pardons and would preserve their 
political careers.  Gonzalez said Justice and Interior 
Minister Carlos Holguin had blocked effort to introduce an 
amendment to that effect in the legislative session that 
ended on June 20.  Gonzalez told polcouns Uribe will not 
support this approach and will not pardon congressmen 
involved in the parapolitical scandal.
