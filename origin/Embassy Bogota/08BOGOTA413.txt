SUBJECT: URIBE ANNOUNCES ENCIRCLEMENT PLAN FOR HOSTAGE 
RELEASE 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U)  President Uribe announced January 26 that he has 
ordered military and police to locate, and subsequently 
encircle, areas where the FARC holds hostages. GOC officials 
explained the move is aimed at putting "humanitarian 
pressure" on the FARC to release its hostages and is not a 
military rescue option. Critics say the cordon plan could 
lead to a military clash and endanger the hostages' lives. 
The French Government reiterated its opposition to a military 
rescue, while Catholic Church officials sought clarification 
of Uribe's comments.  Uribe's remarks followed his European 
trip, where he authorized the French, Spanish, and Swiss 
governments to work with the Catholic Church to promote 
humanitarian exchange talks with the FARC.  END SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------- 
URIBE ANNOUNCES CORDON PLAN 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U)  At a January 26 press conference, President Uribe 
said he ordered the military and police to pinpoint and 
surround locations where the FARC is holding hostages. Once 
located, he would seek the participation of the international 
community to press the FARC to release of hostages. Uribe 
said he first issued the order in June 2007 after the FARC 
killed eleven former Valle de Cauca legislators it held 
hostage.  Uribe's statement followed his European tour where 
he authorized France, Spain, and Switzerland to work with the 
Catholic Church to facilitate humanitarian talks FARC.  The 
FARC responded by accusing the GOC of "doubletalk" and 
"disrespect for human life," emphasizing that a military 
rescue operation would only end in bloodshed. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Minister of Defense Santos, currently in France, 
explained that GOC's intention is to support the Church plan 
and efforts by France, Spain, and Switzerland to achieve a 
humanitarian exchange.  Meanwhile, if information on the 
location of hostages surfaces, the encirclement plan can be 
used to engage the international community in place of a 
military operation.  Presidential advisor Jose Obdulio 
Gaviria said the cordon option is designed to put 
"humanitarian pressure" on the FARC, not to achieve a 
military rescue. In additional efforts to debilitate the 
FARC, the GOC offered USD 2.5 million rewards for each FARC 
leader arrested and announced a most-wanted poster campaign 
to target FARC members. 
 
----------------------------- 
CONCERNS ABOUT HOSTAGE SAFETY 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U)  The GOC's announcement sparked speculation about its 
commitment to a humanitarian accord and concern for the 
hostages' safety. Some hostage family members criticized the 
plan, saying it would endanger the hostages and reduce the 
possibility of a humanitarian accord.  Former hostage 
Consuelo Gonzalez de Perdomo, released by the FARC on January 
10, warned any attempt to surround or rescue hostages could 
put them in serious danger.  Claudia Rugeles, wife of former 
governor and FARC hostage Alan Jara, released two paragraphs 
from her husband's letter in January to prove the unviability 
of the plan.  Jara wrote that a "rescue has no hope of 
success.  If they bomb us, we'll die from above, if they come 
near us, they'll kill us on the ground.  Whether the bullets 
are 'good' or 'bad,' there is still only death." 
 
¶6.  (U)  The French government reiterated its position that 
no operation take place that could possibly endanger the 
hostages.  Monsignor Luis Augusto Castro, chairman of the 
Episcopal Conference, called for the GOC to explain its 
proposal further so the Church could evaluate its own 
facilitation efforts.  Congressman James McGovern  - who 
visited Colombia in mid January - also voiced concern on 
January 29 that using a cordon to force a humanitarian accord 
would be a "mistake."
