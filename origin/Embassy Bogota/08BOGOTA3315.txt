SUBJECT: SECOND PALM OIL SPILL RAISES CONCERNS 

REF: BOGOTA 2331 

¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Two palm oil spills in the last four months 
on Colombia's northern coast have begun to raise concerns 
about industry procedures and the sector's safeguards.  While 
the spills of the biodegradable material were limited in size 
and appear to have caused little environmental impact, palm 
oil producers worry they could damage the growing industry's 
reputation.  A Ministry of Environment study of the spills is 
underway and could result in proposed new regulations and 
additional operating costs for industry.  END SUMMARY. 

Isolated Incidents or Start of Pattern 
-------------------------------------- 

¶2. (SBU) On April 24 and again on August 26, palm oil shipper 
GranelesLiquidos del Caribe-Terlinca experienced spills of 
refined palm oil at its plant near the northern coast city 
and tourist destination of Santa Marta.  Terlinca serves as a 
logistics services company for palm oil exporters, but does 
not participate in palm oil production itself.  The company 
provides loading, storage and handling services for producers 
in Colombia's interior, exporting up to 15,000 tons of palm 
oil a month or approximately 57 percent of Colombia's palm 
oil exports in 2007 according to industry statistics. 

¶3. (SBU) The first spill, caused by a malfunctioning valve, 
totaled 90 tons and affected an estimated 120 square meters 
of coral reef, according to Francisco Arias Isaza of the 
Colombian Institute of Marine Regulations (INVEMAR).  A 
significant amount of the palm oil also washed up on the 
tourist beach of Taganga, turning the sand temporarily red 
and closing it to public use for several days.  The more 
recent spill, caused by a the collapse of a wall at the 
facility, totaled only 5 tons and did not reach either coral 
reefs or beaches, but raised concerns that Terlinca may not 
follow sufficiently strong safety procedures. 

Immediate Economic Impact Limited, but Image May Suffer 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 

¶4. (SBU) Andres Castro, Sustainable Development Director at 
the Colombian Federation of Palm Growers (Fedepalma), told us 
the temporary operational suspensions at Terlinca have not 
disrupted palm oil exports from Colombia.  (Note: Colombia is 
currently the world's fourth largest palm oil exporter 
according to Fedepalma statistics.  End Note.)  However, 
Castro said producers were now looking at shifting their 
product to alternative export terminals in Barranquilla and 
Cartagena.  He added that the more significant impact of the 
two spills could be to the industry's image as a whole. 

¶5. (SBU) Luis Alfredo Orozco, palm oil producer and president 
of a new USD 50 million palm oil-based biodiesel plant 
outside of Bogota, told us that, given previous controversies 
surrounding land issues and Colombia's palm industry, it is 
critical that the entire palm oil supply chain follow the 
strictest environmental and industrial safeguards. 
Anticipating increased regulation by the GOC, his company has 
put in place multiple-layer safety mechanisms at its palm oil 
refining and biodiesel production facility.  He estimates the 
addition measures have added as much as USD 5 million to the 
price of the plant. 

More Regulation on the Way?
--------------------------- 

¶6. (SBU) While both incidents were limited to one facility 
and the company insists all the escaped material was 
biodegradable, the Ministry of Environment has launched a 
review of the spills and a group of Santa Marta citizens have 
filed a civil suit against Terlinca.  Either process could 
lead to new regulations or court-ordered safeguards for the 
industry as a whole.  The Ministry estimates the value of the 
two spills at approximately USD 1.6 million in commercial 
losses and clean-up costs, but depending its final findings 
the cost of any new regulations to industry could reach 
significantly higher.
