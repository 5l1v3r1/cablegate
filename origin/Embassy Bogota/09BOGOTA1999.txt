E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV PREL PTER PJUS PHUM CO
SUBJECT: COLOMBIAN SENATORS INVESTIGATED IN 
"FARC-POLITICAL" SCANDAL 

SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (U) In the most recent development in the "FARC-political" 
scandal, Colombian Inspector General Alejandro Ordonez
announced on June 10 the opening of preliminary 
investigations against Colombian senators Piedad Cordoba, 
Wilson Borja and Gloria Ines Ramirez.  Ordonez said the 
investigations are based on information obtained from 
deceased FARC Secretariat member Raul Reyes' laptops, and 
noted that more investigations could follow.  The Colombian 
police earlier presented a report to the Supreme Court 
implicating the three senators, which could potentially lead 
to criminal charges.  The opposition senators have denied the 
charges and allege the investigations are politically 
motivated.  The Supreme Court has criminal jurisdiction over 
sitting legislators.  End Summary. 

PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS OPENED 
--------------------------------- 
¶2. (U) On June 10, Colombian Inspector General (Procurador) 
Alejandro Ordonez announced the opening of preliminary 
investigations of three Colombian opposition senators for 
alleged links to the FARC.  The cases have been referred to 
as the "FARC-political" scandal.  The three under 
investigation are Liberal Party senator Piedad Cordoba and 
Democratic Polo Party senators Wilson Borja and Gloria Ines 
Ramirez.  "Semana" magazine reported on June 11 that 
Ordonez's office had also opened preliminary investigations 
against Polo senator Jorge Enrique Robledo and Bogota 
city-councilman and Communist Party member Jaime Caicedo. 


¶3. (U) Ordonez said the cases are based on information 
obtained from deceased FARC Secretariat member Raul Reyes' 
laptops which were recovered by the GOC in the March 2008 
raid on Reyes' camp.  He noted that he could potentially 
suspend the lawmakers if his office concludes that they went 
too far in their contacts with the FARC.  Ordonez added that 
other individuals, including more congressman, may be subject 
to investigation. 

¶4. (U) "El Tiempo" reported on June 14 that the Colombian 
police and the Prosecutor General's Office (Fiscalia) 
delivered an extensive report to the Supreme Court on April 
21 alleging that these individuals had collaborated with the 
FARC.  If the Supreme Court finds that there is enough proof 
to substantiate these charges, a criminal investigation could 
be opened for rebellion.  "Semana" magazine reported that the 
Supreme Court initially reviewed evidence implicating a total 
of 10 members of congress, but the Court concluded that there 
was only enough evidence to proceed against Cordoba, Borja
and Ramirez.  The Court is expected to make a decision on 
these cases in the coming weeks. 

THE CHARGES 
----------- 
¶5. (U) "El Tiempo" also reported that the Fiscalia suspects 
that Cordoba is the "Teodora Bolivar" referred to in several 
e-mails sent to Raul Reyes relaying strategic GOC information 
and plans.  Police investigators noted the similarity of 
timing and acts between alias "Teodora" and Cordoba.  Wilson 
Borja is accused of receiving funds from the FARC to attend 
international events, and Ramirez is accused of meeting with 
the FARC and with Fensuagro members sympathetic to the FARC. 

DENIALS 
------- 
¶6. (U) Cordoba denied that she was "Teodora," noting that she 
had always acted legally in her role as a humanitarian 
mediator, and affirming that she would cooperate fully with 
any investigation.  She later called the case a "farce" and 
suggested that she may have been targeted because she did not 
support the nomination of Ordonez.  Cordoba also noted that 
her political positions for peace and reconciliation "annoy 
some sectors."  Ramirez also denied the charges, arguing that 
she could not be tried simply for being a leftist.  She said 
she opposes the armed struggle and conceded that she has 
participated in humanitarian talks. 

¶7. (U) Wilson Borja denied having corresponded with Raul 

Reyes or any other members of the FARC, and said that he was 
being politically persecuted.  In a heated congressional 
debate with the ex-Prosecutor General (Fiscal) Mario Iguaran, 
Borja insinuated that the Fiscalia was not impartial. 
Iguaran responded that "I hope that you don't say the court 
is also not impartial when they order your arrest." 

URIBE CRITICAL OF JUDICIAL "IMPUNITY" 
------------------------------------- 
¶8. (U) President Uribe has repeatedly criticized what he 
calls the Court's slow approach to the "FARC-political" 
cases, contrasting them with the more than 60 convictions in 
the "para-political" scandal.  Still, "Cambio" magazine on 
June 18 observed that whereas in the para-political scandal 
there were numerous supporting  confessions, testimony and 
documentary proof, in the case of the "FARC-political" 
scandal the proof hinges almost entirely on e-mail exchanges.
