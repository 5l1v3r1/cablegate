SUMMARY 

------- 



¶1. (U) Diego Molano was named the new head of the President's 
Agency for Social Action and International Cooperation (Accion
Social).  The GOC has officially changed the name of "Fusion 
Centers" to "Regional Coordination Centers."  Assistant Secretary 
of Defense Paul Stockton visited the Plan for the Integral 
Consolidation of the Macarena (PCIM) zone in Meta department.  The 
Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI) working group is 

conducting an integrated planning process for the Central Band 
priority zone.  Embassy formed a CSDI Steering Committee to improve 
decision-making and coordination.  CSDI programs in Tumaco, Narino
Department, are increasing Afro-Colombian representation in the 
Colombian National Police (CNP) and enhancing capacity.  ONDCP 
Director Gil Kerlikowske visited CSDI programs in Tumaco.  GOC 
officials identify disappointing progress along border with 
Venezuela.  End Summary. 



Diego Molano Named Head of Accion Social 

---------------------------------------- 



¶2.  (U) Diego Molano was sworn in as the Director General of Accion
Social on September 17 and filled what had been a political
leadership vacuum on the civilian side of the GOC's National 
Consolidation Plan (PNC).  His challenge will be to stimulate 
lackluster participation from key GOC civilian ministries and the 
justice sector while securing a concrete commitment of budget 
allocations to be applied to PNC activities.  Molano was the Deputy 
Chief of Party for USAID's Additional Investment for Sustainable 
Alternative Development (MIDAS) program since April 2008 and also 
managed USAID's Ethnic Productive Territories (TEP) program. 
Before joining USAID, he served as Director of Presidential 
Programs at Accion Social from 2005 to 2008 and Coordinator for 
Plan Colombia from 2003 to 2005.  Molano studied in the United 
States, receiving a master's degree in international affairs from 
Columbia University.  Embassy is encouraging Molano to visit 
Washington at the earliest opportunity to reinforce his civilian 
leadership role in PNC. 



GOC Officially Abandons "Fusion Center" Name 

-------------------------------------------- 



¶3. (U) CCAI officials met with CSDI officers September 9 and told 
us that the GOC had officially changed the name of "Fusion Centers" 
to "Regional Coordination Centers" (RCCs) in order to avoid the 
former name's military connotation and possible association with 
intelligenceQations. 



Assistant Secretary of Defense Stockton 

Visits Consolidation Efforts in La Macarena 

------------------------------------------- 



¶4.  (SBU) Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Stockton visited the 
PCIM zone in Meta department on September 24 with Vice Minister of 
Defense Sergio Jaramillo.  ASD Stockton visited a Joint Task Force 
(JTF) Omega base in La Macarena, town hall meetings in Pinalito and 
Vista Hermosa, and the Vista Hermosa RCC.  At the JTF base, the 
Omega commander told ASD Stockton that the USG can best support 
consolidation by continuing its security assistance in the same 
form (citing intelligence, airlift and technical assistance) since 
the zone is still in transition.  Jaramillo added that the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) have been unable to 
threaten community leaders and consolidation programs in the PCIM 
because they have been cut off from their militia in the towns and 
are under operational pressure from the JTF. 



¶5. (U) In Pinalito, a hamlet of 1,500 beginning the consolidation 
process, community members were developing an accord between the 
central government and the community outlining each side's 
responsibility in transitioning the community from coca to the 
legal economy.  Residents acknowledged "we made a big mistake" in 
growing coca but insisted they had no alternative because the state 
was not present.  They described the transition as traumatic and 
requested tertiary roads, schools, agricultural equipment and food 
assistance.  Despite the challenges, citizens expressed gratitude 
for a safe community and their desire to reach legitimate 
self-sufficiency.  They thanked the USG for its assistance and 
implored the delegation (both USG and GOC) not to abandon them. 



Planning Process for Central Band 

Highlights CSDI Coordination 

--------------------------------- 



¶6. (U) CSDI is developing a plan for coordinated assistance to the 
Central Band CSDI priority zone -- La Macarena in Meta west through 
southern Tolima and Valle del Cauca to Buenaventura on the Pacific 
coast.  As a first step, the GOC is identifying key population 
centers where targeted assistance would deliver the most 
significant strategic gains and consolidation impact.  These will 
be prioritized by the CSDI working group and interagency teams will 
travel to key locations to jointly assess current conditions and 
requirements.  The results of the design process will be used to 
phase and coordinate future assistance from various USG entities. 



CSDI Forms Steering Committee 

----------------------------- 



¶7. (U) The CSDI working group formed a steering committee to 
provide strategic guidance and direction for CSDI activities.  The 
three primary members are the Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) 
Director, USAID Mission Director and Military Group Commander with 
the Political Counselor acting as policy advisor. 



Police Scholarship Program Boosts 

Afro-Colombian Representation 

--------------------------------- 



¶8. (U) In September a NAS police scholarship program (see reftel) 
produced 56 Afro-Colombian police recruit candidates from Tumaco, 
along with another 50 from other Pacific coast towns, providing a 
significant boost in Afro-Colombian police recruits from previous 
years. (Note:  There were less than five police recruits from 
Tumaco in 2008.  End note.)  The program is designed to increase 
representation from and police links to underrepresented 
populations.  The new recruits are scheduled to enter CNP academies 
in April 2010. 



Enhancing Police Capacity in Tumaco

----------------------------------- 



¶9.  (U) The CNP Antinarcotics Police (DIRAN), with the support of 
the NAS Jungla program, augmented DIRAN's long-term presence in 
Tumaco.  During September, DIRAN added 25 Junglas (CNP airmobile 
commandos) and 20 intelligence and judicial officials, effectively 
doubling DIRAN's presence there.  The Junglas destroyed three HCL 
cocaine labs and 15 coca base labs in the Tumaco operating area in 
September.



¶10. (U) The NAS Carabineros program delivered six motorcycles and 
computer equipment to the Tumaco municipal police in September.  In 
addition, $10,000 of communication equipment was procured and 
scheduled for delivery in October.  NAS Maritime supplied Coast 
Guard units with eye protection equipment and Global Positioning 
Systems to enhance operational capabilities.  The Tumaco Coast 
Guard station will also receive $6,000 in communications equipment 
for interceptors. 



ONDCP Director Visits Tumaco Priority Zone 

------------------------------------------ 



¶11. (U) ONDCP Director R. Gil Kerlikowske visited Colombia from 
September 27-30.  Director Kerlikowske met with President Uribe, 
the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Interior and Justice, and 
the Director General of the National Police.  He emphasized that 
the Obama Administration's focus on prevention and treatment will 
not decrease USG support to counternarcotics efforts in Colombia. 
The Director also traveled to Tumaco in the CSDI Southern priority 
zone and observed Embassy-supported alternative development and 
police security assistance programs and a housing project for 
internally displaced persons (septel). 



GOC Consolidation Efforts Along Venezuelan Border Lagging 

--------------------------------------------- ------------ 



¶12. (SBU) Bogota-based GOC officials responsible for the PNC met 
with local civilian coordinators and military and police commanders 
at Colombian Army Second Division Headquarters in Cucuta, Norte de 
Santander Department, on September 23 to discuss consolidation 
progress in the Arauca department and the Catatumbo region of Norte 
de Santander department - both areas along the border with 
Venezuela.  The Bogota officials told local coordinators and 
commanders that these two areas are not progressing against the 
benchmarks set out for them and that the GOC is considering 
elevating the importance of Arauca and Catatumbo -- currently 
"complementary" and "secondary" zones respectively -- due to 
deteriorating security indicators.  Representatives from the 
departmental governments pleaded for more social investment to 
accompany substantial security advances saying that there is a 
great risk of dashing some communities' post-eradication 
expectations.  Various officials noted that the judicial sector was 
critical yet lagging.
