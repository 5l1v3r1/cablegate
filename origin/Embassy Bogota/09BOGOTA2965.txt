(SBU) Deputy Political Counselor delivered the generic points 
in paragraph 11 of reftel to MFA Acting Director for 
Multilateral Political Affairs Margarita Orozco and Director 
for U.S. and Canadian Affairs Adriana Maldonado on August 15. 
 They replied that Colombia shares U.S. concerns and strongly 
supports International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) efforts to 
monitor Iran's nuclear program compliance.  Orozco said that 
when the GOC was a member of the IAEA Governing Council, it 
supported sending Iran's non-compliance to the UN Security 
Council.  She also noted that Colombia prefers a diplomatic 
solution.
