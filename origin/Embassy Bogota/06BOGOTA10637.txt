CORRESPONDENT FOR TERRORISM 
 
 
¶1. (U) On November 19, immigration authorities from the 
Department of Administrative Security (DAS) detained Freddy 
Munoz Altamiranda on suspicion of terrorism and rebellion, as 
he attempted to enter the country through El Dorado Airport. 
Munoz, a Colombian citizen, is an international correspondent 
for Venezuelan television station Telesur.   The Prosecutor 
General's Office in Barranquilla is charging Munoz with 
having planted and activated explosives in an electric 
substation, a department store, and a supermarket.  In 
addition, the Prosecutor General's Office alleges Munoz 
manufactured an explosive that accidentally killed a 
co-conspirator, alias Moises.  The incidents took place in or 
around Cartagena in 2002 and 2003. 
 
¶2. (SBU) A report by the Prosecutor General's Office states 
Freddy Munoz (alias Jorge Eliecer) allegedly belonged to the 
37th Front of the FARC.  The Prosecutor General's Office 
opened the investigation into Munoz in August 2006, derived 
from a Colombian Navy intelligence report.  The arrest 
warrant, issued November 10, is based in part on witness 
testimony.  The Director of the Prosecutor General's Office 
in Barranquilla said he expected Munoz to arrive in that city 
for arraignment on November 20. 
 
¶3. (U) The Colombian Foundation for Freedom of Press quoted 
Munoz from his place of reclusion, stating, "The free press 
is once more threatened by those who use coercion, fear, lies 
to force its submission."
