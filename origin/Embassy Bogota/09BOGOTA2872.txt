SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  A group calling itself "No More Chavez" launched protests 
across Colombia and around the world on September 4 against 
the Government of Venezuela.  Protesters demanded that 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez stay out of Colombia, 
grouped him with the terrorist Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC), said "Latin America has had enough," and 
urged Venezuelans to "wake up" and halt his "dictatorship." 
The largest marches in Colombia were in Bogota, where Poloff 
saw a couple thousand participants, and in Cali, where a 
national news station estimated 5,000 participants.  Media 
outlets reported smaller demonstrations in other cities.  The 
Venezuelan Ambassador spoke out against the protests in the 
local media.  End Summary. 
 
CHAVEZ INSULTS SPARK ORGANIZERS 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Colombians across the country gathered to march against 
the Government of Venezuela on September 4.  The name of the 
organization behind the marches and the principal chant was 
"No More Chavez!"  The lead promoter, Alejandro Gutierrez, 
claimed in the media that No More Chavez organized protests 
in 100 cities worldwide, including 30 in Colombia and 18 in 
the United States.  The idea for the protests began when four 
youth groups were offended when President Hugo Chavez called 
Colombians "traitors" and invited them to join his Bolivarian 
revolution in his weekly television show "Hello President." 
The organizers used Facebook (the page has nearly 200,000 
fans), Twitter, YouTube, and other websites, and claim that 
over one million people worldwide joined the protest network. 
 Juan David Lacouture created the Facebook page, which refers 
to Chavez as a "totalitarian communist, militarist and 
demagogue who has failed to deliver on his promises, violated 
fundamental rights, meddled in the affairs of other Latin 
American countries, threatened Venezuela's economy and 
democracy, illegally silenced opponents, and destabilized 
global oil prices."  Rodrigo Obregon, director of the 
"Wounded Colombia" Foundation, also helped organize the 
rallies. 
 
BOGOTA DEMANDS CHAVEZ STAY OUT OF COLOMBIA 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  The anti-Chavez rally in Bogota was peaceful and somewhat 
dispersed, as there were three meeting points in the city. 
Only about 500 participants had joined at the noon start 
time, but Poloff watched the number swell to a couple 
thousand three hours later.  The most common chant and 
(white) T-shirt slogan was "No More Chavez!"  The protesters 
also called Chavez a "narcoterrorist," "fascist," 
"socialist," "dictator," and "demented."  Many of the banners 
grouped Chavez with the FARC, or demanded that Chavez stay 
out of Colombia (e.g., "No More Deaths - No More FARC - No 
More Chavez," "Chavez Go Home," "Shut Up Chavez," and "Chavez 
Demobilize").  One large banner read, "To Hell with the 
Sukhois," referring to Venezuelan military aircraft that 
Chavez has threatened to use against Colombia.  The rallyists 
also urged Venezuelans to "wake up" and said "Latin America 
Has Had Enough" of Chavez.  Some individuals carried 
pro-Uribe signs and one held a large American flag in the 
central rally location.  Poloff also saw a group of Hondurans 
participating and waving Honduran flags.  A more 
extremist-looking group of about 40 protesters wearing black 
and representing a group called the Third Force (Tercera 
Fuerza) linked Chavez to the Colombian far-leftist Polo Party. 
 
¶4.  Although youth predominated, there were protesters of all 
ages and of several nationalities.  In addition to the formal 
protesters, there were hundreds of supportive onlookers along 
the rally route and many passing vehicles honked their 
approval.  Poloff did not observe any pro-Chavez individuals 
or hear any remarks criticizing the rally.  The press 
described one group of anti-Uribe demonstrators that briefly 
engaged the anti-Chavez rallyists without incident.  A 
sizeable number of police patrolled the rally's periphery. 
 
PROTESTS IN OTHER COLOMBIAN CITIES 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Media reports indicate that the protests in the rest of 
Colombia have also been peaceful.  The largest march thus far 
has been in Cali, where Caracol TV reported that more than 
5,000 protesters marched to the Central Administrative Plaza. 
 The protest dispersed shortly thereafter as they lacked 
permission from the city government to enter the plaza. 
Protests in Medellin, Barranquilla (about 500 individuals), 
Cucuta, and other cities were reportedly much smaller, with 
only "dozens" in some locations. 
 
VENEZUELAN AMBASSADOR BLAMES AMERICAN EMPIRE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Venezuela's Ambassador to Colombia, Gustavo Marquez, told 
a local radio station on September 4 that the marches 
represent a "campaign of hate," are an attempt to "divert 
attention from core issues," and are an act of disrespect to 
"polarize opinion."  He went on to claim that the marches 
served the "American Empire that seeks to divide us."  Chavez 
had earlier called the marches "stupid."
