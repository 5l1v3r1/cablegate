FROM MALDIVES, BUT NOT SRI LANKA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 123081 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) Maldivian Foreign Minister Shaheed assured 
Ambassador that Maldives could probably shift "to a more 
reasonable stance" on the anti-Israel resolutions.  He 
indicated, however, that MFA would have to look at each 
resolution on a case-by-case basis.  He also reported that he 
had instructed the Maldivian Ambassador in New York to break 
ranks with the "conservative majority" in the Organization of 
Islamic Countries and support a resolution banning 
extrajudicial killings. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Sri Lankan MFA Director General for UN and 
Multilateral Affairs Wijewardhana reported that Sri Lanka 
would continue to support the resolutions on Palestine as it 
has "for decades".  Wijewardhana confirmed that Sri Lanka 
abstained on the recent UNGA Third Committee resolution on 
DPRK (calling Sri Lanka's "yes" vote last year "unusual.") 
She also said that Sri Lanka had voted against the Iran and 
Burma resolutions.
