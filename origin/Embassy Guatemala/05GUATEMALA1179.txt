SUBJECT: GUATEMALA ON IRAQ TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT 
 
REF: STATE 79107 
 
¶1. (SBU) Following up on reftel demarche, the Ambassador 
spoke with Guatemalan Acting FM Marta Altolguirre to urge the 
GOG to welcome the formation of the Iraq Transitional 
Government and convey support for Iraq's reconstruction and 
political transition. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Altolaguirre said she was impressed by Iraq's 
successful elections, peaceful transition and the inclusion 
of Sunnis in the government.  She said that, in the absence 
of diplomatic relations with Iraq, the MFA considered it 
would be awkward to issue unilaterally a statement of support 
for the ITG.  Guatemala would therefore look for an 
appropriate (i.e., multilateral) venue to convey its support. 
 She said she would take up with FM Briz the issue of 
establishing relations with Iraq.
