SUBJECT: MANAGING ALLIANCE ISSUES: A/S CAMPBELL'S 
DISCUSSION WITH STATE MINISTER FOR OKINAWA MAEHARA 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission James P. Zumwalt; Reasons 1.4 (B 
) and (D) 
 
¶1.  (S) Summary: EAP A/S Kurt Campbell urged Minister of 
Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT) and State 
Minister for Okinawa Seiji Maehara to inform Prime Minister 
Hatoyama and Foreign Minister Okada that the Democratic Party 
of Japan (DPJ) Government's attempts to review every aspect 
of U.S.-Japan Alliance issues at once would undermine the 
Alliance and that the Japanese government should focus rather 
on one or two issues on which both governments could 
coordinate their approaches.  He stressed that U.S. patience 
would wear thin if the DPJ Government continued to make 
multiple suggestions to review and adjust extant Alliance 
arrangements and underscored the need for a positive visit to 
Japan by the President as an important part of reaffirming 
the Alliance.  Maehara side-stepped on Alliance issues, 
deferring to Foreign Minister Okada on substantive Japanese 
government feedback.  He focused instead on local sentiments 
in Okinawa on realignment issues, stressing the need to 
counterbalance deterrence capabilities in Okinawa with the 
goal of reduced burdens on the local communities.  He pointed 
to Okinawan local politics as a potential source of 
complications as the January election for Nago City Mayor 
portended a show-down between the incumbent Mayor, a 
proponent of Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF) plans, and an 
opponent who opposed FRF.  U.S. plans to bring MV-22 aircraft 
to Camp Schwab would also influence the local communities' 
receptivity to FRF plans. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), 
which remained potent in Okinawa, continued to oppose 
off-shore construction plans for the FRF's V-shaped runways. 
A/S Campbell and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
East Asia Michael Schiffer highlighted the importance of 
Japan's Indian Ocean refueling mission in support of 
Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), stressing that Japan should 
regard support for Afghanistan and Pakistan from a 
multilateral standpoint, rather than from an Alliance 
context.  End Summary. 
 
Managing Relations 
------------------ 
 
¶2.  (C) The U.S. Government recognized that the Democratic 
Party of Japan (DPJ) Government wished to examine adjustments 
in relations, particularly regarding the U.S.-Japan Alliance, 
visiting EAP A/S Kurt Campbell told Seiji Maehara, Minister 
of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT) and 
State Minister for Okinawa in an October 11 discussion.  A/S 
Campbell noted, however, that attempts to ""put every issue on 
the table at once"" would undermine the Alliance and cast 
doubt on the ability of both sides to fulfill security 
commitments.  He asked Maehara to inform Prime Minister 
Hatoyama and Foreign Minister Okada to focus on one or two 
issues in the immediate term that both governments could 
address in a choreographed manner.  A/S Campbell observed 
that the U.S. Government, to date, had not publicly responded 
with respect to multiple Japanese government suggestions for 
review and adjustment of Alliance arrangements, but should 
the current trend continue, U.S. patience would wear thin and 
pressure would build to criticize DPJ Government proposals. 
""We need a positive visit by President Obama as part of the 
process of reaffirming the relationship,"" A/S Campbell added. 
 
Realignment Read-out 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  (S) Maehara said he welcomed A/S Campbell's views and 
would try his best to digest the information.  He deferred, 
however, to Foreign Minster Okada as having the lead on 
Alliance-related issues.  He cited the challenges faced by 
the Okinawa Prefecture, which had the lowest average income 
and highest unemployment rate among Japan's prefectures. 
Okinawa was also the only prefecture to have experienced a 
ground battle in World War II, a campaign that caused great 
loss of life.  Maehara continued that Okinawans would feel 
 
indignant if they believed that they were being bought off on 
base issues.  By the same token, he believed it was telling 
that he was planning to reduce the MLIT budget by 
one-seventh, but no budgetary cuts were scheduled for 
Okinawa.  The goal of reducing burdens on Okinawa residents 
therefore had to counterbalance the U.S. objective of 
maintaining deterrence against China and North Korea with the 
U.S. military presence in the prefecture, Maehara asserted. 
 
¶4.  (S) A/S Campbell noted that support for realignment and 
plans for the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF) among 
Okinawa's mayors was unprecedented, and he asked for 
Maehara's read on the prefecture's local political situation. 
 Maehara pointed out that the Nago City election in January 
would be key regarding prospects for successful 
implementation of realignment initiatives.  Incumbent Mayor 
Yoshikazu Shimabukuro, who favored FRF plans, was running 
against FRF opponent Susumu Inamine, who enjoyed the support 
of the wife of former Mayor Tateo Kishimoto.  Shimabukuro's 
defeat, explained Maehara, would imply the loss of local 
political support for FRF.  He added that U.S. plans to 
introduce MV-22 (""Osprey"") aircraft into Camp Schwab would 
also impact the acceptability of FRF plans among local 
residents, due to noise concerns and the fact that the 
current environmental impact survey (EIS) did not include 
consideration of the deployment of MV-22 aircraft. (Note: 
Separately, DG Takamizawa told A/S Campbell that the EIS 
process did not require the inclusion of future aircraft. 
End Note.) Maehara continued that the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), which remained strong in Okinawa, continued to oppose 
off-shore construction plans for the FRF's V-shaped runways. 
The fact that Prime Minister Hatoyama's campaign pledge to 
favor out-of-Okinawa options for the FRF merited special 
editions of all local Okinawan newspapers should show the 
U.S. Government the depth of local feelings about 
realignment, Maehara observed.  He concluded by asking for 
more information on FRF plans, particularly proposals on 
MV-22 aircraft and their airfield requirements. 
 
¶5.  (C) A/S Campbell committed to provide Maehara and senior 
DPJ Government leaders any information they might require in 
the course of their realignment review.  Such briefings 
should be conducted privately, he added.  A/S Campbell also 
noted that he wished to begin a dialogue on Okinawa that 
reached beyond base issues, to include greater opportunities 
for bilateral business and trade as well as educational 
exchanges. 
 
Indian Ocean Refueling 
---------------------- 
 
¶6.  (S) A/S Campbell described Japan's Indian Ocean refueling 
mission in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) as a 
symbol of Japan's engagement on a critical multilateral 
issue.  He pointed out that the refueling operation had 
benefited U.S. allies more than the United States itself, 
though the U.S. Navy had highly valued the assistance. 
During and following the Japanese election, the U.S. 
Government had listened respectfully to DPJ calls to end 
refueling.  While Defense Minister Kitazawa had been more 
categorical in his insistence on ending the mission, Foreign 
Minister Okada had appeared more flexible and had visited 
Afghanistan in recent days to look at other options for 
assistance, remarked A/S Campbell.  He asserted that the 
announcement of a Japanese commitment to a mission supporting 
Afghanistan and Pakistan during President Obama's upcoming 
visit would give bilateral relations a ""boost of confidence."" 
 Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (DASD) for East Asia 
Michael Schiffer, who also took part in the discussion, added 
that Japan should not see Af/Pak contributions solely in the 
context of the Alliance, but rather in a multilateral 
context.  He said Japan's contributions should be 
commensurate with its role in the world. 
 
China 
 
----- 
 
¶7.  (S) A/S Campbell noted Japanese public perceptions that 
U.S. foreign policy seemed to focus more on China, Iraq, and 
Afghanistan than Japan.  U.S. and Japanese officials, 
however, had met nearly every week since the Japanese Lower 
House elections and had thus established a pattern for close 
interaction.  A/S Campbell noted that the U.S. Government 
hoped to avoid any perception of a gap between the United 
States and Japan, particularly vis-a-vis China.  The United 
States and Japan needed to work with China, but the reality 
was that both governments were in a relentless competition 
with the PRC.  A strong U.S.-Japan relationship would give 
both sides the confidence and flexibility needed to address 
such development. 
 
¶8.  (U) A/S Campbell has cleared this message.
