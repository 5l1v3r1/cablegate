SUBJECT: TERRORISM FINANCE--GOJ RESPONSE TO DESIGNATION OF 
WAAD PROJECT 
 
REF: STATE 1800 
 
(SBU) On January 14, Embassy Tokyo delivered reftel points on 
U.S. designation of the Waad Project  to MOFA International 
Counterterrorism Cooperation Division Deputy Director Miyako 
Ishimura.  Embassy Tokyo noted that the designation of the 
Waad Project as a terrorist support organization under 
Executive Order 13224 prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in 
any transactions with the Lebanon-based, Hizballah-run 
construction company.  Noting the designation is limited to 
U.S. persons, we stressed the importance of other countries, 
including Japan, taking similar steps to freeze Waad's 
assets.  Ishimura stated that Japan, while not sanctioning 
Hizballah, shares U.S. concerns and appreciated our efforts 
to tell her government of the designation.  She added that 
Japan would review the information provided and inform us of 
any actions taken against the company.
