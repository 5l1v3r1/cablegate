SUBJECT: JAPAN TO EXTEND SELF DEFENSE FORCE PARTICIPATION 
IN GOLAN HEIGHTS OBSERVER FORCE 
 
¶1. (U) Japan decided July 31 to extend Japan Self Defense 
Force (JSDF) participation in the U.N. Disengagement Observer 
Force in the Golan Heights (UNDOF) for an additional six 
months ending March 31, 2008, according to press reports 
confirmed by MOFA contacts.  The decision was made in 
response to a July 20 UNSC decision to extend the mandate of 
UNDOF for another six months. 
 
¶2. (U) Japan has been providing rear area support to UNDOF by 
sending Ground Self Defense Force (GSDF) units and other 
personnel to take part in transport operations and road 
repair work since February 1996.  In addition, the Air Self 
Defense Force (ASDF) has been supporting the GSDF with 
occasional airlifts of food and other supplies with its C-130 
transports, although the ASDF is not a member of UNDOF. 
 
¶3. (U) The decision to extend JSDF participation was based on 
the understanding that Japan, as a member of the 
international community, should continue making contributions 
toward the achievement of peace in the Middle East, according 
to MOFA Foreign Policy Bureau's Peacekeeping Operations 
Office.
