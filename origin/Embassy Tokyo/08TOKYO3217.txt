SUBJECT: JAPAN'S VIEWS ON NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 122262 
 
Classified By: Ambassador J. Thomas Schieffer.  Reasons 1.4 (B) (D) 
 
¶1. (C) On November 21, Embassy Tokyo political officer 
delivered reftel demarche regarding the Nicaraguan municipal 
elections to MOFA Mexico, Central America and Caribbean 
Division Principal Deputy Director Noritsugu Takahashi. 
Takahasi, who said Japanese officials had already noted 
remarks made by a United States government spokesperson, 
described the position as "clear and straight-forward." 
Tokyo agrees with the United States view "with regard to 
basics and tone-setting," however the "main point is how to 
do it - how to make it happen," he observed. 
 
¶2. (C) Japan agrees with the concepts laid out in the 
Declaracion de la Mesa de Cooperantes, Takahashi continued. 
Two main principles of Tokyo's approach to Nicaragua are: a) 
non-interference in Nicaragua's internal politics, and b) 
promoting Nicaraguan democracy.  Japanese officials would 
find it difficult to violate those principles and at the same 
time are looking to ways to "balance" the two. 
 
¶3. (C) According to Takahashi, "Japan's behavior would follow 
the majority view established by the major donors."  The 
Japanese government understands the United States plans to 
work with involved organizations to craft an international 
"voice" on Nicaragua.  He concluded Japan would more likely 
be willing to follow the United States lead.
