SUBJECT: JAPAN UNCERTAIN ON ATTENDANCE AT CENTCOM IRAQ 
CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 155973 
 
¶1.  This is an ACTION REQUEST.  See paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. Per reftel, DCM called on Japan's Ambassador for Iraq 
Reconstruction Gotaro Ogawa September 26 to present 
Ambassador Satterfield's invitation for Japan to send a 
civilian representative to the October 3-5 CENTCOM Conference 
on Iraq in Warsaw.  Ogawa was aware of the conference but 
said Japan had not decided whether to send anyone.  He 
wondered whether it would be permissible for Japan to be 
represented by someone from its Embassy in Poland.  DCM 
replied that this was Japan's decision, but that the 
conference organizers are hoping to attract representatives 
who are well-versed in what is taking place in Iraq.  Ogawa 
replied that he would give further consideration to Japan's 
attendance at the conference and asked for information on who 
else will be attending. He also wondered whether the CENTCOM 
conference was coordinated in any way with the Compact With 
Iraq drafting meeting that is scheduled to begin in Baghdad 
on October 6. 
 
¶3. ACTION REQUEST:  Embassy Tokyo requests information from 
conference organizers concerning confirmed civilian attendees 
that we can share with Ambassador Ogawa.
