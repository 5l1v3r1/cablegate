REF: STATE 74598 
 
(SBU) In response to reftel demarche, which delivered May 10, 
MOFA UN Policy Division Deputy Director Hirotaka Ishikawa 
told Poloff on May 11 that the resolution on the 
Syria-Lebanon issue "would contribute to the stability of the 
situation."  Ishikawa stopped short of officially committing 
the Japanese government's support, however, saying that his 
government has not been fully briefed on the details of the 
draft.
