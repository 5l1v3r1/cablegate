Visa 
---- 
 
¶5.  (U) Holders of U.S. diplomatic or official passports must 
have a Japanese visa to enter Japan.  Travelers on a U.S. 
tourist (blue cover) passport may enter Japan as a tourist 
without a Japanese visa for up to 90 days.  As of November 
20, 2007, all foreign nationals entering Japan, with the 
exemption of certain categories, are required to provide 
fingerprints and a facial photograph at the port of entry. 
This requirement does not replace any existing visa or 
passport requirements.  Official U.S. travelers will have to 
submit to the photograph and fingerprinting requirement 
unless they travel with a valid diplomatic or official visa 
or a Note Verbale.  The nature of the passport onto which the 
visa is pasted is not relevant, i.e. a tourist passport 
holder with a diplomatic or official visa will not have to 
submit to the biometrics collection process.  SOFA personnel 
are exempt under SOFA Article 9 (2) from the new biometrics 
entry requirements.

Embassy Laptop Policy 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Official visitors are reminded that personally owned 
or non-controlled USG-issued electronic equipment (including 
all PDAs, cell phones, pagers, radios, records) may not enter 
the controlled access areas.  Additionally, all classified 
and sensitive materials must be secured at the embassy visit 
control office upon arrival in country. 
 
----------------- 
Threat Assessment 
----------------- 
 
¶7.  (U) U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain at a 
heightened state of alert.  As the U.S. Government has 
reported in public announcements over the last several 
months, U.S. citizens and interests abroad may be at 
increased risk of terrorist actions from extremist groups, 
which may target civilians and include suicide operations. 
The Department maintains information about potential threats 
to Americans overseas which is available to travelers on the 
internet at the Bureau of Consular Affairs home page: 
http://www.travel.state.gov.  The Embassy takes all threats 
seriously.  U.S. Embassy Tokyo can be contacted 24 hours a 
day at 03-3224-5000 (locally) or 81-3-3224-5000 
(internationally). 
 
¶8.  (U) The general threat from crime in Tokyo and throughout 
Japan is low.  Crime is at levels well below the U.S. 
national average.  Violent crime is rare, but does exist. 
The Japanese National Police report continued problems with 
pick-pocketing of foreigners in crowded shopping areas of 
Tokyo.  Although street crime is low, common sense security 
measures are advised for all American citizens traveling in 
Japan. 
 
¶9.  (U) Also be advised that under no circumstances may 
weapons be brought into Japan.  Carrying a pocketknife 
(including Swiss Army-style knife, craft or hunting knife, 
box cutter, etc.) in public is forbidden.  Under Japanese 
law, carrying any such item in public, with a size exceeding 
8 cm in length, 1.5 cm in width or 2 mm in thickness, can 
subject the person to arrest or detention.
