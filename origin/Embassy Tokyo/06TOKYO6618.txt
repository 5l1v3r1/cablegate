Japan will support a United Nations Security Council 
Resolution to extend the mandate of Multinational Force - 
Iraq for an additional year, according to Yuko Noda, of 
MOFA's United Nations Policy Division, and Takahiro Sato, of 
MOFA's National Security Policy Division.  Embassy Tokyo 
Political Officer, joined by British counterpart, called on 
Noda and Sato November 20 to deliver reftel A talking points, 
draft resolution, and letter from Iraqi Prime Minister 
al-Maliki.  Political Officer also provided a copy of the 
Secretary's letter to the UNSC president, per reftel B.  Noda 
 
SIPDIS 
and Sato noted that Japan hopes the resolution will be passed 
as soon as possible, hopefully no later than November 24 so 
that Tokyo can begin to take steps to renew its Basic Plan 
under which Japanese Self Defense elements operate in Iraq. 
The current plan will expire December 14.  When asked whether 
Japan will cosponsor the resolution, Noda replied that this 
was still a question under consideration.
