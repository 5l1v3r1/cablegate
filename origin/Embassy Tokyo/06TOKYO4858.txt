SUBJECT: DEMARCHE IN SUPPORT OF U.S. PROPOSAL FOR THE ICAO AVSEC 
PANEL IN MONTREAL, SEPT. 11-15 
 
REF: STATE 112194 
 
¶1. (U) Per reftel, talking points were delivered by ECOUNS to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on August 14, and to Ministry of 
Land, Infrastructure and Transportation (MLIT) on August 18. 
 
¶2. (SBU) MOFA Director of Specialized Agencies Division, Mr. 
Yoichiro Yamada said that he understands the USG proposal for ICAO 
Security Manual and agreed to consider supporting the U.S. view at 
AVSEC.  He said that Japan's current view regarding the X-raying of 
diplomatic pouches differs from the US view. While X-raying of 
diplomatic pouches is undesirable to the GOJ, it is considered 
acceptable if the purpose of the X-ray is to find objects that might 
endanger security and threaten lives of passengers. The GOJ views 
x-raying of diplomatic pouches as different from "opening" of 
diplomatic pouches. Therefore, GOJ's approach has been to ensure 
that the purpose of X-ray searches be strictly to identify the 
objects that endanger security. The GOJ requires a viable and 
convincing explanation to search for security purposes 
 
¶3. (SBU) MLIT Director of International Air Transport Division, Mr. 
Tadashi Shimura said that our taking points will be conveyed to the 
appropriate person in the section within MLIT where aviation 
security is handled, who was on leave.  While noting he was not the 
expert, Shimura said that he assumed that a treaty would take 
precedence over the AVSEC Manuel and that x-raying had been an issue 
with a neighboring country.
