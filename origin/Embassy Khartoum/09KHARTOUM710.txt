SUBJECT:  MAY 25 SESSION OF GRANVILLE/ABBAS MURDER TRIAL 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  On May 25, 2009, U.S. Embassy Foreign Service 
National (FSN) employees from the Regional Security Office, 
Political/Economic, and Public Affairs sections attended the trial 
of five Sudanese men accused in the January 1, 2008 murders of USAID 
Officer John Granville and FSN driver Abdelrahman Abbas.  The court 
called one witness to testify, Brigadier Saleem Imo Hassan Musa, who 
is a weapons expert in the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF).  During the 
May 17th trial session, the defense claimed  that ammunition casings 
found at the scene of the crime could only be used to identify the 
type of weapon  fired and  not the specific weapon used to commit 
the crime.  Musa refuted this by pointing out that various weapons 
use the same ammunition, and that identification of a specific 
weapon can be linked to the markings left on the shell casing.  The 
next court date is scheduled for June 1, 2009, when the prosecution 
will submit its closing argument in written format to the judge. 
The defense will present its written closing argument on June 10, 
2009, with a verdict announcement scheduled to be released at 11:00 
a.m. on June 24, 2009.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  (U)  The trial of the five Sudanese men accused of the January 
1, 2008 murders of USAID Officer John Granville and FSN driver 
Abdelrahman Abbas continued on May 25, 2009.  The prosecution was 
represented by Chair Mohamed Mustafa Musa, Juma Al Wakul Al-Asir, 
and Granville family attorney Taha Ibrahim.  Abbas family attorney, 
Ismail Abu Sugra, was absent.  The defense was represented by deputy 
defense Chair Adil Abdul Ghani and Wajdi Salih.  Defense Chair, 
Siddiq Kadoda, and Ahmed Abu Alga were not present.  Security was 
unusually tight in the court room.  There was a large number of 
police officers present.  Those attending were also screened by K-9 
units. 
 
¶3.  (U)  In order to clarify testimony presented by the defense and 
prosecution weapons experts, the court called Brigadier Saleem Imo 
Hassan Musa, an active duty officer in the SAF, to testify.  Musa 
currently serves as an Inspector General in the SAF Ammunition and 
Explosives Department.  He received weapons training from  Russia 
and also attended numerous seminars on ballistic analysis in Egypt, 
England, Syria and the U.S. 
 
¶4.  (U) The court began the questioning by asking Musa if ammunition 
is the principal factor in determining which type of weapon was 
used.  Musa stated that weapons fire specific types of ammunition. 
Musa was shown a variety of random 9 mm and 8 mm pistols.  Based on 
the shell casings found on the ground at the crime scene, Musa 
stated that a 9 mm caliber pistol was the only weapon that could 
have fired the 9 mm rounds.  Musa also stated that a variety of 
Kalashinikov  automatic rifles could have fired ammunition matching 
the caliber of the shell casings found in the vehicle.  Musa 
explained that each casing will have unique markings based on the 
weapon from which it is fired. 
 
¶5.  (U)  The prosecution asked the witness which government entity 
is responsible for matching the casings found at crime scenes with 
those fired in test experiments.   Musa stated that the Sudanese 
Police Criminal Investigations Division (CID) is responsible for 
matching the casings as they have the proper ballistic analysis 
equipment. 
 
¶6.  (U)  The defense asked the witness about the relationship 
between the SAF and the CID.  Musa responded that the SAF does not 
have the sort of equipment used by CID.  The defense asked Musa if 
he agreed with the statement, "The ammunition used is the most 
important factor when identifying markings."  Musa disagreed, saying 
it is the weapon that is the most important factor.  The defense 
argued that different types of weapons could fire similar caliber 
rounds.  Musa agreed, but clarified that the type of munitions could 
vary even though they are the same caliber.  The defense argued that 
a tight grouping of 9 mm rounds can only be fired by an automatic 
weapon and not by a pistol.  Musa argued that a pistol could fire a 
tight shot group. 
 
¶7.  (U)  The prosecution's written closing arguments are due by June 
1, 2009.  The defense will have an opportunity review the 
prosecution's argument before submitting their final written closing 
argument on June 10, 2009.  The verdict  is scheduled to be released 
at 11:00 a.m. on June 24, 2009.
