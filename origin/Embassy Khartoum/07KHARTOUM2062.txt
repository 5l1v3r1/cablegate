SUBJECT: SECTION 565 WAIVER 
 
¶1. (SBU) Khartoum requests waiver of the requirements of 
Section 565 of Title V, Part C of the Foreign Relations 
Authorizations Act for the reasons contained in paragraph two. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Both the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which 
ended the 21-year civil war in 2005, and the Interim National 
Constitution guarantee the rights of non-Muslims in Khartoum, 
and the secular Sudan People,s Liberation Movement (SPLM) is 
part of the new Government of National Unity (GNU). However, 
in practice, Sharia law continues to be enforced in Khartoum 
and Islamic fundamentalists maintain effective control of the 
government. While initially becoming more tolerant after the 
signing of the peace agreement, security forces backed by 
Islamic fundamentalists have orchestrated several crackdowns 
on the press and civil society organizations in 2007. To 
require firms to sign or accept such a certification would 
subject them to possible harassment by Government of Sudan 
organizations or by fundamentalist organizations. Local 
companies would not sign or accept such a certification and 
there are not available alternative sources for essential 
services and supplies. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Language from last year's justification for 
certification and waiver remains valid as it pertains to 
Sudan.
