¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: U.S. and GNU officials signed a Protocol 
implementing USD 21 million in voter education and domestic 
observation programs for Sudan's 2010 national elections to be 
implemented by the National Democratic Institute.   The protocol is 
the third in a series which also provides assistance to the National 
Election Commission, and to political parties in the North. 
Although the 2008 National Elections Act provides for domestic 
observation of elections by Sudanese civil society, NEC officials 
negotiating this Protocol clearly had concerns about civil society. 
SUMMARY. 
 
VOTER EDUCATION PROTOCOL SIGNED 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Minister of International Cooperation. Dr. Eltigani Saleh 
Fidail, NEC Deputy Chairman, Professor Abdalla Ahmed Abdalla, Charge 
d'Affaires (CDA), USAID Director and National Democratic Institute 
(NDI) Country Director Hatim Bamehriz signed an Implementation 
Protocol for USD 21 million to support voter education and domestic 
observation programs for Sudan's 2010 national elections in Khartoum 
on August 5. The ceremony took place at the National Elections 
Commission office in Khartoum. 
 
¶3. (U) Through the Implementation Protocol, the U.S. Government will 
fund voter education activities to inform voters across Sudan about 
participation in the electoral process.  In addition, the program 
will provide assistance to Sudanese electoral observers, including 
training and other support for observation teams, which will enable 
Sudanese observers to confirm first-hand the credibility of their 
electoral process.  NDI will implement the activities in partnership 
with the NEC and Sudanese civil society organizations.  The protocol 
is the third in a series of implementation protocols USAID has 
negotiated and signed to support the elections.  The first enabled 
IFES to provide assistance to the NEC, and the second enabled the 
International Republican Institute (IRI) to provide multiparty 
training for political parties in the North. 
 
¶4. (U) CDA told participants, print and broadcast media, and others 
in attendance that the U.S. Government is committed to helping 
Sudanese voters across the country participate knowledgeably in the 
electoral process.  The CDA stressed the U.S. Government's 
commitment to the 2010 national elections.  The NEC Deputy Chairman 
thanked the United States for its technical and material support for 
what he called an historic, yet complex, national election.    The 
NEC Chairman said that the voters face significant challenges that 
can be met through civic education, voter education, and capacity 
building.  He called voter education  crucial for reducing confusion 
that could trigger election violence.  The NEC Chairman said that 
the Sudanese government is committed to free and fair elections. 
 
¶5.  (U) COMMENT:  This protocol is a vital component of the U.S. 
Government's support for the 2010 national elections, a critical 
milestone in the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement.  END COMMENT.
