SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On December 12, Special Envoy Natsios met with 11 
members of the Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) NGO Forum 
Steering Committee in Khartoum to solicit their perspectives 
on the humanitarian situation in Darfur.  Oxfam, Help Age, 
Tearfund, the International Rescue Committee (IRC), Norwegian 
Refugee Council (NRC), GOAL, CARE International, Catholic 
Relief Services (CRS) and Action Contre la Faim (ACF) 
represented the council at the meeting.  Discussions focused 
on the deteriorating security environment and the varying 
situations in the three Darfur states.  NGOs have developed, 
and in many cases are implementing, contingency plans.  If 
the trend in violence continues, it will be very difficult 
for aid organizations to continue operating at the current 
level, limiting assistance to affected populations.  End 
summary and comment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
HARASSMENT, IMPEDIMENTS - ALL IN A DAY'S WORK 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Humanitarian agencies voiced their concerns about 
increased intimidation from a number of parties.  Although 
the motives for the December 7 shooting at the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) house in Kutum, North 
Darfur, remain speculative, the fact that such an act 
occurred was "a bad sign."  (Comment.  In West Darfur, both 
NGOs and the UN believe that humanitarian agencies are being 
directly targeted.  End comment.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Government of National Unity (GNU) sensitivity has 
resulted in a reduction in protection-related programming. 
One NGO representative stated that the humanitarian community 
has gone head-to-head with the GNU, particularly since IRC 
issued a press release about sexual assaults in Kalma camp in 
August.  The GNU accuses NGOs of collecting and providing 
intelligence to foreign governments, as well as providing 
opposition groups with logistical support, such as vehicles 
and radios.  SE Natsios stated that he rebuffed these 
accusations, telling the GNU directly that NGOs were not the 
source of USG information on the situation in Darfur and that 
the USG has other sources for such information. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The NRC representative indicated that its expulsion 
from South Darfur has had a chilling effect on both the scope 
of protection reporting as well as organizations' willingness 
to engage in protection issues.  (Note:  The spate of recent 
evacuations from El Fasher, Kutum, Kulbus, Silea, Sirba, 
Sanidadi, and Ed Daein reduced humanitarian access to 
vulnerable populations.  The withdrawal has hamstrung 
protection reporting in all evacuated areas until 
humanitarians can return.  End note.)  One representative 
stressed that NGOs do not simply distribute items, but 
provide a full package of services to internally displaced 
persons (IDPs) and that the GNU should accept this.  NGOs 
expressed concern that NRC's expulsion could become a 
precedent. 
 
¶5. (SBU) NGO representatives requested the expansion of the 
UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) 
in Darfur, stating that OCHA played an important role as a 
buffer between the GNU and NGOs, and that OCHA presence was 
needed outside of the major towns.  SE Natsios requested a 
list of the locations where NGOs thought an OCHA presence 
would be beneficial. 
 
¶6. (SBU) SE Natsios also told participants that GNU Minister 
of Humanitarian Affairs Kosti Manibe had informed the U.S. 
delegation that the GNU had extended the Moratorium on 
Restrictions until January 31, 2008.  The NGOs asked SE 
Natsios to request a formal GNU written statement to that 
effect.  Humanitarian representatives insisted that the GNU 
issue the statement before the end of the week, in order to 
provide sufficient time for the GNU Humanitarian Aid 
Commission (HAC) to be informed of the extension.

AMIS 
---- 
 
¶7. (SBU) NGOs indicated a severe need for African Union 
Mission in Sudan (AMIS) patrols to provide protection around 
camps and conflict-affected areas.  Firewood patrols are 
sporadic, and in critical areas, AMIS no longer conducts 
them.  When OCHA requested that AMIS resume firewood patrols 
in Kalma camp near Nyala, the AMIS representative responded, 
"Only if we feel safe."  SE Natsios and CDA Hume responded 
that AMIS has a siege mentality, and that only a change at 
the highest levels of the military leadership would foment a 
more robust approach. 
 
¶8. (SBU) NGO representatives reported that AMIS has begun 
implementing quick-impact projects (QIPs) in Darfur in an 
effort to win hearts and minds.  Those present felt quite 
strongly that this was an encroachment on humanitarian space 
and dangerous for NGOs, because such actions suggest that 
AMIS and NGOs serve the same function or may be 
collaborating.  Those present agreed that AMIS should focus 
on peacekeeping and protection. 
 
----------------------------------- 
DARFUR SECURITY SITUATION WORSENING 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) The GNU continues to implement a policy of divide 
and conquer, an approach that seems to have "atomized" Darfur 
and created numerous additional independent armed actors with 
no hierarchy.  One NGO stated that some people in the IDP 
camps were "carrying so many weapons that they couldn't 
move."  Targeting of civilians has increased, particularly in 
West Darfur. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Responding to a question from SE Natsios, the NGO 
representatives said they had not heard of any atrocities 
carried out by the National Redemption Front, G19, or other 
armed groups.  SE Natsios said that the opposition 
intelligence network was very good and that people are 
pre-evacuated before an attack.  He said that this explained 
the limited number of new displacements in North Darfur.  One 
NGO mentioned that in North Darfur, villagers and others in 
opposition-held areas have radios that can intercept Antonov 
communications.  When Antonov target locations are 
identified, villagers evacuate before the attack begins, and 
return once the bombers have departed. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) SE Natsios requested that the agencies provide him 
with key information following attacks, such as what tribes 
have been attacked and displaced; whether any atrocities have 
been committed; and whether organizations see build-ups of 
arms in IDP camps.  SE Natsios indicated he would also 
appreciate knowledge of increased Janjaweed presence.  The 
participants indicated a willingness to provide that 
information, but not directly from Sudan. 
 
-------------- 
PLAN B ANXIETY 
-------------- 
 
¶12.  (SBU) When asked about "Plan B," SE Natsios responded 
that while he would not discuss the details, the implications 
of "Plan B" would be severe and that several governments in 
addition to the USG would be behind it.  Should "Plan B" be 
implemented, it would not be a gradual ramping-up of 
pressure, and NGOs should be making contingency plans now. 
SE Natsios stated that the GNU uses NGOs and IDPs to 
blackmail the international community into inaction, and that 
such manipulation would not be allowed to continue.  He 
indicated that NGOs and the international community would be 
informed in advance of activating a "Plan B" that would 
impact humanitarian programs.  He indicated that the USG 
would change policy in January if there was no significant 
improvement on the ground in Sudan.
