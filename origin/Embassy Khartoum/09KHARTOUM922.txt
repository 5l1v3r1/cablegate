¶1. (SBU) Summary: A Government of Sudan (GOS) force comprised of 
Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Arab militia clashed with Justice 
and Equality Movement (JEM) forces in the area of Mellit in North 
Darfur on August 5, according to UN and rebel sources.  The clashes 
resulted in four  dead and 19 injured on the GOS side, while JEM 
casualties  are unknown. JEM is since believed to have retreated to 
the Wadi Hawar area on the Chad-Sudan border. Separately, UNAMID was 
investigating alleged clashes on August 6 between the SAF and 
Chadian National Army (ANT) at Jebel Kulbus in West Darfur. End 
Summary.

TRACKING JEM'S MOVEMENTS THROUGH 
NORTH DARFUR 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On July 31, the UN Department of Safety and Security 
(UNDSS) received reports that a convoy of JEM vehicles had been 
spotted in Habib Germa in the Alliet locality in North Darfur.  A 
UNDSS Officer told Poloff that the convoy contained 16 vehicles. 
(NOTE: If loaded with the standard 6 men each, this would give JEM a 
company strength of 96 men. END NOTE.) The convoy was believed to be 
returning from the Muglad area of Southern Kordofan (formerly 
Western Kordofan) where JEM is thought to have a sleeper cell. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On August 1-2, the GOS reportedly targeted the JEM convoy 
with aerial strikes. Antonov bombers were seen flying over areas 
north of El Daien, including Abu Sufyan and Um Sauna.  Ground 
fighting between the GOS and JEM reportedly took place in several 
locations in the Adilla and Alliet localities, though this could not 
be confirmed by UNDSS. Speaking to Poloff on August 3, rebels from 
SLA/Abdul Wahid confirmed the presence of JEM in eastern North 
Darfur, but were unaware of any fighting.  They noted they expected 
JEM to stay clear of their stronghold, the "liberated zone" of Jebel 
Marra, and instead, return to Chad through the corridor north of El 
Fasher.

CLASHES IN MELLIT 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Confirmed clashes between the GOS and JEM took place on 
August 5 in the area of Mellit.  A mixed GOS force comprised of SAF 
and Arab militia confronted the JEM convoy in Abjera (approximately 
15 kilometers from Mellit), according to the findings of a UNAMID 
investigative patrol. UNAMID sources told Poloff the exchange of 
fire lasted three hours and that JEM is since believed to have 
retreated with their casualties to the Wadi Hawar area along the 
Chad-Sudan border. The number of JEM casualties is unknown.  On the 
GOS side, the fighting resulted in 4 dead and 19 injured. 
 
----------------------------- 
ATTACK IN KORDOFAN UNRELATED? 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Separately, Sudanese media reported that on August 2, the 
Kordofan Alliance for Development (KAD), supported by JEM, attacked 
the area of Samuwa on the railway between Babanousa and Al Fula town 
in Southern Kordofan.  SAF successfully repelled the attack, though 
five of its soldiers were injured and taken to the hospital in 
Muglad for treatment.  No independent verification of the attack 
could be obtained. (NOTE: Little is known about KAD, but it is said 
to be composed of representatives from several tribes, including the 
Hamar, Kababish and Misseriya. Misseriya leadership does not support 
this group because it has little influence over it, and because the 
group includes many non-Misseriya. END NOTE.) 
 
------------------------------------- 
RUMORS OF NEW SAF CLASHES WITH ANT IN 
WEST DARFUR 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) UNAMID sources also told Poloff they were attempting to 
verify fresh allegations of clashes between the SAF and ANT in West 
Darfur (Reftel).  A UNAMID investigative team met with a SAF 
commander in Kulbus who reported that on August 6 he received 
information that armed Chadian soldiers on four vehicles had entered 
Sudanese territory and were heading towards Aroua village (N 140 18' 
10'' E 220 28' 00''), a village which they raided and looted 
approximately two weeks prior.  The SAF commander dispatched his men 
in two vehicles to stop them. They engaged the Chadian troops at 
Jebal Kulbus (N 140 30' 00'' E 220 26' 50'') who retreated into 
 
KHARTOUM 00000922  002 OF 002 
 
 
their territory.  No casualty figure was reported.  The SAF 
Commander then contacted his Chadian counterpart by phone to find 
out why his soldiers had again entered Sudanese territory despite 
his earlier promise that his troops would no longer do so. The 
Chadian commander replied that his troops were chasing two of their 
soldiers who had deserted. UNAMID plans to monitor the situation 
closely. 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT: There are several possible motives for JEM's foray 
into Darfur and Southern Kordofan.  While it is possible JEM 
traveled to Muglad to stir up trouble in the area following the 
Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) decision on Abyei, it is more 
likely that JEM is exploring alternatives to its base in Um Jaras, 
Chad should the GOC deny them this safe haven.  Southern Kordofan, 
the desolate Wadi Hawar area on the Sudan-Chad border, and even the 
Central African Republic are all possibilities for new JEM 
encampments.  The alleged clashes between SAF and ANT in West 
Darfur, meanwhile, is disquieting.  Though Chadian armed opposition 
forces have pulled back from the border areas, tensions between the 
SAF and ANT remain high and the potential remains for incidents like 
this to escalate quickly.  END COMMENT.
