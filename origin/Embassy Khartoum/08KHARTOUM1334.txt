¶1. (SBU) On September 1, Charge d'Affaires Fernandez met with the 
Fur "Maqdoom" of South Darfur Ahmed Adam Rijal, to convey  his 
private condolences to the Fur leader following the killings of at 
least 33 IDPs at Kalma camp on August 24.  Visibly upset, the 
Maqdoom recounted that this tragedy is part of a long history of 
violence originating in Khartoum and perpetrated against Darfuris, a 
history that predates the National Congress Party (NCP) to the time 
of the Mahdi more than a century ago.  The elderly but feisty Rijal 
criticized the regime's attempts at distancing themselves from the 
violence at Kalma camp, saying, "They were intending to do that. 
Their intention is to exterminate the Fur tribe." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Rijal agreed with CDA's assertion that the situation in 
Nyala is exacerbated by the divisive and weak  Wali of South Darfur, 
Ali Mahmoud, a member of one of Darfur's Arab tribes, the Taisha. 
Rijal believes the violence at Kalma to be part of a larger plan 
aimed at displacing IDPs from camps across Darfur, but only the Wali 
of South Darfur complied with the plan.. "The North Darfur and West 
Darfur governors did not consent to orders to hit IDP camps in 
Geneina and El Fasher," Rijal said, and regarding Mahmoud, he added, 
"He has lost his senses."  The other two Darfur Governors are from 
Darfur's African tribes. Commenting on Mahmoud's failed tenure in 
Nyala, Rijal connected it with the Government of Sudan's 
catastrophic inability to pacify and govern the impoverished region: 
"The government has to acknowledge that Darfuris are the only 
Sudanese entitled to rule Darfur." 
 
¶3. (SBU) "The government of Sudan is in total collapse," Rijal said. 
"It is obvious. But who is calling the shots?" Rijal sees the Shagia 
tribal faction of Vice President Taha, Finance Minister Al Jaz, and 
Security Minister Salah Gosh as ascendant in Sudanese politics, 
eclipsing the powerful Ja'alin tribal faction of President al-Bashir 
and Presidential Assistant Nafie. A university classmate of Hassan 
al-Turabi, Rijal views  the former prime minister and reformed 
Islamist as vindictive and willing to do anything he can to push out 
the ruling regime. He sarcastically noted that, despite Turabi's 
ostracism, the NCP inner elite is still deferential to him. "Taha, 
who was his student once, still kisses his hand when he sees him at 
weddings or funerals."   In contrast to his harsh words for the NCP, 
Rijal closed the meeting by thanking the CDA for his August meeting 
with Presidential Special Envoy Richard Williamson, and calling for 
continued bipartisan USG attention to the crisis in Darfur.  He 
added that as the US progresses through the 2008 election cycle, "We 
are happy the two parties have taken an interest in Darfur." 
 
4, (SBU) Comment: Rijal's declining health has had little effect in 
diminishing his high-level of credibility among Darfuris, and it is 
telling that he  supports two widely circulated theories on the 
recent events in Darfur: first, that Khartoum ordered the Kalma 
violence; and second, that the hijacking of the Sun Air flight 
several days later was orchestrated to distract international 
attention from the killings.  While the first theory is certainly 
possible, the second seems a little far-fetched, though nothing 
would surprise us in Sudan.  Partly as a consequence of the GOS's 
reckless behavior in Nyala last week, Rijal  will likely play an 
increasingly prominent role in determining how the Fur of South 
Darfur engage the ruling regime. And he is an angry old man who 
believes that the only way to improve things in Darfur is to hasten 
the end of NCP rule. End comment.
