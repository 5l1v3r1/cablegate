the South and its elections strategy.  Clearly, the SPLM sees the 
indictments as a possible threat to the implementation of the CPA, 
and is focused on how to keep the CPA on track no matter what.  The 
SPLM is always eager to seek additional leverage against the NCP and 
views a possible run (or threat to run) by Kiir for the national 
presidency in this regard.  The problem of who would run in Kiir's 
place in the South, and what the party would do if Kiir loses in the 
national election, has not been fully addressed.  Presumably the 
SPLM will say Kiir intends to run in the national election until the 
last possible minute, to gain leverage with the NCP, and then strike 
a deal to keep the status quo.  It is certainly hard to imagine 
anyone else besides Salva Kiir being president of the GOSS in the 
sensitive and historic years leading up to the 2011 referendum on 
Southern independence.
