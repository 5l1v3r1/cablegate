¶1.  Summary:  Protesters and police clashed on August 28 during a 
demonstration over recent price increases. Opposition parties plan 
to present a memorandum objecting to the price increases to 
President Bashir on Wednesday.  The Council of Ministers has 
endorsed the action of the Minister of Finance in raising prices, 
but opposition parties are still seeking to debate the question in 
the National Assembly.  End Summary. 
 
Police Move on Protesters 
------------------------- 
 
¶2.  The prices of sugar, gasoline and diesel fuel increased 
following a tax increase on sugar and reduction of subsidies for 
fuel (reftels).  On August 28, the Sudan Forum, a new grouping of 
opposition parties, held a meeting at the University of Khartoum to 
protest the price increases.  Those attending the meeting included 
leaders of the opposition parties such as Umma, DUP, Bathiest, Umma 
Reform and Renovation, Sudanese Congress Party, and the Communist 
Party, as well as University of Khartoum professors.  Speakers at 
the meeting reportedly demanded that the Minister of Finance and the 
Minister of Energy and Mining explain in the National Assembly why 
budget shortfalls occurred and why the price increases were 
implemented.  Following the meeting, participants staged a 
demonstration in the street outside the meeting hall.  Riot police 
using sticks and tear gas moved to disperse the demonstrators. 
Suliman El-Amin, Spokesman of the Sudan Forum, was reported to be 
seriously injured and was taken to hospital. 
 
March Planned for Wednesday 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3.  According to local press sources, the leaders of the main 
opposition parties are planning a peaceful procession on the 
afternoon of Wednesday, August 30, to march to the Palace and hand 
over a 'memorandum' to the President explaining their rejection of 
the price increases. 
 
¶4.  On Sunday, August 27, the Council of Ministers gave its 
endorsement to the Minister of Finance's decision to raise prices. 
Opposition party leaders, including SPLM members of Parliament, are 
seeking to have the issue of price increases debated in the National 
Assembly.  However, the National Assembly is currently in recess. 
The Council of Ministers' endorsement of the Minister of Finance's 
decision further reduces the possibility that the National Assembly 
debate could lead to a change in the decision to raise prices.
