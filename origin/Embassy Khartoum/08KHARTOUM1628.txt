Re:  Congratulatory Message 
 
It is with great honor and deep admiration that I offer you 
congratulations on behalf of the Government and people of Southern 
Sudan, on your historic election to become the 44th President of the 
United States of America. 
 
We have watched your campaign and election with awe and inspiration. 
 To people of Southern Sudan who are still struggling to heal the 
scars and wounds of civil war and remedy the injustice of oppression 
and marginalization, your message of change carries a special 
resonance of hope in Sudan.  With your election, the people of the 
United States of America have also shown us the pride and strength 
that comes in the celebration of her diversity. 
 
The aspirations of people of Southern Sudan remain blighted by the 
tragedies of war and poverty, and the legacy of a system that does 
not treat all citizens as equal. We have a vision of bringing a real 
change to Sudan to become a country where citizens regardless of 
their religion and ethnicity will have opportunity to contribute to 
making Sudan a better place for all.  This vision is enshrined in 
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement through a democratic 
transformation:  that democratic institutions are the foundations of 
a just society; that free elections have the power to bring a real 
change in the country; and that all citizens should have a stake in 
charting the future course of Sudan. 
 
We are invigorated by your message and further hope that through our 
continued partnership, we will be able to fully implement the CPA 
and to bring a lasting peace to Darfur, the region and the whole 
world at large.  I will avail myself to work closely with you as one 
of your strategic allies. 
 
I wish you good health and success with the guidance of Almighty 
God.
