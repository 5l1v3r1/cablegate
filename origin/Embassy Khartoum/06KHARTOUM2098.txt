rejection of UN peacekeepers.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  Sudan TV, in its 10 p.m. news on August 30, showed footage of 
President Bashir addressing the National Youth Conference. 
Repeating his government's rejection of international intervention, 
he stated, "We are ready to face international forces even if they 
enter Khartoum; we reject the British draft resolution."
