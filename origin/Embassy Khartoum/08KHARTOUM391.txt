U.S. Secretary of State,

Washington, D.C., 
United States of America 
 
Dear Mme Secretary, 
 
Ref: Exemption of SPLM Officials from U.S. Sanctions 
 
Let me first convey to you my very best wishes for the New Year 
2008, hoping that it will be a year of peace and tranquility, though 
this is not easy in the tumultuous world we live in. However, as far 
as Sudan is concerned, I wish to reiterate what I have told you in 
Washington late last year that we are committed to the consolidation 
of peace ushered in by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), as 
well as putting an end to the war in Darfur.  That war shames us all 
and consequently we shall leave no stone unturned till we bring 
peace to Darfur. 
 
Having put to rights the crisis we have gone through with the NCP 
and, without lowering our guard, we are now focusing on bringing 
together leaders of the different Darfurian factions so that they 
speak at the peace forum with one voice. We know and appreciate, Mme 
Secretary, what the U.S. Government, under the able leadership of 
 
SIPDIS 
President Bush, has invested in Sudan's Peace, especially the CPA 
and the Abuja Agreement. 
 
I am also seizing this opportunity to bring to your attention a 
problem faced by the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) 
political officials who serve in the Government of National Unity 
(GONU). In view of the Executive Order prohibiting transactions with 
that Government, including its senior officials, the U.S. Treasury 
has ordered all Banks (including the majority of leading non - U.S. 
Banks in Europe) to close accounts of individuals belonging to Sudan 
Government. That has affected the interest of some of our SPLM 
ministers serving in GONU. However, the same Executive Order 
exempted activities or related transactions with respect to Southern 
Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains, Blue Nile State, and Abyei 
Area. The definition of those areas, for the purposes of the 
Executive Order, is left to your good self, in consultation with the 
U.S. Treasury. 
 
Equally, I wish to recall the provision in Public Law 109-344 (109th 
Congress) of October 13th, 2006, which defined in section 2 para. 6 
'Officials of the Government of Sudan - The term "official of the 
Government of Sudan" does not include any individual(A) who was not 
a member of such government before July 1, 2005; or ( B) who is a 
member of the regional government of Southern Sudan' (end of 
quote). 
 
I am, therefore, appealing to you Mme Secretary to consider ways and 
means of shielding our SPLM senior political officials serving in 
GONU as per the CPA. Many of those officials, who were either living 
abroad or serving in international organizations, have accounts in 
foreign banks. Of late, some of those banks, at the behest of the 
U.S. Treasury, were indiscriminately asked to close accounts of all 
GONU officials. That regrettably, included accounts of SPLM 
ministers despite the exemption referred to above. I am, therefore, 
enclosing herewith the names of those SPLM officials affected. 
 
Please accept, Mme Secretary, my thanks and highest consideration. 
 
Yours Sincerely, 
Salva Kiir Mayardit 
Chairman of the SPLM, 
First Vice President of the Republic of the Sudan, 
President of GOSS, 
Juba, Southern Sudan, 
Republic of the Sudan
