SUBJECT: UNMIS REGIONAL COORDINATOR ON THE SITUATION IN ABYEI AND 
THE STATUS OF LRA PEACE TALKS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: In a July 25 meeting with ConGen Juba, UNMIS 
Regional Coordinator for Southern Sudan David Gressley reported that 
over a thousand SAF have now withdrawn from Abyei, leaving only 
approximately 100 in Abyei town who are expected to leave on the 
26th or 27th of July.  Gressley planned to travel to Abyei on the 
26th to attend a ceremony to officially install the new Joint 
Integrated Unit (JIU) in Abyei that will now secure the town in 
place of the SAF.  In regard to LRA peace talks, Gressley reported 
that Joseph Kony is still talking to the UN and GOSS Vice President 
Machar, but they had been unable to set a time when he would meet to 
discuss signing a peace treaty. End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Gressley reported that he would be leaving Juba on July 26 
to witness the departure of the last of the SAF forces, 
approximately 100 soldiers, from Abyei town.  Following their 
departure, he will attend a turnover ceremony in which the new JIU 
force will take over providing security for Abyei.  Although this 
JIU has been trained and has been ready for this assignment for the 
last few weeks, they have been waiting for the complete departure of 
the SAF before taking over their new duties. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Gressley said that although UNMIS was ready to begin 
training 300 police, 150 from the North and 150 from the South, 
there were now disagreements between the SPLM and NCP over where to 
train them.  The NCP wants them trained in Khartoum instead of 
Abyei, and the SPLM wants all the police to be issued ID cards, 
while the NCP only wants the police to wear patches on their 
shoulders identifying them as police.  The SPLM opposes this because 
the patches will not identify individual members of the force, and 
can be given to others to wear. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Also according to Gressley, there is still no progress on 
selecting an Administrator or Deputy for Abyei, as called for in the 
Road Map Agreement.  In his talks with the SPLM on the issue, he 
said they seemed in no hurry to work out a final agreement on this 
issue with the NCP. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On the issue of peace talks with the Lord's Resistance Army 
(LRA), Gressley said there was nothing new to report except that the 
UN negotiators continue to talk to Kony by satellite phone.  There 
are hopes that a meeting will be arranged later next week, but 
Gressley admitted that he thought it was not likely.  Still, he 
said, the plan is to continue to try to sign the peace agreement, 
and hopes remain that this can still be done.  Kony and GOSS Vice 
President Machar are now also talking on the phone. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: The full implementation of the Abyei Road Map 
Agreement is now almost a month behind schedule, with little 
indication that an Administrator and Deputy will be appointed any 
time soon.  Still, if the SAF does fully withdraw as expected and 
the JIU takes its place, and if the new police force gets up and 
running, tensions will be reduced and it is likely that IDPs will 
begin to return in large numbers. The presence of the SAF 31st 
Brigade in the heart of Abyei town, using a girls' school as a 
barracks, has been a sore point for the local population for 
decades.  Without an Administrator in place, Gressley indicated that 
the UN would not help or encourage returns, but as people deemed it 
safe to go home, there was nothing the UN could or would do to try 
to stop them.  Post views it as critical that an administration be 
put in place rapidly, lest political tensions rise again as local 
self-appointed or party-appointed leaders in Abyei begin to agitate. 
 We will raise this with both parties and this would be an important 
point for senior officials to raise during future visits to Sudan.
