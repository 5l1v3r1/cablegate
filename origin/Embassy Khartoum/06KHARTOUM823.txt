SUBJECT: MFA Convokes Ambassadors, GNU Outlines New 
Foreign Policy Objectives 
 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  The MFA has convened its ambassadorial 
corps for a conference to re-examine directions in 
Sudanese diplomacy.  Senior government officials 
addressing the opening session noted the realities of the 
CPA, pressures from abroad, new leadership, the role of 
membership in international organizations, and the need 
to address the question of North-South unity as critical 
issues.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On April 1, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held 
an opening session for a five-day conference to 
deliberate on the nation's foreign policy objectives. 
The event, the first of its kind in three years, convened 
Sudan's ambassadors from more than 50 overseas missions. 
With perhaps 200 government officials and perhaps 30 
diplomatic guests in attendance, the opening featured 
remarks in Arabic by MFA Under Secretary Mutriff Saddiq, 
Foreign Minister Lam Akol, and Vice President Ali Osman 
Taha.  The MFA distributed a paper in Arabic on foreign 
policy directions; it will be sent by septel.  (Comment: 
a retired ambassador advised that the MFA would soon 
rotate ambassadors, with the new team reflecting the 
diversity of the Government of National Unity.  End 
comment.)

Mutriff:  CPA, Challenges from Abroad, New Vision Key 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶3. (U) U/S Mutriff noted that the MFA had not organized a 
like conference in a long time, and said that it was now 
being held to address the new political realities created 
by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), the 
challenges faced by Sudan from abroad, and the new 
visions that the ministry's leadership wished to chart.

FM: Analyze Challenges, Seek Solutions, Make Unity Goal 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶4. (U) Minister Akol said the conference would give an 
opportunity to Sudanese diplomats to analyze challenges 
thoroughly and seek modern solutions.  He added that the 
CPA has freed Sudan from the burdens of war; the key is 
to devote energies now for the development of the country 
and its people.  The focus of Sudanese diplomacy in the 
coming years is to make North-South unity attractive.

VP Taha: Diplomacy a Tool, Use Organizations for Benefit 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶5. (U) The Vice President noted that diplomacy is 
important as a state tool, both in war and in peace. 
This has produced results, as the CPA brought both peace 
and the Government of National Unity.  Sudan sees that 
many in the international community are in a state of 
mutual suspicion.  How do we reassure one another 
mutually, he asked.  Sudan is party to many agreements, 
and belongs to several international organizations.  What 
benefits has it derived from this?  If Sudan is not using 
these circumstances to its benefit, it is giving them up 
as lost.  Finally, Sudan needs to reorient its foreign 
policy to address its domestic realities.  Its policies 
should also be anchored in Sudan's history.
