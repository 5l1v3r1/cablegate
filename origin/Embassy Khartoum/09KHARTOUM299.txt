SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On March 1, the Government of National Unity (GNU) 
Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) in Khartoum told representatives 
of CHF International,EedeCans S`ns FrontIeres%Net`erlands (MSF/H), 
Solidarites, CARE International, MSF/France (MSF/F), and OXFAM 
International that, for security reasons, the organizations should 
relocate expatriate (ex-pat) staff temporarily to Khartoui from 
camps and towns in selected areas of Darfur.  However, during a 
meeting with UN/OCHA March 3, the HAC abruptly changed course and 
agreed to allow the NGO staff to remain in Nyala and El Fasher.  The 
HAC stressed that this is not an evacuation and staff will soon be 
allowed to return to their field assignments in Darfur.  Separately, 
IRC had already made a decision to relocate international staff to 
Khartoum for security reasons due to accusations by the GOS that the 
IRC provided information to the ICC.  However, for the moment IRC 
continues to implement programs in Darfur. End summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
CURRENT SITUATION AND GNU HAC DEMANDS 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On March 1, the GNU HAC in Khartoum called a meeting with 
CHF International, MSF/H, Solidarites, CARE International, MSF/F, 
and OXFAM International.  During the meeting, GNU HAC staff advised 
the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that due to security 
reasons, the agencies should relocate ex-pat staff temporarily to 
Khartoum from the following camps and government-held towns in 
Darfur: Abu Shouk, Gereida, Kalma, Kass, Mornei, Muhajeria, Nertiti, 
Shearia, Zalingei.  According to the GNU HAC, the mandatory 
relocations had to take place before the International Criminal 
Court (ICC) announcement scheduled for March 4, and did not apply to 
local and national staff, just ex-pats.  (NOTE: In addition to the 
seven NGOs called to the GNU HAC meeting, other NGOs operate in the 
same areas, providing services to affected populations.  It remains 
unknown whether the GNU HAC forgot about the other aid agencies or 
whether the GNU HAC picked the seven organizations for a more 
specific reason.  Separately, IRC had already made a decision to 
relocate international staff to Khartoum for security reasons due to 
accusations by the GOS that the IRC provided information to the ICC. 
 However, for the moment IRC continues to implement programs in 
Darfur. END NOTE.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Following the March 1 meeting, the NGOs decided to 
relocate expat staff to the state capitals rather back to Khartoum; 
however, on March 2 the GNU HAC Secretary General in South Darfur 
and the local head of National Security (NS) advised the NGOs that 
local authorities could not guarantee security for expat staff in 
Nyala, South Darfur, and therefore staff should to relocate expats 
to Khartoum.  In addition, local sources reported that the GNU HAC 
instructions no longer pertained only to the seven NGOs listed 
above, but was a widespread policy for all NGOs and expat staff in 
the specified areas of Darfur.  As of March 2, USAID staff was 
uncertain whether the new instructions were a local initiative from 
GNU HAC South Darfur and NS, or whether the orders were coming from 
GNU HAC Khartoum. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On March 3, the Joint Special Representative (JSR) of the 
African Union-U.N. Joint Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) Rodolphe Adada 
reported to CDA Fernandez that UNAMID continues to coordinate with 
Darfur authorities on the potential NGO relocation and NGOs should 
not be concerned regarding the outcome and the impact on 
humanitarian programs.  In addition, JSR Adada dismissed the idea of 
the GNU might move against internally displaced person (IDP) camps 
in the absence of expat NGO staff. SLM Leader Minni Minnawi told CDA 
on March 3 that, despite assurances from UNAMID, there is widespread 
uncertainty in IDP camps that the regime could move against them. He 
noted that SLM/MM controlled camps, such as burgeoning Zamzam 
outside El Fasher which has been receiving thousands of Zaghawa IDPs 
from South Darfur, "are ready to defend themselves." 
 
¶5.  (SBU) On March 3, staff from the UN Office for the Coordination 
of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) met with GNU HAC staff, including Mr. 
Mutassem and Mr. Salah HAC/NS.  During the meeting, the GNU HAC and 
OCHA representatives agreed to the following measures and GNU HAC 
staff communicated the information to Mr. Surrur, GNU HAC 
Commissioner in South Darfur and Mr. MohamedSalih, the South Darfur 
wali's Director of International Affairs:  The NGOs instructed to 
 
KHARTOUM 00000299  002 OF 003 
 
 
leave 10 locations in Darfur are permitted to relocate staff to 
Nyala and El Fasher, North Darfur, rather than to Khartoum.  The 
current staff movement is a temporary relocation.  (NOTE: Mr. 
Mutassem insisted that the move is not an evacuation.  END NOTE.) 
and the GNU HAC will reverse the move as soon as possible.  The 
HAC/NS notification for evacuation for international staff of four 
NGOs in Nyala will be cancelled immediately.  (NOTE: Four NGOS 
received notification on the morning of March 3: CARE, MSF/H, 
Solidarits, and Samaritan's Purse.  END NOTE). 
 
¶6. (SBU) In addition, GNU HAC Khartoum staff acknowledged the 
confusion regarding the Nyala information delivery to NGOs and hoped 
that the March 3 phone call to the GNU HAC Commissioner in South 
Darfur would prevent any future confusion. 
 
-------------------------------- 
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A RELOCATION 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) If NGOs complete the mandatory relocation, USAID staff 
note that if there is any humanitarian crisis in the coming days 
(although we do not expect such a crisis at the time of this 
writing) our NGO partners would not be properly positioned in the 
field to provide and coordinate assistance.  USAID staff has 
notified the UN agencies that the US Government will be following 
the situation closely, including UN efforts to ensure the GNU keeps 
its promises to allow NGOs to return to the affected area as soon as 
possible. 
 
---------------------- 
WHY RELOCATE? WHY NOW? 
---------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Post is working to gather additional information on the 
security information that is driving this decision from the GNU HAC. 
 Local and international staff on the ground have speculated that 
the GNU may be planning a major bombing campaign in the areas being 
relocated and does not want NGO staff casualties or "eyes and ears " 
on the ground.  Although such plans are merely theories at the 
moment, this possibility is certainly troubling.  By maintaining a 
staff presence in the camps and affected areas, NGOs provide a 
significant level of protection and security for the local 
populations throughout Darfur.  Without NGO staff on the ground, 
civilians are more vulnerable. 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  (NOTE: In addition to concerns about a potential GNU 
attack on the selected areas, humanitarian NGO staff note other 
possible reasons for the GNU HAC maneuvers to remove expat staff 
from Darfur, including: GNU authorities might be concerned about 
local insecurity and do not want responsibilities that may be 
difficult to meet (protecting international NGO staff); the GNU HAC 
may also be responding to specific, un-publicized threats against 
NGO assets and staff; the GNU authorities may see the current moment 
as an opportunity to further restrict and impede humanitarian 
activities; local authorities are concerned that the IDPs may use 
the March 4 announcement to celebrate and such celebrations may 
trigger official reprisals that the GNU does not want NGO staff to 
witness; and that perhaps the GNU believes the named NGOs are linked 
to the ICC.  END NOTE) 
 
------------------------------------------ 
MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS FOR COMING DAYS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Following the GNU HAC meeting and relocation 
announcements, USAID staff continues to meet with individual 
implementing partners to assess the overall situation on the ground 
and GNU HAC responses to partner queries.  USAID staff also plan to 
contact other NGOs working in the targeted areas and surrounding 
camps to ascertain the additional organizations' current capacity to 
respond to a potential influx of IDPs should security worsen or 
displacement continue following the NGO relocation.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) The most recent meeting and demands by the GNU HAC follow 
closely on a steady increase in levels of NGO staff detainment, 
harassment, interrogation, and asset seizure as the regime 
 
KHARTOUM 00000299  003 OF 003 
 
 
underscores how reliant the international humanitarian effort in 
Darfur is on cooperation by Sudanese authorities.  For now the 
humanitarian community can do nothing more but wait and see how 
things unfold, and if the government is true to its word and allows 
NGOs back into Darfur once the dust settles on the ICC announcement. 
 Embassy staff continue to follow the situation closely to ensure 
NGO staff safety and the continuation of life-saving humanitarian 
assistance to the people of Darfur.
