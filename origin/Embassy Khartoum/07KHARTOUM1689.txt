Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. On October 28, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) reported 
that Rift Valley fever (RVF) has been confirmed in three states in 
northern Sudan.  RVF is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects 
animals but also can infect humans.  WHO reported that out of 70 
known human cases 40 deaths had occurred since the initial reports 
of the disease in late September.  Initially, the fever was 
diagnosed as yellow fever, but laboratory tests have confirmed the 
outbreak is Rift Valley fever instead.  WHO and the Government of 
National Unity (GNU) Ministry of Health (MOH) are leading the 
response to human RVF cases and have deployed teams to the affected 
areas.  The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the GNU 
Ministry of Animal Resources (MOAR) are coordinating efforts in the 
livestock sector.  End Summary.

Affected States in Sudan 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. As of October 28, WHO reported 70 suspected cases of RVF, 
including 40 deaths.  Laboratory tests on human samples have 
confirmed RVF in 20 of those cases.  No animal samples have been 
tested to date. 
 
¶3. RVF has been confirmed in Al Managil locality in Gezira State, Al 
Gabalian and Kosti localities in White Nile State, and Singa 
locality in Sinnar State.  WHO reported that one RVF patient from 
Renk in Upper Nile State was being treated in White Nile, indicating 
that Upper Nile State may also be affected.  WHO informed the 
Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) on this finding.  Recently 
reported cases in Khartoum State were found to have been imported 
from White Nile State.  WHO does not believe that Khartoum State is 
affected at this stage.

Response 
-------- 
 
¶4.  WHO and MOH plan to release a joint response plan in the coming 
days.  WHO has deployed teams to the affected states to collect 
additional samples, identify cases, provide training to health care 
staff, and identify prevention activities. 
 
¶5.  The FAO and MOAR have deployed teams to collect animal samples 
in the affected areas. 
 
¶6.  USAID will continue to participate in task force meetings, 
coordinate with partners on appropriate responses, and report on the 
evolving situation as needed.

Background on Rift Valley Fever 
------------------------------- 
¶7. According to WHO, RVF is a viral disease of animals that can be 
transmitted to humans through infected Aedes mosquitoes that bite 
mostly during the day from just after dawn to just after sunset. 
RVF is not transmitted directly from person to person.  Humans are 
infected with RVF mainly through direct contact with animal body 
fluids such as blood, milk, and raw meat.  RVF is found mostly in 
eastern and southern Africa but is also found throughout sub-Saharan 
Africa. 
¶8. An outbreak can occur if there is increased pooling of water, 
commonly after flooding, leading to increased mosquitoes breeding. 
 
¶9. Most infected people do not have any symptoms or have mild fever. 
 Most people recover within a week.  If the patient has an acute 
case, the symptoms are typically fever, back pain, dizziness, and 
weight loss.  Some cases progress to hemorrhagic fever, 
encephalitis, and eye disease.  As most human cases of RVF are 
relatively mild and short in duration, no specific treatment is 
required for these patients.  For the more severe cases, the 
predominant treatment is general supportive therapy. 
¶10. The most significant effects are usually in the livestock 
sector. 
¶11.  Prevention methods for RVF include avoiding close contact with 
body fluids of livestock, vector control strategies such as 
distribution of long lasting insecticide-treated nets, and 
environmental management, including proper water storage and
