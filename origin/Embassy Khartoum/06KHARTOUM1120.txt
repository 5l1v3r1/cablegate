PRESS STATEMENT 
 
On the Demonstrations in IDP Camps in Darfur 
 
The Special Representative of the Chairperson of the 
African Union Commission in the Sudan, Ambassador Baba 
Gana Kingibe expresses deep shock and sadness over the 
lynching to death of an AU Language Assistant, following 
an attack against an AU Civilian Police Station by 
internally displaced persons in their Camp at Kalma in 
south Darfur.  The incident, which seemed to have been 
orchestrated to coincide with the visit of Mr. Jan 
Egeland, UN Under Secretary General for Humanitarian 
Affairs, who was himself under threat of physical harm, 
took place on 8th May 2006. 
 
The Special Representative and indeed the entire 
leadership of the African Union are deeply concerned 
about the spate of violent demonstrations by the IDPs in 
Darfur, particularly the ones that took place in Kalma 
and Hassahissa where, in addition to human casualties, a 
number of AMIS vehicles and other properties were either 
burnt, damaged or vandalized. 
 
While recognizing the immeasurable hardship daily 
experienced by the IDPs, particularly their frustration 
and anger in the face of dwindling humanitarian 
assistance, the kind of lawlessness and destructiveness 
the IDPs exhibited against the very people that are 
working hard to alleviate their suffering and plight 
cannot be justified.  These developments, coupled with 
recent reports of violent clashes between the parties to 
the conflict as well as the rampage by the Janjaweed in 
Labado where no less than ten civilians were killed and 
thirty three (33) injured, could undermine the commitment 
of the vast majority of the people of Darfur to the peace 
process.  It could also undermine the supportive efforts 
by the international community at this critical time as 
we plan the implementation of the Darfur peace agreement. 
 
The Special Representative strongly condemns these 
regrettable acts and requests the Umdahs and other local 
authorities as well as the parties who are now committed 
to peace to assume their responsibility and re-establish 
law and order to allow humanitarian workers and the AMIS 
to continue to render assistance to the needy.  All 
concerned should exercise restraint and desist from all 
acts of provocation in the interest of lasting peace in 
Darfur. 
 
On behalf of the African Union Commission and the entire 
staff of AMIS, the Special Representative wishes to 
express his heartfelt condolences to the family of the 
late AMIS Language Assistant Ahmed Defala and prays Allah 
(SWT) to grant his soul peaceful repose. 
 
Khartoum, 10 May 2006
