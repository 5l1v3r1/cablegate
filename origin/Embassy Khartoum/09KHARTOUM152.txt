¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  UNAMID reported that the GOS had "moved in and 
taken control" of Muhajarriya as of 15:40 on February 4.  Sudan 
National Radio made a similar announcement late the same day. 
Although the GOS appears to have reduced the number of aerial 
bombings compared to February 3, Sudanese Armed Forces reportedly 
dropped at least 18 bombs early in the morning of February 4. 
UNAMID reported that the GOS again blocked an assessment mission to 
the area on February 4 citing security risks, an apparent SOFA 
violation though UNAMID has not yet called the GOS out on this 
publicly (in addition to complaining to MFA about the SOFA violation 
yesterday, Embassy passed on the same complaint to Sudanese 
Intelligence and NCP officials).  OFDA-funded partner Solidarites 
reported that the GOS has ordered the organization to stop food 
distribution near Muhajarriya; it appears that at least 5000 IDPs 
near UNAMID's Team Site (TS) are living off of previously 
distributed WFP rations.  USAID partners also reported that the GOS 
has instituted new stringent rules over fuel distribution in South 
Darfur.  Although the directive was likely intended to cut off JEM's 
supplies, this has already affected the delivery of humanitarian 
services throughout the region.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  UNAMID's JMAC (Joint Mission Analysis Center) told poloff that 
that the GOS had "moved in and taken control" of Muhajarriya as of 
15:40 on February 4 (Sudan National Radio made a similar 
announcement late the same day). A bitter Minni Minnawi confirmed to 
CDA Fernandez that GOS now controlled Muhajarriya, a town he had 
held for the past four years until JEM briefly took it 20 days ago. 
The JMAC officer stated that the Justice and Equality Movement had 
left Muhajarriya and that UNAMID was not aware of their current 
location.  (Note:  One separate UNAMID report indicated that UNAMID 
has received other reporting stating that JEM is currently at least 
50 km outside Muhajarriya. End Note.)  UNAMID Sector South Commander 
Brigadier General F.E. Eze told poloff earlier in the day that 
although the level of bombing had dropped off throughout the day of 
February 4, SAF planes dropped 18 bombs starting at 2:00 am February 
4 in the rural area stretching between Muhajarriya and Labado (but 
not in either town). The scope of the damage inflicted or number of 
casualties is not yet known, he said. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) UNAMID reports and conversations with UNDSS based in Nyala 
and El-Fasher also revealed that there was less aerial bombing on 
February 4 than February 3.  One UNDSS contact in Nyala stated that 
Muhajarriya "has calmed down."   Since then no airstrikes or 
overflights have occurred over Muhajarriya, he said. He further 
stated that in the course of yesterday's bombings, no bombs were 
dropped on Muhajarriya town. They were dropped much further away, he 
said, though apparently a house was bombed inadvertently in a 
deserted area. This source noted that it is impossible to determine 
the number of casualties at this point. 
 
POSSIBLE SOFA VIOLATION AND LIMITED AIRPORTS ACCESS

¶4.  (SBU)  Although the Nyala airport is open, UNAMID and INGO 
sources all stated that access has been reduced and that the GOS had 
blocked another UNAMID flights.  One senior UNAMID official 
described the GOS interference as "part of the Government's ongoing 
violation of the Status of Forces Agreement."  Other sources stated 
that the Government has allowed large planes to land and take off 
while helicopters and small plans continue to be canceled.  Although 
the reason for this restriction is not clear, some observers believe 
that the GOS wants to restrict smaller planes that fly at a lower 
elevation and are therefore able to observe GOS and rebel movement 
positions. 
 
SOLIDARITES ORDERED TO STOP WORK IN MUHAJARRIYA 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶5.  (SBU)  USAID officers learned on February 4 that OFDA funded 
partner Solidarites was informed to stop food distribution in 
Muhajarriya.  According to these sources, the GOS's Humanitarian 
Affairs Commission (HAC) told this organization that once the 
bombing stops they can resume food distribution.  These sources 
stated that this may be impossible, as HAC also requested that 
Solidarites remove all their assets from Muhajarriya and return them 
to Nyala.  USAID partners reported that there are now at least 5,000 
IDPS surrounding the UNAMID team site in Muhajarriya, who are for 
now are surviving on rations distributed earlier (see below).  UNHCR 
also reported that IDPs are arriving in North Darfur "by the 
truckload" from South Darfur. SLM officials noted that some are 
headed to Zamzam IDP camp outside of El Fasher, a Zaghawa stronghold 
controlled by SLM/MM. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  WFP contacts also told USAIDoff on February 4 that 
regular food distributions are not taking place in Muhajarriya.

This is unfortunate, noted this source, since Solidarites' local 
staff are still on the ground in Muhajariya, WFP has ample food in 
the area, and under normal conditions Solidarites' would be able to 
distribute the normal 15-day ration very quickly.  This source 
stated that IDPs are afraid to visit the distribution center, and 
that WFP was still formulating a plan for providing these 
individuals with food and other assistance.  (Note:  OFDA-funded 
partner Solidarites was able to undertake limited food distributions 
prior to the bombings.  It is assumed that these food distributions 
made prior to the bombings are what IDPs are currently surviving on. 
End Note.)  Also, unconfirmed reports indicate that MSF/Holland 
local staff remain in Muhajariya providing limited health services. 
Solidarites reported to OFDA that there are three boreholes located 
near the team site that is providing limited access to water for the 
IDP's.  Latest reports from Solidarites indicate that the number of 
IDPs at the UNAMID team site has risen to 2000 households or 
approximately 10,000 people. 
 
NEW FUEL RESTRICTIONS 
- - - - - - - - -- - - 
¶7.  (SBU)  USAID partners also reported that the GOS has instituted 
new stringent rules over fuel distribution in South Darfur.  INGO 
and UN sourcse told USAID officers that the Sudanese authorities 
have instituted a new policy which only allows vehicles' tanks, and 
not jerry cans or other vessels, to be filled.  Additionally, the 
United Nations Joint Logistics Center in South Darfur (UNJLC) noted 
that one of their own fuel convoys in El Fasher has been waiting for 
GOS approval for the trip to South Darfur, and that as a result the 
UNJLC is running low on food.  Observers from several INGOs believe 
that the Government may be attempting to reduce the possibility of 
JEM refueling its vehicles as it flees.  This shortage has already 
started to impact gas-powered water pumps.  This has reduced water 
accessibility in at least three different INGO locations in South 
Darfur. 
 
UNAMID-GOS RELATIONS 
- - - - - - - - - - 
¶8.  (SBU) Most Sudanese daily newspapers also prominently featured 
statements from the Sudanese Armed Forces on February 4.  "Al-Rai 
Al-Aam," ran the headline, "SAF calls upon UNAMID to pull out from 
Muhajarriya within 24 Hours while, UNAMID affirms that a withdrawal 
is impossible."   UNDSS stated that UNAMID, even after Secretary 
General Ban Ki-Moon's decision to remain in Muhajarriya, continue to 
discuss an evacuation from Muhajarriya.  UNAMID's Senior leadership, 
including Joint Special Representative Adada, Deputy Force Commander 
Karenzi, and Political Chief Abdul Muhammad all traveled to Ndjamena 
on February 4 to meet with Khalil Ibrahim. 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - - 
¶9.  (SBU)  As JEM has left Muhajarriya, it is logical that the 
Government would reduce its aerial bombing and that it would move 
into the area.  The restrictions on both UNAMID and INGOs should be 
immediately lifted as the violence subsides in Muhajarriya.  To date 
the UN and NGO have not been granted access to the most troubled 
areas of South Darfur to assess the humanitarian conditions for the 
IDPs in Muhajariya and at the UNAMID team site.  The international 
community must continue pushing the government for a humanitarian 
access and a demilitarized corridor to gain access to the affected 
population.  Post will continue to press the regime on these points 
but additional statements from the Department and senior US 
officials would help achieve this goal. JEM's misadventure has now 
resulted in two new Darfur towns - Muhajarriya and Gereida - falling 
into the Sudanese Government's ruthless hands for the first time in 
years.
