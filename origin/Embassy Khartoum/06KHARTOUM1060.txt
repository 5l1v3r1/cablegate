SUBJECT:  Sudan: Kosti Wharf Update 
 
 
¶1.  On April 17, 2006, a USAID IDP advisor visited Kosti, 
White Nile State, to monitor progress of IDP returns 
through the Kosti wharf with USAID implementing-partner 
Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA).  At the 
time of the visit, ADRA estimated that the Kosti wharf 
was operating at half capacity with roughly 400-450 
travelers awaiting transportation by barge to Juba or 
Malakal.  The River Transport Corporation (RTC) has not 
yet published a schedule for barge transport, a factor 
which is preventing travelers from IDP camps and squatter 
areas in Khartoum from planning onward movement into 
Southern Sudan.  ADRA is sensitizing returnee populations 
on the situation at the wharf through both a 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) public 
information campaign targeting IDP camps surrounding 
Khartoum and by sending delegates to major originating 
areas in White Nile State, including Asalaya.  The 
successful dissemination of information regarding the 
situation at Kosti wharf has helped to minimize pressure 
on the wharf's limited capacity. 
 
¶2.  RTC finally received 32 barge-pusher engines that 
were stalled for several weeks in Port Sudan while 
awaiting customs clearance.  The German team of 
technicians tasked with rehabilitating the pusher engines 
has arrived in Kosti and begun working to install the 
engines.  Additionally, the Dutch government has 
partnered with RTC to fund the construction of four new 
barges.  The RTC is also working to build a barge 
assembly plant at a site in Kosti. 
 
¶3.  The IOM-funded ADRA returns monitoring and tracking 
system is functioning well.  ADRA currently employs 24 
enumerators to track IDP returns through 12 way stations, 
covering both road and river transport.  In March, ADRA 
counted 7824 returns, more than double the  3689 people 
who transited through Kosti to return south in February. 
 
¶4.  A recent U.N. World Food Program (WFP) survey 
revealed that White Nile State is experiencing severe 
food insecurity.  WFP continues to distribute food 
commodities to Kosti's IDP population on a quarterly 
basis following the phase-out of ADRA's supplementary 
feeding program, which was supported by both USAID's 
Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and 
Office of Food For Peace (FFP).  WFP plans to provide a 
general food ration to 41,500 IDPs in Kosti's four IDP 
camps from April through July.  WFP will also continue to 
support local supplementary and therapeutic feeding 
programs in the Kosti and Rebek hospitals.
