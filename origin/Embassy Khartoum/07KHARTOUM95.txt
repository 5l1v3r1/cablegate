¶1. (U) President Bashir stated that Sudan continues to support 
Somalia, seeks to continue hosting talks among Somali parties, and 
offers training for Somali army and police units.  His remarks, made 
during the January 20-22 visit to Khartoum of Somali Prime Minister 
Ali Mohammed Gedi, also pledged support to Somalia in education, 
services and capacity building, as well as the re-opening of the 
Sudanese embassy in Mogadishu.  (Note: Somalia retains a small 
mission in Khartoum, staffed by a Charge d'Affaires who represents 
the Transitional Federal Government.  End note.) 
 
¶2. (U) The same account, from the Sudan News Agency, states that 
State Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Karti said that the Somali 
government had requested that Sudan send forces to train the Somali 
army, police, and security forces, as well as the civil 
administration.  He said that any foreign forces that arrive in 
Somalia will be targeted by the opposition and those who seek 
instability.  Ali Karti also said that the Somali government had 
agreed for Sudan to continue its mediation role in the resumption of 
the Somali talks (reftels). 
 
¶3. (U) According to a translation of a broadcast of Omdurman Sudan 
Television in Arabic on January 21, National Assembly Speaker Ahmad 
Ibrahim al-Tahir appealed to Arab League states and countries in the 
region to support efforts to restore stability to Somalia. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  Sudan clearly relished its role as host and 
facilitator for three rounds of Somali talks over the past year in 
its capacity as Arab League Chair.  President Bashir's interest in 
continued dealings with Somali issues may reflect his interest in 
gaining the African Union Chairmanship at the January 29-30 Summit 
in Addis Ababa, a prize that eluded his grasp during the January 
2006 AU Summit in Khartoum.  End comment.
