¶1.  The Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) Ministry of Agriculture 
(MoA) has confirmed several cases of poultry infected with Avian 
Influenza (H5N1) in Juba.  There are no reports of Avian Influenza 
in the human population, however, and no commercial poultry 
operations in the region.  The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) physician responsible for the HIV/AIDS program in 
Juba is now working with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the 
UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to help both the MoA and 
the Ministry of Health (MoH) establish a task force to perform a 
survey, monitor the spread of the disease, and develop an action 
plan. 
 
¶2.  After initial slowness on the part of the GoSS, the ministries 
now seem more willing to take action, but the CDC remains concerned 
that the GoSS is not taking the immediate steps necessary to prevent 
a wider outbreak.  The UN and the Consulate General are now 
coordinating their response to provide suppot to the government. 
 
¶3.  Avian Influenza was confirmed in three chickens at one household 
in Juba on August 4.  Several other households have reported recent 
or ongoing chicken and duck deaths.  The MoA failed to report these 
cases of Avian Influenza to the MoH until last week.  The CDC was 
notified on September 8 and had immediately begun contingency 
planning to support the Government's response.  There is no current 
understanding of the extent to which the disease has spread, and 
while no human cases have yet been identified, and are unlikely, 
such cannot be ruled out due to the lack of an effective 
surveillance system. 
 
¶4.  Note:  USAID will report septel regarding other activities 
involving outreach efforts and technical assistance provided to the 
GoSS for its response to Avian Influenza, which complement those 
furnished at the GNU level.  End Note.
