SUBJECT:  Three Sudanese Gov't Workers Killed in Zalingei IDP Camp 
 
¶1. (SBU) On July 20, IDPs in Hassa Hissa internally displaced 
persons (IDP) camp in Zalingei (Sector 7) beat to death three 
government workers (Note:  press coverage often referred to them as 
aid or humanitarian workers.  End note.)  The IDPs suspected 
Sudanese government Water and Environmental Sanitation (WES) 
employees of poisoning water sources; the workers were actually 
conducting routine checks of chlorination levels of the water.  A 
total of 15 WES, UNICEF, and INGO staff present were present at the 
time.  Embassy Pol/Econ local staff reported press accounts offering 
a slightly different version of the story, wherein the employees 
were suspected of tampering with water supplies, and were killed 
after they refused to drink the water to demonstrate that it was 
safe.  Distrust of government employees associated with local NGOs 
appears to underlie the violence; tensions remain high within the 
camp.  The United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) has suspended aid 
activities in Hassa Hissa, but has announced its readiness to resume 
services once security conditions permit. 
 
¶2. (U) On July 25, the Office of the Spokesperson of UNMIS released 
a statement by Special Representative Pronk that condemned the 
killings and noted the effective partnership between the Water and 
Environment Sanitation agency and UNICEF in providing safe drinking 
water to conflict-affected persons in Darfur. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In another incident, on July 22, IDPs in Kamasa Dagai IDP 
camp killed a teacher who was suspected of trying to poison a child 
with a vaccine.  Also on July 22, a government police officer was 
beaten to death by IDPs in Hamadiya camp.  Currently, there are no 
NGOs operational in any of these three Zalingei-area camps.  UNICEF 
has reported the government may withhdraw all WES staff from areas 
controlled by non-signatories to the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA).
