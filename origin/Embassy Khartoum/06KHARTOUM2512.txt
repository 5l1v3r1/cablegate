Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. The humanitarian situation in Sudan continues to warrant U.S. 
Government (USG) assistance to meet the emergency requirements of 
conflict-affected civilian populations throughout the country.  USG 
assistance in Sudan saves lives and mitigates the economic impact of 
conflict on livelihoods, fostering economic recovery as the country 
transitions from more than two decades of civil war.  The provision 
of humanitarian and transitional assistance is in the foreign policy 
interest of the USG, and the Sudanese government will continue to 
accept USG assistance as the humanitarian situation is beyond local 
capacity to manage.  Charge d'affaires Hume therefore re-declares 
the complex emergency in Sudan. End Summary.

Darfur 
------ 
 
¶2. Political developments in Sudan during early 2006 have created 
opportunities for USG assistance to support and consolidate the 
Sudanese peace, facilitate reconciliation of formerly warring 
parties, and move the country more firmly onto a path towards 
democratic governance and sustainable economic development.  On May 
5, the Government of National Unity (GNU) and the Sudan Liberation 
Movement faction lead by Minni Minawi signed the Darfur Peace 
Agreement (DPA) establishing a foundation for building peace in the 
three states of Darfur.  However, the road to peace has been 
hindered by renewed fighting, displacement, and insecurity, all of 
which affect the delivery of humanitarian assistance and create 
additional needs among an already vulnerable population. 
 
¶3. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (OCHA), approximately 1.9 million people are internally 
displaced and more than 220,000 people have fled across the border 
into neighboring Chad, out of an estimated population of 6.5 million 
in Darfur. 
 
¶4. In response to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, USAID deployed 
a Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) in April 2004.  In 
October 2005, the USAID/DART transitioned to the USAID Darfur Field 
Office (USAID/DFO).  USAID/DFO team members are deployed to field 
offices in El Fasher and Nyala, as well as in Khartoum.  The 
USAID/DFO supports and coordinates the USG response in the areas of 
food security, agriculture, health, water and sanitation, shelter, 
nutrition, protection, and livelihoods, as well as program strategy 
and implementation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and UN 
agencies. 
 
¶5. USAID-funded UN and NGO partner programs reach nearly all of the 
estimated 1.9 million internally displaced persons (IDPs).  The 
interventions range from meeting basic needs such as shelter, water, 
and healthcare, to providing materials and supplies for sustenance 
and livelihoods. 
 
¶6. In FY 2007, interventions funded by USAID's Office of U.S. 
Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) interventions will continue 
to stabilize the environment through advocacy for more access, 
protection, and security for affected populations in Darfur. 
USAID/OFDA aims to maintain basic services in areas of IDP 
concentration, while promoting livelihoods via a measured economic 
recovery process.  Security conditions permitting, USAID/OFDA will 
prepare for spontaneous returns to villages of origin.  USAID/OFDA 
will continue to address crosscutting issues, such as capacity 
building, conflict sensitivity, environmental impact, social 
context, livelihoods, and protection, in all response activities. 
Additionally, relief and recovery programs aim at supporting the DPA 
by providing tangible peace dividends to conflict-affected 
communities.

Southern Sudan

¶7. The signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) on January 
9, 2005, between the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's 
Liberation Movement (SPLM) ushered in an era of transition and 
recovery for Southern Sudan.  However, the Government of Southern 
Sudan's (GOSS) capacity to respond to humanitarian needs remains 
limited and new long-term funding mechanisms are slow to commence. 
Expectations are high among Southern Sudanese that the new GOSS will 
 
KHARTOUM 00002512  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
deliver on critical services, economic development, and integration 
of returning IDPs and refugees.  High visibility programs providing 
basic services, such as water, sanitation, health, and 
infrastructure rehabilitation are needed to increase stability and 
support the fragile CPA. 
 
¶8. The UN estimates that nearly five hundred thousand displaced 
persons returned from northern urban centers to Southern Sudan 
during 2005 and 2006, taxing scarce resources and weak 
infrastructure.  In FY 2007, in keeping with the mandate to save 
lives and reduce suffering, USAID/OFDA will focus on areas with 
highest IDP returns and humanitarian need, and specifically target 
areas at greatest risk of conflict and violence.  USAID/OFDA 
anticipates the largest program sector will continue to be emergency 
primary healthcare, because neither GOSS coffers nor new long-term 
funding mechanisms will provide significant resources in the 
short-term.  IDP returns are expected to stress the already fragile 
and in some cases non-existent water, sanitation, and health 
infrastructure in communities where these groups settle.  Food 
security is expected to be the second major program sector for 
USAID/OFDA, aiming to reduce the need for expensive food aid, 
promote livelihoods, and stimulate local markets.

USAID/OFDA Assistance to Sudan in FY 2006 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶15. In FY 2006, USAID/OFDA provided for the immediate humanitarian 
needs in Sudan while simultaneously transitioning to longer-term 
development activities.  USAID/OFDA provided basic humanitarian 
services in conflict-affected areas of Sudan, particularly in the 
area of IDP returns, and responded to the ongoing humanitarian 
emergency in Darfur.  The overall package of emergency assistance 
consisted of contributions from USAID/OFDA, USAID's Office of Food 
For Peace (USAID/FFP), and USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives 
(USAID/OTI). 
 
¶16. In FY 2006, USAID/OFDA awarded more than $69 million to 28 NGO 
and UN partners for emergency programs in non-Darfur Sudan in the 
sectors of health, food security and agriculture, water and 
sanitation, income generation, nutrition, protection, capacity 
building, and coordination. In Darfur, USAID/OFDA provided more than 
$104 million in FY 2006 to 28 NGO and UN partners for multi-sector 
interventions to assist IDPs and vulnerable populations.  USAID/OFDA 
also supported spontaneous returns of IDPs to their places of 
origin.

Disaster Re-declaration in Sudan 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶19. In light of the above, Charge d'affaires Hume re-declares 
existence of a complex humanitarian disaster and requests continued 
support from USAID/OFDA to meet humanitarian needs and facilitate 
the transition to peace and sustainable development.
