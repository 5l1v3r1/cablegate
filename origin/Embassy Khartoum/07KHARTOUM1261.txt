¶1. (SBU) Summary: In an August 9-10 visit to the northern town of 
Shendi in River Nile State, and also birthplace of Sudanese 
President Omar Al-Bashir, CDA Fernandez met with the newly-appointed 
commissioner, presented books to the vice chancellor of Shendi 
University, and toured area farms and textile factories. CDA used 
his trip to convey the message that the United States is committed 
to deepening its understanding of -- and interaction -- with all of 
Sudan, and that its interests extended beyond the South and Darfur. 
USAID, POL and RSO also accompanied on the visit. End summary.

SHENDI TRIP BOTH SYMBOLIC, SUBSTANTIVE 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Meeting with the new commissioner of Shendi, Jaafar Benaga 
El-Tayib, CDA told him that the US recognized the need to have a 
complete picture of Sudan, a picture too often dominated by its 
interests in the South and in Darfur. The commissioner encouraged 
this approach and welcomed CDA's visit to Shendi, describing the 
town as a microcosm of Sudanese society and politics. "It's a model 
for the country," he said, citing its mixed religious population and 
lack of security concerns (it is also the home town of President 
Al-Bashir and much of the NCP elite). CDA used the meeting as an 
opportunity to advocate the smooth implementation of UNSCR 1769 and 
to explain the considerable interest the American people took in the 
issue of Darfur. CDA likened it to the Sudanese people's concern for 
Palestinians; both issues carried symbolic heft in the respective 
public opinions, even though they took place outside national 
boundaries. (Note: At dinner later in the evening, the commissioner 
again welcomed CDA's visit, praising it as a step in the right 
direction for improved mutual understanding and a true indicator of 
US interest in the whole of Sudan. End note.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a subsequent visit to Shendi University, CDA presented 
Vice Chancellor Dr. Abdel Gafar Ali Adam with a set of books for the 
university's admittedly paltry library (although Shendi University's 
infrastructure is far better than that found in most other rural 
universities, especially in the South). Touring the university, CDA 
took the opportunity to discuss future scholarship and training 
possibilities. CDA also visited a textiles factory and two area 
farms, where intensive mango, citrus and banana cultivation was 
underway. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
JUST LIKE ONE OF US, ACCORDING TO LOCAL PRESS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) CDA's trip was the first visit to Shendi by an American 
official in recent memory (likely the first by any foreign 
representative). The commissioner, university officials and area 
farmers were overwhelmingly enthusiastic about the visit, and 
stressed the importance of continued outreach to other areas of the 
country. The press was also not immune to the perceived unorthodoxy 
of this type of "highway diplomacy;" on August 12, Arabic daily 
Akhbar al-Yawm, referring to CDA's recent visit to the NCP Shura 
Council as well as his Shendi trip, ran the following headline: "The 
American Charge d'Affaires Enters the National Congress, Visits 
Shendi and Stays at the Kawther Hotel!"  The columnist went on to 
note with amazement that the CDA visited Shendi without a security 
detail, did not request special accommodations (preferring to 
overnight in one of Shendi's "three-star" hotels), and thought 
nothing of making the two-hour trip to Shendi by car.
