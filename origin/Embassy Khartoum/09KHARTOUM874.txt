This is an action request. 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary.  Ugandan Ambassador Betty Akech Okullou 
called on Charge July 28 to discuss the fate of a Ugandan 
national abducted a month ago in Darfur (reftel).  Okullou 
said she had been consulting closely with the Irish, who are 
also working to free an Irish national abducted at the same 
time, but she confided that she was worried by the length of 
the captivity and the lack of information from the NISS.  She 
said that she knew that the US has "good sources" and 
requested that the embassy pass along any useful information 
that we might see.  Charge told her what we know about the 
case to date, which is not a great deal new, and offered to 
help as possible.  Okullou also commented briefly on the GOU 
position on the ICC indictment against President Bashir in 
the context of the GOU's own ICC case brought against the 
Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) Ambassador Okullou informed the Charge that there is 
increasing concern in Kampala over the fate of the Ugandan 
national seized by kidnappers almost a month ago from the 
Irish NGO GOAL office in Kutum, along with an Irish 
colleague.  She confirmed that the kidnappers are now 
requesting less than a million dollars US but noted that 
there had been no progress toward resolving the case. 
Okullou said she had dispatched one of her staff to 
coordinate with an Irish police/military team in Darfur and 
was in touch with Irish Ambassador Corr, who had twice come 
to Khartoum from Cairo to meet with GOS officials.  Okullou 
said that her embassy intelligence liaison officer was in 
contact with NISS but complained that the flow of information 
had been scant.  She did not know exactly where the detainees 
were presently located and wondered if bilateral politics 
might be involved.  Okullou continued that she knew the US 
has good sources of information and would appreciate anything 
we might be able to share. 
 
¶3.  (C) Charge replied that he has seen a limited amount on 
the case but to date had detected no political motivation on 
the Sudanese side.  The kidnappers were reportedly part of an 
Arab militia group of some sort; it appeared that the 
motivation for the kidnappings appeared monetary rather than 
political.  He said that we had offered the UN and the Irish 
to help in any way we could, and assured her that the same 
was true for Uganda.  He cautioned that payment of a ransom 
to the kidnappers, whoever they turn out to be, risked 
triggering an open season on humanitarian workers in Darfur, 
further complicating humanitarian outreach efforts there. 
 
¶4.  (C) Okullou said that relations between Kampala and 
Khartoum are presently delicate due to the ICC indictment of 
President Bashir.  Uganda had been forced into a balancing 
act between its commitment as an ICC signatory and its desire 
to respect the AU position on the indictment to the extent 
possible.  Uganda had brought one of the very first cases to 
the ICC, the request to indict Joseph Kony and his LRA 
lieutenants, and had a strategic interest in seeing the ICC 
succeed.  It was not an easy moment to be Ugandan Ambassador 
in Khartoum, she sighed, and especially a female one. 
 
¶5.  (C) Action request.  We have seen limited information on 
the abduction case but request that anything pertinent we can 
share be passed along, including sanitized information from 
intelligence channels.
