REF: KHARTOUM 266, KHARTOUM 269 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  On February 25, Dr. Tahir Adam, the Speaker of 
the Legislative Council of the Justice Equality Movement (JEM), told 
econoff by satellite phone t$`estroyed by JEM 
within one week. SAF, however, publicly denied losing any aircraft 
to rebel fire. Adam also gave information regarding SAF troop 
movements and added that JEM has unsuccessfully attempted to contact 
the Chinese Special Envoy and the U.S.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Adam claimed that SAF troops, supported by janjaweed, 
continue to attack JEM forces in West Darfur.  Adam stated that 
Sirba, Abu Siraj, and Silea had been completely burned and destroyed 
and that SAF continued to attack other areas near El-Geneina and 
Jebel Moun.  "There has been extensive displacement of people from 
the area with people fleeing to Chad and other surrounding areas," 
he said. 
 
JEM ALLEGEDLY DOWNS 3 HELICOPTERS 
--------------------------------- 
¶3.  (SBU) Adam also alleged that on February 24, government forces 
attacked JEM near Jebel Moun with seven heavy artillery, two Antonov 
airplanes, and one helicopter.  According to Adam, JEM forces 
delivered a direct hit with its own artillery to a SAF helicopter 
near Kundube (15 kilometers north of Al-Geneina) resulting in its 
eventual crash.  (Note:  Local press, such as Al-Sudani, reported on 
February 25 that a SAF helicopter crashed north of El-Geneina, but 
SAF attributed the loss to technical failure, rather than a JEM 
attack.  The reports said that the helicopter made an emergency 
landing after which it burst into flames.  One SAF spokesman is 
noted as asking, "How can we receive artillery from an area that we 
totally control?"  End Note.)  Adam claimed that this is the third 
SAF helicopter downed by JEM forces within one week. However, UNAMID 
has not verified JEM's claims, and has issued instructions to its 
own field officers to carefully verify any rebel claims to military 
successes. 
 
SAF BUILDUP, INCLUDING TANKS 
---------------------------- 
¶4.  (SBU) Adam said that the SAF troop buildup continues, specifying 
that four days ago, SAF forces were deployed to the city of Bolo, 
northwest of Al-Fasher.  According to Adam, SAF now has 125 land 
cruiser vehicles, 120 military vehicles mounted with heavy weapons, 
15 fuel tankers, and 25 tanks near Bolo.  Adam stated, "This is the 
first time that the Sudanese Army is trying to use tanks against 
us."  Adam also claimed that SAF shelling of the Jebel Moun area 
continues.  According to Adam, on February 24, SAF forces killed 
three JEM soldiers (including one commander) and 27 civilians (20 
men and 7 women) in the town of Kopt near Jebel Moun. 
 
CONTACTING CHINA AND THE U.S. 
----------------------------- 
¶5.  (SBU) According to Adam, JEM representatives in London have 
tried numerous times to meet the Chinese.   "We were always 
unsuccessful and we have given up trying to engage them," said Adam. 
 He also stated that on November 27, 2007 JEM representatives 
delivered a letter to the U.S. Embassy in London putting forth their 
priorities and requesting a meeting with Embassy officials. 
According to Adam, JEM will continue to seek more interaction with 
the U.S. as, "We look with high regard at the American authorities 
and we appreciate all the efforts by the Americans.  The U.S. has 
been the strongest supporQr of the people of Darfur." 
 
¶6.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The Sudanese Armed Forces has a track record of 
attributing helicopter crashes to "mechanical problems."  Although 
the helicopter destroyed on February 24 was most likely shot down by 
rebels, we should treat all of JEM's claims with healthy skepticism. 
 JEM has repeatedly exaggerated and distorted facts for its own 
self-promotion and bears major responsibility in provoking this 
government offensive after JEM attacked and seize several 
lightly-defended Darfur towns.  JEM's claim of downing two other 
helicopters earlier in the week has not been independently verified, 
nor has the SAF made any mention of the loss of additional assets. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Comment continued:  Adam displayed a strong command of 
detail, a high level of English proficiency, and an unexpected 
amount of sophistication for one of Darfur's rebels in the field. 
Adam is likely one of the core individuals contributing to JEM's 
strategic communication program, one of the strongest of any Darfur 
rebel group, though one that also uses the media to announce 
exaggerated claims, boast of its military prowess, bring about 
disproportionate Government counter-attacks and ultimately sow 
violence and chaos to the detriment of Darfur's innocent civilians. 
END COMMENT.

¶8.  (U)  BIO NOTE:  Dr. Tahir Adam is the Speaker of the Legislative 
Council of the Justice and Equality Movement.  He is from An-Nahud 
in North Kordofan, and claims to be close friends with other JEM 
leaders from the area, such as Ibrahim Abu Rannat.  Adam later 
studied at Khartoum University and has published a number of 
articles (such as "JEM's Vision for a New Sudan") on websites such 
as sudantribune.com and sudaneseonline.com.
