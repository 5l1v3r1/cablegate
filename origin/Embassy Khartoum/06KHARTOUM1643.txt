SUBJECT:  UGANDA-LRA MEDIATION INITIATIVE INCHES FORWARD 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) Vice 
President Riek Machar will return from Maridi on July 12, where he 
traveled to meet with Lord's Resistance Army leaders.  Ugandan 
Consulate officials say that the Ugandan delegation is prepared to 
travel as soon as Machar returns and confirms mutually acceptable 
dates; we do not expect this to occur before next week.  The Swiss 
Government is providing funding in support of the mediation 
initiative.  End summary.

Coaxing Kony

¶2.  (SBU) GoSS Ministry of Regional Affairs officials informed CG 
Juba that VP Machar had traveled to Maridi on July 10 to meet with 
"senior LRA officials" in an attempt to coax Joseph Kony into 
sending Vincent Otti to Juba to join the LRA delegation that has 
been here for nearly a month.  The GoSS believes that the current 
composition of the delegation is too expatriate and too civilian to 
be able to take binding decisions for the LRA.  Machar is scheduled 
to return to Juba on July 12.  It is not clear if he succeeded in 
convincing Kony to upgrade his representation here.

Ugandan Delegation Ready to Travel 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Official at the Ugandan Consulate told CG that Uganda has 
named its full delegation, which is prepared to travel to Juba. 
There is no departure schedule at this time:  the Ugandans are 
waiting to consult with Machar upon his return to discuss dates 
before sending the GOU team.  The consular officials did not believe 
that this would happen before the end of the current week.  They 
could not confirm GoSS claims that there would be a public opening 
ceremony, and said that the agenda and ground rules for the talks 
had not been set.  These would be subject to discussion following 
the arrival of the Ugandan delegation.

Switzerland Provides Support 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) A Swiss diplomat based in Khartoum called on CG July 11 to 
discuss the GOU-LRA mediation.  The diplomat said that Machar had 
sent a letter to the Swiss Foreign Ministry requesting expertise and 
financial and logistical support of the mediation initiative.  In 
response, the Swiss Government had agreed to provide the requested 
support.  The diplomat had come with a Letter of Intent to be signed 
with the GoSS Ministry of Regional Affairs.  The letter offers in 
broad-brush strokes support of the GoSS initiative as well as an 
offer to help the GoSS maintain the dialogue with the International 
Criminal Court.  The only specific requested of the GoSS is adequate 
office space and consideration of provision of adequate housing and 
transport to the Swiss experts on the ground supporting the talks.
