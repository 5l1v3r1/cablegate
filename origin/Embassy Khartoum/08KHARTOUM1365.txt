¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On September 4, leaders of the Fur Shura Council 
(FSC) told CDA Fernandez that they are suspicious of any NCP-led 
investigation into the Kalma camp attack.  CDA Fernandez expressed 
his condolences for those killed in the Kalma camp attack, while FSC 
representatives emphasized the need for unity among Darfur's many 
ethnic groups, political parties, and rebel movements.  SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The following members of the Fur Shura Council (FSC) 
visited CDA Fernandez at the U.S. Embassy on September 4: 
 
- Dr. Idris Yousif, General Secretary of the FSC, Fur 
- Mr. Amin Mahmud, Deputy S.G., Fur 
- Dr. Nasreldin Abdul Bari, Fur 
- Mr. Gaffar Ibrahim, Dajo 
- Mr. Tageldin Sideiq, Birgid 
- Mr. Ibrahim M. Adam, Tunjur 
 
(Note:  The FSC includes some representatives of some tribes that 
have been historically very close to the Fur such as the Tunjur, 
Birgid and Dajo.  End Note) Many of Sudan's larger tribes have these 
"consultative" or Shura Councils to provide a voice for the tribe in 
the capital and press their views. The Fur Shura Council has 
generally been close to the views of SLM leader Abdul Wahid Nur, 
although not in lock-step with him. 
 
¶3. (SBU) CDA Fernandez opened offering his sympathy and condolences 
for those killed in the August 25 attack on the Kalma internally 
displaced persons (IDP) camp. Most of the victims came from the Fur, 
Darfur's largest tribe, who have borne the brunt of regime attacks 
over the past five years in the region named after them.  The CDA 
described the attack as a "crime" and "massacre" and that he 
unequivocally used these terms with GoS officials the week of August 
¶31. The U.S. is looking for swift and public accountability for the 
Kalma attack. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  General Secretary of the Fur Shura Council, Idris Yousif 
thanked the CDA for the opportunity to visit the U.S. Embassy and 
said the Government of Sudan bears total responsibility for the 
attack.  "This confirms what has been said about genocide," 
emphasized Yousif. He said that they believe that the Wali of South 
Darfur and ICC indictee and State Minister of Humanitarian Affairs 
Ahmed Haroun were actually in the vicinity of Kalma as the attack 
was taking place, which discounts the theory that Khartoum was not 
involved in the local operation. Yousif said that the time for empty 
words and vague plans has ended and real action is needed by the 
GoS.  He said that civil society leaders need to help inform rebel 
movements and bring them together.  Yousif stated that there have 
been several successful civil society meetings in Dar Es Salaam, 
Khartoum, and Heidelberg, and that more of this civil society work 
is needed, especially "another independent meeting free of 
government interference in Darfur." 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Deputy Secretary General Amin Mahmud stated that although 
the GoS has formed an investigation committee into the Kalma 
massacre, he has little faith that it will bring justice to South 
Darfur.  Mahmud emphasized that the head of the investigation 
committee, Babiker Abd Al-Latif, was the chief lawyer who 
successfully prosecuted ten Fur individuals for the murder of 
"Al-Wifaq" Editor in Chief Muhammad Taha.  Mahmud emphasized that 
despite being mired with irregularities and distrust, the trial 
ended in the death sentences of this large group of Fur.  (NOTE: 
Latif is also the lead prosecutor for the ongoing murder case of 
John Granville and Abd Al-Rahman Abbas.  END NOTE.)  Mahmud also 
stated that another individual named to this committee is Adam 
Jamaa', the former mayor of Nyala, an individual allegedly known for 
his abuse and hatred of the Fur.  Mahmud noted that Jamaa' is likely 
one of the rumored 51 potential indictees for the International 
Criminal Court. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  The Bergid representative, Mr. Tageldin Sideiq emphasized 
that the Kalma camp incident has the potential to change the dynamic 
in Darfur.  He emphasized that there is growing agreement between 
rebel movement and civil society, but that the GoS continues to try 
to divide both groups.  According to Sideig, the Fur and Bergid have 
good relations, and incidents such as this will only strengthen 
their relationship.  Sideig also stated that without Ocampo's 
request for an ICC indictment, Sudan would never have appointed a 
special prosecutor devoted to Darfur.  (NOTE:  On August 5 The 
Ministry of Justice Abdel-Basit Sabdarat appointed Nimr Ibrahim 
Mohamed as the Darfur prosecutor with three assistants; Kamal 
Mahjoub Ahmed, Al-Hadi Mahjoub Makkawi and Mamoun Mekki Hamid.  END 
NOTE.) Nasr Al-Din Abd Al-Bari alleged that NCP leaders planned the 
 
KHARTOUM 00001365  002 OF 002 
 
 
camp invasion as part of a conference in Khartoum on August 20 where 
NCP leaders discussed breaking up IDP camps.  Al-Bari also stated 
that the resettlement of Arab tribes from West Africa onto lands 
inhabited by the Dajo, Fur, and Bergid is a significant problem that 
must be addressed. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Gafaar Ibrahim, a Dajo representative on the Fur council, 
emphasized that any solution for Darfur must come from the people. 
He said that tribal reconciliation will require creative solutions 
and an environment that encourages self-criticism and 
self-reflection.  Fur leader Al-Bari noted that the GoS looks at the 
ongoing presence of IDPs as a reminder of their own crimes. 
 
¶8. (SBU) All the members asked that the United States and other P-5 
members at the UNSC not sacrifice the cause of justice in Darfur in 
exchange for some, probably illusory, concessions for Darfur.  CDA 
responded that the United States is against impunity, has not 
decided how it will vote at the UNSC on an ICC deferral, but is 
looking to see real, tangible changes on the ground from the 
Sudanese Government, not more "political theater." He added that the 
U.S. has no intention of "trafficking in the misery of the people of 
Darfur" for short-term game.  Kalma was a setback in what is already 
a difficult relationship. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) The CDA then inquired about the current relationship 
between Darfur's Arab and African tribes. According to General 
Secretary Yousif, there has been a "big change" in the Arabs. 
Following inter-Arab fighting Arab leaders have realized that the 
GoS has deceived, manipulated, and exploited their tribes.  Yousif 
emphasized that Darfur's Arabs are not a monolithic group as "there 
are good Arabs and bad Arabs in Darfur."  Yousif stated that 
following the widespread arming of the Arab tribes, Darfur needs a 
major disarmament program as "weapons are all over the place." 
 
¶10.  COMMENT:  The Fur leaders repeatedly offered profuse thanks to 
the CDA for the opportunity to be heard following the traumatic 
events of Kalma.  Their suspicions of Khartoum-led investigations 
into Kalma and Darfur are justifiable, and signal that in order for 
the investigation to be credible, it must be swift, transparent and 
decisive in order to have credibility with a broad representation of 
tribes and political parties.
