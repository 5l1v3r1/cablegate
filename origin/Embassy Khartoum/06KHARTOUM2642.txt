Details of interception by US forces of Red Sea Sudanese Ferry 
 
Official sources uncovered new details about an incident 
where a Sudanese ship of Ba'abood Shipping was exposed to 
marine piracy in the Red Sea when U.S. military forces 
affiliated with the American Coalition forces intercepted the 
Sudanese vessel (Ibn Al Walid), and subjected it to major 
inspections, 35 nautical miles east of Port Sudan on its way 
from Saudi Arabia to Port Sudan.  According to sources, the 
armed soldiers boarded the ship, detained the crew, and 
conducted an examination of the workers and sailors' 
passports in addition to photographing the crew of the ship. 
The American ship detained the Sudanese vessel for four 
hours, during which time they conducted a thorough inspection 
and prevented the ship's crew from contacting the Sudanese 
authorities.  An authorized source in the Maritime Port 
Authority called the event undisguised marine piracy and 
indicated that it is forbidden to intercept a civilian vessel 
in this way, adding that the American forces deployed in the 
Red Sea have become an impediment to navigation and that a 
number of vessels from various countries have been exposed to 
similar inspections without clear and convincing 
justification.
