¶1. (SBU) Summary: Almost four months after journalist and former 
United Nations press employee Lubna Ahmed al-Hussein gained 
tremendous international attention for wearing pants in public, she 
appears determined not to allow the incident to quietly fade away. 
Despite threats and travel restrictions, she continues to pursue a 
conviction reversal and is suing a government official for 
defamation of character.  Her goal is to effect changes in Sudan's 
system of Sharia Law.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Not Willing to Let Issue Fade 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 26, Lubna Hussein told poloff of her continuing 
appeal to overturn the September 7 conviction of violating Sudanese 
criminal code article 152 (indecent dress).  Hussein served one day 
in jail after her 500SDG (approximately USD220) fine was paid, on 
her behalf and against her wishes, by the head of the pro-government 
Sudanese Journalists' Union.  Having appealed her conviction upon 
her release, she awaits a response from the judicial system. 
Hussein admitted that she hopes (and expects) to lose this appeal so 
that she can take the issue further and appeal it to the 
Constitutional Court of Sudan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ms. Hussein has also filed a defamation lawsuit against the 
Speaker of the National Legislative Assembly, Ahmed Ibrahim 
Al-Tahir.  She accused the speaker of making slanderous comments 
about her in a press interview that was published in an 
Arabic-language newspaper.  She believes the comments taint her 
reputation and negatively affect her appeal.  Ms. Hussein requested 
the lifting of the speaker's immunity in order to pursue a case 
against him; however, the request was rejected.  Hussein was 
insistent that she will continue looking for a way to pursue both 
her appeal and the defamation lawsuit.  She claimed her objective is 
to test Sudanese laws and judicial procedures until she finds 
justice even in an instance where the accused is a government 
official.  She acknowledged that her case is minor compared to other 
situations, especially in Darfur, but she believes that her efforts 
will ultimately benefit all Sudanese women. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Threatened and Denied Exit Visas 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Since the arrest of Ms. Hussein on July 3, she was denied 
an exit visa to travel outside of Sudan on two separate occasions. 
In August, prior to her trial and conviction, she was denied 
permission to travel to Lebanon. Ms. Hussein claimed her request did 
not go through the normal court process for a decision but rather 
was refused immediately by the police. (Note: Sudan customarily 
denies travel for defendants out on bond awaiting trial.  End note.) 
 A second exit visa request for travel to the United Kingdom in 
October made it all the way to the court judge for a response, but 
authorities similarly denied this request.  Hussein claimed the 
Government of Sudan (GOS) has placed her under a complete ban and 
will not allow her to travel via any means, whether by land, air or 
sea. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Although she did not appear overly concerned, Hussein 
acknowledged receiving numerous anonymous threats, including death 
and rape threats.  Some of the individuals who contacted Hussein 
have threatened further charges against her, including crimes that, 
if she were to be convicted, could result in the punishment of 
stoning, as permitted under Sharia Law. (Note: Although stoning is 
cited as a punishment for some acts in Sudan, the punishment has not 
been carried out in recent memory.  End note.)  Even though friends 
and colleagues have warned her of the dangers of challenging the 
government so directly, she does not seem daunted.  Hussein claimed 
to have refused suggestions from activist groups who believe she 
should leave Sudan. Instead, she has vowed to stay and continue her 
efforts to change the law. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment:  While GOS officials may wish to sweep this case 
under the rug and let it die quietly in the media, Hussein is 
determined to persist and keep it alive.  It is unlikely that she 
will be successful at getting immunity lifted from a high-level 
government official, but she is not afraid to push the envelope and 
force open previously-closed doors.  Through her determined efforts, 
her case continues to progress in full public view.  Aware as she is 
of the international draw of her case, she has recently signed a 
book contract with a French publisher. End Comment.
