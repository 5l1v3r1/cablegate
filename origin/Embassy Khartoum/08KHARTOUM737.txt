SUBJECT:  HEAVY FIGHTING BETWEEN SPLA AND SAF IN ABYEI 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Heavy fighting has broken out and continues 
between SPLA and SAF forces in the town of Abyei, despite UNMIS 
efforts to broker a ceasefire.  With both the NCP and SPLM 
distracted by other crises, the UN is concerned that the situation 
could deteriorate further if the fighting spreads to units located 
around the town.  The majority of the town's population has fled the 
fighting and some NGO international staff are trapped in their 
compounds by the fighting.  End summary.

¶2.  (SBU) Heavy fighting is taking place between SAF and SPLA forces 
in the disputed town of Abyei.  The UN is concerned that the already 
serious situation could easily escalate, given the near proximity of 
additional SPLA and SAF units that could enter the town and join the 
fight.  The fighting reportedly began late May 13 with an impromptu 
clash at an SPLM police post.  The circumstances of the initial 
clash remain murky at this time, but both SPLA and SAF units quickly 
became involved and the fighting continued into May 14 and 
intensified.  Following a lull on Wednesday afternoon, it resumed, 
reportedly involving the use of weapons as heavy as mortars and 
RPGs.  In spite of a meeting arranged by UNMIS between the two sides 
to discuss a ceasefire fighting has continued. Most of the SPLM's 
leadership in the area is in Juba for the National Convention, 
including SPLM Rep Edward Lino. 
 
Civilians Flee, NGOs Trapped

¶3.   According to UN sources in Abyei reports that 30,000 people, 
the bulk of the town's population, have fled into the surrounding 
countryside.  The UN is attempting to organize an emergency relief 
effort to support this new wave of IDPs.  Late May 14, UNMIS was in 
the process of evacuating NGO international staff to Kadugli via 
helicopter.  International staff of two NGOs, GOAL International and 
Save the Children, reportedly were unable to reach the UNMIS 
compound and were forced to return to their own locations, where 
they remain.  UNMIS security in Abyei is attempting to devise a plan 
to extract both groups to the UNMIS compound in order to fly them 
out. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) According to the UN official, efforts to mediate a 
ceasefire have been hampered by the absence of senior SPLM/SPLA 
leadership from Abyei to whom they could reach out.  SPLM 
Administrator Edward Lino is in Juba to attend the SPLM national 
convention there.  The senior, and much respected, SPLA commander of 
the local Joint Integrated Unit (JIU) also is absent. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) In a meeting with ConGen Juba staff, Edward Lino 
corroborated much of the UN's account.  He said that fighting is 
between SAF and SPLA security and that more SPLA are likely to join 
the fighting.  He confirmed that large numbers of civilians (he said 
50,000) have fled the fighting.  Embassy and Consulate Juba are 
seeking to reach out to both the GNU/SAF and SPLM/SPLA to calm the 
situation and try to halt the fighting.  CDA Fernandez spoke to MFA 
U/S Mutriff Siddiq the evening of May 14 about the clashes. The NCP 
is also distracted with their focus on the aftermath of the JEM 
rebel group's attack on the capital and confrontation with Chad. 
Siddiq promised to alert colleagues in the regime to exercise 
restraint. 
 
Comment

¶6.  (SBU) Given the support that the SPLA provided Khartoum during 
the JEM raid on Omdurman a few days ago, and the NCP's effusive 
gratitude as a result, this outbreak of fighting appears to have 
been the result of an unintended clash, rather than anything 
calculated.  As we have reported previously, the tensions inherent 
in the situation and SPLM-NCP brinksmanship have made Abyei a 
disaster waiting to happen.  All it took was a spark to ignite a 
possible conflagration.
