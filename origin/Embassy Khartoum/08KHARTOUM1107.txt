SUBJECT: PRESIDENT BASHIR ADDRESSES EL FASHER 
 
¶1. (SBU) For the first time in over a year, President Bashir 
traveled to Darfur and delivered a speech in El Fasher July 23, 
declaring the government's commitment to peace and economic 
development in Darfur. Addressing a crowd of thousands at an event 
with a heavy security presence, Bashir acknowledged that "injustices 
had occurred in Darfur," but affirmed the government's dedication to 
making peace, as it has done in other parts of the country. He 
pointed to the CPA as the "greatest achievement in Sudan since 
independence."  He avowed a commitment to security for refugees and 
IDPs to return to their villages and to demonstrate this, he 
announced the return of 1,000 families to their homes. He praised 
the people of Darfur for their wisdom and asserted the government's 
willingness to bring together political and tribal leaders, whether 
signatories or not, for a peaceful coexistence. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Parallel to his message of peace, Bashir also pledged to 
continue to develop Darfur, promising investment in infrastructure 
for water, electricity, health, education, and agriculture. 
Specifically, he asserted that construction of the "Western 
Salvation Road" would be completed; the electricity grid would be 
expanded to Darfur through Kordofan; and exploration would commence 
for petroleum and mineral resources. He declared that wealth from 
such natural resources would serve to enrich the people of Darfur 
and not foreign interests trying to exploit Sudan.  Bashir also 
declared a commitment to implement justice in Darfur, and stated 
that Sudan believes in God and answers only to God. He urged that 
the ICC thus not serve as a distraction. He blamed enemies of Sudan 
for continually trying to thwart Sudan's progress and disrupt peace 
both in Darfur and the South, but vowed that they would not succeed. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Although President Bashir's speech was moderate, other 
speakers denounced the ICC indictment against President Bashir, and 
made numerous inflammatory remarks against the United States and 
Israel. One such speaker referred to President Bush as a "war 
criminal", at which point CDA Fernandez walked out in protest. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Following the public event, President Bashir met with a 
delegation of IDPs behind closed doors.  Following the meeting, some 
of the IDP representatives told CDA that they have no problem 
accepting Bashir as president, "but what is important are deeds and 
not words."  They demanded action on compensation, security, and 
development.  They felt Bashir's speech was positive, but was 
"nothing new."  President Bashir also met privately with JSR Adada, 
FC Agwai, and SRSG Qazi.  Read-outs of these meetings will follow 
via septel. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Although Bashir's trip to Darfur has attracted a 
great deal of attention and is calculated to demonstrate that the 
president is eager to find solutions to the Darfur crisis, Bashir 
unfortunately offered little   new.  Absent a radical departure from 
this policy of gradualism, the situation on the ground in Darfur is 
unlikely to change and the president is unlikely to gain support for 
a deferment in the ICC indictment.
