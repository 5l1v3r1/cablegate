SUBJECT: SPLM, SLM TO COOPERATE ON LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR DPA 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a July 3 meeting in Khartoum, Government of Southern 
Sudan (GoSS) Minister of Legal Affairs and Constitutional 
Development Michael Makuei Lueth and Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) 
legal counsel Abdulaziz Sam discussed the importance of developing a 
plan to integrate the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) and the 
Transitional Darfur Regional Authority (TDRA) into the national 
legal framework.  With Poloff in attendance, Makuei and Sam agreed 
that the SLM and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) 
should cooperate on the technical and political levels to 
incorporate the DPA and the TDRA into the interim national 
constitution (INC) and to ensure that the three Darfur state 
constitutions were consistent with national law. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Sam noted that the NCP-appointed governors of the three 
Darfur states were creating new positions in their administrations 
and re-districting areas of the states contrary to the spirit of the 
DPA.  Makuei said that the first step would be to codify the 
provisions of the DPA and the institutions of the TDRA in the INC. 
The constitution was "more powerful" than presidential decrees or 
parliamentary legislation and would force accountability.  At 
present, the absence of a reference to the DPA and the TDRA in the 
constitution allowed the National Congress Party (NCP) to stall 
effective implementation of the agreement. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Integration of the TDRA into the INC would act as a 
"springboard" for addressing legal issues at the state level, 
according to Makuie.  He stressed that the NCP's attempts to 
undermine the institutions of the DPA were a threat to the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and the constitution and pledged 
SPLM technical and political support.  He promised to raise the 
issue with the senior SPLM leadership, including First Vice 
President Salva Kiir. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Makuei and Sam agreed that the SPLM and the SLM would 
establish a more formal working-level relationship to analyze the 
legal status of the DPA and the TDRA and chart next steps.  Two of 
Makuei's "legal experts" were coming to Khartoum from Juba on July 
10 and would meet with Sam.  Makuei asked that the National 
Democratic Institute (NDI), which had provided valuable technical 
expertise to the GoSS during the development of the state 
constitutions in Southern Sudan, be engaged to support the review of 
the DPA and TDRA.
