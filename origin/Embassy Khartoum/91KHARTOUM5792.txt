¶1.  PER DEPARTMENT'S REQUEST, AND RECOGNIZING THE 
IMPORTANCE OF THE UNHRC RAPPORTEUR'S WORK, WE HAVE 
TRANSMITTED A DESENSITIZED VERSION OF KHARTOUM 4769 
BELOW.  WE HAVE TRIED TO ELIMINATED DIRECT REFERENCES TO 
SOURCES AND OTHER IDENTIFYING DETAILS.  THE CABLE 
NEVERTHELESS CONTAINS INFORMATION, SUCH AS THE REPORT 
THAT THE DA'WA TURNS AWAY NON-MUSLIMS WHEN DISTRIBUTING 
ASSISTANCE, WHICH COULD INVITE NEGATIVE REACTION IF MADE 
PUBLIC.  THEREFORE THIS CABLE SHOULD BE USED ONLY RPT 
ONLY FOR MR. RIBEIRO'S BACKGROUND INFORMATION. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶2.  SUMMARY:  THERE IS CLEAR AND MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT 
THE NIF-DOMINATED GOVERNMENT IN KHARTOUM HAS EMBARKED ON 
A CAMPAIGN TO ISLAMIZE SOUTHERN SUDAN AND THOSE 
SOUTHERNERS, MOSTLY DISPLACED, LIVING IN THE NORTH.  IN 
GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH, THE GOS/NIF IS 
UNDERTAKING POLICIES TO GAIN ISLAMIC CONTROL OF REGIONAL 
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE CIVIL SERVICE.  OVER THE 
PAST TWO YEARS, THE SENIOR AND MIDDLE RANKS OF LOCAL 
ADMINISTRATION AND CIVIL SERVICE HAVE BEEN "WEEDED-OUT", 
WITH MUSLIM-SOUTHERNERS AND HARDLINE GOS/NIF SUPPORTERS 
REPLACING PROFESSIONAL SENIOR OFFICERS AND OTHER 
EMPLOYEES.  FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF GOS EDUCATIONAL 
POLICIES, NON-MUSLIM CHILDREN IN THE GOS-CONTROLLED TOWNS 
OF JUBA, RENK, MALAKAL, WAU, AND RAJA ARE COMPELLED TO 
LEARN ARABIC AND STUDY ISLAM.  SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO 
USE ARABIC AS THE SOLE LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION, EVEN 
SCHOOLS RUN BY CHRISTIANS.  IN JUBA, THE EQUATORIA STATE 
MINISTER OF EDUCATION RECENTLY DECREED THAT ISLAM MUST BE 
TAUGHT BEGINNING AT THE NURSERY SCHOOL LEVEL. 
 
¶3.  IN THE NORTH, NON-MUSLIM, SOUTHERNERS FACE ROUTINE 
HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION, CONCURRENTLY RECEIVING THE 
MESSAGE THAT IF THEY BECOME MUSLIMS, THEIR LIVES WILL 
IMPROVE.  ISLAMIC GROUPS, MOST NOTABLY THE DA'WA 
ISLAMIYYA (I.E. THE ISLAMIC CALL), REPORTEDLY OFFER AID 
IN THE FORM OF FOOD AND MONEY TO INDUCE SOUTHERNERS TO 
BECOME MUSLIMS.  GOS/NIF POLICY HAS MADE CONVERSION TO 
ISLAM CONVENIENT, OFTEN PROFITABLE, AND SOMETIMES 
NECESSARY FOR SURVIVAL IN THE NORTH. 
 
¶4.  IN ADDITION, THE GOS IS ESCALATING PRESSURE ON 
CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS PERSONNEL AND INSTITUTIONS.  REPORTS 
OF HARASSMENT, INTIMIDATION, AND INCARCERATION OF CHURCH 
PERSONNEL HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT MONTHS.  MANY BELIEVE 
THAT THIS IS EVIDENCE OF GOS/NIF INTENTION TO EVENTUALLY 
ERADICATE THE "FOREIGN" CHURCH PRESENCE FROM SUDAN, 
THEREBY, THE GOS/NIF HOPES, LEAVING THE FIELD OPEN FOR 
ISLAM. 
 
¶5.  THE GOS/NIF IS DETERMINED TO LAUNCH A SUCCESSFUL 
ISLAMIZATION CAMPAIGN.  IT HAS CONSOLIDATED ITS HOLD OVER 
LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS IN GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF 
THE SOUTH, WITH THE REPUTED LONG-TERM GOAL OF INTRODUCING 
ISLAMIC LAW TO THE SOUTH.  ALSO IMPORTANT IS THE EFFECT 
GOS/NIF POLICIES HAVE ON SOUTHERN CHILDREN.  THESE 
CHILDREN ARE COMPELLED TO LEARN ARABIC AND ISLAM AND ARE 
LEARNING TO LOOK TO MUSLIMS FOR FOOD AND AID.  THEY ARE 
ALSO ABSORBING THE LESSON THAT NON-MUSLIMS PROBABLY HAVE 
LITTLE HOPE OR FUTURE IN SUDAN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
GOVERNMENT IN THE SOUTH 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶6.  IN 1990, THE GOS DECLARED A FEDERAL SYSTEM OF 
GOVERNMENT FOR SUDAN, OSTENSIBLY GIVING GOS-CONTROLLED 
AREAS OF THE SOUTH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AUTONOMY AND 
EXEMPTING THEM FROM SHARIA (I.E. ISLAMIC LAW). 
SUBSEQUENTLY, HOWEVER, KHARTOUM BEGAN A LARGE-SCALE PURGE 
OF SOUTHERN REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE CIVIL 
SERVICE, REPLACING MANY NON-MUSLIMS WITH SOUTHERN MUSLIMS 
AND GOS/NIF HARDLINE SUPPORTERS. 
 
¶7.  SOUTHERN SUDAN IS DIVIDED INTO THREE STATES:  UPPER 
NILE, BAHR EL GHAZAL, AND EQUATORIA.  EACH STATE HAS A 
GOVERNOR, DEPUTY GOVERNOR, AND A POPULAR COMMITTEE.  THE 
GOVERNORS, APPOINTED BY KHARTOUM, ARE ALL NON-MUSLIM 
SOUTHERNERS.  FOLLOWING ITS DECLARATION OF FEDERALISM, 
THE GOS APPOINTED HARDCORE NIF SUPPORTERS AS DEPUTY 
GOVERNORS AND AS STATE MINISTERS OF EDUCATION AND 
CULTURE, FINANCE AND COMMERCE.  THESE APPOINTEES 
REPORTEDLY ANSWER ONLY TO KHARTOUM.  THE DEPUTY 
GOVERNORS, AND NOT THE GOVERNORS AS BEFORE, HAVE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE KEY MINISTRIES.  IT IS ALSO 
RELIABLY REPORTED THAT THESE STATE MINISTERS HAVE PURGED, 
OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PURGING, THEIR STAFFS OF 
NON-MUSLIMS AND NON-NIF SUPPORTERS.  THE GOVERNORS HAVE 
THUS BEEN EFFECTIVELY STRIPPED OF MOST REAL POWER.  IN 
ADDITION, ON AUGUST 8, TWO SENIOR AND PROMINENT SOUTHERN 
GOVERNORS WERE REPLACED (REF).  THE NEW GOVERNORS ARE 
ALSO NON-MUSLIM SOUTHERNERS BUT BOTH MEN ARE FIRM 
SUPPORTERS OF THE NIF.  (NOTE:  IN A NATIONALLY-TELEVISED 
SWEARING-IN CEREMONY, THE NEWLY-APPOINTED GOVERNORS WERE 
SHOWN TAKING THE OATH OF OFFICE, ONE HAND RAISED, THE 
OTHER ON THE KORAN.  END NOTE. 
 
¶8.  IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT SOME OFFICIALS IN THE 
SENIOR AND MIDDLE RANKS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND CIVIL 
SERVICE IN GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS HAVE BEEN "WEEDED-OUT" 
AND REPLACED BY MUSLIM-SOUTHERNERS AND HARDLINE GOS/NIF 
SUPPORTERS.  HISTORICALLY, THE BEST SCHOOLS IN THE SOUTH 
HAVE BEEN CHURCH SCHOOLS, SO THE BEST-EDUCATED AND MOST 
EXPERIENCED CIVIL SERVANTS IN THE SOUTH ARE OFTEN 
CHRISTIANS.  MANY OF THOSE REPLACING THEM ARE LESS 
QUALIFIED AND LACK EXPERIENCE; THEIR ONLY QUALIFICATION 
IS THAT THEY ARE MUSLIMS.  FORCED RETIREMENT OF 
NON-MUSLIMS AND NON-NIF SUPPORTERS HAS BECOME WIDESPREAD. 
 
¶9.  IN JULY 1991, A GOS-CONTROLLED NEWSPAPER REPORTED 
THAT THE EQUATORIA POPULAR COMMITTEE HAD BEEN GIVEN 
LEGISLATIVE POWERS, AND THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD 
HENCEFORTH FORMULATE AND PASS LOCAL LAWS.  (NOTE:  THE 
POPULAR COMMITTEES IN BAHR AL GHAZAL AND UPPER NILE WILL 
APPARENTLY HAVE THE SAME MANDATE, ALTHOUGH THERE HAS AS 
YET BEEN NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY 
OPERATING IN THIS MANNER.  END NOTE)  THIS IS IN 
CONTRAST, THE NEWSPAPER POINTED OUT, TO THE POPULAR 
COMMITTEES IN THE NORTH WHICH ARE SOLELY CONSULTATIVE AND 
REGULATORY BODIES.  THE MEMBERS OF THE SOUTHERN POPULAR 
COMMITTEES, IT WAS REPORTED, WILL BE "SELECTED" TO 
"REPRESENT THE PEOPLE UNTIL ELECTIONS ARE HELD." 
ELECTIONS, THE NEWSPAPER EXPLAINED, CANNOT BE HELD NOW 
BECAUSE OF THE CIVIL WAR. 
 
¶10.  COMMENT:  IT IS REPORTED THAT MONEY, HOUSES, AND 
POWER, IS USED BY THE GOS OFTEN TO GAIN THE SUPPORT OF 
SOUTHERNERS WHO ARE THEN APPOINTED TO THE POPULAR 
COMMITTEES.  THUS, SOME SOUTHERN POLITICIANS, FOR 
FINANCIAL GAIN, SUPPORT THE GOS/NIF AND ITS POLICIES. 
THERE IS SOME FEAR THAT THE POPULAR COMMITTEES/ASSEMBLIES 
WILL EVENTUALLY BE USED TO "OPT INTO SHARIA."  IN HIS 
SPEECH OF DECEMBER 31, PRESIDENT AL-BASHIR SAID "THE 
LEGAL SITUATION IN THE SOUTHERN STATES WILL REMAIN AS IT 
IS UNTIL ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW LEGISLATIVE BODIES THAT 
WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED...."  BECAUSE OF THE VAGUENESS OF 
THIS STATEMENT, BASHIR MAY HAVE SUBTLY OPENED UP THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT SHARIA MIGHT ONE DAY BE LEGISLATED FOR 
THE SOUTH.  THE MAJORITY OF SOUTHERNERS ARE NOT MUSLIMS 
AND, BY ALL INDICATIONS, DO NOT WANT TO BE GOVERNED BY 
ISLAMIC LAW.  THERE IS FEAR THAT THE GOS/NIF WILL 
MANIPULATE THE POPULAR COMMITTEES SO THEY WILL VOTE TO 
MAKE SHARIA LAW IN THE SOUTH.  END COMMENT. 
 
 
THE CIVIL SERVICE 
- - - - - - - - - 
 
¶11.  IN 1991, THE GOS REPORTEDLY RECONSTITUTED THE CIVIL 
SERVICE IN SUDAN.  PREVIOUSLY, NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN 
SUDAN EACH HAD THEIR OWN SEPARATE CIVIL SERVICE.  UNDER 
THE NEW LAWS, SUDAN HAS A SINGLE CIVIL SERVICE 
ADMINISTERED BY AUTHORITIES IN KHARTOUM.  GOS-APPOINTED 
"SECRETARY GENERALS," ALL KNOWN NIF SUPPORTERS, DIRECTLY 
CONTROL THE CIVIL BUREAUCRACY IN EACH SOUTHERN STATE. 
THROUGH THE SECRETARY GENERALS, THE GOS/NIF CONTROLS 
RECRUITMENT OF NEW EMPLOYEES, JOB ASSIGNMENTS, AND 
PROMOTIONS.  THERE ARE REPORTS OF NON-MUSLIMS BEING 
SIDESTEPPED FOR PROMOTIONS, SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS BEING 
REPLACED BY INEXPERIENCED NIF SUPPORTERS, AND NUMEROUS 
INSTANCES OF FORCED RETIREMENT OF NON-MUSLIMS AND NON-NIF 
SUPPORTERS. 
 
 
ISLAMIZATION/ARABIZATION OF EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶12.  IN ADDITION TO POLICIES DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN 
GOS/NIF CONTROL OVER SOUTHERN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS, THE 
EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUM IN THE SOUTH IS BEING ARABIZED AND 
ISLAMIZED.  REPORTEDLY, THE EQUATORIA STATE MINISTER OF 
EDUCATION RECENTLY DECREED THAT ISLAM BE A COMPULSORY 
SUBJECT IN ALL NURSERY SCHOOLS IN JUBA (NOTE: STUDENTS 
CANNOT ENTER PRIMARY SCHOOL UNLESS THEY HAVE COMPLETED 
NURSERY SCHOOL.  END NOTE).  IN JUBA, IT IS REPORTEDLY 
ALSO OFFICIAL POLICY THAT ALL SCHOOLS, INCLUDING THOSE 
RUN BY CHRISTIANS, MUST USE ARABIC AS THE LANGUAGE OF 
INSTRUCTION, AND ENGLISH MAY NOT BE INTRODUCED AS A 
SUBJECT UNTIL THE FIFTH GRADE. 
 
¶13.  IN MALAKAL, IN UPPER NILE STATE, THE ONLY SCHOOL 
STILL OPEN IS RUN BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH  (NOTE: ALL 
OTHER SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER AS GOS-ARMY BARRACKS. 
END NOTE).  REPORTEDLY, THE UPPER NILE MINISTER OF 
EDUCATION INFORMED THE SCHOOL IN JULY THAT ARABIC MUST BE 
THE SOLE LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION. 
 
¶14.  GOS/NIF POLICY HAS LED TO A PROLIFERATION OF 
"KHALWAS," I.E. ISLAMIC PRIMARY SCHOOLS, IN 
GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH.  STUDENTS NOT 
ATTENDING THESE SCHOOLS ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN THEY 
GO ON TO SECONDARY SCHOOL SINCE THEY LACK SKILLS IN 
ARABIC.  MOREOVER, PROPOSED NEW NATIONAL LEGISLATION 
WOULD MAKE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF ISLAMIC AND ARABIC 
STUDIES AT THE SECONDARY LEVEL COMPULSORY FOR CONTINUING 
ON TO UNIVERSITY STUDIES. 
 
¶15. REPORTEDLY, NORTHERN SECURITY FORCES, PRESENT IN 
GOS-CONTROLLED CITIES SINCE LAST YEAR, SOMETIMES BRING 
NON-MUSLIM CHILDREN INTO THE KHALWAS AGAINST THE WISHES 
OF THEIR PARENTS.  TO WHOM OR WHAT INSTITUTIONS THESE 
FORCES ARE ACCOUNTABLE IS UNKNOWN. 
 
 
"RICE MUSLIMS" IN THE SOUTH 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶16.  AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL, SOUTHERNERS ARE BEING 
CONVERTED TO ISLAM WITH FOOD AND MONEY.  THROUGHOUT 
GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH THE THREAT OF 
STARVATION IS VERY REAL.  OPERATING IN THESE AREAS ARE 
MUSLIM GROUPS, MOST NOTABLY THE DA'WA, WHICH DISTRIBUTE 
FOOD AND OTHER AID.  THEY REPORTEDLY GIVE AID ONLY TO 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO DECLARE THEMSELVES TO BE MUSLIMS AND 
REGISTER AS SUCH.  SIMILARLY, GOS/NIF-SUPPORTED KHALWAS 
PROVIDE FOOD FOR THEIR STUDENTS AND OFFER OTHER FORMS OF 
AID, WHILE GOS-RESTRICTIONS ON CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATIONS 
MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE 
SIMILAR ASSISTANCE.  EVEN SOME DEVOUTLY CHRISTIAN PARENTS 
SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO THESE SCHOOLS RATHER THAN DEPRIVE 
THEM OF FOOD.  THERE ARE ISOLATED REPORTS OF MONEY AND 
FOOD BEING OFFERED TO PREGNANT MOTHERS TO REGISTER THEIR 
NEWBORNS AS MUSLIMS AND OF PARENTS BEING PAID TO SEND 
THEIR CHILDREN TO KHALWAS. 
 
¶17.  COMMENT:  SOME BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE MAJORITY 
OF SOUTHERNERS CONVERTING TO ISLAM ARE "RICE MUSLIMS, 
I.E. THAT THEY ARE DOING SO SOLELY BECAUSE THEY WANT 
FOOD.  FEW HAVE ACTUALLY ACCEPTED ISLAM AND IT IS 
BELIEVED THAT MOST OF THEM WILL REVERT TO THEIR FORMER 
RELIGION WHEN STARVATION IS NOT A CONSTANT THREAT. 
 
¶18.  OF MORE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCE, HOWEVER, IS THE 
EFFECT ISLAMIZATION MAY HAVE ON CHILDREN IN 
GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS.  A GENERATION OF NON-MUSLIM 
CHILDREN NOW SPEAK BETTER ARABIC THAN THEIR TRIBAL 
LANGUAGE AND ARE TAKING TO ISLAMIC CUSTOMS.  WHEN THEY 
ARE HUNGRY THEY CAN GO TO THE KHALWA, TO THE MOSQUE, OR 
TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE DA'WA, BUT THEY CANNOT EXPECT 
THE SAME PROVISIONS FROM THE NEEDY CHURCHES.  END COMMENT. 
 
 
... AND IN THE NORTH 
- - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶19.  IN THE NORTH, WHERE AS MUCH AS ONE-QUARTER OF THE 
POPULATION OF SOUTHERN SUDAN IS NOW DISPLACED (AS MANY AS 
2,500,000 PEOPLE), THE NEED FOR AID IS ACUTE.  MOST 
DISPLACED LIVE IN CAMPS OUTSIDE KHARTOUM, WITH MEAGER 
FACILITIES AND FEW RESOURCES.  AS IN THE SOUTH, ISLAMIC 
GROUPS, INCLUDING THE DA'WA, DISPENSE RELIEF.  THIS 
RELIEF IS, ONCE AGAIN, RESERVED FOR MUSLIMS.  REPORTEDLY, 
REFUGEES SEEKING FOOD ARE ASKED TO GIVE THEIR NAMES.  IF 
THEY GIVE A MUSLIM NAME, THEY ARE GIVEN FOOD; IF THEY 
GIVE A CHRISTIAN NAME, THEY ARE NOT.  THESE REFUGEES HAVE 
THE OPTION, OF COURSE, OF CONVERTING, TAKING A MUSLIM 
NAME, AND THEN RECEIVING FOOD.  (NOTE: IN ISLAM, A SIMPLE 
DECLARATION IS ALL THAT IS REQUIRED FOR CONVERSION.  END 
NOTE) 
 
¶20.  NON-MUSLIM SOUTHERNERS IN THE NORTH ARE ROUTINELY 
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN SCHOOLS, THE WORKPLACE, AND IN 
THEIR EVERYDAY EXISTENCE.  AT THE SAME TIME IT IS MADE 
CLEAR THAT IF THEY BECOME MUSLIMS THEIR LIVES WILL BE 
MUCH EASIER.  MANY SOURCES REPORT THAT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, 
NON-MUSLIM CHILDREN ARE HARASSED, GIRLS ARE PROPOSITIONED 
AND INSULTED, AND NON-MUSLIM STUDENTS ARE OFTEN GRADED 
UNFAIRLY.  THEY ALSO ARE COMPELLED TO STUDY ARABIC AND 
ISLAM.  ALTHOUGH SOME SCHOOLS, RUN BY SOUTHERNERS, EXIST 
IN THE DISPLACED CAMPS, REPORTS INDICATE THAT THE GOS/NIF 
PLANS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEM.  THE GOS DESIRES TO PLACE 
MUSLIM NORTHERNERS AS INSTRUCTORS TO TEACH ARABIC AND 
ISLAM TO THE DISPLACED.  AS WITH THE SOUTH, GOS/NIF 
ISLAMIZATION POLICIES ARE CLEARLY AIMED AT CHILDREN OF 
SOUTHERNERS.  SUCH POLICIES HAVE SERIOUS LONG-TERM 
RAMIFICATIONS FOR NON-MUSLIMS IN THE NORTH. 
 
¶21.  SOUTHERNERS ALSO OFTEN HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING 
EMPLOYMENT.  OUR SOURCES REPORT THAT CHRISTIAN EMPLOYEES 
ARE FREQUENTLY SINGLED OUT FOR JOBS WHICH REQUIRE THEM TO 
WORK DURING SUNDAY MASS OR ON THEIR RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS. 
IN KHARTOUM THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS REPORTS OF 
CHRISTIANS BEING EVICTED FROM THEIR HOMES BY MUSLIM 
LANDLORDS. 
 
¶22.  IN ADDITION TO THIS OVERT DISCRIMINATION, 
SOUTHERNERS IN THE NORTH ARE BEING EFFECTIVELY ISLAMIZED 
BY THEIR ENVIRONMENT.  SOUTHERNERS IN THE NORTH KEEP AN 
ISLAMIC WORK WEEK (SUN-THURS).  THEY RECEIVE BONUSES AND 
VACATIONS FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS FOR RAMADAN AND THE EID, 
BUT NOT FOR CHRISTMAS OR EASTER; THEIR FAMILIES THUS ARE 
BEGINNING TO CELEBRATE ISLAMIC HOLIDAYS.  SOME CHRISTIAN 
SOUTHERNERS HAVE ALSO BEGUN TAKING PART IN GOS-SPONSORED 
"MASS MARRIAGES."  THIS IS A PRACTICE INTRODUCED BY THE 
GOS IN RECENT MONTHS TO PROMOTE THE INSTITUTION OF 
MARRIAGE AS A SOCIALLY STABILIZING FORCE.  PUBLIC 
CEREMONIES ARE CONDUCTED IN WHICH LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE 
ARE MARRIED BEFORE MUSLIM AND, IN A FEW CASES, CHRISTIAN 
CLERGY.  COUPLES MARRYING IN THESE MASS CEREMONIES 
RECEIVE MONEY AND GIFTS FROM THE GOVERNMENT.  MANY 
SOUTHERN WOMEN IN THE NORTH ARE DONNING THE TRADITIONAL 
NORTHERN FEMALE DRESS, THE TOBE.  THE TOBE IS A GARMENT 
WHICH COVERS A WOMAN UP FROM HEAD TO FOOT BUT NOT THE 
FACE.  THOSE WOMEN WHO WEAR THE TOBE ARE GENERALLY SPARED 
SOME HARASSMENT. 
 
¶23.  COMMENT:  AS A RESULT OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND THE 
GOS/NIF'S ISLAMIZATION CAMPAIGN, MANY SOUTHERNERS IN THE 
NORTH NOW SPEAK ARABIC, STUDY ISLAM, AND TAKE TO ISLAMIC 
CUSTOMS.  BOTH YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE ARE GIVEN THE SAME 
MESSAGE, BLATANTLY OR SUBTLY--THAT IT IS BETTER TO BE A 
MUSLIM THAN A NON-MUSLIM.  GOS/NIF POLICIES HAVE 
ACCORDINGLY MADE BECOMING A MUSLIM CONVENIENT, OFTEN 
PROFITABLE, AND SOMETIMES NECESSARY FOR SURVIVAL IN THE 
NORTH.  END COMMENT 
 
 
RECEPTIVITY TO ISLAM 
- - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶24.  SOME SOUTHERNERS, WHETHER LIVING IN THE NORTH OR THE 
SOUTH, ARE REPORTEDLY MORE RECEPTIVE TO ISLAM THEN 
OTHERS, DEPENDING ON THEIR TRIBAL AND REGIONAL 
BACKGROUND.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE TRIBES IN THE UPPER NILE 
REGION (DINKA, SHILLUK, NUER) ARE REPORTEDLY LESS 
SUSCEPTIBLE TO ISLAMIZATION, GIVEN THEIR STRONG TRIBAL 
TRADITIONS AND STRUCTURES.  THEIR CULTURAL BACKGROUND, 
INCLUDING EXPERIENCE WITH SLAVERY AND COLONIALISM, ALSO 
MAKES THEM SUSPICIOUS OF OUTSIDE INFLUENCE.  TRIBES IN 
EQUATORIA ARE, APPARENTLY, NOT AT ALL OPEN TO ISLAM. 
EQUATORIA HAS NO BORDERS WITH THE NORTH AND THERE HAS 
BEEN HISTORICALLY LITTLE CONTACT OR ASSIMILATION.  MOST 
EQUATORIANS ARE FOLLOWERS OF TRADITIONAL RELIGIONS AND 
THEY MAINTAIN STRONG CULTURAL AND TRIBAL CUSTOMS. 
SLAVERY AND ITS ATTENDANT WARFARE HAVE MADE THEM HOSTILE 
TO OUTSIDERS, ESPECIALLY MUSLIMS. 
 
¶25.  IN CONTRAST, TRIBES LIVING ON THE BORDER WITH THE 
NORTH, DUE TO LONG-TERM INTERACTION WITH NORTHERNERS, ARE 
ALREADY SOMEWHAT ASSIMILATED AND THUS MAY BE MORE 
RECEPTIVE TO ISLAM.  THE TRIBES IN BAHR EL GHAZAL, IN 
SOUTH EASTERN SUDAN, HAVE HISTORICALLY INTERMARRIED AND 
MIXED WITH THE NORTHERNERS LIVING ON THEIR BORDERS.  THEY 
HAVE ASSIMILATED FOR CONVENIENCE AND ARE, AS A RESULT, 
MORE EASILY ISLAMIZED. 
 
 
HARASSMENT OF CHURCHES 
- - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶26.  THE ACTIVITIES OF NON-MUSLIM RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS, 
INCLUDING SCHOOLS, HAVE BEEN SHARPLY CURTAILED BY THE 
GOS.  USING THE 1962 FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY ACT AS A 
TOOL, THE GOS FORBIDS THE BUILDING OF CHURCHES, CHURCH 
FACILITIES (INCLUDING SCHOOLS) AND THE ORGANIZATION OF 
CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES.  CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS 
ORGANIZATIONS ARE MONITORED CLOSELY AND THE AMOUNT OF 
FUNDS THEY MAY EXPEND IS LIMITED BY GOS REGULATIONS.  IN 
THE GOS-CONTROLLED AREAS OF THE SOUTH, NUMEROUS MOSQUES 
AND KHALWAS ARE BEING BUILT WHILE CHURCHES CONTINUE TO BE 
DENIED PERMITS TO BUILD OR REPAIR FACILITIES. 
 
¶27.  CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS PERSONNEL THROUGHOUT SUDAN ARE 
ROUTINELY HARASSED AND INTIMIDATED.  RECENTLY THE GOS 
INCARCERATED A CATHOLIC PRIEST AND THREE OF HIS STAFF IN 
DONGOLA, IN NORTHERN SUDAN, AND TRIED TO EXPEL FOUR OF 
MOTHER TERESA'S MISSIONARIES.  SOME MAINTAIN THAT THIS IS 
EVIDENCE OF GOS/NIF INTENTION TO EVENTUALLY ERADICATE THE 
"FOREIGN" CHURCH PRESENCE FROM SUDAN, THUS LEAVING THE 
FIELD OPEN TO ISLAM. 
 
COMMENT AND CONCLUSION 
- - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶28.  THERE IS LITTLE REASON TO DOUBT THAT THIS 
NIF-DOMINATED GOVERNMENT HOPES TO ISLAMIZE SOUTHERN SUDAN 
AND THOSE SOUTHERNERS LIVING IN THE NORTH.  GOS/NIF 
POLICIES SEEM DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THEIR SUPPORTERS 
WILL DOMINATE SOUTHERN POLITICS.  SUCH TACTICS FUEL FEARS 
THAT THE SOUTH WILL EVENTUALLY BE GOVERNED BY SHARIA. 
THE GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CHURCH, ALREADY 
UNFRIENDLY AND INHOSPITABLE, IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE 
OBSTRUCTIONIST.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE CHILDREN OF 
SOUTHERNERS, THE NEXT GENERATION OF SOUTHERN CITIZENS AND 
LEADERS, ARE BEING AGGRESSIVELY ISLAMIZED AND ARABIZED. 
THE IMPLICATIONS FOR SUDAN'S FUTURE, IF THIS EFFORT IS 
SUCCESSFUL, WILL BE RADICAL AND TRANSFORMING AND WILL 
IMPACT ON THE STABILITY OF THE ENTIRE REGION.
