REF:  Khartoum 1361 
 
¶1.  Security Update: 
 
¶A.  The security situation in North Darfur remains tense. 
Reports have been received of Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) 
factional clashes, confrontations between Zaghawa and Fur 
ethnic groups, and aggressive posturing of the SLA 
faction led by Abdul Wahid. 
 
¶B.  On June 27, USAID partner Relief International (RI) 
reported that RI staff in Tawila received a formal letter 
from the SLA/Wahid faction on June 24 ordering the 
relocation of all non-Fur staff.  The house of a Zaghawa 
employee was vandalized by Fur elements believed to be 
SLA/Wahid on June 26.  RI has since relocated the man and 
one other Zaghawa employee to El Fasher.  RI is 
assembling staff in El Fasher from June 29 to July 2 for 
discussions regarding next steps but has not expressed 
any plan to suspend or discontinue activities in the 
Tawila area. 
 
¶C.  RI also described alleged SLA/Wahid plans to stage an 
attack on SLA/Minawi forces in Tawila.  Observers fear 
that if an attack occurs, SLA/Wahid combatants may seek 
refuge in the internally displaced persons (IDP) 
gathering situated near the compound of the African Union 
Mission in Sudan (AMIS) and that SLA/Minawi forces may 
storm the area.  AMIS is currently patrolling Tawila and 
surrounding villages, but this action may not be enough 
to deter an attack. 
 
¶D.  On June 27, AMIS reported small but widespread 
harassment of civilian populations by Arab militias, SLA 
elements, and bandits in North Darfur. 
 
¶E.  On June 27, the UN Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that several attacks 
on several villages located north of Tawila have occurred 
in recent days.  The UN Department of Safety and Security 
(UNDSS) confirmed one attack on June 25 and reported 
livestock stolen, four civilians killed, and an unknown 
number of women raped. 
 
¶2.  Humanitarian Access Update: 
 
¶A.  On June 26, the GNU authorized UN agencies to resume 
operations in Darfur.  On June 25, the Sudanese 
government had ordered the suspension of all UN programs 
in Darfur, except those of the World Food Program 
(WFP) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF).  The 
suspension did not result in a deterioration of the 
humanitarian situation.  The GNU ordered the 
suspension on the grounds that the UN Mission in Sudan 
(UNMIS) overstepped its mandate when UNMIS reportedly 
flew the former SLA/Minawi humanitarian coordinator from 
North Darfur to Southern Kordofan State. 
 
¶B.  As per reftel, on May 20, SLA/Minawi 
allegedly arrested SLA humanitarian coordinator Sulayman 
Jamous, accused of not supporting the Darfur Peace 
Agreement (DPA), which SLA/Minawi signed in early May. 
On June 14, a UN team visited Jamous.  On June 22, Jamous 
was released to UNMIS and taken to El Fasher under UN 
protection.  On June 24, an UNMIS helicopter reportedly 
transported Jamous from El Fasher in North Darfur to 
Kadugli in Southern Kordofan.  GNU officials stated that 
the action constituted a violation of Sudan's 
sovereignty. 
 
¶C.  This incident has significantly strained the 
relationship between UNMIS, UNDSS, and GNU officials in 
North Darfur.  In addition, on June 22, an UNMIS human 
rights team reportedly picked up a wounded SLA/Wahid 
combatant and transported him via helicopter to El 
Fasher.  GNU police were waiting at the airport when the 
UNMIS helicopter landed and took the combatant into 
custody.  The SLA/Wahid have interpreted this event as an 
UNMIS attempt to make amends with the GNU and are now 
mistrustful of UNMIS impartiality.
