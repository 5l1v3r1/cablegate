SUBJECT:  SUDAN - World Bank Holds Preparatory Meeting for 
Sudan Consortium 
 
 
¶1.  On February 7, The World Bank convened a meeting to 
brief donors on the progress toward preparing the Sudan 
Consortium meeting in Paris on March 8 and 9, 2006.  Charge 
and USAID rep attended.  The meeting was co-chaired by the 
Norwegian Ambassador, the Joint National Transition Team 
(JNTT), and Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) 
representatives. 
 
¶2.  The JNTT, representing the Government of National Unity 
(GNU), reported that they are working on the following items 
in preparation for their contribution to the meeting: 
 
 -- Finalizing inputs to the tracking matrix designed to 
track the Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) 
-- Preparing summary of progress on implementation of the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) 
-- Updating Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) operations 
-- Tabulating commitments to the U.N. Work Plan 
-- Calculating the financing Gap. 
 
¶3.  The JNTT representative Dr. Tag el Sir reminded the 
audience of the new role that has been assumed by the JNTT 
by Republican Decree issued at the end of 2005, namely: 
 
-- to solicit, monitor, and expedite aid; 
-- to organize conferences; 
-- to follow up on the implementation of the CPA in 
coordination with the Assessment and Evaluation Commission 
(AEC); and 
-- to coordinate with international organizations to ensure 
interventions are part of government's strategic plan. 
 
He reminded the group that non-MDTF donors (amongst whom are 
the U.S. and the EC) should coordinate all funding with the 
JNTT before any coordination is undertaken with the MDTF 
oversight committee. 
 
¶4.  The GOSS, represented by the Minister of Finance, 
indicated the GOSS priorities that will be reflected in 
meeting documents, namely agriculture, human resource 
capacity building, infrastructure, and institutional 
structures for governance.  Further, he reported that: 
-- the interim constitutions for the states are now under 
preparation and moving along well. 
-- a local government framework has been established and a 
decentralization workshop has taken place. 
-- the budget for 2006 will be presented to the GOSS 
assembly by March.  The GOSS expects 1.3 billion in oil 
revenue, complemented by about 200 million from donors, for 
a total of 1.5 billion available in 2006. 
-- the headcount of the civil service had begun with the 
deadline of end February to complete the payroll. 
 
¶5.  The World Bank representative highlighted key points 
from the work of the staff assessment by World Bank, IMF, 
and United Nations that is currently underway.  The Bank 
noted that macro-economic performance remains "strong" in 
Sudan and that "pro-poor" spending planned for 2006 has 
significantly increased over 2005 levels.  In addition, the 
Bank highlighted that resource transfers to the states 
including oil revenue to the GOSS will be vastly increased 
under the GNU's 2006 budget plan in keeping with the CPA. 
Areas of concern for the GNU include: Darfur, 
operationalizing the CPA, transparency in the oil sector, 
and increasing support to the three areas.  Areas of concern 
related to the GOSS include: civil service capacity 
building, management of public finance, decentralization, 
and developing a regulatory and legal framework for private 
sector investment. 
 
¶6.  The GNU reported that the government delegation to the 
Paris meeting would be led by a senior official, likely 
First-Vice President Kiir.  The GOSS said the same.  The 
World Bank announced that the Vice President of the IMF 
would attend.  The SRSG will represent the U.N. delegation 
and the development minister will lead the Norwegian 
delegation.  Other donors were encouraged to send high-level 
delegations as well.  The Bank announced that invitations 
and a final agenda would be sent out by February 7 or 8, 
¶2006.

¶7.  Although Darfur was not a specific agenda item of the 
February 6 meeting, the EC noted that it would be difficult 
for the commission to attract new pledges for Sudan in Paris 
until the problem of Darfur is solved.  Minister of 
Humanitarian Affairs, one of the SPLM representatives on the 
JNTT, Kosti Minibe, said that he understood that Darfur was 
of concern to the donors but hoped the Darfur "situation" 
would not overshadow the March meeting.  He assured the 
donors that the government would provide an update on the 
political negotiations as an agenda item in Paris.  Charge 
followed up, noting that even though Darfur is not a 
specific topic in Paris, the spectre of Darfur will 
inevitably influence the meeting.  JNTT member Sir said that 
he had recently visited Darfur and after meeting with many 
people, came away with the belief that if the government 
could provide "some services" this might make a huge 
difference in solving the problems of the region. 
 
¶8.  Comment:  The World Bank has set aside only 45 minutes 
on day one of the conference to tackle both an update on the 
CPA and the status of peace talks in Darfur.  With the 
current security situation deteriorating visibly throughout 
Darfur, new displacements of populations occurring, talks 
reportedly stalled in Abuja, and the HAC cracking down on 
NGOs with lame bureaucratic impediments (septel), Darfur 
could indeed become the "Banquo's ghost" of the Paris 
meeting.
