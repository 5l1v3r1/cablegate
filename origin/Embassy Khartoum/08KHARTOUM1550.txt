¶1. (SBU) A political officer at the Chinese Embassy in Khartoum 
confirmed to poloff on October 20 that nine (9) Greater Nile 
Petroleum Workers were kidnapped on October 18 at approximately noon 
by "an unknown armed group" in South Kordofan State.  The Chinese 
official could not confirm the involvement of the Justice and 
Equality Movement.  According to this source, a Sudanese driver was 
later released, but the nine Chinese employees are still being held. 
 Representatives from the Chinese embassy are traveling to the 
region now to address the situation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Also on October 20, Hassan Subahi, a representative of 
Misseriya tribe from the Owlad Amran clan predominant in the area of 
the attack  spoke to poloff.  Subahi stated that he was not sure 
whether the attack was committed by members of his tribe or another 
group.  Contrary to information from the Chinese Embassy, Subahi 
stated that 6 Chinese and 3 Sudanese were kidnapped.  Subahi said 
that there are two hostile groups working in their area, one led by 
a man named "Rizeigi" from the Owlad Amran clan and another led by 
"Fadeel" from the Owlad Kamil.  Subahi stated that he was not sure 
which group was responsible for the attack, but downplayed the 
group's significance saying, "these are local actors that are not 
that tied to JEM leadership."  Subahi stated that the local 
population's frustration with the oil companies' reckless operations 
and the industry's failure to benefit their community may have 
inspired the attack.  He also said that in past kidnappings, foreign 
oil companies may have secretly paid ransom money to kidnappers, 
essentially encouraging repeated attacks. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  On October 19, the Governor of South Kordofan Umar 
Suleiman Adam told CDA Fernandez that a JEM faction led led by 
"Fadeel" is responsible for this attack.  The Governor claimed that 
the group only consists of seven men and is more a group of bandits 
than a rebel movement. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  This is not the first time that oil facilities 
have been targeted in Sudan.  The Defra oil field was attacked by 
JEM in October (reftel) and December 2007 and followed by attacks on 
Indian facilities in July 2008.  Post will continue to follow this 
event as it unfolds.  END COMMENT.
