¶1.  (U) On April 7, UNMIS Force Commander LTG Jasbiri Singh Lidder 
announced that both Sudan's National Congress Party (NCP) and the 
Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement (SPLM) have granted UNMIS 
Authority to patrol freely within the Abyei area for 14 days. 
Previously, UNMIS had been restricted to the town of Abyei by both 
SAF and SPLA checkpoints on its outskirts and unable to patrol the 
surrounding countryside.  UNMIS now will be able to monitor and 
report on any troop deployments throughout the Abyei region. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Tensions have been rising in Abyei since the SPLM's 
unilateral appointment of Edward Lino as SPLM Coordinator/Abyei 
"Administrator."  They sharply increased when Lino arrived in town 
with a company-sized SPLA force and delivered an anti-Miseriyya 
address to the Ngok Dinka community.  They escalated further when 
the SAF responded by deploying a reportedly-330 man force to the 
town on March 31.  There have been widespread, but unconfirmed, 
rumors of an even larger SAF troop buildup to the north of Abyei 
town and additional SPLA units moving into the area. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT: During his April 2-3 visit to Abyei (refs), a 
variety of contacts told CDA Fernandez that the greatest immediate 
threat of violence stemmed from unsubstantiated rumors of ethnic 
violence following the SPLA and SAF troop deployments and the 
growing anxiety among the population.  It is too early to determine 
whether UNMIS will have the open access LTG Lidder claims, since 
local commanders often restrict movement despite clearances given in 
Khartoum.  However if UNMIS is able to exercise its new authority, 
even if only temporarily, it will provide a new measure of 
transparency to the region's security situation and a check on 
public hysteria. This will be even more significant if the two sides 
fail on April 9, once again, to achieve a compromise on the troubled 
region's borders.
