SUBJECT: DARFUR: JANJAWEED ATTACKS CONTINUE IN EL FASHER 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Janjaweed attacks in El Fasher continued 
throughout December 5 and 6.  Between 1900 and 2300 hours, sporadic 
gunfire was heard around El Fasher.  This resulted in two 
fatalities--a 15-year-old student and a police officer--and two 
injuries, both students.  All victims were Zaghawa living in the 
center of the city.  End summary. 
¶2. (SBU) On the morning of December 6, Janjaweed forces were 
observed departing the town, looting and destroying shops as they 
went.  The forces then deployed to the bridge on the main road 
between El Fasher town center and the airport.  An EU military 
observer reported 300-400 Janjaweed vehicles at the bridge, 100 of 
which were dug into reinforced positions.  The forces were heavily 
armed with 12.7 machine guns and 60 and 82 mm mortars. By 1500 
hours, the Janjaweed had pulled back from the bridge and relocated 
southwest of the airport. 
¶3. (SBU) The death of the 15-year-old student sparked protests in 
the center of El Fasher on December 6.  Due to the large number of 
armed men in the town center, the situation quickly deteriorated 
into rioting, and at approximately 1000 hours, shooting broke out 
and continued for 30-45 minutes.  Two more students were critically 
injured.  Shopkeepers and students then stoned several African Union 
Mission in Sudan (AMIS) vehicles, apparently in retaliation for its 
inaction. The two cafes outside of ZamZam internally displaced 
persons (IDP) camp were looted and burned by a mob also protesting 
AMIS' lack of action. 
¶4. (SBU) During the December 6 Cease-fire Commission (CFC) meeting, 
participants discussed the incidents of recent days.  The AMIS 
Deputy Force Commander Frank Kamanzi formed a sub committee to 
conduct an investigation.  The Government representative to the CFC 
did not arrive, and when the subcommittee attempted to visit ZamZam, 
protesters turned them back.  At about 1445 hours, sporadic small 
arms fire and grenade explosions were heard a half kilometer outside 
the town center. 
¶5. (SBU) Several sources reported over 1,000 mixed Janjaweed and 
Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) moving south towards El Fasher from the 
Kutum area on the afternoon of December 6.  Approximately 60 
Janjaweed/SAF trucks were seen reinforcing Kutum town December 1, 
and it appears these are the same vehicles.
