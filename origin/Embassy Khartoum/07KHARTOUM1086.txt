¶1.  Summary:  In July, unseasonably heavy rains and subsequent 
flooding have affected more than 28,000 households in Khartoum, 
Northern Kordofan, White Nile, Kassala, and Blue Nile states in 
northern Sudan, according to Sudanese government officials and 
humanitarian organizations.  Government agencies are coordinating 
with the humanitarian community and have formed state-level 
emergency committees to organize the humanitarian response.  To 
date, these agencies are working to meet needs, which have not 
surpassed current stocks and capacity to respond.  USAID and 
partners are monitoring the situation and are prepared to mobilize 
rapidly to provide additional assistance if necessary.  End summary.

¶2.  Heavy rains since July 7 have affected 10,900 households in the 
Khartoum area, according to USAID and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs).  On July 11, teams of USAID, U.N., NGO, and Khartoum State 
representatives assessed rain-related damage in Jebel Aulia and Mayo 
internally displaced person (IDP) camps and the Omdawaban and Elafon 
neighborhoods of Khartoum. In Jebel Aulia, approximately 5,200 
households were affected; in Mayo, approximately 1,250 households 
were affected; and on the eastern bank of the Blue Nile River in 
Omdawaban and Elafon, 4,450 households were affected.  Needs vary by 
area and include shelter materials, mosquito nets, blankets, food, 
and anti-malarial medication.  In Omdawaban and Elafon, Sudanese 
Civil Defense has provided 300 tents, 9 metric tons (MT) of sorghum, 
and additional food commodities valued at USD 10,000.  USAID and 
partners are awaiting the final results of the July 11 assessment to 
determine whether to provide additional assistance.  USAID partner 
CARE is prepared to provide emergency food commodities. 
Additionally, in coordination with the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) 
and the U.N. Joint Logistics Center (UNJLC), CARE is preparing to 
provide relief supplies in Jebel Aulia and Mayo IDP camps. 
 
¶3.  In Northern Kordofan State, conflicting reports indicate varying 
levels of damage in six locations:  Shieken, Um Rwaba, Sodari, 
En-Nihud, Bara, and Gabrat el Shiekh.  A U.N. report states that 648 
houses are destroyed and 700 others are damaged; however, the same 
report states that more than 12,000 households are affected.  The 
federal and state governments have provided 1,000 plastic sheets, 
100 tents, 500 blankets, and 1,000 sacks of sorghum in each of the 
six locations, the U.N. reported.  As the Northern Kordofan capital, 
El Obeid, is a key logistical hub for the country's relief 
operation, many supplies including food aid commodities are 
available within the state. 
 
¶4.  In White Nile State, USAID partner Adventist Development and 
Relief Agency (ADRA) reported that nearly 1,600 houses have been 
destroyed and nearly 1,000 additional households have sustained 
damage in Rabak, Kosti, and Tendelti towns due to heavy rains since 
June 30.   ADRA, other humanitarian agencies, and the Government of 
National Unity's (GNU) Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) are 
providing household supplies, food, and shelter materials to 1,000 
affected families in the state.  The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) 
is prepared to provide assistance pending completion of a second 
assessment in the area.  USAID staff report that these agencies 
appear to be adequately meeting the needs of the flood-affected 
population in White Nile State. 
 
¶5.  In Kassala State, heavy rains and flooding since July 5 have 
affected approximately 3,560 households, according to USAID 
partners.  The most affected area is Aroma town, 50 km north of 
Kassala town, according to the U.N. Resident Coordinator's Office. 
An interagency assessment on July 11 and 12 found the town severely 
damaged, and a slow government response coupled with continued rains 
in this rural area has raised possibility of a relocation of all 
8,000 town residents.  As an interim measure, the NGO GOAL has 
distributed 1,000 plastic sheets, 1,500 water containers, and 3,000 
sandbags to families in Aroma.  USAID partner the International 
Rescue Committee reported that 1,680 homes were damaged or destroyed 
in Kassala town, and 274 homes were destroyed in rural areas, 
including 237 in Togli village.  GOAL has distributed plastic 
sheeting and relief supplies to 150 households in Kassala town. 
UNICEF is replenishing supplies in its Kassala warehouse to respond 
to additional needs in the state.  WFP is providing a 15-day 
emergency ration to affected families in rural areas and conducting 
an assessment to determine additional needs.

¶6.  In Blue Nile State, heavy rains have affected 1,355 households 
in Tadamon and Geissan towns, according to U.N. agencies. 
Government and humanitarian organizations have provided food aid, 
supplies, and 3,000 insecticide-treated mosquito nets to affected 
families.  The U.N. Mission in Sudan is providing a helicopter for 
aerial assessments on July 13, as poor road conditions do not permit 
overland travel to affected areas of the state.

¶7.  Intensive rainfall between 50 and 175 millimeters in the 
Ethiopian and Eritrean highlands and projected heavy rains in 
Gedaref and Kassala states in the coming days are expected to cause 
the level of the Gash River to rise, potentially affecting Kassala 
town and Tokar, Red Sea State.  As of July 10, the Blue Nile water 
level was 1.75 meters below flooding level in Khartoum, according to 
the GNU HAC.  Government officials are concerned because the Blue 
Nile River is currently above the water level recorded on the same 
dates in 1988, when devastating floods occurred. 
 
¶8.  U.N. and NGO partners report that the government and 
humanitarian community are currently meeting needs.  The GNU HAC is 
issuing a regular Flood Watch Update and has requested a coordinated 
humanitarian response throughout the rainy season, which typically 
lasts until September in northern Sudan.  State-level committees are 
meeting to ensure a coordinated response at the local level.  USAID 
is monitoring the situation and is prepared to respond should 
additional assistance be necessary.
