SUBJECT:  DESIGNATION OF DEFENSE ATTACHE FOR SUDANESE 
  EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On September 27, CDA met with MFA on a number of issues, 
including the fact that post's new Defense Liaison Officer has been 
waiting approval of his entry visa for Sudan for more than four 
months.  During the discussion, the MFA expressed interest in 
assigning a Defense Attache to the Sudanese Embassy in Washington. 
Post queries what would be required for Department review and 
approval of such a request.  Post would support Department approval 
of the designation of a Sudanese military attache in Washington on 
the basis of reciprocity. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) FYI:  There are currently ten U.S. military officers 
attached to our embassy in Khartoum, and the role they play is a 
critical one in achieving USG objectives.
