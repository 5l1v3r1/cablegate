¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On August 11, JEM fighters on Jebel Moon fired on 
a UNAMID helicopter which they thought was a GoS aircraft.  JEM 
later released a press statement acknowledging its error, but both 
in this statement and in a contact with the field commander 
responsible for the unit, JEM attempted to shift blame.  A 
UNAMID-JEM meeting to discuss the event is scheduled for March 16. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
JEM FIRES ON UNAMID HELICOPTER 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶2.  (SBU)  On August 11, at approximately 12:30 local time, a UNAMID 
MI8 helicopter carrying 5 people came under fire while traveling 
from EL Geneina to Kulbus.  According to UN reports, the helicopter 
was flying at 6500 feet when the pilot heard shots "from a heavy 
weapon" directed at the aircraft.  The helicopter returned to El 
Geneina and landed safely at 12:50.  UN contacts contacted JEM 
commanders in the area who admitted that they fired on a white 
helicopter, believing it to be a GoS aircraft. 
 
 
PRESS STATEMENT 
- - - - - - - - - - 
¶3.  (SBU)  Late on August 11, JEM released a press statement in 
Arabic from Ahmed Hussein, JEM's spokesman currently visiting the 
U.S.  The statement reports that JEM seriously regrets shooting at 
the UNAMID helicopter labeling it as an "unintentional mistake that 
fortunately did not lead to any loss of life."  The statement added 
that JEM fighters believed that the helicopter "belonged to the 
regime of Khartoum, as they always bring their aircraft and fire at 
peaceful villages and civilians."  The statement argues that UNAMID 
did not inform JEM of its flight plans, nor receive permission from 
JEM for the travel.  "Any plane that flys over JEM-controlled areas 
without permission or advance warning, will be vulnerable to 
attack," notes the statement.  It adds that JEM has repeatedly told 
the UN-AU hybrid forces in writing and verbally the importance of 
having a channel of communication between the two parties, so that 
such mistakes can be avoided.  According to the statement, JEM 
supports UNAMID and its desire to protect civilians.  Finally, the 
statement condemns the regime in Khartoum, "which creates this tense 
atmosphere in Darfur, and uses hired mercenary crews."  It also 
alleges that the GOS paints its planes the same color as the UN's 
aircraft, and puts the same symbols on them, as an intentional 
maneuver to confuse the rebels.  The statement ends saying that 
there should be a military no-fly zone in Darfur. 
 
FIELD COMMANDER SHIFTS BLAME 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶4.  (SBU)  On August 14, JEM's Deputy Field Commander, Suliman 
Sandal  (located in Jebel Moon) told poloff via satellite phone that 
his forces did accidentally fire on a UNAMID aircraft on August 11 
with an anti-aircraft gun.  (Sandal would not disclose what exact 
type of weapon was used in the attack.)  Sandal blamed the mistake 
on poor coordination from UNAMID, an absence of JEM representatives 
at UNAMID, and SAF's continued use of similar models, colors, and 
markings of UNAMID aircraft.  Sandal stated that on August 16, a 
group of senior UNAMID leaders will travel to an undisclosed 
location to discuss the incident with JEM. 
 
"SAF HAD BOMBED JEM POSITIONS THREE TIMES THIS WEEK" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶5.  (SBU)  Sandal said SAF had bombed and attacked rebel-held Jebel 
Moon three times in the last week using Antonovs and helicopters, 
and that they anticipated further attacks the day of the incident. 
Sandal stressed that although he welcomes UNAMID's presence, JEM is 
not a signatory to the DPA, and he added it is important for UNAMID 
to recognize there is an ongoing war with the GoS.  He stated that 
UNAMID should "wake up" to this and carefully coordinate its travel 
with JEM field commanders. 
 
GoS INTERESTED IN WAR, NOT NEGOTIATIONS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶6.  (SBU)  According to Sandal, the GoS has intensified its military 
attacks on JEM rebel positions, and JEM "is preparing ourselves for 
war, as the government is preparing itself."  He called President 
Bashir's Darfur initiative "just a maneuver following the ICC 
proceedings."  Sandal stated that Bashir's focus should not be on 
outreach to Darfuri civil society, but to the rebel movements, as 
"Peace should be made between the warring parties, not the people 
sitting in the town." 
 
JEM AND GOS ARE THE ONLY PLAYERS, SAYS COMMANDER 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶7.  (SBU)  Sandal added that "JEM is the only movement that has 
taken the government on in a direct fight."  Sandal called the 
 
KHARTOUM 00001230  002 OF 002 
 
 
government's outreach "propaganda," saying "The government's desire 
is not peace but to continue war and completely destroy JEM." 
Sandal claimed that despite the rainy season, the GoS has been 
training and mobilizing its soldiers, janjaweed, and former rebel 
movements now aligned with the government.  Sandal said that 
movements such as SLA/Free Will and the Peace Wing (movements who 
entered the DPA through signing a declaration of commitment (DOC)) 
have now been incorporated into the government's military apparatus 
(this is something that the GOS freely admits) and are attacking JEM 
positions.  Sandal ended the conversation reiterating JEM's regret 
over the incident and its promise to work closely with UNAMID to 
resolve the matter. 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - 
¶8.  (SBU)  Although JEM has accepted responsibility for the attack, 
it has attempted to shift the blame for this egregious violation. 
This and Sandal's attempt to portray the Darfur conflict as a matter 
best left between the GoS and JEM are both unacceptable but not 
surprising considering that the Khartoum regime and JEM have the 
same origin in Sudan's Islamist movement.  Post will follow up with 
JEM and UNAMID following their June 14 meeting. END COMMMENT.
