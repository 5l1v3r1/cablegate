¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Elements of the new Abyei Administration, 
notably on the security side, are taking shape, but Abyei Roadmap 
implementation remains constrained by the lack of a functioning 
civil administration.  The local government should begin receiving 
oil revenues (calculated by the Finance Ministry to now total around 
US$17 million) when the administration starts to operate.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
Components of Abyei Administration Falling Into Place

¶2.  (SBU) On September 10, new UNMIS Political Affairs Chief Muin 
Shrim told emboffs that the elements of the new Abyei Administration 
are gradually falling into place, although more needs to be done, 
and quickly.  According to Shrim, SAF and SPLA have completed their 
mutual withdrawals from the Abyei region, with the exception of an 
SAF unit located at Difra, an oil-field site, for security.  This 
unit should be able to depart as soon as the new Abyei Joint 
Integrated Unit (JIU) becomes fully operational and is capable of 
providing oilfield security.  He described the JIU as functional. 
(Note:  Although the Abyei JIU now is fully manned and is reported 
to have coalesced into a cohesive unit, it continues to be 
critically short of the equipment required to be able to perform its 
security role, especially transport (ref. A).  End note.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Shrim reported that the Joint Integrated Police Unit 
(JIPU) has now completed the training program provided by UNMIS, but 
still lacks infrastructure (e.g., police stations, vehicles) and 
equipment.  He said the SPLM component of the JIPU also is 
under-strength and that recruiting in the south is lagging.  The 
biggest challenge facing the JIPU, however, is the lack of an Abyei 
civil administration, putting judiciary responsibilities on the JIPU 
that a police force should not have to shoulder. 
 
Civil Administration Needed ASAP 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶4.  (SBU) Shrim said that the critical need now is for the new civil 
administration to start operating as soon as possible.  Although 
Abyei Administrator Arop Mayak and Deputy Rahama al-Nour have been 
appointed (ref. B), the district still lacks a Council and 
administrative Directors.  Shrim understood that although Mayak and 
al-Nour have submitted a list of candidates for these posts to the 
Presidency, they have yet to be confirmed. (The Presidency is 
meeting on September 14 to discuss this and other matters). 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Shrim said that Administrator Arop Mayak had been in Abyei 
the previous day, accompanied by an armed body guard of eight. 
Shrim said that UNMIS had warned Mayak that such a show of armed 
forces was inappropriate and could further inflame tensions in the 
region.  (Note.  The situation in Abyei began to deteriorate in the 
spring, when the SPLM's unilaterally appointed administrator Edward 
Lino arrived in town with a "bodyguard" of about 100 heavily armed 
SPLA troops, provoking (or providing a excuse) the SAF to reinforce 
its presence in the area.  End note.) 
 
Oil-Revenue Transfers Await Civil Administration

¶6.  (SBU) On September 7, Norwegian Embassy oil advisor Anders 
Hannevik told econoff that the Ministry of Finance has calculated 
the amount of oil revenues due to the Abyei Administration under the 
terms of Abyei Roadmap agreement.  Hannevik said that the MinFin is 
calculating the transfers from the date of the agreement, June 8, 
amounting now to approximately US$17 million.  Hannevik did not know 
whether any funds had actually been transferred.  Shrim also was 
unaware of any revenues having been deposited, but doubted that this 
would happen until the civil administration is in place.  He 
remarked that this is another reason why the civil administration 
needs to be put in place quickly. 
 
Comment 
- - - - 
¶7.  (SBU) Shrim recently took up his new position of UNMIS Pol 
Chief, after serving as JMST political chief.  He is still very much 
learning his new portfolio.  His relatively upbeat assessment of 
Abyei administration progress is good news.  However, as he notes, 
the critical need now is for the functioning civil administration 
that Abyei has lacked for three years.  It remains to be seen 
whether the Presidency can resist playing politics with Mayak's 
slate of appointments and approves the body of his administration 
quickly and whether urgently needed equipment can be provided - and 
allowed by Khartoum - for the JIU and JIPU.
