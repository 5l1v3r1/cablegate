SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: DEFENSE MINISTER CLAIMS 24 JEWISH GROUPS 
INCITE CONFLICT IN DARFUR 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  On July 26 the Arabic pro-government "Al-Rai' 
Al-Aam" reprinted an interview with Sudanese Minister of Defense 
Abdelrahim Hussein in which he claims that 24 Jewish organizations 
are provoking the conflict in Darfur.  In the article, reprinted 
from an earlier interview from the influential Saudi newspaper 
"Al-Ukaz," Hussein claims "holocaust groups" have penetrated tribes 
in Darfur, carried out a propaganda campaign, and used their 
political and financial power to influence decision makers.  He also 
alleges that the U.S. wants to turn Sudan into another Iraq or 
Afghanistan.  The Saudis invited Hussein on this official visit 
following by only a few days a similar visit by Minni Minnawi, the 
Senior Assistant to President Bashir.  END SUMMARY.

U.S. WANTS SUDAN TO BE ANOTHER IRAQ 
----------------------------------- 
¶2.  (U)  In his interview, Hussein said that foreign countries have 
used rebel movements in Darfur for their own purposes.  He says 
there are now about 18 rebel factions that "alien countries use to 
meet their objectives."  According to Hussein, although the West was 
originally supportive of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), "now the 
ones who are ruining the DPA are in Paris, London and the United 
States." According to Hussein, these countries "do not want 
stability in Darfur, but they would like to see Sudan as another 
Iraq or Afghanistan." 
 
¶3.  (U)  He added that the West has intentionally distorted the 
facts in Darfur, alleging that the U.S. and U.K. issue false reports 
which contradict real facts.  He then rhetorically asks "When did 
America meddle and resolve a problem? When did America intervene and 
succeed? See what is happening in Iraq.  It is far better ten years 
ago than today. Is Afghanistan more peaceful than before?   Did 
America stabilize Somalia?"

JEWS CREATING CONFLICT 
---------------------- 
¶4.  (U)  According to the article, Hussein believes that there are 
more than 24 Jewish groups dividing and motivating the rebels in 
Darfur.  He said that "holocaust groups" carry out a propaganda 
campaign in Darfur.  He further claimed that these Jewish groups 
provide financial and political support, especially through "their 
control of the media and their influence in the highest circles in 
America and Britain."   When asked how these Jewish organizations 
were able to penetrate tribal leadership, Hussein responded, "They 
exploit inter-tribal conflicts which existed for about 200 years. 
These conflicts could have been resolved by tribal elders' 
efforts." 
 
¶5.  (U)  In this interview Hussein also addresses military 
cooperation with China, the difference between a hybrid force and a 
"mixed force," and the 2009 elections and 2011 referendum.
