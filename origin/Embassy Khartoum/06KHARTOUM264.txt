GOVERNMENT PROVOCATION 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) On February 2, an angry crowd of approximately 100 
students surrounded the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) and 
Agencies Coordinating Together (ACT)/CARITAS (which houses 
Norwegian NGOs) compounds in Nyala, South Darfur, and stoned 
several vehicles at 10:00 in the morning.  The NGO staff were 
able to find shelter in nearby offices of the UN and/or NGOs; 
none was injured.  The protest is linked to the recent 
controversy over the publication by a Danish publication of 
cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed in a derogatory 
manner.  Following the event, the UN broadcast a message 
advising all NGOs to remain inside their compounds due to 
tensions in town.  USAID notes that all Darfur Field Office 
personnel are accounted for and safe. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The UN Field Security Coordination Office in 
Khartoum issued a security advisory on the afternoon of 
February 2 directing staff to minimize non-essential 
movement, maintain radio contact, avoid the city center and 
demonstrations, and carry UN identification cards at all 
times.  The office also noted that additional demonstrations 
are expected following Friday prayers. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to the February 2 edition of Arabic 
language daily newspaper Al-Watan, an organization called 
"Forum Defending Prophet Mohamed" has asked Muslims to 
participate in a February 3 "mosques demonstration" to 
denounce Norwegian and Danish publications depicting the 
Prophet disparagingly.  The demonstrations are to be followed 
by a march to the UN offices; the protesters are asked to 
call for the expulsion of Norwegian and Danish organizations 
from Sudan. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On January 31, according the government Sudan News 
Agency (SUNA) stated that President Bashir had instructed the 
Ministry of Defense to reject a request to visit Sudan by the 
Danish Minister of Defense due to the derogatory cartoons. 
He affirmed that no Danish officials would be permitted to 
visit Sudan until the Danish government issued an apology to 
the Islamic world.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
reportedly urged Sudanese companies to cease dealings and 
financial transactions immediately with Danish companies in 
protest.  The article concluded by mentioning that there is 
no diplomatic representation between Denmark and Sudan. 
 
¶5. (SBU) This incident hearkens to the January 17 anti-West 
protest rally in El Fasher, wherein reportedly 2,000 youths 
demonstrated in front of the African Union Mission in Sudan 
(AMIS) compound.  The North Darfur governor addressed the 
crowd, denouncing efforts to deploy international forces in 
Darfur.  The occasion included the burning of U.S. and UN 
flags. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment:  The Danish cartoon incident has provided 
the opportunity for anti-Western protest in Darfur, at a time 
of heightened Sudanese sensitivities with regard to their 
sovereignty:  blaming the West (U.S.) for Sudan's 
non-accession to the AU presidency; Kofi Annan's statements 
about needing much more robust peacekeeping (read 
"internationalization") in Darfur; and the beginning of 
serious planning for AMIS-UN rehatting.  The recent incident 
in Darfur against the Danish NGO was no doubt instigated by 
the government.  We will remain vigilant to any increase in 
violence, and will issue a warden notice, considering the 
possibility of inflammatory statements from the mosques on 
Friday.
