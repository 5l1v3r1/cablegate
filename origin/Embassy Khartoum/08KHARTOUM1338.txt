¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  SPLA morale and discipline are sagging as 
soldiers face arrears in pay averaging two months, while some troops 
reportedly have not been paid during the past  six months.  With 
2008 funds already exhausted because of corruption and cost 
overruns, there seems little prospect for relief in the near future. 
 The pay crisis also calls into question the GoSS' discipline and 
capacity to keep spending within budgetary targets.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Despite a July 12 commitment by GOSS Finance Minister Kuol 
Mawien to seek an extraordinary $250 million budget supplemental for 
the SPLA, the South's military rank and file now average a two-month 
delay in salary payments as of August 30.  Outlying division 
commanders report to the SPLA's payroll chief in Juba that select 
units under them have not been paid in as many as six months.  USG 
contract personnel witnessed a recent exchange between one such 
division commander and the paymaster.  The latter expressed surprise 
at the length of the delay, and promised to get an investigation get 
underway. Significantly, he could not promise remedial compensation 
would be offered, however.  The budget supplemental, the first to be 
considered by the Southern Sudan Legislative Assembly in its 
history, has yet to be tabled for parliament's consideration. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In June, the SPLA initiated an unannounced 10 percent 
salary reduction for all ranks.  In the absence of any transparent 
explanation by the SPLA's senior commanders, the surprise directive 
has been implemented inconsistently.  Some units report no impact, 
while others report suffering a greater than 10 percent deduction, 
fueling frustration within the ranks.  One SPLA colonel grumbled to 
a USG contractor: "Mathok probably did not get his pay cut," 
referring to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Administration, the 
SPLA's second most senior officer.  The pay-reduction order followed 
SPLA Chief of General Staff Oyai Deng Ajak's May admission to ConGen 
Juba PolOff that the SPLA will have exhausted its entire 2008 
payroll by the end of July (ref. a).  What was publicized belatedly 
as an "interim measure" now has taken on an aura of permanence. 
Rumors are circulating at Bilfam (the SPLA's Interim General 
Headquarters in Juba) that some troops will not receive any pay for 
the month of September. 
 
¶4. (SBU) SPLA Chief of General Staff Oyai Deng Ajak told ConGen 
PolOff that in July the Ministry of Finance had absolved the SPLA of 
responsibility for the majority of military's budget overruns. 
However, this reprieve has not permitted the SPLA to lift the 
financial burden off the back of its troops.  GOSS President Salva 
Kiir Mayardit publicly pleaded for understanding and patience in an 
extraordinary address to approximately 2,000 Juba-based troops in 
mid-August.  The President tied the SPLA's continuing financial 
predicament to strains caused by the integration of an unexpectedly 
high number of formerly non-aligned militias.  SPLA Commanders 
staffing the infantry training school in Malou, where the SPLA runs 
the bulk of its debriefing and DDR programming, reported 
approximately 600 new "militia colonels" had arrived at the facility 
for integration interviews. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Despite Kiir's August address, tensions continue.  Unable 
to identify any stop-gap revenue source, the SPLA is targeting 
"areas of insecurity" within its ranks in order to maintain 
discipline.  In Unity State, the SPLA, supported by the Southern 
Sudan Police Service and the SPLA contingent of that state's Joint 
Integrated Unit, seized "unauthorized weaponry" in a house-to-house 
search of the residences of SPLA personnel the week of August 10. 
JIU Commander Thomas Cirillo told ConGen PolOff August 29 that a 
similar campaign was being considered for Juba, following the 
broad-daylight skirmish, on August 21, between ethnic Mundari and 
Nuer SPLA soldiers in  the center of Juba town. According to 
Cirillo, SPLA Military Police investigating the incident believe the 
dispute was sparked by two soldiers bragging over their receipt of 
pay. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment:  In addition to the obvious impact on SPLA 
cohesion, the pay arrearages call into question once more the GoSS' 
financial management capacity.  The vast bulk of the GoSS budget is 
devoted to salaries, and much of that (49 percent) is allocated to 
the SPLA.   The 2008 budget (ref b.) was supposed to rein in 
spending, avoid the budgetary (near) train wreck that occurred in 
2007, and get the GoSS on the path to fiscal responsibility.  The 
SPLA's inability to meet its basic payroll obligations in 2008 
suggests that the GOSS has a long way to go in managing its budget 
and payroll.
