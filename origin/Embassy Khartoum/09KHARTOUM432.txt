SUBJECT: KHARTOUM EAC CONVENES ON MARCH 27 
 
¶1.  (SBU) CDA Fernandez convened a core Emergency Action Committee (EAC) meeting on Friday, March 27, to review the current security situation in Sudan after international and local media reported that 
the Israeli Air Force conducted airstrikes in January and February against suspected arms smugglers in eastern Sudan.  These reports said the latter were allegedly transporting weapons to Hamas in Gaza.  The DCM, POL, A/MGT, DLO, IMO, CONS, and RSO were in attendance. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The CDA informed the core EAC that he spoke to MFA Under Secretary Mutrif Siddiq on the evening of March 26, and again on the morning of March 27.  U/S Siddiq insisted the Sudanese Government wants to "play this down," and that Minister for Transportation Mubarak Mabrook Saleem was not speaking on behalf of the Government of Sudan when he accused the United States of involvement.  U/S Siddiq also informed the CDA that President Bashir and Foreign Minister Deng Alor have reiterated their support for the upcoming visit of Special Envoy Gration.  CDA Fernandez reminded Siddiq of the Government of Sudan's (GOS) responsibility to protect the Embassy and Mission personnel.  Siddiq responded that the GOS is monitoring the situation carefully, and does not want to see an escalation of anti-U.S. rhetoric in response to this story. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Although the Embassy has received the strongest assurances from the GOS on this matter, local press reports have launched incendiary attacks against Israel in which the U.S. has also been targeted.  The front page of one pro-regime newspaper labels the incident as a "Zionist attack on Sudan," and implies that the United States was either behind the attack or assisted it in some way. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The core EAC reevaluated the Embassy's security posture. The RSO sent SMS messages to Mission personnel on the evening of March 26 reminding staff to increase their security awareness, 
maintain a low profile, and immediately report any suspicious activity or possible surveillance.  The Embassy is also carefully monitoring Friday prayer sermons for possible anti-American rhetoric.  One Mission employee and one family member also depart this weekend under authorized departure.  This will reduce the number of official Americans currently in Khartoum to 75.  Further developments will be reported via septel.
