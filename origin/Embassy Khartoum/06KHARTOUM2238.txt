Ref:  State 148307 
 
¶1.  In response to reftel, Embassy Khartoum regrets to advise that 
proposed October 5-10 travel to El Geneina in reftel is not 
permissible due to security conditions. 
 
¶2.  Embassy Khartoum notes that the September 30 end of the mandate 
of the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), the ongoing military 
engagement in North Darfur State, decreasing humanitarian access, 
and concerns about Chad-Sudan border crossings by third country 
nationals render proposed travel inadvisable.
