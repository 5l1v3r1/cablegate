¶1.  ACCORDING TO SUDAN'S ENGLISH LANGUAGE WEEKLY "NEW 
HORIZON," SUDAN'S HEAD OF STATE, GENERAL OMAR AL BASHIR, 
HAS PUBLICLY ENDORSED THE 1983 SEPTEMBER LAWS.  PROVIDING 
FOR CORPORAL PUNISHMENT KNOWN AS "HUDUD," THE SEPTEMBER 
LAWS ARE ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS OF 
SUDANESE SOCIETY AND JURISPRUDENCE.  ALTHOUGH PRECEDING 
THE SEPTEMBER LAWS, JOHN GARANG'S REBELLION IN MARCH 1983 
CAME IN PART AS A RESULT OF THEN PRESIDENT NIMEIRI'S 
TREND TOWARD ISLAMICIZATION.  HUDUD PUNISHMENTS, ALTHOUGH 
HANDED DOWN, HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED SINCE NIMEIRI'S 
OVERTHROW IN 1985, AND THE ROLE OF SHARIA REMAINS A MAJOR 
SYMBOL IN THE CONTINUING CIVIL WAR. 
 
¶2.  COMMENT:  BASHIR'S ENDORSEMENT OF THE SEPTEMBER LAWS 
COULD LEAD TO IMPLEMENTATION OF HUDUD PUNISHMENTS.  IT 
WILL CERTAINLY LEAD TO A FURTHER ESTRANGEMENT FROM THE 
SOUTH (IF THAT IS POSSIBLE).  IN ADDITION, BASHIR'S 
ANNOUNCEMENT COULD LEAD TO DIFFICULTIES IN SUDAN'S UNITY 
PLANS WITH LIBYA.  DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO KHARTOUM 
QADHAFI WAS VERY CRITICAL OF SHARIA AND ALLEGEDLY 
INTIMIDATED BASHIR INTO NOT ENDORSING SHARIA AT THAT TIME 
(REFTELS).
