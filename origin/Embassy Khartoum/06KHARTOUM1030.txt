SUBJECT:  Update on Geraida Situation 
 
Ref:  Khartoum 00985 
 
¶1. (SBU) The situation in Geraida appears to have calmed 
since reftel of April 25; it appears the SAF has stopped 
its offensive.  The USAID Darfur Field Office states that 
it has not received further reports of hostilities, and 
noted that a UN OCHA assessment mission plans to travel 
to Geraida later this week.  The AU has been more active: 
the Sector commander flew out to talk to SLA Field 
Commander Shorba and learned that the SLA opposes a cease- 
fire in the area and intends to re-take the villages lost 
to the SAF in the past few days. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The sector commander also met the SAF commander 
in Joghana.  The village is in good shape and has not 
been burned.  Villagers told military observers that the 
SAF attacked the village on April 23-25, and then 
withdrew to allow the jinjaweed to enter and loot on 
April 26.  The SAF officer acknowledged to the AU that 
jinjaweed militias had looted Joghana. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The following paragraphs are from AMIS reporting 
and provide all we have on Geraida: 
 
-- On April 26 there were unverified reports that at 1400 
local time a white Antonov plane and 2 helicopter 
gunships were observed over-flying the area east of Dito 
village; 
 
-- On April 27, a delegation from Joghana reported to 
AMIS personnel that inhabitants of Joghana fled their 
homes during the recent fighting between theGOS and the 
SLA and were now living in slums.  He alleged that the 
jinjaweed killed 3 men on April 26 along the road to 
Joghana and burned over 300 dwellings.  They reported 
that the residents tried to return to Joghana, but 
jinjaweed who were surrounding the village fired gunshots 
at them.  They informed the Military Group Site officers 
that the village of Mukabesha and Beli Akara had been 
attacked also.  They alleged that the GOS used three 
helicopter gunships and an Antonov with about 20 vehicles 
during that attack.  Observers reported the same day that 
the SAF had three attack helicopters based at Nyala 
airfield; 
 
-- On April 28, AMIS reported that several people from 
Geraida conducted a peaceful demonstration at the 
Military Group Site helipad and demanded the immediate 
intervention of the UN, human rights organizations, non- 
governmental organizations, the International Court of 
Justice, and donors to stop what they called genocide 
against the citizens.  They requested the UN Secretary 
General to condemn the use of the Antonov aircraft and 
helicopter gunships to attack villages and civilians. 
They also complained that AMIS had failed to provide the 
protection they needed and therefore the UN should take 
over.  They alleged that the GOS had surrounded them from 
Donkey Alkhair, Donkey Diressa, Dito, Joghana, and 
Sergila.  They claimed that AMIS in Geraida would witness 
the genocide that awaits them.  The Military Group Site 
conducted a security assessment and verification patrol 
to Joghana village, where they met Lt. Uma Dumura Asan 
Bhashr, the Deputy Commander of the GOS in Joghana, who 
prevented the patrol from entering the village.  AMIS 
told the group that the security situation was unstable 
and unsafe.  The AMIS patrol observed some burned houses 
and was told that the fire was started by a bomb that was 
used by the SLA.  The commander of the GOS troops stated 
that the mission of the GOS forces was to open the Nyala 
- Buram road; and 
 
-- Fighting was reported to be going on in Dagama 
village.  This has forced the people of that village to 
flee to Geraida.  Internally displaced persons have 
continued to arrive in Geraida; they are settling in the 
northeastern side of the Military Group Site in Geraida. 
A humanitarian crisis has befallen Geraida, and urgent 
assistance is required.
