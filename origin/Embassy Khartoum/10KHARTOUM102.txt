¶1. (SBU) Summary: The January 5 killing of Sudan Liberation 
Army/Abdul Wahid (SLA/AW) faction Commander Abdalla Bakr (reftel) 
has led to sporadic infighting within the movement, according to 
unconfirmed reports out of Jebel Marra.  Meanwhile, elements of the 
SLA/AW faction attacked the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) in Golo on 
January 13 but failed to capture the town, according to UN and 
rebel sources.  Offices of the Danish Refugee Council in Golo were 
looted during the hostilities.  UNAMID has appealed to the 
conflicting parties to allow an investigative patrol team to visit 
the area.  Meanwhile in North Darfur, a SAF force allegedly 
attacked a Fur village east of Ain Siro, killing civilians and 
looting property.  The motive of the attack is unknown. End 
Summary.

KILLING SPARKS INFIGHTING AMONG SLA/AW 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) The killing of SLA/AW Commander Abdalla Bakr on January 5 
(reftel) has resulted in sporadic infighting within the movement, 
according to unconfirmed reports out of Jebel Marra.  UNAMID 
received information that on January 12, a group loyal to SLA 
Chairman Abdul Wahid Al Nur attacked the position of soldiers 
aligned with SLA/AW General Commander Gaddura in Kuturun, 
approximately 15 km east of Nertiti.  The resulting clash is said 
to have resulted in one dead and four wounded. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Speaking to emboff on January 13, SLA/AW Commander Hassan 
Yousif addressed the source of tension within SLA/AW.  He asserted 
that like the deceased Abdalla Bakr, most SLA/AW commanders are in 
favor of rebel unification efforts supported by U.S. Special Envoy 
to Sudan (SE) Scott Gration, as well greater engagement with the 
international community.  Those who oppose these efforts are 
largely relatives of SLA/AW Chairman Abdul Wahid Al Nur and 
constitute a minority, he said.  He urged renewed pressure on the 
Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) to release detained SLA/AW 
Chief of Staff Yousif Ahmed Yousif, known as Karjakola. (Note: 
Several other SLA/AW Commanders, including Suleiman Marajan and 
Musa Morni, also urged the release of Karjakola. End Note.)

SLA/AW ATTACKS SAF IN GOLO, FAILS TO CAPTURE TOWN

¶4. (SBU) On January 13, SLM/AW forces led by Ezhak Qui, an SLA/AW 
Commander loyal to Abdel Wahid, attacked the Sudan Armed Forces 
(SAF) in Golo (60 km northeast of Nertiti), according to UN and 
rebel sources.  Government of Sudan (GoS) Antonov aircraft later 
bombarded the vicinity of Golo, and the fighting reportedly 
subsided in the afternoon.  No details on casualties or 
displacement have emerged, though on January14 UNAMID Spokesman 
Noureddine Mezni appealed to the conflicting parties to allow a 
UNAMID investigative patrol team to the area. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) While it appears that SLA/AW forces may have pushed the 
SAF out of Golo for a short period on January 13, conflicting 
information has emerged as to whether they successfully captured 
the town. Speaking to emboff via satellite phone on January 15, 
SLA/AW Commander Osman Yousif claimed that his movement still 
maintained a presence in Golo, despite SAF aerial bombardment. Yet 
SLA/AW Commander Hassan Yousif dismissed such claims.  He told 
emboff that the SAF retained control of Golo, despite attempts by 
elements of SLA/AW to attack the SAF garrison there.

¶6. (SBU) During the hostilities in Golo on January 13, a group of 
armed men broke into the office of the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) 
and stole the DRC's sole vehicle, as well as their satellite phones 
and office equipment, according to the UN Department of Safety and 
Security (UNDSS). GoS police visited the office of the DRC shortly 
thereafter, and assured them the attack by SLA/AW had been repulsed 
and that a temporary calm had been restored.  On January 13-14, 
approximately 30 SAF vehicles with armed personnel on board were 
seen leaving Geneina toward East Jebel Marra, according to UN 
sources, presumably to provide reinforcement for Golo.  SLA/AW 
Commander Osman Yousif also told emboff that SAF troops were 
gathering in Khor Ramala, coming from the direction of Geneina, as 
well as in Malam.

SAF ATTACKS FUR VILLAGE IN NORTH DARFUR 
 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) Rebel sources reported that on January 15, a SAF force 
comprised of nine vehicles attacked the area of Furug, a primarily 
Fur village east of Ain Siro.  The attack was said to be organized 
by an Arab SAF Commander, Lt. Col. Abdel Elah Bango, and reportedly 
resulted in the death of over a dozen civilians with many more 
injured. Numerous camels and donkeys were also said to be killed or 
taken.  The motive of the attack is not known. According to UNDSS, 
on January 16 three NGO staff members on their way from Ain Siro to 
Kutum were detained in Mastria (27 km North of Kutum) by SLA/AW 
forces, allegedly for protective reasons as a result of the 
fighting in Furug. When contacted, the local SLA/AW commander 
stated the staff will be released no later than January 19. 
 
 
 
¶8. (SBU) Comment: SLA/AW has traditionally held purely defensive 
positions in Jebel Marra, making the attack on Golo somewhat of a 
surprise.  SLA/AW is said to be weak in military and logistical 
equipment, so the attack may have been motivated by material gain; 
the looting of NGO offices in Golo would seem to support this 
premise.  The Golo attack is also the final nail in the coffin for 
the oft-violated 2004 N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement; prior to this 
attack, SLA/AW is the only party which could conceivably claim to 
be honoring it.  As for the reported SAF attack near Ain Siro, if 
true, it may have been carried out in retaliation for SLA/AW 
aggression in Golo.  End Comment.
