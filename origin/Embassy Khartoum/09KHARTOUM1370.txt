¶1. (SBU) Summary: On December 8, Sudan People's Liberation Movement 
(SPLM) Head of Northern Sector Yasir Arman described how several 
Government of Sudan (GOS) junior police officers "beat him with 
their boots" and a police baton while he was in police custody on 
December 7.  Arman stated he received injuries to his head, legs and 
chest for which he sought medical treatment.  Arman stated that 
others detained in various locations suffered worse injuries, 
including broken bones.  The UN affirmed that 146 people had been 
arrested in Omdurman on December 7, while an additional 120 had been 
arrested in the northern Sudan cities of Wad Madani, El Obeid and El 
Hasahisa.  All were released the following morning.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On December 8, a visiting delegation from the U.S. 
Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) met with 
SPLM's Head of Northern Sector Yasir Arman following his detention 
the previous day by GOS security forces (reftels).  Accompanying 
Arman were Government of National Unity (GNU) Members of Parliament 
(MPs) Salwa Adam and Malone Mayok, who also took part in the 
December 7 protests. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Arman told the USCIRF delegation and poloff that he and 12 
to 15 other MPs arrived at the National Assembly for their planned 
protest at approximately 8:15 a.m. on December 7.  The National 
Assembly Speaker had agreed to receive them and accept their 
prepared memorandum, but the heavy GOS security presence prevented 
them from entering the building.  GOS police forces proceeded to 
take Malone Mayok into a police vehicle, which Arman protested 
vigorously due to standard GNU immunity granted to all MPs. Arman 
said it was then that he and SPLM Secretary General Pagan Amun were 
also taken to the police station. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Arman noted that there was no struggle or scuffling up to 
that point, but events took a turn for the worse when police 
attempted to search the MPs at the police station, and the MPs 
refused.  Arman stated he was then taken into the station's bathroom 
where several junior officers "beat him with their boots" and a 
"plastic stick" on his legs, head and chest.  (Note: Arman is most 
likely referring to a hard rubber police baton commonly used in 
Sudan.  End note.)  He showed USCIRF three bruises on his right leg. 
 Arman stated that his suit was also torn during the beating. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Arman requested that he be taken to a local hospital, which 
he stated took a full record of his injuries, including photographs. 
 After his examination, Arman returned to the police station and was 
released in the late afternoon.  Salma Adam also told the USCIRF 
delegation that she was beaten on the arms, and observers noted 
slight swelling on her right arm.  Arman further noted that other 
people arrested in various locations suffered more severe injuries 
from beatings, including broken bones.  Arman stated he would hold a 
press conference later in the day on December 8 for "the public 
record."  (Note: In speaking with the press on December 8, SPLM 
Secretary General Pagan Amun did not say that he had been beaten, 
but did say that Arman had been.  End note.)

UNMIS CONFIRMS ARRESTS, ALL RELEASED

¶6. (SBU) UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) Human Rights Officer-in-Charge 
Jose Maria Aranaz confirmed press reports that over 200 
demonstrators were arrested in northern Sudan on December 7. 
According to the latest figures gathered by the UN, Sudanese 
authorities arrested 146 people in Omdurman, and all of them were 
released by the morning of December 8.  Sudanese authorities 
arrested an additional 120 individuals in protests in Wad Medani, El 
Obeid and El Hasahisa, but the UN confirmed that all were released 
by the morning of December 8 as well.  UN representatives noted 
numerous bandaged demonstrators at the opposition parties' press 
conference in Omdurman on December 7, and said that three protesters 
were injured seriously during the protests in El Obeid and Wad 
Medani.  UNMIS Human Rights intends to follow up on the issue with 
the GOS Advisory Council on Human Rights this week. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment: While it is common for GOS security services to 
react in a heavy-handed fashion, this outlash against demonstrators 
engaged in a peaceful protest is significant.  In a moment of 
unusual candor, the MFA's acting Americas' Department Director told 
the DCM on December 8 that the "roughness by police" in response to 
the demonstrators had been "regrettable" and would "complicate the 
political situation."  The abuse of SPLM heavyweight Arman, 
apparently by junior police officers, may not have been particularly 
severe, but it is troublesome in that Arman is the SPLM's caucus 
 
KHARTOUM 00001370  002 OF 002 
 
 
leader in the National Assembly with guaranteed legal immunity as 
such, and a senior official in the junior partner in the GNU.  This 
incident will create a chill in the political climate as Sudan tries 
to move forward in the electoral cycle.  End comment.
