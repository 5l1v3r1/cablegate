¶1.  (SBU) SPLM Darfur Taskforce Member (DTF) Edward Lino informed 
ConGen PolOff that Musa Hilal will be arriving in Juba on December 
¶5.  Expected to spend at least two days in the South's capital, the 
Janjaweed leader will be meeting with a cross-section of 
newly-consolidated Darfur rebel movements and have separate 
discussions with the Taskforce.  Possible discussions with 
Government of Southern Sudan officials are on hold pending the 
interaction between Hilal and the United Resistance Front and Sudan 
Liberation Movement.  Lino termed the talks "a constructive dialogue 
focused on the future," and plans on encouraging the United Nations 
and African Union to delay movement of rebel groups back to Darfur 
(planned for later this week) until discussions with Hilal have 
concluded. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Hilal contacted DTF Chairman Clement Janda about the 
possibility of traveling to Juba in early November following 
positive readouts from the first round of consolidation talks. 
Janda emphasized that Hilal was free to travel throughout Sudan, and 
that he would be "welcomed to Juba with open arms if he came in the 
name of peace."  DTF members broached possibility of a 
Hilal-Movements meeting with rebel representatives last week.  Lino 
maintains no one has objected to such a meeting to date.  "This is 
how things happen in Sudan - we can be very open when we remain true 
to our roots. Musa is still very much a tribesman.  He has given his 
word that he will be open to dialogue, and I believe he will keep 
it." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Following Hilal's visit to Juba, Taskforce members will 
accompany URF and SLM members back to Darfur to observe their 
briefings to field commanders, emphasize the importance of 
unification, and secure SLM-Unity's agreement to include itself in 
further consolidation talks in Juba.  Lino anticipates a return to 
Juba approximately ten days after his Darfur deployment to renew 
smaller-level talks between URF, SLM, and SLM-Unity dedicated to 
selecting a negotiating team and issues-platform for the Sirte 
Process.  Lino optimistically spoke of utilizing the outcome Hilal's 
visit as an important foundation for a future Darfur-Darfur Dialogue 
and Consultation, and ensuring that any agreement entered into in 
Libya had broad-based support. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: The relative success of the SPLM's Darfur rebel 
reunification process has reached another milestone with Musa 
Hilal's visit. Long notorious as the best known of the feared 
Janjaweed, Hilal (and many Darfur Arab tribal leaders) is reportedly 
concerned about being made the convenient scapegoat for Khartoum's 
bloody policies in Darfur.  The SPLM's continued engagement on this 
issue will continue to raise hackles among National Congress Party 
(NCP) leaders who fear "convergence" of the two major challenges 
they face, Darfur and CPA, most of all. End comment.
