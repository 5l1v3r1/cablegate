SUBJECT:  Darfur:  UNDSS Update on Kulkul Area Bombings 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The UNDSS visited the Kulkul area of North Darfur 
on August 8; an estimated 40 bombs had struck the area during the 
period of approximately July 26 - August 7.  UNDSS estimates 20 
individuals died in the hostilities.  Despite the attacks, people 
were observed planting crops, and returning to villages from IDP 
camps to farm.  There are no reports of unexplained illnesses by 
either the populace or their livestock.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The El Fasher USAID Darfur Field Office Field Report of 
August 9 included the following items from the UNDSS security 
briefing of the same day.  These items involved the August 8 UNDSS 
visit to Kulkul, North Darfur, to follow up on the reports of aerial 
bombardments that started on July 26: 
 
-- UNDSS along with UNMAS traveled on August 8 to the Kulkul region 
to assess the humanitarian situation and interview the NRF 
leadership.  This travel went to the villages of Kulkul, Telbo, 
Hassan, Abu Sakin and Bombai.  There was evidence of aerial bombing 
and ground fighting, particularly in the villages of Telbo, Hassan, 
and Bobai with evidence of 12 bomb craters located in Hassan alone. 
In the village of Hassan, a family compound was destroyed and the 
resident woman head of the household killed.  The team reported that 
several UXOs were identified and UNMAS will be preparing plans to 
deal with them in the next few days.  This aerial bombardment began 
on approximately the 26th of July and ended with the aircraft 
reportedly being shot down on August 7.   Based on interviews with 
the villagers, UNDSS estimates there were about 20 combatants killed 
in action on both sides. 
 
-- UNDSS observed the following conditions in the Kulkul, Abu Sikin, 
Kafod, El Fasher rural areas.  Agricultural planting is ongoing and 
the resident population in the target area did not seem to be 
fleeing in the wake of the action.  The roads traveled were passable 
but certain key points were showing signs of deterioration from 
heavy rains.  The Sudanese Armed Forces buildup was limited to 
certain camps that were pre-designated as part of the Darfur Peace 
Agreement.  There was no commercial traffic on the roads traveled 
and evidence of this in the village markets was noted. 
 
-- Finally, UNDSS reported that it did not observe IDPs flowing 
south out of the war area, but did observe IDPs heading from the El 
Fasher camps back to their villages in the north to engage in 
agricultural activities.  These were mostly men, but also included 
some women.  UNDSS estimated that the total number observed was 
approximately 60. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  Initial contacts with humanitarian agencies 
operating in the area indicate no reports of unexplained illnesses 
among the resident population or livestock.  End comment.
