¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Media reporting appears to have combined two 
separate and unconfirmed incidents of fighting, mixing a significant 
element of speculation in an active campaign to discredit 
SLM/A-Minni Minawi forces.  Fighting reportedly broke out between 
SLM/A- Abdel Wahid and SLM-Minawi forces south of Korma June 30 to 
July 5, and between SLM/A-Minawi and G-19 forces north of Kutum in 
the vicinity of Birmaza and Um Sidir on July 9.  Neither UNDSS nor 
AMIS has been able to confirm the accuracy of any of the reports. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to the UNDSS Regional Security Officer (RSO), who 
has completed a preliminary investigation of fighting south of 
Korma, SLM/A-Wahid forces appear to have attacked several Zaghawa 
villages 40 km south of Tawila on June 30 and stole 400 head of 
livestock (reftels A and B).  Local SLM/A-Minawi forces retaliated 
the next day, attacking three villages (Dadi, Kiera, and Tungar) and 
retrieving their livestock plus some extra.  During his 
investigation, UNDSS RSO found three grave sites in Dadi with a 
reported seven bodies and one grave site with three bodies in Kiera. 
 His investigation indicated that there was limited fighting based 
on physical evidence such as shell casings and blood trails.  He 
also stated that representatives from both belligerents admitted to 
the fighting and the sequence of events.  SLM/A-Wahid forces 
indicated they have since withdrawn all of their forces to the south 
on the outskirts of East Jebel Marra.  However, there are still 
reports of sporadic gunfire and small bands of SLM/A-Minawi fighters 
in the vicinity of the three villages as well as on the outskirts of 
Korma.  This fighting is the most likely cause of the increased IDP 
flow to the Zam Zam IDP camp, reportedly ranging from 1000 to 3000 
new IDPs.  There were no reports of SAF or janjaweed elements 
involved in the fighting. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Meanwhile, skirmishing allegedly instigated by SLM/A-Minawi 
forces in UM Sidir and Baashim/Tina against G-19 forces north of 
Korma broke out July 9.  The G-19 forces reportedly included 
elements of the National Redemption Front (NRF) attack on Hamrat al 
Sheik in Kordafan on July 3 (reftel C).  On July 10, SLM/A-Minawi 
forces attacked the main body of NRF/G-19 forces on the outskirts of 
Birmaza.  G-19 Commander Adam Ali Shogar reported the attack to 
UNDSS and claimed there was a white helicopter with AMIS stenciled 
on the bottom of the aircraft flying over the battle and landing in 
the rear of the SLM-M forces.  He also stated that there was a white 
Antonov aircraft circling above the fighting.  There was no report 
of close air support or any hostile actions by either aircraft.  The 
fighting continued through the afternoon, but by July 11 
SLM/A-Minawi forces had either reportedly withdrawn or were driven 
out of Birmaza.  The G-19 Commander Shogar claimed 8 of his forces 
KIA, 9 WIA, and 24 civilians killed.  There is no independent 
verification of these figures.  An SLM/A-Minawi commander confirmed 
that an Antonov aircraft was in the vicinity of the fighting. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The UNDSS RSO reported that G-19 Commander Shogar 
originally made no claims of janjaweed involvement in the July 9-10 
attack.  However, following a similar claim made from Europe by 
recently dismissed SLM spokesman Esam Edin El-Haj, Shogar has since 
stated that his force had been attacked by janjaweed forces.  The 
UNDSS RSO felt that this later claim was part of an active campaign 
to discredit Minawi and his forces by elements of the 
non-signatories.  He planned to return to the vicinity of Korma on 
July 12 to complete his investigation of the first incident and 
begin an investigation of the fighting further north.
