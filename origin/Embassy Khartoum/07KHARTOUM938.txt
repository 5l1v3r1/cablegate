SUMMARY 
------- 
 
(U) In contrast to ever-worsening security and declining 
humanitarian access in many areas of Darfur, Mukjar town in West 
Darfur is relatively stable and offers opportunities to lay the 
groundwork for future recovery following some of the worst violence 
and trauma inflicted on the Darfurian people in 2003 and 2004. In 
the first visit by USAID staff in approximately one year, a USAID 
Office of Transition Initiatives program manager visited Mukjar from 
May 19 to 21 to oversee project implementation.  End summary. 
 
---------- 
GHOST TOWN 
---------- 
 
¶1. (U) Mukjar and the surrounding area in southern West Darfur is 
populated predominantly by the Fur ethnic group. The current 
population is approximately 15,000 people, including internally 
displaced persons (IDPs), 300 refugees from Chad, and an estimated 
400 of the original 5,000 residents.  Most of the original 
population fled mass executions by government and militia forces in 
and around Mukjar in 2003 and 2004, and now lives in Kalma IDP camp 
in Nyala.  The current security situation is relatively stable 
compared to other areas of West Darfur due to its role as a key 
commercial center linking West and South Darfur. 
 
¶2. U) Current residents, many of whom are relatives of original 
residents, took refuge in Mukjar after their villages in rural areas 
were attacked. IDPs, refugees, and the remaining host community live 
together in town, as there are no formal camps in Mukjar.  Relief 
agencies providing humanitarian services to all current residents 
include USAID-funded International Medical Corps and Mercy Corps, 
and many have been operating in the area since 2004. 
 
--------------------- 
VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED 
--------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Underneath the relative calm that prevails in Mukjar today 
lies the deep-seated trauma of events that occurred there in 2003 to 
¶2004. As detailed in a 2005 Human Rights Watch report, government 
and Arab militias perpetrated vicious attacks and grievous human 
rights violations against Fur residents in the area in response to 
Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) attacks on police stations and 
government offices. 
 
¶4. (U) In August 2003, the government mobilized armed Arab militias, 
and the two groups jointly began attacking Fur villages in the area 
around Mukjar. By November 2003, more than 80 villages had been 
looted and burned, in some cases multiple times.  Most community 
leaders and young men fled to Mukjar. Following further SLA attacks 
on government sites in February 2004, government and militia forces 
rounded up and executed young men and community leaders, including 
those from attacked villages, in groups of 10 to 50 persons. Reports 
indicate that more than 200 men were executed by the beginning of 
March 2004. IDPs were collected in the town's military compound and 
disarmed, and militias were then allowed to loot and kill civilians. 
There were also reports of extended detention sessions during which 
militia members repeatedly raped women. 
 
¶5. (U) A recent Associated Press article titled "Village of the 
Damned" cited observation of a mass grave in Mukjar containing at 
least 25 bodies, one of three dozen alleged mass grave sites in the 
area. Although these sites have not been independently verified, the 
International Criminal Court (ICC) has documented at least 51 cases 
of alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Mukjar 
area, including mass execution, torture, and rape.  Alleged militia 
commander Ali Kushayb was fired from the central reserve police as 
Mukjar regional chief and reportedly arrested by the government 
after being indicted by the ICC. Kushayb has been replaced by his 
deputy, whom residents say is the remaining area militia leader.

A PRISON WITHOUT WALLS 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Residents refer to Mukjar town as a "prison without walls". 
The town is relatively safe, but no one ventures very far outside

the town limits. Women IDPs interviewed by USAID staff reported that 
they do not feel secure inside or outside of the town. They have no 
confidence in African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) troops, who they 
claim rarely respond to incidents of banditry or other attacks. 
Women IDPs who have been in Mukjar since 2004 reported that neither 
they nor their families have returned to their villages since 
fleeing. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Despite perceptions of insecurity among female IDPs, 
reports of violence against women (VAW) in the area are quite low in 
comparison to other parts of Darfur based on limited available 
reporting. Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
staff indicated only three cases of rape were reported in Mukjar in 
2006, and one case to date in 2007. Mukjar was cited as an area in 
which "protection by presence" has succeeded, according to a 
December 2006 Humanitarian Policy Group study on protection in 
Darfur. UNHCR staff speculated that more incidents may occur and go 
unreported in outlying areas. 
 
¶8. (SBU) UNHCR reported that AMIS has not conducted firewood patrols 
in Mukjar since the locality commissioner refused to allow the last 
attempted patrol in April 2007. Shortly thereafter, a woman reported 
a rape while collecting firewood. UNHCR staff indicated that women 
IDPs meet with two female AMIS civilian police officers twice 
monthly to discuss concerns. In addition, the women IDPs have 
received training on fuel efficient stoves, intended to reduce 
reliance on firewood and limit exposure to possible attacks.

HOPE FOR THE FUTURE 
------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) As one of the areas most heavily impacted by the conflict, 
yet with relative security and ease of access, USAID is implementing 
several small grants in Mukjar to assist the community in recovering 
from trauma. Community members identified access to education as a 
key concern and a means for restoring confidence and hope among 
residents. In late 2006, USAID supported a literacy course aimed at 
men that included awareness-raising sessions on issues of VAW.  The 
program complemented existing literacy courses for women. 
 
¶10. (U) USAID is now supporting a follow-on literacy course to 
benefit additional community members. In addition, USAID is 
providing funding for the completion of a co-educational secondary 
school begun by the original residents before the conflict. In 
initial assessments, residents noted that this activity would be a 
symbolic gesture and help bring healing to the community. All 
activities are implemented by community-based organizations. USAID 
is also seeking to identify additional opportunities to work with 
IDP youth, which may include skills training and recreational 
opportunities. These activities provide a positive entry point to 
gain the trust of the community, paving the way for subsequent 
support to build skills in conflict resolution and civic 
participation.
