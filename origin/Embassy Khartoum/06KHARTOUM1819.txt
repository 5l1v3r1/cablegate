¶4. (SBU) Comment:  Amb. Hassan Bashir underscored the significance 
of this request for agrement, which represents a unilateral 
diplomatic upgrade from the current level of Charge.  He expressed 
hopes that the measure would be reciprocated, as the GNU seeks 
normalized relations with the U.S.  He recalled that the U.S. was 
present at the signing of both the CPA and the DPA, and served as a 
"guardian of peace."  The two recent visits to Washington of the 
First Vice President also served as an indication of the importance 
of the bilateral relationship.

part to clarify his citizenship.  End comment.
