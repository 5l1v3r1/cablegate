¶1. (SBU) Summary: The UN has agreed to allow Canadian-financed 
helicopter contractor Skylink to provide air support to UNAMID until 
March 31, 2008.  However, in a change from AMIS operations, the UN 
prohibits UN personnel to use Skylink aircraft resulting in large 
numbers of UN personnel waiting for transportation. End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Canadian political officer Tara Lawrence told poloff on 
January 3 that the UN approved on January 2 the use of 
Canadian-financed contractor Skylink until March 31, 2008.  The 
Canadians, who provided funding for AMIS air transport through the 
contractor Skylink, offered in fall 2007 to continue funding air 
transport for UNAMID (reftel). Lawrence said that when Troop 
Contributing Countries (TCC) do finally provide helicopters, the UN 
and Canada have agreed to proportionally reduce the use of 
Canadian-financed helicopters. For the time being, UNAMID has use of 
Skylink's 25 MI-8 helicopters and two fixed wing aircraft.  The UN 
has eight helicopters but not all are available for flight 
operations given lack of Sudanese certification for the aircraft. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to an internal Skylink communication provided to 
poloff, there is considerable command and control confusion as 
UNAMID begins operations.  Skylink said that under UN command there 
are delays in obtaining essential documents causing delays and 
inefficiencies.  In addition, the UN is unable to obtain required 
flight clearances into JEM-controlled areas resulting in the failure 
to resupply UNAMID camps at Tine, Genaina, Umm Barro, Sari Fumra and 
Kulbus. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Skylink also revealed that despite the decision to use the 
Canadian-funded service, whereby AMIS personnel were transported by 
Skylink, with the transition, UN personnel are prohibited from 
flying on Skylink aircraft.  As a result, "several hundred" UN 
troops and personnel are still waiting to be transported to various 
locations.  Skylink said the Chief of Integrated Support Services 
(CISS) is attempting to resolve the issue but that there is 
"considerable acrimony at UNAMID HQ given the rather abrupt stop to 
current operations." 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The UN is apparently making policy decisions 
without first examining the likely effect on its ability to deploy 
personnel and maintain its logistical supply chain.  While the lack 
of key personnel, perhaps made worse by a holiday exodus, may not 
have helped the situation, in fairness, DPKO expected to have 
command of its own TCC helicopters by now.  We expect delays of this 
kind as UNAMID struggles in an extremely complex environment.
