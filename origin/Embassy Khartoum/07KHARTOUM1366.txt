¶1.  Summary.  In a recent meeting with USAID, the U.N. Mission in 
Sudan (UNMIS) reported that 1.24 million former internally displaced 
persons (IDPs) have returned to the Three Areas and Southern Sudan 
since the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 
January 2005.  Based on IDP surveys, UNMIS estimates that 1.2 
million of the 3.4 million IDPs who are still displaced will not 
return home and prefer to stay in Khartoum or other areas with 
economic opportunities, leaving approximately 2.2 million IDPs and 
refugees in need of returns-related assistance in the coming years. 
Returnees, humanitarian agencies, and Government of Southern Sudan 
(GOSS) officials report that the lack of schools throughout Southern 
Sudan is a primary challenge facing returnees and a major deterrent 
to future returns.  Returnees and government officials also cited 
inadequate health care facilities as a key concern.  Despite 
strained resources, GOSS officials continue to welcome all 
returnees, cognizant that the census is approaching.  End summary. 
 
----------------- 
RETURNS BY REGION 
----------------- 
 
¶2.  USAID partner the International Organization for Migration (IOM) 
reports that Northern Bahr el Ghazal State has received the greatest 
number of returnees in 2007, followed by Southern Kordofan State. 
IOM has tracked more than 42,000 people returning to Northern Bahr 
el Ghazal in 2007, including spontaneous returnees who traveled 
without the assistance of the international community.  Southern 
Kordofan has received more than 20,000 returnees and Warrab State 
has received more than 17,000 returnees. 
 
¶3.  When large-scale returns resume in November following the rainy 
season, Jonglei State and southeastern Central Equatoria State are 
poised to receive large numbers of returnees.  Tens of thousands of 
Dinka from Bor, Jonglei State, have been living for years in the 
Nimule, Lobone, and Kajo Keji areas of southeastern Central 
Equatoria.  The continued presence of the Dinka is a source of 
tension with the Acholi, the original residents of the area.  Many 
Acholi remain in refugee camps in Uganda and are awaiting the 
departure of the Dinka.  IOM is in the process of collecting data 
regarding numbers of IDPs who intend to return, organized by 
village.  A complicating factor is the large number of Dinka cattle. 
 As has been done in previous Dinka returns, IOM is suggesting that 
some Dinka walk the cattle from Central Equatoria to Jonglei with a 
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) escort.  An additional 
complicating factor is that some Dinka may refuse to leave, a 
potential source of conflict in the already volatile area. 
 
--------------------------------- 
SCHOOLS, HEALTH FACILITIES NEEDED 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  In August, USAID staff visited Upper Nile, Jonglei, and Central 
Equatoria states.  While these states have not been the top 
destinations for returnees to date, their issues are representative 
of all areas of the south.  In all three states, local officials and 
returnees sent a clear message that the lack of educational 
facilities in Southern Sudan is a deterrent to returns.  The case of 
Jonglei State is illustrative of the challenges facing Southern 
Sudan.  Only three secondary schools serve the state's population of 
800,000, which is expected to top 1 million by the end of 2007. 
While dozens of primary schools exist, many are in poor condition, 
with classes held under trees.  By contrast, in Khartoum and in 
refugee camps in neighboring countries, displaced persons have 
access to primary and secondary schools.  A representative of the 
Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) conceded 
that access to education in places of displacement may act as a 
deterrent to returns and that the organization has debated whether 
to reduce camp educational services. 
 
¶5.  Although the number of health facilities is disputed -- the U.N. 
World Health Organization estimates between 700 and 800, while GOSS 
officials estimate more than 1,000 -- it is clear that the current 
health infrastructure is insufficient.  In Jonglei State, only two 
hospitals are functioning.  Even in areas where smaller health 
centers or units exist, drug availability remains problematic.  The 
GOSS Ministry of Health (MOH) has not shipped drugs to the states 
since May 2006.  U.N. officials report that GOSS warehouses in Juba 
are overflowing with drugs, but the GOSS lacks funding for

transport.  In response to this void, entrepreneurs are opening 
"pharmacies" in town markets and importing drugs themselves, but 
often these businessmen are not medically trained professionals. 
Due to concerns over the spread of illness during the rainy season, 
the U.N. plans to help the GOSS transport drugs to some areas, but a 
longer-term procurement and delivery system is needed. 
 
¶6.  Government officials indicated that the lack of other basic 
services should not be a deterrent for returns, stating that 
communities would welcome back their kin with open arms and be 
willing to share scarce food and supplies.  All returnees 
interviewed reported that they were glad to have returned home 
despite the difficulties.  "Home is home, even if it's bad," said 
one returnee.

USAID SUPPORT FOR IDP RETURNS 
----------------------------- 
 
¶7.  In FY 2007, the USAID Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance 
(USAID/OFDA) is providing USD 3.5 million to IOM for IDP returns, 
reintegration projects, and capacity building to improve the ability 
of the Southern Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (SSRRC) 
to monitor spontaneous returns and plans to provide an additional 
USD 1 million of support.  USAID is particularly focused on the 
movement of IDPs through two corridors.  As reported reftel, to move 
returnees from Khartoum to Equatoria, USAID/OFDA is encouraging the 
use of road transport from Khartoum to Bentiu, then river transport 
from Bentiu to Juba.  USAID is also supporting the movement of as 
many as 7,500 Dinka from the Lobone, Nimule, and Kajo Keji areas. 
Through IOM, USAID has supported the establishment of a GOSS Joint 
Operations Center in Juba to collect returns tracking information 
from the states. 
 
¶8.  USAID/OFDA supports more than 260 health facilities in the south 
and is working to transition these emergency activities to 
longer-term development partners.  USAID is also funding water, 
sanitation, and hygiene services in areas of high return and 
providing seeds and tools to returnees.
