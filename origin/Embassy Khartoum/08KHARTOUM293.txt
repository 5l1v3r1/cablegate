¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Addressing a mass rally in Khartoum organized by 
government-affiliated Islamic organizations, President Bashir 
denounced cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed that were recently 
republished in Danish newspapers.  An embargo on Danish trade and 
travel has been reported in the press, but Denmark's mission in 
Khartoum has not so far been notified of any such actions.  End 
Summary. 
 
President Bashir Addresses Demonstrators

¶2. (U) Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir on February 27 addressed a 
crowd reliably estimated at 15,000 to 20,000 (pro-government 
newspapers claimed turnout was over one million) at a peaceful mass 
rally in Khartoum protesting "the cartoons insulting the Prophet 
Mohammed (PBUH) which were reprinted by Danish newspapers."  The 
demonstration was called by the "Sudan Forum for Defending the 
Prophet Mohammed," an organization closely affiliated with the 
ruling National Congress Party (NCP).  Protesters gathered at 
Khartoum and El Neilan Universities and converged on the 
Presidential Palace, where leaders delivered a protest letter, and 
Bashir and others addressed the crowd. 
 
¶3.  (U) According to press reports, Bashir told the crowd "We urge 
all Muslims around the world to boycott Danish commodities, goods, 
companies, institutions, organizations and personalities."  He added 
that "not a single Danish foot will from now on desecrate the land 
of Sudan."  The crowd responded with shouts of "Down, down Denmark!" 
 Expanding beyond the immediate issue of the Danish cartoons, Bashir 
added "the blood of Muslims is shed and their honor violated in 
Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan and Bosnia." 
 
Trade Embargo Announced in the Press

¶4.  (SBU) In addition to the February 27 demonstration, Sudan's 
Government of National Unity (GNU) on February 26 announced a 
prohibition on Danish imports into Sudan.  The Director General of 
Sudan's Customs Police is reported to have said that his agency is 
very serious about implementing the decree.  However, as of February 
28, the Danish mission in Khartoum had received no official 
notification of an embargo or any restrictions on travel by Danish 
citizens. 
 
Comment 
- - - - 
¶5. (SBU) Wednesday's march and rally were notable for their lack of 
spontaneity.  Given the Forum's ties to the NCP and GNU, a large 
turnout was fully expected.  (One cell phone company sent a canned 
text message to all of its subscribers the night before, announcing 
the "million man march.")  The controversy over the cartoons 
provides Sudan's generally unpopular government with an opportunity 
to portray itself as the defender of a beleaguered Islamic faith, 
under attack by a hostile West, and to divert attention from its own 
behavior in Darfur and elsewhere.  We have seen little indication of 
independent popular outrage.  Denmark's trade with Sudan is minimal, 
but Sudan (especially Darfur) is a significant recipient of Danish 
humanitarian assistance.  Danish NGO's are active, and Danes work in 
various international organizations present in Sudan.  How the GNU's 
announced embargo (if it is actually to be enforced) will affect 
their operations is not yet clear.
