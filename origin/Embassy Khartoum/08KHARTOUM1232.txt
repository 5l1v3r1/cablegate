SUBJECT: WHERE OIL AND DARFUR INTERSECT - FIGHTING REPORTED IN 
EXPLORATION AREA OF NORTH DARFUR 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Following reports of fighting in North Darfur, 
SLA/AW Commander Suleiman Marajan told poloff via satellite phone on 
August 14 that there was significant fighting between his forces and 
the Sudanese Armed Forces on August 10 and 11 near Wadi Atrun, an 
area Marajan claimed oil exploration is now ongoing.  Marajan stated 
that a force of 270 SAF and militia vehicles killed nine of his 
fighters and 80 civilians in the combat.  Minni Minnawi confirmed 
both rapid SAF deployment to North Darfur and GoS oil interests in 
the region, but downplayed reports of fighting between SLA/AW and 
SAF.  This alleged clash  follows July reports announcing the start 
of oil exploration in North Darfur's block 12a.  If true, this 
incident could be one of the first reports of oil fueling the 
conflict within the borders of Darfur.  END SUMMARY 
 
PRESS REPORTS 
- - - - - - - 
¶2.  (SBU)  On August 13, international press (relying on exclusively 
rebel claims) reported that SAF started a "massive operation" to 
destroy rebel positions in North Darfur near the village of Wadi 
Atrun in oil block 12a.  On August 14, "Al-Sudani" reported that the 
SAF spokesman denied these claims, saying "Up to yesterday there 
were no battles and all that is being said are lies."  The same 
article quoted Ahmed Babikir from SLM-Unity saying that the GoS was 
"implementing a wide-ranging military plan in Darfur, attacking 
areas of Wadi Atrun, Al-Malha and Al-Sayyah." 
 
MARAJAN REPEATS REPORTS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶3.  (SBU)  On August 14, SLA/AW commander of the region, Suleiman 
Marajan confirmed to poloff via satellite phone that approximately 
270 GoS vehicles attacked his positions near Wadi Atrun and Rahat. 
(Note:  Marajan has been active in the conflict since its inception. 
 Marajan was one of Minnawi's leading Meidob commanders, but was 
later imprisoned by Minnawi after he failed to attend the 2005 
Haskanita conference where Minnawi was elected the chairman of SLA 
in place of Abdul Wahid Nur.  End Note.)  Marajan said he lost 9 men 
in the fighting, and that GoS forces killed an additional 80 
civilians in the battle.  Marajan stated that the GoS force was a 
combined SAF and militia unit. 
 
ALLEGIANCE TO SLA/AW 
- - - - - - - - - - - 
¶4.  (SBU)  Despite a period of being an independent, Marajan 
repeatedly confirmed that he now belongs to the Sudan Liberation 
Army led by Abdul Wahid Al-Nur (SLA/AW).  He stated that he is in 
regular contact with Nur, and Nur's field commanders based in Jebel 
Marra.  He stated that despite his relative proximity to Minnawi, he 
has not had any communication with his former boss. 
 
"OIL IS THE REASON" 
- - - - - - - - - - 
¶5.  (SBU)  Marajan said the GoS is attempting to clear the area of 
rebels and people to protect its oil interests in the region.  He 
added there are three large camps of Asian oil workers between Wadi 
Atrun and Karab Atom.  According to Marajan, the camps have 
approximately 300 vehicles, heavy equipment, and hundreds of men. 
Marajan was not able to provide the name of the oil company in 
charge of the operation. 
 
"GOS SEEKS MILLITARY SOLUTION" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶6.  (SBU)  Marajan said that this attack is also part of a greater 
military offensive by the GoS in Darfur.  According to Marajan the 
recent visit of the GoS Defense Minister to Darfur was part of the 
government's effort to devise a military strategy and coordinate 
SAF, intelligence, and the government militias in Darfur (GOS 
sources claimed that the visit was to improve security to provide 
better humanitarian access, and freely admit that it also meant 
targeting nests of bandits and carjackers).   "Bashir is now talking 
about peace, but he really is going to attack all of Darfur.  He 
feels like he is tricking the international community," stated 
Marajan. 
 
MINNI CONFIRMS GOVERNMENT ACTIVITY AND OIL INTERESTS.. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶7.  (SBU)  On August 14, Senior Presidential Assistant and chairman 
of the Sudan Liberation Movement, Minni Minnawi, told poloff by 
satellite phone that the GoS continues significant military 
deployment in North Darfur, specifically mentioning the cities of 
Tine, Kornoi, Um Baro, and Wadi Atrun.  (Note:  Since June, Minnawi 
has been in the field in North Darfur.  As of August 11, he was only 
several hundred kilometers from Wadi Atrun with many fighters 
throughout the entire region. End Note.)  Minnawi said that he has 
received reports from Darfuri traders and herders leaving the area 
 
KHARTOUM 00001232  002 OF 002 
 
 
of Wadi Atrun due to a significant GoS build-up in the region. 
Minnawi said that the GoS has long been interested in oil 
exploration in Darfur, something he urged the GoS to forgo until 
Darfur is peaceful and stable. 
 
. . . BUT DOWNPLAYS THE LEVEL OF FIGHTING 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶8.  (SBU)  Despite his acknowledgement of the military buildup and 
displacement of people from Wadi Atrun, Minnawi downplayed reports 
of fighting.  Minnawi stated that SAF recently moved into Wadi Atrun 
and took the city without "any fighting."  According to Minnawi, 
Marajan does not have any fighters, but "just a group of guys who 
steal vehicles and  money from the trucks."  (COMMENT:  Minnawi's 
dismissive approach to Marajan is not surprising given their 
troubled history.  END COMMENT.)  In addition to moving into 
potential oil areas, Minnawi said that the most likely reason for 
the SAF deployment was an impending attack on his own position and 
troops.  "After Williamson's visit, my sources are telling me that 
the GoS wants to discover my coordinates and surround me," said 
Minnawi.  Minnawi also stated that "The GoS is scared of my 
relationship with the U.S., and they want to target me." 
 
OIL EXPLORATION ONGOING IN NORTH DARFUR 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶9.  (SBU)  On July 9, the Sudan Tribune reported that seismic work 
would begin shortly in Block 12a in North Darfur, calling this "the 
first exploration deep into Darfur since conflict erupted in 2003." 
The article quotes a representative of one company involved in the 
exploration, who reports that SAF forces would soon be deployed to 
the region to ensure a secure environment for the oil exploration. 
The article also specifically mentions the border station of Karab 
Atom, one area of conflict specifically mentioned by Marajan above. 
 
 
¶10.  (SBU)  Norwegian Petroleum Envoy Anders Hannevik told poloff on 
August 14 that Block 12a is a "black hole that we have very little 
information about."  Although he said he knew little about ongoing 
exploratory efforts, he did note that conducting seismic studies 
would require a very large presence similar to the one Marajan 
described.  "You cannot do seismic in the dark," said Hannevik, 
adding that Marajan's claim of 300 vehicles "would be about right" 
for the manpower needed for this important step in exploration. 
Hannevik cautioned, however, that he cannot imagine the GoS 
conducting exploration in Darfur during this very tense period. 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - - 
¶10.  (SBU)  Like many reports coming from the most remote and 
isolated regions in Darfur, it is difficult to get independent and 
trustworthy information regarding this reported fighting (the areas 
in question are closer to Libya than to North Darfur's state capital 
at El Fasher).  Some form of fighting likely took place, but we 
suspect that Marajan's report is exaggerated.  (Note:  Sudan 
veteran, OCHA head Mike McDonough describes Suleiman Marajan as "a 
notable brigand" and many other observers have also questioned 
Marajan's character and notable silence in the last year.  End 
Note.)  What is more significant about this event is that it could 
be one of the first reports of oil fueling the conflict in Darfur. 
While there have been JEM attacks on oil facilities in neighboring 
Kordofan, this appears to be a first within the borders of Darfur. 
Darfuris, from rebel leaders such as Khalil Ibrahim to average 
citizens on the street, often claim that Darfur has a wealth of 
natural resources controlled by the government.  Until now, these 
leaders have had little proof of these claims.  With the possibility 
of ongoing exploration in North Darfur, all of this could change, 
further irritating an already explosive region. END COMMENT.
