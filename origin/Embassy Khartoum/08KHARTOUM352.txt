¶1. (U) Summary:  Newly-appointed AEC Chair Ambassador (Sir) Derek 
Plumbly chaired his first plenary meeting March 4.  The most 
significant agenda item was a discussion of drafting procedures for 
the AEC's Mid Term Evaluation (MTE) as mandated by the Comprehensive 
Peace Accord.  The meeting also addressed the conflict stemming from 
the recent designation by the SPLM of an Abyei Administrator and the 
deteriorating security situation in that troubled region.  The AEC 
decided to send a Verification Team to visit Abyei.  End Summary 
 
New Chairman's debut 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) In his introductory remarks, Plumbly stressed his 
determination to carry out his duties in an independent and 
even-handed manner.  He noted that the AEC secretariat staff has 
been "denuded," and needs to be replaced.  Plumbly also stated his 
desire to hold occasional meetings in Juba. 
 
MTE:  Hew to the deadlines 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) The AEC's priority is timely preparation of the MTE. 
Plumbly confirmed that the two parties had approved the draft "Terms 
of Reference" containing a time-line for completion of the MTE that 
culminates in presentation of a report to the President by July 9. 
An MTE Steering Committee, made up of representatives of each 
Working Group Coordinator and the two sides, is to meet March 16 to 
work out a draft skeleton outline for the MTE.  Plumbly said a 
"primary drafter" should be responsible for drafting the MTE. 
(Earlier, Plumbly told Coordinators he is "shaking the tree" in 
London to find a drafter, but would welcome suggestions from other 
parties.) 
 
¶4. (U) Among the other items raised by Plumbly: 
 
-- CONSORTIUM MEETING:  The next donor's Consortium meeting is 
scheduled for April 22-23 in Paris, and Plumbly said he will attend. 
 There he will present a status report on the AEC and CPA, after 
consulting with the members.  April's Sudan Consortium would provide 
an opportunity to encourage the international community to re-commit 
to the CPA process. 
 
 
-- BUDGET:  Plumbly said he will present a draft AEC budget at the 
next AEC plenary, after he hears from the four Working Groups (WGs). 
 In particular, he needs to know whether WGs will require field 
visits to complete the MTE.  He thanked the U.S. and Norway for 
their recent commitments of funds that will allow the AEC to 
continue operating. 
 
-- FACTUAL REPORT:  Plumbly urged members to constantly update the 
two-year Factual Report as a running document. 
 
ABYEI: Will the real administrator please stand up 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5.  (U) The Dutch DCM asked the two sides to provide a briefing on 
reports of recent violence in Abyei, and confusion over the naming 
of an administrator for the area.  Referring to Edward Lino, the 
"administrator" named by the SPLM, the NCP stated that "it's illegal 
to have an administrator who is not appointed by the Presidency." 
The NCP representative acknowledged that the Abyei administrator 
recently named by Misseriya tribal leaders is also illegal.  He 
reiterated that the SPLM is to nominate an administrator, but the 
nomination must be approved by the Presidency.  The Presidency is 
awaiting a report from the SPLM before naming the administrator. 
Recent violence was connected to the redeployment of the Sudanese 
Armed Forces (SAF), he claimed, but added that the redeployment 
would be completed by July.  SPLM Minister Kosti Manibe defended the 
SPLM's action in naming an administrator, saying it had acted to 
address a chronic lack of government attention.  For the last two 
and a half years, he said, the people of Abyei have had to make do 
without essential government services.  "Abyei is both a part of the 
North and of the South," he said. 
 
Verification Team to Visit Abyei 
------------------------------ 
 
¶6.  (U) The Norwegian Ambassador noted that under the AEC's rules of 
procedure, the AEC is empowered to send a "verification team" to 
Abyei.  The Netherlands, whose embassy heads up the Three Areas 
Working Group, voiced support for sending a verification team.  The 
SPLM also expressed support.  Plumley concluded saying that given 
the urgent security situation in Abyei, he hoped the Three Areas 
Working Group would send a verification team.  (NOTE:  The 
Verification Team visit is scheduled for March 12-14, organized by 
the (UK) Security Working Group.  DLO and POL/ECON will represent 
the U.S. Embassy.  END NOTE.) 
 
 
KHARTOUM 00000352  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The NCP urged "a robust schedule of meetings" to 
produce an MTE by the July deadline - implicitly drawing attention 
to the SPLM's lack of depth in personnel it can detail to AEC 
meetings.  Other WG members confirm that, in recent weeks, Minister 
Kosti Manibe has been virtually the only SPLM representative at AEC 
meetings, and he is obviously spread very thin.  The February 17 
WSWG meeting had to be aborted after the SPLM sent a representative 
not empowered to make decisions.  The Norwegian Ambassador stated 
that Norway is prepared to fund an SPLM staff member who would be 
focused full time on AEC issues and activities.  Given the scarcity 
of personnel at some embassies and in the SPLM able to devote 
themselves fulltime to AEC activities, completion of the Mid Term 
Evaluation by the July 9 deadline will be a challenge.
