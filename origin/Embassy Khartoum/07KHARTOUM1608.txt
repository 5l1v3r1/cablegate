SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary. In an October 4 report, the Chief of Plans for 
UNAMID Transition, Colonel Johnstone, in El Fasher, North Darfur, 
described current UNAMID deployment status.  He termed GOS 
cooperation to date as "reasonable," noted the complexity of the 
transition, provided a rundown of troop contributions to date, and 
cited the lack of helicopters as negatively affecting their 
capabilities. End Summary. 
 
GOS COOPERATION: REASONABLE 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) He described GoS efforts to facilitate deployment of the 
Heavy Support Package (HSP) as 'overall reasonable.'  He said there 
were a few problems with local authorities, but felt these problems 
stemmed from issues over payment and proper paperwork, not from any 
GoS policy of obstruction.  Other problems, he said, were due to the 
sheer complexity and magnitude of the deployment operation. 
 
AN EXTREMELY LARGE, COMPLEX UNDERTAKING 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Observers and many UNAMID officers believe that the 
AMIS-UNAMID transition is the most complex operation in UN history. 
No matter how cooperative and supportive the GoS chooses to be, the 
enlargement of a 7,000 person AMIS force into a hybrid force of over 
23,000 soldiers plus thousands of civpols and civilians, in a large, 
remote area with little water and natural resources faces a number 
of logistical and organizational challenges.  Darfur is already 
straining to support the indigenous population, and is still 
undergoing desertification. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Water will be a limiting factor, and UNAMID is in the 
process of obtaining permission to use the required tracts of land. 
While African nations have pledged significant numbers of infantry 
units to maintain UNAMID's 'African character,' the UN is focused on 
recruiting larger units (800 instead of 680 man battalions), and, 
perhaps more importantly, ensuring that they are adequately 
equipped.  The HSP still has insufficient pledges for medium 
transport helicopters, tactical helicopters, and heavy ground 
transportation assets.  Finally, the UN has not yet signed contracts 
for the support and maintenance at its camps. 
 
ISSUES WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) At the same time, there are small but important issues 
related to deployment of UNAMID troops that need to be resolved. 
Local officials at Port Sudan's Port Authority have raised concerns 
with the Ministry of Interior and other ministries over who will pay 
for the port service fees associated with use of the port.  Local 
officials in El Fasher have demanded to know the UN's authority to 
operate communications equipment in Sudan.  Johnstone dismissed this 
issue as already being covered in their Status of Forces Agreement 
(SOFA).  He further stated that this issue requires time and effort 
to reach a mutually satisfactory understanding with local officials.

troops. End Note. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The report identified several shortfalls in critical areas: 
three Medium Utility Wings, two Medium Heavy Transportation 
Companies, and a Light Tactical Helicopter Wing.  UNAMID said the 
shortfalls will have a negative impact on operational and logistical 
capabilities.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) The UN faces enormous challenges in Darfur, but, so far, 
the obstacles to deployment of the AU-UN Hybrid force are more 
logistical and organizational than political.  According to UN 
commanders, GoS has been reasonable in facilitating this operation.
