¶1. (SBU) Summary: Despite ongoing high profile pronouncements 
regarding the alleged arrest of notorious janjaweed militia leader 
Ali Kushayb, little actual proof has emerged that Kushayb is in GOS 
custody.  Meeting with polchief, (SPLM) State Minister of Justice 
Wek Kuol said he had heard Kushayb was in custody, but knew of no 
details of the arrest. Poloffs in El Fasher and Khartoum queried 
sources throughout Darfur regarding the fate of the militia leader, 
but none was able to confirm Kushayb's arrest and detention. 
Darfuris in the know claimed the announcement was a ploy to delay 
the ICC, and that Kushayb remains at large. End Summary.

GNU MINISTER ON ARREST: "THIS IS WHAT I HAVE HEARD"

¶2. (SBU) On October 16, poloffs met with the Government of National 
Unity's State Minister of Justice Wek Mamer Koul to discuss the 
arrest of Ali Kushayb.  Wek, an appointee of the SPLM to the GNU, 
said without much confidence that he had heard Kushayb had been 
arrested, but didn't have any details, offering "This is what I know 
so far, that he is in Geneina."  Wek could not confirm where Kushayb 
was being held, the date of Kushayb's trial, or whether the GOS's 
own Chief Prosecutor for war crimes in Darfur had completed his 
report on Kushayb's crimes. (Note: Often the NCP does not share 
information with the SPLM, even at the Ministerial level, so this 
may not be an indication that Kushayb's detention is a fabrication. 
However, it is still remarkable that the number two at the Ministry 
of Justice had not heard any details. End note.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) When asked under which law Kushayb would be tried, Wek did 
not acknowledge concerns that Sudanese law currently has no statute 
equivalent to the ICC's charge of commission of war crimes and 
crimes against humanity.  "The problem is not the law, it is the 
interpretation of the law," Wek said, adding, "the prosecutor must 
meet the standard for the criminal court" when trying Kushayb. 
According to Wek, Sudanese law dictates that the location of the 
crime determines the location of the trial, and while the trial 
would most likely be held in El Geneina, the MOJ reserves the right 
to change the venue.  Wek was tight-lipped when asked if the 
prosecutor was investigating other Darfuris or GOS officials for 
similar crimes.

LAWYERS ASK "HABEAS CORPUS?"

¶4. (SBU) In conversations with poloff on October 15, lawyers from 
the independent Darfur Bar Association (DBA) scoffed at the 
assertion that Kushayb was in custody, and disputed the announcement 
that the Sudanese MOJ was prepared to try Kushayb within the next 
week.  Speaking by telephone from El Geneina, West Darfur, Imam Abu 
Talib laughed out loud at the suggestion that authorities were 
holding Kushayb there. "He is not here. This morning I asked at the 
court and at the police. They have no news about him," Abu Talib 
said.  The DBA's chief legal advocate in West Darfur, Abu Talib 
assured poloff that had authorities arrested the militia leader, the 
fact would be well-known in West Darfur. Abdelrahman Gasim, DBA 
secretary, said the association would send legal observers if there 
is  a trial, but remained skeptical that the GOS could find a law in 
its legal code under which to try Kushayb. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Regarding the possibility for Kushayb to receive a fair and 
thorough trial, West Darfur civil society advocate Tajj Alsir said 
that even if Kushayb were tried, witnesses would not come forward to 
testify against him.  "Police are still retaliating against 
witnesses for reporting janjaweed attacks.  It's a joke - there is 
no chance for a fair trial," he said.  Having worked in El Geneina 
from 2004 to 2008 for the Sudanese NGO Community Development 
Association, Alsir observed that West Darfur is in total chaos.  He 
said that with the janjaweed exerting Mafia-like control over the 
city proper, it is inconceivable that the GOS has enough authority 
to try the militia leader in an area which served as his home-base 
from 2003 to 2004. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: While the GOS's August appointment of the chief 
prosecutor for war crimes in Darfur was a small step forward, this 
week's announcement of the "arrest" of a militia leader on the ICC's 
hit-list has proven impossible to confirm concretely, even for the 
government's own minister.  This suggests that the GOS is not as 
serious (or coordinated) on the war crimes issue as they would like 
to appear. At best, they are wildly exaggerating the results of a 
timid and tentative process, if one actually exists.  Sudanese 
trials that meet international standards are hard to find, and for 
the Sudanese to hold a trial of Kushayb rigorous enough to meet the 
 
KHARTOUM 00001538  002 OF 002 
 
 
ICC's requirements for complementarity is likely impossible. 
Although some have suggested that the regime may be willing to pay 
off Kushayb and his family in exchange for Kushayb being the "fall 
guy" for the regime's crimes in Darfur, we would be surprised if 
Kushayb actually shows up at court in El Geneina anytime soon, much 
less subjected to the full weight of an adversarial legal 
proceeding.
