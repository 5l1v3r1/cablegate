REF: KHARTOUM 650 
 
¶1. (SBU) Egyptian Pol/Mil Officer Tamer Azzam told poloff on April 
29 that Egypt plans to nominate an Egyptian BG to replace BG Patrick 
Davidson-Houston as UNAMID Chief of Staff.  He said that Egypt hopes 
to have their nominee in place as early as May 18, pending approval 
by the UN. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Separately, UNAMID Chief of Staff Davidson-Houston told 
Fieldoff that the assumption of his own imminent departure is 
premature.  He said that the UN in New York plans to write a letter 
to the Government of Sudan (GOS) stating that it is actively 
recruiting a replacement for the COS but in the meantime it would be 
appropriate to keep the COS in place until the end of May, the 
half-way mark for his one year contract which ends in November.  The 
COS said the GOS could outright reject the UN proposal, ignore it, 
or quietly go along with it. 
 
¶3. (SBU) UNAMID leadership in El-Fasher told Fieldoff that they have 
no plans to engage with the GoS to counter Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon's private agreement with the President Bashir at the Dakar 
summit. In reftel, post noted that the SYG, without consultation 
with DPKO or UNAMID, agreed with President Bashir to remove the COS 
by the end of April and accept an additional battalion from Egypt 
(making it the third largest TCC in the mission) and from Ethiopia. 
The current COS said UNAMID has been recruiting a replacement for 
him. He said he was unaware of the Egyptian proposal but unsurprised 
as the Egyptians have been lobbying for both the FC and DFC 
positions. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Egyptian Pol/Miloff Azzam said he expected that the 
130-troop Egyptian signals company would have its equipment in place 
by May 19 and that the 120-troop Egyptian transport company would 
have its equipment in place by May 12. He said that given the 
complete lack of preparations for the Egyptians in the Northern 
Sector, he doubted whether the infantry battalion would 
realistically be able to deploy before 2009, in keeping with FC 
Agwai's March agreement with the Egyptian MOD to deploy them at Um 
Kadada. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: The potential appointment of an Egyptian COS 
requires careful consideration. First, many IDPs and Darfuris 
consider the Egyptians as surrogates for the GOS and hence 
untrustworthy.  Appointing an Egyptian COS could severely damage 
UNAMID's credibility in the eyes of most Darfuris if the candidate 
is not an exceptional individual willing to correct this impression. 
In addition, the current UNAMID leadership considers that the 
quality of leadership and management provided by an Egyptian COS may 
not be adequate. 
 
¶6. (SBU) RECOMMENDATION: Given the likely negative reception of the 
Egyptian troops, post suggests that the appointment of an Egyptian 
COS should be avoided if possible.  We recommend that USUN consider 
discrete discussions with the SYG on his apparent unilateral 
decisions on peacekeeping troops.  The FC appears unable to stand up 
to the SYG to pre-empt an Egyptian appointment that would hurt the 
mission (rumor has it the FC is trying to secure his own appointment 
as Military Advisor at UN HQ and is accordingly towing a 
conservative line vis-`-vis the SYG and the GoS).  Therefore, Post 
suggests that the Friends of UNAMID could intervene with the SYG to 
make sure he is properly consulting both UN HQ and UNAMID before 
making decisions that could undermine the Darfur mission - and set a 
bad precedent on TCC decisions for future peacekeeping missions.
