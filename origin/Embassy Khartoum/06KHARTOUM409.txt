SUBJECT:  New Consumer Price Survey in Juba 
 
¶1.  The following is a listing of prices in the consumer 
markets of Juba for the week beginning February 6.  Items 
were selected based on an informal survey of the most 
commonly sold items.  A local resident in Juba employed 
by the USG collected all data. 
 
¶2.  While a more formal consumer price index would be 
weighted to reflect the actual buying habits of consumers 
and wage earning households, this is not possible in 
Juba.  Residents in Juba are not only living in different 
economic circumstances, but in different economies. 
Some, notably those employed by INGOs, live on the 
monetary economy.  Those that work for local business may 
live on the monetary economy or a mix of money and 
barter.  There are also residents who can only barter, as 
well as those that are dependant on subsistence farming 
and hunting/gathering/fishing without any participation 
in the market economy.  Many IDPs and recent returnees 
fall into the latter two categories. 
 
¶3.  Due to the ad hoc nature of data collection, these 
prices are only intended to be used as a general guide to 
capture market conditions.  CG Juba will collect this 
information on a monthly basis and develop the data into 
an informal consumer price index.  While informal, 
changes of prices may be an early indicator in shifts in 
the economy, the effect of demined road openings, 
transportation construction and maintenance, or changes 
in the security situation along trade routes. 
 
¶4.  The following prices are arranged by category and 
generally follow U.S. Department of Labor guidelines.  It 
should be noted that items considered staples in more 
developed economies, such as meat, are rarely bought 
luxury items.  Almost all items are from Uganda.  All 
prices are in Sudanese Dinar (SD).  The current exchange 
rate is 230 SD = 1 USD.
