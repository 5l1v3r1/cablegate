¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Approximately one thousand members of the 
Misseryia, an Arabic-speaking nomadic tribe located primarily in 
South Kordofan State, met October 5 to reject the July 22 decision 
of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), which defined the 
boundaries of Abyei.  Conference attendees agreed to organize a 
Misseryia armed force, and threatened the use of violence if 
necessary.  Proven fighters, the Misseryia will be a major spoiler 
to the peace process unless a compromise is found to prevent them 
from taking up arms.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
MISSERIYA REJECT PCA DECISION, THREATEN VIOLENCE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In an October 6 telephone conversation with Poloff, Sadig 
Babo Nimir, younger brother of the paramount leader of the 
Misseryia, confirmed press reports that approximately 1,000 members 
of the Misseriya tribe, a nomadic, Arabic-speaking ethnic group 
located primarily in South Kordofan state, met October 4-5 to reject 
the July 22 decision of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) 
which defined the boundaries of the special administrative district 
of Abyei.  Nimir did not attend the conference, but said resolutions 
rejecting the PCA decision and the process of demarcation had been 
passed by the group.  He also said that the group had decided to 
appeal the PCA decision to The Hague and to the Supreme Court of 
Sudan, and demanded that the Government of National Unity demarcate 
all other boundaries in the country before demarcating the Abyei 
boundary.  He confirmed press reports that a threat to create an 
armed force had issued from the conference, but downplayed its 
significance; the Misseryia are already well-armed, he said, and 
would need only to come together to fight if the need arose.  Nimer 
opined that the PCA decision was a deal between the Sudan People's 
Liberation Movement (SPLM), and the National Congress Party (NCP), 
did not include the Misseryia, and does not bind the Misseryia, who 
will not abide by it. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Nimir told Poloff that he thinks the decision of the 
attendees reflects the views of all but a few Misseryia.  However, 
in an October 7 conversation with Poloff, David Raikow, Political 
Officer for the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), said that 
he believed conference attendees were primarily Misseryia 
hard-liners, and that there are numerous moderate Misseryia whose 
views were not represented.  Press reports indicated that South 
Kordofan Legislative Assembly members representing Abyei, Muglad, 
El-Salam, Lagawa, Kailk, and Babanousa, all areas with a significant 
Misseryia presence, attended the conference. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
ROOT CAUSE OF PROBLEM: DESERTIFICATION 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In a September 28 meeting with PolChief, Nimir placed 
direct responsibility for rising tensions in the area on the PCA 
decision, but said that the root of the problem is the 
desertification of traditional Misseryia grazing land and dwindling 
access to water.  Nimir said the government has not honored promises 
to use oil money to drill wells for water or to provide other 
services in Misseryia areas. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Nimir said that the Misseryia and the Ngok Dinka shared 
centuries of cooperation and could find a way to live together. 
However, he said that, while war is not a solution, implementation 
of the PCA decision will lead to war, calling the decision "a 
poisoned knife in the back of the CPA." 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Nimir said that the Misseriya have good relations with the 
SPLM, but are beginning to have a problem with the NCP.  "The NCP 
doesn't accept international justice when it comes to Bashir, but 
are willing to accept the PCA decision," he said, adding that the 
NCP is trying to rupture the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). 
Nimir said, however, that if the South secedes, the Misseryia will 
stay with the North.  Nimir said the Ngok Dinka would also prefer to 
stay with the North, and that the best approach is a federal 
solution for Abyei, allowing Abyei residents dual citizenship.

SECURITY DELAYS ABYEI BOUNDARY DEMARCATION 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶7.  (SBU) On October 5, Poloff spoke by phone with Kuwal Beyong 
(SPLM), Deputy Chair of the Abyei Boundary Demarcation Committee, 
the committee tasked with demarcating the Abyei boundary as 
described by the July 22 PCA decision (Ref B).  Beyong confirmed 
news reports that the Abyei Joint Integrated Unit (JIU), tasked with 
 
KHARTOUM 00001135  002 OF 002 
 
 
providing security for the demarcation team, had been ordered back 
to its base on September 28.  Beyong stated that he did not know why 
the JIU had been withdrawn, and said the demarcation team had 
encountered some local Misseryia, but that no friction had resulted. 
(Note: October 6 press reports quoted an unnamed Sudanese Armed 
Forces (SAF) commander in Nyama who said the JIU needed to provide 
advance written documentation of their visit to the border area, as 
this was not part of their area of responsibility.  Post has been 
unable to confirm this report.  End Note.)  As of October 5, Beyond 
said, o physical demarcation of the Abyei boundary had occurred, but 
the Committee was scheduled to meet on October 6 to create a 
timetable for continuing work. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Comment:  The nomadic Misseryia, arguably Khartoum's most 
effective fighters in the North-South civil war, are reportedly 
restless and discontented with Khartoum's treatment since the war's 
end.  Although the PCA decision emphasizes that it is without 
prejudice to the Misseryia's traditional grazing rights in Abyei, 
the Misseryia are aware that in 2011, the Abyei boundaries set 
pursuant to the arbitration award could become an international 
border.  Coupled with their distrust of the government, that 
prospect has turned the boundary demarcation process into an 
existential threat to their entire way of life.    End Comment.
