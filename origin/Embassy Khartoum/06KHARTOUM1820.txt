Notice of the Second Meeting of the Joint Commission 
 
I am directed by the Chairperson of the Joint Commission to inform 
you that following consultations on the contentious issue of the 
participation of the non-DPA signatures in the meetings of the 
Ceasefire Commission (CFC) and the Joint Commission (JC), it is now 
decided that in the first instance, only the signatories to the DPA 
and the Declaration of Commitment (DoC), as well as the 
international partners should participate in the meetings of the two 
Commissions.  This decision is informed by the need to break the 
current impasse whereby both the Government of Sudan and the SLM/A 
(Minni) refuse to sit together in these Commissions with those who 
are not signatories to the DPA or the DoC.  The hope is that as we 
move forward, the need for greater inclusivity will become apparent 
to the hitherto reluctant signatories to the DPA. 
 
I am, therefore, to invite you to the next meeting of the Joint 
Commission on Thursday, 3 August 2006, at 10:00 A.M. in the African 
Union Commission Headquarters in Addis Ababa. 
 
The proposed agenda is as follows: 
 
1) The security situation in Darfur; 
 
2) The Report of the Chairperson of the Ceasefire Commission 
including progress in the implementation of the security aspects of 
the DPA; 
 
3) Any other business. 
 
Your participation will be highly appreciated.
