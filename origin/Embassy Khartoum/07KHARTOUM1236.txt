SUBJECT: SUDAN - USAID AIRLIFTS PLASTIC SHEETING FOR FLOOD-AFFECTED 
FAMILIES 
 
 
¶1.  On August 8, Charge d'Affaires (CDA) Fernandez and 
Undersecretary for the Government of National Unity's (GNU) Ministry 
of Humanitarian Affairs Charles Manyang welcomed the arrival of a 
USAID Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) 
airlift carrying plastic sheeting for flood-affected families in 
Sudan.  A total of two USAID airlifts on August 8 and 9 will provide 
1,300 rolls of plastic sheeting -- enough for 13,000 families or 
78,000 people.  The sheeting is valued at approximately USD 600,000 
and represents USAID's first step in assisting an estimated 365,000 
flood-affected people in Sudan.  USAID consigned the commodities to 
the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) for distribution in northern and 
eastern Sudan. 
 
¶2.  Sudanese journalists attended a press conference at the airport 
and observed the off-loading of cargo on the tarmac.  The event 
opened with remarks from UNICEF Representative Ted Chaiban.  CDA 
Fernandez then addressed the group in Arabic, emphasizing the 
substantial amount of U.S. assistance to the people of Sudan and the 
USG's commitment to working with the GNU and international community 
to meet humanitarian needs.  On behalf of the GNU, Undersecretary 
Manyang welcomed the donation, noting that the United States has 
been a leader in providing aid to Sudan for decades.  Undersecretary 
Manyang recalled with appreciation the USG's role in the formation 
of Operation Lifeline Sudan during the conflict in the south. 
¶3.  The plastic sheeting will be distributed via the Common 
Humanitarian Pipeline, a quick-response distribution network 
established in 2004 and managed by the U.N. Joint Logistics Center 
with support from UNICEF and the non-governmental organization CARE. 
 This distribution mechanism, largely supported by USAID, has played 
a vital role in ensuring that lifesaving supplies such as plastic 
sheeting, cooking sets, and mosquito nets rapidly reach 
flood-affected areas.  The Common Pipeline has already rushed 
supplies to more than 200,000 people in nine states in northern 
Sudan. 
¶4.  USAID is considering additional assistance to flood-affected 
families.  USAID will continue to report on the situation as it 
unfolds.
