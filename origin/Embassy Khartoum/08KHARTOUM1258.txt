¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On August 18, leaders of SLA/Unity pledged their 
cooperation with the International Criminal Court, even if the ICC 
issues indictments against them or their SLA/Unity brethren. 
SLA/Unity leaders also separately told poloff via satphones that 
they support Luis Moreno Ocampo's request for a warrant against 
President Bashir, especially as, "the regime continues its genocidal 
operations in Darfur."  SLA/Unity leaders also discussed their 
relationship with other movements, their lack of communication with 
UNAMID, and increased GoS military operations in North Darfur.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
"WE WILL SUBMIT TO THE ICC" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶2.  (SBU)  On August 18, the leader of SLA/Unity, Abdalla Yahia, and 
his chief military commander, Abubaker Mohamed Kado, both separately 
told poloff that they respect the legitimacy of the ICC and will 
submit to its demands.  (Note: On July 17, the local and 
international press reported that ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo 
is considering charging Darfur rebel commanders with crimes against 
humanity.  The reports specifically mention Kado as one potential 
rebel indictee along with Khalil Ibrahim and Ali Karbino.  The 
reports specifically mention the rebels alleged involvement attacks 
on UNAMID forces- Haskanita in 2007 and Shangil Tobaya in July 2008. 
 End Note.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) "We are ready to fully cooperate with the ICC and will 
turn over anyone the ICC suspects of war crimes," stated Yahia. 
Yahia said he had heard accusations against his military general, 
but stated that Kado was not involved in the 2007 Haskanita attacks, 
nor in the July 2008 attack on UNAMID peacekeepers.  Kado separately 
repeated Yahia's sentiments, stating that anyone in SLA/Unity, and 
"even I" will submit to the ICC.  Kado said that although his troops 
were near Gusa Jamat on July 8, they were not involved in the attack 
on the UNAMID convoy that led to deaths of at least seven UNAMID 
soldiers. 
 
RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER MOVEMENTS AND UNAMID

¶4.  (SBU)  According to Yahia and Kado, SLM/Unity is in close 
communication with SLA/MM leader Minni Minnawi, but downplayed any 
future military coordination.  Yahia reported that he considers 
Minnawi his friend even though the latter is still a part of the 
government.  Both Yahia and Kado stated that as long as Minnawi is a 
part of the Government of National Unity, there will be limits to 
their friendship and level of coordination.  Yahia also stated there 
is occasional field coordination with JEM "without any 
organizational or ideological ties."  Kado reported limited 
coordination with JEM.  Both Yahia and Kado said they have had very 
limited contact with UNAMID in recent months, and no communication 
with the new chief mediator, Djibril Bassole. 
 
GoS MILITARY OPERATIONS AND BASHIR'S INTIATIVE

¶5.  (SBU) According to Yahia, the GoS has continued and expanded its 
military operations in North Darfur near Wadi Atrun (reftel).  Yahia 
stated that he met with SLA/AW Commander Suliman Marajan on August 
17 to discuss the operation and possible coordination among their 
movements.  Yahia noted that on August 18, there was no direct 
fighting between GoS forces and the rebel movements, but that the 
government intends to use this military buildup "to continue its 
genocidal policies."  Kado stated that the GoS now deployed three 
brigades to the region around Wadi Atrun Karab Atom, and Wadi Howar. 
 He said that the GoS has conducted aerial bombing in the last week 
resulting in 12 civilian deaths.  Per reftel, Kado stated that GoS 
oil interests in the region are motivating the SAF deployment to 
North Darfur.  Both Yahia and Kado dismissed President Bashir's 
Darfur People's Initiative as a ploy following the ICC proceedings. 
"How can the government broadcast its peace initiatives while a war 
is going on.  The GoS is not serious about peace while it drops 
bombs and its troops fire their guns," stated Yahia. 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - - 
¶6.  (SBU)  Yahia and Kado were consistent in their support of the 
ICC, even if it means having a negative impact on them or their 
movement.   This is easy to say now, as Ocampo has not yet requested 
an indictment for any members of SLA/Unity.  Although Unity leaders 
acknowledged ongoing communication with Minnawi, they downplayed the 
extent of their coordination with SLM/MM.  Yahia's emphasis on the 
limits of this coordination, "as long as Minnawi is part of the 
government," clearly demonstrates Yahia's hope for Minnawi's 
withdrawal from the GoS and combined SLM/Unity-MM military 
operations. Although not as strong as JEM or widely supported as 
 
KHARTOUM 00001258  002 OF 002 
 
 
Abdul Wahid, Unity is regarded by many observers as one of the most 
important movements that could make or break any future peace deal. 
 Having already communicated with JEM, SLA/AW, and SLM/MM, Djibril 
Bassole and his staff should immediately reach out to SLM/Unity 
leaders such as Kado and Yahia. 
 
BIO NOTE 
- - - - - 
¶7.  (SBU)  Originally from the Nuba Mountains, Abubaker Mohamed Kado 
is a former army and Popular Defense Force Officer turned rebel 
commander.  Kado has a long history of involvement in Sudan's wars, 
leading a unit of the Sudan Democratic Federal Alliance in Eastern 
Sudan and later fighting with multiple iterations of the Sudan 
Liberation Army in Darfur.  Kado stated that he has "been in the 
field actively fighting since 1996 and will continue to be there 
until there is real change in Sudan."
