SUBJECT: IMF RESIDENT DISMISSES EFFECT OF U.S. SANCTIONS AND 
CONVERSION TO EURO 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  In a November 20 meeting with PolChief and 
EconOff, the resident representative of the International Monetary 
Fund in Sudan, Wabel Abdallah labeled the Central Bank of Sudan's 
decision to convert its reserves to the euro as unrealistic, 
dismissed the effect of U.S. sanctions on the Sudanese economy, and 
described the 2008 budget for the Government of National Unity (GNU) 
as the first transparent budget ever in Sudan.  Abdallah also 
acknowledged the influence of government parastatals on the Sudanese 
economy.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Abdallah was dismissive of the Central Bank of Sudan's 
plan to convert all dollar reserves into euros by the end of 2007. 
He noted that a very large percentage of direct foreign investment 
into Sudan comes from the Arab Gulf states.  He stated that these 
Arab investors receive oil revenue in dollars, have grown accustomed 
to the ease and universality of the dollar, and that it is unlikely 
they will abandon it in international transactions. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Abdallah stated that U.S. sanctions no longer have an 
impact on the Sudanese economy.  He stated that the government and 
private sector have grown accustomed to doing business in this 
environment and that they have found alternatives and ways around 
the sanctions.  He noted that Sudanese are not afraid of further 
U.S. actions, but worry about European countries imposing their own 
sanctions, as they have come to rely upon European investment, 
businesses, and services.  He noted widespread corruption, in 
particular in the South, as a major challenge facing Sudan. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Abdallah recently served as an advisor and consultant for 
the 2008 budget for the Government of National Unity.  He said that 
the budget will meet international standards and will offer an 
unprecedented level of transparency in Sudan.  Abdallah added that 
another advisor from the IMF will soon arrive in Juba to provide 
similar budget assistance to the Government of South Sudan. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Abdallah said that many Sudanese government ministries 
operate with a significant degree of financial autonomy and maintain 
their own independent sources of income.  He cited the Sudanese 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) as an example, claiming that the 
MFA is currently constructing a new office building without any 
direct budgetary support from the Ministry of Finance or the GNU. 
He also acknowledged the widespread influence of government 
parastatals on Sudan's economy.  He stated that the profits from 
semi-private businesses benefit individuals loyal to the regime 
and/or provide an alternative source of funding for government 
ministries. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Bio Note:  Abdallah was born in Lebanon, and as the son 
of an Ambassador lived in many different countries, including Iran, 
during his childhood.  While earning his PhD at Columbia University, 
Abdallah worked at the United Nations in New York.  He has worked at 
the International Monetary Fund for the last ten years.  He is 
married and his wife and children reside in Virginia.
