Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  Flooding that began in mid-August along the Nile River has 
affected more than 100,000 people in the northern, central, and 
eastern regions of Sudan.  The most severely affected areas include 
the towns of Omdurman, Tokar, and Sinnar State.  Humanitarian 
concerns for flood-affected areas include the spread of acute watery 
diarrhea and cholera, availability of safe drinking water, and 
shelter.  The non-governmental organization (NGO) Sudanese Red 
Crescent Society (SRCS) reported that current water levels in the 
Blue Nile River are already higher than the 1988 levels that caused 
severe flooding in Sudan.  End summary.

Northern Sudan - Khartoum and Omdurman 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On August 11 and 12, violent storms in Omdurman town located 
approximately seven km north of Khartoum, damaged the makeshift 
shelters of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and affected more 
than 15,000 IDP households in Omdurman IDP camps and settlements, 
according to the Government of National Unity (GNU) Humanitarian Aid 
Commission (HAC).  NGOs reported that the floods affected 10,000 IDP 
families in Es Salaam camp alone.  On August 15, USAID staff joined 
an inter-agency joint assessment mission to the Omdurman area and 
reported that the greatest needs include shelter, sanitation, and 
food.  USAID partner CARE has ongoing health and nutrition projects 
in Es Salaam camp and is currently assessing how to best meet the 
needs of the flood-affected population in coordination with other 
NGOs and the Khartoum State Government.  Other relief agencies have 
provided shelter and relief commodities to victims in a coordinated 
response led by the Khartoum State Government. 
 
¶3.  USAID staff conducted a follow-up visit to the affected areas on 
August 23 and confirmed that distributions of relief supplies and 
shelter materials were taking place.  However, USAID staff noted 
that additional shelter materials were required to meet the needs of 
all IDPs in Es Salaam camp and other affected areas. 
 
¶4.   Flooding in the town of Wad Medani, south of Khartoum in Gezira 
State, has killed six people and damaged nearby villages, according 
to SRCS.  The banks of the Blue Nile River could possibly overflow 
causing further damage in the town.  Local media reported that the 
rising waters of the White Nile River destroyed more than 300 houses 
in the Kalakla area of Khartoum on August 21.

Eastern and Central Sudan - Sinnar and Red Sea States 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶5.  Rising levels of the Gash and Baraka rivers in eastern Sudan and 
the Blue Nile River in several states, especially Sinnar, have 
displaced entire villages.  As of August 20, the flooding from the 
Blue Nile River had killed several people in Sinnar State and 
damaged more than 1,600 shelters, according to the GNU HAC.  Relief 
agencies have established twelve camps to aid people displaced from 
60 affected villages in Sinnar, according to SRCS.  SRCS has 
provided relief assistance to flood-affected areas in Sinnar. 
Washed-out roads and bridges have limited access to the flooded 
areas. 
 
¶6.  Working with SRCS, the International Federation of the Red Cross 
and Red Crescent Societies has appealed for USD 543,000 to provide 
relief commodities for 3,000 families and plans to send two response 
teams to affected areas. 
 
¶7.  Flooding may have caused a spike in new cases of acute watery 
diarrhea, with reports of hundreds of new cases, according to SRCS. 
The U.N. Children's Fund has confirmed cases of cholera in Sinnar 
State and plans to distribute health kits in cholera-affected areas. 
 The GNU civil defense distributed more than 1,000 tents in affected 
states and is requesting 3,000 additional tents, as well as 
blankets, food, generators, and insecticide spraying equipment. 
 
¶8.  In Tokar, located south of Port Sudan in Red Sea State, Oxfam 
reported that flooding from the Baraka River and delta has affected 
at least 6,000 households. The Sudanese government is trying to 
strengthen dikes in the area to avert a greater flooding problem. 
NGOs report that in Tokar the greatest humanitarian needs include 
shelter materials, sanitation assistance, and the removal of

standing water to reduce the spread of disease.  USAID partner 
International Rescue Committee has contributed 80 plastic sheets. 
Oxfam and the Sudan Sea Ports Corporation are conducting other 
relief activities. 
 
¶9.  Authorities in Kassala town located near the Eritrean border, 
continue to carefully monitor the flow of the Gash River that 
originates in the mountains of Eritrea, which can strengthen rapidly 
under heavy rains.  Due to heavy rains upstream, the Algash River 
rose to high levels during the week of August 14 without causing 
serious damage.  However, further rains could quickly result in 
additional flooding along the river.  USAID partner GOAL has stocked 
1,000 family relief kits in preparation for future flooding.

Comment 
-------- 
 
¶10.   USAID staff have observed that in Khartoum, river levels are 
high, which could cause widespread flooding in the days ahead. 
USAID has conducted two assessments to flood-affected IDP camps and 
settlements in Khartoum State and continues to monitor river levels. 
 USAID staff have coordinated and planned contingency responses with 
NGO partners in the event that GNU agencies and other local agencies 
do not have the capacity to respond adequately to this flooding.
