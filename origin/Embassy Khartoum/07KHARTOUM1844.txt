has not approved its offer of a Multi-Role Logistics Company, while 
the Chinese Embassy confirms the arrival of Chinese UN blue-helmeted 
peacekeepers.  End Summary. 
 
TROOP CONTRIBUTING COUNTRIES LAST TO KNOW 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Jordanian emboff Walid Alqazaz told poloff on November 24 
that Jordan has not received a formal approval from GOS on Jordan's 
offer of an unspecified number of transport helicopters comprising 
the Multi-Role Logistics Company (MRLC), to be deployed at 
El-Geneina.  He added that GOS also has not approved Jordan's offer 
of two contingents of 120 anti-riot police and 100 police monitors. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to UN deployment information dated November 14, 
the main body of Jordan's MRLC is scheduled to arrive in 
mid-February and conduct a Pre-Deployment Visit (PDV) for the 
Multi-role Logistics Company starting December 1 to 6.  Alqazaz was 
unable to confirm the start date of the PDV. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Alqazaz was unable to state the number of helicopters 
comprising the Multi-role Logistics Company. Alqazaz added that he 
was surprised at Assistant Secretary-General for Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) Edmond Mulet's recent public 
statements (ref A) that no country has offered helicopters that met 
the UN standards.  He said the Jordanian mission to the UN plans to 
confirm whether DPKO meant that Jordan's offer of helicopter was 
unsatisfactory. 
 
CHINESE PEACEKEEPERS ARRIVE WITH BLUE HELMETS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Despite President Bashir's prominent statements in the 
media insisting that incoming UNAMID peacekeepers should not wear 
blue helmets, but rather should have an AU helmet, the Chinese 
engineering company was shown prominently on the cover of Sudanese 
dailies arriving in Darfur with blue head gear.  Chinese Embassy 
political officer Shen Ang confirmed to poloff November 25 that the 
first tranche (ref B) of 135 Chinese peacekeepers arrived on 
November 24 wearing blue scarves and headgear.
