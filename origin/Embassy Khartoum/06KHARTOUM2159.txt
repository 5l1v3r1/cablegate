REF:  STATE 00142147 
 
¶1.  Because of U.S. sanctions, there are currently no USAID programs 
in Sudan specifically in support of the objectives of the Global 
Internet Task Force (GIFT).  No funds have been allocated for 
programs to provide access to the Internet mentioned in para 6 of 
reftel for either 2005 or 2006.  USAID is barred from providing 
assistance to the Government of National Unity of Sudan.  U.S. 
companies are not allowed to transact business in Sudan and 
sanctions prohibit the import of U.S. equipment or the provision of 
services to Sudan by U.S. firms. 
 
¶2.  However, two USAID projects in Southern Sudan have indirectly 
assisted with IT training and improved IT access.  In the first, a 
USAID funded project in conjunction with the U.S. Census Bureau has 
helped train local staff on data entry and processing.  A second 
project helped to develop and install a financial MIS to track 
Government of Southern Sudan expenditures and provided training in 
computer literacy to the financial management staff.
