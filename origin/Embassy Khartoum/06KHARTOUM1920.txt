SUBJECT:  UN SECURITY STATISTICS FOR DARFUR REGION 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) At an August 9, 2006, briefing for NGOs in Sudan, a senior 
United Nations security officer reported the following statistics 
concerning the security situation in Darfur: 
 
-- Overall security incidents have increased 123%; 
 
-- Security incidents against UN interests have decreased 10%; 
 
-- Security incidents against NGOs have increased 75.9%; 
 
-- Security incidents against the African Union have increased 
912.5%; 
 
-- Armed clashes have increased 100%; 
 
-- Car-jackings have increased 230%; and 
 
-- Banditry has increased 40%. 
 
(Note:  All statistics are based on a comparison of incidents from 
February through July, 2006, to the same time period in 2005.  End 
Note.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU) COMMENT:  These statistics (which include security 
incidents inside internally displaced person (IDP) camps) represent 
a disturbing trend.  Due to the deteriorating security situation, 
the same UN security officer advised against any large delegations 
visiting IDP camps in Darfur.  RSO Khartoum later confirmed that 
armed AU troops do not currently patrol inside the camps and are 
generally unwelcome.  Without the assistance of armed AU troops, 
Embassy Khartoum lacks the necessary resources required to ensure 
the safety and security of a large group visiting a Darfur IDP camp. 
 END COMMENT.
