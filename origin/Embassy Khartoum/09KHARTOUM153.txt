SUBJECT: SHURA COUNCIL MEMBERS PROMISE TO ISSUE PUBLIC DECLARATION 
OF DARFURIANS' SUPPORT FOR DOHA TALKS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: In a February 4 meeting with Senior Representative 
for Sudan Tim Shortley, Shura Council representatives from the Fur, 
Tunjur, Dajo and Birgit tribes expressed a willingness to issue a 
public declaration of the intent of the Darfurian people to pursue 
peace negotiations with the Government of National Unity in Doha. 
Such an announcement, which they hope to make in advance of (or 
immediately after) the issuance of an ICC arrest warrant against 
President Bashir, would be contingent upon their forthcoming 
consultation with SLA/AW Field Commanders, IDP representatives, and 
other civil society members, they said. The Shura Council leaders 
described plans to convene a conference of over 250 civil society 
leaders in the coming days to advance this cause, which they hope 
will spur the recalcitrant Abdul Wahid Nur to accept peace talks. 
Shortley pledged support for their initiative and advised them to 
coordinate closely with the JMST, Joint Chief Mediator Bassole, and 
Embassy Khartoum. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On February 3, Senior Representative for Sudan Shortley met 
with Shura Council members from several of Darfur's indigenous 
African tribes, including Dr. Idris Yousif Ahmed and El Amin Mahmoud 
Mohamed Osman (Fur), Jafaar Ibrahim Adam (Dajo), Tag Eldeen Siddig 
Ahmed (Birgit), and Ibrahim Ahmed Adam (Tunjur). (Note: Shura 
Councils are consultative councils made up of traditional tribal 
leaders. End Note.) Poloff served as notetaker. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Shura Council members expressed the urgency of seizing 
any available opportunity to pursue peace, and expressed frustration 
and dismay with the recalcitrance of Fur leader Abdul Wahid Al Nur. 
El Amin Mahmoud Mohamed Osman, noting that Abdul Wahid is his close 
personal relative, lamented that "we can no longer allow one 
individual to control the destiny of our people," and expressed 
worry that the Fur leader would become even more defiant after the 
ICC announcement. They acknowledged regretfully, however, that there 
is no clear alternative now to take his place. 
 
4.(SBU) As a result of this dilemma, the Shura Council expressed a 
willingness to take on the mantle of the Darfurian people and issue 
a declaration of their intention to pursue to pursue peace, 
contingent upon a series of consultations with SLA/AW Field 
Commanders, IDP Camp representatives and other civil society. "As 
Shura Council we don't have a direct role in the political process 
per se," stated Dr. Idris Yousif Ahmed, "but at the same time civil 
society has an important contribution to make" at peace talks.  They 
described the issue of Darfur as one region as paramount to any 
negotiations, and urged a strong USG presence at peace talks if and 
when they occur. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Shura Council Members told Shortley that they plan to 
convene a conference of approximately 250 civil society leaders in 
the coming days and to initiate consultations with a wide range of 
parties prior to making a public announcement, which they hoped 
would spur Abdul Wahid into acceptance of the Doha talks, lest he be 
bypassed altogether. Understanding that time is of the essence, they 
hope to make announcement before (or immediately after) the ICC 
announcement. Shortley pledged support for their initiative and 
advised that they coordinate the announcement closely with the JMST, 
Joint Chief Mediator Bassole, and Embassy Khartoum. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Regarding the situation on the ground in Darfur, the Shura 
Council members expressed grave concern at the possibility of 
retaliation against civilians from government and government-backed 
militias in the wake of the ICC announcement. They were also 
extremely troubled by the recent bombing in Muhajiriya. They noted 
that a UNAMID pullout from the town would have been "catastrophic", 
and emphasized the need for a no-fly zone to halt such aerial 
bombardments. They also expressed concern that, in their estimation, 
over 200,000 migrant Arab nomads from Chad and other countries have 
moved into Darfur and occupied indigenous lands. This has occurred 
mostly in West Darfur, but also in North and South Darfur as well, 
they said. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment: To date, the efforts of Darfuri civil society to 
advance the peace process have been characterized by a lack of 
coordination, overlapping efforts, and clashes of personality. 
Though civil society groups may be intellectually and morally better 
suited to promote peace and reconciliation than the rebels, no one 
civil society group or affiliation can rightfully claim to represent 
all Darfurians. However, a public announcement as proposed by a 
respected group of tribal leaders such as the Shura Council would 
get attention and could advance the process. Given the current 
stalemate in Darfur, any attempt to spur the recalcitrant Abdul 
Wahid, or to find alternatives to his leadership from within the Fur 
community, should be encouraged. 
 
¶8. (U) This message was cleared by Senior Representative Shortley 
prior to his departure.
