¶1. (SBU) New Deputy Director of the UNAMID Liaison office in 
Khartoum Aziz "Peter" Iskandar discussed UNAMID deployment issues 
with poloffs on July 1.  Iskandar, a career UN administrator, 
arrived in Khartoum in early June to work in UNAMID's Khartoum-based 
liaison office.  The small office on the UNMIS compound, which 
formerly served only to forward diplomatic notes to the MFA and 
arrange travel to and from Darfur, will now serve as a key office 
for managing UNAMID administrative and logistics issues in Khartoum. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Asked how the UN plans to ensure continuity and progress on 
projects conducted by PAE, Iskandar said that GOS officials 
continually remind him that DPKO A/SYG Jane Holl-Lute promised the 
GOS that PAE would not be granted any more extensions and will leave 
Sudan by July 14.  Given this promise, Iskandar said he has no 
option other than to plan for PAE's departure, but identified 
several avenues that the UN will explore to replace them.  These 
include increasing the use of UNAMID's own TCC contingent engineers, 
relying on local Sudanese contractors for construction - and 
providing technical expertise via training programs to local 
companies, and advocating that PAE use their local partners in Sudan 
to hire experienced PAE individual contractors.  He said that the 
use of UNAMID military contingent engineers will likely not work, as 
they are good at building roads and perhaps drilling wells, but not 
more technical construction and maintenance work.  The problem with 
the other avenues such as local contractors is that they lack a 
robust procurement capability, which is difficult to replace. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Iskandar opined that PAE should have considered the use of 
Sudanese partners or offshore front companies before bidding as 
contractor, knowing that their U.S. association would make them 
targets by the GOS.  He said the use of front companies would be 
particularly useful to keep the APC maintenance technicians 
available.  However, Iskandar admitted that the use of partners to 
front for PAE contractors and technicians would be difficult to sell 
to UN bureaucrats "who lack an entrepreneurial culture."  In the 
case of food service, Iskandar said there may be no choice but to 
use a front company to retain the current PAE subcontractor, the 
Italian caterer ESCO.  Iskandar said that due to its contract with 
PAE, ESCO cannot assume another contract while they are working for 
PAE (there is a six-month non-compete clause). 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Iskander's positive "can-do" attitude is a 
departure from the usual UN bureaucratic stance. His ability to make 
decisions and advocate on behalf of PAE has enabled PAE to do "four 
months of work in four weeks" in the words of PAE management. 
Nonetheless, PAE is unlikely to work through front companies at this 
late hour, and Iskandar and UNAMID are likely to be left on their 
own with little support from DPKO.
