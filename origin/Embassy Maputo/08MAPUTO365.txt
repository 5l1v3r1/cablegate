SUBJECT: TSVANGIRAI VISITS MOZAMBIQUE 
 
¶1.  (U) Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of Zimbabwe's opposition 
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) visited Maputo on April 
¶23.  The visit was personally coordinated by the leader of 
Mozambique's opposition party Renamo, Afonso Dhlakama, who 
arranged for Tsvangirai to meet with former president Joaquim 
Chissano and current president Armando Guebuza.  In a press 
conference at Dhlakama's residence at the end of his visit, 
Tsvangirai said that he had met with Chissano, as the 
 
SIPDIS 
chairman of the forum of African former heads of state, to 
request that he lend influence to resolve the electoral 
crisis in Zimbabwe. 
 
¶2.  (U) Tsvangirai said that he had raised three issues in 
all his meetings in Maputo: first, the ongoing violence that 
is causing a humanitarian crisis.  By his count he indicated 
that eleven people have been killed, 400 detained, and 
thousands others somehow affected.  Second, he said that he 
had asked for assistance in bringing the violence to an end. 
Third, he expressed concerns at the delay in releasing the 
results of the presidential vote.  Tsvangirai said that he 
believed President Guebuza would like to see the crisis 
resolved through dialoque and not violence.  Asked if he 
would be willing to participate in a runoff, Tsvangirai said 
he would address this issue only if the results of the 
election were released. 
 
¶3.  (U) Separately, former President Chissano told the press 
on April 24 that he advised Tsvangirai that Chissano could 
only get involved in finding a solution for Zimbabwe if the 
heads of state of SADC requested that he do so.  President 
Guebueza has not yet commented on the content of his meeting 
with Tsvangirai. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Tsvangirai did not appear to cover any 
new ground during his visit to Mozambique, and as yet we have 
no reaction from the GRM about his meeting with Guebuza.  But 
Tsvangirai did himself no favors with the GRM by so publicly 
 
SIPDIS 
aligning himself with Renamo's leader Dhlakama.  Always the 
opportunist, Dhlakama took the spotlight during Tsvangirai's 
visit, positioning himself as a senior mediator who is 
working to ensure regional democracy.  At the same time, the 
Renamo leader is using the increased attention to campaign 
for the 2009 presidency, indirectly suggesting that a vote 
for the incumbent Frelimo party might result in the same 
state of affairs in Mozambique that Zimbabwe is suffering 
now.  One beneficial aspect to the Tsvangirai visit is that 
an increasing number of Mozambican civic organizations, 
including the press, are questioning more and more the GRM's 
policy of "quiet diplomacy" towards the brewing crisis next 
door.  END COMMENT.
