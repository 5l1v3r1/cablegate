SUBJECT: MOZAMBIQUE: PRESIDENT GUEBUZA'S REMARKS TO 
REPORTERS ON HAMAS ELECTION WIN 
 
¶1.  (U) President Guebuza attended the just-concluded World 
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he participated 
on a panel on Chinese investment in Africa.  On January 30, 
while speaking to reporters shortly before returning home to 
Mozambique, he was asked for his reaction to the victory by 
Hamas in the Palestinian elections.  According to the press, 
Guebuza responded that his government would act in accordance 
with rules governing relations between states.   He said that 
Mozambique's ruling party, FRELIMO, had longstanding 
relations with Fatah, but that this would not be an obstacle 
to good relations with Hamas.  Guebuza underlined, however, 
that whenever possible Mozambique would urge Hamas "to adopt 
a policy that favors continued dialog in the region, always 
in support of peace for all." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  Fatah and FRELIMO have had friendly ties 
dating back to before Mozambique's independence in 1975, when 
FRELIMO viewed the PLO as partners in "the struggle for 
self-determination."  Yassir Arafat came to Maputo to pay his 
respects during the funeral for Samora Machel, Mozambique's 
first president, in October 1986.  The Palestinian embassy 
sits on a street corner across from the Mozambican presidency 
complex.
