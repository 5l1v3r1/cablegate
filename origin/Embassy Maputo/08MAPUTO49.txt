SUBJECT: ARCHBISHOP COMPARES POLITICAL SITUATION TO 
ZIMBABWE'S 
 
REF: 07 MAPUTO 1344 
 
¶1.  (U) In a recent interview with the journal 'Magazine 
Independente,' Jaime Pedro Goncalves, Archbishop of Beira 
(Mozambique's second largest city), expressed concern at what 
he views as political discrimination against pro-Renamo 
regions of the country.  Perceived as a Renamo supporter, he 
indicated these areas receive less commercial investment from 
the Frelimo-controlled central government and suffer higher 
levels of unemployment than the national average.  He also 
suggested that authorities in these 
regions routinely detain Renamo supporters without charge. 
The Archbishop said that if this discrimination on the basis 
of political affiliation persisted, there would be the 
potential danger of Mozambique plunging into an atmosphere of 
violence, albeit not necessarily outright armed conflict, 
arguing that "in Zimbabwe there is no armed conflict, but 
also there is no peace." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) COMMENT: Goncalves is considered to be one of the 
most influential bishops in the Catholic Conference of 
Mozambique, of which he once served as secretary-general, and 
in the Catholic Church hierarchy in Southern Africa.  The 
Archbishop played a prominent role in the negotiations that 
led to the signing of the Rome Peace Accords in 1992.  He 
also belongs to the same tribe as Renamo leader Afonso 
Dhlakama.  Goncalves is normally outspoken, but that he would 
make comments so openly critical of the ruling Frelimo party 
while drawing parallels to the situation in Zimbabwe is 
unusually forward-leaning.  This may portend additional 
criticism of the Frelimo party by opposition parties in 
upcoming elections in 2008 and 2009.  END COMMENT.
