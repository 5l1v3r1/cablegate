¶1.  PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VISIT TO ASIA 
 
"Obama steps onto the big Asian stage" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/13)(pg 1): "According to U.S. media, a new 
world order has arrived.  Professor Jin Canrong at People's 
University of China said that Obama's visit to Asia is different in 
that he does not have the superiority of previous U.S. Presidents. 
Yuan Peng at the China Institute of International Relations said 
that Europe is the United States' past and Asia is its present and 
future.  U.S.-Europe relations are value-oriented, while U.S.-Asia 
relations are interest-oriented, which is why it is difficult to 
tell which set of relations are more important for the United 
States.  For Americans, trans-Pacific relations are crucial for 
influencing the world's future.  Japan and Europe are watching 
Obama's visit closely, and with uneasiness.  Obama's stay in China 
is the longest of his trip, which is seen as an indication of the 
most important agenda items on his visit.  Professor Jin argued 
although the big changes China has gone through have made the West 
uneasy, there is in fact no need for the West to worry since, 
despite the rapid development of China, its per capita GDP is still 
low.  As a result, China will focus on domestic issues instead of 
foreign expansion like the West." 
 
¶2.  U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"How should China respond to the United States' return to Southeast 
Asia?" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(11/13)(pg 3): "Professor Zhang Xizhen at the 
School of International Studies at Peking University argued that 
China has made substantial progress in cooperating with ASEAN.  The 
ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA) will finally be announced next 
year.  Zhang said China should focus on North East Asian cooperation 
as such cooperation will be very influential once it is established. 
 Because the cooperation between China, Japan and South Korea does 
not have much to do with the United States, the United States has no 
right to join this mechanism.  The East Asian order is not currently 
beneficial to China since the U.S. and its allies - Japan, South 
Korea and the Philippines - are on one side and China is all alone 
on the other side.  However, due to the financial crisis, there has 
been a shift in the U.S.-Japan alliance.  China should use this 
opportunity to push for the establishment of an equitable trilateral 
framework between the United States, Japan and China.  ASEAN 
countries are skillful at balancing the influence of the big powers. 
 They know that the big powers all want to expand their influence in 
the region, and thus they avoid tilting towards any one country 
simply because it provides more assistance." 
 
¶3.  TIBET 
 
"China urges U.S. to respect its stance on Tibet" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao)(11/13)(pg 8): "On November 12, Chinese Foreign Ministry 
Spokesperson Qin Gang urged the United States to respect China's 
core interests concerning Tibet.  President Obama mentioned 
previously that he is grateful to President Lincoln, who played a 
critical role in maintaining the unity and territorial integrity of 
the United States and without whom he would not have become the 
first African American President.  We hope that President Obama can 
better and more deeply understand China's position in maintaining 
its sovereignty and territorial integrity.  To a certain extent, the 
feudal system run by the Dalai Lama in the old Tibet is the same as 
the system of slavery in America that was abolished by President 
Lincoln.   Qin said the U.S. government should also listen to the 
voice of the Chinese public.  Ninety percent of netizens who 
participated in an online poll expressed firm opposition to a 
possible meeting between Obama and the Dalai Lama.  [Speaking about 
Obama's visit to China,] Qin said, 'Apart from political meetings, 
Obama will have opportunities to interact with Chinese youth during 
his stay in Shanghai, (details of) which are being finalized."
