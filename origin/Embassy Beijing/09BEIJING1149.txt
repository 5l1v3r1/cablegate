SUBJECT: CHINA EXPRESSES CONCERN OVER OCTG AND TIRES TRADE CASES 
 
1.(SBU) SUMMARY:  On April 27, the Charge met with Ministry of 
Commerce (MOFCOM) Vice Minister Zhong Shan at Zhong's request to 
discuss two recent U.S. trade remedy petitions regarding OCTG (steel 
pipe) and consumer tires.  The Chinese requested the U.S. exercise 
prudence in the cases, arguing that the difficulties of U.S. 
industries were caused by the economic downturn and that trade 
remedy measure would be unlikely to help.  China also noted that the 
actions could set a negative precedent for third countries eager to 
justify protectionist trade measures, and were counterproductive to 
our joint efforts to fight the global financial crisis (GFC).  The 
Charge said the USG would take Chinese concerns into account to the 
extent allowed by U.S. trade law. END SUMMARY. 
 
OCTG AND TIRE CASES VERY IMPORTANT TO CHINA 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On April 27, the Charge met with MOFCOM Vice-Minister Zhong 
Shan, at MOFCOM's request, to discuss two recent trade case 
petitions for steel pipe and tires.  The two petitions of concern to 
the Chinese are an antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) 
petition on oil country tubular goods (OCTG) filed by U.S. producers 
to the U.S. Commerce Department (DOC) and a China-specific 421 
safeguard petition regarding consumer tires filed with the U.S. 
International Trade Commission (USITC).  Due to MOFCOM Minister Chen 
Deming's current visit to the U.S. on a trade mission, the Chinese 
side was represented by VM Zhong, as well as three deputy-director 
generals (DDGs) from the Department of Foreign Trade, the Department 
of Treaty and Law, and the Bureau of Fair Trade for Imports and 
Exports. 
 
CHINA REQUESTS U.S. PRUDENCE 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) VM Zhong opened by stressing the mutual importance of 
commercial relations between the U.S. and China, and said that given 
the current GFC, the two countries must work closely together to 
resolve trade friction and avoid protectionist measures.  He stated 
that China attaches great importance to the OCTG and tires 
petitions, not only because of the large number of Chinese producers 
involved, but also for the example it sets for third countries.  VM 
Zhong noted that the timing of the cases had not been in favor of 
finding a solution, but he believes that a resolution to the issue 
is in the interest of our combined efforts to counter the GFC.  He 
hopes the U.S. will exercise prudence regarding these two cases. 
 
TRADE CASES WON'T HELP U.S. INDUSTRY 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) VM Zhong expressed his view that even if the USG implements 
trade remedy measures for the two petitions, these actions would be 
unlikely to help the U.S. OCTG and tire industries.  He thus 
believes it makes more sense for the two countries to find a 
mutually agreeable solution.  China believes the current situation 
of U.S. producers may have been caused by slack demand due to the 
economic slowdown.  GOC and Chinese industry remain open to discuss 
arrangements on prices and quantities to promote development of 
these industries. 
 
U.S. SHOULD CONSIDER THE LARGER TRADE PICTURE 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) VM Zhong noted that the GOC also receives industry pressure 
on trade.  During the National People's Congress (NPC) in March, 
many NPC deputies requested to meet with him to express their 
concerns over the restrictions on exports to the U.S. of Chinese 
cooked chicken, or regarding imports to China of U.S. soybeans. 
These concerns are understandable, but MOFCOM considered the overall 
bilateral trade picture and helped persuade industry of the benefits 
of the broader relationship.  He hoped the USG would also work to 
help its industry understand the benefits of trade. 
 
CHINA HOPES TO AVOID A TRADE WAR 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) VM Zhong expressed MOFCOM's concern that given the GFC, if 
the two countries fail to resolve these cases and the result is 
trade remedy measures, it will embolden third countries to use 
similar methods to protect domestic industry.  Some of those 
countries are hoping for a trade war with China.  China believes 
such action would not be in the interest of our common objective to 
resolving the GFC as quickly as possible.  He reemphasized his 
desire to focus on the larger trade picture.  China, as the largest 
developing country, and the U.S., as the most powerful developed 
country, have complementary markets.  VM Zhong is confident that the 
prospects for increased bilateral trade are great.  But he warned 
that if trade friction with the U.S. got out of hand, the two 
countries could risk descending into a trade war.

¶7. (SBU) The Charge thanked VM Zhong for his frank opinions, and 
promised to report the GOC concerns to the USG.  He stated the U.S. 
understands the importance China attaches to the two petitions, as 
evidenced by the high-level representation at the meeting.  But the 
petition themselves originated from similar concerns, and were 
initiated by U.S. industry and unions representing U.S. workers.  As 
such, the USG is under a legal obligation to consider these requests 
and conduct investigations if the petitions meet the requirements of 
U.S. trade law.  He noted that if, as required by law, there is a 
decision to proceed on the OCTG case, it does not mean that our 
dialogue has failed.  He asked that the GOC respect the U.S. 
process, which would include careful investigation and analysis 
before any recommendation or action. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The Charge concluded by emphasizing that as close trading 
partners, it is natural for China and the U.S. would have 
differences regarding certain trade matters.  The U.S. appreciates 
the practical approach taken by the GOC on the cooked poultry and 
soybean issues, and looks forward to continued discussion on such 
issues.  The USG is working hard on the poultry issue, and 
appreciates China's efforts on soybeans.  He assured the Chinese 
that the concerns they expressed would be taken seriously by the 
USG.
