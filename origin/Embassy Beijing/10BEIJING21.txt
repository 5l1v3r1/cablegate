¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"Many U.S. think tanks predict Sino-U.S. frictions" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/06)(pg 16): "In regard to the Eurasia 
Group's report that Sino-U.S. relations are likely to worsen and 
become the biggest geo-political risk this year, Professor Jin 
Canrong at Renmin University's Institute of International Relations 
said that the world is stepping away from the impact of the 
international financial crisis and entering the post-crisis era, in 
which countries would be much more likely to fight against each 
other through their competition over economic interests.  The Obama 
administration's political status has declined in the U.S., its 
strength to resist protectionism is also weakened.  However, we do 
not need to exaggerate the impact of Sino-U.S. trade frictions, it 
is just tributary (meaning: not a major problem in U.S.-Sino 
relations).  However China should stay wary of the possible moves by 
the U.S.  Zhou Shijian, Senior Researcher at Tsinghua University's 
Sino-U.S. Research Center said that if the United States insists on 
wrestling with China, that we, China, also have many cards in our 
hands.  For example, we can take countermeasures to fight back 
against the U.S., one of which would be implementing countervailing 
measures on U.S agricultural products.  As Chairman Mao once said, 
'If we fight for unity, then unity survives; if we compromise for 
unity, then unity dies.'  China has become the world's top exporter; 
the troubles faced by China will certainly increase, for instance, 
not only the pressure from the West, but also trade frictions with 
developing countries, such as Latin America. It is unlikely that the 
West will unite with each other to fight against China since all the 
countries are inclined to fight for their own interests.  Therefore, 
any trade friction will be a one-on-one confrontation, not a 
showdown." 
 
¶2. WAR ON TERROR 
 
"The United States faces the challenge of 'fighting terrorism on 
multiple fronts'" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(01/06)(pg 
3): "Since Obama took office, the counterterrorism policy of the 
U.S. has been constantly adjusted and the focus has been on Pakistan 
and Afghanistan.  But the Christmas Day terror plot will probably 
change U.S. counterterrorism strategy throughout the world.  First, 
the U.S. needs to increase anti-terror forces in Yemen, which has 
become the new place where international terror activities 
originate.  Second, the U.S. once again faces the challenge of 
fighting terrorism on multiple fronts.  Terrorism forces in the 
Middle East, Central Africa, South Asia, Central Asia and Southeast 
Asia have all shown the rising trends.  The old strategy of the U.S. 
which focuses on combating terrorism in South Asia is no longer 
appropriate for the new international situation.  Thus the Christmas 
Day terror plot may even affect international counterterrorism 
efforts." 
 
¶3. NORTH KOREA 
 
"The situation on the Korean Peninsula will hopefully change for the 
better" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(01/06)(pg 
3): "Piao Jianyi, the Director of the Center of Korean Peninsula 
Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, argues that since 
last August, after former U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit, the 
situation on the Korean Peninsula has begun to thaw.  From what 
signals have been sent by the DPRK and South Korea thus far, in 2010 
relations between the two will take a turn for the better.  The year 
of 2010 is a crucial year for North Korea since it believes that 
only a stable North-South Korean relationship will benefit the 
denuclearization process and economic exchanges on the Korean 
Peninsula in 2010.  At this point, one can see that there is a 
general trend towards resuming the Six-Party Talks.  At present, all 
parties are making more efforts to promote the resumption of the 
talks and have made certain progress."
