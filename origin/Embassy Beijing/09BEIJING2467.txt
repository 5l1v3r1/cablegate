¶1. (SBU) Begin Summary: ChinaQs Ministry of Industry 
and Information Technology (MIIT) has drafted a 
report recommending more stringent restrictions on 
the export of rare earth metals and further 
consolidation in the rare earth mining sector over 
the next six years, according to Chinese media. 
Some industry analysts fear the restrictions on 
metals critical for hybrid and electric cars and 
energy efficient light bulb production will lead to 
shortages and higher prices for green technology 
products.  China supplies 87 percent of the global 
rare earth market, and Chinese firms continue to 
seek additional rare earth assets in Australia.  End 
Summary. 
 
Tightening Export Restrictions on Rare Earth Metals 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Chinese media reports, MIITQs 
draft "Special Plan for the Development of the Rare 
Earth Industry 2009 Q 2015," recommends lowering 
ChinaQs current rare earth export quota of 35,000 
tons per year, although the extent of the reduction 
is unclear.  Certain rare earth metals--such as 
terbium, dysprosium, yttrium, thulium and lutetium-- 
will reportedly face complete export 
bans.  According to industry sources, dysprosium is 
a critical component in the electrical systems for 
hybrid and electric cars; terbium and yttrium are 
used in energy efficient light bulbs.  Limiting or 
eliminating the export of these raw materials may 
lead to shortages and higher prices for green 
technology products. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MIITQs draft plan promotes further 
consolidation in ChinaQs rare earth industry, 
specifically calling for the suspension of new 
approvals of rare earth mining rights and licenses 
from 2009 to 2015.  The government will also seek to 
close smaller-scale and less efficient rare earth 
enterprises based on technical, environmental and 
managerial criteria.  The draft report has a 
specific target of reducing the number of smelting 
and separation enterprises from 100 to 20.  (Note: 
The moves to consolidate industry players are 
consistent with government objectives advanced in 
the ten other industry support plans announced 
earlier this year.  End Note.)  The draft report 
solidifies MIIT as the key policy maker and 
supervisor of ChinaQs rare earth industry. 
 
China Sees Strategic Value of Rare Earth Metals 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Given the importance of rare earth 
resources in the manufacture of energy efficiency 
goods and consumer products such as plasma and LCD 
televisions, China last year issued a series of 
measures designed to limit the export of these 
resources and increase oversight of the rare earth 
mining sector.  MOFCOM, for example, reduced the 
number of approved rare earth exporters from 39 
firms to only 20; China previously had 200 rare 
earth export enterprises.  China also imposed a 
35,000 ton per year export quota and raised export 
tariffs. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Peking University Professor Xu Guangxian, 
ChinaQs "father of rare earth," has called for the 
government to set up a rare earth strategic 
reserve.  He expects prices to rise dramatically 
given increasing demand and limited 
supplies.  According to the China Mining Federation, 
China currently supplies 87 percent of the 
international rare earth market.

Chinese Firms Eye Australian Suppliers 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU)In line with ChinaQs broader efforts to 
secure overseas energy and natural resource assets, 
Chinese firms are seeking equity stakes in overseas 
rare earth mining operations.  China Non-Ferrous 
Metal Mining Corporation (CNMC) has offered AUD 252 
million (USD 184 million) for a 51.6 percent stake 
in AustraliaQs Lynas Corporation and has promised 
additional loans of USD 184 million (reftel).  The 
deal is currently under review by AustraliaQs 
Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Another state-owned enterprise, East China 
Exploration and Development Bureau, has been 
approved to purchase a 25 percent stake in Arafura 
Resources, a Perth-based specialty metals exporter.
