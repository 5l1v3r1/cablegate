Stability Serves Burma and International Community 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2. At the September 25 regular MFA press briefing, 
spokeswoman Jiang Yu said stability in Burma serves the 
interests of Burma and the international community and that 
China sticks to a policy of non-interference in the internal 
affairs of other countries, in response to several questions 
on China's reaction to demonstrations in Burma.  China hopes 
and believes Burma's Government and people can handle the 
current situation and achieve stability and economic 
development. 
 
New Japanese PM, China Hopes for Continued Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶3. Jiang expressed China's congratulations to new Japanese PM 
Fukuda, adding that China will adhere to friendly policies 
between China and Japan on the basis of the three joint 
political documents and work together to promote cooperation 
and develop the relationship on a sound and stable track. 
Asked about the status of high-level Government visits 
between China and Japan in the near future, Jiang replied 
that the two sides reached a consensus on this issue last 
year and China is willing to work together with Japan to 
implement that consensus earnestly. 
 
DPRK VFM Kim Kye-gwan in Beijing 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Asked if DPRK VFM Kim Kye-gwan had met with VFM Wu Dawei 
since arriving in Beijing, Jiang said she had not received 
such information.  Chinese heavy fuel assistance to the DPRK 
is under "active preparation and implementation," Jiang said, 
when asked the status of the heavy fuel shipments. 
 
Germany's "Gross Interference" Undermines Relationship 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶5. Chancellor Merkel, "disregarding China's solemn 
representation" on the matter, "insisted" on meeting the 
Dalai Lama, who has long engaged in activities aimed at 
splitting the Motherland, said Jiang when asked why China had 
recently canceled a breakfast meeting between the Chinese and 
German foreign ministers and also a bilateral rule of law 
dialogue.  Jiang continued, the meeting was a "gross 
interference" in China's internal affairs, hurt the feelings 
of the Chinese people and undermined Chinese-German 
relations.  She noted her understanding that the two sides' 
foreign ministers still have plans to meet, at which time FM 
Yang will expound upon China's "solemn position on the Dalai 
Lama issue." 
 
NDRC Vice Chairman to Attend Climate Change Meeting 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶6. NDRC Vice Chairman Xie Zhenhua will attend a meeting to be 
held by President Bush on climate change this week, said 
Jiang, noting that FM Yang attended the UN high-level meeting 
on climate change in New York.  Jiang stated China will 
promote international negotiations in line with the UN 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto 
Protocol and expressed hope that the international community 
will continue to promote the UNFCCC as the main framework for 
climate change and other agreements will promote pragmatic 
cooperation and serve as helpful supplements for the UNFCCC 
and Kyoto Protocol.   China will continue to follow the 
Protocol and Convention as well as the principle of common

but differentiated responsibilities. 
 
Continued Cooperation with Russia 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶7. China has taken note of the new Government appointed by 
President Putin in Russia, Jiang told reporters.  She said 
China stands ready to press ahead with mutually beneficial 
cooperation in various fields between the two nations.
