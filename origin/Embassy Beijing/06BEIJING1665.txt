Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing stated China's 
concern over current developments in the Iran nuclear 
crisis to visiting Iranian National Supervisory 
Council Security Advisor Ali Larijani, MFA 
Spokesperson Kong Quan said at the regular January 26 
MFA Press Briefing.  China considers Russia's proposal 
to provide enriched uranium useful and helpful as a 
way to resume talks, but has not been asked to 
participate in the program.  Beijing opposes the use 
or threat of UNSC economic sanctions.  Although new 
statistics rank China as the world's fourth-largest 
economy, developmental challenges remain and per 
capita GDP is low.  China and Africa will enhance 
their relations by high-level visits and exchanges. 
End Summary. 
 
China Supports Russia's Iran Proposal, Opposes 
Sanctions 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2.  Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing told Larijani China's 
concern over current developments in the Iran nuclear 
crisis and hope that all sides will take concrete 
steps to resolve the impasse, said Kong.  All parties' 
interests are best secured by negotiations.  China 
hopes the parties show patience before the IAEA 
meeting in February and create favorable conditions 
for resumption of the talks. 
 
¶3.  Russia's proposal to provide enriched uranium to 
Iran is a helpful and useful attempt to break the 
deadlock and lead to a resumption of negotiations, 
Kong said.  China has not been asked to participate in 
the Russian proposal but is open to constructive 
proposals to break the present stalemate.  China 
supports Russia's proposal and believes that all 
parties would be wise to restart talks. 
 
¶4.  China's position on UNSC economic sanctions is 
also clear, Kong said: China opposes the use or threat 
of sanctions as counterproductive and they would only 
complicate the issue. 
 
¶5.  China opposes any nuclear proliferation and abides 
by all nuclear protocols and treaties it has signed, 
Kong stated.  All signatories to the NPT have 
commitments and rights to peaceful nuclear energy. 
Member countries need to strictly abide by treaty 
obligations. 
 
China the 4th Largest World Economy? 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶6.  Regarding reports that new economic figures place 
China as the world's fourth-largest economy, Kong said 
that China's people and leaders are proud of their 
progress since the start of economic reforms. 
Nevertheless, China faces significant economic 
challenges and its per capita income is about 100th in 
the world.  The Chinese Government and people will 
make every effort to further develop the country. 
 
China's Africa Policy Developments 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  Regarding China's Africa policy, Kong said that 
China-Africa relations have been well established for 
many years.  China is making preparations to host the 
third annual China-Africa conference in Beijing with 
the goal of making this year's event the first summit- 
level conference.  China's broadening relations with 
Africa feature high-level visits, exchanges, economic 
cooperation and similar views on international and 
regional issues. 
 
¶8.  Kong announced that there will be no MFA press 
conferences next week because of the Spring Festival 
holiday.
