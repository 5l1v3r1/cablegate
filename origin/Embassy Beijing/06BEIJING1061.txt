Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  MFA Spokesperson Kong Quan stated that President 
Hu Jintao will "meet a foreign leader" on Tuesday, 
January 17, in response to repeated questioning about 
the unconfirmed visit of Kim Jong-Il to China.  Kong 
refused to be drawn into specific comment about a 
possible Kim visit, saying he had no authorized 
information to share.  China seeks a peaceful 
resolution of the Iran nuclear crisis.  As one of the 
"London Six," China is concerned about Iran's position 
and urges Iran to return to the negotiating table. 
Kong would not specifically respond to questions about 
referring Iran to the UNSC.  The United States and 
China have begun discussing the agenda for President 
Hu Jintao's 2006 visit to the United States.  The Six- 
Party Talks should not be held up by complicating 
factors and China is in contact with all the Parties. 
The investigation of the Banco Delta Asia, under the 
"one country, two systems" policy, is primarily the 
responsibility of Macau authorities.  King Abdullah of 
Saudi Arabia will visit China January 22-24.  Bahamas 
Foreign Minister Frederick Mitchell will visit China 
January 19-22.  Luxembourg Deputy Premier and Foreign 
Minister Jean Asselborn will visit China January 22- 
¶24.  Chinese Justice Minister Wu Aiying will visit La 
Paz, Bolivia, as China's Special Envoy to the 
inauguration of Evo Morales on January 22.  Chinese 
Deputy Premier Zeng Peiyan will attend the World 
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, January 25-29. 
End Summary. 
 
A Foreign Leader Visits Beijing 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Asked if by NHK Japanese TV if President Hu Jintao 
was meeting any foreign leaders today, MFA Spokesman 
Kong Quan affirmed at the regular January 17 MFA Press 
Briefing that Hu "will meet a foreign leader today." 
Kong brushed aside numerous media requests for 
specific confirmation of the much-reported Kim Jong-Il 
visit to China, saying he had "no authorized 
information to share." 
 
Iran Nuclear Crisis 
------------------- 
 
¶3.  Asked about China's position on the Iran nuclear 
crisis, Kong said it is very important to resolve the 
issue diplomatically and peacefully while respecting 
the interests of all parties.  Kong did not 
specifically respond to questions about whether China 
would support referring Iran to the UNSC.  He said 
China would make the utmost effort for talks to resume 
at an early date and reach a proper solution.  China's 
UN Ambassador Wang Guangya's remarks proposed ways to 
address the problem and urged parties to restart 
negotiations.  Regarding the latest Russian proposal 
to provide enriched uranium to Iran, Kong said the key 
is for Iran to resume negotiations with the EU 3. 
China had "very interesting" contact and consultations 
during Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mehdi Safari's 
January 9-10 visit to Beijing, which included meeting 
with Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing. 
 
Hu Jintao's U.S. Visit in Planning Stages

the United States early this year.  China and the 
United States are holding consultations on the timing 
and agenda for the visit. 
 
The Six-Party Talks: Complicated 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Asked about the status of the Six-Party Talks,

complicating factors.  China is in contact with the 
 
BEIJING 00001061  002 OF 002 
 
 
Parties and hopes all countries will make efforts to 
resume the Talks. 
 
Banco Delta Asia 
---------------- 
 
¶6.  Asked how China views the U.S. sanctions on Banco 
Delta Asia, Kong stated that under the "one country, 
two systems" policy, the investigation is primarily 
the responsibility of Macau authorities. 
 
Saudi King Abdullah's Visit to China Announced 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶7.  King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia will visit China

monarch to China since the countries established 
relations in 1991.  Kong noted that this will be King 
Abdullah's first foreign visit since assuming the 
throne.  Political and energy cooperation will be 
among topics discussed.  China-Saudi trade volume in 
2005 totaled 14 billion USD, an increase of 53 percent 
over the previous year's trade volume.
