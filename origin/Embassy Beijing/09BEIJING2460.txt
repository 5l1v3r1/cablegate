  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a. "Does the U.S. condone CNN's interference in Taiwan issues? (pg 
14)" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(08/27): "What is the real intention behind 
the CNN poll on whether or not Ma Ying Jeou should step down?  Media 
always acts as if it is a guide for public opinions.  What's more, 
the CNN poll has had an obvious slant.  This time, CNN has blatantly 
poked its nose into other people's business.  Even the media and 
people of Taiwan find it hard to accept this behavior.  The 
political inclination of the CNN poll reflects three possibilities: 
first, some of Taiwan's political organizations have infiltrated CNN 
headquarters; second, some political groups may be influencing CNN's 
correspondences in Taiwan; or third, there are many U.S. 
Chinese-American political groups trying to influence U.S. policy on 
China.  In fact, the U.S. often uses 'soft power,' such as CNN, to 
influence world opinion.  Chinese media and people should be 
vigilant about these moves by the U.S." 
 
b. "Speculation as to what Obama might give to China during his 
visit in November (pg 2)" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (08/27): "Zhang 
Guopei of the U.S. Studies Institute at China's Academy of Social 
Sciences said that one of the important tasks for the U.S. 
Ambassador to China is preparing for President Obama's visit in 
November.  We hope that Ambassador Huntsman will achieve great deal 
in U.S.-China business cooperation, trade dispute resolution and 
U.S.-China cultural exchanges, in order to create a more positive 
and harmonious environment for Obama's visit.  Analysts speculate 
that in the next couple of months, the U.S. might give China certain 
benefits in order to create a better atmosphere in advance of 
Obama's visit.  For example, China and the U.S. might reach an 
agreement concerning jointly developing new energy technology.  Jin 
Canrong of the Institute of International Studies at the People's 
University of China believes that the best 'gift' that the U.S. 
could give China would be offering it the 'market-economy 
treatment.'  He also indicates that a second 'gift' would possibly 
be relaxing the limits on China's technology exports.  Analysts' 
further point out that in order to avoid unnecessary trouble, the 
U.S. should avoid moving on issues like Tibetan independence, human 
rights and arms sales to Taiwan. For example, Obama would not meet 
the Dalai during his visit to the U.S. in October.  Mr. Jin said 
that U.S.-China relations have begun well and need to move forward 
slowly." 
 
¶2. U.S. ECONOMY 
 
"Huge U.S. deficit becomes a difficult economic problem (pg A22)" 
 
The official popular newspaper Beijing Youth Daily (Beijing 
Qingnianbao)(08/27): "The U.S. government and Congress have issued 
the highest-ever budget deficit predictions for the next ten years. 
The predictions of the U.S. government and the Congress are 
different from each other mainly because the White House made the 
prediction assuming the government will not increase taxes while 
Congress's predictions are based on the fact that the previous 
administration's tax reductions will take effect by 2011.  However, 
analysts believe that these predictions are not always accurate and 
will change based on future circumstances.  It is foreseeable that 
the budget deficit issue will continue to disturb the U.S. economy 
for a long time."
