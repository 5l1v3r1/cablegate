Public Transport a Priority 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Minister Wang said Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice 
Premier Zeng Peiyan instructed him some years ago to make 
public transportation a priority.  Furthermore, they 
stipulated that public transportation should proceed in a 
way to promote fuel efficiency, environmental protection, 
and land conservation. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Secretary Peters congratulated Wang on the 
progress China has made in the area of public 
transportation.  She stressed the importance of new 
technologies such as signal preemption to encourage 
travelers to take public transportation.  She offered to 
help arrange for representatives from cities in the United 
States that have recent experience with the Olympics such 
as Atlanta or Los Angeles to come to China and share their 
expertise.  She also offered to help arrange a meeting 
between the Minister and Mr. Bill Milar, President of the 
Public Transportation Association.  Wang thanked Peters for 
her offers and expressed a particular interest in meeting 
Milar. 
 
Cooperation on Urban Mass Transportation 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Turning to the soon to be signed QMemorandum of 
Cooperation between the Department of Transportation and 
the Ministry of Construction,Q Wang said it is important 
for both sides to consider commercial areas of cooperation 
in the implementation of the memorandum.  Wang said he 
would like to visit the United States in June or July to 
discuss this, thereby also reciprocating the visits of 
Secretaries Mineta and Peters. China, Wang said, recently 
 
SIPDIS 
passed its first public transit law and numerous Chinese 
cities are working on rail transport and mass surface 
transport systems.  China is also giving serious thought 
about the transportation requirements that would be 
necessary if a large scale evacuation were needed during 
the Olympic Games aQ World Expo.  Wang said China should 
emulate the United States which stresses public transport 
even though it has the worldQs largest number of 
automobiles.  The United States and China should strengthen 
their cooperation in rail transportation and the management 
of surface transportation.

designed to promote cooperation in the field of urban mass 
transportation.
