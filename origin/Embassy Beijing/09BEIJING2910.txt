  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  CONGRESSIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT 
 
"Chinese Foreign Minister asks the U.S. to stop interfering in 
China's internal affairs" 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated to the 
official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (10/20) (pg 1): 
"Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu said that the 
Congressional-Executive Commission on China's annual report distorts 
the facts and interferes in China's affairs.  We (China) suggest the 
Commission stop interfering in China's affairs and damaging 
U.S.-China relations.  Experts said that the [Commission's human 
rights] report will produce antipathy among the Chinese people 
towards U.S. interference in China's affairs.  Given the one hundred 
year of history of being invaded by foreign imperial countries, the 
Chinese people's sensitivity to the interference of foreign 
countries is deep-rooted.  Although the U.S. Congress claims that it 
is concerned about China's human rights, it allocates money to the 
separatists who plotted the March 14 and July 5 violent incidents. 
The Chinese people believe that the attention the U.S. pays to 
China's human rights is driven by ulterior motives.  The 
Commission's human rights report is biased by only giving the view 
of one side, that of the separatists and terrorists.  Such a report 
will not benefit the building of mutual trust between the 
governments and peoples of the two countries." 
 
¶2.  OBAMA VISIT 
 
"Obama should warm up before visiting China" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(10/20)(pg 2): "The U.S. should not expect to be 
rewarded merely for not labeling China as a currency manipulator. 
The U.S. has no basis on which to judge whether or not China has 
manipulated the exchange rate, because China is adopting a floating 
exchange rate under governmental supervision.  The U.S. decision, 
though, is still wise since, given the current financial crisis, a 
trade or exchange rate war would not help any country.  At this 
time, the U.S. needs China more than we need them.  Today, although 
the volume of U.S. imports is decreasing, the percentage of 'made in 
China' products in the U.S. market is increasing.  The U.S. also 
expects China to purchase more government bonds to maintain the 
value of the U.S. dollar.  The success of Obama's upcoming visit to 
China will depend on what measures the U.S. takes to 'warm up' the 
visit, all of which must be sincere." 
 
¶3.  EAST ASIAN COMMUNITY 
 
"U.S. worries about not being able to join the East Asian 
Community" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(10/20)(pg 4): "On October 14, while in Beijing, 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs 
Kurt Campbell said that any important organization related to 
security, economy, or trade [in East Asia] should not exclude the 
U.S.  The U.S. will participate in these types of organizations. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu said, 'Cooperation 
in the Asia-Pacific region is a necessary result of economic 
globalization and regional economic integration.  The region's 
variety has led to the emergence of a multilateral mechanism in the 
region.  China is happy to see the constructive role of the U.S. in 
regional peace, stability, and development, and is ready to step up 
coordination and cooperation with the U.S. in Asia-Pacific affairs.' 
 Experts believe that Ma's remarks do not indicate Chinese support 
for U.S. participation in the [East Asia Community] organization, 
nor do they confirm Campbell's earlier comment about China 
recognizing U.S. participation.  Campbell's statement may be a test 
of China's position and an indication of the U.S.'s anxiety [over 
the East Asian Community proposal]."
