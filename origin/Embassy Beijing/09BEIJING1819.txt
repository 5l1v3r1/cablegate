REF:  STATE 59969 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On June 30, China's National Energy Administration (NEA) 
responded via faxed letter to points conveyed in REFTEL regarding 
China's view towards joining the International Renewable Energy 
Agency (IRENA). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) BEGIN TEXT OF INFORMAL TRANSLATION: 
 
Dear Mr. Brent Christensen 
ESTH Counselor 
June 29, 2009 
 
Following receipt of your letter on June 18, NEA conducted a study 
of the issues surrounding IRENA and the questions you posed in your 
letter.  We would like to share with you our views: 
 
Whether China will join IRENA 
As a special organization, the establishment of IRENA will expand 
the impact of renewable energy globally, enhance the exchange of 
information and technology, and promote a favorable international 
environment for the development of renewable energy policy. 
Currently a number of international energy organizations are setting 
up renewable energy related functions, but it remains unclear how 
these efforts will be coordinated to ensure that all play a positive 
role.  Therefore, China believes it is too early to sign the Statute 
and has no plan to join IRENA at this time. 
 
The location selection of IRENA's headquarter 
The development of renewable energy will rely on global cooperation 
and joint action, therefore geographic location, transportation 
conditions, and other factors should be taken into account when 
selecting IRENA's headquarters.  Initially, the United Arab Emirates 
has proposed to locate the headquarters in Abu Dhabi. We think that 
Abu Dhabi is a city that meets the relevant requirements and should 
be included for priority consideration. 
 
The selection of IRENA's Director-General 
Considering that one of IRENA's key goals is to promote renewable 
energy worldwide, particularly in developing countries, we think it 
is most proper to elect IRENA's Director General from a developing 
country.  This will also attract more developing countries to 
participate in IRENA-related activities. 
 
IRENA's mission, goals and key tasks 
IRENA's mission and goal should be to promote effective development 
and utilization of renewable energy globally; provide a platform to 
exchange information on renewable energy technology and policies for 
countries around the world; and to promote the advancement of 
renewable energy technology and cultivate talent.  The key tasks we 
suggest should include: 
 
-- To help and promote the establishment of renewable energy 
technology and supporting infrastructure in each country; 
 
-- To establish an equal and fair global mechanism for renewable 
energy technology transfer and trade; 
 
-- To jointly study and research renewable applications of power 
grid operations, project construction, operation management, product 
testing and other public technology. 
 
Thank you very much for your letter.  We hope we will continue our 
communications on energy issues of mutual interest. 
 
Best Regards, 
 
Mr. WU Guihui / Director General

END TEXT OF LETTER 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: Although NEA was formally established in March 
2008, it is still experiencing organizational growing pains as it 
consolidates energy policymaking authority from other Chinese 
government organizations.  Moreover, China has yet to pass its 
Renewable Energy Law, which will more clearly define how China will 
engage internationally on this topic.  China may be willing to 
revisit its decision regarding IRENA once it passes a series of 
energy laws currently being debated.  END COMMENT.
