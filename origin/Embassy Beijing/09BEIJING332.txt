Secretary Clinton's Visit to China 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. China hopes for a "deep exchange of views" on "bilateral 
relations, the international financial crisis as well as other 
international and regional issues of mutual interest" during 
Secretary of State Clinton's February 20-22 visit said spokesperson 
Jiang Yu at the February 10 MFA press conference.  Jiang said the 
visit will "strengthen dialogue, increase mutual trust, broaden 
cooperation and push China-U.S. relations on a track of healthy and 
stable development."  The spokesperson noted that the trip will be 
Secretary Clinton's "first visit to China as Secretary of State" and 
is an "important high-level visit." 
 
U.S. Iran Policy 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  Asked whether China supports President Obama's recent statements 
on Iran, Jiang said that China "hopes U.S. Middle East policy can 
help ease tensions in the region to promote the Middle East peace 
process." 
 
UN Human Rights Council Country Review 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  China is "committed to the protection and promotion of human 
rights" and has made "unremitting efforts" toward the development of 
human rights in China.  Chinese citizens currently enjoy "extensive 
rights and freedoms," however "China is currently at the preliminary 
stages of socialism" and therefore human rights in China "faces many 
difficulties, challenges and shortcomings."  China has also "adopted 
a positive attitude toward international cooperation on human 
rights."  China has "signed 25 human rights agreements" and "held 
more than 70 human rights dialogues with nearly 20 countries and 
regions," noted Jiang.  China is "willing to continue to engage in 
constructive dialogue" on human rights, said Jiang. 
 
Italian Award for Dalai Lama 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5. Italy's decision to grant the Dalai Lama an award "seriously 
hurts the feelings of the Chinese people" and China "expresses its 
strong dissatisfaction and protest" said Jiang.  China "hopes Italy 
will pay attention to China's concerns and take immediate, effective 
measures to remove the negative impact and maintain healthy, stable 
development of bilateral ties."  Jiang added that "over recent 
decades" the "Dalai Lama has clearly demonstrated what type of 
person he is."  The Dalai Lama is "not simply a religious figure" 
but has engaged in "splittist and political activities for a long 
time." 
 
Lai Changxing Case 
------------------ 
 
¶6. China is "extremely concerned about Canada's behavior" regarding 
the case of Lai Changxing, a Chinese citizen accused of smuggling 
and recently granted a work permit by Canada.  Jiang said that the 
Chinese Government is "unwavering and consistent" in its position 
that "fugitive Lai Changxing return to face trial under Chinese 
law."  Jiang added that China has "already made serious 
representations to the Canadian side."

Hu Jintao Africa and Saudia Arabia Trip 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Asked about President Hu Jintao's trip to Mali, Senegal, Tanzania 
and Mauritius, Jiang said that the purpose of the trip is to 
strengthen cooperation and bilateral relations with each country. 
Hu "will sign some agreements" during the visits, said Jiang. 
Energy cooperation with African countries "follows the principle of 
win-win" and can help Africa "build an oil-based industrial system" 
and "enhance capacity for self-development." Regarding Hu's recently 
completed trip to Saudia Arabia, Jiang said that China "pays great 
attention to Saudi Arabia's position and role in the energy world 
and is willing to increase energy cooperation further." 
 
China-France Relations 
---------------------- 
 
¶8. China hopes that France will "attach great importance to China's 
core concern" and work positively to "get China-France relations 
back on track."  Jiang said that former French Prime Minister 
Jean-Pierre Raffarin will visit China from February 18-14 during 
which time he will meet with Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, Vice 
Foreign Minister Li Hui and Vice Director of the Chinese Communist 
Party Central Committee International Liaison Department Zhang 
Zhijun.  Raffarin is "an old friend of China" and China hopes his 
visit "will enhance the China-France friendship."  China attaches 
great importance to relations with France and healthy relations are 
conducive to peace and stability, said Jiang.
