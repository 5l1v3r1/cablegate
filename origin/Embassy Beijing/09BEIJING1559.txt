terrorist screening. Responses are keyed to lettered 
subheadings in ref A. 
 
¶2. (SBU) A: Immigration Databases and Traveler 
Information Collection: No updates to report.

readers at select international airport terminals to be 
used on arriving Chinese citizens.  As of yet, the system 
is not operational because of difficulties in 
standardizing the Chinese identification card.  The new 
system, once operational, will accept fingerprint 
identification.

Public Security (MPS) has advised us that there are seven 
countries (vice 18 reported previously) whose nationals 
may not have their temporary land transits into China 
recorded.  MPS refused to identify which countries are on 
this list except to say that they all border or are in 
close proximity to China and that Afghanistan is not 
among them.
