  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
"Holding to the principle of shared but differentiated 
responsibilities" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao)(12/17)(pg 4): "The root cause and the nature of climate 
change must be clarified before all the countries will reach 
consensus; developed countries should be accountable for the 
majority of greenhouse gas emissions.  What's more, the carbon 
emissions per capita of developing countries have been far less than 
that of developed countries, not to mention the fact that many 
industrial countries have contracted out carbon emissions to 
developing countries.  Ambassador Yu Qingtai, Chinese special envoy 
for climate change negotiation, has clearly stated China's stance: 
that China, due to the country's development of an economic society 
and the uplifting of many people's living standard, will not limit 
the Chinese people's rights to 1/3, 1/4 or even 1/5 of those of the 
developed countries' people.  To achieve our 2020 goal of reducing 
carbon emissions by 45 percent per GDP compared to 2005, China needs 
to invest USD$30 billion every year for the next ten years, which 
means that each Chinese household would need to contribute USD$64. 
The Chinese people would have to practice thrift savings at home in 
order to make this happen." 
 
¶2. TAIWAN 
 
"Impulse behind the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(12/17)(pg 10): "It 
is rumored that the United States will sell arms to Taiwan.  There 
are always multiple forces behind the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. 
The huge military industry complex in the U.S. consisting of the 
military, arms dealers and congressmen has formed a super interest 
group that has almost 'kidnapped' the military policies of the U.S. 
This includes arms sales to Taiwan.  At the same time, there are 
always groups of Hawks in U.S. foreign departments, their Congress 
or their think tanks who consider China's rise as a threat and 
continue to implement a containment policy against China.  Taiwan is 
still the U.S.'s best pawn used to contain China.  Therefore, 
selling arms to Taiwan meets the U.S.'s strategic needs.  However, 
the impulse to sell arms to Taiwan is not their real strategy. 
Whether the United States intends to sell arms or is just making 
noise will depend on the result of these complex political games." 
 
¶3. NORTH KOREA 
 
"South Korean media says North Korea will temporarily shut its doors 
to foreigners" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/17)(pg 2): "In regard to the news that 
North Korea will forbid foreigners from entering the country, media 
speculates that North Korea is trying to manage the possible 
internal chaos caused by its currency reform measures and to prevent 
the expansion of the A/H1N1 flu.  Experts said that these are North 
Korea's regular year end measures and should not be worrisome.  The 
South Korean government is cautious concerning the news.  A South 
Korean official said that North Korea issued invitations to several 
non-official South Korean groups who will be visiting North Korea 
after December 20th.  It requires further observation whether or not 
North Korea will actually restrict foreigners from entering the 
country.  The South Korean military also considered the news an 
indication of a dramatic change in North Korea.  However, there 
haven't yet been any unusual moves by the North Korean military. 
Global Times reporters have also observed that even though North 
Korea is undergoing a currency reformation, no internal chaos has 
occurred.  Many supermarkets and stores were in normal operations. 
What's more, there were not too many A/H1N1 patients.  It is 
peaceful in Pyongyang and there has been no panic."
