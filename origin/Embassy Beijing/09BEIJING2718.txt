¶1.  U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM 
 
"Obama's new policy receives unprecedented criticism" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/22)(pg 1): "Obama's plan to reduce the 
U.S. nuclear arsenal will surprise the world even more than his 
decision to withdraw the plan for a missile defense system [in 
Eastern Europe].  Although Obama's move has irritated conservatives 
in the U.S., Chinese experts argued that he will be able to 
implement his new policy despite conservatives' pressure.  Niu 
Xinchun, an international politics scholar, said the withdrawal of 
the missile defense system shows that Obama is promoting a 
neo-liberalist foreign policy, which is based on the idea that 'If I 
treat you well, you will treat me well,' rather than the foreign 
policy of the Bush administration, which was based on the idea that 
'If I am stronger than you, you must treat me well.'  Professor Han 
Xudong argued, however, that giving up the missile defense system 
has weakened the U.S.'s leadership.  Allies of the United States 
will feel like they are being fooled and will be less willing to 
fight for the U.S.  Obama may also change the U.S. strategy of 
hedging its bets with regards to China, because he believes, 'If you 
think China is an enemy, then China may really become an enemy.' 
Obama's presidency may present an opportunity for U.S.-China 
relations, one that China should grasp to develop friendship with, 
not hostility towards, the U.S." 
 
"U.S. missile defense plan changed; China should be wary" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(pg 3): "Dai Xu, a renowned military expert, said 
pressure from Europe may have eased tensions between the U.S. and 
Russia.  Major General Wang Haiyun, an expert in international 
strategy, argued that the fact that the U.S. abandoned plans [for a 
missile defense system in Eastern Europe] shows that the U.S. wanted 
to ease European concerns and improve its relationship with Russia. 
This was not a sudden decision by the U.S. government.  Deploying a 
missile defense system in Eastern Europe is not the optimal solution 
from a technical standpoint.  Cost savings and resource optimization 
also influenced the decision.  Song Xiaojun, a military expert, said 
that the U.S. move may signal a strategic shift towards the 
Asia-Pacific region.  Dai Xu added that China will face increased 
pressure from the U.S. due to the improvement in U.S.-Russia 
relations.  China should be particularly wary of greater U.S. 
economic pressure.  The U.S. has not stopped its efforts to set up a 
missile defense system in the Asia-Pacific region, which is 
obviously targeted against China." 
 
¶2.  AFGHANISTAN 
 
"U.S. will lose in Afghanistan if it does not send more troops" 
 
The official popular newspaper Beijing Youth Daily (Beijing 
Qingnianbao)(09/22)(pg B4): "In a recent assessment report, the top 
U.S. military commander in Afghanistan said that the U.S. needs to 
increase the number of troops in Afghanistan or it will lose the 
war.  The report argued that the U.S. also needs to adopt a new 
strategy.  Foreign troops have failed to protect the lives of 
civilians, which makes them occupation troops.  The new strategy's 
primary goal should be winning the support of the Afghan people, not 
launching attacks on armed forces.  Experts argue that this 
assessment has presented Obama with a difficult challenge since most 
Americans oppose the war in Afghanistan.  Obama is cautious about 
sending more troops, but some Republican Congressmen have urged him 
to make a decision quickly or risk a further deterioration of the 
situation in Afghanistan."
