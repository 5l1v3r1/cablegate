  Editorial Quotes

¶1. CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
"The Copenhagen Conference did not fail" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(12/22)(pg 2): 
"The principles of a 'dual climate change responsibilities' have 
been maintained and the terms related to assistance and morality 
have not been deleted.  If you compare the Copenhagen Summit with 
the 'Kyoto Protocol', you will find the Copenhagen Summit, both in 
the breadth, depth and continuity, is better than the latter.  In 
breadth, before the Copenhagen Summit, China and the U.S., the 
world's two largest emitters, on November 20 signed a clean energy 
technology cooperation document, and on November 25 the United 
States, who boycotted the carbon emissions reduction suggestion, for 
the first time brought forward its reduction goals, a symbol of 
America's return to the world's 'carbon emissions reduction' camp. 
We have always seen the Copenhagen Conference as a global, flexible 
and sustainable procedure which should include backup 'anti-global 
warming' programs.  In fact, the Copenhagen Conference achieved this 
result.  If there are regrets, it is because the United States is 
entangled in the issue of 'the chicken or the egg,' and, rather than 
show good faith and sincerity, has linked the responsibility of 
emissions reduction to other countries." 
 
¶2. AFGHANISTAN 
 
"China should try sending police to Afghanistan" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/22)(pg 14): "As to the issue of whether or 
not China should send troops to Afghanistan, there is a middle road: 
instead of sending army, air force, missile troops or completely 
following the United States' steps, China could send police troops 
to Afghanistan in order to assist the Afghanistan government to 
ensure the security of engineering projects that China has helped 
with or has invested in.  The deteriorating Afghanistan situation is 
increasingly harming China's interests.  It is a reasonable choice 
for China to send police troops to assist the Afghan Government to 
ensure the safety of China's projects. It is also conducive to 
China's moral support for the Afghan government's efforts towards 
social stability.  This is the best time for China to take on its 
international duties and to promote China's national image." 
 
¶3. JAPAN 
 
"The U.S.- Japan relationship has become tense" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(12/22)(pg 
3): " Since Japan's Prime Minister Hatoyama took office this 
September, signs of tension have begun to show.  Recently, issues 
surrounding the Futenma airbase have made the future of the 
relations gloomy.  It seemed that the leaders of both Japan and the 
United States have encountered obstacles in their direct 
communication.  At the Copenhagen Summit, Hatoyama did not fulfill 
his wish of explaining the delayed Futenma airbase issue resolution 
while face to face with President Obama.  Meanwhile, a poll revealed 
that the two countries' people both became less optimistic about the 
relationship.  The United States is pressuring the Hatoyama 
government to make a decision as soon as possible.  Until this issue 
is resolved, the United States will continue to doubt the Hatoyama 
government."

"Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement: a key step for both sides 
of the Taiwan Strait" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(12/22)(pg6): 
"Chen Yunlin, Chairman of the Association for Relations across the 
Taiwan Straits has met with the Chairman of the Taiwan's Straits 
Exchange Foundation to promote negotiations on the Economic 
Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA).  The cross-Strait Economic 
Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) is to establish a 
negotiations model by the Taiwan authorities with the Mainland in 
accordance with that of China-ASEAN FTA .  A mainland scholar 
pointed out that ECFA is only a regional matter, which will only 
have a partial rather than overall impact on the mainland.  However, 
the ECFA to Taiwan, is a holistic, strategic and comprehensive 
matter, which will determine the future of Taiwan.  Therefore, there 
is no doubt that Taiwan needs the ECFA more than the mainland does. 
Meanwhile, the Mainland's focus on the ECFA has more significance 
than just economic interests.  In light of pursuing the peaceful

development of cross-Strait relations, the ECFA's main goal is 
systemizing cross-Strait economic relations.  The economic merging 
across the Strait will be effective in preventing Taiwan 
independence forces from expanding its influence and promoting the 
consideration of political integration.  The ECFA is a key step for 
cross-Strait integration momentum from economic to political 
fields."
