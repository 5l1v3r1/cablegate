Human Rights 
------------ 
¶2. China "attaches great importance" to the UN Human Rights Council 
(UNHRC) upcoming review of China's human rights record, said 
spokesperson Jiang Yu at the February 5 regularly scheduled MFA 
press conference. Jiang noted that China has submitted its human 
rights report to the UNHRC and expects a constructive dialogue 
during the review process.  She said China respects and protects 
human rights and has achieved "remarkable progress" in improving 
human rights in China.  Jiang expressed hope that the UNHRC will 
"objectively" look at China's human rights record, noting that it is 
normal for countries to have different views on human rights and 
that these differences should be resolved through dialogue. 
 
Iran 
---- 
¶3. Responding to a question about Iran, Jiang said Assistant Foreign 
Minister Liu Jieyi met with other P5-plus-1 Political Directors in 
Germany February 4 to discuss the Iranian nuclear issue.  Jiang 
noted AFM Liu's comments that the six countries should "stick to 
diplomatic negotiations," expand diplomatic efforts and show 
"creativity" in seeking a long-term, appropriate settlement to the 
issue. 
 
DPRK 
---- 
¶4.  Responding to a journalist's comment that China has remained 
silent in the face of North Korea's recent provocations, Jiang said 
China has consistently made efforts to promote reconciliation and 
dialogue on the Korean Peninsula.  She noted that China's aid to the 
DPRK is aimed at helping the people overcome economic difficulties, 
adding that maintaining stability is in the interest of the entire 
Korean Peninsula. 
 
Guantanamo Uighurs 
------------------ 
¶5.  In response to a question about media reports that the Canadian 
Government is considering accepting some of the Uighur detainees 
held at Guantanamo Bay, Jiang said China opposes any country 
accepting the ethnic Uighur PRC-citizen detainees.  She expressed 
hope that "relevant parties" will follow international law and 
"properly handle" this issue. 
 
Bali Roadmap 
------------ 
¶6.  Regarding the Bali Roadmap for a future international agreement 
on climate change, Jiang said China has made great efforts to reduce 
emissions and has integrated environmental protection plans into 
national plans for economic development.  Noting that progress on 
implementation of the Bali Roadmap has been "sluggish," she said the 
international community should work together to fully implement the 
Roadmap.  Jiang said developed countries should take the lead in 
efforts to reduce emissions, adding that developing countries can 
make a great contribution if developed countries "abide by their 
commitments" and transfer necessary technology to developing 
countries.  Although China's per capita emissions are "relatively 
small," China is willing to work with other countries on climate 
change, Jiang stated.
