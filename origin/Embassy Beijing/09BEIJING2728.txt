¶1.  G20 SUMMIT 
 
"U.S. and UK propose 'global economic rebalancing'" 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(09/23)(pg A4): "With the G20 summit in 
Pittsburgh drawing nearer, G20 countries are accelerating efforts to 
lay out their respective positions.  So far, it seems that there is 
no support for an immediate end to economic stimulus measures, but 
the U.S. and UK initiative on global economic rebalancing may emerge 
as a hot topic.  The British Prime Minister has called for a new 
framework to be set up to solve the global economic imbalance. 
Obama also said that 'economic rebalancing' is one of topics that 
should be discussed at the summit.  [The U.S. position is that] 
given its large trade deficit with China and Germany, the U.S. 
should increase exports.  South Korean President Lee Myung Bak said 
that South Korea may host the next G20 summit.  He also emphasized 
the importance of 'balanced development' and the fact that one 
country's issues will inevitably affect other countries." 
 
"Harmonious Sino-U.S. relations helpful to 'a world in harmony'" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(09/23)(pg 3): 
"The U.S.-China summit in New York will not only discuss bilateral 
issues, but also focus on global issues.  When talking about the 
G20, Jon Huntsman, the newly-appointed U.S. Ambassador to China, 
said that the U.S.-China relationship will soon reach its highest 
point in 30 years and the focus will shift more and more from 
solving bilateral issues to solving global issues.  Gong Li, Deputy 
Director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies at 
China's Central Party School, said that although some U.S. scholars 
have recently proposed the idea of a 'G2,' China wants to be 
peaceful and never take the lead, which is why it does not recognize 
the idea of a G2.  He argued that the world should not be dominated 
by only one superpower or even two superpowers together, but noted 
that this will not prevent China from continuing to cooperate with 
the U.S.  China also hopes the G20 summit can resist protectionism. 
The assistant to the president of the People's Bank of China, Guo 
Qingping, said that China will implement the agreements reached at 
the G20 summit in London, including financial supervision, 
international cooperation, and international financial supervision 
reform." 
 
¶2.  CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
"China suddenly called 'climate leader'" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/23)(pg 1): "It is surprising for China 
that the West's criticisms over climate change have turned into an 
expectation that China will take the lead in dealing with this 
issue.  Chinese experts believe that China, as a developing country, 
is not yet capable of taking the lead on climate change nor should 
it have this obligation.  Some experts worry that this is actually a 
trap for China.  Zou Ji, Deputy Director of the School of 
Environmental Studies at the People's University of China, argued 
that China has made contributions to emissions reduction and it is 
now time for the U.S. to reflect on its selfishness.  Developed 
countries should take more responsibility for today's climate change 
problems and should not let developing countries pay for developed 
countries' past mistakes.  Developed countries should provide 
technical and monetary support to help developing countries reduce 
emissions.  At heart, [climate change] negotiations are a fight 
between developed and developing countries."
