China AFM to Join Solana in Delivering Iran Letter 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2. At the June 12, 2008 regular MFA press briefing, MFA Spokesman 
Qin Gang announced that AFM Liu Jieyi will join EU foreign policy 
chief Javier Solana and foreign ministry representatives from 
Russia, France, Germany and the UK on June 14 in delivering a "talk 
resumption plan" to Iran.  Qin stated China's hope that the relevant 
parties can find a "proper solution in a comprehensive and long-term 
way." 
 
China Opposes Selling Arms to Taiwan 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. The Chinese Government firmly opposes U.S.  weapons sales to 
Taiwan and U.S.  military relations with Taiwan, said the spokesman. 
 China requests that the United States honor the commitments made in 
the three Joint Communiques, particularly those made in the August 
17 Communique.  Qin added that the United States should "permanently 
stop," not just suspend, weapons sales to Taiwan, and should 
"thoroughly, not just partly," end such sales. 
 
United States Should "Not Be Paranoid" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. China has taken note of the "relevant reports," said Qin in 
response to a reporter's question on the alleged Chinese hacking 
into Congressional computers and plans to hack into those of 
visitors during the Olympics, and urges the United States to "not be 
paranoid."  The spokesman asserted that China is a "developing 
country," and asked if the reporter believes that China's science 
and technology is "so sophisticated that it even scares the United 
States."  Qin stated that the United States should do more to 
contribute to understanding and mutual trust between the two 
countries. 
 
Dalai Lama in Australia, Media in Tibet, Torch Relay 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶5. The Chinese Government firmly opposes any country providing 
support or convenience to the Dalai Lama, and calls on the 
Australian Government to not allow the Dalai Lama to engage in 
separatist activities in Australia territory.  Responding to a 
reporter's question, Qin said that the next round of talks with the 
Dalai Lama's representatives is still under discussion.  Asked about 
plans for the Olympic torch relay to pass through Tibet, Qin replied 
that because of the Wenchuan earthquake, the torch relay course had 
been "adjusted." 
 
¶6. Due to the "3-14" violence, Tibet is still not open to foreign 
journalists, Qin said in response to a reporter's question, and the 
responsibility for closure is "not on the shoulders" of the Chinese 
Government, but on those of the "Dalai Lama clique."  The spokesman 
expressed confidence in the continued restoration of social 
stability in Tibet, and told reporters China will give consideration 
to their "aspirations." 
 
China Hopes DPRK-Japan Talks Are Beneficial 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Qin had no specifics to offer regarding today's talks in Beijing 
between Japan and North Korea.  He voiced hope that the talks 
between the two sides would be beneficial and help to bring the 
Six-Party Talks to a "new stage." 
 
Pacific Islands Assistance, China and Environment 
--------------------------------------------- ----

¶8.  The spokesman delivered a lengthy defense of its "no strings 
attached," "friendly" financial assistance to Pacific Island 
nations, which does not "interfere in the internal affairs" of the 
countries involved, when asked by the People's Daily about a report 
released by an Australian think tank criticizing China's 
"increasing" amounts of spending in the Pacific Island region.  Qin 
called the report "totally pointless and unacceptable."  China takes 
many measures to promote sustainable development and the "harmonious 
development" of humans and nature, said Qin in defense against a 
World Wildlife Fund report which called attention to China's growing 
"ecological footprint," adding that China stands ready to contribute 
and cooperate with other countries on environmental issues. 
 
German FM visit 
---------------- 
 
¶9. Qin told reporters that German Vice Chancellor and Foreign 
Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier will meet with FM Yang Jiechi, PM 
Wen Jiabao and State Councilor Dai Bingguo during his June 13-15 
visit to China.  Asked if the Tibet issue would be discussed during 
FM Steinmeier's meetings, Qin stated that if the German side is 
interested in the Dalai Lama issue, China is ready to brief the 
foreign minister on the relevant issues and China's stance.
