¶1. RUSSIA-UKRAINE GAS DISPUTES 
 
a. "A prolonged delay is not beneficial and a compromise is hard to 
make" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) (01/07): 
"This is the third time that Russia has cut off the gas supply to 
Ukraine. This cut-off has had a smaller impact on Europe than the 
2006 cut-off. Since the two sides are both unprepared 
psychologically and in the aspect of supply, the difficulty in 
finding a resolution has greatly increased.  The direct reason for 
the gas cut-off is related to economics and geopolitical factors. At 
present, it is difficult for Russia and Ukraine to make a 
compromise. Thus, this time, the dispute will last for a while. The 
next step for both sides is relying on the EU's mediation to realize 
a bilateral compromise. The Russia-Ukraine relationship has been 
further worsened. Consequently, Russia will try to construct a 
pipeline detouring Ukraine to Europe and Europe will make an effort 
to get rid of reliance on Russian energy." 
 
b. "When will the Russia-Ukraine dispute end?" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) (01/07): 
"The reason for the current gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine 
is based on gas prices and transit fees. In this current conflict, 
one may notice that the strategy Russia is using to fight Ukraine 
has changed. By cutting off the gas supply to Ukraine, Russia has 
increased the supply of natural gas to Europe. The EU has become the 
'hostage' in the Russia-Ukraine fight and is acting differently from 
¶2006.  It did not criticize Russia's move and has shown no 
willingness to interfere in the conflict.  The reasons for this are: 
the EU has sufficient reserves of natural gas, and because Russia 
did not show any intention of provoking the EU by cutting off gas 
supply to Ukraine and therefore the EU has no reason to criticize 
Russia, and both Russia and Ukraine have made efforts to gain the 
EU's support.  The EU is unwilling to offend either country.  The 
conflict between Russia and Ukraine may influence the structural 
makeup of natural gas exports from Russia. Russia may look for a new 
energy export route to gain more independence." 
 
¶2. CHINA'S DIPLOMACY 
 
"One should not ignore China's influence in the world" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/07): "There is a circulating opinion in 
China that 'now' is not the time for China to influence the world 
and therefore China should not consider influencing the world. 
China's influence, in fact, has come from three aspects: first, its 
economic prosperity; second, China's independent 'China factor'; and 
third, their unique development path. ...There is no need to discuss 
China's potential to influence the world. But there is a need to 
evaluate how much influence China has in the world and on what kinds 
of issues China is having an influence.  Only when the Chinese 
people understand China's influence in the world, can the Chinese 
people manage their country's influence appropriately."
