SUBJECT: PRC RESPONSE TO U.S. UNGA THIRD COMMITTEE 
PRIORITIES 
 
REF: STATE 109397 
 
¶1. (SBU) On October 23, PolOff delivered to MFA International 
Organizations and Conferences Department Human Rights Affairs 
Division Deputy Director Yao Shaojun reftel points on U.S. 
priorities for the upcoming session of the UN General 
Assembly (UNGA) Third Committee session (covering human 
rights-related issues).  Yao thanked PolOff for sharing U.S. 
concerns on Third Committee issues, which he said he would 
report to his superiors.  Yao shared his "preliminary 
reaction" on the U.S. priorities. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On no-action motions, Yao pointed out that in the 
Chinese view, such motions were a legal tool and were in the 
rules of procedure for the Third Committee.  Yao suggested 
that a fundamental means to stop the use of no-action motions 
would be to stop the "politicization" of human rights issues, 
both in the Third Committee and the Human Rights Council. 
 
¶3. (SBU) With regard to country-specific resolutions, Yao 
related that China believed the best way to resolve such 
human rights concerns was to have a "sincere dialogue" with 
those countries or offer "sincere help" to them.  Such 
"naming and shaming," both in history and in practice, did 
not lead to the desired results.  In general, China did not 
support country-specific resolutions, Yao added.  If there 
were a need for such a resolution, China hoped that there 
would be a broad consensus among the countries in the region 
surrounding the subject country. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On defamation, while China saw the U.S. point of 
view, it was a reality that this type of speech existed, Yao 
stated.  In response to the three suggested U.S. alternate 
means to combat negative stereotyping of religion (see reftel 
para 6), Yao said that the best way forward would be to find 
common ground by combining OIC country objectives and 
concerns with the U.S. point of view.  Yao urged the U.S. to 
have more dialogue with OIC countries on this issue. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Finally, Yao said he believed that China would have 
"no problem" with the U.S. biennial resolution on free 
elections and expressed hope that such a resolution would not 
contain any "political content."
