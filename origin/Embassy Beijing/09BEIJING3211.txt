12th China-EU Summit 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. At the December 1 regularly scheduled Foreign Ministry press 
briefing, Spokesperson Qin Gang briefed on the 12th China-EU Summit 
hosted by President Hu Jintao in Nanjing on November 30.  President 
Hu, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, and Swedish 
Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt who represented the EU presidency, 
reported progress in China-EU relations.  Qin noted that the summit 
focused on "comprehensive strategic relations" between the PRC and 
the EU, including climate change, Renminbi exchange issues, 
sustainable development, and joint responses to the financial 
crisis.  Qin said the summit illustrated that the largest developing 
country and the largest community of developed countries should 
collaborate in addressing global challenges due to "transformational 
changes" in the international landscape. 
 
Climate Change and Copenhagen 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3. Turning to climate change issues, Qin listed China's goals for 
the success of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen: 
adherence to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCC), Kyoto Protocol, and the Bali roadmap.  Specifically, 
the UNFCC principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" 
should be observed in order to reach consensus.  Qin refuted reports 
that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had organized a meeting 
among developing countries in advance of the Copenhagen Conference. 
Qin noted the dates of Premier Wen Jiabao's attendance of the 
Copenhagen Conference were not confirmed. 
 
¶4. Developed countries caused climate change problems and 80 percent 
of carbon accumulation was caused by these developed countries, said 
Qin.  As a developing country, China was ready to work together with 
developed countries to address climate change issues.  Qin noted 
that developed countries should establish a reduction plan including 
financial support and technology transfers to developing countries 
for sustainable development. 
 
Sanctions on Iran "Not the Goal" 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5. Commenting on Chinese support for the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) resolution critical of Iran's nuclear program, Qin 
said China supported resolving the issue of Iran's uranium 
enrichment program through dialogue and negotiations.  He noted that 
sanctions on Iran were "not the goal" and that all sides should 
increase diplomatic efforts to resume talks. 
 
Taiwan Representative Office in Japan 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. When asked about Taiwan's opening of a representative office in 
Sapporo, Japan, Qin stated that the PRC did not object to third 
countries developing civil and economic ties with Taiwan as long as 
they did not develop official relations that would violate the "one 
China principle." 
 
Supporting U.S.-DPRK Dialogue 
----------------------------- 
 
¶7. Qin expressed support for dialogue between the DPRK and the 
United States in of the context of reports of the December 8 visit 
to the DPRK by Special Representative for North Korea Policy Stephen 
Bosworth.  The PRC viewed the visit as within the Six-Party Talks 
framework and conducive to the resumption of the Six-Party Talks, 
said Qin. 
 
DPRK Currency Revaluation 
-------------------------

¶8. Qin remarked that currency policies were an "internal affair" 
when commenting on the Democratic Republic of Korea's (DPRK) 
currency reevaluation.   As a "friendly neighbor," China had no 
comment on this issue would continue economic ties with the DPRK.
