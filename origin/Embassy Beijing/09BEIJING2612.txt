¶1.  9/11 ANNIVERSARY 
 
"9/11 incident still bothers U.S." 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/11)(pg 7): "Chinese scholar Geng Xin said 
that the U.S. initially had the support and sympathy of the world 
after 9/11, but after launching two 'unbalanced wars' the U.S. has 
tarnished its international reputation and is on a path that seems 
without end.  The U.S. should learn a lesson from the two things it 
has done to negatively impact the world: the War on Terrorism and 
the financial crisis.  Since Obama took office, he has tried to 
discard Bush's political heritage by downplaying the concept of a 
'War on Terrorism.'  However, Obama is still facing difficulties in 
both Iraq and Afghanistan.  Zhou Shijian, a professor at the 
American Studies Center at Qinghua University, argued that the 
reason the War on Terrorism has led to more terrorist attacks is 
because the U.S.'s 'hegemonic measures' cannot eliminate the root 
cause of terrorism: extreme poverty.  Shi Yinghong, Director of the 
American Studies Center at People's University of China, said that 
the War on Terrorism has presented Americans with a complicated 
reality.  Although Obama is determined to change the policies of the 
Bush era, he is still unable to completely cut and run.  The 9/11 
[terrorist attacks] will continue to bother the U.S., not only in 
the way the War on Terrorism will continue to impact the U.S., but 
also in the war's increasingly negative influence on the world." 
 
¶2.  U.S.-CHINA MILIARY RELATIONS 
 
"U.S. Navy Major General says China's anti-aircraft carrier missiles 
for defense only" 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated with the 
official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (09/11)(pg 7): 
"Aircraft carriers have always been symbols of U.S. hegemony on the 
high seas.  People often question, however, the real combat value of 
aircraft carriers given the enormous costs of building and operating 
them, and the large target they present.  A U.S. Navy Major General 
wrote an article titled 'Aircraft Carriers: the Navy, Air Force, and 
Complex Combat,' in which he defended the aircraft carrier's 
critical role in modern naval warfare.  The rapid rise of China's 
Navy has become a major focus of U.S. military attention.  According 
to the Major General's article, the number of vessels in the Chinese 
Navy will exceed the number in the U.S. Navy in the next 10 years. 
The Chinese Navy's transportation capabilities and its influence on 
East Asian energy security cannot be ignored.  The U.S. Navy should 
be ready to cooperate with the Chinese and Indian navies in the 
future.  The 'fever' that many countries have to build aircraft 
carriers proves that the theory that aircraft carriers are useless 
is wrong.  The importance of aircraft carriers for U.S. Navy combat 
operations is incomparable." 
 
¶3.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 
 
"Intellectual property rights should protect public interests" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/10)(pg 14): "Competition over intellectual 
property rights in international trade has intensified.  In recent 
years, over-protection of intellectual property rights has 
frequently contradicted China's public interests, such as the 'blank 
screen' incident that occurred with (pirated) Microsoft software 
installed on computers in China last October (an anti-piracy effort 
by Microsoft).  China should also be alert to foreign transnational 
companies' attempts to monopolize gene patents in order to control 
developing countries' sovereignty over food resources.  There are 
questions over which is more important: protecting the interests of 
the owners of intellectual property rights, or protecting and 
improving the interests of society as a whole?  Western countries 
have put more emphasis on protecting private IPR, but ignore public 
interests.  However, protecting and promoting public interests 
should be the ultimate goal of IPR protection."
