  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  NORTH KOREA 
 
"Clinton visits Pyongyang to bring back journalists" 
 
The official Xinhua Daily Telegraph (Xinhua Meiri Dianxun) 
(08/05): "Although the United States' position on U.S.-North Korea 
bilateral talks has not changed and the U.S. government is still 
insisting that former U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to 
Pyongyang was in a private capacity and had nothing to do with the 
North Korean nuclear issue, it is undeniable that as the former 
President and husband of the present Secretary of State, Bill 
Clinton's 'private status' is special and met the expectations of 
the North Koreans (in terms of who they would be willing to discuss 
these issues with).  Although the U.S. has emphasized that the 
release of the journalists is a strictly humanitarian issue and has 
nothing to do with the North Korean nuclear issue, Clinton's sudden 
visit to North Korea at a time when the Six Party Talks are at an 
impasse no doubt has important symbolic and practical implications." 
 
 
¶2.  U.S. ARMS DEVELOPMENT 
 
"It is inhuman for the U.S. to develop Massive Ordinance Penetrators 
(MOPs)" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (08/05): "Since the beginning of the 
thermonuclear age, nuclear weapons have been regarded as a strategic 
deterrent force.  Nuclear weapons cannot be used by any country due 
to their political significance.  Thus, the tendency of the U.S. 
military has been to focus on developing conventional weapons.  This 
'sword dance' by the U.S. is clearly aimed at North Korea and Iran. 
This is the usual practice of the United States.  The U.S. has 
always used strength rather than words to deter other countries. 
The research and development of this weapon is not for its actual 
use, rather it is intended to strengthen the U.S. negotiating 
position vis-`-vis North Korea.  This weapon is very brutal and 
inhumane.  The U.S. is not very concerned about actually using such 
weapons.  Sometimes the U.S. even intentionally conducts 'accidental 
killings'; for example, the 'mistaken bombing' of the Chinese 
Embassy in the former Yugoslavia.  These intentional actions are 
against humanity and should give rise to more vigilance around the 
world.  The U.S. is using the money it gains from selling Treasury 
bonds to countries like China to develop this inhumane weapon.  This 
is very irresponsible." 
 
¶3.  U.S. PROTECTION OF TIRE INDUSTRY 
 
"Special protections for tire industry cause friction in Sino-U.S. 
relations" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (08/05): "The first time the Obama 
Administration has investigated a trade case with China is related 
to the special protections for the U.S. tire industry initiated by 
the U.S. Congress.  This case has caused the greatest friction in 
Sino-U.S. relations since Obama took office.  Such actions by the 
U.S. will easily trigger trade protectionism.  Chinese tires 
exported to the U.S. do not pose a direct threat to U.S. tire 
manufacturers since Chinese tires are mainly sold in low-end markets 
whereas U.S.-manufactured tires are supplied to U.S. automobile 
manufacturers.  Thus, Chinese tires will not substantially hurt the 
production of U.S. tires.  Congressional politics in the United 
States is all about votes.  Congressmen are only concerned about the 
interests of their local electorate, and do not care too much about 
their country's overall interests.  Therefore, it is not surprising 
for them to do something that negatively affects Sino-U.S. trade 
relations."
