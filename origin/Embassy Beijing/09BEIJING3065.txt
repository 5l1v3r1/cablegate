NEW SCREENING PROCEDURES FOR POSSIBLE H1N1 INFLUENZA 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
¶4. (U) Effective May 11, 2009, Chinese Health and Quarantine 
(H&Q) authorities has implemented the following new 
procedures to screen for the possibility of influenza among 
passengers on flights arriving from the U.S.  Although the 
Chinese authorities have informed the Embassy that these 
procedures will not be applied to incoming official 
delegations, Embassy requests that the members of the 
delegation be aware that these procedures could be 
implemented at any time should the situation change 
significantly while the delegation is in China. 
 
(A)  All passengers are required to complete the H&Q health 
form (or "Quarantine Card") prior to disembarkation.  The air 
carrier will provide passengers with the necessary paperwork 
prior to landing in China. 
 
(B)  Chinese officials no longer board the plane to take 
temperatures, but all passengers are required to pass through 
a temperature detector device in the terminal. 
 
(C)  Should a passenger be found suffering from fever, the 
following procedures will be followed: 
 
¶1. One case of fever on board the flight: 
   a) All  passengers seated 3 rows before and after the 
individual will be required to remain on board for additional 
testing and evaluation by H&Q. 
   b) Upon completion of H&Q's assessment, these passengers 
will either be released or placed in quarantine. 
   c) All other passengers will be released upon completion 
of a H&Q health form. 
 
¶2.  Two or more cases of fever on board the flight: 
    a) All passengers are required to remain on board until 
further notice. 
    b)All passengers will be relocated to designated areas 
for further evaluation (e.g.in Beijing, Terminal 3: Concourse 
D). 
    c)  Upon completion of H&Q's assessment of the situation, 
passengers will either be released or placed in quarantine. 
 
(D)  H&Q previously stated that next steps after evaluation 
may include simply completing a "Quarantine Card," undergoing 
a routine medical exam at the airport, or, in some 
circumstances, transportation to local hospitals and/or 
hotels designated for quarantine. 
 
(E)  H&Q has also stated it will implement different 
procedures for specific passengers with H1N1 influenza 
symptoms, which may include:  1) observation in a designated 
hospital (e.g., in Beijing: Ditan Hospital and/or 2) 
quarantine (e.g., in Beijing: Guoman Hotel or Jinglin Hotel). 
 The official quarantine period is up to seven days. 
 
H&Q currently provides NO special courtesies or waivers to 
individuals holding official or diplomatic passports.

Security and Threat Assessment 
------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) The threat level for all China posts is considered low 
for crime and medium for terrorism. 
 
¶6. (U) The Regional Security Office is not aware of any 
specific threat directed against any U.S. person or traveling 
delegation.  Should such information be developed, the 
Chinese security services are committed to advise the Embassy 
of pertinent information and to provide necessary security 
coverage. 
 
¶7. (U) China experiences a moderate rate of crime, including 
recent incidents ranging from petty theft to murder. 
Pickpockets are particularly active in crowded markets, and 
foreigners are often sought out as primary targets.  Petty 
theft from hotel rooms is uncommon, but visitors are advised 
not to leave valuables lying loose or unattended in their 
rooms. 
 
¶8. (U) Visitors are reminded to take necessary precautions in 
safeguarding sensitive material and information.  All non-USG 
facilities must be considered technically compromised and may 
not be used to discuss, process, or store classified 
information.  Telephone calls, e-mail, and Internet usage are 
routinely monitored and hotel rooms searched. 
 
¶9. (U) Travelers should be aware that previous visitors have 
reported that their unattended computers have been subjected 
to tampering.  The efforts may be directed toward obtaining 
information on the computers, but problems ranging from 
viruses left on their systems to hard drives, that are no 
longer functional have been reported.  Hotels and private 
Chinese Internet providers have in some cases given hotel 
guests "free" thumb drives for use with their computers.  The 
source and quality of these devices are unknown.  Such 
devices could contain malicious codes and viruses and should 
not be used on government computers.  Official visitors are 
reminded that non-inspectable electrical/electronic 
equipment, i.e., cellular telephones, laptop computers, 
personal digital assistants (PDAs), etc., may not be brought 
into the controlled access areas of the Chancery.  If a 
visitor intends to travel with USG-owned computers and 
equipment for use within the Chancery, please contact the 
Regional Security Officer at 86-10-8531-4111, or 
GormanB2@state.gov or MooreBM@state.gov, for information and 
guidelines. 
 
¶10. (U) Passports and visas are required.  Americans 
arriving/transiting without valid passports and Chinese visas 
are not permitted to enter China and may also be subject to 
fines.   Those visitors traveling to China on a single-entry 
visa should be reminded that trips to Hong Kong or Macau 
Special Administrative Regions are treated as a visit outside 
Mainland China.  If the traveler is planning to return to 
Mainland China after a visit to one of these two destinations 
on the same single-entry visa, they will be denied entry. 
Visitors facing this situation will be required to apply for 
a new visa at the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office 
in Hong Kong to gain re-entry into Mainland China.
