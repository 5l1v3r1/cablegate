¶1. CHINA 
 
"Don't assume that the era of China has come" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (12/10): "China is relatively less affected 
by the financial crisis. The reason for this is not because China is 
more capable than other countries but because the financial system 
in China is far from open. Chinese people should have a calm mind 
that it is luck that saved China in this round of crisis. There are 
huge gaps in many fields of its financial system. These fields in 
the financial system are not in line with international standards. 
China's improvement only shows that China has gained more space 
within the scope of the existing rules and regulations established 
by the developed countries. China's impact on these rules is, 
currently, very limited. We have to realize that some developed 
countries that are showing strong interests in China or giving China 
much flattery may have their own hidden agendas." 
 
¶2. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 
 
"India and Russia push forward their strategic partnership" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(12/10): 
"The Russian President Dmitry Medvedev paid an official visit to 
India on Dec. 4th and 5th. He is the first foreign head of state to 
visit India after the Mumbai terrorist attacks. On Friday, India and 
Russia signed an agreement on civil nuclear cooperation as well as 
pacts covering the areas of defense, space, finance and tourism to 
elevate their strategic partnership to a higher level. These 
countries, traditionally, are allies. Both promote cooperation in 
the nuclear and military fields, especially when Russian energy 
exports are being hit by the current crisis. Russia has been a 
leading defense supplier to India and the quality of arms for India 
is always better than what it provided to other buyers, which 
demonstrates the unusual relations between the two. This trip is an 
extension of Putin's policy; which is 'great power diplomacy, 
geopolitical diplomacy and energy diplomacy'. A strong strategic 
partnership with India is one of the corner stones of Russia's Asia 
policy."
