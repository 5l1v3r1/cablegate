energy, the environment, balanced economic development and 
science and technology innovation.  Madame Wu hopes to 
increase Congress's understanding of China and point out the 
structural nature of current trade disptes.  To effectively 
solve problems, non-economic factors should be excluded from

trust and abolish the ban on high-tech exports.

More Tainted Chinese Exports in Latin America 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  Jiang had no details regarding reports of Chinese-made 
toothpaste in the Dominican Republic tainted with diethylene 
glycol.  She reiterated that China seeks to strengthen and 
improve regulations on quarantine and exports and enhance 
international cooperation and dialogue on such issues. 
 
Africa Cooperation: Dams and Aid to Sudan 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  Responding to a question about recent calls from foreign 
NGOs for China to reassess its policies in Africa that noted 
the environmental impact of a dam being built in Sudan, Jiang 
maintained that issues between the people and government of 
African nations are to be addressed internally by those 
nations themselves.  In a lengthy description of 
China-African cooperation, she said the dam project in Sudan 
is not being undertaken by the Chinese Government, but rather 
by a Chinese enterprise that won a contract through 
international bidding.  Such projects consider the 
environmental effect on local communities and will benefit 
the long-term livelihood of African people, said Jiang, 
adding that China requires enterprises to strictly abide by 
relevant laws and regulations in African nations.  She 
reiterated that financial assistance to Africa is modest, 
comes with no political strings attached and is tailored to 
the development needs of these nations. 
 
HK Legal Reform Will Develop Gradually 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  British FM Beckett met with Premier Wen and FM Yang 
during her visit to China, promoting high level exchange and 
strategic dialogue while developing the two countries' 
strategic partnership, replied Jiang when asked about 
Beckett's comments on Hong Kong.  Over the past ten years 
China has implemented the "one country, two systems" policy 
allowing Hong Kong self-government.  Legal reform in the 
region will develop gradually to maintain the prosperity and 
stability of Hong Kong, said the spokeswoman. 
 
China-Peru Free Trade Agreement? 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  China has conducted extensive and friendly cooperation 
with Latin American countries, responded Jiang to a question 
on whether China and Peru were soon to begin negotiations on 
a free trade agreement.  Jiang referred specific questions on 
the issue to the Ministry of Commerce. 
 
Visits: Germany, Cape Verde, Thailand, FM Yang to ASEM 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶11.  German President Horst Koehler will visit May 23-26 to

Koehler will travel to Kunming on the 23rd, meet with 
President Hu, PM Wen and CPPCC Chairman Jia Qinglin on the 
24-25th in Beijing and then visit Shanghai.  The goals of the

issues, said Jiang.
