STATES MIGHT LIFT FINANCIAL "SANCTIONS" AGAINST NORTH KOREA, 
MFA SPOKESPERSON QIN GANG SAID RESUMPTION OF THE SIX-PARTY 
TALKS NEEDS THE EFFORTS OF ALL SIX PARTIES TO ELIMINATE 
CURRENT OBSTACLES AND TO CREATE MUTUAL TRUST.  WHEN PRESSED, 
QIN SAID CHINA'S POSITION ON FINANCIAL CRIMES IS CLEAR: 
PROSECUTING SUCH CRIMES REQUIRES "STICKING TO THE FACTS AND

TO CONSIDER THE CONCERNS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND
