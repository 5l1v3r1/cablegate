exchanges to further strengthen ties. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) State Councilor Chen cited the importance of 
the bilateral relationship for China and stated that 
successful and ongoing top-level exchanges between the 
leaders of the two countries have laid the foundation 
for constructive, cooperative strategic bilateral 
relations for the 21st century.  China is working hard 
to prepare for hosting a top tier Olympic Games, 
including hosting more than 10,000 journalists.  In 
addition to the new regulations on foreign 
journalists, China is committed to providing 
journalists with excellent facilities and service, in 
keeping with its commitments and international 
standards.  China will try to show its achievements 
and spirit, but won't color its difficulties, State 
Councilor Chen said.  China remains a developing 
country, it is natural that it has some problems, and 
China hopes that foreign journalists will understand 
this. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Chen said China hoped to emulate successful 
U.S. efforts to popularize sport for all its citizens 
and agreed with U/S Hughes that continued educational 
exchanges between the two countries are very 
important.  The United States remains the number one 
destination for Chinese students, Chen noted, and 
China is happy to welcome more American students to 
study in China. 
 
SCIO's Cai on Media Freedoms 
---------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) U/S Hughes, accompanied by PD Envoy Kwan, 
complimented SCIO Director Cai Wu on the recently 
implemented rules that loosen restrictions on foreign 
journalists and urged China to extend them beyond the 
2008 Beijing Olympic Games.  U/S Hughes noted that 
increasing freedom of the press in China will help 
Americans and Chinese alike to better understand 
China's role in the world, including, for example, 
China's active partnership with the United States on 
difficult issues like nuclear programs in North Korea 
and Iran.  Pointing out that the United States and 
China share so many interests, like being the number 
one and number two energy users in the world, U/S 
Hughes stressed the need for increased transparency 
between the two governments, even in areas where we do 
not agree.  Commenting that she had just visited a 
Chinese school where students recited part of Martin 
Luther King's "I have a dream" speech, U/S Hughes 
emphasized that a free press can highlight social 
problems, such as those in Dr. King's speech, and 
bring about positive change. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Minister Cai responded that the revised 
media rules indicate a new open-mindedness in 
welcoming the world to China and have been smoothly 
implemented for the past twenty days.  Admitting that 
prior Chinese policies could be viewed as "regulating" 
foreign journalists, Cai argued the new view is to 
provide "good service" to journalists.  If the revised 
regulations promote better understanding of China and 
facilitate China's reform and stability, they could be 
extended beyond the expiration date of October 17, 
2008, said Minister Cai.  In fact, Beijing is 
currently putting on a conference with officials from 
various municipalities and provinces to discuss how to 
implement the revised rules, provide better service to 
journalists and ensure better cooperation with 
international media.  When pressed about the expiry of 
the relaxed rules in October 2008, Cai responded that 
if the revised rules promote understanding, encourage 
honest reporting and facilitate China's reform and 
stability, "why would we change them?" 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Chinese recognize that China is not perfect, 
said Cai, voicing his opinion that Chinese society is 
currently at a stage of more frequent internal 
conflict.  Shielding internal strife from foreign 
journalists will not make it go away, but Cai said he 
hoped journalists would not only report China's 
problems, but also China's unremitting efforts to 
solve them.  If reporting is objective and truthful, 
then China is not worried that foreign journalists 
will observe and report on social problems in China, 
according to Cai.  Cai complained about those who 
write negatively about China without having ever 
visited, citing in particular a BBC report alleging 
that Chinese government hospitals harvested organs
