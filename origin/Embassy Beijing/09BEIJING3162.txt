U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a.  "Creating a win-win-win situation for the United States, China 
and India" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/23)(pg 14): "It is unnecessary for the 
United States, China and India to have complicated trilateral 
relations.  All three countries should congratulate rather than 
create obstacles for each other.  During his visit, Obama stated 
repeatedly that the United States will not contain China.  China 
hopes the new China-U.S. relationship can be developed in a way that 
takes into account both countries' security concerns.  India should 
feel encouraged by stable China-U.S. relations, and China should be 
understanding of the Indian Prime Minister's visit to the United 
States, a visit that will further the basic interests of both 
countries.  A win-win-win situation for the United States, China and 
India can be realized if China insists on peaceful and joint 
development with other countries." 
 
b.  "U.S. strategy of 'hitching a ride' on China not realistic" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/23)(pg 15): "Since there has been no 
improvement in its unemployment situation, the United States has 
decided to try to 'hitch a ride' on China's economic recovery in 
order to pull its economy out of recession and save on the costs of 
recovery.  This was one of the major goals of the United States' 
recent policy towards China.  The United States has taken advantage 
of China's economic recovery and reduced its own costs by cutting 
off China's core interests.  However, the U.S. strategy in this 
regard is not realistic.  Even if China were willing to help the 
United States recover, it is unable to do so since the U.S. economy 
is four times the size of China's.  Furthermore, the root cause of 
the financial crisis is not the global economic imbalance, 
especially not the China-U.S. trade imbalance, as argued by the 
United States.  The most urgent task for the United States is to 
strengthen financial reforms, develop real economic organizations, 
and implement a responsible foreign economic policy.  Otherwise, 
hitching a ride on China could harm the interests of all countries 
and accelerate the fall of the United States." 
 
c.  "An indicator of China-U.S. bilateral strategic trust" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(11/23)(pg 2): "Media commentator Jiang Yueyin 
said that U.S. export controls on trade with China are an indicator 
of bilateral economic ties.  These export controls are part of some 
groups' plans to contain China.  To a certain extent, these controls 
are forcing U.S. companies to give up their market share in China to 
competitors.  At its core, such thinking reflects a desire to 
contain China.  Once the United States relaxes and even abandons its 
export controls, the bilateral trade imbalance can be improved."
