Korean Denuclearization 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. At the September 4 regular MFA press conference, spokesperson 
Jiang Yu said that she had "heard" that Assistant Secretary 
Christopher Hill will be coming to Beijing to discuss the North 
Korea issue but his schedule has not yet been finalized.  Jiang said 
that it is the "goal of all the parties to achieve the September 19 
Joint Statement." Regarding "current problems" all parties should 
"enhance cooperation" and "join hands to resolve problems" to press 
ahead with the Six-Party Talks process.  Asked to confirm reports 
that North Korea has begun reversing the dismantlement of its 
nuclear program, Jiang said that "there are reports about that" and 
that "relevant parties should overcome the difficulties through 
contact and discussions." 
 
Military Budget 
--------------- 
 
¶3. China has submitted its second report to the "UN Military 
Spending Transparency Program" since joining the program last year, 
according to Jiang.  The report covers 2007 and "includes data on 
the main uses" of the money spent on the military.  Jiang said that 
this makes the "data more complete (fengfu) than last year." The 
report shows that "China attaches great importance to military 
transparency and will work actively with the countries of the world 
to promote military mutual trust."  Asked whether China would 
release any of the data to the press, Jiang said that the UN might 
release some data in accordance with its rules. 
 
Georgia-Russia Conflict 
----------------------- 
 
¶4.  China hopes that relevant parties in the conflict between Russia 
and Georgia will resolve their issues through dialogue and 
consultations, said Jiang. China also "hopes that the international 
community can play a positive role in resolving the conflict through 
dialogue."  Asked what the appropriate forum for dialogue would be, 
Jiang said that "a UN measure should help to promote a resolution 
and achieve peace and stability." 
 
China-Iraq Oil Deal 
------------------- 
 
¶5.  Jiang said that she had "read reports" that Iraq and Chinese 
enterprises were discussing an oil deal.  The Chinese government 
"supports the Chinese enterprises on the basis of equality and 
mutual benefit."  Jiang could not confirm whether a deal had been 
reached. 
 
Iranian President to Beijing 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Asked again to confirm reports that Iranian President Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad will arrive in Beijing on September 6 and that he will 
meet with Hu Jintao, Jiang said that China "welcomes foreign 
political figures" and that she will release relevant information in 
due course. Jiang added that Chinese leaders will also meet with 
foreign leaders who visit Beijing. 
 
North Korean Refugees 
---------------------

¶7.  Asked to comment on a report that large numbers of North Korean 
refugee children are living in China's border regions and are 
reduced to prostitution and mendicancy, Jiang referred reporters to 
"relevant authorities."  Jiang said that "illegal entry into China 
violates China's laws" adding that some illegal refugees have 
engaged in other "law breaking activities." China always handles 
this issue within international law and with the spirit of 
humanitarianism, said Jiang. 
 
Sichuan Earthquake 
------------------ 
 
¶8.  There have been no reports of casualties among foreigners 
resulting from the August 30 earthquake which struck the border 
between Sichuan and Yunnan said Jiang.  Jiang referred reporters to 
local authorities in response to a question regarding whether or not 
journalists can now visit the affected areas. 
 
Indonesian Timber Shipment 
-------------------------- 
 
¶9.  The spokesperson had not seen reports that Greenpeace activists 
had boarded an Indonesian ship carrying lumber bound for China. 
However, Jiang noted that China has "adopted effective measures 
against the illegal transport of timber."
