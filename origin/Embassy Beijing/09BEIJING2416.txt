SUBJECT: NOAA DAS DISCUSSES COOPERATION WITH CHINA'S CMA AND SOA 
 
REFTEL: 08 BEIJING 4250 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) Deputy Assistant Secretary, Dr. James Turner 
visited Beijing on August 13 to discuss areas of collaboration with 
the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and State Oceanic 
Administration (SOA).  CMA officials expressed appreciation for the 
long-standing cooperation with NOAA, noting that NOAA has been 
training most of CMA's senior staff since the late-1980s and many of 
CMA's key technological advancements are in part due to NOAA's 
assistance.  In his meeting with SOA, Dr. Turner repeatedly raised 
the issue of real-time data sharing from China's ocean monitoring 
satellite network, but SOA officials remained tight-lipped on the 
topic stating that this issue (REFTEL) would be discussed at the 
upcoming NOAA-SOA data panel meeting in early September in 
Washington DC. SOA officials also requested increased collaboration 
with NOAA on "Marine Functional Zoning (MFZ)" noting that 
coordination among China's different ministries and offices 
responsible for oceans management has been difficult. SOA's Dr. 
ZHANG Zhanhai also provided a brief overview of China's Arctic and 
Antarctic research stations. END SUMMARY. 
 
CMA CREDITS NOAA FOR CHINA'S IMPROVED STORM PREDICTION 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
¶2.  (SBU) CMA Deputy Administrator Dr. SHEN Xiaonong provided a 
brief overview of CMA, noting that his organization falls directly 
under the leadership of China's State Council and is essentially 
equivalent to a ministry.  CMA has 53,000 fixed staff, 40,000 
contractors, 2,400 staffed weather monitoring stations, 20,000 
unmanned remote monitoring stations, and 120 sounding devices that 
provide real-time data to CMA's data integration center in Beijing. 
CMA also operates China's Fengyun (FY) weather satellites. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Tropical storms Goni and Morakot resulted in eight deaths 
on the Chinese mainland and expected losses of 9.89 billion RMB, 
according to the Disaster Relief office of Ministry of Civil 
Affairs.  Dr. Shen said that the death toll due to the storms was 
relatively low, in part because of advanced warning systems that 
were the result of NOAA-CMA cooperation. Shen also said that NOAA 
had helped CMA acquire advanced technologies, including high-powered 
computers, space-rated semiconductors for weather satellites, and 
weather radars, resulting in key advancements in CMA's tropical 
cyclone tracking and prediction capabilities. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Shen was remarkably candid regarding the stove-piping that 
continues to hinder Chinese intra-governmental cooperation.  He said 
that coordination on major issues such as climate change is 
difficult since CMA "has no authority for anything below the sea 
surface." Despite the need for improved integrated ocean/atmosphere 
research, CMA itself sometimes has difficulty in obtaining 
ocean-related data from SOA. 
 
¶5.  (U) An official from CMA's National Meteorological Center (NMC) 
also provided Dr. Turner with a briefing on NMC's capabilities. 
[NOTE: NMC is roughly equivalent to the National Weather Service in 
the U.S. END NOTE.]  The official said that NMC operates a "decision 
making/policy assistance" office which has been crucial in helping 
Chinese leaders make informed decisions regarding weather-related 
disaster mitigation. These recommendations have resulted in far few 
deaths due to weather phenomena and more efficient emergency 
evacuations.  NMC also generates computer models that predict 
pollutant, toxic chemical, or radiological material dispersal.  NMC 
coordinates these efforts with other Chinese government 
organizations such as the Ministry of Environmental Protection, 
which would be responsible for responding to such an incident. 
 
SOA'S ROLE GROWS AS OCEAN ECONOMY EXPANDS RAPIDLY 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶6.  (U) On August 12, DAS Turner visited Qingdao to give a keynote 
address on the Ocean Economy at a forum sponsored by China's State 
Oceanic Administration (SOA).  The forum was well-attended and 
included several senior provincial leaders, including the governor 
of Shandong Province and mayor of Qingdao.  DAS Turner also visited 
Beijing on August 13 to discuss areas of collaboration with Dr. 
ZHANG Zhanhai, the Director General of the Department of 
International Cooperation at SOA.  Zhang stated that 40% of China's 
population lives on the coast, 60% of China's GDP comes from coastal 
 
BEIJING 00002416  002 OF 002 
 
 
areas, and another 10% is from the "marine economy" noting that this 
has doubled in just 5 years from 5% in 2003. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Zhang said that a SOA delegation will accompanying 
Minister of Science and Technology Wan Gang for the upcoming Joint 
Commission Meeting (JCM) on Science and Technology in Washington in 
October, although he did not indicate what specific proposals would 
be discussed at the JCM. Zhang also noted that he was looking 
forward to the NOAA-SOA Data Panel meeting in September.  DAS Turner 
used the opportunity to raise the issue of real-time satellite ocean 
data (and continued to raise it numerous times throughout the 
meeting) but Zhang was reluctant to discuss the issue, saying that 
this topic will be discussed at the data panel meeting. [COMMENT: 
SOA's response was consistent with previous NOAA and NASA efforts to 
obtain real-time satellite data from SOA.  SOA appears committed to 
not providing the data and it is unlikely that this position will 
change at the September Data Panel meeting. END COMMENT.] 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Zhang said that he hoped that SOA could work more closely 
with NOAA on "Marine Functional Zoning (MFZ)."  SOA said that 
coordinating issues such as aquaculture, ocean disaster mitigation, 
ocean pollution, and marine eco-preservation among different 
ministries and offices responsible for oceans management has been 
extremely challenging.  SOA was interested in learning more about 
NOAA's MFZ-equivalent "Ocean Spatial Planning" effort.  DAS Turner 
noted that NOAA had encountered similar difficulties in implementing 
the ocean spatial planning concept. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) During the SOA-hosted lunch, Zhang spoke at length about 
SOA's Arctic and Antarctic research facilities, since he had 
previously worked in the department that operated these sites.  He 
said that SOA operated two Arctic research centers and three 
Antarctic facilities, with one only become operational within the 
past two years, situated on the highest part of Antarctica at an 
altitude of 4300 meters.  Zhang said that the Antarctic research 
facility on Georgia Island would soon be receiving new satellite 
receiving equipment that would help SOA conduct climate change 
research [NOTE: SOA operates China's Haiyang ocean monitoring 
satellites and will probably be able to downlink real-time ocean 
data and images to their Antarctic station with this equipment.  END 
NOTE.]  Zhang also said that the high-altitude Antarctic facility 
will be receiving astronomical observation equipment since the 
atmosphere at this location is clear and dry.  Zhang did not suggest 
conducting joint Arctic/Antarctic research with NOAA but was clearly 
proud of China's research facilities at these sites.
