  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"Obama plays 'hurry scurry' with the Dalai Lama" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(10/08)(pg 3): 
"Obama does not want the Dalai Lama making trouble at a critical 
time when the U.S. needs China's support.  However, this does not 
mean that Obama will abandon the U.S. policy of 'using Tibet to 
contain China.'  The Obama administration needs China's 
understanding and support more than any previous U.S. administration 
on many issues, like the economic crisis, climate change, North 
Korea, Iran, and Afghanistan.  Zhang Liping at the China Academy of 
Social Sciences noted that if Obama met the Dalai Lama before his 
visit to China, it would be a very inopportune time and would 
destroy the atmosphere of the visit." 
 
"Why does the U.S. only praise China's last 30 years?" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(10/08)(pg 7): 
"Secretary Hillary Clinton congratulated China on its 60th 
anniversary by saying that China has made a historical achievement 
through its economic reforms of the last 30 years.  Why does the 
U.S. only congratulate China for the last 30 years?  In fact, 
history shows that the U.S. took the lead in imposing obstacles to 
the new China, causing enormous difficulties for the country's 
development and the survival of its people.  The congratulation for 
only the last 30 years shows that the U.S. cannot forget about 
fights over ideology or political systems.  The remarks are not 
proper for a big country like the U.S., which intentionally implied 
that it only recognizes China's economic development but does not 
support its political system.  Americans are biased in evaluating 
China's history, and they continue to broadcast this bias. 
Americans only see the last 30 years, rather than all 60 years of 
development and achievement in China, which gives them an inaccurate 
picture." 
 
¶2.  NORTH KOREA 
 
"U.S.-North Korea dialogue is an important step for the Six-Party 
Talks" 
 
The Beijing-based newspaper sponsored by official intellectual 
publication Guangming Daily and Guangdong Provincial official 
publication Nanfang Daily The Beijing News (Xin Jing Bao)(10/08)(pg 
A03): "The head of the Chinese delegation to the Six-Party Talks, Wu 
Dawei, said that the consensus Premier Wen Jiabao reached with Kim 
Jong Il demonstrates that this is an important opportunity - with 
all parties' joint efforts - to break the impasse in the Six-Party 
Talks.  China is supportive of bilateral dialogues within the 
framework of the Six-Party Talks.  North Korea's proposal to have a 
bilateral dialogue with the U.S. will make the resumption of the 
Six-Party Talks possible.  China is supportive of anything that will 
benefit the talks.  All parties concerned should adopt a positive 
attitude and grasp the opportunity to resume the talks as soon as 
possible.  China has faith in the future of the talks."
