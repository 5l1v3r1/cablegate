  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. U.S. 
 
"No breakthroughs on the DPRK/Iran nuclear issues can be achieved 
without the United States" 
 
The Beijing-based newspaper sponsored by official intellectual 
publication Guangming Daily and Guangdong Provincial official 
publication Nanfang Daily, The Beijing News (Xin Jing Bao)(01/03)(pg 
B09): "Although Iran's and the DPRK's stances are different, they 
are also the same, because both of them see the United States as 
their worst enemy and strike for equal say in their relations with 
the United States.  Zhang Bo, a renowned military expert, said that 
in 2010, the Iran nuclear issue would continue to stir tensions if 
there are no improvements in its relations with the West.  The 
Iranian government seems to get only tougher and tougher as it faces 
more and more sanctions.  Zhang also said that the DPRK changed its 
attitude after the U.S. Special Envoy's visit and that the DPRK 
nuclear issue will continue improving.  The DPRK's goal, according 
to Zhang, is to engage in direct talks with the United States and to 
eventually sign a peace agreement and even to establish formal 
diplomatic relations with the United States." 
 
¶2. U.S. - CHINA 
 
"Will China and the U.S. turn against each other in 2010?" 
 
The international news commercial publication of the People's Daily, 
Global Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/04)(pg 16):"Shi Yinhong, the 
Director of the School of International Relations at Renmin 
University, said that the United States will sell arms to Taiwan 
sooner or later and President Obama will almost for sure meet the 
Dalai Lama.  Obama just wants to choose the 'most appropriate' time 
and venue to do so with minimum negative impact.  Chinese President 
Hu Jintao will probably visit the United States in April and it is 
unlikely that the United States would do anything harmful to China's 
interests during that time.  Sun Zhe, a researcher from Tsinghua 
University argued that there is a 90-percent likelihood the arms 
sales to Taiwan, Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama and trade 
disputes will occur concurrently in the first quarter of this year. 
Tao Wenzhao, a professor at the Institute of American Studies at the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that in 2010 China and the 
United States will be faced with a number of negative factors and 
frictions, but we should not be too pessimistic since there are 
still many positive factors between the two countries.  Obama will 
be very cautious in dealing with sensitive issues involving China. 
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan should not include such a high-end weapon 
as the F-16 airplane.  Obama will certainly not meet the Dalai Lama 
in the same high-profile way as French President Sarkozy did." 
 
¶3. ECONOMIC 
 
"Sino-U.S. trade cloudy in 2009 and snowy in 2010" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper, 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(01/04)(pg 
1):"The United States has finally ruled on imposing 'countervailing' 
duties on China's OCTG (Oil Country Tubular Goods) products, which 
is by far the largest U. S trade sanction against China.  Whether or 
not the United States will impose 'anti-dumping' tariffs on China's 
OCTG products will be seen as an 'indicator' of the trade battle 
between China and the United States.  Normally, one year to one 
year-and-a-half after economic recession, trade protectionism across 
the world reaches its peak, which means we will see frequent trade 
frictions in 2010.  Chen Zhidong, an arbitrator for the China 
International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, said that 
many trade disputes originating from the United States are 
extensions of U.S. domestic politics.  Chen argued that facing a 10% 
plus unemployment rate, reducing import and increasing export tops 
any U.S. president's political agenda."
