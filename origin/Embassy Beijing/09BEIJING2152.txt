  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  S&ED 
 
"The U.S.'s hospitality to China surprised the world" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (07/28): "The opening of the S&ED that the 
U.S. held for China was like a 'millennium wedding' for the two 
countries.  However, Niu Xinchun, a researcher at the China 
Institute of Contemporary International Relations, argued that China 
should remain clear-minded.  Yes, the two countries can't live 
without each other but neither one is more dependent on the other. 
China needs to be cautious as the U.S. may 'seek practical gains 
through superficial etiquette.'  Qian Liwei, an expert at the same 
institute, said the S&ED is the first comprehensive engagement with 
China since Obama took office and its mission is to lay the 
framework for government-to-government communications; therefore, 
specific issues will not be discussed.  Wu Xinbo, Deputy Director at 
the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, argued that 
China is in an advantageous position this time and should raise its 
concerns and requests.  The U.S. may want to change China into the 
second Japan and we should see through this tactic." 
 
 
¶2.  U.S. BACK IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
 
"The U.S. is 'back' - what should China do?" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (07/28): "Although 
China's influence in Southeast Asia has already overpowered that of 
the United States, Southeast Asian nations still have deep concerns 
about China, and it is very difficult for China to eliminate these 
concerns.  The reason China can come to Southeast Asia is because it 
has abandoned ideology and put collaboration and economic 
development first.  However, many people in the region are worried 
about Southeast Asia's over-dependence on Chinese investment.  China 
needs to avoid thinking that money can resolve everything and, 
instead, put itself in the shoes of Southeast Asian nations.  China 
must recognize that there are more strategic risks than before and 
it will never be an 'easy stroll along.'" 
 
¶3.  CHINESE-RUSSIAN SECURITY COOPERATION 
 
"Defense security cooperation and building a harmonious world" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao) (07/28): "Peng Guangqian, Deputy Secretary-General of the 
China Committee for National Security Policy Studies, said one of 
the achievements of the recent joint Chinese-Russian military 
exercises was that the amount of time needed to prepare for the 
exercises was significantly reduced.  The purpose for China and 
Russia in holding the joint exercise was to consolidate and 
strengthen their bilateral strategic partnership as well as to fight 
terrorism, separatism, and extremism.  Both China and Russia are 
advocates of peace and no force can stop them from working together 
to preserve peace in the region and the world.  The biggest danger 
is not a lack of capacity to meet crises, but rather a lack of 
awareness about crises.  Combat operations can be avoided and this 
is the fundamental purpose of the military drill."
