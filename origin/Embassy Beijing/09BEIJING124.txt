  Editorial Quotes

¶1. CHINA DIPLOMACY 
 
a. "Don't always compare China's strengths with the shortcomings of 
others" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/15): "Recently, people have been comparing 
the 30 years since the 'opening up' with the 30 years before it. 
This process will lead to self satisfaction and arrogance. China 
needs to realize that while it is progressing, other countries are 
also moving forward. Although Europe, the U.S. and Japan have not 
grown as quickly as China, their growth is more balanced and 
comprehensive. China ranks very low in the human development index, 
HDI. China should compare its own shortcomings with the strengths of 
others. Once China begins to speak about averages, China will find 
itself in the company of developing countries below the fifty 
percent line.  China should focus on soft fields of a society, like 
citizenry, moral standards and courtesy, etc. In these fields, China 
still has a great distance to come in order to match the developed 
countries." 
 
b. "China can divide and conquer Europe" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(01/15): "The 
annual meeting of the World Economic Forum will take place in Davos 
Switzerland in January. China needs a new mentality when dealing 
with Europe. First, Europe is not monolithic. It has its own 
structural conflicts and interests which China may use to its 
advantage. Second, the U.S. - China relationship is mature and 
stable which bodes well for China. Third, England is friendly 
towards China. Thus, Europe needs China more than China needs Europe 
and China has the ability to balance against the Eastern Europeans 
radical values by adopting a similar attitude to the Western 
Europeans; realism. This strategy, to divide and conquer, is not a 
temporary approach. It should be the established model, a win-win 
for both China and Europe." 
 
¶2. MADE IN CHINA 
 
"'Made in China' shouldn't be something to be proud of" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/15): "People would like to believe that 
the more products are made in China, the more China will be able to 
participate in the global market. However, the term 'made in China' 
shows that China's manufacturing depends heavily on the orders and 
designs by American companies. 'Made in China' shows several facts: 
first, China provides cheap labor. Second, the U.S. economy has 
great control over the Chinese economy in some fields. Third, the 
true nature of 'made in China' is the processing of raw materials in 
China which does great harm to the environment and to people's 
health. Fourth, it shows that the U.S. has control over new science 
and technologies, new designs and new arts and crafts. However, 
China has made its own space technology and this is the kind of 
'made in China' that the country really needs."
