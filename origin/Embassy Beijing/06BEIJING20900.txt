China-Japan Relations 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. MFA Spokesperson Qin Gang stated that China 
attaches great importance to improving bilateral 
relations with Japan and is ready to "join hands" with 
Japan to this end.  When asked about a possible 
meeting between President Hu and Prime Minister Abe, 
Qin said that China's position on relations with Japan 
is "clear and consistent." 
 
China Opposes the Inclusion of Taiwan in the US-Japan 
Bilateral Alliance 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶3. When asked to comment on remarks reportedly made by 
a Japanese Defense Agency official, Qin stated that 
the PRC firmly opposes the inclusion of Taiwan into 
the US-Japan bilateral alliance, stating that it would 
be an intrusion into Chinese sovereignty and internal 
affairs.  The alliance, Qin said, should confine 
itself to bilateral issues so as to avoid adding 
"uneasiness and unstable factors to the region." 
 
Secretary Rice Visit to China 
 
SIPDIS 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. When asked if Secretary Rice will visit China in 
the near future, Qin said that China welcomes 
Secretary Rice to visit China at a "proper time" to 
 
SIPDIS 
exchange views on U.S.-China relations. 
 
Oil Cooperation with Iraq 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. Qin stated that China is prepared to resume and 
strengthen oil exploration cooperation with Iraq on 
the basis of "quality and mutual benefit."  He noted 
that Chinese oil cooperation is currently restricted 
to trade and personnel training, although Chinese 
companies had signed agreements with Iraq for oil 
exploration projects prior to the Iraq War.  Qin said 
that he had no information as to whether Iraq's Oil 
Minister planned to visit China. 
 
Wu Dawei to Visit the ROK 
------------------------- 
 
¶6. Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei will visit the ROK 
September 29 to October 1 to exchange views on the 
resumption of the Six-Party Talks and other issues of 
concern, Qin announced. 
 
Peacekeeping in Darfur 
---------------------- 
 
¶7. Peacekeeping missions in Darfur must have the 
consent of the Sudanese government, Qin said.  China

is ready to join the international community to 
promote the early realization of peace and stability 
in the Darfur region and China will continue to pay 
close attention to the situation in Sudan, Qin added. 
 
Increased Military Spending Not a Threat 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. Qin claimed that comments made by Japanese 
officials alleging that China's increased military 
spending threatens Japan is as an excuse meant to 
"hype up the Chinese threat."  China has a "friendly 
policy" toward its neighbors and its path of peaceful 
development threatens no country. 
 
Possible Koizumi Visit to Taiwan, Taiwan and the UN 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶9. When asked to comment on a possible visit to Taiwan 
by former Japanese PM Koizumi, Qin said that China 
hopes Japan will handle Taiwan issues within the One 
China Policy.  Commenting on Chen Shui-bian's reported 
remarks about Taiwan joining the UN, Qin reiterated 
that there is one China and Taiwan is part of China. 
 
Corruption Scandals and China's Image 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶10. Corruption in China is neither deep nor serious, 
Qin said, and most Chinese public servants are loyal 
to their country.  The recent corruption scandal in 
Shanghai will not impinge China's international image, 
he added. 
 
Human Organ Sales in China 
-------------------------- 
 
¶11. Responding to a question about human organ sales 
in China, Qin said such sales are prohibited in China. 
If the PRC receives information about human organ 
sales, public health officials will strictly deal with 
the matter in accordance with Chinese law.  He 
explained that, before the PRC will allow an executed 
prisoner's organs to be used, the prisoner must 
provide written consent, provincial health officials 
must approve and the hospital or entity using the 
organ must obtain approval from Chinese officials. 
 
China-ASEAN Summit 
------------------ 
 
¶12. A summit marking the 15th anniversary of China- 
ASEAN dialogue will take place in Nanning city in 
Guangxi Province on October 30.
