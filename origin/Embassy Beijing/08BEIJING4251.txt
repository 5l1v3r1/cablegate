¶1. CHINA'S THREAT 
 
"China has constructed an aircraft carrier; the story heats up" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/18): "Recently the director of the Foreign 
Affair's Office of China's Ministry of National Defense indicated 
that the World should not be surprised if China constructs an 
aircraft carrier. However, China will only use this type of military 
fleet vessel in naval defense. Some opinions indicate that once 
China possesses an aircraft carrier, the theory of the China threat 
will heat up again. Another Chinese expert indicates that it is 
unfair that the West is paying special attention to the possibility 
of China constructing an aircraft carrier. This move has aroused 
suspicions and worries about China's strategic intentions. A 
military officer believed that it is the strategic intention behind 
possessing the aircraft carrier that matters, not whether or not 
China has an aircraft carrier. In the future, if China has possessed 
an aircraft carrier, China will not use it to conduct regional 
deterrence, but only to promote regional peace and stability. The 
improvement of China's national strength can only bring more 
stability to the Asia-Pacific region." 
 
¶2. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
"Don't let conspiracy theories block the view" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/18): "China's economy has been impacted by 
the U.S. financial crisis since China has also bought some American 
bonds and because of the declining trade with developed countries. 
The U.S. should take the main responsibility for this. However, it 
doesn't mean that this crisis is a conspiracy conducted by the West 
against China. Such a mentality will influence China's judgment on 
many issues. If China continues to embrace the views of the last 
half a century when looking at the world, China will find it very 
difficult to grasp the right development trend in the world. The 
concept of a harmonious world represents the trend in modern 
development. China should stand taller and look farther into the 
future."
