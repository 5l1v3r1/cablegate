  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S.-JAPAN ALLIANCE 
 
"Where should U.S.-Japan alliance go?" 
 
The official Xinhua Daily Telegraph (Xinhua Meiri Dianxun)(01/13)(pg 
8): "Experts say that if an alliance is running well, there is no 
need to reiterate its importance.  However, U.S.-Japan relations 
have seen some friction over the Futenma base and the U.S.-Japan 
[secret (nuclear) deal issues.  Neither the U.S. nor Japan has 
mentioned weakening the alliance.  Japan has requested a decrease in 
its burden, while the U.S. hopes that it won't negatively influence 
its military strategy.  Such conflicts will go on, but there is 
little possibility that the alliance will undergo a major change. 
Japan's long-term goal is to be a normal country.  However, at 
present, the biggest obstacle is the U.S.  The recent contradictions 
between the two are in fact the Hatoyama cabinet's tentative 
measures toward the U.S.  If the U.S.-Japan alliance undergoes any 
changes, the U.S.-Japan bilateral relations and even the strategic 
situation in the Asia-Pacific will be severely influenced." 
 
¶2. U.S. POLICY 
 
"'Quiet diplomacy' and 'smart power' in the present world" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao)(01/13)(pg 8): "The changes in the world's situation reflect 
the profound changes in the international political and economic 
structure, the balance of international forces and the significant 
difference between the development of and the reality of a situation 
that some western countries envisioned years ago.  Frequently 
imposing high-profile pressure, forcefully pushing values on to 
developing countries, and showing military strengths are less and 
less likely to be effective.  Policy adjustments are needed in order 
to confirm this trend.  'Quiet diplomacy' which was pledged by the 
EU Foreign Minister and 'smart power' which is being promoted by the 
U.S. Secretary of State are both aimed at advancing their countries' 
and the two major Western economies' own interests.  People hope to 
see less noise, more understanding and communication with each other 
within developed countries' foreign policy." 
 
¶3. NORTH KOREA 
 
"The U.S. refuses North Korea's advice on peace talks" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/13)(pg 2): "The U.S. has refused the North 
Korean Foreign Ministry's advice about peace talks, claiming North 
Korea must first fulfill its promise of giving up its nuclear 
programs and then both sides can discuss a peace agreement.  The 
North Korean Ambassador to China said on January 12 that if the U.S. 
disagrees with having negotiations on a peace agreement and removing 
sanctions against North Korea, then North Korea will not rejoin the 
Six-Party Talks.  He also said that those sanctions represent 
prejudice and distrust.  It would be best for both parties to sit 
and have direct talks.  The South Korean media suggest that possibly 
North Korea believes that it would rather ruffle feathers and play 
the peace agreement-card than just obediently return to Six-Party 
Talks negotiations.  As time goes by, the back-and-forth between the 
U.S. and North Korea will intensify even more.  In fact North Korea 
continues its economic construction despite the world's 
speculations.  North Korea's new currency policy is still beginning 
to take shape and its market order has not resumed its previous 
level from before the DPRK implemented the policy."
