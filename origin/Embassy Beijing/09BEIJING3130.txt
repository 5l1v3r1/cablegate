PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VISIT TO CHINA 
 
a. "American public diplomacy's new extension" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(11/17)(pg 2): 
"It now appears that the briefing that was held at the U.S. Embassy 
in Beijing on the afternoon of November 12 for the main bloggers in 
China was meant not only to listen to the bloggers' thoughts about 
President Obama's first visit to China, but also to leverage them to 
pass on to Internet users the United States' message that 'we are 
coming.'  This was an example of U.S. public diplomacy outreach to 
Chinese Internet users.  This was not a one-off event connected with 
President Obama's visit to China, but rather just the start.  The 
second such event was the Town Hall meeting that Obama had with 
college students in Shanghai on November 16, which was billed as a 
'dialogue.'  A few years ago an American diplomat said that the U.S. 
government was putting more emphasis on public diplomacy and had 
arranged trainings in this field.  The goal of the U.S. government's 
public diplomacy efforts is to make contact with local people as 
much as possible, not merely facilitate government-to-government 
exchanges.  In October, U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman 
visited Guangzhou, where he went to an English-language school for 
the disabled.  Using his influence, the U.S. Ambassador was able to 
bring the school to the media's attention.  This case highlights the 
benefits of public diplomacy: it is not a problem as long as it is 
done in the right place and benefits the receiver." 
 
b. "Obama reiterates U.S. intention not to contain China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/17)(pg 1): "President Obama set the basic 
tone for China-U.S. relations in Shanghai.  Professor Miu Qihao at 
the Shanghai Science and Technology Information Research Institute 
said that choosing Shanghai as the first stop of the visit is a sign 
of maturity in China-U.S. exchanges, and provided a channel for 
discussing issues other the major political ones.  By commenting on 
certain issues in China-U.S. relations in Shanghai, the United 
States was able to test the international reaction first and give 
both China and itself more room to maneuver [before President Obama 
met China's political leaders in Beijing].  Professor Zhao Guojun at 
the Shanghai Academy of Social Science's Center for International 
Affairs said that Obama's visit has definitely upgraded China-U.S. 
relations.  In contrast to previous U.S. presidential visits, Obama 
has paid a lot of attention to bilateral cooperation and set higher 
expectations for the relationship.  Despite differing views on the 
idea of a 'strategic partnership,' the general trend in China-U.S. 
relations is towards greater cooperation." 
 
c. "Dialogue is good and beneficial" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(11/17)(pg 
1): "Soon after landing in China, Obama started a dialogue with 
students, which is a very good thing.  President Obama's dialogue 
with the Shanghai municipal government and the people of Shanghai 
shows his emphasis on this major economic and cultural city in 
China.  It is also noteworthy that Obama said that China's success 
is not necessarily a threat to other countries, and that the United 
States' success is not necessarily an example for other countries. 
Such rational and honest thinking reflects his wisdom as the leader 
of modern America.  The questions asked by the students in Shanghai, 
which were obviously directed at certain bilateral issues, show that 
China's younger generation has a sober understanding of certain 
structural and strategic conflicts in the China-U.S. bilateral 
relationship.  We did not expect that a one-time, American-style 
Town Hall meeting would solve these major issues.  We sincerely hope 
that Obama will listen to more Chinese people and help the Chinese 
people gain a better understanding of the United States."
