¶1. On March 26, PolOff joined Lee Heon, Director at the South

Secretary at the Russian Embassy in Beijing, in extending an 
invitation to China to attend a Global Initiative to Combat 
Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) workshop and Exercise Planning 
Group (EPG) meeting in Seoul on April 14-16 to MFA Arms 
Control and Disarmament Department Nuclear Division Deputy 
Director Zhang Shen.  Lee provided ref A invitation to Zhang 
as well as a proposed workshop agenda, and invited China to 
give a presentation at the workshop.  PolOff emphasized that 
the follow-on EPG meeting, jointly chaired by the United 
States and Russia, would provide an opportunity for GICNT 
partners to discuss and make plans for the 2009-2010 exercise 
program. 
 
¶2.  Zhang thanked Lee and PolOff for the information and said 
he would consult within the Chinese government to determine 
who might attend the workshop and EPG meeting.  Zhang noted 
that China was an active member of the GICNT that had 
attended all previous GICNT plenary meetings and most 
workshops, and would "do its best" to attend this workshop as 
well.  Noting the short time remaining until the meeting, 
Zhang said China would notify South Korea, the United States 
and Russia when the decision was made.
