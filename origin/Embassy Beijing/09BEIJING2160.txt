Â¶1.  U.S. - CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a. "Ma Ying-Jeou's reply to Hu Jintao triggers speculation" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (07/29): "KMT Chairman Ma Ying-Jeou's taking 
office is beneficial for the improvement of cross-strait relations. 
However, cross-strait relations also face three challenges.  The 
first challenge is from the KMT internally.  Some KMT members are 
prone to an independent Taiwan and intend to internationally 
legitamize the 'Republic of China' and create a 
'government-to-government' situation.  Second, is an anti-Ma 
Ying-Jeou attitude from the Democratic Progressive Party.  The third 
challenge is from the international community, primarily the U.S. 
and Japan.  They are afraid that an improvement in cross-strait 
relations will make the Taiwan Strait into an inland sea in China. 
The focus of U.S. policy on Taiwan may shift from 'anti-Taiwan 
independence' to 'anti-China unification.'  Taiwan's political 
situation is uncertain, and its political party politics are still 
unstable.  The development of cross-strait relations will largely 
rely on the increased power of the mainland. This is also the most 
important factor for the  promotion of Taiwan's reunification with 
the motherland." 
 
 
b. "Japan allowed the 'female advocate for Xinjiang independence' 
entry" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (07/29): "China should possess a tool to 
contain Japan and other countries that take unfriendly moves against 
China.  Since China is getting stronger and stronger, the space for 
cultivating such a tool is getting bigger and bigger.  The most 
important thing is to have diplomatic determination.  We must be 
clear that a friendly relationship with Japan is not only up for 
negotiation but is also fighting.  Beijing scholar Wang Xiaodong 
said that 'since Japan and the United States could disregard the 
crimes of Kadeer, openly supporting the enemy of China, China should 
also refuse to recognize the people identified as terrorists by 
Japan and the U.S. and instead support these countries' enemies. 
China is now a major power.  It should be able to create the 
political means to contain other major powers.  The reason the 
United States is powerful, to some extent, is because it has many 
means to deal with other countries." 
 
c. "Sino-U.S. relations must abandon the historical game" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (07/29): "There are people, both in China and 
the United States, worrying that each will win less and lose more in 
the game between the two powers.  Nowadays, the Sino-U.S. 
relationship is far more mature than it has been in the past.  But 
mature does not mean a mega-scale high-level exchange, nor does it 
mean a broad-range communication scheme, but it means mutual trust. 
The foundation of the Sino-U.S. relationship is still not solid; the 
reason being a lack of mutual trust.  Hostility is fading away. 
However, suspicion is still there.  The greatest test of the future 
Sino-U.S. relationship is whether the two countries will avoid a 
zero sum competition between big powers.  The two countries need to 
make a constant effort to avoid this type of game, and succeed in 
their great experiment, by leveraging the trust that they have 
accumulated over the past 30 years."
