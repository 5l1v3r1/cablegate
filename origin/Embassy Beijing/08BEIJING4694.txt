¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"China must avoid provoking the sensitive nerves of the U.S." 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/30): "An American professor indicates that 
U.S. studies concerning China have emphasized political issues over 
the past 50 years but, have now changed to emphasizing economics. It 
symbolizes a new phase of the U.S.-China relationship and U.S. 
studies concerning China. This is symbolic because, generally, 
economics are the most important concern in the relationships of the 
U.S. and its allies. Over the past 30 years, the majority of 
U.S.-China exchanges have been disputes over political issues. 
Because of the political differences between the two countries, 
there have been many conflicts concerning stances and ideology. 
However, today the verbal conflicts between the two countries have 
largely decreased. For China, more substantial cooperation between 
the U.S. and China may cause the U.S. to overreact. Therefore China 
should insist on maintaining its own interests in dealing with the 
U.S. First, it should learn and recognize what the U.S. is most 
sensitive about and take actions to avoid provoking the U.S.'s 
sensitive nerves. The U.S. needs time to acclimate to the new role 
that China will play as an equal country to itself. In some cases, 
China should care about the feelings of the U.S. Appropriate and 
timely communication can avoid misunderstandings and misjudgment, 
especially when the U.S.-China mutual trust is still rather low. For 
the next 30 years, the mature, stable and practical U.S.-China 
relationship will act as the main driver and leading power in global 
development." 
 
¶2. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
"RMB's internationalization makes an important step forward" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(12/30): "Recently the State Council decided to 
give settling trades with ASEAN in certain regions a trial run. This 
means the RMB can be directly used as an import-export settlement 
currency in these regions. The rapid growth of China's economy has 
greatly influenced neighboring regions, which make it necessary to 
build a RMB currency zone. Setting up such a zone is not challenging 
the U.S. dollar, but suggesting the need for regional economic 
integration. Although the RMB is not yet an exchangeable currency, 
the Chinese government has recently stepped up its efforts towards 
the internationalizing of the RMB. Upgrading the RMB to a regional 
trade-settlement currency is a necessary path towards 
internationalizing the currency."
