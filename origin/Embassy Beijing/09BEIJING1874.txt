  Editorial Quotes

¶1. XINJIANG RIOT 
 
"Supporting Rabiye Qadir is being the enemy of the Chinese people" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/07): "The fierce violence that happened on 
the evening of July 5th in Urumqi, Xinjiang province has destroyed 
the local people's regular life and China's peaceful development. 
It is the Xinjiang Independence Extremists who have created this 
terrorist threat.  The riot is a severe crime that was orchestrated 
from a distance and encouraged by external forces.  It has been 
implemented by a specific domestic organization.  The World Uyghur 
Congress, represented by Rabiye, is a terrorist force and becomes 
more rampant with the west's encouragement.   Facts have shown that, 
supported by the west's anti-China forces, the Eastern Turkistan 
Islamic Movement, Eastern Turkistan Liberation and World Uyghur 
Congress are the 'three strengths' that plotted and jointly 
conducted the Xinjiang Independence activities.  The west has even 
proposed that Rabiye to be nominated for a Nobel peace prize.  This 
is a double standard in the War on Terror and the Chinese people 
won't accept it.  Supporting Rabiye is being the enemy of the 
Chinese people, destroying the War on Terror and destroying world 
peace." 
 
¶2. ENVIRONMENT 
 
"The new U.S. 'carbon tariff' is an economic and hegemonic measure" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/07):  "The financial crisis has incited a 
new round and new format of U.S. trade protectionism.  The 'buying 
American' effect persists, while specific trade protectionism 
measures against China are increasing.  The recently-passed bill 
concerning tariff collections on imported goods that are not 
equivalent to U.S. carbon emission standards is obviously pointed at 
China.  The Chinese spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce has 
indicated that 'carbon tariff' collecting violates WTO's basic 
rules.  It uses environmental protection to conduct trade 
protectionism.  Along with globalization, China has become an 
important party in the industrial supply chain. The division of work 
on products has further transferred exports, originally from the 
U.S., to China. It is unfair to let developing countries cover the 
cost of increased carbon emissions while ignoring the 
responsibilities of developed countries, which have emitted carbon 
for more than 200 years.  Carbon tariffs reflect that the U.S., as 
the country in the center of everything, conducts economic hegemony 
against its surrounding countries." 
 
¶3. HONDURAS 
 
"The President in exile hasn't succeeded in returning to his 
country. Honduras slides into an abyss of turbulence." 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(07/07): "Wang Peng, scholar from the 
Latin America Research Institute - Chinese Academy of Social 
Sciences said that currently, the temporary government has been 
unprecedentedly isolated. There is no country in the Western 
Hemisphere, or the whole world, which is willing to support this new 
government.  In fact, the temporary government is under great 
pressure.  The U.S. severely condemns the coup in Honduras, which is 
obviously different from its attitude towards the Venezuelan coup 
that took place in April 2002.  At that time, the U.S. didn't admit 
it was a coup.  The economy of Honduras greatly relies on external 
assistance and markets.  At present, the situation in Honduras 
depends on how long the temporary government can stand the great 
pressure and whether the world will upgrade that pressure.  Some 
observers are concerned that this coup will pose a threat to the 
security of Central America.  On July 5th, the temporary president 
of Honduras condemned Nicaragua while its troops moved towards the 
border between the two countries.  Scholar Wang Peng suggests that 
the economy of Nicaragua is not quite developed.  The cost of waging 
a war is huge.  Only one country can interfere in this situation 
with its armed forces.  That is the U.S."
