  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  INFLUENCE OF NGOS 
 
"China hampered due to lack of non-governmental organizations" (pg 
14) 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(08/25): "Foreign non-governmental 
organizations and 'transnational social movements' are increasingly 
affecting China's image abroad and its internal stability.  However, 
because of the lack of Chinese NGOs, China does not have a similar 
influence abroad.  China is hampered in its foreign relations 
because of the shortage of Chinese NGOs.  These days, the 
international community expresses its strategic hostility towards 
China through NGOs; however, there are no similar organizations in 
China that can counter the influence of these foreign NGOs.  Western 
societies would rather believe [Uyghur activist] Rebiya Kadeer's 
false remarks than believe the Chinese government's explanation 
about the 'July 5' incident in Xinjiang because Westerners tend to 
doubt official versions of events as being merely propaganda.  China 
has underestimated the impact NGOs have on a government's influence. 
 Using NGOs to promote a particular political agenda has become a 
common practice in international politics.  China's NGOs should be 
immediately brought up on the agenda." 
 
¶2.  MILITARY WEBSITES 
 
"Launch of Ministry of National Defense website shows China's 
confidence" (pg 2) 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(08/25): "In the Internet era, we should recognize 
that maintaining secrecy is one kind of strength, but transparency 
is an equal, if not greater, strength.  China's military departments 
should not ignore the influence of the Internet.  By showcasing 
advanced weaponry, the website of the U.S. Department of Defense has 
made good use of the Internet to fight psychological warfare against 
its potential opponents.  China could also use its Ministry of 
National Defense (MND) website to disprove some Western countries 
deliberate attempts to downplay China's military strength, or to 
influence the citizens of other countries.  In addition, showing 
China's advanced weapons and research projects in an appropriate way 
on the [MND] website will improve the world's perception of 'Made in 
China' products." 
 
¶3.  U.S. CORPORATE BRIBERY 
 
"U.S. companies involved in giving bribes in more than 30 countries" 
(pg 1) 
 
The China Radio International-sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(08/25): "The State-Owned Assets Supervision and 
Administration Commission has expressed concern over the case of the 
U.S. company Control Component Inc. (CCI), which allegedly bribed 
many Chinese companies.  In a recent press release, the U.S. 
Department of Justice listed nine Chinese companies as having taken 
bribes from CCI.  The Justice Department filed a case against CCI 
based on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which was passed to 
restrict U.S. companies from bribing foreign government officials. 
The Act's definition of 'foreign government officials' includes 
employees of foreign state-owned enterprises.  U.S. media have not 
paid much attention to this case, whereas Chinese media have."
