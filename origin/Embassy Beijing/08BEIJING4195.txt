  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. CHINA AND LATIN AMERICA 
 
"A naturally occurring strategic promotion of relationships" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao) (11/11): "In the past month, the relationship 
between China and Latin American countries has greatly improved. 
Evidenced by the Chinese government launching its first ever policy 
papers on Latin America and the Caribbean region last month, mapping 
out an overall blueprint for future cooperation between the two 
sides. In order to sustain economic development, China is relying 
more and more on the resources of these countries, and their energy 
products such as crude oil. The recent economic growth of Latin 
America has been driven by the rising prices of their primary 
products due to large amounts of importing by China. China is now 
the third largest trade partner with Latin America. This trend will 
no doubt continue. Both sides have a shared interest in trying to 
avoid being victimized by the U.S. and European countries during the 
financial crisis. It is this shared interest that brings them 
together and there has been no geopolitical conflict in the history 
of their bilateral relations. During the financial crisis, the U.S. 
and Europe are likely to shift the disadvantages to Latin America 
and China." 
 
¶2. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
a. "Can Gulf Countries do something to 'save the market'" 
 
The official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) People's 
Daily (Renmin Ribao) (11/12): "Recently, the British Prime Minister 
Gordon Brown paid a visit to the Gulf Countries urging them to help 
IMF tackle the financial crisis. The Gulf Countries' reaction was 
not very positive. They mentioned that they are waiting for the new 
U.S. president to take office, and for the U.S. - Middle East policy 
to become clearer. By waiting, they can bargain with the 
administration, possibly influencing future U.S.-Middle East 
policies. The second reason they intend to wait is that Gordon Brown 
is a 'light weight'. Had the visit come from an American President, 
it would have attracted a more positive response. Gulf countries do 
not want to become a 'free ATM' or to become trapped in the 
financial crisis. Third, the Gulf countries are worried about the 
opinions of the British media. After all, whether the Gulf countries 
would like to help by providing funds depends on whether their 
rights to speak to their positions will increase in the reformed 
future international financial system." 
 
b. "Don't compare China's GDP with that of the U.S." 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (11/12): "The media has been saying that 
'China will surpass the U.S. in a few years' and that 'the financial 
crisis will help China outplay the U.S. sooner'. People who hold 
those opinions have either never been to the U.S. or have never been 
to China. The difference between the two nations in natural 
resources must not be overlooked. For China, if you compare the GDP 
with that of the U.S. there can be three outcomes. First, before 
China achieved No. 1 in GDP, the Chinese people already learned the 
negative aspects of the American lifestyle such as high consumption 
and wastefulness. Second, if China focuses only on GDP there will be 
a growing disparity between rich and poor, leading to social 
turbulence. Thirdly, competing in GDP consumes more resources. China 
will suffer from this. Just as the USSR competed with America in the 
space war, China will be the looser."
