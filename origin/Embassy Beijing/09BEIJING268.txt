  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S. POLICY 
 
a. "Financial crisis leads to a reduction in the U.S. military 
budget---this is a bonus in the crisis" 
 
21 Century Business Heral (21Shiji Jingji Baodao) under Guangdong 21 
century publishing company Ltd. (02/04): "During this financial 
downturn, America, Russia and several other countries cannot afford 
their military funds. U.S. Defense Secretary Gates has expressed 
that there might be the possibility of cooperation between the U.S. 
and Russia on the missile defense system even though the two 
countries have had disagreements.  For the U.S., the country needs 
to focus on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and to cut their military 
budget for future defense programs. It is logical for the U.S. to 
reduce their military budget. Especially in the Obama era, if the 
government cuts their budget in security they will be headed for the 
'right track'; ending the expenditures on military preparations and 
ending their involvement with nuclear programs. This would be a 
rational choice for the U.S." 
 
b. "The Buy American bill has damaged the interests of others, and 
doesn't benefit the U.S." 
 
The official Xinhua Daily Telegraph (Xinhua Meiri Dianxun) (02/04): 
"The 'buying American goods' bill is an additional item of President 
Obama's large-scale economic stimulus plan and has aroused great 
attention and severe criticism globally. Some countries indicate 
that they will not just sit and watch as the U.S. seeks trade 
protectionism. In the current deteriorating economic situation, 
various forms of trade protectionism are brewing. However, 
historically, trade protectionism has taught the world many lessons. 
It is noticeable that many American companies, media and economists 
are criticizing the recent methods of U.S. trade protectionism. The 
idea that buying American goods will promote American employment 
can't stand. ...The U.S. is the largest and most developed global 
economic body. It possesses more advantages and interests than other 
countries in international trade. Therefore, the U.S. has always 
advocated free trade. However, when the financial crisis began, the 
U.S. chose to ignore their responsibilities and instead adopt trade 
protectionism. This is an unwise and short-sighted measure." 
 
¶2. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"Biden may be in charge of China Affairs" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/04): "The American Foreign Policy Magazine 
recently stated that Vice President Biden may become the head 
[leader, spokesperson] of U.S.-China policy. The U.S. government did 
not respond to this news. Recently Paulson and Zoellick have led 
this field. If Vice President Biden becomes the lead in China 
policy, it indicates that China has become increasingly important to 
the U.S.'s strategic considerations because the level of the people 
involved has been continuously upgraded. 
 
The U.S. media has altogether kept silent on the recent news, by 
Japanese media, that the U.S.-China dialogue has been upgraded, 
however all media sources have reported on the dispute between 
Secretary Clinton and Geitner in who should assume responsibility 
for U.S.-China policy. The U.S. media believes that Secretary 
Clinton intends to snatch leadership of the U.S.-China relationship 
from the Department of the Treasury. Chinese experts indicate that 
Geitner's criticism on China's currency manipulation has revealed 
his lack of expertise in both diplomacy and China policy. His 
comments were mainly aimed at the simple people, but they have 
aroused big trouble. The latest comments made by Vice President 
Biden were made to put out Geitner's fire. Some American scholars 
have brought about the concept of establishing an informal G2 for 
the U.S. and China. This proves the U.S.' emphasis on the 
relationship is very high.  The fact is that no matter how 
dissatisfied the U.S. is with China, it still needs to cooperate 
with China."
