d'Ivoire Foreign Minister, will visit China in May. 
 
Sudan: Weapon Sales, Peacekeepers 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  At the May 8 regular press briefing, MFA Spokeswoman 
Jiang Yu said Chinese weapons sales to Sudan have been 
limited to conventional weapons and that arms sales to Africa 
generally are of a "small-scale."  She called an Amnesty 
International report criticizing China for weapon sales to 
Sudan "groundless," adding that China takes a cautious, 
responsible approach to arms sales. 
 
¶3.  In response to questions on China's contributions to 
peacekeeping troops in Darfur, Jiang stated that more than 
400 Chinese peacekeepers are already on the ground and have 
extended their tours for six months.  The spokeswoman added 
that China will send a team of engineers to support the UN 
force during the second phase of the Annan plan.  All parties 
should stick to the "double-check" strategy in supporting a 
political solution in Darfur, said Jiang as she warned that 
no actions should be taken to further complicate the 
situation there. 
 
Japan and Yasukuni Shrine 
------------------------- 
 
¶4.  The Yasukuni Shrine issue is important and sensitive and 
China hopes Japan will abide by the consensus recently 
reached between the two countries on developing healthy 
relations, said Jiang when asked for China's reaction to PM 
Abe's offering of a plant at the shrine. 
 
Nothing New on Six-Party Talks, BDA 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. Jiang offered no new information in response to questions 
about Banco Delta Asia and restarting of the Six-Party Talks. 
 Relevant parties are currently working to resolve the 
remaining technical problems, she said. 
 
Protests in Macao 
----------------- 
 
¶6.  China supports Macao SAR government efforts to maintain 
stability and prosperity in accordance with the law, Jiang 
said in response to a question on May 1 demonstrations in the 
region the reporter said were over poor social conditions and 
the influx of cheap Mainland labor. 
 
Overseas Chinese Should be Good Global Citizens 
--------------------------------------------- --

¶7.  Reporters asked about reports of recent unrest in Chinese 
communities of Barcelona, Spain and Milan, Italy.  Jiang said 
China requests that its citizens abroad contribute to local 
society while respecting local laws and hopes foreign 
governments will safeguard the rights and interests of 
resident Chinese citizens and local citizens of Chinese 
ethnicity. 
 
Contaminated Food and Drug Exports 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  China has strict regulations governing its pharmaceutical 
industry and the materials it uses, said Jiang when asked to 
comment on a case of tainted drug products in Panama.  The 
China State Food and Drug Administration (CSFDA) investigated 
this case last year at the request of the United States FDA 
and found the relevant Chinese company was not a certified 
medical producer, Jiang added.  She referred all questions 
regarding the melamine import case, FDA inspectors in China, 
the arrest of Mao Li and deaths of Guangzhou pigs to the 
CSFDA and relevant local authorities. 
 
Li Zhaoxing Retirement Due to Age 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  The spokeswoman pointed to the "retirement age" 
restrictions when asked why former FM Li had been replaced by 
new FM Yang Jiechi.  Jiang added that Li had made great 
contributions to and would continue to support China's 
foreign affairs. 
 
Canada FM Visit, Huseyin Celil Case 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  FM MacKay of Canada met with FM Yang and State Councilor 
Tang Jiaxuan during a recent visit to China, confirmed Jiang. 
 Asked about Canadian consular access to Uighur-Canadian 
Huseyin Celil, who was convicted in Urumqi on terrorism 
charges, Jiang said Celil is a Chinese citizen according to 
international law and was an integral member of an 
international terrorist organization.  China hopes the two 
countries can properly handle such disputes for the good of 
the long-term bilateral relationship. 
 
Reeducation-Through-Labor Camps 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  China opposes interference in China's internal affairs 
by the German government, said Jiang when asked for comment 
on a possible German government resolution condemning China's 
reeducation-through-labor camps.  China's use of the camps 
has a legal basis and serves to reduce crime and protect the 
legal rights and interests of the Chinese people. 
 
Mexico Trade Dispute Needs Fair Resolution 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶12.  China resolves trade disputes based on equality and 
mutual benefit, said Jiang responding to the ongoing WTO 
dispute between Mexico and China over high Mexican tariffs on 
Chinese textile imports.  Jiang referred specific questions 
to the Ministry of Commerce. 
 
Visits: Vietnam, Rwanda, Cote d'Ivoire 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶13.  At the invitation of President Hu, Vietnam President 
Triet will pay a state visit to China May 15-18 as will 
President Kagame of Rwanda May 13-18.  The Cote d'Ivoire FM 
will pay an official visit May 9-18.  Premier Wen will attend 
the Asia Development Bank 2007 Shanghai meeting May 16-17 
where he will deliver a speech.
