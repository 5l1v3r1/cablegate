¶1. FINANCE 
 
"U.S. political whip wounds Sino-U.S. trade" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/23)(pg 14): "Growing Sino-U.S. economic 
and trade ties seem to have been beaten by a whip.  This whip is in 
fact the American people's 'political calculation.'  U.S. high-tech 
exports to China have been impeded by this whip.  Chinese people who 
want to do normal business or acquire companies in the U.S. are 
under constant political interference.  Recently, the United States' 
St. Eugene Mining Corporation Ltd. announced that a Chinese mining 
company was forced to abandon its takeover offer since the Committee 
on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) will propose 
stopping the transaction to Obama. Just as it did four years ago, 
history is repeating itself. Due to the obstruction of the CFIUS, 
the acquisition of American Unocal Corp. by China National Offshore 
Oil Corporation (Cnooc) has failed.  It seems that there is still 
the same political mentality in the minds of some people in 
Washington.  Chinese businesses are often monitored by Washington's 
'political radar' even when they are trying to do business in a 
third country.  If the U.S. government can break this political whip 
they could focus more on the positive side and bring the United 
States more opportunities. " 
 
¶2. KOREAN PENINSULA 
 
"The situation on the Korean Peninsula is becoming complex once 
again" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(12/23)(pg 
13): "Chen Xiangyang, a researcher of the Division for Korean 
Peninsula Studies at the China Institute of Contemporary 
International Relations, pointed out that the confrontations and 
disputes between the DPRK and South Korea over the sea boarder, as 
well as the restoration of a military hotline indicates that each of 
the two countries has their own agenda. South Korea would like to be 
seen as the 'victim' of the DPRK's 'provocation' and the DPRK wants 
to highlight the necessity for negotiations and peace agreements on 
the Korea Peninsula.  All these facts indirectly remind the United 
States that based on their 2007 meeting with South Korean and DPRK 
leaders, they must convert the armistice mechanism for the Korean 
Peninsula into a peace mechanism." 
 
¶3. CHINA AND COMBODIA 
 
"Cambodia's repatriation of Chinese has nothing to do with aid" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/23)(pg 3): "Considering the Western 
accusations following Cambodia's repatriation of 20 illegal Chinese 
Xinjiang Uighur immigrants, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman 
Jiang Yu said, 'the relevant accusations against us are groundless. 
China and Cambodia have maintained a comprehensive partnership of 
cooperation and we have provided aid to Cambodia within our 
capacity.  This aid has no strings attached...  According to my 
knowledge, some of the Uighurs are suspects in criminal cases.'  Zhu 
Yuzhu, an English editor of Cambodia's Jianhua Daily [a Cambodian 
newspaper run by Chinese Cambodians], said that there is nothing 
wrong with a sovereign state making a decision which considers its 
national interests.  If the United States can abandon so-called 
universal values like human rights to make a compromise in Cambodia 
[a reference to Sen. John Kerry' letter to the U.S. Congress Human 
Rights Commission on the rule of law and human rights issues in 
Cambodia], then why can't Cambodia make its own choice out of its 
own national interests.   Moreover, such a choice is made within the 
law."
