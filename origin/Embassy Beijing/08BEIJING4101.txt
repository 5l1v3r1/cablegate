¶1.  Key points at the October 30 afternoon MFA press briefing were: 
 
 
-- In the case of kidnapped Chinese workers in Sudan, four of whom 
were killed October 27, a Chinese delegation will urge the Sudanese 
Government to "spare no effort to rescue the missing workers, bring 
the criminals to justice and take measures to protect Chinese 
citizens in Sudan." 
 
-- China is "having discussions with the United States on specifics" 
of the upcoming summit on the global financial crisis. 
 
-- China is committed to working with other countries and 
international institutions to "safeguard the stability of global 
markets and promote economic growth." 
 
-- China "believes whichever candidate wins the U.S. presidential 
election will place great importance on U.S.-China relations" and 
believes that the RMB exchange rate is not the cause of the U.S. 
trade deficit. 
 
-- China is in consultation with the other parties to the Six-Party 
Talks on a date for the next heads of delegation meeting. 
 
Sudan Hostage Crisis 
-------------------- 
¶2. A delegation including representatives from the MFA, Ministry of 
Commerce and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) departed 
October 30 for Sudan to deal with the aftermath of the hostage 
crisis, said MFA spokesperson Jiang Yu at the October 30 regularly 
scheduled press briefing.  The delegation will urge the Sudanese 
Government to "spare no effort to rescue the missing workers, bring 
the criminals to justice and take measures to protect Chinese 
citizens in Sudan."  In response to a question about discrepancies 
between Sudanese and Chinese reports on the number of victims, Jiang 
said that four workers were killed "during a government rescue 
effort," three were rescued and are receiving medical treatment and 
two are still missing. 
 
Financial Crisis and Summit 
--------------------------- 
¶3. Jiang said China has received the U.S. invitation to attend a 
summit meeting on the financial crisis.  China "is considering 
taking part and is having discussions with the United States on 
specifics of the summit."  Once Chinese participation is confirmed, 
the MFA will release information.  Jiang said the international 
community needs to address the global financial crisis together. 
She noted that China is committed to working with other countries 
and international institutions such as the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) to "safeguard the stability of global markets and promote 
economic growth." 
 
Chinese RMB Appreciation 
------------------------ 
¶4. Responding to a question on U.S. presidential candidates' 
comments on the need for revaluation of China's currency, Jiang said 
the RMB exchange rate is not the cause of the U.S. trade deficit. 
She noted "whichever candidate wins the election will place great 
importance on U.S.-China relations" and expressed hope that the 
United States will "reduce barriers to trade and investment." 
 
Six-Party Talks 
--------------- 
¶5. In response to a question on the timing of the next round of 
Six-Party Talks, Jiang said China is consulting with the other 
parties on a date for the next heads of delegation meeting.  China 
will work together with other parties "to implement the remaining 
tasks of the second phase of the Six-Party Talks," Jiang added. 
 
Tibet Talks 
----------- 
¶6. In response to a question about the next round of talks on Tibet 
between the Chinese Government and representatives of the Dalai 
Lama, Jiang would only say that "relevant Chinese Government 
authorities will release information in due course."
