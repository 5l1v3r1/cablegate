  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. U.S. DIPLOMACY 
 
"Obama is not focused on China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/25): "An American expert has said that in 
the U.S., China studies programs are far less emphasized than 
studies concerning Europe, Russia, and the Middle East. This 
reflects China's position in the strategic blueprints of the U.S. It 
also reflects the different feelings of the two countries. Each 
country has different opinions, stances, and angles concerning 
important topics. For example, when the Chinese media is concerned 
about Obama's policy on China, public opinions in the U.S. are 
concerned with who will be the next secretary of the treasury. 
What's more, in the U.S. diplomatic system there is no specific 
China policy team. China is just a part of Eastern Asian or 
Asia-Pacific affairs. It is not possible, and not necessary, to make 
China the focus of the new U.S. administration. After all, China is 
not the ally of the U.S. and does not have common views with the 
U.S." 
 
¶2. TAIWAN 
 
"The U.S. blackmails Taiwan with 'patriot' missile" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/25): "It was reported last week that the 
U.S. had requested additional conditional support for the 6 billion 
USD arm sale to Taiwan. Taiwan opinioned that: the most expensive 
thing in the World is U.S. weapon sales. However, more and more 
Taiwanese analysts indicate that the relations across the Strait are 
warming up since Ma Ying-jeou became president. The possibility of a 
cross-strait military conflict has greatly decreased. The Taiwanese 
'legislative department' has strongly reacted to the increased of 
price by the U.S. Arms sales Taiwan are the strangest arms sales in 
the world. There is a debate about whether or not Ma Ying-jeou 
should continue these 'arms purchasing at a sucker's price' at Chen 
Shui-bian time. Mainland experts indicate that the status of the 
cross-strait military confrontation will not change. The U.S. arms 
sales to Taiwan will not stop, the U.S. will continue using Taiwan 
to contain the Mainland." 
 
¶3. CHINA'S RISE 
 
"China cautiously faces glory in the international community" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/25): "China has quickly been given glory 
in the international community because of its participation in two 
big international conferences, the G20 Summit and APEC. The Chinese 
government responded to this phenomenon modestly. China repeatedly 
emphasized that theirs is a developing country. Western media opined 
that China has behaved cautiously because China wants to play an 
important role in the financial crisis. Chinese experts indicate 
that China's economic strength has been exaggerated by the World, 
and that the degree of China's opening up has been underestimated. 
Chinese experts also indicate that China has reasons to maintain a 
low-profile and be cautious. Although China develops fast, the 
western part of China and the large area of countryside are still 
under developed. Besides this, China is also engaged with many 
serious issues brought on by the financial crisis. China's cautious 
style in the face of this glory is also based on China's traditional 
culture.  Chinese culture emphasizes the 'middle of the road', 
'moderation' and 'peace.'"
