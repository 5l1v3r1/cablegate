¶1. (SBU) Our concerns over the free speech implications of 
the OIC "defamation of religions" resolution will have little 
resonance with Chinese leaders.  China's regional and 
bilateral interests with certain OIC member states also make 
it unlikely that the PRC will publicly back the U.S. counter 
initiative.  The OIC-sponsored proposal is, in fact, unlikely 
to come to the attention of Chinese leadership and, absent a 
high-level policy decision, the Chinese mission in New York 
is highly unlikely to reverse its previous record of voting 
in favor of the resolution. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The International Organizations and Conferences 
Department Human Rights Affairs Division of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs told us, predictably, that China is "aware of 
the controversy" surrounding this issue but prefers that "all 
sides reach consensus through negotiations" in order to 
"address the interests of all parties."  In this context we 
believe there is little likelihood that the PRC will be 
responsive to diplomatic pressure to change its existing 
position on the resolution.
