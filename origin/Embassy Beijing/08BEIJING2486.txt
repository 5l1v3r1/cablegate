North Korea Nuclear Declaration and Six-Party Talks 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2. At the June 24, 2008 regular MFA press briefing, MFA Spokesman 
Liu Jianchao refused to provide an answer to repeated questions 
about the timing of the North Korean nuclear declaration, but said 
that the parties should carry out agreements in a "comprehensive and 
balanced manner."  Liu said that all parties are holding 
consultations to decide how to proceed with the talks and that China 
hopes these consultations will "produce results."  Asked whether 
North Korea would allow verification of its nuclear declaration, Liu 
said parties are holding consultations to solve this very important 
issue.  Asked why North Korea has taken so long to deliver its 
declaration, Liu said that the Six-Party Talks are "complicated" and 
"take time."  All parties are making efforts to implement the 
remainder of the second phase and stepping up consultations, said 
Liu. 
 
Zimbabwe Elections and Arms Shipment 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. Asked whether China still supports the holding of elections in 
Zimbabwe, Liu said that China is "concerned" about the situation in 
Zimbabwe and hopes that relevant parties complete the Presidential 
election smoothly through dialogue and peaceful means.  In response 
to a question about the Chinese arms shipment to Zimbabwe, Liu said 
that there were many rumors but that the Chinese ship containing the 
arms, the An Yue Jiang, had already returned to China. 
 
Japanese Port Call 
------------------ 
 
¶4.  Liu could not confirm that the Japanese warship that was 
scheduled to arrive in China today had actually arrived.  The ship's 
visit will promote exchanges between Japan and China and deliver 
earthquake relief for Sichuan, said Liu.  Liu said that he did not 
think the visit would provoke public anger. 
 
Mt. Everest Access, Foreign Journalists in Tibet 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5. Liu had not seen the reported comments of a government official 
from Tibet who said that China would limit access to Mr. Everest for 
environmental reasons.  Asked when foreign journalists would be 
allowed into Tibet, Liu said China is working hard to stabilize the 
region and will work to make the visits happen at an early date. 
 
Huang Qi Arrest 
--------------- 
 
¶6. Liu said he was not familiar with the case of human rights 
activist Huang Qi but said that Chinese people enjoy freedom of 
expression and that no one would be punished for expressing himself. 
 Liu said that the case would be dealt with in accordance with the 
law.
