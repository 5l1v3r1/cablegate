  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. NATO 
 
"NATO wants to borrow China's 'Wakhan Corridor'" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(03/04): "A Chinese military officer has said 
that it is impossible for China to open the Corridor to NATO in 
order to also help support military actions in Afghanistan. NATO has 
been frustrated that the military activities in Afghanistan have 
been stagnated. They have been seeking the help of Afghanistan's 
neighbors. China still has many difficulties in conducting any 
military cooperation with NATO, because it is led by the U.S. It is 
still too early to discuss such cooperation. It is possible that 
China cooperates with NATO on anti-terror and humanitarian issues, 
but not quite possible to have deep strategic cooperation with NATO. 
This is also because NATO still treats China and Russia as potential 
challenges. NATO's request to go through China is directly relevant 
with Kyrgyzstan's decision to shut down the air base. China has 
seldom cooperated with NATO on political and military issues. China 
only accepts peace-keeping activities led by the UN and has to 
consider Russia's feelings, because Russia is still having 
confrontations with NATO." 
 
¶2. U.S. POLITICS 
 
"Where is the U.S.' fragility" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(03/04): "A country's power is undergoing a 
moment of unprecedented fragility, including the U.S.', which is 
worth our attention. The recent financial crisis has updated 
people's opinions, worldwide, concerning the U.S. The U.S. is not as 
strong as they once imagined. One needs to examine three aspects in 
order to see a country's power: first, possessing a 'gun', second, 
possessing a 'useful gun', for example; a pistol is useful to a 
person 10 meters away, but not for a person 10 km away. And third, 
the ability to let the person, who is 10 meters away from you, know, 
that you will shoot. All of these factors don't lead to a simple 
conclusion as to whether the U.S. will fall. However, in today's 
state of globalization, infrastructure building, networking and more 
internationalized activities, the fragility of these countries' 
power has increased. The changes to a country's power and position 
are not simply dictated by Country A replacing Country B in their 
hegemonic lead. However, the international situation is full of 
uncertainties and chaos." 
 
¶3. CHINA'S NUCLEAR STRATEGY 
 
"What kind of nuclear strategy should China follow?" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(03/04): "The world's nuclear set-up continues 
to maintain two superpowers and multiple power countries. The U.S. 
and Russia are maintaining a nuclear balance. What's more, today, 
nuclear countries treat nuclear weapons as the most important factor 
in maintaining the country's security. China should follow the 
strategy of 'effective defense' which emphasizes the effectiveness 
of having the capability to proactively defend yourself. Effective 
defense is helpful to maintain the country's security and 
continuously expand its interests. It is also helpful for China to 
contend against the threat posed by the world's military powers and 
regional hegemony." 
 
¶4. HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
"Clinton's diplomacy on human rights is spot on" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily commented 
(03/04): "...Some human rights groups and a section of the 
international media have said [Clinton] was too lenient with China 
on human rights. Was this really the case? Would China have lost 
something if she played hard on human rights? Let's first see what 
comprises human rights. It is true the concept originated in the 
West, but it would be unfair to say that China has not contributed 
to their development - both at home and abroad....Are human rights a 
very sensitive issue? As rights for all, they should not be. In 
fact, China has always tried to improve human rights and its 
constitution guarantees them to every citizen....Hence, human rights 
cannot be a sensitive issue for China unless vested interests link 
them to trade or non-political events such as the Olympic Games. 
Simply put, human rights become sensitive only when politicized."
