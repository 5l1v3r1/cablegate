  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  U.S.-CHINA MILITARY RELATIONS 
 
"One third of the United States' latest report devoted to the 
Chinese Navy" 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated to the 
official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (11/25) (pg 06): 
"A report issued by a special U.S. Congressional committee (the 
U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission) seems to have 
dumped cold water on the newly-established honeymoon relationship 
between the United States and China.  The report fabricated the 
possible threat posed by China's Navy and cyber warfare 
capabilities, which is misleading to the American public.  Chinese 
Embassy Spokesperson Wang Baodong said the committee has repeatedly 
accused China without any evidence in its annual reports.  The 
Financial Times said that U.S. suspicion that China poses a military 
threat is incompatible with the joint economic body that has been 
established between the two countries.  The goal of China's military 
development is definitely not to compete for hegemony with the 
United States, but rather to prevent the United States from harming 
China's core interests.  The American right wing has obviously 
twisted the facts." 
 
¶2.  U.S. RELATIONS WITH INDIA AND PAKISTAN 
 
"Where are relations between the U.S., India, and Pakistan heading?" 
 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao)(11/25)(pg 8): "The underlying problem in relations between 
Pakistan and India is the Kashmir dispute.  The two countries also 
have differences over the War on Terror, and each blames the other 
for launching terror attacks against it.  Furthermore, the two 
countries are still locked in an arms race with each other.  As the 
United States reviews its counterterrorism strategy, it is 
increasingly obvious that the United States will play a significant 
role in India-Pakistan relations.  Both India and Pakistan are 
hoping to gain the support of the United States in order to contain 
the other country.  Improved relations between the United States and 
Pakistan have, to some extent, softened India's position vis--vis 
Pakistan." 
 
¶3.  CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
"Chinese delegation urges countries to reach a substantive agreement 
at Copenhagen" 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(11/25)(pg A4): "Li Gao, the Director of 
the International Negotiations and International Policy Department 
in the Climate Change Division of the National Development and 
Reform Commission and a member of the Chinese delegation to 
Copenhagen, said that the Chinese delegation will push for a 
substantive climate change agreement at Copenhagen.  China will not 
accept the meeting ending with an empty political declaration.  In 
order to promote such an agreement, China will take more initiatives 
prior to the conference, many of which will be unveiled soon, such 
as a kick-off ceremony sponsored by Sohu.com's green forum for the 
Chinese delegation that will attend the Copenhagen conference.  More 
than 20 Chinese media outlets will go to Copenhagen to report on the 
conference, which shows significant progress and attention to the 
issue of climate change in China.  Chen Ying, the Deputy Director of 
the Center for Sustainable Development at the Chinese Academy of 
Social Sciences, said that the Chinese government will not support 
an international agreement that requires sacrificing the right to 
development.  Mr. Li added that verification is a controversial 
issue, but without solving it the Copenhagen conference will be 
fruitless.  He noted, however, that China has been making continuous 
efforts to deal with climate change."
