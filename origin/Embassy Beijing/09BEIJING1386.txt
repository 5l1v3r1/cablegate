CGPCS MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 50499 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) China's Ministry of National Defense would likely 
continue to push its proposal to put counter-piracy military 
operations in the Gulf of Aden under UN command, MFA 
International Organizations and Conferences (IO) Department 
UN Affairs Division official Jiang Hua told PolOff May 22 in 
response to reftel points regarding the May 29 meeting of the 
Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS). 
Jiang said China's delegation to the CGPCS meeting would be 
headed by China's Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, 
Ambassador Liu Zhenming, and would include MFA IO Department 
UN Affairs Division official Cheng Lie as well as one 
Ministry of Transportation (MOT) official and one Ministry of 
National Defense (MND) official yet to be identified.  Jiang 
said Chinese experts at the People's Bank of China and 
Ministry of Finance would study the U.S. proposal to create 
Working Group 5 on financial levers, noting that some 
countries were concerned that tracking and freezing pirates' 
assets would put an additional burden on those countries' 
financial institutions.
