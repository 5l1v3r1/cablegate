case of H1N1. 
 
-- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) transmitted to Embassy 
Beijing on May 12 a list confirming 40 AmCits now quarantined at the 
Guomen Hotel. All 40 were passengers on flight NW029 into Beijing on 
May 8.  Beijing ACS has been able to directly contact 27 of the 
AmCits quarantined at the Guomen Hotel. 
 
--Beijing Foreign Affairs Office (FAO) notified Beijing ACS that six 
other AmCits, four of whom were on the NW029 May 8 flight from 
Tokyo, are in quarantine at the Jin Lin Da Sha Hotel in Beijing. 
Another couple, who arrived in Beijing on May 11 on flight UA851 
from Chicago, was placed into quarantine at the Jin Lin Da Sha Hotel 
when airport screening showed the husband to have an elevated 
temperature. Beijing ACS has been in contact with all six AmCits. 
 
-- Shaanxi Provincial FAO reported that three AmCits who were on the 
May 8 NW029 flight have been quarantined at the Xi'an City Number 8 
Hospital. 
 
--Lanzhou Municipal FAO (in Gansu Province) notified Beijing ACS 
that one Amcit who was also on the May 8 NW029 flight is currently 
in home quarantine in Lanzhou. 
 
--The four AmCits, who were on board NW025 from Detroit to Tokyo 
(Narita) on May 8 with the four confirmed H1N1-infected Japanese 
passengers (who remain in Japan) and then continued onto Shanghai on 
May 9, are still in quarantine at the Jin Jiang Star Hotel. (Note: 
There were previously three confirmed H1N1 cases on flight NW025; a 
fourth passenger was confirmed to have H1N1 on May 11. See REF B) 
 
--Two AmCits who traveled to Beijing on the same May 8 NW029 Tokyo 
to Beijing flight and then flew onward to Guangzhou remain in 
quarantine in Guangzhou.

8 flight and then traveled on to Yunnan, remains in home 
quarantine.

INFORMING AMERICANS ABROAD OF NEW AIRPORT SCREENING PROCEDURES 
------------------- -------------------- --------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) A management notice was issued on May 12 informing Embassy 
staff and families of new airport screening procedures for flights 
arriving from the U.S. The new process, effective May 11, calls for 
health officials to board the aircraft to perform temperature 
readings on each passenger before disembarkation (REF A).

¶4. (U) According to local press reports, the Sichuan Health Bureau 
said that the H1N1 patient was doing well and in good spirits.  He 
is in quarantine with his father, girlfriend, and a local taxi 
driver who had come into contact with the patient. Vice Premier LI 
Keqiang visited the Chengdu Infectious Disease Hospital where the 
H1N1 patient is being treated and telephoned the patient. Li Keqiang 
said that China must be open and transparent in its H1N1 prevention 
work. 
 
¶5. (SBU) China CDC's National Influenza Laboratory has received H1N1 
rapid diagnostic test kits from U.S. CDC, which likely will shorten 
the time required for Chinese health officials to confirm any future 
cases.
