US-DPRK Meeting in Berlin, A/S Hill to Beijing 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2. MFA Spokesman Liu Jianchao said in the regular January 18 
press briefing that China welcomes news of the meeting 
between EAP Assistant Secretary Hill and DPRK nuclear envoy 
Kim Kye-Gwan in Berlin and supports direct contact between 
the parties.  China seeks to promote resumption of the 
Six-Party Talks at an early date and will maintain close 
contact with all parties involved. 
 
¶3. Liu confirmed that A/S Hill will visit Beijing "in the 
coming days" for discussions to push forward the Six-Party 
Talks.  Liu declined to give further details on Hill's visit, 
saying only that specifics were still under consideration. 
 
Athens Embassy Missile Not Chinese-Made? 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Reporters asked Liu if there will be an investigation into 
reports that the missile used to attack the American Embassy 
in Greece recently was made in China and asked what actions 
China is taking to ensure weapons from its past arms sales do 
not fall into terrorist hands.  Liu responded that China has 
not received proof that the missile was manufactured in China 
and observed that the international weapons market is 
"complex."  China only sells arms to sovereign countries and 
requires that buyers do not transfer the weapons without 
Chinese consent. 
 
Hu to Visit 8 African Nations, Including Sudan 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. Liu confirme that President Hu Jintao will visit Sudan, 
South Africa and six other African countries soon.  Further 
announcements will be made as plans are confirmed in the near 
future. 
 
New Guangzhou Bishop Approved Vatican? 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Liu deflected a request to confirm Hong Kong media reports 
that China and the Vatican jointly approved ordination of a 
bishop in Guangzhou.  China's position on the issue has not 
changed, Liu said.  China remains willing to establish normal 
state-to-state relations with the Vatican as long as the 
Vatican agrees to recognize the People's Republic of China as 
the government of the only China in the world and to refrain 
from interfering in China's internal affairs. 
 
Concern About Recent Japanese Military Push 
 
BEIJING 00000413  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Asked to comment on recent steps by Japan to increase its 
military presence and Japan's support for the EU ban on arms 
sales to China, Liu said China has noted Japan's actions, 
which have caused concern among its neighbors.  China has 
expressed its strong dissatisfaction through diplomatic 
channels and hopes Japan will develop peacefully and make 
greater efforts to improve bilateral relations with China 
instead of inciting trouble. 
 
Chinese Hostages in Nigeria Released 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶8. Liu said China was pleased by reports that five Chinese 
engineers taken hostage January 5 were released yesterday. 
Asked if a ransom was paid for their release, Liu declined to 
provide specifics of "the process." 
 
Rumored Visits of IMF President, Former PM Thaksin 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶9. Asked to confirm that former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin 
was in China, Liu said he had no information.  The spokesman 
had no information for reporters asking about a planned visit 
by the president of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
 
Visits: Estonian, ROK FMs; Hua Jianmin to Europe 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶10. Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet will pay an official 
visit to China January 23-26, and Foreign Minister Song 
Min-soon of Korea will visit January 25-27, both at the 
invitation of FM Li Zhaoxing.  State Councilor Hua Jianmin 
will travel to Europe January 24 - February 2.  Hua will

Davos, Switzerland and pay visits to Austria and Greece.
