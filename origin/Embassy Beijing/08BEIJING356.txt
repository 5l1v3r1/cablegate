Tainted Dumplings 
----------------- 
 
¶2. At the regularly-scheduled MFA press briefing January 31, 
MFA Spokesperson Liu Jianchao said China is taking a 
"responsible attitude" regarding pesticide-tainted dumplings 
that were exported to Japan.  He said the government has sent 
an inspection team to the plant where the dumplings were 
produced and has requested that distributors recall the 
product.  He said a preliminary investigation of samples of 
the dumplings in question did not indicate contamination, but 
that the investigation would continue. 
 
¶3. Liu emphasized that China is cooperating with the Japanese 
authorities on the matter, and that the Chinese 
Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection and 
Quarantine (ASQIQ) would provide additional information to 
the public later on January 31.  Liu noted that the 
government's investigation is ongoing and the Japanese 
government had not made a formal protest. 
 
DPRK 
---- 
 
¶4. Asked if EAP/K Director Sung Kim had met his Chinese 
counterparts during his stopover in Beijing, Liu said that he 
did not have specific information on whether meetings had 
taken place, but noted that they had been scheduled.  He said 
that the United States and China have ongoing consultations 
on the DPRK through the Six-Party process and that China is 
interested in continuing communication with the U.S. on the 
DPRK. 
 
¶5. Liu confirmed that Wang Jiarui, head of the Chinese 
Communist Party Central Committee's International Department, 
met Kim Jong-Il during Wang's recent trip to the DPRK.  He 
confirmed reports that Kim told Wang that current "problems" 
with the DPRK nuclear declaration are temporary and can be 
overcome. 
 
Chen Shui-bian Visit to Spratly Island 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Liu was asked about reports in the Taiwan media that Chen 
Shui-bian plans to head a team visiting Taiping Island, part 
of the Spratly Islands, for military activities.  Liu 
stressed that China has "indisputable sovereignty" over the 
Spratly Islands, adding that China has the ability to protect 
this sovereignty.  He added that China wants to work toward 
peace and stability in the South China Sea.  Liu declined to 
comment on a follow-up question that sought clarification on 
whether Beijing found acceptable a visit by a leader from 
Taiwan, which China also claims is part of Chinese territory, 
to the islands.

Regulations Regarding Providers of Financial Information 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶7. A reporter sought comment on statements from U.S. 
officials that the U.S. will increase pressure on China to 
lift restrictions on providers of financial information, 
including the possibility of the U.S. seeking action in the 
WTO.  Liu noted that there had been conflicting press reports 
on the issue.  He stressed that the government has been 
talking to foreign news agencies on the release of financial 
news in China and that they had received no complaints from 
the agencies, indicating that there are no problems. 
 
Sudan 
----- 
 
¶8. Liu was asked about Chinese Special Envoy for Darfur Liu 
Guijin's meetings with Sudan's Foreign Minister on the 
margins of the African Union Summit, in which Liu reportedly 
cautioned Sudan to avoid actions that would lead the 
international community to impose sanctions, and said that 
the world was running out of patience on the Darfur issue. 
The spokesperson said China urged the government in Sudan to 
"push ahead with the peace process" to restore stability, 
adding that China will continue to exchange views with Sudan 
and consult with the international community.  Liu added that 
China had not received complaints from the United States 
asking them intervene.
