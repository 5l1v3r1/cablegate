increasing attention to OSH, incorporating it into the 
five-year plan and other major economic policy documents. 
The Government is taking a number of legal, educational and 
technical measures to improve the OSH situation, including 
examining OSH records when evaluating the performance of 
local government officials and managers of enterprises.  He 
said China has tightened investigation procedures and 
increased punishments for workplace accidents, including 
punishing officials for holding shares in coal mines or 
colluding with employers to circumvent safety regulations. 
Minister Li also said the media plays an important role in 
alerting SAWS to mine accidents and publicizing Government 
efforts to investigate them. 
 
¶9.    (SBU)  Secretary Chao asked whether the collection and 
publication of OSH statistics is something new for China. 
Minister Li said the Government has maintained and published 
OSH statistics since 1949, but has recently improved its 
reporting.  He said the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) 
began publishing four new OSH indicators in 2005, including 
fatalities per 100 million RMB of GDP, fatalities per 100,000 
workers, fatalities per 10,000 registered motor vehicles, and 
coal mine fatalities per 100 million metric tons (mmt)of coal 
produced.  Minister Li said the Chinese Government will use 
these indicators to track progress in OSH.  For example, the 
2006-2011 five-year plan sets the goal of reducing the first 
two NBS indicators by 25 and 35 percent respectively over 
five years. 
 
¶10.  (SBU)  Minister Li said that projections for 2006 
indicate that workplace fatalities will be about 10 percent 
lower than in 2005, and 21 percent lower in the coal mining 
sector.  However, he said he warns his staff not to be 
complacent or boast about their achievements.  Li said 
China,s goal is to reach a level of workplace accidents 
comparable to a moderately developed country within 15 years. 
 He said that studying the experience of other countries, 
this is a rapid rate.  In the United States, for example, Li 
said, industrial accidents increased every year for 60 years 
before beginning to decline.  In the UK, this took 70 years, 
and in Japan, 26 years.  Minister Li said that countries with 
per capity GDP of $1000 to $3000 face the highest rates of 
industrial accidents. 
 
Problems in the Coal Sector 
--------------------------- 
 
¶11. (SBU)  Minister Li said there are 5.5 million coal miners 
in China, and 25,000 mines.  In 2005, China produced 2.2. 
billion tons of coal in 2005, a rate of 400 tons per worker, 
compared with a rate of 10,000 tons per worker in the United 
States.  There were 2.8 fatalities per mmt of coal produced 
in 2005, and SAWS expects the rate for 2006 to be 2.2. 
Minister Li acknowledge that this rate is about 100 times the 
rate of the United States (0.03).  Of the total number of 
coal mines, Minister Li said, 23,000 are classified as 
&small,8 meaning they produce less than 30,000 tons per 
year.  Li said these small mines are responsible for most of 
the accidents and fatalities.  Larger mines are highly 
mechanized and have much better safety records, Li said.  The 
small mines are labor-intensive and do not make necessary

investments in safety.  Li said all small coal mines are 
privately-owned, and that many of them are illegal.  (Note: 
most small mines are owned by township or county governments 
and contracted to private mine operators.  End note.) Li said 
the Central Government and most provincial governments are 
resolved to close these small mines, but face considerable 
resistance from county and township governments.  Li said the 
Government would use economic and technical measures to limit 
these small mines, access to the market, and thus force them 
out of business.  Part of this would be to require mine 
operators to pay royalties for the coal they extract, and 
force them to comply with higher environmental and safety 
standards. 
 
¶12.  (SBU)  Part of the mine safety problem, Minister Li 
said, is also the level of education of miners.  Fifty-six 
percent of all miners are migrant workers, with no work 
experience aside from farming, and low levels of education. 
The Minister added that in many parts of China, local farmers 
live on top of thin or low quality coal seams, and find it 
more profitable to illegally mine this coal than to farm.  Li 
said government policies to improve rural education would 
hopefully help workers protect themselves. 
 
¶13.  (SBU)  Recalling his experience as Chairman of Sinopec 
(one of China,s largest state-owned petroleum companies,) Li 
said China,s coal industry is underdeveloped.  Unlike most 
of China,s oil companies, Li said most of China,s coal 
companies are not publicly listed.  He said China,s coal 
sector needs to open itself up to the outside world to 
attract foreign capital and management expertise.
