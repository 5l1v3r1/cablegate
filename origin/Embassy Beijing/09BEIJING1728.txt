  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. North Korea 
 
"U.S. wants to use China to put sanctions on North Korea" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/24): "The two-day U.S. China Deputy 
Defense Minister level talks started yesterday in Beijing.  Such 
talks between the two countries have been frozen for about 18 
months.  North Korea's recent moves near China and the U.S. 
destroyer following North Korean ships have aroused much thought 
around the world.  The Pentagon also released the news that the U.S. 
hopes to gain China's cooperation in taking sanctions against North 
Korea.  Chinese experts say the U.S. and China have interests in 
common on the North Korean nuclear issue but China is not a U.S. 
ally, nor the assistant to the United States.  China should abide by 
its own principals, not doing inappropriate things.  This is the 
U.S.-China military exchanges for the first time since President 
Obama took office.  The world's focus is how the U.S. will persuade 
China.  However, the U.S. doesn't have much in hand to successfully 
persuade China.  A Chinese expert commented that the U.S. always 
wants China to lead while it just steps aside and watches.  It is 
not fair for China.  The U.S. intends to alienate China and North 
Korea in order to decrease the cost of reaching U.S.-North Korean 
conciliation." 
 
¶2. INTERNET SUPVERSITION 
 
a. "Don't abuse internet freedom; that is the best protection" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/24): "After the Google incident, internet 
freedom has become a hot topic.  China is not radical on internet 
supervision compared to its neighbor South Korea.  South Korea uses 
the real name system while China does not.  The internet is still at 
an early state and is relatively order-less.  The western media's 
criticism of internet supervision measures by the Chinese government 
has political goals.  It is consistent with their attitude towards 
China on many issues. The U.S. media is concerned over the Google 
incident not because of internet freedom, but the economic loss of 
the Google company.  This in fact shows the Chinese internet is very 
attractive to western companies.  Freedom on the internet is not 
easy; not abusively using it is the best protection for freedom." 
 
b. "Cops bust online firm selling live pornography" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (06/24): 
"Zhongshang, Guangdong: claimed to have arrested 37 people during 
raids on several hideouts of an underground Internet firm which 
specialized in online pornography. According to an official, the 
company hired a "number of 20-something women as typists" who were 
lured with offers of an extra buck to indulge in cyber sex with 
paying clients. China's criminal law has no clear article on the 
punishment of naked chatting and online porn performances as the law 
had taken effect far before the illegal phenomena cropped up," said 
Jin Delu (a local lawyer in Guangzhou)." 
 
¶3. WTO 
 
"U.S. and Europe want to sue China in the WTO" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/24): "The U.S. Trade Representative 
announced at a press conference that the U.S. will join the EU in a 
suit against China at the WTO because China collects an export 
tariff and has an export quota on more than 20 kinds of raw 
materials.  Analysts indicate that it demonstrates the phenomenon of 
an intensified global trade competition.  Chinese experts said that 
it is totally unacceptable that the U.S. and EU have launched such a 
suit against China.  China has the right to manage the exports of 
limited resources.  In this way, the U.S. will never come down to 
the earth.  Many times when the U.S. and China conflict in the WTO, 
the U.S. only gains what it wants temporarily; later their gain 
turns out to be only a paper victory.  Suing China over limited 
strategic medals will start a chain reaction.  China could also 
countersue the U.S. on their many prohibitions against exploring oil 
reserves.  China's move to limit the export of these limited 
resources is environmentally beneficial.  This type of dispute will 
bring a negative influence to China's foreign trade."
