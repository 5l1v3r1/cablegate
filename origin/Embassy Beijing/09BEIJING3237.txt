SUBJECT: DECEMBER 3, 2009 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: CLIMATE CHANGE, 
CENTRAL ASIAN SECURITY, REPATRIATION ISSUES WITH CANADA 
 
¶1. Key points at the December 3 MFA press briefing were: 
 
-- China believes developing countries such as China and India do 
not have an "obligation" to binding initial carbon reduction 
targets. 
 
-- China hopes to cooperate and sustain the momentum on dialogue 
with the United States regarding Central Asian security. 
 
-- While China maintains that Lai Changxing should be repatriated 
from Canada, China will not grant consular access to Hussein Celil, 
a Canadian citizen of Chinese Uighur descent currently detained in 
China. 
 
No "Obligation" on Climate Change 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  At the December 3 regularly scheduled Foreign Ministry press 
briefing, Spokesperson Qin Gang  briefed on China's objectives for 
the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen.  Qin noted 
that China advocated adherence to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), Kyoto Protocol, and the Bali 
roadmap.  The UNFCC principle of "common but differentiated 
responsibilities" should be observed in order to reach consensus. 
Qin noted that developed countries should establish a reduction plan 
including financial support and technology transfers to developing 
countries for sustainable development. 
 
¶3.  Qin also stated that developing countries, such as China and 
India, were victims of climate change and, as such, did not have an 
obligation to binding initial carbon reduction targets.  Qin claimed 
that China and India, in particular, held similar positions, 
concerns, and demands.  Qin stated that developed countries should 
first demonstrate "substantial" carbon reduction. 
 
Cooperation in Central Asia 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4. China hoped the international community would contribute to 
establishing peace and stability in Central Asia while fully 
respecting those countries' independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity, said Qin.  When asked to comment on President 
Obama's announcement of a troop surge in Afghanistan, Qin responded 
that China hoped to sustain the momentum of the dialogue with the 
United States on these regional issues.  The U.S.-China Joint 
Statement issued during President Obama's November 2009 visit 
highlighted related efforts by both sides to establish peace and 
stability in Afghanistan, he concluded. 
 
Measured Stance against Iran's Nuclear Program 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5. Qin emphasized that China's support for a resolution of the Iran 
nuclear issue through dialogue and negotiation rather than sanctions 
did not contradict China's vote in favor of the resolution passed by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) calling Iran to 
clarify all outstanding issues involving its nuclear program.  Qin 
asserted that China supported non-proliferation efforts, as well as 
building peace and stability in the Middle East. 
 
Repatriation Issues with Canada 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6. When asked to comment on outstanding repatriation issues between 
China and Canada, Qin stated that Lai Changxing, a Chinese citizen 
who has been in Canada since 1999, was a criminal and should be 
repatriated by the Canadian government.  Asked whether or not China 
would grant Canada consular access to Hussein Celil, a Canadian 
citizen of Chinese Uighur descent, Qin responded that Celil was 
Chinese and a member of the East Turkestan Independence Movement. 
The UN had declared the East Turkestan Independence Movement a 
terrorist organization and the Chinese government would handle 
Celil's case as an internal affair, Qin declared. 
 
4th China-Russia Strategic Security Consultation 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶7. Qin announced that the fourth session of the China-Russia 
Strategic Security Consultations would be held December 7 between 
Dai Bingguo and Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolay 
Petrushev.
