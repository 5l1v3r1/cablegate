U.S.-CHINA CLEAN ENERGY ROUNDTABLE IN BEIJING 
 
REFTEL:  A: BEIJING 3180 
         B: BEIJING 2865 
 
Summary 
------- 
¶1.   (U) In an effort to promote clean energy cooperation during the 
U.S. President's first visit to Beijing, U.S. Energy Secretary 
Steven Chu and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke led a senior-level 
U.S.-China roundtable discussion on clean energy on November 16. 
The roundtable included distinguished panelists from both countries' 
government, business, NGO, and academic sectors, and was co-chaired 
by China's National Energy Administration (NEA) Deputy Administrator 
LIU Qi and attended by China's Minister of Science and Technology 
WAN Gang. Senior U.S. and Chinese government officials echoed a 
common theme: both countries must leverage each other's strengths 
and pool resources to meet the difficult challenges associated with 
clean energy development. CEOs from several leading U.S. and Chinese 
energy firms, such as First Solar, Peabody, Suntech, BYD, and ENN, 
asked government leaders to avoid protectionist measures that could 
potentially impede clean energy technology trade and suggested that 
Beijing and Washington coordinate on favorable policy incentives 
that would stimulate speedier clean energy technology development. 
NGO representatives from the National Resources Defense Council 
(NRDC) and the World Resources Institute (WRI) focused on 
harmonizing energy efficiency standards and improving the 
R&D-to-commercialization cycle. END SUMMARY. 
 
GOVERNMENT LEADERS STRESS LEVERAGING TALENT 
------------------------------------------- 
¶2.  (SBU) China's Liu Qi kicked off the discussion by laying out 
NEA's priorities for clean energy development. Liu emphasized the 
need to step up efforts to develop a modern electrical grid, noting 
that new solar and wind power expected to come on-line in China over 
the next 10 years will require tremendous coordination between 
utilities and grid developers. Liu also said clean coal, carbon 
capture and sequestration (CCS), and electric vehicles are key 
development priorities for the Chinese government.  [NOTE: The 
priorities laid out by Liu at the clean energy roundtable are 
somewhat different from those he laid out earlier in the day at the 
joint U.S.-China Clean Energy Research Center steering committee 
meeting.  See REF A, Para 5 and 6 for a possible explanation of 
these discrepancies.  END NOTE.]  Minister Wan noted similar 
priorities for the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST).  Wan 
also highlighted the success of the U.S.-China Electric Vehicle 
Forum (see REF B) recently held in Beijing, and said that MOST 
planned to make this an annual event. Finally Wan said his dream is 
to "leave fossil fuel behind," but emphasized that only by sharing 
expertise will the U.S. and China be able to achieve this goal. 
 
¶3.  (U) Noting that the U.S. and China are the two largest users of 
energy, Secretary Locke stressed the special responsibility that 
both countries have to develop clean energy technologies that will 
 
BEIJING 00003182  002 OF 005 
 
 
sustain economic growth and combat global climate change.  He said 
China's agreement to remove localization requirements for wind 
turbines at the recent U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and 
Trade (JCCT) meeting was a step in the right direction, and it is 
only through leveraging each other's technical talents that the 
United States and China can develop the clean energy technologies 
the world wants and needs. The Secretary also noted his plan to lead 
an energy trade mission to China next May, which would include 
several large U.S. clean energy firms.  Secretary Chu expressed 
optimism about the direction U.S.-China clean energy collaboration 
is heading, but echoed the need to pool resources of each country in 
order to make faster progress as the effects of climate change 
loom. 
 
BUSINESS LEADERS "RETOOLING THE ENERGY INDUSTRY" 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶4.  (U) Business leaders from a wide array of clean energy ventures, 
including solar, wind, and electric vehicle production, detailed 
their firms' efforts to meet technology challenges. Bruce Sohn, the 
president of U.S. solar energy giant First Solar, said that the 
energy industry world-wide is undergoing a massive "retooling" and 
that public policy changes will be required to accommodate new 
energy technologies. Sohn also noted that these policy challenges 
are nearly as difficult as the technological challenges and will 
require close policy coordination between the United States and 
China at the state, provincial, county, and city government levels. 
During their presentations, several Chinese and American CEOs 
expressed a similar desire that both governments coordinate closely 
to develop policies that will ensure continued growth in the clean 
energy sector through incentives and common standards. 
 
¶5.  (U) U.S. and Chinese business leaders, including Neil Auerbach, 
former head of Goldman Sachs alternative energy investment unit, and 
Xie Xiaonan, vice president of China's solar powerhouse firm Suntech 
Power, also noted that discriminatory trade barriers will impede the 
best technologies from getting to market, and urged government 
leaders to devise policies that enhance IPR protection, while 
promoting free technology trade. Auerbach proposed building on the 
roundtable by holding a follow-on tradeshow sponsored by both 
governments that will bring thousands of clean technology 
entrepreneurs together. 
 
NGOS, ACADEMIA FOCUS ON STANDARDS AND COMMERCIALIZATION 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
¶6.  (U) China and the U.S. are at a key moment where both countries 
have the opportunity to transform clean energy aspirations into 
reality, according to Ken Lieberthal of the Brookings Institute. He 
said that the U.S. and China must develop compatible standards, 
regulations, common databases, and basic software sharing, which 
will ultimately drive down costs and speed commercialization of 
clean energy technologies. Michael Eckhart, president of the 
American Council on Renewable Energy, and Deborah Seligsohn of the 
 
BEIJING 00003182  003 OF 005 
 
 
World Resources Institute, expressed similar sentiments, 
highlighting joint venturing as a key means of transferring 
technology, protecting IPR, and accelerating technology 
commercialization.
