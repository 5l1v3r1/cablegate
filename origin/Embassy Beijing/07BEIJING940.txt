Six-Party Talks 
--------------- 
 
¶2.  At the regularly scheduled February 8 MFA press 
briefing, Deputy Spokesperson Jiang Yu announced that 
the third round of Six-Party Talks resumed February 8 
with an opening ceremony at 4:20 p.m. followed by a 
plenary session and various bilateral, trilateral and 
heads of delegation meetings.  The duration of this 
round of talks depends on progress made.  Goals are to 
implement the Joint Statement, set specific measures 
parties will take in the initial phase, and establish 
a mechanism for further progress.  China hopes 
relevant parties will maintain pragmatic attitudes to 
address common concerns.  The issue of establishing 
working groups will be explored.  EVFM Dai is meeting 
with his DPRK counterpart.  Yesterday VFM Wu met with 
delegation heads from Russia, Japan, the United States 
and the DPRK. 
 
¶3.  When asked about abductions, financial sanctions 
and the anti-satellite test, Jiang said the Japan 
kidnapping issue can be addressed bilaterally within 
and beyond the framework of the Talks.  China hopes 
relevant parties take steps to address the financial 
sanctions favorable to progress in the Talks.  Jiang 
said the anti-satellite test is not related to the 
Talks; China's position is clear and the test does not 
pose a threat to other countries. 
 
¶4.  Asked if the United States and the DPRK signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding on financial sanctions in 
Berlin and if Hill would brief VFM Wu about it, Jiang 
would only say China hoped discussions between parties 
would support the foundation of the Talks.  When asked 
to comment on the statements by Teng Jianqun, headof 
China Arms Control and Disarmament Associaton, that 
the Talks will not be successful unless the United 
States lifts sanctions, Jiang replied this was only a 
scholar's personal view and hoped parties would 
overcome difficulties through compromise. 
 
Human Rights: Canadian-Uighur, AIDS Dr. Gao Yaojie 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5.  Jiang said detained Canadian-Uighur Husyincan 
Celil (Yu Xiangjiang) is a Chinese citizen and Candian 
diplomats have no right to attend his trial on 
terrorism charges.  Celil is a member of the East 
Turkistan Independence Movement, Jiang said, and 
authorities are dealing with his case in accordance 
with Chinese law.  Consular agreements between China 
and Canada do not apply, she said. 
 
¶6.  Jiang said MFA had no information about the 
reported house arrest of AIDS activist Dr. Gao Yaojie. 
 
Chinese Survey Activities Near Diaoyu Islands 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  A Japanese reporter asked about China's 
interpretation of the advance notice mechanism between 
China and Japan relating to the East China Sea and 
whether the recent dispute regarding survey vessels 
would be discussed at the upcoming meeting of the two 
countries' foreign ministers.  Jiang said the 
mechanism proceeds from general interests, aims to 
increase mutual trust and does not affect China's 
 
BEIJING 00000940  002 OF 002 
 
 
position on maritime law.  Recent maritime survey 
activity by China near the Diaoyu Islands is normal 
and within China's sovereign right. 
 
Africa Command 
-------------- 
 
¶8.  Jiang had no direct comment in response to 
questions about whether the United States' 
establishment of a unified Africa command was a 
response to Chinese activity in Africa.  Jiang said 
China-Africa cooperation benefits peace and 
development, goals which all parties active in the 
region should support.
