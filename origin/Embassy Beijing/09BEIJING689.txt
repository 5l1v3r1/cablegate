  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. TIBET 
 
"Misrepresenting Tibet a disingenuous strategy" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (03/17): "More 
and more young Chinese people have paid attention to the vast and 
sacred land of Tibet. Unblocked access to the Internet, television 
and newspaper coverage about the autonomous region has helped these 
open minded young people see that the West has long played an 
important force behind the Dalai Lama clique's activities. [Later in 
the article] By the end of February 2008, China had surpassed the 
U.S. and become the world's largest internet user. Thus, any talks 
about the Tibet issue should take their [Chinese netizens] opinions 
into full consideration. It is expected that any Western succor for 
the Dalai Lama will not only encounter opposition from the Chinese 
government, but will also run into resistance from the country's 
public opinion. Western strategists should acknowledge China's 
peaceful rise as a world power as irresistible and adapt to this 
geopolitical trend." 
 
¶2. SOUTH CHINA SEA DISPUTE 
 
"U.S. should stop their spying activities around China" 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated to the 
official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (03/17): "American 
military ships have come into the waters near Hainan Island, entered 
China's EEZ and closely approached China's mainland. Obviously, they 
had a military intention. The U.S. never stopped their spying 
activities against China. The South China dispute shows that the 
U.S. has not changed its stance on China in spite of the financial 
crisis or the economic cooperation and growth between the two 
countries. China should have a sober awareness of that fact. Of $2.3 
trillion foreign exchange assets that China is holding, about $1.7 
trillion are U.S.-dollar assets. China has played an important and 
supportive role for the U.S. economy and national strength. Between 
the U.S. and China, the U.S. military has done little concerning 
military, weapons and technological cooperation, in either quantity 
or quality, at a strategic level or an overall level. It is always 
what the U.S. asks from China, not on the contrary, what China asks 
from the U.S. Without China's strategic assistance, the U.S.' 
leading influence in the Asia-Pacific or even global affairs would 
be greatly reduced." 
 
¶3. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"Is U.S. credit worth trusting?" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(03/17): "Premier Wen Jiabao mentioned his 
apprehension concerning the falling price of American debts. This is 
a representation of the Chinese people's opinion. China has been 
continuously holding a lot of American debt for many years. This 
shows China's emphasis on the U.S. debt, however, the question is, 
are they secure? American debt has become the China's most important 
financial security issue. Premier Wen's concern is a reminder for 
the U.S. Some Americans believe China is been restricted by holding 
so many American debts. They therefore do not pay enough attention 
to China's stance on certain issues and pressure China on issues 
like the exchange rate, the South China Sea dispute and Tibet. 
Therefore, China's Premier publicly spoke about his doubts 
concerning the U.S.' national credit. American media indicates that 
China's small moves in purchasing American debts will likely trigger 
a series of consequences. American debts are not just a financial 
issue, but a credit issue. The U.S.' national credit will be broken 
once the American national debt market collapses. China has 
emphasized that harmony between the two countries will benefit both 
and any fights will only bring harm. The security of China's 
American debt is once again reflected as a characteristic of the 
U.S.-China relationship." 
 
¶4. U.S.-CHINA-JAPAN RELATIONS 
 
"Is the axis China, U.S. and Japan feasible?" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(03/17): "Japanese media reported that the U.S. 
has sent a clear diplomatic signal that the U.S. does not need the 
axis of U.S.-Japan, but of U.S.-Japan-China.  It has in fact 
announced the end of the U.S.-Japan axis era. The strength 
comparison of Japan and China has already changed. China has become 
the third largest economic country and the largest creditor country 
to the U.S. Since the financial crisis broke out, China's influence 
has further increased. The world's people have widely recognized the 
 
BEIJING 00000689  002 OF 002 
 
 
obvious improvement to China's comprehensive national strength. 
What's more, the U.S. is also adjusting its China policies. 
Secretary Clinton has emphasized that the U.S. is seeking a new type 
of partnership with newly-emerging countries and indicated that the 
U.S. and China should be pulled together in times of trouble. 
Furthermore, Japan's China policy is changing too. Japan should also 
promote China-Japan strategic partnership. A cooperative, win-win 
and equal partnership should be promoted for the trilateral 
relations of the U.S., Japan and China, but not 'two against one 
(U.S. and Japan against China). The relationship should not be 
referred to as the axis of the U.S., Japan and China because this 
name suggests that the axis will lead other countries."
