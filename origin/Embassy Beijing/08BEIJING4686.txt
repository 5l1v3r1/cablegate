¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a. "The U.S. report sets tones for U.S.-China trade" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/26): "On the day before Christmas, the 
U.S. issued a report on China's compliance with commitments it made 
since it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) seven years ago. 
This report sets the tone for trade between the U.S. and China. The 
Chinese Council on WTO-related issues has indicated that, in order 
to deal with the trade frictions recently made by the U.S. 
government, China should clearly understand and strictly follow the 
WTO standard regulations.  In the event that the U.S. causes more 
friction, then China will be able to reflect upon the WTO framework 
for guidance. Also, China may need to conduct an investigation 
concerning the subsidies that the U.S. Government gives to American 
companies. The U.S. Government always acts in double standards. The 
Councilor of the Chinese National Lawyer Association has said that 
'the anti-subsidy investigation by the U.S. on China has violated 
the international trade theory and regulations. The U.S. hasn't yet 
admitted to China's significant role in a market economy. This shows 
the influence on trade policy of the power politics in the U.S." 
 
b. "There are four possible future conflicts for U.S.-China 
relations" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/26): "Washington's decision makers have a 
common opinion; that the U.S. is unable to prevent China's 
resurgence. They also believe that they are unable to change China's 
political system and impose their values on China. They realize that 
China is not the enemy of the U.S. and that a wise China policy 
should ensure that the two countries do not step towards a 
confrontation. ...However, there are four possible future conflicts 
between China and the U.S. First, along with the modernization of 
the Chinese characteristics, the differences between the U.S. and 
China's developmental models will become more obvious. Second and 
third, the U.S.-China conflicts in eastern Asia will continue as 
well as, the rising influence of China in other areas such as in the 
Middle East, Latin America and Africa. And fourth, the U.S. will put 
a higher priority on energy, climate change, environmental 
protection and Washington will further pressure China on these 
issues." 
 
c. "Between the U.S., Russia, and Europe; who is the 'real friend' 
to China?" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (12/26): "The U.S. 
and China are seeking a balance in their dynamic relationship 
through a combination of cooperation and competition. After 
September 11th, the U.S. and China have continuously explored a 
strategic and converging point of agreement on topics such as the 
North Korean nuclear crisis and non-proliferation issues. Chinese 
experts indicate that the U.S. is not going to be able to solve any 
global issues without the cooperation of China, especially during 
the current financial crisis. However, currently Taiwan is a 
strategic pawn for the U.S... Chinese scholars believe that the U.S. 
and China are destined to have conflicts of interest. It is not 
necessary for the U.S. and China to lay out their strategic bottom 
lines because the U.S.-led international system has provided China 
an environment for peaceful development. Besides, China doesn't have 
any intention to compete for world hegemony with the U.S." 
 
¶2. SOMALIA 
 
"Chinese fleets set off for the Somali coast" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/26): "A Chinese fleet has left for 
Somalia. Globally, this act has largely been connected with a new 
understanding of China's rising power.  Chinese experts relate that 
China has made an important first step for its Navy.  The Chinese 
Navy doesn't have its own navy base on the way to Somalia. 
Therefore it must depend on its own supply ships.  China's oceanic 
operation has received far less recognition from the world than most 
navy powers. What's more, China is not very experienced in the 
dealings taking place in the 'public' or 'open waters' of the 
oceans. This is, obviously, not an easy task for the Chinese Navy. 
The operation will give the World a chance to evaluate the Chinese 
Navy. Thus the operation has received wide attention from the 
World's media and navies. As a German expert indicated; as a new 
guest in the global navy, China's goal is not driving others away, 
but to take a seat at a large table."
