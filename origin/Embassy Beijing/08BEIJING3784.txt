¶1. (SBU) Summary: On September 21, China sacked General 
Administration on Quality, Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine 
(AQSIQ) Minister Li Changjiang in the aftermath of China's biggest 
ever food and product safety scandal, the widespread contamination of 
milk products with the industrial chemical melanine, which sickened 
more than 50,000 children and killed four.  China rapidly identified 
a successor, State Council Deputy Secretary General Wang Yong, who 
has recent experience in anti-corruption and the placement of 
corporate executives at state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and whose 
background is in the aerospace industry.  The State Council held a 
planning meeting September 17 and is preparing a post-crisis action 
plan.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Party mouthpiece China Daily highlighted the anti-corruption 
credentials of Li's replacement, who had joined the State Council in 
early 2008. From 2003 to 2007, Wang was a Director in the Central 
Party Committee (CPC) and a member of the CPC's Central Commission 
for Discipline Inspection, which plays a key role in rooting out 
corruption.  Wang concurrently served as the Vice Chairman and Deputy 
Party Secretary of China's State-Owned Assets Supervision and 
Administration Commission (SASAC).  In this capacity, he led SASAC's 
First and Second Bureaus, which manage a pool of bureaucrats and 
party members detailed to the SOEs that SASAC administers and also 
approves the nomination of other SOE executives.  In this capacity, 
Wang likely gained experience in corporate oversight.  Prior to that, 
most of Wang's career has been spent in the aerospace industry. 
Contacts at SASAC declined to comment on Wang's tenure and provided 
the Embassy his official biography, below. 
 
¶3. (U) The following is Wang Yong's biography from SASAC:

Province in 1955. He started his working career from August 1969 and 
joined the CPC in August 1974. Wang is a university postgraduate.  He

Deputy Party Secretary of Beijing area of the China Aerospace 
Corporation. In April 1998, he was in charge of the Personnel, Labor 
and Education Bureau of the China Aerospace Corporation. In June 
1999, he was designated as Vice President and member of the Party 
committee of the China Aerospace Mechanical and Electrical Products 
Corporation. In November 2000, he was appointed as Director-General 
of the Office for Top Executives of Enterprises of the Ministry of 
Organization, CCCPC. Later in April 2001, he held the post of
