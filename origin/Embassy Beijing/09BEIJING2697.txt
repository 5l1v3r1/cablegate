  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"The U.S. and China should be more active in managing bilateral 
crises" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/21)(pg 14): "The recent meeting between 
U.S. officials and the Dalai Lama and the U.S. special protection 
case on tires have shown that crisis prevention and management 
mechanisms are as important as bilateral dialogue mechanisms. 
Transparency is crucial in crisis prevention, as is informing the 
other country about what is and what is not acceptable.  The U.S. 
has clearly outlined its national security strategy, which ensures 
that its national interests are not violated when dealing with other 
countries.  It is not a bad thing for a country to demonstrate to 
others its toughness and unwillingness to make compromises. 
Measures to take revenge should also be considered to ensure the 
crisis management and prevention mechanisms mentioned above remain 
operative.  Taking prompt revenge is necessary not only in the 
diplomatic and military fields, but also in the economic field.  Not 
taking revenge sometimes means paying an even greater price in the 
future.  Constructive criticism is another important part of crisis 
prevention.  Giving the country that has made a mistake a chance to 
correct itself will ensure continued cooperation.  This is China's 
attitude in the tire case." 
 
"How should one view the various 'faces' of the United States?" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (09/21)(pg 10): 
"The U.S. has 'changed its face' towards China very rapidly: from 
discussing at a very high level the possibility of a 'G2' to 
imposing punitive tariffs on Chinese tire imports and naming China 
as the main challenger in its National Intelligence Strategy (NIS) 
report.  In reality, the U.S. just stated what it has always 
believed.  The U.S. issued the NIS report for the following reasons: 
first, because it is required by Congress and necessary for the 
intelligence budget; second, the intelligence community needs an 
alleged enemy, the bigger the better; and third, although China has 
no intention of threatening the United States, it is true that China 
has the ability to 'launch intelligence operations against the U.S.' 
 These various 'faces' reflect the U.S.'s fundamental interests: on 
one level, the U.S. needs China; but, on a more fundamental level, 
the U.S. maintains a high degree of vigilance against China.  China 
should deal with the U.S.'s changing faces in a calm way." 
 
¶2.  G20 SUMMIT 
 
"What would Obama like to discuss at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh?" 
 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(09/21)(pg A4): "Obama will face 
pressure from developing countries at the G20 summit.  Obama's 
tariffs on Chinese tires will undoubtedly be a source of 
embarrassment at the meeting between Obama and Hu Jintao.  Obama is 
expected to make a commitment to Chinese leaders at the summit to 
alleviate tensions between China and the U.S. caused by the tire 
case, and at the same time focus on more positive aspects of the 
bilateral relationship.  Obama will also face a 'crisis of trust' at 
the summit due to the tire case.  G20 countries all expect the U.S. 
to play the leading role in fighting against protectionism; however, 
if the U.S. adopts protectionist measures, other countries will 
follow suit and the situation will spin out of control.  Some 
predict Obama will strongly support bolstering China's position at 
the International Monetary Fund."
