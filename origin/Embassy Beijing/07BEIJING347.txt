SUBJECT:  SECRETARY OF ENERGY BODMAN'S MEETING WITH 
CHAIRMAN SUN QIN OF THE CHINA ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY 
 
BEIJING 00000347  001.3 OF 003 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary. Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman 
discussed the Global Nuclear Energy Program (GNEP), 
Generation IV International Forum (GIF), ongoing 
cooperation under the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Technology 
(PUNT) and potential areas for new cooperation with China 
Atomic Energy Authority (CAEA) Chairman Sun Qin after the 
Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) December 15.  Chairman 
Sun said that China would have much to contribute to GNEP, 
but needs to learn more about the program and is willing to 
engage in a private dialogue to do so.  The Ministry of 
Science and Technology (MOST), which signed the GIF 
agreement, is considering full cooperation in GIF, Chairman 
Sun said.  Chairman Sun expressed interest in enhancing 
China's nuclear security efforts before the 2008 Olympics, 
and continuing enhancing nuclear safety and security as 
China launches its ambitious nuclear power program. 
Finally, Chairman Sun said that China is interested in 
increasing cooperation in nuclear energy development, 
because he is concerned that China lacks adequate human 
resources for future development needs.  End Summary. 
 
 
U.S. - China Nuclear Cooperation on Solid Footing 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During a December 15, 2006 meeting with CAEA 
Chairman Sun Qin, DOE Secretary Bodman expressed 
satisfaction with the length and quality of nuclear 
cooperation with China during more than two decades of 
formal cooperation.  Chairman SUN highlighted the history 
of the cooperation, beginning in 1985, when the United 
States and China established the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear 
Energy Agreement (PUNE) to the present, when the 
cooperation is based on the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear 
Technology (PUNT) agreement, signed in 1998.  Exchanges 
between the two countries have continued to diversify, 
Chairman SUN added.  Beginning with the October 2005 Joint 
China - U.S. Integrated Nuclear Materials Management 
Technology Demonstration at the China Institute of Atomic 
Energy (CIAE), Chairman SUN continued, the two sides are 
participating in expanded areas of cooperation in nuclear 
technology, materials safeguards and security, waste 
disposal, and new cooperation on radiological sources 
security. 
 
China Considering GNEP but Concerned about Risk 
---------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Secretary Bodman expressed his view that China 
has a lot to contribute to GNEP's development, and hoped 
that China's decision to join the partnership would be 
forthcoming in the near future.  Chairman SUN stated that 
China attaches great importance to the GNEP concept, but 
still needs to have a better understanding of its 
organization.  SUN also acknowledged that GNEP's long-term 
purpose is to strengthen non-proliferation while developing 
nuclear energy, and noted that the United States devotes 
much effort to promote nonproliferation throughout the 
world.  Nevertheless, China requires additional clarity on 
the program. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Chairman SUN wanted to know whether there are 
risks in going from a theoretical fuel cycle concept 
technology into an engineering design and construction 
project.  Secretary Bodman acknowledged that because GNEP 
is still in the research phase there will be risks.  That 
is true of any research program, Secretary Bodman 
continued.  However, it is important to know what the risks 
are, and pay attention to them.  GNEP has three stages, the 
second of which is the research stage, taking place between 
the years 2008 to 2023, or providing more than 12 years to 
settle the technical issues, the Secretary asserted, 
reaffirming his belief that the risks will be resolved in 
that time frame. 
 
Other China GNEP Concerns 
 
BEIJING 00000347  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Chairman Sun also wants to acquire further 
details on how the policy of returning reprocessed spent 
fuel to the country of origin would work, how would the 
added value derived from the production of plutonium fuel 
in the irradiated fuel be accounted for, and on the 
relationship between GNEP and other nonproliferation 
mechanisms, such as the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
(NPT), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), the IAEA Project 
on Next Generation Reactors (INPRO)  and the U.S. GIF 
initiative. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) According to SUN, China is also concerned about 
GNEP's effect on the development of China's own nuclear 
industry, should it choose to become a GNEP partner.  SUN 
indicated that China is willing to engage in a private 
dialogue in order to get a better understanding of GNEP and 
to discuss these matters with other countries to learn of 
their understanding of the program.  He twice stated that 
China has a constructive attitude toward the project. 
 
GNEP's Immediate Challenge Is To Design an International 
Cooperative Framework 
-------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Devising the cooperative framework will require 
devoting a lot of effort to politics, diplomatic 
initiatives, and consideration of the national interests of 
countries that would participate in the program, Secretary 
Bodman noted. 
 
China Signals Desire for Olympic Cooperation under PUNT 
------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Secretary Bodman and Chairman Sun affirmed their 
satisfaction with progress made under the PUNT agreement, 
with a working group meeting scheduled in Beijing early in 
2007, a Chinese nuclear emergency delegation going to the 
U.S. at the end of January, and new cooperation on 
radiological source security being organized under the 
PUNT. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Noting that China is host to the 2008 Summer 
Olympic Games, Chairman SUN voiced the need to strengthen 
nuclear security efforts for the games, given the limited 
time left before the games begin.  Assistant Secretary 
Harbert responded that DOE is ready to work on a pilot 
project on radiological sources security that can be in 
place in time for the Olympics. 
 
Other Cooperative Activities with the United States 
---------------------------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Furthermore, Chairman SUN indicated concern over 
the need to continue enhancing nuclear safety and security 
as China launches its ambitious nuclear power program.  He 
signaled willingness for additional cooperation in the 
areas of nuclear safety, safeguards, security, waste 
disposal, and nuclear emergency response, each an agenda 
item under the PUNT Joint Coordinating Committee. 
 
Cooperation on Expanding Nuclear Power Development 
------------------------ 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Finally, Chairman SUN made a bid for additional 
cooperation in the nuclear energy development field, 
stating that China's research and development facilities 
are weak.  China seeks cooperation with the United States 
in every aspect, SUN stated.  Secretary Bodman disagreed 
with the characterization of China's capabilities, 
affirming his belief that China's great advantage is its 
engineering talent.  Chairman SUN countered that given the 
enormity of the challenge, China does not possess 
sufficient human resources to satisfy future development 
needs.  China is open to cooperation with other countries 
 
BEIJING 00000347  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
on nuclear energy and nuclear technology applications. 
Although Tsinghua University's high temperature gas cooled 
pebble bed reactor is a technical advantage, it is not a 
mature technology, he stated.  Similarly, he added, the 
CIAE Fast Reactor, now under construction, will not reach 
criticality until 2009. 
 
Full Participation in GIF 
------------------------- 
 
¶12.  (SBU) Assistant Secretary Karen Harbert observed that 
DOE is happy to sponsor China's membership in GIF, and she 
encouraged China to take all steps to participate fully in 
GIF.  She stated that there were approximately 60 technical 
meetings last year under GIF, and she noted that the 
program provided an opportunity for additional cooperation 
on nuclear issues.  The Ministry of Science and Technology 
(MOST) signed the GIF agreement, and is considering full 
participation, Chairman SUN replied.  China, he continued, 
will be able to benefit from the technology exchanges, but 
will also make contributions of its own, for example on 
high temperature gas cooled reactor research. 
 
China's Participation in IAEA Antiterrorism Programs 
------------------------ 
 
¶13.  (SBU) Chairman Sun also highlighted the attention and 
great interest that China pays to combat nuclear 
antiterrorism and its increasing cooperative activities on 
the subject with the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA).  China is ready to participate in the IAEA Nuclear 
Security Network Laboratory and will participate in the 
IAEA's non-proliferation supporting program, SUN declared. 
(Note: DOE is providing technical assistance with the 
Security Network Laboratory.)
