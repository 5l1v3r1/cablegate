TAIWAN, VIETNAM DEMONSTRATION, JAPAN, DALAI LAMA 
 
¶1. Key points at the regular December 11 MFA Press 
Briefing: 
 
--Sinopec's Iran deal is a "business action" conducted 
on bases of equality and mutual benefit.  The Chinese 
government does not need to comment on such a 
commercial deal. 
 
--Chen Shui-bian's UN referendum "seriously threatens 
peace and stability across the Straits."  Stopping the 
referendum serves the common interests of the United 
States and China. 
 
--Anti-China demonstrations in Vietnam have undermined 
friendly ties.  China hopes to solve disputes over the 
South China Sea through dialogue and negotiations. 
 
--China denies removing reference to Renminbi 
revaluation from its version of a joint statement 
released December 1 at the close of the China-Japan 
High-Level Economic Dialogue. 
 
Sinopec Iran Investment 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. A Reuters journalist asked Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Qin Gang to comment on Sinopec's recently 
announced investment in Iran's Yadavaran oil field and 
on State Department statements of concern.  Qin 
characterized the deal as "business conducted by a 
Chinese company on the basis of equality and mutual 
benefit with Iran."  The Chinese government does not 
need to comment on such a "business action." 
 
DAS Christensen Comments on Taiwan Referendum 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. Asked about EAP DAS Thomas Christensen's recent 
remarks to Taiwan journalists, Qin said Chen Shui-bian 
is disregarding the one-China principle by 
"obstinately pushing forward his separatist 
activities."  The UN membership referendum "seriously 
threatens peace and stability across the Straits." 
Preventing the referendum, Qin said, will be 
"conducive" to stability and "serves the common 
interests" of China and the United States. 
 
South China Sea, Vietnam Demonstrations 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Referring to December 9 demonstrations in Vietnam 
opposing China's claims in the South China Sea, Qin 
said China has "indisputable sovereignty" over these 
waters.  China is aware of Vietnam's claims and 
leaders from the two sides have exchanged views on the 
issue.  China wants to solve the dispute through 
dialogue and negotiation to maintain stability in the 
South China Sea and in the interests of bilateral 
relations.  "Some developments" in Vietnam undermine 
friendly relations and China is "deeply concerned." 
China hopes that the Vietnamese Government will take a 
"responsible attitude and adopt effective measures" to 
prevent the "undermining" of bilateral relations. 
 
Wang Yi to Pakistan, No Comment on Nuclear Coop 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5. Qin confirmed that Vice Foreign Minister and 
Special Envoy Wang Yi will visit Pakistan starting 
December 11.  Wang will meet with President Musharraf 
and leaders of Pakistan's caretaker government.  Asked 
about reports China intends to provide additional 
nuclear power plants to Pakistan, Qin said he has not 
heard of any such reports. 
 
China-Japan Joint Statement Discrepancy 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Several Japanese journalists asked Qin to comment 
on accusations China unilaterally deleted reference to 
 
BEIJING 00007449  002 OF 003 
 
 
Renminbi revaluation from the China-Jpan joint 
statement.  The statement was issued after completion 
of the December 1 China-Japan High-Level Economic 
Dialogue.  Qin denied the statement was a "joint 
document" saying each side released its own version 
and it was "natural" that there would be some 
differences.  He called upon Japan's media to handle 
the matter in a "calm and prudent" way.  Qin denied 
the discrepancies in the Chinese version of the joint 
statement went against normal international practice. 
China's position on Renminbi revaluation was made 
clear by Vice Premier Zeng Peiyan during Zeng's 
keynote address at the Dialogue. 
 
Visit of Japan PM 
----------------- 
 
¶7. Asked whether the visit to China by Japanese Prime 
Minister Yasuo Fukuda may be delayed due to ongoing 
controversy in Japan over anti-terror legislation, Qin 
said Fukuda expressed to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao 
during their Sydney meeting his desire to visit China 
by the end of 2007 or in early 2008.  China welcomes 
Fukuda's visit anytime that is convenient for the 
Japanese side. 
 
Nanjing Massacre Death Toll 
--------------------------- 
 
¶8. A Japanese reporter commented that a Chinese museum 
dedicated to the Nanjing massacre quotes a death toll 
of 300,000 and that scholars in Japan disagree with 
that figure.  Qin stated the 300,000 death toll is a 
historical figure and reflects the real history of 
Japan's aggression in China. 
 
Tibet: Dalai Lama Wants to Restore Serfdom 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶9. A journalist asked Qin to comment on a report 
released December 10 by the Tibetan government-in- 
exile blaming China for the erosion of Tibetan culture 
and economic degradation.  Qin said he would not 
comment because the Tibetan government-in-exile "has 
said so many lies."  The "Dalai Lama clique" continues 
to try to separate Tibet from China.  Social and 
economic progress in Tibet is being made "day-by-day" 
and the only thing "damaged" is the "cruel and dark" 
system of serfdom that the Dalai Lama wants to 
restore. 
 
Six-Party Talks 
--------------- 
 
¶10. Qin confirmed that members of the Economic and 
Energy Working Groups will meet December 11-12 in 
Beijing.  The ROK is hosting the meetings to discuss 
economic and energy assistance to the DPRK.  Chinese 
Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei, Qin later added, will 
travel to Pyongyang next week for talks about the Six- 
Party process with DPRK Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye- 
gwan. 
 
Russian Presidential Election 
----------------------------- 
 
¶11. Asked for China's comment on Russian President 
Vladimir Putin's decision to endorse First Deputy 
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to be the next Russia 
president, Qin said the election was an internal 
affair.  Deputy Prime Minister Medvedev is a "good 
friend of the Chinese people" who has contributed to 
the development of Sino-Russian strategic relations. 
China particularly appreciates Medvedev's involvement 
in organizing the "Year of China in Russia" program, Qin 
said. 
 
EU-Africa Summit 
---------------- 
 
 
BEIJING 00007449  003 OF 003 
 
 
¶12. China welcomes the successful completion of the 
EU-Africa summit, Qin said.  China has common 
interests with the international community, including 
the EU, to promote peace, stability and development in 
Africa. 
 
Hollywood Movie Ban 
------------------- 
 
¶13. Qin claimed no knowledge of reports that China 
would ban Hollywood films for several months starting 
in January 2008.
