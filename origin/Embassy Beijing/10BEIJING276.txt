TRAFFICKING STATISTICS MODEL 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a meeting with Embassy Beijing on January 29, 
Chen Shiqu, Director of the Ministry of Public Security 
(MPS)Office of Combating Human Trafficking requested 
assistance in updating the statistical models currently in 
use for deriving data on trafficking in China. Chen stated 
that the model used by the National Bureau of Statistics made 
it impossible to provide data other governments and 
international organizations needed to study and assess 
accurately human trafficking. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Chen acknowledged that not having a model consistent 
with international standards had created a problem when 
trying to share data with the Embassy onthe Chinese 
government's progress on human trafficking.  He told PolOffs 
that, with the release of the "National Plan of Action on 
Combating Trafficking in Women and Children Progress Report" 
in December 2009, MPS obligated itself to release an annual 
trafficking report for China and was looking to use a new 
statistical model for the data included in those reports. 
Chen asked whether the USG might be willing to provide 
examples of the types of statistics and methodology that 
would make the trafficking report more useful.
