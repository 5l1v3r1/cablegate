  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
a. "Human rights report decried" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (02/27): "China 
yesterday denounced U.S. criticism of its human rights record in an 
annual report, saying Washington should first put its own house in 
order. 'We urge the U.S. to examine its own human rights problems 
and not use human rights as an excuse or publish human rights 
reports in order to interfere with others' internal affairs,' a 
Foreign Ministry spokesperson said.  'During the 30 years of 
development and reform, we have seen a continuous development of the 
economy; religious freedom has been protected; and all of Chinas 
ethnic groups increasingly enjoy more and more freedoms and rights. 
The U.S. practice of throwing stones while living in a glass house 
is a testimony to the double standards and hypocrisy of the United 
States in dealing with human rights issues and has undermined its 
international image..' the [Chinese] report said." 
 
b. "U.S. wants to use the human rights report to poke China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/27): "The U.S issued its annual Human 
Rights Report criticizing China's human rights record once again. 
This is completely different from Secretary Clinton's emphasis on 
human rights during her visit.  Chinese experts believe that 
Secretary Clinton's attitude represents the current U.S. 
government's China policy.  The human rights issue is unlikely to be 
an overwhelming topic and that the U.S.-China policy will become 
more reasonable.  Chinese experts indicate that human rights issues 
have been a diplomatic issue for the U.S. since the country was 
founded.  It is a long-lasting issue between the U.S. and China. 
Secretary Clinton's visit has shown that the U.S. government knows 
how to deal with China now.  Currently the most important issue is 
economic and trade cooperation.  Thus Secretary Clinton's attitude 
will represent the U.S. attitude better than the Human Rights 
Report." 
 
¶2. GARY LOCKE 
 
"Gary Locke is 'optimistic news' for China" 
 
21 Century Business Herald (21 Shiji Jingji Baodao) under Guangdong 
21-Century Publishing Company Ltd. commented (02/27): "President 
Obama nominated Gary Locke as his Commerce Secretary.  This move is 
to reward the Chinese-Americans who voted for Obama during his 
campaign.  Second, Obama needs supporters of free trade, like Gary 
Locke, to show his support to multinationals.  This is the 
inevitable result of using free trade to balance the 'Buy America' 
protectionism.  From the Chinese prospective, his choice of a 
Chinese-American is very important for the more and more complicated 
Sino-U.S. trade relationship.  Gary Locke knows about China and he 
understands how the Chinese do things. This will help him achieve a 
win-win situation for both countries. Once approved, he may push 
China to continue to open up their markets. He also has experience 
with IPR issues. In the field of IPR, the future Commerce department 
may have a better coordination with China.  Locke believes that free 
trade improves people's lives by promoting democracy and justice." 
 
¶3. U.S.-CHINA MILITARY RELATIONS 
 
"Resumption of military exchanges a good step" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (02/27): "China 
has made a solemn commitment to the international community that it 
will by no means pursue military expansion and will consistently 
adhere to a path of peaceful development.  The country would not 
seek hegemony even if it becomes more powerful.  All these 
commitments have made China's peaceful military strategy crystal 
clear. Facing an increasing number of traditional and nontraditional 
security threats, all countries should strengthen cooperation, 
especially in the military field. China and the U.S. should pass on 
the recent zero-sum stereotype and push for a win-win result for a 
healthier and more stable bilateral relationship."
