¶1.  U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a. "Poll shows Americans both love and hate China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/05)(pg 3): "Experts said that the [Thomson 
Reuters/Ipsos] poll, which was conducted right before Obama's visit 
to China, against the backdrop of the global financial crisis, trade 
disputes, and U.S.-China cooperation, shows the complicated view 
Americans have of China.  Professor Wu Xinbo at Fudan University 
said that political elites in both countries should develop an 
accurate understanding of each other's strategic intentions, seek an 
objective point of view, and avoid exaggerating risks.  By 
recognizing China's growing influence, the U.S. has pays increasing 
emphasis to the bilateral relationship.  Meanwhile, the U.S. is wary 
of China because of the different political systems, ideologies and 
strategic interests.  Ni Feng, an American studies expert at the 
Chinese Academy of Social Science, mentioned that the opinion of a 
poll, in fact, barely reflects the deeply bound feelings and 
reciprocal relationship of the U.S. and China." 
 
b. "U.S. compets with China for friends" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(11/05)(pg 4): "The 
United States' diplomatic offensive in Asia is actually a battle 
with China for friends.  Obama, compared to previous U.S. 
administrations, has taken a smarter approach.  One can see the 
milder U.S. approach concerning its attitude toward the North Korean 
nuclear issue and in its relations with Burma.  The frequent 
diplomatic moves by the U.S. in Asia have shown the country's 
concern over China's growing influence in the region.  The signing 
of a peaceful treaty with ASEAN aims at preventing the emergence of 
any regional organization that might exclude the U.S.  How to deal 
with China's influence in Asia will be a challenge for Obama. 
Professor Shi Yinhong said that in any case, the U.S. and China will 
not directly confront each other but will only compete over their 
friends in Asia. This competition will be a competition of soft 
power the results of which will not be clear for 10 or 20 years." 
 
¶3. CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
"Immediate action required to address climate change" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(11/05)(pg 1): 
"Currently, China has progressed further than the U.S. concerning 
climate change policy.  China has shown a stronger determination in 
taking responsibilities or making practical decisions than the U.S. 
While scientists have unanimously urged developed countries to set 
up emission reduction targets at a range of 25%-40% less than their 
emissions in 1990, the American Clean Energy and Security Act, which 
is being reviewed by Congress, shows that the U.S. lacks sincerity 
in global cooperation.  The bill weakens the capacity of the U.S. in 
international negotiations with China, India and other countries. 
One year has passed and the world is still waiting.  Today, 
President Obama has become the greatest obstacle in the global 
combat against climate change.  President Obama needs to put his 
words into action and make the United States a true pioneer.  Now is 
the time for Obama to halt his clever but empty talk and take real 
action.  President Obama himself needs to send a strong message to 
the U.S. and the world that the U.S. is ready to make a real promise 
on emission reduction.  Such behavior will enable the U.S. to 
participate as a leader in climate change negotiations.  The U.S. 
should also put offering financial support to developing countries 
at the top of their agenda."
