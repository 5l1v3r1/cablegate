Six-Party Talks, IAEA, Long-Term Peace Mechanism 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. At the June 26 regular MFA press briefing, spokesman Qin 
Gang announced that the BDA issue has been resolved and 
thanked all parties for their constructive efforts, but gave 
reporters no information on when the Six-Party Talks would 
resume.  IAEA DDG Heinonen will brief Beijing on the IAEA 
trip to the DPRK upon its completion, said the spokesman. 
Asked for details of the denuclearization process in the 
DPRK, Qin replied only that all sides would implement the 
initial actions spelled out in the February 13 Joint 
Document.  The agenda and topics of FM Yang's upcoming trip 
to the DPRK are still under discussion.  The MFA has taken 
note of reports on a North Korean woman forcibly taken to 
Japan, said Qin in response to a reporter's question. 
 
¶3. Asked for comment on A/S Hill's proposals of a peace 
mechanism for the Korean Peninsula as well as a broader 
security dialogue for Northeast Asia, Qin responded that 
ideas for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and 
long-term regional peace and stability were set in the 2005 
Joint Statement and February 13 Joint Document to which all 
parties have commitments.  China holds an open attitude as 
long as relevant proposals are conducive to the peace and 
stability of the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia, Qin 
stated. 
 
Killings of UN Peacekeepers Condemned 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. China condemns the attacks on UN Peacekeepers in Lebanon 
on June 24 and offers its condolences, the spokesman 
announced at the beginning of the press briefing.  China 
hopes local authorities bring those responsible to justice 
and is ready to work with the international community to 
realize peace and stability in Lebanon at an early date. 
 
Calls for Peace on Turkey-Iraq Border 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. As a UNSC Permanent Member, China hopes that all countries 
respect Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity and 
resolve differences through peaceful means, said Qin 
responding to calls by Turkish media for China's position if 
military operations were carried out against the Kurdistan 
Workers Party (PKK) in northern Iraq.  Asked if China 
recognized the PKK as a terrorist organization and if 
discussions with Iraqi President Talabani included the 
potential operation, Qin said he did not know of the group 
and provided no details on the meetings.  China hopes 
factionalism and religious strife in Iraq can be overcome to 
allow for economic development and stability. 
 
Zoellick to Lead World Bank, Improve Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶6. China congratulates Robert Zoellick on his appointment as 
World Bank president, believes cooperation will move forward 
under his leadership and hopes the organization will abide by 
its institutional role and positively contribute to world 
development and poverty relief, Qin said when asked about the 
news.

9th East China Sea Consultations Ongoing 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. MFA DG for Asian Affairs Hu Zhengyue and Japan MFA DG for 
Asian and Oceanian Affairs Kenichiro Sasae are holding the 
9th China-Japan Consultations on the East China Sea in Tokyo 
today to exchange ideas on join development plans, Qin said 
when asked to comment by the Japanese press.  China hopes 
joint efforts can be made to demonstrate the important 
consensus reached by both sides in the consultation and 
realize a sea of friendship, cooperation and peace. 
 
Strengthen EU Cooperation 
------------------------- 
 
¶8. China's position on the EU arms embargo has not changed, 
Qin said when asked if it would be discussed at the upcoming 
EU-China Summit in November.  China hopes as Portugal ascends 
to the EU presidency, the new leadership can make a positive 
contribution to EU-China relations and further strengthen 
cooperation based on a cooperative strategic partnership in 
various fields. 
 
Kidnappings in Pakistan, Copper Strike in Chile 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶9. Chinese hostages taken in Pakistan all had legal business 
licenses and China always advises its citizens to abide by 
local laws when abroad, said Qin when asked if the seven 
Chinese massage parlor workers kidnapped were engaged in 
illegal sexual activity.  Asked if Chinese companies would 
negotiate with striking copper miners in Chile, Qin replied 
that he was not aware of the situation.
