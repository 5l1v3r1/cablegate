Â¶1. (SBU) The Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed on February 26 to 
Embassy Beijing the third avian influenza death in China in 2008. 
As reported in REF A, the Government of China had previously 
notified Embassy Beijing and Consulate Guangzhou of the suspected AI 
case, a 44-year-old female migrant worker that fell ill on February 
16 after exposure to sick and dead poultry.  On February 25, one day 
after MOH's initial notification, the woman died.  MOH reported that 
the laboratories at the China Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention confirmed that samples taken from the victim had tested 
positive for the avian influenza virus (A/H5N1). MOH also reported 
that eighty three persons that had prior close contact with the 
victim have been placed under medical observation.  None of the 
persons have exhibited any symptoms of the disease. MOH's 
notification did not have any information on whether poultry in the 
area had been culled.
