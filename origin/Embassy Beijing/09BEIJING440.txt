  Editorial Quotes

¶1. SECRETARY CLINTON'S VISIT 
 
"Secretary Clinton comes to China to talk" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/20): "Secretary Clinton will arrive in 
Beijing today. During her visit to Japan, Indonesia and South Korea, 
global media seems not to be focused on the trip, because they are 
waiting for her final and most important visit; her visit to China. 
This will be the first meeting of the Obama administration in 
Beijing. Some American politicians have prepared the secretary with 
a long list of requests, including human rights, weapons 
proliferations, and purchasing American debts. The U.S. is used to 
making demands of China, but the situation needs to change. The time 
for the U.S. to point the finger at China has passed. Secretary 
Clinton should remember to bring a notebook, in order to write down 
the requests of the Chinese. In this way, the two countries can 
understand each other and establish regulations and rules from an 
equal footing. Chinese intellectuals have realized the importance of 
grasping control over the agenda. On economics, China needs to ask 
the U.S. to suppress trade protectionism. China should also bring 
forward the request that the U.S. begin good national management, in 
view of the insufficient supervision that caused the financial 
crisis. In general the U.S.' pressure and influence on China is 
decreasing. The U.S. has become more polite in dealing with China. 
The U.S.-China economic relationship is the stabilizer in the 
bilateral relations." 
 
¶2. JAPAN 
 
"Feb. 17th Okinawa Treaty: U.S., from Okinawa to Guam" 
 
21 Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao) under Guangdong 
21 century publishing company Ltd. (02/20): "Hillary [Secretary 
Clinton] on behalf of America has signed the Okinawa International 
Treaty, which she is using as an example to prove that the alliance 
between the U.S. and Japan is still strong and vigorous. If American 
troops move from Okinawa to Guam, an island that is facing a problem 
of aged population, Guam will receive construction funds from the 
Defense Department as well as a huge group of young consumers. All 
of this is good news for the local economy's development. The 
tourism industry is the core industry in Guam, most of the tourists 
come from Japan, and therefore the Japanese attitude toward the U.S. 
is very clear; on the one hand, they make every effort to push away 
the Americans living in Japan, and on the other hand, they continue 
to travel to the U.S. to support the American economy. It seems that 
the Japanese think that these two things are irrelevant." 
 
¶3. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
"A letter to American political opportunists" 
 
21 Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao) under Guangdong 
21 century publishing company Ltd. (02/20): "Recently, the 
international media published an article saying that China is the 
source of the financial crisis, because they buy American debt. Now, 
some wizened Americans doubt China's responsibility in the financial 
crisis. In fact, the true nature of the financial crisis is a crisis 
of debts. As for responsibilities in this financial crisis, as the 
largest emerging economy, China is the first to begin to recover 
from the crisis, which is the biggest contributor to the recovery of 
the global economy. China is making efforts to provide the world 
with cheaper products. Detroit workers living comfortable lives will 
not be able to do this. For American economy to recover its economic 
development, the most important thing is not to criticize and 
threaten other countries, but to change their living standard and 
try to live a relatively balanced lifestyle." 
 
¶4. TIBET 
 
"West in the dark on Tibet, basic facts shed light" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (02/20): "The 
prevailing political opinion in the West on Tibet is so much based 
on simplistic conceptions...First and foremost, Tibet was never a 
political and social Shangri la before the peaceful liberation in 
1951...the social and political systems there were extremely 
medieval...largely through its half century of subversive activity 
and deceptive propaganda, the West's romanticism about Tibet emerged 
and then went on a rampage...hence, listening to and understanding 
China is critical for considering the complex issue of Tibet with 
sensibility, and for dealing with it both justly and 
realistically."
