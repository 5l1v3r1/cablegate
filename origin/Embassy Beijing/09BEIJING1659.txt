¶1. U.S.-CHINA MILITARY RELATIONS 
 
"U.S. and China need to regulate their behavior in the South China 
Sea" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (06/18): 
"Technically speaking, the 'intimate contact' between the U.S. 
destroyer's sonar and a Chinese submarine has posed a severe threat 
to the underwater travel of Chinese submarines.  To a certain extent 
it shows the increase in the frequency of activity by the U.S. and 
Chinese navy.  In recent years the U.S. and Chinese navies have only 
made a small step forward.  How to set up and improve communication 
and coordination and build trust on the sea within the international 
legal framework is still a long-term issue both countries need to 
face and resolve.  If the U.S. doesn't give up arms sales to Taiwan 
and besiegement strategy on China, the courtesy mutual military 
ship's visit and sea rescue drill will still have limited role in 
improving U.S.-China mutual trust and avoiding frictions.  As a 
powerful country outside the South China Sea region, to protect the 
regional peace and stability, the U.S. needs to abide by 
international law and China's law, ceasing illegal military 
exploration activities at China's water territory." 
 
¶2. BRIC SUMMIT 
 
"BRIC countries plan the new blueprint of the multilateral world" 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(06/18): "Although the meeting has not 
achieved the results people expected, it already directly challenged 
the traditional international order.  The joint statement issued 
after the meeting expressed the intention of the emerging economies 
to adjust the world pattern.  Another expert from the Chinese 
International Issues Research Foundation said the multilateral 
cooperation the U.S. is pursuing is not complete multilateralism, it 
is selective.  He also said the BRIC countries will have more say on 
pursuing the multilateral world.  Another expert from the Chinese 
Academy of Social Science said Obama has been forced by reality to 
adjust American diplomatic policy and the financial crisis will 
likely be a turning point.  A Chinese expert from Renmin University 
said that the four countries have two things in common: all are 
newly-emerging economies and all are big countries.  However, they 
also have great divergences in many aspects.  He also commented that 
as a new model of multilateral international order if the BRIC 
meeting can be held every year regularly undoubtedly it will 
increase the voice of BRIC countries in international negotiations. 
He thinks the BRIC meeting will be institutionalized but he does not 
think the BRIC countries will form an alliance." 
 
¶3. IRAN 
 
"Rarely seen chaos tests Iran's power" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/18): "Whether or not this rarely seen 
chaos can be finally pacified will become an important test of 
Iran's political system.  The collision of religion and democracy in 
Iran may even influence the whole Middle-East situation.  The Obama 
administration is wisely chosen to watch in a cautious manner 
because Obama knows clearly that once the U.S. steps in conflicts 
among Iranian parties will become a conflict between the pro and 
anti-U.S. camps.  Anti-U.S. sentiment will be aroused and will not 
be good for Iran's reform group.  Another Chinese expert also 
commented that the chaos is internal systematic chaos.  It will last 
and will not cause a new revolution.  Iran will not change 'color.' 
The election result shows that Iran's tough conservative leadership 
does not change.  The marginalized reform group has developed from 
dissatisfaction to indignation, causing chaos.  The chaos is also 
directly related to Ahmadinejad.  His four-years in office has 
caused social separation in Iran."
