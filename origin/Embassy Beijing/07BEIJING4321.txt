Cross-Strait "Common Market," Vincent Siew 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  At the June 27 regular TAO press briefing, spokesman Yang 
Yi said the Mainland advocates jointly exploring 
establishment of a cross-Strait economic cooperation 
mechanism and resumption of consultations on a "common 
market" based on the "1992 Consensus," in response to a 
question about Ma Ying-jeou's push for a cross-Strait common 
market.  In reply to a question on his views of Ma's Vice 
Presidential candidate, Yang said he has had no previous 
contact with Vincent Siew. 
 
Olympic Business Opportunities, Torch Relay Route 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3.  The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games 
(BOCOG) has been fair, open and transparent in working with 
enterprises as sponsors, partners and suppliers, Yang said in 
response to questions about Taiwan businesses reportedly 
believing the bar for participation is set too high. 
Taiwanese companies are included in the current 61 corporate 
sponsors of the Games, he added.  Regarding the current 
stalemate over the Olympic torch relay route, Yang said China 
hopes to remove "political interference" in implementing the 
consensus that previously had been reached by both sides, 
which had been approved by the International Olympic 
Committee. 
 
"Peaceful Independence, Democratic Reunification" 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4.  As long as there is hope for peaceful reunification, 
China will strive to develop cross-Strait relations, but will 
never tolerate Taiwan independence, Yang told reporters.  He 
was responding to a question about a new slogan, "peaceful 
independence, democratic reunification," reportedly 
circulating in Taiwan academic circles, as well as Taiwan 
scholar Huang Jiashu's view that the incompatibility of the 
Mainland and Taiwan's political and legal systems must be 
addressed. 
 
Success of "One Country, Two Systems" in Hong Kong 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5.  In response to questions on the tenth anniversary of Hong 
Kong's reversion to China, Yang called attention to the 
success of the "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people 
ruling Hong Kong," and "high degree of autonomy" concepts in 
Hong Kong over the past decade.  He expressed hope that 
increased understanding of the success of "one country, two 
systems" among Taiwan compatriots would promote the "peaceful 
reunification of the Motherland."  Yang also pointed out the 
ever-increasing exchange and trade between Hong Kong and 
Taiwan and encouraged the further development of Hong 
Kong-Taiwan relations. 
 
Cross-Strait Tourism, Charter Flights 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  The spokesman again blamed Taiwan for thwarting a deal on 
cross-Strait tourism on which he said civilian trade 
organizations from both sides had reached consensus after 
five rounds of technical consultations.  The first Dragon 
Boat Festival charter flights were completed successfully 
June 15-22, consisting of 21 round-trip flights, but Yang 
said China believes only with the early realization of 
weekend and normal charter flights will demand be met and 
real convenience provided to compatriots on both sides of the 
Strait.

Youth Exchange, Agriculture Cooperation 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  The spokesman gave a detailed description of exhibitions 
related to cross-Strait agriculture held in cooperation with 
the Taiwan Provincial Association of Agriculture on June 
20-25 in the cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Wuhan, 
Guangzhou and Dalian.  In reply to a question about a 
cross-Strait youth summer camp, Yang only mentioned a 
cooperative project among the China Reporters Association, 
the China Association of Journalists and Taiwan.
