A/S Hill to Visit DPRK 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. At the June 21 regular MFA press briefing, spokesman Qin 
Gang said the MFA is aware of A/S Hill's visit to the DPRK 
today, but gave no information about his agenda.  China hopes 
the visit will be conducive to the implementation of the 
Initial Actions Agreement and to the improvement of United 
States-DPRK relations.  The date for the next round of Six 
Party Talks is still under negotiation. 
 
¶3. FM Yang will visit the DPRK July 2-4 to discuss the Korean 
nuclear issue and other international issues of interest. 
Qin stated that "relevant MFA department heads" will 
accompany FM Yang and that the details of FM Yang's meetings 
are still being discussed with the DPRK.  FM Yang will visit 
Mongolia June 30-July 2 and Indonesia July 4-5 on the same 
trip. 
 
View Climate Change "Calmly and Objectively" 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Per capita emissions and the historical contributions of 
developed nations to global warming  should be considered, 
Qin said when asked about Dutch Government reports that 
China's carbon dioxide emissions have surpassed those of the 
United States.  Qin pointed out that the Netherlands' per 
capita emissions are three times those of China's and 
emphasized that much of the economic production that benefits 
developed nations has moved to developing nations like China, 
making it unfair to put excess  blame on China for climate 
change.  China takes a responsible attitude toward climate 
change and emissions reductions, looks forward to making 
joint efforts with the international community and hopes the 
international community can view the issue calmly and 
objectively. 
 
VFM Zhang to Attend Darfur Talks in Paris 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. VFM Zhang Yesui will attend the upcoming Darfur talks in 
Paris and elaborate on China's position in a comprehensive 
way, Qin said. 
 
Iraqi President Visit 
--------------------- 
 
¶6. Iraq President Talabani will attend a welcome ceremony 
hosted by President Hu then meet with PM Wen and NPC Chairman 
Wu Bangguo to exchange ideas on bilateral relations and 
issues of common interest, Qin replied when asked for details 
on the visit and any plans for new Chinese investments in 
Iraq.  China supports and participates in Iraq reconstruction 
and has provided 15 million RMB in aid, debt relief and 
training, Qin added. 
 
Military Spending "Not a Threat" 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶7. China follows the road of peaceful development and has a 
 
BEIJING 00004190  002 OF 002 
 
 
reasonable military budget to allow for territorial defense 
and the promotion of regional stability and common 
development, said Qin in response to criticism that increased 
military expenditures are turning China into a strategic 
threat to the United States.  China hopes stronger military 
exchanges will increase mutual trust. 
 
Japan Lacks Courage to Recognize History 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. Asked about reports that Japanese lawmakers are 
downplaying the "Nanjing Massacre" prior to that incident's 
seventieth anniversary, the spokesman said such reports 
expose Japan's lack of courage to recognize history and break 
with the past.  "Compelling evidence" supports the view that 
the Japanese military committed an "atrocious crime" in which 
Chinese died.  Qin criticized individuals in Japan for trying 
to erase history. 
 
Mekong River Cooperation Results "Tangible" 
------------------------------------------- 
 
China participates in regional cooperation around the Mekong 
River through a mechanism including Vietnam and other 
countries, said Qin commenting on reports about a new bridge 
and a direct land route connecting Bangkok and China. 
Discussions on future cooperation are ongoing in fields 
including transportation, information, environmental 
protection and resource utilization. 
 
"Sound Cooperation" with ILO 
---------------------------- 
 
¶9. China and the International Labor Organization (ILO) have 
sound cooperation, said Qin hen asked if international labor 
groups would be allowed to investigate a recent incident at a 
Shanxi brick factory.  Qin had no information on 
international groups investigating the incident and referred 
questions to proper authorities.  China attaches great 
importance to the incident and is taking measures to bring 
the perpetrators to justice, he added.
