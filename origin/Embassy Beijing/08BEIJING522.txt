¶1. Key points at the February 14, 2008 MFA Press Briefing were: 
 
-- China believes its joint proposal for a space weapons ban is in 
the interests of the international community. 
 
-- U.S. allegations of spying are "groundless" and China is "tired" 
of such "fabrications." 
 
-- China regrets Steven Spielberg's decision to withdraw as artistic 
advisor to the Beijing Olympics and China has made efforts to 
improve the situation in Darfur.

Gambari when he visits Beijing and China believes Burma has made 
significant steps towards democracy. 
 
Joint Proposal on Space Weapons Ban 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2. During the February 14 regular MFA press briefing, spokesperson 
Liu Jianchao announced the joint China-Russia proposal to ban 
weapons in space.  Liu said that the proposal was in the common 
interests of the international community and would safeguard the 
"peace and tranquility of outer space."  China hopes relevant 
countries will hold discussions on the proposal and "respond 
positively." 
 
U.S. Spying Allegations 
----------------------- 
 
¶3. Responding to repeated questions regarding recent U.S. arrests of 
alleged spies, Liu said that China had taken note of the reports and 
that the "so-called allegations are groundless."  The accusations 
result from the "Cold War mentality" of the United States and are 
not helpful for the bilateral relationship, continued Liu.  Liu said 
that China is "tired" of these "fabrications" and noted that similar 
accusations have been made in the past and have amounted to nothing. 
 China hopes that the United States will make efforts to improve 
relations. 
 
Spielberg's Resignation Regrettable 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Spokesman Liu responded to questions regarding Steven Spielberg's 
resignation as an artistic advisor to the 2008 Beijing Olympic 
Games.  The decision was regrettable, Liu said, noting that although 
Spielberg had accepted an invitation from the Beijing Organizing 
Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad (BOCOG), he had not 
signed an official contract. 
 
¶5. Liu said that attempts to link the situation in Darfur to the 
Olympics were not appropriate and that China is also concerned about 
the situation there.  Liu described a long list of actions which 
China has taken to improve the humanitarian crisis in Darfur 
including donating money, building power plants, digging wells and 
dispatching engineers.  Liu encouraged those worried about Darfur to 
abandon "empty rhetoric"and be objective and pragmatic. 
 
Olympic Athletes' Political Views 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶6. When asked repeatedly whether China would guarantee to treat all 
Olympic athletes equally regardless of whether they had expressed 
controversial political views, Liu would only say that China 
"welcomed all athletes with open arms."  China believes that the 
Olympics will be a "platform for the consolidation of friendship" 
and that athletes will be "friendly." 
 
WTO China Ruling 
----------------- 
 
¶7. When asked for China's comments on the recent WTO finding on 
China's auto industry, Liu referred reporters to the expert report 
delivered by the Ministry of Commerce.  China respects the WTO 
procedures for resolving disputes and has no comment while they are 
ongoing, said Liu. 
 
UN efforts in Burma 
--------------------- 
 
¶8. Liu confirmed that FM Yang Jiechi spoke with UN Secretary General 
Ban Ki-moon about Burma.  FM Yang and VFM Wang Yi will meet with UN 
envoy Ibrahim Gambari when he visits China.  China support's 
Gambari's efforts and believes Burma's government has taken steps in 
the right direction toward democratization.

------------------------------------------ 
 
¶9. When asked about continued concern in Japan over the recent 
discovery of tainted dumplings imported from China, Liu said that 
China immediately began an investigation in cooperation with 
Japanese authorities when it received word of the problem.  Liu 
emphasized that this is an individual case and that China attaches 
great importance to the issue.  Liu expressed confidence that the 
two countries can work together to solve the issue and that it will 
not influence bilateral relations. 
 
India Border Dispute, IOC President, Kosovo, Corpse Trafficking 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶10. Liu confirmed that China had expressed its concern over Indian 
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Arunachal Pradesh.  The 
spokesman refused to comment on reports that IOC head Jacques Rogge 
signed a petition urging China to do more in Darfur.  When asked 
about China's position on Kosovo independence, Liu responded that 
China believes all parties involved should continue their efforts to 
find a resolution of the matter.  In response to a question about 
the trafficking of human corpses, Liu said that China takes 
seriously any reports of such activities and will investigate such 
allegations.
