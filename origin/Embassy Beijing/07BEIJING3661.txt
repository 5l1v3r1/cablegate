A/S Hill Met With Wu Dawei and He Yafei 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the May 31 regular MFA press briefing, spokesperson 
Jiang Yu confirmed that A/S Hill met with VFM Wu Dawei and 
AFM He Yafei on May 30.  A/S Hill exchanged ideas about the 
Six-Party Talks and BDA issue with VFM Wu and discussed 
bilateral issues and Sudan with AFM He.  China believes new 
sanctions against Sudan will only complicate the issue and is 
appealing to other countries to maintain exchange and 
dialogue to implement the third phase of the Annan Plan in 
Sudan, Jiang said.  China is ready to promote the development 
of strategic cooperative partnership between the United 
States and China, Jiang added. 
 
Lee Teng-hui Visiting Japan 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. China is strongly dissatisfied with the Japanese 
government for allowing former Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui to 
enter Japan, Jiang said.  She claimed Lee's aim is to 
undermine China-Japan relations.  Regarding Lee's plans to 
visit the Yasukuni Shrine, Jiang said that mutual effort is 
needed from both China and Japan to properly handle Taiwan 
and historical issues.  China hopes that Japan seriously 
considers China's solemn representations and continues to 
promote joint efforts with China to advance bilateral ties. 
 
Anti-Japanese Protest 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. Asked to comment on a protest carried out in front of the 
Japanese Embassy in Beijing on May 31 by victims and family 
members of those seeking compensation from the Japanese 
government, Jiang said that the PRC protested the Supreme 
Court decision denying compensation earlier this month. 
Japan should recognize that grave crimes were committed, 
should properly address the issues and should properly 
consider the demands and rights of victims and their families. 
 
President Hu to Attend G-8 Summit, Visit Sweden 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5. President Hu Jintao will attend sessions of the G-8 summit 
in Germany.  He is expected to attend meetings along with 
other developing counties as well as bilateral meetings. 
More details will be announced at a briefing by AFM Cui 
Tiankai on June 4. 
 
¶6. President Hu will make a state visit to Sweden on June 
8-10 at the invitation of Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf, with 
whom he will hold talks.  Hu will also meet with Prime 
Minister Reinfeldt and parliament Speaker Westerberg to 
discuss bilateral ties and to map the future of the two 
countries' relationship and is expected to sign an 
environmental protection agreement.

Vice Premier Wu Yi to Visit Russia 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Vice Premier Wu Yi will head a delegation to Russia on 
June 8-12 to attend the 11th Annual St. Petersburg 
International Economic Forum.  This is the third year in a 
row that China has sent a delegation to the Forum.  Wu will 
also participate in events affiliated with the ongoing "Year 
of China in Russia" including meetings with the China-Russia 
Trade and Investment Cooperative and an official of the World 
Economic Forum. 
 
FM Yang Jiechi to Travel to South Korea 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. PRC Foreign Minister Yang will travel to Seoul on June 3 
to attend the Sixth Ministerial Meeting of the Asia 
Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) and will also participate in 
trilateral meetings with foreign ministers of Japan and South 
Korea.  The three sides are expected to discuss bilateral and 
trilateral issues in addition to international and regional 
issues of common interest.  Jiang said the PRC hopes the 
talks will raise the level of cooperation among the three 
countries. 
 
American Cargo Plane Sales to India 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶9. Asked to comment on a report that the United States had 
announced plans to sell six Lockheed Martin Corp. C-130J 
cargo planes to India, Jiang said that she had not read the 
report, but that China hopes for mutual trust in the 
international community and seeks agreements conducive to 
peace and stability in the region and in the world. 
 
PRC Control of Foreign Media in Tibet 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶10. A recent report by the NGO Reporters Without Borders on 
an incident involving two foreign journalists covering Tibet 
was "irresponsible and groundless," Jiang said.  China 
protects the rights of foreign reporters and as long as they 
abide by China's rules and regulations their "normal 
reporting work" will not be restricted.  She added that China 
hopes journalists will abide by the law and report on China 
without prejudice. 
 
EU - Iran Meeting 
----------------- 
 
¶11. Responding to a question regarding the upcoming meeting 
between European Union High Representative Solana and 
Secretary of the Iranian Security Council Larijani, Jiang 
 
SIPDIS 
said China supports diplomatic efforts to resolve the Iran 
nuclear issue and hopes that this round of talks can get the 
regular negotiation process going again so the issue can be 
resolved diplomatically. 
 
Efforts to Stem Illegal Logging in Burma 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶12. Asked if the PRC was doing anything to prevent the trade 
of illegally logged timber from Burma to China, Jiang said 
that in China all logging and trade in timber is done in 
accordance with the law and that the PRC is taking steps to 
crackdown on illegal logging.  She said that illegally logged 
timber does not cross the border from Burma to China and that 
both sides are making joint efforts to prevent illegal 
logging. 
 
Blue Algae Threatens Water Supply 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶13. Jiang characterized the report of a blue-green algae 
bloom in Taihu Lake, the main source of drinking water for 
the city of Wuxi in eastern China, as an internal Chinese 
matter and referred reporters to the relevant authorities.
