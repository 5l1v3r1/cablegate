¶1. Key points at the June 14 MFA Press Conference were: 
 
-- China has taken note of reports indicating the imminent 
transfer of North Korean funds from Macau's Banco Delta Asia 
and hopes relevant parties take steps toward denuclearization 
of the Korean Peninsula. 
 
-- Not responding directly to questions regarding a possible 
switch in Nicaragua's diplomatic relations from Taiwan to 
China, the spokesman said only that China is prepared to have 
normal diplomatic relations with any country. 
 
-- Iraqi President Talabani will visit China on June 20-26. 
 
-- China is taking steps to combat climate change, but 
believes setting CO2 emission limits for developing countries 
is unacceptable. 
 
Six-Party Talks 
--------------- 
 
¶2. At the June 14 regular MFA press briefing, spokesman Qin 
Gang said that China has taken note of relevant parties' 
efforts to resolve the BDA issue and hopes that resolution of 
this issue can advance the Six-Party Talks process.  China 
hopes that all of the parties have the will to implement 
initial actions toward the denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula. 
 
Possible Nicaraguan Recognition Switch? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. Asked to respond to press reports that Nicaragua is 
considering switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to 
China, Qin said that China is prepared to have normal 
relations with any country and hopes more countries will 
follow the "trend of the times." 
 
Iraqi President to Visit China 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4. Qin announced that Iraqi President Talabani will visit 
China June 20-26.  President Talabani will hold talks with 
President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and National People's 
Congress Chairman Wu Bangguo.  President Talabani will visit 
the cities of Xian and Nanjing and is expected to sign 
agreements related to health and education. 
 
Joint Liaison Group Meetings 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5. Qin confirmed that United States and Beijing officials are 
meeting to discuss a variety of law enforcement cooperation 
issues, including anti-corruption, counterterrorism, 
immigration and legal assistance.  China hopes to expand 
cooperation on security with all relevant countries.  When 
asked about the possibility of concluding an extradition 
treaty between the United States and China, Qin said that 
China favors such treaties and is ready to discuss it. 
However, he said, China hopes that the United States 
recognizes China's concerns so that agreement on such a 
treaty can be reached.  When asked to elaborate on these 
concerns, Qin said China wants corrupt Chinese officials to 
be extradited at an early date from the United States so that 
they may face justice. 
 
Report on China's Military "Irresponsible" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶6. The Pentagon report on China's military is 
"irresponsible," Qin said.  China's military is peaceful, 
transparent and open.  China hopes the United States will 
uphold the one-China principle and stop selling weapons to 
Taiwan.  China is ready to enhance mutual understanding and 
trust by increasing military exchanges, he added. 
 
Anti-Communism not in Vogu, CCP Positive Force 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶7. When asked to comment on the U.S. memorial to victims of 
communism, Qin said the United States should abandon its Cold 
War mentality and stop interfering in China's internal 
affairs.  The Chinese Communist Party is a strong force that 
is building democracy and prosperity and safeguarding world 
peace, he stated. 
 
China-Vietnam Territorial Claims 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶8. China hopes Vietnam will stop exploration activities and 
unilateral actions around the Nansha Islands, which are 
China's undisputable sovereign territory, stated Qin. 
China's believes a "proper solution" to this issue must be 
found through consultations and joint-development, he added. 
 
Emissions Limits 
---------------- 
 
¶9. Although China is a minor polluter compared to developed 
countries, Qin claimed, China understands that combating 
climate change requires global action and is acting 
responsibly.  However, setting CO2 emissions limits for 
developing countries is unacceptable, said Qin. 
Industrialization by developed countries is the main reason 
for climate change, he said.
