  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT MODEL 
 
"China's rise ends the unilateral world" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(10/02)(pg 15): "China's implementation of the 
opening up and reform policy and its rapid economic development 
after 1978 has frustrated, for the second time, the United States' 
ambition to build an American Empire (China's participation in the 
Korean War was the first time the United States' attempt to become 
an East Asian empire was defeated).  Without China's rise at that 
time, the U.S. may have succeeded in creating a unilateral world. 
History proves that if China does not develop well, the world will 
be a mess; but if China develops well, no country can achieve global 
hegemony.  The biggest contribution that China has made to world 
politics is that through revolution, reform, and development China 
has shown the world that the Western model is not the only way to 
modernize.  China has also demonstrated that the non-Western world 
does not necessarily follow the West's footsteps, and that China and 
other countries can follow their own paths." 
 
¶2.  U.S.-CHINA TRADE 
 
"How important is poultry in U.S.-China trade?" 
 
The Beijing-based newspaper sponsored by official intellectual 
publication Guangming Daily and Guangdong Provincial official 
publication Nanfang Daily The Beijing News (Xin Jing Bao)(10/06)(pg 
A02): "The U.S. annually exports $850 million in poultry products to 
China, which is a very small part of the overall U.S.-China trade. 
However, it is very profitable for the U.S. poultry industry.  The 
U.S. currently is in great need of overseas markets due to the 
economic recession.  It is not an exaggeration to say that China is 
likely to become the largest overseas market for U.S. poultry. 
China should focus its lobbying efforts [on trade issues] on those 
U.S. states whose congressmen have swing votes and states that have 
the most export potential to China.  Obama is relying on the support 
of conservative Democrats in Congress for his health care reform. 
Obtaining their support and the support of the voters behind them 
will mean a lot for U.S.-China trade." 
 
¶3.  MYANMAR-U.S. RELATIONS 
 
"It takes time to build a smooth Myanmar-U.S. relationship" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao)(10/02)(pg 12): "Since economic sanctions on Myanmar cannot 
achieve the hoped for results, the Obama administration is adjusting 
its current policy to begin engaging the country's military regime 
while continuing to implement sanctions.  This is another example of 
the Obama administration's use of 'smart diplomacy,' which it has 
also used in its approach to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and the 
European missile defense issue.  It is still unclear where 
Myanmar-U.S. relations will go; a smooth development of the 
relationship requires time.  Among the obstacles for the 
Myanmar-U.S. relationship are the U.S.'s policy on Myanmar and the 
deeply-rooted suspicion and distrust of the Myanmar military 
government towards the U.S."
