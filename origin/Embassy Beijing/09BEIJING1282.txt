  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. U.S.-IRAN RELATIONS 
 
"A positive turn for U.S-Iran relations" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao)(05/13): "Recently, Iran has released the female American 
Journalist that it held. The American media felt calm and relief. 
However, the Obama administration denies that there was a secret 
deal between the U.S. and Iran concerning the release of the 
journalist. Analysts predict that this issue will not influence the 
Iran-U.S. peace process. Senior Iranian officials have shown good 
will towards the U.S. Iran's tough stance has loosened since Obama 
took office.  Although senior Iranian official's hostility against 
the U.S. is still deep-rooted, Iran's willingness to improve 
relations with the U.S. has increased.  Releasing the journalist 
will positively influence the process of improving U.S.-Iran 
relations. However, the deeply accumulated anger between the two 
will not be easily resolved because of this move by Iran.  An 
overall improvement of the bilateral relations will not be realized 
because Iran released a journalist." 
 
¶2. H1N1 
 
"Avoid finger-pointing before pandemic" 
 
Global Times English (English-language daily published by the 
People's Daily)(05/13): "What is shown on TV in Mexico City looks 
familiar to most Chinese people. This time around, China is more 
experienced and is capable of taking timely and effective action. 
The Chinese government took immediate action to implement effective 
counter-measures. As for China, with its mammoth population and 
diverse geography, the public heath infrastructure still needs 
improvement. China in many ways is more vulnerable to outbreaks of 
communicable diseases than other countries. 
The swine flu crisis requires even greater-than-normal cooperation 
and coordination between countries and governments. It is therefore 
all the more important for exaggerated or emotionally charged 
statements that stoke fear and misunderstanding to be avoided. 
Isolation has proven to be one of the most effective methods in 
preventing the spread of communicable diseases. China has offered 
direct and tangible assistance to Mexico in the form of $5 million 
in financial aid to help combat the H1N1 flu, and overall has been 
very supportive of the Mexican government's fight against the fatal 
epidemic. Cooperation and mutual understanding will be important and 
much-needed weapons in the fight against this virus, not unfounded 
criticism and misdirected complaints." 
 
¶3. RMB CURRENCY 
 
"If the RMB leads the world, it will be very attractive to Europe" 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(05/13): "The president of the 
Germany-China Committee of German Federal Congress has stated that 
although the G2 relationship is strong, it is hoped that China will 
not only focus on the U.S., neglecting its opportunities to 
cooperate with Germany and Europe.  There are opportunities to 
cooperate on renewable energy and environmental protection. 
Cooperation in the energy sector, where Germany would provide the 
technology and China could provide the resources, is a favorable 
possibility.  In spite of the economic recession, trade between 
China and Europe has been less than expected; however development is 
still trending well.  Germany is still optimistic about its economy 
even though its exports are sliding.  But Germany still has a firm 
industrial foundation.  The president of the Germany-China Committee 
of German Federal Congress agreed with the President of the People's 
Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan's earlier comments that another 
currency should replace the U.S. dollar and lead the world's 
economic system.  It is very attractive for Europe to use the RMB as 
the leading currency."
