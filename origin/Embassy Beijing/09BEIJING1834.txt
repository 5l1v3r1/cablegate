  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. INTERNET CENSORSHIP 
 
"Foreign media demonizes the fighting over Green Dam software" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/02): "The postponement of the Chinese 
government's installation of Green Dam software has been widely 
welcomed by the West.  Some Western media expressed their pride, 
suggesting that they have won.  The Chinese government's primary 
goal behind installing this software is very simple.  However it was 
complicated by the West.  Chinese experts suggest that China does 
not have enough experience in installing the software.  The West 
seems to believe that once computer manufacturers install the 
software, it is 'obedient' to the government and becomes the 
government's follower.  It is the Western media who has purposely 
created this hostile environment.  Chinese experts also indicate 
that postponing the installation should be taken as the result of 
pressure from the West.  In fact, China has not altered its 
principles.  The Chinese government did not conduct sufficient 
internal communication and external promotion on the software 
beforehand.  The reason [given by the Chinese government] of 
insufficient time is a trust-worthy one.  The modernization of 
China's politics has not yet been achieved successfully.  A balance 
needs to be achieved between political modernization and Internet 
control." 
 
¶2. CYBER WAR 
 
"The U.S. refuses to establish rules for cyber warfare" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (07/02): "The arms 
race with the U.S. pulled the former Soviet Union apart.  What is 
the chance that Russia will win against the U.S. in the current 
cyber battlefield?  Considering the great divergences between the 
two countries on how to guarantee network security and how to 
conduct international cooperation, the coming meeting of the U.S. 
and Russia to discuss cyber warfare rules has little chance of 
reaching consensus.  Russia wants to establish an international 
treaty on cyber warfare as the core network technology is in the 
U.S.'s hands.  Once a cyber war breaks out, the U.S. Government can 
use the giant IT companies' strengths at anytime which makes it 
terribly powerful.  If other countries join in the cyber arms race, 
the U.S. would have the advantage in dragging other countries 
down." 
 
¶3. NORTH KOREA 
 
"American, Japanese and South Korean spies have no effective way to 
deal with North Korea" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/02): "Over the years, North Korea has 
continuously varied its actions on the nuclear issue.  In contrast, 
each time the U.S., Japan and South Korea only deal with the issue 
passively.  It seems they don't have a clue what North Korea has in 
mind.  Previously North Korea seldom arrested spies.  However, since 
2006, North Korea has successively publicized three spy cases. 
Chinese experts indicate that it is highly possible that the three 
cases are true. ...Most of spying against North Korea is related to 
South Korea.  It is difficult to send spies to North Korea and even 
more difficult to infiltrate the local North Korean people."
