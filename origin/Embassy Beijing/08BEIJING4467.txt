  Editorial Quotes

¶1. TIBET 
 
a. "Sarkozy provokes France-China storm" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/08): "The World's media is feeling the 
storm in the China-France diplomatic feud. Public opinion suggests 
that China will take actions in order to sanction France.  A 
complicated wrestling between China and France concerning wills, 
strength and diplomatic measures will happen. The World will have a 
more careful evaluation on China during this process. Chinese 
experts indicated that it is undoubted that both France and China 
will be harmed if China takes sanctions against France. But the 
Tibet issue concerns China's sovereignty.  China can't make a 
compromise on the issue, even if it has to endure economic loss. In 
the recent years, the U.S. and Japan seem to have been aware of 
where China's red line is, but Europe, it seems doesn't." 
 
b. "An unacceptable affront" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (12/08): " 
Nicolas Sarkozy's meeting with the Dalai Lama hit Chinese nerves 
hard. But, the French president probably was betting on the 
assumption that China and France will have to do business anyway. 
...He broke this country's clearly defined bottom-line for 
maintaining friendly state-to-state relations. For whatever the 
consequences of his stunt will be, the arrogant French president has 
only himself to blame. 
He asked for it. ...Government preference may determine the purchase 
of Airbuses, or Boeings. But it cannot force people to travel to 
places they dislike, be it Paris, or Provence. Nor can it make 
consumers buy from brand names they feel bad about, be it Louis 
Vuitton, or Carrefour. 
...he ignored the Chinese side's special sensitivities on matters of 
sovereignty. He made reconciliatory gestures after the unpleasant 
pre-Olympic episodes, and was forgiven by the Chinese. But there is 
a limit to everything. What happened Saturday calls into question 
all his previous efforts to repair ties, and his personal 
credibility as well." 
 
¶2. U.S. DIPLOMACY 
 
"Former American official suggests Obama to go to China on the first 
oversea visit" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/08): "An article in Newsweek suggests that 
Obama should visit China on his first presidential trip. Some 
American experts indicate that holding a U.S.-China summit is an 
urgent task for Obama. Chinese experts think that the idea of Obama 
visiting China first is unlikely. This suggestion reveals the 
willingness of certain people in the U.S. to improve U.S.-China 
relations. But it is still not the mainstream idea and has aroused 
great disputes in the U.S. However, in the U.S. scholars circle, 
holding the U.S.-China talks has gained many supports. Chinese 
experts believe that Obama's first presidential visit will be Europe 
to improve the U.S. image. Relations with China are not the most 
urgent issue on the U.S. diplomatic agenda. Even if the U.S. 
President chooses Eastern Asia as his first visit, normally Japan 
will be the first stop. What's more, Japan has already started to 
worry about the heated-up relations with China exceeding the 
relations with Japan. Last week the Strategic Economic Dialogue just 
ended. European media has witnessed the changes of U.S.-China 
strength status."
