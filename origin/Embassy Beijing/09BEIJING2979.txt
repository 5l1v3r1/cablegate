¶1.  REACTION TO STEINBERG CNAS SPEECH 
 
"Seizing the opportunity of U.S.-China 'strategic reassurance'" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(10/26)(pg 14): "U.S. Deputy Secretary of 
State James Steinberg recently (September 24 in a speech at the 
Center for a New American Security) described the future of 
U.S.-China relations in terms of 'strategic reassurance.' 
Reassurance means looking for a new foundation for strategic balance 
and admitting that the past foundation was not concrete, a problem 
for which the U.S. is primarily responsible.  The emphasis on 
reassurance means that we do not support some of the United States' 
traditional views on China.  First, the U.S. believes that its 
strategic goals are clear while China's are obscure.  China is not 
opposed to 'strategic transparency' and doubts the U.S.'s logic. 
Second, Steinberg's theory does not mention the differences between 
the political systems in the U.S. and China.  The two countries 
cannot build 'reassurance' based on the idea that 'Western democracy 
is superior.'  Third, in his foreign policy, Obama has promoted 
'universal' values.  China must avoid such a value system and 
instead emphasize its own values.  Steinberg's theory indicates that 
the U.S. has started seriously considering the long-term prospects 
for U.S.-China relations.  The upcoming high-level meetings between 
the two countries may start substantive strategic dialogue and end 
the history of suspicious diplomatic games." 
 
¶2.  MYANMAR 
 
"The United States to compete with China for influence on Myanmar" 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated to the 
official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (10/27) (pg 4): 
"The Obama administration's adjustment in its policy towards Myanmar 
is meant to consolidate the U.S.'s dominant position in Southeast 
Asia and prevent East Asian countries from tilting towards China, 
thus containing the rise of China.  China has a strong influence on 
its neighboring countries, such as Myanmar, North Korea and 
Pakistan.  The U.S. has recently expanded its contacts with these 
countries in an attempt to weaken China's influence.  The military 
government in Myanmar is also actively seeking to improve relations 
with the U.S. in order to maintain its power in the future. 
However, the divergence of views between the U.S. and Myanmar over 
democratization and human rights has contributed to a very low 
degree of trust between the two countries.  In addition, there is 
still a lot of opposition in the United States and its allies to the 
removal of sanctions on Myanmar.  Thus, there is still a long way to 
go for the improvement of U.S.-Myanmar relations." 
 
¶3.  EAST ASIAN COMMUNITY 
 
"The East Asian Community might be Asia-Pacific-oriented" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(10/27)(pg 1): 
"As long as the United States respects the sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of other countries and changes its Cold War 
mentality of 'containment,' a number of major Asian countries are 
expected to take a 'moderate' and 'non-insulated' attitude towards 
U.S. participation in the East Asian Community.  If the East Asian 
Community accepts the United States, the organization will likely 
become 'Asia-Pacific-oriented.'  Independent management without 
specific leadership is the most suitable development model for the 
East Asian Community, where China, Japan, and South Korea on the one 
hand and ASEAN on the other have created a balanced momentum.  Asian 
foreign exchange reserves now increasing rely on China's rapidly 
growing supply capability.  Japan's dream of leading an Asian IMF 
will continue to be stymied."
