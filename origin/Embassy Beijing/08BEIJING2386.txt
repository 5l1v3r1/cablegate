¶1. (SBU) PolOff on June 18 delivered to MFA ref b points 
urging Chinese support for consensus adoption of a 
U.S.-drafted UNSC resolution on sexual violence in situations 
of armed conflict and China's agreement to withdraw from 
suggested amendments that would weaken key elements of that 
resolution.  MFA International Organizations and Conferences 
Department UN Division Deputy Director Shen Yinyin said 
China's concerns on the issues raised in the points are "well 
known."  While she noted that the United States and China 
share a common general position on the issue of sexual 
violence in armed conflict, she did not offer any substantive 
response to our request that China withdraw its opposition to 
the relevant points. Shen said only that she would coordinate 
with the Chinese UN Mission to communicate our concerns.
