Africa: New MFA Appointment, 275 Engineers to Sudan 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2.  At the May 10 regular press briefing, MFA Spokeswoman 
Jiang Yu announced the appointment of Liu Guijin to the newly 
created position of "special representative for African 
affairs," adding that Liu will focus on the Darfur issue. 
Liu previously served as Ambassador to South Africa, Zimbabwe 
and as MFA Director General for African Affairs.  When asked 
about the reason for the appointment, Jiang cited China's 
promotion of the strategic partnership with Africa and 
mentioned the success of the November African summit in 
Beijing and the resulting 8-point proposal for China-Africa 
cooperation. 
 
¶3.  China will send a team of 275 engineers to participate in 
the implementation of the second phase of the Annan Plan at 
the request of the UN in addition to humanitarian assistance 
and donations, said Jiang.  Deflecting a question regarding a 
letter to President Hu signed by over 100 members of the 
United States Congress criticizing China's handling of the 
Darfur issue, Jiang emphasized China's efforts toward a 
proper solution through an exchange of visits, the sending of 
a special envoy and other consultations.  She acknowledged 
the United States' positive role in the process, including 
its sending a Special Envoy for the Sudan issue to Beijing. 
The Chinese government hopes the international community can 
promote the political process and the Annan Plan in a 
balanced way, while urging the opposition in Darfur to resume 
dialogue with the Sudanese government. 
 
Melamine Contamination Case, Counterfeit Drugs 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4.  When asked for information on the melamine contamination 
case, the spokeswoman stated that the Administration for 
Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine has acted on 
the case and already made representation to the United 
States.  The relevant enterprises and culprits will be dealt 
with and China is ready for further cooperation on this 
issue, she said.  Asked for information on the issues of 
counterfeit drugs and deaths of pigs in Guangzhou, Jiang 
referred the reporter's questions to the relevant 
authorities, but asserted that China plans to increase safety 
efforts in production in these areas. 
 
Bush-Hu Conversation 
-------------------- 
 
¶5.  During a May 9 phone conversation, Presidents Bush and Hu 
discussed general bilateral issues, the upcoming Strategic 
Economic Dialogue, the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue and 
international climate change, said Jiang.  On the issue of 
climate change, Jiang maintained that China and the United 
States have common interests and potential for cooperation in 
the field.  She added that China is ready to make joint 
efforts with the United States and the international 
community to promote energy efficiency and environmental 
protection.

No Information on Huang Ju's Health 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  The MFA has taken note of the responses of the relevant 
authorities and can offer no new information, said Jiang in 
response to questions about rumors of Executive Vice Premier 
Huang Ju's death. 
 
African Development Bank Meeting in Shanghai 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  Through a series of seminars during the May 16-17 African 
Development Bank annual board meeting in Shanghai, China will 
seek to support the role of African banks and exchange 
development experiences, said the spokeswoman.  Jiang noted 
China has donated USD 314 million to the African Development 
Bank since joining in 1985 and currently holds 1.17 percent 
of total shares. 
 
Second SED to Increase Trust and Cooperation 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  Jiang said the Strategic Economic Dialogue is an 
important opportunity to promote the healthy development of 
bilateral ties and expressed hope for the exchange of ideas 
so as to increase trust and cooperation in various fields. 
Asked which ministers will accompany Vice Premier Wu Yi to 
the United States for the SED, Jiang replied that the 
relevant information would be released in due course. 
 
Dalai Lama Cancels Trip to Belgium 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  Asked about China's role in the Dalai Lama's canceling of 
an upcoming trip to Belgium, Jiang commented on the good 
relations between China and Belgium and thanked the Belgian 
government for sticking to the one-China policy.  The Dalai 
Lama's words prove that he is not a simple religious figure, 
she said, but rather a political exile long engaged in 
"splittist" activities under the disguise of religion.  Jiang 
cautioned relevant countries to stay alert to his attempts to 
undermine China's international relations and to split the 
Motherland. 
 
IPR Protection, PM Blair Resignation 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶10.  The Chinese Government attaches great importance to IPR 
protection and China's protection measures are 
internationally recognized and approved by the WTO, said 
Jiang when asked about Japanese media reports of the 
Disneyland knock-off "Shijingshan Park" outside Beijing.  She 
referred specific questions on the matter to the relevant 
Beijing authorities.  Jiang would not comment on the expected 
resignation of UK PM Blair, but remarked that China is ready 
to establish serious dialogue ad cooperation in various 
fields with the Unite Kingdom in strengthening a strategic 
partnership. 
 
Visits: Netherlands, UK 
----------------------- 
 
¶11.  Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen will pay an 
official visit to China May 15-17, as will British Foreign 
Secretary Margaret Beckett May 16-21.
