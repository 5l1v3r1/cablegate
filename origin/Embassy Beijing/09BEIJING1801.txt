  Editorial Quotes

¶1. GREEN DAM 
 
"The network is a sensitive zone for the China-West conflict" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/30): "Recently, concerning friction 
between China and the West, internet supervision has become a 
sensitive topic.  The U.S. has called on the Chinese government to 
resist cyber supervision.  This doesn't sound as resentful as their 
earlier calls resisting the Beijing Olympics.  In this way, the West 
is increasing its interference in Chinese society.  The competition 
between China and the West on this issue is likely to be a marathon. 
 It requires that any cyber supervision measures by China first gain 
the support of the Chinese netizens.  Chinese experts indicate that 
'Green Dam' is just another standard install, just like all 
installed antivirus software.  Whether customers want to use it 
totally depends on their choice.  They can uninstall the software at 
any time.  However, installing it is a governmental action.  The 
government will not pass along the added cost to the companies.  The 
exaggerations on the software by western countries are just the 
beginning of another round of attacks on China.  The west will use 
every possible means to attack China.  This is a phenomenon that 
China can't avoid during its rise." 
 
¶2. U.S. POLICY 
 
Why is the U.S. dollar bonded to oil? 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/30):  "Both oil and the USD do not 
singularly exist; they are connected to each other.  USD oil 
dealings show the complexity of international politics and 
economics.  The oil supply is naturally unbalanced.  However, the 
international market always has a large need for oil.  The U.S. 
needs to control the international oil supply and therefore control 
the currency of international oil deals.  Since oil-producing 
countries absolutely dominate the currency, by dominating the oil 
producing countries one can further dominate oil dealing currency. 
The U.S. has bonded the USD with oil deals in order to serve its 
national interests.  By carefully plotting 'oil to the USD', the 
U.S. economy rapidly galloped in the 1970s, creating incompatible 
competitiveness." 
 
¶3. U.S. MILITARY 
 
"The cyber military department of the U.S. will lead to substantial 
differences in future wars" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/30): "The recent establishment of the U.S. 
Cyber Command Office has produced the first cyber military office. 
As Secretary Gates prepares to nominate a four-star General as a 
commander, a new 21st century military will begin.  The U.S. places 
equal emphasizes on their regular forces, Air, Army, Navy and Marine 
troops and their Cyber Force and Space Force.  Every major 
revolution in the military field will be accompanied by fierce wars. 
 Russia has had a severe reaction to the U.S. establishment of the 
cyber war command office.  Compared to the U.S. and Russia, the war 
and anti-war knowledge of some Chinese personnel has been left far 
behind and is, to a dangerous level, out-of-date." 
 
¶4. U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC RELATIONS 
 
"Americans deposit money; the Chinese do not need to be afraid" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/30): "The average personal deposit rate 
for American citizens, as of the end of May 2009, reached 6.9%. 
This ignites serious concerns within the Chinese economy.  Chinese 
exports and economy's structure are dependent on consumption by 
Americans.  However, the increased deposit rate doesn't necessarily 
mean that Americans have changed their consumption behavior.  Along 
with economic recovery, the deposit rate will continue to decrease. 
One should not expect that American's living standards will change 
away from consumption after the financial crisis.  The influence of 
the crisis will be limited.  The resumption of the pre-consumption 
living standards of the U.S. won't bring China's economy sustainable 
growth.  It should be noted that the dependence of China's economic 
growth on the U.S. market will continuously decrease in the future. 
China's ongoing industrial structural reform will rely more on the 
domestic needs of infrastructure, new energy, social insurance, 
etc."
