SUBJECT: UN REFORM: CHINA BELIEVES REFORM ISSUES SHOULD BE 
RESOLVED IN NEW YORK 
 
REF: STATE 31831 
 
(SBU) China believes UN reform issues, such as those 
raised in reftel concerning the Redesign Panel report, 
should be resolved by experts on the Fifth and Sixth 
Committees in New York, MFA International 
Organizations Department UN Division Deputy Director 
Yao Shaojun told poloff March 19.  Responding to 
poloff's March 14 delivery of reftel message, Yao said 
China understands the United States' concerns about 
the financial impact and potential administrative 
burden of some of the Redesign Panel's 
recommendations.  At this stage, Beijing is not 
inclined to delve into the details of the personnel 
system and will defer to its experts in New York, he 
said.
