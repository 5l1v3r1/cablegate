IAEA Report on Iran 
------------------- 
 
¶2. At the September 16 regular MFA press briefing, spokesperson 
Jiang Yu said that China has "taken note of the report submitted by 
the IAEA Director General" regarding Iran. China "hopes that Iran 
will keep up its cooperation with the IAEA for the early settlement 
of the issue."  Dialogue and negotiation are the only ways to reach 
a "comprehensive, lasting and proper settlement," said Jiang.  Asked 
for China's reaction to possible U.S. sanctions, Jiang said that 
"sanctions are not the way to resolve the issue." 
 
Kim Jong-il 
----------- 
 
¶3. Jiang said that she has no information related to reports that 
Chinese doctors were sent to North Korea.  Jiang also denied reports 
that China and the United States has begun making "contingency 
plans" for the fall of Kim Jong-il, saying China and the United 
States, "do not have contact" on the issue. 
 
U.S. Financial Woes 
------------------- 
 
¶4. Asked for China's reaction to the financial crises in the United 
States, Jiang referred the reporter to relevant authorities saying 
that "China hopes the United States can overcome the subprime crisis 
and stabilize exchange rates." 
 
Chavez China Visit 
------------------ 
 
¶5. Asked for more information regarding the visit of Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez to China on September 23-25, Jiang said that 
Chavez will meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao and other leaders 
to "exchange views on bilateral relations and other issues of common 
interest."  China and Venezuela will sign agreements relating to 
legal cooperation, sports, and quality inspection, Jiang added. 
Asked whether any oil agreements will be signed during Chavez's 
stay, Jiang would only comment that "the two sides are keeping 
consultations."  Jiang noted that oil from Venezuela accounts for 
only 4 percent of China's total oil imports.  China's bilateral 
relationship with Venezuela is based on "equality and mutual 
benefit" and is "not directed against any other countries." 
 
Infant Formula Product Safety and New Zealand 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Asked to confirm whether the New Zealand government has contacted 
the MFA regarding quality control allegations at the infant formula 
company Sanlu (a New Zealand joint venture linked to sales of 
tainted infant formula that has caused sickness in over 1,000 
Chinese infants so far), Jiang said that China has been improving 
its food safety and quality inspection before referring the reporter 
to relevant authorities.  Asked whether the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs would be the relevant authority for contact between the 
Chinese and New Zealand governments, Jiang said that "other 
agencies" also play a role.

¶7. In response to a reporter's question, Jiang said that she had not
