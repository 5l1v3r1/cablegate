SUBJECT: ROK TO FOLLOW EU LEAD ON GOLDSTONE REPORT 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered EAP/K-Embassy Seoul e-mail message 
on 10/1 to Cho Tae-ick, Director of MOFAT's Human Rights and 
Social Affairs Division, calling on the ROK to back the USG 
effort to get an unbiased resolution on the Goldstone Report. 
 Cho underscored that the ROK would likely follow the lead of 
the EU and Japan.  He added, though, that the ROK "cannot say 
'yes' to a biased resolution."  Seoul, Cho emphasized, was 
still hoping for a resolution that reflected consensus.
