SUBJECT: ROK WILLING TO PROSECUTE PIRATES, SEEKS 
MULTILATERAL ENFORCEMENT MEASURES 
 
REF: SECSTATE 152276 
 
Classified By: DCM Bill Stanton.  Reasons 1.4 (b/d). 
 
¶1. (C) In response to reftel demarche and non-paper, Park 
In-kook, Deputy Foreign Minister for International 
Organizations and Global Issues, agreed on the need for 
stronger multilateral enforcement mechanisms against piracy. 
In a November 6 meeting with the DCM, Park asked in 
particular about the U.S. view of the Government of Spain's 
proposal to address piracy off the east coast of Africa 
through an international coalition of countries whose 
shipping was most at risk of Somali piracy.  Spanish fishing 
fleets based in the Seychelles, for example, faced harassment 
from pirates in that area.  Spain had therefore invited the 
PRC, Japan, and the ROK to join existing EU coalitions 
against piracy, Park said.  Denmark and possibly Portugal 
would also be interested in such an effort, Park said.  While 
the ROK was open to this possibility, it wanted to consult 
first with the U.S. to hear USG views on the initiative.  The 
ROK, Park added, would participate in any USG-supported 
international effort against piracy. 
 
¶2. (C) Park said the ROKG was actively seeking multilateral 
enforcement mechanisms against piracy after recent incidents 
requiring direct negotiations with pirates.  In an apparent 
reference to alleged concessions the Koreans might have made 
to win the return of their citizens, Park noted that the 
ultimate goal for Korea was a no-concessions policy, but 
meanwhile the ROKG was forced to take into account "national 
sentiment" on ensuring the safe return of Korean citizens. 
As the International Maritime Organization (IMO) would 
require a referral to the UNSC in order to implement 
effective action, Park did not believe the IMO was an 
effective mechanism by itself. 
 
¶3. (C) Also at the meeting, Lee Kyoo-ho, Assistant Director 
for Disarmament and Nonproliferation, stated that the ROK 
claimed the right to protect its citizens worldwide, and 
would theoretically have the jurisdiction to prosecute the 
pirates who had taken the Golden Nori.  MOFAT had not yet 
considered in detail, however, how the ROKG would handle 
pirates involved in seizing the Golden Nori if they were 
captured, but Lee emphasized that the ROKG would want to 
coordinate with the USG in that event.
