REF: SECSTATE 45792 
 
(U) In a May 14 meeting with ROK Deputy Foreign Minister Lee 
Yong-joon, DCM conveyed reftel points, strongly urging MOFAT 
to promote Cuba Solidarity Day.  Lee said that ROKG's 
position on Cuba was very close to that of the USG.  South 
Korea never normalized relations with Cuba; Israel and the 
U.S. are the only other countries similarly without normal 
relations with Cuba.  Lee said he would discuss with his 
colleagues on how the ROKG could promote Cuba Solidarity Day, 
but noted that there was no public interest in this issue.
