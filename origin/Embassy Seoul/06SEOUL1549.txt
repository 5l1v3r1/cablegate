SUBJECT: PHASED REDUCTION OF ROK ZAYTUN UNIT IN IRAQ 
 
REF: SEOUL 5020 
 
As planned (reftel), the ROK is initiating a phased drawdown 
of the ROK troop contingent in Iraq, starting with a modest 
reduction of 40 troops this month.  An additional 200 troops 
will depart Iraq in June, with approximately 800 troops being 
withdrawn during the second half of the year.  According to 
MND officials, medical and engineering units will be kept at 
current levels in order to minimize the impact on the Zaytun 
Unit's key functions; the bulk of the reductions will come 
from the infantry.  Also, rather than withdrawing forces 
currently on the ground, the ROK plans to realize part of the 
reduction by not replacing some of the troops returning home 
after six-month tours.  By the end of 2006, the Zaytun Unit, 
currently at 3,200 troops, will be reduced to approximately 
2,200 troops.  As a part of the drawdown, the ROK military 
also plans to withdraw some equipment from Irbil.
