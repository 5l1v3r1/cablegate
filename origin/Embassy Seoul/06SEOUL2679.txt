REF: STATE 130145 
 
(SBU) On August 9, poloff conveyed reftel points urging 
countries to oppose a special session of the UN Human Rights 
Council on the situation in Lebanon to Jang Hyun-cheol, 
Deputy Director of the Human Rights and Social Affairs 
Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Jang 
said he appreciated the USG position and it was unclear what 
the session could accomplish, but as a UNHRC member Seoul was 
not in a position to obstruct the OIC request for a meeting. 
It would make it easier for Seoul if EU countries spoke with 
one voice opposing the session or rejecting unhelpful 
language during discussions.  He hoped the USG would soon 
become a UNHRC member to be able to present its voice at the 
table.
