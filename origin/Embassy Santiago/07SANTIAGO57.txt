SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - CHAVEZ'S SOCIALIST REVOLUTION 
 
¶1. On January 11, conservative, influential newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (circ. 129,000) carried an opinion column by international 
analyst Karin Ebensperger entitled "The Conscience of the Global 
Left."  Quote: 
 
¶2. "OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza should not feel bad 
for becoming a member of the list of those offended by Hugo 
Chavez....  What is alarming is the weak reaction by certain 
politicians who give Chavez, and the totalitarianism that he is 
imposing under his so-called 'Twenty First Century Socialism,' the 
benefit of the doubt. These are the same ones that applaud the 
dictatorship imposed by Fidel Castro in Cuba for more than 40 
years....  The Venezuelan's revolution is something to fear...and 
what is more dangerous is that he is preparing a single educational 
system 'to demolish capitalist values.'  Should Chavez achieve 
(planting) ideology in education, then Fidel Castro could rest 
assured.  He has a successor."
