¶1. (U) In response to reftel requests, Post provides the following 
initial plans for promoting Cuba Solidarity Day in Chile: 
 
--DVC with senior USG officials and Chilean print media to highlight 
Cuba Solidarity Day and increase awareness in Chile about the plight 
of Cuba's prisoners of conscience and drum up support for democracy 
in Cuba.  (Note:  WHA A/S Shannon's DVC on Cuba with Chilean 
journalists in 2006 generated considerable media coverage in Chile. 
Secretary Gutierrez also would be a major draw in Santiago, if 
available.); 
 
--Host on the Embassy's radio show (broadcasted on over 100 Chilean 
radio stations throughout the country) Chilean NGO and/or academic 
figures to discuss the political situation in Cuba; 
 
-- Provide Chilean opinion makers and media contacts an information 
packet on Cuba Solidarity Day; and, 
 
--Post on the Embassy website U.S.-based events and activities in 
support of Cuba Solidarity Day. 
 
¶2. (SBU) One well-placed Foreign Ministry official told Poloff on 
May 5 that the Chilean government presently is not planning to 
promote Cuba Solidarity Day. 
 
¶3. (U) Post will look for additional opportunities between now and 
May 21 to engage GOC officials and others to promote Cuba Solidarity 
day, as appropriate.  (Note:  May 21 is a national holiday in Chile. 
 Therefore, Post will undertake any activities in support of Cuba 
Solidarity Day before then.)
