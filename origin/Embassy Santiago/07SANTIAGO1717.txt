SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - CHAVEZ'S REGIONAL INFLUENCE 
 
¶1. On October 21, conservative, influential, newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (Sun. circ. 260,108) carried a column by Andres 
Oppenheimer entitled "Hugo Chavez' Project in the Continent." 
Quote: 
 
¶2. "It is no mystery that Hugo Chavez...wants to destabilize Latin 
American countries that have good relations with the United States. 
He openly states it on an internet webpage of the Ministry of 
Communications....  Chavez is following in Fidel Castro's footsteps, 
creating artificial conflicts with internal 'enemies' to build a 
global cause and use them as a justification to remain in power 
forever.  The difference is that unlike Castro... Chavez has tons of 
money.  But what bothers me the most is that the United States is 
financing his efforts....  With its absurdly large use of 
unnecessary fuel, the United States is paying Chavez US$34 billion 
for oil each year.  As long as the United States continues to pay 
that fortune, Chavez will continue to have all the money in the 
world to finance 'alternative movements' in countries that have good 
relations with the United States."
