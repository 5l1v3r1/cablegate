SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - CHAVEZ' PROPOSALS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL 
REFORM 
 
¶1. On August 17, government-owned, editorially independent "La 
Nacion" (circ. 4,200) carried a column by international analyst Raul 
Sohr entitled "Chavez on the Offensive."  Quote: 
 
¶2. "A seven-year presidential term with the possibility of immediate 
reelection -- as easy as that," concluded Venezuelan President Hugo 
Chavez when he announced his proposals for constitutional reform.... 
 This would impose his will for a unique and centered leadership in 
the leader of the Bolivarian movement....  What is new in this 
situation...is that, by utilizing democratic (tools), he proposes 
reforms that rupture economic and political structures.  Until now, 
all changes have been submitted to popular consultation and have 
counted with clear support.  Under those circumstances, to 
disqualify the authoritarianism of a regime is debatable, especially 
if it obtains a majority in electoral processes that international 
observers declare valid.  This is what allows the Venezuelan 
President to proclaim: Vox Populi, Vox Dei."
