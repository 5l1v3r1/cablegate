On May 4, conservative, influential newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (circ. 116,807) ran an editorial entitled,  "Uncertainty 
in Latin America."  Quotes: 
 
"Protected by his oil prosperity and as part of his rivalry with the 
United States, Hugo Chavez has tried to take a protagonist role in 
the region.  His political and economic intervention has caused 
confrontations with successive governments, culminating in 
interference with Lima's and Bogota's commercial accords with 
Washington, and interference in Peru's electoral process, which has 
resulted in the withdrawal of Peru's ambassador to Caracas.  Chavez 
seeks to expand his ideological axis in Peru...via Ollanta Humala's 
candidacy and has gained at least the neutrality of Presidents Lula 
and Kirchner through his association with Mercosur and by (offering) 
a secure gas supply....  Venezuela has also presented a challenging 
candidacy to the UN Security Council and Chavez makes attacks on 
U.S. President George Bush a pillar of his rhetoric. 
 
"It is necessary to wait for and work toward a drawing down and 
moderation of these processes.  The situation should tend to 
stabilize.  Chile's diplomacy must assist discreetly without taking 
inappropriate leading roles and must exert extreme caution in 
bilateral accords, its behavior in the Organization of American 
States or other regional entities and try to improve relations with 
each country individually."
