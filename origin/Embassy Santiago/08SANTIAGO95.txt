E/POLoff delivered reftel demarche to Jorge Chocair, Director of International Relations and Extraditions, at the Ministerio Publico (MP - Chile's Public Prosecutors Office) 	and Gloria Sepulveda, Director of International Relations at SENAME (Chile's national agency for minors).  Chocair said clearly he understood our position, and that the goal of the 	GOC delegation was technical cooperation.  He said he would share our perspective with the rest of the delegation. Sepulveda said her understanding too was that the goal was simply to improve cooperation, and that the agenda of the conference included nothing about developing formal 	recommendations.

-- Pablo Varas, SERNAM (Chile's agency for women's affairs) 
-- Rosa Melendez, ANI (Chile's intelligence agency)
