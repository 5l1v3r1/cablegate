On July 31, conservative, influential newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (circ. 116,807) ran an editorial entitled "The Security 
Council Vote."  Quote: 
 
"Our government has done well in not committing to candidates 
presented thus far, in resisting the pressure to support one or 
another, and in favoring greater consensus....  The reasons that 
make it difficult and even impossible for the Chavez regime to 
represent the region on some of the most important international 
policy issues will no doubt persist until October.  But it does not 
seem reasonable, consistent with our identity and our domestic 
consensus, or even politically wise, to give our vote to the Chavez 
regime's bid."
