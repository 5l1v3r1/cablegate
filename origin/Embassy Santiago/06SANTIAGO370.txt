SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - VENEZUELA 
 
On February 21, conservative, afternoon "La Segunda" (circ. 31,834) 
carried an editorial entitled "President Chavez' Conflicts." Quote: 
 
"We can see why President Lagos chose to move away from the recent 
verbal clash between Hugo Chavez and U.S. Secretary Condoleezza 
Rice, denying his participation in a 'common front' and stating that 
he has kept an open dialogue with other governments in the 
region.... But this caution does not eliminate the real threat that 
Chavez represents for the region and which it will have to confront 
sooner or later. 
 
There are ongoing events that confirm Chavez' inclination to 
interfere in the affairs of others.  For example, he has now been 
accused of offering Peruvians in Venezuela dual nationality on the 
condition that they vote for Humala in Peru and then for him.... The 
Bolivian leader's announcement that he wants to remain in office 
until 2031 is nothing to kid about either....  This means there will 
be an inevitable collision, sooner or later, not just with U.S. 
political strategy, but with the region's democratic commitment."
