SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: IRAN, NUCLEAR PROGRAM 
 
On April 20, conservative afternoon daily "La Segunda" (circ. 
31,934) carried an editorial entitled, "The Iranian Threat." 
Quote: 
 
"It is evident that Tehran will not abide by the U.N. Security 
Council deadline to stop its nuclear program....  President Bush's 
statements...indicating that he does not rule out a military attack 
on Iran, and (Iranian President) Ahmadinejad's response that Iran 
would cut off the hands of its attackers, shows a high level of 
tension....  But there is a greater threat than the possibility of a 
military attack on Iran...and that is Tehran's threat that it has 
40,000 suicide terrorists....  The deliberate sacrifice of one's own 
life is hard to counter with reasonable arguments and clashes 
directly with the hedonistic mentality that prevails in more 
developed nations....  It is obvious that this cultural abyss stands 
in the way of long-lasting peace and that it is urgent to build 
bridges to establish the foundations for understanding."
