SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM - DVC WITH 
AMBASSADOR GREG SCHULTE 
 
 
¶1.  Summary: U.S. Representative to the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, Ambassador Greg Schulte, briefed via Digital Video 
Conference (DVC) Chilean TV and radio commentators, think tank 
analysts, and university academics on the danger of Iran's nuclear 
program and the need for Iranian compliance with UN Security Council 
resolutions.  All Santiago leading newspapers gave prominent 
coverage to Ambassador Schulte's comments on November 21 with 
headlines such as: "No one Believes Iran's Nuclear Plan has Peaceful 
Objectives" and "U.S. Urges Chile and Latin American to Assume 'Key 
Role' in Iranian Nuclear Problem."  Headlines and excerpts follow. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2.  On November 21, conservative, influential newspaper-of-record El 
Mercurio (circ. 129,000) published a story on Iran's nuclear threat 
featuring Ambassador Greg Schulte, U.S. Permanent Representative to 
the IAEA, at a DVC in Embassy Santiago.  The headline read: 
"Ambassador Schulte: 'No one believes that Iran's nuclear plan is 
for peaceful purposes.'" 
The sub-headline read:  Schulte said Teheran's cooperation with the 
IAEA is not enough -- Chile and Latin America's role is to show Iran 
that this matter concerns the international community as a whole. 
 
¶3.  Ambassador Schulte said Teheran is not doing what is required 
for the IAEA to suspend sanctions.  "Iran's cooperation is selective 
and incomplete," he said.  "No one here in Vienna believes that Iran 
is developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes," said Schulte, 
noting that Teheran has established friendships with questionable 
countries such as Venezuela, Syria, and Cuba to deal with its 
international isolation.  Schulte also highlighted the unity of the 
international community on this matter and said that the differences 
between the United States with Russia and China on when and how to 
act do not undermine the overall effort to stop Iran's nuclear 
program.  "The good news is that a large number of countries are 
pursuing the same diplomatic goals.  The bad news is that we have 
not yet persuaded Iran's leaders to change direction." 
 
¶4.  On November 20, El Mercurio's on-line news service (EMOL) 
headline read:  U.S. Urges Chile and Latin American to Assume 'Key 
Role' in Iranian Nuclear Problem."  The article highlighted 
Ambassador's Schulte's remarks: "Chile and Latin American countries 
should communicate to Iran that this is an issue that concerns the 
international community, because everyone is interested in 
preventing a small arms race....  Iran should fully cooperate (with 
the AIEA), but we see selective cooperation....  No one in Vienna 
believes Iran's nuclear process is for peaceful means." 
 
¶5.  On November 21, business and financial "Diario Financiero" 
(circ. 30,000) headlined: "U.S seeks more allies against Iran's 
nuclear program."  Ambassador Schulte asked Chile and Latin America 
to play a key role with regard to Iran's nuclear program, expressing 
their concerns to Tehran.  In reference to the IAEA report submitted 
last week, the Ambassador said Iran's cooperation with the agency is 
"selective and incomplete" and added that Iran wants to make the 
nuclear program an issue between the United States and Teheran when 
it is an issue between Iran and the world.  Schulte also noted that 
Chilean Milenko Skoknic has been the agency's Board Chairman since 
September. 
 
¶6.  The government-owned, editorially-independent "La Nacion" (circ. 
4,200) headline on November 21 read: "U.S. wants Chile's support in 
dispute over Iran's nuclear program."
