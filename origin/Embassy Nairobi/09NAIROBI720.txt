SUBJECT:  SOMALIA - SOMALIA UNIT REQUESTS SUMMER TDYERS 
 
¶1. Post requests temporary duty (TDY) coverage for the Somalia Unit 
during the period June 2-26, August 17-31, and September 1-25 to 
allow the Unit's FSOs and their families to take R&R while 
maintaining the Unit's responsiveness and output.  A breakdown of 
specific days, needs and costs follows in para 3.  The press of the 
Unit's business, the need to respond quickly to likely breaking 
events, and significant and escalating interest in Somalia from 
Washington policymakers necessitates the Unit maintain full 
staffing, if possible. 
 
¶2. A TDY in the Somalia Unit is an excellent opportunity to refine 
your understanding of Somalia's and the region's political, 
counter-terror and development/humanitarian issues.  U.S. policy 
toward Somalia is constantly evolving, and interagency attention to 
this fascinating country has increased in recent months.  TDYers 
will interact with high level Somali officials, our international 
partners, and contribute to the Mission's interagency deliberations. 
 
 
¶3. NEEDS:  Coverage days and preferred skill set: 
 
-- June 2-26 and August 17-31:  For both periods we need a 
political/economic reporting officer with regional, security sector 
and/or counter-terrorism experience.  Working under supervision of 
the counselor, and with other Somali Unit officers, TDYers will: 
monitor and report on political, security and economic developments 
in Somalia; advise the ambassador and accompany him for meetings 
between the ambassador and high level Somali officials;  monitor and 
advance Somalia Unit and USAID efforts to deliver development and 
security sector assistance to the Somali government and people; 
attend donor coordination meetings; draft analysis of violent 
extremists' threats to the Transitional Federal Government; 
participate in Post's interagency discussions on piracy and monitor 
piracy trends; report on political events in Somaliland, especially 
progress toward elections in the Fall; meet with the Somali diaspora 
and business community; and manage the political LES. 
 
-- September 1-25:  A TDYer with public diplomacy/information 
officer experience.  Taking direction from the counselor, and in 
cooperation with the Unit's other staff, the officer will monitor 
open source Somali media; draft, clear and release Somalia unit 
media announcements as appropriate; manage grants, projects and 
events under development; advance ongoing outreach projects to the 
Somali diaspora and Somali community in Kenya; represent the Unit in 
interagency strategic communication coordination meetings; and 
supervise the PD LES.
