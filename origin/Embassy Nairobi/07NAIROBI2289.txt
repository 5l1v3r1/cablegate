¶1.  SUMMARY:  Studies show improved food security in 
south and central Somalia despite continuing conflict. 
Pastoralists and agro-pastoralists are showing signs of 
recovery. While the food security situation is also 
improving for riverine communities, this group remains 
particularly vulnerable to shocks.  USAID?s Office of US 
Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) continues to support 
monitoring of food security and nutrition in south and 
central Somalia and to work with partners to improve 
food security and livelihoods of vulnerable populations. 
Despite reported improvements in food security, many 
challenges still remain for Somalia.  End Summary. 
 
PASTORALISTS BEGIN RECOVERY 
 
¶2.  In FY 2006, USAID/OFDA provided $6.4 million to 
assist an estimated 1.4 million vulnerable communities 
affected by drought in south and central Somalia.  Since 
last year, the situation for these populations is 
improving (REFTEL). USAID-funded UN Food and 
Agriculture?s (FAO) Food Security Analysis Unit (FSAU) 
and Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) 
report an improved food security and agriculture outlook 
for pastoralists and agro-pastoralists. 
 
¶3.  FASU and FEWS NET also normal to above normal 
rainfall through May is expected to continue to 
replenish water sources and pasture and that 
agricultural activities are ongoing.  Due to a mild dry 
season and good long rains (April-June), livestock body 
conditions for all species (cattle, sheep, goat and 
camel) are improving, milk is available, and animals are 
reproducing.  In addition, livestock prices and exports 
have increased, improving purchasing power for 
pastoralists. 
 
¶4.  While malnutrition remains a chronic problem in 
south and central Somalia and Global Acute Malnutrition 
(GAM) rates have not gone below the WHO emergency 
threshold of 15 percent for the last 12 years, FSAU 
notes a slight improvement in malnutrition rates in some 
pastoralist areas.  Nutrition assessments conducted by 
FSAU and partners in Gedo Region in April 2007 indicate 
continuing critical malnutrition rates with 16.7 percent 
GAM reported in the agro-pastoral population and 19.9 
percent in the pastoral population.  A direct comparison 
cannot be made to last year?s assessment in March 2006, 
which showed a 23.7 percent GAM, as the study did not 
disaggregate by livelihood groups.  FSAU points out some 
recovery, however, and expects this improving trend to 
be similar in other pastoralist areas in south and 
central Somalia. 
 
RIVERINE COMMUNITIES 
 
¶5.  Despite early signs of improvement among 
pastoralists and agro-pastoralists, FSAU studies show 
that riverine communities remain highly vulnerable to 
shocks as this group was among the most affected by the 
November/December floods.  According to the UN, the 
flood displaced an estimated 255,000 people, 
representing more than 80 percent of the population 
along the Juba and Shabelle rivers.  Many lost their 
assets and crops.  Localized flooding during the current 
long rains could also negatively impact food security, 
especially in areas still recovering from previous 
flooding. 
 
¶6.  Nutrition assessments conducted by FSAU in Hiran 
Region in March 2007 targeting the riverine population 
show a GAM rate of 18.2 percent.  Assessments carried 
out in similar communities in Gedo Region in April 2007 
indicate a GAM rate of 17.7 percent.  These rates are 
consistent with previous years? assessments indicating 
no recovery for the riverine population in spite of the 
improved food security situation over the last year. 
Malnutrition rates are still above the recommended 
threshold because of persistent poverty, continuing

conflict, insecurity, limited access to water and 
healthcare, limited dietary diversity, poor sanitation, 
and increased exposure to water-borne diseases following 
recent flooding. 
 
¶7.  Following the floods, however, riverine communities 
have benefited from limited off-season crops in flood 
recessional areas.  FSAU forecasts agricultural 
production for the current season to be better compared 
to this time last year.  FSAU surveys indicate that 
ongoing planting, weeding, and further land preparation 
is creating more employment opportunities. 
 
USAID/OFDA ACTIVITIES 
 
¶8.  USAID/OFDA continues to support FSAU?s food security 
monitoring and ongoing nutritional assessments.  After 
the current long rains, FSAU, FEWS NET, and partners 
will conduct a long rains assessment which will provide 
vital information for planning and programming.  The 
results should be available in August.  In addition 
FSAU, through its nutrition surveillance unit (NSU), is 
conducting ongoing nutrition assessments including 
surveys specifically targeting IDP populations. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
¶9.  In spite of marginal improvements in food security, 
insecurity, piracy, political uncertainty and continual 
large-scale human displacement means Somalia?s worries 
are far from over.
