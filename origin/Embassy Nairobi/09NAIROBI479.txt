SUBJECT:  SOMALIA - Sharif Previews Government Reforms, Sharia Law 
Plans 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Ambassador spoke to Transitional Federal 
Government (TFG) President Sheikh Sharif in Nairobi at the beginning 
of Sharif's trip to Uganda and Burundi to thank those governments 
for their Africa Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) troop 
contributions.  He said integration of former ARS and TFG forces was 
progressing, but that the security situation was tenuous.  Sharif 
explained he was counseling peace and not responding to extremists' 
provocations, and that the public was behind him.  To raise tax 
revenue, Sharif highlighted planned reforms at the air and sea 
ports, as well as a commission to discourage public corruption.  He 
told the Ambassador he envisioned a moderate version of Sharia law, 
designed to blunt extremists' criticisms of his Islamic bona fides. 
He told us Kenyan President Kibaki had welcomed him warmly and 
pledged support.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) The Ambassador spoke to TFG President Sheikh Sharif during 
his stop in Nairobi March 10.  Sharif is traveling to Kenya, Burundi 
and Uganda to consult with regional leaders and thank the latter two 
countries for their contributions to the Africa Union Mission to 
Somalia stabilization force. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Ambassador Ranneberger commended Sharif on naming a 
moderate government and reiterated U.S. support for the TFG.  The 
Ambassador encouraged Sharif to bring reform and accountability to 
the government, and focus on capturing new sources of revenue to 
fund the TFG.  The Ambassador briefed President Sharif on on-going 
U.S. development and humanitarian assistance and on the state of the 
$5 million to support formation of a joint security force.  The 
Ambassador acknowledged extremists' pressure on the government to 
implement Sharia law, but urged against radical versions of Sharia. 
 
 
¶4.  (U) President Sharif thanked the United States for its political 
support thus far, and previewed some of his government's initiatives 
to improve revenue collection.  Sharif said his government is 
planning key changes at the air and sea ports to raise money for a 
TFG budget, the details of which are being finalized. He is also 
forming an anti-corruption commission to root out theft by 
government officials.  Sharif said that in two to three weeks the 
TFG's financial situation will be critical, especially in the 
security sector.  While the TFG hopes to improve revenue collection, 
Sharif said he is asking internationals, including at a gathering of 
EU country ambassadors to Kenya, for budget support. 
 
¶5.  (U) Sharif said he still enjoys public support in Mogadishu, 
which has translated into popular pressure against violence.  For 
his part, Sharif said he has been counseling peace, and avoiding 
spoilers' violent provocations.  Sharif said there has been progress 
integrating former ARS with TFG forces, but again reiterated his 
need for security assistance. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) President Sharif acknowledged our concerns about 
implementing extreme Islamic law.  Testing President Sharif's sense 
of humor, the Ambassador urged Sharif not to undertake any 
"amputations or stonings."  Sharif and his entourage broke into 
almost hysterical laughter.  Sharif responded that, should the 
Ambassador visit Mogadishu, he would be in no danger of losing "a 
hand, a finger or so much as a fingernail."  Sharif reminded us that 
the former Islamic Courts had never introduced such extreme Sharia 
law, and stated categorically that he would not do so. 
Sharif explained that his announcement of Sharia law was meant to 
blunt extremists' criticism of his Islamic credentials.  Sharif said 
that first the Transitional Federal Charter, and ultimately the will 
of the Somali people will determine the nature of the Somali legal 
system.  (Note: the Charter references Sharia law as the basis for 
national legislation. End Note.). 
 
¶7.  (U) Sharif shared with us some information about his discussions 
with Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki.  Sharif said Kibaki had received 
him warmly, and pledged to support the TFG.  Post has subsequently 
learned that the Kenyans provided a formal head-of-state welcome to 
Sharif at the airport, in contrast to the low-key reception former 
President Abdullahi Yusuf always received.  Sharif said Kibaki and 
he discussed the insecurity along the Somali-Kenyan border, agreed 
on the need for a joint committee on border security, and resolved 
to better use a 2008 agreement on public sector exchanges and 
training.  Sharif said Kibaki asked for a follow-on meeting during 
Sharif's scheduled Nairobi layover March 13 or 14.
