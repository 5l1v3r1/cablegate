SUBJECT: Somalia - Transitional Parliament Re-convenes After 
Three-Month Recess 
 
¶1.       (SBU) Summary:  On December 21, the Somalia Transitional 
Federal Parliament (TFP) kicked off its tenth session following a 
three-month recess.  Transitional Federal Government (TFG) 
President Sharif opened the TFP with a well-received speech that 
focused on security and urged the administrations of Puntland and 
Somaliland to join forces with the TFG in the fight against 
"al-Qaeda" threats.  President Sharif also highlighted TFG progress 
in reforming and training its security forces, appointing a new 
chief justice as well as a governor for Banadir region, and 
replacing the heads of the TFG police and military.  285 of the 
TFP's 550 deputies were in attendance.  Mortar attacks by 
al-Shabaab did not succeed in interrupting the session.  End 
summary. 
 
 
 
¶2.       (SBU) On December 21, the Somalia Transitional Federal 
Parliament (TFP) re-convened in Mogadishu following a three-month 
recess.  Only 285 of the 550 TFP deputies were in attendance. 
(Note:  About 385 MPs had been regularly present during the TFP's 
previous session.  As estimated one hundred of the absent MPs are 
reported to be in Nairobi.)  In his opening remarks TFP Speaker 
Madobe urged those absent to return to Mogadishu.  The Speaker took 
note of unhappiness among the MPs over the inability of the TFG to 
regularly pay their salaries.  (Note:  The MPs were last paid by 
the TFG in November, but have received salaries for only four 
months since January.  UNDP had paid salaries until the TFG assumed 
responsibility.  The doubling in the size of the TFP with the 
January 2009 TFG - Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia merger 
and the large salaries that the MPs receive --$1200/month-have 
complicated efforts to pay them regularly.  End note.) 
 
 
 
¶3.       (SBU) TFG President Sharif, dressed in military fatigues, 
opened the tenth session by calling on the MPs to back the TFG 
security forces' efforts to defeat "terrorist groups opposed to the 
TFG."  Addressing the security threat, Sharif said, was his 
government's top priority and the TFG security forces were 
militarily able to defeat its enemies.  He urged the Puntland and 
Somaliland administrations to join forces with the TFG in fighting 
threats from "al-Qaeda." 
 
 
 
¶4.       (SBU) Sharif highlighted to the MPs his government's 
progress in recruiting and training TFG security forces, as well as 
in streamlining their chain-of-command.  Sharif also assured the 
MPs that the international community was firmly behind the TFG, and 
that the Somali people backed the government.  Among the positive 
steps taken by the TFG, Sharif said, were the appointment of a 
chief justice and a new governor for the Banadir region.  The 
President also highlighted the replacement of the head of the armed 
forces and the chief of police. 
 
 
 
¶5.       (SBU) Although he had assured the MPs of the international 
community's support, Sharif lamented the fact that some pledges 
made at the Brussels International Contact Group meeting remained 
unfulfilled.  He urged that the international community "fulfill 
its pledges to the Somali people, who are currently confronting 
brutal radicals intent on de-stabilizing not only Somalia, but the 
entire region." 
 
 
 
¶6.       (SBU) Although the speech was generally upbeat, Sharif 
admitted that the TFG had made mistakes, and invited the TFP to 
debate its performance during its sessions.  Sharif's invitation 
sparked the most commentary among Somali contacts in Nairobi.  Some 
saw in it an effort by the President to use criticism by the 
Parliament as leverage in his on-going efforts to re-configure the 
Cabinet.  Others, including the President's Chief-of-Staff, told us 
that the President's intention was to urge the Parliament not to 
take its complaints about the government to foreign capitals.

¶7.       (SBU) On the agenda for the TFP in its tenth session is 
the 2010 TFG budget, the constitutional process, and a debate on 
the TFG's performance since it came to power almost one year ago. 
With a nod to that impending debate Sharif, in his remarks, urged 
MPs to act responsibly. 
 
 
 
¶8.       (SBU) As has been the case with past sessions, the TFP met 
in the Banadir Federal offices for reasons of security.  The media 
reported that armed opposition forces attempted to disrupt the 
TFP's work by lobbing mortars at the building while Parliament was 
in session. 
 
 
 
¶9.       (SBU) Comment:  Although the number of MPs in attendance 
was significantly down, it is noteworthy that a core group of 
transitional institution members brave very dangerous conditions, 
as witnessed by the December 3 suicide bombing that claimed the 
lives of three TFG ministers, in order to advance the Djibouti 
peace process.  Somalia Unit is urging those MPs who remain in 
Nairobi to join their colleagues in Mogadishu.
