(SBU) Summary:  Following a series of telephone conversations 
with Puntland Administration officials (reftel), the Puntland 
Ministry of Information and Telecommunications on October 9 
permitted VOA Somalia Service to resume broadcasting.  (Note: 
 The Administration on October 1 had ordered Puntland FM 
radio stations not to transmit VOA Somalia Service 
broadcasts.)  The Puntland Administration nevertheless 
continued to insist that its complaints of biased coverage by 
VOA Somalia Service remained and asked that the Somalia 
Service's reporting be investigated.  Somalia Unit's 
Somali-speaking staff has verified that VOA Somalia Service 
resumed broadcasting as of October 9.
