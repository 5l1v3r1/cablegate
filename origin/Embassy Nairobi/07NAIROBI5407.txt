REF: 06STATE 90734 
 
¶1. A variety of reporting indicates that there are a 
significant number of U.S. citizens in Somalia (particularly 
in Mogadishu), although we have no reliable statistics.  Our 
clear impression is that most are duel nationals.  A number 
of Amcits are in parliament and/or are players elsewhere on 
the national scene. 
 
¶2. As the current situation in Somalia has unfolded, only 3 
American citizens in Mogadishu have contacted us for 
assistance and we received only one welfare/whereabouts call. 
 All had Somali surnames. 
 
¶3. We have made clear to TFG Foreign Minister Hurre that we 
hold the TFG responsible to help ensure the security of 
American citizens, regardless of their political views, and 
that we would want to be informed immediately regarding any 
arrests of American citizens.  We requested Embassy Addis to 
inform the Ethiopian authorities that, given their ongoing 
military intervention, we expect them to help ensure the 
safety of American citizens as well.  Our current Travel 
Warning on Somalia (reftel) for some time has made it clear 
that Amcits are advised the USG cannot provide services to 
Amcits in Somalia and that there is no US Embassy or other US 
diplomatic presence there.
