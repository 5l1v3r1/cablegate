Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The week of November 24 witnessed two incidents of apparent 
media harassment in Somalia.  Early in the week, the Director of 
Warsan Radio was arrested by Transitional Federal Government (TFG) 
forces for "giving out misleading information about the TFG."  The 
charges appear to stem from coverage of the execution of a person 
accused of murdering a TFG official.  Later in the week, journalists 
from Universal TV were arrested by TFG police in Mogadishu, 
reportedly for having broadcast unfavorable coverage of the security 
situation there.  Post is investigating both incidents and has 
registered concern with TFG leadership.  End summary.

Arrests in Baidoa 
----------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 25, the director of Warsan Radio, Hilal Sheik 
Shuayb, was arrested by TFG forces in Baidoa on charges of 
broadcasting misleading information about the TFG.  The station was 
said to have carried a live report on November 25 regarding a TFG 
military court's execution of a man accused of taking part in the 
recent killing of the most senior TFG military commander in Baidoa. 
Our contacts indicate the TFG authorities in Baidoa did not approve 
of the station's broadcast of a report that the suspect was executed 
immediately following a military court ruling.  Shuayb was held 
overnight.  The station was not shut down in conjunction with this 
arrest. 
 
¶3. (SBU) After Shuayb's release the following day, Hindia Haji 
Mohamed of Warsan Radio and Muktar Mohamed Atosh of Radio Jubba (and 
who also reportedly works for VOA in some capacity, likely as a 
stringer) were arrested by TFG police.  The police reportedly 
arrested the two on charges that they "did not use correct wording" 
while reporting on the same execution case.  Sources tell us the 
journalists avoided the word "murderer" to describe the executed 
person, which the TFG police reportedly interpreted as using "soft 
language" in reporting on the killing of the senior TFG official.

Harassment of Universal TV Staff 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Late in the same week, a group of local reporters for the 
London-based Universal TV was arrested in Mogadishu.  A contact at 
Shabelle Media, which reported on the incident, told us the arrest 
was carried out by a former militia group-turned police force who 
are known for arbitrary arrests with no clear instruction from their 
seniors.  The journalists were held briefly at Mogadishu's Wadajir 
District station and had their equipment confiscated, but were later 
released after intervention by the District Officer, Ahmed Dai.  The 
police officers accused the journalists of bias in their reporting 
of the current situation in Mogadishu.  The Shabelle contact said 
this kind of complaint is not unusual as many news reports are bound 
to be objectionable to either the TFG or the opposition.

Post Actions

¶5. (SBU) As has been our practice in cases like these, we have 
contacted the stations and, where possible, the reporters involved 
in the cases.  In addition, we have contacted the TFG's Minister of 
Information to inquire about the facts of the incidents and to 
register our concern.  The Minister, who also serves as Deputy Prime 
Minister and who is currently heavily involved in the Djibouti 
process, has not replied to date, but we expect a response soon.
