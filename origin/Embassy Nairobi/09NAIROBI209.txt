SUBJECT: PRESIDENT SUPPORTS COORDINATION CENTER ON PIRACY 
 
REF: 2008 NAIROBI 2869 
 
 
¶1. During the Ambassador's meeting with President Kibaki on 
January 27, the President expressed strong interest in having 
a coordination center established in Kenya as a "headquarters 
unit" for the Contact Group on Somali Piracy (CGSP).  Post 
understands the concept of a coordination center was advanced 
by the U.S. delegation informally at the initial meeting of 
the Contract Group on Somali Piracy in New York in early 
January, and that initial reactions from some regional states 
have been positive. 
 
¶2. Kenya's recent signing of MOUs on piracy with the UK and 
U.S., its demonstrated willingness to take possession of, 
prosecute, and punish captured pirates (the late-2008 and 
still ongoing in the courts British case of eight suspected 
pirates, Ref A; and, the 2006 case when the U.S. Navy handed 
over ten pirates who were prosecuted, convicted, and 
imprisoned), its strategic location, its initiatives to exert 
leadership in the region on piracy, and the U.S. military's 
strong liaison relationships with Kenya, all make Kenya a 
logical choice for basing a CGSP multinational coordination 
effort on counter-piracy. 
 
¶3. The President shared his concerns about Somali piracy in 
the presence of Foreign Minister Wetangula, who the President 
has directed to make Somali piracy a higher priority issue. 
The GOK recognizes fully the national interest at stake -- 
the economic costs are huge as pirates threaten its shipping 
lanes and the viability of the port of Mombasa -- and it has 
demonstrated the political will to engage actively on 
counter-piracy efforts.  Post supports the GOK's initiative 
to play a greater role on Somali piracy, to include its 
hosting a central coordination office.
