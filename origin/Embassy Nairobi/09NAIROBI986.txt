U.S. Denounces Violence, Supports TFG 
 
The Government of the United States condemns the recent attacks on 
the Transitional Federal Government in Mogadishu that have forced 
thousands of Somalis from their homes.  The extremists who are 
instigating these attacks have no regard for the well-being of 
Somalis, and are undermining the peaceful efforts of the legitimate 
government to further national reconciliation. 
 
The United States is particularly disturbed at reports that foreign 
fighters and those who rejected dialogue in 2006 are participating 
in this effort to forcibly remove a legitimate Somali government 
from power.  The United States, in concert with the international 
community, strongly supports President Sharif and the TFG, and 
commends the important progress the TFG has made in the past several 
months.
