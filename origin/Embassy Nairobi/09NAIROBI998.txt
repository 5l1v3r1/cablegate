Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On May 3, ironically World Press Freedom Day, the 
Transitional Federal Government's (TFG) Minister of 
Information abruptly dissolved Somalia's National Media 
Council (NMC), charged with advocating for journalists in the 
development of Somalia's media law.  The Minister told us the 
NMC "existed only in name and has been out of touch" and 
noted that the group had never been approved by the President 
of the TFG (reftel).  The NMC issued a statement protesting 
the move, while journalists appear divided on the issue.  End 
summary.

Media Group Dissolved 
on Press Freedom Day 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Farahan Ali Mohamed, the Transitional Federal 
Government's (TFG) new Minister of Information, dissolved the 
National Media Council (NMC) during a May 3 event 
commemorating World Press Freedom Day.  The NMC had been 
charged with advocating for journalists during the 
development of Somalia's media law (reftel).  Mohamed told us 
he dissolved the NMC, an advocacy association formed as 
called for in the draft media law, because it "existed only 
in name and has been out of touch" and noted that the group 
had never been approved by the President.  Journalist 
associations including the Associated Somali Journalists 
(ASOJ) and the National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ) 
commended the move, stating that the NMC had been usurped by 
journalists promoting their own agendas at the expense of 
Somali journalists at large.  The minister told us he intends 
to redraft the media law entirely, and the dissolution of the 
NMC was simply a "precursor" to that effort. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The NMC issued its own statement, claiming that the 
dissolution was "illegal" and represented the government's 
interference in an independent organization.  The group 
claimed the minister interfered with Article 19 of the 
Transitional Federal Charter (TFC) in dissolving the NMC. 
(Note: Article 19 refers to the right to assemble.  End note.)

Comment 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) We inquired with Mohamed immediately upon hearing 
this news, and he replied immediately with remarks very 
similar to those in the statements by ASOJ and NUSOJ.  While 
we are not certain of the groups' involvement in the 
dissolution of the NMC, the disagreement among journalist 
groups is perhaps another reflection of the often disparate 
agendas of journalist associations, which disagree, fracture, 
and reinvent themselves on a regular basis.  We will engage 
thQinister, who is planning to pass through Nairobi soon, 
very directly on this issue, emphasizing the importance we 
place on a free and vibrant press as part of Somalia's 
rebuilding process.  End comment.
