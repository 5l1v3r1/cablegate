Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per ref B, Post submits the following update for the 
first week of October 2009.  End Summary. 
 
------------- 
PD Activities 
------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Somalia Unit, including the Military Information 
Support Team (MIST) dedicated to Somalia, performed para. 3-5 
activities since the last report: 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ambassador Ranneberger did an on-the-record 
interview with Radio Shabelle on September 9.  This interview 
marked a renewal of Somali media's engagement with the U.S. 
government after a long period of hesitancy due to real and 
perceived threats from extremist elements in Somalia. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On September 22, Ambassador Ranneberger visited 
Nairobi's Aga Khan Hospital to pay respects to African Union 
Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) troops injured in the September 
17 dual suicide bombing in Mogadishu.  The Ambassador 
conducted a press conference outside the hospital in which he 
reiterated our regret at the bombing and affirmed U.S. 
support for the Transitional Federal Government, AMISOM, and 
the ongoing rebuilding process.  The event received wide and 
positive media coverage. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Somalia Unit co-authored a statement, released as a 
joint statement among the European Union, Inter Governmental 
authority on Development, League of Arab States, United 
Nations, Norway and the U.S, condemning the September 17 
suicide bombings. 
 
¶6. (SBU) On October 1, the regional Government of Puntland, 
in two separate edicts, banned FM radio stations in Puntland 
from carrying Voice of America's (VOA) Somali Service and 
banned journalists from carrying out their work for VOA.  The 
suspension remains in effect as of mid-day October 6.  Post 
is engaged with the Government of Puntland in an effort to 
reverse the suspension. 
 
¶7. (SBU) MIST activity: The MIST has continued broadcasting a 
youth drama that emphasizes the needs for peace and support 
for the TFG.  This program was broadcast in six locations 
throughout Puntland and central Somali as well as another 
location in Mogadishu.  The same program is broadcasting 
throughout Kenya,s Northeastern Province and Eastleigh 
neighborhood of Nairobi.  The MIST has also continued 
broadcasting a series of lectures by a local sheikh who 
advocates the need for tolerance and uses Islamic doctrine to 
refute the justifications offered by extremist organizations. 
 This program, broadcast in six locations throughout Puntland 
and central Somalia as well as Mogadishu, complements the 
ongoing program broadcast throughout Kenya,s Northeastern 
Province and Eastleigh neighborhood of Nairobi. 
 
¶8. (SBU) MIST activity (cont.): The MIST continues planning 
for comics and CDs that will supplement the recently aired 
youth drama series.  The team also continues planning for 
print products that will support the TFG and condemn the 
extremists.  These products will be distributed throughout 
Puntland, Kenya's Northeastern Province, Mogadishu, and 
Eastleigh.  Finally, the MIST has begun a campaign in the 
Dadaab refugee camps that uses a local musical/drama group to 
engage Somali youth.  The second concert is scheduled to be 
held at the end of this month.
