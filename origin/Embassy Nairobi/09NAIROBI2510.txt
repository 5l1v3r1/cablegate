Information for six months of satellite and Internet service, 
focused particularly on expanding the reach of the newly-revamped 
Radio Mogadishu.  These funds will be disbursed via the Price 
Waterhouse Coopers mechanism, which allows an increased level of 
coordination and accountability for donor funds.  The Minister of 
Information has expressed gratitude to the USG for this 
demonstration of direct support to his operation, the first of its 
kind among the international community.  We remain engaged with an 
international group focused on coordinating our assistance to the 
TFG's outreach efforts as well as Somali media.  Post thanks 
AF/PDPA for enabling us to provide this crucial assistance to the 
TFG.

first of three issues in a comic book series.  The series will 
convey messages of peace and support to the TFG while condemning

Eastern Province and Nairobi's Eastleigh neighborhood.
