REF: STATE 41602 
 
¶1.  (U) POLOFF delivered REF invitation to CENTCOM conference 
on Iraq to Azerbaijani MFA Americas Desk on April 3.  MFA 
officer queried if the conference was funded, and POLOFF 
noted that it was not.  As such, the MFA officer advised that 
given the lack of funding, it was unlikely that the MFA would 
send a representative, but he would look into it. 
 
¶2.  (U) The Defense Attache office has delivered the same 
invitation separately to the Ministry of Defense.
