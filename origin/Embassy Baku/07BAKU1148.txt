¶2.  Accommodations:  Reservations have been made for Ms. 
Lurie at the Park Hyatt Hotel. 
 
¶3.  Visas:  All travelers are advised to obtain visas for 
all/all stops on their itinerary prior to their departure. 
We recommend that travelers obtain Azerbaijan visas from the 
Embassy of Azerbaijan at the point of origin, and that they 
allow 10 days for processing of the visa request.  If visas 
cannot be obtained at the traveler's point of origin, an 
airport visa can be issued upon arrival.  Please proof read 
your visa carefully.  An occasional Embassy guest has 
received a visa with an error in it.  If traveling on a 
Diplomatic Passport there is no fee.  If traveling on tourist 
or official passports, there is a dollars 40 fee for a single 
entry visa.  Default validity is 7 days, but 30 day validity 
is available on request.  Passport assistance is available at 
the passport counter in room 1258 of the State Department. 
The Embassy of Azerbaijan requires a minimum of two working 
days to process visa requests.  Should the projected 
itinerary include transit through Turkey, visitors must 
obtain Turkish visas in advance.  Bearers of Diplomatic or 
Official Passports are not permitted to purchase airport 
visas in Turkey and will be denied exit from the Istanbul 
airport.  If transit through Russia is necessary, travelers 
must obtain transit visas in advance. 
 
¶4.  Travel advisory:  None. 
 
¶5.  Web site:  Useful information for all travelers is 
available on the internet at http://baku.usembassy.gov. 
Follow links for consular services: traveling to Azerbaijan. 
 
¶6.  General reminders: 
 
--bring sufficient cash to pay for all expenses except 
lodging.  Credit cards are still accepted only by businesses 
that cater to foreigners, such as hotels, travel agencies, 
international airlines and a few restaurants. 
 
--the Embassy has a CIRRUS/Plus network ATM machine, which 
accepts most U.S. bank cards.  It dispenses both the local 
currency (Azerbaijani manat) and U.S. dollars. 
 
--bring supplies of all hard-to-find foods, toiletries and 
medicines.  Western commodities are sold in Baku but are 
expensive and not always available. 
 
--drink only bottled water;  tap water is not potable. 
 
¶7.  Security:  Crime in Baku is comparable with that of major 
U.S. cities.  Visitors should exercise caution, avoid walking 
alone after dark, and be aware of their surroundings at all 
times.  Street crime includes pickpockets, jewelry snatching 
and armed robbery.  If confronted, no resistance should be 
given and valuables should be surrendered.  Medical 
facilities are limited in dealing with major trauma care. 
Visitors should keep their passports or a copy with them at 
all times.  Counterfeit U.S. dollars are often passed in 
Baku.  Visitors should exchange money only at the major banks 
and hotels, or at the Embassy cashier. 
 
¶8.  Security clearance level:  All visitors who require 
access to cleared areas and "no escort" ID badges must 
provide proof of their security clearance by front channel 
cable. 
 
¶9. Meet and Assist:  Embassy Baku will meet Ms. Lurie at the 
airport, provide transportation during the visit, and provide 
transportation to the airport for her departure.
