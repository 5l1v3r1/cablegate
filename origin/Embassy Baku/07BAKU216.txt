¶2.  Accommodations:  Reservations have been made for CODEL 
Ortiz at the Park Hyatt.  The Hyatt's address is 1 Bakikhanov 
St, Baku; telephone number is (994) (12) 490-1234; fax number 
is (994) (12) 498-7878.  The hotel's daily rate is $218.00 
USD without VAT and includes breakfast.  Please note that 
cancellation or amendment of a confirmed reservation must be 
done 48 hours prior to arrival.  Failure to do so will result 
in a one-night cancellation fee. 
 
¶3.  Visas:  All travelers are advised to obtain visas for 
all/all stops on their itinerary prior to their departure. 
We recommend that travelers obtain Azerbaijani visas from the 
Embassy of Azerbaijan at the point of origin, and that they 
allow 10 days for processing of the visa request.  If visas 
cannot be obtained at the traveler's point of origin, an 
airport visa can be issued upon arrival.  Please proof read 
your visa carefully.  An occasional Embassy guest has 
received a visa with an error in it.  If traveling on a 
Diplomatic Passport, there is no fee.  If traveling on 
tourist or official passports, there is a $40 USD fee for a 
single entry one-month visa.  Passport assistance is 
available at the passport counter in room 1258 of the State 
Department.  The Embassy of Azerbaijan requires a minimum of 
two working days to process visa requests.  Should the 
projected itinerary include transit through Turkey, visitors 
must obtain Turkish visas in advance.  Bearers of Diplomatic 
or Official Passports are not permitted to purchase airport 
visas in Turkey and will be denied exit from the Istanbul 
airport.  If transit through Russia is necessary, travelers 
must obtain transit visas in advance. 
 
¶4.  Travel advisory:  Travelers are also advised that the 
alternate landing site for BA flight London-Baku is Tbilisi, 
Georgia.  The alternate landing site would be used only in 
situations which prohibit landing at Baku Heydar Aliyev 
International Airport. 
 
¶5.  Web site:  Useful information for all travelers is 
available on the Internet at http://baku.usembassy.gov. 
Follow the links for consular services: traveling to 
Azerbaijan. 
 
¶6.  General reminders: 
 
--bring sufficient cash to pay for all expenses except 
lodging.  Credit cards are still accepted only by businesses 
that cater to foreigners, such as hotels, travel agencies, 
international airlines and a few restaurants. 
 
--the Embassy has a CIRRUS/Plus network ATM machine, which 
accepts most U.S. bank cards.  It dispenses both the local 
currency (Azerbaijani manat) and U.S. dollars. 
 
--bring supplies of all hard-to-find foods, toiletries and 
medicines.  Western commodities are sold in Baku but are 
expensive and not always available. 
 
--drink only bottled water;  tap water is not potable. 
 
¶7.  Security:  Crime in Baku is comparable with that of major 
U.S. cities.  Visitors should exercise caution, avoid walking 
alone after dark, and be aware of their surroundings at all 
times.  Street crime includes pickpockets, jewelry snatching 
and armed robbery.  If confronted, no resistance should be 
given and valuables should be surrendered.  Medical 
facilities are limited in dealing with major trauma care. 
Visitors should keep their passports or a copy with them at 
all times.  Counterfeit U.S. dollars are often passed in 
Baku.  Visitors should exchange money only at major banks and 
hotels, or at the Embassy cashier. 
 
¶8.  Security clearance level:  All visitors who require 
access to cleared areas and "no escort" ID badges must 
provide proof of their security clearance by front channel 
cable. 
 
¶9.  Meet and Assist:  Embassy Baku will meet CODEL Ortiz at 
the airport, provide transportation during the visit, and 
provide transportation to the airport for departure.
