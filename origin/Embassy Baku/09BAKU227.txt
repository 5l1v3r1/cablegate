 ¶1.  (SBU) On Tuesday, March 10 Azerbaijan President Ilham 
Aliyev visited Tehran to formally hand-over the revolving 
Presidency of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) to 
incoming President Mahmud Ahmedinejad, and to participate in 
the ECO summit.  Heads of State from Turkey, Turkmenistan, 
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan also attended the 
meeting of this regional organization. 
 
ECO of Empty Talk 
----------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) While in Tehran, Aliyev and the other heads of state 
held separate bilateral meetings with Supreme Leader Khameini 
and President Ahmadinejad.  The visit was treated as a "low 
profile" event by the Azerbaijani press, and both press and 
official GOAJ sources suggest that little of substance 
transpired.  Former GOAJ National Security Advisor Vafa 
Guluzadeh told Iran watcher that the whole visit was little 
more than an "empty show."  He said that Ahmadinejad and 
Khameini both spoke of assisting Azerbaijan in resolving its 
issues with Armenia, "and Ilham pretended to take them 
seriously."  In reality, he claimed, the GOAJ is well aware 
that Iran has no meaningful political influence in Armenia, 
which he claimed "looks completely to Russia."  Guluzadeh, a 
veteran of many ECO summits, called the organization a 
"useless talk shop." 
 
Alborz Rig Deployment 
--------------------- 
 
¶3.  (S) In a March 13 meeting with Ambassador (ref a), a 
seemingly frustrated GOAJ Foreign Minister Mammadyarov noted 
that no progress was made with Iran on the Caspian 
delimitation issue during the visit.  Mammadyarov did report 
that he received new assurances from Iranian Foreign Minister 
Mottaki that the Iranian semi-submersible Alborz oil 
exploration rig, now undergoing testing outside the Iranian 
port of Neka, will not be deployed in disputed waters, but 
"just outside."  Mammadyarov said that he warned Mottaki to 
keep the rig out of Azerbaijan-claimed waters. 
 
¶4.  (C) Embassy Acting DCM has requested an explicit debrief 
from the Foreign Ministry on the President's Iran visit and 
related issues.
