REF: A. STATE 5792 
     Â¶B. TEL AVIV 407 
 
 In accordance with Reftel A instructions, Embassy Army 
Attache obtained the following information from General-Major 
Ramiz Najafov, Head of the Department for International 
Cooperation and Euro-Atlantic Integration at the Azerbaijan 
MOD: 
 
- The exact type and quantity of USML items cited in Ref A 
are correct, and there is no reason to believe their end use 
will anything besides the purpose stated in Reftel A. 
However, Gen. Najafov verbally confirmed the transaction but 
refused to disclose documentation of the purchase, arguing 
that since the purchase is from an Israeli rather than a U.S. 
source there is no obligation for him to disclose any details 
to the USG, despite extensive and repeated explanations of 
the U.S. nexus in the transaction and the legal basis and 
rationale for pre-license checks. 
- Embassy acquired no information to contradict Reftel B on 
other questions relating to the business relationship between 
Elbit systems and the Azerbaijan MOD.
