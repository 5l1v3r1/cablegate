¶1. (U) In recent statements - notably on widely watched 
independent ANS Television - outspoken Iranian Ambassador to 
Azerbaijan Afshar Suleymani repeatedly accused Israel of 
using excessive force and criticized the United States for 
its support of this "injustice" in the conflict between 
Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.  Suleymani dismissed all 
claims that Iran has provided Hezbollah with weapons or 
technical support, claims he says are being used to create 
the impression that Hezbollah is supported only by Iran 
(Sueymani claims Hezbollah is supported only by God ad the 
Lebanese people).  Furthermore, he repeatedy asserted that 
Israel is attempting to exploit he situation in Lebanon - 
with the full support f the U.S. - in order to exert 
pressure on Iran nd its nuclear program.  Suleymani called 
upon al Muslims to resist the "Zionists" and to condemn 
America's support for Israel's offensive.  As always, 
Suleymani, an ethnic Azeri, made all of these remarks in 
fluent Azerbaijani. 
 
¶2. (U) During a 21 July appearance on ANS Television, 
Suleymani went out of his way to stress Iranian and 
Azerbaijani "brotherhood and friendship," a theme throughout 
this crisis.  When asked to comment on a hypothetical 
question posed by Israeli Ambassador Artur Lenk concerning 
what Azerbaijan would do if Iran attacked Lenkoran (a 
southern Azerbaijani city near the Iranian frontier), 
Suleymani said "Iran and Azerbaijan are friends and 
brothers...we are neighbors..let them not create such 
disagreements between us." 
 
¶3. (U) Suleymani used a August 14 appearance on ANS 
Television not only to repeatedly criticize Israel and the 
U.S. over Lebanon (despite the recently implemented cease 
fire between Israel and Hezbollah), but to threaten further 
instability in the region.  Asked whether or not he thought 
the Middle East crisis was over, Suleymani stated that it 
would not be concluded soon and threatened that "new 
conflicts could easily emerge."  When asked to elaborate on 
this point, Suleymani avoided the question and returned to 
his previous calls for Muslim solidarity in the face of U.S. 
and Israeli attempts to "oppress" the Islamic World. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT: Suleymani actively engages the local press, 
utilizing his fluent Azerbaijani, in order to get out the 
Iranian message.  He has been more active than usual in 
recent weeks, and his comments have closely mirrored those 
made by Iranian President Ahmadinejad.  Other points of view 
on the conflict - including our own and those of the Israeli 
Ambassador to Azerbaijan - have also received wide airing in 
the Azerbaijani media.  While Suleymani may be trying to stir 
up anti-U.S. feelings in the context of the Israel-Hezbollah 
conflict, we have not seen evidence that his efforts have 
been successful.  Post will continue to monitor closely 
public reaction to the Middle East crisis.  END COMMENT.
