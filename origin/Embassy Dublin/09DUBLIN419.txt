¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  The Speaker of the Irish Parliament's sudden 
resignation on October 6 has highlighted voters' growing 
dissatisfaction with an often unaccountable political class 
and the perks it allows itself.  Having clearly underscored 
malfeasance by the principal governing party Fianna Fail (FF) 
in calling for O'Donoghue's resignation, the opposition might 
be positioning itself to force early elections sometime 
between now and next spring.  All of this comes just days 
before an already uncertain October 10 vote of the Greens 
(septel), the junior coalition partner, on whether to approve 
a new Program for Government.  END SUMMARY.

A SUDDEN RESIGNATION 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) An unexpected confrontation in the Irish parliament 
(Dail) led on October 6 to the resignation of the Speaker of 
the Dail John O'Donoghue.  O'Donoghue had been under 
increasing fire for several weeks after reports surfaced of 
his lavish foreign travel and other expenses he racked up as 
Minister for Art, Sport and Tourism from 2002-07.  Observers 
believed O'Donoghue would weather that storm, but his 
situation quickly deteriorated after the disclosure, over the 
weekend of October 3-4, that his expenses as Speaker were 
similarly lavish.  In a surprise statement during the October 
6 session of the Dail, Labour leader Eamon Gilmore confronted 
O'Donoghue, who was presiding over the session, calling for 
his resignation.  This was quickly followed by a similar 
statement by Enda Kenny, the leader of Fine Gael, the 
principal opposition party.  Reportedly the Greens, the 
junior partner in the governing coalition, refused a request 
from Fianna Fail (FF), the principal governing party of which 
O'Donoghue is a member, to support slower, more discreet 
deliberations on O'Donoghue's fate.  Late on the night of 
October 6, O'Donoghue announced his resignation, effective at 
an as yet unspecified time next week. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
SPEAKER RESIGNATION NOT THE ONLY DUST-UP 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The resignation comes on top of an ongoing dust-up 
surrounding a severance package of over one million euros for 
FF member Rody Molloy, the Director General of the National 
Training and Employment Authority (Fas).  When he resigned in 
disgrace after an investigation revealed numerous financial 
irregularities, Mary Coughlan, Vice Prime Minister and 
Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, granted him 
the generous severance package.  Coughlan and Prime Minister 
Brian Cowen claim such a package is justified and is standard 
practice, but media and opposition are attacking the Fas 
affair -- as well as the O'Donoghue scandal -- as typical of 
a systemically corrupt government irresponsibly wasting 
taxpayer money. 
 
--------------------------------- 
COMMENT: EARLY ELECTIONS POSSIBLE 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) O'Donoghue's resignation -- especially coupled with 
the Fas affair -- is a sign of the continuing vulnerability 
of an unpopular government, despite the recent landslide vote 
in favor of the EU Lisbon Treaty (reftel).  It could add to 
the misgivings of many Green party members about remaining 
junior partners in the governing coalition, just days ahead 
of the October 10 Greens convention at which the new Program 
for Government will require two-thirds approval.  With the 
leader of Labour, the third strongest party in the Dail, 
having precipitated O'Donoghue's fall, and Fine Gael having 
quickly driven the final nail in the coffin, a strengthened 
opposition might be positioning itself to force early 
elections sometime between now and next spring.  By calling 
for O'Donoghue's resignation, Labour especially has captured 
the public mood (and outflanked its much stronger opposition 
colleague Fine Gael).  END COMMENT.
