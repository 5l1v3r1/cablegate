¶1.  (SBU) Post welcomes and grants country clearance to 
OBO/OM/FAC Maintenance Support Branch Chief Santiago Rich III 
to travel to Dublin, Ireland, from January 28 to February 01, 
¶2006.  Purpose of visit is to consult with post management 
and the FM regarding the establishment and integration of the 
new FM position into post operations. 
 
¶2.  (U) Embassy control officer for this visit is FM Gill 
Serrao, office telephone 353-1-630-6243, home telephone 
353-1-205-3635, cell phone 353-87-127-1901, email: 
SerraoGW@state.gov.  Embassy telephone number while in 
country is (01) 668-8777 during business hours; (01) 668-9612 
after hours. 
 
¶3.  (U) Reservations have been made at the Berkeley Court 
Hotel, Landsdowne Road, Dublin 4, telephone number 
353-1-660-1711, fax 353-1-661-7238.  Room rate is Euro 177. 
Please provide post with fiscal data or credit card 
information to confirm the reservations. 
 
¶4.  (U) Please send a cable to post with traveler's security 
clearance information, if not already done, to facilitate 
unescorted access within the Embassy, as required by 12 FAM 
¶443. 
 
GENERAL TRAVEL INFORMATION 
 
¶5.  (U) There are no visa requirements for visitors traveling 
to Ireland on diplomatic or official passports. 
 
¶6.  (U) Please note that as of March 29, 2004, Ireland has 
instituted a smoking ban in the work place, including all 
pubs, restaurants, and hotel common areas.  Violation of this 
law may result in a fine of up to Euro 3,000.  Check with 
hotel staff upon arrival to determine if smoking is permitted 
in hotel room. 
 
¶7.  (U) Post policy is to provide airport pickup for 
employees at the rank of Deputy Assistant Secretary or above. 
 Other travelers should take the Dublin Aircoach (7 Euro one 
way, departure every 15 minutes) or a taxi (approximately 25 
Euro one way).  Travelers arriving with excess equipment or 
having special transportation needs should communicate those 
requirements to their Embassy control officer prior to 
arrival. 
 
¶8.  (U) Accommodation Exchange:  Post does not have check 
cashing or money changing facilities.  Major credit cards are 
widely accepted; ATM machines accept most major U.S. 
bankcards, and offer the best exchange rates. 
 
SECURITY INFORMATION FOR IRELAND 
 
¶9.  (U) Post is unaware of direct threats against Americans 
or U.S. interests in Ireland, and Ireland remains a 
relatively safe country where anti-American sentiment is 
rare.  For additional threat assessment information regarding 
Ireland, you may contact DS/DSS/ITA (Diplomatic Security's 
Office of Intelligence and Threat Assessment) in the State 
Department at 202-663-0787.  TDY visitors staying longer than 
30 days should schedule a briefing with the Regional Security 
Officer. 
 
¶10.  (U) Street Crime: Like any large urban center, Dublin 
has its share of street crime, especially pick-pocketing and 
purse-snatching.  Valuables should not be left unattended in 
cars and should be kept in hotel safe deposit boxes.  Do not 
carry large amounts of cash.  Violent confrontations and use 
of firearms are rare, however, and with reasonable 
precautions and common sense visitors should be able to enjoy 
a safe visit.  Police services are excellent; the number for 
emergency services in Ireland is 999 or 112. 
 
¶11.  (U) Terrorism: Ireland, like the rest of the world, 
shares an increased threat of terrorist incidents of 
international origin.  Travelers should remain aware of their 
surroundings and report suspicious people or activities to 
the police or RSO.
