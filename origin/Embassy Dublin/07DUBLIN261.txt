REF: STATE 38553 
 
(SBU) Ireland's Central Bank has notified all commercial 
banks operating in Ireland about UNSCR 1747 and the 
obligation to freeze assets of entities and individuals 
associated with Iran's nuclear and missile programs, 
according to Brian Cahalane, Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DFA) First Secretary for UN Affairs, to whom Pol/Econ Chief 
delivered reftel demarche on March 27.  Cahalane noted that 
Bank Sepah and Bank Sepah International were prominent among 
the designated entities referenced in the notification.  He 
also anticipated that the Ireland and Member States would 
receive official notification from the EU Commission by March 
30 about the adoption of UNSCR 1747.  Cahalane observed that 
Irish banks would be reluctant to conduct business with 
Iranian entities in any case, since such activity would harm 
the banks' public image.
