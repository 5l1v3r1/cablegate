SUBJECT: EL BASHIR'S ARREST WARRANT ELICITS MIXED REACTIONS 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Summary:  The March 4 International Criminal 
Court's (ICC) decision to issue an arrest warrant against 
Sudanese President Omar El Bashir for war crimes and crimes 
against humanity in Darfur has elicited strong reactions in 
Mauritania.  While the majority of the political class 
condemns the ICC's move, describing it as further proof that 
the ICC is nothing but an instrument of U.S. foreign policy, 
local human rights groups have expressed their support and 
satisfaction.  In a country with underlying racial tensions, 
where slavery is still practiced and where those responsible 
for the Afro-Mauritanian purges in the 90s have not been 
brought to justice, the decision brings both fear and hope. 
End summary.

DEPUTIES AND POLITICAL PARTIES CONDEMN DECISION 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  In a statement released March 4, Mauritanian 
parliamentarians condemned the ICC and expressed their 
support for El Bashir.  Labeling the arrest warrant "an 
injustice", the deputies state it is "eloquent proof that the 
ICC is nothing but another tool of American foreign policy - 
a policy characterized by double standards, particularly in 
the areas of African and Arab Affairs."  The communique 
accuses the ICC of seeking to destabilize Sudan while 
"refusing to even think about looking into war crimes 
commited by Israel in Gaza or Lebanon or by the Bush 
administration in Iraq and Afghanistan."  According to them, 
the decision highlights the degree of politicization of the 
court, which in their view has lost all credibility.  The 
group calls for all Arab and African nations to suspend their 
ICC membership and declared its unconditional solidarity with 
President El Bashir. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The Arab Nationalist/Baathist "Sawab" party 
released a communique March in which it stated that "the 
resolution taken by the so-called 'International Criminal 
Court' against the Sudanese president is just one in a series 
of humiliations that the West and the United States of 
America have perpetrated against Muslims in general, and 
Arabs in particular."  The communique went on to state that 
the goal of the resolution is not "to achieve justice for the 
victims, but to create sufficient conditions to break up the 
Arab Sudan lands by weakening the hold of its central 
authority." 
 
¶4. (SBU)  The Islamist "Tawassoul" party was similarly 
unimpressed by the ICC decision in a March 5 communique. 
Characterizing the ICC decision as "violation of Sudan's 
sovereignty," the statement asked how the ICC could at the 
same time "ignore crimes committed by the former Bush 
administration in Iraq and Afghanistan and successive 
governments of the Zionist entity."  The statement further 
called on all "Arab, Islamic, and peace-loving states" to not 
apply the ICC resolution. 
 
------------------------------- 
HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS SUPPORT ICC 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  On March 7, three human rights non-governmental 
organizations (SOS Esclaves, Association Mauritanienne des 
Droits de l'Homme, Association des Femmes Chefs de Familles) 
and a political association (Conscience et Resistance) 
released a joint statement entitled "Finally, the law takes 
precedence over the obstacles."  The group declared itself 
"overjoyed" by the ICC's decision, reinstated its support to 
the people of Darfur, and called for Mauritania to support 
the ICC.  The communique also addressed parliamentarian 
allegations that the ICC is an instrument of U.S. foreign 
policy by stating that the U.S. opposed the court's creation 
and accusing the deputies of being ignorant and cynical. 
According to the group, in Mauritania "where dozens of 
torturers get away with their racial crimes, the ICC's 
decision brings hope that the truth will come to light, and 
that the victims will be rehabilitated and receive redress." 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Comment:  As a country with underlying racial 
tensions between Moors, black Moors and Afro-Mauritanians, it 
is not surprising that the ICC's decision has been decried by 
those in power -- who fear its potential ramifications -- and 
embraced by human rights organizations that work against 
slavery and for the rights of those who lost family members 
in the early 90s racial purges.  Those most strongly 
supportive of the ICC decision are generally Black Moors or 
Afro-Mauritanian.  It is ironic that some Mauritanians view 
the ICC as a tool of U.S. domination as the U.S. is critical 
of it and has refused to join.  End comment.
