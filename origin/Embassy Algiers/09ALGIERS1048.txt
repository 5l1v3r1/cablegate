¶1. (SBU) Pol-Econ Chief on November 19 explained reftel 
points on the IAEA case against Iran to Hamza Khelif, head of 
the Sub-Directorate for Disarmament in the Algerian MFA's 
General Directorate for Political and International Security 
Affairs. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Saying he would refer the points to higher ministry 
authorities, Khelif showed special interest in the additional 
measures the P5 plus 1 had offered the IAEA to address Iran's 
concerns on the Tehran Research Reactor, especially the USG 
offer to join the agrement as a signatory and our support for 
the IAEA holding an equivalent amount of fuel material in 
escrow pending the enriched fuel's ultimate delivery to Iran. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Khelif reiterated the long-standing Algerian 
position supporting a peaceful resolution of the dispute 
through dialogue.
