PRIME MINISTER, NOT PRESIDENT, RECEIVES ABBAS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas 
followed in the footsteps of Lebanese party leader Saad 
Hariri (see reftel) and made a stop in Algiers July 26 as 
part of what Abbas described as a tour of Arab capitals 
devoted to "bilateral discussions on next steps" to address 
the situation in the Palestinian territories and Lebanon. 
Prime Minister Belkhadem received Abbas and, in his public 
comments after their meeting, reminded the Palestinian 
President of Algeria's support for the Palestinian people, 
commenting that "Algeria remained faithful to its 
principles."  Belkhadem's remarks, as reported in the press, 
where uncharacteristically terse, perhaps because President 
Bouteflika -- who would normally receive Abbas -- was 
inexplicably unavailable.  (Note:  A source at the Presidency 
told us that Bouteflika is out of the country on vacation, 
information which has not been reported in the press.  End 
Note.)  Abbas told the press the Rome Conference was a 
"failure" in light of the inaction to halt immediately the 
"complete and catastrophic" Israeli destruction.  Abbas 
underscored that the failure occurred despite the support of 
European and Arab countries for an immediate cease-fire. 
 
GOA CANCELS NORTHLAND PRESS EVENT 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Separately, the GOA canceled the July 27 press 
event scheduled aboard the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Northland 
(see reftel), and the U.S.-hosted reception aboard the vessel 
that evening was sparsely attended.  (Note:  According to MFA 
sources, the GOA was sensitive to the image of GOA officials 
standing on a U.S. "naval" vessel at a time when the U.S. is 
expediting the shipment of smart bombs to Israel for use in 
Lebanon.  End Note.)  The MFA and Ministry of National 
Defense (MND) were both represented, but in small numbers.  A 
single parliamentarian represented each major political 
party.  Contrary to prior notification from MFA that no one 
would represent that Ministry, Director for North America 
Laouari attended.  Laouari remarked to PolEc Chief that the 
GOA knew the current crisis would eventually pass and that it 
was important not to boycott the Northland entirely. 
 
LATEST RALLY FOR LEBANON DRAWS SMALL CROWD 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) A rally organized by the Presidential coalition 
parties and the Workers Party in solidarity with Lebanon for 
late afternoon July 26 had a disappointing turnout, according 
to political party sources.  Our contacts reported that only 
a couple of hundred people attended the rally, which had been 
widely advertised.  Newspaper photographs of the event in the 
official daily newspaper El Moudjahid showed a largely empty 
auditorium, and El Moudjahid did not report the number of 
persons in attendance.  The rally, at the end of a work week 
during the traditional vacation period, appears not to have 
generated much popular interest.
