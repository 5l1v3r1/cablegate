BELKHADEM:  WESTERN SAHARA DISPUTE ONE OF DECOLONIZATION 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶1.  In reaction to the visit last week of the Moroccan King 
Mohammed VI to the western side of the berm in the Western 
Sahara, the GOA and Polisario made public statements. 
Abdelaziz Belkhadem, former Foreign Minister and currently 
Minister of State and Personal Representative to President 
Bouteflika, asserted March 26 in Khartoum (in an interview 
that was broadcast by Al-Jazeera television) that the Western 
Sahara dispute was an issue of decolonization.  Speaking on 
the margins of the Arab Summit preparatory ministerial and 
reiterating long-held Algerian views, Belkhadem said the 
"best way to achieve a settlement of the problem of Western 
Sahara is through implementation of international legal 
decisions (i.e. Security Council resolutions) establishing 
the right of the Sahrawi people to self-determination." 
 
¶2.  Framing his argument on principle and avoiding direct 
criticism of Morocco, Belkhadem pointedly added that the 
Houston negotiations which took place in 1997 between 
representatives of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and 
of Morocco established "the right of the Sahrawi people to 
self-determination."  He noted that those negotiations 
established a benchmark for United Nations decisions 
concerning Western Sahara and reminded that the issue of the 
Western Sahara appeared every year on the agenda of the 
Fourth UN Commission as a decolonization issue. 
 
POLISARIO: BAKER PLAN HAS INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3.  In remarks widely reported in the Algerian press, Hritani 
Lahcene, counselor to Polisario leader Muhammad Abdelaziz, 
adopted a shriller tone, calling the King's visit "a media 
circus" in violation of international law.  "The King of 
Morocco," he said, "speaks of autonomy (for the Western 
Sahara) as the only solution.  Why, then, does he stubbornly 
reject the Baker Plan, which calls for a 4-5 year period of 
autonomy followed by a referendum on self-determination?" 
Characterizing the international support for the Polisario 
position as favorable, Lahcene said the Polisario was 
"confident" in its position that "the Baker Plan currently 
represents the only international consensus on resolving the 
conflict."  Another Polisario spokesman, Khalil Sidi 
Muhammad, separately accused Morocco of liberating only 30 
Sahrawi prisoners, leaving 37 still behind bars.
