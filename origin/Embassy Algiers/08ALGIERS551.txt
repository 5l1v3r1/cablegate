REF: A. STATE 048615 
     ¶B. STATE 21770 
 
¶1.  In response to ref A demarche, MFA Deputy Director for 
Multilateral Affairs Abdelmalek Bouheddou told us on May 13 
that Algeria was committed to playing its part in 
implementing the sanctions outlined in UNSCR 1803.  He 
stressed that Algeria "takes UN resolutions very seriously" 
and appreciated hearing the steps taken by the U.S. as 
outlined in our 60-day voluntary compliance report (a copy of 
which we provided to him). 
 
¶2.  By way of explanation, Bouheddou described the process by 
which the Algerian government took action on UNSCR 1803.  He 
said that when the resolution was transmitted from the UN to 
the MFA, the MFA tasked out action to concerned ministries 
and organizations -- the Interior Ministry, Ministry of 
Justice, Customs, Gendarmerie and others.  This internal 
implementation portion of UNSCR 1803, he said, was done 
promptly in March.  Given the slow response time of other 
Algerian ministries to the MFA and the volume of reports the 
MFA is asked to produce, Bouheddou said that Algeria had not 
filed a 60-day compliance report of its own, but he assured 
us that the provisions of the resolution had been transmitted 
to all relevant agencies in the Algerian government.
