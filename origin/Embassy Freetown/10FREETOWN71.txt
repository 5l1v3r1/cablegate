(U) Charge carried instructions reftel during wide-ranging meeting 
2/23 with MFA DirGen.  In addition to covering the key points of 
reftel, he provided the Director General the nonpaper in sufficient 
copies to share with other interested ministries and government 
entities. While nodding his understanding ( and presumably his 
agreement), he did not take it upon himself  to make any 
commitments on behalf of the GOSL.
