Â¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered the demarche to Chantal Elsenhout, Acting 
Head of the International Organizations Bureau, Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Government of the Republic of Suriname.  Elsenhout told 
Poloff, after checking with Suriname's Mission to the United 
Nations to ascertain Suriname's position on the resolution, that 
Suriname planned to support the resolution.  She denied that 
Suriname's decision was based on its being a member of the OIC, or 
because the NAM has pushed for countries to support the resolution, 
but Suriname's previous voting record indicates otherwise.
