REF: PRE-GYMNICH INSTRUCTIONS/TALKING POINTS FROM INTELLIPEDIA 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) New POLCOUNS and POLOFF delivered REF non-paper September 
3 to Cristian Olimid, MFA Director for EU External Relations. 
Olimid responded that the talking points were a bit late to be 
incorporated into FM Diaconescu's briefing papers.  (n.b. 
Diaconescu had departed a day earlier for bilateral meetings in The 
Hague.)  However, he expressed his appreciation for the regular 
sharing of U.S. views on GAERC and Gymnich meetings, as they helped 
Romania to better prepare its positions.  Olimid requested that 
future instructions/talking points be delivered sooner so that U.S. 
input could be taken fully into consideration in briefing the 
Minister.  He did not provide any substantive feedback on the 
talking points.
