Bucharest 
 
To Lt. Colonel Ira C. Queen 
Head of the Defense Cooperation Bureau 
 
Following your message of March 11, 2005, 
The Minister of National Defense approved, in a resolution 
on report number PI/312/01.31.2005, an offer of armaments 
donation to the Afghan National Army, comprised of 7,167 
pieces sub-machine guns 7.62 mm caliber, model 1963, with 
common butt (category I), and 783 pieces light machine guns, 
sub-machine guns 7.62 mm caliber, model 1964, with common 
butt (category II), with spare parts and accessories, if 
transportation abroad to the beneficiary is done by the 
Coalition's means. 
 
The offer was transmitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
in order to be conveyed, through diplomatic channels, to the 
U.S. Department of State. 
 
The items cannot be donated unless the Romanian Government 
adopts a decision in this regard.  To this purpose, the 
Romanian Government has to receive official letters from the 
US Department of Defense and from the Afghan Government to 
notify the acceptance of the donation and to mention who 
will provide the means of transportation of the donation on 
its external way to the beneficiary.  In this regard, I have 
requested the support of the chief of the liaison team of 
USCENTCOM, but support from your office would be extremely 
welcomed. 
 
The organization of the inspection of the items should not 
be a problem, provided you let us know in due time the 
period, the identity of the members of the inspection team 
and the objectives of the inspection, to get the necessary 
approvals. 
 
Respectfully yours, 
Brigadier General, Doctor, Engineer Emanoil Ciocotea 
Chief of the Logistics Directorate
