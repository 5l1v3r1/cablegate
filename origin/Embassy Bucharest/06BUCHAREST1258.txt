SUBJECT: BASESCU IN BAGHDAD: ROMANIAN TROOPS STAYING IN IRAQ, 
COMPANIES HOPE TO COME 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  President Traian Basescu made an August 9 trip to 
Iraq to emphasize Romania's commitment to stay in Iraq until the 
Iraqis ask them to leave.  His meetings with Iraqi officials also 
focused on getting Romanian companies reconstruction contracts, both 
to further support Iraq and to undermine one of PM Tariceanu's 
arguments against Romania's continued troop deployment.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) President Traian Basescu paid a short visit to Iraq on 
August 9 to hold talks with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, members 
of the Iraqi government, and the chief of the Multinational 
Coalition Forces, U.S. General George Casey.  Basescu also met 
Romanian troops operating in Iraq and located in Talil, at Camp 
Mitica. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a joint declaration after the meeting with the Iraqi 
president, Basescu reaffirmed Romania's continued strong engagement 
in Iraq.  Basescu said Romania wants to provide "political, 
economic, and military" support to Iraq and therefore "will pull out 
its troops when the Iraqi government makes a request in this regard 
and in agreement with the allies."  The Iraqi president expressed 
hope that Romania would continue to be a reliable bilateral and 
multilateral partner until Iraqi authorities would be able to fully 
assume responsibilities in maintain order and provide stability and 
security. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The two presidents also declared their determination to 
"intensify" the bilateral political dialogues through periodical 
meetings between members of the two countries' governments and 
parliaments.  In the same context, President Basescu and President 
Talabani analyzed the potential involvement of Romanian companies in 
the reconstruction of Iraq.  This issue was also addressed in the 
discussions with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki and other 
members of the Iraqi government.  Iraqi ministers said they would 
welcome Romania's participation in development projects related to 
agriculture, road and rail transportation, heating systems, oil 
refining, and armaments production. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The local press made much of Basescu's inspection of 
Romanian equipment after a U.S. newspaper referenced American 
soldiers' bets on which day Romanian Aro vehicles would break down. 
The local press also commented on Basescu's interruption of FM 
Ungureanu's Austrian vacation to take him on this visit to Iraq and 
Afghanistan, since Basescu is currently at odds with Defense 
Minister Atanasiu due to the latter's sudden proposal to withdraw 
from Iraq. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: President Basescu is keen to repudiate calls by 
his Prime Minister (and political rival) Tariceanu for the early 
withdrawal of Romanian forces from Iraq.  In addition, Romania is 
keen to get an economic return from its military investment in Iraq. 
 Basescu likely focused on this theme due to private comments from 
Tariceanu's camp that Romania has not gained any economic benefits 
from its involvement in Iraq.
