SUBJECT: CROATIA TREATS IRAQI CHILDREN 
 
¶1. (U) Seven seriously ill Iraqi children arrived in Zagreb 
on August 26 for medical treatment unavailable in Iraq.  The 
Government of Croatia will cover transportation costs as well 
as all expenses for the children and their accompanying 
escorts while in Croatia.  Responding to press queries, 
Deputy Prime Minister Andrea Hebrang said that this 
humanitarian assistance was not being given as "compensation" 
for Croatia not sending military troops to Iraq. 
 
¶2. (U) Minister of Science and Technology Dragan Primorac 
publicly praised the role of the U.S. Embassy in Zagreb for 
facilitating the logistics for this humanitarian effort.  In 
particular, USAID Zagreb coordinated with counterparts at 
AmEmbassy Baghdad to keep snafus on flight and ground 
transportation from delaying this effort. 
 
¶3. (U) Six Iraqi doctors who arrived on the same flight will 
stay in Zagreb for training in forensic psychiatry and 
forensic pathology.  Minister Primorac, himself a respected 
expert in forensic medicine, told the press that Croatia will 
train on DNA methods of identifying victims in mass graves.
