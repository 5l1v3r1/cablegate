¶1. Econ officer delivered reftel demarche to Pjer Simunovic, 
assistant minister, Directorate for International 
Organizations and Security. Simunovic was joined by Marta 
Nakic-Vojnovic, head of Section for Peace Support Operations, 
and Ivana Zivkovic Mikec, counsellor in the Directorate for 
International Economic Cooperation. Simunovic and 
Nakic-Vojnovic will represent Croatia at the ministerial in 
Stockholm. 
 
¶2. Simunovic said the GOC would like to provide financial 
assistance to Iraq, but he does not know when they will be in 
a position to do so. The GOC has an ambassador to Iraq, but 
Simunovic said it is cost prohibitive for him to be based in 
Baghdad at this time. Croatia has provided other kinds of 
support, such as medical care for children and programs for 
women and minority civic leaders. Simunovic said they intend 
to continue to pursue such opportunities.
