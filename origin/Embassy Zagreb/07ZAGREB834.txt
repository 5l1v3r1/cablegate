REF:  STATE 112485 
 
¶1. (U) Reftel points were delivered to Assistant Minister of 
Internal Affairs Filip Dragovic, who had no response, and to 
Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs for International 
Organizations and Security Pjer Simunovic. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Simunovic expressed his thanks for the information and said 
he was sorry to hear about the closure as the Croatians had "grown 
very much attached" to this operation and found it to be a 
successful one.  He said they would "now have to find something 
else," but if there are future opportunities to continue with the 
JIPTC some way, they would be able to participate. BRADTKE
