SUBJECT: CROATIAN MFA TRAINING DIPLOMATS FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 
 
 
¶1.  (U) The Croatian MFA announced November 28 that one diplomat 
from Afghanistan and two from Iraq have begun a one-year course on 
economic diplomacy at the MFA's Academy of Diplomatic Sciences in 
Zagreb.  Zeljko Vukosav, Head of the Diplomatic Training and 
Publishing Department at the Diplomatic Academy, told the Embassy 
that the three were part of a group of foreign diplomats (including 
four students from China, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania) 
attending this training along with 13 Croatian colleagues.   He 
noted that FM Grabar-Kitarovic personally extended the invitations 
to the Foreign Ministries of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the GOC is 
covering all costs of their stay. 
 
¶2. (U) COMMENT: This commendable diplomatic training initiative, a 
significant contribution for a small country, complements other GOC 
efforts to help in Iraq (Croatian police trainers worked 
successfully in Jordan at the police training center there) and 
Afghanistan (where Croatia has provided 150 soldiers to ISAF).  END
