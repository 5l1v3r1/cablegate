¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: In a July 14 introductory meeting 
with Ambassador Bradtke, Minister of Defense Berislav Roncevic 
reiterated the GoC's long-term commitment to keep troops in 
Afghanistan.  He said he will ask Parliament this fall for 
authorization to increase Croatia's force contribution to ISAF. 
We expect Parliament to approve raising the number of troops from 
approximately 150 (reftel) to 300.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
RONCEVIC: WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR EXTENDED ISAF PRESENCE

¶2. (SBU) Minister Roncevic assured the Ambassador that the US was 
Croatia's number one partner in defense and military cooperation 
and that the GoC will remain a reliable partner in ISAF and other 
international missions.  After visiting troops in Afghanistan, 
Roncevic said he is well aware of the reasons why foreign troops 
will be needed for a long time. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Roncevic highlighted the GoC's continued engagement with 
its Adriatic-Three partners.  He underlined the importance of 
this cooperation on the path to NATO membership.  Noting SecDef 
Rumsfeld's upcoming visit to Albania, Roncevic said the GoC 
intends to invite the SecDef to Dubrovnik.
