¶1. (U) Croatia's ICJ Oral Argument in Support of Kosovo's 
Declaration of Independence: Croatia is scheduled to give its oral 
argument in support of Kosovo's declaration of independence on 
December 7.  Croatian media speculated that Belgrade will react 
negatively to Croatia's presentation at the ICJ. 
 
¶2. (U) FM Jandrokovic and President Mesic's Public Statements on 
Troop Increases for ISAF: When asked over the weekend about possible 
troop increases from Croatia to the ISAF mission FM Jandrokovic said 
that "it is too early to talk about this."  He noted that "we need a 
government decision first and then a two-thirds majority in the 
Sabor." President Mesic, speaking to the press on December 5, stated 
that "there is no possibility of Croatia sending additional troops 
to the mission in Afghanistan at the moment," but that "we can talk 
about it again next year." 
 
¶3. (U) Croatian Parliament Adopts New Labor Law: The Croatian Sabor 
passed a new labor law on November 4.  The law establishes the 
maximum number of hours per week at 40, with a maximum of 8 hours of 
overtime.  An amendment was also adopted stating that pregnant women 
should not work night shifts unless they request it and receive a 
physician's approval.   The opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
and Croatian labor unions criticized the law because it did not set 
limits for the period of time workers can perform temporary 
contractual labor without the promise of full-time employment.
