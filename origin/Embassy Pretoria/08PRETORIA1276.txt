¶2.  Begin text: 
 
We, the Government of the Republic of Burundi and the 
Palipehutu-FNL, have come together today in South Africa to 
deliver a common message of all Burundians to the 
international community, on the occasion of the meeting of 
the Special Envoys of the Great Lakes Region to Burundi. 
 
This is an opportunity for us, on behalf of all Burundians, 
to thank the Regional Initiative, the South African 
Facilitation, the United Nations through its Integrated 
Office in Burundi, the African Union, the European Union and 
all other partners who are continually contributing to the 
peace process in Burundi. 
 
We have decided to end hostilities, as we are aware that the 
people of Burundi have, for too long, suffered from them.  On 
26 May 2008, within the Political Directorate, we signed a 
joint declaration by which we decided on an immediate 
cessation of hostilities. 
 
Since then, we have, within the Joint Verification and 
Monitoring Mechanism (JVMM), shown our desire to overcome our 
differences, and this enabled us to adopt, on 2nd June 2008, 
the Joint Operations Plan, which will guide the JVMM during 
the process of disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and 
rehabilitation.  In this regard, we particularly thank the 
African Union, the European Union, Switzerland and the 
International Committee of the Red Cross for the food, 
medical and logistics support they are providing to 
Palipehutu-FNL combatants during the pre-cantonment phase. 
 
We have also come, united, to ask the international community 
to continue lending its assistance so that we can move 
forward together on the path of peace for the benefit of all 
Burundians. 
 
Johannesburg, 8 June 2008.
