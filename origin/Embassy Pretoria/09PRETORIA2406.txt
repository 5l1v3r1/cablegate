REF: STATE 118799 
 
Â¶1.  Embassy Pretoria has received no feedback from the South 
African government regarding reftel points.  On November 19 
the text of the talking points was formatted as a non-paper, 
scanned, and emailed to Megan Govender, Deputy Director of 
the UNGA desk within the multilateral unit of the Department 
of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO).  Poloff 
called Govender the following day and gave a brief synopsis 
of the demarche.  Govender suggested he confer with his 
colleagues and relay any relevant views on November 23.  The 
lack of a call suggests the SAG is unchanged in its current 
stance, which has been to support resolutions censuring 
Israel.  Post will relay any future developments.
