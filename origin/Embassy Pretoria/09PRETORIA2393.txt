(SBU) Deputy Political Counselor delivered reftel message to 
Department of International Relations and Cooperation Deputy 
Director for Nuclear Disarmament and Nonproliferation Johann 
Kellerman on November 23.  Kellerman said South Africa's 
general policy is not to co-sponsor any resolution that it 
did not help to draft.  He added that Pretoria does 
occasionally make exceptions to this general rule and would 
look at co-sponsoring the Russian draft IAEA resolution to 
authorize the IAEA Director General to enter into agreements 
establishing the first international nuclear fuel reserve in 
Angarsk, Russia.
