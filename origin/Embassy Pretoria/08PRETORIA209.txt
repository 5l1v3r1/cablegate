Foreign Sell-off Imperils Rand, Current Account 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. (U) Foreigners have sold up to R8 billion ($1.1 billion) of 
local bonds and equities since January 24, making January the 
third consecutive month of net sales for South Africa.  Apart from 
hurting the rand and threatening the current account, which is 
financed through foreign inflows, it will cause the South African 
Reserve Bank (SARB) to use hard-won reserves to shore up the 
deficit.  Those reserves were part of the reason that ratings 
agencies upgraded South Africa's international credit status. 
Global financial house CITI said the large net sales came after 
offshore accounts that were heavily invested in precious metals 
learned that some mines were shut down due to power shortfalls. 
According to CITI, the last time foreigners were dumping domestic 
stocks and bonds was in 2003, but back then the current account 
deficit was 1.1% of GDP compared to 8.1% in the third quarter of 
¶2007.  According to the latest statistics from the JSE and the 
Bond Exchange of South Africa, foreigners have sold off 171% more 
in equities than they had at this time last year.  The bond market 
was also trending towards net sales for the month (?).  While many 
analysts view the sell-off as a change in risk appetite, Rudolph 
Vermeulen, a derivatives trader at online brokerage Global Trader, 
said some investors were just taking their profits in an attempt 
to weather stormy markets elsewhere in the world.  (Business Day,

Inflation Rises above Forecasts 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) According to Statistics South Africa data, CPIX inflation 
(consumer price inflation less mortgage interest rates) surged 
from 7.9% y/y in November 2007 to 8.6% y/y in December, racing 
further away from the 3 to 6% target band.  Originally, a Reuters 
poll forecasted that CPIX would rise to 8.5% y/y in December. 
"The number is a little bit higher than the market expected.  The 
market has been saying news on inflation is likely to get worse 
before it gets better," Nedbank senior economist Nicky Weimer 
said.  A cumulative 400-basis point interest rate hike since June 
2006 has failed to stem inflation, spurred largely by rising 
global food and fuel costs.  Local petrol pump prices rose by 6.1% 
in its monthly adjustment in December.  The rand weakened from 
R7.22 to R7.27 against the dollar after the data was released.

MPC Leaves Repo Rate Steady at 11% 
---------------------------------- 
 
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept the repo rate steady at 
11.0% on January 31, in line with expectations, despite a further 
surge in inflation last month.  This leaves the prime interest 
rate at 14.5%.  South African Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni 
said there were still considerable risks to the inflation outlook, 
but economic growth was expected to slow, although there were no 
indications of a recession in Africa's biggest economy.  "In the 
light inter-alia of heightened economic uncertainties, both 
domestically and globally, and some evidence of moderation in 
domestic expenditure, the MPC has decided that it is appropriate 
 
PRETORIA 00000209  002.2 OF 004 
 
 
at this time to leave the repo rate unchanged at 11%," he said in 
a televised statement.  The decision follows four consecutive 50- 
basis-point increases since June 2007 and a cumulative 400-basis- 
point hike since June 2006 as the MPC battled to tame inflationary 
pressures.  (Business Day, January 31, 2008) 
 
------------------------------------- 
Banks Expected to Post Robust Profits 
------------------------------------- 
 
 
¶5. (U) Standard & Poor's (S&P) said South African banks are 
expected to post robust profits and asset quality as a result of 
strong growth in business and the absence of exposure to sub-prime 
mortgages.  But the rating agency said banks also faced growing 
macro-economic and political risks from rising inflation in an 
overheating economy and uncertainty over the presidential 
succession next year.  "Balancing these opposing forces over the 
coming months will be the central challenge for the country's big 
four banks - Absa Bank, FirstRand Bank, Nedbank and Standard Bank 
- that collectively hold more than 80% of South Africa's banking 
assets," S&P said in its report entitled, "South African Banks 
Balance Robust Growth With Rising Risks in 2008."  "GDP growth 
rates of 5 to 6% in South Africa over the past five years, as well 
as deregulation in the banking sector, have contributed to strong 
earnings growth for the banks," said S&P South Africa and Sub- 
Saharan Africa Managing Director.  However, a local analyst 
indicated that the "domino effect" of the power crisis could 
dampen growth prospects.  S&P said growth in the banking sector 
was "likely to slow somewhat" this year, as inflation was still 
well above the upper end of the Reserve Bank's target range and 
interest rates were high at 11%, and were expected to increase 
further in the first quarter of 2008.  "With significant 
infrastructure projects coming on stream, partly in preparation 
for the 2010 World Cup, we still expect this year to be a positive 
year for bank revenues," S&P Credit Analyst Jerome Chui said.

Metrorail Unveils Expansion Plans 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Metrorail CEO Lucky Montana has embarked on an R18 billion 
($2.5 billion) strategy aimed at stabilizing the company by 2010. 
Improving train punctuality, reliability, customer service and 
commuter safety are at the top of his agenda.  Montana took over 
at Metrorail in July 2006 after it was transferred from Transnet 
to the Department of Transport's South Africa Rail Commuter Corp. 
The strategy includes upgrading rail infrastructure; ensuring 
train frequencies during peak hours; extending daily operating 
hours; and addressing commuter confidence.  He reported that 
ageing assets and insufficient rolling stock challenge Metrorail 
operations.  About 2 million South Africans use trains daily and 
there has "been under investment in rail going back over 30 
years," said Montana.  The average age of the fleet is 40 years 
and only about 3,000 of its 4,600 coaches are operational. 
Montana says this lack of capacity is one of the main reasons for 
the company's shrinking service and inability to meet demand.  He 
Qthe company's shrinking service and inability to meet demand.  He 
aimed to have 96% of the fleet on the tracks by 2010.  He added 
that Metrorail intends to expand its service in the next two 
years.  Planned new lines will offer service to the FNB soccer 
stadium in Johannesburg, which will host the 2010 soccer World Cup 
final, as well as to Durban's King Senzangakhona and Soweto's 
Orlando stadiums.  (Financial Mail, January 25, 2008)

MTN Outsources IT Services to IBM 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) MTN South Africa has outsourced its information systems 
division, which looks after its technology services, to IBM.  MTN 
Managing Director announced that in "a number of business areas, 
MTN partners with globally recognized best-of-breed service 
providers like IBM, to gain access to best practice and 
international core competencies for the benefit of its own 
business and to enable MTN to provide world-class services to its 
customers."  The deal was rumored to be worth an estimated R1 
billion ($138 million).  MTN has annual revenues of R25 billion 
($3.5 billion).  IBM Country General Manager said the agreement 
 
PRETORIA 00000209  003.2 OF 004 
 
 
would enable MTN to tap into IBM's global experience in the 
implementation of innovative solutions similar to those of global 
telecoms operators.  (Business Report, January 29, 2008) 
 
------------------------------------ 
Hi-Tech Prawn Farming to Create Jobs 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶8. (U) Sea Ark Afrika, a subsidiary of the Bosasa Group of 
Companies has established a pilot hi-tech prawn farm project at 
the Coega Industrial Zone in Port Elizabeth.  Prawn farming is 
traditionally conducted in open-air ponds, which makes prawns 
susceptible to disease and results in farming losses.  This new 
project, regarded as a first of its kind, will operate in a bio- 
secured and disease-free facility.  High quality diets and 
filtered water will be provided.  The project will involve the 
development of a 1,200 hectares farming facility following a 
successful pilot phase.  The final project is expected to be 
completed in 2014 at a cost of R9.2 billion ($1.3 billion).  A 
Sea Ark official noted that research and development for the 
project was conducted in both the U.S. and South Africa at a cost 
of $40 million.  Sea Ark Afrika President David Wills described 
the facility as a "sustaining, job-creating and technologically 
innovating project".  Wills said the farm is expected to create 
11,800 jobs, with 1,000 jobs slots slated specifically for women.

Not So Fast - South Africa Still on Top for 
Gold Production 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) Early estimates showed that China had overtaken South 
Africa as world leader, but more recent reports confirm that South 
Africa topped China's gold output in 2007, with 272 tons to 270.5 
tons, respectively, according to the China Gold Association.  The 
two countries were neck in neck in gold output in the second half 
of the year, leading London-based GFMS to estimate that China had 
already become the world's largest producer, and prompting hand- 
wringing in South Africa.   South African output has been 
constrained by dwindling ore grades, accidents, rising labor 
costs, and - most recently - by power disruptions.  New South 
African deep mines still show great economic mineral potential.

------------------------------------ 
Record High Gold and Platinum Prices 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶10. (U) Gold and platinum hit all-time highs on January 25, after 
a power crisis closed South African mines.  South Africa's three 
main gold producers and the world's largest platinum miner 
suspended production, sending precious metal prices to new highs. 
Spot gold hit an intraday high of $922.40 an ounce, surpassing 
last week's record.  "It's pointing at $950.  Now there's a power 
shortage (and) everything is in favor of gold for the time being," 
said Lee Cheong Gold Dealers Director Ronald Leung.  Analysts 
noted that gold could undergo a downward correction after a U.S. 
Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates this week but the 
downside could be limited to $880 or $900.  "I don't expect it to 
go down to $850 again if there's a correction this time," Leung 
Qgo down to $850 again if there's a correction this time," Leung 
said.  Another industry analyst predicted the price of gold to 
reach $1,000 an ounce by June 2008.  Platinum also reached a 
historic high of $1,652 an ounce.  "Platinum is confronted by a 
big supply and demand problem.  The price will be very strong in 
the future.  Within a month, the next price target is $1,650," 
said Yukuji Sonoda, precious metals analyst at Daiichi 
Commodities.  On Thursday, Lonmin, the world's third largest 
platinum producer, cut its sales outlook for the year after first- 
quarter refined platinum output slid by nearly a fifth due to 
safety shutdowns and persistent processing problems.  (Mining

Government Reassures Investors 
------------------------------ 
 
 
¶11. (U) Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica announced 
 
PRETORIA 00000209  004.2 OF 004 
 
 
that the government will do all it can to ensure that the power 
crisis "does not impact negatively investments," after a meeting 
with mining and industry leaders.  South Africa is currently 
listed among the world's top 20 investment destinations, but 
recent power outages, particularly across the country's mining 
sector, have threatened this status.  Companies lost an average of 
24% of labor production as a result of this month's power cuts. 
Eskom estimated that supply problems will persist until 2013. 
"This is a temporary situation and what we are going to do is 
manage our way through it so that it doesn't impact on the 
country's growth trajectory," said Public Enterprises Minister 
Alec Erwin.  Erwin was confident that South Africa would continue 
to attract investment despite the power crisis.  He said it was 
obvious that the current situation would impact economic growth if 
it continued unmanaged.  The government spoke with investors so 
that "coordinated growth in energy needs could be catered without 
further jeopardizing the system".  Already the threat of poor 
power supplies had resulted in foreign companies questioning their 
investments, and local mining companies having to revisit 
expansion plans.  Trade unions warned that the production stoppage 
in the mining industry could cost jobs, but Erwin felt this was 
premature.  (Business Day, January 29, 2008)

CEF Funds Solar-powered Traffic Lights 
-------------------------------------- 
 
12 (U) The Central Energy Fund (CEF) announced a commitment of 
over $5.8 million to erect solar-powered traffic lights at major 
intersections in South Africa's main cities.  CEF CEO Mputumi 
Damane noted that this effort is meant to mitigate the affects of 
recent power shortages, which have caused traffic jams and 
accidents.  Cape Town City municipality successfully launched a 
pilot project utilizing these solar-powered traffic lights in 
September 2007.  New installations are aimed for the cities of 
Ethekwini (Durban), Johannesburg, Nelspruit, Port Elizabeth, and 
Tshwane (Pretoria).  CEF expected the capital investment required 
 
SIPDIS 
to complete this project to rise above $14.3 million and will be 
soliciting funds from private investors.  Damane said investors 
could claim up to 150% of their investment in their next tax 
returns.  (Business Day, January 23, 2008)
