Â¶1.  Per request in reftel, post provides the following 
comments regarding OPIC's proposed backing of Ethos Fund V. 
 
--  Capital to build houses will improve the serious shortage 
of low-income housing in South Africa and is compatible with 
SAG's current housing policies. 
 
--  Funds for housing are provided by other sources, 
including SAG programs, charitable funds, and commercial 
banks, many of which make use of USAID loan guarantee 
programs.  However, additional capital from other sources, 
such as OPIC, are still necessary to help meet current 
housing needs. 
 
--  USAID officers are aware of the Ethos Fund, and do not 
know of any problems associated with this Fund.
