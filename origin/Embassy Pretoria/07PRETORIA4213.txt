REF: A. SECSTATE 167211 
 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 166909 
 
¶1.  (SBU) A/PolCouns presented reftel non-paper to DFA Deputy 
Director: UN Security Council (Thematic Issues) Ilia du 
Buisson on 18 December.  Joining the meeting was UK Second 
Secretary David McNaught, who presented nearly identical 
 
SIPDIS 
points from London and, in the absence of a British 
non-paper, associated himself with the U.S one. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) An embarassed du Buisson admitted that she had 
"absolutely no instructions" on this issue, since all 
decision-makers (including PermRep Khumalo) were in 
Polokwane, Limpopo for ANC leadership elections.  She was 
grateful for the non-paper and said she would forward it 
immediately in the hopes that news of a clear U.S. and 
European position would provoke a discussion on the margins 
in Polokwane.  She said that SAG players were well informed 
on the issues, having met directly and repeatedly with 
representatives from both sides, and listed the factors that 
she expected would be considered in the decision-making 
process:  South Africa's successful experience with 
negotiations in ending apartheid; ideological questions 
regarding the role of the UN and especially the UN Security 
Council; absence of international consensus; and, to a lesser 
degree, others' attempts to claim this would set a precedent. 
 Du Buisson said she honestly had no idea what the leadership 
would decide, but agreed to inform the U.S. and UK once she 
had instructions from Polokwane. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT: What the SAG really wants is for the two 
sides to follow the South African example and sit around a 
table talking things through until they come to a mutually 
acceptable solution.  This experience is central to the South 
African approach to conflict resolution, and it is difficult 
for the SAG to believe that it is unachievable in the current 
context.  That said, the SAG's worst fears are a unilateral 
declaration of independence by the Kosovars and/or renewed 
violence in the region -- they would certainly prefer 
Ahtisaari over either of those alternatives.  The UK High 
Commissioner and several other European Chiefs of Mission are 
currently on the ground in Polokwane.  McNaught will 
recommend they approach senior SAG officials there to further 
press the issue.  END COMMENT.
