SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA INITIATES SUNSET REVIEW OF 
ANTIDUMPING DUTIES ON L-LYSINE HCI 
 
 
¶1.  South Africa's International Trade Administration 
Commission (ITAC) provided post with notice that it has 
initiated a sunset review of the anti-dumping duties on 
l-lysine HCI (tariff subheading 2922.41) originating in or 
imported from the U.S.  ITAC is currently in the process of 
contacting all known exporters of the product to SACU in 
order to be given the opportunity to assist with the 
investigation.  The known exporters have been provided with a 
questionnaire.  The time-limit for exporters to respond to 
the questionnaire is 15:00 February 26, 2007. 
 
¶2.  SA Bioproducts (Pty) Ltd, a South African company, has 
alleged that lifting the duties would result in renewed 
dumping.  The only known exporters/manufacturers of products 
exported to SACU are listed as: Archer Daniels Midlands 
Company,/Animal Nutrition of Decatur, Illinois, and ADM 
Speciality Ingredients BV of the Netherlands.  Ajinomoto 
Heartland of Chicago, Illinois is the only listed 
manufacturer of the product in the U.S. who has not exported 
to SACU. 
 
¶3.  A full copy of ITAC's Notice, Export Sunset Review 
Questionnaire, and SA Bioproduct's completed application can 
be forwarded via email if requested.  Please contact economic 
officer Leslie Freriksen at freriksenld@state.gov to obtain a 
copy.
