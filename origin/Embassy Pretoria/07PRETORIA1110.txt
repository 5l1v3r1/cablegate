¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  South Africa's Parliament held an 
extraordinary debate on Zimbabwe March 28, with opposition 
parties strongly criticizing the Government's Zimbabwe 
policy.  DepForMin van der Merwe defended the SAG policy, but 
stated that the GOZ's recent crackdown was a "major cause for 
concern" and urged the GOZ to "ensure that the rule of law 
and human rights" are respected.  The previous day, DepForMin 
Pahad said that the economic situation in Zimbabwe is 
"reaching dire proportions."  Pahad called the South African 
approach "constructive diplomacy," and pointedly complained 
about Western governments for criticizing the SAG Zimbabwe 
policy without making constructive policy suggestions.  Van 
der Merwe's comments were the strongest to date by a SAG 
official and represent a shift toward a more critical and 
honest South African public position on Zimbabwe.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Parliamentary Debate on Zimbabwe 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The South African Parliament held a lively debate on 
Zimbabwe March 28, with Deputy Foreign Minister Sue van der 
Merwe in the difficult position of defending SAG Zimbabwe 
policy.  Van der Merwe repeated many familiar SAG themes on 
Zimbabwe -- "inclusive dialogue" is key, Zimbabweans must 
solve their own crisis, sanctions are not helpful -- but also 
made the strongest statements to date by a senior SAG 
official on the Government of Zimbabwe's recent opposition 
crackdown.  Van der Merwe said that: 
 
-- the arrests, detention and assaults of senior opposition 
leaders are "a major cause of concern;" 
 
-- stressed the SAG's "concern, disappointment and 
disapproval of the measures undertaken by the security forces 
in dealing with the political protests;" 
 
-- urged the GOZ to "ensure that the rule of law and the 
human rights of the Zimbabwean citizens are respected;" and, 
 
-- called on the GOZ to "create a climate conducive for 
political dialogue" and the opposition to "participate 
unreservedly" in efforts to solve the crisis. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a not-so-subtle criticism of the United States, 
the United Kingdom, and Australia, van der Merwe said that 
South Africa has "avoided the temptation" to compete on "who 
will shout loudest or trade the worst insults" against the 
GOZ leadership.  Sanctions will only deepen the current 
crisis, in her view. 
 
¶4. (U) Opposition parties strongly criticized the SAG 
Zimbabwe policy.  Inkatha Freedom Party's Albert Mncwango 
said that South Africa "must denounce the Zimbabwean regime 
immediately, decisively, and irrevocably for what it is: a 
hideous and destructive dictatorship which must go." 
Democratic Alliance Chief Whip Douglas Gibson urged the 
imposition of smart sanctions against Mugabe, his wife, and 
cabinet ministers, so that South Africa is "no longer their 
place for luxury shopping."  Gibson suggested that South 
Africa should offer Mugabe "a comfortable retirement and 
political asylum" if he would agree to leave power.

Pahad Highlights "Dire" Economic Crisis in Zimbabwe 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶5. (U) Van der Merwe's parliamentary remarks followed a March 
27 press conference by her fellow DepForMin Aziz Pahad. 
Calling the South African approach to Zimbabwe "constructive 
diplomacy," Pahad said that the "economic situation is 
reaching dire proportions."  Pahad said that Western 
governments -- whose statements on Zimbabwe are merely 
"self-gratification" -- should not criticize the SAG without 
making constructive policy suggestions.  He repeated his 
comment from last week that if the international community 
had worked together to find a common approach on Zimbabwe "we 
would not find ourselves confronted with the crisis we do so 
today."

¶6. (SBU) Responding to questions, Pahad said that Zimbabwe 
Vice President Mujuru's trip to South Africa (reftel) was 
"very private."  SAG Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka 
met Mujuru at a meeting organized by an unspecified NGO, and 
the situation in Zimbabwe was not/not discussed.  (NOTE: 
Several press reports and Embassy sources have told us that 
the situation in Zimbabwe -- specifically how to remove 
Mugabe from power -- was very much the topic of discussion. 
END NOTE.)  He also reported that UK PM Blair has written a 
letter to Mbeki on Zimbabwe, although Pahad has not seen the 
letter.  Pahad mentioned that Zimbabwean Reserve Bank 
Governor Gono had "presented a detailed report of the crisis 
in the Zimbabwean economy" to the SAG a month ago and seemed 
to suggest some sort of initiative on cross-party dialogue to 
solve the economic crisis (NFI). 
 
----------------------------------- 
Other SAG Officials Add Their Voice 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Two other respected SAG officials made encouraging 
statements this week.  Deputy Chief of the Constitutional 
Court Justice Dikgang Moseneke said on March 28 that 
Zimbabwean judges could "count on (South Africa's) judiciary 
for the kind of solidarity and support that may facilitate 
the restoration of a democratic process."  Reserve Bank 
Governor Tito Mboweni warned on March 27 that Zimbabwe's 
economy will continue to decline unless "policy changes" are 
made, stating that his colleagues in Zimbabwe were trying to 
tame inflation but that "constraints on the production side 
of the economy" must be removed.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) The South African Government's public position is 
becoming increasingly critical of the Government of Zimbabwe, 
largely because of growing domestic and regional pressure (as 
well as Mugabe's impossible-to-defend actions).  While not 
yet using the words "criticize" or "condemn," van der Merwe's 
prepared comments were the strongest to date, and mark a 
significant shift from the March 13 DFA written statement, 
which merely expressed "concern" about the reports of 
"difficulties being experienced by the political leadership" 
in Zimbabwe (reftel).  The SAG is also being much more 
explicit in acknowledging the extent of the economic disaster 
in Zimbabwe (using terms like "meltdown" and "dire 
situation"), thus raising the stakes for its diplomatic 
efforts to end the crisis.
