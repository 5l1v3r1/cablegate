Summary 
------- 
¶1. (U) On August 3, 2005, the Department of Minerals and 
Energy increased the prices of gasoline, diesel, and 
kerosene to new all-time highs.  All of the increase was 
due to the higher international crude oil price.  End 
Summary. 
 
Government Announces Further Price Increases 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶2. (U) On August 3, the Department of Minerals and Energy 
(DME)  again  increased the retail price of  gasoline  in 
rand terms by 5.0% and the wholesale prices of diesel and 
kerosene  by  an average of 3.1% and 3.7%,  respectively. 
This is on top of the respective July 6 increases of 5.7% 
(retail),  and  10.5% and 8.9% (wholesale).   A  slightly 
strengthening  rand was overshadowed by the  increase  in 
the  international price of crude oil, which was  totally 
responsible for this month's price increases.  The tables 
below show the increases in the average price of fuel  in 
Johannesburg and components for the new price.
