SUBJECT: MBEKI SAYS HE WILL NOT SEEK THIRD TERM 
 
This Cable is Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for Internet 
distribution. 
 
¶1. (U) President Mbeki said in a press interview February 5 
that he will not/not seek a third term as South African 
President.  Mbeki was last elected in 2004 for a second 
five-year term.  Section 88 of the South African Constitution 
limits presidents to two terms of office, and a third term 
for Mbeki would have required a constitutional amendment. 
Mbeki said the ANC has "taken a stand not to alter the 
constitution even with two-thirds majority support in 
government." 
 
¶2. (U) Mbeki's comments put to rest recent speculation about 
a third term caused by an initiative of governing alliance 
junior partner, the South African National Civic Organization 
(SANCO).  SANCO head Mlungisi Hlongwane said on January 28 
that he would table a motion in the governing alliance to 
change the Constitution to remove presidential term limits. 
Hlongwane argued that term limits are a European concept and 
deny South Africa "the opportunity to sustain development 
programmes that had been started."  The ANC's other alliance 
partners, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) 
and South African Communist Party (SACP), firmly rejected 
Hlongwane's suggestion to amend the constitution, as have 
most media commentators. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  While Mbeki rejected the possibility of 
running for another term as South African President in 2009, 
we note that he did not/not close the door on pursuing a 
third term as ANC President in 2007.
