ORIENTATION TO THE WORKING ENVIRONMENT, A WORKING 
BREAKFAST WITH SIGNIFICANT PLAYERS IN THE WESTERN CAPE 
FILM COMMUNITY, AND A RECEPTION FOR A BROADER AUDIENCE 
HOSTED BY PAO PAUL PATIN AT HIS RESIDENCE, THE AMERICAN 
FILM INSTITUTE (AFI) DELEGATION WAS VERY WELL PRIMED TO 
PRESENT FOUR HIGHLY RELEVANT WORKSHOPS TO CULTURALLY 
DIVERSE AUDIENCES THAT INCLUDED BOTH EMERGING AND 
ESTABLISHED FILMMAKERS. IN ADDITION TO ISSUING SOUTH 
AFRICAN DOCUMENTARY FILM MAKERS WITH AN INVITATION TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE 2006 SILVERDOCS FESTIVAL, THE THREE 
AFI REPRESENTATIVES ALSO PROVIDED INFORMATION ON THE 
CHANNELS AND MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION FOR DOCUMENTARY 
FILMS IN THE U.S.  THE TRIO PROVIDED A NUMBER OF 
SCREENINGS AND DISCUSSIONS AT WORKSHOPS ON THE UNIQUE 
SKILLS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF DOCUMENTARY FILM MAKING, 
BROADENING THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER US-SA EXCHANGE IN 
AN INDUSTRY DESTINED TO BE AN IMPORTANT ECONOMIC 
ACTIVITY IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD. OVERALL, THE 
EXCHANGE WAS RECEIVED VERY POSITIVELY BY THE WESTERN 
CAPE AUDIENCES.
