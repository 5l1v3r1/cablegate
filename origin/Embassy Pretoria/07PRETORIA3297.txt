¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  South Africa expects to expand its 
ambitious program to train officials from southern Sudan. 
Begun in 2005, the program has brought more than 700 
officials from Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) to South 
Africa for classroom and practical training in fields as 
diverse as local government finances to diplomacy.  Costing 
the SAG USD 2.35 million, this program is but one example of 
South Africa's emerging role as a donor in Africa and as a 
regional strategic policy leader in continental conflict 
resolution.  Post will contribute USD 150,000 in bilateral 
development assistance to the SAG program in FY 2007.  We 
believe these types of programs will reinforce USG-SAG 
cooperation on regional issues.  Helping the South Africans 
to build capacity in their foreign assistance programs also 
serves U.S. long-term interests in Africa.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------- 
Ambitious Training Program 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Since 2005, the South African Government (SAG) has 
undertaken an ambitious and wide-ranging capacity building 
program for officials and leaders from the Government of 
Southern Sudan (GOSS).  The SAG just completed its thirteenth 
training session for GOSS officials, and plans two more 
sessions before the end of 2007.  The standard training model 
is for the University of South Africa (UNISA) to provide two 
to three weeks of "theoretical" training in Pretoria, 
followed by a two week "practical" internship working inside 
a SAG governmental department.  The U.S. Embassy hosted a 
group of southern Sudanese diplomats in June 2005 for one day 
during a training session on diplomacy and international 
relations (ref A). 
 
¶3. (SBU) The training has covered a range of topics, 
including:  governance and leadership, public administration, 
diplomacy, communications, finance, judicial services, 
correctional and police services, intergovernmental 
coordination, and local government management.  While 
initially concentrated on Government of National Unity (GNU) 
and GOSS level leaders, the program has focused increasingly 
on state and county level officials.  More than 700 officials 
have taken part in the training.  To date, the SAG has 
self-funded the training at a cost of approximately Rand 
16.45 million or approximately USD 2.35 million.  The program 
coordinator on the GOSS side is the Ministry of Regional 
Cooperation. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) delegation, 
led by Office Director Graham Maitland, is visiting Juba the 
week of September 17 (ref B) to examine the effectiveness of 
the program and plan future activities for 2008 - 2011. 
According to Phindile Xaba, DFA Deputy Director for the Horn 
of Africa, President Mbeki supports the program and is 
committed to its continuation, even expansion.  Xaba noted 
that the SAG would like to move some of the training to 
southern Sudan, where they could train more officials at a 
lower cost. 
 
------------------- 
GOSS to Open Office 
------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Government of Southern Sudan strongly supports 
the SAG training program, according to John G. Nyuot Yoh, who 
heads the GOSS representation in South Africa.  Yoh said that 
GOSS believes the program has been effective and should be 
expanded.  Yoh is finalizing preparations to open a GOSS 
"liaison office" in Pretoria by the end of September.  The 
office will be located in the Hatfield neighborhood at 440 
Fehrsen Street, and will be headed by Yoh.  (BIO NOTE: Yoh is 
a lecturer at the University of South Africa in the 
Department of Political Science, but is taking a two-year 
leave of absence to open the GOSS office.  END NOTE.)

U.S. Support and Comment 
------------------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) We believe helping the South Africans to build 
capacity in their foreign assistance programs serves U.S. 
long-term interests in Africa.  While still a recipient of 
foreign aid, South Africa is emerging as a donor in its own 
right in Africa (ref C) and as a regional strategic policy 
leader in continental conflict resolution.  The SAG has 
entered into a series of agreements with other OECD donors, 
some multi-million dollar programs over several years, for 
programs in DRC, Sudan, Burundi, and Rwanda.  The SAG terms 
these programs "trilateral agreements," reflecting the 
partnership between the SAG, the donor, and the recipient 
country. 
 
¶7. (SBU) At the request of DFA, the U.S. Mission will provide 
USD 150,000 in bilateral development assistance to the SAG in 
FY 2007 to support the GOSS-DFA-UNISA program.  (NOTE: Post 
is also providing USD 150,000 to the SAG Department of 
Provincial and Local Government (DPLG) for a local government 
program in the DRC.  END NOTE.)  In addition to its impact in 
southern Sudan, we believe the program offers an opportunity 
to reinforce shared U.S.-South African interests on the 
continent and deepen cooperation on regional issues.
