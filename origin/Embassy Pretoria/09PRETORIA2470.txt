SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA:  OBSERVATION OF MARITIME RESPONSE SQUADRON 
ACOTA TRAINING 
¶1.  (SBU) Naval Attache and Deputy Political Counselor visited 
Saldanha Naval Base on November 24 to observe a State Department 
Africa Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) course 
 
in progress for members of new South Africa's Maritime Response 
Squadron.  The visit was coordinated through the Pretoria Office of 
Security Cooperation and State Department contractor Northrop 
Grummman:  Training and Simulation Group. 
¶2. (SBU) Naval Attach and POLOFF arrived at Saldanha Naval Base 
(approximately 150 km north of Cape Town) just as a high-level South 
African delegation was leaving the base.  ACOTA team members John 
Kelly, Don Bobo, Tim Westrook, Brian Rich and Bon Linsey greeted us 
and briefed us on their work since November 5th.  The trainers said 
they had been working daily with an average of approximately 30 
members of the Maritime Response Squadron, a number of whom are 
expected to deploy to relieve another unit which is currently 
deployed as part of a specialized UN peacekeeping unit charged with 
maritime interdiction duties in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
¶3. (SBU) The ACOTA teams briefed us on the drowning prevention 
training they had just completed, commenting that only three out of 
thirty trainees were competent to handle themselves in the water 
carrying full gear before the training but all thirty had progressed 
to the point of having full confidence operating in the water. 
Despite the trainees' limited experience with maritime operations, 
the ACOTA team praised their trainees as a reliable unit of good 
marksmen led by an exemplary young ensign.  Emboffs looked on as the 
trainees and their instructors prepared for a boat launching 
exercise. 
¶4.  (SBU) Returning from escorting the visiting South African VIPs, 
Commander Roy Combrink led Naval Attache and POLOFF from the ACOTA 
training to tour a base camp assembled to house 100 Maritime 
Response Squadron members.  The base camp was fully equipped and 
capable of operating for thirty days before being resupplied.  The 
enclosed camp contained comfortable-looking eight-man tents, two-man 
tents, a weight training tent, an cardiovascular exercise tent, 
dining and ablution facilities, waste management, water 
purification, generators, boat repair facilities, fuel bladders, and 
equipment.
