¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Charge hosted a luncheon on June 17 for 
Westinghouse where the company's Technology Transfer and 
Localization Director for its China project show-cased 
Westinghouse's track record for technology transfer localization, 
and punctuality for its nuclear power plants under construction in 
China to a range of relevant SAG officials.  The SAG has reaffirmed 
its commitment to augmenting its nuclear power supply, but is still 
establishing the way forward.  The Mission has organized several 
events to provide commercial advocacy for Westinghouse's bid over 
the last two years.  END SUMMARY.

Commercial Advocacy for Westinghouse 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Charge d'Affaires, Economic Counselor, and Minerals/Energy 
Officer worked with Westinghouse Regional Vice President Rita Bowser 
to organize a luncheon on June 17 for Westinghouse Technology 
Transfer and Localization Director - China Mark Crump to emphasize 
the company's commitment and implementation of its technology 
transfer and localization initiatives in China.  The objective was 
to convey Westinghouse's proven track record and its applicability 
to South Africa to key officials of the SAG as the new government 
assesses its way forward for building new nuclear power plants in 
South Africa.  Officials from the Department of Energy, Department 
of Trade and Industry, Department of Science and Technology, 
Department of Finance, Toshiba, and the Japanese Embassy attended. 
The group represented most of the agencies comprising the SAG 
nuclear task team which will present the nuclear "dossier" to the 
new government in the next few months to establish the way forward. 
Westinghouse has told the Embassy that this is a key period for 
influencing the evolving process (reftel).

Technology Transfer in China 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Crump highlighted its leadership and track record in 
international technology transfer and localization in South Korea, 
China, and other countries.  Westinghouse is working closely with 
the Chinese State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation for ambitious 
technology transfer and localization for its AP1000 technologies in 
China.  The objective is to achieve nuclear power self-reliance for 
Generation III+ passive Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) 
technologies.  Crump remarked that the Chinese are very ambitious in 
the speed of implementing localized capacity, aiming for significant 
domestic production in the third and fourth plants.  Westinghouse 
poured first concrete on time March 31, 2009 at its first Sanmen I 
plant and expects to be ahead of time on the second Haiyang I 
facility.  Westinghouse is successfully implementing a broad-based 
program for transfer of key equipment, sub-supplier, and fuel 
technologies to China. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment: Westinghouse handily pitched China as a template 
for its AP1000 technology transfer, thereby promoting its direct 
applicability to developing the nuclear manufacturing industry in 
South Africa.  The Embassy was instrumental in convincing 
QSouth Africa.  The Embassy was instrumental in convincing 
Westinghouse to bring its China Manager to South Africa to trumpet 
its success in China.  This commercial advocacy success came at a 
key juncture as the new government evaluates where it will go with 
nuclear power.  Coal is perceived as relatively cheap and abundant, 
but the SAG is adopting carbon mitigation and energy diversity as 
greater priorities.  There is also a relative shortage of coal and 
hydro resources in the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces, where the 
future nuclear power plants are to be located.  Westinghouse is 
still in the game.
