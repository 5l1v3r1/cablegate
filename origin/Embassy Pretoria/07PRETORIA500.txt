¶1. (U) This is an action request.  See paragraph 6. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary.  South Africa has requested U.S. assistance 
with developing a U.S.-based energy planning model and seeks 
broader cooperation around energy issues.  The South African 
Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) would like to send 
two senior officials to Washington to meet with U.S. 
Department of Energy (DOE) officials regarding energy 
planning models.  DME has also expressed interest in 
developing a broad agreement around energy issues.  Post 
requests point(s) of contact for DME requests.  End Summary.

A Call for Help 
--------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a February 5 meeting with econoff, DME Nuclear 
Chief Tseliso Maqubela asked econoff for DOE assistance with 
energy planning.  Maqubela said DME wants to adopt the U.S. 
model for energy planning, specifically referencing DOE's 
National Energy Modeling System. He said DME has until May to 
produce a new energy plan.  Maqubela asked to send two senior 
DME officials to Washington DC the following week to meet 
with DOE officials and learn how to adopt the U.S. National 
Energy Modeling System.  Econoff agreed to forward the 
request but said that more time would be needed to prepare 
for the visit.

Broader Cooperation Sought 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Maqubela told econoff that the December 1 meeting 
between DME Minister Buywela Sonjica and DOE Secretary Bodman 
on the margins of the Corporate Council for Africa's Oil and 
Gas Forum in Bethesda went extremely well.  Maqubela said 
that the two agreed to cooperate on energy issues and that 
the use of the energy model was discussed.  Maqubela called 
the meeting represented a "turning point" in U.S./SAG energy 
relations and said we should pursue a broad cooperative 
agreement around all energy issues.  He said that this 
inclusive approach would help deflect the current narrow 
focus on nuclear cooperation agreements which have been 
stalled for several years.  Note: An R&D agreement on Nuclear 
Energy is ready for signature and Maqbela provided a point of 
contact for signature coordination (septel).  End Note. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Maqubela suggested initiating broader energy 
cooperation with an MOU which would describe cooperation 
around hydrocarbons, renewables, nuclear and electricity.  He 
suggested creating a Joint Standing Committee on Nuclear 
Energy Cooperation (JSCNEC).  Maqubela also stated that a 
cooperative agreement between the two countries would be 
viewed favorably in awarding contracts to U.S. companies as 
South Africa engages in a major capital expenditure program 
to increase its power supply. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Action Request:  Post requests a point of contact 
at DOE to respond to DME's request for use of the U.S. energy 
model and a Washington visit.
