¶1. (SBU) Supporters of newly-elected African National 
Congress (ANC) President Jacob Zuma dominated the elections 
for the party's National Executive Council (NEC), the ANC's 
central policymaking body (see para 6 for full results). 
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela received the most votes for the NEC 
(2,845), a largely sentimental vote for the much-loved 
Madikizela-Mandela, followed by Minister of Transport Jeff 
Radebe (2,716) and Minister of Social Development Zola 
Skweyiya (2,700).  A number of key allies of President Mbeki, 
including sixteen Cabinet members, lost their NEC positions. 
However, despite earlier speculation that he might lose, 
Mbeki ally and Finance Minister Trevor Manuel was reelected 
to the Council (in position 57 of 80), as were prominent 
businessman Cyril Ramaphosa (position 30), and presidential 
policy advisor Joel Netshitenzhe (position 73).  ANC 
presidential candidate and recent Zuma supporter Tokyo 
Sexwale garnered 2,198 votes, finishing in 10th position. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Among the prominent ANC members and Mbeki allies 
defeated for reelection to the NEC were: 
 
-- DefMin Mosiuoa "Terror" Lekota, previously ANC Chairman 
and the Mbeki camp candidate for ANC Secretary General, who 
publicly attacked Jacob Zuma in the weeks leading up to the 
ANC conference; 
 
-- Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the Mbeki camp's 
candidate for ANC Treasurer General, whose husband led the 
initial corruption investigation of Zuma; 
 
-- Minister in the Presidency Essop Pahad and his brother 
DepForMin Aziz Pahad, both long-time Mbeki confidantes; 
 
-- Minister of Intelligence Ronnie Kasrils and Minister of 
Public Enterprises Alex Erwin, two of three white ANC 
Ministers (the other, former New National Party leader and 
Minister of Environment and Tourism Marthinus van Schalkwyk, 
was not nominated); 
 
-- Minister of Public Works Thokozile Didiza (Mbeki camp 
candidate for ANC Deputy Secretary General); Minister of 
Provincial and Local Government Sydney Mufamadi; Minister of 
Public Service and Administration Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi; 
Trade and Industry Minister Mandisi Mpahlwa; and Deputy 
Finance Minister Jabu Moleketi; and 
 
-- Director General in the Presidency Frank Chikane; head of 
the ANC Presidency Smuts Ngonyama; and businessman and key 
Mbeki ally Saki Macozoma. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Other developments of note: 
 
-- ANC delegates reelected to the NEC ForMin Nkosazana 
Dlamini-Zuma (position 35), despite her support for Mbeki 
during the presidential campaign.  DepForMin Sue van der 
Merwe (position 54) and Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) 
Deputy Director General for Africa Multilateral Jesse Duarte 
(position 6) were also elected. 
 
-- Controversial Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang was 
reelected (position 55), although she was outpolled by her 
former deputy Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, a first-time NEC 
member (position 33).  Mbeki fired Madlala-Routledge in 
August 2007, ostensibly for traveling without his permission, 
although most analysts believe her outspoken criticism of SAG 
HIV/AIDS policies led to her dismissal. 
 
-- Other ministers who retained their NEC positions include 
Arts and Culture Minister Pallo Jordan (position 4), Housing 
Minister Lindiwe Sisulu (position 7), Justice Minister 
Bridgette Mabandla (position 9), Sports Minister Makhenkesi 
QBridgette Mabandla (position 9), Sports Minister Makhenkesi 
Stofile (position 12), Home Affairs Minister Nosiviwe 
Mapisa-Nqakula (position 68), and Education Minister Naledi 
Pandor (position 74). 
 
-- Only one of the nine provincial premiers, KwaZulu-Natal 
Premier Sbu Ndebele, was reelected to the NEC (position 75).

¶4. (U) This is the largest ANC NEC in history, with 86 
members; it is also for the first time comprised of 50 
percent women.  (NOTE: The NEC comprises of the six ANC 
leadership positions, elected December 18 (ref A), plus the 
80 other members.  END NOTE.)  Both the expanded size and 
mandatory gender parity were approved by conference delegates 
earlier in the week.  Due to the gender requirement, 43 of 
the 69 women nominated to the NEC were elected, as opposed to 
43 of the 96 men. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  With the NEC election, the Zuma camp has 
largely completed its takeover of the ANC party structures 
from Mbeki and his allies.  It is encouraging that the ANC 
delegates voted for FinMin Manuel and ANC policy advisor 
Netshitenzhe, both impressive technocrats, despite their 
pro-Mbeki leanings.  While the ideological center of the NEC 
has moved to left, we do not expect major changes in ANC or 
SAG policy, at least in the short-term (refs B and C).  The 
current crop of SAG ministers, including those voted off the 
NEC, will remain in cabinet and in control of their 
portfolios until national parliamentary elections, currently 
expected in March/April 2009.  Furthermore, just because an 
ANC member is not on the NEC does not mean s/he might not 
emerge in a key position in the next administration.  Should 
Zuma succeed in winning the national presidency in 2009, 
Zuma's aides have told us that they intend to widen the 
separation between party and government and would pick at 
least some members of Zuma's cabinet from outside the ANC 
NEC.  END COMMENT.
