AMCHAM Study on Impact of U.S. Companies 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) AMCHAM has released a summary of its recent study of the 
impact of U.S. business in South Africa.  The 120 companies that 
responded to the survey employed 227,000 South Africans (47,000 
direct and 180,000 indirect), had annual gross sales of $12.4 
billion (R86.8 billion), and spent $83 million (R583.2 million) on 
corporate social investment (CSI) in 2005.  The 47,000 direct 
employees represent 0.65% of total employment in South Africa.  The 
$12.4 billion in gross sales constitutes 3% of total gross sales in 
South Africa, with the largest concentrations in the wholesale and 
retail and manufacturing sectors.  The 105 U.S. companies that have 
CSI programs contributed 22% of all CSI in South Africa.  A majority 
of U.S. companies that responded to an earlier AMCHAM Business 
Climate Survey in 2005 viewed the South African business climate as 
excellent or good and 92% were planning to invest more or the same 
amount of money and either increase or maintain their current number 
of employees.  The recent AMCHAM study is the first of a series of 
projected studies that are designed to provide a more accurate 
picture of U.S. companies in South Africa.  Skills development by 
U.S. companies is the possible topic of the next study. 
 
Eskom Warns About Rising Capital Costs 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) State power company Eskom has warned that the current 
shortage of cement and steel will place pressure on the company's 
planned $13.9 billion (R97 billion) capital investment program. 
Eskom spokesman Fani Zulu said the company was "keeping a watching 
brief" on the effect the upward pressure on prices would have on its 
infrastructure program.   Minister of Public Enterprises Alec Erwin 
said last June that Eskom would need approximately one million tons 
of cement and 60,000 tons of steel per year for its investment 
program for the next five years. The pressure could be worsened by 
the growing global scarcity of electrical equipment as many of the 
world's largest utilities embark on capacity expansion programs 
similar to Eskom's.  On the domestic front, infrastructure expansion 
is underway in several sectors, including highways, ports, airports, 
new mines, and stadiums for the 2010 World Cup.  This will have an 
impact on construction costs and skills shortages throughout the 
economy.  The higher construction costs mean that Eskom may have to 
borrow more money to add to the initial $6.9 billion (R48.5 billion) 
that it planned to borrow from local and international markets. 
This in turn means that customers may have to pay higher tariffs 
from 2009 onwards.  (Business Day, December 12) 
 
Net Foreign Exchange Reserves Increase to $22.17 billion 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4. (U) The SARB's net foreign exchange reserves increased to $22.17 
billion in November.  This was largely the result of a $250 million 
prepayment on a three-year $1 billion syndicated loan taken out in 
2004 and a $148 million increase in the value of the country's gold 
reserves as the average price of gold increased from $602.50 per 
ounce in October to $639.60 per ounce in November.  The large 
foreign interest in domestic acquisitions and mergers should ensure 
that capital inflows remain strong and that reserves will continue 
to rise.  The SARB's international liquidity position still lags 
behind comparable emerging markets.  Net reserves now equal 5 months 
of imports based on 2005 imports of $51 billion. 
 
Plan to Tackle Non-Tariff Barriers in SADC 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
PRETORIA 00005114  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
¶5. (U) Southern African Development Community (SADC) officials and 
local businessmen met recently in Pretoria to develop an action plan 
to tackle non-tariff barriers (NTBs) in the SADC region.  To date, 
SADC countries have focused almost entirely on reduction of tariffs, 
which must be completely eliminated for 85% of goods by 2008, while 
NTBs have been left essentially untouched.  Highlighted problems 
with NTBs included customs administration, high costs of 
transportation due to infrastructure deficiencies, sanitary and 
phytosanitary requirements, cumbersome documentation requirements, 
and trade quotas.  NTBs had the greatest negative impact on 
agricultural items, one of the region's most important products.

South Africa's AGOA Exports Accelerate 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) As of September, South Africa had exported $5.6 billion of 
goods to the U.S. this year, of which $1.3 billion were under AGOA. 
This amount was almost equal to the total value of exports to the 
U.S. for all of 2005, and represented a 30% growth over the same 
period last year.  Much of this growth is attributed to higher 
commodity prices (of the $5.6 billion of goods, $3.9 billion fell 
into the category of "minerals and metals").   While the largest 
value of exports under AGOA came from Nigeria and Angola, almost all 
of these exports are comprised of energy-related products.  South 
Africa's exports to the U.S., on the other hand, are the most 
diversified among the 37 AGOA beneficiary countries.  (Business 
Report Magazine, December 15) 
 
Tourism Peak in Sight as Visitors Flock In 
------------------------------------------ 
¶7. (U) South Africa is set to improve on last year's record-breaking 
7.3-million tourist arrivals.  The number of visitors in September 
increased to 173,348, an 11.2% increase over the same month last 
year.  According to StatsSA figures, 89.9% of the visitors were in 
SA on holiday, while business trips accounted for 4.9%.  The rest 
were either in the country for work or in transit.  With more than 
35,000 visitors, Britain was the leading source of visitors, 
followed by Germany and the U.S. with 22,587 and 21,435, 
respectively.  Travelers from other African countries increased 
11.3% to 469,721.  Statistics SA said 93.9% of African visitors came 
to South Africa for holidays and 1.7% were on business trips.  Last 
year, the 10.3% increase in foreign arrivals to South Africa 
outstripped the global annual increase of 5.5%. (Business day, 
December 20) 
EU-SA Deal on Car Parts May Draw Manufacturers to South Africa 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶8. (U) A trade agreement between SA and the European Union (EU) on 
vehicle products became effective on November 17.  Under the 
agreement, the EU will remove all tariffs on motor components 
manufactured in South Africa.  Duties on completely built-up cars 
will be lowered gradually from the current 10% to 0% by the 
beginning of 2008 (this tariff will apply if vehicles and components 
have a minimum of 60% South African content).  Commercial vehicle 
exports are already duty-free but tariffs were imposed on South 
African-manufactured components this year.  In terms of the 
agreement, these tariffs will be lifted.  SA last year exported more 
than R20billion ($3 billion) of car-related products to the EU, 
while it imported automotive goods worth R38billion ($5.5 billion). 
On its side, SA duties on completely built-up cars and light 
commercial vehicles will be phased down to 18% by 2012, compared 
with the present 25%.  (Business Day, December 18) 
 
Social Grants Carry SA Forward 
------------------------------ 
 
¶9. (U) The government's broad social welfare system (old age grants, 
war veterans' grants, disability grants, care dependency grants, 
foster care grants and grants in aid) has made inroads into poverty 
in South Africa.  According to the FinMark Trust's Finscope study, 
30% of households lived below the poverty line ($1 per day) in 2004 
with social grants constituting their main source of income, while 
roughly the same percentage lived on remittances from relatives. 
Last year the proportion of households living on social grants 
dropped to 25% and only 15% were surviving on remittances.  The 2006 
budget provided an additional R2.7 billion ($0.4 billion) for social 
assistance grants.  About 10 million South Africans depend on social 
grants. (Business Day, December 15)

Biofuels conference in Cape Town 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  (U) An inaugural Biofuels Markets Africa conference took place 
in Cape Town on November 30 - December 1, 2006.  The event attracted 
over 200 attendees, primarily from African industry and governments. 
 Key topics included government policies and incentives to support 
investment, production quality standards, Africa's potential for 
biofuels, and opportunities under the Kyoto Protocol Clean 
Development Mechanism.  Most speakers presented an upbeat view of 
both the market and Africa's potential within the market.  However, 
almost all the speakers noted the need for regional standards and 
policy frameworks, none of which are currently in existence.  SADC 
is working on a framework which could be in effect within two to 
four years.
