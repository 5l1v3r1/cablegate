(SBU) DFA Deputy Director Nuclear Disarmament and 
Non-Proliferation Michiel Combrink informed Energy Officer on 
October 1 that the SAG will be ready to sign the long-awaited 
bilateral Agreement on Cooperation in R&D in Nuclear Energy 
(reftels) in about four weeks pending final processing of SAG 
approval to sign.  (Embassy submitted DOE's final, mostly 
editorial changes, to the SAG by diplomatic note on June 10.) 
 The SAG is ready to discuss signing modalities.  The 
Department of Minerals and Energy previously told Economic 
Counselor that the SAG would prefer to sign this agreement at 
the ministerial level.  The SAG views signing the bilateral 
agreement as a precursor to launching a Joint Standing 
Committee on Nuclear Energy Cooperation (JSCNEC), also in 
discussion for an extended period.
