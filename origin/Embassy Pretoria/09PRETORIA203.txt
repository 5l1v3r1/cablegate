Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU)  The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) launched its party 
manifesto before a small, heavily guarded crowd in Soweto on 
January 25.  IFP leaders spoke briefly about the party's 
agenda -- economic growth, job creation, law and order, 
education, health, land reform, and morality -- before 
turning over the podium to venerable leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi.  The crowd, estimated between 4,000 and 5,000 by 
the media and foreign diplomats, cheered each speaker but 
saved its loudest applause for Buthelezi.  The 80-year old 
IFP leader showed few signs of slowing down and looks poised 
to carry the party through this election.  End Summary.

IFP Launches Manifesto in Soweto 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U)  The IFP launched its party manifesto before a crowd 
estimated at between 4,000 and 5,000 cheering supporters in 
Pimville in Soweto on January 25.  The police presence inside 
and outside the stadium in Pimville was substantial, as 
organizers were concerned there would be violence between IFP 
and African National Congress (ANC) sympathizers after the 
event.  (Note: Poloffs saw no sign of violence and even saw 
IFP members, wearing t-shirts and hats, shopping at the posh 
Maponya Mall with little regard for their own security.  End 
Note.)  Inside the stadium, party supporters sat on the 
ground while party leaders and guests sat under a covered 
staging area surrounded by a fence.  One observer noted, "The 
leaders sitting in staging area really do not resemble those 
in the crowd.  Here I see blacks, whites, and Indians.  On 
the field, I see only blacks.  This could be a problem for 
the party at the polls."  The crowd cheered the religious 
leaders and party leaders such as Youth Brigade President Pat 
Lebenya-Ntanzi and Women's Brigade President Thembi Nzuza 
that opened the event.  Lebenya-Ntanzi and Nzuza addressed 
the crowd both in English and Zulu.  Following their remarks, 
Buthelezi took the stage to sustained applause.  He opened 
his address by thanking the crowd for the opportunity to 
continue "a dialogue with Soweto."

Buthelezi Discusses the IFP Manifesto 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U)  Buthelezi's address underscored how the IFP's 
manifesto reads like a treatise rather than a election 
program.  The IFP chief delivered the same address both in 
English and Zulu, talking for roughly one hour, and noted 
what the party would focus on and how it would achieve its 
vision.  (Note:  For more information see the IFP website at 
ww.ifp.org.za.  End Note.)  He expounded on some of the 
party's agenda during his remarks; at times, he flailed his 
arms and waved his hands to make his points.  On economic 
growth, he said the party could achieve eight percent growth 
per year.  He noted, "The IFP does not advocate unbridled, 
laissez faire capitalism associated with a minimalist state." 
 However, he claimed the party wants to pursue greater 
foreign direct investment and an industrial policy that 
promotes manufactured exports." 
 
¶4. (U)  When he discussed law and order, Buthelezi took 
several shots at the ANC's policies of disbanding the 
Scorpions and undermining the judiciary.  He said, "We need 
to protect the integrity and independence of the judiciary 
and retain or reinstate the Scorpions."  He also warned that 
Qand retain or reinstate the Scorpions."  He also warned that 
the police are becoming "too politicized."  On education, he 
called for better regulation of South Africa's textbook 
industry and the restructuring of the Outcomes Based 
Education program.  He lashed out at the Jacob Zuma-led ANC 
over health care, noting that the ruling party has done far 
too little to combat HIV.  He said that his first step as 
national leader would be to declare HIV a national crisis. 
He tied health care into the country's "loss of morality." 
 
¶5. (U)  Buthelezi met with the media after speaking to the 
crowd.  He elaborated on the party's agenda and described how 
pleased he was with the turnout for the launch.  An 
interesting moment occurred during the session when the South 
 
PRETORIA 00000203  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) asked Buthelezi on 
live television to explain his party's manifesto.  The 
reporter posed the question, but Buthelezi apparently did not 
hear the question and continued looking away from the camera. 
 After about ten seconds, the reporter posed the same 
question and the IFP chief finally responded.  The episode 
served to remind those in the room that despite Buthelezi's 
energy, he is 80.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  The party's campaign agenda mirrors what its 
leaders have both pushed publicly and shared with US 
diplomats in recent months.  The party has chosen to maintain 
its leadership intact even as political analysts and pundits 
say the IFP needs to deal with succession sooner rather than 
later.  Failure to deal with succession transparently may be 
the biggest detriment to the IFP's hopes for success at the 
polls.  (Note:  See Reftels for more information on the IFP's 
goals for this election.  End Note.)  As the SABC interview 
showed, Buthelezi is getting older whether the party wants 
him to or not.
