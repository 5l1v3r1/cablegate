SUBJECT: TEXT OF FATWA ISSUED BY MUQTADA AL-SADR IN RESPONSE TO 
EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK 
 
¶1. (U) On April 11, Muqtada Al-Sadr issued a fatwa in response 
to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's comments questioning the 
loyalty of Iraqi Shi'a. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin Text (translated by REO Hillah local staff): 
 
By the Name of God: 
 
Your Excellency the Leader of Islam and Muslims: 
Within this conflict that is lived by the sons of this injured 
country and within the latest events, and while many of the 
rioters increased attempts to spread rumors that divide the 
ethnicities of the country, and with the absence of voices that 
call for unity and to stop bloodshed on this sacred country. 
 
Iraqis are surprised by the latest statements of the Egyptian 
president Hosni Mubarak, in which he accused the sons of the 
Islamic Shi'a of loyalty to Iran and disloyalty to their 
country. As a son of this entity we would like you to give your 
opinion against this claim which came from a known political 
figure in the Arabic and international community. 
 
Group of the Islamic Shi'a 
April 11, 2006 
 
Muqtada: 
 
By the name of God: 
 
"if we go back in Shi'a history we shall see Shi'a belief is the 
loyalty to the prophet Mohammed and his family, the source of 
the loyalty is in Medina first, and Najaf second. So we can then 
say the Shi'a in Iran are followers of Iraq since the Imam Ali 
lived in Kufa and is buried in Najaf. 
 
As Muslims, our loyalty is to Islam and as Arabs our loyalty is 
to the Arabs, but those such as the Egyptian president have no 
knowledge of these fields and they forget that relationships 
with any Islamic country is not shameful. Shameful and forbidden 
is the loyalty to the ominous trinity of America, the United 
Kingdom, and Israel, and partnership with Zionists and the 
American invaders. So I'm surprised to hear that some claim they 
are Arab. Does "Arab" mean your loyalty to this trinity? 
 
Many Sunni Arabs follow the scholars in Saudi and in Azhar 
(Cairo) but that does not mean they are loyal to these 
countries. The Shi'a religious center is in Najaf. 
 
I advise all Arabs, as a nation and as government that Iraq is 
in a difficult period that requires their support so that Iraq 
shall not be dragged into ethnic an civil wars. Such statements 
serve nobody except the enemy and ignite the civil war that 
Iraqis have moved away from due to their knowledge of the risks. 
 
So the son of Omar be assured that sons of Ali and Mahdi are 
your brothers in Islam and I shall always work to assure you 
from the Shi'a and their governance that we reject Iranaian 
influence and the Iranian-American negotiations to show evidence 
of Shi'a loyalty to their country.
