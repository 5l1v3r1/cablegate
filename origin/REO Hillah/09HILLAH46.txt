SUBJECT: NEW ANTI-DAWA COALITION CONTROLS MAJORITY OF BABIL 
PROVINCIAL COUNCIL VOTES 
 
¶1.      (U)  This is a PRT Babil cable. 
 
 
 
¶2.      (SBU) Summary and Comment:  On Sunday, August 9, 2009, 
Iraqi press reported the formation of a new coalition of 18 
members of the Babil provincial council called the Babil 
National Coalition formed in opposition to the ruling DAWA 
coalition.  We have verified that the number in the news was 
incorrect; there are 16 members in the new coalition.  16 PC 
votes constitute the majority necessary to remove the Governor 
from office if the PC were to pursue that course of action per 
the procedures in Law 21.  PRT-Babil heard a different 
interpretation of the intent of the new coalition from Sheikh 
Ali Shanan (reported via email) and we are looking further into 
this issue.  The PRT is requesting a meeting with Deputy 
Governor Witwit for later this week.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
 
 
¶3.      (U) The new coalition reportedly included members of 
Shaheed Al-Mihrab (ISCI), Iraqi commission of NGOs (Iskander 
Slate), Iraqi National Slate (Sabah Allawi), Independent Ansar 
Bloc (Mohammed Al-Masoudi Slate), and Justice Independent Slate. 
 The new coalition did not include the State of Law coalition 
(DAWA), Ahrar Independent Trend (Sadrists) or National Reform 
Trend (Dr. Jaafari Slate). 
 
 
 
¶4.      (U) The new coalition members held a press conference at 
the Al-Dhikrayat hotel in Hillah August 9 at which they 
distributed a press release stating that the aims of the new 
coalition were ensuring all views are heard in the political 
process in Babil, stopping corruption, and improving delivery of 
services. 
 
 
 
¶5.      (U) Some of members of the new coalition have denied any 
ambition to remove or dismiss local officials in the Governorate 
or Provincial Council.  Babil Deputy Governor Iskander Witwit 
(independent) reportedly stated that the new coalition was 
formed to combat dictatorship and exclusion of some views from 
local government.  Former Provincial Council Chairman Mohammed 
Al-Masoudi (Independent Ansar Bloc) expressed his opposition to 
any separation inside the Council because of the formation of 
this new coalition, stressing the necessity to maintain the 
strength of the Council. 
 
 
 
¶6.      (U) The members of the new coalition reportedly believed 
that they had been excluded from decision making and denied 
responsibilities. Mr. Rasool Hamzah (independent), a PRDC member 
who is also the nephew of the Governor, reportedly believed that 
new coalition members would try to remove the Governor because 
he had not acceded to the PC request that the province buy a car 
for each PC member. 
 
 
 
¶7.      (U) Deputy Governor Mr. Sadiq Rasool (National Reform 
Trend) reportedly denied that the PC members forming the new 
coalition had been excluded from the political process.  He also 
indicated that he believed that the new coalition members formed 
the new coalition with the best interests of Babil province in 
mind, and that they do not plan to remove the Governor from his 
position.  Deputy Governor Rasool commented that the Governor 
had not refused to buy cars for the PC members -- he just would 
like to find a legal basis for purchasing these cars.
