SUBJECT: WASIT PROVINCAL FINANCES: TREASURY, PROVINCIAL COUNCIL AND 
GOVERNOR PREPARED TO SPEND IRAQI RECONSTRUCTION FUNDS. 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  In a April 12 meeting with Regional Embassy 
Office staff, Wasit Provincial Treasurer Lu'ay Allah Wardi 
described procedures instituted by the Wasit provincial 
government to obligate and disburse the Regional Development and 
Rapid Reconstruction funds allocated to the province by the 
Baghdad Ministry of Finance. Overall, provincial authorities 
appear to have the technical capacity to receive and obligate 
the funds, as well as meet central government imposed reporting 
requirements.  Less certain is the ability of provincial 
authorities to monitor reconstruction contracts for satisfactory 
performance. Wardi, however, indicated that additional employees 
sent to the province by the Ministry of Finance were 
ill-prepared for their jobs and required additional training. 
END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (SBU) Wardi said that he, Wasit Governor Lateef Turfa, and 
members of the Provincial Council (PC) had opened two separate 
bank accounts. The first account is designated for the receipt 
of funds from the Regional Development allocation and is 
controlled by the Governor. The second account will hold funds 
from the Rapid Reconstruction allocation and is controlled by 
the PC Chairman. Wardi does not foresee problems with this 
arrangement as the respective Directors General would be 
required to approve contracts and projects in their sector. 
 
¶3. (SBU) A list of planned projects has already been forwarded 
to the ministries of Finance and Planning, according to Wardi. 
Many contractors have already received an advance of seven 
percent, as specified by Iraqi contracting regulations.  Wardi 
did not know if any of the projects slated for this fiscal year 
would be greater than USD one million and thus require approval 
of a subcommittee of the Council of Ministers. However, he was 
confident, that the PC had enough projects pending to obligate 
the entirety of both accounts by the end of the FY 06. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Wasit Deputy Governor, according to Wardi, is 
heavily involved in the contract oversight process, often 
conducting site visits personally. Television stations in Wasit 
also report heavily on the award of contracts and reconstruction 
progress. Wardi did not know if other provincial council member 
or Directors General were involved in contract oversight 
 
¶5. (SBU) Of the seven additional accounting personnel promised 
to the province by the Ministry of Finance, only four have 
arrived, and they are young and poorly trained, Wardi related. 
He is conducting additional training personally and does not 
foresee problems in meeting his accounting and reporting 
obligations. Wardi also reported that he expects to be connected 
to the electronic Financial Management Information System in the 
near future. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT: Wardi is an experienced manager of Wasit's 
finances with over 40 years of government service in the 
province. His judgment that the Wasit provincial government has 
the technical capability to obligate the two main Iraqi 
reconstruction funds is likely accurate. More troubling is the 
apparent lack of an established plan for oversight of the 
contracts. REO staff will raise this issue with the Deputy 
Governor within the next week. The technical ability to spend 
the money, however, does not mean the Provincial Council has 
developed a plan for reconstruction that adequately takes into 
account the needs of the entire province, particularly the 
often-neglected mixed Sunni-Shi'a areas of Northwest Wasit. 
Given the domination of the Provincial Council by members from 
provincial capital of Al-Kut and the presence of several 
prominent general contractors on the PC, this will be a 
challenge.END COMMENT
