SUBJECT: KARBALA: HOSTS MUNICIPALITIES CONFERENCE AND OIL MINISTER 
 
¶1. (U) This is a PRT Karbala cable. 
 
¶2. (U) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: This week Karbala's elected 
government officials appear to be more publicly pursuing 
reconstruction projects and efforts, perhaps in preparation for 
provincial elections.  The Governor hosted the first regional 
municipality conference focused on improving public service 
delivery and included the participation of delegations from 
Wasit, Najaf, Diwaniyah and Babil.  Oil Minister, Hussain 
Sharistani visited Karbala to preside over the formal ribbon 
cutting and laying of the foundation stone for a processed oil 
storage facility.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
3.(U) On July 14 and 15 the Karbala Government hosted a 
conference on municipal services.  More than 150 civil servants 
and elected officials from Diwaniyah, Babil, Najaf and Wasit 
joined the host delegation from Karbala to discuss public 
service delivery.  The delegations presented their best 
practices on public works and collectively established a 
regional municipality coordination committee.  Central 
government participation included the Ministry of 
Municipalities, Information Technology Office and Iraqi 
Parliament member Muthihr al-Hakeem.  Conference outcomes 
included a decision to privatize waste collection and plans to 
increase private sector involvement in public service delivery. 
The five provinces appealed to the central government 
representatives for assistance with several points: more and 
coordination committee's first task is to develop 
multi-provincial projects such as transfer stations, landfills 
and recycling centers. 
 
4.(U) On July 23, the Minister of Oil, Dr. Husain al-Sharistani 
and Parliament representative Mudher al-Hakeem laid the 
foundation stone for an oil product storage facility.  It will 
store an estimated 64 million liters of improved benzene and 20 
million liters of white kerosene and LPG to meet the fuel needs 
of Karbala.  The completion of this project will precede the oil 
refinery that was promised to Karbala in September 2006.  The 
oil refinery project is promised to process 150 thousand barrels 
daily and provide four of the five south central provinces 
(specifically: Najaf, Babil, and Diwaniyah) with needed fuel.
