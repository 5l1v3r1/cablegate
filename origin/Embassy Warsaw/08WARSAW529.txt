REF: STATE 40180 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Econoff raised reftel points on Zimbabwe chairing 
the Commission on Sustainable Development with Mariusz 
Lewicki, Head of the Department of United Nations System and 
Global Affairs in the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
Lewicki stated that Poland's thinking on the Zimbabwe 
chairmanship was in line with the views contained in reftel. 
He agreed that the commission's credibility suffers from the 
current chairmanship, and that some action was appropriate. 
However, he said that the composition of Poland's delegation 
to CSD-16 had not yet been selected.  He said he would notify 
the embassy when a decision had been made on the rank of the 
delegation head. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Econoff also discussed reftel with Slawomir 
Gurtowski, Assistant Director of the Department of Global 
Environmental Problems and Climate Change in Poland's 
Ministry of Environment.  Gurtowski agreed that Zimbabwe was 
not an appropriate choice to head the commission.  He was 
concerned, however, that sending a lower-ranking delegation 
to CSD-16 might send a signal that the work of the commission 
was not considered important.  Moreover, he acknowledged that 
the composition of the delegation would be determined by the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and not by the Ministry of 
Environment.
