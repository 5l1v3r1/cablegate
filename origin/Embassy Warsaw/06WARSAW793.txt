REF: WARSAW 736 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  There have been no new outbreaks of AI in Poland during 
the past week.  The infected and surveillance zones in 
Swinoujscie and Torun have been lifted, and the areas have 
been declared free of AI. 
 
¶2.  Between April 18-22 the Polish Veterinary Service, with 
the assistance of police, fire, military, and local 
authorities, participated in a response to a simulated AI 
outbreak in a commercial flock.  170 personnel from different 
parts of Poland participated.  400 birds (already slated for 
the slaughterhouse) were euthanized by carbon dioxide and the 
poultry facility was disinfected afterward.  Authorities were 
pleased with the efficiency and coordination exhibited during 
the exercise.
