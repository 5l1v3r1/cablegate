INFORMATION EXCHANGE 
 
REF: STATE 190832 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Through various interviews with GOP 
officials, Post obtained the following responses to reftel 
questions on databases, watchlists, information sharing and 
biometrics.  In response to reftel question, given the 
information below, Poland appears to be a valid partner for 
data sharing.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
Immigration Databases 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) As far as we have been able to determine, Poland has 
no immigration database that tracks entries and exits. 
However, the Polish Border Guard maintains a database which 
gathers information on "someRQ'ZQKk~| as instructed by Polish courts or other 
"authorized" institutions.  Fingerprints from applicants for 
refugee status are checked against an EU-wide refugee/asylee 
computer database.  The database does not contain criminal or 
security-related data.  Individuals who have applied as 
refugees in another EU country are, per the Dublin II 
regulations, returned to the EU country of first application. 
 There are no regular criminal checks on refugees/asylum 
seekers. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Watchlists and Information Sharing 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Polish Border Guards maintain an index of aliens 
whose residence in Poland is considered undesirable.  This 
index is updated daily and is also made available to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs for transmission to Polish 
consular officers to use in visa screening.  Poland also 
employs "No Fly" lists from the Transportation Security 
Administration, at least for flights to the U.S. 
 
¶4. (SBU) We understand that various Polish government 
entities hold other lookout or watchlist type information. 
However, information sharing between agencies is not 
automated and requests for information held by one agency 
must be made in writing or by phone by the requesting agency. 
 
¶5. (SBU) When Poland accedes to the Schengen Agreement on 
December 31, 2007, this case-by-case method of communication 
will be replaced by the Schengen Information System, an 
international interagency database, which will include the 
following information: 
 
-    Persons wanted for arrest for extradition purposes; 
-    Persons refused entry based on a threat to public order 
or national security, such as: aliens with convictions; 
aliens suspected of committing serious offenses, or proven to 
intend to commit such offenses; aliens deported, removed or 
expelled; aliens who have disappeared; aliens who need to be 
placed in a place of safety; witnesses; aliens who are 
summoned to appear before the judicial authorities or to 
serve a custodial sentence; 
-    Persons or vehicles to assist prosecution of criminal 
offenses and to assist in the prevention of threats to public 
safety; 
-    Objects sought for seizure or for evidence in criminal 
proceedings; 
-    Police or security checks conducted on refugees/asylees 
 
---------- 
Biometrics 
---------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) According to Colonel Leszek Buja, Deputy Director of 
Border Traffic, Polish Border Guard, "There are no biometric 
systems functioning at Polish points of entry."  However, 
Polish authorities plan to install them in the near future. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Poland began producing ICAO compliant biometric 
diplomatic e-passports in March 2006 and regular biometric 
e-passports in early September 2006.  The biometric is a 
facial image, stored on a chip.  In order to meet EU 
requirements, all Polish biometric e-passports will include 
fingerprints by June 2009.  Authorities have already started 
a pilot program scanning applicants' fingers on a trial basis 
at two of the country's passport offices.  In the future, 
retinal scans may possibly be added. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Since June 2001, all regular Polish passports have 
digital photos and are machine-readable.  Digital photos and 
 
machine readable strips have been included in Polish 
diplomatic passports only since January 2006.
