President-elect Obama from Janusz Sniadek, President of the 
Polish Independent and Self-Governing Trade Union 
"Solidarnosc". 
 
¶2. Begin text: 
 
Dear Mr. President, 
 
On behalf of the Polish Independent and Self-Governing Trade 
Union "Solidarnosc," I would like to convey our sincere 
congratulations and best wishes on the occasion of the 
election for President of the United States of America. 
 
We share the faith of millions of Americans as well as our 
friends from AFL-CIO that as President you will act as an 
advocate of peace, freedom and democracy - the values that 
also we defended twenty years ago in our union's fight 
against communism; in a fight for independent and democratic 
Poland where human rights are abided by. 
 
You have said in your inaugural speech that "America is a 
friend of every nation and every man." These words make us 
believe that policy adopted by you will be a policy of dialog 
and peace. 
 
We are fully aware of challenges that America as well as the 
rest of the world are facing today.  Therefore, we wish you 
success in overcoming all these obstacles together with the 
entire American nation and in dialog with AFL-CIO. 
 
Mr. President, you are bringing home a better world.  We wish 
you every success in carrying out your mission and the best 
of luck in realization of expectations and hopes pinned upon 
you. 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
Janusz Sniadek 
President
