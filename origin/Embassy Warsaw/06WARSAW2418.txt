SUBJECT: POLAND FINALIZES GAS DEALS WITH ROSUKRENERGO AND 
GAZPROM 
 
¶1.  (U)  Polish Oil and Gas Company PGNIG signed a contract 
with RosUkrEnergo for gas imports beginning January 1, 2007. 
The contract is for 2.5 BCM of gas per year for three years 
with the possibility of prolonging the deal for another two. 
The price is based on the price of oil derivative products on 
the global market.  Poland's current contract with 
RosUkrEnergo will expire December 31.  At current market 
prices, the contract is valued at 2 billion zloty ($673 
million). 
 
¶2.  (U)  At the same time, PGNiG signed an annex to its 1996 
Yamal gas contract with Gazprom.  Sources indicate that the 
revised annex will increase gas prices on average 10 percent. 
 Other contract conditions remain unchanged.  At current 
market prices, the contract is valued at 6.7 billion zloty 
($2.2 billion). 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Comment:  PGNiG's conclusion of a three year 
contract with RosUkrEnergo and addendum with Gazprom is good 
news for the GOP and Polish consumers.  The contracts should 
ensure that gas will continue to flow on January 1 as the 
company's negotiations will not go down to the wire.  The 
contracts also give the GOP breathing space as it attempts to 
negotiate other deals that will improve Poland's long-term 
energy security.
