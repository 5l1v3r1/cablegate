¶1. (U) As previewed Ref A, The Polish Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs issued the following public statement on UNSCR 1701 
on August 12: 
 
BEGIN TEXT 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomes with pleasure the 
unanimous passage by the UN Security Council of the 
resolution regarding the cessation of military operations in 
the Middle East.  We express our hope that both sides in the 
conflict will comply with the provisions of the resolution , 
which will allow a suspension of the growing conflict and 
will open a road to its resolution. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs notes with satisfaction the 
passages in the resolution regarding a broadening of the 
mandate and an increase in the potential of the existing UN 
peacekeeping mission in Lebanon. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms Poland's interest in 
maintaining its long-standing participation in the UN Interim 
Force in Lebanon.  A decision regarding any eventual increase 
in our engagement will be taken following a detailed analysis 
of the new situation and after appropriate consultations with 
our partners. 
 
Andrzej Sados, Press Spokesman, Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
of the Republic of Poland

¶2. (U) In an interview appearing August 14 in the Polish 
daily Dziennik, MFA U/S Witold Waszczykowski stated that, 
should the GOP take the decision to deploy additional troops 
to Lebanon, there were sufficient personnel available for the 
mission, because fewer troops would be necessary than had 
been originally planned for Poland's deployment to 
Afghanistan next year.  (N.B. Poland was originally scheduled 
to take over the rotating ISAF command in 2007.  The switch 
to a Consolidated Command has resulted in a decrease in the 
number of Polish personnel required for their ISAF 
commitment, from roughly 1000 down to roughly 700.)
