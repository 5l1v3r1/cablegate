¶1. (SBU) While not familiar with the U.S. proposal for the 
harmonization of conditions of service at the UN, MFA UN 
Department Counselor Dariusz Manczyk told poloff December 15 
he is familiar with the current system's problems.  Manczyk 
was pessimistic about the prospects for a quick solution. 
Developing countries have little interest in reforms since 
they are not major contributors to UN budgets.  Manczyk, who 
was previously assigned to the GoP's UN missions in Geneva 
and New York, undertook to study the U.S. proposal and to 
consult with Polish officials in New York. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Manczyk said he assumed we would also want to 
discuss the salary increase requested by UN tribunal judges. 
He argued that the request is unreasonable because judges 
already earn high wages compared to others in the UN system. 
He lamented that developing countries support the raises 
because they do not have to pay for them.
