SUBJECT: POLAND SUES EU OVER CO2 LIMITS 
 
REF: WARSAW 1179 
 
(U) On May 25, Poland filed a protest with the European Court 
of Justice (ECJ) against the EU regarding the limits imposed 
on CO2 emissions for Poland under the European Emissions 
Trading Scheme.  This move comes as a surprise, as Polish 
Emissions Trading Officials previously told Econoff (reftel) 
that they would not/not file such a claim.  Although it is 
unclear what changed the GOP,s decision, the protest claims 
that the EU used growth projections from when Poland joined 
the EU in 2004 to calculate emissions allocations, and 
Poland,s growth has far exceeded those rates.  Therefore, 
the GOP believes that Poland deserves a higher allocation to 
allow for its increased growth.  It is asking for 284 million 
tons of CO2, while the EU allocated 208.5 million tons. 
Poland is the second of the EU Member States to file such a 
protest, the Czech Republic filed one almost immediately 
after the new allocations were announced.
