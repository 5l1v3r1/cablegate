¶1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified, not for internet 
distribution. 
 
¶2. (U) The Ambassador paid an introductory call on new 
Minister of Construction, Andrzej Aumiller on December 7. 
During the meeting, Aumiller explained his hope to build 3 
million housing units in Poland over the next eight years, 
claiming that such a number is necessary to catch up to EU 
standards.  Aumiller stated that Poland currently has 330 
units per 1000 people, and his goal is to raise that to 540 
units per 1000 people.  He noted that the biggest obstacle to 
such development is disputes over land ownership which need 
to be sorted out before building can begin.  However, 
Aumiller is motivated by the economic growth Poland is 
experiencing and hopes that will translate into additional 
funding for government-subsidized housing for the poor. 
Aumiller proposed spending 2.5 billion PLN (USD 800 million) 
over the next 8 years on housing, saying that 220 million PLN 
(USD 70 million) is already allocated for 100,000 units in 
¶2007. 
 
¶3. (U) Aumiller acknowledged that there is a lack of skilled 
construction workers in Poland, claiming that the best 
technicians have left to work in other EU countries.  He 
hopes that increased salaries in the sector will attract some 
of those workers back.  He also hopes that increased salaries 
and EU job training funds will encourage miners and farmers 
to switch to construction. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Ambassador brought to Aumiller's attention the 
case of AIG Lincoln, an American company that has been 
attempting to build a housing development in Raszyn, a suburb 
of Warsaw, for years (reftels).  AIG has run into numerous 
obstacles, most of them centered around the former mayor of 
Raszyn.  Since the mayor recently lost his bid for 
re-election, the Ambassador expressed hope that things will 
progress faster with the newly elected mayor.  Aumiller 
offered to look into the case if AIG appealed its denial of a 
construction permit to the Minister (Aumiller himself). 
Aumiller stated that he would do what he can if the case is 
not yet in court.  If the case is already in court, then he 
cannot get involved.  Econoff made AIG aware of Aumiller's 
offer and AIG is considering how to proceed. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  Throughout the meeting Aumiller did most 
of the talking, not allowing the Ambassador to interject on 
multiple occasions.  Aumiller also cut off the interpreter on 
numerous occasions, sometimes rudely.  Although he seems to 
have passion for his new portfolio, his style does not 
encourage others to join his cause.  End Comment. 
 
¶6. (U) Background:  The Ministry of Construction was created 
in May 2006 when PiS (Law and Justice Party) signed new 
coalition agreements with Samobrona (Self-Defense) and LPR 
(League of Polish Families).  It was separated from the 
Ministry of Transport and the new Minister was appointed from 
the Self-Defense party.  Andrzej Aumiller was appointed 
Minister of Construction on November 3, 2006, the third 
Self-Defense member to hold this position since the 
Ministry's creation in May.  The Ministry handles housing 
management, housing finance, the real estate market, spatial 
planning and architecture, city policy and revitalization, 
the construction market, and construction jurisdiction.  End 
Background.
