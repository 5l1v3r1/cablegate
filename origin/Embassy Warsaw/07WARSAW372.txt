¶1.  (U)  SUMMARY. Post co-sponsored the Polish premiere of Al Gore's 
movie on global warming, "An Inconvenient Truth," and used the 
occasion to articulate U.S. policy on climate change and to 
highlight USG efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  The 
screening, at an environmental and clean energy trade fair February 
13, enabled post to reach an eager audience of nearly 200 
environmentally conscious Poles, while delivering an important 
message of USG concern for the environment and involvement in 
addressing the issue. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Due to PAS's film distributor contacts waiving screening 
fees for the film prior to its public release in Poland, post was 
able to support the Polish premiere of "An Inconvenient Truth."  The 
concept of collaborating on this project was spawned at a reception 
hosted by Charge iho CEQ Chairman Connaughton during his visit to 
Poland last October. Organizers of the fair attended the reception 
and raised the idea with PAS officers as a possible area for 
cooperation; this project is a direct result of engagement in public 
diplomacy associated with CEQ's itinerary to Poland. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Econoff introduced the film to approximately 175 ENEX fair 
attendees, while also speaking about USG efforts to reduce 
greenhouse gases.  Econoff relied heavily on reftels and various 
resources recently sent via PD channels in crafting remarks. 
Remarks were well received, as was the film.  Audience members were 
extremely thankful for the opportunity to see the film and were 
eager to engage in discussions on how Poland can do more to combat 
global warming.  Audience members seemed pleasantly surprised to 
learn of USG efforts and gave thought to how Poland may be able to 
adapt similar measures, particularly in regard to consumer choices, 
i.e. energy efficient improvements to homes, and lower emissions 
vehicles. 
 
¶4.  (U)  The ENEX Environmental and Clean Energy Trade Fair was held 
in Kielce, Poland February 12-14.  With over 120 businesses 
represented and over 4000 attendees, ENEX is aiming to grow into the 
largest fair of its kind in Poland.  However, there was a noticeable 
absence of American companies.  Fair organizers are hoping to work 
with post to encourage U.S. companies to attend the fair next year. 
Ideally, fair organizers would like to highlight U.S. clean energy 
technologies through an "American Day" at next year's trade fair. 
Econoff will work with post's Foreign Commercial Service to explore 
such possibilities.
