¶1.  (SBU) Poloff met October 2 with Beata Stoczynska, Acting 
Director, and Krzysztof Ciebien, Minister Counsellor from the 
Asia-Pacific Department of the MFA to deliver reftel points 
on Burma. Stoczynska confirmed that Poland is pushing within 
the framework of the EU to keep pressure on the Burmese 
regime to guarantee the population's human rights, and to 
secure the release of Aun Sun Suu Kyi. Meetings are currently 
taking place within the COREPER channels.  Stoczynska did not 
expect any further action before the October 15 GAERC meeting 
in Brussels, where Burma is one of the leading topics for 
foreign ministers. Sanctions are on the agenda of the GAERC 
meeting, however, Stoczynska expressed Polish concerns that 
tightening sanctions not hurt the general population. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ciebien also emphasized the need to put pressure on 
neighboring countries to help stop the violence. They asked 
for up-to-date information on the situation, as the GOP does 
not have representation in Burma. Ciebien wished to know the 
USG opinion regarding other ASEAN countries' willingness to 
maintain pressure on Rangoon.  Ciebien also asked what the 
U.S. position would be if Burma were to withdraw from ASEAN. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Polish MFA issued a statement on Burma on 
September 27 decrying the Burmese authorities' violence 
against peaceful protestors.  The Polish statement endorses 
EU efforts concerning Burma, and urges an immediate process 
of national reconciliation to restore democracy and human 
rights.
