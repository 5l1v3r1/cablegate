SUBJECT: POLAND - NO REPORTS OF FORCED CHILD LABOR IN 
PRODUCTION OF GOODS 
 
REF: STATE 21472 
 
There are no reports of forced child labor or exploitative 
child labor in the production of goods in Poland.  We 
inquired with the Ministry of the Interior and 
Administration, the Children's Rights Ombudsman's office, the 
Center for Human Trafficking at Warsaw University (which 
recently did a study with ILO on forced labor in Poland), 
Nobody's Children Foundation (the leading NGO on children's 
issues), and LaStrada (Poland's leading NGO on trafficking). 
None of these organizations was aware of any cases in Poland.
