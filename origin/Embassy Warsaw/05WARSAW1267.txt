¶1. (SBU) During a meeting on other issues, the Iraqi 
Ambassador to Poland, Hussein Shialtagh, commented that the 
Iraqi Embassy in Poland is trying to build closer military, 
commercial, and civic relations with Poland.  He said that 
while the military relationship is already quite robust due 
to Poland's presence in Iraq and the success of some Polish 
defense companies, a strong civic relationship between the 
two states has not yet developed.  Shialtagh said that he 
believes increased civic and commercial ties between Iraq and 
Poland would help the Polish government justify greater 
military and security ties with Iraq.  To this end, the Iraqi 
Embassy is trying to develop several programs with Poland. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Foremost among these is a proposal to establish a 
scholarship program for Iraqis to study in Poland.  Shialtagh 
said that he and the rector of Warsaw University, Piotr 
Weglenski, recently discussed creating 400 scholarships for 
Iraqi students.  Shialtagh hopes to establish the program 
this spring for possible enrollment by Iraqis this fall. He 
privately lamented, however, the lack of Polish funds for 
such a program and doubts that the Iraqi government can fund 
such a program. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Shialtagh said he is trying to bring Iraqi NGOs to 
Poland in order to observe the expected upcoming Polish 
elections in June.  Shialtagh believes that doing so would 
not only help the Iraqis better understand how a free and 
fair election is held, but it would also have a positive 
effect on Polish attitudes toward Iraq by showing Poles that 
they serve as an example for Iraq.  Such a program could also 
create opportunities for further cooperation between Polish 
and Iraqi NGOs.  Shialtagh suggested that USAID might fund 
such a program. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Shialtagh also commented that he would like to see 
the proposed international conference on the needs of the 
Iraqi disabled take place in Poland (reftel A).  The Iraqi 
public would warmly receive such a conference, and it would 
further illustrate to Iraqis the positive role that Poland 
has played in Iraq's reconstruction.  He has not yet heard 
any formal word from Poland concerning whether the GOP will 
host the conference. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment. Although Shialtagh's proposals could be 
effective in creating immediate positive public relations 
benefits for the Polish-Iraqi bilateral relationship, both 
the Iraqi embassy and the GOP seem short on funds, which will 
hinder the realization of his ideas.  End comment.
