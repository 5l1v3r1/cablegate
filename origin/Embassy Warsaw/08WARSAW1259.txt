CONSIDERING HOSTING EXERCISE PLANNING GROUP IN 2010

¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA) indicated that it might host Exercise Planning Group 
(EPG) activities of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism in 2010, but could not do so in 2009 due to 
internal staffing concerns.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Poloff delivered ref A demarche on October 29 to 
Szymon Bochenski, who is responsible for nuclear 
proliferation issues at the MFA's Security Policy Department. 
 According to Bochenski, the MFA was already considering 
whether it could host EPG activities in 2010 and will notify 
us when a decision is made.  Bochenski said the MFA was 
unable to host EPG activities next year because the Ministry 
was struggling with Global Initiative staffing requirements 
(ref B) and was organizing a European regional meeting under 
the auspices of the Proliferation Security Initiative in 
Spring 2009.  The MFA is also in the planning stages of 
organizing a seminar on non-proliferation issues in Fall 
2009, but Bochenski was reluctant to disclose details at this 
early stage. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Bochenski indicated that the MFA would not be able 
to participate in the EPG meeting in Virginia on November 
13-14 because the session conflicts with a NATO weapons of 
mass destruction (WMD) seminar in Berlin.  He noted, however, 
that the MFA staff found the Global Initiative web portal to 
be extremely useful, especially in tracking EPG developments. 
 Bochenski emphasized that he will host an inter-agency 
briefing within the next week to inform counterparts of the 
work of the Global Initiative. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On a related note, Bochenski told PolOff that Lukasz 
Zielinski, head of the MFA's WMD non-proliferation division, 
planned to participate in the Missile Technology Control 
Regime Plenary in Canberra in early November.  Zielinski will 
be accompanied by a Ministry of Defense (MOD) missile expert 
and a colonel from MOD's international security policy 
department.
