SUBJECT: DRAFT POLISH DEFENSE BUDGET, MORE FOR 
MODERNIZATION, LESS FOR FOREIGN MISSIONS 
 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: Poland's Parliamentary Defense Committee offered 
a glimpse of future defense spending when it approved the 
$5.6 billion draft defense budget for 2006 on December 15. 
This represents a 3.3% increase (adjusted for inflation) over 
¶2005.  Significant elements of the draft include $1 billion 
for modernizing the armed forces and a 24% drop in funding 
for military missions abroad in keeping with Polish plans to 
reduce troop numbers in Iraq from 1,450 to 900.  Deputy 
Defense Minister Stanislaw Koziej underscored that the draft 
defense budget for 2006 ensures development of the armed 
forces while maintaining international commitments.  Apart 
from the draft defense budget, Poland also plans to spend 
about $284 million on its F-16 program.  END SUMMARY.

Defense Spending Expected to Increase by 3.3%

¶3. The draft 2006 defense budget that the Defense Committee 
of the Sejm (lower chamber of Polish Parliament) approved on 
December 15, 2005 puts defense spending at PLN 18.064 billion 
($5.6 billion).  This constitutes 1.952% of the 2005 GDP (PLN 
925.4 billion or $ 286.5 billion) and thus meets the 
requirements of the Law on the Restructuring, Technical 
Modernization and Financing of the Polish Armed Forces. 
Defense spending in 2006 should exceed 2005 levels by 3.3% in 
real terms.  In 2006, the Ministry of Defense (MOD) 
anticipates increasing "property expenses," i.e. military 
equipment acquisition and development programs.  This 
"spending on technical modernization" will amount to over PLN 
3.6 billion ($1.1 billion) and constitute 20% of MOD's 2006 
budget.  Because of the planned increase in general defense 
spending and expenses on technical modernization, Deputy 
DefMin Koziej labeled the 2006 draft defense budget "pro 
development."

Draw Down in Iraq Means 24% Less for Foreign Missions

¶4. Deputy DefMin Koziej noted that Poland plans to reduce its 
presence in Iraq while preparing to assume command of the 
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan 
in 2007.  Poland projects its expenses for the Iraq mission 
to drop from PLN 217 million ($67.2 million) in 2005 to PLN 
131.5 million ($40.7 million) in 2006.  General Mieczyslaw 
Cieniuch, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, noted that 
projected expenses assumed no more than 900 Polish troops in 
Iraq in 2006.  Overall, the draft 2006 defense budget calls 
for spending PLN 233.6 million ($72.3 million) on foreign 
missions, a 24% decrease from 2005.

More Money for F-16s 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. In 2006, Poland expects to increase spending on its F-16 
program to PLN 916.1 million ($283.6 million).  These 
resources are not part of the defense budget, but will come 
from a state budget reserve that is designated for that 
program.  As Deputy DefMin Koziej explained to the Defense 
Committee, this reserve was originally planned at PLN 466 
million ($144.3 million) but had to be increased by PLN 450 
million to cover the Value Added Tax (VAT) on the first eight 
aircraft that Poland is scheduled to receive in 2006.  Koziej 
added that the government was working on an amendment to the 
Law on the Financing of the Multi-Role Aircraft Program that 
would increase expenses on that program by an amount equal to 
the sum of the VAT.

Defense Priorities and Foreign Obligations Satisfied 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶6. Deputy DefMin Koziej outlined this budget's 
accomplishments: 
 
-- meeting goals of the Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC), 
NATO response force (NRF) and EU forces, 
-- technical modernization of the armed forces with a focus 
on high readiness units, 
-- continued engagement of Polish troops in peacekeeping and 
crisis missions abroad, 
-- further professionalization of the armed forces and 
improvement of soldiers' welfare. 
 
Koziej added that this budget advances the modernization goal 
of having one-third of Poland's armed forces fully 
interoperable with NATO by 2008.  However, to add 
perspective, he noted that Polish defense spending per capita 
is 5 times lower than the NATO average and 3 times lower than 
the EU average.  Moreover, spending per soldier, again 
according to Koziej, is 3 times lower than NATO's average and 
2 times lower than the EU average. 
 
¶7. COMMENT: Poland's 2006 draft defense budget seems to 
exemplify the resource conflict between modernization and 
foreign missions often cited by MOD.  Accordingly, the 
current draft was presented as an effort to reconcile this 
tension by cutting costs in Iraq so as to prepare for future 
expenses in Afghanistan while slowly ramping up modernization 
efforts.  Investments in foreign missions may have some 
negative impact on the progress of modernization, but the 
experience of foreign missions may also advance the pace of 
modernization by forcing the Poles to focus on developing 
capabilities and acquiring material necessary to conduct 
actual operations.  Maintaining the current legacy force 
structure may be, after all, a greater hindrance to 
modernization than deployments abroad.  END COMMENT
