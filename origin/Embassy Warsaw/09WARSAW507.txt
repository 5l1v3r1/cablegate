(SBU)  On May 15, representatives from the British, French 
and German Embassies accompanied EconOff to deliver reftel 
demarche to Gregorz Szopinski, Kosovo desk officer at the 
Polish MFA.  Szopinski stated that Poland supports Kosovo, 
and understands the importance of returning a ballot to 
ensure quorum requirements are met, but noted that Poland is 
in a voting group with Serbia in the IMF and the World Bank. 
Consequently, the MFA already had sent a political opinion to 
the National Bank of Poland recommending that Poland send in 
a written abstention, as it did in the IMF balloting.  On May 
13, EconOff, accompanied by representatives from the French 
Embassy, delivered reftel demarche to Pawel Samecki and 
Romuald Szymczak at the National Bank of Poland (NBP).  Both 
reiterated their support for Kosovo, but stated that NBP 
President Slawomir Skrzypek will likely follow the MFA's 
recommendation and the Ministry of Finance's precedent in 
Poland's recent IMF vote, and submit a written abstention. 
Separately, World Bank President Zoellick is scheduled to 
meet with Skrzypek during his visit to Poland on Monday, May 
Â¶18.
