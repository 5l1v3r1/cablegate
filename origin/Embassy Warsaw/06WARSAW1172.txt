     Â¶B. WARSAW 877 
 
PolOff delivered reftel A demarche on June 13 to Jaroslaw 
Strejczek in the MFA's United Nations System and Global 
Affairs Department. Strejczek reiterated support for MDA and 
confirmed that Poland will vote in favor of the Third 
Additional Protocol, as reported in reftel B. Strejczek also 
said that the Polish government has an additional statement 
of support prepared, but has not yet decided whether it will 
be used at the June 20-21 Conference in Geneva. The Poles are 
waiting to see the text of the joint EU statement of support, 
which Strejczek was sure would be delivered, and after that 
will decide, along with several other EU countries, if they 
should make an additional statement of support for the 
compelling humanitarian need for the Third Additional 
Protocol.
