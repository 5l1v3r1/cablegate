-- Textiles and apparel together account for 3.61%

approximately 80% to the EU, exports to the U.S. are 
marginal 
 
Total textile and total apparel employment: 
-- textiles 56,000 employees; apparel 73,000 employees 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Krzysztof Zareba, expert on 
textile industry at the Department of Industry, 
Ministry of Economy, Polish producers are feeling great 
pressure due to increased competition from China. 
Poland is a member of the "southern countries" of the 
EU (including France, Greece, Spain, Portugal, 
and Italy) who support restrictions against China's 
exports of textiles and apparel, but is unlikely to implement 
any of its own restrictions.  Poland has not noted any 
closures of factories due to a company's desire to move 
production to Asia.  There have been some reductions in 
employment in the textile and apparel industry, but 
this is due to increased efficiency and automatization, 
thereby requiring less people to produce the same 
amount of goods.
