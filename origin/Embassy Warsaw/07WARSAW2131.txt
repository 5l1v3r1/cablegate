REF: SECSTATE 142626 
 
      ¶1. (SBU) On October 18, PolOff delivered reftel 
demarche to Krzysztof Ciebien, Minister Counselor for MFA,s 
Asia department. Ciebien stated 
      that in addition to Poland,s statement expressing 
concerns over the developments in Burma, the Government of 
Poland has raised the issue with 
      various representatives from the region. He noted, for 
example, that the MFA raised the issue with the Burmese 
Ambassador posted in Berlin, 
      who is accredited to Poland, when he was recently in 
Warsaw, and with the new Chinese Ambassador during his 
courtesy calls. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In the past month, Poland has provided 100,000 USD 
to assist Burmese refugees in Thailand via the Red Cross. 
Poland does not have any other bilateral aid programs in 
Burma. Ciebien reiterated Poland,s role in promoting 
democracy through the EU and noted that he just returned from 
Brussels, where EU members approved the revised sanctions on 
the regime, in areas such as timber and gems. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Cieben was eager to hear more about U.S. initiatives 
and plans in Burma, specifically on strategies of engagement 
with various groups and plans for democratic transition.  He 
also requested any additional information on the 
progress/success of U.S. assistance, such as the Global Human 
Rights Defenders Fund. Post will work with EAP/MLS to respond 
to this request.
