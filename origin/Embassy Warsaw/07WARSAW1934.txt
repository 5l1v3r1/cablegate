REF: STATE 119837 
 
¶1.  Econoff presented Reftel points on August 29 to Tadeusz 
Gorecki, assistant director of the Department of Maritime 
Transportation.  While noting that Poland shipped almost 
38,000 containers directly to the U.S. in the year ending 
April 30, Gorecki said he foresaw no problems with Poland's 
ablility to scan 100% of all U.S.-bound containers by 2012. 
 
¶2.  Gorecki added, however, that he has not discussed 
scanning with the management of Poland's ports.  He said 
further action was unlikely until after the Polish elections, 
scheduled for October 21.  He added he was not even sure at 
this point which ministry would be directing the operations 
of his department after the elections, speculating that it 
could be either Agriculture, Economy, or Infrastructure. 
 
¶3.  Commnent.  It does not appear that the Polish Ministry of 
Maritime Economy is going to consider seriously the cargo 
scanning requirement until after the late October elections 
and appointment of a new cabinet.  At that time, the GOP and 
Polish firms may join other groups in opposing the scanning 
requirement, as noted in Reftel.
