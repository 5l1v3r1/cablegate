SUBJECT: POLISH STATEMENT WELCOMES IRAQI DRAFT CONSTITUTION 
 
REF: A. WARSAW 3228 
 
     ¶B. STATE 158420 
 
¶1. (SBU) Following our approach (Ref B), the Polish MFA late 
August 29 released a public statement in support of Iraq's 
draft constitution.  Unofficial embassy translation of the 
original Polish-language text follows. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin text of Polish MFA statement. 
 
"Poland welcomes the completion of work on Iraq,s draft 
constitution.  The completion of this document should be 
recognized as an important achievement of the entire Iraqi 
nation and as evidence of the strengthening of democracy in 
that country.  Another important point on the calendar for 
the political process in Iraq has been carried out, in 
accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1546. 
Agreement on the draft constitution is testament to the will 
to reach agreement among the main political forces in that 
country, irrespective of the objections raised by the Sunni 
community. 
 
"We hope that the adoption of the constitution in a 
nation-wide referendum will be another step in the process of 
reconstructing Iraqi statehood and taking over responsibility 
for the state by the Iraqis themselves, who make sovereign 
decisions on their matters.  By taking a direct part in 
international efforts for the stabilization and 
reconstruction of Iraq, Poland will continue to support the 
Iraqi government and nation in their effort to build a 
democratic and united state.  We will also take actions to 
develop and strengthen ties and partnership cooperation 
between our two countries in all fields. Arrangements made 
during the last visit of the Polish Prime Minister to Iraq 
were an expression of this approach."
