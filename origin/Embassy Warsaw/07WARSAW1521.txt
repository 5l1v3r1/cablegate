REF: STATE 93173 
 
Classified By: Acting PolCouns David T. Morris for reasons 1.4(b) and ( 
d). 
 
(C) Post forwarded reftel request for ammunition to the 
Polish MOD and to the MFA Departments for Security Plicy and 
Middle East Africa.  However, according to DAO analysis 
Poland lacks the requested 155mm ammunition and holds only 
very limited quantities of the requested 105mm ammunition. 
We therefore do not expect Poland will be able to assist in 
this case.
