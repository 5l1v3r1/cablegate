Â¶1. (U) On December 7, PolOff delivered reftel points 
regarding the votes on country specific resolutions in the 
upcoming  UNGA Plenary to Mariusz Lewicki, Head of the Human 
Rights Section in the MFA,s UN Department. Mr. Lewicki 
assured us that Poland will attend the Plenary and reiterated 
Poland,s and the EU,s stance against no-action motions as 
well as their support for the country-specific resolutions. 
He did express some concern over the number of abstentions 
and said that Poland will lobby other capitals to help ensure 
that the four country-specific resolutions would be adopted 
in the UNGA Plenary.
