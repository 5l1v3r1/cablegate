(SBU) MFA Deputy Director for Security Policy Marek Szczyglo 
said Poland was interested in participating in reftel 
bioterrorism conference in Montreaux next month.  He was 
unsure whether he would be able to participate personally, 
but he will share the invitation information with MFA 
colleagues, as well as others in the GoP interagency 
community.  Szczyglo thought Poland would participate and 
hoped to have firmer information by next week.  He will 
contact the organizers directly with the GoP response.
