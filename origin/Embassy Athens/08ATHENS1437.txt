SUBJECT: GREECE/IRAN: GOG IMPLEMENTING 1835 AND IRISL 
MEASURES 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 105173 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 104496 
     ¶C. ATHENS 1347 
 
Classified By: A/POLCOUNS JEFFREY HOVENIER.  REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
¶1. (S) DepPolCouns and visiting EUR/SE Desk Officer Goodman 
discussed ref A and B demarches on UNSC 1835 and the 
designation of the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines 
(IRISL) with MFA A6 Directorate for Middle East Issues deputy 
head Giorgos Ayfantis.  Ayfantis stated categorically that 
Greece would take steps to implement UNSC 1835, but he 
provided no details on the specific measures.  DepEconCouns 
also delivered the demarches to Panagoitis Kyriakopoulos, 
Director for Bank Supervision, Bank of Greece. 
 
¶2. (S) As reported in ref C, FM Bakoyannis agreed to an 
advisory being issued on IRISL, and Deputy Minister for 
Mercantile Marine Kammenos told us that his Ministry had 
issued the advisory.  Subsequent to ref C, Kammenos provided 
us a copy of the advisory (in Greek). 
 
¶3. (S) COMMENT: While the GOG agreed to issue the IRISL 
advisory and to implement the 1835 measures, it is clear that 
the GOG remains wary of getting cross-wise with Greek 
shipowners, who do much business with Iran.  As Ayfantis 
explained to us once again, the shippers are savvy and 
cynical, with little regard for GOG warnings.  Given the 
tremendous political influence the shipowners wield in 
Greece, the GOG will tread lightly.  GOG officials find it 
easier, however, to take action against targeted individuals 
or companies when we provide them specific information.
