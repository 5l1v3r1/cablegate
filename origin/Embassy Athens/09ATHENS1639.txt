(SBU) Post delivered reftel message on opposition to one-sided UN 
General Assembly resolutions on November 18 to Greek MFA D1 
Directorate (UN and Internal Organizations) Second Counselor Loukas 
Tsokos and to MFA A6 Directorate (Arab Countries and Middle East) 
Counselor Stelios Gavriil.  Both expressed thanks for the 
information, acknowledging they were familiar with the U.S. 
position and noting that Greece would coordinate its votes within 
the EU.  Gavriil pointed to Greece's abstention on the November 5 
Goldstone report resolution as a "step forward" and an example of 
Greece pursuing a "balanced stance."  He explained that Greece 
decided to abstain, despite criticism from left-wing parties within 
Greece and the country's good relations with the Palestinians, 
because such resolutions had a "negative impact on the Israeli 
side" and hurt the prospects for the peace process.
