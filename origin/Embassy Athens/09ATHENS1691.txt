¶D. 12/24/09 EMAIL FROM TOM GRAMAGLIA; E. ATHENS 1585 
 
¶1. (SBU) In response to the GoG's request (see reftel E), 
DepEconCouns delivered to Ambassador Karafotias, the 
Director-General of Hellenic Aid, a list of USG-suggested projects 
in Afghanistan to which Greece may contribute funds (see reftel D). 
Per the GoG's previously expressed interest, the list included 
projects in the areas of preservation of cultural history, 
education, and health.  Ambassador Karafotias expressed his 
gratitude for the list and indicated he believes that Greece will 
be willing and able to fund one or more projects on the list.  He 
will try to make every effort to fund one of these projects by the 
end of this year.  Barring that, he will seek to announce this 
month the GoG's intent to fund projects on this list.  Karafotias 
indicated that by the end of the year, Greece already will have 
provided 4.85 million euro for projects in Afghanistan, mostly via 
contributions to allied donors with a presence on the ground.  He 
hopes to more than double this amount next year to 10 million euro. 
In order to send a signal of support for the Administration's new 
Afghanistan strategy, Karafotias said he will try to get the GoG to 
announce publicly and soon that Afghanistan will be Greece's top 
development assistance priority in 2010.  He also will try to 
ensure the public announcement links this prioritization with the 
new Afghan strategy. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) The following list is a breakdown of the 4.85 million euro 
Greek contribution to Afghanistan in 2009.  Contributions to the 
World Food Program (WFP), the UN election fund, and the Hungarian 
PRT have been made; the remaining contributions will be made by the 
end of 2009, according to Karafotias.  In most cases, specific 
projects are still under negotiation but likely will be in the 
areas of health and education, with a focus on women and children.
