¶1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  Looking ahead to Foreign Minister Bakoyannis' 
meeting in New York with the Secretary, Ambassador Speckhard 
reminded the FM that the earliest the U.S. could announce approval 
of the Visa Waiver Program for Greece would most likely be the end 
of October 2009, encouraged Greek goodwill toward Turkey in the 
Aegean, and urged the Minister to make a strong statement on Iran 
at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly during a September 
16 meeting.  FM Bakoyannis lamented that despite her personal hard 
work and political risk-taking with Parliament to ram through VWP 
legislation in the face of criticism from the opposition, the U.S. 
would be handing a major prize to the opposition, should it prove 
victorious (as polls predict).  She urged that a future date for 
implementation be agreed and announced at her meeting with the 
Secretary.    She laid down a marker that Turkey must cease 
overflights of inhabited Greek islands in the Aegean before Greece 
will consider Turkish actions there in any way other than hostile. 
On Iran, she noted the importance of bringing Russia and China on 
board in any international approach.  Ambassador Speckhard also 
reviewed OSCE issues and the election of a new UNESCO DG with the 
Minister.  END SUMMARY.

¶2.  (C)  FM Bakoyannis made a strong pitch to the Ambassador for 
the United States to announce at her meeting with the Secretary at 
UNGA a future date for VWP implementation,  asking for the 
Secretary's involvement within the USG to prioritize and energize 
interagency work to make it happen.  The Minister bemoaned the fact 
that she personally had worked hard with the United States and fast 
tracked controversial implementing legislation - such as that 
dealing with data sharing - through the Greek Parliament, only now 
to see a scenario unfolding whereby her party could lose, and the 
opposition would be handed a major gift within weeks of taking 
office.  Most ironic, she noted, was that the socialist PASOK 
parliamentarians who had taken her to task for fast-tracking VWP 
legislation and the MLAT now stood to reap the political benefits. 
The Ambassador noted that announcing the Greek entry into VWP was 
most likely not possible until the end of October at the earliest, 
but promised to pass her message to the Secretary.  (Comment: all 
polls in Greece point to PASOK defeating the Foreign Minister's New 
Democracy party on October 4.  In Greece's conspiracy prone 
environment, pundits will likely perceive an announcement on VWP 
weeks after the election to be confirmation of a widely held view 
that the U.S. did not like Karamanlis for his frequent courting of 
the Russians.  Similarly, an announcement with Minister Bakoyannis 
at UNGA would be taken as a signal of personal support for her, who 
is a candidate for future leadership in her party and is seen as a 
pro-U.S. in the Greek political system.)

Turkey:  FM - Stopping Overflights Key; Damage Already Done to EU

¶3.  (C)  Ambassador Speckhard drew on familiar themes in 
 
ATHENS 00001483  002 OF 003 
 
 
reiterating U.S. concern over tensions in the Aegean between Greece 
and Turkey.  He urged FM Bakoyannis not to let Greece be the 
country slowing up any positive developments in the Aegean, to show 
goodwill, and to be prepared to act on any goodwill shown by 
Turkey.  Ceasing to label Turkish aircraft entering the Aegean as 
"hostile" and stopping intercepts of Turkish aircraft in the Flight 
Information Region would be strong and positive signs, he stated. 
He also asked the Minister for Greek views on a Turkish-drafted 
"Code of Conduct" for the Aegean that was recently passed to 
Greece, as well as five confidence-building measures (CBMs) 
reported on in reftel A. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (C)  Bakoyannis dismissed the Turks' proposed Code of Conduct, 
stating that in practice, it only serves to call into question the 
sovereignty of Greek territory, and on that basis serves to make 
the situation worse.  They saw the Code as an attempt to recycle 
Turkish proposals for Greek actions that had already been rejected 
in the CBM discussions and putting a new wrapper on them.  "I don't 
have the feeling the Turks want to do more," she added, noting that 
while she hears much rhetoric, she sees no movement.  As long as 
overflights of inhabited Greek islands in the Aegean continue, she 
stressed, the only way Turkey's Aegean policy can be interpreted is 
hostile.  She cited Turkish overflights on religious holidays 
despite past understandings not to, and an overflight "two days 
ago" as examples. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (C)  Looking at upcoming steps in the Turkish EU accession 
process, FM Bakoyannis shared her view that Turkey believed it 
could pressure Greece "right up until December."  However, 
regardless of who wins the October 4 elections in Greece, she 
speculated that any Greek government now will have a tough time 
supporting Turkey in December based on Turkish behavior over the 
past year in the Aegean that has been incongruent with EU 
aspirations.  On that note she also commented on the recent 
incident in the Aegean with a helicopter flying a mission in Greek 
airspace for the EU's Frontex border monitoring operation aimed at 
countering illegal immigration.  She has pictures, she asserted, 
from the helicopter of a boat full of illegal immigrants being 
followed by a Turkish military ship.   She stated that this is 
another incident of Turkey pushing immigrants toward Greece, rather 
than stopping them at the source.  The Ambassador demurred on those 
allegations, and reinforced the need for both Turkey and Greece to 
tackle Aegean issues in a constructive manner.

¶6.  (C)  The Ambassador encouraged Greece to play a strong role 
within the international community to encourage Iran to make the 
right choices regarding its nuclear program.  Looking toward the 
FM's travel to UNGA, where she will meet the Secretary, he urged a 
strong stance on Iran in the FM's public statements, and in her 
meetings with other officials.  Iran must avoid confrontation by 
accepting a diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue and fulfilling 
its international responsibilities, he stressed.  Bakoyannis said 
she had recently gone to Brussels to participate in an EU foreign 
ministers meeting (Comment: the monthly GAERC meeting) to 
participate in the discussion on Iran, and that Greece supported 
the EU's common position.  She stated that international efforts 
will be hard-pressed for success, though, absent Russian and

Chinese agreement.

OSCE Encouragement, UNESCO Disappointment

¶7.  (C)  Looking ahead to the OSCE Ministerial in December, the FM 
was optimistic at achieving a consensus-based communique agreed by 
all 56 members, but admitted the "devil is in the details."  The 
Ambassador encouraged the FM to open a "Chairman's Office" in 
Tbilisi, which the Greeks had intended to do following the Russian 
refusal in Vienna to renew the mandate of the OSCE monitoring 
mission in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, but which they backed off of 
following Russian threats to boycott the September 17 Geneva 
discussions on the Caucasus.  Bakoyannis expressed reservations in 
doing anything that would aggravate the situation and was looking 
forward to hearing Secretary Clinton's views on this during their 
meeting in New York. 
 
 
 
¶8.  (C)  Ambassador Speckhard urged Greece not to vote for the 
Egyptian candidate for UNESCO Director General on September 17.  He 
highlighted that the U.S. could support other candidates from 
Austria, Bulgaria, Ecuador, Lithuania and Tanzania, but had serious 
reservations about the suitability of the Egyptian candidate. 
Bakoyannis noted the Greeks were in a bind, particularly now that 
there was an EU candidate, because both she and the Prime Minister 
had in the past promised the Greek vote to the Egyptian.
