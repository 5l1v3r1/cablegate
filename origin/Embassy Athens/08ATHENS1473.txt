SUBJECT: GREECE: IRAN'S UPCOMING NUCLEAR CONFERENCE 
DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 112229 
 
Â¶1. (U)  On October 23, DepPolCouns and Poloff delivered 
reftel demarche on the upcoming nuclear conference in Iran to 
Ambassador Tryphon Paraskevopoulos, Director of the MFA D1 
Department United Nations and International Organizations 
Affairs, and Loukas Tsokos, D1 First Secretary.  Tsokos said 
D1 had not heard of the conference nor received an 
invitation.  He added that he checked with the MFA A6 
Directorate for Arab Countries and the Middle East and they 
had the same response.  We pushed them not to participate in 
the conference as it would legitimize Iran's claims that its 
nuclear activities were exclusively peaceful.  Tsokos 
responded there was no prospect of a Greek delegation 
attending the conference but added it was possible the Greek 
Ambassador in Tehran could attend for "informational" 
purposes.  He said he would conduct further inquiries with 
the Greek Ministry of Development and Economy and would 
notify us if he received more information or an invitation 
from Iran.
