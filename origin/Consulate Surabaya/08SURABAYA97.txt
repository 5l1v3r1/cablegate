¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The opening of a Surabaya DNA forensics lab 
established with assistance from the U.S. Department of 
Justice's International Criminal Investigative Training 
Assistance Program (ICITAP) generated positive press in East 
Java and the continued appreciation of provincial police.  The 
press coverage focused on the role of U.S. assistance and ICITAP 
advisors and noted that the lab will play an important role in 
future investigations cases, including investigations into the 
recent serial killings in Jombang, East Java.  The DNA lab 
serves as a catalyst for the transition from the previous 
confession-based system to an evidence-based system of criminal 
investigation, the trademark of a professional law enforcement 
agency.  The opening of this DNA lab is latest example of 
positive U.S.-Indonesian cooperation through an ICITAP program 
to strengthen the professionalism and effectiveness of the 
Indonesian National Police.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Senior police officials from throughout Eastern 
Indonesia gathered at the East Java provincial police 
headquarters for the opening of the ICITAP funded DNA forensics 
lab on August 6.  Cooperation between the East Java Regional 
Police and ICITAP, a Department of Justice program that offers 
training and infrastructure to foreign police forces, began in 
July 2003 and has included investigative training for police 
officers and NGOs and the opening of a cyber crimes lab.  Local 
press highlighted the benefits of the East Java Regional Police 
Department's new DNA-testing equipment, providing only the 
second with DNA-testing capacity in the country and handling 
cases from East Java and Kalimantan.  Previously, DNA samples 
from around the country had to be sent to the National Police 
Headquarters in Jakarta.  Most media reported plans for a DNA 
data bank containing DNA samples from convicted criminals that 
will be used to make policework easier. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The press pointed to an on-going serial murder 
investigation to illustrate the benefit of the lab.  Feri Idham 
Henyansah is suspected of killing at least 11 in Jombang and has 
been the center of media attention throughout East Java.  The 
local press noted that the DNA tests could have been conducted 
at the new East Java Forensics Lab, but because the equipment 
had not been officially inaugurated, the initial tests had been 
done in Jakarta.  All press reports mentioned the crime as an 
example of a situation in which DNA testing is necessary, 
thereby making the lab more relevant to the public.  East Java's 
leading newspaper, Jawa Pos,  quoted the Chief of Police for 
East Java, Herman S. Sumawiredja, praising the equipment's value 
to criminal investigation and emphasizing the need to upgrade 
forensic technology at a time when criminals are sophisticated 
and no longer leave obvious tracks.  Other papers added that 
Herman issued thanks to the United States for the gift as it 
would be helpful to the Indonesian government. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The United States and ICITAP received unanimously 
positive press coverage from the event.  The opening ceremony 
was open to the press and featured remarks by Pak Herman, the 
lab's senior officials, Surabaya PO and ICITAP advisors.  The 
Memorandum referred to cooperation between the East Java 
Regional Police Department and ICITAP.  Most press referred to 
the equipment as aid from the United States government.  Several 
online media sources also quoted ICITAP senior consultant David 
¶N. Gidley as saying the equipment met internationals standard 
and was meant to reinforce an evidence-based crime fighting 
system.  Suara Surabaya online also noted that the United States 
had not only donated the equipment but provided training, adding 
up to a total contribution of approximately US$ 700,000.
