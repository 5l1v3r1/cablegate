SUBJECT: MANADO'S TRADITIONAL FISHERMEN AND FISH STOCKS FACE NUMEROUS 
THREATS 
 
REF: SURABAYA 111 (FISHERY LAW THREATENS MALUKU TRADITIONS) 
 
¶1. Representatives from the local NGO KELOLA and the North 
Sulawesi Traditional Fisherman Association (ANTRA) are trying to 
raise awareness about threats to the livelihood of traditional 
fishermen in North Sulawesi.  Local fishermen established ANTRA, 
with a current membership of 1500, earlier this year to 
facilitate a coordinated response to threats from overfishing, 
development, pollution, and industry. 
 
¶2. The most disturbing threat to traditional fishermen and their 
livelihood is the decrease in the overall totals of fish caught. 
 The size of the fish caught has also dramatically decreased in 
the last five years.  Traditional fishermen blame pollution, 
overfishing by commercial fishermen, and illegal fishing for the 
decrease in the number of total fish.  The figure for 2008 was 
around 139,000 tons of fish caught, down nearly 50% from the 
2007 total of 272,000 tons of fish caught.  Garbage from the 
city of Manado and pollution are also factors in the decrease in 
fish size of fish, as the fish are not as healthy as before. 
 
¶3. In the city of Manado, fisherman are concerned about access 
to coastal areas after the local government built new shopping 
and office centers along the coast.  They claim the developer of 
these commercial centers did not fulfill a promise to build 
docking areas along the development's edge for local fisherman. 
Similarly, in North Minahasa, traditional fisherman lost their 
access to fishing grounds due to the developing sand mining 
industry.  Local fishermen lose all dock access whenever sand 
mining activities occur. 
 
¶4. While Bunaken National Park brings significant tourist 
dollars and prestige to North Sulawesi, local fishermen complain 
that Bunaken's "fish catching zones," which are regulated by the 
National Park Administrator, limits their livelihood. 
Traditional fishermen, who usually have limited schooling, lack 
education about the rules and are often charged with crimes for 
violating the Park's regulations.  ANTRA members want more 
education and explanations about the regulations and rules which 
apply to traditional fisherman. 
 
¶5. More distant islands feel increasing pressure from large 
commercial fishing vessels operating in Indonesian waters. 
Antara complain that illegal fishing by Philippine, South 
Korean, and Thai commercial fishing vessels are severely harming 
the traditional fishing industry.  In addition to the mounting 
external pressures facing the traditional fisherman, the 
remoteness of the islands, with limited access to markets, fuel, 
and supplies, continues to undermine the commercial viability of 
traditional fishing methods.  The remote location also affects 
the ability of Indonesian Navy and police to properly patrol the 
waters in this area.
