¶1. (SBU) Summary: The head of a local NGO in Manado described 
the growing problem of HIV and trafficking in women during 
Surabaya Principal Officer's recent visit.  In a city that 
prides itself on beginning strongly Christian, prostitution has 
been forced further underground, making monitoring the incidence 
of HIV difficult.  Trafficking volume has increased in recent 
months for reasons that remain unclear.  Local officials, 
however, turn a blind eye to the problem, despite sufficient 
anti-trafficking legislation.  End Summary. 
 
HIV 
---- 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a September 25-27 trip to Manado, North 
Sulawesi, Surabaya Principal Officer met with Dr. Jane 
Pangemanan, Director of "Sahabat Perempuan," a local NGO 
dedicated to improving the health of women and children in the 
province.  Established in 1999 by women activists in Manado to 
mitigate the increasing incidence of HIV/AIDS in the region, 
Sahabat Perempuan has since expanded its activities to include 
combating trafficking in persons.  According to Dr. Pangemanan, 
there are at least known 1,890 HIV cases in North Sulawesi, but 
the provincial government has little interest in the issue. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Unlike other urban areas, where prostitutes ply their 
trade in concentrated areas of town, Manado prostitutes are 
working in individual areas scattered throughout the area.  Dr. 
Pangemanan explained that local officials want to promote 
Manado's reputation as a religious, Christian city.  Obvious 
prostitution would undermine that image.  As a result of local 
government regulation and enforcement, prostitution is forced 
further underground, making it more difficult for NGOs to 
monitor the spread of HIV and provide education about the 
dangers. 
 
GROWING TIP PROBLEM 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to Dr. Pangemanan, the volume of trafficking 
has increased dramatically since January.  Previously, every 
month, two girls from North Sulawesi were trafficked to Papua, 
Jakarta, Batam (then to Singapore), Kalimantan, Malaysia and 
Japan; now it is more like two girls per week.  According to 
Sahabat Perempuan's data, between January and September 2007, 80 
girls had been trafficked.  Dr. Pangemanan offered no specific 
insights into why the volume of trafficking was increasing, 
other than to note that Manado girls were considered very 
desirable in other parts of Southeast Asia.  She added that 
while economic growth continued, the number of poor was also 
increasing. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Dr. Pangemanan explained that North Sulawesi has strong 
anti-trafficking laws, but enforcement is non-existent because 
local MPs and the Governor are only interested in issues that 
earn money.   She criticized the current governor for ignoring 
the problems of HIV and trafficking, commenting that he spent 
too much time preparing for Manado to host a World Oceans 
Conference in 2009 to worry about local issues.  The previous 
governor and his wife, she said, had been serious in their 
approach to these issues.
