SUBJECT: EAST JAVA MUD FLOW UPDATE: SUBSIDENCE CAUSING DAM BREACHES 
 
REF: SURBAYA 56 
 
¶1.  Two earthen dams separating lagoons of mud have been 
breached at the Lapindo Mud Flow site according to local press 
reports.  Near midnight on Sunday 21 October, Dam 25 collapsed 
and underwent two quick repairs.  Mud from the breach flowed 
from one holding pond into another at the former site of 
Jatirejo village.  While this breach did not flow outside the 
current containment, recent multiple failures of dams there 
suggest a continuing problem with dam stability and no single 
definitive cause, according to sources at the site. 
 
¶2.  Sidoarjo Mud Disaster Management Board spokesman Achmad 
Zulkarnain told the Jawa Pos that serious subsidence beneath 
Dams 24 and 25 started on 21 October causing mud to flow rapidly 
out of a crack 40cm wide and five meters long. The Sidoarjo Mud 
Management Agency (BPLS) started emergency repairs in the early 
morning hours of Monday 22 October, but the repairs failed.  The 
dam collapsed again at 5:30 AM and the mud poured uncontrollably 
through the crack into the adjacent Jatirejo pond.  The outer 
wall of this pond is immediately adjacent to the railway and the 
main road linking the far east of Java to the rest of the island. 
 
¶3.  BPLS spokesman Achmad Zulkarnain said subsidence is also 
causing cracking beneath Dams 42, 43 and 47. He speculated that 
the ruptures might be exacerbated by earthquakes related to the 
anticipated eruption of the Mount Kelud volcano 90 kms to the 
south.  However Consulate Surabaya's discussion with BPLS 
personnel suggests that lack of personnel during the recent 
Lebaran holiday likely led to a decline in dam maintenance and 
ability to repair breaches at the site (reftel).  Zulkarnain 
told the media that BPLS cannot guarantee the safety of the dams 
because their strength depends on geological conditions.  In 
order to anticipate and counteract the leaks, BPLS can only 
build surrounding secondary "counter-wide" dams around the 
breaches. 
 
¶4.  Mr. Handoko Teguh, the head of mud flow mitigation working 
group of BPLS, told Consulate General Surabaya today that a new 
dam system entirely enclosing the village of Renokenogo is being 
constructed adjacent to the breach at Dam 42.  This breach 
caused the inundation and evacuation of the village (reftel). 
The dam will form a new outer retaining wall for the mud flow to 
the north of the site.  Although some residents of the village 
refuse to move from their homes, construction of the dam 
continues apace and has already reached a height of 4 meters and 
a length of 100 meters.
