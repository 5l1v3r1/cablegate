¶1. (SBU) Summary: ConGen Surabaya celebrated Earth Day by 
joining a clean-the-beach campaign organized by a local NGO and 
planting trees in a nearby park.  Later in the week, the 
Principal Officer participated in a well-attended seminar 
organized by a group of women's issues activists to discuss the 
importance of environmental awareness and the role of women in 
local communities to protect the environment.  The activists 
linked Earth Day celebrations with Kartini Day, which 
commemorates Indonesian women's emancipation, to highlight the 
impact of environmental degradation on women and children.  The 
activists organized a well-publicized meeting with women 
displaced by the Sidoarjo mudflow to illustrate their concerns. 
End Summary. 
 
Clean the Beach: Plant Trees 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) In celebration of Earth Day, members of the Consulate 
community joined a clean-the-beach event organized by local NGOs 
and sponsored by local government leaders on April 20.  Members 
of the Consulate, local politicians, several NGOs, and school 
children picked up and removed trash from a beach located in 
North Surabaya, about 45 minutes from the city center. 
According to the organizers, 2,400 students from 50 schools 
participated in the event.   Surabaya's Public Affairs Officer 
and the Head of Surabaya's Tourism Office gave remarks from a 
pier about the significance of Earth Day and environmental 
awareness.  The group then proceeded to a local park where they 
planted 80 trees, 20 of which were donated by the Consul 
General.  The event received wide-spread positive media coverage. 
 
Women and the Environment 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) On April 25, the Principal Officer participated in 
activities organized by the Forum Perempuan Peduli (FPP -- Women 
Who Care), a group of women's issues activists, NGO leaders, and 
political leaders who coordinate their individual efforts to 
address common concerns.  FPP, which originated at a regular 
lunch gathering hosted by the Consulate, first organized around 
the issue of domestic violence (reftel).  FPP linked Earth Day 
celebrations with Kartini Day (April 21), which honors a 
nineteenth century Javanese woman who advocated women's 
empancipation.  More than 300 women activists from Surabaya and 
the regency of Sidoarjo gathered together to discuss increasing 
environmental awareness, the impact of environmental disasters 
on communities, and strategies for protecting the environment. 
The participants also watched the movie "An Inconvenient Truth." 
 
¶4. (SBU) As part of the day-long event, the wife of the Sidoarjo 
regent arranged a visit to a tent camp for families displaced by 
the Sidaorjo mudflow.  The activists hoped extensive media 
coverage of the visit would highlight the impact of 
environmental degradation on women and children and spur the 
central government to action.  More than 1,000 people from 272 
families have been living in this camp located on the abandoned 
toll road since their homes were engulfed by mud almost three 
months ago.  The central government has yet to disburse 
compensation funds from the national budget as promised.  The 
visit and the seminar generated substantial positive media 
coverage.
