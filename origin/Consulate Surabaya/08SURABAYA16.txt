¶1. (SBU) According to police and media contacts, early Saturday 
morning, February 2, a group of Indonesian armed forces (TNI) 
soldiers from the 731 Kabaresi infantry battalion in Central 
Maluku attacked local police offices in the city of Masohi on 
the island of Seram.  After an exchange of gunfire that lasted 
six hours, two policemen and one soldier were dead and three 
policemen injured.  The soldiers reportedly used combat rifles 
and grenades, burned nine police barracks, and destroyed the 
official residence of the Police Chief of Central Maluku. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to the Pattimura Military Commander, the 
incident was triggered by a misunderstanding.  Reportedly, after 
a dispute with his girlfriend, a TNI soldier from the 731 
Kabaresi infantry battalion failed to return to his barracks. 
After rumors circulated that he was being detained by police, 
his colleagues decided to attack the local police station to 
secure his release.  No civilians were involved in the clash. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Maluku Governor Karel Albert Ralahalu, the Pattimura 
Military Commander, and the Maluku Provincial Chief of Police 
(Kapolda) traveled to Masohi to take control of the situation. 
On February 4, TNI soldiers and police officers met in a tearful 
reconciliation ceremony at a sports stadium in Central Maluku. 
The Military Commander expressed his apologies to the Kapolda 
and pledged to help rebuild the burnt residences and other 
facilities.  As of February 5, all contacts tell us that the 
situation is Masohi city is "back to normal."
