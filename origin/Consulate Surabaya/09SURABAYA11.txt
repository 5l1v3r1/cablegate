¶1. (SBU) Summary: For the first time since 2002, a U.S. Naval 
ship paid a visit to the resort island of Bali, spotlighting 
Indonesia's much improved security situation and deepening 
U.S.-Indonesia security and counterterrorism cooperation.  The 
visit by USS LASSEN and its crew is the latest example of 
enhanced ties between the U.S. and Indonesian militaries, which 
share common interests in improving security.  Vice Admiral John 
¶M. Bird, Commander of the Seventh Fleet, expressed his hope to 
Bali's governor and senior military officials that the LASSEN's 
visit would be the first of many such ship visits in the coming 
months.  In both Bali and Surabaya, Mrs. Bird toured local 
schools, answered questions and provided educational materials. 
Local press reports were universally positive.  End Summary. 
 
 ¶2. (SBU) The January 31 to February 3 visit by the USS LASSEN, 
a guided missile destroyer, to Bali was the first such visit 
since the 2002 Bali bombings.  The three-day visit spotlighted 
improved security conditions and deepening U.S.-Indonesian 
cooperation on security and counterterrorism.  In a meeting with 
Vice Admiral Bird and Ambassador Hume, Bali's Governor I Made 
Mangku Pasitika emphasized the significance of the USS LASSEN's 
visit to demonstrating the enhanced security standards in Bali. 
Vice Admiral Moehklas Sidik, Indonesia's Deputy Chief of Naval 
Staff hosted a dinner honoring Admiral Bird and the crew of the 
USS LASSEN, attended by senior Balinese and Indonesian civilian, 
military, and security officials. 
 
¶3. (SBU) During the visit, the 300 member crew of the USS LASSEN 
participated in sporting competitions against their Indonesian 
counterparts.  The ship departed on February 3 without incident. 
 Local and national press reports of the ship visit were 
universally positive highlighting the intention of the crew to 
experience first-hand Bali's unique culture and hospitality. 
Vice Admiral Bird expressed the hope that the USS LASSEN's visit 
would be the first of many similar visits to Bali in the coming 
months. 
 
Educational Outreach 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) During his visit to Surabaya, Vice Admiral Bird gave a 
presentation at the Indonesian Naval Academy to an attentive 
audience of approximately 300 naval and marine cadets and 
faculty.  Admiral Bird's presentation on the U.S. Seventh Fleet 
stimulated questions on the future of U.S.-Indonesian military 
relations under an Obama Administration and life in the U.S. 
Navy. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Mrs. Bird visited an Indonesian naval-affiliated high 
school during Admiral Bird's visit to Surabaya.  She presented a 
large hardbound book on the history of the U.S. Navy to the 
school and she fielded questions from students and faculty.  The 
Consulate also provided the school with information on State 
Department education and cultural programs.  During the USS 
LASSEN's visit to Bali, the Consulate arranged for Mrs. Bird to 
visit a local NGO's alternative school, which offers educational 
opportunities to children from poor families who cannot afford 
to attend public school in Indonesia.  Mrs. Bird presented 
nearly $500 worth of school supplies, toys, and games to the 
Street Kids Ministry, which gives street children the chance to 
learn in a classroom environment from volunteer teachers.  Mrs. 
Bird also helped pass out some snacks and treats to poor 
children in the neighborhood.  The event was widely covered by 
media in Bali and appeared in some national newspapers as well.
