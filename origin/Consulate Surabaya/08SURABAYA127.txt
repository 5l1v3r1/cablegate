¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Indonesia's official news agency reported 
that there were no injuries from "low-magnitude explosions" at 
three locations in North Maluku's provincial capital Ternate 
early in the morning of November 3.  The blasts hit the North 
Maluku Governor's residence, the North Maluku regional 
government Office and the North Maluku Regional Legislative 
Assembly (DPRD).  Given the targets of the blasts and a 
demonstration against the incumbent governor only hours later, 
the bombings are likely the work of supporters of the defeated 
governor's candidate.  Hundreds of supporters of Abdul Gafur and 
his running mate Fabanyo later clashed with police when they 
tried to storm the offices of North Maluku's Governor. 
Demonstrators demanded President Yudhoyono rescind his decree 
installing Thaib Armayn and Vice Governor Abdul Gani Kasuba. 
End Summary 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Local press reported that the first explosion damaged 
one side of North Maluku Governor Thaib Armaiyn's official 
residence.  Five minutes later, a second explosion destroyed the 
ceiling of the Financial Bureau of the North Maluku Governor's 
Office.  The third blast hit the Provincial Parliament (DPRD) 
building, shattering glass windows in the guard post outside. 
There were no reports of injuries. Two Congen Surabaya contacts 
in Ternate confirmed the location and timing of the blasts and 
estimated that the bombs could be heard over 3 kilometers away. 
North Maluku police have cordoned off the sites of the 
explosions and closed the road near Governor's residence.  North 
Maluku's Police Chief Brig. Gen. Mustafa told local press that 
his officers found a fourth bomb at the Governor's residence 
that failed to detonate.  Bomb Squad Unit Chief Asst. Inspector 
Adi Sangaji confirmed to Congen Surabaya the general impression 
that the bombs are unrelated to the anticipated execution of the 
Bali bombers.  Inspector Sangaji reiterated that the bombs were 
likely set by people dissatisfied over the national government's 
installation of the current Governor. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Demonstrations against the installation of the current 
governor erupted again in Ternate at 11:00 AM local time, just 
seven hours after the explosions.  The situation in North Maluku 
remains tense, as supporters burned the party flag of President 
Yudhoyono's party, Partai Demokrat, and threatened to continue 
demonstrations throughout the day.  This is the latest violence 
in nearly a year of strife over the disputed outcome of the 
November 2007 governor's election (Ref A).  Incumbents Thaib 
Armayn and Abdul Gani Kasuba were officially installed as 
Governor and Vice Governor on September 29, 2008.  Minister of 
Home Affairs Mardiyanto reinstalled the incumbents nearly a year 
after a contentious election marred by sporadic violent 
protests.  Only 14 of 35 local members of parliament attended 
the inauguration and supporters of the defeated candidates Abdul 
Gafur and Abdurahim Fabanyo quickly took to the streets again in 
protest.
