SUBJECT: SANMEN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT - OFFICIALS MARK THE START OF 
CONSTRUCTION 
 
¶1.  On April 19, the National Development and Reform Commission 
- National Energy Administration (NEA), China National Nuclear 
Corporation (CNNC), State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation 
(SNPTC), and the Sanmen Nuclear Power Company hosted a 
construction commencement ceremony for the Sanmen Nuclear Power 
plant in Sanmen, Zhejiang Province, China.  This ceremony marked 
the beginning of phase one of the nuclear power plant 
construction.  Known as the Sanmen Nuclear Power Self-reliance 
and Supporting Program, the Sanmen project is a collaboration 
between Chinese and foreign firms to build a nuclear plant using 
Westinghouse AP1000 technology.  The AP1000 reactor is the first 
3rd generation reactor to be built in China. 
 
¶2.  Over 1,000 project-related workers and 400 VIP guests 
attended, including Vice Premier LI Keqiang, NEA Administrator 
ZHANG Guobao, Ministry of Environmental Protection Vice Minister 
LI Ganjie, Zhejiang Provincial Governor LU Zushang, CNNC General 
Manager KANG Rixin, the Chairman of SNTPC and others.  Bill 
Borchardt, Executive Director for Operations, Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC), Cindy Rosales-Cooper, Assistant for 
Administration and Finance, NRC as well as Embassy and Congen 
Shanghai staff (Department of Energy (DOE) and Environment, 
Science, Technology, and Health (ESTH) Sections) represented the 
United States. 
 
¶3.  Chinese officials praised the Central Government for its 
support of the project, calling it a milestone in China's 
nuclear power development history.  In his remarks, Vice Premier 
Li underscored the need to develop new energy such as nuclear to 
ensure the country's energy security and to boost economic 
growth.  He said China needs to adjust its energy structure to 
diversify its energy sources and enhance conservation and 
emission control.  Zhang Guobao said that this project is the 
biggest cooperation project between the United States and China 
and highlights the two country's efforts in the peaceful use of 
nuclear power.  China made the right decision in choosing the 
Westinghouse AP1000 reactor because it is the safest technology 
of its kind that will optimize China's energy structure and 
protect the environment, said Zhang. 
 
¶4.  The Sanmen Nuclear Power Plant will be built in three 
phases, with an investment of more than CNY 40 billion (USD 5.88 
billion) injected in the first phase.  The first phase project 
will include two units each with a generating capacity of 1.25 
million kilowatts.  The first generating unit will be put into 
operation in 2013, and the second, in 2014. The plant will 
eventually have six such units. 
 
¶5.  This report has been coordinated with Embassy Beijing DOE 
and ESTH sections.
