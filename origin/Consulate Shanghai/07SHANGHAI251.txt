¶1. (SBU) Summary: In an April 19 meeting with Embassy Econ M/C, 
China Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX) Deputy General Manager 
Hu Zheng and CFFEX Head of R&D Zhang Xiaogang provided a 
briefing on the status of CFFEX, obstacles it had overcome to 
date, and prospects for becoming operational.  Since its 
September 8 inauguration, CFFEX focused on: developing a 
regulatory structure; establishing and testing operational 
systems; and preparing the market and determining criteria for 
membership.  While the regulatory framework was falling into 
place and CFFEX itself was comfortable with its operating 
systems, potential member firms were waiting for more certainty 
about membership criteria and a launch date before investing in 
technology to connect with the CFFEX system.  CFFEX's first 
product, likely at least another two months off, would be a 
stock index future.  Hu also suggested CFFEX was better suited 
for cooperation with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) than 
the China Foreign Exchange Trading System.  End Summary.

Open, But Not For Business

¶2. (SBU) Hu said that CFFEX was inaugurated on September 8, 2006 
with registered capital of 500 million yuan (about USD 62.5 
million), with the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges and the 
Shanghai, Dalian, and Zhengzhou Futures Exchanges each owning 20 
percent.  Zhu Yuchen, aka Eugene Zhu, former head of the Dalian 
Commodity Exchange and Chairman of China Futures Association had 
been appointed President of CFFEX by the China Security 
Regulatory Commission (CSRC).  Hu himself was formerly Deputy 
General Manager of the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE).

Laying the Groundwork 
--------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Since its September 8 inauguration, CFFEX focused on 
laying the groundwork, including: developing a regulatory 
structure; establishing and testing operational systems; and 
preparing the market and determining criteria for membership. 
The regulations on futures trading, issued by the State Council 
on March 16 and taking effect on April 15, provided the legal 
foundation for the introduction of financial derivatives and 
would be followed by seven sets of more detailed operating 
regulations to be issued over the next month or two.  (Note: 
CSRS released three of these regulations on April 22 -- ,
