¶1.  (SBU) The Ninth Shanghai Party Congress opened on May 24 at 
the Shanghai Exhibition Center; the meeting will run through May 
¶28. In addition to the 810 delegates elected at the previous 
day's preparatory session, representatives from China's minority 
parties, a delegation from the Organization Department of the 
Central Committee in Beijing; and representatives from the local 
People's Congress and Political Consultative Congress attended 
the meeting.  Furthermore, the diplomatic community was invited 
to observe, with each Consulate allowed to send a single 
observer.  The report was delivered, however, entirely in 
Chinese without any interpretation.  There were also some 
representatives of foreign press organizations resident in 
Shanghai in attendance.  Although delegates had a written text 
to follow, this was not made available to foreign observers. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) After a brief introduction by Mayor Han Zheng, newly 
appointed Party Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a two-hour work 
report.  Xi read in a clear, relaxed manner; although he mopped 
his brow several times in the course of the speech, in general 
he seemed entirely at ease in this somewhat exhausting task. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Xi's report covered seven general areas, including: 
 
-- a summary of the Party's achievements in the past five years; 
 
-- a work plan for the coming five years; 
 
-- the city's economic development; 
 
-- strengthening "socialist democratic construction;" 
 
-- cultural development; 
 
-- constructing a "harmonious society;" and 
 
-- Party development. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Among the achievements of the past five years since 
Shanghai's Eighth Party Congress which Xi outlined were "stable 
and healthy economic development," "deeper opening and reform in 
'rule of law' and private economic development;" "new progress 
in building spiritual civilization;" improving living conditions 
in urban and rural areas; and continuous "Party-building". 
Interestingly, a section on the importance of environmental 
protection directly followed one on economic construction. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Xi noted the importance of anti-corruption efforts and 
stated that "Comrade Chen Liangyu's" pension scandal damaged the 
local leadership, destroyed the image of Shanghai and the local 
Party and had a negative impact on Shanghai's reform and 
development.  He said the serious punishment for Chen Liangyu's 
violation of the law reflected the Central Committee's firm 
determination in its anti-corruption work.  The scandal also had 
exposed weakness in the Party's institutional development, 
including an inadequate recognition of the complexity, 
difficulty, urgency and timespan of the anti-corruption task; 
immature systematization; a lack of democracy in the Party's 
decision-making process; an immature cadre selection system; and 
lack of attention to developing an appropriate work style among 
cadres.  Xi added that any person who violated laws and 
regulations, no matter what position they had been appointed to, 
would receive serious punishment.  Xi concluded that the 
Shanghai government, overall, had gained good experience and 
learned lessons in the past five years.   He encouraged 
officials to improve the Party's governance capacity, be 
concerned about people's well being and quality of life issues 
and strengthen power supervision. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In terms of the city's economic development, Xi said 
Shanghai faced a number of challenges including shortfalls in 
natural resources, inadequate development of a modern service 
industry; insufficient innovatiion; inadequate development of 
the private sector; an increasingly aging society; problems in 
creating employment; and gaps between urban and rural areas. 
Future work priorities were to hold a successful World Expo in 
2010 and fulfill the "four centers" -- to develop Shanghai into 
a global economic, trade, financial and shipping center. 
However, it was important to keep the bigger picture in mind, 
and ensure that Shanghai's future development was consistent

with national macro policies, including development of the 
Yangtze River Delta region, in order to achieve smooth 
development and build a harmonious society. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) From an ideological point of view, Xi noted repeatedly 
the importance of the "scientific development viewpoint" as well 
as the "three represents," the "four leads," "building a 
harmonious society," and Deng Xiaoping Theory, including 
"liberate thinking" and "seek truth from facts."  There was a 
single mention of Marxism and none whatsoever of Mao Zedong 
Thought. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Comment: Although we are routinely invited to observe 
the opening sessions of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress 
and Political Consultative Conference, this was the first time 
in the collective memory of the Shanghai Consular Corps that 
diplomats have been invited to observe a Party Congress. 
Furthermore, the session was broadcast live on local television 
and radio, in what appears to be an effort at somewhat greater 
transparency.   End Comment.
