SUBJECT: UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN SHANGHAI POSITIVE ABOUT SECRETARY'S 
VISIT, CAUTIOUS ABOUT FUTURE RELATIONS 
 
REF: SHANGHAI 41 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Secretary Clinton's visit to China in 
February and her comment that "we are in the same boat" left 
many university students in Shanghai with a positive impression, 
hopeful of future bilateral cooperation on the economic crisis 
and climate change.  Students in several roundtable discussions 
were generally optimistic about future bilateral relations but 
expressed concern that sensitive issues like human rights, 
Tibet, Taiwan, and trade protectionism could obstruct positive 
cooperation on other fronts.  One could also sense underlying 
anger at what some students view as an economic crisis created 
by the United States.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Poloff held separate roundtable discussions in 
Shanghai with students at Fudan University, Jiaotong University, 
Tongji University, and Shanghai International Studies University 
(SISU) in February and March.  The discussions involved a total 
of nearly 40 undergraduate, Masters, and PhD students, most 
majoring in international relations, public policy, political 
science, and finance.  This is the first of two reports on 
discussions with university students.  The second report will 
focus on Shanghai student perspectives on China's future and job 
prospects (see septel). 
 
Secretary's Visit Leaves Positive Impression 
--------------------------------------------- 
¶3.  (SBU) These university students in Shanghai told Poloff that 
they view Secretary's Clinton's visit to China in February a 
"success" because it laid the foundations for future discussion 
and cooperation between the two countries.  The visit drew much 
attention in China, as the Secretary is seen as a "star" by many 
Chinese.  One student said the Secretary appeared "powerful and 
sociable" during her visit.  Although one MA student at Tongji 
University thought the timing of the visit was not ideal given 
the Chinese leadership's focus at the time on preparations for 
the National People's Congress (NPC) and Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in early March, other 
students thought the timing was good, since it established a 
high level working relationship at an early stage of the new 
U.S. administration. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Many students were impressed by the Secretary's use of 
Chinese proverbs.  A PhD student from Fudan University said the 
Secretary's comment that "we are in the same boat" and "we are 
rowing in the same direction" particularly struck a positive 
chord with many Chinese, giving them a sense of "common destiny 
and interdependence."  Other students added that the Secretary's 
visit provided a powerful symbol of bilateral cooperation.  Some 
students, however, said they thought the visit was more symbolic 
than substantive, the most substantive part being the 
announcement to continue a high-level strategic dialogue, which 
many Shanghai scholars and students view as one of the key 
successes of the Bush Administration's China policy (reftel). 
Even if there was little substance to the visit, said one MA 
student at Fudan, the "most important thing" for the Secretary 
this time was "to listen" rather than just criticize China on 
issues like human rights and Tibet.  Many students said they 
were pleasantly surprised the Secretary did not publicly raise 
these sensitive issues with the Chinese leaders. 
 
Cautious About Future Relations 
--------------------------------- 
¶5.  (SBU) Most of the students told Poloff they are generally 
optimistic about the future of U.S.-China relations.  They 
emphasized the need for greater bilateral cooperation in 
combating the economic crisis and climate change, and they were 
happy to see these issues highlighted during the Secretary's 
visit.  Regarding climate change in particular, the students 
were optimistic that President Obama would take the lead in 
forging a global consensus, some hoping the United States will 
show "signs of commitment" to this issue in the near future.  At 
the same time, however, several students said it will take time 
for China to "turn green" and that the world should be patient 
with China. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Uncertainties, however, remain in the bilateral 
relationship over sensitive issues like human rights, Tibet, and 
Taiwan, said several students.  Some expressed their hope that

the United States can talk to China about human rights in ways 
that can help China improve its situation rather than alienate 
it.  Several students pointed to Taiwan as the central sticking 
point in U.S.-China relations.  The cross-Strait situation will 
not be resolved for several decades, said one MA student at 
Tongji, but the United States should just let both sides 
continue to talk.  An MA student at Jiaotong University thinks 
China remains suspicious of U.S. intentions regarding Taiwan and 
said China should "keep a close eye" on the United States 
(vis-`-vis Taiwan), even if overall bilateral relations improve. 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Several students expressed concern that the 
Democratic-controlled U.S. Congress will formulate tough trade 
policies on China.  With the Democrats in power, increased 
protectionism could become a "short-term obstacle" to good 
relations, said a PhD student from Fudan University.  Some 
students also expressed concern (and a certain degree of 
misunderstanding, which Poloff tried to clarify) over the "Buy 
American" provision in the U.S. fiscal stimulus package. 
Several students emphasized that most Chinese people want to be 
friends with the United States but that it is up to the United 
States to reciprocate through its actions on some of these 
sensitive issues. 
 
Comment 
-------- 
¶8.  (SBU) The student roundtables were conducted as open, 
informal conversations with minimal "adult" supervision.  The 
Jiaotong and SISU discussions were held without the presence of 
any professors while one Fudan professor and one Tongji 
professor, both already well-known to Poloff, were present at 
the Fudan and Tongji roundtables.  The students represent a 
microcosm of thinking at some of these elite universities in 
Shanghai.  Although most were positive about Secretary Clinton's 
visit to China and the future of U.S.-China relations, when 
discussion shifted to the effects of the economic crisis on 
their own lives and job prospects (to be reported septel), one 
could sense underlying anger at what some of these students view 
as a crisis created by the United States.
