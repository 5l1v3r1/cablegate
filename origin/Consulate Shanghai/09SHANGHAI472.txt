¶1. U.S.-China relations received an emotional boost December 3 
as Ambassador Huntsman and wife Mary Kaye brought their daughter 
Gracie Mei to visit the city where they adopted her in 1999. 
Yangzhou officials and the Yangzhou Children's Welfare Institute 
spared no effort in preparing an ebullient homecoming for the 
Yangzhou-born Gracie and her parents. Local and national media 
followed suit, with extensive and positive stories highlighting 
the ambassador's personal connection to Yangzhou, Jiangsu 
Province, and China. End summary

¶2. The Huntsmans' visit to Yangzhou, a city of 4.5 million on 
the north bank of the Yangtze river in Jiangsu province, was 
their first since adopting Gracie ten years ago this month. 
Yangzhou Party Secretary Ms. Wang Yanwen, calling Gracie by her 
Chinese name "Yang Leyi," proclaimed her an ambassador of 
Yangzhou. The Ambassador and family arrived at the Welfare 
Institute to a drum corps welcome and proceeded immediately to a 
tree-planting ceremony, welcome speeches by Yangzhou government 
officials including Party Secretary Wang and the Institute's 
Director Ms. Liu Aiping, and a tour through a newly-built 
facility. The visit concluded with a press conference.

¶3. Chinese media at both the national and the regional levels 
carried highly positive coverage of the Welfare Institute visit. 
In addition to talking about the strength of the bilateral 
relationship, the Ambassador noted that taking on his assignment 
to China carried additional personal significance. Many stories, 
especially by papers based in Jiangsu Province, hailed the visit 
as opening a new door for cooperation between the U.S. and 
Jiangsu. When asked about U.S.-China relations in the Jiangsu 
context, the Ambassador talked about the importance of both 
educational exchange and economic cooperation, ending by noting 
his own "ties of the heart."

Exposure Could Generate More Donations

¶4. Director Liu told Consul General that the Institute had 
previously welcomed back children who had been adopted by 
non-Chinese families to similar fanfare. The Institute's budget 
is largely dependent on government funding as part of the 
Yangzhou Civil Affairs Bureau, she explained, but is also 
supplemented by private donations. The positive media coverage 
generated by high profile visits such as the Ambassador's could 
result in increased donations to the Institute. 
 
¶5. According to its website, the Yangzhou Children's Welfare 
Institute was first established in 1968 and moved to its present 
location in 1982. Foreign adoptions began in 1989. When asked by 
Consulate EconOff whether recent trends pointed to growing 
Chinese government preference for domestic families over foreign 
families in adoption cases, Liu demurred, stating "our only 
concern is that these children are accepted into a loving family 
with sufficient resources to raise them."
