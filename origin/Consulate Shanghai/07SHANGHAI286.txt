¶1.  (SBU) Summary. During an April 18 lunch hosted by the 
President of the Shanghai Youth Daily, four senior editors from 
the paper who had recently returned from an International 
Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) reported that they came back 
from their IVLP trip with overwhelmingly positive views of the 
United States.  As a result of the trip, they had begun to 
incorporate more news about the United States in the newspaper. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Four senior editors from the Shanghai Youth Daily, the 
mouthpiece of the Shanghai Communist Youth League (circ. 
400,000), recently returned from a March 2007 International 
Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) with wholly positive views of 
the United States.  The participants in the Single-Country IVLP 
entitled "The Role of a Free Press in a Democratic Society" 
included the Executive Deputy Editor-in-Chief, the Head of the 
Comprehensive News Section, the Editor of the Political News 
Section, and the Editor of the Domestic and International News 
Section, all of whom had recently been promoted into their new 
positions and were ideally suited to take maximum advantage of 
their first-ever visit to the U.S. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The four usually staid editors were anxious to regale 
the Shanghai Public Affairs Officer (PAO) with tales of their 
U.S. visit at a lunch hosted by the President of the Shanghai 
Youth Daily shortly after their return on April 18.  They were 
bubbling over with enthusiasm about their trip around the United 
States and fairly bursting with positive impressions of people 
they had met and places they had visited.  The morning before 
the luncheon, the four had conducted a lengthy briefing of their 
fellow journalists and editors at the Shanghai Youth Daily, a 
requirement imposed by their Editor-in-Chief on anyone who 
travels overseas.  Not only did the four speak about their 
experiences and the contacts they had made, but they showed a 
photo montage they created of the places they had visited - 
Washington, DC, New York, Tampa, Dallas and San Francisco - and 
also passed around hard copies of dozens of newspapers they had 
collected from around the U.S.  They recounted how they had to 
mail the newspapers back to themselves at considerable expense, 
but were willing to do so because they felt strongly that hard 
copies were "so much more useful as references than the online 
versions anyone can read." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The four editors reported that they had read up on the 
U.S. before their journey, including Alexis de Tocqueville's 
"Democracy in America" (in Chinese), but they described their IV 
trip as a "seeing-is-believing tour of the U.S."  They said the 
trip "helped turn their abstract views about the U.S. 
government, society and culture that they learned from books 
into vivid pictures." They said that before they visited the 
U.S., they viewed its history as far too short (in comparison 
with China's) to be worthy of much attention, but they were 
deeply impressed with how America has succeeded in preserving 
its history and how average Americans are dedicated to 
respecting the past.  For example, they were struck by the 
number of monuments America has to its past and how widely 
visited they are, whereas China, in their words, has done a poor 
job of preserving its past and its few monuments are in shabby 
condition and rarely visited. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The editors also reported that they were deeply moved 
to have an opportunity to see with their own eyes how "advanced 
and civilized" American society was and how deeply ingrained the 
respect for the rule of law was in American society.  This was 
something they had heard about before going to the United 
States, but having seen American society in action, they 
commented that "this is one area where China can definitely 
learn from the U.S."  They were excited to have visited several 
American newspapers and had a chance to meet with their 
professional counterparts, both at large nationally influential 
newspapers and at small, local papers.  They were also struck by 
the power of the American economy - "imagine how much economic 
strength is contained in that one narrow Wall Street" - and saw 
firsthand the flood of made-in-China products on the American 
market.  They commented that it was impossible to find souvenirs 
for their families that weren't "made in China." 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The trip also appeared to have led to some positive 
changes in Shanghai Youth Daily's coverage of U.S. news.  Almost 
immediately on their return, they set about revising the layout 
 
SHANGHAI 00000286  002 OF 002 
 
 
of the Shanghai Youth Daily to incorporate more news about the 
U.S. on a daily basis, a move their Editor-in-Chief heartily 
welcomed and that bodes well for enhanced U.S.-China mutual 
understanding. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Comment: While we have no illusions that one visit to 
the U.S. will bring a free press to China overnight, the IV 
program clearly has helped to improve the image of the United 
States among a key group.  After their IV trip, the four clearly 
had a better understanding of the United States and an 
appreciation of the importance to China of good relations with 
the United States.
