SUBJECT: PEACEBUILDING WORKSHOPS GAINING MOMENTUM 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: The Peacebuilding Center for the Horn of 
Africa (PCHA) hosted its third Embassy-sponsored workshop for 
eastern Sudanese participants during the week of June 21-27. 
The week-long workshop included lively presentations, 
discussions, simulations, and lectures.  The most recent 
workshop hosted 40 participants, 10 more than initially 
budgeted.  The workshop is one in a five-part series, each 
workshop focusing on different aspects of building a system 
of government in Sudan.  The workshop series, which has been 
highly lauded by Eritrean and Sudanese officials, continues 
to grow in size and popularity as more and more applicants 
vie for limited slots.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) The PCHA is an Asmara-based nongovernmental 
organization (NGO) that runs a variety of programs focused on 
promoting peace and sustainability in the Horn of Africa 
region, particularly in Sudan.  Embassy Asmara has provided 
the PCHA with $150,000, funded by an ESF grant, to conduct 
five, week-long workshops focused on familiarizing eastern 
Sudanese NGOs with the process of promoting peace, civil 
society, and democracy.  Although the initial workshop met 
with complications (a dozen unmarried female participants 
were barred by Sudanese authorities from leaving Sudan to 
attend the workshop), the workshops have since been filled to 
capacity and flooded with applications. 
 
¶3. (U) Each seven-day workshop is divided into three-hour 
lectures and discussions, with guest presenters scattered 
throughout. PolOff attended a portion of the most recent 
workshop, themed "Preparation and Participation in General 
Elections," and found the participants engaged in a lively 
discussion on defining the social responsibility of Sudanese 
and international organizations in the peace building 
process.  The discussion took place just after a presentation 
from the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) on the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and was followed by 
rounds of in-depth conversation during the dinner break. 
 
¶4. (U) Several articles have appeared about the workshops in 
Sudanese newspapers.  The workshops have even become a 
talking point for the Eritrean government; Abdullah Jaber, 
the ruling party's Director of Organizational Affairs with a 
special emphasis on Eritrean-Sudanese relations, regularly 
praises the PCHA's efforts and uses his clout to support the 
USG-funded workshops.  The PCHA is already fielding phone 
calls from varying Sudanese factions all wanting to reserve 
slots for the upcoming fourth workshop, themed "Election 
Tecniques and Strategies," which is scheduled to be held in 
late August.  Although the workshop guidelines stipulate that 
participants can only attend one workshop, the PCHA is 
creating a sixth workshop for the "best of the best" 
participants from the first five workshops. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The PCHA is led by Dr. Taisier M. Ali, who also 
founded the organization.  Ali is perhaps one of the most 
well-respected non-Eritreans living in Asmara.  His counsel 
is sought by not only Abdullah Jaber, but also high-ranking 
officials of the Asmara-based Alliance for the Re-Liberation 
of Somalia (ARS) as well as Sudanese and GOSS officials.  Ali 
remains adamant that the work being done by the PCHA is 
"merely a drop in the bucket," in terms of promoting the 
needed stability in Sudan.  However, he believes the USG's 
support for the PCHA's peace-building efforts are nonetheless 
needed and important.
