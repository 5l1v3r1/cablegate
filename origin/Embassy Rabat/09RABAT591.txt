SUBJECT: MOROCCO FLOATS GLOBAL INITIATIVE UN RESOLUTION AND 
WANTS IN ON PLANNED NONPROLIFERATION SUMMIT 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Morocco continues to seek global 
leadership in nonproliferation affairs.  In the wake of being 
host to the first conference of the Global Initiative to 
Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT), the Government of Morocco 
(GOM) is proposing to co-author, with the United States and 
Russia, a United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolution 
recognizing the GICNT.  Also, upon hearing of the 
international nuclear nonproliferation summit proposed to the 
G-8 in Italy by POTUS for 2010, Moroccan officials have 
suggested that the GOM's solid track record merited Morocco 
being among twenty to thirty-five countries invited.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Polcouns and D/Polcouns met with Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) International Organizations Director Azzedine 
Farhane on July 9 to discuss the GICNT issue.  Farhane used 
the meeting to propose to the United States introducing a 
joint Moroccan, U.S., and Russian resolution before the UNGA 
this Fall to endorse the GICNT.  Farhane provided Polcouns 
with a copy of a draft U.N. resolution for U.S. consideration 
(paragraph 3).  Farhane said the GOM was also seeking 
concurrence from Russia (Note: the U.S. and Russia are 
co-chairs of GICNT).  Embassy submits the below text for 
Department consideration. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Draft Resolution Text Follows: 
 
Draft resolution of the 64th session of the General Assembly 
related to the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism 
 
By Morocco, The United States of America, The Russian 
Federation 
 
The General Assembly, 
 
Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the 
Charter of the United Nations, and reaffirming its respect 
for and commitment to international law, 
 
Referring to the Security Council Resolutions 1373 (2001) on 
Threats to international peace and security caused by 
terrorist acts and 1540 (2004) on non proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, 
 
Recalling the adoption by consensus of the Convention for the 
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, the Convention on 
the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and its 2005 
Amendment, 
 
Determined to prevent the illicit trafficking in nuclear and 
radioactive materials and substances and the potential 
terrorist threats using such materials, 
 
Acknowledging the crucial role of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) in the fields of nuclear safety and 
security, 
 
Reaffirming the responsibility of all States to contribute to 
the international stability and security, 
 
Convinced that international cooperation and dialogue are the 
only appropriate way to address this threat to international 
peace and security, 
 
Emphasizing the importance to develop partnership capacity to 
combat nuclear terrorism on a determined and systematic basis 
consistent with national legal authorities and obligations 
they have under relevant international legal frameworks, 
 
Considering the principles and terms of references of the 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism adopted in its 
first meeting in Rabat on 31 October 2006, 
 
Taking note of the commitments of the State Partners during 
the subsequent meetings of the Global Initiative held in 
Astana, Ankara, Madrid and The Hague, 
 
            ¶1.    Welcomes the Global Initiative as a 
contribution to the international action against Nuclear 
Terrorism and to the international security. 
 
            ¶2.    Expresses its satisfaction to its operative 
framework of cooperation between State Partners and voluntary 
activities aiming at combating nuclear terrorism and building 
necessary capacities to prevent and respond to eventual 
threats. 
 
 
            ¶3.     Encourages members States of the United 
Nations to adhere to the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  MFA's Ambassador Nasser Bourita, Director-General 
for Multilateral Affairs, told Polcouns later on July 9 that 
the GOM was pleased and encouraged to hear of President 
Obama's call for an international non-proliferation summit. 
In the GOM's view, Morocco merits an invitation to such a 
summit as one of the twenty to thirty-five proposed 
participants, because of its solid nonproliferation record, 
including: its hosting of the first GICNT meeting, extensive 
participation in GICNT, association with the Proliferation 
Security Initiative, and cooperation in the nonproliferation 
agenda as a former member of the IAEA Board of Governors. 
"Besides, such an initiative would benefit from having a 
relatively small developing country participate," Bourita 
added.  Morocco would appreciate being kept in mind and kept 
apprised of U.S. thinking as the conference approaches. 
Bourita's message was underscored the next day by another 
meeting with Farhane who said he had been instructed by 
Foreign Minister Fassi Fihri to convey GOM interest in the 
proposed summit.
