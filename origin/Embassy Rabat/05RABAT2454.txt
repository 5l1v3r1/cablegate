¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered ref(a) demarche on December 5 to 
MFA Director of the Division for Humanitarian and Social 
Issues Sidi Abdelfattah El Kadiri and discussed ref(b) urgent 
demarche to vote in favor of the MDA with El Kadiri on 
December 7.   Kadiri said he understood that the Swiss had 
held meetings in Geneva to resolve the issue, that the 
conference was going "well," and that everyone was supportive 
of the adoption of the Third Additional Protocol.  When asked 
about Syrian intransigence, Kadiri said he thought that the 
remaining issue was limited to an agreement to be signed 
between Syria and Israel regarding the competencies of the 
different associations.  Kadiri indicated that this would not 
likely be enough to block the adoption of the Third 
Additional Protocol.  That said, Kadiri pledged to contact 
the Moroccan delegation in Geneva to get the most recent 
information and convey our demarche request to them.
