UN COMMISSION ON NARCOTIC DRUGS MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 19274 
 
¶1.  On February 29th, POLOFF provided Moroccan Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Chief of Principal UN Offices Redouane 
Houssaini with small briefing, accompanied by a diplomatic 
note, on US priorities at the upcoming UN Commission on 
Narcotic Drugs being held March 10-14. 
 
¶2.  Mr. Houssaini thanked Poloff for his message, including 
the draft texts of the two resolutions (reftel) that the USG 
intends to table at the meeting, adding that the Government 
of Morocco (GOM) was, in principle, supportive of the two 
resolutions.  He said that MFA Chief of Service for Global 
Issues Ms. Talmi Nodya, present during the demarche, would 
attend the UN Commission meeting with the rest of the GOM 
delegation. 
 
¶3.  Regarding the first resolution pertaining to medical 
screening, Mr. Houssaini said that the GOM would likely have 
several amendments to the resolution.  He highlighted the 
GOM's preliminary views that the UNODC should be recognized 
as the principle office associated with this resolution and 
the GOM's desire to add language to the resolution to address 
the need for financial support for its successful 
implementation. 
 
¶4.  On the second resolution pertaining to highlighting the 
dangers of cannabis use by adolescents, he said that his 
Ministry would favorably study it and forward it to their 
Ambassador in Vienna.
