¶1.  (SBU)  On October 31, Emboffs delivered reftel talking 
points to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Division Chief for 
Multilateral Economic Cooperation Zakia El Midaoui, to Khalid 
Sayeh of the Foreign Trade Ministry, and to Hassan Serghini, 
Director of Planning and Economic Affairs at the Moroccan 
Ministry of Agriculture.  As in earlier discussions (ref B), 
Moroccan MFA and trade officials agreed that EU proposals "do 
not go far enough," and blame the French for blocking serious 
EU engagement on agriculture.  Moroccan officials did not 
offer to put pressure on the Commission or EU members to 
offer a more forward leaning position.
