¶1. (SBU) Fouad Yazourh, Director of American (Western 
Hemisphere) Affairs at the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs met Polcouns on May 16 and received a summary of USG 
interest in Cuban Solidarity Day.  Yazourh stated that the 
Moroccan Government has had no diplomatic relations with the 
Cuban Government for decades.  Cuba has been an active 
supporter of the anti-Moroccan Polisario movement in the 
Western Sahara and has even provided military assistance to 
the Polisario during the period of armed conflict in the 
1970's and 1980's .  Yazourh noted that his government has 
stood with the U.S. in condemning Cuba,s human rights 
violations, and appreciated hearing about the May 21 Cuba 
Solidarity Day.  Given the extremely low profile of the issue 
here, however, the Government of Morocco has not planned any 
statment or activity. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Reflective of the ontinuing Moroccan support for the 
people of Cuba, vice the government, the music group Los Van 
Van played on May 17 at the independent, but 
government-supported, Rabat world music festival.
