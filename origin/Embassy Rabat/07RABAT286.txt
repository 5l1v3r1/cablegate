¶1.  This cable is sensitive but unclassified, please protect 
accordingly. 
 
 ¶2.  (U) On February 7, Morocco was elected to the presidency 
of the Francophone Association of National Human Rights 
Institutions (AFCNDH).  Niger was elected to the 
vice-presidency; France was elected to the position of 
secretary-general; and, Mauritania was elected to be 
 
SIPDIS 
treasurer. Twenty countries attended the February 5-7 
congress held in Rabat which focused on cultural diversity 
and cultural rights promotion. Morocco is a 2002 founding 
member of AFCNDH, which is organized in conjunction with the 
International Organization of Francophone Countries (OIF).  A 
Moroccan member of the Consultative Council on Human Rights 
(CCDH), M. Abderrazzak Guennoun, was the first AFCNDH 
treasurer.  The first congress was held in Montreal in 
September 2005 and focused on economic, social and cultural 
rights. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Comment:  Morocco is assuming a leadership 
position among Francophone countries as well as Arab 
countries in human rights viewed from an expansive 
perspective including economic and social, as well as 
political rights.  In addition to reflecting its diplomatic 
prowess, the vote probably also reflects the perception that 
Morocco really is ahead of the curve regionally on human 
rights.  While issues of concern remain, for example, the 
relative freedom of the press, the passing of an anti-torture 
law in March 2006, and the 2004 family law, concessions to 
language minorities, and the informal moratorium and 
developing consensus on the halting of capital punishment are 
examples of the kinds of changes for which Morocco is being 
recognized.  End Comment.
