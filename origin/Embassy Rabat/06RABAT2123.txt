¶1. (SBU) Aminetou Haidar, the prominent Sahrawi human rights 
activist, returned to her home in Layoune on November 15, 
following an extended trip abroad.   According to an account 
posted on the website of the Polisario Front, confirmed by 
Embassy contacts in Western Sahara, Haidar arrived at Layoune 
airport on a flight from the Canary Islands accompanied by 
two representatives of Spanish human rights NGOs as well as 
an activist Italian judge. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The flight was met by Moroccan police, who insisted 
that only Moroccan citizens could disembark.  Haidar 
initially balked, maintaining that she is a Sahrawi rather 
than Moroccan citizen (although she travels on a Moroccan 
passport) but she eventually disembarked and was admitted 
without incident.  The European NGO representatives did not 
deplane at Layoune. 
 
¶3. (SBU) A large group of Sahrawi activists gathered at 
Haidar's Layoune home to welcome her back.  There was a 
conspicuous security force presence outside Haidar's home, 
but no reported interference in her "welcome back" party. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Embassy will continue to monitor closely 
Haidar's status and the overall human rights situation in 
Western Sahara.
