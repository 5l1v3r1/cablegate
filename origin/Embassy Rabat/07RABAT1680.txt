REF: CASABLANCA 192 
 
¶1.  Included in this round up: the tourism sector continues to grow, 
air traffic increases, the automobile sector gains an investor, the 
problems at Casablanca Port are resolved, and the energy sector is 
set to grow. 
 
------------- 
TOURISM GROWS 
------------- 
 
¶2.  Approximately 5.2 million tourists visited Morocco in the first 
eight months of 2007, an increase of 12 percent year-on-year.  In 
addition, over one million tourists visited the country in July 
alone, according to the Ministry of Tourism.  During the same 
period, tourism receipts increased 11 percent to USD 5.1 billion. 
Tourism receipts are the country's main source of foreign currency. 
The number of nights that tourists spent in hotels increased six 
percent for the same period, reaching 11.9 million.  Marrakech 
remains the leading tourist destination and had a growth rate of 11 
percent for the period, followed by Casablanca (10 percent), Tangier 
(9 percent) and Fez (7 percent). The GOM hopes to attract 10 million 
tourists per year by 2010. 
 
--------------------- 
AIR TRAFFIC INCREASES 
--------------------- 
 
¶3.  During the first eight months of 2007, the number of 
international passengers transiting Moroccan airports increased 20 
percent to 6.7 million compared to 5.6 million during the same 
period of 2006.  Almost half (48 percent) of the passengers used 
Casablanca's Mohamed V Airport hub, while the country's two 
principal tourist destinations, Marrakech and Agadir, received 28 
percent and 12 percent of passengers respectively.  The MinistQ of 
Transport hailed the introduction of new discount airlines EasyJet, 
RyanAir, Jet4You, and Aigle Azur as being largely responsible for 
this increase. 
 
-------------------------------- 
NEW AUTOMOBILE SECTOR INVESTMENT 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Renault-Nissan Alliance announced a new USD 840 million 
investment in Morocco to manufacture cars.  The initial phase of the 
investment will cost USD 490 million and produce 200,000 vehicles by 
¶2010.  Upon completion, the facility will manufacture 400,000 cars 
annually and create 6,000 new jobs, as well as 30,000 indirect jobs. 
 The plant will be built in the new free-trade port in Tangier and 
produce a new generation of light commercial vehicles for Nissan and 
variants of Renault's low-cost Logan car.  The company plans to 
export 90 percent of vehicles manufactured at the plant. 
 
--------------- 
INFLATION JUMPS 
--------------- 
 
¶5.  Consumer prices rose 2.2 percent in Morocco during the 
January-September period of 2007.  Housing and food prices led the 
increase, rising by 3.4 and 3.2 percent respectively.  However, 
inflation was up 1.3 percent in September alone, mainly due to a 2.7 
percent rise in food prices.  The GOM's predicted annual inflation 
rate of 2.0 percent for 2007 is threatened by this recent increase. 
 
 
--------- 
CASA PORT 
--------- 
 
¶6.  The congestion problem at Morocco's principal port, Casablanca 
(see reftel), has been largely resolved.  Ships had been delayed in 
docking and offloading for up to 14 days recently until customs and 
offload operations were increased to a 24/7 basis.  Empty containers 
had been clogging the port until additional storage space was made 
available, larger than expected seasonal increases in volume were 
complicated by reduced working hours during Ramadan, and operational 
changes due to recent reforms complicated matters further.  While 
the port has weathered this crisis, potential long-term problems of 
insufficient infrastructure and operational inefficiencies remain 
that could create as additional problems in the future. 
 
------ 
ENERGY 
------ 
 
¶7.  Morocco's rapidly growing demand for electricity (8 percent 
annually) has led to a number of activities to boost electrical 
production.  The National Electricity Office (ONE) recently 
introduced Initiative 1,000 MW to increase the country's wind energy 
capacity to 1,000 MG by 2012.  The Tarafaya Wind Farm Project plans 
to produce 300 MW of electricity in southern Morocco starting in 
¶2010.  In addition, the Energipro Initiative encourages some of 
Morocco's leading companies to produce their own power from 
renewable sources and offers that ONE will buy any surplus energy at 
an incentive price and assures the transit of all electricity. 
 
------- 
NUCLEAR 
------- 
 
¶8.  During French President Sarkozy's recent visit to Morocco he 
announced that France sought to cooperate with Morocco's civilian 
nuclear energy program.  Reportedly, representatives from the two 
governments will start negotiations on a framework agreement 
concerning the number and sites of the future plants.  Discussions 
could also cover the use of nuclear energy to desalinate sea water 
for water deficient Morocco.
