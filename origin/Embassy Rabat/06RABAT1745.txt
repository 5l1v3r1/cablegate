¶1.  (U) This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please 
protect accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On September 20, following a brief pre-meeting, 
Polcouns and Russian DCM Mikhail Golovanov jointly delivered 
the text of Statement of Principles, Explanatory Notes 
Regarding the Statement of Principles, and Terms of Reference 
for Implementation and Assessment (reftel) to Multilateral 
Affairs officer Azzeddin Farhane, the MFA's point of contact 
for the Global Initiative. Polcouns informed Farhane that the 
United States and Russia proposed to hold the first meeting 
23-24 October and also passed the draft text of the 
invitation for the GOM's consideration.  Farhane welcomed the 
documents and explained that the ministry was in the process 
of preparing the letters of invitation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Turning to the proposed dates of 23-24 October, 
Farhane offered his personal view that the proposed dates are 
likely to pose a problem because they coincide with the Eid 
feast that marks the end of Ramadan.  Speaking informally, he 
thought pushing the dates to the end of October, possibly 
30-31 October, would work better. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In closing, Farhane asked that the U.S. or Russian 
embassy provide the GOM with the names of the Initial Partner 
Nation Deputy Foreign Ministers to be invited to ensure 
proper addressing of the invitation letters. He reiterated 
that the GOM welcomes any further background and guidance, 
including on logistics, budget, and potential public posture. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Embassy is closely and fully coordinating with the 
local Russian embassy, which also is having a positive impact 
on the GOM.
