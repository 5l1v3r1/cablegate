(SBU) Polcouns delivered subject demarche to Director General 
for Arab and Islamic Relations Mohammed Azeroual on Dec. 1. 
Azeroual stated that the settlement moratorium in the West 
Bank was "a step forward, but incomplete."  He noted 
specifically excluding Jerusalem from the settlement 
moratorium was unacceptable for Palestinian President Abbas, 
and for much of the Arab world.  He confirmed the need for 
all parties to seize the opportunity of President Obama's 
engagement on the peace process and expressed Morocco's 
willingness to continue talking to all sides.  He also 
suggested that if the Israelis were to enforce a full, 
across-the-board moratorium applicable to all areas, they 
would see a positive response from Arab countries that have 
been less willing than Morocco to engage the Israeli side.
