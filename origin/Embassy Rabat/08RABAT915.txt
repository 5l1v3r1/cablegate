FREEDOM REPORTS DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 099226 
 
¶1.  Poloff delivered copies of the 2008 International 
Religious Freedom Reports (IRFRs) for Morocco and the Western 
Sahara to Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs Head of United 
Nations Division Azzedine Farhane with other copies to convey 
to Moroccan Minister of Endowments and Islamic Affairs Ahmed 
Toufiq on September 22.  English, French, and Arabic copies 
of the IRFRs were delivered and posted on Post's website. 
 
¶2.  Media reaction to the reports was widespread and largely 
laudatory.  The press stressed the positive aspects of the 
Morocco report, citing the passage saying that "Morocco 
continues to encourage tolerance, respect and dialogue among 
religious groups," and noting that Morocco is the only Arab 
country where there is a Jewish museum.  At the same time, 
the press cited cases mentioned in the report of harassment 
of Christian groups, as well as negative attitudes towards 
Ba'hais. 
 
¶3.  Moroccan independent French-language daily Le Soir 
carried an article entitled, "Religion Freedom: Washington 
spares Morocco," reporting that "in the State Department's 
annual report, published last Friday, the U.S. spared Morocco 
once more from the list of Arab states that are most 
religiously intolerant.  This list is headed by Algeria, 
Jordan, and Egypt in 2007-08." 
 
¶4.  Islamist Arabic-language daily Attajdid also carried an 
article on the IRFR entitled "Abdessalam Ballaji: The U.S. 
report on religious freedom is a means to help extremist 
Evangelical groups."  The article is based on a brief 
interview with Abdessalam Ballaji, a Moroccan researcher on 
Islam and political science, who stated that, "The report on 
freedom of religions, issued annually by the State 
Department, is used as a means of pressure on countries, 
especially Islamic countries, to allow extremist evangelical 
groups to find a foothold among (its) peoples...and to create 
Christian minorities that would allow America to intervene 
later on the pretext of protecting those minorities from 
religious oppression and safeguarding their rights." 
 
¶5.  The Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested that 
the IRFR be included as a part of the annual Country Reports 
on Human Rights Practices.  We have explained the separate 
legislative mandate and may reiterate the explanation during 
the next human rights dialogue.
