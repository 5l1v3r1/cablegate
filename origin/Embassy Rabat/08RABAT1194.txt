¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Chairman of the Commission on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Representative Alcee Hastings 
encouraged members of the Morocco's lower house of parliament 
to press the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe Parliamentary Assembly (OSCEPA) to allow greater 
participation by non-member partner states in OSCEPA 
meetings.  He proposed holding a formal consultation in the 
CSCE in Washington with OSCEPA Mediterranean Partners to 
discuss ways to update and reform the OSCE and suggested he 
could accept an intern from Morocco.  The Moroccan 
parliamentarians welcomed the visit and expressed interest in 
Hastings' proposals.  They encouraged the United States to 
continue pushing for a resolution to the Western Sahara 
issue.   End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
The OSCE and its Mediterranean Partners 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In a December 1 meeting with members of the 
Moroccan Chamber of Deputies (lower house of parliament), 
CSCE Chairman Representative Alcee Hastings (D - FL), who was 
in Morocco as the special representative of the Chairman of 
the OSCEPA, encouraged Moroccan Members of Parliament (MPs) 
to pressure the Parliamentary Assembly to amend its rules to 
allow for greater participation by non-member observer 
states, such as Morocco, at OSCEPA meetings.  He specifically 
suggested that they request a clarification of the definition 
of an oral question in OSCEPA by-laws to allow non-members 
greater latitude to engage in OSCE ministerial and 
parliamentary deliberations.  Hastings commended Morocco for 
its substantive engagement in the OSCE's Mediterranean 
Partners program and offered to invite appropriate MPs to a 
consultation session he is planning to hold in Washington, DC 
in 2009 in the CSCE to gather input from non-member OSCE 
partners on reforming and updating the organization. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Rep. Hasting's host at parliament, Mustapha 
Ibrahimy, Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' Human Rights 
Committee and member of the leftist Union of Popular 
Socialist Forces (USFP), said that the Chamber's President, 
Mustapha Mansouri, had wanted to meet Rep. Hastings, but was 
regrettably overseas.  Migration and trafficking issues 
(human and narcotic) occupied much of the Chamber's 
engagement with European parliamentarians.  Through its 
representatives to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, the 
Chamber remains committed to continued dialogue within a 
"framework of respect for human rights and women's equality." 
 He and others expressed interest in Hasting's proposed 
hearing. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Morocco, Algeria and Western Sahara 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Ibrahimy and others criticized Algeria for refusing 
to open its border with Morocco, which was "catastrophic" and 
a "threat to regional security and integration."  Ibrahimy 
grumbled that Algiers ignored King Mohammed VI's overtures 
and conciliatory gestures.  Member of the Islamist-inspired 
Party of Justice and Development (PJD) and Second 
Vice-President of Parliament Abdallah Baha said that recent 
statements by Polisario leadership alluding to a return to 
armed struggle were "unhelpful" and he urged the USG to 
remain engaged.  USFP MP Khalid El Hariri said "this frozen 
conflict served nobody's purposes." 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Khalid El Hariri warned against taking too 
simplistic a view of what constituted security, saying that 
economic development, more effective intelligence services, 
trusted police, equality and justice all "conspired" to 
create a safe Morocco and that "no one thread could be broken 
from the others" in the pursuit of stability.  He added that 
environmental issues should be part of the security debate. 
He criticized the USG for not participating in the Kyoto 
climate discussions and encouraged the incoming Obama 
administration to do so.

A Woman's Voice 
--------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Mbarka Bouaida, of the centrist National Rally of 
Independents (RNI), the lone woman in the group, said that 
increasing women's participation in the political process was 
one of the most important challenges currently before 
Parliament.  She said that new amendments to the electoral 
code passed on November 28 were designed to increase female 
representation at the local and national level from under 1 
percent to 12 to 15 percent.  She expressed a hope the OSCE 
Mediterranean Partner program could help support Morocco's 
efforts to promote women's representation. 
 
----------------------------- 
Almost No Parliamentary Staff 
----------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Rep. Hastings strongly encouraged the legislature 
to strengthen professional staff capacity and training in 
order to improve institutional ability to research and 
produce appropriate legislation.  As an example, Rep. 
Hastings explained that he has 17 staffers in his 
congressional office and 13 attached to his CSCE position. 
One of the Moroccans ruefully retorted, "I have one tea 
server."  (Note: Parliament as a whole has only has a limited 
cadre of staffers.  Many are hired for patronage, performing 
basic service functions only.  Members have no personal 
professional legislative staff.  End Note.)  In response, 
Rep. Hastings made a standing offer to place a Moroccan staff 
intern in his office if parliament sent him one, to begin the 
exchange of ideas and skills between the U.S. Congress and 
Moroccan Parliament.  Some deputies expressed interest in 
this proposal. 
 
¶8.  (U) Rep. Hastings did not have an opportunity to clear 
this cable before his departure.
