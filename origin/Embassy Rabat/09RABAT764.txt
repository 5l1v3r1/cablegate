 ¶1. (SBU) On September 10, PolCouns and DPolCouns delivered 
reftel information to Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
United Nations and International Organizations Director 
Azzedine Farhane and United Nations Division Chief Redouane 
Houssaini.  PolCouns highlighted reftel background on 
nonproliferation, peacekeeping, human rights, and Arab 
states' normalization of relations with Israel as issues of 
particular importance.  Farhane in response outlined Moroccan 
efforts to promote the first three, but he did not engage the 
fourth.  He applauded the U.S. decision to return to the 
Human Rights Council, noting that Morocco was the first 
country to urge in writing that the US reengage with the 
Council. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In discussing Moroccan goals and objectives for UNGA 
64, Farhane and Houssaini highlighted the environment, the 
global economic crisis, peacekeeping operations, and the 
Western Sahara as issues on which Morocco would focus. 
Regarding the last, he reasserted support for the process 
undertaken by UNSYG Personal Envoy Christopher Ross.  He 
noted as well that Morocco hopes to gain a seat on the 
Security Council as a non-permanent member in 2011.  Post 
will forward additional information on Moroccan UNGA 
engagement as it becomes available.
