NPT-RELATED ISSUES 
 
REF: STATE 83600 
 
¶1. (SBU) Virtually all decision making on non-proliferation 
matters is generated in the Moroccan Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA).  Within the MFA, Head of the United Nations 
Division Redoune Houssaini and Head of Security and 
Disarmament Bouchiab Omni can be considered the two most 
important working-level players on nuclear non-proliferation 
issues.  Both of these individuals report to MFA Director 
General for Multilateral Affairs (and MFA Chief of Staff) 
Ambassador Nasser Bourita.  Bourita reports directly the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Taieb Fassi Fihri.  Moroccan 
Ambassadors to their missions to Vienna, New York, and Geneva 
can also be considered among relevant players within Moroccan 
MFA decision-making apparatus. 
¶2. (U) Post's point-of-contact on NPT-related issues is 
Deputy Polcouns David O'Connor.
