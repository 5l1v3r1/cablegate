¶1.  (U) This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please 
protect accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Following up on reftels, Poloff met April 20 with 
MFA Bilateral Affairs Officer Karim Halim to discuss Moroccan 
participation in COESPU's second round of classes in May. 
Confirming the Moroccan Gendarmerie had indeed notified the 
Italian Defense Attache in Rabat they would not be able to 
participate in upcoming COESPU classes, Halim explained the 
Gendarmerie's difficulties.  Halim argued that it is very 
hard for the Gendarmerie to find a candidate who has the 
appropriate English capabilities, who would benefit from this 
type of training, and is also available to travel to Italy 
for either four or six weeks.  Halim added that, in his view, 
if French translation were provided, selection of appropriate 
candidates from the Gendarmerie would be easier, but "would 
not be guaranteed."  In addition, Halim pointed out that 
Morocco was asked to nominate over 30 candidates last year, 
but only asked to have 6 participate this year.  He wondered 
if being asked for only 6 candidates this year is the result 
of the number of participants Morocco sent in 2005. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On the possibility of military personnel attending 
in the place of the Gendarmerie, Halim said it would be 
necessary for COESPU to send a new official request to that 
effect, as the initial request was very specific in asking 
for Gendarmerie, not "standard" military.  According to 
Halim, a request for military candidates would essentially 
change the scope of COESPU in Morocco's view, because the 
Moroccan military is not a "gendarme-like force."  He added 
if COESPU asked the military at this late stage, they could 
run the risk of receiving a negative reaction to the request 
from the military.  The military would wonder why they were 
not asked to participate last year, and why they are being 
asked only after the Gendarmerie could not send candidates, 
he said.  In closing, Poloff reiterated US support for 
Moroccan participation in COESPU.  Halim pledged to contact 
the Embassy if he receives new information.  Post will report 
further responses septel.
