SUBJECT: IMPLEMENTATION OF BOYCOTT STATUTES - MOROCCO 
 
REF: SECSTATE 66895 
 
 (SBU)  While in response to questions about the Arab League 
Boycott (ALB), Moroccan government (GOM) contacts tell 
emboffs officially that as a member of the Arab League, 
Morocco conforms and adheres to all League decisions, in 
practice informal Moroccan-Israeli commercial ties exist and 
the GOM does not enforce the boycott.  In the GOM's official 
trade figures, Israeli imports and exports are not listed. 
However, the Moroccan press has reported that according to 
the Israel Export and International Cooperation Institute, 
Morocco is Israel's fourth largest Arab export market -- 
Israeli exports were reportedly USD 11.2 million in 2005. 
When publicly pressed on the ALB issue, ministers simply 
state that Morocco does not have official relations with 
Israel.  Business contacts say "everybody knows there is 
trade and cooperation."  In the mid-1990s (peaking in about 
1996), there were open contacts between Israeli and Moroccan 
business groups and press reports of discussions on 
investments and deepening commercial ties.  There is no GOM 
office to monitor the ALB.  Emboffs are unaware of any laws 
on the books regarding boycotts.  The GOM does not enforce 
the ALB (or any other boycott), nor does it require U.S. 
companies operating in Morocco to adhere to it.  Post is 
unaware of any legal or regulatory requirement for businesses 
to comply with boycotts.  Jewish Israeli tourists (including 
pilgrims) visit Morocco regularly without incident. 
Businessmen say that Israeli products enter Morocco via third 
countries.  In sum, in practice, the boycott does not exist.
