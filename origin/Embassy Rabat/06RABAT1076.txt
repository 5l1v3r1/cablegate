¶1.  Post received the following Diplomatic Note on May 22, 
2006, a copy of which has been faxed to NEA/MAG.  Unofficial 
translation begins in paragraph two. 
 
¶2. Begin unofficial translation: 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation presents its 
compliments to the Embassy of the United States of America in 
Rabat and has the honor to inform the Embassy that the 
Kingdom of Morocco has officially presented to the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights the candidacy of 
¶M. Driss Belmahi to the position of expert for the Human 
Rights Committee for the 2007-10 time frame.  The elections 
will be held on September 7, 2006 in New York, on the 
occasion of the 25th meeting of the States Parties to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
 
The Embassy will find attached the resume of M. Driss 
Belmahi.  His professional qualities and great experience 
relative to human rights make him a great candidate for the 
position. (NB: Resume faxed to NEA/MAG and not repeated here.) 
 
¶M. Belmahi is currently Chief Counselor to the Communication, 
Cooperation and Training Department of the "Diwan Al 
Madhalim" Institution (Morocco's ombudsman).  He has, among 
others, held several academic positions, and has represented 
Morocco during several international conferences and meetings 
relative to human rights. 
 
Given the excellent relations of friendship and cooperation 
between our two countries, the Moroccan Government would 
particularly appreciate the support that the Embassy of the 
United States of America would provide to this candidacy. 
 
Complimentary closing.
