¶1. (SBU) Summary:  MFA Minister delegate Taieb Fassi Fihri 
warmly welcomed the U.S.-Russian joint proposal that it host 
the first Global initiative meeting, and fully supported the 
initiative itself, but asked for a little time to respond, 
given that key decision makers are out of the country.  He 
could not get an answer before Friday.  Both Ambassadors 
stressed need for timely response.  See action request para 
¶4.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador and Russian ambassador jointly presented 
our proposal that Morocco host the first Global initiative 
meeting (reftel) to Minister-delegate Taieb Fassi Fihri 
September 13.  Russian Ambassador briefed and handed over 
points (in English) and Ambassador provided background 
material derived from reftel. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Taieb Fassi Fihri immediately responded that Morocco 
was honored by the joint proposal that it host the meeting. 
Speaking personally, he believed the Initiative was an 
important contribution and that Morocco goes all out in the 
fight against terror, it also fully supported Global 
nonproliferation efforts, citing its support of President 
Bush's Proliferation Security Initiative.  He noted that 
Morocco was on record as a full supporter of UNSC 1373.  On 
nuclear issues, however; he said Morocco is "very careful" on 
Anti-Terrorism, specifically noting only that Morocco  fully 
supports the NPT and it's protocols.  It would carefully 
examine both the meeting proposal and the substance.  He 
would not be able to give an overnight response however, due 
to the absence of the Foreign minister in Havana for the NAM, 
and other key figures.  He would seek to get us a reply as 
soon as possible, but doubted he could nail this down before 
Friday, September 15.   Both Ambassadors noted the time 
sensitivity of the request.  The Russian Ambassador stated 
that if Morocco was not able to accommodate the meeting 
another location would have to be found, so while our 
capitals would prefer a next-day response, they really needed 
to hear as soon as possible.  He promised to try to contact 
us by the end of the weekend, the US Ambassador suggested 
making the Russian Ambassador the POC. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Regarding the Declaration and Statement of 
principles, Fassi Fihri asked if the text had already been 
agreed, or would be finalized at the meeting.  we promised a 
clarification.  Please advise.  Would appreciate any other 
details we could pass to them regarding envisioned meeting, 
including size of delegations
