called to convey the news and the invitation.  He noted that

Peace Prize in 2008 and will participate in this year,s 
MEDays.  Spanish Prime Jose Luis Zapatero has confirmed that 
he will deliver the keynote address.  Bourita also emphasized

¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Although the Amadeus Institute is a think 
tank, it is headed by Foreign Minister Taieb Fassi Fihri,s 
son, Brahim.  The Ministry has used the think tank to bring 
officials here that the Government wishes to meet and does 
not wish to invite.  Senator Mitchell, I look forward to 
seeing you during the Forum for the Future and strongly urge 
you to come back to accept this invitation and prize.  Please 
advise soonest.  END COMMENT.
