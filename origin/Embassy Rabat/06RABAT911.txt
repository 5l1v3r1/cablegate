PROPOSALS 
 
REF: STATE 65746 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff discussed reftel fund on April 27 with MFA 
Director of International Organizations and UN Affairs Nasser 
Bourita.  Bourita expressed interest in the fund and said 
that it was likely that the GOM would be interested in 
participating.  He said he would review the information and 
provide a more substantive response next week. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Polcouns followed up with Bourita on May 10. 
Bourita said he sent the foreign minister a note recommending 
that Morocco provide a symbolic financial contribution to the 
fund as a sign of its support for the effort.  He understood 
there were two seats for Africa on the steering committee and 
said Morocco would probably try to lobby for one of them.  He 
promised to remain in contact as the GOM solidified its ideas 
on the fund, and to share views on how best to solicit 
interest in the fund within Moroccan civil society.
