¶1. (SBU) Summary: The Moroccan MFA passed to Embassy Rabat a 
concept paper of its planned Global Initiative to Combat 
Nuclear Terrorism conference in Rabat (June 3-5), which will 
focus on the topic of preventing illicit trafficking in 
nuclear/radioactive materials.  The Moroccan MFA wants to 
know if the USG would make a presentation at this conference 
(if so, on what topic), clarification on the appropriate 
GICNT statement of principle, and who will be leading the 
U.S. delegation to the conference. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On March 16, 2009, Moroccan Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) Security and Disarmament Chief Bouchrib Eloumi 
passed to A/Polcouns a concept paper for Morocco's hosting of 
the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) 
conference in Rabat (June 3-5) entitled "Seminar on 
Preventing Illicit Trafficking in Nuclear and Radioactive 
Materials."  The main points of this document are summarized 
in paragraph 2 below.  In a follow-up conversation with MFA 
United Nations Office Chief Azzedine Farhane on March 17, 
2009, Farhane asked Poloff if the USG could make a 
presentation at this seminar.  He also asked who would be 
leading the U.S. delegation to the seminar, adding that the 
GOM would like to see someone of equivalent rank to MFA 
Secretary General Yousef Amrani, number two in the 
MFA--Morocco's chairman for the seminar. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Summary of Moroccan GICNT Seminar Concept Paper: 
The purpose of the seminar will be to review 
trends/experiences in nuclear and radiological illicit 
trafficking, discuss techniques that can be used to prevent 
it, and to share best practices on how to respond to nuclear 
events.  The themes of the seminar include: assessing the 
phenomenon of illicit trafficking of radioactive materials; 
international instruments and initiatives to prevent it; 
establishing the capabilities to detect it; national 
experiences; and response to the detection.  Approximately 
120 experts across a range of disciplines (e.g., security, 
customs, intelligence, regulatory, and technical 
professionals) from GICNT partner countries are expected to 
participate.  In addition to Moroccan presentations, other 
GICNT participants will be invited to make presentations. 
For example, the International Atomic Energy Agency will be 
invited to make a presentation on the Illicit Trafficking 
Data Base and on its activities related to illicit 
trafficking and nuclear terrorism. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Eloumni pointed out to A/Polcouns that Morocco feels 
that the conference is more closely related to GICNT 
Statement of Principle Number 7 which reads, "improve 
capabilities of participants for response, mitigation, and 
investigation, in cases of terrorist attacks involving the 
use of nuclear and other radioactive materials and 
substances, including the development of technical means to 
identify nuclear and other radioactive materials and 
substances that are, or may be involved in the incident". 
Department information from reftel A suggested that the 
Moroccan conference was more closely related to GICNT 
Statement of Principle Number 3 and Eloumni requests 
clarification. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Post would appreciate Department guidance 
on any possible presentation the USG can provide at the Rabat 
GICNT conference, clarification on the appropriate GICNT 
statement of principle, and any information on the lead and 
makeup of the U.S. delegation for passage to the Moroccan MFA.
