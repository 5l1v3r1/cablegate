SUBJECT: MOROCCO RESPONSE: DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY FROM 
WIPO DG 
 
REF: SECSTATE 80345 
 
  ¶1. (SBU) During a June 15 meeting with Ahmed Faouzi, 
Division Chief for International Organizations at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, econoff drew from reftel 
points to urge Moroccan support of open consideration 
of the WIPO Director General issue at the Program and 
Budget Committee meeting in Geneva June 25-28, in the 
Coordination Committee, and at the WIPO General 
Assembly in September.  Faouzi was previously unaware 
of the issue and noncommittal in his remarks. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Faouzi asked if there was a plan or 
recommendation for a successor, adding that he thought 
it best to broaden the idea of resignation to include 
a recommendation for a successor.  Faouzi offered that 
the DG's Sudanese nationality was significant, in that 
it will be difficult garnishing support to remove an 
African from such a position without recommending an 
African replacement.  Faouzi closed the meeting by 
agreeing the situation was "troubling" as presented 
and pledged to share the information provided with the 
appropriate Moroccan officials.
