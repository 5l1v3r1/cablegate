TELECOMMUNICATION UNION COUNCIL 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On February 2, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
Morocco sent a diplomatic note to the Embassy seeking support 
of the United States for Morocco's candidacy for reelection 
to the Council of International Telecommunication Union 
(French original scanned and e-mailed to NEA/MAG). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Embassy's informal translation of the 
diplomatic note follows: 
 
(begin text) 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation presents its 
compliments to the Embassy of the United States of America in 
Rabat and has the honor to inform the Embassy that the 
Government of Morocco has decided to submit its candidacy for 
reelection to the Council of International Telecommunication 
Union (ITU) for the 2010-2014 term, at elections which will 
be held during the next Plenipotentiary Conference, scheduled 
for October 4-22, 2010, In Guadalajara (Mexico). 
 
Morocco, which represented the African continent within the 
ITU Council for several terms, has contributed actively to 
the development of policies and broad guidelines of the 
Union's strategy in the field of Telecommunications. 
 
Morocco is firmly committed, through audacious and innovative 
measures, to make information and communication technologies 
a tool for socio-economic development, to be able to 
contribute to the fight against poverty, illiteracy and 
disparities between regions. 
 
Thus, Morocco has implemented a series of thoughtful measures 
through liberalization of the industry of Information and 
Telecommunication Technologies, the privatization of the 
industry of Information and Telecommunication Technologies, 
the privatization of public institutions operating in the 
sector and the creation of independent structures of 
regulations. 
 
In this regard, the Kingdom of Morocco is fully engaged in 
the process of consolidation of a global cooperation in the 
fields of training, safety and technology development, and 
works for the exchange of information and the transfer of 
know-how. 
 
In view of excellent relations of friendship and cooperation 
existing between our two countries, the Government of Morocco 
would highly appreciate the valuable support by the 
Government of the United States of America to the Moroccan 
candidacy. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the 
Kingdom of Morocco avails itself of this opportunity to renew 
to the Embassy of the United States of America in Rabat the 
assurances of its highest consideration.
