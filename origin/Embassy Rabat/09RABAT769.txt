¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Top USG officials have been invited to 
take part in the annual "MEDays 2009" forum, November 19 to

The event is being organized by the Amadeus Institute, a 
Moroccan think tank with ties to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Cooperation (MFA), under the banner "Forum of the 
South for a New Mediterranean."  Post encourages senior USG 
participation in this event, as it would promote dialogue 
with political decision makers, the private sector and civil 
society for regional political, economic and social 
integration of the Mediterranean area.  End Summary.

HIGH LEVEL USG OFFICIALS INVITED 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Building on the success of the first "MEDays" forum 
held November 2008 in Tangier, which called for urgent action 
to re-open borders between Morocco and Algeria and the 
"effective and sustainable revival of the Arab Maghreb 
Union," the Amadeus Institute has broadened the scope of this 
year's event.  This year's "MEDays" forum is also set to take 
place in Tangier from November 19 to 21 and bring together 
top economic, political and civil society leaders.  The goal 
of this edition, Institute President Brahim Fassi Fihri 
informed CDA at a recent meeting, is to come together to 
propose concrete recommendations for development in Africa 
and the Mediterranean through "North-South" cooperation.  The 
event will cover geopolitical themes such as crisis 
resolution and human development in Africa, a comprehensive 
analysis of the Mediterranean Union and security issues in 
the Western Mediterranean.  Invitations have been extended to 
leaders from Tony Blair to Desmond Tutu.  Spanish Prime 
Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spanish Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Miguel Angel Moratinos, and Zimbabwean Prime 
Minister Morgan Tsvangirai have already accepted their 
invitations, with Zapatero scheduled as the keynote speaker. 
 
The following is a list of USG officals and other notable 
Americans who have been invited to take part in the forum: 
 
USG Officials: 
 
-- George Mitchell, Special Envoy to the Middle East 
-- Donald Payne, Congressman, Chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Africa and Global Health 
-- Alonzo Fulgham, Acting USAID Administrator 
-- Brad Sherman, Congressman, Chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade 
-- William Burns, Under Secretary of State for Political 
Affairs 
-- Joseph McMillan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense of 
International Security Affairs 
 
Other Americans:

-- Lynn Pascoe, Under Secretary General of the United Nations

A "YOUNG" THINK TANK 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The organizer of the event, the Amadeus Institute, 
is a self-proclaimed "young" think tank composed of a small 
team of Moroccan and international professionals led by the 
son of Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs Taieb Fassi 
Fihri.  "Our ambition is to draw inspiration from researchers 
and experts, but also from the new vision of the young and 
active members of the Institute," stressed the younger Fassi 
Fihri.  The Institute is the offspring of a student 
organization by the same name that united Moroccan students 
studying at colleges and universities overseas.  They came 
together upon returning home to fill the independent "think 
tank" void in Morocco and contribute to the economic, social 
and cultural development of the region, noted the Institute's 
Vice President of Public Affairs Mekki Lahlou. 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Amadeus Institute's main objective is to 
promote debate and inform civil societies by enabling more 
interaction between governments, businesses, civil societies, 
universities, researchers and future decision makers.  At the 
same time, the Institute seeks to produce concrete and 
operational recommendations on strategic issues with a 
Moroccan, North African and South-Mediterranean vision.  In 
addition to planning events like the MEDays forums, the group 
has created a center for analysis and publications to 
generate ideas and debates to guide decsion makers.  Due to 
funding issues, noted Lahlou, the Institute has focused more 
on planning events that are supported by Moroccan and French 
companies.  One of their main contributors is the Moroccan 
Phosphate Company, Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP). 
The Institute is open to any and all support the U.S. Embassy 
could offer, Fassi Fihri told the CDA.  The CDA mentioned the 
possibility of small grants, and promised to be in touch 
after further consultations with the country team.

OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE 
--------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  The first MEDays Forum in 2008 brought 
together over 500 participants and 100 high level speakers 
from the Mediterranean, Africa and North America to engage in 
a dialogue to shape a new development vision for the 
Mediterranean.  It also represented one of the rare recent 
encounters between prominent Israelis and Arabs.  This year's 
event will be just as ambitious and promises to have a 
similar turnout.  USG representation at this event would 
signal our commitment to continued discussions on integration 
efforts for the region.  End Comment.
