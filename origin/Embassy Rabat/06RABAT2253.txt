¶1.  This cable is sensitive but unclassified, please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (U)  On December 8, the families of 350 Islamist 
prisoners staged a demonstration in front of the Consultative 
Council for Human Rights (CCDH) offices in Rabat.  The 
demonstration was organized by the Annasir ("helper") 
organization which works with the families and had attempted 
to have the prisoners' cases reviewed by the Ministry of 
Justice.  The families demanded that the prisoners be 
"re-tried" or released from prison.  CCDH, a 
royally-appoited body with a fair degree of influence, was 
then having one of its periodic board meetings, so it is 
possible the protest could have been heard by council 
members.  Some of the prisoners are on hunger strike and all 
say that their families are suffering because of their 
incarceration.  Approximately 370 Islamists are held under 
the 2003 anti-terrorism law.  They are imprisoned in eleven 
different prisons.  Police stood on the outskirts but did not 
interfere. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Poloff observed this demonstration.  Approximately 
one hundred women and some children participated.  The 
participants grouped themselves on the steps of the CCDH 
building; some of the participants carried signs and many had 
pictures of the prisoners. 
The women chanted: "God is great; God is merciful."  The 
demonstration created little interest for passers-by. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  All of the women were dressed conservatively with 
scarves and long robes ("thobes"); several of the women were 
veiled ("naqab") and many others were dressed in black 
"abbayas" (outer cloaks), scarves, veils and gloves.  With 
many women completely covered, it was clear that the women 
adhered to a strict, fundamentalist interpretation of Islam.
