Â¶1. (SBU) POLOFF MET WITH HASSAN HAMI, OFFICE DIRECTOR FOR ARAB 
AND ISLAMIC AFFAIRS AT THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ON 
NOVEMBER 21 TO URGE THAT MOROCCO NOT SEND ITS AMBASSADOR TO 
THE NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATION HOSTED BY PRESIDENT LAHOUD AND 
URGED THAT MOROCCO ESCHEW THE EVENT ALTOGETHER IF PRIME 
MINISTER SENIORA IS NOT ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EVENT 
(REFTEL).  HAMI PROMISED TO CONVEY THE U.S. MESSAGE TO THE 
MINISTER'S OFFICE, WHICH WOULD HAVE TO APPROVE ANY SUCH 
INSTRUCTION TO MOROCCO'S EMBASSY IN BEIRUT.  OFFERING A 
PERSONAL OPINION, HAMI THOUGHT MOROCCOS AMBASSADOR "WOULD BE 
HARD-PRESSED TO TURN DOWN A DIRECT INVITATION FROM THE 
PRESIDENT" FOR THIS EVENT IN THE ABSENCE OF CONSENSUS AMONG 
ARAB STATES ON SUCH AN ACTION.
