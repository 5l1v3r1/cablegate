REF: SECSTATE 190899 
 
¶1. (U) Per reftel, talking points were delivered to Dr. 
Abderraham Benmamoun, Chief of Infectious Diseases, Ministry 
of Health, on November 30.  Benmamoun was well briefed on the 
Bamako Avian Flu conference and said he would lead the 
Moroccan delegation, which would also include Dr. Abderrahman 
Labrak, Chief of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture. 
 
¶2. (SBU) When asked about the potential attendance of a 
delegation from the Arab Sahrawis Democratic Republic (RASD - 
The Polisario), Benmamoun presented an MFA memo dated 
November 28.  The memo stated the Moroccan Ambassador to Mali 
did not think the Polisario would be invited, but 
nonetheless, left open the possibility of last minute 
Polisario attendance.  Pointing to the memo, Benmamoun 
reiterated that he intended to lead a technical delegation to 
the conference, but the issue of simultaneous Polisario and 
Moroccan attendance was political and beyond his authority. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  Although the memo we saw did not 
specifically direct the Moroccan delegation to boycott any 
meeting where Polisario were present, we assess Moroccan 
participation alongside Polisario representatives as very 
doubtful.  End Comment.
