SUBJECT: QADHAFI'S ROAD TRIP THROUGH GUINEA 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Libyan leader Mu'ammar Qadhafi's road 
trip to the AU Summit in Accra brought him through Guinea for 
48 hours.  Guineans celebrated Qadhafi's visit with a 
national holiday as they looked forward to new promises of 
aid for Guinea, which Qadhafi gave.  On its side of the 
promise, Guinea announced its support for Qadhafi's United 
States of Africa.  Guinea's cabinet came out with a strong 
show of support for the Libyan delegation, accompanying them, 
by road, across the country.  To the Guinean military, the 
visit was seen as a victory for the hale and hearty Prime 
Minister over the infirm Conte.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  (U) On June 24, Libyan leader Mu'ammar Qadhafi arrived in 
Conakry to pay a visit to Guinean President Lansana Conte, as 
part of his road trip to the AU summit in Accra.  However, 
the visit turned out to be more of a showcase for Prime 
Minister Kouyate and his cabinet than Conte.  Qadhafi was 
welcomed at the Malian border by Kouyate and several of his 
ministers and then drove to Conakry, where he was welcomed by 
President Conte.  In honor of the visit, Monday was declared 
a holiday, "Qadhafi Day," so that everyone could attend a 
rally/speech at the national stadium in Conakry. 
 
¶3.  (U) At the rally, Kouyate pledged his (and Conte's) 
support for Qadhafi's "United States of Africa," which the 
Libyans are pushing while making their way to the Summit. 
Kouyate stated that Guinea would be willing to give up some 
sovereignty in favor of integration into the proposed U.S. of 
Africa.  As for Qadhafi, while his speech sounded the now 
familiar theme of support for African integration, he also 
blamed the ills of the continent on others.  The Libyan 
leader did offer new promises of aid to Guinea. 
 
¶4.  (U) Qadhafi promised several hundred thousand dollars in 
aid for projects in the energy sector, the construction of 
housing, and support for agricultural development projects in 
Guinea.  He also promised to help with restoration of a 
pineapple factory project in Salguidia, new uniforms for the 
military, as well as cooperation between their Central Banks 
to help stabilize the Guinea Franc. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) COMMENT.  This visit was Kouyate's second Libyan 
connection in the last few weeks.  Earlier this month, 
Kouyate stopped in Libya just before beginning his U.S. 
visit.  Military sources report that Guinean soldiers saw the 
visit as a victory for Kouyate.  Kouyate enjoyed significant 
face time with the Libyan leader and widespread press 
coverage.  During Qadhafi's visit with Conte, the Guinean 
President could only stand for 3 or 4 seconds during the 
meeting before collapsing back into his chair.  Qadhafi's 
visit was his first to this part of Africa in a long time. 
His speech did not reveal anything new, and it remains to be 
seen if Qadhafi will deliver on his promises.  Many Guineans 
expressed some doubt about real support for Guinea, instead 
seeing the trip as more of a PR event for an ideology of the 
past, a notion no doubt reinforced when Qadhafi referred to 
Guinea using the name the country went by during Sekou Toure 
era.  We will continue to follow the relationship between 
Kouyate and Qadhafi.  In his outreach to non-traditional 
partners, Kouyate seems determined to get help any way he 
can.  END COMMENT.
