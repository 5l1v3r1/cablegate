SUBJECT: AUSTRALIA EXPLORING ADDITIONAL STEPS IN RESPONSE 
TO IRAN'S URANIUM ENRICHMENT PROGRAM

¶1. (U) In remarks to the Australian Parliament September 17 
that were picked up by local media, Foreign Minister Stephen 
Smith said Australia was considering additional measures it 
might take within the international community to respond to 
Iran's failure to halt its uranium enrichment program.  Smith 
noted the September 15 report of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency confirmed Iran was continuing its uranium 
enrichment and reprocessing activities in defiance of four 
legally-binding UN Security Council resolutions.  He charged 
Iran with failing to give the IAEA needed access to assess 
the nature of Iran's nulear activities and remove justifiable 
doubts of the international community regarding Iran's 
intentions.  Smith voiced support for the efforts of the 
permanent members of the UNSC and Germany to engage 
constructively with Iran, including their offer of a generous 
incentive package, and welcomed the EU's June 23 travel and 
financial sanctions. 
 
¶2. (U) Excerpts from FM Smith's statement follow: 
 
I am deeply concerned by a report released by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 15 September 
that confirms Iran is persisting with its uranium enrichment 
and reprocessing-related activities in violation of four 
legally binding UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. 
 
It shows that Iran has, yet again, failed to provide the IAEA 
with the access it needs to give credible assurances about 
the nature of Iran's nuclear program. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the IAEA has comprehensive and detailed 
information which suggests that Iran has conducted studies 
into nuclear weapons and military involvement in nuclear 
procurement. 
 
Iran continues to dismiss this information as "forged and 
fabricated" and to hinder the IAEA's investigation into these 
issues. 
 
These actions are not those of a state seeking to address the 
international community's concerns about the nature of its 
nuclear program. 
 
Iran needs to comply immediately with its obligations and 
suspend its uranium enrichment and reprocessing-related 
activities. 
 
It must grant the IAEA the access it needs to remove the 
international community's justifiable doubts about Iran's 
peaceful intentions. 
 
Australia supports the efforts of the permanent members of 
the UNSC (and) Germany to engage constructively with Iran, 
and the generous incentives package they have offered Iran 
should it suspend its enrichment activities. 
 
It is in Iran's interests to accept the incentives package, 
which represents the best way to resolve the nuclear issue to 
the benefit of all. 
 
Iran has a clear choice: cooperation or face further 
isolation from the international community 
 
Australia has made a firm commitment against the spread of 
nuclear weapons.  We strongly support, and have implemented 
fully, UNSC sanctions against Iran, which target Iran's 
proliferation sensitive nuclear activities. 
 
Australian has implemented into law these sanctions, 
including financial and travel restrictions, as well as a 
prohibition on the supply of specific goods, services and 
financing which could assist Iran's nuclear and missile 
programs. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we welcomed European Union agreement on 23 June 
to new travel and financial sanctions aimed at pressuring 
Qto new travel and financial sanctions aimed at pressuring 
Iran to halt uranium enrichment. 
 
In light of Iran's continuing failure to comply with its 
international obligations, the Government is considering what 
further measures it can take with the international community 
to bring further pressure to bear on Iran.
