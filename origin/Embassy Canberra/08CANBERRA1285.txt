REF: SARRANO-KAGAN EMAIL 12/17/2008 
 
¶1. (SBU) Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
confirmed to Embassy December 17 that the GOA has announced 
it will extend sanctions against 75 more supporters of the 
Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe, and against four extra companies. 
DFAT Director for Sanctions and Transnational Crimes Peter 
Scott told econoff this move was to reflect changes since 
Zimbabwe's recent elections; he noted that a half-dozen 
individuals would actually come off the list. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The travel restrictions will take effect almost 
immediately; DFAT will pass the names to Australian 
immigration officials for inclusion on their list.  The 
extension of financial sanctions to these additional 
individuals/companies DFAT hopes to have concluded before 
Christmas; if not, it will slip to early January.  Scott also 
said the GOA was going to impose additional controls on 
public support of trade with Zimbabwe, probably with an 
announcement before Christmas.
