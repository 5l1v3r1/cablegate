SUBJECT: AUSTRALIANS RESPOND TO US READ-OUT ON US-RUSSIA 
PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT 
 
REF: (A) CANBERRA 642 (B) STATE 71326 
 
¶1. (SBU) In response to our earlier demarche (ref A) on the 
outcome of the U.S.-Russia Presidential Summit, Michael 
O'Bryne, Executive Officer, Northern, Central and Eastern 
Europe Section told the Embassy on July 14 that the GOA's 
overall response is positive.  O'Bryne expressed pleasure 
that the United States and Russia have agreed to continue 
work on a follow-on agreement to the START treaty.  He asked 
if there was a sense that Russia now felt the need to 
reciprocate the "big gesture" that the U.S. has made in the 
course of this summit. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: The Australians are very interested in the 
follow-ons from the Summit. Moore asked specifically if there 
was an active time table for the Bilateral Presidential 
Commission.
