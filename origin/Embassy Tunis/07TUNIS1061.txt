SUBJECT: SUPPORTING TUNISIA'S COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORT: A 
1206 PROPOSAL 
 
REF: STATE 84130 
 
(SBU) As requested in reftel, Embassy Tunis submitted a 
FY-2008 Section 1206 proposal by email to NEA/MAG on July 31. 
 The proposal, titled "Suppressing Trans-Border Terrorist 
Activity," seeks to provide $35 million in immediate 
assistance to the Tunisian Armed Forces, which is undertaking 
new and expanded counterterrorism activities on Tunisia's 
borders to combat the spread of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic 
Maghreb.  Specifically, the proposal seeks to respond to the 
Tunisian military's need for increased helicopter flight 
hours, night vision goggles and ground surveillance radar -- 
all of which will be dedicated to counterterrorism 
activities.  I urge the Department to support this proposal 
and back the Tunisian government's efforts to combat 
transnational terrorist activities.
