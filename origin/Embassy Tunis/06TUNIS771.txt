¶1. (SBU) On March 27, Poloff met with Ahlem Belhadj and 
Hafidha Checkir of the Tunisian Association of Democratic 
Women (ATFD) to discuss their 2002 report on child sexual 
exploitation, titled "A Situational Analysis of Commercial 
Sexual Exploitation of Children in Tunisia."  (NOTE: This 
report includes official statistics from a 2001 GOT report on 
the state of children and unofficial analysis of child sexual 
exploitation and can be found at: 
www.ecpatinternational.org/eng/Ecpat inter/ 
projects/monitoring/rabat/tunisia.pdf. END NOTE.)  Checkir 
explained that Tunisian laws related to trafficking in 
persons (TIP) and child sexual exploitation are appropriate 
and adequate.  However, comprehensive application of these 
laws is sometime limited by overlapping responsibilities 
among GOT ministries, lack of resources and cultural 
sensitivities. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Belhadj said that many different GOT ministries and 
departments are involved in combating child sexual 
exploitation, providing shelter and counseling for victims, 
and investigating allegations; therefore sometimes 
coordination was an issue.  Since children's issues were 
moved to the Ministry of Women's Affairs, Family, Children 
and Senior Citizens (MWAFCSC), some of these problems have 
lessened.  However, Belhadj said it is unclear to what 
extent, as government statistics have limited distribution. 
Therefore, they had no new information or details to add to 
their report, which was completed in 2002. 
 
¶3. (SBU) When asked if GOT limitations in this area were due 
to resources or mentality, Belhadj said both are a problem. 
The GOT has established a High Commission for the Protection 
of Children under the MWAFCSC, which has a representative in 
each of Tunisia's governorates.  However, Belhadj said these 
representatives often lack the staff and material resources 
to effectively investigate reported abuses, including 
vehicles to travel outside of major cities.  Additionally, 
abuse cases may spend years in the legal system, due to the 
complex and time-intensive nature of the Tunisian legal 
system. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Regarding medical care and counseling for victims, 
Belhadj and Checkir noted that cultural stereotypes about 
mental health treatment make victims and their families 
reluctant to utilize such services.  Also, the field of child 
psychology is new in Tunisia and only ten doctors nationwide 
have appropriate expertise.  They said that both citizens and 
the GOT consider psychological care or counseling to be a 
luxury, and GOT efforts in the medical field are currently 
focused on providing basic health care to all citizens. 
 
¶5. (U) Post has also requested a meeting with the Ministry of 
Women's Affairs, Family, Children and Senior Citizens to 
obtain more detail on GOT efforts and any available 
statistical data.
