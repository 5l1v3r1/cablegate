Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Official and unofficial Tunisian reactions to the 
award of the Nobel Peace Prize to President Obama reflected 
in varying levels surprise, satisfaction, and hints of 
indignation, with some commentary strongly questioning the 
award as preliminary.  A senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
official told the Ambassador on October 13 that the prize was 
well deserved and "an inspiration for all of us." 
 
¶2. (SBU) An editorial in the government controlled press said 
the Nobel Committee had rewarded the President for his 
intentions rather than his deeds.  Reactions from the public, 
posted on the Embassy's Facebook page, were mostly 
congratulatory but a number also urged the President to 
"bring peace and justice to Palestine."  End summary.

Official and Semi-official Reactions 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) The official Tunisian reaction to the decision to 
award President Obama the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize was highly 
laudatory.  President Ben Ali congratulated President Obama 
in a public message that was prominently covered in the 
government controlled press.  Saida Chtoui, Secretary of 
State for Asia and the Americas, told the Ambassador on 
October 13 that the award was well deserved and an 
inspiration for all Tunisians.  The Arabic language As Sabah 
October 13 editorial's headline read, "Yes You Can, Mr. 
President."  The editorial said the "inscrutable" Nobel 
Committee had for the first time rewarded a man for his 
intentions rather than his deeds.  But the article went on to 
praise President Obama for his courage in moving to dismantle 
Guantanamo, committing to a withdrawal from Iraq, stretching 
a hand out to Iran, and "resisting the Zionist lobby." 
Another, more popular, Arabic tabloid paper ran an oversized 
headline saying, "The Cart before the Horse!!"  It was 
subtitled, "The Committee rewards Obama while there is no 
peace."  There was also broad coverage in Tunisian newspapers 
of international reactions to the reward. 
 
----------------- 
Private Reactions 
----------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Private reactions were more muted.  Several contacts 
told us that they were pleased President Obama had won but 
now the onus was on him to deliver results.  Public reactions 
published on the Embassy's Facebook site ranged from 
enthusiastic, "he deserves the best," and "he has to go ahead 
and give the world some peace," to the slightly sarcastic, 
"no one else out there?  Oh well, he deserves it."  A number 
of those who posted also hoped the prize would spur the 
President to "bring justice to Palestine," or variants of 
this theme.

¶4. (SBU) The general reaction in Tunis is the same as the 
reaction to the President's Cairo speech: Tunisians are happy 
for the change President Obama has brought to America's 
public tone and are glad to cheer him on, but they are still 
waiting for concrete results.  End Comment.
