¶1. Embassy Tunis provides the following narrative in response 
to reftel request. 
 
¶2. The Government of Tunisia's national budget is publicly 
available and is published in the official gazette and on the 
internet.  According to Tunisian law, the parliamentary 
debates on the annual budget are open to the public.  The 
Tunisian Court of Accountability -- the Tunisian counterpart 
to the US Government Accounting Office -- monitors and 
investigates the use of GOT funds. 
 
Tunisia's ranking on Transparency International's (TI) 
Corruption Index has dropped from 43 in 2005 to 61 (out of 
179 countries) in 2007 with a score of 4.2.  According to the 
TI Corruption Index scale, a score of ten indicates extremely 
little corruption and a score of zero very serious 
corruption.  There is no single GOT ministry or agency with 
combatting corruption as a specific mandate, although the 
Court of Accountability may investigate allegations of 
corruption through the course of their normal reviews. 
 
The US Embassy promotes good governance and transparency 
through visiting speakers, training and exchange programs in 
the United States, and through government-to-government 
technical assistance programs under the auspices of the 
Middle East Partnership Initiative and the Commercial Law 
Development Program.  The Government of Tunisia is also 
implementing good governance programs with the United Nations 
Development Program and European Union member countries.  The 
most recent IMF review of compliance with standards and codes 
governing fiscal transparency was conducted in 2002.
