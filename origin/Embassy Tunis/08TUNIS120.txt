¶1.  Summary: Embassy Tunis is pleased to submit a proposal to 
further the advancement of agricultural biotechnology (agbiotech) 
research and awareness in Tunisia.  The GOT is currently drafting 
regulations on biotechnology and we would like them to be 
trade-friendly.  Given that the European Union is Tunisia's largest 
trade partner, representing nearly 80 percent of Tunisia's total 
trade, exposure to US experts and researchers is critical to 
encouraging support for and research in the field of agricultural 
biotechnology.  The proposed visit of three US biotechnology 
researchers builds on the successful 2007 EEB-sponsored visit of Dr. 
Foster Agblevor and has the potential to lead to increased 
US-Tunisian research collaboration in agricultural biotechnology. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. Embassy Tunis proposes supporting the visit of three US 
researchers to an international symposium on biotechnology scheduled 
to take place May 4-8, 2008 at the Center for Biotechnology of Sfax 
(CBS)(a virtual visit of the center is available at 
http://www.cbs.rnrt.tn).  This event will coincide with the 25th 
anniversary of the CBS and will bring prominent biotech researchers 
from several countries, including France, to interact with their 
Tunisian counterparts.  The overarching goal is to promote the use 
of biotechnologies in Tunisia.  The program (available at 
http://isb2008.cbstunisia.com) features a series of lectures and 
workshops dealing with three different themes: (1) Biotechnology for 
human health; (2) microbial and environmental biotech; and (3) 
agricultural, food and marine biotechnology. 
 
¶3. USDA/FAS has carried out several activities in Tunisia aimed at 
building close relationships with key players and on advocating a 
trade-friendly stance with regard to GMOs. We have been successful 
so far, as US-origin shipments of corn and soybean meal, widely 
believed to contain various proportions of bio-engineered material, 
continue to enjoy unfettered access to the market.  However, 
Tunisia's proximity to Europe, notoriously unfriendly towards 
biotech products, and its proclivity to a European way of thinking 
in general, suggest that we must continue to be vigilant in this 
arena.  Whereas the so-called non-GMO biotechnologies are widely 
accepted, GMOs are controversial. 
 
¶4. In support of Embassy Tunis' joint efforts, CBS would like to 
invite the following US researchers to present the indicated topics 
at the symposium: 
 
¶A. Berkowitz Gerald A., University of Connecticut, "Mechanisms 
mediating Ca2+ involvement in pathogen perception, programmed cell 
death and plant innate immunity" 
 
¶B. Federici Brian A., University of California, 
"Basic Biology and Genetic Engineering of Bacillus thuringiensis" 
 
¶C. Potts Malcolm, Virginia Tech University and Qatar University 
"Roof Biofilm: A Unique Biotechnological Resource" 
 
We would also like to program these individuals with an appropriate 
group of university students during one of the conference days. 
 
¶5. Fostering interactions between US and Tunisian scientists lays 
the groundwork for a meaningful dialogue on the benefits stemming 
from the wide embrace of agricultural biotechnology.  Tunisian 
researchers who have participated in several USDA/FAS-supported 
joint US-Tunisia agricultural research projects tend to be biotech 
proponents.  Gaining allies among researchers could prove to be 
useful in fulfilling USG biotech strategy as scientists play a key 
role in the policymaking on this issue in Tunisia.  The head of CBS, 
for instance, is a key member of the National Biosafety Committee, 
an institution in charge of shaping the future of biotech in this 
country. 
 
¶6. Dr. Foster Agblevor from Virginia Tech University recently 
visited CBS as part of Embassy Tunis' EEB-sponsored agbiotech 
outreach.  Dr. Agblevor concluded that the institution is too 
reliant on collaborative research with French institutions focusing 
on basic research with few, if any, prospects of tangible outcomes 
to farmers and other potential end-users.  He also noted the 
existence of a lot of skepticism about the merits of agricultural 
biotechnologies among the CBS researchers.  Dr. Agblevor concluded, 
and the Embassy concurs, that establishing more linkages with US 
universities will be vital to winning over the skeptics and 
re-orienting the CBS work towards practical applications.  The 
active involvement of prominent US researchers at this high-profile 
event, alongside their French counterparts, will be an excellent 
milestone to this end. 
¶7. PROGRAM COST 
 
- Round-trip Airfare-(est.) 
$1,500 X 2 (for east coast speakers) + $2,500 (for west coast 
speaker) = $5,500 
 
- Honorarium--$200/program X 1 day = $200/person = $600 
 
- Per Diem (lodging and M&IE): covered by CBS 
 
Total = $6,161
