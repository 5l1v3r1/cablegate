¶B. 06 TUNIS 2753 
 
¶1. (U) This cable contains highlights of recent economic 
developments in Tunisia on the following topics: 
 
¶A. IMF Concludes 2007 Article IV Mission 
¶B. Qatar Petroleum Awarded Skhira Refinery Tender 
 
-------------------------------- 
IMF Concludes Article IV Mission 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Following the Article IV consultations in Tunisia, the IMF 
released a statement praising the GOT's efficient management of the 
economy, strong growth, and macroeconomic stability. The IMF noted 
that the banking sector has improved noticeably in the past three 
years with the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) declining from 24 
percent of total loans in 2003 to 19.2 percent in 2006.  While 
praising Tunisia's solid economic performance, the IMF emphasized 
that unemployment remains relatively high (13.9 percent), especially 
among university graduates.  The IMF recommended strengthening 
Tunisia's macroeconomic position, continuing liberalization, 
stimulating private investment, and pursuing reform of the education 
and training systems.  The final report will be released in July. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: The IMF recommendations are unlikely to differ 
from those issued by Deputy Managing Director Murilo Portugal at the 
conclusion of his visit in April (Ref A).  Many of the reforms urged 
by the IMF, such as liberalization of the capital account and the 
reduction of NPLs, are already on the GOT agenda; the 
recommendations are unlikely to push the timeline for economic 
reform ahead of the current GOT schedule.  End Comment.

Qatar Petroleum Awarded Skhira Refinery Tender 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4. (U) On May 26, Qatari Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for 
Energy and Industry, and Chairman of Qatar Petroleum (QP), Abdullah 
Bin Hamad Al-Attiya, and the Tunisian Minister for Industry, Energy, 
and Small and Medium Enterprise, Afif Chelbi, signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding awarding the Skhira refinery tender to state-owned 
Qatar Petroleum.  The tender, estimated to be US $2 billion 
investment, is a 30-year build, own, and operate project.  The 
Skhira oil refinery will be located in the Gulf of Gabes on the 
eastern coast of Tunisia.  The refinery will have a capacity of 
about 120,000 to 150,000 barrels per day and is expected to be 
completed in 2011. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT AND BACKGROUND: With the Skhira refinery, Tunisia 
aims to boost Tunisia's refinery capacity to meet the growing demand 
for oil products.  Currently, Tunisia has only one refinery located 
in Bizerte, with a daily capacity of 30,000 barrels.  The new 
refinery would give Tunisia the capacity to refine all domestic 
crude oil production.  According to ETAP, Tunisia's state-owned oil 
company, Tunisia produces on average about 112,000 barrels of crude 
oil per day.  QP's investment follows Qatar Telecom's foray into the 
Tunisian market (Ref A) and reflects the growth of Qatari and Gulf 
(Ref B) investment in Tunisia.  END COMMENT AND BACKGROUND.
