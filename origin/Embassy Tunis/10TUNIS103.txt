Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a February 4 courtesy call, the Ambassador 
discussed Tunisia's tourism sector with Minister of Tourism 
Slim Tlatli.  Tlatli reported that the Government of Tunisia 
(GOT) intends to sign an Open Skies agreement with the United 
States by November 2011.  The Ambassador and the Minister 
also discussed other ways of increasing U.S.-Tunisia links, 
including the "Memphis in May" festival and the U.S.-Tunisia 
match-up at the September World Championship games of the 
International Basketball Federation.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Plans to Develop the Tourism Sector 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Tlatli opened the meeting with an overview of the 
tourism sector, which represents six percent of GDP and 
directly employs over 4,000 Tunisians, and outlined the 
ministry's plans to expand the sector with desert tours, golf 
courses, thalasso (salt water) therapy, cultural tours, and 
eco-tourism.  His ministry is pursuing a strategy to 
diversify the tourism sector and increase its profitability 
by expanding into the high-end market. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
A November 2011 Deadline for Open Skies 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Following discussions with ministers of transport 
(ref A), development (ref B), and finance (ref C), the 
Ambassador raised the possibility of an Open Skies agreement 
with Tunisia to expand trade and to move beyond the current, 
relatively low, annual level of 20,000 U.S. visitors.  Tlatli 
said that the GOT had set an internal deadline of November 
2011 to sign several aviation agreements, including an Open 
Skies agreement with the United States.  (Note:  As reported 
in ref D, the Embassy sent a model text of an Open Skies 
agreement to the GOT in September 2009.  End note.)  Tlatli 
also said that Tunisia's national carrier, Tunisair, was 
negotiating a codeshare agreement with Delta Airlines; he 
said that Delta appeared reluctant to accept a codeshare with 
Tunisair, preferring to partner with European airlines. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Opportunities for U.S.-Tunisia Cooperation 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Ambassador and the minister discussed other 
opportunities to increase U.S.-Tunisia trade and tourism 
links, including the "Memphis in May International Festival," 
which will host a "salute to Tunisia" this year.  Tlatli also 
said that his brother, Adel Tlatli, is the head coach of the 
Tunisian national basketball team, which will face the U.S. 
team in Istanbul, Turkey on September 2 at the International 
Basketball Federation World Championship.  Tlatli said that 
some 17 million U.S. viewers are expected to watch the game 
on television, and he asked the Ambassador to assist the 
ministry's request for free airtime for a commercial 
promoting tourism in Tunisia. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Updated biographic information on Minister Tlatli 
has been sent to INR/B via email.
