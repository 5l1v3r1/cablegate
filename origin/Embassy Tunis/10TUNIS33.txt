SUBJECT: TUNISIA:  CLIMATE CHANGE NEXT STEPS 
 
REF: STATE 3080 
 
On January 15, ECON/ESTH Officer delivered the points on the 
need to endorse the Copenhagen Accord (reftel) to Tunisian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs officers Hatem Landoulsi and 
Mourad Belhassan.  ECON/ESTH Officer flagged the January 31 
response deadline and urged Tunisia to promptly associate 
itself with the Copenhagen Accord.  While they believed the 
MFA could move on its own to respond to the question of 
associating Tunisia with the Accord, Landoulsi and Belhassan 
said that a response on Tunisia's climate change targets and 
actions would require significant inter-agency coordination 
and doubted they could achieve this before January 31.
