SUBJECT: MGGZ01: TUNISIA CALLS FOR RESUMPTION OF DIALOGUE 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 29, Tunisia released an official statement 
related to the latest Israeli-Palestinian developments, 
reiterating its call for "resumption of dialogue and 
implementation of the Roadmap."  Also on June 29, in a speech 
to newly arrived ambassadors, President Ben Ali stressed the 
need for "international protection" for the Palestinian 
people and the importance of resuming negotiations.  Both the 
statement and the speech reflected Tunisia's traditional 
moderate stance on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, while 
reiterating its support for the Palestinian people. 
 
¶2. (U) Below is the full text of the official public 
statement (TAP Translation): 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
Tunisia reiterates its call for resumption of dialogue and 
implementation of "Roadmap" 
 
TUNIS, June 29 (TAP) - Tunisia is following, with great 
concern, developments in the occupied Palestinian 
territories, and the painful conditions the brotherly 
Palestinian people are subjected to, and the degradation of 
the situation in the region, as a result of Israel's 
obstinacy to escalate its attacks against a defenseless 
people, imposing on it a stifling blockade and destroying its 
infrastructures and belongings. 
 
Tunisia, which hosted the Palestinian Revolution, offered its 
leadership the ideal framework in which it carried out its 
action in all freedom, opened to the Palestinians the ways 
for weaving tight and robust ties with the European capitals, 
and helped them launch dialogue with the United States of 
America, which made possible the Palestinian leadership's 
return to Palestine. 
 
Tunisia has unfailingly supported the Palestinian cause and 
reasserted its active solidarity with the Palestinian people 
in their fight for recovering their robbed lands and their 
right to self-determination and the edification of an 
independent state on their soil. 
 
Given its conviction that dialogue and political solutions 
are the surest way and the most efficient tool to achieve a 
just, comprehensive and sustainable settlement, Tunisia has 
expended huge efforts and is incessantly endeavoring to urge 
the international community to take a firm stand to put an 
end to the Israeli government's violations and compel it to 
abide by the international legality and to be serious and 
responsible in dealing with all initiatives and efforts meant 
to revive the peace process. 
 
Today more than ever before, Tunisia reaffirms the need to 
provide international protection to the Palestinian people, 
as part of the respect of international law, the United 
Nations legitimacy and the relevant Security Council 
resolutions. 
 
It reiterates its call to all influential sides, particularly 
members of the Quartet, to act for the resumption of dialogue 
and the implementation of the "Roadmap," with a view to 
reaching a fair, comprehensive and lasting peace in the 
Middle East region and to help all the region's peoples live 
in security and stability, and devote themselves to the tasks 
of building and reconstruction.
