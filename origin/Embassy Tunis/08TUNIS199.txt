¶1. (U) This cable contains highlights of recent economic 
developments in Tunisia on the following topics: 
 
¶A. Growing Inflationary Pressures on Tunisia's Economy 
¶B. Tunisia Posts Record US $1.6 billion FDI 
¶C. GOT Allocates US $802.94 million for Subsidies 
¶D. Tunisia, Morocco Strengthen Economic Cooperation

Growing Inflationary Pressures on Tunisia's Economy 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2. (U) According to the latest Tunisian National Institute of 
Statistics (INS), Tunisia's consumer price inflation, for January, 
rose to 5.7 percent year-on-year compared to 5.3 percent in December 
¶2007.  The January increase was due mainly to 9 percent growth in 
food costs because of higher prices of imported commodities. 
Sizable flows of foreign direct investment (FDI, see para 4), and 
the depreciation of the dinar relative to the Euro may also have 
contributed to inflation, according to the IMF. 
 
¶3. (U) The IMF January's Article IV report predicted that 
inflationary pressures, particularly imported inflation, would be 
likely to continue in 2008.  However, the Tunisian Central Bank's 
cautious monetary policy, and increase of required reserves ratios, 
is expected to keep inflation down to 4 percent on average in 2008. 
This forecast takes into account likely increases in the price of 
"administered products" (e.g., oil) if world commodity prices remain 
high.

Tunisia Posts Record US $1.6 billion FDI 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) During a February 9 press conference, Noureddine Zekri, 
Director General of Foreign Investment at the Ministry of 
Development and International Cooperation, said that Tunisia's 
foreign direct investment (FDI) jumped to a record 2.0 billion 
dinars (US $1.6 billion) in 2007, thanks to higher inflows in the 
tourism and energy sectors.  FDI in tourism and real estate more 
than doubled to 72 million dinars (US $57 million) in 2007 compared 
to 2006.  The energy sector drew 1.35 billion dinars (US $1.07 
billion) versus 940.3 million dinars (US $714.63 million) in 2006, 
while services attracted 146.4 million dinars (US $115.66 million), 
up 32.1 percent in 2007.  The services sector represents 45 percent 
of the country gross domestic product (GDP) and is seen rising to 50 
percent in 2011.  FDI in the labor-intensive manufacturing sector 
stood at 485.7 million dinars (US $383.7 million) compared to 347.4 
million dinars (US $264.02 million) in 2006, and created 17,356 new 
jobs.  According to Zekri, the GOT hopes FDI will account for 26.1 
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2016 from an expected 
22.7 percent this year. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment: Rising FDI has been generated by the 
implementation of the Tunisian-EU Association Agreement, GOT 
investment policy in telecommunications and privatizations and 
concessions, which helped attract European companies and branches of 
foreign companies established in Europe to invest in Tunisia. 
Additionally, Tunisia is witnessing significant growth in Gulf FDI 
(reftel).  End Comment.

GOT Allocates US $802.94 million for Subsidies 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶6. (U) Tunisia's 2008 state budget has allocated US $802.94 million 
for the General Subsidy Fund (CGC), which primarily subsidizes basic 
food and energy products.  Record prices of oil and other world 
commodities prompted authorities to adopt a budget supplemental in 
December 2007, which effectively doubled subsidies to 1.3 percent of 
 
TUNIS 00000199  002 OF 002 
 
 
GDP.  However, the May and October 2007 increases in retail gas 
prices kept oil subsidies at the budgeted 1 percent of GDP. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment: In its January's Article IV report, the IMF 
recommended Tunisia consider less costly alternatives for protecting 
the purchasing power of low-income households.  One contact has 
estimated that 18,000 jobs are lost every year as a result of waste 
associated with the GOT subsidies.  Ironically, many subsidies 
benefit for the middle and upper classes just as much as if not more 
than low-income earners.  For example, the flour that is subsidized 
is used not only in bread but in pastries; the cement that is 
subsidized is used for new construction that the poor cannot afford; 
neither do the poor benefit as directly from subsidized fuel as do 
those who can afford to own their own vehicles.  The GOT is caught 
between its reluctance to risk social unrest and its efforts to keep 
the state budget deficit at 3 percent of GDP.  End Comment.

Tunisia, Morocco Strengthen Economic Co-operation 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶8. (U) On February 23, the prime ministers of Morocco and Tunisia 
concluded the 14th High Joint Moroccan-Tunisian Committee meetings 
in Tunis with the signing of eight new cooperation agreements. 
Among the agreements, the two sides agreed to facilitate the 
operation of a direct sea line between Tunisia and Morocco, which 
will further facilitate bilateral trade, following the signature of 
an open skies agreement in 2007.  The ministers also announced a 
goal of increasing bilateral trade from US $304.15 million in 2007 
to US $500 million per annum. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Comment: Tunisia and Morocco are expected to finalize 
details of a free trade agreement by May 2008.  Despite competition 
in the tourism sector, the two countries seek to improve economic 
relations within North Africa and with the European Union.  End 
Comment.
