The Ambassador raised the issue of trafficking in persons 
with Justice Minister Bechir Tekkari during his October 5 
introductory call.  Noting Tunisia's debut in the annual TIP 
report, and its placement on the Tier II Watchlist, the 
Ambassdor urged the GOT to increase its focus on this 
compelling transnational problem.  It would be particularly 
important for the GOT to name a central point of contact with 
whom the Embassy could discuss concrete steps Tunisia could 
take to strengthen its anti-TIP regime and improve its 
standing in the TIP report.  Tekkari named Ministry of 
Justice "Coordinator General Khemakhem" as an interlocutor 
for the Embassy on the issue.  The Embassy will be following 
up with the GOT to discuss implementation of the workplan 
conveyed reftel.
