ASSASSINATION 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Official and private Tunisians were quick 
to denounce the December 27 assassination of former Pakistani 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.  On December 27, the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs "firmly condemned" the assassination and 
reasserted Tunisia's rejection of all forms of terrorism. 
Tunisian media headlined the "tragedy" and lamented the blow 
to democracy.  Local contacts also condemned the "abominable" 
act and expressed concern for stability in the Arab and 
Muslim world.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) 12/27/07 MFA Statement (official Tunisia Africa News 
Agency translation): 
 
Begin Text: 
 
Following the assassination of Pakistani former prime 
minister Benazir Bhutto, the foreign ministry released the 
following communique: "Tunisia learned with deep regret and 
dismay the news of the assassination of Pakistani former 
prime minister Benazir Bhutto. 
 
While firmly condemning this appalling criminal act, Tunisia 
expresses its solidarity with the Pakistani brotherly people 
and its care for its security and stability. 
 
In another connection, Tunisia reasserts its rejection of 
terrorism under all its forms and calls once more the 
international community to combine efforts to contain this 
dangerous phenomenon." 
 
End Text. 
 
¶3. (U) Tunisian media headlined Bhutto's death and 
highlighted the GOT condemnation of "this criminal act." 
Citing texts of Bhutto's own statements against extremism, 
private French daily Le Temps headlined her passing as "The 
assassination of a symbol."  Predictions that this was the 
end of the democratic process in Pakistan were a common 
thread in all papers.  Under the title "The Price of 
Democracy," a front page editorial by Ali Tlili in the Arabic 
daily as-Sabah opined "many calculations and facts are likely 
to be changed...by the Pakistani street once it recovers from 
its state of shock."  In the privately-owned Arabic daily 
ash-Shourouq, Mohamed Hedi Haydar compared the situation in 
Pakistan ("assassination, strife and internal fighting") to 
Lebanon and blamed the USG for causing Bhutto's death. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Private Embassy contacts also characterized the 
assassination as a tragedy.  One retired Tunisian diplomat 
told A/DCM that Bhutto's death was a "blow" not only for 
Pakistan, but also for democracy.  A labor activist told 
PolOff that Tunisians were "traumatized" by the frightening 
event.  Several contacts opined that leaders, including 
Tunisian President Ben Ali, and elites in the Arab and Muslim 
world today are likely fearful for their own futures.  While 
lamenting the "serial" nature of suspicious deaths in 
Bhutto's family, another contact suggested that the 
Government of Pakistan may have been involved in her 
assassination.
