SECTION 7088(C)(1) 
 
REF: A. STATE 28885 
     ¶B. 08 TUNIS 237 
 
¶1. (U)  The Government of Tunisia will receive the following 
foreign assistance for FY09: US$ 10 million in Foreign 
Military Financing (FMF), and US$1.7 million in International 
Military Education and Training (IMET). 
 
¶2. (U)  The Government of Tunisia's national budget is 
publicly available and is published in the official gazette 
and on the internet.  It details both income and 
expenditures.  According to Tunisian law, the parliamentary 
debates on the annual budget are open to the public.  The 
Tunisian Court of Accountability -- the Tunisian counterpart 
to the US Government Accounting Office -- monitors and 
investigates the use of GOT funds. 
 
¶3. (U)  Tunisia's ranking on Transparency International's 
(TI) Corruption Index has dropped from 51 in 2006 to 62 in 
2008 (out of 180 countries) with a score of 4.4.  According 
to the TI Corruption Index scale, a score of ten indicates 
extremely little corruption and a score of zero very serious 
corruption.  There is no single GOT ministry or agency with a 
specific anti-corruption mandate, although the Court of 
Accountability may investigate allegations of corruption 
through the course of their normal reviews.
