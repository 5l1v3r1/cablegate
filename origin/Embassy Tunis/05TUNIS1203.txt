In Second Shared Futures Event, 40 High School Students From 
Kelibia Visit American Center and Receive Bags 
 
¶1. On June 2, 40 high schoolers and two of their English 
teachers from Kelibia, a small fishing port one and a half 
hours from Tunis, visited the American Center as part of an 
educational field trip during which they spent half a day at 
the Embassy, touring the IRC, surfing the net and admiring 
the American art works exhibited on the premises. An 
AMIDEAST representative, Leila Zahmoul made a Powerpoint 
presentation through which she introduced the YES, PLUS and 
Fulbright programs and gave an overview on the AMIDEAST 
homestay program in the US. The economic and political 
specialist in the MEPI office, Wahid Labidi also addressed 
the group focusing on the importance of voluntary and 
associative work and how MEPI assists in that respect. The 
session closed with the DCM and PAO taking questions and 
distributing Shared Future bookbags to all participants. 
The students also received copies of HI Magazine and other 
IIP materials. 
 
Result: 40 High School students from a remote city gain a 
better knowledge of the services offered by the Embassy and 
gain a better understanding of the US and its people.  They 
receive a concrete token of friendship from the American 
people. 
 
 
 
Fulbright Scholar Conducts Round Table on Women's Views of 
Native Americans for American Studies Students and Scholars 
 
¶2. On June 2, Fulbright scholar Starr Ackley conducted a 
round table discussion with more than 50 American Studies 
students and scholars on "A Positive View of Native 
Americans: Or What Women Saw than Men did Not" in which she 
examined women's writings about Native Americans.  Her 
approach offered a different view of Native Americans than 
that found in much of the literature.  Starr drew on her 
three-year experience as a Fulbright scholar in Tunisia to 
present a rich and challenging look at American literature 
about Native Americans. 
 
Result: More than 50 American studies scholars gain more 
insight of the literary texts dealing with Native Americans.
