¶1. (U) Summary: Ambassador Hudson paid a farewel call on 
Minister of Development and Internationl Cooperation (MDIC) 
Mohamed Nouri Jouini on Jun 20, 2006.  The Ambassador 
delivered a letter frm USTR concerning a proposed June 30, 
2006 meetin between the minister and AUSTR Donnelly 
(SEPTEL. The discussion centered on the investment climat, 
the economy, and the important role that the ministry plays 
in the economic future of Tunisia.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) The Ambassador met with Minister of Development and 
International Cooperation Mohamed Nouri Jouini on June 20, 
¶2006.  The Ambassador expressed his appreciation for the 
quality of cooperation that he has received during his tenure 
in Tunisia.  He indicated that Tunisia had made progress on 
TRIPS compliance and that it was not listed on this year's 
Special 301 list because the MDIC and the Ministry of Public 
Health took the issue of IPR seriously.  The Ambassador also 
noted that he sensed a more positive American attitude 
towards investment in Tunisia.  This is largely due to the 
efforts of MDIC and of The Foreign Investment Promotion 
Agency (L'agence de Promotion des Investissements Exterieur, 
FIPA).  The Ambassador indicated that FIPA has been a very 
effective and supportive organization.  Ambassador stated 
that MDIC is key for U.S. investment in Tunisia and key for 
Tunisia's economic future. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Ambassador applauded the GOT's interest in 
promoting higher technology investments.  In this vein, the 
Ambassador inquired about a recent meeting with a major US 
high tech company interested in making a sizable investment 
in Tunisia.  The Ambassador indicated that this was a new 
level of high technology and that the investment would be the 
first of its kind in the Maghreb region.  The Ambassador 
indicated that if this deal goes through it would be a good 
signal for other U.S. investors.  He indicated that success 
stories are good for Tunisia as they tend to spread the word 
on its investment climate.  The minister responded that the 
meeting had gone well and that the GOT was very interested in 
the proposal.  The minister indicated that FIPA and MDIC 
would be working with this investor to come up with 
appropriate programs and incentives to close the deal.  The 
minister also said that this investment would be a new type 
of partnership but that it fit in well with the GOT's policy 
to generate new investments and economic progress.  The 
minister stated that he felt this venture could be the 
beginning of a new trend for U.S. investment in Tunisia. 
 
¶5. (U) Minister Jouini thanked the Ambassador for building a 
cooperative relationship with the GOT and for his commitment 
to maintaining an open dialogue which helped strengthen our 
relationship.  The minister said that it is important for 
governments to dialogue in order to make progress.  He hoped 
that this open dialogue would continue with the Ambassador's 
successor.  The minister said that MDIC works as a team and 
that they are aware of the challenges ahead for Tunisia 
(employment issues, growth conditions, economic and 
demography changes).  He knows that the next 10 years are 
critical ones for the GOT.  The GOT is a developing country 
and it knows what it can do and what it cannot do.  The 
minister indicated that the pressure on GOT is high and so it 
must make the necessary changes to meet the challenges it 
faces.  According to the minister research and education 
needs to accept constant change in order to keep pace with 
the ever changing technology.  The minister indicated that 
the GOT will be focusing on the need for transfer of 
knowledge and technology in order to meet future challenges. 
 
¶6. (U) The minister said that the GOT is on the right path 
and that he is satisfied with the continuous dialogue he has 
had with investors.  He stressed that he felt there was a 
need to get the Tunisian private sector more involved in this 
dialogue and to get the business community working with the 
GOT to make the positive message about doing business in 
Tunisia more credible. The minister said that the GOT needs 
to fine tune its economic reform efforts by paying attention 
to the details. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment: Due to the GOT's overweening desire for 
control, Jouini and his ministry are occasionally dealt a 
difficult hand in promoting investment and trade 
relationships. They are, however, the most professional, 
progressive, and responsive actors in the GOT, and, arguably, 
Tunisian trade and investment. End comment.
