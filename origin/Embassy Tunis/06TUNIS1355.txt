Following Ambassador's June 1 demarche (Ref A), on June 3 the 
Tunisia-Africa Press Agency (TAP) published the following MFA 
statement (TAP translation) on Iran in support of USG 
initiatives regarding direct negotiations with Iran: 
 
An authorized source from the Foreign Ministry stated that 
Tunisia, which is following with great interest these 
developments, calls one more time for the need to resort to 
dialogue and consultation in international relations and 
favorably welcomes any initiative that would help bolster the 
chances of reaching a peaceful and negotiated outcome for 
this issue. 
 
The same source added that Tunisia, whilst reminding of its 
constant stand on the utilisation of nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes, in total compliance with the international 
conventions, and its repudiation of the proliferation of 
weapons of mass-destruction, urges all sides to do their 
utmost to arrive at a negotiated agreement, in such a way to 
solidify security, peace and stability in the region.
