¶1. (SBU) On February 19, Tunisian media reported that the 
Ministry of Interior had increased auto traffic fines for 
moving violations, including for speeding, driving without a 
safety belt, and using cell phones while driving.  The fine 
for using a phone while driving increased from TD 20 (USD 
14.32) to TD 60 (USD 42.98). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  While we do not believe this step was 
taken in response to our January 25 demarche (reftels - we 
have yet to receive an official reply), the increased fines 
clearly indicate that the GOT is also concerned about the 
dangers of distracted driving and the toll it is taking on 
the public's health and safety.  End comment.
