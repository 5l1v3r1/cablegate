Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) Recently appointed Minister of Agriculture Abdesselem 
Mansour, long a contact of the US Embassy, told the Ambassador in a 
December 12 meeting that he will seek to improve cooperation. 
Mansour asked for scholarships for Tunisian agricultural engineers 
and suggested the two governments explore ways to increase 
agribusiness development and investment.  The Ambassador stressed US 
interest in cooperation on agriculture.  He noted current programs 
such as the Cochrane Fellowship, touted opportunities for Tunisia 
under GSP, and discussed a visit by the new US Agriculture Attache 
in Rabat.  The Minister highlighted his interest in increasing 
exports, particularly to the United States, noting that doing so 
fits squarely with a central theme of the GOT's 11th economic 
development plan.  End Summary.

More On Cooperation 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) During a December 12 meeting, the Ambassador and recently 
appointed Agricultural Minister Abdessalam Mansour explored areas 
for cooperation.  Early in the conversation, the Minister expressed 
an interest in increasing Tunisian agricultural exports to the 
United States.  The Ambassador responded by noting the recent visit 
of USTR Executive Director for GPS, Marideth Sandler, and the many 
opportunities that exist for Tunisian farmers under the program. 
The Ambassador also offered to ask whether a visit to Tunisia by a 
regional USDA phyto-sanitary expert could be arranged. 
 
¶3.  (U) Mansour mentioned that he had helped establish the Tunisian 
American Date company in the 1980s, saying he would like replicate 
this success as Minister.  He also asked for increased access to 
scholarships and technical exchanges.  The Ambassador stressed the 
value of the Cochrane Scholarship program, which the Minister agreed 
was useful.  The Ambassador also highlighted opportunities offered 
by the Trade and Development Agency (TDA), noting the recent visit 
here by senior TDA representatives.  The Minister expressed a strong 
interest.  The Ambassador also suggested that a visit to the 
Ministry by the recently arrived US Agricultural Attach based in 
Rabat would serve to strengthen engagement.  The Minister agreed and 
offered to assist in organizing it.

Current State of Tunisian Agricultural Affairs 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4. (U) Mansour said Tunisia was making good progress in 
strengthening the agriculture sector, as demonstrated by the wide 
variety of produce grown here.  Many Tunisian staples, such as 
tomatoes and onions, are available year-round.  Mansour expressed 
some concern about the lack of rainfall, noting however that the 
problem principally affected the north and central eastern areas. 
He underscored the importance of grain and cereal production to the 
GOT, and said the government planned to open an institute for 
cereals extension in two to three months.  He also mentioned that 
the GOT is seeking partnerships for the institute.  Ambassador Godec 
responded by offering to support additional exchanges and to 
consider if there are possible US partners. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Tunisia - EU Agricultural Negotiations 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Mansour said Tunisia is heading into the third round of 
talks on agricultural trade with the EU in January 2009.  (Note: In 
a separate conversation with EconOff, Fabian Seiderer from the EU 
Commission confirmed that these negotiations would be a tough slog, 
as the GOT is not skilled in engaging the private sector to 
determine what goals to pursue.  Seiderer went on to add that the 
GOT publicly expresses great interest in moving forward but that 
behind the scenes they are slow to take action and respond to 
offers.) 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Biographic Background on the New Minister 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Abdessalam Mansour is an advocate of the free market and 
supports strong ties between the United States and Tunisia.  Long a 
good contact of the Embassy, he remains open to engaging with us, 
but now that he is a Minister he can do so only with the permission 
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
¶7. (U) Mansour graduated from the University of Tunis in 1971 with a 
BA in Economics and earned a Masters in Agricultural Economics from 
the University of Minnesota class of 1974.  He began his career as 
an engineer for the Ministry of Agriculture.  He served as the 
economic advisor to the Kuwaiti Economic and Social Development Fund 
and later served as the Director of projects for the Tunisian-Saudi 
Investment fund.  In 1999 he was named as the President of the 
Executive Board and Director General of the Foreign Investment 
Promotion Agency (FIPA).  He also served as an active member of 
board of directors of the Tunisian-American Chamber of Commerce. 
Minister Mansour is 59 and hails from Sousse.  He is married with 
two children and is fluent in English, French and Arabic.  His most 
recent visit to the United States was in May 2008 to attend a 
week-long workshop on small and medium enterprise development in 
Kansas City that was hosted by the OECD.
