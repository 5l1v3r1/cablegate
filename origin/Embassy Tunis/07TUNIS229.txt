In response to reftel request, Post nominates Khedija Cherif, 
President of the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women, 
for the Secretary's International Women of Courage Award and 
provides the following justification and contact information: 
 
Khedija Cherif was elected President of the Tunisian 
Association of Democratic Women (ATFD) in 2006.  A 
sociologist and university professor, Cherif has a long 
history of civil society activism to advance women's rights 
in particular and human rights in Tunisia more generally.  As 
president of the ATFD and a longtime member of the 
organization, Cherif manages an organization of several 
hundred women who seek to advance women's rights in Tunisia. 
The ATFD works to eliminate discrimination, defend existing 
legal rights, advance sexual equality, and encourage women's 
participation in social and political life.  Despite many 
advances in women's rights in Tunisia, the ATFD continues to 
press for inheritance equality and educate the public about 
domestic abuse, including operating a shelter for battered 
women.  The ATFD, due to its strong feminist leanings, also 
vigorously combats all forms of religious fundamentalism. 
 
Despite being a registered NGO since 1989, the ATFD suffers 
from official and quasi-official harassment.  Government 
security forces monitor ATFD events, and often individual 
members.  Members report that the GOT has prevented ATFD 
awareness campaigns, restricted access to the press, blocked 
meetings, and instructed hotels not to rent space to ATFD for 
public events.  Foreign funding for ATFD activities is 
blocked by the Tunisian Central Bank.  Mail, phone and 
Internet communications are disrupted, both that at the ATFD 
offices and that of individual members.  The Tunisian media 
denounces members as "prostitutes" and "lesbians." 
 
In addition to her ATFD leadership, Cherif is well-known in 
Tunisia for her political activism.  Cherif is also a former 
vice president of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH) and 
a founding member of the unregistered NGO the National 
Council for Liberty in Tunisia (CNLT).  Cherif has reported 
being harassed and assaulted for her activism.  Most 
recently, Tunisian security forces reportedly assaulted her 
when she tried to attend a May 2006 LTDH anniversary event. 
Cherif is also active in the international human rights 
community and participates in many international conferences. 
 In 2001, she experienced inexplicable delays in passport 
issuance that temporarily prevented her travel abroad. 
 
Despite these difficulties, Cherif continues her social and 
political activism.  Her 2006 election as ATFD President has 
only increased her visibility in Tunisian civil society 
circles.  Cherif is thus one of the most prominent Tunisian 
individuals seeking to advance women's rights and, more 
generally, human rights in Tunisia today.
