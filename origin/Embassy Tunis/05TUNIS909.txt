LICENSE 05-953951 FOR BELL HELICOPTER SPARE PARTS TO TUNISIA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 51325 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post has made appropriate inquiries to establish the 
legitimacy of a transaction for the export of AB205 Bell 
helicopter spare parts to Tunisia and concludes that it is a 
legitimate transaction.  In addition, the post has 
investigated concerns regarding the end user, the Tunisian 
Army, and the large quantity of Bell helicopter spare parts 
in this order, and has assessed the risk of a diversion as 
very low. 
 
¶2.  (U) The Tunisian Ministry of Defense confirms that the 
Tunisian Air Force not, repeat not, the Tunisian Army has a 
contract with SW Florida Aviation to repair its AB205 Bell 
Helicopters.  The repair work is carried out at the Sidi 
Ahmed Air Base in Tunisia.  Supply contract #CM/MDN/2004 is 
currently in place with SW Florida Aviation.  The contract is 
dated September 27, 2004 and covers work for one year.  The 
Tunisian military utilizes AB205 Bell Helicopters primarily 
for internal troop movements and border surveillance.  The 
AB205 Bell Helicopters are also used for VIP government 
transportation and logistics requirements as needed. 
 
¶3.  (U) SW Florida Technicians (part of SW Florida Aviation) 
has operated an office in Tunis since November 2004.  The 
Tunisian Air force is the sole client of SW Florida 
Technicians (SW Florida Aviation) in Tunisia.  Post has no 
information available on the number of clients throughout the 
region for either SW Florida Technicians or SW Florida 
Aviation.  Post recommends that PM/DTCC seek information on 
regional clients directly from SW Florida Technicians or SW 
Florida Aviation or from other regional posts with SW Florida 
Technicians or SW Florida Aviation offices.
