Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) After Minister of Development and International 
Cooperation (MDIC) Jouini expressed interest in reviving the 
Trade Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) process (stalled 
since March 2008,) Tunisia Country Officer Molly Hayes and 
Emboffs met with the Americas Desk representatives of the 
MDIC and MFA on November 10.  Although the meeting was billed 
as "unofficial," the MDIC representative delved into 
specifics of the agreement and even suggested a January 2010 
meeting between relevant GOT ministries and the Embassy. 
When asked about Open Skies, our GOT interlocutors said it 
would happen, reiterated their wish for a direct flight to 
the United States, but provided no specifics.  Meanwhile, 
Tunisair's website is announcing direct flights by 2013.  End 
summary.

Re-engaging on TIFA 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Following the suggestion of Minister of Development 
and International Cooperation (MDIC) Jouini to the Ambassador 
on October 19 (reftel), MDIC and MFA representatives met with 
visiting country  officer Hayes and Emboffs to discuss 
reviving the Trade Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) 
process.  The meeting, described by the MDIC as "unofficial," 
was an opportunity to review progress on the TIFA process 
since the last working group met in March 2008.  (Note:  The 
GOT stopped engaging on TIFA after the March 2008 visit by 
then-AUSTR Donnelly.  In an August 2009 meeting with a 
congressional delegation led by Representative Meeks, Jouini 
claimed the inaction was due to U.S. trade policy changes and 
the expiration of Trade Promotion Authority in U.S. Congress. 
 End note.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Emboffs met with Ikbel Fekkih Ahmed, who covers the 
Americas portfolio at the MDIC (she is new to the portfolio). 
 Mourad Bel Hassen, Deputy Director of the MFA Americas Desk, 
was also in attendance.  Ahmed was well-organized, pragmatic, 
and forward-leaning in discussing the working group's 
objectives and Government of Tunisia (GOT) reforms since 
then.  Ahmed began by outlining both President Ben Ali's 
campaign plan and the 2007-2011 National Development Plan -- 
described as complementary plans with the same overall goals. 
 She stated some 2011 targets, such as a seven percent growth 
rate, a rise in GDP per capita to 5763 TND ($4486,) up from 
4064 TND, ($3163 currently), a two percent increase in 
foreign direct investment (to 25 percent of GDP, versus 23 
percent currently), a reduction of the unemployment rate to 
13.4 percent (down from 14.3 percent currently) and 
reinforcement of export promotion and human resources 
development policies.  TIFA, Ahmed said, would be part of 
this plan. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Investment, Services, Market Access, and IPR 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  The TIFA discussion centered on the four main areas 
covered by the last working group:  investment, services, 
market access, and intellectual property rights (IPR).  On 
investment, Ahmed said foreign direct investment (FDI) had 
grown in the last years thanks to Tunisia's reforms and 
policies, specifically taxation laws.  She also raised 
concerns about Tunisian investors facing obstacles in 
obtaining residency permits in the United States.  She also 
said she was aware of the issues facing major U.S. investors 
in Tunisia, such as the restriction on the number of 
expatriate employees per company.  She said the GOT was 
willing to look at this on a case by case basis. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Ahmed noted many of the reforms Tunisia is 
undertaking as part of the EU Association Agreement and 
ongoing negotiations on services and agriculture are in line 
with TIFA working group issues.  (Note:  Ahmed said a 
Tunisian delegation was currently in Brussels for the next EU 
 
negotiating round.  End note.)  Market access reform, she 
said, had already taken place in key sectors such as 
financial services, insurance and telecom.  Ahmed asked for 
further information on services legislation in the United 
States and information on U.S. policy regarding rules of 
origin, customs procedures, Food and Drug Administration 
regulations for imports, and sector specific policies 
(textiles, shoes, leather good, agriculture and fisheries). 
 
¶6. (SBU) On IPR, Ahmed did not delve into specifics on the 
Tunisian position and admitted she did not have detailed 
knowledge of new legislation in this field.  She did, 
however, note that she wanted information on patent 
legislation in the United States and was interested in 
knowing the U.S. position on geographical indicators, an 
issue important to the Tunisian government. 
 
------------------------- 
Nothing new on Open Skies 
------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Emboffs asked the MDIC and MFA reps about the status 
of an Open Skies Agreement.  Bel Hassen said "it is going to 
happen" but that it is a question of timing.  He asked if 
there had been any interest by U.S. airlines in a direct 
flight, saying this would be a key deliverable for the GOT. 
He noted Tunisair had purchased new planes that could be used 
for this route.  On the sidelines, he also urged Emboffs to 
send the model Open Skies text directly to the MDIC and as 
many other ministries as possible in order to get a response 
from the GOT.  Meanwhile, Tunisair (the state-owned airline) 
announced via press release on their website that direct 
flights were planned for 2013. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Next Steps:  GOT Interagency Group 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) To the surprise of Emboffs, it was Ahmed herself 
that suggested a January meeting between representatives of 
relevant GOT ministries and the Embassy to move forward on 
TIFA.  She suggested Ministry of Health, Commerce, Culture, 
Finance, and Foreign Affairs, among others. She noted the 
group could meet periodically in preparation for another 
official TIFA Working Group meeting down the line.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) The MDIC's enthusiasm about reviving the TIFA 
process seems genuine, especially given that it recommended a 
follow-up meeting with wider GOT participation.  Some GOT 
reforms in the last 18 months, such as telecom liberalization 
(the GOT awarded a third telecom tender) and the new 
franchising law (whose implementation decree is still 
pending) are positive steps toward achieving the working 
group's goals.  The Embassy is looking forward to engaging 
with the GOT on this issue, and will provide the MDIC with 
requested information.  On Open Skies, the ball is still in 
Tunisia's court, and we remain in standby mode awaiting a 
response to our draft text.  End comment.
