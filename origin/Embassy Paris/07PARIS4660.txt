SUBJECT: FRANCE SUSPENDS MON810/ CREATES BIOTECH PLANNING AUTHORITY 
 
REF:  (A) PARIS 4606 (B) PARIS 4646 
 
¶1.  Summary:  On December 6, the government published a ministerial 
order suspending the sale and use of MON810 corn seeds, and a decree 
instituting a new interim biotech committee on GMOs.  This authority 
will have two subcommittees, one will be scientific, while the other 
will focus on social, economic and ethical issues.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  As expected (ref A), Agriculture Minister Barnier signed a 
suspension of the "transfer to final user and use of MON810 corn 
seeds until a law on GMOs is published, or at the latest, February 
9, 2008." 
 
¶3.  Environment Minister Borloo announced today that Jean-Francois 
Legrand, Senator from Normandy and former President of the Grenelle 
Biotech Working Group, will be the President of the new Biotech 
interim committee.  Ministers of Environment, Agriculture, Research 
and Health will jointly designate the 34 members of the new biotech 
committee and may refer any issue relative to GMOs to it.  The 
Committee will review the effects of Mon810 on the environment and 
public health.  The committee is further to evaluate the mission, 
composition and operation of the proposed High Authority on GMOs 
which will subsequently be created.  The interim authority's 15 
member scientific subcommittee will include a wide range of 
scientific expertise, including biodiversity, ecology, genetics, 
molecular biology, toxicology, population genetics, genetic therapy, 
epidemiology, agronomy, entomology, microbiology, veterinary 
sciences, biomedical sciences, statistics, and virology. 
 
¶4.  The interim authority's social, economic and ethic subcommittee 
will be comprised of 19 members, including specialists in law, 
economy, sociology, a member of the National Ethics Committee for 
Life Sciences and Health, representatives from environmental, 
consumer, public health organizations, local authorities, biotech 
industry, farm industry and biotech industry employee groups.  There 
will also be a representative from the Parliamentary Committee of 
Science and Technology Evaluation. 
 
¶5.  Comment:  As anticipated, French authorities are not suspending 
the MON810 authorization based on the safeguard clause, most likely 
due to concerns about EC and international perceptions.  The 
suspension's deadline of February 9 indicates the Government's 
objective to have the new biotech law in place by this date. 
Whether this objective is feasible remains to be seen.  End 
Comment.
