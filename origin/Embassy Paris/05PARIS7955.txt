SUBJECT:  DOD DIRECT PARTICIPATION IN trade shows 2007 
 
¶1.  IN ANTICIPATION OF Euronaval 2006 and the PARIS AIR SHOW 2007, 
the Ambassador and the U.S. Embassy Paris Country Team strongly 
support and encourage FULL AND DIRECT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
PARTICIPATION IN THese IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL EVENTs. 
¶2.  Exposure and Outcomes.  EURONAVAL, scheduled for 23-27 OCT 
2006 and THE PARIS AIRSHOW 2007, SCHEDULED FOR 18-24 JUNE 2007, 
will provide UNEQUALLED EXPOSURE FOR THE BEST IN U.S. Maritime and 
AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY.  EURONAVAL 2004 WELCOMED NEARLY 300 
EXHIBITORS FROM 25 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE.  Likewise, NEARLY 500,000 
VISITORS REPRESENTING OVER 88 COUNTRIES ATTENDED Paris AirSHOW 
¶2005.  More than 50% of those attendees were trade professionals. 
PARTICIPATION IN THeSe TRADE SHOWs PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT 
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE U.S. TO SHOWCASE ITS TECHNICAL AND MILITARY 
LEADERSHIP WITHIN THE REGION AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, AROUND THE 
WORLD. 
¶3.  LINKAGE TO STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.  OUR PRESENCE AT TRADE SHOWS 
ADVANCES U.S. SECURITY INTERESTS, ILLUSTRATES OUR COMMITMENT TO 
OUR ALLIANCES AND INTEROPERABILITY AND PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
BUILD THE RIGHT COALITION PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE FUTURE. 
PARTICIPATION IN Trade shows DIRECTLY SUPPORTS THE MISSION'S 
PRIORITIES OF STRENGTHENING OUR TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP AND 
THEREBY PROMOTING REGIONAL STABILITY, INCREASING TRADE AND 
INVESTMENT AND POSITIVELY INFLUENCING EUROPEAN PUBLIC OPINION. 
THE PRESENCE OF SENIOR CIVILIAN AND MILITARY OFFICERS SIGNALS THE 
IMPORTANCE WE ATTACH TO THESE SHARED GOALS AND OFFERS AN 
ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ENHANCED CONTACTS AND CONSULTATIONS. 
IN ADDITION, A HIGH-LEVEL LEADERSHIP PRESENCE REINFORCES U.S. 
COMMERCIAL EFFORTS AND HELPS TO ENSURE THAT COMPETING INDUSTRIAL 
TECHNOLOGIES DO NOT DOMINATE THE LOCAL MARKETS.  LACK OF SENIOR- 
LEVEL PARTICIPATION SENDS A SIGNAL, EASILY MISINTERPRETED BY U.S. 
CRITICS AS A LACK OF COMMITMENT TO THE ALLIANCE AND TO EUROPEAN 
SECURITY COMMITMENTS, AS WELL AS OF POTENTIAL UNWILLINGNESS TO 
ADVANCE INTEROPERABILITY OF OUR FORCES WITH TRADITIONAL AND 
EMERGING ALLIES.  A shrinking industrial base and evolving Defense 
cooperation in Armaments guidance elevates the importance of 
interaction with industrialized nations with whom cooperation 
across the full spectrum of defense technologies is possible. One 
can be sure that industry from these countries will be well 
represented and this forum provides unequalled access to view peer- 
level technology. 
¶4.  THE EUROPEAN UNION CONTINUES TO PRESS ITS MEMBERS TO THINK AND 
BUY EUROPEAN.  MANY OF OUR SYSTEMS ARE IN HEATED PROCUREMENT 
COMPETITIONS THROUGHOUT EUROPE FOR LIMITED DEFENSE RESOURCES.  WE 
THEREFORE ADVOCATE DISPLAY AND DEMONSTRATION OF SYSTEMS THAT 
SHOWCASE U.S. TECHNOLOGICAL SUPERIORITY AND INTEROPERABILITY.  IN 
COORDINATION WITH OTHER EUROPEAN OFFICES OF DEFENSE COOPERATION, 
WE OFFER THE FOLLOWING LIST AS A STARTING POINT FOR CONSIDERATION: 
¶A.  FILL NATO'S CRITICAL CAPABILITY GAPS AND PROMOTE 
MODERNIZATION.  WE RECOMMEND DISPLAYING THOSE SYSTEMS AND 
CAPABILITIES THAT THE U.S. IS UNIQUELY ABLE TO PROVIDE:  C-17, 
LASER-GUIDED AND GPS GUIDED ALL-WEATHER MUNITIONS, ELECTRONIC 
WARFARE AND C4I, PARTICULARLY DATA LINKS, SECURE COMMUNICATIONS, 
AND DEPLOYABLE SATCOM. 
¶B.  CONTINUE MOMENTUM ON THE NATO'S GROUND SURVEILLANCE (AGS) 
PROGRAM.  WE RECOMMEND INCLUSION OF GLOBAL HAWK AND E-8 JOINT 
STARS.  ADDITIONALLY, UAVS WILL BE A HIGHLIGHTED SECTOR IN THE 
SHOW.  RECOMMEND THAT PREDATOR, FIRE SCOUT, X-45 UCAV, X-47 UCAV 
AND EAGLE EYE BE INCLUDED. 
¶C.  DEMONSTRATE SUSTAINED TECHNOLOGICAL SUPERIORITY IN FIGHTERS 
AND SUPPORT REGIONAL COMPETITIONS: F-22, JSF, F-16, AND F/A-18. 
¶D.  GENERATE INTEREST IN A SUPPLEMENTAL LIFT SOURCE TO THE A-400M: 
C-130J.  THE C-130J IS BEING CONSIDERED TO BRIDGE RETIREMENT OF C- 
160S AND DELIVERY OF THE A-400M.  ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS INTEREST 
IN THE KC-130J TO SATISFY A HELICOPTER AERIAL REFUELING SHORTFALL

¶5.  U.S. EMBASSY PARIS CONSIDERS EURONAVAL 2006 and Paris Air Show 
2007 TIMELY OPPORTUNITies TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE UNITED STATES 
REMAINS A COMMITTED PARTNER IN ACHIEVING GLOBAL SECURITY AND 
STABILITY.  IT IS IN BOTH THE U.S. AND THE EUROPEAN INTEREST THAT 
WE CONTINUE TO PROMOTE INTEROPERABILITY, ESPECIALLY THROUGH SHARED 
PROCUREMENT GOALS, AS WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THE WAR AGAINST 
TERRORISM.  THERE IS NO BETTER EXAMPLE OF THIS COMMITMENT THAN 
HAVING ROBUST DOD PARTICIPATION IN these international trade 
shows.  THE EMBASSY RECOMMENDS DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROVAL FOR 
FULL, DIRECT PARTICIPATION IN EURONAVAL 2006 and Paris Air show 
¶2007.  U.S. EmBASSY PARIS STANDS READY TO COORDINATE AND ASSIST 
WITH THE REQUIRED SUPPORT ACTIVITIES.
