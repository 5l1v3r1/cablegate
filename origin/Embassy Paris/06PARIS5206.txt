SUBJECT: COORDINATING WESTERN SUPPORT FOR FMCT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 120281 
 
Talking points on coordinating Western support for the FMCT 
(reftel) were delivered July 25 to French MFA FMCT Action 
Officer Arnaud Mentre.  In a folllow up conversation on July 
28, Mentre said that the GOF noted, and he personally 
understood the need for a "division of labor" in encouraging 
FMCT support.  He asked that the USG furnish the GOF a 
calendar giving a timeline for U.S. strategy for the FMCT as 
soon as it becomes available.
