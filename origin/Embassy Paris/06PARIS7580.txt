the respective numbers are 01 and 06. 
 
¶3. A block of rooms has been reserved at the Meurice Hotel 
for this conference. The Meurice Hotel is located at 228 Rue 
de Rivoli, 75001, and is within a 10 minute walking distance 
of the Embassy.  The negotiated room rate is 220 Euros per 
night, single occupancy, or approximately USD 266. The 
Meurice Hotel telephone numbers are: (33-1) 44 58 10 10 , 
fax: (33-1) 44 58 10 15.  The room rate is within lodging 
perdiem, though this is subject to fluctuation in the Euro. 
 
¶4. Action request:  If you have not already done so, please 
contact Charles J. Hamblett (hamblettcj@state.gov), and Chanh 
Nguyen (NguyenCT5@state.gov) no later than COB Thursday, 
November 30 to guarantee a room under this block.  Please 
include full name(s), single or double occupancy, arrival and 
departure information, smoking or non smoking desirability, 
credit card type, credit card number, and expiration date. 
 
¶5. We would like to point out that a 48 hour notice is due in 
case of cancellation or modification in travel plans in order 
to avoid no-show charges.  Please be aware that check-in time 
is 3:00 PM, with check-out no later than 12:00.  Breakfast is 
available at the hotel for 30-45 Euros or at the Embassy 
cafeteria for less than 10 Euros, though it does not open 
before 8:30 AM.  Bags can be left at the hotel before 
check-in.  Hotel internet connections are provided gratis.  A 
5 Euro baggage portage fee is charged in and out. Per diem is 
currently $285 for lodging and $155 M&IE.  Taxi fare from 
Charles de Gaulle Roissy Airport to the hotel should not 
exceed approximately 50 Euros. 
 
¶6. Action request:  Please contact Ronald Gain, S/CT, who can 
be reached by unclassified e-mail at GainRL@state.gov or by 
phone, at 202-647-1843, to obtain fiscal data for your travel 
expenses.  In order to avoid any problem with the fluctuation 
in the Euro, we suggest travel orders be drafted to fund 
lodging "at actual cost." We also note that Ambassador 
Stapleton is hosting a dinner at his residence on December 5 
for other Ambassadors in the region and Assistant 
Secretaries, and a lunch at his residence on December 6 for 
 
SIPDIS 
all conference attendees.  M&IE allowances should be reduced 
by the appropriate amounts to cover these costs: 57 Euros for 
dinner and 52 Euros for lunch. 
 
¶7.  Embassy media policy stipulates that any contact of 
visitors with the media be coordinated through the Embassy 
press office at (33-1) 43 12 28 33. 
 
¶8.  Embassy wishes to remind visitors that visas are required 
for holders of U.S. diplomatic or official passports on 
official business in France. 
 
¶9.  Following is current security information for France: 
 
(A)  Terrorism:  The current terrorism threat in France 
mirrors the general worldwide threat.  Trans-national terror 
groups such as al-Qaida likely have a presence in France and 
do present a general threat.  French law enforcement and 
intelligence services are effective in responding to this 
threat and remain in a heightened state of alert, but cannot 
completely negate it.  For this reason American citizens 
should practice good personal security when visiting France. 
Remaining unpredictable is perhaps the simplest but most 
effective way of ensuring personal safety.  This is 
particularly true when departing or arriving at your place of 
residence.  Being aware of your surroundings and suspicious 
persons or activities is also critically important.  Do not 
accept packages, do not open hotel doors to strangers and 
immediately report any suspicious activities to the police 
(telephone 17) and Regional Security Office telephone (33-1) 
43 12 27 96. 
 
(B) Crime:  Street crime in French cities is similar to that 
in most large metropolitan areas. The two most frequent 
crimes are pick pocketing and snatch/run theft.  These 
criminals most often ply their trade on public transportation 
routes used by tourists and at tourist sites.  In Paris, 
visitors should be particularly alert when using Metro lines 
numbers one and two, in addition to the RER trains serving 
the airports.  Tourist sites such as the Eiffel Tower, 
Montmartre, the major museums and the Avenue des Champs 
Elysees are all areas of heavy activity. Visitor should use 
hotel safes whenever possible to store valuables and excess 
cash.  Awareness should go up when conditions are crowded. 
Maintain control of cameras and bags, do not carry these 
items behind you.  Criminals on metros often push into you 
for distraction and pickpocket while doing so.  Another 
technique is to grab valuables and escape just as the metro 
doors are closing.  If credit cards are stolen, proceed to 
the nearest telephone and immediately notify the card issuer. 
 Stolen credit cards are used immediately.  Whenever 
possible, take a seat or keep your back to a wall when on the 
metro system.  It is also recommended that a photocopy of 
your passport identification page be carried in lieu of the 
passport itself.  Report any incidents to the Regional 
Security Office as soon as possible. 
 
(C) Electronic devices:  Privately-owned laptops and personal 
computers are prohibited in controlled access areas (CAAs) of 
the Mission and consulates.  Travelers with USG unclassified 
and classified laptop or notebook computers should review '95 
State 244394 (classified machines) and '95 State 243825 
(unclassified machines) and notify the Information Management 
Office (IMO) before bringing these machines into CAA. 
Cellular telephones are also prohibited in the CAA and must 
be left outside this area.  Questions concerning other types 
of electronic devices may be directed to the Information 
Management Office or Regional Security Office. 
 
(D) For additional threat assessment information regarding 
France and/or Europe, you may contact DS/ITA in the State 
Department at (202) 663-0787.

precautions for France, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) website contains a detailed analysis of
