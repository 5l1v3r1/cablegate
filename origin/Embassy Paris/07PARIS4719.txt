SUBJECT: FRENCH SUGAR BEET GROWERS SUPPORT BIOTECH 
 
¶1. During its annual conference in Paris on December 4, the French 
Sugar Beet Growers' Association (CGB), representing 35,000 French 
sugar beet growers, openly expressed its support for biotechnology. 
The chairman, Dominique Ducroquet, reiterated that in order to 
remain competitive, French sugar beet growers need to have access to 
all available technological improvements, including biotechnology. 
The farm audience applauded this statement. Ducroquet also urged the 
Minister of Agriculture, who was present, not to listen to the 
"merchants of fear," a term used to describe anti-biotech NGOs. 
¶2. Ducroquet criticized the attitude of the Government which, in his 
view, listens more to NGOs ("the groups who talk") than to farm 
groups and farm unions ("the groups who act"). In his speech at the 
conference, Ag Minister Barnier did not mention biotech. 
 
¶3. Seed companies and scientists made presentations on the benefits 
of biotech. The German seed company KWS claimed its biotech programs 
was able increase sugar beet yields, enhance quality and reduce 
costs of production. 
 
¶4. A specialist from the French Technical Institute for Sugar Beets 
cautioned that, unlike in the U.S., there are wild native plants 
related to the sugar beet in the EU, increasing the risk of pollen 
contamination. He stated that a sterile biotech sugar beet could 
address this problem.  A scientist and deputy General Director from 
INRA (French Agricultural Research Institute) delivered a statement 
supporting biotechnology which the audience applauded, emphasizing 
its potential to increase production and productivity. 
 
¶5. Comment: This widely-attended (500 plus) conference was 
significant as it demonstrated biotech support beyond the corn 
growers. Until now, the corn farmers' union has been the most 
solidly pro-biotech producers' union. End Comment.
