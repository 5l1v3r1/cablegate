SUBJECT:  FRANCE:  R/V CORWITH CRAMER RESEARCH CLEARANCE REQUEST: 
OCTOBER 12 THROUGH NOVEMBER 19, 2006 
 
REF:  (A) STATE DEPARTMENT FILE NO.: 2006 - 040 
 
      (B) SECSTATE 65280 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  Embassy received research clearance for the subject vessel 
(Reftel A) from the MFA under cover of diplomatic note number 
1202/AME dated 11 October 2006.  The note states that the French 
authorities have no objection to the research campaign of the 
Corwith Cramer in the French waters of the Guadeloupe and Martinique 
from 12 October 2006 to 19 November 2006. The note further states 
that local authorities have been informed. 
 
¶2.  (U)  The note further indicates that the French authorities do 
not wish that "heavy seismic operations" be conducted during the 
research program.  The note also underscores the necessity for the 
research vessel, throughout its program, to pay specific attention 
not to harm fishing equipment left in the place within the French 
waters by professional fishermen.  This equipment (cages, nets, 
long-lines) is marked according to current regulations by round red 
buoys but can also be indicated by other various floating markers. 
 
¶3.  (U)  The note also states that the ship must inform French 
authorities of its entrance into and exit from the French waters 
(info to be sent to:  Bureau Emploi Mer/Emia; Tel: 00 33 (0) 5 96 39 
51 64 - Fax: 00 33 (0) 5 96 39 51 65), and inform them should buoys 
be deployed for measurements (position, GDH)). 
 
¶4.  (U)  Finally, the MFA requests three/three copies of both the 
preliminary and post cruise report.
