SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Lebanon Donors' Conference, held in Paris in the 
presence of Secretary Rice and Lebanese PM Siniora, received a fair 
amount of coverage and gave President Chirac personally a publicity 
boost in France, while the rioting prior to Siniora's departure from 
Beirut elicited commentary on Lebanon's prevailing instability and 
the prospects for economic reform.   Commentary on President Bush's 
State of the Union address focused on his Iraq strategy and his 
alleged "inability" to convince Congress -- reaction to his position 
on global warming and the environment was widespread and positive. 
End Summary.

LEBANON DONORS' CONFERENCE 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Right-of-center Le Figaro reported on its front page that 
the "Lebanese opposition was in a tug of war [with the government]" 
and noted that "the crisis, triggered by Hezbollah, was taking place 
two days prior to the Lebanese Donors' Conference."  The report 
further stated that "the conference was not just aiming to salvage 
Lebanon but also to play a preemptive role in the region." 
Right-of-center Le Figaro argued that "Washington and Paris do not 
wish for Siniora to be placed in a difficult economic situation." 
At the close of the conference, right-of-center Le Figaro noted that 
Chirac's conference had been a huge success (highlighting the 
generosity of the U.S. and Saudi Arabia), but lamented that "at the 
very moment of the conference" bloody battles were taking place in 
the Lebanese capital. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Catholic La Croix affirmed that "the conference was off to 
a bad start."  Dominique Quinio held that "Tuesday's strikes and 
demonstrations are setting the tone for the conference."  Quinio 
argued that "while the international community was rushing to the 
bedside of an exhausted Lebanon, it will be taking the temperature 
of the entire region."  Quinio concluded that "once again Lebanon is 
being used by others for interests that did not necessarily concern 
Lebanon, with France wanting to preserve its old influence and the 
U.S. to see Lebanon as a place where it can confront Syria 
indirectly."  Jean Levallois in regional La Presse de La Manche 
agreed: "Between those who see the future of Lebanon through Syrian 
eyes and those who are considering giving part of Lebanon to the 
Palestinians in a bartering exercise, there lie many contradictory 
interests." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Gerard Dupuy concluded in left-wing Liberation that "the 
war with Israel antagonized the various Lebanese factions."  Dupuy 
argued that "unless the Lebanese people find a modus vivendi 
favorable to a climate of trust, all the aid in the world pledged in 
Paris will be for naught."

STATE OF THE UNION

¶5. (SBU) Right-of-center Le Figaro welcomed President Bush's speech 
taking "note of global warming."  Washington correspondent Philippe 
Gelie trumpeted that "although George W. Bush has not turned into a 
crusader against climate change, he was running the risk of becoming 
bogged down at home if he didn't make a gesture on the environment." 
 Left-of-center Le Monde argued in its editorial that the President 
had "devoted most of his speech to domestic issues" and that after 
years of a "rigid stance" on the environment, President Bush had 
"finally accepted the idea of quotas for gas emissions."  In 
right-of-center Le Figaro, Philippe Gelie argued that "the 
President's proposals in matters of energy were not enough to divert 
America from its main concern, Iraq."  But in right-of-center La 
Tribune Pascal Aubert wrote that "although we do not necessarily 
have to believe that President Bush has suddenly dressed in the 
green uniform of crusaders fighting against global warming, he has 
for the first time taken the problem seriously." 
 
¶6. (SBU) A majority of reports focused on the President's plan for 
Iraq.  For Catholic La Croix, "The State of the Union Address did 
not Convince Congress on Iraq."  For right-of-center Le Figaro 
"George Bush Failed to Convince Congress on Iraq."  Left-of-center 
Le Monde argued that President Bush's request that his new plan for 
Iraq "be given a chance" received a "lukewarm" reception and 
Philippe Grangereau in left-wing Liberation concluded that "the 
final chapter of George Bush's presidency was written in this annual 
State of the Union Address, a chapter that promises to be somber." 
 
PARIS 00000317  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
Grangereau closed with the comment that, "in his crusade, George 
Bush is increasingly alone."  Philippe Gelie, in right-of-center Le 
Figaro, shared the same view when he commented: "On all other issues 
President Bush is already a lame duck; on Iraq, he is being attacked 
from all sides and his prerogatives as Commander in Chief are being 
assailed by Congress."
