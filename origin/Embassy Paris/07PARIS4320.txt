REF: SECSTATE 145621 
 
(SBU) MFA Office of Security Affairs and MFA Office of 
Central and East African Affairs have been informed of the 
U.S. proposal to make doing a joint demarche in Asmara per 
reftel regarding non-enforcement of the UN travel ban. 
Although they are not in a position to say immediately 
whether France would participate, they understand the 
urgency.  They request clarification on modalities such as 
the level of participation to be suggested on the U.S. and 
French side, the intended recipient of the demarche and the 
format of the demarche.
