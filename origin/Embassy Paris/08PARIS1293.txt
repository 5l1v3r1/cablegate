MARITIME PATROLS WITH SWEDEN 
 
REF: STATE 69644 
 
(SBU)  In response to reftel demarche on boosting 
humanitarian assistance to Horn of Africa countries, MFA desk 
officer Thierry Caboche said on July 8 that France would 
study the issue and consider ways of increasing French 
contributions, although he noted MFA-wide budget constraints 
and other regions around the world that warranted assistance. 
 Regarding European maritime patrols to protect WFP ships, he 
said that France had performed this duty from November 
2007-January 2008, with Denmark and the Netherlands taking 
over for, respectively, the January-April and April-June 23 
periods.  Caboche said that France was now discussing with 
Sweden the possibility of Sweden's assuming this function.
