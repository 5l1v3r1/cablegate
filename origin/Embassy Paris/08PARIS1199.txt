TEXT UNSCR TO RENEW MANDATE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 66897 
 
¶1. (SBU) MFA Security and Strategic Affairs bureau took on 
board reftel points and text and subsequently informed 
Embassy of three points relating to the preamble, 
notifications and list reviews, all of which were included in 
MFA instructions sent to the French mission to the UN.  The 
GOF wants to include reference to UNSCR 1817 (June 2008), 
relating to trafficking in drug precursors, in the preamble. 
The text touches on precursor and drug trafficking by 
terrorist organizations and the GOF sees this as a 
non-controversial improvement.  On notifications (para 19) 
our interlocutors noted that, on some level, publication of 
the resolution text on the internet constitutes "informing" 
and notifying.  They think that "decides" is too strong an 
obligation with reference to specific, targeted notification, 
given the practical impossibility of reliably making direct 
contact with some relevant players (e.g., Usama Bin-Laden)and 
prefer "calls upon." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Regarding review/revision of the list, they want to 
be more responsive to critics who charge that the 
consolidated list is out of date.  Instead of annual review 
of all entries which have not been updated or reviewed for 
four years (para 26), they propose that the annual review 
encompass all entries that have not been updated or reviewed 
for two/two years.  In addition, they propose a comprehensive 
review of the entire list every two years. MFA contacts 
indicated their UN mission may also raise some pragmatic, 
operational issues, of lesser policy interest.
