AL-BARID, BUT REPRESENTATION AND (UNLIKELY) FINANCIAL 
CONTRIBUTION UNDECIDED 
 
REF: STATE 60216 
 
¶1.  (U)  Embassy passed reftel message on the Vienna 
conference on Nahr al-Barid to the French MFA's equivalent to 
the NEA bureau as well as to the staff of French Cooperation 
Ministeron Alain Joyandet June 9.  The French MFA had already 
publicly saluted the Austrian initiative in a June 5 
statement, indicating that it would attend without specifying 
who would do so or the anticipated size of the French 
contribution. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  During bilateral consultations on NEA issues, 
French MFA NEA DAS-equivalent for the Levant Ludovic Pouille 
confirmed to visiting NEA A/S Welch June 12 that France would 
attend but not at the ministerial level.  Pouille said it 
would be difficult for France to offer a pledge given its 
significant obligations to the Lebanese government under 
Paris III.  France also viewed the situation facing 
Palestinian refugees affected by the fighting at Nahr 
al-Barid and elsewhere in Lebanon primarily in terms of its 
humanitarian and not its political aspects.  Pouille added 
that the GOF wanted the GOL to use the Vienna conference to 
state clearly how it intended to proceed on this issue.
