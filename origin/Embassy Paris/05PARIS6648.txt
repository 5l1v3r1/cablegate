SUBJECT: UNESCO: Cultural Diversity Convention: Should 
USDEL ask for roll-call votes? 
 
REF STATE 179138 
 
¶1.   (U) This requests clarification of paragraph 4 of 
instructions (ref), which asks USDEL to call for votes. 
UNESCO Rule 52 provides that "voting shall normally be 
by show of hands."  UNESCO Rule 53 allows a member 
state to call for a roll-call vote, with the vote of 
each state recorded in the summary proceeding. 
 
¶2.   Please clarify if USDEL should request a roll call 
vote rather than the usual show of hands.
