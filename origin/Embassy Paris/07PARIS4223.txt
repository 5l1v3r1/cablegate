     ¶D. PARIS 775 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy Paris was informed by Embassy Counsel 
Georges Kiejman on the afternoon of October 10 that the Paris 
Tribunal refused parole for convicted terrorist Georges 
Ibrahim Abdallah.  We expect that Abdallah will file an 
appeal with the Paris Court of Appeals within the next ten 
days (the maximum allotted time to file an appeal).  A 
decision by the appeals court would normally be expected 
within several weeks.  The Tribunal's decision also barred 
Abdallah from requesting parole for at least one year (the 
appeal being an exception). 
 
¶2. (SBU) The written court decision indicates that the 
Tribunal refused parole due to (A) the risk that Abdallah 
poses a continuing terrorist threat in Lebanon and/or other 
territories and (B) the "situation of the victims" (based on 
the testimonials provided by Robert Homme and Col. Ray's 
widow). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Abdallah was convicted in 1987 for the 1982 
assassinations in Paris of Embassy Paris' A/DAO Col. Charles 
Ray and Israeli diplomat Yakov Barsimentov, as well as for 
the 1984 attempted killing of US Consul General Strasbourg, 
Robert Homme, outside his official residence.  This is 
Abdallah's fifth request for parole.  All but one were denied 
in the first instance, the other on appeal.  The U.S. 
Government is a civil party to the case.  Post will note our 
appreciation for this update to GOF contacts with whom we 
have raised this case.
