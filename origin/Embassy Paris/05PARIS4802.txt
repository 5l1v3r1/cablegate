SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: USG CANDIDACY FOR SEAT ON 
WORLD HERITAGE COMMITTEE 
 
REF: STATE 122739 
 
¶1. Post delivered a Diplomatic Note to the MFA July 6 per 
reftel instructions.  Poloff provided a copy July 7 to MFA IO 
cultural heritage action officer Claude Gerard. 
 
¶2. Gerard told us July 8 that France had no objection to the 
U.S. candidacy, and would adhere to the usual principle of 
mutual support among P-5 countries.  However, he said, the 
GoF would be interested in further information on the USG 
concept of its role on the Committee, and how we saw the 
Committee functioning.  In short, what does the USG plan to 
accomplish, particularly within the context of the 1972 
administrative convention?  Gerard said that there was an 
"inequality" on the Committee, with some members having 25 or 
more natural and cultural treasures, while others had none. 
The U.S., he offered, was "somewhere in the middle." 
 
¶3. Gerard said that, in addition to being host country, 
France was on the Executive Council.  While there was no 
rule, written or unwritten regarding membership on both the 
Council and the Committee, France felt it would be difficult, 
as a member of the Council, to seek membership of the 
Committee, and had no plans to do so.  Gerard noted that the 
UK was a member of both the Executive Council and the 
Committee, and that the GoF decision not to seek membership 
of the Committee would not preclude French support for the 
USG candidacy.
