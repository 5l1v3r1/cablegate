START MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
Isabel Arnal has long worked with the Prosecutor General of 
Paris, M. Yves Bot, who until recently was the Prosecutor of 
Paris.  She works with M. Bot and with his successor, M. Jean- 
Claude Marin (who was promoted to that post from his prior 
position as Director of the Criminal Division of the French 
Justice Ministry).  These two prosecutors head the most 
powerful prosecutor offices in France, in that the great 
majority of organized crime, financial crime and virtually all 
terrorism prosecutions go through these offices.  So, Ms. 
Arnal works closely with key leaders in the French judicial 
system, where she advises them on international policy and 
participates in significant international law enforcement 
undertakings, such as the G8 Lyon-Roma Group (where she chairs 
the Criminal-Legal Affairs Subgroup) and Eurojust (the EU 
mechanism for integrating prosecution efforts at the EU 
level).  As a result, she can play a role in influencing 
French law enforcement policies, and given her close 
relationship with Bot and Marin, her future advancement in the 
policy structure seems likely. 
In terms of what she would do in the U.S., I would 
particularly want her to see the workings of federal law 
enforcement agencies like FBI and ICE, US Attorney Offices, 
and federal courts, as it will facilitate her understanding of 
how our law enforcement agencies work and therefore how her 
offices can best cooperate with us.  These kinds of visits w 
ill be very useful given that the Paris PG and Prosecutor's 
offices are operational units working on real life organized 
crime, terrorism, drug and financial crime cases.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Ms. Arnal is the advisor on international matters to the 
Prosecutor of Paris, the key prosecution service in France. In 
this position, and as the chairperson of the G8 Lyon and Rana 
Group's subgroup on criminal and legal affairs, she has the 
ability to influence a wide variety of French law enforcement 
officials. It is believed her participation in the IVP would 
promote a favorable view of the U.S. government and the U.S. 
legal system. 
Ms. Arnal can influence key components in the French law 
enforcement establishment with respect to counter-terrorism 
cooperation and combating of international crime. Thus, she 
could assist in implementation of the counter-terrorism and 
global affairs MPP goals and objectives.
