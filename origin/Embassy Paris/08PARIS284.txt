Â¶1. (U) Embassy contacted Major Karin Sonier of Flotte 
Transport Ecoles, Simmad Base Aerienne 217, the end 
user (Tel:  +33-1-69-23-86-40; 
fte.simmad@inet.air.defense.gouv.fr).  She confirmed 
that the Portugese firm OGMA Industria Aeronautica is 
the base's sole supplier of C-130 parts and 
accessories.  The intermediary consignees (AD-S and 
Co. and KDS Cargo BV) are simply logistics providers, 
she said.  In the absence of contract or order 
references, she said she could not confirm the 
arrival of any consignments of C-130 parts and 
accessories.  However, she would be happy to do so if 
needed, provided the USG furnishes the relevant 
references.
