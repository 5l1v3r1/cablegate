¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: France is on the same page as the United 
States with respect to country-specific and thematic 
resolutions for the UNGA Third Committee and seeks USG 
support for French sponsored initiatives, stated MFA desk 
officer for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs Cecile 
Vigneau, who spoke to poloff on October 27 in response to 
reftel demarche. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) France is ready and willing to engage with the U.S. 
in order to assure a productive Third Committee session in 
the 64th UNGA, according to MFA Assistant Director for Human 
Rights and Humanitarian Affairs Cecile Vigneau.  In regards 
to the country-specific resolutions, Vigneau said that France 
is absolutely in support of the EU's annual resolutions on 
human rights in Burma and the DPRK, thanking us for helping 
to bring attention to these issues of mutual interest.  She 
also noted that the GOF fully supports Canada's annual 
resolution on the human rights situation in Iran but wishes 
to see the finalized text.  Vigneau confirmed that France 
shares our concerns on the Defamation of Religions resolution 
and that the GOF is in full agreement with the U.S. on the 
need to defer or defeat it at UNGA. Regarding the resolution 
on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, Vigneau 
explained that France was actively involved in sponsoring the 
resolution at the European Union level and now strongly 
promotes the work of leads Colombia and Mexico on the issue. 
She remarked that the French viewpoint on the U.S.-backed 
Elections resolution would be best discussed by her 
colleagues in New York. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Vigneau expressed appreciation for U.S. willingness 
to engage on the EU and the Group of Latin American and 
Caribbean countries (GRULAC) jointly co-sponsored annual 
resolution on the Rights of the Child. She commented that the 
specific text of the resolution is currently being debated 
amongst the EU member states and that the Swedes will be 
taking the lead on the issue in New York. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Describing the issue of religious discrimination as 
a particularly challenging topic for UNGA discussion, Vigneau 
solicited our support on the EU resolution on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on 
Religious Beliefs, which she said needed the full endorsement 
of the U.S. and other influential states to win ratification. 
 She urged the U.S. to reconsider the not-yet-into-force 
French-Argentian sponsored International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, which 
remains seven signatures short of implementation.  France 
will also introduce a French-Brazilian drafted resolution on 
the Elimination of Violence Against Women meant to protect 
women against all forms of violence, including sexual 
violence.
