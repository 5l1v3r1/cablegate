Paris to Host AI Conference 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On June 29-30, the Pasteur Institute will host the 
'First International Conference on Avian Influenza in 
Humans.'  The aim of the conference is to bring together 
world specialists to discuss the latest advances on avian 
influenza, particularly on new therapeutic targets for 
treatment and prevention in humans, and the strategies to 
avoid a human pandemic.  A special session will be reserved 
to discuss how to manage a catastrophic scenario in the 
event of a pandemic.  For more information or to register

Freedom for Poultry 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  Domestic poultry confined in the French department of 
Ain will soon be set free, announced the government earlier 
this week.  Domestic poultry had been confined indoors 
since February, when H5N1 contaminated wild birds in the 
region somehow infected a turkey farm. Although the poultry 
will be allowed out of confinement, they will still be 
subject to strict oversight.

France the Best Prepared 
------------------------ 
 
¶4.  According to a recent study from the London School of 
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, France is considered the 
country the best prepared in the event of an avian 
influenza pandemic.  The study was financed by Roche Labs, 
the maker of Tamiflu, and was publicized yesterday in the 
Wall Street Journal.  The study analyzed the preparation of 
21 European countries according to 169 criteria established 
by WHO.
