SUBJECT: FRANCE: DEMARCHE IN ADVANCE OF INTERNATIONAL 
MARITIME ORGANIZATION'S MARITIME SAFETY COMMITTEE MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 183434 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche November 16 to 
Eric Berder, Ministry of Transportation Deputy Director for 
Maritime Safety.  Berder noted that the EU had developed a 
common position on the issue, to which France adhered.  They 
viewed the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the 
International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO) as having 
fundamentally different roles: the IMO as regulator, and IMSO 
as properly charged with technical coordination.  He said 
this had been expressed in a Spanish proposal adopted at a 
previous meeting of the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), and 
felt that the U.S. proposal to have the IMO take on 
coordinating responsibilities for the Long Range 
Identification and Tracking program (LRIT) ran contrary to 
this decision. IMSO could be strengthened if necessary to 
execute these responsibilities. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Berder took particular note of our argument that 
IMSO did not have the legal authority to perform these 
responsibilities at present and the likely delays that 
acquiring this would entail. He had not heard this point 
raised before. However, he believed that the recent amendment 
to the IMSO convention gave it sufficient legal authority to 
play such a role. He said he would pass our points to the GOF 
representative in London who follows IMO affairs.
