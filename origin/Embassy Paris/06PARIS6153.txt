¶1.  (SBU) FM Douste-Blazy cabinet advisor Francois-Xavier 
Carrel-Billiard told us September 13 that FM Douste-Blazy at 
this time planned to attend the September 22 informal 
transatlantic lunch hosted by the Secretary, and would also 
attend the U.S.-EU ministerial meeting following.  New 
Political Director Gerard Araud would replace Douste-Blazy if 
for any reason Douste-Blazy could not attend. 
Carrel-Billiard asked if the U.S. would reconsider holding 
the meeting in French and English, making the argument that 
this had been the case for similar lunches in Sofia and 
Brussels.  Otherwise Douste-Blazy would have to have an 
interpreter with him (Claire Keefe), which would add to the 
number of participants. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Speaking more generally about France's UNGA 
participation, Carrel-Billiard said President Chirac would be 
present September 18 and 19, and possibly part of September 
20, although he was unable to confirm that.  Other members of 
the delegation, besides Foreign Minister Douste-Blazy, 
included Political Director Araud, Policy Planning Director 
Pierre Levy, and (we assume) IO Director Sylvie Bermann.  We 
noted our understanding that NEA A/S Welch would have a 
separate meeting with Araud on the Middle East, and queried 
as to the best interlocutor on Cuba transition for U/S 
Dobriansky.  Carrel-Billiard suggested that Levy as the best 
choice, since Cuba transition included democracy writ large. 
We undertook to pass the suggestion to Washington.
