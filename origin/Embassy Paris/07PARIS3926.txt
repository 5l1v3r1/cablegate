(SBU)  We carried out reftel demarche on September 19 with 
MFA IO desk officer Emmanuel Pineda, who was familiar with 
the planned meeting of the Community of Democracies on the 
margins of the UNGA on October 1.  He expressed general 
agreement with the U.S. approach and indicated GOF engagement 
on CD issues and at the October 1 meeting, but said that he 
would offer comments at a later stage after further studying 
some of the specific points made in reftel.
