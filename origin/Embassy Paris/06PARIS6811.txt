 ¶1.  (SBU) Embassy officers have completed a series of 
meetings with Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Commerce and 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials regarding France,s 
Copyright law (ref A).  French officials reiterated that they 
welcomed U.S. government and industry input regarding the 
implementation of the new technical regulatory Authority as 
called for in the law (ref B).  We understand the French 
government plans on establishing the new Authority by the end 
of 2006, though some local observers doubt this timetable is 
achievable. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Culture Ministry officials Martin Rogard and Marc 
Herubel 
(Herubel is a member of Minister de Vabre,s cabinet and has 
the lead on this issue for the French government) stated that 
following inter-ministerial consultations, a decree will be 
finalized by mid-November defining the powers and scope of 
the proposed "Regulatory Authority for Technical Measures" as 
required by the law.  The Culture Ministry plans on having 
the new Authority up and running by the end of the year.  It 
will reportedly be modeled largely on France,s existing 
Competition Authority, an independent agency which was 
created in 1986.  The Competition Authority, which has 
sanctions powers, has been particularly active in 
liberalizing France,s telecommunications market. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Ministry of Foreign Trade Deputy Chief of Staff 
Etienne Oudot de Dainville was less certain about the 
proposed timetable and noted that the Trade Ministry had not 
yet contributed to inter-ministerial discussions on the 
proposed Authority.  Outside of government, copyright lawyers 
active on behalf of U.S. industry believe the Authority will 
favor protection of copyrights and Digital Rights Management 
technologies, to the extent permitted by the new law.  These 
lawyers doubt however that the Authority will be in place by 
the end of the year.  If the timetable slips, upcoming 
Presidential elections in 2007 may have a considerable impact 
on implementation of the law. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  All of our interlocutors welcomed U.S. 
comments and input (particularly from U.S. industry) 
concerning the new Authority during the short time remaining 
prior to issuance of the planned decree.  Commerce U/S 
Lavin,s visit to Paris October 18-20 will provide an 
opportunity to underscore U.S. concerns with copyright law 
implementation.
