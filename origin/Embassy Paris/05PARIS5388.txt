¶1. (U) Embassy Paris has concentrated recent public outreach 
on Guantanamo issues in two areas.  The Guantanamo detainee 
issue is a part of regular conversations Mission officers 
have with private and public interlocutors, and we use the 
talking points at each of these occasions. We also respond 
to each letter or petition received from the French public. 
The Mission receives on average some twenty letters a month 
on detainee and Guantanamo issues.  The Public Affairs 
Section, which oversees the responses, has incorporated 
several of the reftel talking points into the text of its 
new letter.  We are using the new text to respond to the 
French chapter of Amnesty International's recent letter to 
the Ambassador, for example.  That letter asks the Mission 
to forward a petition, signed by 12,000 people, against 
torture and degrading treatment of detainees to the 
President. 
 
¶2. (SBU) GOF interest in Guantanamo has been largely 
confined to the presence of French citizens.  With the 
already completed transfer in 2005 of all French citizens 
from Guantanamo, we anticipate little official reaction from 
the GOF on this issue.
