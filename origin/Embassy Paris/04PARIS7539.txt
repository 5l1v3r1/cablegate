(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Jeanne de Tarle, 
MFA UN Desk Officer covering the Caribbean; Eric Chaux, MFA 
Cuba Desk Officer; and Christophe Katsahian, U.S. Desk 
Officer, on October 13.  De Tarle underlined that the GOF 
shared our overall assessment of the human rights situation 
in Cuba.  She added that France follows the human rights 
situation closely and would continue to do so, but that 
France's history of voting for the resolution against the 
embargo was unlikely to change.  De Tarle emphasized that an 
affirmative vote on the resolution was not a show of support 
for the Castro regime, but rather a position taken on 
principle, and, she said, the GOF considers the embargo an 
ineffective way of bringing about democratic change in Cuba. 
While it is probable that the GOF will vote with other EU 
countries in support of the resolution, de Tarle indicated 
that there would likely be a strongly worded Explanation of 
Vote to voice EU concern with the continued human rights 
abuses of the Castro regime.
