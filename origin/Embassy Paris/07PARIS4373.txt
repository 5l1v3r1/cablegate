Lepine-Kouas, French MFA desk officer for Bolivia on October 
¶26.  Poloff stressed U.S. concern over Bolivia's support of 
Iran's nuclear program, and provided the GOF with a text of 
Chocquehuanc's statements.  Lepine-Kouas said the GOF had not 
taken note of the Iran/Bolivia joint statement on September 
27 or Foreign Minister Chocquehuanc's comments and, therefore 
had no immediate substantive comment.
