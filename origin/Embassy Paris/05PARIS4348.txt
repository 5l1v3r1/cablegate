SUBJECT: DEMARCHE REQUEST: JOINT APPROACH IN PRESSING GOA 
FOR RESOLUTION OF MSF KILLINGS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 112202 
 
Reftel demarche was delivered to MFA Afghanistan desk 
officer, Cyril Gerardon, and South Asia regional director 
Anne Grillo-Nebout on June 16 and 17.  On June 17 poloff 
suggested to Gerardon that, even in light of the recent 
arrest in connection with the MSF murders, a joint demarche 
could still be appropriate.  Gerardon said that the GOF was 
pleased with news of the arrest of the Qadis district police 
chief and would be paying attention to how the GOA would 
handle the case as it proceeds.  He said he would look at the 
reftel talking points in further detail and consult with 
others at the MFA on the subject.
