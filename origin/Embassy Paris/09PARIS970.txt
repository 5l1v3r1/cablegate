SUBJECT: DOMESTIC BRIEFING PAPER: SARKOZY RESHUFFLES 
CABINET WITH EYE TOWARD FUTURE ELECTIONS 
 
PARIS 00000970  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) President Sarkozy appointed an eclectic combination 
of close UMP allies and new centrist recruits to the Fillon 
government June 23 in an apparent effort to boost his appeal 
among a broad range of voters before regional elections next 
year and a presumed reelection bid in 2012.  At least two 
changes to the government lineup were required given the 
election of former ministers Michel Barnier and Rachida Dati 
to the European Parliament earlier in the month.  But the 
June 23 government reshuffle went further than most observers 
expected, even though Prime Minister Francois Fillon and the 
incumbents at other strategic ministries*defense, foreign 
affairs, environment and economy*stayed on in their 
positions.  In the days following the reshuffle, President 
Sarkozy also hinted publicly he might appoint more allies to 
the Fillon government before the end of the summer. 
 
¶2. (SBU) After taking considerable heat from some in the UMP 
for appointing &too many8 center-left personalities to 
cabinet slots, President Sarkozy shored up his right flank in 
this reshuffling by promoting several sitting UMP ministers 
to higher positions and by nominating fresh faces from within 
the party.  Michele Alliot-Marie, a member of the UMP,s 
Gaullist wing, replaced Dati at the important Justice 
Ministry.  She was also promoted to the prestigious Minister 
of State rank, placing her third in the government,s 
protocol order.  Brice Hortefeux, the president,s oldest 
political ally, took over from Alliot-Marie at Interior and 
Xavier Darcos, another Sarkozy UMP stalwart, replaced 
Hortefeux at Labor. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Luc Chatel, a fortyish UMP rising star was promoted 
from the State Secretary for Industry slot to the politically 
sensitive Minister of Education position.  Chatel also 
retained his high-profile Government Spokesman designation. 
Bruno Le Maire, formerly State Secretary for European 
Affairs, was named Minister of Agriculture, and Nice Mayor 
Christian Estrosi, another long-time Sarkozy ally, entered 
the government as Chatel,s replacement.  Also new to the 
government lineup: Pierre Lellouche, the well-known 
Atlanticist deputy and former SR for Afghanistan and 
Pakistan, was named to lead the European Affairs portfolio; 
freshman UMP deputy Benoist Apparu became State Secretary for 
Housing; and presidential assistant Marie-Luce Penchard, the 
daughter of a powerful UMP senator from Guadeloupe, took up 
duties as State Secretary for Overseas Affairs. 
 
¶4. (SBU) After crediting the UMP,s larger-than-expected 
margin of victory in the European Elections to his 
controversial &overture8 policy, Sarkozy also continued his 
outreach to certain strategic personalities on the 
center-left.  Senator Michel Mercier, one of centrist 
Francois Bayrou,s top lieutenants, was named to the newly 
created Minister of Rural Development post.  Bayrou,s MoDem 
party was smothered in the European Parliament elections, 
placing a distant fourth behind the UMP, PS and Greens. 
Mercier,s appointment to the Fillon government was 
characterized by the press as an effort by President Sarkozy 
to further destabilize the shell-shocked Bayrou, a likely 
presidential contender in 2012. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In perhaps the reshuffle,s most surprising 
nomination, Frederic Mitterrand, a nephew of the former 
president, was named Minister of Culture and Communication. 
Although press reports later revealed Mitterrand had voted 
for Jacques Chirac in 1995 and was a close friend to First 
Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, Mitterrand,s appointment was 
initially characterized as an effort by Sarkozy to co-opt an 
iconic family name from the Socialists.  In another example 
of his commitment to the overture policy, President Sarkozy 
also named Jean-Marie Bockel, leader of the Modern Left party 
and the former State Secretary for Veterans Affairs, to the 
newly created State Secretary for Justice Affairs position. 
While Bockel,s exact portfolio has yet to be defined, he is 
reportedly expected to lead a reform of the French prison 
system, one of President Sarkozy,s top priorities for the 
coming year. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: President Sarkozy continued his outreach to 
members of the center-left as part of this reshuffle, but 
also reserved the lion,s share of new appointments for 
members of his own party.  With his UMP allies now appeased, 
President Sarkozy may feel more at liberty to build a broad 
coalition with other parties*namely Bockel,s Modern Left 
and Defense Minister Herve Morin,s New Center*in an effort 
to win the March 2010 regional elections.  Looking further 
down the road, and given the overall gloomy economic outlook 
for the foreseeable future, President Sarkozy likely sees his 
controversial &overture8 policy as an essential element to 
winning reelection in 2012.
