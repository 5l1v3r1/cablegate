¶1.  (U) This cable is Sensitive but Unclassified - not for 
internet distribution. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Embassy delivered reftel demarche to both the 
Strategic Affairs/ Non-proliferation and the United Nations 
bureaus at the French MFA.  Our interlocuters were unfamiliar 
with the South African and Indonesian proposal to delete the 
text regarding posting the 1540 matrices online in the draft 
letters destined to be sent to States by the UN Security 
Council Committee established pursuant to UNSCR 1540. 
However, they appreciated our raising the issue and promised 
to take it under advisement.
