SUBJECT: FRANCE PRAISES U.S. TRANSPERENCY IN DRAFT DECISION 
TO EXTEND DESTRUCTION DEADLINE, SEES NO PROBLEM WITH VISITS 
 
REF: STATE 95633 
 
¶1.  (U) Poloff delivered talking points June 16 to Chemical 
Weapons Convention (CWC) action officer, Etienne Sur.  In a 
follow-up conversation June 19, Sur said that the GoF was 
pleased with the language in the U.S. Request for 
establishment of a revised date for the final deadline for 
destruction of its Category 1 chemical weapons.  France, he 
explained, had been concerned that any legal leeway given to 
the U.S. would be exploited by other countries that have been 
less responsible in safeguarding and destroying their 
chemical arsenals.  Sur said that the GoF was particularly 
pleased with subparagraph (a) of the recommendations, which 
clearly states that the decision to establish a revised date 
should in no way affect the U.S. obligation to destroy all 
its Category 1 chemical weapons no later than 15 years after 
the entry into force of the Convention. 
 
¶2.  (U) As regards visits, Sur said that GoF representatives 
had discussed the matter with Germany and the UK.  Both, he 
said were pushing for visits to have a political as well as a 
technical aspect to them.  France, he said, cared only that 
the Executive Council be kept informed as to the political 
dimensions of the issue, and was not adamant that each visit 
include a distinct political element.
