DEME 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  Senegal  new Ambassador to UNESCO, Amadou Deme, 
paid a courtesy call on Ambassador Oliver today, June 30th.  The two 
Ambassadors discussed the need to work closely together to advance 
UNESCO  capabilities to provide effective programs for Africa 
through all of UNESCO  sectors.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Ambassador Deme, 63, is a senior career diplomat with the 
Senegalese Foreign Ministry, who previously served at UNESCO from 
1988-92, as well as in Mali, China, Guinea Conakry, Tokyo, Lagos, 
Ottawa and at the UN in New York. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ambassador Oliver told Deme that this biennium is critical 
for UNESCO, as it is the moment when priorities will be set for the 
coming medium-term strategy.  She also said that given the fact that 
this is the Director General  last term, it is important to take 
action to ensure that the quality of programs be strengthened and 
that difficult work, including the restructuring of the education 
and science sectors, be accomplished while UNESCO  Secretariat 
remains focused and effective. 
 
¶4. (SBU) During their conversation, Ambassador Deme mentioned that 
the members of the Africa Group, (Group V (a)), had requested and 
met with all of UNESCO  Assistant Directors General (ADG) last 
Friday, June 23rd, for a briefing and to get updates on their plans 
regarding the C/4 and C/5 (strategy and budget programs).  While he 
did not share specifics about the meeting, he did say that the 
Africa Group would meet with the ADG  again before the end of the 
year. 
 
¶5. (U) Ambassador Oliver also spoke of the need to work closely 
together to make sure that UNESCO  programs, across all sectors, be 
coherent, focused and of the highest quality possible.  Adding that 
this is a moment of opportunity for UNESCO, Ambassador Oliver 
stressed that we cannot afford to lose valuable time.  Given the 
fact that Africa  countries are among the primary beneficiaries of 
so much of UNESCO  work, the Ambassador asked that Senegal support 
the needed management changes underway to help improve 
UNESCO 
effectiveness. 
 
¶6. (U) Ambassador Oliver talked about the First Lady  upcoming 
conference on literacy in September, and mentioned that UNESCO would 
probably be organizing a series of follow-up regional conferences, 
one of which would probably be in Africa. 
 
¶7. (U) Ambassador Deme said that he does not want  riority Africa 
used as a slogan at UNESCO, but rather he and the other Africans 
want to be able to have UNESCO develop results-oriented programs 
that help them solve the problems facing the continent.  In 
particular, Ambassador Deme mentioned his desire to close the gap 
regarding the problems of poverty and education, and wants to use 
UNESCO  capacity building skills to that end. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Ambassador Oliver agreed, saying that often UNESCO programs 
had previously failed in the past because of the lack of emphasis on 
capacity building.  The goal for the future is to make sure that 
capacity building is built into all of UNESCO  planning for the 
future, so that knowledge and skills are left behind after the 
experts leave.
