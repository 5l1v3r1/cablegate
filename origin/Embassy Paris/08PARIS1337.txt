¶1.  (SBU)  In response to ref A, MFA Horn of Africa Desk 
Officer Thierry Caboche reviewed assistance France has been 
providing to Africa (refs B-C), particularly France's 
engagement in naval patrols to counter piracy in the Horn of 
Africa and its efforts to engage Denmark, the Netherlands, 
and Sweden in this activity. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Caboche noted that France and Spain had initiated 
a project within the EU to implement further UNSCR 1816, with 
discussions on-going in Brussels.  The goal of the project 
would be to establish an EU mission that would engage in 
anti-piracy operations near Somalia.  Caboche said that the 
GOF had informed the USG (Department, NSC, DOD) of this 
initiative via France's Washington Embassy, and that it would 
continue to do so as the project evolved.
