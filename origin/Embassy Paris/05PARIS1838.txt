SUBJECT: FRENCH FOLLOW-UP ON BRITISH REQUEST FOR 
COUNTERNARCOTICS CONTRIBUTIONS TO AFGHANISTAN 
 
REF: SECSTATE 39676 
 
We learned from the British Embassy in Paris that they had 
faxed Foreign Minister Straw's letter to the French MFA's 
Anti-Drug Policy Coordinator; the MFA head of Department for 
Narcotics; the MFA cabinet and the South Asia desk.  We 
delivered reftel points to these same offices March 10 and 
March 14.  Ambassador Vidon, the French Drug Policy 
Coordinator, and Cyril Gerardon, the Desk Officer for 
Afghanistan, each confirmed that the British letter was 
delivered in late February/early March.  Gerardon said that 
it is too early to tell what the French contribution, if any, 
to the trust fund will be, but he noted that the French 
recognize the importance of combating the growing drug 
problem in Afghanistan.
