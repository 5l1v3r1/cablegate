¶1.  (U) POL Deputy delivered ref A demarche May 23 to MFA 
Bureau of International Organizations Affairs PDAS-equivalent 
Marc Giacomini, stressing the U.S. preference for delaying a 
vote on a China-sponsored resolution pending negotiation 
between China and Taiwan of a mutually acceptable solution 
that would allow both countries to participate fully in the 
OIE. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Giacomini responded that a delay as envisioned by 
the U.S. would be the ideal solution.  At the same time, he 
judged it improbable.  He said it would be necessary to 
persuade the OIE presidency of the desirability of a delay 
(without saying so, he implied that this might be difficult). 
 And citing Chinese impatience to move forward, he suggested 
that the PRC might well insist on an early vote on the 
resolution in any case. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Asked about the status of EU deliberations, 
Giacomini stated that discussions would be held the afternoon 
of May 23.  He was not optimistic that the EU would reach 
consensus, saying its position would in all likelihood remain 
"open," i.e., there would be no common position, and member 
states would be free to differ.  When queried as to France's 
position, Giacomini responded that France "would await the 
results of the debate."  POL Deputy asked if French 
indecisiveness was the result of a lacking instructions in 
the wake of the recent change of government; Giacomini said 
this was not the case.  Giacomini suggested that it might be 
possible for the EU to issue a declaration even in the 
absence of an agreed position, although, on reflection, he 
admitted this would be unusual. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Giacomini asked how the U.S. would vote if push 
came to shove China forced a vote.  POL Deputy responded that 
his instructions did not cover that contingency.  Giacomini 
indicated that France "would not vote against the (Chinese) 
resolution." 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Giacomini indicated his willingness to remain in 
contact as consideration of the issue continued.  POL Deputy 
undertook to provide him with a copy of the U.S. non-paper to 
ensure his full appreciation of our position. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) We have been approached repeatedly by the Taiwanese 
Representation, which is fully briefed on the issue,and we 
have informed them on the substance of the French position.
