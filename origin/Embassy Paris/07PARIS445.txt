SUBJECT: WHO RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE UN COMMISSION ON 
NARCOTIC DRUGS (CND) TO CHANGE CONTROLS ON SYNTHETIC THC 
(DRONABINOL): FRENCH REPONSE 
 
REF: (06) SECSTATE 195365 
 
¶1. Embassy science officer delivered demarche in REFTEL to 
Emmanuel Jean, Head of European and International Affairs at 
the French Ministry of Health, on 11 December 2006.  Ms. Jean 
referred the demarche to AFSSAPS, the French agency for the 
sanitary security of health products, which is responsible in 
the French government for classifying Dronabinol.  Embassy 
followed up with Ms. Jean on 30 January. 
 
¶2. AFSSAPS reports that the question of changing the statute 
for Dronabinol will be examined by the National Commission on 
Depressants and Psychotropic Drugs at the end of February 
¶2007.  In 2003, the Commission had examined the WHO's 
proposal to transfer the Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol from 
Schedule II to Schedule IV of the Convention of 1971.  The 
Commission considered that: the therapeutic interests of 
Delta-9-THC was limited and that its potential for abuse and 
dependence was recognized.  In effect, the Commission was not 
in favor of the transfer.  AFSSAPS will inform the Embassy of 
its conclusions on dronabinol when they become available.
