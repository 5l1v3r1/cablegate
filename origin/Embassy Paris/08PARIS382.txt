¶1.  The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Attache, 
Paris, France requests the assistance of the Regional Security 
Office, Nouakchott, Mauritania in support of the investigation of 
Samba SALL, an asylee in the U.S. who may have misrepresented his 
former occupation in Mauritania.  If these misrepresentations are 
proven, SALL may be subject to removal/deportation proceedings in 
the U.S. 
 
¶2.  SALL is identified as follows: 
 
NAME: Samba SALL 
DOB: 03/04/1947 
POB: Kaedi, Mauritania 
SEX:    Male 
A# : 075 259 380 
 
¶3.  Samba SALL entered the United States without inspection and was 
granted asylum by an immigration judge on 05/21/2003.  SALL then 
filed an application to adjust status to permanent residence (Form 
I-485).  During his adjustment interview with Citizenship and 
Immigration Services on 05/08/2007, SALL claimed to have been a 
farmer in Mauritania.  However, the interviewing officer developed 
information indicating that SALL may have been a Police Commissioner 
in Mauritania. 
 
¶4.  In furtherance of this investigation, it is respectfully 
requested that the RSO Nouakchott attempt to determine if Samba SALL 
was indeed employed as a Police Commissioner, or as a public 
official in any capacity while residing in Mauritania.  DS/CR/CIL 
concurrence for assistance is respectfully requested. 
 
¶5.  Digital images and additional identifiers relating to SALL can 
be provided to post under separate cover. 
 
¶6. Please reference ICE Attache Paris case number PA17G408CU0003 in 
any correspondence. 
 
¶7.  Point of contact: Assistant ICE Attache Richard Jolles, 2 Avenue 
Gabriel # A-225, 75008 Paris, France. Telephone: 33-1-4312-2371; 
fax: 33-1-4562-3639. 
 
¶8.  Thank you for your assistance.
