SUBJECT: FRANCE: CI/KR RESPONSE FOR S/CT 
 
REF: STATE 06461 
 
¶1. After mission-wide consultation, Embassy Paris did not 
identify any physical infrastructure or resources in France 
whose loss would immediately affect the security, national 
economic security, and/or national public health or safety of 
the United States.  Our CI/KR report is therefore negative. 
 
¶2. GOF ACTIONS TO PROTECT CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE:  Critical 
infrastructure protection is a high priority for France, with 
particular attention paid to airports, seaports, public 
transit systems, and nuclear reactors.  The GOF, under the 
auspices of the Interior Ministry, developed a national 
security plan in 1978 known as Vigipirate to respond to 
terrorist threats.  Vigipirate consists of four threat 
levels, each of which activates certain protocols aimed at 
reinforcing security, including critical infrastructure.  The 
evaluation of possible threats is updated regularly.  Both 
the national police and the military assist in security, as 
appropriate.  The GOF also has specialized plans in place to 
deal with specific threats, such as chemical or biological 
attacks. 
 
¶3. The Vigipirate system consists of four threat levels: (1) 
Yellow:  Emphasize vigilance against real but indefinite 
threats using localized measures;  (2) Orange:  Warning of a 
possible terrorist attack; preparation for higher threat 
level;  (3) Red:  Known risk of one or several serious 
attacks; put in place necessary emergency and counter-attack 
measures;  (4) Scarlet:  Known risk of major attacks, 
possibly simultaneous, and could cause disastrous effects; 
all necessary security measures must be taken. 
 
¶4. France has been operating at threat level Red since the 
London bombings on July 7, 2005.
