 Â¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche November 22 to 
Nicole Taillefer, Head of the Energy, Transport and 
Infrastructure Department in the MFA's Economics Directorate. 
 She was unaware of any Government of Afghanistan request for 
support in transportation of Hajjis, but said she would 
follow up with other departments in the MFA. Her comments 
were echoed by MFA Afghanistan desk officer  Pierre Fournier 
in a November 28 discussion with Poloff.  Fournier did not 
think the GOF had been approached yet, but he had raised the 
issue with the French Embassy in Kabul and was waiting for a 
response.  Post will report any further response we receive.
