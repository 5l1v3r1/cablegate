SUBJECT: FRENCH REPRESENTATION AT UPCOMING NPT-RELATED 
MEETINGS 
 
REF: STATE 102585 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel, MFA NPT desk officer Arnaud 
Mentre told us July 26 upcoming NPT-related meetings would be 
attended by their relevant Ambassadors.  However, the 
policymaking and preparation lead will remain in Paris. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) For the IAEA meetings in September, Francois-Xavier 
Deniau, French representative at IAEA, is the likely head of 
delegation.  Jean-Francois Dobelle, French representative at 
the Conference on Disarmament, will likely be the head of 
delegation for the First Committee meeting in October and for 
the 2008 PrepCom, though a formal decision will not be made 
on PrepCom delegation leadership until January. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Although Deniau and Dobelle would be the 
appropriate participants in any side meetings, any 
consultations taking place prior to the meetings should be 
with the responsible parties at the MFA:  Philippe Carre, 
A/S-equivalent for Strategic Affairs, and his DAS-equivalent 
for Disarmament and Nuclear Nonproliferation, Martin Briens. 
Briens replaced Philippe Errera in that role in May.
