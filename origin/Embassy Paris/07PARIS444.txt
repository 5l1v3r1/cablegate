¶1.  U.S. Consul at Embassy's subsidiary American Presence 
Post in Toulouse, France met with ORFAGEN President Patrick 
Dupuy on 1 February in response to request in referenced 
telegram.  Consul confirms that a spin-off of Pierre Fabre 
Laboratories, ORFAGEN, specializes in developing 
dermatological treatments for rare conditions.  The company 
works closely with laboratories in the U.S., especially at 
U.S. research universities, as well as with Pierre Fabre 
researchers to develop its specialty products, although it 
retains "ownership" of products.  ORFAGEN plans to establish 
a U.S. subsidiary in Vermont or New Jersey, employing 
approximately fifteen people.  The staff at its Toulouse 
office are primarily pharmacists, two of whom plan to travel 
to Baltimore at the end of February in connection with the 
subject project.  Mr. Dupuy expressed considerable interest 
in the FDA grant. 
 
¶2.  Embassy sees no objection from a foreign policy 
perspective to the provision of this award to ORFAGEN.
