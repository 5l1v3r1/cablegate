SUBJECT: FRANCE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH REVISED TERMS OF 
REFERENCE FOR THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE, NOTES CONSENSUS MUST 
 
BE MADE 
 
REF: STATE 030313 
 
We delivered reftel points to French MFA Office for 
Disarmament and Nuclear Nonproliferation on February 22.  On 
February 25 poloff spoke with Hugues de Longevialle from that 
office.  De Longevialle said that the new terms of reference 
look to be an improvement over the ones he had seen 
previously.  He said that while he and his colleagues have 
not had adequate time to go through the points in detail, the 
new terms of reference appear to be constructive and noted 
with gratitude that Washington seemed tuned to their original 
concerns.  He added that the terms will need to be discussed 
in detail in Vienna where the BOG must come to a consensus 
noting that the original French concerns will remain -- they 
do not want to see the Special Committee become a substitute 
for effective mechanisms that are already in place.  He 
noted, however, that the Special Committee, as portrayed in 
the new terms of reference, appear to provide a means to 
improve and augment the existing system rather than displace 
it.
