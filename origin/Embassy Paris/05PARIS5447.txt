(SBU) On 10 August, Econ Counselor passed reftel points to 
Finance Ministry Office Director for African, Caribbean, and 
Pacific Affairs, Remy Rioux (who will participate on the 11 
August IMF conference call) and discussed the IGOH financing 
gap with him.  Rioux said he completely understood the USG 
position and noted that France shares the USG's sense of 
urgency.  Nevertheless, he noted that the timing for further 
disbursements (at least in the first half of FY06) was "not 
propitious" for France.  The GOF was juggling other 
priorities and the situation is, Rioux explained, a bit 
"delicate."  He explained that he was personally reviewing 
the upcoming schedule of disbursements in preparation for the 
conference call (in fact he appeared to be the only employee 
in the entire office).  He said he was looking for any 
flexibility the GOF might have.  Rioux noted that he had not 
finished examining these numbers and that he hoped to have 
completely reviewed them in time for the 11 August call. 
PolOff also shared reftel points with Dominique Pradet, Haiti 
desk officer at the MFA.  She was unable to give a 
substantive response but noted the USG's position.
