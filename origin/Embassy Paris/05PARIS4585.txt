REF: STATE 114687 
 
   ¶1.  Econ Officer contacted France's Electronic 
   Communications and Postal Services Authority (ARCEP) on 
   June 22 to obtain information requested in reftel 
   regarding French licensing practices for fixed services. 
 
   ¶2.  On June 28, ARCEP Director for International Affairs 
   Anne Lenfant responded by explaining that, according to 
   French law (Article L. 33-1 m of the Code of Posts and 
   Electronic Communications), licensing fees cover 
   administrative costs.  More specifically, she said, 
   licensing fees are as follows: 10,000 Euros for regional 
   offers within France; 20,000 Euros for national offers, 
   and 80,000 euros for significant market power operators. 
   There are no administrative fees related to 
   experimentations. 
 
   ¶3.  As for the other two questions raised in reftel, 
   ARCEP confirmed that there are no requirements for 
   capitalization, bonding, or built-out investment.
