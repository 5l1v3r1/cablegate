BURMA - DEMARCHE DELIVERED TO FRENCH 
 
REF: SECSTATE 43425 
 
¶1.  On March 21, ESTH Counselor and Science Affairs 
Specialist delivered reftel demarche to the French MFA 
Burma/Thailand desk officer Franck Vermeulen and Ambassador 
for Avian Influenza Preparedness Jean Garbe.  Vermeulen 
stated that France has no bilateral assistance programs with 
Burma and it has received no request from the Burmese for 
technical assistance in dealing with avian influenza. 
France's official presence in Burma is limited and no Pasteur 
Institute affiliate institute operates there.  If any action 
is envisaged by Burmese authorities, the appropriate channel 
for assistance would be the European Union.  To Vermeulen's 
understanding, no request for help from Burma has been made 
to EU authorities. 
 
¶2.  Vermeulen said that the Burmese handling of avian 
influenza is "inspired by" the Thai model, and that 
cooperation with WHO appears satisfactory.  Referring to the 
military regime in Burma, Vermeulen commented that the 
presence of government representatives in each village 
generates control and reporting on bird health issues.  He 
noted, however, that this was not the case in areas not fully 
under Burmese government control.  Vermeulen commented that 
during the tsunami crisis, local Burmese authorities opted 
for openness and transparency in reporting casualties in the 
country. 
 
--- French Bilateral Cooperation Elsewhere --- 
 
¶3.  Ambassador Garbe indicated that France's bilateral avian 
influenza cooperation is limited to three countries in 
Southeast Asia: Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and is conducted 
via the Pasteur Institute.  In Africa, experts from the 
French Agricultural Research Center for International 
Development, specializing in tropical and sub-tropical 
regions, are working in coordination with OIE, FAO and WHO on 
avian influenza-related issues.  Garbe mentioned the view, 
that for him, the real avian influenza concern is in Africa 
given the "inability of African nations to address the 
situation."
