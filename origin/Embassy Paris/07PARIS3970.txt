REF:  PARIS 2439 
 
¶1.  Summary: On September 20, a "Le Monde" article, titled "France 
Turns Towards the End of GMOs," reported that the French government 
is considering freezing the sale of biotech seeds in 2008 pending 
legislation to more rigorously control biotechnology in France. 
This disclosure reportedly took agriculture analysts by surprise. 
Farmers expect a serious public debate on the future of 
biotechnology in France during ongoing environmental consultations, 
one part of the "Grenelle for the Environment."  While sources in 
the parliament confirmed the possible freeze, other government 
sources claim no decisions regarding biotechnology have been taken. 
End Summary 
 
¶2. The GOF is currently holding consultations on environmental 
topics through the "Grenelle for the Environment" (reftel) process. 
As reported reftel, the results of that process are expected to 
inform government policy regarding biotech production and research. 
"Le Monde" reported that Jean-Louis Borloo, State Minister for the 
Environment, met parliamentarians from the presidential majority on 
September 17.  During this meeting, he is reported to have stated: 
"On GMOs, everybody agrees that dissemination can not be controlled, 
so, we can not take any risk."  The article further stated that the 
GOF envisions a ban on sales of commercial biotech seeds (only 
MON810 seeds are approved for sale in France).  Senator Jean 
Francois Le Grand, chairperson of the biotechnology consultation at 
the "Grenelle de l'Environnement" said that this would not be a 
moratorium per se, but a temporary ban until the government passes a 
law regulating biotechnology.  He confirmed that the government has 
no intention to ban field testing nor in-lab research. 
 
¶3.  The article further reported that, at the initiative of public 
prosecutors, and possibly pursuant to orders from the Ministry of 
Justice, the prosecution of several anti-biotech activists, accused 
of destroying biotech test plots, had been indefinitely postponed. 
Almost 20 biotech corn fields, for research and commercial 
production, have already been destroyed in 2007 by anti-biotech 
activists. 
 
¶4.  The Le Monde report came the same day that the French arable 
crop association disclosed at its annual conference, for the first 
time, public support for biotechnology for research and commercial 
production.  Philippe Pinta, President of the association, looked 
stunned when he took the stage to disclose the potential biotech 
freeze.  French Agriculture Minister Barnier, booed by the audience 
as he approached the podium at the farmers convention, limited his 
speech to less than five minutes.  He denied in a short declaration 
that the government had made decision on the future of 
biotechnology.  On September 21, Christophe Malvezin, agricultural 
advisor to President Sarkozy, confirmed to Ag Officer that the 
government would continue the consultations before taking any 
position.  Sarkozy's spokesperson, Laurent Wauquiez, also issued an 
official confirmation of this position. 
 
¶5.  Pinta subsequently announced an emergency meeting of farm 
leaders.  Several farm organizations planned to withdraw from the 
Grenelle discussions in reaction to the possibility that the 
government was taking decision before the end of the consultations. 
In Brussels, an EU Commission spokesperson confirmed that a French 
ban on EU-approved commercial GM seeds would be illegal and could 
generate hefty fines for France. 
 
¶6. Anti-biotech organizations have called for the destruction of the 
2007 French GM corn crop (some 60,000 acres).  An anti-biotech 
demonstration is scheduled for September 22 in a small town in 
central France and a large march October 9 in Paris, culminating 
with a meeting on October 14.  There are rumors that additional 
demonstrations may occur subsequently to pressure the GOF to enact a 
moratorium on biotechnology production.
