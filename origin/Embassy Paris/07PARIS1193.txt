REF: STATE 33001 
 
¶1. (U) Econ Counselor raised reftel points on the Global Forum 
on Fighting Corruption with DAS-equivalent Cyrille Pierre and 
desk officer Francois Legue on March 23 and 26.  Legue said the 
French delegation to Johannesburg would be led by 
Ambassador-at-Large for the Fight Against Organized Crime, 
Jean-Pierre Vidon. (Legue will join the delegation.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) France shares U.S. views on the need to focus attention 
on promoting the UN Convention Against Corruption, and on 
international cooperation on asset recovery efforts.  It would 
encourage a final declaration that reflected these concerns. 
Legue expressed a degree of surprise over U.S. intentions to 
consider ending the Global Forum process, but he did not say 
that France would oppose such a move.  He promised to brief 
Ambassador Vidon on the U.S. position in advance of GF V.
