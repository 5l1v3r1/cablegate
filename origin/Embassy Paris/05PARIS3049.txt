¶1.  (SBU) Per ref request, Econ Chief discussed reftel 
non-paper and talking points with Foreign Ministry G-8 
Officer, Cyril Pierre.  Pierre, after digesting the U.S. 
information, noted that it was interesting and thanked Econ 
Chief for sharing the "status of U.S. compacts."  Pierre 
noted that while France supports the anti-corruption and 
transparency compacts and agrees with the plan as negotiated 
at Sea Island, it continues to have certain reservations 
about the Sea Island program.  He reminded Econ Chief that 
each G-8 country was to follow up with the pilot countries 
bilaterally and "voluntarily" and that each pilot country was 
to be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) After his disclaimer, Pierre again said he 
appreciated the U.S. initiative in sharing the information on 
USG activities.  The GOF had not had its interagency meeting 
to discuss how they would proceed and what they would/should 
say at the next FASS meeting.  Pierre noted that France had 
few bilateral interests or programs in Nicaragua or Peru and 
only slightly more in Georgia.  Nevertheless, he noted that 
they were interested in Nigeria, and particularly in the 
anti-corruption initiatives undertaken in recent months by 
Nigerian Minister of Finance Ngozi.  Therefore, he continued, 
while GOF programs under the anti-corruption/transparency 
compacts were unlikely with Georgia, Nicaragua and Peru, the 
GOF is more likely to undertake an initiative with the 
Nigerians.  Pierre was unwilling to speculate on what kind of 
program(s) the GOF might propose to Nigeria in advance of 
their interagency preparatory meeting.
