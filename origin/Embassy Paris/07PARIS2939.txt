SUBJECT: OECD -- GUIDANCE REQUEST -- ESTABLISHING OECD SUPPORT UNIT 
FOR G-8 HEILIGENDAMM DIALOGUE PROCESS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  On July 12 Council will be asked to take a 
decision on establishing a Support Unit for the Heiligendamm 
Dialogue Process (HDP) agreed at the G-8 Summit.  Although the 
Germans, as G-8 President, are pushing for a quick decision in order 
to initiate the process in the fall, they have been unable to 
provide many details of their proposal up to this point.  The 
Council discussion document, C(2007)88 (draft sent to EUR/ERA and 
EEB/PAPD on July 5), provides only the most general overview of the 
initiative and was circulated just at the limit of the minimum 
required seven days prior to Council discussion.  Several OECD 
members have raised questions regarding the role of the OECD (and 
all its members) and the relationship between the Heiligendamm 
Dialogue Process and the OECD's program of Enhanced Engagement.  A 
number of its proposed elements, from staffing and funding to 
OECD/IEA dynamics, are potential areas of concern for the USG.  U.S. 
Mission requests guidance for the preliminary July 1O Executive 
Committee and July 12 Council discussion.  End Summary 
 
¶2.  (SBU) At last month's (June 12) Council meeting, SG Gurria and 
German Ambassador Hoffman reported on the results of the G-8 Summit 
at Heiligendamm, notably the Summit Declaration's call for the 
establishment of a Support Unit to facilitate dialogue between the 
G-8 and the O-5 emerging economy, outreach countries (Brazil, China, 
India, Mexico and South Africa).  The SG noted that the G-8 request 
that the OECD host the Support Unit was an opportunity for the 
Organization to have an impact in terms of policy making on global 
issues.  Ambassador Hoffman announced that the German government 
would fully fund -- and head -- the unit.  He said that German 
Sherpa and chair of the ECSS, Bernd Pfaffenbach, would inform his 
ECSS counterparts about details of the Support Unit.  In the 
interim, Pfaffenbach has sent a letter to G-8 members and O-5 
countries asking them to engage with the OECD Secretary General in 
support of the initiative and that the Council be prepared to 
approve setting up the unit at its next meeting on July 12, so that 
the unit could begin operation in September.  A brief discussion 
ensued, with a number of ambassadors questioning the initiative and 
generally indicating their reservations. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On July 5, Heads of Delegation took up the HP briefly and 
considered an advance draft of the document C(2007)88 to be 
discussed at the decisive July 12 Council.  All the G-7 (with the 
exception of a silent Canada) spoke in support.  Questions that OECD 
ambassadors had raised in the June 12 Council had evidently received 
satisfactory responses from the Germans, but some outstanding issues 
remain.  These notably involve the relationship of the initiative to 
the OECD's Enhanced Engagement initiative launched at the May 
Ministeral, the composition of the steering group (non-G-8 countries 
urging opening up membership beyond the thirteen), the curious 
geometry of housing the HDP at the OECD, where one G-8 member has 
not acceded, one of the O-5 (Mexico) is an OECD member, and the lack 
of mention of Indonesia, the "missing" country specified in May for 
enhanced engagement. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The SG and Germans (the German Ambassador and a 
representative from Berlin responsible for Heiligendamm who briefed 
OECD Heads of Delegation) responded, indicating the HDP's structure 
would likely parallel that of the Africa Partnership Forum (APF) 
Support Unit (a similar undertaking established in the wake of 
Gleneagles).  The Germans noted that the initiative had a two-year 
notional time horizon and that Germany and the next two G-8 
presidents, Japan and Italy, would thus provide the funding for the 
Support Unit.  The SG added (as the Germans had earlier asserted) 
that staffing, at least at the unit's senior levels, would be 
restricted to these three countries' nationals.  With these 
clarifications, there appeared to be no further opposition to the 
establishment of the support unit.  We thus expect the July 10 
Executive Committee and July 12 Council meetings will result in the 
Unit's establishment. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The Mission is concerned that the Heiligendamm Dialogue 
Process Support Unit's work program, staffing and funding are 
not/not well defined enough that we could recommend supporting it. 
There are already divisions within the OECD over the role that the 
International Energy Agency (IEA) will play (e.g., the extent to 
which the HDP work is continuous with that of Gleneagles? and how 
 
much of the HDP's funding pledge can the IEA lay claim to?) and the 
restrictions on the staffing, which are a new departure for this 
kind of OECD undertaking. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Guidance Request:  That said, given the fact that all G-8 
leaders signed on to the concept of the HDP, we are reluctant to 
take the lead in questioning the initiative at this stage.  Due to 
the fast track nature of the German push for a quick decision, any 
apparent U.S. opposition could be seen as back-tracking on the 
Summit Declaration and could be perceived as a U.S.-German 
disagreement.  The USG is also pushing for a July 12 Council 
decision on establishing an OECD home for the advisory unit of the 
Partnership for Democratic Governance.  USOECD requests guidance on 
how to proceed at the July 10 Executive Committee discussion and 
July 12 Council discussion/decision.
