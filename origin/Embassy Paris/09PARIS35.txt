SUBJECT: BIGOT IS THE NEW CHAIRMAN OF FRENCH ATOMIC ENERGY 
COMMISSION 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: On January 7, 2009, Bernard Bigot was appointed 
Chairman of the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), succeeding 
Alain Bugat.  Since 2003 Bigot has been the High Commissioner for 
Atomic Energy at the CEA, where he was responsible for the quality 
of scientific research.  As chairman, he will manage the CEA fourth 
generation reactor development program and represent France on the 
ITER international thermonuclear fusion reactor project.  Under 
Bigot, relations between the CEA and the USG will remain strong. 
Bigot's strong scientific background will help manage CEA's broad 
research and development activities, its 15,000 employees and its 
Euros 3.4 billion budget.  End of summary. 
 
Goodbye Bugat, Hello Bigot 
-------------------------- 
¶2. (U) On January 7, 2009, the Government of France appointed 
Bernard Bigot, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission 
(administrateur general de Commissariat a l'energie atomique) 
succeeding Alain Bugat.  In his new role, Bigot will provide overall 
direction of the CEA, within broad guidelines set by the government. 
 
 
Likely Changes Ahead 
-------------------- 
¶3.  (U) While Bigot has yet to discuss publicly his priorities, he 
will likely reorganize CEA's life science sector.  One proposal is 
to transfer the CEA Life Science Department's nuclear medicine 
section to the French National Institute for Health and Medical 
Research (INSERM), currently headed by Andre Syrota, a former CEA 
Life Science Department Director.  Other CEA key issues included the 
international development of fourth generation reactors (the EPR 
successor), the ITER thermonuclear fusion project in Cadarache, and 
the handling of long-lived radioactive waste. 
 
Good contact of U.S. 
-------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) Bernard Bigot is an excellent contact of the U.S. Embassy 
and is very approachable.  At a reception in early January, he 
described himself as a collegial friend of the newly-nominated 
Secretary of Energy, Stephen Chu.  Additionally, he recently 
attended an Embassy reception in honor of current DOE Secretary 
Samuel Bodman. Relations between the CEA and USG have been excellent 
under his predecessor, and will continue strong under Bigot. 
 
Background of Bernard Bigot 
---------------------------- 
¶5.  (U) Bigot, 58, was born in January 1950 and is a graduate of the 
"Ecole Normale Suprieure de Saint-Cloud" (ENS, an elite French 
school)  in 1973.  He received a PhD in Chemistry from the 
University of Paris XI, and a PhD in Physical Sciences from Pierre 
and Marie Curie University.  Bigot was an associate professor in 
Physical Sciences and a former auditor at The Institute of High 
Studies in National Defense (Institute des Hautes Etudes de la 
Dfense Nationale).  For four years, he was director of the Catalyst 
Research Institute (Institut de Recherches sur la Catalyse) at the 
French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  He has 
written over 70 scientific journals on quantum physical chemistry 
applied to photochemistry, heterogeneous catalytic reactions, and 
nuclear energy.  From 1993 to 2003 Bigot worked at the Ministry of 
Research where he was successively Head of the Scientific and 
Technical Mission, Deputy Director of Research, and Chief of Staff. 
Bigot is an officer of the French Legion of Honor and the National 
Order of Merit. 
 
 
 
CEA: A Technology Driver

¶6. (U) CEA is a major player in research, development and innovation 
and is involved in the fields of energy, information technology, 
health, defense and security.  With over 15,000 researchers and 
collaborators, and nine established research centers in France, CEA 
provides technical expertise to the GOF.  Additionally, CEA 
participates fully in European and international research 
activities. 
 
CEA in 2007: 
 --15,612 Employees 
-- 3.4 billion Euros Budget
