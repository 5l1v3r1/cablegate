¶1. (U) On July 2, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided 
assurances concerning the transfer of nuclear technology from 
Washington Group International to AREVA including possible AREVA 
projects in the United Kingdom. In turn, the Ministry asks for 
similar assurances from the U.S. Government for AREVA nuclear 
technology provided to American firms.  In accordance with 
instructions in reftels, the Embassy will provide those assurances 
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Unofficial Embassy translation of the diplomatic note from 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (with Embassy clarifying notes in 
parentheses) is as follows: 
 
BEGIN TEXT OF FRENCH DIPLOMATIC NOTE 
 
 
Diplomatic Note 1997 ASD/QA dated July 2, 2009 
 
The Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs presents its 
compliments to the Embassy of the United States of America and 
refers to the document "U.S. government request for assurances for 
nuclear technology transfer from Washington Group International Inc. 
to AREVA." 
 
The Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs has the honor to inform 
the Embassy of the United States of America that the French 
government provides assurances that information related to the 
technology owned by the URS Washington Division following the 
acquisition of WGI and which will be transferred to AREVA in the 
framework of their joint venture or in the framework of the bid for 
the management of the Sellafield, Calder Hall, Capenhurst and 
Windscale sites will only be used for peaceful and non-explosive 
purposes.  The French government provides assurances that the 
retransfer of this information to third party countries will not 
take place without prior consent of U.S. authorities. In accordance 
with the U.S. government document previously mentioned, the French 
government further wishes to specify that these commitments are 
strictly limited to this contract and to information concerning 
technology which is the property of URS Washington Division. 
 
Reciprocally, French authorities wish to receive similar assurances 
from the U.S. government concerning the peaceful use (Embassy note: 
of technology and information) and non-retransfer to third party 
countries without the express authorization of French authorities in 
case of technology transfer by AREVA to URS Washington Division in 
the framework of the cooperation envisaged by the partnership 
agreement between AREVA, AMEC, and URS Washington Division. 
 
To implement these assurances, the Ministry of Foreign and European 
Affairs requests that, in case URS Washington Division envisages 
transferring to AREVA information related to nuclear technology as 
defined by NSG (Embassy note: Nuclear Suppliers Group) directives, 
in the framework of this cooperation, or in case AREVA envisages 
transferring information related to nuclear technology as defined by 
NSG directives, the two companies will consult each other and will 
jointly agree that this is a transfer of technology solely owned by 
URS Washington division or AREVA.  Once it has been approved by the 
respective national authorities, the technology transfer between URS 
Washington Division and AREVA will fall under the provisions of this 
diplomatic note. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs avails itself of this 
opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the United States of America 
the assurances of its highest consideration.
