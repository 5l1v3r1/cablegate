¶1. (U) Embassy has determined from open sources that OCEA's patrol 
boat contract with Algeria was one of the major foreign military 
contracts France obtained in 2007.  The company's website indicates 
that OCEA has existed since 1987, has approximately 150 employees, 
and produces 10 to 15 aluminum vessels per year (value in 2005:  27 
million euros), 75% of which are for export. 
 
¶2. (U) On December 17, 2008, Embassy wrote Mr. Jean-Marc Wavrant, 
Finance Director of OCEA, producer of Fast Patrol Vessels for the 
Algerian Naval Coast Guard, Quai de la Cabaude, 85100 LES SABLES 
D'OLONNE (Tel:  +33-2-51-21-05-90; Fax:  +33-2-51-21-20-06; email: 
rJoassard@ocea.fr) to ask for a response to reftel questions 
concerning the export of night vision device component parts to 
Algeria and company security procedures.  During a subsequent 
telephone conversation Mr. Wavrant stated that he had already 
provided similar information to the Department of State.  Embassy 
informed him that no previously communicated information was on file 
at Embassy Paris.  On January 26, 2009 Embassy again wrote Mr. 
Wavrant to ask for an immediate response to the Embassy's December 
inquiry, noting that failure to provide information could negatively 
impact export license requests.  Post received cursory response 
(para 3) from Mr. Wavrant on February 16. 
 
¶3. (U) Response by OCEA is as follows:

Dear Sir: 
 
In response to your request of January 26, 2009, we feel it is best 
to inform you that we have already responded to a State Department 
request regarding the case relevant to our contract with the 
Algerian Minister of Defense, a copy of which you will find herewith 
enclosed. 
 
We hope that you receive the attached in good order. 
 
      Sincerely,
