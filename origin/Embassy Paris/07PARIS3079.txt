SUBJECT: FRANCE INCREASES BORDER CONTROLS ON CHINESE FEED AND FOOD 
SHIPMENTS, MELANINE CONTAMINATION FOUND. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Following the lead of the U.S. to tighten border controls 
following the discovery of melanine tainted feed from China, the 
European Commission has asked Member States to reinforce safety 
controls on Chinese imports.  The French Ministry of Agriculture 
(animal and animal product imports) and Ministry of Finance - 
Consumer Protection (for other food imports) reacted by increasing 
documentary and chemical audits of Chinese feed and food shipments 
entering French points of entry. 
 
¶2. (SBU) FAS Paris learned from Ministry of Agriculture contacts 
that a Chinese soy-based ingredient shipment destined for France was 
found to contain melanine when tested by Belgian officials in 
Antwerp.  The MinAg is waiting for confirmation of these preliminary 
results.  French officials remained concerned that all Member States 
stay vigilant to prevent the importation of unsafe ingredient 
products from China that might be processed into French feed 
products. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Ministry of Finances' Fraud and Consumer Protection 
Office (DGCCRF) and Customs Bureau also increased their inspections 
of Chinese imports, both at the border and at processing plants, to 
heighten the security of food products for human consumption. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On June 29th, following the U.S. decision to ban some 
imports of Chinese seafood until proven to meet U.S. requirements 
and safety standards, EU officials asked Member States to elevate 
their controls on these products as well. French health officials 
may encourage the EU Commission to initiate more stringent measures 
similar to those of the U.S. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In 2006, China exported $ 6.1 billion agricultural, fish and 
forestry products (up 17 percent from 2005) to the EU, of which more 
than $ 680 million was exported to France.
