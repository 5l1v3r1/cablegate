Poloff delivered reftel points to DAS-equivalent for Mexico, 
Central America, and the Caribbean Gilles Bienvenu and Haiti 
Desk Officer Pierre Filatoff on February 15.  Bienvenu stated 
that the GOF shared both the U.S. assessment of the situation 
and the goal of successful elections.  He noted that as a 
result of a more productive relationship between the IGOH and 
MINUSTAH, improved security, and the disbursement of aid 
funds, the Haitian population is starting to believe that 
things are improving.  This is the reason, Bienvenu 
reinforced, that the planned ministerial level meeting in 
Cayenne was important -- by choosing several projects where 
funds could be quickly deployed and results could be seen, 
confidence in the IGOH and international community would be 
maintained.  Bienvenu met with Leslie Manigat during a recent 
visit to France by the former Haitian President, who echoed 
the improved sentiment among Haitians and stated that the 
solution to Haiti's problems is the political process and 
goes through elections.  Finally, Bienvenu indicated that 
France will contribute to the elections through the EU, 
though such funds were most likely to go through the UN 
rather than the OAS.
