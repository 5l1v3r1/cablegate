(SBU) Clement Leclerc, IO Desk Officer for African Affairs, 
confirmed December 14 that France favored extending both 
timber and diamond sanctions for Liberia.  He recalled a 
December 5 conversation with poloff in which he conveyed that 
France, while inclined to the extension of timber sanctions, 
would be guided by the recommendations of the UN Panel of 
Experts.  Leclerc now underscored that not only had the Panel 
called for renewal, but the Liberian President-elect herself 
had endorsed both continuing and additional economic controls 
in a meeting with the Panel.  Leclerc stated that the French 
delegation had made known its position in New York.
