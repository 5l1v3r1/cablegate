REF: STATE 112828 
 
Charge delivered reftel points to the Slovak MFA's Director 
General for UN Affairs, Ambassador Maria Krasnohorska, on 
November 3.  Charge thanked Krasnohorska for Slovakia's helpful 
stance at the UNHRC in Geneva on the Goldstone Report. 
Krasnohorska reiterated that Slovakia prefers the action on the 
Goldstone report be deferred until March 2010 in Geneva, and 
never supported a discussion at the UNGA in New York. 
Krasnohorska added that the Slovak MFA has seen the text of the 
Arab group's proposed resolution, finds it `absolutely 
unacceptable,' and has instructed the Slovak Mission in New York 
to vote against it.  Krasnohorska lamented the lack of an EU 
consensus position.
