SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION ON DEATH OF SLOVAK SOLDIERS IN 
IRAQ 
 
 
¶1.  THE DEATH OF THREE SOLDIERS IN IRAQ ON JUNE 8 HAS 
PROMPTED CONSIDERABLE MEDIA REACTION IN SLOVAKIA, MOST 
OF WHICH SUPPORTS THE CONTINUING PRESENCE OF THE SLOVAK 
TEAM IN IRAQ. 
 
¶2.  SME:  ON JUNE 9 AND 10, THE SME ONLINE VERSION CHAT 
    (CENTER RIGHT INDEPENDENT PAPER RELIED UPON BY 
INTELLECTUALS AND YOUNG PEOPLE) IS FAVORABLE TO 
SOLDIERS REMAINING ON DUTY, POINTING OUT THAT SLOVAK 
SOLDIERS GO TO IRAQ VOLUNTARILY, ARE PAID WELL FOR THIS 
DUTY AND SHOULD MAKE A REASONED ASSESSMENT ABOUT THE 
DANGERS INVOLVED.  THE CHAT IS NOT ANTI-AMERICAN. 
NEGATIVE READERS BLAME THE SLOVAK GOVERNMENT AND NOT 
THE U.S. CONCERNING SLOVAKIA'S INVOLVEMENT IN IRAQ. 
JUNE 9 COVERAGE IN SME INCLUDED A COLUMN BY PETER 
SCHUTZ DESCRIBING THE DEATHS AS AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT 
THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED DURING MILITARY DUTY IN 
SLOVAKIA. SCHUTZ CRITICIZES SLOVAK GOVERNMENT 
REPRESENTATIVES FROM SMER AND SNS FOR THEIR NEGATIVE 
STANCE. IN HIS OPINION, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BRING 
THE SOLDIERS BACK FROM IRAQ. 
 
¶2.  NOVY CAS:  NOVY CAS, THE WIDEST CIRCULATION PAPER 
IN SLOVAKIA AND A TABLOID, OFFERS AN ON-LINE 
QUESTIONNAIRE ABOUT WHETHER TO WITHDRAW SLOVAK SOLDIERS 
FROM IRAQ. THE MAJORITY OF RESPONSES FAVOR SOLDIERS 
REMAINING IN IRAQ.  AN ARTICLE ON JUNE 9 CALLED "I WILL 
SHOOT DZURINDA" EXPLAINS THAT AN EMPLOYEE UNDER THE 
AUSPICES OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION THREATENED TO 
SHOOT THE PRIME MINISTER.  A COLUMN BY VLADIMIR DONNER 
ON JUNE 9 CRITICIZES THE SLOVAK GOVERNMENT AND CALLS 
FOR TROOP WITHDRAWAL. 
 
¶3.  CENTER LEFT DAILY PRAVDA OFFERS COPIOUS CHAT 
REACTIONS IN THE ONLINE VERSION. SOME ASSESS THE 
SOLDIERS NOT AS HEROES BUT AS PEOPLE WHO WENT TO IRAQ 
FOR MONEY. MANY EXPRESS CONDOLENCES. FEW BLAME AMERICA 
    FOR THE DEATHS. SEVERAL CRITICIZE THE SLOVAK 
GOVERNMENT, MOSTLY PRIME MINISTER DZURINDA FOR SENDING 
THE SLOVAK ARMY TO IRAQ.  A JUNE 9 PRAVDA COLUMN BY 
LUBOS PALATA DESCRIBES SLOVAK SOLDIERS AS HEROES WHO 
DIED FOR A GOOD CAUSE. 
 
¶4.  NARODNA OBRODA: INDEPENDENT DAILY NARODNA OBRODA 
WITH TIES TO ANO OFFERED COMMENTARY JUNE 9 DESCRIBING 
THE DEATHS AS ACCIDENTAL AND BLAMING NEITHER THE SLOVAK 
NOR THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
¶5.  TV MARKIZA: ON PRIME TIME NEWS JUNE 9, MOST WIDELY 
WATCHED SLOVAK STATION TV MARKIZA REPORTED ABOUT THE 
DEATH OF THREE SLOVAK SOLDIERS IN IRAQ, MENTIONING THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT THE DEATHS WERE DUE TO AN ATTACK. THE 
TV NOTED THAT BOTH COALITION AND OPPOSITION LEADERS 
SENT CONDOLENCE LETTERS TO THE FAMILIES OF THE 
DECEASED.  PRIME MINISTER DZURINDA POINTED OUT, 
"TODAY'S TRAGEDY SHOULDN'T DISPUTE OUR PRESENCE IN 
IRAQ."  MR. FICO STATED THAT ONLY PROFOUND RESPECT FOR 
THE KILLED SOLDIERS AND THEIR FAMILIES STOPS HIM FROM 
SAYING MORE. 
 
¶6.  SLOVAK NATIOANL TV: ON JUNE 9 NEWS, A POLISH 
GENERAL SAID THAT THE DEATHS MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO AN 
ATTACK.  POLISH AND U.S. OFFICIAL CONDOLENCE LETTERS 
WERE NOTED. PRESIDENT SCHUSTER COMMENTED THAT THIS 
ACCIDENT SHOULD NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON SLOVAKIA'S 
PRESENCE IN IRAQ."  PARLIAMENTARIANS HRUSOVSKY AND 
BUGAR ALSO COMMENTED THAT A LINK SHOULD NOT BE CREATED 
TO QUESTION SLOVAKIA'S PRESENCE IN IRAQ, AS SUCH AN 
    ACCIDENT COULD ALSO HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN SLOVAKIA.
