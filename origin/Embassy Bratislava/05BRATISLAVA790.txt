On September 28, a delegation of visiting Israeli MFA 
officials met with the GOS to inform them of Israel's intent 
to open an Embassy in Bratislava (Note:  Currently, the 
Israeli Embassy in Vienna handles diplomatic relations 
between Israel and Slovakia.  End Note).  The visiting 
delegation included administrative and technical personnel to 
identify possible sites for the new Chancery, which the 
Israelis hope to open within a matter of months.
