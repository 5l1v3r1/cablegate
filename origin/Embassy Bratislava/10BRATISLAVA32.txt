¶1.  (U) PolOff delivered reftel demarche to Radovan Javorcik, 
Director of the Fifth Territorial Department at the Slovak MFA, 
and Marek Brieska, Desk Officer for Afghanistan, on January 25. 
Javorcik will accompany Foreign Minister Lajcak to the London 
Conference.  Javorcik said that he had already been pressed by 
the British Embassy in Bratislava to contribute to the Peace and 
Reintegration Trust Fund; however, Slovakia will most likely not 
pledge a specific amount this week, as the Slovak Aid budget is 
quite limited -- its budget for 2010 will be approximately six 
million euros -- and is still being finalized.  However, the 
Slovaks hope to contribute to the fund in the future. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U) Javorcik said the Slovaks will focus specifically on 
support for the reconciliation process and good governance.  He 
also said that FM Lajcak will express support for President 
Karzai, the fight against corruption, the promotion of good 
governance and justice, and the continuing need for civilian 
assistance that is devised by the Afghans.  If asked, the 
Slovaks will praise the postponement of elections in 
Afghanistan, as they believe it is crucial that the results be 
seen as credible for Afghanistan's long-term democratic 
development. 
 
 
 
 ¶3.  (U) On Slovakia's civilian assistance, Javorcik said that 
the Slovak government has approved legislative changes that 
would make it possible for civilians to deploy on overseas 
missions; these changes are now pending with the Parliament. 
Once approved, two police trainers are available to deploy to 
Afghanistan.
