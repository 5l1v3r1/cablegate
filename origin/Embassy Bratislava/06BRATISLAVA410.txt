SUBJECT: SLOVAKIA RELEASES STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR IRAQI 
GOVERNMENT FORMATION 
 
Â¶1.  (U)  The Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the 
following statement on Iraq,s formation of a national 
government on May 23.  The original text is available in 
Slovak at www.mzv.sk: 
 
BEGIN UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION: 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and the Government of 
the Slovak Republic happily welcomed the news of the 
successful completion of the process of forming a united 
national government of the Iraqi Republic, and congratulates 
the Iraqi legislative body on the achievement of this 
important success. 
 
The Slovak Republic believes that the creation of a new 
government built on a consensus of the Iraqi political 
spectrum will be a strong inspiration for a change in the 
behavior of previous opponents of renewing security and of 
the reconstruction of the country.  After many years of 
instability and fear of large-scale political crisis, as well 
as civil and religious unrest, the Iraqi citizens have 
finally earned a fair chance for a better future. 
 
The Slovak Republic will continue doing its share to maintain 
a secure situation and post-war renewal of the country until 
the time that the democratically elected government of the 
country deems necessary. 
 
END UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION.
