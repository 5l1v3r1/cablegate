Â¶1.  (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel points on May 10 to MFA 
Directors for International Organizations, UN Security 
Council, and Middle East affairs.  Colleagues from the 
British Embassy also followed-up on May 11.  On May 12, 
Ambassador Vladimir Lomen from the UNSC Coordination Unit 
called to say that Slovakia had reviewed our points and 
received the draft resolution in New York, and that Slovakia 
was supportive of such a resolution.  Lomen said that he was 
reviewing the document with the Middle East division to 
ensure the language was acceptable, but that he anticipated 
Slovakia would have no objection if the resolution was 
brought for a vote the week of May 15.
