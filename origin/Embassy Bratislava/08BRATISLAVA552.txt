PolOff delivered reftel demarche to Tomas Hrbac, Acting 
Director of the Slovak MFA's UN Department.  Hrbac agreed 
that the number of anti-Israel resolutions discussed at UNGA 
was excessive, and said that EU member states often try to 
negotiate the most egregiously one-sided resolutions with 
Arabic states to reflect a more balanced text.  Hrbac said 
that Slovakia will follow the common EU position, which he 
believes will be an abstention again on the three key 
resolutions highlighted in reftel (resolutions 60/80, 62/81, 
and 62/106), though Hrbac has heard that at least one EU 
member is inclined to support them.
