Â¶1.      (U) Leading Slovak cable news broadcaster "TA-3" broadcast 
an exclusive interview with Charge Eddins on Saturday, January 
23, as part of their half-hour evening special on the situation 
in Haiti.  In response to a query on speculation that the U.S. 
would "occupy" Haiti Charge Eddins strongly rebutted that "only 
the U.S. military could pull off a mission of such scope.  There 
were over 150 flights into the Port Au Prince airport yesterday 
alone."  TA-3 captures approximately fifteen percent of market 
share with its Saturday evening broadcast.  Overall coverage in 
Slovakia on the crisis in Haiti has been positive of U.S. 
efforts.
