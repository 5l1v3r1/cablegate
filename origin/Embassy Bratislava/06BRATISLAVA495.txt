SUBJECT: SLOVAKIA WILL NOT ACT ON VENEZUELAN NGO LAW 
 
REF: STATE 97547 
 
(SBU) We delivered reftel points on Venezuela's proposed 
legislative restrictions on NGOs to Miriam Cengelova of the 
MFAs Fifth Territorial Department (Americas) on June 15. 
Cengelova said that since Slovakia doesn't have an Embassy in 
Venezuela, they could not communicate any message to the 
government there. Poloff suggested Slovakia might send a 
message through a nearby Embassy, or encourage the EU as a 
whole to issue a statement. Cengelova said that she really 
doesn't think it is that important an issue for Slovakia, and 
did not seem willing to take any action based on our message.
