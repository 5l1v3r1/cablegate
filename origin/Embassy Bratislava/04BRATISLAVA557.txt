SUBJECT:  THREE SLOVAK SOLDIERS KILLED IN IRAQ 
 
 
¶1.   (U) ON JUNE 8, THREE SLOVAK SOLDIERS, TWO POLISH 
SOLDIERS, AND ONE LATVIAN SOLDIER WERE KILLED BY AN 
ACCIDENTAL EXPLOSION DURING A DEMINING OPERATION IN AL- 
    SUVARIYA, SOUTH OF BAGHDAD.  EARLY PRESS REPORTS 
INDICATE THAT THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED AT AN OLD MUNITIONS 
DEPOT.  THE SLOVAKS HAVE 105 DEMINERS DEPLOYED IN IRAQ, 
OPERATING IN THE POLISH SECTOR. 
 
¶2.  (U) DEFENSE MINISTER LISKA STATED DURING A PRESS 
CONFERENCE THAT THE DEATHS WERE ACCIDENTAL, IMPLYING 
THAT HE WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THE WITHDRAWAL OF SLOVAK 
TROOPS.  HE ADDED THAT A MILITARY COMMISSION HAS 
ALREADY DEPARTED SLOVAKIA TO INVESTIGATE THE ACCIDENT. 
 
¶3.  (U) WE ARE COORDINATING CLOSELY WITH THE PRIME 
MINISTER'S OFFICE AND THE MOD.  AMBASSADOR WEISER HAS 
SENT A CONDOLENCE LETTER TO BOTH PRESIDENT SCHUSTER AND 
PRIME MINISTER DZURINDA, WHICH IS BEING RELEASED TO THE 
PRESS. 
 
¶4.  (U) COMMENT:  THESE ARE THE FIRST SLOVAK CASUALTIES 
SINCE TROOPS DEPLOYED IN SUPPORT OF OPERATION IRAQI 
FREEDOM IN APRIL 2003.  THE DEPLOYMENTS HAVE BEEN 
CONTENTIOUS FROM THE BEGINNING AS THE SLOVAK GOVERNMENT 
WAS OUT IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC AND MANY POLITICIANS IN 
ITS SUPPORT OF OIF.  IN RECENT WEEKS, THERE HAVE BEEN 
CALLS FROM THE OPPOSITION AND FROM THE CHRISTIAN 
DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT (KDH) TO DISCUSS IN PARLIAMENT THE 
END OF THE SLOVAK MISSION IN IRAQ AS THE MANDATE IS 
CURRENTLY OPEN-ENDED.  THESE DEATHS WILL ALMOST 
CERTAINLY REOPEN DEBATE IN PARLIAMENT, WHICH RECONVENES 
ON JUNE 22.  END COMMENT. 
 
WEISER
