(SBU)   Spanish Subdirector General for Human Rights Fernando 
Fernandez-Arias told Poloff February 27 that Slovenia is the 
only Eastern European nation to have requested Spanish 
support for election to the UNHRC thus far.  He said that 
Spain supported Slovenia for the Council in 2006 and that 
Slovenia's candidacy is important as a representative of 
Southern Europe.  Fernandez-Arias said that Bosnia had not 
yet approached Spain but that Spain has an important and 
close relationship with Bosnia and would be amenable to its 
candidacy.  In any case, he said, Spain would not consider 
supporting Belarus under any circumstances.  Fernandez-Arias 
said that there was clearly a need for more quality 
candidates for such an important institution, and he 
emphasized the level of caution with which Spain is 
approaching these elections.  On the theme of EU 
coordination, he told Poloff that he will depart for Brussels 
February 28 for a meeting to discuss the EU approach to the 
UNHRC candidacies.
