¶1. (U) On June 25, the Spanish National Police (SNP) arrested 
four individuals based in Barcelona and Valencia.  The police 
suspect the four arrestees of trafficking in fake shirts, 
pants, belts, watches and eyewear, principally made in China, 
although some of the merchandise also came from India.  The 
police confiscated goods with an approximate market value of 
euros 20 million.  The head of the suspected group is of 
Indian origin; other participants include individuals of 
Chinese and Spanish nationality. 
 
¶2. (U) Comment: These arrests demonstrate once again that the 
Spanish police force is very active against Intellectual 
Property Rights (IPR) piracy.  Trademark violations are 
fairly common in Spain, although U.S. trademark owners have 
not asked the Embassy for help in recent years.  American IPR 
concerns are mostly in the copyright area.
