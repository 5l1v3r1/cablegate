CASE NO. K-1914 (RAFAEL F. GARCIA) 
 
REF: A. STATE 99586 
     ¶B. MADRID 722 
 
¶1.  Pursuant to reftel A request for input on the bona fides 
of registered broker Rafael Garcia Tudela, General Manager of 
Europavia Espana, S.A., Post reiterates its favorable 
assessment of both Europavia and Mr. Garcia.  As reported 
(ref B) subsequent to a July 2009 site visit to calle Jorge 
Juan 30, including a thorough company presentation, Post 
considers Europavia and Mr. Garcia to be reliable brokers and 
recipients of United States Munitions List (USML) items. 
Subject broker is known well and favorably to the U.S. 
Commercial Service, which has facilitated contacts between 
Europavia and U.S. companies seeking Spanish partners. 
Europavia enjoys an excellent reputation and represents 
several U.S. firms in Spain.  The following information is 
keyed to the questions found at paragraph 4 (ref A) and 
reiterates information provided previously in ref B. 
 
¶2.  Post confirms that this entity is in the business of 
brokering defense articles and defense services at the 
location indicated under its legal name. 
 
¶3.  Yes, Europavia is a regular supplier, primarily for 
military aircraft maintenance, registered with the Spanish 
Ministry of Defense Directorate General for Armament and 
Material (DGAM) (ref B).  Post has no derogatory information 
on Europavia and no reason to suspect the company's 
involvement with proscribed entities. 
 
¶4.  Will the brokering firm be handling or storing USML items 
on behalf of its clients?  If so, does it have secure 
facilities and proper accounting and security procedures for 
handling sensitive USML items?  Europavia does not habitually 
store USML items or any other components ordered on behalf of 
its clients.  Its warehouse, while secure, can only 
accommodate a small volume of goods.  Most equipment is 
delivered to the warehouse space in the garage below its 
offices and subsequently leaves via courier services. 
 
¶5.  When was the company established and who are its 
principals?  How many employees?  As reported ref B, 
Europavia was established in 1965 and employs 15 people in 
its Madrid office.  Europavia is privately held, wholly owned 
by principal French shareholder Eurotradia International, a 
consulting and services industry (ref B), which is in turn 
held by major European entities.  Rafael Garcia Tudela is 
General Manager of the Madrid-based Europavia.  Miguel Angel 
Tapia Carrasco, considered by USCS to be "one of the best 
professionals in this sector" is the company's general 
counsel or "delegate counselor." 
 
¶6.  What is the nature of its business and what other types 
of items does it handle?  Please see reftel B, paras 6 and 7. 
 
¶7.  What types of organizations are among its typical clients 
and in what countries are they located?  Please see reftel B, 
paras 6, 7, and 9. 
 
¶8.  Does the company understand the restrictions on USML 
items, especially the prohibition against unauthorized 
re-transfers and re-exports?  YES.  Nonetheless, Rafael 
Garcia, the subject of this tasking and report, sought Post's 
assistance in July 2009 in clarifying when the company's 
transactions might be subject to end-use prohibitions. 
Please see reftel B, para 8 for Garcia's specific questions 
(to date unanswered by PM/DTCC) about significant military 
equipment vs. dual-use items.  Post would appreciate a direct 
PM/DTCC point of contact for Mr. Garcia in this regard, in 
the event the company has recommendations for the periodic 
review of the USML.
