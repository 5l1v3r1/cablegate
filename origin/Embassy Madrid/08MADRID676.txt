REF: A. SECSTATE 46556 
     ¶B. LAMELA-JOUBERT-LIN EMAIL OF 6/6/08 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) As requested reftel, Post conducted inquiries into 
the development and end-use relating to electronic components 
referenced in application 05-050100474.  Representatives from 
Indra confirmed to post on June 16 that the company is using 
reftel components to develop both civilian and military 
versions of the Lanza Long Range surveillance radar.  The 
military version of the Lanza radar would be sent to 
Portugal's Ministry of Defense for a NATO project (NATO 
project 5W106001), and the civilian version of the Lanza 
radar would go to the Uruguayan Air Force's National 
Directorate of Civil Aviation to be used for air traffic 
control purposes. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Each of the four reftel components shipped to Indra 
would be used in a separate Lanza radar unit: one for 
Portugal's Ministry of Defense, two for the Uruguayan Air 
Force's National Directorate of Civil Aviation, and the last 
unit would be kept by Indra to support and service the 
contracts with the above end-users.  Representatives from 
Indra confirmed that there would be no other entity involved 
in developing the Lanza radar. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Indra further indicated development of the radars 
would not be complete until 2009 and that the company would 
file a request for the proper shipping permits at that time. 
Addresses of the two non-Indra end-users are listed below.
