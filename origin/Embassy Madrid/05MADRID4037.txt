(SBU) EconOff delivered reftel demarche November 16 to Pablo 
Montesino-Espartero, Subdirector General of Multilateral 
Economic Relations and of Air, Sea, and Land Cooperation at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. EconOff followed-up on 
November 21 and was informed by Montesino-Espartero that USG 
representatives should speak directly with Esteban Pacha, the 
Transportation Counselor at the Embassy of Spain in London 
who is coordinating Spanish support for the IMO elections. 
Paula Sancho Torrego, also in the Subdirectorate General of 
Multilateral Economic Relations and of Air, Sea, and Land 
Cooperation, communicated that it was odd for us to ask for 
support only a few weeks in advance of the elections, when a 
similar request via diplomatic note for support of Spain's 
candidacy has gone unanswered for four months. EconOff 
requested more info on the unanswered diplomatic note but 
Montesino-Espartero again suggested that our representatives 
speak directly with Pacha in London.
