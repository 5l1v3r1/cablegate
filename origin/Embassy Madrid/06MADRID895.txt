REF: STATE 57035 
 
Poloff delivered an advance copy of the Secretary's letter on 
the Human Rights Council, as well as accompanying talking 
points, to Spanish MFA Human Rights Director Fernando 
Fernandez Arias on April 11.  Arias undertook to convey the 
letter immediately to the Foreign Minister.  (Embassy is also 
conveying a formal copy of the letter directly to the Foreign 
Minister.)  As a preliminary response, Arias said that, like 
the US, Spain did not intend to put forth its candidacy now 
for the Human Rights Council, but would launch a campaign for 
membership in the 2008 Council elections, noting the 
importance of Spanish membership on the Council During 
Spain's EU Presidency in the first half of 2010.  (As an EU 
member, Spain has already pledged against voting for states 
subject to UN Security Council sanctions for human rights 
abuses, and against those states with a record of systematic 
human rights violations.)
