Unemployment Continues to Rise 
 
1.(U) The number of registered unemployed rose by 50,000 in 
December, the fifth consecutive monthly increase.  For all of 
2009, the number of registered unemployed rose by nearly 
800,000, on top of a 2008 increase of almost one million. 
Nearly four million Spaniards are registered as unemployed 
(and not all unemployed Spaniards are registered).  In a 
separate report, Eurostat said Spain's unemployment rate rose 
to 19.4% in November, the EU's second highest rate. (El Pais, 
1/5; Expansion, 1/8) 
 
2009 Inflation Estimated at 0.9% 
 
2.(U) The National Statistics Institute estimated 2009 
consumer price inflation at 0.9%, the lowest full-year figure 
on record.  The low rate means that inflation adjustments in 
many wage contracts will not be triggered.  (El Pais, 1/5) 
 
Wind Power Grew in 2009, as Did Renewable Energy Bill 
 
3.(U) Wind power generation increased by 15% in 2009 and 
accounted for over 13% of total electricity generation. 
Spain,s main electricity sources are natural gas, nuclear, 
wind, coal (down 27% in 2009 after declining 35% in 2008), 
and hydro.  However, total premiums incurred during the year 
for renewable energy under the GOS, generous feed-in tariff 
system reached 5.4 billion euros, well over the 4 billion 
euros predicted at the start of the year.   The difference, 
mainly due to more solar projects coming on line than had 
been expected, will put further pressure on regulated 
electricity rates, which the GOS has agreed to gradually 
increase in order to eliminate the difference between what 
consumers pay and what the generating companies are owed.

Iberdrola Receives Hundreds of Millions in USG Funds 
 
4.(U) Iberdrola received $703 million in USG incentives 
during 2009 and hopes to receive another $430 million in 
2010, according to the company.  Most of the incentives went 
to the company,s separate renewables division, Iberdrola 
Renovables, for wind energy projects.  These incentives, 
contained in U.S. stimulus legislation, cover approximately 
30% of the cost of the projects and substitute for a 
longstanding production tax credit.  Iberdrola Renovables 
received more than half of all such USG incentives for wind 
projects in 2009.  It says it will reinvest in the U.S. all 
such incentives it receives.  The company has 3,459 MW of 
wind capacity in the U.S., making it the country,s second 
largest wind power generator.  Separately, Iberdrola,s U.S. 
subsidiary received $96 million for the design of intelligent 
networks, and the company has been awarded $30 million for an 
electricity storage project.  (Expansion, 1/7, La Razon, 1/7) 
 
Iberdrola Leads Large Marine Energy Research Project 
 
5.(U) Iberdrola's engineering arm will lead a consortium of 
19 Spanish companies and 25 research centers in what is 
reported to be the  world,s largest R&D project on marine 
energy.  The three-year &Ocean Leader8 project will study 
ways to lower the costs of generating energy from ocean 
sources, such as waves and currents.  The project has a 
30-million-euro budget and has already received a 
15-million-euro grant from the Center for Industrial 
Technology Development and the government,s stimulus fund. 
It has also been chosen for  funding from the Cenit-E program 
of the National Plan for Scientific Investigation,

Spanish Companies Among Top Transportation Infrastructure 
Investors 
 
6.(U) Spanish infrastructure companies held six of the top 
eleven slots in an annual, global ranking of transportation 
infrastructure investment published by U.S. newsletter Public 
Works Financing.  Ferrovial-Cintra ranked in first place, 
with investments totaling over $77 billion since 1985 and a 
presence in 49 countries, including toll road concessions in 
the U.S.  Other top Spanish companies are: ACS (third, $35 
billion), Abertis (sixth, $21 billion), OHL (eighth, $15.5 
billion), Global Via (ninth, $15 billion), and Sacyr 
(eleventh, $9 billion).  ACS also owns a 30% share in the 
German company Hochtief, which ranked fifth with $28 billion 
in investments.  (El Pais, 1/7) 
 
ACS Buys U.S. Construction Company for $131M 
 
7.(U) ACS announced on January 4 its purchase of the New York 
company John P. Picone for $131.7 million.  The company 
specializes in public works, especially tunnels and water 
infrastructure.  This is ACS, third U.S. purchase in a 
little more than a year, after paying $150 million for 
Schiavone in late 2008 and $114 million for Pulice in 
December 2009.  (El Pais, 1/5) 
 
Fewer Highway Deaths, Again 
 
8.(U)  1,897 Spaniards died in highway accidents in 2009, the 
sixth consecutive year that fatalities have declined.  The 
number of highway deaths has been cut in half since 2003 
despite a 24% increase in the number of vehicles.  Among the 
factors credited for the decline are the introduction in 2006 
of a points system that leads to the suspension of repeat 
offenders, licenses, stiffer penalties for dangerous 
driving, more active enforcement, and public awareness 
campaigns.  (El Pais, 1/2)
