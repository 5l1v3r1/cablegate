SUBJECT: SPAIN: DEMARCHE ON G-4 FRAMEWORK RESOUTION 
DELIVERED 
 
REF: SECSTATE 126870 
 
¶1. (U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to MFA Deputy 
Director General for the United Nations Juan Manuel Gonzalez 
de Linares. Gonzalez de Linares said Spain agreed 
enthusiastically with most of reftel talking points, with the 
exception of the following: 
 
  -- Spain would like to see a requirement of a 0.7% of GDP 
aid budget among developed countries serving on the Security 
Council. 
 
  -- Spain does not support the addition of any new permanent 
members of the Council, only non-permanent members. 
 
  -- Spain does not see much of a difference between a 
Council of 21 and a Council of 25, and thinks that the goals 
of efficiency and accountability can be achieved with 25 
members, allowing for a more representative Security Council 
whose membership takes ownership in the affairs it deals with. 
 
¶2. (U) Spain agrees that the G-4 framework resolution would 
be devisive, and that the decision on the number and type of 
new seats on the Security Council should not be made 
separately from that on which countries meet the criteria. 
The GOS agrees as well that the reform of the Security 
Council should not take precedence over nor stall reform in 
other areas.
