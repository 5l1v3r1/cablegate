SUBJECT: INVITATION FROM SPANISH MINISTRY OF DEFENSE TO 
PARTICIPATE IN SEMINAR ON SECURITY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, 
BARCELONA, DECEMBER 1-2, 2008 
 
¶1. (U) The Ambassador received November 13 the following 
letter (translated in relevant part) from Manuel Lopez 
Blazquez, Spanish MOD Director General of Institutional 
Relations. 
 
Begin text: 
 
The Ministry of Defense of Spain and the CIDOB Foundation of 
Barcelona (Center of Investigation of International Relations 
and Development), sponsor annually an international seminar 
concerning security and defense in the Mediterranean.  The 
meeting constitutes a forum for the exchange of ideas in 
relation to Mediterranean security.  Moreover, it is a point 
of encounter that encourages mutual understanding and 
relations between the coastal countries of the Mediterranean, 
those of the European Union, those of NATO, and those others 
interested in this question because of their geographic 
proximity. 
 
The seventh edition of the seminar will be celebrated in 
Barcelona December 1-2.  In this meeting, we intend to review 
the initiatives of cooperation underway and contemplate 
possible future perspectives in areas such as the ESPD in the 
Mediterranean, scenarios of security (or insecurity) in the 
Mediterranean, fundamental freedoms and security in the 
Mediterranean, civil-military cooperation in humanitarian 
missions, and the reform of the security sector.  A 
provisional agenda is attached. 
 
Minister (of Defense) Carme Chacon has directed a letter to 
her counterparts in the countries previously mentioned 
inviting them to designate a representative of their 
department to participate in the seminar.  In this regard, I 
ask that the Embassy make a direct effort to encourage the 
present of representatives of your country who have 
responsibilities or interests in the subjects that will be 
dealt with in this seminar. 
 
Additionally, it would be a great satisfaction to count on 
your presence in the seminar or, if you consider it 
convenient, that of Embassy personnel whom you consider 
opportune.

¶2. (U) Please advise if there is interest from Washington (or 
elsewhere) in sending a representative to this seminar.  We 
will send a copy of the draft agenda to EUR/WE. 
AGUIRRE
