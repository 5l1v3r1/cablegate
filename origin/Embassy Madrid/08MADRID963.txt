¶1. (U) On September 3, Econoff raised the issue of investment in 
Argentina with Alejandro Alvargonzalez San Martin, MFA Deputy 
Director General for Bilateral Economic Relations with Developing 
Countries.  Alvargonzalez noted that the stock of Spanish investment 
in Argentina amounts to approximately 35 billion euros, making Spain 
the country's largest foreign investor, and that Spanish companies 
are experiencing problems similar to those described in reftel.  In 
particular, firms involved in Argentina's electricity and oil and 
gas sectors, e.g., Endesa and Repsol, as well as some in highway 
administration, were adversely affected by the freezing of tariffs 
during the 2001 economic crisis and suffered considerable losses. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Some of these companies, Alvargonzalez stated, had brought 
cases before ICSID, but later withdrew them as the GOS, seeking to 
avoid tensions, pursued a policy of negotiating with the GOA on a 
case-by-case basis, an approach which has yielded positive results 
in some cases, but which he acknowledged is a very slow and often 
frustrating process.  Alvargonzalez had no views on the 
interpretation of Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention but 
found it unsurprising that the GOA was failing to comply with its 
obligations, as many Spanish investors are still encountering 
problems and are, in his view, likely to continue to do so.  He 
cited a recent Bank of Spain report that listed Argentina as a 
high-risk country for foreign investors, and President Fernandez de 
Kirchner's rejoinder that the Bank should focus on its own problems, 
as illustrative of the strained bilateral investment relations.  He 
also mentioned the Aerolineas Argentinas situation, in which the 
Spanish controlling shareholder, Marsans, was pressured to sell its 
stake back to the GOA.  Alvargonzalez added that some Spanish 
investors were able to reduce their risks, or improve their chances 
of favorable treatment from the government, by taking on local 
partners, as in the case of Repsol YPF.
