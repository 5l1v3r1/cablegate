Poloff delivered Reftel talking points and Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice's statement concerning Iran on March 17 to 
Enrique Mora Benavente, MFA Head of EU Policy Planning.  The 
GOS sees U.S. recent actions on Iraq as a "very positive 
development."  EU High Representative for the Common Foreign 
and Security Policy Javier Solana referred to the positive 
developments during discussions with EU foreign ministers in 
Brussels on March 16 at the GAERC meeting.  Mora Benavente 
said that EU pressure on Iran would now be more effective. 
The GOS looks forward to seeing good results in EU 
discussions with the Iranians.  Mora Benavente added that he 
saw the U.S. dropping its objection to Iran's application for 
WTO membership as very important to the current negotiations.
