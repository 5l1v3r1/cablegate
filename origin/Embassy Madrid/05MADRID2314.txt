SUBJECT: NOVEMBER 14-16 TERRORISM FINANCE CONFERENCE IN 
MADRID 
 
¶1. Summary: The Embassy, Ministry of Interior and the Ortega 
y Gasset Foundation (a well-respected thinktank) are 
collaborating on a November 14-16 terrorism finance 
conference in Madrid.  This will be the fourth conference on 
terrorism issues we put together with the GOS and the 
Foundation.  The previous conferences have been successes in 
terms of public diplomacy and in enhancing bilateral 
cooperation.  We expect this event to be similarly 
successful.  In order to amplify our public diplomacy 
message, we would like high level USG participation. 
Specifically, we request Assistant Secretary E. Anthony 
Wayne's participation in the November 16 fourth 
panel:"Cooperation in the Stuggle against Terrorism Finance". 
 Deputy TFCO is also working with the Public Discourse 
Project (an organization dedicated to carrying on the 9/11 
Commission's work) to get a 9/11 Commissioner and/or staff 
member to attend the conference.  We are also working to 
obtain William F. Baity's (Deputy Director, FinCEN) and 
Mathew Levitt's participation.  End Summary 
 
DRAFT AGENDA 
 
¶2.  There follows below the tentative agenda for the 
conference developed by the U.S. Embassy and the Ortega y 
Gasset Foundation.  This is highly tentative. With the 
exception of Bruce Hoffman, no American has been contacted 
yet about participating in this event.  To the extent 
necessary, Embassy can support U.S. travel to the conference.
