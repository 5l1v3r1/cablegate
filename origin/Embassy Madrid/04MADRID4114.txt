ACCESS REVISION 
 
REF: STATE 214729 
 
Mission has reviewed host government market access 
commitments e-mailed by Commerce desk officer to Commercial 
Service.  There is one possible potential area for expansion. 
 The GOS is committed to extensive desalinization projects in 
the south of Spain.  We are confirming that contracting for 
these projects will be managed by entities covered in the 
e-mailed lists.  Should we learn that contracting will not be 
performed by covered entities, we will inform Department.  As 
a general matter, the Mission assists U.S. firms with 
government procurement opportunities, especially in the 
defense area recently, although we have not received 
complaints regarding access to government procurement 
projects during the past year.
