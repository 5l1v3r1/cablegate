¶1. This message is sensitive but unclassified. 
 
¶2. Per ref B instructions, Embassy delivered the Special 301 
demarche to Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade 
Subdirector General for EU Trade Policy, Inigo Febrel 
Melgarejo, on 9/5/07; Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade 
Deputy Head of Services for the Information Society, Salvador 
Soriano Maldonado, on 9/10/07; and, Ministry of Culture 
Subdirector General for Intellectual Property, Pedro 
Colmenares, on 9/12/07. 
 
¶3. The Ministry of Industry's Salvador Soriano told EconOffs 
about the planned Madrid November 7/8 Intellectual Property 
conference - see ref A.  Clearly, this conference is going to 
be a centerpiece of GOS efforts to demonstrate its 
seriousness on IPR matters, particularly on internet-related 
copyright issues.  The Ministry of Culture's Pedro Colmenares 
was skeptical regarding the possibility of much action during 
an election year (parliamentary elections must be held by 
March 2008 at the latest).
