¶1. (U) Per reftel, Econoff conducted an investigation into 
the membership of the World Tourism Organization (WTO), based 
in Madrid, to confirm that no members of this organization 
condone or seek the legalization of pedophilia.  Based on 
this investigation, post believes that there is no reason to 
suspect that the WTO grants any official status, 
accreditation, or recognition to any organization which 
promotes or seeks the legalization of pedophilia or has 
subsidiaries or member organizations that do. 
 
¶2. (U) Econoff reviewed the list of roughly 300 "Affiliate 
members" comprised of business groups, destination councils 
and educational institutions.  Based on the review of this 
list, there is no reason to suspect that any of the 
organizations are related with approval or promotion of the 
legalization of pedophilia.  Post has a copy of this list and 
will send it on to IO/RHS per reftel.  Alternatively, the 
list can be accessed at 
http://www.unwto.org/afiliados/directory/en/d irectory.php. 
 
¶3. (U) The WTO has an extensive program under its "Task Force 
to Protect Children from Sexual Exploitation in Tourism" 
which was established in 1997.  The task force had its 
twenty-first meeting in London on November 12, 2007, and 
featured a special session on successful strategies and good 
practices against sexual exploitation of children in tourism. 
 
¶4. (U) Total staff time dedicated to this project was 
approximately 2-3 hours. 
 
¶5. (U) The embassy contact for this issue is Economic Officer 
Lourdes Lamela, LamelaLM@state.gov, 34 91 587-2399.
