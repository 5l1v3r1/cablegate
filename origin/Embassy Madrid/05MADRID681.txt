AUTHORITIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 28352 
 
¶1. Spain's designation of financiers of terrorism follows the 
EU Clearinghouse standard.  Spain brings entities for 
designation to the EU Clearinghouse and freezes assets of 
terrorists designated by the EU or the UN. 
 
¶2. The responsible entity for ensuring that sanctions are 
implemented against individuals and organizations listed by 
the UN is the Ministry of Economy's Directorate General of 
the Treasury, particularly the Subdirectorate General of 
Inspection and Control of Capital Movements. 
 
¶3. The authority that transmits Spanish positions on 
financiers of terrorism to the EU Clearinghouse is the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The decision to propose a 
listing follows an ad-hoc inter-ministerial coordination 
process that includes the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and 
Interior as well as the intelligence service.  Once Spain's 
Terrorist Finance Law of 2003 is implemented a statutory 
Commission for the Financing of Terrorism will be the 
authority authorized to designate a terrorist organization.
