Econoff delivered reftel points June 7 to Armando Riesgo, 
Subdirector General for Cooperation in Mexico, Central 
America and the Caribbean at the Spanish MFA.  On June 14, 
Econoff followed up on reftel points with Riesgo.  Riesgo 
said that the GOS is studying the matter and would work in 
cooperation with the OAS on the election issue, but could not 
provide a final answer on the amount of a Spanish financial 
donation, if any.  He then noted that Spain is contributing 
both troops and technical advisors in support of the 
elections, underlining the Spanish commitment to the 
democratic process.  Finally, Riesgo said that he could not 
provide a time frame for the Spanish decision on financial 
contributions.
