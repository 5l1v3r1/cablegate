¶1. Summary.  In a November 15 meeting with A/S for Consular 
Affairs Maura Harty, Spanish Secretary of State for Security 
Antonio Camacho agreed to deepen information exchanges with 
the USG by exchanging terrorist lookout information as 
contemplated in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 
(HSPD) 6.  A/S Harty and Camacho signed an aide memoire (see 
para 7) committing the two governments to develop operational 
procedures for the sharing of terrorist screening 
information.  USG and Spanish working groups will be 
designated to work out the technical and legal details and 
implement the mutually agreed information sharing procedures. 
 End Summary. 
 
¶2. A/S Harty met with Secretary of State for Security (Deputy 
Interior Minister equivalent) Camacho and members of his 
team, including Camacho's senior terrorism adviser Eugenio 
Pereiro.  A/S Harty was accompanied by the DCM, CA/P/IP Chief 
Alcy Frelick, Consul General Dan Keller, CA Special Assistant 
Julie Rutorbories, and poloff.  Harty recalled Camacho's July 
visit to Washington and their discussion of HSPD-6 and the 
USG desire for increased information sharing with key foreign 
partners.  She noted that Camacho had seemed well disposed 
towards Spain's participation in such an information exchange 
during that visit, a relationship the USG would welcome in 
light of Spain's great experience in combatting terrorism. 
Harty said the USG wanted to proceed with an information 
exchange with Spain and proposed that she and Camacho sign an 
aide memoire committing the two governments to develop the 
mechanisms to permit such an exchange.  Harty emphasized that 
such a mechanism would not be intended as a substitute for 
the existing informal information exchanges between Spanish 
authorities and USG agencies at the Embassy and in the U.S. 
She said that the USG would then seek to replicate this 
"Madrid model" with other foreign partners. 
 
¶3. Camacho said that there was ample evidence of good will 
and a desire for closer collaboration between the U.S. and 
Spain in counter terrorist efforts.  He quickly reviewed the 
draft aide memoire developed by the U.S. team and agreed to 
sign the document.  A/S Harty and Camacho each signed two 
English and Spanish language copies of the aide memoire and 
kept one set.  The next step will be the appointment of 
working groups on the Spanish side and on the U.S. side to 
develop the technical mechanisms for the sharing of terrorist 
lookout information and to ensure that the protocols 
established to carry out such an exchange comply with the 
legal/privacy requirements of each of the parties. 
 
¶4. Camacho noted that the USG-drafted note suggested Spain's 
National Antiterrorist Coordination Center (CNCA) as a 
possible Spanish counterpart to the U.S. Terrorist Screening 
Center; he said this could function well since his senior 
adviser Eugenio Pereiro would be named as the new Director of 
the CNCA in the coming days.  (NOTE: Pereiro's appointment 
was officially announced late on November 15. END NOTE). 
 
¶5. Following the meeting with Camacho, CA/P/IP Chief Frelick 
met with an interagency Spanish team from the CNCA to brief 
them on the meeting with Camacho, describe the work of the 
Terrorist Screening Center, and establish initial contacts 
with the organization most likely to coordinate Spain's 
participation in HSPD-6 information exchange.  The CNCA team 
noted that it was a new organization and was undergoing a 
leadership transition, but was receptive to the U.S. 
briefing.  Both sides agreed that the next step would be to 
name the members of the working groups that will develop the 
procedures for exchanging terrorist screening information. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
¶6. We are very pleased with the progress on HSPD-6 and 
greatly appreciate A/S Harty's role in obtaining Spain's 
agreement to move ahead.  This agreement serves as another 
indicator of our strong security relationship with Spain, at 
both the political level and the working level.  Eugenio 
Pereiro's designation as the director of the CNCA is 
fortunate in that he is an excellent interlocutor who we 
expect will work very well with the USG working group.  Until 
now, the CNCA has served primarily as an analytical 
organization rather than as an operational unit, so it may 
take some time to adjust to this additional mission.  We will 
continue to coordinate with CA as we organize the working 
groups and pursue implementation of this exchange.

//TEXT OF AIDE MEMOIRE// 
 
¶7. BEGIN TEXT: 
 
Representatives of the Government of the United States of 
America and the Kingdom of Spain (the Participants) have been 
engaged in ongoing efforts to prevent and address 
international terrorism, including cooperation in identifying 
known and suspected terrorists.  In the course of discussions 
between the Participants, an understanding has been reached 
that they should supplement those existing efforts by 
sharing, on a regular basis, real-time terrorism screening 
information. 
 
To accomplish this, the Participants are developing 
operational procedures for the sharing of terrorist screening 
information by the United States Terrorist Screening Center 
(TSC) and Centro Nacional de Coordinacion Antiterrorista 
(CNCA).  Among other things, the operational procedures 
should address the scope and method of exchange, arrangements 
for encounters, and measures to safeguard the information. 
These procedures are intended to complement existing channels 
of communications between the Participants and are not 
intended to supersede or otherwise affect existing and future 
exchanges of information and cooperation on international 
terrorism between agencies of the Participants.  The sharing 
of terrorist screening information between the Participants 
for screening purposes is expected to commence upon mutual 
acceptance of the operational procedures.
