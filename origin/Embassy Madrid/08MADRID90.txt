As per reftel request, Econoff spoke with Carmen Molina, 
Director of Human Resources at the World Tourism Organization 
(UNWTO), on January 29.  As in prior years, Molina expressed 
regret that she was unable to provide the personnel and 
budgetary information requested in reftel since the US is not 
a member of the UNWTO.  Molina informed Econoff that such 
information was only available to members.  She offered 
however to assist in future generic information requests.
