¶1.  Post conveyed reftel appeal December 11 to MFA 
SubDirector General for Continental Asia Jose Luis Garcia 
Galan, who agreed to discuss the matter with colleagues at 
the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and 
Development (AECID). 
 
¶2.  AECID contacts, in response to the urgent appeal for 
short-term assistance to cover World Food Program shortfalls 
in 2010 in Pakistan, assured Post December 14 that Spain was 
following the situation "with interest" and would consider 
new contributions beginning in January 2010.  According to 
the head of AECID's Emergency and Post-conflict Department in 
the Office of Humanitarian Action, Pablo Yuste Echarren, his 
office has dedicated 8.5 million Euros to the crisis, of 
which 4.5 million were designated for WFP activities.  He 
confessed that AECID's 2009 budget was "practically 
exhausted," but agreed to review additional commitments in 
the new year.
