ESTHOFF made reftel points December 21 to MFA International 
Legal Advisor Concepcion Escobar Hernandez, explaining the 
U.S.-Australia Continental Shelf Commission submission 
arrangement, noting our view that the arrangement protects 
the legal equities of both claimant and non-claimant states 
parties, and inviting Spain to consider following our lead in 
the event Madrid has similar concerns vis-a-vis the 
Australian submission.  Escobar said that Sergio Roman 
Carranza Forster of her staff would analyze our points and 
would contact the Embassy if the GOS needed any additional 
information regarding the details of the U.S.-Australia 
arrangement.
