¶1.  ECONOFF made reftel points August 25 to Spanish Agency 
for International Cooperation (AECI) officials Maria Eugenia 
Martin and Antonio Garcia Ferrer, urging Spain to provide 
significant amounts of humanitarian assistance to Lebanon. 
Eugenia Martin and Garcia Ferrer told ECONOFF that Spain's 
delegation to the August 31 Stockholm Conference would be led 
by Foreign Minister Moratinos and AECI Secretary General Juan 
Pablo Delaiglesia. They indicated that Spain has provided 
four million euros of assistance to Lebanon since the 
outbreak of war.  The monies were disbursed via the following 
organizations: 
 
--  WFP - 500,000 euros 
--  UNHCR - 800,000 euros 
--  UNICEF - 800,000 euros 
--  International Red Cross - 1,000,000 euros 
--  Lebanese NGO Arc en Ciel - 400,000 euros 
--  Lebanese NGO Development Action Without Borders - 100,000 
euros 
--  City of Saida - 400,000 euros 
 
¶2.  Eugenia Martin and Garcia Ferrer also said that Spain 
sent a plane load of medicines that went to the Lebanese 
Ministry of Health and the City of Saida.  (Note - the value 
of these medicines likely explains the difference between the 
four million euro figure mentioned by AECI contacts in Madrid 
and the 4,115,000 euro figure for Spanish assistance cited in 
European Commission documents.  End Note.) 
 
¶3.  ESTHOFF contacted Ferrer August 28, who confirmed that 
the above information remained accurate.  Ferrer indicated 
that Foreign Minister Moratinos would announce a 
"significant" new contribution to Lebanon at the August 31 
Stockholm conference.
