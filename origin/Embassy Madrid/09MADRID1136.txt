Â¶1. (SBU) POLOFF on November 25 delivered REF demarche to 
Carlos Torres, Counselor for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and 
Disarmament within the MFA's DG for Strategic Affairs and 
Terrorism, who stated that Spain intends to co-sponsor 
Russia's resolution on the establishment of a nuclear fuel 
reserve at Angarsk, Russia.  Torres said that the only thing 
that would prevent Spain from doing so would be if the EU 
decided to oppose it, but he did not foresee that happening.
