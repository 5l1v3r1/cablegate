¶1. (SBU)  POLOFF delivered REFTELS on May 23 to MFA 
Disarmament Affairs Deputy Director General Ignacio Sanchez. 
Sanchez reviewed the points and said that any GOS agreement 
to share Iran denial information would have to be coordinated 
with other Spanish Ministries.  Sanchez undertook to pass the 
points around and reply with a coordinated response.  In 
terms of GOS attendance at a NSG open-ended meeting in Vienna 
the week of June 4, Sanchez said that he would ask one of 
Spain's other Ministries to attend, as the MFA's limited 
nonproliferation staff will be tied up with events in Madrid, 
the Australia Group plenary in Paris and a working group in 
Brussels.  Post will report any additional information 
received from the Spanish MFA.
