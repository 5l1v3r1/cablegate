Embassy relayed reftel points on May 20 to MFA Deputy 
Director General for Middle East Affairs Alberto Moreno. 
Moreno offered no immediate reaction to the USG points.  He 
said that Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos will lead 
the Spanish delegation to the Conference.  Moreno will head 
the Spanish team in the meetings leading up to the 
ministerial-level sessions, though Moreno indicated that 
further senior-level MFA officials could be added to the 
Spanish delegation closer to the date of the Conference. 
Embassy contacted Luxembourg Embassy political officer Serge 
Hentzing and shared USG points and a readout of the 
discussion with Moreno.  Hentzing expressed appreciation for 
the information and said he would follow up as necessary.
