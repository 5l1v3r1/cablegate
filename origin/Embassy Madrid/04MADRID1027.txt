¶1.  We are working with the Spanish Council of Chambers of 
Commerce to organize the April 29 Madrid visit of Admiral 
David Nash and delegation.  The Council is open to inviting 
other European and Moroccan companies to participate.  The 
Council agrees with the format for the conference suggested 
reftel -- welcoming/plenary remarks followed by break-out 
sessions (the nature of which will be determined by prime 
contractor participation.)  The likely venue for the event 
will be a pavilion at the IFEMA fair grounds near Madrid's 
Barajas airport.
