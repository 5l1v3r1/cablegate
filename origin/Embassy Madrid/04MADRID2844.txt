SUBJECT: SPAIN SUPPORTS REVISED DRAFT UNSC RESOLUTION ON 
DARFUR 
 
REF: STATE 159921 
 
(U)  We delivered points on the revised UNSC draft resolution 
on Darfur (reftel) on July 23 to UN Affairs Deputy Director 
General Juan Manuel Linares at the Spanish Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  Linares told us that Spain would support 
the UNSC resolution on Darfur because it outlined an action 
timetable; improved the language on sanctions against 
Jingaweit leaders and their associates; and urged the 
Government of Sudan to uphold N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement 
and allow humanitarian access.  Linares also said that he 
expected that new draft would ease the concerns of China, 
Algeria, and Pakistan about placing sanctions on the 
Jingaweit.
