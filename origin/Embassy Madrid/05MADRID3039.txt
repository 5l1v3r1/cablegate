(U) Post's discussions with EADS CASA, based on the limited 
information available, indicate that EADS CASA did not order 
filtered lamp assemblies from Revue Thommen AG or Bitterlin 
AG.  EADS CASA confirmed that EADS CASA has made purchases 
from Revue Thommen, most recently in 2003, but has no record 
of current/open purchases.  EADS has made purchases from 
Bitterlin as recently as June 2005, but none of the purchase 
orders appear to match the one in question.
