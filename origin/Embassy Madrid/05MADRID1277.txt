¶5.  In general, Spain is safe. However, Madrid, 
Barcelona and other large cities in Spain - including 
resort/convention areas such as Benidorm - attract a 
large number of criminals and pickpockets and frequent 
incidents of crime of opportunity against the unwary do 
occur.  Carry only essential items including a photo- 
copy of your passport's photo page.  Visitors can 
protect themselves against crime by being street-smart, 
alert and aware of their surroundings.  In the event 
you are victimized by crime, or experience any security- 
related incident, please contact the Embassy's Regional 
Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after ours at 91-587- 
¶2355. Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or the 
Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to 
receive a security briefing from the RSO office at 
their earliest convenience.  Additional information 
regarding safety and security in Spain is available on 
the U.S. Department of State's website 
(http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy's website 
(www.embusa.es). 
 
¶6. Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent 
Worldwide Caution issued by the Department of State. 
As the Department of State continues to develop 
information on any potential security threats to 
Americans overseas, it shares credible threat 
information through its Consular Information Program 
documents, available on the Internet at 
http://travel/state.gov.  In addition to information on 
the Internet, U.S. travelers can hear recorded
