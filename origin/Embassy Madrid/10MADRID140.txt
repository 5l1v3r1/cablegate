SUBJECT: SPAIN PROVIDES EU RESPONSE TO CITES PROPOSALS 
 
REF: STATE 06668 
 
 ¶1.  Econoff delivered reftel demarche talking points to 
Manuel Calderon, Head of the Scientific Evaluation Section 
for CITES of Spain's Office of Biodiversity in the Ministry 
of Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs on January 25. 
On February 3, Calderon responded to the US proposals, 
explaining that he had needed to wait until after a 
coordination meeting for EU positions on CITES proposals.  He 
added that while his response represented the "current state 
of discussion" for the EU, some of the positions could still 
change by COP 15. 
 
¶2.  Calderon said that the EU supports the shark proposals 
and is likely  to continue to do so.  On the coral proposal, 
he noted that the EU is a co-sponsor of the proposal, which 
means it will support it (despite opposition from Italy). 
Calderon described the EU position on the polar bear proposal 
as "open and being determined at this time," with some 
disagreement amongst the EU member states based on 
differences of opinion regarding the ability of polar bear 
management practices in Canada and Greenland to positively 
adapt to changing conditions.  On the bobcat proposal, he 
said that the EU opposed the proposal because it feels that 
the identification issue has not been resolved.  Calderon 
concluded that the EU supports the snake proposal. 
 
¶3.  Calderon told econoff that he will be attending COP 15 
and that Alfredo Bonet, Secretary General for International 
Trade in the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade, would 
be Spain's head of the delegation.  Spain's delegation will 
include generalists responsible for multiple species. 
Calderon said he could serve as the delegation's 
point-of-contact and that his contact information is:  Manuel 
Calderon, Head of the Scientific Evaluation Section for 
CITES, Office of Biodiversity, Ministry of Environment and 
Rural and Marine Affairs, 34.91.749.3849, mcalderon@mma.es.
