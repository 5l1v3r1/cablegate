Econoff delivered reftel points on July 21 to Juan Luis Munoz

the American Bureau of Shipping's (ABS) proposed resolution, 
which had previously been given to the Spanish government by 
ABS's attorneys.  Munoz said that the competency for this 
issue was with the Ministry of Justice but that the MFA would 
pass the following points to the appropriate authorities in 
the Justice Ministry: 
 
-1. That the USG is interested in this case and would like to 
see an amicable resolution that meets the needs of all 
parties involved. 
 
-2. That the USG hopes that the GOS gives serious 
consideration to ABS's proposal and engages in meaningful 
discussions to find a mutually agreed upon resolution. 
 
-3. That the USG would like to be kept informed about the 
progress of the case. 
 
Post stands ready to further engage the Spanish government on 
this issue should further information be required.
