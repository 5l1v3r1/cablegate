Â¶1.  Reftel points are being conveyed to Director General for 
External Policy and Common Security Carlos Fernandez-Arias, 
who was enroute to Brussels today.   His staff is 
transmitting to Fernandez-Arias our unclassified nonpaper 
with key points regarding tomorrow's NAC discussion of events 
in Georgia.  Reftel points were also conveyed to the MFA 
office of European and North American Policy and the Office 
of the Deputy Foreign Minister.  At this time, with most of 
the MFA staff out of the country or on vacation, Spanish 
diplomats are not able to share a substantive response to our 
demarche.
