SUBJECT: SPAIN CONTINUES TO SEEK EU CONSENSUS FOR 
ABSTENTION ON GOLDSTONE VOTE

¶1.  (SBU) PolOff conveyed reftel A points to Marcelino 
Cabanas, the MFA's Subdirector General for United Nations and 
Global Issues.  Cabanas thanked Poloff for sharing what he 
called a "traditional view" but he indicated that Spain, 
during its rotating presidency of the Council of the European 
Union, had no national position, per se, on the matter of the 
Goldstone Report other than to seek consensus among all EU 
members.  He indicated Spain was still working as of February 
25 on a consensus position on the Palestinian-drafted 
resolution to follow up on the Goldstone Report. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) MFA's Human Rights Office Director Juan Duarte 
clarified February 26 that EU members states had failed to 
reach a common position at February 22 meetings in Brussels 
and remained divided in three camps on the upcoming vote. 
Spain shares in principle U.S. concerns re potential negative 
fallout to the peace process (ref A), but is striving to 
reach a common position on the Goldstone report among 27 
member states, a task Duarte described as "not easy at all." 
"As president of the EU," Duarte assured Poloff, Spain is 
"trying for consensus for abstention."  Duarte was unsure of 
prospects for success, but ventured that a no vote from all 
Europeans was unrealistic. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Most EU members are leaning toward a yes vote, 
reflecting their appreciation for improvements in the 
Palestinian text, which most would see now as "quite 
acceptable."  The GOS views the resolution as "quite 
procedural."  Duarte observed Spain had objected to the 
mention of a 5-month time period for follow-up, and that the 
Palestinians had eliminated it.  Spain continues to pulse 
other EU members, but believes that the UK will vote yes and 
that Germany is inclined to abstain.  Some countries that 
would not be able to vote yes will perhaps abstain.  Duarte 
conceded the distant possibility that the resolution could be 
adopted without no vote at all, saying Spain "would love 
that." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Asked why Spain placed such emphasis on EU consensus 
in a UN matter, especially one as admittedly challenging as 
the situation in Gaza, Duarte reiterated the importance for 
Spain and the EU of striving for a common position on 
Goldstone or on any other less delicate issue, consensus 
among the 27 being critical if the EU were to have any 
influence (ref B).
