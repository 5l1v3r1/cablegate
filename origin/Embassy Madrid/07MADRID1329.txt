In separate communications June 20 and July 5, EconOffs 
delivered the U.S. positions described in reftels to Barbara 
Trincado, Chief of the International Relations section at 
Ministry of Public Work's Civil Aviation Directorate. 
Trincado indicated to EconOff July 5 that Spain did not have 
a formal position with respect to reftel demarches. She 
assured EmbOff that she will contact the Embassy in the 
upcoming weeks should Spain develop a position.  Post will 
follow up to seek input prior to the September meeting.
