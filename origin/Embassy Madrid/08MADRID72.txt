REF: STATE 7232 
 
(SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Spanish Deputy DG 
for Human Rights Fernando Fernandez-Arias on January 24, 
urging EU nations to vote against the resolution tabled by 
the OIC, rather than abstain.  Fernandez-Arias said that EU 
consensus was broken at present, and that it was possible 
some states would vote against and the rest would abstain. 
Spain was advocating for a strong consensus explanation of 
vote in the event of EU abstention.  Fernandez-Arias admitted 
that he had not yet talked to Geneva and was not sure of the 
latest state of play.  Poloff emphasized that the resolution 
was completely unbalanced and made no mention of the 
provocative rocket attacks into Israel.
