Stimulus/Reform Package Approved 
 
¶1. (U) On August 18, the GOS published the list of measures 
agreed to in the August 14 extraordinary Council of Ministers 
session (ref A).  The package includes 24 economic stimulus 
measures and structural reforms to be implemented with a 
specific timeline in 2009 and 2010.  Many of these proposals 
had been previously announced (ref B), and while considered 
to be useful and beneficial by most, are unlikely to have an 
immediate impact on the economic slowdown.  The measures 
include 20 billion euros in credit and loan guarantees line 
subsidies for small and medium size business and for those 
wishing to purchase government sponsored housing (price 
controlled housing meant for lower and middle income 
families).  The package also includes measures related to 
energy and climate change and the transportation, telecom and 
services sectors.  (All media, 8/18; Moncloa website, 8/18) 
 
Loan Delinquency Rates Up Significantly in June 
 
¶2. (U) According to the Bank of Spain, June delinquency 
levels on loans (defined as 3 months overdue) increased to a 
rate of 1.7 percent.  While this level overall may appear 
low, what is striking is that it represents a significant 
increase from June of the year before, when the rate was 0.8 
percent.  Savings banks ("cajas") have been affected to a 
greater extent given that up to 70 percent of their loans are 
in some way related to the slowing housing market.  According 
to the president of the Savings Bank Association (CECA), Juan 
Ramon Quintas, the average loan delinquency rate for all 
savings banks is expected to reach over 2 percent in 2008 and 
potentially over 4 percent in 2009.  Comment:  Second Vice 
President and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes says the 
Spanish financial system is strong and that financial 
institutions in Spain have the reserves to deal with these 
increases.  While it is true that Spain,s central bank 
requires all banks to have higher "cushion" levels than are 
required in other EU countries, the rapid increase in loan 
delinquency rates is still somewhat worrisome.  (El Pais, 
8/19; Expansion, 8/22) 
 
Industrial Production Down in June 
 
¶3. (U) Industrial production in June was 9% below its June 
2007 level.  Production for the first six months of the year 
was 2.8% below its level for the first half of 2007.  (Cinco 
Dias, 8/19) 
 
International Tourism Down in July 
 
¶4. (U) The number of foreign tourists coming to Spain in July 
was 8% below the number in July 2007.  For the year through 
July, the number was up only 0.2%.  Spain is the world's 
second leading destination for international tourists. 
Arrivals from the UK, France, and Germany -- Spain's top 
three sources of tourists -- all fell significantly. 
Industry, Tourism, and Commerce Minister Sebastian cited 
economic difficulties in source countries as a leading cause 
for the poor summer tourism season, while others also say 
Spanish tourism is less competitive than it used to be. 
(Comment: The stronger euro might play a role in price 
competitiveness, both in reducing arrivals from non-Euro 
countries and making it more attractive for Euro-country 
tourists to go elsewhere.)  (Expansion, 8/22; Cinco Dias, 
8/20) 
 
Industry Minister Plans Significant Fine for Nuclear Plant 
Leak Mishandling 
¶5. (U) Industry, Tourism, and Commerce Minister Sebastian 
said his ministry would apply a significant fine, as 
recommended by the Consejo de Seguridad Nuclear regulatory 
agency, against power company Endesa for mishandling a 
 
MADRID 00000921  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
November 2007 radioactive leak at its Asco I nuclear power 
plant in Tarragona.  Sebastian said the MITC would open an 
investigation next month to validate CSN,s findings that 
Endesa committed a "grave error of the maximum degree" by not 
detecting the leak until March 2008 and then waiting nearly a 
month to report it to CSN.  CSN has recommended that MITC 
fine Endesa between 9 and 22.5 million euros (US$13-33 
million).  Sebastian noted that his ministry has up to three 
years to impose the fine, but he intends to act quickly. 
(Comment:  The Asco leak and Endesa,s mishandling of it are 
likely to increase public skepticism over calls to expand 
nuclear power.  A recent opinion poll indicated that 48% of 
the Spanish public is against the expansion of nuclear power 
while 40% favors expansion.  The Zapatero government plans to 
close existing plants as the end of their expected life spans 
are reached and does not plan to approve new ones, although 
concerns over electricity cost and climate change have 
prompted calls for a reconsideration of this policy.)

FCC Buys Babcock & Brown Wind Farms for 780M Euros 
 
¶6. (U) Barcelona-based FCC, one of Spain,s largest 
construction companies, has agreed to acquire the Australian 
firm Babcock and Brown,s Spanish wind energy assets for 780 
million euros ($1.2 billion).  FCC's acquisition, part of a 4 
billion-euro initiative to diversify into renewable energy, 
energy efficiency and waste-to-power technologies, includes 
fourteen wind parks with a combined capacity of 421 megawatts 
(MW), and an additional 45 MW currently under construction. 
This is about 3% of Spain's total wind power capacity.  A new 
business unit, FCC Energia, will manage the newly acquired 
assets, which the company says it expects to provide 
operating margins significantly higher than those of its core 
business.  (Comment:  FCC is following major construction 
companies Acciona and ACS in diversifying into renewable 
energy.)  (El Mundo, 8/21; Bloomberg, 8/21; FCC press release
