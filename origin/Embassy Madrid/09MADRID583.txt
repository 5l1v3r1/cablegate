1.(U) On June 15, Econoff discussed reftel points with Amb. 
Rafael Matos Gonzalez, Special Ambassador for Energy Affairs. 
 Matos welcomed the news that the USG is  considering joining 
IRENA.  He said IRENA is  "direct and practical." Matos 
confirmed Spain's support for the UAE's bid to house IRENA's 
headquarters; the U.S. can expect Spain's support on this 
issue at the Cairo meeting. 
 
¶2. (U) Matos downplayed the concern that IRENA will duplicate 
efforts of other energy organizations, noting that the IEA,s 
reaction to the development of IRENA is a "classic argument" 
of an organization seeking to defend its turf.   In 
clarifying the differences of IRENA as compared to other 
energy agencies, he stated that the scope of IRENA is 
"universal," open to all UN members and not regional.   IRENA 
is focused on the potential of renewable energy, diversifying 
the energy supply, promoting energy security, preventing 
climate change, and reducing carbon emissions. 
 
¶3. (U) Matos made a point of noting that IRENA is a tool for 
development and public awareness.  He stated that IRENA will 
be used as a tool to finance developing state renewable 
energy projects as well as to facilitate the transfer of 
technology and knowledge to developing states. Matos stated 
that there will be a capacity building function to IRENA. 
Matos expected ratification of IRENA to move forward very 
quickly within the GOS, but he did not offer a date. 
 
4.(U) Matos asked for USG support for Spain,s DG  candidate, 
Juan M. Ormazabal Jordana. Ormazabal is Director  Genergal of 
CENER (National Center of Renewable Energy), a  private 
foundation financed by public funds with a mission to 
facilitate the development of renewable energy in Spain and 
other countries through research, development, and 
innovation.  Post has forwarded Ormazabal,s CV to EEB, OES, 
and IO.
