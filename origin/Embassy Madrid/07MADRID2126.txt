¶1.  In a Nov. 8 meeting with DCM, GoS Secretary General 
(Vice-Minister) of Environment for Prevention of Pollution 
and Climate Change Arturo Aizpiri emphasized Spain,s desire 
to be part of the inner group of countries focusing on a 
solution to global climate change.  Aizpiri noted the GoS' 
concern that it was not invited to directly participate in 
September,s Major Economies Meeting in Washington, despite 
having one of the ten largest economies in the world.  Spain 
thinks it has a lot to contribute to the challenge of global 
climate change, both as a major emitter and because of its 
innovative renewable energy sector.  Aizpiri also pointed out 
that Spanish President Zapatero had, along with President 
Bush and others, attended U.N. SecGen Ban,s climate change 
dinner in New York in September. 
 
¶2. Aizpiri acknowledged and expressed the GOS,s appreciation 
for the seriousness of the USG in efforts to address global 
climate change.  Aizpiri specifically mentioned the 
high-level USG delegation attending the following week,s 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change conference in 
Valencia.  Aizpiri added that the GOS looked forward to 
working with the USG and other key players beginning in Bali 
to develop a post-2012 framework on emissions. 
 
¶3. Post had requested the meeting to inform Aizpiri of 
Post,s strategy for bilateral cooperation on renewable 
energy, including a Spanish government-business mission to 
Washington and Colorado planned for mid-February (Ref A). 
Aizpiri had spoken with Industry and Commerce Vice-Minister 
Mejia about the mission and expressed enthusiasm about 
participating.  He said he considered the challenge of 
addressing global climate change to be linked very closely to 
the development of renewable energy.  The renewable energy 
industry in Spain has experienced rapid growth recently and 
Spanish companies have become world leaders, in part because 
of GoS incentives for renewable electricity projects (Ref B).
