¶1. We delivered ref A&B demarches July 15 to Manuel de la 
Iglesia, Chief of Cabinet to the Secretary of State for 
International Cooperation, and Francisco Javier Jimenez de 
Gregorio, Chief of Cabinet to the Secretary General of the 
Spanish Agency for International Development.  Spain's total 
assistance to Haiti for 2004 will amount to EUR 900,000 (USD 
720,000) in food aid and emergency assistance.  This number 
is significantly higher than the EUR 300,000 pledged after 
our earlier Haiti appeal (ref c).

Leire Pajin visited Haiti July 11-13 to meet with Haitian 
government officials and other donors active in Haiti.  The 
Spanish delegation at the July 19-20 Donors' Conference will 
announce a new Spanish bilateral cooperation plan with Haiti 
focusing on governance, health, education, food security, 
access to potable water and economic development.  The 
Spanish delegation will be headed by Spain's ambassador to 
Haiti Paulino Gonzalez Fernandez-Corugedo.  Gonzalez will be 
accompanied by Deputy Director General for Cooperation with 
Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean Rafael Garranzo, 
Spanish Embassy Haiti's Commercial Counselor Luis Ruiz 
Arbeloa and Monica Colomer.
