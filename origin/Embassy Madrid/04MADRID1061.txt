SUBJECT: SPANISH RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE RE ROAD SAFETY 
 
REF: STATE 55662 
 
¶1.  We delivered reftel demarche to the MFA, the Ministry of 
the Interior, the Ministry of Public Works, and the Ministry 
of Health and Consumer Affairs. 
 
¶2.  In follow-up conversations with Ana Paredes, Subdirector 
General of Services for Technical Bodies and Rosario Bernal 
Garcia, Head of Services for Technical Bodies, MFA, they 
agreed that the Economic Commission for Europe,s Working 
Party 1 (WP.1) has technical expertise in road safety related 
issues.  Paredes noted, however, that the WP.1 currently has 
"geographical limitations" and assignment of additional 
responsibilities would significantly expand its scope.  The 
GOS is not opposed to the USG position and will enter the 
meetings with an "open mind."  Bernal requested USG views on 
whether the WP.1, if designated, should receive additional 
funding to fulfill these expanded duties. 
 
¶3.  The Spanish delegations have not yet been determined. 
Paredes said that Jose Miguel Corbinos, Counselor, Embassy of 
Spain in Paris will be a part of the delegation for the Paris 
meeting.  Bernal anticipates that members of the Spanish 
Mission to the United Nations will likewise attend the 
meeting in New York.  Bernal promised to inform us when the 
delegates were named.
