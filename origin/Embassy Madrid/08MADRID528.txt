DIRECTOR GENERAL 
 
REF: STATE 47559 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Summary: Spain wants to see a technically qualified 
candidate lead the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO).  In the end, largely because of the controversy 
surrounding Kamil Idris' early departure, Spain does not 
think it will be possible for a candidate from an 
industrialized country to win enough votes to become Director 
General.  There will be no consensus EU candidate.  End 
Summary 
 
¶2. (SBU) In Spain, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has 
the lead on UN agency candidate selection decisions.  With 
respect to the World Intellectual Property Organization 
(WIPO), the Spanish Ministry of Culture, which occasionally 
sends a representative to WIPO meetings, also has a certain 
amount of influence on Spanish policy.  The Culture 
Ministry's Subdirector General for Intellectual Property, 
Pedro Colmenares, told EconOff on May 8 that Spain thought 
that Mexico's Jorge Amigo would make a good candidate. 
However, Colmenares suggested that EconOff go to the MFA for 
a more definitive Spanish position. 
 
¶3. (SBU) EconOff spoke on May 12 with MFA Subdirector for 
International Economic Organizations, Enrique Yturriaga 
Saldanha.  Yturriaga told EconOff that there will be no 
common EU position at the upcoming May 14 WIPO meeting 
because of the 15 candidates, four are from the EU. 
Yturriaga said that Spain would have no objection to Amigo, 
but that Amigo's candidacy might be fatally flawed because he 
did not have the full support of the regional group that 
Mexico belongs to given Brazil's "strong" candidate.  The 
Kenyan candidate might be a good option because he was 
technically qualified and might assuage African sensibilities 
over Idris' early departure.  From Spain's perspective, the 
Australian candidate was also a good possibility. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: According to Colmenares, there will likely 
be several rounds of voting.  Besides getting a qualified 
candidate for the position, Spain is also keen to increase 
its representation in WIPO so that will likely also be a 
factor in Spanish decisionmaking.
