SUBJECT: SPAIN: FM MORATINOS TO ATTEND BMENA FORUM FOR THE 
FUTURE MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 189502 
 
MFA Subdirector for the Middle East Alberto Moreno confirmed 
on November 20 that Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel 
Moratinos would attend the Forum for the Future meeting in 
Jordan.  Moreno said that the key for Spain was the 
Secretary's participation in the event; since she will be 
 
SIPDIS 
there, Moratinos will attend as well.  He did not request a 
bilateral meeting for Moratinos, but we anticipate that Spain 
will make such a request at some point.
