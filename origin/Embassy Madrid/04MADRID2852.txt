¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche July 15 to Luis Felipe 
Fernandez de la Pena, Special Ambassador for 
Counterterrorism, and Juan Antonio Aliaga Mendez, the 
Ministry of Economy's Deputy Director for Inspection and 
Control of Capital Movements.  In a July 22 meeting, Desk 
Officer Miguel Garcia-Herraiz Roobaert of the International 
Terrorism Unit, informed us that the MFA forwarded the CIRA 
names to the Ministry of Interior and the Spanish 
Intelligence Agency; the Ministry of Economy forwarded the 
names to the Spanish financial intelligence unit (SEPBLAC). 
Garcia-Herraiz also noted that CIRA was already listed as a 
terrorist organization by the EU and if the banks locate any 
funds, they are obligated to report the accounts to the 
authorities for asset freezing.  He expressed doubt, however, 
that any CIRA funds exist in Spain.  In the event funds are 
located, he promised to contact us.
