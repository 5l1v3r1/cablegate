¶1. We delivered reftel points to the Ministries of 
Environment and Industry, Tourism and Trade.  Juan Martinez 
Sanchez, Environment Ministry Subdirector General for 
Environmental Quality, responded May 18 that the new 
Socialist Administration is currently studying the draft 
regulation and therefore has no official position at this 
time.  He said, however, that Spain's position has 
historically been in line with the European Commission's 
initial proposal. 
 
¶2. We will report any further reactions as we receive them.
