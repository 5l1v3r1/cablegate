Â¶1. In separate discussions mid-June, EconOffs passed reftel 
points to Carolina Mayeur Dawel, Director of Middle East, 
Africa, and Western Europe Affairs at the Spanish Agency for 
International Cooperation (AECI).  EconOffs encouraged 
Spanish contributions to UNWRA, particularly in response to 
the recent UNWRA flash appeal.  On June 18, Mayeur pointed to 
the recent announcement that Spain would contribute 600,000 
euros for the UNWRA flash appeal.  Additionally, Mayeur noted 
that over the course of the year, Spain had approved a total 
UNRWA contribution of 4 million euros for emergency projects 
for Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and in Gaza.
