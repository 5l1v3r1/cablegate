 ¶1.  Reftel B talking points and Secretary Rice's letter were 
conveyed to FM Moratinos last week via a cover letter from 
the Charge.  In addition to the Foreign Minister, we also 
delivered the points to contacts at the Ministry of Culture 
and Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism. 
 
¶2.  We will deliver the letter from Secretary Gutierrez and 
Reftel A talking points to Minister of Industry, Trade and 
Tourism Jose Montilla this afternoon (October 14), with an 
advance fax copy to his Chief of Cabinet.  We will follow up 
with the Chief of Cabinet Monday morning to encourage Spanish 
support for our position. 
 
¶3.  Comment:  Although we've been told by trade contacts that 
they understand our position in technical terms, the Ministry 
of Culture has the firm lead on this issue and there is 
little sympathy for our position there.
