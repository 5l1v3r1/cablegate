REF: SECSTATE 140757 
 
¶1.  This is an action request for IO/T and EB/CIP/TS - see 
para 4. 
 
¶2.  ESTHOFF passed reftel diplomatic note and candidacy 
materials August 30 to MFA Director of Air, Maritime and Land 
Cooperation Juan Luis Munoz de Laborde, urging Spain to 
support the U.S. candidate for the Directorship of the 
International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO) in the 
event that the Spanish candidate was eliminated from the 
competition.  De Laborde said that he would pass our request 
to the MFA's international candidacies office, which was 
awaiting the arrival of a new director.  That said, he 
confirmed that he was the subject matter expert that would 
guide the candidacy office's formal response and he stated 
that our request "was reasonable." 
 
¶3.  Post will report any further contact we have with either 
De Laborde or the MFA candidacy office.  In the meantime, we 
will also contact the Spanish Industry Ministry POC provided 
in reftel and report his reaction. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST:  The Spanish may request a 
similar commitment from the U.S.  In other words, they may 
ask for the U.S. to support their candidate in the event that 
the U.S. candidate is eliminated prior to the Spaniard.  Post 
requests Department guidance regarding how to respond to any 
such Spanish offer.
