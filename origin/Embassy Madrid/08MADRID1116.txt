 ¶1.  (SBU) POLOFF met Carlos Torres, MFA Counselor for 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament, on October 22 to 
deliver REFTEL A demarche. Torres said that he will serve as 
point of contact (POC) for the Defense Threat Reduction 
Agency for matters related to the Global Initiative 
Information Portal (GIIP) and informed POLOFF that Spain, 
which has been busy all year hosting a number of Global 
Initiative events, already has roughly 60 accounts activated 
with the GIIP. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Torres reviewed the existing draft of POC's listed 
for Spain as part of REFTEL B and asked that Carmen Bujan 
Freire, Director General for Strategic Affairs and Terrorism 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, be added 
to the top of the list for Spanish POCs. Torres requested 
that, if formal invitations will be issued to the November 
13-14, 2008 meeting of the GI's Exercise Planning Group in 
Washington, DC, as discussed in REFTEL C, then it would be 
best for the invitation to the Spanish delegation to be 
addressed to Bujan. 
 
¶3. (U) Other changes to Spain's portion of the GI POC list 
and contact information for the GI Coordinating Officer in 
Embassy Madrid have been sent by unclassified email to Molly 
Sergio and Sarah Prescott of ISN/FM WMDT, as directed in 
REFTELS A and B.
