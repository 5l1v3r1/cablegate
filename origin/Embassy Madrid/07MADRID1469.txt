REF: STATE 102149 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On July 24 Poloff delivered REFTEL to Ignacio 
Sanchez, MFA Deputy Director General for Nonproliferation and 
Disarmament.  Sanchez confirmed that Spain was one of the 23 
states to have signed and ratified the International 
Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism 
(NTC).  He said that Spain chose to be in the leading group 
of countries to accede to this treaty due to its commitment 
to fight terrorism, and it is actively lobbying third 
countries to join the convention as well.  Sanchez described 
Spain's national legislation on terrorism as "quite 
extensive," due to Spain's long history with ETA, and now 
Islamic terrorist threats.  Sanchez said his government looks 
forward to U.S. ratification of the treaty.
