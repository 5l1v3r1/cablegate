(SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Juan Manuel 
Gonzalez de Linares, MFA Deputy DG for UN affairs, on May 3. 
The EU and Spain will not support Zimbabwe's candidacy to 
chair the 16th Commission on Sustainable Development. 
Linares told Poloff that Zimbabwean Environment Minister 
Nhema is on the EU no-visa list.  Additionally, Zimbabwe 
should not be the chair of any group whose themes are 
agriculture and rural development.  However, Linares said 
that the African group has claimed there is no time to search 
for a new candidate.  Spain would like a secret vote in New 
York, by which the EU and U.S. can impel the African group to 
seek a new candidate.  Spain is willing to coordinate with 
other like-minded countries in the CSD in seeking a vote 
against Zimbabwe.  Linares cautioned that any move to exclude 
Zimbabwe from the chair should be taken with extreme care, 
isolating Zimbabwe and avoiding the appearance of rejecting 
the entire African group.
