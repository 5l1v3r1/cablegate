SUBJECT: 2005 ICCAT CONTRIBUTION 
 
¶1.  Embassy received a letter dated December 14 from the 
Madrid-based International Commission for the Conservation of 
Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) requesting payment of the U.S.'s 2005 
dues of 148,810.15 euros.  The letter indicates that payment 
can be made either via an international bank draft, payable 
to ICCAT and sent to its Executive Secretary, or via a bank 
transfer to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), Oficina 
Institucional No. 1, Calle Alcala, 16, Madrid 28014.  The 
BBVA account numbers are IBAN ES 94 0182 5906 8702 00173290 
for euro deposits or IBAN ES 30 0182 5906 8420 10012035 for 
U.S. dollar deposits.  If the deposit is made in U.S. 
dollars, the amount received will be converted to euros at 
the official UN exchange rate in effect on the date of 
notification of the deposit to the ICCAT account. 
 
¶2.  The letter indicates that copies were sent to Secretary 
Powell, Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Head Delegate of the 
U.S. to ICCAT W.T. Hogarth, and Chairman of the ICCAT 
Standing Committee on Finance and Administration (STACFAD) J. 
Jones.  Embassy will fax a copy of the letter and its 
attachments to OES/OMC (Dierdre Warner-Kramer). 
 
¶3.  COMMENT:  The U.S. only paid its 2004 dues in September 
2004, after receipt of at least one "reminder" from ICCAT. 
The delay was reportedly caused by insufficient Congressional 
appropriations which required funds to be reprogrammed prior 
to payment.
