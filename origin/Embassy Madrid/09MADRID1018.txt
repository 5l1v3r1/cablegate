¶1. (SBU) POLOFF and Political Counselor Dmitry Sokolov of the 
Russian Embassy on October 15 delivered reftel demarche to 
Gonzalo de Salazar, the MFA's Deputy DG for Non-Proliferation 
and Disarmament and Monica Colomer de Selva, Counselor for 
Non-Proliferation and Disarmament in the MFA's DG for 
Strategic Affairs & Terrorism. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Salazar was intrigued by news that the USG and 
Russia - in their capacities as co-Chairs of the Global 
Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) - were 
reviewing the Terms of Reference for the GICNT to support 
enhanced implementation of the Initiative's activities. 
Informed that this was part of an initiative to strengthen 
the GICNT, Salazar asked whether this was part of an effort 
to establish the GICNT as a formal institution with a 
Secretary General and a headquarters.  POLOFF replied that 
details of the proposal were as yet unavailable but would be 
provided in advance of the Exercise Planning Group (EPG) 
Meeting on January 19, 2010 and that GICNT partners would 
have the opportunity to review the proposal beforehand to 
enable them to come prepared to discuss the proposal at that 
meeting.
