¶1.  ESTHOFF made reftel points January 5 to MFA Deputy 
Director General for International Economic Relations Juan 
Luis Munoz de Laborde, asking about the status of Spanish 
ratification of U.S.-EU GPS Galileo Cooperation Agreement and 
whether Spain plans to mandate that GOS entities utilize 
Galileo for future spaced-based positioning, navigation and 
timing (PNT) needs.  Munoz de Laborde offered the following 
information: 
 
--  Spain ratified the U.S.-EU GPS Galileo Cooperation 
Agreement on May 8, 2006. 
 
--  Spain does not plan to subsidize the operation of 
Galileo, as the EU agreement that launched Galileo called for 
the system to be run as a private consortium. 
 
--  Per EU agreement, Spain and other EU states have and will 
continue to subsidize the construction and launching of the 
satellites that will put Galileo in place.  These monies are 
passed via the European Space Agency. 
 
--  Spain does not plan to mandate that GOS entities use 
Galileo for future PNT needs.  Spanish government agencies 
will be free to contract with GPS, GLONASS, or other 
competitors in the PNT market. 
 
¶2.  The Spanish press reports that Spain has committed to pay 
10 percent of the expected 3.6 billion euro cost to develop 
and launch the 30 Galileo satellites that will be put in 
orbit by 2011.  This would make Spain the EU's fifth largest 
supplier of such funds.  The press reports that Spain has 
provided 105 million euro to date and that the balance of 
Madrid's 360 million euro contribution will be provided prior 
to 2011.
