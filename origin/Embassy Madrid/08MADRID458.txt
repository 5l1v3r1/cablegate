REF: STATE 40303 
 
¶1.  In response to reftel demarche, Deputy Director General 
Alberto Ucelay told us that Foreign Minister Moratinos will 
attend the May 2 AHCL in London.  Ucelay said that the 
Spanish MFA had already given the Norwegians input that the 
AHLC's primary focus should be energizing the international 
community to continue the initiatives discussed at the 
Annapolis Conference.  Spain agrees that it is essential to 
make progress in specific areas affecting Palestinian 
economic development, especially access and movement.  Spain 
will also work to increase support for Prime Minister Fayyad 
and President Abbas. 
 
¶2. According to Ucelay, Spain was the first EU member state 
to utilize the new PEGASE mechanism to contribute funds 
directly to the Palestinian single treasury account.  Spain 
deposited 20 million euros to the Palestinians in the last 
several weeks with the intention of supporting May salary 
payments for Palestinian National Authority officials, in 
accordance with the priorities determined by Abbas and Fayyad. 
 
¶3. Spain shares our concerns about the situation in Gaza. 
The Spanish MFA issued an official communique April 17 
calling for all parties to end violence and exercise 
restraint. Ucelay said that FM Moratinos looked forward to 
working with our team in London.
