REF: A. AMBASSADOR AGUIRRE'S E-MAILS OF 3/17/2008 
 
     ¶B. MADRID 283 
 
¶1.  (U) On March 13, Ambassador Aguirre hosted a follow-up 
meeting with Omar Pernet and Alejandro Gonzlez-Raga. The 
two, until recently, had been political prisoners in Cuba. 
Both of these remarkable individuals individually pressed the 
Ambassador to personally convey their gratitude to President 
Bush for his support of Cuban political prisoners, Cuban 
dissidents, and a democratic Cuba. 
 
¶2.  (U) Omar Pernet recounted how, in prison, he hid a small 
transistor radio inside a bar of soap. Late at night, he 
would listen to Radio Marti, hearing messages from President 
Bush. Those messages nourished his soul and kept him alive! 
Pernet, in particular, mentioned how much he appreciated the 
President,s mentioning him by name during remarks made at 
the State Department on October 24, 2007. President Bush had 
invited Mr. Pernet, s family to be present as well, honoring 
them and Omar during his statement. Omar and Alejandro 
earnestly expressed their gratitude for the President,s past 
statements and the solidarity of the United States with the 
people of Cuba. They appreciated the Ambassador,s message 
that, to them, the Madrid Residence is also President Bush,s 
home in Spain. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Ambassador and the Embassy staff have been in 
personal contact with four recently freed Cuban political 
prisoners who arrived in Spain about a month ago. Cuban and 
Spanish authorities met in Madrid on February 11, as part of 
a revived Spain-Cuba Human Rights Dialogue. Spain provided 
Cuba a list of names of prisoners of concern, including Oscar 
Biscet. Less than a week later, up to seven prisoners were 
released (of course, Biscet was not among them) and four from 
the group of 75 arrested in 2003 were allowed to travel to 
Spain for medical treatment. They and their immediate 
families arrived in Madrid on February 17. 
 
¶4.  (U) On March 4, soon after their arrival in Madrid, Omar 
Pernet, Jos Gabriel Ramn Castillo, Pedro Pablo Alvarez 
Ramos, and Alejandro Gonzlez-Raga were invited for a group 
meeting with the Ambassador and his wife at his Residence 
(ref B). Over coffee, they told the story of their sudden 
release and whirlwind trip to Spain. They were encouraged to 
share any concerns or requests. Since such a setting is a 
little cumbersome, for four individuals to compete for time 
to tell their compelling stories, the Ambassador offered to 
meet with each of them individually to discuss their 
particular situations. Omar and Alejandro returned March 13 
for their individualized visit. The discussion centered on 
Cuba,s democratic future, their own status in Spain, their 
medical conditions, and their concerns on behalf of family 
members in the United States as well as in Cuba. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Their situation here is unique. They are 
completely dependent for their subsistence on the GOS and the 
goodwill of the Cuban community. They are trying to formalize 
their understanding with the GOS of future assistance, to 
what extent, and for how long. Each of them will have to make 
decisions about long-term plans, employment, and asylum or 
residency based on his individual and familial circumstances. 
 
¶6.  (U) While their welfare is primarily the concern of the 
GOS, we have established ties to these dissidents and plan to 
stay in close touch.  We will also encourage senior Spanish 
officials to meet with them and hear of their experiences and 
hopes for a democratic Cuba.  We also plan to respond with 
prompt and accurate information about U.S. visa laws, and 
provide VIP customer service at our Consular Section, should 
they wish to apply for visas to visit family members in the 
United States. 
AGUIRRE
