REF: SECSTATE 236869 
 
Poloff discussed reftel talking points with the MFA's 
Director General for Human Rights, Jose Antonio de Ory Peral. 
 Spain was directly involved in EU efforts on the Belarus, 
Turkmenistan, Sudan, and Zimbabwe human rights resolutions. 
All 25 EU member states are behind EU positions and must vote 
for the common EU positions on the aforementioned 
resolutions.  Spain, as well as the other EU members, will 
co-sponsor the Canadian resolution on human rights problems 
in Iran.  De Ory was unaware of the circulation of a 
Belarusian retaliatory resolution against the U.S., but he 
said that Spain would make clear to the Belarusians that they 
will vote against an anti-US resolution; he added that it 
would be inconceivable for Spain to do otherwise, considering 
their strong support of the resolution condemning Belarus.
