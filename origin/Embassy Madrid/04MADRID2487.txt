(SBU) Marcos Rodriguez in the MFA's Office of International 
Disarmament Affairs told us June 28 that Spain would support 
the U.S. proposal for a technical change to the Chemical 
Weapons Convention during the June 29-July 2 Executive 
Council meeting.  The response advanced Spain's previously 
undecided position given during our June 24 meeting with 
Rodriguez (ref B).
