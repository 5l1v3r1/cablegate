SUBJECT: ABDELRAZIK MAKES ROUTINE COURT APPEARANCE, SAYS SEEKS 
JUSTICE 
 
REF: OTTAWA 478; OTTAWA 469 
 
¶1. (U) Newly repatriated Abousfian Abdelrazik appeared briefly 
before a federal court judge in Montreal yesterday, officially 
affirming that Ottawa had complied with the court's June 4 order 
to bring Abdelrazik home after six years in exile in Sudan. 
Judge Russel Zinn, the same judge who had issued the order, 
welcomed Abdelrazik back but refused his request to thank the 
court.  Zinn said that thanks were unnecessary because the court 
had treated Abdelrazik in the same manner as it would treat any 
Canadian citizen. 
 
¶2. (U) Abdelrazik told reporters that he desired for those "who 
played a role in this matter to face justice."  His lawyers 
added that they had not ruled out seeking a formal apology or 
compensation similar to that offered to another Canadian, Maher 
Arar, who received $10 million from Canada for its role in his 
deportation to Syria where he was subsequently tortured.
