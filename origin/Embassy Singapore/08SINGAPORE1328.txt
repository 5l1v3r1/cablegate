REF. USDOC 07055 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Application Number: D408150; Attention: OEA/532/M. 
Nickson/Antoinette Dyson- License Applicant: Symmetricom Inc. 2300 
Orchard Pkwy., San Jose, CA 95131, Contact: Ms. Susan Durr 
(408-964-9624). 
 
¶3. On Wednesday, December 17, 2008, CommAttache Todd Avery, Sr 
CommSpec Chia Swee Hoon and ICE Senior Special Agent Russell Perras, 
assigned to the Container Security Initiative in Singapore, visited 
Nera Telecommunications Ltd located at 109 Defu Lane 10, Singapore 
¶539225.  Emboffs met with Mr. Choakdee Dhamasaroj, SVP & Country 
Manager of Nera (Thailand) Limited, and three other officers from 
Nera Telecommunications Limited based in Singapore: Mr. Neo Aik Hoon 
(Manager, Systems Engineering & Customer Service, Microwave 
Network), Mr. Christopher P. Cortes (System Engineer, Transmission, 
Technical Support) and Mr. Wilson Lau (Operations Executive, 
Transmission Network) to brief them on U.S. export licensing 
procedures and requirements. 
 
¶4. From the interview, Emboffs established that Nera 
Telecommunications Ltd had successfully tendered for the Royal Thai 
Air Force (RTAF) Defense System Phase II contract worth 36 million 
Euros. Mr. Choakdee Dhamasaroj specifically flew into Singapore for 
the PLC as he is the Country Manager for Nera (Thailand) Limited 
that will be responsible for installing the telecommunication system 
at RTAF. He is familiar with the project and is aware of U.S. export 
regulations and licensing requirements for controlled items. Mr. 
Choakdee Dhamasaroj explained that Nera Telecommunictions Ltd 
participated in the tender instead of the Thailand office as it was 
better qualified to bid for the large tender. He further explained 
that the controlled commodity from Symmetricom Inc was one of 28 
products that will be integrated into the telecommunication system 
for the RTAF. The controlled product will be shipped to Singapore 
(instead of to Thailand directly) as all the 28 products have to be 
consolidated into one shipment to be re-exported to Thailand to 
facilitate Custom clearance by the end user - RAFT.  Wilson Lau 
clarified that when the controlled commodity arrives Singapore, Nera 
will not take physical delivery as it will remain in the FTZ and 
will be shipped directly from the FTZ. He said that his company uses 
two freight forwarders to handle the shipments: CTI Logistics and 
Hong Kong World Transit. 
 
¶5. Nera Telecommunications Ltd (with more than 100 staff in 
Singapore) is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Their officers 
were forthcoming with information and provided copies of quotation 
and purchase order for the controlled commodity. Emboffs visited all 
three floors of Nera's office in Singapore. 
 
¶6. On the basis of the inspection and the interview conducted, 
Emboffs are satisfied that Nera Telecommunications Ltd is a 
legitimate business concern that appears to be a reliable recipient 
of U.S. origin commodities.
