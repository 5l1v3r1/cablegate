¶1.  Post conducted a site visit to assess the business 
operations and on-site security of Fortuna Aerospace Supplies 
and Trading. 
 
¶2.  Fortuna Aerospace is a sole proprietorship that has been 
operating in Singapore since October 26, 1991.  Singapore's 
online business directory, Biznet, lists the company's 
principle officer as: 
 
Name: Eng Chew Wah (aka Simon Eng) 
Nationality: Singaporean 
ID: S1206508F 
Address: 171 Hougang Avenue 1, #11-1477, Singapore 
 
¶3.  DHS/ICE databases revealed no negative information about 
Fortuna Aerospace. 
 
¶4.  Econoffs visited Fortuna Aerospace on June 26 and met 
with Eng Boon Seng, Sales and Marketing Manager.  Eng 
confirmed that Fortuna had placed the order for the goods 
listed reftel.  Fortuna had been working with the Indonesian 
Armed Forces since 1991 and also supplied the Malaysian, 
Philippine, Sri Lankan, and Pakistan Armed Forces, according 
to Eng.  In the case of Pakistan, the business was limited to 
industrial goods.  Eng told us that approximately thirty 
percent of Fortuna's transactions required an export license 
application.  He said that he understood the restrictions on 
 
USML items and the importance of knowing the end-user. 
Fortuna's office is located in a commercial facility.  The 
company often stores equipment on-site before shipping it to 
the final destination, according to Eng.  The office itself 
was not alarmed, but the building employed an electronic 
surveillance system, he said. 
 
¶5.  Fortuna Aerospace appeared to be a legitimate business 
entity, and we believe it is a reliable party in this 
transaction.
