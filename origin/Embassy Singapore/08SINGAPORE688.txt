¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Application Number: D396138 ; Attention: OEA/532/M. Nickson / Jay 
Hatfield - License Applicant: Carbone of America, Graphite Material 
Division, 215 Stackpole Street, St. Mary's, PA 15857-1488, Contact: 
Ms. Roberta Y Dippold (814-781 8521). 
 
¶3. On Thursday, June 12 - 2008, CommAttache Todd Avery and CommSpec 
CHAN Y K visited Meiban Mold Manufacture Pte Ltd located at Meiban 
Industrial Building, 11 Ubi Road 1, Lobby B Level 3, Singapore 
¶139965. Emboffs met with Mr. LAU O S (Asst. General Manager - Tel: 
65-6846 2856 ; Fax: 65-6842 7655) and Mr. LEE Y P (Operation Manager 
- Tel: 65-6846 2819 ; Fax: 65-6842 2926) to brief them on U.S. 
export licensing procedures and requirements. 
 
¶4. From the interview, Emboffs established that Meiban, a contract 
manufacturing company and mold maker for the plastics industry, had 
no knowledge of the license applicant, the ultimate consignee or the 
specified order. Meiban stated that they do order graphite similar 
to that identified in the license application for their Electrical 
Discharge Machining (EDM) process from local distributors or from 
Japan but not in such large quantities.  To support their claim that 
they obtained their graphite material from Japan instead of the 
license applicant, Meiban provided copies of graphite orders from 
local and Japanese suppliers.  Mr. Lau indicated that the quantity 
on the license would last Meiban 'a few years' at their current 
capacity. According to Meiban, they typically use copper for their 
EDM process unless large parts are being machined.  They indicated 
that graphite is lighter and cheaper than copper, but not as 
effective for smaller parts. 
 
¶5. Meiban (with more than 5000 staff world wide) clarified that 
though they have Japanese shareholders, they are a Singapore company 
with a Singaporean CEO. Meiban showed Emboffs their shop floor and 
tool room where they produce parts for various MNCs such as HP, 
Oakley and Dyson. 
 
¶6. Emboffs also visited the address of ultimate consignee 
Engineering Source International Pte Ltd (ESI) at Blk 3015 Ubi Road 
1 #04-256, Singapore 408704, to discover that the company owning the 
premises was Meng Hoi Precision Pte Ltd who was renting a small 
space to ESI.  No one from ESI was there and Meng Hoi assisted 
Emboffs in contacting Mr. James SEOW who suggested that Emboffs meet 
him at his new office location in the Woodlands. 
 
¶7. On Friday, June 13 - 2008, CommAttache Todd Avery and CommSpec 
CHAN Y K visited ESI's new office located at Blk 20 Woodlands Link 
#09-34, Woodlands East Industrial Estate, Singapore 738733. Emboffs 
met with Mr. James SEOW (General Manager - Tel / Fax: 65-6583 3276 ; 
Mobile: 65-9368 3443) to brief him on U.S. export licensing 
procedures and requirements. 
 
¶8. ESI's office is located on the ninth floor in a typical Singapore 
industrial complex close to several plastic manufacturers.  The 
premises, which was under renovation, consisted of a small office 
area and larger storage/shop.  There are two entrances to the 
premises. 
 
¶9. From the interview, Emboffs confirmed that ESI was established in 
early 2008 and is the authorized distributor for Carbone of America 
in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Mr. Seow shared ESI's business 
plan and business registration with Emboffs.   Shareholders of ESI 
are Ms. Sharon Lucile from Oklahoma (70%), whose husband, Mr. 
Charles Turner, previously worked at Poco Graphite in Singapore and 
Mr. Seow's wife (30%).  Mr. Seow is the sole employee of ESI. 
 
¶10. Both Mr. Turner and Mr. Seow have several years mold making and 
tooling experience.  Mr. Seow stated that he was hired by Mr. Turner 
to work at Poco Graphite from 2002 - 2005 after which he worked for 
Graphite Carbon Technology Pte Ltd from 2005 until he left to set up 
ESI.  Mr. Seow's previous employer, Graphite Carbon Technology, is a 
supplier of graphite material from Japan to Meiban.  Mr. Seow also 
indicated that he currently has an import license for tooling 
equipment but will be checking if it can also be used for the 
graphite material. 
 
¶11. ESI clarified that they do not have any orders for the material 
identified in the license application and have not started marketing 
the new material in the region.  However, ESI feels that the 
quantity of material in the license application is equivalent to six 
months stock based on their estimates of overall market in 
 
 
Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.  Mr. Seow indicated that he is 
well aware of U.S. export licensing procedures and requirements and 
that securing the export license for the graphite material is key to 
the success of his new company. 
 
¶12. On the basis of the inspections and the interviews conducted, 
Emboffs are satisfied that Meiban is a legitimate business concern 
that purchases and uses material similar to that in the license 
application for legitimate commercial purposes.  Emboffs are also 
satisfied that ESI is also a legitimate business concern seeking to 
import the controlled commodity for legitimate business purposes, 
but is not yet a supplier to the end-user identified in the export 
license.
