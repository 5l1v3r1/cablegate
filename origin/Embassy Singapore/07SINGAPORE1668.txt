SUBJECT: COALITION FORCES ESSENTIAL TO IRAQ'S REBUILDING, 
IRAQI DEPUTY MINISTER TELLS SINGAPORE AUDIENCE 
 
 
¶1. (U) A premature withdrawal of Coalition forces from Iraq 
would harm the situation in Iraq, Iraqi Foreign Ministry 
Deputy Minister for Policy Planning, Labeed Majeed ABBAWI 
told a Singapore audience on September 6 at a forum on Iraq's 
foreign policy.  A major goal for the GOI is to convince its 
neighbors that the Coalition forces remain in Iraq at the 
government's request and should remain until the security 
situation becomes more stable.  Deputy Minister Abbawi said 
the sectarian violence that is so prevalent in news reports 
is not as severe at the grass roots level.  The overwhelming 
majority of Iraqis support national unity and even Kurds now 
refer to themselves as "Iraqi Kurds."  The GOI is carrying 
out a policy of national reconciliation that should lead to a 
reduction in sectarian violence.  Rifts in the government are 
political and not sectarian in nature, he asserted. 
 
¶2. (U) The GOI seeks to rebuild a society beaten down by 
"tyranny and then war."  This depends on raising and training 
security forces capable of defending Iraq against "all foes." 
 At the same time, the government has to strengthen the 
nation's economy by repairing the infrastructure, lowering 
inflation, and creating jobs.  Deputy Minister Abbawi 
stressed that countries like Singapore could assist in this 
process by sharing expertise in capacity building through 
training in management and doing business in a free-market 
economy.  He noted that Iraq would continue to pursue 
accession to the World Trade Organization and would work with 
the United Nations to implement the Iraqi Compact. 
 
¶3. (U) Deputy Minister Abbawi discussed the efforts by the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to re-establish itself.  It has 
already opened or re-opened missions in 70 countries and 
would be up to 86 by the end of the year.  Two "emergency" 
recruiting drives have added 120 new officers to its 
diplomatic corps.  25 countries have hosted these diplomats 
for training.  An additional 120 new diplomats are being 
trained in the new Iraqi Foreign Service Institute. 
 
¶4. (U) When questioned about Iraq's relationship with Iran, 
Deputy Minister Abbawi said the two countries had a difficult 
relationship under the Saddam Hussein regime.  There is 
on-going concern about Iran's interference in Iraq through 
the supply of arms and training to militants.  However, he 
stated that Iran is now more interested in building a close 
economic relationship with Iraq and is taking steps to 
control the border.  When asked about the effect of the 2008 
U.S. Presidential election on Iraq, Deputy Minister Abbawi 
said he could not "predict the future," but it is clear that 
the United States remained committed to a successful Iraq. 
He argued that the USG strategy in the Middle East is based 
on building strong ties with governments that support 
democracy, freedom and human rights -- principles shared by 
Iraq.  Stability in Iraq will lead to greater stability in 
the region, which is in the interest of the United States, he 
stated.
