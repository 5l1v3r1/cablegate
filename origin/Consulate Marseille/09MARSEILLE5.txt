SUBJECT: MONACO REACHES OUT ON TAX HAVEN COOPERATION 
 
¶1. (SBU) On March 30, Monaco's Minister of State (Prime 
Minister-equivalent) Jean-Paul Proust telephoned CG.  Proust 
said he wanted to pass the message that the Government of Monaco 
is fully engaged with the EU on "tax haven" matters already, but 
they are also fully disposed to engage on this issue with the 
US.  He wanted to be sure we know that their negotiations with 
the EU are not restrictive and that they are ready to work with 
the U.S. directly. 
 
¶2. (U) In mid-March, the Paris economic daily, Les Echos, 
reported that in the run-up to the G20 summit in London, Proust 
is leading Monaco's effort to ensure that it is not on the 
OECD's tax haven "black list."  Les Echos quoted Proust as 
saying "The principality is ready to increase its cooperation in 
the fight against tax fraud....As soon as there is a suspicion 
of money laundering, of a swindle or any kind of fraud 
whatsoever, no (banking) secrecy exists." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Bio Note:  Proust, 69, had a long career as a French 
civil servant, serving as prefet of the Bouche du Rhone 
department and the Rhone-Alps-Cote d'Azure region, covering the 
area from Marseille to the Italian border, from 1997 to 1999. 
He then became chief of staff to Interior Minister Jean-Pierre 
Chevenement, 1999-2000, and subsequently took over 
responsibility for the greater Paris police department, 
2001-2004.  He became Minister of State in Monaco on June 1, 
¶2005.  Following the 2002 Monegasque constitutional reform, the 
Prince of Monaco no longer has to choose from a list of senior 
French civil servants when filling the post, but he still must 
consult with the French government before doing so.  According 
to the press, Proust is close to French presidential advisor, 
Henri Guaino.  As Prefect of Police of Paris, he had frequent 
dealings with Nicolas Sarkozy who was Interior Minister 
2002-2004.
