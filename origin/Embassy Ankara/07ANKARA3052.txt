URGES UNITY 
 
REF: SECSTATE 17045 
 
¶1.  (U) Turkey has strongly condemned the assassination of 
former Pakistani PM Benazir Bhutto and called for unity in 
the face of terrorism and extremism.  In its December 27 
statement, the MFA greeted the news of Bhutto's death with 
great sorrow and went on to state, "There is no doubt that 
these heinous attacks aim at dragging Pakistan into chaos and 
instability.  We believe the Pakistani people, by acting with 
common sense and reason, will not allow these terrorist acts 
to achieve their goals of destroying the democratization 
process and the basis for reconciliation in the 
country...Despite the rightful feelings of anger and fury, 
all political groups' joining forces, first and foremost the 
Pakistan Peoples Party, against our common enemies of 
terrorism and extremism, is of vital importance and priority 
for the well-being of Pakistan...Turkey will continue to 
support and contribute to the establishment of peace and 
stability in Pakistan through reconciliation." 
 
¶2.  (U) President Gul, who had recently met with Bhutto and 
other opposition leaders during an early December official 
visit to Islamabad, expressed his deep sorrow and urged the 
Pakistani people to act in the best interests of their own 
country.  Both he and PM Erdogan called President Musharraf 
to convey their condolences.  PM Erdogan reportedly also 
called Bhutto's husband. 
 
¶3.  (U) Bhutto's assassination resulted in a rare moment of 
political unity in Ankara.  The Turkish parliament issued a 
joint declaration signed by all political parties stating the 
attack was aimed at the unity and stability of "brotherly" 
Pakistan; Turkish MPs wholeheartedly felt the sorrow of the 
Pakistani people.  Ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) 
representative Nurettin Canikli added Pakistan was a country 
that had always supported Turkey without expecting anything 
in return, and reiterated support for Pakistan's unity. 
 
¶4.  (U) While condemning the assassination and noting the 
risks to Turkey from broader instability in the region, a 
number of leading Turkish columnists quickly drew lessons for 
Turkish democracy from the tragic event.  Murat Yetkin, 
writing in liberal "Radikal," argued that Turkey was the only 
example of a pluralistic democracy in the Muslim world, no 
matter how fragile, thanks to secularism.  Mainstream 
"Milliyet" columnist Fikra Bila opined that the Pakistan 
example proved secularism is vitally important in 
democracies.  Ergun Babahan, in mainstream "Sabah," noted 
developments in Pakistan allow Turks to have a greater 
appreciation for the virtue of democracy.  Mainstream 
"Hurriyet" writer Oktay Eksi drew a lesson for Turkey, 
contrasting the Indian and Pakistani experiences since 
independence, and suggesting that India's embrace of 
democracy has been the key to its economic development and 
political stability.
