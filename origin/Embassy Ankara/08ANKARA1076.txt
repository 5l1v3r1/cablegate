¶1. (SBU) On June 10, Foreign Ministry Deputy Director General 
for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Affairs Ahmet Muhtar 
Gun presented us with a diplomatic note (e-mailed to EUR/SE), 
dated June 9, advising that the Agreement between the 
Government of the Republic of Turkey and the Government of 
the United States of America Regarding Cooperation to 
Facilitate the Provision of Assistance for Preventing the 
Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (EXBS), signed 
in Ankara on 14 June 2005, is now in effect.  In line with 
Article VII of the Agreement, Turkey has completed the 
domestic procedures and formalities required for entry into 
force of this Agreement. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Gun told us that the Foreign Ministry is prepared to 
entertain our proposals for the provision of training and 
equipment under the EXBS program.  He added that he will 
chair a meeting with all relevant Turkish agencies within a 
week to advise on the entry into force of the EXBS Agreement 
and consult on priority areas of cooperation.  Asked if 
Turkey is prepared to consult on the repatriation of highly 
enriched uranium (HEU) fuel from its Cekmece research 
reactor, Gun said he would consult with the Turkish Atomic 
Energy Authority (TAEK) and provide us a response.
