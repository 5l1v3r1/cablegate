¶1. (U) On December 2, 2004, Turk Telekom connected Turkey's 
first toll-free hotline (90-0800-211-6065) for victims of 
human trafficking.  Human Resources Development Foundation 
(HRDF) staff will initially field calls from 8:00 A.M. to 
5:00 P.M., Monday through Friday until Russian- and 
Turkish-language professional and volunteer 
counselor-operators are available to extend the hours of 
operation.  According to Executive Director and Hotline 
Administrator Demet Gural, HRDF is currently interviewing 
applicants. 
 
¶2. (U) HRDF Trafficking officer Tugba Dunder answered Emboff 
phone call to the hotline, verifying that the line is 
connected.  Operators are physically located at HRDF 
Istanbul, a permanent location away from the temporary 
Istanbul shelter facility.  The toll-free number is 
accessible nationwide. 
 
¶3. (U) Where the opportunity exists, Post encourages TIP 
officers in source and surrounding countries to share the TIP 
emergency hotline number (90-0800-211-6065) with local 
anti-TIP NGOs, consulates, and other organizations capable of 
distributing the number to potential trafficking victims 
bound for Turkey.
