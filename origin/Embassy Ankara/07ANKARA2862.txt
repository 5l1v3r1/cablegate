Negroponte: The PKK Threatens Security 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Referans, Zaman, 
Yeni Safak and others report US Deputy Secretary of State John 
Negroponte, in a news conference Wednesday following his meeting 
with Kurdish regional administration PM Nechirvan Barzani, said 
Turkey, the US and Iraq share the same position regarding PKK 
presence in northern Iraq.  "The PKK is threatening security," he 
noted, and a mechanism between Turkey and the US would "resolve the 
problem."  Barzani said that the PKK is "a common problem," 
stressing the Iraqi Kurdish administration's response against the 
PKK.  "More checkpoints have been established in border areas and 
security measures have been enhanced," he said.  The 
economic-political daily Referans says in a news commentary, the US 
is pursuing a plan to block PKK operations, force the organization 
into a ceasefire and liquidate it.  The plan will progress parallel 
to efforts toward peace between Israel and Palestine.  President 
Bush wants to resolve all problems in the region before the end of 
his mandate, according to Referans. 
 
Germany Extradites 2 PKK Members to Turkey, Wants al-Qaeda Suspect 
in Return 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others 
report Germany has extradited two PKK members sought by Turkey.  In 
return, Germany asks for the handover of a German citizen, Atilla 
Selek, who is being held in Turkey for suspected links to al-Qaeda. 
The Turkish Justice Ministry stated that PKK members Mehmet Iltas 
and Mehmet Esref Kizilay - both wanted by Interpol - were 
transferred to prisons in Diyarbakir and Ankara, respectively. 
Iltas is wanted for attacks on a police station and a minivan in 
1991 in which eight people were killed.  Kizilay is charged with 
killing a policeman in 1991.  Atilla Selek was captured in Konya on 
November 7 and is accused of playing a key role in a botched plot to 
attack Ramstein Airbase and Frankfurt Airport in December 2006. 
 
FBI-Turkish Police to Set up anti-Terror Database 
Islamist-oriented Zaman reports on a proposal from the FBI which 
includes the establishment of a "terror intelligence pool" between 
the FBI and the Turkish police.  According to the draft, Turkey and 
the US will set up a joint database containing information about 
terror organizations such as the PKK, Hizbullah and al-Qaeda. 
Turkish police will consult the Turkish General Staff (TGS), the 
National Intelligence Service (MIT) and the Turkish Foreign Ministry 
(MFA) before making a decision about the proposal.  US Ambassador 
Wilson is to meet Interior Minister Besir Atalay next week in order 
to convince Atalay of the heavy blow this partnership could make on 
terror networks.  Turkish security sources have found the common 
database very important in the fight against terror in the two 
countries, says Zaman. 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: 
 
US Ambassador: "We are not interfering with Turkey, we are not 
stalling, we are serious" 
Murat Yetkin wrote in the liberal Radikal (11/30):  "US Ambassador 
Ross Wilson said that the goal of  a recent breakfast meeting with a 
group of politicians and businessmen was to understand the latest 
developments in the southeastern region of Turkey.  His intentions 
were not to interfere with Turkey's domestic affairs.  Responding to 
Radikal's questions, Ambassador Wilson said "our aim regarding the 
PKK issue is to continue joint efforts against the PKK as President 
Bush and PM Erdogan agreed on during their last meeting.  This 
cooperation continues seriously and this cooperation is definitely 
not a stalling tactic. Effective intelligence sharing has already 
started and Turkish officials will decide on how to use this 
intelligence".  When he was asked why DTP deputies were not invited 
to the breakfast, Ambassador Wilson said "the DTP must distance 
itself from the PKK."  The Ambassador added that "meetings always 
take place between diplomats and politicians.  I have such political 
 
ANKARA 00002862  002 OF 003 
 
 
and social meetings almost every day.  Turkish diplomats also attend 
these kinds of meetings at their relevant posts in different 
countries.  Congressman Shays has been in Turkey several times and 
closely follows developments in Turkey.  Because of the latest 
developments, he wanted to go to Diyarbakir and the border region 
this time.  In order to get more information about the situation in 
the region, he wanted to meet with people from different circles. 
He had meetings with diplomats and the military.  That is why we 
invited deputies and businessmen from Diyarbakir and its region for 
breakfast.  This was a very useful meeting. 
 
We are aware that our duty is a 'joint struggle' against the PKK, as 
PM Erdogan and President Bush discussed in Washington.  We are not 
trying to stall. Everyone will see how serious we are on the PKK 
issue, but I cannot give a timeline."  On the cooperation between 
Iraq, US and Turkey, Ambassador Wilson said "the cooperation is 
working well.  We respect FM Babacan's criticism on Iraq, but we 
have noticed certain steps Iraqi officials have taken.  They set 
check points at the border to prevent PKK infiltrating into Turkey 
and some other precautions I can't mention.  The Ambassador added 
that effective intelligence sharing has begun between the US and 
Turkey, however, he could not comment on whether any concrete 
results came out of this.  The Ambassador ended his remarks by 
saying "We do not interfere with Turkey's domestic affairs, we are 
trying to help Turkey in its fight against terrorism, we are not 
wasting Turkey's time, and we are very serious." 
 
Wilson:  Our Target is PKK 
Semih Idiz wrote in the mainstream Milliyet (11/30):  "Ambassador 
Wilson talked about the recent breakfast: "diplomats talk to as many 
host-country citizens as possible in order to get accurate 
information on that country.  And that was exactly what we did on 
Tuesday morning.  I was sorry to see that the breakfast was 
politicized.  We never host events based on ethnic identities." 
Ambassador Wilson said that he had to cancel the lunch he was 
supposed to host yesterday to avoid further speculation.  When asked 
whether or not the Embassy imposed an embargo on the DTP, Ambassador 
Wilson said that "the Embassy always meets with selected politicians 
and legal political parties, including the DTP.  But, whenever we 
meet with them we emphasize that they should distance themselves 
from the PKK."  Ambassador Wilson added that "at the November 5 
meeting we declared the PKK a common enemy of Turkey and the US. 
Our target is the PKK and our goal is to end the PKK violence."
