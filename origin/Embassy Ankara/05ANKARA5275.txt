 ¶1.  Turkey was not able to deliver a definite response to 
our request for commitment to join an international 
partnership on avian and pandemic influenza (REF A). 
Officials at MFA and the Ministries of Health and Agriculture 
said the proposal looked positive, but were unable to give an 
official response.  The Ministry of Health commented that 
they would likely follow the lead of the WHO, as they do for 
general policy and steps on avian influenza.  The GOT 
welcomes exchange of information (REF B). 
 
¶2.  On September 7, Charge delivered Ref A points and paper 
to MFA U/S Ali Tuygan.  On the same day, EconOff delivered 
the points and paper to MFA International Political 
Organizations Department Head Levent Sahinkaya, who promised 
a more substantive response next week, based on coordination 
with the Ministry of Health.  AgCounselor delivered the 
points to officials at the Ministries of Health and 
Agriculture.
