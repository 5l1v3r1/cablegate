National Security Council Convenes 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶1. The second annual meeting of Turkey's Supreme Military Council 
(YAS) convened under PM Tayyip Erdogan on November 30 to assess 
external threats, recent developments in the region, the ongoing 
fight against the PKK terrorist organization, military policies and 
modernization needs of the military.  At this meeting the YAS also 
expelled 37 military personnel, two of them for engaging in 
fundamentalist activities, the remainder for misconduct.  As they 
have during past meetings, PM Erdogan and Defense Minister Vecdi 
Gonul noted their reservations to the expulsions and stated that the 
expulsion decision should be made by a court of law.  This practice 
has become routine with the AKP government.

¶2. Turkish Land Forces Commander GEN Ilker Basbug announced on 
November 15 that Turkey's military relations with France have been 
suspended in response to the French National Assembly approval of a 
bill criminalizing denial of a 1915 Armenian Genocide.  The Turkish 
General Staff issued a written announcement to cancel bilateral 
military activities with France in 2006 and 2007.  As a result, 
joint exercises planned for 2006 and the planned visit of Air Forces 
Commander Gen Faruk Comert to France have been cancelled.  During 
the November 16 kick-off meeting of the International Defense 
Industry Fair (IDEF) to take place in Turkey in May 2007, DefenseMinister Vecdi Gonul announced that France woul not be invited to 
participate (Semi-official Anatolian News Agency (ANA).
