SUBJECT: TURKEY NOT SATISFIED WITH REVISED GLOBAL 
INITIATIVE TO COMBAT NUCLEAR TERRORISM DOCUMENTS 
 
REF: STATE 178121 
 
¶1.  This is an action request.  See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2.  Per reftel request, we presented the revised Statement of 
Principles, Terms of Reference and and Explanatory Notes for 
the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism to MFA Arms 
Control and Disarmament Section Head Serhan Yigit on October 
27, together with our Russian counterpart.  Yigit welcomed 
the revisions as an improvement, but expressed disappointment 
that few of Turkey's suggested changes had been incorporated. 
 According to Yigit, the GOT considers the wording of the 
texts too dictatorial and thinks that some of the partner 
nation requirements would be legally difficult in Turkey and 
would infringe on the country's national sovereignty.  He was 
unwilling to provided specific examples before thoroughly 
reviewing the documents, but said that Turkey would be 
reluctant to sign the documents without further changes and 
would press for additional revisions during the conference. 
 
¶3.  According to Yigit, Turkey will be represented in Rabat 
by a 4-5 person delegation led by MFA Deputy Undersecretary 
for International Security Affairs Rafet Akgunay and 
including Director General for Arms Control and Disarmament 
Bulent Meric, MFA Arms Control and Disarmament Section Head 
Serhan Yigit and MFA Legal Advisor Melike Bosuter.  A Rabat 
Embassy representative may join them.  The delegation plans 
to attend the October 29 reception and participate in the 
subsequent meeting for delegation heads. 
 
¶4.  Action Request: The Turkish delegation would like to make 
a 20 minute presentation about Turkey's WMD and export 
control policy, according to Yigit, but is flexible on the 
date/time of the presentation.  Post requests the 
Department's assistance to respond to Turkey's request and 
identify a speaking slot, if appropriate.
