¶1.  Basat Ozturk, Head of the MFA Maritime Department, 
told Econoff on October 26 that GOT agencies had agreed 
to respond "positively" to the proposed inclusion of 
Turkey in the Container Security Initiative (CSI), and 
asked that Embassy relay this official response to 
Washington agencies.  Ozturk cautioned that the GOT 
needs to sort out internally how to reconcile CSI with 
domestic legislation restricting access to customs areas 
in Turkey.  He noted this will likely require a 
bilateral agreement, and possibly the approval of 
Turkey's Parliament.  Ozturk also said Turkish agencies 
were gathering information requested ref C on customs 
organization and on trade handled by the Port of Izmir, 
and would provide this to us. 
 
¶2.  Ozturk told us that the GOT would welcome a visit by 
U.S. officials to discuss CSI, including a visit to the 
port of Izmir, though he emphasized that the GOT needs 
some time to prepare so that the visit would be of 
maximum use to both sides.  Ref A states that an 
interagency group would like to visit Turkey in November 
or December.  We recommend that DHS propose dates for a 
visit after the end of the Ramazan holiday ending 
November 16.  Edelman
