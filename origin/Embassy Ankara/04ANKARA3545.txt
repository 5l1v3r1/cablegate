The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Turkey presents its compliments to the Embassy of the 
United States of America and with reference to the 
latter's fax message dated 14 June 2004, regarding the 
U.S.' candidature for re-election to the ICAO Council at 
the elections to be held on 28 September-8 October 2004 
in Montreal, has the honor to state the following: 
 
The non-paper enclosed with the above mentioned fax 
message has been duly examined.  Within this context, 
the U.S.' candidature for re-election to the ICAO 
Council will be given due consideration. 
 
However, the situation of Turkey with regard to 
candidacy for the said elections has not been determined 
yet.  Therefore, for the time being, it is not possible 
for the Ministry to give a final reply to the demand for 
support to the US' candidacy for re-election to the ICAO 
Council. 
 
Furthermore, the composition of Turkey's delegation to 
the 35th ICAO Assembly, which has been asked by the 
esteemed Embassy, has not been finalized, too. 
 
In this regard, the composition of Turkish delegation 
and other information with regard to the ICAO Council 
elections as well as our final reply to US' demand for 
re-election to the ICAO Council would be notified to the 
esteemed Embassy, soon. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of

of its highest consideration
