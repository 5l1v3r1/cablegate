SUBJECT: DRAFT BIOTECH REGULATION COULD DISRUPT MORE THAN 1 
BILLION IN U.S. EXPORTS 
 
This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Agricultural Affairs Office learned on October 9 
that the Ministry of Agriculture intends shortly to issue a 
new regulation on agricultural biotechnology.  As written, 
the regulation would have a drastic effect on U.S. 
agricultural exports valued at more than USD 1 billion per 
year.  According to our source, the regulation may be issued 
at any time and will have a six-month implementation period. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We had the opportunity to see a copy of the 
closely-held draft (please protect), which contains various 
requirements that are not only unscientific but also with 
which the United States would be unable to comply.  For 
example: 
 
-- exporting country governments must certify the precise 
transgenic content of every cargo; 
-- Turkish procesors must maintain separate lines for 
transgenic and conventional products; 
-- products must be grown for three years in the country of 
origin before they can be approved for entry into Turkey; 
-- all transgenes are banned in baby food, without reference 
to an assessment of actual risk; 
-- the list of EU-approved transgenic events is not 
grandfathered, as had been the case in some previous draft 
regulations; and, 
-- labeling of transgenic products above a 0.9 percent 
threshold is required, as in the EU. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Currently, Turkey has no regulation in force 
regulating biotechnology.  An unscientific biosafety law was 
drafted in 2007, but Turkish supporters of biotechnology, 
with USDA assistance, were able to block its approval. 
 
¶4. (U) U.S. exports to Turkey of corn, soybeans, and their 
derivatives in 2008 were valued at USD 700 million; through 
August 2009 exports of these products are valued at USD 372 
million.  Exports of U.S. cotton, which might be affected by 
this regulation, were valued at USD 536 million in 2008 and 
USD 335 million through August.  Turkey also imports 
transgenic soybeans and meal from Brazil and Argentina. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  The Agricultural Affairs Office has polled 
affected industry contacts such as the Feedmillers 
Association.  At this point, none intend to make a 
representation to the GOT until the regulation is published. 
Post strongly believes, however, that once the regulation is 
published, it will be much harder for the GOT to back down or 
modify the regulation.  It is critical, therefore, to block 
this regulation before it is published in the Official 
Gazette.  Turkey traditionally does not notify the WTO of 
proposed regulatory changes to permit trading partners to 
comment.  End comment.
