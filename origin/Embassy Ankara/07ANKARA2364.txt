In Today's Papers 
 
Debate over New Constitution Draft 
Mainstream papers report the AK Party is struggling to find an 
appropriate formula for the draft constitution that would ease the 
ban on headscarves in universities.  Government Spokesman Cemil 
Cicek said Monday the new constitution was not prepared for the AKP, 
but for all of Turkey.  Cicek accused the critics of "sabotaging" 
the draft by putting all their emphasis on the controversial issue 
of the headscarf.  Mainstream Milliyet says the headscarf issue was 
the focus of controversy in the new draft constitution.  Mainstream 
Vatan says the constitution commission was inclined to allow attire 
"consistent with sociological realities."  The final decision on the 
issue will be made by Prime Minister Erdogan. 
 
Papers also report the AKP is to consult with the European Union on 
Turkey's draft new constitution prepared by a group of academics and 
the ruling party members before it was made public for debates in 
Turkey.  Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat, the AKP deputy chairman in charge 
of the commission which drafted the constitution, will meet 
ambassadors of EU countries to give details about draft 
constitution.  On Tuesday, a Turkish Foreign Ministry (MFA) 
delegation will hold a meeting with EU Troika representatives in 
Lisbon, detailing them about the draft.  Opposition leader Deniz 
Baykal lashed out at the government for informing EU ambassadors in 
Ankara on the draft before consulting the opposition. 
 
Erdogan Due to Visit the US 
All papers report Prime Minister Erdogan will go to the US on 
Thursday to participate in UN General Assembly (UNGA) meetings. 
Before arriving in New York, Erdogan will visit his newly born 
grandson in Washington.  On September 24-25 Erdogan will participate 
in UNGA talks in New York.  The PM might hold a brief meeting with 
President Bush on the sidelines of the summit.  Erdogan will also 
come together with 25 leaders including French President Sarkozy, 
Pakistani President Musharraf, German Chancellor Merkel, and British 
Prime Minister Brown.  On September 26 Erdogan will open the New 
York Stock Exchange, and deliver a speech at the Turkish-American 
Association (TAA) later on the same day.  On September 28 he will 
join a meeting at Clinton Foundation and will meet the Democrat 
presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton who will host a Ramadan "Iftar" 
dinner in his honor.  Erdogan will return to Turkey on September 29. 
Erdogan is to pay a second visit to the US to meet with President 
Bush later in the year, according to papers. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Erdogan's US Visit 
Hakan Aygun comments in the conservative daily Bugun: "Prime 
Minister Erdogan is leaving soon for the United Nations General 
Assembly meetings.  However the real purpose of this trip is to have 
a chat with President Bush.  In other words, it is hoped that his 
stand up with President Bush will set the ground for a future 
tte-`-tte at the White House. Turkey's plan is to revive the 
strategic partnership which really wound down after March 1, 2003. 
The ruling AKP seems determined to turn it back up like the old 
days, and PM Erdogan wants to hear President Bush utter the words 
"Turkish-American strategic partnership."  Considering the timing of 
this effort which comes right before the probable Iran operation, it 
seems we are just heading toward more trouble." 
 
DTP Concerned Investigations May Lead to Party Closure 
All papers report Turkey's main Kurdish party DTP deputy chairman 
Selma Irmak has expressed concern over the investigations initiated 
against her party, saying other parties had been disbanded as a 
result of similar investigations in the past.  "We call for an end 
to the legal and societal pressures placed on our party, and for 
dialogue.  The presence of the DTP in the parliament is a historic 
opportunity for Turkey," Irmak said. 
 
Turkey's top state prosecutor has recently launched a probe into the 
DTP over its leader Ahmet Turk's allegation that the Turkish 
 
ANKARA 00002364  002 OF 003 
 
 
military used chemical weapons against PKK fighters in the mainly 
Kurdish southeast.  The Turkish General Staff (TGS) has denied the 
accusation.  The case opened by the chief prosecutor of Turkey's 
Appeals Court raises the possibility that DTP could eventually 
suffer the same fate as other pro-Kurdish parties and be shut down, 
papers comment. 
 
President Gul to Northern Cyprus 
Hurriyet, Vatan, Radikal and others report that on his first visit 
abroad as President, Abdullah Gul departs for the Turkish Republic 
of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) today.  His wife Hayrunnisa Gul, who has 
kept a low profile so far, will accompany Gul on the visit. This 
will be the first time that First Lady will be part of the 
Presidential protocol. 
 
FM Babacan: Reform Process will Continue 
Zaman, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal and others:  FM and Chief EU 
negotiator Ali Babacan met with the high level bureaucrats of all 
public institutions at the EU Secretariat General and said that the 
EU reform process will continue and a new program will be prepared 
for the country's EU accession process.  Babacan added that for EU 
negotiations new detailed programs covering three-month periods will 
be prepared and that the EU target will let Turkey reach universal 
standards in issues like democracy, fundamental rights and freedoms, 
and supremacy of law. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Greek Elections 
Sami Kohen writes in the mainstream daily Milliyet: "Greek PM 
Karamanlis won the election with a slight margin and will be able to 
rule another four years.  The main question is this: will he be able 
to make domestic reforms as promised and will he be powerful enough 
to take necessary actions internationally?    He and his party will 
certainly face a more challenging period ahead since the ruling 
party is now going to be challenged by three opposition parties, 
ranging from far right to left.  One of the peculiar points for 
Turkey was the fact that unlike previous election campaigns, neither 
the Karamanlis nor Papandreou parties used the Cyprus issue as a 
propaganda tool.  The campaign primarily focused on economic issues 
and reforms.  Let's hope that Karamanlis shows leadership and takes 
the necessary steps to improve bilateral ties with Turkey.  The 
never-realized trip by Karamanlis to Turkey, hopefully, can happen 
this time."
