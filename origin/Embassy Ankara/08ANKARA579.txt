In Today's Papers 
 
Turkish NGOs Call on Political Parties to Compromise 
All papers report that on Wednesday, Turkey's leading 
non-governmental organizations issued a joint statement warning 
against polarization in the country, emphasizing that everyone had 
"to take a step back from their current positions" to contribute to 
the atmosphere of compromise.  The Presidents of the Turkish Union 
of Chambers (TOBB), the Confederation of Public Workers' Unions 
(Kamu-Sen), the Confederation of Labor Unions (Turk-Is), the 
Confederation of Tradesmen's Unions (TESK), the Confederation of 
Employers' Unions (TISK), the Agricultural Chambers' Union (TZOB,) 
and the Workers Rights Union (Hak-Is) released a statement in 
Istanbul calling for "common sense."  TOBB Chairman Rifat 
Hisarciklioglu announced, "These days, Turkey is going through a 
difficult test of democracy and law.  Turkey should quickly shift 
its focus on economic and social problems, particularly 
unemployment.  Turkey is a democratic, secular and social state 
based on the constitutional rule of law.  We must protect these 
principles; they cannot be a matter of politics which can be 
discussed freely."  The statement also said, "Closing political 
parties restricts the freedoms of institutions and individuals; this 
harms the democratic process instead of strengthening the democratic 
process." 
 
Prime Minister Erdogan, speaking to reporters in Albania yesterday, 
said he agrees with the NGOs' message, "We are ready to take the 
lead toward common sense.  I have never been opposed to talking to 
opposition leaders."  Opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal said he has 
been calling for meetings with the AKP since 2002, but that Erdogan 
has ignored him.  "We cannot back the AKP's changes to the 
constitution because the changes are being proposed during 
proceedings in a court case; our support would mean the CHP is 
giving a green light to the AKP's violation of secularism," said 
Baykal.  Opposition far right MHP Deputy Group Chairman Oktay Vural 
said the NGOs' call should be directed to the PM and AKP, who Vural 
calls, "the architects of the polarization and tension in the 
country." 
 
Liberal Radikal comments "the AKP is ready to go to a referendum to 
stop the lawsuit for closure," but "there are fears that a 
referendum could trigger a military coup."  The CHP wants the AKP to 
ease concerns over the attempts to undermine secularism.  Radikal 
writes, "The annulment of headscarf reforms is one step that could 
ease the concerns of the CHP." 
 
 
President Gul Will Meet Opposition Leaders Thursday 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Taraf, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, Yeni 
Safak and others report President Abdullah Gul invited CHP leader 
Deniz Baykal and MHP leader Devlet Bahceli to talks at the 
presidential palace on Thursday.  Papers report political circles in 
Ankara, however, speculate the president wants to reduce the 
tensions surrounding the constitutional changes and the Ergenekon 
investigation.  Gul will meet with the DSP tomorrow; he will meet 
with far right BBP and leftist ODP in the coming days.  Hurriyet, 
Sabah, and Radikal report sources close to the president said Gul 
did not invite the pro-Kurdish DTP because they met recently. 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet claims Gul will meet with the DTP 
after today's talks with the CHP and the MHP. 
 
TGS Chief General Buyukanit in Northern Cyprus 
Hurriyet, Sabah, Milliyet, Cumhuriyet, Radikal, Zaman, Yeni Safak 
and others:  All papers report that General Buyukanit paid his first 
visit as Chief of General Staff to the Turkish Republic of Cyprus 
(TRNC).  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports General Buyukanit 
told TRNC President Mehmet Ali Talat, "Turkish troops will remain on 
the island until a lasting and fair solution to the Cyprus problem 
is found."  Yesterday's Sabah reported that Greek-Cypriot leader 
Dimitris Christophias told the Greek Cypriot press, "I have no 
 
ANKARA 00000579  002 OF 003 
 
 
expectations regarding Buyukanit's visit.  As a matter of fact, I am 
sorry to hear that he is coming to the island." 
 
Meanwhile, mainstream Sabah reports that mine sweeping at the 
Lokmaci Gate began yesterday morning.  After the mines are cleared, 
all the buildings in the area will be renovated. 
 
 
Education Ministry Recommended Pirated School Books 
Liberal Radikal reports that the Book Translators' Association 
(CEVBIR) and the Union of Publishers (YAYBIR) checked classical 
books from their "100 Basic Books" list, which were recommended by 
the National Education Ministry, and realized most of the 
translations were pirated from previous translations.  Moreover, 
they were disturbed to find that many of the classics' chapters were 
shortened for no reason.  Radikal notes that CEVBIR and YAYBIR will 
send their reports to the Education Ministry in order to ban the 
sale of pirated books. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Iraq 
 
"Iraq's Other War" 
Sami Kohen wrote in mainstream Milliyet (3/27): "It first started in 
Basra and now has spread to other Iraqi cities.  This is a different 
type of war; this war is not between Iraqis and Americans or Shiites 
and Sunnis.  Basra is now under the control of Shiite militias loyal 
to Muqtada al-Sadr.  However, there are other Shiite rival groups 
involved, including gangs accused of corruption and other illegal 
activities.  Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has initiated an 
operation to clean out all kinds of illegal gangs from Basra. 
Maliki issued a 72-hour deadline for these groups to lay down their 
arms, but al-Sadr has defied this deadline and has called for riots. 
 Unless a ceasefire is established, Iraq is on the verge of a 
serious civil war.  This event is a test for the Iraqi central 
government's authority.   If the Maliki government fails this test, 
the consequences will damage the central authority's legitimacy and 
endanger Iraq's unity and integrity." 
 
"What Is Happening in Iraq?" 
Sedat Sertoglu wrote in mainstream Aksam (3/27): "In a move that 
surprises no one, the Iraqi army has launched an operation against 
Moktada al-Sadr's Basra Mehdi Army.  There are constant reports 
about heavy clashes and a serious number of casualties.  Prime 
Minister Maliki's motive in his decision to go ahead with the 
military operation against the Shiite groups is oil.  Because these 
Shiite groups were fighting each other for control of oil resources, 
the Iraqi PM wanted the central authority to take control.  There is 
a common saying in Iraq, "Whoever controls Basra controls oil." 
Even though al-Sadr's militias were asked to lay down their arms 
within 72 hours, it does not seem likely to happen.  By arming both 
Shiite groups, Iran is the key actor in this game.  If al-Sadr does 
not respect the ceasefire, then all of Iraq will likely turn to a 
bloodbath.  In that case, the U.S. will lose its 'all is well in 
Iraq' argument and thus Iran will be able to kill many birds with 
one stone."
