SUBJECT: TURKEY EXPORTS 180 MW OF ELECTRICITY TO NORTHERN 
IRAQ 
 
 
Sensitive But Unclassified. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On a January 13 visit to the Karadeniz power plant 
near Silopi, southeast Turkey, which began providing 
electricity to northern Iraq in September 2003, Ankara and 
Adana officers learned that the plant is currently exporting 
about 180 MW across the border.  The transmission line 
connecting the plant to the electricity grid around Dohuk has 
a capacity of between 200 and 225 MW, according to the plant 
manager. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Karadeniz recently added 100 MW of generating 
capacity at the plant -- bringing total capacity to 175 MW. 
However, the plant generates only about 85 MW on average, 
because the plant does not receive bartered fuel oil from 
Iraq (as originally planned) and must purchase more expensive 
fuel oil in Turkey.  The rest of the power for Iraq is 
purchased by Karadeniz from the Turkish hydroelectric plant 
at the Keban dam (25 MW) and from the the Turkish electricity 
grid (about 70 MW). 
 
Baghdad Minimize Considered.
