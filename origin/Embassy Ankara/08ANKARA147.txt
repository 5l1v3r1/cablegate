REF: ANKARA 121 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  The Turkish Ministry of Agriculture appears to be following 
appropriate procedures in response to the AI outbreak in Zonguldak 
province. 
 
¶2. On January 22, the Ministry of Agriculture's General Directorate 
of Protection and Control submitted a report to the World 
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) regarding the outbreak.  The 
report states that there were 13 bird deaths in a backyard poultry 
flock of 300. It is believed that the origin of the H5N1 virus 
infection came through contact with wild birds.  The measures that 
are being taken by the Ministry of Agriculture are: stamping out 
(culling), quarantine, movement control inside the country, zoning, 
disinfection of infected premises, and dipping and spraying. 
¶3. According to news reports, Turkish authorities culled nearly 600 
poultry in villages near the Black Sea coast on January 23.    The 
Ministry told the press that "a total of 570 chickens, 14 ducks and 
two geese had been culled and buried." 
¶4. At the moment, the Ministry has not requested any assistance from 
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). 
According to the FAO Ankara office, their local representative is 
impressed with Turkey's response to this outbreak and is planning to 
monitor wild birds in the region. 
¶5. As of January 23, Azerbaijan and Iraq have banned poultry and 
poultry product imports from Turkey as a result of the AI outbreak. 
According to our trade contacts, the ban is currently not affecting 
re-exports of U.S. poultry and products out of the Mersin Free Trade 
Zone.
