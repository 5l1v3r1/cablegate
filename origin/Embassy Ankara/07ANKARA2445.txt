SUBJECT: Update on PKK Violence (September 24-30, 2007) 
 
REF: ANKARA 2413 and previous 
 
U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) During the September 24-30, 2007 reporting period, 11 GOT 
security officials were killed, including seven village guards shot 
by PKK terrorists while riding on a minibus and another three in IED 
explosions.  Fifteen security officials were injured, including 10 
in explosions. 
 
¶3. (U) In the same period, 11 PKK terrorists were killed in clashes, 
while three PKKers were captured and another five surrendered. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported 12 clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists in Turkey's southeastern region during the 
reporting period.  Security forces discovered at least 35 PKK 
shelters/caves/caches and seized booby-trapped land mines; other 
explosives, including A-4 and TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; 
hand grenades; pistols; night vision binoculars; TV sets; satellite 
antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. (U) During the reporting period security forces detected 21 
explosive devices in the region, most of which were detonated in a 
controlled environment before they exploded as planned by the PKK. 
 
¶6. (U) On September 29, PKK terrorists opened fire on a minibus 
carrying village guards and civilians who were returning from a 
water pipeline construction project to their homes in Besagac, 
Beytussebap District in Sirnak Province.  Seven village guards and 
five civilians died and one village guard and one civilian were 
injured during the incident. 
 
On September 29, a young boy collecting wood, stepped on a PKK mine 
near Balaban, Dicle District, Diyarbakir Province.  He was killed. 
 
On September 28, a PKK mine went off in the mountainous region of 
Adakli District, Bingol Province, killing three grazing animals. 
 
On September 25, a PKK mine went off in the mountainous region of 
Pulumur District, Tunceli Province, killing three grazing animals. 
 
On September 24, a privately-owned tractor struck a mine on the road 
between Mutki and Kapakli in Bitlis Province and was damaged.
