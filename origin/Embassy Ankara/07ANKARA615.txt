¶1. (SBU) We have provided reftel's non-paper to several 
different offices at the Turkish MFA, particularly those 
involved in the recent Policy Planning Talks: the Americas 
desk, 
their Policy Planning shop and the Office of Multilateral 
Economic Affairs.  S/P Krasner raised the PDG in his February 
22 
meetings here, with excellent resonance, and we understand he 
has 
also raised the issue with the Turkish Embassy in Washington. 
 
¶2. (SBU) With the Office of Multilateral Economic Affairs, 
which has responsibility for OECD issues, we urged Turkish 
support, including financial, for the PDG and in particular 
asked for their support at the March 20 Council Meeting. 
Though our Turkish counterpart said they do not yet have a 
definite position, she said Turkey would give positive 
consideration to our proposal.
