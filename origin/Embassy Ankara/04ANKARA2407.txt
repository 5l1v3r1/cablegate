SUBJECT: ESTABLISHING A US MISSION IN BAGHDAD: TURKEY 
BRIEFED 
 
 
REF: STATE 89241 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) On April 26, PolMilOff briefed Turkish MFA Iraq 
Department Head Serra Erarslan on plans for establishing a US 
Mission in Baghdad.  Erarslan's only comment was to ask 
whether the US Mission would retain control over elements of 
Iraqi sovereignty, and referred to recent public statements 
by senior US officials on limited Iraqi sovereignty after 
June 30.  We explained that post June 30, the interim Iraqi 
Government would assume full governing (although not 
legislative or security) authority and that we did not expect 
the US Mission as such to exercise sovereign authority in 
Iraq. 
 
 
¶2. (U) Erarslan said that the Turkish Mission in Baghdad 
would retain its current staffing of an Ambassador plus four 
other diplomats (one counselor, one first secretary and two 
third secretaries) plus administrative staff. 
 
 
¶3. (U) Baghdad minimize considered.
