Following discussions between NP A/S Wolf and Ambassador 
Edelman, and with the abolition of the ONW POLAD position in 
July 2004, Embassy Ankara is able to support NP's request to 
establish an EXBS Program Advisor position.  The advisor will 
be integrated into the political-military affairs section, 
and assume responsibility for other nonproliferation issues 
in addition to their EXBS duties.  Due to severe space 
limitations, Embassy Ankara will not be able to support the 
establishment of a local contract national (LCN) position to 
provide administrative support to the EXBS advisor.  However, 
the EXBS advisor will be able to contract for administrative 
and logistical assistance on the local economy as needs arise.
