Begin Informal Embassy Translation/Text: 
 
We are pleased that the UNSC unanimously adopted resolution 
1701 yesterday as a result of international efforts to stop 
the clashes that have been continuing in Lebanon for a month 
and to restore peace in the region. 
 
The resolution urges the sides to stop clashes totally, and 
support a permanent ceasefire and long-term solution on the 
basis of aforementioned principles and elements.  The 
resolution also foresees the withdrawal of Israeli forces 
from the region and an enlargement of UNIFIL's mission 
statement and scope of its activities, including an increase 
of the number of its personnel of up to 15,000 troops and a 
parallel deployment of UNIFIL together with Lebanese forces 
in southern Lebanon following the ending of clashes. 
 
Moreover, the resolution refers to the need to establish a 
lasting, fair and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, 
and, to this end, it is important to implement related UN 
resolutions. 
 
Turkey, from the beginning of the crisis, at bilateral and 
multilateral fora, has exerted great efforts to end the 
negative trend in the region by supporting an end to clashes 
as soon as possible and the declaration of a cease-fire, as 
well as stressing the need to negotiate the political 
framework of a lasting peace. 
 
The resolution is a noteworthy step in terms of stopping the 
clashes before the crisis in Lebanon gains more crucial 
dimensions and paving the way in finding a lasting solution 
to the dispute.  Moreover, the resolution will enable the 
creation of necessary conditions to provide urgent and 
comprehensive humanitarian assistance to Lebanon. 
 
Within this framework, it is important that the parties -- 
without wasting any time -- act in compliance with the words 
and spirit of the UNSC resolution number 1701 that was 
adopted unanimously. 
 
We expect the sides to end clashes immediately to enable 
implementation of the resolution.
