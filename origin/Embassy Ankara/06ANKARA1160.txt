In Today's Papers 
 
Debates over Accusations against General Buyukanit 
All papers:  Prime Minister Erdogan accused the main 
opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal and the press of trying 
to cause a rift between the government and military by 
confusing people about the charges directed by a prosecutor 
against Land Forces Commander General Yasar Buyukanit. 
Erdogan told his party parliamentary group meeting yesterday 
that confrontation between the judiciary and military will 
not benefit Turkey.  General Hilmi Ozkok, the chief of the 
Turkish General Staff (TGS) told President Sezer at a 
meeting on Tuesday that the accusations against Buyukanit 
were designed to damage the military.  Ozkok also complained 
that the military's maneuvering area has been restricted by 
the anti-terror laws passed by the parliament.  Vatan claims 
that some commanders in the military are concerned that anti- 
TGS political elements regarding the military as an obstacle 
against their aspirations have been encouraged by the "soft" 
attitude of General Ozkok.  Government Spokesman Cicek 
denied any involvement by the government in the judicial 
proceeding against Buyukanit, adding that  if it contained 
deficiencies, the investigation file could be rejected by 
the court. 
 
MFA: Turkey Wants Enhanced Cooperation in Black Sea 
Hurriyet, Sabah, Cumhuriyet, Radikal, Yeni Safak:  "Turkey 
believes that regional cooperation will contribute to peace 
and stability in the Black Sea, and has pioneered the 
initiatives to establish the Black Sea Economic Cooperation 
(BSEC)," Turkish Foreign Ministry (MFA) Spokesman Namik Tan 
said on Tuesday with regard to press reports that a NATO 
force will be set up in the Black Sea.  "We also proposed 
the formation of BLACKSEAFOR (Black Sea Naval Cooperation 
Task Force) by littoral states to assure the security in the 
Black Sea.  Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria, the three 
countries that have joined this force, are NATO members.  We 
have also launched Operation Black Sea Harmony, inviting all 
littoral states.  We are sharing the intelligence we collect 
from this operation with our allies," Tan stressed.  Yeni 
Safak claims that Turkey and Russia block US aspirations to 
deploy military in the Black Sea and the Caucasus.  The 
paper comments that the US intends to control the Blue 
Stream natural gas pipeline with a prospective annexation of 
an oil pipeline, warning that Ankara's sovereignty over the 
Straits will be damaged. 
 
Iran-West Standoff Over Tehran's Nuclear Program 
Sabah, Milliyet, Vatan, Cumhuriyet, Radikal, Zaman, Yeni 
Safak:  Tehran rejected a plan by the international 
community under which Iran would suspend industrial-scale 
uranium enrichment for two years.  After talks with the US, 
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia had made 
no a "compromise" proposal that would allow Iran to enrich 
uranium, even in small quantities.  Iran views enriching 
work as involving up to 3,000 centrifuges that enrich 
uranium, an industrial-level figure according to experts. 
The United States believe that Iran has already "crossed the 
international red line."  Turkish papers quote Iranian 
officials as saying, "Whenever we agree, the US breaks it 
up."  Meanwhile, several Turkish dailies cite a Washington 
Post article which said Turkey is reviving its quest for 
nuclear power, pressed both by serious energy shortfalls and 
by "strident nuclear ambitions in neighboring Iran," 
underlining that any Turkish move toward a nuclear weapons 
program would mark a dramatic departure from long-standing 
foreign policy and military doctrine seen in a slogan of 
Ataturk, "Peace at home, peace in the world."

Columnist Sami Kohen warned that the Iran issue is not only 
about its nuclear enrichment program.  In his column in the 
mainstream Milliyet he drew attention to the dangers of the 
Iranian regime: "The current behavior of the Iranian 
administration and its policy goals cause worry.  Ankara is 
disturbed by Ahmedinejad's tension building policy, and 
believes that the Middle East needs steps toward calm and 
compromise more than ever before.  There is also an Iraq 
angle to the worry about Iran.  Tehran is apparently very 
pleased with the rise of Shiite power in Iraq.  If a Shiite 
state is created in the south of Iraq, the mullahs of Iran 
will undoubtedly be very active." 
 
Ruling out the possibility of a military action, nationalist 
Ortadogu columnist Kamuran Ozbir observed: "From 
Washington's point of view, it seems unlikely for Bush to 
take military action against Iran while the Iraqi swamp 
deepens.  If common sense and rationalism prevail in the 
world, the Iran tension will be resolved eventually." 
 
Gul Due in US 
Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others:  Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul 
is to meet UN Secretary General Annan in New York and 
Secretary Rice in Washington on March 26-29 at the annual 
 
SIPDIS 
meeting of the American-Turkish Council (ATC).  Gul will 
address the ATC on Turkey-US ties, and discuss Cyprus and 
other regional issues with Annan and Rice. 
 
OSCE: Conditions Improve in Guantanamo 
Hurriyet, Cumhuriyet:  Inmates at Guantanamo Bay prison are 
treated better than in Belgian jails, a report by the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) 
said after a visit to the controversial detention center. 
OSCE member Belgian Senator Anne-Marie Lizin said conditions 
in Guantanamo have recently improved, warning that the 
prison should not be closed immediately because countries 
like Yemen and Saudi Arabia would not immediately allow the 
return of their nationals kept there. 
 
Turkey Approves Armenia's Membership in Eurocontrol 
Cumhriyet reports that Turkey, under EU pressure toimprove 
ties with neighboring countries, approved Armenia's request 
for membership in Eurocontrol, the European Organization for 
the Safety of Air Navigation.  Turkey began to carry out win- 
win policies in dealings with Armenia, says the paper. 
 
Turkish Media Watchdog Allows Broadcasts in Kurdish 
Milliyet, Sabah, Cumhuriyet, Radikal, Zaman:  Turkish Radio 
and Television High Board (RTUK) authorized the Diyarbakir- 
based Gun TV and Soz TV, and Sanlyurfa-based Medya FM radio 
to commence broadcasts in Kurdish.  Local TV channels will 
be allowed to air four hours and radio stations five hours 
of programs weekly. 
 
Turkish Women Uneducated, Subject to Violence 
Milliyet says on the occasion of World Women's Day that 34 
percent of Turkish families suffer domestic violence in 
which 46 percent of children are beaten.  Eighty percent of 
women victims believe they are helpless in blocking domestic 
violence.  Forty-five percent of males believe they have the 
right to beat women in cases of disobedience.  39.6 percent 
of women aged 15-24 are unemployed, and one out of four 
women is illiterate.  Only 3.9 percent of women are 
university graduates and women make 40 percent less than men 
in professional life.
