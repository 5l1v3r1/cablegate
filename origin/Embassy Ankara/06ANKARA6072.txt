SUBJECT: ENCOURAGING TURKISH ATTENDANCE AT THE NOVEMBER 7-8 
BIOMETRICS CONFERENCE IN JORDAN 
 
REF: SECSTATE 175052 
 
On October 20, poloff delivered reftel points to both the 
Turkish National Police's Intelligence Department (Acting) 
Head and to the MFA's International Terror, Organized Crime, 
and Drug Trafficking Department Head.  Our meeting was the 
first word either office had of the conference.  TNP's 
Intelligence Department was concerned that as a result of the 
emphasis on fingerprinting, the invitation would be directed 
to the criminal department instead, but readily agreed that 
the counterterrorism angle was of interest to them.  The MFA 
expressed interest and agreed to check into the conference 
within the ministry.
