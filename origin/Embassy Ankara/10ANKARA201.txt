¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  The February 4 one-day nationwide work stoppage by 
major labor confederations made a significant media splash but 
seemed to create only minor disruptions across Turkey.  Two 
confederations did not, in the end, participate in the work 
stoppage, although they had initially committed to join.  The 
remaining confederations still pronounced the action a success. 
There were no major security incidents.  The GOT continued to argue 
that the TEKEL workers' situation is not a matter of their rights 
being denied.  Commentators are focusing more on the nature of the 
workers' 4C status, and the Prime Minister's tone when he addresses 
the issue.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Labor confederations representing private and public sector 
workers organized a one-day work stoppage on Thursday, February 4 
across the country in support of the former TEKEL workers (REFTEL). 
The press reported that tens of thousands of workers participated in 
the act, but actual numbers are difficult to estimate.  The Turk-Is, 
DISK, Kamu-Sen and KESK confederations actively participated.  The 
Hak-Is and Memur-Sen confederations -- although they initially had 
announced their support -- did not join the strike.  The Hava-Is 
Union for Civil Aviation workers decided to heed the warning of the 
THY administration that there would be consequences to stopping 
work, and continued working. 
 
¶3. (U) In other sectors, the municipal busses did not operate in 
Izmir, and the metro stopped temporarily in Ankara.  Tens of 
thousands of people gathered at Ankara's Kizilay square.  Anatolia 
News Agency workers stopped work for one hour, as a symbolic 
gesture.  Members of the National Movement Party (CHP) did not work. 
 In Zonguldak, 7,000 coal mine workers stopped working and in 
Kutahya the boron mine workers also stopped work.  Doctors across 
the country -- except in emergency units -- did not work, and in 
Istanbul members of all of the confederations gathered at Sarachane 
square.  NGOs and representatives of opposition parties as well as 
artists and intellectuals joined them to display solidarity.  In 
Denizli, workers clashed with police when they wanted to march to 
the AKP headquarters. 
 
¶4. (U) Confederations pronounced themselves pleased with the impact 
of the stoppage.  Turk-Is Labor Confederation President Mustafa 
Kumlu said that the work stoppage was an important warning to the 
GOT.  He noted that the former TEKEL workers "woke up the sleeping 
giant" and that the Turkish people now support the victimized 
workers.  He termed the act as a success because people stopped 
working everywhere, despite the threats by the governors, 
bureaucrats and employers. 
 
¶5. (U) Government officials sent out balanced messages.  While Prime 
Minister Ergodan preserved his stance that there would be no change 
for the workers' conditions, the Labor Minister tried to portray the 
work stoppage as a "mature" act, but one which was illegal.  PM 
Erdogan noted that 450 workers had applied for 4C status so far.  In 
response to a question, Erdogan said the government is not 
considering interfering in the former TEKEL workers' protest until 
the end of the month, but after that it would have to intervene 
because the workers would be performing an "occupation."  Finance 
Minister Mehmet Simsek said that TEKEL workers' continuing their 
protests despite the improvements the GOT had made to their 4C could 
not be viewed as a "struggle to seek rights."  The Labor and Social 
Security Minister Omer Dincer emphasized that no services were 
halted despite the act of the workers.  He reiterated that the 
government had presented an important opportunity to the workers, 
and suggested the conflict would get bigger. 
 
¶6. (U) In papers today columnists discussed the issue of 4C status 
and argued that with coming privatizations, as many as 25,000 
workers will be assigned 4C status.  Fikret Bila, a commentator from 
"Milliyet" newspaper, argued that while implementing privatization, 
the State should not focus just on making money but should consider 
the social impact.  He said that privatization decisions should be 
made while weighing the "social benefit-social cost" calculation. 
Rusen Cakir, of "Vatan" newspaper, focused more on PM Erdogan's 
comments, criticizing him for being overly blunt when referring to 
the TEKEL workers.  Cakir said that Erdogan should stop complaining 
about the workers, and instead patiently continue the negotiations 
until he finds a solution.

¶7. (SBU) COMMENT: The tension between the workers and the GOT seems 
to be rising.  The government indicates it will proceed with 
privatizations and will use 4C status for all laid off workers.  The 
protest of TEKEL workers has now attained a symbolic status, which 
can be used for political purposes.  A semblance of inaction, as 
well as any excessive intervention against the former TEKEL workers 
-- some 200 of whom have begun an "indefinite" hunger strike today 
-- is likely to intensify the friction.
