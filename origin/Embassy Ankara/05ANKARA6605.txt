¶1.  Summary.  The Government of Turkey (GOT) is still 
cautious about lifting the quarantine restrictions in the AI 
affected zone until more testing is done. The dead poultry 
in Inegol tested negative for AI. Although there continues 
to be no new confirmed outbreaks of AI in Turkey, there are 
reports of dead fowl in two additional Turkish regions. Lab 
results are expected at the end of the week.  End summary.

The Quarantine Restrictions May Soon Be lifted 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2.  (U)The GOT decided to take more precautions before 
lifting the quarantine restrictions.  The lab results showed 
that there was no presence of AI in the blood samples taken 
from poultry in the 7 kilometer observation area outside of 
the quarantine zone.  Although the results were negative, 
the GOT is still cautious and is not lifting the quarantine 
just yet.  They are considering doing more testing in that 
region before it removes the quarantine restrictions.  GOT 
continues to monitor for other AI occurrences in the 
country.

Lab test results on samples from Inegol poultry deaths 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶3. (U) Last week, the Ministry of Agriculture sent samples 
of the chickens that died in Inegol, Bursa, to the lab to 
test for Avian Influenza and for Newcastle's Disease. 
Results received this week show that the samples tested 
negative for AI.  Lab tests were inconclusive for 
Newcastle's Disease.  The lab is re-testing for Newcastle 
Disease and results are expected later this week.

More Suspicious Bird Deaths 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Reports indicate that there were two new cases of 
bird deaths over the weekend in two different areas of 
Turkey.  Although, the cause of death is not expected to be 
AI, the GOT is taking extra precautionary measures.  Samples 
from birds in both occurrences have been sent to the 
government lab in Izmir and are being tested for AI. 
Results should be known by the end of this week. 
 
     a. (U) Sources from the Ministry of Agriculture 
indicate that in Cankiri, a province north of Ankara, 
several birds died suddenly and many more are sick.  Samples 
from both the dead and sick birds have been sent to the 
Izmir lab for testing. 
 
     b. (U) The Anatolian Press reports that at least four 
birds have died in Furunlu, in the province of Izmir.  The 
mayor of Furunlu said that chicken deaths are frequent at 
this time of year because of seasonal climate changes or 
other ailments so he does not expect AI to be the cause of 
death.  Nevertheless, samples from a dead chicken and a 
cockerel were sent to the lab in Izmir to be tested for AI.
