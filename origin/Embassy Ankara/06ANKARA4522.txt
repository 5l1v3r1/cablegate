SUBJECT: TURKEY SUPPORTS GLOBAL INITIATIVE BUT UNABLE TO 
HOST INITIAL MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 124967 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Turkey is a strong supporter of the 
US/Russia Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.  The 
GOT issued a public statement endorsing the initiative and 
subsequently indicated to us their interest in playing an 
active role.  In a preliminary response to reftel request to 
host the initial meeting, GOT officials indicated their 
willingness to serve as host but believe the October 5-6 time 
frame will not be feasible.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Turkey pledged its full support for the US/Russia 
initiative immediately following the July 15 announcement on 
the initiative.  In a July 17 MFA Announcement, the GOT 
welcomed the importance of the initiative and the need for 
international cooperation.  It noted Turkey's contributions 
to international efforts to combat international terrorism, 
including signing the UN Convention on Nuclear Terrorism and 
pledged its participation in the first meeting of the 
initiative. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Russians have had difficulty in scheduling a 
joint meeting with U/S Tuygan.  To ensure a timely delivery 
of the request, we made an initial inquiry.  The MFA 
underscored its complete support for the initiative and 
welcomed the opportunity to host the initial meeting.  Given 
the MTCR Plenary in September and the November NATO Summit, 
however, they believe the October time frame is unworkable 
but offered to host a subsequent meeting. 
 
¶4. (SBU) We believe the GOT is interested and was pleased to 
be asked to host the initial meeting.  If it is possible to 
move back the initial meeting by several months, the Turks 
might be in a better position to host.  If not, we recommend 
that Turkey be invited to host the next meeting.
