In Today's Papers 
 
Kurdish Mayors Investigated for Praising the PKK 
All papers report the Interior Ministry has assigned two inspectors 
to probe allegations that Kurdish DTP mayors Osman Baydemir of 
Diyarbakir and Ahmet Ertak of Sirnak were engaging in PKK 
propaganda.  In a recent interview with the Brussels-based Roj TV, 
Baydemir reportedly referred to the PKK as "the armed Kurdish 
opposition," whereas Ertak told French Channel 24 television station 
"the PKK supports Kurdish people, and we support the PKK." 
 
PKK Attacks Cargo Train 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Yeni Safak and 
others report a freight train going from Sivas to Erzurum was 
attacked by PKK terrorists using remote control bombs, which 
derailed seven cars.  No injuries were reported.  Papers speculate 
the actual target of the bomb was the Erzurum Express train, which 
was due to pass through the same spot two hours later with some 200 
passengers. 
 
Number of Guns Smuggled into Turkey Soars after US Iraq Invasion 
Islamist-oriented Zaman cites an article in a police periodical 
which reports that weapons and munitions smuggled into Turkey from 
Iraq have increased by 235 percent following the US military 
intervention in Iraq in 2003.  Several armed assassination attempts 
including the deadly attack on Council of State (Danistay) and the 
killing of Italian Priest Santoro in Trabzon have been carried out 
with unlicensed arms smuggled from northern Iraq.  In 2006, more 
than 50 percent of illegal weapons seized were taken in the Turkish 
provinces on the border with Iraq and Syria, according to the 
report. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Palestine 
Kamuran Ozbir comments on Iraq and Palestine in the nationalist 
Ortadogu:  "The Gaza strip is a stage for demonstrating the US 
Administration's double- standard in the name of democracy.  If the 
US really were after democracy, it would not blockade Palestine and 
cause hunger, but would accept dialog with the Palestinian 
representatives.  Palestinian leaders should understand that 
Palestinians will never forgive the sale of the political system to 
foreigners in return for money or power.  Even though it sounds 
unbelievable, the fact is freedom is much more valuable for the 
Palestinians than food.  I hope the parties involved in this game 
come to understand this fact soon."
