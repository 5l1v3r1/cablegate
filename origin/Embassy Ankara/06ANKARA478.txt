                         A QUICK LOOK AT THE TURKISH PRESS 
                                        February 6, 2006 
 
In Today's Papers 
 
Reaction Grows Against Cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed 
All papers:  Muslims around the world continued 
demonstrations to protest against the publishing of cartoons 
of the Prophet Mohammed.  Demonstrators set fire to the 
Danish and Norwegian Embassies in Damascus and Danish 
Consulate in Beirut.  In an effort to reduce tensions over 
the issue, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul launched an 
initiative to bring the Islamic world and European countries 
together in a common forum for dialogue.  Turkish Embassies 
in Europe will convey this call to the relevant countries. 
Meanwhile, protests in Turkey against the cartoons is also 
growing.  Small-scale (less than 1,000) demonstrations were 
held in Ankara, Izmir, Sivas, Batman, Sirnak, and Istanbul, 
where about 700 demonstrators threw eggs at the Danish 
Consulate.  The Danish editor of the paper that initially 
published the cartoons has again refused to apologize, 
saying that 'cartoons of Jesus in a very unfavorable light 
were published by Turkish papers in the past.'  Prime 
Minister Erdogan criticized the violence, saying that `the 
publication of these cartoons was wrong, but burning and 
destroying is just as wrong.  This issue can only be 
resolved at the table.'  PM Erdogan and Spanish PM Zapatero 
published a joint letter in todays International Herald 
Tribune calling for calm and moderation. 
 
Commenting on the issue, Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in the 
conservative Turkiye: "It was very important and pleasing to 
see the reactions from western world, from the Pope to the 
US president and the German PM, who made a distinction 
between insulting sacred values and freedom of expression. 
The remedy is mutual tolerance and empathy.  Otherwise, we 
will be led to a war based on religion, which the 
international community cannot possibly bear." 
 
Yasemin Congar reported from Washington in the mainstream 
Milliyet: "Muslims in North America have showed a relatively 
calm reaction against the cartoons published in the European 
dailies.   They must have been thinking about what the 
Prophet Mohammad would do." 
 
Erdal Safak observed in the mass appeal Sabah "The cartoon 
crisis has indeed helped the despotic regimes of the Middle 
East.  This is clearly seen if you take a close look at the 
events in Syria and Lebanon.  All of this indicates the 
importance of secularism more than ever before." 
 
Fehmi Koru observed in the Islamist opinion maker Yeni 
Safak: "This is a campaign intended to elicit a backlash 
from the Islamic world.  This is a disgusting and demonic 
ploy.  Remaining silent and copping out in the face of this 
insult or taking to the streets and engaging in riots will 
make the project successful.  Are we going to fall into this 
trap?" 
 
 
Catholic Priest Murdered in Trabzon 
Milliyet, Vatan, Posta, Sabah, Hurriyet and others:  An 
Italian priest at the Roman Catholic Church in the 
northeastern port city of Trabzon was shot dead at the door 
of his Church by a young man yesterday afternoon.  Some 
papers are connecting the murder with protests against 
cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed published in European 
papers.  He killing of the priest is referred to as a `huge

provocation.'  Turkish government spokesman Minister Cicek 
said 'the government is deeply sorry about the assault. 
Such acts cannot be considered legitimate, no matter what 
the reason and who the perpetrators are.'  The investigation 
into the murder continues, but there have been no arrests. 
 
Iran Ends Cooperation with IAEA 
All papers:  Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki announced on 
Sunday that Iran had ended all voluntary cooperation with 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) because of the 
IAEA decision to refer Iran to the UN Security Council over 
its nuclear program.  The announcement means that Iran will 
no longer allow IAEA inspectors to its nuclear facilities. 
 
Secretary Rice Postpones Visit to Turkey 
 
SIPDIS 
Vatan, Hurriyet:  The visit of Secretary Rice to Turkey, 
which was expected to take place in February, has reportedly 
been postponed until the spring.  According to Vatan, the 
visit has been postponed because of the Iran issue and the 
recent release of the the Turkish movie 'Valley of the 
Wolves-Iraq,' which depicts alleged atrocities by US forces 
in Iraq. 
 
Diyarbakir Mayor Baydemir's Visit to the US: 
Sabah(2/5), Hurriyet, Vatan, The New Anatolian:  Diyarbakir 
Mayor Osman Baydemir's visit to the US has caused some 
controversy in diplomatic circles.  According to a US 
Embassy spokesman, Baydemir is not visiting the US as the 
official guest of the US Government, but is participating at 
a conference on municipal administration.  Foreign Minister 
Abdullah Gul warned Baydemir against `political shows' and 
urged him to concentrate on his primary duties as mayor - 
addressing the needs of the people of Diyarbakir.  The US 
Embassy spokesman denied reports that Mayor Baydemir will be 
hosted at `high levels' by the US State Department. 
 
 
TV HIGHLIGHTS 
NTV News (0700) 
 
Focus on Turkey 
 
- The Italian priest at a Catholic church in Trabzon was 
killed by an unknown gunman.  Government ministers strongly 
condemn the attack, and efforts continue to find the 
perpetrator. 
- Scenes of protest from around Turkey as anger grows over 
the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad. 
Nationalists headed a demonstration of several hundred in 
Istanbul, hurling eggs at the Danish Consulate. 
 
- AKP parliamentarian Faruk Celik was shot and wounded in 
Bursa.  The wound is not serious, and the motive for the 
attack does not appear to be political. 
 
Focus on the United States 
 
Protesters demonstrated in Washington, calling for President 
Bush to resign.  The protesters are shown burning an 
American flag, as a commentator describes the `continued 
plunge' in popular support for President Bush. 
 
US Republican Senator Arlen Specter said that wiretapping of 
American citizens without a court order is `a violation of 
the law,' thereby escalating the `eavesdropping scandal' for 
the Bush Administration.
