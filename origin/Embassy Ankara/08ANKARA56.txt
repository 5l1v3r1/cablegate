¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of weekly reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary source is the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) website, which documents contacts and clashes with the PKK, as 
well as casualties incurred. 
 
¶2. (U) During the January 1 - 7, 2008 reporting period, no GOT 
security official was killed but 17 were reported injured in an 
explosion in Diyarbakir.  When a remote car bomb was detonated in 
the evening of January 3 in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, six 
civilians were killed and a total of 67, including 17 military, were 
injured.  The PKK later apologized for the explosion.  The total 
number of security force casualties for the year through January 7, 
2008 was zero killed and 17 injured. 
 
¶3. (U) During the same period, no PKK terrorist was killed.  One 
PKKer surrendered and three were captured.  According to official 
TGS website figures, through the end of the first week of January, 
the number of PKK militants killed this year was zero, the number of 
those captured was three, and the number of those who surrendered 
was one. 
 
¶4. (U) Civilian casualties for the year through the end of the first
