SUBJECT: TURKEY REVIEWING A CONTRIBUTION TO AFGHAN ELECTION 
BUDGET DEFICIT 
 
REF: STATE 57541 
 
 Per reftel request, we discussed with MFA Deputy Director 
General for South Asia Affairs Babur Hizlan the budget 
shortfall remaining from Afghanistan's 2005 parliamentary 
elections.  Hizlan said Turkey was aware of the shortfall and 
would review the request for a contribution towards the 
reduction of that deficit.  He noted, however, that Turkey is 
already searching for funds to cover the stand-up of its PRT 
in Wardak province which is scheduled to begin operation this 
summer.  Turkey has pledged $100M in reconstruction 
assistance to Afghanistan, but those funds cannot be used to 
establish the necessary infrastructure for Turkey's PRT. 
Hizlan was unsure whether they could be utilized  to make a 
contribution to reduce the election budget deficit, or 
whether other funds are available, but pledged Turkey's 
review of the request.
