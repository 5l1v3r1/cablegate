¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) From June 23 to 30, 2007, five security personnel, including 
a village guard, died in clashes with the PKK or in IED explosions. 
During the same period four security officials, including one 
village guard, were wounded in action (WIA).  So far in June, 23 
were KIA and 51 WIA.  Casualty figures for June exceed those from 
May, when 15 security personnel were KIA and 42 WIA. 
 
¶3. (U) From June 23 to 30, 15 PKK terrorists were killed in action 
and nine arrested, including seven who surrendered to security 
officials. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported around ten clashes between security 
forces and PKK terrorists in the region.  Security forces unearthed 
at least a dozen PKK shelters and caves and seized booby-trapped 
land mines; other explosives, including A-4 and TNT; Kalashnikov 
rifles; cartridges; hand grenades; pistols; night vision binoculars; 
TV sets; satellite antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. (U) On June 23, the PKK attacked a Jandarma Station in Ovacik, 
Tunceli with a tanker truck.  The PKK suicide bomber and the tanker 
driver, who was actually a civilian kidnapped by the bomber died in 
the incident. 
 
¶6. (U) On June 25 the PKK derailed a cargo train in Gaziantep. 
 
¶7. (U) Activity as reported by TGS website:
