In Today's Papers 
 
Earthquake Warning from Kandilli Observatory 
All papers give extensive coverage to the warning from Kandilli 
Observatory and Seismology Institute Director Gulay Altay, who 
stated, "There is seismic activity in the northern and southern 
parts of the Marmara Sea, as well as in Saros bay.  The earthquake 
risk is still high."  Mainstream Sabah quotes Altay as saying, "A 
five or six point magnitude earthquake will occur in Turkey.  This 
information should be communicated to the people by the experts as 
clearly as possible." 
 
Turkey - KRG Rapprochement; DTP Delegation Meets with KRG 
Representatives 
Sabah, Milliyet, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Yeni Safak, Vatan and others: 
Liberal Radikal reports that Ankara decided to intensify its 
dialogue with the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) in northern 
Iraq.  A delegation of Turkish officials headed by Turkey's special 
envoy to Iraq Murat Ozcelik will go to northern Iraq next week to 
meet with KRG President Massoud Barzani.  Radikal notes that U.S. 
Ambassador Ross Wilson told reporters, "The U.S. has worked hard to 
include the Kurdish administration in the fight against PKK.  In 
time, dialogue will intensify and will produce more visible and 
concrete results."  Mainstream Milliyet reports that KRG Prime 
Minister Nechirvan Barzani told the press, "We want good relations 
with Turkey.  We do not support PKK violence in Turkey and we do not 
condone the PKK's practice of launching attacks against Turkey from 
northern Iraq.  We are not responsible for PKK attacks and we have 
no influence over the organization.  However, we can exert efforts 
towards a political solution to the issue." 
 
Meanwhile, papers report that KRG President Massoud Barzani rejected 
a meeting request from Turkey's DTP delegation.  The delegation, led 
by Ahmet Turk, is in northern Iraq for meetings with Iraqi 
officials. 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: Turkey-Iraq/PKK 
 
"General Buyukanit: There Will Be A Surprise." 
Muharrem Sarikaya wrote in mainstream Sabah (5/9): "Turkish General 
Staff (TGS) Chief General Yasar Buyukanit recently told reporters 
there will be a major surprise announcement in a few days.  It is 
clear this surprise announcement is in connection with last week's 
intense air operations against PKK targets in northern Iraq.  It 
appears that, in a few days, a key PKK official might be handed over 
to Turkey or confirmed dead.   As Buyukanit highlighted, Turkish 
Armed Forces have the power in the region.  This winter's land 
operations played a large role in securing this power.  After many 
years, the PKK's communications are cut and their leaders are no 
longer comfortable." 
 
 
"Rapprochement With Iraqi Kurds Strengthens Domestic Peace" 
Ferai Tinc wrote in mainstream Hurriyet (5/9): "The changes in 
Turkey's policy toward northern Iraq will contribute to domestic 
peace in Turkey.  Turkey's decision to improve ties with the KRG and 
all other elements in Iraq is a comforting message for the Kurds. 
The troubles between Turkey and Iraqi Kurds began in the 1990s, 
after the PKK established itself in northern Iraq.  Thus, Turkey's 
fight against the PKK is perceived by many as fight against the 
Kurds, and this creates the impression that Turkey wants to destroy 
the Kurds.  This perception can hardly be changed without making 
changes in the fight against the PKK and in policies regarding the 
Kurdish issue.  Improving ties with Iraq will have an important 
effect on steps to solve problems regarding internal Kurdish issues. 
 Radical Islamic terror organizations are trying to take advantage 
of the chaos in Iraq and are trying to establish themselves in 
northern Iraq.  The threat from Islamic terrorists is going to be 
the new challenge for Iraq and Turkey in the years ahead.  Efforts 
to improve ties with northern Iraq will help Turkey strengthen ties

with Iraq and will contribute to domestic peace in Turkey." 
 
 
DTP Asks for Additional Time to Prepare its Defense 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak and mainstream Sabah and Milliyet 
report the pro-Kurdish DTP made a second request for addition time 
to prepare its defense in the closure case launched against it. 
When the chief prosecutor submitted new evidence, including 33 
folders of documents and 107 CDs and DVDs, the DTP asked the 
Constitutional Court for time to review the evidence. 
 
Barroso: "Secularism Cannot Be Imposed by Force" 
Sabah, Hurriyet, Milliyet, Radikal, Yeni Safak, Vatan and others: 
All papers report European Commission President Barroso told a 
meeting in Slovenia, "Turkey must be fully democratic and secular 
before it can become a full EU member."  In addition, he noted that 
"secularism cannot be imposed by force."
