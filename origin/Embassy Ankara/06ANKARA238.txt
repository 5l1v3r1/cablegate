Â¶1. (SBU) On January 20 we met with Peyami 
Ciklakalyoncu, attache in the MFA's Deputy Directorate 
General for International Political Organizations, 
regarding the USG's nomination of Ambassador (retired) 
Melvyn Levitsky to the International Narcotics Control 
Board (INCB).  Ciklakalyoncu told us that the GOT is 
aware of this election and will consider our candidate, 
but had not yet taken a position on who it will 
support. He promised to notify us when the GOT makes a 
decision.
