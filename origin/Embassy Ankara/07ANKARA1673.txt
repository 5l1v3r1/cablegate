SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT 
THURSDAY, JUNE 28, 2007 
 
 
In Today's Papers 
 
Restructuring of Turkish Military against the PKK 
All papers report that as part of the media tour to Commando 
Training School in Isparta-Egirdir yesterday, TGS Chief Buyukanit 
and Land Forces Commander General Ilker Basbug answered questions at 
a press conference.  General Basbug said at the press conference 
that the fight against PKK terrorists will be carried out by Special 
Forces which will consist of all professionals.  Mainstream Hurriyet 
reports that the six commando brigade members, which are responsible 
for domestic security, will be replaced by professional commandos by 
Â¶2009. 
 
General Buyukanit Comments on Cross-Border Operation 
All papers report that at the press conference at Egirdir, TGS Chief 
General Buyukanit reiterated the need for a cross-border operation 
into northern Iraq.  General Buyukanit was quoted as saying "we 
cannot say that we will enter the north of Iraq and eradicate the 
PKK, but such a move will be a serious blow to the terrorist 
organization."  Responding to a question General Buyukanit said 
"obviously, we had various requests and demands from the US.  At 
this point, we cannot say that the US extended sufficient support to 
our fight against PKK."   While PM Erdogan told reporters that he 
could not comment on General Buyukanit remarks until evaluating 
them, in an exclusive interview with Islamic oriented Yeni Safak 
Foreign Minister Gul said "all options are on the table and I 
couldn't say that a cross border operation wouldn't take place 
before the elections." 
 
Papers and TV channels report that US State Department Spokesman 
Sean McCormack said that "the US doesn't think an operation into 
Iraq from Turkey is going to help the situation, either in the 
short, medium, or long term" and that "the solution here is to have 
the Turkish Government and the Iraqi Government work together to 
address what is a common threat." 
 
Iraqi PM Maliki will not Come to Turkey in the near Future 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports that while attending the 
energy conference in Istanbul, Maliki's spokesperson Ali-al-Debbag 
said that PM Nouri Al-Maliki would not be able to pay a visit to 
Turkey in the near future.  This message disturbed the AKP 
government since they were hoping to host Maliki before June 30. 
 
Turkey to Pay Back Assets to an Armenian Foundation 
Mainstream Milliyet reports that the European Court of Human Rights 
(ECHR) ruled that Turkey should return the assets of Yedikule Surp 
Pirgic Armenian Hospital Foundation, seized in 1998.  The ECHR 
ordered Turkey to pay 15,000 Euro court expenses as well.
