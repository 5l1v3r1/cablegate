¶1.  Summary. There are 18 human cases confirmed by local 
testing, so far, but no new deaths.  There is still no 
evidence of human-to-human transmission.  The geographic 
distribution of the confirmed cases continues to broaden 
with the two new cases in southeastern Turkey.  Official 
sources now put at 24 the number of provinces with suspected 
or confirmed AI in birds, of which 11 have been confirmed by 
test results.  Not all of these 11 may be H5N1, however. 
350,000 birds have been culled and a Agriculture official 
told us the Ministry is now planning to cull all birds 
outside of commercial operations.  The public information 
campaign continues to ramp up.  End Summary. 
 
--------------- 
Cases in Humans 
--------------- 
 
¶2. MOH official told us there are now 18 human cases that 
have tested positive locally for H5N1: besides the 15 
previously-reported cases there are two new cases in 
Sanliurfa and Siirt (both in southeastern Turkey).  The 
southeastern Turkey cases represent a continued geographic 
broadening: until now the confirmed human cases had been 
only in far eastern Turkey and north-central Anatolia.  The 
eighteenth confirmed case is the third sibling of the 
original family in Dogubeyazit whose earlier test (based on 
nasal swabs) had come up negative. Now, testing based on 
body tissue confirmed H5N1, as had been suspected.  This 
brings the total number of provinces with confirmed human 
cases to 9.  No new deaths have been confirmed.  There is 
still no evidence of human-to-human transmission.

Animal cases:

¶3. A Ministry of Agriculture official told us that of the 24 
provinces with confirmed or suspected AI in birds, only 11 
have confirmed test results showing AI.  The official said 
he believed that the cases that tested positive the birds 
did not necessarily test positive for H5N1 (it could just be 
H5). Press reports suggest a larger number of provinces--up 
to 28--have cases in birds. 
 
¶4. 350,000 birds have been culled so far.  The Ministry of 
Agriculture official also told us the Ministry is now 
 
ANKARA 00000133  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
planning to cull all birds (presumably only domestic fowl) 
in Turkey outside of commercial operations.  Separately, the 
Chamber of Commerce called for also culling some of the 
commercial operations' birds, as well as all other birds, 
for an estimated total of 8 million birds.  For the 
commercial operations, the idea is for the GOT to compensate 
the companies, since the companies have limited storage 
capacity and can no longer afford to keep feeding the birds. 
 
¶5. The Minister of Agriculture held a meeting with 
southeastern officials in the city of Diyarbarkir followed 
by a press conference.  He said the map of confirmed cases 
reflects the pattern of bird migration, stressed the 
importance of education people and committed that people 
would be compensated for culled birds. 
 
--------------------------- 
Public Information Campaign 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6. There are news reports that the public education campaign 
has reached all 81 provinces, with leaflets, posters, local 
and national radio and TV, and short films being used. 
There is a special effort to target children and parents. 
The authorities' efforts may often not be via mass media; 
many areas affected by AI are not reached by Turkish 
television, for example.  We have some evidence that local 
authorities are addressing their constituents in Kurdish - 
for example in Dogubeyazit - and this would obviously be 
helpful with those rural citizens who may not speak or 
understand Turkish well.  Our impression is that the 
authorities are doing a good job now of getting the word 
out, and post will seek opportunities in coming days to get 
a better sense of how effective the authorities' efforts are 
at the local level. 
 
¶7. As discussed during Ambassador's consultations in 
Washington, post strongly urges the dispatch as soon as 
possible to Turkey and other countries in the region (e.g., 
the Caucasus) of an interagency and multi-disciplinary team 
to assess the operational effectiveness of Turkish and 
international work on the AI issue here, identify gaps and 
lessons learned, and make recommendations on possible 
bilateral assistance, technical assistance or other support 
in Turkey, as well as in the Caucasus countries.
