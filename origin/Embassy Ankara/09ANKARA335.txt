SUBJECT: TURKEY: REQUEST FOR EMBASSY SCIENCE FELLOW 
 
REF: STATE 10843 
 
¶1.  Embassy Ankara is pleased to submit a request for a 
Science Fellow to come to Ankara for a month TDY during the 
summer of 2010.  Embassy Ankara was fortunate to ave hosted 
a Fellow in 2007 who worked with Turkey's national scientific 
and research body (TUBITAK) to explore opportunities for 
scientific exchange and partnership.  Our proposal is to 
build on the connections made in 2007, and expand our reach 
to the science departments of several premier universities in 
Ankara.  We hope to bridge between the research and academic 
communities of the U.S. and Turkey.  We would like the Fellow 
to have a solid background in grant and proposal writing. 
The Fellow would assist Turkish universities in identifying 
applicable research funding at U.S. institutions, explain how 
to apply for U.S. sponsored grants and help establish 
partnerships with U.S. universities.  TUBITAK has extensive 
research grant resources, and the Fellow would also look at 
ways to foster joint US-Turkish research projects in Turkey. 
The Government of Turkey recently acceded to the Kyoto 
Protocol and is working to implement more "green" energy 
solutions.  Expertise in climate change, carbon sequestration 
and renewable energy technology would be helpful, but is not 
required. 
 
¶2.  The Fellow would be the primary Embassy point of contact 
for all science and technology related issues during his/her 
TDY.  The Fellow would maintain and expand Embassy's network 
of contacts with TUBITAK and other universities.  The Fellow 
would work closely with Post's Deputy Economic Counselor and 
other appropriate Embassy staff involved in science and 
technology issues. 
 
¶3.  Timing of the TDY is critical.  Post cannot commit to 
housing and office, and cannot commit to support for the 
Science Fellow until timing is determined.  Post will be in 
touch with OES/STC and sponsoring agency to discuss potential 
timing. 
 
¶4.  Post would provide other logistical support listed in 
reftel (CLO, security, health unit, e-mail access).  Security 
clearance is required.  In-country travel is not anticipated, 
but, should it be deemed necessary, ECON funds would be used. 
 Turkish is not required.  We will work with a prospective 
Fellow on exact scientific expertise, program duration, and 
timing (four to six weeks commencing mid-June 2010 is highly 
preferred). 
 
¶5.  Post POC is Deputy Economic Counselor Rebecca Neff, 
(90-312)457-7068; neffrh@state.gov.
