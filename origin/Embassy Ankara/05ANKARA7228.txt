SUBJECT: INFORMATION ON TURKISH GOVERNMENT INTERACTION WITH 
TERRORIST VICTIMS NGOS 
 
REF: STATE 218921 
 
¶1.  There are a number of groups/NGOs in Turkey which support 
victims of terrorist attacks and their families, specifically 
victims of PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party).  The two largest 
organizations, EMSAD and ASAYDD, participated with us at this 
year's 9/11 commemoration at a local martyrs' monument. 
Information on these two NGOs follows per reftel. 
 
     ¶A.  EMSAD - Police Martyrs' Families Association.  This 
association, whose members are mostly widows, aims to help 
family members of policemen killed by terrorists in the line 
of duty by providing educational contributions to their 
children.  The association has no known international 
interaction.  The chairperson is Nursen Donmez, Fevzi Cakmak 
2 Sok. No. 34/6, Kizilay, Ankara.  Website: 
www.emniyetsehitaileleri.org. 
 
     ¶B.  ASAYDD -- Ankara Association for Solidarity with and 
Assistance to the Families of Martyred Soldiers.  Rather than 
a national single association, there are separate 
associations in each province.  ASAYDD serves as a lobbying 
group and provides members with moral support.  Some 
provincial governors offer office space to the organization. 
The group has no known international interaction. 
Chairperson is Hamit Kose, Necatibey Caddesi Sezenler Sokak 
1/13, Sihhiye, Ankara.  Website:  www.sehitler.org. 
 
¶2.  While the Ministry of Interior has an office dealing with 
such associations, it merely regulates their operations and 
does not facilitate any contact. We believe it best to 
approach these organizations directly to facilitate potential 
ties with U.S. NGOs.
