General for EU and External Relations, Riza Mehmet Korkmaz, 
his deputy Ihsan Kocer, and his Training and EU Accession 
Harmonization officers, Sevil Karaca and Aysin Ozguven.  We 
discussed the proposed VIP visit request of Director General 
for Customs Enforcement Neset Erkoc (contained at end of 
section A. of last months cable). Korkmaz agreed this would 
be a valuable visit for Erkoc since he is new to Customs.  He 
noted that this fall would be an ideal time for this visit 
and should include members of both Customs and Customs 
Enforcement, with Erkoc  the Head of delegation.  Advisor 
noted that the dates will need to be worked out with ISN/ECC 
and DHS/CBP and that we would notify him of proposed dates 
and begin planning this visit.  (Note: Ankara 1441 includes 
an action request to plan this VIP visit during early - mid 
November, if possible. Customs is seeking this visit as soon 
as possible.  End Note). 
 
2)  Aug 13 - Met again with Deputy Ihsan Kocer for lunch to 
discuss the need to move ahead with updating Turkish Custom 
training curriculum even though the new training academy 
concept has been suspended.  Turkish Customs has not had a 
formal training program for new Customs officers or

years.  Advisor noted that DHS/CBP is available to move ahead 
in support of Turkish curriculum development efforts as soon 
as possible.

curriculum. 
 
4) Aug 16 - EXBS Advisor met w/Pacific Northwest Laboratory 
(PNL) training team members Michael Tinker and Shannon

in Turkey, Turkish sensitivities toward the SLD program, and 
general security awareness issues for Ankara.

team and worked with team to set up training rooms for

8) Aug 26 - EXBS Team and Craig Nelson, from PNL team, met 
w/TNP Assistant Director for Counter-terrorism and Operations 
Division, Ahmet Yayla and TNP Bomb Academy Deputy Director 
Apaydin at the Bomb Academy.  Advisor and Nelson previewed 
the training provided to Turkey to date and solicited Yayla 
and Apaydin's views on the next phase of DOE/SLD - TNP 
engagement.  Yayla asked for additional hand-held equipment 
for all TNP bomb experts and requested to have PNL provide 
TNP with train-the-trainer curriculum and training to empower 
TNP to provide this training themselves in the future.  A 
full report was sent via email to DOE/SLD's Erik Deschler by 
Craig Nelson regarding future TNP requirements.
