BRIEFING 
 
CIA Director Porter Goss Visit:  The meetings of CIA 
Director Porter Goss continued to dominate the front pages 
of the papers.  "Hurriyet" reports that the CIA will use 
special technology to stop the infiltration of PKK 
terrorists into Turkey from Northern Iraq.  The system will 
be able to alert Turkey of movements at the border so that 
security officials can take necessary steps against the 
terrorists.  "Milliyet' says Goss asked for Turkey's close 
cooperation against Al-Qaeda. "Vatan" says the reason for 
the Goss visit was to ask for more cooperation against 
Syria, Iran and Al-Qaeda.  "Aksam" reports that the CIA 
director's responded positively to Turkey's request for a 
cross-border operation against PKK.  The cross-border 
operation will be discussed during Secretary Rice's visit to 
Turkey at the end of January.  "Sabah" says that Goss had 
two requests from Turkish officials: the first was for 
cooperation in intelligence service activities against 
Islamic terror; and the second was that CIA agents going to 
work in Islamic countries be trained by Turkey.  Turkish 
officials, in return, reminded the director of the PKK issue 
and reiterated Turkey's expectation for concrete steps 
against the PKK.  All papers report that the CIA director 
met with Emre Taner, the head of the National Intelligence 
Organization (MIT) yesterday and would meet with PM Erdogan 
today. "Cumhuriyet" reports that the CIA director presented 
 
ANKARA 00007303  002 OF 003 
 
 
Turkish officials with three files: one on Iran's nuclear 
activities, another on Iran's support for Al-Qaeda and PKK, 
and the third on the anti-Turkish activities of Iran.  Goss 
reportedly warned Turkey of possible air strikes against 
Iran and Syria. 
 
Justice Minister Comments on Goss Visit: "Yeni Safak" 
highlights Justice Minister and government spokesman Cemil 
Cicek's remarks that `Turkey has expectations of the US 
regarding the PKK.  The Goss visit should be evaluated 
within this framework." 
 
Khalilzad Remarks on Kurds:  "Sabah" cites CNN-TV as a 
source to highlight US Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad's 
remarks on Kurds.  Khalilzad was quoted as saying "Barzani, 
Talabani and I talked repeatedly and have decided that it is 
better for the Kurds to remain a part of Iraq rather than to 
go on their own as an independent state, since they'll be 
isolated with many enemies around them.  Under these 
conditions the survival of a mini Kurdish State would not be 
possible." 
 
Assassination of Lebanese Journalist/Parliamentarian:  All 
papers reported on the car bomb in Beirut killing an anti- 
Syrian journalist, Gibran Tueni, with most pointing a finger 
at Syria. 
 
Shortened (Paid) Military Service:  "Hurriyet" and 
"Cumhuriyet" report that the Turkish General Staff yesterday 
moved to end a debate on shorter military service started by 
PM Erdogan on his recent visit to Australia.  Opposing the 
idea, the TGS stressed that such changes would be unfair 
while the country's fight against terrorism continues. 
 
Orhan Pamuk Case:  "Radikal" reports that an Istanbul court 
has asked the Justice Ministry for permission to try Pamuk 
according to the former penal code.  The penal code was 
amended recently within the framework of EU harmonization 
reforms.  Justice Minister Cicek's approval is needed for 
the trial.  Minister Cicek however refuses to comment on the 
issue. 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION:  US-Turkey Relations; Iraq 
 
"New Understanding with the US" 
Sami Kohen observed in the mainstream "Milliyet" (12/13): 
"Given the recent visitor traffic and increased number of 
contacts, the relationship between Turkey and the US has 
reached a new level of understanding.  The basis of this 
understanding is to focus on the problem areas in bilateral 
ties and turn them into areas of cooperation.  A constant 
and constructive dialogue is needed to achieve this goal, 
which is the reason for the busy visitor traffic to and from 
the United States. As Ambassador Ross Wilson pointed out 
very recently, as far as Turkish-American relations are 
concerned, the US goal is to eliminate both people's 
concerns rather than simply maintain good relations. 
Obviously Iraq is the main issue of concern.  The PKK in 
northern Iraq seems to be the main issue between Washington 
and Ankara.  It looks like the US officials have understood 
well that the relationship will not stay on track unless the 
current differences related to the PKK have been eliminated. 
On the other hand, it would be unrealistic to expect the US 
forces to wipe out the PKK with a military operation. 
Nevertheless it seems possible that the US will start taking 
steps toward breaking down PKK influence.  Turkey and the US 
are searching for ways to change their disputes into 
cooperation.  If the new understanding continues, the search 
will be successful."

"Looting Iraqi Oil" 
Haluk Ulman commented in the economic-politic "Dunya" 
(12/13): "One of the reasons for the Iraq war, as far as the 
Bush administration is concerned, was to control the future 
of oil reserves by positioning itself in Iraq.  The US plans 
to give these reserves over to American multi-national 
companies and to have a strong say in fixing oil prices in 
OPEC. Steps have already been taken in this regard.  The 
occupiers have it made possible for foreign oil companies to 
operate in Iraq.  In the first nine months of 2006, Iraqi 
oil reserve operations will be contracted out to western oil 
companies.  In other words, foreign companies will be able 
to re-enter the Iraqi oil business for the first time since 
1972 when Iraqi oil reserves were nationalized." 
 
"The Exit Strategy" 
Mehmet Barlas wrote in the mass appeal "Sabah" (12/13): "In 
Iraq, the exit strategy, rather than the victory, has become 
the major priority for the US.  This is about leaving Iraq 
before being defeated.  The US avoided international 
cooperation when it started the Iraq operation.  However, as 
former Secretary of State Kissinger warned recently, the US 
should have cooperated with Iraq's neighbors which were 
likely to be affected by Iraq's instability.  The success of 
the exit strategy will depend on whether or not Iraqi 
security forces manage to gain full control over the 
country.  In the aftermath of the December 15 elections, it 
is crucially important for the region as well as for 
countries with Muslim populations and for the world oil 
resources that Iraq has a legitimate government with 
territorial integrity."
