In Today's Papers 
 
Gul Continues Talks in the US 
All papers continue coverage of President Abdullah Gul's first visit 
to the US as president.  A senior American official who was not 
identified told the Turkish press after the Bush-Gul meeting that 
military measures alone were not sufficient and a comprehensive 
solution was needed to resolve the PKK question.  "Bush and Gul did 
not get into the specifics of either amnesty or a comprehensive 
solution," the official noted.  The official said the US encouraged 
Turkey to seek dialogue with the Iraqi Kurds with an eye to work out 
a long-term settlement.  Papers note that Gul, in contrast, told a 
gathering at Woodrow Wilson Center that a "political settlement" was 
not discussed in his talks in the White House.  "The PKK camps in 
northern Iraq are used to stage attacks in Turkey.  Do you think 
that in the US a political solution is possible to the al-Qaeda 
problem?" Gul said in response to a question at Wilson Center.  Gul 
stressed the ways for seeking a political settlement to the PKK 
problem were not raised in his recent or earlier meetings with 
American officials, adding Turkey would never discuss political 
solutions to the PKK issue.  On the other hand, mainstream Vatan and 
Islamist-oriented Zaman say a "political settlement" was not 
discussed in the Bush-Gul meeting, however, the sides discussed 
plans for economic and social reform in the southeast.  Mainstream 
Hurriyet reports US Ambassador to Turkey Ross Wilson denied the 
"political solution" matter was discussed between Bush and Gul, 
saying "We don't conduct such talks with Turkey." 
 
In a meeting with Turkish and American businessmen in Washington, 
Gul called for investments in east and southeast Turkey.  Gul also 
had talks with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and US Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen.  The Turkish 
President met later in the day with UNSYG Ban Ki-moon in New York to 
discuss Cyprus. 
 
Hurriyet, Radikal and Yeni Safak also report that American interest 
for energy investment opportunities in Turkey is growing. 
Mentioning Turkish Energy Minister's meeting with American energy 
firms, papers cite energy as the new fundamental aspect for future 
US investment in Turkey. 
 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkey's Kurdish Problem, Turkey-US Ties 
Okay Gonensin opined in mainstream Vatan (1/10):  "The talk about a 
comprehensive solution to the Kurdish problem indicates that the US 
Administration intends to meddle with our internal problems. 
Evidently, solving the Kurdish problem in Turkey has become an 
important issue for the US, particularly because of its role in 
northern Iraq.  It is true that Turkey and the northern Iraqi 
administration will be able to interact and cooperate effectively 
once the PKK issue is left behind.  On the other hand, Turkey should 
be able to consider its own Kurdish problem as a political and 
social problem and exert its own efforts to find a solution.  Such 
efforts will improve Turkey's relations with the northern Iraqi 
administration.  Turkey stands at a point where it should think 
about its own comprehensive solution.  There is no need to hear this 
from others concerning this issue." 
 
Soli Ozel wrote in mainstream Sabah (1/10): "If we look at Turkey as 
the center of the world, we overlook the dynamics in our region. 
Ignoring and underestimating external factors makes us blind to our 
own weaknesses.  If Turkey fails to establish a reasonable 
relationship with the Iraqi Kurds, it will be because of Turkey's 
own internal political balances.  However, the Gul visit to the US 
was successful, especially because energy cooperation seems to be 
the major component of bilateral relations in the period ahead. 
Given the current situation in Iraq, it comes as no surprise that 
the US wants to improve relations with Turkey.  It is very 
understandable for Washington to put effort into enhancing its ties 
with Turkey because Turkey is the region's only Muslim, secular,

capitalist and democratic country.  Turkey should be able to observe 
regional and international developments free from domestically-fed 
fears." 
 
Al-Qaeda Suspects Arrested in Van 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others 
report that six of of the 38 al-Qaeda linked suspects detained last 
week in Van have been formerly arrested.  Police launched an 
operation in Van in the face of the Turkish Hizbullah's efforts to 
regroup and searched some 40 homes and offices last week. 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet says Ibrahim Sari, the leader of 
those arrested, was captured in Afghanistan by US forces in 2001. 
Sari was kept in Guantanamo Bay prison until 2003 before he was 
handed over to Turkey and later released.  Cumhuriyet claims a 
police report submitted to the last National Security Council (MGK) 
had warned that the Hizbullah terror organization was working to 
restructure itself in southeast Turkey.  The report says Hizbullah 
changed tactics, trying to restructure through legal organizations 
such as "Mustazaf-Der" and "Inzar" magazine.  They extended help to 
5,000 families during Sacrifice Feast in 2006, and 3,000 families in 
2007, according to the report. 
 
Iran Resumes Natural Gas Supply to Turkey 
All papers report that regular natural gas shipments from Iran to 
Turkey will resume next week, possibly Monday.  Iran had said 
earlier this week that tough winter conditions in Iran caused a 
decrease in gas shipments to Turkey which also prompted a cease in 
gas shipments to Greece via Turkey.  The Iranian Petroleum Ministry 
said Iran will gradually increase supply of natural gas to Turkey. 
Meanwhile, Russia's Gazprom has increased the amount of natural gas 
sent to Turkey and Greece via the Blue Stream gas pipeline. 
 
Anti-Americanism Dropped to 89% in Turkey 
Sabah and Aksam report that following the recent US-Turkey 
cooperation, anti -Americanism dropped from 96% to 89%.  The 
chairman of the Turkey-US caucus in parliament, AKP Antalya Deputy 
Mevlut Cavusoglu, told the visiting US Senators that 'according to 
an un-named polling company, positive sentiments against the US in 
Turkey increased from 4% to 9% following the increased intelligence 
sharing against the PKK'.  Separately, the MP noted "378 deputies 
became members of the Turkey-US caucus in the parliament; 304 from 
AKP, 41 from MHP, 18 from CHP and two from DTP." 
 
Prominent Alevi Organizations Reject to Attend Iftar Dinner 
Organized by the Ruling AKP 
Sabah, Cumhuriyet, Taraf, Star, Vatan:  Papers report that Alevi 
Studies Center President Ali Yildirim said that those who attend the 
Alevi Iftar dinner organized by AKP deputy Reha Camuroglu would be 
defamed, in other words, alienated from Alevi society.  Reportedly, 
12 prominent senior Alevi figures will meet today and hold a press 
conference.  They are expected to highlight the fact that this month 
is a month of mourning for Alevis and those who plan to attend the 
dinner will be warned for the last time.
