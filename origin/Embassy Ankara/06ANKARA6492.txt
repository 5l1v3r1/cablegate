¶1.  (SBU)  Energy Undersecretary Sami Demirbilek suggested 
the second week of January in Ankara for launching a 
U.S.-Turkey-Iraq working group on Iraqi gas (refs).  This 
timing should allow Energy Minister Guler to participate in a 
one-two day event.  (Starting this expert level group has 
been a long-standing request from the Minister.)  The next 
step would be for the the Department and Embassy Baghdad to 
identify USG and Government of Iraq experts to participate. 
We would like to forward the names and a firm date as soon as 
possible to the Energy Ministry.  Demirbilek thought the the 
group go beyond the geology to the economics and politics of 
working on development and egress of gas from Iraq, 
particularly via Turkey.
