¶1. Following consultations with relevant contacts in the 
Turkish National Police (TNP) and in the private sector, we 
are pleased to suggest the following candidate for the OSCE 
Counterterrorism Workshop to be held in Vienna February 
11-12, 2010.  TNP contacts may provide a TNP candidate, but 
were not certain they could find an appropriate one.  In the 
interim, we provide the following private sector candidate. 
 
Hasan ALSANCAK, Deputy General Manager for Energy Security, 
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline Company 
 
Mr. Alsancak began his career in June 1992 as Head of the 
International Criminal Intelligence Operations Bureau in the 
Intelligence Department of the Turkish National Police (TNP). 
 He subsequently headed the Intelligence, Research and 
Development units of the Protection Department of the Turkish 
Presidency B, 1998-2000.  Between January 2000 and February 
2003, he served in two crucial posts -- head of the TNP's 
Anti-Organized Crime Operations Bureau and head of the 
Financial Crime Investigations Bureau.  Prior to assuming his 
current position, he worked at the United Nations as Turkey's 
security advisor. 
 
Hasan Alsancak completed his undergraduate study in law 
enforcement at the Turkish Police Academy, and studied for 
his masters degree in criminal justice at the University of 
Virgina.  In 2000, he participated in the 205th Session of 
the FBI National Academy on Counterterrorism and 
Investigations.  In 2001, he completed a graduate degree in 
International Relations at Ankara's Gazi University.  His 
thesis topic was "The Role of Intelligence Agencies in 
Decision Making and Implementation Process of the Foreign 
Policy."
