Poloff discussed reftel talking points June 22 with Mehmet 
Kemal Bozay, Chief of Desk at the MFA Deputy Directorate 
General for the Middle East.  Bozay said he and other MFA 
Middle East specialists had been in Istanbul the previous 
week working on the OIC Summit, and had not focused on the 
Johnson murder.  He said he would discuss the issue with 
superiors.  On June 23, Gurcan Turkoglu, special assistant to 
FM Gul, informed DCM that Gul commented on the murder during 
a press conference in Brussels June 19.  Gul condemned the 
murder and stated that such acts "damage the image of a 
Muslim country as well as the image of Islam."  Turkoglu 
emphasized that the GOT feels strongly about the issue, 
noting that Gul made a direct statement that was not in 
response to a press query.  Gul raised the murder at the end 
of a press conference focused on EU issues; his statement was 
not widely covered in the press, but was reported by the 
Anatolia News Agency wire service and at least one Turkish 
daily.
