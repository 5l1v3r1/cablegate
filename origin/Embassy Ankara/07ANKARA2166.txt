In Today's Papers 
 
Sezer Asks Erdogan to Submit Cabinet List to New President 
All papers report Prime Minister Erdogan said on Thursday he was 
delaying the announcement of his new cabinet lineup after outgoing 
President Sezer refused to review it and asked the PM to hand the 
list to the next head of state instead.  Prime Minister Erdogan said 
President Sezer's move, which came as a "surprise," had been a 
positive "gesture."  Erdogan said that some revisions might now be 
made to the list.  Main opposition CHP said what the President did 
was both a "gesture" and "response" to the PM, recalling comments by 
Erdogan earlier this week that he would not accept any objections to 
the cabinet list from President Sezer. 
 
Editorial Commentary on President Sezer's Action 
Okay Gonensin writes in the mainstream daily Vatan: "President Sezer 
has served as a genuine opposition leader to the AKP government 
since 2002.  He chose to execute his authority to supervise and 
limit the government.  The latest 'gesture' with the cabinet list is 
in fact a serious blow to the government, maybe even the most 
serious one up to now.  His gesture meant that he gave a complete 
refusal to the cabinet list.  By acting this way, he avoided making 
any effort toward consensus and reconciliation.  Sezer has not taken 
into account the wishes of people who want reconciliation - a group 
not limited to those who voted for AKP.  Time will tell whether he 
did the right thing or not." 
 
Buyukanit Declines Comment on Presidency 
All papers report the chief of the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
General Yasar Buyukanit, at a reception at Presidential Palace on 
Thursday, said in response to press questions on the presidency that 
"everything that needs to be said has been said."  "They say that 
every time I speak up, the markets dive in Turkey.  The same thing 
happens if I don't speak at all.  What should I do, do a handstand?" 
said Buyukanit.  The TGS Chief said that in previous remarks he has 
only repeated what was written in the constitution, reiterating that 
the military wants a president whose words would be echoed in his 
conduct and attitude.  On whether Abdullah Gul would be allowed to 
attend the military-hosted August 30 reception with his wife, 
Buyukanit said, "Our principles are clear.  We will not fight with 
anyone, but neither will we leave aside those principles," implying 
that the reception venue rules forbidding the wearing of the 
headscarf would not be waived. 
 
Turkish Stock Market Takes a Dive 
All papers report that the sharp decline at US stock exchanges has 
negatively affected the world markets, including that of Turkey. 
The stock market in Turkey had its fastest decline in the last four 
years and lost 6.7 percent.  The Turkish currency dropped to its 
lowest level since March 14, falling 5.1 percent, the most of any 
currency against the dollar.  The US Dollar reached 1.415 YTL, its 
highest level since March. 
 
Ocalan's Prison Conditions to be Raised in Parliament 
Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet:  During a conversation with journalists 
yesterday, Nurettin Demirtas, the deputy chairman of the Democratic 
Society Party (DTP), said that the party would bring jailed PKK 
leader Abdullah Ocalan's living conditions in Imrali Prison to the 
agenda of the Parliament.  Demirtas claimed that Ocalan has been 
living under inhumane conditions in a cell in Imrali.  Demirtas 
added that his party will also bring the Ilisu Dam Project and the 
issue of forest fires in the southeast to the Parliamentary agenda. 
He was quoted as saying that "military operations are launched in 
the southeast almost everyday.  The forests have been set on fire 
with the excuse that they are security precautions.  The forest 
fires in Mardin, Hakkari, Sirnak and Dersim still continue because 
fire fighting is being prevented in these areas." 
 
Editorial Commentary on US Stance on Iranian Republican Guard 
Kubilay Celik writes in the nationalist daily Tercuman: "How could 
 
ANKARA 00002166  002 OF 002 
 
 
the US declare a country's army a terrorist organization?  This is 
kind of act is very hard to understand.  Nevertheless, the US 
administration has just accomplished another 'first' in the world by 
announcing that the Iranian army is a terrorist organization.  That 
means the Iranian army, from now on, will be treated as equal to 
Hamas, the PKK or al-Qaeda. President Bush is on his way to 
finishing his second and last term, and his performance during his 
tenure justifies the label 'terminator.'  He made the US 
unsympathetic to all, with the UK being the only exception.  With so 
many troubles and enemies, creating new tension should be the last 
thing the US does.  Despite this fact, President Bush, instead of 
giving some positive messages to the world before his term ends, is 
working toward creating new conflicts, such as calling the Iranian 
army terrorists.  The fact of the matter is that President Bush is 
handing over a world filled with fears and enemies to his 
successor."
