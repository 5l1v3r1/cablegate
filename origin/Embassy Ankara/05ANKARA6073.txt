We provided talking points and non-paper to MFA Balkans 
Department Head Hususi Kilic on October 3 and followed up 
October 6.  Kilic said the GOT supports our efforts and noted 
with satisfaction recent BiH success on defense reform and 
October 5 Republika Srpska National Assembly approval of the 
police reform proposal.  Kilic also reported Turkey supports 
the transformation of Office of the High Representative into 
an EU office and supports BiH membership in PfP and 
ultimately NATO.
