¶1. (U)  Action request at para. 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) A Turkish delegation headed by Minister of State Ali 
Babacan and Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCHOD) GEN 
Ergin Saygun and including Undersecretary for Defense 
Industries Murad Bayar, TGS J-5 Strategy Division Chief MGEN 
Serdar Savas and other officials will travel to Washington to 
attend the annual American-Turkish Council (ATC) conference 
from March 25-28.  Their participation in our largest 
bilateral business forum provides an opportunity to engage 
the Turkish businesses and government on US participation in 
the Turkish defense industry and address a host of bilateral 
issues from a Congressional resolution on an Armenian 
genocide to our cooperation against the PKK terrorist 
organization.  However, following recent visits to the US, 
Turkish military and civilian officials have raised 
complaints about perceived discriminatory treatment at US 
ports.  In an effort to ensure a productive visit on the eve 
of a possible genocide resolution and Turkish Presidential 
elections, post requests Department coordinate with the 
Turkish Embassy to smooth the entry of these officials in 
accordance with US security, immigration and customs 
requirements. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Following is a list of specific complaints received 
about perceived unfair treatment of Turkish officials at US 
borders.  While both civilian and military officials have 
complained of ill treatment during recent visits, the issue 
is of greatest sensitivity to the military who resist what 
they believe to be onerous security or immigration checks at 
airports and US government facilities that are not 
appropriate for their standing as a NATO ally: 
 
-- The Ankara Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) received a 
letter in June 2006 from TGS protesting that the delegation 
led by LTG Zorlu to the March 2006 ATC conference, which was 
traveling on NATO orders, had been sent to secondary 
inspection by Border Protection officials while seeking to 
depart the US at Reagan National Airport.  The MFA followed 
up with us to ask how to avoid this and similar problems in 
the future. 
 
-- During a November 2006 visit to Washington, GEN Saygun 
walked away from a meeting with NSC Hadley when security 
officials sought to "wand" him after he set off the 
magnetometer at the entrance to the OEOB. 
 
-- Also in 2006, three Turkish parliamentarians traveling on 
diplomatic passports with A-2 visas were singled out of a 
group of European MPs for additional security screening 
before boarding a Washington to Tampa flight. 
 
-- In January 2007, TGS sent a letter to ODC listing the TGS 
complaints above; requesting that Turkish military officials 
be accorded appropriate VIP treatment at US ports; and 
advising that if US could not accommodate this request, TGS 
may withdraw the right of US flag officers to VIP treatment 
when visiting Turkey.  In the absence of a similar VIP lounge 
arrangement at US airports, and in accordance with required 
security procedures, post worked with DOD and State Protocol 
to ensure a smooth entry and exit for CHOD GEN Yasar 
Buyukanit during his February 11-16, 2007 visit to New York 
and Washington.  Despite this, on March 5 TGS sent a second 
note to ODC stating that in the absence of revised protocol 
procedures for Turkish military officials visiting the United 
States, TGS would not accord VIP treatment to US flag 
officers who are not visiting Turkey at TGS invitation. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Following each of the complaints noted in para. 3, 
post notified the appropriate USG agencies in an effort to 
gain a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding 
each incident and to pave the way for future visits. 
However, we understand that ultimate responsibility for 
ensuring the smooth passage of Turkish officials through the 
US entry and exit process rests with the Turkish mission in 
Washington.  While the Turkish Embassy should be aware of the 
port courtesies available to foreign dignitaries and the 
procedures for requesting them, due to staffing turnover or 
other factors, it may not implement the necessary actions to 
secure them for every visitor. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Action Request: To assist the Turkish embassy to 
facilitate this process, post requests the Department and 
other relevant USG agencies to inform their counterparts at 
the Turkish mission of the available courtesies and requisite 
procedures and help to facilitate their completion for the 
upcoming ATC conference and for future visits.
