REF: IIR 6 898 0053 07

Classified By: DCM NANCY MCELDOWNEY FOR REASONS 1.4 (B,D).

¶1. (S/NF) The Turkish military has long been stalwart in opposing any deepening of ties between Turkey and Iran. The TGS (Turkish General Staff) sees Iran as one of its principal strategic threats and has been quite outspoken with us and with the Erdogan government in expressing concern about government efforts to improve bilateral relations between Ankara and Tehran. However, frustration over the PKK has caused them to rethink this approach, at least to the extent that cooperation with Iran will help them counter the PKK.

¶2. (S/NF) The TGS has recently come to us (ref IIR) to ask for direct US action against the PKK Annual Conference, to be held in the northern Iraqi town of Tengi Cehunge in March. They noted their overwhelming preference to work with us on interdicting this conference and in general to shut down the PKK. However, they have also gone to great lengths to note that if US action is not forthcoming, they will turn to the Iranians, who they claim are most eager to be helpful. As part of this dialogue, the TGS informed us on January 23 that they would receive four Iranian military officers in TGS headquarters on January 24 and underscored that their discussions would "heavily concentrate" on developments in Iraq and the Iraq/Iran border.

¶3. (S/NF) The Turks, including the TGS, are impatient for action and pressing hard. Erdogan has said publicly, and the TGS has repeatedly told us privately, that if we do not act against the PKK in the coming weeks, then Turkey will take military action of its own into northern Iraq.
