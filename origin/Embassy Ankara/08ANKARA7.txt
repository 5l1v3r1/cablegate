Ammunition and Drugs Seized from PKK Shelters in Diyarbakir and 
Bingol 
All papers report on the Turkish General Staff (TGS) announcement 
that security forces seized 550 kg of ammonium nitrate and 200 kg of 
illegal drugs from four PKK shelters in Diyarbakir and Bingol 
provinces.  The TGS said the drugs illustrate the role of the PKK in 
regional drug trafficking. 
 
Turkey's Ambassador to Iraq Meets Vice President Hashimi 
Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others report the 
Turkish ambassador to Iraq, Derya Kanbay, met the Iraqi Vice 
President Tariq al-Hashimi in Baghdad yesterday.  Discussions 
focused on the PKK and Turkish cross border operations into northern 
Iraq.  Vice President Hashimi asked Ambassador Kanbay for Turkey's 
coordination with the Iraqi government before launching future cross 
border attacks.  According to papers, Ambassador Kanbay said Turkey 
has been acting carefully not to harm civilians. 
 
Baykal: 2008 will be a Year of Constitutional Crisis 
Deniz Baykal, leader of the opposition CHP, told leftist-nationalist 
Cumhuriyet "2008 will be a year of constitutional crisis in Turkey," 
referring to government plans to overhaul the constitution.  Baykal 
claimed the AKP's draft of a new constitution would "deteriorate the 
unitary state structure, secularism, and judicial independence."  He 
added, "For the first time in Turkey, someone who has struggled 
against the values of the Republic of Turkey occupies the 
presidential post.  With the new constitution, they want to change 
the course of Turkey.  The debate over the constitution is not an 
ordinary one; it's an effort to radically change the state 
structure," Baykal emphasized. 
 
Every Year, 50,000 Illegal Immigrants Transit through Turkey to 
Europe 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports on its front page that in 
2007, approximately 50,000 illegal immigrants were detained in 
Turkey.  The illegal immigrants were passing through Turkey on their 
way to Europe, according to data released by the Turkish military. 
Over the past ten years, the number of illegal immigrants 
apprehended in Turkey reached 129,792.  Iraqis top the list of 
migrants with 5,065, followed by 5,050 Palestinians, and 1,668 
Mauritanians.  According to the report, migrants pay $500-$1,500 to 
human smugglers for passage.  Over the past twelve years, human 
trafficking in Turkey has become a $2 billion business. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkish Foreign Policy in 2008 
Sami Kohen observed in mainstream Milliyet (1/2):  "All signs 
indicate that Turkey will continue to engage in active foreign 
policy initiatives during 2008.  2008 inherits many problems from 
2007; let us evaluate some of these inherited problems. It is 
obvious that Turkey's cross-border operations will continue into 
northern Iraq until the PKK presence there is destroyed.  So far, 
the international community has supported these operations, but only 
because the aim and extent of the operations has remained limited. 
Thus, Turkey should be careful not to expand cross border operations 
to the point where the international community withdraws its 
support.  Next, Turkey must pay attention to developments in 
northern Iraq.  Turkey should carefully consider its relations with 
the Barzani Administration and with the Iraqi central government, 
remembering that the Kirkuk issue will play a major role in 
bilateral relations.  During the first half of 2007, relations with 
the US deteriorated, but relations improved immensely after the 
Bush-Erdogan meeting in November.  The bilateral strategic 
partnership against the PKK will continue.  It is unlikely that this 
new approach will change, even after the US presidential elections 
in November.  Next, Turkey needs to work with France in order to 
change Sarkozy's opinion about Turkey's EU membership.  Concerning 
Cyprus, Turkey may discover new opportunities after the elections in 
February.  Greek PM Karamanlis' visit to Turkey at the beginning of 
 
ANKARA 00000007  002 OF 002 
 
 
2008 will be a turning point for bilateral relations.  While Iran 
and Turkey are willing to continue their energy cooperation, 
possible sanctions against Iran may affect bilateral relations 
negatively.  Despite the new energy rivalry that has developed 
between the two countries, Turkey and Russia have worked for several 
years to strengthen their political and economic partnership.  In 
summary, the success of Turkey's foreign policy in 2008 depends on 
its ability to take advantage of the opportunities without sinking 
into the problems."
