SUBJECT: COMMISSION ON NARCOTICS DRUGS: REQUEST FOR US 
SUPPORT FOR TURKEY'S RE-ELECTION 
 
 
This is an action request. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Turkey has requested US support for its 
candidacy for re-election to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs 
(CND) at ECOSOC.  Post recommends favorable consideration, 
given Turkey's critical location along a main route for drug 
flows from Afghanistan.  Turkey is also one of only two 
countries in the world authorized legal opiate production. 
U.S. support would also help reinforce bilateral 
counternarcotics cooperation.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a March 28 diplomatic note, the Foreign Ministry 
requested U.S. support for Turkey's candidacy for re-election 
to ECOSOC's Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) for the 
2006-09 term.  In addition to sending the note, Ambassador 
Hayati Guven, MFA Director General for Security Affairs, 
raised the issue with the DCM.  The MFA offices that handle 
international organizations and narcotics have also made a 
point of requesting U.S. support.  The MFA officials told us 
they are concerned that, with six candidates from the WEOG 
group (Australia, Canada, England, Belgium, Spain and Turkey) 
but only five spots, Turkey is in danger of losing its place 
on the commission. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The GOT argues that it is a strong candidate for 
several reasons: 
 
--location along the principal route for egress of drugs from 
Afghanistan; 
 
--status as one of two countries authorized to produce 
opiates legally; 
 
--commitment to counter-narcotics demonstrated by its new 
status as a "Major Donor" at UNODC, having given $500,000 in 
each of the last two years; 
 
--decision to join the Paris Pact and host a conference later 
this year; 
 
--substantial resources devoted to TADOC, the regional 
training center located in Ankara at which over 1,000 foreign 
students have received training. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post suggests that Washington favorably consider 
Turkey's request.  With the recent surge of drugs from 
Afghanistan, it would send a bad message if Turkey were not 
to be re-elected to the CND, and particularly so if it is 
replaced by a country with a less central role in global 
narcotics issues.  US support for Turkey would also reinforce 
our excellent cooperation in counternarcotics.  The timing 
would be particularly good given the GOT's recent frustration 
of its candidacy for the Directorship of the Southeast 
European Cooperation Initiative (SECI).
