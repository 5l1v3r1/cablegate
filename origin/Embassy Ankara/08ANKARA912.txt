¶1.  (SBU) On May 7, the Government of Turkey announced a USD 1 
million pledge of humanitarian assistance to Burma to help alleviate 
suffering in the aftermath of tropical cyclone Nargis.  Turkey will 
work through the United Nations to make good on its assistance 
pledge.  The Turkish Disaster Management Agency (TAY) told us the 
GOT is in the process of finalizing a transfer of USD 500,000 to the 
UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and USD 
500,000 to the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF). 
 
¶2.  (U) In addition, the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC), an NGO with a 
mission similar to the American Red Cross, announced a pledge of USD 
600,000 in humanitarian assistance to Burma.  Assistance will be 
provided in the form of supplies which likely will include water, 
medicine and baby food.  However, distribution of relief supplies 
has been delayed by the lack of Burmese entry permits.  According to 
the TRC Foreign Relations Department, a four-person TRC evaluation 
team has been stuck at the airport in Jakarta, Indonesia since May 
8, awaiting permission from the Burmese government to enter the 
country. 
 
¶3.  (U) In addition to distributing humanitarian supplies, the TRC 
team plans to help restore a memorial dedicated to 1,500 Turkish 
POWs who died in Burma after being captured by British forces during 
World War I.  The memorial was damaged by tropical storm.
