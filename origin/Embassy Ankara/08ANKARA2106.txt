¶1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified. Not for internet 
distribution. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Econ counselor delivered reftel talking points 
December 11 to Babur Girgen, Head of the Afghan-Pakistan 
Department at MFA. Girgen said having a fixed date for the 
conference was the most important factor to ensure the 
participation of the Turkish Foreign Minister.  The Turkish 
Embassy in Washington had informed MFA early last week that 
the conference was being rescheduled to the week of January 
12, but on Friday December 5 reported that it was being 
postponed until February. The lack of a confirmed date makes 
it impossible to put the conference on the Minister's  travel 
schedule. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Girgen said the GOT has not yet decided whether it 
would make a pledge at the donors conference or what amount 
it might pledge.  No decision is likely until a conference 
date is set.
