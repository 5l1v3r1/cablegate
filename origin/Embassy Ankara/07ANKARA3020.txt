In Today's Papers 
 
Turkish Troops Launch Limited Cross Border Incursion into Iraq 
All papers report that yesterday approximately 700 Turkish troops 
crossed five kilometers into northern Iraq.  The operation came 
after receiving reports from US intelligence that the PKK terrorists 
were near the border area and were appeared to be planning to 
infiltrate into Turkey.  In a statement Tuesday, the Turkish General 
Staff (TGS) said a heavy blow was dealt on a group of terrorists 
trying to cross the Turkish-Iraqi border.  The statement also 
rejected news that "originated from north of Iraq" which argued that 
10 villages were bombed and a woman was killed.  "It is obvious that 
hundreds of civilians would have been killed if the villages had 
been targeted.  Such allegations only serve the terrorist PKK as the 
Turkish military demonstrated its affection for the people in north 
of Iraq in the past." 
 
Prime Minister Erdogan said the Turkish military would continue 
operations against the PKK.  "Our security forces will continue to 
do whatever is necessary," Erdogan told a news conference yesterday. 
 President Abdullah Gul, when discussing the cross-border 
operations, said "we did what was necessary...  We are targeting 
only the terrorist organization." 
 
The government of Iraq's Kurdish region condemned the cross-border 
incursion of Turkish troops.  "We condemn this incursion.  Turkey 
wants to transfer the PKK problem onto the territory of Iraqi 
Kurdistan," said Fuad Hussein, head of the office of Kurdish 
regional president Massoud Barzani.  Hussein stressed that the 
Peshmerge forces had been ordered to defend the sovereignty of the 
Kurdistan region and its people if the forces cause damage to the 
villages. 
 
Papers say the Kurdish region regional president Massoud Barzani 
cancelled his meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice in 
order to protest against the Turkish attacks on the Kurdish region. 
Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani told reporters "there was supposed 
to be a meeting between Rice and Barzani in Baghdad, but because of 
the US position regarding the Turkish attacks, he preferred not to 
go." 
 
Rice, speaking later at a news conference with Iraqi Foreign 
Minister Hoshyar Zebari, said "Turkey, Iraq and the US had a common 
interest in stopping the activities of the PKK."  Rice is also 
quoted as warning against actions which would destabilize the north 
of Iraq.  Zebari said his country understands the "legitimate 
security concerns of Turkey," emphasizing it would be better "if 
Iraq, Turkey and the US work together on a plan to eliminate the 
PKK." 
 
Papers also quote US Ambassador Ross Wilson as saying at a reception 
Tuesday that the US exerts all efforts to provide Turkey with 
"effective information" and "instant intelligence," He also 
emphasized that the intelligence sharing between the US and Turkey 
would continue. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkish Operations into northern Iraq 
Sami Kohen observed in the mainstream daily Milliyet: (12/19):  "The 
Turkish operation carried the risk of the opening a new front in the 
war in Iraq.  Despite this risk, the Bush administration made a 
difficult choice in the favor of Turkey.  American strategic 
interests played a part in Washington's decision-making mechanism 
because the US does not want to lose Turkey as an ally.  On the 
other hand, Washington does not want to see the emergence of a new 
conflict in northern Iraq.  Finally, Washington does not want to see 
anti-Americanism in the northern Iraqi administration or among Iraqi 
Kurds.  The surprise visit of Secretary Rice to Kirkuk and Baghdad 
is part of the US effort to maintain the delicate diplomatic 
balances.  It will be interesting to see the extent to which the US 
can control reaction from Baghdad and the regional Kurdish

administration.  Barzani's language indicates that he has returned 
to his harsh rhetoric.  Barzani, with Washington's persuasion, used 
to be moderate, but now he is playing tough.  I wonder if and when 
he is going to realize that good relations with Turkey are in his 
interest. " 
 
Gungor Mengi commented in mainstream daily Vatan (12/19): "Turkey's 
cross border operation has brought both military and political 
results.  However, given the current situation, political results 
are more important than military results.  The US used to suffer 
from a negative image in Turkey because Turks thought America 
pursued a deliberate policy to protect PKK camps in northern Iraq. 
In addition, the Armenian genocide resolution in the Congress caused 
a lot of negative reaction.  Finally, Turks felt Barzani's arrogance 
was fueled by US support for his administration.  Meanwhile, the US 
continued to suggest that Turkey solve the PKK problem through 
politicization, a suggestion which the Turks felt lacked common 
sense.  In fact, the US has turned a blind eye to the PKK for years. 
 Fortunately, the US administration realized its mistake.  Now 
Washington is acting with common sense and is illustrating zero 
tolerance against terrorism. With this attitude, we can hope for a 
secure and just future.  The more the US acts with common sense on 
this issue, the more the US will gain the hearts and minds of the 
Turkish people." 
 
Imam Counsels Assailant 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports Ramazan Bay, the youth who 
stabbed Roman Catholic Priest Adriano Franchini after the on Sunday 
mass in Izmir, fled to a nearby mosque after the attack.  The Imam 
of the mosque, after hearing Bay's confession that he regretted 
stabbing the priest, convinced him to hand himself over to police. 
On the other hand, Priest Franchini reportedly said the assailant 
Bay has psychological problems.  The paper says Bay has criminal 
records in police. 
 
Noted Pianist Warns against the Rise of Islam in Turkey 
Hurriyet, Vatan, Cumhuriyet and Radikal report world-famous Turkish 
pianist Fazil Say told a German daily last week, "Islamists have 
gained power in Turkey.  All the ministers' wives wear headscarves. 
We are a minority now, I might leave Turkey."  Say's remarks drew 
mixed reactions from the ruling AKP government members as well as 
intellectuals and the media.  Professor Turkan Saylan, the head of 
the Association for Supporting Modern Life, said they share the 
concerns of pianist Fazil Say about the rise of Islamism in Turkey. 
Several other intellectuals said Say revealed concerns shared by the 
whole country. 
 
Meanwhile, the Turkish Education Ministry filed a lawsuit seeking 
compensation from pianist Fazil Say, who sparked a heated 
controversy by saying that Islam was on the rise in Turkey, and that 
the AKP government was gradually lifting music and painting 
education in school.  Say had blamed the Education Ministry for 
blocking the appointment of new music teachers.
