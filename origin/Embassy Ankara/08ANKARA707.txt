REF: STATE 23568 
 
¶1.  (U) MFA Department Head for Nonproliferation and 
Disarmament Elif Ulgen told us on April 15 that her office, 
which is responsible for PSI and all nonproliferation 
matters, has proposed having newly-appointed MFA Deputy 
Undersecretary for Security Affairs Ecvet Tezcan lead the GOT 
delegation to attend the PSI fifth anniversary event in 
Washington (reftel). 
 
¶2.  (U) Ulgen noted that Tezcan just started in his new 
position this month, and there are still some administrative 
procedures required to confirm Tezcan's duties.  Ulgen said 
once these procedures have been completed, she will confirm 
the GOT's participation with event organizers.  Ulgen 
acknowledged our recommendation that participating countries 
register their delegation by April 21.
