SUBJECT: TURKEY TO SUBMIT FINAL CFE ENTITLEMENT TRANSFER 
MOU TEXT ON MARCH 30 
 
REF: A. ANKARA 681 
     ¶B. STATE 37715 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per ref a, we followed up with Ahmet Muhtar Gun, MFA 
Deputy Director General for Arms Control and Disarmament, on 
March 28 to underscore US acceptance of Turkey's changes to 
the CFE Entitlement Transfer MOU text and press for the 
exchange of final documents by March 30.  Gun said that the 
final text must be cleared by Deputy Foreign Minister Apakan, 
who is out of the country.  In preparation for his return, 
Gun has prepared a Note Verbale notifying the US of Turkey's 
acceptance of the final text, which he will present to Apakan 
on the 30th. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Recognizing the US desire to place the NATO IS 
document regarding the CFE transfer under silence procedure 
at the earliest date possible in order to ensure NATO 
approval by April 5, Gun pledged to send the Note Verbale 
containing Turkey's formal approval of the MOU text to the 
mission by noon local time on March 30.  If, he said, the US 
can be prepared at that time to submit to the MFA a Note 
Verbale agreeing to this final version of the text, Turkey 
will agree to the subsequent placement of the NATO IS 
document under silence procedure that same day. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Action Request: If Department agrees with this way 
forward, post requests Department provide approved text for a 
diplomatic note that responds to Turkey's note accepting the 
final, agreed CFE entitlement transfer MOU text.
