¶1.  Summary.  The Turkish Minister of Agriculture and Rural 
Affairs announced that tests from the recent outbreak 
confirmed the presence of the H5N1 strain of Avian Influenza 
in Turkey.  Samples had been sent to England earlier this 
week for testing.  The Minister of Health made a similar 
announcement confirming the results.  Both Ministers sought 
to assure the public that no new cases had been found and 
that all necessary precautions are being taken to contain 
the outbreak.  In addition, the government has increased the 
compensation fund for farmers.  End summary.

EU Announcement

¶2.  (U) The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Mehdi 
Eker, confirmed the presence of the H5N1 strain of Avian 
Influenza in Turkey and that it was the same strain that has 
killed more than 60 people in Asia.  The samples were sent 
to England for testing due to the lack of testing facilities 
in Turkey.  Initially, Turkish officials had confirmed that 
the virus was H5 type, but were unable to determine the 
exact subtype until tests were concluded.  Prior to the 
Minister's announcement, the European Commission's Health 
and Consumer Protection chief, Markos Kypriano, had made 
similar statements at a press conference.

No New Outbreaks 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Since the outbreak was first announced on October 9 
there have been no new incidents in Turkey.  In addition, 
there have been no reports of human deaths due to the 
outbreak.   The government quarantined the region around the 
outbreak and has taken precautionary steps to stop any 
inadvertent spread of the disease.  Several thousand birds 
have been culled in the region and the government is banning 
the sale of all live birds in public markets.  The 
government is testing any unusual deaths of wild or 
commercial flocks and would institute a similar quarantine 
if any other outbreaks occur.  The government announced that 
compensation fund for farmers had been increased to about 
USD 75,000 from USD 60,000.

Poultry Consumption Down 
------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Despite a very proactive campaign to both control 
the outbreak and provide information to the public, poultry 
consumption is down almost 75 percent since the outbreak. 
Egg consumption is also reportedly down. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) According to the head of the Turkish Poultry 
Producers, the EU had passed this information to the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs prior to making 
their announcement.  The Minister made his announcement 
after reporting the test results to the parliament.
