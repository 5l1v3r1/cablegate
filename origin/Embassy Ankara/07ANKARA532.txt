¶1. (SBU)  We presented reftel points and U.S. report to MFA 
Iran Desk Officer Aziz Sevi who provided us in return a copy 
of the Turkish status report to the UN on its compliance with 
UNSCR 1737 dated February 21 (faxed to ISN/RA).  The one-page 
Turkish report states that the MFA organized a number of 
coordination meetings with affected GOT agencies directing 
them to implement the resolution and that a legal process to 
incorporate the resolutions obligations had been initiated 
and was underway.

its translation of UNSCR 1737 and related references, and 
expects a Council of Ministers Decree implementing the
