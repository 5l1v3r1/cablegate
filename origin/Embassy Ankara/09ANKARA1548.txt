SUBJECT: TURKEY CAUTIOUSLY SUPPORTIVE OF WTO 
REMANUFACTURING INITIATIVE 
 
REF: STATE 107233 
 
¶1. We delivered reftel talking points and background 
information to Halit Akcaglayan, WTO Affairs Department Head 
at the Foreign Trade Undersecretariat.  Akcaglayan was 
already familiar with the issue and noted that Turkey has no 
problems in principle with the current proposed text and 
could support the initiative, although it may have some 
additional questions that it will route via the Turkish 
delegation in Geneva.  He was interested in the exact 
definition of the term "remanufactured goods," but agreed 
that this could be accomplished once the actual initiative 
got underway.  Akcaglayan noted that a delegation from Ankara 
would be heading to Geneva for various WTO committee meetings 
and he expected that they would also participate in the 
November 4 workshop on remanufacturing. 
 
¶2. Akcaglayan also conveyed an initial request for a 
bilateral meeting between State Minister for Foreign Trade 
Zafer Caglayan and the head of the U.S. delegation at the WTO 
ministerial in December (with the assumption that this would 
be USTR Kirk).  He noted that a formal request would be 
routed via official channels.
