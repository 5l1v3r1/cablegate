In Today's Papers 
 
Ambassador Wilson in Eskisehir 
Cumhuriyet, Sabah, Zaman, Aksam and others report that US Ambassador 
Ross Wilson visited Eskisehir yesterday.  He visited Eskisehir 
Governor Kadir Calisici, aviation industry facilities, and Anadolu 
University.  When responding to press at the Governor's office, the 
Ambassador said that "the US is aware of the difficulties and 
hardships caused by PKK terrorism.  We are working together with 
Turkey against terrorism.  Useful information has been given to 
Turkey for protection of its people.  The PKK has understood for the 
first time that they are not welcome either in northern Iraq or in 
Turkey.  They have enemies in the US, Europe and here."  Ambassador 
Wilson added that he "came to Eskisehir to further improve relations 
between Turkish and US universities and with business circles." 
 
Turkish Business Circles Determined to Continue EU Reforms 
Milliyet, Sabah, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, Radikal and others:  Mainstream 
Milliyet gave front-page coverage to criticism of the EU by Turkish 
business circles.  The President of the Turkish Industrialists and 
Businessmen's Association (TUSIAD), Arzuhan Dogan Yalcindag, 
criticized France's harsh stance against Turkey.  She said "the goal 
of EU politicians is to infuriate Turkey and make Turkey give up its 
efforts to join the EU.  We will be angry, but we will not give up 
on our path."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet says Turkey is 
preparing its response to the declaration to be released by EU 
leaders today in Brussels.  Before the approval of the declaration, 
Turkey plans to summon the Ambassadors of EU countries, including 
France, to the Foreign Ministry.  Cumhuriyet noted that if EU 
leaders approve the document in its current form, Turkish FM Babacan 
may boycott the EU's inter-governmental conference on December 18. 
This conference will open two new chapters in Turkey's EU accession 
process. 
 
EU-Turkish Relations 
Commenting on EU-Turkey relations, Sami Kohen wrote in mainstream 
daily Milliyet:  "As we approach the end of 2007, Turkey is entering 
a new period in its relations with the EU.  This period is marked by 
growing disappointment as negotiations continue with hardly any sign 
of improvement in 2008.  Given the fact that France will assume the 
presidency in the second half of 2008, we shouldn't expect any 
positive change in Turkey's application for membership to the EU 
during that time. While it is true that the attitudes of France and 
some others are the main reason for Turkey's disappointment in the 
EU process, we should also acknowledge that Turkey has made 
mistakes.  During 2007, both Turkey's public and government 
officials have lost their EU aspirations. Regardless of the motives 
or reasons, Turkey has distanced itself from the EU.  In turn, 
Turkey has shown a weak attitude when it comes to political reforms. 
 Both the government and the parliament started behaving in ways 
that reflect rising nationalist and religious movements throughout 
the country.  If we really want to get back on track, we should 
focus on new strategies.  The first step should be to appoint a 
ministerial post that is solely in charge of EU related issues. 
Second, Turkey should continue with its reform process in order to 
demonstrate a vigorous reform process.  We keep hearing from Turkish 
officials that reforms are for the benefit of the Turkish people and 
not solely because of the EU process.  This is a good time to act 
with this spirit." 
 
Okay Gonensin commented in mainstream daily Vatan: "Whether 
politicians or businesspeople, we have expressed our outrage at 
France's indignant attitude toward Turkey's EU accession process. 
Interestingly enough, we tend to believe that everything hinges on 
Sarkozy and his attitude.  Did we forget about the French Foreign 
Minister Kouchner, whom we like to call a friend of Turkey?   We are 
ignoring the fact that the EU mentions Turkey's 'limited progress' 
while it praises Croatia for its significant success. Turkey has 
done nothing significant in the last two years to bring itself up to 
EU standards.  The ruling AKP government should think about

reforming article 301 before getting mad at France.  The AKP has 
failed to fulfill its commitments and has demonstrated a significant 
lack of political will to continue the EU process.  Neither EU 
countries nor the Turkish public will take the European Union 
process seriously without the government's will to continue 
reforms." 
 
 
MHP Leader Devlet Bahceli's Remarks concerning DTP 
Milliyet, Sabah, Zaman, Hurriyet and others:  At a breakfast meeting 
with journalists, Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet 
Bahceli said that PM Erdogan and TGS Chief General Buyukanit should 
make a joint statement on terrorism for the people to understand 
where the government and the military agree and disagree on the 
issue."  Mainstream Sabah reports that Bahceli responded to AKP Vice 
Chairman Dengir Mir Firat's remarks that 'he had not seen the PKK in 
the parliament as the TGS chief implied," by saying "We can see the 
ones who had relations with the PKK in the past and who have 
continuing court cases on the issue, in the parliament.  They are 
sitting on our left."  Bahceli added that woman wearing the turban 
should be free to enter the universities and added some parties are 
using this issue as a 'political vitamin.' 
 
UN Seeks Information on Malatya Murder Case 
Milliyet reports that the UN Commission for 'religious tolerance' 
asked the Turkish Foreign Ministry to submit information and 
documents about last April's brutal murders of three Bible 
publishers in the southeastern city of Malatya.  The Dutch 
Protestant Church and Geneva Union of World Churches filed a 
complaint to the UN Commission on International Religious Freedom. 
The complaint alleges there is no religious freedom in Turkey. 
 
Armenian Journalist's Remarks on the Genocide Issue 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah and others:  Armenian-American journalist 
Harut Sasunyan said that the main goal of Armenians seeking 
recognition of their genocide claims is to obtain compensation and 
land from Turkey.  He urged Armenians to pursue legal actions in 
line with this goal.
