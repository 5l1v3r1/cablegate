¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) During the September 1 - 7, 2007 reporting period, no GOT 
security officials was killed or injured during clashes with PKK 
terrorists or in mine explosions. 
 
¶3. (U) In the same period, one PKK terrorist was killed in a clash 
with security forces, while three PKKers were captured and one 
surrendered. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported five clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists in Turkey's southeastern region during the 
reporting period.  Security forces discovered at least 11 PKK 
shelters/caves/caches and seized booby-trapped land mines; other 
explosives, including A-4 and TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; 
hand grenades; pistols; night vision binoculars; TV sets; satellite 
antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. The PKK detonated two IEDs on roads in Silopi, Sirnak Province 
and Cukurca, Hakkari Province on September 4 and 6, respectively. 
No casualties were cited in either of the incidents. 
 
¶6. (U) Activity as reported by TGS website (which includes:
