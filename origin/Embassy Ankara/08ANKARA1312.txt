SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT 
WEDNESDAY, JULY 23, 2008 
 
In Today's Papers 
 
Deliberation of AKP Closure Case Starts on July 28 
All papers report that the Constitutional Court will begin 
deliberation on the AKP closure case July 28th.  Mainstream Milliyet 
reports that the Constitutional Court President Hasim Kilic said it 
is not possible to give a date for the final decision, however, as 
always, when a decision is reached, they will inform the media. 
Milliyet observes that the AKP case has advanced much quicker than 
previous closure cases.  The AKP case looks to conclude after only 
4.5 months, whereas the Welfare Party (RP) case reached that stage 
at 8 months, and the Virtue Party (FP) in just over two years. 
Sabah says that the experts think the closure case may be concluded 
on August 1, or August 8 at the latest.   Islamist- oriented Zaman 
reports that the Constitutional Court members are scheduled to go to 
Russia on August 12, but the Court President Hasim Kilic said that 
"national problems have top priority, therefore, if necessary, the 
trip to Russia could be cancelled."  Mainstream Hurriyet says the 
suit will overshadow the High Military Council (YAS) on August 1-4. 
Liberal Radikal says there would be no problems in the appointment 
of new army commanders even if the AKP is banned because the 
appointments also can be made by the President or by an acting PM. 
 
High Tension at the Higher Education Board (YOK) 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet:  Today's papers 
report that the list of candidates for new rectors submitted by YOK 
to President Gul, did not contain names of highest vote getters at 
the relevant universities. (Note: the traditional practice is for 
university faculties to vote on candidates to establish a list of 
finalist candidates and those then are forwarded by YOK to the 
President for final selections.)  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet 
notes that all candidates opposing the government were eliminated by 
YOK.  President Gul will appoint rectors for 21 universities. 
 
Istanbul Court Rejects the Trial of Istanbul Police Chief in Dink 
Murder Case 
Sabah, Zaman, Radikal, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Bugun and others:  The 
Istanbul Regional Administrative Court rejected a request to 
prosecute eight policemen, including Istanbul Police Chief 
Celalettin Cerrah, for negligence in the Hrant Dink murder.  Earlier 
prosecution permission was granted for seven Istanbul police 
officials, but they appealed the decision to a higher court. 
 
President Gul Will Launch the Construction of New Railroad to 
Georgia and Azerbaijan 
Islamist-oriented Zaman reports that President Gul will go to Kars 
today to attend the groundbreaking ceremony for the 
Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway on July 24.  Georgian President 
Saakashvili and Azerbaijan's president Aliyev also will join the 
ceremony. 
 
 
Bosnian War Crimes Fugitive Arrested in Serbia.  Today's major 
international story focuses on the welcome of the arrest of former 
Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic who is accused of war crimes and 
genocide including Europe's worst massacre since World War II. 
Coverage is largely straightforward, but more emphasis is on the 
arrest being "a key step" for the country's EU membership hopes. 
Mainstream Hurriyet writes in "EU Diet of Serbians," that "the 
arrest of the Bosnia and Serebrenica monster will make Serbians 
attractive for the EU."  Liberal Radikal says former deputy 
Secretary of State Holbrooke described Karadzic as "the Osama Bin 
Laden of Europe, a real true architect of mass murder."  The paper 
also highlights that Karadzic was captured "once the newly elected, 
pro-EU government changed the national police chief." 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak carries the headline "Last Stop of the 
Serbian Butcher," noting "Turkey and the EU welcome Karadzic's 
arrest."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet writes the arrest is "a 
significant step forward on the way to EU."  Mainstream Vatan 
carries banner the headline "They Deliver the Butcher, They Join the 
 
ANKARA 00001312  002 OF 003 
 
 
EU."  Mainstream Milliyet portrays Karadzic as "a poet, a 
psychiatrist and a war criminal." 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: Serbia/Karadzic 
 
"They Captured Him, When They Really Wanted to" 
Sami Kohen wrote in mainstream Milliyet (7/23): "Despite a fugitive 
life in Serbia, for 13 years, Radovan Karadzic couldn't be found. 
In fact, there was no serious effort or desire to find him until now 
and the timing of his capture is rather meaningful.  Until now, the 
allied forces did not really want to go after him because they 
feared possible attacks from Serbian nationalists. And the Belgrade 
administration was not enthusiastic to go after Karadzic due to the 
potential for civil war because even now, Karadzic is still a heroic 
figure for some Serbians.  All of this helped the world's most 
wanted criminal enjoy a life in the middle of the capital city.  The 
capture of Karadzic came after a new administration took in charge 
in Belgrade.  It was the right timing in terms of both internal and 
international dynamics.  President Tadic and his coalition 
government expressed a determination to capture Karadzic and acted 
on it.  The new government wants integration with the EU and it was 
well aware of the fact that there wouldn't be any progress with the 
European Union unless Karadzic and Mladic were captured and brought 
to the justice." 
 
"The Bus Which Will Take Belgrade to the EU" 
Celil Sagir wrote in Islamist-leaning Zaman (7/23):  "The capture of 
Karadzic in a public bus raises questions, particularly about 
timing.  Serbia has been going through a power struggle between 
nationalist parties and a pro-Western bloc.  When the pro-Western 
bloc won recent elections, one of their priority targets was EU 
accession for the country.  Brussels and Belgrade signed a 
'Partnership and Stability Agreement,' but the capture of Karadzic 
and Mladic was a pre-condition to implement the agreement. 
Interestingly enough, the capture was announced on the eve of the EU 
Foreign Ministerial meeting to discuss the Union's relations with 
Belgrade.  Now, the EU's stance becomes very important.  If Brussels 
finds Karadzic's capture good enough to move forward with Belgrade's 
EU accession, then the possibility of capturing Mladic will weaken. 
However, both Karadzic and Mladic must be tried so that Bosnians can 
find relief from their pain from genocide." 
 
 
Roj TV in Trouble.  News outlets report in a straightforward fashion 
that Roj TV is in trouble for tax invasion.  Liberal Radikal writes 
in "Roj TV in Trouble with Europe," that "the Finance Ministry of 
Belgium is planning to seize their assets to compensate for a 4 
million Euro tax debt."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet writes "Roj 
TV is Stuck" saying "Belgium is after the Roj TV which was banned by 
Germany for being the PKK's propaganda mouthpiece."  Mainstream 
Sabah carries the headline "Roj TV Stuck in Belgium," while 
Islamist-oriented Zaman writes "Belgium Starts Confiscation of Roj 
TV."
