¶1.  (SBU) Econoff conveyed reftel talking points to MFA 
International Political Organizations Department Head Levent 
Sahinkaya, who replied that Turkey shared the U.S. goal to 
complete the revision of the International Health Regulations 
(IHR) at the May 12-13 meeting of the Intergovernmental 
Working Group in Geneva.  Sahinkaya said the issues raised by 
the U.S. did not appear to be controversial, and he was 
hopeful that suitable compromises would be reached.  However, 
on most issues, the Turkish delegation would align itself 
with the EU and seek to vote with the majority. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Sahinkaya said that he would convey the U.S. 
position to the Turkish delegation, which includes Mr. Kivanc 
from the Turkish Mission in Geneva and Dr. Yesir from the 
Ministry of Health, both of whom would be available to meet 
with U.S. officials in Geneva.  Sahinkaya added that the GOT 
had participated in the earlier working group meetings in 
November 2004 and February 2005 and was able at those 
meetings to resolve Turkey's concerns that the IHR 
(specifically, articles 20, 23 and 85) not contradict the 
Montreaux Convention.
