SUBJECT: TURKEY: AQ KHAN SANCTIONS REACTION, UPDATE ON CASE \

Classified By: Pol-Mil Counselor A.F. Godfrey, Reasons 1.4 (b,d) \
 \
¶1. (S) MFA Nonproliferation and Disarmament Department Head \
Elif Ulgen expressed appreciation for receiving advanced \
notification of US intentions to sanction individuals and \
companies linked with the AQ Khan network (reftel) and for \
the background information on the various sanctions.  We \
praised solid Turkish cooperation on these cases and \
emphasized that the sanctions are directed at the individuals \
and firms named, not the GOT. \
 \
¶2. (S) Ulgen said she did not anticipate much public reaction \
to the sanctions and noted that the individuals (Selim \
Alguadis and Kursad Cire) continue to be monitored by Turkish \
intelligence.  She agreed to check on the status of the \
plans, drawings, and documents that were in the Turkish \
companies' possession and follow up with us once she has \
additional information to share. \
 \
¶3. (S) Regarding Turkish efforts to prosecute Alguadis, Cire \
and others involved in AQ Khan network's activities in \
Turkey, including Urs Friedrich Tinner and Henk Slebos, Ulgen \
said the next hearing for the case will take place in March. \
She said that according to officials in the Ministry of \
Justice, the case cannot progress until Tinner, a key suspect \
in the case, either agrees to testify or provides a written \
deposition to the court.  She noted that the GOT still has \
not received any responses to its requests to the governments \
of Switzerland and the Netherlands for their assistance in \
obtaining a written deposition from Tinner and Slebos, \
respectively.  While making clear the GOT is not in position \
to influence the judicial process, Ulgen expressed concern \
that the court may eventually dismiss the case if the GOT is \
unable to obtain the needed cooperation from other \
governments. \
 \
¶4. (S) Comment: The GOT has worked hard to investigate and \
prosecute those involved in the AQ Khan network here and has \
worked closely with the USG in this case.  The MFA is \
frustrated that it has not been able to obtain needed \
information from foreign governments.  MFA officials are \
aware of the New York Times reporting alleging a connection \
between the Tinner family and US government agencies. \
Although they have not explicitly stated so, it is clear MFA \
officials following the case do not expect a response from \
the Swiss Government and suspect the USG has played a role in \
this.  Absent a deposition from Urs Friedrich Tinner, it is \
highly likely the case against Alguadis and Cire will \
eventually be dismissed. \
