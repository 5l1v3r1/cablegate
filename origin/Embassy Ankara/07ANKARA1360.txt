Buyukanit: Turkish Troop Movements on Iraq Border Routine
All papers report the Turkish General Staff (TGS) chief General
Yasar Buyukanit told a
symposium at the War Academy in Istanbul that he had already drawn
the government´s attention to the need for launching a cross-border
operation into northern Iraq, adding there is no need to submit to
the government a written request for political authorization.
Buyukanit emphasized that the aim for any operation must be clear.

"The target should be set by political authorities; are we just
going to go in and fight the PKK or will there be something with
Barzani as well?" Buyukanit said, pointing out that "the US is in
the middle of it all" as well. The Turkish troop buildup on the
border with Iraq is "routine spring planning," Buyukanit said,
adding no new troops have been sent to the region.

Commenting on the US transfer of security in northern Iraq to the
regional Kurdish administration, Buyukanit said "There is no Shiite
security authority in the Shiite region or a Sunni authority in the
Sunni region, like the Kurdish one in northern Iraq. This special
status is drawing attention, and it is not appropriate."
With regard to the recent violation of Turkish airspace by US F-16
jetfighters, Buyukanit said Americans didn´t need to send F-16s to
monitor Turkish movements on the border, since they can take
pictures from satellites. "The violation by F-16s, however, is not
appropriate," Buyukanit stressed.

The army chief also said countries providing logistics, financial
and propaganda support to terrorists should also be considered
terrorists. "Landmines and explosives such as C-4, A-3, and A-4
which are used in every murder in Turkey are not bought from
supermarkets" Buyukanit said, criticizing "the countries among
Turkey´s allies" that directly or indirectly support the PKK.
Editorial Commentary on Buyukanit Remarks
Mustafa Unal commented in the Islamist-leaning daily Zaman: "There
is no military operation which can be announced beforehand. However
the Turkish public has been discussing a possible military operation
for days. Given the fact that terrorist elements will be warned by
this public discussion, I wonder what the real purpose of the debate
is. Can this be a part of internal political tactics? It looks to
me like General Buyukanit´s recent remarks are a maneuver to corner
the AKP government vis-´-vis Turkish public opinion."
Fikret Bila observed in the mainstream daily Milliyet: "General
Buyukanit gave some very important messages when he talked about the
importance of clearly defined targets in northern Iraq should the
Turkish army start a cross border operation. The Chief of General
Staff emphasized that every military operation has political
targets, and noted that in northern Iraq there is not only the PKK
but also Barzani, and the US in the middle of it all. His comments
centered on three major points: What is the Turkish government´s
goal in northern Iraq? Can Barzani be considered one of the targets
besides the PKK? What is the Turkish government´s position on the
US presence in northern Iraq?"

Turkish Parliament Approves Constitutional Reforms

All papers report theTurkish Parliament on Thursday overriding an
earlier veto from President Sezer, approved for a second time a
controversial package of constitutional reforms that pave the way
for voters to elect the president directly. The package now will be
returned to Sezer who cannot veto it a second time, but can call a
referendum. The reforms cut the term of the president´s mandate to
five years renewable for a second term, and also reduce parliament´s
term to four years from five. The main opposition CHP is expected
to challenge the amendments in the Constitutional Court, claiming
that the adoption is invalid unless approved by a two-thirds
majority of 367 votes. The provision reducing parliament´s term to
four years was approved by 366 votes, falling short by one vote.

Kissinger in Istanbul

Sabah, Milliyet, Radikal, and others: Speaking at a conference in
Istanbul, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger called on the
international community to cooperate with the US to end the war in
Iraq. Kissinger added that it is Turkey´s right to take necessary
measures against the possible problems at the Iraqi border; however,
these measures should be acceptable to the international community.
Kissinger said that the US understands Turkish sensitivity on the
issue but will not welcome a cross border operation into Iraq by
Turkey. On the issue of Turkey´s EU membership, Kissinger said that
being part of the European system is very important for Turkey,
however, if this process fails, the US should start a close
partnership with Turkey.

Controversy over Prayers in Public High School

Hurriyet, Milliyet, Bugun, Zaman and others: Istanbul education
director Ata Ozer defended the high school students praying in a
prayer room in the basement of the high school saying "there is
freedom of worship and conscience in Turkey." Mainstream Hurriyet
reports that Bagcilar district prosecutor in Istanbul has initiated
an investigation into the incident. Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak
and Zaman question the public reaction to the incident asking in
front page stories "Is it a crime to pray?"
