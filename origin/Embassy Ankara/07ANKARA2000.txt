SUBJECT: USTR GSP DIRECTOR DISCUSSES TURKEY'S PARTICIPATION AT 
EXPORT SEMINARS 
 
REF: A) Ankara 1017 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  As discussed at the April U.S.-Turkey Trade and 
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) Council meeting (reftel), USTR 
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Program Executive Director 
Marideth Sandler visited Turkey during the week of July 9 to discuss 
Turkey's participation in the program with Turkish exporters in 
Istanbul, Izmir, Bursa, Gaziantep and Ankara.  During the seminars, 
Sandler stressed the importance of communication with U.S. importers 
to ensure that paperwork is filled out properly so that Turkey's 
benefits under the program are fully utilized.  In addition, she 
provided exporters with lists of eligible products and provided 
valuable information for exporters wishing to expand or take 
advantage of the duty free exports provided under the program. 
Sandler's week-long visit was praised by Turkish Foreign Trade (FTU) 
officials, who organized her program, and was considered by all as 
another positive step towards expanding our bilateral trade 
dialogue.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During her July 9 - 13 visit to Turkey, USTR GSP Executive 
Director Marideth Sandler met with Turkish exporters in Istanbul, 
Gaziantep, Bursa, Izmir, and Ankara to discuss how Turkey can better 
utilize its benefits under the program.  Sandler also met separately 
with representatives from the gold jewelry, silk textiles and 
traditional Turkish rug producing sectors.  Turkish exporters' 
greatest concern is was whether or not Turkey will be able to retain 
its benefits under the program after the Congressionally-mandated 
statutory review in 2008.  Sandler gave no guarantees but provided 
information on how Turkish exporters can currently best utilize 
Turkey's benefits under the existing program.  In addition, 
exporters of such products as Turkish travertine (marble) tile and 
home improvement material and traditional Turkish textile garments 
and apparel expressed their hope that their products would either be 
included again or for the first time, a desire that Sandler 
explained is very difficult to meet due to the requirement for 
Congressional action for any changes to the existing benefits. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Sandler focused her seminars on the categories of goods 
for which GSP benefits are available to Turkey and the proper 
procedure for completing the required paperwork in order to fully 
utilize the program.  She stressed the importance of communicating 
with U.S. importers to ensure they correctly complete their Customs 
declarations in order for the goods to enter the U.S. duty-free. 
She also answered questions posed by the exporters about the 
program. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  Sandler's seminars gleaned positive results by 
opening direct communication with Turkish businesspeople and 
debunking many of the myths surrounding the GSP program.  She was 
well-received and provided a wealth of information that will no 
doubt help expand our bilateral trade relations.  End comment. 
 
¶5. Ms. Sandler cleared this cable.
