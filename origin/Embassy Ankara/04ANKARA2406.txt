MFA NATO Head of Department Alper Coskun told PolMilOff April 
28 that no Turkish officials had been designated to attend 
the Wilton Park Conference on Missile Defense.  Coskun 
thought lack of funding might have been a factor.  PolMilOff 
encouraged the GOT to contact the Wilton Park organizers 
regarding financial assistance; Coskun said he would look 
into the possibility.  PolMilOff noted that Turkey had been 
identified as a key player in the issue of missile defense 
and the USG thus hoped for Turkish participation.
