¶1.  (SBU) A/DCM delivered ref a points to Turkish MFA 
Multilateral Affairs DG Polat July 11, stressing the need to 
move forward on a wide range of UN reforms and avoid a 
divisive debate over UNSC membership.  Polat said Turkey 
supports the Italy/Pakistan/Mexico group's opposition to the 
G-4 plan, adding that enlargement should be just one piece of 
overall UN reform.  Polat worried that African Union support 
could help the G-4 proposal reach 128 votes needed for 
adoption. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Polat asked about the U.S. position on German and 
Indian bids to be permanent UNSC members.  We reiterated ref 
B point that apart from support for Japan's bid for a 
permanent seat, the U.S. has made no further decisions on who 
else should or should not be added to the UNSC.
