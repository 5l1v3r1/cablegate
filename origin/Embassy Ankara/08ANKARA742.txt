In Today's Papers 
 
PACE Releases Declaration on AKP Closure Case 
All papers reported over the weekend the Parliamentary Assembly of 
the Council of Europe (PACE) released a declaration which expressed 
concern about the closure suit against Turkey's ruling party, the 
AKP.  The PACE statement, however, has caused controversy since last 
Wednesday, when Luis Maria Puig, the head of PACE, told the press 
the Turkish delegation, led by the ruling AKP, demanded a statement 
condemning the case.  The AKP denied such charges, but the 
opposition CHP attacked the government for seeking international 
support in what was an internal matter.  The declaration signed by 
the leaders of the Christian Democrat, Socialist, Liberal and United 
European Left groups in PACE urges Turkey to pass reforms to protect 
political parties from closure.  The declaration says, "It is 
unacceptable to close down political parties who are not linked to 
violence."  Islamist-oriented Zaman sees it as a "powerful message" 
for Turkey because the declaration was signed by all political 
groups represented in PACE.  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet, 
however, recalls on Saturday, "The declaration was released after 
the request from AKP officials."  Mainstream Hurriyet however notes 
on Saturday that, "The declaration, signed by only 21 of the 370 
members of PACE, did not meet the expectations of the AKP who 
allegedly requested it."  Papers say the declaration also emphasizes 
the importance of respecting the independence of the judiciary. 
 
European Parliament to Vote on "Turkey Report" 
All papers report the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign 
Affairs will vote on the "Turkey Report" drafted by PACE reporter 
Ria Oomen-Ruijten.  The report urges the Turkish government and the 
parliament to carry out, "as a priority," the promised reform of 
Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code.  The report expresses concern 
about the lawsuit banning the AKP and calls on the Constitutional 
Court to comply with European standards and the Venice Criteria. 
The report encourages Turkish authorities to pursue investigations 
into the Ergenekon network in order to "fully uncover the shadowy 
organization's networks which reach into the state structures, and 
to bring those involved to justice."  In addition, the report, 
"urges the Turkish government to launch, as a matter of priority, a 
political initiative towards a lasting settlement to the Kurdish 
issue," and calls on the pro-Kurdish DTP "to engage constructively 
in the quest for a political solution to the Kurdish issue within 
the democratic Turkish state."  It urges the PKK to unconditionally 
lay down its arms.  On Cyprus, the report says, "the withdrawal of 
Turkish forces would facilitate the negotiation of a settlement." 
 
Justice Committee of Turkish Parliament Approves Changes to Article 
301 
Papers report over the weekend the Turkish Parliament's Justice 
Committee approved changes to Article 301 of the penal code on 
Friday.  According to the Committee's recommendations, the authority 
to permit the launch of legal procedures related to Article 301 
should reside with the Justice Ministry, and not to the President as 
initially expected.  Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code 
criminalizes insulting "Turkishness."  Under the changes proposed by 
the government, the term "Turkishness" will be replaced by the 
"Turkish nation."  The bill lowers the maximum punishment from three 
to two years, which opens the way for the postponement of the prison 
term of those convicted under Article 301. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Revision of Penal Code Article 301 
 
"Article 301 and the Government" 
Oktay Eksi wrote in mainstream Hurriyet (4/20): "If it were not for 
the AKP closure case, changes to Article 301 would not be on the 
agenda.  Prior to the closure case, the government was completely 
reluctant to change this notorious law.  Thanks to the EU, the 
changes are now on the agenda.  The sad part of this story is that 
this mistake was corrected despite the government.  Turkish NGOs 
have worked tirelessly to encourage the government to expand

legislation to protect freedoms and human rights.  While the 
government did not take action based on Turks' suggestions, the 
government did take action based on the EU's suggestions.  Our wish 
is to see Turkey move forward on matters related to freedom and 
democracy through its own impetus before facing international 
pressure.  When and if that happens, we will give the government a 
standing ovation." 
 
Turkish Cabinet to Discuss May 1 as Official Holiday 
Milliyet, Sabah, and Radikal report Turkey's Council of Ministers 
will decide Monday whether to declare May 1 as an official holiday. 
Last week, AKP lawmaker Agah Kafkas submitted a bill to parliament 
to declare May 1 as "Unity and Solidarity Day."  Labor Minister 
Faruk Celik said several labor unions asked Prime Minister Erdogan 
to declare May 1 an official holiday. 
 
PKK Terrorist Captured in Diyarbakir 
All papers report police captured a PKK terrorist and two suspected 
accomplices in Diyarbakir.  The suspects were allegedly preparing 
for bomb attacks in the mainly Kurdish southeastern city.  A 
statement from the Governor's Office said the main suspect was 
trained in PKK camps outside Turkey.  Police seized 451 grams of 
plastic explosives, hand grenade fuses, four laptops, and three 
mobile phones. 
 
Meanwhile, four PKK members and one Turkish soldier were killed in 
clashes in Kagizman on the eastern border province of Kars. 
 
 
Editorial Commentary on Global Food Crisis 
 
"Power, Energy and the Future" 
Soli Ozel wrote in mainstream Sabah (4/20): "Given the nature and 
frequent number of disasters, the world appears headed toward an 
apocalyptic period.  This global food crisis comes with potentially 
grave consequences.  It is possible this time that the global food 
crisis will be more devastating than ever before.  In addition, the 
world population is heavily condensed in the cities instead of rural 
areas.  In the event of a crisis, population density plus a lack of 
an educated populace in these cities could lead to more violence. 
It is also incorrect to assume a food crisis will only affect less 
developed nations.  Indeed, a crisis of this scale will create mass 
migration, which will be enough to create a global security issue. 
Food and energy are the main sources of upcoming global problems, 
including potential wars.  Changing the course of such a disaster 
requires massive change in consumption habits across the world."
