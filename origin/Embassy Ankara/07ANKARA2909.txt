In Today's Papers 
 
Calik Group Offers $1.1 Billion for ATV-Sabah 
Today's papers report that Calik Group was the sole bidder in 
yesterday's auction for the ATV-Sabah media group.  Calik submitted 
a $1.1 billion offer to Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (TMSF) for 
the media group which includes the second rated television station 
in the country, a top circulation daily as well as several other 
paper and magazine publications.  Milliyet highlights that the 
auction lasted only five minutes.  Cumhuriyet says that Berat 
Albayrak, the son-in-law of PM Erdogan, is a General Manager at the 
Calik Group.  The Samsun-Ceyhan pipe line project was also given to 
the Calik group earlier without any bid.  The company manager's 
family ties with the government are causing speculation among 
opposition parties.  CHP leader Deniz Baykal said that "this 
government is creating its own media."  Milliyet reports that at the 
tender, the bidder was asked to raise the initial price, but the 
Calik Group refused to do so.  The offer will be submitted to the 
fund's board for approval tomorrow. 
 
PKK, Northern Iraq, DTP 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Cumhuriyet and others report that security 
operations on Gabar Mountain continue.  Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
announced that eight more terrorists were killed yesterday.  Sabah, 
Yeni Safak and Zaman quote US State Department Spokesman Tom Casey 
saying "Turkey does not need permission from the US" for military 
operations that stem from its national security concerns. 
 
Meanwhile, answering journalists' questions in Athens, Foreign 
Minister Babacan said that "Barzani and the Kurdish Administration 
have not taken concrete steps to work with Turkey to eliminate the 
PKK", reported Sabah, Hurriyet, Radikal. 
 
Milliyet adds that, during the budget talks at the parliament, DTP 
Mus Parliamentary Deputy Sirri Sakik said that the PKK is a reality 
for Turkey and AKP deputies reacted to him, "you are remaining a 
spectator to the terrorists". 
 
Ahmedinejad Refers to US Report as Victory for Iran 
All papers widely cover the US Intelligence report released Monday, 
which concluded that Iran stopped its nuclear weapons program in 
late 2003 and has shown no signs since of resuming it.  Cumhuriyet 
and Milliyet said that Iranian President Ahmedinejad highlighted the 
report as a victory against the superpower.  Sabah reports Secretary 
Rice's comments on the issue that "the report does not erase the 
danger" posed by Iran. 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: Iran 
 
"End of Iran the Crisis?" 
Sami Kohen commented in mainstream daily Milliyet: "The NIE report 
on Iran's nuclear program provides key information that contradicts 
President Bush's statements on the issue.  The report's conclusion, 
namely that Iran's nuclear weapons program ceased in 2003, caused 
political tremors around the world, including in Washington.  The 
gist of the issue is whether Iran has fully given up on its nuclear 
weapons program.  Given the current circumstances, Iran cannot 
resume its weapons program because such a measure would validate the 
Bush administration's claims against Iran.  Even though President 
Bush expressed that Iran continues to be a threat, he seems to have 
lost the argument.  Bush claims that Iraq had weapons of mass 
destruction were used to start the Iraq war.  Such weapons have not 
been found.   Because of the NIE report, Iran is acquitted.  The 
issue is a serious debate in the US, and Democrats are urging the 
administration to revise its Iran strategy.  Given the current 
picture, it's unlikely that Iran will cause a third world war." 
 
"Relief" 
Soli Ozel commented in the mainstream daily Sabah: "The NIE report 
provides significant information that invalidates claims about Iran 
 
ANKARA 00002909  002 OF 002 
 
 
made by the Bush administration and Israel.  It also indicates that 
diplomatic measures and embargoes have actually worked on Iran. 
Following the NIE report, it is almost impossible for either the 
Bush administration or Israel to launch a military operation against 
Iran.  It looks as if American intelligence rushed to prepare such a 
report in order to prevent VP Cheney from dragging the whole country 
into another adventure.  With or without an optimistic perspective, 
the possibility for a strike against Iran has weakened.  This fact 
alone offers some relief.  In any case, developments in the region 
call for a continued close monitoring."
