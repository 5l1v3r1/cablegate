SUBJECT: TURKISH PETROLEUM CONFERENCE TARGETS UPSTREAM INVESTMENT IN 
IRAQ, IRAN AND SYRIA 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  The purpose of Turkish Petroleum's "Northern 
Arabian Plate Oil and Gas Summit" (NAPOGS 2008) October 8-10 was to 
share information about ongoing or planned upstream development in 
Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey.  The conference targeted 
participation of energy ministers and national oil companies; and 
also included international oil companies such as BP, Shell, RWE and 
GDF.  MFA Energy Department Head Berris Ekinci downplayed the 
significance of Arab energy ministers gathering in Turkey and 
pointed out that US and EU diplomats were invited but unable to 
attend.  Turkish Energy Minister Guler, Iraqi Oil Minister 
Al-Shahristani and Iranian Deputy Oil Minister Seyyed Reza 
Kasaeizadeh were the highest ranking officials in attendance.  Syria 
was represented at a lower level.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to Turkish Petroleum (TPAO) Acting Department 
Head for International Relations Murat Karci, the Northern Arabian 
Plate Oil and Gas Summit (NAPOGS 2008) aims to establish an 
information sharing platform for the upstream companies operating or 
planning investment in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey.  The summit has two 
components: the conference - to which energy ministers, government 
officials, academicians and representatives of the oil and gas 
sector will attend; and the exhibition - which will highlight the 
equipment and services of companies doing business in the region. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MFA Energy Department Head Berris Ekinci downplayed the 
significance of this gathering of Arab energy ministers and claimed 
it was not the first of its kind, although she was unable to name 
the first one.  She also said the summit included national as well 
as international oil companies and foreign diplomats were invited 
although unable to attend.  EU Commission Economic Counselor in 
Ankara Ulrike Hauer confirmed that EU Ambassador Mark Perini had 
been invited and opted not to go because the summit seemed like 
"just another oil and gas conference in Turkey."  EUR Deputy 
Assistant Secretary Matt Bryza also said that he was invited but 
unable to attend due to scheduling conflicts. 
 
¶4.  (U) The conference agenda focuses on oil and gas source 
countries, specifically tax and regulatory regimes and the degree to 
which private sector investment is welcomed.  There is also an 
emphasis on regional cooperation for the sake of increased security 
of supply, and on strengthened relations among the neighboring 
countries. There is a session on transportation focusing on the role 
of the Arab Gas Pipeline for bringing gas to Europe. 
 
¶5.  (U) The conference has separate panels for Iran, Iraq, Syria and 
Turkey.  In the session on Iran, one of the topics of discussion is 
whether Iran can take the lead in a possible "Gas OPEC." Other 
topics include the LNG potential and the impact of service 
agreements on foreign investments.  The session on Iraq focuses on 
the hydrocarbon law, the procedures for exploration and production 
licenses, and the potential of new reserves.  The session on Syria 
addresses issues like the impact of PSAs on encouraging exploration 
activities in new fields, Syria's increased gas needs and the 
possible connection of the Arab Gas Pipeline to the Turkish grid. 
The session on Turkey focuses on Turkey's increased gas needs and 
possible sources to meet this need, Turkey's role as an energy 
bridge between the Middle East and Europe, LNG opportunities in the 
region, and the effect of market liberalization on the use of new 
energy resources. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment: Having been left off the initial list of 
prequalified companies to compete for oil and gas licenses in Iraq, 
TPAO's real aim in organizing this conference may be to gain the 
confidence of the Iraqi Oil Minister by showcasing Turkey's upstream 
capabilities to him directly.
