In Today's Papers 
 
Unrest in the AKP: One Deputy Expelled, Another Sent to 
Disciplinary Committee 
All papers:  The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) 
yesterday expelled Hatay Deputy Fuat Gecen from the party 
and referred Afyonkarahisar Deputy Mahmut Kocak to the joint 
Disciplinary Committee with a demand for his expulsion. 
Fuat Gecen was expelled from the party after making 
allegations of irregularities in state tenders in Hatay, on 
the grounds that he insulted, defamed, and humiliated the 
AKP, its members and leaders.  Mahmut Kocak was sent to the 
disciplinary board after he criticized Prime Minister 
Erdogan.  Kocak had accused the Prime Minister for reacting 
impulsively when anything annoying happens by saying that 
'though the Prime Minister may have been raised in Kasimpasa 
(a rough Istanbul neighborhood), he should not always act in 
line with that culture under tension. 
 
Vatan reports that in order to eliminate the escalating 
tensions in the parliament, a group of parliamentarians 
established a "Dialog Group."  Five Deputies from AKP, four 
from CHP, one from ANAP and one independent deputy 
established this group without informing their party 
leaders.  The group had their first meeting with PM Erdogan 
and Parliament spokesman Arinc yesterday. 
 
CHP Leader Baykal's Emergency Plan of Action for the 
Government 
Radikal, Aksam:  Main opposition Republican People's Party 
(CHP) leader Deniz Baykal tabled seven requirements for the 
government to overcome the current political crisis.  CHP's 
suggestions to the government are as follows:  The Ministers 
of Education, Finance and Interior, and the Prime Ministry 
Undersecretary Omer Dincer should be removed from their 
posts immediately; the anti-terror bill should be passed by 
parliament before the summer recess; the AKP must call early 
polls or agree to seek consensus in Parliament for next 
year's presidential elections; and the AKP should not 
interfere with military appointments made by the High 
Military Council. 
 
Germany to Establish Official Contact with "TRNC" 
All papers report following Britain and the United States, 
Germany now will establish official contacts with 
"President" Mehmet Ali Talat, with Foreign Minister Frank- 
Walter Steinmeier to meet with the Turkish Cypriot leader in 
Berlin on Friday.  Commentators note that the meeting would 
not amount to recognition of the "TRNC," but was important 
since Talat would be recognized as the elected leader of 
Turkish Cypriots, underlining that it would constitute a 
serious message for President Papadopoulos that the 
uncompromising policies of Nicosia could lead to the 
recognition of "TRNC."  Papers claim the meeting was 
organized by Cuneyd Zapsu, a close advisor of Prime Minister 
Erdogan. 
 
Mass Grave Found in South Cyprus 
Sabah reports that on June 2 Greek Cypriots discovered human 
remains in a mass grave. The remains are thought to be those 
of Turkish Cypriots who went missing during clashes on the 
island in 1963 and 1964. This is the first known case of a 
Turkish Cypriot multiple grave being found on the Greek 
Cypriot side of the island since Cyprus was partitioned 
after Turkey's invasion of the north in 1974.  Missing 
persons is a highly-charged issue between Greek and Turkish 
Cypriots on the island with 1,500 Greek Cypriots and 800 
Turkish Cypriots unaccounted for.

US Report: 90 Nukes Kept in Incirlik Airbase 
Hurriyet reports the main opposition CHP is to submit to 
parliament today a motion with regard to a report drafted by 
the US-based National Resources Defense Council which 
claimed the US has 90 B-61 nuclear bombs in Incirlik Airbase 
in southern Turkey.  American F-16 C/D planes to carry the 
nukes are kept in underground shelters in the base.  CHP 
lawmaker Sukru Elekdag said the Cold War was over, and 
recalled Greece had taken nuclear bombs out of the country. 
Elekdag noted that it would not be possible for Turkey to 
explain to Muslim and Arab countries why the bombs were kept 
in the country. 
 
Magden to be Tried for Supporting Conscientious Objection 
Milliyet, Sabah, Vatan, Radikal, Cumhuriyet:  Author Perihan 
Magden will appear before court in Istanbul today in a 
lawsuit filed against her for supporting conscientious 
objection against compulsory military service in Turkey. 
Turkish General Staff (TGS) had filed a complaint with the 
prosecutor's office in Istanbul against Magden for defending 
in a weekly magazine article in December the right to 
conscientious objection.  Several international and domestic 
observers are expected to monitor the hearing today. 
 
Editorial Comments: Haditha, US and the Geneva Convention 
 
Commenting in Dunya, Zafer Atay writes that Haditha was not 
an isolated incident: "It only reminds one of other major 
massacres by the US forces in South Korea in 1950 and in 
South Vietnam in 1968.  The British press has already called 
Haditha the tip of the iceberg.  And this statement reflects 
the truth if we remember other killings committed by the US 
forces in Iraq such as in Tal Afar, Fallujah and Ishaqi. 
The fact is that the US is committing massacres in Iraq 
after entering into the country on the pretext of democracy 
and freedom.  A dynasty of the cruel prevails in today's 
Iraq." 
 
Ibrahim Karagul argues in Yeni Safak that the US decision to 
"unilaterally suspend the Geneva Convention for Prisoners of 
War," as reported to by the Los Angeles Times, means there 
will be "absolutely no international guarantee for POWs." 
Karagul concludes, "By suspending the Geneva Convention 
unilaterally, the US added another crime against humanity 
because this move only justifies unilateral massacre and 
genocide by the US forces.  The US is forming a new world 
shaped by its war doctrine where individual rights and 
freedoms are eliminated."
