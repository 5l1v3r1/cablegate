BRIEFING 
 
 
Cyprus:  "Milliyet" reports that Turkish  Parliament Speaker 
Bulent Arinc has invited Denktas to speak to the Parliament 
on April 15.  Some papers interpret this invitation as an 
effort to balance Prime Minister Erdogan's recent comments 
about Denktas.  "Milliyet" notes that this could be a 
farewell speech for Denktas if he opts to resign following 
the April 24 referendum.  "Cumhuriyet" claims that Denktas 
believes the Turkish government was not given all the 
details of the Annan plan, and that Erdogan was `deceived' 
on the Cyprus issue.  "Turkiye' reports Erdogan's response 
to Denktas' remarks.  Speaking during an official visit in 
Japan, Erdogan said that `these are ugly remarks, and I have 
not been deceived'.  "Milliyet" notes that in the wake of 
Greek Cypriot pressure for delaying the referendum, Turkey 
urgently requested UN support for holding the referenda as 
scheduled. 
 
 
Iraq:  Most papers report that despite the cease-fire, 
tension continues in Fallujah.  "Sabah" reports that 600 
Iraqis, most of them civilians, had been killed in Fallujah 
as revenge for 4 Americans who were murdered and mutilated 
there ten days ago.  "Yeni Safak" claims in a banner front- 
page headline that President Bush is `walking in the 
footsteps of Hitler.'  The paper cites the British `Daily 
Telegraph' as its source, and notes a British commander 
criticizing US soldiers for a `shoot first, ask questions 
later' approach in Iraq. 
 
 
 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION 
 
 
"Turkish Cypriots must say `Yes'" 
Cengiz Candar observed in the mass appeal "DB-Tercuman" 
(4/13):  "If both sides in Cyprus accept the Annan Plan in 
the April 24 referenda, the `United Republic of Cyprus' with 
Turkish Cypriots as equal political partners will join the 
EU. .  In an effort to guarantee the Greek Cypriots' 
`Republic of Cyprus' membership in the European Union on May 
1 (i.e., without the Turks), AKEL has asked for a 
postponement of the April 24 referenda.  This means that 
AKEL prefers to see the Turkish Cypriots as a minority 
rather than an equal political partner.  AKEL is openly 
pursuing a nationalist policy in a leftist disguise. .  No 
matter how narrow their vision may be, Greeks Cypriots' 
opposition to the Annan Plan is understandable.  The Turks' 
national interests require acceptance of the plan. . 
Turkish nationalists' opposition to the UN-sponsored plan 
will only legitimize the Greeks' vision for a `Republic of 
Cyprus.' .  The Turkish Government must convince the EU and 
the US to openly warn the Greek Cypriots that if the plan is 
accepted by the Turks and rejected in Southern Cyprus, 
international sanctions against the Turkish Cypriots will be 
removed immediately.  The Greek Cypriots must be told that 
Turkish Cyprus will be given a special status until the 
Greek side accepts the plan.  It must also be declared that 
if the Greek Cypriots reject the plan, the referendum will 
be repeated only on the Greek side of the island." 
 
 
"Dangerous game" 
Hasan Cemal commented in the mass appeal "Milliyet" (4/13): 
"Diplomatic sources in Ankara say that the postponement of 
the April 24 referenda would be against the roadmap laid out 
in the Annan Plan. .  It is the Greek Cypriots who are 
really against the plan.  They do not want a new state, but 
prefer to include the Turks as a minority within their 
existing state, according to Ankara.  The European Union 
erred in announcing its acceptance of Cyprus' membership in 
the EU even though no solution has been reached. .  AKEL's 
intention to oppose the Annan Plan has disappointed those 
who support the plan in the Turkish sector, because a `no' 
vote in the south will leave northern Cyprus outside the EU 
even if the Turkish Cypriots accept the UN blueprint. . 
Turkish Cypriot politicians think that AKEL is playing a 
dangerous game.  The UN, US and EU must see the trick for 
what it is and take action immediately.  Such blackmail by 
the Greek Cypriots will not only divide Cyprus, but will 
jeopardize peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean 
and Aegean."
