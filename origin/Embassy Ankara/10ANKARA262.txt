Media Highlights 
 
US Embassy Ankara-Turkey Media Reaction, as prepared by the Public 
Affairs Information Office 
 
How the US is Playing 
 
Armenian Genocide Resolution (AGR) Tensions with the US Ambassador 
(Zaman) 
Media outlets report extensively on Ambassador Jeffrey's interaction 
with members of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee on 2/16, 
emphasizing that the "US gives full support to the normalization 
process between Turkey and Armenia," and, regarding the AGR, that 
"Congress is an independent institution, we do not know the final 
outcome."  Like most media, Milliyet in its front page story reports 
 that CHP and MHP members of the committee criticized the US for 
bringing Armenian genocide drafts to the agenda every April and 
exerting pressure on Turkey, saying that the AGR was hanging as a 
"Damocles' sword" over Turkey.  "We told the Ambassador that 
Turkey-US ties could suffer a great blow if the bill on the events 
of 1915 was adopted by the House of Representatives," Murat Mercan, 
head of the Turkish parliament's foreign relations committee told 
reporters.  In "Veiled Threats from Jeffrey," Cumhuriyet notes that 
Jeffrey commented:  "As President Obama told PM Erdogan on December 
7, the best way out is the approval of normalization protocols with 
Armenia." The paper also reports that opposition MHP lawmaker Deniz 
Bolukbasi reacted strongly to Ambassador Jeffrey, saying the US 
Ambassador's remarks constituted a "veiled threat."  In "Cold Shower 
for US at Foreign Relations Committee," mainstream Vatan reports 
Jeffrey said he also wished the bill wouldn't be adopted.  "We have 
been giving the same message to Armenia," said Jeffrey, stressing 
that the best way would be the continuation of the normalization 
process between the two countries."  All papers note that the 
Ambassador agreed to pass the committee's views back to Washington. 
 
Security Training Confession from the US Consulate (Sabah) 
Mainstream Sabah reports that the US Consulate in Istanbul has 
confirmed the allegations of Saadet Party (SP) leader Prof. Dr. 
Numan Kurtulmus regarding security training given to religious 
minorities.   US Consul-General Sharon Wiener said that the 
Consulate was responding positively to occasional security 
consultancy requests from organizations with American employees or 
visitors and that the informal consultancy service was launched in 
2004, following terror attacks on the British Consulate, HSBC bank 
and a synagogue in Istanbul.   She added that the training was given 
to some religious groups, schools, hotels, private companies and 
Turkish governmental organizations that were visited by US citizens. 
 She noted that the goal of the consultancy service was to increase 
security perceptions in areas visited by Americans, to improve ties 
between security officials and to improve the capacity of these 
organizations to cope with terror threats.   Also, the training was 
related only to defensive issues, and did not include any practices 
with arms. 
 
Secretary Clinton: "Missile Shield Will Protect Turkey as Well" 
(Hurriyet) 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports that during her visit to Qatar, 
Secretary Clinton gave an interview to al-Jazeerah TV and responded 
to a question on missile shield by saying, "The missile shield will 
provide a right defense for Turkey and the Caucasus region and will 
provide an additional guarantee against any threatening stance.  We 
are discussing the details with our friends in the Gulf, including 
what else will be needed from a defense angle, in case Iran pursues 
its nuclear goals."  Hurriyet adds that the US changed its mind 
about establishing a missile defense system in Eastern Europe, and 
instead, has decided to sail its specially equipped war ships into 
the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. 
 
In the Headlines 
 
"Four Critical Messages to Iran" (Sabah) 
 
ANKARA 00000262  002 OF 003 
 
 
Turkish media report that FM Davutoglu asked Iran during a visit 
there on 2/16 to suspend its uranium enrichment program for a while 
in order to "reduce already heightened tensions."  Mainstream Sabah 
reports that Turkey put forward new proposals "which can facilitate 
breaking the deadlock" and summarized Davutoglu's four critical 
messages as "The fate of the region is in Iran's hands.  The Arab 
world is worried while the Western world is getting tougher.  Iran 
should take steps to reduce tension.  Postpone the uranium 
enrichment program for a while."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet 
highlights Iranian FM calling Turkey "a consultant to Iran." 
Mainstream HaberTurk notes Davutoglu "conveyed the Western world's 
messages to Tehran" while Islamist and pro-government Zaman 
characterizes the efforts as "Nuclear Diplomacy in Tehran."  All 
papers quote Iranian FM as saying "we consider Turkey to be a good 
friend and a good adviser.  We also believe Turkey can help us in 
making the world understand better about Iran's peaceful nuclear 
program."  Columnist Soli Ozel in mainstream HaberTurk underscores 
that Turkey is in a diplomacy effort "even though it does not have 
direct control of its dynamics."  Given the current situation, "it 
is entirely up to Iran's attitude" says the writer, concluding: "If 
Iran chooses not to change then it will face serious consequences 
that are completely out of Turkey's control." 
 
At the Turkish parliament on 2/16, Ambassador Jeffrey responded to 
questions related to FM Davutoglu's talks in Tehran.  Ambassador 
Jeffrey outlined ongoing consultations between the US and Turkish 
diplomats but recalled that Iran had yet to give a satisfactory or 
concrete answer to the offer made by the UN Security Council. 
"Hopefully, an answer will come thanks to mediation by Mr. 
Davutoglu," said Jeffrey.

insult and threats against individuals."
