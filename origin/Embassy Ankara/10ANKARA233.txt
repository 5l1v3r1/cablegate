REF: SECSTATE 12558 
 
¶1. (U) MFA UN Affairs Department Head Turhan Dilmac told us 
that Turkey's offer to send a formed police unit to Haiti 
(ref a) is formal and said Turkey's UN Mission has 
instructions to convey this to UNDPKO.  Dilmac noted that the 
mission is a challenging one, but underscored Turkey's firm 
commitment to send a unit of between 120 to 150 police 
personnel to Haiti.  He said two specialists from the Turkish 
National Police (TNP) are planning to head to Haiti in the 
near term to determine the area where the Turkish unit will 
be deployed -- in consultation with the UN -- and to conduct 
a survey of that area.  He said Turkey's UN Mission will 
coordinate with the UN on the travel of the specialists to 
Haiti.  The specialists' mission is to make a security 
assessment of the area and provide recommendations on the 
equipment and capabilities the Turkish unit would need for 
the mission.  Dilmac stressed that the length of deployment 
has not be decided and can only be determined following the 
experts' assessment.  He also mentioned that there may be an 
agreement needed between the Government of Turkey and UNDPKO 
in order to finalize arrangements for the FPU's deployment, 
and said Turkey's UN Mission is working with UNDPKO on this 
agreement. 
 
¶2. (U) Dilmac said it would be premature to speculate on when 
the Turkish FPU may be able to deploy or its equipment needs 
at this point; the GoT will have to wait for its experts' 
assessment before making these decisions.  He also said 
issues related to transportation logistics for the unit's 
deployment has not been specifically discussed yet.  Dilmac 
did not indicate any requests at this point for assistance 
with the unit's deployment. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶3. (U) Turkey delivered humanitarian aid in the immediate 
aftermath of the earthquake using five Turkish Air Force 
C-130s.  Although the MFA did not state this, we expect 
Turkey will be able to employ its C-130s to transport the 
police unit to Haiti.
