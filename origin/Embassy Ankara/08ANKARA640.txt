In Today's Papers 
 
The Enigma of Europe's Terrorist List 
All papers report on the European Court's decision to exclude the 
PKK from the EU's list of designated terrorist organizations. 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports that the European Court of 
Justice ruled on a case submitted by Osman Ocalan that appealed for 
the PKK's removal from the EU's terrorist list.  The court decided 
the 2002 ruling, in which the PKK was added to the list of terrorist 
organizations, was wrong because, "the PKK organization was not 
given the right to defend itself."  Papers report that the EU 
Council declared that the EU Court decision will not have any impact 
on the EU's list of terrorist organizations. 
 
Mainstream Sabah says both the AKP and opposition parties reacted by 
saying that such decisions do not comply with the principles of 
fighting against terrorism.  Far right Tercuman writes, "Turkey 
abides by all EU demands, but the EU took another step toward 
dismembering Turkey," and the paper called the ruling, 
"treacherous."  Mainstream Aksam writes in its banner headline, 
"This is European Justice," and notes, "The PKK is removed from 
Europe's list of terror organizations."  Mainstream Milliyet's 
headline reads, "Ankara is Shocked by the European Court of 
Justice's Ruling," but the article notes, "the ruling was only 
related to procedural flaws."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet calls 
the European terror list, "a mystery."  However, Islamist-oriented 
Zaman notes, "The EU's Opposition Emerges to the Decision Against 
the European Court; The PKK is a Terrorist Organization," as EU 
Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesperson said, "the EU 
accepts that the PKK is a terrorist organization."  Meanwhile, DTP 
Batman deputy Bengi Yildiz said, "this decision is a positive 
development; law should speak rather than guns." 
 
Strong Messages from PM Erdogan to the EU 
All papers: During his address to the Turkey-Sweden Business Forum 
in Stockholm, PM Erdogan called on the EU to be clear about Turkey's 
membership.  Erdogan reiterated Turkey's determined efforts towards 
EU reforms, but noted that Turkey's patience is not endless. 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak's banner headline carries Prime Minster 
Erdogan's message to the EU during his meetings in Sweden, "If You 
Will Not Take Us, Don't Delay Us," noting the PM said, "Turkey is 
tired of the EU saying 'but,' 'however,' and 'if.'" Yeni Safak and 
Zaman both carry Erdogan's statement, "We are really tired of this. 
If EU countries openly say they do not want us, we will be able to 
focus on solving our own problems." 
 
NATO Summit's Scorecard of Victories 
Sabah, Milliyet, Vatan, Aksam, and others:  Mainstream Sabah's 
headline reads like a scorecard, "NATO: 2 - Bush: 1." The paper 
notes President Bush did not find support for his combat troop 
request for Afghanistan and the countries he supported for NATO 
membership, Ukraine and Georgia, were not accepted as members. 
However, President Bush gained NATO approval for the installation of 
a U.S.-led missile defense shield throughout Europe. 
 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet writes under the headline, "A 
Threatening Wave Strikes the Summit," that "Bush made a call that 
smelled like a threat concerning more troops in Afghanistan" while 
Russian President Putin, "warned of a deep crisis if Ukraine and 
Georgia joined NATO," but that "Germany and France vetoed the new 
members."  In addition, the paper notes, "Turkey, Greece and 
Bulgaria will join the NATO missile defense program against 
short-range missiles," but that "Putin is coming to the summit today 
and his response to the missile defense expansion is awaited with 
anxiety."  Islamist-oriented Zaman writes about the German and 
French vetoes against the membership of Ukraine and Georgia in 
"Putin's Victory," that "in this case, Moscow used its energy power 
as a successful tool of foreign policy." Liberal Radikal calls the 
vetoes against Ukraine, Georgia, and Macedonia, a "Victory for 
Moscow and Athens," as "NATO took note of Russia's red line," and 
 
ANKARA 00000640  002 OF 003 
 
 
"Greek pressure prevented Macedonia's membership."  Leftist Taraf 
writes, "Bush Didn't Get Anything He Wanted," as "in response to his 
demands for more troops in Afghanistan, only Paris and Prague agreed 
to support him," and "Ukraine, Georgia and Macedonia's memberships 
were blocked." 
 
Europe Reacts to the AKP Closure Case 
Mainstream Milliyet reports that co-chairman of the Turkey-EU joint 
parliamentary commission Joost Lagendijk spoke during a meeting 
regarding Turkey's EU accession negotiations.  Lagendik said, "The 
closure of the AKP should be prevented and the government should 
prepare an extensive reform package that prevents the closure of the 
political parties."  EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said, 
"the suit filed against the AKP was against the Venice Criteria 
because the relevant criteria justify party closure only if there is 
violence involved." 
 
The PKK's Internal Turmoil 
Milliyet, Zaman:  Papers report turmoil within the highest ranks of 
the PKK.  PKK leader Abdulkerim Ertas was killed recently during 
clashes with the Turkish military in the Bestler-Dereler region. 
According to reports based on wiretaps of PKK radio communications, 
PKK members are accusing leader Fehman Huseyin (code name Dr. 
Bahroz) for leading Ertas and PKK fighters into the deadly 
Bestler-Dereler clashes. 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION:  NATO 
 
"Putin's NATO Victory" 
Faruk Akkan wrote in Islamist-leaning Zaman (4/4): "By blocking 
Ukraine and Georgia's membership to NATO, Russian President Putin 
claimed an historic victory.  He has worked hard to prevent NATO's 
extension toward the heart of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS); with this victory he also ensured Russian military presence 
in the Black Sea. All of this comes as a result of the Kremlin's 
long-term strategic planning, including its effective use of 
security and energy influence.  Putin's trump card was the 
possibility of a hot conflict in the Caucasus region if NATO 
expanded toward Ukraine and Georgia; he used this as a threat to 
Europe's oil supply routes.  A crisis in that region is the last 
thing NATO needs.  Speculations continue regarding Putin's 
concessions in exchange for blocking NATO's expansion.  Russia may 
allow its territory to be used for Afghanistan operations; military 
bases in the CIS countries may also contribute.  During the 
Bush-Putin summit, the two leaders are expected to sign a bilateral 
strategic agreement regarding short and mid term goals regarding 
this." 
 
"Bush and Afghanistan" 
Haluk Ulman wrote in business daily Dunya (4/4): "The NATO summit 
proves George Bush is focusing heavily on international issues 
before his presidential term comes to an end.  Afghanistan appears 
to be the prime concern for the Bush administration.  In fact, 
Afghanistan has become a benchmark for success for NATO in its fight 
against Al-Qaeda; developments in Afghanistan will shape the future 
of the Alliance.  Therefore President Bush urged NATO members to be 
more engaged in the ongoing efforts by sending combat troops to 
Afghanistan.  NATO will gain enormous credibility if NATO defeats 
the Taliban and Al-Qaeda; but also, Kabul's full authority must be 
reestablished throughout the country.  Otherwise, NATO may lose its 
'raison d'etre,' particularly in this post-Soviet Union era.  If 
NATO loses the struggle with the Taliban, nobody will take the 
Alliance seriously.  There is, however, no consensus among NATO 
members regarding the nature of commitment for Afghanistan.  Bush 
pursued his 'use of force' policy in Iraq, which ended with a 
complete failure.  Even NATO's Secretary General, in 2006, said, 'a 
military solution would not be the best option for Afghanistan. 
Afghanistan needs economic development, education and 
infrastructure."

Final Court Ruling Against Saudi Businessman on the UN Terrorism 
Financers List 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Cumhuriyet and Radikal report the final ruling 
by Turkey's Danistay (High Court of Appeals for Administrative 
Affairs) on the status of Saudi businessman Yasin al-Qadi's 
financial assets in Turkey.  When his name was added to the UN's 
terrorism financers list on September 28, 2001, al-Qadi's financial 
assets in Turkey were frozen.  Following a series of appeals by 
al-Qadi's lawyers to overturn the ruling against him, the Danistay 
issued its final decision yesterday that his assets will remain 
frozen.
