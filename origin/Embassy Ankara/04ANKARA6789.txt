SUBJECT:  RESPONSE FROM KAPTANOGLU SHIPPING COMPANY 
 
Ref:  (A) State 258406 (B) Ankara 6764 
 
Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please Handle Accordingly. 
 
¶1. (U) In two faxes sent December 3, Tansel Karademir, 
Operations Manager of H. Ismail Kaptanoglu Ship 
Management and Trading company, responded to Embassy's 
demarche to MFA warning of Coast Guard security concerns 
and possible action against the shipping company. 
Karademir wrote that the company had not previously been 
aware of the September 30 Coast Guard warning letter, 
and that it is doing its best to be responsive to the 
security problems raised in that letter.  Karademir 
stated that the company is working on a detailed 
response, which will be ready sometime during the week 
of December 6, and offered to meet with U.S. officials 
in Ankara or in Washington on this.  Embassy has faxed a 
copy of the letter to EB/TRA/OTP and EUR/SE.  We 
suggested that Karademir get in touch with Lt. Commander 
Michael Cunningham, the point of contact listed in the 
September 30 letter. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Econoff contacted Basat Ozturk, head of the MFA 
Maritime Department, on December 6 to thank him for his 
intervention with Kaptanoglu.  Ozturk told us that he 
had ensured that senior officials at both MFA and the 
Maritime Undersecretariat, as well as the company 
itself, were informed of the seriousness of the security 
problem.  He urged Washington agencies to give 
Kaptanoglu the opportunity to respond before deciding on 
any further sanctions against the company. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Embassy understand that Washington agencies are 
scheduled to discuss this case via conference call 
December 7.  As in ref B, Embassy suggests giving the 
company an additional week to address Coast Guard 
concerns prior to imposing additional sanctions.
