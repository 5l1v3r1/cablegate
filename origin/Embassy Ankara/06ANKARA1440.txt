     ¶B. ANKARA 180 
 
¶1.  The Government of Turkey held a planning conference on 
March 15, 2006 in Ankara for the upcoming PSI exercise 
Anatolian Sun.  (Originally named Anatolian Deer, in late 
January the name was change to Anatolian Sun; TGS tells us 
this was to better match the operating area and objectives of 
the exercise, but we understand the Turkish translations of 
"deer" was judged as conveying too light a tone.)  Attending 
the conference were representatives from United States 
(EUCOM, NAVEur) and France, as well as a large interagency 
Turkish delegation.  Portugal was invited to the conference 
but was not able to attend.  Participating countries reviewed 
the exercise scenario  and suggested changes to provide 
additional training opportunities for the units involved and 
to increase the opportunities for greater joint activities. 
The Turkish hosts accepted these changes. 
 
¶2.  MFA Disarmament and Arms Control Department First 
Secretary Sehan Yigit reviewed the status of the responses 
 
SIPDIS 
from the 59 nations invited to the PSI exercise during a 
meeting on March 17.  Yigit stated that Turkey has received 
responses from 38 countries; of these 27 nations responding 
that they will attend the exercise, 3 of those (United 
States, France, Portugal) committed to provide assets, 
although Yigit noted that he was informed that 
representatives from Portugal have inquired about what 
difficulties would arise if Portugal could no longer provide 
assets to the exercise.  11 nations have responded 
negatively.  The GOT is still awaiting responses from 21 
countries.  Yigit noted that the Turkish Embassy in the 
non-responsive countries will be asked to assist in getting a 
reply. 
 
¶3.  The current breakdown of responses to Anatolian Sun is: 
 
a.  Participating: Albania Austria, Australia, Azerbaijan, 
Belgium, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland,

Note: Libya has requested more information including details 
of what other countries were invited.  Turkmenistan, 
Kazakhastan, Kyrgystan have all requested additional 
information and are reconsidering their replies.  Yigit 
expressed appreciation for US efforts to get these countries 
involved.  He was aware that the US had been in contact with 
these countries since they requested information with the new 
exercise name, Anatolian Sun, which had not been formally 
announce to them yet. End note. 
 
¶4.  Comment: The GOT views this exercise as an opportunity to 
demonstrate both to their own public and the international 
community the efforts that Turkey is taking to stop the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The Turkish 
General Staff has had the lead in developing the exercise, 
and has successfully incorporated input from other ministries 
in the Turkish government including Customs, Turkish Atomic 
Energy Authority, Interior Ministry and others.  The GOT is 
hoping that the leadership displayed in coordinating this 
exercise will assist them in solidifying its leadership role 
in PSI.  Turkish officials also hope to raise public 
awareness about nonproliferation and has, therefore, built 
into the exercise significant media events.  End Comment.
