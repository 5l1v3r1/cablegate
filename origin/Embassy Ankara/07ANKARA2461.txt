In Today's Papers 
 
Party Leaders Speak Out on Terror 
All papers report that political party leaders spoke out at their 
party group meetings in the parliament Tuesday.  Opposition CHP 
leader Deniz Baykal, recalling a recent terrorist attack in the 
southeastern province of Sirnak that claimed the lives of 12 
civilians and yesterday's blast in the Aegean city of Izmir killing 
one and injuring 11 people, said terror in Turkey continued at full 
speed.  Baykal said the recent counter-terror agreement signed 
between Turkey and Iraq was a "comedy."  He said, "We made a grave 
mistake during those negotiations, and asked to use the hot pursuit 
right which does not require the consent of any country, and which 
was granted to Turkey by the UN with Iraq's consent.  Although it's 
clear that Iraq is not keen on taking measures against PKK 
terrorism, our government still relies on them."  Baykal also 
recalled Iran's bombing of northern Iraq against terrorists, 
underlining the inaction of Iraqi authorities against the Iranian 
attacks.  The CHP leader also opposed education in languages of 
Turkey's ethnic groups, saying that would be like "planting a bomb 
under Turkey's unity." 
 
Far right MHP leader Devlet Bahceli called on the parliament to 
authorize the Turkish military's right of hot pursuit into northern 
Iraq. 
 
Ahmet Turk, leader of the Pro-Kurdish DTP, said in reply to Turkish 
General Staff (TGS) chief Yasar Buyukanit's recent speech calling 
for "measures" against the DTP for refusing to declare the PKK a 
terror organization, that "Buyukanit is targeting both the DTP and 
the parliament."  Turk also said Prime Minister Erdogan's statements 
that Turkey's Kurds were not a minority but rather a part of the 
majority were similar to the statements of the PKK's imprisoned 
leader Abdullah Ocalan.  "If we are given guarantees, attempts could 
be made to see the PKK lay down its arms in two months," Turk said. 
 
 
Meanwhile, liberal Radikal quotes President Abdullah Gul as saying 
en route to Strasbourg yesterday, "Everybody should openly reject 
terror.  A new period has commenced, and everybody has come to the 
parliament.  It would be a pity to harm this development." 
 
Gul on EU Reforms, Article 301, Terrorism 
All papers report that on Tuesday, President Abdullah Gul spoke with 
reporters aboard his plane en route to Strasbourg where he will 
visit the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) in 
his first trip abroad.  Gul stressed that Turkey needs a stronger 
focus on EU reforms.  "Reforms can be fast or slow, but the 
important thing is that the trend is positive.  The government will 
carry out the necessary steps with regard to Turkey's membership in 
the EU, and I will act as a leader of the effort," Gul said.  Gul 
noted that Turkish enthusiasm for EU reforms has declined in 
reaction to the negative attitude of Europe.  Gul also acknowledged 
that penal code article 301, making it a crime to "insult 
Turkishness," was one of the shortcomings in Turkey's EU drive, but 
expressed confidence that the parliament will raise the 
controversial provision.  Gul emphasized that in the "new period" 
Turkey has entered, people would be able to express even the most 
radical views.  He warned against attempts to harm this new period, 
urging all to distance themselves from terrorism and violence. 
 
Bombs Kill 1, Injure 11 in Izmir 
All papers report that two bombs exploded in Izmir yesterday with a 
three-and-a-half hour interval.  The first bomb exploded near a 
garbage bin and the second was planted on a stolen motorbike.  One 
person died and 11 were injured.  Police believe that the bombs were 
planted by the PKK terrorist organization. 
 
Armenian Genocide Resolution (AGR) in US Congress 
Sabah, Milliyet, Radikal, Zaman:  Islamist oriented Zaman's 
 
ANKARA 00002461  002 OF 003 
 
 
Washington correspondent reports that the AGR will be on the US 
Congress' agenda on October 10.  Mainstream Milliyet and Sabah 
highlighted the fact that the countdown started at the Congress on 
the Armenian resolution and that PM Erdogan and President Gul are 
considering calling President Bush separately to ask his support and 
initiative to prevent proceeding of the AGR in the Congress. 
Liberal Radikal says that the resolution first will be debated at 
the Foreign Relations Committee of the US Congress on October 10 and 
the following week it will be carried to the full commission. 
 
Sami Kohen comments in the mainstream daily Milliyet: "It seems the 
Armenian Genocide Resolution will be taken up by the US Congress 
next week.  Due to strong efforts by Nancy Pelosi, it is almost 
certain that the resolution will pass in the House.  The only hope, 
though very dim, is that the resolution may be re-edited or put on 
hold at the very last minute.  In fact the supporters of this 
resolution are facing pressure from outside, including from the 
administration as well as from the State Department.   The very 
latest example was the joint letter to Pelosi signed by eight former 
Secretaries of State against the passage of a resolution.  Even 
 
SIPDIS 
though it did not get very much attention in the Turkish media, this 
letter alone is a very important development as US Secretaries of 
State of both Republican and Democrat administrations have clearly 
demonstrated a common stance and reminded the House of the 
consequences of passing the resolution.   The members of the House 
have to make a choice between their domestic concerns, such as 
Armenian-American votes, and the importance of America's ally as a 
regional player." 
 
Editorial Commentary on US-Turkey Relations and the Fight against 
the PKK 
Yilmaz Oztuna observes in the conservative daily Turkiye: "The 
recent meeting between the Turkish Foreign Minister and the US 
Secretary of State was like an insensitive joke.  Regarding Turkey's 
 
SIPDIS 
fully justified cause on the PKK, Secretary Rice mentioned to 
Minister Babacan that the US has been combating the PKK in Northern 
Iraq and now wants to finish this up by extending the struggle 
against the PKK throughout the world.  Given her good diplomatic 
skills, her remarks can only be regarded as a joke.  Yet she has to 
realize that Turks cannot tolerate jokes on such a sensitive matter. 
 Turkey, on the other hand, will very soon regret signing a security 
agreement with Iraq which basically ruled out the hot pursuit option 
against the PKK in Iraq.  The Interior Minister of Iraq who signed 
the agreement is nothing more than a puppet of Barzani as well as 
the US.  Overall, the US continues to bear a grudge against Turkey 
because of the rejection of the March 1 [2003] parliamentary motion, 
and in return, asks Turkey to accept its Iran policy with no 
objections.  Otherwise, the US hints, the Kurdish issue and the 
Armenian issue will be used against Turkey.  The sooner we realize 
that the better."
