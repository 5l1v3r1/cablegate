     ¶B. BAGHDAD 3891 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Iraqi Ambassador in Turkey delivered ref a 
request to the Turkish Foreign Ministry during the morning 
hours of December 15.  MFA officials told us that the GOI 
note, together with the U.S. request to extend the validity 
of agreements regarding support to OIF through Turkey, was 
sent immediately to the Foreign Minister.  The MFA explained 
that the next step is for a formal letter from Foreign 
Minister Babacan to be sent to the Prime Minister, requesting 
a Council of Ministers Decree extending the validity of the 
agreements.  According to the MFA, the formal letter had been 
drafted in anticipation of receiving the Iraqi request, and 
should move forward very quickly.  MFA officials would not 
speculate as to when the Council of Ministers Decree would be 
complete, but expressed confidence that the agreements 
would/would be extended before the end of the year. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During an evening meeting on December 15, the 
Ambassador raised the Incirlik Cargo Hub Agreement with MFA 
Undersecretary Ertegrul Apakan and asked that the request for 
extension be given urgent attention.  Apakan recognized the 
importance of the support for Iraq's transformation provided 
through Turkey and said that the MFA was very satisfied with 
the text of the Iraqi note.  This issue has the attention of 
the highest levels of the Turkish government.  We will 
continue to ensure it remains a top priority.
