SUBJECT: URGENT DEMARCHE ON US SECURITY COUNCIL'S 
RESOLUTION ON LEBANON-TURKEY 
 
REF: STATE 132517 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action message.  See para 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador spoke August 12 with Turkish MFA U/S 
Tuygan to convey reftel demarche regarding UNSCR 1701.  In 
addition to the points provided, Ambassador urged Turkey to 
express strong support for the resolution.  He expected that 
work will now accelerate quickly to mobilize the additional 
international forces envisioned.  He noted the general 
US-Turkey discussions that have taken place on the issue and 
said it will become urgent in coming days to deal with 
specifics. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Tuygan replied that Turkey is very pleased with the 
resolution and with the fact that it passed unanimously.  He 
is finalizing with FM Gul a public statement that will be 
issued shortly expressing that support.  The priority for 
Turkey is implementing the resolution and doing so as quickly 
as possible in order to bring the hostilities to an end and 
establish a permanent cease-fire.  He did not comment further 
on a Turkish role in the international force, but PM 
Erdogan's positive remarks on the subject were noted. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Ambassador separately went over the same points with 
Deputy U/S for the Middle East Uzumcu.  Ambassador has a 
previously existing appointment with Uzumcu on Monday 
morning, August 14, and the two agreed to discuss further 
issues related to the expanded international force for 
Lebanon. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Action: Post would appreciate by our OOB Monday, 
August 14 any guidance that may be available regarding the 
international force and what we wish specifically to ask of 
Turkey, including any planning meeting, etc.
