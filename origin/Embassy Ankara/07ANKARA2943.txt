SUBJECT: EXBS: TURKEY ADVISOR'S MONTHLY REPORT- (NOVEMBER 
2007) 
 
 
¶1. Summary:  The EXBS Advisor completed transfer of the 
Z-Backscatter Van (ZBV) to Turkish 
Customs.  Turkish MFA continues to withhold implementation of 
EXBS Agreement pending U.S. ratification of the Peaceful Uses 
of Nuclear Energy (123) Agreement.  Progress continues for 
ongoing enforcement training and equipment deliveries. 
 
¶2. Completed Actions for the Reporting Period 
 
¶A. Site Assessment and Meetings During Recent Reporting Period 
 
1)  Nov 1 - EXBS Advisor and Coordinator inspected AS&E 
Z-Backscatter van.  The van was properly stored and 
maintained by warehouse staff and is ready for delivery to 
Turkish Customs Enforcement upon acceptance and signature of 
U.S. Property Grant documents. 
 
2)  Nov 6 - Met w/ Mr. Mehmet Guzel, Turkish Customs, Deputy 
Director General for Enforcement and his Head of Department 
for Enforcement, Mr. Ender Gurleyik for a general overview of 
Turkish Customs organization.  Customs Enforcement is working 
closely with U.S. (EXBS) and EU assistance programs to 
build an umbrella of detection and enforcement capabilities. 
These include 5 additional fixed and 1 mobile X-ray units at 
key customs ports with Iran, Syria, and sea ports in the 
Mediterranean and Black Sea, as well as enforcement detection 
tools, and replacement of existing U.S.-provided portal 
radiation detection monitors with locally-built TAEK portal 
monitors and U.S.-acquired SLD systems (when approved by 
GOT). 
 
3)  Nov 7 - Met w/ Mr. Ihsan Kocer, Undersecretariat of 
Customs, Deputy Director General for EU and External Affairs 
and his Head of Section for Training and EU Accession 
Harmonization to review the CBP draft report on Turkish 
Customs Academy training programs.  EXBS Advisor recommended 
further discussions on working with DHS/CBP on the next phase 
of this curriculum review using DHS/CBP trainers in Turkey to 
update their current training curriculum.  Turkish Customs is 
also receiving additional assistance for capacity building 
for customs personnel and organizational development from 
Germany, as 
well as assistance from Italy to develop a forensics 
laboratory in Istanbul which will include a drug 
analysis capability for the Istanbul / Marmara Region. 
 
4) Nov 26 - Met w/ Mr. Ender Gurleyik again to follow-up with 
Customs Enforcement on issues relating to delivery of 
Z-Backscatter van and clearance of new CT-30 Kits and Gerber 
Tool kits.  Customs is ready to receive the van and is 
requesting Embassy and TAEK assistance for clearance of CT-30 
Kits, since they contain a radiation source inside the Buster 
Density units.  Dip note was sent to MFA requesting TAEK and 
Customs work together for licensing of Busters and clearance 
of CT-30 and Gerber kits. 
 
5) Dec 7 & 8 - Brett Golden, EXBS Program Manager for Turkey 
visited Ankara and met with Turkish officials from Turkish 
Atomic Energy Agency (TAEK), Undersecretariats of Ministry of 
Foreign Trade, Customs and Foreign Affairs, and Turkish 
National Police.  TAEK proposed sending US experts to Turkey 
to conduct a nuclear smuggling threat assessment with TAEK, 
which EXBS can use as a vehicle to encourage TAEK support for 
future EXBS and SLD initiatives.  The MFA welcomed news that 
the PUNE Agreement is now at the White House, but will not 
agree to unfreeze implementation of the EXBS agreement until 
U.S. ratification.  We pressed TAEK and Customs to pressure 
MFA to act faster on EXBS, and EXBS transfered the 
Z-Backscatter van to Turkish Customs.  Customs Enforcement 
and TNP both expressed enthusiasm for working with EXBS and 
SLD.  Further details of his meetings will be included in 
December's monthly reporting cable. 
 
¶B. Training Conducted During this Reporting Period: - None. 
 
¶C. Equipment Delivered During this Reporting Period: - The 
Property Grant for the Z-Backscatter van was formally signed 
by Turkish Customs Enforcement on December 7th, 2007.  Van is 
 
now the property of Turkish Customs and is pending pick-up by 
Customs week of December 10th. 
 
¶D. Imminent Training or Equipment Status Update: 
 
1) As noted earlier, 8 ea- CT-30 Kits and 200 ea- Gerber tool 
kits w/flashlights have arrived at Ankara Airport and are 
currently in bonded storage at a special warehouse for 
radioactive materials.  MFA is working with TAEK and Customs 
to obtain end-user licenses from TAEK and customs clearance. 
Anticipate delivery to Customs Enforcement in 3-4 weeks.  Los 
Alamos Technical Associates (LATA) will need to provide for 
special storage fees for this storage upon release from the 
bonded warehouse.  Expected storage cost will be 
approximately $25 per day for all materials in storage. 
 
¶E. Significant Developments in Export Controls, 
Nonproliferation, or Related Border Security:  The 
Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade continues to work with 
Parliament to update current Export Control Laws to be in 
line with EU Export Control Laws as part of the EU 
harmonization process.  UFT expects these new laws to be 
enacted later in 2008. 
 
¶3. Future Activities:  EXBS Advisor anticipates visiting 
several southern Ports of Entry early January 2008, pending 
MFA, Customs, and TNP acceptance, and approval. 
 
¶4. Red Flag Issues:  None.
