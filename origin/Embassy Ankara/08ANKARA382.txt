SUPPORTING UNSCR 
 
REF: STATE 18101 
 
¶1. (SBU) We discussed reftel with MFA Department Head for 
Maritime Affairs, Mehmet Poroy, on February 27.  Poroy 
provided us with some background on Turkey's previous 
engagement on this issue.  Because of Turkey's involvement in 
the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the IMO 
Secretary General began discussing the issue with Turkey 
 
SIPDIS 
prior to sending his letter to the UN requesting 
consideration of possible actions to address piracy off the 
Somali coast.  In mid-2007, Turkey provided its input to the 
IMO and supported a proposed plan that would request the 
Somali Government's permission for non-Somali naval ships to 
pursue and apprehend pirates in Somali territorial waters. 
As part of NATO, Turkey has also been consulted on the issue 
by IMO. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Poroy was pleased that the USG plans to include the 
Somali Government (TFG) in its discussions about any possible 
UN Security Council resolutions or UN action.  He added that 
while Turkey does not have an official policy on the issue, 
it has already expressed its support for any action that 
would call for TFG authorization to conduct naval operations 
in Somali territorial waters.  He suggested that USG 
representatives approach GOT representatives at the UN to 
discuss possible cooperation and agreed to share this 
information with Turkey's Defense and Justice Ministries as 
well as with its mission to the UN.
