SUBJECT: Mission Turkey's 2006 Ramadan Programming:  Bridging the 
         Divide in Turkey's Polarized Society 
 
 
¶1.  The US mission to Turkey carried out a slate of activities 
during the month of Ramazan (as it is known in Turkey), to 
demonstrate our respect for religious faith and social traditions 
while enhancing and increasing our contacts with religious leaders, 
key figures in various segments of Turkish society, and the broad 
public.  The mission's efforts were broadly welcomed by our 
contacts, demonstrating that the importance of Muslim identity and 
Ramazan traditions for Turkish citizens transcends the contentious 
debate between secular and Islamist camps within Turkey. 
 
¶2.  Ambassador, DCM, Istanbul Consul General, Adana Principal 
Officer and other officers hosted iftars throughout the month. The 
iftars involved senior religious officials, political leaders, 
businesspeople, journalists, and charity heads, and were 
specifically designed to bring together representatives from across 
the spectrum of Turkish society and politics. 
 
¶3.  The mission also carried out humanitarian and outreach 
activities in keeping with the focus on charity and community during 
Ramazan, including food and clothing donations to charities in 
Istanbul and Ankara.  Ambassador and his wife visited a center for 
learning disabled, Istanbul CG provided boxes of food to the 
neighborhood "mukhtar," to share with residents of the consulate's 
neighborhood, and Adana PO visited a city iftar tent to participate 
in the traditional meal as provided to the poor.  DCM and other 
Embassy officers went to Ankara's main mosque on "Kadir Gecesi" - 
traditionally the holiest night of Ramadan - accepting an 
exceptional invitation from the mosque's Imam to join an estimated 
100,000 Turks in attendance.
