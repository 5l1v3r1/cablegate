SUBJECT: U.S.-TURKEY POLICY PLANNING CONSULTATIONS: DATE 
CONFIRMED, PROPOSED AGENDA 
 
¶1. (U) This contains an action request: please see para 8. 
 
¶2. (U)  Turkish MFA Deputy Director General for Policy 
Planning Atilla Gunay informed us that the Turkish side 
accepts the proposed date of February 22 for bilateral policy 
planning talks.  Ambassador Altay Cengizer, who will shortly 
take over the Director General position for policy planning, 
will lead the talks for the Turks (Cengizer, the outgoing 
adviser for FM Gul, is well-versed on U.S.-Turkish relations 
and will accompany the Minister to Washington this weekend). 
 
¶3. (U) We understand as well that Mr. Waxman plans to spend 
February 23 in Istanbul, meeting with think tanks and NGOs. 
 
¶4. (U) We explained how talks usually proceed from the USG 
point of view -- four to six hours of talks, including a 
working lunch, with topics and which side will take the lead 
agreed in advance.  That coincides with how the Turks prefer 
to proceed as well. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In terms of topics, we sketched out S/P's proposals 
-- democracy/good governance, nonproliferation, energy, and 
Russia/Central Asia/the Caucasus.  DDG Gunay, in consultation 
with Ambassador Cengizer, proposed the following expanded 
list: 
 
--Introduction:  Working methods of policy planning units of 
the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the US Department 
of State 
--Priorities of Turkish and American Foreign Policy 
--Relations with the EU 
--Kosovo 
--Middle East (to include Palestine - Israel, Lebanon and 
Iran) 
--South Caucasus 
--Central Asia and Afghanistan 
--Energy Security 
--BMENA, Democratization and Good Governance 
--Relations with China and the Future of China 
 
Gunay said they intended to include nonproliferation under 
the democratization heading. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Turkish proposal is ambitious, but broadens the 
field to include some current Turkish priorities - notably, 
the Middle East.  Given the current focus in this region, we 
strongly support including the Middle East and Iran as an 
opportunity to both lay out our thinking on these topics and 
draw the Turks out.  The proposed addition of China shows the 
Turks are thinking farther afield. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  These talks could not be more timely.  They form a 
cornerstone of the Strategic Dialogue agreed by Secretary 
Rice and FM Gul last July, and come as Turkey faces a year of 
difficult domestic and regional politics.  It is also a year 
with potential pitfalls in U.S.-Turkish relations and having 
the opportunity to address a range of issues where both our 
countries have much at stake - and where we would benefit 
mutually from cooperation - will be key. 
 
¶8. (U) Action request:  Please provide feedback on the 
proposed Turkish agenda soonest so we can have a focused 
agenda in place before February 22.
