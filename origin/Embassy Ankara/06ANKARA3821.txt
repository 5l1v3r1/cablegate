POTATO SALE 
 
REF: NICOSIA 977 
 
¶1. (SBU) We discussed reftel points on June 28 with Engin 
Solakoglu, MFA Cyprus Department chief of section.  Solakoglu 
told us the GOT played no role in the decision by Turkish 
Cypriot authorities to cancel a deal to export Turkish 
Cypriot potatoes to Europe through the Greek Cypriot port of 
Limassol.  He said the GOT does not get involved in such 
minor Cypriot issues, particularly given that the current 
"TRNC" government is more sensitive than its predecessor to 
being perceived as taking instruction from Ankara.  He flatly 
denied that the GOT has offered to compensate the "TRNC" for 
the loss of the sale.  Levent Bilman, MFA DDG for Northeast 
Mediterranean Affairs, also told us separately that the GOT 
played no role in the matter; he said he had not been aware 
of the issue until we told him. 
¶2. (SBU) Solakoglu also said he had not heard about the issue 
until we raised it prior to our appointment, at which time he 
searched for information on the Internet.  He showed us a 
copy of an article by Hasan Ercakica, "TRNC" presidential 
spokesperson, from the June 26 edition of Yeniduzen, in which 
Ercakica argues that the planned exportation was a political 
ploy designed to give the impression that the "TRNC" is not 
economically isolated and thereby pressure Turkey to open its 
ports to Greek Cypriot shipping.  Solakoglu said the article 
is a good indication that the Turkish Cypriots blocked the 
deal on their own, and "if you want to know about it you 
should talk to them."  Solakoglu offered that he agrees with 
the Turkish Cypriot decision; the export deal, he said, was a 
"political trap" that would have undermined the efforts of 
Turkish Cypriots to end their economic isolation without 
bringing any substantial benefits.
