REF: ANKARA 1490 and previous 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of weekly reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary source is the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) website, which documents contacts and clashes with the PKK, as 
well as casualties incurred. 
 
¶2. (U) During the August 16-23, 2008 reporting period, one security 
official died in a military vehicle targeted by a PKK IED in Sirnak 
Province on August 18.  Thirty-six security officials were injured, 
including three in clashes, ten when targeted by PKK IEDs and 23 
when car bombs went off in Mersin and Izmir.  Since the TGS website 
does not include incidents that occur in city centers (which are 
left to Turkish National Police jurisdiction) we should elaborate 
that out of those 23 who were injured in PKK car bombs, 13 of them 
were policemen injured August 19 in Mersin, and three were soldiers 
and another seven of them policemen injured August 21 in Izmir.  The 
total number of security force casualties for the year through 
August 23, 2008, was 80 killed and 142 injured. 
 
¶3. (U) During the same period, two PKK terrorists were killed in 
clashes in Yuksekova, Hakkari Province on August 22.  One PKKer was 
captured and five surrendered.  According to official TGS website 
figures, through the third week of August, the number of PKK 
militants killed this year was 567, the number of those captured was 
126, and the number of those who surrendered was 106. 
 
¶4. (U) During the reporting period one citizen was found executed by 
the PKK in Gurpinar, Van Province on August 21.  Nine civilians were 
injured, including one by a PKK IED, two during clashes and six in 
the car explosion in Izmir.  The total number of civilian casualties 
for the year through the end of the third week of August, was 41 
killed, with another 238 wounded.  The PKK also reportedly kidnapped 
five civilians in four separate incidents during the reporting 
period.
