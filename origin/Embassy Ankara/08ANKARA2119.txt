SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT 
TUESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 2008 
 
In Today's Papers 
 
The New Symbol of Resistance in Iraq (Sabah) 
Media outlets prominently feature the Iraqi journalist's shoe 
protest as the top story of the day.  NTV carries footage of public 
protests in support of the journalist and reports, "Protesters hit 
the streets in support of the Iraqi journalist."  Mainstream 
Hurriyet carries the front-page banner headline, "World Shoe Day," 
as "The journalist who threw his shoe at President Bush is declared 
a hero in Iraq."  Mainstream Sabah calls the infamous shoe, "The New 
Symbol of Resistance in Iraq."  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak carries 
the headline, "The Iraqi Journalist Ignites the Fires of Freedom in 
Iraq."  Islamist-oriented Zaman reports, "This Journalist Is Now a 
Public Hero."   Liberal Radikal carries the headline, "A New Flag 
Greets Bush," and carries a photo of a shoe on a flagpole beside a 
sign saying "U.S. Get Out."  Mainstream Milliyet reports, "The 
Journalist Everyone Is Talking About," is, "The Latest Hero of the 
Arab World."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports, "His Shoes 
Left a Footprint," as "Iraqis filled the streets and waved their 
shoes in a show of support for the journalist." 
 
Can Atakli writes in mainstream Vatan, "When U.S. troops invaded 
Iraq in 2003, some people beat Saddam statues with their slippers. 
At first, this looked like a very funny act to all of us.  Later, we 
learned that this act is a grave insult for Iraqis and thus we 
understood and respected their feelings.  The Iraqi journalist's 
insult against Bush is a symbolic act.  Americans may not even care 
about this insult, but they should know that this symbolic act will 
remain in the minds of all people who are against America's mistaken 
policies." 
 
Derya Sazak writes in mainstream Milliyet, "The shoe thrown at 
President Bush is a well-deserved farewell gift for him.  When the 
U.S. invaded Iraq five years ago, Iraqis threw their slippers at 
statues of Saddam and welcomed U.S. troops with flowers.  Five years 
later, those slippers are now shoes and they are aimed Bush.  In the 
name of 'democracy and freedom,' the Bush administration invaded 
Iraq and the country has deteriorated so badly that the Iraqi people 
miss former dictator Saddam Hussein.  Moreover, in the past five 
years, one million Iraqi people have lost their lives.  After all 
the problems he has caused in Iraq, Bush shamelessly says, 'I don't 
understand why this man would throw shoes at me!'  Allow me to 
explain - this man is enraged by your false claims of WMDs in Iraq 
five years ago." 
 
President Gul Will Not Travel to Iraq, Russia, or Israel as Planned 
Sabah, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Turkiye, Zaman and others:  Today's 
papers report that President Gul will not engage in several foreign 
trips due to an ear infection.  Mainstream Sabah reports that 
following doctors' recommendation President Gul cancelled his trips 
to Baghdat on December 20, to Russia on December 25-28, to Israel 
and Palestine on January 6-8.  Mainstream Milliyet reports that a 
statement from the Presidential Palace said that doctors recommended 
President Gul should not travel until mid January. 
 
Ergenekon Suspect Veli Kucuk's Defense 
All papers report that Ergenekon suspect Veli Kucuk took the stand 
in his defense yesterday and rejected all accusations against him. 
He also claimed he was victim of a "state conspiracy plot."  Kucuk 
said that the Ergenekon indictment targeted the Turkish nation and 
the republic founded by Ataturk.  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak 
reports that during his defense, Kucuk revealed the names of three 
secret witnesses of Ergenekon trial.  Kucuk's revealing of the names 
was a warning for the other secret witnesses, adds the paper. 
 
Reactions to Apology Campaign to Armenians 
 
Papers carry a joint statement issued by a group of retired Turkish 
diplomats who slammed the recent internet petition campaign seeking 
a public apology to Armenians regarding the 1915 incidents.  A group 
 
ANKARA 00002119  002 OF 002 
 
 
of 60 former ambassadors and diplomats, including some current 
members of the parliament, said in a joint statement that the 
apology campaign is "unfair, wrong and unfavorable for the national 
interests."  In addition, the statement said, "Such an incorrect and 
one-sided attempt would lead to disrespecting our history and 
betraying our people who lost their lives in the violent attacks of 
the terror organizations in the final days of the Ottoman Empire, as 
well as after, during the formation of the Republic." 
 
Editorial opinion: 
Ali Bayramoglu says in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "The Turkish 
identity should not be based on fears and taboos.  But at the same 
time, the Turkish identity should not be defensive.  Once we face 
history, we will be liberated." 
 
Several papers like Milliyet, Sabah and Radikal reminded their 
readers about the ongoing internet campaign by providing the 
address, www.ozurdiliyoruz.com which has received more than 3,000 
names. 
 
Sharp Decline in Economic Growth 
 
Papers feature coverage of recent declines in economic indicators. 
Business daily Dunya carries the headline, "Economic Stagnation." 
Business daily Referans reports, "Turkey almost avoided recession 
but now unemployment has reached a peak." The Turkish Statistical 
Institute announced that third quarter gross domestic product grew 
0.5 percent, which is the slowest pace during the same quarter over 
the last six years.  The number of unemployed was registered as 
2,548,000 which reached to 10.3 percent. 
 
Meanwhile all papers report an announcement by the Turkish Treasury 
indicating that an IMF delegation will officially arrive Turkey in 
January 2009 for talks regarding the 20th stand-by agreement. 
 
 
Editorial opinion on Riots in Greece 
Yalcin Dogan wrote in mainstream Hurriyet: "The Turkish media is 
misrepresenting the nature of the riots in Greece.  This is not 
happening, contrary to common belief, because the police killed a 
young man.  That killing merely sparked the riots, which are meant 
to send messages against corruption in the government, extreme 
privatization, and unemployment."
