In Today's Papers 
 
AKP insists it has no "Comprehensive Kurdish Plan" 
All papers speculate on Prime Minister Erdogan remarks from last 
week that "the government's priority is to make terrorists lay down 
arms; they can choose democracy or remain in the mountains." Media 
implies that the PM has a "comprehensive Kurdish plan" which he 
allegedly discussed with President Bush.  Opposition CHP leader 
Deniz Baykal claims Erdogan - based on these comments - plans to 
declare amnesty for the terrorists.  "It will be an extremely 
dangerous situation if we begin political negotiations with the 
PKK," Baykal said.  AKP deputy chairman Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat said 
there was no new plan and that Erdogan has made similar statements 
for the past four or five years.  Government Spokesman Cemil Cicek 
said that armed struggle is not a clever choice, especially since 
democratic struggle is within the framework of the law.  He also 
noted the government had no plans for declaring amnesty. 
 
Columnists such as Murat Yetkin of liberal Radikal and Ibrahim 
Karagul of Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak urged the government to 
disclose Turkey's comprehensive Kurdish plan.  Both columnists 
believe the plan was discussed during Secretary Rice's meetings in 
Ankara and with President Bush in Washington, D.C. and that this 
comprehensive plan includes some level of amnesty. 
 
Meanwhile, columnist Enis Berberoglu of Hurriyet speculated that, 
after northern Iraqi Kurdish leaders softened their position 
regarding a Turkish military operation, there are no more obstacles 
against a cross border operation.  Berberoglu wrote that a Turkish 
cross border operation could happen at any minute. 
 
Kurds Ban Reporters' Access to PKK Bases in Northern Iraq 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others report the 
Kurdish regional government (KRG) in northern Iraq has banned 
journalists from traveling to PKK bases in the Kandil Mountains. 
KRG spokesman Jamal Abdullah accused the media of aggravating the 
crisis with Turkey.  "We are trying different ways to calm the 
situation with Turkey," he said.  Abdullah denied accusations that 
Kurdish Peshmerge had detained several journalists. 
 
Turkey Gives Note to Iran for Abducted People in Van 
Hurriyet, Cumhuriyet:  Interior Minister Besir Atalay said that 
Turkey delivered a diplomatic note to Iran regarding seven people 
from Van who were kidnapped last week.  "Since the abduction 
happened in Baskale, which is near our border with Iran, we think 
that our citizens were taken there.  Therefore, we have delivered a 
diplomatic note to Iran." 
 
Axa Insurance Company Compensates Families of Armenians Killed in 
World War I 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Radikal and others:  French Insurance Company 
Axa, acting upon the verdict of a California Court in 2005, paid a 
total of 14.5 million USD to three Armenian associations who will 
distribute the money to 7000 descendants of those who died in the 
incidents of 1915.  The Armenians who opened the court case claimed 
that their relatives had insured themselves before 1915, but their 
inheritors did not receive any payment. Milliyet's headline on the 
issue reads "Genocide Compensation from Axa". 
 
Editorial Opinion on Kosovo 
Sami Kohen commented in mainstream daily Milliyet: "Taci, the winner 
of Kosovo's recent elections, speaks of a new era there.  When 
independence is declared in December, it will mark a new era for 
Kosovo, yet there are many issues to work out.  The Serbian minority 
in Kosovo does not want to be separated from Belgrade.  Moreover, 
neither the EU nor the UN, including the Troika, is united in their 
opinions concerning Kosovo independence.  Therefore, if Taci 
declares independence on December 10 as he promised, it will be a 
complex, conflict-filled and painful era for Kosovo.  It is not 
clear how the international community will react if Kosovo

unilaterally declares its independence.  The US supports 
independence in principle while the EU members do not agree 
unanimously on this issue.  Russia sides with the opposition within 
the EU nations, such as Spain, Cyprus and Greece.  After all, each 
country shapes its policy based on its own interests and not 
according to territorial integrity and separatism."
