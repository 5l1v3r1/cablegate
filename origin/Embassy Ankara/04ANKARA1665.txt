BRIEFING 
 
 
Cyprus:  All papers report that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas announced that he will not participate in the four- 
party talks in Switzerland.  `TRNC Prime Minister' Talat 
will stand in for him.  Denktas said that he is not hopeful 
of seeing an agreement come out of the talks.  Denktas said 
that if he had gone to Zurich, people would have thought 
that everything was progressing smoothly.  "Radikal" says 
the Turkish Government heard of Denktas' decision from the 
media, and that PM Erdogan was annoyed by the surprise 
announcement.  After the four-party talks in Zurich, Annan 
is expected to fill in the remaining blanks in the Cyprus 
agrrement. 
 
 
YOK Withdraws From Education Reform Talks:  "Cumhuriyet" 
reports that Turkish Higher Education Board (YOK) officials 
have withdrawn from education reform discussions.  The paper 
speculated that the decision was motivated by the AKP 
government's determination to expand educational privileges 
for theology school students. 
 
 
General Myers on the PKK:  Most papers and TV channels 
covered comments by US Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, 
General Richard Myers, concerning the US commitment to 
eliminate the threat posed by the PKK.  At a press 
conference, General Myers was asked whether the US would 
take action against the PKK.  Myers responded that Turkey 
and the US are holding discussions on the issue at the 
political and military level in order to decide on an 
appropriate course of action against the PKK. 
 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: Campaign Against Terrorism/Spain/NATO 
 
 
"Is NATO Diminishing?" 
Zeynep Atikkan observed in the mass appeal-sensational Aksam 
(3/18): "The upcoming NATO summit is in fact going to shape 
the alliance's role for the future.  The nature of new 
missions, which NATO might be undertaking, will largely 
depend on the developments in Iraq.  The Greater Middle East 
initiative will be brought up to the G-8 summit first, and 
later the US will bring it to NATO.  The US will most likely 
center its argument around whether NATO should be actively 
engaged in the region's democratization and stabilization 
process, unless the alliance wants to retire.  . Bush 
administration hopes to charge NATO with new tasks, 
particularly on Iraq, prior to the presidential elections. 
The Istanbul summit will provide a venue for the exchange of 
ideas and perceptions between `old Europe' and the `new 
Europe' about the  role of NATO in 21st century.  Rumsfeld 
underlined the importance of a single NATO while 
acknowledging the existence of Europe in two categories, the 
old and the new Europe.  There is no way to make two NATOs, 
therefore the Istanbul summit either will come up with a 
revitalization, or the retirement of NATO." 
 
 
"Terror and making a choice" 
Hadi Uluengin asserted in the mass appeal Huriyet (3/18): 
"The elections in Spain provided a tactical victory for 
terrorism.  This statement comes from former Secretary of 
State James Rubin, and is absolutely a reflection of the 
truth. . Let's be honest about the situation.  Islamic 
fundamentalists carried out an act of punishment and they 
achieved two goals.   The government in Spain lost and 
terrorism affected democracy to the benefit of the 
terrorists.  This means that terror has become a `player' in 
the international politics.  These are all very critical 
developments and providing a tactical victory for terrorism 
will bring very serious consequences. . The situation is as 
clear as black and white.  We all have to make a clear 
choice between `life' and `death.'  Otherwise, tactical 
victory gradually becomes a strategic victory and that is a 
defeat of humanity."
