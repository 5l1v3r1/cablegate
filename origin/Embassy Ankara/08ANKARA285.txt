SUBJECT: TURKEY:  ANKARA CONFERENCE DISCUSSES HOW TO 
RESOLVE THE KURDISH ISSUE 
 
REF: 07 ANKARA 2731 
 
1.(SBU) Summary and comment:  Over 800 academics, 
journalists, human rights NGOs, and Kurdish politicians 
discussed nonviolent solutions to Turkey's Kurdish problem 
February 9-10 at the Turkish Peace Assembly's Ankara 
conference, "Democratization and the Kurdish Issue in the New 
Constitutional Process."  Speakers unanimously urged more 
dialogue, and argued that the new Turkish constitution now 
being considered should devolve authority to local 
administrations and recognize cultural "sub-identities" such 
as Kurdish, Greek, and Armenian.  The diversity of speakers 
expressing previously taboo viewpoints in a fairly open 
atmosphere was the conference's most striking aspect; similar 
remarks previously have led to arrests and convictions for 
"inciting terrorism" or "contravening the indivisibility of 
the state."  While the conference produced constructive 
proposals, the absence of participants from the ruling 
Justice and Development Party (AKP) and main opposition 
parties diminished the conference's impact.  End summary and 
comment.

"Kurdish Issue" Conference Draws Large Crowd 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU)  Academics, journalists, NGO representatives and 
Kurdish politicians gathered in Ankara February 9-10 to 
discuss how the Kurdish issue might be addressed in the new 
constitution AKP is drafting.  The Turkish Peace Assembly 
(TPA), a 2007-founded civil society group focused on 
peacefully solving the Kurdish issue, brought together 
speakers from across the country to discuss regional 
administration, cultural rights and identities, women's 
issues and nonviolence means of dispute settlement.  In 
opening remarks, former Hacetepe University Professor Cengiz 
Gulec reminded the audience that freedom of expression means 
the ability to oppose government or majority ideas without 
being accused of threatening the indivisible unity of the 
state.  His message was underscored, coincidentally, by a 
200,000-person strong secularist protest, occurring nearby, 
of those opposed to lifting the headscarf ban at 
universities. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Recommendations: Strengthen Local Administrations, 
Reduce Militarism, and Redefine Citizenship 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
¶3. (SBU) One panel proposed giving additional authority to 
local administrations to bring the country together instead 
of fueling separatism.  Istanbul University Professor Oktay 
Uygun told the audience that Turkey's strong central 
government has failed to solve the Kurdish problem.  He 
suggested following the French system, with the central 
government retaining essential national functions such as 
defense and monetary policy and local parliaments exercising 
control over issues such as culture, education, and health. 
Uygun emphasized that such a model would not be possible 
until guns are silenced.  Former pro-Kurdish DEP MP Hatip 
Dicle suggested dividing up Turkey into 20-25 autonomous 
regions that could wave the national flag and a regional flag. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Another panel asserted Turkey should respect 
different cultural identities.  Ankara University Professor 
Baskin Oran, delivering the same argument that led to his 
trial and conviction of inciting hatred and denigrating 
"Turkishness" (reftel), maintained that Turkey could not 
solve its Kurdish problem until it recognizes a 
territorial-based Turkish "supra-identity" and cultural 
"sub-identities," such as Kurd, Armenian, and Greek. 
Abdullah Demirbas, fired as Diyarbakir Sur mayor and being 
tried for using Kurdish in municipal services, argued it is 
impossible to run a well-operating government in the 
Southeast without using Kurdish.  Many of his former 
constituents are now unable to use public services such as 
health care because they do not understand Turkish. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Several speakers called for an end to armed 
conflict.  "Vatan" columnist Rusen Cakir said the first step 
is for the PKK to lay down weapons unconditionally.  Cakir 
warned the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society party (DTP) that it 
 
ANKARA 00000285  002 OF 002 
 
 
must distance itself from the PKK.  If it fails to do so, 
growing Islamic forces close to AKP and controlled by Turkish 
Hizbullah and Fethullah Gulen would continue to diminish the 
Kurds' political power.  DTP Mardin MP Emine Ayna responded 
that the first step to a peaceful environment is for the 
Turkish military to end its operations.  Ayna added the media 
contributes to instability by portraying the DTP negatively. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The TPA released a communique following the 
conference recommending the AKP's new constitution abolish 
the military's role in politics; strengthen local 
administrations; protect citizen's basic economic, social, 
and cultural rights; and redefine Turkish citizenship to 
prevent discrimination because of ethnic, religious, sexual, 
or political backgrounds.
