Enforcement Deputy Director General Mehmet Guzel to discuss 
recent Turkish Customs activities.  EXBS Advisor provided 
Guzel with information concerning the suggested replacement 
of portal monitors for the border crossing and to confirm 
upcoming meetings with DOE SLD representatives.  Guzel stated 
that he is very interested in the new equipment and that his 
technician will be available to discuss the possible change 
in equipment.  EXBS Advisor also provided updated information 
on the upcoming orientation visit that will occur for senior 
Turkish Customs officials later in the month.  Guzel informed 
EXBS Advisor that the Undersecretary for Turkish Customs was 
required to remove himself from the orientation visit due to 
other pressing government business in Turkey, but hoped to 
have an opportunity to meet with senior U.S. officials in the 
future.  The remaining members of the Turkish delegation have 
completed all their preparations and were ready for the trip; 
all believing that the exposure they will receive from the 
outlined program should greatly assist them in their current 
positions and also in planning for the future of Turkish 
Customs. 
 
2)           Nov 8 - EXBS Advisor met with MFA Arms Control 
and Disarmament First Secretary Serhan Yigit to conduct 
monthly update meeting on all current projects in progress in 
Turkey, including Internal Control Program (ICP), Commodity 
Identification Training (CIT), Product Identification Tool 
(PIT) and Second Line of Defense (SLD).  EXBS advisor 
reviewed the progress that was completed by UFT with the ICP 
project; however he raised concerns that the PIT project 
remains stagnant and is in jeopardy of being canceled due to 
lack of progress.  Yigit stated he would look into the issue 
and try to overcome the delays.  Yigit informed EXBS Advisor 
that he would be meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister the 
next day to provide additional information concerning the NP 
Cooperation Agreement in preparation for any questions the 
Grand National Assembly might have as the Agreement is 
considered for ratification. 
 
3)           Nov 9 - EXBS Advisor and DOE SLD Turkey Desk 
Officer Erik Deschler met with Customs Enforcement Head of 
Department Mehmet Guzel to review/discuss plans to provide 
replacement equipment for the currently installed old single 
channel portal monitors with a more dependable and accurate 
dual channel monitor.  Deschler briefed on the capabilities 
of the suggested replacement equipment and that the exchanges 
can be accomplished under the preexisting agreement under 
which the original monitors were installed.  EXBS Advisor

Customs Orientation.

Attach Robert Stiriti met with DG for EU and External

ANKARA 00006662  002 OF 003 
 
 
members of the EU Customs Union.  Korkmaz added that even 
with the cooperation with the EU, he looks forward to 
increased cooperation with the US following the final 
ratification of the NP Agreement. 
 
5)           Nov 16 - EXBS Advisor met with Undersecretariat 
of Foreign Trade (UFT) Agreements Department Head Ziya 
Demirduzen to review the progress of the ICP project, to 
evaluate the translation of the EU control list and to 
discuss other possible areas of cooperation. Demirduzen 
informed EXBS Advisor that UFT has experienced difficulties 
in receiving the comments on the translation of the EU 
control list from other government agencies due to their 
concerns about acting on the NP Agreement prior to its 
ratification by the Turkish Parliament.  This delay in 
receiving the comments will cause a postponement of the ICP 
Instructor Training and the Industry-Government Forum, which 
were both planned for December.  Demirduzen has been in 
contact with MFA and was seeking assistance and guidance 
concerning appropriate courses of action. 
 
6)          Nov 20 - EXBS Advisor met with MFA Arms Control 
and Disarmament First Secretary Serhan Yigit to discuss the 
problems being experienced by UFT concerning the ICP project. 
 Yigit informed EXBS Advisor that a letter was prepared and 
sent by FM Gul to the related institutions informing them 
that the MFA did not consider supporting the ICP project as 
working around the pending NP Agreement.  However, Yigit 
stated that until the NP Agreement is ratified the MFA does 
not possess the ability to compel compliance by the other 
institutions to assist with these projects.  EXBS Advisor 
explained how the delay could negatively impact the project 
and possibly other projects.  Yigit replied that he will 
inform the MFA leadership and investigate other possible 
courses of action. Finally, Yigit informed EXBS Advisor that 
he met with the Deputy Foreign Minister and the Dep FM had 
been in contact with several Parliamentarians concerning the 
NP Cooperation Agreement. 
 
7)          Nov 30 - EXBS Advisor met with Customs 
Enforcement Deputy Director General Mehmet Guzel and other 
officials who participated in the orientation visit to the 
United States.  Guzel informed EXBS Advisor that the trip was 
very successful, meeting all expectations and that the 
Turkish Officials received a wealth of information concerning 
training, equipment, procedures and planning for the future. 
The information obtained during the visit will establish the 
foundation from which the Turkish Customs organization will 
begin to develop plans for future.  Guzel also stated that 
exposure to the Customs Training Academy showed the 
importance of a proper and effective training program for new 
officials.  Turkey had been considering formalizing their 
training program by establishing an academy and the 
information gained during the visit will be very influential 
in this development.  Guzel hopes to build on this experience 
by having other Turkish Customs official take part in future 
international activities conducted by the U.S. CBP.
