(U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche on July 12 to MFA 
Americas and International Organizations offices.  Americas 
Desk's initial reaction was noncommittal; speculating that 
the Cuban resolution was motivated by politics, not 
necessity.  Our interlocutor also noted Cuba previously 
tabled a resolution that focused on Guantanamo Bay detainees 
but undertook to convey to Turkey's UN mission the substance 
of the demarche, and the Department's strong opposition to 
the Cuban draft resolution.
