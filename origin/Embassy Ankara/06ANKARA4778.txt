REF: ANKARA 4587 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on 
PKK violence in Turkey (see reftels).  Our primary sources 
for these reports are mainstream Turkish press services, such 
as the Anatolian News Agency, and international wire 
services.  While these sources are more reliable than most 
Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  Press services sympathetic to the PKK, such 
as Neu-Isenburg People's Defense Forces and Firat News 
Agency, tend to report higher numbers of Turkish Security 
Forces casualties. 
 
¶2. (U) According to press reports, three members of the 
Turkish Security Forces were killed and four were wounded 
over the period August 7 - August 13.  Two PKK terrorists 
were killed and nineteen were arrested.  Six civilians, 
including the son of the NCO killed during a home invasion on 
August 7 (see reftels), were wounded.  On August 13, an 
explosion in front of an internet cafe in Istanbul injured 
the other five civilians.  In the same period, Turkish forces 
seized 11.7 kg of explosives and 31 handguns (20 GLOCK, 5 
WALTHER, and 6 SIG SAUER) during counter-PKK engagements. 
 
¶3. (U) We estimate that in 2006, approximately twenty-three 
civilians and up to 194 members of the Turkish Security 
Forces have perished as a result of PKK violence.
