In Today's urkish Foreign Ministry (MFA) told Yeni 
Safak Turkey will participate in a March 10 foreign ministerial 
meeting in Baghdad, which would include the US, UK, France, Russia, 
and China.  Zaman says the first meeting will be held in Baghdad on 
March 11 and then Cairo will host the second gathering.  Several 
papers say Ankara is trying to incorporate the G-8 members, Germany, 
Japan and Italy and the UN Security Council's permanent members, 
into the second meeting expected to be held in Istanbul.  Vatan 
reports Ankara will invite Talabani to attend a meeting of Iraq's 
neighbors in Istanbul in April. If the meeting takes place, says 
Hurriyet, Secretary Rice will come together with the representatives 
of Iran and Syria, countries characterized by the US as "rogue 
states." 
 
Turks React to Secretary Rice's Use of 'Kurdistan' 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, Yeni Safak 
and others report on Turkish leaders' reaction to Secretary Rice's 
testimony at the US Senate Appropriations Committee, during which 
the Secretary said, "The PKK, operating on the border between Turkey 
and Kurdistan, is responsible for attacks into Turkey."  Justice 
Minister Cemil Cicek said "Turkey's neighbor to the south is Iraq. 
We do not accept such statements." 
Prime Minister Erdogan told CNN-Turk yesterday that Rice's was "a 
wrong statement," and that "such statements do not matter that much, 
what matters is some 60-70 Muslims are killed in Iraq every day.  It 
disturbs us a lot." 
 
In addition, Zaman says Rice has signaled change to the three-party 
mechanism among Turkey, the US, and Iraq when she said, "When we 
speak of negotiations, it's really discussions between the Kurds and 
the Turks and the Iraqi government, and we are facilitating that. 
And I have retired General Ralston as an envoy to do this, to try 
and mitigate those circumstances and to try to diminish the ability 
of the PKK to attack Turkish territory." 
 
Commenting in the mass appeal Vatan, Okay Gonensin urges a change in 
the Turkish debate over "the Kurdish issue and Kurdistan":  "When it 
comes to the debate about Kurdistan and the Kurdish issue, we see 
the resurrection of old-fashioned formulas.  In fact the discussion 
of Kurdistan requires that it be taken up in combination with the 
Kurdish issue in Turkey as well as the terrorism problem.  How can 
we explain the double standard, as we support sovereign status for 
Turkish Cypriots?  The Kurdistan issue should be taken up free from 
k and vention in Ankara the Kurdish issue and added that the PKK 
should be given the chance to take part in the political process. 
Turk told his party members that the party will be elected to 
Parliament even if candidates have to run as Independents.  Tugluk 
also said that the solitary confinement of jailed PKK leader Ocalan 
should be ended.

Sabah, Milliyet, Radikal and others:  Queen Beatrix was in the 
central Anatolian province of Kayseri yesterday, the home province 
of many of The Netherlands' 350,000 strong Turkish community.  FM 
Gul and his wife accompanied the queen to Kayseri.  Prince Willlem 
Alexander and Princess Maxima were in Ankara to attend a meeting on 
intercultural dialogue at Middle East Technical University.  The 
Queen met with PM Erdogan on the second day of her visit to Turkey 
on the sidelines of an economy meeting at the Prime Minister's 
residence.  Speaking at the meeting Beatrix said company 
representatives would discuss ways to improve bilateral relations. 
Today, the Royal party will be in Istanbul. 
 
Editorial Commentary: Withdrawing from Iraq 
Zafer Atay comments in the economic-political Dunya: "The British 
government has been pulling forces out of Iraq without announcing it 
-- disguising it under other pretexts, such as tactical reasons. 
This time it was made official and Blair declared that the number of 
troops will be reduced first to 5,500 and then to 5,000 this summer. 
 Since Denmark, South Korea and Poland are also preparing to pull 
out from Iraq, there will be almost no coalitiontic News
