In Today's Papers 
 
Turkey Bans Smoking in Public Places 
All papers report a law prohibiting smoking in public places across 
Turkey entered into effect Monday.  The law prohibits smoking in 
government offices, workplaces, shopping malls, schools, sports 
arenas, and hospitals.  The ban also covers public transport 
including taxis and railway, seaway and airway transportation.  The 
law also bans tobacco advertisements and tobacco sales to people 
under the age of 18.  The smoking ban in restaurants, cafeterias, 
and coffeehouses will go into effect July 19 next year. 
 
Mainstream Milliyet reports today the ban had little effect, saying 
some of the police officers responsible for enforcement were smoking 
in public buildings.  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak believes the new 
smoking ban will succeed, and those who violated the ban were not 
aware of the new restrictions.  Several papers cite a Guardian story 
which says the smoking ban would be a "deep cultural shock" for 
Turks. 
 
Turkey Celebrates Youth Day 
All news outlets report Youth Day was celebrated throughout Turkey 
yesterday.  The national holiday commemorates the day Ataturk, the 
founder of modern Turkey, landed in Samsun to launch the struggle 
for independence.  A group of politicians and top level bureaucrats 
led by President Abdullah Gul paid respects at the mausoleum of 
Ataturk in Ankara.  Official ceremonies were held at Turkish 
embassies around the world and in Turkish Cyprus as well.  Prime 
Minister Erdogan did not join the celebrations because of an 
eye-related health problem.  A column in mainstream Vatan claims 
Erdogan, who attended a ceremony in the nearby city of Eskisehir on 
Saturday, did not participate in the ceremonies held Monday due to 
fears that he might be protested by a crowd gathered to mark a 
secular holiday. 
 
Foreign Minister Ali Babacan Will Visit Washington InEarly June 
Islamist-oriented Zaman reports Foreign Minister Ali Babacan will 
pay an official visit to Washington from June 3-9, and has asked for 
appointments with Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice, and the president's national security advisor 
Stephen Hadley.  Babacan is expected to address a think tank in 
Washington before moving on to New York on June 9 to lobby for 
Turkey's seat at the UN Security Council during 2009-2010. 
 
Rice and Nechirvan Barzani Meet in Washington 
Mainstream Sabah and NTV report Tuesday Secretary Rice met with 
visiting Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) Prime Minister Nechirvan 
Barzani in Washington.  State Department Spokesman Sean McCormack 
said Iraq's internal politics and the PKK were discussed in the 
meeting, according to Sabah. 
 
Editorial Commentary on AKP Closure Case 
 
"A Formula to Ease Tensions" 
Erdal Safak commented in mainstream Sabah (5/20):  "Parliamentary 
Speaker Koksal Toptan has encouraged the Constitutional Court to 
come up with another formula instead of closing the AKP.  Actually, 
since the beginning of the case, the AKP has received suggestions 
from inside Turkey and from abroad.  Let me highlight one fact:  The 
AKP closure case was not opened because the party amended the 
constitution to allow the headscarf in universities; the US and the 
EU played a major role in bringing the AKP to this point.   Armed 
with a desire to topple Saddam Huseyin before September 11, 
President Bush wrapped up his ambitions in a project called, "The 
Greater Middle East Project (GMP)."  He wanted to bring democracy to 
Islamic geography, from Morocco to Pakistan.  When the AKP came to 
power in Turkey, it inspired the White House in its efforts toward 
its Islamic democracy project.   Despite objections by prominent 
Turkish officials, US officials continually referred to Turkey as 
exhibiting "moderate Islam" and describing Turks as "Muslim 
 
ANKARA 00000958  002 OF 003 
 
 
Democrats" and Turkey as "the country accommodating both Islam and 
democracy."  At the end, the GMP initiative failed, but, by then, 
Turkey was already labeled as "moderately Islamic."  EU officials 
also referred to "moderate Islam" and "Turkey as an example for the 
Islamic world."  Turkey-EU Joint Commission co-Chairman Lagendijk 
recently advised Prime Minister Erdogan to drop everything else from 
the AKP agenda and pursue reforms to strengthen secularism.  I wish 
Lagendijk had come up with this advice earlier.  Nevertheless, I 
agree and support Lagendijk's advice because that is the only 
formula to ease tensions in this country." 
 
"Turkey Will Have A Hard Time Explaining The AKP's Closure" 
Semih Idiz wrote in mainstream Milliyet (5/19):  "The AKP closure 
case is followed closely by Western and Arab diplomats.  The Western 
world expresses their concerns by saying "in a democracy, the people 
determine the government by elections."  All the ambassadors I 
talked to recently believe that this closure case is a "political 
decision" and the AKP will be closed in the end.  This means if the 
AKP is closed, Turkey's democracy will suffer.  Moreover, relations 
with the EU will be affected and those who oppose Turkey's EU 
membership will be emboldened.  This situation will result in 
increased hostility toward the West.  In short, the ban on the AKP 
will have a long-term negative impact on Turkey.  Meanwhile, Ankara 
will dedicate all its energy explaining the closure case to the 
world.  Unfortunately, these signals indicate that Turkey will have 
a hard time explaining this case." 
 
Work Accidents Claim Two More Lives at Tuzla Shipyards 
All papers reported over the weekend and today two more fatal work 
accidents at Istanbul's Tuzla shipyards.  Twenty-one workers have 
died at the shipyards since July 2007.  The latest victim, Murat 
Caliskan, fell 25 meters to his death from a welding platform while 
working at night.  Mainstream Sabah carries Caliskan's lawyer's 
statement regarding the tragedy, "This is Murder, Not An Accident," 
Liberal Radikal blames the authorities for not enforcing safety 
measures despite the fact that such simple measures would help 
prevent deadly accidents.  Labor Minister Faruk Celik said the fatal 
incidents were likely to continue: "There are 50 shipyards in an 
area that should only have 20 shipyards.  If you certify so many 
shipyards in such a small area, then these kinds of grave incidents 
will continue to occur," he told the press.  Main opposition CHP 
Leader Deniz Baykal criticized Celik for his remarks and demanded 
his resignation.  Tuesday papers report shipyard workers will stage 
a demonstration to demand tighter safety measures at the shipyards.
