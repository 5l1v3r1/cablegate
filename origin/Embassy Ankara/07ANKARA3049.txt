In Today's Papers 
 
Benazir Bhutto Killed, Pakistan in Chaos 
All papers report former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was 
shot dead yesterday at a political rally.  The assassin then blew 
himself up, leaving 20 others dead and dozens wounded.  Former Prime 
Minister Bhutto is revered in the Turkish press today as "the first 
female prime minister in a Muslim country." 
 
Papers see the assassination as an attack on democracy and 
stability; papers also express fear that the event may set off a new 
wave of terrorism in Pakistan.  According to speculation, elections 
could be postponed and another state of emergency declared. 
Mainstream papers underline emphasize that Bhutto was a "brave" 
politician who was "prepared for the worst."  According to 
mainstream Sabah, al-Qaeda leader Mustafa Abu al-Yezid said from 
Afghanistan, "we have eliminated America's most valuable asset." 
Liberal Radikal notes she was the leading opposition candidate for 
the January 8 elections.  Mainstream Hurriyet says Bhutto told 
President Abdullah Gul during his visit to Pakistan earlier this 
month that Pakistan wants to use Turkey's democracy as a model for 
their own democracy. 
 
Turkish Reactions to Bhutto's Assassination 
All papers report Turkey strongly condemned the killing of former 
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.  The Turkish Foreign 
Ministry (MFA) said Thursday "Turkey believes the people of Pakistan 
will act with calm and will not allow the democratization process to 
be destroyed."  The Turkish parliament released a declaration signed 
by all political parties, including the ruling AKP and opposition 
CHP, MHP, DTP, and DSP, condemning the assassination and calling for 
those responsible to be brought to justice.  President Abdullah Gul 
said he was "deeply saddened" by the assassination, stressing there 
should be "no more bloodshed."  He added, "Pakistan is experiencing 
a critical period.  What will happen with the elections, how will 
they proceed?  For us, Pakistan is a brotherly country, we should 
help them." Prime Minister Erdogan strongly condemned the 
assassination and expressed his condolences to President Musharraf 
over the telephone.  According to papers, Erdogan told Musharraf he 
hoped the attack would not hamper the democratization process in 
Pakistan. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Assassination of Benazir Bhutto 
Okay Gonensin commented in mainstream Vatan (12/28):  "By 
assassinating Benazir Bhutto, radical Islamists took a significant 
step in their quest to dominate Pakistan.  Next month's elections 
certainly will be postponed and this Muslim country will be dragged 
into chaos.  Radical Islamists will benefit from this chaotic 
atmosphere.  When we look at other Muslim countries like Iran, 
Palestine, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Algeria, Malaysia and others, 
we see the way radical Islam's influence progresses through unstable 
countries.  This is a very serious situation in Pakistan.  So far, 
Turkey has managed to stay away from radicalization.  That is why 
the Western world should acknowledge Turkey's importance for the 
world's future." 
 
Ergun Babahan wrote in mainstream Sabah (12/28):  "Pakistan's tribal 
infrastructure, inadequate education system, and decrepit human 
rights situation formed the perfect atmosphere for violence.  This 
bloody attack will drag Pakistan onto a darker path.  As we closely 
follow the developments in Pakistan, I believe that we should 
appreciate the virtue of our own democracy." 
 
Turkish Operations against the PKK Continue Inside Turkey 
All papers report that military sources say Turkish forces launched 
fresh operations against the PKK terrorists in southeastern Turkey 
on Thursday.  Military sources said thousands of soldiers were sent 
to reinforce troops in Sirnak, Hakkari and Tunceli provinces, which 
are near the Iraqi border.  The Turkish General Staff (TGS) said 11 
terrorists were killed this week in clashes on Gabar and Kupeli

mountains in Sirnak.  18 suspects have been detained in 
counter-terror operations in four provinces. Turkish security forces 
have initiated operations to capture 80 more terrorists hiding in 
the region.  The TGS also said four PKK surrendered in Silopi, a 
town in the southeastern province of Sirnak. 
 
 
AKP's Kurdish MPs Want Amnesty for PKK, Economic Support for 
Southeast 
Liberal Radikal claims Kurdish lawmakers in the ruling AKP are 
abstaining from making open statements about the Kurdish question. 
The lawmakers await the results of today's National Security Council 
(MGK) meeting, which will discuss plans for getting the PKK to come 
down from the mountains. The Kurdish MPs believe the Turkish 
military operations alone will not solve the problem; an amnesty law 
must be passed in order to convince PKK members to surrender.  In 
addition, the Kurdish MPs feel that economic, social and cultural 
steps must be taken to develop the region. 
 
Ankara Seeking Ways to Invite Talabani to Turkey 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports the ruling AKP government has 
decided to invite Iraqi President Jalal Talabani to Turkey during 
the first quarter of 2008.  The Turkish government is waiting for a 
"suitable time" to extend an invitation to the Iraqi President. 
 
Top Turkish Court Rejects Measures against Pro-Kurdish DTP 
All papers report the Constitutional Court rejected the public 
prosecutor's demand for precautionary measures against the 
pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP).  The prosecutor wanted 
the DTP barred from elections, prevented from enrolling new members, 
and deprived of Treasury assistance.  The court's decision stated 
that the conditions for such precautionary measures "have not 
materialized."  DTP board member Nursel Aydogan said the 
Constitutional Court "prevented a legal scandal" by rejecting the 
measures. 
 
Meanwhile, DTP lawmakers, mayors, and party activists will hold a 
news conference in parliament to denounce the jailing of their party 
leader Nurettin Demirtas.  Demirtas was charged with fraud after 
evidence emerged that he falsely claimed he had tuberculosis in 
order to avoid military service. 
 
New Years' Celebrations Cancelled in Istanbul 
All papers report that the Kadikoy Municipality in Istanbul, 
Turkey's largest city, has cancelled New Year's Eve celebrations due 
to security concerns.  On Wednesday, the greater Istanbul 
Municipality cancelled celebrations scheduled for Taksim Square.
