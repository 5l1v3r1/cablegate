In Today's Papers 
 
Turkish Forces Destroy PKK Camps in Zap and Move Toward Mount 
Qandil 
All papers report Turkey's Military General Staff (TGS) said on 
Monday the PKK death toll has reached 153 during the ground 
offensive into northern Iraq.  TGS also said two more Turkish 
soldiers were killed in fighting, which brings the total Turkish 
military fatalities since the start of the incursion to 17. 
Mainstream papers Milliyet and Vatan, leftist-nationalist 
Cumhuriyet, and Islamist-oriented Zaman say the Zap camp was 
destroyed.  This is a significant victory for Turkish forces because 
the Zap camp served as the logistical support headquarters of the 
PKK.  Zaman, Yeni Safak, and Cumhuriyet report that Turkish troops 
headed toward Mount Qandil after they destroyed the PKK camps in 
Cemco, Avasin, Hakurk, and Zap on Monday.  Yeni Safak and Cumhuriyet 
claim Turkish troops control an area 25-50 km from the border. 
 
Government spokesman Cemil Cicek told the press yesterday the 
operations target the PKK, not the Kurdish administration of 
northern Iraq.  "Turkish troops will return home when their mission 
is accomplished," said Cicek. On Monday, President Abdullah Gul and 
Prime Minister Erdogan were briefed by TGS on the latest 
developments regarding the ground offensive in northern Iraq.  Gul 
postponed his four-day trip to Africa due to the ongoing Turkish 
operations in northern Iraq.  On Wednesday, a Turkish delegation 
comprised of Turkish Foreign Ministry officials and TGS officials 
will travel to Baghdad to explain to the Sunni, Shia, and Kurdish 
groups the "aim and scope" of the Turkish land offensive in northern 
Iraq. 
 
On Thursday, funerals for soldiers killed in operations in northern 
Iraq were held in Ankara, Kayseri, Hatay, and Ardahan.  President 
Gul, Parliament Speaker Toptan, PM Erdogan, TGS Chief Buyukanit, and 
several other cabinet ministers attended the funerals. 
 
Papers also report around 10,000 people gathered in the southeastern 
city of Diyarbakir in a rally initiated by the pro-Kurdish DTP to 
protest the Turkish ground attacks in northern Iraq.  DTP lawmakers 
Selahattin Demirtas and Aysel Tugluk attended the rally, along with 
Mayor Osman Baydemir.  Former Kurdish MP Leyla Zana spoke at the 
rally and called for the establishment of a "democratic and 
autonomous Kurdistan," and called on the Turkish state officials to 
"talk to the PKK's imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan" to resolve the 
Kurdish question.  "Give us freedom or death," Zana said, calling 
for an end to the operations in northern Iraq.  Riot police 
dispersed the crowd by using batons and pepper spray. 
 
On the other hand, papers report White House Spokesperson Dana 
Perino said the US hopes Turkey's operations in northern Iraq will 
be "short" and "will not harm civilians" 
 
 
Editorial Commentary on Kurdish Problem, Turkish Operations in 
Northern Iraq 
 
"There Is No Comprehensive Package" 
Murat Yetkin is pro-American and a respected international affairs 
analyst. 
He wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal (2/26): 
"Justice Minister Sahin categorically denied reports that the AKP 
government is preparing a comprehensive package to address the 
Kurdish issue.  In fact, it's easy to draw conclusions based on the 
assessments of sources close to Prime Minister and the public 
remarks from the Justice Minister.  Currently, Ankara is completely 
focused on the military operation and hopes to see the PKK's 
capacity destroyed.  In addition, the ruling AKP is exerting efforts 
in hopes that Turkey's southeastern provinces, traditionally 
controlled by pro-Kurdish parties, will become strongholds for the 
AKP during the upcoming local elections.  Because of these two

issues, it is not realistic to expect the government to propose a 
series of cultural, political and economic measures in order to 
solve the Kurdish issue.  It seems this situation will change only 
if the military operations result in a significant blow against the 
PKK's ability to operate as a formidable threat." 
 
"Operation Sun" 
Derya Sazak is a senior columnist and ombudsman for mainstream 
Milliyet.  He is a liberal, but is skeptical about US plans for the 
region, particularly in Iraq. 
He wrote in mainstream Milliyet (2/26): 
 "Despite the ongoing 'Operation Sun' land operation, there is a 
significant need to bring political and peaceful solutions to the 
agenda.  The Kurdish problem has resulted in the loss of 40,000 
lives during the last 25 years.  Despite Turkey's demonstrated 
military supremacy, the Kurdish problem remains.  Thus, the solution 
must include alternatives outside of military action.  For example, 
the formation of a new parliament with representation from 
pro-Kurdish parties may provide hope for improved understanding and 
thus may render the PKK ineffective.  While the cross border 
operation continues with support from the US, Turkey, once again, is 
looking for a Kurdish solution outside of Turkey and inside northern 
Iraq.  Even though the PKK has suffered from heavy losses, we have 
also lost 15 of our soldiers in only four days.  Attending martyred 
soldiers' funerals is not enough to solve the problem.  Ankara must 
bring a political plan to the parliament's attention." 
 
'Headscarf Ambiguity' Creates Divisions in Universities 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Taraf, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and 
others report the ruling AKP government's decision to remove a ban 
on the headscarf in universities has split the Higher Education 
Board (YOK) into two sides.  On Sunday, YOK Chairman Yusuf Ziya 
Ozcan issued a written directive instructing all university rectors 
to allow students wearing headscarves to attend classes.  Nine 
rectors, who are also members of the YOK board, criticized Professor 
Ozcan for backing the AKP government's view that the constitutional 
changes have lifted the ban on headscarves in universities.  Papers 
report only 18 out of 115 universities allowed students wearing 
headscarves to enter the classroom. 
 
On Wednesday, opposition party CHP confirmed it will challenge the 
headscarf amendments in the Constitutional Court.  A fifty-page 
petition was signed by lawmakers from the CHP, the Democratic Left 
Party (DSP) and independent lawmaker Kamer Genc. 
 
"Good Morning, 301" 
Liberal Radikal reported that Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin said 
an amendment to Article 301 of Turkish Penal Code will be submitted 
to parliament as an AKP proposal.  Sahin said upper limit of 
punishment will be reduced and no punishments will be deemed 
necessary if the violation occurs outside of Turkey.  Sahin said "if 
this proposal is adopted by Turkish parliament, I will stop getting 
questions related to 301.  At the moment, the EU officials' first 
sentence after we greet them is always 'Good morning, 301?' and I am 
tired of hearing the same thing." 
 
Hopes Increase for A Settlement in Cyprus 
Sabah, Vatan, Zaman, Aksam, Cumhuriyet, Milliyet and others:  Papers 
report that the Christofias' victory in the Greek Cypriot 
presidential elections has opened a new era for Cyprus.  Mainstream 
Sabah says Christofias already requested an appointment from the UN 
to arrange talks with Turkish Cypriot President Talat.  Mainstream 
Vatan says that world leaders are encouraging Christofias to seek a 
settlement in Cyprus.  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet draws 
attention to the words of KKTC President Talat that a settlement 
could be worked out by the end of the year.  Islamist-oriented Zaman 
is more skeptical about Christofias' remarks and says that "the 
Greek Cypriot leader gives emphasis to talks, not to settlement."
