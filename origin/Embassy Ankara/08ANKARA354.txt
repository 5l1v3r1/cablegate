¶1. (SBU) Turkish ground operations in the Zap-Metina area of 
northern Iraq continue, with Turkish troops supported by 
artillery and air strikes as well as helicopter gunships. 
Weather in the objective area is expected to deteriorate 
significantly over the next 24-48 hours, limiting air 
operations.  Commercial and sustainment vehicle traffic at 
the Habur Gate crossing between Turkey and Iraq remains at 
normal levels.  President Gul received a briefing at the 
Turkish General Staff (TGS) on the ongoing operations on 
February 25. 
 
¶2. (U) TGS reported on February 24 that Turkish troops 
continue to engage in close combat and continue to destroy 
PKK shelters, weapons, ammunition, and supplies.  According 
to the TGS, a total of 112 PKK terrorists, including 
leadership figures, have been killed in fighting as of 
February 24.  Eight Turkish troops were reported killed on 
February 24.  A TGS announcement claimed that the PKK are 
booby-trapping the bodies of dead PKK terrorists in order to 
cause casualties among Turkish forces.  The Turkish military 
is investigating the crash of one of its helicopters in the 
border region.  The announcement also alleges that the 
military pressure is causing infighting and fratricide among 
PKK members. 
 
¶3. (U) Turkish newspapers continue to speculate on the size, 
scope, and duration of the ground operation.  Ercan Citlioglu 
speculates in mainstream Sabah that the land operation will 
continue for two months and Turkish units will return to 
Turkey in April.  He adds that "The U.S. has not voiced 
objections to the Turkish operations and this shows that the 
process of liquidating Masoud Barzani has begun."  Meanwhile, 
Enis Berberoglu writes in mainstream Hurriyet that the number 
of Turkish combat troops in northern Iraq was limited to a 
few thousand, indicating the operation would be short in 
scope and duration.  Murat Yetkin writes in liberal Radikal 
that the ground operations initiated last week proves that 
the U.S. is serious about helping Turkey against the PKK. 
Kemalist Cumhuriyet asserts that the Turkish army will 
advance 50 kilometers into Iraq and Istanbul's Kanal 7 TV is 
reporting that elite Turkish troops have already landed at 
the PKK's Qandil mountain redoubt.  Turkish papers have also 
picked up stories from Kurdish media alleging that 70 U.S. 
Army tanks and HUMMVs are moving towards Dohuk, while a 
Peshmerga spokesperson has denied that story. 
 
¶4. (U) According to mainstream Hurriyet, Turkish business 
groups support the ground operation.  While they anticipate 
it may slow trade with Iraq in the short term, they believe 
that improved security will benefit Turkey-Iraq trade over 
the longer term. 
 
¶5. (U) Turkish media are also reporting that U.S. Defense 
Secretary Gates, scheduled to visit Ankara February 27-28, 
 
SIPDIS 
stated that the operation should be kept short and urged the 
Turkish government to adopt political and economic measures 
to keep the PKK from winning the support of Turkey's Kurdish 
population.   Columnists across the political spectrum 
continue to point out that cross-border operations alone will 
not solve the problem and urge the government to undertake 
comprehensive political, economic, and social measures to 
address the Kurdish issue, including 24-hour Kurdish language 
broadcasting.
