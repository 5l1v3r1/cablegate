SUBJECT: TURKISH MEDIA REACTION 
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2009 
 
Media Highlights: IMF Protests in Istanbul; Geithner Says US Key to 
Crisis; Armenia Diaspora Protests; Iran Missed Lessons; Democratic 
Initiative Dents AKP Support; Erdogan vs. Dogan Media --"We are not 
Al Capone" 
 
IMF Protests in Istanbul:  All TV channels mesmerized by live 
coverage Tuesday morning of IMF protests in Istanbul. CNN Turk 
reports that riot police dispersed some 5,000 anti-globalization 
protestors when they tried to march on the convention center where 
the IMF-World Bank meetings are being held.  Bystanders were 
affected when police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the 
group. 
 
Geithner: "The Way Out for Crisis Depends On US." 
Mainstream Hurriyet carries an interview with the US Secretary of 
Treasury Tim Geithner during the World Bank-IMF annual meetings in 
Istanbul.  The paper notes, "Secretary Geithner said in a realistic 
manner that it's US' responsibility for the economic crisis and that 
the US is working hard for the recovery."  He also emphasized "how 
dramatically the US stance on major problems has changed during 
post-Bush period."   IMF's role, the future of the USD and G-20 were 
among the topics discussed in the interview. 
 
Armenia:  Diaspora Protests Reconciliation Efforts and Sargsian 
Tour 
Mainstream Sabah, Vatan, Hurriyet widely cover protests against 
Armenian President Sargsian in Los Angeles yesterday.  In "Diaspora 
Fury Prevents Bern" Hurriyet opines that mass protests in the U.S. 
prevented an official announcement of the Zurich Turkey-Armenia 
protocols signing that was widely expected yesterday from Bern. 
Papers note that 12,000 people protested the Turkey-Armenia protocol 
signing and Sargsian's goodwill trip to explain the Turkish-Armenia 
normalization process to the Armenia diaspora in the US. 
Nevertheless, media reported that both foreign ministers - Davutoglu 
and Nalbandian - claimed no change of plans and predicted that the 
protocols will be signed in Zurich on October 10. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkey-Armenia and the Kurdish Democratic 
Initiative 
 
Hurriyet's Ertugrul Ozkok gives strong support for the normalization 
process: "Just like how the Armenian president was booed in the 
U.S., similar things will happen to Turkey's PM as well but none of 
these should discourage the normalization process.  Political 
courage is the right path to pursue for progress in democracies." 
Similar encouragement also came from Yavuz Donat (mainstream Sabah): 
"The presidency is making every preparation based on the assumption 
that the Armenian president will come even though it is not yet 
officially announced." 
 
Regarding the government's Kurdish initiative, pundits have begun 
expressing regret over the DTP's "uncompromising" approach.  In 
Islamist oriented Yeni Safak, Ali Bayramoglu called on the DTP to 
change its rhetoric "otherwise the benchmarks for success of the 
government's democratic initiative will have to be lowered 
significantly."  In liberal Radikal, Murat Yetkin talks about the 
possibility of a backfire for the government since DTP is not 
softening its position: "Given the current parameters, this 
democratic initiative may not be advantageous for the government at 
the end of the day.  It remains to be seen whether PM Erdogan has a 
contingency plan against this possibility." 
 
Iran:  Missed Lessons 
The Turkish press continues to comment on the aftermath of P5+1 
talks.  In "Lessons Not Taken From Iran" mainstream Hurriyet 
columnist Mehmet Yilmaz regrets that in the US "the mistake of Iraq 
is now being repeated" with another mistake on Iran: "There is 
ongoing psychological warfare in the American press about Iran. 
This demonstrates that no lesson was taken from the Iraq mistake and 
public opinion is now being shaped negatively on Iran."

Democratic Initiative Dents AKP votes in west, increases in east 
Mainstream Milliyet carries on its front page a survey conducted by 
Pollmark company, which canvassed the views of 1500 people on the 
GOT's 'democratic initiative' regarding the Kurdish minority. 
According to the survey, 48 percent of those interviewed support the 
initiative, while 35 percent oppose and 17 percent are indecisive. 
In addition, eighty percent of AK Party supporters, 45 percent of 
CHP supporters and 25 to 30 percent of MHP supporters support the 
initiative.  The poll shows that the initiative pulled the AK 
Party's votes in the Aegean, Mediterranean and Western Marmara 
regions down 3 to 5 points but increased it in the eastern parts of 
the country by 20 percent. 
 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet and mainstream Aksam carry a survey 
conducted by the "Wise Men Strategic Research Center," (Bilgesam) 
with 8607 Kurdish-origin Turks in 17 eastern and southeastern 
provinces.  In response to whether Kurds should be given 
independence, 90.3 percent of the respondents said "No," and only 
9.7 said "Yes."  On whether the PKK's imprisoned leader Ocalan 
should be released, 35.31 percent approved while 74.7 percent 
opposed.  One out of every three respondents "trust" the Kurdish DTP 
while one out of every six trust the PKK.  The poll also shows 67.6 
percent of the respondents said they trust the state. 
 
Dogan Holding: Files Injunction Requests and Says "We Are Not Al 
Capone!" 
HaberTurk reports that Dogan Media Group has filed five law suits 
for the injunction of both the TRY3.7bn tax fine and the TRY4.8bn 
collateral assessment.   According to the daily, Dogan Group applied 
to the Istanbul Tax Court with the five different cases in order to 
head-off Friday's deadline for payment of the collateral fine.  If 
the court does not place an injunction on this deadline, the Tax 
Office may apply for a temporary order to seize Dogan Group's assets 
up to the amount of the lawsuit until the case is resolved. 
 
Meanwhile, Dogan Media Holding issued a written statement by email 
late on Oct. 5 that expresses grave concern about PM Erdogan's 
analogy between Al Capone and Aydin Dogan made in an interview with 
the Wall Street Journal.  The WSJ said that PM Erdogan defended his 
government's crippling $3.2 billion additional demand in fines and 
penalties against the country's largest media business, comparing 
the case with the U.S. pursuit of gangster Al Capone on tax-evasion 
charges in the 1930s.  WSJ says that Erdogan explained that one 
reason that Turkey resisted demands from the International Monetary 
Fund to make the tax authority autonomous is because "we need to 
work hand in hand" with the tax service against the underground 
"black economy." 
 
Editorial Commentary on Aydin Dogan-Al Capone 
Columnist Ismet Berkan calls the Al Capone analogy an 'ugly 
depiction' in liberal Radikal: "PM Erdogan's entire explanation only 
indicates how much he is directly involved in the tax process and 
the fact about he is personally following every step of it.  All of 
these invalidate any argument for calling this a routine tax 
inspection case."

convene with the Iraqi cabinet for a strategic-cooperation council 
meeting in Baghdad.
