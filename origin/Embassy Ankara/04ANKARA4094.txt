SUBJECT: EXBS:  U.S. COMMENTS ON NP COOPERATION AND 
ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 156979 
 
¶1. Post delivered the U.S.text of the EXBS agreement and 
reftel talking points to the MFA on July 20.  MFA Acting DDG 
for Disarmament Bulent Meric agreed to consider the two 
proposed changes to the last Turkish draft. 
 
¶2. Meric did not evince significant concern with the change 
in Article 3, since the GOT will still be able to assess the 
reasonableness of any request. However, regarding the 
additional point in Article 5, Meric said a perpetual clause 
in an international agreement was not possible under Turkish 
law. We emphasized that this point was required by our 
government for all grants to foreign governments and that 
without it goods or services could not be delivered. We 
pointed out that without this over-arching clause, each 
individual contractual grant agreement will need to contain 
this provision.  We compared this to the third-country 
assurances the USG requires when providing military equipment 
and encouraged Meric to look at this precedent when 
considering the Article 5 proposal. 
 
¶3. Meric said he would consult with the relevant officers and 
agencies and would respond to Post as soon as all comments 
were received.
