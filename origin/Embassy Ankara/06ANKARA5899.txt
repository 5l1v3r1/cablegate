about pet food and biotechnology legislation. Deputy Undersecretary 
Ferhat Shelli also attended.  End Summary.

¶2.  (SBU) At an October 10 courtesy call by newly-arrived AgCouns, 
Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) Mehdi Eker 
expressed his thanks to USDA for hosting him in Washington last 
month.  Pointing out that it has been 25 years since a U.S. 
Secretary of Agriculture has visited Turkey, he said he looks 
 
SIPDIS 
forward to a reciprocal visit to Turkey by Secretary Johanns, hoping 
it would include the signing of an MOU on agricultural cooperation. 
He repeated that he had invited U.S. Agriculture Secretary Johanns 
to visit Turkey and that he understood that Secretary Johanns had 
accepted the invitation.

Minister's Comments on Avian Influenza 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Minister Eker stated that MARA is preparing for the 
migratory season and is working very closely with the Ministry of 
Health.  He said that his government is creating a national 
communication plan to respond to expected outbreaks of AI.  Agcouns 
offered assistance if the Ministry wished to find an outside expert 
on risk communication. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Agcouns informed the Minister that the Ambassador had 
expressed an interest in Turkey's potential as a regional leader in 
managing AI.  Minister Eker agreed, replying that he would like 
Turkey to continue to expand its position as a regional role model. 
He said he would direct his staff to coordinate with the Ministry of 
Health and international organizations such as FAO and WHO to 
organize an international seminar on coordinating efforts to prepare 
for and handle the next avian influenza crisis.  Because AI is a 
trans-boundary disease and a global issue, he said he hoped not only 
Turkey's neighbors, but also North African and Central Asian 
countries, Russia, Ukraine and Israel could attend. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Agcouns asked Minister Eker if he would be willing to host 
a signing ceremony for the $1 million USAID grant for avian 
influenza activities.  Minister Eker said that he would be happy to 
host such a ceremony.  He replied favorably to a suggested November 
7 date. (Note: FAS will coordinate to finalize date).

Minister's Comments on Other Agricultural Issues 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶6. (SBU) PET FOOD: Agcouns thanked the Minister for his staff's 
efforts in resolving the pet food dioxin certification issue.  Both 
Minister Eker and DUS Shelli confirmed that a letter had been sent 
last week instructing Provincial Directorate offices that U.S. pet 
food shipments no longer were required to have additional dioxin 
certification.  Shelli said an official letter with this information 
would be sent to Embassy very soon (Note: After the meeting FAS 
received a fax copy of this letter, which has been forwarded to 
Washington agencies). 
 
¶7. (SBU) BIOTECHNOLOGY: Minister Eker confirmed rumors that a new 
draft Biosafety Law was circulating at a high level.  (Comment: 
Post is making attempts to obtain an advance copy of this draft) He 
added that a new Seed Law, closely linked with the draft 
biotechnology law, will be voted on in Parliament by next week. 
 
¶8. (SBU) GSM-102 AND OTHER ASSISTANCE: Agcouns shared with the 
Minister the October 6 USDA press release announcing the FY 07 
GSM-102 program and briefly explained its benefits to Turkey. 
Agcouns also mentioned that USDA hoped to work closely with the 
Ministry to decide how best to provide technical assistance to 
improve the competitiveness of Turkish agriculture, as increased 
competitiveness would reduce protectionist resistance to market 
opening.  Minister Eker expressed his thanks and willingness to 
cooperate.
