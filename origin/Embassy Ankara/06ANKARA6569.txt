¶1.  (SBU) The Turkish MFA confirms that Energy Minister Hilmi 
Guler has agreed to participate in an 
Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey meeting on natural gas in Tbilisi 
on December 8 (refs). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On November 22, Undersecretary Sami Demirbilek 
reiterated to us Turkey's willingness to help Georgia with 
gas for this winter, as agreed by Prime Minister Erdogan 
during the BTC events in July.  He stressed that Turkey was 
waiting for Azerbaijan to decide what it wanted to do and 
then for Azerbaijan and Georgia to strike an arrangment. 
Once this was agreed between Georgia and Azerbaijan, he 
thought it would be relatively easily to devise a formula 
that would make Turkey "whole" by agreement to postpone 
delivery of contracted Shah Deniz volumes at the reduced 
price to future years.  He endorsed Statoil's proposition of 
a two step process: first political agreement, then 
implementation of the commercial arrangements. 
Fundamentally, however, Demirbilek said the BP-led consortium 
was having problems with the new gas wells and questioned 
whether or not Shah Deniz gas was available at all for export.
