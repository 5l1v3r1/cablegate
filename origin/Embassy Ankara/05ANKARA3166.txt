¶1.  Further to ref A and C demarches, Turkish MFA Head of 
Multilateral Economic Affairs Department Arar wrote the 
following in an email to Poloff: "We know the reasons behind 
the US position on the regular budget of the ILO.  However it 
is difficult to support you on on this subject either, as the 
increase forseen in the budget will not lead to an overall 
increase in the countries' contribution levels.  In addition, 
the general feeling is for the increase.  The US is providing 
some 20 plus percent of the 'technical budget' of the ILO. 
If you want to make cuts, you can do it there.  In this case 
nobody will challenge you." 
 
¶2.  Further to ref B and C demarches, Mr. Arar wrote:  "As I 
told you, we have already promised Cuba our support through a 
mutual support agreement.  We cannot come back on our 
position on this issue."
