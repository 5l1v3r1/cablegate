In Today's Papers 
 
President Gul Continues Talks in the US 
All papers report President Abdullah Gul met with UNSYG Ban Ki-Moon 
in New York in order to lobby for a new Cyprus initiative in 2008. 
Gul stressed the Turkish Cypriots will continue to back efforts for 
a UN-sponsored settlement.  Ki-Moon said he wanted to wait for the 
presidential elections in south Cyprus before launching new 
intitiatives.  Turkish papers believe hopes for a settlement will 
fade away if Greek Cypriot leader Tassos Papadopoulos wins another 
term in office.  Gul and Ban also discussed the situation in the 
northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, with Gul urging the UN to 
"facilitate" efforts to grant the oil-rich city a special status. 
 
In New York on Thursday, Gul met international investors at the St. 
Regis Hotel to discuss Turkey's privatization, EU accession, and 
social security reform.  Gul stressed the reform process in Turkey 
would continue.  He later met with Henry Kissinger for 45 minutes. 
The meeting was closed to press. 
 
On Thursday evening, Gul was interviewed on CNN-International where 
he said Turkish military operations into northern Iraq would 
continue as long as the PKK used the region as a safe haven.  He 
suggested there should be a timetable for withdrawal of US troops 
from Iraq and that diplomatic efforts with Iran be doubled. 
 
Erdogan Unveils Government Action Plan 
All papers report Prime Minister Erdogan Thursday announced the AKP 
government's "Action Plan."  Erdogan said the goal of the program 
was to complete the "social restoration process" in Turkey.  Liberal 
Radikal says the new plan was not a concrete action plan but 
"wishful thinking."  Islamist-oriented Zaman says the plan's 
priorities will create new jobs, promote democratization, initiate a 
new constitution, and support EU accession.  According to the plan, 
state incentives for farmers will end, the Southeastern Anatolia 
Project (GAP) will be completed in four or five years, and new 
universities will be established in nine provinces.  Erdogan noted 
the state will no longer extend direct subsidies; rather state 
support will be based on production.  He also announced the 
headquarters of Central Bank and the state-owned Ziraatbank, 
Halkbank, and Vakifbank will be moved to Istanbul.  Erdogan also 
stressed privatization sales will continue, tax legislation will be 
simplified, and the floating exchange rate regime will remain in 
place. 
He said at least 10 more diplomatic missions are to be opened in 
African countries.  The PM also noted the draft constitution would 
be made public in a few weeks. 
 
Bomb Attack in Diyarbakir Divides the PKK 
Vatan, Milliyet, Sabah, Zaman, Cumhuriyet and others:  Mainstream 
Milliyet speculates that the Diyarbakir attack divided the PKK.  The 
executive council presidency of the PKK issued a statement saying 
"the issue concerning the Diyarbakir attack is complicated." 
Meanwhile, the military council of the PKK called the Diyarbakir 
unit of the organization back to northern Iraq.  The bombing in 
Diyarbakir revealed the internal unrest in the terrorist 
organization.  Vatan reports that the January 3 bombing led 
residents of the city, who have been afraid to voice reactions to 
PKK terror for years, to begin to criticize the PKK.  Even the 
mainly Kurdish party DTP reacted to the bomb attack harshly. 
 
Meanwhile, a group of 200 NGO representatives held a 'silent march' 
in Diyarbakir yesterday under the leadership of the local Bar 
Association to condemn the January 3 attack in Diyarbakir. 
 
Controversial Alevi Dinner 
All papers report that the controversy surrounding an Alevi Iftar 
dinner organized by an AKP parliamentarian is growing.  None of the 
prominent Alevi organizations are supporting this Iftar dinner.  The 
spokesman of the Alevi Associations Federation Metin Tarhan issued a 
 
ANKARA 00000062  002 OF 003 
 
 
written statement saying that there are 279 Alevi organizations in 
Turkey and that only eight of them will attend the Iftar. 
Islamist-oriented Zaman reports that PM Erdogan and 14 of his 
Ministers will attend the dinner at Ankara's Bilkent Hotel tonight. 
During his opening remarks, the PM is expected to comment on the 
problems faced by Alevis.  Mainstream Sabah says the dinner caused 
disagreements among Alevis and Alevi leaders have threatened to 
excommunicate those who attend the dinner.  Liberal Radikal reports 
that the senior Alevi leaders are objecting to the dinner by saying 
'the goal of the dinner is to weaken the secular, republican, 
non-racist and non-fundamentalist stance of Alevis.' 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: US-Turkey 
 
"Political Solution; What Is That?" 
Fehmi Koru opined in Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak (1/11): 
"Ambassador Wilson's statement that 'Turkish and American leaders 
did not discuss a political solution to the PKK' is very important. 
Ambassador Wilson is aware of sensitivities in Turkey and the 
differences in jargons, so he decided to conclude this controversy 
with his comment.  However, statements by other US officials 
confused the situation. Both Dana Perino and an unnamed White House 
official talked about a long-term solution which includes a 
political solution.  The fact of the matter is that the fight 
against terrorism is very complicated.  In addition to military 
measures, Turkey has to take economic, social and political steps 
for the sake of its security, welfare and safety.  Economic and 
social measures always pave the way for talks about political 
changes.  In America, such steps can be considered part of a 
political solution but Turkey views the term "political solution" as 
sharp-edged. Turkey is going through a period of learning how to 
solve its own problems as it gets rids of terrorism." 
 
"Political Solution: No Room for Optimism" 
Cengiz Candar wrote in business and political daily Referans (1/11): 
"Evidently the US is looking for a political solution to Turkey's 
Kurdish problem.  In this context, Washington prefers to see Turkey 
engage in dialogue and cooperation with the Iraqi Kurdish 
leadership.  Turkish President Gul categorically denied the stories 
he and Bush discussed a 'political solution' to the PKK because he 
was afraid it would come back to haunt him in domestic politics.  In 
fact, what is wrong with discussing a political solution to the 
Kurdish issue at the White House?  Some circles, rather 
optimistically, are waiting to see political steps taken by 
President Gul and PM Erdogan, because they believe that current 
Turkish leadership will act realistically.  I can speak for myself 
because I will not join the circle of optimism.  I do not see any 
serious indication of the Turkish leadership's preparation for a 
comprehensive solution.  The traditional approach treats this 
problem with economic development.  Unless we treat the Kurdish 
problem as an identity issue and unless we take action with 
strategic vision as well as political decisiveness, there is no room 
for optimism."
