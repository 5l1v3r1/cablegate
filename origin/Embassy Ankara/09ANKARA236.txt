¶1. (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Per reftel instructions, Emboffs contacted the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) and Foreign 
Trade Undersecretariat (FTU).  The Directorate of 
Agricultural Research at MARA, which has been the lead agency 
on CBD-related matters, said that Turkey would not be sending 
a delegation to the meeting in Mexico.  FTU officials 
confirmed the same and noted that they had not even been made 
aware of the meeting.  Post considers it likely that the EU 
will speak on behalf of Turkey, as it did in the May 2008 
meeting in Bonn.
