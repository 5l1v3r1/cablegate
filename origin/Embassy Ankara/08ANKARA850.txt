Ref: U.S.-TURKEY 2008 EPC DISCUSSIONS 
 
¶1. Turkey will host its Third Iraq International Fair in the 
southeastern city of Gaziantep May 22 - 25.  This trade fair is 
jointly organized by the Iraqi Ministry of Trade and the Turkish 
Foreign Trade Undersecretariat (FTU) and will include exhibitors 
from Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Italy, Russia, Taiwan, France, Iran, 
Poland, China, Saudi Arabia and others from the region.  Sectors of 
interest to the Iraqis include construction and housing; agriculture 
and environment; communications; education; energy and utilities; 
healthcare; information technology; oil and gas; security; 
transport; and water and wastewater. 
 
¶2. During the April 2008 U.S.-Turkey EPC, Turkey and the U.S. agreed 
to support regional trade events focusing on Iraqi development and 
reconstruction.  The Gaziantep Iraq International Fair was 
specifically mentioned as one upcoming event.  Our PRTs in Babil and 
Najaf and Embassy Baghdad have been coordinating with Iraqi 
companies and hope to accompany approximately 100 Iraqi business 
people to the event, and Turkey expects as many as 3000 Iraqi 
business people to attend overall.  2007's fair attracted over 
50,000 attendees and included 902 exhibitors from 30 countries. 
 
¶3. I strongly encourage U.S. participation at this event and our 
support for it.  This is one of the only fairs officially sanctioned 
by the Iraqi Government and provides an opportunity to encourage 
strengthened Turkish-Iraqi cooperation and, on a practical level, to 
foster U.S.-Turkish business collaboration in this key third-country 
market -- an issue that was also discussed at the EPC.  The 
organizers have provided the USG with a small booth free of charge 
that our Consulate in Adana will staff on the opening day.  We 
should also have an FCS Baghdad or other appropriate trade promotion 
representation presence.  I have been asked by both FTU and the 
Prime Minister's office to participate and am considering this, as 
well. 
 
¶4. Looking ahead, we understand that FCS is considering officially 
supporting the 2009 event, which would include recruiting U.S. 
companies to exhibit at the fair and possibly hosting a U.S. 
pavilion.  I strongly support this and believe that FCS Iraq 
participation this year would provide an opportunity to better 
understand the event and market it in the future to U.S. companies. 
I hope we can give this event the USG support it deserves.
