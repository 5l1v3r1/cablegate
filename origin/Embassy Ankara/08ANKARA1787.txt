Sensitive but unclassified.  Please handle appropriately. 
 
¶1. Summary: Activities this month focused primarily on executing the 
Sept. 17-18 
Nonproliferation Seminar and making arrangements for the Customs VIP 
visit to the U.S. in November. EXBS also accompanied DOE/SLD rep to 
meetings with the Turkish national Police in support of their 
program. End Summary. 
 
¶2. Completed Actions for the Reporting Period: 
The 17-18 September Nonproliferation Seminar, co-sponsored by the 
Office of Export Control Cooperation (ISN/ECC) and the Turkish MFA, 
brought together fifteen U.S. and over thirty Turkish officials with 
 
nonproliferation, export control and border security 
responsibilities. 
Following the conclusion of the bi-lateral nonproliferation 
agreement in June 2008, the seminar provided an opportunity to 
present to the GOT interagency representatives an overview 
of the EXBS program and other  U.S. programs available to support 
bilateral nonproliferation 
cooperation. The seminar highlighted opportunities for bilateral 
cooperation 
to strengthen Turkey's nonproliferation regime. MFA Deputy Director 
General 
for Nonproliferation Ahmet Muhtar Gun welcomed the U.S. 
presentations, pledged to conduct an internal needs assessment to 
deconflict activities that Turkey is undertaking with the EU, and 
promised a GOT 
interagency-agreed response to the various areas of possible 
engagement with the U.S. 
Gun emphasized the need for timely and accurate intelligence to 
ensure effective 
coordination in cases involving sensitive shipments, and urged the 
U.S. to press 
countries of origin to do more to prevent the shipment of 
proliferation-sensitive goods.

the European Commission to Turkey, Trade Officer Arslan Umut Ergezer 
and Sector Manager Burce Ari. We discussed the latest visits paid by 
EU experts to the land border gates in eastern and western part of 
Turkey. According to draft EU assessments, most of the gates in 
eastern Turkey need major renovation and infrastructure work.  We 
requested a copy of the report but our request was declined since 
the report is considered confidential and  has not been approved by 
EU HQ in Belgium. 
 
2) Sep 12th-EXBS Advisor and Coordinator met with Deputy DG of 
Customs Enforcement Mehmet Guzel. We discussed the possible dates 
for the proposed senior Customs/Customs Enforcement delegation visit 
to the U.S. DHS/CBP HQ, National Targeting Center, Federal Law 
Enforcement Training Center, Port of Charleston, Port of San Ysidro, 
and John F. Kennedy International Airport. We agreed that the

cooperation and the handheld pager training conducted at TNP Bomb 
Disposal Unit in Golbasi.  Advisor also thanked Mr.Gultekin for 
their hospitality provided to the training team and the support 
provided by his office during the training.  Mr.Gultekin requested 
to have the same training for the remainder of the bomb disposal 
specialists and asked about the possibility of providing additional 
pagers, survey meters and radiation isotope identifiers.  Deschler 
stated that they were ready to provide more equipment and the 
training for the remainder of the specialists and offered to provide 
two mobile detection proto type vans to enhance the capacity of TNP 
for radiation detection.  Mr.Gultekin stated TNP was ready to accept 
the first two vans, test them, and later decide on a possible 
request for additional vans. He also asked whether any formal 
agreement or letter is required to accept the two proto type van 
donations.  Deschler responded that for the first two vans, it was 
not necessary but for the additional equipment some type of letter 
of acceptance but not an agreement may be required. 
 
4) Sep 19th-Since the Bomb Disposal Unit is under the TNP 
Laboratory, the same team met with TNP Criminal Police Laboratory 
Head of Department Seyit Demirci and Deputy of Head of Bomb Disposal 
Unit Kambi Apaydin.  We were told that they were very satisfied with 
the training provided by Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) training 
team and they plan to include this training in their curriculums. 
Mr. Apaydin stated that they would like to continue cooperation 
under SLD program and they could start the process for two radiation 
detection vans.  He also inquired about possible HAZMAT training for 
the TNP officers. Advisor responded that the earliest possibility 
for HAZMAT training was early spring of 2009. Mr.Deschler provided
