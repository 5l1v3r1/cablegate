Summary 
------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a September 17 meeting with State Minister 
Kursad Tuzmen, the Ambassador raised intellectual 
property rights, barriers to importing distilled 
spirits and rice (septel), scheduling a Trade and 
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) meeting and 
trucker security in Iraq (septel).  Tuzmen raised 
Turkish automaker Tofas' desire to purchase a General 
Motors powertrain assembly line with the aim of 
exporting powertrains to Iran.  End Summary. 
 
IPR 
--- 
 
¶3. (U) The Ambassador noted that the U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Office and the Turkish Ministry of Justice 
had jointly organized a successful conference on IPR 
enforcement the previous week.  He urged that Turkish 
companies, particularly apparel firms for which 
trademarks/brand recognition are increasingly important 
in Turkey and abroad, see IPR protection as a priority. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Ambassador raised lack of data exclusivity 
protection for pharmaceuticals companies as an area in 
which Turkey is not carrying out its WTO TRIPS 
obligations.  This was the leading U.S. concern 
motivating a decision to elevate Turkey to Priority 
Watch List status in this year's Special 301 process. 
The Ambassador added that lack of data exclusivity, 
along with other problems facing research-based 
companies, could force those firms to choose not to 
release innovative drugs in Turkey, with a major impact 
on health care. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Tuzmen responded that the Special 301 decision 
was unjustified, and that Turkey applied strong 
standards in IPR. 
 
Regional Trade 
-------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Tuzmen noted Turkey's interest in expanding 
trade with neighboring countries, and in this 
connection raised Turkish automaker Tofas' desire to 
purchase a General Motors powertrain assembly line with 
the aim of exporting powertrains to Iran. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Ambassador responded that we understand 
Turkey's desire to export more to neighboring 
countries, and that, with respect to Iraq, we fully 
support Turkey's aspirations.  He noted that with 
regard to Syria and Iran, the situation was more 
complex.  The U.S. had concerns about the policies 
pursued by both countries and U.S. sanctions on Syria 
and Iran were in place as the Minister was well aware. 
The Ambassador stated that the Embassy would check the 
status of GM's application to the U.S. Treasury for 
permission to sell the equipment to TOFAS, and provide 
an update to the Foreign Trade Undersecretariat. 
 
TIFA 
---- 
 
¶8. (U) The Ambassador told Tuzmen that we view the TIFA 
as a useful vehicle for discussing these and other 
trade and investment issues with Turkey, and noted that 
the Foreign Trade Undersecretary (FTU) had not made a 
concrete counterproposal to our proposed date in 
October.  Tuzmen responded that FTU Kayalar's calendar 
is packed for the next several months, and suggested 
that a TIFA could be held sometime in January or 
February 2005. 
 
¶9. (U) Action Request:  Please advise current status of 
GM's application to Treasury on the TOFAS case.
