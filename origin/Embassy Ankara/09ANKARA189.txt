In Today's Papers 
 
Chador Fails for CHP, New Hope in Quran Classes (Vatan) 
Sabah, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Zaman, Radikal, Cumhuriyet:  Chadored 
women members of the main opposition party CHP resigned from the 
party on Wednesday after party leaders refused to nominate the 
wmoens' preferred candidate for Mayor in Istanbul's Eyup district. 
Realizing that the chador failed to work out for his party, CHP 
leader Deniz Baykal extended support Kocaeli mayoral candidate, Sefa 
Sirmen who promised Quran Courses for his district.  Baykal said the 
offering of Quran courses will prevent children from joining 
religious sects.  Liberal Radikal in a banner headline says "The CHP 
is Opening a Very Dangerous Door" and notes that reaction came from 
members of  other parties saying "Baykal is manipulating religion 
for politics." 
 
Minister Celik Protested in Van 
Mainstream Sabah and leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet report that a 
shoemaker named Cetin Isik threw a shoe at Education Minister 
Huseyin Celik while he was attending the inauguration of AKP's 
election campaign in Van.  While Celik was addressing the residents 
of Van about AKP's services to Van, Isik yelled "there are no 
services in Van" and threw a shoe at the Minister. 
 
President Gul Visits Saudi Arabia 
Media outlets report President Abdullah Gul, in Saudi Arabia on a 
state visit, on Wednesday addressed the Saudi Consultative Council, 
becoming the first Muslim leader to address the Saudi Assembly.  Gul 
said both Turkey and Saudi Arabia were working to resolve the 
biggest threat for an independent Palestinian state, i.e. the 
disagreements between the Palestinian groups.  He emphasized 
Turkey's main priority was the establishment of lasting peace and 
stability in the region. 
 
Editorial Commentary: Erdogan's 'Double-Standard' Reaction to Israel 
and Darfur 
 
Semih Idiz wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "PM Erdogan presents a 
clear double standard on human rights by strongly standing against 
Israel's Gaza operation while hosting Sudanese leaders and saying 
nothingabout Darfur.  One wonders if Erdogan's silence on Darfur 
stems from a sympathy to the Sudan regime's Islamist fundamentalist 
character." 
 
AKP Gives Families Household Goods before Municipal Elections 
Media outlets report that prior to the municipal elections in late 
March, the governor's office and seven provincial governors kicked 
off an aid campaign for distributing white household goods 
(refrigerators, washers, etc.) to 3,330 families in the eastern 
province of Tunceli.  Business daily Referans reports the ruling AKP 
governmenthad projected the municipalities' 2008 budget to be 15 
billion lira,but actually gave the municipalities 770 million extra 
lira.  The IMF is uneasy with the extra funds transferred to 
municipalities, the majority of them held by AKP mayors, on the eve 
of municipal elections, says Referans. 
 
PJAK Declared a Terrorist Organization 
Mainstream Vatan reports, "Obama Comes to Office and Work Changes," 
as "PJAK is placed on the terror list."  Vatan notes, "Obama said he 
was doing this for the protection of the Turkish people, but the 
effects of this action also signify the Obama administration's 
interest in warming relations with Iran."  CNN Turk notes, "Iranian 
security forces have also fought with PJAK forces from time to 
time."  NTV calls the move, "A PKK Message from the U.S. to Turkey," 
as "The U.S. declares the Iran wing of PKK a terrorist 
organization." 
 
'Armenian Resolution at Doorstep' (Cumhuriyet) 
Cumhuriyet, Milliyet, Hurriyet and Radikal report Mark Kirk, the 
head of Armenian caucus in the U.S. Congress, told the Armenian 
 
ANKARA 00000189  002 OF 002 
 
 
National Committee of America (ANCA) that swift action needs to be 
taken regarding the approval of Armenian genocide resolution at the 
Congress.  "Departments of State and Defense have always opposed us 
on the issue, and defended time was not right for the adoption of a 
genocide resolution, therefore it would be best if we act 
immediately," said Kirk. 
 
Editorial Commentary on AGR; Israel 
 
Hasan Cemal wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "There will be serious 
consequences if and when an Armenian genocide resolution passes from 
the Congress.  First of all, it will create a very negative impact 
on American efforts in the region.  More importantly it will give 
Turkey's nationalists and radical Islamists more power which will 
alienate Turkey from the Western club eventually." 
 
Ali Bayramoglu wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "Turkey has to 
acknowledge and cope with problems related to xenophobia and anti-. 
Turkish people's reaction to Gaza should not flow into anti-Semitic 
feelings." 
 
Russia's Military Base Game with the U.S. (Taraf) 
Mainstream Sabah reports, "Kyrgyzstan Closes a Base Used by the U.S. 
in the War in Afghanistan," after "Bakiyev announced he's reached an 
economic agreement with Russia."  CNN Turk reports, "Kyrgyz 
President Bakiyev says he will close a critical U.S. air base after 
securing a vital rescue package worth over $2 billion from Russia." 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak calls the move, "A Military Base Coup 
Against the U.S."  Leftist Taraf calls the move "Russia's Military 
Base Game with the U.S."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports, 
"Kyrgyzstan Puts the Locks on the U.S. Military Base."
