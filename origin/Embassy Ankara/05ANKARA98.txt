GIVES $1.25 MILLION 
 
REF: STATE 959 
 
¶1.  We delivered reftel points January 5 to Turkish Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Middle East Affairs Department Head 
Botsali, who is in charge of OIC-related issues.  Botsali 
noted that OIC SecGen Ihsanoglu issued an appeal on January 1 
for assistance to all OIC countries and Turkish FM Gul 
followed up the OIC appeal with a letter to all OIC FMs 
reiterating the call for assistance.  Botsali said that the 
MFA instructed Turkey's ambassadors to emphasize the OIC's 
and Gul's appeals with host governments.  Turkey has pledged 
USD 1.25 million to tsunami relief efforts.  We expressed 
appreciation for Turkey's efforts so far and emphasized the 
long-term nature of the effort needed. 
 
¶2.  We also called January 6 on Levent Senkaya of MFA's 
International Organizations Department, which has been tasked 
with the operational aspects of Turkey's tsunami victim 
relief efforts, and reiterated reftel points.  Senkaya 
reviewed the steps Turkey is taking to respond to the 
disaster and reported that Turkey is planning to host a 
meeting of the UN PermReps of OIC member states in New York 
in the coming weeks to take stock of pledges and urge OIC 
members to do more.  Turkey's NTV reported that Prime 
Minister Erdogan may travel to the disaster region later this 
month. 
 
¶3.  Senkaya said Turkey has already disbursed its $1.25 
million pledge as follows:  Indonesia - $600,000; Sri Lanka - 
$350,000; Thailand - $125,000; the Maldives - $100,000; and 
Malaysia - $75,000.  Prime Minister Erdogan issued a circular 
to all GOT entities to support fund-raising efforts in Turkey 
and among Turkish nationals abroad; and the Prime Minster's 
Office has established an account for the contributions.  The 
Turkish Red Crescent has already collected private 
contributions of nearly $1.5 million, which it will use to 
support the work of three Turkish teams already working in 
Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Thailand.
