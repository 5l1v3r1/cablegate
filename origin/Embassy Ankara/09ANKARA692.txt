IN TODAY'S PAPERS 
 
Prime Minister Erdogan Visits Baku 
All papers and TV channels:  Prior to his departure for Baku last 
night PM Erdogan told journalists at the Istanbul airport, "During 
my visit I will have the opportunity to discuss regional 
developments comprehensively.  By addressing the parliament, I will 
explain Turkey's opinions on regional and world politics.  The 
relationship between Turkey and Azerbaijan is based on very strong 
feelings of brotherhood.  There has been negative news in the media 
regarding Turkey-Azeri ties and my visit to Baku will eliminate the 
misunderstandings among the public."  He also commented on reports 
that an agreement has been reached on the Nabucco pipeline project 
by saying, "No changes have occured.  We continue to work on this 
process."  CNN Turk reported this morning that Erdogan will meet 
with Aliyev this morning at 9:45(Ankara time), followed by a joint 
press conference at 11:30, followed by Erdogan's address to the 
Azeri Parliament at 15:30.  Erdogan will depart Azerbaijan after 
President Aliyev hosts a dinner in Erdogan's honor at the 
presidential palace. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkey-Azerbaijan 
Ceyda Karan wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal: "Azerbaijan wants 
to be assured about Nagorno Karabakh and everything related to 
Turkish policy for the Caucasus.  This visit will be the time when 
PM Erdogan will do his best to comfort Azeris." 
 
Ibrahim Karagul wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "Turkey and 
Azerbaijan enjoy special ties and this relationship is unique.  PM 
Erdogan hopes to boost Baku's morale by eliminating all of the Azeri 
government's worries." 
 
President Gul's "Historic Opportunity for The Kurdish Issue" Message 
Causes Tension 
Mainstream Sabah reports that PM Erdogan responded to those who 
criticized President Gul for saying, "Good things may happen 
regarding the Kurdish issue," by saying Gul's words were "A good 
will wish."  Erdogan also asked, "Should he talk negatively?" 
However, President Gul's remarks were on the agenda of the 
opposition parties CHP and MHP during their group party meetings at 
the parliament.  Addressing his party group, CHP leader Baykal said 
"Could the historic opportunity mentioned by Gul be amnesty for PKK 
terrorists? If so, amnesty will not produce results in the fight 
against terror.  Besides, the PKK is not making any commitments to 
give up violence."  MHP leader Bahceli was harsher in his criticism. 
 He said "The President, backed by the Prime Minister, was planning 
to undertake shameful and treacherous moves.  Is the government 
expecting the opposition to give a nod to amnesty for all 
terrorists, including the jailed PKK leader in Imrali?"  Meanwhile, 
Sabah reports that DTP leader Ahmet Turk, regarding President Gul's 
remarks about solving the Kurdish issue, said, "Gul's remarks were 
promising.  Kosovo could be a good model for resolving the Kurdish 
problem in Turkey.  If whatever Turkey wanted for the Turks in 
Kosovo were granted to Kurds in Turkey, the problem would 
diminish." 
 
Editorial Commentary on Kurdish Problem 
Naci Bostanci wrote in Islamist oriented Zaman: "Solving the Kurdish 
problem is possible.  At this time it requires all political 
institutions to think outside the box." 
 
Hasan Bulent Kahraman wrote in mainstream Sabah: "Given the current 
circumstances, just as President Gul suggested, this is a good time 
to think about finding ways to end the Kurdish problem.  This is the 
time for political action." 
 
Over 12,000 Kurdish Village Names Changed Over 60 Years 
Daily Radikal carried a study about the changed names of Kurdish 
villages during 60-year period. Firat University Professor Harun 
Tuncel conducted a survey and the results indicated that in the 
 
ANKARA 00000692  002 OF 003 
 
 
60-year period between 1940 to 2000, one third of the village names 
in Turkey were changed from Kurdish to Turkish.  The survey shows a 
total of 12,211 village names were changed, in other words 35 
percent of all villages in Turkey. Most of the villages given new 
names are located in the Eastern Black Sea region, the East and the 
Southeast. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Village names 
Okay Gonensin wrote in mainstream Vatan: "It is a good development 
that we have at least started talking about the name changes in 
Turkey's provinces.  This was part of the 'Islamization of Anatolia' 
project where not only Kurdish names but also Greek and Armenian 
village names were changed.  The original names should be restored 
as soon as possible." 
 
Obama Changes Strategy from the Top in Afghanistan 
Media outlets today are explicitly stating that the former commander 
of U.S. forces in Afghanistan General McKiernan was replaced because 
of the rise in civilian deaths in U.S. operations in Afghanistan. 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports in "A 4-Star Dismissal," that, "The 
civilian deaths in Afghanistan destroyed McKiernan." 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports in "Obama Opens A New 'White' 
Page in Afghanistan," that "As civilian deaths are on the rise, 
Obama appoints a general to lead U.S. forces in Afghanistan who is 
more experienced in guerilla warfare from his service in Iraq." 
Mainstream Sabah headlines, "Obama Makes the Commander Pay the 
Bill," by "firing David McKiernan and replacing him with someone who 
has special forces experience."  Mainstream Haberturk headlines, "He 
(McKiernan) Was Fired for the Civilian Massacre." 
 
In a related story, Islamist-oriented Zaman reports in, "The 
Phosphorous Culprit in Afghanistan Remains Unknown," that, "Recently 
civilians in Afghanistan have been wounded by white phosphorous and 
girls schools have been targeted by poison gas."  Zaman says "the 
U.S. military has accused the Taliban of using white phosphorous," 
but "the Taliban has rejected these claims." 
 
The Taliban Attacks Three Girls' Schools. 
Media are largely united in condemning the Taliban's latest poison 
gas attacks on girls' schools in Afghanistan.  In "A Gas Attack on 
Girls' Schools" mainstream Hurriyet notes, "The Taliban organized a 
gas attack on three schools after theTaliban threatened schools that 
allow girls to attend."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports in 
"Gas From the Taliban to Girl Students," that "This is the third 
time the Taliban has organized attacks against elementary schools." 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports in "Hospitals Are Filled with 
Girl Students," that "The Taliban has gassed three girls' schools." 
Mainstream Haberturk reports, "The Taliban Poisoned School Girls," 
and notes, "As the Taliban gains power, they continue to terrorize 
schools that allow girls." 
 
DAS Schmierer Praises Turkey-Iraq Dialogue on the Kurdish Issue. 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports in "A U.S. Official's PKK 
Message," that U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Iraq Richard 
Schmierer told a video conference with Turkish journalists that 
"support for the terror organization (PKK) is weakening."  In "We 
Support Dialogue," liberal Radikal reports Schmierer said, "The U.S. 
is closely following developments surrounding Turkey's Kurdish 
question," and "The U.S. appreciates Turkey's willingness to 
dialogue for a settlement to the Kurdish issue."  Radikal also notes 
"Schmierer emphasized that Turkey is a strong NATO ally that will 
play an important role in Iraq's reconstruction." 
 
DAS Bryza Clarifies Karabakh Comments, Stirs Controversy in the 
Caucasus. 
 In "An American Diplomat's Karabakh Bomb," mainstream Milliyet 
reports U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matt Bryza "caused 
uproar in Yerevan" when a Russian radio channel quoted him as saying 
"Displaced Azeris will return to their homes and Karabakh will be 
given a new status."  Milliyet says that when officials in Armenia 
 
ANKARA 00000692  003 OF 003 
 
 
heard these comments, Bryza clarified that he was referring to "the 
territories around Karabakh," and the paper says "when Bryza backed 
down on the statement, he infuriated Baku."  CNN Turk reports 
"Bryza's (initial) statement was welcomed by Baku but was greeted 
with reactions in Yerevan," and later "Bryza talked on the phone 
with Armenian Foreign Minister Nalbandian" to say "I didn't say that 
Karabakh will be given to Azerbaijan."
