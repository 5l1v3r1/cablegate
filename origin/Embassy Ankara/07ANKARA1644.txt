This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶1. This is an action cable.  Please see paragraph 12. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary:  According to MFA civil aviation officials, Turkey 
is interested in supporting several of the U.S. positions at the 
upcoming ICAO General Assembly, but Turkish officials will begin to 
meet in the next few weeks to formulate positions.  MFA Civil 
Aviation Head Hamit Olcay also told us that, while Turkey will make 
its final decisions based on national interest, as a general rule it 
is best not to push Turkish officials to openly disagree or object 
to EU initiatives and positions.  He added, however, that U.S. 
policymakers should view Turkey as an ally who could help persuade 
EU officials at the meetings, and therefore he urged U.S. 
representatives at the ICAO assembly to maintain close communication 
with the Turkish delegation during the discussions.  End summary. 
 
¶3. (SBU) While Turkish civil aviation officials have not yet met to 
discuss the September 2007 ICAO General Assembly, MFA Civil Aviation 
Head Hamit Olcay gave us an overview of their initial reaction to 
our reftel requests.  Responses below are keyed to correspond with 
the specific items listed in ref A and ref B: 
 
¶4. (SBU) Universal Safety Oversight Audit Program (USOAP):  Turkish 
officials are comfortable with the general ideas expressed by the 
U.S. position, but before agreeing to cosponsor the U.S. working 
paper, Olcay asked to see a draft that he could distribute to the 
relevant Turkish officials. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST): Turkey agrees with 
the EU's reservations about making personal passenger information 
available, but policymakers are open to considering the U.S.'s 
argument.  If the argument is persuasive, Turkey could partner with 
the U.S. to try to influence EU partners. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Regional Safety Oversight:  Olcay noted that Turkey already 
cooperates with EuroControl.  He asked for additional clarification 
on how the U.S. envisions ICAO's role and jurisdiction over these 
regional oversight organizations. 
 
¶7. (SBU) GPS-SPS/WAAS Availability:  Turkey has no comment on this 
proposal at this time. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Universal Security Audit Program (USAP):  Turkey supports 
all efforts to improve security and underwent an audit two years 
ago.  However, what information will be shared, with whom, and how, 
must be clarified before Turkey can support such a proposal. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Unmanned Aircraft Systems:  Turkey firmly believes that 
ICAO has no involvement on issues dealing with military UASs.  Olcay 
added that the meaning of UAS must be more clearly defined before 
Turkey can support this position. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Halon Replacement:  According to Olcay, prior to receiving 
this information, he had never heard of the halon replacement issue. 
 Turkey has not yet formulated a position, but he suggested that 
further clarification would be useful as to who would bear the cost 
of this replacement and whether or not the units currently used 
would be phased out or required on new and/or existing aircraft. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Environmental issues (ref B):  Turkey agrees with the 
ideas presented in ref B in principle but has not yet formulated a 
position.  In general it supports all programs intending to benefit 
the environment.  However, some of the concepts presented, such as 
emissions trading, are new to Turkish officials and will require 
further discussion. 
 
¶12. (SBU) Action request:  Post would appreciate FAA and 
Department's assistance in providing timely feedback and 
clarification, as available, on the following items: 
     a) Provide copy of USOAP Working Paper; 
     b) Provide additional information about the U.S. position on 
CAST; 
     c) Provide additional clarification on the regional safety 
oversight proposal; 
     d) Provide additional clarification on the USAP proposal; 
     e) Provide additional clarification on the UAS proposal; 
     f) Provide additional clarification on the halon replacement 
proposal. 
 
¶13.  We agreed to meet with Olcay again closer to the date of the 
General Assembly when Turkish positions on the issues will be 
clearer.  In the interim, we stand ready to pass on additional 
information as it becomes available.
