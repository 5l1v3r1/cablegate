REF: SECSTATE 8861 
 
¶1. We met with Aselsan (Full name Aselsan Electronics 
Industries Inc.) Purchasing Manager Ahmet Arpaozu on March 4 
regarding reftel case (license number 050064457).  Arpaozu 
relayed our questions to the production and project managers, 
with whom we also met on site.  They confirmed Aselsan's 
order of 368 NVIS LED components at a cost of approximately 
60 USD per unit. 
 
¶2. Arpaozu provided documentation showing Aselsan received 
the 368 NSIV LED Assembly (P/N 0728-48A) on October 4, 2007. 
Aselsan confirmed that it has purchased the LEDs for use in 
the F-4 aircraft, as a component on the MXF-484 VHF/UHF 
remote mount radio.  Aselsan representatives informed us this 
is an ongoing contract, which is why different units are in 
various stages of production, storage, or shipment.  Some are 
being stored at Aselsan warehouse facilities, some are being 
integrated in the remote mount radios at the Aselsan plant, 
while others have already been shipped to the end user, the 
Turkish Armed Forces, as a part of completed remote mount 
radio units.  During our visit to Aselsan's headquarters and 
assembly plant, we saw a worker place one of the LED units 
into a partially-built remote mount radio.  We were also 
informed a number of units were already in Eskisehir with the 
Turkish Armed Forces and that Aselsan is not responsible for 
installing them into the F-4 aircraft. 
 
¶3. Col. Aydogdu from the Turkish Air Force confirmed the use 
of the NSIV LED Assembly as a component on the MXF-484 
VHF/UHF remote mount radio to be installed on the F-4 
aircraft.  He assured us the LED component was only to be 
used on Turkish planes and was not for re-export.  He 
confirmed the installation of the LED on the radio was the 
responsibility of Aselsan, while the installation of the 
radio onto the F-4 was done by the Turkish Air Force.  Col. 
Aydogdu also said that so far, the Turkish Air Force has 
received 76 units from Aselsan. 
 
¶4. Members of the Aselsan staff with whom we met were 
forthcoming and cooperative in response to our inquiries. 
Based on our meeting with Aselsan representatives, who fully 
answered all of our questions, we believe that the items are 
being used for the purposes stated in the license.
