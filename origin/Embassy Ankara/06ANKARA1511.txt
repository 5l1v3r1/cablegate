  In Today's Papers 
 
  CODEL Warner, General Pace Due in Ankara 
  Star, Zaman, TVs:  On Thursday General Peter Pace, 
  Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, will arrive in 
  Ankara for talks at the Turkish General Staff (TGS) and 
  the Prime Ministry.  He will also participate in an 
  international conference on global terrorism during his 
  two-day visit.  Star reports that General Pace will move 
  on to Istanbul together with the Chief of the Turkish 
  General Staff, General Hilmi Ozkok, on March 25. 
  Meanwhile, several TV channels reported that a US 
  Congressional delegation led by Senator John Warner, 
  Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will 
  visit Ankara on Thursday to discuss regional issues, 
  including Iraq and Iran, with Turkish military and 
  political leaders. 
 
  AJC's Jacobs Visits Ankara 
  Milliyet, Radikal, Yeni Safak:  American Jewish Committee 
  (AJC) Strategic Research Director Barry Jacobs met with 
  ruling AKP lawmakers Egemen Bagis and Saban Disli, and 
  senior officials at the Turkish Foreign Ministry (MFA) on 
  Monday in Ankara.  Jacobs told the press that not only 
  American Jews, but all groups across the political 
  spectrum in the United States had increasing concerns 
  over 'what Turkey has been trying to do.'  'Popular 
  interest in anti-American and anti-Semitic works such as 
  Metal Storm, Valley of the Wolves, and Mein Kampf makes 
  us wonder what is happening in Turkey.  Turkish leaders 
  should speak out against such movies and books in the way 
  we have reacted against anti-Turkish movies and series in 
  the United States,' Jacobs said.  Asked about the recent 
  visit by Hamas leaders to Turkey, Jacobs said that Halid 
  Mashal was no different than jailed PKK leader Abdullah 
  Ocalan.  'Both Mashal and Ocalan were supported by 
  Damascus.  The Turks understood that the timing of the 
  visit was inappropriate, but they gave very important 
  messages to Mashal,' Jacobs noted.  Jacobs said that the 
  Jewish lobby in the US would continue to back Turkey in 
  the event of efforts by pro-Armenian groups to pass a 
  'genocide' resolution in the Congress. 
 
  "Cobra-II" Describes US-Turkey Negotiations Before Iraq 
  War 
  Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Vatan, Cumhuriyet, Radikal, 
  Zaman, Yeni Safak and others: 
  A book by Michael Gordon and retired Marine General 
  Bernard Trainor, "Cobra-II: The Inside Story of the 
  Invasion and Occupation of Iraq," claims that if the 
  Turkish Parliament had not rejected the deployment of US 
  troops into Iraq through Turkish territory in March 2003, 
  Turkey would have been allowed to station 20,000 troops 
  in northern Iraq to prevent PKK infiltration and the flow 
  of refugees into Turkey.  The Turks may also have been 
  deployed to the oil-rich province of Kirkuk.  The book 
  claims that Turkey asked the US for 25 billion USD in 
  assistance as an incentive to join the US-led coalition 
  in Iraq. 
 
  Turkish columnists continue to express their view on the 
  situation in Iraq on the anniversary of the US-led war. 
  Kamuran Ozbir wrote in the nationalist Ortadogu that it 
  will be difficult for Iraq's neighbors other than Turkey 
  to help establish political stability in the war-torn 
  country: "While the Shiites would like Iran to help, the 
  Sunnis reject this.  Jordan's offer for assistance was 
  rejected by the Shiites.  Regional and international 
  developments do not allow Syria to help.  Therefore, 
 
ANKARA 00001511  002 OF 003 
 
 
  Turkey is the only country that can help Iraq to 
  establish political stability.  But first Turkey needs to 
  find a way to bridge the differences between Iraqi 
  Shiites and Sunnis." 
 
  In the mainstream Milliyet, Hasan Cemal notes that Turkey 
  would have received 25 billion USD in US assistance if 
  the parliament had not rejected the US proposal to open a 
  northern front into Iraq.  Cemal believes the 'bad' 
  situation in Iraq today would not have been better if 
  Saddam Hussein had stayed in power.  Cemal wrote: "I 
  traveled to Baghdad a month after Saddam was toppled, and 
  the Shiites and Kurds were extremely happy about it.  Of 
  course the situation was very hard to accept for the 
  Sunnis, who had ruled the country for 80 years.  As the 
  bloodshed in Iraq continues, we can see that the ethnic 
  and sectarian hostility among the Shiites, Sunnis and 
  Kurds as well as the mistakes of the Bush Administration 
  have played the biggest part in this." 
 
  Ambiguity Over Central Bank Governor Appointment 
  All Papers:  President' Sezer's Office announced that the 
  President has not received a decree from the government 
  proposing the appointment of Erdem Basci as the new 
  governor of the Central Bank (CB).  Prime Minister 
  Erdogan said the government had submitted to Sezer a 
  decree with a nomination of a new CB governor, but did 
  not reveal the name of the nominee.  The PM urged 
  everyone to wait for the President to announce the name. 
  Papers speculate that Adnan Buyukdeniz, former director 
  of the Islamic financial institution al-Baraka Turk, had 
  the best chance to be given the post.  Papers also report 
  that capital markets are in turmoil over the uncertainty 
  over the Central Bank leadership.  Meanwhile Omer 
  Sabanci, Chairman Turkey's influential business group 
  TUSIAD, criticized the AKP government for its handling of 
  the nomination, adding that the government would have 
  been better off extending the mandate of former CB 
  Governor Sureyya Serdengecti.
