¶1. (SBU)  In response to the March 12 violence in 
Kamisli, Syria and neighboring area, Turkish officials 
temporarily closed the nearby Nusaybin border gate to 
both entry and exit, fearing the violence would spread 
to the Turkish side.  On March 16, consulate personnel 
spoke with the Nusaybin subgovernor who reported that 
the situation remains calm in Nusaybin.  Other local 
officials confirmed that the border gates are reopened 
on the Turkish side.  At same time, many of the 
Nusaybin residents remain concerned for the safety of 
their relatives in Kamisli. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU)  As Newroz, celebrated by Kurds (and Iranians) 
on March 21, approaches, the potential for viiolent 
incidents in southeast Turkey also increases.  The 
Kurdish oriented political party DEHAP applied for 
permission for celebrations in Diyarbakir, Batman, 
Sanliurfa, Adana and Mersin.  These are expected to be 
large gatherings.  For example, around 400,000 people 
participated in Diyarbakir last year.  In addition, 
consulate has reports that the PKK successor terrorist 
organization Kongra-Gel issued statements that it would 
not accept mistreatment of Syrian Kurds and that some 
kind of (as yet unspecified) action might be taken. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU)  There are no reports of violence in Turkey 
related to the Kamisli clashes, but there are many 
opportunities for large groups with opposing views to 
meet under emotional circumstances.  The campaigns for 
the local elections are in full swing with supporters 
meeting in large boisterous groups and posting campaign 
slogans everywhere.  Until now, the atmosphere has been 
peaceful.
