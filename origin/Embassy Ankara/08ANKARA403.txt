SUBJECT: TURKEY: TGS ANNOUNCES WITHDRAWAL OF GROUND TROOPS 
FROM NORTHERN IRAQ 
 
 
The Turkish General Staff (TGS) announced the withdrawal of 
its ground troops from northern Iraq, which began February 
29, in a statement released on February 29.  The statement 
stressed that the 
troops are being withdrawn because their mission has been 
completed, not because of external pressure.  Informal 
Embassy translation of the TGS statement follows. 
 
Begin Text: 
 
Turkish Armed Forces launched an air-supported land operation 
(with the participation of Land Forces Command and Jandarma 
General Command) against the PKK/KONGRA-Gel terrorist 
organization into northern Iraq at 1900 on February 21, 2008 
- the most convenient time by taking issues such as weather 
conditions and daylight into consideration. 
 
Carrying out the operation in a season with adverse weather 
conditions was especially preferable for suppressing the 
terrorists' capabilities and in order to benefit from the 
capability of the Turkish Armed Forces which can carry out 
its duty under any condition.  Furthermore, due to the 
conditions, terrorists have not been able to use explosives 
due to the deep snow, and consequently they could not cause 
any casualties. 
 
The operation aimed at neutralization of terrorists in the 
region and destruction of the organization's physical 
infrastructure.  The Zap region was targeted as the main base 
of the organization from a geographical point of view. 
 
The operation was commanded by the 2nd Army Command in Sirnak 
and was implemented by the Jandarma Public Peace Corps 
Command in Cukurca. 
 
Air support to the operation was provided by the 2nd Air 
Force Command, while the army aviation and artillery support 
were provided by Land Forces based close to the border. 
Terrorist positions located in the deep parts and their 
shelters were struck by air forces and air support land 
vehicles. 
 
Our units have successfully carried out the operation across 
the border in the mountainous areas with deep snow and harsh 
cold weather conditions. The units consisted of commando 
trained infantry and flying units, while tank, armored, and 
wheeled vehicles were used in the operation. 
 
The weather varied from 0-5 in the daytime and between 0 to 
-15 at night. The snow was 0-45cm in valleys and 1-1.5 meters 
in high areas. There were intense fog and snowstorms in the 
region on February 25 and 26. 
 
Only the PKK terrorist organization was targeted, the 
civilian population and local elements have not been affected 
in the cross-border operation. 
 
The excellent coordination between Land Forces, Jandarma, and 
Air Force elements made the implementation of a cross-border 
operation to be considered as a paragon of joint operations. 
 
Air strikes were carried out against 60 target groups (272 
targets) during the operation, while 517 different targets 
were hit by the Land Forces fire support vehicles.  126 
caves, 290 shelters, 12 command centers, 11 communication 
facilities, six training facilities, 23 logistics facilities, 
18 transportation facilities, 40 light weapon positions and 
59 anti-aircraft positions were partially or entirely 
destroyed since the beginning of the operation. 
 
Along with the three captured terrorists yesterday, a total 
of 240 terrorists were neutralized during the cross-border 
operations. 
 
27 security personnel (24 military personnel and three 
 
ANKARA 00000403  002 OF 002 
 
 
village guards) were martyred in the operations. 
The majority of about 300 terrorists, who were identified in 
the region before the operation, were neutralized while the 
rest could not be contacted after they left the region. 
Moreover, shelter facilities, communication equipment, 
anti-aircraft positions, and life materials were considerably 
destroyed in the region. Therefore, the initial goal of the 
operation is assessed to have been 
achieved.  After the field searching activities carried out 
by our units, our units started returning to the bases in our 
country as of the morning of February 29, 2008. 
 
It is obvious that a terrorist organization cannot be 
eliminated with an operation carried in the region.  However, 
it is shown that northern Iraq is not a safe haven for 
terrorists anymore. 
 
It is evaluated that the carried out operation will prevent 
the usage of the region as a permanent and safe base by the 
terrorists and will contribute to the stability and internal 
peace of Iraq in the long term. 
 
The timing of the operation (when to start and when to 
complete it) is determined by us solely in line with the 
military needs and necessities. Turkish Armed Forces has not 
been affected by any internal or external forces in making 
this decision. Moreover, when these types of reports were 
released, some of our units which had participated in the 
operation had already been withdrawn to our borders in line 
with the plans. 
 
We will continue tracking the activities of the terrorist 
organization i northern Iraq.  We will not allow any threat 
coming against us from that region. The fight against 
terrorism will continue with determination both inside and 
outside the country. 
 
Those who have joined the organization - regardless of their 
reason - are expected to seek the kindness and justice of the 
state as they find out they will not be able to achieve 
anything by shedding blood. 
 
The public will be separately informed after the evaluation 
of the detailed reports from the region.
