¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish Armed Forces General 
Staff (TGS) website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK. 
Press services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) In April 2007, 17 security personnel died in clashes with the 
PKK or in IED explosions.  In addition, a village guard drowned as 
he was crossing a river during an operation in Sirnak province. 
During the same period 16 security officials were wounded in action 
(WIA).  One villager was injured by a PKK-planted IED in Sirnak 
province. 
 
¶3. (U) One PKK terrorist died when the explosive he was preparing 
went off in Mersin.  The body of another PKK terrorist was found in 
the field as operations were going on in Bitlis.  47 PKK terrorists 
were arrested. 
 
¶4. (U) The Turkish military reported 27 clashes between security 
forces and PKK terrorists in the region.  Security forces unearthed 
dozens of PKK shelters and caves and seized booby-trapped land 
mines; other explosives, including A-4 and TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; 
cartridges; hand grenades; pistols; night vision binoculars; TV 
sets; satellite antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. (U) Activity as reported by TGS appears to be significantly 
higher for April than the previous month:
