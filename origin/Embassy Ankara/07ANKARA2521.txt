(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) During the October 1-7, 2007 reporting period, 15 GOT 
security officials were killed.  Ten security officials were 
injured, including three in explosions. 
 
¶3. (U) In the same period, four PKK terrorists were killed, 
including one PKKer found dead in a field.  Four PKKers were 
captured. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported nine clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists in Turkey's southeastern region during the 
reporting period.  Security forces discovered at least 24 PKK 
shelters/caves/caches and seized booby-trapped land mines; other 
explosives, including A-4 and TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; 
hand grenades; pistols; night vision binoculars; TV sets; satellite 
antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. Throughout the week security forces spotted seven PKK explosives 
in the region, most of which were detonated in a controlled 
environment. 
 
¶6. (U) Activity as reported by TGS website:
