(U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche July 13 to Turkish MFA 
Deputy General Directorate for International Organizations 
(IO).  The IO Office privately expressed support for a 
U.S.-Turkey Article 98 agreement, but caveated near-term GOT 
movement in this direction by asserting the GOT would not 
risk damage to its already-fragile EU aspirations.  According 
to the IO office, the GOT will endeavor to maintain Turkey's 
status quo on ICC issues, namely exclusion from the Rome 
Statute and Article 98 agreements.  Until the U.S. and the EU 
move beyond ICC gridlock, our interlocutor indicated the GOT 
would be open to alternative bilateral non-surrender 
agreements through NATO or other military channels.
