In view of the UNSC Resolutions No:1483 (2003), 1511 (2003)

territorial integrity, stability and security of Iraq and its 
continued commitment of support for the reconstruction of 
that country, as well as for the efforts aiming at providing 
humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people, the Council of 
Ministers adopted, on 17 May 2007, the Decree No: 12189 
extending the validity of the Decree No:10568 until 22 June 
¶2008. 
 
The rules and principles to be applied to the US Forces for 
the logistics support activities carried out through Turkish 
sea ports and airports, including the 10th Tanker Base 
Command/Incirlik, remain unchanged.
