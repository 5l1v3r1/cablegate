SUBJECT: TURKEY ON PROPOSED GLOBAL MARITIME PARTNERSHIP 
 
REF: STATE 50488 
 
¶1.  We delivered reftel demarche to Turkish MFA Maritime 
Department Head Mehmet Poroy.  Poroy told us that Turkey 
agrees with the principles of the Global Maritime Partnership 
(GMP) in general; however, he had a number of questions about 
how the GMP will work operationally that were not answered in 
the demarche.  Poroy told us that Turkey is already 
cooperating on maritime safety and security exercises under 
the auspices of NATO, with neighboring countries in the Black 
Sea, and hopes to begin such cooperation with the EU in the 
Mediterranean.  As an International Maritime Organization 
Council member they also contribute regularly to that body's 
collaboration. 
 
¶2.  Poroy,s main concern about GMP is the lack of an 
administrative body or organizational structure under which 
partners can meet to decide where and when to cooperate.  He 
also stressed that cooperation would need to include a real 
exchange of information.  Poroy added that Turkey would be 
interested in learning more about the GMP as the concept 
develops.
