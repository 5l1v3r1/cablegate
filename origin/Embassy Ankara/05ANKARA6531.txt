Following issuance of the report prepared by the UN 
International Independent Investigation Commission, which was 
established with the purpose of investigating the 
assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, 
the UN Security Council adopted a resolution on October 31, 
¶2005.  The resolution urges Syria to conduct closer and more 
concrete cooperation with the Commission in the next phase of 
the investigation.  We desire that Syria take this call into 
consideration and increase its cooperation with the 
Commission. 
 
As is known, the mandate of the UN International Independent 
Investigation Commission was extended until December 15, 
¶2005.  Turkey attaches importance to the Commission -- to 
which it has contributed by sending an expert -- completing 
its investigation within this period.
