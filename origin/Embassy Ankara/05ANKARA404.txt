¶1.  (SBU) The new GOT MFA DDG for Energy and Water, Mithat 
Rende, gave EconCounselor MFA's reaction to a meeting in 
Washington between the new DOE A/S for International Affairs 
Karen Harbert and GOT Ambassador Logoglu.  According to the 
MFA's report, the meeting was also attended by DAS John 
Brodman and Desk Officer Chuck Washington.  Rende said DOE 
proposed restarting the "Bilateral Energy Dialogue" via a 
series of meetings and study missions at expert and policy 
levels, kicked off by a visit to Ankara by Chuck Washington 
in early February.  According to Rende, DOE told the GOT 
Ambassador that it had consulted already with the GOT 
Ministry of Energy.  Rende confirmed this and said that the 
MOE and MFA were in favor of DOE's proposals. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post's understanding had been that given State's 
and other agencies' significant interests in the range of 
energy issues, including, among others, energy security, BTC 
oil pipeline, East-West Energy Corridor, Bosphorus bypass, 
and natural gas, DOE agreed last year to put the U.S.-Turkey 
energy dialogue under the EPC.  We believe it is important 
that energy issues be pursued in the context of the overall 
economic and political relationship, including in the ongoing 
interagency discussions on recalibrating the relationship as 
Turkey pursues its membership in the EU.  We reiterate our 
expectation that USG initiatives with Turkey be put forward 
only based on full appropriate coordination, and that this 
Embassy be kept fully engaged in the formulation and 
presentation of any initiatives.    Post looks forward to 
instructions on how to proceed.
