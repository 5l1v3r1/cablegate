¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche and aide-memoire to 
Haldun Tekneci, Maritime Department Head at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  He recognized the ongoing and active 
participation of the United States in the IMO and observed 
that Turkey and the United States have a long history of 
excellent cooperation on maritime issues in general and at 
the IMO in particular.  While making no commitments, he said 
that he expected Turkey would be supportive of the U.S. 
candidacy. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Tekneci noted that the Turkish Embassy in Washington 
had already demarched IO/T requesting support for Turkey's 
own candidacy as a Category "C" member of the IMO Council and 
provided a copy of the aide-memoire on that topic (a copy 
should have also been delivered to Embassy London).  He 
understood that the U.S. does not enter into formal mutual 
support agreements, but expressed his hope that the U.S. 
would view Turkey's candidacy favorably.  He stated that 
Turkey has already obtained over forty commitments of support 
from other Member States, but that "we cannot rest on our 
laurels" and that U.S. support would be welcome.
