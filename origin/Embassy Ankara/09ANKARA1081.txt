(SBU) We delivered reftel points on July 28 to MFA African 
Department Attach Ismail Aydil.  He said while Turkey still 
has not determined what position it will take regarding the 
Libyan language in the mandate renewal text, the MFA will 
take our position into consideration and will convey our 
points to his superiors in the MFA and to Turkey's New York 
Mission.  He noted that Turkey will also give weight to the 
final African Union position when making its decision. Aydil 
added that with regards to Sudan in general, Ankara's 
position is to try to avoid condemning language and to focus 
more on positive developments and possibilities for the 
future.
