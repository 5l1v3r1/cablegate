government will approve these changes in wording allowing the 
EXBS program to move into full force. 
 
¶3.    Future Activities 
 
      ¶A. August 2-3 ) Department of Energy SLD team will

¶4.    Red Flag Issues 
 
      ¶A. Finally approval of the U.S.- Turkey EXBS agreement 
is needed in order for the EXBS program to begin to have a 
significant impact in Turkey.  Without this agreement, which 
has been under negotiation for over two years, we cannot 
provide certain training and equipment to Turkey.  We expect 
a reply from GOT by early August. 
 
      ¶B. The SLD and ICP Programs are ready to start as soon 
as the overarching EXBS agreement is signed and in effect.
