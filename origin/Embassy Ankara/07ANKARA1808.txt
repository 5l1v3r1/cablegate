In Today's Papers 
 
Election Rallies 
All papers:  Today's papers give extensive front page coverage to 
the ruling AKP's rally held in Istanbul yesterday.  Conservative 
Turkiye and Islamist-oriented Zaman and Yeni Safak report that over 
one million people attended, while tabloid Aksam referring to police 
records, reports that 350,000 people attended the rally. 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports that the AKP used 
municipality resources to bring supporters to the rally location, 
with mainstream Sabah reporting that AKP supporters were transported 
to the site by 1600 busses, 17 ferries, and many other small boats 
and a train.  AKP leader Prime Minister Erdogan criticized the main 
opposition party CHP leader Deniz Baykal sharply and said that the 
CHP distorts economic facts in its election ads.  Mainstream 
Milliyet claims that the AKP municipalities have been distributing 
food packages, clothing, coal, furniture, stationery, scholarship 
and money to over two million families. 
 
Meanwhile, the mainly Kurdish DTP organized a rally in Istanbul 
yesterday to introduce the independent candidates they support. 
Former DEP deputy Leyla Zana addressed the people and said that 
Istanbul is a place for "multi-voices" and freedom.  She delivered 
her remarks first in Turkish and then in Kurdish. 
 
Yeni Safak reports on a poll conducted by the KAF agency.  According 
to the survey, 49 percent of Turkish people consider having a strong 
economy a priority issue.  Thirty-nine percent think that having a 
democratic administration is a priority and twelve percent believe 
that having a strong military has prominence. 
 
Turkey Makes Energy Deal with Iran 
Weekend papers, Hurriyet, Today's Zaman and Yeni Safak:  Papers 
report on the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Turkey and 
Iran to bring natural gas from Iran to Europe through Turkey. 
Sunday's Yeni Safak noted that while Russia works on the Southern 
Stream gas project, by-passing Turkey in the shipment of Turkmen gas 
to European markets, Turkey has made a secret deal with Iran. 
Today's Yeni Safak reports that the project will end European 
dependency on Russian natural gas and will increase Turkey's 
importance on energy issues.  Turkey will become a key energy base 
with the Turkmenistan line to be developed, in addition to 
Baku-Ceyhan, Blue Stream and Kirkuk-Yumurtalik lines.  Sunday's 
Hurriyet and Radikal say that the agreement will help Turkey 
finalize the Nabucco project.  Tabloid Aksam says that the US is 
"disturbed by the deal" with Iran. Writing in the business daily 
Referans analyst Erdal Saglam says that the deal will "strengthen 
Turkey's accession negotiations with the EU." Also in Referans, 
analyst Faruk Demir writes that the US "cannot ignore the role of 
the deal in ensuring global energy security" and while the US is 
working on different scenarios for coping with the Iranian risk, 
"Iran is the only alternative to balance Russia on petroleum and 
natural gas issues." 
 
Ferai Tinc says in the mainstream Hurriyet:  "Even though the 
natural gas deal seems like an important step on energy, it is far 
too early to talk about breaking the Russian monopoly.  Most 
important of all, the signed deal between Turkey and Iran is only a 
Memorandum of Understanding.  In the history of the energy sector 
there are many unrealized documents like this.  Iran is in urgent 
need of energy infrastructure investments especially at this time of 
growing pressure due to the nuclear crisis.  Thus any 
infrastructural investment by Turkey in the Iranian energy sector is 
very important for Tehran.  But this effort, even though Ankara 
believes that the deal does not violate sanctions, may pose a 
conflict vis-`-vis the UN resolutions.  The details of this energy 
project will be worked out in the months to come -- after the 
Turkish elections.  Even if the technical details are worked out, 
the construction of a natural gas pipeline is another big question

mark.  It is better to not to draw any hasty conclusions.  As for 
the announcement of this deal as a 'finalized energy deal with 
Iran,' it only seems like election propaganda." 
 
Editorial Opinion on US Efforts Against the PKK 
Semih Idiz comments in the mainstream Milliyet: "The US is keeping a 
close watch on the possibility of a Turkish cross border operation. 
I think it would serve US interests if the US, instead of watching 
Turkish military activity at the Iraqi border, exerted its energy 
watching the PKK more closely and passed target-oriented information 
to the Turkish military.  By doing that, the US would show its good 
intentions in support of its ally against the common threat.   And 
also such an effort would be able to prevent an undesired cross 
border operation by the Turkish military.  It would equally help the 
US counter the accusations about direct or indirect help to the PKK. 
 Washington acts in a hard-to-understand manner on this issue which 
causes the production of anti-American scenarios.  In a country 
where anti-Americanism is at a peak, the best course would be 
concrete action rather than public relation efforts."
