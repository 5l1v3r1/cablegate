¶2.  Completed Actions for the Reporting Period 
 
¶A.  Site Assessment and Meetings During Recent Reporting 
Period 
 
1)  Sep 4 -   EXBS Advisor met with outgoing MFA Arms Control 
and Disarmament Head of Department Serhan Yigit, new Head of 
Section Bora Kerimoglu and others to discuss current projects 
in Turkey.  These included a proposed grant agreement for new 
Z-Backscatter Van, Turkish Customs training cooperation 
project and the Department of Energy/Second Line of Defense 
(SLD) engagement proposal. EXBS Advisor reviewed a proposed 
grant agreement which would provide Turkish Customs with a 
Z-Backscatter van.  Yigit explained that the agreement 
appears appropriate and workable with a few minor changes. 
These changes were agreed to and a new draft agreement will 
be forwarded to Turkish Customs for approval. Yigit explained 
that final approval would be with Turkish Customs since they 
will be the organization accepting the equipment.  EXBS 
Advisor sought feedback concerning the draft documents which 
outlined short term and long term goals which were being 
finalized between SLD, TNP and Turkish Customs.  Kerimoglu 
expressed MFA's support for these proposals and that MFA was 
awaiting input from the appropriate agencies before providing 
official feedback to the Embassy.  He then added that he was 
hopeful that the US and Turkey could continue to find ways to 
cooperate while we await the conclusion of the EXBS 
Agreement.  EXBS Advisor agreed and concluded the meeting by 
reviewing past and upcoming training between US and Turkish 
officials. 
 
2)  Sep 11- 12 -  EXBS Advisor conducted a pre-departure 
briefing with Turkish Customs, National Police, Jandarma and 
Coast Guard officials traveling to the United States to 
participate in the International Sea Port Interdiction 
Training in Charleston, SC. 
 
3)  Sep 20 - EXBS Advisor met with President of Turkish 
Atomic Energy Authority (TAEK), Okay Cakiroglu, to discuss 
various issues including various areas of cooperation between 
the US and Turkey.  Cakiroglu noted there is a long history 
of mutually beneficial cooperation between the U.S. and 
Turkey; the latest cooperation in analyzing the seized LEU 
has been beneficial to all.  Cakiroglu welcomed the 
information which was provided by the US following the 
additional tests conducted in February and stated that he 
hopes that areas for future cooperation will soon occur. 
Cakiroglu added that the biggest obstacle to cooperation is 
the lack of information being provided by the US concerning 
the status of the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy Agreement 
(PUNE).  EXBS Advisor acknowledged this was an obstacle, but 
one that we must overcome.  EXBS Advisor inquired on the 
status of the Commodity Identification Training (CIT) course 
curriculum and schedule for upcoming events.  Cakiroglu 
responded that his staff had conducted a pilot course in June 
and is utilizing the results of that course to improve the 
curriculum.  He is hopeful to have another course later this 
fall. 
 
4)  Sep 24 - EXBS Advisor met with Turkish Customs EU and 
External Relations Deputy Director General Ihsan Kocer to 
discuss areas of cooperation.  EXBS Advisor provided Kocer 
with an outline of the recommendation made following the 
visit of the CBP training expert in June.  Kocer welcomed 
this information and explained that he will need to 
completely review the plan to determine what steps would be 
appropriate for the development of the Turkish Customs 
Training Academy.  EXBS Advisor reminded Kocer of the 
proposal to bring to Turkey a team of 4 CBP instructors to 
 
ANKARA 00002474  002 OF 003 
 
 
observe current on-the-job training being conducted at 
various Customs locations and work with the current Turkish 
Customs Academy staff to standardize lesson plans and other 
information.  Kocer stated that this would be a good next 
step, but said he would first like to review the finding of 
the report.  EXBS Advisor provided Kocer with a copy of the 
draft grant agreement which would provide Turkish Customs 
with the Z-Backscatter van.  Kocer said he was aware of the 
Agreement and that it was currently being reviewed by 
appropriate offices.  He added that he expects comments to be 
completed soon and promised to forward them to EXBS Advisor. 
Finally, EXBS Advisor informed Kocer that he had received 
positive feedback from MFA concerning the DOE SLD visit and 
that all that was needed was a decision by Turkish Customs 
concerning the order of site locations for the replacement of 
the current monitors, adding that work could begin as soon as 
November for the site evaluations. 
 
5)  Sep 24 - EXBS Advisor met with Turkish Customs 
Enforcement Deputy Director General Mehmet Guzel and Ender 
Gurleyik to review projects and other issues concerning areas 
of cooperation.  Gurleyik, who was the senior member of the 
Turkish delegation which participated in the Radiation 
Detection Training in Richland WA., stated that all members 
were very impressed with the training and that he believed it 
will be very beneficial in improving Turkish Customs 
capabilities.  EXBS Advisor noted that the individuals who 
attended the training are now better able to assist in the 
upcoming replacement and upgrade of the portal monitors by 
DOE.  Finally, EXBS Advisor updated Guzel and Gurleyik on the 
status of the grant agreement for the ZBV van, stating that 
MFA had informed him that the Agreement was now being 
processed by Turkish Customs for final approval. Guzel and 
Gurleyik agreed that Turkish Customs has been waiting 
patiently for this piece of equipment and predicted that it 
will deliver significant results once it is placed in service.
