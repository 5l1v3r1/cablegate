In Today's Papers 
 
Early Election Debate 
All papers report that AKP officials said on the issue of a mass 
resignation from Parliament that the General Assembly had to approve 
any resignation from the Parliament, meaning that the idea that the 
opposition could force early elections with a parliamentary walk-out 
was unrealistic.  PM Erdogan claimed that only two parties would 
enter the Parliament in the next elections and that the main 
opposition party, the CHP, would lose votes.  When asked about the 
Presidential candidate, Erdogan said that they would hold polls and 
listen to the views of the public, their deputies, the party 
organization and the relevant institutions before reaching a 
decision on a candidate.  Hurriyet quoted CHP leader Deniz Baykal as 
saying that the idea of a mass resignation was not rational, and 
they would continue to work for an early election. 
 
EU Agrees to Open Single Chapter in Accession Talks 
All papers report that the Permanent Representatives of EU members 
agreed on Wednesday to send an invitation letter to Turkey to open 
talks on only one chapter, enterprise and industry policy. The 
decision falls short of Turkey's expectations that talks would open 
on four chapters. 
 
Erdogan Urges US to Set Iraq Withdrawal Timetable 
All papers:  Today's papers covered the remarks that PM Erdogan gave 
before his departure from New York.  Speaking to the press, Erdogan 
suggested that the US announce a timetable for withdrawing troops 
from Iraq.  He termed the situation in Iraq a civil war and stressed 
that the number of US troops in Iraq should be reduced gradually. 
Erdogan also opposed the holding of early elections in Palestine. 
He noted that if the Palestinian President decides by himself to go 
to elections then this would mean he was ignoring Hamas, which was 
carried to power by the Palestinian people. 
 
Cross-Border Operation: Bargaining with the US 
Radikal reports that Turkey's special envoy for countering PKK 
terrorism retired General Edip Baser said that at the meeting in 
Stuttgart on December 11 with his American counterpart retired 
General Joseph Ralston they spoke about the possibilities of a 
cross-border operation into Iraq and asked the US not to oppose it 
if Turkey were to decide such an action was necessary.  Baser said 
that the US officials showed understanding for the Turkish thesis 
that if the US pressures the Iraqi government and Kurdish groups, 
then the PKK camps in northern Iraq will be dispersed, arms will be 
laid down, and there will be no need for a military operation,. 
 
Commentary on Iraq 
Columnist Soli Ozel, writing in the mass appeal Sabah, warns the US 
against creating the impression of favoring Shiites in Iraq: "So far 
Iran benefited the most from US mistakes in the region and currently 
Iran is making efforts to expand its regional hegemony -- a 
disturbing factor for Iraq and the other neighbors of Iran.  In that 
respect, the steps by the US administration for correcting the Iraq 
fiasco are very important and are being watched by the regional 
countries.  As for the Bush administration, there are increasing 
signs of Washington being stubborn once again and not making a 
policy change.  Yet it will be very hard for President Bush to 
persuade the military to send additional troops to Iraq.  Eventually 
he will have to look for help and support from the countries in the 
region.  If and when that happens, Washington should be very careful 
to not take side with the Shiites.  If there is a perception of 
favoring Shiites and Iran, it will only trigger a war between Sunnis 
and Shiites." 
 
Writing in the mainstream Milliyet, Sami Kohen expresses 
disappointment after reading the Washington Post interview with 
President Bush:  "President Bush changed his rhetoric on Iraq in a 
short time.  Just a month ago, he was claiming victory while at 
 
ANKARA 00006716  002 OF 002 
 
 
present he talks about neither winning nor losing in Iraq.  On the 
other hand, President Bush still leans toward increasing the number 
of US forces in Iraq temporarily.  It seems the final decision on 
this issue will wait until the new Secretary of Defense comes back 
to Washington from Iraq.  President Bush and his generals may think 
of sending some more troops as a tactical move in order to avoid a 
'loser' image.  However political reality shows just the opposite. 
If the US administration sends more forces there instead of pulling 
out, the perception will be entirely against American interests 
because everybody will interpret it as a sign of a permanent 
American presence.  Following the Baker-Hamilton report, there is an 
overall expectation of change from Washington in both military and 
political strategy.  The recent interview by President Bush in the 
Washington Post is not giving any hope in this regard." 
 
US Senate Vetoes Ambassador Hoagland Assignment to Yerevan 
Cumhuriyet reports that the US Senate has returned to the President 
Richard Hoagland's nomination as Ambassador to Armenia, citing his 
refusal to recognize the so-called Armenian Genocide.  The Armenian 
lobby in the US fiercely opposed Hoagland's nomination after the 
diplomat refused to recognize the "genocide" in his statements. 
Under Senate rules, the Senate cannot reconsider nominees who were 
neither confirmed nor turned down until the President reintroduces 
them again at the next Congressional session. When the new Congress 
reconvenes after the New Year, the President can introduce a new 
nominee.  Alternately, while Congress is not in session he can name 
Hoagland to the post in a temporary recess appointment.
