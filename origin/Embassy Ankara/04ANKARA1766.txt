PolMilOff delivered reftel points to MFA Disarmament Head of 
Department Bulent Meric and Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade 
Head of Depart Ali Riza Oktay March 17.  On March 23 Meric 
responded to PolMilOff noting that upon initial consideration 
the GOT found the USG proposals reasonable and had no 
objections.  He added that the GOT had also received points 
from the French that it also considered reasonable.  Meric 
did not elaborate on the French proposals but indicated that 
the two proposals were not mutually exclusive.
