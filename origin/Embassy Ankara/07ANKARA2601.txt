SUBJECT: PROVOCATIVE PKK ATTACKS IN SE TURKEY 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: PKK terrorists have carried out attacks on Turkish 
security and other targets over the last 36 hours, accounting for 
the deaths of at least 12, and possibly more, security personnel. 
At least 16 security personnel were injured, along with another 17 
civilians in a separate attack.  Early press accounts of the attacks 
included allegations that upward of 10 additional security forces 
were missing and possibly abducted.  However, Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) sources have not confirmed this and reporting on that aspect 
of the attacks is no longer being seen in most media outlets. 
Government leaders have appealed for the public and the media to 
remain calm and to refrain from pointing fingers regarding whom is 
to blame for this and other multiple casualty attacks carried out by 
terrorists over the past three weeks.  President Gul chaired an 
emergency counter terrorism meeting beginning at 20:00 local time 
October 21 to discuss the attacks and the government's response 
(reported septel).  Meanwhile, TGS sources claim at least 32 
terrorist have been killed thus far in ongoing security operations 
at 63 separate points in the region along the Turkey-Iraq border. 
Ambassador condemned the attacks and expressed USG regret and 
support for Turkey to MFA officials, as well as in a public 
statement and a televised interview.  END SUMMARY 
 
TERROR ATTACKS: At Least 12 Killed, Another 33 Injured 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Turkish military and other sources, an 
unusually large force of PKK terrorists, numbering upwards of 200, 
carried out a coordinated attack on a Turkish military convoy 
carrying security forces who were pursuing terrorists who have been 
active in the area in recent weeks.  The attack occurred on a bridge 
near the town of Daglica in Hakkari Province, several kilometers 
north of the Iraqi border.  The terrorists attacked from three 
separate directions beginning about 00:20 local time on October 21, 
blowing up the bridge and opening fire on vehicles.  TGS announced 
that 12 soldiers were killed in the ambush, with another 16 injured, 
several critically.  These numbers are slightly lower than initial 
reporting that appeared in local press.  Reports of another eight to 
ten soldiers missing and possibly abducted remain unconfirmed, and 
most media outlets have scaled back their reporting on this aspect 
of the attack. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a separate attack, at least one minibus traveling in a 
civilian convoy reportedly hit an IED buried beneath the road 
surface in the same general area (near Daglica) at about 13:30 local 
time on October 21.  The convoy was traveling to a village to pick 
up a bride for a wedding ceremony.  17 civilians are reported as 
having been injured in that attack, including five children. 
 
Officials and Opposition Leaders Condemn Attack; Call For Action 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Reaction to the attacks from across the political spectrum 
has been strident.  However, GOT officials have appealed for public 
calm and have sought to reassure the Turkish people that the state 
will react in a way and at a time that is in the nation's best 
interest.  After casting his vote for the constitutional amendment 
referendum in Istanbul, PM Erdogan said that the nation's fury is 
high, but called for a display of national unity.  "We are 
determined to deal with this issue with common sense... (and) will 
hold a meeting under the chairmanship of our President to decide 
what steps we will take. As our parliament had authorized us, we 
will do whatever necessary within the legal framework of this 
authorization."  He urged the media to broadcast reports 
responsibly. 
 
¶5. (SBU) President Gul expressed sorrow and pain on behalf of the 
nation.  He said the Turkish people should be confident that the 
entire nation is together in the struggle against terrorism and that 
Turkey must display determination and wisdom in its next steps.  In 
addition to the counter terror meeting convened late in the evening 
October 21 (septel), Gul has invited leaders of the political 
parties represented in parliament for meetings to be held on the 
morning of October 22 in an effort to maintain unity across 
 
ANKARA 00002601  002 OF 003 
 
 
political party lines.  He underlined the importance of preserving 
brotherhood within the country.  Gul also said Turkey attaches a 
great deal of importance to the political integrity and territorial 
unity of Iraq...more so than some Iraqi groups. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Deputy PM and government spokesman Cemil Cicek asked the 
public to remain calm, noting that protest demonstrations had taken 
place across the nation.  He said the spontaneous demonstrations had 
been initiated with good intentions, but warned against the danger 
of "provocateurs" (NFI) getting involved.  He asked the public to 
have full confidence in the state and security forces and repeated 
that "the GOT, security forces and relevant offices were continuing 
the fight against terrorism with full determination."  Television 
outlets quoted Minister of Defense Vecdi Gonul as saying the 
government "will consider crossing the border...but not 
immediately." 
 
¶7. (SBU) In addition to demonstrations in various cities around the 
nation, Turks have reacted both with anger and sorrow.  All major 
television outlets have cancelled their normally scheduled live 
entertainment programs.  The Golden Orange Film Festival and Award 
Ceremony in Antalya was also canceled.  There have been no organized 
protests at mission facilities.  However, there have been several 
isolated incidents at the embassy in which individuals or small 
groups drove by yelling anti-American statements. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Opposition politicians also denounced the attacks and 
called for swift retaliation.  Republican People's Party Chairman 
Deniz Baykal denounced the attack and said a "national platform 
against terrorism" should be established immediately.  He called 
upon civilian and military leaders to come together and display a 
common resolve.  Nationalist Action Party leader Devlet Bahceli said 
that the government should immediately determine when and how to 
move forward with military action authorized by parliament earlier 
this week, adding that a cross border operation (CBO) should 
definitely be launched and the "shed blood should not remain without 
response."  He asked GOT leaders to take all necessary measures to 
deal with the threat to the nation, including the possibility of 
declaring a state of emergency.  Pro-Kurdish Democratic Society 
Party (DTP) parliamentary group chairman Ahmet Turk said that his 
party is sorry about the incident, as they always are about such 
incidents. 
 
Security Operation Continues 
----------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) According to TGS sources, counter terror operations 
continue in Hakkari Province, in the region near where the attacks 
occurred.  At last report, 32 PKK terrorists have been killed in the 
fighting, with press reports claiming that Turkish military 
helicopters have fired upon fleeing PKK forces.  Further west along 
the border, in the area of the Habur Gate border crossing and 
Silopi, the situation remains normal. 
 
Ambassador Condemns Attacks...Voices Support for GOT 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶10. (SBU) Ambassador spoke with MFA Acting Under Secretary Ali Acet 
in mid-afternoon on October 21 and expressed U.S. regrets for the 
attacks and USG support for the GOT.  He asked that MFA keep the 
embassy informed as matters developed.  He also urged that GOT 
officials keep in mind the trap the PKK is attempting to set in 
order to precipitate Turkish military action in Iraq and drive a 
wedge between the GOT and authorities in Baghdad.  Ambassador also 
spoke with Under Secretary Apakan late Sunday night to convey the 
same message.  Acet labeled the attacks as inexcusable and said 
Turkey is committed to taking steps to prevent a recurrence.  He 
added that no statements by the Iraqis, including by President 
Talabani or KRG President Barzani, can at this point ease the 
emotional outrage felt by Turks. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Ambassador released a public statement condemning the 
attacks and later reiterated the points in a televised interview on 
NTV.  The NTV correspondent, who has exceptionally good contacts 
with the government, military, and bureaucracy, said that he expects 
 
ANKARA 00002601  003 OF 003 
 
 
Turkish air strikes against PKK encampments adjacent to Hakkari. 
 
¶12. (SBU) COMMENT: The attack on the military convoy was unusual in 
its scope and the size of the force employed by the PKK.  PKK 
attacks in recent years have involved far fewer personnel.  This 
operation involving over 200 fighters is reminiscent of PKK attacks 
at the height of the anti-Turkish violence of the 1990s and 
demonstrates the desperate nature with which the PKK is pursuing its 
effort to provoke a CBO by Turkish forces and to prevent 
Turkish-Iraqi cooperation countering the terrorist group's 
operations in northern Iraq.
