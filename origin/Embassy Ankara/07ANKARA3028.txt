SUBJECT: TURKEY: REACTIONS TO CONTINUED AIRSTRIKES AGAINST 
PKK 
 
REF: ANKARA 3006 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Public reaction to repeated Turkish strikes 
against PKK targets in northern Iraq continues to be 
positive.  The role the U.S. has played in sharing 
intelligence and deconflicting Iraqi airspace has also 
received a great deal of positive attention.  Turkish media 
continue to note the support Turkey has received from the 
international community in its struggle with PKK terrorism. 
The Turkish General Staff (TGS) announced December 25 that 
airstrikes carried out December 16 and 22 resulted in immense 
destruction to PKK personnel and infrastructure in its camps 
and operation centers inside Iraq.  Turkish media are 
reporting steps the ruling Justice and Development Party 
(AKP) is considering to follow-up on military strikes, 
including an enhanced repentance law or other form of amnesty 
for PKK rank and file and social/cultural, economic, and 
political steps to reach out to the majority Kurdish 
population in southeastern Turkey.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (SBU) In the days subsequent to December 22 Turkish 
airstrikes against PKK targets in northern Iraq,  Turkish 
media have reported extensively on TGS claims of damage 
inflicted on PKK operations.  Overall reaction has been very 
positive, stressing the belief that Turkey has finally 
achieved an ability to strike back against terrorists who 
have long enjoyed safehaven across the border.  Media have 
also focused on the U.S. role in sharing intelligence and 
deconflicting airspace over Iraq, as well as what they 
perceive as relatively muted reaction from Europe and 
elsewhere, to claim that Turkey's struggle with terrorism is 
finally receiving the support of the international community. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a December 25 announcement posted on its official 
website, TGS stated that its recent airstrikes against PKK 
targets in northern Iraq have resulted in extensive 
destruction to the PKK.  The announcement claimed at least 
150-175 PKK personnel who were not inside caves or shelters 
at the time of the attacks were killed, and surmised a number 
more inside such shelters were killed.  Some media quoted 
unnamed sources claiming at least 350 PKK casualties.  In 
addition, TGS announced the destruction of three command 
centers, two communication centers, two training facilities, 
nine logistical bases, 182 shelters, ten anti-aircraft 
batteries with their crew, and 14 arms/ammunition depots. 
Pictures and video of the operations and their aftermath have 
also been released by TGS to Turkish media.  We have no 
independent confirmation of any of these claims. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Prime Minister Erdogan addressed the AKP 
parliamentary group on December 25, saying that Turkish 
forces are not targeting civilians during operations in Iraq 
and accusing those who claim otherwise of lying.  Turkish 
media speculate Erdogan's comments are aimed at Kurdish 
Regional Government (KRG) President Massoud Barzani, who has 
been quoted by Turkish media as claiming numerous civilian 
casualties.  Erdogan said the PKK neither represents nor 
speaks for Turkey's citizens of Kurdish origin.  It does not 
want Turkey's southeastern region to be developed so it can 
continue to try to claim ethnic Kurds there are suffering. 
Operations against the PKK are being carried out to make the 
border secure and bring peace and stability to the region. 
The world accepts that Turkey has the right to fight against 
terror and disinformation efforts by the PKK to the contrary 
will remain ineffective. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Deniz Baykal 
said military operations should continue until the PKK is 
eradicated from Iraq.  Nationalist Action Party (MHP) leader 
Devlet Bahceli supports continued operations and said his 
party would oppose any legislative efforts to enhance the 
existing repentance law (Turkish Penal Code Article 221) into 
 
ANKARA 00003028  002 OF 002 
 
 
a broader form of amnesty. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) officials 
were the most outspoken critics of ongoing military action 
and the U.S. role.  The DTP party assembly decided on 
December 25 that DTP members of parliament would participate 
in activities designed to form a human shield along the 
Turkey-Iraq border to force Turkey to cease military 
operations against the PKK.  While laying a black wreath of 
protest in front of the consulate in Istanbul, DTP Istanbul 
MP Halik Aksoy said that among Kurds, "informing" on someone 
is among the lowest actions one can take.  They see U.S. 
actions facilitating Turkish attacks against the PKK in this 
light. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Some media outlets reported on a follow-on package 
they claim is now under consideration by the GOT with the aim 
of attracting PKKers to give up their armed struggle.  Among 
the provisions: 
 
- Expand upon existing Article 221 (repentance law) to offer 
witness protection to those members of the PKK who provide 
useful information that can be used against PKK leadership, 
to include new identities, plastic surgery, employment, etc. 
(NB: a new witness protection law is on parliament's agenda 
this week); 
- Convene a group of "wisemen" (i.e., MPs from the region, 
imams, teachers, other community leaders) to contact 
privately families who have members in the PKK and urge them 
to convince their children to surrender; 
- Ministers will travel weekly to SE Turkey to hear the 
problems of citizens; and, 
- Implement new measures in education, health, sports, 
employment, transportation, and religious affairs to raise 
the standard of living in, and better integrate, SE Turkey 
with the rest of the nation.  This would include greater 
economic investment in the region, increasing the number of 
doctors and health professionals working in the region, 
increasing the number of teachers from 17,000 to 25,000 in 
the region and building over 500 new schools, increasing 
scholarships to students throughout the region, and 
increasing funding for agricultural, irrigation, and 
handicraft projects, including through expanded use of 
micro-credit programs.
