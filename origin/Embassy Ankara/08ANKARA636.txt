¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of weekly reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary source is the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) website, which documents contacts and clashes with the PKK, as 
well as casualties incurred. 
 
¶2. (U) During the March 24-31, 2008 reporting period, three Turkish 
security officials were killed and five were injured in clashes in 
Sirnak Province.  The total number of security force casualties for 
the year through March 31 was 23 killed and 23 injured. 
 
¶3. (U) During the same period, 26 PKK terrorists were killed and 
eight surrendered.  According to official TGS website figures, 
through the fourth week of March, the number of PKK militants killed 
this year was 286, the number of those captured was 70, and the 
number of those who surrendered was 38. 
 
¶4. (U) One more civilian who was injured during unauthorized Nevruz 
celebrations in Van, died on March 31.  Civilian casualties for the 
year through the end of the fourth week of March were ten killed, 
with another 49 wounded.  An indeterminate number (but probably well 
into the dozens) of civilians were also wounded during Nevruz 
celebrations March 21-23 around the country.
