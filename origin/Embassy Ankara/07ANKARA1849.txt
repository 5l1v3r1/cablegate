In Today's Papers 
 
Taliban Attacks Turkish Convoy in Kabul 
All papers and TV channels report that a convoy of three vehicles 
transporting a Turkish reconstruction team and special team members 
was attacked by the Taliban yesterday near Kabul.  A suicide bomber 
attempted to open the door of one of the vehicles in the convoy, 
when he was unable to do so, he blew himself up.  Following the 
attack, an armed clash took place between the attackers and the 
Turkish Special team, injuring one Afghan civilian and one Turkish 
special team member.  Papers highlight that this was the first ever 
attack launched on Turkish troops in Afghanistan. 
 
FM Gul Comments on US Weapons Used by PKK 
Sabah, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Cumhuriyet, Vatan, Radikal and others: 
Mainstream Milliyet reports that in an interview with CNN-Turk, FM 
Gul said that the Pentagon had started an investigation into the 
issue of the PKK acquiring US weapons that had been transferred to 
the Iraqi army.  Gul said that according to initial findings there 
is corruption, that it appears some US soldiers were involved and 
that the investigation is getting deeper.  Gul said the following: 
"The number of American weapons captured in the possession of PKK 
terrorists is 1260.  We have documented this and brought it to the 
US's attention.  These are, of course, not the weapons which the US 
willingly gave to the terrorist organization.  These are the weapons 
given by the US to the Iraqi army, and somehow went into the hands 
of PKK.  We never considered that our ally the US, who declared the 
PKK a terrorist organization, would do such a thing.  [Believing 
that] is an irrational thought.  Currently the Pentagon is 
investigating this issue.  Unfortunately there is some corruption 
and unfortunately some American soldiers are involved in it.  They 
[the US] are certain about the involvement [of the US soldiers]. 
The Pentagon has informed us that it has broadened its investigation 
and is pursuing the matter seriously." 
 
A New Poll Predicts that AKP will win the Elections as a Single 
Party Liberal Radikal gives extensive front page coverage to nine 
surveyS conducted by KONDA within the last six months and with 25,000 
people.  According to the KONDA poll the ruling AKP will come to 
power as a single party government, gaining 42.6 percent of the 
votes, CHP will win 17.3 percent, and MHP 12.5 percent. Eleven 
percent of those polled were undecided. 
 
Post-Election Symposiums in the US 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports that two US think tanks will hold 
meetings on July 23 to discuss the results of the Turkish elections. 
 Reportedly, the former US Ambassador to Turkey Morton Abromowitz 
will speak at the Center for Strategic and International Studies 
(CSIS) and that State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary Matt 
Bryza, US House of Representatives Foreign Relations Committee 
Advisor Alan Makovsky and Soner Cagaptay will speak at the 
Washington Institute. 
 
A New Campaign from Armenian Lobby in the US 
Hurriyet, Yeni Safak:  After receiving the backing of a majority of 
lawmakers in the House of Representatives, US Armenian groups are 
now launching a new campaign to force House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to 
bring the Armenian genocide resolution to the full house.  The 
Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) has called on 
Armenians-Americans throughout the country to contact their 
representatives next Monday to urge them "to press for a 
congressional vote."
