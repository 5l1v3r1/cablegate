In Today's Papers 
 
Buyukanit on Turkey's Unitary, Secular Structure 
All papers report that in a speech at the opening of the new 
academic year at the Military Academy, Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
chief General Yasar Buyukanit gave three messages: no power could 
divide Turkey, change its secular structure, or shake the Turkish 
nation's confidence in its military.  On the Kurdish question and 
terrorist actions, Buyukanit said it was concerning that some 
circles were calling the PKK terrorists "brothers," and stressed 
that Turkey had to resolve this problem "within the law."  He said 
"action, not words is what counts in the fight against terrorism," 
in remarks interpreted by the papers as "a message to the US." 
Buyukanit also said Iraq was moving toward a federal structure and 
that it "posed a risk" for Turkey.  On the draft new constitution 
prepared by the ruling AKP, Buyukanit said the military would 
express its view on the constitutional changes when the draft is 
published. 
 
Gul Calls for Compromise at Opening of New Legislative Year 
All papers report President Abdullah Gul and Speaker Koksal Toptan 
addressed the opening session of the Turkish Parliament in the new 
legislative year.  In his opening speech, President Gul said 
democracy requires respect for radical and marginal views.  He 
called for "consensus" and "compromise" on the new constitution, and 
lauded the government's work to that end.  Gul urged the parliament 
to approve more EU-sought reforms.  He also called for more 
investment in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast region, saying 
infrastructure projects there could help the fight against 
terrorism.  Speaker Toptan said that there would be no change in the 
first three articles of the constitution, which are related to 
secularism, territorial integrity and the rule of law.  Toptan 
pointed to the parliament as being the place to seek reconciliation. 
 
 
Meanwhile, papers report President Abdullah Gul will travel to 
Strasbourg today to address the Parliamentary Assembly of the 
Council of Europe (PACE).  Gul will be the first Turkish President 
to address PACE. 
 
Kurdish Administration Reacts to Turkey-Iraq Security Agreement 
Islamist oriented Yeni Safak reports that the deputy chairman of the 
Kurdish Parliament in Northern Iraq Kemal Kerkuki condemn the 
security agreement signed by Turkey and Iraq and said that they 
cannot accept any border violation in the Kurdish region in Northern 
Iraq, based on agreements signed with any country. 
 
Dink Murder Case Continues 
Sabah, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others:  Papers 
report that during his trial yesterday, Ogun Samast, the murderer of 
Hrant Dink, said that he used ecstasy pills and other drugs for 
courage before the murder.  Samast claimed in court that Yasin Hayal 
threatened to kill Samast's family if he did not kill Dink. 
 
Meanwhile, papers highlight that the prison vehicle that brought 
Ogun Samast to the court had an extreme nationalist sticker on it 
saying "love it or leave it."  The gendarmerie covered the sticker 
after the public noticed it. 
 
ECHR Rejects Judges Nominated by Turkey 
Sabah, Milliyet, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others report the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) has rejected 
all the three candidates nominated by Turkey to fill the post 
vacated by the Turkish Judge Riza Turmen in the European Court of 
Human Rights (ECHR), saying there were stark differences between 
their levels of expertise.  During a visit to Turkey in April, the 
head of the ECHR, Jean Paul Costa, had criticized the Turkish 
government for its unwillingness to extend the mandate of Turmen. 
There was speculation that the AKP government declined to back 
Turmen because of his support for headscarf restrictions in Turkey.

Editorial Commentary on Turkey-US, Turkey-Iran Relations 
Haluk Ulman observes in the business and political daily Dunya: 
"Press reports were filled with positive stories about PM Erdogan's 
visit to the US and the successful atmosphere of the meetings he 
attended or where he gave speeches.  This is very good as far as 
appearance is concerned.  However, if we have to speak about the 
bare truth, despite all the exchange of goodwill messages between 
the US and Turkey, all efforts are to no avail.  For the ruling AKP, 
this relationship does not go beyond a domestic public relations 
effort.  Let's face it: the views of Turkey and the US do not match 
any longer, nor do their interests.  We just do not have similar 
views about the future of Iraq, about the Armenian Genocide or about 
the fight against PKK.  Iran has just been added to the list areas 
where the views of Turkey differ from those of the US.  Even though 
we express concern about the Iranian nuclear program, it mainly 
stems from the fear of consequences after possible American 
operations against Iran.  Moreover we are engaging in energy 
cooperation with Iran.  As proven by PM Erdogan's trip to the US, 
there is still a bilateral dialog mechanism but it can only be 
called a dialog between the deaf.  And it will remain so unless or 
until Turkey agrees to act within the unilateral policy line of the 
US." 
 
Enis Berberoglu writes in the mainstream daily Hurriyet: "Despite 
obvious warnings from the US about not engaging in business with 
Iran, Turkey moves forward on energy deals as well as a 
transportation project.  When PM Erdogan met with Iranian leader 
Ahmedinejad, it was actually the Iranian side who expressed concern 
about whether Turkey wants to move forward on the natural gas deal 
project.  The Iranian leader wanted to make sure whether or not 
Turkey had some concerns about going ahead.  The Turkish side 
expressed commitment to go until the bitter end on this project.  A 
rapid rail system between Istanbul and Tehran was also brought up as 
an effort to further cooperation.  The Turkish Ministry of 
Transportation assumed responsibility for moving forward on 
construction and management processes.  The two sides also talked 
about cooperation on defense particularly on recent operations 
against PKK at the borders.  Iranians explained their operations 
against the PKK in the Kandil Mountain area in detail.  In sum, the 
Iranian leader Ahmedinejad has every reason to be happy about his 
relationship with Turkey."
