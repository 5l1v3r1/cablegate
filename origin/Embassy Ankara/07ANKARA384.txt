In Today's Papers 
 
AKP Government Re-Shapes Article 301 
Sabah, Hurriyet:  The draft amendment of Article 301 of Turkish 
Penal Code, the law that makes it a crime to "insult Turkishness," 
will be discussed at the cabinet next week and then it will be sent 
to the Parliament for approval.  The draft reportedly changes the 
term "Turkishness" to "Turkish Nation" and also introduces the 
condition that prosecutors should get permission from the Justice 
Ministry before filing a court case based on this article.  Also, 
the highest penalty to be given based on the article is pulled down 
to two years from three years.  Justice Minister Cemil Cicek, 
reportedly, is not favorable to these recommendations for 
amendments. 
 
DTP Head Makes Controversial Statement on Kirkuk 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others report 
Hilmrdisd tQned to work with Turkey and the US in fightagainst the PKK. 
In other words, the US is while supporting Kurdish leaders with a 
language in disbelief to General Buyukanit, at the same time 
implying that Turkey should start a dialogue with the Kurdish 
leaders in Northern Iraq.  This proves that there are very serious 
problems not only between Turkey and Iraqi Kurds, but between Turkey 
and the US as well.  Would it be possible to claim that General 
Buyukanit's meetings in Washington were very successful under these 
circumstances?"

Turkish Parliamentarian Efforts to Halt the Passage of Armenian 
Resolution 
Yeni Safak, Sabah:  A Turkish Parliamentary delegation attending 
NATO Parliamentary Assembly meetings in Brussels cautioned the US 
Congressional delegation about the negative impacts of issuance of 
the draft Armenian resolution by the US Congress, on bilateral 
relations.  Head of the Turkish delegation Vahit Erdem gave the 
message olution anddevelopments in Iraq.  On the 
request of the Parliamentarians, Foreign Minister Gul instruced his 
staff to draft the letter. 
 
Editorial Comment: Iran's Nuclear Program 
Fikret Ertan observes in the Islamist-intellectual Zaman:  "In their 
latest statements, Iranian President Ahmedinejad and other 
officials, vowed to pursue the uranium enrichment program despite 
the UN deadline.  As a matter of fact, Iran managed to advance in 
this program using 'time gaining' policies.  Last year Iran managed 
to enrich crude uranium by 3.5 percent and reached the desired stage 
in producing civilian nuclear oil.  Iran had to face international 
reaction several times in the past for its nuclear program. 
Ignoring the UN Security Council deadline was Iran's last step in 
the Iran-UN crisis.  The main issue here is, despite the UN, IAEA 
and others, Iran has almost reached the point where it wanted to 
reach."
