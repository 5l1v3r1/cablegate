¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Turkish public and private sector officials are 
eager to move forward on consideration of Iraqi gas for export to 
and via Turkey.  The GOT is ready to discuss scheduling the second 
meeting of the Iraq Gas Working Group, but expects to receive a 
draft from the USG on conclusions and next steps from the first 
meeting in Istanbul March 9.  The Turkey Oil and Gas Exposition 2007 
generated lots of enthusiasm for Turkey's aspirations as an energy 
hub and southern gas corridor to Europe.  End Summary.

Iraq Gas Meeting - Waiting for a Draft from the U.S. 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In a March 30 meeting, Foreign Ministry Deputy Director 
General Vural Altay said he was satisfied with the March 9 meeting 
in Istanbul of Iraqi, Turkish, and U.S. officials to discuss 
Turkey's potential role helping develop Iraq's natural gas reserves 
for domestic consumption and potential export.  He looked forward to 
scheduling a next meeting, hoping for larger Iraqi participation, 
and asked for the U.S. to provide the promised paper of conclusions 
and next steps.  Altay expressed optimism that the hydrocarbon law 
would be passed in the Iraqi parliament in May and thought this 
might open the way for further discussions.

Quiet Progress on Oil PSA's in Northern Iraq 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Speaking at the Turkey Oil and Gas Exposition (TUROGE) 
March 28 in Ankara, Genel Enerji General Manager Orhan Duran also 
expressed optimism about passage of the hydrocarbon law.  In a 
subsequent private meeting, the holder of the most advanced PSA in 
Northern Iraq was much more cautious, noting that in addition to the 
law itself, the Iraqi legislature would have to approve annexes and 
separate laws for revenue-sharing, restructuring the Iraqi National 
Oil Company, and establishing the Federal Oil and Gas Council. 
Duran noted that there were still lots of opportunities for 
disagreement and delay.  If the law is passed, he expects that there 
will be a bidding round that would draw interest from major oil 
companies.  Duran said that Shell, Statoil, OMV, and others were 
quietly holding talks with the KRG and were poised to move forward. 
While proceeding on development of two wells each with production 
potential of 25,000 bpd, Duran admitted that Genel's Taq Taq 
Operating Company (TTOPCO), in partnership with Canadian Addax, 
faces risk on both the hydrocarbon law and establishment of egress 
for export of oil. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Duran said that under the new law there would be a review 
of the KRG's existing contracts.  Given that key Iraqi officials had 
participated in the original PSA signed in 2002, former Oil Minister 
Thadban had approved the contract in 2004, and the PSA was revised 
in November 2006, Duran was confident that TTOPCO was well 
positioned.  Moreover, he said that the PSA authorized export via 
Turkey and there were advanced discussions for potential pipelines 
north.  Duran noted that Norwegian DNO was the second most advanced 
PSA operator, adding that their field was very close to the Turkish 
border.  He identified Petoil-Prime (Turkish and American, 
respectively) as third in project advancement, but suggested that 
they may be targeting "flipping" (selling) its project. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) On Iraqi gas, Duran noted significant interest from Turkey 
in the first gas agreement in 1995, involving ENI, Gaz de France, 
BOTAS, TPAO, and Tekfen, before Shell subsequently joined.  Duran 
lamented that subsequent progress on Blue Stream from Russia and the 
new pipeline from Iran caused Turkey to be over-subscribed for gas 
and interest in developing Iraqi gas languished in advance of the 
Iraq war.  He was excited about relaunching these projects, and he 
referred to the Iraq gas meeting in Istanbul in his remarks at the 
TUROGE. 
 
------------------------------- 
Southern Gas Corridor to Europe 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) At the MFA, DDG Vural Altay expressed hope that there 
would be follow-up from the meeting on the "southern gas corridor" 
at the IEA in Paris.  He said that there was discussion on setting 
up the next meeting in Ashkabat to focus attention on the renewed 
potential for Turkmenistan as a source.  Altay expected that Azeri 
Shah Deniz gas would soon come to Turkey and he anticipated first 
shipment of Azeri gas to Greece in July via the 
 
ANKARA 00000756  002 OF 002 
 
 
Turkey-Greece-Interconnector.  He emphasized that Turkey would 
continue to be a reliable corridor to Europe.  Altay was supportive 
of the USG TDA funded gas transit orientation visit for an 
inter-agency group of Turkish officials, including the regulator 
EMRA. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Bosphorus Bypasses - Who Will Be First? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Echoing published statements by Energy Minister Guler at 
TUROGE, Altay said that the GOT's preferred Samsun-Ceyhan Bosphorus 
bypass had garnered 70% throughput commitments, but was unable to 
offer details.  In his TUROGE speech, the Macedonian Investment 
Minister expressed comparable confidence for the AMBO bypass, but 
also would not reveal the identity of claimed throughput guarantors. 
 Altay said that the official ground-breaking for Samsun-Ceyhan was 
postponed from March to April in order to schedule participation of 
the Turkish and Italian Prime Ministers.  Recently bringing on 
former TPAO DG Osman Dinc as new project manager, Calik Enerji is 
the main sponsor and ENI is the official partner for the 
Samsun-Ceyhan "TAPCO" project company.  Shell and Indian Oil Company 
are still "seriously looking".  Echoing comments we have heard from 
other companies and observers, the Chevron rep told us that the 
presence of a project "sponsor or middle-man" is an impediment to 
Chevron's participation.
