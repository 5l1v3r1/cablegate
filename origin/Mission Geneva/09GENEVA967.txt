1.(SBU) Charge was just approached by the Israelis. The Senior 
Israeli trade person at their Mission pulled him aside at a meeting 
to advise us that they have told GC Chair Matus that they can go 
along with PA observer status at the Ministerial Conference. 
However, immediately after that conversation Charge received a call 
from the Israeli Ambassador saying that folks in the Foreign 
Ministry had gotten a bit nervous within the last few minutes and 
decided they need to run the decision by the Foreign Minister.  The 
Ambassador is advising his authorities to "do the right thing" and 
he hopes to have an answer this evening. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Matus advised the Israeli's of the nomenclature issue. 
They have not had an immediate allergic reaction but are checking to 
see if it raises any concerns.  They do want to make sure that Matus 
uses the same words in introducing this issue at the General Council 
that were used when this issue was raised in the General Council in 
connection with the last MC.  The Israeli Ambassador also mentioned 
to Charge that he may seek our help in asking Matus to say that this 
decision would be without prejudice to other issues.  Charge 
cautioned the Ambassador that such a statement might actually 
encourage others to bring up the other issue he has in mind. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The PA's request for observership has just been received 
and forwarded to USTR/DC.  It seeks observership for this meeting of 
the MC only.  The Israeli's are indifferent to whether the term "ad 
hoc" is used as it was not used the last time.  However, the PA is 
insisting that their name appear in the list of MC observers in the 
same place as "regular" observers.  That raises delicate issues for 
Israel since the two categories in that list are "observer 
governments" and "observer IGOs".  However, that list is issues 
after the MC so the Israeli's tell us they are not insisting that 
battle has to be fought by tomorrow.
