¶1. (SBU) Charge was approached by both the Israelis and General 
Council (GC) Chair Matus this morning.  The Israelis passed on 
informal word that they probably will have some flexibility on the 
issue of observership in the Ministerial Conference.  They also 
indicated their intent to be very low key at the GC Chair's 
consultation tomorrow.  Matus, for his part, confirmed his plans for 
the meeting as reported in ref (e) but expressed concern about 
Egypt.  An Arab source has told him that the Egyptian Ambassador's 
approach to this issue is being directed from Cairo, with a 
suggestion that his directions are coming from the highest level. 
Tomorrow's meeting is for WTO Members only so the PA's more moderate 
voice will not be there as counterpoint if the Egyptians choose to 
go on the offensive.  Matus seemed pretty firm in his intention not 
to place this issue on the agenda for the October GC.  However, he 
is keeping his options open in terms of whether he might mention the 
PA request at GC meeting under other business until he sees how 
tomorrow's meeting goes. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We understand that when the Israelis met with Matus they 
handed him a note that they asked him not to circulate.  (They did 
not share the noted with us either.) In the note they argue that the 
PA does not meet the criteria for WTO membership as a country or a 
customs territory.  It goes on to say that they view the PA's 
request for GC observership as a violation of the terms of their 
bilateral agreements in that it attempts to unilaterally change 
their status.
