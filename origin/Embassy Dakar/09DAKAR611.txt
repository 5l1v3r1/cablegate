 (SBU) On Monday 4, May Pol/Econoff and OSC Chief conducted a Blue 
Lantern check on license 994633 to verify that defense hardware 
exported to Senegal's Air Force was being used for the stated 
purpose.  Embassy Dakar can confirm that: 
 
- 2 AN/ARC-182 (V) Radios sets were mounted in two mi-17 
helicopters 
- 1  AN/ARC-182 (V) Radios set was stored in the base's warehouse

transmitter; 1 MT-4935/ARC mounting base; 1 C-12109/arc remote 
Control; 1 Sensor systems S65-8282-34 Antenna; and 1 set of new
