SUBJECT: SENEGAL'S BUDGET IS ADEQUATELY TRANSPARENT 
 
REF:  STATE 28885 
 
In response to request for clarification of host country's efforts 
to make its national budget publicly available, as per Section 
7088(c) of the 2009 SFOAA, post provides the following information 
keyed to reftel's specific questions: 
 
¶A.  Yes, Senegal's central government is expected to receive some 
forms of assistance that would qualify it for consideration under 
Section 70889(c); 
 
¶B.  Yes, Senegal's annual budget is, in broad terms, publically 
available.  The government's proposed budget is presented by the 
Minister of Finance to the National Assembly's Finance Committee for 
review.  Afterwards the budget is sent to the full National Assembly 
for public debate, including the questioning relevant Ministers, and 
for approval.  The approved budget is quickly made available to 
members of Parliament, ministries, and others.  Journalists, 
development partners, civil society groups, and others can obtain a 
copy of the budget through their government contacts.  After some 
months, the budget is posted on the Ministry of Finance's website; 
 
¶C.  Yes, projected income and expenditures are included in the draft 
budget.  However, there can be significant delays in providing 
revised and actual figures.  The National Assembly is required by 
law to approve a revised budget should the government not meet its 
spending or revenue targets.
