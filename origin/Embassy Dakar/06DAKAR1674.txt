SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  (SBU) The opposition, already fractured, has been put to 
the test in recent weeks.  On June 30, the terms of office 
for Senegalese deputies should have ended, but the National 
Assembly remains in session thanks to a 2005 act extending 
the terms by eight months (Ref A).  Despite debate within the 
parties and society at large, only a handful of MPs walked 
out.  Two high-profile opposition leaders are menaced with 
investigation and prosecution over charges stemming from 
years ago, charges that portray them as corrupt and 
ineffectual managers.  Ultimately, efforts to use these 
charges as political weapons could backfire.  END SUMMARY. 
 
TOYOTA LAND CRUISERS AND PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
¶2.  (SBU) Several opposition leaders called for MPs to 
protest the Wade-inspired law extending the National Assembly 
term to February 2007 (when elections are scheduled to take 
place) by abandoning their seats on June 30.  25 of the 29 
opposition MPs, though, decided to stay.  Deputies earn USD 
2,500 per year, and most do not have any other income.  Wade 
eased the choice for each member of the Assembly with a 
salary increase of 300 percent, a four-wheel drive vehicle, 
and a piece of land in Dakar on which to build a house.  One 
opposition leader labeled MPs remaining in the Assembly 
(including those from opposition parties) as "illegal" and 
"usurping power."  Another, though, more understanding, said 
it was natural: "Many of these people have never even driven 
a car before, and now they have brand new Land Cruisers.  Of 
course, they're not going to give them up." 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The dispute over leaving parliament was by one 
account extremely damaging to presidential candidate 
Moustapha Niasse and his Alliance des Force de Progres.  The 
debate had apparently simmered for months within the AFP as 
Niasse prepared to leave the Assembly while his followers 
leaned toward staying.  Within the opposition coalition, 
meanwhile, Niasse apparently clashed sharply with Ousmane 
Tanor Dieng, who remains in the Assembly with all of his 
Socialist MPs. 
 
OLD SKELETONS IN THE OPPOSITION CLOSET 
-------------------------------------- 
¶4.  (U) In an additional challenge, Wade has called for 
resuming investigation of cases of mismanagement involving 
both Niasse and Tanor.  Niasse, who before becoming Wade's 
Prime Minister from 2000-2001 was Minister of Foreign Affairs 
from 1991 to 1998, is accused of participating in selling 
diplomatic passports to businessmen and others from mainland 
China.  Tanor, who served as ex-President Diouf's Cabinet 
Director, was allegedly involved in secretly selling fishing 
licenses to Russian ship owners on behalf of the GOS to 
replenish Socialist political coffers. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶5.  (SBU) Allegations against Niasse and Tanor are pointed 
attempts to demonstrate that not all charges of corruption 
involve the ruling party, and to widen cleavages already 
magnified by calls for Deputies to step down from the 
National Assembly on June 30.  Such political gaming carries 
risks for Wade, though.  Tanor, if prosecuted, could be 
tempted to reveal information to which he had access when he 
supervised all presidential services, including the 
intelligence community.  Moreover, it may be shortshighted 
for Wade to pursue Tanor as a way to cast blame for Senegal's 
fishing and illegal migration problems on someone else (Ref C 
and D).  Fishermen and NGOs may remind the public that, 
whoever was to blame originally, no significant or concrete 
steps have been taken during Wade's presidency to help the 
fishing industry. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In addition, now that Senegal and mainland China 
have established diplomatic ties and China has increased 
offers of investment and aid, dredging up Niasse's case and 
accusations that Chinese fraudulently obtained passports to 
help them get to European countries, could serve as a first 
test of the strength of those ties.  END COMMENT.
