SUBJECT: NATIONAL ASSEMBLY APPROVES CONSTITUTIONAL 
AMENDMENT EXTENDING TERM UNTIL FEBRUARY 2007 
 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY: On December 16, Senegal,s National Assembly 
passed a provisional constitutional amendment, extending 
deputies, terms in office from June 2006 until February 
¶2007.  President Abdoulaye Wade, whose goal was to delay 
legislative elections in order to couple them with the 
presidential elections, proposed the change.  Most opposition 
parties boycotted the vote and organized a major political 
rally to denounce the law.  They fear this may be one of 
several strategic moves to alter the Constitution and ensure 
Wade,s reelection, as well as his party,s longevity in 
power. END SUMMARY. 
 
A MECHANICAL MAJORITY 
--------------------- 
¶2.  (SBU) The temporary amendment suspends the applicability 
of Article 60 of the Senegalese paves the legal pathway for 
President Wade to couple legislative and presidential 
elections in February/March 2007.  The coupling of the 
elections, which was first broached in a public speech by 
Wade in August, would reportedly free up funds that could be 
used to assist victims of devastating floods that hit many 
Senegalese communities earlier this year.  After the 
elections, the amendment becomes null and void.  A majority 
of 72 deputies (3/5ths of the Assembly) was required to pass 
the law, but the ruling Democratic Party of Senegal (PDS) and 
its coalition partners secured 82 votes.  Even PDS deputies 
who are in open rebellion against Wade voted in favor of the 
law for reasons of personal interest.  Within the last year, 
President Wade has offered substantial financial and in-kind 
benefits to deputies.  No doubt desire to retain these 
benefits played some role in the vote. 
 
AND AN UNCIVIL OPPOSITION 
------------------------- 
¶3.  (U) The day after the vote, two dozen opposition parties 
organized a rally to condemn the amendment and call for an 
end to Wade,s regime.  According to police sources, 25,000 
people gathered to make their voices heard.  For their part, 
opposition sources claimed that over 100,000 supporters 
turned out.  They made it clear that, from this juncture 
onward, they will be more confrontational with the PDS.  One 
opposition leader told Embassy staff that the only language 
Wade understands is &violence.8  Ironically, prior to the 
opposition gathering, the GOS intervened to stop PDS radicals 
from staging a counter-demonstration.  Ousmane Tanor Dieng, 
leader of the Socialist Party (PS), the main opposition 
party, broke from his characteristically moderate stance and 
told the press: &The Government will be responsible for 
electoral unrest that is likely to occur.  They have put the 
country in legal insecurity."  Dieng also indicated that they 
will formulate a request to the Constitutional Court to 
declare the new amendment unconstitutional.  However, it was 
Talla Sylla who really energized the opposition rally. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶4.  (SBU) Many Senegalese hoped that the &alternance,8 the 
peaceful change of regime in 2000, would mark the beginning 
of an era of institutional stability and strengthen the 
country,s democratic tradition.  However, recent tinkering 
with the Constitution, together with frequent government 
reshuffles, point to seeds of instability buried within the 
clientele system.  The extension of the national assembly,s 
mandate and the possible reinstatement of the Senate after 
its elimination in 2001 seem to be part of a set of reforms 
that will provide the PDS with the means to follow the 
example of the PS, which had managed to hold onto power for 
40 years before being unseated by Wade,s coalition.  END 
COMMENT.
