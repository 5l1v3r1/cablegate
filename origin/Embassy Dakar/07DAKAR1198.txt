Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Secretary of State for 
International Cooperation Roberto Ferreiro Cacheu on May 31. 
Cacheu agreed to investigate the requirement to submit the 
Annual Declaration and submit as soon as possible.  He noted 
the importance of our bilateral relationship and said that 
the United States' concerns are Guinea-Bissau's concerns.  He 
also asked when the United States would re-open its embassy 
in Bissau noting the great importance the GOGB places on the 
return of the permanent mission.
