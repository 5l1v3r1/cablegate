REF: A. DAKAR 1113

     ¶C. DAKAR 1054 
 
¶1.  On July 11, Senegal's Senior Minister of Foreign Affairs, Cheikh 
Tidiane Gadio, told the Ambassador that he will now lead Senegal's 
official delegation to the AGOA Forum.  Gadio would welcome a 
bilateral meeting with Secretary Rice.  We do not expect recently 
appointed Minister of Commerce Amadou Habibou Ndiaye or other 
Senegalese ministers to attend this year's Forum, but that could 
still change in the coming week.  The MOC's Director of External 
Trade, Cheikh Saadbou Seck, is already in Accra and can help 
coordinate meetings with GOS officials. 
 
¶2.  In addition to Seck, we still expect the other GOS official 
noted in Ref A to attend:  Ms. Maimouna Savane, Director General of 
the Senegalese Agency for Export Promotion (ASEPEX); Mr. Omar Samb, 
Director General of Agency for the Promotion and Development of 
Handicraft(APDA); and Mr. Moctar Diakhate, Director of Artisanry.
