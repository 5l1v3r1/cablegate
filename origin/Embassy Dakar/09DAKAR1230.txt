¶1. (SBU) In a discussion with the Chief of Staff of Senegal's Air 
Force, Colonel Pereira, poloff was told that Senegal was not/not 
planning to purchase C-130s from Nigeria.  Instead the Air Force is 
in the process of purchasing second-hand CASA 235s from Indonesia. 
 
 
¶2. (SB) However, according to Embassy Abuja, Nigeria is still 
interested in selling the aircraft and would like to pursue the 3rd 
party transfer request.  Although Colonel Pereira said that Senegal 
was no longer planning to purchase the planes, it seems as if such a 
purchase had been in the works but that it has now been turned off. 
Senegal already paid Nigeria some upfront money for the aircraft, 
and Nigeria is now working with Senegal to return this money. 
 
¶3. For further information requests concerning this sale the contact 
person is Major Afia Bella-Bella based in Abuja.
