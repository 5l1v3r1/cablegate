SUBJECT: SENEGAL: REQUEST FUNDS FOR LOCAL ELECTION OBSERVER MISSION 
 
¶1. This is an action request. 
 
¶2. Embassy Dakar requests funding to support Embassy coverage of 
local elections slated for March 22, 2009. 
 
¶3. Breakdown of funding request follows: 
 
Observers for Dakar region: $261x4 observers= $1,044 
Observers for regions outside of Dakar: $120x13(regions)x3(1 
direct-hire + 1 FSN + 1 driver) =$4,680 
Total: $5,724 
 
¶4. Justification:  Senegal is one of Africa's leading democracies 
and this local election will be the last major one before 
Presidential elections slated for 2012.  As of this writing, Senegal 
is entering a critical junction in its democratic development as an 
aging President is preparing to depart the political arena while 
paving the way for the next generation of leaders, some of whom will 
surely emerge from these elections.  In the meanwhile, the country's 
leading opposition parties, who boycotted legislative elections in 
July 2007 citing massive fraud in the 2007 Presidential elections, 
have reluctantly agreed to participate in the election even though 
they continue to vociferously argue for substantial revisions to the 
electoral rolls which they deem corrupted.  Thus, the foundation for 
pre and post election tensions does exist.  As election observers 
the Embassy will not only be able to provide Washington thorough and 
timely reporting but the very presence of international observers 
may help to ensure that voting is carried out smoothly and without 
trouble.  It will also serve as a signal to the Senegalese and our 
European and African partners that the U.S. is serious about 
democracy and stability in Senegal and the region. 
 
Thank you for your consideration
