SUBJECT: AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK TO FINANCE BRIDGE 
CONNECTING SENEGAL AND MAURITANIA 
 
 
¶1.  During a recent visit to Senegal, the President of the 
African Development Bank Group (AfDB) announced the Bank's 
plans to provide financial support for the construction of 
a bridge at Rosso, on the Senegal River, which will link 
Senegal and Mauritania.  The project of building a bridge 
over the Senegal River, at the border between Senegal and 
Mauritania, has been discussed for years but never seemed 
to advance for various reasons -- mostly political.  In 
fact, it featured prominently in former Mauritanian 
President Taya's official visit to Senegal in 2005.  It 
seems now that Senegal and Mauritania have overcome their 
political differences and are committed to move the 
project forward.  This is a significant step forward given 
that in 1989, what started with squabbling between 
Mauritanian and Senegalese herders over grazing at the 
border ignited into a conflict that has left deep scars 
among the populations. 
 
¶2.  The erection of the Rosso bridge falls within the 
parameters of promoting regional and sub-regional 
integration, largely spelled out in the New Partnership 
for Africa's Development (NEPAD), an initiative 
spearheaded by African leaders and designed to address the 
current challenges facing the African continent, such as 
escalating poverty and underdevelopment.  One of the 
pillars of NEPAD remains the strengthening of regional 
integration through infrastructure development.  The road 
between Dakar and Tangier, viewed by Senegal and Morocco 
as a way to accelerate intra-African trade and also trade 
with Europe, will become fully operational only when the 
current delays at the Rosso ferry become history, 
something that the Rosso bridge aims to accomplish. 
 
¶3.  Senegal is an active member of the Organization for 
the Development of the Senegal River Basin (OMVS), which 
was established to implement development programs built 
around the water resources shared by Mauritania, Senegal 
and Mali. 
 
¶4.  U.S. companies interested in this upcoming project 
should be on the look out and consult with AfDB and with 
OMVS.  The scope of work will range from consulting to 
construction and engineering.  The AfDB and OMVS may be 
contacted at the following addresses:
