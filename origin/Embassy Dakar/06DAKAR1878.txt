¶1.  (U) On August 3, Senegal's Lebanese community staged 
another peaceful protest, erecting a memorial of sorts in 
Dakar's main square, Place de l'Independence.  The 
memorial includes American and Israeli flags with reversed 
swastikas, as well as signs saying "Israeli and American 
assassins" below pictures of dead Lebanese, especially 
victims of the bombing in Qana. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On August 4, the Israeli Charge, acting on 
instructions from Jerusalem, proposed a joint demarche. 
We opted to make separate demarches to the Acting Foreign 
and Interior Ministers.  Both understood our revulsion, 
but as of noon local time (GMT) the flags with the 
swastikas were still in place.
