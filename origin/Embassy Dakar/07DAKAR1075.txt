¶1.  (SBU) Embassy Dakar appreciates reftel report on Movement of 
Democratic Forces of the Casamance (MFDC) members in The Gambia. 
According to Senegalese government, media, and MFDC sources, we 
believe Gambian authorities currently have approximately 28 MFDC 
leaders and other rebels in detention.  Nearly all of the detainees 
are from the MFDC's "Mahmouda" group or "Northern Front," including 
faction leader Magne Dieme; Kamougue Diatta; Abu Dia (detained in 
The Gambia on April 21, 2007; Abdoulaye Diedhiou (in prison in The 
Gambia since February 22, 2007); Alexandre Djiba; Sidaty Diedhiou 
(detained in The Gambia on April 21, 2007); Leyondo Brikama 
(detained in The Gambia on April 21, 2007); "Kassari" (detained in 
The Gambia on April 21, 2007); and 20 others. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The speculation in Senegal is that these men were detained 
because they oppose Salif Sadio's Atika faction, which is also known 
as the Movement for the Liberation of the Casamancais People 
(MPLC).
