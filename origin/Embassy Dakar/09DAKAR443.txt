SUBJECT: KOREAN FIRMS INTERESTED IN MCC CONTRACTS AS AN ENTRY TO 
AFRICA 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On March 27, Mr. Ki-Joung Cho, DCM at the Republic of 
Korea's Embassy in Dakar called on Econ Counselor to inquire about 
the status of Senegal's MCC Compact proposal and to ask if 
implementation contracts are open to non-U.S. firms.  Cho explained 
that his government had received inquiries from Korean firms who 
were interested in pursuing opportunities with MCC, particularly in 
Africa.  Cho added that there are "lots" of good Korean firms, 
particularly for road construction and other infrastructure projects 
who could be competitive in open tenders.  When asked if Korean 
firms were significantly present in Africa, Cho admitted they were 
not.  He explained that Africa seems very distant and "different" 
for Korean companies, who have instead focused on gaining a foothold 
in Middle East markets in recent years.  Cho said that through MCC 
contracts, Korean firms hoped to gain experience and exposure in 
Africa that would encourage them to pursue other opportunities on 
the continent. 
 
¶2.  (U) Econ Counselor noted that MCC compacts follow strict 
guidelines for openness and that there may well be opportunities for 
foreign firms to bid on project or supply contracts and suggested 
that Cho's colleagues in Washington might want to arrange a meeting 
with the MCC.  EconCouns also recommended that Cho meet with MCC 
country officials and host country accountable entities in 
neighboring countries who have compacts in place, such as Mali, 
Burkina Faso, and Cape Verde. 
 
¶3.  (U) The ROK embassy in Dakar covers many neighboring countries, 
but Senegal is the only WAEMU country with a significant Korea 
International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) presence, and this is 
fairly new.  KOICA is focusing on agriculture (including rice 
production projects) and education (building some high schools). 
There are currently forty KOICA volunteers in the country (doing 
small-scale technical assistance similar to Peace Corps and JICA), 
but Cho believes that number will increase to sixty later this year.
