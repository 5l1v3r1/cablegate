Success Stories 
 
a) DHRF-05-685-002  Amount expended: USD 18,558.60 
 
GROUP NAME: Law Faculty of Bissau 
Project Cost:  USD 18,558.60 
Project Location:  Bissau 
Target audience:  lawyers, judges, law students, human rights 
groups, local government officials, Members of the National Popular 
Assembly, police, and others in the legal profession or with an 
interest in law 
 
DESCRIPTION:  Guinea-Bissau's civil code had never been compiled in 
an accessible tome for use by jurists, lawyers, scholars and the 
public.  The code covers topics including family law, urban 
planning, and property law. 
 
Guinea-Bissau has only one law school, which is largely supported by 
NGOs and donors.  The law school produced a Portuguese-language 
annotated volume of approximately 500 pages containing 
Guinea-Bissau's entire civil code, which included civil law 
inherited from Portuguese law, Guinea-Bissau's Constitution, and 
Bissau-Guinean post-independence laws that replace or amend the 
previous civil code.  One thousand five hundred copies were printed 
and distributed to the Bissau-Guinean public, especially those in 
the legal profession. 
 
Expected results include facilitation of the operation of courts in 
promotion of the rule of law.  The books will serve as a training 
tool for Bissau-Guinean jurists and other professionals in support 
of the justice sector's role in defending democracy and human 
rights. 
 
b) DHRF-06-685-004  Amount:  USD 30,000 
 
GROUP NAME:  National Research Institute (Institucao Nacional de 
Estudus e Pesquisas - INEP) 
Project Cost:  USD 30,000 
Project Location:  Bissau 
Target audience:  Students, university faculty, and the 
Bissau-Guinean public, especially people with an interest in 
research and Internet access 
 
The Scientific Public Library of Guinea-Bissau actually consists of 
approximately 48,000 books and journals.  About 15,000 publications 
and all catalogs were destroyed in the civil war of 1998-99.  INEP 
is the premier research institute in the country, serving as a 
resource for researchers and students and also publishing academic 
journals related to the economic and democratic development of 
Guinea-Bissau. 
 
The DHRF program restored Internet access to INEP, providing 
students with a necessary tool for any academic work.  The program 
will also help to replace and update the collection of books, 
academic journals and periodicals from those that were destroyed 
during the war.  It was the first time that Internet access had been 
restored to any facility at Amilcar Cabral University, the only 
national public institution of higher learning in the country.
