OF INTEREST FOR THE PROJECT DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT OF THE 
BLAISE DIAGNE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 
 
DAKAR 00000612  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY: President Wade,s dream project to build a new 
airport in Diass, a rural community located 45 kilometers 
(km) from Dakar, Senegal,s capital, is coming true.  The 
Senegalese government, through Senegal,s Investment 
Promotion Agency (APIX), has set the stage first by creating 
&Aeroport International Blaise Diagne SA8 (AIBD SA), a 
public-private company in charge of financing, construction 
and development of the new Blaise Diagne airport.  APIX is 
calling for expressions of interest from companies or 
consortia in the airport development and management business. 
 The new Blaise Diagne Airport is expected to accommodate 3 
million passengers the first year of operation.  Its planned 
construction has become a de-facto cornerstone for both the 
government,s overall economic development strategy and its 
long-term strategy to position Dakar as a hub of economic and 
commercial activities in the sub-region.  END SUMMARY. 
 
APIX,S LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR BOT PROJECTS 
--------------------------------------- 
¶2.  The new international airport is a flagship of Senegal,s 
infrastructure projects.  After numerous false starts, it 
seems that things are on the right track.  Recent legislation 
passed in February 2004 approved the bill establishing the 
regulatory framework for Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) 
infrastructure projects.  The Parliament also established an 
Infrastructure Council, made up of 12 members, among which 
are 3 magistrates, 3 parliamentarians, members of the civil 
society and the private sector.  The Council will ensure 
transparency and open procurement for Government projects. 
Both laws are now in place to promote a transparent 
regulatory environment expected to pave the way for 
Private-Public-Partnerships. 
 
APIX Creates AIBD SA ... 
------------------------ 
¶3.  In February 2006, APIX created Aeroport International 
Blaise Diagne (AIBD SA), a public private company )- owned 
45 percnt by the Government and 55 percent by private 
entities -) charged with financing, construction and 
development of the new Blaise Diagne airport.  AIBD SA 
reflects the spirit of the Public-Private-Partnership. 
 
AND WORKS WITH MOROCCAN BMCE FOR STRUCTURED-FINANCE 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
¶4.  Lacking the money to build a new airport, the Senegalese 
Government with the assistance of a Moroccan investment bank 
)- BMCE )- devised a scheme to levy passenger charges of 30 
euros per ticket on international flights from/to Senegal, 
and euro 1 per ticket on national destinations.  This 
financing scheme was established in April 2005.  According to 
BMCE, during the first year of implementation, 22.5 million 
euros, based on 750,000 passengers, will be raised. 
Estimates of the cost of the project are in the neighborhood 
of 259 million euros, out of which 220 million will be 
debt-financed and the remaining 39 million will be financed 
by the private sector. 
 
A NEW AIRPORT TO MEET GROWING DEMAND 
------------------------------------ 
¶5.  Once completed, the new airport will replace Dakar,s 
Leopold Sedar Senghor (LSS) airport, which, in 2005, handled 
1,480,000 passengers and moved more than 25,000 metric tons 
of international freight.  Airport officials predict 
passenger traffic growth of 4 percent annually, which is more 
than the LSS airport can handle with only two runways and 15 
parking bays for commercial planes.  At current traffic 
rates, the existing airport will reach capacity in five 
years.  Senegal,s strategic location on the westernmost 
point in Africa makes it a natural hub for West Africa and a 
major stopover and refueling point for commercial and 
military aircraft continuing on to other African countries. 
Senegal is a major tourist destination, and government 
officials hope to increase the number of tourists in Senegal 
to 600,000 in 2006, up from 500,000 in 2004-2005. 
 
BLAISE DIAGNE AND THE MCA PROPOSAL 
---------------------------------- 
¶6.  The construction of the airport in Diass falls under 
 
DAKAR 00000612  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
urban plans to move development off Dakar,s Cap Vert 
peninsula into the mainland toward Thies, Dakar,s second 
largest city.  Diass ties in perfectly with Senegal,s 
Millenium Challenge Account (MCA) proposal to implement the 
Diamniadio industrial platform on 2,500 hectares not far from 
the new airport site.  The on-going construction of a new 
highway between Dakar and Thies will improve traffic flow 
between Dakar and Diass.
