REF: STATE 70478 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Ambassador delivered reftel demarche to Foreign 
Minister Jose Antonio Garcia Belaunde in the afternoon of May 
¶23.  Garcia Belaunde, who had just emerged from a cabinet 
meeting at the time, said he had not yet had the opportunity 
to review the GOP's position on the Lebanon Tribunal and 
promised to get back with the GOP's official response by COB 
May 24 (when he returned from a one-day trip to Colombia.) 
Separately, polcouns contacted Ana Rosa Valdivieso, Director 
General of the MFA's Multilateral Affairs Division, to 
emphasize U.S. Support for a Special Tribunal for Lebanon and 
to request clarification of the GOP's position.  Valdivieso 
said the GOP agreed with the substance ("fondo") of the 
demarche but not with the "form," stating that the issue 
should be resolved in channels other than the UNSC under 
Chapter 7.  She said the Multilateral Affairs Division would 
therefore recommend that the GOP abstain on the upcoming vote 
but acknowledged that other government offices might have a 
different recommendation and that the Foreign Minister's 
official response was far from decided. 
 
¶2. (SBU) PolCouns of the French Embassy told polcouns May 23 
that the French Ambassador had demarched Vice Foreign 
Minister Gonzalo Gutierrez on the Lebanon Special Tribunal 
that morning, and noted that the VFM had suggested that the 
UNSC should not be used to resolve an internal political 
matter in Lebanon.  DCM of the British Embassy said he had 
not yet received instructions on the Lebanon matter but 
expected them at any time.
