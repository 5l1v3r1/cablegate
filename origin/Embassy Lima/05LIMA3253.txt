REF: STATE 130530 
 
Poloff presented reftel demarche on the proposed UN 
Peacebuilding Commission to Miguel Barreto, Deputy Director 
of the Office of UN Affairs at the Peruvian Ministry of 
Foreign Relations.  Barreto said that Peru favored the idea 
of creating a Peacebuilding Commission and wanted to become 
involved in its creation.  At the same time, the GOP has not 
yet developed its position in any detail.  Barreto said that 
he would review our talking points/draft proposals and 
consult Peru's Embassy in Washington and UN Mission.  Post 
will report further Peruvian reactions to reftel demarche as 
they become available.
