Classified By: Political Counselor Alexander Margulies.  Reason:  1.4(b

¶1.  (C)  The Ambassador reiterated our request for Peru to 
support the candidacy of Paolo Carozza for commissioner on 
the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (Ref B) to 
Foreign Ministry Under Secretary for Political Affairs Oscar 
Maurtua on 5/27.  Maurtua said that Peru is being heavily 
lobbied by Bolivia to support the latter's candidate for this 
position, and that Foreign Minister Manuel Rodriguez will 
have to make the final decision.  He added that he would 
inform the Foreign Minister of the Ambassador's request.  The 
Ambassador said that he would call Rodriguez on this issue 
next week. 
 
¶2.  (C)  NOTE:  The Foreign Minister continues to recover 
from a serious illness (a lung infection accompanied by what 
appears to have been hepatitis) that had him hospitalized for 
nearly a month.  He currently is working out of his home, 
handling Ministry affairs for several hours each day. 
According to Maurtua, Rodriguez' managed five hours of work 
the previous day, which so exhausted him that he could not 
deal with business on the 27th.  END NOTE.
