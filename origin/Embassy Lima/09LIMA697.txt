¶1. (C) Summary: The Peruvian newspaper Correo recently 
published an article providing apparent evidence of 
long-rumored financial links between opposition leader 
Ollanta Humala's wife/advisor Nadine Heredia and Venezuelan 
companies presumably linked to the Venezuelan government. The 
weekly magazine Carretas also reported that generous bank 
deposits made to her from suspiciously low-income individual 
clients. Nadine publicly acknowledged that she did indeed 
work for a Venezuelan newspaper, but said the work was 
legitimate and apolitical.  Nadine and PNP leaders then 
publicly accused President Garcia of orchestrating the leak 
of Nadine's banking records in order to undermine Humala's 
2011 presidential prospects.  Our own research has revealed 
similar indirect links between Nadine and Venezuela via an 
NGO called Prodin, and via a Spanish think-tank called 
Fundacion CEPS.  Though not quite a smoking gun, the evidence 
provides further support for the widely-held belief that 
Chavez has funded Ollanta Humala.  It also suggests the 
government is not above misusing confidential personal 
information for political ends. This can be a two-edged 
sword.  End Summary. 
 
The Correo Allegations 
---------------------- 
¶2. (U) On May 6, the Peruvian newspaper Correo printed an 
article providing apparent evidence of the long-rumored 
financial links between opposition leader Ollanta Humala's 
wife/advisor Nadine Heredia and Venezuelan companies 
presumably linked to the Venezuelan government. 
Specifically, the article stated that Correo journalists had 
seen bank records showing that Nadine received $4,000 per 
month for work as a "Social Communicator" for a Venezuelan 
newspaper called The Daily Journal during an unspecified time 
frame.  The article said that an investigator called one of 
the paper's representatives, who confirmed Nadine's 
employment but would not confirm that she had ever published 
any articles. 
 
¶3. (U) In the original Correo article and a flurry of 
follow-up media coverage, journalists reported that Nadine's 
bank records show that she also received unexplained income 
from a Venezuelan company called Venezolana de Valores, and 
from a variety of other sources.  One source was the owner of 
the PNP-aligned newspaper La Primera, Martin Belaunde, who is 
widely believed to have purchased the paper with Venezuelan 
funds.  Two contacts who knew Belaunde in 2006 when he worked 
for the Humala campaign told Poloff he transformed overnight 
from a moneyless advisor to a wealthy newspaper director. 
Press reports also highlighted an unusually large salary paid 
to Nadine by a security firm in Arequipa that had previously 
donated large sums to Humala's campaign. Carretas magazine 
reported that Nadine's bank account grew by $213,062 since 
the presidential race, and it questioned how a retired women 
who collects a S/116 ($33) monthly pension could afford 
consulting fees to Nadine totaling $31,300. 
 
¶4. (U) The original Correo article asserted that the Daily 
Journal had been a respected English-language paper until it 
was purchased in March 2006 by a group of Hugo Chavez 
supporters including Julio Lopez, possibly with money from 
two Chavista military officials with whom Lopez had separate 
business dealings.  The Daily's purchase coincided with the 
final month of Peru's 2006 presidential campaign, and 
according to Correo, Lopez soon opened a temporary office in 
Lima that distributed a free newspaper before shutting down 
after the election.  A Correo columnist wrote in a follow-up 
article that this free newspaper cost about $100,000 to 
prepare, print and distribute, according to the printing 
company hired by The Daily.  (Note: In Caracas, The Daily 
continued publishing pro-Chavez articles in Caracas until 
late 2008 but is now defunct. End Note.) 
 
¶5.  (C) In an interview conducted from the Congressional 
building and published on May 8, Nadine responded to the 
charges, acknowledging that she had worked for two Venezuelan 
media organizations but arguing that the work was both 
apolitical and legitimate.  She said she did not work as a 
journalist writing articles but as a communications 
consultant providing various internal advisory reports.  She 
added that she worked for The Daily from January 2007 to late 
2008 and had nothing to do with the paper during the 
presidential campaign.  Besides, she said, "it is obvious 
that $4,000 will not finance a campaign."  A party insider 
told Poloff that Nadine's advisors decided she needed to 
admit the charges and to defend herself because all the 
information was potentially releasable and provable. 
 
 
Counter-Accusations: President Garcia Behind Leak 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶6. (C) Nadine and PNP leaders then publicly accused President 
Garcia of orchestrating the leak of Nadine's confidential 
banking records so as to undermine Humala's 2011 presidential 
prospects.  Several PNP leaders noted that, in a March speech 
before regional banking executives, Garcia bragged that the 
President had the power to prevent the election of a 
candidate he opposed.  Clearly insinuating that the leak was 
an element of the government's calculated anti-Humala 
campaign, PNP coordinator Carlos Tapia reminded media 
representatives that sitting next to President Garcia during 
the March banking conference was the head of the very bank 
from which Nadine's confidential financial information had 
been leaked.  (Note: One Humala lawyer argued to Poloff that 
a series of human rights cases against Humala were also 
politically motivated. End Note.)  In a somewhatdesperate 
call for fair play, Nadine argued that the finances of the 
NGO led by President Garcia's wife, Pilar Nores, ought to be 
opened to public scrutiny so that all Peruvians understood 
the sources of her money too. 
 
Other Venezuela Links 
--------------------- 
¶7. (C) Our own research has revealed similar indirect links 
between Nadine and Venezuela.  According to a congressional 
advisor from Humala's Peruvian National Party (PNP), Nadine 
directs Venezuelan funding for social projects and propaganda 
through an NGO called "Promotion of the Identity and National 
Development of Peru" (Prodin).  Prodin, whose website - until 
it was recently removed from the web - listed Nadine as a 
Social Communicator in the area of Technical Development 
Cooperation, has among its development objectives that of 
"strengthening the national identity" and "promoting 
development thinking from a Latin Americna perspective."  A 
Prodin bulletin from 2007 - also formerly available on-line - 
said that Nadine helped the NGO sign a contract with the 
Venezuelan Embassy "to develop programs linked to the 
strengthening of human identity and sustainable development 
like the Miracle Mission linked to health and trips for young 
students from the interior of the country.  Likewise, Nadine 
is promoting cooperation with the Cuban Government in the 
area of literacy, education, and others." 
 
¶8. (C) Prodin is directed by Enrique Justamaita, whom Nadine 
has described to Poloff as her "chief lieutenant" ("brazo 
derecho") within the PNP.  Justamaita, according to one of 
our contacts, is a political operator who joined the Humala 
campaign in 2006.  According to Venezuelan press, Justamaita 
in 2007 traveled on a propaganda visit to Venezuela where he 
described Chavez's education policies as "an excellent model 
to follow in Peru as well as in other Latin American 
countries."  (Note: Prodin also worked with the International 
Republican Institute in August 2008 to provide training to a 
group of PNP mayors as part of a National Endowmnent for 
Democracy project. End Note) 
 
¶9. (C) The congressional advisor also reported that Nadine 
has collaborated with a Spanish NGO called the Centro de 
Estudios Politicos y Sociales (Fundacion CEPS), which the 
advisor claimed the Venezuelan Government helped to form in 
¶2001.  The advisor added that CEPS's Vice President Ruben 
Martinez Dalmau -- a Spanish expert in constitutional law who 
reportedly helped write the new Ecuadorian and Bolivian 
constitutions -- worked closely with Nadine to formulate the 
PNP's party platform.  CEPS set up an office in Lima in early 
2008 (its other Latin American offices are in Venezuela, 
Ecuador, and Bolivia), according to the advisor, but has 
since become frustrated with Nadine's controlling style and 
sought distance from her. 
 
Comment: Government Bends Rules in Search for Cash-Laden 
Suitcase 
¶10. (C) Many Peruvians believe that Humala's long-rumored 
financial links to Chavez during the 2006 presidential 
campaign, combined with Chavez's public criticism of Alan 
Garcia, cost Humala that election.  Since 2006, 
sensationalist newspapers such as Correo, La Razon, and 
Expreso as well as the weekly magazine Carretas have actively 
sought evidence of these links in the hopes of wrecking 
Humala's hopes for 2011.  We believe these rumors have the 
ring of truth, and although the latest evidence is less 
tangible than a cash-filled suitcase, it supports the theory 
that Chavez has sought to sustain his favorite presidential 
hopeful until 2011.  At the same time, Nadine's 
counter-accusations of a government-orchestrated campaign 
against her husband are also plausible.  The suggestion here 
is that the government is not above breaking the rules, 
releasing sensitive, confidential, personal information -- or 
containing it, as required -- in pursuit of political 
interests.  This approach risks both victimizing Humala and 
opening up Garcia to charges of hypocrisy or worse.
