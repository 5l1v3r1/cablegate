SUBJECT: ANTI-TERRORISM COURT ISSUES VERDICTS IN EL POLO 
BOMBING 
 
REF: LIMA 3798 
 
¶1.  The National Anti-Terrorism Court convicted Wilbert Elqui 
Meza Magino of participating in the planning of the 3/20/2002 
bombing at the El Polo shopping center across the street from 
the U.S. Embassy, and sentenced him to a 30-year prison term. 
 Seven other co-defendants were acquitted of involvement in 
the El Polo bombing, but three, Lidia Vasquez Zevallos, Lucy 
Romero Acosta, and Ida Lucia Mendoza Mateo were found guilty 
of belonging to the Sendero Luminoso terrorist organization 
and sentenced to prison terms of 20-25 years.  Four of the 
defendants were ordered released:  Roger Torres Velasquez, 
Maria Delia Marino, Giovana Anaya Nalvarte, and Dimas Pastor 
Carrera. 
 
¶2.  COMMENT:  The verdicts in the El Polo case were expected, 
as judicial authorities concluded that there was insufficient 
admissible evidence to link all of the defendants to the 
bombing (Reftel).  Despite their acquittal on the El Polo 
charges, three of the defendants were proved to be important 
political leaders within the remnants of Sendero Luminoso, 
and will consequently serve significant prison terms.  END 
COMMENT.
