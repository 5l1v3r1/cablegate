SUBJECT: DEMARCHE REQUEST: SUMMIT OF THE AMERICAS 
DECLARATION AND PLAN OF ACTION (PERU) 
 
REF: SECSTATE 158875 
 
¶1.  Polcouns delivered the demarche on the Summit of the 
Americas Declaration and Plan of Action (Reftel) to Julio 
Garro, the Foreign Ministry's Director of Multilateral 
Affairs, and to Carlos Chocano, the Ministry's Director of 
OAS Affairs and Action Officer for the Summit of the 
Americas, on 9/2. 
 
¶2.  Garro said that Peru shared the USG's concerns that the 
Summit Declaration was too large, diffuse and unmanageable, 
and would work at the Summit Implementation Review Group 
(SIRG) to reduce its length and try to focus it on five or 
six priority issues.  Chocano agreed on the need to establish 
a workable number of priorities, but observed that the trick 
will be to obtain consensus on a half-dozen issues.  Peru, he 
explained, would want to include international assistance 
cooperation and the treatment of disadvantaged groups among 
the issues addressed by a Summit Declaration.  He expressed 
concern that continued failure by the SIRG to reduce the 
length of the document will inevitably lead to even more 
submissions.  In this respect, Chocano noted, he is already 
receiving pressure from the Ministry of Womens Affairs and 
Social Welfare to propose specific provisions on individual 
disadvantaged groups.
