REF: A) LIMA 3146   B) SECSTATE 132219 
 
¶1.  (U) Per reftel B, we have ascertained that Minister of 
Transportation and Communications Jose Ortiz will not/not 
attend the Western Hemisphere Transportation Initiative 
(WHTI) in Brazil, August 25-26.  Vice Minister of 
Transportation Nestor Palacios will act as the GOP's lead 
delegate. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Vice Minister Nestor Palacios is interested 
in a bilateral meeting with the U.S. delegation. 
Potential topics include support for the development of 
transportation infrastructure and transport logistics. 
The USG currently does not have any DOT funded projects 
in Peru, and we expect that the GOP would solicit 
financial support for upcoming projects.  In the case 
that a bilateral meeting does occur, please note that 
Vice Minister Palacios does not speak English.
