SUBJECT: WFP DEMARCHE: GRULAC REFUSES TO BLOCK ZIMBABWE 
 
REF: STATE 17145 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Econoff delivered reftel demarche requesting Peru's 
support in blocking Zimbabwe's bid for the Vice Presidency of 
the World Food Program to MFA UN Bureau Director for 
Candidacies and Quotas Oswaldo del Aguila on February 15. 
Del Aguila responded that although the Dutch and Canadian 
embassies had already delivered the same demarche, Peru had 
joined the GRULAC decision in Rome earlier that day to 
respect the Africa Group's nomination.  He said that GRULAC 
also noted that WFP Executive Board rules did not allow for 
an election unless there were two or more candidates for a 
position. 
 
¶2. (U)  Del Aguila, who previously represented Peru on WFP 
issues in Rome, said Zimbabwean Ambassador Mary Muchada was 
well respected by the other delegates (as noted in reftel). 
He said she had served well in the G-77 and as the head of 
WFP working groups.  Econoff relayed the above information to 
IO/EDA (Sharon Kotok) on February 15.
