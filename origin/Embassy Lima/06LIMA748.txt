SUBJECT: MONTESINOS LEGAL REQUEST FOR EMBASSY FILES 

Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please handle accordingly. 

¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please see para 5. 

¶2. (U) SUMMARY:  Post has received a four-inch thick legal 
assistance request from the lawyer representing Vladimiro 
Montesinos, convicted, ex-intelligence advisor for former 
President Alberto Fujimori.  The 110 page cover letter, also 
sent to intelligence bodies in the U.S., asks Post to release 
and share Embassy files related specifically to the 
Montesinos and Aybar Cancho brothers arms trafficking case 
and generally to intelligence cooperation between the 
countries during Montesinos' tenure.  Post requests guidance 
on how to respond to the letter from Montesinos' lawyer.  END 
SUMMARY. 

¶3. (U) On 2/6 the Ambassador received a bound letter from 
lawyer Estela Valdivia Alvarez and her client Vladimiro 
Montesinos Torres, copies of which were also sent to the 
Senate Intelligence Committee, the Director for National 
Intelligence, the Director of the Central Intelligence 
Agency, the National Security Adviser, and the First Special 
Superior Court of Lima.  The letter asks the Ambassador: 1) 
to renounce the inviolability of the Embassy's files and 
documents related to the Montesinos and Aybar Cancho brothers 
arms trafficking case and those related to cooperation 
between the U.S. intelligence agency and the Peruvian 
intelligence agency during Montesinos' tenure, and; 2) to 
provide the aforementioned information to Montesinos and his 
lawyer.  In the request, the letter specifically references 
Case 38-2001 in the First Special Superior Court of Lima 
presided by Judge Ines Felipa Villa Bonilla for the crime of 
trafficking arms from Jordan to the FARC in Colombia in 1999. 


¶4. (U) In addition to the letter, the package includes four 
bound annexes of supporting documentation totaling another 
850 pages. The letter provides detailed background on the 
Peruvian intelligence agency (SIN); its accomplishments in 
counternarcotics operations in coordination with the USG; USG 
counternarcotics support managed by the SIN; an Intelligence 
Plan known as "Siberia"; an overview of the SIN operations 
involving the Aybar Cancho brothers; and details of meetings 
between Montesinos and ORA representatives.  In the letter 
Montesinos refutes the charges against him in the specific 
Aybar Cancho brothers case.  The annexes include supporting 
documentation referenced in the letter such as: the 
Constitution and statutes of the International 
Counternarcotics Network (RIAN), letters of congratulations 
from USG officials to the SIN on counternarcotics operations, 
the "Siberia" intelligence plan, and "Siberia" monthly 
progress reports, among many other Peruvian intelligence 
documents related to the case and to joint U.S.-Peru 
operations. 

¶5. (U) Action: Please advise Post how to respond to the 
request for information from Embassy files.  If a copy of the 
bound letter or its annexes is required, please contact Pablo 
Valdez (valdezpm2@state.gov, IVG 549-2515) as early as 
possible to facilitate copying the material. 

¶6. (SBU) Comment: Post is not aware of any USG interest that 
would be served by complying with Montesinos' request. End 
Comment.
