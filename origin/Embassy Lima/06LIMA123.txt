SUMMARY 
---------- 
 
¶1. (U)  A record 24 parties/alliances met the 1/9 deadline to 
apply to register their presidential tickets for the April 
election.  Ex-President Alberto Fujimori's bid to head the Si 
Cumple party ticket was rejected by the Lima Special 
Electoral Board, but is being appealed to the National 
Electoral Board (JNE), which is expected to render a decision 
by the end of the week.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
TWENTY-FOUR CANDIDATES TO CHOOSE FROM 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Twenty-four parties/alliances applied to register 
their presidential candidates with the Lima Special Electoral 
Board (JEE) by the 1/9 filing deadline for the 4/9 elections. 
This is the largest number of presidential candidates in 
Peru's history.  The previous high was 18 in 1980; in 2001 
there were only eight.  The JEE is in the process of 
reviewing the registration applications, publishing an 
announcement of each application that meets the legal 
requirements in the Legal Norms official gazette.  Following 
publication, members of the public have two days in which to 
submit challenges to a an application. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Alberto Fujimori's party, Si Cumple (He Delivers), 
sought to register Fujimori as its presidential candidate. 
The JEE rejected this, in a resolution published on 1/10, 
which concluded that the 2001 vote by Congress disqualifying 
Fujimori from holding public office for 10 years also 
precluded him from running for public office.  Si Cumple's 
leadership vowed to appeal this decision to the National 
Electoral Board (JNE) and threatened to stage massive public 
protests.  Meanwhile, Alianza por el Futuro (the alliance of 
pro-Fujimori parties Cambio 90 and Nuevo Mayoria) submitted 
Congresswoman Martha Chavez as its presidential candidate. 
Chavez made it clear that she is running as Fujimori's proxy. 
 (COMMENT:  This two pronged Fujimorista approach of 
attempting to run Fujimori on the Si Cumple ticket, while 
preparing a fall-back candidacy on the Alianza por el Futuro 
slate has been planned by the Fujimoristas for some time (Ref 
B).  END COMMENT.) 
 
¶5. (SBU) The presidential tickets that have submitted their 
registration requests are:

COMMENT 
---------- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  The plethora of presidential candidates has 
generated criticism from politicians and commentators alike, 
who note that it reflects the disunity of the political 
class, as well as the disorganization and lack of 
representativeness of the traditional political parties. 
Given that parties must obtain at least four percent of the 
legislative vote in order to maintain their registration, it 
is expected that most of the smaller parties will disappear 
after the 4/9 election.  The electoral prospects for the 
registered candidates should become clearer after publication 
of the next nationwide APOYO poll on 1/15.  Additional 
biographic data on some of these candidates is available on 
Post's SIPRNET site 
http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/wha/lima/index.cf m . END COMMENT.
