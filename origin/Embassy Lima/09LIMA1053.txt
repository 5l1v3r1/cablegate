¶1.  (C) Summary.  Former president Alberto Fujimori was 
sentenced on July 20 to seven years and six months for 
embezzlement charges, in connection with a $15 million 
"severance" payment to then-intelligence chief Vladimiro 
Montesinos.  Fujimori admitted guilt on the first day of the 
trial in order, say observers, to ensure a brief trial with 
no witnesses.  While prosecutors argued that Fujimori's 
payment was meant to silence Montesinos about internal 
corruption, Fujimori claimed he paid off Montesinos to avert 
a coup.  Prosecutors indicated they would open an additional 
corruption investigation based on Fujimori's re-payment of 
the $15 million.  End summary. 

¶2.  (C) Former president Alberto Fujimori was sentenced on 
July 20 to seven years and six months for embezzlement 
charges, for improperly paying then-intelligence chief 
Vladimiro Montesinos $15 million in alleged severance pay. 
His sentence also calls for nearly $1 million in reparations. 
 This is Fujimori's third conviction.  In Peru, sentences are 
served concurrently, so 25 years (from April's human rights 
conviction - see reftel) is the maximum time Fujimori would 
serve. 

¶3.  (C)  Fujimori admitted guilt almost immediately during 
the first of only four sessions, thereby ensuring a brief 
trial.  Most observers say this was a strategic move to avoid 
a lengthy trial and prevent witnesses from testifying, which 
could have revealed evidence of additional corruption and 
damaged daughter Keiko Fujimori's 2011 presidential bid. 

¶4.  (C) While prosecutors argued that Fujimori's payment 
(made in September 2000 just after the leak of videos 
implicating Montesinos in a vast web of corruption) was meant 
to ensure Montesinos would not accuse other government 
officials of corruption, Fujimori claimed he paid Montesinos 
off under "unusual and extraordinary" circumstances in order 
to avert a coup and save the country.  He also argued that no 
crime was committed because he repaid $15 million to the 
state after 41 days, and the Peruvian people and state were 
not affected by the temporary loss. 

¶5.  (C) Fujimori's next trial will begin in September on 
three additional corruption charges. Observers expect 
Fujimori to be convicted on all counts.  Prosecutors 
announced plans to open an additional corruption 
investigation into the allegedly illegal origin of the $15 
million Fujimori repaid to the government after the 
Montesinos payoff in 2000.
