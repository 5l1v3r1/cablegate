Sensitive But Unclassified, Please Handle Accordingly 
 
1 (SBU) Per reftel instructions to coordinate an approach to 
local officials on GF IV with the resident Brazilian mission, 
D/Polcouns contacted Brazilian Political Counselor Ademar 
Cruz in early April.  Cruz advised that he had provided 
background and invitations to attend GF IV to the Justice, 
Interior and Foreign Ministries.  Cruz said he had not 
received information from Brasilia about the possibility of a 
joint approach here with the USG to promote the meeting, and 
wished to consult with his Ministry before doing so.  After 
several follow-ups, Cruz informed Emboff 5/16 that he had 
received instructions noting the GOB's satisfaction with the 
USG's interest in supporting GF IV, noting that the GOB did 
not rule out the possibility of a joint demarche to the GOP 
at some point in the future, but advising Cruz not to do so 
at this time. 
 
¶2. (U) In the interim, Embassy provided a copy of reftel 
points urging high-level GOP participation in GF IV to 
Foreign Ministry Director of Multilateral Political and 
Security Affairs Julio Garro.  Garro told D/Polcouns in early 
May that the GOP had been an enthusiastic participant in 
previous Global Forum meetings, and at least one Minister 
would likely attend. 
 
¶3. (U) According to Brazilian Polcouns Cruz on 5/17, Justice 
Minister Eduardo Salhuana plans to attend GF IV, accompanied 
by Senior Advisor Jose Luis Pastor.  Cruz is waiting for 
confirmation on attendance by Interior Minister Felix Murazzo.
