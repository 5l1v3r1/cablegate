¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche October 2 to MFA 
Director for Asian Affairs Raul Bressani, who said the GOP 
was following closely the events unfolding in Burma. 
Bressani added that Peru's embassies in Kuala Lumpur and 
Bangkok were reporting regularly on the issue.  (Peru has no 
resident representation in Burma.)  Bressani said that the 
MFA was working closely with its missions in Geneva and New 
York, and supported the UK/Mexico/Guatemala/Chile initiative. 
 Bressani said that Peru hoped for a peaceful transition to a 
democratic civilian government in Burma, but added that China 
should take an active role to ameliorate the situation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bressani reported that the MFA was working on a 
statement on Burma to be delivered at the UN, but added that 
the MFA had not yet decided whether the statement would be 
delivered in the GA or Security Council or, indeed, if it 
would be delivered at all.  He promised to inform poloff of 
the decision, which post will report via septel.  Finally, 
Bressani undertook to pass to the MFA Directorate of 
Multilateral Affairs our request that they support a formal 
briefing to the Security Council by Special Envoy Gambari.
