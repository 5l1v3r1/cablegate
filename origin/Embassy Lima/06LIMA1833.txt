¶1. (U) Poloff delivered reftel points to the Foreign 
Ministry's Director of UN Affairs, Miguel Barreto on 3/10. 
On 3/11 Barreto told Poloff that the GOP in general supports 
the points, specifically the importance of restoring Lebanese 
sovereignty and independence.  Barreto said he had not yet 
seen the draft text of the resolution but believed we were 
"on the same path" based on reftel points.   Unsolicited, 
Barreto said that any effort to address the assassination of 
former Lebanon Prime Minister Rafik Hariri via a tribunal 
should be handled as a separate issue. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Poloff coordinated these demarche conversations with 
United Kingdom Polcouns Jonathan Clare.  Clare said that 
France Polcouns Christophe Billaude delivered a similar 
demarche to Barreto independently on 5/11 and gave Barreto a 
copy of the draft resolution.  Clare shared with Poloff an 
email readout from Bilaude's meeting.  In addition to the 
previous demarche responses (para 1) Barreto told Bilaude 
that it is important for Peru to have a balanced resolution. 
Barreto asked Bilaude about Russia and Qatar's positions on 
the draft resolution, specifically their positions on the 
need for a new resolution.
