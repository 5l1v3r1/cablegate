SUBJECT: PERUVIAN COMMITMENT TO UN MISSION IN HAITI 
 
REF: PORT AU PRINCE 2011 
 
Classified By: A/DCM Alexander Margulies.   Reason:  1.4(b/d). 
 
¶1.  (C)  Peruvian Defense Minister Roberto Chiabra, in recent 
conversations with Emboffs (most recently on 8/5 with the 
Ambassador), has echoed the concern expressed by UN SRSG 
Valdes that Chile and Argentina are leaning towards 
withdrawing their troops from MINUSTAH by June 2006 (Reftel). 
 According to Chiabra, the Chilean and Argentine governments 
have already made the decision to pull out, perhaps as early 
as December 2005. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Chiabra said that Peru was willing to stay the 
course and even to provide additional forces, but cautioned 
that this positive "political" decision was conditioned on 
receiving increased financial resources.  He explained that 
the Armed Forces have the troops needed, but the Defense 
Ministry's budget is insufficient to provide the financial 
float required to fund such a deployment until UN 
reimbursement is received.  Chiabra added that he is 
discussing this issue with the Finance Ministry. 
 
¶3.  (C)  COMMENT:  The GOP and the Peruvian military are 
enthusiastic proponents of Peruvian participation in UN 
peacekeeping missions, viewing this as a way to enhance the 
country's international standing, as well as to modernize and 
professionalize the Armed Forces.  This pro-PKO policy will 
likely sustain Peruvian participation in MINUSTAH even if 
fellow-Latin Americans Chile and Argentina pull out, provided 
suitable replacements can be found.  Financial constraints, 
however, need to be resolved for Peru to increase the size of 
its Haiti deployment.  END COMMENT.
