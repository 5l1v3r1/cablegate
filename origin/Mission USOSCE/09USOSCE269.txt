REF: A. STATE 121301 
     ¶B. STATE 121091 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Forum for Security Cooperation's Working Group B 
(WGB) preceded the plenary in order to determine whether any 
of the draft decisions intended to be presented to the OSCE 
Ministerial Council in Athens could be moved forward.  Of the 
four draft substantive items on the agenda only the FSC input 
for the Athens Ministerial Council Declaration 
(MC.GAL/5/09/Rev.2) moved to the FSC plenary where it was 
approved for Athens. The UK Chair (Gare) retained the FSC's 
Issues Relevant Decision, Ukraine's Non-Proliferation 
Declaration, and Russia's proposed VD99 Review on the agenda 
for a WGB to be convened in Athens at a date and time to be 
determined. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Discussions on the draft "Issues Relevant to the 
FSC" (MC.DD/8/09/Rev.5) and on the Non-Proliferation Draft 
Declaration (FSC.DEL/199/09/Rev.2) were deferred due to the 
absence of formal instructions among some delegations. 
Russia (Ulyanov) again instigated a lengthy discussion on its 
proposal for a Ministerial Decision on VD99 
(FSC.DEL/203/09/Rev.1/Corr.1 -- now listing Kazakhstan as a 
co-sponsor alongside Belarus). There was no expressed change 
of position among delegates, but Russia noted its 
determination to keep the issue on the agenda for discussion 
in Athens. Interestingly Germany (Risse) nuanced its 
intervention on VD99 review calling for a "clear mandate from 
the Ministerial Council whether in a separate decision or 
other clear statement."  Germany, however, did not respond to 
a U.S. (Ellis) question on whether Germany had language to 
propose in lieu of a separate decision. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Under WGB Agenda Item 7, "Any other business," 
Finland reported on an additional euros 62K for the SALW/SCA 
project targeting refurbishment of a storage facility in 
Moldova  Moldova (Cuc) requested other donors to help in 
financing the project and noted Spain was expected to make a 
similar contribution.  Croatia reported on its National 
Expert Workshop on Cyber-Security that was held on 23-24 
November in Zagreb, noting that UN, EU, COE and OSCE 
officials -- including the ATU's participation -- helped make 
the workshop a success.  The U.S. (Ellis) made a point to 
thank Croatia for keeping cyber-security on the agenda, and 
added that the U.S. would be returning to this topic in due 
course. 
 
Working Group "A" -- Drafts agreed 
 
¶4. (SBU) WGA moved to plenary the two draft decisions on its 
agenda -- Agenda and Modalities of the 20th AIAM 
(FSC.DD/9/09/Rev.2) and the update on FSC Decision 15/02 on 
Expert Advice on Implementationof Sectino V of the OSCE 
Document on SALW (FSC.DD/12/09).  (NOTE:  The FSC Plenary 
subsequently approved both decisions. End Note.) 
 
¶5. (SBU) The CPC reported on the Vienna Document training 
conference it held in Ashgabat from 18-19 November, focusing 
on instruments and exchanges.  The CPC also worked with 
Turkmenistanis to acquaint them with the exchange of military 
information and SALW issues.  Finally, the CPC announced that 
it had determined that Turkmenistan's connection to the OSCE 
Communications Network was deemed "technically feasible." 
 
¶6. (SBU) The next meeting of WGA is scheduled for December 9, 
following the FSC Plenary and WGB.
