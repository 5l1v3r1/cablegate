SECURITY SPEECH 
 
REF: STATE 056557 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Russia announced it would provide 
amplifying details to President Medvedev's call during a 
recent speech in Germany for a "legally binding instrument on 
European security."   The Russian proposed chair's statement 
on enforcing the time lines for requesting Vienna Document 
inspections was endorsed by the working group.  There was no 
comment on Russia proposals to define the "specified area" 
for Vienna Document inspections and to require annual prior 
notice of at least one "major military activity."  Russia and 
several other delegations announced they could support the 
latest version of the German proposal to update the 
conventional arms transfers reporting categories to accord 
with the UN Register of Conventional Arms.  The chair will 
reissue the paper as its draft decision. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Belarusian proposal for a one-off information 
exchange on end user certificates received mild support. The 
U.S. questioned the need for the exchange, noting that an 
earlier decision calls for submission of exemplar 
certificates to the OSCE website.  France and Belgium will 
soon circulate a further revision of their proposal of an 
information exchange and Best Practice Guide on measures to 
prevent the illicit trafficking by air of small arms and 
light weapons. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The chair's draft decision on publication of the 
Best Practices Guides on conventional ammunition will be 
considered in the Plenary on June 18.  The Swedish-Dutch 
proposal for a decision endorsing the Best Practices Guides 
on the physical security and destruction of conventional 
ammunition received some comment and has been revised. 
Delegations will again meet informally to discuss the latest 
revisions to the proposed update to the Code of Conduct 
Questionnaire.  End Summary. 
 
Medvedev Speech on European Security 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Russia (Ulyanov) announced the distribution of 
President Medvedev's recent speech in Germany calling for a 
"legally binding instrument on European security." 
(SEC.DEL/85/08) 
A pan-European pact, Ulyanov said, could bring clarity to 
principles controlling the use of force within the 
Euro-Atlantic community, including arms control and other 
important security issues.  A Europe-wide summit meeting 
could start the process toward such a treaty, with all 
European states participating in their national capacities, 
not as members of alliances or blocs.  Further details, 
Ulyanov said, will soon follow. 
 
Chair's Statement on Vienna Document Inspection Timelines 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) Canada joined other delegations and endorsed the 
Russian proposal for a chair's statement calling for strict 
enforcement of the timelines for requesting inspection under 
the Vienna Document.  The chair will issue the statement in 
the Plenary on June 18.  (FSC.DEL/75/08/Rev.3) 
 
Russian Vienna Document Proposals 
--------------------------------- 
 
 
USOSCE 00000158  002 OF 003 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) There was no discussion of the Russian proposals "to 
improve implementation of the Vienna Document" by defining 
the "specified area" for inspections (FSC.DEL/493/07/Rev.2) 
and by requiring at least one annual prior notification of a 
"major military activity" (FSC.DEL/495/07/Rev.3).  The papers 
will remain on the working group agenda. 
 
CAT Category Update 
------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Germany (Schweizer) announced a revision of its 
proposal for updating the CAT reporting categories to accord 
with the UN Register on Conventional Arms.  The latest 
revision reflects the concerns of delegations that more 
explanation was needed of the intent behind operative 
paragraphs 4 and 5, which request the provision of SALW 
transfer information to the UN.  Schweizer said this was done 
by including more language from UN General Assembly 
Resolution 61/77 in the proposal.  The proposal now has wide 
and unqualified support.  It has been reissued as a chair's 
draft decision and moved to the Plenary at the earliest 
opportunity.  (FSC.DD/7/08) 
 
End-User Certificates 
--------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Germany and Denmark supported the Belarusian 
proposal for an information exchange and Best Practices Guide 
on end-user certificates.  The U.S. (Silberberg) noted that, 
following an earlier decision FSC.DEC/5/04), pS had agreed to 
post sample certificates on the OSCE website; in light of 
this, was a one-off information exchange necessary?  The U.S. 
also questioned the need for a Conflict Prevention Center 
overview as the proposal asked for sample formats and an 
analysis of these would likely require comparison of national 
practices.  Perhaps a better approach would be to call for 
the creation of a dedicated webpage and task pS to provide 
information for the page.  Belarus (Pavlov) said it would 
consider the U.S. comments.  (FSC.DEL/108/08) 
 
Illicit Air Trafficking 
----------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) France (Simonet) said a revision of the proposal for 
an information exchange and Best Practices Guide for measures 
to prevent the illicit trafficking of SALW by air will be 
distributed before the next working group meeting on June 18. 
 The present version of the proposal had wide support, 
although Turkey, while supporting in principle, reported it 
was waiting for instructions.  (FSC.DEL/62/08/Rev.1) 
 
SALW in Belarus 
--------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) Sweden (Nilsson), as FSC coordinator for SALW, 
reported on a donors' visit to Belarus in May to inspect the 
OSCE-UNDP capacity building project on SALW stockpile 
management and security (FSC.DEL/112/08).  Nilsson noted 
phase 1 of the project will require more time and additional 
finances will be needed for all phases.  Belarus (Pavlov) 
reported that it will increase its national contribution to 
the project, mostly in the form of in-kind donations of 
logistics and administrative support. 
 
Best Practices Guides 
 
USOSCE 00000158  003 OF 003 
 
 
--------------------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) The chair's draft decision on publication of a 
handbook of Best Practices Guides (BPG) on conventional 
ammunition was endorsed by the working group and will move to 
the Plenary for approval on June 18.  The U.S., per reftel 
guidance, joined consensus after the operative paragraph 
referring to the Biennial Meeting of States was deleted 
(FSC.DD/6/08/Rev.2).  The chair subsequently revised the 
draft decision slightly in light of comments on the proposal 
to endorse two additional ammunition BPGs, described below 
(FSC.DD/6/08/Rev.3). 
 
¶12. (SBU) The Swedish-Dutch proposal for endorsement of the 
BPGs on the physical security and destruction of stockpiles 
of conventional ammunition (FSC.DEL/111/08) received 
qualified support from Germany, which proposed several 
stylistic edits to reflect the companion draft decision, 
described above, on publication of the ammunition BPG 
handbook (FSC.DD/6/08/rev.2).  A revised version, reflecting 
the German edits, has been issued as a chair's draft decision 
(FSC.DD/8/08). 
 
Code of Conduct 
--------------- 
 
¶13. (SBU) Austria (Eischer), FSC coordinator for the Code of 
Conduct, announced another informal meeting on June 13 to 
consider revisions to the proposal to update the Code 
Questionnaire.  An informal meeting on June 5 made changes to 
the text, which will provide the point of departure for the 
June 13 discussion (FSC.DEL/98/08/Rev.1). 
 
Next Meeting 
------------ 
 
¶14. (U) The next FSC meeting will be on June 18.
