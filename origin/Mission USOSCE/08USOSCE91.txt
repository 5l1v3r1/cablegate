SUBJECT: FSC: APRIL 9 - RUSSIA JUMPS QUEUE TO BLAST ANY 
U.S. SECURITY AID TO KOSOVO 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Russia opened the Forum for Security 
Cooperation spring-summer session even before the new chair 
had a chance to speak by attacking the U.S. for its 
announcement that Kosovo, as an independent country, was now 
eligible for defense assistance.  Russia described this as an 
illegal and provocative act, meant to aid the "forces of 
repression" in Kosovo. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Estonia began its chairmanship with opening remarks 
calling for Russia to return to implementation of CFE, 
continued emphasis on core programs of the OSCE including the 
Vienna Document 1999, the Code of Conduct, and the OSCE 
Documents on Small Arms and Light Weapons and Stockpiles of 
Conventional Weapons.  Estonia also plans to make cyber 
security a focus of its chairmanship, and has proposed a 
special working group meeting and a related agenda for the 
Annual Security Review Conference.  Estonia hopes the U.S. 
provide a Security Dialogue speaker on the subject.  End 
summary. 
 
Russia Condemns U.S. Defense Cooperation with Kosovo 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Russia (Ulyanov) declared it had serious concerns 
over possible U.S. supply to the Kosovo defense sector 
(FSC.DEL/63/08, FSC.JOUR/547/08 Annex 1).  Citing UN Security 
Council Resolutions 1242 (paragraphs 9b and 15) and 1367, 
Ulyanov said U.S. security assistance would undermine the 
effectiveness of UN and KFOR efforts to demilitarize Kosovo 
and contribute to further tensions in the region.  U.S. 
security assistance would also violate the spirit of the OSCE 
Document on Small Arms and Light Weapons and the OSCE 
principles on arms transfers, which require, he said, 
participating States to refrain from transfers that could 
suppress human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Ulyanov 
predicted that any U.S. military assistance to Kosovo would 
have an adverse impact on the OSCE and the Dayton Article IV 
agreement.  Russia, he concluded, must assume "these military 
supplies" are intended for domestic repressive ends." 
Comment: Raising a substantive issue in this manner at the 
opening of the session was considered poor form by many, if 
not most, of the delegates.  End comment. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In a brief reply, the U.S. (Neighbour) noted that 
Russia's comments were unexpected in the opening moments of 
the new session but had in any case been addressed by the 
U.S. in the Permanent Council on April 3, and referred 
delegations to document PC.DEL/245/08.  Neighbour said any 
security assistance would be in line with the Ahtisaari plan, 
which calls for a ministry of defense and a small, 
lightly-armed force under strict civilian control that is 
able to participate in civil-military activities including 
humanitarian relief.  He said he would defer any detailed 
reply until the next FSC meeting on April 16. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The UK (Gare) expressed sympathy for the U.S. 
position, and endorsed the Ahtisaari plan and its provisions 
for a well-disciplined security force as essential to the 
future of Kosovo and the larger region (FSC.JOUR/547/08 Annex 
2).  Ulyanov countered with bitter criticism of the Ahtisaari 
plan, claiming it had no legal status. 
 
 
Opening Statement: But First, a Few Words about CFE 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
USOSCE 00000091  002 OF 004 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) Estonia assumed the chairmanship of the FSC for the 
spring-summer session that runs until the end of July.  Mr. 
Lauri Almann, the thirty-something permanent under-secretary 
of the Estonian defense ministry (FSC.DEL/61/08/Add.1), in 
the opening statement (FSC.DEL/61/08) began with concern over 
Russian suspension of implementation of the CFE Treaty, 
described as the cornerstone of European security.  Almann 
repeated the Estonian undertaking to accede to the adapted 
CFE Treaty after it enters into force and accession of new 
members becomes legally possible. 
 
UNSCR 1540 on the Work Plan 
--------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Almann said Estonia would continue with the work 
program begun under the Spanish chairmanship in January. 
This would include strengthening the Security Dialogue to 
include discussion of the "most urgent security matters." 
Estonia will continue efforts to improve implementation--and 
facilitate discussion of possible new initiatives--of core 
OSCE documents, including the Code of Conduct, the Vienna 
Document 1999, and the OSCE Documents on Small Arms and Light 
Weapons (SALW) and Stockpiles of Conventional Ammunition 
(SCA).  Almann also pledged support to "relevant global 
processes" including UN Security Council Resolution 1540 on 
preventing proliferation of WMD to non-state actors. 
 
Issue de Session: Cyber Security 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Almann described cyber security as a new challenge 
the OSCE must address. Citing the international cooperation 
Estonian received in the wake of the cyber attack on it over 
a year ago, Almann invited participating States to contribute 
to responses to the cyber threat.  Estonia has already 
circulated a Food-for-Thought paper (FSC.DEL/60/08) that it 
plans to discuss in Working Group B.  It will also include 
cyber security on the agendas of the joint Permanent 
Council-FSC meeting (June 4) and the second 
political-military session of the Annual Security Review 
Conference (July 1-2). 
 
Security Dialogue Schedule 
-------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Separately, Estonia has distributed a schedule for 
15 FSC meetings, including Security Dialogue presentations on 
the Baltic naval Mine Countermeasures Squadron (April 16), 
currently commanded by an Estonian, UNIDIR on the ATT process 
(May 7), the Baltic Defense College (May 21), the MONDEM 
program in Montenegro (May 28), and landmines (July 9) 
(FSC.INF/4/08).  The Estonian delegation also warned USDel 
that Azerbaijan may have "something to say" at the April 16 
Security Dialogue.  Estonia is very anxious to hear if the 
U.S. plans to make presentations at the Security Dialogue, 
particularly on cyber security. 
 
Russian Complaints 
------------------ 
 
¶10. (SBU) Ulyanov, apparently tone deaf, said he disliked 
starting with polemics but had to respond to Estonian 
comments on CFE.  Russia, he said, only suspended because of 
the NATO politically motivated moratorium on ratification of 
 
USOSCE 00000091  003 OF 004 
 
 
the adapted CFE Treaty.  There was nothing, he added, to 
prevent Estonia from voluntarily implementing the present 
treaty while it waited for entry into force of the adapted 
version.  When Estonia begins consultations with present CFE 
States Parties, it will find Russia a serious and 
professional interlocutor. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Turning to the rest of the Estonian opening 
statement, Ulyanov called for a full exchange of views among 
participating States on current security issues in the 
Security Dialogue, not just reliance on invited guest 
speakers.  He supported full implementation of OSCE 
documents, and in this regard said Russia would renew its 
proposal for naval confidence- and security building 
mechanisms. 
 
¶12. (SBU) Ulyanov doubted that the FSC was the correct forum 
for cyber security discussion, although he acknowledged it 
was a legitimate concern.  As the subject dealt mostly with 
non-military aspects of security, Ulyanov suggested the 
Permanent Council's Security Committee would be a better 
forum.  Several delegations after the meeting told U.S. rep 
(Hnatczuk) that they agreed with Ulyanov on this point. 
 
¶13. (SBU) Slovenia on behalf of the EU, as well as Spain, 
Finland, and the U.S. welcomed Estonia to the chair and 
expressed support for its work program. 
 
Mine Action Day 
--------------- 
 
¶14. (SBU) Slovenia on behalf of the EU noted the observation 
of "Mine Action Day" on April 4 and called on participating 
States to accede to the Ottawa Convention. 
 
Ukraine Melange MOU Signed 
-------------------------- 
 
¶15. (SBU) Ukraine announced that the long-awaited MOU between 
it and the OSCE for melange disposition had been signed. 
Contract tenders were expected soon. 
 
ASEAN-OSCE Cooperation 
---------------------- 
 
¶16. (SBU) Germany reported a workshop on confidence-building 
measures and preventive diplomacy with the ASEAN Regional 
Forum sponsored by the EU and Indonesia.  The event, held in 
Berlin March 12-14, included OSCE representatives, who 
reported much interest from ASEAN delegations in OSCE 
information exchanges and the use of questionnaires.  An 
informal working group will be formed to further information 
exchange between the OSCE and ASEAN. 
 
Melange Project in Albania 
-------------------------- 
 
¶17. (SBU) Lieutenant Colonel Niels Peterson (Denmark), as FSC 
coordinator for SCA, reported the findings of an OSCE visit 
to Albania in response to its request for assistance in the 
elimination of over 30 thousand liters of melange.  Peterson 
reported that, because the melange was stored in "precarious" 
conditions at three facilities near Tirana, the OSCE planed 
to award a sole source contract to the Swedish firm Sarcap. 
The melange will be transported to Sweden for elimination. 
 
USOSCE 00000091  004 OF 004 
 
 
The cost of the project is estimated at 60 thousand euros. 
Two pS have made preliminary offers to defray the costs. 
Albania (Galanxhi) expressed its appreciation. 
 
Next Meeting 
------------ 
 
¶18. (SBU) The chair announced FSC recommendations for the 
agenda and modalities of the 2008 Annual Security Review 
Conference (July 1-2) will be discussed in Working Group B at 
the next FSC meeting on April 16.
