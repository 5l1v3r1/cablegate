¶1.  (U)  Summary:  Recent IPCs and discussions during the COM 
conference in Washington during January emphasized the need to 
promote greater coordination between NATO and the OSCE, especially 
in view of the Russian proposals for a European Security Treaty and 
for a treaty in the NRC.  As NATO prepares its new Strategic Concept 
for the November Summit in Portugal and as the OSCE prepares for 
intensive European Security discussions (i.e., the Corfu Process, an 
anticipated Informal Ministerial in July, and perhaps a Summit in 
October), this need will become increasingly urgent.  USOSCE 
recommends we take advantage of two opportunities to do so, 
beginning with a TDY by a US NATO representative to a NATO Defense 
College seminar in Vienna February 3-4 and consultations with 
USOSCE.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U)  On January 27, France proposed to the other 27 members of 
the NATO Caucus at the OSCE to develop during its February 
chairmanship the concept of cross visits between Brussels and 
Vienna, beginning with a visit to Brussels by the troika of past, 
present, and incoming Chairs of the Caucus-countries hold the chair 
on a rotating basis which changes every month.  No such troika 
exists in NATO Brussels, but France suggested one option could be 
the dean of NATO PermReps, someone from the IS, and a third 
undefined member.  The troika would meet with the full 28 in 
Brussels to exchange views on European security being dealt with in 
both bodies and to initiate regular contacts.  France suggested that 
the first visit could be made in March under Hungary's chairmanship 
of the Caucus, with participation by outgoing chair France and 
incoming chair Greece (the 2009 Chair of the OSCE and current Chair 
of the OSCE Forum for Security Cooperation through March 2010). 
Such an arrangement, which would need to be worked out in detail 
during France's chairmanship in February, would not preclude the 
possibility of an eventual exchange visit by all 28 PermReps of NATO 
Brussels to Vienna and vice versa. 
 
¶3.  (U)  A more immediate opportunity for promoting coordination 
stems from the seminar being jointly organized in Vienna February 
3-4 as part of the Partnership for Peace by the NATO Defense College 
and the Government of Austria:  "Indivisibility of European 
Security."  Topics on the agenda include: Euro-Atlantic and 
Pan-European Architectures; Arms Control and Transparency; 
Comprehensive Security and the Human Dimension; and Energy Security. 
 Invitations were issued by the NATO Defense College to NATO 
permanent missions in Brussels in December, whereas invitations to 
OSCE Missions were only received last week.  We view this event as 
an excellent opportunity for someone from US NATO to participate in 
these discussions that pertain to both organizations, and to consult 
with USOSCE on how the Corfu Process may affect NATO's agenda. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Action Request:  USOSCE requests US NATO consider sending a 
mission representative to Vienna February 3-4 to attend the seminar 
and consult with USOSCE staff.  POC USOSCE:  Political Military 
Officer Chris Ellis (+43 31339-3364).
