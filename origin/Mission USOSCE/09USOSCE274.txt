SUBJECT: FSC OF DECEMBER 9: WINDING DOWN 2009; WINDING UP 
2010 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  At 2009's penultimate meeting of the FSC 
on December 9, the UK Chair (Cliff) reviewed the its 
accomplishments and reflected on the 2010 workload. There 
were no items for discussion in Working Group "B."  Working 
Group "A" had a quick exchange on Ukraine's 
"Food-for-Thought" paper on "interpretations of some 
provision is VD99, Chapter I "Annual Exchange of Military 
Information.  Ukraine announced it would provide more detail 
at the Meeting of the Heads of Verification Centers on 
December 14.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The December 9 FSC was chaired by UK Ambassador Ian 
Cliff as the final substantive plenary of the UK's 
chairmanship.  Greece assumes the chair in 2010 (to be 
followed by Hungary and Ireland).  Cliff reviewed the 
accomplishments including the Ministerial Decisions on Small 
Arms/Light Weapons and Stockpiles of Conventional Ammunition, 
the Issues Relevant to the FSC, which lays out a "full 
program of events, discussions and tasks" in 2010 on 
strengthening the political-military toolbox including VD99, 
and the noteworthy first declaration on Non-Proliferation. 
Cliff remarked that events "underscored the relevance of the 
FSC" and the important contribution of arms control experts 
in the broader Corfu process. 
 
Ukraine on Vienna Document and deployed forces 
 
¶3. (SBU) No issues were raised in Working Group "B."  Under 
Agenda Item 2 (Vienna Document) of Working Group "A," Ukraine 
reintroduced its "Food-for-Thought" paper on improving the 
interpretation of information on military units to include 
those deployed that were not located in their normal 
peacetime location (FSC.DEL/196/09).  Ukraine planned to 
discuss in more detail the paper at the Meeting of Heads of 
Verification Centers (HOVC) on December 14, with the 
intention of introducing a draft FSC decision after the 
winter holidays.  (Note:  WGA's UK Chair (Hartnell) welcomed 
Ukraine presenting its paper at the HOVC, noting the dearth 
of Food-for-Thought papers for the meeting.  End note.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Greece and Germany requested clarifications on 
elements within the Ukrainian paper.  Greece asked about the 
time-lines for reporting on deployed units, and whether the 
reporting requirements would include military exercises and, 
separately, deployments in peace support operations.  Germany 
asked for an elaboration of the terms "remote elements 
deployed separately," whether the units were independent 
battalions of other forces, and what would be the 
consequences under the Ukraine proposal for inspection visits 
and would it require an automatic increase in quotas? 
Ukraine took note of the questions and said these would be 
addressed at the HOVC Meeting. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Austria announced that it would hold on December 14, 
a symposium titled "Ten Years Vienna Document 1999: 
Confidence and Security Building ) Past, Present and Future" 
(FSC.DEL/209/09), to be held at the National Defense Academy. 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) The CPC noted, under Any Other Business, its Monthly 
Report on Activities was circulated December 1 
(FSC.GAL/133/09); reminded delegates that the draft agenda 
for the HOVC was circulated (FSC.GAL/132/09); and noted it 
was circulating for the HOVC Meeting a Food-for-Thought paper 
on quota distributions for air base visits (FSC.GAL/139/09). 
 
¶7. (SBU) The final FSC plenary for the calendar year under 
the UK Chairmanship will be held December 16.  The two 
Working Groups will not be scheduled to meet until after 
Greece assumes the Chair in 2010.
