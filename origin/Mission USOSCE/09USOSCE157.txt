SUMMIT RESULTS 
 
1.(SBU) Summary:  At the 8 July Forum for Security 
Cooperation (FSC) Plenary, U.S. and Russia highlighted 
pol-mil results of the July 6 Summit. The FSC adopted 
Decision 5/09 to hold a "Meeting to Review the OSCE Document 
on SALW" on September 22-23.   The FSC heard two Security 
Dialogue presentations on Southeastern Europe Defense 
Ministerial Coordination Committee (SEDM-CC) and the 
South-Eastern Europe Brigade (SEEBRIG).  The UK and Russia 
published a new version of the Best Practice Guide for 
Implementation of VDOC Chapter IV on Contacts. Mission 
welcomes further comments on this draft. The UK announced the 
publication of its "Defense Framework" which is the 
authoritative source of information on how the UK defense 
apparatus works, including democratic political control of 
the military forces.  Russia patiently awaits further 
substantive comments on its naval CSBM proposal.  End Summary. 
 
July 6 Summit Productive 
- - - - - 
 
2.(SBU) Both U.S. and Russian delegations informed 
delegations on the results of the U.S.-Russia Summit on July 
¶6. The U.S.(Neighbour) stated that with our Russian partners 
we found success in a number of areas, including some arms 
control issues, including the Joint Statements on START 
negotiations (SEC.DEL/153/09), Nuclear Security 
(SEC.DEL/151/09), Missile Defense SEC.DEL/149/09), Military 
to Military Cooperation, and a Presidential Commission 
(SEC.DEL/157/09).  In particular, one issue for the FSC 
involves the paragraph in the Nuclear Security statement 
about "(working together to strengthen the ability of other 
nations to carry out their WMD non-proliferation obligations 
under UNSCR 1540."  Neighbour emphasized that completing the 
1540 Best Practice Guide will be a major contribution to that 
effort. 
 
3.(SBU) Ambassador Ulyanov similarly said Russia found the 
Summit to be useful, businesslike, and good beginning for 
open dialogue between our Presidents.  Russia and the U.S. 
have many common interests, many agreements were reached, 
including one for transit of U.S. military equipment en route 
to Afghanistan.  Russia hopes for new momentum for 
cooperation on arms control, and that the results will help 
accelerate and advance a way around the CFE impasse.  He also 
hopes the FSC agenda will benefit, and that various documents 
in the CSBM regime can be updated as well. Following the 
meeting, Russia recommended we jointly share the relevant 
documents in the FSC. (FSC.DEL/137/09). 
 
4.(SBU) The FSC adopted Decision 5/09 on "An OSCE Meeting to 
Review the OSCE Document on Small Arms and Light Weapons and 
its Supplementary Decisions."  In order to prepare for the 
September 22-23 meeting, the Chair (Georgia) urged 
delegations to identify panelists, moderators, and presenters 
in the near future. 
 
5.(SBU) The Southeastern Europe Defense Ministerial 
Coordination Committee (SEDM-CC) briefing contained extensive 
background and information on a number of projects underway 
among the 12 members states, including the U.S.  Projects 
include simulated exercises; WMD counter-proliferation, 
border security and counter-terrorism; interconnection of 
military hospitals; defense industry, research and 
 
USOSCE 00000157  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
technology; and military education cooperation 
(FSC.DEL/135/09).  The Southeastern Europe Brigade was also 
created under SEDM auspices.  The SEEBRIG briefing included 
details on the multinational forces involved and their recent 
missions, including security and assistance operations in 
Afghanistan.  (FSC.DEL/136/09)  Several pS welcomed the 
briefings and pledged continued support.  Neighbour 
highlighted that the project on WMD counter-proliferation, 
which includes preparing legislation and export controls, 
could benefit from the UNSCR 1540 Best Practice Guide when it 
is finalized. 
 
6.(SBU) In line with its Code of Conduct commitments, 
including democratic political control of the military 
forces, the UK announced the publication of its &Defense 
Framework8 which is the authoritative source of information 
on how the UK defense apparatus works.  (FSC.JOUR/590, Annex) 
 
7.(SBU) Working Group B:  Russian Naval CSBM proposal: 
Russia informed the FSC that several delegations have said 
its proposal for a  naval CSBM regime is acceptable. 
(FSC.DEL/120/08/Rev 1)  However, it understands that some 
delegations need more time, and asked that it remain on the 
agenda until all are ready.  Ulyanov stressed that its 
proposal is a basis for negotiation and it is open to other 
proposals in this area.  In particular, information on 
difficult substantive points will help Russia reflect on how 
to amend the text to make it more acceptable.  No delegation 
commented on the topic. 
 
Working Group A 
- - - - - 
 
8.(SBU) Russia made note of the large number of notifications 
regarding delayed information exchanges for Conventional Arms 
Transfers and SALW.  Specifically, he recalled that under 
Decision 10/02, pS were supposed to indicate not only the 
reason for the delay, but the estimated date for when the 
data would be provided.  He asked that delegations update 
their delay notices accordingly, and urged the FSC Chair to 
issue the reminder letters promptly after the two-week grace 
period ends on July 14.  Note:  This is the first time any pS 
has complained about "delay" notifications, although there 
have been a lot more than in previous years, including from 
the U.S.  End Note. 
 
9.(SBU) The UK, also on behalf of the Russian cosponsor, 
announced that it would be publishing a new version of the 
Best Practice Guide for Implementation of VDOC Chapter IV on 
Contacts (FSC.AIAM/8/09/Rev 1).  Mission welcomes further 
review/comments on the new draft. 
 
10.(SBU) On the Turkish food for thought and draft Decision 
on extending the use of digital cameras and GPS, Turkey 
thanked the Chair for agreeing to issue the proposed draft 
Decision (FSC.DEL/124/09).  Cyprus asked that the draft 
clearly notes that the equipment can only be used to verify 
the information available from the data exchanges ) not any 
new data, and is used with the knowledge/consent of the host 
state.  The Chair asked that language suggestions be provided 
in writing soon. 
 
11.(SBU) On the German draft Decision on Guidelines for 
 
USOSCE 00000157  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
Briefings, Cyprus requested that the same suggestion made on 
the equipment decision be included in this text as well. 
Germany did not indicate when a new version will be issued 
(FSC.DD/5/09). 
 
12.(SBU) Under other agreed measures, food for thought on 
UNSCR 1540, Belarus welcomed further work in the FSC on 
non-proliferation issues without overlapping work done 
elsewhere.  USdel (Marvin) said we are working with the 
co-sponsors to prepare documents on the operational elements 
suggested in the text.  We also noted that work on the export 
control Best Practice Guide was nearly complete, and we hoped 
to circulate a new text before the summer break. 
 
13.(SBU) The CPC made two short announcements, one regarding 
its participation in an EAPC Workshop on Combating Illicit 
Brokering in SALW on 1-2 July.  The workshop included 
discussion about the current OSCE brokering definition and 
possibly updating it.  The second involves a United Nations 
Coordinating Action on Small Arms (CASA) project in 
cooperation with the NGO Group for Research and Information 
on Peace and Security (GRIP) on the development of 
International Small Arm Control Standards (ISACS). 
(FSC.GAL/82/09) Given the OSCE's extensive experience in 
developing SALW Best Practice Guides, the CPC has been 
invited to attend the next CASA Expert Reference Group 
meeting in Geneva on July 15-16. 
 
¶14. (SBU) CASA has also asked GRIP to develop modules on 
three topics:  1) national controls over the end-user and 
end-use of internationally transferred SALW; 2) marking and 
record-keeping; and 3) tracing.  In turn, GRIP has sent a 
request to the OSCE/CPC asking if the OSCE can share copies 
of SALW information exchanges provided under FSD.DEC/12/08 to 
prepare the first module. FSC.DEC/12/08 is an information 
exchange with regard to sample formats of end-user 
certificates and relevant verification procedures.  The CPC 
asked that pS let them know by 20 July if they have 
reservations with sharing this information with GRIP. 
Mission will not object unless advised otherwise. 
 
15.(SBU) The next FSC Plenary will be on July 15, and will 
include a Security Dialogue presentation by Swedish Brigadier 
General Karl Engelbrektson of the Swedish Armed Forces on 
Women in the Armed Forces.
