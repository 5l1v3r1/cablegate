SUBJECT: OSCE/FSC SEPTEMBER 10: RUSSIA WILL FOCUS ON 
GEORGIA IN AUTUMN ROUND 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: The Forum for Security Cooperation began 
its autumn round on September 10 with an exchange of charges 
and counter-charges between Georgia and Russia. Georgia 
reports that large numbers of Russian forces remain on its 
territory, including South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and are 
engaged in ethnic cleansing.  Russia insisted that its forces 
only responded to Georgia's aggressive attack on South 
Ossetia and remain there and in Abkhazia to protect the lives 
of civilians in the now "independent" territories.  Russia 
charged Georgia with numerous violations of the OSCE Code of 
Conduct for armed forces  and claimed those supplying Georgia 
with weapons were violating the OSCE Document on Small Arms 
and Light Weapons.  Russia promised to return in detail to 
the Georgia conflict in future FSC meetings. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The U.S. called for Russia to comply with the 
French-brokered six-point cease fire agreement, particularly 
the requirement for Russia to withdraw its forces to their 
pre-August 6 locations.  Armenia, on behalf of CSTO, 
expressed concern over Georgia's military actions in the 
South Caucasus and praised Russia's role in bringing peace to 
the region. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Finland assumed the chairmanship of the Forum and 
renewed its pledge to support further work on SALW, 
stockpiles of conventional ammunition, the Code of Conduct, 
and the Vienna Document.  Finland will organize an October 29 
joint meeting with the Permanent council on human rights in 
the armed forces.  Finland will host Vienna Document 1999 
visits to an airbase and military facility September 23-26. 
End summary. 
 
Finnish Chairman's Plans 
------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Pauli Jarvenpaa, head of the defense policy 
department at the Finnish Ministry of Defense, outlined 
Finland's plans for the autumn session.  He noted Finland's 
role as OSCE CiO in working to negotiate a cease fire and 
promote conflict settlement in Georgia.  The crisis there, he 
said, challenges the OSCE to continue the effective 
implementation of its arms control and CSBMs, which have 
continued relevance. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Finland wants to further implementation of existing 
political-military documents, including SALW and conventional 
ammunition, the Code of Conduct, and the Vienna Document. 
The Security Dialogue has been recently revitalized, and 
should be used to "debate all European security issues." 
Finland plans an October 29 joint FSC-PC meeting on human 
rights in the armed forces. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Several delegations welcomed Finland and expressed 
support for its plans.  France (Lebedel), on behalf of the 
EU, agreed with Finland that the events in Georgia had a 
direct impact on the work of the Forum.  Lebedel concurred 
that work should continue on the current acquis of the FSC, 
and specifically supported pending proposals on the Code of 
Conduct, SALW, and cyber security.  Lebedel said that, in 
light of the uncertainty over CFE, the role of CSBMs becomes 
all the more important.  Armenia (Papikyan), on behalf of the 
CSTO, called for the FSC to adopt the Russian CSBMs on rapid 
reaction and naval forces.

U.S. Warns CSBMs Not a Substitute for CFE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The U.S. (Neighbour) welcomed the new chair's 
support for further work on implementation of UNSCR 1540 and 
use of the Security Dialogue.  Neighbour warned that the U.S. 
could not, at this point, support further action on some CSBM 
proposals in the wake of "one participating State's" 
suspension of CFE and actions in Georgia, noting that it was 
not possible to substitute these proposals for full adherence 
to the principles and provisions of CFE. 
 
The Conflict in Georgia 
----------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Georgia (Giorgadze) charged that Russian troops 
remained on its territory without legal basis in a military 
rather than peacekeeping role and are engaged in ethnic 
cleansing by expelling Georgians from their homes near 
Tskhinvali and burning their villages.  Russian forces were 
indiscriminately using heavy weapons against civilian targets 
and population.  He described Russian recognition of the 
independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as contravening 
earlier agreements concerning the territories and 
international law.  Georgia's actions on August 6 were 
intended to terminate "peacekeeping operations" in these 
territories and remove the basis for Russian military 
presence there.  Georgia now views the territories as regions 
under Russian military occupation. Georgia has cut of 
diplomatic relations with Russia. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Giorgadze thanked the EU, the U.S., and other 
participating States for their support of Georgia's 
sovereignty and territorial integrity and for "condemning" 
Russian actions.  He called on Russia to comply with all 
parts of the cease fire negotiated by President Sarkozy.  He 
said there were currently 17,000 Russian troops deployed on 
Georgian territory, of which about 1,000 were outside the 
conflict zones. 
 
Russia Places All Blame on Georgia 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) Russia (Ulyanov) charged that Georgia's military 
actions in South Ossetia have led to large-scale killing of 
the local population and the destruction of Tskhinvali and 
other settlements.  Ulyanov said Georgia has used ethnic 
cleansing in an attempt to rapidly resolve the issue of the 
status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Over 1,500 South 
Ossetians and ten Russian "peacekeepers" were killed and only 
Russian intervention has stopped the killing.  Georgia's 
actions have destroyed any chance for the continued 
co-existence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia within Georgia. 
These territories have now concluded they need to be 
independent.  Although a difficult decision, Russia 
recognized their independence as it was the only way to 
protect the lives of their inhabitants. 
 
Russia Compares South Ossetia-Abkhazia to Kosovo 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶11. (SBU) Some states, among them those who have recognized 
 
USOSCE 00000212  003 OF 005 
 
 
Kosovo, claim Russian recognition of these territories 
violated international law.  But, Ulyanov asked, why is 
Kosovo's declaration of independence acceptable but not South 
Ossetia's and Abkhazia's?  Russia would like an answer. 
 
Russia Will Return to Georgia at Next FSC 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶12. (SBU) Ulyanov asked why Georgia was among the most 
heavily armed states.  He charged some states were supplying 
weapons to Georgia in contravention of the OSCE Document on 
SALW.  Also, Georgia had violated many of the provisions of 
the OSCE Code of Conduct on Politico-Military Aspects of 
Security.  In any case, he added, Russia will leave none of 
these issues alone and will return to them beginning with at 
the next FSC meting. 
 
Sarkozy-Medvedev Agreement 
-------------------------- 
 
¶13. (SBU) Ulyanov praised the results of the Sarkozy-Medvedev 
meeting on September 8.  The resulting agreement called for 
Georgian troops to return to their barracks and prohibited 
the use of force against South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  The 
agreement will establish security zones with international 
monitors, with at least 200 from the EU, in sufficient 
numbers to replace the Russian peacekeepers, who will 
withdraw after the international presence is established.  At 
that point responsibility for the security of South Ossetia 
and Abkhazia will rest with the international community. 
 
U.S.: Russia Must Honor Cease Fire 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶14. (SBU) The U.S. (Neighbour) called on Russia to honor all 
provisions of the six-point cease fire agreement, 
particularly the requirement for Russian forces to withdraw 
to their pre-August 6 positions.  Neighbour noted the 
international community had also called for full compliance. 
He recalled the EU and NATO condemnations of Russia 
recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and their support 
for Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
 
¶15. (SBU) Russia, Neighbour said, had reacted 
disproportionately to Georgia's ill-advised attack on 
Tskhinvali and its actions were not those of a peacekeeper. 
Russia needs to make better choices as its action have 
isolated it, jeopardized its international standing, and 
adversely impacted its economy. 
 
¶16. (SBU) Russia's actions were not merely a response to 
Georgia's attack on Tskhinvali.  Seconded Russia military 
officers commanding South Ossetian forces shelled Georgian 
villages and peacekeepers in early August, and Russia forces 
aided South Ossetian forces as they attacked Georgians after 
the cease fire declared by Georgia on August 7. 
 
¶17. (SBU) The U.S. welcomed the PC decision to increase the 
number of monitors in Georgia and urged Russia to allow the 
additional monitors to deploy. 
 
Georgia Recalls Earlier Russian Air Incursions 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
USOSCE 00000212  004 OF 005 
 
 
 
¶18. (SBU) Georgia replied that Russia had been provoking it 
with incursions into Georgian airspace, attacks on radar 
sites, and constant artillery shelling.  Russia has given 
many residents of the contested territories Russian passports 
while supporting the expulsion of Georgians.  On the issue of 
arms imports, Giorgadze said Georgia is well below its (CFE) 
equipment limits. 
 
Russia Quotes U.S. Congressman on Tonkin Gulf 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶19. (SBU) Ulyanov said he empathized with refugees from South 
Ossetia and Abkazia, but they were the victims of Georgia' 
gamble that was now having a ricochet effect on its own 
citizens.  Ulyanov quoted U.S. Representative Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-CA), who accused Georgia of provoking a 
military incident as "the U.S. did in the Tonkin Gulf 
incident."  Ulyanov accused the U.S. of a double standard in 
its recognition of Kosovo.  Responding to the U.S. 
description of Russian actions as "disproportionate," Ulyanov 
said U.S. military actions in Iraq, Kosovo, Panama, and 
Grenada were hardly proportionate, mentioning specifically 
U.S. attacks on the Belgrade radio station and Chinese 
embassy. 
 
¶20. (SBU) The U.S. replied Russian actions were still 
disproportionate even if, which was not the case, Georgia has 
violated the cease fire.  Regarding Rohrabacher Neighbour 
said U.S. congressmen, all 535 of them, were free to speak 
their opinions. 
 
CSTO Praises Russian "Peacemaking" 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶21. (SBU) Armenia, on behalf of CSTO, expressed concern for 
Georgian military actions that resulted in the deaths of 
Russian soldiers and a "humanitarian disaster."  CSTO praised 
the active role of Russia in "bringing peace to the region." 
 
Vienna Document 
--------------- 
 
¶22. (SBU) Finland announced it would host a Vienna Document 
airbase and military facility visit on September 23-26. 
 
CPC News 
-------- 
 
¶23. (SBU) The Conflict Prevention Center (CPC) announced the 
publication of the OSCE Handbook of Best Practices on 
Conventional Ammunition.  The handbook was published in 
English but editions in the other OSCE languages will be 
issued shortly. 
 
¶24. (SBU) CPC also announced the appointment of Mathew 
Geertsen, recently with the Dutch delegation to the OSCE, as 
the head of the FSC Support Unit and of Glen Sibbetts 
(Canada) as the head of the Communications Network. 
 
Next Meeting

USOSCE 00000212  005 OF 005
