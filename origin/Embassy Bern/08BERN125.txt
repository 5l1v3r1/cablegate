¶1. (SBU) Emboff delivered non-papers in reftel A on March 4 
to Roland Vock, Head of the Sanctions Task Force at the Swiss 
State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO).  Vock's 
deputy, Thomas Graf, participated in the meeting.  Vock said 
that SECO already was working on the necessary steps for the 
GOS to implement UNSCR 1803.  He noted that implementation 
would require a decision by the Federal Council, which he 
anticipated would be forthcoming, though he was not yet able 
to specify a date. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Emboff delivered the non-papers in reftel A on March 
5 to Alessandro Capelli in the MFA International Law 
Division.  Capelli said that relevant Swiss financial 
institutions would be informed of the requirements of UNSCR 
1803 the same day.
