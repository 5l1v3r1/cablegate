¶1. (SBU) Acting POL Counselor discussed the message in reftel 
on May 9 with Rascha Osman, Swiss MFA Iraq Desk Officer. 
Osman reported that MFA State Secretary Ambuehl (Deputy 
Minister equivalent) will lead the Swiss delegation to the 
May 29 International Compact with Iraq (ICI) Ministerial in 
Stockholm.  MFA A/S equivalent for Middle East Affairs Livia 
Leu will accompany Ambuehl, as will the Swiss Ambassador to 
Sweden. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Osman said the success of Iraqi reconstruction is 
important to the Swiss government.  She noted that the GOS 
reached agreement with Iraq in 2007 regarding Iraqi debt to 
Switzerland.  That arrangement included Switzerland forgiving 
80 percent of the Iraqi debt. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Osman said that Switzerland has provided some 
technical assistance within Iraq, but generally has found it 
difficult to provide such assistance via its liaison office 
in Baghdad.  The GOS therefore has focused its support on 
assistance to Iraqi refugees in Jordan and Syria.  Osman 
reported that Switzerland has doubled its assistance to Iraqi 
refugees since last year, expecting to reach USD 4.1 million 
for 2008.  She said that the MFA also is considering a 
training course in federalism for Iraqi government officials, 
sometime later this year.  The training would be based on a 
similar study visit provided to Iraqi officials in 2006.
