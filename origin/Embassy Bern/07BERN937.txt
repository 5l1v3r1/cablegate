¶1. (SBU) Poloff met September 21 with Tim Enderlin, Chief of 
UNSC Affairs for the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign 
Affairs (EDA), and delivered the reftel message encouraging 
the Swiss government to make a contribution to the UN Special 
Tribunal for Lebanon.  Enderlin responded by emphasizing 
Switzerland's abiding, strong support for international law 
and rule of law institutions.  In this context, he said that 
the International Criminal Court (ICC) is Switzerland's "top 
priority."  Enderlin further noted that, aside from the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia 
(ICTY) and the International Tribunal for Rawanda, which are 
funded directly by the UN, Switzerland has not provided 
funding to tribunals, specifically not to such "hybrid" 
tribunals as the Special Court for Sierra Leone or the 
Special Tribunal for Cambodia.  Enderlin mentioned, however, 
that Switzerland has seconded personnel to the Special Court 
for Sierra Leone, and might do so in the case of the Special 
Tribunal for Cambodia.  Taking note of the USG's intention to 
make a "significant" contribution to the Special Tribunal for 
Lebanon, Enderlin concluded by saying that the GOS needs to 
discuss the matter further, and he "cannot exclude" that 
Switzerland will make a contribution, but also could not 
commit that it would do so. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Prior to the meeting with Enderlin, poloff briefed 
the Dutch Embassy DCM on our plans to demarche the GOS to 
encourage a Swiss contribution to the Special Tribunal for 
Lebanon.  Poloff subsequently provided the Dutch DCM a 
readout of Enderlin's comments.  The Dutch DCM said she would 
coordinate with The Hague regarding whether the Dutch Embassy 
here might conduct a follow-up demarche, in a further effort 
to persuade the Swiss government to make a contribution.
