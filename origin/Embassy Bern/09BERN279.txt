SUBJECT: BENIN: POLICE INTERCEPTS 11 ALLEGED TRAFFICKING VICTIMS IN \
TRANSIT TO NIGERIA \
 \
¶1. SUMMARY: On June 20, 2009, Beninese Security Forces intercepted \
a vehicle in Cotonou transporting eleven children from the \
Togo-Benin border to be allegedly trafficked to Lagos, Nigeria. On \
June 22, 2009, the Minors' Protection Brigade (BPM) interviewed the \
alleged traffickers and the victims and referred them to the Court \
of Cotonou for further legal action. END SUMMARY. \
 \
¶2. On June 20, 2009, officers of the Dantopka's Police Station, in \
Cotonou, intercepted a car transporting eleven Togolese children who \
had entered Benin at Hillacondji, the Benin-Togo border station. The \
car was passing through Cotonou, en route to the Nigerian border, \
when the police stopped it. The police handed over the eleven \
allegedly trafficked children, the suspected trafficker (a Togolese \
woman), and the driver to the BPM. \
 \
¶3. On June 22, 2009, the BPM interviewed the two suspects and the \
eleven children. The Head of the BPM, Commissioner Louis Tokpanou, \
told Post that the woman claimed she was accompanying the children \
to Lagos where they would spend holidays with their respective \
relatives, a piece of information confirmed by the children. She \
said that she was acquainted with only eight of the children, but a \
friend asked her to take the three other children to Lagos as well. \
Tokpanou said that some of the rescued children had ID cards, which \
made identification easier. Following the interception of the \
alleged victims, individuals of Nigerian nationality rushed in to \
the BMP and claimed that they were the children's relatives living \
in Lagos. \
 \
¶4. After the interview phase, the BPM referred the children, the \
persons claiming to be the children's relatives, the Togolese woman, \
and the driver to the prosecutor at Cotonou's Court for further \
action. It then sent the alleged victims to the Cotonou based Swiss \
NGO Terre des Hommes shelter, for care. Tokpanou says he can not \
assert that the case constitutes a child-trafficking without further \
investigation by the prosecutor. \
 \
¶5. Commissioner Topkanou briefed the press on the case. Initial \
media reaction suggested that the suspected woman was a known \
child-trafficker. \
