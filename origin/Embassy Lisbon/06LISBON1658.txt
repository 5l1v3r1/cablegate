Pol/Econ Officer met MFA Director of Asia Affairs Jorge 
Fonseca on August 7 to discuss U.S. concerns regarding 
Finland's invitation for the Burmese FM to attend ASEM.

policy of constructive engagement with Burma and underscored 
that the EU always includes a discussion of Burma's human 
rights problems at meetings where a Burmese cabinet-level 
representative is present.
