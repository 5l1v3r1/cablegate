SUBJECT: PORTUGAL AND THE LIBERIA PARTNERS' FORUM 
 
REF: SECSTATE 201818 
 
In response to the Embassy's encouragement to participate in 
the February Liberia Partner's Forum (reftel), Portuguese MFA 
Director of Sub-Saharan African Affairs Nuno Bello approached 
the Portuguese Institute for Development Assistance (IPAD) 
about the possibility of sending a representative, but is 
unable to confirm anything yet.  Portugal has contributed to 
the UN observer Program in Liberia, and supported the EU 
"ECHO Program" but has no ongoing bilateral programs. 
 
Comment: Due to Portugal's lack of bilateral engagement with 
Liberia, it is likely that they will send a Portuguese 
Embassy official to participate rather than a participant 
from Lisbon.  End comment.
