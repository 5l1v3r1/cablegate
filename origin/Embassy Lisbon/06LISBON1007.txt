SUBJECT: PORTUGUESE STATEMENT WELCOMES NEW U.S. IRAN POLICY 
 
REF: LISBON 1001 
 
Â¶1.  As promised in a May 31 conversation with the Ambassador 
(reftel), Foreign Minister Diogo Freitas do Amaral issued a 
statement on June 1 strongly endorsing the new U.S. policy on 
Iran.  The Embassy's translation of the statement follows: 
 
The Portuguese Government approves and welcomes the U.S. 
decision to participate, together with Britain, Germany, and 
France, in direct talks with Iran, in an attempt to solve the 
problems caused by the Iranian nuclear program, as soon as 
Iran suspends its uranium enrichment activities. 
 
As stipulated in the UN Charter, our Government has always 
advocated, first and foremost, a negotiated solution to the 
crisis. 
 
With the U.S. working alongside the EU and other major 
countries, the probability of success and maintenance of 
peace is greater and gives us more hope. 
 
Portugal appeals to the Islamic Republic of Iran to agree to 
negotiate and not to retreat into a proudly isolationist 
policy.  Tehran must offer valid and credible guarantees to 
the international community that its nuclear program has 
solely peaceful goals and does not hide any latent intentions 
of a military nature. 
 
The Spokesperson for the Minister of Foreign Affairs recalls 
that the idea of direct U.S. participation in talks with Iran 
was explicitly advocated by Foreign Minister Freitas do 
Amaral, in Parliament, during the plenary debate on May 3.
