REF: SECSTATE 136196 
 
Pol/Econ officer met with MFA Middle East Affairs Officer 
Lilia Navais to urge Portugal to encourage respect for UN 
Security Council Resolution 1701.  Navais replied that 
Portugal fully supports the resolution and wants to see the 
Middle East stabilize as quickly as possible.  While she 
noted that Portugal does not itself play a big role in 
selling arms, she said it would attempt to control weapons 
distribution through international fora such as the Missile 
Technology Control Regime (MTCR).
