¶4.  TRAVEL TIPS: Taxis are relatively inexpensive.  Be sure 
to ask for a receipt (factura).  A "taxi voucher" service is 
available at the Lisbon airport to arriving passengers. 
Vouchers are on sale at the Turismo de Lisboa counter located 
in the terminal.  The cost of the voucher depends on the 
distance of the trip and/or length of time, as well as the 
type of service required.  Fares should not be more than 
Euros 15.00 from the airport to major hotels in the city. 
 
¶5.  It is possible to use most ATM cards in Multibanco teller 
machines located throughout Portugal.  Although Multibanco 
does not assess a service charge for this transaction, normal 
service charges assessed by your own bank will apply.  USD 
1.00 equals approximately Euro 0.82. The ATM machine will 
automatically do the exchange. 
 
¶6.  THREAT ASSESSMENT:  In light of the current worldwide 
security situation, all Americans are reminded that it is 
more important than ever to maintain a high level of 
vigilance and to take appropriate steps to increase their 
security awareness.  Be sure to vary your times and routes 
and avoid patterns in your activities.  There are no known 
specific and credible threats to include violent 
demonstrations, terrorist or criminal acts that would affect 
your visit.  Personnel under the Chief of Mission's authority 
will be notified of any security advisories issued during the 
visit.  While in Portugal, if you notice any suspicious 
activity or have any security concerns the Embassy's Regional 
Security Officer (RSO) should be notified as soon as 
possible.  The RSO holds a weekly briefing every Thursday at 
9:00.  It is your responsibility to contact the Regional 
Security Office to sign-up. 
 
¶7.  Portugal has a relatively low amount of street crime. 
Violent criminal confrontations and the use of weapons are 
rare.  Burglars and pickpockets are active and visitors are 
encouraged to safeguard valuables and not carry large amounts 
of cash or unneeded credit cards.  Visitors should also be 
very careful on crowded streets, in entertainment areas, 
department stores, restaurants or crowded public 
transportation.  Car crime, such as auto thefts and thefts 
from vehicles is low.  Travelers are warned not to leave 
valuables in hotel rooms.  Eastern European organized crime 
groups are active in Portugal, but mainly target the 
immigrant populations.  The police and other emergency 
services in Portugal are adequate.  Threat information 
through the Consular Information Program is available on the 
Internet at http://travel.state.gov.  In addition to 
information on the Internet, U.S. travelers may hear recorded 
information by calling the Department of State in Washington, 
DC at (202) 647-5225 from their touchtone telephone, or 
receive information by automated telefax by dialing (202)
