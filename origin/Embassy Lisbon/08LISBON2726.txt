REF: SECSTATE 123081 
 
Pol-Econ officer delivered reftel message to Portuguese MFA 
Deputy Director for International Affairs Sara Martins and 
urged Portugal to oppose UNGA resolutions with an anti-Israel 
bias.  Since Portugal's positions on UN issues are closely 
coordinated with other EU member states, the GOP will 
probably follow EU consensus on whether to oppose or abstain 
on future votes on anti-Israel measures.  Martins did not 
provide further substantive comments.
