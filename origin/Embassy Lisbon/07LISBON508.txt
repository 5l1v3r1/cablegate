SUBJECT: PORTUGAL REVIEWS 2007 CONTRIBUTION TO UN MIDDLE 
RING SECURITY IN IRAQ 
 
REF: SECSTATE 17022 
 
¶1. (U) In response to reftel message, MFA International 
Organizations Officer Ana Paula Molina told us she had been 
unaware that funding was running low for the Middle Ring 
Security Initiative.  Molina consulted with her colleagues in 
Portugal's mission to the UN and said they were undergoing a 
review to decide whether Portugal would be able to make a 
second contribution to the fund in 2007.  Pol-Econ Officer 
stressed that the Middle Security Ring was critical to 
stabilizing the area and was quickly running out of funds. 
Molina acknowledged the importance of the mission but 
cautioned us that Portugal's austere budget would make 
additional spending difficult this year. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Portugal has been quite supportive on Iraq 
but is also facing pressure to make significant cuts to 
government spending.  It is unlikely that Portugal will be 
able to fund this initiative in 2007. End comment.
