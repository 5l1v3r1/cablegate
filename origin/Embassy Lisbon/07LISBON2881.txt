¶1. (SBU) Portuguese interlocutors told us that they are also 
concerned with the Government of Russia's response to the 
OSCE regarding election monitoring for the December 2 Duma 
elections.  They said that they are engaged with the OSCE's 
Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) 
on the issue but have not developed a public response. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  At the EU-Russia Summit (Ref B), 
Portuguese Prime Minister Socrates lauded Putin's promise to 
accept OSCE election observers, noting that the action, 
"builds trust."  We believe the Portuguese are somewhat 
embarrassed by the latest limitations, given that they had 
already accepted the Russians' earlier stalling tactics as 
understandable politics.
