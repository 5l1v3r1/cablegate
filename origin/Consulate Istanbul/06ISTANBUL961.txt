SUBJECT: LAVROV VISIT HIGHLIGHTS RUSSIA'S 2006 BSEC AGENDA 
 
Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. 
This message was coordinated with Embassy Ankara. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov 
outlined Russia's priorities for Black Sea economic 
cooperation for its six-month period as "Chairman in Office" 
in a brief address to representatives and observers to BSEC 
at the organization's Istanbul secretariat on Thursday, June 
¶1.  He called for deeper cooperation to ensure that the 
organization has a more "practical orientation' and produces 
results that are "more visible" to the public in BSEC 
countries.  Directing a portion of his remarks directly to 
observer states, he also stressed Russia's openness to 
cooperation with countries beyond the region, arguing that 
their "intellectual and and administrative resources" can 
significantly enrich BSEC's activities.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Lavrov's BSEC program immediately preceded his 
departure from Turkey.  In a brief 15-minute address, he 
noted the organization's success in encouraging cooperation 
on issues ranging from combating organized crime and 
terrorism to protection against infectious diseases.  He 
expressed support for recent initiatives to ensure BSEC 
activities have increased practical effect, pointing 
specifically to implementation of joint investment 
initiatives, large-scale infrastructure, transport, 
environmental and other projects.  Among the specific ideas 
he mentioned were the coordinated development of highways 
around the Black Sea to facilitate transportation, resumption 
of regular passenger service among Black Sea ports under 
BSEC's aegis, and the Black Sea Electric Power Ring Project, 
which Russia initiated.  By the end of 2006, he predicted, 
there should be "clarity" regarding synchronization of power 
grids in Europe, the CIS countries, and the Baltic region. 
 
¶3. (U)  Lavrov emphasized the ambitious nature of Russia's 
program for its six-month chairmanship in office, with over 
60 events, including Ministerial meetings, international 
conferences, working groups, seminars, roundtables and 
exhibitions.  The calendar will kick off early next week with 
a meeting of Ministers of Emergency Situations from June 6-7 
in Sochi.  In outlining this program, Lavro invited Member 
States and observers to participate in the full range of 
organization activities.  Addressing himself directly to the 
latter, he predicted that the importance of BSEC as a "key 
cooperation organization" will rise in the future, and 
stressed that it is open to "any kind of cooperation with the 
countries beyond the region."  He suggested that the 
intellectual and administrative resources of observer 
countries "can significantly enrich" BSEC's activities, 
helping it diversify and more efficiently address its 
practical challenges. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Lavrov also directed a few pointed messages to the 
Secretariat and its new chairman, Ambassador Leonidas 
 
SIPDIS 
Chrysanthopoulos of Greece.  He argued that to date 
cooperation between BSEC and its affiliated bodies (the 
Parliamentary Assembly, the Black Sea Trade and Development 
Bank, the BSEC Business Council, and the International Center 
for Black Sea Studies) has been "underexploited."  He 
suggested that certain changes in BSEC administration may be 
necessary to deepen this cooperation, though he was careful 
to stress that no revision of organization statutes would be 
required.  He argued an increase in the organization's budget 
would be appropriate, however, together with engagement of 
additional staff.  Most notably, he urged Chrysanthopoulos to 
"increase his control" over staff performance in implementing 
BSEC council decisions and proposals, arguing that their 
approach "should not only be responsible and dutiful," but 
also creative and marked by initiative. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The June 1 meeting was an added indication 
of renewed Russian activism in BSEC and its desire to take 
full advantage of its Chairmanship-in-Office, which runs from 
May to November 2006.  The full program of BSEC events over 
the next six months, together with further elaboration of 
Russia's priorities, is available on the BSEC web site:
