¶1.  An increasingly popular venue for international 
congresses and conventions, Istanbul will host the World 
Chambers Federation (WCF) Fifth World Chambers Congress in 
Istanbul on July 4-6.  Istanbul competed with Monaco and 
Bratislava to host the event.  Prime Minister Erdogan will 
open the event, which will feature prominent speakers 
including former Secretary of State Albright, 2006 Nobel 
laureate and Grameen Bank Chairman Muhammad Yunus and 
Coca-Cola President and COO Muhtar Kent.  Delegations will 
pay visits to business establishments in Gebze and Istanbul, 
and conference organizers are arranging a comprehensive 
schedule of one-on-one meetings for participating companies. 
 
¶2.  Over 1,000 businessmen are expected to attend the 
congress, which will be sponsored by the Turkish Union of 
Chambers and Commodities Exchanges (TOBB).  According to TOBB 
President Rifat Hisarciklioglu the congress will host the 
presidents of 1,500 chambers and commodities exchanges from 
140 countries, as well as Turkish business leaders.  Noting 
that a strong presence in international events has an 
enormous impact on business life, Hisarciklioglu said the 
congress would be a meeting point for Turkish business and 
the leading names in the world economy.  Arguing the meeting 
will contribute to the rapid implementation of cooperative 
projects, Hisarciklioglu added:  "The Fifth World Chambers 
Congress offers the participants a unique opportunity to make 
new contacts and exchange experiences and ideas.  It will be 
a significant event with its rich program, broad cooperation 
and information exchange."

covering the latest developments in the business world, 
propose solutions for current problems and predict challenges 
for the businessman of the future.  Session will address 
topics including the management of global risk, economic 
restructuring, governance in global economies, 
migration/immigration, energy security and threats to 
multilateral trade.  Conference speakers will include: 
International Finance Corporation Vice President and CEO Lars
