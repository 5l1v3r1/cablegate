 ¶1.  Istanbul Consul General (CG) met recently with Akkan 
Suver, President of the Marmara Foundation which organizes 
the annual Eurasia Economic Summit in Istanbul. Suver invited 
the CG to attend this year's summit, which is scheduled for 
May 5-6, and asked if the U.S. government would be willing to 
send a high-level official to speak at this year's summit. 
Suver said that he was certain that Minister of Foreign Trade 
Caglayan, who is one of the Turkish Co-chairs of the 
Framework for Strategic Economic and Commercial Cooperation 
(FSECC), would be happy to extend an invitation to anyone 
Washington recommended. 
 
¶2.  The event will be the 13th summit organized by the 
Marmara Foundation, whose aim is to explore ways of enhancing 
relations between the European Union, countries of Central 
Asia, the Caucasus, and the Middle East.  According to Suver, 
the main themes of the upcoming summit will be energy, 
economy, and intercultural dialogue, environment and 
education. Last year's summit was attended by 110 high-level 
dignitaries from 41 different countries including the 
Presidents of Croatia and Kosovo.  Former presidents, 
vice-premiers, ministers, deputies, representatives of 
national, regional and international organizations and from 
the world business community also attended.  Turkish 
officials included the Speaker of the Grand National Assembly 
and Ministers of Energy and Natural Resources, and Culture 
and Tourism.  Information on last year's summit is available 
at www.maramargrubu.org/detailedprogram.pdf.  Post has 
pouched materials on last year's event to EUR/SE. 
 
¶3.  ACTION REQUEST: Please advise of Washington agencies' 
interest in this year's summit, and how we should respond to 
the Marmara Foundation.
