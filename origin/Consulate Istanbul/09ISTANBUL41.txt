¶1. (SBU) Summary.  During a January 22 courtesy call by 
Ambassador Jeffrey, acting Armenian patriarch Archbishop 
Atesyan emphasized that the Armenian Turkish community is 
encouraged by the warming of relations between the Government 
of Armenia and the Government of Turkey (GOT).  Atesyan noted 
that the most challenging issue facing the Armenian community 
is the return of foundation properties confiscated by the GOT 
over the past 90 years and expressed hope for the return of 
over 250 properties after August this year. He remained 
hopeful that Turkey will join the EU, allowing for what he 
perceives as a greater recognition of his community's rights. 
End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Jeffrey conveyed his regards for the 
ailing Patriarch Mesrob II to acting Armenian patriarch, 
Archbishop Atesyan.  Atesyan explained that the Patriarch 
still lives in the Patriarchate and is taken outdoors for 
several hours each day. (Ref). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Atesyan described the Patriarchate's relationship 
with the AKP as close, explaining that because they are a 
religious party they understand one another. The Grand Muftu 
of Istanbul often visits the Patriarchate, Atesyan noted, and 
the GOT continues to listen to the concerns of the 
Patriarchate and work actively to solve problems. The most 
significant problem the Patriarchate faces is the return of 
properties confiscated by the GOT over the past 90 years, he 
said, and they have petitioned for the return of more than 
300 properties. Of this number, the GOT has returned 50, and 
Atesyan said the Armenian community foundations have until 
August to submit the full list of requested properties (to 
the General Directorate of Foundations). He contended that 
the foundations will petition the European Court of Human 
Rights if the GOT fails to return the properties in August. 
Atesyan emphasized the importance of income-earning property 
for the maintenance of Armenian schools and hospitals, 
pointing out that until 1970 the Turkish Armenian community 
operated 30 schools. Of these, the community had to close 16 
due to the impact of property confiscation on its income 
earning capabilities and because some Armenian families chose 
to send their children to other schools. The remaining 14 
schools instruct 3,500 students he said. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Archbishop Atesyan expressed hope that Turkey will 
soon become a member of the European Union. "At that time we 
will be free and be able to get all of our rights." 
Responding to the Ambassador's comment about U.S. and 
European Union efforts to encourage the GOT to further amend 
Turkish Penal Code Article 301, Atesyan lamented, "Even if 
they change Article 301, their mentality has not been 
changed."  However, he acknowledged the Ambassador's positive 
comments on President Gul's trip to Armenia for a soccer 
match, and said the Armenian Turkish population is encouraged 
by the warming of relations between the Government of Armenia 
and the Government of Turkey.  Atesyan noted that the 
Armenian Diaspora is not in favor of these developments, and 
stressed that the Armenian Turkish community has a different 
attitude toward April 24 and is ready to move beyond "the bad 
events of 1915."
