SUBJECT: ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH TO TRAVEL TO THE U.S. 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Incoming and outgoing DPOs made an 
introductory call on the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I 
on August 4 to discuss developments with Halki and the 
Patriarch's upcoming travel to the United States. End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The Patriarch shared that he would be in the 
United States between October 20 and November 5, attending 
the Eighth Symposium of Religion, Science, and the 
Environment scheduled in New Orleans October 18 - 25. His All 
Holiness is scheduled to address attendees at the official 
opening October 21 after visiting Memphis. He is also 
scheduled to travel to New York, Atlanta, and Washington, 
D.C. He reported that "his people in America" had arranged 
for a lunch for him with Secretary Clinton and a meeting with 
POTUS and VP while he is in Washington November 2 - 5. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Patriarch said he had learned that Minister for 
European Affairs Egemen Bagis wanted to meet with him. He was 
waiting to hear which of three dates he proposed would be 
accepted by Bagis.  When asked through which means the 
Patriarchate communicated with the GOT, the Patriarch 
responded that the director of the Patriarchate's press 
office (a German citizen) was working through the German 
Ambassador. According to the Patriarch, the German Ambassador 
told the press officer that Bagis responded favorably to the 
Ambassador's suggestion of meeting with the Patriarch and 
asked for the Ambassador's help in arranging a meeting. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Several months ago, the Patriarch and Bagis 
had dinner at the Patriarch's residence in Tarabya, Istanbul. 
As far as we know, the German Ambassador's involvement is new 
and may prove helpful. Although it is not clear to what 
extent Bagis's purported interest in a meeting may signal 
genuine GOT interest in working toward a solution amenable to 
the Patriarchate, it does at least represent a much needed 
link between the two parties. End Comment.
