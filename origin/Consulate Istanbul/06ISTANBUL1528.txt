SUBJECT: ISTANBUL PROTESTANT CHURCH GRANTED OFFICIAL STATUS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: The Istanbul Protestant Church Foundation 
has acquired official status for its church as a "place of 
worship" after a legal process lasting more than two years. 
This is the first time that such an application has been 
approved by the Government of Turkey (GOT) following the 
changes to laws made in 2003 within the framework of EU 
harmonization reforms.  Despite the potential precedent set, 
it is unclear whether other minority groups will have the 
desire or fortitude to pursue official status with the GOT in 
the same manner.  End Summary.

Better Late Than Never

¶2.  (U) The main pastor of the Istanbul Protestant Church 
Foundation, Carlos Madrigal, informed us that the Foundation 
received final approval from the Governor's Office to 
register its property as a "place of worship" on August 18, 
¶2006.  The church first applied to the municipality in 
February 2004 in order to change the zoning plan for the 
church property from "residential and commercial use" to 
"place of worship" in line with new zoning regulations 
promulgated in 2003.  Following a favorable response from the 
Greater Municipality in October 2005, the church had been 
waiting for final approval from the Governor's office. 
 
¶3.  (U) Although it was a long and tiresome process, Madrigal 
said the church was very pleased with the result.  "Some 
officials did not know what to do with our application, and 
they kept asking their supervisors as they did not want to 
take responsibility.  It is quite normal that it took so 
long," he said.  He added that the authorities kept church 
officials informed throughout the lengthy bureaucratic 
process.  He thinks the result is very promising and is a 
clear sign that reforms are being implemented. 
 
¶4.  (U) The Istanbul Protestant Church Foundation is the 
first religious group not covered by the GOT's interpretation 
of the Lausanne Treaty (ie: Jewish, Greek Orthodox and 
Armenian Orthodox communities) to be registered as a 
foundation.  Madrigal ascribes the zoning approval to the 
official status of the foundation, which made the application 
possible.  He believes the result is symbolically important 
although he notes the decision will not have a major impact 
on the Foundation's routine activities.  Madrigal told us, 
"We do not have a problem with services anyway, but we will 
feel much safer" now that the property is documented as a 
place of worship.

A Precedent but Will Others be Willing to Follow?

¶5.  (SBU) Comment: The approval for the official registration 
of the church is a sign of progress on the religious freedom 
front.  This could set a precedent for similar applications 
by other religious groups assuming they are willing to go 
through the lengthy, and at times, excruciating, bureaucratic 
procedure.  Turkey's (official and unofficial) religious 
minority communities however, have not always seen eye to eye 
on how to go about resolving disagreements with the GOT.  End 
comment.
