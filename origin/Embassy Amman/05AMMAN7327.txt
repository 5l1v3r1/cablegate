Seeking Help in Locating Funds 
 
Ref: Amman 7084 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Jordan's Ministry of Industry and Trade 
(MOIT) says the United States and Israel can "count on" MOIT 
to provide "100% support" for the Trilateral Industrial 
Research and Development Fund (TRIDE).  In MOIT's view, the 
next step is for TRIDE management to ask the MOIT in writing 
to make Jordan's $330,000 contribution.  End summary. 
 
TRIDE Now Assigned to Trade Ministry 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (U)  The Cabinet motion to transfer responsibility for 
TRIDE from the Ministry of Planning (MOP) to MOIT (see ref) 
was approved by the Cabinet on August 30.  On September 6, 
Ministry of Planning Americas Division Chief Ghaith Zureikat 
faxed to the Embassy a copy of the Prime Minister's letter 
to the Ministry of Planning announcing the decision. 
 
Trade Ministry Looking Elsewhere for Funds 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MOIT Secretary General Montaser Oklah discussed 
next steps on Jordanian engagement in TRIDE with Emboffs on 
September 11.  Oklah's biggest concern was finding the money 
to make Jordan's $330,000 contribution, indicating that MOIT 
"doesn't have a penny" to make such a contribution.  EMBoffs 
told him that the Ministry of Planning's former Secretary 
General Tayseer Al-Smadi had said explicitly that the MOP 
has the money set aside.  In an indication of shifting 
priorities within the GoJ, Oklah said he was surprised that 
the MOP no longer seemed interested in TRIDE; in the past, 
MOP fought within the GoJ to control projects like TRIDE. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Oklah noted that Bilal Hmoud, Director of the 
Ministry's Industrial Development Directorate, would take a 
leading role in the GoJ's participation in TRIDE.  He also 
said he wants to get all the necessary documents, work 
plans, procedures and contacts to bring MOIT up to speed 
about TRIDE and rebuild its "institutional memory."  He said 
MOIT is now "at a disadvantage" on TRIDE, and that he wants 
MOIT to be able to give "crisp, clear" answers on TRIDE 
questions.  EMBoffs assured him that the U.S. and Israeli 
TRIDE participants were prepared to provide that information 
and to meet with MOIT officials to establish ground rules, 
goals and procedures so that all the partners were 
comfortable. 
 
Trade Ministry Wants Request for Contribution from Outside 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) S/G Oklah requested that a letter be sent to MOIT 
from an as-yet-unspecified TRIDE partner outside the GoJ to 
request that Jordan's contribution to TRIDE be transferred 
as quickly as possible.  Oklah's plan is to put a MOIT cover 
letter on this incoming request and forward the two 
documents to the Ministry of Planning, asking the Ministry 
of Planning to execute the transfer. 
 
MOIT Strongly Supports TRIDE 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) S/G Oklah expressed strong support for TRIDE, 
saying that TRIDE partners can "count on" the MOIT for "100% 
support," and that his ministry "believes" in TRIDE.  He 
said MOIT is "happy to cooperate," and put himself forward 
as the MOIT's point-of-contact for TRIDE. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Comment: We think Jordan will meet its promised 
contribution, perhaps with some delay.  A larger issue is 
whether those who control budgets at the Ministry of 
Planning will support TRIDE with future infusions of money, 
or whether this settlement is the end of the line.  The 
Ministry of Industry and Trade is unlikely to have any 
financial resources to bring to the TRIDE table.
