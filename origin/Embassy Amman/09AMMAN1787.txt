SUBJECT: JORDAN EXTENDS HOURS OF ISRAEL AND WEST BANK CROSSINGS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Recent press reports touting round-the-clock opening of the 
main West Bank crossing to Jordan for the benefit of Palestinian 
commerce are exaggerated.  According to Post contacts, Israel made 
the announcement without full coordination with the GOJ.  Jordan has 
nevertheless taken action and Post has confirmed that the opening 
hours of the Jordanian terminal at the crossing between the West 
Bank and Jordan through the King Hussein (Allenby) Bridge have been 
extended, for what may be a trial period only, by four hours on 
weekdays, i.e. Sunday through Thursday.  The opening times of the 
other two border crossings with Israel, Sheikh Hussein in the north 
and Wadi Araba near Aqaba, remain unchanged. 
 
¶2. (U) Representatives from each of Jordan's three border crossing 
terminals with Israel or the West Bank told Embassy staff that their 
hours of operations are as follows: 
 
 
King Hussein (Allenby) Bridge 
Sunday - Thursday 
  0800 - 2400 for both passengers and cargo 
Friday - Saturday 
  0800 - 1200 for passengers 
  0800 - 1500 for diplomats 
  No cargo 
 
 
Sheikh Hussein Bridge (in the north) 
Sunday - Thursday 
  0630 - 2100 for passengers 
  0800 - 1830 for cargo 
Friday - Saturday 
  0800 - 2000 for passengers 
  No cargo 
 
 
Wadi Araba Crossing (between Aqaba and Eilat) 
Sunday - Thursday 
  0630 - 2000 for passengers 
  No cargo 
Friday - Saturday 
  0800 - 2000 for passengers 
  No cargo 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  The public announcements of new border crossing 
times at King Hussein Bridge were not closely coordinated with the 
GOJ.  It is also too early to judge whether the new times will 
address the delays caused by the bureaucracy at the border which can 
take several hours on the Israeli side.  End comment.
