¶1. (SBU) As requested reftel, Embassy Amman provides the 
following information on H. Mahmood J. Al-Bunnia & Sons Co. 
(HMBS): 
 
HMBS is active in Jordan and throughout the region.  Mustafa 
Bunnia, who we understand will be running the frozen food 
operation being considered by OPIC, is based in Jordan. 
 
HMBS is one of the largest private companies in Iraq. Haj 
Mahmood Al-Bunnia established the company in 1910.  Today, 
HMBS employs more than 6500 employees working in 29 
different companies.  The main office of the company is in 
Baghdad with two regional offices, one in Jordan, which is 
the operating office for the group now, and the other in 
Dubai, U.A.E.

Rockwell Automation and NewHoland Tractors. HMBS and the 
Turkish company EFES recently signed an exclusive agreement 
with Coca Cola to manufacture and distribute inside Iraq.

¶2. (SBU) Embassy has received no derogatory financial 
information on H. Mahmood J. Al-Bunnia & Sons Co.  (COMMENT: 
The Bunnia family has a reputation for bringing their own 
people from outside to service contracts in Iraqi 
localities, rather than employing local subcontractors.  An 
American business source in Jordan told us that he canceled 
an Iraq-based contract with the Bunnias due to what he 
termed was "local resentment" of the Bunnia's business 
practices.  To the extent possible, it would be helpful if 
financing mechanisms could require that Middle East Frozen 
Foods show use of local subcontractors and a local 
development component in Iraq.  END COMMENT.)
