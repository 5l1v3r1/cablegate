SUBJECT: JORDAN RELEASES GROUNDED IRAQI AIRWAYS PLANES 
 
 
¶1. (U) Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) Suleiman 
Obeidat confirmed to emboff 11/28 a recent AP report that the 
Government of Jordan (GoJ) has authorized the release of six 
Iraqi Airways planes grounded in Amman after Iraq's 1990 
invasion of Kuwait.  Obeidat added that Iraqi technicians 
would be arriving in Amman within a month to attempt to fix 
two of the six planes (Boeing 727s) and fly them back to 
Baghdad.  According to Obeidat, the other four planes "are 
not flyable or repairable."  When asked what would happen to 
those four planes, Obeidat said it was "up to the Iraqis' to 
determine how to transport the aircraft," but noted that "the 
four planes are definitely being removed from the ramp to a 
natural surface immediately." 
 
¶2. (U) When asked if the GoJ was requiring a payment for 
storage fees (understood to be approximately $5.5 million) to 
release the planes, Obeidat was clear that while the GoJ 
Ministry of Finance had approved the release without payment, 
the fees were still due in theory. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT:  The GoJ,s authorization to release the 
aircraft is in response to a request made by the GoI, and is 
a sign of Jordan,s interest in further improving relations 
with its eastern neighbor.  One possible reason for the 
decision to release the planes at this time may be the need 
for additional space to support new slots at Queen Alia 
International Airport in Amman for both an emerging domestic 
carrier, and for routes that Royal Jordanian is not using and 
plans to sell to international carriers.
