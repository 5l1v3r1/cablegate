¶1.  (SBU) The Government of Jordan, represented by the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade (MOIT), signed an agreement with the Syrian 
government on September 5 to purchase 50,000 tons of Syrian wheat. 
This purchase is part of an ambitious January 2007 agreement between 
the two countries for GOJ purchase of 500,000 tons of Syrian wheat. 
To date, however, only 250,000 tons of wheat have arrived in Jordan, 
a result of a poor growing season which forced the Syrian government 
to cancel many wheat trade commitments with numerous buyers.  This 
shipment is expected to be the last purchase of this season, and 
appears to have been driven by strong Syrian political will to 
maintain cooperative relations with Jordan. 
 
¶2.  (U) Jordan is now looking to other wheat sources and examining 
its purchase options.  One potential source is Kazakhstan, with 
which the GOJ recently signed a memorandum of understanding for 
wheat purchases.  The agreement, signed during King Abdullah's 
recent trip, accords preferential treatment to the GOJ, including 
direct purchases from producers and the ability to contract local 
and international shippers to transport the wheat to Jordan.  This 
arrangement should eliminate the middle-man and cut wheat costs for 
the JOJ by USD 50/ton.  Jordan's second option is to purchase 
American wheat under the GSM-102 program, although this credit 
guarantee program would further increase the cost of already 
expensive wheat, an expense the GOJ may be willing to bear in 
exchange for a reliable supply of high quality wheat.
