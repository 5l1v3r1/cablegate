SUBJECT: IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION THROUGH EXPORT CREDIT AGENCY 
AGREEMENTS: JORDAN 
 
REF: STATE 228304 
 
¶1.  Jordan does not have a government-operated export credit 
agency (ECA) similar to the Export-Import Bank.  The closest 
entity similar to an ECA would be the Export & Finance Bank, 
a public shareholding company based in Amman that is engaged 
in privately funded export credits.  A senior contact in the 
Jordanian Ministry of Industry and Trade did not believe that 
an EXIM bank type government ECA operation would be set up 
any time soon.  Post therefore did not take action requested 
in reftel. 
 
¶2.  Baghdad minimize considered.
