Acting PolCouns met with Walid Obeidat of the Foreign 
Minister's private office on July 5 and inquired if the GOJ 
planned to send a high-level representative to the July 9 
installation of the Government of National Unity in Khartoum. 
 Obeidat responded that while Jordan was very supportive of 
national reconciliation efforts in Sudan, it had no current 
plans to send a representative to the installation due in 
part to travel budget constraints.
