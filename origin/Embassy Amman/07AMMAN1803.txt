(SBU) Post delivered reftel invitation to Gen. Khalid 
Sarairah, the Jordan Armed Forces (JAF) Chairman of Defense, 
as well as to the Foreign Ministry's Secretary General.  The 
Foreign Ministry sent its regrets, as its lead officials on 
Iraq will be attending the expanded neighbors of Iraq 
ministerial meeting in Sharm El-Sheikh.  On April 26, the JAF 
told the Embassy that it would probably not be able to send a 
representative from Jordan, though one of its representatives 
in Tampa or Washington might attend.
