SUBJECT:  ROYAL JORDANIAN CONFIRMS SOME FLIGHT PATTERNS AVOID ISRAEL 
AT BEHEST OF ARAB COUNTRIES 
 
(SBU) A Jordanian Member of Parliament was quoted in the local press 
saying that he had observed that national carrier Royal Jordanian 
(RJ) flights to Europe and North Africa often circumvented Israeli 
airspace.  He added that RJ pilots told him that it was because 
Israel often changed the flight routes, which he viewed as an 
infringement of negotiated bilateral aviation agreements.  Iman 
Rihani, Director of Public Relations at RJ, confirmed to Emboffs 
that RJ flights from Tunisia and Libya do indeed by-pass Israeli 
airspace.  She explained that this was because Tunisian and Libyan 
officials were reluctant to file flight plans that included Israel. 
She added that when RJ flies from Jordan to those countries it does 
fly over Israel since the Jordanian government does not have similar 
concerns.
