1.(SBU)  Pol/Econ Chief spoke on November 12 with Rwandan 
Foreign Ministry International Organizations Director Ben 
Rutsinga on the three UN Third Committee no-action motions 
pending on Iran, Burma and North Korea.  As he has in the 
past, Rutysinga indicated that Rwanda often abstains on such 
motions, or does not participate, given Rwanda's "skeletal" 
staff in New York, and their inability to keep abreast of the 
full range of issues and votes at play at the UN.  He did 
agree that there was no Africa Group position on any of the 
three no-action motions, and that Rwanda's general preference 
was for human rights resolutions to be debated and voted 
upon, rather than be short-circuited by no-action motions. 
He did not indicate exactly how Rwanda would vote on any of 
the three motions, but said that efforts to engage Rwanda's 
UN Representative would be useful.
