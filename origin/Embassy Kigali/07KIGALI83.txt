SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS VETTING INFORMATION FOR SENIOR LEADER 
SEMINAR 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request, please see paragraph 2. 
 
¶2. (SBU)   Per Leahy Amendment human rights vetting 
requirements, please screen the following GOR officials 
nominated to attend the Senior Leadership Seminar (SLS) in 
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 25 Feb - 9 MAR 2007: 
-- Mr. Ben Balthazar Rutsinga, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
dob: 06 SPE 54 
-- BrigGen Mubarakh Muganga, Rwandan Defense Forces (RDF), 
dob: 26 JUN 67. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post has discovered no information concerning gross 
human rights violations derogatory information on Mr Rutsinga 
in its own files and data bases.  However, a Brussels based 
Rwandan citizen, Boniface Rutayisire, has accused Muganga of 
ordering the killings of Hutu and Tutsi civilians during the 
1994 Rwandan Civil War on his website.  Post has investigated 
his organization "Tubeho Twese Asbl" (literally- "Let Us All 
Survive") and website and has determined that the viewpoints 
expressed by Rutayisire are extreme and not credible. For 
example, a 23 January entry accuses the current government of 
an ongoing campaign to exterminate the Hutu population in 
Eastern Rwanda.  Rutayisite writes that the RDF is a 
"genocidaire army" run by "Tutsi extremists" who are 
currently committing genocide in Rwanda as they have done 
since 1994. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment. There are Rwandan opposition groups based 
in Europe and North America that are outspoken critics of 
President Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).  Many 
of these groups accuse the RPF of conducting a "Hutu 
Genocide" in 1994 after winning the Civil War-- and stopping 
the genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus-- and call for war 
crimes charges against Kagame and other RPF members. 
Rutayisire's organization appears to be on the extremist 
fringes of these vairous groups and propagates extreme 
anti-Tutsi positions and conspiracy theories. End comment. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Please contact political officer George Learned 
(Learendg@state.gov; 250.505.601 ext.3311) with any questions 
regarding this information.
