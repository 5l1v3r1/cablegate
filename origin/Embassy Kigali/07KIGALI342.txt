SUBJECT: FORMER PRESIDENT BIZIMUNGU RELEASED FROM PRISON 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary.  The Government of Rwanda released former 
President Pasteur Bizimungu from prison on April 6.  This 
release apparently occurred without prior notice to the 
public and without condition.  Coming thirteen years to the 
day from the start of the 1994 genocide, and on Good Friday, 
this release appears to be a goodwill gesture to the Rwandan 
people and the international community.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Embassy personnel on private business observed the 
release of former President Bizimungu from the central Kigali 
"1930" prison on the afternoon of Good Friday, a local 
holiday (the prison is located close to major commercial 
areas of the city).  Police drove Bizimungu, accompanied by 
his wife and his attorney, to his Kigali residence for a 
quiet reunion with friends and family members.  Bizimungu, a 
Hutu, had been in jail since his 2004 conviction on several 
counts, including embezzlement and incitement of civil 
disobedience.  The release was not announced to the public. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Reached later in the day by polchief, Bizimungu's 
attorney said that the release, which he termed a 
presidential pardon, was done "without precondition." The 
attorney had no information on the status of Bizimungu's 
codefendant, former transport minister Ntakarutinka, but 
believed him to be still in custody.  "This is a process," 
said the attorney, and "we hope Ntakarutinka will be next." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment.  Post was unable to confirm conditions of 
release or other information from government personnel. Some 
had traveled for the three-day Easter weekend, others had 
their mobile phones turned off. This low-key release of 
Bizimungu comes on the eve of the April 7 nationwide genocide 
memorial ceremonies -- April 6 marks the date in 1994 that 
unknown parties shot down the plane carrying the presidents 
of Rwanda and Burundi, and April 7 the actual start of the 
three-month genocide.  These dates are heavy with national 
remembrance and sorrow, and Bizimungu's release appears to 
represent a goodwill gesture by the Government of Rwanda to 
its people and the international community.  End Comment.
