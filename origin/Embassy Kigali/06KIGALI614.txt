REF: STATE 105245 
 
Â¶1.  On 27 June poloff delivered demarche (reftel) to Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs desk officer Daniel Mutezintare in order 
to reiterate Ambassador's earlier discussions with Foreign 
Minister Murigande on the USG position on the re-hatting of 
AMIS to a UN peacekeeping operation.  Poloff emphasized that 
the USG desired a strong and united African front supporting 
the transition to the UN and accepting partners' assistance 
in the AU.   Mutezintare promised to deliver the specific 
points to the Minister and noted that the Rwandans understood 
well the benefits of partner nation support.  (Note.  Rwanda 
is the most recent addition to the group of countries 
qualifying for ACOTA and a recent visit from Washington by an 
ACOTA planner was met with enthusiasm by the Rwandan Defense 
Force. End note.)
