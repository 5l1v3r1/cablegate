(SBU) Ambassador and AID Director met October 22 with Agriculture 
Minister Agnes Kalibata to deliver reftel letter and proposal.  The 
meeting provided an opportunity to discuss Rwanda's food security 
situation, which has been improving over the past two years but may 
face some difficulties during the current, September-to-December 
rainy season due to uneven rainfall.  Kalibata acknowledged that the 
proposal offered Rwanda an opportunity to highlight its agriculture 
progress with the U.S. and other development partners under the 
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program.  AID Director 
subsequently distributed widely the proposal to members of the 
agriculture sector development partner group, which includes 
Ministry of Agriculture, bilateral and multilateral donors, private 
sector, and civil society.
