(SBU) Pol/econ counselor delivered reftel demarche on March 
23 to Rwanda Ministry of Foreign Affairs IO Director Ben 
Rutsinga.  Rutsinga indicated Rwanda, as a member of the 
Peace and Security Council, was fully supportive of the 
declarations by the African Union (AU) on Mauritania, and in 
particular supported Mauritania's suspension from the AU and 
the use of travel and financial sanctions to press for the 
return of constitutional rule.  Rutsinga noted the AU 
preferred to use "dialogue" in attempting to reverse an 
unconstitutional usurpation of power, but that the time had 
come for sanctions "so they (the Mauritanian junta) feels 
it."  He commented that Rwanda's ambassador to the African 
Union was fully supportive of this position.
