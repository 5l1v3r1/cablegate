DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  The Ministry of Health, in conjunction with the U.S. Mission, 
launched a USD 10 million extensive anti-malaria Indoor Residential 
Spraying (IRS) campaign for Kigali on August 10.  The goal of the 
campaign is to reduce malaria-related mortality by 50 percent among 
those in most vulnerable categories (children under five years of 
age and pregnant women). 
 
¶2.  The World Bank provided USD 500,000 to implement the Business 
Plan Competition (BPC) in a bid to develop a solid entrepreneurial 
base in Rwanda.  Fifty projects will be funded this year, up from 
20last year. 
 
¶3.  The World Bank granted another USD 11 million to the Government 
of Rwanda (GOR) for a USD 69 million government road project, the 
Transport Sector Development Project.  Focused on improving the 
Kigali-Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road as well as other roads to the borders, 
the project aims to improve import into and export out of Rwanda. 
 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS 
----------------------------------- 
¶4.  On August 21 a fire broke out in the in northeastern part of 
Akagera National Park. Four park rangers were died and one remains 
in critical condition.  According to the National Tourism Board 
(ORTPN), the fire resulted from poachers attempting to distract 
anti-poaching patrol units. 
 
¶5.  The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) sent a 30-ranger 
gorilla-protection team from United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Conservation Union 
(IUCN) to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in response to the 
July slaughter of four mountain gorillas on the DR C side of the 
Virunga National Park.  The gorillas are among Africa's best tourist 
attractions and the park straddles Rwanda, DRC, and Uganda.  Virunga 
National Park was inscribed on the World Heritage Site List in 1979 
and has been on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger since 
¶1994.  A permanent gorilla-protection unit, totaling 50 rangers, is 
expected to be in place later this year, following several months of 
training.  The killings in DRC have minimal affect on Rwanda's 
gorilla population; in fact, some gorillas from the DRC have entered 
Rwanda in search of more peaceful territory. 
 
COMMERCIAL NEWS 
----------------------------- 
¶6.  The Rwanda Development Bank (BRD) will celebrate its 40 
anniversary in early September with a launch of new products on the 
market.  Some of the innovative products that BRD plans to bring to 
the market are leasing, venture capital, and guarantee funds for 
small and medium enterprises that do not have collateral to qualify 
for traditional loans.  The bank had a total loan portfolio of USD 
30 million and a net income of just over USD 1 million in 2006. 
 
¶7.  The GOR recently bought back Rwandatel, the country's original 
telecommunication company from American-owned Terracom (reftel). 
Terracom, which acquired Rwandatel for USD 20 million in 2003, 
agreed to sell the company for USD 13 million after months of 
unresolved conflicts with the GOR. Minister of Energy Albert Butare 
reports that the company has already been put on the national tender 
board and will soon be re-privatized. 
 
¶8.  The Rwanda International Trade Fair 2007 opened August 23. This 
year's theme is "enhancing trade through regional integration." 
There are 293 exhibitors, an 8 percent increase from last year. 
Foreign exhibitors came from Burundi, India, Ethiopia, Egypt, Ghana, 
Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. 
 
MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
¶9.  The Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) celebrated the 6th annual Tax 
Payer's Day by visiting different categories of taxpayers around the 
country to discusshow services can be better delivered.  Minister 
for Finance James Musoni presided over the event and said the 
country will collect USD 389 million in tax receipts this year 
compared to USD 350 million in 2006.
