SUBJECT: CHINESE DELEGATION TO ATTEND RWANDA AGRICULTURE 
MEETING DEC. 7-8 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a November 24 meeting with USAID econoff, 
Chinese Embassy economic counselor Wang Qin said a delegation 
consisting of agriculture experts and Chinese Export-Import 
Bank representatives would attend the Comprehensive Africa 
Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) conference scheduled 
for December 7-8 in Kigali.  Wan said that part of the recent 
China-Africa summit in Egypt dealt with agriculture, but that 
the Chinese government does not have plans to support 
agriculture in Rwanda as much as it does in other countries 
because Rwanda's hilly terrain makes farming very difficult. 
Chinese aid is accordingly modest, and includes rice 
demonstration plots and research, as well as assistance with 
bamboo handicraft production. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: Although President Kagame has made it clear 
he seeks closer economic ties with China as part of Rwanda's 
overall development strategy, Chinese-Rwandan cooperation on 
agriculture remains quite limited.  END COMMENT
