REF: A. DHS A/S JULIE MYERS SEPTEMBER 17 LETTER TO A/S 
        FRAZER 
     ¶B. KIGALI 0634 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Embassy has reviewed the September 17 letter from 
Department of Homeland Security ICE A/S Julie Myers to A/S 
Frazer, detailing the immigration judge's decision in regard 
to one of the three Bwindi defendants.  In her letter, A/S 
Myers requested the Department of State to offer a "preferred 
approach on effectuating removal" from the United States. 
Reftel explored at length the low risk of Government of 
Rwanda mistreatment of the Bwindi defendants, including the 
Minister of Justice, Tharcisse Karugarama's statement to the 
Ambassador that "the GOR would be willing to give appropriate 
written assurances to the USG concerning treatment of the 
defendants." 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Minister Karugarama recently renewed this offer of 
assurances.  The minister stated categorically that Rwanda 
would be willing to give written assurance, in whatever form 
required by the United States government, on proper treatment 
of the Bwindi defendants.  As we have previously stated, the 
GOR prosecution of the Bwindi defendants would not take place 
in a legal or political vacuum, but rather would occur 
against the backdrop of the GOR's ongoing campaign to secure 
the return of genocide suspects from nations around the world 
and from the ICTR. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Acutely aware of the necessity to demonstrate to 
the international community its adherence to due process 
standards, the GOR is presently engaged with Finnish and 
British authorities on extradition requests for suspected 
genocidaires found in their respective countries.  It is also 
seeking the transfer of defendants from ICTR in Arusha to 
Rwanda.  As a matter of high state policy, the GOR is 
committed to an integrated regime of acceptable detention 
facilities, proper due process protections, and appropriate 
international observation.  Rwanda stands ready to offer this 
same comprehensive system of protections to the Bwindi 
defendants.
