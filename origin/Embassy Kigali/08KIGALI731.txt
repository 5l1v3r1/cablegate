REF: KIGALI 714 
 
(SBU)   1.  The UN Pre-Deployment Visit (PDV) team concluded 
its assessment on October 10, having evaluated the four 
Rwanda Defense Force (RDF) 800-man battalions slated for 
deployment to Darfur at the Gako training base.  The PDV team 
found the four battalions to be tactically in very good 
shape, but logistically needing some further training 
assistance -- particularly in the areas of vehicle 
maintenance, radio communications, and quartermaster 
operations.  An ACOTA team at GAKO for the formal dedication 
of the ACOTA-funded peacekeeping simulation center met with 
the PDV team and Rwandan military personnel and designed a 
short training program to address these logistical deficits. 
This training will begin November 3, one week's training per 
battalion. 
 
(SBU)  2.  The PDV team and RDF officers preliminarily agreed 
upon an October 20 start date for the deployment of the four 
battalions.  The UN will fund and organize the deployment of 
troops, with equipment and support staff to follow (post 
understands discussions are underway with the UN for USG 
support for this deployment of equipment).  Vehicle operators 
and other support staff will undergo the ACOTA-funded 
logistical training while the troop deployments are underway. 
 In accordance with standard deployment operations, they will 
accompany their equipment to Darfur.
