Embassy marked the 9/11 five year anniversary with a short 
ceremony at the American Club in Kigali attended by mission 
Americans, locally engaged staff and two guests of honor. 
Ambassador Arrietti covered the key reftel themes in his 
remarks, emphasizing the US commitment to social justice, 
compassion and respect for Islam. Guests of honor were the 
Mufti of Rwanda, Sheik Saleh Habimana, and Special 
Presidential Envoy- and Ambassador to the US on 9/11- 
Ambassador Richard Sezibera.  Both reiterated the need to 
reject the ideology of hate preached by Islamic radicals and

climate of hope and opportunity.  The ceremony, covered by 
Rwandan print, radio and television media, closed with a 
moment of silence.
