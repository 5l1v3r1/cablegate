¶3. (SBU)  Post has discovered no derogatory information on 
the nominees from its own files or reputable sources. 
 
¶4. (SBU) NOTE: Post found Major Jill Rutaremara's name on a 
list of RPF members who are accused of perpetrating human 
rights abuses following the 1994 genocide.  The list appears 
in a report from SOS Rwanda-Burundi - a Belgian-based group 
linked with extremist Hutu-power movements.  The single 
sentence referring to Rutaremara states, "Un de Champions de 
la politique d'ethnilandisation (sic) du Mutara."  That is, 
he supposedly supported Tutsi repopulation strategies in 
Mutara Prefecture.  Thus, no specific accusation is made in 
this report of any human rights offense.  Further, the report 
contains many factual errors, and we do not consider it a 
credible source.  The report was published on the website for 
Inshuti - another Hutu-power group based in Barcelona, with 
links to genocide denial campaigns.  This is the only 
reference we found linking Major Jill Rutaremara to any 
supposed involvement in human rights abuses or activities 
inconsistent with the U.S. foreign policy goals. 
 
¶5.  (U) Post point of contact is pol/econ intern Emily 
Narkis.
