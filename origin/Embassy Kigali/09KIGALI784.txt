SUBJECT: WESTERN PROVINCE FOCUSES ON AGRICULTURAL REFORMS, 
SERVICE DELIVERY 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On November 17, local officials in Western 
Province said they were focused on implementing agricultural 
reforms and improving delivery of basic services. Lack of 
financing and inadequate transportation infrastructure 
remained challenges. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On November 17, Emboff met separately with the 
executive secretaries of Karongi District and Western 
Province to discuss major issues and challenges in those 
areas. Western Province is composed of seven districts 
(including Karongi District), 96 sectors, 538 cells, and 
3,612 villages. Provincial administrations have three main 
roles--to coordinate district plans, to follow-up on the 
implementation of those plans, and to mobilize resources. 
Western province, with a population of over two million 
people, produces more than 60% of the nation's coffee, is 
home to 60 percent of the nation's tea plantations, and is 
also a large producer of bananas, Irish potatoes, rice, 
maize, and wheat. This province, which borders the entire 
shore of Lake Kivu, also has the largest hydroelectric plant 
on the Rusizi River. Beyond agriculture, the Western Province 
includes tourist sites such as Kibuye and the Nyungwe Forest. 
 
¶3. (U) Karongi District is home to the Gisovu tea plantation, 
which produces internationally renowned tea and also has a 
small fish processing plant. The executive secretary, who has 
been in his position for six months, stressed that the most 
important program in the district is agricultural reform - 
both land consolidation and crop intensification. The 
district set a target of consolidating 800 hectares of land 
for maize production and has exceeded the goal by 300 
hectares. Additionally, the district has plans to consolidate 
land for banana plantations. Other programs include terracing 
and tree planting to prevent erosion, savings and loan 
schemes, promoting medical insurance and building 101 new 
classrooms by the end of the year. 
 
¶4. (U) The executive secretary of Western Province, who has 
been in his position since April, noted the need for improved 
roads. Poor roads deter investors and increase the cost of 
goods transported from elsewhere. He mentioned the 
underutilized Lake Kivu as a possibility for transportation 
and shipping by boat. As of now, the provincial governor is 
encouraging all districts, as well as the private sector, to 
contribute to the Western Province Investment Corporation. 
Collected funds will be invested in different development 
projects throughout the province. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: The activities described above--designed to 
improve agricultural productivity, improve delivery of 
services, and increase savings--fit in with Rwanda's 
long-term national development plans, and are similar if not 
identical to initiatives that the rest of Rwanda's 30 
districts are pursuing. END COMMENT.
