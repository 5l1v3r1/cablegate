(SBU)  Pol/Econ Chief delivered reftel demarche to Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs Africa Director Augustin Rutikara on 
December 22.  Rutikara signaled Rwanda's continued support 
for the firm AU approach toward the military junta in 
Mauritania, saying that "no recognition" was the proper 
approach, and that hasty elections would benefit only the 
military leaders.  Sanctions were worth considering, he said, 
as the international community sought to pressure the 
military regime.
