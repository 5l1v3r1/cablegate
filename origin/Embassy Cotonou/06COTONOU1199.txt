DELIVERED AND FOLLOWUP 
 
REF: STATE 178365 
 
¶1. (SBU) On October 26 Pol/Econ Chief delivered 
reftel talking points to Thomas Adoumasse, 
Director of the MFA's Office of International 
Organizations. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On December 7 Pol/Econ Chief asked Mr. 
Bienvenu Houngbedji of the MFA's International 
Organizations office to provide additional 
information on the current status of Benin's 
national legislation regarding criminalizing 
activities prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention. Houngbedji said that, at present, the 
Beninese Penal Code does not contain provisions 
that would permit criminalizing CWC-prohibited 
activities but that the Penal Code is currently 
under revision and that once this process is 
complete it will be possible to finalize national 
CWC legislation (which is already in final draft 
form following the December 2005 visit of an OPCW 
technical assistance team). Houngbedji speculated 
that revision of the Penal Code would be finished 
within two to three months and further volunteered 
that similar national legislation related to 
nuclear weapons would be ready following a 
national seminar planned for February. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Houngbedji conceded it might be possible 
to discuss the draft CWC legislation, too, during 
the national seminar in February, but that it was 
more likely to be discussed shortly thereafter 
during a separate national seminar. Houngbedji 
said Benin had approached the Organization for the 
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) for 
financial support for such a national seminar and 
that the GOB is currently awaiting a response to 
their request.
