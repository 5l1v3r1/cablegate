1.(SBU) Per reftel (A), Charge delivered points urging the
Government of Jamaica (GoJ)'s recognition of Kosovo during a private
meeting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade
(MFAFT)'s Under Secretary for Multilateral Affairs, Ambassador
XXXXXXXXXXXX, on July 23.

2.(SBU) Amb. XXXXXXXXXXXX indicated that she expected no change in the
GoJ's decision not to extend formal diplomatic recognition to Kosovo
(reftel D and previous).  She noted that:

-- On humanitarian grounds, the GoJ had not opposed Kosovo's
membership in the World Bank (reftel B);

-- the Dominican Republic's recent recognition of Kosovo, and
Belize's recognition some months ago, did not constitute a
groundswell of Caribbean support for recognition;

-- the GoJ always had taken the position that secession of any
territory should be a matter of mutual agreement between all parties
involved;

-- the GoJ shared the USG's hope for peace and economic development
in the Balkans.

3.(SBU)  Post will report any further developments with respect to
the GoJ's position regarding Kosovo.
