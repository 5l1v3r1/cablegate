REF: SAN JOSE 2580 
 
¶1. Embassy Kingston grants country clearance to Regional 
Environmental Specialist Andrea Borel to travel to Jamaica November 
28 to December 1, 2006, to attend a meeting on the action plan for 
the Caribbean Environment Program, as well as the White Water to 
Blue Water Council meeting in Montego Bay, Jamaica.  Embassy point 
of contact is Economic Officer John Morgan who can be reached at (w) 
876-935-6028. 
 
¶2. Embassy understands that no further assistance is requested. 
 
¶3. Visitors traveling to Jamaica for periods less than two weeks do 
not require a visa. 
 
¶4. There has been no specific threat directed against official 
American visitors or American tourists who visit Jamaica.  However, 
Jamaica has been designated a high threat country because of street 
crime.  It is recommended that caution be exercised while traveling 
in Montego Bay.  Walking after dark is not advised.  Care should be 
taken if driving at night.  Overall, the same level of awareness 
should be exercised as in a similar-sized city in the United 
States. 
 
¶5. Travelers' checks can be exchanged for Jamaican dollars at most 
tourist hotels in Montego Bay.  ATM machines are also available.
