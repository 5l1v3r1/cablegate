¶1. (U) Per reftels, on November 13 Charg???? delivered demarche to 
Government of Jamaica (GOJ)'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Foreign Trade (MFAFT) regarding upcoming UNGA human rights 
resolutions on Iran and Burma.  At that time, Charg???? received 
assurances that the GOJ's Permanent Representative (PR) would vote 
"no" on the "no action" motions, but that the MFAFT remained 
undecided on the substantive resolutions pertaining to Burma, Iran, 
and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).  However, 
subsequent reports from USUN New York indicated that the GOJ's PR 
had not been informed of MFAFT's assurances to Charg????. 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) On November 18, Charg???? spoke with Dr. Kenneth Baugh, 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, and Ambassador 
Evadne Coye, MFAFT Permanent Secretary, regarding the upcoming UNGA 
human rights resolutions.  Once again, the GOJ was solicited to 
vote "no" on "no action" motions and "yes" on substantive 
resolutions highlighting human rights abuses in these countries. 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) Minister Baugh and Ambassador Coye again confirmed that GOJ 
would vote "no" on the "no action" motions, but now indicate that 
GOJ will vote "yes" on the DPRK and Burma resolutions and "no" on 
the Iran resolution.   Baugh and Coye assured Charg???? that the 
GOJ's 
PR had been made aware of these directives, but that they were not 
willing to discuss the matters further.  Post will report any 
further developments as they arise.
