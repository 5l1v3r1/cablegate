United States Government provides protection at the Naval 
Station in Guantanamo Bay for a number of migrants who have 
been determined to be in need of protection because of a 
well-founded fear of persecution or because they would more 
likely than not face torture if returned to their country of 
origin.  The United States seeks third countries to resettle 
these migrants.
