SUBJECT: JAMAICA: DEMARCHE DELIVERED ON HAITI'S WAIVER OF TOURIST 
VISA REQUIREMENTS FOR CHINESE NATIONALS 
 
¶1. (U) Per reftel, Emboff delivered demarche expressing USG 
concerns that the Government of Haiti (GOH)'s recent removal of 
tourist visa requirements for nationals of the People's Republic of 
China (PRC) would lead to increases in alien smuggling and human 
trafficking networks and encourage intending immigrants from PRC to 
use Haiti in attempts to enter the U.S. illegally.  Demarche was 
delivered to Ms. Jennifer McDonald, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 
of the Government of Jamaica (GOJ)'s Passport, Immigration, and 
Citizenship Agency (PICA) on the afternoon of October 26.  Emboff 
also sought the GOJ's views on the GOH's action and requested that 
the GOJ assist USG in monitoring the transit of Chinese nationals 
and other suspect travelers en route to Haiti. 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) Ms. McDonald informed Emboff that the GOJ had been unaware 
of the GOH's policy change and that PICA had detected no 
identifiable changes in movements of PRC nationals through Jamaica. 
Emboff was assured that any changes in PRC travel trends would be 
shared with the U.S. Embassy.
