SUBJECT: JAMAICAN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS: THE VIEW FROM A VISA WINDOW 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Consular Section offers a unique perspective on 
economic patterns and sheds light on the individual economic 
situations of average Jamaicans.  As seen from the perspective of a 
visa window, the economic situation of most Jamaicans appears 
tenuous and inconsistent, reflected in part in the high volume of 
fraudulent documents with respect to employment situations.  Often 
applicants misrepresent their job, position, and salary to the 
interviewing officer, so it is difficult to obtain an accurate 
assessment of an applicant's job status and income level.  Although 
Jamaica lies in close proximity to the U.S. and there are frequent 
flights, the cost of a trip is often equivalent to one month's 
salary, even for Jamaicans earning higher salaries.  Post expects to 
see an increase in our refusal rate and the use of fraudulent 
documents through the international economic downturn.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
Average Monthly Salary 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  More than half of the nonimmigrant visa (NIV) applicants 
make less than USD 1,000 per month in a country in which the annual 
per capita income is near USD 3,800.  Over the past three months, 
the refusal rate for Jamaican visitor's visas was 43 percent (up 
from 37 percent for the same period last year). For many of those 
approved for a visa, the cost of a trip to the U.S. equals about one 
month's salary.  Many applicants intend to stay with family members 
who live in the United States, so there are no hotel expenses 
associated with their travel.  Flights to the U.S. are regularly 
under USD 300. 
 
Type of Work 
------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) Many of visa applicants are self-employed, usually in small 
businesses of less than five employees that are either street vendor 
operations or home-based businesses.  Common occupations for the 
self-employed include: small restaurants, bars, hair salons, dress 
making shops, and craft making stores.  It is difficult to determine 
accurately the annual income for these businesses, as many are not 
formally registered and most do not pay annual income taxes.  Thus, 
they do not have reliable revenue or tax payment records. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Many applicants are unlikely to qualify for a U.S. visa 
without previous travel and evidence of other financial resources 
because they appear to need jobs in the United States to supplement 
their incomes.  Workers in the tourism industry account for a large 
portion of the applicants interviewed; the majority of these 
applicants are housekeepers, cooks, and receptionists who make 
between USD 500 and USD 800 per month. Turnover in the sector is 
also very high.  Of those from this sector who are issued visas, 
most work in hotels and restaurants at the managerial level, often 
making USD 1,500 per month on average.  The worsening economic 
situation in Jamaica because of the global economic crisis raises 
greater concerns over those with transportable job skills seeking to 
work illegally in the United States.  COMMENT: The Jamaican Ministry 
of Labor does not survey wages and salary information, making it 
difficult to accurately assess average incomes. END COMMENT. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Jamaicans who work in the public sector have more stable 
jobs, but lower salaries.  Elementary and Secondary school teachers 
make between USD 200 to USD 700 per month, depending on the grade 
level taught and the education level of the teacher.  College and 
University educators earn between USD 1,000 and USD 2,000 per month. 
 The Jamaican military and the large bauxite and mining firms tend 
to employ people for a full career.  While average salaries in these 
jobs are still under USD 1,500 per month, employees will usually 
stay with the same organization until retirement. 
 
Fraud Trends 
------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) Fraud is most commonly found with applicants in 
entertainment groups and sports teams.  There are often additional 
applicants who apply with a larger group of performers or athletes 
who have no role in the performances or competitions. 
Misrepresentation is very common and job letters are often false or 
misleading.  In general, job letters are not reliable, as there are 
many document vendors who have turned false job related documents 
into a cottage industry. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Taking the global economic crisis into consideration, Post 
expects that the employment situation will worsen.  Rising 
unemployment and weaker individual economic situations in Jamaica 
will likely result in higher refusal rates.  Post also expect an 
increase in the use of fraudulent documents as applicants attempt to 
disguise low wages or unemployment.
