¶1. Post believes that, in Jamaica, an objective, factual Op-ed 
outlining human rights violations, detentions of political 
prisoners, and the lack of a genuine democratic process in Cuba 
would be the most effective means of expressing solidarity with the 
Cuban people on May 21. 
 
¶2. Post requests that Department provide an appropriate one-page 
Op-ed.
