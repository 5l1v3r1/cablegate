1.(SBU)  Per reftels, PolOffs raised the question of possible 
medevac alternatives for protected migrants during a private meeting 
with the Jamaican Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade 
(MFAFT)'s Director of Bilateral Relations, Mr. Courtenay Rattray, on 
September 14. 
 
2.(SBU)  Rattray said that, as long as the U.S. would pay for 
transportation, treatment, and return of the protected migrants, he 
could see no reason that the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) would 
object to their coming to Kingston.  He asked that the Embassy 
provide the MFAFT a written note or letter outlining the proposed 
understanding between the USG and GoJ.  Post requests that 
Department provide text for use in a letter, diplomatic note, or 
MOU, as appropriate.
