Classified By: CDA ISIAH L. PARNELL, Reasons 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1.(C) The prospective arrest of the major "Don" Christopher 
"Dudus" Coke, who is wanted for extradition to face narcotics 
and arms trafficking charges in New York (reftel A), could 
ignite civil unrest in West Kingston, Spanish Town, and 
Montego Bay, according to the Government of Jamaica (GoJ)'s 
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
Foreign Trade, Dr. Kenneth Baugh.  Speaking in the course of 
a private meeting on Sept. 10, in response to EmbOff's 
inquiry regarding the extradition request, Baugh reiterated 
GoJ concerns that, over the years, Coke's wealth and 
influence have become "deeply ingrained" in the Jamaican 
society and economy (reftels B-E).  Because of the severe 
economic crisis afflicting the country, at present Coke's 
pervasive power was particularly dangerous: with high 
unemployment, labor union discontent, and signs of civil 
unrest already present (reftels F-H), his arrest could "spark 
off" this volatile mix.  Nevertheless, Baugh assured EmbOff, 
the GoJ would "meet its obligations under the Extradition 
Treaty," although "due process" would have to be followed. 
(Comment:  Baugh did not offer a specific timeframe.  His 
concerns of possible civil unrest did not strike EmbOff as a 
mere pretext for GoJ delay in arresting Coke; on the 
contrary, his fears are well-founded.  End Comment.)
