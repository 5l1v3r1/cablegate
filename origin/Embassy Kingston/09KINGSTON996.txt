REF: STATE 118799 
 
Â¶1. (U) Per reftel, EmbOff delivered demarche and delivered nonpaper 
expressing U.S. concern regarding the number of UNGA resolutions 
reflecting an anti-Israel bias.  Demarche was delivered to Ms. 
Shae-Alicia Lewis and Mr. Rohan Clarke of the International 
Organizations Department of the Government of Jamaica (GOJ)'s 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade (MFAFT) on the 
morning of November 24.  In recent years, Jamaica has consistently 
voted in favor of such resolutions; Lewis advised Emboff that these 
votes are often intended to maintain collegial relations within the 
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and are not necessarily indicative of 
substantive support for the resolutions.  Post will relay any 
substantive response.
