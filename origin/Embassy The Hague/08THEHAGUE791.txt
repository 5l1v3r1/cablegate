(SBU) The Dutch are committed to completing their current 
NATO Training Mission - Iraq (NTM-I) involvement.  Pol-Mil 
Officer delivered reftel points on September 10 to the Iraq 
Policy Advisor at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  In June 
2008, the Dutch Council of Ministers extended the Dutch 
commitment to NTM-I to August 2009.  The Dutch continue to 
support a "proportional" contribution to NTM-I.  The Dutch 
have not proposed any follow-on mission.
