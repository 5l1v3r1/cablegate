The Dutch government issued a ministerial decree on May 3 
that will allow it to confiscate assets of the former Iraqi 
regime.  The GONL is still in the process of notifying Dutch 
and Iraqi banks of this decree's provisions.  Once these 
notifications are complete, the Dutch will confiscate assets 
already frozen and transfer them to the Development Fund for 
Iraq.
