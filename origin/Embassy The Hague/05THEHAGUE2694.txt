 ¶1. (SBU) On October 4, Charge raised reftel points on the 
need to counter the recent increase in violence in Sudan with 
Hugo Siblesz, Director General of Political Affairs at the 
MFA.  Siblesz agreed that the situation was worrisome, and 
that it was important for parties to weigh in with both the 
GNU and the rebels to bring it back under control.  He noted 
that the Dutch were working primarily through the EU and the 
AU, but would also look at ways to make their concerns known 
directly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 5, POLOFF followed up with Hans Docter, 
Deputy Head of the Sudan Task Force at the MFA.  Docter 
reacted with enthusiasm to the positions articulated in 
reftel points and emphasized that the Dutch share our 
concerns.  Docter added that the Dutch intend to "turn up the 
heat" on the GNU to restrain the jinjaweed. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) POLOFF asked Docter about Dutch PM Balkenende's 
recent speech at the Abuja talks.  Docter said that 
Balkenende relished the opportunity to address the 
participants and had urged continued participation in the 
Abuja talks.  Docter expected to receive a copy of the speech 
soon, and promised to pass it to POLOFF.
