Emboffs delivered reftel points to Dutch MFA contacts Alle Dorhout, 
head of West Africa and Horn of Africa Affairs, and Peter Flik, head of 
Humanitarian Aid Division.  The Netherlands supports increased 
humanitarian aid in the Horn of Africa.  Dutch Development Minister 
Bert Koenders pledged an additional five million Euros on June 27 for 
Ethiopia, considered a "Development Partner" along with Kenya.  Two 
million Euros will go directly to malnourished children through UNICEF. 
 This is on top of the 4.05 million Euros the Netherlands has already 
guaranteed for Emergency Program Funding to Ethiopia.  The Dutch also 
sent a letter to the Ethiopian government asking for unrestricted acces 
for all aid organizations.  Aid to Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somali 
is 9.7% of the 202.5 million Euros the Netherlands dedicates to 
Emergency Program Funding world wide.
