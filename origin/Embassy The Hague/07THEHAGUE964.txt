¶1.  (SBU)  On May 22, Econoff and Poloff delivered reftel 
points to Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials Adrian 
Palm, Head of the East Asia Division, and Pim van Gemeren, 
China Policy Officer, East Asia Division.  Palm said the GONL 
agreed that the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) 
was not the proper forum for discussing or resolving 
China-Taiwan policy.  The GONL supported the original EU 
Presidency position of preventing the resolution from being 
tabled, he noted, as the Chinese resolution was far beyond 
the EU's one China policy. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Van Gemeren said the German EU Presidency was in 
contact with the Director-General and President of the OIE, 
but the resolution would probably come to a vote despite EU 
and U.S. opposition.  Palm added that the EU was still 
exploring a fallback position, but that an EU consensus had 
not yet been reached.  He commented that technical fora, such 
as the OIE, were primarily composed of subject experts who 
tended not to discuss geopolitical issues such as 
China-Taiwan relations.  Palm believed the Chinese would 
continue to bring up similar resolutions in other 
international fora, as the Chinese were pressing hard lately 
on the Taiwan issue.
