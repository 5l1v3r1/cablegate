(C) Poloff delivered reftel demarche June 15 to MFA acting 
Central America desk officer Dimitri Vogelaar.  According to 
Vogelaar, the GONL is highly likely to support the OAS 
monitoring mission financially.  Discussions are also 
underway within the GONL, and with the European Commission, 
on possible observers.  Vogelaar says the GONL might well 
send one or two of its own Foreign Ministry employees to join 
a European Commission team. The personnel would most likely 
be drawn from the region, he said, rather than sent from The 
Hague.
