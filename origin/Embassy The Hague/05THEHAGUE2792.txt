 ¶1. (SBU) On October 13, POLOFF delivered reftel points to 
Carlijn Pouwels and Hagar Lightvoet (Policy Officers, Sudan 
Task Force, MFA).  POLOFF noted that the U.S. was urging the 
Presidency of the Government of National Unity (GNU) to form 
the Assessment and Evaluation Commission (EAC) and asked the 
Dutch to support this effort. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In response, Lightvoet noted that Hans Docter, 
Deputy Head of the Sudan Task Force, is currently in 
Khartoum, where he already had planned to express Dutch 
support for establishing the EAC directly to GNU FM Akol. 
Lightvoet promised to pass reftel points to Docter to help 
him prepare for his meeting, and said Docter would most 
likely be willing to provide an outbrief on his return.
