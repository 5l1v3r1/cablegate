¶1.  Summary: The GONL is interested in attending the proposed 
open-ended seminar in national capacities to discuss 
implementation of UNSCRs 1737 and 1747 during the week of 
June 4, 2007, in Vienna.  However, GONL subject matter 
experts will be engaged with the Australia Group Plenary in 
Paris that same week, and are not able to attend the Vienna 
meeting.  The GONL will attempt to pass information on export 
denials to Iran by the proposed deadline, and is comfortable 
with initially sharing such information with the IAEA 
Secretariat and the UNSCR Iran Sanctions Committee.  However, 
 
SIPDIS 
the Dutch have reservations regarding sharing this 
information with non-Nuclear Supplier Group (NSG) states. 
MFA Senior Advisor for Nuclear Affairs and Nonproliferation 
Ceta Noland discussed reftels with polmiloff on May 23.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. Noland said the GONL is very interested in attending the 
proposed open-ended seminar in national capacities to discuss 
implementation of UNSCRs 1737 and 1747.  However, the 
proposed meeting date during the week of June 4 in Vienna is 
problematic, as all Dutch subject matter experts will be tied 
up with the Australia Group Plenary in Paris that same week. 
"We just do not have the staff or experts as other, bigger 
countries, and given the short notice, will have to 
prioritize," she said.  She hoped that a member from the 
Dutch delegation in Vienna might be able to attend, but noted 
that Dutch FM Verhagen will visit Vienna on June 5, and most 
Dutch delegation members will be involved with the visit. 
She suggested other, smaller EU member states might have the 
same conflict with the Australia Group, and questioned 
whether the meeting might be pushed back to after the next 
IAEA Board of Governors meeting. 
 
¶3. Noland confirmed that the Dutch are comfortable with 
sharing confidential information pertaining to export denials 
to Iran with the IAEA Secretariat and the UNSC Iran Sanctions 
Committee, provided such information was not/not circulated 
to all IAEA member states.  She said, however, that the GONL 
does not support at present sharing such information with 
non-NSG states.  "It depends on which non-NSG states are 
included," she said -- any release would require review by 
Dutch intelligence agencies.  She was hopeful the Dutch could 
provide export denial information by the May 30 deadline as 
requested reftels.
