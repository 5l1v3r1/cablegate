¶1.  (U)  Econoff shared on October 26 reftel points 
concerning the designation of Iranian entities and 
individuals under U.S. executive orders with Wendela 
Haringhuizen, Senior Policy Officer, Terrorism and New 
Threats Unit, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), and 
Anne-Chris Visser, Senior Advisor Integrity Division, 
Ministry of Finance (MOF). 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Visser said the information provided would be 
passed to the Dutch Intelligence and Security Services (AIVD) 
and Dutch members of the Financial Action Task Force. 
Regarding the U.S. domestic designation, she noted that the 
Dutch preferred "global" sanctions, such as UN sanctions, 
followed by sanctions at the EU level.  National sanctions, 
she added, should only be used as a "last resort." 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Visser noted that the Integrity Division would 
meet October 30 with MOF's export credits experts and 
representatives from the MFA to discuss Iran sanctions and 
possible actions at the EU level.  Post will follow up and 
report on any substantive information received or actions 
taken.
