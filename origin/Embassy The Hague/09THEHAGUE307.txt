¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY/BACKGROUND: The Dutch views on Russia, Iran, 
counter piracy, EU proceedings, Bosnia and development aid 
are described in the following paragraphs.  The Dutch MFA 
reviewed its positions in a letter to parliament (ref A), and 
MFA officials Rochus Pronk and Cees Bansema briefed local 
diplomats on May 14 (views below).  Post conveyed 
Department's priorities (ref B) to Pronk, Bansema, and other 
key contacts at the MFA.  END SUMMARY/BACKGROUND. 
 
¶2. (SBU) VIEWS FROM THE DUTCH MFA STAFF: 
 
-- EU-RUSSIA SUMMIT: Preparing for the May 21-22 summit, the 
Dutch intend to encourage member states to raise points of 
disagreement with Russia, such as Georgia, human rights, and 
the Eastern Partnership, in addition to discussions where 
both sides have common interests, such as Afghanistan, 
Pakistan and the financial crisis.  The Dutch may raise the 
issue of homosexual rights, particularly if the openly gay 
Dutch Eurovision contestants, in Moscow for a competition, 
are attacked during an expected demonstration in support of 
gay rights. 
 
-- IRAN: The Dutch do not expect an EU decision next week but 
rather "a further discussion" of when to take further 
measures against Iran. 
 
-- COUNTER PIRACY: The Dutch strongly support the EU piracy 
mission but want to ensure the mission is effective and 
coordinate, resolve concerns about impunity, and consider the 
idea of a separate tribunal. 
 
-- EU: Looking ahead to the June European Council meeting, 
the Dutch expect the EU will focus on the financial crisis 
and the Lisbon Treaty.  The Dutch noted that "everyone wants 
to help Ireland" for the second treaty referendum.  The Dutch 
expect the EU to create some sort of additional text with 
further explanations of the treaty to address Irish popular 
concerns. 
 
-- BOSNIA: The Dutch are ready to support the transition from 
the Office of the High Representative to the EU Special 
Representative, but want to move "carefully," and do not want 
the transition "rushed." 
 
-- DEVELOPMENT AID: Dutch Minister for Development 
Cooperation Koenders will encourage his counterparts to 
maintain the EU's aid funding targets, notwithstanding the 
financila crisis.  Koenders will also present a paper on good 
governance and budget aid.  Koenders will discuss norms to 
promote good governance, as the EU has seen an "enormous" 
shift from aid program funding to direct budget support to 
governments.
