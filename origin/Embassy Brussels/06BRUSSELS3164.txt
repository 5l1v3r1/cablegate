SUBJECT: APPEALS HEARD IN GICM AND DHKP-C TERROR TRIALS 
 
REF: A. BRUSSELS 555 
 
     ¶B. BRUSSELS 692 
 
¶1.  (U) Five members of the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group 
(GICM), who appealed February 2006 convictions under 
Belgium's antiterrorism law, have received sentences ranging 
from forty months to eight years.  The February 2006 verdict 
by a Brussels criminal court found the GICM members guilty of 
belonging to a terrorist group linked to attacks in Madrid 
and Casablanca and providing logistical and financial support 
to the group.  The original trial of the five appellants was 
the first under Belgium's 2003 antiterrorism law.  The 
legislation provides a maximum of five years for belonging to 
a terrorist organization and a maximum of ten years for 
actively abetting terrorists. 
 
¶2.  (U)  In another appeals case, the federal prosecutor 
urged the court to impose stiffer sentences for members of 
the Turkish group DHKP-C, who, last February, also were 
convicted under the 2003 antiterrorism law for membership in 
a terror organization and for providing material support to a 
terrorist group.  Both sides are presenting final arguments 
in this case, with the verdict expected soon.  (Fehriye 
Erdal, the most celebrated defendant, escaped from Belgian 
custody around the time the original verdict was announced.) 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment: Belgian authorities cite the 2003 
antiterrorism law as an effective means to move against 
suspected terrorists before they can act and to go after 
supporters of terrorism.  In upholding the convictions of the 
five GICM appellants under the law, Belgian federal 
authorities believe a positive signal is being sent in 
support of tougher antiterrorism monitoring and enforcement 
efforts.  Federal authorities have told us they want to 
assess the ruling of the appeals courts to gauge what they 
will be able to further prosecute successfully under the 2003 
legislation.
