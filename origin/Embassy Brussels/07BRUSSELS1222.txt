¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: In conformity with its role as chair of 
the UNSC Iran sanctions committee, Belgium has pledged full 
compliance with the United Nations Security Council 
Resolutions (UNSCR) 1737 (ref D) and 1747.  Belgian financial 
institutions appear to be fully implementing relevant freeze 
obligations.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On March 27 Econoff conveyed USG concerns regarding 
full compliance with UNSCR resolutions on Iran (para 5 of ref 
C) to the following GOB officials: Beatrice Detiste, 
Financial Specialist, Treasury; Olivier Henin, Advisor, 
Ministry of Finance; and Lia Umans, Analyst at CTIF-CFI, 
Belgium's Financial Intelligence Unit. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On April 2, Econcouns contacted Henin who detailed 
the steps taken by Belgian financial institutions listed in 
para 4 of ref A to follow asset freeze obligations outlined 
in UNSCR 1747.  By way of additional background on Belgian 
commitment to Security Council resolution implementation (ref 
E), Henin explained that Belgium, like other EU countries, 
implements UN sanction resolutions through a binding but not 
directly applicable Common Position and a binding and 
directly applicable regulation.  Henin further clarified that 
a Common Position for the EU (and therefore Belgium) to 
implement UNSCR 1737 had been already drafted and would be 
amended in the coming days to include all provisions of UNSCR 
1747 (see ref B for background on EU follow through). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Henin assured Econcouns that Belgium is "keeping up 
the pressure" regarding obligations placed upon financial 
institutions.  Speaking from previous experience with the two 
Belgian financial institutions listed in ref A, Henin stated 
that he was confident both banks would fully implement 
relevant freezing obligations without delay. 
 
BELGIUM'S REPORT TO UN ON IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 1737 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
¶5.  (SBU) Meanwhile post reviewed Belgium's report to the 
1737 Security Council Committee.  Para 19 of UNSCR 1737 
mandates that all States must report to the Committee within 
60 days of the resolution's adoption in order to describe the 
progress of implementations outlined in paras 3-8, 10, 12, 
and 17 of the resolution.  Belgium's response, in a February 
16 note verbale to the Committee, states that Belgium is in 
conformity with all of the mandates in each relevant 
paragraph based upon already existing domestic legislation. 
However, Belgian implementation of the "vigilance" provision 
of paragraph 17 was to be reported separately, according to 
the note verbale. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Post will update on Belgium's status of 
implementing provisions outlined in para 17 of UNSCR 1737 
separately as appropriate.
