SUBJECT: BELGIUM TO FORGIVE 80% OF IRAQI DEBT 
 
 ¶1.  At the Stockholm Conference on Iraq, Belgian State 
Secretary for Foreign Affairs Olivier Chastel stated that 
Belgium is willing to forgive 80% of Iraq's bilateral debt by 
the end of 2008.  Belgium would forgive 260 million euros 
($403 million) out of a total debt of 323 million euros ($500 
million). 
 
¶2.  Chastel also noted that Belgium has already contributed 
14 million euros ($22 million) to Iraq's reconstruction 
through bilateral and multilateral channels. 
 
¶3.  In addition to the debt forgiveness, Belgium's assistance 
to Iraq in 2008 will be provided under the framework of a 
Benelux partnership providing a training program in 
investigation techniques.  Belgian federal police and Belgian 
Ministry of Justice officials will participate in this 
program.
