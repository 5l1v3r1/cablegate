SUBJECT: BELGIUM: SUPPORT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSCR 1816 
(2008) ON SOMALI PIRACY 
 
REF: SECSTATE 74305 
 
¶1. (U) Belgian MFA officials told econoff Belgium supports 
efforts to protect shipping from piracy off the Somali coast. 
 The officials consider UNSCR 1816 a good resolution and hope 
useful action results in the next six months and/or the time 
period will be extended.  They noted that France and Spain 
just made a joint demarche asking for Belgium's support 
toward a united EU effort to stop the piracy.  Officials 
appreciate the U.S. emphasis on resolving how to handle 
persons under control.  They cite the difficulties France is 
having trying to find a court to prosecute those they 
recently took into custody.  Under Belgian law, there must be 
a direct link to a Belgian entity for pirates to be tried in 
Belgian courts. It would be best to look to the neighboring 
countries to prosecute and incarcerate. Belgium is more than 
willing to provide moral support to countries active in 
interdicting the piracy. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On the issue of providing practical support to 
interdiction, Belgian Defense and Foreign ministries have 
taken an informal look at the availability of the country's 
sole available frigate (the other one is in drydock) in the 
future.  For now, the frigate is promised to UNAFIL, but it 
might be available to patrol off the Somali coast by late 
summer 2009 if intervention still would be needed.  Officials 
emphasized no political decision had been made regarding the 
frigate, but they are looking into options.
