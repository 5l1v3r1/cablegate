¶1.      (U) The Government of Bermuda (GOB) has reported six new 
confirmed cases of H1N1 on the Island in October and one in late 
September, bringing the total number of laboratory-confirmed 
cases from 10 (REFTEL) to 16 in Bermuda as of October 31. 
According to the Department of Health's website, there have been 
slightly more cases among males, and the majority of cases are 
aged 25-64 (six cases aged 26-44 and five cases aged 45-64, 7 
females and 9 males).  There have been no deaths on the Island 
attributed to the virus. 
 
 
 
¶2.      (SBU)  Minister of Health Walter Roban told the Consul 
General on October 26 that the GOB had budgeted funds to pay the 
UK for up to 50,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine, and the UK had 
agreed to pouch the vaccine when it became available and Bermuda 
requested.   Meanwhile, the GOB is offering regular flu shots 
throughout the Island.
