Â¶1.  (SBU) On September 5, 2006 post received and delivered 
Ref A demarche to Phasporn Sangasubana, Director of the 
Administrative Affairs Division, International Organization 
Bureau, at the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  Ms. 
Phasporn confirmed that Thailand "has a commitment to support 
Guatemala for the UNSC, but told Poloff that the other points 
in Ref A are handled by the Peace, Security, and Disarmament 
Division.  Ms. Phasporn informed Poloff that officials in 
that division who would be able to comment on these points 
have already left for Havana, Cuba.  Post is working with the 
Thai MFA North America Division to ensure that the Thai 
delegates receive these points in time to consider them prior 
to the beginning of the meeting on September 11, 2006.
