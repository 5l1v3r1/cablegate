SITE ASSESSMENTS AND MEETINGS 
 
¶2. (U)  Advisor, Program Assistant and embassy Political 
Officer visited Thai border crossings with Cambodia, June 
17-19 (see REFTEL).  Meetings were held with officials at 
Aranyaprathet, Baan Laem and Klong Yai crossing points. 
Representatives from Customs, Immigration, the military and 
police attended.  Aranyaprathet had been the site of 
International Border Interdiction Training (IBIT) in 
September, 2007.  Officials briefed on their skill 
sustainment training program and use of their donated 
equipment.  Party also met with the Commandant of the Royal 
Thai Marine Corps at Sattahip Naval Base.  The Marine Corps 
has overall responsibility for border security in Trat and 
Chantaburi provinces.  The main concerns currently are 
illegal drugs and smuggling, but these border stations will 
become more important as sub-regional trade increases through 
Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) infrastructure projects and 
Thai and Vietnamese nuclear power programs develop. 
 
¶3. (U) Advisor briefed members of the Cambodian National 
Counterterrorism Commission on the proposed EXBS program on 
June 23.  Officials agreed with the suggested activities.  In 
discussions with post, it appears that early October will be 
the best time to conduct the first event, a 1540 
Implementation Workshop.  Maritime-related training will 
supplement post,s current efforts in assisting the Cambodian 
government to establish a national Maritime Security Working 
Group.  Advisor also joined a meeting between post and 
Japanese embassy officials to discuss collaborative efforts 
for maritime security training under the aegis of the 
US-Australia-Japan trilateral partnership. 
 
¶4. (U) Advisor conducted a coordination visit on June 26 with 
Interdict/RADACAD staff of the Hazardous Materials Management 
and Emergency Response (HAMMER) Training Center, part of 
DOE,s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) complex 
in Richland, WA.   Advisor observed a class of Jordanian 
officials, and discussed training arrangements for a group of 
senior and working-level Vietnamese officials who will attend 
July 27-31.
