REF: STATE 18283 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  We engaged Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) 
Director of the Middle-East Division Nat Pinyowattanacheep 
March 6 regarding the review of U.S. policy in Iraq, 
including the drawdown and transformation of the U.S. force 
(reftel).  Nat replied that the RTG found the U.S. approach 
encouraging and would improve the U.S. image in Southeast 
Asia.  For its part, the Thai MFA was considering re-opening 
its embassy in Baghdad, though its Embassy in Amman, which 
covers Iraq, said the time was not yet right. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Director Nat also inquired about U.S. policy 
towards Iran and the Arab-Israeli Peace Process, 
characterizing the U.S. role as critical to achieving peace 
and stability in the region, much more so than other actors 
such as the EU, and praising the new Administration's 
approach and willingness to pursue dialogue.  We explained 
U.S. efforts, including the naming of Special Envoys Mitchell 
and Ross.  Nat suggested that achieving progress on Gaza was 
important from the ASEAN perspective, given the interest of 
Muslims in Indonesia, Malaysia, and southern Thailand have 
for the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and would 
also improve the standing of the U.S. in Southeast Asia.
