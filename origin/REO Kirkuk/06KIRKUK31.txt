¶1. This is a SET Tikrit cable.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2. In Salah Ad Din Province, a group of men is trying to tackle 
part of the employment problem.  They have devised a program 
very similar to the U.S. Civilian Conservation Corps, and hope 
to present it to the PRDC this month.  Funding is their current 
issue, and we are awaiting their plan to solve that issue. 
 
-------- 
PROPOSAL 
-------- 
 
¶3. A conversation about job training between our IRMO rep, SET 
Officer and a local Iraqi resulted in an Iraqi proposal to form 
a group very similar to President Roosevelt's Civilian 
Conservation Corps.  The program is proposed by five men from 
Salah Ad Din and Ninawa.  They developed a plan to cover a one 
year training program for 100 men, aged 18-27.  The program will 
instill discipline, life skills, and job skills in these 100 
men, preparing them to take their places in the Iraqi job 
market.  They want the proposal to be approved by the Salah Ad 
Din Provincial Council, to add legitimacy to the program. 
 
¶4.  The men behind the proposal cite the lack of jobs in this 
area as the main cause of security problems.  They also cite 
unemployment as a reason why young men fail to gain practical 
work experience: including timeliness, motivation, reliability 
and job savvy.   Their proposal is being finalized now. 
 
¶5.  The plan envisions 10 trainers, possibly unemployed former 
Iraqi Army personnel, being given further leadership training, 
and each leading a squad of 10 recruits.  These recruits will be 
unemployed or underemployed men of various backgrounds.  The 
recruits will wear uniforms, and go through a basic training 
schedule for a short period.  Physical and mental attention will 
be emphasized in this phase.  The next phase will involve job 
training in preparation for doing projects for various villages 
near the training area.  The project emphasis will be to improve 
the quality of life of the villagers, and showing provincial 
government support of their village. 
 
¶6.  This group sees the program as forming at the provincial 
level, drawing recruits from all parts of the province of Salah 
Ad Din.  After the initial group graduates, the proposal calls 
for expansion to other provinces, and perhaps to other training 
sites in Salah Ad Din.  Also, from this group of recruits will 
come follow-on staff members. 
 
--------- 
LOGISTICS 
--------- 
 
¶7.  Recruits will be provided with uniforms, meals, and other 
necessities.  Food will be prepared on-site, and recruits will 
help with the food preparation function on a rotating basis. 
Assigned vehicles will transport the recruits to near-by 
villages for their workday, and the recruits will each draw a 
small stipend for their work. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8.  This group of Iraqi men is pushing very hard to finalize 
this proposal.  Their next hurdle will be finding a donor to 
fund the initiative.  They are revising the budget, and are 
expecting to have it complete before mid-February.  This project 
has the potential to gather in disenfranchised young men, give 
them a job for a year, and prepare them to become employable in 
the future.  SET has informed USAID about the project, who will 
consider in due course whether it fits with USG goals.
