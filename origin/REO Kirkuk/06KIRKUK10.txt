SUBJECT: WASHINGTON POST FABRICATED STORY, ACCORDING TO SALAH AD DIN 
GOVERNOR 
 
¶1.  This is a SET Tikrit telegram. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2.  A January 12 Washington Post news article describes the 
Iraqi presidential palaces in Tikrit, formally known as FOB 
Danger.  The article claims to quote the Salah Ad Din provincial 
Governor as accusing his deputy and the ISF of looting the 
palace.  The Governor disputes the story, saying he did not 
speak to the Washington Post, nor accuse his deputy of looting. 
As of December 21, when rumors of massive looting were flying, 
SET officer found only relatively minor looting in palaces 
handed over to Iraqi control.

NEWS ARTICLE 
------------ 
 
¶3.  In a letter to the Al Sabah newspaper, Salah Ad Din Governor 
Sheik Hamed Shukti disputed the January 12 Washington Post 
article entitled "After Handover, Hussein Palaces Looted."  On 
January 14, Al Sabah printed a translation of the article. 
 
¶4. Governor Hamad said he did not give an interview to the 
Washington Post; however the article states it is quoting him 
directly from a telephone call.  The article quotes the Governor 
as saying that Iraqi soldiers and even his own deputy were 
responsible for looting the presidential palaces in Tikrit, just 
after the handover from U.S. to Iraqi control. 
 
¶5. The Governor said he would not use a foreign newspaper to 
criticize the ISF or the Deputy Governor, BGen Abdullah Jabarri. 
 The Governor accuses the reporter of submitting a "fake 
article" trying to show his neutrality while not having the full 
story.  The Governor then specifically said the accusations in 
the story are not true.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6.  These accusations were floating around Tikrit in 
mid-December.  SET officer toured the palaces, inside and out, 
on 21 December to discover the extent of the looting.  SET 
officer found minor incidents of draperies and some furniture 
missing.  He also found a broken door and a few broken windows. 
The biggest problem was many built-in air conditioners had been 
stolen, with the wires left dangling.  As compared to the 
rumors, there was very little damage to the facilities.  On 
January 23, the 101 ABN Div also investigated, and found minor 
damages.
