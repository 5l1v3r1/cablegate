¶1.  Summary.  The Dengue epidemic in Cape Verde has affected 
almost five percent of the population of the capital city of 
Praia, and five deaths have now occurred.  Eighteen more 
patients are hospitalized with the hemorrhagic form of the 
disease.  The number of suspected Dengue cases doubled over the 
course of the weekend, with a current estimate of 6,000 people 
infected.  The disease is present on seven of the nine inhabited 
islands of the archipelago.  In an effort to help health 
officials fight the disease,  the Minister of Defense is 
dispatching Cape Verde's military nationwide to search for and 
eliminate stagnant water that may be serving as breeding grounds 
for mosquitoes.  End summary 
 
¶2.  The number of suspected Dengue cases doubled 
from 3,000 to 6,000 in the three day period between Friday Oct 
30 and Monday Nov 2 , primarily in the capital city of Praia 
whose population is 125,000.  As of the morning of Tuesday, 
November 3, five people have died from internal hemorrhaging as 
a result of the disease.  The latest death was a 34 year old 
female official of the Foreign Ministry who was otherwise 
healthy.  Eighteen additional patients in the hemorrhagic stage 
of the disease are under treatment in Praia's primary hospital. 
Two of them are in critical condition.  The primary treatment 
methodology being used is to hydrate and provide nutrients 
intravenously, as well as provide transfusions to hemorrhaging 
patients.  Unfortunately, the local blood bank is already almost 
completely depleted, with no/no remaining stocks of any Rh 
negative blood. 
 
¶3.  The GoCV's preventive efforts include a 
televised campaign about mosquito avoidance, a live report by 
the Minister of Health on the November 3 evening news 
encouraging people with symptoms to report to local health 
centers, and deployment of the CV military to help eliminate 
stagnant water breeding grounds.    The World Health 
Organization has two missions on the ground, one setting up a 
testing facility (as reported reftel) and a second group 
exploring ways to eliminate the mosquito population.  A total of 
ten WHO experts is here at this time. 
 
¶4.  Post is in contact with the RMO and through him 
with MED to obtain information and advice.  One American local 
hire staff member is confirmed to have Dengue and several LES 
dependents are among the suspected cases.  Two of the 
Ambassador's three household staff members are also among the 
suspected cases.  Post's POC on this issue is Consular Chief 
Lesley Hayden (238-260-8907).  Updates will be provided as 
appropriate.
