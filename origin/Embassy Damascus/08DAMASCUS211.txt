¶1.  [SBU] SUMMARY: PAO and CAO embarked on a three-day trip to Hama, 
Homs, and Lattakia, March 3-5.  All three cities are in the 
central/coastal region of Syria.  A varied array of Syrians from all 
ethnic and religious backgrounds -- Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Christian 
-- welcomed them with open arms, in spite of the backdrop of events 
in Gaza and U.S. military ships off the coast of Syria.  Contacts 
included English teachers, USG program alumni, writers, students, 
university professors, and even a Dean at Al-Ba'ath University in 
Homs.  Ignoring an edict from the Ministry of Higher Education 
forbidding direct contacts with the American Cultural Center and 
other foreign entities (reftel), officials from the music education 
faculty displayed an eagerness for cooperation with the Center.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
Youth Alumni the Key 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  [SBU] PD Officers' experiences in Homs and Lattakia highlighted 
the importance of alumni contacts, especially with youth alumni.  In 
Homs, an informal meeting with a PLUS alumnus currently teaching at 
the music education faculty at Al-Ba'ath University serendipitously 
transformed into the first visit by the PAO and CAO to a Syrian 
university campus, a meeting with the Dean of the department, and a 
request from the University for cooperation with the American 
Cultural Center. The officers' mention of the impending visit of an 
American jazz performer in May generated great excitement.  The Dean 
brushed aside concerns about a ban by the Ministry of Higher 
Education on contact with the American Cultural Center. The music 
education department at Al-Ba'ath University is well-equipped, 
well-designed, and bustling with activity. 
 
¶3.  [SBU] In Lattakia, the officers visited an English language 
center opened by a recent Fulbright MA alumnus, which caters to an 
under-served, non-elite audience.  A meeting with a MEPI Summer 
Institute alumnus who teaches at Tishreen University and at a 
private English language institute gave the officers further insight 
into the state of English education in Lattakia. 
 
------------------ 
Thirst for English 
------------------ 
 
¶4.  [SBU] Both Homs and Lattakia boast a multitude of private 
foreign language centers, which compete fiercely for students and 
reputation.  PD officers met with directors and owners of such 
institutes and spoke with them about opportunities for cooperation 
and resources available to aid English teaching, including English 
language fellows, exchange programs, and information resources. 
These centers enroll from a few hundred to a few thousand students, 
many of them university students looking to improve their English. 
They are an excellent conduit for outreach to university students in 
an environment where our normal channels of engagement with 
universities are blocked. 
 
¶5.  [SBU] COMMENT:  The PAO and CAO's experience shows that 
successful in-country travel is still possible despite the security 
services' active efforts to subvert it.  All the individuals with 
whom the officers met expressed enthusiasm for cooperation, and all 
stressed the importance of connecting Americans and Syrians at the 
educational and cultural levels despite current political tensions. 
 PD Damascus plans to capitalize upon this fertile environment with 
more in-country travel, cultural outreach (musicians, artists, 
writers), a continued strong program of English language teaching 
and training, and frequent contact with program alumni, especially 
youth.  END COMMENT.
