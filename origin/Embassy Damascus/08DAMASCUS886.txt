 "For a Dialogue That Eliminates Fears" 
An editorial in SARG-owned Al-Thawra on December 14 read:  "The 
positions expressed by Carter in Damascus constitute a demand and a 
need that has been absent from U.S. discourse for many years...

U.S.... The U.S. dialogue that Carter talked about is necessary at 
all times, not only with the region, but also with the world at 
large... 
"Syria, which has called for dialogue in all circumstances, sees in 
the American direction announced by former President Carter a new 
era and a horizon which opens the door to an important stage in the 
American political approach towards the region..."
