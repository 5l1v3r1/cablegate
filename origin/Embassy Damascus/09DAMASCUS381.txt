SINGLE COUNTRY PROGRAMS 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post proposes a SCP for Syria with the title "Preventing 
Domestic Violence and Abuse."  A small number of women's shelters 
and an abuse hotline currently exist in Damascus, catering to both 
Syrian women and Iraqi refugees who have been abused and/or 
trafficked.  It is a Mission priority to help both communities and 
to highlight for the general public and the Syrian government the 
importance of protecting women and families from abuse.  The program 
can be based on the existing RP offered for FY2010, with the 
SYRIA 
 
addition of one or two days of conflict resolution training at a 
U.S. university.  The training will help the volunteers work better 
with a religiously and ethnically diverse clientele.  The program 
will include 5-8 volunteers who work with NGOs and shelters 
providing protection and healthcare services to abused women and 
children.  The preferred timeframe for the program is the first two 
weeks of October 2009 due to the university schedules of several of 
the participants. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post proposes a second SCP for Syria with the title 
"Sustainable Urban Development."  A huge population boom, combined 
with urban sprawl, limited water resources, insufficient electrical 
capacity, illegal housing and inadequate sewage systems are just a 
few of the challenges confronting urban planners in Syria.  Syria's 
sprawling bureaucracy and outdated laws are ill-equipped to cope 
with the challenges of the 21st century.  Urban planners arguing for 
sustainable development are often outnumbered by wealthy businessmen 
who want to promote tourism or factories at the expense of the 
environment or the surrounding community.  This SCP is an 
opportunity for Syrian participants to explore sustainable 
development practices to reduce air and water pollution, to improve 
sanitation and waste management, to improve the transportation 
infrastructure, and the provision of water, electricity and other 
utilities.  This 9 person team of Syrians will be led by the private 
sector urban planning consultant who is advising the Syrian 
government.  The additional team members represent the key action 
officers in Syria's governorates: Aleppo, Homs, Damascus and 
Al-Jazeera.  This SCP will be an ideal opportunity for the team to 
coordinate their urban planning vision for Syria, develop concrete 
plans, and gain experience and ideas from the U.S. experience. The 
proposed timeframe for this program is between mid October and early 
November, 2009. 
 
¶5.  (U) Post has submitted individual nominations for each program 
through EVDB.
