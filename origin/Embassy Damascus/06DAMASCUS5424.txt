--------------------------- 
 
"So Arabs do not Lament" 
 
--------------------------- 
 
Dr. Buthaina Sha'ban, Minister Expatriate Affairs, wrote in her 
weekly column in government-owned Tishreen, (12/19):  "There are 
some efforts and arguments in the West that serve Arab rights, such 
as former US President Jimmy Carter's new book, the recommendations 
of the Iraq Study Group, the farewell speech by UN Secretary General 
Kofi Annan, and the book by American Judge Elizabeth de la Vega.... 
But for Arabs to benefit from these voices, they need to renounce 
their differences and convey the painful reality of the region to 
the conscience of the international community.... 
 
"We lament the fact that Arabs are busy with the theories of 
moderation versus extremism, Sunnis versus Shiite, Fatah versus 
HAMAS, and so on -- theories that were created for Arabs by their 
enemies.... 
 
"The Arab political and intellectual elite must embrace their 
rights, take pride in their identity, and join forces with these 
rising international forces to convey the issue of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict and its results in Iraq, Palestine, and Lebanon to the 
living world conscience with a view to achieve justice and human 
dignity for Arab men, women, and children." 
 
---------------------------------- 
 
"A Crisis Heralding a Catastrophe" 
 
---------------------------------- 
Umar Jaftali, a commentator in government-owned Tishrin, wrote 
(12/19):  "The Palestinian infighting serves Israel's interests as 
it wastes Palestinian resources and capabilities and allows Israel 
to wriggle out of the peace requirements and complete the 
implementation of its hostile Zionist plan.... 
 
"There is a foreign plan to liquidate the Palestinian cause....  All 
Palestinians must avoid splits and divisions, return to national 
dialogue, and unify their ranks and efforts against the Israeli 
occupation...." 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
"Israeli Worry about Baker-Hamilton Recommendations" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
Ibrahim Shuqayr, a commentator in government-owned Al-Ba'th, wrote 
(12/19):  "The Baker-Hamilton recommendations have caused great fear 
for the majority of Israelis, especially the linking of the Iraq 
problem and the Arab-Israeli conflict.... 
 
"Although these recommendations are not binding, they showed the 
mistakes of the US Administration when it turned its back on the 
peace process in the region, practiced deception, demonstrated 
stubbornness and blind bias toward and surrender to Israel, and 
disregarded all the international efforts to establish peace in the 
region.... 
 
"The Baker-Hamilton recommendations remain a realistic option 
available to the US Administration to deal with them as one package, 
correct the course, and provide a way to address the other crises in 
the region. Without this, the US Administration will not arrive at 
any result and will continue to face problems, failures, and hatred 
in the region...."
