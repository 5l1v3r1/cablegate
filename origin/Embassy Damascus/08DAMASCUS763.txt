ATTACK 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary and Comment:  Public Affairs Staff reached out to 
Syrian contacts and monitored online news sources to gauge public 
opinion following the alleged U.S. military attack in Abu Kamal on 
October 26.  These contacts and sources offered unfiltered and 
candid responses.  Most expressed confusion about the reasoning 
behind the attack, which has led to widespread speculation about its 
true aim.  Others questioned the reliability of SARG-controlled 
media reports and the effects of closing U.S. facilities.  While the 
predominant reaction was confusion, some contacts expressed clear 
anger about the attack.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
----------------------------- 
Why did the U.S. Attack Now? 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Contacts questioned the rationale for the attacks; most 
believe it was motivated by the upcoming Presidential elections.  A 
journalist stated:  "The Americans cannot make Obama win.  It is 
obvious: Bush has done this to frighten the American people and make 
them vote for the Republicans, who are known for their warrior 
attitude."  A senior editor disagreed: "Even if McCain wins it won't 
be because of this. The Americans have had enough of war."  He 
attributed the attacks to a U.S. desire to spoil improving 
Syrian-Iraqi relations: "There are some circles in Washington who 
are not happy with the improvement in Syrian-Iraqi relations.  Prime 
Minister Otri was about to leave for Baghdad on an official visit 
that might have changed the face of the region.  This did not 
satisfy those circles, who created this raid to foil the 
improvement, and this is the result." 
 
--------------------------------- 
"Very Bad, The Worst I Have Seen" 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) A well-placed Syrian contact close to the Public Affairs 
staff observed that anger toward the U.S. is "very bad, the worst" 
she has seen.  She confided that "the issue for people is respect 
for borders," referring to Syria's national sovereignty.  The 
prevailing view, she said, is that "the U.S. does whatever it wants. 
 We [Syria] need to find a way to retaliate."  Another contact 
stressed that "the Israeli attacks were bad enough, but this 
[attack] is worse, because people were killed.  The [Syrian] 
government had to take a stance to keep the people's respect.  This 
is the worst thing so far, because it involved scenes of dead 
children."  A greengrocer stated: "The evil Americans -- what else 
can we expect from them?" 
 
---------------------------------- 
Are the Syrian Media Reports True? 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) While the government propaganda machine was in full swing, 
not surprisingly, its reporting generated some skepticism.  A local 
journalist commented: "The government says there were kids. 
Journalists who visited the area said they saw seven bodies - all 
adults."  [Note: This refers to an AP report from the funeral of 
those killed in the attack.  The AP reporter noted he saw seven 
bodies of the reported eight dead, but all appeared to be adults. 
End Note].  A Syrian political activist stated: "It will relieve us 
if the White House explains why the raid took place.  If it was 
really about chasing Al-Qaeda, and if the Americans could kill or 
capture a senior Al-Qaeda figure, it will relieve us.  But now it is 
difficult for us to defend the Administration and even to defend the 
Embassy." 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Public Mixed about Closing U.S. Facilities 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The public has become vocal about the SARG request for the 
U.S. Embassy to close the American Cultural Center and the Damascus 
Community School.  A female activist questioned, "What can they 
[students] do now? Where can they go?"  She expressed her sympathies 
for the students who are "negatively affected by politics."  Another 
commented that she hoped it was only a "temporary closure."  Other 
activists expressed personal concern, because many study English at 
the American Language Center, and asked: "What if the Embassy 
responds by closing the consular section? Who will be the losers 
then?" 
 
¶6.  (SBU) As news of reported or possible closures began to hit the 
press, the Educational Advising and Testing Office at the American 
Cultural Center was flooded with phone calls from students and 
parents concerned about upcoming tests (SAT, TOEFL, GRE) and how 
events would affect their ability to study in the United States. 
They were not deterred.  Similarly, Syrian Fulbright nominees 
e-mailed and called the CAO to express concern about the Cultural 
Center and its staff's safety and to inquire about their 
scholarships. 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) An online commentor asserted that the SARG "has to close 
the U.S. Embassy until an official response [to the raid] from the 
USG has been received, to explain that they are cowards and 
terrorists."  Another asked: "Who needs such an embassy?! I hope 
they [the SARG] kick out the U.S. Ambassador as well."  [Note: 
Embassy Damascus has not had an ambassador since 2005.  End Note.] 
 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Comment:  Interestingly, most Syrian contacts and on-line 
commentators expressed not anger, but confusion, over the alleged 
U.S. attack, in particular its timing.  It is also clear that 
elements within Syria hostile to the U.S. will use this opportunity 
to foster anti-U.S. sentiment.  In the absence of a clear U.S. 
response to these attacks, many contacts noted, speculation about 
its true intent will only continue.  End Comment.
