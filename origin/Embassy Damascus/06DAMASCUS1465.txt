¶1.  Summary: Syrian papers reported President Asad's meeting 
with a US delegation from the Churches Panel for Peace in the 
Middle East, in which he reiterated the importance of 
coexistence and dialogue on all levels, asserting that 
all heavenly religions call for amity, moderation and humanity. 
Talks also dealt with the ongoing reforms in Syria and the 
influence of the regional situation on the reform process, in 
addition to the issue of combating terrorism and extremism. The 
President and the delegation reviewed the necessity of ensuring 
security and stability in the region. President Asad reminded 
the delegation of Syria's continued endeavors for peace in the 
Middle East and its commitment to UN resolutions as the terms of 
reference for the realization of security, peace and stability 
in the region. 
 
Syrian papers also reported Vice President Shara's meeting with 
Information Minister Muhsen Bilal and directors and editors-in- 
chief of media institutions, in which he described the Arab 
Summit in Khartoum as "successful" and "positive." 
 
Papers also featured a statement by Nabih Berri, Speaker of the 
Lebanese Parliament, preceding resumption of the Lebanese 
national dialogue and stressing that "Syrian-Lebanese relations 
are relations of kinship, neighborhood and brotherhood." 
 
"We didn't hold a single session without Israeli planes 
violating our airspace.... So our main concern is the Israeli 
assaults, and not the arms that are in our hands for a strategic 
defensive plan pertaining to the Israeli occupation," Berri 
said. 
 
"Lebanon's strength is not in its weakness but in the 
resistance," Berri added, saying that the "issue of Hizbollah 
can only be solved unanimously." 
 
End of summary.

--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
"Dangers of the US-Israeli Policies on the Arab Region" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
Nasim al-Damuni, in an op-ed in government-owned Al-Ba'th, wrote 
(4/3): "Israel, in the US strategy, is a military base used to 
oppress any pan-Arab or national liberation movement in the 
region. 
 
"Successive US administrations have always sought to find a 
formula for US-Israeli relations that will not negatively affect 
US-Arab relations so as to create a balance. In order to 
further reinforce US-Israeli relations, the two countries signed 
the Strategic Cooperation Agreement in 1981--an agreement that 
shows a total US bias toward Israel. 
 
"US military support for the Zionist entity is aimed at 
preserving Zionist superiority over Arab countries on the pretext 
of maintaining a balance of power in the region. Said strategic 
agreement has given the Zionist entity a distinguished status in 
the US global strategy, without which the Zionist entity would 
have collapsed as a result of its economic and social problems. 
 
"This may create a historic crisis for Arabs because of their 
dependence on the US in resolving the Arab-Zionist conflict. At 
a time when the US ignores the Zionist entity's nuclear arsenal, 
it accuses the DPRK and Iran of possessing or trying to possess 
nuclear weapons.... 
 
"The Arab countries must draw up a clear-cut strategy in light 
of the current disparity in the balance of power in the region."

"These Are Human Rights in America" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
 
Issa al-Shammas, a columnist in government-owned Al-Thawra, 
wrote (4/3): "In its annual Human Rights Report, the US condemns 
this or that country for violating human rights, ignoring its 
own violations of the human right of individuals, nations, and 
countries....  This is in addition to its serious human rights 
violations in Guantanamo and Abu Ghurayb prisons, which have 
drawn international condemnation....  The US arrests, imprisons, 
and tortures opponents of its policies without trial.... US and 
British soldiers chase and even beat Iraqi citizens to death 
before the eyes of the world community.... 
 
"For their part, Zionist forces have recently stormed the 
Jericho prison and abducted the Secretary General of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine in violation of 
international laws and norms.... 
 
"In the US view the invasion of countries is not a violation of 
human rights...." 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
"US Testimony on Failure of War on Iraq" 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
Ali Sawwaha, a columnist in government-owned Al-Thawra, wrote 
(4/3): "Once again, US President Bush has held the Iraqi people 
responsible for the absence of security in Iraq.... By this, he 
has ignored the fact that the reason behind the current chaos in 
Iraq is the US presence.... 
 
"The US President has not yet realized that his project in Iraq 
has failed and that the drop in his popularity is due to his 
unjust war against Iraq.... For their part, US research centers 
say that the United States has made grave mistakes in Iraq by 
discharging the Iraqi Army and security forces and ignoring the 
weight of Iraqi resistance...."
