¶2.  (U) The following are political updates: 
 
-- Spanish FM Miguel Angel Moratinos met August 2 in Damascus 
with Syrian FM Walid Mu'allim, with talks focusing on the 
Israel-Hizballah conflict and international efforts for 
long-term regional stability, according to the official 
Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA).  Moratinos was quoted as 
saying that his talks with Mu'allim focused on the need for 
an immediate cease-fire.  Moratinos was set to meet August 3 
with Syrian President Bashar al-Asad and Syrian VP Farouk 
al-Shara'a.  EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana announced 
earlier this week that Moratinos would travel to Damascus to 
hold talks on behalf of the 25-nation EU bloc.

Mu'allim August 2 to discuss the outcome of the EU foreign

the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) SYG, and 
Lebanon's FM on  August 2 in Malaysia, prior to an OIC

Talks dealt with the Israel-Hizballah conflict, the

from 85 inquiries the previous day. 
 
ECONOMIC 
 
¶4.  (U) A UN aid convoy set to depart Syria for Lebanon on 
August 2 was delayed for "logistical problems," according to 
an Agence France Presse (AFP) report.  Three convoys of 20 
trucks have already crossed from Syria into Lebanon, 
presumably at Syria's Al-Arida border crossing, carrying 135 
tons of aid, including tents, mattresses, blankets, cooking 
materials, medicines and sanitary products, AFP reported.  As 
far as Post knows, the Masna-Jdeideh crossing on the main 
Damascus-Beirut highway remains closed.
