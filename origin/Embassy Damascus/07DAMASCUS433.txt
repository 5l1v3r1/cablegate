¶2.  (SBU) THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF THE CANADIAN STATEMENT: 
 
THE HONORABLE PETER MACKAY, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND 
MINISTER OF THE ATLANTIC CANADA OPPORTUNITIES AGENCY, TODAY 
MADE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT ON THE APRIL 24 TRIAL AND 
SENTENCING OF HUMAN RIGHTS LAWYER ANWAR AL-BUNNI TO FIVE 
YEARS' DETENTION, AS WELL AS THE CONDUCT OF THE APRIL 22 AND 
23 LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS: 
 
"THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE OUTCOME 
OF THE TRIAL OF ANWAR AL-BUNNI ON CHARGES RELATED TO HIS 
EFFORTS TO BUILD A CULTURE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN SYRIA AND 
DENOUNCE TORTURE IN SYRIAN PRISONS. WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE ONGOING TRIALS OF OPPOSITION FIGURE KAMAL LABWANI 
AND INTELLECTUALS MICHEL KILO, MAHMOUD 'ISSA, KHALIL HUSSEIN 
AND SULEIMAN AL-SHUMMAR. 
 
"SYRIA MUST ENSURE THAT ITS DOMESTIC LAWS AND PRACTICES ARE 
IN KEEPING WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS OBLIGATIONS. 
CANADA URGES SYRIA TO RELEASE ALL POLITICAL PRISONERS AND 
TAKE CONCRETE STEPS TOWARD RESPECTING AND PROTECTING HUMAN 
RIGHTS, AND GUARANTEEING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, ASSEMBLY AND 
ASSOCIATION, STARTING WITH THE RECALL OF ITS 44-YEAR-OLD 
EMERGENCY LAW. SYRIA MUST ALSO TAKE FIRM MEASURES TO STOP 
ARBITRARY ARREST, INCOMMUNICADO DETENTION, TORTURE AND CRUEL, 
INHUMAN AND DEGRADING TREATMENT, AS WELL AS TO INVESTIGATE 
ALLEGATIONS OF THESE PRACTICES, PROSECUTE PERPETRATORS AND 
PROVIDE REMEDIES FOR THE VICTIMS. 
 
"THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA IS FURTHERMORE CONCERNED WITH THE 
SHORTCOMINGS OF THE SYRIAN ELECTION LAW, SYSTEM AND PROCESS. 
SYRIA SHOULD GUARANTEE ITS CITIZENS THE RIGHT TO GENUINELY 
DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATIVE AND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, AS PART OF 
A FULLY FAIR AND PARTICIPATORY POLITICAL PROCESS, AS PART OF 
A MOVE TOWARD PROVIDING ITS CITIZENS FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE RULE OF LAW."
