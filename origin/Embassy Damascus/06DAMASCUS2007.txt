SUBJECT: Damascus Media Reaction: US Report on Terrorism, 
Fundraising for Palestinians, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran (5/2) 
 
 
¶1. Summary: Syrian papers cited a statement by Dr. Imad Mustafa, 
the Syrian ambassador in Washington, that the "US State 
Department report on terrorism is a new link in a series of 
reports that the United States issues for political reasons 
against those who do not agree with it or go along with its 
policy regarding its claims about terrorism." 
 
Dr. Mustafa said: "With regard to Syria, the report is 
contradictory. While the US Administration continues to classify 
Syria among the countries that sponsor terrorism, it clearly 
indicates that Syria was not involved in any terrorist act. It 
also clearly indicates that Syria differentiates between so- 
called terrorism and resistance, which it considers a right of 
nations. Yet the US Administration says Syria supports 
organizations that the United States labels as terrorist, such 
as Hizbollah, HAMAS, and Islamic Jihad." He added: "From this 
premise, we can judge the report as a flagrantly biased 
political document." 
 
Dr Mustafa said: "I personally believe that such bias does not 
help the United States focus its efforts on the fight against 
real terrorism. On the contrary, it keeps the US policy hostage 
to the interests of the extremist policy."  He criticized 
"Washington's disregard for the terrorist acts (state terrorism) 
that Israel practices against the Palestinians, particularly 
targeted killing...." 
 
Papers also reported that HAMAS has thanked Syria for the 
assistance Syria has offered to Palestinians and their elected 
government. "The Syrian donation came in spite of the efforts of 
the US Administration to besiege the Palestinian people for the 
benefit of Israel and all the pressure it applies to achieve this 
goal on the regional and international levels," the HAMAS 
statement said. HAMAS called on Arab and Islamic nations to adopt 
practical measures to enhance and increase support for the 
Palestinian people and government, to reject US pressures and to 
launch official and popular campaigns to achieve this support. 
 
End of summary.

¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
------------------------------- 
 
"Ignored Facts about Terrorism" 
 
------------------------------- 
 
 
Muhamed Khair Al-Jamali, an editorialist in government-owned Al- 
Thawra, commented (5/2): "The US Administration, through its 
annual report on terrorism, tries to blame others for its 
failure to realize its own objectives.... The US State 
Department report on terrorism accused Syria and Iran of 
supporting terrorism without giving a single piece of evidence 
to prove these accusations.... 
 
"Apart from leveling unsubstantiated or unfair accusations 
against Syria, the report deliberately ignores a number of basic 
facts about terrorism: its definition, the best ways to fight 
it, Syria's real cooperation against it, and Iraq's role in 
fanning its flames.... 
 
"The United States and Israel have always refused to define 
terrorism because they want to classify resistance against 
occupation as terrorism.... Washington and Tel Aviv also 
insisted on a security approach to terrorism and refused to 
address its root causes.... 
 
"If we add to this the fact that many American officials have 
testified that Syria has saved the lives of many Americans as a 
result of its past cooperation, and the fact that the major US 
policy mistake of invading Iraq provided fertile soil for the 
growth of violence and terrorism, the US State Department report 
will be exposed as a report lacking any credibility, meant only 
to cover the mistakes of American policy by blaming their 
repercussions on Syria and every country that refuses to 
surrender to the logic of dictates, arrogance, and threats."

"On the National Day of Support for Palestinians" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
An unsigned editorial in government-owned Al-Ba'th on (5/2) 
reads: "The donation campaign is a new opportunity through which 
Syrians show the extent of their commitment to fateful Arab 
issues.... For decades Syria has sponsored the plan of 
resistance and opposition.... This subjected Syria to pressure 
and conspiracies. But all pressure has failed to force Damascus 
to change its position.... 
 
"The Syrian fundraising campaign activates the role of the Arab 
public in general to break the siege that Israel is imposing on 
Palestinians.... Danger surrounds Palestinians depending on 
American and European aid and Israeli tax transfers.... Arabs 
and Moslems must be responsible for funding Palestinians.... 
 
"Foreign funding of Palestinians must come to an end.... It is 
very costly for the Palestinian cause and Palestinian rights, as 
the experience of the post-Oslo agreement has shown...."
