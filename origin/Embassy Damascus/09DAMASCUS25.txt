Â¶1. Sarkozy's Visit:  All Syrian papers dedicated banner headlines to 
French President Sarkozy's meeting with President Asad and drew 
extensively from the SANA press release for the substance of their 
reporting. 
While the Syrian press focused on President Assad's call for an 
immediate end to Israel's "barbaric aggression," and Syria's vision 
for a solution, the regional media and international wires focused 
on Sarkozy urging Assad to exert pressure on Hamas in order to 
listen to "the voice of reason and opt for reconciliation and 
peace." 
"Pressure should be exerted on all parties involved, including 
Hamas, in order for the guns to fall silent and peace to return," 
Sarkozy said. "President Bashar Asad can play a major role in this. 
Syria must help us to convince Hamas to choose the voice of reason 
and peace."  The regional media noted that Asad did not respond to 
Sarkozy's request, instead Asad said that the Israeli offensive in 
Gaza "must halt." 
After the talks, President Asad and President Sarkozy held a joint 
press conference, where President Asad condemned continuing Israeli 
incursion citing the heaving casualties among Palestinian civilians. 
President Sarkozy sought to push Syria into playing a more 
constructive role: 
"Syria can offer full contribution. Syria had already indicated that 
when it started indirect negotiations with Israel through the 
Turkish mediation. France, Turkey and Syria work on the same point 
and determination. We know you want peace, and Syria indicated that 
it works for peace as shown in Doha Agreement." 
UN Security Council Resolution: 
All Syrian papers reported that the UN Security Council Ministerial 
convened yesterday to debate an Arab resolution on Gaza.  Coverage 
featured U.S. Ambassador to the UN Zalamai Khalilzad's statement in 
which he described a UN resolution imposing an immediate ceasefire 
in Gaza as "mere illusions."  There was no additional coverage of 
the U.S. role or that of other Arab countries. 
Israel's shelling of UNRWA Schools: 
Papers condemned Israeli forces' shelling of Palestinian civilians 
in three UNRWA schools in the Gaza Strip that resulted in the 
killing of 50 Palestinians.  Independent al-Watan quoted UNSYG Ban 
Ki Moon who described it "as unacceptable to all," saying that he 
warned Israeli authorities that these schools were used as shelters 
for homeless Palestinians." Al-Watan claimed that this massacre 
prompted a change in the U.S. position, mis-quoting State Department 
Spokesman as saying that "Washington seeks an immediate and 
sustainable ceasefire in Gaza...rather than a temporary and limited 
ceasefire." 
HAMAS: 
While Syrian papers completely ignored the visit to Cairo by a high 
ranking Hamas delegation to discuss a new ceasefire initiative in 
Gaza, regional papers focused on this story.  Al Hayat reported that 
the Head of the Egyptian Intelligence Omar Suleiman told the Hamas 
delegation to recalibrate its demands to end the violence in Gaza. 
Syrian papers did, however, report on Khaled Mashaal's meeting in 
Damascus with a Jordanian "popular" delegation who came to express 
solidarity with the Palestinian people. 
Al-Watan also reported that while Venezuela expelled the Israeli 
Ambassador to Caracas, Egypt continued to prohibit Arab and European 
medical teams from using the Rafah crossing to deliver food and 
medicine to Gaza. 
 
Obama's Reaction: 
 
All papers reported carried U.S. President-elect Obama's statement 
in which he expressed concern over the mounting  civilian casualties 
and that he would adhere to his campaign promise of engaging on the 
Middle East Peace Process. 
Selected Editorial: 
"Choices between Death and Resistance" 
Samira Masalmeh, Chief Editor of government-owned Tishreen, 
commented (1/7):  "What is required from the Palestinian resistance 
fighters after this bloodshed? Are they required to stop defending 
their land and people and surrender their arms to Israelis? What 
options are left to them? 
"Do they have to choose between slow death from starvation and 
siege, and quick death from the Israeli holocaust? 
"It seems that they have opted to die with dignity amid the silence 
of those who have no dignity..."
