SUBJECT: ASAD CONFIDENT ABOUT CURRENT SITUATION, WELCOMES
U.S. ENGAGEMENT WITH SYRIA

Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Stephen A. Seche, per 1.4 b,d.

¶1. (C) Summary: Syrian President Bashar al-Asad met for
an hour July 25 with David Lesch , his American biographer,
who is in country with his family for a short visit. Asad
appeared relaxed and confident about the way events were
playing out in Lebanon. He mentioned the possibility of
Syrian intervention in the conflict but did not seem to be
considering the option in a serious way, according to Lesch.
Asad expressed a desire for an American mediation effort that
would include Syria, Lesch told the Charge during a
subsequent readout. End Summary.

¶2. (C) Syrian President Bashar al-Asad appeared confident
and relatively content with the way the situation in Lebanon
has played out, according to his American biographer, David
Lesch, who met with him at his in-town residence, Tishreen
Palace, July 25. Lesch provided a readout for Charge and
PolChief the following day, noting that Asad clearly
communicated the sense that "he had been dealt back into the
game" as a result of the two weeks of fighting in Lebanon
between Israel and Hizballah. Asad did not seem worried that
Israel would eventually crush Hizballah with its overwhelming
military superiority. According to Lesch, Asad at one point
noted that the image of Israeli military invincibility had
been destroyed in the current conflict.

¶3. (C) Asad spoke at one point about the possibility of
Syria entering the war if Israel invaded Lebanon. Lesch said
he responded that Israel had already done so, and asked Asad
if he had any line in mind that, if crossed, would trigger
Syrian intervention. Asad told him that his generals were
looking at this issue and considering different scenarios, a
response that to Lesch indicated that Asad's mention of the
possibility was more rhetorical than real.

¶4. (C) When asked if Syria would accept diplomatic mediation
by European parties to help resolve the conflict in Lebanon,
Asad said he would not rule out such efforts, but voiced a
preference for U.S. engagement directly with Syria on this
and other issues. In response to Lesch's inquiry about
President Bush's offhand comments about Syria to PM Blair,
Asad laughed and said that in general he was pleased because
it indicated that the U.S. was at least thinking about Syria.
Asad expressed a longing for a comprehensive approach that
would reach beyond the current conflict and include issues
such as the occupied Golan Heights. He noted wistfully that
if he could succeed in getting the Golan back, he would be a
hero to the Syrian people. (According to Lesch, although
Asad did not refer to Iran directly or the issue of
facilitating Iranian support for Hizballah, several other
officials with whom he met separately insisted that Syria
would abandon its alliance with Iran if the U.S. would engage
and stop trying to isolate and pressure Syria.)

¶5. (C) Lesch's wife and 16-year old son accompanied him to an
initial 20-minute meeting with Asad that also included First
Lady Asma al-Asad. Lesch described the interaction between
the couple as natural and informal, with the nor粑al
back-and-forth banter of a couple obviously at ease with each
other. Asad spoke in English, without interpreter, during
the private one-on-one the two subsequently held. Asad lent
his camera to Lesch's son. He held out the possibility he
might meet with Lesch again before he departed the evening of
July 26.

¶6. (C) Lesch met a range of Syrian officials, including
Minister of Higher Education Ghiath Barakat, as well as other
prominent Syrians, at a series of dinners and other more
informal encounters. He also gave an interview on Syrian TV.
Lesch is the author of Bashar al-Asad, the Lion of Damascus.
He noted that Asad was aware that he would be seeing USG
officials after his meeting and assumed Asad wanted to use
such meetings to inform and help shape USG perceptions.
