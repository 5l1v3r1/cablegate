SUBJECT: SYRIA PROPOSAL FOR 2007 AMBASSADOR FUND FOR 
 
REFUGEES 
 
 ¶1.  (U) Request:  Post requests $20,000 from the Ambassador 
Fund for Refugees for the NGO LIFE for Relief and Development 
for a 10-day summer camp in August 2007 that would benefit 80 
Iraqi and 20 Syrian children from eight to 12 years old. 
 
¶2.  (U) Background and justification:  LIFE for Relief and 
Development was founded in 1992 by Iraqi Americans.  Its 
Syria office is registered with the Syrian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs/International Organizations and Conferences 
Department, according to organization literature.  LIFE 
coordinates relief and development projects in Syria with the 
Syrian Arab Red Crescent and is expected to become an 
implementing partner for a PRM-funded CARE project in Syria. 
There are very few functional NGOs on the ground in Syria; 
LIFE was the only organization that provided Ambassador Fund 
proposals on a tight deadline.  Objectives for this project 
include: 
 
-- Provide creative and recreational activities for 
vulnerable Iraqi children; 
-- Help them integrate into the host community; 
-- Raise hygiene awareness; 
-- Teach them handicrafts; 
-- Provide good nutrition via two daily meals during the camp 
and distribute non-food items. 
 
Of the more than 1 million Iraqis who have fled the Iraqi 
conflict to Syria, almost 300,000 are believed to be 
school-age children, according to UNICEF.  Most are not in 
school and most live in cramped urban areas with little 
recreational space.  This project would reach only a small 
number of Iraqi children but would be part of efforts by 
other NGOs and would encourage further such activities.  LIFE 
would also include poor Syrian children as part of its 
efforts to integrate Iraqis into the host society. 
Additionally, the inclusion of Syrian children would give 
this project a better chance of not being blocked by Syrian 
authorities.  Cost per child per day for the Ambassador Fund 
would be USD 20.
