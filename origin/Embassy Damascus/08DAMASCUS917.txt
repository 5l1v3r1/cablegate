SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR SECTION 565 WAIVER OF PROHIBITION 
AGAINST CONTRACTING WITH FIRMS THAT COMPLY WITH THE ARAB 
LEAGUE BOYCOTT OR DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF RELIGION 
 
REF: STATE 132944 
 
¶1. (SBU) We have reviewed the requirements of Section 565 of 
the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for 1994 and 1995 
(Public Law 1103-236) and reaffirm our position that it is in 
the best interest of the United States Government to request 
waivers to the Arab League Boycott Compliance Prohibitions 
and the provisions of non discrimination on the basis of 
religion.  The waiver is in the national interest and it is 
necessary to carry on post diplomatic functions. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Waiver of the Arab League Boycott Certification: 
Without the waiver of the anti-boycott certification, our 
Mission would be unable to obtain essential supplies and 
services within the country, either because local firms are 
required by law to comply with the boycott and could not sign 
the required certification without exposing themselves to 
civil and criminal penalties, or because an overwhelming 
majority of suppliers would refuse to certify, or if the 
matter became public, would be prevented or deterred from 
certifying. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Waiver of the Religious Discrimination 
Certification: Pervasive SARG controls would intimidate 
vendors into non-certification: Without local supplies of 
essential goods and services, it would be impractical for 
this Mission to carry out diplomatic functions.  The 1973 
Syrian Constitution requires that the Syrian President be 
Muslim.  The Syrian government may be considered tolerant 
regarding the practice of individual religious beliefs; 
however, the reality is that certain religious and ethnic 
groups come under more scrutiny than others.  Procurement 
activities that include a written affirmation that the 
contractor does not discriminate on the basis of religion are 
problematic.  While we have no evidence that local 
businessmen discriminate in their business dealings, in light 
of the regime's sensitivity to issues related to religion and 
ethnicity, no local businessman would sign a written 
certification proclaiming non-discrimination, particularly in 
regards to the Jewish faith or Israel.  Syria has not signed 
a peace agreement with Israel and public sentiment about 
Israeli-occupied territories in the Golan area remains strong. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Signing the non-discrimination statement would 
likely cause unwanted and undue scrutiny: The SARG maintains 
close observation of individuals who are associated with the 
Embassy and government security services routinely interview 
these individuals.  Any statement placing the businessman or 
family in a potentially difficult situation with the 
government must be avoided. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Therefore, Embassy Damascus requersts a waiver of 
the Arab League Boycott Certification and Non-Discrimination 
Clause of section 565.
