CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 24262 
 
Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn confirmed to Ambassador on 11 
March that Luxembourg will not be sending a representative to 
the 14 March conference on Lebanese democracy in Beirut. 
Luxembourg's small Foreign Ministry combined with their lack 
of significant manpower and representation in the region does 
not make it feasible for Luxembourg to send a representative 
to the conference.
