(SBU) Pol/econ officer delivered points contained reftel to 
Jean-Louis Thill, MFA Coordinator for Near and Middle-Eastern 
Affairs on 7 December.  Thill said that Luxembourg would be 
sending a delegation to the 17 December donors conference and 
that the delegation would be headed by FM Jean Asselborn. 
Regarding pledges, Thill said that final amounts have not yet 
been decided, but called our attention to the fact that 
Luxembourg has been actively involved in the Palestinian 
Territories and in 2007 donated 4.2M EUR in development and 
cooperation assistance.  Thill further noted that for each of 
the past several years Luxembourg's contributions have 
increased and said that he believed the figure for 2008 would 
"not be less than that of this year."  Thill could not 
provide any insight to what, if any, portion of this amount 
might be direct budgetary assistance to the Palestinian 
Authority.
