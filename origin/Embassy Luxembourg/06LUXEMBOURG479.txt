¶1. (U) Post delivered talking points contained reftel to the 
MFA's Directorates of Political Affairs, International 
Economic Affairs, and Cooperation and Development.  The GOL 
has informed Post that Luxembourg has committed a total of 
900,000 euros (1.14 million USD) for Lebanon to be divided 
among humanitarian assistance, de-mining activities, and an 
NGO. 
 
¶2. (U) This assistance is to be divided as follows (all figures 
in euros):  750,000 towards direct humanitarian assistance, 
100,000 to the UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS) for de-mining 
activities in Lebanon, and 50,000 to Caritas for humanitarian 
assistance to be conducted through a Lebanese counterpart. 
The GOL claims that at roughly 2 euros per person (2005 
estimated population of 455,000), the 900,000 euros committed 
to Lebanon makes Luxembourg the largest donor per capita by 
quote "a very wide margin" at the moment. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  While Post is not in a position to verify 
the veracity of the GOL's claim as the top Lebanon donor per 
capita, Luxembourg continues to be quite prod of its status 
as a world leader in net official development assistance on a 
per capita basis.
