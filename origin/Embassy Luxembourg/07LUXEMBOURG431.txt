appropriate Government of Luxembourg officials at 1600 local

Muller, MFA Deputy Political Director.  Muller noted the 
demarche points and reminded Post of Luxembourg's position 
regarding sanctions - that Luxembourg was fully supportive of 
the P5 1's efforts and hoped that a 3rd round of sanctions 
would not be necessary.  Muller promised to provide any 
additional reaction after the MFA had time to review the 
demarche in coordination with other appropriate GOL offcials.
