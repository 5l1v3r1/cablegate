¶1. (U) Subsequent to Ref B, Post received a letter from EIB 
President Philippe Maystadt indicating that "the European 
Council has not conferred an official mandate to the EIB to 
operate in Iraq and for this reason we will therefore not be 
represented at the forthcoming Ministerial meeting." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Stephane Viallon, assistant to EIB Vice President 
Philippe De Fontaine Vive, confirmed to Econoff that EIB had 
sought and received permission from the EU Commission to 
include an EIB staff member as part of the Commission's 
delegation attending the signing ceremony, but only in an 
"observer" status.
