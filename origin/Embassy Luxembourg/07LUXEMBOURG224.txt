SUBJECT: LUXEMBOURG STRONGLY FAVORABLE TO OPEN-END MEETING 
ON UNSCR 1737 AND 1747 
 
REF: STATE 69283 
 
(SBU) The MFA advised post on 29 May that Luxembourg was 
"strongly favorable" towards the open-ended meeting proposed 
by the U.S. and would attend "if staffing permitted." 
Luxembourg understands that due to the opposition of some 
members, these matters could not be discussed within the 
framework of the NSG.  However, Luxembourg thought this was 
unfortunate since regarding matters of nuclear proliferation 
and in particular, UN Security Resolutions, the countries of 
the NSG had a responsibility to speak on the issue as the 
suppliers of nuclear material.
