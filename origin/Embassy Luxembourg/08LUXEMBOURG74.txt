SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR WAGNER WARNS BANKERS ABOUT THE RISKS OF DOING 
BUSINESS WITH IRAN 
 
¶1. (U) During a March 14 speech to the International Bankers Club of 
Luxembourg, the Ambassador discussed the USG position and policy on 
Iran sanctions.  She reviewed the operations of the Treasury 
Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and emphasized 
the reputational risk of doing business with Iran, citing several 
large international banks that have already stopped doing business 
with Iranian entities. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: The International Bankers Club includes several 
dozen of the most senior bankers and financial executives in 
Luxembourg, which remains one of the most important financial 
centers in the world.  Her remarks were very well received, and 
following the speech the Ambassador was approached by a banker who 
requested assistance in assuring that his bank's operations comply 
with the sanctions policy.  Post will actively follow up this 
request. End Comment.
