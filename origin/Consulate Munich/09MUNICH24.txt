¶1. (SBU) Afghanistan was a primary focus of the February 6-8 Munich 
Security Conference (MSC). Criticism of Afghan President Karzai was a 
major theme in the statements and questions of conference 
participants.  For his part, Karzai put a positive spin on 
developments in Afghanistan and ascribed the remaining challenges to 
shortcomings in Western engagement.  In his remarks to the conference 
and in subsequent media interviews, Karzai criticized the West for 
civilian casualties and inadequate development and civilian 
assistance.  Many conference participants spoke out in favor of a 
stronger regional approach, and several suggested that more troops 
were needed on the ground.  Special Representative Holbrooke was 
widely quoted as saying that the challenges in Afghanistan were "much 
tougher than in Iraq."  At a pre-conference event for German and 
American participants (held under Chatham House rules), the focus was 
also on Afghanistan.  The discussion was somber, with a clear 
recognition of negative developments and the significant challenges 
facing the international community. End Summary. 
 
Karzai Lauds Progress but Criticizes West 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) At the MSC meeting devoted to Afghanistan, President Karzai 
opened his remarks by recounting the successes in Afghanistan since 
the fall of the Taliban, including expanded transportation, 
educational, and health care opportunities.  A large part of the 
vision for Afghanistan had already been achieved, he asserted.  He 
argued that it was outsiders who had destroyed Afghanistan and 
therefore the international community had a moral responsibility to 
assist in Afghanistan's reconstruction.  Karzai argued that the 
international community had not moved swiftly enough after 2001 to 
support Afghanistan, and this presented an opportunity for the 
Taliban to regroup and threaten peace and stability in Afghanistan 
today. 
 
¶3. (U) Karzai argued that Afghanistan was not a "narco-state" because 
the Afghan state did not receive revenues from the drug economy. 
Karzai predicted a decline of 20-30 percent in poppy production this 
year.  Asked about alternative livelihoods to poppy production, he 
reported that cultivation of roses and fruits were options but he 
added that the most important component in combating counternarcotics 
was to give Afghans "confidence for their future."  On corruption, 
Karzai reported that the issue is being worked on, but he offered no 
substantive policies or goals. 
 
REGIONAL APPROACH REQUIRED 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Welcoming a regional approach to the Afghanistan  problem, 
Karzai said that Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan are all faced "with 
the same struggle," and needed to work together along with China and 
Russia to fight terrorism. Special Representative Holbrooke described 
the situation as a "long, difficult struggle."  He emphasized that 
Afghanistan and Pakistan had many common problems that could only be 
solved together. 
 
COORDINATION MUST IMPROVE 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Karzai strongly criticized the lack of international 
coordination as one of the reasons why reconstruction efforts have 
been showing little progress.  National Security Advisor General 
Jones said "we cannot afford failure in Afghanistan" and suggested 
that past efforts Afghanistan had been too focused on military 
security.  Germany's DefMin Jung complained that it took until 2008 
for NATO to approve a joint strategy for Afghanistan, even though 
NATO had been leading the ISAF operation since 2003. 
 
ADDITIONAL TROOPS NEEDED? 
------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) German Defense Minister Jung argued that troop levels in 
Afghanistan were sufficient, because according to a joint assessment 
with the Afghan government there were only 1500 violent insurgents in 
Afghanistan.  On the other hand, non-German participants on the stage 
stressed the need for more combat troops.  UK's DefMin John Hutton 
 
MUNICH 00000024  002 OF 002 
 
 
expected the additional U.S. forces to have a positive effect, but 
emphasized that the Alliance needed to deliver on the reconstruction 
side.  Hutton stressed that "we are kidding ourselves if we think" 
that troops other than combat troops are necessary now.  Sikorski 
chimed in to say (as he has in previous years at the MSC) that "one 
who gives without caveats gives twice."  Canadian Defense Minister 
Peter MacKay also welcomed additional troops.  He recommended using 
the "common sense approach" instead of the "comprehensive approach," 
which includes networked security and a regional approach.  He also 
suggested tapping other countries' resources for more reconstruction 
assistance.  Finally, NATO Secretary General de Hoop Scheffer called 
on NATO allies to consider providing additional resources to the 
Afghanistan mission.
