DEVELOPMENT GRANT AWARD FDA-936-07 
 
REF: SECSTATE 133848 
 
¶1.  Consulate General Munich is unaware of any information that 
would present negative foreign policy implications in connection 
with awarding a product development grant award to either the 
Medizinische Universitatsklinik Wurzburg or the Klinikum der 
Universitat Munchen, and thus has no objections to awarding a grant 
to either institution. 
 
¶2.  This report has been coordinated with Embassy Berlin. 
 
¶3.  Previous reporting from Munich is available on our SIPRNET 
website at www.state.sgov.gov/p/eur/munich/ .
