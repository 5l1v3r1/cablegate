¶1. (SBU) During an April 11 telephone call to Foreign 
Minister Joao Miranda, Ambassador Mozena expressed U.S. 
support for the SADC initiative in regard to the Zimbabwe 
situation, which President Dos Santos, as Chair of the SADC 
Organ for Politics, Defense, and Security, helped President 
Mwanawassa launch.  The Ambassador told Miranda that SADC can 
play a vital and constructive role to ensure that the will of 
the Zimbabwe people, who voted almost two weeks ago, is 
realized.  The Ambassador said the international community is 
looking to the region and watching how SADC leaders respond 
in defense of democracy.  The Ambassador added that the U.S. 
hoped violence can be avoided in Zimbabwe. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Miranda took the points on board and said he would 
convey them to the President.  He said he and the President 
would depart either today or tomorrow morning for Lusaka, 
leaving on Sunday.  Miranda said he would reach out to the 
Ambassador the week of his return from New York, where he 
will participate in a meeting of the UN Security Council on 
African issues, called by the South Africans in their role as 
Chair of the UNSC. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: The GRA is playing its cards close to its 
vest.  Urgent, but quiet diplomacy is ongoing in the region, 
but the media here has been silent on Angola's role at the 
SADC meeting... and Miranda wasn't tipping his hand to the 
Ambassador.  Angola's action (or inaction) at the SADC summit 
will reveal much about the depth of Angola's commitment to 
democracy.
