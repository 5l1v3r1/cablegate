¶1. (SBU) President Eduardo dos Santos and Foreign 
Minister Joao Bernardo de Miranda publicly rejected the 
possibility of Angolan military support for the Somali 
peacekeeping force following a meeting of the Council of 
Ministers on January 19, 2007.  President dos Santos stated 
that Angolan military forces are currently needed for 
internal reconstruction, and that sending troops on foreign 
missions would disrupt national reconstruction and 
development plans already in place. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The possibility of Angolan military participation 
sparked intense internal debate, in which a think tank of 
retired military officers called the timing inopportune and 
expressed concerns about the logistical problems associated 
with a long-term deployment.  FM Miranda did, however, 
express solidarity with those working for peace, stability, 
and self-determination in Africa, and the door was left open 
to other types of Angolan support for the peacekeeping 
effort.  The GRA plans to send a delegation to the upcoming 
African Union summit to discuss these issues in greater 
detail.
