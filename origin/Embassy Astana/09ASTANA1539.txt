¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  On September 12, President Nazarbayev hosted the 
presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan at a private 
resort in Kenderliy, south of the port city of Aktau in western 
Kazakhstan.  According to press reports and interviews with 
government officials and resident diplomats, the presidents 
discussed economic, energy, environmental, and boundary issues.  No 
documents were signed and no declaration was issued following the 
informal summit.  The presidents stressed that they had not 
conferred on the delimitation of the Caspian Sea, and would not do 
so until all five Caspian littoral states, including Iran, have an 
opportunity to discuss the issue, possibly in Baku later this year. 
The meeting supposedly allowed Nazarbayev to play the role of 
gracious host and honest broker against the backdrop of tension 
between Turkmenistan and Russia over gas shipments, and between 
Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan over boundary issues.  It also 
underscored Russia's continuing desire to influence economic and 
energy policy in the Caspian, particularly regarding the 
transportation of oil and gas.  END SUMMARY. 
 
AKTAU ATMOSPHERICS 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The September 12 informal summit brought together the 
presidents of Kazakhstan, Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan in 
Kazakhstan for the first time, and the port city of Aktau was well 
dressed for the occasion.  Several local residents told Energy 
Officer on September 13 that before the presidents' arrival, all of 
the city's roads had been resurfaced, new landscaping was installed, 
and dozens of billboards were erected to highlight Nazarbayev's 
steady leadership, promote the capital city of Astana, and welcome 
the distinguished visitors.  Nazarbayev also opened a new airport 
terminal and trading center during his visit.  For security reasons, 
the port of Aktau was closed for five days, while empty oil tankers 
waited offshore, unable to load their cargo.  An American oil 
company executive based in Aktau told Energy Officer on September 13 
that the local government commandeered vehicles -- and their drivers 
-- from international companies working in Aktau to support the 
summit.  "This was not a polite request," he said.  "They basically 
ordered us to give up a couple cars for ten days, and they had our 
drivers on call the whole time, 24/7." 
 
MEDVEDEV'S SPEECH SETS THE STAGE 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Russian President Medvedev set the stage for the Caspian 
Sea Summit with his August 17 speech in Astrakhan.  In the speech, 
Medvedev acknowledged "the Caspian Sea's mineral resources enormous 
significance" to global energy security, but said Russia's main goal 
was "to preserve the Caspian Sea for future generations, not 
allowing it to be spoiled" by oil and gas exploration.  Medvedev 
also called for "active talks" to define the legal status of the 
Caspian Sea, announced Russia's interest in developing Caspian 
maritime transportation infrastructure, endorsed the creation of the 
Caspian Sea Economic Cooperation Organization, and confirmed 
Russia's strong desire to convene a meeting of experts in Baku "to 
develop a pentalateral agreement on security cooperation in the 
Caspian Sea."  The next day, the office of President Nazarbayev 
announced that Kazakhstan would host the leaders of Russia, 
Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan at Kenderliy.  The informal summit was 
on, and diplomats across the region hurriedly began to prepare their 
principals.  During a September 10 reception in Astana, a Russian 
Embassy Political Officer told PolOff that his Embassy was 
essentially empty, with most staff in Aktau to prepare for the 
Caspian Sea Summit.  The Russian Embassy also suspended 
non-emergency consular services, due to the deployment of the 
Consular Officer to Aktau. 
 
HIGH-STAKES GAS GAMES AT ORENBURG 
 
¶5.  (SBU) On September 11, on the eve of the Caspian Sea Summit, 
Russian President Medvedev met President Nazarbayev in Orenburg for 
the sixth annual Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum. 
 
ASTANA 00001539  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
According to press reports, Medvedev and Nazarbayev discussed border 
security, immigration, and energy cooperation.  Specifically, they 
spoke about oil and gas exploration in Kazakhstan, the 
transportation of oil and gas via Russia, and expansion of the 
combined heat and power plant Ekibastuz-2 in eastern Kazakhstan.  On 
September 10, Todd Levy, General Director of Tengizchevroil (TCO), 
called Energy Officer to say that Russia had suddenly stopped 
receiving natural gas exports from Kazakhstan.  As a result, TCO 
reduced its production of oil at Tengiz, and considered flaring 
natural gas far in excess of agreed-upon limits.  Levy said that if 
gas flows to Russia did not resume quickly, TCO would have to 
severely curtail production, which could cost the company up to $2 
billion in lost revenue in 2009.  Levy flew to Orenburg and raised 
the issue with Minister of Energy and Minister Resources Sauat 
Mynbayev, who discussed it with Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller. 
According to Levy, on September 11, Miller agreed to allow dry gas 
shipments from TCO to Russia to resume for six days, during which 
negotiations would continue on a long-term sales contract.  (NOTE: 
TCO was expected to export up to five billion cubic meters of gas to 
Russia in 2009, through a 50-50 joint venture between KazRosGaz and 
Invest Gas Limited.  TCO has not received confirmation that Invest 
Gas Limited has a permit for transportation via Russia.  END NOTE). 
 
WHAT WAS DISCUSSED AT AKTAU? 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Reports of what the presidents discussed and agreed during 
their informal summit are sketchy and speculative.  On August 21, 
Campbell Keir, Country Manager for Shell Kazakhstan, told the 
Ambassador that he and other international energy executives had 
been summoned to Aktau to brief Nazarbayev on energy issues before 
the Caspian Sea Summit.  However, days before the summit, Nazarbayev 
abruptly postponed the energy briefing until the end of September, 
leading Keir and others to speculate that the presidents would not 
be discussing oil and gas issues in great detail.  Keir noted that 
the four presidents have much to talk about in addition to 
delimitation and oil transportation, including vessel flagging, 
sturgeon conservation, oil spill response, and leaking sunken ships 
in the Caspian. 
 
LIMITED PRESS COVERAGE 
 
¶7.  (SBU) On September 12, the local newspaper in Aktau, "Mangistau 
Ogniy" (Fires of Mangistau), quoted Nazarbayev saying that "global 
and strategic issues" would not be discussed at the summit, since 
these would require the presence of all five Caspian littoral 
states, including Iran.  "Nevertheless," said Nazarbayev, "our four 
countries have something to talk about" in an informal and relaxed 
setting.  According to the article, Russian President Medvedev said, 
"although our economies are showing signs of growth, we should not 
become complacent.  We all need to reconstruct our financial 
systems, and discuss solutions to achieve economic growth."  Azeri 
President Aliyev confirmed that Azerbaijan would host the next 
Caspian summit in Baku and emphasized that all five Caspian states 
will be invited "to discuss global issues and take concrete 
decisions" about the status of the Caspian Sea.  (NOTE:  An 
accompanying photograph of the four presidents showed Medvedev and 
Nazarbayev smiling broadly and standing shoulder to shoulder, while 
Aliyev and Berdimukhamedov flank them awkwardly, some distance away. 
 The paper also published full-page profiles of Kazakhstan's 
relations with Russia ("Friendship Forever"), Azerbaijan ("Country 
of Fire"), and Turkmenistan ("The Dialogue Continues").  END NOTE). 
 
EVEN INSIDERS WERE ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN 
 
¶8.  (SBU) On September 15, a senior political advisor to the 
governor of Mangistau oblast told the Ambassador that the Caspian 
Sea Summit was poorly organized and "improvised."  He said the 
agenda was "not well prepared" and confirmed that no documents were 
signed during the Summit.  He also said that President Nazarbayev 
traveled to Turkmenbashi, Turkmenistan, on September 13 with Russian 
President Medvedev.  An Azeri diplomat in Astana told Energy Officer 
on September 15 that, while he had no first-hand knowledge of what 
 
ASTANA 00001539  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
was discussed at the summit, he understood that the presidents 
discussed oil and gas transportation, as well as the delimitation of 
the Caspian Sea.  He speculated that the presidents wanted to 
"define a common position" on the issue, before all five Caspian Sea 
littoral states convene in Baku, "later this year." 
 
IRAN IRATE 
 
¶9.  (SBU) On September 9, in a meeting with Kazakhstan's new 
ambassador to Iran, Iranian Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki said 
that the informal Caspian Sea Summit "runs contrary to Iran's 
national interests."  According to wire reports, he said the meeting 
"violates previous agreements, in which the five Caspian littoral 
states came to the understanding that any decision on the waterway 
should be made with the participation of all its neighboring 
countries."  Following the summit, the presidents of Russia, 
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan all issued similar 
statements, confirming that the status of the Caspian Sea could only 
be determined with the presence and participation of all five 
Caspian littoral countries.  According to Interfax, Medvedev said, 
"I believe that resolution of the Caspian issue requires serious 
discussion among all of the states that border the Caspian."  He 
added that such a discussion would take place in the near future, in 
Baku. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Hosting the summit showed Kazakhstan's 
interest, desire, and willingness to play the role of facilitator, 
honest broker, and balancer of interests among the other countries 
in the region.  The summit also revealed Russia's continued desire 
to influence the policies of the other former Soviet states in the 
region, in order to maintain Russian control over the transportation 
of oil and gas from the Caspian.  We have no way of knowing if 
Russia used the summit to exert direct pressure on the other 
countries to cease specific projects such as the Kazakhstan Caspian 
Transportation System, but it the summit did provide Medvedev an 
opportunity, in a relaxed setting "among friends," to lobby for 
increased oil and gas shipments through Russia.  END COMMENT.
