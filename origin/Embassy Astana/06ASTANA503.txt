¶1. (U) Pol Chief and Poloff delivered reftel demarches to Murat 
Tashibayev, director of the MFA's Department of International 
Organizations and Security Issues, on November 7. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Tashibayev concurred that Kazakhstan and the U.S. would be 
most likely to find common ground on the resolutions dealing with 
Iran, Burma, and the DPRK.  The annual Cuba resolution is always 
tricky for Kazakhstan, he noted, due to the former USSR's ties with 
Cuba.  Tashibayev said that he would brief Deputy Foreign Minister 
Abdrakhmanov on the U.S. position, but did not make any commitments 
as to how his government would vote.
