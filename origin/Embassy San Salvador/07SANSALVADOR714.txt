(SBU) Poloff delivered U.S. nonpaper on April 13 to Mario 
Rivera, Head of Multilateral Affairs and Milton Magana, Head 
of Asian Affairs at the Salvadoran MFA.  They reported that 
they did not believe any financial institutions in El 
Salvador have a relationship with Iran's Defense Industries 
Organization, but that they would pass the information 
through the proper channels of El Salvador's National 
Security Council so that all pertinent regulatory authorities 
are aware of the U.S. designation.
