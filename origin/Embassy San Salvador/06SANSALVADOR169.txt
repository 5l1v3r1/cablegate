On January 23, Poloff met with Jose Francisco Gonzalez 
Cortez, Security and Defense Officer of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, regarding the Framework Treaty on Democratic 
Security in Central America.  Gonzalez explained that he had 
been one of the original drafters of the Framework Treaty, 
and that he likewise believed in the importance of all the 
Central American countries ratifying the Treaty.  He stated 
that because issues such as gangs, narco-trafficking, 
corruption, and arms control are so important for the 
stability of the region, it was essential for Costa Rica and 
Panama to ratify the Treaty so they could assume greater 
responsibility.  Gonzalez further added that the drafters of 
the treaty took into account that Costa Rica and Panama did 
not have standing armies, but that ten years ago when the 
presidents arrived to sign the document, they worried about 
some of the provisions.  He welcomed the United States' 
renewed efforts to encourage Costa Rica and Panama to ratify 
the document and participate more fully in regional security 
efforts.
