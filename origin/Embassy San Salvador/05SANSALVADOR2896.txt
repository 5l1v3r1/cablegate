SUBJECT: REPATRIATION REQUEST FOR COLONEL REYES, SALVADORAN 
MILITARY OFFICER HOSPITALIZED AT BROOK ARMY MEDICAL 
CENTER, TX 
 
¶1.  (U) Col Juan Hector Reyes was granted Secretary of 
the Army Designee Status on 21 Oct 05.  Col Reyes arrived 
Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) via U.S. sponsored MEDEVAC 
on or about 22 2000L Oct 2005. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Col Reyes is currently in a comatose state and 
BAMC Doctors report Col Reyes condition to be terminal, 
consistent with brain death, with an unlikely probability 
of recovery. BAMC Doctors report Col Reyes will likely pass 
away in the near future, even while connected to life support 
equipment. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) In the event Col Reyes passes, I request repatriation 
of his remains back to El Salvador via the most expeditious 
means possible. Expeditious return will enable the Government 
of El Salvador to prepare the remains for burial locally. 
 
¶4. (U) I also request authorization for the spouse, Mrs. Ana 
Evelyn Reyes, to accompany remains to El Salvador.  Mrs. Reyes 
accompanied her husband to BAMC on the sponsored MEDEVAC. 
 
¶5. (U) I strongly recommend U.S. government concurrence with 
this request.
