(SBU)  On May 31, poloff again raised points in reftels A and 
B, regarding the USG position on UNSCR 1747, with MFA Chief 
of Multilateral Affairs Mario Rivera.  Poloff urged Rivera to 
ensure that the GOES submits their report to the 1747 
Sanctions Committee.  Rivera acknowledged that the GOES 
should have done this by now, but said the MFA was still 
waiting for input from the Ministries of Defense and Public 
Security before they could make their report, which he hoped 
would be soon.  Poloff shared the U.S. report contained in 
reftel B, and Rivera promised they would study the USG 
position carefully.  Poloff also raised reftel A points about 
a broad definition of arms for UNSCR 1747.  Rivera did not 
have an immediate reaction to this, saying only that in 
general terms, the GOES supports sanctions against Iran, and 
is worried about their noncompliance.  He promised to study 
the issue in greater detail and present this position to the 
Salvadoran Ministry of Defense as well.  Post will continue 
to follow up and report any updates on the GOES position 
septel.
