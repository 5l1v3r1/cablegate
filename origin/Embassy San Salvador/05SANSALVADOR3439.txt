SUBJECT: CAFTA-DR ENTRY INTO FORCE 

Classified By: Ambassador H. Douglas Barclay. Reason:  1.4 (d)

 

 ¶1. (C) I think it is critical that El Salvador's successful

efforts to meet CAFTA-DR requirements be recognized by

entry-into-force of the agreement on January 1.  Observing

this deadline will acknowledge the efforts of the Saca

Government (as well as neighboring governments who cross the

finish line) to complete preparations for CAFTA, while

maintaining momentum for the President's free-trade program

here in the region and elsewhere in the Americas.  We should

use the offer of a certain January 1 entry into force date to

secure commitments on final outstanding issues but not let

technical details get in the way of our larger goals.  Just

as we ask for El Salvador to show leadership in making the

changes important for CAFTA, so should the United States

continue to show the leadership that is so important now.

January 1 entry into force would have the specific advantage

of forcing other CAFTA signatories to accelerate and complete

legislation that ensures compliance with their commitments

under the treaty.  They will not want to be on the outside

looking in.

 

¶2. (C) Saca's El Salvador is a beacon of pro-Americanism in a

region vulnerable to internal and external pressures contrary

to U.S. interests.  His outspoken support of the FTAA concept

and El Salvador's contribution of troops to Iraq have been of

great importance to us.  The principal concrete benefit to El

Salvador of Saca's support for US policy has been the trade

benefits of CAFTA.  We would be making a mistake by delaying

these benefits just as the friendliest government in the

region launches its campaign for the March 2006 elections.
