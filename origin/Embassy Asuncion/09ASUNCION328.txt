(U) This cable responds to ref A action request.  Paraguay's 
bilateral relationship with Cuba has not changed 
substantially since last reporting (ref B).  President 
Fernando Lugo met Cuban President Raul Castro during the 
April 14-15 Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas Summit in 
Caracas.  Lugo will visit Cuba June 3-4 for bilateral 
meetings; his stated purpose is to "strengthen ties of 
cooperation and friendship in health, education, and 
culture."  In the past six months, high-level Paraguayan 
officials have reaffirmed solidarity with Cuba and opposed 
the U.S. embargo on Cuba.
