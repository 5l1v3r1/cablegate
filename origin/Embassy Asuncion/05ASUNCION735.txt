¶1.  On 6/2, Julio Peralta, MFA's Director for International 
Organizations, signaled to polcouns Paraguay was leaning 
towards supporting Cuba's candidacy for the ILO Governing 
Body.  He advised that Cuba had weighed in early and often 
pushing its candidacy.  Further, Paraguay felt compelled to 
take into consideration humanitarian assistance Cuba provided 
to Paraguay.  (Note. Cuba provides medical scholarships for 
young Paraguayans to study in Cuba.  Recently, Cuba offered 
to fly Paraguayans afflicted with serious sight problems to 
Cuba for free medical treatment. End Note.)  Finally, Peralta 
noted that two union officials were traveling as part of 
Paraguay's delegation to the meeting in Geneva where the vote 
would take place and that they both supported Cuba's 
candidacy.  Meanwhile, Barbados had not approached Paraguay 
formally to seek support for its candidacy. 
 
¶2.  Polcouns urged Paraguay to base its decision on the 
merits of the candidates.  Barbados had a respectable record 
on labor issues; Cuba's record was an international travesty. 
Peralta maintained GOP had not made a formal decision yet. 
It was still waiting to see if Barbados would approach 
Paraguay in Geneva on the matter.  Ultimately, Paraguay's 
decision would be made on the ground by its Mission in 
Geneva, in consultation as appropriate with the FM.
