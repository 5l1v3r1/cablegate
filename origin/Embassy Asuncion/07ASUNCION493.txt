PolOff delivered message to Terumi Matsuo, the MFA's Director 
for International Organizations, June 11.  Matsuo told PolOff 
that he would pass the message forward to her superiors and 
to Paraguay's UN Mission.  In the past, Paraguay has signaled 
it shares our concerns about Iran's non-compliance with its 
international obligations.  It has rebuffed a series of 
Iranian overtures to develop commercial relations.  Post will 
report any further substantive response septel.
