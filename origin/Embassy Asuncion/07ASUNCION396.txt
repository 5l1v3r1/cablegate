SUBJECT: COM CONFERENCE: A SOUTHERN CONE PERSPECTIVE ON CHAVEZ'S INFLUENCE REF: A. 06 ASUNCION 0709  B. BRASILIA 0708  C. STATE 66324 "Classified By: DCM MICHAEL J. FITZPATRICK; Reasons 1.4(b),(d) "
 Â¶1. (C) SUMMARY: During May 8-9 Southern Cone / Brazil COM 
"Conference in Rio de Janiero, the five Southern Cone "Ambassadors discussed aggressive plans of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez to create a unified Bolivarian movement throughout "Latin America, particularly focusing on activities within "their respective countries.  This report is the product of observations and analyses provided by all these posts. 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is aggressively seeking to "divide Latin America between those who buy into his populist, "anti-American policies and authoritarian message and those "who seek to establish and strengthen free-market, democratic ""based policies and institutions.  In the Southern Cone, "Chavez is working to win adherents to his camp through what appears to be a multi-faceted plan that relies heavily on his ability to offer energy and grandiose (and graft-inspiring) petrodollar-based projects.  Some regional leaders and some "of the region,s dispossessed may find the rhetoric ""attractive but many more seem willing to take Chavez,s money "while paying only lip service to his politics.  And still 
others in the region find him frankly distasteful. In the "end, however, Chavez shouldn,t be underestimated.  Money ""talks, democratic institutions in the region are still weak, "and free market economics have yet to provide consistent "solutions to the Southern Cone,s social and political ills. "Septel will offer our posts' collective views about how to best address the threat this campaign represents to U.S. "interests, but it is clear we need more (and more flexible) "
resources and tools to counter Chavez's efforts to assume greater dominion over Latin America at the expense of U.S. leadership and interests.  END SUMMARY.  THE PLAYBOOK ------------ 2. (C)  The Venezuelan Embassy in 2006 outlined in detail its strategy for Paraguay in a document somewhat like our MSP. This playbook articulates the following as Venezuela's principal political and economic goals for the region:  #NAME?#NAME?-- Strengthen Venezuela's Position in the International Economy #NAME?#NAME?
 "While the terms are rather grandiose and nebulous, writ large "they reinforce Chavez' desire to transform the playing field in Latin America positioning Venezuela at the lead.  POLITICAL EFFORTS TO DISRUPT DEMOCRACY -------------------------------------- 3. (S/NF) Chavez has engaged political leaders of countries in the region promoting his vision for the region under the "banner of """"Latin American Solidarity and Integration"""" as part "of a campaign that invests a high premium in personal contact.  He has also taken pains to engage local populations to foster his image as the standard bearer for the "common-person, often times extending generous aid for social ""projects, and painting an image of the U.S. as elitist and "
"favoring only big business.  Meanwhile, clandestinely, theVenezuelan Government has provided money and material support to Bolivarian and sympathetic leftist groups through its embassies in the region often as part of a campaign to expand "influence, including in the results of key elections. " #NAME?"political leaders and organizations, some of which have close "ties to President Kirchner.  Kirchner presently sees little "downside to maintaining a close relationship with Chavez, ""particularly in an election year, since Chavez remains "
relatively popular in Argentina -- 52 percent of Argentines viewed Chavez favorably in December 2006 -- and the U.S. is not.  Kirchner has attempted to distance himself publicly from Chavez's anti-U.S. position and has tried to maintain the perception of a more independent line to meet mainstream "voter approval, but his economic strategy clearly envisions "closer commercial and financial ties with Chavez and positioning himself between Chavez and Lula on the regional "political spectrum.  At the same time, Kirchner seeks to "balance his relationship with Chavez.  This is evident in the 
support Kirchner and his wife have shown for Venezuela's "Jewish community, while he has refrained from any public ""calls in support of press freedom or RCTV, for example. " #NAME?present in all of Bolivia's nine departments and are active "in many, if not all, sectors of the Bolivian government.  The "Morales Government frequently consults with  Chavez and their "relationship runs deep.  Venezuelan Ambassador to Bolivia, ""Julio Montes, publicly pledged in October 2006, """"Venezuelan "blood will be shed if the Bolivian revolution were "threatened."""" "#NAME?"course of the past year, and Chavez is unpopular in both the ""political class (politicians, journalists) and with the "general public.  Chavez is increasingly seen here as an 
"emerging rival to Lula for regional leadership, and a threat ""to the kind of integrated, progressive and outward-looking "South America that successive Brazilian governments have "sought to encourage. Against this negative backdrop, Lula has "performed an awkward balancing act: publicly supporting Chavez's re-election and touting the benefits of economic "integration with Venezuela, while privately seething with "frustration at Chavez's unpredictable behavior and rhetorical "grandstanding.  It appears Lula will continue in this mode, "
and he seems prepared to let political criticism of his role vis-a-vis Chavez roll off his back. This is because of both traditional Brazilian foreign policy priorities with Venezuela and some residual ideological sympathy among Lula and his inner circle for Chavez's fading socialist-populist image. #NAME?"Bolivarian revolution.""""  But Chilean leaders recognize that "Chavez is aggressive and that he bears close watch.  Chilean Army Intelligence (DINE) reports that the Venezuelan Embassy is funding Bolivarian and leftist groups.While President Bachelet is a socialist with a certain ideological sympathy 
"for Chavez, she is a also a pragmatist who recognizes that "Chile's successful free market economic policies and stable democratic political model is preferable to what Chavez "offers.  As a result, Chile will continue to quietly promote ""its own model, although Bachelet will not likely challenge "Chavez openly. -- Many Paraguayan leaders (both from the opposition and the ruling Colorado Party) are suspicious of Chavez's motives and "voice concern about his """"interference into internal ""politics.""""  The Venezuelan agreement with Bolivia to "strengthen Bolivia's military adds to the concerns.  At the "same, Presidet Duarte, has tilted leftward in his rhetoric "
and applauded Chavez' vision over the last two months.  He isseeking to fend off the challenge posed to Colorado control of the government in the 2008 election by leftist priest Fernando Lugo who is leading the polls.  While Lugo's "campaign evinces little evidence of significant funding, it "has been alleged that he has been offered assistance by the Venezuela Embassy on orders from Chavez and has signaled interest in receiving funds.  Several small mostly student or social interest based groups in Paraguay receive financial 
and material support from Venezuela but presently register little influence on the political scene; local municipal officials have told emboffs that Venezuela has provided peasant leaders training in leading social movements. Venezuela has funded flights for hundreds of poor Paraguayans to fly to Cuba for eye surgery and Venezuela appears to be "winning converts at the mass levels, while the elites are "increasingly nervous. "-- In Uruguay, Venezuela's influence is growing but is not "yet great. Chavez was most active and visible on the eve of "Venezuela's entry into Mercosur, but soon after his interest "seemed to have waned.  Some officials privately snicker at "his antics behind his back.  In public, though, they are "happy to congratulate Chavez and take advantage of any economic benefits (especially oil) that he is willing to "bestow.  For example, Chavez donated USD 20 million for a "cancer center at a local public hospital. (President Vazquez is an oncologist so the donation seemed especially aimed at pleasing him.)  Chavez has also invested in failing companies and financial institutions. ECONOMIC STRATEGIES TO STRANGLE FREE TRADE ------------------------- 4. (U) Chavez uses his petrodollars to advance economic and political objectives in the region.  He has aggressively pursued energy agreements in exchange for support of political objectives including Venezuela admission into "Mercosur and the creation of Bancosur.  In the process, he "has contributed to an increased politicization of Mercosur and shored up resistance to ALCA. -- In Argentina, though Kirchner shares some of Chavez's ""leftist perspective, he is primarily a pragmatist; his "affable ties with Caracas are driven more by Venezuela's "attractive offers of high-profile investments, placement of "GoA sovereign debt (USD 4.2 billion to date), loans to "Argentine national companies  and trade deals than by ideological affinity.  In return for Chavez's economic "largesse, Kirchner supported Venezuela's failed bid for a UN ""Security Council seat, its early entry into Mercosur and "allowed him to stage an anti-Bush rally on March 9.  "-- In Bolivia, Venezuela spent USD 195 million on Bolivian "
"products, mostly soy, in 2006.  In April 2006, Bolivia signed ""onto the Bolivarian Alternative for America (ALBA), an ""agreement with Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Ecuador, under "which Venezuela has pledged at least USD 200 million in "support of a national development bank, development projects, "and financial assistance. 
 #NAME?terms.  Brazil has been running sustained current account 
"surpluses, which have allowed it to pay down external debt ""and build up foreign reserves. However, Venezuela and ""Bolivia's championing of a Bank of the South, an idea ""resisted by Brazil, is starting to create demarcations within ""South America, something that will work against Brazilian "integration plans.  Chavez's obsession with opposing the U.S.-Brazil partnership on biofuels pushed President Lula for the first time to lay down a red line with respect to Chavez. (ref. B) -- Venezuela's direct foreign investment in Chile is tiny, ""little more than USD 100,000 between 1995 and-2000. "
"Chile-Venezuela bilateral trade is also fairly small, "representing less than 10 percent of Chile's trade with Latin America. There has been discussion in the press of an alliance between the Chilean oil company ENAP and Petrolera Venezolana (PDVSA) but nothing has been finalized.  Earlier this year the head of ENP said publicly that Venezuela was "not in Chile's plans for 2007.  That said, many Chileans ""expect that, given Chile's precarious energy situation, "
Chavez could eventually use oil to foster greater sympathy "for his political agenda.   However, opinion polling in "January suggested that eight-in-ten Chileans had heard something of what Chavez has been saying and doing vis--vis "Chile.  Among those, 77 percent rejected his conduct and 81 ""percent believed Chavez,s motivation was self promotion. " #NAME?17.  Under the agreement which has come under harsh attack by Paraguay's conservative business community and which still "must be approved by the Congress, Venezuela's PDVSA would "invest an astounding (for Paraguay) USD 600 million to modernize Petropar's oil refinery. The modernization project is expected to bring the refinery's capacity up to about "35,000 barrels per day (bpd).  This is hardly cost-effective "strictly speaking as the smallest refinery in neighboring "Argentina has a capacity of approximately 120,000 bpd.  But, ""it offers current leaders plenty of """"grease.""""  Venezuela has "offered to help Paraguay prospect for gas in the western part "of Paraguay.  In addition, Paraguay is considering joining "the Venezuelan Bancosur project. -- Uruguay's President Vazquez plays to centrists in his "economic policy, so Chavez's economic populism will likely ""not take root in Uruguay.  At the same time, Uruguay has a "heavy debt burden and no known hydrocarbon deposits.  As "such, Venezuelan oil and money could prove tempting as part "of a bid to boost the economy. Venezuela's PDVSA has invited Uruguay's state oil company ANCAP to prospect for oil in Uruguay and in Venezuela and to associate itself with ANCAP's refinery through a USD 600 million investment. 
MERCOSUR: THE TAIL WAGGING THE DOG?-------------------------  5. (C) The entry of Venezuela into Mercosur clearly altered the power balance and dynamics of the organization.  Mercosur has increasingly devolved from an imperfect customs union into a more restrictive and anti-American political organization.  A prime example of Mercosur's unflinching support for Venezuela was demonstrated on the UNSC 
semi-permanent seat bid.  After more than 50 successive "votes, Mercosur members continued to support Venezuela's "candidacy.  Mercosur solidarity held fast until Uruguay was mentioned as a possible compromise candidate. Argentina is said to have vetoed the move and Brazil was reportedly not supportive of Uruguay either.  On numerous occasions Paraguayan and Uruguayan MFA officials have signaled that they must consult closely with their Mercosur partners on key matters relating to foreign policy. 6. (C) It is widely believed in Uruguay that the inspiration for Brazil's supporting Venezuela's admission to Mercosur was the belief that Chavez could better be controlled from within the organization than if left to his own devices on the "outside.  It appears in hindsight, however, that Chavez has "
proved to be more difficult to contain than originally thought by Mercosur members. Chavez has openly challenged the Brazilians by supporting and allegedly encouraging Evo "Morales's move to grab Petrobras' assets in Bolivia, and has "frequently stolen the stage at Mercosur gatherings from "Brazil's President Lula.  That friction, however, provides an "opportunity. "EXPANDING REACH OF DEFENSE, CAUSING UNSTABLE CONDITIONS "
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 7. (C) Venezuela has expanded its reach into the region using military advisors and intelligence officers to reach out to "leftist groups as well as directly engage """"ilitary ,,,,,,,""counterparts through exchange programs.
