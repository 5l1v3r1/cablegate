1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Sweden is "worried" about the November 9 
municipal elections in Nicaragua but has not yet called for a 
vote recount.  Instead, it will follow EU consensus on the 
issue, expected to be reached at the EU's COLAT meeting in 
January. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) On December 1, Poloff delivered reftel demarche to 
Mikael Stahl, Americas Department Desk Officer.  Stahl 
explained that the officer in charge of Nicaraguan issues, 
Sara Ramirez, was on leave but that he would ask her to call 
when she returned.  On December 11, Poloff spoke with 
Ramirez, who noted that Sweden has joined others in the EU in 
expressing "worries" about the municipal elections but that 
Stockholm was not yet demanding a recount.  Instead, Ramirez 
noted, the issue of scheduled for discussion by EU Latin 
America experts at January's COLAT working group and Sweden 
will follow the EU consensus. 
 
¶3. (U) Ramirez added that Sweden closed its embassy in 
Managua on September 1 after the Swedish International 
Development Agency, SIDA, decided to end development 
cooperation in Nicaragua.  She stated that SIDA has been 
directed to focus development efforts in fewer countries, and 
had decided to close programs in 40 of the 70 countries where 
it worked.  Once the SIDA mission folded up, the main reason 
for the embassy presence disappeared also.  Relations with 
Nicaragua and five other Central American states are handled 
out of Sweden's mission in Guatemala now, Ramirez noted.
