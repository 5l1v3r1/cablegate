To the People of the United States of America 
Thirty years ago in the turmoil of the revolutionary zeal and 
indefensible act of hostage taking was committed that the new 
generation of Iran are not proud of at all.  We know very well how 
that deplorable action hurt the noble American people and how it led 
to three decades of unnecessary and painful bad relations between 
our two nations. 
 
Only a small and repressive minority who rule Iran today still 
insist on keeping Iran on a confrontation course with the US, 
Britain and the West and indeed they have now taken the Iranian 
people as hostage to their destructive policies. 
 
With sincere best wishes, 
 
The Green Movement of the People of Iran
