¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Bo Diczfalusy, Director-General for Energy 
at the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Transportation, and 
MFA Baltic Desk Officer Isabella Torngren, told Econoffs on 
April 27 that Sweden: 
 
- views energy security as a key part of its EU Presidency 
focus on the Baltic Sea Strategy; 
 
- concurs with the U.S. that the Baltics need to cooperate 
more closely; 
 
- is pleased that the EU and the Baltic countries will fund 
Swedlink, a 700-1,000 MW undersea electricity cable, that 
will go to Lithuania, but be available for all three Baltic 
countries.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On April 27, Econoff discussed reftel points 
regarding greater Baltic energy security with Bo Diczfalusy, 
Director-General for Energy at the Ministry of Enterprise, 
Energy and Transportation, and MFA Baltic Desk Officer 
Isabella Torngren.  Diczfalusy told us that Sweden shares the 
U.S. view that energy security is a major challenge for the 
Baltic countries.  Torngren added that Sweden "couldn't agree 
more" with the U.S. position that the Baltics need to 
cooperate more closely. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Diczfalusy commented that Sweden's general policy 
is to support countries to choose their own energy options as 
long as they follow prudent security guidelines, adding that 
if asked Sweden would provide assistance in helping to 
determine these guidelines.  Torngren pointed out that Baltic 
energy security will form a key part of Sweden's Baltic Sea 
Strategy when it assumes the EU Presidency July 1 (reftel B). 
 The three Baltics states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
agreed April 27 that the long-discussed "Swedlink" high 
voltage cable will make landfall in Lithuania, linking their 
electricity grid to Sweden. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The new Swedlink cable will provide an estimated 
700-1,000 Megawatts and will run from Sweden to Lithuania. 
Both Diczfalusy and Torngren said one of the preconditions 
for establishing Swedlink is an open energy market with equal 
access for all three Baltic countries.  Diczfalusy said the 
EU would fund approximately one-third of the estimated Euro 
1.6 billion cost of the project, and that estimated 
completion of the project is 2016.
