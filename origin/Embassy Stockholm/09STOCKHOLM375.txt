REF: 08 STOCKHOLM 769 
 
¶1. Summary:  With the opening of the new Swedish embassy in 
Baghdad this summer, all signs point to further strengthening 
and deepening of the cooperative ties between Sweden and 
Iraq.  Trade deals between Swedish companies and Iraq 
partners are inching forward despite financing troubles and 
security concerns, and development cooperation is projected 
to increase.  End Summary. 
 
Swedish Embassy in Baghdad to house trade council 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. At a recent meeting at the Swedish Foreign Ministry, Bengt 
Carlsson, Senior Advisor for Trade and Trade Promotion, told 
Emboffs that he was enthusiastic about trade with Iraq, 
citing a 33 percent increase in Swedish exports to Iraq from 
2007 to 2008.  This represented between $10 to 15 million, 
although Carlsson expressed some puzzlement over what he 
considered to be a lower-than-expected increase in these 
numbers.  However, he noted that the first wave of "big 
businesses" in Sweden, such as Volvo, Scania, Ericsson, and 
Alfa Laval, had all been working on trade with Iraq, which he 
expected to continue in the future. 
 
¶3. With regard to Swedish-Iraqi trade cooperation, Charlotta 
Rodhe, MFA Iraq Desk officer, described a reference group of 
businesspeople in Sweden who meet with the MFA on a regular 
basis.  She said that the MFA, along with these groups, "talk 
about Iraq all the time." Her focus has been on "building 
bridges" to increase trade between Sweden and Iraq.  She also 
noted the "symbolic value" of signing memorandums of 
understanding to support building these ties. 
 
¶4. Rodhe stated that the Swedish Embassy in Baghdad was set 
to open early this summer. She told us that there would be 
seven diplomats posted at the compound, and they would 
eventually be joined by others from the Swedish Trade Council 
and from the Swedish International Development Cooperation 
Agency (SIDA). 
 
Getting things moving a challenge 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Emboffs also met with representatives at Scania, the 
Swedish manufactures of trucks and busses.  Lars Andersson, 
Senior Advisor, and Gustaf Sundell, Sales Representative, 
discussed the continuing momentum from at November 2008 
meeting between Iraqi officials and Minister for Trade Ewa 
Bjorling. Andersson and Sundell said that a memorandum of 
understanding had been signed for Scania to provide Iraq with 
500 units of trucks to be assembled at Scania's SCAI factory 
in Iskanderyia.  These trucks will primarily be used for 
water and fuel transport. 
 
¶6.  Since November 2008, Scania representatives have traveled 
to Baghdad several times to finalize negotiations.  Andersson 
complained that Scania had not yet received a letter of 
credit from the Trade Bank of Iraq (TBI) for the first 
installment of these trucks (150), and that they had 
approached Iraqi officials at the highest levels to "get 
things moving." 
 
¶7. The Scania representatives discussed their need for 
security at the Iskanderyia factory, where several hundred 
employees currently work.  Andersson and Sundell expressed 
their gratitude for security provided by U.S. troops at 
previous meetings in Baghdad, and they requested information 
on how to find contacts for either foreign or Iraqi security 
companies in the future.  Sundell also mentioned that their 
Iraqi partners seemed to be out-of-date in terms of equipment 
and training.  In spite of these challenges, the Scania 
representatives stressed their long presence in Iraq (since 
the 1970s) and reiterated their commitment to fostering trade 
in Iraq ahead of competitors such as Mercedes. 
 
Committed to development cooperation 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶8.  Iraq Desk officer Charlotta Rodhe highlighted the Foreign 
Ministry's commitment to development cooperation, referencing 
SIDA's position that there are "strong humanitarian reasons 
and close ties that justify a Swedish commitment" in Iraq. 
There are currently about 110,000 Iraqis living in Sweden, 
and these Iraqis are viewed as important links in developing 
a trade network between the two countries.  According to a 
new report from Swedfund, the Swedish risk capital company 
specializing in developing countries, Iraq's economic 
capacity is becoming increasingly more stable, making the 
country more open to foreign investment.  To support economic

growth, Swedfund calls for more aid in the area of democratic 
capacity building. 
 
¶9.  SIDA contributed some $19 million in development 
assistance to Iraq in 2008, of which the largest portion went 
to humanitarian aid.  Rodhe stressed the intention of 
continued support from the MFA, with SIDA and Swedfund, to 
take on small projects with "specific goals" in the areas of 
rule of law, human rights and economic development. 
 
¶10.  Comment: Swedish business and government excitement 
about economic work in Iraq is evident and should prove 
valuable in the coming months.
