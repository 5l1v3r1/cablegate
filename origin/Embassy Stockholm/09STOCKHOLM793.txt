1 (SBU) Summary: Embassy review of Swedish government public 
websites reveal official encouragement of Swedish exports to 
Iran: 
 
- The Swedish Exports Credit Guarantee Board (EKN) 
"January-June 2009 Report" ranks Iran in third place of the 
113 countries where it has provided export guarantees in the 
first half of 2009, and fourth place in the number of 
outstanding export guarantees. 
 
- On a Swedish-language Swedish Trade Council Middle East 
website, Sweden trumpets its export growth to Iran, saying: 
"Swedish exports to Iran doubled last year, making Iran 
Sweden's fourth largest export market in the Middle East in 
2008."  Swedish Trade Council Middle East Director Mats 
Paulson called Iran a "very interesting market with a 
well-developed engineering industry."  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post continues to review Swedish governmental 
websites in Swedish and English and has found the following 
related to Iran: 
 
- A Swedish Trade Council article in Swedish 
(www.swedishtrade.se) from summer/fall 2009 entitled 
"Business Continues in Iran" states: "Swedish exports to Iran 
doubled last year, making Iran Sweden's fourth largest export 
market in the Middle East in 2008.  Despite the recent 
political unrest in the country, business continues as usual. 
 Sweden has good business relations with Iran, and Swedish 
products enjoy a good reputation in the country. There is a 
large number of Swedish companies in Iran, including ABB, 
Alfa Laval, Ericsson, Tetra Pak and Oriflame (a perfume 
company operated by a Swedish-Iranian)."  The article went on 
to quote the Swedish Trade Council Middle East Director Mats 
Paulson, who said that a recently canceled visit by a trade 
delegation from Sweden (due to the unrest following the 
Iranian elections) would be carried out at a later date 
"because Iran is a very interesting market with a 
well-developed engineering industry."  The article concluded 
by stating that "the purpose of delegation was to promote 
business relations between Sweden and Iran." 
 
- The Swedish Exports Credit Guarantee Board (EKN) 
"January-June 2009 Report" stated as follows: "At the top of 
the list of the 113 countries where we have guaranteed 
transactions during the first half are Pakistan, Nigeria, 
Iran, Russia, Belarus, Turkey and Mexico."  The report also 
provides a chart entitled "The 10 Largest Countries - 
Exposure, SEK Million. Outstanding Guarantees and Indemnified 
Claims 30 June 2009" that lists Iran as fourth (after Sweden, 
Pakistan and South Africa) in number of Outstanding 
Guarantees. 
 
- December 2009: A preliminary agenda of the "Middle East 
Summit 2009" in Abu Dhabi, UAE organized by the Swedish Trade 
Council Middle East to discuss business strategies and trade 
opportunities in the region listed Iran as a "Country Block 
Workshop."  Swedish Ambassador to Iran Magnus Wernstedt, 
Soheil Rahgozar of the Swedish Embassy in Iran and Daniel 
Mokari, the Swedish Trade Council in the UAE were listed as 
Iran Workshop participants. 
 
- November 2009: An advertisement for Iran Telecom 2009 
(Tehran International Fairgrounds) that listed Sweden as an 
exhibitor. 
 
- July 2009: A statement by the Swedish Exports Credit 
Guarantee Board (EKN) regarding export credits for an 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to be granted no sooner 
than 30 days after the EIA findings have been made public 
(www.ekn.se).  The EIA in question is for an oil refinery at 
Esfahan, Iran.  The attached document describing the project 
is in Swedish only and states that "an MKB was compiled for 
the project in 2005."  (Comment: We have been unable to 
identify "MKB." End Comment.)  The four-page document does 
not mention the name of any company, but was published in 
July 2009.  Although the document does not mention whether or 
not export credits were granted, it clearly indicates that 
the EKN was at least interested in providing export credit 
for a project that involved the Iranian oil and gas sector. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Although our Swedish interlocutors continue 
to tell us that Europe's overall trade with Iran is falling, 
 
STOCKHOLM 00000793  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
the statements and information found on Swedish and English 
language websites shows that Sweden's trade with Iran is 
growing.  We are urging Swedish government interlocutors to 
review this trade relationship closely so as not to undercut 
UNSCRs, U.S. and EU policies, all of which dictate a lessened 
commercial engagement with Iran.
