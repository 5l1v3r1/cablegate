¶1. Poloff met today with Deputy Secretary of State for 
Foreign Affairs, Alejandra Liriano, regarding REF A request 
for assistance.  Liriano took the request under advisement 
and committed to informing the Embassy when/if the Dominican 
government takes a position. 
 
¶2. COMMENT: Liriano's inability to comment, even 
unofficially, in is line with the Dominican government's 
failure to respond to REF B's similar call for assistance. 
Embassy assesses that political complications, as suggested 
by REF C, may indefinitely delay response, but will relay 
immediately any substantive response.  END COMMENT.
