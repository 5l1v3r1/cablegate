REF: STATE 022969 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy officer delivered talking points in paras 
5-6 reftel to MFA director for UN affairs Michelle Cohen and 
separately to deputy director Rhadys Abreu de Polanco, who 
will go to Geneva for the annual UN Human Rights Committee 
meeting.  Embassy expressed particular appreciation for the 
Dominican Republic's crucial vote to approve the CHR 
resolution on Cuba last year.  Cohen and Polanco were aware 
of the Mexican initiative on an "informal consultation 
mechanism for human rights in Latin America," but neither 
official had any immediate reaction to our demarche. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: The Dominican Republic in the past has 
supported country-specific resolutions on Cuba and other 
human rights violators.  However, the Dominican vote last 
year was decided personally by then-President Mejia (PRD). 
We do not yet have an indication what position the 
administration of President Fernandez (PLD), inaugurated in 
August, may take at this year's CHR.
