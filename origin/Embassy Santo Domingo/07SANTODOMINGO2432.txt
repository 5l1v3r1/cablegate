REF: STATE 147320 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per Reftel instructions, POLOFF contacted the 
Embassy of Argentina in Santo Domingo to offer United States 
support for Argentina's request for the issuance of INTERPOL 
Red Notices for the Iranian officials charged in the 1994 
AMIA bombing.  Counselor Fernando Ricci replied that his 
Embassy had made its demarche to the GODR and that the 
Dominican response had been "favorable."  Ricci said that his 
Embassy appreciated the U.S. offer of support and would 
contact us if, in the future, his government required 
assistance in working with the Dominicans on the Red Notices.
