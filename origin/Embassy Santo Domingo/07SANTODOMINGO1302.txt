     ¶B. SANTO DOMINGO 0715 
 
¶1. On May 31 Charge, accompanied by Brazilian Ambassador 
Ronaldo Dunlop, delivered ref A demarche to Jose Manuel 
Trullols, Chief of Staff to Foreign Minister Morales (Morales 
briefly dropped by the meeting).  Trullols was joined by MFA 
Adjunct Ambassador Juan Pla Gomez. 
 
¶2. Trullols welcomed the new information on the joint 
Brazilian and U.S. offer of assistance in developing biofuels 
capacity, as had Morales when the Embassy last delivered a 
demarche on this subject (ref B).  Trullols observed that 
several positive factors are converging that will help 
develop the biofuels sector, including interest from the 
Dominican private sector and the U.S.-Brazilian initiative. 
 
¶3. Trullols pledged to (i) brief the Foreign Minister on our 
demarche prior to his departure for the OAS General Assembly, 
and (ii) respond to the questions posed in the demarche. 
Regarding establishing a point of contact in the Dominican 
Government for follow up, the Chief of Staff said that the 
decision would be made by President Fernandez.  In fact, 
because of the involvement in biofuels by multiple agencies 
-- e.g. Foreign Affairs, Industry and Commerce, and the 
National Energy Commission -- he is recommending that the 
Foreign Minister have a broad discussion of biofuels issues 
with the President.  Trullols asked to be kept informed of 
the planned visit of USTDA officers. 
 
¶4. Ambassador Pla noted that the Dominican Republic and 
Brazil had signed a Memorandum of Understanding on biofuels 
cooperation in April, and expressed a desire to ensure that 
any new accords signed by the Dominicans not be in conflict 
with the MOU.  (The MOU was approved yesterday by the 
Dominican Congress.)
