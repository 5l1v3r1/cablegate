REF: STATE 132517 
 
¶1.  On August 14, we faxed to MFA Multilateral Affairs Director 
Susan Gordon UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and accompanying 
talking points, as specified in the August 12 demarche request. 
When we asked Gordon on August 15 for her reaction, she said she had 
not had an opportunity to read the material. 
¶2.  COMMENT: We do not expect a substantive reaction to the 
demarche.  Gordon's slow response reflects MFA's longstanding 
disengaged attitude toward developments in the Middle East.  END 
COMMENT.
