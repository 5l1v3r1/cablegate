SUBJECT: FIRST VICE GOVERNOR OF PRIMORYE SHOT IN VLADIVOSTOK 
 
¶1.  (U)  On January 28, Primorye's First Vice Governor Sergey 
Sopchuk was shot as he was leaving home for work.  The apparent 
assassination attempt failed and Sopchuk is reportedly 
recuperating in a Vladivostok hospital in satisfactory condition 
with wounds to his shoulder and hands.  Police have a 
description of a suspect but no arrests.  Vice Governor 
Sopchuk's official portfolio includes international affairs, 
land, utilities, agriculture and fishing. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)According to one Consulate source, Sopchuk controls a 
Russian-Chinese border crossing point and he is believed to be 
involved in smuggling.  While there are economic reasons for 
Sopchuk to have enemies, Consulate contacts suggest the 
assassination attempt could have more to do with political 
intrigue.  Governor Darkin has long been rumored to be on the 
Kremlin's chopping block and Sopchuk is seen by some as a 
potential successor to the high powered post of Governor. 
Meanwhile, Governor Darkin has insisted that his Deputies sign 
their own official documents, to "keep his hands clean" should 
any of his Deputies be accused of wrongdoing.  With federal 
money coming into the Russian Far East to fund a new development 
plan, the post of Governor is more powerful than ever. 
 
¶3. (U)  Governor Darkin is quoted on the RIA Prima Media press 
service as saying this  attempt to intimidate the public and the 
administration has failed and he expressed confidence that the 
person responsible would be brought to justice swiftly. 
 
¶4. (U)  Sopchuk is 43, married, and has three children.
