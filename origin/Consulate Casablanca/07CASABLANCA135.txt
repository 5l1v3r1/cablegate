¶1.  (U) This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Summary: On June 20, the Government of Morocco announced 
it would sign a cooperation agreement with the United Nations High 
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) delivering full diplomatic status to 
the UNHCR office in Rabat.  The surprise announcement came from 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Secretary General Omar Hilale, 
during UNHCR's annual observation of World Refugee Day.  The new 
status will mean that the UNHCR Mission will have the ability to 
move forward authoritatively on a number of proposals and will be 
able to work officially for the first time with a number of Moroccan 
Ministries and organizations.  According to UNHCR's Office Director 
the expected signing date for the accord is July 20, in Geneva.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------- 
Agreement Announced 
------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) After more than a year of negotiations, the GOM surprised 
UNHCR officials by announcing its plan to sign a cooperation 
agreement and officially recognize UNHCR's mission in Rabat.  The 
announcement, delivered by MFA Secretary General Omar Hilale, came 
during the organization's June 20 World Refugee Day gathering in 
Rabat.  For months negotiations languished over a paragraph, 
inserted into the accord by the GOM, requesting that UNHCR Rabat 
take over responsibility for Western Sahara refugee issues.  This 
request was in direct conflict with UNHCR's mandate to seperate the 
Rabat mission's work from any issues in the Western Sahara. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) According to UNHCR's office director Johannes Van Der 
Klaauw the GOM had given his organization no indication that the 
Western Sahara paragraph was dropped or that the agreement was 
imminent.  Van Der Klaauw told poloff that he believed that the 
GOM's decision to change the status of the office from honorary to 
official was in part a direct result of a number of measures taken 
by his office in the last 18 months.  Van Der Klaauw said that the 
GOM has been concerned that official recognition of the office would 
create a magnet for sub-Saharan migrants seeking refugee status.  He 
explained, however, that his updated handling process for possible 
refugees and asylum seekers has proven successful and has actually 
reduced significantly the number of sub-Saharans seeking refuge at 
the Rabat office. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Van Der Klaauw claimed the GOM had been watching closely 
to see how his office handled a number of issues that could have 
reflected poorly on Morocco, including: a roundup and forced 
deportation of recognized refugees and clandestine migrants by 
Moroccan security forces in December of 2006; the outcome of 
numerous sit-ins in front of UNHCR's office; and most recently, a 
very frank interview with Van Der Klaauw on Al Jazeera TV.  Van Der 
Klaauw views the two years since his arrival in Morocco as a test by 
the GOM.  "It looks like we finally passed" quipped Van Der Klaauw 
to poloff. 
 
------------------------ 
The Next Steps for UNHCR 
------------------------ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Official recognition of the mission will mean diplomatic 
status for UNHCR for the first time since an honorary office was 
established in Casablanca fifty years ago.  The accord will permit 
UNHCR staff to move about the country freely to deal with refugee 
issues that occur outside the capital and especially in the 
north-east where refugees mix with clandestine migrants in high 
numbers. 
 
7  (U)  The new accord will also open the door for UNHCR to begin 
working officially with the GOM to assist recognized refugees and 
asylum seekers.  Van Der Klaauw is in the process of finalizing a 
Plan of Action which will soon be submitted to Moroccan authorities. 
 The Plan will propose a joint registration system for refugees and 
asylum seekers as well as numerous joint projects to assist UNHCR 
persons of interest through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the 
Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministries of Health and 
Education.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  (U)  Comment: In recent years Morocco has become an increasingly 
popular transit point for clandestine migrants from sub-Saharan 
countries on their way to a European "El Dorado".  Morocco feels 
pressure both domestically and from the EU to manage the flow of 
illegal migrants in the country.  Because of this pressure the GOM 
has been slow to react to UNHCR's request for recognition, fearing 
an even larger deluge of migrants seeking to gain refugee status 
with UNHCR.  Morocco has also been concerned about refugees from 
countries as far away as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
the Ivory Coast, who travel great distances and pass through 
numerous other countries with UNHCR missions, stopping in Morocco to 
seek refugee status and causing a financial drain on the country. 
While their concerns are understandable they are, according to 
UNHCR, irrelevant. 
 
¶9. (U)  In granting diplomatic status to UNCHR, however, 
the GOM has finally acknowledged that there are legitimate refugees 
and asylum seekers among the thousands of migrants who pass through 
their country every year.  With this accord, Morocco has finally 
begun to fulfill its international responsibilities to the UN 
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.  End Comment.
