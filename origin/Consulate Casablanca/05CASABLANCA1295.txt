¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Representatives of the Financial 
Services Volunteer Corps (FSVC), accompanied by 
Ambassador and Econoff, met with Prime Minister Jettou 
on December 2 to discuss FSVC's programs and solicit 
Jettou's thoughts on Morocco's financial sector. 
Jettou described Morocco's business environment as 
traditionally "protected" from competition and 
disoriented by the challenges of recent trade 
agreements and globalization.  He characterized many 
businesses as "undercapitalized, debt burdened and 
lacking good management".  He also discussed proposed 
GOM initiatives for debt-refinancing of Small and 
Medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and new tax exemption 
incentives and asked about FSVC programs regarding 
SMEs.  End summary 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Jettou began by thanking FSVC for its work 
with Bank Al Maghrib (the Moroccan Central Bank)and 
raised the issue of how to develop the environment for 
SMEs.  FSVC discussed its efforts to help implement 
Bank Al Maghrib Governor Jouhari's internal development 
plan, highlighting a program using public affairs 
professionals from the U.S. Federal Reserve to assist 
Bank Al Maghrib officials to better communicate 
policies.  FSVC explained that its priorities are job 
creation and economic growth, aligning itself with the 
economic priorities of Jettou's administration.  FSVC 
President Andrew Spindler then proceeded to describe 
recent activities directed toward SME development, 
including a program to promote successful SME Initial 
Public Offerings (IPOs) on the Casablanca Stock 
Exchange. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Prime Minister described how small 
enterprises (and Moroccan businesses generally) have 
been traditionally sheltered from competition, but how 
with the advent of trade agreements and a quickened 
pace of globalization, it is impossible to protect 
industries from international competitors.  "Our 
businesses need to learn to compete" Jettou explained, 
adding that too many Moroccan enterprises are 
undercapitalized, debt burdened and lack good 
management.  AMB agreed and added that many also fail 
to invest sufficiently in business development and 
expansion. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Jettou expressed the need to bridge the gap 
between micro credit lending (maximum of approximately 
US $2,000) and commercial bank lending (minimum of 
approximately US $50,000) in order to help SMEs.  He 
explained that US $25,000 is the "magic number" and 
acknowledged a current internal GOM debate over whether 
it is more effective to employ incentives to raise 
micro credit levels or decrease those of banks.  Jettou 
also mentioned GOM programs to refinance SME debt and 
provide tax exemption incentives to attract skilled 
younger workers to Morocco.  The Prime Minister closed 
the meeting with assurances that the GOM is committed 
to passing all FTA-related legislation in time for 
January 1, 2006 implementation date, and that the last 
pieces of legislation are currently before Parliament. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  Jettou's private sector background 
and reputation as a technocrat lend credibility to his 
candid appraisal of private sector insecurity on the 
implications of free trade agreements and greater 
globalization.  New GOM initiatives focused on 
promoting economic growth and job creation through SME 
financing and creative use of tax exemptions bode well 
for improvement of the business climate and success of 
the soon-to-be implemented FTA.  Jettou conducted the 
entire meeting in English, (Jettou is known for 
beginning meetings with American interlocutors in 
English before quickly returning to French) reflecting 
his increasing comfort and interest in discussing 
business and financial sector-related issues with 
Americans.  End comment
