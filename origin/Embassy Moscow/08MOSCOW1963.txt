Â¶1. (SBU) On June 25, we passed reftel information on the U.S. 
priorities for the Universal Postal Union (UPU) Congress to be held 
July 23 to August 12 in Geneva to GOR officials at the MFA's North 
America Department, the International Department of the Ministry of

Administration and the Postal Operations Council.
