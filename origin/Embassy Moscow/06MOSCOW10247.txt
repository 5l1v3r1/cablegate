Embassy has no objection to the proposed OPIC loan guarantee 
for SDM Bank to provide loans to small and medium enterprises 
outlined in Reftel A.  Moreover, Consolidated Consular 
Database checks reveal no adverse information about the 
bank's CEO and major shareholders.  Reftel B, Embassy's 2005 
banking sector report, notes that in recent years, bank 
assets have shifted more heavily to loans of various types. 
Consumer lending has grown most rapidly, but significant 
potential remains for developing lending to small and medium 
enterprises.  Embassy will provide a copy of this report and 
additional information on Russia's banking sector and 
Firebird Management's activities in Russia to Senior 
Investment/Finance Officer Richard Greenberg.
