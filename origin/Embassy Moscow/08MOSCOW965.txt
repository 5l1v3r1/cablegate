RESPONSE TO ESTONIA'S OFFER TO DRAFT JOINT EDITORIAL 
 
REF: State 35246 
 
Sensitive But Unclassified, Protect Accordingly. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On April 8, we delivered reftel inquiries regarding the 
Estonian Prime Minister's idea to draft a three-way editorial on the 
importance of international cooperation to combat nuclear 
proliferation to Senior Counselor Vladimir Prokhorov, MFA Department 
on New Challenges and Threats.  Prokhorov told us that Russia does 
not support the idea of Estonia drafting the joint editorial.  In 
the MFA's opinion, Estonia has just joined the GICNT and Russia has 
not yet seen any plans or actions from Estonia that would warrant it 
drafting this document. 
 
¶2.  (U)  For future reference, Prokhorov indicated that the key MFA 
points of contact for the GICNT are: 
 
Oleg Vyacheslavovich Rozhkov (Deputy Director, Department for 
Security and Disarmament Affairs (DVBR)) 
 
Alexey Yurievich Karpov (Senior Counselor, DVBR) 
 
Olga Igorevna Kuznetsova (Secretary) 
 
For routine GCINT actions, Senior Counselor Karpov would be the 
appropriate point of contact.  His email is a generic address in 
DVBR - dvbr@mid.ru .  Put his name in the subject line.  His fax 
(from the US) is 011 7 (495) 253-9082 or 9083.
