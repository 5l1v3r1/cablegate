(SBU)  On December 12, ESToff delivered reftel points 
regarding Russian support for consensus on the text agreed ad 
referendum at the conclusion of the November 19-20 meeting of 
the NSG Consultative Group in Vienna to First Secretary Olga 
Kuznetsova, Nuclear Affairs Officer in the MFA Department of 
Security and Disarmament Affairs (DVBR).  Kuznetsova 
indicated she was not aware of any strong opinions within the 
MFA that would preclude Russia's support for consensus.  But 
she said that she could not give a firm answer at this time. 
She promised to confer with DVBR Deputy Director Oleg Rozhkov 
and others and pass a more complete answer to ESToff early 
next week.
