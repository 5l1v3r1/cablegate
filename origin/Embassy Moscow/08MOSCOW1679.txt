DESIGNATING 4 INDIVIDUALS UNDER TARGETED SANCTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 61842 
 
(SBU) We delivered reftel demarch on June 11 to MFA Senior 
Counselor for International Organizations Peter Ilichev. 
Ilichev said that while Russia supported designating the four 
individuals named in reftel under targeted sanctions, he 
could not say whether the GOR would press other countries to 
do the same.  Ilichev promised to take our points under 
consideration and pass them on to a higher level at the MFA.
