SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE CHECK ON 
APPLICATION 050056021 
 
REF: STATE 113599 
 
¶1.  (U) Reftel requested a pre-license check to confirm the bona 
fides of FNPZ NefteGazAeroKosmos Ltd., the foreign end-user and NPO 
Geophizika-NV, the foreign consignee listed on application 
¶050056021.  The commodities in question are 10 NV-2AMA White filters 
(216mm x 168mm x 3mm) (NVIS filters) valued at USD 23,000.00. 
 
¶2.  (U) On September 4, 2007, we visited the headquarters of NPO 
Geophizika-NV located at Matrosskaja Tishina 23, Building 2, Moscow 
107076, Russia.  The team met with Mr. Yury K. Gruzevich, Vice 
President of NPO Geophisika-NV and Mr. Valery Toryanin, General 
Director of FNPZ NefteGazAeroKosmos Ltd. 
 
¶3.  (U) FNPZ NefteGazAeroKosmos Ltd. and NPO Geophizika-NV have 
supporting documentation for the transaction, including licenses for 
research and development, production, and repair of equipment. 
 
¶4.  (U) NPO Geophizika-NV occupies 70,000 sq. meters in Eastern 
Moscow.  This location is restricted and secured by special Federal 
Police Directorate.  Only high-ranking company officials have access 
to the highly-secure areas of the compound. 
 
¶5.  (U) At the request of FNPZ NefteGazAeroKosmos Ltd., NVIS filters 
will be installed on 10 Ka-226 light civilian helicopters by 
Geophisika-NV.  These helicopters will then be used to monitor oil 
and gas pipelines in remote areas.  Gazprom eventually wants to 
equip 150 helicopters with NVIS filters.  NVIS filters are necessary 
to make lights inside the helicopter crew cabin not interfere with 
night vision goggles worn by pilots.  These helicopters will be 
parked in secure facilities in remote parts of Russia when not in 
use. 
 
¶6.  (U) NefteGazAeroKosmos was founded in 1996 and is a subsidiary 
of the Russian oil and gas company, GazProm.  GazProm proper owns 53 
percent of NefteGazAeroKosmos.  Selena-Aero, which serves as 
GazProm's procurement arm for aerial operations, owns an additional 
9 percent of NefteGazAeroKosmos, bringing the total GazProm interest 
in NefteGazAeroKosmos to 62 percent.  NPO Geophizika-NV is a 
state-owned enterprise founded in 1849. 
 
¶7.  (U) FNPZ NefteGazAeroKosmos Ltd. and NPO Geophizika-NV keep 
proper records of all transactions and store them in secure 
locations. 
 
¶8.  (U) FNPZ NefteGazAeroKosmos Ltd. and NPO Geophizika-NV are aware 
of all restrictions and regulations on USML and other export control 
prohibitions. 
 
¶9.  (U) Post confirms the bona fides of FNPZ NefteGazAeroKosmos Ltd. 
as a reliable end-user and NPO Geophizika-NV as a reliable foreign 
consignee of the NVIS filters as mentioned in Case 050056021.
