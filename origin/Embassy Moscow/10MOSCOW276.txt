RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 6703 
 
¶1. On January 26, Post delivered reftel demarche to the Russian 
Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and 
the Ministry of Health and Social Development.  As of February 8, 
post has received no substantive response.  The Ministry of 
Transportation told us that of the three ministries, the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs is most likely to be able to provide relevant 
information.  We also provided the demarche to the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, which is studying the request for information. 
Officials from the Ministry of Health and Social Development 
provided no substantive response.  (NOTE:  The Ministry of Health 
and Social Development deals only with the public health aspects of 
road safety; we do not expect that it will respond.  END NOTE.) 
Post will report any substantive response it receives. 
 
¶2. Russian Government Decree number 67 (dated January 24, 2001 and 
entered into force on April 1, 2001) amends an earlier regulation on 
road safety by introducing the following language: "Drivers in 
motion are prohibited... from using a telephone not equipped with a 
technical apparatus allowing for hands-free use."
