¶1.  The MFA's response to the dipnote delivered per Ref A 
argues that the Russian Federation is not responsible for 
satisfying claims on obligations dating back to the Russian 
Empire.  An unofficial translation of the dipnote's entire 
text follows. 
 
Begin Text: 
 
"Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation 
 
No. 2272/DSA 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States 
of America and, in connection with the U.S. Embassy's Note 
No. 22 of March 20, 2008, concerning compensation to holders 
of securities issued by the Russian Imperial Government, has 
the honor to advise the following: 
 
Settling financial claims stemming from guarantees provided 
by the Russian Imperial Government or securities issued by 
that government and placed in foreign states as well as 
settling other financial and nonproperty claims of foreign 
individuals and legal entities against the Russian Empire is 
not an obligation of the Russian Federation.  Such claims 
cannot be accepted by the Russian Federation as a subject of 
negotiations either now or in the future. 
 
Debts of the Russian Empire, including those in the form of 
bonds, were annulled by a decree of the All-Russia Central 
Executive Committee of February 3 (January 21) 1918.  Neither 
the USSR nor the Russian Federation has assumed any 
obligations to the holders of said securities to pay or 
settle those debts. 
 
The Ministry avails itself of the opportunity to extend to 
the Embassy of the United States of America renewed 
assurances of its highest consideration. 
 
Moscow, June 9, 2008 
 
To the Embassy of the United States of America 
 
Moscow"
