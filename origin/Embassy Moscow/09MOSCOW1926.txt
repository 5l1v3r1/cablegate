SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW PARTICIPATION 
 
REF: STATE 76723 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  MFA DVBR Deputy Director Mashkov told us Russia 
wanted the upcoming UNSCR 1540 Comprehensive Review to address 
serious issues, and was concerned that allowing participation of 
international organizations such as the Australia Group, 
Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, and the G8 Global 
Partnership would prevent the review from accomplishing its 
substantive goals.  Contending that Russia had not agreed to the 
international organizations' participation in December 2007 and that 
they would not add value to the Comprehensive Review, Mashkov said 
Russia could instead support participation by the individual member 
states.  He suggested that the UNSCR 1540 Committee needed to speak 
with one voice if states like the DPRK were to take it seriously, 
and adding international organizations to the list of participants 
would make it less likely for this to happen.  Ambassador raised the 
issue with MFA North America Director Neverov who claimed it was not 
his issue and suggested follow-up with other MFA senior officials. 
End summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
UNSCR 1540 Has Become Too Stylish 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On July 24 we delivered reftel demarche to MFA DVBR Deputy 
Director Grigoriy Mashkov, who told us that the GOR shared the same 
strategic goals as the U.S. regarding UNSCR 1540.  While the 
September 30-October 2 Comprehensive Review should be open to all 
interested governments, Mashkov complained however, that UNSCR 1540 
had become "stylish," and so many international organizations that 
did not conduct business related to UNSCR 1540's goals want to join 
in the Comprehensive Review and discuss topics unrelated to UNSCR 
1540, such as human rights concerns.  "Wedding Generals are not 
needed," he said, arguing that Russia took the UNSCR 1540 
Comprehensive Review seriously and wanted it to accomplish serious 
goals.  Many international organizations "say much and do nothing," 
he said, and would add no value to the proceedings.  He said that so 
many international organizations were already scheduled to take part 
in the Comprehensive Review that it would take a full day just to 
listen to all the introductory remarks as the organizations "told 
everyone how great they were."  Russia did not want the 
Comprehensive Review to be simply a "showcase."  Russia wanted real 
results, he said. 
 
----------------------------- 
Need to Continue Serious Work 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mashkov argued that the Comprehensive Review would discuss 
many sensitive issues such as the structure of the UNSCR 1540 
committee and how it functions.  Only those serious about the 
committee's work should therefore be allowed to participate in the 
meeting.  He added that the committee was just beginning its serious 
work, and that approximately 30 countries had not yet submitted 
their initial reports.  It was therefore very important that the 
Comprehensive Review achieve concrete results.

UNSCR 1540 Committee Must Speak With One Voice 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4. (SBU) Mashkov posited that countries such as DPRK would listen to 
the UNSCR 1540 committee only if it spoke with one voice.  He 
expressed concern that international organizations whose mandates 
were beyond the purview of UNSCR 1540 would distract the committee 
by raising potentially contentious issues.  He pointed out that 
Australia, with U.S. support, was already doing this by raising the 
issue of human rights during UNSCR 1540 meetings.  This should not 
continue, he argued. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Opposition to the Australia Group 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Australia Group (AG) is the only major arms-control 
regime to which Russia is not a member, and this has been a sore 
spot for the GOR, Mashkov said.  He denied the GOR had ever agreed 
to the AG's participation, despite reftel information that the GOR 
had agreed at a December 17, 2007, meeting.  He said the GOR would 
never agree to AG participation under any circumstances.  If the AG 
participated in the Comprehensive Review, Russia would walk out, he 
insisted.  When it was suggested that the GOR at least talk to the 
AG to see what value it could add to the Comprehensive Review, 
Mashkov replied that, since Russia was not a member, the AG "did not 
even exist" as far as the GOR was concerned.  He finished by saying 
that we "should not even try" to include the AG.

Opposition to OIF

¶6. (SBU) Mashkov also denied the GOR agreed to Organisation 
Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) participation at the 
December 17, 2007 meeting.  He argued the OIF's desire to join in 
the Comprehensive Review was a symptom of UNSCR 1540 becoming 
"stylish," and he wondered what an organization set up to promote 
French language and culture could contribute.  (Note:  He also 
wondered why the U.S. would support the OIF, other than for reasons 
of NATO solidarity.  End note.)  The group's mandate is simply not 
related to UNSCR 1540.  He worried this might set a precedent for 
other similar groups.  Mashkov said the GOR would not object if the 
individual member states participated in the meeting, but the OIF 
should not be used to somehow "sponsor" or facilitate their 
participation.  He said that about two-thirds of the states that had 
not yet submitted their initial reports were in Africa, but he 
encouraged their participation only as individual states.  He said 
the OIF would add no value to the meeting. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Opposition to the G8 Global Partnership 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Mashkov claimed the G8 Global Partnership did not have a 
mandate that related to UNSCR 1540.  (Note:  This despite the G8 
Global Partnership's expressed mandate for assisting states with 
UNSCR 1540 implementation.  End note.)  He also questioned who would 
lead the organization's delegation at the Comprehensive Review. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Mashkov was strongly opposed to the participation of 
international organizations in the Comprehensive Review, repeatedly 
saying they would add no value to the meeting.  He turned down our 
suggestion that Russia talk to these entities regarding their 
interest in the Comprehensive Review before the GOR made a final 
decision on the matter.  Ambassador already raised the issue of 
UNSCR 1540 with MFA North America Director Igor Neverov, who claimed 
little knowledge of this matter.
