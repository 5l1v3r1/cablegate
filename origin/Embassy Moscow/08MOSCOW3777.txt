SUBJECT:  DUMA DEFENSE COMMITTEE FIRST DEPUTY CHAIR BABICH - MEETING 
 
WITH CODEL TAUSCHER 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  In a December 15 meeting with Representatives 
Ellen Tauscher, Loretta Sanchez, Rick Larsen, and Doug Lamborn, Duma 
Defense Committee, First Deputy Chair Mikhail Babich said that 
Russia had high expectations for the incoming Obama Administration. 
He welcomed the proposal for regular meetings between the House 
Armed Services Committee and the Duma Defense Committee starting 
next year, and asked to learn more about how the Congress oversaw 
the Department of Defense and other defense-related agencies.  He 
noted that the reported delay in deployment of a missile defense 
system to Poland and the Czech Republic was an opportunity to engage 
in dialogue, although he underlined that Russia perceived these 
sites as a NATO threat on Russia's borders.  Babich offered 
continued Russian assistance in countering Iran's nuclear program 
and in non-proliferation.  End summary. 
 
Welcoming the New Administration 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a December 15 meeting, Duma Defense Committee First 
Deputy Chair Mikhail Babich told Representative Ellen Tauscher 
(D-CA), Representative Loretta Sanchez (D-CA), Representative Rick 
Larsen (D-WA), and Representative Doug Lamborn (R-CO) that Russia 
had high expectations for the incoming administration, "we hope we 
can solve all of the problems, untie all the knots, and find a way 
out of the situation we are in."  The brief session focused on 
Representative Tauscher's proposed bilateral inter-parliamentary 
committee, opportunities for dialogue on missile defense, 
non-proliferation, and Iran. 
 
Legislative Dialogue 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Babich warmly welcomed Representative Tauscher's proposal 
for the formation of a bilateral inter-parliamentary committee 
between the House Armed Services Committee and the Duma Defense 
Committee.  Both he and Representative Tauscher agreed that planning 
should start for a series of meetings early next year. 
Representative Tauscher outlined a future Strategic Arms Reduction 
Treaty (START), non-proliferation, Iran, and weapons of mass 
destruction as topics the two committees could share ideas and 
experiences as legislators. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Duma Committee Deputy expressed an interest to learn 
from the Congress on how it implemented oversight of the Department 
of Defense and other defense-related agencies.  As Russia confronts 
two major reform initiatives -- reform of the military and of 
military industries -- Babich asked to share experiences on these 
topics.  In particular, he would be interested to learn how 
Congressional committees organized the work of expert communities in 
developing legislation. 
 
Missile Defense 
--------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Due to testing concerns, Representative Tauscher reported 
that there would be a delay in deployment of a missile defense (MD) 
system to Poland and the Czech Republic.  She told him, however, 
that the U.S. reserved the right to deploy defenses appropriate to 
respond to the threat posed by Iran and "other current and emergent 
threats."  Calling the approach of Representative Tauscher "smart" 
and "a very reasonable thing to do," Babich welcomed the time this 
delay allows for dialogue.  He cautioned that the idea for a third 
MD site was "not the best solution."  He countered that the 
agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic constituted a threat, 
as they represented the establishment of NATO infrastructure on 
Russia's border.  He also criticized the U.S. approach of pursuing 
activities, when Russia proposed initiatives. 
 
Proliferation and Iran 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) While recognizing U.S. concerns with Iran's nuclear 
program, Babich said that Russia is no less concerned, especially 
since they are "so close to us."  He stated that Russia understood 
"third tier" countries very well, and offered to work together to 
prevent proliferation.  "The desire of both sides to stop activities 
and sit and talk is a good sign," he said.
