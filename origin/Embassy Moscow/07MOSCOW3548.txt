¶1. (SBU) During a brief meeting on July 18, Rosneft Vice 
President for Finance and Investments Peter O'Brien (Amcit) 
told U/S Jeffery that corporate governance at Rosneft and 
other major Russian companies, while not yet up to Western 
standards, has improved dramatically over the past several 
years.  O'Brien cited his and other companies' desire to 
raise funds in international capital markets as the prime 
driver of transparency.  Regarding Rosneft's own unfulfilled 
attempt to raise 5 billion Euros, O'Brien said that Rosneft 
was not in a hurry and was unwilling to "pay any price," as 
it has 18 months to refinance its debt.  He said the timing 
of the latest round of fundraising was "unlucky," explaining 
that bond rates were rising as spreads were increasing, 
causing diminished appetite for debt such as Rosneft's. 
 
¶2. (SBU) O'Brien said the current Rosneft management team is 
focused on efficiency and adopting best practices to optimize 
the value of its current assets.  Longer-term, the company 
has ambitions of doing "big deals" using its own stock for 
financing.  He added that company leadership understands 
"what needs to be done" to increase the value of the stock in 
international markets, referring to improved management and 
governance reforms.
