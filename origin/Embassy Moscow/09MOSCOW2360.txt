SEIZURES 
 
REF: STATE 94922 
 
¶1.  (SBU) We delivered reftel points to MFA 4th CIS 
Department Deputy Director Alexei Dvinyanin September 14 -- 
Quad partners had been instructed to deliver the points 
separately.  Dvinyanin welcomed the U.S. engagement with 
Georgian authorities, and confirmed that the GOR had been 
weighing on the Abkhaz authorities -- both directly and 
through its "embassy" in Sukhumi -- not to exacerbate the 
situation.  The Abkhaz, he assured us, had no intention to 
"unilaterally repeat the pirate action." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Noting the latest Abkhaz Incident Prevention and 
Response Mechanism meeting had already discussed the ship 
seizures, Dvinyanin announced that the Abkhaz, not Russia, 
would "harshly" raise the issue again at the September 17 
Geneva Talks.  He invited the international community, 
especially the U.S., to raise its voice at that venue in 
opposition to Georgia's recent activities.
