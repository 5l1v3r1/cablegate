CARGO INSPECTION TECHNOLOGY 
 
Summary:  This cable describes the recent visit of Russian Customs 
officers to the US, May 16-23, for technical discussions and 
demonstrations of Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII)equipment.  The 
visit was hosted by the Office of International Affairs of 
US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) under the Export 
Controls and Related Border Security (EXBS) program.  End Summary 
 
1.(SBU) Seven Moscow-based Russian customs professionals, 
representing the logistical support, information technology, 
radiation technology, and international cooperation departments, 
visited the US cities of Washington, DC; Savannah, GA; and Buffalo, 
NY for an intensive week of consultations and field observations of 
equipment used to inspect cargo by means of x-ray and gamma-ray 
technology.  The EXBS Russia Advisor, EXBS Program Coordinator, and 
Program Manager from the CBP Office of International Affairs 
accompanied the delegation, providing program and logistical 
support. 
 
2.(SBU) Russian Customs has already purchased NII equipment and is 
in the process of installing it in border crossing points.  They had 
specifically requested the meetings and demonstrations in order to 
witness how the technology was deployed in actual working 
situations.  In Washington, DC, the delegation participated in a 
series of interactive meetings with CBP field officers experienced 
in the use of the US-manufactured VACIS and European-manufactured 
Smith-Heimann HCV scanning equipment.  Judging from the number of 
technical and financial questions asked, interest was keen, and the 
group came away with solid knowledge from CBP experts eager to share 
their experience. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The delegation next traveled to the port of Savannah, 
Georgia for a classroom introduction to the port and its NII 
equipment, followed by a visit to the port itself.  It should be 
noted that Savannah, Georgia and Buffalo, NY were chosen for the 
Customs visit because their geographic locations and equipment used 
at border control points most closely approximated climactic and 
technological conditions that could be expected across the vast land 
mass of Russia. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In Savannah, CBP specialists demonstrated several types of 
NII scanning equipment in various settings:  mounted on trucks; on 
specially designed chassis; on rails; as well as stationary 
scanners.  Seeing this equipment used in a live setting helped the 
Russian experts evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of each type 
of equipment. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The delegation's last stop was Buffalo, NY.  Experienced 
CBP field officers demonstrated NII scanning equipment and 
techniques, both on cargo and on passenger vehicles entering the US 
from Canada.  A classroom briefing also provided information of 
specific US-Canadian border protection issues. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Informal  conversations with the Russian delegation members 
during and at the end of the U.S. visit revealed an opinion shift 
away from European-manufactured equipment and in favor of movable 
rail-based gamma scanners manufactured by US companies.  Whether 
this change in focus will actually result in a change in Russian 
Customs Service equipment policy remains to be seen.  But what is 
clear is that the visit was a success, based on the level of 
enthusiasm shown by the officers.  Their leader even made a point of 
telling the CBP and EXBS program officers that they were very 
pleased with the extent of technical information provided, and with 
the ability to observe the equipment in actual use in the field. 
EXBS Russia looks forward to working with Russian Customs on 
follow-up activities, to possibly include operator training in the 
US and/or Russia.
