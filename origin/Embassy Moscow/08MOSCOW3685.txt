DIRECTOR-GENERAL ELECTION 
 
REF: STATE 130916 
 
We delivered reftel points on December 19 to the Executive 
Secretary of the MFA's Commission on UNESCO Affairs, Grigoriy 
Ordzhonikidze, who said that the GOR did not yet have a 
position on Egyptian Minister of Culture Frouk Hosni's 
candidacy for UNESCO Director-General.  He stressed that the 
GOR was still undecided as to whom to support for the 
position, despite the fact that Hosni had said in a public 
statement that Russia would support his candidacy. 
Ordzhonikidze said that the GOR understood that Lithuania and 
Bulgaria would be nominating candidates, and he looked 
forward to discussing with us the merits of these and other 
possible candidates in the coming year.
