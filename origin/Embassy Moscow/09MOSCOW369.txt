INTERLOCUTOR ON DRAFT MOU AND IA ON NUCLEAR AND RADIOACTIVE 
DETECTION COOPERATION 
 
REF:  A) State 125153 B) Moscow 03648 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  During a February 11 meeting with Vice President of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) Nikolay Laverov, EST counselor and 
staff inquired about the proposed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
and Implementing Agreement (IA) between the Department of Homeland 
Security and the RAS on cooperative research and development in the 
areas of radioactive and nuclear detection (ref B).  Laverov 
informed Emboffs that the RAS supports the MOU and IA in principle. 
However, RAS is not the best counterpart to Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) on this MOU because RAS is not a ministry.  He 
therefore forwarded the MOU and IA to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs with a request for its decision as to which agency or 
ministry would be a more appropriate Russian signatory to these 
agreements.  He offered his judgment that a more appropriate 
organizational counterpart to DHS might be the Federal Security 
Service (FSB) due to its "similar structures," just as the FSB has 
taken the lead in bilateral anti-terrorism cooperation.  Laverov 
also suggested that other governmental agencies, like RAS or 
Rosatom, might also participate in the process in some support 
capacity. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Laverov, as a member of the Science Council of the RF 
Security Council, offered to take the matter up personally with RF 
Security Council Deputy Secretary FSB Colonel-General Valentin 
Alekseyevich Sobolev.  Laverov explained that Sobolev was previously 
involved in U.S.-Russian anti-terrorism cooperation activities. 
Sobolev is a career KGB (now FSB) officer who was appointed First 
Deputy Director of the Federal Counter-intelligence Service in 1994 
and First Deputy Director of FSB in 1997.  In 2007, Sobolev was 
appointed Acting Secretary of the RF's Security Council after Sergey 
Ivanov left the post.
