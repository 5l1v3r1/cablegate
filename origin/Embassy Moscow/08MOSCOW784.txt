SUBJECT: MFA REFUSES TO DISCUSS DOD REPORT ON CHINA 
 
REF: STATE 20659 
 
(U) The Russian MFA refused to discuss reftel with us. 
Moscow DAO, however, passed reftel to Deputy Chief of MOD's 
Foreign Liaison Directorate (UVS) Colonel Vladimir 
Skorobogatov on March 11, and to Chief of MOD's UVS 
General-Major Viktor Chernov on March 18 during the 2 Plus 2 
talks.  The MOD officials seemed genuinely interested in the 
DOD report, but given the highly classified nature of 
Russia's assessment of Chinese military strategy and 
capabilities, we do not expect to receive a reply to our 
request for a discussion on this matter in the near future.
