SUBJECT: INVITATION TO GPOI G8 CLEARINGHOUSE DELIVERED TO 
RUSSIA 
 
REF: STATE 126989 
 
(U) We delivered reftel invitation to MFA Deputy Director for 
G8 issues Vasily Pospelov on September 14.  Pospelov 
expressed appreciation for the invitation and undertook to 
ascertain who would attend from the Russian side.  He noted, 
however, that given the recent changes in the Russian 
government, he doubted he would be able to provide the 
information on attendees by the September 21 response date. 
He said he would send us the information as soon as he 
obtained it.  He agreed to review the request for an oral 
presentation and a written summary of Russian PKO 
capacity-building activities regionally/worldwide.  He said 
that the U.S. had agreed at the last meeting to circulate a 
concept paper on TL support arrangements and inquired whether 
we had done so (request e-mailed to PM/PPA).
