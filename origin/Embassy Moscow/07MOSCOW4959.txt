REFTEL: USDOC 07475 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, MIREA 
State University, Moscow, Russia. The company is 
listed on BIS license application D377163 as the 
ultimate consignee of a manual probe station. These 
items are controlled for nuclear non-proliferation and 
anti-terrorism reasons under ECCN 3B992. The licensee 
is Elecsys LLC, 55 Dorrance St., Suite 202, 
Providence, RI 02903. 
 
¶3. On October 2, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of MIREA 
State University, 78, Pr. Vernadskovo, Moscow, Russia. 
The export control team met with Alexander Zaitsev 
Deputy Director of Educational-Scientific Association 
"Electronics," Anton Lisitsky, Senior Researcher, and 
Mikhail Belkin, Specialist. 
 
¶4. MIREA was founded in 1968 to prepare specialists in 
the radio electronics field.  The Institute has 16,000 
students in 11 faculties and over 100 departments. 
The staff consists of 16 full members, 300 higher 
doctoral degree holders, and 1000 PhD-level 
instructors.  The Microwave Electronics and Photonics 
Laboratory was founded last year with a grant from the 
Ministry of Education of the Russian Federation.  The 
laboratory will conduct primary research in the 
microwave field, including the use of focused ion beam 
systems with extremely short wavelengths.  The 
laboratory is purely for theoretical research and will 
conduct no commercial projects. 
 
¶5. The commodities in reftel will be utilized in the 
laboratory to measure noise levels on microwave 
amplifiers with optical controls.  Dr. Belkin will be 
the principal researcher using the equipment, and will 
be used only for academic research projects. The probe 
station will be installed in a "clean room" within a 
limited access area of the MIREA facility.  The 
laboratory is secured with cipher locks and an 
electronic alarm system.  As the laboratory contains 
very expensive equipment, the area is given a priority 
for security patrols provided at all times by a 
contract security service, and is limited to access by 
authorized research personnel only.  The Department 
has no weapons of mass destruction or missile 
technology research programs. 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post recommends MIREA State 
University, Moscow, Russia, as reliable recipients of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is requested 
that post be notified of final disposition of the 
application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
