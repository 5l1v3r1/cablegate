Â¶1. (SBU) On April 14, we passed reftel information on the June 2-4 
meeting in Tallinn of the Information Portal Advisory Committee of 
the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) to Deputy 
Director Oleg Rozhkov in the MFA's Department of Security and 
Disarmament Affairs (DVBR).  On April 16, we followed up with DVBR's 
Olga Kuznetsova.  Kuznetsova appreciated receiving the information 
and said she had already circulated it to the Russian interagency 
group working on GICNT.  She said it was not yet clear which GOR 
officials or agencies would participate in the Tallinn meeting, but 
that at least one Russian official would likely attend.
