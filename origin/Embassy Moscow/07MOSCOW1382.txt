INFOPULSE-UKRAINE, KIEV, UKRAINE, LICENSE NO. NLR 
 
REFTEL: USDOC 00695 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Infopulse-Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine. The company is 
listed on an NLR SED as the ultimate consignee of an 
oscilloscope, parts and accessories, ECCN 5B991 and 
EAR99. The licensee is Mindspeed Technologies, 4000 
Macarthur blvd., Newport Beach, CA 92660. 
 
¶3. On March 14, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with Mindspeed 
Technologies Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine. The export 
control team met with Yevgeny Novikov, Director. 
 
¶4. In November 2006, Infopulse Ukraine was split into 
two corporate entities, known as Infopulse Ukraine and 
Mindspeed Technologies Ukraine.  The Remote Design 
Center of Infopulse was transferred to the newly 
created Mindspeed Technologies Ukraine.  Infopulse 
still provides logistics services for Mindspeed 
Technologies Ukraine. 
 
¶5. Mindspeed Technologies Ukraine provides chip design 
services, research and development, and specialized 
software integration for Voice-Over-Internet Protocol 
(VoIP) products for its U.S. based partner, Mindspeed 
Technologies.  NOTE: according to the Mindspeed 
Technologies website, prior June 27, 2003, Mindspeed 
was a wholly owned subsidiary of Conexant Systems, 
Inc. Conexant was launched as an independent entity in 
January 1999 after Rockwell International Corporation 
spun off its Rockwell Semiconductor Systems business 
to stockholders.  Mindspeed designs, develops and 
sells semiconductor networking solutions for 
communications applications in enterprise, access, 
metropolitan, and wide-area networks. END NOTE.  The 
company employs 60 at its offices located in a 
corporate tower in Kyiv.  The company has no sales, no 
marketing responsibilities, and does not conduct 
exports. 
 
¶6. The equipment in reftel is used in the Remote 
Design Center of Mindspeed Technologies Ukraine.  The 
team observed the laboratories utilized by the Remote 
Design Center.  Due to the integration of the product 
into the equipment in the laboratory, the team was not 
able to verify a serial number for the Terradyne 
Hammer product referenced in the documentation.  The 
EAR99 commodities consisted of connectors and cables, 
and cannot be verified as they do not have identity 
plates or serial numbers. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Infopulse-Ukraine, 
Kiev, Ukraine as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. 
origin commodities.
