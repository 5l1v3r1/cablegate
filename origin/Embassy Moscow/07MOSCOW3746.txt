¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 1st 
Fire Brigade, Krasnoyarsk, Russia. The company is 
listed on BIS license application D376657 as the 
ultimate consignee of a thermal imaging camera, MSA 
Evolution 6200 photon vanadium oxide microbolometer 
thermal imaging camera. This item is controlled for 
national security and nuclear non-proliferation 
reasons under ECCN 6A003. The licensee is Mine Safety 
Appliances Company, 121 Gamma Drive, RIDC Industrial 
Park, Pittsburgh PA 15238. 
 
¶3. On July 25, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted a pre- 
license check at the offices of 1st Fire Brigade, 59 
Lenin St., Krasnoyarsk, Russia. The export control 
team met with Chief Oleg Romanov, Deputy Chief 
Vladimir Martyshkin, and Cadre Officer Sergey 
Dolzhenkov. 
 
¶4. The Brigade was founded in 1911, and is the oldest 
fire station in Krasnoyarsk.  The brigade is part of 
the Ministry of Emergency Situations (acronym EMERCOM) 
and is the primary fire suppression and rescue service 
for the 70,000 residents of the city of Krasnoyarsk. 
The brigade employs 70 firefighters and support staff. 
In the past 100 years the brigade has only had three 
firefighters killed in the line of duty, a record 
attributed to the high level of training and emphasis 
on safety that the brigade has always maintained. The 
company averages 2-5 calls for service a day, with 
significantly more calls during the winter months. In 
the past six months, the brigade has responded to 70 
working fires. 
 
¶5. The camera in reftel will be used in search and 
rescue operations during working fires.  Most fires in 
the district occur in the basements of old, wooden 
buildings, a significant hazard in evacuation of 
victims and search operations. The camera can also be 
utilized in overhaul operations to ensure that no hot 
spots or fires within walls were missed.  In addition, 
the camera is suitable for the investigation of 
suspicious fires, aiding in the identification of the 
seat of the fire as well as to find and document 
evidence. NOTE: A second camera was ordered as well 
for the use of the Sovietsky District Fire Training 
Laboratory, which is the regional training center and 
fire investigation laboratory for the city of 
Krasnoyarsk and surrounding towns. The primary use of 
this camera will be the investigation of fires, and in 
fire training operations.  END NOTE. 
 
¶6. 50 firefighters will be trained in the use of the 
camera.  All firefighters participate in a continuing 
education program.  Training is conducted at the 
beginning of every shift, and equipment is inventoried 
and checked daily.  The Commandant's office will be 
responsible for the camera, and will ensure the 
security of the camera.  The station is manned 24 
hours a day.  The camera will be stored with other 
valuable equipment in a locked cabinet in the 
commandant's office, adjacent to the apparatus floor. 
The office is locked when not occupied, and is 
protected with an electronic security system. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends 1st Fire Brigade, 
Krasnoyarsk, Russia, as a reliable recipient of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is requested 
that post be notified of final disposition of the 
application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
