SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: PRE-LICENSE CHECK: JSC NORTH WESTCOM, ST. 
PETERSBURG, RUSSIA, LICENSE NO. D363669 
 
REFTEL: USDOC 03095 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine the legitimacy 
and reliability of the end-user, JSC North Westcom, St. Petersburg, 
Russia. The company is listed on BIS license application D363669 as 
the ultimate consignee of a thermal imaging camera, model: 
FLK-TI55FT-20/54. These items are controlled for national security, 
nuclear non-proliferation reasons under ECCN 6A003. The licensee is 
Fluke Corporation, 6920 Seaway blvd., Everett, WA 98204. 
 
¶3. On May 30, 2007, Export Control Attach Donald Pearce and FSN 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested pre-license check at the 
offices of Joint Stock Company North Westcom (NWC), 13-H Chapaeva 
st., bld.2, St. Petersburg, Russia. The export control team met with 
Aleksander Zugrov, General Director. 
 
¶4. NWC was founded five years ago as a distributor of electronic 
testing equipment.  Currently the company is an official distributor 
of U.S. based Fluke Electronics and Acterna/JDSU, among other import 
and Russian brands.  NWC sells a full line of testing equipment, 
from simple voltmeters to thermal imaging.  The company works with 
its clients to develop the best solutions for testing and inspection 
equipment for a variety of industrial and communications 
applications. NWC has two locations in St. Petersburg, a retail 
showroom in the industrial sector, and the company headquarters on 
Chapeva where the meeting was held. 
 
¶5. With the requested equipment as noted in reftel, NWC is hoping to 
branch into a service provider role as well.  As a part of the NWC 
modernization program, NWC personnel plan on utilizing the camera to 
conduct non-destructive testing services and quality assurance 
inspections for a variety of industrial end users.  The demand for 
high quality electrical infrastructure to support modern 
technological systems and the proliferation of high-speed 
communications technology has opened a niche in the market for 
private property owners to inspect their own power delivery 
infrastructure.  In addition, NWC hopes to utilize the camera for 
sales demonstration purposes as well, for companies who do not 
outsource their testing. 
 
¶6. NWC will employ two specialists, who will utilize the camera on a 
contract basis as well as conduct sales demonstrations.  When not in 
use the camera will be locked in an equipment storage room at the 
company headquarters.  The team was shown the storage room, which 
has a reinforced inner door and gates across the steel external 
access door to the loading dock.  The office has 24x7 security as 
well as an electronic alarm system with motion detectors and 
cameras. 
 
¶7. Mr. Zugrov is familiar with U.S. and Russian export controls. 
NWC is only authorized by its U.S. distributors for sales within the 
Russian Federation, and the company does not export.  The company 
hopes to get orders for sales of thermal imaging cameras from 
electrical service providers, research institutes and heavy 
industries.  Mr. Zugrov mentioned that having the Russian Federation 
as his sales territory was large enough to ensure a profit. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends JSC North Westcom, St. 
Petersburg, Russia, as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities. It is requested that post be notified of final 
disposition of the application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS follow-up and 
statistical reporting.
