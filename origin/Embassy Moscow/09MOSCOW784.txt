¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Prist, Moscow, Russia. 
The company is listed on BIS license applications: NLR as the 
ultimate consignee of one c/w microwave counter with remote sensors 
and general purpose electronic equipment. These items are controlled 
for national security and anti-terrorism reasons under ECCN 3A002. 
The licensee is Matrix, Inc., 109 Bonaventura Drive, San Jose, CA 
¶95134. 
 
¶3. On March 25, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of Prist, 8/9, Ordjonikidze Street, 
Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with Alexander 
Dedyukhin, General Director and Victoria Dedyukhina, Chief of the 
Import Department. 
 
¶4. Prist is a closed joint stock company founded in 1994, 
specializing in test and measurement instruments.  Prist employs 72 
people at its Moscow facility.  Prist is one of the top 5 companies 
in its field in Russia and regularly attends trade shows to gain 
exposure and broaden its customer base.  Prist is in partnership 
with several U.S. companies in its field, including Fluke, Le Croy, 
Agilent Technology and Matrix.  Prist has brochures from all of 
these companies on display in its office. 
 
¶5. Alexander Dedyukhin, General Director for Prist told the export 
control team that Prist has purchased 4 to 5 microwave counters 
(Dedyukhin calls them frequency counters) from Matrix over the 
years, but he claims that the reftel commodity was not purchased by 
Prist.  A few days prior to this meeting, LES Shipitsina provided 
Prist with the reftel Matrix sales order (S.O.) no. SO08090053, when 
setting up the end use check.  Prist contacted Matrix to inquire 
about the S.O. and was told that that particular S.O., no. 
SO08090053, was not a Prist order at all.  Matrix informed Prist 
that the S.O. in reftel was actually for Northrop Grumman in the 
United States.  Dedyukhin provided the export control team with the 
email correspondence between Prist and Matrix regarding the reftel 
sales order that went to Northrop Grumman for the ECO files. 
 
¶6. Alexander Dedyukhin, General Director of Prist gave the export 
control team a tour of the Prist facilities where the export control 
team did see Matrix microwave counters and other U.S. origin 
technology being used in their testing and research lab. The export 
control team found no indications of impropriety at Prist, and 
DedyukhinQs answers were not evasive. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Prist, Moscow, Russia, as a 
reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
