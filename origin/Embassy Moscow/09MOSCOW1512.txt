SUBJECT:  EXBS RUSSIA MONTHLY REPORTING CABLE 
MAY 2009 
 
Summary:  This cable highlights activities of the Export Control and 
Related Border Security (EXBS) Russia Program Office for the period 
of May 01, 2009 to May 31, 2009.  End Summary 
 
¶1.  EXBS contractor Commonwealth Trading Partners (CTP) through its 
Russian partner, the Center for Export Controls (CEC), conducted 
export controls training in Kaliningrad May 5-6 for approximately 20 
Russian Customs inspectors.  Specialists from the Federal Service 
for Technical and Export Control (FSTEK), Customs, and CEC updated 
the audience on major Russian export controls laws and changes to 
those laws, as well as Russian government agencies' areas of 
responsibility in upholding export controls regulations.  The 
training consisted of two parts:  day one was devoted to Russian 
export rules and regulations; and day two consisted of hands-on 
computer work with the Product Identification tool (PIT).  This 
software has been used by Russian Customs as a supplemental aid in 
identifying and classifying commodities presented for export. 
Seminar participants successfully used the PIT tool in day-long 
exercises meant to simulate real-life situations. 
The Kaliningrad session is one in a series of PIT tools and export 
controls trainings conducted by CTP and CEC in various cities across 
Russia through June for regional Customs inspectors.  The last 
training in the series will occur in early June in Vladivostok. 
 
¶3.  EXBS is working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send at 
least three English-speaking Russian government delegates to the 
Tenth Annual Export Control Conference in Istanbul, Turkey June 
25-27.  This year's conference is jointly sponsored by the State 
Department-coordinated EXBS program and the government of Turkey. 
It will allow international export control experts to engage in 
discussion and debate regarding the state of export controls around 
the globe.  Specialists in strategic trade controls from 60 
countries and Taiwan have been invited to participate. 
 
¶4.  EXBS resolved an issue concerning 8 CT-30 kits which had been 
sent to the program in Russia.  The sets of tools designed to detect 
contraband materials in confined spaces were intended to help 
Russian Customs perform cargo inspections.  However, several 
factors, including the existence of Russian analog instruments, plus 
the effort required to certify them for use in Russia, proved to be 
a detriment to their being accepted by Russian Customs.  With the 
assistance of the Action Officer for Russia, the kits have found a 
permanent home at US posts in Guatemala and Belize. 
 
¶5.  EXBS Russia is pleased to announce that a recent event regarding 
Air Cargo Interdiction Training (IACIT) of Russian Customs by US 
Customs in New York was featured in Ambassador John Beyrle's 
electronic newsletter of May 1st.  The newsletter can be accessed

¶6.  On May 14, EXBS Advisor Joan Agerholm and EXBS Program 
Coordinator Konstantin Troyan met with the director of a prominent 
export controls training center in St. Petersburg to discuss 
possibilities for cooperation on EXBS-supported programs. 
 
¶7.  A delegation of seven Russian Customs officers visited the US 
May 16-23 for technical discussions and demonstrations of 
Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) equipment.  The visit was hosted by 
the Office of International Affairs of US Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) and supported by EXBS.  The group visited the 
cities of Washington, DC; Savannah, GA; and Buffalo, NY for an 
intensive week of consultations and field observations of equipment 
used to inspect cargo by means of x-ray and gamma-ray technology. 
The EXBS Russia Advisor, EXBS Program Coordinator, and Program 
Manager from the CBP Office of International Affairs accompanied the 
delegation, providing program and logistical support.  This visit is 
detailed in MRN 00001503 dated 06/09/2009. 
 
¶8.  (Comment):  Russian Customs had requested this visit as an aid 
to better understand the advantages and drawbacks of the deployed US 
equipment against the recent purchases of NII technology in Russia. 
Based on informal feedback from the Russian delegation, the visit 
was very successful in terms of the level and extent of technical 
information and hands-on demonstrations of the scanning equipment in 
a live setting.  There is even some indication that future equipment 
purchases will favor movable rail-based gamma scanners manufactured 
by US companies, as opposed to European-manufactured equipment.
