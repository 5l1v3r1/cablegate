AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  MFA North America Department Director Igor Neverov 
recently delivered to the DCM a nonpaper suggesting ways the 
U.S. and Russia, within the context of the Collective 
Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), can cooperate more 
closely in the fight against narco-trafficking in 
Afghanistan.  A copy of the original nonpaper in Russian has 
been faxed to EUR/RUS. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Begin text of nonpaper: 
 
Russia and the United States both understand that effective 
measures against the production and smuggling of drugs in 
Afghanistan have taken on a more critical importance in 
achieving larger goals such as defeating terrorism, 
establishing a stable authority in the country, and managing 
it economically.  We are pleased that our partners recognize 
increasingly the need to establish productive cooperation 
with Russia in this area. 
 
An excellent example is the launch of a pilot project within 
the framework of the NATO-Russia Council on training Afghan 
and Central Asian police officers to fight drug producers and 
smugglers.  That course is taught at the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs' training center in Domodedovo. 
 
An important element in countering the Afghan narco-threat is 
strengthening regional cooperation between Afghanistan and 
its neighbors, the urgency of which was stressed in the 
recently adopted London agreement on Afghanistan.  This 
cooperation could be implemented bilaterally as well as with 
the involvement of influential regional organizations, in 
particular, the Collective Security Treaty Organization 
(CSTO).  All CSTO member-states have expressed their 
willingness to provide multilateral assistance and support to 
Afghanistan including in such areas as fighting international 
terrorism, transborder drug-trafficking, organized crime and 
illegal immigration, the strengthening of  mutual borders, 
assistance for the development of regional trade and economic 
cooperation, humanitarian and other exchanges.  For these 
purposes within the CSTO framework a special working group on 
Afghanistan has been established.  A special significance in 
the context of international efforts to counter the 
production and spread of Afghan drugs is being created in the 
partnership between the international organizations and 
multilateral structures involved in this area, on the one 
hand, and CSTO, which is already actively involved in this 
work.  As an example, the counter-narcotics operation, 
Channel, which has been implemented by the CSTO, is becoming 
increasingly efficient and every year a larger number of 
nations join this operation.  We don't see any obstacles if 
NATO members including the U.S. would like to join it 
(initially, possibly, as observers). 
 
We are convinced that the establishment of cooperation on 
Afghanistan between CSTO on the one hand and NATO and the 
international security forces on the other hand could help to 
transform Afghanistan's northern borders into a secure fence 
protected from terrorism, drug trafficking, and organized 
crime, while at the same time providing "transparency" for 
legal trade and all the forms of regional cooperation.  We 
are ready to discuss possible specific directions and forms 
of that cooperation. 
 
End text of nonpaper.
