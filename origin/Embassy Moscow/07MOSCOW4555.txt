REFTEL: USDOC 08142 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Moscow 
Railways, Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS 
license application D382505 as the ultimate consignee 
of a photon camera. These items are controlled for 
national security and nuclear non-proliferation 
reasons under ECCN 6A003. The licensee is Indigo 
Systems Corporation, 70 Castilian Dr., Goleta, CA 
¶93117. 
 
¶3. On September 13, 2007, Export Control Attache 
Donald Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of Moscow 
Railway (MR), 20, Krasnoprudnaya st., Moscow, Russia. 
The export control team met with Aleksandr Vasilego, 
Chief Engineer, Cargo Service of Moscow Railway. 
 
¶4. MR was founded in the 1880s to provide rail service 
between Moscow and cities in the Central Region of 
Russia.  In 1957 the railroad companies were 
consolidated, and today MR is one of seventeen 
railroad companies under the Russian Railroads system 
(Russian abbreviation RZhD).  MR carries the largest 
amount of passengers of the RZhD system and is the 
fourth largest cargo rail line, equivalent in size to 
U.S. railway company CSX.  MR has 500 passenger and 
cargo stations and terminals, and employs over 
130,000. 
 
¶5. The Cargo Services branch operates two cargo hub 
stations, located in suburban Moscow and in the town 
of Ryazan, 196 km to the southeast of Moscow. Mr. 
Vasilego states that MR has ordered two cameras. 
NOTE: Reftel indicates an application for three 
cameras.  Mr. Vasilego stated that, depending on 
performance and funding he may order more cameras for 
use in other cargo terminals, but currently MR will 
only purchase two imagers.  END NOTE. 
 
¶6. The thermal imagers in reftel will be used in the 
cargo sorting stations, affixed permanently in the 
central area of the rail yard, to examine unladed 
cars.  These examinations are conducted to ensure that 
commodities such as cement, flour, or other powders or 
granular substances have been completely off-loaded. 
Residual powders left in the cars can present a 
hazard, and the thermal imagers will make inspection 
of the cars more efficient and accurate.  Specialists 
from Alfa Pribor, the intermediate consignee, will 
install and maintain the camera system.  A total of 
eight specialists at each station will have access to 
the system, which will be employed around the clock. 
 
¶7. A specialized Railroad Police unit of the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs (Russian abbreviation MVD) 
Militsia provides security at MR facilities around the 
clock.  NOTE:  MVD Militsia are the primary local law 
enforcement units in the Russian Federation.  END 
NOTE.  In addition to regular patrols, the stations 
are monitored by closed-circuit television.  An 
additional layer of protection will come from the 
specialists themselves, as the units will be utilized 
around the clock.  Should a camera go off-line, the 
operator will be able to visually verify that the 
camera is still in place. 
 
¶5. Recommendations: Post recommends Moscow Railway, 
Moscow, Russia, as reliable recipients of sensitive 
U.S. origin commodities. It is requested that post be 
notified of final disposition of the application, and 
of any shipments for this organization in order to 
conduct appropriate FCS follow-up and statistical 
reporting.
