Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) In an April 14 meeting with the Ambassador, 
ConocoPhillips Chairman and CEO Jim Mulva (strictly protect) 
said his company's alliance with Lukoil is going well and 
that ConocoPhillips is likely to join Lukoil in bidding on 
the West Qurna field in Iraq.  He said ConocoPhillips is 
interested in further strategic opportunities in Russia. 
They have been discussing possible projects with Gazprom, 
which in turn is interested in selling LNG to the U.S. market 
and expanding internationally.  Mulva said Deputy Prime 
Minister Igor Sechin separately indicated to him an interest 
in having ConocoPhillips expand its presence in Russia. 
Mulva described Sechin as "gracious" and eager to do business 
with his company.  Lukoil CEO Vagit Alekperov, however, had 
warned Mulva to be wary of Sechin.  While Alekperov's caution 
may be justified, we believe Sechin's overture offers at 
least some indication that the GOR's attitude toward the 
U.S., and U.S. companies, is indeed shifting for the better. 
End summary. 
 
-------------- 
Lukoil in Iraq 
-------------- 
 
¶2. (C) Mulva told the Ambassador that ConocoPhillips would 
likely join Lukoil "and other companies" in a consortium to 
bid on the West Qurna field in Iraq.  He said Lukoil is 
interested in getting its Saddam-era contract on West Qurna 
restored, "under new terms" acceptable to the Iraqis.  He 
said Prime Minister Maliki's recent visit to Moscow yielded 
some positive indications that the government of Iraq may be 
open to the idea, perhaps tying it to further debt relief. 
According to Mulva, PM Putin is willing to offer debt relief, 
but only if Lukoil can get back into West Qurna. 
 
¶3. (C) Mulva said that in general ConocoPhillips is 
interested in doing business with Russian companies 
internationally.  However, he said Russian companies are 
poorly received abroad due to the GOR's heavy-handed approach 
to international business.  According to Mulva, Lukoil's CEO 
Vagit Alekperov, with whom he has developed a strong personal 
relationship, has figured this out.  However, he is an 
exception among senior Russian businessmen in the sector. 
 
-------------------------- 
OPPORTUNITIES WITH GAZPROM 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Mulva said one company with whom ConocoPhillips has 
been discussing joint projects internationally for some time 
is Gazprom.  He had met earlier that day with Gazprom CEO 
Aleksey Miller and had told him that ConocoPhillips could 
help Gazprom expand internationally but that it would need 
access to some "strategic asset" in Russia in return.  Mulva 
noted, however, that Alekperov had told him it was unlikely 
that the GOR would issue any new licenses for strategic 
fields in 2009, given the low price of oil. 
 
¶5. (C) Mulva said one option for Gazprom might be to buy 
ConocoPhillips's assets in Venezuela, where, he said, his 
company is "holding its own" but is mired in legal challenges 
to expropriation actions by the government of Venezuela.  He 
said this idea is "making the circles" in the GOR.  Another 
option is for ConocoPhillips to sell Gazprom its assets in 
Nigeria, which he described as "a basket case" that 
ConocoPhillips would prefer to get out of. 
 
¶6. (C) Mulva said Gazprom has a long-term interest in selling 
gas to the U.S. market.  He said Gazprom realizes the 
political complications of owning assets in the U.S., and is 
instead looking for partners to help it sell LNG in the U.S. 
market.  To that end, Miller suggested the possibility of 
ConocoPhillips helping Gazprom develop gas fields in the 
Yamal peninsula from which to eventually supply LNG to the 
U.S.  However, Mulva said the geography of Yamal was not 
currently conducive to LNG shipments, given that the region 
is ice-bound much of the year. 
 
¶7. (C) Mulva said the strategic asset in Russia in which 
ConocoPhillips is most interested is the Trebs and Titov 
deposits in Northwest Russia, near where ConocoPhillips and 
Lukoil already have a project.  The fields, which may hold 1 
billion barrels of oil, could be easily linked to the 
infrastructure the two companies have already developed in 
the area. 
 
¶8. (C) Mulva said Gazprom's oil subsidiary, Gazpromneft, 
could join the consortium and might be able to help overcome 
the GOR's designation of the filed as "strategic," which is a 
complicating factor for ConocoPhillips's potential 
involvement.  He said Miller told him that Gazprom is not 
opposed to ConocoPhillips becoming a partner in this 
development, but that Gazprom will want 51% control. 
 
------ 
SECHIN 
------ 
 
¶9. (C) Mulva said he also met with DPM Sechin earlier that 
day, his second meeting with Sechin this year.  He said 
Sechin had enthusiastically welcomed ConocoPhillips 
investments in Russia.  Mulva and Don Wallette, 
ConocoPhillips's Russia and Caspian President, both portrayed 
Sechin as exceedingly gracious, charming, and eager to do 
business with ConocoPhillips.  At their first meeting Sechin 
had them meet with most of the major Russian players in the 
oil sector. 
 
¶10. (C) Mulva and Wallette said Sechin had accepted in 
principle the idea of an international consortium possibly 
bidding on Trebs and Titov licenses.  However, Mulva said a 
complicating factor was the rumored animosity between Miller 
and Sechin, given that Sechin controls energy policy in 
Russia and could block the license.  Sechin might be more 
interested in having ConocoPhillips join forces with 
state-owned Rosneft, of which Sechin is chairman, rather than 
with Gazprom. 
 
¶11. (C) In that regard, Mulva said he was wary of doing 
business with Sechin.  Alekperov had warned him to "be very 
careful" in dealing with Sechin.  According to Mulva, 
Alekperov said that Sechin is only interested in "being the 
gatekeeper" for all information about the oil and gas sector 
and would try to use ConocoPhillips without offering anything 
of value in return.  The Ambassador noted in response that 
Sechin's real expertise lay in gathering information and 
agreed that Alekperov's warning should be taken seriously. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶12. (C) Sechin's overtures to ConocoPhillips would appear to 
be further evidence that the warming trend in bilateral 
relations has reached the energy sector, following the recent 
approval of ExxonMobil's operating budget for Sakhalin 1.  It 
may also be indicative of a renewed realization on the part 
of some key GOR officials that Russia needs Western 
investment and know-how in the oil and gas sector if its 
hopes to remain at the top of the energy game.  While we 
welcome this apparent warming toward U.S. companies, we are 
waiting to see it translated into concrete actions.
