REFTEL: USDOC 07710 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, LLC 
Nordix, Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS 
license application D380382 as the ultimate consignee 
of polyimide apical film type. These items are 
controlled for national security and anti-terrorism 
reasons under ECCN 1C008. The licensee is Mitsui and 
Co (USA) Inc., 200 Park Ave, New York, NY 10017. 
 
¶3. On September 5, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of LLC 
Nordix, which are located at the OOO Borets factory, 6 
Skladochnaya St., Moscow, Russia. The export control 
team met with Victoria Dinavetskaya, General Director 
of LLC Nordix and Vladislav Kondratiev, Deputy General 
Director of Closed Joint Stock Company (Russian 
abbreviation OOO) Borets. 
 
¶4. LLC Nordix was founded five years ago as an 
importer of equipment for the oil and gas industry. 
The company specializes in sourcing and delivery of 
materials and equipment from the United States and 
Europe.  The company employs seven at two Moscow 
locations.  The main office, located on Leningradsky 
Prospekt in the city center, is currently under 
renovation.  All operations are temporarily being 
housed at the satellite office located at OOO Borets, 
in the northern section of Moscow.  Nordix is acting 
in the capacity of an intermediate consignee in the 
transaction described in reftel, with the ultimate end 
user being OOO Borets. 
 
¶5. OOO Borets was founded 119 years ago to produce 
pumping and compressor equipment. Today OOO Borets is 
a limited liability holding company producing electric 
submersible pump equipment and control systems for the 
oil and gas sector.  The company employs 30,000 at six 
factories in Russia and one oil field services center 
located in Siberia.  30% of OOO Borets stock is held 
by the Weatherford Oil Field Services of the United 
States, with the remainder in the hands of private 
investors. 
 
¶6. The commodities in reftel will be used in the 
shielding of motor wires, produced by OOO Borets in a 
cable factory located in Tomilino, a town located 
seven kilometers outside of Moscow.  The film will be 
used to shield pump control cables, which will then be 
installed in the pipes of submersible oil pump 
systems, which will be used in oil field operations. 
Mr. Kondratiev stated that, depending on price and 
demand for the products, approximately 20 tons of the 
polymide apical film will be imported.  For three 
years, OOO Borets imported polymide apical film from 
DuPont, but recently switched to Mitsui based on price 
point; Both DuPont and Mitsui produce high-quality 
film. 
 
¶7. The materials will be stored in the factory 
warehouse, which is guarded at all times by Borets own 
security service.  The cables will then be shipped to 
the OOO Borets factory in Moscow for installation into 
the pipes.  Each pump system has three sections, with 
200 meters of wire required for each section.  Upon 
installation the completed systems are sent to the 
client. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends LLC Nordix and OOO 
Borets, Moscow, Russia, as reliable recipients of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is requested 
that post be notified of final disposition of the 
application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
