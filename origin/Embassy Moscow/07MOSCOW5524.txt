REF: STATE 159386 
 
(SBU) We delivered reftel points on November 23 to MFA Deputy 
Director for the Middle East and North Africa Oleg Ozerov and 
urged Russia to change its abstentions to "no" votes this 
year.  Ozerov cited the GOR practice of abstaining on 
anti-Israel resolutions at UNGA and said that to begin 
opposing the resolutions at this time would appear 
inconsistent.  He explained that the GOR preferred that UNGA 
resolutions dealing with the Middle East contain "less 
rhetoric, less focus on Israel," but noted that these 
resolutions have a "history that is very difficult to 
change."  Many are drafted by the Palestinians, who have seen 
their economic situation deteriorate over the last two years 
while Israel's security situation has improved.  Ozerov said 
that should the situation improve for the Palestinians the 
GOR and other governments could change their positions on 
anti-Israel resolutions.
