¶2. Reftel requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia. The 
company is listed on BIS license application D394421 
as the ultimate consignee of one (1) intensified 
electronic imaging camera using a cooled, slow-scan 
CCD coupled to a filmless image intensifier tube model 
no. V7090D, V9569D. These items are controlled for 
national security (NS) anti-terrorism (AT), regional 
stability (RS), and nuclear proliferation (NP) reasons 
under ECCN 6A003. The licensee is Princeton

Dr. Victor Timoshenko, director of the Physics 
Department and Associate Professor Dr. Denis Zhigynov. 
 
¶4. ECO Liston met with Professors Timoshenko and 
Zhigynov at their office and was then taken to a lab 
where the intensified electronic imaging camera using 
a cooled, slow-scan CCD coupled to a filmless image 
intensifier tube model no. V7090D, V9569D was secured 
and used for research.  Both Timoshenko and Zhigynov 
described the operational applications of the subject 
commodity.  Timoshenko advised the ECO that his lab 
has two earlier generations of similar equipment, one 
from Japan and one the other from Germany, which were 
still in use and in the same lab.  He stated that the 
Princeton Instruments Inc.'s intensified electronic 
imaging camera using a cooled, slow-scan CCD coupled 
to a filmless image intensifier tube model no. V7090D, 
V9569D was more advanced and is cable of measuring 
spectra with time resolution, which the previous 
generations were not. 
 
¶5. The ECO inspected the subject commodity and noted 
the serial numbers: serial no. 25580665 for the 
intensifier, and serial no. 1707080009 for the CCD 
camera.  The equipment is being used for the end-use 
for which it was licensed for, that is strictly 
civilian scientific research, and there are no 
indications of impropriety. 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post recommends Moscow State 
University, Moscow, Russia as a reliable recipient of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
