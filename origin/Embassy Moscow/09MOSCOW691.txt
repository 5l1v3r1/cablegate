SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED:  SEEKING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT 
FOR AMISOM AND THE SOMALIA SECURITY SECTOR 
 
REF: STATE 24665 
 
¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche on March 20 to MFA 
section chief for Somalia Valeriy Shibeko, who said that 
Russia shared the U.S. hope that the election of Sheikh 
Sharif as President of the TFG offered an opportunity for 
progress, but cautioned against being overly optimistic as 
Somalia was still a long war from stability.  He cited the 
fact that not all opposition groups had entered into talks 
with the TFG, and that armed factions and warlords were still 
active as the cause for continued concern.  Moreover, AMISOM 
has only established security in Mogadishu. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Shibeko took note of the U.S. aid contributions to 
Somalia and AMISOM, then reminded us that the GOR had donated 
$1 million in 2008 to the World Food Program to supply flour 
to Somalia and provided scholarships to Somali students to 
study in Russia.  He could not specify any future aid that 
the GOR might provide to Somalia or AMISOM. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Stating that it was Russian policy to take part in 
all UN peacekeeping operations in Africa, Shibeko told us 
that Russia was likely to contribute resources to the UN 
peacekeeping operation slated to take over from AMISOM later 
this year.  Even though this entailed the African Union 
troops already in Somalia simply changing to blue helmets, 
the fact that this would become a UN operation would provide 
an opportunity for Russian participation.  Shibeko thought it 
possible that Russia would provide helicopters to the Somalia 
mission, as it was already doing in Darfur.
