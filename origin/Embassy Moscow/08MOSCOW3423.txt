REF:  STATE 123480 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) We shared reftel talking points regarding the proposed 
Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food (GPAF) with GOR 
officials in the MFA's International Organizations Department and in 
the International Relations Departments of the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Ministry of Health and Social Development, and the 
Federal Service for Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-Being 
(Rospotrebnadzor).  On November 24, Grigoriy Ustinov, a second 
secretary in the MFA's International Organizations Department, 
advised us that the MFA had also shared the GPAF talking points with 
the Ministry of Finance.  He noted that the GOR was not yet prepared 
to provide a substantive reaction to the proposed GPAF, as GOR 
ministries were still reviewing the document.  We will continue to 
follow up with the relevant ministries and report any substantive 
response.
