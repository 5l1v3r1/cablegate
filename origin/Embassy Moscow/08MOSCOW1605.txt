SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On June 4 we reviewed with Olga Kuznetsova, MFA 
Department for Security and Disarmament Affairs, actions (ref) to 
invite countries to make presentations at the June 16 - 18 GICNT 
Madrid conference.  Kuznetsova noted she had already discussed the 
approaches with Washington, and that Russian Embassies in Ankara, 
Valletta, Manama and Abu Dhabi, in coordination with U.S. Embassies 
in these countries, had already delivered the demarche.  She added, 
however, that Russian Embassies in the other countries listed reftel 
would not have time to deliver the message. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Kuznetsova mentioned two related issues that she said she 
had also raised with the Department.  The first was a request for 
USG assistance to encourage Spain to provide Russia with the 
technical equipment necessary for interpretation during the Madrid 
meetings.  The GOS told the GOR that it had limited resources and 
could not support the request.  Kuznetsova added that the GOR was 
willing to pay the entire cost. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Kuznetsova also sought USG support for the GOR's request 
to the IAEA to send a Deputy Director General level attendee to 
Madrid.  The IAEA has an important role in countering nuclear 
terrorism and this level of observer would send a clear message to 
all GICNT partners.
