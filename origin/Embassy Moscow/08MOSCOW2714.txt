¶1. (C) Following recent comments by Kremlin Foreign Policy 
Advisor Prihodko and DFM Karasin to the Ambassador expressing 
concern over the security implications of political 
instability in Pakistan, we met with MFA Senior Counselor for 
Pakistan Aleksey Yudintsev on September 9, and stressed that 
Musharraf's resignation did not affect the security of 
Pakistan's nuclear weapons, which remain under military 
control (refs A and B). 
 
¶2. (C) Yudintsev reiterated Russian concern that the 
political turmoil surrounding the Musharraf resignation drew 
attention from Pakistan's effort to fight its extremist 
insurgency (ref C).  While the September 6 election of Zarif 
Zardari as President would temporarily calm the situation, 
Yudintsev predicted that by the end of the year, tensions 
between Zardari and Nawaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan 
Muslim League-Nawaz, would cause the current government to 
collapse.  The popular Sharif would likely become the next 
PM, opening up the possibility of continued political turmoil 
unless the two leaders could reach an understanding on 
addressing Pakistan's pressing security and economic problems. 
 
¶3. (C) Yudintsev told us that the GOR hoped to get a better 
picture of the situation in Pakistan when a Russian 
delegation heads to Islamabad in October for a meeting of the 
bilateral Working Group on Terrorism.  This would be the 
fourth meeting of the group, which was supposed to convene 
annually but last met in Moscow in June 2006.  Yudintsev 
explained that the GOR wanted to improve communication 
regarding each country's counter-terrorism efforts, and would 
seek an explanation of the Pakistani government's plan to 
fight extremists.  Moscow has been disappointed in 
Islamabad's failure to respond to requests for information on 
suspected Chechen extremists training and operating in 
Pakistan's tribal areas, and would use the meeting to improve 
information sharing.  Yudintsev said that there were no plans 
to discuss Russian security assistance to Pakistan.
