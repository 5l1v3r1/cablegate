¶1. (SBU)  On May 3 poloff delivered reftel demarche to MFA 
Legal Department Acting Director Vladimir Tarabrin.  Tarabrin 
said the GOR continues to support the Third Additional 
Protocol and will support the statutory amendments to the Red 
Cross and Red Crescent Movement at the conference in Geneva 
June 20-21.  Russia wants the movement to be universal, he 
continued, and all National Societies should be given the 
opportunity to participate.  He regretted that some counties 
had politicized fundamentally humanitarian issues. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The GOR has not yet signed the Third Additional 
Protocol, which is under review through an inter-Agency 
process.  Tarabrin said it was unlikely the Duma would ratify 
the Protocol before the June conference.
