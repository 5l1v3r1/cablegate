¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 
Rostovskiy NII Radiosvyazi, Rostov-on-Don, Russia. The 
company is listed on BIS license application D380295 
as the ultimate consignee of a 2-67 GHZ synthesizer 
and analog modulation suite. These items are 
controlled for national security reasons under ECCN 
3A002. The licensee is Anritsu Company, 490 Jarvis 
Drive, Morgan Hill, CA 95037. 
 
¶3. Upon receipt of REFTEL Post Moscow FSN Natalya 
Shipitsina contacted Valery Komor, Deputy Director, 
Rostovskiy NII Radiosvyazi, who stated that the 
organization had not yet decided to purchase the 2-67 
GHZ Synthesizer and analog modulation suite.  FSN 
Shipitsina agreed to contact Komor every two weeks for 
an update.  On November 2, 2007 Komor advised FSN 
Shipitsina that he was prepared to meet with Post 
Moscow during the week of November 14.  On November 8, 
2007 FSN Shipitsina spoke with Komor and Alexander 
Zhdanov, Chief Metrologist for Rostovskiy NII 
Radiosvyazi at which time Komor advised FSN Shipitsina 
that they had decided not to purchase the equipment 
and therefore do not want to meet with Post Moscow. 
 
¶4. Recommendations: Post can not recommend Rostovskiy 
NII Radiosvyazi, Rostov-on-Don, Russia, as reliable 
recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
