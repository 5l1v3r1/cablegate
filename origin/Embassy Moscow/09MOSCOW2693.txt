SUBJECT: GOR RESPONSE TO CHILD LABOR LISTS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 92560 
 
¶1. (U) Per reftel, on September 9 Post delivered a demarche 
to Nikolai Smirnov, Deputy Director of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs' 
North America Department, on the release of the Department of 
Labor's list of goods from countries that the Bureau of 
International Labor Affairs has reason to believe are 
produced by forced labor or child labor in violation of 
international standards; the proposed update to the 2001 list 
of products that might have been mined, produced, or 
manufactured by forced or indentured child labor; and the 
2008 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. 
 
¶2. (U) On October 23, we received the following written 
response from Smirnov: 
 
With regard to your letter from September 9 concerning the 
preliminary publication by the Department of Labor of the 
annual report on the use of forced labor and child labor in 
different countries and the inclusion of Russia on the list 
of such countries because of child pornography production, I 
would like to communicate the following information: 
 
In the Russian legal system, child pornography is not 
considered in terms of an economic category (in terms of a 
good), but is a result of criminally liable action.  The use 
of children to prepare pornographic products is not "child 
labor," that is, an allowed form of children's economic 
activity, but rather a crime against minors.
