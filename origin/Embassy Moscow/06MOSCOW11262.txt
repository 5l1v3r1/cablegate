SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: PRE-LICENSE CHECK: 
ELEKTRONEFTEMASH, MOSCOW, RUSSIA, LICENSE NO. D363343 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 
Elektroneftemash, Moscow, Russia. The company is 
listed on BIS license application D363343 as the 
ultimate consignee of apical type polymide film. These 
items are controlled for national security reasons 
under ECCN 1C008. The licensee is Mitsui and Co. Inc., 
200 Park Avenue 31st floor, New York, NY 10166. 
 
¶3. On October 2, 2006, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of 
Elektroneftemash (ENM), 12, Krasnokazarmennaya st., 
Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with 
Mikhail A. Karakhanyan, General Director. 
 
¶4. ENM was founded in 2000 to conduct scientific 
research and production of specialized electrical 
equipment for use in the oil and gas industry.  The 
company was established by a group of specialists with 
25 to 30 years of experience in the field.  The 
company is co-located with the oldest "All-Russian 
Electro technical Center" in Russia.  ENM employs 57, 
and last year showed profits of 5,000,000 USD.  The 
company is also involved in electro technical research 
projects, with a PhD-level researcher and five 
candidates for PhD level degrees on staff. 
 
¶5. ENM specializes in the production of coil wire, 
Teflon tubing and connectors for use in 
electromechanical pumps used in oil and gas drilling 
and extraction.  The company produces 250 tons per 
year of the copper coil wire, which accounts for a 
third of the Russian market for the wire.  In 
addition, it has half the Russian market for Teflon 
tubing.  The cables, tubes and connectors are specific 
to the types of pumps used in Russian equipment, which 
is built for use in cold climates. 
 
¶6. The polymide film in reftel will be used as the 
insulator for the copper coil wire.  Although there is 
one manufacturer of polymide film in Russia, the 
quality is not high enough for use in the extreme 
conditions found in oil and gas extraction operations. 
The company meets regularly with its foreign suppliers 
to discuss projects and supply requests.  The coil 
wires have no dual uses, and are specific to the 
Russian system.  This type of pump is not used 
anywhere outside of Russia. ENM does not export, and 
has no foreign customers. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Elekrtoneftemash, 
Moscow, Russia, as reliable recipients of sensitive 
U.S. origin commodities. It is requested that post be 
notified of final disposition of the application, and 
of any shipments for this organization in order to 
conduct appropriate FCS follow-up and statistical 
reporting.
