¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Elvatech Ltd, Kiev, Ukraine. The company is 
listed on a Shipper's Export Declaration as the 
ultimate consignee of ionizing radiations detectors, 
instrument and apparatus for measuring-ECCN 0x000 - no 
license required. The exporter is Amtek Inc., 14 De 
Angelo Drive, Bedford, MA 01730-2204. 
 
¶3. On March 13, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with Elvatech 
Ltd, Kiev, Ukraine. The export control team met with 
Alexander Filippov, Director and Viktor Martyniuk, 
Deputy Director. 
 
¶4. Elvatech was founded in 1991 as a manufacturer of 
analytical devices.  The company specializes in x-ray 
spectrometers for determination of the composition of 
samples.  The company sells to a wide variety of 
metallurgical and industrial clients in Russia, 
Europe, Korea and the United States.  Elvatech employs 
15 at its office and shop, rented from a factory 
located in the industrial section of Kyiv.  Elvatech 
is privately held, and incorporated as a closed joint- 
stock company. 
 
¶5. The detectors in reftel are used in the fabrication 
of the x-ray spectrometer.  The detectors are stored 
in a bin in the fabrication area of the workshop.  The 
team was able to observe serial numbers 41004, 41008, 
and 41011.  Other devices have been installed in 
detectors.  As orders are filled, the detectors are 
added to the bin.  As there is no need to account for 
each detector, there are no records as to which device 
any specific detector is installed in. 
 
¶6. The landlord provides around the clock security at 
the facility.  The factory, a former military 
operation, currently produces gas meters for utilities 
providers.  The offices and production areas have 
cipher locks on the doors, and only employees have 
access to the production facility. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Elvatech Ltd, 
Kiev, Ukraine as reliable recipients of U.S. origin 
commodities.
