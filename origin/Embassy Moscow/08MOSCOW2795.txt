Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Radel Ltd, 20 Novaya Basmannaya St., Moscow, 
Russia. The company is listed on BIS license 
application: NLR as the ultimate consignee of fifteen

¶3. On September 16, 2008, Export Control Attach Peter 
Liston conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification with Radel Ltd, of 20 Novaya Basmannaya 
St., Moscow, Russia. The PSV was conducted at the 
office of ProExCom, 14 Prospect Kutuzova, Suite 34, 
Moscow, Russia.  The Export Control Attach met with 
Vladimir Davidenko, Section Head with Radel Ltd, and 
Igor Samusev, General Director of ProExCom. 
 
¶4. Radel Ltd., is a wholly own Russian company 
established approximately 12 years ago and has almost 
80 employees.  Vladimir Davidenko has been with Radel 
Ltd just over one year.  Davidenko stated that Radel 
Ltd's primary line of business is the sale of 
electronics equipment to the Russian market.  ProExCom 
is an importer of electronic equipment for the Russian 
market. 
 
 
¶5. Davidenko stated that a little more than two years 
ago Radel Ltd received an order from the Russian 
Ministry for Emergency Situations, MES, for 
communications equipment that could link their 
emergency vehicles and rescue teams together.  Radel 
Ltd, through ProExCom, purchased the subject commodity 
from Triquint Semiconductor of Texas.  The equipment 
was received 2 years ago and immediately placed in 
operation without problems.  The subject commodity was 
therefore not available for inspection to the ECO. 
 
¶6. Both Davidenko of Radel Ltd and Samusev of ProExCom 
were knowledgeable of the subject commodity, answered 
all of the ECO questions and showed no signs of 
impropriety. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Radel Ltd, 20 
Novaya Basmannaya St., Moscow, Russia as reliable 
recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
