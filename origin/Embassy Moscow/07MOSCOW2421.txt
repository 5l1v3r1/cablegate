¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Ministry of Culture Deputy Director for 
the Preservation of Cultural Artifacts Yuri Godovanets told 
us on May 17 that review of art restitution cases are at a 
standstill until Presidential Decree number 320, which 
transfers responsibility over restitution to MinCulture's 
Department of Legal Affairs and International Relations, is 
implemented by mid-June. End summary. 
. 
¶2. (SBU)  Per reftel, Econoff had delivered the Drey Art 
claim on March 21 to both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
the MinCulture.  Econoff coordinated with British emboffs who 
delivered the identical claim to the MFA.  British emboffs 
told us that Godovanets refused to accept their copy of the 
Drey claim destined for MinCulture and said that the MFA copy 
should suffice. 
. 
¶3. (SBU)  Econoff met with Godovanets on May 17 to discuss 
this and the Goya painting restitution case.  He said that 
his agency, the Federal Service for Monitoring Legal Matters 
for Mass Communication and Preservation of Cultural Artifacts 
(Rossokhrankultura), is currently undergoing reorganization 
ordered by Presidential Decree no. 320 signed on March 12 and 
he would no longer be the point of contact for restitution 
cases. His service will now report directly to PM Fradkov and 
work more closely on intellectual property issues. He told us 
the new point of contact is Vladimir Viktorovich Karyakin in 
the Department of Legal Affairs and International Relations 
at MinCulture.  Reorganization needs to be completed within 
90 days of the decree's signing.
