Â¶1. (SBU) On June 25, we passed reftel information on polio 
eradication and vaccination in Nigeria to Alexander Zakharov, 
Counselor and Director of the Bilateral Relations Section of the 
MFA's North America Department, and to Vasiliy Pospelov, Deputy 
Director of the MFA's Department for External Policy Planning.  On 
June 26, we discussed with Zakharov U.S. efforts to encourage the 
Government of Nigeria (GON) to devote resources and high-level 
attention to polio eradication and vaccination efforts, and asked 
for Russia to reiterate this message with the GON.  Zakharov said he 
would need to discuss the issue further with the MFA's Departments 
for Africa, International Organizations, and External Policy 
Planning, before the MFA would be in a position to react to the U.S. 
request that Russia weigh in with the GON on polio eradication and 
vaccination.
