RUSSIA WELCOMES COOPERATION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 134271 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In an October 2 meeting, we delivered reftel 
demarche to MFA New Threats and Challenges Senior Counselor 
Vladimir Prokhorov.  Prokhorov expressed dismay over the 
flight of Riza Altun and disappointment with the lack of 
cooperation between France and Austria.  He told us that he 
would pass the information to his law enforcement colleagues, 
and asked to be kept informed of any developments. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Prokhorov assured us that the GOR sees cooperation 
against terrorism as one of the highlights of our bilateral 
relationship, and welcomes increased cooperation on customs 
and border controls and tracking financial transactions.  He 
reiterated that the GOR is anxiously awaiting dates for the 
next CTWG, in order to further implement this collaboration.
