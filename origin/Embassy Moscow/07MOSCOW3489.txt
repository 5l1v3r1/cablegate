REFTEL: 1. 06 USDOC 02257 DATED 5/24/06 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, State Joint-Stock Railway Company, Tashkent, 
Uzbekistan. The company is listed on BIS license 
application D349392 as the ultimate consignee of two 
cesium frequency clocks, model: PRS-4500. These items 
are controlled for national security reasons under 
ECCN 3A002.G.L. The licensee is Symmetricom Inc., 2300 
Orchard PKWY, San Jose, CA 95131. 
 
¶3. On July 10, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with State Joint- 
Stock Railway Company (SJSRC), 7 Shevchenko st., 
Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The export control team met with 
Navrus Erkinov, Head of Service Department and Marat 
Nasyrov, Deputy Head of Service Department. 
 
¶4. SJSRC was founded in 1994 as the successor 
organization to the Soviet Union Railroad system. 
SJSRC is primarily responsible for operation of the 
Uzbekistan Railroads (UR) service and infrastructure, 
and maintenance of way for UR lines. SJSRC employs 
45,000 throughout Uzbekistan. 
 
¶5. The Department of Signals and Telecommunications 
(DS&T) of the SJSRC is currently upgrading the 
signaling systems on UR rail lines. Finding for the 
project came from a credit tender provided by the 
Asian Development Bank.  The cesium primary reference 
sources (PRS) in reftel are a key component to the 
system, allowing precise time control for switching 
and rail operations on a 700km section of the system. 
New fiber-optic cable links have been installed on the 
central line between Tashkent and Kagan, allowing for 
safer and faster switching operations.  The PRS units 
are located at the Headquarters building in Tashkent, 
and at the satellite facility at Railroad Station 
Vukhara-II in Kagan. It is hoped to have the entire 
railroad connected to the fiber optic switching system 
by September 2007. DS&T employs 3000, with 15 in the 
communications section at the Tashkent headquarters 
and the remainder at various posts nationwide. 
 
¶6. The team was able to examine one Symmetriccom 
TimeCesium 4500 Cesium Primary Reference Source(PRS- 
4500) S/N 0606006806.  The PRS-4500 is rack-mounted in 
the communications center, located on the grounds of 
the SJSRC complex.  The room is protected by a cipher- 
lock system, and is under video surveillance at all 
times.  Access to communications facilities is limited 
to authorized personnel, and equipment is inventoried 
and checked regularly.  Security at all railroad 
facilities includes a pass system for employees and 
authorized visitors, limiting and controlling access 
to all railroad facilities.  SJSRC is a twenty-four 
hour a day operation, and has security posts and video 
surveillance systems at the communication centers in 
Tashkent and Kagan.  Four employees have regular 
access to the equipment.

Railway Company, Tashkent, Uzbekistan as reliable 
recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
