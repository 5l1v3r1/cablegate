year.  The Karat plant is located approximately 7 hours outside of 
Kiev.  Sergey Yurievich Larkin stated that Nauka has also purchased 
two additional units from the reftel exporter SVT Associates, which 
are awaiting customs clearance in Kiev.  Sergey Yurievich Larkin 
gave the export control team a series of photos showing the reftel 
commodity installed and operating at the Karat facility.  Larkin 
stated that the Karat facility is a former military complex with 
limited access. 
 
¶6. Although the export control team was not able to personally 
inspect the reftel commodity, it does appear that it is being used 
for the purpose for which it was licensed.  The company had ordered 
two additional units.  There are no indications of impropriety with 
Nauka and the LarkinQs answers to the export control team were not 
evasive.
