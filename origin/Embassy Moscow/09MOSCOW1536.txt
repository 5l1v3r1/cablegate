Moscow, June 08, 2009 
No. FS-SD-2/5524 
 
Mr. James B. Miller 
Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign 
Agricultural Services 
USDA 
 
Dear Mr. Miller, 
 
The Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary 
Surveillance Service (VPSS) extends its regards 
to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and in 
response to your letter of June 2, 2009 would 
like to express its gratitude for the active 
participation of the U.S. industry in the 
"round table" during our meetings in Paris. 
This event allowed us to enlarge mutual 
understanding of the tasks that are currently 
in front of the Russian and the U.S. relevant 
services as well as related to producers and 
consumers of meat and meat products. 
 
At the same time VPSS would like to draw your 
attention to the urgent necessity of 
negotiating the new veterinary certificate for 
frozen pork meat and by-products exported to 
the Russian Federation, a draft of which was 
sent to FSIS on February 10, 2009.  We believe 
that there is not any interconnection between 
the process of negotiating the document and the 
orientation visit of the VPSS delegation to the 
United States,which was planned for the first 
half of May, 2009. As you know, this visit was 
cancelled for that time because of the 
resolution of the Chief Medical Officer of the 
Russian Federation # 29 of May 06, 2009 "On the 
measures for prevention of the import and 
expansion of highly-pathogenic influenza virus 
in the territory of the Russian Federation" 
which recommended the Russians to avoid trips 
to the countries of the American continent. 
 
Now, taking into account your request and the 
application from FSIS, VPSS considers it 
possible to extend the deadline for the 
 
negotiation of the veterinary certificate until 
August 1, 2009.  If FSIS will not adopt the 
document before that date, VPSS will be obliged 
to bring it into force unilaterally. 
 
Mr. Miller, please let me assure you of my 
highest esteem. 
 
Head of VPSS 
S.A. Dankvert 
 
END TEXT. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment. It is clear that VPSS intends 
to push the limits of its authority by 
threatening to unilaterally disavow the pork 
certificate negotiated as part of the U.S.- 
Russia WTO market access agreement in November 
¶2006. Perhaps the June 9 announcement by Prime 
Minister Putin to withdraw Russia's WTO bid and 
reapply as a customs union with Kazakhstan and 
Belarus (Septel) may have emboldened VPPS  to 
make new threats to the U.S. pork trade with 
Russia.  (N.B. The VPSS letter was dated June 8 
but not transmitted to the embassy until June 
10, after Putin's June 9 announcement.)  In 
October 2008, when VPPS called into question 
the validity of the 2006 agreements with 
respect to plant inspections (REF B), Chief 
Russian WTO Negotiator Maksim Medvedkov 
confirmed that the 2006 agreements were valid 
and that there was a formal procedure in place 
which Russia would follow if they were to 
renegotiate those agreements.  In addition, 
since Putin's June 9 announcement about the 
customs union and WTO, Russian officials have 
told us they still intend to push forward with 
resolving SPS and other meat trade issues with 
the U.S. and other WTO members.(Septel) End 
Comment.
