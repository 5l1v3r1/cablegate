¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine the legitimacy 
and reliability of the end-user, SKARD Electronic, Kursk, Russia. 
The company is listed on BIS license application D408571 as the 
ultimate consignee of TriQuint Semi-conductor 33 - 47 GHZ wideband 
driver amplifier. This item is controlled for national security and 
nuclear non-proliferation reasons under ECCN 3A001. The licensee is 
RFMW, Ltd, 90 Great Oaks Blvd., Suite 107, San Jose, CA  95119. 
 
¶3. On February 4, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested pre-license check at the 
offices of SKARD Electronic, Katla Marksa 70B, Kursk, Russia. The 
export control team met with Oleg Donskoy, Deputy General Director, 
and Vladimir Semykin, Commercial Director. 
 
¶4. SKARD Electronic is a privately held company that was established 
in 2002.  SKARD has two principal owners and has approximately 80 
employees.  SKARD specializes in radio and electronics relay, 
microwave and metrology.  SKARD is fully licensed within the 1 -40 
GHZ radio microwave frequencies. SKARD does approximately 1 million 
USD in annual sales, has an almost monopoly in the local market and 
according to Oleg Donskoy, Deputy General Director, SKARD actually 
turns away business.

team that SKARD Electronic is purchasing the RFMW, Ltd's 33 - 47 GHZ 
wideband driver amplifier for the construction of radio relay 
stations. The purchase will be for testing the relay stations until 
the project to install the system in the greater Kursk area passes 
the development stage. 
 
¶6.  SKARD Electronic appears to have the commercial viability to 
make the purchase.  SKARD has the technical sophistication and a 
legitimate need for the commodity in reftel.  The export control 
team did not detect and possible connection to state sponsored 
terrorism.  SKARD is not involved in any chemical, biological, 
nuclear or missile programs.
