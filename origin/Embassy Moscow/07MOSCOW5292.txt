Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Russian officials regard space cooperation with 
Kazakhstan as on track, despite reported disputes over 
leasing arrangements for the Baikonur cosmodrome and 
compensation for damages caused by a recent rocket explosion 
at the site.  Plans for the construction in the Russian Far 
East of a new civilian launch facility for manned-flights are 
underway; if realized, the facility would contribute to the 
GOR's effort to stimulate development in that region. 
Roscosmos representatives stressed to us the need for the 
central government to continue to play the leading role in 
space activities.  They were dismissive of the possibilities 
for commercial space travel.  End Summary. 
 
"Two Brothers" 
------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On October 30, Embassy met with Vyacheslav 
Lisitsin, Director of the International Cooperation 
Department at Roscosmos.  Lisitsin was keen to dismiss claims 
that there were serious troubles with Kazakhstan over 
Russia's leasing of the Baikonur cosmodrome for space 
launches.  He emphasized that Russia had developed strong 
relations with Kazakhstan and that the two were "essentially 
brothers."  His statements were consistent with remarks made 
in Astana in October by FM Lavrov, who praised 
Russian-Kazakhstani cooperation in Baikonur. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Lisitsin admitted that a few "delicate" problems 
exist with Baikonur.  He referred to the September 6 rocket 
accident in which a Proton-M rocket carrying a Japanese 
commercial satellite crashed shortly after lift-off, 
scattering debris and hazardous material in the nearby area. 
Kazakhstan reportedly seeks about $60 million in damages for 
the accident.  Lisitsin said that the two governments had 
established a commission to study the accident.  The incident 
risked delaying the late October launch of another rocket 
carrying three GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System) 
satellites. 
 
Space in the Far East 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  In September, Roscosmos announced plans to build a 
new cosmodrome for civilian launches, including manned 
flights, in the Russian Far East no earlier than 2020. 
Military launches would continue at Plesetsk.  Lisitsin told 
us that a new launch facility on Russian territory would help 
stimulate the economy in the Far Eastern region, providing 
jobs and opportunities, especially in the development of 
space technologies.  A new launch site also would help 
develop the means to accomplish Russia's future manned space 
missions to the moon and Mars.  However, for now, the new 
launch site is simply a "political announcement."  Lisitsin 
did not provide any details on possible locations for the new 
site. 
 
Chinese on the ISS? 
------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Following the October International Space Station 
(ISS) mission featuring the first Malaysian crew member, 
Chinese government officials reportedly expressed interest in 
placing a Chinese crew member on board the ISS.  When asked 
how Russia felt about China's possible participation, 
Lisitsin said he knew nothing about it.  He and the other 
Roscosmos officials at the meeting looked skeptical and made 
no comments about what role China might play. 
 
State: The Final Frontier 
------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Lisitsin stressed to us that no country that is 
serious about pursuing a space program can rely primarily on 
private industry.  The state must play the leading role. 
Besides satellite launches, there is little profit to be 
found in space, he contended.  Lisitsin insisted that the 
role of the state is vital for reasons that go beyond just 
R&D, including licensing, regulation, and liability of space 
projects.  He downplayed the possibilities of commercial 
space tourism as a viable industry.  When we mentioned some 
of the latest entrepreneurial initiatives for space travel, 
such as sub-orbital commercial flights, Lisitsin and other 
Roscosmos officials shrugged.

------- 
 
¶7. (SBU)  Lisitsin's downplaying of space tourism and praise 
for the state's central role in space are consistent with the 
general tenor of a more self-confident GOR.  Lisitsin was 
quick to dismiss at anything which harkened back to the image 
of a cash-strapped Russia seeking to shore up its underfunded 
space program by catering to wealthy space tourists.
