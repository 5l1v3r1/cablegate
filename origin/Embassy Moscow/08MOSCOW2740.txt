¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: In a letter from Economic 
Development Minister Nabiullina to U.S. Trade 
Representative Schwab that the embassy received 
on September 11, the GOR proposes expert level 
consultations on the Meat Agreement signed 
between Russia and the United States in 2005 as 
part of Russia's bid to join the WTO.  The Meat 
Agreement confirmed a special mechanism by which 
the United States may export a set quantity of 
pork, beef and poultry to Russia at a mutually 
agreed tariff level through the end of 2009. 
Russian officials have previously stated they 
want to substantially lower the quota for U.S. 
poultry in 2009 (Refs B, C), and raise over-quota 
duties on pork and poultry.  The original scanned 
copy and courtesy translation were sent to USDA, 
USTR and the State Department's Russia Desk on 
September 11 (REF A).  An informal embassy 
translation of the letter follows.  END SUMMARY.

Moscow September 11, 2008 
No. 12693-EN/D11 
 
Ambassador S.C. Schwab 
U.S. Trade Representative 
Washington, D.C. 
 
First, I would like to express my gratitude for 
the attention you pay regarding Russia?s WTO 
accession and to the development of our bilateral 
economic and trade relations in general. 
 
We intend to continue active collaboration in the 
multilateral negotiations within the framework of 
the working group for WTO accession, and we are 
ready to make efforts to solve outstanding 
problems through mutual agreement before the end 
of this year. 
 
In that regard, I would like to voice one 
particular issue related to the bilateral 
Russian-American Agreement on trade in certain 
types of poultry, beef and pork, signed in 
Washington on June 15, 2005. 
 
Bearing in mind that this part of trade is of 
high importance for both of our countries, we are 
ready to discuss any issues of concern with our 
partners. 
 
We would like to propose that our specialists, 
without any delay, conduct consultations on the 
trade of meat products in the nearest future. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Minister E. Nabiullina
