¶1. (SBU) EST officer delivered draft Nuclear Suppliers Group 
(NSG) Policy Statement on Civil Nuclear Cooperation with 
India (reftel) September 20 to NSG expert in MFA's Security 
Department (DVBR), Mikhail Kondratenkov.  Kondratenkov 
appreciated the opportunity for Russia to have the chance to 
review the Statement before its general distribution.  He 
promised to pass the draft to DVBR Deputy Director Oleg 
Rozhkov right away. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  While he did not see any immediate problems with 
the draft, Kondratenkov said he wanted to review it in detail 
before making specific comments.  He expressed interest in 
knowing the anticipated timing for the release of the draft 
to the rest of the NSG Participating Governments.  He 
expected MFA would be able to get back to us with further 
comments by October 1, as requested.
