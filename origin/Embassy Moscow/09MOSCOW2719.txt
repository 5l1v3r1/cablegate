¶1.  (C)  Summary.  During the October 27-29 visit to Moscow 
of Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, several bilateral 
cooperation and trade agreements were signed, but the 
meetings did not conclude with the GOR granting any 
substantive arms deals, nor did President Correa recognize 
the breakaway republics of South Ossetia or Abkhazia. 
Ecuador purchased two helicopters, the two countries signed a 
joint Declaration of Strategic Partnership, and the GOR 
secured deals for Russian joint investment projects in 
energy, nuclear power, and telecom development in Ecuador. 
While President Correa left the door open to recognize the 
two republics, he may likely be still holding out for a 
better financial or military deal from the GOR which would 
outweigh the possible negative consequences of recognition. 
End summary. 
 
---------------------- 
New Strategic Partners 
---------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U)  In the first-ever visit of a President of Ecuador to 
Moscow, President Rafael Correa Delgado along with the 
Ecuador Minister of Foreign Affairs Fander Falkoni and 
Minister of Defense Javier Ponce met on October 29 with 
President Dmitriy Medvedev.  President Correa also met with 
Prime Minister Putin, Patriarch Kirill of the Russian 
Orthodox Church, Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, and Russian 
business executives interested in investing in Ecuador. 
President Correa and a delegation of Ecuadorian lawmakers 
also met with Federation Council representative Sergey 
Mironov, who announced a sister city agreement between 
Vladivostok and Manta, Ecuador.  After a more than 20-year 
hiatus, the Russian-Ecuadorian Intergovernmental Commission 
for Economic and Energy Issues convened on October 28, 
chaired by Russian Agriculture Minister Elena Skrynnik and 
Ecuadorian Minister of Economic Policy Diego Borja.  Trade 
between the countries was nearly $1 billion in 2008, with 
Ecuador's main exports to Russia consisting of fruit and 
flowers, and Russia mainly exporting iron materials and 
fertilizer to Ecuador. 
 
¶3.  (U)  After their meeting, President Medvedev and 
President Correa signed a Declaration on the Strategic 
Partnership, which contained several side agreements dealing 
with economic, humanitarian, and political issues.  According 
to Interfax, the Russian Energy Ministry, the Ecuadorian 
Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, and the 
Ecuadorian Minister of Mines and Petroleum signed a 
Memorandum of Mutual Understanding. The GOR and Ecuador also 
penned agreements on hydropower projects and the development 
of telecom technologies in Ecuador.  Rosatom also announced 
an agreement on civil-nuclear cooperation, including possible 
joint project in construction of nuclear power facilities and 
uranium exploration in Ecuador. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Investments Focused on Economy, not Military 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U)  Upon his departure from Russia on October 30, 
President Correa announced that the GOR promised to invest 
over $2.5 billion in Ecuador by 2014, which he noted would be 
focused on transport, infrastructure, science and technology. 
 GOR Finance Minister Alexey Kudrin confirmed to press 
sources that Ecuador had requested a loan from the GOR, but 
noted that negotiations concerning the loan amount and terms 
had not yet begun.  The GOR has not yet acknowledged granting 
any loan to President Correa. 
 
¶5.  (U)  As part of his visit, President Correa finalized the 
purchase of two MI-17 Hip multirole helicopters.  President 
Medvedev noted that while this was a small military contract, 
it was "the beginning of (Russian-Ecuadorian) interaction in 
this area," with good prospects for future relations.  Before 
the visit, independent business daily Vedomosti reported that 
Russia was interested in supplying six Su-30MK2 Flanker 
multirole fighters, several helicopters and air defense 
systems to Ecuador, but the GOR has only confirmed the sale 
of the two helicopters.  The Russian Ambassador to Ecuador, 
Yan Burlyai, told Echo Moskviy on October 29 that these 
helicopters were replacements for older helicopters and that 
this pact should not be considered as fueling an arms race in 
the Latin American region.

Ecuador to Consider Recognition 
of South Ossetia and Abkhazia 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (U)  Despite the flurry of media speculation that 
President Correa planned to recognize South Ossetia and 
Abkhazia during his trip, much like Venezuelan President 
Chavez did on his visit to Moscow September 10 (ref A), 
President Correa did not announce recognition.  Instead, on 
the day after his meeting with President Medvedev and hours 
before he was to leave Moscow, President Correa said, "if 
both regions officially ask Ecuador to recognize them, we 
will seriously consider this request." 
 
¶7.  (U)  South Ossetian "foreign minister" Murat Dzhioyev 
told RIA Novosti on October 30 that South Ossetia would "of 
course officially ask" Ecuador for recognition.  Likewise, 
Abkhazian "foreign minister" Sergey Shamba announced on 
October 30 that Abkhazia would also shortly be sending 
Ecuador their official request for recognition.  Even before 
President Correa's visit, leaders of the breakaway regions 
were hopeful that Ecuador would follow Nicaragua and 
Venezuela, with Dzhioyev telling Vedomosti that they had 
strong hopes for recognition by Ecuador and Bolivia, and 
deputy "foreign minister" of Abkhazia Maxim Gvindzhia 
claiming that "the other Alliance for the People of Our 
America (ALBA) countries will eventually recognize (the 
republics) too."  (Note:  Nicaragua, Venezuela and Ecuador 
are all members of ALBA.  End note).  Alexei Makarkin, 
vice-president of the Center for Political Technologies, told 
Interfax that recognizing the republics is a "purely anti-US 
gesture, and...Ecuador has no reason to exacerbate its 
relations with the U.S." by making such a recognition. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  (C)  The only other countries to recognize the breakaway 
republics earned sizable military agreements and investment 
packages from Russia.  Venezuela was given $4.4 billion by 
the GOR to establish a Russian-Venezuelan bank as well as 
continued arms-for-credit deals of tanks and air defense 
systems (ref A).  Nicaragua, the first country after Russia 
to recognize, gained more attention from Moscow as well as a 
gift of 130 municipal buses (ref B).  By comparison, 
dividends from President Correa's trip to Moscow were modest, 
and he is likely waiting for larger military or investment 
offers from the GOR in exchange for becoming the next country 
to recognize, a decision which likely would worsen Ecuador's 
relations with the U.S.  End comment.
