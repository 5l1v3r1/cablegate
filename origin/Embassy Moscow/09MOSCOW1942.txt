REFTELS: REQUEST FORM #04210022; DATED 6/19/2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Tehkom, Moscow, Russia. 
The company is listed on BIS license applications: NLR as the 
ultimate consignee of one electronic circuit unmounted and 
electronic devices and components. These items are controlled for 
national security, missile technology, nuclear nonproliferation and 
anti-terrorism reasons under ECCN 3A001. The licensee is Actel 
Corporation, 2061 Stierlin CT, Mountain View, CA. 
 
¶3. On July 15, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina attempted to conduct the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of the U.S. Commercial Service, U.S. 
Embassy, 8, B. Devyatinsky per., Moscow, Russia. The export control 
team met with Vladislav Boikachev, General Director. 
 
 
¶4. The Moscow export control team had received the reftel on June 
19, 2009 and made several attempts to schedule the post shipment 
verification with Vladislav Boikachev.  Boikachev repeatedly 
challenged both the authority of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to 
conduct such a check within Russia, and the identity of members of 
the Moscow export control team as actual U.S. Embassy employees. 
After several requests from the Moscow export control office, 
Boikachev refused to meet with the Moscow export control team at his 
office under any circumstances. LES Shipitsina eventually convinced 
Boikachev to meet with the Moscow export control team at the offices 
of the Foreign Commercial Service located at the U.S. Embassy and 
scheduled the meeting for July 15, 2009. 
 
¶5. On July 15, 2009 the Moscow export control team met with 
Boikachev at the entrance of the Foreign Commercial Service, in the 
entrance foyer prior to going through the U.S. Embassy security 
check point. Once confronted by the U.S. Embassy security personnel 
and asked to provide his Russian passport, Boikavchev refused to 
cooperate and left the Embassy without the post shipment 
verification being conducted. 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post does not/not recommend Tehkom, Moscow, 
Russia, as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities.
