SUBJECT: RUSSIA PROMISES CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR U.S. GOALS 
ON CRITERIA-BASED APPROACH FOR ENR TRANSFERS 
 
REF: STATE 115509 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  ESTOff delivered reftel demarche to Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA) Security and Disarmament Affairs Second 
Secretary Alexander Bolichiov on November 5.  Bolichiov was 
clear that the GOR continues to support the revised U.S. 
criteria-based proposal for Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) 
control of transfers of enrichment and reprocessing (ENR) 
equipment and technology.  Bolichiov indicated that the 
Russian delegation will be given flexibility to work with the 
U.S. and others at the November 19 meeting. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Bolichiov expressed concern that if there were 
changes made since the draft circulated at the May 22 meeting 
in Berlin, he has not received the document.  If there were 
"substantial" changes to the document, they  might exceed the 
Russian delegation's authority to act.  He also asked "What 
is the next step?  If consensus is reached, what if Canada or 
Japan come forward requesting the transfer such technology? 
What will the be the U.S. position?"  Post will follow up 
with ISN/NESS as appropriate to respond to his query.
