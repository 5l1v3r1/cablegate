ACT 
 
REF:  STATE 52541 
 
¶1. (U) Summary.  In response to Department request for information 
contributing to a country review for Title III suspension of the 
Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act, GOR support 
for the development of democracy in Cuba has been marginal, and 
Russia's economic relations with Cuba are limited.  However, 
Russia's business sector recently has expressed interest in possible 
investment and cooperation with Cuba in the technological, energy 
and medical fields.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Limited Democracy Efforts 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Post is aware of no major efforts on the part of the GOR to 
advance democracy and human rights in Cuba.  Despite recent efforts 
to expand ties with Cuba, which rest on historic ties dating back to 
the Cold War, the GOR has not extended support for and solidarity 
with the Cuban people by drawing attention to the plight of Cuban 
prisoners; calling for a democratic transition in Cuba; and 
supporting Cuba's democratic opposition or civil society. 
 
 
 
---------------------------- 
Limited Human Rights Efforts 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The GOR has not made public statements in support of 
democracy following the undemocratic succession of power from Fidel 
to Raul Castro.  In line with Russia's policy of "non-interference 
in internal matters," the GOR has not called for parliamentary 
resolutions condemning human rights abuses in Cuba and has not 
supported Cuba's thriving civil society. 
 
---------------------------- 
High Level Diplomatic Visits 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) According to press reports, in April 2008, Russian Minister 
of Transport, Igor Levitin met with his Cuban counterpart, Ricardo 
Cabrisas, to develop Russian-Cuban cooperation in the banking, 
energy, transportation, science and technology, and information and 
communications sectors.  Also discussed was the possibility of 
economic and military collaboration.  Levitin was accompanied to 
Havana by a delegation of over 100 officials and businessmen, who 
also attended the eighth meeting of the bilateral intergovernmental 
commission.  Levitin called for the modernization of Cuba's Soviet 
era facilities and equipment.  According to press reports, in the 
future Russia hoped to provide Cuba with new KamAZ trucks, lifting 
equipment, planes and buses. 
 
--------------------- 
Nature of Investments 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) In February 2008, according to press reports, a Russian oil 
Company, Lukoil, expressed interest in Cuba's energy sector and was 
examining the possibility of building refineries in Cuba.  Lukoil 
also was investigating the possibility of surveying the Gulf of 
Mexico for crude oil deposits. Nafta-Sintez, another Russian energy 
company, also expressed interest in investing in Cuba's energy 
sector.  According to press reports, Cuban officials expressed 
interest in acquiring Russian buses to modernize its transportation 
system.  In December 2007, the Russian aviation leasing company 
Ilyushin Finance provided Cuba with two TU 204-100E airplanes as a 
part of Cuba's broader effort to modernize its aviation fleet. 
 
----------------------- 
Bilateral Trade Efforts 
----------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) According to press reports about Levitin's trip to Cuba in 
2007, bilateral trade reached $363 million dollars and Cuba was 
Russia's sixth largest trading partner in Latin America. 
Approximately 29,000 Russian tourists, who do not require entry 
visas, visited Cuba in 2007.  In May 2008, the St. Petersburg 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry received a delegation of Cuban 
businessmen who gave a presentation on business investment 
opportunities in Cuba.  This was the largest visit of its kind, led 
by Raul Becerra, the head of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce, and 
Alejandro Mustelier, the president of the Cuba-Russia Business 
Council, together with 29 executives.  According to press reports, 
the Russian business sector has expressed interest in importing 
Cuban rum, vaccines and medical equipment.

Limited Exchange Programs 
-------------------------

¶7. (U) Post is aware of no major exchange programs that would 
include scholarships for Russians to study in Cuba; Cuban-paid 
medical travel for Russian nationals; and Cuban doctors working in 
Russia.  During a business roundtable event on the margins of 
Levitin's visit, representatives from Russian regions proposed 
establishing university medical exchanges that would allow Russian 
doctors to complete their medical internship or residency at Cuban 
institutions.  The roundtable also discussed the possibility of 
Russian children traveling to Cuban summer camps.  According to 
press reports, the camp proposal was not only intended to promote 
cultural exchanges between the two countries, but also to provide 
the possibility of Cuban medical treatment for sick Russian 
children.  We are not aware of any further concrete steps to 
establish medical exchanges that have been taken since Levitin's 
visit.  From April 1 to 11, 2008, Russian and Cuban medical 
specialists held a conference in Cuba on men's reproductive health. 
Over 200 Russian and Cuban urologists and endocrinologists 
participated in the conference, according to media reports.
