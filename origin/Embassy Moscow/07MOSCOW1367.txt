¶1. (SBU)  Summary:  On March 27, the Central Election 
Commission (CEC) elected Vladimir Churov as its new chairman. 
 A physicist and St. Petersburg native, with long-standing 
ties to Putin, Churov announced that he would implement 
electoral law, not debate it.  Duma members and civil society 
representatives predict a more loyal and lower profile 
chairman.  Besides Churov, the new CEC leadership includes 
United Russia and Just Russia representation in an apparent 
attempt to balance the two Kremlin parties' interests.  An 
important mid-April regional election provides the first 
opportunity for Churov to set the tone for his chairmanship. 
End summary.

The New CEC Team 
---------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  In a 13-2 secret ballot, Duma Deputy Vladimir 
Churov was elected the Central Election Commission's (CEC) 
new chairman.  Churov was elected to the State Duma in 2003 
on the LDPR ticket and has been part of the LDPR faction, 
although he identifies himself as not being a member of any 
party.  He hails from St. Petersburg and was educated as a 
physicist.  From 1992-1998, Churov worked for Putin on the 
Commission for External Relations in Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak's 
office.  He has no legal background, but did serve as an OSCE 
election observer in Kyrgyzstan. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  In addition to Churov, the CEC leadership troika 
includes Stanislav Vavilov as the new Deputy Chairman and 
Nikolay Konkin as the new Secretary.  Vavilov is a 
Presidential Administration representative and United Russia 
member, who previously served on the Federation Council, 
where he worked on the Committee for Law and Judicial Issues. 
 Konkin, who served on the previous CEC, is a member of Just 
Russia and is a Federation Council representative.  Golos' 
Liliya Shibanova speculated that the new team reflected a 
desire to balance United Russia and Just Russia's influence 
on elections. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  According to press reports, Churov's election was 
seamless, only CEC advisory member and KPRF lawyer Vadim 
Soloviev posed any questions, asking Churov whether he agreed 
with LDPR Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's more controversial 
statements or supported the use of "steam engine" candidates 
on party lists. (NOTE: This refers to the practice whereby 
parties put well-known members or celebrities at the head of 
the list, even though they would not serve if elected.)

Expected To Be Self-Effacing 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  In his first remarks as Chairman, Churov announced 
that he saw himself as an implementer of election law, not a 
commentator.  Duma contacts have highlighted a family 
connection, with Churov's father or uncle putatively having 
worked with Putin's father.  These Duma members speculate 
that Churov will be a loyal and reliable CEC Chairman, who 
understands his "proper role" as part of the executive branch 
and will refrain from public dissent. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Civil society contacts, keying off of Churov's 
comments, are pessimistic that the new CEC Chairman will 
continue former CEC Chairman Veshnyakov's efforts to use the 
Commission as a bully pulpit against additional electoral 
reforms that narrow the ability of opposition political 
parties to compete.  Most emphasized his personal ties to 
Putin, and expect that Churov will be loyal to the Kremlin, 
less public, and will want to keep outsiders out of Russia's 
affairs.  Not all observers, however, are concerned.  Former 
CEC Chairman Aleksandr Ivanchenko (1995-1999) told reporters 
that since the CEC was becoming a body tasked with simply 
carrying out elections, rather than the more political role 
it had held during Russia's transition to democracy, a 
technocratic chairman would suffice to count the ballots.

¶6. (SBU)  Distancing himself from former CEC Chairman 
Aleksandr Veshnyakov's perceived mistake of being too 
outspoken in opposing changes to the election law, Churov has 
signaled that he will lower the Chairman's profile.  With the 
Krasnoyarsk regional election scheduled for April 15,  we 
will soon get our first impressions regarding the tone Churov 
intends to set.  Political commentators dub Krasnoyarsk

Russia's "New Hampshire," since it is considered to be a 
microcosm of the country and indicator of political 
sentiment.  It promises to be an important race for Churov to 
demonstrate how he intends to arbitrate electoral disputes.
