SUBJECT: RUSSIA RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON LIABILITY AND REDRESS UNDER 
CARTAGENA PROTOCOL 
 
REF: STATE 11910 
 
On February 11, post delivered reftel talking points to Counselor 
Vladimir Linev of the MFA International Organizations Department. 
Linev responded that, as Russia is not party to the Cartagena 
Protocol, Russian delegates will not participate in the February 
23-27 meetings in Mexico City.  He added that the GOR has not 
decided on the lead agency for Cartagena Protocol issues.  However, 
he appreciated receiving the USG points to better prepare for the 
October 2010 meeting in Japan, where Russia plans to participate. 
Linev advised us to seek a meeting with MFA three to four months 
before the Japan meeting to develop a joint approach.  He warned, 
however, that because Russian legislation on these issues is very 
strict, Russia is more likely to support the EU rather than the U.S. 
position.
