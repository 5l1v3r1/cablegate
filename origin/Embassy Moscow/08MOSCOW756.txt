SUBJECT: RUSSIA'S BUDGET TRANSPARENCY 
 
REF: STATE 16737 
 
The Government of the Russian Federation (GOR) makes its 
budget and subsequent amendments publicly available in print 
and on the Finance Ministry's website.  Not all budget line 
items, however, are included in the publicly available 
document.  The undisclosed items fall under the heading of 
"National Security Issues" and include various defense and 
intelligence expenditures.  The USG no longer provides 
program support to enhance the GOR's fiscal transparency, nor 
do other countries or multilateral institutions.  Russia has, 
however, agreed to let the IMF report on the country's 
compliance with standards covering fiscal transparency.
