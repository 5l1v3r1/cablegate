SUBJECT: VIEWS ON 15 NOVEMBER 2007 IAEA DG'S REPORT ON IRAN 
AND NEXT STEPS 
 
REF: STATE 157039 
 
The Deputy Political Counselor met with Julian Juarez, the 
Foreign Ministry's Deputy Director of its United Nations 
office, November 28, to discuss continued U.S. concerns as 
relate to Iran's failure to cooperate with the terms under 
the IAEA Work Plan.  Juarez said that while Mexico believed 
every state had a sovereign right to pursue nuclear energy as 
an option in meeting its country's energy needs, Mexico 
shared U.S. concerns about the lack of cooperation Iran has 
extended on its nuclear program.  Juarez offered no views on 
pursuing new UNSC sanctions against Iran.  In the past, 
Juarez has conveyed Mexico's preference this matter be 
addressed by the IAEA but an appreciation for U.S. 
frustration with Iran for its failure to comply with its 
obligations.
