SUBJECT: MEXICO ON PARIS DONORS CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 163955 
 
Deputy Political Counselor met with Julien Juarez, the Deputy 
Director of the Foreign Ministry's UN Office, December 6, to 
urge Mexico to attend and support the upcoming donors 
conference in Paris.  Juarez was not aware Mexico had been 
invited to the conference but was confident if that were the 
case it would send a representative.  He did not speak to 
whether Mexico would announce a pledge of assistance but that 
is probably unlikely.  Juarez suggested he was impressed with 
U.S. efforts to bring together the Israeli and Palestinian 
leaders in Annapolis in the face of resistance from their own 
domestic constituencies.  Attendance by major regional 
players including from the Arab world was noteworthy but in 
the end he considered continued strong U.S. leadership 
indispensable to the achievement of any lasting peace 
settlement in the Middle East.
