SUBJECT: MEXICO ON 3/17 OAS MINISTERIAL 
 
REF: STATE 25971 
 
¶1.  Acting PolCouns stressed with Minister Jose Antonio 
Zabulguitia, 
the Foreign Ministry's Director General of the Office of 
Regional 
Organizations and Mechanisms in the Americas, the importance 
the U.S. 
attached to using the 3/17 OAS Consultations to focus on the 
future 
and better address transnational threats that contribute to 
conflicts. 
Zabulguitia, who will represent Mexico at the upcoming 
consultations, 
believed the Rio Group meeting had contributed significantly 
to a 
lowering of tensions.  Nonetheless, he thought the OAS should 
assume 
the lead for producing a longer term resolution. 
 
¶2.  Separately, Zabulguitia noted that both Uruguay and the 
Dominican 
Republic were vying to preside over the 3/17 Consultations. 
Mexico 
respected both countries and did not favor one over the 
other.  However, 
Zabulguitia wanted the U.S. to know that Mexico thought it 
important 
for this question to be resolved on the basis of consensus 
rather than 
a contentious vote.
