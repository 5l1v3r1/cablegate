Classified By: AMBASSADOR ANTONIO O. GARZA, JR. REASONS 1.4(B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (U) A STRONG MILITARY-TO-MILITARY RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO 
IS VITAL TO ACHIEVING OUR COMMON NATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM 
(CT) AND COUNTERNARCOTICS (CN) GOALS.  SINCE ITS STAND-UP IN 
2002, USNORTHCOM, IN CONCERT WITH MY COUNTRY TEAM, HAS MADE 
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN IMPROVING OUR MILITARY RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE MEXICAN ARMED FORCES.  IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE SEIZE 
EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THE VERY LATEST CT TRAINING AND 
KEY TACTICAL EQUIPMENT TO OUR PARTNER NATION AND IMPROVE 
BI-LATERAL COOPERATION IN THE CT/CN MISSION AREAS.  PROVIDING 
ANOTHER ROUND OF SECTION 1206 CT FUNDING IN FY09 TO MEXICO, 
ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION'S CONTINUED 
NATIONAL CRACKDOWN ON CRIMINAL TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS, IS 
AGAIN TIMELY, AND FULLY SUPPORTED BY MY COUNTRY TEAM. 
 
¶2. (C) MY USEMB-MEX COUNTRY TEAM AND USNORTHCOM'S 
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE OFFICE OF DEFENSE COORDINATION FULLY 
SUPPORT THE COMBATANT COMMAND'S PROPOSAL TO ALLOCATE 
$10,100,000 OF FY09 1206 FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL CT EQUIPMENT 
AND TRAINING FOR MEXICO.  USNORTHCOM SPONSORED DIGITAL MEDIA 
FORENSICS EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING, RIGID HULLED INFLATABLE 
BOATS (RHIBS) FOR SEMAR, AND CT PERSONAL SUPPORT EQUIPMENT 
FOR SEDENA'S AND SEMAR'S SPECIAL FORCES WILL PROVIDE MEXICO 
WITH CONTINUED ADVANCED COMBAT CAPABILITIES AND UNIQUELY 
TRAINED PERSONNEL TO EXECUTE CT MISSIONS MORE EFFECTIVELY. 
ADDITIONALLY, THIS SPECIAL CT EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING WILL 
ENHANCE MISSION INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN U.S. UNITS AND 
MEXICAN FORCES IN SUPPORT OF THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR. 
AGAIN, I FULLY SUPPORT USNORTHCOM'S FY09 CT TRAINING PLAN, 
USING SECTION 1206 FUNDING, AS A MODEL FOR SUPPORTING ONE OF 
OUR KEY PARTNER NATIONS IN WINNING THE GWOT.
