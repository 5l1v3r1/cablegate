REF: A. MEXICO 6656 
     ¶B. MEXICO 6604 
     ¶C. MEXICO 6571 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR CHARLES V. BARCLAY, 
REASONS: 1.4(B/D). 
 
¶1. (SBU) Felipe Calderon security cabinet appointments, made 
the day before his December 1 presidential inauguration, 
include: Guillermo Galvan Galvan as Secretary of Defense, 
Mariano Francisco Saynez Mendoza as Secretary of Navy, Genaro 
Garcia Luna as Secretary of Public Security, and Eduardo 
Medina Mora as Attorney General.  These appointments 
completed Calderon's naming of the new Mexican Cabinet. 
Calderon announced his political cabinet selections on 
November 29 (ref A), social cabinet selections on November 24 
(ref B), and economic cabinet selections on November 20 (ref 
C).  Biographies of the security cabinet members follow. 
 
Guillermo Galvan Galvan, Secretary of Defense (SEDENA) 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  General Guillermo Galvan Galvan is a former head of 
the presidential guard (Estado Mayor Presidencial) and has 
been Deputy Secretary of Defense since March 2004.  He was 
the commander of the First Corps of the National Army, 
military attachQ at the Mexican Embassy to Spain, and 
Director of the Army College.  Born in 1953, he holds a 
Master's in National Security and Defense from the College of 
National Defense and a Bachelor's in Military Administration 
from the Mexican War College.  General Galvan's appointment 
appears to signal Calderon's wish to preserve continuity in 
the army.  He is considered well-disposed towards the U.S. 
and speaks English fluently. 
 
Mariano Francisco Saynez Mendoza, Secretary of Navy (SEMAR) 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Admiral Mariano Francisco Saynez Mendoza has served 
in the Mexican navy for 47 years, having held numerous 
command positions, including Commander of both the Navy's 
Pacific and Gulf forces.  He was also commanding director of 
the Center of Superior Naval Studies (CESNAV), served as 
Mexico's Naval Attache to both the U.S. and U.K., and was the 
Director of Security and Social Services of the Federal 
Forces Institute.  Born in 1942, he holds a degree in 
geographic engineering and did advanced studies in national 
security at CESNAV.  Admiral Saynez, who had a troubled 
relationship with the previous Secretary of the Navy, was a 
surprise choice and emerged as Calderon's selection after the 
press alleged that the front-runner's wife had family 
connections to narco-traffickers.  Admiral Saynez is 
considered well-disposed towards the U.S. and speaks English 
fluently. 
 
Eduardo Medina Mora Icaza:  Attorney General (PGR) 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4.  (U) Head of Public Safety (SSP) in the outgoing Fox 
cabinet, Calderon named Eduardo Medina Mora Attorney General 
of the Republic (PGR), Mexico's top law enforcement job.  His 
primary challenge will be combating narco-trafficking and 
organized crime.  Medina Mora is the only minister whose 
appointment has to be confirmed by the Senate; he was 
confirmed and sworn-in on Thursday, December 7. 
 
¶5. (U) Prior to serving as Secretary of Public Safety, Medina 
Mora was director of Mexico's intelligence agency CISEN 
(Centro de Investigacion y Seguridad Nacional) from December 
2000 to September 2005.  He has also held posts both in the 
public and private sector including Assistant Director of 
Grupo DESC (Desarollo Economico, S.C.); Corporate Director of 
Strategic Planning at DESC; attorney, Medina Mora and 
Associates; Coordinator of Assessors for the Undersecretary 
of Fisheries; Head of the Department of Promotion and 
Marketing at CONASUPO; advisor to the NAFTA negotiating team; 
legal advisor to the National Agriculture and Fisheries 
Board; and National Advisor to the Business Coordinating 
 
MEXICO 00006871  002 OF 003 
 
 
Council.  As Secretary of Public Safety, Medina Mora was 
MexicoQ,s lead on the Technical Secretariat of the Alliance 
for the Mexico-US Border, in addition to the Top-Level 
Mexico-Guatemala and Mexico-Belize Border Safety Groups.  He 
was also a principal negotiator of the North American 
Security and Prosperity Partnership treaty between the U.S., 
Mexico, and Canada. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Born on January 30, 1957 in Mexico City, Medina Mora 
graduated from UNAM with a law degree and is a member of the 
Mexican College of Attorneys, as well as the American Bar 
Association. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Comment:  Medina Mora is well- and favorably known 
to the law enforcement agencies represented at post, as well 
as to many Washington actors, from his terms during the Fox 
Administration at SSP and CISEN.  He is fluent -- if hesitant 
-- in English and has an easy manner in business settings. 
End Comment. 
 
Genaro Garcia Luna:  Secretary of Public Safety (SSP) 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶8.  (U) Calderon replaced Medina Mora as Secretary of Public 
Security with a law enforcement and security service 
official, Genaro Garcia Luna, who was Director of the Agency 
for Federal Investigations (AFI) from its creation in 2001. 
Garcia Luna was named Director General for Planning and 
Operations of the Federal Judicial Police (PJF) in December 
¶2000.  He helped devise a reorganization plan to transform 
the PJF force (highly tainted by corruption) into AFI 
(Agencia Federal de Investigaciones, a hybrid combination of 
FBI and DEA functions under one roof), a professional, 
investigative police force that operates under the Attorney 
General's office -- the name change became official in 
November 2001.  Before AFI, from 1998-2000 Garcia Luna served 
as General Coordinator of Intelligence for Crime Prevention 
in the Federal Preventive Police (PFP), a component of the 
Public Safety Secretariat.  He also served as Technical 
Secretary on the Prevention of Arms, Explosives, and 
 
SIPDIS 
Munitions Trafficking Subcommittee to the Mexico-U.S. High 
Level Contact Group.  From 1989-1998 he worked for the 
Mexico's intelligence agency (CISEN) where he served as 
Coordinator for the Terrorism Investigation Unit.  In 1989, 
he was promoted at CISEN to Deputy Director of Protection; 
Head of the Department of Technical Investigations, Office of 
Technical Services; and Investigator for the Office of 
Foreign Affairs. 
 
¶9. (U) Born on July 10, 1968 in Mexico City, Garcia Luna is a 
graduate of the Autonomous Metropolitan University, where he 
earned a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a 
Master's degree in Business Administration from the Instituto 
de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey. 
 
¶10. (C) Comment:  Garcia Luna has been a trusted liaison, 
partner and friend of the FBI since his days at the PFP.  He 
is a "big picture guy" and strategist, approaching issues and 
problems like the engineer that he is.  His personal 
reputation is very good, however that of some of his 
underlings has not been as favorable.  Embassy interlocutors 
describe Garcia Luna's personality as intense.  His Spanish 
is often mumbled and spoken at a staccato rate and hard to 
understand even for native speakers; his English capabilities 
are negligible.  His attitude toward the U.S. is friendly. 
 
¶11. (C)  Comment continued: Garcia Luna and Medina Mora are 
close personally and politically.  Having both of them at the 
top of the civilian security structure should help maintain 
the excellent cooperation that the USG law enforcement 
agencies enjoyed with the Fox administration.  Both men have 
been strong advocates of the need for significant 
restructuring of the federal police structure; Garcia Luna 
even wrote a book about it.  End Comment.
