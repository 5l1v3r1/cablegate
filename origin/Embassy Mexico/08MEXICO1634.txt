SUBJECT: ADDRESSING MEXICO'S PROBLEMATIC RESOLUTIONS ON 
"PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS WHILE COUNTERING TERRORISM" 
 
REF: STATE 53324 
 
Deputy Undersecretary Gomez Robledo was unavailable this past 
week, but Political Counselor discussed reftel contents with 
his special advisor.   Advisor said Gomez Robledo was well 
aware of U.S. concerns with regards to repeated tablings of 
Mexico's resolution on "Human Rights" While Combatting 
Terrorism" in multiple fora.  He was speaking with different 
Multi-lateral Affairs elements about how to address these 
concerns while preserving the intent of the resolution.  She 
did not comment on Political Counselor's suggestion that 
Mexico incorporate "life-extending" language into the OAS 
draft, but said SRE would pass on our comments to Mexico's 
delegation.   She suggested that a similar USG demarche be 
made to Mexico's UN delegation.  Subsequently, we spoke with 
Alejandro Negrin, SRE Director General for Human Rights, who 
claimed that Robledo had instructed Mexico's OAS delegation 
to work closely with ours and the outstanding differences 
over the current draft had been resolved.  Negrin was less 
positive about Mexico refraining from introducing the 
resolution in subsequent years, claiming that other 
(unspecified) states wanted to review this issue on a yearly 
basis.
