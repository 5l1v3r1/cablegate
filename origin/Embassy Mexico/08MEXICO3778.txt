SUBJECT: MEXICO ON FORMER PRESIDENT ERNESTO ZEDILLO'S 
"CANDIDACY" FOR IAEA DIRECTOR GENERAL 
 
REF: MADRID 001262 
 
(SBU) Poloff contacted Julian Juarez Cadenas, the Deputy 
Director General for UN-Related Security and Legal Issues at 
the Foreign Secretariat (SRE), December 19 to discuss the 
prospect that former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo could 
be considered as a successor to the current IAEA Director 
General, Mohamed ElBaradei, whose term expires in summer 2009 
(reftel).  Juarez said that the Spanish representative to the 
IAEA had mentioned this possibility to Mexico.  Juarez also 
believed that the incumbent DG supported Zedillo's candidacy. 
 He said that Zedillo might consider taking the position, but 
that he first wanted to see the reaction of the Board of 
Governors to candidates from South Africa, Japan and any 
other countries.  Pending those results, Juarez said that the 
Govermnent of Mexico at this time was not/not promoting a 
Zedillo candidacy.
