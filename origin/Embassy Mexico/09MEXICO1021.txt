Â¶1. (C) Poloff conveyed points in response to North Korea's 
launch of a long-range missile (reftel) to Fernando Gonzalez, 
SRE,s Deputy UN Director General for Security Council 
Affairs.  Gonzalez said the Government of Mexico (GOM) was 
concerned by North Korea's launch and considered it a threat 
to peace and stability in the Korean peninsula.  He noted 
that China and Russia are reluctant to support a security 
council resolution against North Korea and indicated that the 
GOM supported the six party talks.
