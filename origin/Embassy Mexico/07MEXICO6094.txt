Deputy Political Counselor met with Julian Juarez, the Deputy 
Director of the Foreign Ministry's UN Office on Peace and 
International Security, December 6, to share the key findings 
of the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iran's 
nuclear program and to stress the importance we attach to 
continued pressure on Iran to meet its international 
obligations.  While Juarez welcomed notice that Iran had 
halted weaponization-related activities in 2003, he 
registered concern that the report confirms Iran had been 
involved in those activities until that date.  He took on 
board the role international pressure had played on Iran's 
decision to suspend its activities and remarked that Mexico 
would continue to urge that Iran comply with its 
international obligations.
