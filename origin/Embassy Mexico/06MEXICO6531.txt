¶1.  (SBU) On November 16, poloff passed ref A talking points 
to Minister Dolores Jimenez, Deputy Director General for UN 
Affairs at the Secretariat for Foreign Relations (SRE).  Post 
notes that historically, Mexico has proven a fairly reliable 
vote against Israel in UN bodies, and we do not expect any 
response we receive from the GOM to this demarche to be 
favorable. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: In a May 2006 campaign appearance before 
Mexico's Jewish community (ref B), then-candidate Calderon 
lamented that there had been "a terrible deficiency" in 
Mexico's Middle East policy, epitomized by the GOM's history 
of reflexively supporting anti-Israel resolutions in 
international fora.  He pledged that if he were elected, the 
GOM would no longer maintain an a priori position on Middle 
East-related resolutions and would consider each one on its 
own merits.  It remains to be seen whether, once Calderon 
assumes office, he is able to overcome the SRE's entrenched 
bias in favor of the Arabs, and implement a more independent 
policy on these issues.
