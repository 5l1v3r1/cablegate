1.(U)  Summary:  Chengdu veterans of General Stilwell's army in 
the Burma-India Theater presented commemorative medals to the 
Consulate and spoke of the importance of remembrance and keeping 
the memory alive.  The veterans complain that their history has 
often been ignored and that the region lacks military cemeteries 
for China's World War II veterans.   The veterans group hopes to 
raise money for a museum in Chengdu so that the memory of the 
veterans of the Burma-India Theater will survive them. 
 
 
 
Keeping the Memory Alive: Comradeship with American Allies

¶2.  (U)   Drinking tea with Acting Consul General and Congenoff 
in Chengdu's People's Park, a dozen veterans, all over eighty 
years old, spoke of the great appreciation the people of 
Southwest China have for the Flying Tigers and the protection 
they provided to Chengdu and other interior cities against the 
Japanese.  The veterans demonstrated the A-OK thumbs-up sign 
they learned from American comrades-in-arms.   They recalled 
their American teachers in Stilwell's army, the American food 
they ate every day, and the American tanks and weapons they 
fought with.   The commemorative medal the veterans presented to 
the Consulate reads "That we fought bravely to kill the enemy 
and that we defeated the Japanese invaders - these are our 
greatest glory.  Medal struck by the Chinese National Resistance 
Army and their descendants and by the Chinese India Burma 
Expeditionary Army.   September 3, 2005."  In the center of the 
medal is a picture of General Stilwell.

¶3. (U) The veterans said they were disappointed that many young 
people today do not know their story and that there are no 
graveyards and memorials in China honoring the Burma-India 
campaign veterans.  One of the veterans, Huang Shaopu, told of 
being asked during a 2005 interview with Asia Week (Hong Kong) 
if there are reminders of the Flying Tigers and the American 
wartime presence in Chengdu.  Huang said he had to tell the 
reporter that nothing remains in Chengdu from those days.  Huang 
said that there should be a museum to educate people about the 
sacrifices of the soldiers who fought in the Burma-India 
campaign.  The group told the Consulate that it hopes the United 
States could help.  They gave the Consulate a group photograph 
they had taken with an American veteran of the Burma-India 
Theater who had visited them in October 2008. 
 
 
 
Keeping the Memory Alive: Books 
 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) In this and a June encounter with the veterans at the 
Jianchuan Museum in Dayi, Chengdu to dedicate an exhibit to U.S. 
flyers, the veterans enthusiastically recommended recent books 
on the Burma-India campaign and the U.S. Army Air Force in China 
which they presented to the Consulate General: 
 
-- In 2005, Xu Wen, a Chinese Burma-India Theater veteran and 
graduate of Sichuan University, edited in five volumes 
interviews with over 100 veterans together with an additional 20 
accounts written by individual veterans themselves.  The book, 
entitled "Hot Blood, Expeditionary Army - Revealing the Secrets 
of China's Expeditionary Army" [Rexue, yuanzheng - zhongguo 
yuanzhengjun dajiemi] was published by the Dazhong Wenyi 
Chubanshe, 2006. 
 
-- "Superfortresses: B-29 in China - Documentary account of 
fight of the U.S. Army 20th Air Force in China" [Chaobao Dui: 
Meiguo Lujun diershi hangkongdui fuhua zuozhan ziliaoji]. 
Edited by Li Xiaowei, three volumes,  Tianma Book Company, Ltd. 
, Hong Kong  (contact: b29inchina(at)yahoo.com.cn) 
 
--" The Story of General Sun Liren - An Account of the Chinese 
Newly Organized First Army in the India Burma Theater in the War 
of Resistance Against Japan",  [Sun Liren jiangchunzhuan] edited 
by Xue Qingyu, published by Neimenggu Chubanshe, 2000. 
 
 
 
Keeping the Memory Alive: Old War Stories Are Less Sensitive Now

¶5.  (U) This visit with the Burma-India Theater veterans was the 
sort of reminder of US-Chinese friendship one regularly 
encounters in Southwest China.  As the history surrounding the 
period becomes less politically sensitive, Chinese television 
dramas about World War II depict soldiers dressed in Republic of 
China uniforms defending their country against the Japanese 
invaders.  In earlier decades, such portrayals of military 
heroism would be reserved for communist guerilla fighters or for 
the Red Army.  The veterans complained that many young people 
today do not know about the sacrifices they made in the 
Burma-India Theater.  The veterans hope that their story and 
sacrifices will receive more attention in the coming years.
