¶1. (U) This cable contains business confidential information, 
not for distribution on the Internet. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary: U.S.-based Western Water Group (WWG) confirmed 
to CG that China lags behind its own goals for wastewater 
treatment.  While WWG has been quite successful in winning 
contracts to build new plants, many local governments fail to 
build the necessary water pipe systems to which the plants can 
connect, resulting in plants running at low capacity or being 
fully stopped.  Competition from other firms is intense, 
particularly from the French, but pressure for bribes has been 
nonexistent in WWG's experience.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Representatives of U.S.-based Western Water Group (WWG) 
and parent company Han's Technologies briefed CG and PolEconOff 
August 12 in Kunming (Yunnan Province) on WWG's experience 
building wastewater treatment and water treatment plants in 
Southwest China.  Established in 2002 in Guizhou Province as a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of Oakland CA-based Han's Technologies, 
WWG invests in and operates municipal wastewater treatment 
plants and water treatment plants using both 
build-operate-transfer (BOT) and transfer-operate-transfer (TOT) 
business models.  In Southwest China, WWG currently has 10 BOT 
contracts signed in Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces, as well as 
eight additional projects in Sichuan and Yunnan currently under 
negotiation.  (Note: WWG also currently has six signed contracts 
in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Fujian Provinces.  TOT is where an 
investor buys property and operational rights of a facility, 
receives returns through normal business operations within a 
concession period, and then transfers the facility back to its 
original owner for no cost at the end of the concession period. 
End Note.) 
 
 
 
China Short of Wastewater Treatment Goals 
 
----------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to WWG, a longer-term goal of the central 
government is to have 50-60 percent coverage for wastewater 
treatment facilities throughout China, with 100 percent coverage 
in cities and 40 percent in rural areas.  The Ministry of 
Construction, as part of China's 11th Five-Year Plan, required 
that by 2010 the municipal wastewater treatment rate should not 
be lower than 70 percent, and all cities and counties should 
establish or plan to establish centralized wastewater treatment 
facilities.  Reftel notes that, according to "official 
statistics," only 55 percent of wastewater was being treated as 
of 2007.  Yunnan Province's 2008-2012 plan for expanding and 
building wastewater treatment plants foresees spending 21.3 
billion RMB on 248 projects, according to a May 2009 Kunming 
news report. 
 
 
 
Have Treatment Plants, Need Water Pipes 
 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) While WWG has been successful in winning bids to build 
wastewater treatment plants, the projects face a critical 
difficulty in that many Chinese cities are slow to build piping 
systems.  With no water system to connect to, many of WWG's 
plants are operating at only 30-40 percent capacity, and some 
are not operational at all.  Local governments often want 
companies building wastewater treatment plants to build the 
city's pipe systems as well, but "no investor will touch pipes," 
WWG said.  While WWG encourages local governments to fulfill 
their contractual commitments, some local governments have been 
compelled to buy back the WWG plants earlier than anticipated in 
the original contracts, e.g. because they failed to build the 
needed piping systems and thus have no billing revenues.  WWG 
attempts to be lenient, sometimes agreeing to alter contracts 
when local governments cannot hold up their end in the near

term.  "WWG has to make money, but doesn't have to make money 
now," reps said. 
 
 
 
Heated Competition, Particularly French 
 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) WWG reported that they face 10-15 competitors in each 
plant negotiation, including both local and international 
companies.  They made special mention of French competition, 
particularly Veolia, with French competitors receiving 
substantial support from the French Government.  According to 
WWG, Veolia tends to overpay on the price of contracts in order 
to secure them, and then later raises water tariffs to cover the 
loss - often significantly more than originally "anticipated." 
As local officials tend not to be in power more than four years, 
WWG said, they are not concerned whether water tariffs will be 
raised later. 
 
 
 
No Pressure for Bribery 
 
----------------------- 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) WWG claimed that they have never been asked by local 
officials for bribes, or to engage in corrupt practices.  Some 
WWG projects have involved local officials who then were 
detained for corruption in later deals, WWG reps said, but 
subsequent investigations into these officials' previous 
dealings have always exonerated WWG.  In order to insulate 
itself from claims of being involved with corrupt officials in 
the future, WWG is lobbying in Guiyang (Guizhou Province) for 
more oversight by the Communist Party's anti-bribery committees. 
 (Note: these disciplinary committees investigate high-level 
officials and, as Party bodies, do not go through the normal 
system of prosecutors under the Ministry of Justice. End Note.)
