¶1.  (U) On June 3, Southwest China's Yunnan Province experienced 
an earthquake measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale.  The quake hit 
Pu'er City, close to Yunnan's southern border with Burma, 
killing at least three, injuring 313, and leaving more than 
180,000 people displaced, according to Chinese official press 
reports. 
 
¶2.  (U) The region, famed for tea, has reportedly since been 
rocked by "1,253" aftershocks, three of which measured more than 
three on the Richter scale with the largest at 5.1. Experts have 
warned of the possibility of more. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Yunnan Foreign Affairs Office (FAO) confirmed to us 
some of the information contained in Chinese press reports.  An 
official we spoke to on June 4 claimed a "few" people had died 
and that "less than three dozen" were injured.  When asked if 
the FAO had received any reports of injured or missing 
Americans, the official said Pu'er was a rural and relatively 
sparsely populated tea producing area, and that as far as they 
knew, no foreigners were injured. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Although initially hesitant to provide information to 
us, the Ning'er County Earthquake Relieve Office eventually told 
us on June 5 that the earthquake left three people dead and 329 
people injured, 17 of them seriously.  As reported in the press, 
the official confirmed that 180,000 people had been moved to 
temporary simple houses or tents in the area. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The Relief Office also indicated approximately 530,000 
people living in the immediate area have been affected by the 
earthquake.  Over 360,000 houses are damaged in some way. 
Additionally, many other facilities including highways, power 
supply and telecommunication networks, and schools have been 
destroyed. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Many Pu'er tea factories have had to stop production. 
The Relief Office estimates the direct economic loss to be 
approximately 2.5 billion RMB (USD 323 million).  Following the 
earthquake, Pu'er has received relief materials and funds from 
the central government and other provinces.
