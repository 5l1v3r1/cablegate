¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The development of highway links between Yunnan 
province and Vietnam is moving slowly on the Vietnam side, a 
Vietnam Consul in Kunming told Consular Officer.  This slowness, 
and the earlier completion of the Bangkok-Kunming highway (and 
corresponding expansion of Thailand-Yunnan trade), made the 
Consul concerned that Vietnam would be "left behind" other ASEAN 
countries in its trade with China.  A number of U.S. food 
exporters are interesting in developing a cold storage 
logistical chain when the road from Haiphong to Kunming is 
completed.  Tran also discussed Vietnam-China border trade and 
current demand for visas to Vietnam in Southwest China.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
Vietnam's Highway Links to Kunming 
 
Moving Forward, But Slow Progress is a Concern 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) On November 18, ConOff met with Vietnam Consul Tran Kim 
Bang at the Vietnam Consulate General in Kunming, Yunnan 
Province.  While the primary purpose of the visit was to discuss 
consular issues in Southwest China, ConOff and Tran also 
discussed Kunming's highway links with Vietnam.  According to 
press reports, in 2007 the Asian Development Bank approved a 1.1 
billion USD loan to Vietnam to develop a road from Kunming to 
Haiphong, Vietnam, which is the closest deep water port to 
Kunming.  Press reports state that the planned highway would cut 
the trip from Kunming to Hanoi from 2-3 days to less than a day, 
and that the planned completion date for the road was 2012. 
According to recent information posted on the Asian Development 
Bank's Greater Mekong Subregion website, the Chinese side of the 
Kunming-Haiphong highway should be completed in 2010. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to Tran, increasing road and rail links 
between Vietnam and Yunnan province have been hampered by the 
cost of improving road infrastructure in Vietnam.  He stated 
that both sides have the desire to improve highway links between 
Yunnan and Vietnam, but that he did not know when the 
Kunming/Haiphong project would be completed.  According to 
Tran's colleagues in Hanoi, funding concerns may be an issue in 
completion of the Kunming/Haiphong highway.  In July, 2009, the 
Vietnam Expressway Corporation failed for the fourth time in a 
month in a corporate bond sale, Tran said. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Tran also stated his concern that the slowness in 
completing the Kunming to Haiphong highway might have a negative 
impact on Vietnam, causing it to become "left behind" other 
ASEAN neighbors in its trade with China. 
 
 
 
Vietnam's Trade with China: Promising, Focused on Border 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) Tran stated that Vietnam has a number of advantages in 
trade with China, including geographic location, and a positive, 
on-going dialogue between leaders of Vietnam and China on 
economic ties.  Trade between Vietnam and Yunnan province, 
according to Tran, is currently focused at Vietnam/China border 
cities.  (Note: According to Chinese press reports, China and 
Vietnam recently signed an agreement officially demarcating 
their 1,300-kilometer land boundary, and agreed to further land 
border cooperation.  End Note.) 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) Tran said that Yunnan exports a number of agricultural 
products to Vietnam, and that Vietnam also exports fruit and 
other agricultural products to Yunnan.  Tran also stated that, 
after the planned road links between Kunming and Vietnam are 
completed, Yunnan would also be able to import seafood from 
Vietnam's coast.

U.S. Ag Exporters Interested in Cold Storage Logistical Chain 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
 
 
¶8. (U) According to ConGen Chengdu's Senior Commercial Officer 
(SCO), who was recently posted in Ho Chi Minh City, development 
of a cold storage logistical chain from Haiphong to Kunming was 
hampered by the lack adequate highway infrastructure.  A number 
of U.S. food exporters are interesting in developing such a 
logistics network when the road from Haiphong to Kunming is 
completed, the SCO said. 
 
 
 
Applications for Visas to Vietnam Lower 
 
In Kunming Compared to Vietnam's Other China Posts 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
 
9 (SBU) Tran also discussed his office's demand for visas to 
Vietnam.  According to Tran, despite Kunming's proximity to 
Vietnam, his office in Kunming sees far less demand for visas to 
Vietnam than Vietnam's Embassy in Beijing and Vietnam's 
Consulates in Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Nanning.  Tran stated 
that the Vietnamese Consulate General in Kunming processes about 
50 Vietnamese visas a day, and that many of the applicants are 
third-county nationals who plan to travel from Kunming to 
Vietnam by bus.  Tran attributed the lower demand to Kunming's 
lower level of economic development compared to China's coastal 
regions.  Tran stated that last year's global economic downturn 
depressed demand for Vietnamese visas, but that he expects 
longer-term growth in visa demand.
