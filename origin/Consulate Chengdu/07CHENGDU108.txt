¶1. (U) SUMMARY: China's voluntary health insurance scheme, the 
Rural Cooperative Medical System (RCMS) was designed to make 
healthcare more accessible and affordable for the poor, 
particularly in the event of catastrophic illness. However, as 
the RCMS expands to reach the poorest areas, many communities do 
not have sufficient medical and administrative personnel to meet 
an increased demand for healthcare services or to manage costs 
and design reimbursement strategies. As a result, areas such as 
Sichuan Province's impoverished rural Nanxi county, may face 
difficulties fulfilling its public pledges of free annual health 
screenings, immediate partial reimbursement of fees, and 
additional compensation for large medical bills. These promises 
were essential to attract initial high participation rates from 
farmers, but if the scheme fails to deliver, there will be 
rising resentment and reduced future enrollments as people grow 
disillusioned and withdraw from a scheme that is not addressing 
their needs. This is the third and last in a series of cables 
examining local healthcare in China. End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
DON'T MAKE PROMISES YOU CAN'T KEEP 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) During a recent reporting trip to rural Nanxi County in 
southern Sichuan, Emboffs and Congenoff visited township 
hospitals and rural clinics.  Four years after the RCMS was 
launched with much fanfare, promising to address the twin 
problems of "seeing a doctor is difficult, seeing a doctor is 
expensive" (kan bing nan, kan bing gui) in rural areas, local 
officials are under pressure to show high RCMS participation 
rates, a principal yardstick which the central government uses 
to measure local government success. To boost participation, 
some impoverished local governments may over-promise RCMS 
benefits to attract participants and prove that their program is 
a success. However, inadequate government funding along with 
insufficient numbers of skilled personnel means these areas may 
not be able to deliver on their promises. 
 
¶3. (U) Rural Nanxi county, a six hour drive from Sichuan's 
provincial capital Chengdu, has a per capita annual income of 
3,000 RMB (388 USD) and boasts a RCMS enrollment rate of 90 
percent among the 420,000 county residents, up from 65 percent 
in 2005. Each participant in Nanxi's RCMS must contribute 10 RMB 
(1.3 USD) annually which is matched by 10 RMB (1.3 USD) from the 
central government, the province, the county, and district, 
amounting to a total contribution of 50 RMB (6.5 USD) for each 
enrollee. Local officials attribute the high participation rate 
to innovative offerings that include free participation in RCMS 
for the poor, free annual health inspections, quick 
reimbursements, and supplementary coverage of between 30 and 50 
percent for participants who incur medical bills of over 10,000 
RMB (1,280 USD). During a carefully scripted presentation 
outside a township hospital in Nanxi that serves 51,000 
residents, officials showed us slick billboards demonstrating 
how usage of inpatient facilities tripled between 2004 and 2006 
because RCMS has made inpatient care more affordable. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In a departure from an otherwise stage-managed event, 
while officials were touting their achievements, an elderly man 
amidst the crowd of onlookers started protesting loudly before 
he was dragged away by local public security officials. He 
complained that the officials were liars, that the RCMS was a 
hoax, and that he had not received any reimbursement promised to 
him after waiting more than seven months. Other residents later 
privately commented that they were skeptical of official 
promises to address their healthcare needs and noted that they 
had never seen the billboards publicizing the benefits the 
public was supposed to enjoy until our visit. 
 
------------------------------ 
A SHORTAGE OF TALENT AND MONEY 
------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) Because Nanxi claims a high RCMS enrollment rate and says 
demand for inpatient care has rapidly risen, the central 
government spent more than 300,000 RMB (39,000 USD) in 2007 to 
 
CHENGDU 00000108  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
construct a new wing for the township hospital. Nanxi, however, 
has not hired any additional medical staff to meet the rising 
demand for inpatient care. Nanxi also has a network of 309 
public health institutions to serve its 420,000 residents but 
most of these facilities have one or two rudimentarily trained 
staff that only handles simple tasks such as diagnosing colds, 
administering vaccinations and dispensing drugs. 
 
¶6. (U) An acute shortage in the countryside of accountants and 
administrators to conduct actuarial forecasts, determine 
reimbursement strategies, and ensure cost containment also 
threatens the long-term viability of this program. Local 
communities such as Nanxi do not have the skilled staff 
necessary to perform complex calculations for the level of 
contributions the RCMS needs to be financially solvent, nor have 
they determined the current and future costs for the benefits 
they are now offering.  Yanfeng Ge, a Deputy Director General of 
the State Council's Development Research Center separately told 
us that the 50 RMB (6.5 USD) collected in places like Nanxi are 
only sufficient to cover an estimated 20 percent of healthcare 
costs, making it critical that these places conduct actuarial 
estimates and implement rigorous cost controls before extending 
benefits. However, it is unclear if rural communities can 
compete with wealthier cities and towns to attract the skilled 
technical staff in a country that already has a shortage of such 
talent. 
 
------------------------------ 
IS THE RCMS ROLLOUT TOO RAPID? 
------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (U) As China rapidly extends RCMS from 50 percent of counties 
at the end of 2006 to 80 percent of counties by the end of 2007, 
the fact that many rural areas do not have the healthcare 
workers or administrators to address healthcare needs or manage 
the RCMS could leave farmers dissatisfied with the level of 
care, or find the program teetering into bankruptcy. During our 
meeting with Sichuan Academy of Social Science (SASS) scholars, 
they stated the focus on increasing coverage areas was misguided 
because many of the communities that are now supposed to 
implement RCMS are among the poorest and have the least capacity 
to manage or implement such a program. 
 
¶8. (U) While it may be politically expedient to embark on an 
ambitious rollout so that one can boast of high national 
coverage rates, if the Central Government is sincere about 
addressing the population's healthcare needs, it may need to 
slow the expansion to give local communities time to find and 
train the staff needed to provide a sustainable, improved 
quality of service.
