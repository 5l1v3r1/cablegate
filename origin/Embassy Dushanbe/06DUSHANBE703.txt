SUBJECT: TAJIK GOVERNMENT ENACTS HOUSEHOLD EXCESS ELECTRICITY RATE 
 
REF: DUSHANBE 668 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Please handle accordingly.  Not 
for public Internet. 
 
¶1. (U) According to media reports, the Tajik Anti-Monopoly 
Committee approved on April 11 an excess electricity consumption 
rate above 250 kWh per month for private households retroactive 
to  the beginning of April.  The base electricity rate remains 
the same at 0.5 cent.  Per reftel, the 0.5 cent rate is at 
approximately 24 percent of the "cost recovery rate" for 
Tajikistan currently to produce and distribute electricity.  The 
new excess electricity consumption rate of 0.9 cent is 
approximately 43 percent of the cost recovery rate. 
 
¶2. (U) An informal survey of Embassy local staff indicates on 
average they consume 1,000 kWh per month.  However, local 
Embassy personnel are wealthier than the average Tajik and 
likely use more electricity in their residences in general.  The 
250 kWh cap for the very cheap rate for power ensures that a 
lower rate still is available for everyday needs in the typical 
household. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT:  The government kept this excess electricity 
consumption rate change under wraps, despite numerous recent 
meetings with PolOff on the very subject, and may have announced 
this leading in to the summer when electricity usage drops. 
While this is a good first step towards regulating tariffs, the 
electricity rates for industry and private businesses remain 
unchanged at their low levels.  In addition, overall rates in 
Tajikistan remain below the cost recovery rate, and this excess 
consumption rate is unlikely to significantly reduce usage by 
households that already are above the median income.  Moreover, 
there are serious gaps in collection, and it remains to be seen 
how many people will still be able to "beat the system."  END 
COMMENT.
