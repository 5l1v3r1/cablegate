SUBJECT: IN TAJIKISTAN, THIS WEEK'S MEDIA BOUT GOES TO IRAN 
 
¶1.  Groundbreaking for the Iran-funded Sangtuda-2 hydropower 
station dominated weekly press coverage, from Tajik and Russian 
Internet agencies to radio, television, and print media news 
outlets.  This followed heavy government and independent media 
attention on last week's announcement of the imminent completion 
of the Iran-funded Anzob tunnel linking southern Tajikistan with 
its northern territory. 
 
¶2.  In recent weeks, the government-owned media, including Tajik 
television stations, has given Iran the heavy coverage and 
positive press it usually gives to Russia.  Concerning 
Sangtuda-2, President Rahmonov stated, "This is not Iran's last 
contribution . . . Tajikistan and Iran have resumed cooperation 
after a hiatus of many years.  Iran was among the first 
countries to recognize the independence of Tajikistan." 
Rahmonov lauded the "billion kilowatt hours a year" that 
Sangtuda-2 should produce and the great help that Iran is to the 
people of Tajikistan. 
 
¶3.  In addition to these two Iranian building projects, the 
Tajik media recently began to highlight Iranian Ambassador to 
Tajikistan Nosir Sarmadi Porso's political statements about 
Iran's right to possess nuclear energy and a host of issues not 
specifically concerning Tajik-Iranian bilateral interests. 
Tajik and Iranian political leaders alike never fail to mention 
the close historical and linguistic similarities between the two 
nations. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT:  Local Embassy staff were the first to pick up on 
the shift in media attention on Iran, noting the daily 
television coverage, front-page newspaper articles, and the 
elevation of Tajik-Iranian relations, from construction to 
high-level visits.  In addition to the rhetoric of culture 
closeness, Iran is letting its investments speak for its 
relations with Tajikistan - Sangtuda-2 and the Anzob Tunnel will 
cost hundreds of millions to complete over the next few years - 
and the Tajik media, directed and independent are paying 
attention.  END COMMENT.
