SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED ON TRAVEL RESTRICTION REQUIREMENTS IN 
UNSCRS 1737, 1747, 1803 
 
REF: STATE 033674 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolOff and ConOff delivered the demarche on UNSCRs 1737, 
1747 and 1803 to Yatimsho Musofirov, the Deputy Head of the Consular 
Department of the Tajik Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  We gave 
Musofirov a non-paper detailing the points raised in reftel, and 
described the measures the United States is taking to ensure a de 
facto travel ban on all designated officials.  Musofirov said he 
would forward the information we provided to the appropriate 
offices.  He was not in a position to comment specifically on 
Tajikistan's efforts to implement the provisions. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Musofirov did explain, however, that the State Committee on 
National Security is charged with overall implementation of travel 
restrictions.  In situations such as this, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs would alert the State Committee about the travel provisions, 
and the State Committee would enter the information into a computer 
system that officials use to screen those who enter the country. 
The computer system is linked to those used by the other members of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States; names and information 
entered by other former Soviet countries would automatically be 
included in this system. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Musofirov mentioned that some border posts do not have 
access to the computer system (Note: in fact, only the Dushanbe 
International Airport is currently connected.)  This is not 
necessarily a defect in the system, as Iranians need visas to enter 
the country, and Tajik consular officers abroad have access to the 
necessary information through the Consular Department (with whom 
they would need to consult). 
 
¶4. (SBU) Musofirov also told us about the Ministry's plans to seek 
assistance from the International Organization for Migration, World 
Bank, Turkish Embassy, and other potential donors to improve 
computer and information systems.  We have nominated Musofirov for 
an International Visitor Leadership Program on consular issues 
scheduled for June, but he does not yet know whether he will be 
allowed to participate.
