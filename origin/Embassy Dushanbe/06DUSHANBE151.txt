SUBJECT: RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR KICKS OFF TAJIKISTAN'S 2006 PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION 
 
¶1.  Although President Emomali Rahmonov has not officially 
announced that he will be a candidate for the late 2006 
presidential election in Tajikistan, Russian Ambassador Ramazan 
Abdulatipov more than endorsed him at a press conference on 
January 24.  According to multiple press reports, he said, "We 
openly affirm that no one but Rahmonov will be able to work in 
this position." 
 
¶2.  At a Tajik Border Guard event on January 27, an Interfax 
reporter asked the U.S. Ambassador, "Ambassador Abdulatipov 
supports President Rahmonov for the next election.  Do you?" 
The Ambassador replied that the United States supports the 
democratic political process, not personalities, and hopes that 
the forthcoming election will meet international standards.  The 
reporter rejoined, "So you don't support President Rahmonov?" 
 
¶3.  COMMENT:  So much for the quaint diplomatic tradition of not 
overtly interfering in the internal electoral affairs of a host 
country.  In fact, Rahmonov is still generally popular in 
Tajikistan, and there appears to be no other viable candidate at 
this time.  However, Russia's ham-fisted support for Rahmonov, 
especially this early before the election, could come back to 
haunt Moscow.  END COMMENT.
