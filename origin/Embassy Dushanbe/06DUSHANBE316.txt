DIPLOMACY OF COOPERATION 
 
 
¶1.  U.S. Ambassador Hoagland and Russian Ambassador Ramazan 
Abdulatipov jointly presented certificates to the first 15 
graduates of the U.S.-funded Ministry of Interior Criminal 
Intelligence Analytical Center February 17 in Dushanbe.  With 
INL funding, the United States renovated and equipped the center 
and paid for the Swiss-Russian firm Avicomp to provide the 
professional training in criminal analysis. 
 
¶2.  Ambassador Hoagland emphasized the important symbolism of 
U.S.-Russian cooperation to further professionalize Tajikistan's 
ability to fight trans-national crime.  Ambassador Abdulatipov 
placed the cooperation within the context of President Putin's 
G-8 counter-terrorism initiative.  A large number of Tajik, 
Russian, and other international journalists covered the event. 
 
¶3.  An identical U.S.-funded project is under way at 
Tajikistan's Drug Control Agency.  It is intended that the 
criminal intelligence analysis program will expand to all Tajik 
law-enforcement and security ministries before the end of 2007. 
This professional upgrade will allow Tajikistan to participate 
in CARICC when it is eventually established in Almaty, as well 
as to share information with other countries in the region.  The 
U.S.-funded country-wide Harris communication system will add 
microwave capability for wireless encryption data transmission 
to all regions of Tajikistan. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT:  The joint U.S.-Russia ceremony was the brainchild 
of DCM Dushanbe and a result of the hard work of both DCMs.  We 
are pleased that Ambassador Abdulatipov agreed to participate in 
such an event, the first time ever we have been able concretely 
to show U.S.-Russian security cooperation in Tajikistan.  If the 
Russian media report this event, it will be a small dose of 
antidote against the poison of "Great Game propaganda."  END 
COMMENT.
