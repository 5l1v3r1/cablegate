¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  At the Hesse SPD/Social Democratic Party state 
convention December 2, party chairperson Andrea Ypsilanti edged out 
centrist Caucus Chief Juergen Walter for the right to challenge 
Hesse Minister-President Roland Koch (CDU/Christian Democrats) in 
January 2008.  Walter, who had won in local straw polls and tied in 
the first official ballot, narrowly lost to the more established 
Ypsilanti.  Koch remains a heavy favorite against left-wing 
flag-bearer Ypsilanti -- especially given this weekend's show of 
disarray -- but with more than 13 months until state elections, she 
could close the gap.  END SUMMARY.

Ypsilanti in Words 
------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) Ypsilanti -- known throughout Germany for her opposition to 
the former Schroeder government's "Agenda 2010" reform program -- 
focused on what she called "soft topics" (social policy, the family, 
and education) which Koch's conservative administration had 
neglected in favor of focusing on the economy.  As a single working 
mother, Ypsilanti said, she draws on personal experience of family 
needs in education and the economy.  In one of several references to 
French presidential candidate and mother-of-four Segolene Royal, she 
endorsed Royal's phrase "I know life so I know politics." 
Acknowledging her own left-wing record, Ypsilanti argued that voters 
want a clear choice and respect a politician with the courage of her 
convictions.  Walter, normally a stronger debater than Ypsilanti, 
struggled to match her personal appeal and connection with the party 
base.  (NOTE: A Consulate representative attended the convention -

A Photo Finish

¶3. (SBU) The charismatic, pro-business Walter came into the 
convention the slight favorite, having won 18 of 26 straw polls at 
regional party organizations.  The two candidates tied in the first 
official ballot (172:172), but Ypsilanti prevailed narrowly in the 
second ballot (175:165).  After the vote, SPD national Chairman Kurt 
Beck praised Ypsilanti but struggled to adapt a speech evidently 
written for Walter's expected victory.  The SPD's disarray was 
highlighted by subsequent board elections, where Ypsilanti faired 
worse than Walter (77.95% versus 85.9%).

What It Means for 2008 
---------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Tainted by ties to left-wing unionists and activists, 
insiders see Ypsilanti's victory over Walter as a boon for the 
conservative Koch in January 2008 state elections.  In reality, it 
is too early to count the SPD out:  the CDU (elected in 1999 and 
with an absolute majority since 2003) bears sole political 
responsibility for the state's economy and for an education system 
that still compares unfavorably with neighboring states.  Koch is a 
formidable candidate but has political vulnerabilities including 
campaign funding improprieties (reftel).  In the meantime, the Hesse 
SPD -- a party divided exactly in half, as demonstrated this weekend 
-- has its work cut out for it.
