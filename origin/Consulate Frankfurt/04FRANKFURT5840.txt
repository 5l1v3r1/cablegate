¶1.  SUMMARY:  Continuing an annual tradition, the state of 
Baden-Wuerttemberg and the German-American Institute in 
cooperation with ConGen Frankfurt held a high-profile 
Independence Day reception in Stuttgart for three hundred 
German guests.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  On July 1, the James F. Byrnes German-American 
Institute celebrated Independence Day on the Stuttgart 
compound of SWR (Germany's second largest TV broadcaster). 
The event was well attended with over three hundred guests 
including dignitaries from government, business, and U.S. 
and German military.  The B-W state government and the city 
of Stuttgart -- which together give the Byrnes Institute 
approx. EUR 250,000 support per year -- have co-sponsored 
the event since the closure of ConGen Stuttgart in 1996. 
 
¶3.  Keynote speakers (including the Consul General, State 
Secretary Rudolf Boehmler and Stuttgart Lord Mayor Wolfgang 
 
SIPDIS 
Schuster), highlighted the state's strong ties to the 
United States including U.S. military based in the state. 
State and local politicians committed to do everything 
possible to keep U.S. armed forces in Baden-Wuerttemberg. 
High-level EUCOM attendance and the performance of a EUCOM 
color guard gave the event a traditional July 4th flavor. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT: Stuttgart papers gave very positive coverage 
to this unique annual event reflecting enduring U.S.-German 
friendship in the state.  END COMMENT.
