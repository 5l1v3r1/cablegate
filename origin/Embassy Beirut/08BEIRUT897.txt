SUBJECT: LEBANON: PARTICIPATION IN THE FAO/WHO CODEX ALIMENTARIUS 
COMMISSION IN GENEVA (JUNE 30 - JULY 4, 2008) 
 
REF: STATE 50336 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) The entity that represents Lebanon at the FAO/WHO Codex 
Alimentarius Commission is the Lebanese Standards Institution, known 
by the acronym LIBNOR.  Currently, political parties in Lebanon are 
negotiating formation of a new cabinet.  Given  that travel expenses 
to attend the commission meeting must be approved by the cabinet, no 
decision has been taken yet as to whether Lebanese representatives 
will attend the upcoming commission in Geneva.  In case travel is 
approved, Lebanon would be represented by LIBNOR Chairman of the 
Board Mr. Habib Ghaziri and Ms. Lena Dergham from LIBNOR.
