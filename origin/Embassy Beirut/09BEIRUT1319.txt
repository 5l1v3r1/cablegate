ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS ISSUE 
BEIRUT CALL TO COPENHAGEN 
----------------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) A group of Lebanese parliamentarians, Lebanese NGOs, and 
the local UNDP office issued the "Beirut call to Copenhagen" calling 
on world leaders to approve an "ambitious, binding and fair 
agreement in Copenhagen" to face the dangers of climate change 
(reftel).  The head of local environment NGO IndyAct, Wael Hmaidan, 
said there has recently been increased focus on environmental issues 
in Lebanon, as highlighted by the establishment of a GOL steering 
committee to coordinate the issues of climate change and 
desertification.  IndyAct is leading a delegation of 43 people to 
the UN Climate Change Conference (COP15) in Copenhagen.  The 
delegation includes activists, experts and media and will push to 
improve and solidify the Arab regional position regarding climate 
change. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Lebanon will not play a strong role during COP15 
negotiations and lacks a detailed position on climate change, 
according to Hmaidan.  Currently, Lebanon's policy is based on 
IndyAct's position, and stronger environmental commitment will only 
come with political will at the level of the prime minister, he 
said.  Lebanon has a national interest in staying close to the 
position of small island nations and away from that of the G-77 and 
oil-exporting countries, he explained, so it can be helpful to the 
USG in moving the Arab position away from the interests of 
oil-exporting countries. 
 
SALAMEH: NEW GOVERNMENT AN 
OPPORTUNITY FOR REFORM 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The newly formed national unity government is a unique 
opportunity that Lebanon should exploit to reform its economy, 
Central Bank of Lebanon (CBL) Governor Riad Salameh said during a 
dinner hosted by economic associations December 7.  Lebanon was not 
affected by the international recession, Salameh said, and the 
slowdown in some sectors was compensated by remarkable growth in the 
tourism sector.  Growth expectations for 2009 increased from 4% to 
7%, and GDP is expected to reach $32.7 billion, he said.  Earlier 
this month, Salameh claimed that Lebanon would not be affected by 
the financial crisis hitting Dubai, although other economists 
doubted Lebanon's insulation given its open economy and strong links 
with the Gulf region. 
 
CENTRAL BANK TO ROLL OVER CDS 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Salameh indicated the CBL may issue certificates of deposit 
(CDs) for seven to ten years to contain liquidity in the banking 
sector.  CBL head of financial operations Dr. Youssef El Khalil told 
us the CBL is considering the possibility of rolling over about $2.3 
billion worth of 5-year Lebanese pound-denominated CDs that will 
mature next year.  (Note: The CBL issued these CDs following the 
assassination of PM Rafiq Hariri in February 2005 to discourage 
capital outflows and maintain currency stability.  End note.)  The 
CBL wishes to capitalize on increased interest in Lebanese financial 
paper from domestic and foreign investors to obtain lower interest 
rates. 
 
BANKING MOU WITH THE UAE 
------------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) Lebanon's Banking Control Commission (BCC) signed an MOU with 
the United Arab Emirates'(UAE) Securities and Commodities Authority 
(SCA) to promote cooperation and the exchange of information in the 
areas of financial legislation, licensing, supervision of 
institutions, and financial investigations.  Abdullah Al-Turaifi, 
SCA's chief executive officer noted the MOU institutionalized the 
already existing cooperation between the two countries and would 
lead to more activity in the future, including the adoption of 
stringent supervisory and monitoring measures to ensure financial 
stability.  The agreement will encourage Lebanese firms to list on 
the UAE stock markets and vice versa.

TRA ISSUES THREE 
NEW INTERNET LICENSES 
--------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) granted 
interim licenses to three local companies to operate their own 
networks to provide broadband data and internet services.  This 
decision raised to 24 the number of private licensed service 
providers with their own networks, of which seven have assigned 
frequencies, TRA Chairman Dr. Kamal Shehadi told us.  He noted that 
this represents a business opportunity for U.S. technology. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Shehadi explained that all the internet licenses are 
interim licenses, as TRA is waiting for the Telecommunications 
Minister to send the licensing arrangement to the State Council for 
review and approval.  Once the arrangement is approved, he said, TRA 
will issue long-term licenses.
