The Lebanese press has been giving top billing to the ongoing events 
in Iran.  A number of newspapers are even reporting on what is 
happening in Iran above the fold and on local Lebanese issues below 
the fold.  Editorialists, however, continue to focus on local issues 
- or try to analyze what is happening in Iran from a Lebanese point 
of view.

"Obama, Netanyahu, Khamenei: Where are the Arabs...?" an editorial 
by Suleiman Takieddine in Arab nationalist As-Safir (6/23): 
 
"The Iranian crisis started to lessen after Khamenei delivered his 
speech.  He clearly supported the legitimacy of President-elect 
Ahmadinejad and tried to contain the opposition by praising the role 
of its leaders.  ...When violence continued on the streets of 
Tehran...the Iranian security forces started to use violence against 
the demonstrators.  ...What is more important, however, is the 
Iranian accusations against the United States and the West.  ...The 
accusations were general in Khamenei's speech, then escalated in 
Ahmadinejad's statements and reached their peak during the press 
conference that was held by the Iranian Foreign Minister.  President 
Obama's position, however, was extremely calculated to the extent 
that Obama did not really find differences between Ahmadinejad and 
Mousavi.  As for Europe, it...supported the Iranian reform movement. 
 ...Obviously, the European position backfired against the 
opposition in Tehran and did not help the Iranians to reach a 
settlement.   ... The West should have understood that Ahmadinejad's 
victory was an indication of the fact that the real authority in 
Iran finds him successful in the cofrontation against the West and 
the Americans inparticular.  ...Removing Ahmadinejad from power at 
this point in time would have been interpreted as a sign of 
weakness..." 
 
"Iran, Arabs Are Involved in What is Going On," an editorial by Ali 
Hamade in moderate, anti-Syrian An-Nahar (6/23): 
 
"...The Basij(the Iranian Revolutionary Guard) may implement its 
threats of 'revolutionary response' against the demonstrators, and 
drown them in a sea of blood...but the crisis will continue.  There 
is no doubt that Iran has changed.  ...The aura of the Iranian 
regime has failed.  The aura of the Sayyed himself has failed. 
...We as Arabs should have a say in what is happening in Iran.  It 
is true that what is happening in Iran is the Iranian's business. 
...Free Arabs in Beirut and other cities, however, are in a way 
involved in what is going on..."
