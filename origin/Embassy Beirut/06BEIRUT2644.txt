SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  PM Siniora described to Congressman Issa the serious 
damage the present conflict has inflicted on his country, as 
well as his hope that the American people would continue to 
support the people of Lebanon.  Congressman Issa praised PM 
Siniora's leadership and courage during this difficult 
period, and urged the Prime Minister to be steadfast so that 
Lebanon would emerge from the conflict with its sovereignty 
and unity intact.  PM Siniora said that following 30 years of 
Syrian domination, the Lebanese people were not about to give 
up their hard-earned freedom, but he urgently asked the U.S. 
and the other members of the international community to 
support Lebanon generously in its time of greatest need.  PM 
Siniora specifically asked the U.S. to provide assistance 
with reconstruction, particularly in the areas of 
infrastructure and housing.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  Congressman Darrel Issa and the Ambassador met with Prime 
Minister Fouad Siniora at the Grand Serail in Beirut on 
August 10.  Senior Siniora advisor Rola Nouraddine also 
attended the meeting, as did Congressional staffer James 
Lewis and poloff (notetaker). 
 
PM SINIORA'S OBSERVATIONS 
------------------------- 
 
¶3.  PM Siniora stated that most Lebanese are astounded and 
unable to understand the rationale for the damage that has 
been inflicted on their country by IDF forces over the past 
four weeks.  Siniora, as he has numerous times in the past 
weeks, appealed for an immediate cessation of hostilities and 
an agreement that would finally, after decades of instability 
and violence, bring security to the border between Lebanon 
and Israel. 
 
¶4.  Siniora emphasized that his seven-point plan, endorsed by 
his Council of Ministers, had the backing of almost every 
element of Lebanon's citizenry, and that if the UN Security 
Council could adopt its principles, both Lebanon and Israel 
would achieve what they had long sought -- a stable border 
manned by their respective sovereign forces.  The Prime 
Minister pointed out that Lebanon's approach to the proposed 
UN agreement incorporated the strengths of Lebanon's 1949 
Armistice Agreement, and as such, would be broadly accepted 
by the Lebanese people. 
 
¶5.  PM Siniora acknowledged that if a UNSC resolution could 
be adopted, it would only be the first step in a process that 
would require steady nerves and the courage to face issues 
that have long plagued Lebanon's unity and now its fledgling 
democracy.  The Prime Minister said that the first few weeks 
after the cessation of hostilities would be critical, not 
only in terms of controlling military action, but in terms of 
humanitarian relief and initiating and funding a 
comprehensive reconstruction effort. 
 
CONGRESSMAN ISSA RESPONDS 
------------------------- 
 
¶6.  In his comments to the Prime Minister, and later to a 
gathering of national and international press, Congressman 
Issa said the primary purpose of his visit was to demonstrate 
the American people's solidarity with the people of Lebanon 
during a time of great stress and danger.  Congressman Issa 
applauded the courage of the Siniora Government and the 
Lebanese people and stated his conviction they would recover 
from the destruction of a war they did not start, and 
continue with the challenging work of building the Arab 
world's most dynamic democracy. 
 
¶7.  Congressman Issa also said he would bring the story of 
Lebanon and its people back to his colleagues in the U.S. 
Congress.  The Congressman stated he was confident that 
Congress would respond generously through the various 
instruments of the U.S. foreign aid program and that he would 
closely monitor and support this effort until Lebanon fully 
recovered.  He completed his address with the observation 
that Lebanon had no shortage of leaders, no shortage of 
unity, and would suffer no shortage of support from America. 
 
¶8.  This cable was cleared by Congressman Issa.
