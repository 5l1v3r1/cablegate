"Berman to Visit Damascus to Reinforce Lifting the Ban, but He is 
carrying a Strong Message," an edtitorial by Nicolas Nassif in 
pro-opposition Al-Akhbar (2/17): 
 
"Lebanese visitors returned from Washington with information related 
to the American position on Syria and Lebanon.  On Syria, the 
Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Howard 
Berman, will travel to Damascus soon on a visit that will increase 
confirmation that the American political ban on Syria and Assad's 
Regime has been lifted.  The person who will be coordinating this 
visit is his colleague Senator Kerry.  Berman's visit is very 
important because he is the Godfather of the Syria Accountability 
Act that was issued in 2003.  ...Berman is carrying a very strong 
message to Damascus to urge it to cooperate seriously with 
Washington so that Washington will not have to re-use President 
Bush's policy towards Assad.  ...In this regard, sources noted that 
reports by Ambassador Sison to the State Department included fears 
that were expressed by March 14 over this new U.S. policy toward 
Syria and the possibility of its negative impact on Lebanon and its 
current majority.  ...Some sources believe that Hazem Ash-Shahabi, 
who is the son of former General in the Syrian Army Hikmat 
Ash-Shahabi, is actually behind Berman's visit to Damascus, because 
he is a well-known personality in California.  As for Lebanon, it is 
believed that the State Department staff on Near East Affairs has 
not been completed yet.  So far, no one has been appointed to 
replace Assistant Secretary Welch, although it is believed that 
former Ambassador to Lebanon Jeffrey Feltman is one of the most 
outstanding candidates for this post.  ...Furthermore, it is 
believed that David Hale, who was appointed as Feltman's assistant 
has been withdrawn from this position and was appointed as a special 
assistant to special Middle East envoy George Mitchell.  This means 
that Hale's next mission in the region will not have to do with 
Lebanon, but with the peace process..."
