¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche and report to MFA 
Americas Desk Officer Reina Charbel on October 26.  Charbel 
advised that the report would be shared with relevant GOL 
offices and said that the GOL remains committed to the 
principles of religious freedom and tolerance. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Reaction in Lebanon to the International Religious 
Freedom Report was mild, with limited media coverage.  The 
most comprehensive review was by news portal NowLebanon,

We have received no negative reaction from either official or 
private interlocutors.
