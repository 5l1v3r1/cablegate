Atmospherics:

The Lebanese press noted that the Future Movement, led by MP Saad 
Hariri, succeeded in making security in Beirut the priority and not 
the process of forming a new government; the security section of the 
Doha Agreement is taking precedence over the political section. The 
press also noted that the opposition accused the majority of 
"blowing the issue of security in Beirut out of proportion."

"Suleiman's Program to Save Lebanon: A Lebanon Liberated from Arms 
and Hegemony: The Truth About Syria's and Hizballah's Relations with 
the 'Respected President', an editorial by Abdel Al-Karim Abou 
Al-Nasr in moderate, anti-Syrian An-Nahar (6/6): 
 
"...It is true that Suleiman describes his relationship with Syria 
and its President...as excellent. Suleiman, however, is not a 
pro-Syrian President, and was never among the group of senior Army 
officers who have total and blind allegiance to Syria. A prominent 
European diplomat disclosed that Suleiman was not really Syria's 
choice for a Lebanese President because he never presented any prior 
commitments to the Syrian Regime. ...On the contrary, Syrian 
officials resented several positions he took since PM Hariri was 
assassinated, ...particularly the fact that he did not stop the 
March 14 demonstration which exploded in the Syrians' face. 
...Suleiman does not only aim at managing the Lebanese crisis, but 
also wants to work on ending it. He wants to deal with Hizballah's 
weapons..., supervise the operation of correcting relations with 
Syria; ...work on the economic situation; and ...participate with 
the government and the Parliament in giving governmental 
institutions the credibility and consideration they deserve..." 
 
"Election Lies," an editorial by Sateh Noureddine in Arab 
nationalist As-Safir (6/6): 
 
"We assume that Obama's speech before AIPAC...has removed a lot of 
dreams and illusions about this rising American star... This 
Zionist speech, which is one of Obama's strongest speeches, has 
surprised many...who thought that Obama will save them from the 
worst and most dangerous U.S. Administrations for Arabs and Moslems. 
...This yearning for revenge from the Bush Administration and its 
possible successor McCain...has stopped Arabs from looking closely 
at Obama's identity, his speeches, and his thinking. ...In his 
speech before AIPAC...Obama looked like any politician who is in the 
middle of a campaign, and who resorts to lies and tricks. The 
language he used did not reveal his opportunist character...but 
rather disclosed his decision to move to another stage in his battle 
-- which is to focus on attracting American Jewish votes. ...This 
presidential candidate will work soon according to the beat of the 
American political institution, and will forget about what he said 
about withdrawal from Iraq, and even what he said about Jerusalem as 
a united capital for Israel..."
