REGULATOR SAYS LEBANESE BANKING SECTOR STRONG 
DESPITE INTERNATIONAL CRISIS 
--------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) A senior source at the Banking Control Commission (BCC) -- 
an independent commission overseeing bank operations -- told us 
October 15 that banks operating in Lebanon have not been adversely 
affected by the international financial crisis.  The source refuted 
information that appeared in pro-opposition Al Akhbar on October 15 
that insinuated three banks (Audi Bank, Intercontinental Bank, and 
the Lebanese-Canadian Bank) may have sustained losses.  The source 
stressed that the BCC is closely monitoring on-site and off-site all 
banks operating in Lebanon, and indicated there is no sign of losses 
in these three banks or any other bank operating in Lebanon. 
 
BOEING INTERESTED IN 
LEBANON'S AVIATION MARKET 
------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Boeing International Sales and Regional Directors, Edward 
Schacle and Anthony Arvish, met with Ambassador October 14 for an 
update on Boeing's interest in selling B787 to national aviation 
carrier Middle East Airlines (MEA), as well as to some private 
charter companies operating out of Beirut International Airport. 
Schacle asked the Ambassador to make a pitch for Boeing with MEA 
Chairman Mohammad El-Hout and Board members, and noted that he will 
meet El Hout next week in Tunis during the Arab Air Carrier 
Organization annual meeting, which brings together Arab aviation 
companies and partners including Boeing, Airbus, and Bombardier. 
 
NEXT WTO WORKING PARTY MEETING EXPECTED BY DECEMBER, 
POST-ACCESSION ASSISTANCE WILL BE NEEDED 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) On October 6, Advisor to Minister of Economy and Trade and 
POC on WTO issues Lama Oueijan expressed confidence in Lebanon's 
accession to the WTO in the near future, expecting the next Working 
Party meeting to take place by the end of November- early December. 
Oueijan noted that there were still bilateral demands from the U.S. 
for lower tariffs, and said that the EU had expressed its 
willingness to move forward on accession, and she hoped to hear the 
same from the U.S. 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to Oueijan, the next challenge that Lebanon will 
face is not in terms of preparing for accession (the ministry is 
still working on necessary accession documents and public 
awareness), but post-accession regarding training ministries in 
dealing with notifications on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards 
(SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), as well as linking the 
inquiry points located at the various ministries.  Oueijan also 
noted that during the past three years, the EU has allocated Euro 75 
million for WTO and related technical assistance, and has already 
assisted Lebanon with drafting the Competition Law, establishing SPS 
inquiry points, and other related WTO-related assistance at various 
ministries, and not only at the Ministry of Economy and Trade. 
 
NO CONCRETE MEASURES FOLLOWING 
PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO SAUDI ARABIA 
-------------------- 
 
 
BEIRUT 00001496  002 OF 003 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Director General of Economic Affairs at the Presidential 
Palace Dr. Elie Assaf told us on October 14 that the visit of 
President Sleiman to Saudi Arabia "reinforced" bilateral relations 
and reasserted Saudi Arabia's "total support to Lebanon on the 
political, economic, and financial fronts."  There were no concrete 
measures announced, and no update on the status of the February 2008 
Saudi pledge to deposit an additional one billion dollars with the 
Central Bank of Lebanon, he said.  Assaf described as "excellent" 
the meeting President Sleiman had at the Chamber of Commerce, 
encouraging Lebanese and Saudi investors to resume investments in 
Lebanon. 
 
EDL FAILS TO GET LOWER ELECTRICITY 
PRICE FROM EGYPT 
------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ibrahim Menassah, senior advisor to Minister of Energy and 
Water (MEW) Alain Tabourian, told us October 16 that Chairman of 
national power utility, Electricite du Liban (EDL), Kamal Hayek, 
failed to reach an agreement with the Egyptian national power 
company to provide electricity to Lebanon.  Hayek was told that 
reducing the price of electricity sold to Lebanon would require "a 
political decision."  (Note: Egypt previously offered to sell 
Lebanon 150 megawatts of surplus electricity at a price indexed to 
the cost of heavy fuel, which both Hayek and Tabourian have told us 
they will not accept.  End note.) 
 
¶7. (SBU) Menassah added that Tabourian is considering "all options" 
to secure electricity for Lebanon at an "acceptable price."  One 
possibility, Menassah said, would be to contract with offshore ships 
to purchase electricity they produce.  (Note:  This could be a new 
opportunity for U.S. firms in this industry.  End note.)  Tabourian 
was receptive to the idea, if the price was right, and said it could 
provide a temporary solution until a new power plant is built. 
 
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FRUSTRATED WITH 
INCREASED COPYCAT REGISTRATIONS 
-------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) In a meeting with Econ Officers and LES on October 7, 
representatives of American Pharmaceutical Research-based companies 
in Lebanon reiterated their frustration with the Lebanese Ministry 
of Public Health and its failure to stop registering non-validated 
copies of innovative drugs that are still patented in the U.S. and 
the EU, and even accelerating the process of registration.  They 
believe that the best that can be done is to work towards a 
moratorium on future registration of copycats and made a pitch for 
Embassy assistance in this regard. According to the companies' 
figures, 28 copycats were registered in 2007, up from only nine in 
¶2006.  In addition, all those present expressed their surprise at 
the 2008 Special 301's report upgrade of Lebanon to Watch List from 
Priority Watch List, given Lebanon's lack of progress and continued 
violation of intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical 
sector. 
 
TELECOM MINISTER REITERATES SUPPORT 
FOR LIBAN TELECOM, CONTINUES REFORM 
-------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Minister of Telecommunications (MOT) Gebran Bassil visited 
Ogero, the entity in charge of fixed lines and maintenance, on 
October 14, according to press reports.  He reiterated his support 
for the creation of Liban Telecom, the new entity resulting from the 
merger of Ogero and the two directorates within the Ministry, which 
will hold the fixed lines and a third cellular license.  (Note: 
Ogero's Director General Abdel Munin Youssef, a protege of PM 
Siniora, has been delaying the setting up of Liban Telecom, as he 
wants to chair this new entity.  End note.)  Bassil asked for 
"regular reports" about Ogero's activities. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Meanwhile, a senior source at the Ministry told us October 
17 that Bassil has taken measures to stop illegal traffic and 
interference in the network.  To date, ten companies have seen their 
operations suspended because of illegal traffic.  Bassil has also 
warned importers and users of illegal equipment, such as repeaters, 
jammers, SNG (used in pirated broadcasts), and VSATS 
(telecommunications via satellite) that they have until October 25 
to stop using such equipment.  This type of equipment affects 
coverage and service on the network and causes MOT revenue loss.

EU HOLDS INTER-LEBANESE 
FORUM ON SMES 
-------------------- 
 
¶11. (U) Under the initiative of the European Commission Delegation 
to Lebanon, representatives of Lebanese political blocs in 
parliament and major political parties, professional associations, 
and independent experts met October 15-16 in Beirut to reach a 
common vision on appropriate actions to develop and strengthen small 
and medium enterprises, bolster entrepreneurship spirit and 
creativity, and encourage fair competition.  This forum builds on 
the success of two previous rounds, one that discussed a broad 
socio-economic vision for Lebanon (May 2007) and the other on 
appropriate social policies for Lebanon (April 2008).  These forums 
are a platform for legislators, major political parties, and private 
sector representatives to openly address socio-economic concerns, 
reaching an agreement on actions that need to be implemented. 
 
LEBANON FALLS IN EUROMONEY 
COUNTRY RISK SURVEY 
-------------------- 
 
¶12. (U) In its latest survey of country risk, Euromoney magazine 
ranked Lebanon 134 out of 186 countries worldwide and 15 out of 20 
MENA countries, compared to 127 worldwide and 16 in the MENA region 
in the March 2008 survey.  The survey evaluates individual country 
risk by assigning a weighting to nine categories that cover 
political risk, economic performance, debt indicators, debt in 
default or rescheduled debt, credit ratings, access to bank finance, 
access to short-term finance, access to capital markets, and 
discount on forfeiting.  According to the survey, when adjusted for 
corruption, Lebanon's rank declines to 138.  Lebanon's scores for 
individual categories were mixed, but showed little improvement in 
overall risk profile. 
 
ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT EXPECTS 
FISCAL DEFICIT OF 9.7 PERCENT OF GDP IN 2008 
-------------------- 
 
¶13. (U) According to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the 
GOL's fiscal deficit is expected to reach 9.7 percent of GDP in 
2008, slightly decreasing to 7.4 percent of GDP in 2009.  The EIU 
identified the upcoming parliamentary elections, the raise in public 
sector wages, and maintaining energy subsidies as the main 
constraints to reducing government spending.  The EIU does not 
believe that mobile and electricity privatization will take place 
before the end of 2009, especially since disagreements within the 
GOL on this issue persist.
