Polchief discussed the May 3 International Compact with Iraq 
meeting with Oussama Khacchab, Americas and Multilateral 
Affairs officer at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  After 
consulting with his colleagues, Khacchab reported that the 
prevailing view at the MFA is that Lebanon, as a small 
country going through its own political and economic crisis, 
has little to offer Iraq and would likely not send a 
delegation from Beirut to either the May 3 or May 4 meeting 
in Sharm el-Sheikh.  Polchief told Khacchab that while 
material support may not be possible, Lebanon can still make 
a gesture demonstrating political support for Iraq by sending 
as high-level a representative as feasible to the May 3 
meeting.  Khacchab noted that since the MFA is without its 
minister, who resigned in November along with the other Shia 
ministers in Lebanon's cabinet, ministerial-level 
representation at the meeting is extremely unlikely.  He 
promised, however, to take up the matter with the MFA's 
Director-General Ambassador Dimachkie, who is in Cairo now 
and will return at the end of the week.  We will see Khacchab 
again April 24 and may have an update to report.
