SUBJECT: LEBANESE RESPONSE TO 2005 SUA PROTOCOLS DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 59097 
 
 On April 26, we delivered reftel demarche urging the 
signature and ratification of the two new protocols to the UN 
Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the 
Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA) and its related protocol 
on Fixed Platforms to Ghady El-Khoury, Head of the Americas 
Desk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  El-Khoury promised 
to bring the issue of the 2005 SUA Protocols to the attention 
of Foreign Minister Fawzi Salloukh.  El-Khoury told econoff 
that Lebanon, unfortunately, has a "lengthy process" for the 
ratification and signing of protocols.  He said the bulk of 
work in the ratification process is done in committees.  He 
speculated that the Foreign Relations Committee, the Public 
Works Committee, and the Law and Administration Committee 
would all need to approve the 2005 SUA Protocols before GOL 
signature and ratification.
