¶1. (SBU) Post found no public or media reports about TIP or 
SEA involving UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) personnel 
in Lebanon. Similarly, UNIFIL officials told us that there 
were no cases or reports of TIP or SEA involving UNIFIL 
personnel in 2008.  UNIFIL staff officers continue to receive 
training in international humanitarian law, provided by the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to help 
prevent SEA and TIP.  For UNIFIL contingents, UNIFIL has 
scheduled the ICRC to conduct similar humanitarian law 
training for all contingents within the first two weeks of 
their arrival in the mission area. 
 
¶3. (SBU) A new initiative started in 2009, undertaken by the 
UNIFIL Conduct and Discipline Team, will include training of 
all contingents about UN standards of conduct.  This training 
will cover combating sexual harassment exploitation and 
abuse.  UNIFIL aims to have this training given to all 
contingents within one month of their arrival to the mission. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post contacted the Foundation for Human and 
Humanitarian Rights in Lebanon. The head of the Education 
Committee, Jean Pierre Katrib, told PolOff he had no 
derogatory information concerning UNIFIL and TIP/SEA. 
 
¶4. (U) The Lebanese public is generally supportive of the 
UNIFIL mission in Lebanon and its personnel. 
 
¶5. (U) UNIFIL's mandate currently extends until August 31, 
¶2009.
