SUBJECT:  Lebanon:  Media Coverage -- USAID Projects in the South 
 
 
¶1.  Summary:  Under the title "Forbidden Assistance," a Lebanese 
magazine "Southern Issues" (Shu'un Jannubiah) carried a ten-page 
report on the United States Agency for International Development 
(USAID)/Lebanon's assistance to southern Lebanon, the area where 
Hizballah, a designated terrorist organization, holds sway.  The 
report included an interview with USAID/Lebanon director, Raouf 
Youssef, in addition to a description of USAID projects being 
implemented by various nongovernmental organization (NGO) partners. 
The articles were accompanied by color photographs and a map showing 
project locations.  The cover photograph was taken in the USAID 
director's office and showed the U.S. and Lebanese flags flanking 
the USAID emblem. End Summary. 
 
Description of the Magazine 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2.  The title for this issue, "Forbidden Assistance," is directed at 
Hizballah, which has consistently forbidden its own Shi'a Muslim 
community members to accept assistance from U.S. sources. 
 
¶3.  "Southern Issues" was established in January 2002 by USAID; 
AMIDEAST was the implementing partner.  At the time, AMIDEAST was 
focusing on "Transparency and Accountability," which mirrored the 
magazine's purpose to focus on southern Lebanese issues objectively 
and transparently.  Following USAID/AMIDEAST funding and assistance, 
the magazine received a grant from the National Democratic Institute 
(NDI), which is a NGO working to strengthen and expand democracy 
worldwide.  When the NDI grant ended, the magazine received funding 
from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which is also a NGO 
working to strengthen democratic institutions around the world.  The 
magazine receives an annual grant from NED which covers about 60 
percent of its expenses. 
 
¶4.  The "Southern Issues" magazine has approximately 700 
subscribers, sells between 300 to 400 issues, and distributes about 
500 issues for free per month; it has a total monthly circulation of 
¶1500.  Its thirty-five staff members receive symbolic wages, i.e., 
they are essentially volunteers.  The magazine headquarters were 
originally in Beirut's southern suburb and were totally destroyed in 
the July 2006 war.  The new headquarters are near the "Rafiq Hariri 
International Airport" in Beirut. The two founders of the magazine, 
Ali Al-Amin and Kassem Kassir, are considered moderate Shi'a, who 
are credible, and are known for their open-mindedness and objective 
criticism of Hizballah. 
 
Articles on USAID Assistance 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4.  The issue started by noting that USAID assistance is from the 
American to the Lebanese people.  The many implementing NGOs and the 
 scope of the projects were discussed.  The issue emphasized that 
USAID's assistance is unconditional and immediate with no political 
bias.  Two hundred and twenty southern Lebanese municipalities have 
benefited so far from USAID assistance; and, approximately forty 
percent of USAID's assistance focuses on southern Lebanon.  One 
article noted that some southerners did not benefit from USAID 
assistance as they refused it for political reasons.  The issue 
highlighted various projects and described them, for example, the 
restoration of partially destroyed homes and Tyre's historic fort, 
assistance to fishermen, and economic growth projects assisting the 
victims and the families of victims of landmines. 
 
¶5.  Comment: This issue of "Southern Affairs" is one of the many 
success stories Public Diplomacy (PD) Beirut is assisting in 
generating through its efforts to promote U.S. activities throughout 
Lebanon.  USAID projects are a concrete manifestation of the U.S. 
Government's support to Lebanon.  End Comment.
