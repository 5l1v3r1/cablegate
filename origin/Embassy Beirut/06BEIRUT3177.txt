STIRS DISCORD 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU/NF) The first-ever election for the Druze Doctrinal 
Council 
was conducted on September 24.  The election produced an 
important 
victory for Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, both in cementing his 
control over the Council and in putting his followers in 
charge of 
the $800 million Druze Endowment, and a loss for Syria and its 
allies among the Druze.  The election was also a victory for 
March 
14 forces, who had passed the law calling for Council 
elections, 
over President Lahoud's objection, in order to break the lock 
that 
Syrian-allied Druze had held on the Council for many years. 
The new 
Council will form a Board which will appoint the new Shaykh 
al-Aql, 
the paramount Druze religious leader.  In reaction to Sunday's 
election, pro-Syrian Druze leader Arsalan appointed his own 
Shaykh 
al-Aql, whom President Lahoud promptly received at the 
presidential 
palace.  Tensions are high among the Druze, but for the 
moment the 
two sides of the dispute seem determined to pursue a solution 
in the 
courts.  End Summary. 
 
UNPRECEDENTED ELECTIONS 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The March 8/March 14 divide in Lebanon's political 
line-up 
played itself out in the Druze community last weekend when 
the Druze 
Electoral College elected board members to the Druze Doctrinal 
Council for the first time in its history.  The members, who 
had in 
the past been appointed by Druze clergy, will elect the next 
"Shaykh 
al Aql," the paramount Druze religious leader.  The election, 
which 
took place under a law passed by March 14 MPs along with the 
tacit 
consent of Speaker Nabih Berri, represents a political 
victory for 
Walid Jumblatt.  It was also a defeat for President Lahoud, 
who had 
declined to approve the election law when it was first 
presented in 
December 2005; the law was passed by a super-majority in June 
¶2006. 
At stake is control of the lucrative Druze Endowment, whose 
USD 800 
million in assets are managed by the Druze Doctrinal Council. 
 
REINFORCES JUMBLATT BUT DIVIDES DRUZE COMMUNITY 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Should Jumblatt's allies on the Council secure 
control of 
the Endowment, Jumblatt's position as Druze political leader 
may be 
unassailable for the foreseeable future.  However, the 
controversy 
over control of the Council and the Endowment has the 
potential to 
divide the Druze community.  Pro-Syrian political leader Talal 
Arsalan reacted to the Council election by appointing his own 
Shaykh 
al-Aql, Nasr al-Deen Ghareeb.  President Lahoud on Tuesday 
exploited 
this division by inviting Ghareeb to Baabda Palace. 
 
¶4. (SBU/NF) In a September 26 telephone conversation with Pol 
 
BEIRUT 00003177  002 OF 002 
 
 
staff, 
Arsalan said that the political divisions within the Druze 
community 
are worsening and could "get out of control" when the new 
Council 
starts taking control over the Endowment.  He said "the 
Endowment is 
estimated at approximately $800 million and with some 
development 
projects it could reach well above $1 billion."  Taking a 
firm stand 
against Jumblatt, Arsalan added "Jumblatt wants to control the 
Endowment for his own political gains and we shall not allow 
this to 
happen because it is against the Druze faith and traditions." 
 
JUMBLATT ALLIES ACCUSE SYRIA OF INTERFERENCE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU/NF) Jumblatt-allied MPs Wael Abu and Akram Shuhayyeb 
told us 
September 26 that Arsalan's nomination of Shaykh Ghareeb is 
illegal 
and reflects a Syrian push to cause division within the Druze 
community.  The Council, once it elects a new Shaykh al-Aql, 
will 
take legal measures against Ghareeb; he will most likely face 
charges of usurping power.  For the time being, both sides of 
the 
dispute seemed determined to resolve the issue in the courts.
