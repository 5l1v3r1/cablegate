SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post delivered reftel demarches June 12 to Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs Directorate of International Organizations 
Walid Haidar.  Haidar noted that Lebanon will attend the 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) preparatory 
meeting June 28-30 in Egypt.  Lebanese representatives have 
not been selected, but Haidar expected a ministerial-level 
delegation.  He said ratification of Lebanon's IRENA 
membership required parliamentary approval; since the 
parliament is in a transitional stage following June 7 
elections, Haidar assessed ratification would be postponed 
until the new parliament becomes operational, sometime after 
June 21. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Lebanon supports the UAE as a headquarters for IRENA 
and has no position so far on the body's Director General, 
Haidar told us.  On the mission, focus, and purpose of IRENA, 
he said Lebanon considers IRENA's mission "comprehensive" and 
will support the organization's stated mission, including 
capacity building and technical assistance.
