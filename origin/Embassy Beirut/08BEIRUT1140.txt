TELECOM MINISTER: ALL LEBANESE AGREE ON PRIVATIZATION, 
MOBILE COVERAGE TO BE IMPROVED 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. (U) In a press conference on July 30, Telecom Minister Gebran 
Bassil stated telecom privatization is something that all Lebanese 
agree upon, and that close examination of the issue will take place 
as soon as the Cabinet's policy statement is ratified by parliament. 
 Bassil noted that $67,000 have been allocated to improve mobile 
phone coverage in the north and Biq'a region along the 
Lebanese-Syrian border, while similar steps will be taken to improve 
coverage in the south.  Both are low-income areas.  Bassil announced 
that the Higher Lebanese-Syrian Council will be meeting soon to 
discuss Syrian interference in Lebanese mobile networks and the weak 
Lebanese coverage. 
 
CONUSUMER PRICE INDEX UP BY 
6.2 PERCENT IN FIRST HALF OF 2008 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The Central Administration of Statistics (CAS) Consumer Price 
Index indicated that inflation rose by nearly 6.2 percent during the 
first half of 2008.  This was mostly attributed to increases in the 
prices of transportation (17.7 percent), water, electricity, and 
fuels (14.6 percent), restaurant and hotels (14.3 percent), food and 
non-alcoholic beverages (7.5 percent), health care (5.1 percent), 
and housing (4.8 percent). 
 
FISCAL DEFICIT AT 27.7 PERCENT OF TOTAL 
EXPENDITURES IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) According to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the GOL's fiscal 
deficit reached 27.7 percent of total expenditures in the first half 
of 2008, compared to 29.1 percent in the same period of 2007.  The 
MOF considers this an improvement when comparing the ratio of the 
overall fiscal balance to total expenditures: public revenues 
increased by 15.6 percent during the first half of 2008, compared to 
the same period in 2007.  On the other hand, expenditures increased 
by 13.3 percent (including budgetary and treasury spending). 
Treasury expenditures contributed the most to the increase in total 
spending, which rose by 52.2 percent, due to increased transfers to 
the national utility company EDL and the diesel oil subsidy. 
 
BANKS WILL FINANCE 2008 GOL DEFICIT, 
DEPOSITS ON THE RISE 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Banking sources have told us that Lebanese banks will 
finance the GOL deficit in 2008, projected at around $2.5 billion, 
or ten percent of GDP.  This year more than ever, banks are willing 
to subscribe in T-bills and Eurobonds because of their high 
liquidity, as well as the drop in international interest rates 
(LIBOR dropped by three percent).  Banks don't want their profitable 
position to drop; they have increased their exposure to private 
sector lending and sovereign debt. 
 
¶5. (SBU) At the same time, banks continue to see an increase in 
deposits because of confidence in the banking sector. Bank deposits 
rose by $6.6 billion in 2007, and are projected to increase by $8-9 
billion in 2008.  Thus, with bank profits and balance sheets up, 
banks are able to lend more to the private and public sectors.

ARAB INVESTMENTS IN LEBANON UP BY 47.5 PERCENT 
IN 2007 DESPITE POLITICAL STALEMATE 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) The Arab Investment and Export Credit Guarantee Corporation's 
annual report "Investment Climate in the Arab Countries" indicated 
that Arab investments in Lebanon rose by 47.5 percent in 2007, 
totaling $3.34 billion.  Lebanon's share of aggregate inter-Arab 
investments also reached a record high of 23.8 percent in 2007, 
compared to a share of 13.7 percent in 2006.  Lebanon was the second 
largest recipient of Arab capital in nominal terms among eight Arab 
countries covered in the report, up from fourth in 2006, which is 
considered significant in the context of the recent political 
stalemate in the country.  The real estate sector received 81.2 
percent of all Arab investments.  While 69.9 percent of all Arab 
investments originated from Saudi Arabia, followed by Kuwait (21 
percent), UAE (3.7 percent), and Jordan (3.3 percent). 
 
¶7. (U) Meanwhile, Lebanese investments in Arab countries totaled 
$465 million in 2007, a slight decrease from $498 million in 2006. 
Most Lebanese investments targeted Saudi Arabia (60 percent), 
followed by Egypt (23.1 percent), Jordan (8.9 percent), Libya (6.7 
percent), Yemen (1.2 percent), and Tunisia (0.04 percent). 
 
TOURISTS UP BY 14.9 PERCENT 
IN FIRST HALF OF 2008 
-------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) The number of tourists to Lebanon totaled 473,574 during the 
first half of 2008, up by 14.9 percent compared to the first half of 
¶2007.  Arab visitors accounted for 33.5 percent of the total, 
followed by Europe (28.2 percent), Asia (15.9 percent), the Americas 
(15.2 percent), Africa (3.7 percent), and Oceania (3.3 percent). 
Last month, former Tourism Minister Joe Sarkis expected the number 
of tourists in 2008 to reach between 1.3-1.6 million. 
 
CITIGROUP: LEBANESE ECONOMY REMAINS ROBUST, 
PUBLIC DEBT BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
-------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) In its first report on Lebanon following the Doha Conference, 
Citigroup indicated that the Lebanese economy has been surprisingly 
robust despite a series of political shocks since 2005.  The 
formation of a new cabinet was welcomed, although its short duration 
will not allow it to take important political and economic 
decisions.  Citigroup considered the high level of public debt as 
the biggest challenge facing Lebanon, while below-potential growth 
in recent years and a modest privatization record have not been 
supportive of a debt reduction strategy.  However, it considered 
Lebanon's debt exposure as less of a concern given a base of 
committed investors, robust deposit growth in the banking sector, 
and foreign interest in the real estate sector.  According to 
Citigroup, the sale of the mobile phone licenses could bring more 
than $7 billion, allowing the GOL to retire more than half of its 
market debt in one shot. 
 
BEIRUT RANKS 80 OUT OF 143 MOST 
EXPENSIVE CITIES WORLDWIDE 
-------------------- 
 
¶10. (U) According to Mercer Human Resource Consulting annual cost of 
living survey, Beirut ranked 80 out of 143 most expensive cities in 
the world in 2008, down from 63 in 2007.  Beirut also ranked 7 out 
of 15 most expensive MENA cities in 2008, as compared to 5 in 2007. 
The survey noted that since Beirut is compared with New York City, 
in which the cost of living has increased greatly relative to 
Beirut, the score for Beirut declined; also cities using the Euro 
have jumped significantly in the rankings because of the 
strengthening of the Euro against the Dollar.  The survey measures 
the comparative cost of over 200 items in each location, with New 
York City as a benchmark.
