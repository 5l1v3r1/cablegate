SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 23, per reftel instructions, Poloff 
delivered the 2009 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report to the 
Surete Generale's (Immigration) Director of the 
Nationalities, Passports, and Foreigners Department General 
Siham Harake.  We informed Harake that Lebanon had been 
downgraded to a Tier 2 Watch List country and explained the 
implications of this, including the possible sanctions and 
waivers involved if a country moves into Tier 3 status. 
Poloff described steps the GOL must take to improve its 
ranking, such as investigate and prosecute trafficking 
offenses under existing law, convict and punish trafficking 
offenders, develop and institute formal procedures to 
identify victims of trafficking among vulnerable populations, 
consider measures to lessen the abuse of the artist work 
permit as a conduit for sex trafficking and enforce Lebanese 
law prohibiting the confiscation of passports of foreign 
maids. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Regarding the issue of confiscating foreign maids' 
passports, Harake said it was within her power to end this 
practice.  She said she would ask for her supervisor's 
opinion, but said it was a relatively easy problem to 
correct.  Movement on other recommendations would require 
further interagency talks with the Ministry of Justice and 
possible technical assistance from the United State on how to 
develop formal procedures for identifying TIP victims. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Harake acknowledged that Lebanon needs to do more to 
solve its TIP problem.  She said that the withdrawal of Shia 
Ministers from the cabinet in 2006, the July 2006 war with 
Israel, and the 18-month shutdown of Lebanon's parliament 
2006-08 all led to a lack of progress regarding Lebanon's TIP 
problems.  Harake added that she personally tried everything 
she could to get some of the issue solved, but was 
unsuccessful 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post submitted a request for technical assistance 
from G/TIP on behalf of the GOL to help develop formal 
procedures for identifying TIP victims and drafting anti-TIP 
legislation.  In addition, Post will organize a TIP 
roundtable discussion, composed of civil society leaders, GOL 
officials, and journalists to highlight and discuss problems 
and solutions to this problem.  The Public Affairs Office 
posted the report to the Embassy website.  We will follow up 
with the GOL on ending the practice of taking domestic 
workers' passports and other TIP matters.  End Comment.
