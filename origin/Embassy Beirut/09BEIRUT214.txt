SUBJECT:  Lebanon: Media Reaction - February 24, 2009 
 
Atmospherics: 
------------- 
 
The Lebanese media highlighted visits by the head of the 
International Commission investigating former PM Hariri's 
assassination, Daniel Bellemare, to President Suleiman, Speaker 
Berri, and Prime Minister Siniora to bid them farewell before he 
left for The Hague.  The press also noted that there were no 
developments in the on-going conflict between the Speaker and the 
Prime Minister over the budget. 
 
An editorialist in Arab nationalist As-Safir newspaper reported 
speculations that Senator Kerry "digested a lesson" about Lebanon 
that was reportedly given to him by Acting A/S Feltman.  The 
editorialist sharply criticized Senator Kerry's statements about the 
parliamentary elections and his style which "reminded the Lebanese 
of Feltman's style," noting that "talking in this manner three 
months before the elections is not wise...and may eventually 
backfire."  He also noted that, Feltman's support for the Cedar 
Revolution did nothing "except deepen divisions and provocations...

"Feltman's Logic," an editorial by George Alam in Arab nationalist 
As-Safir (2/24): 
 
"It is being said behind the scenes that, before he came to Lebanon, 
Senator Kerry...talked to Ambassador Feltman and digested a special 
lesson about Lebanon which he (Kerry) cleverly reported when he came 
to Beirut. ...The opposition is dealing with great care with the 
U.S. involvement in the elections on March 14's side, and says that 
this is not good for President Suleiman and his compromise role. 
...Senator Kerry reminded the Lebanese of Ambassador Feltman's style 
when he was in Beirut..., and boycotted the President (Lahoud). 
Kerry's style seemed to revive (Feltman's) style when he ignored the 
President's (Suleiman) status, and his effort to create compromise. 
...The opposition believes that this manner in dealing with Lebanon 
is a blatant strike against civil peace. ...What reduces the impact 
of this American involvement, however, is the fact that the U.S. 
Administration did not publicly adopt these (Kerry's) statements. 
....Talking in this manner three months before the elections is not 
wise...and may eventually backfire.  In any case, U.S. support was 
never beneficial, but many times was closer to propaganda.  What did 
this 'Feltmanian's' support for the Cedar Revolution do except 
deepen divisions and provocations which is a burden on the shoulders 
of all Lebanese without exception." 
 
"Rockets in the South and Moving Explosions Are Pushing Diplomats 
into Asking Questions," an editorial by Khalil Flayhan in moderate, 
anti-Syrian An-Nahar (2/24): 
 
"The security situation in Lebanon is back as a subject of concern 
for Arab and foreign Ambassadors in Lebanon...particularly the 
launching of the rockets against Israel.  ...Despite the amateurish 
set-up of the rockets, Ambassadors noted that those who launched the 
rockets were clever enough to target civilian places inside Israel. 
 ....Arab diplomatic sources in Beirut confirmed that there were no 
documented answers to the questions about the security situation in 
Lebanon.  They described...the security situation as 'fragile' and 
chaotic.  ...The only positive element is the fact that there has 
been no Hizballah operation against Israel through the 
Lebanese-Israeli border since the end of the July war in 2006..." 
 
"Kerry's Request for Syria to Interfere with Hizballah Raises 
Questions," an editorial by Rosana Bou-Monsef in moderate, 
anti-Syrian An-Nahar (2/24): 
 
"Senator Kerry's visit...satisfied the Lebanese...and the Europeans 
 
BEIRUT 00000214  002 OF 002 
 
 
because...of his confirmation that the new U.S. Administration is 
committed to Lebanon's sovereignty.  ...Sources noted in particular, 
however, Kerry's announcement that the U.S. wants Syria to help in 
disarming Hizballah...because they know that the U.S. will enter a 
maze over this issue with Syria...Some speculated that perhaps the 
U.S. thinks that Syria might help in disarming Hizballah in return 
for a greater Syrian influence in Lebanon.  ...Others, however, say 
that they have no fears and recall...that there are internationalresolutions now that deal with Hizballah's weapons.  ...They 
disclose that the U.N. is working on preparing a legal study about 
the possibility of taking statements by Syrian officials into 
consideration and use it as a legal confirmation of the Lebanese 
ownership of the Shebaa Farms.   ...But now, we have to take into 
consideration the French experience with Syria and their feeling 
that, as a first step, Syria is practicing blackmail by not 
nominating a Syrian Ambassador to Lebanon..."
