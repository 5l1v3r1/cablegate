SUBJECT: LEBANON:  CABINET REVOKES CONTROVERSIAL DECISIONS 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) On May 14, the Cabinet revoked its two contentious decisions 
on transferring the head of airport security after discovering 
Hizballah-installed monitoring cameras and declaring Hizballah's 
fiber optics network illegal.  The decisions, which sparked street 
violence between Hizballah fighters and pro-March 14 supporters 
since May 7, were rescinded after meetings with the Qatari-led Arab 
League (AL) delegation.  Meanwhile, political leaders agreed to meet 
in Doha on May 16 to hold a national dialogue focused on government 
formation and a new electoral law.  While Hizballah arms are not 
formally on the agenda, it appears they will be addressed.  End 
summary. 
 
ARIDI ANNOUNCES CABINET HAS 
REVOKED PREVIOUS DECISIONS 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Following a five-hour long cabinet meeting, the Siniora 
government rescinded its May 5 decisions to remove the head of 
airport security and to confront Hizballah's fiber optics network 
following the discovery of HIzballah-installed monitoring cameras at 
Beirut International Airport.  Reading the cabinet statement, 
Minister of Information Ghazi Aridi said, "In order to facilitate 
the negotiations of the Arab League Ministerial delegation and to 
preserve national unity and the security of citizens, the government 
decided to accept the Lebanese Armed Forces' (LAF) request to 
abolish these two cabinet decisions." 
 
HIZBALLAH CELEBRATES DECISION 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Celebratory shots by pro-opposition supporters were heard in 
various areas, notably in the predominantly Shia areas of the 
southern suburbs of Beirut.  Hizballah supporters went to the 
streets to celebrate the cabinet's announcement. 
 
ARAB LEAGUE FM'S MET WITH 
KEY POLITICAL LEADERS 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Meanwhile, the Arab League (AL) ministerial delegation, which 
arrived Beirut on May 14, met with Speaker Nabih Berri, Prime 
Minister Fouad Siniora, LAF Commander Michel Suleiman, former 
President Amine Gemayel, leader of the Free Patriotic Movement 
Michel Aoun, Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, Lebanese Forces leader 
Samir Geagea and Future Movement Party leader Saad Hariri. 
 
¶5. (U) The AL also met with Hizballah Deputy Secretary General 
Sheikh Naim Qassem on May 15.  In a press conference held after the 
meeting, Qassem stated that all pending issues can be solved through 
dialogue that will be sponsored by the AL and will address the 
national unity government and the electoral law.  As for the 
presidency, it has already been determined that General Sleiman will 
be president.  He added, "We want to reach a compromise whereby 
there is no winner and no loser."  Qassem noted, "We want to work 
hand in hand in order to build Lebanon; neither U.S. intervention 
nor external meddling is in the interest of Lebanon." 
 
FIRST MEETING IN DOHA ON MAY 16 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ghattas Khoury, advisor to MP Saad Hariri, told us the AL 
reached an agreement to start negotiations, and the dialogue will 
probably begin in Doha on May 16.  He expects a public announcement 
around 1530 local time on May 15.  The agreement was that the 
dialogue will focus on the two points:  electoral law and government 
formation.  Khoury added that the issue of Hizballah's weapons will 
be put on the agenda "in an acceptable way."  A resigned Khoury said 
but said it "was the best we can do" and "it will buy us time."  The 
expected attendees will be the leaders of the fourteen key political 
factions, although it is expected that Hizballah SYG Hassan 
Nasrallah will not personally attend.
