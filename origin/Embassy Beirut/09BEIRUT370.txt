GOVERNMENTS WHOSE BUDGETS ARE NOT TRANSPARENT 
 
REF: STATE 28885 
 
¶1. (SBU) It is post's assessment that Lebanon's budget easily meets 
the standards of transparency set under Section 7088(c)(1) of the 
Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs 
Appropriations Act, 2009. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The GOL makes all its budgets available online, including 
both revenues and expenditures.  Parliament often passes spending 
laws mandating expenditures that are not included in the budget, and 
some public institutions' spending is also not included. 
Nonetheless, the GOL publishes as much information as possible about 
additional spending, usually on the websites of the entities that 
spend it.  In addition, on March 16, Finance Minister Mohammad 
Chatah committed the GOL to a 2-year World Bank budget transparency 
program, meant to bring Lebanon fully in line with international 
standards.
