H1N1 DECLARED EPIDEMIC 
---------------------- 
 
¶1. (U) Minister of Public Health Mohammad Khalifeh announced 
November 25 that Lebanon had moved to the epidemic stage of H1N1, as 
test results showed that 80% of people with the flu were carrying 
the H1N1 strain.  However, he reiterated that the virus was not 
fatal, noting that most patients were being treated at home and that 
only two deaths thus far had been attributed to the virus.  The 
ministry will provide the anti-viral drug Tamiflu to all government 
hospitals to distribute to children for free, Khalifeh said. 
Although the Ministry of Public Health, in collaboration with the 
Ministry of Education, decided not to postpone the 2009-2010 school 
year for private and public schools because of the virus, several 
private schools have unilaterally closed for up to one week, given 
cases of swine flu. 
 
JUSTICE MINISTER BACKS 
MODERNIZING COMMERCIAL LAWS 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Minister of Justice Ibrahim Najjar called for the need to 
modernize commercial laws -- some of which date back to the 1920s -- 
and better implement legislation in general, during the opening of a 
one-day conference organized by the Arab Center for the Development 
of the Rule of Law and Integrity (ACRLI).  Najjar said new business 
laws needed to consider e-commerce and noted that the ministry 
already had considered 75 laws for reform and improvement. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Meanwhile, Minister of Economy and Trade Mohammad Safadi 
stressed the importance of modernizing laws as a means of 
encouraging investments and increasing productivity and exports, 
thereby raising job opportunities and per capita income.  Safadi 
noted that many new commercial and economic laws were previously 
drafted and are still pending parliamentary passage.  (Note:  New 
draft laws and amendments directly related to Lebanon's accession to 
the WTO are currently pending parliamentary ratification, some for 
more than two years.  End note.) 
 
HIGHER COUNCIL FOR 
CHILDHOOD LAUNCHES WEBSITE 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The Ministry of Social Affairs' Higher Council for Childhood 
(HCC) launched its new website, coinciding with the 20th anniversary 
of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The trilingual 
website, Atfalouna ('our kids') (http://www.atfalouna.gov.lb) 
features information for children, parents, and professionals, UN 
documentation, HCC publications, an e-library, and a list of 
child-related NGOs.  A study on the situation of children and women 
by the HCC in collaboration with UNICEF is expected to be placed on 
the site in early 2010. Some of the most important issues facing 
children in Lebanon include poverty, school dropouts, physical 
punishment and child labor, but detailed documentation and accurate 
statistics are not readily available. 
 
SECOND MOST ECONOMICALLY 
FREE COUNTRY IN REGION 
------------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) Lebanon ranked 2nd out of 15 countries in the Fraser 
Institute's annual 2009 Index of Economic Freedom in the Arab World, 
up from 5th in 2008.  Lebanon ranked first regionally in terms of 
government size (small relative to its economy) and access to 
available liquidity and stable currency, and second in terms of 
regulation of credit, labor, and business.  Lebanon lagged in the 
categories of freedom to trade internationally, legal structure, and 
security of property rights.
