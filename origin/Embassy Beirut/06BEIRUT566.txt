PALESTINIAN TERROR SUSPECT 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) On February 16, the Lebanese army arrested a 
Palestinian national, Mohammad Abed al-Shmandur (aka Abu al- 
Abed) at a checkpoint near the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian 
refugee camp.  He was suspected of transporting ammunition 
in the trunk of his car.  While his political affiliation is 
unclear, the press reported that Shmandur runs his own armed 
group.  Other reports indicated that he is a member of a 
radical Sunni group that operates inside the Ain al-Hilweh 
camp, "Jund al-Sham," which is a splinter of the outlawed 
Esbat al-Ansar group.  Shamndur was reportedly released on 
February 23, upon alleged political pressure from MP Bahia 
Hariri.  End Summary 
 
¶2.  (U) On February 17, rumors spread in the Ta'meer area 
that Shmandur died in custody as a result of torture.  Soon 
after, armed men took to the streets and burned tires and 
started firing in the air.  Army checkpoints around the camp 
took precautionary measures and cordoned off the area.  In 
the meantime contacts were made at the highest levels in the 
city of Sidon, particularly between MP Usama Saad and the 
various Palestinian factions to contain the anger and to 
prevent further escalation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Head of the Sidon municipality Abed al-Rahman 
Bizri told pol staff February 18 that Shmandur is believed 
to have a connection to MP Bahia Hariri, sister of the slain 
former PM Rafiq Hariri.  According to Bizri, Shamndur's 
mission is to establish control over al-Ta'meer 
neighborhood, a no man's land between the Ayn al-Hilweh camp 
and the city of Sidon. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Majed Mneinmeh, the general manager of the al-Liwa 
daily newspaper -- which reflects traditional Sunni views of 
politics -- told pol staff February 23, that Shmandur was 
released following several contacts between Ahmad Hariri, 
son of MP Bahia Hariri, and the military prosecutor. 
Mneimeh added that this is a serious blow to Lebanese 
institutions, particularly the judiciary, adding "how can 
the GOL call for disarming militias when a Palestinian 
gunman is released under political pressure." 
 
¶5.  We will continue to follow this affair in light of the 
various implications that it may carry.
