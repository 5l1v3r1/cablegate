SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 12. 
 
¶2. (U) The March 14 coalition, seeking to build on the 
momentum gained during the February 14, 2008 third 
commemoration of Rafiq Hariri's assassination, which rallied 
larger than expected crowds, is planning its first ever 
convention on March 14, 2008.  The convention's purpose is to 
rally local and international support for the March 14 
movement and develop coalition-wide positions on major policy 
issues.  End summary. 
 
¶3. (U) On February 29, representatives from March 14,s 
one-month old General Secretariat (reftel) briefed Embassy 
staff on plans for the first ever March 14 convention, to be 
held at the Beirut International Exhibition and Leisure 
Center (BIEL) March 14.  The representatives included March 
14 SYG Fares Suaid, Phalange regional offices director and 
advisor to former President Amine Gemayel Michel Mecattaf, 
convention coordinator Sami Nader, advisor to Defense 
Minister Elias Murr and journalist Melhem Riachi, and Daniele 
Gerges, journalist with l'Hebdo Magazine.  The draft 
presentation was emailed to NEA/ELA on February 29.  March 
14's official website is www.14March.org. 
 
GOALS 
----- 
 
¶4. (U) The convention, which aims to develop and publicize 
the March 14 coalition's program and vision and to 
reinvigorate the March 14 movement, will bring together 
approximately 1,000 participants under the slogan "Together, 
We Achieve the Lebanese Dream."  The organizers hope to 
create a "Beirut Spring 2008" paralleling that of 2005, when 
the Cedar Revolution reached its peak, resulting in an 
overwhelming parliamentary victory for March 14.  The 
convention also will include a strong youth presence, in an 
effort to promote a new generation of leaders.  Finally, the 
convention organizers intend to paint March 14 as a movement 
that celebrates life rather than the "culture of death" 
promoted by the Hizballah-led opposition. 
 
¶5. (U) The organizers intend to use the convention to send 
messages to non-Lebanese as well.  First, the international 
community, to show that people are still committed to the 
Cedar Revolution principles of freedom, democracy, 
sovereignty.  Second, to the Arab world, to demonstrate that 
Lebanon's democracy is of its own choosing, and not imposed 
by the U.S.  Third, to the Syrian people (vice regime), to 
demonstrate March 14's goodwill and determination to build a 
better relationship, and explain that the Special Tribunal is 
about justice rather than politics.  Finally, to the 
Palestinians, to show that despite past conflicts with 
individual March 14 groups (i.e., Phalange), March 14 is 
committed to developing a Palestinian policy that addresses 
both the issue of refugees in Lebanon and the broader 
Palestinian question. 
 
PROGRAM 
------- 
 
¶6. (U) The convention will consist of an opening session, 
with a welcome address by MP Samir Franjieh, followed by a 
documentary and exhibition on the history and achievements of 
the Cedar Revolution, workshops aimed at establishing unified 
March 14 positions on key issues, a closing "town hall" 
session with March 14 leaders and the press, and a 
"mega-concert" to conclude the convention. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Each workshop, which the organizers envision as 
"virtual institutions" to address state-building issues, 
comprises three key elements:  a subject matter expert, a 
March representative, and a youth representative.  The goal 
is to develop a two-page "white paper" (policy paper) to 
present to March 14 leaders.  The workshops will continue 
their work in the following two months.  Workshop topics 
 
BEIRUT 00000339  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
include state-building, Lebanese-Syrian relations, 
Lebanese-Palestinian relations, UN diplomacy and resolutions, 
relations with the Arab world, Islamic-Christian dialogue, 
the Taif Agreement, electoral reform, March 14's vision, 
mission, and organization structure, and an action plan. 
 
PARTICIPATION 
------------- 
 
¶8. (U) March 14 plans to invite Arab, U.S., and European 
diplomats and parliamentarians, local and international 
journalists, business and civil society representatives, 
academics and think tank representatives, religious leaders, 
young leaders from different sectors of society, as well as 
supporters of the 2005 Cedar Revolution to the convention. 
March 14 planned to focus especially on the participation of 
UNIFIL countries, whose troops in south Lebanon made them 
susceptible to being "held hostage" by the pro-Syrian 
opposition. 
 
ATTRACTING AOUN SUPPORTERS 
-------------------------- 
 
¶10. (U) In a bid to discredit Free Patriotic Movement leader 
Michel Aoun, Mecattaf told Pol/Econ Chief on February 26 that 
March 14 entrusted various young leaders previously aligned 
with Aoun to carry out some essential activities related to 
the convention and to chair some of the workshops.  He said 
this effort was welcomed by Aoun's former supporters as well 
as by March 14 leaders. 
 
BUDGET 
------ 
 
¶11. (SBU) Suaid told Pol/Econ Chief on February 27 that the 
Hariri family was ready to pay for all the costs associated 
with the convention.  However, he also hoped to enlist the 
support of various foundations created in the name of 
assassinated March 14 victims and of Lebanese-American groups 
in the U.S.  (Note:  March 14 often is accused as being a 
Hariri/Sunni-dominated group, especially by opposition 
Christians seeking to undermine its support.  End note.) 
 
ACTION REQUEST 
-------------- 
 
¶12. (SBU) To maximize international participation in the 
convention and demonstrate strong international support for 
the March 14 majority, Post requests that Department demarche 
key Arab and European (especially UNIFIL) capitals, as well 
as the EU and UN, encouraging them to be represented at the 
convention.  Recognizing that time is short, post also would 
welcome Department's suggestions for names of members of 
Congress and prominent Lebanese-Americans in the business, 
civil society, religious, academic and think tank communities 
to whom March 14 should extend invitations to the Convention. 
 End action request.
