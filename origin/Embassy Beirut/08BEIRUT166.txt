SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) New UNIIIC Commissioner and Prosecutor-Designate 
Daniel Bellemare believes time is running out for the Special 
Tribunal and "failure is not an option."  UNIIIC was "clearly 
making process," but needs member states' urgent assistance 
in putting together the pieces of the puzzle and increasing 
UNIIIC's "operational tempo."  UNIIIC is investigating the 
January 25 assassination of Internal Security Forces (ISF) 
official Wissam Eid, who had been working with UNIIIC on the 
Hariri and other investigations, bringing its total workload 
to 20 cases. 
 
¶2. (C) Bellemare stressed that the process that began with 
the 2005 Hariri assassination leading up to the transition to 
the Special Tribunal is irreversible.  However, legal and 
security considerations mandated that he not name names until 
the Tribunal is operational and, as Prosecutor, he issues 
substantiated indictments.  He conveyed several requests for 
USG assistance, which post will transmit separately.   End 
summary. 
 
TIME IS RUNNING OUT 
------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) The Charge, accompanied by Pol/Econ Chief, met with 
new UN International Independent Investigation Commission 
(UNIIIC) Commissioner and Prosecutor-Designate Daniel 
Bellemare and UNIIIC investigator Stacy de la Torre at UNIIIC 
headquarters on January 31.  Bellemare said time was running 
out for the Special Tribunal, and he is increasing UNIIIC's 
"tempo of operations" in response.  In particular, he is 
seeking ways to remove bureaucratic and other obstacles 
delaying responses to UNIIIC's request for resources and 
assistance from member states. 
 
¶4. (C) Rather than spending time drafting detailed requests 
for information relating to specific events, he planned to 
send out generic "menus" of broad categories of assistance 
from which member states, via their embassies in Beirut, 
would indicate where they would help.  Only then would UNIIIC 
prepare formal requests, customized according to each 
country's abilities and interests.  This way, he explained, 
no one could say they hadn't provided information because 
UNIIIC had never asked.  Furthermore, this would result in 
UNIIIC receiving information it might not otherwise have 
thought to request, information that could help it "connect 
the dots."  "We're trying to find ways to help you say yes," 
he explained. 
 
¶5. (C) Low profile member states could assist in interviewing 
witnesses, Bellemare uggested.  UNIIIC also needed countries 
to provie experts on the ground, especially for 
communictions analysis.  By working in Lebanon, these 
experts would benefit from interaction with UNIIIC colleagues 
and be able to "immerse" themselves in the investigation, 
which would help them to understand better the big picture. 
(Note:  Post will send Bellemare's generic request for 
assistance and job descriptions for experts to NEA/ELA.  End 
note.) 
 
...AND THEN THERE WERE 20 
------------------------- 
 
¶6. (S) Bellemare confirmed that UNIIIC was providing the GOL 
with technical assistance in the investigation into the 
January 25 assassination of Internal Security Forces (ISF) 
Officer Wissam Eid (Ref A), who had been working on the 
Hariri and other assassinations.  However, the GOL's request 
for UNIIIC assistance had not been as immediate as in prior 
assassinations (probably because the ISF was heavily involved 
in the initial investigation, he commented), delaying the 
arrival of UNIIIC's forensics team until February 4, ten days 
after the attack. 
 
¶7. (S) Noting that Eid had been involved in telecom analysis 
relating to the Hariri and other assassinations (and had 
visited UNIIIC a week earlier to provide an update), as well 
as to Hizballah's activities,  Bellemare said the attack 
suggested two theories:  an attempt to block progress on the 
Tribunal or to prevent the GOL from investigating Hizballah. 
Either way, he said, Eid's assassination showed the assassins 
were circling in, and UNIIIC had to adapt its modus operandi 
in response. 
 
¶8. (C) UNIIIC is now involved in 20 investigations, 
stretching its already limited resources even further.  De la 
Torre noted that UNIIIC's tendency is to focus on earlier 
(especially the Hariri) investigations before addressing 
recent attacks, but admitted that the prospects for fresh 
evidence require UNIIIC to shift its resources, at least 
temporarily.  (Note:  The GOL did not/not request UNIIIC 
assistance in the investigation of the January 15 attack 
against a U.S. Embassy vehicle that injured two local 
employees.  Embassy Legatt's assessment is that GOL 
determined they did not need UNIIIC assistance because USG 
provided assistance of an FBI/DS joint team for several days 
early in the investigation of that attack.  End note.) 
 
NO NAMES IN NEXT REPORT 
----------------------- 
 
¶9. (C) Bellemare stated clearly that UNIIIC's next report to 
the UN (due late March) would not, consistent with previous 
reports, name names, for the same legal and security reasons 
cited by his predecessor, Serge Brammertz.  Because of 
international legal standards protecting the rights of the 
accused, names could only be used in the indictments 
themselves, along with evidence substantiating the 
accusations.  And, Bellemare noted grimly, as the Eid 
assassination demonstrated, security considerations mandated 
confidentiality, especially to protect witnesses and 
investigators until the Tribunal was ready. 
 
¶10. (C) Bellemare cautioned against expectations, once the 
Tribunal was operational, that names would be forthcoming 
immediately, stressing that indictments would take some time. 
 However, as Prosecutor-Designate for the Tribunal, he was 
viewing the investigations through the eyes of a prosecutor, 
building a case with the standards of international justice 
in mind. Unfortunately, he said, former UNIIIC Commissioner 
Mehlis' recent attack in the press on Brammertz (which he 
deemed "unethical" and the result of a personal grudge) 
raised expectations for the first Bellemare report.  However, 
he stressed, "I did not come out of retirement to be a 
failure." 
 
SHAKING THE TREE 
---------------- 
 
¶11. (C) A former Canadian magistrate, retired only two months 
when he was appointed to replace Serge Brammertz as UNIIIC 
Commissioner, Bellemare admitted to being a stranger to the 
UN system and surprised at the number of administrative 
issues requiring his attention (Ref B).  However, his Chief 
of Staff has 18 years of experience within the UN structure, 
he said, which is "half the battle" in working with UN 
bureaucracy.  Moreover, people are bending over backwards to 
help and showing a lot of good will, although he did not know 
how long this "honeymoon" period would last.  Unfortunately, 
he added, recent assassinations only reconfirm the importance 
of his mission. 
 
¶12. (C) Bellemare also said he intended to provide a "lessons 
learned" package for future UN commissioners, addressing 
investigative, recruitment, and other issues.  UN policies 
did not make it suited for operational investigations, he 
said, and this package could help future UN tribunals, e.g., 
on the Bhutto assassination. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶13. (C) Bellemare's lack of UN credentials may work to his 
advantage.  He struck us as someone who will have little 
tolerance for obstructionist UN bureaucracy; on the contrary, 
he made it clear that he has communicated UNIIIC's sense of 
urgency to New York.  Not beholden to the UN (i.e., not 
motivated by personal ambitions for future UN appointments), 
he will not be afraid to shake the system to get what he 
needs to move the process forward. 
 
¶14. (C) In addition, his role as Prosecutor-Designate is 
clearly shaping his approach to the investigtions.  We give 
him a preliminary "A" for effort nd determination, and urge 
Washington to make evry effort to comply with UNIIIC's 
requests for information and assistance.  End comment.
