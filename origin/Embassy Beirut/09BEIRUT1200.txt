(SBU) We delivered reftel demarche to MFA desk officers Reina 
Charbel and Hassan Saleh on November 3.  Charbel informed us 
that Lebanon intended to vote in favor of whatever resolution 
on the Goldstone Report is tabled by the Arab League, but 
said that the MFA would nonetheless inform the Lebanese 
mission in New York of the U.S. position.
