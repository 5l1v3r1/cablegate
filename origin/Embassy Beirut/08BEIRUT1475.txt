U.S. OFFICIALS PROMOTE BUSINESS TIES WITH LEBANON AT MADE IN 
AMERICA 
------------- 
 
¶1. (U) For the first time since 2005, the Embassy and FCS sponsored 
the Made in America exposition of American products October 9-11. 
Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the Foreign 
Commercial Service Israel Hernandez and U.S. Ambassador Michele 
Sison, along with Lebanese Minister of Economy and Trade Mohammad 
Safadi, launched the fourth Made in American fair at the BIEL 
Center.  The fair showcased more than 270 U.S. companies doing 
business in Lebanon, bringing the latest in technology and services 
to Lebanon's fast-growing market.  Participation has tripled since 
the event was first held in 2003, highlighting the strength of 
U.S-Lebanon commercial ties.  The event also included conferences on 
deepening commercial relationships between the U.S. and MENA region 
and Lebanon's WTO accession. 
 
2009 BUDGET LAW READY 
TO GO TO CABINET 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Rola Azour, head of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Economic 
Unit, told us on October 6 that the MOF has completed the 2009 
budget law proposal, which Finance Minister Chatah will submit to 
the cabinet for approval when he returns from the World Bank/IMF 
Annual Meetings in Washington.  The proposal includes two 
revenue-generating measures: raising the tax on interest on deposits 
from five to seven percent, and collecting rent on seashore 
properties.  These measures cover part of the $500 million 
additional cost resulting from recent minimum wage and public sector 
salary increases, she noted.  Azour stressed that there will be no 
increase in VAT in 2009 as it would not be politically feasible. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The MOF has secured a large part of its foreign currency 
financing needs for 2008, Azour said, and cannot borrow further in 
foreign currencies in the absence of legislation.  The MOF is 
waiting for parliament to approve the 2006, 2007, and 2008 budget 
laws, which were never passed during the political stagnation of the 
past two years.  Azour believes parliament will pass the three 
budget laws by the end of the year; once passed, this would give the 
GOL the possibility to borrow up to approximately six billion 
dollars to meet its foreign currency needs, she remarked. 
 
NO NEWS ON SAUDI PLEDGE FOR 
ADDITIONAL ONE BILLION DOLLAR DEPOSIT 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Azour also told us that the Saudis had taken no action on 
their pledge last February to deposit an additional one billion 
dollars at the Central Bank of Lebanon (CBL) to strengthen its 
foreign currency assets.  During the July 2006 war, Saudi Arabia 
deposited one billion dollars at the CBL to strengthen foreign 
currency assets and maintain stability in the foreign exchange 
market. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Meanwhile, the Director of Economic Affairs at the 
Presidency, Dr. Elie Assaf, told us October 8 that President Sleiman 
will raise this issue during his visit to Saudi Arabia on October 
¶12.  Although Sleiman's trip is of a more political nature, the 
President will also raise bilateral economic issues, Assaf told us.

EDL CHAIRMAN IN EGYPT TO NEGOTIATE 
LOWER ELECTRICITY PRICE 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Chairman of national power utility Electricite du Liban 
(EDL) Kamal Hayek was in Egypt October 8-9 for additional 
negotiations on possible Egyptian electricity supply to Lebanon. 
Egypt has offered to sell Lebanon 150 megawatts of surplus 
electricity, but at a price indexed to the cost of heavy fuel, which 
both Hayek and Energy Minister Alain Tabourian have told the Embassy 
they will not accept.  If an agreement is reached, the 
infrastructure is in place for electricity to reach Lebanon via 
Syria, and EDL will be able to supply an additional two to three 
hours per day of electricity all over Lebanon, Tabourian told us. 
 
PARLIAMENT APPROVES NEW MEASURE TO COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING, 
AND LEBANON'S ADHERENCE TO CORRUPTION CONVENTION 
-------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) On October 8, parliament approved a law expanding powers of 
investigators into cases of money laundering to include funds 
originating from corruption.  The parliament agreed that Lebanon 
will adhere to the UN Convention Against Corruption. 
 
¶8. (U) In addition, Parliament adopted a law dropping fines by 90 
percent on overdue car-inspection fees and municipality fees for 
2006, 2007, and 2008, provided settlement is reached before the end 
of 2008.  This measure aims to encourage citizens to pay pending 
dues and replenish the state coffers. 
 
U.S. TREASURY HOSTS CONFERENCE TO 
STRENGTHEN U.S.-ARAB BANKERS' COOPERATION 
-------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) The Union of Arab Banks (UAB), based in Beirut, and the U.S. 
Treasury Department jointly organized the fourth U.S.-MENA Private 
Sector Dialogue (PSD) Conference on October 9 at the U.S. Treasury, 
on the margins of the World Bank/IMF annual meetings in Washington, 
D.C.  This event aims to strengthen the relationship between Arab 
and American bankers on international banking issues and combating 
money laundering and terrorism finance. 
 
ISLAMIC BANK INTERESTED IN 
OPENING A BRANCH IN THE U.S. 
-------------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) Fouad Matraji, General Manager of Lebanon's largest 
Islamic bank, Arab Finance House (AFH), told us October 8 that he 
will meet with U.S. Treasury Assistant Secretary Eric Solomon to 
explain Islamic banking and the necessary amendments in U.S. 
legislation for such banks to exist in the U.S.  Matraji explained 
that this is timely given the international financial crisis, adding 
that Islamic banking is the safest way to invest money since 
investment is backed by real assets and there is no leveraging. 
(Note:  Islamic banking prohibits interest, and provides for sharing 
in profit and loss.  End note.)  Matraji will be accompanied by 
senior officials from AFH's major shareholder, Qatar Islamic Bank 
(QIB), who also met last year with senior officials at the Federal 
Reserve Board expressing QIB interest in opening a branch in the 
U.S. 
 
LEBANON PERCEIVED AS A PLATFORM FOR ARAB 
BANKING EXPANSION IN LEVANT 
-------------------- 
 
¶11. (U) On October 8, Bank of Sharjah officially announced its 
acquisition of Banque Nationale de Paris Intercontinentale's (BNPI) 
operations in Lebanon.  The new joint-holding will be known as 
Emirates Lebanon Bank (ELB). Bank of Sharjah will hold 81 percent of 
ELB shares, while French BNPI will retain 19 percent.  With this 
acquisition, Bank of Sharjah continues its expansion into Lebanon's 
banking sector.  Last year, it acquired Banque de la Bekaa from 
Fransabank, one of Lebanon's top ten banks.  ELB Chairman/GM Varouj 
Nerguizian indicated that Lebanon is a platform for the bank's 
expansion into Syria and Iraq. 
 
CHINESE MILK IMPORTS 
STOPPED FOLLOWING SCANDAL 
-------------------- 
 
BEIRUT 00001475  003 OF 003 
 
 
 
¶12. (U) The Lebanese Ministry of Agriculture decided on October 6 to 
stop the import of Chinese powder milk and related products, and to 
remove all those already in the market, following the recent tainted 
milk scandal in China.  According to the Ministry, Lebanon imports 
around 500 tons of powder milk from China each year.
