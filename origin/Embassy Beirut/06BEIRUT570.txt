SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) Hizballah organized a mass rally to protest the 
bombing of a Shia shrine in Iraq.  More than 100,000 persons 
gathered in the Southern Suburbs on February 23.  Hizballah 
SYG Nasrallah delivered a speech calling on Shia to remain 
calm and to avoid provocations between the Shia and the 
Sunni, which he said, benefit the US administration, Israel 
and the "Takfiriyyin" (provocateurs).  Nasrallah said that 
the U.S. administration uses the tension in Iraq to justify 
its occupation of the country.  Israel, Nasrallah claimed, 
also benefits because from Sunni-Shia tensions because 
violence would further destroy Iraq by igniting a Sunni-Shia 
war. 
Nasrallah also warned against any retribution against Sunnis 
in Lebanon for attacks by Sunni against Shia in Iraq.  He 
described attacks by individuals, seeking retribution, as 
treason against Islam.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U)  The streets of south Beirut were filled on February 
23 by more than one hundred thousand demonstrators answering 
the call of Hizballah to demonstrate solidarity with Shia 
Moslems murdered in sectarian violence in Iraq.  The 
demonstrations were well-attended, even though called on 
about three hours' notice.  Although the event was billed as 
an Iraq event, the opening speakers made clear their 
opposition to the United States, calling the U.S. the mother 
of terrorism.  Organizers were careful not to fan the flames 
of growing confessional tensions in Lebanon; they repeatedly 
called for calm and peaceful response to the Iraq 
provocations, and most notably the explosion at the Samarra 
Mosque.  However, Nasrallah was clearly speaking to his 
March 14 Coalition local political-adversaries when he 
warned all political parties against using the street to 
impose their will on all the Lebanese.  "This is a very 
dangerous game and we shall not accept it, and the only way 
to solve our pressing problems is through consensus and 
dialogue," he added. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Comment:  This demonstration may give pause to 
those on the other side of the political fence (i.e., the 
March 14 Coalition) as it considers a major march on the 
Presidential palce in Baabda.  Nasrallah has demonstrated 
that he could convene a demonstration of considerable size 
on a few hours' notice.  This fact will weigh on Christians 
and Sunni as they think about whether to take their 
political grievances to the street.  End comment.
