REF: STATE 076193 
 
Embassy Beirut reported three commercial success stories for the 
period February through June 2009.  Below is a summary of these 
success stories. 
 
 
¶1. Date: February 2009 
Post: Beirut 
Country: Lebanon 
Company: LTM International Inc. 
Company Headquarters (State & zip code): FL 34202 
Issue/project: Sale of $32,000 worth of apparel. 
Specific Actions Taken:  CS Beirut, in cooperation with the New York 
Export Assistance Center (NYEAC), connected U.S. firm LTM/Bejeweled 
Apparel to a major Lebanese clothing importer.  As a result of 
Embassy and NYEAC counseling sessions, LTM/Bejeweled Apparel signed 
new contracts with the importer worth $32,000. 
 
¶2. Date: February 23, 2009 
Post: Beirut 
Country: Lebanon 
Company: GE Infrastructure 
Company Headquarters (State & zip code): FL 34202 
Issue/project:  GE Infrastructure signed agency agreement in 
Lebanon 
Specific Actions Taken:  The U.S. firm General Electric (GE) 
requested that Embassy Beirut conduct due diligence on the Lebanese 
firm Consulting & Solution Provider (CSP).  GE asked for Embassy 
feedback before signing an agency agreement with CSP.  Embassy 
Beirut gathered information about CSP and submitted a detailed 
report to GE with a positive recommendation, encouraging GE to do 
business with CSP.  As a result of Embassy Beirut's report, GE 
signed an agency agreement with CSP, which will allow GE to increase 
its market share in the safety and security sector in Lebanon. 
 
¶3. Date: June 18, 2009 
Post: Beirut 
Country: Lebanon 
Company: Motorola Inc. 
Company Headquarters (State & zip code): IL 60196 
Issue/project: Motorola opened its first operational office in 
Beirut. 
Specific Actions Taken:  Motorola was put on Lebanon's Arab League 
boycott list more than 10 years ago.  However, given Lebanon's 
technical need for Motorola's products, the boycott office in 
Lebanon allowed Motorola to sell its products in Lebanon through a 
Lebanese agent, but banned Motorola from having an operational 
office to market, advertise and sell these products. 
 
Given the growing demand for Motorola products in Lebanon, Motorola 
decided it was crucial that it open an office in Lebanon.  Its 
senior management (based in Dubai) came to the Embassy and asked for 
our advocacy with the Lebanese PM and Minister of Economy to remove 
Motorola from the boycott list.  As a result of the Embassy's 
advocacy efforts, the cabinet finally issued a decree on June 18, 
2009, allowing Motorola to register its office in Lebanon.
