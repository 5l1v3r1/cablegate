LEBANON SUBMITS PETITION TO 
INCREASE ITS EXPORTS UNDER GSP 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) As part of the USTR's evaluations of ongoing country 
practices for the general system of preferences (GSP), the 
Association of Lebanese Industrialists (ALI) submitted a petition to 
include all Lebanese exports to the U.S. under the GSP program.  In 
2008, Lebanese exports to the U.S. were valued at around $49 
million, around 50% of which benefited from GSP. 
 
CONTROL IMPROVES ON THE LEBANESE-SYRIAN 
NORTHERN BORDER CROSSING 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On June 24, Lebanese Customs and Surete Generale moved 
their northern border offices in Abboudieh closer to the Dabbousieh 
Syrian border.  This move is part of a plan to better control the 
border crossing between the two countries and develop the 
infrastructure to meet international standards, Director General of 
Customs General Assaad Ghanem told us on June 25. Ghanem said the 
move falls within UNSCR 1701 regarding border controls and improving 
control by the Common Border Forces (Surete Generale, Customs, 
police, and army) for the passage of goods and people. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ghanem said that customs and Surete Generale have also 
established a presence at the Bukaiya northern border crossing, thus 
legalizing this passage, and preparations will start to move Customs 
and Surete Generale offices at the Qa' border crossing (northern 
Bekaa) closer to the Syrian border, establish a presence in Hermel, 
and rehabilitate the Arida northern crossing.  The entire project is 
expected to be completed in 2010, Ghanem said. 
 
MOTOROLA ALLOWED TO OPEN 
AN OFFICE IN LEBANON 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) On June 18, the cabinet issued a decree allowing U.S. firm 
Motorola to register and open an office in Lebanon, after three 
years of post advocacy on behalf of the company.  Motorola was put 
on Lebanon's boycott list of businesses with a relationship with 
Israel more than ten years ago.  With this, Motorola was banned from 
having an operational office to market, advertise, and sell its 
products, though it was permitted to sell its products through a 
Lebanese agent.  Motorola's country manager Rabah Zarzour told us 
the decree was supported by the Ministers of Telecommunications and 
Economy and Trade, as well as Prime Minister Siniora. 
 
35 SWINE FLU CASES 
-------------- 
 
¶5. (U) On June 26, the Ministry of Public Health announced that the 
number of swine flu cases reached 35, up from 20 at the end of last 
week.  All patients are in the process of recovery, the ministry 
noted.  No deaths have been attributed to the flu in Lebanon.
