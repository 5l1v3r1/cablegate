". . . The Cobra," a column (08/03) by Leon Roldos in 
Quito's leading centrist "El Comercio" (circ. 70,000) 
 
Quote:  "There has been a great amount of gnashing of 
teeth over the conversations [going on] between 
Ecuadorian and Chavez's governments. . . with some 
contending that the intention behind these talks is 
to modify South  American geopolitics . 
 
"What is needed is to duly assess the terms 
presented, while avoiding any sign of dependency, 
which could become suffocating."
