SUBJECT: MFA OFFERS VOTE SWAP ON U.S. ICTY NOMINEE 
 
REF: STATE 218465 
 
¶1. In response to Reftel, the Embassy October 12 delivered to 
the Ecuadorian foreign ministry a non-paper and CV in support 
of Judge Theodor Meron, the USG's candidate for re-election 
to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former 
Yugoslavia.  In a follow-up meeting October 14, Luis 
Arellano, the MFA's office director for UN affairs, told 
Poloff that Ecuador's UN mission was receiving CVs and 
candidacy letters from numerous countries.  In early 
November, the mission would assemble the package, attach a 
recommendation, and pouch the materials to Quito for the 
MFA's final determination. 
 
¶2.  Arellano agreed that Judge Meron's qualifications were 
impressive, but offered no hint of Ecuador's intended vote. 
The GoE had no candidate in the ICTY election, but was 
looking for USG support for MFA Legal Advisor Marcelo 
Vasquez, Ecuador's nominee for the International Law 
Commission.  Aware (from prior Embassy demarches) the USG did 
not engage in vote trading, Arellano nonetheless pitched a 
tit-for-tat arangement. 
 
¶3.  Post requests instructions should Department wish to 
break from standard practice and support a vote swap for the 
USG's ICTY candidate.
