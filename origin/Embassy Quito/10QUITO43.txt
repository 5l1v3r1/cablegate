SUBJECT: Ecuador: H1N1 Update 
 
¶1.  As of January 22, there were 2,251 cases of H1N1 reported in 
Ecuador, with 96 confirmed fatalities.  The first H1N1 infection in 
Ecuador was recorded in May of 2009, and roughly 70% of the 
reported cases have affected people between the ages of one and 29. 
The disease is concentrated primarily in Ecuador's two most 
populous provinces: Pichincha, a largely mountainous province that 
includes the capital Quito, and Guayas, home of Ecuador's largest 
city of Guayaquil.  The virus has also made its way into the more 
remote areas of eastern Ecuador, but poor reporting has made it 
difficult to gauge the severity of the problem.  The Ministry of 
Health (MOH) believes the disease is now endemic within Quito and 
Guayaquil.  The MOH believes H1N1 poses a low to moderate threat to 
the population.  Although reporting standards vary between 
countries in the region, the available data suggest that the impact 
of H1N1 in Ecuador has been roughly on par with other Andean 
nations.

Government Action and Press 
 
 
 
¶2.  Recent efforts to combat the virus in Ecuador have been mostly 
confined to limited quarantine efforts and the targeted provision 
of anti-viral medication.  The Government of Ecuador (GOE) has a 
website to educate citizens about H1N1, disseminate flu-related 
information, and inform health providers of the protocols for 
patients with flu symptoms (http://www.msp.gov.ec).  A new 
laboratory recently opened in Quito to speed testing in the 
northern provinces; prior to December 2009 the only way to confirm 
H1N1 was to send samples to Guayaquil for lab work.  Ecuador is 
currently waiting on a shipment of roughly 900,000 vaccine doses 
from the Pan American Health Organization for allotment to 
high-risk groups -- pregnant women, the chronically ill, and the 
obese -- expected in the first quarter of 2010.  The vaccine was 
originally scheduled to arrive in November, and the MOH is 
currently planning for the final week of February/first week of 
March.  Vaccine distribution todate has been essentially 
non-existent. 
 
 
 
¶3.  Media coverage of the H1N1 pandemic was common in the second 
and third quarters of 2009, peaking when President Correa's Chief 
of Security, Col. John Merino, died in September 2009 after a month 
of sickness.  Ecuador's new Foreign Minister, Ricardo PatiC1o, who 
used to work at the Presidency, also became sick and was 
hospitalized in August 2009.  Since then the focus on H1N1 has 
diminished.  Press citations generally focus on the uncertainty 
surrounding the arrival date of the H1N1 vaccine. 
 
 
 
Vaccine available at the Embassy 
 
 
 
¶4.  Embassy Quito received approximately 300 doses of H1N1 vaccine 
January 12.  The H1N1 nasal spray and injection are available for 
U.S. direct-hire employees, their families aged 6 months and above, 
and LES staff.  Todate approximately 100 doses of the vaccine have 
been administered.
