SUBJECT: GOE RATIFIES INTER-AMERICAN CONVENTION AGAINST 
TERRORISM 
 
 
¶1.  (U) The Ecuadorian Congress ratified the Inter-American 
Convention Against Terrorism (IACAT) on May 9.  The 
Convention was subsequently signed by President Palacio, and 
was sent to OAS headquarters on July 14.  Ecuador is awaiting 
confirmation from its OAS delegation of the date of deposit 
of the ratification.  Adopted by the OAS on June 3, 2002, the 
Convention seeks to prevent the financing of terrorist 
activities, strengthen border controls, and increase law 
enforcement cooperation, among other measures.  With 
Congress's May 9 decision, Ecuador becomes the 18th of 33 
signatories to ratify the Convention. 
 
¶2.  Comment: Post will closely monitor implementation of the 
Convention here, which could, if managed effectively in 
combination with the anti-money laundering law passed in 
2005, help the GOE confront terrorist activities in Ecuador.
