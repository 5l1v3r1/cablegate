SUBJECT: Ecuador - Information on Security Dialogue 
 
REF: STATE 112900; QUITO 885; QUITO 570; 08 QUITO 1128 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Andrew Chritton, Charge d'Affaires; REASON: 1.4(A), 
(B), (D) 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Embassy Quito responds to the questions in Ref A, as 
follows: 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Does the United States currently have an established 
security dialogue with your country? 
 
 
 
Answer.  The U.S. and Ecuador have a Bilateral Dialogue mechanism 
to discuss a range of issues of bilateral interest, including four 
pillars: Security, Trade and Investment, Technical Assistance, and 
Migratory Issues.  The discussion of security so far has been 
limited primarily to law enforcement-related issues.  However, 
under the Security pillar, "Security Cooperation in the Northern 
Border Region" was included in 2009 to allow for a discussion of 
military to military assistance and cooperation in Ecuador's 
northern border region. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) When was the dialogue or mechanism first established?  By 
what means was it established?  Is the frequency of such meetings 
controlled through a binding agreement, or is this dialogue 
regulated by an informal understanding? 
 
 
 
Answer.  The USG and GOE agreed to a Bilateral Dialogue mechanism 
in 2008, and held its first plenary in Quito on November 24, 2008 
(Ref D).  On July 8, 2009, Coordinating Minister of Internal and 
External Security Miguel Carvajal requested (Ref C) that security 
be added as a pillar to the agenda for the second plenary, which 
took place on November 10, 2009, in Washington.  The USG agreed and 
negotiated the content of the Security pillar with the GOE. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) When did the group last meet?  Does the USG or host 
government have a set schedule or any general expectations 
regarding the frequency of this exchange?  When is the next 
scheduled meeting? 
 
 
 
Answer.  Although there is no formal agreement on the schedule for 
Bilateral Dialogue meetings, the GOE stated during planning 
meetings that it would like the Bilateral Dialogue to meet annually 
in plenary, and working groups to meet more frequently to explore 
opportunities for cooperation and plan for plenary meetings. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Does the USG or host government hold any expectations as 
to the level of leadership hosting the exchange? 
 
 
 
Answer.  Plenary meetings to date have been led by an Assistant 
Secretary or DAS for the USG and an Under Secretary for the GOE. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (C) PM would also be interested in Post's brief, honest 
assessment regarding the overall utility of the dialogue.  Are new 
issues frequently broached, or has the dialogue devolved into a 
stagnant exchange of power point slides?  If necessary, please use 
classified communication to convey this honest assessment. 
 
Answer.  The Bilateral Dialogue is a relatively new mechanism, and 
to date the plenary meetings have had extensive agendas that 
allowed both countries delegations to express only very brief 
statements on each topic.  Military cooperation with the U.S. has 
been a sensitive topic with the GOE, which has been critical of 
U.S. military presence at the Forward Operating Location at Manta 
(now closed) and in Colombia following negotiations of the 
U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement.  The GOE is generally 
very testy on any subject that it might perceive as an affront on 
its sovereignty.  It has publicly asserted the need to diversify 
its military relations with other countries (lessening dependence 
on the USG) and has been extremely skittish with regard to military 
to military relations with the U.S. (Ref B).  While we do not 
expect significant security-related decisions to be taken at the 
Bilateral Dialogue, the Dialogue is useful as an education 
mechanism and one that keeps open the lines of communication.
