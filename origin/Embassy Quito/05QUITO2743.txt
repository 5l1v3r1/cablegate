¶2.  Until October, Ecuador,s money laundering law had been 
woefully inadequate.  After significant efforts by Post, 
particularly the Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS), Ecuador 
recently passed a vastly improved (though not perfect) money 
laundering law.  NAS is also working with the Organization of 
American States (OAS) Inter-American Drug Abuse Control 
Commission (CICAD) on a program to develop a Financial 
Investigations Unit (FIU) to help more effectively implement 
the new law.  The Political and Public Affairs sections have 
used private and public diplomacy to increase support for 
combating money laundering, while the Econ section works with 
the Superintendent of Banks and others on the issue, with 
special attention to terrorist financing.  DEA investigations 
also contribute to these mission objectives. 
 
¶3.  Our key short-term priorities are the effective 
implementation of the new money laundering law and more 
effective regulation of the banking sector.  Post would 
welcome any program of technical assistance that would help 
us meet those priorities.
