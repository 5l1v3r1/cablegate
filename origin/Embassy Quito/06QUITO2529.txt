REF: A. STATE 171921 
 
     ¶B. QUITO 2262 
     ¶C. QUITO 2252 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Linda Jewell for reasons 1.4 (B&D) 
 
¶1.  (C) Per instruction in Ref A, the Ambassador discussed 
the UNSC race with Foreign Minister Francisco Carrion at 
length on October 13.  Carrion said Ecuador is still studying 
the issue and President Palacio will make the decision 
sometime before Monday's vote.  MFA sources tell us Carrion 
will discuss the UNSC race with his Chilean counterpart 
before making a final recommendation to Palacio. 
 
¶2.  (C) Carrion told the Ambassador he was aware of the 
arguments in favor of Guatemala and against Venezuela, and 
was personally very concerned about how Venezuela's possible 
membership in the UNSC could affect its functioning. 
However, he admitted privately that domestic political 
developments will play a part in the decision. 
 
¶3.  (C) The Ambassador stressed the importance of a fully 
functioning UNSC.  If Ecuador truly cares about the UN, it 
must show it.  Carrion said he did not think either country 
had the votes to win; the Ambassador countered that Ecuador 
should not kid itself that a vote for Venezuela would not 
matter--it could mean the difference.  Carrion agreed about 
the risk, and gave the impression he favored abstention. 
¶4.  (C) Carrion mentioned that some recent interactions with 
the GOV had not been positive.  At the Non-Aligned Movement 
summit in Havana, Chavez and Palacio were scheduled to talk 
about petroleum projects, but Chavez kept Palacio waiting; 
Palacio became annoyed and left.  During a visit to Quito 
this week by the Venezuelan Foreign Minister, Maduro raised 
the UNSC race only shortly before his departure.  Carrion 
claims he told Maduro that the GOE was considering the issue, 
but had not decided on its vote. 
¶5.  (C) Carrion said he would talk to the President again 
about this issue today but does not expect an immediate 
decision.  Carrion also expects a number of rounds of voting 
and said he was willing to be in close touch with the Embassy 
on Monday.  He was not sure whether Palacio would give UN 
PermRep Cordova general instructions and let him proceed, or 
discuss each round of voting with him. 
¶6.  (C) The Ambassador told Carrion that the U.S. 
Administration would work for ATPDEA extension.  Carrion was 
delighted, saying a statement to that effect would be 
welcomed here. 
¶7.  (C) Comment: The Ambassador's conversation with Carrion 
tracks previous dialogues with GOE officials on the issue 
(Refs B and C).  Carrion's professed discomfort with the 
prospect of a Venezuelan presence on the UNSC is not new 
either.  What is new here is the growing prospect of election 
victory by radical leftist Rafael Correa, which clearly gives 
the current GOE pause before taking positions relating to 
Venezuela. 
 
¶8.  (C) Recommendation:  Our impression is that Carrion would 
recommend abstention until a viable third candidate emerges. 
However, it is clear the decision rests with Palacio, and the 
best opportunity to influence it lies in the Secretary's 
planned call to him.  In addition to the arguments on this 
issue, it might be useful also to note that a vote for 
Venezuela would make it harder for the administration to 
convince Congress to extend ATPDEA preferences for Ecuador.
