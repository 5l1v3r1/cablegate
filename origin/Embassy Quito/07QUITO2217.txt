Â¶1.  (SBU) PolOff met with Lourdes Puma, MFA Director General 
of Multilateral Affairs, on September 25, and shared U.S. 
objectives on the Community of Democracies.  Puma said that 
Ecuador would definitely not attend the meeting on the 
margins of the UNGA chaired by Mali on October 1.  She 
doubted that Ecuador would attend the Ministerial in Bamako, 
Mali, on November 15-17.  She added that Ecuador has thus far 
not participated in the Community of Democracies 
ministerials.  As Puma appeared somewhat unfamiliar with the 
Community of Democracies, PolOff provided some additional 
background material.  Puma said she would confirm Ecuador's 
attendance or non-attendance at the Ministerial at a later 
date.
