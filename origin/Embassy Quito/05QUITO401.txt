¶1.   On February 15, PolOffs delivered a non paper on 
consolidating support for Haitian elections (Reftel) to Paulo 
Moreno, the head of the MFA's UN Affairs office, as well as 
to MFA Human Rights Director General Julio Prado.  On 
February 17, Moreno told PolOff that the GOE considers 
promoting stability and democracy in Haiti a high priority. 
They are working multilaterally through the UN and MINUSTAH 
to this effect.  The GOE feels that by contributing troops to 
MINUSTAH, they are increasing security in Haiti which is 
conducive to democratic stability in the hemisphere.  Moreno 
said that the GOE may also send election observers to Haiti 
under the OAS. 
 
¶2.  The Ambassador raised the GOE's MINUSTAH troop 
contribution at her February 16 meeting with Ecuador's Joint 
Forces Chief Victor Rosero and other Armed Forces chiefs. 
The GOE officials responded that Ecuador would be rotating 
another group of approximately 64 engineers into Haiti in 
May, replacing the current contingent for another six-month 
deployment.
