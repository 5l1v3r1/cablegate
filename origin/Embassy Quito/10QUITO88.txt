SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR SOURCE/ORIGIN WAIVER: PROCUREMENT OF VEHICLES 
FOR GOE DINAPEN POLICE UNIT 
 
¶1.  Issue: Post requests a source origin waiver from geographic 
code 000 (United States only) to geographic code 935 (special free 
world) to permit the procurement of vehicles in the Host Country 
local market for operational use by the Ecuadorian National 
Police's DINAPEN Guayaquil unit. 
 
 
 
Cooperating Country: Ecuador 
 
 
 
Authorizing document: LOA dated August 25, 2009. 
 
 
 
Project: Migrant Smuggling Program 
 
 
 
Nature of funding: FY-08 G-TIP Program 
 
 
 
Description of commodity: Foreign-manufactured vehicles: 
 
 
 
Quantity 3 - 4 door Sedan, 1.6 liter, manual transmission, air 
conditioning 
 
 
 
Approximate total value: USD $50,000.00 
 
Origin: Special Free World 
 
Source: Ecuador 
 
Contracting agent: RPSO 
 
 
 
¶2. Discussion: These vehicles are for operational use by the 
DINAPEN Guayaquil police unit.  DINAPEN is the Government of 
Ecuador's human trafficking police unit which cooperates closely 
with DHS/ICE office.  Funding for these vehicles comes from the 
migrant smuggling program.  For the security of its personnel and 
on-going operations, it is highly recommended for DINAPEN to use 
nondescript vehicles that are locally common rather than the more 
conspicuous and distinctive U.S.-made vehicles. 
 
 
 
¶3. Recommendation:  For the reasons stated above, we recommend 
approval of this request for a source/origin waiver to permit 
acquisition of these project vehicles in Ecuador. 
 
 
 
¶4. Please expedite reply. Thank you.

Section, U.S. Embassy, Quito, Ecuador.
