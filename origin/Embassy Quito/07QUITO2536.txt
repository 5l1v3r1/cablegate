(SBU) Poloff delivered background information on the 4th 
Community of Democracies Ministerial (Ref A) to MFA's 
Multilateral Affairs Directorate on November 15, 2007.  On 
November 20, Lourdes Puma, MFA Director General of 
Multilateral Affairs, told us that Ecuador was unable to 
attend the ministerial due to limited resources.  This is 
consistent with our response to an earlier demarche (Ref B).
