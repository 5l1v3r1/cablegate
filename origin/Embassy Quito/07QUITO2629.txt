SUBJECT: SUPPORT FOR GOE NOMINATION TO UNHRC ADVISORY 
COMMITTEE 
 
¶1.  Post wishes to express its strong support of the GOE's 
nomination of Jose VALENCIA Amores to serve as a member of 
the United Nations Human Rights Commission Advisory 
Committee.  Dr. Valencia's experience and temperament would 
be a true asset to the committee. 
 
¶2.  Currently a professor and Coordinator of the 
International Relations Program at the distinguished Latin 
American Faculty for Social Sciences (FLACSO) in Quito, 
Valencia served from 2005 until September 2007 as the 
Executive Director of the NGO Citizen Participation.  During 
his tenure at Citizen Participation, Valencia demonstrated 
unquestionable integrity, overseeing elections monitoring 
results for key nationwide elections.  Respected by all 
political parties as well as the public, Valencia led the 
organization in reviews of government institutions, and never 
shied away from criticizing the GOE when necessary.  His 
calm, evenhanded tone was welcome amidst the charged 
political scene in the run-up to this year's Constitutional 
Assembly elections. 
 
¶3.  Prior to joining Citizen Participation, Valencia held 
numerous positions at the Ecuadorian Ministry of External 
Relations, including tours at the Ecuadorian missions to the 
United Nations in Geneva and New York, where he concentrated 
on human rights topics.  He demonstrated great savvy as Chief 
of Cabinet to the Ecuadorian Minister of Foreign Affairs from 
1997-1998.  Dr. Valencia also has extensive academic 
experience, having taught at FLACSO, the University San 
Francisco de Quito, and Catholic University of Quito.  Dr. 
Valencia's complete curriculum vitae will be forwarded to IO 
under separate cover. 
 
¶4.  The embassy hopes that Dr. Valencia's nomination will be 
given serious consideration and that his candidacy for the 
May election will prove successful.
