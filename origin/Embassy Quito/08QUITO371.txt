DECLARATION 
 
REF: STATE 40380 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) Poloff delivered demarche on the United States - 
European Union declaration on Prisoners of Conscience 
(reftel) and presented draft declaration language to Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs Director General for Human Rights Augusto 
Saa April 24.  Saa said that the Ministry was previously 
unaware of the draft and he would therefore have to consult 
the GOE mission in New York.  However, he added that on first 
glance, the notion of such a  declaration was "consistent 
with the principles of human rights which guide Ecuadorian 
foreign policy."  Saa also noted that the co-sponsorship of 
the resolution by the European Union would make adoption 
easier.  Saa said he would inform post of the GOE's final 
position on the resolution in due course.
