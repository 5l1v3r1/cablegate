¶1. (SBU) On August 9, PolOff met with Lourdes Puma Puma, MFA 
Director General of Multilateral Affairs, and delivered 
reftel demarche, including dip note, talking points, and CV 
for Ms. Felice Gaer.  Puma said that the GOE is aware of 
Gaer's run for reelection and approved of her previous 
participation on the committee, but did not express 
commitment to support her candidacy. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Puma asked that the USG support Ecuador,s own 
candidate, Luis Benigno Gallegos Chiriboga.  She explained 
that Ambassador Chiriboga presented his candidacy in March of 
2007 and was well known in the international community from 
having served as the Ambassador to the U.S. since October 
2005 and as Ecuador's UN Permanent Rep during 2002-2005.  She 
said Ecuador is very keen on his election as Ecuador was not 
well represented on UN bodies.
