SUBJECT: CAN LEADERS MEET IN QUITO 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary: Presidents from Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and 
Bolivia met at the Andean Community (CAN) conference in Quito 
on June 13 to publicly demonstrate their commitment to the 
troubled regional organization, discuss areas for cooperation 
with the European Union (EU), and to issue a joint letter 
asking the U.S. to extend trade preferences set to expire

attend.  Palacio and Morales criticized the U.S. for the 
eventual lapse of ATPDEA, calling it their just due for 
cooperating on narcotrafficking issues.  End Summary. 
 
CAN Presidents Meet, Chavez Absent 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Andean Community Presidents Alfredo Palacio, Alvaro 
Uribe, Alejandro Toledo, and Evo Morales met in Quito on June 
13 to reaffirm their nation,s commitment to CAN, agree to 
engage the EU on commercial and development issues as a bloc, 
and to draft a joint letter asking the U.S. to extend trade 
preferences beyond December 2006.  Bolivian President Evo 
Morales, who assumed the presidency from Palacio, presided 
over the event.  Notably absent was Venezuelan President Hugo 
Chavez, who despite invitations from Palacio and Morales, did 
not attend. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Acting Colombian DCM Rodrigo Burgos told PolOff on 
June 14 that the principal objective of the meeting, in light 
of Venezuela,s decision to leave CAN, was to publicly 
demonstrate their nation,s commitment to the organization. 
He said that the meeting was positive overall, and should 
help the organization move beyond recent controversies. 
Burgos confessed that there was considerable concern and 
debate over how the U.S. would react to the joint letter, and 
confirmed reports of tension between Toledo and Morales.  He 
said that Colombia will not likely pass the FTA before 
January or February 2007, and would benefit from extension. 
 
ATPDEA is Our Right! 
-------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Bolivian President Evo Morales reportedly said that 
Andean countries had assumed responsible roles in the fight 
against narcotrafficking, and that the U.S. should not use 
ATPDEA as a form of political control nor to force their 
governments to privatize natural resources.  Palacio weighed 
in, reportedly calling the trade preferences Ecuador,s 
"moral, economic, and social" right for their efforts against 
narcotraffickering, and reissued his plea for the U.S. to 
return to free trade talks. 
 
Joint Declaration 
----------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) CAN Presidents issued a joint declaration affirming 
each country's commitment to regional integration and 
development based on sound democratic and social principles. 
The Quito Declaration also voiced CAN's desire to enter an 
Agreement of Association with the European Union, which would 
include a commercial agreement and grater cooperation on a 
range of unspecified issues.  They reaffirmed CAN,s 
commitment to fight narcotrafficking and terrorism, and to 
address structural causes for migration, poverty, and social 
exclusion, among other tings. 
 
¶6.  (U) CAN leaders also drafted and signed a letter asking 
for the renewal of ATPDEA trade preferences for the region, 
which Colombian President Uribe reportedly presented to 
President Bush today in Washington.  The letter stresses the 
importance of the U.S. market to CAN countries and asked that 
it be extended until Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador conclude 
free trade agreements (or ratification) with the US.  Toledo, 
who expects that the FTA will pass the Peruvian Congress 
soon, declined to be included in the petition, choosing 
instead to note Peruvian solidarity for the measure.
