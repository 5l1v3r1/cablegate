SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST DETAINED BY MILITARY 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary:  Human Rights activist Wilman Adolfo Jimenez 
Salazar was detained by the military on June 19 in Payamino, 
Orellana province.  He is charged with violating the state of 
emergency and was held incommunicado until June 26.  Amnesty 
International considers Jimenez to be a prisoner of 
conscience.  Ecuadorian human rights activists fear future 
mistreatment and a civil court has requested jurisdiction 
from the military to try the case.  Provincial leaders are 
striking for Jimenez's release and the lifting of the state 
of emergency.  Defense Minister Oswaldo Jarrin defended the 
detention as justified under the state of emergency declared 
in Orellana province since March.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Wilman Jimenez Salazar, a member of the Orellana 
Human Rights Committee, was arrested in Payamino near Coca, 
the provincial capitol of Orellana province, on June 19 while 
protesting with peasant communities from Payamino and taking 
photos to document any police abuses.  He is accused of 
throwing rocks at police, though human rights activists deny 
this.  Police and military used tear gas and rubber bullets 
to break up the demonstration.  During the protest Jimenez 
reportedly received six rubber bullet wounds and another man 
was also injured. 
 
¶3.  (U) After his arrest, Jimenez was taken to Coca's Public 
Hospital for medical treatment and then to Coca's Judicial 
Police Station.  Human rights activists went to the police 
station on June 19 and were given Jimenez's camera and 
personal belongings.  When they returned the next day they 
were told that he had been transferred to a military brigade 
in Pastaza province.  The same day, a habeas corpus writ was 
filed on his behalf and granted by the civil court but 
rejected by the military, which has jurisdiction under the 
state of emergency decree.  Until June 26, no one was allowed 
to visit Jimenez despite the Sucumbios District Attorney's 
order of a medical examination on June 21. 
 
¶4.  (U) After an urgent action appeal sent by Amnesty 
International, Jimenez was allowed to see family and his 
lawyer on June 26.  He is being attended to by a military 
doctor, according to human rights contacts.  Once access was 
granted to his lawyer, Jimenez did not allege torture or 
mistreatment but the military will not permit an outside 
doctor to assess his condition according to human rights 
contacts.  A civil court submitted a request to try the case 
and Gonzalo Mesa, commander of the fourth army division in 
the region, said that he would answer within two weeks.  In 
the meantime Jimenez will be held in a military facility. 
 
¶5.  (U) David Cordero of the Ecumenical Commission on Human 
Rights (CEDHU) told us on June 30 that public opinion may 
pressure the military to hand the case over to a civil court. 
 Cordero worried that a military trial would not be impartial 
and that torture could occur during further interrogation. 
Jimenez, a civilian, can be tried by a military court under 
Ecuador's National Security Law.  Cordero stated that 
although the protest took place within the oil installations, 
reports of violence were exaggerated by authorities to 
justify their actions.  He claimed that no damage had 
occurred to property. 
 
¶6.  (U) A moving strike led by the Mayor of Coca and the 
Prefect (US governor-equivalent) of Orellana province began 
on June 28 and has continued for two days.  Strikers mounted 
mobile roadblocks on rural roads, demanding an end to the 
state of emergency and the release of Jimenez. 
 
¶7.  (U) Minster of Defense General Oswaldo Jarrin defended 
the detention in a June 30 radio interview.  Jimenez had 
violated the emergency decree which limits freedom of 
assembly and suspends habeas corpus.  He said that "in a 
state of emergency, no activist... has the right to use 
violence, to assault, to raid a privately owned oil 
installation."  Jimenez attempted to damage private property 
and will not be released, he said.
