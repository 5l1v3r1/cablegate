Most Excellent President and friend: 
 
I have the honor of addressing Your Excellency with the 
purpose of expressing feelings of deep sympathy and 
solidarity on the part of the Ecuadorian government and 
people regarding the tragedy that the United States, 
particularly the State of Florida, suffered due to Hurricane 
Wilma, a regrettable event that caused the loss of valuable 
human lives and considerable material damage. 
 
I am sure that the bravery of the noble American people and 
the invaluable assistance given immediately to the victims of 
this natural phenomenon by your illustrious government will 
allow a quick overcoming of this adversity. 
 
I reiterate to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest 
and most distinguished consideration. 
 
Alfredo Palacio G. 
JEWELL
