SUBJECT: UN HEALTH RAPPORTEUR SIDES WITH GOE ON SPRAYING 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: United Nations Rapporteur for Human Health 
Rights Paul Hunt visited Ecuador May 14-18 at the invitation 
of the GOE to conduct a "non-scientific" study of the impact 
of Colombia's aerial fumigation program on Ecuadorian 
residents in the border region.  Hunt met with residents, NGO 
representatives, and local officials in three small 
communities in the Sucumbios province, and discussed 
development and health issues with GOE officials including FM 
Espinosa.  Before departing he told the press that the GOC 
should permanently end spraying of glyphosate due to credible 
evidence that aerial fumigations had negatively impacted the 
physical and mental health of border residents.  He also 
expressed concern over the poor state of healthcare in 
Ecuador's border region.  Hunt is expected to deliver a 
formal report to the UN Human Rights Council sometime this 
summer.  Foreign Minister Maria Espinosa touted Hunt's 
comments as a "victory" for Ecuador, and said she would 
discuss Hunt's preliminary findings with Colombia Foreign 
Minister Fernando Araujo during his May 28 visit to Quito. 
End Summary. 
 
Taking Ecuador's Side 
 
¶2. (U) Hunt told the press on May 18 that there is credible 
evidence to suggest that aerial dissemination of glyphosate 
had negatively impacted the physical and mental health of 
Ecuadorians along the border.  He publicly urged the 
Colombian government not resume aerial fumigations until it 
could clearly prove that glyphosate does not negatively 
impact public health.  Hunt also expressed concern over the 
lack of an adequate healthcare infrastructure and sufficient 
GOE presence in the border region.  He is expected to deliver 
his full report to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. 
 
UN Rapporteur Explains Mission to Diplomatic Missions 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Earlier on May 18, Hunt briefed interested members 
of the dipcorps about the background to his visit, and hinted 
at his preliminary findings without spelling them out.  Hunt 
explained that his May 14-18 visit was to ensure the basic 
human right to the highest attainable standard of health for 
Ecuador's northern border residents.  He noted that while he 
had reviewed the CICAD study and spoken with representatives 
from the OAS, PAHO, and UNDPC before traveling to Ecuador, 
his research was not scientific.  Hunt also denied that he 
would be the international representative to the tripartite 
commission studying the issue. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Hunt said that he had met during his visit with 
Foreign Minister Maria Espinosa, Minister Coordinator for 
Internal and External Affairs Fernando Bustamante, and MFA 
Director of International Cooperation Ambassador Carlos 
Jativa to discuss conditions in the northern border region 
and the GOE response (namely Plan Ecuador).  Prior to 
announcing his findings to the press, he intended to brief FM 
Espinosa privately. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Hunt recounted meetings in three communities in the 
Sucumbios province where residents, NGO representatives, and 
local residents shared concerns over the negative impact of 
glyphosate on their health, crops, and environment.  Hunt 
expressed shock over Ecuador's "historic neglect" of the 
region, and noted that the lack of government services had 
left residents vulnerable to health problems, likely 
exacerbating the glyphosate issue. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Hunt acknowledged as positive Colombia's increased 
efforts to manually eradicate coca plants, and recognized 
that the issue was complicated by the adverse health effects 
of narco-processing in the region.  He emphasized his mandate 
is exclusively focused on the human right to health and said 
that public policies by governments in the region (read 
Colombia) did not appear to take this human right into proper 
account.  Hunt stressed the importance of dialogue and 
cooperation between Ecuador and Colombia, and lamented 
Colombia's decision not to permit him to visit the Colombian 
side of the border, where spraying took place.  Hunt noted 
the absence of any Colombian government representative at the 
briefing, and said his offer to brief the Colombian 
Ambassador before sharing his findings publicly had been 
refused. 
 
Espinosa Claims Victory; Prepares for Araujo Visit 
 
¶7.  (U) Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Maria Espinosa on May 18 
cited Hunt's comments as representing a "great victory" for 
the GOE's position against aerial fumigation within 10 km of 
the Ecuadorian border.  She said that the GOE was confident 
that the GOC would be open to discuss the results of the 
report, and expressed optimism that the GOC would take 
responsibility for the damage caused by aerial fumigations. 
Espinosa and Colombian Foreign Minister Fernando Araujo are 
expected to discuss the issue during their proposed May 28 
meeting in Quito. 
 
COMMENT 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Hunt's visit and findings are already being touted 
by the GOE as vindication of its position, for domestic 
consumption.  FM Espinosa will undoubtedly seek to press 
Araujo for public concessions on the issue.
