¶1.  The Ambassador and El Salvador's envoy to Ecuador, Rafael 
Alfaro, approached GoE FM Patricio Zuquilanda February 2 to 
promote Fernando Flores's OAS SYG candidacy (Ref B details 
Flores-specific portions of the Ambassador's most-recent call 
on Ecuadorian President Gutierrez).  Employing points similar 
to those of Ref A, they praised the Salvadoran ex-president's 
qualifications, track record, and exuberance.  Zuquilanda 
listened politely but offered no substantive response. 
 
¶2.  In order to measure support for competing OAS SYG 
candidates and thus help us to fine-tune our lobbying, the 
Ambassador later called on Chilean Ambassador to Ecuador 
Nelson Haddad.  Haddad claimed he liked the chances of 
Chile's candidate, GoC Interior Minister Ricardo Insulza.  He 
clammed up when pressed for an explanation, however.  The 
Ambassador will meet with the Mexican envoy February 16 to 
gauge backing for GoM candidate FM Luis Derbez. 
 
¶3.  Insulza visited Quito February 10 in search of Ecuador's 
vote, calling on both Gutierrez and Zuquilanda and meeting 
extensively with the press.  In public remarks, the Chilean 
extolled the close bilateral relations Ecuador and Chile had 
long maintained and his desires to see them strengthened. 
Local media coverage was favorable, although neither 
Gutierrez nor Zuquilanda publicly proclaimed support for the 
Chilean minister's candidacy.  In Panama February 11, Insulza 
reportedly claimed that Gutierrez privately had promised him 
Ecuador's OAS vote. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT:  Although Ecuador appears in Chile's camp, our 
pro-Flores campaign continues.  The Ambassador will engage 
other Central American COMs at a February 16 meeting, seeking 
consensus isthmus support for the Salvadoran SYG candidate. 
A week later, Flores travels to Quito on his own 
self-promotion tour.  Ambassador Alfaro has invited us to 
participate in events honoring his ex-president, which we 
expect will draw high-level GoE attendance and allow us 
another chance to sing Flores's praises.
