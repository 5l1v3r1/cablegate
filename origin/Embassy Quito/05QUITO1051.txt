Â¶1.  On May 5, PolOff relayed talking points to MFA Human 
Rights Officer Carmen Larrea emphasizing the reasons a new 
convention would weaken existing international accords.  On 
May 6, Larrea told PolOff the USG's reasoning made sense and 
that she tentatively agreed with our position.  However, she 
wished to review the text of the resolution providing a 
mandate for the working group before giving a definitive 
answer.  Larrea promised to review the text as soon as it 
became available.
