local market for operational use by the Ecuadorian National 
Police's Judicial Police Airport unit at the International Airport

¶2. Discussion: This vehicle is for operational use by the Judicial 
Police's Quito Airport Unit.  Judicial Police is the Government of 
Ecuador's investigative police arm of the National Police.  The 
DHS/ICE office cooperates closely with this unit. Funding for this 
vehicle comes from the Judicial Police Program.  For the security 
of its personnel and on-going operations, it is highly recommended 
for Judicial Police to use nondescript vehicles that are locally 
common rather than the more conspicuous and distinctive U.S.-made 
vehicles. 
 
 
 
¶3. Recommendation:  For the reasons stated above, we recommend 
approval of this request for a source/origin waiver to permit 
acquisition of this vehicle in Ecuador. 
 
 
 
¶4. Please expedite reply. Thank you.

Section, U.S. Embassy, Quito, Ecuador.
