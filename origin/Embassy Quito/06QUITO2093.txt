SUBJECT: ECUADOR WILL NOT SUPPORT WEDGWOOD FOR THE HRC 
 
REF: SECSTATE 85722 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) On August 18, PolOff met with Lourdes Puma, 
Director General for Multilateral Affairs in the Ecuadorian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to deliver the diplomatic note in 
reftel.  Ms. Puma said the GOE will not support Professor 
Ruth Wedgwood's candidacy for re-election to the HRC.  She 
said recently concluded voting agreements made with certain 
European and African countries precluded GOE support. 
Pressed for details, she would not explain further or reveal 
whom Ecuador will support.  Puma stressed that the GOE was 
not necessarily opposed to Dr. Wedgwood's views and did not 
necessarily believe her to be unqualified, but the GOE's 
other commitments took precedence.
