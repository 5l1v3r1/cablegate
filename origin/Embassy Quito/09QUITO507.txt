1.(U) The Embassy has received the official invitation for

President Rafael Correa.  The text of the circular note 
follows. 
 
(Begin text) 
 
The Directorate General of State Ceremonies and Protocol of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Commerce, and Integration 
presents its compliments to the Diplomatic Missions and to 
the Representatives of International Organizations accredited 
in the Republic of Ecuador and has the honor to inform them 
that on Monday, August 10, 2009, the inauguration ceremonies 
for the Constitutional President, Economist Rafael Correa 
Delgado, will take place. 
 
The Directorate General of State Ceremonies and Protocol of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Commerce, and Integration 
carries out its duty of communicating, through this circular 
note, the invitation from the Government of Ecuador to the 
Heads of the State and Heads of Government from friendly 
countries and to the highest officials of International 
Organizations that have Ecuador as a member, in order to 
attend the Presidential inauguration ceremonies and the 
Bicentennial of Ecuador's First Cry of Independence, or on 
the contrary, to designate Special Missions, of the highest 
level, to join the Ecuadorian Head of State in the previously 
cited celebrations. 
 
Information about different activities and ceremonies that 
have been scheduled, and about protocol, logistics, security, 
and press details related to this celebration will be 
released as soon as possible through the Ministry website 
(www.mmrree.gov.ec). 
 
The invitation letters signed by the President of Ecuador to 
the respective Heads of State and Heads of Government and to 
the Representatives of International Organizations will be 
sent in due course. 
 
The rule of precedence that will be applied to the foreign 
delegations attending these ceremonies will be in accordance 
with the date on which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is 
notified about the official delegation that will attend the 
ceremonies, taking into account the level and rank of the 
person that leads the delegation. 
 
Delegations that are not led by the Heads of State or Heads 
of Government must be accredited through the presentation of 
credentials addressed to the President of Ecuador. 
 
The inauguration ceremonies for the Constitutional President, 
Economist Rafael Correa Delgado, have special significance in 
Ecuador's history as the first President who has been 
reelected in the first round, in elections carried out on 
April 26, by a majority of the Ecuadorian people for a new 
presidential term, and because on August 10 Ecuador 
commemorates the Bicentennial of Ecuador's First Cry of 
Independence. 
 
The Directorate General of State Ceremonies and Protocol of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Commerce, and Integration 
avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the honorable 
Diplomatic Missions and Representatives of International 
Organizations the assurance of its highest consideration. 
Quito, June 22, 2009.
