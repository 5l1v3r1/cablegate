¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Ecuadorian and Colombian government 
officials will meet in Quito on April 24-25 to discuss the 
creation of an integrated development zone along their common 
border.  The idea of the plan, agreed to at December 7, 2005 
bilateral ministerial meetings in Quito, seeks to identify 
and develop joint programs and projects to increase public 
services in the area of health, education, water, and 
transportation, while encouraging licit economic growth and 
better environmental management.  We are hopeful the plan 
could help broaden and smooth relations between the two 
neighbors. End Summary. 
 
December 7 Ministerial Produces Results 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Ecuador and Colombia on April 24-25 will hold 
vice-ministerial talks in Quito to finalize plans for an 
integrated development zone (IDZ) along their common border. 
The plan, first discussed in 2002, had been indefinitely 
delayed by contentious bilateral relations over alleged 
airspace violations by the GOC and the GOE demand that aerial 
spraying of coca crops be suspended within 10 km of the 
shared border.  A December 7, 2005, joint declaration by FMs 
Carrion and Barco reinitiated bilateral dialogue mechanisms. 
 
IDZ Closer to Reality 
--------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Ecuadorian and Colombian government representatives 
met on January 26 in Tulcan, Carchi province, to discuss the 
previously stalled IDZ and to outline parameters for their 
engagement.  The bi-national committee agreed that the IDZ 
should promote greater social and economic development along 
the troubled border region.  Under the proposed social 
program, the IDZ would promote investment in health, 
education, water, and transportation.  On the economic front, 
representatives agreed that the IDZ should promote licit 
economic activity and growth in the region. 
 
¶4.  (U) The proposed IDZ spans the entire 400-mile border 
zone, and aims to improve the lives of over 2 million 
Ecuadorians and Colombians living in the area.  The proposal 
is divided into three distinct regions-)Pacific, Andean, and 
Amazon, and includes 21 Ecuadorian and 31 Colombian 
municipalities.  The proposed IDZ also aims to enhance 
environmental and resource management efforts in the region, 
with provisions for the creation of cross-border disaster 
planning mechanisms. 
 
MFA Optimistic About Plan 
------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) MFA Director General for Border Development Amb. 
Claudio Cevallos told PolOff that the GOE was optimistic 
about the plan, believing it to be a positive step towards 
addressing dire border conditions.  Project proposals were 
selected with considerable input from local residents and 
public officials, he said, adding that grass-root acceptance 
and engagement is crucial for the IDZ,s success.  The IDZ, 
according to Cevallos, would also promote greater 
communication and coordination between relevant local, 
provincial, and federal government entities, and would be 
coordinated through the GOE,s Northern Border Development 
Unit (UDENOR).  He said concerns about UDENOR,s ability to 
effectively administer the program would hopefully be 
resolved soon. 
 
International Donors Key 
------------------------ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Cevallos said that Ecuador following the April 
24-25 meeting would seek international donor support for the 
proposed IDZ.  He acknowledge extensive USAID support for 
development projects in the northern border region, but added 
that he hoped the U.S. would provide additional technical and 
financial assistance for the IDZ. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) UNDP Officer Michael Brown said that the UN had 
provided the MFA technical assistance in preparation for 
their bi-national development meetings with Colombia, and 
that he continues to serve as an advisor.  Brown remains 
encouraged by progress made, suggesting that the GOE might be 
more prepared for the April 24-25 meeting than their 
Colombian counterparts.  He again assured us that the 
preliminary UN glyphosate report scheduled to be released to 
the GOE the week of April 24 would urge bi-national 
coordination on health and development issues in the border 
region. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) We are encouraged by the progress made on the IDZ, 
and continue to push for greater cooperation and 
collaboration between the Ecuadorian and Colombian 
governments on cross-border development and security issues. 
We are hopeful that that the preliminary UN glyphosate 
report, scheduled to be released the week of April 24, will 
promote broader discussions on greater investment in these 
areas, rather than the narrow, politicized specific focus on 
glyphosate.  VFM Ribadeneira recently confided to visiting 
WHA/AND Director French that renewed aerial spraying by the 
GOC would "drop a bomb" on the bilateral development agenda 
(RefTel).  We will encourage the GOE to focus instead on the 
potential of a well-planned and executed integrated 
development zone.
