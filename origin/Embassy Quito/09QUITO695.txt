PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT 
 
REF: STATE 70576 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Embassy delivered reftel points to the MFA's 
Directorate of Bilateral Affairs for Europe on July 13 and 
followed up with MFA Bilateral Affairs Director General for 
Europe Pablo Villagomez on July 31, 2009.  Villagomez said 
that he had already received a read-out from the Ecuadorian 
Embassy in Washington, and noted that the GOE regarded the 
meeting as very positive.  He added that Ecuador fully 
supported the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and that a 
Bilateral Presidential Commission's establishment of working 
groups on nuclear energy and arms control would be an 
important move forward.  Villagomez appeared unaware of the 
July 6 bilateral air transit agreement and expressed interest 
in learning more.
