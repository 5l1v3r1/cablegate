 ¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered RefTel points on September 12 to 
MFA Director for Multilateral Affairs, Miguel Mendez, 
communicating USG openness to international opinions on the 
UN High Level Event Outcome Document, while encouraging GOE 
officials to be flexible during negotiations.  Mendez said 
that the GOE is committed to working with the international 
community to develop a viable Outcome Document, but argued 
that the USG should demonstrate a greater willingness to hear 
and consider views of Latin American and other developing 
nations.  Mendez also expressed frustration over what the GOE 
considers the USG tendency to make last-minute changes that 
force "top-down decision-making." PolOff emphasized that the 
USG is negotiation in good faith, and is committed to finding 
strong, appropriate language to ensure successful UN reform. 
The GOE hopes to make the UN a more equitable, transparent 
organization. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: We are skeptical that the GOE will be an 
ally in the Outcome Document negotiations.  End Comment.
