¶1. (SBU) The GOE does not maintain a National List of banned 
terrorist entities. Ecuador,s Superintendency of Banks 
relies on the USG Specially Designated Global Terrorist List 
and the OFAC website in executing terrorist financing 
oversight and remaining compliant with their United Nations 
obligations. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  Post notes that, in general, the GOE is 
relatively cooperative and responsive to any requests made by 
the U.S. Mission with respect to terrorism issues. End 
Comment.
