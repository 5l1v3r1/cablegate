SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  ANDEAN FREE TRADE 
AGREEMENT; VENEZUELA; KYOTO PROTOCOL 
 
¶1.  "Peru's Decision on the FTA," an editorial 
(12/10) in Quito's leading centrist "El Comercio" 
(circ. 70,000) 
 
Quote:  " . . . let's hope that Peru's decision and 
the upcoming Colombian one serve as an alert as to 
the huge risk [involved] in being left on the margins 
of neighbors that accept [free trade] negotiations in 
the end." 
 
¶2.  "Partners Go to the South," a column (12/10) by 
Grace Jaramillo in Quito's leading centrist "El 
Comercio" (circ. 70,000) 
 
Quote:  ". . . The Andean community is in disorder 
and the US is not to blame, but rather a Bolivarian, 
President Hugo Chavez. . .  The truth is that Chavez 
is a difficult phenomenon to understand.  His need to 
accumulate geopolitical power (at least at the Latin 
American level) causes him to make sudden shifts of 
direction that lead to unforeseen consequences. . . 
 
"Chavez is tired of dealing with indecisive 
presidents such Palacio, who first make an approach 
and then withdraw . . . In the Andean community, 
there is no one left to play on his side. . ." 
 
¶3.  "Continuity of the Kyoto Protocol," a front page 
editorial (12/02) in Quito's center-left "Hoy" (circ. 
38,500) 
 
Quote:  ". . .Despite US resistance, the resolution 
that came out of this meeting [the UN Summit on 
Climate Change in Montreal] represents a step forward 
because it maintains the international commitment to 
reduce emissions of green house gases that cause 
global warming ... The agreement to continue down the 
path set by the Kyoto Protocol is a positive step for 
the entire world."
