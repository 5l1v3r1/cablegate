MOG and MFA Committed to Fighting TIP 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On June 2, PolChief delivered reftel talking points and 
suggested action items to MOG advisor Darwin Delgado and TIP 
POC.  Delgado said his office is analyzing the TIP law 
Congress passed on June 1, and will meet with women's groups 
before deciding whether to recommend the President sign the 
law.  PolChief expressed the urgency of implementation of the 
law to make arrests within the next 60 days. 
 
¶3.  PolChief and PolOff discussed the TIP report with the MFA 
Human Rights Director Carmen Larrea on June 2.  Larrea 
expressed concern about trafficking and the consequences of a 
Tier 3 designation.  Larrea said she was a personal friend of 
Minister of Government Mauricio Gandara and would urge the 
MOG for anti-TIP actions.  PolOff emphasized the need for 
significant law enforcement actions using the new legislation 
within 60 days and explained the need for progress on various 
fronts elaborated in the action plan. 
 
¶4.  Comment:  MOG and MFA officials, and President Palacio 
himself (ref B), have uniformly expressed understanding of 
the Tier III designation and commitment to make progress in 
the near future.  Our immediate goal is to ensure the GOE 
carries out law enforcement actions using the law, and helps 
victims.  We will work closely with the GOE and other key 
players to encourage progress over the next 60 days.  With 
many other priorities competing for the new government's 
attention, the road ahead will be challenging.
