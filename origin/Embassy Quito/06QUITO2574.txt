REF: A. SECSTATE 169257 
     ¶B. QUITO 1386 
 
¶1.  (SBU) PolOff presented Ref A points and non-papers to 
Augusto Saa, Director of Human Rights and Social and 
Environmental issues at the MFA, on October 12, emphasizing 
the USG view that the Chair's draft UN Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples is fundamentally flawed. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Saa responded that the GOE continues to support the 
draft Declaration, but has advised its UN mission not to push 
any sensitive issues and would share USG concerns regarding 
the declaration with them.  He agreed that more discussion of 
the declaration would be necessary before a final vote, and 
said Ecuador would consult with others who are in favor while 
remaining open to arguments from those who oppose it.  Saa 
emphasized it would be difficult for Ecuador to actively 
oppose the draft, citing political realities here, including 
the current electoral climate and the support for the 
Declaration from Ecuadorian indigenous groups.
