¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  A day after President Correa announced 
that Ecuador cut diplomatic relations with Colombia, the 
Constituent Assembly suspended its normal business to discuss 
the Colombian incursion.  The Assembly is expected to adopt a 
resolution condemning the Colombian incursion.  The text is 
also expected to rebuke the United States for allegedly 
assisting Colombia in the operation.  Amidst much nationalist 
rhetoric in favor of Correa's position of protesting the 
violation of Ecuadorian sovereignty, some opposition members 
of the Assembly and other commentators called for the GOE to 
focus on expelling the FARC, and others called for an 
investigation into the Colombian accusations of GOE ties with 
the FARC.  End Summary. 
¶2.  (SBU) With President Correa traveling in the region and 
FM Salvador at the OAS on March 4, attention shifted to the 
Constituent Assembly.  The Constituent Assembly put aside its 
constitutional drafting on March 4 to discuss the Colombian 
incursion, and has announced that it would adopt a resolution 
criticizing the GOC.  Minister of Internal and External 
Security Gustavo Larrea visited the Assembly the morning of 
March 4 to explain the details of the incursion, which 
included charts and lasted over two hours. 
 
¶3.  (C) According to a statement by Cesar Rodriguez, 
President of the legislative committee, the resolution will 
include two main components: an exhortation to Latin American 
countries and to the world to respect peace, and a 
repudiation of the violation of national sovereignty. 
Patriotic Society Party (PSP) Assembly member Fausto Lupero 
told us that the resolution also includes language critical 
of U.S. assistance to the Colombian military operation. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Alberto Acosta, President of the Assembly, appeared 
to express the opinion of the majority of Assembly members. 
He called the Colombian action "unacceptable" but added that 
this is also true of the presence of any "irregular force" in 
Ecuador.  Proud and Sovereign Fatherland (PAIS) bloc members 
backed the GOE's statement denying any inappropriate ties 
between the Executive branch and the FARC. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The opposition blocs demanded further explanation 
of interaction between the GOE and the FARC.  Galo Lara of 
the PSP questioned, "How can the Assembly say no to an 
American base (sic) but have armed insurgents sleep in their 
pajamas in Ecuador as if it were their home?"  Cesar Rohon of 
the Social Christian Party (PSC) and Mae Montano of the New 
Option movement (UNO) insisted that the Colombian accusations 
warrant investigation and that the GOE not only direct its 
criticism at the Colombian military but also at the FARC. 
Rafael Esteves, ex-PSP member, provided a letter to Acosta 
requesting the replacement of Minister of Defense, Wellington 
Sandoval, declaring that "Intelligence and the Armed Forces 
should have known about and provided a warning about the 
presence of the FARC." 
 
¶6.  (SBU) During the Assembly discussion, members also 
questioned the U.S. role in the Colombian military operation. 
 Eduardo Zambrano asked why "information supplied via 
satellite is used for an attack on Ecuadorian soil, but can't 
be used to locate and eradicate coca fields," and said that 
it is time to rid Ecuador of the presence of foreign troops 
at Manta.  Pedro de la Cruz was among those calling for an 
investigation of the U.S. "base" in Manta. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Before departing Ecuador, President Correa spoke in 
a national broadcast on the evening of March 3 to explain to 
the Ecuadorian people why the GOE had cut diplomatic 
relations with Colombian and to calm concerns about travel 
between the two countries.  He asserted that the incursion 
occurred at a time when the GOE was negotiating the released 
of FARC-held hostages, and that Uribe was aware of this. 
Minister Larrea called Colombian accusations about FARC links 
a "smoke screen" attempt by the GOC to divert attention from 
its incursion into Ecuadorian sovereignty. 
 
¶8.  (U) A poll taken on March 3 in Ecuador by Cedatos Gallup 
International and the National Consulting Center of Colombia, 
showed that 80 percent of respondents support President 
Correa's position, when asked about the incursion, the 
resulting deaths of Reyes and other FARC members, as well as 
Correa's protest regarding the lack of respect to Ecuadorian 
sovereignty.
