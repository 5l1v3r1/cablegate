SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR SOURCE/ORIGIN WAIVER: PROCUREMENT OF VEHICLE FOR 
DINAPEN POLICE UNIT 
 
¶1.  Issue: Post requests a source origin waiver from geographic 
code 000 (United States only) to geographic code 935 (special free 
world) to permit the procurement of one vehicle in the host country 
local market for operational use by the National Police's DINAPEN 
unit, an anti-trafficking and human smuggling police unit.

¶2. Discussion: This vehicle will be used by the Ecuadorian national 
police's DINAPEN unit, Ecuador's primary trafficking in persons and 
human smuggling police unit, for victim rescue and victim 
transportation. The DHS/ICE office cooperates and collaborates 
closely with the DINAPEN police unit. INL provided funding for 
trafficking in persons in 2007 based on post's request to equip and 
support a vastly under-equipped Ecuadorian police unit. This 
vehicle was included on this request and is part of a larger 
equipment purchase to increase the Ecuadorian government's 
capabilities to fight trafficking in persons and human smuggling 
organizations in Ecuador. 
 
 
 
¶3. Recommendation:  We recommend approval of this request for a 
source/origin waiver to permit acquisition of this project vehicle 
in Ecuador. 
 
 
 
¶4. Please expedite reply. Thank you.

Section, U.S. Embassy, Quito, Ecuador.
