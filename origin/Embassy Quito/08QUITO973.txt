REF: STATE 90321 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post confirms completion of a pre-license check on 
licenses 050117804, 050117818, 050117829 and 050117848 for 
the export of automatic weapons and grenade launchers to 
Ecuador.  Post also confirms that the end-user, Armada del 
Ecuador, has legitimately ordered the defense articles listed 
in reftel, to be purchased from MLM International Corp 
through consignee MG Suber and Associates. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In establishing the bona fides of the purchase 
request, Post spoke with Fabian Jarrin Moreno, Commander of 
the Ecuadorian Marines Corps and the end user certification 
official for the Ecuadorian Armed Forces.  Moreno confirmed 
that the orders for the firearms listed on the license 
applications in reftel were legitimate.  He noted that the 
GOE is purchasing this large quantity of firearms and grenade 
launchers to equip the increased number of military personnel 
in the Northern Border region, specifically in the areas of 
General Farfan and various posts along the Putumayo River of 
Sucumbios province, as well as other Ecuadorian Marine Corps 
units in the environs near the cities of San Lorenzo and 
Esmeraldas in Esmeraldas province. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In general, weapons are not being displaced with 
this purchase.  Rather, the purchase represents an increase 
in equipment to support the Ecuadorian military's operations 
in the Northern Border region. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post further notes that this transaction supports 
our theater security cooperation strategy and is in the USG's 
interests in the region.  Post recommends approval of this 
purchase.
