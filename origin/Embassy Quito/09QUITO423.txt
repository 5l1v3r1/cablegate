¶1.  (SBU) On June 5, EconOff delivered reftel points to Ambassador 
Lourdes Puma, Director General for Multilateral Affairs in the 
Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry.  The Embassy sent the MFA a hard copy 
of the points on May 19, but we have been unable to have a meeting 
until now due to travel by our GOE interlocutors.  Puma stated that 
Ecuador's positions on North Korea were well-known and unchanging. 
She said that Ecuador strongly supported non-proliferation efforts, 
but wanted to see them linked to nuclear disarmament efforts by all 
countries. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Puma was receptive to EconOff's message about the 
importance of taking appropriate action against the DPRK entities 
listed in reftel.  She said that Ecuador only honored designations 
that came from the UN Security Council, as opposed to "unilateral" 
designations.  Puma did not appear to be familiar with either the 
UNSC resolutions or the DPRK entities detailed in the talking 
points. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post has also provided a letter and a copy of the 
background information to the GOE Superintendency of Banks.
