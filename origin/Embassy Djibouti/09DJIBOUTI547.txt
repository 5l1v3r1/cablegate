SUBJECT: Djibouti Supports Launch of Somali Independent News Agency 
 
¶1.    (U) SUMMARY: The Somali Independent News Agency (SOMINA) 
was officially launched in Djibouti on April 30 by the Djiboutian 
Minister of Communication and Culture, Ali Abdi Farah.  In close 
coordination with Reporters Without Borders (RWB) and funded by the 
Doha Center for Media Freedom, established by the Emir of Qatar, 
SOMINA is headquartered in Djibouti and employs nine correspondents 
based in major urban centers throughout Somalia.  Because SOMINA's 
charter and license with the GODJ prohibits broadcasting within 
Djibouti, SOMINA's reporting operations will be web-based and 
focused only on Somalia-related issues.  SOMINA's stated mission is 
to provide fair, balanced, accurate, and objective reporting on 
Somalia issues, focused on state-building, peace and stability, 
human rights, and humanitarian assistance related news. 
 
¶2.    (U) PAO spoke with Omar Faruk Osman, the driving force 
behind the establishment of SOMINA.  A reporter-in-exile from 
Mogadishu, Faruk is politically very active in the region and 
serves as the Secretary-General of both the National Union of 
Somali Journalists (NUSOJ) and the East Africa Journalists 
Association (EAJA), which is based in Djibouti.  Working with 
Robert Menard, one of the founders and the former Secretary-General 
of RWB and the current Director-General for the Doha Center for 
Media Freedom, Faruk secured $120,000 from the Doha Center to start 
SOMINA.  The six-person Board of Directors is comprised of three 
members of RWB (including the current Secretary-General), two 
members of NUSOJ (including Faruk), and the Africa Desk Officer for 
the Doha Center for Media Freedom.  The Doha Center has only agreed 
to fund SOMINA for one year; however, the Dutch governmental agency 
that supports independent media operations, Press Now, has agreed 
to three additional years of financial support pending evaluation 
of effectiveness. 
 
¶3.    (U) SOMINA reporting can be read at www.sominaonline.com 
or received via email at info@sominaonline.com. 
 
¶4.    (U) COMMENT: Djibouti already hosts nearly two dozen Somali 
journalists, many of whom write for web-based publications or other 
Somali news agencies.  The opening of SOMINA underscores the 
opportunity to use Djibouti-based Somali journalists as part of 
U.S., U.N, and/or AMISOM public diplomacy and strategic 
communications programs aimed at Somalis.  END COMMENT.
