Ambassador briefed Djibouti's Acting Foreign Minister Ahmed Ali 
Silay on the Sudan strategy released by the Department Oct. 19 
(reftel), and provided a copy of the publication " Sudan:  A 
Critical Moment, A Comprehensive Approach."   The Minister and his 
staff took careful note of the points and expressed support for USG 
goals of ending conflict in Darfur, implementing the CPA, and 
ensuring that Sudan does not become a haven for terrorists.  To 
this end, they welcomed USG engagement with Khartoum, and use of 
incentives and disincentives to ensure progress.
