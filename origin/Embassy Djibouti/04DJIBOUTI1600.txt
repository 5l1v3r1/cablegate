SUBJECT: 2005 NTE ON THE ARAB LEAGUE - DJIBOUTI 
 
REF: STATE 262883 
 
¶1. (U) Post's 2004 report on the subject remains valid. 
Djibouti does not currently enforce any aspect of the 
boycott against the state of Israel. Israel's import code 
has not been removed from the local import codification 
manual and remains 624; however, there is little to no 
direct trade. 
 
¶2. (U) Djibouti's 2005 presidential elections are unlikely 
to bring any changes to the enforcement of the boycott.  As 
part of its foreign policy, Djibouti continues to be a 
fervent supporter of the Palestinian cause and does not 
hesitate to echo Arab condemnation of U.S. policy towards 
Israel and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
