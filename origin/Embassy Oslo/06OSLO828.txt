SUBJECT: INVITATION DELIVERED-AFGHANISTAN PROVINCIAL 
RECONSTRUCTION TEAM (PRT) CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 102464 
 
Â¶1.  (U)  On June 26 we delivered the PRT Conference 
invitation to Anita Nergaard, Director in the MFA's Global 
Security Section. We were joined by Lisa Stadelbauer, 
Canadian Counselor for Political Affairs.  Nergaard thanked 
us for the invitation and noted that she would forward the 
information to hear colleagues in the Development Ministry. 
She emphasized Norway's eagerness "to do more on the 
reconstruction side" in Norway's Afghanistan PRT.  After 
reviewing the draft conference schedule (and suggested 
seminar points), she did not foresee problems with the 
suggested Norwegian speaking topic, as outlined in the draft 
conference agenda.  We also delivered the invitation to Keith 
Elkenes, Adviser at the Ministry of Defense.  Elkenes was 
very receptive to the invitation, and noted that he would 
carefully review the suggested themes for the Norwegian 
speaking session.
