¶1.  We delivered reftel demarche to MFA Global Security 
Section advisor Torn Dramdal.  Dramdal was pleased to receive 
our request and promised that Norway would carefully consider 
providing police instructors to the Jordan International 
Police Training Center (JIPTC). 
 
¶2.  Comment:  In its October 2005 coalition declaration, the 
new Norwegian government specifically stated that it would 
consider out-of-country police training for Iraqi police. 
Reftel's request for JIPTC trainers may help Norway fulfill 
this aspiration and elicit a positive Norwegian response.
