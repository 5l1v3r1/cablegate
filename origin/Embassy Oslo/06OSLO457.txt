Classified By: Pol/Econ Counselor Mike Hammer, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
 1.(C) On April 7 we delivered reftel points to Narve 
Solheim, Adviser in the MFA's UN Section.  Solheim expressed 
Norway's regrets that the U.S. would not presently seek a 
seat on the UN Human Rights Council, and urged that the U.S. 
consider running in the future.  Solheim took the opportunity 
to advocate for U.S. support in Finland's candidacy as a 
Council member, which has not yet been made public. 
According to Solheim, Finland's candidacy will likely be 
announced (and supported) through a demarche issued jointly 
by all Nordic countries.
