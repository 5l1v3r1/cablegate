Â¶1. (U) Norwegian MFA Security Policy and Afghan experts agree 
that ISAF should have a greater role in counter narcotics. 
As part of a broader discussion on Afghan issues the 
Norwegians expressed support for greater ISAF involvement in 
counter narcotics before poloff made demarche points.  Norway 
has remained silent in NATO but will consider speaking up to 
urge greater ISAF counter narcotics involvement.  We have 
requested senior level meetings with the head of the MFA 
Security Policy Section to re-emphasize the importance of the 
SACEUR initiative.
