(SBU)  On March 20 we delivered reftel A points to Tormod 
Endresen, Deputy Director General in the MFA's Section for 
Human Rights and Democracy.  While studying the points, he 
noted that Norway fully agreed that international pressure 
against Zimbabwe is appropriate.  Pointing to Norwegian 
concerns regarding the human rights situation in Zimbabwe, he 
stated that local Norwegian Embassy officials visited 
hospitalized opposition members.  Endresen also acknowledged 
our recent delivery of reftel C points, as reported in reftel 
¶B.  The MFA also issued a press release today condemning the 
attacks on Zimbabwe's opposition members.
