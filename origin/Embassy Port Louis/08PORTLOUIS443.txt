On December 16, First Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
Regional Integration and International Trade Martine Young Kim Fat 
called Poloff to say that Mauritius will most likely support the 
U.S. position on Somalia as it was conveyed in the previous demarche 
(reftels).  Young Kim Fat added that this position seems to align 
well with the current African Union position that a security vacuum 
in Somalia is unacceptable.
