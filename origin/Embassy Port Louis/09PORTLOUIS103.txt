¶1. (SBU) On April 6, Post received by fax a diplomatic note dated 
April 2 from the Seychelles' Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) 
stating that the vessel "Indian Ocean Explorer" had been captured 
with a crew of seven Seychellois nationals in Seychelles' 
territorial waters, and was heading toward the Somali coast.  The 
note asked the USG to "intercept and thwart" this act of piracy.  It 
called attention to a similar incident, involving three Seychellois 
nationals captured and detained by Somali pirates, mentioned in a 
previous diplomatic note dated March 27.
