(SBU) On November 4, Poloff delivered reftel points to 
Martine S.C. Young Kim Fat, First Secretary at the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and International 
Trade.  Young Kim Fat noted that Mauritius' vote for the 
resolution coming out of the HRC Special Session on October 
15-16 supported its previous positions on Palestine.  Poloff 
noted that Mauritius' position had not changed, but pushed 
back, inquiring if the GOM approved of all the aspects of the 
resolution or if the GOM had any concerns regarding the 
sweeping legal conclusions and recommendations of the report. 
 Poloff specifically addressed the following U.S. concerns 
which may be contained in a resolution for adoption to be 
presented by the Arab Group, the OIC, and others on November 
4 or 5: establishing an International Tribunal, encouraging 
the Security Council to refer allegations to the 
International Criminal Court, and referring matters to the 
International Court of Justice.  While Young Kim Fat made no 
substantive response, she indicated that she had taken 
careful note of U.S. concerns, and said she would be 
forwarding them to her mission in New York with a request 
that they take a close look at the U.S. position.
