REPORT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 106423 
 
(SBU) On October 16, Poloff delivered reftel points to 
Ambassador Patrice Cure, Head of Multilateral Directorate - 
Political, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration 
and International Trade.  Cure told Poloff that he viewed the 
Goldstone Report as a bona-fide report, completed through a 
process.  However, he said that GOM would be willing to work 
on more accommodating language, and that he would immediately 
forward the reftel points to his colleagues in New York and 
in Geneva accordingly.
