¶1.  (SBU)  On December 18, poloff delivered REF A non-paper 
and demarche to Lars-Gunnar Wigemark, Head of the Security 
Policy Unit in the External Relations Directorate of the 
European Commission.  Poloff emphasized that as part of our 
engagement with the European Union to deny Iran the means to 
enrich uranium, the USG would like to work with the European 
Commission to secure uranium mines in key African countries 
such as Namibia, Sierra Leone, Niger, Gabon, the DRC, and 
South Africa.  In particular, the U.S. would like to invite 
the Commission to send experts to a mid-January 2010 mine 
security assessment in Namibia. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Wigemark said the Commission would examine the 
proposal and respond formally as soon as possible. 
Commenting that the Commission has been looking to expand its 
non-proliferation activities in Africa under the Instrument 
for Stability (REF B), he promised to communicate with the 
Development Directorate-General and AIDCO, which administers 
the Instrument for Stability. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Wigemark said the Commission is unlikely to have 
sufficient travel funds to support involvement in the January 
assessment.  He suggested that if, in fact, Commission 
officials are unable to participate, the U.S. should provide 
a post-assessment briefing to the Commission delegation in 
Windhoek and to Commission officials in Brussels.  He said 
such a briefing would allow the EU to make an informed 
decision about providing funding.  Wigemark noted that while 
a funding decision would be made in Brussels, Commission 
delegations in Africa have considerable influence over 
development project decisions in African countries.
