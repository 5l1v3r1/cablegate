GAZA 
 
REF: STATE 135559 
 
¶1. (U) The European Commission allocated 3 million euros from 
its general humanitarian budget on January 4 in response to 
the current crisis in Gaza.  Total 2009 Commission funding 
for Gaza and the West Bank is 290 million euros, which 
includes 55 million from the European Commission Humanitarian 
Aid Office (ECHO) and 235 million from the Directorate 
General for External Relations (RELEX). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Political/Refugee Officer delivered reftel points 
January 6 to Andrea Koulaimah, Deputy Head of Unit for the 
Middle East at ECHO, and Andrea Fontana, Desk Officer for the 
Palestinian Territories at RELEX.  Koulaimah said ECHO had 
programmed 52 million euros for Gaza and the West Bank for 
2009, and increased that amount by 3 million euros this week 
in response to the humanitarian crisis.  Approximately 2 
million of the 3 million euros will go to the UN for its 
flash appeal and the remaining 1 million will go to NGOs 
providing emergency assistance.  Programming of the original 
52 million has not yet been finalized, but should be 
allocated by early February to a combination of international 
organizations and NGOs, she said. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Fontana said the RELEX funding of 235 million euros 
is earmarked for fuel delivery and paying salaries of 
Palestinian Authority officials.  He said RELEX is currently 
having difficulties delivering fuel to Gaza and is putting 
its efforts into securing a cease-fire on both sides. 
Neither RELEX nor ECHO has any plans currently to allocate 
additional funds beyond the 290 million euro earmarked for 
¶2009.
