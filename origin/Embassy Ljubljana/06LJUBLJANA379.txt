¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel points 13 June to Bojana 
Cipot at the Slovene MFA's Department for International 
Organizations.  Cipot noted that Slovenia's representative 
has commented that the atmosphere in Geneva in the runup to 
the Conference is "not positive" and that "political will is 
weak" to reach a consensus because of the large differences 
between the Israeli and Palestinian sides. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Cipot said Slovenia supports the Swiss proposal for 
the Third Additional Protocol.  She also said that Slovenia 
views the U.S. position as positive and opined that Slovenia 
hopes to see "good results" from the Conference.  Cipot 
further noted that Slovenia did not support a proposal from 
"a few countries" to postpone the Conference, indicating that 
Slovenia's position was that this would be counterproductive.
