Â¶1.  Polecon Chief discussed reftel points with OSCE Task 
Force member Alesa Sovinc on August 9.  Sovinc said the 
Government of Slovenia was interested in ensuring the success 
of election monitoring in Afghanistan.  However, it does not 
have extra funds to donate towards the effort.  As Chairman 
in Office of the OSCE, Sovinc said the Slovene Mission was 
working hard in Vienna to identify other sources of funding 
to make up the EUR 360,000 shortfall. A follow-up call from 
Polecon Chief on August 12 confirmed the GOS would be unable 
to supplement this funding gap.
