¶2. (SBU) On July 26, Post received an urgent request from the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs seeking USG assistance in evacuating 
approximately 200 Vietnamese citizens from Lebanon (full text of 
request in paragraph 5).  According to the MFA, most of these 
individuals are staying in Lebanese friends' homes or are "hiding in 
the mountains."  According to press reports, the GVN has made 
similar requests of 11 other nations, including the UK, Canada and 
Germany. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post recognizes that ongoing evacuation operations remain 
focused on Amcits and other priorities.  However, any assistance the 
USG can render to Vietnam would be welcomed here as a significant 
humanitarian gesture and a strong sign of our developing 
partnership. 
 
¶4. (U) Action Request:  Department is requested to advise what 
assistance, if any, the USG can provide.

No. 555/LS/NN 
 
The Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam presents its compliments to the 
Embassy of the United States of America in Vietnam and has the honor 
to request as follows: 
 
Currently in Lebanon there are still about 200 Vietnamese citizens 
who have not been able to evacuate.  As Vietnam does not have any 
diplomatic mission or consular post based in Lebanon, the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam would like to request the relevant 
agencies of the United States of America to help arrange evacuation 
of the above-mentioned Vietnamese citizens from Lebanon. 
 
The U.S. side is requested to provide relevant information on the 
evacuation to the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of Vietnam or the Vietnamese Embassies in Egypt or Turkey 
(contact information attached). 
 
The Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs looks 
forward to receiving an early response of the Embassy on the 
above-mentioned request. 
 
The Consular Department of Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam avails itself of this opportunity to 
renew to the Embassy of the United States of America the assurances 
of its highest consideration.
