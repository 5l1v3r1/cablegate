REF: STATE 134229 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On December 30, Deputy PolCouns met with Ngo Thi Xuan Ha 
of the MFA's International Organizations Division to urge Vietnam to 
support the U.S.-sponsored resolution authorizing a peacekeeping 
operation for Somalia.  Building on an earlier conversation between 
the Ambassador and VFM Pham Binh Minh, DPolCouns stressed, per 
reftel, that failure to authorize the PKO would leave a dangerous 
security vacuum, undo much of the political progress achieved in 
recent months, and have serious negative consequences for the 
humanitarian situation.  He emphasized that the current draft 
accommodates the concerns of the Secretary General and P5 members 
France, England, and Russia, which had earlier voiced reservations. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ms. Ha promised to pass along the substance of the 
demarche, along with the resolution's text, to her superiors.  She 
affirmed that Vietnam strongly supports the peace process in 
Somalia, including proposals by the Secretary General to strengthen 
AMISOM and "re-hat" it under the UN.  At the same time, Ha said that 
the situation in Somalia is "delicate," particularly with the 
December 29 resignation of the President of Somalia's Transitional 
Federal Government.  In determining whether to support the 
U.S.-sponsored UNISOM resolution in its current form, Vietnam must 
consider whether the specific terms of the resolution best support 
the Secretary General's aims.
