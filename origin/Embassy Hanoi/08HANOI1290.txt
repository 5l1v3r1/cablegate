REF: STATE 123081 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In a November 24 conversation with MFA IO Division Head 
Pham Hai Anh Deputy PolCouns expressed U.S. concern over the 
disproportionate number of unhelpful and biased resolutions 
criticizing Israel under consideration at the UN General Assembly. 
Per reftel, DPolCouns urged Vietnam, as a member of the Non-Aligned 
Movement, to use its influence to reduce the number of such 
resolutions and, in particular, not to support the three resolutions 
reaffirming the "Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights 
of the Palestinian People," the "Division for Palestinian Rights 
within the UN Secretariat," and the "Special Committee to 
Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the 
Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories." 
Noting that Vietnam had supported similar resolutions in the past, 
DPolCouns urged Vietnam's UN Mission to at least abstain or not be 
present. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Anh promised to pass along the substance of the demarche 
to the MFA leadership.  Anh said that having just returned from a 
tour at Vietnam's UN Mission, he was well aware of the issue's 
importance to the United States.  Regardless of Vietnam's position 
on the UNGA resolutions, which Anh conceded, as a personal opinion, 
were disproportionate in number, Vietnam shared U.S. aspirations for 
a two-state solution with Israel and Palestine living side by side 
in peace and security.  Anh said that he was not prepared to comment 
on the three specific resolutions, but would raise the issue with 
his superiors.
