REF: STATE 129978 
 
(SBU) In a December 16 discussion with the MFA's IO Division, Deputy 
PolCouns delivered reftel points, emphasizing strong U.S. support 
for the UN International Independent Investigation Commission 
UNIIIC), Commissioner Bellemare, and the Special Tribunal for 
Lebanon (STL).  Per reftel, DPolCouns urged Vietnam to support a 
two-month extension, until February 28, of UNIIIC's mandate in order 
to ensure a smooth transition to the STL in The Hague.  IO official 
Tran Quang Trung stated that the MFA was aware of the issue, but had 
not reached an official position.  He promised to pass along the 
substance of the demarche to his superiors in the MFA and to 
Vietnam's UN Mission, noting -- as a personal observation -- that 
the request for a two-month extension sounded reasonable.
