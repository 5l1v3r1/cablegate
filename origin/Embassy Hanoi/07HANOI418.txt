SUBJECT: VIETNAM MFA PREPARING REPORT ON IRAN'S COMPLIANCE WITH 
UNSCR 1737 
 
REF: A) STATE 23001; B) STATE 24344 
 
(SBU) On March 2, Poloff met with MFA International Organizations 
Department Desk Officer Dang Quoc Hung to deliver Ref A's points on 
Iran.  Hung said Vietnam "always" supports use of nuclear material 
for peaceful purposes and settlement of disputes through 
negotiation.  He noted that Vietnam has signed several nuclear 
non-proliferation and disarmament treaties and maintains good 
relations with the IAEA.  In response to Poloff's assertion that 
Iran's nuclear program does not seem peaceful and that the IAEA 
report makes clear Iran is not cooperating on several outstanding 
issues, Hung said Vietnam is in the process of preparing its own 
report and would convey our points to his leadership.  Poloff left 
with Hung the Ref B text of Washington's 60-day report on "Efforts 
Toward Implementing UNSCR 1737" for MFA's consideration.
