SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON CUBA EMBARGO RESOLUTION DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 148506 
 
(SBU) On October 26, Poloff met with MFA International Organizations 
Department Desk Officer Phan Ho The Nam to deliver reftel points 
urging the GVN to vote against the UNGA resolution condemning the 
U.S. economic embargo against Cuba.  Nam responded by stating the 
GVN's universal position that trade embargos and similar sanctions 
are not appropriate in light of the harm they cause to general 
populations.  The well-being of any people is "the top priority." 
He added that the GVN also cares about the U.S. concerns and will 
give the U.S. position its utmost consideration.  He noted, however, 
that in past years, the resolution has passed with an overwhelming 
majority and that it would be difficult to act against this majority 
view.  He suggested that the United States attempt to find another 
way to engage with the Cuban government for the sake of the Cuban 
people.
