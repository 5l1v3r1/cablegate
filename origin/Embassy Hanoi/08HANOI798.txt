SUBJECT: VIETNAM UNDECIDED ON DRAFT ZIMBABWE RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 73173 
 
(SBU) On July 9, due to the urgency of the demarche and in the 
absence of the Ambassador, the acting Political Counselor discussed 
reftel points on the draft UNSC resolution on Zimbabwe with MFA 
International Organizations Department Specialist Vu Thu Minh.  Ms. 
Minh indicated that MFA leadership has not finalized its position on 
the issue.  She said that, while the GVN is deeply concerned about 
the violence in Zimbabwe and wants to see it reduced, it is still 
considering whether or not the situation in Zimbabwe is a threat to 
international peace and security.  Ms. Minh added that the GVN needs 
more time to study the resolution and that, "if a vote was taken 
today, she wouldn't know the answer" about how Vietnam would vote. 
In considering an appropriate response to the situation in Zimbabwe, 
Ms. Minh said MFA officials are looking at the timing and type of 
UNSC response to other situations of internal unrest, for example 
Kenya and Thailand, as possible precedents.  She also said the MFA 
has the impression that African regional groupings are not 
supportive of the resolution and suggested that they might be given 
more time to reach a solution.
