SUBJECT:  JIANG ZEMIN VISITS VIETNAM:  FRIENDSHIP 
--        "REAFFIRMED" 
 
REF:  BEIJING 1958 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  CHINESE HEAD OF STATE AND PARTY JIANG 
ZEMIN VISITED VIETNAM FEBRUARY 27 TO MARCH 1 IN HIS FIRST 
FOREIGN TRIP OF THE YEAR AND HIS FIRST TO VIETNAM SINCE 
¶1994.  WHILE THERE WAS NO FORMAL JOINT COMMUNIQU FROM THE 
VISIT, A GVN COMMUNIQU CONDEMNED TERRORISM WHILE ODDLY 
OMITTING A REFERENCE TO "ONE CHINA."  THE VISIT APPARENTLY 
BROKE NO NEW GROUND BUT REAFFIRMED EARLIER AGREEMENTS, 
INCLUDING THE LAND BORDER TREATY, TONKIN GULF AGREEMENT, AND 
D 
THE AGREEMENT ON FISHERIES COOPERATION.  THERE ARE STILL 
"SIGNIFICANT ISSUES" CONCERNING THE GULF OF TONKIN AND 
FISHERIES AGREEMENTS.  WORKING-LEVEL INTER-MINISTERIAL 
MEETINGS TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES "WILL CONTINUE."  THE MFA 
DISMISSED REPORTS OF DISSENT OVER THE LAND BORDER AS 
"OVERBLOWN."    END SUMMARY.

FRIENDLY TALKS

¶2.  (SBU) ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS AND PRC EMBASSY FIRST 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HANOI  00614  01 OF 04  151753Z 
SECRETARY XI HUI, THE TRIP WAS A "GREAT SUCCESS."  MFA CHINA 
 
SIPDIS 
DESK DIRECTOR TRAN DUY HAI SEPARATELY TOLD POLOFF THAT 
PRESIDENT JIANG HAD "FRIENDLY MEETINGS" WITH "ALL THE TOP 
LEADERSHIP," INCLUDING CPV GENERAL SECRETARY NONG DUC MANH, 
PRESIDENT TRAN DUC LUONG, PRIME MINISTER PHAM VAN KHAI, AND 
CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY NGUYEN VAN AN.  IN 
ADDITION, HE ALSO MET WITH FORMER GENERAL SECRETARIES OF THE 
CPV CENTRAL COMMITTEE DO MUOI AND LE KHA PHIEU.  HAI SAID 
THE MEETINGS WITH THE FORMER GENERAL SECRETARIES WERE 
ESSENTIALLY "COURTESY CALLS," SINCE JIANG HAD WORKED WITH 
THEM CLOSELY DURING THEIR TENURES AND WANTED TO "PAY HIS 
RESPECTS."  PRC EMBOFF XI SAID THAT THE VISIT HAD 
"REAFFIRMED THE STRONG BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP."  ACCORDING 
TO XI, JIANG FOUND RELATIONS "MUCH BETTER" THAN ON HIS 
PREVIOUS VISIT IN 1994.  DEPUTY MILITARY ATTACHE LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL ZHEN ZHONG XING OF THE PRC EMBASSY, WHO ACCOMPANIED 
JIANG DURING MOST OF THE VISIT, CLAIMED THAT JIANG HAD BEEN 
"GRATIFIED" BY WARM RECEPTION OF THE GVN'S LEADERS AND THE 
PEOPLE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
NO JOINT COMMUNIQUE AND NO MENTION OF ONE CHINA POLICY 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  IN CONTRAST TO THE JOINT DECLARATION THE TWO 
SIDES ISSUED AFTER GENERAL SECRETARY MANH'S NOVEMBER 2001 
VISIT TO THE PRC, THIS TIME THERE WAS ONLY A SINGLE 
COMMUNIQU ISSUED BY VIETNAM'S MFA.  ACCORDING TO PRC EMBOFF 
XI, THE LEADERS HAD AGREED THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ANOTHER 
JOINT DECLARATION SO SOON AFTER THE MANH VISIT.  THE 
INSTITUTE OF CHINA STUDIES' DR. NGUYEN HUY QUY SUGGESTED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HANOI  00614  01 OF 04  151753Z 
THAT, SINCE VIETNAM HOSTED THE VISIT, IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR 
THE HOST MFA TO ISSUE THE COMMUNIQU. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) THE MFA COMMUNIQU FAILED TO REAFFIRM VIETNAM'S 
ONE CHINA POLICY, NOR WAS VIETNAM'S POSITION ON ONE CHINA 
DESCRIBED IN MEDIA ACCOUNTS OF THE VISIT.  ROBERT HSIEH BOR- 
HUEI OF THE TAIPEI ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL OFFICE (TECO) SAID 
THAT FROM TAIWAN'S PERSPECTIVE, THIS WAS "POSITIVE."  PRC 
EMBOFF XI SAID THAT CHINA "KNOWS" THE GVN SUPPORTS THE ONE 
CHINA POLICY AND IS SATISFIED WITH VIETNAM'S "NORMAL 
ECONOMIC RELATIONS" WITH TAIWAN.  DR. QUY STATED THAT THE 
ONE CHINA POLICY HAS BEEN REAFFIRMED "MANY TIMES" IN THE 
PAST.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT VIETNAM HAD NOT WISHED TO HAVE THE 
ONE CHINA POLICY CITED IN THE JOINT COMMUNIQU FOLLOWING 
NONG DUC MANH'S VISIT BUT THAT THE PRC "STRONGLY REQUESTED" 
THAT IT BE INCLUDED.  SINCE THE CHINESE DID NOT REQUEST IT 
THIS TIME, VIETNAM WAS ABLE TO OMIT IT.  THIS ALLOWED 
ED 
VIETNAM TO "BE NICE" TO TAIWAN WITHOUT CONFRONTING THE PRC, 
HE CLAIMED.  THE MFA'S HAI SEPARATELY AFFIRMED THAT THE 
ISSUE OF TAIWAN DID NOT EVEN COME UP DURING THE VISIT.

¶5.  (SBU)  THE GVN'S COMMUNIQU CONDEMNED "ALL FORMS OF 
TERRORISM" AND PLEDGED TO COOPERATE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY IN ANTITERRORISM ACTIVITIES "ON THE BASIS OF THE 
UN CHARTER AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL 
LAW."  ACCORDING TO THE MFA'S HAI, BOTH SIDES ALSO PLEDGED 
TO CONTRIBUTE TO INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO AID THE PEOPLE OF 
AFGHANISTAN.  THE INSTITUTE OF CHINA STUDIES' DR. QUY TOLD 
POLOFF THAT THESE STATEMENTS WERE CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS 
DECLARATIONS CONDEMNING TERRORISM, ESPECIALLY THE EMPHASIS 
ON THE NEED TO "WORK WITHIN AN INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK." 
DR. QUY ADDED THAT VIETNAM HAD CONSISTENTLY SHOWN CONCERN 
FOR THE FATE OF INNOCENT CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT SITUATIONS. 
THIS IS PROBABLY A "LEGACY OF THE AMERICAN WAR," HE OPINED. 
 
--------------------- 
REASONS FOR THE VISIT 
--------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  DR. QUY SAID THE LEADERS DID NOT BREAK NEW GROUND 
ON THIS VISIT; RATHER THEY FOCUSED ON "REAFFIRMING" PREVIOUS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HANOI  00614  02 OF 04  151753Z 
AGREEMENTS AND DECLARATIONS.  HE SUGGESTED SEVERAL REASONS 
FOR THE VISIT AT THIS TIME: 
--  TO RECIPROCATE NONG DUC MANH'S NOVEMBER VISIT AND 
CONTINUE THE SERIES OF HIGH-LEVEL VISITS; 
--  TO CONTINUE THE FOCUS ON INCREASING BILATERAL ECONOMIC 
ACTIVITY.  THE MFA'S HAI POINTED OUT THAT TRADE IN 2001 
REACHED CLOSE TO USD 2.8 BILLION AND THE GOAL IS TO REACH 
USD 3.5 BILLION THIS YEAR AND USD 5 BILLION BY 2005; AND, 
--TO "REAFFIRM" BOTH COUNTRIES' DETERMINATION TO "CONTINUE 
TO RESOLVE REMAINING ISSUES" ON PREVIOUSLY-SIGNED 
AGREEMENTS, SUCH AS THE LAND BORDER TREATY, TONKIN GULF 
AGREEMENT, AND THE AGREEMENT ON FISHERIES COOPERATION. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  SINGAPORE EMBASSY'S FIRST SECRETARY DARRYL LAU 
KAI MUN TOLD POLOFF THERE ARE STILL "SIGNIFICANT ISSUES" 
CONCERNING THE GULF OF TONKIN AND FISHERIES AGREEMENTS. 
THESE CENTER AROUND MARITIME DEMARCATION AND THE NUMBER AND 
SIZE OF FISHING VESSELS ALLOWED IN THE COMMON GROUND. 
COLONEL TRAN NHUNG, DIRECTOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT 
FOR "PEOPLES' ARMY" NEWSPAPER, SAID THAT THE "LARGE NUMBER" 
OF FISHING VESSELS CHINA WANTS TO HAVE IN THE "OVERLAPPING" 
AREAS IS "UNACCEPTABLE" TO VIETNAM.  PRC EMBOFF XI SAID 
WORKING-LEVEL INTER-MINISTERIAL MEETINGS TO RESOLVE THESE 
ISSUES "WILL CONTINUE." 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  PRC EMBOFF XI SAID THAT THAT THE TWO SIDES HAD 
SIGNED TWO DOCUMENTS DURING THE VISIT.  ONE WAS A NON- 
REPAYABLE LOAN OF ABOUT USD 6.2 MILLION.  THE OTHER WAS A 
FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDE A PREFERENTIAL LOAN FOR TECHNICAL 
ASSISTANCE FOR THE SAME AMOUNT.  ONE SPECIFIC USE OF THE 
LOANS IS TO SUPPORT BILATERAL YOUTH EXCHANGES.  PRC EMBOFF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HANOI  00614  02 OF 04  151753Z 
XI WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE SPECIFICS REGARDING THE TECHNICAL 
ASSISTANCE ASPECT.  DR. QUY SAID THESE LOANS WOULD BE 
VALUABLE FOR VIETNAM AND THAT INCREASING ECONOMIC 
COOPERATION WILL "INEVITABLY" LEAD TO FURTHER POLITICAL 
COOPERATION. 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  BOTH DR. QUY AND XI HUI POINTED TO THE VISIT'S 
FOCUS TOWARDS YOUTH.  ASIDE FROM THE YOUTH EXCHANGE SUPPORT, 
DURING THE VISIT JIANG ALSO ADDRESSED STUDENTS AT THE HANOI 
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, WHERE HE URGED YOUNG PEOPLE TO "TAKE 
OVER THE BATON" OF FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND 
"FURTHER THE CAUSE OF PEACE" IN ASIA AND THE WORLD. 
 
-------------------- 
VISIT NOT A SURPRISE 
-------------------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU)  JIANG'S VISIT APPEARED WELL PLANNED AND INCLUDED 
A LARGE ENTOURAGE, ACCORDING TO DR. QUY.  PRC EMBOFF XI TOLD 
POLOFF LAST DECEMBER THAT JIANG WAS EXPECTED TO VISIT DURING 
¶2002.  DR. QUY VIEWED THE VISIT AS PART OF THE PATTERN OF 
REGULAR, SENIOR-LEVEL BILATERAL VISITS.  DR. QUY SUGGESTED 
THAT SINCE JIANG WILL SOON BE RETIRING, THIS VISIT COULD 
ALSO HAVE BEEN A "FAREWELL" TO THE PRESENT VIETNAMESE

DISSENT OVER LAND BORDER "OVERBLOWN" 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶11.  (SBU)  THE MFA'S HAI SAID BOTH SIDES REAFFIRMED THE 
COMMITMENT TO FINISH MARKING THE LAND BORDER "ON TIME." 
WHEN ASKED ABOUT REPORTS THAT THERE ARE SOME GROUPS WHO 
ACCUSE THE GVN OF GIVING AWAY TOO MUCH TO CHINA IN THE LAND 
BORDER TREATY, HAI SAID THAT "OUTSIDE GROUPS" ARE THE SOURCE 
FOR THESE REPORTS, WHICH ARE "OVERBLOWN."  IN DR. QUY'S 
VIEW, DISSENT COULD BE DUE TO "LOCAL SENSITIVITIES," SINCE 
SOME PEOPLE FOUND THEMSELVES ON THE "WRONG SIDE" OF THE 
BORDER.  DR. QUY SAID THAT WHILE THE LAND BORDER ISSUE "IS 
SETTLED," IT IS NECESSARY TO "STABILIZE" THE POPULATION BY 
PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE LAND FOR DISPLACED FAMILIES.  HE SAID 
IT WAS ALSO IMPORTANT TO (1) FINISH THE BORDER DEMARCATION 
"AS SOON AS POSSIBLE" AND (2) EDUCATE PEOPLE "BETTER TO 
UNDERSTAND" THE BORDER ARRANGEMENTS.

CAM RANH BAY/SOUTH CHINA SEA 
---------------------------- 
 
¶12.  (SBU)  SOURCES HERE WERE UNABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE 
LEADERS HAD DISCUSSED THE FUTURE OF CAM RANH BAY (AS NOTED 
IN EMBASSY BEIJING'S EXCELLENT WRAP-UP OF THE VISIT - 
REFTEL); THE ISSUE WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THE GVN COMMUNIQU 
OR PRESS ACCOUNTS.  HOWEVER, TECO'S HSIEH SAID THAT IT 
SEEMED UNLIKELY THAT THERE HAD BEEN ANY MEANINGFUL 
DISCUSSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT.  GIVEN CAM RANH BAY'S PROXIMITY 
TO THE DISPUTED SPRATLY ISLAND CHAIN, VIETNAM "WILL NEVER" 
GRANT CHINA ACCESS TO THE BASE, HE PREDICTED.  THE TWO SIDES 
DID REITERATE THEIR DESIRE FOR "PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS" TO 
SETTLE OUTSTANDING SOUTH CHINA SEA ISSUES.  WHILE PRC EMBOFF 
XI SAID THE TWO SIDES "MADE SOME PROGRESS" ON THIS ISSUE, 
SHE WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE SPECIFICS. 
 
---------------- 
PARTY DISCUSSION 
---------------- 
 
¶13.  (SBU)  COLONEL NHUNG OF THE "PEOPLES ARMY" SAID THAT 
JIANG HAD ALSO BRIEFED GVN LEADERS ABOUT THE UPCOMING 16TH 
PARTY CONGRESS AND DISCUSSED SOME POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS OF 
PARTY PHILOSOPHY, SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THE NEED TO 
"CONSIDER THE BASIC INTERESTS OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE" AND TO 
EMPHASIZE THAT THE PARTY SHOULD ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT IT 
REPRESENTS "CHINESE CULTURE."  ACCORDING TO COLONEL NHUNG, 
THIS REPRESENTS SOME IDEOLOGICAL CHANGE FROM THE PARTY'S 
PRIMARY FOCUS ON THE STRUGGLE OF THE WORKERS.  COLONEL NHUNG 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HANOI  00614  03 OF 04  151753Z 
OPINED THAT IT IS HIS SENSE THE CCP IS GRADUALLY CHANGING 
ITS IDEOLOGICAL FOCUS AND JIANG WANTED TO CONVEY THIS 
MESSAGE TO HIS COUNTERPARTS IN VIETNAM.  HE NOTED THAT THE 
LEADERSHIP IN THE CPV HAD "NOTICED" THIS, BECAUSE THEY PAY 
"VERY CLOSE ATTENTION" TO WHATEVER GOES ON IN CHINA. 
COLONEL NHUNG SAID THAT THE CPV LEADERSHIP HAD FORMED "FOCUS 
GROUPS" TO STUDY THESE CHANGES AND TO JUDGE WHAT EXTENT THEY 
COULD APPLY TO VIETNAM.  THE LEADERSHIP IN VIETNAM WILL TAKE 
A "CAUTIOUS APPROACH," HE PREDICTED.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶14.  (SBU)  THE JIANG VISIT APPEARS TO HAVE SERVED ITS BASIC 
PURPOSE OF REAFFIRMING THE INCREASINGLY STRONG BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP, ALTHOUGH WE AGREE WITH EMBASSY BEIJING THAT 
THE VISIT WAS MORE ABOUT FORM THAN SUBSTANCE.  WE ARE 
PUZZLED THAT THE PRC DID NOT PUSH THE GVN FOR A FORMAL 
REAFFIRMATION OF ITS "ONE CHINA" POLICY, HOWEVER.  IN ANY 
EVENT, THE WARMTH OF JIANG'S RECEPTION HERE AND THE HIGH 
PROFILE COVERAGE IT RECEIVED IN THE LOCAL MEDIA ARE ACCURATE 
INDICATORS OF THE IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN BILATERAL TIES THAT 
THE TWO SIDES HAVE MADE OVER THE PAST DECADE.
