(SBU) On December 2, PolOff met with MFA International 
Organizations Assistant Director General Do Hung Viet to deliver 
reftel demarche regarding the Iranian uranium enrichment facility 
and to urge Vietnam to support efforts to hold Iran to its 
international nonproliferation obligations.  PolOff briefed Viet on 
the latest developments and encouraged Vietnam's mission in New 
York to coordinate closely with USUN.  Viet expressed appreciation 
for the information, but offered no substantive comment.  He 
promised to relay the information to his supervisors at the Foreign 
Ministry and to Vietnamese officials in New York.  Viet reiterated 
Vietnam's support for international non-proliferation objectives

the same time, he stressed that each country, including Iran, had a 
right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
