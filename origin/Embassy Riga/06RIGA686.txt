Â¶1. (SBU) Pol/econ off met on August 25 with Signe Jansone, MFA 
A/S-level official responsible for the Middle East to deliver 
demarche on Latvian attendance and financial commitments at the 
August 31 Stockholm Donor Conference on Lebanon.  She said that the 
Latvian delegation will be headed by Maija Monika, MFA U/S for 
Economic Issues.  Jansone stated that at this time Latvia does not 
plan to commit to any new financial assistance to Lebanon in 
Stockholm, but that the decision may be reviewed early next week. 
She noted that Latvia sent 40,000 Lats (roughly 73,000 USD) worth of 
humanitarian supplies to Lebanon earlier, and that Latvia's 
attendance in Stockholm is meant to show their political support for 
the assistance efforts.  Jansone added that the MFA is looking to 
see if some Latvian businesses might be interested in exploring 
opportunities for longer-term reconstruction projects in Lebanon.
