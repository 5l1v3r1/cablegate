¶1. (C) "I think that we are close to a deal on joint 
recognition of Kosovo," First VP and FM Samuel Lewis told 
Ambassador on April 25 in response to reftel demarche. 
Except for Nicaragua, which was unlikely to recognize, and 
Costa Rica, which already had, Lewis acknowledged that El 
Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala were interested in joining 
their partners in the region to recognize Kosovo.  Asked how 
close at hand such a joint recognition was, Lewis said, "It 
should happen shortly," and added, "I will talk with my 
colleagues." 
 
¶2. (C) Comment:  Post has heard "soon," "shortly," and 
"close" for several weeks  -- indeed a couple of months -- 
regarding Panama's intention to recognize Kosovo.  Lewis is 
likely growing weary of our repeated inquiries, but post will 
stay engaged and urges Department to consider pressing other 
Central American countries that might join with Panama in a 
joint recognition move.
