First VP and FM Generally Supportive

¶1.  (C) US and UK Ambassadors jointly presented reftel A 
demarche to First VP and FM Samuel Lewis on December 14 
regarding the extension of the mandates for the Multinational 
Forces - Iraq (MNF-I), the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) 
and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB). 
Lewis expressed general support for this mandate renewal 
effort and remarked that he did not believe that this 
resolution would be problematic.  Lewis asked whether the 
U.S. and Iraq were pressing ahead with efforts to normalize 
their bilateral security relationship; he was pleased to 
learn that Iraq and the U.S. were continuing to work on this 
issue.  POLCOUNS shared a copy of reftel B demarche regarding 
the Declaration of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship of 
Cooperation and Friendship between the Republic of Iraq and 
the United States of America that been provided to VFM 
Ricardo Duran (reftel C).  Asked that Panama co-sponsor this 
resolution, Lewis inquired as to whether any UN Security 
Council members had voiced opposition to this resolution.

¶2.  (C) If a broad enough consensus can be assembled, Panama 
would likely co-sponsor this UNSCR.  As usual, Panama will 
seek to run for the middle of as broad a consensus as 
possible to avoid being singled out or isolated on this issue.
