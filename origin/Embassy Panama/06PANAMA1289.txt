SUBJECT: PANAMA REQUESTS NOTE EXCHANGE FOR PANAMAX 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request.  See paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Panama has requested a diplomatic note exchange for 
the August PANAMAX exercise.  The note does not suggest any 
change to our existing policy; it essentially puts on paper 
what has always taken place in practice.  The GOP wants this 
note for political cover in case it comes under criticism for 
hosting PANAMAX.  The note allows the GOP to say it is in 
charge of PANAMAX and the exercise is taking place because 
the GOP wants it.  Embassy forwarded the proposed text to the 
Department June 29. 
 
¶3.  (U) Embassy asks that the Department review the text for 
clearance as soon as possible.
