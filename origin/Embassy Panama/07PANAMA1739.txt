REF: STATE 152276 
 
Classified By: POLCOUNS Brian R. Naranjo.  Reasons:  1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request; see para 5.

Summary 
------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  "Panama is prepared to assume the case" to prosecute 
the alleged pirates who have seized the GOLDEN NORI off the 
coast of Somalia, Public Ministry Secretary for International 
Affairs Greta Marchovsky told POLCOUNS on November 4. 
Following Ambassador's delivery of reftel demarche, First VP 
and FM Samuel Lewis told Ambassador that he and the MFA were 
in contact with Attorney General Ana Matilde Gomez and the 
Public Ministry:  "The Attorney General is being cooperative, 
and I have instructed the Foreign Ministry to lean forward" 
to help resolve this matter. "There is no question that 
prosecution of this alleged act of piracy would fall within 
Panama's jurisdiction," MFA Legal Counselor Iana Quadri told 
POLCOUNS.  All GOP officials with whom Embassy officials 
spoke, however, underscored that extensive USG assistance 
would be essential to support Panama's ability to prosecute 
effectively the perpetrators of these alleged acts of piracy 
against the GOLDEN NORI.  End summary.

First VP and FM: GOP to "Lean Forward" 
---------------- --------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C) "I have instructed the Foreign Ministry to lean 
forward" to help bring to justice the perpetrators of these 
acts of piracy against the GOLDEN NORI, First VP and FM 
Samuel Lewis told Ambassador on November 4.  Lewis, who was 
preparing to depart on an overseas tripon the afternoon of 
November 4, also undertook to engage Panama's 
quasi-independent Attorney General Ana Matilde Gomez; "She is 
being cooperative," Lewis informed Ambassador.

"Prepared to Assume Case;" "Panama Has Jurisdiction" 
-------------------------- ------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) "Panama is prepared to assume this case," Public 
Ministry Secretary for International Affairs Greta Marchovsky 
told POLCOUNS on November 4.  After hearing the details of 
the case and subsequently consulting with Attorney General 
Gomez, Marchovsky noted, "It is imperative to act to preserve 
the lives of the crew members aboard the GOLDEN NORI." 
(Note:  Panama's Public Ministry, essentially the national 
prosecutor's office, is a quasi-independent institution in 
Panama.  The Attorney General heads the Public Ministry.)  In 
parallel consultations, MFA Legal Advisor Iana Quadri told 
POLCOUNS, "There is no question that Panama has jurisdiction 
since this act of piracy was committed against a 
Panamanian-flagged ship."  Both Marchovsky and Quadri 
underscored that Panama would require extensive USG 
assistance to prosecute effectively the perpetrators of these 
acts of piracy, including, but not limited to assistance in: 
facilitating the travel of Panamanian law enforcement 
personnel to Somalia, transporting the suspects to Panama, 
and acquiring and securing evidence. 
 
-------------- 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) MFA Legal Counselor Quadri has asked for a formal 
diplomatic note requesting Panama's assistance in bringing 
the persons apprehended for involvement in the piracy of the 
GOLDEN NORI to justice by accepting custody of and 
prosecuting any apprehended persons.  Post recommends that 
 
the diplomatic note provide an indication as to the extent of 
any assistance and support that the USG can offer to help 
ensure effective prosecution.  Post requests guidance and 
language for such a diplomatic note by OOB, Tuesday, November 
¶6. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (C)  Panama's rapid and positive response regarding its 
willingness to prosecute the suspects in the acts of piracy 
against the GOLDEN MORI underscores Panama's desire to strive 
to be a strategic partner of the U.S.  Though Panama is 
presently celebrating its most important national days over a 
long weekend -- equivalent to the 4th of July, Memorial Day, 
and Veteran's Day all rolled into one -- Lewis, Gomez and 
their lead advisors engaged immediately and all clearly 
understood the importance of Panama acting decisively on this 
matter.  Post will need to coordinate extensively with the 
GOP to determine the kinds, extent, and specifics of the 
assistance that Panama will need to follow through on its 
commitment to prosecute.  That coordination can begin as soon 
as OOB, Tuesday, November 6.
