SUBJECT: PANAMA:  GEORGIA UNSCR DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 86130 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR BARBARA J. STEPHENSON.  REASONS:  1.4 (D) 
 
¶1. (C) "Panama is in favor of an immediate cessation of 
hostilities," First VP and FM Samuel Lewis told Ambassador in 
response to REFTEL demarche.  Pressed that Panama's support 
would be essential especially in the event that Russia 
exercised its veto so that the Council could speak with the 
loudest voice possible, Lewis commented that he would prefer 
a "15-0" resolution to a "14-1" resolution in which Russia 
vetoed.  Ambassador underscored that it was unlikely that an 
meaningful resolution could be crafted to ensure a unanimous 
vote on this matter; Lewis accepted the point. 
 
¶2. (C) Comment:  Panama is loathe to be party to either side 
of a split UNSC, even if Russia is isolated.  Post will 
follow ambassadorial-level demarche with further engagement, 
to be reported SEPTEL, at the working level.
