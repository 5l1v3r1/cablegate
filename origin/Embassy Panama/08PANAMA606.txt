TAGS: PTER SNAR PGOV PREL CO VE HR EUN AF PM
SUBJECT: PANAMA:  DEMARCHE ON KEEPING PRESSURE ON THE FARC 
DELIVERED 

REF: STATE 77205 

Classified By: POLCOUNS BRIAN R. NARANJO.  REASONS:  1.4 (B) AND (D). 

¶1. (C) First VP and FM Samuel Lewis thanked Charge for 
sharing with him reftel demarche, but did not commit to make 
any efforts to encourage governments and entities that 
historically supported the FARC to take demonstrable steps to 
sever ties with the FARC, deny it safe-haven, and withhold 
any form of material or other support. 

¶2. (C) COMMENT:  Post does not believe that Panama will do 
much, if anything, to increase the pressure on the FARC. 
Struggling to accept -- to say nothing of taking effective 
action to grapple with -- the growing FARC presence and 
activity on its own soil, Panama is reluctant to draw 
attention to itself by directly confronting the FARC.  Also, 
GOP officials refrain from commenting on the FARC, something 
view the FARC as Colombia's problem, and prefer to refer to 
Colombian criminal organizations.
