Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) Minister of Trade and Industries Carmen Gisela Vergara 
told the Ambassador that the government of Panama (GOP) is 
willing to take direction from the U.S. Government (USG) in 
promoting the Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) in order to 
improve the chances for Congressional approval.  The GOP is 
ready for the implementation phase of the TPA whenever the 
U.S. is ready.

GOP's TPA Talking Points? 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) During the Ambassador's August 26, 2008 courtesy call 
with Minister of Trade and Industries (MICI) Carmen Gisela 
Vergara, Vergara stated that the GOP respects the political 
process of the United States and understands and relates to 
political difficulties regarding the TPA.  Vergara noted that 
the GOP is ready for the implementation phase of the TPA 
whenever the U.S. is ready - whether it be now, this fall, or 
after the U.S. elections.  She stated the GOP has the same 
objective as the USG - passage and implementation of the TPA. 
 Therefore, the GOP is willing to take direction from the USG 
in promoting the TPA in order to "not hinder" the chances for 
Congressional approval. 
 
-------------- 
IMPLEMENTATION 
-------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Vergara noted that the GOP has moved forward to 
implement certain portions of the TPA that are good for the 
business climate and for transparency in government.  Vergara 
illustrated this point by discussing an Internet-based system 
that allows exporters to gain permission for shipping goods 
instead of waiting for a clerk to process the request during 
normal business hours. 
 
----------------------- 
TRANSPARENCY/INNOVATION 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Vergara discussed how the Torrijos Administration 
policies are driving transparency and innovation in Panama. 
In addition to reforms called for by the TPA, the GOP is also 
using the Office of the Secretary of Innovation to simplify 
government processes to improve transparency and the business 
climate.  Examples are: the computerized system to track 
shipments in the Colon Free Trade Zone which was implemented 
this summer, the GOP's Internet-based procurement system 
(PanamaCompra), and the Internet-based business registration 
system (PanamaEmprende).  According to Vergara, a business 
can now register on-line in twenty minutes and immediately 
print out the business license.  Additionally, Vergara 
believes these new systems minimize the opportunities for 
corruption and increase transparency.
