¶1. (C) Ambassador presented reftel demarche to First VP and 
FM Samuel Lewis on June 30 on the margins of President 
Torrijos' farewell lunch in honor of the Ambassador.  In 
addition to raising reftel points, Ambassador noted that 
Panama had previously indicated it would recognize Panama 
"soon, but after the Europeans" and subsequently informed 
Ambassador that Panama was working with its Central American 
neighbors to organize a joint recognition.  Now that 
two-thirds of the EU had recognized Kosovo and Panama had had 
two months to work toward a joint recognition with its 
neighbors, Ambassador inquired when Panama might recognize 
Kosovo  Lewis was noncommittal and said he would consult with 
the MFA before getting back to the Embassy.

¶2. (C) Post believes that Panama has no intention of moving 
forward on recognizing Kosovo any time soon.  Furthermore, 
the Ambassador was left with the impression that Panama has 
done little, if anything, to organize a joint recognition 
with its Central American neighbors.
