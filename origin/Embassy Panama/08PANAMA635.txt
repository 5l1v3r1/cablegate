Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C)  The Democratic Revolutionary Party's (PRD) National 
Assembly (NA) caucus formally selected Raul Rodriguez on July 
29 as their candidate to replace Pedro Miguel Gonzalez (PMG) 
as President of the National Assembly (see Reftel). The 
actual election will take place on September 1 when the NA 
reconvenes, but his victory is a virtual certainty. The 
selection of the relatively unknown Rodriguez is a sign that 
President Torrijos as reasserted his control over the NA 
caucus, after last year's election of PMG.

PMG To Be Replaced September 1

¶2.  (U)  The Democratic Revolutionary Party's (PRD) National 
Assembly (NA) caucus met July 29 and selected Raul Rodriguez 
as its candidate for President of the National Assembly. 
Given party discipline, and the PRD's majority in the NA, 
this decision means that Rodriguez will replace Pedro Miguel 
Gonzalez (PMG) as President of the National Assembly on 
September 1. Rodriguez will serve out the last year of this 
legislature's five-year term. Rodriguez is a first term 
Deputy. 
 
¶3.  (U)  The caucus also selected first term Deputy Nelson 
Jackson, representing Colon, as its candidate for Vice 
President of the National Assembly, and first termer 
Elizabeth de Quiroz as its candidate for Second Vice 
President. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Third term Deputy Ruben De Leon was chosen as the 
PRD Majority Leader. Deputy De Leon has taken controversial 
positions on issues of interest to the USG in the past. He 
voted against the Corozal Cemetery Agreement in 2000, which 
authorized the continued existence of the U.S. military 
cemetery at Corozal, and against the agreement authorizing 
OPIC to work in Panama, also in 2000.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶5.  (C)  The choice of these relatively unknown Deputies to 
direct the NA is an indication that President Torrijos has 
reasserted his power over the PRD caucus. Last year's 
election of PMG embarrassed Torrijos and damaged the chances 
for passage of the TPA by the U.S. Congress. Torrijos has 
sent a clear message to the NA that he expects no surprises 
during his last year in power.
