¶4. (C) To celebrate Peace Corps' 45 year commitment to 
service in Panama, Director Tschetter, Ambassador Eaton, 
and Country Director Peter Redmond met with FM Samuel Lewis 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The Foreign Minister 
expressed his appreciation of the Peace Corps program and 
showed gratitude to the Ambassador for his service in Panama. 
 (Note: Ambassador will conclude his tour in Panama on July

Corps' contribution to economic growth and social development 
in Panama.  Both were pleased with Panama's progress and 
optimistic about the country's potential for sustainable

and underscored the importance of the U.S.-Panama Free Trade 
Agreement.

PEACE CORPS CELEBRATES 45 YEARS OF FRIENDSHIP WITH PANAMA 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) FM Lewis recognized the Peace Corps' contribution to 
economic growth and social development in Panama.  Over 45 
years, 1700 Peace Corps volunteers had served in Panama.  The 
recent Peace Corps initiative to develop Panama's tourism 
industry and increase access to information technology had 
created economic opportunities for local communities, 
particularly those located in the countryside, Lewis 
asserted.  FM Lewis encouraged Peace Corps to expand its 
tourism program to additional areas that could benefit from 
further income generation.

¶6. (SBU) Following Director Tschetter's recognition of 
Panama's economic growth, FM Lewis highlighted the economic 
benefits of the expansion of the Panama Canal.  The FM noted 
that the expansion project was "ahead of schedule and under 
budget."  He also mentioned that the project is scheduled to 
be completed August 15, 2014, the 100 year anniversary of its 
original opening.  The canal, a vital geographic resource, 
generated jobs and stimulated a number of economic activities 
including tourism and trade, the FM said.
