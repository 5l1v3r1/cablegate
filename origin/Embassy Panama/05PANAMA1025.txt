POSITION ON UNCHR INTERSESSIONAL WORKING GROUP IN GENEVA 
 
REF: STATE 82967 
 
(SBU) PolOff delivered Reftel talking points to MFA Human 
Rights Director Janio Tunion and Deputy International 
Organizations and Commissions Director Nubia Lezcano on May 
5, stressing how the working group would undercut existing 
mechanisms at New York UN headquarters.  Tunion spoke with 
PolOff on May 6.  Speaking unofficially, Tunion said the GOP 
was aware that such a working group "would probably 
complicate things," when a process already exists for 
discussing UN Commission on Human Rights (CHR) reform. 
Tunion said unofficially that he opposes "excessive" 
sub-commissions and working groups in a system that was 
already "too big" to be effective, and added that senior MFA 
officials agree.  He said he would pass the talking points to 
his superiors.  Embassy will report any further developments 
to Department.
