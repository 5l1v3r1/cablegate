¶1.  (U) This cable provides a brief overview of NAS/Panama 
activities and major law enforcement and counternarcotics 
developments during the month of February, 2007. 
 
Meeting with Attorney General 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador, accompanied by NAS and DEA directors, met 
with Attorney General Ana Matilde Gomez in early February to discuss 
the Technical Judicial Police (PTJ) (Refs B and C).  Gomez stated 
that she and the Executive were in full agreement regarding the PTJ, 
namely keeping the institution largely intact and firmly under her 
direction.  However, at present, we understand high-level jockeying 
continues regarding the organization and mandate of the PTJ.  It is 
possible the institution will be divided, with some areas moved to 
the National Police (PNP).  We continue to discretely advocate 
keeping the PTJ largely intact and firmly under the direction of the 
AG, rather than the PNP. 
 
PTJ Internal Developments 
------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) NAS Director met with interim PTJ director Gustavo 
Barragan to discuss the direction and potential reorganization of 
the institution as well as ongoing programs.  With the exception of 
some hiccups over providing namechecks to Embassy offices, the PTJ 
has been working well with the Embassy under Barragan's leadership. 
While Barragan expressed a desire to be named the new director of 
the entity, he appears not to be under consideration by AG Gomez. 
Meanwhile, the 90-day forced leave of formal PTJ head Jaime Jacome 
ends on March 19, and Jacome tells us he plans to return to office. 
It remains to be seen, however, if AG Gomez will be able to prevent 
Jacome's return through some sort of administrative or legal 
maneuver. 
 
Maritime Service Leadership Change 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) National Maritime Service (SMN) head Ricardo Traad 
tendered his resignation but was subsequently asked to stay on for a 
short period by President Torrijos.  Our best information indicates 
that Ricardo Cigarruista of the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has 
been selected as the next SMN head.  The delay in formally naming a 
new director might relate to the pending public announcement of the 
GOP plan to merge the SMN and the National Air Service (SAN) into a 
unified coast guard (Ref A). 
 
Re-establishing CNIES 
--------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) NAS Director met with Vice Minister Severino Mejia of the 
Ministry of Government and Justice (MOGJ) to press for a GOP 
response to our mid-January diplomatic note regarding desired 
reestablishment of the suspended DOD Counternarcotics Information 
Exchange System (CNIES) feed.  Mejia and Foreign Ministry legal 
director Iana Quadri verbally accepted the legal language in our 
diplomatic note and promised a written response.  NAS and ECON also 
met with Eustacio Fabrega, head of the Civil Aviation Authority, to 
prepare the groundwork for an updated Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), once 
the GOP sends its formal answer to our diplomatic note. 
 
Follow-Up to MOGJ Colombia Visit 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) NAS and ODC also met with Mejia to discuss follow-up to 
his recent USG-funded visit to Colombia.  We were pleased to hear of 
a GOP commitment to training programs with Colombian police and 
military.  (We note that two members of the PNP border division are 
currently participating in the USG-funded "Jungla" commando course 
in Colombia.)  However, Mejia indicated that proposals beyond 
training with require inter-agency discussion as well as vetting at 
the annual Panama-Colombia binational border issues meeting 
(Combifron), to be held mid year. 
 
Police Training Taking Hold 
--------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (U) We have seen numerous signs that NAS-funded police 
modernization training for the PNP is being to take hold.  One key 
change involves institutionalization of the concepts being taught in 
our ongoing "Police Executive Leadership Seminar Series (PELSS). 
 
For the first time in a decade, the PNP has retooled both its 
mission and vision statements.  Second, and for the first time since 
its founding in 1990, the PNP is compiling a procedural manual for 
officers from top to bottom.  The PNP has also taken a hard look at 
improving morale in the lower ranks.  Lastly, the PNP is 
institutionalizing the problem-oriented policing concept by creating 
a training module for all subordinate officers from the rank of 
agent (agente) to major (mayor). 
 
National Police Donation Ceremony 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (U) The Ambassador presided over a well-publicized donation 
ceremony for two Donzi go-fast boats and four HUMVEE ambulances for 
the border division of the PNP.  The Ambassador emphasized the dual 
purpose of the HUMVEES, which will provide medical transport 
capability for both PNP members and local residents.  MOGJ Minister 
Olga Golcher lauded the U.S.-Panama bilateral law enforcement 
relationship.  NAS Director discussed reductions in U.S. assistance 
to Panama with press on the margins of the ceremony.
