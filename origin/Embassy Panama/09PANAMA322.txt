SUBJECT: PANAMA: DEMARCHE ON KOSOVO'S IMF AND WORLD BANK 
MEMBERSHIP BID DELIVERED

(C) "Having recognized Kosovo in January, Panama will have to 
act in a manner consistent with that decision and support 
Kosovo's membership in both the IMF and World Bank," Acting 
FM Javier Bonagas told POLCOUNS on April 17.  Previously, 
Ambassador had sent First VP and FM Samuel Lewis and Minister 
of Economy and Finance letters on April 8 urging Panama to 
support fully Kosovo's membership in these IFIs.  Due to top 
GOP officials' extensive travel over the past few weeks, post 
has had significant difficulty securing appointments for 
Ambassador to see Lewis and Alexander regarding this 
demarche.  Ambassador did have the opportunity to flag this 
issue for Lewis briefly last week on the margins of a meeting 
concerning efforts to advance the U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion 
Agreement toward ratification, and POLCOUNS followed up to 
deliver reftel demarche.  While not enthusiastic in 
expressing support for Kosovo's bid to become a member of the 
World Bank, Bonagas was resigned believing Panama, having 
recognized Kosovo, had no other alternative but to support 
Kosovar membership in the IFIs.  Bonagas undertook to 
coordinate closely with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, 
which to date has not played a part in the MFA-led engagement 
on Kosovo.
