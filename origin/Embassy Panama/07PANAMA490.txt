"Panama supports initiatives such as this that lead our 
country in the right direction," Panamanian First VP and FM 
Samuel Lewis told U.S. Ambassador Eaton and Russian 
Ambassador to Panama Evgeny Voronin when they delivered 
reftel demarche on March 29.  Panamanian MFA DG for 
International Political Affairs Javier Bonogas and Senior 
Advisor for UNSC Affairs Nils Castro accompanied Lewis.  U.S. 
and Russian Ambassadors invited Panama to become a partner 
nation in President Putin's and President Bush's Global 
Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and to notify formally 
both ambassadors in writing if Panama was prepared to support 
this initiative's statement of principles.  Lewis undertook 
to examine the statement of principles and to provide a 
response to this joint U.S.-Russian presentation.  Ambassador 
also previewed this demarche with Lewis on the margins of a 
March 28 dinner at the Ambassador's residence.
