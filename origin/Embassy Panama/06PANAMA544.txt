SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  (SBU) On Thursday, March 16 Panamanian newspapers 
reported in banner headlines that the U.S. Federal Bureau of 
Prisons plans to release former Panamanian dictator Manuel 
Antonio Noriega on September 9, 2007, after 17 years in a 
Tampa, Florida prison, and that Noriega would return to 
Panama.  Noriega has been convicted in Panama for several 
murders and other crimes that carry 20-year sentences.  The 
GOP claims that two of its extradition requests are pending 
before the USG since the 1990's.  The Supreme Court and the 
Public Ministry are already jockeying for control of the 
case.  End summary. 
 
GOP reactions 
------------- 
¶2.  (U) The GOP reacted immediately.  Following the March 16 
headlines, President Torrijos firmly stated that Noriega's 
return is not a political issue, but a judicial one that 
should be handled by the Supreme Court according to the 
Constitution just like with any other Panamanian citizen. 
Vice President/Foreign Minister Samuel Lewis backed by 
Panamanian Ambassador in the U.S. Federico Humbert, publicly 
stated that Noriega's release is a "judicial" issue and that 
the GOP would only transmit to the USG any request for 
extradition coming from the authorities. 
 
¶3.  (U) Separately, Attorney General Ana Matilde Gomez 
announced that the Public Ministry is ready to request 
Noriega's extradition as well.  Gomez has asked Public 
Ministry officers to submit updated reports on Noriega's 
convictions in Panama, to include any pending cases against 
him. (Note:  Noriega has two 20-year convictions for the 
murders of military officers who opposed him; a 15-year 
conviction for the murder of physician Hugo Spadafora; an 8- 
year conviction for embezzlement; a 5-year conviction for 
alien smuggling; and finally an 18-month conviction for 
illicit enrichment.  Convictions in Panama always are served 
concurrently.  End note.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) MFA Director for Legal Affairs Iana Quadri, 
backing Lewis and Humbert, told Emboff that Panamanian law 
requires extradition requests of convicted felons to come 
from the Supreme Court.  Quadri added that in some cases, 
the Public Ministry is also authorized to make extradition 
requests.  In either case, Panama's MFA would be the 
authority channeling the request to the USG.  Quadri claimed 
that MFA has two extradition requests for Noriega pending. 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶5.  (SBU) The GOP clearly was eager to pass the ball to the 
judiciary to avoid any taint from Noriega.  But is the GOP 
also hedging its bets?  In 2005 President Torrijos appointed 
Noriega's daughter, Sandra, to a consular post in the 
Dominican Republic.  Just last week, the Ministry of Foreign 
Relations appointed Noriega's youngest daughter, Thais, as 
an entry-level diplomat.  (In fact, Thais Noriega entered 
Panama's Foreign Service with nine others.  All ten got 
failing grades on the entrance exam, although Thais got the 
highest marks of the ten.  Foreign Minister Lewis decided to 
admit all ten.)  Panamanians have mixed feelings on whether 
Noriega should return to Panama or not.  There is no doubt 
that Panamanians want Noriega to pay for his crimes, yet 
many feel that his return to Panama could be dangerous. 
Noriega still has friends here.  He undoubtedly has large 
amounts of money stashed away.  He knows lots of 
incriminating details about many people in and out of 
government.  He could end up escaping from prison.  Lack of 
security in prisons as well as corrupted officials have 
allowed criminals to escape in the past.  Panamanians have 
no guarantee that Noriega would not do the same.
