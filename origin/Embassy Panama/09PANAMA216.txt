Â¶1. (C) Ambassador met with Vice President/Foreign Minister 
Samuel Lewis on March 13 and inquired about Lewis' upcoming 
trip to Havana on March 16.  Lewis said that he and Vice 
Minister of Trade Severo Sousa will sign a trade agreement 
entitled "acuerdo de alcance parcial."  Lewis said that 
Panama negotiated the agreement several months ago and that 
the Cubans "insisted" that he come and sign it now.  Lewis 
told Ambassador that he believed that, considering Panama,s 
role as regional as bridge builder, it will be useful for him 
to go and gauge the Cubans' attitudes in light of the 
upcoming Summit of the Americas.  Lewis will be in Havana for 
one day.
