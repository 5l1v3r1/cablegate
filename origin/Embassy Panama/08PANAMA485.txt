Classified By: Economic Section Chief Timothy P. Lattimer 
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (S) Econoff delivered ref points and background 
information for the three reftels on June 10 to Delia 
Villamonte, Director General of International Organizations 
and Conferences. Leoncio Hernandez, the Foreign Ministry's 
Director of the Department of Analysis Against Terrorist 
Activity, was unable to attend, but Villamonte will pass on 
all information to him.  Villamonte stated they would 
coordinate with relevant GOP entities to identify and freeze, 
as appropriate, financial assets these individuals and 
organizations might hold in Panama.  Villamonte specifically 
mentioned Panama's National Security Council, Bank 
Superintendency, Financial Analysis Unit, Stock Market 
Commission, and the Public Registry as the entities most 
likely to have data on such assets.  Villamonte confirmed 
that the GOP will advise if the GOP locates any assets held 
by the individuals or organizations and on any GOP steps 
taken regarding the same.
