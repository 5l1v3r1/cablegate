SUBJECT: PANAMA:  CHAVEZ'S CLOSURE OF RCTV "SOVEREIGN" 
DECISION, CANNOT "JUDGE" 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William A. Eaton.  Reason:  1.4 (d) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Decision to Close RCTV "Sovereign," Cannot be Judged 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶1.  (U)  "The decision to not renew RCTV's concession was a 
sovereign decision of the Government of Venezuela," 
Panamanian President Martin Torrijos told the press on May 25 
during a press conference in Brazil.  "Neither Panama nor any 
other country can judge whether or not the application of 
other countries' judicial norms constitutes a violation of 
human rights," First VP and FM Samuel said on May 30. 
Continuing, Lewis added, "Determining whether the refusal to 
renew a frequency concession constitutes a violation of human 
rights is not something that is not the responsibility of 
Panama or of the Organization of American States (OAS)." 
Repeatedly, Lewis has stated that neither RCTV nor the issue 
of press freedoms in Venezuela will be on "the agenda" of the 
OAS General Assembly that Panama will host June 3-5.

"We are the hosts . . . and need to be careful"

¶2.  (C)  "We are the hosts of the OAS General Assembly, and 
we need to be careful about how we handle the RCTV issue and 
Venezuela," Lewis told Ambassador on the margins of a 
breakfast at Lewis' residence on May 31.  "We cannot put 
Panama in the position of commenting on internal decisions 
such as Chavez's with respect to RCTV.  We cannot come out 
and support RCTV."  Lewis underscored twice that Panama was 
striving to maintain the focus on the this OASGA's theme of 
energy for development and opportunities in Panama.  Panama 
had managed preparations for the OASGA to avoid conflict 
between the U.S. and Venezuela.  By pursuing the theme of 
energy for development -- especially with the inclusion of 
discussion of alternative fuels such as ethanol, something 
anathema to oil rich Venezuela -- Lewis asserted that Panama 
had successfully diverted any pre-OASGA tension from a 
U.S.-Venezuela dynamic to a dynamic in which Venezuela had to 
wrestle with its own neighbors who had major interests in 
ethanol, most notably Brazil. Pressed as to why Panama 
embraced Chavez's action rather than tout its own experience 
regarding the need to defend freedom of expression as it 
emerged from dictatorship, Lewis said, "We cannot pat 
ourselves on the head and say how attractive our daughter has 
become."  Should this issue arise during the Secretary's 
press availability with President Torrijos, Lewis instead 
asked that the U.S. draw attention to the important role 
protection of freedom of expression had in Panama restoration 
of democracy.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶3.  (C)  Torrijos and Lewis have gotten themselves into a jam 
with its remarks defending Chavez's closure of RCTV.  We can 
only speculate whether Torrijos' and Lewis' remarks were the 
price that Panama agreed to pay to avert a Chavez visit to 
the OASGA.  Domestically, Torrijos and Lewis have taken a 
beating as civic organizations, chambers of commerce, and 
press associations in addition to political leaders from 
across the opposition spectrum have roundly criticized them 
for their fickle posture on this matter.  Many such 
commentators have questioned whether Torrijos' and Lewis' 
lackluster defense of freedom of expression suggests that the 
governing Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) has really 
come that far from its dictatorial roots.  This issue may 
continue to resonate internally as opposition leaders raise 
the specter of a "civil dictatorship" by the PRD that 
dominates Panama's governmental institutions.  Lewis clearly 
is desperate for a successful OASGA to the point of vainly 
hoping that the RCTV issue and Venezuela do not cast a shadow 
across the OASGA's proceedings.
