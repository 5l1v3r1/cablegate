SUBJECT: PANAMA:  KOSOVO FINAL STATUS DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 167211 
 
Classified By: POLCOUNS Brian R. Naranjo.  Reasons:  1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) Ambassador delivered reftel demarche to First VP and FM 
Samuel Lewis on December 17.  Lewis had no substantive 
response.  Post will report any subsequent reactions to this 
demarche. Previously, Lewis had voiced concerns about efforts 
to move ahead "precipitously" on Kosovo in the UNSC.  Post 
anticipates that Panama will be uneasy about any prospective 
split over or confrontation on Kosovo in the Council and will 
seek to maintain as low a profile as possible.
