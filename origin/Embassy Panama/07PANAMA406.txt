Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) "We do not foresee a problem with the draft UN 
Security Council Resolution on Iran that was prepared by the 
P-5 1 and anticipate that it will be adopted early next 
week," Panamanian MFA Senior Advisor for UN Security Council 
Matters Nils Castro told POLCOUNS on March 16.  Though he 
complained about the lack of early consultation with the E-10 
regarding the resolution's text, Castro did not believe that 
any significant "observations" would be made on March 19 in 
New York and that the resolution would be passed quickly with 
Panama's support.  Noting the very grave situation Sudan, 
Castro said that the GOS was "clearly aggravating the 
situation" and "using false pre-texts" to derail the 
peacekeeping effort.  Panama would voice its concerns on 
March 19 when UN U/SYG Guehenno briefed the Council on Sudan.

demarches.  Lewis is traveling in the U.S., and Duran is

any further high-level conversations on these matters. 
Castro was the highest-ranking available MFA official to 
receive this demarche.

Iran: Panama Supportive, but With Hurt Feelings 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶3.  (C) Noting that he had reviewed the P-5 1 draft UNSCR, 
Castro said that Panama had "no major concerns" and believed 
that the text was good.  Nonetheless, Castro said Panama 
shared South Africa's concerns that that E-10 were not being 
given sufficient time to consider the text and were not 
provided the opportunity to negotiate.  Castro welcomed the 
text's "gradualist" approach and said its "flexibility" would 
help bring about a diplomatic solution.  When the draft Iran 
UNSCR was discussed on the morning of March 19, Castro 
predicted that there would not be any serious observations 
and that the resolution would be quickly adopted next week 
with Panama's support.

Sudan:  Grave Situation, What to Do Next? 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) Castro said that Sudan was "clearly aggravating" the 
situation in Sudan and using "pre-texts" to derail UN-AU 
cooperation.  "This very grave situation is a clear threat to 
international peace and security," Castro added.  "We are 
running out of Chapter VI options."  Castro said Panama would 
voice its concerns on Sudan in New York.  Frustrated, Castro 
said he did not know what else could be done to pressure 
Sudan to accept a peacekeeping mission.  Though he winced at 
the prospect of "coercive measures," Castro acknowledge that 
the time for such measures may have arrived.  Castro said 
that he had already spoken with PANUN PermRep Arias, and they 
agreed that Panama had to speak out on the "humanitarian 
tragedy" in Sudan.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶5.  (C) Concerning Iran, Panama's concerns have been 
primarily about process and approach:  maintain consensus 
(especially among the P-5) and gradually ratchet up pressure 
on Iran.  While Panama's feelings are somewhat bruised for 
not having been brought into the negotiations on the P-5 1 
text, Panama will support this resolution since its concerns 
were met.  On Sudan, Panama will speak out against the 
continuing humanitarian crisis and may even directly 
criticize the Sudanese government, a government with which it 
has little at stake.  Panama will need to be brought along to 
accept coercive measures, and it's acknowledgment that 
"Chapter VI" options are running out should help pave the way 
to accept tougher steps.
