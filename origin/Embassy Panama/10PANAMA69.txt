SUBJECT: Terrorism Finance: Pre-Notification for UN 1267 Designation 
of Muthanna Harith Al-Dari 
 
REF: 2010 STATE 10054 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: bangert, econoff; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
1) (S) Econoff informed Tomas Guardia, Director of International 
Organization and Conferences at the Panamanian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, on February 9 of the future UN 1267 designation of 
Muthanna Harith Al-Dari per reftel.  Guardia stated he would take 
appropriate action.  Since Guardia had not previously received a UN 
1267 demarche before, Econoff informed Guardia of the actions the 
USG wants the GOP to take and the organizations within the GOP who 
should be informed of the designation by the MFA.
