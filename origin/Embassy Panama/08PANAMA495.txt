 PANAMA PROCEEDS WITH CAUTION 
 ------------------------------ 
¶1. (C) POL delivered reftel demarche to Panamanian MFA 
Security Council Advisor Janio Tunon on June 16. Tunon stated 
that the UNSC advisors would hold a routine weekly meeting on 
June 17 to discuss the UN Secretary General's proposal for 
the reconfiguration of UNMIK. Tunon noted that the GOP had 
two primary concerns: i) the European Commission's proposal 
to cease funding for operations of the economic 
reconstruction pillar of UNMIK on June 30; and ii) the 
potential for heightened tensions in the region if UNMIK 
reconfiguration was approved. The GOP felt it had to 
exercise caution to find the best solution to maintain peace 
in the region. 
 
¶2. (C) POL asked Janio Tunon for an update on Panama's 
position regarding recognition of Kosovo independence. Tunon 
responded that Panama was examining the issue and maintained 
dialogue with other Latin American countries, particularly 
Costa Rica. Tunon informed POL that the Security Council 
advisors would meet June 17 to discuss Kosovo.
