Torrijos Opposes National Day of Mourning 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (C) "President Torrijos wants you to know his concerns 
about Pedro Miguel's rant yesterday (December 13).  His 
proposed resolution is not this Administration's policy, and 
the President does not support the idea of a National Day of 
Mourning on December 20," First VP and FM Samuel Lewis told 
Ambassador on December 14 on the margins a previously planned 
meeting. Pressed by Ambassador whether Torrijos would veto 
the resolution if the National Assembly adopted it, Lewis 
dismissed the possibility that it would gain enough votes to 
pass.  (Note:  Embassy Panama reported reftel on resolution 
proposed by National Assembly President Pedro Miguel Gonzalez 
(PMG), who is under federal indictment in connection with the 
1992 murder of a U.S. serviceman, to establish December 20 -- 
the anniversary of the initiation of OPERATION JUST CAUSE -- 
as a National Day of Mourning.)

Salas-Becker:  Will Not Abrogate 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) Lewis also shared that Torrijos was equally disgusted 
with PMG's call to abrogate the U.S.-Panama Salas-Becker 
Maritime Cooperation Agreement.  "That will not happen," 
Lewis said categorically.  Noting that he also believed that 
such an effort would not gain the support of the National 
Assembly, Lewis added, "The President has stated emphatically 
that he would veto it."

GOP Appreciative of U.S. Handling of PMG's Rants 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶3.  (C) Lewis said that he and Torrijos appreciated "the 
mature way" that the U.S. had managed its public and private 
reaction to PMG's "rants."  "Not responding to him is the way 
that the U.S. and our Administration are and should continue 
to deal with PMG's ludicrous outbursts."  In response to 
press inquiry concerning PMG's National Day of Mourning 
Resolution, Embassy spokesman remarked, "We prefer to look 
forward and are very satisfied to have a mature democratic 
partner in Panama today."

Comment 
------- 
 
¶4. (C) Lewis is well aware of the continuing challenges that 
PMG presents to the bilateral relationship and is taking a 
hands-on approach to addressing those challenges.  Clearly, 
he has already been in close communication with Torrijos on 
both of PMG's most recent efforts to provoke not only the 
U.S., but also the Torrijos Administration.  Lewis' 
aggressive engagement to secure Torrijos' commitment to veto 
any challenge to Salas-Becker, a cornerstone of our bilateral 
counternarcotics cooperation is a strong indication that he 
does not want any recurrence of a PMG-related debacle that 
would further damage bilateral ties.
