SUBJECT: PANAMA:  GAZA UNSCR DEMARCHE DELIVERED

"Panama would like to see a more balanced text with respect 
to Gaza," Panamanian MFA UNSC advisor Ernesto Cerrud told 
POLCOUNS on March 5 in response to reftel demarche.  "The 
problem with these Middle East resolutions is that they are 
always so unbalanced and fail to adequately acknowledge the 
co-responsibility that both sides have."  Cerrud asserted 
that PanPR Ricardo Arias was likely to propose that the word 
"disproportionate (desproporcionado)" be replaced with 
"inordinate (desmesurado)."  POLCOUNS suggested that such 
word-smithing was unlikely to restore balance to the text and 
urged Panama to support broader efforts to restore balance to 
the text.  Cerrud agreed that if the language 
"disporporcionate or excessive" were struck that it would be 
possible to move forward on discussions on the text. 
(Comment:  The Spanish words "desporporcionado" and 
"desmesurado" have essentially the same meanings or at the 
very least are too close in meaning to have much of a 
distinction in this context.  The both mean: 
disproportionate, excessive, and inordinate.)
