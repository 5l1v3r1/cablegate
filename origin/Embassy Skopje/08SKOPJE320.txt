REF: STATE 21770 
 
Per Reftel, PolOff encouraged MFA Director for Multilateral 
Affairs Svetlana Geleva to ensure Macedonia's timely 
submission of a report detailing steps taken to implement 
UNSCR 1803 (Iran Sanctions) to the UNSC.  Geleva said that 
Macedonia's implementation of the provisions of UNSCR 1803 
has been delayed by the April 12 dissolution of Parliament 
and subsequent call for early Parliamentary elections. 
Geleva is hopeful that the technical government will take 
actions to implement the provisions of UNSCR 1803 next week. 
She indicated that Macedonia will promptly report 
implementation actions to the UNSC.
