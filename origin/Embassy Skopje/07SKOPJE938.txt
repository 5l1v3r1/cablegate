SUBJECT: MACEDONIA: PARLIAMENT APPROVES DOUBLING OF TROOPS 
FOR IRAQ 
 
 
(SBU) In a unanimous vote on November 30, the Macedonian 
Parliament approved the government's proposal to double 
Macedonia's troop contributions in Iraq.  The initiative 
received 70 MP votes in favor, and none against.  The Deputy 
Minister of Defense told MPs before the vote that the 
additional 36 troops could deploy to Iraq by as early as 
mid-December.  The troops will participate in combat patrols 
and other "outside the wire" activities with U.S. forces in 
Taji.  COMMENT: Foreshadowing the outcome of the vote, a 
governing coalition MP recently told us that Macedonia was 
committed to its own "surge" in Iraq; even as other countries 
were drawing down their forces, Macedonia would remain 
steadfast in supporting the U.S. in the field. End comment.
