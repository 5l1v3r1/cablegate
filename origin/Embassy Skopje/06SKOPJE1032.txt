LEBANON RESOLUTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 176793 
 
(SBU) PolOff delivered reftel points on opposing the two UNGA 
Lebanon-related resolutions to MFA Head of Sector for 
Multilateral Relations Goran Stevcevski on October 25. 
Stevcevski said that the GOM will consider the U.S. position, 
but made it clear that Macedonia likely would follow the 
joint EU position on the matter.  (NOTE: The GOM generally 
supports USG positions at the UNGA.  As an EU candidate 
country, however, Macedonia usually feels "bound" to follow 
the joint EU position, if it exists, on an UNGA resolution, 
even if the USG opposes it.  If there is no EU consensus, 
Macedonia generally will abstain or support the USG position. 
END NOTE.)
