REF: STATE 55654 
 
¶1.  This is an action request.  See para 4. 
 
¶2.  Per reftel, Charge met with Minister of Interior Gordana 
Jankuloska.  In response to our question about donation, lease, or 
sale of any of Macedonia's four MoI Mi-171 helicopters (a variant of 
Mi-17) for use in Pakistan, Jankuloska thought the GoM would 
consider a lease.  However, government approval was necessary, and 
any such transfer would have to be consistent with laws applicable 
to leases of government equipment.  Because the helicopters had just 
been purchased, a sale would not be considered.  Jankuloska said it 
would take 10-15 days to consider whether the GoM was willing and 
legally able to lease helicopters. 
 
¶3.  Macedonia has been a strong supporter of peace and stability 
operations, including in Afghanistan.  Macedonian contributions have 
been primarily military, but the Ministry of Interior is seeking to 
provide assistance in the area of civilian policing as well. 
Jankuloska wrote Ambassador Reeker on June 1 expressing her 
Ministry's interest in joining efforts to improve policing in 
Afghanistan.  In particular, the MoI has fifteen police officers 
with various skill sets who have been trained to take part in 
international missions.  Although the GoM has approached potential 
European partners seeking inclusion in civilian policing missions, 
Macedonia has not been invited to join any. 
 
¶4.  Post requests that Department provide information on any 
opportunities to partner with U.S. civilian policing missions in 
Afghanistan, or other international partners that may prove to be 
the "right fit" with whom Macedonians to partner.
