REF: A. STATE 20173 (B) STATE 36548 (C) ACCRA 485 
 
  ¶1.   (U)  The Ambassador spoke with Ghanaian Foreign 
Minister Nana Akufo-Addo March 8 and raised ref A points 
regarding support for Guatemala,s candidacy as Latin 
America,s next non-permanent member of the UNSC. 
Akufo-Addo quickly stated that the GOG would support 
Guatemala and asked when the vote would occur.  Ambassador 
replied in October. 
 
¶2.   (U)  Per ref B, Ambassador presented U.S. position on 
blue hatting African Union forces in Sudan, as a follow-up to 
a diplomatic note on the subject sent to the MFA on March 8. 
The Foreign Minister said that the AU,s Peace and Security 
Mission would meet on Friday,  March 10, to discuss this 
issue.  He said that the Sudanese were being difficult about 
the matter, but he expected the consensus would be for blue 
hatting.  Ambassador urged Ghana to push within AU 
deliberations to blue hat for reasons outlined (Ref B), and 
reminded the Minister that President Kufuor told CODEL 
Pelosi  (Ref C) that Ghana supports president Bush,s 
position on the Sudanese blue hatting.  Akufo-Addo promised 
to do so. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Comment:  Ghana broke with African consensus on 
Iran and IAEA, but felt it had to stand with the AU candidate 
on ICAO for the fist round vote even after Presidential 
pledges to support the U.S.. candidate.  Hopefully Ghana,s 
ambitions to chair the AU next time around will not cloud its 
thinking on re-hatting of AMIS.  End comment.
