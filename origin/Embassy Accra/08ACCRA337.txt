(SBU) Pol Chief delivered reftel demarche March 11 to Bernard 
Amoh, MFA Acting Director for the Middle East and Asia, 
stressing that the USG is particularly urging UNIFIL troop 
contributing countries such as Ghana to attend the March 14 
Convention to demonstrate support for Lebanon's sovereignty 
and democracy.  Amoh said that while Ghana sympathized with 
the expressed goals, it does not have an Embassy in Beirut 
and would therefore not be able to attend the convention.
