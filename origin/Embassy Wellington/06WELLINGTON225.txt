NONPROLIFERATION SEMINAR IN SINGAPORE 
 
REF: A. RICCI-HADDA 3/22 E-MAILS (NOTAL) 
 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 40458 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On March 23, Pol-Econ Counselor received a call 
from Caroline McDonald, Director of the Disarmament Division 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  McDonald said 
that regretfully, after much consideration she had decided 
that no one from MFAT would be able to attend the Singapore 
ARF non-proliferation seminar.  New Zealand's High Commission 
staff in Singapore will attend some of the sessions, but will 
not be able to make the presentation requested. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  The Disarmament Division is really 
strapped at the moment, even by tiny MFAT's standards.  The 
Deputy Director was recently reassigned and has not yet been 
replaced.  Another officer will transfer out of the now 
four-person office next month; her replacement has not yet 
been named.   End Comment.
