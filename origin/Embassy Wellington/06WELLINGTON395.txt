¶3. Begin statement by Foreign Minister Peters: 
 
The formation of a new government in Iraq after months of 
negotiations is a crucial step in the democratic process, Foreign 
Minister Winston Peters said today. 
 
"I congratulate Prime Minister Nouri Maliki and his colleagues on 
persevering over many months with forming a representative list of 
Cabinet members," Mr Peters said. 
 
The process of identifying ministers for the new Iraqi Government 
has taken five months, and followed the election of an Iraqi 
parliament - the Council of Representatives - as provided for by the 
new Iraqi constitution. 
 
The new Cabinet was approved by the Council of Representatives over 
the weekend. 
 
"This opens up for Iraq the possibility of a positive future and I 
welcome the formation of the new government. Now its job will be to 
try to make that future become a reality." 
 
Iraq continues to face severe challenges in terms of internal 
security and in securing an economic foundation for the future. 
Problems remain in ensuring even the basis necessities of life are 
provided for many. 
 
"Iraq's security challenges are partly reflected in the fact that 
appointees to the security, interior and defence portfolios have yet 
to be found. 
 
"It is vital to find the right people for these jobs and I wish Mr 
Maliki well in his ongoing talks," said Mr Peters. 
 
End statement.
