In response to State 61286, Embassy contacted New Zealand's 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's (MFAT) Janet Lowe, Acting 
Director of the Environment Division to ascertain GNZ's reaction to 
the U.S.'s proposed participation in the International Renewable 
Energy Agency (IRENA).  Lowe thanked us for sharing U.S. views and 
intentions on IRENA. She said, GNZ officials are tracking IRENA 
with "close interest" and are recommending a review of their 
current "no join" position to relevant Ministers. Lowe confirmed 
that New Zealand was invited to participate in the June 28-30 IRENA 
meeting in Egypt and that Ambassador Rene Wilson (NZ Ambassador 
Cairo) will attend as their observer.  In response to our 
questions, Lowe indicated that GNZ as a non-member has not yet 
formulated an official position on the location of the 
Headquarters, the nationality of the Director-General or IRENA's 
potential mission. Post will forward any additional information 
should MFAT's position change or develop in the near-term.
