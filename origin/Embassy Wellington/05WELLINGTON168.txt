SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND VIEWS ON THE FUTURE OF UNMISET 
 
REF: SECSTATE 24208 
 
¶1.  According to an official at New Zealand's Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), New Zealand agrees that the 
time has come to wrap up peacekeeping operations in East 
Timor.  New Zealand believes UNMISET should be replaced by a 
scaled-down, time-bound political mission under UN auspices, 
along the lines of existing UN political missions.  MFAT 
officials believe this is the best way to balance East 
Timor's capacity-building needs with its need to protect 
still-fragile institutions and sectors. 
 
¶2.  New Zealand's own possible aid to East Timor will 
probably be managed by NZAID, the government's 
AID-equivalent.  New Zealand's bilateral assistance program 
for East Timor is set to expand soon, as New Zealand will in 
the near future change its consulate in Dili to an Embassy. 
At this point, however, no decisions have been made on what 
sort of assistance to provide.  Our contact said that a 
previous offer by New Zealand to help train police officers 
was rejected by East Timor officials, as the New Zealand 
trainers spoke no Portuguese.  New Zealand will wait to see 
what comes out of the UNSC meeting before making any 
decisions whether to provide funds for UNDP programs in East 
Timor.
