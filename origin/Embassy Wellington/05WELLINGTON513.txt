¶1. (SBU) Embassy passed reftel message and talking points 
to New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(MFAT) Disarmament Division on April 26, 2005.  Dell 
Higgie, Director of MFAT's Security Policy Division and 
Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism responded in a letter 
that the embassy received on June 28, 2005. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In the letter, Ambassador Higgie informs that as 
part of the New Zealand Government's Proliferation 
Security Initiative (PSI) outreach activities, MFAT has 
posted information about PSI on its website 
(http://www.mfat.govt.nz/foreign/spd/psi/psi. html), 
outlining its purpose and the benefits of New Zealand's 
participation in the initiative. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ambassador Higgie also included with the letter a 
newsletter on counter-terrorism that included information 
on the PSI, which was prepared for senior security 
officials in Pacific Island countries, and which was 
distributed at the inaugural meeting of the Pacific 
Islands Forum Working Group on Counter-Terrorism that took 
place in Auckland in June.  We are faxing a copy of the 
newsletter to EAP/ANP. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Ambassador Higgie comments that "as our Pacific 
Forum-wide counter-terrorism exercise rolls out over the 
coming months, we will be looking for further 
opportunities to raise the profile of PSI with our 
regional neighbors."  She has said she will keep us 
informed of any developments.
