SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND REPORTS LITTLE TO NO EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE 
IN TONGA 
 
 ¶1. New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(MFAT) reports there have been no casualties and little to no 
property damage in the capital of Nuku'alofa and the outer 
islands.  MFAT says the Tongan National Emergency-Disaster 
Office reports no casualties and little to no property damage 
in Ha'apai, the island nearest to the epicenter. There have 
been no reports of structural damage. 
 
¶2. The NZ High Commissioner to Tonga, Michael McBride, 
reported broken plates at his residence sustained from the 
prolonged, 30-second quake and an initial overloading of the 
phone system in Nuku'alofa.  However, McBride said the social 
situation had returned to normal, with locals playing touch 
rugby in the street.  Initial situation reports from New 
Zealand's missions to Apia, Cook Islands and Niue were 
similar, reporting no casualties and little to no property 
damage.  As the earthquake has apparently had little impact, 
GNZ plans no special assistance to the region at this time.
