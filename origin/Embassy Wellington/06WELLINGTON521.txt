¶1. Following instructions in reftel, post contacted Steven Johnson, 
director of Heli Cam Aviation Limited.  Johnson confirmed that he 
has received an R44 Raven II helicopter, manufactured by Robinson 
Helicopter Company, with gyro stabilization equipment installed. 
 
¶2. Johnson said that possession, operation and security of the 
helicopter remain under his control.  The helicopter is parked in a 
hangar at Ardmore Airfield in South Auckland, New Zealand.  One 
other company has access to the hangar. 
 
¶3. Johnson confirmed that the helicopter is being used for 
broadcasting by commercial television stations, as well as by other 
customers for taking photographs from the air.  His clients include 
Radio New Zealand and Bayleys real estate agency.  Keith Slater, 
Auckland bureau chief of TV3 broadcasting station, confirmed that he 
has flown in Heli Cam's helicopter and seen the stabilization 
equipment in operation. 
 
¶4. Johnson said he is familiar with restrictions regarding the 
transfer or re-export of U.S. Munitions List articles.  He 
understands that he must seek U.S. Department of State permission 
before transferring or selling the gyro stabilization equipment (or 
the helicopter with the equipment installed). 
 
¶5. Johnson said he began Heli Cam Aviation three to four months ago, 
after reading about such a helicopter service in the United Kingdom 
and studying the market in New Zealand.  His company has one 
helicopter, the R44 Raven II.  Johnson is a former member of the New 
Zealand air force and most recently worked as a marine engineer.  He 
learned how to fly a helicopter about three years ago. 
 
¶6. Johnson's company is located at DeHavilland Lane, Ardmore 
Airfield, South Auckland, New Zealand; its website is 
www.helicam.co.nz.  Johnson's cellular telephone number is 
64-21-844-059; his home number is 64-9-268-0308. 
 
¶7. Based on the information gathered, post believes the company to 
be a reliable recipient of USML items.
