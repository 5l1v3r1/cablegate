¶2. (C) On May 15, Poloff delivered reftel invitation to 
Valerie Meyer; Deputy Director; United Nations, Human Rights, 
and Commonwealth Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and

relay the invitation to Gerard van Bohemen, MFAT's 
International Legal Advisor.

Division will likewise find it difficult to attend the 
conference, but requested further clarification about the 
conference before making a final decision. 
 
¶4. (C) Post requests Department assistance in responding to 
the following questions from van Bohemen: 
 
-- What will be the focus of the conference discussion?  Is 
it legally-focused or is it looking to establish some kind of 
early warning system? 
 
-- Is the intention to focus on avoiding the social and 
economic circumstances that might give rise to such 
atrocities? 
 
-- If a Wellington-based GNZ official is unable to attend, 
would representation from NZ's Embassy in Washington be 
acceptable?
