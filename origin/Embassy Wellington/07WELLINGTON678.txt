group an overview of his estimate of what is happening in the war on 
terror; his view of Al-Qaeda, and what has happened to the movement; 
where the trouble spots are; what can be done to counter terrorism; 
and an assessment of the success of the war on terror.

for thirty years. He is currently a tenured professor in the 
Security Studies Program at Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh 
School of Foreign Service, Washington, DC. Professor Hoffman 
previously held the Corporate Chair in Counterterrorism and 
Counterinsurgency at the RAND Corporation and was also Director of 
RAND's Washington, DC Office. In 2004 he also was Acting Director of 
RAND's Center for Middle East Public Policy. Professor Hoffman was 
adviser on counterterrorism to the Office of National Security 
Affairs, Coalition Provisional Authority, Baghdad, Iraq during the 
spring of 2004 and from 2004-2005 was an adviser on 
counterinsurgency to the Strategy, Plans, and Analysis Office at 
Multi-National Forces-Iraq Headquarters, Baghdad. He was also an
