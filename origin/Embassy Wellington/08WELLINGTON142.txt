SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE REGARDING TURKEY 
CHANGE OF STATUS AT THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION 
AND DEVELOPMENT (EBRD). 
 
REF: SECSTATE 41999 
 
In response to reftel, Louisa Gault policy officer in the 
European Division of New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFAT) informed Embassy that MFAT has not yet developed a 
formal position on Turkey's request to change membership 
status with respect to the mandate of the EBRD.  Despite the 
lack of a formal position, MFAT remains open to the plan 
proposed by the United States and would not oppose it. 
However, MFAT remains cautious that it (the U.S. plan) may 
mean that members could loose the opportunity to undertake a 
wholesale review of the EBRD mandate that has been slated for 
the Capital Resources Review 4 in 2010. Per Gault, "we think 
that this 2010 review is important as the timescale for U.S 
review is very short."  Any additional information that State 
or Treasury could offer to address MFAT's concern would help 
further ensure GNZ support.
