 ¶1.  (SBU)  Pol/Econ Counselor met with Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade (MFAT Director of the Americas Division 
Carl Worker on October 31 and discussed the Community of 
Democracies meeting in Bamako in mid-November as well as GNZ 
participation in the Asia Pacific Democracy Partnership 
(APDP).  Worker related that the GNZ would most likely not be 
attending the session in Mali.  New Zealand's Ministry and 
NZAID staff are limited and there are other pressing trips. 
Moreover, New Zealand lacks missions in Africa who might 
cover the meetings.  The GNZ has also not yet made a final 
decision on joining the APDP, and will welcome the readout of 
discussions in Mali aimed at providing greater clarification 
to the initiative's objectives and proposed areas of 
engagement within the region.  New Zealand would also 
appreciate knowing where other Asian countries -- 
particularly Indonesia, Japan, and Korea stand on 
participation.  Worker underscored that New Zealand wants to 
be forward leaning on the APDP, but the Americas Division 
would appreciate greater detail on the APDP before sending 
the proposal forward for Minister Peter's decision.
