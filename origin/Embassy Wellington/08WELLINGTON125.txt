SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND REQUEST FOR SSI U.S. SPEAKER ON U.S. 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS - OCTOBER 2008 
 
¶1. MSP Theme: MSP Goal 08-01 Mutual Understanding. 
Description/Purpose: There are close ties between the countries in 
this region; at the same time there is also a high level of interest 
in U.S. politics, which is reflected daily in the New Zealand media. 
 New Zealand requests support for a second SSI speaker on the 2008 
presidential elections. We seek someone who can discuss the 
electoral process, the electoral landscape, the key candidates and 
their policies, and the factors that will decide the result. It is 
also expected that the speaker will be able to discuss the outcome 
the elections may have for USG policies, especially on climate 
change, the rise of China, the Middle East situation, trade and 
investment issues, and U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
 
¶2. This visit would also build on the serious interest there is in 
New Zealand presently on the U.S. elections and the recent visit of 
Professor Roger Davidson. 
 
¶3. Time-frame and number of days: We propose a minimum of 10 program 
days in the region, plus travel that could include visits to 
Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, and PNG or Asian cities in the region 
(Manila, Tokyo, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur) from the first week of 
October onwards. 
 
¶4. Specialist required: Please note: Incoming PAO Mark Wenig 
(WenigML@state.gov) has been in touch with Terry Michael, who has 
confirmed his availability for this program should funds be 
available. Post requests this Speaker using FY09 funds. 
 
Note also that Wenig has experience with Mr. Michael, both at his 
present post (Leipzig, where he has been both a speaker and a DVC 
participant, both times with groups of journalists) and at his 
previous post (Bucharest, where he was a traveling speaker). Wenig 
gives Michael the highest recommendation for his expert analyses and 
his impartiality. 
 
¶5. Audience: Parliamentarians, government officials, private sector, 
NGOs, students, academics, news media, members of the NZ Institute 
of International Affairs, and the general public.
