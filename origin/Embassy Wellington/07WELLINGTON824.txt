 ¶1.  (SBU)  On November 20, Pol/Econ Counselor met with the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) Deputy Director 
of the Americas Division, Paul Willis, to discuss the issues 
regarding Venezuela and upcoming developments related to the 
country's constitution.  While recognizing that Venezuela 
does not have diplomatic representation in New Zealand 
(Venezuela's Embassy in Canberra also covers New Zealand), 
Pol/Econ Counselor noted USG concerns regarding the future of 
democracy in Venezuela.  Willis agreed that the situation in 
Venezuela bore watching.  New Zealand exports milk products 
to Venezuela, and their bilateral relationship is primarily 
centered on the dairy trade, with Mexico and Cuba being other 
major importers of New Zealand milk products.  Willis said 
that the GNZ's primary focus on Venezuela's foreign policy in 
the region is focused on Venezuela's potential influence on 
Pacific Island countries, noting that Venezuela had been an 
observer during the recent Pacific Islands Forum (PIF). 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Willis said that his office would welcome further 
opportunities to exchange information on Venezuela with the 
Embassy.
