¶1.  Roy Ferguson, Americas Desk Director at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), called post today to convey 
GNZ condolences at the loss of life and devastation caused by 
Hurricane Katrina.  He said GNZ stands ready to help in any 
way as needed, noting that in the past NZ firefighters have 
for example helped fight US forest fires.  He also said the 
Prime Minister would be writing to the President to express 
condolences. 
 
¶2.  Post has also received numerous phone calls from New 
Zealanders expressing concern and offering assistance.  We 
have directed MFAT and other callers to FEMA's website.  We 
have also shared with MFAT the Department's guidance about 
assisting third country national callers seeking contact with 
those in affected areas.
