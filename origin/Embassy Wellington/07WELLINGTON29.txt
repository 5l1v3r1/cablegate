REF: CANBERRA 00038 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy Wellington welcomes and grants clearances 
for Canberra Legal Attache Gregory B. Groves to travel to 
Rarotonga, Cook Islands from January 17-20, 2007. The purpose 
of this visit is to meet with representatives from the Cook 
Islands Police Service and provide information on any 
training needs that the police service may require. 
 
¶2. (U) Embassy understands that country clearance is the only 
assistance required and that lodging and transportation have 
already been secured. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Embassy point of contact is RSO James Doherty. 
Contact details are as follows: 
 
Office: 644-462-6013 
Fax:    644-462-6070 
Cell:   027-451-2537 
Email:  dohertyjp@state.gov 
 
¶4. (SBU) Security Assessment -- The Cook Islands is a 
Parliamentary democracy in free association with New Zealand, 
on which they rely for defense and assistance in meeting 
low-level security threats. The Embassy is not aware of any 
specific threats to U.S. facilities or personnel at this time 
in the Cook Islands. However, in light of the worldwide 
security alert, all visitors should heighten their security 
awareness and report any unusual incidents to the Regional 
Security Office at the Embassy in Wellington, New Zealand 
(64-4-462-6000). 
 
(SBU) Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in 
the U.S. and the 2002 and 2005 terrorist bombings in Bali, 
there has been concern that terrorists might seek to take 
advantage of the low level of security maintained in small 
island states such as the Cook Islands in order to target 
tourists in previously safe destinations. New Zealand has 
worked with the Cook Islands to improve airport security in 
response to this possibility. 
 
(U) As a result of recent military action in Iraq, there is a 
potential for retaliatory actions to be taken against U.S. 
citizens and interests throughout the world. Public 
demonstrations carry the potential for precipitating violence 
directed at American citizens. 
 
(SBU) U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain at a 
hightened state of alert and some have drawn down their 
dependents and/or personnel. These facilities may temporarily 
close or suspend public services from time to time due to 
security reasons. In those instances, U.S. embassies and 
consulates will make every effort to provide emergency 
services to American citizens. Monitor the local news and 
maintain contact with the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. 
 
¶5. (U) Crime -- Appropriate common sense precautions should 
be taken, especially at night, to avoid becoming an easy 
target opportunity for pickpockets and thieves. 
 
¶6. (U) Weather -- Severe cyclones present a threat during the 
hurricane season; however, this is generally only from 
November to March.
