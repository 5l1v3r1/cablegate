REF: STATE 76746 
 
 ¶1.  In response to reftel request, Econoff conducted a site 
visit of Custom Aeronautical Support (CAS) located in 
Christchurch on August 26 and met with company director Greg 
Gaba and sales manager Emma Niu.  CAS is physically located 
in a relatively small but modern and secure building in an 
industrial park outside Christchurch. CAS has been at this 
location since 2005. The facility consists of a 
well-organized warehouse holding spare airplane and 
helicopter parts along with an office consisting of five 
full-time employees. Records are keep both electronically and 
in paper files and are well organized. CAS primarily deals in 
supplying spare parts to small to medium size commercial 
aircraft in New Zealand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakastain and 
Taiwan. CAS developed a business relationship with Aerospace 
Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) in Taiwan to supply 
spare parts for Fokker aircraft used by Taiwan Air Force. 
 
¶2.  AIDC approached CAS and asked company if it could supply 
13 ea. SHIM (part no. 16L401-21). CAS does not normally stock 
this item so it contacted MAC Aerospace Corp. in Chantilly VA 
as a source for the part. MAC consigned the shipment to Union 
Transport Inc. (UTI) located at Carson Town Center, Los 
Angeles, California on April 3, 2008. According to Mr. Gaba 
and Ms. Niu of CAS, the parts were shipped direct from UTI in 
Los Angeles to AIDC in Taiwan for use by the Taiwan Air 
Force. There were no shipments to nor storage in Christchurch 
facility. CAS has provided Econoff with copies of invoices, 
payments and shipping records of the transaction which will 
be emailed seperately to the PM/DTTC Blue Lantern 
coordinator. CAS acknowledges that it does not have extensive 
experience in purchasing items on restricted United States 
Munitions List but expressed its intent to cooperate fully 
with requirements and said they would happily seek guidance 
for future purchases and shipments. Please let Embassy know 
if there is any additional information which may be helpful 
in satisfying this Blue Lantern request.
