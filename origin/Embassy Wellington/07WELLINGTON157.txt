Security Assessment 
------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Cook Islands is a Parliamentary democracy in free 
association with New Zealand, on which they rely for defense and 
assistance in meeting low-level security threats.  The Embassy is 
not aware of any specific threats to U.S. facilities or personnel at 
this time in the Cook Islands.  However, in light of the worldwide 
security alert all visitors should heighten their security awareness 
and report any unusual incidents to the Regional Security Office at 
the Embassy in Wellington, New Zealand (telephone (64)(4)462-6000, 
24 hours/day). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the 
U.S. and the 2002 and 2005 terrorist bombings in Bali, there has 
been concern that terrorists might seek to take advantage of the low 
level of security maintained in small island states such as the Cook 
Islands in order to target tourists in previously safe destinations. 
 New Zealand has worked with the Cook Islands to improve airport 
security in response to this possibility. 
 
¶5.  (U) As a result of recent military action in Iraq, there is a 
potential for retaliatory actions to be taken against U.S. citizens 
and interests throughout the world.  Public demonstrations carry the 
potential for precipitating violence directed at American citizens. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain at a 
heightened state of alert and some have drawn down their dependents 
and/or personnel.  These facilities may temporarily close or suspend 
public services from time to time for security reasons.  In those 
instances, U.S. embassies and consulates will make every effort to 
provide emergency services to American citizens.  Monitor the local 
news and maintain contact with the nearest American Embassy or U.S. 
Consulate. 
 
¶7.  (U) Crime:  Appropriate common sense precautions should be 
taken, especially at night, to avoid becoming a target of 
opportunity. 
 
¶8.  (U) Weather:  Severe cyclones present a threat during the 
hurricane season; however, this is generally only from November to 
March.
