SUBJECT:  NEW ZEALAND COUNTRY CLEARANCE FOR TRANSPORTATION 
SECURITY ADMINISTRATION REPRESENTATIVE SCOTTIE LAIRD, AUGUST 
23-27, 2004 
 
REF:  SYDNEY 00801 
 
¶1.  Embassy welcomes and grants country clearance to Mr. 
Scottie Laird, Transportation Security Administration 
Representative (TSAR), to travel to Auckland and 
Christchurch, New Zealand from September 23 - 27, 2004.  The 
purpose of this visit is to assess airport security 
measures. 
 
¶2.  Embassy understands that no further assistance is 
required. 
 
¶3.  Embassy point of contact is Economic officer Joy 
Yamamoto. 
Contact details are as follows: 
Office:  644-462-6182 
Fax:     644-472-3537 
Cell:    027-446-4467 
E-mail:  yamamotojo@state.gov 
 
¶4.  Visitors should use local taxi service, which is 
generally safe, reliable and frequent.  In Auckland, taxi 
fare is approximately NZD60 from the airport to downtown. 
In Christchurch, the fare is approximately NZ35. 
 
¶5. Travelers can exchange currency at the airport upon 
arrival and ATM machines are readily available throughout 
New Zealand. 
 
¶6.  Biosecurity Fines: 
 
The government of New Zealand instituted fines for non- 
declared biosecurity hazards on travelers entering New 
Zealand with undeclared plant, animal or food material. 
Travelers found carrying these undeclared items will be 
immediately fined NZ$200 (US $150).  Biosecurity is a 
serious issue in New Zealand and fines will be administered 
immediately and without warnings. 
 
¶7.  Security Assessment: 
 
a.  There are no local terrorist groups or support groups 
believed to be operating in New Zealand at this time.  In 
light of the worldwide security alert all visitors should 
heighten their security awareness and report any unusual 
incidents to the regional security office. 
 
b.  Anonymous telephonic threats and obscure threat mail 
have occasionally targeted U.S. diplomatic missions in New 
Zealand.  In response to U.S. policies and actions, various 
groups in New Zealand have demonstrated occasionally at the 
embassy in Wellington and at the consulate in Auckland. 
These demonstrations were of a small scale and were 
peacefully conducted.  During these demonstrations, the host 
country police and protective services provided adequate 
protection to the embassy and consulate. 
 
c.  While New Zealand is considered a low threat crime 
environment, Wellington and Auckland have experienced an 
increase in violent and petty crimes.  Home invasion 
robberies and assaults, once very rare, are becoming more 
frequent.  Burglaries and thefts occur countrywide. 
Visitors should be aware that street crime is a daily 
occurrence in the larger cities, including Wellington and 
Auckland.  Common sense precautions should be taken, 
especially at night, to avoid becoming a target of 
opportunity. 
 
d.  All forms of public transportation are generally safe at 
all times of the day.
