REF: A. STATE 112194 
     ¶B. STATE 128260 
 
¶1. (SBU) On July 13, Post delivered ref A points to Chris 
Ford, Manager Security, Civilian Aviation Authority of New 
Zealand, and Megan Beecroft and Nigel Mouat, Ministry of 
Transportation.  On August 10, Ford told Post that GNZ 
concurs with the USG views expressed in ref A, saying that 
GNZ "does not see as appropriate x-raying of the diplomatic 
pouch, and New Zealand's supporting regulations do not allow 
it."  "It should not be the role of an aviation security 
panel to interpret the Vienna Convention," Ford added, 
"rather it is a matter for an international jurist and not a 
technical group." 
 
¶2. (SBU) GNZ will support USG views at the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Avian Security (AVSEC) 
Panel in Montreal in September, where Ford will be head of 
the New Zealand delegation.
