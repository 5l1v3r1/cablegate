SUBJECT: FY2006 U.S. Speaker Request -- Ambassador 
Charles Salmon 
 
 
¶1. Program Description: In Support of MPP Goal 06-01, 
Active Anti-Terrorist Coalitions and Security, Post 
requests a U.S. speaker visit by Ambassador Charles 
Salmon (ret.), Asia Pacific Center for Security Studies, 
Honolulu, Hawaii.  We have received a request from one of 
New Zealand's leading universities for a keynote speaker 
for the New Zealand Army Leadership Conference in 
November.  We would like Ambassador Salmon to address the 
demands of leadership in complex environments. 
 
Allowing for a rest day and Embassy briefings in 
Wellington, we would like Ambassador Salmon to arrive in 
Wellington on or about Monday, 21 November, and depart 
Auckland for Honolulu on Sunday, 27 November.  This would 
allow for a maximum of four official program days and two 
rest days. 
 
¶2. Date, Fiscal Year and Quarter: Dates: 21-27 November, 
¶2005. Fiscal Year 2006; First Quarter. 
 
¶3. Justification and Objective: Ambassador Salmon's 
experience as a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army, his 
Naval War College background, his Presidential Award for 
Meritorious Service, the Department of Defense 
Distinguished Civilian Service Medal, and his knowledge 
of foreign policy, specifically as it relates to the Asia- 
Pacific area, make him ideally suited to come to New 
Zealand and present at this conference. 
 
Post is of the opinion that a speaker of his caliber 
would attract a broad range of official, academic, and 
media interest.   His knowledge of the Asia-Pacific 
region would also provide Post with an opportunity for 
discussion of Pacific issues with New Zealand contacts. 
 
¶4. Program contact Christine Vivian has already 
approached Ambassador Salmon, who has confirmed his 
serious interest with enthusiasm and also his 
availability to visit New Zealand at this time. 
 
¶5. Audience: It is anticipated that this program will 
include members of parliament and their staffs, 
academics, the media, and local branches of the New 
Zealand Institute of International Affairs in at least 
two university cities. 
 
¶6. Topics and Types of Events: Ambassador Salmon will be 
asked to attend embassy briefings in Wellington. Speech 
topics are to be decided in consultation with him. It is 
envisaged that there will be a presentation to embassy 
contacts in Wellington and other events to include 
meetings with political leaders, the media, academia, and 
representational events and presentations to NZIIA (New 
Zealand Institute of International Affairs) members.
