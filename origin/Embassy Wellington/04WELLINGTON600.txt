Â¶1. (SBU) Post delivered reftel demarche to Rachel Bennett, 
United Nations Division, New Zealand Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade (MFAT.)  Bennett offered to circulate the 
information within MFAT for comment, but noted that the GoNZ 
is unlikely to provide additional proposals or a list or 
priorities in advance of the 59th UNGA.  Bennett agreed with 
Poloff that this allowed other countries to set the agenda, 
but pointed out that New Zealand had a "fluid" approach to 
the UNGA and valued its flexibility in addressing specific 
resolutions and issues.
