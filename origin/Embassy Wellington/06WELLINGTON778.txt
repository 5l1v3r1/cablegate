¶1. (C) In response to reftels, CDA Keegan delivered 
talking points this afternoon to John McKinnon, Deputy 
Secretary at New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
 
SIPDIS 
and Trade (MFAT) accompanied by Brian Sanders Deputy 
Director of the North Asia Division at MFAT. McKinnon 
said he agreed with resuming six party talks and with 
the need for UNSC to reiterate the demand for North 
Korea to conform to UN resolution 1695.  McKinnon 
informed CDA that New Zealand's Minister of Foreign 
Affairs (NZMF) Winston Peters is writing a strong 
communiquQ to both the Chinese and North Korean (DPRK) 
governments.  Sanders promised to share a copy of the 
text as soon as the Minister approves it. The essence of 
the message to China is to maintain its efforts and 
continue to engage North Korea on nuclear issue. Peters' 
message to DPRK is to urge them to conform to UN 1695. 
McKinnon said that the request to support 5 5 meetings 
comes as news but he expects believes that NZMF will 
support. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) McKinnon noted that Minister Peters had made a 
strong press statement wherein he stated that North 
Korea's announced plans for a nuclear weapons test was 
"intolerable."  Peters went on to say, "if this threat 
is carried out, North Korea can expect a harsh response 
from the international community." "Repercussions will 
undoubtedly be stronger than those following North 
Korea's missile test in July." Peters urged North Korea 
to return to dialogue at the earliest possible 
opportunity. (Minister's statement has bee faxed to 
EAP/ANP).
