¶1. (SBU)  Summary.  The Government of New Zealand has confirmed that 
it cannot send a representative to the Development Ministers Meeting 
to be held in Monrovia, Liberia September 5-6.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  In response to Reftel request regarding host nation 
participation in the Development Ministers Meeting  to be held in 
Monrovia, Liberia September 5-6, Post reached out to the New Zealand 
Agency for International Development (NZAID) and have been informed 
that it did receive the August 12 invitation from Liberian President 
Sirleaf to attend the meeting.  However, Peter Adams, Executive 
Director NZAID, cannot attend the meeting nor can any other GNZ 
official.  New Zealand has sparse diplomatic coverage on the African 
continent - it has missions in Cairo and Pretoria only.  Therefore, 
it is constrained by a shortfall in available personnel at this 
time.
