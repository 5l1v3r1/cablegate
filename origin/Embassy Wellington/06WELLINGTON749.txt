SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER REITERATES HER PRAISE FOR 
EMBASSY CULTURAL PROGRAM. 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark has publicly 
underscored her appreciation of the US State Department's 
contribution to fostering people-to-people cultural links. The PM 
made special mention of a reception at the Ambassador's residence 
that was a strategic use of Public Affairs grant and 
representational funds. The significance of these brief words in the 
context of the larger congratulatory speech should not be 
overlooked. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. On Friday night, September 22, Prime Minister Helen Clark. 
launched the music CD, "View From Olympus," by New Zealand composer 
John Psathas. This work features American saxophonist Joshua Redman 
as soloist. 
 
In her congratulatory speech to the influential audience of 
government representatives, diplomats, cultural leaders, and 
sponsors the Prime Minister said, "In May of this year I was able to 
learn more about this extraordinary project when the United States 
ambassador hosted Joshua Redman and me for a reception following 
that day's recording." 
 
These brief words convey a significant message for the bilateral 
relationship. The final production featured artists from the United 
States, Portugal, and New Zealand; but American Ambassador William 
McCormick was the only diplomat to be mentioned.  The Prime 
Minister's acknowledgement of the American ambassador's contribution 
to this project was both complimentary and appreciative. 
 
¶3. New Zealand composer John Psathas is much admired by the New 
Zealand Prime Minister, who cultural  is also the Minister for Arts, 
Culture, and Heritage and appreciates the role the arts plays in 
expressing New Zealand's culture and national spirit.  With this 
(and the fact that Joshua Redman is a leading American saxophonist) 
in mind, Public Affairs provided a grant in support of Redman's 
visit.  Additionally, the Ambassador hosted a reception for key 
embassy contacts to celebrate the recording.  We invited PM Helen 
Clark, and for the first time as Prime Minister (7 years!) she came 
to the ambassador's residence. Her experience at this event, which 
celebrated the artistic collaboration between an American musician 
and a New Zealand composer, was very positive.  The Prime Minister 
stayed much longer than anticipated, and by the evening's conclusion 
the she was very relaxed and communicating well with the ambassador 
and other American officers. 
 
¶4. Following this (also for the first time as Prime Minister), PM 
Helen Clark accepted Ambassador McCormick's invitation to attend the 
American Embassy's Fourth of July reception. In his speech 
recognizing the year's achievements, the ambassador thanked the 
Prime Minister for attending the "wrap-up party" for Joshua Redman's 
recording of Psathas' Saxophone concerto. 
 
In her reply, the PM emphasized the friendship between New Zealand 
and the United States and the benefits of the many areas the two 
countries have in common. And now, this past Friday, September 22, 
she referred to the ambassador's support of John's Psathas' project 
in her launch of the completed recordings. 
 
¶5. Post is pleased that the initial grant and reception initiated by 
Public Affairs generated a bridge of mutual appreciation shared by 
Prime Minister Clark and Ambassador McCormick and that the program 
had such a lasting impact.  Public Affairs is pleased that our 
emphasis on the strategic use of grants and representational funds 
has enabled Post to achieve this valuable step towards greater 
bilateral appreciation and common interest.
