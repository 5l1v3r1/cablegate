¶1.   In response to reftel, PolOff conducted a Blue Lantern post 
shipment check of Helicopters Otago, Ltd on September 10, 2009. 
This helicopter rescue company is a legitimate business operating 
under contract with the New Zealand government's Accident 
Compensation Corporation, and it has land and sea rescue 
responsibility for the southern half of New Zealand's south island. 
PolOff witnessed a signed contract and a current business license. 
 
 
 
¶2.  Helicopters Otago, Ltd is home-based in Dunedin, NZ and has 
been in business for 20 years.  Graeme Gale is its sole proprietor. 
This company uses night vision devices (nvd) primarily for night 
rescue and medical evacuation operations over land.  Management 
understands the restrictions on United States Munitions List items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer and 
re-export. 
 
 
 
¶3.  All nvds are kept in a safe within a locked facility when not 
in use, and only pilots and paramedics who are trained to use them 
have access to the safe.  PolOff inspected the Dunedin facility and 
verified that six ITT Model F4949F, Gen III ANVIS 9 Aviator Night 
Vision Goggles (serial numbers:  25252, 25251, 21620, 21621, 11922, 
and 11925) plus associated hardware were present. 
 
 
 
¶4.  Helicopters Otago is the only civilian ITT certified 
calibration site in New Zealand, so nvds are sent to Dunedin from 
around the country for 180 day calibrations.
