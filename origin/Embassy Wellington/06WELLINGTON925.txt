SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND: DEMARCHE DELIVERED ON BAMAKO 
CONFERENCE ON AVIAN AND PANDEMIC INFLUENZA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 190899 
 
(U) On November 24, Poloff delivered to Peter Noble; Deputy 
Director; United Nations, Human Rights and Commonwealth 
Division; Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) reftel 
points regarding the fourth international conference on avian 
and pandemic influenza (API) in Bamako, Mali, December 6-8. 
Noble says he will share points with colleagues at the 
Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Forestry (MAF) and query them about GNZ representation in 
Bamako.  Because of limited staff and the travel distance 
involved, Noble said direct representation from Wellington 
appears unlikely.  However, GNZ may be able to send a 
representative from another post.  Embassy will advise 
Washington if and when a delegate is selected.
