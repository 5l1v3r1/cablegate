SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND THOUGHTS ON UNGA FISHERIES RESOLUTION 
AND BOTTOM TRAWLING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 137745 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: GNZ is developing its official policy on 
the UNGA fisheries resolution and bottom trawling but is 
likely to support our position.  GNZ is concerned that the 
UNGA and Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMOs) 
mandates may clash. Working level GNZ officials will provide 
more information on the GNZ position once it receives 
guidance from ministers, expected about September 10.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On August 25, Poloff delivered reftel text to Felicity 
Buchanan, Deputy Director, Environment Division, MFAT, and on 
August 29 joined her on a previously arranged conference call 
with David Hogan, OES/OMC. 
 
¶3. (U) Buchanan expressed appreciation for reftel points as a 
way to establish focus around the issue.  She said that 
MFAT's Environment Division is taking the lead on GNZ's 
preparations for UN discussions on bottom trawling, in 
coordination with the Ministry of Fisheries, Department of 
Conservation, New Zealand's International Development Agency 
(NZAID), and the Treasury.  They are aiming to get 
instructions from Ministers by September 10. 
 
¶3. (U) Buchanan noted that bottom trawling is on the notional 
agenda for the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting in 
October in Suva and the second meeting of the South Pacific 
Regional Fisheries Management Organization (SPRFMO) in Hobart 
in November.  GNZ is looking for a consistent position that 
does not conflict with the separate mandates of UNGA, the UN 
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the several 
regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs). 
 
¶4. (SBU) While there is still no official GNZ position, 
Buchanan predicted New Zealand would support the U.S. view. 
"New Zealand has been pretty vocal that the UN should do 
something about bottom trawling, and that RFMOs and Flag 
States should do something as well."  She said that New 
Zealand would be open to the idea of a timetable as well as 
an FAO role.  Buchanan also suggested that it might be less 
problematic for the UN to manage fisheries outside of the 
various RFMOs as there would clearly be no mandate overlap in 
that case. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Buchanan does not expect to be at UNGA in October, 
but plans to come to New York in November when she 
anticipates that the text will be negotiated.  She added that 
Jenny McIver, from the New Zealand Mission in New York, will 
represent New Zealand in at the October UNGA meeting.
