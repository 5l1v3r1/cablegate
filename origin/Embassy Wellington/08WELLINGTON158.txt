¶1. (SBU) In response to Reftel instruction, DCM contacted 
David Taylor, the Director of the Asia Division in New 
Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT). On 
May 7, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced that the New 
Zealand Government committed NZD 500,000 (USD 387,000) to New 
Zealand aid and relief agencies involved in Burma to assist 
them in responding to the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis. On May 
8, PM Clark committed an additional NZD 1 million (USD 
775,000) to UNICEF for its assistance in the wake of the 
cyclone. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Taylor, MFAT has instructed its embassy 
in Bangkok to express to the Burmese regime its strong 
concern about the delay in permitting international 
assistance and aid workers to enter the country. (NOTE. New 
Zealand does not have an embassy in Burma. END NOTE.) It has 
instructed its embassy in Canberra to convey the same message 
to the Burmese embassy there. Finally, MFAT has instructed 
the New Zealand delegation at the ARF SOM occurring this week 
in Singapore to raise the same concern with the Burmese 
delegation on the margins of the SOM. New Zealand will also 
express the same concern during the SOM plenary. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Taylor said that New Zealand would continue to watch 
developments closely and welcomed any further thoughts from 
Washington on how best to coordinate our responses.
