¶1. (U) New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(MFAT) has advised us by Diplomatic Note (para. 2) that MFAT 
will be closed for the Christmas and New Year holidays from 
December 23, 2006 to January 2, 2007.  This is a good 
reminder that many NZ officials will soon be taking off for 
Christmas and (antipodean) summer holidays.  As International 
Polar Year (IPY) and Antarctic 50th anniversary dates in 
January are approaching quickly, Embassy Wellington would 
emphasize the importance of providing final names and dates 
for the USG delegation to Antarctica and New Zealand, so that 
we can finalize arrangements for the group before GNZ leaves 
town. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin Note: 
 
Note number: 2006/43 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Wellington 
presents its compliments to the Diplomatic and Consular 
Missions accredited to New Zealand and has the honour to 
advise that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will 
close for the Christmas and New Year holidays from 23 
December 2006 to 2 January 2007 inclusive.  The Ministry will 
reopen on Wednesday 3 January 2007. 
 
The Ministry further advises that during the holiday period 
of 23 December 2006 to 2 January 2007 inclusive most 
government departments will also be closed.  The Ministry 
advises that due to staff absences in the week prior to the 
holiday period, the last day for receipt of requests for 
airport facilitation, replacement/new diplomatic 
identification cards or diplomatic exemption labels would be 
Monday 18 December 2006. 
 
If a mission/post requires emergency assistance between 23 
December 2006 and the evening of 2 January 2007, they may 
ring the Ministry's duty officer, telephone (021) 427-299. 
 
The Ministry would be grateful if this information could be 
drawn to the attention of all relevant Mission and Consular 
staff. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade takes this 
opportunity to renew to the Diplomatic and Consular Missions 
accredited to New Zealand the assurances of its highest 
consideration.

End note.
