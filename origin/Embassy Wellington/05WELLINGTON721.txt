Classified By: CDA D.R.BURNETT, REASON 1.4 (C) 
 
¶1. (C) Embassy Wellington requests authorization to process 
and store classified materials at the top secret level. 
 
¶2. (C) Wellington CIWG met 15 September 2005 and agreed that 
it was in Post's best interest to be able to increase our 
processing and storage levels.  Embassy Wellington currently 
has TS cleared American watchstanders who would ensure 
control of the processing area on a twenty four hour, seven 
days a week basis.  Embassy Wellington meets all the physical 
security requirements for the processing and storage at the 
top secret level.  Post expects to re-activate the MSG 
Detachment March 2006.
