NOMINATING-OFFICER: Roy Glover, PAO Wellington 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Last year, Haydon was named New Zealand's Best Overall 
Junior Reporter; in recent months he has declined three job 
offers from his newspaper's competitors. Haydon Dewes works 
for the country's second-largest daily newspaper. He is 
based in New Zealand's Parliamentary Press Gallery, where he 
works with three senior political correspondents and reaches 
a large audience covering the breaking  political news of 
the day. 
Haydon is responsible for the Dominion Post's coverage of 
immigration issues and Maori affairs, both roles that bring 
him into regular contact with New Zealand's ethnic, migrant, 
and refugee communities (including those from Iraq and 
Afghanistan). 
Haydon is an influential member of the Maori community (New 
Zealand indigenous people) and is regularly recognized at 
Maori meetings. 
He provides analysis and writes commentary and feature 
articles, including pieces on foreign policy. He has a 
strong interest in US policy. 
The Embassy and Haydon's peers and employers all consider 
him a likely future leader in NZ journalism. It was a rare 
move for the major daily to employ Haydon so soon out of 
journalism school, and he was quickly promoted to his 
current role in the Parliamentary Press Gallery. (Such 
placements are typically reserved for senior reporters with 
greater experience.) Haydon has also been a guest lecturer 
at a New Zealand journalism school. His nomination for this 
program enjoys the Charg's enthusiastic support.
