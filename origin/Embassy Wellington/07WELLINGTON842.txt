SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE TO NIE ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM 
 
REF: STATE 162558 
 
Classified By: U.S. Embassy Wellington DCM David J. Keegan, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

¶1. (S) DCM met with MFAT Deputy Secretary Alan Williams
December 4 to present NIE and talking points per reftel.
Williams said that MFAT would immediately prepare a summary
for cabinet and the Prime Minister.

¶2. (S) Williams commented that New Zealand has been clear in
its messages to Iran in all fora that New Zealand will honor
all UN mandated sanctions and that Iran must take the actions
called for by the international community and the UN Security
Council. It will be impossible for anything approaching a
normal political or economic relationship until Iran does so.
He added that trade between Iran and New Zealand is minimal,
and even the scale of that trade is exaggerated by the record
high prices for diary products, one of New Zealand's major
export commodities.

¶3. (S) Williams added that, while some may seek to use the
new NIE to argue against U.S. policy, our willingness to look
critically at earlier assessments, reflects "all that is best
in America." The message he would take from the NIE
conclusions is that this is not the time to relax the
international pressure, including sanctions, on Iran to meet
IAEA and UNSC demands.
