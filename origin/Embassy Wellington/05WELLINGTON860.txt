Post on November 4 delivered reftel non-paper to Jenny Reid, 
assistant director of New Zealand Food Safety Authority's 
Food Standards Group.  Reid reported that New Zealand shares 
the U.S. position on the use of a risk-based approach to 
setting maximum limits on nucleotides in infant formula.  New 
Zealand will support the maximum level of 16mg/100 kcal.  It 
also will continue to work closely with the U.S. delegation 
to make progress on the infant formula standard.
