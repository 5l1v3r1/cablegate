-- At a working dinner hosted by the French Ambassador on May 26,

-- The three envoys also agreed on the need for more regular P3 
consultations, including by video-conferencing. 
 
-- The French and UK envoys agreed with Gen. Gration that Sudan

End Key Points. 
 
Special Envoys' Working Dinner 
------------------------------ 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The President's Special Envoy for Sudan, Gen. Scott 
Gration, met on May 26 with the special envoys of France and the UK, 
over a working dinner hosted by the French Ambassador in Qatar. 
British Special Envoy Michael O'Neill emphasized the need to review 
all potential incentives and penalties at the disposal of France, 
the UK and the United States, to pressure the GOS, Justice and 
Equality Movement (JEM), and other rebel movements, to engage 
seriously in the Doha peace process.  An aide to French envoy Bruno 
Joubert argued for "sticks" to be used ahead of "carrots," otherwise 
the GOS would "just keep playing its games" and not deliver on its 
promises. 
 
¶2. (SBU) O'Neill suggested that the three envoys re-group in London 
on May 28 to continue the discussion of incentives and penalties, 
and to map out a plan for their application.  Gen. Gration and 
Joubert agreed to the meeting in principle. 
 
¶3. (SBU) All three envoys agreed on the need for more regular 
consultations, including by video-conferencing to save time and 
resources. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Gen. Gration briefed the group on his recent consultations 
in Beijing, recommending that France and the UK raise Sudan with the 
Chinese in their bilateral discussions "above the envoy level." 
This could help China's own bureaucracy in gaining the political 
support necessary to move Sudan higher on China's foreign policy 
agenda.  The UK and French envoys agreed with this assessment. 
 
¶5. (U) SE Gration's delegation has cleared this cable.
