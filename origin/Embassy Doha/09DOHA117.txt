---------------- 
(SBU) KEY POINTS 
---------------- 
 
  -- In a February 10 conversation with Poloff Caudill, 
National Human Rights Committee Chirman Dr. Ali Said Al-Marri 
stated that Qatar had decided to postpone the Gaza war crimes 
conference.  The conference had been scheduled to take place 
February 22-24 in Doha (see ref A). 
 
  -- In his conversation with Poloff Caudill, Al-Marri said 
that the conference would be postponed because some of the 
Palestinian invitees were unable to attend. 
 
-------------- 
(SBU) COMMENTS 
-------------- 
 
  -- The postponement of this conference, which was certain 
to turn generate widespread publicity in the Arab world, is a 
significant step back from the radical camp toward which 
Qatar has moved in recent weeks (see ref B). 
 
-- Embassy recommends that we reciprocate this gesture with a 
call from Special Envoy Mitchell to Prime Minister Hamad bin 
Jassim to update him on Senator Mitchell's activities in the 
region and to solicit Qatari views on the Palestinian-Israeli 
issue. 
 
End Key Points and Comments. 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a February 10 conversation with Poloff Caudill, 
National Human Rights Committee Chairman Dr. Ali Said 
Al-Marri stated that Qatar would "postpone" the Gaza war 
crimes conference scheduled to take place February 22-24 in 
Doha. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The postponement came after a February 4 
conversation between Ambassador and Al-Marri in which 
Ambassador urged him to postpone the Conference, given that 
the U.S.-Islamic World Forum was scheduled for the week 
preceding it. Ambassador cautioned that it might be difficult 
for the U.S. to participate in the Forum if Qatar went ahead 
with the "war crimes' conference as planned.  Dr. Al-Marri 
agreed to consult with his counterparts in the human rights 
community and report back to Ambassador. 
 
¶3. (SBU  Al-Marri said that the conference would be 
"postponed" because some of the Palestinian activists who had 
been invited to the Conference were unable to attend.
