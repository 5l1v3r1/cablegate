INVITATION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 55537 
 
Embassy Doha held its Independence Day reception in April due 
to the large number of nationals and expatriates who leave 
Qatar for holiday during the summer. (Note: This is standard 
Post practice).  At the time, guidance had not been issued 
from the Department to invite Iranian officials posted in 
Qatar.  As a result, no invitation was extended on Embassy 
Doha's behalf.
