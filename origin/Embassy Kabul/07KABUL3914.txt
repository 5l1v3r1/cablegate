SUBJECT: AMB VISIT:  DEVELOPMENT, POLICING AND 
RECONCILIATION KEY IN PAKTIA PROVINCE 
 
REF: KABUL 2341 
 
¶1. (SBU) During the Ambassador's November 12 visit to Paktia 
province in the east, locals stressed the key themes of 
security and development in the province.  In meetings with 
the Governor, Provincial Council, and Provincial Development 
Council, the Ambassador underscored the U.S. dedication to 
partnering with the Afghans in policing and rehabilitation 
efforts, our respect for Islam and the U.S. commitment to 
development projects in the east.  Gardez MPs who met with 
the Ambassador prior to the trip in Kabul raised what they 
saw as problems with U.S. efforts to rehabilitate former 
insurgents. 
 
SECURITY SEEN AS KEY 
-------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) During the Ambassador's November 12 meetings with 
Gardez Provincial Governor Rahmatullah Rahmat, members of the 
Provincial Council, Provincial Development Council and the 
local ulema council, security emerged as a key theme. 
Governor Rahmat, speaking forcefully, stressed that security 
was the key challenge in the province, but he also 
highlighted the need for better governance and more rule of 
law.  Rahmat noted his wish, echoed by many other eastern 
representatives, for a community-based policing system 
organized along tribal lines, which he said would work in 
Paktia to strengthen border security.  The Governor's 
comments on the need for community policing echoed those of 
Paktia MPs, who had met with the Ambassador in Kabul on 
November 10.  The Ambassador acknowledged to both the 
Governor and the MPs the importance of tribal alliances in 
the country, but stressed the need for national oversight of 
any local police force in order to avoid favoritism and 
selective application of the law.  He underlined the 
importance of loyalty to the central government. 
 
¶3. (SBU) All groups highlighted the need to strengthen the 
Program Takhim-e-Solhi (PTS), the "Strengthening the Peace" 
reconciliation program.  MP from the upper house Bakhtar 
Aminzai noted concerns regarding insecurity in the province, 
and complained that he felt that PTS, as it currently 
functions, is a "weak, failed program."  In contrast, MP Gul 
Padsha Mojadidi expressed support for PTS and its 
continuation.  The Ambassador underlined the U.S. commitment 
to PTS and its improvement.  He reiterated the position that 
any member of the Taliban who wished to live a decent life 
should be able to do so under PTS, with proper monitoring to 
ensure compliance with the program. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Responding to a query from a Provincial Council 
member regarding possible opium poppy eradication programs, 
the Ambassador said that, thus far, the international 
community was concerned that, if effective eradication action 
were taken, there would be violence.  The international 
community wished to avoid an additional complication in an 
already hard situation.  Gardez Chief of Police Brigadier 
General Ismatullah responded that there would be support for 
any possible eradication programs. 
 
DEVELOPMENT ISSUES ALSO RAISED 
------------------------------ 
¶5. (SBU) Development issues were discussed at length by all 
interlocutors, with appeals for roads, electricity projects, 
madrassas and hospitals voiced in all meetings.  The 
Ambassador and USAID Mission Director outlined U.S. 
assistance to the province, highlighting the Gardez-Khost 
road, which Governor Rahmat said would be key to moving 
people and goods to improve commerce in the province.  Both 
MP Mohammad Dawood Zazai and Governor Rahmat queried the 
Ambassador about a planned USAID-funded hospital in Gardez 
city.  USAID Mission Director noted that the funding for the 
project would be approved shortly, with construction slated 
to begin in mid 2008.  The Ambassador, in each meeting, noted 
that more assistance was going to Gardez Province during the 
current year than had been provided in the five previous 
years, and reiterated the U.S. commitment to keeping the 
Gardez-Khost pass usable over the winter.  Responding to 
requests for support for madrassas, the Ambassador underlined 
U.S. respect for Islam and religious education institutions.
