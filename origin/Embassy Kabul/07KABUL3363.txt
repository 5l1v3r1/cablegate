¶1. (SBU) The following is a summary of the current state of key 
ongoing USAID projects in the Afghan Energy Sector.  In-depth 
reporting on the various projects mentioned will be forthcoming in 
the near future. 
 
¶2. (SBU) 100 MW POWER PLANT FOR KABUL - (Reftel A) On September 23, 
2007, project contractor LBG/B&V formally took possession of the 
site and began preparations for demining and surveying.  Delivery of 
the first set of gensets (36 MW) is expected in May of 2008.  A 
second delivery will follow soon after and both sets are expected to 
be installed and operational by January 2009, delivering 72 MW of 
power into the Kabul power grid.  One potential problem remains.  A 
group of nomads living near the project site has been ordered to 
depart the area earlier than usual to move to their winter camping 
grounds.  They have done so, but it remains to be seen if they will 
heed the government's warning not to return to the site in the 
springtime.  We have been assured of the government's assistance 
should this eventuality occur. 
 
¶3. (SBU) NORTH EAST POWER SYSTEM (NEPS) - There have been several 
developments.  The Government of India (GOI) is considering 
expanding the scope of its assistance to include the funding and 
construction of two sub-stations on the NEPS line in Doshi and 
Charikar.  Approximate cost is USD 13 million.  These substations 
would reinforce the energy flow between Pul-e-Khumri (where all 
three branch NEPS lines meet) and Kabul. 
 
¶4. (SBU) At a recent meeting of the Interministerial Committee on 
Energy (ICE), Minister of Energy and Water Ismail Khan announced 
that the IRoA has allocated USD 100 million for the upgrading of the 
Kabul electricity distribution system.  It is desirable to have 
maximum upgrades to the Kabul system in place by early 2009, when 
initial NEPS power is expected to flow into the system. 
 
¶5. (SBU) REHABILITATION OF THE KAJAKI DAM - Due to continuing 
instability in the immediate area, the project is now 15 months 
behind schedule.  Materials for rehabilitation of the existing 
turbines have arrived in country and will be transported to the site 
once the security situation allow.  Despite discussions with local 
tribal chiefs resulting in an agreement to provide a secure window 
of time for trucks to carry materials to the Kajaki site, the 
shipment did not occur. 
 
¶6. (SBU) SHEBERGHAN GAS FIELD REHABILITATION PROJECT (Reftel B) - 
The tender to rehabilitate a number of gas wells for the proposed 
Sheberghan power plant closed September 12.  Two bids were received. 
 USAID contractor LBG/B&V is currently reviewing the submissions and 
a result is expected by the end of the first week in October.
