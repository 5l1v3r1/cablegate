SUBJECT: DEMARCHE REQUEST FOR JAPANESE RING ROAD 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary and Action Request: Representatives of 
Embassy Economic Section, CFC-A, USAID/Afghanistan, and 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Afghanistan Engineering 
District (AED) have held several recent meetings with the 
Japanese Embassy to discuss the status of suspended work on 
their 114-kilometer section of the ring road.  The Japanese 
report that work is about to resume on Phase A of this 
stretch; due to security-related cost overruns, however, 
they are seeking additional funding to allow completion of 
Phase B.  Embassy requests that Washington demarche the GOJ 
at a high level to ensure adequate and timely funding to 
complete the project.  The Japanese stressed that they have 
legal constraints against contracting with a foreign 
military to perform the work.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U)    Representatives of Embassy Economic Section, CFC-A, 
USAID/Afghanistan, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
Afghanistan Engineering District (AED) have held several 
recent meetings with the Japanese Embassy to discuss the 
status of suspended work on the 114-kilometer section of 
the ring road that Japan is funding from KH Sec 2 - KH Sec 
¶116.  This stretch is the only section of the ring road 
between Kabul and Herat that has experienced serious 
delays; the section funded by Saudi Arabia will be 
completed this year.  [Background: the company previously 
contracted by Japan to build this road abandoned work - 
without having actually improved any part of the road - for 
security reasons in April 2005.  The road therefore remains 
in extremely poor condition, passable only with difficulty 
and very slow travel times.] 
 
¶3. (SBU) CFC-A, USAID, and AED met Sunday August 20 with 
the Japanese DCM and Economic Cooperation Officer.  The 
Japanese thanked us for clarifying a previous offer of USG 
support and requested detailed information on what AED and 
USAID could do "informally."  AED gave the Japanese DCM a 
sheet of suggested advisory technical services that AED 
could supply on a pro bono basis.  These included: 
 
a)  Advice and consultation (no cost) to the Government of 
Japan during the different stages of the project. 
 
b)  Prior to issuing a contract tender, AED could advise on 
the standard and special contract stipulations that are 
applicable to construction in the region. 
 
c)  During tendering of the contract, AED is available to 
provide advice regarding procurement methods in Afghanistan 
and specifically in the region of the Ring Road. 
 
d)  During evaluation and negotiations, AED could provide 
unit cost information regarding materials, supplies, and 
labor. 
 
e)  After contract award, AED could offer advice on the 
initial coordination that should occur with the local 
villages, local sub-contractors, local Afghan Police and 
Army, and with the regional U.S., Coalition and ISAF 
forces. 
 
AED is preparing a letter for signature by Commanding 
General Eikenberry to cover a white paper that contains 
more detailed information to assist the Japanese in 
defining contract terms that will expedite the process and 
enable road work to get underway soonest. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The group then discussed the status of Japan's 
effort to find a new contractor for this roadwork.  Through 
a competitive procurement, Japan has selected an Indian 
firm (one with which USAID has worked successfully) to do 
as much of the 114 kilometers as possible.  Unfortunately, 
security concerns have significantly increased the cost of 
this road from the original estimate of 62 million dollars.

For approximately this amount, the proposed contractor now 
estimates that it can complete only half the length of the 
road.  Accordingly, the Japanese have divided their portion 
of the road into Phase A and Phase B.  Phase A covers 
approximately half the total number of kilometers and will 
include the portions of the road that are four-lane (those 
closest to Kandahar City).  They intend to proceed with 
Phase A now; indeed, they believe that bringing U.S. 
expertise to bear on the contracting for Phase A would 
actually slow them down.  Their best guess is that the 
contracting process will be complete by late September, and 
that roadwork will resume on Phase A, in October.  The 
Japanese Embassy has asked Tokyo to provide the remaining 
funds required to allow them to complete Phase B. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In a dinner hosted August 22 for the USAID Mission 
Director, Econ Counselor, and the head of USAID's 
Infrastructure Office, the Japanese DCM spoke frankly and 
colloquially about the need for U.S. support for his 
Embassy's request that Tokyo provide the additional funding 
needed to complete Phase B and to do this in a timely 
manner.  He did not provide a cost estimate, but Post 
assumes that it will be a lower cost than Phase A. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: The Japanese here understand the urgency 
of completing the road.  They also know that, now that work 
has resumed on the Saudi-financed portion of the Ring Road 
(KH Sec 116 - Sec 231), they are the odd man out.  In 
Post's opinion, an appropriately high-level demarche to 
Tokyo might prove very helpful in convincing the Japanese 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance to support their 
Kabul Embassy's request for additional funding.  One point, 
however, emerged very clearly from the conversations 
described above: while the Japanese Embassy welcomes the 
offer of pro bono AED advisory assistance, they stressed 
that the U.S. military cannot be used to actually carry out 
the Japanese project. 
 
¶7. (U)  Action request:  Embassy recommends the suggested 
demarche to Tokyo be delivered at a high level and as soon 
as possible.
