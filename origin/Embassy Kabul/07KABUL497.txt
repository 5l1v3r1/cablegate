SUBJECT: LEAHY VETTING REQUEST: BAMYAN CHIEF OF POLICE 
 
¶1. The name of Brigadier General Ghulam Ali Wahdat, 
formerly Chief of Police of Bamyan province, was initially 
submitted for international vetting as part of the police 
rank reform process. At that time, the United Nations 
Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) did not clear him 
for assignment under rank reform due to certain 
allegations. However, UNAMA has recently informed post that 
is has reviewed derogatory information against Wahdat and 
has concluded that the allegations are invalid due to 
inaccuracies from sources as well as the fact he was not 
present at the location in question when the alleged 
violations were committed. 
 
¶2. Post has not previously submitted Ghulam Ali Wahdat for 
Washington vetting because of UNAMA's earlier 
determination. According to UNAMA, Ghulam Ali Wahdat is not 
currently being considered for a new position under the 
police reform process but could be for a future assignment. 
Due to UNAMA's new determination, post is forwarding his 
name for vetting.
