SUBJECT: PRT/HELMAND - HELMAND PROVINCIAL COUNCIL 
ELECTS NEW UPPER HOUSE MEMBER 
 
(SBU) SUMMARY: Helmands Provincial Council (PC) 
exercised its constitutional duty and elected one of 
its members, Abdul Wahib, to replace Haji Ataullah, 
the deceased Upper House (Meshrano Jirga) member 
from Helmand.  Abdul Wahib had also served as the 
PCs secretary.  The election appeared to go 
smoothly.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The election took place late in the day 
of May 3.  In accordance with the Afghan 
constitution, the PC was charged to elect one of its 
own members to replace a deceased Upper House 
member.  Election observers included two officials 
from the United Nations Assistance Mission to 
Afghanistan, a number of provincial office 
directors, and local press. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  There were four candidates, including one 
female: 
--Abdul Wahid, who received six votes; 
--Haji Talib, who received three votes; 
--Reza Ghul (female), who received two votes; and 
--Mohammed Naim, who received three votes. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  On May 4, PC deputy chairman Urzghani 
told PRT poloff that the observers were satisfied 
with how the procedures were followed.  He also 
noted that, while there were four candidates, the PC 
members who were not elected appeared to accept the 
outcome in good spirits.  The PC will also have to 
elect a new secretary, he added. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Per the constitution, the PC candidate 
with the next highest number of votes in last 
Septembers election will take a seat on the PC. 
Accordingly, Engineer Mohammed Ismail from Sarwan 
Qala village in Sangin district, will be the new PC 
member.  Ismail is from the Alokazai tribe, has a 
grade 12 education and was formerly the head of the 
Lashkar Gah branch of the communist party.  It is 
believed that he cultivates opium poppy and has ties 
to local traffickers. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  The new Upper House member, Abdul Wahid, 
belongs to the Barakzai tribe.  He is from Karez 
village near Qali-Y-Bost (about 10 km south of 
Lashkar Gah).  His education level is grade 9.  He 
has no known narcotics ties and is considered 
relatively honest and progressive.  He owns a 
pharmacy business in Lashkar Gah. 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  While it is reasonable to 
assume that there was some behind the scenes 
maneuvering, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of 
this election was how it proceeded according to 
established guidelines in an orderly fashion within 
the allotted timeframe.  In that sense, it could be 
viewed as a good step forward for the PC and its 
ability to carry out the democratic process.  END 
COMMENT.
