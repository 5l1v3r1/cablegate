SUMMARY 
 
¶1. (SBU) Increasing food prices have been a concern since 
the summer, but the situation deteriorated in November.  In 
December, Pakistan, the major source of imported wheat for 
Afghanistan, formally imposed a 35% duty on wheat exports, 
after a November in which the Afghans perceived sporadic 
Pakistani attempts to hinder wheat exports.  This tariff 
increase may further complicate the December inflation 
picture in Afghanistan, as well as in the coming months. 
 
FOOD PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE 
 
¶2. (U) The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures from 
Afghanistan,s Central Bank (Da Afghanistan Bank) show that 
end-of-period, year-on-year overall CPI rose 15% between 
November 2006 and November 2007.  The price of food 
increased 23.2% and bread and cereals, a staple in the 
Afghan diet, increased 37% in the same period.  These 
figures are based upon prices in Kabul. 
 
¶3. (U) This is a deterioration of an already difficult 
situation for most Afghans.  As the Ramadan and Eid events 
concluded, food prices had declined slightly from 15.8% in 
September 2007 to 14.9% in October 2007, compared to the 
same periods in 2006. 
 
POLITICAL PRESSURE TO RESPOND 
 
¶4. (U) In response to high prices, the Finance Minister 
announced on Jan. 2 a temporary lifting of import duties on 
wheat and flour and a reduction in cooking oil duty from 
3.5% to 2.5%.  According to a Ministry of Finance source, 
President Karzai made this decision. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The increasing pressure in the Cabinet and 
Parliament to respond to high food prices has resulted in 
some senior officials unhelpfully advocating for a move 
away from the free market approach.  Specifically, some 
Cabinet members are advocating for the revival of state- 
owned enterprises, including one to distribute food at 
subsidized fixed prices.  The Finance Minister has argued 
to both Cabinet and Parliament,s Economic Committee against 
movement away from open market economic principles, and he 
is likely to face continued pressure once Parliament 
reconvenes in late January.  In a recent meeting, 
Ambassador Wood and the Finance Minister discussed food 
prices and Ambassador Wood emphasized the critical 
importance of the free market in Afghanistan. 
 
COMMENT 
 
¶5. (U) Post will continue to closely follow the price 
increase figures, and any IROA policy responses.  The 
December CPI figures are expected after January 10.
