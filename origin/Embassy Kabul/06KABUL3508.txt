¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: There have been no incidents of 
violence in connection with the Korean rally 
participants so far. Hundreds of participants have 
left Kabul over the last two days, including many 
Americans. The situation appears to have  largely 
been defused and the remaining Koreans are mostly 
event organizers who are likely to depart the 
country once they are confident that the other 
participants have left safely. The MOI continues to 
be cooperative and the Ministry of Transportation 
provided additional flights to help expedite 
departures. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Embassy has received confirmation that 
hundreds of Koreans and Korean-Americans left 
yesterday and today. PolOff and Vice Consul met with 
a group of 50-60 Americans this morning and outlined 
GOA options aimed at ensuring their security. Some 
members of the group expressed hostility towards the 
GoA and GoK for their roles in pressuring their 
departure and demanded an apology from the GoA. 
PolOff agreed to pass on their concerns but asked 
the group to focus on assessing security and 
deciding whether to leave or stay.  After a short 
deliberation, most members of the group decided to 
depart today. Vice Consul collected names and 
passport information from the Americans who wished 
to leave and passed the information to the GoA so 
appropriate arrangements could be made. Vice Consul 
also advised the group that those in need of further 
assistance once they reached Dubai should contact 
the U.S. Consulate. 
 
¶3. (SBU) When the Vice Consul called an Amcit 
yesterday, August 5, he said that they would think 
about leaving, but they might stay to "restore their 
honor and integrity".  He said they wanted to 
confront the "rumors" about the organization and 
prove that they were only here to help Afghan 
people, and were being "detained" unjustly.  The 
Amcit also said that a group might try to leave the 
compound.  Vice Consul warned him of the security 
and safety repercussions of such action and asked if 
he wanted to take such a risk, for himself and his 
family.  He said they were willing to take the risk. 
The group reiterated this threat several times today 
but eventually decided the wisest course of action 
was to leave, including the two most vocal 
participants. 
 
¶4. (SBU) There are still a few participants who 
remain in country, and their freedom of movement 
continues to be limited by the GoA. Post learned, 
however, that some Koreans are still being let into 
the country.  EmbOffs had contact with 12 Korean- 
Americans who entered Afghanistan Saturday, August 5 
and were planning to tour the country. Vice Consul 
advised them of the situation, and the GOA's 
restrictions, and offered assistance if they chose 
to leave. They said that they would consider leaving 
on Monday, August 7. Post was told by a ConOff in 
Dubai that Korean-Americans there (some of whom were 
refused entry to Afghanistan) told the Consulate 
 
KABUL 00003508  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
that Korean-Americans were being allowed to enter 
Afghanistan if they were born in the USA but 
naturalized citizens were not. 
 
¶5. COMMENT: The situation appears to be settling and 
Embassy does not expect any violence associated with 
the Korean rally group. Most of the participants 
have left and the government continues to provide 
opportunities for departure to those who remain. The 
situation, thus far, though unorganized, has been 
handled effectively by the Afghan authorities.
