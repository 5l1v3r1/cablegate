SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. On September 7, Dow Ab District Administrator Qari Daud expressed 
his frustration to the PRT's Integrated Command Team (PICG) about 
Kabul's lack of inclusion of Nuristan voices in the provincial 
gubernatorial selection process.  He described the security 
situation in the district as stable, but stressed that the area 
remains vulnerable to infiltration by insurgents.  Daud pleaded for 
additional development projects that will demonstrate the 
government's ability to provide economic benefits to the people, 
including U.S. assistance in pressuring the UN to take a more active 
role in Dow Ab.  Finally, Daud promised Nuristan will remain 
poppy-free in the next year--hoping this will lead to more 
international assistance.

¶2. Dow Ab District Administrator Qari Daud told the PICG during a 
September 7 meeting at PRT Nuristan (Kala Gush) that he does not 
expect the GIRoA's Independent Directorate for Local Governance 
(IDLG) to consult Nuristani district administrator's in selecting a 
replacement for the late governor, Hazrat Din.  (Hazrat Din was 
killed in a car accident on September 5, reftel). "Kabul will select 
a governor who is good for Kabul, and will not discuss it with the 
people of Nuristan," he said.  Daud agreed with the IDLG, that the 
position should be filled quickly but his frustration with the 
gubernatorial selection process was evident during our discussion. 
He noted that he is a supporter of direct provincial elections, but 
realizes this is not constitutional.  Despite this, he appears 
prepared to work with Kabul's decisions. 
 
¶3. Doud explained that the current security situation in Dow Ab is 
stable, but stressed that the district remains vulnerable to 
infiltration by insurgents.  The district administrator's described 
the one-hundred fifty man strong district police presence as 
"somewhat effective," but added that many of the police seem to 
think their job is to "sit and drink tea at the district center," as 
opposed to appropriately manning the various checkpoints.  Daud 
promised the PICG that Dow Ab will remain poppy-free next year and 
said that he hoped that we could encourage the UN and other 
international donors to take a more active development role in the 
area.  The PICG explained that Nuristan was already benefiting from 
its poppy-free status through the "Good Performers Initiative 
(GPI)," and noted our understanding that UNAMA intends to create a 
more permanent presence in Parun, Nuristan - but will do so only 
after the PRT also relocates to the capital. 
 
¶4. Daud said the people's support for the government may not be 
sustainable without further development in Dow Ab that effectively 
demonstrates the GIRoA's ability to deliver economic benefits.  He 
argued for make-work projects, roads, animal husbandry programs, and 
"any other PRT programs" that can assist district development.  The 
PICG explained that the PRT is committed to increasing assistance 
(CERP AND USAID) to the district but added that current U.S.-funded 
road construction in the area is critical to bringing in supplies 
for additional projects.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5. Daud is a weekly visitor to the PRT, always armed with requests 
for additional development projects in Dow Ab (and for local 
government supplies - including a recent request for a vehicle).  He 
appears very concerned with demonstrating to the population that he 
can deliver development; however, it is unclear if his commitment is 
to extending the legitimacy of the GIRoA and its institutions or to 
increasing his own personal standing.
