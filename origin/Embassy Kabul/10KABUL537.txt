DRILLS FOR SERVICE IN AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1. Service in Afghanistan is both physically and mentally 
challenging.  This is particularly true of service in the field - at 
Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), District Support Teams 
(DSTs) and at the numerous entities throughout Afghanistan where 
civilian personnel are co-located with military elements.  Rough 
field conditions necessitate a minimum level of physical fitness for 
candidates to be able to perform safely and effectively.  Failure to 
attain this minimum level can, in the worst case scenario, mean the 
difference between life and death and endanger not only the 
employee, but the troops and civilians serving with the employee, 
who rightly feel a sense of responsibility for the wellbeing of the 
entire team.  To ensure that employees have the requisite level of 
fitness to serve safely and effectively in Afghanistan, post 
strongly urges  instituting a mandatory physical assessment test to 
all USG recruits for service outside of Kabul.  The test could be 
administered as part of the mandatory training class RS510, 
conducted at Camp Atterbury. Any candidate who fails the test would 
not be cleared for service outside of Kabul.  Additionally, post 
recommends including a paragraph highlighting the physical demands 
of service in Afghanistan as part of the Afghanistan Support Office 
(ASO) recruitment process.  See suggested language in para 3. 
 
¶2.  The proposed test would mimic real-life conditions in the field. 
 We propose that at the very least it include the following drills: 
 
 --The Helicopter Dash and Hop Aboard:  In full body armor, 
candidates will dash 25 meters to board a Blackhawk helicopter 
staged for take-off.  Candidates will be given specific instructions 
by ground crew and will be expected to follow them safely and 
expeditiously to board and secure themselves for a rapid takeoff.  A 
reasonable time limit will be set. 
 
 --The Jump-in/Jump-out Humvee/MRAP Drill:  In full body armor, 
candidates will run 25 meters, jump into a Humvee or MRAP, strap 
themselves in and prepare to depart.  Then upon instruction, they 
will quickly jump out of the vehicle and run 25 meters back to the 
start point.  A reasonable time limit will be set. 
 
 --The "We've Got To Go NOW" Drill:  Candidates are placed in a 
scenario where they are attending a meeting with their armor taken 
off.  Upon receiving a signal, they must put the armor on as quickly 
as possible and follow the security force outside to a waiting 
vehicle.  A reasonable time limit will be set. 
 
¶3.  Suggested language to be included in the field position job 
descriptions:  Working at a field location in Afghanistan requires 
frequent engagement in strenuous physical activities in various 
types of terrain in demanding environments, side by side with 
military counterparts.  Duties involve physical exertion, such as 
long periods of standing, walking over rough, uneven or rocky 
surfaces; recurring bending, crouching, stooping, stretching, 
reaching or similar activities while wearing Individual Body Armor 
(IBA) and a Kevlar Helmet.  It may also be necessary from time to 
time to carry a backpack with 20 or more pounds of food, water and 
personal equipment.   This position requires the ability to run 
short distances while wearing body armor and a Kevlar helmet and the 
ability to climb in and out of military vehicles such as the Humvee, 
MRAP and/or military aircraft without assistance.  This position may 
also require walking up and down steep terrain, walking through 
ravines and dry creek beds, and jumping across gullies, irrigation 
trenches and furrows, all while wearing Body Armor and a Kevlar 
Helmet.
