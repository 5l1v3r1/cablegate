SUBJECT: EXBS Afghanistan Advisor Monthly Reporting Cable - November 
2006 
 
KABUL 00005923  001.2 OF 005 
 
 
¶I. SUMMARY 
 
¶1.   (SBU) During this reporting period the EXBS Advisor met with 
the Afghan Engineering District (AED), Director General of the 
Afghan Customs Department (ACD), and a USAID Bearing Point 
contractor to further discuss the relocation of the Spin Boldak 
Border Crossing Point (BCP) to Weesh, several kilometers from Spin 
Boldak on the Pakistan border. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The EXBS Advisor attended a design charette at the Afghan 
Engineering District (AED) with the President of the Kabul 
International Airport (KIA), a KIA Security Advisor, a USAID Bearing 
Point contractor, and a representative from International Narcotics 
and Law Enforcement (INL) contractor, DynCorp.  This was the initial 
phase of proposed design upgrades for KIA's perimeter security being 
funded by the Ministry of Transportation and Aviation under the 
direction of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
representative. 
 
¶3. (SBU) During this reporting period the EXBS Advisor organized and 
participated in a visit with other BMI members to the Towraghundi 
and Islam Qalah BCP on the Iranian border to meet with AED 
representatives and their contractor to examine the site for the 
construction of the new BCP. BMI members also visited the DynCorp 
Regional Training Center to discuss training issues and the progress 
of DynCorp's Forward Operating Base (FOB) near the Islam Qalah BCP. 
These projects were further discussed with the Herat Provincial 
Governor by BMI members, Herat US Envoy, CFC-A Liaison Officer, and 
representatives from the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and 
Commerce. 
 
¶4.   (SBU) To further stem the occurrences of diverted cargo 
shipments while in transit, the ACD has deployed Mobile Verification 
Teams (MVT). The MVTs have been in operation prior to the 
introduction of the ASYCUDA transit system for the purpose of 
intercepting smuggled or diverted goods and to discourage evading 
the payment of duty and taxes. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The ACD approached the Border Management Initiative (BMI) 
group to inquire about providing the Iranian customs department with 
BMI's BCP design being utilized at newly constructed BCP's 
throughout Afghanistan. The Iranians are proposing the opening of a 
new BCP located at a location known as Mile Marker 78, approximately 
midway between the Islam Qalah BCP and the Zaranj BCP. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The ACD's placement of establishing an Afghan Customs 
Office at the U.S. Bagram Air Force Base is one step closer after 
five of their officers have been successfully vetted through the 
Ministry of Intelligence.  The officers will conduct customs 
examinations on non-exempt commercial goods entering Afghanistan via 
commercial couriers at the Air Base. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The USG Border Management Initiative (BMI) staff is 
awaiting the arrival of two Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
Customs and Border Protection Officers to serve on the newly formed 
Border Management Task Force (BMTF).  These officers are legacy 
customs inspectors and are due to arrive in Kabul on December 8, 
2006, to fulfill the Customs Systems Design Coordinator's position 
until their departure on March 30, 2007. 
 
END SUMMARY 
 
II. ITEMS OF BROAD INTEREST. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The USG Border Management Initiative (BMI) is in 
consultation with ACD and USAID Bearing Point to relocate the Spin 
Boldak BCP to Weesh, several kilometers from Spin Boldak on the 
Pakistan border. The reasons surrounding this consideration include 
the existence of escape routes between the Pakistan border and the 
 
KABUL 00005923  002.2 OF 005 
 
 
Spin Boldak BCP and the threat posed by contraband smuggling 
activities including conventional weapons and explosives through a 
large bazaar adjacent to the location where the Weesh BCP would be 
constructed. Locating a newly constructed BCP at Weesh with built-in 
security features would help stabilize security in the area and 
choke off the smuggling route currently used between Spin Boldak and 
Weesh.  DynCorp is building a new FOB in the area to place their 
police mentors at the Spin Boldak BCP to help restore supervision at 
the crossing.  Placing an Afghan Border Police (ABP) check point at 
the exit point to the bazaar to preclude contraband from entering 
Afghanistan from Pakistan through the back door of the bazaar.  No 
donor funding has been identified for the proposed project. 
 
¶9. (SBU) The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was approached by the 
Afghan Ministry of Public Works (MPW) to construct a 
Quetta-Chaman-Weesh/Spin Boldak-Kandahar railway line.  ADB 
responded that it was not economically feasible given the projected 
volume of traffic and cargo.  Building a railway to establish an 
inter-modal transport network appears to be a long-term project. 
 
¶10. (SBU) The EXBS Advisor coordinated a security survey at the 
Kabul International Airport (KIA) by DynCorp, GPPO, and the Afghan 
Engineering District (AED) in October 2006.  During this reporting 
period AED presented its draft Statement of Work (SOW) and the 
initial design for perimeter security at KIA to the President of the 
airport authority.  Efforts are continuing to secure $2 million USD 
from the Ministry of Transportation and Aviation to help fund the 
project.  Another $2.5 million USD may be available from the 
ministry for infrastructure upgrades to the existing terminal. 
These projects should improve the efficiency of passenger processing 
and the effectiveness of airport security during the 3-year, $28 
million Japanese-funded construction of a new international 
terminal.  After its completion, the existing terminal will remain 
in operation for domestic flights only. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Kabul based BMI members, JIACG, AED and their 
contractors, and Afghan ministerial representatives toured the 
Towraghundi and Islam Qalah BCPs to conduct on-site design 
charrettes of the infrastructure projects funded by JIACG.  This 
team also met with the Herat Provincial Governor and DynCorp's 
Regional Training Center (RTC) Command.  The results of this trip 
follows: 
 
a. Partial Notice for the Towraghundi BCP was given to proceed with 
the power for the BCP (German-funded structures) and drilling the 
existing well deeper for better water.  A review of the rail yard 
resulted in a re-design of the proposed upgrades because the large 
amount of rail cargo arriving daily is transferred to trucks for 
further transportation. 
 
b. BMI, AED, and contract representatives toured the Islam Qalah BCP 
with General Ayoub (ABP), Director General (ACD) and ministry 
representatives from Finance, Agriculture, Commerce and Interior. 
During the tour, it was decided to relocate the new BCP to the north 
of the existing BCP to de-conflict with private property owners and 
prevent land disputes. 
 
c. This group also met with the Governor of Herat to discuss the BCP 
projects in his Province.  The Governor agreed with the importance 
of the proposed BCP projects and vowed to support them. 
 
d. A police training and standardization meeting led by the German 
Police Project Office (GPPO) and a UNOPS representative from ACD was 
held at the Herat RTC.  Training representatives from Blackwater, 
DynCorp, Italian Carabinieri, Guardia di Finanza, and CSTC-A Police 
Reform Directorate (PRD) were present to discuss the publishing of 
the Charter of Functions for the ABP and Afghan Customs Police (ACP) 
and standardization and coordination of training programs for all 
instructors to follow. 
 
KABUL 00005923  003.2 OF 005 
 
 
 
¶12. (SBU) Status of other recent ACD projects are as follows: 
 
a. New Customs/Revenue HQ Building, Kabul - the building will house 
both the headquarters of the customs and revenues services. 
Construction is expected to be completed by December 2007. 
 
b. Jalalabad Customs House - the existing customs house at Jalalabad 
is being upgraded to improve services for the traders. The upgrades 
include building new warehouses including cold storage for 
perishable goods, laboratory space, new parking space and separate 
oil parking facility. The project is close to completion and the new 
building is expected to be turned over to the ACD in December 2006. 
 
c. Hairatan multi-component ICD - in cooperation with the Ministry 
of Commerce, three planned customs satellite offices (in addition to 
the main customs office) at the Hairatan BCP have been completed. 
These offices serve the River Port, Oil and Gas Port, and the 
Railway Port that are owned and operated by the Ministry of 
Commerce. The buildings were turned over to the ACD in November 
¶2006. 
 
d. Towraghundi customs office - a small customs office is being 
funded by the World Bank and constructed by UNOPS at the Towraghundi 
BCP to facilitate trade and improve revenue collection. The office 
is expected to be completed by December 2006.  The USG upgrade 
project will augment existing facilities and is expected to be 
completed in April 2007. 
 
e. Torkham customs facility - a newly constructed customs facility 
to house the ASYCUDA transit module has been built by UNOPS at the 
Torkham BCP. The building was recently turned over to the ACD. The 
transit tracing capability of the computerized ASYCUDA system is 
responsible for the recovery of missing cargo and associated revenue 
along the Torkham-Jalalabad-Kabul axis and serves as a deterrent for 
other miscreants. 
 
¶13.     (SBU) To further stem the tide of diverted cargo shipments 
while in transit, the ACD has deployed Mobile Verification Teams 
(MVT). The MVTs have been in operation since just prior to the 
introduction of the ASYCUDA system.  However, traders have lodged 
charges of corruption within these teams with the ACD. 
Subsequently, the ACD improved supervision of these teams. In an 
effort to curb corruption, two new customs forms were introduced to 
ensure better control and proper accountability of seized goods held 
at customs warehouses. These reforms have contributed in the 
collection of nearly $1 million of additional revenues during the 
last reporting period. 
 
¶14.  (SBU) During a recent visit to Iran, Afghan President Karzai 
and Iranian officials agreed to open a new BCP at Mile Marker 78 
located approximately mid-way between the Islam Qalah and Zaranj 
BCPs.  ACD was unaware that this issue was being discussed during 
the President's visit. It is believed that the new crossing will 
increase bilateral trade.  Establishing this BCP might curb 
smuggling suspected of occurring in the vast open spaces between the 
Islam Qalah and Towraghundi BCPs.  A similar approach was used 
several years ago on the Pakistan border with Afghanistan. 
 
¶15. (SBU) The ACD identified the need to collect additional Customs 
revenue from commercial couriers housed at the U.S. Bagram Air Force 
Base (BAF) north of Kabul.  Five customs officers were selected to 
clear goods entering the country through BAF are in the process of 
security vetting prior to assignment there.  The ACD program at BAF 
is expected to begin within 30 days after obtaining clearance to 
work at BAF.  ACD also drafted new procedures for regulation of 
import/export cargo by couriers.  The companies have been directed 
to deposit a bank guarantee of $50,000 USD each as security for 
clearances and to provide exemption certificates for each exempted

consignment. 
 
¶16. (SBU) The USG Border Management Initiative (BMI) staff is 
continuing its efforts to formulate a 12-person Border Management 
Task Force (BMTF). The Combined Forces Command of Afghanistan 
(CFC-A) dedicated two military officers to fill the Deputy Director 
and Planning positions.  Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) 
has provided TDY personnel for 2 months to assist in starting up the 
Finance, Metrics, and Donor Coordination positions.  Selections made 
from the resumes reviewed for the Border Police and Immigration 
Systems Coordinator and corresponding mentor positions have been 
forwarded to JIACG for further action.  Resumes of capable 
individuals for the Customs Systems Design Coordinator and 
corresponding mentor positions have yet to be received.  However, 
with the pending arrival on December 8, 2006, of two Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP) officers from the Department of Homeland 
Security it is expected that experienced candidates for these 
positions will be identified with their assistance.  These TDY 
officers are expected to assist the BMTF in customs matters until 
their departure scheduled for March 30, 2007. 
 
¶17.  (U) TRAINING CONDUCTED DURING REPORTING PERIOD. 
 
Nothing to report. 
 
¶18.  (U) EQUIPMENT DELIVERED DURING REPORTING PERIOD. 
 
Under Procurement. 
 
¶19.  (SBU) IMMINENT TRAINING OR EQUIPMENT STATUS UPDATE. 
 
The BMTF 6-person mentoring team consisting of two former Border 
Patrol agents and four former Customs Inspectors is expected to 
deploy to the Islam Qalah BCP in 2007.  These mentors will be 
responsible for conducting On-The-Job-Training (OJT) to ABP and 
Customs Officers.  In the interim, USAID Bearing Point has agreed to 
position two of its Customs Advisors at the Islam Qalah BCP upon 
completion of DynCorp's Forward Operating Base (FOB), now known as 
the Border Training Facility (BTF), in January 2007.  The EXBS 
Advisor is coordinating with INL representatives to secure 
logistical support at the new BTF. 
 
¶20.  (SBU) EXBS is awaiting the delivery of x-ray screening machines 
for baggage and cargo, fiberoptic scopes, density meters, 
radioisotope identifiers, explosive detectors, handheld metal 
detectors, cranes, forklifts, vehicle inspection kits, and tool kits 
destined for the Islam Qalah and Towraghundi BCPs. The Rapidscan 
x-ray screening machines is scheduled to arrive in Kabul in December 
¶2006.  No delivery dates are available for the remaining items, but 
the EXBS Advisor has secured temporary storage for the equipment and 
will coordinate logistical arrangements as the equipment arrives.
