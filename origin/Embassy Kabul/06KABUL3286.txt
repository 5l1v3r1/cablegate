SUBJECT: POSSIBLE DATES FOR THE U.S.-AFGHAN STRATEGIC 
PARTNERSHIP MEETING 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The Afghan side has proposed September 6-7 for the 
upcoming U.S.-Afghan Strategic Partnership meeting.  These 
dates conflict with the September 4-6 visit to Kabul of the 
North Atlantic Council (NAC, including the 26 NATO 
Ambassadors), for many of whom we will need to provide 
housing and possibly transportation and security support. 
However, we have discussed with Deputy Foreign Minister 
Saikol a somewhat shortened Strategic Partnership meeting, 
which could start at 16:00 on September 6, followed by an 
official dinner; re-commencing early on September 7 and 
continuing throughout that day. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Saikol appeared amenable to this somewhat 
shortened schedule, but said he would have to speak with 
colleagues before giving official GOA approval.  While 
Afghans normally do not schedule meetings on Fridays, which 
would rule out September 8 as a possibility, Saikol did not 
dismiss this option out of hand, saying only that it would be 
something to consider.  Saikol noted that President Karzai 
would be available on September 6 and 7. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Please advise if starting at 16:00 on September 6 
would be feasible.  (Note: in order for adequate housing to 
be available for the U.S. delegation, they would need to 
arrive no earlier than mid-day on September 6, probably via 
milair.  End Note)
