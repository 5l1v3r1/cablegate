SUBJECT: KHOST PROVINCE: STABLE SECURITY SITUATION AND GOOD 
GOVERNANCE PERMIT SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY 
 
REF: 07 Kabul 3913 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Khost's security situation has improved over the 
last six months.  Afghan National Security Forces and Coalition 
Forces have performed joint operations in less secure areas, and 
police morale is improving.  The generally stable security situation 
has allowed significant reconstruction and development work in the 
province.  Khost has an extremely effective governor in Arsala 
Jamal. 
 
Security 
-------- 
¶2. (SBU) Khost has a largely positive security environment despite 
its border location and immediate proximity to North Waziristan, 
Pakistan.  Only two of Khost's 13 districts (Sabari and Gorbiz) are 
classified as somewhat insecure, but Coalition Forces (CF) and 
Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) are able to operate even in 
those two districts.  Recent sectarian fighting between Sunni and 
Shia groups in Pakistan's Kurram Agency has led to an influx of 
refugees (about 600 families) into Khost.  UNHCR and the provincial 
government have been able to provide assistance to the refugees. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Strong coordination between CF and ANSF has helped sustain 
the stable security environment in Khost.  U.S. military units 
remain positioned alongside ANSF at seven of the 13 district 
centers.  A recent joint ANSF and CF-initiated operation ("Matoon") 
in Sabari District and Zambar region was designed to lessen 
extremist influence in the area.  It has seen strong initial success 
with a surprising number of elders welcoming the operation; this 
success is tempered by some resident complaints concerning repeated 
searches of compounds and about missing household items. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Governor Jamal has regularly requested closer involvement 
of provincial leaders prior to detention operations, to the extent 
possible.  Asking officials (governor and sub-governors primarily) 
to bring in targeted residents for questioning - or eventual 
handover - represents a sensitive area still in need of improvement. 
 CF are aware of this priority. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Recent pay parity salary increases have helped improve 
morale among Khost police.  The force has had some difficulty 
staffing security positions in one border district (Spera). 
Officers argue that those who volunteer for duty in the most 
volatile areas should receive "danger pay."  Khost residents 
continue to complain of police corruption. 
 
Development 
----------- 
¶6. (U) The PRT's "outside-in" project strategy, which emphasizes 
development in remote areas of the province, makes use of 
Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) funding, with an 
estimated USD 43M in CERP funds expended in Khost in the last six 
months.  All districts with the exception of a few isolated areas 
continue to see significant levels of reconstruction.  Recent 
military operations in Zanbar, Sabari District -- one of the areas 
with little development activity -- will allow projects to begin. 
 
¶7. (U) Work on the Khost-Gardez road - the major transit route 
between Khost and Kabul - is set to begin this spring, implemented 
by USAID partner Louis Berger Group.  Improved winter maintenance - 
also a USAID initiative - should help prevent road closures.  Khost 
leaders and residents continue to press the PRT for an airport plan. 
 Only U.S. forces use both of the province's current runways.  Khost 
provides a large manual labor pool to Gulf States, and air travel 
access to Kabul would help expand work opportunities and promote 
greater investment. 
 
Governance 
---------- 
¶8. (SBU) The reach and visibility of Khost provincial officials has 
improved across the province.  Individual leader effectiveness, 
however, remains mixed.  The gap between Khost residents and 
provincial government has closed, but there remain criticisms of 
corruption.  Relations between Khost and Kabul have improved 
recently. Notably, a delegation of Khost officials (Governor Jamal, 
Provincial Council members, and Members of Parliament) met with IRoA 
ministers in November to press province-wide priorities (reftel).

Their unified voice led to positive follow-up by some ministers (the 
Minister of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD), for 
example) but not others (Agriculture). 
 
¶9. (U) Governor Jamal remains a strong leader, ably managing 
relations with the PRT, the tribes, Kabul, and the media.  He 
survived suicide car bomb attacks in August and October.  Governor 
Jamal enjoys good relations with key constituencies such as tribes, 
religious leaders and civil society. 
 
¶10. (U) The Provincial Council (PC) is a functioning body dominated 
by a few key members.  The chairman usually represents it at 
project-opening ceremonies.  Female members have been largely absent 
from events.  The PC has sought a larger role in project 
prioritization; a new reconstruction committee (echoing an already 
established and effective security committee) will give PC members a 
more formal role. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Khost's district administrators are based at district 
centers throughout the province.  In key areas, they have helped 
improve relations with residents and have increasingly been brought 
into discussions about project priorities.  Weak district 
administrators have been reassigned.  Some friction remains between 
officials who were associated with the former Communist government 
and those who led opposing mujahadeen forces. 
 
¶12. (U) Some line ministries function well in Khost, particularly 
MRRD.  The Provincial Development Council meets regularly to 
prioritize projects.  USAID has funded a program to help improve 
capabilities.  Line ministry directors regularly compliment the 
active and well-funded PRT project strategy, while remaining 
critical of IRoA follow-up regarding provincial priorities.
