SUBJECT: LEAHY VETTING REQUEST:  ANP MAJORS PART TWO OF FOUR 
 
REF: 01/09/07 Ingram/Richards email 
 
¶1. This is an action request. 
 
¶2. In order to comply with Leahy vetting requirements, this cable 
forwards the names and biodata of 60 Afghan National Police officers 
with the rank of Major. This is the second cable in a series of 
four.  Per ref, post requests Department to begin vetting these 
individuals even though the United Nations Mission to Afghanistan 
(UNAMA) has not completed its vetting. When there are individuals 
with one name: Post has made a good faith effort to ensure that the 
individuals with one name actually only have one name.  For 
individuals for whom date and/or place of birth is not available, 
Post will work with MOI and CSTC-A to retrieve this information. 
 
¶3. Post will inform Department of any derogatory information found 
by Embassy or UNAMA during in-country vetting. Derogatory 
information regarding these individuals will be entered into ACES. 
Post requests expeditious processing of these names since the 
individuals will be posted to priority positions mostly in the south 
and east.  It is expected that the Majors' selection list will be 
signed by President Karzai the week of January 15.  The MOI intends 
to put them in their new positions as soon as possible after the 
list has been signed, potentially immediately (see septel).
