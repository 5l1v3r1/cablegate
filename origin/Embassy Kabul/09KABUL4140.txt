SUBJECT: MINISTER OF FINANCE DISCUSSES HOLD-UP IN GOVERNMENT FUNDS 
FOR KEY SERVICES AND HIS HOPE TO REACH HIPC COMPLETION POINT BY THE 
LONDON CONFERENCE 
 
REF: KABUL 4137 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: On December 16, Coordinating Director for 
Development and Economic Affairs (CDDEA) E. Anthony Wayne met with 
Afghan Minister of Finance, Omar Zakhilwal, to discuss why GIRoA has 
been slow to release funds for a variety of important services, 
including prison guards' wages and fuel for electricity generators 
in Kandahar.  According to Minister Zakhilwal, the issue has been 
Parliament's refusal to pass the 1388 (current) midyear budget 
supplement, due to a set of 18 concerns which the Minister called 
"trivial."  (Update: Minister Zakhilwal responded this week with an 
issue-by-issue response to each of Parliament's 18 concerns. 
However, passage of the midyear budget supplement remains unlikely 
for at least another week, as Parliament is currently questioning 
Cabinet nominees in plenary.  He subsequently authorized use of $1 
million to keep electricity flowing in Kandahar after urgent pleas 
from local authorities, us and President Karzai.)  In the meeting, 
Minister Zakhilwal also discussed the London Conference, noting his 
satisfaction with the current agenda and stressing his desire to 
conduct the HIPC Completion review before the Conference. End 
Summary. 
 
DELAY IN MIDYEAR BUDGET LEADS TO 
LACK OF FUNDS FOR KEY SERVICES 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Wayne noted concerns from Kandahar that the 
Kandahar diesel generator plant operated by Da Afghanistan Breshna 
Sherkat (DABS) could not buy fuel due to a lack of funds and that 
electricity shortages were already hitting the major southern city. 
Lack of funding has also left the Ministry of Finance of the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) unable to 
release funds for the salaries of many Afghan prison guards for 
several months.  Minister Zakhilwal explained that both issues were 
the result of Parliament's delay in approving this year's (1388) 
mid-year budget supplement, which contains the allocated funds for 
DABS' fuel purchase and for prison guards' wages.  (Note: According 
to the Afghan solar year calendar, the current year, 1388, runs from 
March 21st 2009 through March 20th 2010.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Minister explained that parliament has delayed passage 
of the midyear budget supplement due 18 concerns with the document, 
each of which Zakhiwal considers "trivial."  They include concerns 
about municipalities awarding building contracts without prior 
Parliament approval (contra to the Procurement Law); the 
establishment of several ANP security units (one for highways and 
one for the Aynak Copper Mine) without prior Parliament approval; 
dissatisfaction with an AFS79 million wheat procurement contract; 
and concern about whether specific expenditures should be located on 
the development or operational budget. (UPDATE:  This week, Minister 
Zakhilwal sent a document to Parliament responding issue-by-issue to 
each of Parliament's 18 concerns.  Parliament is expected to review 
the document once the cabinet nominee questions are complete, 
possibly early mid-January (reftel). In the interim, responding to 
requests from President Karzai, local authorities and us, Zakhilwal 
ordered the Budget Department at the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to 
reallocate $1 million from other discretionary spending to the fuel 
subsidy.  However, this is only a short-term solution as daily 
Kandahar electricity operations consume approximately 100,000 liters 
of diesel fuel, which costs about $100,000.  A similar interim plan 
for paying prison guards does not yet exist.) 
 
MINISTER SEEKS HIPC COMPLETION REVIEW IN JANUARY 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ambassador Wayne and Minister Zakhilwal also discussed the 
process necessary for GIRoA to satisfy the mining regulations 
trigger needed to reach HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Countries) 
completion. (Note: Reaching the HIPC completion point would provide 
GIRoA with approximately $1 billion in debt relief.  GIROA has made 
substantial progress on all of the triggers.  However, the World 
Bank still needs to sign off on new mining regulations for GIRoA to 
satisfy the Mining Trigger (which requires that GIROA implement more 
stringent mineral and hydrocarbon regulations).  The new regulations 
were only given to the World Bank for review in early December.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Zakhilwal urged Ambassador Wayne to encourage World Bank 
staff to review the mining regulations quickly enough to allow a 
HIPC completion point review to take place in January, before the 
London Conference.  According to Zakhilwal, doing the HIPC review in 
January will add to a "spirit of reform" entering into the London 
Conference and show the incoming cabinet that there is a reward for 
taking tough actions. 
 
¶5. (SBU) NOTE: The Mission has followed up with World Bank Staff on 
the feasibility of reviewing the mining regulations within such a 
 
KABUL 00004140  002 OF 002 
 
 
short period of time.  World Bank staff has responded that they will 
likely be able to circulate HIPC documents prior to January 28, 
which means that review of HIPC Completion might be possible before 
the London Conference.  We are consulting with World Bank staff on 
the feasibility of this time line and urge Washington agencies to 
support this schedule.  End Note. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ambassador Wayne also followed up on Minister Zakhilwal's 
recent request that the USG provide him with information pertaining 
to recent allegations against the Minister of Mines.  Based on an 
assessment provided by embassy elements, Ambassador Wayne noted that 
the Mission did not have any specific, actionable information 
against the Minister of Mines. 
 
MINISTER SATISFIED WITH LONDON CONFERENCE AGENDA 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Minister Zakhilwal expressed satisfaction with his recent 
conversations with the British State Secretary for DFID on the 
agenda for the upcoming London Conference.  Zakhilwal is working 
closely with the British to design the economic components of the 
agenda.  He said both sides are in agreement that the London 
Conference should focus on the "what" or broad goals of reform, 
while the Kabul Conference in March focuses on the "how" of reform, 
that is, the specific benchmarks to implement these goals.
