SUBJECT: Zabul Justice System Shows New Signs of Life 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  In an August 6 public sentencing hearing attended 
by over 200 local and provincial officials and tribal elders, the 
invigorated Zabul Court of Appeals handed down five death and 
fourteen life sentences to a group charged with murdering ten people 
and wounding six more in Shajoy District.  Zabul Governor Arman and 
Zabul's newly-installed judges and prosecutors intended the event as 
a demonstration of their determination to prosecute criminal 
defendants under the law.  Increased public confidence in a more 
efficient justice system could increase willingness to turn in 
criminals and insurgents and strengthen rule of law and provincial 
security.  End Summary. 
 
Justice Sector Reform in Zabul 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) In early 2008, the Supreme Court reformed the criminal 
justice system in Zabul by replacing Zabul's two reportedly timid 
judges with five experienced, qualified judges, all of whom reside 
in Qalat.  They include:  Chief Judge (President of the Zabul Court 
of Appeals) Mohammed Hakim Kunarai, Judge Akhtar Mohammed (President 
of the Civil Court), Judge Eid Mohammed (President of the Public 
Security, i.e., NDS Court), Judge Mohammed Salim (President of the 
Qalat City Court), and Judge Abdul Ali Baluch (Member of the Public 
Security Court).  The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) also sent a new 
Chief Prosecutor (i.e. Attorney General), Hajji Seraj, to Zabul to 
replace the former provincial Attorney General.  Though new Chief 
Judge Hakim stresses the judiciary's independence, he maintains 
cordial relationships with Governor Delbar Jan Arman and Deputy 
Governor Gulab Shah Alikhel.  The three agree the rejuvenated 
justice system needs to prosecute and sentence, or if found not 
guilty, release the more than fifty insurgent suspects currently 
held at the Zabul Provincial Prison and NDS detention facility. 
 
First Sentences Delivered at Orchestrated Hearing 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶3. (U) Judge Hakim presided over the Court of Appeals' first 
sentencing hearing, with Judges Mohammed Salim and Akhtar Mohammed 
comprising the rest of the Supreme Court-mandated three-judge panel. 
 Prosecutors Abdur Rahim and Atiquallah represented the MoJ.  The 
Deputy Governor, Provincial Chief of Police COL Mohammed Yaqoub, 
Chair of the Provincial Council (PC) Hajji Mohammed Hashem, other PC 
members, several line ministry department directors, and over 200 
tribal elders, including 15 mullahs, attended the hearing.  An 
Ariana TV crew from Kandahar filmed the proceedings, and several 
local journalists, along with Zabul's Youth, Information and Culture 
Director, Bismallah Loddin, also recorded the event. 
 
¶4. (U) Hakim summarized the case and the charges against the 
defendants.  The ANP apprehended a total of 30 suspects in 
connection with the August 10, 2006 murders of 10 Shajoy District 
residents and the wounding of six others.  According to ANP reports, 
the defendants murdered the victims and stole a vehicle and personal 
property.  At the time of their arrest, the ANP found guns and 
ammunition in the suspects' possession; some of the defendants' 
clothes also bore blood stains.  The group's leader, Habibullah, 
made several attempts to explain the weapons and ammunition, but the 
ANP refuted each.  Ultimately, the group confessed, but denied any 
Taliban connections. 
 
¶5. (U) Habibullah and one of the victims' fathers were permitted to 
make statements to the court.  Habibullah admitted he was a thief 
but claimed he was innocent of the murders and had no Taliban 
connections.  He offered no evidence, but directed accusatory 
statements at others, such as claiming the ANP who arrested him were 
Taliban.  Following Habibullah's statement, one of the victims' 
fathers said the defendants' families did not know each other and no 
personal or tribal vendettas were involved in the murders.  He also 
claimed Habibullah and the other defendants were Taliban and 
suggested all 19 be publicly beheaded. 
 
¶6. (U) Following a 20 minute closed door deliberation, Judge Hakim 
pronounced all 19 defendants guilty. He said he considered the role 
each individual played when deciding their sentences.  He sentenced 
Habibullah and four other defendants to death, and the other 
fourteen to life in prison.  He noted he would have sentenced one 
more defendant to death, but was legally unable because that 
individual was under 18 years of age at the time of the crime.

Corruption Still a Factor 
------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) During private meetings, the Deputy Governor and Judge 
Hakim both indicated corruption played a role in the case.  The 
Deputy Governor said ANP or MOJ corruption might have led to the 
release of four of the suspects, escape of two, and caused one 
suspect to go "missing."  Judge Hakim, speaking to PRTOff the day 
before the sentencing, claimed that an anonymous caller had offered 
him USD 60,000 to release all 19 defendants. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Despite indications of corruption, the case and hearing 
were a giant leap forward for rule of law in Zabul province.  The 
PRT will track public sentiment about this case and others to 
determine their impact among popular conceptions of rule of law. 
Improved perceptions of the Zabul judicial system could encourage 
locals to pass tips to ANP and NDS officers, increasing the justice 
system's ability to prosecute criminals and unlawful anti-government 
elements.
