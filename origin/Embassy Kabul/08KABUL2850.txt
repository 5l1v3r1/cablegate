GHAZNI,S CELL NETWORK REMAINS DOWN 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY: On October 21, Ghazni,s cell phone network shut 
down in response to Taliban threats.  As of October 25 the 
phones remain nonfunctional despite Ghazni Governor Mohammad 
Usman Usmani,s jailing of two local phone company executives 
and his promises to have the networks up and running again. 
End Summary. 
 
USMANI TAKES A STAND AGAINST TERRORISTS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  In an October 22 three-hour security meeting with 
provincial officials attended by the PRT, Usmani stressed 
that it was completely unacceptable for the cell phone 
networks to bow to Taliban demands, and informed those 
present that he had met with the owners of the networks in 
Ghazni and made it clear to them that if they did not have 
the networks up and running by the following morning, he 
would have them jailed and their offices locked.  Usmani 
expressed fears that if the Taliban are able to shut down the 
cell phone towers in the District Centers, it could enable 
them to carry out a "spectacular attack in Ghazni City." 
 
¶3.  Usmani noted that over 300 people had come to his 
residence that day to complain about the cell phone network 
being down.  "Business is being stopped, and people are 
losing millions," he stressed.  "If we cannot defend the 
rights of the people, then there is no difference between us 
and the Taliban," he said, adding, "I have warned the 
companies to turn on the network or I will lock them out of 
their offices.  They are listening to the enemy, not the 
government." 
 
¶4.  Usmani also issued a "letter of guarantee" to all cell 
phone providers in Ghazni province, essentially promising 
them that they would be protected.  He didn,t specify how 
this would happen, and ANA 2nd Brigade Commander 203rd said 
October 22 that he didn't have enough ANA to protect all the 
cell phone towers. 
 
¶5.  On October 24, Governor Usmani reported to DOS PRTOFF 
that two of the local cell phone executives have been jailed: 
the executive for Afghan BSM, and the executive for Ensalat. 
As of October 26, PRTOFF understands that the executives 
remain in jail, and the phone network remains 
non-operational.  Sources in Ghazni say that the network must 
be restarted from Kabul, which may account for the delay. 
(PRT Note:  It is unclear what lawful authority Governor is 
relying upon to jail these executives.  It is also unclear as 
to what crimes, if any, the executives are suspected of 
committing.)
