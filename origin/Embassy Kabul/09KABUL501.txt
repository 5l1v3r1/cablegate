Islamic Republic of Afghanistan 
Independent Election Commission 
In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful 
Statement of the Independent Election Commission regarding 
the determination of the date of holding the presidential and 
provincial council elections 
04 March 09 
According to article 156 of the Constitution, the Independent 
Election Commission of Afghanistan has been established to 
administer and supervise elections in Afghanistan. 
During the preparation for conducting the next round of 
elections in Afghanistan, the IEC had a series of discussions 
with different stakeholders including respected Members of 
Parliament, His Excellency the President, and jihadi leaders. 
 After these meetings on the 7th of April 2008, in the 
presence of His Excellency the President, His Excellency the 
Chief Justice, respected Speakers of both Houses, respected 
Chief Prosecutor, and jihadi leaders, the decision was made 
that the presidential and provincial council elections should 
be conducted in the fall of 2009 and the Wolesi Jirga and 
district council elections should be conducted in the summer 
of 2010. 
The IEC, based on this decision, started its practical 
activities for facilitating a transparent, general, fair, 
secret and direct election in the country.  The voter 
registration process was conducted in four phases across the 
country and more than 4.5 million new voters registered, out 
of which more than 38% are female voters. 
The Independent Election Commission, considering the climate, 
budgetary, security and operational challenges announced the 
date of presidential and provincial council elections for the 
20th of August 2009. 
On the 27th of February 2009, His Excellency the President 
issued a decree and, based on the decree, the Commission was 
advised to conduct general, secret, fair and direct elections 
throughout Afghanistan. 
The climate, security, budgetary and operational challenges 
have not yet been solved.  The IEC is preparing to conduct 
transparent, fair, secret and general elections, which will 
be acceptable to the people of Afghanistan and the 
international community and legitimize the system based on 
the previous decision. 
The IEC will continue to share its concerns about solving 
these challenges with other national authorities.
