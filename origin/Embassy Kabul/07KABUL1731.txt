¶I. SUMMARY 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: The new Border Management Task Force (BMTF) 
Director, and the Finance and Metrics Coordinator, and the Customs 
Systems Coordinators are expected to arrive between mid-May and 
early June.  These positions are located at the U.S. Embassy in 
Kabul.  In addition, six mentors who will be responsible for 
mentoring Afghan Border Police (ABP) and Customs Police and Customs 
officials are expected to arrive in-country in mid-June.  The BMTF 
and USAID are in the process of exploring procedures by which USAID 
Customs Advisor contractors with Bearing Point would hire additional 
advisors to augment the BMTF's efforts.  The BMTF representative 
from the Afghan Engineering District (AED), U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, has been assisting in a site survey of the Spin 
Boldak/Weesch border crossing in anticipation of obtaining donor 
funding to construct a more secure BCP at Weesch on the Pakistan 
border in Kandahar Province. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Border Management Initiative (BMI) Executive Steering 
Committee (ESC) met and discussed the status of presenting the 
Presidential Decree to President Karzai for the establishment of the 
Border Management Commission within the Government of Afghanistan 
(GoA).  The BMTF construction project at the Islam Qalah BCP, funded 
by the Joint Interagency Coordination Group-Counter Narcotics 
(JIACG-CN), is estimated to be completed in July 2008.  JIACG-CN is 
also funding the $11 million BCP project at the Shir Khan Bandar BCP 
in Kunduz Province.  AED will oversee this project, which includes 
the construction of a similar BCP on the Tajikistan side at Nizhny 
Pyandzh.  A meeting with officials from the U.S. Embassy in 
Ashgabat, Turkmenistan centered on the development of an 
Afghan-Turkmenistan Cross-Border Communication Program at the Imam 
Nazar BCP in Turkmenistan and the Aquina BCP in Afghanistan.  The 
BMTF is coordinating with the Italian Embassy to recruit 10 Guardia 
di Finanza officers in Herat to teach Customs courses to Customs 
personnel at the Kabul Customs Training Facility.  EXBS procured 
three x-ray scanners for use at Kabul and Mazar airports. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
II. ITEMS OF BROAD INTEREST. 
¶3.   (U) The BMTF is moving forward with the expected arrival 
between mid-May and early June of the new Director, Finance and 
Metrics Coordinator, and the Customs Systems Coordinator.  These 
positions are located at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.  Six mentors, 
who will be responsible for mentoring Afghan Border Police (ABP) and 
Customs Police and Customs officials, are expected to arrive 
in-country in mid-June.  The mentors consist of former Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP) Border Patrol Agents and Customs/Immigration 
Officers.  The mentor teams will be split between the Torkham BCP in 
Nangarhar Province and the Islam Qalah BCP in Herat Province.  The 
funding for these positions and associated support is provided by 
the Joint Interagency Coordination Group-Counter Narcotics 
(JIACG-CN) from CENTCOM. 
¶4.  (U) Recent departures from the BMTF include the Assistant 
Director and the Customs Systems Coordinator.  The Strategic Planner 
and EXBS Advisor positions will be vacated at the end of May. 
Replacements for these positions are expected in June and July 2007. 
 
¶5.  (U) The BMTF and USAID are in the process of establishing 
procedures by which USAID Customs Advisor contractors with Bearing 
Point would hire four additional Bearing Point Customs advisors to 
 
KABUL 00001731  002.2 OF 004 
 
 
augment the BMTF's efforts in support of the Afghan Customs 
Department (ACD). Two of these advisors would deploy to the 
Jalalabad Inland Container Depot that serves the Torkham BCP.  The 
other two advisors would deploy to the Herat ICD that serves the 
Islam Qalah BCP.  Their function would be to mentor/advise on-site 
ACD staff and provide direct communication, coordination and support 
to BMTF mentor teams in Torkham and Islam Qalah.  BMTF has also 
requested that USAID consider hiring a fifth Customs Advisor through 
Bearing Point to be housed in Kabul with the BMTF to provide 
coordination between the field mentors/advisors, their respective 
chains of command, and the ACD in Kabul. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  The BMTF representative from the Afghan Engineering 
District (AED), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, has been assisting the 
ACD in a site survey of the Spin Boldak/Weesch BCP location in 
anticipation of obtaining donor funding to construct a more secure 
BCP at Weesch, on the Pakistan border in Kandahar Province. 
Security, smuggling, and infrastructure issues, stemming from the 
lack of construction space for a suitable BCP, prompted the BMTF 
Strategic Planner and the AED representative to meet with U.S. and 
Pakistan officials in Islamabad, Pakistan, to explain the need for a 
corresponding BCP in Pakistan, and potentially a joint BCP, adjacent 
to Weesch.  Pakistan officials were in agreement with the concept 
and future meetings are expected to follow through with the 
suggestion. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The Director General for ACD informed the BMTF that he 
will be meeting with World Bank representatives in May to discuss 
World Bank funding of the Weesch BCP and the Khowst ICD in Khost 
Province.  Typically, the World Bank utilizes the services of UNOPS 
to construct such a project.  However, BMTF will make the services 
of the AED representative available to impart information developed 
thus far to assist in the construction of the Weesch BCP.  The need 
for this new BCP is also being championed by ISAF to better secure 
the free flow of human and commercial traffic from Pakistan through 
this area.  News reporting of Taliban insurgents and illegal weapon 
trafficking suggests this area is a favored entry point of the 
Anti-Coalition Forces (ACF).  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has 
earmarked $5 million to equip the Weesch BCP after its 
construction. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The Border Management Initiative (BMI) Executive Steering 
Committee (ESC) met and discussed the status of presenting the 
Presidential Decree to President Karzai for the establishment of the 
Border Management Commission within the Government of Afghanistan 
(GoA).  The minister for MoF stated he will take the necessary steps 
to make a formal presentation of the decree to the President.  This 
Commission is designed to mirror the goals and associated activities 
of the BMI enabling the GoA to take ownership of its border 
management initiatives.  At issue during this meeting were the roles 
of GoA ministries at the border and in part the lack of mutual 
support and misunderstandings between MoF and MoI at the BCPs. 
Although the MoI and MoF are in agreement of their respective roles, 
the BMTF has scheduled a meeting between the Director General of ACD 
and the Commanding General of MoI to further discuss the new border 
strategy as it affects the BCPs.  In this meeting the drafting of 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and Memorandums of Understanding 
(MoU), as they pertain to new strategies agreed upon by all parties, 
will be discussed.  A Deputy Minister level BMI Working Group 
meeting is scheduled for mid-May for further discussion of topics 
addressed at the ESC. 
 
 
KABUL 00001731  003.2 OF 004 
 
 
¶9.  (SBU) The BMTF construction project at the Islam Qalah BCP, 
funded by the Joint Interagency Coordination Group-Counter Narcotics 
(JIACG-CN), is estimated to be completed in July 2008. The cost will 
be $15 million.  Issues such as the illegal fuel distribution being 
conducted at the direction of the Herat Provincial Governor threaten 
continued progress.  The BMTF met with Civil Affairs teams and 
Elders in the villages surrounding Islam Qalah BCP to discuss 
options in mitigating negative impacts on the local economy.  By 
involving the local villages, BMTF hopes to preclude the development 
of any problems that may arise during the construction of the BCP 
that will certainly have impact on the local population. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) JIACG-CN is also funding the $11 million BCP project at 
the Shir Khan Bandar BCP in Kunduz Province.  AED will oversee this 
project which includes the construction of a similar BCP on the 
Tajikistan side at Nizhny Pyandzh.  Completion of theses 2 BCPs is 
expected to be at the end of this year.  The EC will be constructing 
a $10 million Euro commercial depot in connection with the U.S. 
funded BCPs for clearance and storage of goods by the ACD.  A ground 
breaking ceremony for this site will be scheduled in May by the EC. 
The U.S. funded $35 million Afghan-Tajik Bridge being constructed by 
AED at Shir Khan is scheduled to be complete in August. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) The BMTF, GPPO, CSTC-A, and INL Police Mentor 
representatives conducted a meeting with U.S. Embassy officials from 
Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, the Turkmenistan Consul General and the 
Turkmenistan Deputy Minister of National Security.  Turkmenistan 
Embassy personnel included the EXBS Advisor, Econ and the Defense 
Attach.  The meeting centered on the development of an 
Afghan-Turkmenistan Cross-Border Communication Program at the Imam 
Nazar BCP in Turkmenistan and the Aquina BCP in Afghanistan.  In 
addition, the BMTF was able to conduct an Aquina BCP (Faryab 
Province) Recon and Assessment of the BCP infrastructure.  The 
European Commission is slated to provide the funding for a new BCP 
facility at Aquina and the Heratan BCP in Balkh Province. 
 
¶12.  (SBU) The BMTF is coordinating with the Italian Embassy to 
recruit the Guardia di Finanza in Herat to teach Customs courses to 
Customs personnel at the Kabul Customs Training Facility.  Afghan 
Customs currently has little capacity to conduct a comprehensive 
course for its staff of over 1900 officers.  The Guardia di Finanza 
is well qualified to conduct courses for Afghan Customs, but 
currently insist on teaching Customs related topics to the Afghan 
Border Police in the Herat INL Regional Training Center. 
Discussions with the Italian Embassy DCM are progressing on the 
alteration of the Guardia di Finanza's course of instruction to be 
directed more towards ABP duties, including immigration procedures. 
The BMTF met with the Italian Embassy Defense Attach who stated 
that the Italian government is willing to provide 10 additional 
Guardia di Finanza instructors to train Customs officials in Kabul 
if they would be allowed to teach in a secure training facility 
located next to the Italian military compound in Kabul.  This 
facility is currently being used by the Afghan National Army for 
training being conducted by the U.S. military.  The BMTF is making 
inquiries in an effort to secure classrooms and barracks for the 
students. 
 
¶13.  (SBU) EXBS is in receipt of 3 Rapidscan X-Ray scanners, 2 of 
which will be employed at the Kabul International Airport (KIA) to 
screen hand baggage, cargo and hold baggage placed on commercial 
carriers.  The third scanner will be employed at the Mazar-E-Sharif 
international airport in Balkh Province to scan cargo and hold 
 
KABUL 00001731  004.2 OF 004 
 
 
baggage.  The German Police Project Office (GPPO) is in receipt of 2 
additional Rapidscan X-Ray scanners to be placed inside the Mazar 
airport terminal for scanning passengers and hand baggage.  GPPO 
recently provided similar scanners for use at the Herat 
international airport in Herat Province.  EXBS also procured one of 
two 40 ton cranes for use by the ACD.  The crane that has been 
purchased is currently being retrofitted for use at the Kabul 
Customhouse.
