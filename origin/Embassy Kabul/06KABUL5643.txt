REF: KABUL 5547 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) After a week of Hajj flight operations, the GoA 
has indicated that currently-leased aircraft are meeting 
the demands of Afghanistan's Hajj and can be expected to 
function properly through the first phase, i.e., getting 
Hajjis to Jeddah over the next three weeks.  While some 
substantial issues remain (particularly the SAG's ability 
to issue adequate numbers of visas in time to fill the 
Afghan flights), these are being addressed separately. 
Embassy appreciates the support from the Department, NATO, 
and NATO capitals and confirms that all can stand down from 
efforts to obtain standby airlift support for the Afghans 
(pursuant to reftel instruction from the Department).
