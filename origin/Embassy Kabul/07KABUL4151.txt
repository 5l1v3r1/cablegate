SUBJECT:  UNAMA Proposal for Regular Quarterly Meetings of G-8 
Political Directors in JCMB Format on Afghanistan 
 
¶1. This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 6. 
 
¶2.  United Nations Assistance Mission for Afghanistan (UNAMA) 
Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG) Tom Koenigs 
convened a meeting of the "informal donors group" (also known as 
"tea club") to hear his proposal that the G-8 Political Directors in 
JCMB format discuss Afghanistan on a quarterly basis.  Koenigs noted 
that the first such G-8 Political Directors meeting in Berlin in 
February 2007 had been a great success, and another G-8 political 
directors meeting on Afghanistan has been scheduled in Tokyo on 
February 5 from 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.  (The phrase "in the JCMB 
format" refers to the JCMB co-chairs, the UNAMA SRSG and the senior 
Afghan JCMB senior Economic Advisor to President Karzai, joining the 
G-8 group for the discussion on Afghanistan.) 
 
¶3.  Koenigs said that he thinks quarterly meetings would be 
especially effective in facilitating and improving the coordination 
between missions in the field in Afghanistan and the views of 
headquarters in the capitals.  He added parenthetically that he 
knows of issues where the Kabul field missions have achieved 
consensus, only to see the capitals go off in divergent directions. 
He feels that if the G-8 Political Directors can focus on the Afghan 
situation on a quarterly basis for two or three hours immediately 
following their regular G-8 meetings, then they will become better 
informed about the rapidly evolving Afghan situation.  They will 
bring this information with them back to capitals, while improving 
integration with their Kabul missions. 
 
¶4.  In turn, the political directors can facilitate an integrated 
international approach to the three main JCMB pillars of security, 
good governance, and economic and social development. 
 
¶5.  Koenigs asked Tea Club members for a response to his proposal to 
establish quarterly G-8 Political Directors meetings on Afghanistan 
by Monday, December 24.  Koenigs also announced that he will be 
leaving Kabul at the end of December, and that the UN has yet to 
announce his successor. 
 
¶6.  Action Requested:  The Department is requested to provide 
guidance on how to respond to Koenig's proposal.
