OFFICIAL SCHOOL OPENING 
 
¶1. (SBU) District Governor Mullah Salam officially opened the Musa 
Qala Central School on February 28.  Several hundred students and 
dozens of citizens watched Salam open the school and deliver an 
excellent speech that focused on the importance of education.  Salam 
urged the students to take care of their school and asked the 
citizens to respect and protect their teachers.  He thanked the 
international community for its support but said more must be done 
in Musa Qala, and the people of Kajaki should now enjoy the same 
benefits.  Salam welcomed the provincial government representatives 
and praised the work of the Musa Qala Shura in preparation for the 
event and the opening of the school. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Representatives from the Ministries of Education and Rural 
Rehabilitation and Development and the Helmand provincial council 
echoed Salam's words and promised continuing support for the people 
of Musa Qala.  Residents told PRTOff they appreciated the new school 
and were pleased it was repaired so quickly.  They said their 
children liked the equipment provided by USAID's Local Governance 
and Community Development Program and looked forward to more books 
and study material.  Other residents said they now hoped more 
schools could be opened in neighboring villages because some of the 
children were traveling a long way to attend classes in the city. 
Several teachers said the school was very popular, and they expected 
the enrollment to soon exceed 600 students. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Salam told PRTOff that he insisted on a formal opening to 
show local residents that things are progressing.  He clearly 
understands the need for these types of public events and prefers 
this style to maintain his support.  The PRT welcomed the school's 
formal opening to maintain reconstruction momentum and is working to 
start construction on the Central Mosque and other projects in Musa 
Qala.
