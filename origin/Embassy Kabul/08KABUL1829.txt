SUBJECT: HELMAND UPDATE: NEW GOVERNOR BRINGS IMPROVEMENTS, MARINES 
ENGAGE TALIBAN 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Since his arrival in March 2008, Governor Gulab 
Mangal has been a force for positive change in Helmand province. 
Mangal is a capable bureaucrat and has an excellent grasp of the 
political and security challenges facing Helmand.  He is building a 
competent administration, and is determined to bring government 
closer to the people.  The deployment of the 24th Marine 
Expeditionary Unit (MEU) allowed the U.K.-led Task Force Helmand 
(TFH) to conduct large clearing operations in central Helmand.  The 
Marines defeated enemy forces around Garmsir district and restored 
government control.  Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) continue 
to expand and improve their capabilities but lack sufficient numbers 
to control all cleared areas across the province.  Reconstruction 
and development (R&D) work has expanded, and the Provincial 
Reconstruction Team (PRT) and USAID regularly coordinate with the 
Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) to improve 
project implementation.  End Summary. 
 
Marines and Focused District 
Development Improve Security 
---------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Poor security remains the biggest problem in Helmand, but 
the deployment of the 24th MEU and 2nd Battalion 7th Marines to 
Regional Command South, mainly in Helmand, brought needed support to 
TFH and the ANSF respectively.  The 24th MEU, with approximately 
2300 Marines, successfully cleared enemy forces from Garmsir 
district, while the approximately 1300 Marines of the 2/7 are 
mentoring the Afghan police in five districts.  (NOTE:  "Marine 2/7" 
police mentoring efforts are being closely coordinated with the 
Focused District Development (FDD) police development program led by 
the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan, as well as the 
In-District Reform program that complements FDD.)  TFH and the ANSF 
conducted military operations around Gereshk, Sangin and Musa Qala 
and disrupted enemy forces preparing for the spring offensive.  The 
Afghan National Army (ANA) is well received by Helmand residents and 
continues to improve its capabilities.  The ANA played a large role 
in spring military operations, and can successfully backfill cleared 
areas in Helmand if it receives sustained mentoring from TFH. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Afghan National Police (ANP) successfully supported 
counter-narcotic efforts and disrupted multiple suicide attacks and 
other criminal activities.  The PRT has eight Police Mentoring Teams 
working to improve the ANP's tactical, management and leadership 
capabilities.  General Andiwol, Helmand Chief of Police, is a 
positive influence on the entire force, and his regular travel to 
the districts has improved ANP performance and image. 
 
Development: Improved Coordination 
---------------------------------- 
¶4. (U) The PRT, USAID and the Afghan government improved their 
coordination of development projects, and began numerous new 
projects across the province.  The town of Musa Qala received 
significant investment for medical, education and government 
buildings.  Gereshk district saw expanded development activity from 
both the government and the PRT.  USAID's Alternative Development 
Program operated effectively in the area around Lashkar Gah, and 
with improved security can expand to other areas of Helmand. 
 
Governance: Governor Mangal Takes Charge 
---------------------------------------- 
¶5. (SBU) Governor Mangal became governor in March 2008 (he 
previously served as Governor of Laghman and Paktika provinces) and 
quickly established himself as the dominant political force in 
Helmand.  He immediately met with Helmand's political leadership, 
and stressed that his administration would improve security, fight 
corruption, bring government closer to the people and improve 
service delivery.  The PRT and the Afghan government provided 
technical support staff to support him.  The Provincial Development 
Committee has met regularly, and the Provincial Council has 
supported the Governor's outreach efforts.  Mangal has improved the 
image and operations of Helmand's provincial government; however, at 
the district level, capacity is extremely weak and significant work 
is needed to improve it. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: Governor Mangal's efforts to expand the capacity 
of provincial and district governance is exactly what was needed to 
complement the real military progress achieved by TFH, the ANSF and 
the U.S. Marines.  Mangal has managed Helmand's complicated 
political strands to gain support for governance reform efforts, and 
he has strong backing from the central government.  Security remains

the greatest challenge to Helmand residents, but now residents have 
a governor who can improve their physical safety and build real 
support for the GIRoA in Helmand.
