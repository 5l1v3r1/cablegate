¶1. (SBU) Post continues to track a group of 
approximately 1150 Koreans in country to participate 
in a peace rally and relief work. News reports 
characterize the groups as "Christian Evangelicals" 
and there has already been one Afghan demonstration in 
Mazar-e-Sharif to protest this event and the situation 
in Lebanon. Post believes that there is a significant 
threat towards this group and is working to inform 
American participants of the dangers. We have also 
convened the EAC, details Septel. 
 
¶2. (SBU) About 1150 Koreans are reported to have 
already entered Afghanistan. It is reported that there 
are approximately 300 in Herat, 400 in Bamyan, 170 in 
Kandahar, 50-80 in Mazar, and an indeterminate number 
(probably several hundred) in Kabul. There also 
appears to be a large number of children (5-15 y/o) 
included in these numbers. In Mazar over half of the 
participants are children. Millennium Pacific Icon 
Group is involved in coordinating Korean-American 
involvement. They report that 200-400 Korean-Americans 
will participate. It is also reported that Koreans of 
other nationalities may participate. 
 
¶3. (SBU) President Karzai is tracking the issue and 
has issued orders through the MFA and MOI. The MFA was 
ordered to stop issuing visas to Koreans in order to 
help prevent travel to the country. The MOI was also 
ordered to prevent additional members associated with 
the Korean groups from entering the country, but may 
have difficulty in doing so because of logistical and 
organizational limitations. The MOI has also been 
coordinating with Governors to gather information and 
limit the groups' activities for their own safety. 
Minister of Interior Zarar said that his ministry has 
begun planning its security response (See Septel). 
ISAF is working on its own contingency plans and is 
being urged to provide assistance to the ANP to 
prepare for possible scenarios. 
 
¶3. (SBU) PRTOff in Mazar-e Sharif reported that there 
was a demonstration, today, August 2, of approximately 
200 Afghans in response to the Korean group and the 
situation in Lebanon. (COMMENT: One Afghan told a 
mullah that he had been given a Bible by members of 
the group to read instead of the Koran. These claims 
are impossible to verify but speak to public 
perceptions of the group. END COMMENT.) PRTOff also 
went to visit the Institute for Asian Culture and 
Development office along with a representative from 
UNAMA. They saw approximately 20-30 children at the 
location, many of whom appeared to be sick but were 
being treated by doctors associated with the 
organization. There were two American citizens in the 
group, one adult female, and one child. PRTOff passed 
on the department's consular information to the adult 
and cautioned her about the dangers of being in 
Afghanistan. (PRT COMMENT: PRTOff repeatedly asked 
about where the parents of the children were, but did 
not receive a response. She suspects that they may be 
orphans traveling with guardians. END PRT COMMENT.) 
IACD representatives said that the rest of the group, 
approximately 150 people, had left for Bamyan by bus 
over the last two days.

¶4. (SBU) News reports increasingly characterize the 
group as being made up of evangelical Christians and 
suggest that they are being seen by the public as an 
affront to Islam. An article from the Korean Times 
quotes the group as saying they plan to engage in 
"volunteer services, missionary work, and cultural 
performances." All of the current media reports bill 
this event as having strong religious connections.  As 
a result, Afghans and Afghan authorities are extremely 
concerned. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Only a handful of Korean-Americans have 
registered with the Embassy for the period of August 
2-8. Post met with the event planners on July 31, and 
informed them that the Department of State has a 
Travel Warning for Afghanistan that urges American 
citizens not to travel to here and that the Department 
has also warned Americans against participating in 
large gatherings. Consul also made it clear that the 
Embassy would provide ACS, but may not be able to get 
anyone out of jail. Additionally, she noted that while 
Embassy understands their event is secular in nature, 
the GOA has not responded well to proselytism and that 
others have been arrested in the past on these 
grounds. Lastly, Consul provided organizers with 
copies of the Travel Warning, Worldwide Caution, and 
Consular Information Sheet. PolOff closed the meeting 
by strongly urging the group to inform all of their 
participants regarding the security situation and also 
to consider canceling all events. PolOff stressed that 
while the group leaders may have the best intentions 
it would be irresponsible not to put the safety and 
security of their members first. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Post will continue to engage all affected 
parties to promote a peaceful resolution to this 
situation. The Embassy's primary concern is for the 
safety of all who are involved and we are urging the 
GOA and ISAF to take the necessary precautions to 
avoid violence this weekend. Post will send out a 
warden message tomorrow to all American citizens, and 
will distribute hard copies to participants who may 
not have registered.
