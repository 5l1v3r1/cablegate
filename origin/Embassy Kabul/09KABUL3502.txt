SUBJECT: AFGHAN GOVERNMENT DECLARES H1N1 STATE OF EMERGENCY 
 
REF:  STATE 111924 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Afghanistan's Second Vice President Mohammad 
Karim Khalili declared a H1N1 state of emergency November 1 and 
announced all schools and universities will close for three weeks to 
prevent further spread of the disease.  More than 20 new cases of 
H1N1 have been reported in the last two weeks.  The Afghan 
Government has 51,000 doses of Tamiflu that have already been 
distributed to health care providers and has asked the international 
community for more.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a meeting with ministers and donors, Minister of Public 
Health Sayed Fatemie said 321 total cases of H1N1 flu have been 
reported in Afghanistan, including 271 cases among ISAF personnel, 
who have recovered.  (Note: while suspected cases among ISAF 
personnel may be in this range, confirmed cases are substantially 
lower.)  A 35-year-old man died October 28, the first Afghan 
fatality from H1N1.  Three of his family members contracted the 
disease, as well as three medical providers in the hospital where he 
was treated.  The surge in reported cases led the government to 
declare a three-week state of emergency.  In addition to school 
closures, Fatemie said the government will ask Afghans to limit 
large gatherings such as weddings and encourage people to stay home 
if they are feeling sick.  Afghan media were present at the meeting 
and reported on the state of emergency.  Media reports said there 
are 551 cases of suspected H1N1 flu. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) has approximately 
51,000 doses of Tamiflu that it has distributed to around 100 health 
facilities in eight regions of the country.  If there is a serious 
H1N1 outbreak, MPH estimates it will need 270,000 doses to treat 
patients.  It has asked USAID and other donors for Tamiflu, the H1N1 
vaccine, beds, blankets and hospital equipment to cope with the 
outbreak.  MOPH estimates it needs $125 million from donors to 
address this epidemic, including $61 million to combat this first 
outbreak.  (Note: Afghanistan is eligible to receive U.S.-donated 
H1N1 vaccines through the World Health Organization.  USAID provided 
MOPH 35,000 seasonal influenza vaccines for Hajj pilgrims starting 
October 14, but media erroneously reported the vaccines were for 
H1N1.  End note.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post is in close touch with MOPH, as well as maintaining 
our close liaison with ISAF, and is evaluating ways to provide 
assistance.
