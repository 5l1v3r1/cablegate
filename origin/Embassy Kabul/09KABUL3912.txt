SUBJECT: PARLIAMENT SUMMONS MINISTERS TO REPORT ON REFUGEE 
ISSUES IN PAKISTAN 
 
1.(SBU) SUMMARY.  On November 16, the Wolesi Jirga, 
Parliament's lower house, summoned Kabir Farahi, the Deputy 
Minister of Foreign Affairs (MoFA), and Abdul Karim 
Barahowie, Minister of Refugees and Repatriation (MoRR), to 
brief Members of Parliament (MPs) on the planned closure of 
Durgai (aka Zangal Patai) refugee camp in Malakand District 
and the alleged mistreatment of Afghans in Pakistan.  After a 
spirited discussion, the Ministers were tasked to report to 
Parliament within one week on their plan to engage the 
Government of Pakistan (GoP) on these issues.  On November 
23, the Minister of MoRR reported that Pakistani authorities 
agreed not to close Durgai camp and that the residents would 
be allowed to stay until spring 2010.  The Deputy Minister of 
MoFA reported that the Pakistani authorities are abiding by 
their obligations with respect to registered Afghan refugees. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------- 
Refugee Camp Closure 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) MPs were puzzled about the proposed closures of 
Durgai camp if the camp was legal and were especially 
troubled because of the possibility of force return to 
Afghanistan.  Refugee camp representatives attending the 
Parliament session needed information to take back to the 
residents.  Minister Barahowie of the MoRR proceeded to thank 
Pakistan and Iran for hosting a large number of Afghans 
refugees for the past 30 years and noted that the GoP cannot 
deport a refugee holding a valid Proof of Registration card 
(PoR).  He also reported on his November 15 meeting with the 
representative of the United Nations High Commission for 
Refugees (UNHCR), resulting in a UNHCR visit to Pakistan on 
November 16 and 17.  (Comment: On his return to Kabul, the 
UNHCR representative reported to Embassy Refugee Coordinator 
that the camp in Malakand Division, North-West Frontier 
Province (NWFP), was insecure with ongoing fighting and that 
local Pakistanis were also being moved out of the area. 
There is a feasible relocation site and negotiations continue 
on delaying any return movement until next spring.  End 
Comment). 
 
¶3. (SBU) MPs expressed concern that the MoRR claims to be 
prepared to receive refugee returnees, but there is no plan 
in place for a crisis.  They noted that a permanent solution 
for returnees requires a plan and strategy that MoRR has not 
provided.  In addition, the current lives of refugees in 
Pakistan and Iran are far better than the lives of returnees. 
 Steps must be taken to keep Afghans in Afghanistan and the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) 
must start thinking about projects to create jobs. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Barahowie told the MPs that there are 59 MoRR 
townships in 34 provinces to which refugees can return, but 
only fourteen sites are active and MoRR has limited support 
for these Land Allocation Scheme (LAS) sites.  MPs responded 
that land alone cannot solve all the problems faced by 
returnees and that they need access to health care, 
education, and employment.  MPs again noted that a clear 
strategy is needed for returnees, with MoRR,s 
responsibilities and programs defined.  (Comment: Many of the 
LAS sites designated by MoRR are remote and lack 
infrastructure, potable water, and economic opportunities, 
thus making it difficult to support returnees.  End Comment). 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Alleged Mistreatment of Afghans in Pakistan 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The MPs spoke of the illegal arrest of Afghans in 
Pakistan and increased police harassment.  Minister Farahi 
of the MoFA responded that insecurity in Pakistan increases 
violation of Afghan refugee rights because they are a soft 
target for Pakistan police.  (Comment: Per the UNHCR 
representative, PoR holders who are arrested are usually 
released quite rapidly, demonstrating the usefulness of the 
card as a protection tool.  He also noted that there is no 
sign of large scale deportation despite the fact that there 
are large numbers of Afghans without documents in Pakistan. 
End Comment).

Next Steps

¶6. (U) After thanking the MPs for their participation, 
Speaker Qanuni noted that a clear strategy is needed to solve 
the problems of Afghan refugees and returnees.  He tasked the 
ministers to contact their counterparts in the GoP to (a) 
delay the closure of the refugee camp and (b) call a 
 
KABUL 00003912  002 OF 002 
 
 
tripartite commission meeting to discuss illegal arrests of 
Afghans.  (Comment: The UNCHR representative shared a readout 
of his visit to Pakistan with both ministers.  End Comment). 
 
-------------- 
One Week Later 
-------------- 
 
¶7. (U) Barahawie of the MoRR stated that an agreement was 
reached with GoP authorities not to close the refugee camp in 
NWFP.  Water and electricity, which had been cut off, were 
again available.  The residents have not been asked to 
repatriate and will be permitted to stay until spring 2010. 
 
¶8. (U) Farahi detailed MoFA,s contacts with the GoP, UNHCR 
authorities and officials in Kabul and Islamabad.  He 
highlighted the fact that the GoP is abiding by its 
obligations to registered Afghan refugees.  He also announced 
that there would be a Tripartite Commission meeting of the 
GOIRoA, GoP and UNHCR within in a month to conclude an 
extension of the Tripartite Agreement.  (Comment: The current 
Tripartite Agreement expires on December 31 and, per UNHCR, 
negotiations on the draft text of the proposed new agreement 
are ongoing in Kabul and Islamabad.  End Comment).
