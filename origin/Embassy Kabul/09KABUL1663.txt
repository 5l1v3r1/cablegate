REF:  Kabul 1662 
 
¶1.  (U) President Karzai has moved to develop a strong basis of 
support among female voters in Herat.  On June 22 he opened an 
electoral campaign center for women there, a sign of anticipation 
that he will need women's votes on election day.  Like his campaign 
office (reftel), the women's center is serving lunch and other 
refreshments daily.  Karzai's female outreach strategy appears to be 
working, and further adds to the general view that Karzai has 
co-opted the key ethnic and minority groups to support his campaign. 
 
 
¶2.  (U) Female candidates, on the other hand, continue to struggle, 
particularly with obtaining financial support for their campaigns 
and security.  According to UNAMA's human rights office, female 
candidates are unable to access some districts for security reasons, 
and must campaign in these districts through family members and 
associates.  One female candidate was forced to withdraw from the PC 
campaign prior to the finalization of the final PC candidate list 
after she received threats against her person and her daughters. 
She told UNAMA that she was too fearful to report the threats to the 
National Directorate of Security (NDS). 
 
¶3. (U) On a positive note, as a result of the June 17 roundtable 
discussion with Herat's Provincial Council involving Ambassador 
Eikenberry and Minister Atmar, female PC Member Shahnaz Ghowsi 
reported that security for female PC members had been restored at 
Minister Atmar's direction.  (Note: Originally, the MOI withdrew 
security for female incumbents seeking reelection, reasoning that 
providing such security would favor their current campaigns for a 
new term.  End Note.)  The U.S.-funded National Democratic Institute 
(NDI) will provide training to female candidates from all provinces 
in Kabul starting July 24, and candidates from Herat are expected to 
attend.  Additionally the International Republican Institute (IRI) 
said it is working with women's groups.
