Afghan National Police (ANP). The Ministry of Interior wishes to

of human rights violations.  (Note: UNAMA's summary of information 
is repeated for Department's information at para 4.  This 
information was collected as part of initial vetting of general 
officers last year; since it may be outdated, we have requested 
UNAMA to update its file.  Should additional information be received 
we will inform Department.  End note.)  Post request Department
