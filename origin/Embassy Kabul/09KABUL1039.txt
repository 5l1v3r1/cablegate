1.(SBU) FM Spanta will host Pakistani FM Qureshi and Iranian 
FM Mottaki at a 4/27 trilateral in Kabul, to prepare for a 
yet-to-be-scheduled trilateral heads of state meeting in 
Tehran.  MFA Senior Advisor Davood Marodian reported on 4/23 
that the MFA was approaching next week's meeting with some 
caution, as Pakistan and Iran have pressed to expand the 
proposed areas of trilateral cooperation beyond earlier 
agreed to areas like agriculture, transportation, and transit 
trade to include trilateral security issues like 
counterterrorism, border enforcement and military 
cooperation.  Afghanistan is less concerned about the 
possibility of trilateral counternarcotics collaboration. 
The MFA's view on trilateral security cooperation is 
influenced by the history of the two neighboring countries' 
roles in Afghanistan's internal and security affairs. 
 
¶2. (U) The three countries' heads of state agreed at the 3/11 
Economic Cooperation Organization meeting in Tehran to hold a 
trilateral summit in Tehran in May.  Marodian informed us 
that the three countries have not set an exact date for the 
summit meeting, but Iran was pushing hard to hold it some 
time before its June 12 presidential elections.  Marodian 
speculated President Ahmadinejad was seeking that timing to 
give him a political boost ahead of the election. 
 
¶3.  (U) Marodian reported that the three governments were now 
negotiating a joint statement that would emphasize trilateral 
politicial consultation and regional cooperation, with an 
emphasis on economic an cultural areas of common interest. 
As for the 4/27 events, the three foreign ministers will 
first meet jointly with President Karzai, then  hold separate 
bilateral meetings, and conclude the day with a trilateral 
plenary session.
