SUBJECT:  Competent Response to Pakistani Refugees From Bajaur 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  Beginning the week of August 6, Afghan refugee and 
Pakistani families living in Bajaur and Mohmand Tribal Agencies in 
Pakistan began fleeing into Afghanistan due to Pakistani military 
operations.  UNHCR estimates approximately 2,000-3,000 refugee 
families have crossed into Kunar province.  Media and UN estimates 
of internally displaced persons remaining in Pakistan ranges from 
50,000 to 300,000 but the number is likely closer to 200,000. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following Kunar Governor Wahidi's provincial government 
emergency management meeting, provincial authorities (Departments of 
Refugees and Repatriation, Rural Reconstruction and Development, 
Women's Affairs, Public Health, Afghan Red Crescent) and 
international organizations (UNHCR , UNICEF, WFP, ICRC) promptly 
verified numbers, distributed aid, and provided services to most of 
the  refugee families.  The Asadabad PRT had just restocked 
provincial authorities' food and material supplies and will provide 
more assistance if requested.  IROA and international assistance 
will continue for several days and food will be distributed in three 
weeks, if necessary.  Provincial authorities have handled the 
situation well, though there is some evidence of minor corruption 
regarding aid distribution, 
 
¶3. (SBU) Refugees have settled primarily with friends or family; no 
tent cities have sprung up.  The refugees have been mainly women and 
children, as most men have remained behind to fight or protect 
family compounds.  Approximately two-thirds of the families are 
Pakistani and one-third Afghan.  Post has asked provincial 
authorities not to highlight the refugees' citizenship or the 
"generous" Afghan assistance, for fear that many "Pakistanis" are 
actually Afghans living illegally in Pakistan, and the Pakistani 
government could refuse them re-entry once fighting stops.  All 
involved expect the refugees to return to their homes in Bajaur and 
elsewhere once the fighting subsides. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post is closely following UNHCR and ICRC aid distribution 
in Kunar, which is being carried out with PRM funds.  Both 
organizations believe they have sufficient resources to handle the 
current situation, provided it does not drag on for several months. 
 
 
¶5. (U) This cable is cleared by Embassy Islamabad.
