NEGOTIATIONS 
 
REF: ISLAMABAD 3012 
 
¶1. (SBU) Farooq Wardak, Minister of State for Parliamentary 
Affairs and a close advisor to President Karzai, told 
PolCouns negotiations on the Oct. 10-11 Peace Jirga between 
Karzai and new Pakistani President Zardari had been 
productive, with both presidents agreeing to expand the 
participants from 25 to 30 members on each side to 
accommodate more diverse representation from Pakistan. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Peace Jirga is a follow-up to a grand jirga held 
last year in Kabul.  Recent tensions in Afghanistan-Pakistan 
relations had held up preparations for the current jirga, but 
renewed efforts by Karzai, Zardari, and Pakistani Prime 
Minister Gilani to smooth over disagreements brought plans 
back on track, according to Wardak (reftel). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Wardak said when Pakistani officials presented a 
list of 25 names for their participants to the Afghan side, 
Karzai noted the absence of key Pashtun and Baluch leaders, 
including Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao (North West Frontier 
Province), Mahmood Khan Achakzai (Baluchistan), and Mandokhel 
(Balunchistan).  Wardak said the two Baluch leaders had 
called Karzai while the president was en route to Pakistan 
for meetings with Zaradari and Gilani to complain. Karzai 
pressed for their inclusion, and the Pakistanis agreed, 
upping the participant list to 30 to create room for the new 
names.  Of the original 25 Pakistani names, Wardak said 18 
were from North West Frontier Province, five from 
Baluchistan, and one each from Sindh and Punjab.
