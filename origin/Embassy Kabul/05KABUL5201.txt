SUBJECT: JAILED JOURNALIST ALI MOHAQIQ NASAB RELEASED WITH 
SUSPENDED SENTENCE 
 
REF: KABUL 4884 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  Jailed journalist Ali Mohaqiq Nasab was 
released from jail with a suspended six-month sentence. 
During the hearing Nasab gave a one-sentence apology 
stating, "I ask the court to forgive me if I caused any 
confusion and problem."  This statement appeased the court 
and the original two-year sentence was reduced to six- 
months, half of which will be suspended.  Nasab's reduced 
and suspended sentence was not welcomed by the prosecutor, 
who argued that Nasab should be sentenced to death for 
supporting conversion from Islam to other religions.   END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On December 21, the Appeal Court of Afghanistan 
held a public hearing on Nasab's case and reduced his two- 
year prison sentence to six-months.  Since Nasab had been 
incarcerated for the past three months the remaining three- 
months were suspended.  The court warned Nasab that over the 
next three months his behavior will be closely monitored and 
any violation of the law will result in his arrest and 
possible increase in jail time. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Comment.  The consensus of the international 
community members who attended the hearing is that Nasab's 
case was not a case about freedom of speech, but rather a 
case about freedom of religion.  End Comment.
