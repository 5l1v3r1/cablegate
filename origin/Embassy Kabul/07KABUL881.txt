¶I. SUMMARY 
 
¶1.   (SBU) SUMMARY:  The European Union (EU) has approved a plan for 
a European mission to Afghanistan aimed at enhancing training for 
the Afghan National Police.  The ESDP mission will strengthen the 
European contribution to police training, of which the largest part 
is now the German Police Program Office.  It will work closely with 
the U.S. effort as implemented by CSTC-A Police Reform Directorate 
by means of an International Police Coordination Board. The Italian 
Guardia di Finanza will continue to train border police in Herat 
Province and is being solicited by the Afghan Customs Department 
(ACD) to train their officials in Kabul.  The Border Management Task 
Force (BMTF) has submitted a proposal to DOS/INL requesting support 
and related costs for the BMTF mentorship program at the Islam Qalah 
Border Crossing Point (BCP).  BMTF is addressing security issues at 
the Islam Qalah BCP construction site with CSTC-A and the Government 
of Afghanistan (GoA).  The ACD recognizes and is taking the 
initiative to improve the economic development at the BCPs by 
working with other ministries to develop a comprehensive development 
plan.  The BMI Working Group met with representatives from each of 
the neighboring country Embassies to attend and discuss border 
issues affecting their relationship with Afghanistan.  The 
participating countries were Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and 
Tajikistan. The BMTF Border Police Coordinator has drafted follow-up 
recommendations of the Afghan Border Police's (ABP) new mobile 
strategy detailing the developing infrastructure, equipping and 
integrated border specific technology when implementing this new 
strategy. A small team representing the BMTF and the Afghan 
Engineering Department (AED) traveled to Regional Command-South 
(RC-South) on two separate occasions to conducted briefings with 
RC-South border stakeholders outlining current and planned 
infrastructure projects. END SUMMARY. 
 
II. ITEMS OF BROAD INTEREST. 
 
¶2.   (U) On February 12, 2007 EU foreign ministers approved a plan 
for a European mission to Afghanistan aimed at training and 
mentoring the Afghan police units. The European team will operate in 
the Afghan capital Kabul and in five other regions, with an 
estimated cost of 40 million euros in 2007.  The 70 additional 
officers are expected to arrive in Afghanistan by May or June 2007 
and combined with the 90 currently in country, will comprise the EU 
projected mission of 160 police officers.  The EU has been 
considering sending such a mission for several months, under 
pressure from NATO which has called on the bloc to do more in 
Afghanistan.  NATO chief Jaap de Hoop Scheffer has suggested that 
the 27 EU nations take charge of police training while NATO, 
concerned at the increase in armed resistance from the Taliban, 
concentrate their efforts on aiding the Afghan army.  The EU foreign 
ministers, in their draft agreement, also stress their wish to 
continue collaborating with the Afghan government "to stabilize and 
reconstruct this country" in the development field as well as in 
security issues. 
¶3.  (SBU)  Another newcomer to Afghanistan, the Italian Guardia di 
Finanza (GdF), a law enforcement agency charged with protecting the 
economic stability of Italy whose experience extends to customs and 
border enforcement processes and procedures, has recently completed 
a training course for the Afghan Border Police (ABP) at the 
DOS/INL/DynCorp Regional Training Center (RTC) in Herat.  Although 
the Border Management Task Force at the US Embassy requested a copy 
of their curriculum prior to any training, it wasn't received until 
the completion of their first course of instruction.  Unfortunately, 
it was discovered that the course material consisted primarily of 
Customs processes and procedures.  Although members of the Border 
Management Initiative (BMI) requested the GdF to train Customs 
officials in Kabul, the GdF insisted on residing in the Herat 
Province and training border police at the RTC in Herat. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  In January 2007 the GdF were advised that the RTC would 
 
KABUL 00000881  002.2 OF 004 
 
 
experience an increase in basic police training for the Afghan 
National Civil Order Police (ANCOP) and the Afghan National 
Auxiliary Police (ANAP) prohibiting them from initiating a 2nd 
course of instruction.  BMI contacted the Italian Embassy and 
suggested the GdF be relocated to Kabul to teach their curriculum to 
Customs officials. However, CSTC-A PRD and DOS/INL have found a way 
to accommodate the Italians at the Herat RTC. Efforts are underway 
to assure the GdF develop a curriculum that is in keeping with the 
needs of the ABP and the Customs Police.  In the interim, the Afghan 
Customs Department (ACD) is preparing a proposal to the Italian 
Embassy requesting additional GdF personnel be sent to Kabul to 
train Customs officers. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  In January 2007 the BMTF met with DynCorp representatives 
in an attempt to get estimates on the costs associated with housing 
BMTF mentors at the INL/DynCorp Islam Qalah Border Training Facility 
(BTF), formerly called the FOB.  To date, these figures have not 
been received by the BMTF because DOS/INL required a proposal 
request for their support of the BMTF mentorship program prior to 
furnishing these costs.  The BMTF has complied with this request and 
expects a decision in the near future by DOS/INL regarding their 
ability to support the BMTF mentors and the related costs.  The BTF 
is currently in the 2nd and final phase of construction which is 
expected to be completed in May or June 2007.  If allowed, the BMTF 
mentors would be scheduled to arrive when this construction phase is 
complete. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  As reported in January's cable a continuing problem 
exists at the Islam Qalah Border Crossing Point (BCP) involving a 
fuel dump operation sanctioned by the Herat Province Governor which 
is operating illegally within the confines of the BCP.  Because of 
the presence of approximately 12 DOS/INL/DynCorp mentors and 
contractors working on a $15 million project funded by the United 
States at this BCP, a mutually agreeable solution for moving the 
operation outside the BCP facility is being discussed between the 
BMTF, CSTC-A and the GoA. BMTF has contacted various humanitarian 
organizations to direct their attention to the conditions of the 
local population surrounding the BCP in an attempt to garner their 
support. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The areas around the various BCPs cannot be ignored.  In 
the long term, if the BCPs are to be successful the areas 
surrounding them must also be developed.  This effort will be led by 
the ACD and will be supported by the Ministries of Urban Development 
and Rural Rehabilitation and Development.  In order to achieve 
development around the BCPs, a comprehensive plan must be developed 
and implemented for each of the communities surrounding the BCPs. 
Coordination and cooperation with the Government of Afghanistan's 
initiatives must occur to take advantage of other initiatives that 
target the areas surrounding BCPs. Additionally, the ACD must work 
with the international development community to coordinate 
pre-existing projects in the BCP areas and plan for comprehensive 
development of those areas. Finally, when the ACD has determined the 
inputs necessary to achieve these goals, they must also arrange for 
donor contributions to bridge any remaining shortfalls. The BMI is 
assisting in this endeavor through the coordination of all its 
members and has reached out to the humanitarian community as well to 
inform them of these initiatives to gain and coordinate their 
support. 
¶8.  (SBU)  On February 27, 2007 the ACD hosted the BMI Working Group 
meeting which brings together all the stakeholders involved in the 
border regions.  The ACD invited representatives from each of the 
neighboring country Embassies to attend and discuss border issues 
affecting their relationship with Afghanistan.  The participating 
countries were Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.  China 
and Pakistan representatives were unable to attend but promised to 
make every effort to attend these meetings in the future.  This 
forum provided the proper atmosphere to rekindle discussions 
previously abandoned regarding border issues such as economic 
 
KABUL 00000881  003.2 OF 004 
 
 
development and trading issues that promise to shape better 
relationships.  The BMI Working Group (chaired by the Ministry of 
Finance) intends to coordinate further bilateral discussions between 
the GoA and its neighbors to discuss a broader scope of topics 
including the shared responsibility of neighboring countries to 
improve border security (NOTE:  No USG personnel will be involved in 
facilitating or otherwise contacting Government of Iran officials 
for this purpose.  END NOTE). 
¶9.  (SBU)  A new ABP strategy drafted and approved by MoI, CSTC-A 
PRD and the GPPO revising programs and procedures from lessons 
learned was addressed in the January EXBS cable.  Subsequently, the 
BMTF Border Police Coordinator has drafted follow-up recommendations 
detailing the following to assist in the ABP's mobile strategy, 
developing infrastructure, equipping and integrating border specific 
technology to consider when implementing this new strategy: 
- Improving mobility and rapid deployment to quickly counter and 
interdict threats. 
- Applying a defense-in-depth approach that makes full use of 
interior checkpoints and enforcement operations calculated to deny 
successful illegal entry and smuggling attempts with special 
emphasis focused to develop both fixed checkpoints and mobile patrol 
operations and exploiting force multipliers with electronics, 
communications and optics 
- Coordination and partnering with other law enforcement agencies 
- Improving border awareness and intelligence 
- Provide specialized border police training to enable Border 
Policemen to safely and effectively perform their responsibilities 
- Threat/Risk Analysis 
- Electronic Monitoring Strategies of Interdiction 
Environmental Compatible Integrated Communications 
- Recruiting and Retention Strategies 
- Success/Failure Measurement Monitoring System 
 
¶10.  (SBU) A small team representing the BMTF and the AED traveled 
to Regional Command-South (RC-South) on two separate occasions 
during this reporting period. While in Kandahar, the BMTF/AED team 
conducted briefings with RC-South border stakeholders outlining 
current and planned infrastructure projects with RC-South ISAF/USACE 
engineers and PRT representatives.  The team and RC-South officers 
reviewed procedures, requirements and benefits of the Afghanistan 
Country Stability Picture (ACSP) program. In addition, the team met 
with the Kandahar Regional Police Advisory Team (RPAT) Commanders to 
review ABP and border related programs and challenges. Additional 
monthly follow-up and work group meetings are planned with RC-South 
engineers to improve infrastructure project coordination efforts. 
 
¶11.      (SBU) The BMTF/AED team also traveled to the Spin Boldak 
region in Kandahar Province on two occasions to conduct site recons 
of the Spin Boldak BCP and its operations at Weesch. Because there 
are no Customs facilities at Weesch where commercial traffic enters 
Afghanistan from Pakistan en route to Spin Boldak, a great loss of 
GoA revenue and cargo is lost. The BMTF team met with local ABP 
Officers, the Spin Boldak Customs Director and ACD-Kandahar 
representatives to discuss current BCP procedures and options for a 
future BCP at Weesch. Results of the recon trips and new BCP options 
were reviewed with the ACD Director General who agreed to follow up 
with land procurement research and a plan of action.  ACD officials 
in Kabul, Kandahar and Spin Boldak remain very enthusiastic about 
the possibility of a new BCP project in Weesch to improve the 
control of commerce and the collection of revenue in this porous 
border region. The BMTF/AED team was supported by ISAF RC-South and 
DoS/INL Civilian Police Mentors during these recon visits.
