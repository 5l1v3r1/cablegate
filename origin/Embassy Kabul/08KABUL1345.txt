SUBJECT: PRT GHAZNI: LOCAL LEADERS FORM CIVIL SOCIETY SHURA THAT 
COULD HELP PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS - INCLUDING NEW GOVERNOR 
 
¶1. (SBU) Ghazni city politics are the most vocal and visible 
politics in the province.  The city's five officially recognized 
"shuras" shape public opinion and influence its expression.  In 
January, a shura encouraged anti-Coalition Forces protests after the 
accidental shooting of ten Afghan police officers.  This spring, the 
shuras discouraged protests over food prices and teacher salaries. 
The shuras often represent Ghazni province to the President's Office 
and to the National Assembly and will be helpful to new Governor 
Mohammad Usman as he begins work in Ghazni.  Ghazni's official 
shuras represent leaders of the Hazara, Pashtun, Tajik and Sikh 
communities. The inter-ethnic "Cultural Association," which includes 
many professionals, is the fifth shura. 
 
A NEW AND UNIFIED CIVIL SOCIETY SHURA 
------------------------------------- 
¶2. (U) These powerful civil society voices became better organized 
and more coherent in late April when their leaders formed a joint 
coordinating body - a civil society shura - composed of five members 
from each shura.  Former Governor Khosti, local businessman and 
developer Khalil Khotak, and Mehshrano Jirga Member Maulana Abdur 
Rahman all had a hand in the new shura's creation.  The shura's main 
concerns echo frequently heard complaints: insufficient development 
assistance, insecurity in the province's rural areas, administrative 
corruption, and a lack of attention to "Islamic principles" in 
government.  The new shura may have the clout and sense of 
responsibility to suggest solutions to these perennial problems. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The creation of the civil society shura suggests a 
maturation of Ghazni's civil society movement.  The shura could help 
Ghazni's new governor, Dr. Mohammad Usman (a Kandahari) to 
understand Ghazni and manage his relationship with local 
communities.  However, its members may exploit their influence to 
receive favorable treatment from the Governor's office.  For 
example, former Governor Khosti cleared bureaucratic hurdles for an 
organizer's real-estate development.  Provincial Council (PC) and 
shura members both deny designs on each other's bureaucratic turf, 
but some tensions are evident.  The PC President told PRToff that 
Governor Usman should listen to the PC first, and handle his 
relations with shuras through the PC, an elected body representing 
all of Ghazni.  His argument has merit: un-elected and representing 
only Ghazni city and its environs, the civil society shura is 
important, but not representative of the whole province. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT: There is value in the concept of a single body of 
manageable size that can speak and act responsibly on behalf of 
local interest groups.  Governor Usman needs to work with the 
Provincial Council as well as the vocal civil society shura, and to 
encourage the two bodies to respect each other's roles.
