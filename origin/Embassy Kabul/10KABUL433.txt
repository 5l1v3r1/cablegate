¶1. (SBU) Summary.  The visibility of the USAID-funded 
Afghanistan Vouchers for Increased Production in Agriculture 
Plus (AVIPA Plus) program is growing in Regional 
Command-South (RC-South), and we are seeing progress in seven 
key districts in Helmand and Kandahar provinces.  AVIPA Plus 
is a key stabilization program to bring agricultural 
development to recently cleared districts in RC-South.  The 
carrot of receiving cash and critical agricultural inputs 
with future benefits to their livelihoods is contributing to 
the shaping operations and stability within RC-South.  Paras 
3-5 contain anecdotal examples of AVIPA Plus accomplishments. 
 End Summary. 
 
AVIPA PLUS IN RC-SOUTH 
---------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) AVIPA Plus operates in seven districts in RC-SOUTH: 
Kandahar province ) Arghandab and Spin Boldak and Helmand 
province ) Nad Ali, Nawa, Garmsir, Nahr-e Saraj, and Lashkar 
Gah.  It is poised to commence operations in two other 
districts within Kandahar: District Eight of Kandahar City 
and Zhari.  AVIPA Plus is implemented by International Relief 
and Development (IRD), an international NGO, and programming 
consists of four components: cash-for-work, training, small 
grants, and vouchers for agricultural inputs. 
 
FIGHTING THE TALIBAN WITH AVIPA IN NAD ALI 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) Following a recent clearing operation to prepare for 
military operations in Marjah, villagers approached the 
District governor to register for cash-for-work programs 
under AVIPA Plus.  A few after registering, the local Taliban 
villagers began to intimidate the villagers and left night 
letters at the homes of elders.  Elders have welcomed 
economic support to their areas, including AVIPA Plus, and 
reported to the U.S. staffed-Nad Ali District Support Team 
(DST) that they went to the Taliban leaders to negotiate with 
them.  In the meeting, the elders questioned the insurgents 
why their village should not receive the same work benefits 
as other villages in the district.  The elders told the 
Taliban leaders that they would not obey their directive and 
instead if they tried to prevent the villagers from taking 
part in the AVIPA Plus program, they would raise a force in 
opposition to the insurgents.  (Note:  Residents of Nad Ali 
are fully aware of the widely publicized upcoming operations 
in Marjah, a community near the district center. End Note) 
 
LAYING DOWN ARMS FOR WAGES IN NAWA, HELMAND 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Since September 2009, AVIPA Plus has provided 
approximately 1900 Afghans with short term cash for work 
opportunities, with plans to employ 4000 in the near future. 
Project locations have focused on secure areas near the 
district center, but as the Community Council and District 
Governor have begun to take greater responsibility for 
assigning projects and holding communities accountable for 
security, there is concerted effort by the DST and 
implementing partners to expand geographical coverage. 
Insurgents have reportedly begun laying down arms, choosing 
to participate in the certainty of cash for work wages rather 
than face the dangers of the upcoming operations.  (Note: The 
population centers of Nad Ali and Nawa are contiguous, with 
senior tribal elders of Nawa having great influence over 
nearby Marjah. End Note) By working closely with the DSTs, 
the AVIPA Plus program is contributing to the shaping 
operations in Nad Ali. 
 
PROGRESS IN ARGHANDAB 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) In the Nagahan area of western Arghandab district, 
villagers have reacted positively to AVIPA Plus program, 
launched by the Provincial Governor in the district in 
November 2009.  Through cash-for-work, approximately 1800 
local villagers have been employed to do orchard management 
projects, such as removing dead fruit and underbrush.  AVIPA 
Plus also brought agriculture experts from the local 
university to teach orchard owners how to properly prune 
their trees that will result in higher, noticeable yields. 
The program works closely with the USAID-funded Afghanistan 
Stability Initiative (ASI) program, which focuses on 
non-agriculture needs, to provide stability projects in the 
valley.  Western Arghandab Valley has been a no-go area due 
to the high level of insecurity; since last September, 
village elders have been repeatedly told that security must

be improved before any assistance would arrive.  In recent 
weeks, U.S. Special Forces moved into Adira village, 
indicating significantly improved security, paving the way 
for continued engagement with GIRoA and for ASI and AVIPA 
Plus to program in the district. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) AVIPA Plus activities are having a positive impact 
throughout key areas of RC-South.  The carrot of receiving 
cash and critical agricultural inputs with future benefits to 
their livelihoods is contributing to the shaping operations 
and stability within RC-South.  We will continue to build on 
these initial steps and expand the program to support 
governance and development efforts in the South.
