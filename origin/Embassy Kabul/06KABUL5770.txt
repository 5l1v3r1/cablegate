SUBJECT: CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION (CWC):  STATUS OF 
AFGHAN DRAFT IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION 
 
REF: STATE 193643 
 
¶1. (SBU) Polmiloff discussed reftel message December 10 with 
Ismail Amerkhil, MFA UN Desk.  Amerkhil said that Afghan 
draft CWC implementing legislation has been developed by a 
GOA interagency commission.  The draft legislation currently 
is at the MOD, which has responsibility for forwarding the 
text to the Cabinet for approval.  Once approved by the 
Cabinet, the draft legislation must be sent to the Parliament 
for review and approval. Amerkhil could not predict when the 
implementing legislation might be promulgated.  He emphasized 
the difficulty of moving the process forward amidst the GOA's 
many other competing legislative priorities, but underlined 
that the MFA will continue its efforts.  Amerkhil mentioned 
that the Finnish Embassy and local European Commission office 
had queried the MFA on the status of the implementing 
legislation.  He further noted that he has provided a copy of 
the GOA's draft legislation to an OPCW representative at an 
October conference in Kyrgyzstan.  Amerkhil said that the MFA 
also is following up on an offer from the OPCW to provide 
further training on national implementation issues. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  Since the formation of the Afghan 
Parliament following national elections one year ago, the 
system for developing and approving national legislation is a 
work in progress.  The constitutional framework is in place, 
and legislation addressing a number of urgent Afghan national 
priorities is under review, but government officials and 
parliamentarians are facing a large backlog of presidential 
decrees and laws.  Agenda priorities for Parliament are very 
difficult to predict.  Parliament is on winter recess until 
January 21.  It therefore is difficult to assess when the 
GOA's draft CWC implementing legislation will be finalized.
