SUBJECT: KABUL POLICE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TRAINING 
 
¶1. (U) Political officer attended a portion of a training 
workshop for 40 Kabul police officers and employees held 
August 12-14 and organized by the Afghan Women Skills 
Development Centre (AWSDC) and supported financially by INL. 
The workshop, held at the Kabul Provincial Police 
Headquarters, was the third training conducted over the past 
12 months by AWSDC with the purpose of training Kabul Police 
employees to respond appropriately to domestic violence cases 
including how to refer victims to an INL funded shelter. 
 
¶2. (U) The first two workshops held in the past year focused 
on training the 44 male and female police officers who form 
the 17 Police Family Response Units in Kabul.  This third 
workshop was open to, and primarily attended by, other Kabul 
police officers and employees who volunteered to receive the 
training. 
 
¶3. (U) Approximately 25 male and 15 female police officers 
and other employees participated in the August 12 workshop, 
which consisted of a presentation on the different forms of 
domestic violence and the effects of domestic violence on 
families and society.  Attendees actively participated 
through group presentations and role play scenarios, with 
many speaking up to highlight the role of increased 
educational and economic opportunities as keys to reducing 
domestic violence.   Participants also linked domestic 
violence to the common issue of Afghan boys, usually ages 
9-15, who run away from home, many of whom end up working in 
Pakistan and Iran as victims of trafficking.  Several 
participants also said that domestic violence is a cause of 
increased rates of drug addiction and children,s 
failure to regularly attend school. 
 
¶4. (U) Poloff talked to several of the participants, 
listening to their opinions of the workshop and of domestic 
violence in Afghanistan.  All praised the workshop as 
beneficial to their work and requested that more be held. 
Several women in reference to men,s treatment of women said 
that while the words used when talking about addressing 
violence towards women sound good, in reality there remains 
much progress to be made in changing social attitudes. In 
general, the workshop was well-run and well-received and 
appears to have the strong support of Kabul Provincial Police 
high-level authorities, several of whom were in attendance.
