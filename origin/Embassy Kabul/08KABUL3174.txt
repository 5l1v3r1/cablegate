SUBJECT: NOT AFRAID: AFGHAN WOMEN LEADERS, ROLE MODELS, AND 
THE NEXT GENERATION 
 
¶1. (U)  An impressive sampling of Afghan women leaders 
attended a December 4 human rights and gender violence 
seminar, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Interior and 
the US Embassy. International media coverage focused on 
quotes about increasing threats to women in public life.  The 
participants, however, offered a more sophisticated analysis 
of the situation of women in Afghanistan today, stressing the 
historical, social, and economic context. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Afghan National Army General Khatool, who leads 
the Army's training department, noted that deteriorating 
public security and the economic downturn are now joining 
persistent female illiteracy and "unacceptable" traditions as 
drivers of violence against women.  "Women pay the price of 
crimes against men," she said, when families use forced 
marriages to pay off blood and honor debts that result from 
the lawless conflicts of the insurgency. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Azra Jafari, the recently-appointed mayor of the 
provincial capital of Dai Kundi and the country's first woman 
to hold such a post, said development was her first priority. 
 Implementing the long-delayed municipal plan for public 
services, Jafari argued, was the fastest and best way to 
change the situation of women.  Afghan National Police 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Colonel Maria Sediqqa Rasekh cited Islamic 
teachings that protect women's rights, and noted that, unlike 
the "corruption of the Taliban," this government has made 
progress in setting up institutions such as specialized 
police units to address family violence. As for the burqa and 
similar traditions, Sediqqa Rasekh told reporters: "The 
uniform itself is a sign of courage for women.  It shows we 
are not afraid."

ROLE MODELS AND THE FUTURE 
-------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  These prominent women, and others like them, are 
both a force for change now and role models for the next 
generation.  On December 3, more than 20 Afghan women leaders 
and their daughters and nieces attended a "Mother-Daughter 
Career Day" hosted by the Embassy.  In a lively open-mike 
format, Afghan and American women traded stories of 
experiences in overcoming discrimination, building careers, 
and balancing work and family.  Judge Uzra Zoi said, "The 
Taliban told me I couldn't be a judge because I am a woman. 
Look, here, now I am a judge. And a judge in the 
counternarcotics court, which is very difficult." An young 
NGO leader spoke up: "I am 19 years old," she said.  "I run 
my organization because I am ready to help other women."  A 
daughter, aged 12, took the floor to announce that she 
admired her mother's career in politics.  As for herself, and 
the future, "I will run for president."
