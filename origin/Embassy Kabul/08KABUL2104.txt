Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On August 6, Prsident Karzai told Codel Reid that 
Pakistan hs permitted terrorist sanctuaries in its teritory 
and the ISI has a clear role in supportng terrorists 
entering Afghanistan to kill Ameican troops and Afghan 
people.  He urged the USG to increase pressure on Pakistan to 
act against the sanctuaries.  Karzai conceded corruption 
persists in Afghanistan.  Karzai anticipted a &nasty8 
campaign, but a fair vote, whichhe expected to take place in 
August or September 2009.

Introduction 
------------ 
 
¶2. (U) Codel Reid, comprised of Senator Majority Leader Reid 
and Senators Bingaman, Isakson, Menendez and Bill Nelson, 
called on President Karzai at the Palace.  Ambassador Wood 
accompanied.  Polcouns took notes. 
 
¶3. (U) Reid complimented Karzai for the progress achieved in 
Afghanistan under his leadership.  Reid told Karzai that the 
Codel was impressed during its visit earlier in the day to a 
school constructed with USAID funds.  The children were 
inspired to learn, which made the Senators even more 
interested in helping Afghanistan.

Pakistan

¶4. (SBU) Bingaman asked what the United States and 
Afghanistan could do to prevent the infiltration of 
insurgents from Pakistan.  Karzai said Pakistan was providing 
sanctuaries for terrorists that pose a danger to Afghanistan 
and potentially to the world and that Pakistan must act 
against those sanctuaries.  He contended that these 
terrorists could not operate in the region without the 
support or benign neglect of the ISI.  He urged the USG to 
increase its pressure on Pakistan. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Nelson asked about direct action against the Quetta 
Shura.  Karzai asserted that he would support such action, 
and he cited his past failed efforts to convince President 
Musharraf to act on Afghan intelligence on names and 
locations of Taliban leaders in Quetta. 
 
------------- 
Corruption 
------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Menendez asked what Karzai was doing to strengthen 
governance and combat corruption.  Karzai lamented the poor 
state of the country,s institutional development.  Officials 
at all levels could intervene in people,s lives ) seeking 
bribes, even committing violent crimes against individuals 
with impunity.  He welcomed the work that the USG was doing 
to help build the capacity of Afghan officials and urged more. 
 
----------- 
Elections 
----------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Isakson asked Karzai for his assessment of the 
upcoming election.  Karzai predicted a &nasty8 campaign ) 
worse than in the United States.  He expected the election to 
take place in August or September 2009.  Planning is already 
under way for registration and security.  He anticipated a 
fair election, contending that the government did not have 
the ability to intervene.  He welcomed the financial and 
technical help from the United States and other donors and 
expected Afghanistan would need more. 
 
The Codel did not clear this message.
