REJECT AID IN KANDAHAR 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Local NGOs in Kandahar report 
increased intimidation by anti-coalition forces. This, 
compounded by continuing corruption, creates an 
extremely difficult environment for aid organizations. 
Villagers are asking NGOs not to return. Corrupt 
officials are impeding their work in other areas. In a 
meeting with the Ambassador on November 15 in 
Kandahar, NGOs asked for international help to push 
back against this intimidation and recommended the 
increased use of locally based NGOs. END SUMMARY.

Intimidation Spreads 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Leaders of local NGOs told the Ambassador 
that villages throughout Kandahar are declining aid 
for fear of retaliation by anti-coalition militia 
forces. This is not a new problem, but they report the 
areas affected appear to be growing significantly. One 
NGO representative alleged that only fifteen minutes 
outside of Kandahar City, Afghans were being 
threatened with violence if they cooperated with aid 
organizations. This worsening of the security 
situation could hinder the GOA and the international 
community in carrying out reconstruction projects in 
rural areas, thus posing a greater threat to our 
reconstruction efforts than isolated IED attacks. 
 
--------------------- 
Continuing Corruption 
--------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Corruption and poor governance are also 
serious problem in Kandahar. Both Kandahar's governor 
and local NGOs complained about the lack of effective 
governance in Kandahar province, describing pervasive 
problems with district officials. For example, when 
one NGO asked for permission to dig an irrigation 
system, the district leader responded in a blatantly 
tribalist manner, saying they could only work in an 
area surrounding his tribe. The Governor himself 
admitted that an ineffective district police chief, 
whom he dismissed, did not have a basic understanding 
of his duties. NGOs reported an increasing gap between 
the government and the people and they requested that 
the international community speak out with one voice 
against government appointment of corrupt officials.

¶4. (SBU) The deteriorating operational security 
environment for NGOs in Kandahar poses another 
impediment to reconstruction. The intimidation of aid 
recipients needs to be addressed through both 
increased security measures and greater use of NGOs 
that utilize locally based staff. Embassy is exploring 
a pilot project along these lines in Kandahar. 
Security is also getting further study.
