iii.  All fills should be accomplished using the principle of closes 
assignment first.  Because of the nature of Afghan society, it is cou 
to move personnel long distances away from their homes and families t 
police manning requirements.  Coupled with a lack of electronic banki 
would allow individual police to send their pay home to families, mov 
personnel without regard to place of origin would only result in poor 
and an increase in severance from the police forces.   Therefore, our 
emphasize volunteering over forced moves. 
 
iv.  This Course of Action and any other will be affected by pay and 
over time and require those efforts to take into account the re-balan 
 
v.  All personnel should move to new assignments with assigned weapon 
personal equipment.  This will provide for immediate capability upon 
new duty assignment.  The gaining police unit will record and documen 
weapons and equipment of all arriving personnel. 
 
vi.  The MOI should identify which highway security missions previous 
performed by the AHP should be maintained.  These missions should be 
by historical analysis, such as reviews of arrest records and reports 
commercial and private vehicles by Anti-Coalition Militias.  Highway 
assessed as having a high risk of attack should retain security prote 
performed by the Afghan Uniformed Police, Afghan Stand-By Police or A 
Border Police, whichever is more appropriate. 
 
vii.  All Afghan Highway Police personnel, except for a small caretak 
senior leaders, must volunteer for new positions or elect to resign f 
Afghan National Police altogether. 
viii.  To minimize the number of AHP personnel to reassign, and to pr 
mission from growing, the MOI will be pressed to halt all AHP recruit 
 
ix.  Adjust all Afghan National Police fielding and logistics support 
support this Course of Action. 
 
x.  Develop public information programs to highlight the major fieldi 
initiatives, inauguration of Regional Commands and significant person 
assignment actions.  Start by conducting an inaugural  ceremony on Ma 
2006, at the Kandahar Police Regional Training Center that covers act 
Regional Command South, and includes a major display of vehicles, wea 
uniforms and equipment that will be fielded immediately to the Afghan 
Police in Kandahar Province. 
 
xi.  Proper Demographic Representation is the basic model used to f 
recruiting policies for this effort.  It basic tenets are listed belo 
 
¶1.  Proper Demographic Representation was emphasized as a method of 
conducting business by President Karzai and applies to all types of p 
placing special emphasis on operational effectiveness achieved by 
establishing a presence and understanding with the community in which 
the police operate. 
 
¶2.  Proper Demographic Representation consists of three major 
components:  a) maintaining ethnic balance in all police units, promo 
and assignments - for the Afghan Uniform Police this must be done at 
district level and must be a goal of the current plan, and for Afghan 
fghan 
Police and Afghan Stand-By Police this must be done at least at the 
regional level when feasible; b) fill police ranks, especially the lo 
Afghan Uniformed Police, first through local recruiting, which make i 
easier and should maintain proper local ethnic mix if executed fairly 
ensure that properly equipped police maintain a presence in the areas 
are responsible for and seek to achieve understanding and trust with 
local population. 
 
¶3.  Dont over-recruit in any one particular area to fill other areas 
one particular ethnic group, already a often-stated concern. 
 
¶4.  Recruiting should use threat study and population analysis report 
accepted by the GOA and the international community.

e.  Fill Requirements, Priorities, and Strategies.  Because each part 
National Police has different requirements a standard strategy or fil 
used.  This is because in the case of the Afghan Uniform Police, the 
inadequately documents security requirements in RC-South.  Additional 
Tashkil does not determine which police structures should be filled f 
constrained environment.  Therefore the following fill strategies wil 
 
      i.  Fill Strategies by Type of Police. 
 
¶1.  Afghan Uniform Police (AUP).  Fill according to the provinces wit 
the highest threat and lowest ratio of police to the general populati 
only the four highest threat provinces and fill to a level that will 
these provinces online with ratios in provinces that have a low threa 
 
      a.  Kandahar:  current need is approximately 800 Policemen. 
 
      b.  Helmand:  current need is approximately 600 Policemen. 
 
      c.  Uruzgan:  current need is approximately 150 Policemen. 
 
      d.  Paktika:  current need is approximately 300 Policemen. 
 
¶2.  Afghan Stand-By Police (ASP).  Because Afghan Stand-By Police are 
a regional asset, they should be filled by region starting with the P 
with the overall highest threat and lowest Police to population ratio 
Using that thought process listed below are the actions and fill prio 
for the Afghan Stand-By Police. 
 
      a.  RC-South. 
 
i.  Move one Afghan Stand-By Police Battalion from RC- 
North (5th Bn in Konduz) permanently to RC-South and 
man to 100 percent:  current need is approximately 140 
policemen. 
 
ii.  Fill existing RC South Afghan Stand-By Police 
Battalion to 100 percent (2d Bn in Kandahar):  current need 
is approximately 221 policemen.. 
 
b.  Fill remaining Afghan Stand-By Police Battalions to 
100 percent 
 
i.  ASP Bn in RC Central (6th Bn):  current need is 
approximately 176 policemen 
 
ii.  ASP Bn in RC East (1st Bn):  current need is 
approximately 372 policemen. 
 
iii.  ASP Bn in RC West:  current need is approximately 
100 policemen. 
 
iv.  ASP Bn in RC Central (7th Bn):  current need is 
approximately 378 Policemen. 
 
v.  ASP Bn in RC Central (8th Bn):  current need is 
approximately 376 policemen. 
 
vi.  ASP Bn in RC North (4th Bn in MeS):  current need is 
approximately 343 policemen. 
 
¶3.  Afghan Border Police (ABP).  Fill in accordance with the new Tash 
 
KABUL 00002149  004.4 OF 005 
 
 
which does adequately describe Border Police requirements. 
 
a.  RC South4th and 5th ABP Bdes:  Current shortfall is 
approximately 1056 policemen. 
 
b.  RC East2nd and 3rd ABP Bdes:  Current shortfall is 
approximately 848 policemen. 
 
c.  RC West6th ABP Bde:  Current shortfall is approximately 
672 policemen. 
 
d.  RC Central1st ABP Bde:  Current shortfall is approximately 
583 policemen. 
 
e.  RC North7th and 8th Bdes:  Current shortfall is 
approximately 923 policemen. 
 
      ii.  Fill (Man, Equip, Train) Priorities from 1 to n. 
 
      ¶1.  AUP in Kandahar. 
 
      ¶2.  AUP in Helmand. 
 
      ¶3.  5th ASP Battalion with move to RC-South.

      ¶10.  1st ASP Battalion in RC-East. 
 
      ¶11.  6th ABP Brigade in RC-West.

      ¶14.  7th ASP Battalion in RC-Central. 
 
      ¶15.  8th ASP Battalion in RC-Central. 
 
      ¶16.  7th and 8th ABP Brigades in RC-North. 
 
¶17. 4th ASP Battalion in RC-North. 
 
iii.  Therefore, the total personnel requirement for all type of poli 
balanced is approximately 8,038. 
 
f.  Sourcing Strategies.  After identifying the requirements, the sou 
requirements will be defined.  There are four major potential sources 
accomplish the re-balancing tasks.  All of these are limited by the i 
willingness to serve outside a certain radius of his ancestral homela 
sources we must first seek volunteers from the existing forces that w 
to other Police Forces with greater need and attempt to keep the volu 
home as possible. 
 
i.  Afghan Highway Police Manpower.  The first manning pool to explor 
Afghan Highway Police.  They are currently located in 298 fixed check 
locations along the Ring Road and along spur roads that lead to the 1 
border crossing points.  It currently has approximately 5,945 personn 
operating forces that could be available for placement in the Uniform 
and Stand-By Police.  Given that not all of these personnel will elec 
policeman and move to a new job and location, the number available wi 
something less than 5,945.  However, it must be clear to AHP personne 
must move to a new police function or lose their job. 
 
ii.  Afghan Security Force (ASF) Recruiting.  There are approximately 
personnel along the Afghan-Pakistan Border that may still want to vol 
 
KABUL 00002149  005.4 OF 005 
 
 
some type of national service.  Some of these 800 will want to join t 
remainder may want to joint the ANPpresumably the Border Police firs 
Therefore, the Afghans must capitalize on the existing programs to de 
the ASF into our high priority requirements in RC-South, most likely 
Afghan Border Police Brigades. 
 
iii.  Move Personnel from Over-Manned  to Under-Manned Areas.  This s 
is the least desirable because it is least likely to be effective.  M 
policemen will not volunteer to move long distances away from their c 
homes.  However, the Afghan Uniformed Police is over-manned, primaril 
North, and the Afghans could ask for volunteers to relocate to RC-Sou 
Uniformed Police are under-manned, according to the threat and popula 
studies. 
 
iv.  Local Hire and Send to RTC for Training.  The most likely source 
manpower after re-assigning AHP personnel is a policy of local hire. 
receive something near 5,900 personnel from re-balancing the Afghan H 
Police, then we will need to local hire approximately 2,100 new Polic 
in several locationsprimarily in RC-South.  However, the Afghans mus 
prepared to local hire up to the entire requirement of 8,038 personne 
ordered to ensure re-balancing does occur. 
 
g.  Assisted Implementation Phasing.  Given that re-balancing will be 
phasing our efforts will most likely assist in more efficient executi 
start in the areas of greatest needthat have the greatest security i 
i 
South must be the focus of initial re-balancing efforts.  The other R 
Police Operating Forces will be successively re-balanced on a similar 
In all of this the Afghan MoI will be assisted by those International 
organizations and personnel with Police expertise.  Additionally, the 
Commands will be assisted by Regional Police Advisory Teams (RPATs), 
with the daily planning and execution of re-balancing tasks in the re
