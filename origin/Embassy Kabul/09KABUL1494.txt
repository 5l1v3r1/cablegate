SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTRY REQUESTS INTERVENTION ON ARRESTED 
AFGHAN CONSULAR OFFICIAL 
 
1.(SBU) MFA Americas Director General Khaled Zekriya raised 
to Polcouns on June 10 the case of Mohammad Fakhirad, an 
official at Afghanistan's Consulate in New York.  Queens' 
police officers arrested Fakhirad on February 13 on charges 
of alleged domestic violence.  Zekriya reported that Fakhirad 
is in New York and awaiting trial.  Authorities are holding 
his passport.  Fakhirad remains an employee of the Foreign 
Ministry, but the Ministry has terminated his assignment and 
he is now in the United States on the equivalent of 
leave-without-pay status.  Fakhirad's wife reportedly remains 
in the United States. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Zekriya stated that Fakhirad is facing financial 
difficulties.  The Foreign Ministry asked for the Department 
of State to ask the appropriate prosecuting authorities to 
accelerate their preparations to bring the case to trial. 
Alternatively, the Foreign Ministry requested the United 
States' concurrence in permitting Fakhirad to return to 
Afghanistan to stand trail.  Zekriya asserted that Afghan 
authorities would take the case to trial here. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We seek Department guidance on the Foreign 
Ministry's request.
