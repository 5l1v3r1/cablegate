SUBJECT: COLOMBIANS DISCUSS ENGAGEMENT WITH QAL-E-NOW PRT 
 
¶1. (SBU) A senior Colombian military delegation led by Army Chief of 
Operations, Major General Matamoros, conducted a third fact-finding 
mission on Aug 12 and 13 to the Spanish-led PRT at Qal-e-Now in 
Badghis province.  Five other senior Columbian military officials 
also attended, including Brigadier General Zapata Uribe, Army Chief 
of Training and Doctrine, as well as Colombian Police Brigadier 
General Caro Melendez, Chief of Counter Narcotics. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Presentations during the visit focused on Spanish efforts 
and needs, and the link between narco-trafficking and the insurgency 
in Northern Badghis.  The Spanish made presentations regarding the 
security situation in the province as well as their operational 
efforts and logistical capacities.  Badghis Governor, Mohammad 
Ashraf Nasery, who has a counter-narcotics background and has 
visited Colombia, emphasized the problems caused by poppy 
cultivation and the link between narco-trafficking and the 
insurgency.  Spanish PRT Commander, Col. Rolan, underlined the 
governor's comments, calling narco-trafficking the insurgency's 
"motor" in the province's northern districts.  He also offered his 
assessment as to what military forces would be most useful in the 
province:  doctors to perform medical civil affairs Programs 
(MEDCAPs); maneuver forces; combat engineers; tactical combat air 
patrol (TACP); and special forces. 
 
¶3. (SBU) General Matamoros stated that Colombia is interested in 
assisting the international mission in Afghanistan, but emphasized 
this visit was a fact-finding mission and the specific nature of any 
assistance must still be evaluated.  He offered de-mining activities 
as a possible Colombian engagement.  The General also lowered 
expectations, saying there may be some political resistance to 
providing military assistance to Afghanistan as Colombia still faces 
an active insurgency.
