SUBJECT: PRT/SHARANA: PAKTIKA GOVERNOR ON SPRING OFFENSIVE 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Paktika's Governor Khpalwak has launched 
his own political spring offensive designed to preempt a 
widely expected Taliban offensive in southeastern 
Afghanistan.  Starting on March 18, the Governor has been in 
near constant motion around the province.  The Governor's 
agenda included hosting an Islamic New Year's party for 
thousands in Sharana, speaking at several government 
construction groundbreaking ceremonies, inspecting Taliban 
prisoners and captured equipment, and speaking directly to 
district tribal Shuras as well as to the national and 
international press.  Strongly bolstered by new construction 
projects from PRT Sharana, Governor Khpalwak has taken to the 
road and to the airwaves to get his and the GOA's message out 
to the people prior to any major Taliban activity.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
WHEN THE ROCKS WARM UP THE TALIBAN COME OUT 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The Soviet forces in Afghanistan had a saying, 
"when the rocks warm up the Mujahideen come out".  Governor 
Mohammad Akram Khpalwak, aware that this now applies to the 
Taliban, intends to not just counter but preempt any Taliban 
and other insurgent spring campaign with one of his own.  In 
recent days the Governor has conducted a whirlwind of public 
meetings, press events, and groundbreaking ceremonies 
highlighting the positive, active, and now very public role 
of the Afghan Provincial Government. 
 
TIMING IS EVERYTHING 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Governor Khpalwak began his spring political 
offensive on March 18 by laying the corner stone for 
Sharana's first AM radio station.  On March 21, he presided 
alongside the Provincial Council Chief Nawab Waziri at the 
first Islamic New Year celebration in Paktika since the 
Taliban banned the holiday in 1996.  Thousands of residents 
attended this popular event in Sharana's city park despite 
Taliban threats that had prevented the event in years past. 
Khpalwak also spoke to large audiences at an opening of the 
school year event on March 22.  On March 23, he presided over 
the groundbreaking ceremony for Sar Hawza district's 
government and police center as well as the district's first 
girls school.  Responding to an unsuccessful Taliban attack 
on an Afghan National Army and coalition base in Gayan 
district, the Governor along with two members of the 
Provincial Council traveled to the district on March 25 where 
they spoke with and displayed captured weapons and personnel 
for the local tribal Shura and national press.  Finally, on 
March 26, the Governor spoke at the groundbreaking for a new 
school and district center in Mata Khan district. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Governor Khpalwak has recently embraced 
the Provincial Council and is rarely seen in public without 
the Council's Chairman, Dr. Nawab Waziri.  His strong ties to 
the Council, along with his many recent public addresses 
afforded by the groundbreaking ceremonies of some eleven PRT 
building projects, have helped to strengthen the Governor's 
influence with the people.  His publicity offensive is 
continuing with additional school openings and two large 
tribal shuras scheduled in April.  It is too early to tell 
what effect the expected Taliban offensive will have in 
Paktika.  The Taliban attack in Gayan on 24 March was a 
stunning Taliban military and publicity failure.  Governor 
Khpalwak's recent actions have now clearly put the Taliban on 
notice that they are not the only ones vying for power and 
influence in Paktika province.  END COMMENT
