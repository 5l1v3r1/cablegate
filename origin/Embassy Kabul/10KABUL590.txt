¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Operations in Nad Ali District continued on 
February 16, as ISAF continued to find high numbers of improvised 
explosive devices (IEDs) in the operational area.  Governor Mangal 
attended a security shura today to look at Nad Ali security, and he 
traveled to Camp Bastion to visit three civilian casualties, injured 
by the Taliban.  At the request of the Director of the Independent 
Directorate of Local Governance (IDLG), Governor Mangal also agreed 
to reschedule the launch of the Nad Ali Stabilization Plan, 
originally set for February 18.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  As operations in Nad Ali district proceed, ISAF forces 
continued to encounter large numbers of improvised explosive devices 
(IEDs) and foreign fighters, especially in northern Marjah.  The 
provincial and district governments remain heavily engaged in 
preparations to move forward with development and governance efforts 
once Operation Moshtarak is closed.  This is a situational update 
for the happenings in Nad Ali district for February 16, 2010. 
 
POLITICAL UPDATE 
---------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Helmand Governor Mangal hosted a security shura attended by 
Minister of Interior Atmar, Minister of Defense Wardak, and RC-S 
Commander MG Carter (UK) in Lashkar Gah to examine the current 
security situation of Nad Ali and to look ahead to future security 
measures.  Although no major decisions were made, reports indicate 
that the shura was well received. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Mangal, along with Nad Ali Deputy District Governor 
(covering Marjah) Haji Zahir and a number of Afghan press, traveled 
to the medical ward at Camp Bastion to visit three civilian 
casualties injured by Taliban forces in northern Marjah. 
 
MEDIA UPDATE 
------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) In international reporting, questions are being raised 
about the civilian casualty incident on Sunday.  Although NATO 
forces claimed responsibility for a rocket attack that killed 12 
civilians, American officers Monday were quoted anonymously in the 
New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and McClatchy as maintaining 
that the rocket had hit the compound it was intended to hit, and 
suggested the Taliban may have been using human shields. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The international media was also dominated by reports of 
the capture in Pakistan of the Afghan Taliban's top military 
commander, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.  However, as the operations 
progress, questions from journalists are also turning to the next 
phases of Operation Moshtarak: governance capacity building and 
development.  In an interview with CNN, PRT USAID Team Lead stated, 
"Even influential elders who we honestly didn't think would be 
supportive are aligning themselves with us.  They see the work 
everyone has done in other areas of Helmand and are looking to 
seeing those benefits too." 
 
DEVELOPMENT 
----------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Nad Ali Stabilization Plan launch, which was scheduled 
for February 18, has been rescheduled for a later date since 
Minister Popal, Minister for the Independent Directorate for Local 
Governance, cannot attend on the original date.  Governor Mangal has 
requested that  the launch be moved to next week, date to be 
determined. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Reports from Nad Ali indicate that many culverts and roads 
have been badly damaged due to IEDs, and the PRT is looking for ways 
to assess the damage and send repair teams to fix the damages. 
 
IDP UPDATE 
---------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) As of February 16, the Helmand Department of Refugees and 
Repatriation reports that a total of 1354 families have registered 
in Lashkar Gah, with 129 registered today.  Of this total, 628 
families have asked for humanitarian assistance, such as ration 
cards and supplies.
