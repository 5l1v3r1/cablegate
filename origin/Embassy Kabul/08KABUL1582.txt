¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Recent suicide attacks and insurgent 
incursions have failed to dissuade Nangarhar residents from 
the belief that their province is secure.  Residents 
routinely cite economic concerns as the major problem before 
security concerns.  Nangarharis are concerned about recent 
events in Pakistan, but Nangarhar security forces and their 
Coalition partners have denied insurgents significant 
footholds in the province.  Reconstruction continues apace, 
with major road and irrigation projects the most visible 
signs of progress.  Nangarhar is poised for rapid economic 
growth if sufficient electricity and integrated 
transportation become a reality.  Governance remains the most 
problematic component of the three-fold assistance effort. 
 
Security: Nangarharis Proud of Their Province's Stability 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
¶2. (SBU) Nangarhar remains the most stable and prosperous 
province along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.  Insurgent 
attacks against Afghan border outposts and district centers 
since the beginning of the year have almost doubled compared 
to the same period last year, but still remain at relatively 
low levels.  The attacks are normally superficial, and 
insurgents are unable to stand toe-to-toe with Nangarhar 
security forces.  Despite three recent suicide attacks (one 
against the Khogyani district governor in April and two 
against Coalition convoys), daily life in the province 
remains nearly unaffected.  Local residents still pride 
themselves on the province's relative stability even as they 
harbor apprehensions about possible future suicide attacks. 
Recent events in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal 
Area (FATA) adjacent to Nangarhar, including the 
establishment of multiple insurgent outposts and the growing 
influence of Mangal Bagh, concern provincial officials and 
residents alike.  Insurgent infiltration has thus far focused 
on the southeast quadrant of the province (in the Shinwari 
tribal area adjacent to the Khyber Agency) and the northeast 
corner (adjacent to the Mohmand Agency).  To date, Afghan and 
Coalition forces have successfully reacted to these evolving 
threats and denied the insurgents a significant foothold in 
the province. 
 
Development: Lots of Roads 
-------------------------- 
¶3. (U) Reconstruction activities continue apace.  Residents 
consistently say life is better in Nangarhar now than three 
years ago, although rural reconstruction is lagging along the 
central transportation/population corridor.  Major road 
construction is the most visible sign of progress.  A 
Pakistani-funded project to widen the Torkham-Jalalabad 
Highway to four lanes is nearing completion, as is a European 
Commission-funded city bypass road.  Four PRT-funded hardtop 
roads leading from the highway to major district centers are 
entering their final construction phases.  The PRT recently 
broke ground on a project to replace siphons along the 
Duranta Canal, Nangarhar's agricultural lifeblood.  In the 
provincial capital Jalalabad, the installation of traffic 
lights at major intersections is injecting a sense of order 
to the increasingly congested traffic. 
 
¶4. (U) Local residents often cite food prices and 
unemployment as more pressing threats than insurgents.  The 
lack of electricity remains the greatest hindrance to 
economic development.  The provincial government recently 
installed approximately one megawatt of diesel generation 
capacity in Jalalabad, but it is heavily subsidized for 
residential use and has not led to economic growth. 
Nangarhar is now at the point where reliable and affordable 
electricity and an integrated transportation system -- 
including additional roads in the province's south, a rail 
link to Pakistan, and a regional airport -- will lead to 
rapid economic expansion. 
 
Governance: Lags Behind Security and Development 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
¶5. (SBU) The Nangarhar provincial government functions fairly 
well, but the effort to improve provincial and district-level 
governance still lags behind the security and development 
efforts.  Many jobs are unfilled or occupied by unqualified 
individuals.  Governor Sherzai continues to exercise strong

leadership and to support the Coalition, but fails to tackle 
serious administrative shortcomings.  In particular, he still 
has not installed key Kabul-appointed officials, such as a 
provincial Chief Executive, and has refused to recognize a 
Presidential Directive ordering a halt to the collection of 
"reconstruction taxes" at the border.  The Provincial Council 
is playing an increasingly active and effective role as a 
mediator between the government and the people.  Provincial 
officials remain committed to combating poppy, but worry that 
a tangible "reward" for last year's effort has failed to 
materialize.
