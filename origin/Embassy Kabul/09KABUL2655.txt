¶2. (SBU)  The MFA has focused on soliciting 
contributions from Pakistani, Indian, Sri Lankan, 
Butanese, and Bangladesh scholars, but will also welcome 
any other international contributors.  The focus of the 
conference will be on the conceptual foundations of 
non-violent movements that have manifested in  all of the 
region's religions, including Islam, Buddhism 
and Hinduism.  In addition to a historical look at the role 
non-violent movements have played in South Asia, the 
conference will also invite discussion on the relevance of 
non-violent struggle in contemporary South Asia. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  While the conference has a predominately 
regional focus, the conference organizer told us  that 
the MFA would welcome contributions from the United States. 
In particular, he suggested a presentation on Martin Luther 
King, whose work drew inspiration from movements that were 
started in South Asia. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The conference follows two successful national 
conference hosted by the MFA, but represents the first time 
the MFA  has sought international participation in a conference. 
Proposals  for papers are due by September 15, 2009, and the 
conference will  take place on October 4, 2009 in Kabul.The MFA 
will pay for all travel and accommodations. The expected attendance 
at the conference is between 150-200 Any regional MFAs who would like
