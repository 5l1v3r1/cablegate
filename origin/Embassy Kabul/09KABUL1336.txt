AFGHAN OFFICIALS NERVOUS ABOUT RIPARIAN RIGHTS 
 
¶1. (SBU) At the Islamabad Regional Economic Cooperation Conference 
on Afghanistan (RECCA), Afghan Foreign Ministry officials repeated a 
request to USDEL for assistance on negotiating riparian rights, 
particularly with Iran.  This follows on a request made earlier this 
year that led to a request for an AID-funded advisor to be placed in 
the Foreign Ministry.  We believe that water rights negotiations 
will play a major role in economic development in Afghanistan.  The 
Foreign Ministry's request for further assistance underscores Afghan 
sensitivities on this issue. 
 
BACKGROUND ON AFGHAN-IRAN WATER RIGHTS ISSUE 
 
¶2. (SBU) In January 2009, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Director 
General for Economic Affairs, Enatullah Nabil, asked Deputy Econ 
Counselor to relay an official request to Washington for assistance 
in preparing for riparian rights talks with Afghanistan's neighbors, 
particularly Iran.  Nabil said that discussions under the Central 
Asian Regional Economic Cooperation Conference (CAREC) in Baku last 
November raised the profile on water issues, with specific focus on 
Tajik and Afghan responsibilities as source countries and Uzbekistan 
and Turkmenistan as consumers. 
 
¶3. (SBU) But Nabil emphasized riparian rights discussions with Iran 
are the most problematic.  He said that shifts in the Harirud river 
basin are depleting the water resources for Afghan use to the 
benefit of Iran.  He added that Iran is particularly displeased with 
construction of the Salma Dam, and said "Iran tries to make the 
workers' lives difficult" to impede progress on the project.  Nabil 
believes that Iranian support for insurgent elements is due in part 
to the water issue, as instability helps prolong the status quo, 
which currently benefits Iran.  He stressed the need for MFA to 
obtain negotiating expertise on these issues from the United States 
immediately.  Afghan anxiety over this issue was the major reason 
Afghanistan wanted water off the agenda of the recent RECCA. 
 
ACTIONS TO DATE AND RECOMMENDED 
 
¶4. (SBU) As a result of these discussions, AID contracted with a 
lawyer well-versed in water rights topics.  The Foreign Ministry is 
presently reviewing the resume of this top-ranked candidate selected 
by AID.  If they approve, AID will mobilize the advisor as soon as 
possible.  In the meantime, we may wish to consider creating 
opportunities for Foreign Ministry officials to meet with Department 
experts to prepare for what will likely be thorny negotiations on 
water rights.
