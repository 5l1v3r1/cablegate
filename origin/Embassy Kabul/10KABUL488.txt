SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) On January 23, 2010, the Deputy Minister of Revenues and 
Customs, Mr. Gul Sabit, unofficially reported that annual revenues 
for Afghan fiscal year 2010 are likely to be in excess of the 54.5 
billion Afghanis (USD 1.09 billion) target set by the IMF. 
Estimates from the Ministry of Finance project that revenues are 
likely to top 64 billion Afghanis (USD 1.28 billion), 17 percent 
more than target and 60 percent over 2008-09.  As of January 21, 
2010, Customs revenues reportedly met their annual target (set by 
the IMF) of 20.1 billion Afghanis (USD 402 million) two months 
early.  It is estimated that 5 billion additional Afghanis (USD$100 
million) will be collected through Customs receipts alone by the end 
of the Afghan fiscal year ending on March 21, 2010. This increase 
will help GIRoA to reduce its dependence on operational budget 
support from international donors, and to build its capacity to fund 
and manage its own budget functions. 
 
¶2. (U) Over the past several years, the USG has provided substantial 
revenue collection, budget execution, and fiscal reform assistance 
to the Ministry of Finance and Afghanistan Customs Department, 
contributing to improvements in the country's revenue performance 
and expanding its budget capabilities.  USAID, Treasury, State, and 
the Border Management Task Force (BMTF) have each played a pivotal 
role in this process and continue to work closely with the Ministry 
of Finance and its subordinate offices through tax, non-tax, and 
customs reform programs.  Other donors, including IMF, DFID, the EU, 
and the World Bank, also contribute to revenue collection reform 
efforts.  Moving forward, the USG will continue its fiscal reform 
agenda, as well as support domestic production and services to drive 
exports and broaden the domestic tax base to create a more balanced 
fiscal system.  END SUMMARY.

AFGHANISTAN CUSTOMS REVENUES BEAT EXPECTATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3. (U) Unofficial figures show total Customs revenue collection in 
the first nine months of the current Afghan fiscal year were 20.1 
billion Afghanis (USD$402 million), meeting the annual target two 
months early.  This is the first time Customs revenue has met its 
target prior to the end of the fiscal year.  It is estimated that 5 
billion additional Afghanis (USD$100 million) will be collected 
through Customs receipts by the end of the Afghan fiscal year (March 
21, 2010). 
 
¶4. (U) The impressive revenue increase is a result of better 
governance and various revenue enhancement measures that GIRoA has 
initiated over the last year, including: 
 
--strict performance monitoring of regional directors by the Customs 
Department headquarters in Kabul, 
--shifting/removal of several incompetent and corrupt officials from 
sensitive posts, 
--improving Customs Officers' access to the Ministry of Commerce 
state-owned Fuel Liquid Gas Enterprise (FLGE) installations at 
Heiratan and other points of entry, 
--rolling out the ASYCUDA transit and declaration processing system 
to Custom Houses at Torkham Gate, Jalalabad, Kabul Inland Customs 
Depot, Kabul Airport, Heiratan/Mazar, Islam Quala/Herat, and Shirkan 
Bandar, 
--more vigorous checks by Mobile Verification Teams (MVTs) - the 
Afghan Customs Department's primary enforcement mechanism, 
--improving implementation of post clearance audit, 
--instituting daily revenue collection reporting system, and 
--capacity building of officers engaged in critical work such as 
data analysis and enforcement. 
 
¶5. (U) While all the major Custom Houses showed increased 
collections, the most significant improvements were in Herat, 
Jalalabad, and Mazar.  This was a result of close monitoring of 
performance and other administrative and revenue enhancement 
measures taken during the year. In addition, the Afghan Customs 
Department Customs Statistics Unit (CSU), assisted by USAID, 
established a systematic Customs data collection and reporting 
system.  The Unit is playing a vital role in ACD control over 
revenue and providing on time trade statistics.

INCREASED REVENUE IMPACT ON AFGHANISTAN'S 
OPERATIONAL BUDGET 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Ministry of Finance's Revenues and Customs Department 
estimates that annual revenues will top 64 billion Afghanis 
(USD$1.28 billion) this fiscal year, 17 percent more than targeted 
and 60 percent over the previous year.  Customs Revenues make up 39 
percent of all government revenues.  Deputy Minister Sabit believes 
that if GIRoA can maintain this positive trend, Afghanistan will be 
able to fund its own operational budget from domestic revenues 
within the next three years.  More realistically, the World Bank 
projects 79 percent fiscal sustainability in 2014/15, and the IMF 
projects this by 2022/23. 
 
------------------------------------- 
REVENUE PICTURE INCOMPLETE; EXPANSION 
OF DOMESTIC PRIVATE SECTOR IS KEY 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) On a less positive note, Afghanistan's recent Customs 
revenue jump is linked to an increase in collections as well as 
imports, which is indicative of Afghanistan's weak domestic 
production capability and stagnant exports. In the medium-term, 
Afghanistan's fiscal sustainability must come from stronger domestic 
economic growth and a broader private-sector tax base.  USAID is 
expanding its business development and job creation programs to 
assist Afghanistan to enhance its economic performance.  USAID is 
also supporting the establishment of Medium Tax-payer Offices (MTO) 
in provincial economic centers to enhance tax collection efforts and 
broaden Afghanistan's tax base.  Together these will drive economic 
output, exports, and domestic tax revenues. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The USG is committed to continuing its fiscal reform 
assistance to GIRoA through tax, non-tax, and customs revenue and 
budget management and execution assistance that emulate 
international best practices.  Proposed assistance includes reforms 
in legislation, tariffs, policies and procedures; international 
cooperation on infrastructure and information management; and human 
capacity development, enforcement, and strategic planning.  U.S. 
assistance has created and will continue to create conditions for 
better efficiency in revenue collection, with a direct and positive 
impact on the GIRoA's fiscal resources.
