SUBJECT: PRT HERAT: ANA/ANP NAB RENEGADE JAMIAT COMMANDER 
IN EASTERN HERAT PROVINCE 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please 
do not release to ISAF. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In a combined operation on December 13, ANP and 
ANA elements succeeded in apprehending renegade Jamiat 
Commander Mullah Mustafa, who had been responsible for 
extensive illegal roadblocks, banditry and mayhem in 
Chishti Sharif District (eastern Herat Province).  Mullah 
Mustafa is now being held in custody in Herat city. 
Approximately 150 ANA soldiers from the 207th Corps (Camp 
Victory) provided perimeter support for the ANP who made 
the arrest. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to an NDS official, Governor Anwari 
approved the action and followed the operation closely. 
Before launching the operation, the Governor had requested 
PRT assistance, if possible.  Although the QRF (Quick 
Reaction Force) was reportedly put on alert, no ISAF 
elements or assets appear to have taken part in the 
apprehension.  In a December 17 security meeting hosted by 
UNAMA, participating PRT and FSB/Herat officers did not 
react or comment on the operation. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Local officials noted that, although Mullah 
Mustafa is now in their hands, many of his supporters 
remain at large in Chishti Sharif and elsewhere.  They fear 
there could be vengeance killings and other acts of 
violence before the area is pacified. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  The apprehension of Mullah Mustafa, a 
long-time Ismael Khan (IK) supporter, is evidence of 
Governor Anwaris willingness to take on the provinces 
most prominent warlord - IK - at least on the periphery, in 
order to pacify Herat.  However, as the Governor has stated 
repeatedly, taking on IK himself is another matter 
entirely, and one that must emanate from Kabul, not Herat. 
While the ability of ANA and ANP to conduct a joint 
operation such as this one is a positive development, the 
absence of any ISAF component, despite being asked, is 
indicative of their weak force projection throughout Herat, 
which is increasingly being noted by the local population. 
End comment.
