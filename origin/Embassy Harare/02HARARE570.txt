   MAINSTREAM NEWSPAPERS CONTINUE TO DEVOTE THEIR EDITORIALS, 
   AND MUCH OF THEIR NEWS COVERAGE, TO THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN.

   EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   UNDER THE HEADLINE "MESSAGE THAT MUST REACH ALL 
   VILLAGERS," THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" ON MARCH 5 
   EXPRESSED ITS DISPLEASURE THAT THE COMMONWEALTH FAILED TO 
   SUSPEND THE MUGABE REGIME "FOR ITS BLATANT DISREGARD FOR 
   INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED NORMS OF CIVILIZED GOVERNANCE." 
   EXCERPTS: 
 
   "IT CAN BE PLAUSIBLY ARGUED THAT, EVEN IF IT HAD 
   SUCCEEDED, THE FAILED ATTEMPT TO SUSPEND ZIMBABWE FROM 
   THE COMMONWEALTH WAS UNLIKELY TO ACHIEVE MUCH IN 
   PERSUADING PRESIDENT MUGABE TO STOP THE VIOLENCE HIS 
   PARTY IS USING COUNTRYWIDE TO FORCE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR 
   HIM THIS COMING WEEKEND ANYWAY.  NEVERTHELESS, WE CANNOT 
   PRETEND THAT THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE DO NOT FEEL TERRIBLY 
   LET DOWN BY THE COMMONWEALTH. . .EFFORTS BY THE EUROPEAN 
   UNION AND THE UNITED STATES TO REIN IN OUR ROGUE 
   GOVERNMENT ARE CERTAINLY COMMENDABLE.  BUT THEY CAN ONLY 
   ACHIEVE SO MUCH AND NO MORE.  IT IS NOW LEFT TO 
   ZIMBABWEANS THEMSELVES TO DELIVER THEMSELVES FROM EVIL. 
   AND THEIR ONLY WEAPON IS THEIR VOTE. . . ." 
 
¶3.   UNDER HEADLINE "WE DO NOT NEED A SURROGATE PRESIDENT, 
   "THE BULAWAYO-BASED GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED DAILY "CHRONICLE" 
   DECLARED IN ITS MARCH 5 EDITORIAL THAT ZIMBABWE DOES NOT 
   NEED "WHITE MAN" TO RUN THE COUNTRY.  EXCERPTS: 
 
   ". . .VOTING FOR THE OPPOSITION ON 9 AND 10 MARCH WILL 
   CONDEMN US TO CARRYING (WHITE MAN) ACROSS THE RIVER TO 
   SELL OUR DIAMONDS AND GOLD. . .THEREFORE WE DO NOT NEED

   THEM FOR AN IMPORTANT JOB AS RUNNING THE COUNTRY.  EVEN 
   MORE IMPORTANT, WE DO NOT NEED A SURROGATE PRESIDENT WHO 
   WILL ALWAYS REMIND US, WHEN HE HAS SOLD EVERYTHING 
   INCLUDING HIS SOUL, THAT 'BUT YOU VOTED FOR ME.'" 
 
¶4.   UNDER THE HEADLINE "SAY NO TO WESTERN MANIPULATION," 
   THE 
   BULAWAYO-BASED GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "SUNDAY NEWS" 
   ENCOURAGED ZIMBABWEANS, IN ITS MARCH 3 EDITORIAL TO VOTE 
   FOR PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE IN ORDER TO "REASSERT" 
   ZIMBABWE AS "AFRICA'S LEADING VOICE AGAINST WESTERN 
   MANIPULATION."   EXCERPTS: 
 
   "ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, ZIMBABWEANS WILL VOTE IN AN 
   EPOCH-MAKING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  PAN-AFRICANISTS AND 
   OTHER PROGRESSIVE FORCES WORLDWIDE AGREE THAT THIS 
   ELECTION IS REALLY A TIME TO DECIDE WHETHER ZIMBABWE 
   SHOULD REASSERT ITSELF AS AFRICA'S LEADING VOICE AGAINST 
   WESTERN MANIPULATION OR RETURN TO THE DARK DAYS OF 
   COLONIAL SERVITUDE."
