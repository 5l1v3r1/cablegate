¶2.   "THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION PROTECTION OF PRIVACY 
    BILL. . .CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE MOST 
    DEVIOUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION CRAFTED IN POST- 
    INDEPENDENCE ZIMBABWE, AND ONE WHICH SEEKS TO MAKE 
    CRIMINALS OUT OF OTHERWISE LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS. 
    INTRODUCED OSTENSIBLY TO GIVE THE PUBLIC THE RIGHT TO 
    INFORMATION HELD BY PUBLIC BODIES AND TO PROTECT 
    PERSONAL PRIVACY, THE ALL-EMBRACING BILL. . .WILL HAVE 
    THE NET EFFECT OF CURTAILING AND INTERFERING WILL ALL

    GOVERNMENT POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE VESTED 
    IN THE MANAGEMENT OF A MEDIA ORGANIZATION. . .  SHOULD 
    THE BILL BE PASSED INTO LAW IN ITS PRESENT FORM, THEN 
    CLEARLY A MAJOR SHOWDOWN IS IN THE MAKING BETWEEN THE 
    GOVERNMENT AND THE INDEPENDENT PRESS."
