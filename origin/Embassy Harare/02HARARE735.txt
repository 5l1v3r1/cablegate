¶1.   EDITORIALS IN THE MARCH 21 EDITIONS OF THE 
    INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" AND THE INDEPENDENT 
    WEEKLY "THE FINANCIAL GAZETTE" CALL ON PRESIDENT 
    ROBERT MUGABE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT LED TO 
    ZIMBABWE'S SUSPENSION FROM THE COMMONWEALTH. 
    EXCERPTS: 
 
¶2.   "LIFE CANNOT GO ON AS BEFORE WHEN YOU CHEAT," THE 
    "DAILY NEWS" (03/21) COMMENTS: 
 
    "(SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT) EMMERSON MNANGAGWA'S 
    REACTION TO ZIMBABWE'S SUSPENSION FROM THE 
    COMMONWEALTH IS LOADED WITH THE FALSE BRAVADO WITH 
    WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS REACTED TO CENSURE AND 
    CONDEMNATION FOR ITS ACTIONS OVER THE LAST TWO 
    YEARS.  ON THE SURFACE, IT SMACKS OF DEFIANCE AND 
    ARROGANCE, BUT IT IS REALLY A CRY OF PAIN AND 
    REJECTION. . .  WHAT MNAGNGAGWA AND HIS COLLEAGUES 
    OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT ZIMBABWE HAS BEEN 
    SUSPENDED BECAUSE ZANU PF CHEATED IN THE RECENT 
    PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. . .  IN A SMALL WAY, THE 
    COMMONWEALTH DECISION TO SUSPENDED ZIMBABWE MUST 
    SERVE TO REMIND MUGABE THAT THE REST OF THE WORLD 
    IS WATCHING HIS EVERY MOVE AND WILL POUNCE ON HIM 
    IF HE CONTINUES TO STRAY FROM THE STRAIGHT AND 
    NARROW PATH OF GOOD GOVERNANCE. 
 
    ". . .WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO RESTORE THE DIGNITY 
    OF THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD 
    IS FOR MUGABE. . .TO END THE VIOLENCE AGAINST HIS 
    OWN PEOPLE, TO PUT THE WAR VETERANS IN THEIR PLACE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

    ONCE AND FOR ALL, TO ABANDON THE TRAINING OF 
    MISGUIDED, JOBLESS YOUTHS INTO PARTY MEDIA, NOT AS 
    ENEMIES OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY, BUT AS PATRIOTS AS 
    ANXIOUS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR COUNTRY AS HE 
    AND ZANU PF OUGHT TO BE.  LIFE MAY GO ON AFTER 
    EXPULSION FROM THE COMMONWEALTH, BUT ZIMBABWE 
    WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME." 
 
¶3.   "MUGABE'S OPTIONS," THE "FINANCIAL GAZETTE" 
    (03/21) COMMENTS: 
 
    "EVEN BEFORE HE TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE TO START A 
    NEW SIX-YEAR TERM, PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE LAST 
    WEEK SIGNALED THE DIRECTION OF HIS GOVERNMENT BY 
    IMMEDIATELY SIGNING INTO LAW THE CONTROVERSIAL 
    ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PROTECTION OF PRIVACY 
    BILL.  THE NEW LAW. . .BULLDOZED THROUGH 
    PARLIAMENT JUST BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, 
    NOT ONLY STIFLES PRESS FREEDOM IN ZIMBABWE BUT 
    THREATENS TO SHUT DOWN THE COUNTRY'S ENTIRE 
    INDEPENDENT NEWS MEDIA. . .   HOW CAN THE 
    PRESIDENT RECONCILE THE FACT THAT ON ONE HAND HE 
    WANTS COOPERATION FROM THE OPPOSITION WHILE ON THE 
    OTHER HE LAUNCHES A CRACKDOWN ON ITS MEMBERS? 
    INDEED, HOW CAN A CONCILIATORY PRESIDENT WHO IS 
    DETERMINED TO HEAL THE NATION'S BLOODLETTING AND 
    PALPABLE PAIN OF THOSE WHO REGARD HIS ELECTION AS 
    STOLEN GO AHEAD WITH A BILL WHICH DEPRIVES THE 
    NATION OF INFORMATION THAT IS SO VITAL TO DECISION- 
    MAKING?. . ."
