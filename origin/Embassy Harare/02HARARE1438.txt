SUBJECT: TWO NEW NEWSPAPERS HIT THE STREETS 
 
 
¶1.   Two new newspapers debuted in Harare during the week 
    of June 10.  "The Business Tribune" and its sister 
    publication "The Weekend Tribune" will hit the streets 
    every Thursday and Saturday respectively. 
 
¶2.   The Media Africa Group (MAG), a consortium of 
    businessmen led by a well-known ZANU PF business ally, Mr. 
    Mutumwa Mawere, publishes the new papers.  Part of MAG's 
    Editorial Charter reads: "MAG is a privately owned 
    newspaper publishing company established in 2002 which is 
    not aligned to any group or political party in Zimbabwe, 
    Southern African Development Community (SADC), or anywhere 
    in the world.  In short we are politically neutral and 
    impartial.  In Zimbabwe, we vow to pursue a middle-of-the- 
    road, apolitical path that necessitates that we report 
    business, political and other events as they happen..."
