¶3.  SADC Attempts to Imose Political Solution... At a SADC summit 
in Soth Africa on November 9, where only five heads of tate 
(including Mugabe) were represented, SADC dscussed the political 
impasse in Zimbabwe and ina communiqu suggested that the MDC and 
ZANU-PF form a government and share the Home Affairs Ministry.  MDC 
leader Tsvangirai rejected this proposal.  The MDC issued a 
statement opposing not only the Home Affairs solution, but also 
criticizing SADC for failing to tackle other issues:  an equitable 
distribution of all ministries, agreement on Constitutional 
Amendment 19 (encapsulating the September 15 agreement) as a 
precondition to establishment of a government, agreement on division 
of provincial governors, composition of the national security 
council, and discrepancies between what was agree to by the parties 
on September 11 and what was signed on September 15.    In an 
interview on November 13, Arthur Mutambara told the press that 
Zimbabwean leaders should respect SADC's resolution, but Mutambara 
has so far indicated he will not enter the government unless 
Tsvangirai does. 
 
¶4.  Protesters Beaten by Police, One Miscarried in Custody... The 
National Constitutional Assembly (NCA) held protests in five cities 
on November 11, calling for a political solution.  Riot police broke 
up protests in four cities and arrested over two dozen protesters. 
NCA reports that one woman who was three months pregnant was kicked 
repeatedly while in police custody in Mutare and had a miscarriage. 
Some protesters have been released after paying a fine.  Police 
preventively detained NCA leader Lovemore Madhuku for about four 
hours to prevent him from participating.

¶5.  RBZ Returns Global Fund Money... Less than a week after The New 
York Times broke the story on the Reserve Bank's "diversion" of over 
US$7 million that was donated to Zimbabwe by the Global Fund for 
AIDS, TB, and Malaria, the RBZ returned the funds to the account. 
Zimbabwe's application for Round 8 funding was approved this week. 
 
¶6.  Diamonds are a Crooked Politician's Best Friend... Zimbabwe's 
diamond fields have become a source for those with connections to 
enrich themselves.  See Harare 1016 
 
¶7.  Visiting American Surgical Team Moves to Private Hospital... The 
volunteer medical team providing free cleft lip and palate 
operations moved from the largely defunct government-run Harare 
Central Hospital to the privately-funded St. Anne's Hospital in 
Harare.  Inadequate facilities at Harare Central limited the number 
of operations they could perform.  The team is scheduled to leave 
Harare on November 15 and plans to come back in six months for 
another round of surgeries.  See:

¶8.  African Human Rights Commission Berates Zimbabwe... The African 
Commission for Human and People's Rights, meeting in Nigeria, 
criticized Zimbabwe for its atrocious human rights record in recent 
years, particularly in 2008.  It called on the AU and SADC to, "to 
impress upon Zimbabwean authorities to take effective measures to 
stop all forms of politically motivated violence and allow for free 
political activity, including the opening up of space for the media 
and civil society.... [and] to remind Zimbabwe of its obligations to 
regional and international agreements and its current violation of 
the human rights in relation to continued detentions, threats and 
gender biased violence." 
 
¶9.  Zim troops in DRC?... The BBC reported that Zimbabwean troops 
are in the Democratic Republic of Congo to perform duties that 
include guarding mines.  See: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/ 
africa/7726690.stm 
 
---------------------------------- 
On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  Air Zimbabwe Demands Fares In Foreign Exchange... In line with 
increased dollarization in the country, Air Zimbabwe is no longer 
accepting payment for regional and international air fares in 
Zimbabwe dollars.  Only local routes will be payable in local 
currency.  The measure is designed to enable Air Zimbabwe to meet 
its external debt obligations and to pay for spare parts and other 
costs which account for 90 percent of the company's costs. 
 
¶11.  Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Re-instates RTGS... Typical of 
RBZ governor Gideon Gono's policy flip-flopping in recent years, the 
RBZ has re-instated the real time gross settlement (RTGS) system 
which was suspended against technical advice from his advisers 
barely a month ago.  According to the RBZ, all transactions going 
through the system must have a minimum threshold of Z$5 billion 
(about US$8).  Gono advises that commercial banks employ the 'know 
your customer' principle in order to prevent abuse of the system. 
 
 
¶12.  Cash Withdrawal Limit For Companies Raised and Forex Surrender 
Requirements Relaxed... The RBZ stated that companies can now 
withdraw cash equivalent to 120 percent of their previous week's 
cash deposits, while foreign exchange licensed shops are now 
required to sell only 7.5 percent of their proceeds to the RBZ as 
opposed to the current 15 percent. The measures which appear to be a 
 
HARARE 00001025  003 OF 003 
 
 
direct response to demands y industry are designed to address the 
queues at banks and the high prices of goods in foreign exchange 
licensed shops. 
 
¶13.  Power Utility Stops Accepting Checks For Settlement Of Bills... 
The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) has stopped 
accepting checks as a form of payment for electricity consumed.  The 
move, which comes hard on the heels of a steep increase in tariffs 
two weeks ago, will make it very hard for consumers to pay as they 
are only allowed to withdraw Z$500,000 from the bank daily. 
 
¶14.  Zimplats to Cease Open Pit Mining... Zimbabwe's platinum 
producer, Zimplats Holdings, will cease the more expensive open pit 
mining at its Ngezi Mine at the end of this month following a 
sustained fall in platinum prices from US$2,200 per ton in March 
2008 to US$846.89 per ton by November 7, 2008 in Europe.  According 
to a company report published last week, management is exploring 
options to increase the cheaper underground ore production in order 
to take advantage of processing capacity that will become available 
with the commissioning of the Ngezi Concentrator in April 2009.
