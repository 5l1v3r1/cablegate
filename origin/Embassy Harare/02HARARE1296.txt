SUBJECT: "STANDARD" EDITOR ARRESTED FIFTH TIME 
 
 
¶1.   On May 29 Bornwell Chakaodza, editor of the 
    independent weekly "Standard," was arrested for the 
    fifth time in less than two weeks.  The May 29 arrest 
    was, like the May 28 arrest, sparked by a story in the 
    Standard detailing conditions Chakaodza and two of his 
    colleagues encountered in the Harare jail when they 
    were held overnight on May 16.  The May 29 arrest, 
    however, was for violating a ban on "revealing 
    internal police matters." 
¶2.   Chakaodza's previous arrests were on May 16, 22, 
    23 and 28.  He has not been mistreated by police and, 
    after the initial arrest on May 16, has not been held 
    overnight.
