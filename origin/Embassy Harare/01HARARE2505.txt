SUBJECT: JUSTICE MINISTER ANNOUNCES MOVE TO LIMIT CIVIC 
EDUCATION 
 
 
¶1.   STATE-CONTROLLED ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION 
    TELEVISION AND RADIO, AND THE STATE-CONTROLLED DAILY 
    "HERALD," REPORTED ON AUGUST 22 AND 23 THAT MINISTER OF 
    JUSTICE PATRICK CHINAMASA WILL PROPOSE LIMITS ON CIVIC 
    EDUCATION ACTIVITIES IN ZIMBABWE. 
 
¶2.   UNDER THE HEADLINE "ESC TO APPROVE ALL VOTER 
    EDUCATION, THE AUGUST 23 "HERALD" REPORTED ".THE MINISTER. 
    HAS PROPOSED THAT THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION 
    (ESC) SHOULD HAVE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF CARRYING OUT VOTER 
    EDUCATION AHEAD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION NEXT YEAR. 
    CHINAMASA SAID HE WILL PROPOSE TO CABINET A POLICY THAT 
    WOULD ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION IS DISSEMINATED IN A 
    NEUTRAL, ACCURATE AND INFORMED MANNER... SOME OF 
    RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE PUT BEFORE CABINET INCLUDE THE 
    BANNING OF FOREIGN FUNDING FOR VOTER EDUCATION, EXCEPT WHEN 
    CHANNELED THROUGH THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION. 
    THIS WOULD PROHIBIT FOREIGN NGOS FROM CONDUCTING VOTER 
    EDUCATION AND PERMIT LOCAL NGOS TO CONDUCT THE EDUCATION 
    ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN REGISTERED BY THE ESC.  HOWEVER, 
    NGOS WOULD NEED TO COMPLY WITH CONDITIONS SET BY THE ESC TO 
    DISCLOSE SOURCES OF FUNDING.  ALL VOTER EDUCATION MODULES 
    WOULD ALSO BE APPROVED BY THE ESC.   ALL POLITICAL PARTIES 
    WILL BE ALLOWED TO CONDUCT VOTER EDUCATION BUT USING 
    MODULES DEVELOPED BY THE COMMISSION." 
 
¶3.   ACCORDING TO THE "HERALD" STORY, CHINAMASA WENT ON TO 
    SAY THAT THESE CHANGES WERE IN RESPONSE TO THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  02505  240956Z 
    ".REALIZATION THAT SOME NGOS WERE APPROACHING PEOPLE UNDER 
    THE GUISE OF PROVIDING NEUTRAL EDUCATION, THEREBY GAINING 
    THE PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE AND ABUSING THE TRUST BY 
    INFLUENCING THE ELECTORATE." 
 
¶4.   CHINAMASA'S COMMENTS WERE MADE DURING PARLIAMENTARY 
    QUESTION TIME ON AUGUST 22, IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST FROM 
    THE MDC CHIEF WHIP TO CLARIFY THE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION ON 
    VOTER EDUCATION CONDUCTED BY NGOS.
