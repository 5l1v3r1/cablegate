  ¶1.   Stung by the recent detention and deportation of 
      former Bulawayo mayor Joshua Malinga at Gatwick Airport 
      (London) and Sweden's refusal of visas to four ZANU-PF 
      women legislators, an editorial in the August 5 edition of 
      the government-controlled daily "The Herald" calls on the 
      government of Zimbabwe to hit back.  Under headline "Zim 
      should take retaliatory steps" the paper comments: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .It is now time for Zimbabwe to consider 
      implementing the eye for an eye rule. . .The 
      international community should not cry foul when 
      government puts in place measures that will in turn 
      prohibit the movement of some Westerners to 
      Zimbabwe. . .The government should now take 
      retaliatory steps, which should include the 
      withdrawal of passports from political 
      opponents. . . ."
