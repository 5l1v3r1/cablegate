ZIMBABWEANS TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD DEMOCRACY 
 
 
¶1.   Under the title "A luta continua" ("the struggle 
   continues") the independent weekly "The Standard's" 
   April 18 editorial was a farewell from editor March 
   Chavhunduka and a call for Zimbabwe to continue seeking 
   democracy. Chavhunduka, who was tortured by Zimbabwean 
   military authorities in early 1999 for publishing an 
   article alleging an attempted coup in the Zimbabwean 
   Army, has edited the newspaper since its launch in 
   ¶1997.  He has recently acquired Thompson Publishing 
   Company and will leave the "Standard" to take over 
   management of his new company. Chavhunduka was an IV 
   grantee in 1992.  Excerpts: 
 
¶2.   ". . .Despite all the trials and tribulations that 
   I and colleagues have gone through and at the hands of 
   an increasingly intolerant and paranoid regime, and 
   having suffered the same injustices as thousands of 
   Zimbabweans, many of whose stories have never hit 
   newspaper headlines, I strongly believe that all 
   Zimbabweans who cherish the ideals of a free, open and 
   democratic society should close ranks to fight to the 
   end the lawlessness, corruption, and anarchy prevailing 
   in the country.  There is power in numbers.  No amount 
   of twisting election results or murdering of people can 
   sustain an illegitimate government forever, and so it 
   is important that Zimbabweans not lose hope over the 
   outcome of one presidential or parliamentary election, 
   but continue to stand firm and united in the demand for 
   the country to return to civilized normalcy.  Once 
   anarchy sets in among the people, then that is 
   tantamount to handing the country over to the devil on 
   a silver platter.  We at 'The Standard' can safely say 
   we have consistently played our part in this endeavor, 
   and it is my hope and belief that the paper will 
   continue along the path, despite the minefields ahead. 
   The paper will not falter. . .   We remain together in 
   the struggle for peace and justice."
