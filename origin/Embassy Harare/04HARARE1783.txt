¶1. (SBU) Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Union (ZCTU) 
officials have not decided whether or how to protest the 
GOZ's deportation of a Congress of South African Trade 
Union (COSATU) delegation from Zimbabwe.  ZCTU Vice 
President Lucia Matibenga told us her labor body is 
waiting to see whether COSATU initiates its own protest, 
such as an interruption of passenger or cargo traffic 
between the two countries. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Matibenga said ZCTU officials and South African 
Deputy Chief of Mission Kingsley Sithole were in constant 
telephone contact until the GOZ took the thirteen COSATU 
delegates across the border yesterday morning, but she 
expressed frustration with these exchanges.  Matibenga 
said Sithole repeatedly criticized COSATU for undertaking 
a fact-finding mission without GOZ concurrence.  South 
African Ambassador Jeremiah Ndou has declined public 
comment. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Although ZCTU officials regret the 
harsh handling of their COSATU counterparts, they are no 
doubt pleased that GOZ suppression of civil liberties is 
gaining wider coverage in South Africa.  In reality, ZCTU 
officials have few options and admit Zimbabweans have 
grown weary of stayaways, especially since the opposition 
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC)'s failed "Final 
Push" in mid-2003.  For that reason, ZCTU officials 
welcome any revived COSATU protest against the GOZ, 
especially if this week's events move COSATU closer to an 
oft-threatened but never implemented "blockade" of 
Zimbabwe.  However, the rather passive approach of the 
ZCTU - basically to sit back and watch events unfold - is 
not encouraging.
