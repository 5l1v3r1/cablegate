¶1. The following is Embassy Harare's nomination for the Secretary of 
State's Award for International Women of Courage.

Zimbabwe (GAPWUZ) 
DOB: 23-NOV-1961

Citizenship: Zimbabwean

PASSPORT NUMBER: BN625350 
 
¶2. Gertrude is a well-known civil society leader currently serving 
as Secretary General for the General Agriculture and Plantation 
Workers of Zimbabwe (GAPWUZ), established in 1985 to represent farm 
workers in issues of labor rights, governance, civic participation, 
gender, HIV/AIDS, youth, education, and child labor alleviation. 
Farm workers and their families are among the most vulnerable groups 
in Zimbabwe as their wages and living conditions continue to 
dwindle.  The children, orphans, and spouses of tens of thousands of 
farm workers directly benefit from GAPWUZ's activities that support 
improving and regulating the relationship between farm operators and 
farm workers.  As Secretary General, Gertrude has been a tireless 
advocate for farm workers and their families, particularly women and 
children, in support of adequate wages, living conditions, and 
educational opportunities. 
 
¶3. Throughout the past year, Gertrude and GAPWUZ have faced 
increased intimidation, political violence, and forced displacement. 
Before Zimbabwe's elections in March of this year, GAPWUZ ensured 
farm workers understood where and how to vote, despite increasing 
hostility from the government.  GAPWUZ members also participated in 
domestic election monitoring under Gertrude's leadership.  During 
the election-related violence that ravaged the country, many farm 
workers and their families were targeted by ZANU-PF supporters and 
militias who perceived commercial farm workers as MDC supporters and 
tens of thousands were displaced.  Gertrude led her organization in 
playing an important role in drawing attention to their plight - 
including the unique difficulties facing displaced women and 
children - and offered them assistance in seeking temporary 
accommodation. 
 
¶4. The increased political violence in 2008 was also closely 
associated with increased sexual violence, including rape as a 
political tool, particularly in rural areas.  GAPWUZ conducted 
surveys and helped provide support to rape victims during the year, 
despite social taboos that prevent most women from speaking out 
about having been raped and risks of retribution by perpetrators. 
 
¶5. In Zimbabwe's desperate economic times, many parents cannot 
afford to send their children to school, and children, often several 
years younger than the legal minimum age, must work.  Gertrude has 
conducted studies of child trafficking and child labor, has 
successfully lobbied employers and the Government of Zimbabwe for 
better working conditions, and has overseen pilot projects to 
protect child laborers and help keep disadvantaged children in 
school. 
 
¶6. Gertrude is among the most outspoken and respected civil society 
leaders in Zimbabwe.  She consistently exposes injustice and faces 
constant threat as a result.  For instance, in January Gertrude was 
attending her regular Anglican church service in Harare.  When a 
disturbance broke out between followers of Bishop Sebastian Bakare 
and supporters of ousted ZANU-PF-supported Bishop Kunonga during the 
service, she began photographing the commotion and was subsequently 
arrested.  Police - recognizing her and her leadership role in civil 
society - held her for several hours before releasing her. 
 
¶7. Gertrude's efforts and dedication have been well-documented over 
the years.  In 2007, she received the inaugural Democracy and Human 
Rights Award from the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition in recognition of 
her work in human rights advocacy within farming communities in 
Zimbabwe.  Throughout this difficult year and for more than a 
decade, GAPWUZ and Gertrude Hambira have stood up to the brutal 
Mugabe regime and defended the labor, security, and human rights of 
Zimbabwean farm workers and their families.  We are proud to 
nominate Gertrude Hambira for the Secretary's International Women of 
Courage Award.  We firmly believe that the selection of Gertrude 
will send a strong message to the Government of Zimbabwe that the 
world is still watching. 
 
¶8. Gertrude was informed of Post's submission of this nomination.
