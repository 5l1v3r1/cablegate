  ¶1.   Under headline "Zim losing out on HIV/Aids global 
      fund," the July 18 edition of the independent weekly "The 
      Standard" carried the following editorial on page 8: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .Although the war on HIV/AIDS is being fought on 
      many fronts. . .there is no doubt that this disease 
      has become the leading killer in this country 
      (Zimbabwe) and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.  The 
      incredible orphan crisis in this country and 
      elsewhere has to be seen to be believed.  Women and 
      children are at the heart of this HIV/Aids crisis. 
      We are, indeed, dealing with a humanitarian crisis of 
      enormous proportions.  Unlike all the countries in 
      sub-Saharan Africa, Zimbabwe is losing out as far as 
      the international partnership against HIV and Aids in 
      Africa is concerned.  The people of Zimbabwe are 
      being punished because of the misgovernance and 
      wayward behavior of their political leadership. 
 
      ". . .We need cheap generic AIDS drugs and 
      accelerated testing to halt progression of HIV and 
      Aids in Zimbabwe.  But we cannot hope to make a 
      difference if we are cut off from the global resource 
      base that other sub-Saharan countries are tapping 
      into because of the misdemeanors of our political 
      leaders.  It is in this context that we call on the 
      international community to make a clear distinction 
      between the political leadership of a country and the 
      population of a country.  People cannot be made to 
      suffer for the sins of their leadership.  By all 
      means, punish the leaders but spare the citizens. . . 
      ."
