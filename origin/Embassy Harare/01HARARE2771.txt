¶1.   MAINSTREAM NEWSPAPERS CONTINUE TO CARRY OPINION 
    PIECES AND OP-ED ARTICLES FOCUSING ON THE SEPTEMBER 11 
    BOMBINGS OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AND THE 
    PENTAGON.  THESE ARTICLES BOTH REFLECT AND LEAD 
    ZIMBABWEAN POPULAR OPINION ON THE ATTACKS.  IN 
    GENERAL, THE ZIMBABWEAN MOOD IS THAT THE ATTACKS 
    WERE HORRIBLE AND SENSELESS ASSAULTS ON INNOCENT 
    PEOPLE.  EXPRESSIONS OF CONDOLENCE HAVE BEEN 
    POURING IN TO THE U.S. MISSION IN ZIMBABWE.  AT 
    THE SAME TIME, THERE IS AN UNDERCURRENT OF PUBLIC 
    OPINION ALONG THE LINES OF ".THE U.S. MUST EXPECT 
    TO PAY SOME PRICE FOR ITS SINS AND SELF-ASSUMED 
    ROLE OF GLOBAL POLICEMAN."  ZIMBABWEANS ARE ALSO 
    CONCERNED ABOUT THE U.S. RESPONSE TO THE ATTACKS 
    AND, TRUE TO THEIR NATURE, GENERALLY ENDORSE 
    PATIENCE AND PRUDENCE.  ARTICLE EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   UNDER HEADLINE 'U. S. MUST SEARCH DEEP WITHIN ITS 
    CONSCIENCE," THE SEPTEMBER 20 EDITION OF THE 
    INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE FINANCIAL GAZETTE" 
    CARRIED THE FOLLOWING OPINION PIECE AUTHORED BY 
    MAGGIE MZUMARA, A ZIMBABWEAN JOURNALIST, WRITER 
    AND SOCIAL COMMENTATOR CURRENTLY BASED IN NEW 
    YORK: 
 
    ". . .(AMERICA) IS A NATION HUMBLED, A NATION 
ROBBED, 
    AND A NATION OUTRAGED.  TRUE, ALL THAT.  BUT AT 
    SOME POINT AMERICA HAS TO STOP DWELLING ON ONLY 
    'WHAT' HAS HAPPENED AND 'HOW' IT HAS HAPPENED AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

    LOOK AT SOME FACTS. . .  TO CONCENTRATE ONLY ON 
    AND TO STOP AT 'SMOKING OUT BIN LADEN FROM HIS 
    HIDING HOLES' AND WIPING AWAY ALL THOSE WHO 
    'HARBOR TERRORISTS' IS AT BEST INCOMPLETE AND AT 
    WORST MISSING THE POINT.  I AM NOT SAYING AMERICA 
    IS NOT JUSTIFIED IN SEEKING JUSTICE.  IT IS AND 
    IF THE JUSTICE TO THE AMERICANS INCLUDES 
    RETALIATING MILITARILY, SO BE IT.  BUT THAT KIND 
    OF JUSTICE WILL AND CAN ONLY BE MEANINGFUL IF IT 
    IS ACCOMPANIED BY A DEEPER LOOK AT THE ROOT 
    CAUSES OF THE FEELINGS BEHIND LAST WEEK'S 
    CATASTROPHE. . .  BUT AMERICA HAS THREE 
    WEAKNESSES.  THREE MAJOR VICES: RUTHLESSNESS, 
    SELFISHNESS AND ARROGANCE.  AMERICA IS ARROGANT. 
    SO ARROGANT IN FACT THAT IT IS NOW, AS IN THE 
    PAST, DESPERATELY PROTECTING ITS INNOCENCE BY 
    REFUSING TO LOOK AT THE FACTS.  AMERICA AS A 
    NATION IS SO BLINDED BY ARROGANCE IT FAILS TO 
    RESPECT THAT WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM ITSELF, BE 
    IT RELIGION, WAY OF LIFE, SOCIAL OR POLITICAL 
    SYSTEM. . .'  IT HAS TO BE AMERICAN OR ELSE ITS 
    NOTHING' SEEMS TO BE THE SWEEPING FEELING HERE. 
    IN ITS SELFISH AND RUTHLESS PURSUIT AND 
    PROTECTION OF ITS INTERESTS, AMERICA HAS 
    DESTROYED CULTURES, ENSLAVED OTHERS AND COMMITTED 
    BIGOTRY.  AS A RESULT OF ITS THREE WEAKNESSES, 
    THERE IS ALONG LIST OF GRIEVANCES AGAINST 
    AMERICANS KNOWN AND RECOGNIZED BY MANY WHO HAVE 
    STUDIED THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF THIS OTHERWISE 
    GREAT NATION.  GRIEVANCES LIKE AGGRESSIVE WESTERN 
    EXPANSIONISM AND MANIPULATION OF COUNTRIES AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

    ECONOMIES ARE AT THE ROOT OF THE MOTIVE BEHIND 
    THE DESTRUCTION OF ITS SYMBOL OF PROSPERITY AND 
    FREEDOM, THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, AND ITS SYMBOL 
    OF MILITARY PROWESS, THE PENTAGON. . .PERHAPS THE 
    ¶U. S. NEEDS TO REVISE SOME OF ITS STANCES, 
    ATTITUDES AND POLICIES THAT SEEM TO MAKE MORE 
    ENEMIES THAN FRIENDS.  THE U. S. NEEDS TO THINK 
    ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT ITS FREEDOM IS INFRINGING 
    UPON AND DISRESPECTING OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES, 
    RELIGIONS AND THEIR WORLD AS THEY KNOW AND WANT 
    IT. . . WAGING A WAR AGAINST TERRORISM MAY REAP A 
    VICTORY FOR THE U. S. AND ITS FREEDOM IDEALS. 
    BUT SUCH A VICTORY, HOWEVER IMPORTANT
