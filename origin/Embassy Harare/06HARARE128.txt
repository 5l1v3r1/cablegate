REF: STATE 226696 
 
¶1. Summary.  Embassy Harare submits the following 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) proposal for 
funding consideration from FY2006 ESF appropriations.  The 
proposal is for assistance to IOM's activities in Zimbabwe as 
part of the Southern African Counter-Trafficking Assistance 
Program (SACTAP).  SACTAP has completed its pilot phase, and 
IOM is proposing a three-year program to continue its 
successful activities in Zimbabwe.  We submit the full 
three-year proposal with the intention of funding the 2nd and 
3rd year activities from FY2007 and FY2008 funds.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. Title:  Southern African Counter-Trafficking Assistance 
Program (SACTAP)- Zimbabwe 
 
¶3. Name of recipient organization: International Organization 
for Migration (IOM) 
 
¶4. Duration of project and whether project is new or ongoing: 
Three years. The project is ongoing. 
 
¶5. Project description: The project would include three main 
activities--information and awareness raising, capacity 
building of NGOs, and victim support. 
 
--Information and awareness raising.  IOM conducted a 
successful awareness campaign in 2005 based on radio spots. 
The information and awareness raising activities would 
include continued radio spots that warn of the threat posed 
by human traffickers.  In addition, IOM would develop a 
counter-trafficking radio drama consisting of thirteen 
20-minute episodes to be aired over a three-month period. 
IOM would also develop a one-hour counter-trafficking video 
to be screened at universities and urban community centers 
and distributed to government, civil society, and the media. 
In the third year, IOM would develop a mobile unit to show 
the video in the rural areas. 
 
--Capacity building.  The capacity building activities would 
include three workshops for civil society organizations in 
areas related to anti-trafficking in persons, such as women's 
and children's rights organizations, in response to civil 
society requests for such training.  IOM would also offer a 
program to train trainers and support those trainers. 
 
--Victim support.  The victim support activity would consist 
of completing a high security reception facility for 
returning migrants who are victims of trafficking.  The 
reception center would provide reception and reintegration 
services, such as psychosocial counseling and skills training. 
 
¶6. Performance indicators: a) number of victims assisted by 
civil society protection network; b) survey of reach of 
awareness efforts; c) number of victims assisted by reception 
facility. 
 
¶7. Evaluation plan: Embassy officials will meet with IOM 
staff every month, attend at least one workshop, monitor the 
airing of the radio spots, monitor the production of the 
video, and visit the site of the reception center at least 
once.
