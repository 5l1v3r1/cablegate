¶1. THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" DEDICATED ITS 
SEPTEMBER 5 EDITORIAL TO THE U. N. CONFERENCE ON RACISM IN 
DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA.  UNDER HEADLINE "DURBAN CONFERENCE: 
VICTORY FOR RACISM WOULD BE GHASTLY," THE EDITORIAL COMMENTS: 
 
¶2. "MANY PEOPLE WOULD NOT HELP SYMPATHIZING WITH THE SOUTH 
AFRICAN PRESIDENT, THABO MBEKI, IF THE UNITED NATIONS 
CONFERENCE ON RACISM. . .ENDS UP WITHOUT A SINGLE AND 
SINCERELY UNANIMOUS RESOLUTION ON HOW TO TACKLE THE SCOURGE 
WORLDWIDE.  RADICALS ON THE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE OF ZIONISM 
BEING EQUATED WITH RACISM AND THE EQUALLY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE 
OF REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERY MAY NOT HAVE HIJACKED THE ENTIRE 
CONFERENCE, BUT THEY CERTAINLY HAVE MUDDIED THE WATERS, 
ENOUGH TO REDUCE VERY SERIOUSLY THE CHANCES OF A CONSENSUS ON 
BOTH ISSUES AT THE END OF THE CONFERENCE LATER THIS WEEK. 
THE WALKOUT BY THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAELI DELEGATIONS IS 
TO BE DEEPLY REGRETTED, BUT THE CONFERENCE MUST SLOG ON, 
DETERMINED TO END ON AN OPTIMISTIC NOTE, HOWEVER 
PROBLEMATICAL THAT MAY BE.  A VICTORY FOR RACISM, XENOPHOBIA 
AND INTOLERANCE, WHICH THE ABSENCE OF CONSENSUS WOULD 
DEFINITELY SIGNAL TO THE WORLD, IS TOO GHASTLY TO 
CONTEMPLATE.  ALL THE HOPES FOR A RELATIVELY UNITED, HATE- 
FREE GLOBAL VILLAGE AS WE BEGIN THIS THIRD MILLENNIUM, WOULD 
BE SHATTERED FOR A LONG TIME TO COME IF THE DELEGATES FAILED 
TO ENDORSE UNANIMOUSLY A RESOLUTION CONDEMNING RACISM AND ITS 
ALLIED 
CURSES. . .IT WOULD BE TRAGIC IF THE AFRICANS AND THEIR 
ALLIES, DEMANDING REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERY, BECAME SO OBDURATE 
THEY REFUSED TO LISTEN TO THE MODERATE VOICE OF NIGERIA'S 
PRESIDENT, OLUSEGUN OBASANJO, WHO HAS SAID AN APOLOGY WOULD 
BE ENOUGH. . .REPARATIONS CANNOT BE ULTIMATE PANACEA FOR THE 
CONTINENT'S POVERTY.  ALL SELF-RESPECTING AFRICAN LEADERS 
MUST KNOW THAT ONLY THEY AND THEY ALONE CAN MAKE AN IMPACT ON 
                       UNCLASSIFIED
