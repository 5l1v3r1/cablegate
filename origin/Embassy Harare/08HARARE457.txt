¶1. (SBU)  Embassy Harare's EAC met on May 22 to review the 
political situation, including the confirmation of the 
announcement of the election runoff date of June 27, the 
current Travel Alert, and the Mission's security posture. 
The Ambassador chaired the meeting.  In attendance were 
representatives from RSO, POL/ECON, CONS, USAID, MGT, R/POL, 
CDC, GSO, IMO, CLO, and MSG. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The Ambassador confirmed the runoff election date 
of June 27 and explained that politically motivated violence 
continues to escalate, especially in the rural areas, and the 
Embassy continues to receive shocking reports of targeted 
violence directed against opposition members and suspected 
opposition supporters.  Pol/Econ and R/POL concurred that 
these reports of violence in the rural areas continue 
unabated.  It was also noted that many affected by the 
violence and intimidation have begun to move to the city for 
treatment and protection and have been gathering in 
make-shift camps near residential areas. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  EAC members agreed that Embassy business has 
remained largely unaffected by the current political 
situation, especially in and around Harare. 
 
¶4. (SBU) RSO commented that there are no reports of Americans 
being specifically targeted for crime or harassment, however 
overall crime in Harare appears to be on the increase, with 
smash-and-grab attacks and attempted burglary events 
continuing to happen with regularity.  Two issues of concern 
for the upcoming weekend were discussed, including a planned 
march by youth party members and students in Harare and a 
funeral of a high-profile MDC activist in the Harare Mabvuku 
township.  RSO will issue a Security Notice prior to the 
weekend and CONOFF will issue a Warden Message if warranted. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  CONOFF presented the current Travel Alert for EAC 
review, suggesting stronger language, as the date approaches 
for the runoff election, regarding travel and security 
posture in the rural areas immediately before and after the 
runoff.  EAC agreed on the new language and CONOFF will 
submit the revised Travel Alert to CA for approval and 
issuance. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  EAC members agreed that the Mission's current 
security posture, which includes continued case-by-case 
review of in-country travel requests, remains appropriate. 
Country clearance requests will also be reviewed, and 
non-essential travel will be discouraged during the week 
before the June 27 election until the results are announced.
