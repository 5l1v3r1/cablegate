SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT: BUSINESSMAN STRIVE MASIYIWA RECOUNTS 
1990 DETENTION BY ZIMBABWEAN CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE 
ORGANIZATION 
 
 
¶1. THE AUGUST 9 EDITION OF THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" 
   CARRIES A PAGE-ONE STORY ABOUT BUSINESSMAN STRIVE 
   MASIYIWA'S 1990 DETENTION BY MEMBERS OF ZIMBABWE'S 
   CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION (CIO).  THE STORY 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HARARE  04446  091253Z 
   LINKS MASIYIWA'S DETENTION TO A RECENT ALLEGED 
   ASSASSINATION THREAT TO "DAILY NEWS" EDITOR GEOFF 
   NYAROTA.  ACCORDING TO THE NEWS STORY, THE LINK IS THAT 
   MASIYIWA'S ABDUCTOR IN 1990, ROBERT MANUNGO, IS THE 
   PERSON NYAROTA'S WOULD-BE KILLER ALLEGED GAVE HIM THE 
   ASSASSINATION ASSIGNMENT. 
¶2. STRIVE MASIYIWA IS THE CEO OF ECONET WIRELESS HOLDINGS, 
   AND ONE OF ZIMBABWE'S MOST SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMEN.  HE 
   HAS A LONG HISTORY OF STRUGGLING AGAINST GOVERNMENT 
   BUREAUCRACY AND CORRUPTION, AND HAS BEEN IN SOUTH AFRICA 
   FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BECAUSE OF HIS FEAR THAT HE WOULD BE 
   ARRESTED FOR POLITICAL REASONS IF HE RETURNS TO 
   ZIMBABWE.  HE IS PERCEIVED TO SUPPORT ZIMBABWE'S 
   OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) AND IS 
   SAID TO BE WORRIED THAT THIS PERCEPTION MAKES HIM 
   VULNERABLE TO TRUMPED-UP CHARGES AND LEGAL CHALLENGES. 
¶3. THE ARTICLE QUOTES MASIYIWA EXTENSIVELY, AND RECOUNTS 
   HIS 1990 ABDUCTION AND DETENTION BY CIO AGENTS. 
   MASIYIWA SAYS HE WAS TAKEN AT GUNPOINT FROM HIS OFFICE 
   BY TWO CIO AGENTS, ONE OF WHOM, ROBERT MANUNGO, IS 
   ALLEGED TO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ARRANGE THE ASSASSINATION 
   OF "DAILY NEWS" EDITOR GEOFF NYAROTA.  THIS ALLEGATION 
   COMES FROM THE SELF-CONFESSED, WOULD-BE ASSASSIN WHO 
   CLAIMS TO HAVE GOTTEN COLD FEET ABOUT THE KILLING AT THE 
   LAST MOMENT. 
¶4. THE ARTICLE RELATES MASIYIWA'S ACCOUNT OF THE ABDUCTION 
   AND DETENTION FOR ONE DAY AT A POLICE STATION IN 
   GOROMONZI, A SMALL TOWN ABOUT 30 MILES FROM HARARE. 
   MASIYIWA IS QUOTED IN THE STORY AS SAYING THAT HIS 
   STRONG RELIGIOUS FAITH BEGAN THE DAY OF HIS ABDUCTION. 
   HE ALSO SAYS THAT A SENIOR ZIMBABWEAN POLICE OFFICIAL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  04446  091253Z 
   TOLD HIM SEVERAL MONTHS LATER THAT HE WAS LUCKY TO HAVE 
   BEEN RELEASED ALIVE. 
¶5. MASIYIWA HAS A STRONG REPUTATION FOR HONESTY AND 
   INTEGRITY.  HIS ACCOUNT OF THE ABDUCTION AND DETENTION 
   IS CREDIBLE. THE APPARENT PURPOSE OF THE STORY IN THE 
   "DAILY NEWS" IS TO LEND CREDENCE TO REPORTS THE 
   NEWSPAPER HAS PUBLISHED IN THE PAST WEEK ABOUT THE PLOT 
   TO ASSASSINATE ITS EDITOR AND THE ALLEGED CIO CONNECTION 
   TO THAT PLOT.
