¶1. (U) SUMMARY: On May 20, ZANU-PF staged a demonstration in 
downtown Harare against MDC MP Roy Bennett.  The 
demonstration came two days after Bennett assaulted Minister 
of Justice Patrick Chinamasa in Parliament when the latter 
commented on the government seizure of Bennett's farm.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) According to eyewitnesses, trucks ferried 200 - 300 
ZANU-PF supporters to the Parliament building where 
demonstrators chanted slogans and waved placards saying: "We 
want the head of Bennett now", "MDC Murderers", Where is the 
rule of the law Bennett?" and "Flush Bennett into the Blair 
toilet".  The presidentially appointed governor for Harare, 
Witness Mangwende addressed the crowd saying Bennett was no 
longer welcome in Harare province.  ZANU-PF Harare Chairman 
Amos Midzi also thanked the demonstrators.  The crowd cheered 
as Minister of Justice Patrick Chinamasa entered Parliament. 
Police reportedly looked on. 
 
¶3. (U) The crowd then walked a few blocks to MDC headquarters 
where eyewitnesses reported that demonstrators attempted to 
break-in through the front door.  The security gates were 
pulled down, and a minor stone-throwing battle ensued between 
MDC youths and demonstrators.  Police entered MDC 
headquarters and arrested six MDC youths, carting them away 
in a police vehicle.  A ZANU-PF official addressed the crowd, 
which dispersed having been in front of MDC offices for about 
an hour.  Police closed Nelson Mandela Avenue (where the MDC 
is located) during the demonstration. 
 
¶4. (U) The demonstration came two days after Bennett 
assaulted Minister of Justice Patrick Chinamasa in 
Parliament.  Addressing the full assembly, Chinamasa 
reportedly said the government would not reverse its decision 
to acquire Bennett's farm in Chimanimani (Ref B) and that 
Bennett had forgotten that his forefathers were "thieves and 
murderers".  Reacting to the statements, Bennett charged at 
Chinamasa and pushed him to the floor.  Bennett also punched 
and floored Anti-Corruption and Anti-Monopolies Minister 
Didymus Mutasa (69). 
 
¶5. (SBU) On April 9, soldiers, police and war vets seized 
Bennett's Charleswood Estate in Chimanimani despite five (now 
six) High Court judgments affirming Bennett's right to the 
property, and calling for various government officials and 
other groups to stay away (Refs A, B).  Despite problems on 
the farm, Bennett has been able to source funds for various 
MDC activities, and there were numerous rumors that he could 
organize an armed resistance to the government. 
 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) As the country's only white MP representing a rural 
area, Bennett was embarrassing proof that the GOZ did not 
control all of rural Zimbabwe.  In addition, unsubstantiated 
rumors of Bennett-organized guerrillas, and his funding for 
opposition activities made him top the government's most 
wanted list.  Many observers were abhorred at his behavior in 
Parliament, but at least an equal number were proud of him.
