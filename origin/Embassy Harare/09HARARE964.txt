SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE AT THE EPICENTER OF RHINO POACHING 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Rhino poaching continues unabated in Zimbabwe because of 
lax law enforcement and what appears to be a growing Asian demand 
for rhino horn.  In the last three years, approximately one-quarter 
of all Zimbabwe's black rhinos have been killed by poachers.  Local 
conservationists are increasingly concerned that Zimbabwe's rhinos 
are on a path to extinction as government officials fail to take 
adequate action to stop the slaughter and bring the rhino killers 
and horn traffickers to justice.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------ 
Poaching Continues to Increase 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) A study conducted by Zimbabwean scientists was recently 
submitted to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and appears on the CITES 
webpage.  The report, "African and Asian Rhinoceroses - Status, 
Conservation and Trade," was carried out by the NGO TRAFFIC and 
details rhino conservation efforts in Zimbabwe, the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, and Nepal in response to a resolution at the 
CITES conference in The Hague in 2007 that asked for a study on 
rhino conservation in those three countries ahead of the next CITES 
meeting in Doha in March 2010. 
 
¶3. (U) Since 2005, populations of black African rhinos have been 
either stable or improving in every country in Africa except 
Zimbabwe.  Zimbabwe's black rhinos suffered significant poaching 
losses in the 1990s that reduced their population to just over 300 
animals in 1995.  Between 1995 and 2001, some of Zimbabwe's 
intensive protection zones demonstrated the highest reproduction 
rates seen in the wild, bringing the population to 500-550 black 
rhinos between 2001 and 2007.  However, since 2007, poaching has 
increased dramatically, reducing the population to just over 400 
black rhinos at present. 
 
¶4. (U) The study estimates that around 235 rhinos (both black and 
white) were killed in Zimbabwe between 2006 and 2009 -- half of all 
rhinos illegally killed in Africa during that time.  In recent years 
there has been a noticeable trend towards more sophisticated and 
violent methods of killing, including AK47 assault rifles, 
immobilizing drugs, poison, and cross-bows. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Rhino Horn as a Cancer Cure in Vietnam? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) A separate CITES report says that part of the problem is a 
growing demand for rhino horn in Vietnam, where many believe the 
horn may prevent or cure cancer.  The report says that cancer 
patients, in desperation, are willing to pay increasing sums for 
Qpatients, in desperation, are willing to pay increasing sums for 
rhino horn cures, further driving up the price and demand for rhino 
horn "cures."  Rhino conservationists in Zimbabwe believe Chinese 
and Vietnamese smugglers move rhino horn through South Africa to 
markets in Asia, mostly China and Vietnam.

Lax Law Enforcement 
------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) According to the TRAFFIC study, the number of illegal rhino 
horns entering the market has increased dramatically since 2006. 
Researchers have identified a minimum of 1,521 rhino horns that were 
destined for illegal trade since 2006, versus 664 horns between 2000 
and 2005.  In Zimbabwe and South Africa, in particular, there has 
been a dramatic decrease in the number of horns "recovered" by law 
enforcement.  In 2001, nearly 70 percent of all illegally procured 
horns were intercepted, but that figure has now dropped to less than 
10 percent. 
 
¶6. (U) A study in April 2009 of poaching incidents in Zimbabwe found 
that of 156 recorded rhino intentional killings or injuries, only 18 
incidents resulted in arrests.  Of the 41 people arrested, only six 
were convicted, three of whom were foreign nationals -- a conviction 
rate of less than three percent.  Others who were arrested were 
acquitted, released on bail, or fined. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The statistics are frustrating in the abstract, but even 
more maddening when examining specific cases. For example, on 
January 15, 2009 a 30-year-old Bulawayo woman was found in illegal 
possession of 38 unmarked processed elephant tusks, 52 unregistered 
elephant tusks, and a rhino horn.  Conservationists and journalists 
familiar with the case told us in disgust that she was fined US$400, 
the illicit elephant tusks and rhino horns were returned to her, and 
her husband -- who is widely known to be involved in a poaching ring 
-- was never investigated and is still a licensed hunter.  No one 
bothered to investigate how this woman came to be in possession of 
such large quantities of illegal ivory. 
 
¶8. (SBU) A Bulawayo-based journalist shared details of other cases 
with us.  Notably, a group of five men in their twenties were found 
in possession of 17 elephant tusks in February, which disappeared 
shortly after being stored at the Hwange police station in 
Matabeleland North.  The men were fined a total of US$200, and no 
one knows what happened to the tusks.  Separately, a group of four 
men were found in possession of eight tusks in October; they were 
fined just US$10 each.  Conservationists tell us that none of these 
cases was ever thoroughly investigated in order to determine how the 
poaching and smuggling rings worked. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Despite considerable evidence of a growing poaching 
problem, Environment Minister Frances Nhema has publicly proclaimed 
that things are under control.  At an event in June this year, he 
downplayed criticism of Zimbabwe's management of its rhinos: "There 
are systems in place to ensure that poaching will be dealt with 
Qare systems in place to ensure that poaching will be dealt with 
accordingly.  There is no room for allowing poaching in the country. 
 We are saying no to poaching." Unfortunately, there is little law 
enforcement evidence to support his claims. 
 
------------------------------ 
Senior Government Involvement? 
------------------------------ 
 
¶8. (SBU) There are persistent rumors that senior government 
officials may be involved in poaching and smuggling.  Certain names 
repeatedly resurface in the rumors, including Minister of 
Environment Frances Nhema, the Chief of Conservation at the Parks 
 
HARARE 00000964  003 OF 003 
 
 
and Wildlife Management Authority Vitalis Chadenga, Minister of 
Mines Obert Mpofu, and senior security officials including the head 
of the army, Constantine Chiwenga.  Given the lax law enforcement 
and the numerous cases in which the accused person was granted bail 
or absconded, many believe bribes or pressure from senior government 
officials is thwarting justice in these cases. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Despite these persistent allegations, neither 
conservationists nor journalists have been able to uncover 
definitive links between specific senior officials and those who are 
found in possession of illegal ivory or rhino horns.  These same 
conservationists and journalists, however, have been warned not to 
investigate too deeply into the issue, adding more legitimacy to the 
concerns that top government officials are involved. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) Rhino poaching continues at an alarming rate even while 
the environmental and security-sector elements in government 
(largely controlled by ZANU-PF) continue to proclaim that they are, 
indeed, fighting the problem.  As the March CITES meeting in Doha 
draws closer, we expect that Minister Nhema and others will continue 
to loudly defend the Zimbabwean record on conservation and blame 
inadequate resources (caused by Western-imposed sanctions, 
naturally) for any perceived shortcomings.  Some in government, like 
Minister of Tourism Walter Mzembi, have sought to remind fellow 
ministers that environmental protection is key to bringing back 
tourists and development.  However, even while those discussions 
continue, we expect we will continue to hear depressing reports from 
the field of rhino poaching. END COMMENT.
