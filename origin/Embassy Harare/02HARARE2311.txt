SUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL FOOD AID SEIZURE 
 
 
 ¶1. (U) SUMMARY. The seizure on Thursday, October 17 of 3 
metric tons of food by ZANU-PF activists in Insiza was the 
first documented incident of international food aid theft and 
partisan redistribution.  The Government has denied the 
allegations and tried to divert attention from ZANU-PF food 
aid theft to British involvement in food distribution. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On Friday, October 18, the World Food Program 
indefinitely suspended food distributions in Insiza district, 
Matebeleland South, where a parliamentary by-election is 
scheduled to take place October 26-67.  ZANU-PF activists 
seized 3 metric tons of food from WFP,s implementing 
partner, Organization of Rural Associations for Progress 
(ORAP), on Thursday October 17 and began distributing it in 
an unauthorized manner.  A relatively small portion of the 
food seized was U.S.-donated cooking oil.  (NOTE: Mrs. 
Sithembiso Nyoni, who is now Minister of Small and Medium 
Enterprise Development, founded ORAP in 1981.  Both political 
parties have accused ORAP of being partisan in its relief 
activities but checks by us and WFP have shown ORAP to be 
diligently implementing WFP distribution guidelines. END 
NOTE)  Explaining WFP's decision to suspend operations in 
Insiza, WFP country director Kevin Farrell told journalists 
that WFP will only distribute its food on the basis of need 
without regard to political affiliation.  He said WFP is 
seeking assurances from the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) that 
such incidents will not take place again. 
 
¶3. (U) ZANU-PF dismissed the report as false and tried to 
paint WFP as not being nonpartisan.  In the government 
controlled newspaper, The Herald, Jonathan Moyo, Minister of 
State for Information and Publicity insisted that the WFP was 
being used t further British political interests in Insiza 
and challenged the WFP to assure the country that the British 
are not directing it.  "While we appreciate assistance from 
well-meaning quarters, whether from WFP or anyone else," Moyo 
said, "we are not going to allow it to compromise our 
sovereignty."  The state media, controlled by Moyo, also 
claimed implausibly that ORAP was controlled by MDC activists 
bent on distributing food in a partisan manner. 
 
¶4. (U) The raid on the food distribution depot occurred the 
day after Jonathan Moyo told journalists that the British 
High Commissioner was ordering all NGOs to distribute food to 
MDC supporters ahead of the Insiza by-election but the same 
day the story appeared in the state-run newspaper.  Moyo 
reiterated that the British High Commissioner should desist 
from meddling in Zimbabwe internal affairs.  The British High 
Commission issued a statement on October 17 denying these 
allegations. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The GOZ is appropriately concerned about the WFP 
food suspension and public statements.  WFP Director Kevin 
Farrell and Minister of Social Welfare July Moyo will travel 
to Insiza October 21 to address the issues. 
 
¶6.  (U) ACTION: Post recommends State issue a statement 
expressing outrage and concern about the seizure and partisan 
use of international food aid and we plan to issue a 
statement in Harare as well.  We are sending proposed 
language to the Department separately.  We are also urging 
WFP to insist on return of the food, although we do not 
recommend making this point public as yet.
