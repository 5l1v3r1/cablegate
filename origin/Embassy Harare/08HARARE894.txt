SUBJECT: UNDP HOSTS FORUM ON ZIMBABWEAN RECOVERY 
 
¶1.  (U) The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) hosted 
a forum in Harare on October 1 at which they discussed the 
recently unveiled UNDP Zimbabwean economic recovery plan. 
The research team that produced the 230 page document 
entitled, "Comprehensive Economic Recovery in Zimbabwe" was 
comprised of senior Zimbabwean economists who spent a year 
producing the assessment.  The presentation focused on the 
imperative of restoring macroeconomic stability as a 
pre-condition to economic recovery.  The recommendations 
produced within the report are wide ranging and deal with 
sectoral improvements in the areas of trade policy, public 
enterprises, the financial sector, agriculture, 
manufacturing, mining, tourism, the informal sector, and the 
labor market. 
 
¶2.  (U) The forum also included discussion of how Zimbabwe 
could best manage international assistance if Zimbabwe's 
traditional development partners were willing to reengage 
with and support its recovery efforts.  The entire report is 
available on the UNDP website. 
 
¶3.  (U) The forum was well-attended by a mix of Heads of 
Mission, World Bank officials, international aid 
organizations, and local trade and labor groups.  The 
audience filled the conference room to capacity and engaged 
the team during the question and answer period.  A 
significant portion of this discussion included remedial 
efforts that would be necessary to ease the pain of 
transition from an informal economy back to a formal economy, 
as numerous informal money changers, gasoline peddlers, and 
black market entrepreneurs will be displaced. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) GOZ officials were notably absent from the forum. 
UNDP Chief Technical Advisor, Mark Simpson, told poloff that 
the team had sent copies of the report to four ZANU-PF 
officials who the UNDP had identified as being potentially 
receptive, as well as positioned within economically 
important ministries.  No response had yet been received from 
these officials.  Ian Makone, MDC director of elections and a 
close Tsvangirai advisor, was the only MDC representative 
present.
