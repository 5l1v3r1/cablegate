¶1.  The Ambassador delivered the Demarche (Ref) and talking 
points to Zimbabwe Minister of Environment Frances Nhema on 
January 29. 
 
¶2.  Nhema responded that in principle he had no objections to 
any of the U.S. proposals.  He said that customarily, with 
regard to CITES, the GOZ canvasses the Africa region to see 
if there are countries affected by proposals that have 
positions.  If there are not, the GOZ will in all probability 
support the proposals.
