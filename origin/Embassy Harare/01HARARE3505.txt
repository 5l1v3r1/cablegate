LADEN; HARARE 
 
¶1.   UNDER HEADLINE "OSAMA BIN LADEN, A BRAINCHILD OF CIA," 
   THE NOVEMBER 17 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED 
   DAILY "THE HERALD" LIFTED THE FOLLOWING PROPAGANDA 
   ARTICLE BY RANJIT BHUSHAN FROM THE WORLD PRESS REVIEW 
   (VOL. 48, NO 11): 
 
¶2.   "IRONIC AS IT MAY SOUND, OSAMA BIN LADEN. . . RECEIVED 
   HIS FIRST LESSONS IN THE ART OF CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS 
   AND SUBTERFUGE FROM THE CIA.  REWIND TO THE LATE 1970S. 
   IT WAS AT THE JAWORA BASE NEAR HOST, AFGHANISTAN, THAT 
   ¶U. S. INTELLIGENCE SET UP A TRAINING GROUND TO EQUIP 
   YOUNG MEN TO FIGHT A GUERILLA BATTLE AGAINST THE 
   ERSTWHILE USSR.  BELONGING TO THE ROYAL SAUDI FAMILY, 
   BIN LADEN WAS A VIP STUDENT OF THE CIA. . .  THE ONCE- 
   FAVORED PUPIL OF THE CIA IS THE ONE MAN THE AGENCY NOW 
   BADLY WANTS.  BUT HE HAS PROVED SUPREMELY ELUSIVE.  AND 
   AS THE HUNT TAKES ON A NEW DIMENSION FOLLOWING BLACK 
   TUESDAY, THE CIA CAN DIP INTO ITS OWN RECORDS OF THIS 
   MILLENNIUM'S DR. NO. 1.  THE WORLD'S MOST WANTED MAN NOW 
   LISTS HIS ENEMIES IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE: NO. 1, THE 
   UNITED STATES; NO. 2, ISRAEL; AND NO. 3, INDIA.  IN A 
   CAREER SPANNING OVER TWO DECADES, BIN LADEN HAS TRULY 
   EMERGED THE GLOBAL RELIGIOUS MERCENARY, OPERATING FROM 
   WEST ASIA, AFRICA, AND ASIA, ALL WITH EQUAL EASE AND 
   PRECISION.  THE MOTIVATION AGAINST THE U.S. IS ITS 
   ALLIANCE WITH SAUDI ARABIA DURING THE GULF WAR AND ITS 
   ANTI-PALESTINE POSITION.  ISRAEL IS ON HIS HIT LIST FOR 
   ZIONISM, AND INDIA, FOR KASHMIR. . . ."
