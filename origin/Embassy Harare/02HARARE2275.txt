  ¶1.   Under headline "Blair, Bush terrorism must stop" 
      the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" dedicated 
      its October 12 editorial to ordering the British and 
      American governments to stop meddling in the affairs 
      of other countries.  "We demand that Blair and Bush 
      leave other countries to run their affairs without 
      interference.  All this euphoria to run other nations 
      by remote control should stop," the newspaper 
      directed.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   "There is an adage that says a rolling stone 
      gathers no moss.  This sounds true for people like 
      British Prime Minister Tony Blair who appears to be 
      more obsessed with trying to overthrow foreign 
      governments instead of addressing Britain's problems. 
      . .  Working together with another rabble-rouser 
      American President, George W. Bush and organizations 
      such as the European Union and the Commonwealth, Blair 
      has sought to isolate Zimbabwe, impose covert 
      sanctions on Harare with a view to forcing people to 
      rebel against the Government. . .  Together with Bush, 
      Blair teamed up with rebel groups and ousted the 
      Taliban administration in Afghanistan in an exercise 
      that left a lot of people dead under the guise of 
      fighting international terrorism.  Now they are 
      itching for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein who they 
      also want ousted. . .  It is ironic that Blair 
      believes his crusade to use military force to remove 
      other heads of states and replacing them with puppets 
      is not terrorism.  According to the Concise Oxford 
      Dictionary a terrorist is, `A person who uses or 
      favors violent and intimidating methods of coercing a 
      government or community.'  So the British and the 
      American cousins want to fight what they call 
      terrorism through terrorism?  We demand that Blair and 
      Bush leave other countries to run their affairs 
      without interference.  All this euphoria to run other 
      nations by remote control should 
      stop. . . ."
