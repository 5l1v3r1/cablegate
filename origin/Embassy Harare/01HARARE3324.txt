DEBATE 
 
 
¶1.   ON OCTOBER 31 POST HOSTED A TELEPRESS CONFERENCE TO 
   EXPLORE THE TOPIC "PRESS FREEDOM AND RESPONSIBILITY IN 
   TIMES OF NATIONAL CRISIS: HAVE THE RULES CHANGED SINCE 
   SEPTEMBER 11?"  THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROGRAM WAS TO 
   PROVIDE A PLATFORM TO DISCUSS MEDIA FREEDOM ISSUES AND 
   AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE KEY POINTS ABOUT THE WAR AGAINST 
   TERROR.  FOR THIS PROGRAM WITH JOURNALIST AND MEDIA 
   FREEDOM ADVOCATE ADAM CLAYTON POWELL III, WE HAD AN 
   AUDIENCE OF ABOUT 60 JOURNALISTS JOURNALISM STUDENTS, 
   POLITICAL AND MEDIA COMENTATORS, REPRESENTATIVES OF 
   MEDIA AND CIVIC RGANIZATIONS, AND GOVERNMENT-OFFICIALS 
   FROM THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY. AMONG 
   THE PARTICIPANTS WAS MR. JEALOUS MAWARIRE, A JUNIOR 
   REPORTER WITH THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED WEEKLY "THE 
   SUNDAY MAIL."   THAT PAPER'S NOVEMBER 4 EDITION CARRIED 
   AN OPINION PIECE BY MAWARIRE.  EXCERPTS FOLLOW. 
 
¶2.   ".THE MOVE THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN BY THE UNITED STATES 
   GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL THE OPERATIONS OF THE MEDIA IN 
   AMERICA, OSTENSIBLY ON THE PRETEXT THAT INFORMATION FLOW 
   IN THIS TIME OF NATIONAL CRISIS IS NECESSARY, IS 
   REGRETTABLE. . .  ADAM CLAYTON POWELL III. . .TOLD 
   PARTICIPANTS THROUGH THE TELEPHONE THAT HIS GOVERNMENT 
   HAD MOVED IN TO CURTAIL MEDIA FREEDOM AS A MOVE TOWARDS 
   BEEFING UP SECURITY MEASURES. . .  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT 
   HAS TAKEN IT UPON ITSELF TO DESCEND UPON THE FREEDOM OF 
   ITS CITIZENS TO FREELY EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND IF WE ARE 
   MADE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS FREEDOM OF THE MEDIA IN 
   AMERICA WE MIGHT AS WELL BE TOLD THAT SATAN IS GOD'S 
   BEST FRIEND." 
 
¶3.   COMMENT:  MR. POWELL NEVER SAID THAT THE USG HAS 
   "MOVED IN TO CURTAIL MEDIA FREEDOM" OR ANYTHING ALONG THOSE 
   LINES.  WE DID DISCUSS THE DEBATE OVER WHETHER OR NOT US 
   NETWORKS WERE RIGHT TO SHOW THE BIN LADEN STATEMENT, AND 
   OVER THE VOA'S BROADCAST OF THE MULLAH OMAR INTERVIEW, BUT 
   THE POINT OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS WAS PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE 
   OF MR. MAWARIRE'S THESIS.  WE ARE DRAFTING A LETTER TO THE 
   EDITOR OF THE SUNDAY MAIL TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.
