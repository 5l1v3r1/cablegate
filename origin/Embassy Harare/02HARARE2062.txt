  ¶1.   Under headline "Who will pre-empt the war on Iraq?" 
      the independent, pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" 
      dedicated its September 8 editorial to urging the United 
      Nations Security Council to stop the United States and 
      Britain from attacking Iraq.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   "The first salvos of the unfolding war against Iraq 
      have already been fired.  The U.S. and its key ally, the 
      UK, are meeting this weekend, in the context of a `Council 
      of War' (to use their own words), almost as a confirmation 
      that war can no longer be stopped.  And with the 
      anniversary of the September 11 due this week, war fever 
      has almost engulfed the U.S.  We have no doubt that other 
      members of the 
      UN Security Council will deny Bush and Blair the nod 
      they are seeking as a formality for war plans 
      already concluded.  It will be yet another test for 
      the world body, a commendable outcome, of at least 
      Russia, China and France can stand up and be 
      counted, even if, as appears to be the case, the 
      U.S. and the UK should persist with their war plans. 
      [NB: This is an accurate transcription.] 
 
      "If Bush and Blair should go it alone, the emptiness 
      of their cause will become even more obvious and 
      their penchant for bullying thereby exposed.  But it 
      might not be too late to stop this senseless war, 
      provided that all sections of our Earth speak out 
      and demand that Kofi Annan calls an urgent meeting 
      of the UN Security Council.  The Arab World has 
      already stated its strong opposition to any attack 
      on Iraq and, in so doing, has exposed the hawk that 
      is Israel that alone in the Middle East is in favor 
      of war.  Africa and the Third World need to add 
      their voice.  It is not too late to clinch a 
      diplomatic solution over Iraq and place the matter 
      entirely within the ambit of the United Nations."
