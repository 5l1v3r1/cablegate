SUBJECT: FORMER IV GRANTEE BECOMES PUBLISHER 
 
¶1.   IV alumnus Mark Chavhunduka (Multi-regional 
   project on print journalism, May 1992) has, at 36, 
   become Zimbabwe's youngest publisher. 
 
¶2.   Chavhunduka, who until this month was editor of 
   the independent weekly "The Standard," has assumed 
   control of Thompson Publications.  Thompson publishes 
   several magazines, including the country's largest 
   circulating monthly magazine "Parade." 
 
¶3.   Chavhunduka's control of Thompson will strengthen 
   the private media in Zimbabwe.  His commitment to 
   freedom of the media is well known.  In spite of having 
   been detained and tortured by the Zimbabwean military 
   in January 1999 (after his newspaper published a report 
   alleging an attempted coup within the military), 
   Chavhunduka remained as editor of the Standard and 
   continued to publish articles and opinion pieces 
   critical of the Government of Zimbabwe. 
 
¶4.   Chavhunduka has told us that the IV program, which 
   brought him into regular contact with Embassy Harare 
   and media organizations in the U.S., strengthened his 
   abilities as a journalist and helped sustain him 
   through the pressures he has faced.
