Mr. Barack Obama 
President of the United States of America 
 
Mr. President, 
 
I have the honour to extend to you my sincere appreciation for the 
warm reception accorded to me and my delegation during my recent 
visit to your country. 
 
I also wish to acknowledge the fruitful exchange of views in various 
matters that concern our two countries.  I have no doubt that you 
share my commitment to rebuilding relations between our two 
countries. 
 
Mr. President, I deeply appreciate your expressions of support to 
the process of deepening the democratic system, strengthening our 
political system and economic reforms that my country has embarked 
on.  I can assure you that we in the Inclusive Government are 
determined to succeed in charting a new, prosperous and stable 
future for our country. 
 
I wish to also extend to you, Mr. President, Zimbabwe's appreciation 
for the humanitarian aid and other support from your country over 
the years.  I reaffirm my view that Zimbabwe has great potential to 
ove from aid dependency. 
 
I also benefited immensely from the interactions I had with 
Secretary of State, Mrs. Hillary Clinton, Members of Congress as 
well as officials of the Institutes and Foundations that we were 
able to meet during our stay in your great Country. 
 
I am looking forward to regular high-level visits between our two 
countries. 
 
Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
/s/ 
Morgan R. Tsvangirai 
Prime Minister of the Republic of Zimbabwe
