  ¶1.   Under headline "Genocide in Palestine" the ZANU 
      PF weekly organ "The People's Voice" dedicated its 
      September 29 editorial to accusing the Israeli Prime 
      Minister Ariel Sharon of "committing genocide" against 
      the Palestinian people.  The editorial also denounced 
      President Bush for "sheltering such a murderous and 
      genocidal regime." Excerpts follow: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . . The Israeli Army has occupied all the 
      towns in the Palestinian territory, demolished 
      Arafat's office bloc in Ramallah, and is continuously 
      and systematically demolishing dwelling houses and 
      killing people living in them, including women and 
      children.  Mr. Sharon and his army are obviously 
      committing genocide. 
 
      "The only reason why Mr. Sharon is not at The 
      Hague's International Tribunal to answer charges 
      of genocide is the support he has from President 
      George Bush of the USA and his Government.  It 
      is surprising that a President who is so 
      committed to fighting terrorism, and to promote 
      good governance in the world should be 
      sheltering such a murderous and genocidal 
      regime.  It is now the time for all the members 
      of the United Nations, and all the six regions 
      of the world, to speak out loudly and clearly 
      against both Mr. Sharon and his supporter, Mr. 
      Bush.  All the statements against terrorism lose 
      credibility if the worst example of terrorist 
      (Sharon) remains behind the American umbrella."
