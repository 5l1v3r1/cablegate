SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In the face of ongoing SADC-sponsored negotiations, 
the GOZ continues to use violence to stifle free expression. 
At 9:00 am this morning, several civil society groups led two 
different protests of hundreds of people to the area outside 
Rainbow Towers, the hotel where the negotiations were to 
begin later in the morning, only to be greeted by police who 
arrested and beat women and students and used tear gas to 
break up their protests.  Simultaneously in Bulawayo, leaders 
of Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) were denied bail following 
their arrest during a protest there on October 16.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Women Arrested While Praying for Zimbabwe 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On the morning of October 27, about 100 women -- 
wearing black and white to represent suffering and peace -- 
began to gather outside Rainbow Towers, the downtown Harare 
hotel that has been home to the negotiations.  Approximately 
800 women from a dozen civil society organizations including 
WOZA, Women's Alliance, the Combined Harare Residents' 
Association (CHRA), the Progressive Teachers' Union of 
Zimbabwe (PTUZ), the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions 
(ZCTU), and the General Agriculture and Plantation Workers of 
Zimbabwe (GAPWUZ) planned to present a petition to the SADC 
Troika at Rainbow Towers.  Their message was "Finish the 
talks, we are dying of hunger".  When the first group of 
women arrived, police denied them access to the Rainbow 
Towers compound, and they retreated to a nearby field facing 
the building where they began to pray while waiting for the 
rest of the women to arrive.  Shortly after they moved to the 
nearby field, police dispersed the group with tear gas and 
beat them with batons.  They arrested at least 42 women. 
Witnesses reported police beat passersby who were 
coincidentally Qaring black or white.  Counseling Services 
Unit, a local NGO that treats victims of political violence, 
estimates that about 20 women have sought medical attention 
for their injuries.  Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) 
dispatched five lawyers to Harare Central police station, 
where, seven hours later, police continue to deny them access 
to the arrested women.

Student March Met With Tear Gas 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Simultaneously, Youth Agenda Trust led a 
demonstration of about 200 students from Youth Forum, Student 
Christian Movement of Zimbabwe, and Zimbabwe National 
Students Union (ZINASU) down one of Harare's main streets 
towards Rainbow Towers. The students planned to present the 
SADC Troika with a petition calling for a logical and 
balanced power-sharing agreement and highlight the need for 
SADC and the AU to pressure Mugabe to share power equitably 
with Morgan Tsvangirai.  The students handed out a half-page 
flyer detailing their demands for a political solution. 
While police initially let the students march peacefully, 
riot police then fired tear gas grenades and beat up some of 
the protesters as well as others who happened to be in the 
busy downtown area.  Riot police also had a water canon truck

on standby.  ZLHR is looking for three students who were 
reportedly arrested, but has not yet been able to locate them.

After 12 Days in Jail, WOZA Leaders Denied Bail 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Also on the morning of October 27, Bulawayo 
magistrate Charity Maphosa denied bail to Jenni Williams and 
Magodonga Mahlangu, leaders of Women of Zimbabwe Arise 
(WOZA), in connection with their arrest on October 16.  The 
two were arrested when they led a protest of about 200 women 
to the Mhlahlandlela Government Complex in Bulawayo to demand 
food aid and declaration of a national emergency.  Williams 
and Mahlangu appeared in court on October 17, facing charges 
of disturbing the peace.  Immediately before the initial 
hearing, the state prosecutor and defense lawyer, Kossam 
Ncube, set conditions and the amount of bail; the state 
prosecutor said he would not oppose bail. However, when the 
hearing started, a new prosecutor appeared and took over the 
case. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  The state prosecutor proceeded to claim that the 
two should be denied bail because of an outstanding case 
pending against them, referring to a case that was removed 
from remand in a Harare magistrate's court on October 15.  In 
that case, the magistrate told the state to come to court on 
October 15 prepared to try 14 WOZA members in connection with 
their May 28 arrest (reftels).  When the prosecutor appeared 
unprepared, the magistrate removed the case from remand. 
(NOTE: Removing a case from remand means it is no longer 
pending, although the state has not officially dropped the 
charges.  END NOTE.)  In the October 17 hearing, the state 
argued that Williams and Mahlangu should be denied bail 
because their May 28 case was still pending.  The magistrate 
allowed the state prosecutor until October 21 to verify the 
status of the May 28 case. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  In court on October 21, the state argued that the 
two should be denied bail because of four different cases 
against them dating back to 2004.  The state called a police 
detective, Sergeant Ncube, who testified that, in one of the 
long-pending cases, he could not present Williams and 
Mahlangu with a summons because he could never find them at 
their stated addresses.  The state went on to argue that the 
two had committed similar offenses and were likely to do so 
again.  The prosecutor argued that the magistrate should 
ignore the fact that their arrests had been for crimes that 
were not serious.  He also said that in a 2007 arrest, 
Williams and  Mahlangu had lied when asked if they had any 
cases pending against them. (NOTE: The "pending" cases had 
been removed from remand, which legally means they are no 
longer pending.  END NOTE.)  The magistrate decided to 
reserve judgment until October 24.  On October 24, however, 
the magistrate was unavailable and reported she was "forced" 
to attend a workshop and could not deliver the verdict. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  After spending 11 days in jail, the magistrate 
denied the two women bail on October 27, claiming the two had 
two cases pending against them, making it likely they would 
commit similar offenses again.  She also noted that the 
political climate in Zimbabwe means that "people are easily 
excitable" and could be moved to violence if they saw a 
demonstration.  The defense will lodge an appeal to the High 
Court.

HARARE 00000966  003 OF 003 
 
 
 
¶8. (SBU) While the SADC Troika and Zimbabwe's politicians 
meet, the Zimbabwean people are growing increasingly 
impatient with the continued impasse.  The beatings, arrests, 
and denial of bail in clear contravention of the principles 
set out in the September 15 agreement indicate business as 
usual and lack of good faith on the part of ZANU-PF/GOZ. 
Rule of law and respect for human rights and the provisions 
of the September 15 agreement remain elusive in Zimbabwe. 
END COMMENT.
