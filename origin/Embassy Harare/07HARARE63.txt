¶1. Embassy Harare grants country clearance and warmly 
welcomes the visit of Timothy Trenkle and Robert Pope for the 
purpose of attending the IOM Reception and Support Centre 
during the day of January 30.  Post recognizes that travelers 
do not need Embassy assistance. 
 
¶2. Based on the current economic situation in the country, 
using a credit card could significantly increase your 
costs.  Hotel payment must be made in U.S. cash or 
travelers checks.  U.S. travelers checks are difficult to 
use except to pay hotel bills.  Personal checks may be 
cashed at the Embassy cashier only for local currency and 
at the official exchange rate.  Personal checks cannot be 
cashed at the Embassy for U.S. currency.  Post recommends 
that travelers bring enough U.S. currency to cover 
anticipated needs in Zimbabwe. 
 
¶3. Post strongly urges leaving Embassy Harare's telephone 
number with family and business associates before departing 
for Zimbabwe so that you can be quickly located in the 
event of an emergency.  The Embassy telephone number is 
263-4-250-593.  Marine Security Guard Post extension is 
¶260. 
 
¶4. Several recent visitors transiting Johannesburg to 
Harare have had items stolen from their luggage at 
Johannesburg International Airport.  Please ensure that 
your luggage is locked and hand-carry valuable items. 
 
¶5. Malaria is prevalent throughout Zimbabwe, except in 
Harare.  We strongly recommend the use of malaria 
prophylaxes and adjunctive measures when traveling outside 
of Harare. 
 
¶6. The exchange rate is currently 2815.00, however this 
rate is subject to frequent change. 
 
¶7. Road safety/automobile travel: While traveling in 
vehicles, doors should be kept locked and windows rolled 
up.  Car-jackings are common in Harare, and diplomatic 
vehicles and personnel are not immune to these attacks by 
armed thieves.  Highway bandits are active on roads leading 
to border areas.
