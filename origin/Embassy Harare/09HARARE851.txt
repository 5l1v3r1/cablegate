¶2. Tsvangirai Lobbies Key SADC Members...After "disengaging" from 
ZANU-PF, PM Morgan Tsvangirai this week met with South African 
President Jacob Zuma, Mozambican President Armando Guebuzza, 
Congolese President Joseph Kabila, and planned to meet with 
President Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola on Friday.  The whirlwind 
tour is an effort to lobby SADC to to pressure President Robert 
Mugabe and SADC to comply with the Global Political Agreement. 
Specifically, the MDC wants Mugabe to appoint MDC governors, rescind 
the appointments of RBZ governor Gideon Gono and Attorney General 
Johannes Tomana, and to swear in Roy Bennett as Deputy Minister of 
Agriculture.  Tsvangirai is expected to return to Harare today and 
to meet with Mugabe on Monday.  The SADC Troika heads of state, as 
well as well as a representative of South Africa, the GPA 
facilitator, will meet with principals (Mugabe, Tsvangirai, and 
Arthur Mutambara) and GPA negotiators on October 29 in Harare.  See 
Harare 843. 
 
¶3. As Mugabe Holds Cabinet Meeting in his Absence...  On October 20, 
President Robert Mugabe chaired a cabinet meeting attended by his 
party and MDC-M ministers.  MDC boycotted and held its own "cabinet" 
meeting at MDC-T party headquarters. 
 
¶4. Rural Residents Fear Renewed Violence...  Post conducted site 
visits to rural communities across five different provinces and 
determined that though current levels of non-farm related political 
violence are low, residents still live in fear of ZANU-PF directed 
violence.  That fear stems from concerns that ZANU-PF has maintained 
its capacity to deliver a campaign of violence through ZANU-PF 
youth, war veterans and the military.  Elements of these 
organizations continue to circulate in rural communities, and in 
some instances have increased their activities.  See Harare 839. 
Government officials have told us that as many as 25,000 youths are 
on the payroll without specific jobs; many are engaged in 
intimidation of MDC supporters. 
 
¶5. Cholera Season Begins in Zimbabwe...  According to the World 
Health Organization, as of October 17, 2009, 72 cases of cholera and 
3 deaths have been verified nationwide.  About half of the cases are 
in Chipinge District in Manicaland province, but there are also a 
few cases in Harare (5 cases from Mabvuku), Midlands (19), 
Mashonaland Central (1), and Mashonaland West (18).  The cholera 
season in Zimbabwe runs roughly from October to April, and more 
cases are expected once the seasonal rains begin in late November or 
Qcases are expected once the seasonal rains begin in late November or 
December.  The incidence to date is not above the norm and is not 
expected to be as high as last year because of the intensity with 
which the donor community has supported hygiene education. 
 
¶6. AG Tomana Takes Over Bennett's Case...  On October 19, Attorney 
General Johannes Tomana personally took over prosecution of Roy 
Bennett from the two senior officers who had been handling the case.

Tomana, who has made no secret of his ZANU-PF partisanship, 
defended the move by saying Bennett was a "national security threat" 
and that he had intervened to expedite the trial.  Bennett's trial 
on banditry, sabotage and terrorism charges is expected to begin in 
Harare's High Court on November 9.  In the meantime, he remains out 
on bail.

On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Manufacturing Sector Improving but Problems Remain...  According 
to the 2009 manufacturing sector survey, firms have started to 
increase capacity utilization from around 10 percent in the first 
six months of 2007 to over 30 percent during the corresponding 
period of 2009.  However, constraints such as a shortage of imported 
inputs, lack of credit, and high production costs continue to limit 
the pace of recovery.  Although most firms recorded increases in 
output, only 9.5 percent of respondents were optimistic about the 
future. 
 
¶8. Companies Consolidate as Cash Crunch Bites...  Cash-rich beverage 
manufacturer, DELTA Corporation, is increasing its stake in wines 
and spirits producer, African Distillers, from about 30 percent to 
just over 50 percent.  According to an October 22 report in the 
Financial Gazette, the move is part of Delta's strategy to 
reconfigure its strategic model and concentrate on its core 
business.  Separately, Kingdom Meikles subsidiary Cotton Printers 
filed for voluntary liquidation due to bankruptcy brought about by 
insufficient capitalization.  This follows hard on the heels of a 
similar move by Zimbabwean textile manufacturer, David Whitehead. 
 
¶9. Biti's Budget Woes... Finance Minister Tendai Biti briefed 
diplomats this week and said revenue was still flat at about $90 
million per month.  While this is about 20 times more than the 
Ministry of Finance was taking in at the beginning of the year, it 
still falls far short of what Biti thinks the GOZ should be 
spending.  For instance, Biti would like to raise monthly 
civil-service wages from $155 to $200, but this would eat up two 
thirds of the budget.  Under the tight constraints of his cash 
budget, Biti has reluctantly agreed to use $200 million of 
Zimbabwe's new allocation of IMF special drawing rights to fund 
infrastructure projects, renovation of public utilities, and lines 
of credit for the private sector.  A further $140 million in SDRs 
would be set aside to clear Zimbabwe's arrears with the IMF.

Quote of the Week

¶10. "If this Global Political Agreement is to collapse I would say 
to Robert Mugabe, you are not the President of Zimbabwe. You are an 
illegitimate leader."  Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara 
(MDC-M), quoted in The Zimbabwe Times on October 20.
