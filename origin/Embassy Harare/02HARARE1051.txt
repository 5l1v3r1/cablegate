SUBJECT: "JOY TV" SUSPENDS BBC NEWS BROADCASTS 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSISIFED.  NOT FOR INTERNET POSTING. 
 
¶1.   (U) Joy Television, a nominally independent 
   Zimbabwean television broadcaster, has suspended BBC 
   News programming with immediate effect.  Since its 
   launch in July 1997, the station has broadcast a BBC 
   World TV news summary at 2000 each day.  Joy TV offered 
   no explanation for dropping the BBC news. 
 
¶2.   (U) Joy TV operates on a frequency leased from the 
   Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) and uses ZBC 
   facilities for its few productions.  For the most part, 
   Joy TV offers its viewers (limited to the Harare area) 
   American sitcoms, action and talk shows.  As part of 
   its licensing agreement with the Government of 
   Zimbabwe, Joy TV does not produce its own news 
   programming.  It has, on occasion, produced talk shows. 
   Joy TV's most recent talk show series disappeared 
   shortly after MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai appeared as 
   the featured guest just before the presidential 
   election. 
 
¶3.   (SBU) Comment:  Joy TV's license expires on May 
   31, 2002.  The Government of Zimbabwe has indicated 
   that it will not renew the license.  Joy TV management, 
   however, maintains that it will find an accommodation 
   with the government in order to stay on the air.  Given 
   the Government of Zimbabwe's hatred of the BBC, we 
   suspect that Joy TV's sudden cancellation of BBC news 
   is part of that "accommodation."
