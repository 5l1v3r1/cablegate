SUBJECT: "DAILY NEWS" COMMISSIONS NEW PRINTING PRESS 
 
 
¶1.   Twenty months after its presses were destroyed by 
    expertly placed, sophisticated explosive devices (no 
    arrests were ever made) the independent "Daily News" 
    inaugurated new presses.  In an October 22 ceremony 
    attended by Zimbabwean media, human rights, law and 
    business leaders, "Daily News" senior management 
    thanked its supporters and spoke of the challenges the 
    paper has overcome and still faces.  The planned 
    highlight of the evening, pushing the button to start 
    printing the next day's edition, did not take place 
    because a strike by "Daily News" workers delayed the 
    paper's production. 
 
¶2.   The perseverance of "Daily News" management and 
    staff after the bombing is a remarkable story. 
    Printing, collating (often by hand) and distributing 
    the paper since the January 28, 2001 destruction of 
    the original presses required daily creativity and 
    chutzpah.  Remarkably, the "Daily News" never missed a 
    day, although late delivery and poor print quality 
    were chronic problems.  The new press, surrounded by 
    impressive looking security walls, lights and cameras, 
    is capable of quick and high-quality production.  One 
    of the challenges for the "Daily News" now is to find 
    additional business for the press so that it will 
    produce revenue during the 20 hours per day when it is 
    not printing the newspaper. 
 
¶3.   The "Daily News" also faces a continuing problem 
    with distribution.  Ruling party supporters, including 
    the so-called "war vets," have banned the paper in 
    most small towns and extensive parts of rural 
    Zimbabwe.  Copies of the newspaper are seized and 
    burned in places like Rusape, Mutoko and Murewa.  The 
    "Daily News" aims to be a national newspaper, and has 
    the editorial and production capacity to do so, but 
    only if Zimbabwe's rulers relax their prohibition on 
    the independent media outside of the country's main 
    cities and larger towns.
