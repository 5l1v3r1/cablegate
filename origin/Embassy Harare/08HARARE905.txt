----------------------------- 
On the Political/Social Front 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Negotiations Stalled over Ministries... MDC and ZANU-PF continue 
to disagree on the division of ministries, with finance, home 
affairs, local government, and foreign affairs still outstanding. 
The principal sticking point appears to be home affairs.  ZANU-PF is 
concerned that MDC leadership of home affairs could result in 
investigations and prosecutions of ZANU-PF officials for corruption 
and other misdeeds.  Mugabe and Tsvangirai met briefly after Mugabe 
returned from New York on Monday; the two were unable to overcome 
the impasse.  The MDC appealed to SADC to become re-involved in 
mediation and the new South African government has given former 
president Mbeki its support to continue as mediator. See Harare 889, 
890, and 895. 
 
¶4.  Food Situation Bleak... National assessments show this year's 
maize yield is the lowest on record and the sorghum yield was only 
60 percent of last year's.  In addition, there is a critical 
shortage of seeds and fertilizer.  It is already too late to 
procure, ship, and distribute these inputs that are needed by the 
end of October for planting with the first rains. 
 
¶5.  Tsvangirai and UNDP Discuss Plans... This week, UNDP unveiled a 
230-page economic recovery plan to diplomats and World Bank 
officials.  This came after Tsvangirai shared his priorities with 
members of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund on September 26.  Separately, 
Tsvangirai discussed his 100-day plan, which has not yet gone 
public.  See Harare 894 and 895. 
 
¶6.  Will State Universities Open?... After initially delaying 
classes indefinitely, UZ now says classes will start on October 6. 
 
HARARE 00000905  002 OF 003 
 
 
However, there is no agreement with lecturers on pay, only parts of 
the campus have water, and power outages are routine.  At the 
National University of Science and Technology in Bulawayo the Vice 
Chancellor told us they did not have enough money to start classes. 
The only universities operating normally are three private schools. 
This is just the latest blow to Zimbabwe's once highly-regarded 
education system. 
 
¶7.  Global Fund Audit Begins... This week the Global Fund's Office 
of the Inspector General began a three-week audit mission to 
evaluate the operations of the Principal Recipients and their 
interactions with the Country Coordinating Mechanism, Local Fund 
Agent, Fund Manager, and the Sub-Recipients.  Approximately $6 
million of Global Fund resources have been tied up in the Reserve 
Bank of Zimbabwe since November 2007. 
 
¶8.  Tsvangirai Still Without Passport... More than three months 
after filing an application, Tsvangirai continues to wait for a new 
passport. Subsequent to the power-sharing agreement, he applied for 
a diplomatic passport.  In recent months, he traveled in the region 
using two separate emergency travel documents with unusually short 
validity.  Reportedly, the responsible office claimed it ran out of 
materials to produce passports, but senior officials working there 
said hundreds of passports have been issued in recent months.  In 
2004, Olympic swimmer Kirsty Coventry was given a diplomatic 
passport after winning three medals in Athens. 
 
¶9.  Former Soccer Star in Barracks... Masimba Dinyero, Zimbabwe's 
best footballer at the pinnacle of his soccer career in 1989, was 
ordered to police barracks for three weeks.  During a casual 
discussion with fellow policemen, Dinyero allegedly criticized 
President Mugabe for continuing to cling to power while police 
officers starve. 
 
---------------------------------- 
On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  Bank Transfers Suspended...  In an apparent belief that 
skyrocketing prices are based on the galloping foreign exchange rate 
for inter-bank transfers, the RBZ suspended inter-bank transfers 
with effect from October 3, 2008.  The suspension is likely to 
result in a logjam in Zimbabwe's payment system as cash is also not 
readily available. 
 
¶11.  New Bank Notes Issued...  With mind boggling inflation and 
growing public disgruntlement over the inability of the Reserve Bank 
to supply the market with enough cash, the Reserve Bank introduced 
new Z$10,000 and Z$20,000 bank notes on Monday to match the new 
withdrawal limit of Z$20,000 (roughly US$4 at the street rate).  The 
paper quality and level of security features, especially on the 
larger note, are poor as the RBZ scrambles to replace high-quality 
secure paper from Germany.  Bank lines were in the thousands on 
Monday and Tuesday as Zimbabweans waited to withdraw their cash and 
police maintained order.  Despite some scuffles, most bank lines 
were calm and orderly.  By week's end, the lines were returning to 
"normal." 
 
¶12.  Food Inflation - A Trillion Percent...  As we observe prices 
from bus fare to food rising in the course of a single day, one 
private sector report put the year-on-year rate of flood inflation 
in September at 1.1 trillion percent and the month-on-month rate at 
26,385%.  A new hyperinflation index developed by Prof. Steve Hanke 
of The Johns Hopkins University puts the current rate of inflation 
at 531 billion percent.  See www.cato.org/zimbabwe 
 
¶13.  Air Zimbabwe Charges Business Fares In Forex...  In yet another 
move toward dollarization, AirZim announced that it would charge 
 
HARARE 00000905  003 OF 003 
 
 
business class fares in foreign currency to raise funds for spares 
and fuel, as 90% of the company's operational expenses are in 
foreign exchange.  Air Zimbabwe introduced fares in forex a half 
year ago, only to be forced to revert to local currency soon after. 
 
¶14.  RBZ Issues 570 Foreign Exchange Licenses to Shops...  Removing 
the main stumbling block to the opening of foreign exchange shops, 
the RBZ is allowing licensees 90 days to pay the US$20,000 license 
fee.  The first supermarkets in upscale Harare neighborhoods shifted 
to mostly forex-priced goods this week. 
 
¶15.  Exporters' Forex Retention Rate Increased... Typical of RBZ 
Governor Gono's policy pendulum swings, he raised to 75% the foreign 
exchange that exporters are allowed to retain, effective September 
1, after having lowered it to 55% on August 1.  The Confederation of 
Zimbabwe Industries welcomed the move, stating that it was long 
overdue. 
 
¶16.  Timber Company Hit by Labor Shortage...  An acute shortage of 
labor vexed Border Timbers Ltd in the year ending June 30, 2008, as 
the Mutare-based company bled labor to illegal gold panning and 
diamond digging.  Frequent power outages also plagued the company 
and illegal settlers continued to set timber plantations on fire to 
clear land to grow maize.  Exports improved somewhat, but the 
overvalued exchange rate will likely erode profitability. 
 
¶17.  Plummeting Production in Cement and Gold Industries... 
Domestic production of cement fell 26% in the first half of 2008 and 
export volume declined 56% at Lafarge Cement due to power cuts and 
shortages of spares and key raw materials.  Gold production at 
Falcon Gold fell 71% in the nine months to end-June 2008.

Quotes of the Week 
------------------ 
 
¶18.  MDC Spokesman Nelson Chamisa on the current impasse in talks: 
"We want to share power. But Mugabe wants to swallow the MDC. We 
will not allow that. He wants all the key ministries - finance, home 
affairs, defense, information, foreign affairs, justice and even 
women and youth."  The Guardian, Tuesday October 30. 
 
 
¶19.  Robert Mugabe on the talks:  "We had to have these talks 
because when we went to vote in March, some of you remained in bed 
instead of going out to vote. Some of you voted wrongly."  Harare 
Tribune, Monday September 29.
