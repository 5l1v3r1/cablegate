Sensitive but unclassified.  Protect accordingly. 
 
(SBU) Posts reaffirms Zimbabwe's present unsuitability 
for Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade 
preferences.  The country has regressed in its protection 
of private property, respect for rule of law, tolerance 
of political pluralism, elimination of price controls, as 
well as in numerous other AGOA provisions.
