ZIMBABWEAN SECURITY CHIEFS 
 
REF:  HARARE 104 
 
FOLLOWING IS THE FULL TRANSCRIPT OF THE JANUARY 9 PRESS 
BRIEF BY ZIMBABWEAN SECURITY CHIEFS, DELIVERED BY ZDF FORCE 
COMMANDER VITALIS ZVINAVASHE. 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
¶1. OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED INCREASE 
IN SPECULATIVE, IMAGINARY AND FALSE ARTICLES BY THE SO- 
CALLED INDEPENDENT MEDIA BOTH INTERNALLY AND 
INTERNATIONALLY, ON THE STATUS AND OPERATIONS OF THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS.  THESE STATEMENTS HAVE 
CAUSED INSECURITY, UNCERTAINTY, CONFUSION AND HAVE IN THE 
MAIN TARNISHED THE CREDIBILITY OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY ARMS 
OF THE STATE OF ZIMBABWE. 
 
¶2. ALL THESE MACHINATIONS HAVE PROMPTED THE CONVENING OF 
THIS PRESS BRIEF TO ARTICULATE THE POSITION OF THE SECURITY 
FORCES WHOSE CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IS THE DEFENSE OF ZIMBABWE 
AND ITS INTERESTS. 
 
¶3. ZIMBABWEANS FOUGHT A BITTER AND PROTRACTED STRUGGLE TO 
LIBERATE THEMSELVES FROM IMPERIALISM, COLONIALISM, 
SETTLERISM AND ALL FORMS OF NEO-COLONIALISM.  THE OBJECTIVE 
OF THIS BITTER STRUGGLE WAS TO ATTAIN POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, 
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY.  THIS 
WOULD ENSURE THAT ZIMBABWEANS RESTORE THEIR DIGNITY, 
RESPECT, FREEDOM AND SECURITY LONG DENIED THEM BY THEIR 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  00107  01 OF 03  101512Z 
SETTLER COLONIZERS.  IN THE PROCESS OF STRIVING TO ACHIEVE 
THESE VALUES, OVER 50,000 ZIMBABWEANS PERISHED, THOUSANDS 
WERE JAILED, MAIMED AND MANY MORE LEFT HOMELESS AND WITHOUT 
PARENTS OR CHILDREN DURING THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE. 
 
¶4. TO SAFEGUARD OUR HISTORY, INDEPENDENCE, SOVEREIGNTY, 
TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL HERITAGE AND 
ZIMBABWE'S DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INTERESTS, THE 
SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS COMPRISING THE ZNA, AFZ, POLICE, CIO 
AND THE PRISON SERVICE WERE ESTABLISHED AS PROVIDED FOR IN 
THE CONSTITUTION OF ZIMBABWE.  THIS CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION 
IS NOT ONLY APPLICABLE TO ZIMBABWE BUT IS UNIVERSALLY 
ACCEPTED AND PRACTICED. 
 
¶5. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE 
SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS IS TO ENSURE THAT OUR HARD-WON 
INDEPENDENCE, SOVEREIGNTY, NATIONAL HERITAGE, DIGNITY, 
CULTURE, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INTERESTS ARE PROTECTED AT ALL 
COSTS.  FORTUNATELY FOR ZIMBABWEANS, THE SECURITY 
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE A LEADERSHIP THAT WAS PART OF THE BITTER 
STRUGGLE FOR LIBERATION.  THIS STRUGGLE DEVELOPED POLITICAL 
CADIES WHO HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF ZIMBABWE'S HISTORY, 
VALUES AND DESTINY.  HIGH TRAINING STANDARDS AND IRON-CLAD 
DISCIPLINE HAS CREATED HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL ARMS OF SECURITY 
WHICH HAVE GENERATED A SENSE OF SECURITY AND TRUST AT HOME, 
AND HIGH REGARD INTERNATIONALLY. 
 
¶6. ANY NATION, AND ZIMBABWE IS NO EXCEPTION, HAS SECURITY 
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE GOVERNED BY LAWS, RULES AND 
REGULATIONS DEFINED BY THE CONSTITUTION TO STREAMLINE AND 
ENHANCE THEIR OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES.  THESE SYSTEMS ARE NOT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  00107  01 OF 03  101512Z 
ESTABLISHED BY INDIVIDUALS OR INCUMBENTS HOLDING EXISTING 
POSTS BUT ARE MEANT TO SERVE SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS.  SO 
ZIMBABWEANS SHOULD KNOW THAT THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE AT THE 
MOMENT ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR THE 
CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS OF ZIMBABWEANS. 
 
¶7. THERE IS THEREFORE NEED FOR ZIMBABWEANS TO RESPECT THESE 
CONSTITUTIONALLY ESTABLISHED SYSTEMS BECAUSE FAILURE TO DO 
SO WOULD RESULT IN INSTABILITY, LAWLESSNESS AND ULTIMATELY, 
ANARCHY.  THE IMPACT OF MALICIOUS DISRESPECT AND GENERALIZED 
MALIGNING OF SECURITY ARMS OF THE STATE IS THAT SOCIETY 
LOSES CONFIDENCE IN THE SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT THEREBY 
UNDERMINING THE SECURITY OF THE NATION. 
 
¶8. GIVEN THAT THE ZIMBABWEAN SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE 
LEARNT A LOT OF LESSONS FROM SITUATIONS OF ANARCHY 
REGIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY: FOR EXAMPLE IN SOMALIA, 
RWANDA, ANGOLA, SIERRA LEONE, KOSOVO, EAST TIMOR AND DRC, 
THEY NATURALLY, CANNOT ALLOW SUCH SITUATION TO DEVELOP IN 
ZIMBABWE.  OUR RECORD IN CONTRIBUTING TO PEACE IN NEARLY ALL 
THESE COUNTRIES BEARS TESTIMONY TO OUR CAPABILITIES.  ALL 
THIS CLEARLY AND IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS DEFINE THE HISTORY OF 
ZIMBABWE AND ITS PEOPLE, FOR A PEOPLE WITHOUT A HISTORY ARE 
A PEOPLE WITHOUT A DESTINY.  EQUALLY, A PEOPLE WITHOUT

ZIMBABWEAN SECURITY CHIEFS 
 
PEACE, LAW AND ORDER CANNOT DEVELOP. 
 
¶9. WHILE IT IS THE ROLE OF THE MEDIA TO INFORM AND EDUCATE 
THE PUBLIC, THERE IS NEED FOR THE MEDIA TO UNDERSTAND THE 
FOLLOWING WITH REGARDS TO SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS: 
 
  ¶A.   THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POLITICAL AND 
     SECURITY SYSTEMS.  IT THEREFORE FOLLOWS THAT IN THE PROCESS 
     OF PROVIDING INFORMATION, THE MEDIA MUST SEPARATE THE TWO. 
 
  ¶B.   ATTACKS ON INDIVIDUALS BASED ON CONTRIVED INFORMATION 
     BY THE MEDIA USING EXISTING SECURITY ORGANIZATION SYSTEMS 
     BREED MISUNDERSTANDINGS, MISTRUST, DIVISIONS AND UNDERMINE 
     THE CREDIBILITY OF THE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS.  TYPICAL 
     EXAMPLES ARE: 
 
       (1)  COUP REPORT BY RAY CHOTO/MARK CHAVHUNDUKA 
(2)  THE ALLEGED BURIAL OF A SOLIDER WITHOUT A HEAD BY GRACE 
KWINJEH 
(3)  DRC REPORTS ON ALLEGED LOOTING BY ZIMBABWEAN MILITARY 
AND POLITICAL LEADERSHIP 
(4)  ATTACKS ON THE PERSON AND OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 
(5)  MASARA-NYAROTA REPORT 
(6)  ALLEGATIONS OF POLITICAL VICTIMIZATION BY PRISON 
OFFICERS. IN ALL THESE CASES, NO IOTA OF EVIDENCE WAS 
PROVIDED. 
(7)  FINGAZ REPORT BY DAVID MASUNDA ALLEGING THAT THE 
SECURITY CHIEFS HAD ADVISED THE PRESIDENT TO GO. 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  00107  02 OF 03  101512Z 
  ¶C.   WHILST IT IS KNOWN THAT MEDIA HOUSES ARE IN BUSINESS, 
     THEY MUST NOT GENERATE PROFITS OUT OF FALSE REPORTS THAT 
     DISCREDIT THE LEADERSHIP AND MEMBERSHIP OF SECURITY 
     ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
  ¶D.   SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS BY THEIR NATURE ARE SENSITIVE 
     INSTITUTIONS AND THE SAME APPLIES TO THE INCUMBENT 
     LEADERSHIP.  THIS IS NOT A NEW POINT TO MAKE AS THIS 
     SENSITIVITY IS KNOWN AND RESPECTED IN AND BY ALL SOCIETIES 
     OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING INSTITUTIONS I THOSE SOCIETIES.  IT 
     IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT THAT MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS VERIFY 
     REPORTS ON SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS PRIOR TO THEIR 
     PUBLICATION.  MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT 
     INDIVIDUALS IN SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS 
     LIKE ANY OTHER CITIZEN OF ZIMBABWE. 
 
  ¶E.   THE MEDIA SHOULD NOT CREATE SITUATIONS THAT INVITE THE 
     SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS TO BE INVOLVED.  OUR EXPERIENCES HAVE 
     SHOWN THAT WHEN SITUATIONS DETERIORATE AND SECURITY FORCES 
     ARE CALLED UP, IT IS USUALLY THE INNOCENT MAJORITY WHO 
     SUFFER MOST.  FURTHERMORE, EXPERIENCE ALSO SHOWS THAT 
     MISREPRESENTATION OF FACTS BY THE MEDIA HAVE RESULTED IN 
     CONFLICTS. 
 
¶10. WE ARE THEREFORE ADVISING ALL CITIZENS OF ZIMBABWE THAT 
ANY REPORTS AND ACTIONS DESIGNED TO CREATE INSTABILITY IN 
ZIMBABWE WILL BE MET BY THE FULL FORCE OF THE LAW.  THIS 
WILL INCLUDE ENFORCEMENT, WHERE IT IS DEEMED NECESSARY. 
INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ANSWERABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS.  THE LAW 
WILL TAKE ITS COURSE TO ENSURE THAT ZIMBABWE'S INDEPENDENCE, 
TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND SOVEREIGNTY, WHICH TO A LARGE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  00107  02 OF 03  101512Z 
EXTEND DEPEND ON UPHOLDING THE VALUES AND GOOD NAME OF THE 
SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE PRESERVED. 
 
¶11. SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE THEREFORE APPEALING TO OUR 
PARLIAMENTARIANS TO ENACT LAWS THAT PROTECT OUR SOVEREIGNTY 
AND INDEPENDENCE AND THAT SERVE THE INTERESTS OF THE 
MAJORITY OF ZIMBABWEANS. 
 
¶12. THE SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS WANT ZIMBABWEANS TO CAMPAIGN 
AND VOTE IN A PEACEFUL MANNER.  THERE SHOULD BE NO 
ENCOURAGEMENT OF VIOLENCE AND POLITICAL LEADERS AND THEIR 
FOLLOWERS SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS.  SECURITY 
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE RESOLVED TO PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT 
CONDUCIVE TO A PEACEFUL ELECTORAL PROCESS. 
 
¶13. IN PURSUING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES, THE SECURITY 
ORGANIZATIONS ARE GUIDED BY TWO CRUCIAL VALUES.  THE FIRST 
AND MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT THOSE WHO FOUGHT AND DIED FOR THE 
LIBERATION OF ZIMBABWE DID NOT DO SO IN VAIN.  SECONDLY, ANY 
CHANGE DESIGNED TO REVERSE THE GAINS OF THIS REVOLUTION WILL 
NOT BE SUPPORTED. 
 
¶14. AS WE CONCLUDE THIS PRESS BRIEF, WE WISH TO MAKE IT VERY 
CLEAR TO ALL ZIMBABWEAN CITIZENS THAT THE SECURITY

ORGANIZATIONS WILL ONLY STAND IN SUPPORT OF THOSE POLITICAL 
LEADERS THAT WILL PURSUE ZIMBABWEAN VALUES, TRADITIONS AND 
BELIEFS FOR WHICH THOUSANDS OF LIVES WERE LOST, IN PURSUIT 
OF ZIMBABWE'S HARD WON INDEPENDENCE, SOVEREIGNTY, 
TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND NATIONAL INTERESTS.  TO THIS END, 
LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE HIGHEST OFFICE ON THE LAND IS A 
"STRAIGHT JACKET" WHOSE OCCUPANT IS EXPECTED TO OBSERVE THE 
OBJECTIVES OF THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE.  WE WILL THEREFORE 
NOT ACCEPT, LET ALONE SUPPORT OR SALUTE ANYONE WITH A 
DIFFERENT AGENDA THAT THREATENS THE VERY EXISTENCE OF OUR 
SOVEREIGNTY, OUR COUNTRY AND OUR PEOPLE. 
 
¶15. WE THANK YOU ALL FOR LISTENING AND WE DO HOP WE HAVE 
MADE OUR POSITION VERY CLEAR TO OUR FELLOW CITIZENS.
