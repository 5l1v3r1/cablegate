BILL 
 
 
¶1.   STATE-OWNED MEDIA REPORTING ON THE HOUSE PASSAGE 
   OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT 
   (ZDERA) REFLECTS IS CRITICAL OF THE BILL.  THE MAIN 
   POINTS MADE BY THE STATE-OWNED BROADCAST AND PRINT 
   MEDIA ARE THAT: 
-    ZDERA IS A SANCTIONS BILL THAT WILL HURT THE 
    PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE; 
-    CREATION AND PASSAGE OF ZDERA WAS ENGINEERED BY 
    THE OPPOSITION MDC PARTY, THE BRITISH, COMMERCIAL 
    FARMERS AND A RANGE OF OTHER PERCEIVED ENEMIES; 
-    ZDERA IS AN UNJUSTIFIABLE ATTACK ON ZIMBABWEAN 
    SOVEREIGNTY; 
-    THE US DID NOT CONSULT WITH THE GOZ PRIOR TO 
    PASSAGE OF THE BILL. 
 
¶2.   THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD" 
   DEDICATED ITS DECEMBER 7 EDITORIAL TO COMMENT ON THE 
   ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT (ZDERA). 
   UNDER HEADLINE "BETRAYAL BY THE INDIGENOUS," THE PAPER 
   COMMENTS: 
 
¶3.   "THE SANCTIONS BILL SPONSORED BY THE MOVEMENT OF 
   DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) HAS FINALLY SUCCEEDED IN 
   PASSING BOTH HOUSES OF THE AMERICAN CONGRESS.  IT 
   WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS THE BIGGEST BETRAYAL 
   AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE BY ITS OWN SONS AND 
   DAUGHTERS. . .  MORGAN TSVANGIRAI (MDC LEADER), 
   WELSHMAN NCUBE, TENDAI BITI, SEKAI HOLLAND AND THE 
   REST OF THE UNCLE TOMS SHALL BE JUDGED BY HISTORY 
   FOR THE EVIL THEY HAVE UNLEASHED UPON THE PEOPLE OF 
   ZIMBABWE. . .  IN ALL HONESTY, DOES HE (TSVANGIRAI) 
   BELIEVE THAT THE AMERICANS CARE A HOOT ABOUT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

   DEMOCRACY IN ZIMBABWE?  OF COURSE NOT.  NEITHER DO 
   THE AMERICANS HAVE A FIGHT WITH ZIMBABWE.  IT IS
