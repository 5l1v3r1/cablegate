SUBJECT: Demand Explodes at Forex Auctions 
 
¶1. Summary: With the bargain-basement exchange rate of 
Z$5300:US$ still holding, buyers of foreign exchange at 
the Reserve Bank's (RBZ) twice-weekly currency auctions 
are gobbling up as much as they can.  Yet with exports 
apparently dropping, the RBZ lacks inflows to satisfy 
most importers.  End summary. 
 
Dirt-cheap U.S. dollars 
----------------------- 
¶2. Consider the surge of total bid amounts at July 
auctions: 
 
7/1       US$  30 million 
7/5            27 
7/8            30 
7/12           29 
7/15           32 
7/19           35 
7/22           38 
7/26           40 
7/29           44 
 
Forex demand in July increased nearly 50 percent.  As 
recently as June 17, bids totaled just US$ 10 million. 
 
¶3. Due to disappointing export revenue, the RBZ has been 
able to offer a mere US$ 9.5 million at each auction. 
Forex is so scarce that auction winners now must wait two 
months until the U.S. dollars land in their accounts.  At 
the auction's steeply overvalued Z$5300:US$ exchange 
rate, importers tell us they will buy any forex quantity 
they can get their hands on.  In his address last week, 
RBZ Governor Gono expressed concern that auctions winners 
might be using forex for speculative rather than 
productive activities. 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶4. We expect the auction rate to soon reach Z$5600:US$, 
which is the RBZ's new guaranteed exchange for street 
purchases.  This will not help much, since a very 
restrained parallel market (trading penalties are still 
severe) now trades at Z$7200:US$.  As we have said 
repeatedly, the RBZ's commitment to an overvalued 
zimdollar is undermining exporters, whose other costs - 
wages, a new multi-layered value-added tax, electricity 
at double the region's average - are also rising.  Many 
of these firms are only being kept afloat through RBZ 
loans at negative real interest rates.  Ultimately, we do 
not know how many will survive this policy.
