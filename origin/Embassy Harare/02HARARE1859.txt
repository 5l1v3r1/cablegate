  ¶1.   Under headline "Evict defiant farmers" the government- 
      controlled daily "Chronicle" dedicated its August 15 
      editorial to encouraging the government of Zimbabwe to 
      eject all "defiant farmers" from the designated commercial 
      farms under the fast-trek land reform program.  "Terrorists 
      masquerading as farmers must be crushed," the editorial 
      bellowed.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .It is pertinent to warn any farmer that there is 
      no individual, whether they have blue eyes or white skin, 
      who can take the might of the State and win.  In fact no 
      government will tolerate that.  Ours will not be an 
      exception.  That is called terrorism and to quote U. S. 
      President George W. Bush, no resources will be spared to 
      fight terrorists.  Terrorists masquerading as farmers must 
      be crushed. . .If Britain and the U. S. really care about 
      their citizens they should advise them to comply by moving 
      out of the acquired farms peacefully as they face forcible 
      eviction. . .No amount of statements from the U. S. State 
      Department or Britain will change that.  Not even 
      `extending' the hollow personal sanctions against the 
      government can stop the agrarian revolution. . .In short, 
      to borrow a phrase from Mr. Bush, they must be `flushed 
      out' before their tails grow longer."
