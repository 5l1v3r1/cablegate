¶1.   THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" AND THE 
    GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD" COVERED THE 
    SEPTEMBER 20 AMERICAN EMBASSY TELEVISION INTERACTIVE 
    CENTERING ON AFRICAN DIPLOMACY AFTER THE TERROR ATTACKS 
    IN THE U. S. WITH MR. WILLIAM M. BELLAMY, ACTING 
    ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AFRICAN AFFAIRS. 
    CONCENTRATING ON BELLAMY'S RESPONSES TO A QUESTION 
    REGARDING THE FATE OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND 
    ECONOMIC RECOVERY BILL AFTER THE TERRORIST ATTACKS AND 
    THE ABUJA ACCORD RAISED BY MARVELOUS MAPININGA, DEPUTY 
    NEWS EDITOR OF "THE HERALD" (WHO ALSO COVERED THE FRANK 
    AND LIVELY DISCUSSION PROGRAM), THE SEPTEMBER 21 
    EDITIONS OF THE TWO NEWSPAPERS CARRIED THE FOLLOWING 
    ARTICLES: 
 
¶2.   UNDER HEADLINE "U. S. ACTION ON MUGABE IMMINENT," 
    THE LEAD ARTICLE IN THE "DAILY NEWS" BY THE PAPER'S 
    CHIEF REPORTER CONRAD NYAMUTATA READS: 
 
    "THE U.S., STILL SMARTING FROM FATAL TERRORIST 
    ATTACKS LAST WEEK, SAYS DESPITE THE TRAGEDY, IT 
    WOULD STILL TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AGAINST 
    ZIMBABWE BECAUSE OF RECURRENT STATE-SPONSORED 
    VIOLENCE.  SPEAKING FROM WASHINGTON VIA SATELLITE 
    YESTERDAY, WILLIAM BELLAMY, THE U. S. ACTING 
    ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AFRICAN AFFAIRS, 
    VIRTUALLY SIGNALED THE IMPENDING IMPOSITION OF 
    SANCTIONS AGAINST ZIMBABWE UNLESS THE SITUATION 
    CHANGED.  HE WAS RESPONDING TO A QUESTION ON THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  02793  01 OF 02  240625Z 
    FATE OF THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC 
    RECOVERY BILL, AFTER TERRORIST ATTACKS IN WHICH 
    HIJACKERS ON THREE CIVILIAN PLANES RAMMED INTO THE 
    WORLD TRADE CENTER AND THE PENTAGON, WHILE A FOURTH 
    CRASHED INTO THE GROUND ON 11 SEPTEMBER.  THE BILL, 
    SEEKING TO IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON ZIMBABWE, WAS TO BE 
    TABLED BEFORE CONGRESS THIS MONTH.  'I CAN'T SAY 
    WHAT ACTION CONGRESS WILL TAKE ON THAT PIECE OF 
    LEGISLATION,' HE SAID, 'BUT CONCERN IN THE U. S. 
    OVER EVENTS IN ZIMBABWE REMAINS HIGH.'  BELLAMY, 
    ACCUSING THE MUGABE GOVERNMENT OF FOMENTING 
    LAWLESSNESS, SAID ACTION AGAINST ZIMBABWE WAS 
    ALMOST CERTAIN.  'WE ARE CONCERNED BY THE VIOLENCE 
    ORCHESTRATED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE, AND THE 
    POLITICAL REPRESSION,' HE SAID.  'THE CONCERNS 
    REMAIN FOREMOST.  AND I MUST SAY THERE IS CONSENSUS 
    BETWEEN THE U. S. ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS FOR 
    AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE ON 
    ZIMBABWE. . . .'" 
 
¶3.   UNDER HEADLINE "U. S. SECRETARY OF STATE REFUSES 
    TO DISCUSS ABUJA PACT," THE "HERALD" PUBLISHED 
    FOLLOWING ARTICLE BY  MARVELOUS MANIPININGA ON PAGE 
    TWO: 
 
    "THE ACTING U. S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR 
    AFRICAN AFFAIRS, MR. WILLIAM BELLAMY, YESTERDAY 
    REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT THE LANDMARK ABUJA AGREEMENT, 
    PREFERRING INSTEAD TO FOCUS ON VIOLENCE IN ZIMBABWE 
    WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS PHANTOM BY THE 
    GOVERNMENT.  SPEAKING FROM WASHINGTON DURING A TELE- 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  02793  01 OF 02  240625Z 
    CONFERENCE WITH JOURNALISTS FROM SOUTH AFRICA, 
    NIGERIA, UGANDA AND ZIMBABWE, MR. BELLAMY SAID THE 
    ¶U. S. CONGRESS AND ADMINISTRATION WERE CONCERNED 
    WITH THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY.  THE 
    MINISTER OF STATE FOR INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY, 
    PROFESSOR JONATHAN MOYO, SAID THE LANGUAGE ABOUT 
    VIOLENCE COMING FROM MR. BELLAMY WAS 'MOST 
    UNHELPFUL.'  'VIOLENCE BEGETS VIOLENCE AND THE TALK 
    ABOUT PHANTOM VIOLENCE IN ZIMBABWE CAN ONLY 
    ENCOURAGE UNSCRUPULOUS ELEMENTS, AMONG THEM EX- 
    RHODESIANS BELONGING TO THE MDC (MOVEMENT FOR 
    DEMOCRATIC CHANGE), TO INSTIGATE VIOLENCE IN THE 
    HOPE OF USING IT AS A POLITICAL PLATFORM. . .WE ARE 
    TOTALLY AGAINST VIOLENCE AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE THE 
    MOST PEACEFUL COUNTRY IN THE REGION. . .THE TIME 
    HAS COME FOR PEOPLE LIKE MR. BELLAMY TO IDENTIFY 
    VIOLENCE WHERE IT IS AND IT IS CERTAINLY NOT IN 
    ZIMBABWE BECAUSE WE WILL NOT ALLOW IT,' SAID 
    PROFESSOR MOYO. . .(HE), HOWEVER, SAID FAIR-MINDED 
    OBSERVERS WOULD BE SHOCKED AND DISAPPOINTED BY MR. 
    BELLAMY'S REFUSAL TO COMMENT ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT
