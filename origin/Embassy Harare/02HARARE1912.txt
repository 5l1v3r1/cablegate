  ¶1.   Under headline "Powell faces more protests on 
      return to Africa" the August 22 edition of the 
      government-controlled daily "The Herald" carried 
      the following opinion piece by Tim Chigodo on 
      page 11: 
 
  ¶2.   "U. S. Secretary of State, Mr. Colin Powell is 
      returning to Africa, a continent he despises. 
      Mr. Powell who is well known for his anti- 
      African views will head the U. S. delegation to 
      the 10-day World Summit on Sustainable 
      Development (WSSD) starting August 26 in place 
      of President George W. Bush who has skipped the 
      meeting. . .  Since assuming America's top and 
      powerful foreign post, the Gulf war veteran has 
      made more enemies in Africa than anywhere else 
      in the world. . .  He faces more protests on his 
      return. . .  The U. S. Secretary of State has 
      never had love for Africa and would therefore be 
      the least expected to say anything positive 
      about the continent and its leaders. . .  While 
      Mr. Powell has been criticized as an Uncle Tom, 
      President Mugabe is revered the world over for 
      he has fought colonialism and refuses to be 
      cowed down by super powers.  To black people he 
      is symbol of strength.  Mr. Powell does not 
      understand Africa that he denigrates and 
      therefore cannot be expected to help the 
      continent solve its many problems. . . ."
