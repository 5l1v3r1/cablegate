¶1.   THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "CHRONICLE" 
   DEDICATED ITS DECEMBER 8 EDITORIAL TO CONDEMN THE 
   ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT (ZDERA) OF 
   ¶2001.  UNDER HEADLINE "DEMOCRACY BILL, A BULLYING 
   TACTIC," THE PAPER COMMENTS: 
 
¶2.   ". . .IT IS STRANGE THAT THERE SHOULD BE 
   ZIMBABWEANS CELEBRATING AMERICA'S PASSING OF A SO- 
   CALLED DEMOCRACY BILL THAT IN FACT SEEKS TO CURTAIL 
   DEMOCRACY.  IT IS AN OPEN SECRET THAT THE WORLD'S 
   FORMER COLONIAL POWERS ALREADY HAVE A CANDIDATE IN MIND 
   AND THEY ARE ONLY WAITING FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF 
   RESULTS AT THE PRESIDENTIAL PLEBISCITE.  WE ARE TOLD 
   THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE SO-CALLED ZDERA IS TO PRESSURE 
   PRESIDENT MUGABE INTO HOLDING FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS 
   AND ESTABLISH LAND OWNERSHIP PROTECTION.  THERE IS AN 
   INSINUATION HERE THAT IT IS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION THAT 
   THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WILL NOT BE FREE AND FAIR. 
   WE SYMPATHIZE WITH THE IGNORANCE AND NAIVETY (SIC) OF 
   THE AMERICANS.  IF THEY EVER BOTHERED TO READ 
   ZIMBABWE'S HISTORY, THEY WOULD KNOW THAT THIS COUNTRY 
   HAS HELD SEVERAL ELECTIONS THAT WERE FREE AND FAIR. 
   ANYWAY, WHO ARE THE AMERICANS TO TEACH US ABOUT 
   CONDUCTING FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS WHEN THEY THEMSELVES 
   FAILED DISMALLY TO CONDUCT PROPER PRESIDENTIAL 
   ELECTIONS EARLY THIS YEAR.  FOR ALL WE KNOW THE 
   INCUMBENT PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH IS IN POWER 
   FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION OF THE COURTS IN THAT 
   COUNTRY.  IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL DEMOCRACY?  FAILURES 
   LIKE THE AMERICANS DO NOT QUALIFY TO LECTURE ZIMBABWE 
   ON DEMOCRACY. . .  THE AMERICAN EVIL BILL IS AN ATTEMPT 
   TO RUN ZIMBABWE BY REMOTE CONTROL, AND WE SAY NO TO 
   THIS.  WE ARE A SOVEREIGN STATE WHICH DOES NOT NEED
