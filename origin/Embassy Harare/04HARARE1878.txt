¶1. (SBU) The GOZ is collaborating with Interpol's Subregional 
Bureau for Southern Africa on a Regional Working Meeting on 
Trafficking in Human Beings scheduled to take place in Harare 
November 29-30.   Sources at the Zimbabwe Republic Police 
(ZRP) indicated that they would share with us material on the 
GOZ's TIP work to be submitted at the meeting.  However, 
despite a request via an August diplomatic note and numerous 
subsequent direct requests for an appointment, we have been 
unable to secure a meeting with officials at the Central 
Investigation Division (CID), the ZRP office responsible for 
TIP issues, to develop more information for the interim 
assessment.  CID Chief Stephen Mutamba told us that he would 
be willing to meet us but needed the approval of the ZRP 
Commissioner, which has yet to come.  MFA counterparts told 
us in August that they would facilitate a meeting and wanted 
to cooperate on TIP, a "shared priority," but have been 
unable to secure the meeting.  Accordingly, for now we have 
little to report about the areas of inquiry identified in ref 
A but will relay information upon receipt of the working 
papers or after a meeting with the ZRP or other GOZ offices 
with a role in TIP. 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT: Police reticence to deal with us on TIP is 
not surprising.  Career-minded GOZ officials at every level 
are suspicious of foreign inquiries and afraid of disclosing 
information that might be prejudicial to the GOZ if 
publicized.  GOZ co-sponsorship of the regional conference 
and occasional coverage of TIP-related issues by the state 
media suggest some degree of seriousness about the issue, 
however.  Indeed, the regional conference presents an 
opportunity for us to reduce suspicions and to project our 
shared interests in TIP.  We will continue to seek meetings 
with the ZRP and other relevant offices to discuss GOZ's 
anti-TIP efforts and will send an observer to the Harare 
Working Meeting.
