¶1. (U) The Government of Zimbabwe is a recipient of FY09 
foreign assistance, as defined in Ref A, under the Department 
of State Foreign Operations and Related Programs 
Appropriations Act (SFOAA).  Post therefore provides the 
following response to the questions contained in Ref A. 
 
¶2.  (U) The Government of Zimbabwe's budget is publicly 
available, and incomes and expenditures are included in the 
budget. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The formation of an inclusive government in 
February, 2009 and the appointment of Tendai Biti of the 
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), which had been the 
opposition party, as Minister of Finance, paved the way for 
the introduction of a revised and considerably more realistic 
FY09 budget.  Soon after taking office, Biti introduced a 
cash budget (Ref B), i.e. expenditures match revenue, and he 
prohibited off-budget spending.  He also seized back 
traditional finance ministry powers from the Governor of the 
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, who had mismanaged public finance 
in the past years. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) A recent IMF mission to Zimbabwe concluded that the 
Government's income estimate for FY09 was overly optimistic 
(Ref C).  In light of the gaping lack of information on 
private sector activity and its capacity to rebound, we 
nevertheless believe that the budget broadly reflects actual 
government incomes and expenditures in this first year of 
economic recovery in Zimbabwe in over a decade, and that the 
budget is therefore in compliance with Section 7088(c) of the 
SFOAA.
