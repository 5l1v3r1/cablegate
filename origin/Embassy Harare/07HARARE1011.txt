On the Political/Social Front 
----------------------------- 
Turmoil in the MDC - Controversy over the MDC's dissolution of its 
Women's Assembly continues to roil.  President Morgan Tsvangirai 
claims the decision was made because of mismanagement by Assembly 
chair Lucia Matibenga.  Matibenga and her allies within the party 
counter that the action was without foundation and 
extra-constitutional, and is an example of Tsvangirai's dictatorial 
behavior.  Civil society women's groups have not surprisingly lined 
up to support Matibenga.  Regardless of which side is right, the MDC 
has at least been temporarily weakened at a time it should be 
concentrating on preparing for next year's elections.  See Harare 
¶1004. 
 
Mobile Voter Registration Still Unsatisfactory - The Zimbabwe 
Electoral Support Network (ZESN) has concluded that the same 
problems that afflicted a mobile registration exercise between June 
and August are still present in a mobile registration drive that 
began on October 26 and will continue until November 15.  Due to a 
lack of publicity, people are unaware of when and where they can 
register.  Political parties have not been involved in creating 
awareness of the registration opportunity.  For logistical reason, 
people have been unable to acquire IDs necessary for registration. 
On the positive side, ZESN reported that the registration process 
has been peaceful and there has been an absence of intimidation. 
 
Attorney General Arrested - Attorney General Sobusa Gula Ndebele was 
arrested on allegations of abuse of office on Tuesday.  Ndebele 
allegedly assured former NMBZ Holdings deputy managing director 
James Mushore, who fled Zimbabwe in 2004 while facing charges of 
externalizing foreign currency, that he would not be prosecuted if 
he returned to the country.  Mushore did in fact return in September 
and is still in custody after being arrested.  Ndebele, who is 
associated with the Mujuru faction and is considered an honest 
prosecutor, last year unsuccessfully tried to prosecute his boss, 
Justice Minister Patrick Chinimasa, for obstruction of justice for 
allegedly trying to dissuade witnesses from testifying in an assault 
trial against Security Minister Didymus Mutasa. 
 
WOZA continues with its campaign - calling for an end to political 
violence - Women of Zimbabwe Arise staged another peaceful 
demonstration in Harare on November 6, to protest the "continued 
harassment of and violence against human rights activists at the 
hands of the Zimbabwe Republic Police." More than 250 members 
reportedly took part in this demonstration at Parliament and were 
arrested by the police riot squad who beat a number of women with 
baton sticks. 98 members were detained for 7 hours at Harare Central 
before being released.  Unusually, the police asked the WOZA members 
to state their grievances and to notify the police in advance of any 
future protests. 
 
Magistrates and Prosecutor's strike cripples the judicial sector - 
The National Association of Magistrate's called for a nationwide 
strike last week giving the GOZ an ultimatum of Friday November 2, 
 
HARARE 00001011  002 OF 003 
 
 
to meet its wage demands - or face labor action from the group. By 
Monday November 5, most junior magistrates at the local and 
provincial level had heeded the call in Harare and Mutare and 
stopped going to work. The lowest paid magistrate earns about $ 20 
million a month, (US$16 on the parallel market).  The strike will 
further damage a judicial system already crippled by a lack of 
resources.

On the Economic and Business front 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
"Mother of all Seasons" - But Is There Enough Seed*? - The local 
production of seed for this planting season is arguably well below 
the national requirement.  The local supply of seed maize has 
historically been 35,000 metric tons - sufficient to plant for 1.4 
million hectares. However, the GOZ is aiming to put 2 million 
hectares under maize production this season, pushing the seed 
requirement to 50,000 metric tons, according to the seed houses. 
With regard to small grains, the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) and 
the Agriculture Coordination Working Group under FAO leadership 
maintain that sorghum is in very short supply with stocks estimated 
at 1,400 metric tons against a national requirement of 4,000 metric 
tons. Moreover, the amount of soy bean seed available is just 8,400 
metric tons, which is sufficient to plant an area of about 84,000 
hectares, yet the GOZ is targeting 120,000 hectares this season. The 
CFU also estimates that ground nut seed is in short supply and there 
is no sunflower seed at all in the country. Whether Zimbabwe will be 
able to produce the oil seed needed to alleviate the acute cooking 
oil shortage depends primarily on the ability to import seed. In 
view of the perennial foreign currency shortages, Reserve Bank 
Governor Goon's "mother of all agricultural seasons" could be a 
mother of all disappointments. Only cotton and tobacco seed are said 
to be in adequate supply for the targeted land area this summer. 
 
National Social Security Authority (NSSA) To Raise Pension Payouts - 
How Far Will The Money Go? -  In oral evidence presented to the 
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Public Service, Labor and 
Social Welfare, NSSA acting Director of Finance and Investment James 
Matiza announced that with effect from 2008 NSSA will increase its 
monthly minimum pension payouts from Z$250,000 (US$0.21 on the 
parallel market) to Z$10,000,000 (US$8.33), with the highest paid 
pensioner receiving Z$23 million (US$19.17), up from Z$350,000 
(US$0.29).  While the increases appear high in nominal terms, by the 
time they reach the pensioners' purses, hyperinflation will likely 
have eroded it all away. 
 
Private Sector Estimates of Inflation Surge - See Harare 1003 for an 
overview of the latest private sector estimates of inflation - deep 
in 5-digit territory. 
 
Prices Continue To Soar on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) - 
Activity on the ZSE has been high in recent months with almost all 
counters registering significant price increases. Both the 
industrial and mining indices have risen to dizzying heights, thanks 
to a number of factors. The introduction of the concessionary 
BACOSSI facility has depressed interest rates on the money market 
resulting in investors opting for the stock market.  In addition, 
numerous companies have been churning out impressive interim and 
end-of-year results in nominal terms at least, although in real 
terms, many of them have registered significant declines. The mining 
index has also benefited from the upswing in prices of most metals, 
including gold, platinum and chrome, even though Zimbabwe on the 
whole has hardly benefited due to its poor investment climate. 
 
Reserve Bank Governor Gono Shelves Plans To Introduce New Currency - 
Gono told the state-controlled Sunday Mail that a new currency would 
not be launched any time soon.  See "Quote of the Week" below for 
more color.  We assume he meant no new bearer cheques either any 
time soon.  How long Gono can go without introducing new notes to

billions, trillions and quadrillions is unclear.
