SUBJECT: CHINESE ENGAGEMENT IN ZIMBABWE 
 
REF: 10 STATE 10152 
 
¶1.  (U) Although statistics are not readily available, anecdotal 
evidence shows increasing Chinese involvement in Zimbabwe's 
economy.  The trend became pronounced with the Government of 
Zimbabwe's (GOZ) "Look East Policy" in 2003, through which it 
sought to emphasize new ties with China in place of traditional 
links to Europe and North America.  Chinese enterprises are 
noticeably active in the retail and construction sectors.  One 
local press report suggests that 80 percent of Chinese-owned 
enterprises are in the retail sector.  But Chinese construction 
projects receive far more public attention - often negative.  For 
example, an eight-year-old plan involving Chinese contractors to 
widen the highway between Harare and Bulawayo collapsed after only 
20 kilometers of construction amid allegations of poor workmanship 
and corruption. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U) There has been significant Chinese investment in industrial 
enterprises.  In 2007 Sinosteel Corporation bought Zimasco 
Consolidated Enterprises Limited, Zimbabwe's largest ferrochrome 
producer.  Zimasco suspended production in 2009.  In 2004 the China 
Building Material Industrial Corporation entered into a joint 
venture with the Industrial Development Corporation of Zimbabwe to 
establish the Sino-Zimbabwe Cement plant in Midlands Province. 
Chinese firms also provided agricultural equipment worth millions 
of dollars under the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe's farm mechanization 
program in order to show support for the GOZ's land reform program. 
In 2009, Zimbabwean officials announced a multi-billion dollar 
Chinese investment in platinum mining, but there is no evidence of 
actual investment on this scale. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) The GOZ's severe fiscal constraints have put limits on 
Chinese engagement.  The GOZ is in arrears on its US$400 million in 
official debt to China, and this has blocked access to lines of 
credit reportedly worth as much as US$950 million.  According to 
GOZ figures, as of March 2009 Zimbabwe owed US$37.2 million to 
China in unpaid principal and interest. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) There are no concrete examples of U.S.-China collaboration 
in Zimbabwe.  Ambassador Ray met with the Chinese ambassador who 
indicated his desire to maintain a dialogue with the U.S. and other 
Western countries.  The principal aims of U.S. policy in Zimbabwe 
are a return to democratic governance, restoration of the rule of 
law, and protection of human rights.  While China has remained 
silent on these subjects, it has moved from sole support of ZANU-PF 
to a more balanced approach and now has relationships with both 
ZANU-PF and MDC-T.  The Chinese embassy recently sponsored a golf 
tournament in honor of Prime Minister Tsvangirai.    While China 
may share an interest with the U.S. in restoring Zimbabwe's 
investment climate, progress in this area ultimately depends on 
governance reforms.
