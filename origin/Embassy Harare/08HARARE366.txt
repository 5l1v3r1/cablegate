SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) Coca Cola is in Zimbabwe for the long haul, but the 
company and its bottlers are plagued by the problems of labor 
retention, access to foreign exchange, sugar procurement, 
punitive price controls, and power and water outages.  A 
senior executive believed that the technical state of the 
bottling plants was still good and key personnel would return 
to Zimbabwe once a recovery set in; the biggest constraint on 
returning to normal operation would be the poor state of 
Zimbabwe's sugar refineries.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------- 
The Challenge of Retaining Labor 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Coca Cola's Senior Operations Marketing Manager in 
Zimbabwe, Togarepi Chinoda, told econoff on April 21 that 
Coca Cola was in Zimbabwe for the long haul despite a 
plethora of challenges. From a staff of 49 in 1998, four 
employees now managed the brand. Of 20 management trainees 
taken on, Chinoda said an average of only one was willing to 
remain with the company after two years of training, 
primarily due to poor remuneration.  Coca Cola's solution to 
the white-collar staffing problem was to intensify management 
training and promise a temporary posting to a Coca Cola 
operation elsewhere in the region. Chinoda himself had 
recently relocated to Lusaka to manage the South Central 
Africa Territory, including Zimbabwe, which he now visited 
only once a month. On the plant side, it was particularly 
difficult for the company's contracted bottlers to retain 
workers and motivate them even to show up for work. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Falling Production, No Access to Forex 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Production at Coca Cola's local bottlers (Delta 
Corporation, Schweppes Zimbabwe and Mutare Bottlers) fell 
from 63 million unit cases in 2002 to 16 million unit cases 
last year.  Although the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) 
allowed, for example, Delta to retain 100 percent of its 
foreign currency earnings, Delta had been unable to access 
any of its forex since October (50 percent of Delta's inputs 
to Coca Cola products are imported). Delta received BACOSSI 
funds from the RBZ at 25 percent annual interest last year to 
purchase raw materials, but it was only once-off funding and 
the plant had exhausted the inputs within a week. Procuring 
sugar remained a huge challenge. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Punitive Price Controls, Power/Water Shortages 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4. (SBU) Demand for Coca Cola's products was strong even at 
high prices, but the National Incomes and Pricing Commission 
(NIPC) failed to approve price increases frequently enough. 
On April 16, the bottlers had received a long awaited price 
increase but under hyperinflation even the new price (Z$17 
million a bottle - or roughly a US$ nickel at the street rate 
- up from Z$12 million) no longer covered the cost of 
production. For its part, Chinoda said Coca Cola had sought 
to minimize costs to the bottlers by taking over nearly all

their marketing and distribution functions. In the meantime, 
production at Delta had fallen to, at best, 2-3 days a week 
and suppliers were "screaming" to get paid. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Delta bottling plant in Harare had good power 
and water supply but its Bulawayo plant suffered regular 
outages. Schweppes Zimbabwe's Willowvale plant in Harare, on 
the other hand, had come to a standstill all of last week for 
lack of power and, for two days, lack of water. Chinoda 
commented that Schweppes had been hardest hit of all bottlers 
at the start of the price crackdown last year.  He assumed 
that Coca Cola's 100 percent ownership of Schweppes Zimbabwe 
and the fact that it produces Zimbabwe's national drink - 
Mazoe orange crush - had most likely attracted the attention 
of top military officials (including Police Commissioner 
Augustine Chihuri and Air Marshal Perence Shiri), who had 
descended on the plant demanding that production continue at 
all costs. 
 
------------- 
Looking Ahead 
------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Looking ahead, Chinoda felt that, from a technical 
point of view, production at the bottlers could be ramped up 
quickly and key personnel would also flock back from the 
region once a recovery set in, but the state of Zimbabwe's 
sugar refineries was a serious constraint.  He believed it 
could take up to a year to refurbish the refineries to the 
point that they could provide a steady and large enough 
supply of sugar to allow the bottlers to return to normal 
operation.
