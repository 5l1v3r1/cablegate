¶1.   UNDER HEADLINE "PRESIDENT MUGABE IS OUR CHOICE," 
   THE BULAWAYO-BASED GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY 
   "CHRONICLE" DEDICATED ITS MARCH 27 EDITORIAL TO 
   DENOUNCING THE UNITED STATES OVER ITS STANCE ON 
   ZIMBABWE'S PRESIDENTIAL POLL.  EXCERPTS: 
 
¶2.   "THE AMERICANS AND THEIR FRIENDS ELSEWHERE SEEM 
   NOT TO HAVE GOT THE MESSAGE FROM THE PEOPLE OF 
   ZIMBABWE, THAT PRESIDENT MUGABE IS OUR CHOICE AND HE 
   WILL LEAD THIS COUNTRY FOR THE NEXT SIX YEARS, COME 
   RAIN OR SUNSHINE.  IN THEIR TYPICAL BULLISH STYLE, THE 
   AMERICANS THINK THAT THEY CAN USE AID AS A WHIP TO 
   TURN AFRICANS AGAINST EACH OTHER.  WE ARE GLAD THAT 
   SUCH EFFORTS, AS EXHIBITED BY THE U.S. YESTERDAY IN 
   NIGERIA, HAVE BEEN DISMISSED FOR THE HOT AIR THAT THEY 
   ARE.  AND WE ARE CONVINCED THAT THEY WILL REMAIN PART 
   OF THE AMERICANS' WISHFUL THINKING.  WE APPLAUD THE 
   SPECIAL ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT 
   THABO MBEKI FOR TAKING EXCEPTION TO THE U.S. POSITION 
   THAT THE CONTINENT'S ENDORSEMENT OF PRESIDENT MUGABE'S 
   RE-ELECTION THREATENED WESTERN SUPPORT FOR THE NEW 
   PARTNERSHIP FOR AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT (NEPAD).  THE 
   AMERICANS HAVE IN THE PAST DEMONSTRATED THEIR LACK OF 
   DEMOCRACY BY RESORTING TO THE COURTS TO DECIDE WHO 
   WILL LEAD THEM WHEN THE OPTION OF AN ELECTION RE-RUN 
   WAS CLEAR.  NOW THEY WANT TO PREACH DEMOCRACY TO US 
   WHEN WE JUST HELD FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IN WHICH 
   THEIR CANDIDATE, MR. MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, WAS TROUNCED. 
   WE ADVISE THE AMERICANS TO WITHHOLD THEIR MONEY IF IT 
   WILL BE USED TO DESTROY DEMOCRACY AND CREATE A 
   DEPENDENCY ON DONOR FUNDS.  IF THE IDEA OF NEPAD IS TO 
   PERPETUATE THE MYTH THAT INVESTORS WILL NOT COME 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

   UNLESS WE SUBMIT TO DENIGRATION, WE UNEQUIVOCALLY TELL 
   THE AMERICANS TO LOOK ELSEWHERE BECAUSE WE DO NOT NEED 
   DIRTY MONEY."
