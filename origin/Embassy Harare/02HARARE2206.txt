SUBJECT: PRO-GOVERNMENT PAPER URGES SADC EFFORTS IN 
ANGOLA 
 
 
  ¶1.   Under the title "Angola peace initiative: Now or 
      never" the independent, pro-government "The Daily 
      Mirror" dedicated its September 30 editorial to urging 
      SADC leaders meeting in Luanda, Angola this week to 
      work towards long-lasting peace in the country. 
      Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .SADC leaders meeting in Luanda are being 
      beseeched to realize the urgency and earnest (sic) with 
      which they should treat the issue of bringing about 
      lasting peace to Angola. . .  The tragedy of Africa, 
      willingly or unwittingly, has been to be more than 
      ready to suck itself into meaningless conflicts that 
      would have been sparked by trivial and retrogressive 
      differences.  The West, which to a very large extent 
      gloated on the sidelines and fanned the flames of the 
      wars, has benefited from those conflicts and has not 
      been in a hurry to facilitate a stop to the maiming, 
      raping and killing of brother by brother. . .  Even 
      though in our African way we never celebrate the death 
      of a person no matter how bad that person might have 
      been, it can be said with confidence that the death of 
      Jonas Savimbi early this year removed most of the 
      barriers to the peace seeking process in that country. 
      . .  It is the responsibility of SADC to spread the 
      gospel of peace and to argue for the need to exploit 
      the abundant resources that have for a very long time 
      gone to waste as we spent more time at each other's 
      throat."
