Classified By: Ambassador Hugo Llorens, reasons 1.4 (b & d) 
 
¶1. (S) PolCouns and Defense Attache delivered ref a demarche 
to Minister of Defense (MOD) Aristides Mejia on October 15. 
(Note: Mejia and the Chief of Defense Romeo Vasquez Velasquez 
have discussed lax weapon control, including the cases cited 
in reftel, which they were well aware of, with various 
Emboffs on several occasions in the near past.  End Note.) 
Mejia confirmed the GOH's commitment to re-transfer, end-use 
and security obligations with respect to defense articles or 
defense services sold or granted by the USG.  Mejia noted 
that many weapons had been destroyed in accordance with 
accepted procedures in 2007, and that controls were being 
increased at many of the storage sites.  He agreed, however, 
that control and security could still be improved.  Mejia 
said the investigation into the arms that had been found in 
Mexico and Colombia (San Andres) was continuing, and promised 
to keep us informed of any developments in the investigation. 
 Mejia appreciated our offer of support for destruction and 
stockpile management.  PolCouns explained that the best way 
to tap into this offer would be to draft an official request 
for assistance. 
 
¶2. (S) Comment:  MOD officials have been extremely 
cooperative in regards to the issue of control and 
destruction of weapons in the past, and the MOD has expressed 
his willingness to support destruction and stricter controls. 
 MOD officials allowed a Chuckwagon team extensive access 
during a visit in July (ref b - g), and we expect that after 
consultation with his staff, we should receive an official 
request for assistance from Mejia.  End Comment.
