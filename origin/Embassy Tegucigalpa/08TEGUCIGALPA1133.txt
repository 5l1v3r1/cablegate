SUBJECT: PRESIDENT ZELAYA AGAIN CRITICIZES U.S. POLICY IN 
NICARAGUA 
 
REF: A. TEGUCIGALPA 1064 
     ¶B. TEGUCIGALPA 1040 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Hugo Llorens, reason 1.4 (b & d) 
 
¶1. (U) During a brief visit to Costa Rica for a graduation 
ceremony, President Manuel "Mel" Zelaya made statements on 
December 14 against U.S. policy in Nicaragua.  He said 
Honduras "laments" that the United States has intervened in 
an electoral process by questioning the outcome.  Zelaya said 
that the people of Nicaragua and its President, Daniel 
Ortega, must be respected and left to resolve their own 
situation, and that all the countries of Central America will 
join together, if necessary, to support Nicaragua and Daniel 
Ortega, as the country's elected leader. 
 
¶2. (C) Comment:  Zelaya's statement reflects his attempts to 
stay in good graces with ALBA.  Despite having signed on to 
ALBA in August, Zelaya has done little to move the Honduras' 
policies closer to that of Venezuela and its allies, and has 
worked to maintain good relations with the U.S.  His 
principal support for ALBA appear to be occasional statements 
against international capitalism and recent swings at us on 
Nicaragua.  The Ambassador personally took Zelaya to task 
(Ref A) after his first set of remarks on Nicaragua (Ref B) 
and provided him with information on irregularities in that 
countries' municipal elections.  We will continue to raise 
with Zelaya and the GOH our concerns about the threats to 
democracy in Nicaragua.  End Comment.
