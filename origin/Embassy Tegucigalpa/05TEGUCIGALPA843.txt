SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON UNCHR RESOLUTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
IN CUBA, APRIL 20, 2005 
 
 
Â¶1. The Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El Heraldo" carried 
an op-ed by Mario Alvarado on 4/16 entitled "Global View: 
Cuba and the UNCHR."  "Each year, it's getting more 
difficult for the U.S. to find an accomplice to present a 
resolution against Cuba.  This time, the Bush administration 
had to do it itself, and it was actually a defeat for them 
because it emphasizes the isolation it's going through, due 
to its aggressiveness and exclusionary policies.  They don't 
agree even with their closest allies.  But, on the other 
hand, Cuba is a pacifist country." 
 
"Cuba is not a threat to anybody.  It's the other way around 
because of their will to help other poor countries.  All the 
hatred toward Cuba is because it has shown the world that a 
society can be developed apart from the fierce capitalism 
practiced by the U.S." 
 
"The courage to defend one's country has been adopted by 
other popular movements in the Third World.  Cuba and 
Venezuela are not Iraq, and they are not alone in the 
battle.  The structural weakness of the Empire cannot defeat 
the Iraqi people."
