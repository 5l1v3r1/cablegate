Poloff delivered reftel demarche on the pursuit of a 
reduction in the overall number of one-sided UN General 
Assembly resolutions on the Middle East; and, the defeat of 
three resolutions contained in ref A to the  MFA,s Director 
of Multilateral Policy Jose Lorenzana on November 21. Poloff 
stated that the resolutions noted above are among the 
important votes on which we have been hoping for an 
improvement in UNGA voting coincidence as discussed earlier 
this year with the Foreign Minister (ref B).   Lorenzana 
stated that, in the past, Hondurans had voted against some of 
the resolutions and then been absent for the others, but said 
he would check with the Foreign Minister and be in touch with 
us.  Post will continue to follow-up on the UNGA voting 
coincidence of the GOH and report back any updated response 
to this particular demarche.
