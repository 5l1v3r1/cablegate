¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Cuban Government recently promised to 
provide hundreds of thousands of Cuban-made energy-efficient 
lightbulbs to the island-nations of Antigua and Barbuda, 
Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  Cuban aid in 
the region, previously confined largely to medical assistance 
and scholarships (Ref B), seems to be taking a new angle with 
this initiative.  This illuminating aid complements 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's PetroCaribe concessionary 
oil financing deal rather nicely, and helps Fidel Castro 
purchase an oath of silence from Eastern Caribbean leaders 
regarding Cuban human rights abuses.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) According to a press statement from the Government of 
Antigua and Barbuda, Cuba is offering to replace 215,000 
lightbulbs with energy-efficient Cuban-made bulbs.  The 
statement claims these bulbs could cut Antigua and Barbuda's 
energy bill by US$1.5 million a year.  A similar statement by 
the Government of Grenada mentions that the bulbs are 
supposed to last for 10,000 hours and use 50 to 80 percent 
less electricity than normal bulbs.  According to local press 
in St. Vincent, that country will also receive similar light 
bulb aid. 
 
¶3.  (U)  This initiative accompanies a Cuban expansion of its 
diplomatic presence in the Eastern Caribbean.  In April, Cuba 
is scheduled to open new embassies in Antigua and Barbuda, 
Dominica, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, making it the 
only country other than Venezuela to have an Embassy in all 
seven of the Eastern Caribbean islands Embassy Bridgetown 
covers.  (Note:  China has Embassies in every Eastern 
Caribbean island except the two that recognize Taiwan, St. 
Kitts and Nevis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  End 
Note.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Comment:  Rising oil prices have hit these 
cash-strapped islands hard.  Venezuela's PetroCaribe 
initiative combined with this new Cuban lightbulb aid could 
help both countries brighten their image and increase their 
influence in the Eastern Caribbean.  These two energy 
programs expand on previous Cuban medical and educational 
assistance and appear to be another example of coordinated 
Venezuelan/Cuban aid activity in the region (Ref A).  While 
Eastern Caribbean leaders reject Cuban and Venezuelan leftist 
social models, Cuba's aid efforts have bought the country 
support in the U.N. and silence from regional leaders on 
Cuba's human rights abuses and lack of democracy.  End 
Comment.
