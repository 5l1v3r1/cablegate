REF: STATE 108921 
 
¶1. (SBU) CDA conveyed reftel points to St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves and Foreign 
Minister Louis Straker in meetings October 26.  PM Gonsalves 
said he was displeased with the images of abuse displayed 
during Iran's recent presidential election, adding that his 
June 2009 trip to Tehran showed an apparent lack of religious 
diversity.  He noted specifically that his desire to learn 
more about the Bahai community in Iran was met with a the 
response from Iranian president Ahmadinijad that, 
occasionally, the Bahai faith was used as cover for Israeli 
intelligence officers.  With respect to the Third Committee, 
Gonsalves said that, in principle, he had no problem with 
debate, and that his instinct was to allow an open discussion 
of all issues. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Separately, FM Straker agreed generally with the 
points expressed verbally and via non-paper, but reminded CDA 
that the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines (GOSVG) 
was developing relations with Iran.  "You know our 
situation," he said, alluding to the GOSVG's attempts to 
garner financial support from Iran and other countries for 
the ongoing Argyle International Airport construction 
project.  This effort to secure funding -- which had yet to 
bear fruit -- prompted the GOSVG to shift its vote on the 
substantive Iran resolution from in favor to abstention last 
year, and Straker's comment made clear this was not likely to 
change as long as there was a chance of securing Iranian 
financial support for the government's signature project.
