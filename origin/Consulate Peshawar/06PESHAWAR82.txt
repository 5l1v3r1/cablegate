 SUBJECT: GOP/ARMY RELATIONS IN WAZIRISTAN 
 
REF: (A)  05 PESHAWAR 472  (B)  05 PESHAWAR 482 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Michael Spangler, Principal Officer, Amconsul 
Peshawar, State. 
REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 
 
¶1.  (C)  A window on GOP and Pakistan Army relations in 
Waziristan recently opened during a meeting with Federally 
Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) senior secretary Arbab Shahzad. 
 In response to our low-key request for meetings with visiting 
FATA Political Agents (PA's), Shahzad noted such meetings, once 
publicly known, could undermine the reputation of the Agents as 
fair and impartial actors in the FATA.  He emphasized the PA's 
--especially of North and South Waziristan -- are under standing 
instructions from NWFP Governor Khalilur Rehman to remain aloof 
even from Pakistan Army discussions and activities.  He added 
this instruction enhanced their reputation as unbiased arbiters 
who can thus enter more effectively into difficult tribal 
negotiations. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Reminded of our common agenda and the confidentiality 
of our meetings, Shahzad asserted more frequent PA meetings 
could not be kept confidential and would play into the hands of 
extremists who assert the GOP is acting as an agent of the USG 
rather than in its own interest in the FATA.  However, he 
volunteered to continue convening PA meetings for senior USG 
officials and special NAS and USAID program needs, but then only 
in the presence of his staff to ensure ""we are all on the same 
page.""  We replied this issue might be revisited. 
 
¶3.  (C)  COMMENT:  In light of ongoing security problems in 
Waziristan (REF A) and the GOP's commitment to work closely with 
the Pakistan Army in promoting development there, we did not 
expect to hear Political Agents have been instructed not to 
participate actively in Army activities.  Reports of increasing 
friction between Army officers and the PA civil servants in 
Waziristan appear accurate, but the actual causes remain veiled. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Perhaps, Governor Rehman and his staff feel they are 
being increasingly relegated to unimportant tasks under the 
thumb of Army officers, after the North Waziristan agent was 
removed for corruption last autumn (REF B) and the South 
Waziristan Agent was recently replaced for a second time since 
last summer.  On the other hand, the apparent friction may stem 
from a genuine Secretariat concern that Army initiatives are 
being mismanaged.  Whether a serious policy disagreement or a 
petty turf fight, Governor Rehman's staff appears to be on the 
sidelines in Waziristan and does not want PA's to trade regular 
notes with us. END COMMENT.
