Affairs Mohammed Aini told us March 13 that Malaysia would 
not attend the March 13-15 meeting in Jeddah of the liaison 
officers of the Islamic Office for the Boycott of Israel.  He 
said that Malaysia had not participated in past such meetings 
and saw no need to participate at this time.  The Malaysian 
mission in Saudi Arabia had been instructed not to send a 
representative, Aini said. (Note: Malaysia is currently the 
chair of the OIC.)  Separately, the Malaysian DCM in 
Washington informed EAP/MTS that his embassy had recommended 
that Malaysia not attend the meeting (ref B).
