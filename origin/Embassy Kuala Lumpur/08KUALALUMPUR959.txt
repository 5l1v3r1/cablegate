SUBJECT: COURT ACQUITS NAJIB'S EX-ADVISOR IN MURDER TRIAL 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Mark D. Clark for reasons 1.4 (b and 
 d). 
 
Summary and Comment 
------------------- 
¶1.  (SBU) High Court Justice Mohamad Zaki on October 31 
acquitted Political Analyst Abdul Razak Baginda, former 
advisor to Deputy Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak, of the 
charge of abetting the murder of Mongolian national Altantuya 
Shaariibuu in October 2006, but ordered the continuation of 
the murder trial for two policemen.  Defense lawyers 
announced they sought to call to the stand two men who have 
linked DPM Najib to the case:  Razak's former private 
investigator Balasubramaniam, who has disappeared from 
public, and controversial blogger Raja Petra who is detained 
under the Internal Security Act.  The trial of the two police 
defendants is set to continue November 10.  In immediate 
commentary, political opposition leaders, including Anwar 
Ibrahim, did not focus on Razak's guilt or innocence, but 
called into question the conduct of the proceedings and 
suggested a cover-up to protect DPM Najib. 
 
¶2.  (C) Comment:  Many observers anticipated Razak's 
acquittal given the prosecution's poor performance, Razak's 
connections to DPM Najib, and the alleged and 
widely-perceived political manipulation in the case.  The 
Razak verdict momentarily attracts more attention to the 
allegations of Najib's linkages to the case; so too would the 
testimony of either Balasubramaniam or Raja Petra, though it 
is not clear either man will be able to take the stand. 
Allegations stemming from the Altantuya case, however, have 
not prevented Najib from securing all the nominations so far 
for the UMNO party elections.  Absent dramatic and compelling 
new evidence prejudicial to the DPM, the Altantuya case will 
not slow down Najib's drive to become Malaysia's next Prime 
Minister.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
Razak Acquitted, Trial for Policemen Continues 
--------------------------------------------- - 
¶3.  (U) High Court Justice Mohamad Zaki on October 31 
acquitted Political Analyst Abdul Razak Baginda, former 
advisor to Deputy Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak, of charges 
of abetting the murder of Mongolian national Altantuya 
Shaariibuu in October 2006, but ordered the continuation of 
the murder trial for two policemen.  Embassy FSN Political 
Assistant attended the judgment hearing.  The ruling came 
roughly two years after Razak's arrest, and followed a 
lengthy 17-month trial involving the presentation of 84 
witnesses.  The prosecution had argued that Razak had asked 
the policemen to murder Altantuya, Razak's former lover who 
had harassed Razak for money.  The judge ruled that the 
prosecution team failed to prove a prima facie case against 
Razak, and ordered his release.  The judge found a 
sufficiently strong prosecution case against the two police 
defendants, Chief Inspector Azilah Hadri and Corporal Sirul 
Azha Umar, charged with carrying out Altantuya's murder.  At 
the time of the crime, Azilah and Azha were members of the 
protection detail for DPM Najib. 
 
Defense to Call Controversial Witnesses 
--------------------------------------- 

¶4.  (U) The Justice requested the defense to begin their 
arguments later on the afternoon of October 31, but the 
defense requested and was granted a continuance as their 
witnesses were not available.  In the day's most surprising 
turn, Kamarul Hisham, lead defense counsel for one of the 
accused police officers, stated he wished to place on the 
witness chair Razak's private investigator P. Balasubramaniam 
and Malaysia Today editor Raja Petra Kamaruddin.  Both 
witnesses have previously made sworn statements linking DPM 
Najib to the murdered Altantuya, and in the case of Raja 
Petra, implicating Najib's wife in the murder. 
Balasubramaniam, who was an early witness for the 
prosecution, has not been seen publicly since he issued a 
sworn statement in July on DPM Najib's links to the Altantuya 
case, and then retracted the statement the next day, 
allegedly under duress according to some accounts.  Raja 
Petra is currently detained under the Internal Security Act 
(ISA).  (Note: Although the court may order Raja Petra's 
presence as a witness, Section 18 of the ISA gives the Home 
Minister discretion to ignore the court order.  End note.) 
The Judge set November 10 for the defense to begin its 
presentation. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) For the October 31 judgment hearing, a crowd of 
approximately 200 waited outside the courthouse while some 
100 (primarily family members of the defendants and 
journalists) filled the packed courtroom.  Razak's family 
appeared confident and remained calm throughout the whole 
hearing and showed no sign of surprise in Razak's acquittal. 
The verdict also appeared to come as no surprise to the 
attending crowd.  The victim's father, Setev Shaariibuu, 
attended the judgment and afterward through an interpreter 
expressed his disappointment to reporters:  "I am not 
satisfied.  My daughter (knew) only one Malaysian and that is 
Razak Baginda.  Now my daughter is dead and Baginda is freed. 
 The country (Malaysia) has lost credibility..." 
 
Opposition Suggests Cover-Up 
---------------------------- 
¶6.  (U) In immediate comments, political opposition figures, 
who have suggested repeatedly that the government had engaged 
in a cover-up to protect DPM Najib, did not focus on Razak's 
guilt or innocence, but called into question the conduct of 
the proceedings.  Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim noted, "On 
a personal level, I wish Razak Baginda well, but the issue 
here resolves around the court procedure and investigations. 
There is a general and growing perception that the 
investigation was not done professionally, that there is a 
clear motive to cover up."  Anwar also drew attention to 
recent Internet revelations of an SMS exchange between Najib 
and Razak Baginda's former lawyer in which Najib reportedly 
wrote that Razak "will face a tentative charge but all is not 
lost."
