Summary and Comment 
------------------- 
 
¶1.  (C) Embattled Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi claimed 
support from state-level officials of his ruling United 
Malays National Organization (UMNO) for his re-nomination as 
party president, in an effort to bounce back after some 
national UMNO leaders on September 18 urged the PM not to 
contest in the December party poll.  Subsequently, Abdullah 
again affirmed his commitment to seek reelection together 
with Deputy Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak, while other 
senior UMNO leaders reiterated calls for Abdullah to step 
down.  On September 22, Anwar's camp spread news that the 
Opposition leader would meet the King the following day; we 
have no information to suggest such a meeting took place.  PM 
Abdullah said reports that he was in indirect talks with 
Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim over a transfer of power were 
"rubbish;" Anwar also issued a public denial and advocated 
caution. 
 
¶2.  (C) Comment:  Rapidly approaching the Muslim holiday 
period beginning October 1-2, and the October 9 start of the 
party's divisional meetings, the UMNO leadership crisis 
remains critical and unresolved.  Reports of Anwar Ibrahim 
meeting the King or opening up a third-party channel to 
negotiate with PM Abdullah do not appear credible.  Anwar's 
most recent pronouncements sound a cautious tone and avoid 
setting deadlines for bringing down Abdullah's government, 
and it is unclear how far Anwar Ibrahim can push his agenda 
before the end of September.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
Abdullah Claims State-Level Backing 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) PM Abdullah traveled to Perak and Kelantan states 
and held meetings with some UMNO state-level leaders over the 
September 20-21 weekend in an attempt to regroup support for 
his re-nomination as UMNO president following his setback in 
the heated UMNO Supreme Council meeting on September 18. 
(Note:  Some prominent UMNO national leaders during the 
September 18 meeting reportedly warned Abdullah he would not 
get sufficient nominations from the UMNO party divisions and 
urged him not to seek reelection in the December party polls, 
ref A.  End Note.)  On September 23, Abdullah held a late 
night meeting with the UMNO liaison chiefs from nine states, 
with Johor, Sabah and Terangganu not represented (along with 
Sarawak, which does not have an UMNO branch).  Following the 
meeting, a senior aide to Abdullah told reporters that the 
Prime Minister had received the strong endorsement of the 
party's state chiefs for his transition plan, which involves 
PM Abdullah and DPM Najib's reelection in December, and 
transfer of power from Abdullah to Najib by June 2010.  Other 
UMNO participants in the meeting noted a "unanimous" decision 
in favor of the 2010 transition plan. 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment:  By going to the state level, and reporting 
strong endorsement from state leaders, Abdullah sought to 
counter criticism from national leaders that he would not 
receive sufficient backing for his reelection.  State liaison 
chiefs are appointed by the party president -- Abdullah -- 
and thus largely beholden to him, but they also exercise 
important political power among their respective state's 
party divisions.  End Comment. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) After remaining awkwardly quiet on September 19, 
the Prime Minister's spin machine operating through the 
mainstream media and some on-line news portals, like The 
Malaysian Insider, started up again on September 20. 
Reporting from government sources and associated commentary 
reaffirmed that Abdullah was moving ahead with the joint 
ticket with Najib, and that the transition plan remained on 
track and was not likely to be derailed. 
 
Open UMNO Split Continues 
------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) As Abdullah reaffirmed his transition plan and 
intention to seek reelection, senior UMNO leaders Muhyiddin 
Yassin and Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah adamantly stuck to their 
positions that Abdullah should step down by December.  On 
September 23, Razaleigh issued a lengthy condemnation of 
UMNO's undemocratic power politics and the party's failure to 
reform:  "We cannot afford to allow these disturbing trends 
to play out their destructive course while we suffer a de 
facto leadership vacuum..." (full text forwarded to EAP/MTS). 
 DPM Najib, who departs the evening of September 24 for the 
UN General Assembly, largely avoided comment, feeding local 
perceptions that he is attempting to keep some room open to 
receive party nominations for president, possibly with 
Muhyiddin as his number two.  Former Prime Minister Mahathir 
continued his attacks against Abdullah, and heaped blame on 
Najib for facilitating Abdullah's continuation in office. 
 
Opposition Rumors; Anwar's Caution 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) Beginning September 22, Opposition leader Anwar 
Ibrahim's camp circulated two streams of rumor in what - in 
the absence of more information - appears to be a 
continuation of psychological warfare against UMNO and the 
National Front (BN) government.  On September 22, Anwar 
advisor Khalid Jaafar whispered to us during a reception at 
the Ambassador's Residence that Anwar would meet the King on 
September 23 to discuss the parliamentary majority that Anwar 
alleges he now has and the formation of a new government. 
Other rumors of Anwar meeting with the King and other Royals 
persist in Kuala Lumpur. 
 
¶8.  (C) On September 23, Tian Chua, Anwar's information 
chief, publicly announced that the Opposition had opened 
negotiations with Prime Minister Abdullah through a 
third-party channel.  PM Abdullah immediately dismissed this 
claim, calling it "rubbish."  Anwar later issued a statement 
referring to Tian Chua's remarks as "misinformed."  Avoiding 
setting any new deadlines for toppling the government, Anwar 
in his statement said, "We will proceed cautiously towards 
our goals and we agree neither to be provoked into hasty 
action nor to take an irresponsible approach that would lead 
to instability and greater uncertainty in the country." 
(Comment:  Earlier on September 23, the GOM confirmed two 
years detention without trial under the Internal Security Act 
for controversial blogger Raja Petra, septel.  Opposition 
leaders continue to tell us that they seek to avoid creating 
a pretext for the government to arrest them under the ISA. 
End Comment.)
