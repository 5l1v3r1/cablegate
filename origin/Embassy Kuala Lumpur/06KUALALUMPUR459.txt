The MFA informed us March 14 that the GOM was not prepared to 
provide end-use assurances for RAM missiles from Germany, as 
required by the USG for sale or transfer to Malaysia (ref C). 
 We were told that the Ministry of Defense had determined 
that the missiles were "not compatible" with existing 
systems, and that the GOM would not seek to purchase the 
missiles.
