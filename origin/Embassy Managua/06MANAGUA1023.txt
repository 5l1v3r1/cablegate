¶1. (C) Poloff met with local UNDP official Felipe Molina on 
May 5 to discuss the UNDP's five-year, $5 million project to 
reduce small arms in Central America.  Molina explained that 
the plan will cover "all types of weapons transportable by 
one person" -- including MANPADS.  "Arms in poor countries 
are a handicap, and armies should be proportional to the 
economy of the country," he stated.  Molina claimed that UNDP 
would like to see the complete elimination of MANPADS in 
Central America, but acknowledged that the GON is lobbying to 
address MANPADS only in the context of regional arms 
reduction.  He noted that the inclusion of MANPADS in the 
UNDP plan could "de-politicize" the MANPADS debate to some 
extent and re-focus the discussion on technical issues. 
Molina said that most of the funds from the project are 
coming from the UNDP, though the European Union, United 
Kingdom, and Sweden are contributing money.  Molina also 
mentioned that ex-Nicaraguan Minister of Defense Jose Adan 
Guerra has submitted his resume for consideration as the 
Director General of the project. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Post welcomes Guerra's bid for the Director 
Generalship of the UNDP's Central American small arms 
reduction program.  As Nicaraguan Minister of Defense, Guerra 
was highly supportive of USG policies, including MANPADS 
destruction.  As Director General of this regional project, 
Guerra indicated in an April 19 meeting with the Ambassador 
that he would continue to be responsive to USG concerns 
(reftel).  End Comment. 
 
¶3. (C) Molina, after commenting that UNDP has received over 
70 applications for three executive positions for the 
program, acknowledged that Guerra is a "strong contender." 
He noted that Guerra has strong relations with the Nicaraguan 
Army, the USG, and other Ministers of Defense in the region. 
May 18 is the deadline to receive applications, and a special 
committee will select candidates for the positions of 
Director General, Operations Coordinator, and Arms Specialist 
on May 22.  The special committee is composed of the 
following individuals: 
 
- Marc Andre Franche, Director of Arms Control for Latin 
America (UN, New York) 
- Peter Bachelor, Director of the small arms unit (UN, Geneva) 
- Alfredo Missair, Director of UNDP in Nicaragua 
- Maria Carmen Sacasa, UNDP Nicaragua 
- Mauricio Gomez, Nicaraguan Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
- Eric Vilchez, SICA (El Salvador)
