REF: SECSTATE 26136 
 
(SBU) On Thursday, March 26, 2009, during a previously 
scheduled meeting with Ministry of Foreign Relations (MINREX) 
Director for American Affairs Renee Morales and Political 
Analyst Jane Mary Rivera we delivered points as instructed 
per REFTEL.  We reviewed points of the nonpaper and left a 
Spanish-language translation.  We also left Spanish-language 
versions of the invitation letter, sample diplomatic note and 
logistics information sheet.  Morales said she would pass 
information to Vice Foreign Minister Manuel Coronel Kautz who 
holds overall responsibility at MINREX for international 
security issues.  Morales also noted the mention of the "PSI 
SOP" in the sample diplomatic note and asked whether a copy 
of the SOP could be made available for MINREX to review.
