SUBJECT: FSLN CENSUS AN ATTEMPT TO MAP OPPOSITION LEADERS, 
DRAW THEM WITH FALSE PROMISES, CLAIMS MISKITO LEADER 
(C-AL7-00063) 
 
REF: MANAGUA 0385 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Miskito leader Osorno Coleman, who lost his bid for a 
National Assembly seat on the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance 
(ALN) ticket in November 2006, is convinced that 
pro-Sandinista (FSLN) Miskito leaders Brooklyn Rivera and 
Stedman Fagoth are directing an FSLN "census" of 
ex-combatants on the Atlantic Coast.  The pair are using the 
pretext that respondents will soon receive generous 
indemnification for their suffering and sacrifice during 
Nicaragua's 1980s civil war.  Coleman, a former Contra 
commander also known as "Comandante Blas," reported to 
PolCouns on March 23 that Rivera and Fagoth are assuring 
Miskitos the U.S. government will abide by the International 
Court of Justice's 1980s ruling in favor of Nicaragua's suit 
against the United States. 
 
¶2.  (C) According to Coleman, FSLN leaders are claiming that 
part of the compensation from The Hague decision will be 
given to the Miskitos for their suffering.  Moreover, they 
are attempting to convince the Miskito population that the 
U.S. is to blame for Nicaragua's 1980s civil war.  Coleman 
added that Rivera and Fagoth are also spreading the rumor 
that the U.S. will contribute $300 million to the Nicaraguan 
government's Peace and Reconciliation Commission led by 
Ortega loyalist Cardinal Obando y Bravo.  (Note: President 
Ortega has publicly called on the United States to contribute 
$300 million towards the Peace and Reconciliation Commission 
to compensate the Contras who fought for the United States.) 
 
 
¶3.  (C) Coleman explained that he wanted to confirm his 
suspicions that the Sandinistas' assurances of compensation 
are mere rumors that they are exploiting to "map" the 
experience and current whereabouts of ex-combatants as a 
means to control them.  He clarified that although a 
$300-million fund to help the Contras would be very helpful, 
placing the funds in the hands of the Sandinistas would be a 
disaster, as it would serve only to bolster their popularity. 
 PolCouns, who confirmed that these are indeed 
Sandinista-generated rumors, clarified that soon after 
Violeta Chamorro assumed the presidency, the Nicaraguan 
government withdrew its case and that it is a non-issue that 
the FSLN has revived -- possibly in an effort find the monies 
it needs to deliver on its campaign promises and possibly to 
stir nationalistic sentiments. 
 
¶4.  (C) Coleman promised to disseminate the facts to the 
Miskitos.  He also mentioned his plans to write a book on the 
true story of the Miskito struggle against the 1980s 
Sandinista regime and solicited our ideas for funding the 
project.  (Note: Coleman forwarded an outline of his book on 
March 25.  He is seeking $2,000 to defray some of the 
expenses associated with his book.)
