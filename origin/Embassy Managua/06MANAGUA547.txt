SUBJECT: NICARAGUA WILL TRY TO ATTEND CARTAGENA PROTOCOL ON 
BIOSAFETY MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 34706 
 
On March 7, the Ambassador delivered talking points in REFTEL 
to Foreign Minister Norman Caldera.  Caldera told the 
Ambassador that the GON understands our concerns over 
attempts to introduce restrictive biosecurity requirements. 
While the Minister did not commit to sending a representative 
to the Third Meeting of the Parties (MOP3) to the Cartegena 
Protocol on Biosafety being held in Curitiba, Brazil from 
March 13-17, the Minister said that his government often 
sends a representative to these types of meetings and will 
make every effort to do so again.  (Comment: The GON has been 
very proactive in working to defeat non-science based, 
anti-GMO "biosecurity" legislation over the last several 
months.  End Comment).
