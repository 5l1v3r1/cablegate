Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
(S) On April 20, Ambassador revisited with Nicaraguan Foreign 
Minister Norman Caldera the possible resettlement of part, or 
all of, the 16 Uighur men of Chinese nationality that the USG 
has in detention at Guantanamo.  Caldera replied that he has 
not finished discussing the matter with all Nicaraguan 
parties that would be involved; he voiced concern, however 
that the Uighurs could become an economic burden in 
Nicaragua, a poor country with high unemployment.  Caldera 
suggested that perhaps the GON could accept some of the 
Uighurs, who perhaps could work in the Free Trade Zone where 
several Taiwanese companies operate.  Ambassador noted that 
some of the men speak Mandarin and would have a common 
language with the Taiwanese.  He provided biographical 
information on the Uighurs, noting that some have experience 
in the clothing and shoe industries, which could be of use to 
the Free Trade Zone's clothing industries.  Caldera will 
continue his rounds of consultations with the proper 
Nicaraguan authorities and with the director of the Free 
Trade Zone.  (Comment: Some sort of monetary support for 
resettlement might prompt the GON to accept a few of the 
Uighurs.  End Comment.)
