SUBJECT: LIBERAL FORUM MEMBERS TELL DAS MADISON THAT 
MONTEALEGRE IS THE BEST CANDIDATE, BUT DIVERGE OVER HIS 
CHANCES TO BEAT ORTEGA 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Liberal Forum (Foro Liberal) members, who dined with 
DAS Madison, USAID DAA Magan and Ambassador on April 24, 
agree that Liberal dissident Eduardo Montealegre is the 
brightest and best-suited candidate to lead Nicaragua. 
However, they diverge over whether he can beat Daniel Ortega 
in the November presidential election.  While Forum members 
Adolfo Arguello, FOGADE director Vilma Rosa Leon-York, and 
Marco Mayorga unequivocally endorsed Montealegre's candidacy, 
Juan Sacasa and Luis DeBayle asserted that Liberal 
Constitutional Party (PLC) candidate Jose Rizo is a safer bet 
because the PLC possesses the political machinery required to 
win an election.  They also argued that Rizo will distance 
himself from PLC caudillo/convicted money launderer Arnoldo 
Aleman once Rizo wins the November election. 
 
¶2.  (C) Madison and Ambassador questioned the assumptions 
that Rizo is more likely to win the November 5 election, or 
that if elected, he will marginalize Aleman.  Madison 
reminded the group of the Department's recent statement 
condemning the Ortega-Aleman pact and equating Rizo's 
candidacy with Aleman's continued control of the PLC.  In 
essence, a vote for Rizo is a vote for Aleman and for the 
Ortega-Aleman pact, and not a winning ticket when polls show 
that most Nicaraguans oppose Ortega and the pact and that 
Rizo himself is not a draw, she said.  DAA Magan also noted 
that the much-vaunted PLC machinery had not done particularly 
well in the municipal and Atlantic Coast elections. 
 
¶3.  (C)  On the margins of the dinner, DeBayle advised 
Ambassador that Nicaraguan capital will likely provide 
campaign funds to both to Montealegre and the PLC -- to 
Montealegre because they think he is the best option for 
Nicaragua's future -- and to the PLC because it will likely 
win a sizeable number of Assembly seats.  DeBayle explained 
that, in return for its support for the PLC, the private 
sector will select ten Assembly candidates of its liking -- 
independent business types who need not rely on a lawmaker's 
salary to feed their families -- to run for office.  (Note: 
Carlos Pellas, a relative and business partner of both Sacasa 
and DeBalye, recently informed the Ambassador that Nicaraguan 
financiers will also hire an outside polling firm to 
determine whether Montealegre or Rizo can draw more votes.)
