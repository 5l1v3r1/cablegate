Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) National Assembly lawmaker Delia Arellano has left 
the Camino Cristiano party to join Eduardo Montealegre's 
National Liberal Alliance-Conservative (ALN-PC) caucus, 
making the formal announcement to the press on March 20. 
With Arellano, the ALN-PC (Ref. D) now encompasses eight 
deputies.  Arellano, who chairs the Assembly's Defense and 
Governance Committee, related to us on March 21 that she is 
pleased with her decision.  She also opined that Montealegre 
is the only candidate capable of breaking the Ortega-Aleman 
caudillo pact. 
 
¶2.  (U) Biodata:  Delia Arellano Sandoval is a lawyer with a 
master's degree in private sector law from the University of 
Barcelona, Spain and an education degree from the Autonomous 
University of Nicaragua (UNAN) in Leon, Nicaragua.  After she 
left her teaching career, Arellano was director of electoral 
affairs and adviser to the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) 
from 1989-1997.  She has also represented the Camino 
Cristiano party (CCN) on the National Council of Economic and 
Social Planning (CONPES) and has headed the CCN's female 
secretariat.  She was elected Assembly Deputy in 2001 on a 
 
SIPDIS 
PLC-CCN-National Resistance Party (PRN) ticket. 
 
¶3.  (C) Comment:  In addition to Arellano, Embassy has 
encouraged three other Assembly deputies to "make the leap" 
to the ALN-PC: Augustin Valle, Bladimir Pineda, and Alfonso 
Ortega Urbina (Refs. C, E, F).  In light of the Liberal 
Constitutional Party's (PLC) relative success in the March 5 
Atlantic Coast elections (Refs. A, B), we do not expect more 
deputies to join Montealegre's party until after the PLC's 
April 2 convention to select its presidential candidate. 
Depending on the convention outcome, additional PLC deputies 
-- and possibly one or two from minor blocs -- could also 
join Montealegre's caucus.  End Comment.
