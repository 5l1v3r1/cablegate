¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On August 18, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) carried out massive firings at the Ministry of the Family (MIFAMILIA), decimating the units responsible for adoptions and the welfare of children. Post fears that cooperation with the GON will deteriorate on adoptions and sensitive child welfare cases as a result. End Summary.
 
¶2. (SBU) On August 20, a U.S. citizen reported to the Consular 
Section that he could not locate anyone at MIFAMILIA.  He said he 
had been told that morning that MIFAMILIA was in transition and that 
no one would be available to speak with him until the following 
week.  Post immediately reached out to MIFAMILIA contacts who 
confirmed that approximately 30 staff members in the Department of 
Special Attention for Children had received job termination letters. 
 Post's two primary contacts were among those dismissed -- Arle 
Martinez, Director General of Special Attention for Children, and 
Ivonne Ibarra, Director of the Office of Children's Issues.  As 
trained social workers, both had consistently rendered assistance to 
the U.S. Embassy on sensitive adoption and child abuse cases. 
They reported that staff members were in shock at the mass firings 
that had targeted trained social workers.  Many had thought they 
would be immune from the mass dismissals that had affected other 
government ministries following Ortega's return to power in 2007 as 
reported reftels. 
 
¶3. (SBU) While local media were initially slow to cover the MIFAMILIA shake-up, "Bolsa de Noticias," a left-of-center daily newsletter, reported on August 20 that Maria Isabel Munoz had been dismissed as Minister at MIFAMILIA and replaced by Mayling Calero, the former Vice Minister of the Tourism Institute (INTUR) and the current Deputy Political Secretary of the FSLN party. NOTE: Calero recently received heavy media exposure when local newspaper published photos of her directing a group of government-affiliated thugs that attacked peaceful protesters near the National Cathedral. Days after the incident, several National Assembly members and NGOs demanded Calero's immediate resignation. Her appointment as Minister of MIFAMILIA has been seen by many as her "reward" for loyal service to the FSLN. END NOTE.
 
¶4. (SBU) The mainstream press has also covered the MIFAMILIA changes over the last few days. Articles focused on the irregularities of Calero's appointment, noting that several Assembly members have accused Ortega of violating Nicaragua's Constitution by appointing this new minister without first seeking ratification by the National Assembly. Human rights groups cite the appointment of Calero -- given her recent key role in directing anti-democratic violence -- as a defiant provocation by Ortega, demonstrating his lack of respect for Nicaragua's people and institutions.
 
¶5. (SBU) One of MIFAMILIA's recently dismissed legal advisors 
informed post that rumors had been circulating internally for months 
that the GON planned to resurrect the 1980s structure of the 
Nicaraguan Institute for Social Security and Welfare (INSSBI: 
Instituto Nicaraguense de Seguridad Social y Bienestar), which would 
have the net effect of subsuming MIFAMILIA under the umbrella of 
Nicaragua's Institute for Social Security (INSS), which runs the 
state's pension and medical insurance systems.  Ivonne Solis 
confirmed that the Deputy Director of INSS, Dr. Roberto Lopez, a 
retired military physician and high-level member of the FSLN party, 
had slowly assumed many of the functions previously performed by 
MIFAMILIA.  She added that he had served as an INSS representative 
on the Nicaraguan Adoption Council for the last year. She said that 
MIFAMILIA employees kept silent out of fear that the GON would take 
action against them should this transition be made public. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Contacts also confirmed media reports that the GON was linking the MIFAMILIA dismissals to alleged irregularities in "Program Amor". Program Amor, inaugurated in 2007 by First Lady Rosario Murillo, was designed to reintegrate abandoned children into society through educational and social projects focused on extended family networks rather than through formal adoption. GON officials have reportedly told those still working at MIFAMILIA that those dismissed were engaged in corruption and the selling of children. Ivonne Solis told post that she believes the GON will likely pursue trumped-up charges against her and other fired employees to avoid paying severance and to justify the illegal firings. Irregularities in Nicaraguan adoptions previously toppled high-level MIFAMILIA officials in 2007 when Pedro Siero, the former Director General of Special Attention for Children, confessed to local media that he accepted money from a Spanish couple in exchange for expediting an adoption.
 
¶7. (SBU) These recent firings leave many U.S. citizen families 
without the support of a host government authority to process 
adoption cases and pursue allegations of child abuse.  Post is 
currently working with MIFAMILIA on five children's issues cases 
involving nine U.S. citizen children, five of whom were brought to 
Nicaragua by non-custodial parents.  Four additional children are in 
foster homes under the custody of MIFAMILIA, two of them allegedly 
victims of rape.  On the adoption front, three U.S. citizen families 
are currently fostering Nicaraguan children in Managua awaiting 
their final adoption court judgments.  Six more families are on the 
cusp of starting the mandatory fostering process in preparation for 
final adoption and nine families recently filed adoption requests 
with the Nicaraguan adoption council.  Post is aware of 55 U.S. 
citizen families who have pending adoption cases with MIFAMILIA. 
 
¶8. (SBU) COMMENT.  Post will continue to track the situation at 
MIFAMILIA carefully over the next few weeks, providing support and 
information to U.S. citizen families and modifying the adoption 
flyer for Nicaragua if cooperation does indeed appear to deteriorate 
or cease altogether.  The fear is that Rosario Murillo will make 
real her threat upon inaugurating Program Amor that formal adoptions 
should cease altogether in favor of informal extended family 
arrangements.  END COMMENT.
