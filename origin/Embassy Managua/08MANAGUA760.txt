REF: STATE 57319 
 
¶1. (U) On June 11, Post delivered talking points on USG priorities 
for the International Whaling Commission (IWC) Meeting to INPESCA 
Executive President Stedman Fagoth.  Fagoth was recently appointed 
the Nicaraguan Commissioner to the IWC and anticipates his 
attendance at the June 23 annual meeting in Santiago, Chile. 
Sandinista (FSLN) National Assembly Deputy Edwin Castro is Alternate 
Commissioner. 
 
¶2. (U) Fagoth described Nicaragua's policy on whaling in general 
terms, emphasizing Nicaragua's longstanding position against whale 
hunting, and its commitment to environmental stewardship and 
sustainable development.  He did not specifically address any of the 
main IWC priorities of reducing research whaling, establishing a 
South Atlantic sanctuary, or small-type Japanese coastal whaling. 
Nor did he offer comments on the specific USG priority of 
establishing small working groups, their size, or representation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Fagoth mentioned that environmentalist groups are 
pressuring the government to maintain its anti-whaling stance, while 
the Japanese are actively lobbying him to change Nicaragua's 
position.  Nicaragua is the recipient of Japanese assistance, and 
this was the reason Fagoth gave why Nicaragua will listen to Japan's 
proposals and might shift its position more favorably toward their 
perspective.  Fagoth will meet with his interagency on the issue, 
and then with President Ortega before departing for Chile.
