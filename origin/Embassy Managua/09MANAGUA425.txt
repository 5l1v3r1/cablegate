SUBJECT: PRESIDENT ORTEGA: OBAMA IS A LIAR, THREATENS TO 
EXPEL U.S. DIPLOMATS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Robert J. Callahan for reasons 1.4 (b & d). 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary: During an April 22 appearance on a Cuban 
talk show, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega discredited the 
Summit of the Americas (SOA) and stated that President Obama 
lied because he talked about change, but had maintained the 
Bush policies of freezing the Millennium Challenge Account 
for Nicaragua and leaving US troops in Iraq.  Moreover, 
Ortega claimed that the US government was conspiring against 
him, that he was collecting information of this conspiracy, 
and threatened to expel US Embassy diplomats in the future. 
Ortega's comments were not limited to foreign affairs, 
stating his preference for a single party system.  A 
multiparty system, he argued, served to divide the populace. 
End Summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
Obama a Liar, Summit a Failure 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During his appearance on the Cuban talk show "Mesa 
Redonda" on April 22, President Ortega spoke for 
approximately two hours.  He spoke at length on the Summit of 
the Americas and countered the generally positive news 
coverage of President Obama.  Ortega described the President 
as a carrier of the same "imperialistic" policies and 
believed the President "went to the Summit to strengthen the 
empire."   Ortega argued that despite the President's 
comments, the President was trapped in the past and said the 
President demonstrated that he lies.  While the President 
spoke of change, Ortega commented, the Obama Administration 
had continued Bush Administration decisions to keep 
Nicaragua's Millennium Challenge Account compact frozen and 
US troops in Iraq. 
 
¶3.  (U) Ortega also argued that the Summit was organized 
around the U.S. President, who was treated as an "emperor." 
Ortega noted his annoyance at having to wait three hours on 
the tarmac at Port of Spain airport while President Obama and 
his delegation arrived and debarked from their three planes. 
Ortega said this "showed a lack of respect" for the other 
regional leaders.  Ortega then characterized the other 
regional leaders' interaction with the President as the rats 
that had followed Obama's "Pied Piper of Hamlin."  In a 
reference to local criticism of Ortega's domestic limits on 
freedom of speech, Ortega criticized the Summit of the 
Americas and said that the Summit had practiced censorship in 
allowing only a handful of leaders to speak publicly during 
the opening ceremony.  As in past remarks, Ortega questioned 
the utility of the OAS and suggested the creation of a new 
organization for Latin America and the Caribbean. 
 
---------------------------------- 
The U.S. Conspiracy Against Ortega 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Following his criticisms of the President and the 
Summit of the Americas, Ortega turned his sights on the U.S. 
Embassy in Managua and his view of the USG policy toward 
Nicaragua.  "In my country," Ortega stated "officials from 
the (U.S.) embassy are conspiring (against the Nicaraguan 
government).  We have not wanted to expel them, we have 
sought to collect more information, and at the appropriate 
moment we will make it public."  Embassy officials, he 
continued, were continually conspiring against his government 
by meeting with the opposition, financing the opposition's 
activities, and calling on the opposition to unite against 
Ortega.  "We have not yet asked any one to leave," he said, 
alluding to the possibility of future action on the part of 
his government. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Ortega also spoke directly of the Ambassador.  He 
said that despite appearing to be diplomatic and respectful, 
the American Ambassador had been an advisor to former Deputy 
Secretary of State Negroponte when Negroponte had been U.S. 
Ambassador in Honduras in the 1980s.  Ortega said he hoped 
that Ambassador Callahan was no longer "an agent of war and 
destabilization." 
 
------------------------- 
A Single Party Works Best 
------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Ortega did not limit himself to foreign affairs. 
Allegedly recalling the statements of Ecuadorian President 
Rafael Correa, Ortega asserted that "elections weren't 
necessarily a sign of democracy."  Then, perhaps signaling 
his own goal for Nicaragua, Ortega attacked multiparty 
systems.  He lauded Cuba's "democracy" because the people 
were not divided by a multiparty system.  "From the moment 
you bring about political parties, you bring about division. 
A multiparty system is just a way of disintegrating a nation, 
of dividing our people."  Ortega continued, "Cuba has a 
system that does not cause division among the people.  (In 
Cuba) the focus is on the citizen without the party banners 
or campaigns run by big business, nor opulent elections." 
 
---------------------------- 
Ortega's Possible Motivation 
---------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) Ortega's speeches are always a treat, as he is likely 
to say anything and everything.  What is unclear, however, is 
his motivation as he is not driven by a strict political 
ideology.  Rather, according to Victor Hugo Tinoco, a former 
FSLN member who served as Nicaraguan permanent representative 
to the UN and as Vice Foreign Minister during the first 
Ortega Administration in the 1980s, Ortega always has had a 
special interest in foreign affairs and a desire for a role 
on the international stage.  As to the widely held belief 
that Ortega plays bad cop to Hugo Chavez' good cop on the 
international stage, Tinoco commented that Ortega was not 
stupid and likely accepted this role in exchange for promises 
of Venezuelan assistance. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  (C) It is never clear why Ortega says what he says.  As 
former Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Norman Caldera noted 
regarding Ortega's policies, "when you do not know where you 
are going, any road will take you there."  Nonetheless, 
Ortega's remarks were a glimpse at his current thinking.  His 
rants against the US are not new and are likely to continue. 
This has been especially true since his government has 
received constant international and national criticism for 
Nicaragua's fraudulent November 2008 municipal elections. 
His pointed comments on a US plot against him and his threat 
to expel US diplomats were the clearest to date.  Since the 
expulsion of the US ambassadors to Caracas and La Paz, 
Nicaraguans often have wondered if Ortega would follow Evo 
Morales and Hugo Chavez' lead and expel a US diplomat. 
Ortega's remarks likely were motivated in part by his desire 
(and need) to defend his government's increasingly 
authoritarian tendencies.  As Tinoco stated, Ortega's 
interest in grandstanding on the international stage also 
likely contributed to Ortega's comments.  Ortega's bark is 
usually followed at some point by some form of a bite.  But 
just where Ortega's rhetoric meets his actions is remains to 
be seen.
