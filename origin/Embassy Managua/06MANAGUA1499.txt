SUBJECT: RESETTLEMENT OF CUBAN AND HAITIAN MIGRANTS (2)

     ¶B. STATE 78762 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Poloffs met with Ambassador Domingo Salinas, Director 
and Western Hemisphere Affairs at the Nicaraguan Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA) and U.S. Desk Officer Agnes Alvarado to 
discuss Nicaragua's willingness to assist in the resettlement 
of Cuban and Haitian migrants at Guantanamo.  After extensive 
discussions at the "highest levels," the GON decided that it 
can not accept migrants at this time, Salinas stated.  He 
confided that President Enrique Bolanos and Foreign Minister 
Norman Caldera are concerned that a hostile press may attack 
Bolanos for accepting migrants when the country is suffering 
economically.  Salinas also worried that the Sandinista Front 
(FSLN) may deport the Cuban migrants back to Cuba if Daniel 
Ortega wins the November 5 national elections. 
 
¶2. (C) Salinas was evidently disappointed with the GON 
decision, as he has worked hard in the past to assist Cuban 
migrants (ref A).  He commented that the GON may revisit its 
decision after the elections, depending on the outcome.
