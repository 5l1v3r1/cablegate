REF: STATE 48524 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
(S) On April 4, Ambassador approached Foreign Minister Norman 
Caldera regarding the possible resettlement of part, or all 
of, the 16 Uighur men of Chinese nationality that the USG has 
in detention at Guantanamo.  Caldera promised to consider the 
proposal and will consult with the proper Nicaraguan 
authorities.  He suggested that perhaps the Uighurs could 
find work in Managua's Free Trade Zone, where a number of 
Taiwanese companies operate.
