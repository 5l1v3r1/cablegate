1 (C) SUMMARY.  The simmering fight for influence within the 
Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) party between its 
largest unions - the Frente Nacional de Trabajadores (FNT) 
and the Central Sandinista de Trabajadores (CST) - has 
spilled onto the front page.  The largest FSLN union, the 
FNT, has taken a confrontational stance against business, 
while the two smaller unions appear more interested in 
finding arrangements with employers to preserve jobs.  The 
FNT, however, seems to enjoy the support of Daniel Ortega and 
his wife, for whom it is an element of their strategy to 
control the party and the country.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------- 
OPEN BATTLE BETWEEN FNT & CST 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) The behind the scenes power struggle between the FNT 
and CST (see reftel A) has recently made headlines.  On July 
26, the CST Workers Congress publicly denounced campaign led 
by FNT leader Gustavo Porras and Managua mayor's office 
secretary Fidel Moreno against CST union members, to entice 
them to abandon the CST and join the Union Nacional de 
Empleados (UNE) a FNT-affiliated public employee union. 
(COMMENT: Both Fidel Moreno and Gustavo Porras are closely 
allied with Rosario Murrillo, Daniel Ortega's wife and 
political partner. END COMMENT) 
 
-------------------------- 
PRO-BUSINESS OR PRO-LABOR? 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) As reported previously (see reftel B), two large 
labor unions (Congreso Permanente de Trabajadores (CPT) and 
Confederacion Sandinista de Trabajadores Jose Benito Escobar 
(CST-JBE) affiliated unions in the Free Trade Zones (FTZs)) 
signed a two-year minimum wage agreement with the goal of 
preserving employment in lieu of demanding higher wages.  The 
agreement is generally believed to be more "pro-business" 
than "pro-labor" by many prominent labor leaders.  Similarly, 
on May 30, three large labor confederations - Central 
Sandinista de Trabajadores (CST), Confederacion Unidad 
Sindical (CUS), Confederacion Unidad Sindical Autonomo (CUSA) 
- publically backed Carlos Pellas, president of the Pellas 
Group, Nicaragua's largest sugar and rum producer, against a 
campaign led by the International Union of Food Workers (IUF) 
to boycott Nicaragua's famed Flor de Cana rum.  IUF officials 
accused the Pellas Group of poisoning former workers at the 
Pellas sugar plantations, who have allegedly died from 
chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) in recent years.  CST, CUS 
and CUSA also signed an accord with the Pellas Group to 
guarantee employment for more than 7,000 workers.  FNT 
President Porras strongly condemned the three unions, in 
particular the CST, for supporting the Pellas Group instead 
of helping fellow workers and their families advance claims 
against the sugar company. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
DESPITE RHETORIC FSLN RELUCANT TO CALL WORKERS, CONGRESS 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) When the FSLN returned to power, many labor leaders thought that the GON would form a new national congress of labor to champion workers' rights and match FSLN campaign rhetoric. Instead, the GON has been reluctant to call for a Workers, Congress. Our labor contacts believe that the FSLN is afraid that by calling a national Workers, Congress they would lose control over the weak labor movement (see reftel A). In July, CST President Gonzales proposed holding a national labor forum on production, employment and social justice. Gonzales indicated that he was willing to negotiate any theme, including revising the minimum wage review to once a year (see reftel B), something the FNT, Porras and Murrillo vehemently oppose.
 
----------------- 
DADDY INTERVENES? 
----------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The rancorous verbal battle primarily between 
Gonzales and Porras finally convinced President Ortega to 
meet with Gonzales in August.  During the meeting, Ortega 
promised Gonzales that he would use his "good offices" to 
improve the treatment of the CST workers.  On August 14, El 
Nuevo Diario (national newspaper, 35,000 daily readership, 
center-left) reported that there are positive signals that 
Fidel Moreno would also meet with Gonzales to end the 
conflict.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6. (C) The political infighting between the FSLN-affiliated 
unions has only served to compound the plight of Nicaraguan's 
organized workers.  In a country where union affiliation has 
increasingly become a political tool rather than a vehicle 
for defending the rights of all workers, the FSLN is clearly 
trying to eliminate competing worker allegiance, so that only 
FSLN, and in particular, FNT-affiliated unions, have any 
"real" power or voice in the social justice dialogue.  Within 
the FSLN-affiliated unions, it appears that the FNT, and its 
leader Gustavo Porras, which consistently provide 
street-level "muscle" to support the party's intimidation 
tactics against opposition political parties and civil 
society, is likely to be the favorite of Ortega and Murrillo, 
despite some efforts at reconciliation with the other unions.
