SUBJECT: NASA HYTHIRM PROJECT: Nicaragua National Assembly Approves Overflight Permission for first six month of 2010

REF: A) 2010 JAN 14 - GROSS TO NYCE EMAIL; B) 2010 STATE 3837 C) 2009 MANAGUA 868; D) 2009 STATE 77073

¶1. (U) On December 3, the publication "La Gaceta" (Nicaragua's "Federal Register" equivalent) contained the text of a decree in which the Nicaraguan National Assembly approved the USG request to allow US Navy P-3 aircraft to overfly Nicaragua in support of certain NASA project missions. This formal USG request for permission for these flights, which would support NASA's Hypersonic Thermodynamic Infared Measurements (HYTHIRM) project, came after the Government of Nicaragua's (GON) denied an earlier request (REF C). The National Assembly approval was granted for missions only during the first six months of 2010. We anticipate that a second request covering the final six months of 2010 will be approved by the Assembly during a later session. We will monitor and report via separate telegram (SEPTEL).

¶2. (U) This vote complies with Nicaragua's constitutional requirement that all foreign military craft and personnel entering Nicaragua have prior approval from the National Assembly before entering Nicaraguan territory or airspace; however, it does not constitute diplomatic flight clearance for any specific mission. NASA/US Navy still must provide the Embassy with dates and flight information for each specific mission so that a diplomatic aircraft clearance can be requested from the GON, in accordance with established procedures and timelines.

Requesting Diplomatic Aircraft Clearance

¶3. (U) To request Diplomatic Aircraft Clearance for a specific NASA HYTHIRM mission, the operators of the P-3 must submit the following information to Embassy Managua's Defense AttachC) Office either via email (to the addresses indicated below) or, if available, through the online Aircraft and Personnel Automated Clearance System (APACS):
