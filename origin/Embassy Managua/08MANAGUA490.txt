¶1. (U) On April 2 the Nicaraguan Minister of Energy, Emilio 
Rappaccioli, wrote a letter to the Ambassador to inform us of 
Nicaragua's WIREC pledges for years 2008 to 2011.  The pledges 
include expanding the percentage of electricity generated from 
renewable sources from a 2008 base of 27% to 38% by 2011, while 
promoting the regulatory and legislative framework to ensure this 
result.  An informal translation of Rappaccioli's letter follows in 
paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. (U) In our response to Rappaccioli, we will inform him of the 
upcoming regional renewable energy seminars organized under the 
auspices of the OAS General Assembly's June 2007 Declaration of 
Panama. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Begin text of informal translation: 
 
Dear Ambassador, 
I make reference to your letter of March 25 in regard to the WIREC 
Conference, which served as a global platform for government and 
industry leaders to analyze and share information about the benefits 
of renewable energy, and in which local authorities, companies and 
civil society from more than 40 countries made significant pledges 
to take specific action to accelerate the use of said energy. 
 
In consideration of this, we will proceed to incorporate into the 
WIREC database our national pledges, based upon our 2008-2011 
national energy sector strategy. 
 
Likewise, I am informing you of our pledges, which the Ministry of 
Energy and Mining lists in the following attachment. 
 
My consideration and appreciation. 
 
Regards, 
Emilio Rappaccioli B 
Minister

generation, electric energy generation from renewable energy sources 
is to increase from a current 27% to 38% by the year 2011.  These 
renewable energies include:  geothermal, hydroelectric, biomass and 
wind. 
 
Promoting the regulatory framework and necessary legislation to
