SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: AMCIT PROPERTY CLAIMS MONTHLY UPDATE: APRIL 2009
 
SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. In April 2009, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) reported the 
resolution of seven Embassy registered property claims, of which six 
had been dismissed under Decree 38 (1979).  One of the claims was 
resolved through a land swap.  There remain 599 unresolved 
registered property claims belonging to 287 U.S. citizens in the 
Embassy's database.  To date, the overwhelming majority of 
resolutions have involved compensation via government-issued 
indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs). 
As of April 30, 2009, the GON had issued BPIs with a face value of 
$339,240,534.17 to Embassy-registered claimants.  Since taking 
office in January 2007, the Ortega administration has resolved 74 
claims, twenty-seven of which during the 2008-2009 waiver year. 
 
EMBASSY REGISTERED CLAIMS RESOLVED IN APRIL 
------------------------------------------- 

¶2. On April 16, 2009, the Attorney General's Office provided the Embassy a copy of the final settlement document or "finiquito" signed by U.S. citizen Norman Bonen-Castellon on April 2, 2009. The Castellon Estate received BPIs worth 3,542,300 cordobas, approximately $175,490. The claims had been dismissed under Decree 38 (1979), which authorized the confiscation of property belonging to the "allies" of the Somoza family. We have updated our database to reflect this settlement.

¶3. On May 5, 2009, Attorney General's Office provided the Embassy a copy of the settlement document signed by U.S. citizen Inesyvonne Conrado on June 23, 2008. Mrs. Conrado received government-owned property as compensation. We have updated our database to reflect this settlement.
