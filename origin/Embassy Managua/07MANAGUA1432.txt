SUBJECT: NICARAGUA GEOGRAPHICAL ASSISTANCE DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
 
¶1. (U) Summary: At the Ambassador's request, post has 
developed an online application that graphically displays 
all USG assistance projects directed at specific localities 
from 2000-2003 to the present.  The Geographical Assistance 
Distribution (GAD) Project also shows the geo-political 
breakdown of Nicaragua's departmental representatives and 
local governments.  The GAD Project is available on the 
Department of State OpenNet network under Embassy Managua's 
Intranet web page and may be accessed by clicking on "Other 
Links," then "GAD Project."  The direct OpenNet address is: 
webmanagua.managua.state.gov/DisplayContent.a sp?PAG_ID=37. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) The Nicaraguan GAD Project contains over 4,000 data 
points on about 200 maps displayed on the national, 
departmental, and municipal level.  The municipal maps 
illustrate projects from a full range of USG agencies, 
including: State, Agriculture, Defense, USAID, OPIC, Peace 
Corps, and MCC.  All of the maps are Adobe Acrobat files 
that can be downloaded or printed. 
 
National Level 
- - - - - - - - 
 
¶3. (U)  The national-level maps display results from the 
November 2006 national elections.  One map shows the 70 
departmental deputies who were elected by party, and 
another file displays the 20 national deputies chosen 
proportionately from party lists.  A third map reveals the 
relative geographic strengths of the different parties by 
showing the presidential vote totals by department (first 
and second place parties). 
 
Departmental Level 
- - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶4. (U) Departmental maps may be accessed from the GAD home 
page by clicking on the name of the department.  These maps 
display the departmental population and the political 
affiliation of the municipal mayors, as well as offering a 
bird's-eye view (via icons) of the different agencies with 
projects in that department.  Each departmental map also 
contains a corresponding link (by clicking on the 
department's name) to the Nicaraguan Municipal Association 
(AMUNIC) web site.  The AMUNIC web site offers political, 
historical, geographic, demographic, and infrastructure 
information on each municipality.  (Note: The AMUNIC 
population figures are based on outdated estimates.  The 
GAD maps contain information from the last official 
census.  End Note.) 
 
¶5. (SBU) On the departmental and municipal maps, certain 
municipalities are marked with a check icon.  Though not 
explained in the GAD, the check indicates that more 
information on the municipality is available in a 
classified database maintained by the Political Section. 
Post is planning a mirror site on the SIPRnet that will 
include direct links to the database. 
 
Municipal Level 
- - - - - - - - 
 
¶6. (U) The municipal maps, reached by clicking on the 
municipality's name on the departmental map, display the 
mayor and councilors coded by party affiliation, the 
population, and short descriptions of USG projects 
undertaken in that locale.  Where the information is 
available, we have indicated the specific neighborhood or 
village where the projects are located. 
 
Planned Upgrades 
- - - - - - - - - 
 
¶7. (U) The following are planned upgrades to increase the 
utility of the GAD Project: 
 
-- The project information on the current municipal maps is 
very brief due to space constraints.  We plan to develop a 
database on all of the projects that will contain much more 
detailed information (e.g., funding, time period, NGO 
partners, etc.) and link to the maps.  
 
-- Post agencies have formed a committee to review 
unsolicited project proposals from mayors, NGOs, and other 
sources.  We plan to include links on the municipal maps to 
these proposals to more easily match ongoing activities 
with solicited requests. 
 
-- The Adobe Acrobat platform that we are using is 
limited.  We intend to identify and upgrade to a suitable 
geographical information systems (GIS) platform in the 
future that will allow a variety of users to input data and 
access a much wider range of information.
