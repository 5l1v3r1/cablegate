SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. In February 2009, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) reported the 
resolution of one Embassy registered property claim.  There remain 
615 unresolved registered property claims belonging to 292 U.S. 
citizens in the Embassy's database.  To date, the overwhelming 
majority of resolutions have involved compensation via 
government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de 
indemnizacion" or BPIs).  As of February 28, 2009, the GON had 
issued BPIs with a face value of $334,903,642.78 to 
Embassy-registered claimants.    Since taking office in January 
2007, the Ortega administration has resolved 58 claims, eleven of 
which during the 2008-2009 waiver year.

¶2. On February 2, 2008, Attorney General Hernan Estrada provided the 
Embassy a copy of the final settlement document or "finiquito" 
signed on January 12, 2009, by U.S. citizen Yelba Barker.  Mrs. 
Barker received BPIs worth 14,908,600 cordobas, approximately 
$747,628.  We have updated our database to reflect this settlement.
