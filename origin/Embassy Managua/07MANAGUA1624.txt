REF: SECSTATE 60296 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Embassy delivered reftel points in May to Director 
General for Trade Sonia Somarriba, who promised to respond 
later as to whether Nicaragua would seek compensation. 
Since, the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Development 
(MIFIC) has undergone high-level changes, including the 
minister and both vice ministers (septel).  Orlando Solorzano 
was sworn in as minister on June 22.  On the margins of a 
June 27 meeting at MIFIC, Somarriba informed Econoff that the 
preliminary conclusion on the issue was that Nicaragua should 
negotiate some form of compensation with the United States. 
She could not elaborate, however, as there had been no 
closure on the subject.  Econoff reiterated reftel arguments, 
which Somarriba took on board.  Comment: We are not surprised 
at the proclivity to seek compensation, and will inform 
Washington as soon as we learn of MIFIC's final decision.
