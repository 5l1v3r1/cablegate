¶1. (SBU) In response to reftel request, Post continues to promote 
Financing for Development (FfD) and President Bush's New Development 
Compact based on partnership with countries that govern justly, 
invest in their peoples, and encourage economic freedom.  The 
partnership with the new Sandinista government has worked well in 
some sectors at the technical level, particularly in health and 
education, where the government has welcomed and supports USG and 
other donors' assistance programs.  However, donors agree that the 
central government has been averse to partnering in the area of 
governance, and that the "global partnership" with the government is 
weak. 
 
¶2. (SBU) One of Nicaragua's challenges is the lack of a national 
development plan.  The plan developed by the former government is 
being revised and is scheduled to be released in June or July, 2008. 
 While donors continue to meet among themselves to harmonize 
programs, the dialogue and coordination with the government has been 
limited.  Leadership on all foreign assistance issues rests with the 
Foreign Ministry, particularly with Vice Minister Valdrack 
Jaentschke. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The USG continues to work with the government, but has 
shifted its development assistance emphasis to working with the 
private sector and civil society, including faith-based 
organizations, and forming partnerships at the local municipal 
level.  Our programs continue to show positive results through 
partnerships with the private sector and with the growing civil 
society movement.  Financing for Development is widely accepted by 
the Municipal governments, which are closer to their constituents 
and must address the needs of their communities.
