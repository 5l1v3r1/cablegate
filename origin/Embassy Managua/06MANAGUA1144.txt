Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
(S/NF) Ambassador spoke with Nicaraguan Foreign Minister 
Norman Caldera on May 26 to convey points in reftel.  Caldera 
explained that any pro-G77 votes from Nicaragua regarding UN 
reform were the result of a "miscommunication" with the 
Nicaraguan mission to the UN.  He stated that the Nicaraguan 
Ambassador in New York "is now clear" on the GON position. 
Caldera promised to contact Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs 
Javier Williams Slate, who is en route to Malaysia, to ensure 
that the GON opposes any future pro-G77 votes and works to 
establish a consensus on the UN reform package.
