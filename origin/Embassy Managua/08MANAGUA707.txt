 SUMMARY

¶1.  (SBU)  Embassy Managua held the first in a series of 
several anti-trafficking in persons (TIP) workshops led by 
the U.S Department of Justice's Office of Overseas 
Prosecutorial Development, Assistance, and Training 
(DOJ/OPDAT), May 6-8. More than 40 participants representing 
the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP), Office of the National 
Prosecutor, government institutions, think tanks, and civil 
society attended the three-day workshop in what amounted to a 
reactivation of the Nicaraguan inter-agency National 
Coalition against Anti-Trafficking in Persons (NCATIP), 
dormant for nearly a year.  Under the direction of the OPDAT 
team, the invited group collaborated to develop the first 
draft of a manual for best practices to combat human 
trafficking incorporating prevention, protection, and 
prosecution of the crime.  The session helped to clarify 
confusion over current legislation on trafficking, slavery, 
children's rights, forced child labor, and sex crimes. It 
also demonstrated the urgency of ensuring that the new Penal 
Code, which has stricter penalties for trafficking crimes, be 
brought fully into force.  The participants also agreed to 
hold interim meetings until we host the next DOJ/OPDAT 
session, and were enthusiastic about the prospect of 
continuing this joint effort. END SUMMARY 
 
SLOW START, BUT MOVING IN RIGHT DIRECTION

¶2.  (SBU)  The aim of the Post's first OPDAT anti-trafficking 
training exercise, held May 6-8, was to facilitate networking 
between law enforcement, prosecutors, government of Nicaragua 
(GON) ministries, civil society, and other stake-holders; and 
to develop a best practices manual to address the problem of 
human trafficking in Nicaragua.  A DOJ/OPDAT team, under the 
direction of the RLA from Embassy Bogota, designed and led 
the workshop.  Participants represented many of the 
organizations and government institutions that constitute the 
National Coalition against Trafficking in Persons (NCATIP). 
The team encouraged the various stakeholders to move beyond 
the usual complaints about the lack of resources, the main 
excuse to explain why the TIP problem does not receive 
greater attention in Nicaragua. It was evident throughout the 
course of the program that most members of the Coalition 
operate in a vacuum and rarely come together to discuss plans 
or strategy.  Despite initial resistance at the opening of 
the training, by the time the workshop was over, there was a 
greater willingness among the participants to think "outside 
the box" and collaborate on workable solutions.  The workshop 
also fostered cooperation, coordination, and 
information-sharing. 
 
A FULL HOUSE, STRONG ATTENDANCE

¶3.  (SBU) The attendance exceeded our expectations, 
especially given the national transportation strike that was 
well underway at the time we opened the program.  We 
purposely invited key members of National Coalition against 
Trafficking in Persons who have been, or should be, most 
active on the trafficking issue.  Before holding the 
workshop, we had learned from several civil society contacts 
that the GON had not taken an active role in using the 
Coalition to engage civil society and had not convened a 
meeting since August 2007.  We brough
