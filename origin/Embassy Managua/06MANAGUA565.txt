Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Ambassador and team met with the OAS election 
mission on March 9 to assess the March 5 Atlantic Coast 
regional election and to determine the steps necessary to 
ensure clean, fair, credible, and inclusive national 
elections in November.  OAS Mission leader Gustavo Fernandez 
believes that in general terms, the regional election was 
conducted successfully, but notes a number of issues must be 
resolved before November, when the political stakes will be 
much higher and the possibility of fraud more likely.  He 
shared that the OAS will issue its report on the March 5 
election within two weeks. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Fernandez explained that the OAS is still working 
on its proposal to submit to the USG and other governments 
for funding.  OAS contracted technical team leader Patricio 
Gajardo estimated that the OAS could require as much as $6 
million for a "Cadillac" election mission.  (Note: We think a 
figure of $2.5 million to $3.5 million for the OAS portion of 
the effort is more realistic.)  Fernandez suggested that a 
coordinated plan integrating all donors - including CEPPS 
partner IFES - will lead to a more effective result, 
recommending that all partners concur on a strategy before 
presenting it to the Nicaraguan's Supreme Electoral 
Commission (CSE). Fernandez, who with most of his team 
returned to Washington over the March 11-12 weekend, will 
advise Secretary General Insulza to recommend the CSE form an 
advisory council of three non-partisan Nicaraguan notables to 
provide guidance and "moral" support to the Commission.  The 
OAS hopes to use the months of April and May for planning, 
kicking off in June thei 
r technical assistance efforts with the CSE and others. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Fernandez noted the following priority areas the OAS 
and other partners must address and resolve, with a plan of 
action in place ideally no later than June: 
 
--Hold at least a month of voter registry (padron) 
verification to scrub it of deceased members, and other 
anomalies. 
 
--Ensure all eligible Nicaraguans have national IDs (cedulas) 
or supplementary documents (documentos supletorios) so they 
can vote. 
 
--Make sure observers will have complete access to the 
process. 
 
--Ensure there are no disqualifications (inhibiciones) of 
candidates. 
 
--Make sure there will be adequate training of electoral 
officials, party monitors (fiscales), and international and 
domestic observers so that procedures are followed in a 
transparent, consistent manner. 
 
--Maintain OAS access to the CSE to monitor and provide 
technical assistance to the electoral body. 
 
¶4.  (C) Fernandez foresaw two possible interests motivating 
Nicaraguans when they go to the polls on November 5: they 
will either vote for, or against, Daniel Ortega and the 
Sandinistas, or they will vote for, or against, the 
Ortega-Aleman pact.  He believes that if most voters seek to 
avoid an Ortega win at all costs (the fear factor) the 
Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC) candidate will likely win. 
 On the other hand, if most voters vote against the 
Ortega-Aleman pact (reform factor), Herty Lewites or Eduardo 
Montealegre could win the presidency.

¶5.  (C) We expressed our concern to the OAS team that at 
least two security features to help prevent a person from 
voting more than once were inadequate in the Atlantic Coast 
election.  Voters in the high-stakes November election may be 
tempted to violate these features unless these flaws are 
resolved.  Specifically, the ink quality varied from site to 
site, as did the application of the ink on voters' thumbs 
 
(Note: Antonio Benavides, the CSE's Esteli departamental 
representative, admitted to poloff that there had been some 
problems with the ink (septel), adding that the CSE had 
obtained the ink this time from Venezuela).  Ink detection 
lamps (the ink was often not visible to the naked eye) were 
not used in most polling stations either because they were 
broken or the electoral officials were not trained to employ 
them.  Similarly, the hole punches to mark the cedulas of 
voters did not work properly and were discarded in a number 
of polling sites.
