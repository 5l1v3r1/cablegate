¶1. (SBU) In response to ref A, poloff met with Myriam 
Vasquez, the Nicaraguan Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Vice 
Director for Sovereignty, Territory and International Legal 
Issues.  (Note: Vasquez is the Ministry's terrorism guru. 
The Ministry recently decided that she will head Nicaragua's 
CICTE delegation, instead of Vice Foreign Minister Javier 
Williams Slate, as reported in ref B.  End Note.)  Vasquez 
stated that Nicaragua supports the Declaration of San Carlos 
in general, though would like to change the language in 
paragraph 6 of the preamble, which reads (unofficial 
translation from Spanish): 
 
- "Reaffirming that the threat of terrorism is aggravated by 
linkages that exist between terrorism, illegal arms 
trafficking, money laundering, and other forms of 
transnational organized crime..." 
 
Nicaragua would like to alter the language to read as follows 
(closer to the Venezuelan proposal): 
 
- "Reaffirming that the threat of terrorism is aggravated by 
linkages that ((CAN exist)) between terrorism, illegal arms 
trafficking, money laundering, and other forms of 
transnational organized crime..." 
 
¶2. (U) Vasquez also noted to poloff Nicaragua's proposed 
language for paragraph c under General Principles (c.bis.ii): 
 
- "The Member States have, in the spirit of mutual effort and 
collaboration, the responsibility of working together to 
prevent, fight and eliminate terrorism in an effective and 
integral manner."  (Nicaragua's alternative proposal) 
 
¶3. (SBU) In addition, Vasquez reported that the MFA had 
received new proposed language from Brazil on March 17 
regarding the preamble, which she had not yet had time to 
analyze.
