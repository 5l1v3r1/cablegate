REF: 08 SECSTATE 133426 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Robert J. Callahan for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
 
¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, Econoff conducted a pre-license check on 
December 30, 2008, at the El Cazador gun store located on 
Avenida Iglesia El Calvario, Managua, Nicaragua.  Econoff met 
with Carlos Melendez, general manager and one of the 
co-owners in the business.  Melendez has been a co-owner 
since December 2007 with a 15% share in the company. 
 
¶2. (SBU) El Cazador has been in business since 1994 and 
offers a selection of handguns, longarms, ammunition, and 
shooting/hunting accessories.  According to Melendez, 87% of 
the sales are to private citizens and the company also sells 
to security firms.  The store sells weapons and accessories 
purchased from U.S. companies such as Remington Arms, Luo 
Police, Valor Corporation, Phoenix, and Smith and Wesson. 
The company also sells weapons and accessories purchased from 
Trust Halcon (Spain), Armscore (Philippines), Zeta (Czech 
Republic), Akkar (Turkey), and used arms from El Salvador. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In 2008, El Cazador sold a limited number of weapons 
and ammunition to the Government of Nicaragua (GON), 
specifically to its security guard staff, for the following 
institutions: the National Police; ENACAL, the national water 
utility responsible for distribution, supply, and sanitation; 
Petronic, the parastatal company responsible for the 
development, distribution, and sale of Nicaragua's 
hydrocarbon resources; and CARUNA, a "private company" that 
provides microcredit to rural communities at low interest 
rates.  CARUNA is closely affiliated with the Sandinista 
party and is the primary conduit of funding from the 
Government of Venezuela through the Bolivarian Alternative of 
the Americas Initiative (ALBA).  El Cazador would like to do 
business with the Nicaraguan Army. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Melendez showed Econoff copies of all invoices 
related to purchases from U.S. and foreign companies 
beginning in 2006 until 2008.  He provided Econoff a copy of 
a purchase order to receive 80 revolvers from Smith and 
Wesson which were shipped from the U.S. on December 15, 2008. 
 Melendez also provided a copy of the purchase order for 
Smith and Wesson products related to this pre-license check. 
El Cazador maintains electronic files of all purchases and 
submits a list every month to the police with the names of 
the customers and a description of their purchases.  Melendez 
was familiar with the Arms Export Control Act and 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The store has a controlled access entry with 
rotating security guards stationed in the front entrance 24 
hours a day, 7 days per week.  The security guard inspects 
all customers before they enter the store.  Once the security 
finishes the inspection, he gives a signal to the customer 
service representative to electronically open the door.  El 
Cazador has two gun storage areas with alarms and video 
surveillance.  The doors to the storage facilities have dead 
bolt locks as reinforcement. 
 
¶6. (SBU) A request for bio data on all of the owners of El 
Cazador resulted in the following information: Ricardo Jose 
Melendez Quintanilla (DOB 10-JUN-52); Mauricio Valenzuela 
Sotomayor (DOB 20-AUG-1955); Ernesto Gallo Schaffer (DOB 
03-JUN-1987); Carlos Augusto Melendez Rodriguez 
(04-DEC-1978); Glenda Auxiliadora Ramirez Noguera 
(09-SEP-1957); and Carlos Zamora Herrera (25-JUL-1955).  All 
of the owners are Nicaraguan nationals.  Econoff asked about 
Zamora's role in El Cazador.  Melendez said that Zamora, a 
founding member of El Cazador along with Gallo, was 
previously general manager but now is only a co-owner with an 
18% share in the company. 
 
¶7. (C) Local name checks conducted by Post's Regional 
Security Office, Defense Attache Office, Regional Affairs 
Office, and the Drug Enforcement Agency revealed only that 
Ramirez was a Minister of Family Affairs from January 2007 
until February 2007.  She is considered a Sandinista 
hardliner but she was fired in February 2007 because she did 
not receive permission from First Lady Rosario Murillo to 
give an interview to a local newspaper.  Local name checks 
did not provide derogatory information on Zamora.  Post could 
not verify ties between Zamora and Roberto Calderon Meza, the 
former Sandinista General. 
 
 
¶8. (SBU) Based on the information available, Post has no 
evidence of illicit arms deals involving El Cazador. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Comment: We note that this company, one of its owners, and some of its clients are closely associated with the Sandinista regime. The U.S. and other donors have recently cut or suspended aid in response to electoral fraud committed in the November 9 municipal elections and increasing anti-democratic measures taken by the governments. End Comment.
