SUBJECT: Kill the Messenger: A Case Study in FSLN Political Tactics 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: RobertJCallahan, Ambassador, State, Embassy Managua; REASON: 1.4(B), (D)
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: Since President Daniel Ortega entered office in 
2007, his Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) party has 
attacked its political opponents as well as those within its party 
structure it views as opposition.  The latest examples of this are 
a Managua city councilmember and the  water regulatory agency's 
consumer division chief.  The councilmember was politically 
attacked for his constant criticism of and demand for transparency 
from the FSLN-controlled local government.  The division chief was 
fired from her position for not following orders from Ortega's 
office to support the political attack on the city councilmember. 
These are not the first in the FSLN's attacks, and are not likely 
to be the last.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
FSLN Attacks Opposition 
 
 
 
¶2.  (C) Since the new Managua city council entered office in 
January 2009, Luciano Garcia has been the only critical voice in 
the city council.  He is from the Conservative Party, but was 
elected from the Vamos con Eduardo-Constitutional Liberal Party 
(VcE-PLC) ticket.  Since the beginning of the year he has 
consistently voted in opposition to FSLN attempts to politicize the 
city's functions (e.g., giving the FSLN partisan Citizen Power 
Councils authority in local governance).  Garcia has also requested 
from the mayor and secretariat (both FSLN members) clarification on 
the use of city funds (e.g., why the city paid for the fueling of 
800 motorcycles on the eve of the FSLN's annual July 19 anniversary 
of the revolution).  Garcia's outspokenness has annoyed the 
governing FSLN, particularly Managua Mayor Deisy Torres and City 
Council Secretary Fidel Moreno.  Both of these FSLN militants are 
reportedly close to First Lady Rosario Murillo.  As a result, the 
FSLN appears to have set-up a political attack to discredit Garcia. 
 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On November 24 at 5:30 pm, the Nicaraguan water company 
(ENACAL) inspected the home of Garcia and reported that the city 
council member had an illegal water connection for over a year. 
ENACAL charged that through the illegal connection Garcia was able 
to lower his water bill from 3,000 cordobas a month in 2008 to 300 
cordobas a month in 2009.  This inspection was conducted in the 
presence only of official media (Channel 4 television and Radio 
Ya).  These media organizations then reported on Garcia as a thief 
who robbed from the people of Managua.  As a result of the 
inspection, ENACAL charged Garcia a seven-month fine and 
reconnection fees.  Garcia then filed a complaint with the 
regulating agency for the water company (INAA), the established 
procedure for these cases.  INAA conducted its own site inspection 
accompanied by members of ENACAL.  Based on the INAA inspection, 
Lizeth de Trinidad, Consumer Division Chief, issued a decision 
finding in favor of Garcia and instructing ENACAL not to charge the 
fees nor fines.  The following day, de Trinidad was fired. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (C) Garcia told us that the ENACAL inspection and charges were 
false and politically motivated based on his criticisms of the 
FSLN-run City Hall.  Aside from the INAA decision, he presented to 
us other evidence of his innocence including his water bills for 
the past two years that discredited ENACAL's charges and reports 
from two human rights organizations which found no evidence of an 
illegal connection.  Despite INAA's decision, Garcia fears the 
government will continue the case and possibly file criminal 
charges against him.  He also told us that since the beginning of 
this case, other government entities have harassed him.  Aside from 
his work on the city council, Garcia owns clothing stores and an 
import business.  Both the Directorate General for Taxes (DGI) and 
Directorate General for Customs (DGA) have been financially and 
administratively harassing his businesses.  Garcia's fear of 
further reprisals has led him to remove himself as the legal 
representatives of his businesses and place most of his assets in 
the names of family members.  His ability to defend his public 
image, meanwhile, was hurt by the PLC's public statement siding 
with the FSLN against Garcia. 
 
FSLN Fires Within 
 
 
 
¶5.  (C) The other victim in this case was Lizeth de Trinidad, the 
Consumer Division Chief at INAA who was fired for her decision in 
favor of Garcia.  De Trinidad had worked for the agency since its 
creation 16 years ago.  She had worked her way up in the 
organization and was one of four division chiefs at the agency. 
Her position as division chief was a senior position within the 
agency, and she reported directly to the president of INAA.  She 
told us that her decision in Garcia's case was based on the merits 
of the matter and the INAA inspector's work.  (The inspector, she 
noted, had over 30 years experience.)  Due to the political 
implications of the case, de Trinidad consulted with the INAA 
president's executive assistant, Carlos Berrios, prior to issuing 
her decision; Berrios had concurred with de Trinidad's decision. 
(Note: The INAA president was out of the country at the time.) 
 
 
 
¶6.  (C) De Trinidad issued her decision on November 2 and that 
afternoon received a telephone call from Salvador Vanegas, an 
assistant to President Daniel Ortega, telling her to attend a 
meeting at the offices of ENACAL.  She told us that present at the 
meeting were Vanegas, Ruth Selma (Executive Director of ENACAL), 
and Berrios.  Vanegas told the group that they would hold a press 
conference after their meeting and that de Trinidad would retract 
her decision and state that Garcia had indeed stolen water from the 
city.  When de Trinidad refused, Vanegas told her to submit her 
resignation letter.  She again refused, stating she had done 
nothing wrong and that ENACAL could contest the decision through 
legal means.  On November 3, Vanegas went to INAA and had Berrios 
fire de Trinidad.  (Note: Because of her position, only the INAA 
president could fire de Trinidad.) 
 
 
 
¶7.  (C) De Trinidad admitted that the case against Garcia was 
groundless and politically motivated.  She also confirmed that she 
was wrongfully terminated from her position, but would not seek 
legal recourse to avoid any problems.  While she is not an active 
member of the FSLN, she told us that the only party she has ever 
belonged to or identified with is the FSLN, with whom she worked in 
the 1980s.  She said to us, "I know this government, I know these 
people, and I don't want to confront them.  I don't want any 
problems for my children, my husband or my mother." 
 
 
 
Comment 
 
 
 
¶8.  (C) Many Nicaraguans tell us that the FSLN threatens the 
opposition, but actually attacks those from within its ranks.  Such 
was the case of Garcia and de Trinidad, and there are many more 
like these.  The attacks against opposition figures is meant to 
discredit their public image, intimidate them into silence, and 
keep them busy with other matters so they don't have time to focus 
on the FSLN's waste and fraud in government.  Meanwhile, the FSLN 
attacks its own members or sympathizers, confident there will be no 
adverse political or legal consequences.  Unfortunately, to a large 
extent the FSLN has been successful with this approach.
