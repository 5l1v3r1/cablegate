SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On November 19, U.S. citizen claimant Juan Barreto signed 
a settlement document, or "finiquito," for the equivalent of $3.2 
million dollars to compensate him for 28 properties expropriated by 
the Nicaraguan Army.  With the inclusion of Mr. Barreto's case, the 
Government of Nicaragua has resolved 39 claims during the current 
waiver year.  The resolution of the Barreto case represents the 
largest number of claims resolved for one U.S. citizen at one time. 
The GON deserves credit for sticking to its commitment to resolve 
this high-profile property case. 
 
GON RESOLVES BARRETO CASE

¶2. (U) On November 19, U.S. citizen Juan Barreto, whose 28 
properties the Nicaraguan Army expropriated in 1980 (Ref A), signed 
a "finiquito" to accept compensation in the form of indemnification 
bonds (BPIs) with a face value of $3.2 million.  The GON provided 
the Property Office a copy of the finiquito on November 20.  Mr. 
Barreto will receive his BPIs in December.  His case represents 28 
property claims registered with the Embassy Property Office.

¶3. (U) With the inclusion of the Barreto case, the GON has resolved 
39 claims so far during this waiver year (septel).  During the 
2008-2009 waiver year, the GON resolved 48 claims.  In addition, 
the resolution of the Barreto case is the largest number of claims

There remain 23 U.S. citizen claims for properties under the 
control of the Army. 
 
COMMENT 
 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The GON deserves credit for sticking to its commitment to 
resolve this high-profile case.  When the GON began negotiations 
with Mr. Barreto in June 2008, the talks were contentious at times 
and each side accused the other of not negotiating in good faith. 
However, Attorney General Hernan Estrada told the Ambassador on 
September 30, 2008, that he would resolve the case (Ref B), and he 
has made good on his promise.
