SUBJECT: EU LIKELY TO SEND OBSERVATION MISSION FOR 
NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) The European Union Commission official heading the 
EU election observation exploratory mission to Nicaragua, 
Andrew Bruce, gave a presentation to the Elections Donor 
Group on the parameters of a possible EU electoral 
observation mission (EOM).  Although the mission will not 
conclude until next week, Bruce informed the EDG unofficially 
(please protect) that he will recommend that the Commission 
authorize the EOM.  EU Commissioner for External Relations 
Bonita Ferrero Waldner will make the final decision some time 
in July. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The proposed EOM would be headed by a Chief Observer 
(likely a senior member of the EU Parliament) supported by a 
Deputy and a staff of about 10 officials who, except for the 
Chief Observer, will arrive in country 6-8 weeks before the 
elections and stay until mid to late December.  The EOM would 
be independent, but the Commission and the member states 
represented locally would have an advisory role.  The EOM 
would also have 20-22 long-term observers who would be 
stationed throughout the country, and a number of short-term 
observers who would deploy on Election Day.  The total 
mission would number about 100 people. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The EOM would release a statement of preliminary 
findings one to two days after the election and a final 
detailed report with recommendations for future elections two 
to three months later.  (Comment: Bruce was adamant that the 
EU EOM coordinate observation efforts and public statements 
closely with other international EOMs and focus on results to 
EOM recommendations.  He regards Nicaragua as a good "test 
case" to push for reforms after the election season.  End 
Comment.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Later the same day, EC Ambassador Francesca Mosca, 
EC Central American and Mexico Officer for the External 
Relations Directorate-General and Elections Desk Officer for 
External Relations Andrew Bruce met with Ambassador, DCM, 
polcouns, and USAID democracy director.  The Ambassador noted 
to the EC representatives the importance of an EU observer 
mission to complement the OAS and other observer teams and 
missions.  Ambassador Mosca explained that every year, the EU 
observes in 10-12 priority countries that are holding 
elections, and Nicaragua is on this year's list.  Ambassador 
Mosca shared that once the EU observer mission is on the 
ground, its Chief Observer will make necessary observations 
on areas of concern, including problems with national/voter 
ID (cedula) issuance, to Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) 
authorities, and if necessary, to the media.  She also voiced 
concern over the lack of regulations concerning political 
party access to media time, warning that one party could buy 
up most of the air time and exclude its competitors. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Ambassador Mosca agreed with the Ambassador that 
coordination among international observers is crucial to 
prevent the release of confusing or contradictory 
assessments, as is international observer access to the CSE's 
vote computation and transmission centers.  She added that 
the EU observer mission will also impress upon the CSE the 
need to release its results to the public as they come in. 
Ambassador shared that we are supporting two quick counts, 
which will help to discourage any efforts to manipulate the 
election results.
