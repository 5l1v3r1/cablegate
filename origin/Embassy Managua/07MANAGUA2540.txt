REF: SECSTATE 159386 
 
On December 4 we delivered the refel talking points to 
Orlando Gomez, Director General for American Affairs; Mario 
Barquero Baltodano, Acting Director General for International 
Organization Affairs; and David McField, Director General for 
Asia Africa and Oceania; all of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs.  Gomez and Barquero inquired as to any developments 
or changes in the Middle East Peace process that had come out 
of the recent Annapolis Conference and noted that the USG's 
"unwillingness to communicate with Hamas, which is the 
democratically-elected government of Palestine," would seem 
to create a formidable obstacle to progress.  We explained 
that there were very well-known and public reasons for our 
decision to work directly with President Abbas.  We noted our 
good relationship with Abbas and that he had met several 
times with President Bush, including during the Annapolis 
Conference.
