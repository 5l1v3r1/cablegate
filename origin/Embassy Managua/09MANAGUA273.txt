Summary 
------- 

¶1. (SBU) Minister of Agriculture and Forestry (MAGFOR) Ariel Bucardo 
told the Ambassador during a March 4 meeting that he had lifted a 
ban on the importation U.S. beef and live cattle.  MAGFOR enacted 
the ban in 2003 when an animal infected with Bovine Spongiform 
Encephalopathy was discovered in the United States.  Bucardo made a 
pitch for additional government-to-government Food for Progress 
(FFP) funds to continue support for the establishment of a plant and 
animal safety system.  Given Nicaragua's interest in this topic, the 
Ambassador pressed Bucardo on MAGFOR's failure to send officials to 
more than 40 USDA training opportunities over the last two years. 
Bucardo blamed the absences on administrative ineptitude; Vice 
Minister Benjamin Dixon promised to coordinate more closely with the 
Embassy.  Bucardo concluded with a description of MAGFOR's 
agricultural development program "Hambre Zero," which relies on 
Citizen Power Councils to decide how to distribute benefits.  End 
Summary. 
 
Meeting Attendees 
----------------- 

¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Callahan met with Minister of Agriculture and Forestry (MAGFOR) Ariel Bucardo on March 4. Before Ortega named him Minister, Bucardo was President of the National Rural Fund (CARUNA), an FSLN-linked financial cooperative that in addition to microfinance operations now handles funds generated through Nicaragua's participation in the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA). Accompanying Bucardo in the meeting were Vice Minister Benjamin Dixon, who is responsible for sanitary and phytosanitary issues at MAGFOR, and Claudia Tijerino, MAGFOR Director for Foreign Assistance. APHIS officer, FAS local staff, and econoff accompanied the Ambassador.
 
Ban on U.S. Beef Lifted 
----------------------- 

¶3. (SBU) Bucardo told the Ambassador that Nicaragua had lifted a ban 
on the importation of live cattle, beef, and beef byproducts from 
the United States.  MAGFOR had enacted the ban in 2003 after the 
discovery of an animal infected with Bovine Spongiform 
Encephalopathy (BSE, or Mad Cow Disease) in the United States. 
Although U.S. authorities had implemented safeguards to minimize the 
risk of further BSE infection, and the World Organization for Animal 
Health (OIE) classified the United States as "controlled risk" for 
BSE, Nicaragua continued to prohibit imports of U.S. deboned beef 
from cattle older than 30 months, all bone-in-beef, and live cattle. 
 
 
USDA Cooperative Programs 
------------------------- 

¶4. (SBU) Bucardo made a pitch for more government-to-government Food for Progress (FFP) funds. He and Vice Minister Benjamin Dixon explained that FFP funding, due to run out in 2009, had been critical to MAGFOR's plant and animal safety programs. The Ambassador commented that for more than ten years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had provided funding for the establishment of a system for plant and animal safety, and that it would be appropriate at this stage for MAGFOR to use local funds to maintain the system. Bucardo argued that without FFP funds, MAGFOR would discontinue these programs, and Nicaragua's ability to export agricultural products to markets such as the United States would be threatened. In fact, Bucardo wanted additional FFP funding to develop a system for plant and animal traceability.
 
Failure to Participate in USDA Training 
--------------------------------------- 

¶5. (SBU) Following up on the topic of plant and animal safety, the Ambassador asked Bucardo why MAGFOR officials had missed more than 40 USDA training opportunities over the last two years. Bucardo responded that he had worked out issues related to presidential authorization for MAGFOR officials to travel outside Nicaragua. He conceded that MAGFOR still needed to improve internal processes to take advantage of these opportunities. Vice Minister Dixon promised to take a more "hands on" approach on this topic in coordination with new Director General for Plant and Animal Health Gregory Campbell.
 
"Hambre Zero" 
------------- 

¶6. (SBU) Bucardo concluded with a description of MAGFOR's agricultural development program, "Hambre Zero" or Zero Hunger. Bucardo claimed that the program -- which provides livestock, feed, seed, and fertilizer to rural poor -- had already benefitted 32,000 families and would benefit an additional 15,000 in 2009. In addition, he emphasized MAGFOR efforts to promote value chains for agricultural products through credit and technical assistance.
 
¶7. (SBU) Throughout 2007 and 2008, President Ortega touted ALBA funding for "Hambre Zero." FSLN Controlled Citizen Power Councils (CPCs) have played an important role in deciding who benefits. However, the 2009 budget -- still being debated in the National Assembly -- includes a $20 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to continue "Hambre Zero," and med{/QAQ&O{ for the distribution of benefits that would sideline the CPCs.
