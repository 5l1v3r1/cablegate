¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: On May 9, Codel Burton (Representatives 
Burton, Meeks, Akin, Bordallo, Marchant, and Watson) made a 
brief stopover in Nicaragua on their way back to the United 
States from Costa Rica.  During their time in Nicaragua, the 
Codel met with Embassy staff for a briefing on elections 
activities, with elections partners (CEPPS and NGOS) to 
discuss current efforts, and then gave a brief press 
conference.  The Codel's comments at the press conference 
were general, emphasizing the importance of free, fair and 
transparent elections in Nicaragua, but still garnered 
extensive coverage by all major media. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Ambassador briefed the Codel prior to their 
meeting with Post's election partners and provided an 
overview of the situation and each of the presidential 
candidates.  He emphasized that the USG is not endorsing 
specific candidates, rather the goal is to provide the 
"political space" for a democratic candidate to be elected in 
a fair election.  He explained  that the Sandinista 
(FSLN)-Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC) pact is detrimental 
to democracy in Nicaragua.  The Ambassador also talked about 
Chavez's open support for Ortega. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Burton asked if Sandinista dissident Herty Lewites 
will actually run for office; the Ambassador replied that he 
believes Lewites' intentions are genuine and that he truly 
wants to reform Sandinismo.  Meeks sought  a clarification on 
the candidates' platforms, to which the Ambassador replied 
that at this point there are no clear platforms, only 
personalities.  The Ambassador outlined two key U.S. concerns 
-- that Arnoldo Aleman still  controls  the PLC, and that 
election results could be manipulated to 
ensure victory by the PLC or FSLN.  Watson inquired  about 
the significance of the Atlantic Coast election results, to 
which the Ambassador replied that we should not read to much 
into the results -- using them to predict the outcome of the 
national elections is like using a state assembly race in 
Alaska to predict the outcome of the U.S. national election. 
 
CEPPS AND NGOS ENGAGED 
---------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Each of the CEPPS partners and NGOs outlined  their 
election programs.  The CEPPS partners have been focused on 
cedulas (national identification card needed to vote), the 
padron (voter rolls) and "get out the vote" activities. 
According to IFES, close to 200,000 national ID cards 
(cedulas) have not been distributed to  voters.  IFES is 
working with the CSE (Supreme Electoral Council) to ensure 
greater distribution of cedulas by funding fixed kiosks and 
mobile units in areas without access to CSE regional or 
municipal offices.  To counter young voter apathy, IRI is 
providing funds to JUDENIC, a local youth NGO, to implement a 
Nicaraguan Rock the Vote style campaign called "Tu Voz, Tu 
Voto."  IRI will also train over 39,000 "fiscales" (election 
monitors) from the ALN-PC, MRS and AC to monitor voting. 
Several of the representatives asked why they were not going 
to train observers for all the parties, to include the FSLN 
and PLC; IRI replied that the CSE is controlled by the FSLN 
and the PLC so they are being trained under the Council's 
program.  The representative from NDI mentioned that they are 
working with the parties. 
 
¶5.  (U) NDI's national padron audit, implemented by Etica y 
Transparencia (ET) and the Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), 
is well underway, with the roll-out and final report expected 
in late May.  Separately, ET and UCA have completed the first 
stage of a  study documenting the process to obtain cedulas. 
The results of the findings will be shared with business 
associations and other entities to encourage all employees to 
obtain cedulas.  Based on the results of the padron audit and 
cedula study, NDI will fund a public awareness campaign to 
pressure the CSE to clean-up the padron and improve its 
cedulation process.  ET also plans to fund a "quick count" 
for the election to tally preliminary results. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Additionally, Movimiento por Nicaragua (MpN) began 
a pilot project with Public Affairs Democracy Funds to create 
a Citizen Attention Center in Managua to help Nicaraguans, 
especially those with limited income, to acquire birth 
certificates required to apply for cedulas.  Once necessary 
paperwork is completed, with the assistance of MpN's legal 
and secretarial staff, MpN charters buses to transport 
Nicaraguans to the CSE to personally apply for cedulas.  With 
additional funding from NDI, MpN will expand the Managua 
Center and add three new centers throughout the country.  The 
expanded Centers will also provide voter education pamphlets 
and announcements to educate citizens on the need to 
participate in the electoral process.  This successful effort 
will be multiplied throughout the country with USAID funds. 
 
VENEZUELAN INFLUENCE 
-------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) During the CEPPS meeting, Congressman Burton asked 
about other country's support for specific presidential 
candidates.  The representatives from ET and MpN spoke about 
Hugo Chavez's support for Daniel Ortega's campaign, including 
a promise of oil and fertilizer.  ET added that Venezuelan 
support may total USD 50 million and will include mobilizing 
helicopters to help the Ortega campaign.  Under Nicaraguan 
electoral law, there is no problem in accepting donations 
from abroad for campaigns. 
 
SHORT, BUT GREAT MEDIA COVERAGE 
------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (U) After the meeting with CEPPS partners and NGOs, the 
Codel gave a brief press conference.  Members gave a short 
introduction, commented on the need for free, fair and 
transparent elections and encouraged the Nicaraguan people to 
vote.  They pointed out that this was a bipartisan Codel, but 
they are united in their belief in democracy, which is why 
they had stopped in Nicaragua.  Burton took several 
questions, ranging  from whether the United States would work 
with any elected government to whether there would be 
legislation on immigration soon.  Burton emphasized that the 
United States will work with any government that is elected 
through free, fair and democratic elections.  He also 
commented that he believes there will soon be a bipartisan, 
realistic policy on immigration.  All major media carried the 
story the next day.  There were extensive articles in the two 
major newspapers, and several of the television stations ran 
the entire press conference.
