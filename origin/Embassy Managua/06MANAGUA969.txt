SUBJECT: LEWITES WARNS DAS MADISON THAT AN ORTEGA 
GOVERNMENT WILL BE A DICTATORSHIP 
 
REF: MANAGUA 0855 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In Sandinista (FSLN)-dissident Herty 
Lewites' April 24 meeting with DAS Madison, USAID DAA Mike 
Magan, and Ambassador, Lewites warned that if FSLN leader 
Daniel Ortega wins the November elections, Ortega will impose 
a dictatorship on the Nicaraguan people and assume total 
control over Nicaragua's police and military.  To Lewites, 
his left-center coalition and Liberal dissident Eduardo 
Montealegre's right-center alliance offer the best hope for 
Nicaragua and reflect the aspirations of most Nicaraguans. 
Ortega and Aleman, however, enjoy the financial backing of 
Chavez and Nicaraguan capital, respectively.  Herty warned 
that Ortega will try to reach the presidency "through hook or 
by crook," and is a threat not only to Nicaragua, but also to 
the region at large.  Lewites believes he can resist the 
Ortega's behind-the-scenes political manipulations.  He 
revealed that he plans on choosing economist/lawyer Edmundo 
Jarquin as his running mate.  END SUMMARY. 
 
NICAS HELD HOSTAGE BY ORTEGA BECAUSE ALEMAN LETS HIM

¶2.  (C) In Sandinista (FSLN)-dissident Herty Lewites' April 
24 meeting with DAS Madison, USAID DAA Mike Magan, and 
Ambassador, Lewites blamed Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC) 
caudillo/convicted money launderer Arnoldo Aleman for 
enabling FSLN leader Daniel Ortega to hold Nicaragua hostage. 
 According to Lewites, Ortega has gained control of most 
Nicaragua institutions because his pact with Aleman has 
allowed him to do so, adding that at least this election 
year, Nicaraguans have two new choices, he and Eduardo 
Monteaelgre, both who offer to lead Nicaraguans in a positive 
direction. 
 
PLAYING THE LEGITIMACY CARD, PROTECTING THE VOTE 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶3.  (C) Lewites opined that Ortega is torn between his 
ambitions to don the presidential sash and the realization 
that the elections must look clean for him to rule 
legitimately.  The international community can best help by 
impressing upon Ortega and the Sandinista-controlled Supreme 
Electoral Commission (CSE) the necessity of clean, fair, and 
transparent elections, urged Lewites.  Ambassador, DAS, and 
DAA assured Lewites that this issue is the thrust of U.S. and 
other donors' efforts and we will indeed play the credibility 
card.  Lewites also sought USG support in defending 
Nicaraguans' right to vote, to ensure that all "ballots get 
in the box."  To Lewites, Nicaragua's laws are virtually 
worthless; the FSLN and PLC play with them to suit their 
interests.  For example, the FSLN-dominated Supreme Electoral 
Council (CSE) moved up the deadlines for alliance and 
candidate registrations from July to May to reduce his and 
Montealegre's chances to form broader alliances, complained 
Lewites. 
 
¶4.  (C) Voicing appreciation for IRI's efforts to help 
Nicaragua prepare for its national elections, Lewites 
recounted that IRI had called him last week and offered to 
help train his party's poll watchers (fiscales).  To Lewites, 
the real challenge, however, is convincing people to vote; a 
high turnout will increase his chances to win the presidency. 
 Lewites expressed concern that the OAS will deploy only 80 
observers on Election Day, not enough in his view.  In 
contrast to the situation in Nicaragua, Lewites noted that 
Mexican Presidential Candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador 
does not need an army in Mexico to protect his votes because 
the Mexican people respect the institutions.  Lewites opined 
that safeguarding the validity of Nicaragua's election will 
require the use of diplomatic pressure and possibly street 
protests. 
 
DANIEL IS THE BOGEYMAN, I'M DIFFERENT

¶5.  (C) Lewites asserted that Ortega is striving to 
consolidate his dictatorship.  He warned that if Ortega wins, 
he will assume total control the Nicaraguan Army and the 
Nicaraguan National Police and will destabilize the region. 
Lewites explained that he was born in a dictatorship and that 
he does not want to die in one.  The key challenge is 
convincing all eligible voters to go to the polls on November 
¶5. 
 
 
¶6.  (C) Lewites shared his plans to counter the attacks that 
he expects from Ortega's campaign, claiming that Ortega has 
threatened everyone that has become president since he left 
office in 1990.  Lewites related that he has warned Ortega 
that if he tries a similar tactic with him, he will throw 
Ortega in prison, which is why Ortega does not want to see 
Lewites in power.  Further, if Lewites wins, Ortega will not 
be able to "govern from below" as he has done in the past. 
While Lewites lambasted Ortega's obsession with returning to 
power, he asserted that it is again time for Nicaraguans to 
elect a Sandinista -- Lewites -- as only another Sandinista 
will be able to settle the Ortega problem. 
 
¶7.  (C) Lewites added that he is the only candidate with a 
record of concrete achievements (as mayor of Managua).  He 
acknowledged that Montealegre enjoys fiscal credibility but 
claimed he has little popular appeal.  Further, Lewites 
claimed he is the most "Nicaraguan" of the candidates and 
possesses the energy to resist being blackmailed by Ortega. 
Lewites also disclosed that he is well known by Jewish 
capitalists in Central America and they trust his word. 
 
NO TO A POSSIBLE JOINT LEWITES-MONTEALEGRE TICKET 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶8.  (C) Lewites confirmed that some people have suggested 
that he and Montealegre join forces on one ticket.  However, 
he dismissed this possibility because he believes such an 
alliance would only help Ortega-Aleman Pact supporters. 
However, he does not intend to attack Montealegre, cautioning 
that presidential candidates should be careful not to insult 
each other or voters will think they are all the same --"the 
poor do not care about the Pact if they do not have anything 
to eat," observed Lewites. 
 
FOCUS ON EDUCATION 
- - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Lewites underscored his commitment to making 
education a priority, lamenting that one million school-aged 
Nicaraguans do not attending school.  In his view, enrollment 
should have increased, but former President Aleman and others 
were more concerned with increasing their political and 
economic power than taking care of the Nicaraguan people. 
 
IDB EXPERT EDMUNDO JARQUIN IS HERTY'S RUNNING MATE 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶10.  (C) Lewites also shared that he will select Edmundo 
Jarquin as his running mate, a man who will not attract 
votes, but who will help reform Nicaraguan's economy, address 
its large domestic debt, and  deal effectively with the World 
Bank, IMF, and the IDB, as well as bilateral donors.  (Note: 
Post reported on this possibility in Managua 0855.  Dr. 
Edmundo Jarquin is a lawyer and economist, former university 
professor, Ambassador to Spain and Mexico during the 
Sandinista regime, and a National Assembly Deputy in the 
early 1990s.  Lewites explained that Jarquin has worked for 
the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) for 18 years and 
is currently working for Enrique Iglesias in Spain.)
