Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
(C) On April 4, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Norman Caldera 
informed the Ambassador that the GON had already approached 
Panama on supporting Guatemala in its race with Venezuela for 
a non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council (UNSC). 
The Panamanians replied that the GOP has already signed an 
agreement with the Venezuelans to support Venezuela in its 
bid for the position in exchange for certain favors to which 
Caldera is not privy.  Caldera commented that the Venezuelans 
would be a disaster on the UNSC and promised to make one more 
effort with the Panamanians.  He will advise us of the 
outcome.
