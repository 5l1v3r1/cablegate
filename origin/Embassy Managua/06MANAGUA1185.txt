SUBJECT: NICARAGUA SUPPORTIVE ON U.S. STATEMENT ON IRAN 
 
REF: STATE 87682 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
(C) Post received Reftel after the release of the U.S. 
statement on Iran.  On June 1, DCM demarched Nicaraguan 
Foreign Minister Norman Caldera on the subject and received 
Caldera's assurances that the Nicaraguan government (GON) 
will support the U.S. in public and private.  Caldera will 
assign Vice Minister Mauricio Gomez to draft a GON 
declaration.  Caldera also offered to talk to the Nicaraguan 
Ambassador to Mexico to speak to his Iranian counterpart -- 
who also covers Nicaragua from Mexico -- and to give him a 
copy of the declaration.  He will also share a copy of the 
GON declaration with us.   Caldera reiterated that his 
government will urge Iran to take advantage of the 
opportunity.  Ambassador met with President Bolanos and 
Foreign Minister Caldera on June 2 and also raised the issue. 
 Bolanos reiterated GON support for the U.S. effort.  Caldera 
assured Ambassador that the GON's public statement will be 
released shortly.
