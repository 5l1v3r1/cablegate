Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) Throughout the last year, U.S. and other 
international investors have been embroiled in a bitter 
dispute over control of the Board of Directors of one of the 
largest and most successful microfinance institutions in 
Nicaragua, the Association for the Development of Small, 
Medium and Micro Businesses (ACODEP).  The Board removed the 
outgoing president of ACODEP in 2008 for embezzlement and 
poor lending decisions.  In retribution, he exploited his 
senior-level GON contacts to have himself "legally" 
reinstated as president for a two-month period in 2009. 
During these two months, according to the current Board and 
its investors, he embezzled $3 to $5 million of the 
association's assets, partially facilitated by officials from 
one of the country's largest banks.  Disturbingly, none of 
these transactions appears to have triggered Nicaraguan banks 
to file suspicious activity reports, which by law were 
required because many of the transactions surpassed the 
$10,000 mark.  While ACODEP finally succeeded in removing 
this individual as president in late May and obtained an 
official certification establishing a newly-constituted Board 
backed by its investors, the financial damage done to the 
institution as a result of this alleged embezzlement is 
severe.  ACODEP'S  current president believes it will 
survive.  Meanwhile, the new Board has filed a criminal 
complaint against the former president with the Nicaraguan 
National Police, which is investigating the matter.  End 
summary. 
 
ACODEP: A Model of Microfinance Success... 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) On June 17, econoff met with Julio Paniagua Lopez, 
President of the Board of Directors for the Association for 
the Development of Small, Medium and Micro Businesses 
(ACODEP), a prominent Nicaraguan microfinance institution 
(MFI) which provides loans to agricultural producers and 
family-run businesses.  ACODEP maintains 40 branches 
throughout Nicaragua and has approximately $25 million in 
assets and about 57,000 clients, ranking it among the top 
three MFIs in the country.  It has operated since 1990 and 
offers loans as small as $100 to some of the poorest 
Nicaraguans who otherwise have no access to credit.  ACODEP 
is a member in good standing of the Association of Nicaraguan 
Microfinance Institutions (ASOMIF), a nineteen-member 
organization which represents and advocates on behalf of the 
industry here. 
 
¶3.  (C) ACODEP's primary investors, all international, 
include the following: 
 
--Global Partnerships, a Seattle-based non-profit 
organization which works in 26 Latin American countries. 
 
--Developing World Markets, based in Connecticut, a "socially 
oriented" investment bank that channels capital to MFIs in 
over 20 countries worldwide. 
 
--The Wisconsin Coordinating Council on Nicaragua, a 
non-profit organization headquarted in Madison, WI, which 
focuses almost exclusively on funding MFIs in Nicaragua. 
 
--Deutsche Bank's Office of Social Investment Funds. 
 
--Symbiotics, a Swiss company that specializes in 
microfinance investment funds. 
 
All of these investors visit Nicaragua regularly or maintain 
representative offices in Managua.  We also understand that 
the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has 
provided approximately $2 million in financing to ACODEP via 
some of the abovementioned U.S. investors. 
 
...But as Nicaraguan Investments Go, Caveat Emptor 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶4.  (C) Despite ACODEP's successful history, during the last 
year ACODEP's investors have engaged in a bitter dispute over 
control of ACODEP's Board of Directors and its Nicaraguan 
bank accounts.  At the center of the dispute is Armando Jose 
Garcia Campos, a founder of ACODEP who served as its 
president for almost twenty years.  According to current 
President Paniagua--and the aforementioned investors--an 
internal audit in 2008 revealed that Garcia had embezzled 
thousands of dollars from ACODEP during the previous few 
years and had made a series of very poor lending decisions, 
which severely damaged the association's balance sheet.  The 
ACODEP Board of Directors initially attempted to negotiate a 
graceful exit for Garcia, but when they discovered additional 
evidence of more serious embezzlement, negotiations broke 
down and Garcia was relieved of his position. 
 
¶5.  (C) In response, in February 2009, Garcia exploited his 
close relationship with Nicaraguan Attorney General Hernan 
Estrada and the Ministry of Governance (MIGOB) to have 
himself "reinstated" as president of ACODEP on very dubious 
grounds.   MIGOB serves as the GON's oversight body for 
microfinance institutions and is headed by Sandinista 
loyalist Ana Isabel Morales.  On February 27, Garcia seized 
ACODEP offices in Managua by force using armed security 
personnel, and he took control of its assets.  During the 
subsequent months of March and April, according to Paniagua 
and his investors, Garcia orchestrated the embezzlement of 
between $3 to $5 million dollars, essentially liquidating 
ACODEP's bank accounts.  One apparent beneficiary of the 
embezzlement scheme was Alfonso Llanes, former head of the 
Nicaraguan Superintendency of Banks (SIBOIF).  Paniagua 
alleges that Llanes collected $250,000 for 3 weeks of work in 
"wages" from Garcia during his temporary reinstatement as 
head of ACODEP.  Documentation provided by Paniagua suggests 
that Llanes' wife, Sheila Llanes, who works as General 
Manager at BanCentro's largest branch in Nicaragua, 
facilitated the scheme by cashing all of these checks. 
 
ACODEP Responds 
--------------- 
 
¶6.  (C) ACODEP's Board of Directors and investors engaged in 
a full-court press against Garcia and hired a Nicaraguan 
attorney who filed numerous complaints from February through 
April with MIGOB regarding Garcia's actions to no avail.  In 
addition, Paniagua sent letters of protest to BanCentro and 
BanPro (Nicaragua,s two largest banks), where Garcia opened 
various shell accounts in different names to further 
facilitate his embezzlement scheme.  Moreover, according to 
Paniagua, many of Garcia's transactions were well above 
$10,000, which according to Nicaraguan law should have 
triggered suspicious activity reports for submission to the 
country's bank regulator, (SIBOIF); these reports were 
apparently never filed.  Paniagua provided econoff a letter 
he delivered to SIBOIF on June 1, in which he laid out these 
concerns.  Note:  On June 16 econoff met with SIBOIF's 
President, Victor Urcuyo, who said he was unaware of the 
ACODEP situation.  End Note. 
 
Current Status 
-------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) Finally, after much back and forth with MIGOB, ACODEP 
 successfully removed Garcia from the Board of Directors and 
obtained an official certification on May 25 naming Paniagua 
as the new president.  Paniagua told econoff that he believes 
this certification puts an end to Garcia's involvement with 
ACODEP, primarily because "there is nothing left for him to 
steal."  While ACODEP's accounts have now been unfrozen at 
BanCentro, Garcia still retains control over an account at 
BanPro.  On May 29, ACODEP filed a criminal complaint against 
Garcia with the Nicaraguan National Police,s Economic Crimes 
Division.  One of ACODEP's primary investors indicated to 
econoff that the police have started to interview individuals 
who aided Garcia during his two-month embezzlement and 
seizure of ACODEP,s assets.  He said this could lead to a 
criminal case against Garcia, though this is far from certain 
given Nicaragua,s highly politicized judicial system. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  (C) If the allegations against Mr. Garcia are true--and 
the documentation we have reviewed suggests that they are--it 
appears that he and his accomplices came close to destroying 
one of Nicaragua's most prominent microfinance institutions. 
While Paniagua and his investors believe they can weather the 
damage done to their balance sheet, they face additional 
challenges such as the "No Pago" movement (reftels) and the 
credit crunch posed by the global financial crisis.  As a 
result of the ACODEP affair, the damage done to investor 
confidence in Nicaragua's microfinance sector is severe, as 
are the losses that U.S. charitable organizations and OPIC 
have suffered in the process.
