SUBJECT: PEACE CORPS DIRECTOR MEETS WITH PRESIDENT ORTEGA
 
¶1. Summary.  On September 4, Peace Corps Director Aaron 
Williams met with President Daniel Ortega to review the work 
of the Peace Corps in Nicaragua as well as to provide 
observations from his September 2-4 visit and to discuss 
areas for future cooperation.  After expressing concern about 
the ongoing crisis in Honduras and the presence of the U.S. 
military on Colombian bases, Ortega praised the work of the 
Peace Corps and its work to improve conditions in some of 
Nicaragua's poorest communities.  Director Williams 
emphasized that the Peace Corps is committed to working with 
Nicaragua to help people in these communities and will look 
for new ways to expand its work in the country.  Education, 
Health and Agriculture Ministers similarly lauded the work of 
Peace Corps and USAID in helping to foster Nicaragua's 
development.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. Ortega opened the meeting noting the emergency situation 
facing Nicaragua due to the spread of H1N1 virus, which had 
even affected members of his own household.  Ortega 
reiterated the GON's concerns over the ongoing crisis in 
Honduras and welcomed the recent U.S. decision to cut 
assistance to the de facto government.  In addition, he 
emphasized that "all of Latin America" is worried about the 
presence of the U.S. military at bases in Colombia.  Turning 
to the Peace Corps, Ortega welcomed the visit of Director 
Williams and praised the history and ongoing programs of the 
Corps in Nicaragua.  Ortega recalled how the Peace Corps 
remained credible and active in Nicaragua through the 1960s 
and 1970s and emphasized that the direct engagement of Peace 
Corps volunteers in Nicaragua's poorest communities was vital 
to Nicaragua's continued development. 
 
¶3. Director Williams thanked Ortega for the opportunity to 
meet and noted that Nicaragua was the second country he had 
visited as Director (after the Dominican Republic), a 
testament to the success of the programs in the country. 
Williams emphasized that the Peace Corps, and the U.S. 
Government, is committed to working "arm in arm" with 
Nicaragua to help people in the poorest communities and that 
he would continue to look for new ways to continue the work. 
 
¶4.  Education Minister de Castilla lauded the work of the 
Peace Corps and USAID in helping to improve Nicaragua's 
education system.  Calling the Peace Corps' programs 
"extraordinary," De Castilla noted the successes of the Peace 
Corps, especially in the areas of entrepreneurship training 
for secondary students and English-language training. 
Furthermore, De Castilla praised the work of USAID's 
"Excellencia" program and work in curriculum development. 
Without USAID's help, De Castilla added, "it would have been 
impossible to transform the curriculum."  Building on the 
same theme, Agriculture Minister Bucardo noted the work of 
the Peace Corps in directly helping communities address 
environmental issues, particularly water problems as 
Nicaragua faces ongoing challenges of drought and lack of 
access to clean water.  Finally, Health Minister Gonzalez 
noted the community-level contributions of the Peace Corps in 
various areas of preventive health, including maternal-child 
care and HIV/AIDS prevention. 
 
¶5. Ortega concluded the meeting by noting that the visit of 
Peace Corps Director Williams demonstrated that "despite our 
differences, we (the U.S. and Nicaragua) are working 
together, not just in counter-narcotics, but also to 
eradicate poverty, to open up new space for cooperation, and 
to build confidence between our two countries."
