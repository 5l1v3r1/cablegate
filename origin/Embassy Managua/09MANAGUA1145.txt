SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) The Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN) released a 2009 mid-year 
foreign assistance report on 
 
December 3 which included a special section on Venezuelan 
assistance via the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA). 
The BCN reported that the Government of Nicaragua (GON) received 
$283 million in assistance from Venezuela during the first six 
months of 2009, an increase of $71 million versus the same period 
in 2008.  Most of the new assistance comes from the ALBA 
"Solidarity Program," established to substitute the Millennium 
Challenge Corporation's (MCC) termination of $62 million in 
assistance for Nicaragua in June.  The International Monetary Fund 
has routinely expressed concern regarding the GON's lack of 
transparency in the use of ALBA funds.  The presence of large 
amounts of Venezuelan cash circulating in the Nicaraguan monetary 
system is an additional concern, as it could stimulate inflationary 
pressure.  BCN officials privately complain that the GON's 
non-compliance with budgetary regulations regarding Venezuelan 
assistance, and its reluctance to address the fraudulent November 
2008 municipal elections, might further alienate bilateral and 
multilateral donors to provide much-needed assistance for the GON's 
social programs. 
 
 
 
CENTRAL BANK REPORTS 2009 VENEZUELAN FOREIGN ASSISTANCE 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶2. (U) On December 3, the Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN) released 
its 2009 mid-year foreign 
 
assistance report to Nicaragua, which included a special two-page 
section on Venezuelan assistance via the Bolivarian Alliance for 
the Americas (ALBA).  The two-page section, entitled "Venezuelan 
Cooperation," is broken down into four broad categories: petroleum 
cooperation, bilateral cooperation, ALBA Solidarity, and foreign 
direct investment.  According to the BCN report, Venezuela provided 
$283 million to the GON during the first six months of 2009, an 
increase of $71 million over the same period in 2008.  The report 
can be accessed at http://www.bcn.gob.ni

ALBA SOLIDARITY PROGRAM 
 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) On June 13, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced the 
creation of the ALBA Solidarity 
 
Program to help the GON continue road construction and property 
titling projects terminated by the Millennium Challenge Corporation 
(MCC) in June.  MCC's funds were terminated as a result of the 
fraudulent Nicaraguan elections in November 2008 (Ref A).  ALBA 
Solidarity donated $50 million for these projects: $35 million for 
road construction in the department of Leon, and $15 million for 
property titling in the departments of Leon and Rivas.  [Note: The 
World Bank plans to provide an additional $10 million in loans to 
support the property titling program in several departments.  End 
Note.]  ALBA Solidarity blatantly copied the direct administration 
model developed by MCC for Nicaragua to implement the projects. 
 
 
IMF REACTION 
 
------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) The International Monetary Fund (IMF), under its Poverty 
Reduction and Growth Facility, 
 
has repeatedly pressed the GON to account, or at least provide an 
approximation of, the inflow of Venezuelan funds (Refs B and C). 
On December 10, Luis Cubeddu, Deputy Division Chief of the IMF's 
Western Hemisphere Department, told Econoff that the BCN foreign 
assistance report was a direct result of the IMF's pressure on the 
GON to account for these funds in a more transparent manner.  A 
primary concern for the IMF is the potential for inflationary 
pressure in Nicaragua as a result of a large amount of Venezuelan 
cash flowing into its monetary system. 
 
 
 
ALIENATING OTHER DONORS 
 
----------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) Mario Gonzalez, Chief Executive Officer of Invercasa, a 
stock brokerage company, and 
 
member of the BCN board of directors, told Econoff he worries that 
the GON's lack of transparency might further alienate bilateral and 
multilateral donors, with the exception of Venezuela.  He stated 
that the FY 2010 budget contains a deficit of $280 million, which 
the GON assumes will be filled by donors (septel).  Jose de Jesus 
Rojas, General Manager of the BCN, acknowledged that donors are 
losing patience with the GON's lack of transparency on budgetary 
and political issues.  He noted that donors are becoming more 
reluctant to provide assistance for FY 2010 until the GON answers 
questions on the use of Venezuelan assistance and the fraudulent 
November 2008 municipal elections. 
 
 
 
COMMENT 
 
------- 
 
¶7. (C) The GON is under pressure from international donors to be 
more transparent about 
 
Venezuelan assistance as rumors abound that a significant portion 
of Venezuelan funds enter Nicaragua through unofficial channels. 
In addition, donors seek to ensure free and fair elections in 2010 
and 2011.  Despite these concerns, however, the GON refuses to 
account for these funds through the budgetary process and risks 
losing much-needed donor assistance in FY 2010.  We believe that 
President Ortega and his Sandinista National Liberation Front 
(FSLN) Party will continue to stonewall critics of ALBA assistance 
to Nicaragua because these funds finance FSLN political patronage 
and business enterprises designed to ensure Ortega's reelection in 
¶2011.
