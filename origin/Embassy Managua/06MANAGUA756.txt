SUBJECT: NICARAGUA SUPPORTS PSI INITIATIVE 
 
REF: STATE 50811 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
C) On April 4, Ambassador approached Nicaraguan Foreign 
Minister Norman Caldera on GON interest in President Bush's 
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) and explained that 
the next senior-level meeting will be held in Poland in June. 
 Caldera welcomed the initiative and expressed interest in 
Nicaragua's participation.  He understands that the next step 
is the GON's endorsement of the PSI Statement of Interdiction 
Principles, and he will draw on the supporting procedural 
materials the Ambassador shared with him.
