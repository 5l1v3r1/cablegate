SUBJECT: ARCHBISHOP BRENES SHARES VIEWS ON ELECTIONS, 
DEMOCRACY 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  On June 26, Assistant Secretary Shannon 
discussed with Archbishop Leopoldo Brenes Solorzano the 
Archbishop's perspectives on democracy and governance in 
Nicaragua and the upcoming November 5 elections.  Brenes 
hoped the elections would be fair, peaceful, and inclusive, 
and voiced concern over the lack of citizen access to the 
national ID (cedula) required to vote.  A/S Shannon 
reiterated that the USG does not endorse any particular 
presidential candidate, but is helping Nicaraguans ensure 
that their elections are fair and transparent.  Shannon 
suggested that the Catholic Church could play a valuable role 
by promoting voter awareness and encouraging voters to 
consider the "alternative" candidates.  Brenes agreed many 
Nicaraguans seek new political options rather than the stale 
offers of Nicaragua's two traditional parties and shared his 
plan to release an official Church statement in August, 
urging Nicaraguans to vote, scrutinize each candidate's past, 
and examine the party platforms.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C) During A/S Shannon's meeting with Archbishop Brenes, 
the Archbishop said he hoped Nicaragua's elections would be 
fair, peaceful, and inclusive.  Brenes, voiced concern over 
the lack of citizen access to the national ID (cedula), which 
is required to vote.  Brenes said the cedula problem is 
particularly acute in Matagalpa and Jinotega, where many 
citizens do not have birth certificates, a prerequisite for 
cedulas.  He suggested that priests could use their rapport 
with parishioners to help citizens obtain their cedulas. 
 
¶3.  (C) Brenes shared his impression that many Nicaraguans 
seek political alternatives to the traditional Liberal 
Constitutional Party (PLC) and Sandinista Liberation Front 
(FSLN).  He underscored the Catholic Church's interest in 
fostering a more educated electorate to help voters make 
better choices.  Brenes shared his plan to release an 
official Church "Carta Episcopal" in August -- urging 
Nicaraguans to exercise their right to vote, scrutinize each 
candidate's past, and examine party platforms. 
 
¶4.  (C) Shannon reiterated that the USG does not endorse any 
presidential candidate, but is helping Nicaraguans ensure 
that their elections are fair and transparent.  To this end, 
the U.S. is supporting and working with the OAS.  Shannon 
suggested that the Catholic Church could play a valuable role 
by promoting voter awareness and encouraging voters to 
consider alternative candidates running for office. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Archbishop Brenes discussed at length the 
importance of the radio -- which the Sandinistas have 
effectively utilized -- as the key communications medium in 
Nicaraguan society.  He explained that Nicaraguans, 
especially in rural areas, rely on the radio much more than 
television or newspapers to obtain information -- as 
evidenced by the presence of a radio in almost every 
Nicaraguan home.  He said the Catholic Church operates Radio 
Catolica and Radio Maria to inform the public. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) With respect to his pastoral duties, Brenes said he 
is rarely in his office, preferring to dedicate his time at 
the local parishes where he enjoys direct contact with his 
people.  He said the Catholic Church works hard to achieve a 
sense of trust and confidence between its priests and their 
parishioners.  Brenes contrasted his own modus operandi with 
that of many National Assembly delegates who, after being 
elected, go to Managua and lose contact with the problems of 
poverty and other concerns of their departments.  He hoped 
that the next group of political leaders would maintain more 
contact with their constituents and respond to people's needs 
and concerns. 
 
¶7.  (C) Shannon said the United States strives to show its 
commitment to democracy and human rights in Nicaragua through 
mutual respect and diplomacy.  When queried over the U.S. 
image in Nicaragua, the Archbishop replied that the U.S. is 
perceived as "a force commanding respect."  USAID programs 
have done much to build visible good will and created a 
positive image toward the United States, opined Brenes. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Following his meeting with Shannon, the Archbishop, 
left for the nearby Santo Domingo Church to celebrate a feast 
day mass in honor of Opus Dei founder Jose Maria Escriva.
