SUBJECT: PRESIDENT BOLANOS VETOS ASSEMBLY REFORM LAW 
 
REF: MANAGUA 2696 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Responding to civil society demands, 
Nicaraguan President Enrique Bolanos vetoed the National 
Assembly's recently passed ways and means bill ("Ley 
Organica").  The veto met with mixed response in the 
Assembly, but ultimately the Sandinista Front (FSLN) and 
Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC) deputies decided to call 
for a special session of the Assembly to override the veto. 
The Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance (ALN) is investigating ways 
to derail or delay the vote.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) President Bolanos vetoed the Ley Organica (reftel) on 
December 18, calling it "anti-democratic" and "somewhat 
dictatorial."  Bolanos justified the veto by claiming that 
the Assembly was attempting to grant itself the 
unconstitutional authority to summon private citizens, and 
also to strip individual deputies of the power to present 
bills to the Assembly's Executive Board by transferring this 
right exclusively to caucus chiefs. 
 
¶3. (U) The reaction of the National Assembly deputies to the 
veto has been mixed.  Deputies in the Nicaraguan Liberal 
Alliance (ALN) caucus agreed with Bolanos that the bill is 
unconstitutional.  Maximino Rodriguez, the likely future head 
of the Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC) caucus, responded 
that the President has a constitutional right to veto bills, 
and the PLC has not yet decided how to respond.  Sandinista 
Front (FSLN) deputy and Executive Board vice president Rene 
Nunez stated that the FSLN will call for a special session of 
the Assembly to override Bolanos' veto. 
 
¶4. (C) On December 19, PLC deputy and first secretary of the 
Assembly's Executive Board Maria Auxiliadora Aleman, with the 
support of the FSLN Board members, called on the deputies to 
meet in special sessions on December 21 and 23.  ALN deputy 
Miguel Lopez informed us that the ALN is attempting to track 
down ALN-affiliated Assembly president Eduardo Gomez and 
bring him back from vacation abroad to attempt to block the 
special sessions.  Lopez stated that Aleman did not define an 
agenda for the sessions, but business will undoubtedly 
include a vote to override the Ley Organica veto and possibly 
other prejudicial votes cooked up by the FSLN-PLC pact before 
more opposition deputies join the Assembly next year. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The President and Assembly caucuses disagree on the 
Executive Board's authority to call a special session. 
Bolanos and the ALN contend that only the President of the 
Republic may convoke the Assembly after the official closing 
of the session (which occurred on December 15).  The FSLN 
argues that the Executive Board may convoke the session. 
According to the National Assembly's procedural regulations, 
the Assembly technically remains in session during the final 
year of its term until the new Assembly is inaugurated -- 
which seems to support the FSLN's interpretation. 
 
¶6. (C) Comment: Senior Assembly functionary Armando Garcia 
reported that President-elect Daniel Ortega is upset that 
Bolanos reneged on an agreement to ignore the bill, which 
would have allowed the Assembly to enact it without a vote to 
override the veto.  Robust civil society pressure has forced 
the PLC and FSLN to back away from some of the more 
controversial elements of the bill, and may sway the new 
Assembly to scrap it altogether if the FSLN and PLC are not 
able to orchestrate a vote to override Bolanos' veto before 
January 9.
