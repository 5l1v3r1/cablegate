Summary 
 
¶1.   (SBU) The Nicaraguan Army has dispatched 34 soldiers to Haiti 
to assist with search and rescue efforts.  Nicaragua also delivered 
9 metric tons of foodstuffs and 9 metric tons of medical supplies. 
President Ortega has criticized the U.S. relief effort, describing 
it as a military invasion and claiming that our intent is to 
install a military base in Haiti.  Post has complained about these 
false statements to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MINREX) officials 
and requested an opportunity to brief government officials on U.S. 
relief efforts in Haiti.   Media coverage, with the exception of 
that provided by government-controlled outlets, has been relatively 
balanced to date; nonetheless, post is using television and print 
media to provide accurate information to the Nicaraguan public 
about our relief efforts. 
 
 
 
Aid Coordination 
 
¶2.  (U) On January 19, Econcouns contacted Renee Morales, Director 
for North America at MINREX, to request that Nicaragua use the 
United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(OCHA) Financial Tracking System (FTS) to coordinate assistance 
that Nicaragua provides to Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake 
there (Ref B).  Morales agreed to communicate the information 
provided, including the website address for FTS, to those 
responsible for coordinating assistance.  She stated that on 
January 14, Nicaragua dispatched a "Solidarity Brigade" comprising 
32 soldiers of the Nicaraguan Army to assist in search and rescue 
efforts.  Government-owned media outlet "El 19" has reported that 
the brigade has rescued 4 Haitians from collapsed buildings since 
arriving.  The team also delivered 3 metric tons of foodstuffs, 
including beans, rice and cooking oil according to "El 19." 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) First Lady Rosario Murillo announced on January 18 that the 
Nicaraguan military would deliver a second shipment of commodities 
to Haiti, including an additional 6 metric tons of foodstuff as 
well as 9 metric tons of medical supplies.  She also said that the 
brigade currently in Nicaragua, under the command of the Nicaraguan 
Army, would be expanded to include doctors and other health care 
specialists. 
 
 
 
Setting the Record Straight on U.S. Relief Efforts 
 
¶4.  (U) On January 15, President Ortega accused the United States 
of "manipulating a drama to put U.S. troops in Haiti."  He is 
worried that U.S. troops have already taken over the airport in 
Port au Prince, and U.S. naval vessels have encircled the country. 
He claimed that the United States is looking to take advantage of 
the tragedy in Haiti to install a military base there.  "It makes 
no sense that U.S. troops are landing in Haiti," Ortega said, and 
"I hope they will withdraw these troops, because by occupying 
Haiti, the United States is occupying Latin American and Caribbean 
territory." 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Econcouns complained to MINREX's Morales that President 
Ortega's characterization of U.S. relief efforts as a military 
occupation were false and counterproductive to the efforts of the 
international community to deliver much-needed assistance to Haiti. 
After briefly describing the extent of U.S. humanitarian relief 
efforts, he offered to provide Morales and other government 
officials a comprehensive briefing to set the record straight on 
our assistance, including our efforts to coordinate with the 
Haitian Government and the international community. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (U) During a January 20 interview on a local television show, 
the Charge d'Affaires described our relief efforts in Haiti, 
emphasizing the humanitarian nature of our mission and the 
importance of coordination with local authorities and the 
international community.  On January 21, we will discuss U.S. 
relief efforts in Haiti with reporters from Nicaraguan newspapers 
"La Prensa" and "El Nuevo Diario." 
 
 
 
Comment 
 
¶7. (SBU) MINREX is unlikely to respond to our request that we be 
allowed to brief Nicaraguan officials on our relief efforts, but if 
given the opportunity, we will make clear the negative reaction 
that the comments President Ortega made on January 15 have 
engendered within the USG.  To date, with the exception of 
government-controlled media such as "El 19," coverage of our relief 
efforts in Haiti has been relatively fair and balanced. 
Nonetheless, post will continue to provide information to local 
media on U.S. relief efforts to counteract Ortega's misinformation.
