Summary 
------- 

¶1. (C) Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's association with 
the Cuban regime spans several decades.  Since Ortega 
returned to power in January 2007, Nicaragua has 
re-established very close relations with Cuba, especially 
through common membership in the Bolivarian Alternative for 
the Americas (ALBA).  Ortega frequently lauds the Cuban 
socialist model in his public speeches.  While trade between 
the two countries is limited, Cuba sponsors important 
training and exchange programs in health and education.  End 
summary. 
 
Cuba, Nicaragua, and the Revolutionary Brotherhood 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 

¶2. (C) Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's association with 
the Cuban regime spans several decades.  Upon release from 
prison, Ortega spent several months in exile in Cuba during 
the 1970s.  When the FSLN rose to power, Ortega looked to 
Cuban-style socialism for direction.  Throughout the 1980s, 
the two countries enjoyed close economic, political, and 
military cooperation.  After losing the 1990 elections, 
Ortega traveled to Cuba frequently and continued to maintain 
close relationships with senior Cuban officials, including 
Fidel Castro. 
 
¶3. (C) Reflecting ideological and historical affinities with 
the Cuban regime, Ortega moved immediately after taking 
office in January 2007 to join Cuba, Venezuela, and Bolivia 
as the fourth member of the Bolivarian Alternative for the 
Americas (ALBA).  Through this forum, President Ortega 
maintains regular contact with high-level Cuban officials. 
Most recently, on November 26, 2008, Ortega participated with 
Ricardo Cabrisas, Vice President of the Cuban Council of 
Ministers, in an ALBA summit held in Caracas, Venezuela. 
There, he likened Nicaragua's battles against European and 
"Yankee" interventionism to Cuba's struggle against the U.S. 
trade embargo and international isolation since its 
revolution.  In a televised speech on September 20, 2008, 
Ortega favorably remarked that "Cuba is without question an 
extraordinary example of a socialist project in the Latin 
American and Caribbean context."  Esteban Lazo Hernandez, 
Vice President of the Cuban Council of State, participated in 
a ceremony held in Managua on July 19, 2008, to commemorate 
the 29th anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution. 
 
¶4. (C) Nicaraguan Ambassador to Cuba Luis Cabrera, Argentine 
by birth but a close confidant of President Ortega, 
coordinates the bilateral relationship at a working level. 
Press reports identify Cabrera as the point of contact for 
President Ortega with the FARC, according to documents seized 
by Colombian Armed Forces from the FARC in 2008. 
 
Trade and Investment 
-------------------- 

¶5. (U) Nicaraguan-Cuban bilateral trade declined steadily 
from 1991 to 2005 but has increased since 2007.  Nicaraguan 
exports to Cuba in 2007 totaled $700,000, up from $400,000 in 
¶2006.  Nicaraguan imports from Cuba rose from $1 million in 
2006, before Ortega took office, to $6.3 million in 2007. 
Primary imports included energy-efficient light bulbs, 
medical equipment, and pharmaceuticals.  Two-way trade, 
however, remains insignificant, representing 0.1% percent of 
Nicaragua's total trade worldwide.  Nicaragua's investment 
promotion agency, ProNicaragua, reports no significant Cuban 
investment in Nicaragua. 
 
Training and Scholarships 
------------------------- 

¶6. (C) As a legacy of FSLN rule during the 1980s, Cuba and 
Nicaragua regularly collaborate on health and education 
programs.  Since Ortega took office in January 2007, that 
collaboration has also intensified: 

--According to Nicaraguan Minister of Health Guillermo 
Gonzalez, as of July 2008 there were 250 Cuban medical 
personnel working throughout Nicaragua -- up from 140 just 
six months before -- with the largest concentration along the 
Atlantic coast. 
 
--Through "Operation Miracle," Nicaraguan Government 
officials claim that Cuban doctors, with Venezuelan funding, 
have performed cataract surgery for more than 20,000 
Nicaraguans. 
 
--Under a long-standing agreement, any member of the 
Nicaraguan military can receive free medical treatment in 
Havana, though in practice most are served by local military 
hospitals and seek specialized care in the United States. 
 
--For years, Cuba has offered full scholarships to Nicaraguan 
students to attend Cuban universities.  According to press 
reports, as many as 1,000 Nicaraguan students are currently 
studying in Cuba, mostly medicine. 
 
--Cuban teachers seconded to Nicaragua also participate in a 
rural literacy program in Nicaragua called "Yes, I Can." 
 
Comment 
------- 

¶7. (C) While President Ortega's ideological and historical 
affinities with the Cuban regime make the two natural allies, 
it is ALBA that provides the framework for the relationship 
and Venezuelan funding that facilitates programs at the 
operational level (Ref B).
