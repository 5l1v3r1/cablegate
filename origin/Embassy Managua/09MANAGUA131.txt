SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW IMPORT 
REGULATIONS FOR CARIBBEAN SPINY LOBSTER 
 
REF: SECSTATE 4147 
 
(U) On January 29, Econoff delivered reftel demarche to 
Steadman Fagoth, Executive Director of the Nicaraguan 
National Institute of Fisheries and Aquaculture (INPESCA). 
INPESCA is the government organization that oversees all 
activities related to fishing in Nicaragua.  Fagoth reacted 
positively to the demarche and said that Nicaragua has 
already set minimum size limits for Caribbean spiny lobster, 
and has long urged all lobster-exporting countries in the 
region to adopt similar regulations.  Econoff also delivered 
a Spanish translation of the demarche to the Nicaraguan 
Chamber of Fisheries (CAPENIC), the private sector 
organization representing the fishing industry.  CAPENIC 
approves of the regulations and anticipates no repercussions 
for Nicaragua.  Caribbean spiny lobster is the Nicaraguan 
Caribbean coast's major seafood export and the industry is 
being hit hard by the global economic downturn. 
Nevertheless, both INPESCA and CAPENIC believe that they 
stand to benefit in the long run from the establishment of 
uniform minimum size limits for lobster throughout the region.
