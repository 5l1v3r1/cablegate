Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Prominent indigenous activist Javier Williams 
Slate warns the Ortega Administration is aggressively 
consolidating power in the North Atlantic Autonomous Region 
(RAAN) to secure a route for their Venezuelan allies to 
transport oil to the Pacific.  According to Williams, 
Venezuelan delegations are visiting the North Atlantic 
Autonomous Region (RAAN) with increasing frequency under the 
cover of a road building agreement, and could soon establish 
a permanent presence in Puerto Cabezas.  He also observed 
that narcotraffickers who had earlier left the area to 
experiment with Pacific Coast routes are beginning to return. 
 End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Creole/Miskito indigenous leader and former Vice 
Foreign Minister Javier Williams Slate requested a meeting 
with Ambassador on March 15 to discuss his concerns with the 
Sandinistas' growing influence and increasing Venezuelan 
presence in the RAAN.  Williams commented that he has been 
meeting discreetly with community leaders to plan for the 
November 2008 municipal elections, in an effort to reverse 
Sandinista gains in the area.  He said that he would not run 
personally, but mentioned the need to "find the best 
candidate soon." 
 
¶3. (C) Williams claimed that current Puerto Cabezas mayor 
Elizabeth Henriquez has been "discredited" by her association 
with the branch of Yatama (the Miskito indigenous party) that 
formed an alliance with the FSLN in 2006 and her U.S. visa 
revocation.  Conversely, the Yatama faction headed by 
Comandante Blas that allied with the ALN has "considerable 
support," but is likely infiltrated by paid informants who 
could derail the organization.  Williams stated that Blas and 
others were able to block the FSLN's attempts to gain control 
over the Moravian Church leadership (reftel), but he feels 
that even that institution could be susceptible to bribery 
given the extreme lack of resources on the Coast. 
 
¶4. (C) The FSLN is determined to win the Puerto Cabezas 
mayoral race, Williams explained, to safeguard the oil 
storage facilities at the port and the RAAN road building 
project sponsored by Venezuela.  He commented that Venezuelan 
delegations have frequented the RAAN recently and could soon 
open a permanent office in Puerto Cabezas.  Williams believes 
the motivation for Venezuela's interest in the region is 
developing an alternative Caribbean-Pacific route to ship oil 
to China.  He is concerned that the Sandinistas may use the 
Venezuelans to push an indoctrination campaign and sway the 
sympathies of the population.  Williams claimed that people 
on the Atlantic Coast still tend to be anti-Sandinista and 
are concerned about President Ortega's recent criticisms of 
the U.S. government. 
 
¶5. (C) Ambassador inquired about Williams perception of 
narcotrafficking activity in the region.  He responded that 
drug shipments seemed to have diminished for some time, but 
are now on the increase after several interdictions on the 
Pacific Coast.  Williams commented that the fishing season 
will close from April 15 to July 15, during which time it 
will be more difficult for traffickers to operate 
clandestinely on the Atlantic Coast. 
 
¶6. (C) Comment: Although the Sandinistas are generally 
reviled by the indigenous peoples of the Atlantic Coast for 
human rights abuses committed during the 1980s civil war, 
most of the population lives in dire poverty and is 
susceptible to Sandinista overtures that come with practical 
benefits (better roads, for instance).  We are seeking ways 
to increase the visibility of U.S. assistance in the Atlantic 
Coast region.
