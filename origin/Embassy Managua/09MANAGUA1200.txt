¶1.  (SBU) Per ref A, below is Embassy Managua's 2009 TIP interim 
assessment for Nicaragua.  In preparation for this report PolOff 
requested a meeting with the Government of Nicaragua's (GoN) 
Coordinator for the National Coalition Against Trafficking in 
Persons (NCATIP), however, the Coordinator stated the request for 
the meeting needed to be directed to the Minister of Government. 
The Minister has yet to respond to our request, and the Coordinator 
would not respond to our questions without first receiving approval 
to do so from the Minister.  The following information is based on 
discussions with other government offices and civil society groups, 
as well as media reports. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to the Public Ministry's Executive Director 
Delia Rosales, thus far in calendar year 2009 the Ministry has five 
trafficking cases in process, but as of yet no convictions.  She 
reported no cases against government officials who may be suspected 
of complicity in trafficking.  The government does not effectively 
enforce the law against forced labor or implement programs to 
combat forced labor. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) With regard to victims' assistance, the GoN has not dedicated any additional resources. As reported in ref C, in October 2008, the GoN announced a new program under the Ministry of Family for the general welfare of children and adolescents ("Programa Amor" or Program Love). One of the stated objectives of this program was to assist victims of trafficking. The Ministry has not made public any information on the program, but local NGOs observe that the program was not allotted the necessary resources (financial or human). Media report that the Ministry informed some children's shelters that they would no longer receive the government subsidy for the shelter. In the past the Ministry has used these shelters for victims of trafficking. The Ministry informed us that they do not have victims' assistance programs for adults, but said that the Ministry of Government (through the NCATIP) provides this service. The NCATIP did not make itself available to respond to our questions. The GoN has not conducted any public awareness campaigns in 2009.
