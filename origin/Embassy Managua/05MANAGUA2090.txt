SUBJECT: NICARAGUAN AND WHTI MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 132219 
 
¶1.  On July 15, Post contacted the Nicaraguan Ministry of 
Transportation, which could not confirm receipt of an 
invitation to the Western Hemisphere Transportation 
Initiative (WHTI) Meeting or the attendance of Minister Pedro 
Solorzano at this time. 
 
¶2.  The one pending bilateral transportation issue of 
importance involves civil aviation and the effort to move 
Nicaragua from a Category 2 to Category 1 country rating. 
Last November, the FAA conducted a technical review of the 
Nicaraguan Civil Aviation Administration in preparation for a 
full audit.  Pending legislation in the National Assembly, 
which will modernize Nicaragua's civil aviation authority in 
accordance with ICAO standards, has been delayed since 
October due to political considerations. 
 
¶3.  Post will provide an update if Minister Solorzano 
confirms his attendance at WHTI.
