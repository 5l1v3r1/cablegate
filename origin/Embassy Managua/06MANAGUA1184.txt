Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli.  Reasons 1.4 (b, d) 
 
¶1. (C) During a May 30 meeting with Polcouns and Poloff, 
Raymond Genie and Marcos Carmona from the Nicaraguan 
Permanent Human Rights Commission (CPDH) outlined their 
current activities and plans for their investigation into 
atrocities committed against the Miskito population during 
the 1980s Sandinista era.  The CPDH has completed its visits 
to the Atlantic Coast to investigate the allegations; its 
most recent visit focusing on the area around the 
municipality of Prinzapolka to the south of Puerto Cabezas. 
Thus far, they have gathered written, notarized, and 
video-taped testimony for 89 cases of Sandinista abuses 
against the Miskito, including execution, torture, forced 
relocation, and destruction of property.  CPDH members will 
travel to Puerto Cabezas on June 7 to formally denounce these 
abuses and announce their commitment to bring the cases to 
justice both in Nicaragua (before the Fiscalia and 
Procuraduria) and before the OAS Inter-American Human Rights 
Commission.  They plan on holding a press conference for 
national and international media on June 8; a few survivors 
will recount their experiences.  (Comment: CPDH held their 
first press event right before the March 5 Atlantic Coast 
elections and it may have deterred some voters from voting 
FSLN.  Post believes the June 8 press event will have a 
similar impact.) 
 
¶3. (C) CPDH voiced concerns about the financing of its 
project, noting that they require funds in the immediate term 
to continue their efforts on the cases and to continue work 
on their database of abuses.  Carmona and Genie also 
mentioned that Brooklyn Rivera, one of the original Miskito 
witnesses, has publicly endorsed Daniel Ortega and will be 
running as an FSLN deputy (ranks fourth on the national 
list).  CPDH fears that other witnesses may be "bought off" 
by the FSLN, so they believe they must move quickly to make 
the case public. 
 
¶4. (C) Comment:  If CPDH loses momentum for lack of funds at 
this critical juncture, much of the effort could be diluted. 
Miskito leader Blas Coleman has previously told Poloffs that 
other prominent leaders of the Yatama political party, of 
which Coleman is a part, have been co-opted by the FSLN, 
including Steadman Fagoth and party leader Brooklyn Rivera, 
and are doing their utmost to undermine the CPDH 
investigation and persuade Miskitos to change their stories 
in return for FSLN largesse.  According to Coleman, Fagoth is 
openly challenging the investigation and blaming the USG for 
all 1980s rights abuses on the coast, while Rivera is more 
subtly arguing against the CPDH investigation behind the 
scenes. 
 
¶5.  (C) Post understands that funding is forthcoming; we look 
forward to continued progress on this project.
