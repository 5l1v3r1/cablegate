¶1. (SBU) Summary: Post requests that the Department remove Colonel 
Noel Portocarrero from the Section 2225 visa ineligibility file. 
Post has confirmed that Portocarrero resolved his property claim 
dispute with U.S. claimant Juan Barreto when the Government of 
Nicaragua settled the case on November 19.  Mr. Barreto's legal 
representative collected the indemnification bonds (BPIs) on 
December 18.  Please see action request in Paragraph 3. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 19, the Government of Nicaragua settled the 
property claim of U.S. citizen Juan Barreto (Ref A).  Mr. Barreto 
received indemnification bonds (BPIs) with a face value of $3.2 
million as compensation for his 28 properties expropriated by the 
Nicaraguan Army (Ref B).  On December 18, Mr. Barreto's brother and 
legal representative, Samuel Barreto, collected the BPIs from the 
Ministry of Finance.  On December 21, Econoff spoke to Mr. Barreto 
who confirmed that he settled his claims and had received the BPIs. 
Mr. Barreto lives in New Orleans, Louisiana, and may be contacted 
at (504)606-0950 or (504) 866-5536. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Action Request: Post finds sufficient evidence that the 
property dispute between Juan Barreto and Noel Portocarrero has 
been resolved (Ref C).  Thus, we request the Department consider 
removing his name from the Section 2225 visa ineligibility file. 
[Note: Portocarrero currently has no Section 2225-related hits in 
the CLASS visa lookout database.  End Note.]
