SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: FOOD SAFETY MOU DELIVERED 
 
REF: SECSTATE 97072 
 
(U) On September 12, 2008, Post delivered to the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MINREX) the Health and Human Services (HHS) 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on multilateral and 
regional cooperation with regard to the safety of certain 
food, animal feed, cosmetics and medical products under 
HHS/Food and Drug Administration's jurisdiction.  The MOU was 
delivered by diplomatic note making reference to the target 
signing date of the September 29-October 3 Pan American 
Health Organization (PAHO) meeting in Washington. Post will 
follow up with MINREX and the Ministries of Environment, 
Health, and Trade to ensure appropriate distribution and to 
encourage prompt consideration. 
 
(U) We believe that it is unlikely that Nicaragua will be 
prepared to sign the MOU at the PAHO meeting at the end of 
September.  Monday and Tuesday of next week, September 14 and 
15, are official holidays, leaving just eight business days 
for the government to consider the MOU.
