¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Our plan to distribute relief supplies 
outward from Puerto Cabezas went into effect this morning. 
We began moving supplies to Sandy Bay and the surrounding 
area.  As of late afternoon, we had also transported 25,000 
lbs of supplies from Managua to Puerto Cabezas with JTF-B 
helicopters.  Air assets from the USS Wasp also assisted with 
medical evacuation of several severely injured Nicaraguans. 
Total USG disaster relief, not including the value of DOD 
assets, is in excess of USD 1 million.  Distribution 
operations will continue through the weekend.  Media coverage 
of U.S. relief efforts has been extensive and substantial by 
local and international outlets.  The Ambassador plans to 
visit Puerto Cabezas on Saturday, assist with relief efforts 
and meet with Amcits in the affected area.  This will be our 
final SITREP for this week.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CURRENT SITUATION 
----------------- 
 
¶2. (U) AFFECTED PERSONS: The Nicaraguan Government's official 
numbers are as follows:  Total Affected Population: 100,000; 
Confirmed dead: 39; Confirmed Missing: 105; Total Damages 
Houses: 9,948, of which 7,945 were completely destroyed. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) AERIAL OBSERVATIONS: No assessment flights were 
done today along the north-south road below Waspam down to 
Santa Maria and Sisin.  This is the one remaining area over 
which we have not done assessment flights. 
 
USG PLANNING AND RESPONSE 
------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) On September 7 in the early morning, the initial 
distribution of relief supplies commenced in Sandy Bay and 
surrounding affected communities via USS WASP helicopters.  A 
second relief flight departed Miami for Puerto Cabezas 
transporting 120 rolls of plastic sheeting, 1,500 wool 
blankets, and 1,536 hygiene kits.  The USAID/OFDA Military 
Liaison Officer in Nicaragua deployed to Puerto Cabezas to 
assist in the distribution of relief commodities.  A 
USAID/OFDA consultant will be arriving from Honduras to 
assist at the Managua airport with the prioritization of 
relief supplies for loading on U.S. military helicopters to 
Puerto Cabezas.  SINAPRED is coordinating this distribution 
with USAID and U.S. military officials.  The USAID/OFDA field 
team and the Nicaraguan Red Cross (NRC) staff deployed to 
Auastara, Dakura, Pahra, and Sandy Bay communities in 
anticipation of the arrival of relief commodities to 
coordinate efforts with local authorities, DOD officials, and 
non-governmental organizations.  The distribution was 
coordinated as follows: 
 
--Auastara: 23 rolls of plastic sheeting, 245 hygiene kits, 
and 232 wool blankets. 
--Dakura: 23 rolls of plastic sheeting, 245 hygiene kits, and 
240 wool blankets. 
--Pahra: 23 rolls of plastic sheeting, 245 hygiene kits, and 
234 wool blankets. 
--Sandy Bay: 51 rolls of plastic sheeting, 800 hygiene kits, 
and 800 wool blankets. 
 
¶5. (U) The first relief supply distribution brings the total 
USG contribution to Nicaragua for Hurricane Felix to over 
$1,000,000, with USAID/OFDA's share at approximately $275,000 
to date. To date, USAID/OFDA is distributing a total of 240 
rolls of plastic sheeting, 3,000 wool blankets, and 3,072 
hygiene kits.  USAID/OFDA is sending an additional 400 rolls 
of plastic sheeting, tentatively scheduled to arrive on 
September 8.  We are working with country partners to deliver 
the most critical needs.  A $50,000 grant was signed today 
with NRC.  We anticipate an additional $77,800 in grants to 
be signed later today.  USAID is working quickly to identify 
immediate needs of hurricane-affected populations in 
conjunction with its partners to assist in the relief efforts. 
 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY OUTREACH 
------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) The Ambassador spoke with Managua media--TV channels 
2, 12 and 63; newspapers La Prensa, El Nuevo Diario and HOY; 
and Radio Nicaragua, Radio Maranatha, and other independent 
radio stations.  His message included the following points, 
which were reiterated in our daily press release that went 
this afternoon.  His interview was immediately put in our 
Embassy News Service (that we provide to 30 radios stations 
around the country). (Each department has at least two radio 
stations affiliated with this news service). 
 
-- Two U.S. CH-47 helicopters from Soto Cano, Honduras, have 
assisted in carrying to Puerto Cabezas several Nicaraguan 
military and police personnel, as well as U.S. officials to 
make damage assessments and prepare for the receipt and 
onward distribution of relief supplies. 
-- The US Government has also sent one C-12 airplane U.S. and 
Nicaraguan army personnel to assist with mapping the disaster 
zone, collect images of the area and help develop the 
emergency response plan. 
-- The US Southern Command redirected the USS Wasp, which was 
participating in international military exercises in Panama. 
The USS Wasp has six helicopters that are being used to 
provide relief and assistance to the people of Nicaragua. 
-- This U.S. military support is in addition to the efforts 
personnel from the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance 
(OFDA). OFDA is preparing to send from its warehouse in Miami 
humanitarian assistance to Nicaragua. Using a leased airplane 
they sent Thursday to Puerto Cabezas the first delivery with 
plastic sheeting, blankets and hygiene kits. Another airplane 
will arrive Friday with additional donations. Additionally, 
the OFDA had delivered $175,000 USD in assistance, and the 
Nicaraguan Red Cross is now distributing $45,000 of pre 
donation support that was already positioned in the Caribbean 
Coast. 
 
¶7. (U) One final note, in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaraguan 
President Ortega spoke for several minutes to the crew of the 
CH-47 Chinook that arrived there. The encounter was covered 
by all the national and international press (print, radio and 
TV) currently in Puerto Cabezas.  There was at least 30 
minutes of coverage on Nicaraguan channels 63, 2, 8, 11, 10. 
Cable News Channel 100 news continued broadcasting the 
footage throughout the day. 
 
LOOKING AHEAD 
------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Looking forward into the weekend we anticipate 
distribution operations to continue.  USAID/OFDA expects two 
additional supply flights from the U.S. carrying 400 
additional rolls of plastic, as well as blankets.  There will 
be an additional donation of USD 300K towards the UN's USD 
1.3 million flash appeal request.  Finally we expect that two 
of our international NGO partners will begin distributing a 
total of nearly 51 metric tons of food, procured under the 
PL-480 process, to resident in affected areas of Waspam and 
its environs.
