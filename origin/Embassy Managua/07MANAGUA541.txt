SUBJECT: CODEL NELSON MEETS WITH FOREIGN MINISTER SANTOS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary:  In Senator Nelson's meeting with Nicaraguan 
Foreign Minister Samuel Santos, he impressed upon Santos his 
desire to establish sincere and positive relations with the 
new Ortega government and the Nicaraguan people.  The Senator 
commented that Venezuelan President Chavez' lack of sincerity 
is troublesome as was the Iranian President's exploitation of 
his visit to Nicaragua to lash out against the United States. 
 Santos was favorable towards CAFTA, noting the 30% increase 
in Nicaraguan exports to the United States since CAFTA 
implementation, although he noted that the "asymmetries" 
between the two countries makes it difficult for Nicaragua to 
compete against the more sophisticated U.S. economy.  He also 
opined that as Nicaragua's economy improves, fewer 
Nicaraguans will attempt to immigrate illegally to the United 
States and other countries.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Foreign Minister Santos and his wife Annelli 
graciously hosted CODEL Nelson for afternoon coffee at their 
residence and coffee plantation on February 18.   Senator 
Nelson impressed upon the foreign minister his desire to 
establish sincere and positive relations with the new Ortega 
government and the Nicaraguan people.  Mentioning that he had 
met earlier in the day with Costa Rican astronaut/scientist 
Franklin Chang Diaz, the Senator cited this kind of bilateral 
cooperation as an example of the positive relations that the 
United States and a partner country have fostered.  He 
explained Chang's involvement in the development of a new 
plasma rocket, a scientific advancement that will cut travel 
to Mars to a mere 29 days.  His first time in Nicaragua, 
Senator Nelson recounted that during his six-day orbit around 
the Earth aboard the Columbia spaceship, he had observed the 
eruption of Nicaragua's Cerro Negro volcano, which had peaked 
his curiosity and his hopes to visit the country some day. 
 
¶3.  (C) Senator Nelson, who remarked that he has publicly and 
privately lauded Secretary Rice for her interest in improving 
U.S. relations with Latin America, explained that his tour of 
the region is intended to bolster our engagement with the 
region, including with leaders who do not see eye to eye with 
U.S. foreign policy.  He related how in his two-hour meeting 
with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez a few years ago, a very 
charismatic Chavez had been friendly, but not completely 
forthcoming.  For example, in the meeting Chavez insisted 
that Venezuelan was not harboring FARC leaders.  Nonetheless, 
two days later, a FARC leader had been found in Caracas, 
reportedly with the knowledge of the Venezuelan government. 
Chavez' lack of sincerity was problematic.  The recent visit 
of Iranian President Ahmadinejad to Nicaragua was also of 
concern, specifically Ahmadinejad's exploitation of Nicaragua 
to lash out against the United States. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Wincing, Santos appeared to absorb the Senator's 
messages and reassured the Senator that Ortega  seeks 
positive relations with the U.S. government.  He added that 
his government's engagement with the U.S. Embassy, State 
Department officials like Assistant Secretary Shannon, and 
with the NSC has been very cordial and productive thus far. 
The Foreign Minister listed education, including eradicating 
illiteracy, health, and infrastructure as especially 
challenging areas where Nicaragua desires partnership with 
other countries, including the United States and the EU -- 
estimating that 70%-80% of Nicaraguans are functionally 
illiterate. 
 
¶5.  (C)  Santos, who admitted that he is ashamed that 
Nicaragua relies so heavily on foreign assistance, asserted 
that Nicaragua must eventually wean itself off its dependency 
on foreign aid.  However, as long as the  "asymmetries" 
between Nicaragua and the United States continue, Nicaragua 
will rely on assistance, and Nicaraguans will continue to 
seek better futures in the United States.  Walls will not 
stem the flow of immigrants; reducing disparities will, 
argued Santos. 
 
¶6.  (C) Responding to the Senator's query on the effect of 
CAFTA on Nicaragua thus far, Santos said that overall CAFTA 
has benefited his country, including a 30% increase in 
Nicaraguan exports to the United States since CAFTA's 
implementation in April 2006.  The biggest challenge, 
however, lies with reducing the asymmetries between the two 
countries, specifically helping Nicaragua compete against a 
highly developed trade partner.  (Comment: The asymmetry 
argument is one of President Ortega's favorites and may be 
influenced by President Chavez, who for years  has used this 
concept to criticize the United States and justify his 
opposition to the constraints of the IMF and other 
international financial institutions.) 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Santos acknowledged that in addition to foreign 
assistance, the Ortega government will require the support of 
all Nicaraguans and all political parties to succeed in its 
struggle against poverty.  He likened Nicaragua to an ox cart 
that is presently being stressed by four teams of oxen, each 
pulling in a different direction.  Nicaragua urgently needs a 
common purpose and support by all Nicaraguans to achieve this 
purpose, ventured Santos.
