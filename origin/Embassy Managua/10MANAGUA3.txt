SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: NEW TSA PASSENGER SCREENING PROCEDURES IN PLACE
 
(SBU) Following the attempted terrorist attack on December 25, the GON has been implementing the new TSA passenger security screening procedures and is conducting 100% pat-downs for all passengers on flights flying directly to the United States. On January 4, 2010, IvC!n CortC)s, the Regional Manager for Continental Airlines, told econoff that the implementation of the new TSA passenger security screening guidelines is going smoothly and that security personnel at Sandino International Airport are following INAC (National Institute of Civil Aviation) guidance dated December 28, 2009. CortC)s said that the new measures have increased the time required to board passengers, but that the airlines and security have adapted by screening before the cabin crews announce the beginning of boarding. Post understands that INAC Director General Carlos Salazar has been in direct contact with TSA regarding implementation of the new screening procedures. CortC)s said that they will continue to implement the 100% pat-down of all passengers destined for the United States until INAC directs otherwise.
