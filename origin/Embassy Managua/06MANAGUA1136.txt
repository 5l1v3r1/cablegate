SUBJECT: PRE-LICENSE CHECK FOR WEAPONS IMPORTATION FROM 
NICARAGUAN COMPANY COSERVISA 
 
REF: USDOC 1969 
 
¶1. Econoff performed the requested pre-license check on 
Coservisa, which seeks to import Air Taser kits and 
accompanying products (application D355948).  Nicaraguan 
National Police (NNP) and interagency name checks on the 
proprietor did not reveal any derogatory information.  A 
visit to Coservisa confirmed that it is a legitimate 
multi-service business involved in enterprises including 
consumer goods, electronics and pharmaceuticals.  Coservisa 
also runs an English-language religious school in Managua. 
 
¶2. Coservisa managers stated that their plan is to import a 
small number of Tasers for resale to the NNP.  They said that 
they do not yet have a contract because they want approval to 
import the product before formalizing their agreement with 
the NNP.  The company also lacks a current weapons 
importation license from the NNP, which would be required 
under Nicaraguan law.
