SUBJECT: NUNCIO: CARDINAL OBANDO Y BRAVO WILL EXERT LITTLE 
INFLUENCE ON NICARAGUAN VOTERS 
 
REF: 2005 MANAGUA 2738 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Nuncio Jean Paul Gobel shares our concerns over 
Cardinal Obando y Bravo's apparent support for Sandinista 
(FSLN) presidential candidate Daniel Ortega, but he believes 
Obando y Bravo will hold little sway over Nicaraguan voters. 
Gobel, who on June 20 advised Ambassador he is perplexed over 
Obando y Bravo's public proximity with Ortega, insisted that 
privately Obando y Bravo does not/not support Ortega and is 
more closely aligned with the Liberal Constitutional party 
(PLC) and leader Arnoldo Aleman.  In Gobel's view, Ortega 
clearly maintains some sort of hold over Obando y Bravo. 
(NOTE: Rumors have long suggested that Ortega is blackmailing 
Obando y Bravo with information proving that the Cardinal 
fathered children with his secretary and that he has engaged 
in corrupt practices in his management of the private 
Catholic University (UNICA).  END NOTE.) 
 
¶2.  (C) According to Gobel, at this point the Vatican can do 
little to stem Obando y Bravo's actions.  However, Gobel 
ventured that Obando y Bravo would cross the Vatican's "red 
line" if he unequivocally endorsed Ortega's candidacy. 
Faulting the media for "adding fuel to the fire" by according 
Obando y Bravo's undue attention, Gobel commented that he/the 
Vatican believe that Nicaraguans will respond more to 
Archbishop Leopoldo Brenes' measured messages and the 
Bishops' Conference election statement (possibly to be 
released in August) than to Obando y Bravo's declarations. 
The Bishops' Conference will urge Nicaraguans "to exercise 
their right (to vote) and to use it well," explained Gobel, 
who added that the message will urge voters to vote their 
conscience, examine the candidates' platforms, and study the 
past of each party. 
 
¶3.  (C) On the subject of presidential candidates, Gobel 
asserted that the majority of Nicaraguans still regard the 
FSLN and the PLC as the only viable parties.  He recounted 
how Aleman recently visited him and announced his decision to 
withdraw from politics; not convinced, the Nuncio had laughed 
off the news.  As for Eduardo Montealegre, Gobel acknowledged 
that he appeals to youth, Nicaragua's intellectual class, and 
urbanites who appreciate his forward-leaning agenda. 
However, uneducated Nicaraguans and rural voters are less 
likely to grasp Montealegre's message.  To succeed, 
Montealegre must endeavor to reach these groups, especially 
in anti-Sandinista areas, suggested Gobel. 
 
¶4.  (C) Gobel sought clarification regarding the recent 
reported detentions of Nicaraguan bishops Jorge Solorzano and 
Abelardo Matta upon their entry into the United States. 
Ambassador explained that, to our knowledge, nothing out of 
the ordinary had occurred, that Solorzano was fingerprinted, 
as are many other foreign visitors.  He added that the 
Embassy is still awaiting clarification on Matta's case. 
(NOTE: We found out subsequently that Matta was delayed for 
20 minutes during his last entry due to a fingerprinting 
anomaly.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶5.  (C) COMMENT:  We believe Obando y Bravo is close to 
crossing the Vatican's "red line."  We also expect Gobel will 
report our concerns to the Vatican and he may draw on our 
message to press the church to consider taking measures 
against Obando y Bravo if he goes further in his public 
support of Ortega.   END COMMENT.
