Classified By: Ambassador Robert J. Callahan, Reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (U) In a March 4 speech at a Sandinista National 
Liberation Front (FSLN) rally following the presentation of 
credentials by ambassadors from Brazil and Finland, 
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega called for the creation of 
an Organization of Latin American and Caribbean States to 
counter the negative and "imperialistic" influence on the 
U.S. in the region.  Ortega said the new organization should 
specifically exclude the U.S. and Canada.  Such an 
organization, he stated, would be more representative of the 
region than the OAS, would unite Latin Americans, and would 
not "subordinate" itself to the interests of the U.S., which 
is a "troublemaker" in the OAS. Only in this new organization 
could Latin American work together as a block to confront the 
United States and the capitalist system.  Ortega pledged to 
promote the new organization at the April Summit of the 
Americas. 
 
¶2. (C) Ortega also announced that he will demand that the OAS 
reinstate Cuba as a full member and end all countries' 
sanctions against the island at the upcoming Summit of the 
Americas.  "We are suffering from the sin of omission" by 
falling under the influence of the U.S. in denying a seat to 
Cuba, he stated.  (Note: Ortega recently has sought to expand 
already strong ties with Cuba, including expansion of health 
and literacy programs with Cuba, as well as cooperation with 
Cuba's Ministry of the Interior (MININT).  End Note.) 
 
¶3. (C) The Foreign Ministry (MINREX) has refused our requests 
to discuss Ortega's new initiative and the GoN's plans for 
the Summit.  MINREX America's Director Rene Morales told 
PolCouns that "no one at the Ministry" would be available in 
the foreseeable future to discuss Ortega's proposal or their 
Summit agenda.  Javier Melendez, Executive Director of the 
Institute for Strategic Studies and Public Policy (IEEPP), 
noted that Ortega has made a similar proposal in the past and 
would be unlikely to pursue this agenda alone.  He suggested 
that Ortega could be expected to make public statements in 
support of the anti-U.S. organization at the Summit in 
conjunction with other ALBA members, notably Venezuela and 
Bolivia. 
 
¶4. (C) Comment.  Ortega's proposal for an anti-U.S. Latin 
American organization is not new or surprising.  FSLN 
leaders, including Ortega himself, have made clear their 
disdain for the OAS and their view that the organization 
represents an unwelcome vehicle for criticism and oversight 
of its anti-democratic trends, especially with regard to 
elections.  Following international criticism of the 
municipal elections fraud, Ortega called the OAS "the pawn of 
the Empire" and claimed it was involved in a systematic 
campaign against his government.  His apparent willingness to 
raise trouble over this proposal at the Summit, however, even 
as his government attempts to persuade international donors, 
including the U.S., to resume suspended aid, is striking.  It 
could suggest that Ortega may have determined that he is more 
likely to get the financial and technical support he needs 
from ALBA partners and that he is increasingly willing to do 
what is necessary, including causing trouble at the Summit, 
to secure that aid.  Likewise, he may also be trying to 
assert ideological leadership within the ALBA group even as 
his financial dependency on Chavez grows.
