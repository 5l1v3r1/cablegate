Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary:  With an entourage of PLC party hacks and 
media in toe, former president Arnoldo Aleman recently paid 
an impromptu (although some ALN members appear to have 
expected it) visit on rival ALN party headquarters.  Eduardo 
Montealegre was in the midst of chairing his party's weekly 
board of directors meeting, so Aleman was invited to meet 
with other ALN leaders.  According to ALN National Assembly 
caucus leader Maria Eugenia Sequeira, Aleman flatly rejected 
her party's proposals to set a common legislative agenda and 
present a joint list of qualified candidates for judiciary 
appointments.  She believes that Aleman "generously" offered 
to postpone the PLC's internal elections because he has lost 
much of his following.  ALN planning coordinator Kitty 
Monterrey confirmed that Aleman declined Montealegre's offer 
to meet privately -- removed from the gaggle of reporters. 
Aleman's motive for the visit was clearly to deflect 
attention from his failing internal election effort, and to 
create a media circus to convince the public that he is the 
leader of the opposition and that Montealegre had rebuffed 
the "humble" PLC leader's efforts for Liberal unity.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) On March 5, with an entourage of Liberal 
Constitutional Party (PLC) hacks and media in toe, former 
president/convicted embezzler Arnoldo Aleman paid an 
impromptu, likely pre-orchestrated, visit on rival Nicaraguan 
Liberal Alliance (ALN) headquarters.  According to ALN 
planning coordinator Kitty Monterrey, who received the PLC 
leader at the door, Aleman requested to meet with ALN 
leader/2006 presidential candidate Eduardo Montealegre to 
discuss Liberal unity.  Montealegre was in the midst of 
chairing his party's weekly board of directors meeting, so 
Aleman was invited to meet with other ALN leaders, including 
Assembly Deputies Maria Eugenia Sequeira, Yamileth Bonilla, 
and Eliseo Nunez, Sr.; Parlacen Deputy Eliseo Nunez, Jr.; 
and, legal adviser Mauricio Montealegre. 
 
Aleman Rejects Common Legislative Agenda

¶3.  (C) Sequeira, who presides over the ALN National Assembly 
caucus, recounted to PolCouns that Aleman responded to the 
ALN proposal that the two estranged Liberal parties establish 
a common legislative agenda to contain President Ortega, with 
an unequivocal "no."  Similarly, when the ALN leaders 
recommended forming a joint working group to present a list 
of qualified candidates to replace a number of judges whose 
terms have expired, Aleman's response was a resounding 
negative.  Aleman was magnanimous on only one item -- his 
offer to postpone the PLC's internal elections to allow more 
time for all Liberals to join what he touts as his Liberal 
unification initiative. 
 
Is Pact-Bound Aleman Losing His Followers?

¶4.  (C) For Sequeira, Aleman's "generous offer" was nothing 
more than a ruse to conceal his desperation because nobody is 
beating down the door to participate in the PLC elections. 
She noted that Aleman's unwillingness to discuss serious 
issues evidences his unwillingness to support any action that 
could incur the wrath of political pact mate Daniel Ortega. 
Aleman's primary objective was to orchestrate a media circus 
to feature him as the "humble" political leader who only 
seeks to unify Nicaragua's Liberals, opined Sequeira. 
Monterrey supported Sequeira's assessment, reporting that 
when Aleman was invited to meet privately with Montealegre, 
without the cameras rolling, he declined. 
 
ALN Suspects Internal Complicity, Tries to Turn Incident to Its Advantage

¶5. (C) Monterrey shared her suspicions that Eliseo Nunez, Sr., and possibly Yamileth Bonilla and Eliseo Nunez, Jr., may have been "complicit" in Aleman's surprise visit. Montealegre also confirmed to DCM that he suspected Bonilla had arranged the foray. (Note: Camera footage depicts a seemingly expectant Nunez, Sr. warmly welcoming Aleman "home" -- "bienvendio a casa".) Monterrey acknowledged that media reports on Aleman's visit could lead the public to misconstrue that Montealegre had arrogantly rejected Aleman's peace making efforts. She mentioned that ALN leaders will use talk shows and press interviews to dispel this notion and assess how to make the best use of the incident. The fact that Aleman sought Montealegre on ALN turf could be used to convince rural Liberals that Montealegre is truly the leader of the opposition, she ventured.
 
¶6. (C) On March 6, PLC lawmaker Jose Pallais opined to PolCouns that Aleman's impromptu visit to the ALN was in part a tactic to demonstrate to the public that Aleman is promoting, not blocking, Liberal unity, and in part a reaction to growing internal criticism that Aleman must step down from his leadership of the party. He recounted that in a PLC meeting prior to Aleman's sudden visit to ALN headquarters, several party militants openly accused Aleman of being the primary obstacle to Liberal unity. Reportedly, Aleman countered that he would prove them wrong, stormed out of the meeting and invited the ever expectant media to accompany him to the ALN. According to Pallais, PLC lawmaker Enrique Quinonez called ALN deputy Bonilla to inform her of the visit.
 
Comment 
- - - - 
 
¶7.  (C) We hear from both ALN and PLC contacts that the bulk 
of Liberals seek a united opposition and lay much of the 
blame for Ortega's victory on the failure of their leaders to 
unite before the November 2006 election and Aleman's pact 
with their Sandinista arch-enemy.  Aleman's failure to 
attract participation in his party's internal annual 
elections likely reflects this common sentiment and the 
belief among some Liberal activists that Aleman will 
manipulate the outcome (reftel).  We doubt that Aleman's 
visit was as spontaneous as he tried to make it appear. 
Timing the visit to coincide with Montealegre's presence at 
his party headquarters suggests that the visit was precooked. 
 
¶8.  (C) We suspect that Aleman's true motive for the visit 
was to create a media circus to dupe the public into 
believing that he, not Montealegre, is the leader of the 
opposition and that Montealegre had rebuffed the humble PLC 
leader's efforts for Liberal unity.  Much of the media 
coverage of Aleman's "blitzkrieg" on the ALN has been vague, 
leaving it to the public to decide whether Montealegre 
rejected Aleman -- PLC deputy Enrique Quinonez' widely 
publicized version of the events -- or whether Montealegre 
called the PLC leader's bluff.
