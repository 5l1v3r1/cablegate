INITIATIVE PROPOSAL FOR OAS/CICTE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 161166 
 
(U) On December 11, Econoff delivered reftel demarche on the 
U.S. cash couriers initiative to Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA) Deputy Director for North American Affairs Rene 
Morales, MFA Legal Advisor Aracely Rodriguez, and 
Superintendency Of Banks Anti-Money Laundering Director 
Heynar Martinez.  Morales and Rodriguez replied that while 
they felt Nicaragua would be in a position to support such an 
initiative, they would have to send the information to Vice 
Minister Manuel Coronel Kautz for his final decision.  VM 
Coronel serves as Nicaragua's National Point of Contact for 
OAS/CICTE.  Martinez welcomed the initiative as an important 
one for the hemisphere.  He stated that while Nicaragua lacks 
a Financial Intelligence Unit, the new Penal Code does 
address the crime of terrorism financing and defines money 
laundering in terms that meet international standards. 
Therefore, he felt there exists the necessary political will 
in Nicaragua to take on this issue.  Supporting the 
initiative should be in line with existing national policy.
