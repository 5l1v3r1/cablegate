On July 26, POLOFF met with Orlando Gomez, Director General 
of the Americas Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MINREX), to deliver points, as directed, on the adoption and 
ratification of the UN's International Convention for the 
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.  Gomez agreed that 
the issue of preventing nuclear tourism was of mutual
