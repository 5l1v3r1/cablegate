SUBJECT: VICAR SUGGESTS TO DAS MADISON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH 
FAVORS NICARAGUA,S DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C)  In Managua Vicar Carlos Aviles' April 24 meeting 
with DAS Madison, USAID DAA Mike Magan, and Ambassador, he 
affirmed that the Catholic Church will not pronounce in favor 
of a particular candidate.  However, the Church does support 
democracy and favors candidates who make realistic promises, 
not messianic politicians who offer false hopes.  He 
indicated that the "Marxists/Sandinistas have a captive vote" 
of about 30%, while Nicaragua's democratic vote is divided. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Aviles reiterated the Church's desire to 
participate in the election observation process through 
CARITAS.  Madison and Magan assured Aviles that the USG 
values the  Catholic Church's participation and is arranging 
Church participation through USAID's elections partners. 
Magan suggested that while it is understandable that churches 
cannot endorse a particular candidate, they can convey 
messages that certain candidates more closely represent their 
beliefs, as is customary in the United States.  Aviles 
replied that unlike U.S. politicians, Nicaraguan politicians 
have no platforms, and it is hard to pin them down on issues. 
 However, he said the Church will consider this idea. 
 
¶3.  (U)  The Vicar announced that the Church will offer a 
special elections mass before the November 5 elections to 
call for a peaceful process.  Following the elections, the 
Church will arrange another mass of thanks.  He also reported 
that the Church and two Catholic universities will sponsor a 
lecture series on the elections in August; these activities 
are part of the Church's efforts to encourage people to vote 
and to educate them on the options, he explained. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Aviles acknowledged that Ortega is seeking a 
spiritual pardon from Cardinal Obando.  In the Vicar's view, 
however, true forgiveness requires not only confession, but 
also contrition and corrective action,  which in Ortega's 
case has not occurred. 
 
¶5.  (U) Participants: 
 
Nicaragua: 
Vicar Carlos Aviles 
Padre Raul Zamora (Archbishop Brenes' personal assistant) 
 
U.S.: 
Deputy Assistant Secretary Kirsten Madison 
Ambassador Paul Trivelli 
USAID DAA Mike Magan 
A/DCM Alex Dickie 
Polcouns Victoria Alvarado (notetaker) 
 
¶6.  (C) Comment: As expected, the Vicar did not endorse a 
particular candidate; however, his equating of Sandinistas 
with Marxists and his observation that the Church supports 
democracy, suggest that the Church indeed prefers a 
democratic candidate.  Thus, while we cannot expect an 
outright endorsement of a particular candidate, the Church 
may convey a more subtle message to the Nicaraguan people 
that the Church is uncomfortable with Sandinista candidate 
Daniel Ortega.  End Comment.
