SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. In October 2008, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) resolved four 
Embassy registered property claims, including one under the control 
of the National Police.  The Embassy's database now consists of 617 
unresolved registered property claims belonging to 294 Amcits.  To 
date, the overwhelming majority of resolutions have involved 
compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de 
pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs).  As of October 31, 2008, the GON 
had issued BPIs with a face value of $334,078,811.76 to 
Embassy-registered claimants.  Since taking office in January 2007, 
the Ortega administration has resolved 56 claims, nine during the 
2008-2009 waiver year.

--------------------------------------------- 

¶2. On October 6, 2008, Attorney General Hernan Estrada provided the 
Embassy a copy of the final settlement document or "finiquito" 
signed on August, 25, 2008, by U.S. citizen Roberto Perez-Rios.  Mr. 
Perez-Rios received BPIs worth 134,700 cordobas, approximately 
$6,845.59.  We have updated our database to reflect this settlement. 
 Mr. Perez-Rios' property was under the control of the National 
Police in the city of Masaya.  This is the first Section 527 claim 
that the GON has resolved that was under its control during the 
2008-09 waiver year.
