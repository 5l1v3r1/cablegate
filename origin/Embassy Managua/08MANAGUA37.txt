SUBJECT: INL MANAGUA PD&S PLAN FOR FY 2008 
 
REF: STATE 169520 
 
¶1.  INL Managua submits its fiscal year 2008 PD&S budget plan per 
reftel. 
 
¶2.  INL Managua's PD&S needs will increase due to the costs 
associated with Salary and Benefits for the INL Program 
Assistant who will be reclassified as an INL Program Manager and the 
hire of a new INL Program Assistant who will focus on budget 
management.  Post anticipates increased travel costs as several new 
projects are planned and will require travel by the INL Coordinator, 
INL Program Manager, and INL Program Assistant. Post estimates that 
ICASS costs will rise given an increase in projects and demands on 
FMC and GSO.  The total anticipated PD&S budget for FY 2008 is 
$293,100 including ICASS.

¶4.  Post has requested re-allocation of FY 2005, FY 2006 and FY 2007 
PD&S carryover funds -- $7,806.38 for FY 2005,  $12,672 for FY 2006 
and $4,243 for FY 2007. 
 
¶5.  Post has already received $30,000 in FY 2008 PD&S. 
 
¶6.  Explanation of items by object class. 
 
1100 Salaries (and overtime): Salary amount is based on a 
FSN 12, step 1 position and FSN 09, step 1 position.  The increase 
is due to the reclassification of the current INL Program Assistant, 
an FSN 09, as an INL Program Manager at the FSN 12 level who will be 
given greater program management responsibilities as well as 
supervisory responsibility over a new INL Program Assistant 
Position, at the FSN 09 level.  The new INL Program Assistant will 
have primary responsibility for all budget and administrative 
issues.  Even with a full time INL Program manager and 
administrative assistant, INL anticipates the need for overtime, 
particularly with new projects planned for Demand Reduction (Second 
Step), the creation of a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), and the 
planned reconstruction of Nicaraguan Navy headquarters on the 
Atlantic Coast that was partially destroyed during Hurricane Felix. 
 
1200  Benefits:  Benefit amount is commensurate with grade of FSN 
positions. 
 
2156  Field travel:  This amount is essential to cover travel 
expenses and per diem for monitoring/implementing projects 
throughout the country. Several new projects are planned and will 
require frequent travel to monitor their progress. Travel to the 
Atlantic Coast must be done by air and can be quite expensive.  INL 
is also increasing its request due to increasing gasoline prices. 
 
2163  Conference travel:  This increase is being added for 
conferences, staff training and development (particularly for the 
new INL Coordinator, FSN Program Manager, the new FSN INL Assistant, 
and a FSN Financial Management Center Budget Analyst newly assigned 
to the INL account).  This amount will also cover training and 
conferences on the new financial reporting system that will replace 
the FMARS, training related to the creation of a FIU, and attendance 
at other INL conferences. 
 
2322 Telephones: These amounts will increase due to the newly FSN 
INL Assistant and will cover telephone expenses for both cell phones 
and office phones. 
 
2325 U.S. Postal/Dhl/Othcsv: These fees will increase commensurate 
to the increased number of new projects we will implement. 
 
2329 Telephones: These amounts will increase due to the new FSN hire 
and are to cover telephone expenses, both cell phones and office 
phones. 
 
2521  Motor Vehicle Maintenance and Repair: This cost will be 
incurred to provide maintenance to the proposed INL Managua vehicle 
(see item 3105). 
 
2611  Auto fuels and Lubricants: This cost will be incurred to 
provide fuel for the often long-distance travel that will be 
necessary in the proposed INL Managua vehicle (see item 3105). 
 
2622  Office Supplies: Office Supplies will increase due to the new 
FSN hire and the increased amount of administrative work that have 
been incurred by recent project launches and by the launch of future 
planned projects. 
 
3105   Motor Vehicles: INL Managua will need a dedicated vehicle to 
monitor existing and planned new programs, many of which will be 
located further than 200 kilometers from Managua and thus extremely 
difficult to consistently travel just with Embassy motor pool 
resources. 
 
3156 Computer:  This will be for the one-time purchase of a new 
computer for the new hire of a FSN INL Program Assistant. 
 
2589 ICASS: Post projects that ICASS costs will increase with the 
new hire a FSN INL Program Assistant and the increased burden on FMC 
and GSO with the launch of new projects.
