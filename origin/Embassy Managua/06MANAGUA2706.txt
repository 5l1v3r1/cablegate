SUBJECT:  ALN AND MRS JOINTLY LEVERAGING SELECTION OF NEW 
ASSEMBLY BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Deputies-elect of the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance 
(ALN) and the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) 
legislative caucuses are jointly leveraging the selection of 
the National Assembly's new Board of Directors to be formed 
by January 9, 2007.  ALN Assembly deputy Yamileth Bonilla and 
MRS deputy Monica Baltodano told polcouns on December 14 that 
in their negotiations with the National Liberation Front 
(FSLN), the two caucuses are arguing that their combined 28 
seats represent the second force in the new legislature. 
Rival Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC) holds 25 seats. 
According to Bonilla and Baltodano, their parties will also 
jointly challenge the FSLN to break its longstanding 
political power sharing pact with the PLC caudillo Arnoldo 
Aleman. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Bonilla related that the ALN is angling for either 
the presidency or the first secretary of the Assembly's Board 
of Directors, and is pressing the FSLN to live up to its 
campaign pledge to foster a government of reconciliation, 
tolerance, and unity.  Additionally, the ALN is lobbying to 
chair the Defense and Government committees and to obtain 
other positions in the Municipal, Education, and Health 
committees, said Bonilla. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Regarding the scheduled entry into force of the 
Framework Law (Ley Marco) -- which erodes the power of the 
executive branch and reinforces the FSLN-PLC pact's control 
over a number of regulatory entities -- Bonilla reported that 
the FSLN is privately pleased with ALN president Eduardo 
Montealegre's proposal to extend the implementation of the 
Ley Marco for another year.  She explained that Montealegre's 
initiative has "scored points" with the FSLN. 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment:  Former MRS presidential candidate Herty 
Lewites, who died suddenly in early July and was replaced by 
Edmundo Jarquin, had reached an understanding with 
Montealegre that the two parties would support one another 
and promote a legislative agenda to benefit the Nicaraguan 
people.  Jarquin continued with this commitment, and incoming 
MRS and ALN lawmakers now appear to be acting on it.  The 
degree to which the MRS and ALN can join forces to effect 
constructive change in the new legislature and reduce the 
power of the FSLN-PLC pact will partly determine whether 
Nicaragua's political culture can evolve from its current 
state of mafia politics and patronage.  Civil society's role 
will also be determinant.  End Comment.
