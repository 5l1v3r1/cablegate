¶1.  (C) Summary:  The political opposition's latest effort at 
unity, initiated October 21 in response to the Supreme Court's 
(CSJ) ruling to allow Ortega's re-election, appears to have come to 
a halt on October 28 in the National Assembly.  The "united" 
opposition previously had committed to work together to move 
legislation in the Assembly to annul the CSJ's ruling.  However, 
when it came time to place the legislation on the agenda, the 
opposition was divided and the Sandinista National Liberation Front 
(FSLN) was again able to move forward its own agenda.  This latest 
incident underscores the main obstacle toward a true united 
opposition - i.e., some parties (and its leaders) continue to care 
more about personal interests and benefits rather than in 
countering Ortega's anti-democratic practices.  End Summary.

An Ephemeral United Opposition 
 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2.  (C) On October 21 the opposition political parties from across 
the ideological spectrum gathered and agreed to work together to 
combat "the consolidation of Ortega's dictatorship" (ref A).  A 
component of this agreement was to cooperate in the National 
Assembly, where the opposition parties, along with the independents 
who joined them, had a two-vote majority.  The opposition's 
legislative strategy was to prevent quorum on October 27 and force 
the Assembly's Executive Committee (EC) to establish a new 
legislative agenda, which would include legislation to repeal the 
CSJ's ruling.  This strategy was agreed to by the heads of each 
opposition bloc in the legislature, as well as the four opposition 
members of the Assembly's EC (two from the Liberal Constitutional 
Party, PLC, and two from the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance, ALN). 
 
 
 
¶3.  (C) On October 27 the opposition parties were successful in 
preventing quorum and forcing the EC to re-convene.  However, this 
was as far as the "united" opposition was able to proceed.  When 
the EC convened on October 28, Deputy Alejandro Ruiz (ALN) 
abstained from voting on the legislation repealing the CSJ ruling. 
This allowed National Assembly President Rene Nunez (FSLN) to vote 
twice, giving the FSLN control of the agenda and rejecting the 
legislation to repeal the CSJ re-election ruling.  Of approximately 
seven items the opposition wanted on the agenda, they succeeded in 
getting only half.  This included legislation to annul the 2008 
municipal elections, an item certain parties of the opposition had 
pushed since last year's fraudulent elections.  With the 
legislation to annul the elections on the agenda, ALN and PLC 
deputies have now stated that they will form quorum the week of 
November 2.  Deputies from the other opposition parties have not 
stated whether or not they will make quorum, but noted that if the 
ALN and PLC cooperate with the FSLN there will be effectively 
nothing to stop the governing party's agenda - and no official 
means to try and repeal the CSJ ruling.

ALN - Facilitator for Corruption

¶4.  (C) Despite promising to his colleagues in the opposition his 
support for legislation to repeal the CSJ sentence, Ruiz defended 
his abstention stating he needed to carefully review the 
legislation.  However, others from the opposition view Ruiz' 
actions as characteristic of the ALN's duplicitous role in 
 
Nicaraguan politics.  The ALN has five deputies in the Assembly, 
who are usually the decisive votes in the legislature.  For the 
most part, all five (or the necessary number) vote with the FSLN on 
key legislation.  Various opposition deputies of the Assembly (as 
well as administrative staff in the legislature) have told us that 
the FSLN pays the ALN deputies for its votes as a bloc or 
individually, as needed.  Additionally, it is widely believed that 
the ALN deputies are often the vehicle by which Ortega and PLC 
leader Arnoldo Aleman operate their power-sharing agreement 
(locally known as the "pacto").  The ALN votes allow Aleman and his 
PLC to deliver the needed legislation to the FSLN, while allowing 
the PLC to publicly present itself as an opposition party.  Since 
the CSJ ruling, it was widely believed that Aleman was either aware 
that the decision would be taken or actually involved in the 
process, and he would therefore not truly attempt to repeal the 
ruling. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (C) This latest vote in the EC regarding the CSJ repeal 
legislation is one of many instances throughout the year that raise 
concern as to the true motives behind the ALN and PLC votes in the 
Assembly and strengthen the popular belief that the ALN's role is 
that of facilitator of the Ortega-Aleman Pacto.  It is widely 
believed that the January 16 vote for the composition of the EC 
(ref C) was the start of this latest iteration of the pacto.  At 
that time, the PLC voted for the new EC to include the two ALN 
members, arguing that this composition would give "democratic" 
forces a majority on the committee.  Since that time, however, the 
FSLN with only two members has dominated the EC and succeeded in 
promoting its own agenda, to the detriment of the opposition's 
agenda.  As reported in ref C, Aleman gave the FSLN control of the 
legislature in exchange for his freedom.  A more recent example 
also points to the ALN as the bridge between the two caudillos.  On 
October 13 the Assembly approved the government's budget reform 
bill.  In public the PLC stated its opposition to the legislation, 
but according to several deputies (including one from the ALN), the 
PLC voted with the FSLN to push the legislation quickly through 
committee and amended it to include funds for traditionally strong 
PLC areas of the country.  In the end, the PLC did not vote for the 
legislation, but the ALN votes allowed the bill to pass - with the 
extra funding for the PLC territories.  For reasons like these, 
politicians in the Vamos con Eduardo (VcE) and MRS parties (and the 
public in general) are weary of the ALN's and PLC's posturing as 
true opposition parties.

¶6.  (C) In a recent poll, over 63% of the population believed the 
opposition needed to unite in order to counter Ortega's 
authoritarian practices and preserve Nicaragua's democracy. 
Unfortunately, the poll also showed that most Nicaraguans (over 
45%) believed personal/partisan interests were too great and would 
prohibit a true united front; this even after the CSJ ruling on 
Ortega's re-election.  Sadly, Nicaraguans know too well their 
political leaders, who have once again demonstrated that their 
personal interests are above anything else.
