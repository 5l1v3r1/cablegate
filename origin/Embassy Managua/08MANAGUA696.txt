SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST: NEW 'NOTICE TO MARINERS' ON CHANGE 
OF CONTROL AFTER ICJ RESOLUTION OF NICARAGUA-HONDURAS 
MARITIME DISPUTE 
 
REF: MANAGUA 185 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  Please see paragraph 10 
for Action. 
 
¶2. (SBU) BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY:  In October 2007, the 
International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague issued a 
decision resolving a long-standing maritime boundary dispute 
between Nicaragua and Honduras.  This decision established a 
new maritime boundary which granted Nicaragua control over a 
portion of ocean that had previously been under the control 
of Honduras.  Following the decision, the Government of 
Nicaragua (GON) ordered the Nicaraguan Navy to expand its 
maritime patrols to include the area previously controlled by 
Honduras and enforce Nicaragua's requirement that fishing 
vessels operating in Nicaraguan waters hold a valid 
Nicaraguan fishing license.  Since October, the Nicaraguan 
Navy has impounded about a dozen vessels, including two that 
are U.S.-owned, for allegedly not being in possession of 
valid Nicaraguan fishing licenses.  The GON has an 
established procedure to reverse the seizures and return the 
vessels to the rightful owners once fines and demurrage are 
paid. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We note that there is another separate maritime 
boundary dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia regarding 
waters surrounding the San Andres archipelago that Nicaragua 
claims as its EEZ.  In December 2007, the ICJ issued an 
interim opinion on this dispute, but did not resolve it 
definitively.  This dispute should not be confused with the 
now-resolved Honduras-Nicaragua issue.  A Notice to Mariners 
for this entire area has been in effect since 1994, revised 
in 1997.  However, the notice does not reflect changes 
resulting from the recent ICJ decisions.  We have 
strengthened our Country Specific Information (CSI) on this 
matter two times in the last 12 months.  END BACKGROUND AND 
SUMMARY. 
 
Nicaraguan/Honduran Maritime Border Dispute Resolved 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶4. (SBU) The ICJ ruling in the case of Nicaragua versus 
Honduras of October 8, 2007 granted the GON control over 
certain maritime areas previously claimed by Honduras north 
of the 15th parallel.  (NOTE.  The court awarded sovereignty 
to Honduras of four island Keys-- Bobel, Savanna, Port Royal 
and South, -- and the southern 12-nautical mile arc around 
them.  For the actual decision see 
http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/120/14075 .pdf. END NOTE.) 
 Immediately following the ICJ ruling, the GON ordered the 
Nicaraguan Navy to expand its patrols to include the 
newly-awarded maritime space.  Since October, the Nicaraguan 
Navy has seized and impounded several fishing vessels due to 
fishing license problems.  Although some owners have asserted 
that their vessels were "stolen," the GON has not asserted 
that it will restrict exclusive rights to fish these waters 
to Nicaraguan vessels.  Rather, they are allowing all 
properly-licensed vessels and crews to fish in these waters, 
as before when the space was under Honduran control.  Now, 
however, the licenses must come from Nicaragua, not Honduras. 
 
¶5. (U) The Nicaraguan Navy has seized several vessels 
operating in the area.  Most have been Honduran vessels; 
though two were U.S.-owned (one U.S.-flagged, "Shooting 
Star", and one Honduran-flagged, "Fish Hawk").  According to 
our contacts within the GON and the Nicaraguan Navy, the Navy 
seized both U.S. vessels for not holding valid licenses to 
fish in Nicaraguan waters.  The GON has an established 
process to resolve these types of license violations and has 
assured us that this process applies for both impoundment 
cases involving U.S.-owned ships.  The GON has informed us 
that the resolution process requires that owners (or owners, 
agents) pay specified fines as well as demurrage charges.  An 
alternative would be to fight the seizure and impoundment in 
local court.  We were contacted directly by the American 
Citizen (AmCit) owner of one of the impounded vessels (and by 
the office of Senator David Vitter on behalf of the same 
Amcit owner).  In response to both the direct contact and the 
Congressional inquiry, we identified the two obvious 
alternatives to resolve the situation and relayed the GON's 
basic information about its process.  We also provided the 
AmCit with the Consular Attorneys List, some of whom have 
maritime law experience. 
 
Colombia a Separate Issue 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶6. (U) The Honduras/Nicaragua ICJ ruling is separate from 
another dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia south of the 
15th parallel and east of the 82nd meridian, regarding the 
waters surrounding the San Andres Archipelago that Nicaragua 
claims as within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).  NOTE: 
Decision can be found at 
http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/124/14305 .pdf.  END NOTE. 
 On December 13, 2007 the ICJ issued a partial decision in 
this dispute.  The Court ruled that the islands themselves 
were under Colombian sovereignty.  The Court also determined 
that it held competent jurisdiction to rule on the maritime 
delimitation of control over the surrounding waters; however, 
it chose to defer a final determination until after the 
submission of additional pleadings set for November 2008.  In 
issuing its interim decision, the Court also urged both 
parties try to resolve the issue on their own.  To our 
knowledge, no bilateral discussions on this topic have yet 
taken place. 
 
¶7. (U) It is important to note that the area awarded to 
Nicaragua in the Nicaraguan/Honduras case does not overlap 
with the waters in dispute in the Nicaragua/Colombia case. 
The two U.S.-owned ships recently impounded by the Nicaraguan 
Navy were seized within the newly-awarded Nicaraguan waters 
just north of the 15th parallel and east of the 82nd 
meridian, which also constitute the working boundaries of the 
disputed Nicaragua/Colombia boundary.  In its decision on the 
Nicaragua-Honduras case the ICJ stated, "The Court . . . 
observes that any delimitation between Honduras and Nicaragua 
extending east beyond the 82nd meridian and north of the 15th 
parallel (as the bisector adopted by the Court would do) 
would not actually prejudice Colombia's rights because 
Colombia's rights under this Treaty do not extend north of 
the 15th parallel."  Therefore, according to the ICJ ruling 
in the Honduras-Nicaragua case, Colombia has no claim north 
of the 15th parallel, which is the area newly-awarded to 
Nicaragua.  Our GON sources inform us, and we have confirmed, 
that the Nicaraguan Navy seizures have all taken place well 
within this new maritime space.  Colombia has no overlapping 
or competing claim in this area, and the two disputes should 
not be confused or conflated, as far as these two impoundment 
are concerned. 
 
Revised Notice to Mariners Needed 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶8. (U) Since 1994, the Department has had an active Special 
Warning, published in the National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency's weekly U.S. Notice to Mariners, warning that 
"Nicaragua has boundary disputes with its neighbors . . ." 
and that "(m)ariners operating small vessels such as yachts 
and fishing boats . . . should exercise caution."  This 
Special Warning was revised in October 1997, and therefore 
makes no mention of the two recent ICJ opinions or 
Nicaragua's newly recognized maritime sovereignty. 
 
¶9. (U) Given these recent developments, we have revised our 
CSI two times within the last 12 months and strengthened the 
warning language each time.  The current text -- contained in 
para 12 below -- we submitted to the Department on May 21. 
 
ACTION REQUEST 
- - - - - - - 
 
¶10. (U) ACTION REQUEST:  Post requests that the Department 
consider issuing a new Special Warning published in the U.S. 
Notice to Mariners specific to these separate ICJ decisions 
regarding separate and new maritime delimitation in the 
Caribbean.  We have provided suggested language in paragraph 
11 below. 
 
¶11. (U) BEGIN SUGGESTED TEXT FOR U.S. Notice to Mariners 
Nicaragua Special Warning: 
 
SPECIAL WARNING NO. #. 
NICARAGUA. 
 
-1. Mariners operating small vessels such as yachts and 
fishing boats should note that Nicaragua has boundary 
disputes with its neighbors in both its Caribbean and Pacific 
waters, and should exercise caution. 
 
-2. The Caribbean waters lying generally south of the 15th 
parallel and east of the 82nd up to the 79th meridians are 
subject to a current dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. 
 
-3. The International Court of Justice has delimited a new 
maritime boundary line awarding maritime sovereignty to the 
Government of Nicaragua in maritime areas previously claimed 
by Honduras above the 15th parallel.  The Nicaraguan Navy is 
patrolling this maritime space, enforcing the requirement 
that fishing vessels hold a valid Nicaraguan fishing license, 
and has seized vessels not in compliance. 
 
-4. There have been cases where Nicaraguan authorities have 
seized foreign-flagged fishing and other vessels off the 
Nicaraguan coast.  The government of Nicaragua imposes heavy 
fines on parties caught fishing illegally within waters of 
Nicaragua's jurisdiction. 
 
-5. While in all cases passengers and crew have been released 
within a period of several weeks, in some cases the ships 
have been searched, personal gear and navigational equipment 
has disappeared, and Nicaraguan authorities have held seized 
vessels for excessive periods.  Prompt U.S. Embassy consular 
access to detained U.S. citizens on Nicaragua's Caribbean 
coast may not be possible because of delays in notification 
due to the relative isolation of the region. 
 
-6. There have been reported incidents of piracy in Caribbean 
and Pacific waters off the coast of Nicaragua, but the 
Nicaraguan Navy has increased its patrols and no recent 
incidents have been reported. 
 
-7. Cancel Special Warning No. 95. 
 
END SUGGESTED TEXT. 
 
¶12. (U) BEGIN TEXT OF Nicaragua Country Specific Information 
(CSI): 
 
(Within the Safety and Security Section.)  Nautical travelers 
should be aware that there is an ongoing boundary dispute 
with Colombia over the San Andres Island archipelago and the 
surrounding waters, specifically the area east of the 82nd 
and up to the 79th meridian.  Furthermore, the Government of 
Nicaragua has also begun to exercise sovereignty over 
territorial waters that were formerly controlled by Honduras 
but recently awarded to Nicaragua by the International Court 
of Justice.  Two U.S.-flag fishing vessels were recently 
impounded by Nicaraguan authorities for allegedly fishing 
without a Nicaraguan permit in these zones. 
 
END TEXT. 
 
Comment 
- - - - 
 
¶13. (SBU) We expect that this problem may continue for 
several months, if not years, as commercial fishers and 
mariners learn that Nicaragua is exercising its control over 
the formerly Honduran-controlled waters north of the 15th 
parallel, and until the dispute with Colombia over waters 
south of parallel 15 and east of meridian 82 is resolved.  We 
responded to inquires about the impounded U.S.-owned vessels 
by providing information about the established GON process to 
resolve these cases.  We believe that the GON will facilitate 
a resolution once it has been contacted by the owners or 
their agents.  We will continue to monitor the progress of 
AmCit efforts to resolve these two seizures, and are prepared 
to step in and assist should the GON deviate from or delay 
the resolution process as it described to us.
