SUBJECT: RESPONSE T O ECLAC DEMARCHE: NICARAGUA WILL SUPPORT USG POSITION
 
REF: STATE 120607 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Barbara C. Moore, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Ambassador delivered demarche contained reftel to Nicaraguan Minister of Health Jose Antonio Alvarado. After carefully reviewing the materials, Alvarado subsequently informed the Ambassador that he completely agreed with the US position. He noted that though he is not likely to attend the San Juan meeting, he would make sure that the Nicaraguan delegation supported the US approach in Puerto Rico.
 
¶2. (C) USAID Director then met with Secretary of the Presidency (SECEP) Mario De Franco and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Mauricio Gomez to follow up on Ambassador's earlier demarche and reiterate points contained reftel. Key points made to De Franco and Gomez were: (1) the proposed language points to an unqualified re-affirmation of the ICPD Cairo 1994 Program of Action, and the US, Nicaragua and many other LAC countries have, in fact, filed reservations with this language; (2) support for "adolescent reproductive health services" must be linked to parental rights and responsibilities and language about abstinence before marriage should be the preferred method/message for adolescents; (3) the proposal includes code language which could be interpreted as support for abortion rights; and (4) in the discussion of HIV/AIDS there is no recognition of the validity of an A-B-C approach.
 
¶3. (C) USAID Director noted that since it appears that Luis Angel Hernandez of SECEP would attend the San Juan meeting, the USG wanted to ensure that Hernandez had instructions regarding Nicaragua's position as Minister Alvarado had promised the Ambassador. (Note: Hernandez attended the preparatory Santiago meeting in March where the objectionable proposed language for San Juan was drafted and, despite earlier stated Nicaraguan public positions opposing this language, Hernandez had not expressed this opposition in Santiago. End Note.) De Franco stated that he would ensure that Hernandez would have a copy of the draft declaration that the Ambassador provided the Minister of Health. He reaffirmed that the GON had no issue with the U.S. position and would instruct the Nicaraguan delegation accordingly.
