¶1. (SBU) The following information is provided in response to Ref A 
seeking Embassy Managua's comments on OPIC's plans to provide 
financing to Banco ProCredit Nicaragua via a subordinated loan to 
ProCredit Holdings A.G. ("PCH"). 
 
¶2. (SBU) The microfinance industry is under threat in Nicaragua. 
The "No Pago" (No Payment) movement has forced many microfinance 
institutions (MFIs) to close their offices, especially in northern 
Nicaragua (Refs B, E, F and H).  Weak rule of law and poor internal 
controls in some MFIs have made them susceptible to infighting and 
embezzlement (Refs C and D).  Meanwhile, the GON's aggressive 
expansion into microfinance through the National Rural Fund (CARUNA) 
-- an MFI funded through the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas 
(ALBA) -- has heightened competition in the industry (Ref G). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Action Request: Embassy Managua recommends that OPIC send a team to Nicaragua to better understand these recent developments in the microfinance industry.
 
Banco ProCredit Nicaragua 
------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Embassy Managua is not aware of any derogatory information concerning Banco ProCredit. Banco ProCredit started operations in Nicaragua in 2000 as an MFI named Financiera CONFIA. In 2005 it became a bank, supervised by the Nicaraguan Superintendency of Banks (SIBOIF), and began receiving deposits from the public. As of June 2009, ProCredit Nicaragua's assets, according to the Nicaraguan Superintendent of Banks, are $164 million. In June 2009, Fitch Ratings gave ProCredit Nicaragua a rating of AA-. Due to the current macroeconomic conditions in Nicaragua, it is expected that Banco ProCredit will suffer minor losses. Loans in default have increased, as well as the number of restructured loans. Banco ProCredit has a large number of deposits from state institutions.
