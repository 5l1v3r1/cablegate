SUBJECT: CHAD: DETAINED AMCIT CASE 
 
REF: NDJAMENA 807 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Radio France International (RFI) broadcast 
information on the detained Amcit during the 6:30 a.m. (Chad 
time) Africa news broadcast on October 18.  RFI reported that 
Godbolt had been detained while accompanying members of a 
Chadian association on a trip from N'Djamena to Bardai.  The 
broadcast mentioned that the association was implementing a 
pump project funded by the U.S. Embassy in Chad.  The segment 
included an interview with MDJT leader Choua Dazi who stated 
that Godbolt claimed to be a missionary, but he might in fact 
be working for the Chadian government.  The broadcast also 
included a brief interview with Godbolt himself (Godbolt has 
access to a satellite phone which he has used to speak to his 
wife in N'Djamena). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Charge d'Affaires personally delivered a diplomatic 
note to the Deputy Foreign Minister on October 18 requesting 
Government of Chad assistance and good offices in obtaining 
the immediate release of Godbolt.  Minister Moussa Outman did 
not appear to have been aware of the situation, but 
immediately grasped the importance and promised to look into 
it.  CDA will meet with members of the Tubu community in 
N'djamena on Friday October 19 to discuss the case. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post continues to be in close contact with 
Godbolt's colleagues in N'Djamena.  We have heard from 
colleagues that Godbolt informed his family that he was in 
good health.  In response to a query from Reuters, PAO 
informed them that we were aware of an American detained by 
non-governmental forces in Zoumri, that we do not know the 
motive for the detention, and that we are in touch with the 
Government of Chad and have requested their assistance in 
resolving the situation. 
 
¶4. Minimized considered.
