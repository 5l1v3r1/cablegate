REF: A. SECSTATE 84596

Classified By: CLASSIFICATION DERIVED FROM REFTEL 
 
¶1. (S/NOFORN) Post has reviewed the FY 07 proposed 1206 
activity (reftel A) and declines the following program: 
 
Tactical Communications Interoperability (TCI) (USD 3.144) 
for Chad, Algeria, Mauritania and Nigeria 
 
Reason:  At this time a number of training and equipment 
activities are underway with the Chadian armed forces.  We 
are concerned about overloading the host government's ability 
to effectively manage and utilize an additional program. 
Post would be willing to revisit the possibility of the TCI 
program in FY 2008. 
 
¶2.  (S/NOFORN) Post notes that this proposed FY 07 activity 
is in addition to the following approved 1206 proposals: 
 
- MISI (reftel C) 
- Light Infantry Train and Equip (USD 6 million) 
- Tactical Airlift Capacity Equipment (USD 1.7 million) 
- Partner Nation Intelligence Capability (USD 1.1 million) 
(with Algeria, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, 
Nigeria, Senegal) 
 
¶3.  (S/NOFORN) Post reminds that reftel B requested that we 
be given an opportunity to review the details of the proposed 
training for Partner Nation Intelligence Capability 
prior to scheduling of the training and deployment to Chad.
