SUBJECT: EIGHTH JOINT COMMISSION MEETING: JUMP-STARTING THE 
PROCESS 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary.  The Joint Commission on the Darfur 
Humanitarian Cease-fire met September 8-9, taking advantage 
of a visit by the African Union's Special Envoy for Darfur, 
Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim.  The agenda was devoid of any overtly 
controversial issues and focused on a report by the 
Cease-fire Commission on violations by all parties, which 
appear now to be driven more by personal interests rather 
than to be politically-motivated.  In response, the 
Government and Sudan Liberation Movement blamed each other 
for the violations.  The SLM was upset over the Chairman's 
conclusions, which are non-binding, because they noted GOS 
cooperation while condemning the movements.  The also 
complained that they were not given a copy of the CFC report 
and conclusions in advance.  These deficiencies can be 
rectified when a small secretariat and AU office are 
established in N'Djamena.  The meeting represented a small 
step toward re-establishing an implementation mechanism. 
More regular meetings of the Joint Commission plan to be 
held, with the next one likely in Abuja.  Salim's comments on 
the timing of the next round of peace talks in Abuja are 
reported by septel.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The eighth session of the Joint Commission on the 
Darfur Humanitarian Cease-fire (JC) was held in N'Djamena on 
September 8 and 9.  The meeting marked the resumption of the 
JC, which held its last meeting on February 16.  JC Chairman 
General Mahamat Ali Abdallah presided, assisted by new 
Chadian mediators Baharadine Haroun and Ambassador Mahamat 
Habib Doutoum.  African Union (AU) representation included 
Special Envoy Salim Ahmed Salim, Ambassador Sam Ibok, and 
Boubou Niang.  The Government of Sudan's (GOS) delegation 
consisted of Dr. Al Tidjani Saleh Fadoul, Minister of State 
for Foreign Affairs; General Mahamat Ahmat Mustapha al-Dabi, 
Minister of State at the Presidency; Ambassador Ousman 
Mahamat Ousman, Director of Crisis Management, MFA; General 
Esmat Abdelrahman, Popular Armed Forces; Lt.Col. Akram 
Mahamat Hissein; and Ambassador Abd Alla Al Sheiks, Sudanese 
Ambassador to Chad.  The Sudan Liberation Movement's (SLM) 
representatives were Abdeljabar Dosa, Ali Ahmed Traiyo, 
Abakar Mahamat Aboulbackar, Mohammed Altidjani Attaib, Ousman 
Mokhtar Haroun, Oumar Souleyman Dahya, Adman Mohammed, and 
Mohammed Harin.  The ambassadors and charges of the United 
States, France, Germany, the European Union, UNDP, Libya, 
Egypt, and Nigeria represented the international community. 
The Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) did not attend.

CEASE-FIRE CHAIRMAN'S REPORT 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶3.  (U)  AU Cease-fire Commission (CFC) Chairman MG Festus 
Okonkwo and Ambassador Hassan Ali, the new deputy CFC 
chairman, described the situation in Darfur from February to 
September as an "uneasy calm".  During the report period, the 
CFC investigated 154 violations, of which 39 were committed 
by the GOS, 37 by SLM, 5 by JEM, and 73 by Arabs militias. 
Okonkwo said that the nature of the violations have changed 
from being politically-motivated to driven by individual 
interests.  He cited numerous instances of sporadic fighting, 
burning of villages, looting of livestock and property, 
vehicle theft, ambushes of non-governmental personnel, 
attacks on AU personnel and GOS administrative convoys, and 
kidnapping and other crimes committed against innocent 
civilians.  He noted that there has been an increase in the 
return of internally-displaced persons in areas with an 
increased AU presence.  One thousand persons have reportedly 
returned to Abebe village, south of Nyala. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Okonkwo cited lack of command and control within the 
rebel movements as an underlying factor for cease-fire 
violations.  For example, Okonkwo said that SLM continues to 
collect illegal taxes and tolls from the local populations, 
particularly in Thabit, Labado and Graida.  The GOS may be 
mobilizing troops nearby and the AU wants the SLM to leave 
and allow the AU to occupy the area before a clash happens. 
SLM detained an AU military observer team on May 10 at Um 
Sauna.  SLM ambushes on GOS administrative convoys increased 
in May. JEM/SLM confrontations in May and June increased, 
leading to numerous casualties and the surrender of JEM 
 
 
combatants to the AU to avoid capture by SLM.  Okonkwo 
requested that SLM cease collecting taxes and tolls, stop 
attacks on GOS convoys, and pull out of Labado, Graida, and 
Isma. 
 
¶5.  (U)  GOS and militia violations include an April 7 attack 
by 200 jandjaweed on Khor Abeche, which resulted in 4 deaths 
and 15 missing, and controversial police  activity in the IDP 
camps.  The government also conducted an aerial raid on a 
village.  There were numerous instances of jandjaweed and 
militia activities.  Okonkwo recommended that the GOS provide 
72-hour prior notice when it conducts administrative 
movements to give the movements enough notice. 
 
¶6.  (U)  The report notes the emergence of a new group of 600 
men in the villages of Ambarou, Gadi, Sasa, and Tandubaye. 
The group is lead by Sugur Kirni and is armed with AK-47s, 
landcruisers, and Thurayas.  P/E officer asked Okonkwo if the 
new group was tied to either Dr. Sharif Harir/Adam Shogar or 
Mohammed Saleh.  He said that it is not clear who they are.

RESPONSE OF THE PARTIES 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Each party's response focused on the violations of 
the other without acknowledging responsibility for their own 
or outlining steps they will take to curb them. SLM stated 
that the report indicates that the GOS is moving around in 
rebel areas without enough notice, denied the collection of 
illegal taxes, and expressed concern that the CFC lacks 
mobility, but is reporting on incidents in allegedly 
inaccessible areas.  Dosa reiterated Okonkwo's recommendation 
that the jandjaweed be disarmed.  SLM complained abut a 
recent statement made by the AU Mission in Sudan (AMIS) Baba 
Gana Kingibe.  The GOS complained that rebel movements refuse 
to return to their areas and are intent on occupying Labado. 
El-Danabi accused the rebel movements of not cooperating with 
verification efforts.  Tidjani said the GOS is working with 
the U.N. on the issue of police presence in the IDP camps.

CHAIRMAN'S CONCLUSIONS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶8.  (U)  General Ali concluded by noting that most of the 
reported insecurity is because the positions of the parties 
are not well-defined.  The chairman's conclusions condemned 
the crime, looting, kidnapping, confiscation of vehicles, and 
attacks on AU personnel and humanitarian convoys by members 
of the movements and the armed jandjaweed militias.  The JC 
called for an immediate end to these attacks, the disarmament 
of the jandjaweed militias, and the withdrawal of movement 
forces from Labado, Graida, and Isma which will be occupied 
by AU forces.  The chairman called on the movements to 
cooperate fully with the verification commission on positions 
and the establishment of a separation plan. 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  SLM took issue with the Chairman's conclusions 
because in the Arabic version, the GOS is complemented for 
its cooperation on verification efforts.  The GOS asked that 
the English version be amended.  SLM complained that they 
were being condemned in a public document in which the GOS 
was being praised.  Ambassador and P/E officer urged them to 
speak with General Ali prior to issuing a public statement. 
 
¶10.  (U)  For his part, General Ali said that the CFC report 
will be made available in advance of the meeting so that the 
parties can be better prepared to discuss it.  In addition, 
other bureaucratic issues surrounding the JC, such as delays 
in producing the conclusions, will be resolved with the 
establishment of a small secretariat to expedite the 
production of the documents.

STATUS OF AU DEPLOYMENT 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶11.  (U)  According to the account provided by CFC Chairman 
 
 
MG Okonkwo, the enhancement of the AU presence in Sudan began 
on July 1.  The plan is to raise the number of military 
personnel from 2,341 to 6,171.  Currently, there are 5,471 AU 
personnel on the ground with 661 military observers and 3,957 
protection force members, 37 cease-fire commission members, 
and 816 civilian police.  Rwandan, Nigerian, and Senegalese 
troops have arrived as part of the expanded mission.  By the 
end of October, the AU deployment is expected to be fully 
operational and include: three NigerianQattalions, three 
Rwandan battalions, one South African battalion, a South 
African Engineer Company and reserve group, a Senegalese 
battalion, a Kenyan military police detachment, and a Gambian 
company.  The lack of Jet A-1 fuel is hampering the AU's 
mobility.  Currently, El-Geneina and Tine sectors are 
inaccessible due to rains.  The AU is now providing safe 
passage to non-governmental convoys in Darfur.

COMMENT 
- - - - 
 
¶12.  (SBU)  The re-launching of the JC is a first step in a 
longer process of getting the parties to comply with the 
agreements that they have already signed.  An enhanced AU 
mission on the ground will help the security situation, but 
the parties need to demonstrate restraint, discipline, and a 
stronger commitment to implementation of the cease-fire.  The 
JC is correcting some of its bureaucratic weaknesses, which 
in turn could help instill more confidence in the process. 
This was the first JC meeting for the SLM representatives who 
attended, and some of their concerns were the result of 
inexperience with the body's internal procedures.  We are 
encouraging them to make the JC an effective venue for 
voicing their concerns and demands.  JEM's refusal to 
participate does not appear to be a problem for the AU at 
this point.  The next meeting will likely be held at the 
upcoming peace talks, which gives JEM no excuse for 
non-participation. 
 
13,  (U)  Khartoum and Tripoli Minimize Considered.
