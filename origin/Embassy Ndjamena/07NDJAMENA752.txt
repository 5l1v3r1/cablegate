¶1. (SBU) Summary: UNHCR protection officers in Darfur refugee 
camps in Farchana and Iriba report recent incidents of 
recruitment of under-age combatants for Sudanese rebel 
movements.  Chadian officials assert that they are working to 
prevent recruitment and ensure the civilian character of the 
refugee camps but UNHCR officials believe that some Chadian 
authorities are complicit. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a September 15-21 field visit in eastern 
Chad, PolOffs met with UNHCR protection officer Daniela 
Raiman and UNHCR Representative Emmanuel Uwurukundo at the 
local UNHCR field offices in Iriba and Farshana.  Raiman said 
that it is readily apparent to UNHCR staff that Sudanese 
rebels (mostly JEM) recruit in refugee camps.  The rebels use 
the camps as R and R locations, where their wives (many are 
polygamous) and children live and are cared for.  Raiman said 
that there is pressure for boys (ages unknown) to join rebel 
groups and that this can be difficult to prevent from 
happening since NGO and UN personnel return to their compound 
at dusk and are not in the camps on the weekends.  Raiman 
said further that this is being done with the apparent 
blessing of Chadian authorities.  Raiman cited the fact that 
operatives representing Sudanese rebels who recently entered 
the Kou Kou camp had letters signed by Sous-Prefects 
authorizing them to visit the camps.  It is believed that 
recruitment is done on a commission basis.  UNHCR Chief in 
Iriba Uwurukundo reported that the Minister of Mines and 
Energy (formerly Minister of the Interior), Mahamat Ali 
Nassour had visited Guereda, Iriba and Bahai camps to conduct 
a &fact-finding mission.8  UNHCR staff suspected rather 
that his delegation was involved in recruitment. 
 
¶3. (SBU) UNHCR has on several occasions communicated its 
concern on camp recruitment to the Chadian authorities. 
UNHCR has also been conducting awareness campaigns in the 
camps and has visited camp schools to inform children of the 
dangers.  Additionally, PolOffs raised the subject with the 
Prefect of Kobe who strongly condemned anyone participating 
in such activities.  He mentioned an ongoing investigation in 
Touloum camp, adding that four suspects were &under 
scrutiny8 for participating in such activities.  If the 
refugees were more forthcoming, Chadian officials would 
immediately pick up those suspected of recruitment and hand 
them over to the judicial system, said the Prefect. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  Unless UNHCR and the government of Chad 
move the camps further away from the border, rebels will 
continue to have direct access to a young recruitment pool. 
Given the prevailing martial culture and lack of other 
employment opportunities, it is a very susceptible pool.
