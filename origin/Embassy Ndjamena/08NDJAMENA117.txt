¶1. (SBU) Summary. JEM/Collective Leadership fought on behalf of 
President Deby's government during the February rebel offensive in 
order to prevent Sudan from using Deby's collapse to "finish off" 
the Darfur conflict, JEM/CL Chairman Bahar Idriss Abu Gharda told 
Poloffs on March 25.  Abu Gharda claimed that defections within the 
Chadian opposition have since strengthened Deby's hand.  The URF 
will announce a new leadership structure within one week that will 
install Abu Gharda as president and Adam Bakheit as chief military 
commander and is open to exploring unification with SLA/Unity, which 
stalled because of the latter movement's internal fissures. 
Anticipating that elections in Darfur are unlikely before a 
political settlement is reached with the Sudanese Government, the 
URF plans to coordinate its "elections strategy" with the SPLM.  End 
summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Support for Deby in JEM/CL's Interest 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Admitting that the Justice and Equality Movement 
(JEM)/Collective Leadership rushed to N'djamena in early February to 
defend the Chadian Government, JEM/CL Chairman Bahar Idriss Abu 
Gharda claimed in a March 25 meeting with Poloffs that the movement 
does not receive direct support from President Idriss Deby. 
However, the Sudanese Government is seeking regime change in Chad in 
order to "finish off" the Darfur issue, making it in JEM/CL's 
interest to bolster the Chadian government.  "We didn't do this 
because of Deby," said Abu Gharda.  "We did it for ourselves." 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Chadian opposition lost 70 of their 280 vehicles during 
the offensive, said Abu Gharda, and Sudan since compensated for 
these losses.  Despite Khartoum's support, the primary obstacle to a 
renewed Chadian rebel offensive is political not logistical, 
according to Abu Gharda.  A considerable portion of Timan Erdimi's 
Rally of Forces for Change (RFC) has defected to Deby, as have 
Ouddai elements of Mahamat Nouri's Union des Forces de la Democratie 
et du Developpment (UFDD).  Abu Gharda intimated that Deby inspired 
the defections through pay-offs, which have strengthened his hold on 
power. 
 
------------------------- 
URF Announcement Imminent 
------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) After two months of consultations with field commanders, 
the United Revolutionary Front (URF) is prepared to announce a new, 
consolidated leadership structure within one week, said Abu Gharda. 
Abu Gharda will be the URF President, supported by four deputy 
presidents: Ibrahim Zubeidi for military affairs, Khamis Abdullah 
for financial affairs, Sharif Adam Nasour for political affairs, and 
Adam Ali Shoggar without portfolio.  Adam Bakheit will serve as 
chief military commander, with three deputies: Gibril Abdelkarim, 
Abdallah Banda, and Yassin Yusuf.  The announcement will be made 
from Juba at the behest of the Sudan People's Liberation movement 
(SPLM), which hosted the discussions that brought JEM/CL together 
with elements of SLA/Khamis Abdullah, the National Movement of 
Reform and Development (NMRD), and the United Revolutionary Forces 
Front (URFF).  After the announcement, senior URF figures will 
travel to Europe and, they hope, the U.S.  Abu Gharda said they 
planned to submit a written request to meet with S/E Williamson. 
 
--------------------- 
Union with SLA/Unity? 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Due to a leadership struggle within SLA/Unity, the URF's 
unification discussions with that movement stalled.  Abu Gharda 
indicated, however, that Suleiman Jamous and Sharif Harir have now 
accepted their rival, Abdullah Yehia, as the leader of SLA/Unity, 
taking the posts of humanitarian coordinator and secretary for 
foreign affairs, respectively, for themselves.  Optimistic on an 
ultimate merger with SLA/Unity, Abu Gharda said that the URF plans 
to hold a conference after the upcoming announcement to "dispense" 
with the names of the individual factions that comprise the URF.  At 
that point, unification discussions with SLA/Unity could recommence. 
 (Note: In a meeting to be reported septel, Jamous confirmed Abu 
Gharda's account of a reconciliation within SLA/Unity, but, rather 
than focusing on outreach to the URF, noted SLA/Unity's attempts to 
gain support among SLA/Abdulwahid supporters.  End note.) 
 
---------------------------------- 
Non-committal on Census, Elections 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Though pledging that the URF will announce its position on 
census and elections at the same time that it announces its new 
leadership structure, Abu Gharda admitted that it will be difficult

to obtain the "rights" that Darfurians deserve without altering the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and that Darfur is unlikely to 
participate in elections until a political solution is reached 
between the Sudanese Government and the rebel movements.  "The 
problem of the CPA is there," said Abu Gharda.  Darfurians comprise 
20 percent of Sudan's population, he claimed, and deserved a 
commensurate share of positions in the national government.  Poloff 
explained that the elections are a vehicle for Darfur to secure a 
larger voice in national political life and urged the URF to take 
action to mitigate tension and violence leading up to the census 
(reftel). 
 
¶7. (SBU) In response, Abu Gharda said that the URF will coordinate 
its elections strategy with the SPLM.  Believing that the SPLM's 
opposition to compensation for Darfurians and for a Darfurian vice 
president have changed, Abu Gharda stated that the SPLM's engagement 
on Darfur "is getting better"-particularly after the return of SPLM 
Deputy Secretaries General Yassir Arman and Abdelaziz Hilou to 
Sudan.  His goal is to forge a common position with the SPLM on an 
elections strategy, including on whether elections should go 
forward.
