¶1. ECONOMY 
------------------------------------- 
 
TO CELEBRATE THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OPENING OF THE 
CHAD/CAMEROON OIL PIPELINE, THE CHADIAN GOVERNMENT ORGANIZED A THREE 
DAY  CONFERENCE DUBBED "CHAD INTERNATIONAL OIL, MINING AND 
ENERGY"(CIOME 2008) WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ATTRACTING INVESTORS TO 
NUMEROUS POSSIBILITIES IN THE OIL, MINING AND ENERGY SECTORS. 
 
IN HIS OPENING REMARKS PRESIDENT DEBY SAID THAT "NATURE HAS ENDOWED 
CHAD'S UNDERGROUND WITH MANY VARIETIES OF RESOURCES.  IT IS NOT TOO 
MUCH TO SAY THAT CHAD IS A GEOLOGICAL WONDER.  IT IS OUR DUTY TO PUT 
TO GOOD USE THESE RESOURCES, TO MANAGE THEM PROPERLY AND RIGOROUSLY 
WITH TRANSPARENCY IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO THE HIGH  EXPECTATIONS OF 
OUR POPULATION".  HE ADDED THAT UNFORTUNATELY INSECURITY DRIVEN BY 
FOREIGN POWERS (SUDAN) HAS CAUSED THE GOVERNMENT TO DIVERT SOME OIL 
REVENUE RESOURCES FROM SOCIAL PURPOSES TO NATIONAL DEFENSE. 
 
 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
¶2. INSECURITY IN THE EAST 
-------------------------------------------- 
-- L'OBSERVATEUR (INDEPENDENT NEWSAPER) OF OCT. 08, 2008 REPORTED 
THAT FIGHTING HAS RESUMED IN THE EAST.  IT CHARGED SUDAN WITH 
PROVIDING REBELS WITH AMMUNITION.  IT ADDED THAT NGOS CONFIRMED THAT 
THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THE EAST HAS "NO COMPARISON" TO THE PAST 
INSECURITY IN THE AREA.  ACCORDING TO THE SAME ARTICLE, A 
HIGH-RANKING WORLD BANK OFFICIAL, SPEAKING ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY 
(FROM WASHINGTON), SAID THAT WESTERN DIPLOMATS ARE TALKING ABOUT 
CHAD AFTER THE REIGN OF IDRISS DEBY.  ADDITIONALLY, DEBY REPORTEDLY 
HAD A PHONE CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE WHO ADVISED 
HIM TO LEAVE POWER.  COMMENT: WE REPORT THIS MIXTURE OF FACTS AND 
ALLEGATIONS BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY NEWS THAT MANY PEOPLE RECEIVE. 
OBVIOUSLY IT REFLECTS THE ANTI-REGIME BIAS OF THE PAPER.  END 
COMMENT. 
 
-- SEVERAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING  "MEDECIN SANS 
FRONTIERES" AND THE RED CROSS, HAVE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED WORK IN 
THE EASTERN TOWNS OF GOZ BEIDA, ADE AND DOGDORE. THE U.N. 
HUMANITARIAN OFFICE SAYS THAT AID WORKERS IN EASTERN CHAD HAVE BEEN 
ATTACKED BY BANDITS OVER 120 TIMES THIS YEAR, HAMPERING EFFORTS TO 
BRING FOOD AND OTHER RELIEF TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DISPLACED 
PEOPLE. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶3. POLITICS 
-------------------------------------------- 
--THE CHADIAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OPENED ITS ORDINARY SESSION ON OCT. 
¶06.  THE MAIN ISSUE FOR THE SESSION IS ADOPTION OF THE 2009 BUDGET. 
ALSO, THE ASSEMBLY WILL CONSIDER LAWS, WHICH INCLUDE THE PROTECTION 
OF CONSUMER RIGHTS, THE CREATION OF A YOUTH FUND, AND AUTHORIZATION 
OF ADDITIONAL UNIVERSITY FACULTIES. 
 
-- THE PARTY OF IBNI OUMAR SALEH, THE CHADIAN POLITICAL LEADER WHO 
DISAPPEARED DURING THE CRISIS IN FEBRUARY 2008, ASKED DURING A PRESS 
CONFERENCE THAT THE BODY OF IBNI BE GIVEN TO THE FAMILY FOR A PROPER 
FUNERAL. 
 
------------------------------------- 
¶4. SOCIAL 
------------------------------------- 
N'DJAMENA IS WITHOUT FULL ELECTRICITY FOR 10 DAYS, OCTOBER 04 TO 
OCTOBER 13 WHILE THE PRINCIPAL GENERATOR IS BEING MAINTAINED. 
DURING THAT PERIOD AN OLD GENERATOR WILL PROVIDE LIMITED POWER TO 
SOME AREAS OF THE CITY. 
 
ZINA ALKHALIL WAS NAMED MISS CHAD FOR 2008. SHE WILL REPRESENT CHAD 
IN REGIONAL AND GLOBAL CONTESTS.  THE MERE HOLDING OF SUCH A GALA 
EVENT IN CONSERVATIVE, LARGELY MULIM, NDJAMENA INDICATES THAT A 
VIABLE SUBSET OF CHADIANS IS FULLY ATTUNED TO MODERN GLOBAL CULTURE.
