SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Chad and Sudan have made a peaceful end to their 
proxy war, signing agreements in N'Djamena January 15 to 
formally normalize bilateral relations and to reinforce 
border security arrangements, which they spelled out in a 
joint communique.  Chad and Sudan pledged to end all support 
for armed rebel groups and to eliminate them from their 
respective territories, which means JEM must leave Chad and 
Chad armed rebel groups must leave Sudan. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)   These agreements mark the successful end of eight 
months of quiet bilateral negotiations by Chad FORMIN Faki 
and Sudan chief envoy Dr. Ghazi, which the USG and other 
partners of Chad supported and encouraged as the best path 
toward peace after five years of fighting through armed rebel 
clients.  This bilateral track succeeded, after all other 
tracks -- multilateral and trilateral -- failed, because the 
bilateral track permitted greater frankness and transparency 
between the two nations and because the evolution of events 
in the sub-region dictated a change of course to both 
Presidents, Deby and Bashir, who adjusted their geo-political 
and internal priorities accordingly.  It now remains to be 
seen if and how this welcome development can be made 
translated into further rapid her progress on a durable 
Darfur peace, as USG Special Envoy Gration and AU/UN Chief 
Joint Mediator Bassole seek to accomplish.  END SUMMARY AND 
COMMENT.

bilateral engagements undertaken since October 2009.

of Chad, his government, and the Chadian people for their 
warm and fraternal welcome, which they enjoyed throughout the 
lengths of their several stays in N'Djamena.
