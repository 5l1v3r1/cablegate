¶1. (SBU) Summary: Chad rebels have moved across the border, 
bypassed Abeche and are reported to be holding in the Am Dam 
area southwest of Abeche. There has been no major 
confrontation with the government, other than aerial bombing 
by the government on January 28th.  The government has moved 
to fortify positions around N'Djamena as well as moving out a 
considerable number of troops eastward.  Esso and the UN are 
operating normally and have not changed their security 
posture vis a vis dependents and non-essential personnel but 
continue to review their posture.  The Embassy EAC met 
(reftel) to examine the Embassy security posture. A Town Hall 
for employees and family members reviewed emergency 
preparedness measures.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Chadian rebel cross-border incursion that 
started on Monday appears to have bypassed Abeche and moved 
to the Am Dam/Oum Hadjer area. UN sources counted more than 
200 rebel vehicles in one column.  As of January 30, rumors 
of movement as far as Mongo did not appear to be 
substantiated.  The Chadian army is reported to have pulled 
out of the border town of Goz Beida, presumably in pursuit of 
the columns.  In N'Djamena, tanks and armored cars have been 
stationed at roads leading into the capitol (note: this is 
routine procedure during threats of rebel movements.  End 
note).  The President is expected to attend the AU summit, 
but we do not have confirmation of his movements.  As in 
previous episodes, it is expected that he will head to the 
front to personally command any upcoming battles. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The UN, other international organizations and the 
Exxon-Mobil led oil consortium are currently operating 
normally but are reviewing their security posture.  UN 
flights continue to Abeche, although movement out of Abeche 
by humanitarians has been temporarily stopped.  Businesses 
and government offices in N'Djamena are operating normally, 
although the troop build-up and movement is evident in the 
number of convoys of armed Toyota trucks in the streets. The 
French Embassy has instructed French citizens in Abeche to 
stay within the city. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Although the Government remains silent on the 
situation, on January 29, the Minister of Communication made 
a statement on Chad's government-controlled national radio 
network stressing that Chad cannot have peace while the 
Sudanese Government continues to send "mercenaries" across 
the border. This statement on Chad-Sudanese relations came on 
the heels of a precipitous President Deby departure from the 
January 28 Tripoli conference, where sources have claimed 
that Deby left after sharp criticism from President Kaddafi 
and others concerning the deployment of EUFOR on Chadian soil. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post has accounted for all personnel in the field. 
USAID/OFDA Kirsti Lattu is on standfast at the WFP guest 
house in Abeche.  After first requesting the Defense Attache 
to withdraw the JCET training and MEDCAP exercise in Moussoro 
(north of N'Djamena) for security reasons, senior officials 
at the Minister of Health and Minister of Defense changed 
course and assured the Defense Attache that "there would be 
no rebel activity threatening Moussoro and that the JCET and 
accompanying MEDCAP should be permitted to continue." 
 
Embassy N'Djamena actions: 
------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Embassy N'Djamena continues to be concerned of 
reports of military movements in the east as the political -- 
and therefore the security -- situation in Chad remains 
tenuous. We have responded to the current uncertain security 
situation by: sending an additional warden message; holding a 
Town Hall meeting for Embassy employees and family members; 
convening a Emergency Action Committee; and coordinating 
closely with French, UN, NGOs and ESSO.
