SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  (SBU) JEM Chief Dr. Khalil Ibrahim told SE Gration May 
2-3 that his recently enhanced and expanded movement was the 
"New JEM" whose top priority was peace, not conquest.  Khalil 
claimed to represent over 200 Sudanese tribes, offered proof 
that a number of former commanders of separate rebel 
movements had for the moment joined his cause.  Senior 
SLA/Unity commanders and Fur leaders were part of Khalili's 
40-person delegation -- representing the JEM Executive Board. 
 Khalil claimed that only the "New JEM" had effective 
fighting forces on the ground in Darfur and Kordufan, 
dismissed remaining rebel movements as insignificant 
("internet movements"), and said that the only way to the 
Doha negotiating table was via unity with the JEM.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During May 2-3 discussions with SE Gration, Dr. 
Khalil Ibrahim, Chairman of the Justice and Equality Movement 
(JEM) presented his group as the "New JEM" whose top priority 
was peace.  Ibrahim brought 40 members of JEM's executive 
board to the May 2 meeting with the SE.  He claimed that 22 
different tribes were represented on the Board and that the 
"New JEM" included representation from over 200 Sudanese 
tribes.  See Para 8 for the delegation list of JEM Executive 
Board members who met with the Special Envoy.

JEM WAY OR THE HIGHWAY 
---------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Khalil was adamant that his group should be 
considered the only legitimate Sudan rebel movement, and the 
only group to be allowed to negotiate with the Government of 
Sudan in Doha.  He said that he would welcome any rebels to 
the table so long as they were aligned with JEM.  He decried 
GOS efforts to recognize other rebel groups and invite them 
to Doha, saying that the GOS's goal was to divide the Darfuri 
people.  He expressed concern about efforts by the Government 
of Qatar (GOQ) to welcome all rebel factions to the table. 
Ibrahim termed rebel groups not aligned with the JEM 
"internet movements," claiming that they had no troop 
strength.  JEM was now the only strong, qualified movement on 
the ground, he said.  "We have disarmed all the others," he 
asserted 
 
------------------------- 
EITHER YOU ARE WITH US... 
------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Khalil asked former SLA/Unity commanders to stand 
and testify to their loyalty to the JEM; seven people of the 
40-member delegation did so.  Suleiman Mohamed Jamous, former 
SLA/Unity leader, along with former SLA commanders Mansour 
Arbab Younis and Mohamed Bilail Issa, all spoke passionately 
about their decision to abandon the SLA for the JEM.  Jamous 
noted that he had tried for two years to unify various SLA 
factions; having become convinced that a unified SLA would 
never exist, he opted to join JEM, bringing 70 percent of the 
SLA force with him.  Younis then claimed to have brought the 
rest of the SLA's fighters to join the JEM.  Jamous asserted 
that only those "leaders" living abroad still referred to 
themselves as belonging to the SLA, which had no strength on 
the ground in Sudan.  Younis spoke dismissively of Abdul 
Wahid, whose decision to live in Paris kept him far from the 
suffering of the people in Darfur. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Mohamed Abdalla A/Khaliq portrayed himself as a 
representative of the Fur tribe, stating that Fur leaders had 
taken a collective decision to join JEM.  He said that JEM 
offered an opportunity for the Darfuri people to determine 
their own fate.  He spoke of an upcoming conference for all 
Fur people sponsored by JEM.  Khalil asserted that the "New 
JEM" represented the Fur as well as the Zaghawa.

¶6.  (SBU) Khalil replied to a question about Minni Minnawi's 
SLA faction by stating that this group had been disarmed by 
the JEM.  (NOTE:  Ref A appears to confirm this.  END NOTE.)

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The presentations of the rebel leaders who 
accompanied Khalil to N'Djamena appeared staged.  Still, we 
know Suleiman Jamous to be a man of his word in a climate 
where this characteristic is rare, so it seems to us that 
JEM's uptick in credibility among anti-GOS elements is a 
factor to be dealt with.  Khalil clearly reveled in the 
opportunity to portray himself and his group as the unifying 
rebel force in Darfur -- a powerful, peace-focused New JEM. 
His mercurial negotiating tendencies -- agreeing to a 
position he subsequently disavows, demanding concessions for 
taking a step he initially offered to carry out for free -- 
remain unwelcome reminders of his personal style as leader of 
old JEM.  Khalil spent much of his floor time in the course 
of 16 hours of negotiating with SE Gration over a two-day 
period repeating that the JEM had long since satisfied its 
commitments under the February Goodwill agreement, whereas 
the GOS had failed to fulfill its promises.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶8.  (U) SE Gration cleared this message.
