¶1.  (SBU)  Visiting Chief Joint Mediator Bassole told me late 
Jan 14 that he was deeply involved in the final stages of 
negotiations between the GOC and the GOS for a definitive 
peace deal -- the denouement could be written agreements 
signed as early as this weekend -- and that he was at the 
same time trying to "integrate" the Chad-Sudan rapprochement 
with a GOS-JEM deal that could pave the way for real progress 
on Darfur at Doha. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The CJM said he had been working for several days 
closely with Chad Pres Deby and his FORMIN, with Sudan lead 
negotiator Dr Ghazi, and with JEM's Khalil Ibrahim to 
facilitate implementation of both pieces of his diplomatic 
action plan.  Bassole said he wanted to "informally but 
effectively" expand his role as mediator for Sudan to 
mediator for Chad and Sudan, based on the looming 
rapprochement between the two countries, and on the upcoming 
isolation of JEM. He said that he would leave one of his team 
in Chad, loosely attached to MINURCAT, to give him continued 
contact with Deby and the GOS, and another team member here 
to give him similar continuous contact with JEM. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The CJM praised Deby's role in particular in the 
current negotiations, calling him a "good and trustworthy 
interlocutor."  Bassole said that Deby had assured him that 
the GOC had given the JEM a firm deadline -- an "official 
notification" --  of Jan 21 to leave Chad.  Bassole said he 
wanted to give JEM a "way out of its upcoming isolation" by 
facilitating a GOS-JEM deal.  The CJM said that on the 
GOS-JEM piece he was aiming at a tete-a-tete between Ghazi 
and Khalil to reach at least preliminary agreement on "the 
conditions for a cease fire;" on JEM participation in Sudan 
elections; and on the "Status of Darfur" issue. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  If he were to achieve a "private" JEM-GOS deal -- 
he kept using the English word, "deal" in this regard -- in 
advance of the next Doha sessions, that could set the stage 
for "constructive" JEM participation at Doha by giving JEM 
confidence that it was the GOS's privileged negotiating 
partner, even though it would not be the only Darfur actor at 
the table or tables in Doha. The key "private" agreement 
between JEM and the GOS would be on a cease fire, at least 
"the conditions for a cease fire to be agreed at Doha." 
 
¶5. (SBU)  With an eventual cease fire, concrete progress 
could be made, especially on a UN-run DDR program. Bassole 
stressed he was trying to build GOS-JEM mutual trust by 
facilitating their agreement on "the big issues" so that JEM 
could go to Doha and feel confident that its interests were 
protected even as it participated -- apparently as one of 
many Darfur actors -- in discussion of the "little issues" 
there. 
 
¶6. (U) Minimize considered.
