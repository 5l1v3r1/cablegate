SUBJECT: CHAD GENERAL KILLED IN AMBUSH BY REBELS 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: A leading Chadian general died of his 
wounds after being ambushed by the rebel group Union of 
Forces for Democracy and Development (UFDD).  Government of 
Chad reports of Sudanese bombing in Chad's north eastern 
border region were contradicted by humanitarian groups on the 
ground.  End Summary. 
 
Ambush in Hadjer Meram 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) At approximately 05:30 local time on October 29 in 
the town of Hadjer Meram, three columns of Chadian army 
forces (ANT), led respectively by General Bahar Itno (cousin 
of President Deby), General Moussa Sougui (an Embassy 
contact) and General Allanga Hemchi, fell into an ambush of 
the rebel group Union of Forces for Democracy and Development 
(UFDD). 
 
¶3. (SBU) As with most clashes between Government and rebel 
forces, accurate numbers of casualties were virtually 
impossible to ascertain.  UFDD sources reported 215 Chadian 
army (ANT) and 15 UFDD forces killed, while Chadian Defense 
Minister Bichara Issa Djadallah asserted that 100 rebels and 
only four ANT were killed.  According to UNHCR N'Djamena, 
later on October 29 ANT forces entered Kou Kou-Angarana, 
south of the Goz Beida region in which the fighting occurred, 
 commandeered the ambulance operated by Cooperazione 
Internazionale, the Italian NGO which administers the Goz 
Beida Hospital, and attempted to transport wounded government 
forces to the Goz Beida hospital.  There are reportedly up to 
40 ANT troops in Goz Beida hospital. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Among the ANT forces lost was General Moussa Sougui, 
the third highest-ranking general in the Chadian military. 
UNHCR reported that Sougui was shot in the shoulder during 
Hadjer Meram combat but was not critically wounded.  However, 
he suffered massive blood loss during the subsequent march 
from Hadjer Meram to Goz Beida and died in the hospital 
there. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Humanitarian operations in the Goz Beida region 
continue, although UNHCR notes that most organizations have 
no additional security resources at their disposal were 
continued or intensified conflict to emerge. 
 
Government of Chad protests bombing of border towns 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Earlier in the weekend, the Government of Chad has 
accused Sudan of bombing the northern border towns of Bahai, 
Tine, Kariari and Bamina.  (Kariari was the site of the 
National Redemption Front (NRF)/Government of Sudan clash 
earlier in October.) However, humanitarian groups on the 
ground in Bahai say that they have neither seen nor heard any 
evidence of bombing. 
 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) On December 22,2005, General Sougui sustained 
serious burns when his helicopter was shot down.  He was a 
popular and thoughtful leader, and it is expected that his 
loss will be a serious blow to morale.   UNHCR contacts 
predicted that the GOC would have to contend with significant 
morale loss and desertions within its military ranks in the 
days ahead.  Sougui's funeral October 30 in N'djamena was 
widely attended and the funeral cortege disrupted regular 
traffic for much of the morning.  Eyewitnesses in Bahai 
reported that the Sudanese rebels of the National Redemption 
Front also held a ceremony there to mark his death, another 
indication of the close relationship between the NRF and the 
ANT.
