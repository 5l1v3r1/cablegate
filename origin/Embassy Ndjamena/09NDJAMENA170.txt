REF: A. NDJAMENA 166 
     ¶B. NDJAMENA 165 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) RETURN TO NORMAL:  Life is returning to normal as 
the GOC and others continue to assess the impact of the May 4 
rebel incursions and plan for the future.  MINURCAT has 
resumed all operations in the east. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) DEBY VISITS TROOPS:  President Deby, accompanied by 
acting Minister of Defense Adoum Younousmi, visited Goz Beida 
May 11 to show support for his troops and assess the 
situation.  It was the President's first trip to the east 
since the incursion began, and his second this spring. 
Reports continue to circulate that the GOC is conducting 
"mopping up" operations in the east. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MUSLIM LEADERS CONDEMN ATTACKS:  Following Deby's 
May 9 statement criticizing Khartoum's alleged role in the 
attacks, the High Council of Islamic Affairs issued a similar 
May 11 release blaming Khartoum for the incursion and calling 
Sudan's actions "un-Islamic."  The Council is openly pro-Deby 
and its statement came as no surprise. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) AFTERMATH:  Sources expect damage figures -- 
including for rebels killed and captured -- to rise as 
information increases on the types and quantities of rebel 
equipment captured by the Chadian National Army (ANT). 
Reports are beginning to emerge that rebel child soldiers 
have been captured by the ANT.  Post is following up as well 
as reaching out to human rights organizations regarding 
treatment of captured rebels. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) EMBASSY EAC:  Post convened an EAC today (Ref A), 
deciding to lift the suspension on TDY visits.  All Post 
operations are at normal levels. 
 
¶6.  (U) Minimize considered.
