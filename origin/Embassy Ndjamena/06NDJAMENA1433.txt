Commissioner's visit to IDP camps near Goz Beida, there are 
a number of reports of Janjaweed activity in the vicinity; 
the Chadian military and local self-defense militia appear 
to be reinforcing their elements for a possible defense. 
UNHCR expects that 9,000 new IDPs may be created as a result 
of expected violence.  End Summary.

¶2.  (SBU) In the middle of preparations for the visit of the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees to the refugee camps in 
the Goz Beida area, threats of Janjaweed attacks are causing 
population displacements and the Chadian military and local 
self-defense militia (Toroboro) appear to be reinforcing 
their elements for a possible defense. IDPs from the village 
of Habile have reportedly entered the Goz Amer camp and are 
living with the refugee populations out of security 
concerns.  Violence is on the upswing.  UNHCR reports that 
10 refugees have gone missing in the past few days, and four 
refugees were reportedly killed in local conflicts (the 
reason for death is unclear).  Poloff visited the hospital 
in Goz Beida, and encountered two individuals who claimed to 
be seriously injured by Janjaweed militias after refusing to 
hand over their cattle, and a CNAR local official who was 
shot in the hand by unknown assailants.

¶3.  (SBU) While the Koukou refugee camp was calm on the 
afternoon of December 18, Poloff and UNHCR observed five 
Chadian national army (ANT) vehicles with heavily armed 
soldiers going from Goz Beida to Koukou.  There were reports 
that between 500-1,000 armed individuals on camels (being 
identified as Janjaweed militia) are in the vicinity of 
Koukou.  Janjaweed militia was also seen approximately 100 
meters from the InterSOS clinic in the Goz Amer camp.  ANT 
officials are asserting to the UN that the Janjaweed are 
supported by the Sudanese government in an attempt to 
destabilize the region and pave the way for "pan- 
arabization" of Chad and surrounding countries. 
 
¶4. (SBU) With reports of Janjaweed movements coming closer 
to Goz Beida, UNHCR and NGO staff are bracing for a 
Janjaweed attack on the town, although the motives for such 
an attack are not clear.  The village of Enedif, close by to 
Goz Beida, has been emptied out after reports of Janjaweed 
movement in the area.  ANT elements, as well as local 
Toroboro militias, are reportedly fortifying the area to 
defend it from a potential Janjaweed attack.  While there is 
no apparent presence from the JEM/NRF, there are unconfirmed 
reports the JEM/NRF are integrated into the ANT.

¶5.  (SBU) The UNHCR advance team intends to travel to Koukou 
camp December 19 prepare for UNHCR Guterres' visit.  Should 
the camp be too insecure, UNHCR will take the High 
Commissioner to the Djabal camp.  UNHCR expects that 9,000 
new IDPs may be created as a result of expected violence.

COMMENT

¶6.  (SBU) The Government of Chad (GOC) response to the 
threat of Janjaweed violence in the Goz Beida area 
represents a new wrinkle in the troubled border area. 
Previous Janjaweed predations have met with limited (if any) 
GOC defense. Wall
