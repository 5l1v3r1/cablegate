¶1.  (SBU) AMBASSADOR NIGRO MET WITH MINURCAT SRSG VICTOR ANGELO ON 
AUGUST 7. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) THE KEY POINTS OF OUR DISCUSSION WERE: 
 
-- ANGELO WAS EFFUSIVELY APPRECIATIVE OF THE RECEPTION AND 
COMPREHENSION HE RECEIVED DURING HIS RECENT VISIT TO WASHINGTON, 
PARTICULARLY IN THE DEPARTMENT. 
 
-- ANGELO SAID THAT HE HOPED TALK THAT HE HAD HEARD OF ANOTHER 
SUBSTANTIAL USG CONTRIBUTION TO THE MINURCAT TRUST FUND WOULD COME 
TRUE; AND THAT HE APPRECIATED THE USG OFFER TO INCREASE ITS MILITARY 
ADVISORS FROM TWO TO EIGHT. 
 
-- ANGELO SAID THAT MINURCAT COULD SUPPORT A "VERIFICATION TEAM" TO 
INSPECT AREAS OF EASTERN CHAD BY PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION AND 
SECURITY. 
 
-- ANGELO SAID HE WAS UNAWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF ANY SUBSTANTIAL 
"JEM LOGISTICAL FACILITY" IN EASTERN CHAD; ANGELO THOUGHT THAT IF 
SUCH A FACILITY EXISTED, HIS GUYS WOULD KNOW OF IT AND IT WOULD BE A 
VERY SIMPLE, PERHAPS TEMPORARY AFFAIR.  (COMMENT:  THE SRSG WILL 
ONLY CLAIM THAT WHICH MINURCAT FORCES PERSONALLY WITNESS.  GIVEN 
MINURCAT'S THIN SPREAD, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE FORCES HAVE YET TO 
HAPPEN ACROSS ANY FACILITY, WHETHER OR NOT IT LIES WITHIN MINURCAT'S 
AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY.  END COMMENT.) 
 
-- ANGELO SAID THAT HE DISCOUNTED RECENT SUDANESE GOVERNMENT 
ALLEGATIONS OF SERIOUS INCURSIONS INTO SUDAN BY CHADIAN ARMY UNITS 
NORTH OF EL GENEINA; ADDED THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS A GOOD CHANCE OF 
CHAD MILITARY STRAYING ACROSS THE UNMARKED BORDER; AND OBSERVED THAT 
SUCH INCURSIONS AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR WERE ASYMPTOMATIC OF CHAD 
MILITARY PRACTICE.
