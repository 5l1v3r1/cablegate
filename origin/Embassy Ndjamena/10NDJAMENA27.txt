SUBJECT: EFFECTIVENESS OF UN EFFORTS TO COMBAT SEXUAL EXPLOITATION 
AND ABUSE IN MINURCAT -- CHAD 
 
REF:  STATE 130760 
 
¶1. (U) The following responds to Reftel request for analysis of 
measures to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and 
trafficking in persons (TIP) involving UN peacekeeping personnel in 
Chad. 
 
THE MINURCAT MISSION 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) MINURCAT, the UN Mission in the Central African Republic and 
Chad, was established at the end of 2007, and is thus two years old. 
 However, most of the Substantive Sections of the mission became 
operational in mid-2008, and moved to the east in late 2008.  The 
Mission is currently comprised in Chad of several elements: 
 
(a) a mandated military force of 5225 personnel for Chad and CAR, of 
which 2332 had been deployed to Chad, and 281 to CAR at end-2009; 
(b) a contingent of 185 UN Police (UNPOL) officers, engaged in the 
training and mentoring of the 850-member Chadian Detachement Integre 
de Securite (DIS) police force tasked with policing refugee and IDP 
camps in eastern Chad; and, 
(c) 419 international civilian personnel, 323 local civilian staff 
and 134 United Nations Volunteers supporting the SRSG and conducting 
activities in the Political and Civil Affairs, Human Rights, Gender, 
HIV/AIDS, Justice, Penal Systems, Mine Action, and Humanitarian 
Liaison sectors; and security. 
 
¶3. (U) Total MINURCAT personnel deployed to Chad as of December 2009 
-- military, civilian, international and national -- amounts to 
¶3674.  MINURCAT is not an integrated UN mission under the SRSG; thus 
the large humanitarian response from numerous UN agencies remains 
autonomous from the PKO. 
 
MINURCAT REPORTING 
------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) MINURCAT reports that the essential SEA enforcement actions 
and countermeasures required by UNSCRs 1612, 1674 and 1820 are in 
place to ensure that SEA and TIP violations are not committed by 
MINURCAT's civilian, police and military staff.  In particular, a 
Conduct and Discipline Unit was established in late 2008 to work on 
these issues.  This unit receives complaints, investigates them, and 
makes recommendations as a result of these investigations.  Other 
specific measures taken in MINURCAT include: 
 
-- SEA language in the mission mandate; 
 
-- A POC for SEA allegations to be reported; and 
 
-- Designated off-limit areas for personnel. 
 
¶5. (SBU) MINURCAT reports that during the year ending on 12/31/2009, 
the Conduct and Discipline Unit received three complaints involving 
SEA.  One complaint fell in the sub-category of Transactional Sex 
(including for food, work, and money) and two fell under the 
sub-category of Exploitative relationship.  Administrative action 
was taken in all three cases, in which (a) one case was 
substantiated; (b) one case was not substantiated; and (c) one case 
is still pending. 
 
POST ASSESSMENT 
--------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Post assesses that UN efforts to prevent SEA and TIP 
violations by MINURCAT personnel have been effective thus far.  No 
unaddressed SEA or TIP issues regarding MINURCAT personnel have been 
raised by Chadian authorities, civil society groups, NGOs, UN 
humanitarian agencies, or the Chadian press. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Members of the DIS Chadian Police unit, outside of 
MINURCAT's direct command but under training and mentorship of 
MINURCAT's UNPOL units, committed a number of acts of SEA early in 
the year that strained the organization's relationship with both 
humanitarians and refugees.  Although the DIS is not under MINURCAT 
authority, UNPOL confronted these abuses quickly, and perpetrators 
were removed from the service.  On positive side, reports of such 
incidents have declined in the latter part of 2009 and the DIS has 
provided a new capacity to pursue perpetrators of Gender Based 
Violence among the refugee and internally displaced populations and 
to protect their victims. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Embassy Bangui concurs with Embassy Ndjamena's assessment 
and has no additional information to report. 
 
¶9. (U) Minimize Considered.
