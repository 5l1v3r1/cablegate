¶1. (SBU) International Red Cross Deputy Director Nikolai 
Panke contacted Charge D'Affaires on November 5 to inform her 
that he had spoken with MDJT splinter group leader Choa Dazi 
by phone.  Dazi told him that Amcit Cash Steven Godbold would 
be released in the next couple of days. Dazi called Godbold a 
"guest" (rather than a hostage.)  Panke said that Dazi had 
asked for Red Cross assistance in facilitating the transfer 
and expressed concern about the security of his men. Neither 
the location (nor the country) was specified.  Panke will be 
in touch with Government of Chad (GOC) authorities and with 
Godbold's colleagues in N'Djamena to organize the handover. 
 
¶2. (U) Tripoli minimize considered.
