May 11 
 
Excellence, Mr. Ambassador, 
 
I have the honor to bring to your attention that His 
Excellence, Mr. Idriss Deby Itno, President and Head of State 
of the Republic of Chad, greatly appreciates the demarche of 
the Government of the United States of America as contained 
in Note Verbale number 160 of May 10, 2006 from its Embassy 
in N'djamena concerning settling the conflict in Darfur. 
 
His Excellence, President Idriss Deby Itno is convinced that 
nothing is worth more than peace, and that every effort 
towards this goal is welcome.  He believes further that a 
true peace -- one that is sincere and definitive in this part 
of the continent -- must be pursued with respect to the 
following information and suggestions: 
 
-- Chad was the first to react in favor of restoration of 
peace in Darfur, because security and return of refugees 
depends on this. 
 
-- Since the beginning of the conflict, our country has been 
at the side of the international community to help the 
Sudanese people to find true peace through negotiations.  The 
Tripoli Accord is a good start which should lead us to a 
resolution of this conflict. 
 
-- Chad calls on the international community to redouble its 
efforts and, as needed, put pressure on the belligerents so 
that the Abuja Accord is not in vain. 
 
-- Mini's faction, which has signed the Abuja Accord, should 
be supported and encouraged on the ground. 
 
-- The international community and the United States must put 
pressure on the two parties which have refused to sign this 
agreement in order to bring them to do it, inasmuch as  -- 
for us -- peace in Darfur is also peace in Chad, and 
therefore, stability in the entire region. 
 
-- The presence of a UN force as soon as possible will be a 
good arrangement to support this accord; 
 
-- Chad is very preoccupied by the security of the refugees, 
but does not have the financial, material or human resources 
to provide for their security. 
 
-- Chad calls on the international community to find an 
urgent solution by the end of June to guarantee the security 
of the populations along the border as these communities are 
exposed to the janjaweed massacres. 
 
-- Chad requests the intervention of the international 
community and of the  United States of America to provide 
assistance to the displaced Chadian communities. 
 
-- Chad is ready to act together with the international 
community to prevent the infiltration of Sudanese rebels on 
its territory. 
 
-- Chad is ready to renew neighborly relations and 
cooperation with Sudan, on the condition that Sudan accept 
the following key conditions:  Bring the janjaweed -- the 
authors of these heinous acts - to the International Court of 
Justice, prohibit the recruitment of rebels in the refugee 
camps and renounce its support for Chadian mercenaries.
