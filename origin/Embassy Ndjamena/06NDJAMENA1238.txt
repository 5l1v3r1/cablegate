¶1. (SBU) Charge made points in reftel B to Djinna Moussa 
Outman, Chad Minister Delegue (Deputy Foreign Minister) at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on October 13, 2006.  Outman 
informed Charge that Chad shared the U.S. view that the 
election was an important one but made no other comment on 
the candidates or on Chad's position.  He promised to convey 
the points to the country's highest authorities.  Charge 
requested Outman to contact her over the weekend if any 
decision was taken. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Comment:  The recent visit of Venezuela's Deputy 
Foreign Minister offering Chad assistance with oil management 
may have secured President Deby's consent to support 
Venezuela in the Security Council (SC) election. Post 
believes that the decision on the SC vote will be taken by 
President Deby and strongly suspects that Chad's "undecided" 
should be construed as a "yes" for Venezuela.
