¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY:  On September 24, the Higher Regional Court 
(OLG) in Schleswig found Moroccan national Abdelali Miftah 
guilty of supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq through the recruitment 
and trafficking of three Islamist fighters during the period 
between the beginning of June 2006 and July 6, 2006.  He was 
also found guilty of aiding and abetting the foundation of a 
foreign terrorist organization in Sudan.  The court sentenced 
him to four years in prison.  Miftah was the last accomplice of 
the terrorist cell surrounding Redouane El-Habhab to be 
convicted by this court (Refs. A and B).  Miftah has appealed 
the verdict before the German Federal Supreme Court (BGH).  The 
defense has until year's end to prepare the written reasons for 
its appeal.  Germany currently has no plans to deport Miftah to 
Morocco.  END SUMMARY.

Background and Arrest 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Miftah was born on September 29, 1982 in 
Tetouan/Morocco.  He has six siblings.  His parents live in 
Belgium as Belgian citizens.  He was arrested in Sweden on March 
3, 2007.  Based on a March 26, 2007 European arrest warrant he 
was transferred to an extradition detention facility and 
extradited to Germany on May 15, 2007.  The Schleswig OLG 
established jurisdiction for the case by showing that the 
crimes, in particular those committed by El-Habhab, with whom 
Miftah was cooperating, were committed in Germany in the period 
between the beginning of June 2006 and July 6, 2006.

¶3. (SBU)  Miftah was convicted of supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq by 
recruiting and trafficking three Islamist fighters.  The court 
found him guilty of assisting the foundation of a Sudanese 
terrorist organization because he  pledged financial support and 
acquired additional money.  As opposed to Thaer Alhalah, whom 
the chief judge dubbed the "finance minister" of the cell around 
El-Habhab (Ref. B), Miftah was not singled out for having 
performed a particularly crucial role within the organization. 
The OLG based its decisions on three factors:  (1) credible 
testimony, particularly by Swedish Security Police 
interrogators; (2) Miftah's admitted on-line identity as 
"salimmohammad;" and (3) digital subscriber line (dsl) 
protocols.  Miftah's denial of the charges throughout the 
proceedings contributed to a lengthier penalty.  However, the 
judge considered Miftah's lack of a prior criminal record 
favorably.
