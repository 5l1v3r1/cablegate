¶1. (U) In the early morning hours of January 26, vandals 
attacked the property of two ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems Board 
Members.  Alleged G8 opponents splattered Walter Klausmann's 
house with paint balloons and broke his car's windshield shortly 
before setting Herbert Aly's car on fire.  In a three-page 
letter sent on January 27 to the newspaper Hamburger Morgenpost, 
the group "Revolutionary Antimilitaristic Activists" 
("Revolutiondre antimilitaristische AktivistInnen") claimed 
responsibility for the "militant attacks against armament 
managers" and used the slogan "Assault the NATO-War-Conference 
in Munich - Paralyze the G8 in Heiligendamm." 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a meeting with DCM Koenig on January 26, Hamburg 
Interior Minister Udo Nagel stated that this most recent assault 
is approximately the 20th attack on property in the Hamburg 
region related to the upcoming G8 summit.  Nagel stated that 
there is a strong left-wing militant scene in Hamburg.  He 
estimated that there about 700 individuals who have the 
potential to be violent.  Nagel expects Hamburg to be one of the 
focal points for G8 protesters along with Heiligendamm, Rostock, 
and Berlin.  Nagel also expects many protesters to come to 
Hamburg for the ASEM foreign ministers meeting May 28-29, just 
days before the G8 Summit. 
 
¶3. (U) This message has been coordinated with Embassy Berlin.
