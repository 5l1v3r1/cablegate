SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Ministers of finance from Bolivia, Brazil, 
Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela met in Montevideo on 
April 25 for the fourth Banco del Sur (Bank of the South) 
ministerial meeting.  Argentina did not participate in the 
meeting following the resignation of its Minister of Economy 
one day earlier.  The other ministers developed a proposal 
for the bank's charter, but the draft still requires 
Argentine input, approval of the members' presidents, and 
ratification in their respective congresses.  Minister of 
Finance Danilo Astori privately told us that he did not 
believe the Bank project to be useful and that Uruguay agreed 
to participate only so as not to be isolated.  He considered 
it unlikely for the Bank to be approved, formed and start 
operating any time soon.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------- 
THE CHARTER PROPOSAL SO FAR 
--------------------------- 
¶2. (U) At the April 25 Ministerial, the six participants 
agreed on a proposal for the Banco del Sur charter that 
included an initial capitalization of USD 7 billion.  Brazil, 
Argentina and Venezuela would contribute USD 2 billion each; 
Uruguay and Ecuador USD 400 million each; and Bolivia and 
Paraguay USD 100 million each.  Capital would later be 
augmented to $20 billion, with smaller countries allowed more 
time to complete their contributions.  Ministers also agreed 
that large partners (Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela) would 
have access to credit up to four times their contribution, 
while smaller members could borrow up to eight times their 
contribution. 
 
---------- 
NEXT STEPS 
---------- 
¶3. (SBU) While the Montevideo meeting was a step forward 
towards creating the bank championed by Venezuelan President 
Chavez and former Argentine President Kirchner, several key 
issues still need to be addressed before it is launched. 
Once the Government of Argentina has considered the draft 
charter, member countries will have to determine each 
country's voting power and the composition of the bank's 
Board.  Such negotiations could be protracted since smaller 
partners, like Uruguay, will likely push for equal voting 
power while large ones will seek a vote proportional to 
capital invested.  Once approved, the bank's charter will 
also need to be ratified by the seven member congresses. 
This is likely to be a lengthy process. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
URUGUAY IS NOT IN THE BANK OUT OF CONVICTION 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶4. (C) Minister of Finance Danilo Astori confided in a 
meeting with the DCM on May 2 that the formation of the bank 
would be "a very slow process" and that he liked it that way. 
 Uruguay had to join the bank because it could not remain the 
only country outside, he explained.  Astori predicted that 
the Bank would run into many hurdles as each of the countries 
analyzed the proposed charter and their respective congresses 
considered it.  He did not expect any progress in the near 
term.   The Minister said the new bank would replicate the 
role of other international financial institutions like the 
Inter-American Development Bank and especially the Andean 
Development Corporation (CAF in Spanish).  Uruguay is 
benefiting significantly from its participation in these 
banks. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
BACKGROUND: BANCO DEL SUR'S SLOW CONCEPTION 
------------------------------------------- 
¶5. (SBU) Mercosur countries first discussed the creation of a 
regional development bank in a July 2006 ministerial meeting, 
as a means to deepening regional financial integration.  The 
bank was championed by Venezuela and Argentina which both 
signed a memorandum of understanding in February 2007 to 
create it.  Bolivia signed in March 2007 and Brazil, 
initially cool to the idea, signed in May 2007.  In Uruguay, 
the debate to support Banco del Sur was part of a tough 
arm-wrestling between Minister of Finance Danilo Astori and 
former Minister of Foreign Affairs Reinaldo Gargano, who was 
extremely favorable to Venezuela.  Uruguay, initially elected 
to participate as an observer, but later signed in June 2007. 
 The bank was formally launched --with no charter-- in 
December 2007 by seven South American presidents on the 
margins of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez' 
inauguration.
