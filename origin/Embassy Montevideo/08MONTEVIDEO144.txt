March 17 Consultation of Ministers where it would play a 
neutral and proactive role. 
 
¶3. (C) Barros emphasized that Uruguay was sending a senior 
delegation, comprised of FM Fernandez, Director General of 
the Secretariat Jose Cancela, and Director General for 
Political Affairs Juan Enrique Fischer.  He described the 
delegation as ready to engage and be proactive on the issue.

Plan Colombia as an issue at the March 17 OAS meeting.
