(U) On June 13, Political Counselor delivered ref A demarche 
to the MFA's Director of Multilateral Affairs Gustavo Alvarez 
and to the MFA's Counselor for Human Rights Gabriel Winters. 
Both officials were familiar with issues from previous, 
similar demarches on the subject and aware of the importance 
of the June 20-21 International Conference in Geneva. Winters 
said that the GOU would continue to support the Third 
Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, the admission 
of Magen David Adom (MDA) to the International Red Cross and 
Red Crescent Movement and added that the GOU "had no problem 
with any of the talking points as presented."
