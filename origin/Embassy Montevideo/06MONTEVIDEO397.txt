for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
(C) On April 2, Pol Counselor delivered ref B demarche to MFA 
Deputy Director General for Political Affairs Alvaro 
Gallardo, emphasizing Iran's poor human rights record and its 
refusal to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) and the international community regarding its 
nuclear program.  Gallardo indicated that the Director 
General of Political Affairs, Ambassador Bruno Faraone had 
already instructed Uruguay's UN delegation not to support 
Iran's candidacy for the UN Human Rights Council.  He said 
this decision was likely to be accepted "unless it was 
overturned at the highest level here", an obvious reference 
to Foreign Minister Reinaldo Gargano who is currently 
traveling with President Vazquez in the US.  Gallardo also 
stated that the Iranian Embassy in Montevideo had been 
pressing the MFA's Office of Multilateral Affairs "hard" for 
GOU support, but that its Multilateral Affairs Director 
Gustavo Alvarez had told the Iranians that a decision had not 
yet been made. Polcouns had earlier discussed the Iran Human 
Rights Council demarche with Alvarez, who told him that 
Uruguay would not/not support Iran's candidacy.
