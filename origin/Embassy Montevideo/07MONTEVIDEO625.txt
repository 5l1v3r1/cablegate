HYBRID OPERATION IN DARFUR 
 
REF: STATE 91542 
 
¶1. (SBU) On July 29, DCM separately delivered reftel demarche 
to the MFA's Director General for the Secretariat, Ambassador 
Jose Luis Cancela and to the Commander of the Army, 
Lieutenant General Jorge Washington Rosales. Per instructions 
reftel, he urged the GOU to contribute troops, military 
observers, formed police units, and/or individual police for 
the upcoming UN/AU Hybrid operations in Darfur. PolCouns and 
A/DATT made similar demarches to mid-level officials and 
officers on the same day. 
 
¶2. (SBU) DirGen Cancela said that while Uruguay continues to 
be forward-leaning on PKO and recognizes the importance of 
the Dafur mission, the Uruguayan military is currently 
stretched to thin with its deployments in Haiti (MINUSTAH) 
and Congo (MINOC). General Rosales echoed Cancela's 
sentiments, adding that the six-month rotations of Uruguayan 
peacekeepers also placed an additional burden on PKO troop 
deployments. Rosales also stated that if the Uruguayan Armed 
forces were to receive some assistance (for example) to 
improve the condition of the equipment of his rotary wing or 
mechanized units, he would strongly consider contributing one 
of them to the hybrid operation in Darfur.
