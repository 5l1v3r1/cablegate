(SBU) On March 23, we delivered reftel points to Arti 
Hilpus, MFA Director for Security and Arms Control, 
concerning the Government of Italy's (GOI) response to 
the abduction of Italian journalist Daniele 
Mastrogiacomo.  Hilpus said the GOE was "deeply 
disappointed with Italy for giving in to terrorists." 
With Estonian soldiers serving in Afghanistan, the GOE 
is concerned that the GOI's actions may put its troops 
in more danger.  On March 27, MFA interlocutors informed 
us the GOE had decided not to make any public statements 
on the matter as many other countries have already 
voiced similar points criticizing the GOI's actions.
