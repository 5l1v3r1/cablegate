COUNCIL'S RESOLUTION 
 
REF: (A) STATE 132517 (B) TALLINN 00689 
 
(SBU) On August 12 we delivered reftel points (Ref A) 
to Acting MFA Director General for Security Policy, 
Arti Hilpus.  In a follow up meeting on August 14, 
Hilpus reiterated (Ref B) that while the GOE supports 
international efforts in Lebanon, it is still unlikely 
that the GOE will contribute to the international 
peacekeeping force due its current commitments in 
Afghanistan and Iraq.  However, Hilpus said that there 
are currently two Estonian soldiers serving in the 
UNCO as observers in Lebanon.  Depending on what 
happens to UNIFIL and UNCO, Hilpus said it may be 
possible to incorporate these two soldiers into the 
international peace keeping force as staff officers 
(though this has yet to be discussed within the MOD).
