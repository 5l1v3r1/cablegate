REF STATE 115371 
 
¶1. (SBU) On July 19 Poloff delivered reftel points 
to Jaan Hein, outgoing MFA Director for Eastern 
Europe and Central Asia and newly appointed Estonian 
Ambassador to Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, on 
Transnistria's proposed independence referendum. 
Hein told us that the GOE is in full agreement with 
the U.S. position, but as a statement from Estonia 
would not "fly high on anybody's radar screens in 
Moscow," Hein said the GOE was putting its efforts 
in making the EU's common position as robust and 
clear as possible. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a separate meeting on July 20, MFA 
Director General for Political Affairs Aivo Orav 
told us that Estonia and other likeminded members 
were requesting a statement from the EU Presidency 
with a demarche to be delivered to Moscow.  Orav 
indicated that Estonia is concerned that some EU 
members were pressing for a joint EU-Russia 
peacekeeping force in Transnistria.  Orav commented 
that this proposal was reminiscent of "Molotov- 
Ribbentrop", and only rewarded Russia without 
prising any concessions from Moscow.  "First let 
them withdraw from Moldova," argued Orav, "and then 
we should discuss this possibility."
