COUNTERNARCOTICS STRATEGY 
 
REF: A) STATE 110089 
 
(SBU) On August 8, we delivered reftel points to Arti 
Hilpus, MFA Director for Security and Arms Control 
Policy, on the rollout of the new Afghanistan counter- 
narcotics strategy.  On August 15, we met with Hilpus 
and provided an additional briefing.  Hilpus thanked us 
for the briefing and told us that the Government of 
Estonia (GOE) considers the new strategy timely and 
appropriate.  However, Hilpus cautioned us that "the 
question of possible aerial spraying of poppies should 
be approached with extreme caution," as Estonian troops 
are participating in a UK-led PRT in Helmand province, 
the epicenter of Afghanistan's poppy production.
