SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND REACTION TO THE END OF THE E-PASSPORT EXEMPTION 
 
REF: STATE 41656 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request, please see paragraph 7. 
 
¶2.  (U) Summary.  New Zealand expects hundreds of its citizens 
abroad may be inconvenienced by the end of the e-passport 
exemption for emergency travel and will lobby DHS to use its 
waiver authority liberally.  End summary. 
 
¶3.  (U) On May 6, Auckland Consul General discussed reftel 
policy update regarding the end of the e-passport exemption for 
emergency passports with David Philps, Passport Manager at the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs.  Philps is very familiar with U.S. 
visa regulations and was disappointed, though not surprised, to 
learn of the end of the exemption. 
 
¶4.  (U) Philps reported that virtually all passports issued in 
New Zealand are e-passports.  Further, unlike most countries, 
New Zealand also has passport offices overseas (in London and 
Sydney) that issue e-passports.  However, New Zealanders abroad 
who need emergency passports and are not in those cities will 
have to get a machine readable passport from the nearest NZ 
embassy or high commission.  Philps estimated that such posts 
issue 700 emergency, machine readable passports annually. 
 
¶5.  (U) Philps lamented that the end of the exemption would hurt 
people already in difficult straits - New Zealanders abroad who 
must return home on short notice to deal with personal 
emergencies.  Many New Zealanders in Europe make their way home 
via the U.S.  Those rushing home to deal with family tragedies 
and other emergencies will now have the additional burden of 
getting a U.S. visa merely to transit through on their way home. 
 
¶6.  (U) Philps did not suggest New Zealand would reciprocate and 
require Americans to travel on e-passports.  He was aware that 
inspectors at U.S. ports of entry have discretion to waive, 
without a fee, the e-passport requirement.  He plans to work 
through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and New Zealand's 
Embassy in Washington to push DHS to encourage its inspectors to 
be liberal with their waiver authority. 
 
¶7.  (U) Action request.  Reftel takes note of the waiver 
authority, but does not provide guidance to posts on what can be 
shared with host governments regarding waivers.  Guidance as to 
what we can say to the NZG about how CBP will use its waiver 
authority would be helpful.
