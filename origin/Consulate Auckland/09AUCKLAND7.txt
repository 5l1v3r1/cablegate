¶1.  (U) Wellington A/DCM and Auckland Consul General met January 
27 with Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials 
Catherine Nicol (Americas Division) and Lyndal Walker (Consular 
Division) to discuss the VWP letter from DHS A/S Baker.  CG 
reviewed the points in ref A, explaining the legislative 
background to the new VWP requirements and our preference to 
address the requirements through the PCSC agreement or 
implementation of the 5CC protocol.  He also noted in very 
general terms some of the New Zealand-specific points made in 
ref B. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U) Nicol and Walker had no immediate response.  They 
expressed appreciation for the background on the situation and 
promised to coordinate with other appropriate NZG agencies. 
They were very interested in more details on next steps, 
specifically when the next round of discussions on signing the 
PCSC agreement or implementing the 5CC protocol would take place.
