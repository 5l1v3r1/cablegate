¶1.  (SBU) On November 8 and 9, King Abdullah made his first 
public statements regarding the Saudi-Yemeni border clashes 
that broke out on November 3 (reftels).  The absence of any 
public statements from Senior Royals has been notable given 
the heavy media coverage of the Saudi military campaign. 
 
¶2.  (U) Late in the evening on November 8, news outlets 
reported King Abdullah's statement that Saudi Arabia was 
"strong enough to deter any aggressor."  The King made this 
statement following a meeting with Kuwait's First Deputy PM 
and Minister of Defense Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak, who had 
delivered a letter of support from Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah 
Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. 
 
¶3.  (U) On November 9, the King elaborated on these 
statements during the weekly Council of Ministers meeting. 
According to the Saudi Press Agency, he expressed his 
appreciation to the leaders of Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, and 
other Gulf, Arab, and Islamic countries for their 
condemnation of the "attack against the territory of the 
Kingdom" and their support for the SAG's "actions taken to 
maintain security and stability and protect its citizens." 
In addition, he stressed that Saudi Arabia "would not 
tolerate any violation of its sovereign territory." This 
"illegal infiltration" gave Saudi Arabia the "right to take 
all measures" to end it, he continued, while taking the 
necessary measures to protect its citizens and its territory; 
secure its borders; deter aggressors; "put an end to all of 
those tempted to engage in infiltration or sabotage"; and 
limit its recurrence in the future.
