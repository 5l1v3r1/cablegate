RIBBON-CUTTING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 45884 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU)  As per request in reftel, Embassy delivered a 
diplomatic note with a request that Saudi Arabia refrain from 
sending a representative to the ribbon-cutting ceremony for 
the Natanz Nuclear Fuel Enrichment Plant in Iran.  In 
follow-up conversations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
International Organizations Bureau Director of Disarmament, 
Counselor Nayif al-Sudeiri noted the Saudi position on 
Iranian nuclear activities "remained very clear.  We have 
asked Iran to cooperate with all Security Council resolutions 
on nuclear issues, and we want to see more cooperation." 
International Affairs Office Director Aqeel noted that 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General 
Dr. Mohammed ElBaradei visited Riyadh on 11 April, and met 
with King Abdullah to discuss mutual concerns.  Nonetheless, 
the MFA has been unable to date to tell us if the Saudi 
Embassy in Tehran sent a representative to the 
ribbbon-cutting ceremony, although our interlocutors agree it 
is unlikely, given Saudi views on Iranian nuclear activity.
