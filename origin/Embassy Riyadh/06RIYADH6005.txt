E.O. 12958: DECL: 07/29/2016
TAGS: PREL PGOV SA LE
SUBJECT: SAG RESPONSE: NEW YORK FORCE GENERATION MEETING
FOR LEBANON ON MONDAY

REF: SECSTATE 124162

Classified By: Ambassador James C. Oberwetter for reasons 1.4 (b) and (
d).

¶1. (C) Ambassador spoke with Foreign Minister Prince Saud
al-Faisal July 29 by telephone to discuss reftel demarche,
which Post had earlier transmitted via diplomatic note to the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Foreign Minister responded
that the Saudis would not provide troops for peacekeeping
efforts in Lebanon, and he declined to commit to sending a
SAG delegation to New York. He did say that they would be
interested in learning the outcome of the meeting.

¶2. (C) COMMENT: Saudi Arabia has historically been unwilling
to commit troops to international peacekeeping efforts. Its
recent commitment of $1.5 billion in aid to Lebanon reflects
the Kingdom's commitment to resolving the current crisis,
albeit by non-military means. END COMMENT.
