REF:  (A) SECSTATE 16172, (B) UNVIE 72, (C) STATE 15263 
 
-------------- 
Reorganization 
-------------- 
 
¶1. (U) Ambassador contacted UNODC Executive Director Antonio Costa 
on February 23 and delivered points in Ref A, noting in particular 
that the USG sought to maintain the current balance between the 
normative work of the Division of Treaty Affairs (DTA) and the 
programmatic work of the Division of Operations (DO), and (2) the 
independence of the Independent Evaluation Unit (IEU). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In response, Costa told Ambassador that he needed to 
suppress 15 positions and that the proposed merger of the DTA and 
the DO (Ref B) was not meant to change priorities but to suppress a 
position.  He added that he would retain the independence of the 
IEU, which is to be merged into another unit as a way to suppress 
another position.  According to Costa, a session is being scheduled 
to consult member states.  He stressed that such reorganization 
would not be necessary if member states provided more support for 
general purpose funds.  He welcomed the news that the USG is working 
to raise its level of un-earmarked contributions for FY2010 (Ref 
A). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to Costa's chief of staff, there is no definite 
date for consultation with member states, because Costa is still 
awaiting proposals from various senior staff members.  He promised 
to let us know as soon as there is a definite date.  Counselor 
reiterated to him the importance of Costa consulting member states 
before making any final decision.

¶4.  (SBU) Costa used the occasion express to Ambassador his desire 
to meet with Ambassador Holbrooke and General Petraeus to discuss 
Afghan opium.  He is willing to travel anywhere in Europe for a 
meeting.  We understand per Ref C that Ambassador Holbrooke will 
visit Brussels "soon" for formal consultations at NATO, and 
recommend highly a meeting between him and Costa in Brussels.
