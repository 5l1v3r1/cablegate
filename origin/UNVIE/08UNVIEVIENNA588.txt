¶1.  (SBU) Ambassador will host the second meeting of the 
Vienna Friends of Afghanistan group (Ref b) on November 18. 
(Note:  List of Friends follows in para 5.  End Note.)  UNODC 
Executive Director Antonio Costa has been invited to give a 
presentation on UNODC's activities in Afghanistan, as well as 
UNODC's response to an internal evaluation report of its 
Afghanistan operations.  In addition, we have proposed a 
discussion of the October 10 decision taken by NATO defense 
ministers in Budapest regarding ISAF's role in 
counternarcotics operations in Afghanistan, a shift that 
Costa had strongly advocated.  We will also seek to encourage 
continued close consultation between UNODC and NATO 
officials.  This Friends meeting can be a useful venue to 
guage, very informally, member countries' reaction to this 
decision, and UNODC's views on how this can increase the 
effectiveness of counternarcotics operations in Afghanistan. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  At the end of the meeting, we plan to review areas 
for future discussions.  France is prepared to host the third 
meeting of the Group and has suggested precursors and 
anti-corruptions as possible topics for future meetings. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The full agenda for the meeting are: 
 
(i) Update from Afghan Mission in Vienna 
(ii) UNODC's activities in Afghanistan 
      - Comprehensive overview 
      - Response to recommendations from internal evaluation 
report 
(iii) Implication of NATO's Decision on ISAF's Role in 
Counternarcotics 
(iv) Areas of Future Discussions 
 
¶4. (SBU) Mission requests Washington-cleared talking points 
for discussions on the third agenda item concerning the 
recent NATO decision on Afghan counternarcotics. We ask that 
these cover the U.S. planned response to the NATO decision 
plus any encouragement for other countries to take similar 
steps.  We would also appreciate any thoughts about areas of 
future discussion for the Group.
