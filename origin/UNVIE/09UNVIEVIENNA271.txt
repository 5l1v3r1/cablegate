¶1.  (SBU) Ambassador Schulte passed ref A advice to Iraqi 
Ambassador Aqrawi on June 10, for which Aqrawi was grateful. 
Ambassador Schulte advised him to make a statement at the 
June Board of Governors meeting under Any Other Business 
(AOB) requesting the Secretariat to prepare a report on 
Iraq's compliance with its safeguards for consideration at 
the September 2009 Board meeting.  Aqrawi shared that in aQ\Gch it hopes to have by tomorrow. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Mission recommends that USDEL be instructed to 
support the Iraqi request under AOB, given the U.S. 
commitment to help Iraq lift UN Security Council 
restrictions.  Mission requests guidance on endorsing the 
Iraqi request and notes that we do not plan to address any 
other issues under AOB at this juncture.  Further, we propose 
that our colleagues in Embassy Baghdad may wish to confirm 
with appropriate MFA contacts.
