SUBJECT: UNODC URGES DONORS TO USE ADAM 
 
REF: UNVIE 284 
 
¶1.  In a June 22 meeting with Charge and UK Ambassador, UNODC 
Executive Director Antonio Costa gave his positive response 
to the May 27 joint U.S.-UK letter requesting UNODC to expand 
its benchmarks for measuring counternarcotics successes in 
Afghanistan (Septel).  In the course of this meeting, Costa 
brought up the need for donors to better coordinate their 
assistance, and lamented donors' failure to provide data to 
UNODC's Automated Donor Assisstance Mechanism (ADAM).  (Note: 
ADAM is a UNODC created database for donor assisstance to 
Afghanistan.  It can only be useful if donors update their 
data continuously.  End Note.)  This is an issue highlighted 
by the independent consultant whom UNODC hired to evaluate it 
Paris Pact Initiative, and also noted by participants at a 
recent donors meeting mission convened (Reftel). 
 
¶2.  ACTION REQUEST: Although UNVIE has had email exchanges 
with Washington regarding this problem, Mission would 
appreciate Washington guidance on how to respond to Costa's 
concern, to include any recommendations as to how ADAM might 
become a more useful tool for those coordinating Afghan donor 
programs.
