¶1.  (SBU)  Officials from the Central Public Health Lab at 
the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) and NAMRU-3 
confirmed on December 24 two new cases of H5N1 and a probable 
third in a family in the northern governorate of Gharbia, the 
most recent human cases since October (reftel).  All three 
succumbed to the disease.  Assuming the third case is 
confirmed, a total of ten people have died out of eighteen 
diagnosed with avian influenza in Egypt since the virus was 
first discovered in humans in February, 2006. 
 
¶2. (SBU)   On December 14, a twenty-six year old male from 
the village of Kafr Alhanoot, approximately 55 miles north of 
Cairo, developed flu-like symptoms.  On December 17, he and a 
thirty year old female family member were admitted to the 
Zifta Fever Hospital.  On December 20, a third family member, 
a fifteen year old female, was admitted with the same 
symptoms, and shortly after all three were transferred to 
Abbassiya Chest Hospital in Cairo and administered Tamiflu. 
The two females succumbed to the virus on December 24 and 25, 
while the male died on December 27. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Though all initially denied having contact with 
poultry, the victims were among at least twenty family 
members living in a forty square meter communal house with 
poor ventilation and no windows that also housed a flock of 
ducks.   The mother of the fifteen year old victim told MOHP 
that ten young ducks living in the house died in early 
December and three more died on December 12.  She slaughtered 
the remainder on December 13, though she and all other family 
members tested negative for H5N1.  Health authorities in 
Gharbia examined residents in the village for AI symptoms, 
but found no other cases.  They also interviewed local 
residents who indicated their domestic poultry had not been 
vaccinated against H5N1.
