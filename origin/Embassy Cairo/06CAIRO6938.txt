(SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche and non-paper to Dr. 
Hossam Aly, Director of the Disarmament Office at the MFA on 
November 20.  Dr. Aly was aware of U.S. concerns regarding 
Arak, but said Egypt takes the position that the TC should 
not be "politicized" with this issue.  He added that the 
Egyptians believe more focus should be placed on the 
activities of non-NPT countries.  Dr. Aly referenced a 
statement made by the Egyptian delegation in the meetings 
although post has not yet obtained the text.
