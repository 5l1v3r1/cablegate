¶1. (SBU) In an unexpected December 15 development, the 
military court which is trying forty members of the Muslim 
Brotherhood (MB) reportedly dropped charges against the 
defendants of "participating in a terrorist organization" 
(which carries the death penalty) and money laundering. 
According to press reports, the sole charge remaining against 
the group of defendants is "membership in an illegal 
organization." (Note: According to Egyptian law, the MB is 
technically banned. End note).  The MB's third-most senior 
official, Second Deputy Supreme Guide Khairat Al Shatir and 
MB member and businessman Hassan Malik reportedly are still 
charged with managing companies that finance the MB.  The 
military tribunals have been ongoing since April 26, and only 
thirty-three of the MB defendants are in custody; the other 
seven are being tried in abstentia.  To date, the GOE has 
ignored four decisions by various civil courts that ruled 
against the use of the military tribunals, and ordered the 
release of the detainees (ref A). 
 
¶2. (SBU) The MB's website trumpeted that the dropping of the 
charges is "unprecedented in the history of Egyptian military 
justice," and indeed, legal experts we contacted could not 
recall a similar circumstance in Egypt's long experience with 
military tribunals.  MB sources were quoted in the 
international and local media as stating that, "The dropping 
of the word 'terrorism' augurs well for a more lenient 
verdict than we could have expected."  MB sources are also 
quoted as anticipating that closing statements in the trial 
will be delivered shortly.  The military tribunal is 
currently adjourned for the Eid al Adha holiday, and is due 
to recommence on December 23.
