2.(U) The Ministry of Trade and Industry reported that Egypt's exports to its trading partners under the Arab Mediterranean Free Trade Agreement (Agadir Agreement)were US$586 million from January to May 2009, a 22% rise compared to the same period in 2008. Egypt signed the Agadir Agreement in 2004 along with Jordan, Tunisia and Morocco.
