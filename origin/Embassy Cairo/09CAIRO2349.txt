2.(U) A source in the state-owned Egyptian General Petroleum Company (EGPC) told Al Masry Al Youm newspaper that the company will offer a global public tender for oil production for 2011-2017. Al Masry Al Youm writes that the EGPC is planning to offer the tender because it badly needs to raise cash to pay its debts of at least LE 3 billion (US$547 million) to foreign oil and gas companies (Al Masry Al Youm, 12/15/09). ----------------------------------------- PM Nazif Speaks to Cairo Investment Forum -----------------------------------------

3.(U) In a speech to the Cairo Investment Forum, Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif said that Egypt would not resort to protectionism to deal with the economic crisis, and would instead focus on attracting foreign investment.

4.(U) The Egyptian Shura Council approved a new draft law for the regulation of nuclear activities, which lays out the guidelines for the construction of nuclear power plants and provides for the establishment of a nuclear regulatory commission. The draft law will be sent to the People's Assembly and the President's office for approval before it is enacted (All newspapers, 12/14/09). -------------------------------------------- Turkey Plans to Increase Investment in Egypt --------------------------------------------

5.(U) Minister of Trade and Industry Rachid M. Rachid said that President Mubarak's meeting with Turkish President Abdullah Gul led to an agreement to enhance transportation between the two countries to facilitate trade.
