SUBJECT: EGYPT AND THE ARAB LEAGUE ON THE NEW U.S. SUDAN 
STRATEGY 
 
REF: A. STATE 109669 B. CAIRO 2129 C. CAIRO 2130 Classified By: Minister Counselor for Economic and Political Affairs Donald A. Blome for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
1.(U) In response to reftel demarche, poloff discussed the new U.S. strategy on Sudan with the Government of Egypt and the Arab League on November 10. Note: Subsequent to the October 19 rollout of the new USG strategy on Sudan (reftel a), A/S Carson discussed Sudan with Egyptian interlocutors during his October 27 visit (reftels b and c). End note.

2.(C) Mohamed El Mullah, Egyptian MFA Cabinet Advisor for African Affairs told poloff on November 10 the Government of Egypt (GoE) believes the new U.S. strategy on Sudan represents no significant change. He said the reference to the use of carrots and sticks had been expected by the Egyptians. El Mullah said the emphasis on improvements on the ground and the idea of engagement with the Government of Sudan were "positive aspects." He said a lot will depend on how the Sudanese government responds to the new USG strategy, and the Egyptians were waiting for Khartoum's response.

3.(C) EGIS Chief Soliman told A/S Carson October 27 (ref b) that the GoE supports the "full implementation" of the CPA, but is concerned about the current political direction toward the separation of southern Sudan. Soliman said Egypt's three-track plan is to encourage CPA implementation and unity, provide southern Sudan with development assistance, and help the South Sudanese people understand the "price of separation." The Egyptians have consistently expressed concern that separation would leave the south without oil revenues, currency, banking, passports, or defined borders, which will result in a renewed North-South conflict. Soliman asked A/S Carson October 27 whether there was another alternative to the January 2011 referendum such as postponement for 3-4 years, granting autonomy, or having an interim period before full independence would be granted.

4.(C) Zeid Al Sabban, African Affairs Advisor to Arab League SYG Amr Moussa, told poloff November 10 that the language in the new U.S. policy was appropriate to deal with the "inherent contradictions" in Sudan. He said the U.S. policy encourages the Sudanese to "take a leading role in their future." Sabban encouraged cooperation between the USG and AL to help Sudan develop a democratic society and live in peace. Scobey
