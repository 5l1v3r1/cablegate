2.(U) Minister of Investment Mahmoud Mohieddin inaugurated an office of the China Development Bank, the first branch of a Chinese bank to be opened in Egypt. The bank's establishment comes on the heels of the China-Africa summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, in which Egypt and other African nations pledged expanded economic ties with China.

4.(U) According to new data released by the government's Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS), urban inflation increased to 13.3% during the month of October, up from 10.8% in September 2009. Alia El Mahdi, Professor of Economics at Cairo University, told Al Masry Al Youm that the rising inflation rate mainly impacts low and middle-income households, leading to higher poverty rates (Al Masry Al Youm, 11/11/2009). --------------------------------------------- ------ Egyptian Banks Establish Nile Basin Investment Fund --------------------------------------------- ------

7.(U) Following President Mubarak's call for more government support for farmers at the recent NDP conference, a ministerial committee will consider a Ministry of Agriculture proposal to increase the prices paid to farmers for "strategic crops." The proposal would increase the prices paid by the government for wheat, corn, cotton, rice, and sugar cane by 20-25% from their current levels to match the international prices.
