SUBJECT: NOTE VERBALE FROM FM ABOUL GHEIT TO SECRETARY RICE 
ON FMF 
 
Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. 
 
(SBU)  On December 3, Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit 
delivered to the Ambassador a note verbale, dated December 1, 
for Secretary Rice concerning the House of Representatives 
proposal to condition USD 200 million in FMF for FY2008.  The 
full text of the note follows: 
 
Begin text: 
 
I would like to seek your good offices to address the 
Congress once again regarding the unhelpful stipulation in 
the House of Representatives' version of the State Department 
and Foreign Appropriations Bill 2008 to withhold 200 million 
dollars from the Foreign Military Finances (FMF) earmarked to 
Egypt. 
 
I have been personally following the contacts of our Embassy 
in Washington with the members of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate.  I have come to the opinion 
that a high level intervention by yourself is now timely and 
much needed to give the final push towards lifting such 
stipulations from the final version of the bill coming out of 
the conference.  I am confident as to your sincerity and 
eloquence in transmitting the message, as you did before in 
your joint letter with Secretary of Defense and again in your 
testimony before the House Foreign Relations Committee, that 
such conditionality can not be but detrimental to the 
long-term relations between our two countries. 
 
It is to the benefit of these mutual bilateral interests, and 
for fear of an inevitable negative public reaction to the 
adoption of language that would be widely considered in Egypt 
as interventionist on the part of the United States, that I 
seek your help on this matter.  I look forward to your role 
as I know you are a strong supporter of healthy and solid 
Egyptian-American relations.
