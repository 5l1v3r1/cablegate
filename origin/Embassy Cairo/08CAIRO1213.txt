¶1. (SBU) MFA Counselor for UN Affairs Yasser Naggar told us 
on June 12 that, later that same day, the MFA would instruct 
its delegation in New York to accept the UN DPKO's request to 
replace one of four companies in Egypt's second infantry 
battalion for the UN/AU Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) with an 
engineering company.  The engineering company would deploy 
with the three infantry companies for one year, he said, 
after which it would be replaced by the previously scheduled 
fourth infantry company.  Naggar explained that the GOE had 
already responded to the UN that it was unwilling to 
temporarily transfer engineers to UNAMID from Egypt's UN 
Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) contingent (reftels) due to its 
commitments to other African nations against "cross 
borrowing" from active peacekeeping missions.  Subsequently, 
the UN requested that Egypt instead replace a number of the 
infantry troops planned for Egypt's second of two infantry 
battalions with engineers, which the Egyptian MOD had 
originally opposed.  The MOD eventually reversed its decision 
and approved this plan, Naggar said. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Naggar launched into a tirade on the GOE's 
frustration with the UN DPKO over UNAMID, saying "they had no 
plan and still have no plan" to ensure effective deployment 
of more than 30,000 troops.  He complained that "they 
constantly changed their minds" on where the Egyptian 
contingent was to deploy, and that the UN had not adequately 
secured Egyptian military equipment sent to Darfur.  Reading 
from notes of an MFA-MOD meeting, he said that military 
equipment sent from Cairo had been left unsecured in a 
storage location near Port Sudan and had subsequently been 
damaged (NFI).  Naggar also registered frustration that, with 
the departure from post of an Egyptian Deputy Head of Sector, 
Egypt - a large contributor to UNAMID - no longer had any 
high-ranking officials in the UNAMID command structure. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Naggar also complained that it was not proper for 
the UN to ask governments - particularly the U.S. and U.K. - 
to demarche Egypt on its behalf.  Separately on June 12, UK 
poloff Martin Hetherington told us that Naggar had made the 
same points to him in a meeting to discuss Egypt's 
engineering contribution the previous day, and had been even 
more vehement in his criticism of the UN DPKO.
