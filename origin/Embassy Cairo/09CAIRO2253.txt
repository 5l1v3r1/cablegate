 Â¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel request, Pol Off met with 
registered broker Helal Hussein at the offices of Egyptian 
Tech and Commercial Services Associates (ETSA).  Hussein 
confirmed that he was authorized by the Egyptian Ministry of 
Defense to conduct brokering activities in Egypt.  The firm 
only provides consulting services, so the firm does not 
physically handle or store any items on the United States 
Munitions List (USML).  The company was established in 1996 
and employs 12 total employees. Hussein said that 70 percent 
of his work was importing spare parts for automobiles. 
Hussein confirmed that he was familiar with restrictions on 
USML items, including the unauthorized re-transfer and 
re-export of items.  He is a retired military officer.
