2.(U) Text of Sorour's letter to President Obama: BEGIN TEXT: Honorable Mr. Barack Hussein Obama President of the United States of America Washington, D.C. Dear Mr. President, On the occasion of your election as President of the United States of America, I am pleased to express my sincere and heartfelt congratulations on behalf of the members of the People's Assembly of Egypt and my own behalf. Your election as President of the United States of America, gave us a great hope in establishing a new world order and eliminating all forms of oppression and injustice. In view of the hardships, crises and wars witnessed by the world, we hope that your era will positively reflect on the lives of the peoples of the world and particularly those of the Middle East who are yearning for establishing peace and stability in this vital area of the world. We believe that the dialogue is the best means to achieve international security and peace and not the language of artillery and tanks. We are looking forward to further promote (sic) the friendly relations between the United States and Egypt. We are sure that you are keen to strengthen the close ties between our two countries and give them a new impetus in the framework of mutual cooperation in all areas, especially on the Parliamentary level. Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest consideration. Sincerely, Dr. Ahmed Fathi Sorour President of the People's Assembly of Egypt END TEXT SCOBEY
