¶1.  (U) In addition to a public statement made by Foreign 
Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit (reftel) that welcomed the 
formation of a new government in Baghdad, President Mubarak 
sent congratulatory telegrams to both new Iraqi Prime 
Minister, Nour El Maliki, and Iraqi President Jalal Talabani. 
 According to Egyptian state media, Mubarak asserted in his 
May 25 messages that the formation of the new government was 
a "great achievement along the road of Iraq's ongoing 
political process."  Mubarak reportedly expressed his hope 
that additional achievements would be forthcoming "in the 
service of Iraq's national interests."  Prime Minister Nazif 
wrote to PM Maliki in his May 26 message that Egypt wished 
for the Iraqi government and people "prosperity, security, 
and stability." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: During a recent conversation on other 
topics with the Ambassador, Presidential Spokesman and Senior 
Advisor Soliman Awad made a point of mentioning Mubarak's 
messages to the Iraqi government, stressing that Egypt would 
look to establish working ties and strengthened relations 
with the new leadership in Baghdad.  The messages have also 
been widely reported in the Egyptian media.  End comment.
