REF: STATE 23829 
 
Per reftel request, we contacted Said A. Raghab, Production 
Director at the Abu Zaabel Company for Specialty Chemicals on 
April 17.  Raghab confirmed the company's request for reftel 
commodity, the Strand Burner System.  He also confirmed that 
this system will be used for testing composite propellant 
grains for the production of 155 mm ammunition projectiles. 
Raghab said he has worked for the company for 35 years and is 
aware of U.S. export control regulations.  He explained to us 
precisely how the system conducts these tests.
