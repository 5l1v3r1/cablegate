PRESIDENT'S PUBLIC REMARKS ON ISRAEL 
 
REF: A. STATE 199863

¶1.  Sensitive but unclassified.  Please handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The GOE position on Iranian President 
Ahmadi-Nejad's recent comments calling for Israel's 
destruction (reftels) was expressed by Foreign Minister Ahmed 
Aboul Gheit to reporters October 30.  Aboul Gheit told 
journalists that "the United Nations, in which Israel and 
Iran are both members, has never witnessed the dismantling of 
any state."  Remarks of this nature, Aboul Gheit added, "did 
not help the peace process between Israel and the 
Palestinians."  Aboul Gheit used the opportunity to highlight 
Egypt's "maximum efforts" to establish a Palestinian state. 
(Note:  Egyptian opposition newspaper Al Wafd criticized 
Aboul Gheit October 31 for "defending Israel" and for 
"getting involved in the war of words between Israel and 
Iran."  End note).  Foreign Ministry contacts confirmed the 
accuracy of press reporting on Aboul Gheit's public 
statements on this subject. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Similarly, Arab League Secretary General Moussa 
distanced himself from the Iranian President's statements 
during a taped television interview with Egyptian TV October 
30 -- to be aired November 1 - according to his Chief of 
Staff, Hesham Youssef.  Youssef shared October 31 that Moussa 
responded to a question on this issue by saying that the Arab 
League was focused on implementation of the Arab peace 
initiative and progress on the Roadmap, not elinimation of 
any state.  "While nothing can justify the statement by the 
Iranian President," Youssef told poloff, it appears that the 
Iranian government is now "backing down" from its bellicose 
statements and is now seeking to "clarify" Ahmadi-Nejad's 
comments.
