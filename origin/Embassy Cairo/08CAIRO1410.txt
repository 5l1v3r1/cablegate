¶1. (SBU) On July 1, the Ambassador pressed Deputy Foreign 
Minister Wafaa Bassim for Egypt to recognize Kosovo.  Bassim 
repeated previous Egyptian objections to Kosovo recognition 
(ref C), noting that Kosovo's declaration of independence 
came "outside of international law" and worrying that it 
might be a precedent for other separatist movements. 
However, she said Egypt had not closed the door on 
recognition but was in no hurry to make a decision.  The 
Ambassador countered per ref A demarche, pointing out that 43 
countries have already recognized Kosovo, violence has been 
low, the transition from UNMIK to EULEX is progressing, and 
that Kosovo's independence has not spawned other separatist 
movements, and asked if the GOE might be willing to receive a 
high-level delegation from Kosovo.  Bassim repeated the 
previous MFA position that they would have to internally 
consult on any such request (ref C). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Given the GOE's reluctance, we suggest 
Kosovo representatives consider a sub-ministerial approach 
whenever the opportunity presents itself, including outside 
of Egypt.  We will continue to highlight possibilities to the 
GOE when they arise.
