SUBJECT: OPEC EMERGENCY MEETING IN CAIRO 
 
(U) On Saturday November 29, regional oil ministers gathered in 
Cairo for a meeting of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting 
States (OAPEC), to discuss recent oil and gas price volatility. 
OAPEC ministers agreed to refer EgyptQs proposal to address the 
impact of the global financial crisis on the energy and 
petrochemical sectors to the Arab League. Egyptian Minister of 
Petroleum Sameh Fahmy told the local press that the proposal sought 
to ameliorate the negative consequences of the global financial 
crisis in the oil, gas and petrochemical sectors.  The proposal will 
be submitted to the Arab LeagueQs first economic summit in Kuwait in 
January 2009.  According to the Egyptian press, an emergency session 
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting States (OPEC) was 
convened after the OAPEC meeting, at the Iranian representativeQs 
request. After the conclusion of the emergency meeting, Saudi oil 
minister Ali Al Naimi stated that the session focused on price 
developments, not on production levels.  He noted that the following 
meeting of OPEC, tentatively scheduled for December 17 in Algeria, 
would address production cuts.  Naimi added OPEC members were 
complying by their decision in October to reduce oil production.
