(SBU) On July 1, the Ambassador raised with Deputy Foreign 
Minister Wafaa Bassim the need for the international 
community to increase support to the World Food Program (WFP) 
for immediate needs in the Horn of Africa, and asked for 
Egypt to contribute financially and to consider providing 
naval escort support given imminent Dutch naval withdrawal. 
Bassim was non-committal on financial assistance but said she 
would pursue the possibility of providing naval escort 
support, and would check with the Ministry of Defense (MOD). 
MFA Cabinet Advisor for African Affairs Ahmed Abu Zeid 
confirmed with us on July 2 that he was following up this 
issue with the MOD.
