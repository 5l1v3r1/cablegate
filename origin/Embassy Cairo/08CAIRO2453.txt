SUBJECT: UPDATE ON DEPORTATION REQUEST:  CASE OF IYAD AHMAD 
ANWAR BADAWI, A97-374-624 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econ-Political MinCouns has raised the case of Mr. 
Badawi with Egyptian Deputy Assistant Foreign Minister Amin 
Meleika on three occasions:  November 13, November 23, and 
November 30.  On November 13, MinCouns orally explained the 
background of the case and asked if Egypt would allow Mr. 
Badawi to pass through Egypt into Gaza.  Meleika offered to 
look into the case, but requested more details in writing. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 23, MinCouns provided Meleika the 
information supplied on November 18 by NEA/ELA which dealt 
primarily with the immigration and fraud aspects of Mr. 
Badawi's deportation case.  Meleika then requested more 
details on USG concerns about Mr. Badawi's security issues, 
including possible ties to Hamas.  NEA/ELA sent this 
information on November 21, and MinCouns passed it to Meleika 
on November 23, stressing the time sensitivity of the 
request.  On November 30, MinCouns again asked Meleika what 
the status of the Badawi case was; Meleika reported that no 
decision had been made. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On each occasion that MinCouns raised the Badawi 
deportation case, Deputy Assistant Minister Meleika stressed 
the sensitive nature of any case involving a Palestinian and 
security concerns, and the fact that it would need careful, 
intra-GoE coordination before he could give a final response. 
 He did not think that the initial rejection of the case by 
the Egyptian Consul General in San Francisco in December 2007 
should be taken as final.  He promised to raise the case with 
the appropriate GoE entities, but said he could not promise 
when a definitive decision would be made. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Embassy's Homeland Security Working Group is 
fully engaged with this case, and we will continue to press 
for an early decision.  However, we note that with several 
major holidays approaching, it may be difficult for the GoE 
to coordinate a response before the end of December, as 
requested by the Department.
