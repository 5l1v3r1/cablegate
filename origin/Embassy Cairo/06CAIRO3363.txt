INSTITUTE TO SUSPEND OUTREACH WORK PENDING GOE APPROVAL OF 
REGISTRATION APPLICATION 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  ECPO Counselor and poloff attended a June 1 
meeting at the MFA between IRI country director Gina London 
and Assistant Minister for North American Affairs Salama 
Shaker, which Shaker had called to address the issue of IRI's 
pending registration in Egypt.  London apologized to Shaker 
for the delay in submission of the application and said that 
the delay was due to poor coordination between IRI and the 
Egyptian lawyer handling IRI's registration.  Shaker, 
expressing surprise about the scope of IRI's work in Egypt, 
urged IRI to submit its completed application as soon as 
possible; London said she would do so by the second week of 
June.  In response to London's inquiry about planned IRI 
activities for later in the month, including several training 
sessions for political party activists, Shaker strongly 
advised that IRI not proceed with any more public activities 
prior to receiving formal GOE registration.  "We are in a 
critical situation," Shaker advised London.  "We don't want 
you to be told to pack and go." 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  At several times during the meeting, Shaker 
reiterated her view--shared she said by her other MFA 
colleagues--that IRI, and similar groups like NDI, have much 
to contribute to Egypt's political reform process, but she 
also emphasized that the IRI must be registered before it 
conducts additional work in Egypt.  "Help us to help you do 
the excellent work that you need to do," Shaker told London. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Shaker asked emboffs to ensure that NDI and IFES, 
the other U.S.-based democracy organizations now working in 
Egypt with USAID support, make urgent arrangements to call on 
her on June 4 or 5.  Both groups have submitted their 
applications for formal registration to the MFA, but have not 
yet received approval.  Post has passed Shaker's request to 
NDI and IFES and will assist with scheduling the meetings. 
NDI, IRI, and IFES have all been the subject of several 
negative articles in the Egyptian press, including Rose 
Al-Youssef, the tabloid that is widely believed to be 
influenced by the elements in the security apparatus and the 
NDP leadership. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Comment:  The GOE is well aware of the presence 
and activities of IRI, NDI, and IFES.  Using the Consultative 
Group on Democracy and Governance Assistance, which has met 
on a monthly basis since early 2005, Post has kept the GOE 
apprised of directly-funded D&G initiatives, including the 
work of IRI, NDI, and IFES.  In addition, NDI regional 
representative Joe Hall briefed FM Aboul Gheit about NDI's 
plans in August 2005, and NDI President Ken Wollack met with 
various senior GOE officials, including Interior Minister 
Adly, and briefed them about NDI's work plans during a late 
2005 visit to Cairo.  IFES, for its part, worked closely with 
the GOE's State Information Service during preparation of a 
voting guide during the parliamentary elections.  The 
negative media attention--combined with recent discussions 
between FM Aboul Gheit and the Deputy Secretary, as well as 
the Ambassador, on the registration issue--has injected a new 
urgency to the formalization of their status under Egyptian 
law.  End comment.
