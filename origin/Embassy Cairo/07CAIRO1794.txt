¶1. (SBU) At a June 12 hearing of Egypt's State Council (the 
judicial body to which imprisoned Al Ghad Party leader Ayman 
Nour has appealed for a health-based release), presiding 
judge Mohamed Al Husseini ruled that a decision on Nour's 
appeal be delayed until June 26.  Additionally, as no new 
medical report on Nour's health was prepared by a 
governmental medical committee (as had been requested by the 
State Council at the last hearing on May 22), Husseini stated 
that a new assessment of Nour's health should be prepared by 
a panel of university professors of medicine, to be submitted 
to the State Council in advance of the June 26 hearing. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In the course of the June 12 proceedings, which 
poloff attended, Husseini asked Salem, "What is your opinion 
of foreign interference in Nour's case?"  Salem replied, "I 
do not care for foreign involvement in the country's 
political affairs, but I am asking for this release based on 
humanity towards Nour and his suffering family."
