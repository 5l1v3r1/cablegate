SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED ON NUCLEAR SECURITY SUMMIT SHERPAS 

MEETING REF: STATE 007493 CLASSIFIED BY: Matthew Tueller, DCM, DOS, Embassy Cairo; REASON: 1.4(B), (D)

1.(U) DCM and Dutch counterpart Otto Genee delivered jointly demarche in reftel January 27 to Khaled Shamaa, Deputy Assistant Minister for Disarmament Issues. Shamaa said Egyptian Ambassador to the U.S. Sameh Shukry would be the Egyptian Sherpa at the February 9-11 preparatory meeting in The Hague. Shamaa did not know who would be the additional Egyptian delegation members.

2.(C) Regarding the Nuclear Security Summit (April 12-13), Shamaa said he believes the focus should be on three separate areas: 1) safeguarding nuclear material and facilities; 2) anti-smuggling measures, e.g. those included in UNSCR 1540; and 3) nuclear terrorism. Building capacity of states is critical, Shamaa said, and he appreciated the Administration's focus on nuclear "security" (vice proliferation). He said individual states face different challenges with respect to nuclear security, therefore any framework developed should be flexible enough to accommodate these differences. Shamaa did not know whether President Mubarak would attend the summit. SCOBEY
