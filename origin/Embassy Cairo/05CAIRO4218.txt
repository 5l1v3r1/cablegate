¶1.  (U) In advance of the July 6 decision in Singapore by the 
International Olympic Committee (IOC), Post is bringing to 
the attention of Embassy visitors and contacts information 
related to New York City's bid and has distributed 
promotional materials received from the NYC2012 bid committee. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) To our knowledge, Egypt's two IOC members have not 
committed publicly to support any one of the five finalist 
cities.  Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit shared recently with us 
(ref B) that he personally is a strong supporter of New York, 
having served there as Egypt's Permanent Representative to 
the United Nations from 1999-2004, and that he recently sent 
a letter expressing his personal support to the Chairman of 
Egypt's Olympic Committee, General Thabet.
