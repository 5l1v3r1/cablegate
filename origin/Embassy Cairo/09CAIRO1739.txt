SUBJECT: EGYPT NOTIFIED OF DEPARTMENT OF LABOR LIST OF 
GOODS PRODUCED BY CHILD LABOR REF: SECSTATE 92560 Classified By: Economic-Political Minister-Counselor Donald A. Blome for reason 1.4(d) (C) We delivered reftel demarche to Deputy Assistant Foreign Minister for Human Rights Wael Aboul Magd notifying the GoE that Egyptian cotton and quarried limestone will be included on the forthcoming list of goods produced with child labor. Aboul Magd said that he would pass the information to Egypt's Ministry of State for Family and Population, the ministry most directly involved in addressing child labor. Aboul Magd had no substantive response other that to say that the listing of cotton and limestone "will not be a surprise to anyone." We will report any response to the public release of the list separately. Scobey
