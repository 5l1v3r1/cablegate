¶1. Cairo General Manager for Delta Air Lines Karim Nabhan 
told us that Delta plans to announce on September 26 the 
establishment of non-stop New York-Cairo-New York service 
beginning on June 4, 2008.  The flight will operate 5 times 
per week (SU,M,TU,W,F from JFK and M,TU,W,TH,SA from Cairo) 
and will utilize Boeing 767-300ER aircraft.  Currently, only 
EgyptAir operates a non-stop Egypt-U.S. service. 
 
¶2.  Nabhan said that existing demand and positive passenger 
growth forecasts are driving the decision, but Delta expects 
opportunities for air cargo growth as well.  The 
establishment of direct, non-stop service will spell the end 
of the current Paris CDG-Cairo codeshare agreement with Air 
France, although Air France will still handle some cargo 
business.  Delta's previous attempt at a non-stop JFK-Cairo 
service was short-lived -- Delta inaugurated the service in 
June 2001 and canceled it shortly after 9/11.
