REF: SECSTATE 4089 
 
¶1. We delivered reftel demarche to Hany Dimitri of the MFA 
International Organizations office on January 21, emphasizing 
Ambassador Swing's qualifications for the IOM Director 
General position and explaining the U.S. position against the 
incumbent.  Dimitri said that the GOE would study the IOM 
candidacy issue but is unlikely to decide on which candidate 
to support until the election is closer. 
 
¶2. Separately on January 21, we asked Amr Goweili, MFA 
cabinet advisor for multilateral relations, to support 
Ambassador Swing's request for a meeting with Egyptian 
Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit on the margins of the 
upcoming African Union Summit.  Goweili, who is accompanying 
Minister Aboul Gheit to the AU Summit, said he would study 
the issue and consult with Egypt's mission in Addis Ababa.
