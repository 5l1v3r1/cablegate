REVIEW CONFERENCE WORKING GROUP SESSION 
 
REF: A. STATE 14201B. GENEVA 133 Classified By: ECPO Mincouns William R. Stewart for reason 1.4 (b).
1.(C) We demarched MFA Deputy Assistant Minister for Human Rights Wael Aboulmagd February 22 on U.S. positions for the Durban Review negotiations (ref A), noting our awareness of the February 16 discussions in Geneva between the U.S. delegation and the Egyptian PermRep (ref B). Aboulmagd said the MFA passed instructions February 21 to the Egyptian Embassy in Washington to propose bilateral talks in Geneva the week of March 2 to discuss the issues further. Aboulmagd said he will be in Geneva the week of March 2 for the High Level Segment of the UN Human Rights Council, and that he hopes to engage with U.S. interlocutors at that time.

2.(C) Regarding the problematic language on Israel, Aboulmagd responded that Israel is not named in the current outcome document language, and that there is only one paragraph that mentions the "suffering of the Palestinian people under occupation." He said that the Palestinians are comfortable with this one paragraph, although some countries from the Asian Group wanted additional language. Aboulmagd noted that the GOE will not allow disagreement over language on the Palestinians to be a "deal-breaker" for the April review conference. Pressed on the GOE's position, Aboulmagd said, "it is difficult to determine how flexible we can be," and stressed that the Egyptians would be satisfied with language agreeable to the Palestinians. He accused "U.S. pressure groups" of using "false terms such as Zionism equals racism" to describe the current language, and said, "there is absolutely nothing to substantiate such charges." He noted that the GOE is "very aware of the domestic pressures facing the USG."

3.(C) Regarding the defamation of religion proposal that restricts free expression, Aboulmagd responded that this language would also not be a "deal-breaker," and that the GOE is willing to discuss it. He said GOE flexibility on the issue will depend on how the U.S. responds to the GOE's proposal for bilateral talks and on how those discussions proceed. He distinguished between defamation of religion and incitement to religious hatred, saying that the GOE is concerned about the latter. He expressed "distress" over the U.S. using "grand concepts," such as restrictions on freedom of expression, when the issue is specifically incitement to religious hatred. Regarding slavery reparations, Aboulmagd said it is "very sensitive" for the GOE to broach the subject with African countries because "it's not our issue and the Africans don't want us to engage on it."

4.(C) Comment: Aboulmagd is a key player in the GOE policy-making process on multilateral human rights issues, and appears to be more flexible on the Israel and defamation of religion issues than the Egyptian PermRep in Geneva. Therefore, we recommend that the Department consider agreeing to the GOE's proposal for bilateral discussions with Aboulmagd in Geneva the week of March 2. Aboulmagd is the most important Cairo-based official interlocutor on this issue below the Foreign Minister. Even if these talks in Geneva do not result in our desired outcome, our participation in the discussions could be useful in showing that we remain engaged with a key Arab state on the Durban review negotiations.
