 ¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On February 22, Egypt's lower house of 
Parliament, the Peoples' Assembly, passed a law banning 
demonstrations "inside or around places of worship." 
Although the law prohibits demonstrations in both churches 
and mosques, the law appears specifically to target the 
Muslim Brotherhood (MB) which frequently organizes protests 
in and around mosques following Friday prayers.  Human rights 
advocates have criticized the law, expressing concern that 
the GOE could eventually use it as a tool to limit freedom of 
expression.  Despite the inclusion of churches in the ban, 
Coptic Church officials seem unconcerned, agreeing that the 
law probably targets the MB and is unlikely to affect the 
Church.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The law, reportedly drafted by the Ministry of 
Islamic Endowments, criminalizes "calling for or organizing" 
demonstrations inside and around places of worship. 
Demonstration organizers can be sentenced to up to one year 
in prison and fined up to LE 5,000.  Participating in 
demonstrations inside or around places of worship is also now 
illegal and carries a sentence of up to six months in prison 
and a fine of up to LE 2,000.  During legislative debate 
about the law (which the MB opposed), the Minister of Islamic 
Endowments, Mahmoud Zaqzouq, described the law as necessary 
to protect the sanctity of places of worship which he said 
"should not be turned into another Hyde Park."  We are not 
aware of any GOE attempts to enforce the new law. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The MB claims the law specifically targets its 
activities, and MB-affiliated members of parliament walked 
out in protest during debate over the measure.  MB members 
and supporters often gather outside of Cairo's famous Al 
Azhar Mosque and other mosques following Friday prayers, and 
human rights activists agree that the law is probably focused 
on such gatherings.  More generally, human rights activists 
have expressed their concern that the law, even if designed 
to control MB activities now, would eventually be applied 
more broadly to other demonstrations. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In a recent meeting, a leading Coptic Church bishop 
told us that he agreed with the MB's assertion that the law 
targets the MB, and, therefore, the Coptic Church is not 
concerned about it.  He added that Copts traditionally do not 
demonstrate in or around churches.  Church lawyers were more 
apprehensive and, while agreeing that the law is not aimed at 
the Coptic Church, were concerned about the future 
implications of what they described as a "vague" law. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: There is wide agreement that the law is 
directed against the MB's practice of staging demonstrations 
after Friday sermons.  As with much legislative and legal 
activity in Egypt, an assessment of the law's actual impact 
will depend on how, and if, the GOE attempts to implement it. 
The measure is, however, a further government warning to the 
MB that the government is watching its activities closely, 
and all the more as we approach the April 8th local 
elections.  End comment.
