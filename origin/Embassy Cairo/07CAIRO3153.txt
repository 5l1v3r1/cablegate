SUBJECT: EGYPT'S VIEWS ON UNGA THIRD COMMITTEE RESOLUTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 145641 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Poloffs met with MFA Deputy Minister for 
Human Rights Affairs Wael Aboulmagd on October 29 to discuss 
reftel points.  Aboulmagd said that Egypt generally does not 
support prohibitions on "no-action motions" or country 
specific resolutions. On the thematic resolutions, Aboulmagd 
said the MFA is now reviewing information it has on the draft 
resolutions and will respond more fully, but offered limited 
comments on the resolutions on rape as an instrument of state 
policy, defamation of religion, and the death penalty. End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) No-Action Motions/Country Specific Resolutions: 
Aboulmagd advised that Egypt generally works as part of 
country groups at UNGA, and is therefore constrained by group 
positions.  According to Aboulmagd, such positions are 
generally hostile to prohibitions on "no action motions" and 
country specific resolutions. Aboumagd also said that Egypt 
opposes the singling out of specific countries and its 
default position is to oppose country specific resolutions. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Rape as an Instrument of State Policy: Aboulmagd 
said he had heard that the draft resolution condemning rape 
as an instrument of state policy was narrowly focused and 
appeared targeted at specific conflicts.  He commented that 
minor revisions might make the resolution more broadly 
applicable and more likely to win wide support. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Defamation of Religion: Aboulmagd disagreed that 
previous Organization of Islamic Conference sponsored 
resolutions singled out Islam for special protection. He also 
said that an effort to create special protections for Islam 
would be contrary to Egyptian law. 
 
¶5. (SBU) EU Death Penalty Resolution: The EU draft resolution 
calling for a moratorium on the death penalty is problematic 
for Egypt. Aboulmagd said that because the death penalty has 
its source in Sharia law, any attempt to ban it would be 
extremely difficult. Aboulmagd added, however, that Egypt 
might be able to support some elements of the resolution.
