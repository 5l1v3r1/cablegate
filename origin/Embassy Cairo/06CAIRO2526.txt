¶1. (SBU) On the afternoon of April 30, Egypt's People's 
Assembly voted in favor of the government's proposed two year 
extension of the state of emergency.   In a midday address to 
the People's Assembly, Prime Minister Nazif alluded to last 
week's terrorist attacks in Dahab, Sinai, as he asked PA 
members to approve the extension.  He argued that the GOE 
must give security services the tools they need to defend the 
nation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In protest, the PA's 88 members from the Muslim 
Brotherhood, and several other opposition members, attended 
the session wearing black sashes which read "No to the State 
of Emergency."   Only 278 of the PA's 454 members were in 
attendance for the vote.  Of those, 187 voted for the 
extension and 91 opposed. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The extension had been widely expected, and indeed 
was previewed publicly by President Mubarak and other senior 
GOE officials.  In recent years, the law had been extended 
for three year intervals.  Minister for Parliamentary Affairs 
Mufeed Shehab told the media this would be the last time the 
emergency law would be extended. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Campaigning for reelection in the summer of 2005, 
Mubarak committed to rescinding the state of emergency, which 
has been in force since he took office following Sadat's 1981 
assassination, and replacing it with a modern 
counterterrorism law.  Several drafting committees are 
working on a new CT law, but none of our GOE contacts expect 
it to be ready this year.  Several senior GOE contacts have 
told us that the constitution will have to be amended to be 
compatible with an effective CT law. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Embassy civil society contacts, who have long 
opposed the emergency law, reacted with resignation to news 
of its extension, noting that the GOE had been clear in 
indicating its intent to do so. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: The state of emergency was set to expire at 
the end of May.  The GOE may have expedited renewal in the 
wake of last week's terror attacks in Sinai.  The GOE's 
extension by two rather than three years is consistent with 
its stated time frame for replacing the state of emergency 
with a modern CT law.  End comment. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) If asked about the extension, the Department may 
wish to draw from the following points: 
 
-- The United States has long expressed concern about Egypt's 
application of the State of Emergency and we are disappointed 
at its extension; 
 
-- We welcomed President Mubarak's commitment to replace the 
emergency law with a modern counterterrorism law and we look 
forward to seeing this commitment implemented as soon as 
possible; 
 
-- Egypt is a valued ally in the war on terror.  Recent 
events have highlighted the security challenges that it 
faces.
