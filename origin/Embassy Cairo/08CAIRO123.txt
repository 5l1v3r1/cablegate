SUBJECT:  GAZA BORDER UPDATE 
 
 
¶1.  A security contact confirmed to us that the Ministry of Defense 
would be trying to prevent additional Palestinians from entering 
Egypt today, January 25.  Egyptian Border Guard Forces are now 
deployed to create a form of barrier along the border at Rafah, but 
an opening exists to allow Palestinians to exit back to Gaza. 
 
¶2.  There also appears to be an effort underway to start patching 
the wall to create a more permanent barrier.  Egyptian Central 
Security Forces continue to make efforts (via roadblocks) to prevent 
Palestinians from moving beyond Al Arish city towards Cairo or into 
the Sinai.  According to press reports, Egyptian security forces are 
now performing checks on Palestinians.
