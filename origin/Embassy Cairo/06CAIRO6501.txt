¶1.  (SBU) GOE officials told econoff that the contract for sale of 
80 percent of the shares of Bank of Alexandria (BOA) to the Italian 
bank SanPaolo IMI would be signed on October 31.  The terms of the 
contract require Sanpaolo to deposit the $1.6 billion cost of the 
purchase into an escrow account held by the Egyptian Ministry of 
Finance (MOF) within 5 days.  Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Sub 
Governor Tarek Kandil told econoff that CBE's board of directors 
would approve the contract at its regular biweekly meeting November 
¶7.  Kandil predicted that the final sale, which will take place on 
the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchange, would be complete by the 
end of November.  The timeframe depends, however, on the Bank of 
Italy, which must also approve the final sale.  Kandil said that 
Sanpaolo was eager to conclude the sale quickly, and had already 
submitted a request for approval to the Bank of Italy. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) MOF officials confirmed Kandil's statements, and told 
econoff that MOF had agreed with Sanpaolo to expedite the final 
sale, as both sides wanted swift completion of the transaction.  The 
GOE badly needs the $1.6 billion in revenue from the sale while 
Sanpaolo needs to quickly invest liquidity generated by its recent 
merger with Banca Intesa. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  While the GOE's anticipated timeframe for 
completion of the BOA deal is somewhat ambitious, it is not 
unrealistic.  The lengthy period the GOE granted the short listed 
bidders to conduct due diligence on BOA and prepare final bids seems 
to have paved the way for smooth completion of the sale.  End 
comment.
