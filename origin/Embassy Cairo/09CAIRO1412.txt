Reasons: 1.4 (B) and (D)
1.(C) Summary. Global economic and political inequality was the central theme of the July 15-16 Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Sharm el Sheikh. A/DCM attended on behalf of the USG as a "guest" and observed President Mubarak to be tired, but holding to a vigorous schedule. Libyan leader Qaddafi entertained the summit with his usual eccentric behavior and world view. End summary.

2.(SBU) A/DCM attended the NAM Summit in Sharm el Sheikh July 15-16. While the foyer chatter indicated some "soul-searching" over the NAM's proper role in the 21st century, Raul Castro whipped up the crowd by highlighting global wealth inequality, epitomized by the 50 year USG embargo on Cuba. This theme characterized nearly every head of state intervention.

3.(C) President Mubarak appeared fatigued, paunchy and elderly. He read prepared remarks with a strained voice. However, Mubarak maintained a tough schedule, including bilateral meetings, constant handshaking, and the tedious role of chairman for a good portion of the opening session (NAM membership is 118 countries; each was allowed a five minute intervention).

4.(SBU) As he has done so many times before, Qaddafi managed to make himself the center of attention, dressed in a dark tiara and flowing ochre-colored robes. He was the only major speaker to speak without prepared remarks or notes, and focused on global political inequality. He argued that the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were designed to ensure the interests of the "so-called developed countries" that had wrought economic catastrophe on the world. Qaddafi called for creation of a NAM security council to counter the UNSC, which he said failed to represent the vast majority of the UN membership. Arab League Secretary General Amre Moussa told A/DCM he thought Qaddafi was in regular form, but that "I liked what he said." Other delegations also said they found Qaddafi's spontaneous style to be a refreshing contrast to the repetitive speeches most were instructed to deliver. Qaddafi also claimed that Libya had been on the verge of building a nuclear bomb, but had opted against production. "Who would we use it against."

5.(SBU) Iranian FM Mottaki appeared relaxed and took time to work the room, shaking hands and talking with as many leaders as he could. FM Mottaki had prepared a speech to deliver at the summit, but according to media reports there arose a disagreement as to whether his aides, or the Egyptian hosts, would disseminate copies of the remarks. As a result, the speech went undelivered. Moussa also decided not to deliver remarks, but instead focusing on bilateral meetings on the margins of the summit, according to AL Chief of Staff Hisham Yousef. Tueller
