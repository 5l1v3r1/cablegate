TAWFIK EL-RASHIDY - CASE NO. K-2307 
 
REF: STATE 99503 
 
 Â¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel request, Pol Off met with 
Tawfik el-Rashidy at the offices of the Kemet Corporation. 
El-Rashidy confirmed that he was authorized by the Egyptian 
Ministry of Defense to conduct brokering activities in Egypt. 
 Kemet Corporation primarily deals with commercial design 
software like Autodesk and Adobe, but also acts as agent for 
Westcom to provide mobile cameras to the Egyptian Air Force. 
Kemet Corporation does not physically handle or store any 
items on the United States Munitions List (USML).  The mobile 
cameras Kemet purchases go directly to the Egyptian military 
upon delivery.  The company was established in 1980 and has 
60 employees.  El-Rashidy confirmed that he was familiar with 
restrictions on USML items, including the unauthorized 
re-transfer and re-export of items.
