¶1. (SBU) In a May 8 meeting, Finance Minister Boutros Ghali informed 
the Ambassador of his candidacy for Chair of the IMF's Monetary and 
Financial Committee and asked for U.S. support.  The Ambassador told 
the Minister she was not the decision maker on this, but 
congratulated him for throwing in his hat and said she would make 
sure that Washington considered his candidacy seriously. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Boutros Ghali's qualifications and skills are well known in 
Washington.  We urge that he be given due consideration in the 
decision process.  As a former IMF staffer and an outspoken champion 
of economic reform, he has labored in difficult situations in Egypt 
for a long time, and under the current administration has finally 
been more able to reap some positive results.
