SUBJECT: INITIATIVES TO COUNTER TORTURE IN EGYPT 
 
REF: STATE 70129 
 
¶1. Torture is a serious problem in Egypt, and there are 
ongoing efforts in the country to prevent its practice and 
protect victims.  Several Egyptian NGOs have ongoing programs 
to provide legal assistance, and psychological and physical 
rehabilitation for torture victims.  Human rights attorneys 
routinely file suits against the government on behalf of 
torture victims.  NGOs also work to publicize torture cases 
involving police officers by engaging with the media and 
publishing lists of accused and convicted officers. 
Independent human rights groups consistently address torture 
in their annual reports. 
 
¶2. Bloggers have played a significant role in documenting and 
publicizing torture by police.  A blogger's post of a video 
recording of policemen torturing a bus driver caused domestic 
and international outrage, and in November 2007 a court 
sentenced the two officers to three years in prison.  A 
blogger posted a recording of a similar incident in February 
¶2009. 
 
¶3. The quasi-governmental National Council for Human Rights' 
annual report released in May calls on the GOE to pass 
legislation to broaden the definition of torture and increase 
the relevant penalties.  Currently, the law defines torture 
only in the context of extracting confessions.  In close 
cooperation with the GOE, the United Nations Development 
Program Human Rights Capacity Building Project, coordinated 
by a senior MFA official, trains officials from the Justice 
Ministry, Interior Ministry and Public Prosecutor's office. 
The UNDP project organizes lectures for GOE officials on 
combating torture and promoting human rights, focusing on UN 
human rights conventions and non-violent investigative 
techniques. 
 
¶4. We are working to resume a USG-funded community policing 
training program that addresses human rights.  USAID is 
funding a coalition of Egyptian NGOs to combat torture in 
police stations.  The NGOs will conduct a study in three 
governorates on incidents of torture and release a report in 
October.  USAID is also funding an Egyptian NGO to provide 
training for lawyers to recognize the signs of different 
types of torture, and to document torture cases.  USAID is 
working with another Egyptian NGO which has already trained 
30 lawyers to gather information on torture cases, and will 
develop a database of documented cases designed to assist 
lawyers, researchers and civil society. 
 
¶5. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to 
fund projects to combat torture and raise awareness of the 
problem.
