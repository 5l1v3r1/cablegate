¶1.

MG Fouad Abdel Halim added that MOD had instituted its own end-use training program in August for officers who were responsible for American equipment. --------------------------------------------- - End-Use Concerns, Systemic Improvements Needed --------------------------------------------- -

2.(C) Ambassador delivered ref A points in an October 10 meeting with Defense Minister Field Marshal Tantawi, stressing that despite the fact that holds had been lifted on F-16 sales to Egypt, the Administration and Congress both share deep concerns about a pattern of end-use violations in Egypt. Ambassador noted that the issue would need to remain high on the agenda of future MCC meetings, and emphasized the possibility that further violations could hold up future sales. She urged a vigorous and effective set of end-use safeguards and suggested Tantawi undertake a systematic internal review of administrative and procedural steps to ensure end-use restrictions are observed and personnel are properly trained. She reiterated the offer of USG assistance to implement these steps.

¶3. (C) Tantawi asked whether recent synchrolift violations had raised these concerns, suggesting conversion of the synchrolift agreement to dual military/civilian use could address them, and noting he had taken recent steps to ensure there would be no future violations on this equipment. Ambassador responded that it is the large number of violations, nine over the past three years, rather than any one specific case. The concern is systemic, and needs to be addressed that way.

¶4. (C) Assistant Minister of Defense for Policy Major General Mohammed Al-Assar noted that the Defense Ministry was working closely with OMC to remedy gaps in training and procedures. Assistant Minister of Defense for Armaments Major General Fouad Abdel Halim, designated following the August 2 visit of PM PDAS Tom Countryman (ref B) to oversee end-use procedures, said the GoE has instituted training programs for all officers, including the Navy, working on FMF-supported programs. Fouad said the MOD had begun implementing new training programs with OMC since August, as well as conducting its own training aimed at ensuring end-use restrictions are observed.

¶5. (C) Tantawi said he understood the message, though it is not possible to say there will never be another violation. Ambassador stressed to him again the importance of instituting vigorous and transparent procedures to minimize the possibility that this happens. Scobey
