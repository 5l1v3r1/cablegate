¶2.  (SBU) Text of Arab League Moussa's February 7 Letter to 
the Secretary: 
 
League of Arab States 
The Secretary General 
 
Cairo, February 7, 2007 
Unofficial Translation 
 
Excellency, 
 
Let me at the outset express my appreciation for the 
important cultural and historical role played by your 
country, as a member of the World Heritage Committee in 
charge of preserving this heritage all over the world. 
 
In this context, I would like to draw your attention to an 
issue regarding the preservation of the cultural heritage in 
Palestine.  The Arab Ministers of Culture have categorically 
rejected the inclusion by Israel of Jerusalem as an Israeli 
site on the World Heritage List which represents a defiance 
of international law and resolutions of international 
legitimacy, including the World Heritage Convention.  The 
Arab Ministers of Culture have issued a communique in this 
regard that has been transmitted earlier to you by the 
Director General of ALECSO (The Arab League Educational, 
Cultural and Scientific Organization). 
 
As you know, the Security Council has affirmed in several 
resolutions (No. 252/1968, 267/1969, 298/1971, 446/1979, 
452/1979, 465/1980, 476/1980, 478/1980, 605/1987) that 
Israel's attempts to change the legal and demographic status 
of East Jerusalem are illegitimate.  The General Assembly 
also adopted similar resolutions, confirming that East 
Jerusalem is an occupied territory and that, consequently, 
Israel is considered an occupying power. 
 
The inclusion of East Jerusalem on the heritage list by 
Israel, an occupying power, represents a flagrant violation 
of Israel's legal obligations in accordance with 
international law, as well as with both Security Council and 
General Assembly resolutions. 
 
The World Heritage Committee will hold its next meeting in 
New Zealand on June 23, 2007 to discuss this matter. 
Therefore, I address this message to you with the request 
that the Committee would help ensure that principles of 
international law are upheld and that the Committee would not 
approve the inclusion of Jerusalem on Israel's preliminary 
heritage list, in compliance with the fact that East 
Jerusalem is an occupied city. 
 
I am confident that Your Excellency understands the intricate 
and sensitive situation concerning Jerusalem to the Arab, 
Muslim, and Christian worlds, and therefore understands the 
demand to exclude Jerusalem from the Israeli preliminary 
list.  I have addressed a message in this regard to the 
Director General of UNESCO requesting him to bring the matter 
to the attention of the World Heritage Committee. 
 
Sincerely, 
/s/ 
Amre Moussa
