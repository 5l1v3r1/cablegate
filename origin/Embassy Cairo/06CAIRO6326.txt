¶1. (U) On October 10, World Health Organization (WHO) officials in 
Cairo confirmed the first case of H5N1 Avian influenza in a human 
since May, bringing the total number of human cases this year to 
fifteen, six of which were fatal.  According to WHO statistics, 
Egypt has had the second highest number of AI outbreaks in humans in 
the world this year.  Indonesia, the highest, has reported 50 cases 
and 40 fatalities. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The 39 year old infected woman from Gharbiya, north of 
Cairo, reportedly slaughtered her infected flock of ducks in her 
home after two died, and shortly after began running a high fever. 
She has been hospitalized and treated with Tamiflu.  The Central 
Public Health Labs, a division of the Ministry of Health and 
Population (MOHP) trained by Cairo's NAMRU-3, tested the newest 
patient and determined she was positive for H5N1.  They also passed 
along a specimen to NAMRU for confirmation and sequence to determine 
if the most recent strain is the same as the one analyzed earlier 
this year, or if it is another strain. 
 
¶3.  (U) BACKGROUND:  As reported in reftel, H5N1 began appearing in 
poultry in September, after a lull in the number of cases over the 
summer.  The GOE has been systematically vaccinating birds on large 
commercial farms, but the preponderance of backyard and rooftop 
poultry farms, especially in rural parts of the country, is still an 
issue.
