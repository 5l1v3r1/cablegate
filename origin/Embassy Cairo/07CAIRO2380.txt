Ahmed Abdel Latif, of the MFA Office of the Assistant 
Minister for Multilateral Relations, told poloff on August 2 
that Ambassador Naela Gabr will most likely head the Egyptian 
delegation to the second NPT preperatory committee in spring 
2008, but that Egyptian representation will not be decided 
until a few months beforehand.  Abdel Latif comfirmed that 
Ambassador Ehab Fawzy is Egypt's incoming representative to 
the IAEA, and as such he will most likely attend the 
September IAEA meetings; however, Abdel Latif said that the 
composition of the Egyptian delegation has not yet been set.
