SUBJECT: ASSISTANT MINISTER OF DEFENSE REJECTS US OFFER OF 
BORDER SECURITY ASSESSMENT 
 
Classified by DCM Stuart Jones for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (C)  The OMC Chief asked the Assistant Minister of 
Defense for Policy MG Mohammed Al Assar and the Assistant 
Minister for Armament MG Fouad Abd el Halim on May 21 if 
Egypt is prepared to proceed with the US proposal to use FMF 
to fund a border security assessment.  MG Al Assar said Egypt 
rejects the proposal.  He said Egypt's Border Guard Forces 
are well-trained and well-equipped, and MoD does not want to 
divert attention or FMF money away from its own national 
priorities to a border security initiative.  Bolstering the 
750 troops (Border Guard Forces) on the border with Gaza 
would, he explained, address the problems there. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Comment:  Al Assar's reaction is no surprise.  We 
have a game plan to press the case with Tantawi directly 
after lining up what support we might find among other MoD 
players, in MFA, and in EGIS.  The call ultimately will be 
Mubarak's.
