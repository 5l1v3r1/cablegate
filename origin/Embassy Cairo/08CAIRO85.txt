Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) On December 31, 2007, Minister of Defense Field 
Marshal Mohamed Tantawi told the Ambassador and visiting 
CODEL Voinovich that conditioning U.S. military assistance to 
Egypt would harm bilateral relations, and would not be 
understood by members of military or the average Egyptian. 
Egypt has been committed to peace with Israel for 28 years, 
yet Israel seems bent on harming not only its relationship 
with Egypt, but Egypt's relationship with the United States. 
Senator Voinovich expressed his hope that Secretary Rice will 
waive conditions on Egypt's FMF, allowing U.S. military 
assistance to Egypt to be fully funded.  End summary.

Conditioning Military Assistance 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) During their hour-long meeting on December 31, DefMin 
Tantawi told the Ambassador and visiting CODEL Voinovich 
(Senator Voinovich, R-OH; Rep. Turner, R-OH; Rep. Pearce, 
R-NM; Rep. Bishop, R-UT; Rep. Gingrey, R-GA) that 
conditioning Egypt's FMF assistance will harm bilateral 
relations and would be rejected not only by Egypt's military 
members, but by all Egyptians.  "This (conditioning) is bad 
for U.S.-Egyptian relations."  The average Egyptian sees such 
conditioning of military aid as U.S. interference in Egypt's 
internal affairs, Tantawi said. 
 
¶3. (C) Senator Voinovich said that he understood Tantawi's 
concern, and stressed that the conditioning can be waived by 
the Secretary of State; "I hope this can be worked out." 
Unfortunately, Voinovich said, there are certain members of 
Congress who do not consider all the ramifications of the 
U.S.-Egypt relationship.  "They don't see the big picture." 
Turning to the issue of tunneling and smuggling under Egypt's 
border with Gaza, Voinovich opined that "the sooner we solve 
that problem, the better for our relationship." 
 
----------------- 
"Not About Money" 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Tantawi stressed that "the issue is not about money." 
The issue is about shared strategic interests, he said. 
Egypt has been committed to peace with Israel for 28 years. 
Egypt has obeyed the peace treaty consistently and to the 
letter, he added, "but Israel breaks it every day." Egypt 
understands that the United States and Israel have a special 
relationship.  "We know your relations with Israel are very 
important, but that should not affect your relationship with 
us."  We have shared important interests in this region, 
Tantawi said.  We are committed to having good relations with 
both the U.S. and Israel, but "every time Israel goes to 
Congress in Washington it accuses Egypt" and tries to harm 
relations with the U.S.

Iraq 
---- 
 
¶5. (C) Turning to Iraq, Senator Voinovich asked if the U.S. 
should withdraw its troops.  "You must do it in stages," 
Tantawi replied.  "Not all at once."  America must be 
prepared to stay in Iraq, "perhaps for a long time." 
 
---- 
Iran 
---- 
 
¶6. (C) On Iran, Tantawi said that Egypt "rejects completely" 
the expansion of Iranian influence in the region.  "We see 
this (Iranian influence) as a direct threat to Egyptian 
national security."  However, Tantawi added, we believe that 
differences with Iran must be solved "peacefully, and not 
militarily."  We must do all we can to curb Iranian expansion 
wherever it occurs, whether in Iraq, Syria, or Lebanon.  "We 
hope to see the entire Middle East as a WMD-free zone." 
 
¶7. (C) Senator Voinovich asked if the Saudis saw Iran in the 
same way, and if they communicated their concerns directly to 
the Iranians.  Tantawi said that the Saudis try to be 
helpful.  "We and the Saudis are close," he said.  "We share 
views and have the same attitudes." 
 
¶8. (U) CODEL Voinovich did not clear this message.
