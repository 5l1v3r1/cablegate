Â¶1. (C) On July 19, we delivered reftel demarche to Deputy Assistant Foreign Minister and Coordinator for Counterterrorism Ashraf Mohsen. Mohsen was not familiar with the Regional Biometrics Partnership Conference and said the MFA had not received a conference invitation. He suggested that the invitation may have been sent to Egypt's Ministry of Justice or Interior. Mohsen asked that we follow-up with the Jordanian Government. Based on the description of the conference we provided, Mohsen believes the GoE would be interested in attending. Tueller
