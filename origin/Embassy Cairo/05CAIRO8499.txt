     ¶C. STATE 153120 
     ¶D. CAIRO 05923 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS TO THE OVERALL 
SECURITY SITUATION IN EGYPT, POST RECOMMENDS THAT THE AUGUST 
18, 2005 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT (PA) BE ALLOWED TO EXPIRE ON 
NOVEMBER 15, AND THAT NO NEW PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT BE ISSUED. 
THE RECENTLY UPDATED LANGUAGE OF THE EGYPT CONSULAR 
INFORMATION SHEET (CIS) REFLECTS THE INCIDENTS THAT 
PRECIPITATED THE PA AND ADVISES TRAVELERS TO EGYPT TO 
EXERCISE CAUTION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) CAIRO'S EMERGENCY ACTION COMMITTEE (EAC) HAS 
REVIEWED EGYPT'S SECURITY ENVIRONMENT IN ITS LAST THREE 
MEETINGS, WITH SPECIAL FOCUS ON THE CURRENT SITUATION IN THE 
SINAI.  AT THE OCTOBER 17 FULL EAC (REF. A), THERE WAS 
UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT THAT THE PA OF AUGUST 18 (REF. C) BE 
ALLOWED TO EXPIRE, AND THAT AN UPDATED CIS PROVIDE THE 
PUBLIC WITH INFORMATION NECESSARY TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT 
TRAVEL TO THE SINAI. 
 
¶3. (SBU) THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS 
IN THE SINAI SINCE THE TERRORIST BOMBINGS AT THE SOUTH SINAI 
RESORT OF SHARM EL SHEIKH ON JULY 23 THAT PROMPTED THE 
PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT.  THE EGYPTIAN INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
OCTOBER 2004 TABA/NUWEIBA AND JULY 2005 SHARM EL SHEIKH 
BOMBINGS HAS YIELDED SEVERAL SUSPECTS (SOME OF WHOM ARE ON 
TRIAL NOW) AND HAS RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF OTHERS IN 
SHOOTOUTS.  AS OF NOVEMBER 2005, A SMALL BAND OF SUSPECTS IS 
STILL HOLED UP IN THE JABEL HALAL REGION, A MOUNTAINOUS AREA 
IN NE SINAI.  THE GOE HAS SURROUNDED THE MASSIF.  RECENTLY, 
THE GOE HAS GREATLY INCREASED SECURITY IN THE SINAI, 
ERECTING ROADBLOCKS INTO MAJOR TOURIST AREAS, AND STATIONING 
EXPLOSIVE DETECTING DOGS AT THE TUNNEL UNDER THE SINAI 
CANAL, THE MAIN TRANSIT POINT INTO THE SINAI FROM CAIRO. 
 
¶4. (SBU) FINALLY, THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS TAKEN ACTION TO 
INCREASE SECURITY OF THEIR BUSINESSES IN THE TOURIST AREAS 
OF THE SINAI.  FOR EXAMPLE, AT TABA HEIGHTS, LOCATION OF 
SEVERAL MAJOR TOURIST HOTELS, ALL VEHICLES ARE CHECKED ON 
THE ACCESS ROAD ALMOST A MILE BEFORE THE RESORTS.  EACH 
HOTEL ALSO HAS A SECONDARY CHECK BEFORE ITS OWN PROPERTY. 
IN SHARM, BOLLARDS, GATES, AND OTHER PHYSICAL BARRIERS BLOCK 
ALMOST EVERY DRIVEWAY FROM THE MAIN ROAD.  IN ADDITION, 
BERMS, TRENCHES, AND OTHER PHYSICAL BARRIERS ARE BEING 
ERECTED IN THE DESERT TO THWART WOULD-BE BOMBERS. 
 
¶5. (SBU) WHILE THE AFOREMENTIONED MEASURES ARE NOT 
FOOLPROOF, THE CONSENSUS OF THE EAC IS THAT -- IN THE 
ABSENCE OF ANY SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE INDICATING PLANNING FOR 
AN ATTACK IN THE SINAI -- THE REVISED LANGUAGE OF THE CIS 
COUPLED WITH THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA PUBLIC 
ANNOUNCEMENT PROVIDES AMPLE INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC.  THE 
REVISED CIS DROPS THE ADMONITION THAT TRAVELERS "AVOID" THE 
SINAI, AND INSTEAD URGES THAT THEY "EXERCISE CAUTION" SHOULD 
THEY CHOOSE TO TRAVEL THERE OR ANY OTHER LOCATION IN EGYPT. 
 
¶6. (SBU) THE EAC WILL REMAINED SEIZED WITH THE SECURITY 
SITUATION IN EGYPT -- ESPECIALLY THE SINAI.
