¶4.    (U) On August 12, following up on President Obama,s 
Cairo speech, the Ambassador hosted a lunch with key Egyptian 
religious leaders.   Guests remarked that President Obama 
does not depict Islam as a problem.  Several noted President 
Obama,s readiness to highlight the positive contribution of 
individuals from the Islamic world.  Guests remarked on the 
change of tone towards the Islamic community.  The majority 
of guests cited this change in tone as the most important 
outcome of President Obama,s speech. 
 
¶5.    (U) Participants suggested a number of ideas to promote 
dialogue between the US and the worldwide Muslim community. 
Some suggestions were very local in nature and could be 
implemented immediately, such as expanding the "English for 
Imams" program (managed by Embassy Cairo).  Guests also 
expressed  interest in expanded student exchange programs. 
Others ideas were more complex, such as the request to 
address a perceived bias against Islam in U.S. schools. 
 
¶6.    (U) The most strident discussion surrounded the 
worldwide Muslim community,s desire for a solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Several guests spoke 
passionately about the need for the U.S. to commit to 
effectively addressing the conflict.  The perceived need for 
"justice" for the Palestinian people was presented as an 
essential condition for both regional stability and 
restoration of America's standing in the eyes of the 
worldwide Muslim community.  Several suggested that 
meaningful engagement will be difficult absent a 
comprehensive Middle East peace.
