SUBJECT: ANDORRA ELECTS ITS MAYORS 
 
¶1. (SBU) The ruling Liberal Party of Andorra (LP) continued its 
winning ways December 2 handily winning weekend municipal 
elections. The Social Democratic Party (PS), which had formed a 
coalition with other like minded groups under the name 
L'Alternativa, came in second. Two big surprises were the 
victorious showings of two LP splinter parties, Union of the 
People (Unio del Poble-UdP), and Municipal Action of Ordino 
(Accio Comunal d'Ordino-ACO), which also drew support from the 
nearly defunct Democratic Center Party (CDS). A coalition of 
Greens, running for the first time, obtained a healthy ten 
percent of the votes in several municipalities. Lower voter 
turnout was a factor in these elections. 
¶2. (SBU) Seventy-eight percent of the 19.300 eligible voters 
(about 24 percent of the population) participated in electing 
the 84 councilors of Andorra's seven municipalities (Andorra la 
Vella, Canillo, Encamp, Escaldes-Engordany, La Massana, Ordino, 
and Sant Julia de Loria). Voter turnout was lower, however, than 
four years ago, when over 80 percent of the population took part 
in the elections. 
¶3. (SBU) Although the LP continued its hold on power, 
abstentions and splintering ate away at its electoral 
superiority. It LP lost control of two of the five 
municipalities in which it held sway. The LP will govern in La 
Massana, Sant Julia de Loria and Canillo. The PS-L'Alternativa 
will control over Encamp and Andorra la Vella), while upstart 
UdP will govern Escaldes-Engordany and ACO will control Ordino. 
¶4. (SBU) The 19 parties or groups up for election campaigned 
principally on issues of local concern: the environment, 
development of public land, immigration and job quotas for 
immigrants, housing (particularly for the aged), and public 
transportation. These same issues are likely to be key in the 
next general elections schedule for Spring 2009. 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: President Pintat's Liberal Party continues to 
be the most attractive to the majority of Andorrans, but that 
attraction is fading. Falling voter turnout, internal party 
discord, manifested by more splinter parties, and opposition 
coalitions are eating away at the LP's strong position. The 
PS-L'Alternativa coalition, for example, saw its position grow 
stronger in these elections, and the Greens made a statement for 
the first time in Andorran elections. All of this will bear 
watching in the run up to the general elections in 2009. END 
COMMENT.
