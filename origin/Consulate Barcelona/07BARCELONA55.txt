OPPOSITION LEADER 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: CG traveled to Andorra July 26 to call on 
newly appointed Foreign Minister Meritxell Mateu, meet for the 
first time with opposition party leader Jaume Bartomeu, 
President of the Social Democrat group in the Andorran 
Parliament, and handle an ACS case.  Mateu delivered a copy of a 
diplomatic note (faxed to EUR/WE) requesting agrement for Carles 
Font, Andorra's Ambassador-designate to the U.S.  Mateu and 
Bartomeu highlighted the close cooperation between the United 
States and Andorra at the UN and in other international fora, 
and both sought to reaffirm their commitment to continued 
cooperation.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Meritxell Mateu, 41, swapped portfolios with former 
FM Juli Minoves in May after a cabinet shakeup.  She told CG one 
of her priorities would be to bring Andorra closer in line with 
the world's financial transaction and banking regimes and rid 
the country of its reputation as a tax haven.  She assured the 
CG that Andorra has ratified all UN anti-terrorism conventions. 
She will travel to New York with Head of Government (prime 
minister equivalent) Albert Pintat to attend the UNGA as well as 
special high-level Conference on climate change ahead of the GA. 
 In that regard, she expressed appreciation for our note to the 
Government of Andorra with President Bush's remarks on the 
administrations new International Framework Initiative.  She 
said Andorra would continue to follow the debate on UN reform, 
and is likely to send a representative to the ICAO GA in 
Montreal, September 18-28.  She admitted that work still needed 
to be done on Andorra's CWC/BWC commitments.  Finally, Mateu 
left CG with a copy of a diplomatic note she will be sending 
shortly requesting agrement for Carles Font, Andorra's choice 
for U.S. ambassador. 
 
¶3. (U) In her previous position, Minister for Urban Development, 
Higher Education, and Research Mateu handled the Fulbright 
program for Andorra.  She was Ambassador to Slovenia (2001), 
Ambassador to Germany (1999-2004), Ambassador to Denmark (1999), 
Ambassador to the Netherlands (1998), Ambassador to the EU, 
Belgium, and Luxembourg (1997), and Ambassador to France and 
Permrep at UNESCO from 1995-97. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Prior to meeting FM Mateu, CG called on Jaume 
Bartomeu, President of the Social Democratic party and chief 
rival to Pintat's Liberal Party.  Bartomeu worried that the 
current government was not moving fast enough to address three 
issues: 1) bringing the country in line with international 
anti-money laundering standards; 2) clarifying social rights for 
non-citizens of Andorra, and 3) establishing a smoother 
relationship with the EU.  He expressed appreciation for the 
excellent relationship between Andorra and the U.S. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  The Andorrans are proud of their close 
relationship with the United States and clearly want to maintain 
it.  Their effort to ratify the UN Terrorism Conventions is a 
direct outcome of our exchanges on the issue.  Likewise, there 
may be more we could do with them to make their banking system 
more transparent and less susceptible to criminal activity. 
Currently, the Andorran banking system remains secretive, and 
there is a clear sense that government and opposition leaders 
are worried about the sources of money that might be flowing 
through it.  Both main parties want to take the high ground 
without giving their rival an advantage on this issue.  End 
Comment.
