¶1.  (SBU) Economic-Political Counselor and Political Unit 
Chief discussed ref (A) information on May 23 with Austrian 
MFA A/S-equivalent for Africa and the Middle East Ralph 
Scheide and Director for Gulf Affairs Oskar Wuestinger. 
Scheide observed that the U.S. and EU now appeared to have a 
"complete identity of objectives" for Iraq as well as in 
their aims for the U.S.-EU International Conference in 
Brussels.  Scheide hoped that the conference would have a 
significant "impact on the situation on the ground" in Iraq. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Scheide thought the conference should serve to 
highlight the EU's preparedness to help.  He noted that 
Austria had offered to provide assistance in drafting Iraq's 
new constitution, in particular its expertise in addressing 
questions of federalism and multi-ethnic "standards." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Scheide offered to inform us of the composition and 
leadership of the Austrian representatives for the conference 
as soon as those arrangements have been finalized. 
Wuestinger added that he was engaged in the run-up to the 
PrepComm meeting.  We said that we were expecting additional 
information about the PrepComm (ref B) and agreed to get back 
in touch  to discuss both the organizational and substantive 
aspects further.
