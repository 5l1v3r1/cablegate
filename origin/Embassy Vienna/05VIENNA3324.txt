(SBU) Embassy Vienna conveyed reftel points to 
PDAS-equivalent for the former Soviet Union Josef Litschauer 
on October 3 and followed up on October 5 with A/S-equivalent 
for Disarmament Dorothea Auer.  Auer thanked us for the 
information and inquired further about the background of the 
problem.  We clarified the status of the project based on the 
information in paras 1-3 of reftel.  We asked that MFA 
instruct the Austrian Embassy to weigh in with the GOU to 
expedite final approval of the Implementing Agreement.
