Polchief discussed reftel A points March 3 with Georg Diwald, 
MFA Deputy Director for International organizations.  Diwald 
said the GOA maintains its opposition to an Article 16 
deferral of the arrest warrant for President Bashir (reftel 
B).  Diwald said the GOA would not necessarily oppose a UNSC 
press statement following the issuance of an arrest warrant, 
but he agreed it would be unlikely that Council members could 
agree on a text.
