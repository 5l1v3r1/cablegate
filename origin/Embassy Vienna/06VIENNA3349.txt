¶1.  (SBU) EconPolCouns delivered reftel demarche on November 
17 to Peter Huber, the acting A/S-equivalent UN Affairs head 
at the Austrian MFA. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Huber noted that EU countries had split in their 
votes on the issue in the UN Security Council, with France 
and Greece voting "yes" and the UK, Denmark and Slovakia 
abstaining.  He said EU UN Ambassadors were meeting as we 
spoke (0900 EDT), and would try to hammer out a consensus 
position.  He said that if there were a consensus, it would 
most likely be for an abstention.  However, if there were no 
consensus, some EU member states would vote "yes" and some 
would abstain -- there would probably be no "no" votes.  In 
the event of a split, Austria would vote with the larger bloc 
of EU countries.
