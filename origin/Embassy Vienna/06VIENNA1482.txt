BEGIN TEXT 
 
Declaration by the Presidency on behalf of the European Union 
regarding the recent arrests in Syria 
 
Recalling the Presidency's statement of 19th January, the 
European Union expresses regret that the positive steps taken 
in January 2006 regarding the human rights situation in Syria 
have not been continued.  On the contrary, the situation has 
substantially deteriorated.  The EU expresses its deep 
concern about the recent widespread harassment of human 
rights defenders, their families and peaceful political 
activists, in particular arbitrary arrests and repeated 
incommunicado detention.  The European Union calls on the 
Syrian government to fully respect freedom of expression and 
assembly as laid down in the Syrian Constitution and in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ratified 
by Syria in 1969, which should be fully in force in light of 
the recent limitation of the emergency law to matters 
strictly concerning state security. 
 
The European Union urges the Syrian authorities to reconsider 
all cases of political prisoners and immediately release all 
prisoners of conscience.
