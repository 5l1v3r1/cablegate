¶1.  On October 24, Charge delivered reftel points to Johannes 
Kyrle, the Austrian Foreign Ministry's Secretary General and 
acting deputy Foreign Minister. 
 
¶2.  Kyrle recalled that Austria had made a generous pledge at 
the Madrid Iraq conference in October 2003, and said the 
Austrian cabinet would have to consider Austria's 
participation in the Foundation for the Future.  He would 
ensure that the matter was brought to the attention of the 
cabinet expeditiously but he could not foresee how fast the 
government would take a decision.  The Austrians would 
appreciate updates on the donor list.  MFA Middle East 
Director Ralph Scheide said the Austrian Ambassador to Kuwait 
(accredited to Bahrain) would likely attend the Bahrain 
conference as an observer.  Scheide said he would like to 
discuss the issue further with the U.S. attendee at the 
upcoming conference on "Islam in a Pluralistic World," which 
Austria will host in Vienna November 14-16.
