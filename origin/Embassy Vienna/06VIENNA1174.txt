(SBU)  EconPolOff conveyed reftel points on April 21 to 
Helmut Boeck, the head of the MFA's International 
Organizations Bureau.  Boeck said that the GoA appreciated 
the difficulties experienced during the parliamentary 
elections and the need for additional financial resources. 
However, it was unlikely that Austria would be able to 
contribute funds to cover the financial shortfall.  Boeck 
said he would verify this with his colleagues in the Asian 
Bureau.
