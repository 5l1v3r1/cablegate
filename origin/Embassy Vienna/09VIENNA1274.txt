Polchief discussed reftel points October 6 with Ronald Sturm, 
MFA Unit Chief for IAEA, CTBTO Prep Com and NPT.  Sturm said 
the GOA shares U.S. concerns about the enrichment facility 
near Qom.  He stressed the importance of having the IAEA 
inspect the facility as soon as possible, and said the GOA is 
encouraged that the Government of Iran has reportedly agreed 
to an inspection.  He shared Polchief's view that Iran must 
demonstrate goodwill by following through on both the 
inspection and the planned transfer of low enriched uranium 
to Russia for processing.
