Polchief discussed reftel points December 16 with Wolfgang 
Lapuh, MFA Deputy Director for the Middle East and Africa. 
Lapuh said the GOA will pledge 50,000 euros per year in 
bilateral support for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon from 
2009 through 2011.  He acknowledged that this amount was less 
than what the GOA had earlier indicated it would contribute. 
He said the contribution was cut as part of a broader 
budgetary belt tightening.
