¶1.  Please see action request para. 4. 
 
¶2.  In a March 21 meeting, Austrian Interior Minister 
Guenther Platter told Ambassador that the GOA is sympathetic 
to the notion of continuing the deployment of Austrian 
trainers at the Jordan International Police Training Center 
(JIPTC).  There are no immediate plans to withdraw the two 
trainers who remain.  However, Platter said he would 
appreciate more information on our current thinking regarding 
how long we would continue to need the trainers. 
 
¶3.  In a separate communication on March 22, Brigadier Kurt 
Hager, who manages the international police training missions 
for the Interior Ministry, reiterated that the two trainers 
remain at JIPTC "in order to participate further in the 
current management course as trainers."  However, he 
requested "information from the U.S. side on further plans" 
in order to make a determination concerning an extension of 
the trainers' participation. 
 
¶4.  Action request:  We would appreciate guidance concerning 
the further duration of training at the JIPTC and 
expectations of the need for the continued presence of the 
Austrian trainers.
