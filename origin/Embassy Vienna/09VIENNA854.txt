REF: STATE 70576 
 
Econ/Pol Counselor delivered reftel message to Austrian MFA 
Director for Eastern European Affairs, Franz-Josef Kuglitsch, 
on July 13.  Kuglitsch, who had independently familiarized 
himself with USG website postings on the Summit, had no 
substantive comment.  He did report that the Austrian Embassy 
in Moscow had been told at the Russian MFA that the GoR was 
satisfied with the outcome of the Summit.  The Russians 
asserted, as a particular success, that Article V of the 
Joint Understanding on START follow-on negotiations 
establishes an (indeterminate) link between missile defense 
and START follow-on.
