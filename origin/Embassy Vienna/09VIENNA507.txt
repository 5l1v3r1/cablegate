Polchief and Winnie Teunissen, second secretary at the Dutch 
Embassy in Vienna, raised reftel points April 21 with Andreas 
Launer, MFA Unit Chief for IAEA, CTBTO Prep Com, and NPT, and 
provided Launer with a copy of reftel draft agenda.  Launer 
responded April 23 that the GOA would be represented at the 
GICNT Plenary in June, most likely by Alexander Marschik, MFA 
Director for Disarmament, Arms Control, and 
Non-Proliferation, although no final decision had been made 
on who would attend.  Launer said he did not believe the GOA 
would make any presentations during the working group 
sessions, but would likely want to make a statement at the 
plenary.  He said MFA officials are discussing with relevant 
GOA authorities the possibility of conducting GICNT seminars 
or activities.
