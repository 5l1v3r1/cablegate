 Poloff discussed reftel points January 9 with Gerd Biwald, 
MFA Deputy Director for International Organizations.  Biwald 
said EU member states had discussed Iran's candidacy for the 
UNDP Presidency.  He said that while Austria understood USG 
concerns about Iran's candidacy, Austria in principle 
supports a candidate endorsed by its sponsoring region. 
Since the GOA would expect other countries to respect this 
principle regarding an Austrian candidacy, Austria is likely 
to vote in Iran's favor, he said.
