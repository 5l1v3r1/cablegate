¶1.  EconPolCouns delivered reftel demarche on February 15 to 
Peter Huber, the Austrian MFA's deputy Director for 
International Organizations Affairs, and Ralph Scheide, the 
MFA's Middle East and Africa Director. 
 
¶2.  Huber said Austria considered the UN role in Iraq to be 
an important one.  Huber said he would favor participation in 
funding the Distinct Entity Trust Fund.  However, he said it 
would be extremely difficult for Austria to make such funds 
available. 
 
¶3.  Huber explained that the Austrian Finance Ministry, which 
has authority over budgetting, would only provide funds to 
the Foreign Ministry for its "legal obligations" to the UN. 
These included funds for the peacekeeping budget and for the 
regular budget.  The Finance Ministry would not agree to 
provide funds  to the Foreign Ministry for discretionary 
spending, which included voluntary contributions such as 
those for the Distinct Entity Trust Fund.  In addition, the 
new Austrian government has not yet concluded its biennial 
budget, and there are currently no funds for new spending 
initiatives.
