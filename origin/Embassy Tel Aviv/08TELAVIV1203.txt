Most media led with Sen. Barak Obama's address to AIPAC yesterday. 
The media characterized it as powerfully "Zionist" and highlighted 
his assurances that he would not allow Iran to acquire nuclear arms, 
and that Jerusalem would remain the undivided capital of Israel. 
Media noted that this latter comment drew fire from Palestinian 
President Mahmoud Abbas.  PM Ehud Olmert was quoted as saying by 
Ha'aretz that he did not hear the speech himself, but that "from 
what I heard they [the presidential candidates] had impressive 
performances and I am very impressed by these declarations. I will 
speak with all of them by phone."  Ha'aretz bannered: "Obama to 
AIPAC: Committed to Defending Israel from Any Threat"; Maariv 
bannered Obama's "embrace" of Israel; Yediot highlighted Obama's 
remark about Israel's security being "sacrosanct"; Israel Hayom 
bannered: "Obama's Surprise: In Favor of United Jerusalem." 
 
All media reported that PM Ehud Olmert met yesterday with President 
Bush in Washington, with Iran at the center of the discussion. 
Ha'aretz and The Jerusalem Post reported that Olmert told reporters 
that the two leaders also discussed the progress of talks with the 
Palestinians and the situation in Lebanon. President Bush asked to 
be briefed on developments with Syria. Leading media quoted Olmert 
as saying: "Every day that goes by we are making significant steps 
in dealing with this problem [Iran].  We, with the world under 
American leadership, are dealing with it in an effort to reach the 
goal which is to prevent Iran from acquiring [nuclear] armsI do not 
think it is appropriate for Iran to know what we are doing."  Israel 
Radio quoted the PM as saying that the question marks hovering the 
 
Iranian nuclear program -- regarding time and determination 
constraints -- are lessening.  Maariv reported that Senator Hillary 
Clinton and Senator Obama will not meet with Olmert due to 
conflicting schedules. 
 
Maariv, Israel Radio and The Jerusalem Post reported that today in 
Tel Aviv Defense Minister Ehud Barak will meet with Director of 
National Intelligence Mike McConnell.  Iran will be at the center of 
their talks.  Maariv reported that Mossad
