SUBJECT: IRISL OBJECTIVES SHARED WITH GOI 
 
REF: A. STATE 104496 
     ¶B. TEL AVIV 1411 
 
¶1. On September 10, Econoff transmitted Treasury's press 
release on the designation of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
Shipping Lines (IRISL) to a representative of Udi Levi, 
Director of the National Security Council's (NSC) Bureau of 
Counterterrorism Finance.  The press release was also 
transmitted to Israeli Defense Intelligence (IDI), the 
Israeli Security Agency (ISA), and the Deputy Director for 
Counterterroism at the MFA, Ariel Shafransky. 
 
¶2. Since Israel does not maintain diplomatic or commercial 
relations with Iran, it does not recieve any Iranian ships in 
its ports or territorial waters.  The GOI is highly 
supportive of any measure to thwart Iranian shipping 
activities, however, and it joins the US in lobbying the 
international community to act in this regard. 
 
¶3. Still lacking a procedure to designate entities acting 
outside of Israel, the GOI is unable to incorporate IRISL 
into its own regime (see reftel "B").  Due to the GOI's 
transitional state, Econ contacts at the NSC anticipate 
further delays in Knesset approval of the new procedure 
developed by the NSC.  Updates will be forthcoming as 
information is provided to Post.
