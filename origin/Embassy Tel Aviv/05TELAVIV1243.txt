-- Palestinian Authority (PA) Interior Minister Nasir Yusif 
replaced all the PA security chiefs and deputies in Jenin 
during a March 1 visit to inspect the overall security 
situation in the city.  The dismissals followed a 
confrontation that included a brief exchange of gunfire 
between members of the al-Aqsa Martyrs, Brigades in Jenin 
and PA security officers.  Al-Aqsa reportedly objected to 
Yusif,s visit to Jenin because the Interior Minister had 
failed to coordinate the visit with the local al-Aqsa 
commander, Zakaria Zubaydah.  Yusif and Zubaydah later held 
private discussions, after which Zubaydah expressed his 
support for the Interior Minister and his efforts to bring 
security to the city.

reports that he is planning to travel to Syria to meet with
