REF: STATE 116599 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) MCPO 
confirmed the Israeli MOD's continued possession of two Gen 
III FOM 1600 "Astroscope" image intensifiers during an 
inspection on December 16.  The two Astroscope image 
intensifiers (serial numbers 40992 and 41016) are stored at 
an IDF facility in Herzliya (approximately 15 kilometers 
north of Tel Aviv).  The image intensifiers are stored within 
a vault in a secure room accessible by a magnetic card swipe 
and authorized fingerprint pad.  The facility unit commander 
possesses the key to the vault; the commander must approve 
any use of the image intensifiers.  Facility officers noted 
that the equipment is visually checked daily; a corresponding 
weekly report confirming these daily inspections is forwarded 
to the IDF chain of command.  Facility officers claimed the 
image intensifiers are being used only for the purpose stated 
on the export license.  Kobi Fogler from the MOD's 
Directorate of Security Defense Establishment (MALMAB) also 
was present during the inspection.
