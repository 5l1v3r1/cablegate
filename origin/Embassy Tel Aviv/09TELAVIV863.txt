SUBJECT: ISRAEL PROPOSES TO HOST GICNT WORKSHOP IN NOVEMBER 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The GOI has proposed hosting an 
expert-level Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism 
(GICNT) workshop in November focusing on legal aspects and 
forensics issues related to combating nuclear and 
radiological terrorism.  According to MFA Director for Arms 
Control Rodica Radian-Gordon, the GOI is seeking approval 
from Washington and Moscow as the GICNT co-chairs, as well as 
possible names of U.S. and Russian experts who might be 
willing to present on the workshop's focus.  The GOI hopes to 
receive an answer regarding the feasibility of the workshop 
from the co-chairs prior to the GICNT Plenary in June. 
Radian-Gordon discussed these issues with polmiloff on April 
¶16.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Radian-Gordon briefed Russian Embassy Counselor 
Yuri Rudakov and polmiloff on the proposed Israeli GICNT 
workshop on April 16.  Other GOI interlocutors included 
Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) Deputy Director for 
External Relations Ronen Shaul and MFA Arms Control Advisor 
Israel Tikochinski. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Radian-Gordon passed a workshop proposal paper to 
polmiloff (para 5), explaining that the GOI is seeking to 
avoid redundancy with previous GICNT workshops by bringing 
"something new to the table."  She added the GOI hopes to 
hear whether Washington and Moscow as the GICNT co-chairs 
find the workshop feasible prior to the GICNT Plenary in 
June, so that the GOI can begin planning the workshop in 
earnest. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Shaul noted the GOI envisions a working-level, 
experts meeting bringing nuclear and legal technical 
expertise from capitals.  He added that the GOI hopes the USG 
and the Russian Federation can provide experts to not only 
participate in the workshop, but also present and lead 
discussions on the topics outlined in section 7 of the 
workshop proposal paper.  Shaul noted that the Head of 
Forensics for the Israeli Police has already agreed to 
participate in the workshop, and recommended one of his U.S. 
counterparts -- Pat Grant from the Forensic Science Center at 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory -- as an ideal 
workshop participant and briefer.
