INTO FORCE 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) On December 31, Israeli MFA Export Control 
Department Director Haim Waxman informed poloff that that the 
Knesset had just passed the implementing regulations for 
Israel's new Defense Export Control Act (DECA), a law 
enhancing Israel's export control system that was passed on 
July 17.  Waxman said that the implementing regulations 
include various control lists (which identify which exports 
require export licenses), the procedures on how to apply for 
export licenses, and how to appeal refusals.  The regulations 
also reportedly detail exemptions from export licenses, and 
procedures by which Israel's MOD coordinates with the MFA on 
export licensing.  Waxman estimated that there were between 
10-13 control orders (the equivalent of our executive orders) 
passed by the Knesset. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Waxman clarified that this important step in the 
legislative process does not complete everything that needs 
to be done (e.g., there are still some regulations and 
control orders that need to be finalized pending agreement by 
various elements of Israel's defense industry), and that this 
is an "interim solution."  Nevertheless, Waxman stressed that 
the DECA had entered into force, and that the bulk of the 
implementing regulations had been passed by the deadline set 
(December 31, 2007).  He pointed out that since the DECA's 
passage earlier in the year, Israel's export control system 
has been operating as if the DECA had already entered into 
force. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Embassy is attempting to obtain copies of the 
implementing regulations and will provide them to NEA/IPA at 
Main State.
