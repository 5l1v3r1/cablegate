THIS IS A JOINT MESSAGE FROM EMBASSY TEL AVIV AND CONGEN 
JERUSALEM. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Arafat advisor for human rights and media 
issues Khalil al-Zaben was shot and killed March 2 by unknown 
Palestinian gunmen in Gaza City.  One settler was injured 
March 2 after Palestinians fired a mortar on Neve Dekalim.

West Bank 
--------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) ATTACKS: 
 
-- Death: The IDF March 1 killed one Palestinian in Yatta 
village, south of Hebron.  The incident came as the army 
besieged a house, in which it suspected a terrorist was 
hiding.  When someone ran out of the house, the troops shot 
and killed him.  Press reports indicated that he was not the 
target of the operation.  Later, the army destroyed the house 
and imposed a curfew on the village. 
 
-- Injury: The IDF March 1 injured one Palestinian in Burkha 
village, near Nablus, during clashes that erupted when 
Israeli forces mounted an arrest operation in the village 
that netted three arrests. 
 
-- Injury: Palestinians March 1 injured one Israeli soldier 
in Bayt Ummar when they threw stones at troops patrolling the 
village. 
 
-- Shooting: Palestinian gunmen March 1 mounted two shooting 
attacks near Ramallah that caused no injuries but did damage 
one Israeli car.  Two other shooting incidents the same day, 
one near Homesh and the other near Shaked, likewise caused no 
injuries. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) ARRESTS: 
 
-- The IDF March 1 arrested three Palestinians in Burkha 
village, near Nablus. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) DEMOLITIONS: 
 
-- The IDF March 1 demolished three families, tents in Al 
Khader village, near Bethlehem.  The families had set up the 
tents on the site where their homes had stood until the IDF 
demolished them a few weeks ago.  Reports indicated that the 
demolitions were carried out because the houses (and then 
tents) overlooked Route 60, a road used by settlers.  The 
ostensible reason was a lack of building permits. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) SETTLEMENT EXPANSION/EVACUATION: 
 
-- Palestinians reported March 1 that settlers in Tekoa had 
moved barrels, perhaps for a water supply, to a location 
outside the settlement's boundary.

media issues, early in the morning March 2 in the Sabra 
district of Gaza City.  No group yet has claimed 
responsibility for the attack. 
 
-- Injuries: One settler was injured March 1 when 
Palestinians fired a mortar at Neve Dekalim settlement, 
according to UNRWA. 
 
-- Injuries: UNRWA reported that one Palestinian was shot and 
injured March 1 after soldiers in an IDF convoy on the

Palestinian shooting attack.

mortars were fired March 1-2: one at Neve Dekalim, one at an
