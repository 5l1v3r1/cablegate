(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to the director of the 
Israeli MFA's equivalent of IO/UNP on March 14.  The MFA's 
action officer later called to inform us that he will share 
the USG's points with the Israeli mission in New York and 
instruct them to support the USG position.  He noted that the 
only area in which the GOI may have a potentially different 
view is on the issue of personal liability of UN staff.  The 
MFA wants to avoid any solution that would complicate ongoing 
disputes with UN personnel in Israel, Gaza, and the West 
Bank.  According to the MFA, a number of UNRWA staff have 
claimed diplomatic immunity from Israeli regulations 
requiring auto liability insurance.
