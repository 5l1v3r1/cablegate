Â¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, the GOI reiterated plans to attend the 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) Plenary 
in The Hague in June 2009.  According to MFA Arms Control 
Advisor Israel Tikochinski, the GOI has not yet decided at 
what level the GOI will attend the plenary.  He noted that in 
the past, the GOI typically sends representatives from the 
MFA and the Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) to GICNT 
meetings; he suggested the GOI will likely follow the same 
course of action for the plenary.  Tikochinski had no further 
information regarding potential Israeli presentations at the 
plenary, but noted the GOI will likely make a national 
statement.  He promised to pass on details regarding the size 
and composition of the Israeli plenary delegation once a 
decision has been made.  Tikochinski also confirmed that the 
GOI will attend the upcoming GICNT event in Morocco, and 
addressed timing concerns regarding the proposed GICNT 
workshop hosted by Israel in November (septel). Polmiloff 
joined Counselor Yuri Rudakov from the Embassy of the Russian 
Federation and First Secretary John van der Zande from the 
Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in discussing these 
issues with Tikochinski on May 6.
