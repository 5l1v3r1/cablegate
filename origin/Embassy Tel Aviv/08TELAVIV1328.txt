¶1.  (SBU) Per reftel instructions, emboffs visited 
International Security & Defense Systems (ISDS) at its 
offices in Moshav Nir Tzvi in the Tel Aviv area and met with 
office manager Maurice Cusnir.  Cusnir provided emboffs the 
following information in response to their questions: 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Bona Fides:  ISDS is a security consulting company 
that was established in 1982.  It is solely owned by the 
company's President, Leo Gleser, and has 10-15 direct 
employees.  ISDS functions as a general contractor and 
provides its clients with security training, systems 
integration, risk assessment, and equipment, through a range 
of sub-contractors in the security field.  ISDS does not 
produce anything but promotes products of other companies. 
ISDS owns offices in the U.S., Peru, Argentina, Greece, 
India, and China; it has sub-contracted offices in Brazil, 
Ecuador, and Spain; and it has provided services in Angola, 
Nigeria, and South Africa. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Role of ISDS:  Cusnir explained that ISDS initially 
intended to broker the proposed transaction between ALS 
Technologies, Inc (ALS) and the International Commission 
Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) but no longer has any 
role in the transaction because ISDS did not obtain a U.S. 
brokering license in time.  Cusnir said that CICIG's security 
chief, Joseph Leal Millet, approached ISDS for firearms 
because he was familiar with the company from time Millet 
spent working as a UN official in Israel.  ISDS then 
approached ASL because the requested weapons were not 
available on the Israeli market.  ISDS encouraged ALS and 
CICIG to contract directly to complete the deal because ISDS 
does not have a U.S. brokering license.  Cusnir explained 
that although ISDS would receive no payment for the 
transaction as a result, the company hopes the deal will 
build good will with CICIG as a potential future customer. 
Cusnir expects that ASL will transfer the firearms in 
question directly to CICIG via air. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Company's On-Site Security and Understanding of 
USML Restrictions:  Cusnir said he was aware of U.S. 
licensing requirements and restrictions on USML items, 
including the requirement for brokers to register with the 
State Department, and ISDS is applying for a U.S. brokering 
license.  ISDS does not handle or store any sensitive 
equipment because it does not take possession of any 
equipment that it obtains for its clients as an intermediary. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Documentation:  Cusnir showed emboffs the following 
documents:  a purchase order numbered 0108 and signed by 
Joseph Leal Millet on 10 March 2008, an end-use statement 
signed by Joseph Leal Millet on 11 April 2008, and an 
end-user certificate signed by Joseph A. Leal on 10 March 
¶2008.  Cusnir also showed emboffs a sample of list of other 
ISDS clients.  All documents collected by emboffs have been 
sent by FAX to PM/DDTC at 202-261-8198. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Based on the above information, emboffs believe that 
ISDS is a legitimate company that functions as an 
intermediary to provide clients with a range of security 
services and equipment.
