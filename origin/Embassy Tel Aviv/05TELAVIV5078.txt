bring in cargo containers to remove the effects of those 
families leaving voluntarily.  The message below outlines the 
approximate numbers of families still remaining in the 
settlements; the overall security situation in Gaza; 
Palestinian reactions to disengagement; internal Israeli 
political developments, including PM Sharon's meeting with 
key opponents of disengagement in an effort to dampen active 
resistance to the withdrawal; and the closure and

suspension.  End Summary.

-- Israeli police detained Settlers Council officials Bentzi 
Lieberman, Pinhas Wallerstein, and Zeev Hever for questioning 
during a march towards Gush Katif August 15.  An estimated 
several hundred additional anti-disengagement activists were 
similarly detained outside of Gaza August 15.  Wallerstein 
announced in the Israeli media that he will maintain a hunger 
strike until he and other detainees are released. 
 
-- In the northern West Bank, the Kaddim and Gannim 
settlements have been completely evacuated.  In Homesh, 
long-term residents are reportedly discouraging young 
anti-disengagement infiltrators from protesting in the 
settlement. 
 
-- Neve Dekalim remained the center of protestor-IDF clashes 
August 16, with demonstrators blocking the main settlement 
road in an attempt to prevent soldiers from entering to hand 
out eviction notices, which the Israeli police claimed was a 
violation of an earlier agreement.  IDF troops were able to 
negotiate with settler leaders to bring in cargo containers 
to remove the household effects of those settler families 
choosing to leave voluntarily August 16.  Troops also brought 
in a water cannon and additional vehicles after demonstrators 
slashed the tires of military vehicles. 
 
-- According to the Israeli media, some GOI officials have 
indicated that a retroactive change in the Compensation Law 
could enable even those families who do not voluntarily leave 
the Gaza Strip by August 17 to receive most of their 
entitlement.  PM Sharon,s bureau publicly refuted these 
reports. 
 
-- Israeli media reported that senior IDF sources indicated 
the evacuation of the settlements would be complete by 
Thursday, August 25.  Media commentators suggested Gush Katif 
could be emptied of all settlers by August 21. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) SECURITY SITUATION 
 
-- Injuries/shootings: According to UNRWA, IDF fire injured 
one Palestinian in the Tel as-Sultan area early August 16. 
 
-- Shootings: According to the IDF, Palestinian militants 
engaged in three instances of shooting at IDF soldiers late 
August 15, two at Khan Yunis and one near Neve Dekalim 
settlement. 
 
-- Kidnapping: The French Channel 3 journalist kidnapped 
August 15 is still being held August 16.  The UN received 
reports that PA officials made contact with the abductors, 
but PA security forces were unable to confirm this. 
According to UNRWA, "word on the street" reports state that 
the journalist is being held near Jabaliya refugee camp, 
although this is unconfirmed.  UN security officials noted 
this is the first time since the October 2003 murders of U.S. 
security personnel that no entity has claimed responsibility 
for an attack within 24 hours. 
 
-- Incursions: According to UNRWA, IDF tanks and bulldozers 
entered the Mughraqa area near Netzarim, evacuating residents 
from the house of Ata al-Helo, and piling sand barriers in 
front of it. 
 
-- Approximately USD 2 million worth of communications gear 
from the EU COPPS program and the UK has been distributed to 
the PA security services down to the platoon level and is now 
operational.  The GOI fast-tracked getting this gear through 
Israeli customs and security inspections. 
 
-- The IDF has been providing liaison officers to the PA 
security services down to the company level.  Reports are 
that both sides are very satisfied with the coordination. 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) PALESTINIAN REACTIONS 
 
-- According to Israeli media reports, 7,500 PA security 
forces were stationed opposite Gush Katif August 16. 
 
-- Abu Ubeida, spokesman for Hamas, military wing, told the 
Israeli media August 15 that Hamas will continue armed 
struggle against Israel despite the disengagement.  Hamas has 
cited the withdrawal from Gaza as proof that attacks, 
including suicide bombings inside Green Line Israel, are the 
"only option." 
 
-- According to UNRWA, on August 15 PIJ held a march of 
approximately 1,500 people in the Nuseriat refugee camp, and 
Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade held a march of 1,000 people in Gaza 
City, to celebrate the disengagement. 
 
-- According to Gazan human rights organizations, 150 
residents of the al-Sayafa area in the northern Gaza Strip 
were prevented from traveling August 16 due to closures 
related to the evacuation of the Dugit and Alei Sinai 
settlements. 
 
-- A former Ministry of Religious Affairs official in Gaza 
City told Poloff that Gazans are divided into two camps 
regarding disengagement: one camp believes the economic 
situation will improve, the other believes closures will 
increase economic hardship.  Our contact placed himself among 
the optimists.  He recently switched careers to become an 
academic expert on the tourism industry, which he hopes will 
prosper post-disengagement. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) GOI POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
-- Prime Minister Sharon has been meeting August 16 with key 
opponents to disengagement in an attempt to dampen active 
resistance to the evacuation.  Leader of the National 
Religious Party Zevulun Orlev, a strong opponent of 
disengagement, announced publicly August 16 that he would not 
meet with Prime Minister Sharon. 
 
-- Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Josef told Shas Party 
chairman Eli Yishai to instruct Shas Knesset members to go to 
Gush Katif.  Shas MK Meshulam Nahari told Poloff August 16 
that all Shas MKs are already in or would soon arrive in Gush 
Katif, and that Yishai was there already.  He stressed that 
it was a "bad day" for the settlers and that Shas members 
would be going to "strengthen" them. 
 
-- The Interministerial Disengagement Committee met late 
August 15 to discuss relocation and housing for settlers. 
The Committee approved an increase in the number of hotel 
rooms reserved to absorb evacuees from 1,000 to 2,000. 
Additionally, the committee approved some 130 additional 
mobile homes for settler families who have agreed to leave 
the Gaza Strip voluntarily. 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) BORDER CROSSINGS/HUMANITARIAN ACCESS

ground in Gaza.
