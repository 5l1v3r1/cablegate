SUBJECT: ICRC PRESIDENT MEETS PRIME MINISTER OLMERT 
 
REF: SEPTEL 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  MFA Director of International Organizations Daniel 
Meron told poloff August 10 that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 
assured visiting ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger earlier 
that day that the GOI supports ICRC efforts to provide 
humanitarian assistance to civilians in southern Lebanon. 
Olmert emphasized, Meron said, that his government will 
respond to any special requests from ICRC.  Meron noted that 
Olmert gave to Kellenberger the phone number of his personal 
assistant so that Kellenberger can reach Olmert directly in 
case of an emergency.  Meron also said that Olmert cited the 
recent example in Houla, where Meron said that the IDF 
suspended military operations in order to allow ICRC to 
evacuate and provide medical attention to injured civilians. 
(See septel.)  Meron said Olmert informed Kellenberger that 
the GOI will allow an ICRC ship full of food and supplies to 
dock in Tyre. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Meron also explained that ICRC has asked the GOI 
to renew the practice of permitting family members to visit 
in Israeli jails those Palestinian prisoners from the Gaza 
Strip.  Olmert informed Kellenberger that the GOI would 
recommence this practice, which it halted following the June 
25 kidnapping of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit.
