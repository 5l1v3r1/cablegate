SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL ANNOUNCES NATIONAL PLAN TO 
COMBAT SLAVERY AND LABOR TRAFFICKING 
 
¶1. (U) THE GOI HAS DRAFTED A NATIONAL PLAN TO COMBAT HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING FOR THE PURPOSES OF SLAVERY AND FORCED LABOR, 
FOCUSING ON PROSECUTION, PREVENTION AND PROTECTION.  THE PLAN 
IS DESIGNED TO HELP MIGRANT WORKERS, WHO OFTEN PAY LARGE FEES 
TO AGENCIES THAT ARRANGE THEIR JOBS IN ISRAEL AND ARE THUS 
VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION -- INCLUDING COERCED SEXUAL 
SERVICES -- UNTIL THOSE FEES CAN BE RECOUPED.  THE PLAN WAS A 
JOINT EFFORT OF THE DIRECTORS-GENERAL OF THE MINISTRIES OF 
JUSTICE, PUBLIC SECURITY, INTERIOR, INDUSTRY, TRADE AND 
LABOR, FOREIGN AFFAIRS, HEALTH AND WELFARE, AS WELL AS THE 
PRIME MINISTERS OFFICE AND THE POLICE COMMISSIONER. 
 
¶2. (U) IN A MEETING ON JANUARY 10, 2007, THE COMMITTEE OF 
DIRECTORS GENERAL REGARDING THE BATTLE AGAINST TRAFFICKING IN 
PERSONS DECIDED ON A NATIONAL PLAN TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING FOR 
SLAVERY AND FORCED LABOR.  THE DECISION WAS BASED ON THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS OF A SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRED BY RACHEL GERSHUNI, 
APPOINTED LAST YEAR AS INTERMINISTERIAL ANTI-TRAFFICKING 
COORDINATOR.  THE GOI DESCRIBED THE PLAN AS A "NECESSARY 
FIRST STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRATEGY TO SUPPRESS THIS 
SCOURGE."  THE COORDINATOR'S OFFICE HAS A STATED "MESSIANIC 
VISION" TO "END TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS AND THUS MAKE OUR 
OFFICE UNNECESSARY", AN "OVERRIDING GOAL" TO "MAKE SURE THAT 
ISRAEL MEETS INTERNATIONAL CRITERIA IN REGARD TO THE BATTLE 
AGAINST TRAFFICKING, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON HUMAN RIGHTS", AND A 
"WORKING METHOD" TO "BRING ABOUT COOPERATION AMONG BODIES AND 
INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN THE FIELD." 
 
¶3. (U) THE COMMITTEE STATED FIVE PRIORITIES DURING THE FIRST 
STAGE: DIVIDING THE WORK BETWEEN ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN 
ORDER TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INDICTMENTS AGAINST EMPLOYERS 
WHO USE SLAVERY OR COERCION; DEVELOPING CRITERIA FOR 
IDENTIFYING VICTIMS OF SLAVERY; LAUNCHING AN INFORMATION 
CAMPAIGN IN THE WORKERS' COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN TO INFORM THEM 
OF THEIR RIGHTS; HELPING VICTIMS REPATRIATE TO THEIR 
COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN; AND FORMULATING A PACKAGE OF SERVICES 
FOR VICTIMS, INCLUDING SAFE HOUSES AND HEALTH CARE.  THE LACK 
OF FACILITIES FOR LABOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS HAS BEEN A 
PARTICULAR SORE POINT WITH NGOS IN ISRAEL.  FIVE TEAMS HAVE 
BEEN TASKED WITH DESIGNING WITHIN THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR 
MONTHS OPERATIVE STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THESE OBJECTIVES.  THE 
SUBCOMMITTEE THAT SUBMITTED THE RECOMMENDATIONS WAS APPOINTED 
AS A PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE THAT WILL MEET PERIODICALLY TO 
DEAL WITH PROBLEMS AND DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS. 
 
¶4. (U) THE COMMITTEE RECOGNIZED THAT ITS RECOMMENDATIONS MAY 
REQUIRE CHANGES IN EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE EMPLOYMENT 
OF FOREIGN WORKERS THAT "CREATE A CLIMATE FRIENDLY TO THE 
DEVELOPMENT" OF TRAFFICKING.  THE COMMITTEE ALSO EMPHASIZED 
THAT ITS RECOMMENDATIONS CONSTITUTE A NATIONAL PLAN, NOT 
OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES THAT "WILL NEED TO BE DESIGNED IN THE 
WAKE OF THE PLAN."  OTHER COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE 
CONSIDERATION OF A POLICY THAT WILL NOT ALLOW THE ENTRY OF 
FOREIGN WORKERS FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NO DIPLOMATIC 
REPRESENTATION IN ISRAEL, CLEAR PROCEDURES REGARDING THE 
TRANSFER OF INFORMATION AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, 
ENFORCING EXISTING LAWS PROHIBITING MIDDLEMAN FEES, PLACEMENT 
OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN DETENTION FACILITIES, LEGAL AID TO 
VICTIMS OF SLAVERY AND LABOR TRAFFICKING, AND HEIGHTENED 
SUPERVISION OF THE EGYPTIAN BORDER.  INDUSTRY, TRADE AND 
LABOR MINISTRY INSPECTORS, IMMIGRATION OFFICERS AND POLICE 
ARE ALREADY UNDERGOING TRAINING TO HELP THEM RECOGNIZE 
TRAFFICKING.
