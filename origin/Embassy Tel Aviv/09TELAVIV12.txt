SUBJECT: ISRAEL MEDIA REACTION 
 
-------------------------------- 
SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT: 
-------------------------------- 
 
Gaza Operation 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The media reported that yesterday the IDF continued its ground 
operations in Gaza, and showed that it is readying an expanded 
ground operation.  An IDF soldier was killed and 40 wounded.  Israel 
Radio reported on Hamas attempts to kidnap an Israeli solider and on 
false Hamas claims to have successfully abducted Israeli soldiers. 
Israel Radio cited Palestinian sources as saying that 70 
Palestinians were killed in the ground operation. 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted senior diplomatic officials as saying 
yesterday that the IDF has a Qfew more daysQ to carry on with its 
Gaza offensive and weaken Hamas before the international community 
ratchets up pressure for a cease-fire.  Over the weekend the media 
quoted Israeli officials as saying that the IDF has called up tens 
of thousands of reservists for the ground operation.  Maariv and The 
Jerusalem Post cited the Israeli concern that Hamas might launch 
missiles on Rehovot and Rishon Lezion -Q over 40 km from the Gaza 
border. 
 
HaQaretz reported that yesterday PM Ehud Olmert and his Foreign and 
Defense ministers, Tzipi Livni and Ehud Barak, decided that Israel 
would like to see a diplomatic agreement bring the military 
operation in Gaza to an end -Q so long as the deal excludes Hamas. 
The newspaper reported that Israeli leadership will convey that 
message to visiting European statesmen today, stressing that an 
agreement in Gaza should include both regional and international 
components. 
 
Maariv (Ben Caspit) reported that Iran recently sent Israel an 
explicit warning.  This warning was passed on by means of a 
Scandinavian embassy in Tehran, and it read as follows: If you 
launch a ground operation in the Gaza Strip, weQll act against you. 
 
Maariv and The Jerusalem Post quoted Vice President Dick Cheney as 
saying on Saturday on CBSQs QFace the NationQ that Israel did not 
ask for U.S permission before its incursion into Gaza.  Cheney 
reiterated the U.S position placing exclusive responsibility for the 
situation on Hamas.  Yesterday Israel Radio reported that the U.S. 
administration is working for a cease-fire.  State Department 
Spokesman Sean McCormack was quoted as saying that the 
administration is very concerned over the humanitarian situation in 
Gaza, but added that Hamas is the one holding the inhabitants of the 
Gaza Strip hostage.  He said that Israel must be alert to the 
effects of the ground operation on the civilians in Gaza.  McCormack 
said that a cease-fire must be established as quickly as possible, 
but emphasized that it must be long-term and acceptable to all 
sides. 
 
The media reported that yesterday New York City Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg flew to Israel for a daylong trip to express solidarity 
for Israelis under Hamas fire. 
 
Yediot reported that Israel is trying to recruit international 
support, with the backing of the U.S. and Germany, to reach a 
unilateral agreement. 
 
Leading media reported that Israel is injecting humanitarian aid 
into Gaza. 
 
The media reported that over the weekend protesters across Europe 
urged Israel to end its military campaign.  Israel Radio quoted 
Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan as saying yesterday that Israel is 
doing inhuman deeds in Gaza and it will destroy itself. 
 
HaQaretz and other media reported that IDF Intelligence head Maj. 
Gen. Amos Yadlin told the cabinet on Sunday that Hizbullah might 
carry out a limited attack in the north via a Palestinian terror 
group in response to the IDF ground operation.  HaQaretz quoted a 
government source in Jerusalem as saying that the military is on 
high alert in the north against a flare-up.  The source said that 
many reservists have been called up for service in the north. 
 
Yesterday, citing the AP, The Jerusalem Post reported that an 
Israeli air strike flattened GazaQs best private educational 
institution, the American International School in Beit Lahiya, which 
has been targeted by Islamic militants in the past. 
 
HaQaretz reported that the Finance Ministry is budgeting 2.4 billion 
shekels (around $635 million) for the war in Gaza and that if 
spending passes this point, the reserve will run out.  Maariv wrote 
that the cost of the war is estimated at 10 billion shekels (around 
$2.65 billion). 
 
HaQaretz and The Jerusalem Post reported that QWaltz with Bashir, 
the animated documentary about Israeli soldiers and their memories 
of IsraelQs 1982 war with Lebanon, was chosen best picture of 2008 
by the National Society of Film Critics.

Gaza Operation: 
--------------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: QSarkozy is a 
friendly leader who during his term in office has contributed to 
Israel's improved standing in Europe.  Israel can return the favor 
for his support and bestow on him a diplomatic achievement if it 
adopts his initiative for a lull in the fighting. 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote on page one of the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot: QThe government should 
listen to its own pessimistic forecasts at the start of the 
operation, rather than to the euphoria that enveloped it in the 
following days.  There is nothing more treacherous than euphoria in 
time of battle. 
 
Military correspondent Alex Fishman wrote on page one of Yediot 
Aharonot: QOn the 10th day of warfare, are we close to meeting the 
goals of the operation?  The answer: Not yet. 
 
Veteran journalist and anchor Yaron London wrote in Yediot Aharonot: 
QQProportionalityQ should not be measured by the number of corpses 
but by the foeQs  malevolence.... HamasQs ideology does not allow 
this movement to cease fire of its own volition. 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: QThose 
who are sincere about fostering coexistence should stop bashing the 
IDF and start telling the Palestinians: Stop the violence. 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar'el wrote in Ha'aretz: QA 
lasting diplomatic solution to the Gaza situation demands more than 
an agreement between Hamas and Israel -- it demands pan-Arab 
reconciliation. 
Arab affairs correspondent Smadar Perry wrote in Yediot Aharonot: 
Q[Foreign Minister Ahmed] Abu al-Gheit first and foremost serves the 
interests of Egypt, which at present appear to match the Israeli 
interests: To get rid of the Hamas leadership. 
 
Block Quotes: 
------------- 
 
Â¶I.  "Lull Now" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (1/5): QIsrael 
embarked on Operation Cast Lead with the aim of stopping rocket and 
mortar fire on its territory, weakening Hamas, and improving the 
security situation in the south.  It is vital to preserve these 
goals and not get dragged into a futile pursuit of Hamas in an 
effort to topple its regime.  Experience teaches that expanding the 
set of objectives complicates achieving them, turning a 
lightning-quick operation into a long war of attrition.  The 
government and IDF succeeded in mustering domestic and international 
legitimacy for an extensive military operation against the rocket 
fire, and it would be a pity to risk that legitimacy if the fighting 
drags on Quntil Hamas waves a white flagQ.... Sarkozy is a friendly 
leader who during his term in office has contributed to Israel's 
improved standing in Europe.  Israel can return the favor for his 
support and bestow on him a diplomatic achievement if it adopts his 
initiative for a lull in the fighting and declares its readiness to 
begin immediate negotiations on a new, stable security arrangement 
in the Gaza Strip. 
 
II.  "Time to Say QEnoughQ" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote on page one of the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (1/5): QWhether a 
cease-fire agreement is reached or not, the Hamasniks who have been 
killed and will yet be killed will be replaced by others, and new 
[arms] depots will be built instead of the ones destroyed.  The key 
is to prevent arms and ammunition smuggling from Egypt.  If success 
is achieved on this score, with the aid of international efforts and 
cooperation on Egypt's part, Hamas will lose a large part of its 
destructive potential.  About this too, we can say: It will be 
enough for us.  The government must not [let the operation] evolve, 
it must not be tempted, it must not become entangled.  The Hamas 
militiamen, who instead of directly fighting the soldiers 
disappeared yesterday into the alleyways or hid in their bunkers, 
were not being cowardly.  They were trying to draw Israel inwards, 
into places that it must not reach.  The next two days will be 
critical: The cease-fire, which was rightfully rejected out of hand 
last Wednesday, will look more correct and riper after the end of 
the first stage of the ground operation.  The government should 
listen to its own pessimistic forecasts at the start of the 
operation, rather than to the euphoria that enveloped it in the 
following days.  There is nothing more treacherous than euphoria in 
time of battle. 
 
III.  "We HavenQt Won Yet" 
 
Military correspondent Alex Fishman wrote on page one of Yediot 
Aharonot (1/5): QOn the 10th day of warfare, are we close to meeting 
the goals of the operation?  The answer: Not yet.  Hamas may regret, 
as [an] intelligence officer said to the Defense Minister, but it 
has still not broken.  It has taken a very serious blow -- but is 
standing on its feet and conducting warfare with order and a 
rationale.  The next exit point, in which it will be possible to 
discuss an arrangement, will apparently and unfortunately only be 
after the completion of the limited ground move and the takeover of 
the Qholding area. 
 
IV.  "Sorry for Having Been Right" 
 
Veteran journalist and anchor Yaron London wrote in Yediot Aharonot 
(1/5): QThose who view the border issue as I do should have 
supported the withdrawal from Gaza.  At the same time, they should 
have demanded that for any violation of our territory the enemy 
should pay a price dubbed in the juristsQ lingo Qdisproportionate. 
 QProportionalityQ should not be measured by the number of corpses 
but by the foeQs  malevolence.... HamasQs ideology does not allow 
this movement to cease fire of its own volition.  Hamas aspires to 
apply an Islamic religious rule, establish a Palestinian state in 
the entire Land of Israel [a.k.a. Palestine], and set up an 
equitable and prosperous society.  [HamasQs] three goals Q- 
religious, diplomatic, and social -Q cannot be implemented 
simultaneously. 
 
Â¶V.  QA Moral War 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (1/5): 
QFar from there being Q3,000 [Palestinians] killed and wounded, 
more like 500 have been killed -- 400 of them Hamas Qmilitants, 
according to Palestinian Arab and UN sources inside Gaza cited by 
the Associated Press. Israeli sources put the Palestinian civilian 
death toll at some 50.... Pointing this out does not diminish the 
dreadful loss of dozens of innocent Palestinian lives in a week's 
worth of fighting.  It does show, however, that the IDF continues to 
do everything possible to avoid Qcollateral damage.Q  But its prime 
mandate is to protect the lives of Israeli civilians and minimize 
risks to our citizen-soldiers.... The folks at [the liberal 
Jewish-American lobby] J Street believe Qthere is no military 
solution to what is fundamentally a political conflict....Q Hamas 
would beg to differ.  Indeed, Hamas has been trying to prove the 
contrary, forcing Israel's hand.  What Israel's critics need to 
understand is that there can be no political solution while we are 
under Palestinian bombardment.  Those who are sincere about 
fostering coexistence should stop bashing the IDF and start telling 
the Palestinians: Stop the violence. 
 
VI.  QEgypt-Syria-Rift 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar'el wrote in Ha'aretz 
(1/4): QThe intensification of the military operation in Gaza has 
not yet led to a similar increase in the Arab states' diplomatic 
efforts.  A lasting diplomatic solution to the Gaza situation 
demands more than an agreement between Hamas and Israel -- it 
demands pan-Arab reconciliation.... The opening of the Rafah 
crossing between Egypt and Gaza is a vital condition for a 
cease-fire, but Cairo fears that letting Hamas control the crossing 
will bring it Arab and international recognition, while Cairo will 
be left responsible for the Strip.  For its part, Syria is striving 
to obtain Hamas recognition that would grant it and Iran positions 
of influence in any future diplomatic process. Saudi Arabia has 
adopted the Egyptian stance, which sees Hamas as the primary culprit 
for the current situation, and both countries have a double account 
to settle -- with Hamas, for not adhering to the provisions of the 
2007 Mecca Agreement, intended to end the group's feud with Fatah, 
and for sabotaging the planned November summit in Cairo; and with 
Syria for torpedoing talks between the rival groups. If [a] 
cease-fire holds, the second stage can go into effect, in which 
Turkey mediates among Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Egypt to draft an 
Arab agreement for reconciling Hamas and Fatah, after which 
Palestinian elections may be held.  In the meantime, the Turkish 
proposal seems like a distant vision that can offer no immediate 
solution to the fighting. 
 
VII.  QCommon Interests 
 
Arab affairs correspondent Smadar Perry wrote in Yediot Aharonot 
(1/5): QWe should not hurry to see [the Egyptian Foreign Minister] 
as a Qlover of ZionQ or the QZionist foreign minister,Q as he is 
derided by the Arab world.  Abu al-Gheit first and foremost serves 
the interests of Egypt, which at present appear to match the Israeli 
interests: To get rid of the Hamas leadership, not to open the 
crossings, to suffocate and make life unbearable until Abu Mazen's 
regime returns to Gaza.... A word of warning: Do not give him 
commendations from Jerusalem, do not shower praise on him, and do 
not make a mistake about the Egyptian Foreign Minister.  If the 
operation becomes entangled to Egypt's detriment, Abu al-Gheit will 
be the first to lash ot at us as he is now pounding Hamas.
