Key stories in the media:

Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was quoted as saying in an 
interview with Ha'aretz on Sunday that peace cannot be achieved 
without talking to all the relevant people and that he intends to 
check Hamas leader Khaled Mashal's willingness to accept the Arab 
League peace initiative.  Ha'aretz reported that Carter visited 
Sderot and Ashkelon.  Carter called on the U.S. to start a direct 
dialogue with Iran.  The media quoted Carter as saying that Syria 
must be brought into the peace process.  Ha'aretz quoted U.S. 
sources as saying on Monday the Shin Bet declined to assist Carter 
during his visit and reported that the sources described the snub as 
an "unprecedented" breach between the Shin Bet and the U.S. Secret 
Service. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that there is growing pessimism in the 
Israeli defense establishment concerning the fate of the two IDF 
reservists, Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, who were kidnapped by 
Hizbullah in July 2006.  The conclusion was reached after analysis 
of recent comments made by Hizbullah leader Hassan Nasrallah.  The 
paper also carried speculation printed in the Lebanese paper 
an-Nahar that Israel is no longer pursuing a prisoner swap since it 
is convinced the pair are no longer alive. 
 
Leading media reported that yesterday Qatar's prime minister, Hamad 
bin Jasim bin Jabir al-Thani, urged FM Tzipi Livni to end Israel's 
"crippling blockade of Gaza out of respect  for the difficult 
humanitarian situation"  and to accelerate negotiations  on a 
final-status arrangement.  The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin 
Khalifa al-Thani, hosted Livni for lunch at his palace after holding 
a formal meeting also attended by his PM, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem. 
Omani Foreign Minister Yousef Bin Alawi Bin Abdulla and Turkish 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan also attended the lunch.  Livni 
told the emir that Israel was interested in enlisting the Arab 
world, and especially the Gulf states, to help the Palestinian 
Authority advance in the peace process.  Media reported that Syria, 
Iran, and Lebanon condemned Livni's visit to Qatar. 
 
In her speech at the Doha Forum, FM Livni declared that Gaza 
militant groups' ongoing conflict with Israel is frustrating 
Palestinian ambitions for statehood.  Livni also called on Arab 
states not to view the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the cause of 
extremism.  Moments after delivering her address, Livni traded barbs 
over the nature of Israeli democracy with MK Ahmed Tibi, who 
attended the conference.  In a question and answer session following 
the speech, Tibi (United Arab List-Ta'al) asked for an opportunity 
to respond to Livni's comments, and told her, "Israel is an 
apartheid state. How can you speak about democracy when you speak 
about a Jewish state?" 
 
Ha'aretz reported that the U.S. administration intends to give the 
Senate Intelligence Committee an account of the nuclear ties between 
North Korea and Syria for the first time on April 22.  However, 
Ha'aretz reported that senior IDF officers have warned that the 
release of any information containing details of the IAF strike in 
Syria last September could increase tension between Israel and 
Syria.  The Jerusalem Post reported that the public status of the 
hearing is still undecided. 
 
Leading media reported on  strongly worded travel advisory issued by 
the Counter-Terrorism Bureau to Israeli citizens to stay out of the 
Sinai. 
 
Maariv reported that the 20 residents of the unauthorized settler 
outpost Mevo Horon Tzafon (Mevo Horon North) were quietly removed. 
The newspaper reported that in exchange the government allowed the 
Yesha Council of Settlements in the Territories to expand 
construction in other settlements. 
 
Major media reported that Defense Minister Ehud Barak decided 
yesterday to renew the supply of diesel gas to Gaza for the 
Palestinian power plant there starting Wednesday. 
 
Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer was quoted as saying in an 
interview with The Jerusalem Post that maintaining prolonged and 
significant growth of the Israeli economy is critical to Israel's 
physical well-being and security. 
 
Ha'aretz highlighted the conciliatory message that President Shimon 
Peres gave the Poles during his visit to the extermination camp of 
Treblinka. 
Yediot quoted Silvio Berlusconi, the frontrunner in the Italian 
legislative elections, as saying yesterday that his first visit 
abroad as PM would to Israel. 
 
Leading media reported that Moshe Rosenfeld, one of Israel's best 
known journalists and a former editor of Maariv, passed away ion 
Monday, aged 93. 
 
Major media reported that the Qatar-based Aljazeera-TV has agreed to 
discuss its coverage of the Israeli-Arab conflict with Israel.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: "In terms of 
results, at the end of the day, [Jimmy] Carter beats out any of 
those who ostracize him.  For the peace agreement with Egypt, he 
deserves the respect reserved for royalty for the rest of his 
life." 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one of the 
popular, pluralist Maariv: "The outpost that was evacuated yesterday 
is the first swallow that heralds the arrival of the king [i.e. 
President Bush].  This was no actual step, this is no change in 
policy." 
 
Eshkol Nevo, a young author and grandson of the late prime minister 
Levi Eshkol, wrote in the mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot: "Might [negotiations with Syria] not bring durable quiet 
along Israel's entire northern border and change the entire balance 
of forces in the Middle East?"

¶I.  "Our Debt to Jimmy Carter" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (4/15): "The 
government of Israel is boycotting Jimmy Carter, the 39th President 
of the United States, during his visit here this week.... The 
boycott will not be remembered as a glorious moment in this 
government's history.  Jimmy Carter has dedicated his life to 
humanitarian missions, to peace, to promoting democratic elections, 
and to better understanding between enemies throughout the world.... 
But Israelis have not liked him since he wrote the book 'Palestine: 
Peace not Apartheid' Israel is not ready for such comparisons, even 
though the situation begs it.... In the peace agreement with Egypt, 
30 years ago, Israel agreed to 'full autonomy' for the occupied 
territories, not to settle there.  These promises have been 
forgotten by Israel, but Carter remembers.  Whether Carter's 
approach to conflict resolution is considered by the Israeli 
government as appropriate or defeatist, no one can take away from 
the former U.S. president his international standing, nor the fact 
that he brought Israel and Egypt to a signed peace that has since 
held.  Carter's method, which says that it is necessary to talk with 
every one, has still not proven to be any less successful than the 
method that calls for boycotts and air strikes.  In terms of 
results, at the end of the day, Carter beats out any of those who 
ostracize him.  For the peace agreement with Egypt, he deserves the 
respect reserved for royalty for the rest of his life." 
 
II.  "The Swallow that Heralds the Arrival of the King" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one of the 
popular, pluralist Maariv (4/15): "There is no reason to be amazed 
by the quiet evacuation of [the settler outposts] 'Mevo Horon North' 
or QMevo Horon SouthQ yesterday.  What does this evacuation mean? 
Nothing.  Mainly the imminent arrival of George Bush.  The outpost 
that was evacuated yesterday is the first swallow that heralds the 
arrival of the king.  This was no actual step, this is no change in 
policy, this was not and will not be a courageous decision that will 
implement the recommendations of the Talia Sasson committee, the 
committee that Ariel Sharon established and which pointed out all 
the failures of Israeli governments over the last few decades.... 
The settlers will continue to play cat and mouse with the state, 
there will be many more 'arrangements' for 'voluntary evacuation' or 
'pretend evacuation' or 'evacuation against Talia Sasson' but 
nothing real will happen.  For this to happen, we need a leadership 
that will decide if we are here or there, and then carry it out. 
There is no such thing in Israel and there never will be." 
 
III.  "Weaning Ourselves of the Palestinians" 
 
Eshkol Nevo, a young author and grandson of the late prime minister 
Levi Eshkol, wrote in the mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot(4/15): "For over 15 years most of Israel's diplomatic 
efforts have been directed at one goal: achieving an agreement to 
divide the land with the representatives of the Palestinians 
people.... Only one thing has been missing during all those years: 
peace.... Israel has been signaling its willingness to reach a 
solution of peace to its border conflict with Israel.... The Syrians 
are no friends of the Jews... [However] we may not be holding 
negotiations with Syria because we are addicted to the Palestinians? 
 Is it possible that we have become accustomed to the convenience of 
hiccupping negotiations that do not demand any price from us.... 
Might [negotiations with Syria] not bring lasting peace salong 
Israel's entire northern border and change the entire balance of 
forces in the Middle East?"

¶2.  Iran: 
--------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: "Those 
gathering this week in Shanghai should not delude themselves into 
believing that the rapacious Islamist regime in Tehran does not also 
threaten everything they hold dear."

"The Mullah Minuet" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (4/15): 
"It was a small news item, easily unnoticed, part of a protracted 
series of deceptions: 'Monday's scheduled meeting in Vienna between 
Iranian nuclear negotiator Gholamreza Aghazadeh and the UN's nuclear 
watchdog Mohamed ElBaradei has been postponed.'  One step back in 
the minuet.  Meanwhile, the Iranian Foreign Ministry announced that 
it would 'propose a package of solutions' aimed at 'convergence' 
with international proposals offering Iran nuclear technology in 
return for ending its pursuit of nuclear weapons.  One step forward 
-- ostensibly.... No one in Shanghai will suggest an international 
ban on weapons sales to Iran. There will be no talk of any air or 
sea embargo.  Still, the great powers will probably express 
'disquiet' over the installation of hundreds, if not thousands, more 
centrifuges at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.... There are 
too many sticks and not enough carrots, some of the diplomats in 
Shanghai will claim. But Iran has time and again rejected generous 
international offers of nuclear fuel and technology in return for 
abandoning its bomb.... Those gathering this week in Shanghai should 
not delude themselves into believing that the rapacious Islamist 
regime in Tehran does not also threaten everything they hold dear. 
Iran already has all of Israel well within its missile range, and 
still it extends its delivery capabilities."
