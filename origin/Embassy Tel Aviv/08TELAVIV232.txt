¶1.  Final Winograd Report 
 
¶2.  Mideast 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All major media led with the political situation on the eve of the 
publication of the final Winograd report.  Ha'aretz and other media 
quoted associates of PM Ehud Olmert as saying on Monday that he has 
no intention of scheduling early elections.  The Jerusalem Post and 
other media reported that Olmert took steps to reinforce his 
coalition by issuing reassuring statements to Kadima, Labor, and 
Shas MKs in a speech to the Kadima faction.  Yediot quoted Olmert 
associates as saying that Defense Minister Ehud Barak may resign, 
but that Kadima will not set a date for early elections.  Maariv 
reported that associates of Olmert and Barak are placing 
responsibility for the government's future at one another's feet. 
Maariv cited an assessment within the Labor Party that Barak will 
act to advance the elections. 
 
Israel Radio reported that in his State of the Union Address, 
President Bush reaffirmed his support for a two-state solution and 
his determination not to let Iran acquire nuclear weapons. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Israel will try to share control of the 
Rafah border with Egypt.  Media reported that Hamas refuses to let 
the PA share control of the border.  Maariv reported that Hamas told 
Egypt that it will return control to Egypt if it opens the Rafah 
crossing.  Yediot and other media reported that Egypt has asked 
Israel to help resolve the Rafah crisis, saying that it will seal 
the border by the end of the week and that Israel should accept 
European observers and the transfer of responsibility to the PA. 
The Jerusalem Post quoted the EU foreign ministers as saying on 
Monday that the EU would "consider resuming its monitoring mission 
at Rafah."  Leading media reported that Hamas stressed its 
opposition to allowing the PA to control the border.  Major media 
reported that Iran announced on Monday that it will soon renew its 
diplomatic ties with Egypt. 
 
Ha'aretz and The Jerusalem Post reported that U.S. Roadmap monitor 
Lt. Gen. William Fraser launched his mission on Monday. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that Democratic presidential contender Sen. Barack 
Obama told Israeli reporters and the American Jewish press that a 
"constant virulent campaign" was being waged against him, that Jews 
have nothing to fear from him, and that there is no substance to 
allegations that he is a Muslim who does not swear allegiance to the 
U.S.  Obama was also quoted as saying that he believes in Israel "as 
a Jewish state," that he does not accept that a right of return for 
Palestinians can be interpreted "in any literal way," that he 
opposes talks with Hamas as long as the Islamist organization 
refuses to recognize Israel, and that he believes in a two state 
solution for two nations, but only as long as Israel has "security" 
that the Palestinians will not only sign on to in a final agreement, 
but also actualize. 
 
Maariv reported that the Mauritanian opposition is applying strong 
pressure to its government to revoke its ties with Israel because of 
the Gaza crisis. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that a new, state-authorized radio 
station catering to West Bank settlers could be established 
somewhere in the West Bank as early in April, unless a pending High 
Court petition torpedoes the move. 
 
All media reported that on Monday the High Court of Justice 
sentenced Omri Sharon, the former PM's son, to seven months 
imprisonment.  Sharon, a former Knesset member, was convicted of 
concealing illegal contributions from secret donors to his father's 
1999 campaign for the chairmanship of the Likud Party. 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi Yona Metzger as 
saying in an interview with the British weekly The Jewish News that 
hardships suffered by the Palestinians in Gaza should be resolved by 
setting up a state for them in the Sinai.  Metzger was also quoted 
as saying that while peaceable Arabs should be allowed to pray in 
Jerusalem mosques, they should recognize that Jerusalem belongs to 
the Jews. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that on Monday four Israeli-Arab Knesset members 
attended the funeral of George Habash, the founder of the 
Palestinian Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), outside 
Amman. 
 
Israel Radio reported that based on the invitation of Knesset 
Speaker Dalia Itzik, German FM Angela Merkel and French President 
Nicolas Sarkozy will both address the Knesset in honor of Israel's 
60th anniversary celebrations. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that on Monday MK Benny Elon, Chairman of the 
Knesset's Science and Technology Committee, told members of a NASA 
delegation visiting Israel that Israel would like to send another 
astronaut to participate in a NASA expedition. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that the Joshua Fund, an American 
evangelical organization, has decided to "adopt" Barzilai Medical 
Center (hospital) in Ashkelon.  The fund aims to invest at least 
$1.2 million in humanitarian relief over the next year for Israeli, 
Lebanese, and Palestinians families devastated by war and 
terrorism. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that renowned Israeli author David Grossman was 
awarded an honorary doctorate in international literature by the 
University of Florence in a ceremony held on Sunday to coincide with 
European Holocaust Day. 
 
Ha'aretz and The Jerusalem Post reported that Israeli companies 
listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) will now be able to 
automatically register for trading on the pan-European Euronext 
stock exchange in Paris. 
 
Leading media reported on the upcoming visits to Israel of Cisco 
Chairman John Chambers and Dr. Jacob Richter, a member of the senior 
management of Juniper Networks.

¶1.  Final Winograd Report: 
-------------------------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Veteran journalist Hemmi Shalev wrote on page one of the independent 
Israel Hayom: "One could receive the impression that the final 
stages of the war in Lebanon were a masterpiece that the Prime 
Minister conducted as if he were a statesman on the order of at 
least Napoleon and Montgomery -- and not that this was a bitter, 
hasty and superfluous battle that took the lives of dozens 
needlessly.  Olmert's spin masters are now counting on this." 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one of the 
popular, pluralist Maariv: "If the [Winograd] report's tone ... 
leads clearly to the conclusion that Olmert must go home, everything 
will change.  On the other hand, if it is lukewarm ... [Olmert] will 
be able to breathe easy."

¶I.  "This Should Have Ended Long Ago" 
 
Veteran journalist Hemmi Shalev wrote on page one of the independent 
Israel Hayom (1/29): "It would be hard to describe a harsher or more 
blatant or graver or more unequivocal indictment against the Prime 
Minister than the one submitted last April-- and it is hard to think 
of a final and summary synopsis that will not be viewed now as a 
disappointing anticlimax.... The long waiting period wracked the 
nerves of the political establishment and weakened the judgment of 
the media, and now, on the last lap, everyone is firing all their 
ammunition from all their guns and in every venue, and the spins and 
the speculations are flying as if there were no tomorrow.  This is 
so extreme, that from some of the reports on the war's final days, 
one could receive the impression that the final stages of the war in 
Lebanon were a masterpiece that the Prime Minister conducted as if 
he were a statesman on the order of at least Napoleon and Montgomery 
-- and not that this was a bitter, hasty and superfluous battle that 
took the lives of dozens needlessly.  Olmert's spin masters are now 
counting on this." 
 
 
II.  "Preoccupied" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote on page one of the 
popular, pluralist Maariv (1/29): "The statements of Judge Eliyahu 
Winograd, which will echo at six o'clock on Wednesday evening in 
Jerusalem's International Convention Center, will shuffle the cards 
-- this way, or that way.  If the report's tone is harsh, 
unequivocal, obvious, and leads clearly to the conclusion that 
Olmert must go home, everything will change.  On the other hand, if 
it is lukewarm, focuses on the army and levels reasonable criticism 
at the Prime Minister while mentioning the process of learning 
lessons and reconstruction, he will be able to breathe easy.  Judge 
WinogradQs body language, statements, the terms he uses, the 
commentary, the headlines that spread in their wake, and the public 
response will all decide the fate of Olmert's government this week, 
for good or ill.  The way is looks now, good is in the lead."

¶2.  Mideast: 
------------ 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: "The 
decision to build a border fence ... is not about a particular 
crisis, but the fulfillment of a basic long-term need." 
 
Gershon Baskin, Co-Director of the Israel/Palestine Center for 
Research and Information (IPCRI), wrote in The Jerusalem Post: 
"(The)new reality, which is far from desirable from an Israeli point 
of view, could be turned around in Israel's favor." 
 
Liberal columnist Gadi Taub wrote in the popular, pluralist Maariv: 
"The simultaneous use of an aggressive policy, both toward the 
illegal outposts as well as toward those who fire Qassam rockets, 
will make it clear that the laws of policy, not of gangs, apply to 
this conflict."

¶I.  "Time for Hourglass" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (1/29): 
"In 2005, just before Israel withdrew unilaterally from Gaza ... 
then deputy IDF chief of staff Moshe Kaplinsky drew up a plan to 
build a proper barrier along the international (Israel/Egypt) 
border.  The plan was called Project Hourglass.  Back then, 
Hourglass was estimated to cost $1.5 billion.  That is a lot of 
money, but as has been seen with the security fence in Judea and 
Samaria (i.e. the West Bank), even a partial barrier can be a major 
asset in preventing the infiltration of terrorists and catching them 
if they do.... The border with Egypt is not a temporary one, nor is 
it in dispute.  As the U.S. is discovering regarding its border with 
Mexico, even peaceful borders often need to be fenced off in order 
for nations to exercise their sovereignty and determine who may 
enter.  The decision to build a border fence, accordingly, is not 
about a particular crisis, but the fulfillment of a basic long-term 
need.  This need existed before Gaza fell to Hamas, and it will 
exist even if the threat from Hamas is removed.  It is an investment 
worth making now that will benefit the nation far into the future." 
 
II.  "The Prospect of a New Gaza Reality" 
 
Gershon Baskin, Co-Director of the Israel/Palestine Center for 
Research and Information (IPCRI), wrote in The Jerusalem Post 
(1/29): "(The)new reality, which is far from desirable from an 
Israeli point of view, could be turned around in Israel's favor. 
Recognizing that the smuggling of people, money, and weapons have 
been taking place under the Gaza/Egypt border for years, even when 
Israel fully occupied Gaza, the new reality brings that smuggling 
above ground and ads the possibility that Egypt will station border 
inspectors on the Egyptian side of Rafah.  Furthermore, it is 
possible to renegotiate the agreement with the European Union on the 
stationing of EU monitors on the border.  It could be possible to 
move those EU monitors to the Egyptian side of the border, which 
would remove any Israeli control over the monitors' movement and 
enable at least some form of third-party supervision over the 
border.  The most obvious advantage for Israel, and probably for 
Gaza as well, is if the new arrangements enable the Gaza border to 
remain open and Israel to wash its hands of Gaza entirely.  Israel 
would be able to claim that it is no longer responsible for the 
welfare of the Palestinian people of Gaza.... While taking these 
bold steps, Israel could offer the Palestinians in Gaza a cease-fire 
arrangement that the Hamas leadership has been trying to achieve 
without success." 
 
III.  "The Whining Cossacks" 
 
Liberal columnist Gadi Taub wrote in the popular, pluralist Maariv 
(1/29): "In the settlements, as in Gaza, the mentality of the robbed 
Cossack comes to the fore: Beat and cry; shoot and also whine that 
you are the victim.  In both cases the government can restore the 
principle of responsibility: Those who fire will be considered 
responsible, and not be considered victims.  The simultaneous use of 
an aggressive policy, both toward the illegal outposts as well as 
toward those who fire Qassam rockets, will make it clear that the 
laws of policy, not of gangs, apply to this conflict.  Israel is not 
picking on the Palestinians, but rather demanding insistence on the 
outline whose goal is to divide the land, and in the long term -- 
peace."
