SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT:

Mideast 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Leading media reported that PM Ehud Olmert and his wife Aliza will 
dine this evening with President Bush and his wife Laura.  Yediot 
quoted Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as saying yesterday that 
the political situation in Israel does not allow for the achievement 
of a peace treaty with the Palestinians by the end of BushQs term. 
The Jerusalem Post highlighted OlmertQs meeting with Deputy National 
Security Advisor Elliott Abrams and reported that Olmert is seeking 
a Qfinal tailwind for the Syrian track. 
 
The global/local financial crisis dominated the weekendQs headlines. 
 HaQaretz reported that the Finance MinistryQs budgets division 
wrote in a position paper at the beginning of November that the 
global crisis is the worst since 1929 and surmised that the impact 
of the world economic recession will be felt in a global and 
export-based economy like IsraelQs.  All media reported that the 
Finance Ministry is leaning toward laying out a safety net for 
pension and provident fund participants over age 60 who earn less 
than double the minimum wage,3,850 shekels (about $960) a month. 
 
Yesterday HaQaretz reported on Israeli defense establishment 
recommendations to make contingency plans to attack Iran, to reach 
an agreement with Syria that includes leaving the Golan and to 
prevent new elections in the PA, even if this means a confrontation 
with the U.S. 
 
Leading media reported that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas 
threatened to announce new elections if Hamas does not compromise 
with Fatah.  HaQaretz quoted AP as saying that yesterday Hamas 
denounced Hebrew-language newspaper ads outlining an Arab peace deal 
that Abbas published in Israeli papers. 
 
HaQaretz quoted the IDF as saying that reoccupation of part of Gaza, 
should the government agree to it, will cost 17 million shekels 
(about $4.225 million) per day. 
Maariv reported that the Israeli defense establishment fears the 
appointment of Gen. James Jones to national security adviser, but 
hopes that Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, will balance the 
U.S. administrationQs position.  The newspaper reported that Arabs, 
in particular the Palestinians, are uncomfortable about Clinton. 
Yesterday HaQaretz reported that Jones wants a NATO force to operate 
in the West Bank. 
 
HaQaretz and Makor Rishon-Hatzofe quoted former IDF chief of staff 
Moshe Ya'alon as saying in an interview with The Sydney Morning 
Herald this week that the West must consider all options necessary 
to stop Tehran's nuclear program, including assassinating Iranian 
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  HaQaretzQs web site quoted an 
associate of Ya'alon as saying that his comments were taken out of 
context. 
 
Yesterday The Jerusalem Post cited IsraelQs concern that the U.S. 
will supply tanks to Lebanon. 
 
The media reported that over the weekend three Qassam rockets landed 
near Ashkelon. 
 
Yediot and The Jerusalem Post reported that several political 
consultants involved in Barak ObamaQs election campaign are coming 
to Israeli to work for Meretz and Likud. 
 
Over the weekend the media reported on the execution by hanging of 
QIsraeli spyQ Ali Ashtari in Tehran, which The Jerusalem Post views 
as a warning to Iranian citizens.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
Defense commentator Amir Oren wrote in the independent, left-leaning 
Ha'aretz: QObama or Bibi [Netanyahu] -- that is what Scowcroft and 
Brzezinski are indirectly asking, in calling on Obama to immediately 
act in challenging the Israeli public to take a position.  They are 
right: It is still not too late to restore what Olmert has 
destroyed. 
 
Zalman Shoval, a senior Likud member and former ambassador to the 
U.S., wrote in the independent Israel Hayom: QThe new president 
might open ... to new ideas, such as Qeconomic peaceQ with the 
Palestinians, which Netanyahu mentioned to him. 
 
Dov Weisglass, who was former prime minister Ariel Sharon's top 
diplomatic advisor, wrote in the mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot: QThe mitigating circumstances that existed [at the time of 
disengagement] are no longer in force.  It is difficult to believe 
that the new administration in Washington will be more patient and 
considerate than its predecessor. 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Herb Keinon wrote in the conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post: QWhat does make ... sense is to get 
recognition now -Q at a time when Iran is marching with 
determination toward the nuclear threshold Q- of a U.S. commitment 
to back IsraelQs right to defend itself Qby itself against any 
threat or possible combination of threats. 
 
Oslo Accords architect Dr. Ron Pundak wrote in Yediot Aharonot: 
QTime is running out and that is why we need to promote as quickly 
as possible a double initiative to advance an agreement between 
Israel and the Palestinians and between Israel and Syria.... 
Achieving a Middle East of that kind is a clear American interest.

Â¶I.  "Obama or Bibi?" 
 
Defense commentator Amir Oren wrote in the independent, left-leaning 
Ha'aretz (11/24): QOlmert's visit with George W. Bush this week has 
no significance from a diplomatic and security standpoint.  Both 
leaders are tasked solely with overseeing a smooth transition 
without any authority to obligate the next administrations to do 
anything. Bush's sway over Barack Obama's administration and 
Congress is next to zero.... [Conversely], The Scowcroft-Brzezinski] 
plan is an updated version of UN Security Council Resolution 242, 
which offers land for peace.... This is a realistic, even superb, 
plan because it is QAmericanQ and not QArab.Q  It is acceptable to 
an overwhelming majority in Israel, save for the settlers and their 
supporters (and, on the other side, Hamas).  If a Livni-Barak 
government were to arise, it would have the strength to cooperate 
with an Obama-Clinton administration so as to move in this 
direction. Kadima, Labor, and Meretz could adopt the four-point 
plan, which the Likud, in its current composition of 
Bibi-Benny-Bogey (Netanyahu, Begin and Ya'alon) cannot do.  Obama or 
Bibi [Netanyahu] -- that is what Scowcroft and Brzezinski are 
indirectly asking, in calling on Obama to immediately act in 
challenging the Israeli public to take a position.  They are right: 
It is still not too late to restore what Olmert has destroyed. 
 
II.  "Chemistry between the Israeli PM and the President" 
 
Zalman Shoval, a senior Likud member and former ambassador to the 
U.S., wrote in the independent Israel Hayom (11/24): QJudging from 
messages emanating from ObamaQs entourage, his natural preference 
will be to with the economy, and, regarding foreign relations, Iraq, 
Iran, and Afghanistan.... The new president might open ... to new 
ideas, such as Qeconomic peaceQ with the Palestinians, which 
Netanyahu mentioned to him at a meeting in Jerusalem (figures around 
Obama have testified that he was impressed by them). 
 
III.  "America against the Settlements" 
 
Dov Weisglass, who was former prime minister Ariel Sharon's top 
diplomatic advisor, wrote in the mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot 
Aharonot (11/24): QThe American recognition of the Israeli demand 
for control of the large blocs and their continued development was 
accompanied by a demand that Israel refrain from any settlement 
activity in the areas outside the blocs.  In the administration's 
opinion, Israel would leave [these areas] as part of the final 
status arrangements with the Palestinians, and it is forbidden to 
build there and change the land reality.  It was the disengagement 
plan that prevented a public, severe crisis on the matter.  The 
administration was impressed by the Israeli initiative, its leaders 
placed their trust in Sharon, believed his statement that in the 
final status arrangements Israel would withdraw from the territories 
that had been occupied, and deeply appreciated his ability to keep 
his word.  The mitigating circumstances that existed then are no 
longer in force.  It is difficult to believe that the new 
administration in Washington will be more patient and considerate 
than its predecessor.  Israel will be called upon to uphold its 
commitments immediately, and if it continues to drag its feet, this 
 
will lead to a severe diplomatic entanglement. 
 
IV.  "Looking for Meaning in OlmertQs Last U.S. Trip" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Herb Keinon wrote in the conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post (11/24): QIt makes little sense that 
Olmert went to the U.S. now in the midst of an economic meltdown of 
humongous proportions to talk about the $30 million in military aid. 
 It also makes little sense that he went to get Bush to sign on once 
again on the [2004] letter, especially after Olmert may have diluted 
the content of the letter by his declaration of a willingness to 
return almost fully to the 1967 lines.  But what does make more than 
a little more than sense is to get recognition now -Q at a time when 
Iran is marching with determination toward the nuclear threshold Q- 
of a U.S. commitment to back IsraelQs right to defend itself Qby 
itself against any threat or possible combination of threats. 
 
Â¶V.  QMr. President 
 
Oslo Accords architect Dr. Ron Pundak wrote in Yediot Aharonot 
(11/23): QAmerican friends of mine tell me that the chance that the 
new administration will do anything to promote the peace process in 
the Middle East is small given that it has so many other urgent 
problems to deal with. But we can only 
say: Yes you can.... Perhaps it would be best were you to begin by 
pushing an initiative with Syria. There will be those who say to 
you, among the Israeli leadership as well, that it would be best to 
wait with the Syrians, whose interests are not clear and who will 
not forego their dangerous relationship with Iran.  But in the 
existing regional reality there can be no peace without Syria.  And 
the formula for peace has been waiting merely to be signed since 
Â¶2000.  Syria can be a constructive force or a destructive force and, 
therefore, it must not be left isolated and threatened.  Having it 
join the circle of peace is likely to weaken the Iranians' ability 
to meddle in Lebanon and Gaza.... Time is running out and that is 
why we need to promote as quickly as possible a double initiative to 
advance an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians and between 
Israel and Syria.... A double agreement of that sort would 
constitute, for all intents and purposes, the realization of 
Israel's historic aspiration, which is anchored in the Arab League 
initiative: an end of the Israeli-Arab conflict and the 
establishment of Qnormal relationsQ between all 22 members of the 
Arab League and Israel.  Achieving a Middle East of that kind is a 
clear American interest.  The dangerous tension between Iran and 
Israel can also be reduced by means of promoting a regional peace 
process.... A majority of the Israeli public wants peace and is 
prepared to pay the price that is known to all.  The problem is a 
lack of trust and the dreadful sense of being under permanent 
threat, both as individuals and as a collective.  There will be no 
Israeli willingness to make concessions to the Palestinians and the 
Syrians without the sense that the world is standing by our side. 
That is a matter of public opinion, but who better than you knows 
that without supportive public opinion it is very hard to take the 
lead on change.
