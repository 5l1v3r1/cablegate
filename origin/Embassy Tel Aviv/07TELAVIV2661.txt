     ¶B. JOUBERT-LIN-KEAYS E-MAIL OF 8/30/07 
 
¶1. (SBU) Acting on instructions in ref A, Embassy Tel Aviv 
Blue Lantern Officer conducted a site visit to IAI Elta 
Systems, Limited's office in Ashdod on August 6 to determine 
the status of 20 cable assemblies delivered to Israel.  Blue 
Lantern Officer determined that IAI Elta Systems received the 
20 cable assemblies, and that they are being used for the 
purpose stated on the license.  Specific details follow. 
 
¶A. Blue Lantern Officer met with the following Elta Systems 
employees: 
 
-- Yacob Saraf, Deputy General Manager, Elta IMINT and Radar 
Division 
 
-- Orly Araza, Head of Security Department 
 
-- Shlomo Meshulam, Deputy Security Director and Information 
Security Manager 
 
Colonel Kobi Fogelman from the Israeli MOD's Directorate for 
Security (MALMAB/DSDE) was also on site and played a 
significant role in organizing the site visit. 
 
¶B. During the site visit, Blue Lantern Officer: 
 
-- was shown a DSP-5 License dated June 30, 2006 and signed 
by Timothy J. Ruthemeyer.  The country of destination listed 
on the document is India, and the Foreign End User listed is 
the Indian Navy.  The license value listed was USD 34,068.00. 
 
-- was told that the 20 cable assemblies were received from 
the U.S. in six different shipments.  The cable assemblies 
are being incorporated into Type EL/M-2032 Airborne Radar 
Systems which constitute the fire control radar for the 
Indian Navy's Sea Harrier.  The cable assemblies work as 
high-voltage connectors for tubes that provide power to the 
radar system's transmitter. 
 
-- was shown the original letter from the Indian Navy 
concerning the four Type EL/M-2032 Airborne Radar Systems 
(including four of the cable assemblies) that it had already 
received.  (NOTE:  These have the Elta serial numbers IN104, 
IN204, IN102 and IN201.  END NOTE.) 
 
-- was shown seventeen (17) of the cable assemblies in 
various configurations.  Of these, Blue Lantern Officer was 
informed that three (3) were currently assigned to the 
assembly line.  Two (2) of the cable assemblies had already 
been fitted into tubes (with Elta serial numbers IN205 and 
IN206) and were ready for shipment.  One of the assemblies 
had been fitted into a replaceable part of the transmitter 
(known as an SRU).  Two (2) others remain at the first stage 
of the assembly process. 
 
-- was informed that four (4) of the assemblies had already 
been delivered to the Indian Navy.  One (1) was returned for 
repairs, so Elta is now in possession of seventeen (17) of 
the assemblies.  (NOTE:  The one assembly returned for 
repairs was already fitted into a complete transmitter unit. 
The Elta serial number on it is IN201.  END NOTE.) 
 
-- was shown the eight (8) remaining cable assemblies in 
storage, with end-user stickers on them that indicated that 
they are only to be used for the EL/M-2032 project.  The 
stickers noted that they are controlled items. 
 
-- was told that two of the assemblies, and the repaired 
assembly, would be sent to India in August.  It would take 
some time for the remaining assemblies to be fitted into 
their final components and shipped to India.  Blue Lantern 
Officer was told that it takes six months to manufacture an 
entire component. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Blue Lantern Officer has sent by FAX to PM/DTCC (FAX 
number 202-261-8198) ten pages of documentation, including a 
copy of the DSP-5, a copy of the letter from the Indian Navy, 
and a chart showing the disposition of the 20 cable 
assemblies. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Blue Lantern Officer received a general briefing on 
Elta Systems, Ltd.  The company is owned by Israel Aircraft 
Industries (IAI).  Its president is Mr. Nissim Hadas.  Elta 
 
Systems, Ltd. is comprised of several divisions, including 
IMINT and Radar, SIGINT, Airborne Early Warning (AEW),

marine patrol radar for the U.S. Coast Guard.  There are 
3,000 workers at Elta Systems, Ltd.'s complex in Ashdod.
