¶1. (U) Israel Radio reported at 1200 on Friday, June 30 that 
IDF soldiers killed a Sudanese national in the course of his 
arrest.  He was reportedly in the company of nine other 
Sudanese, three residents of the Gaza Strip, and three "call 
girls from Russia."  The IDF shot the Sudanese national, 
according to Israel Radio, after he fled the vehicle 
containing all sixteen illegal migrants. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Official GOI Anti-Trafficking Coordinator Rachel 
Gershuni confirmed the press report to poloff July 3, and 
said that two of the women came from Moldova, and one from 
the Sudan.  Gershuni said that the head of the crime unit in 
the Immigration Administration, Ziva Agami Cohen, informed 
her that the two Moldovan women were transferred immediately 
to Tsohar detention center in the south of Israel, where they 
were offered the option of immediate transfer to the shelter 
in Tel Aviv for trafficking victims.  Ziva Agami Cohen 
confirmed these details to poloff on July 5, adding that the 
two women elected to go to the shelter and were transported 
there within 24 hours of their June 30 apprehension.  Cohen 
said that the two Moldovan women appeared to be trafficking 
victims, but that the Sudanese woman did not.  She said that 
the Sudanese woman formed part of a recent wave of asylum 
seekers traveling to Israel from Sudan via Egypt.  (Note: 
Cohen also reported that a formal policy has been agreed 
between the Immigration Administration and the Israeli Border 
Police that, in the future, all suspected trafficking victims 
will be sent directly to the shelter, without stopping first 
at a detention center.  End note.)
