OCCUPIED TERRITORIES 
 
¶1.  (SBU) ICRC Head of Delegation Dominik Stillhart told the 
Ambassador April 4 that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
cannot avert a looming humanitarian crisis in the Occupied 
Territories.  He emphasized that NGOs do not have the 
resources or capacity to assume the functions of government, 
such as paying salaries to what he said are the 140,000 
employees of the Palestinian Authority (PA).  Even if NGOs 
and intergovernmental organizations dramatically increase the 
aid that they currently provide, Stillhart said, "we cannot 
prevent a humanitarian crisis if we do not find other 
mechanisms to ensure that salaries get paid."  Stillhart 
predicted that security officials and health workers will 
eventually stop working if they do not receive their 
salaries.  Without security, Stillhart stressed, NGOs will no 
longer provide any services.

"ISRAEL IS STILL AN OCCUPYING POWER IN GAZA" 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to international humanitarian law, 
Stillhart said, the GOI retains responsibility for the 
welfare of residents of the Gaza Strip.  "The ICRC still 
considers Israel an occupying power in Gaza," he said.  He 
explained that Israel controls Gaza's sea and air space, all 
crossings except Rafah, as well as water, electricity and 
other basis necessities. 
 
-------------------------- 
ICRC CAN INCREASE ITS ROLE 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Should the situation deteriorate, Stillhart said, 
the ICRC can increase its support for delivery of basic food 
and health services, but not enough to take care of 
humanitarian needs.  ICRC can absorb up to an additional $40 
million, according to Stillhart, which would double its 
current annual budget for Israel and the Occupied 
Territories.
