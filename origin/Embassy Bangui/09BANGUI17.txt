¶1. (U) UN efforts regarding sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) 
and trafficking in persons (TIP) in MINURCAT in the Central 
African Republic (CAR) have been limited but effective. MINURCAT 
currently operates with only several staff persons in an office 
in Bangui. It has worked to prevent and respond to SEA and TIP 
in its area of responsibility in CAR. 
 
¶2. (U) Neither the CAR authorities nor civil society groups have 
raised issues related to SEA or TIP in MINURCAT operations.  No 
international organizations or non-governmental organizations 
have raised SEA or TIP issues in MINURCAT. There has been no 
mention in the CAR press of issues related to SEA and or TIP in 
MINURCAT. 
 
¶3. (U) Ambassador Cook has discussed TIP issues actively with 
all parts of the CAR's Government, including with the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs and with the UN SRSYG Francois Fall. There is 
broad agreement on the need to combat TIP and SEA, both within 
MINURCAT and in society as a whole.
