ALBRIGHT ON DARFUR, SOMALIA, ERITREA 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  While visiting Addis Ababa to promote the 
UNDP's Commission for the Legal Empowerment of the Poor, 
former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Prime 
Minister Meles Zenawi December 1 to discuss Ethiopia's 
support of the Commission and her concern about the 
deteriorating situations in Darfur and Somalia.  Meles said 
that Bashir would continue his defiance of the international 
community because he feared the U.S. ultimately wanted regime 
change in Sudan.  Meles recommended that the U.S. re-engage 
in Darfur as a partner in the dialogue between the GOS and 
rebels.  With regard to Somalia, Meles said that dialogue was 
"improbable" and that limited military action to "divorce" 
the jihadists from the CIC was more likely.  Eritrea, Meles 
contended, was not interested in resolving its border 
conflict with Ethiopia and has started a proxy war through 
Somalia.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, 
accompanied by the Albright Group's Manager of Communications 
Jamie Smith, met with Prime Minister Meles December 1 during 
a two-day visit to Ethiopia.  Ambassador Yamamoto and poloff 
(notetaker) also accompanied the Secretary.  Meles was joined 
by MFA Acting Director for Europe and the Americas Almaz Amha 
and the Personal Assistant to the Prime Minister Gebretensai 
Gebremichael. 
 
DARFUR 
------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) Secretary Albright spoke briefly about her role as 
co-chair of the Commission for the Legal Empowerment of the 
Poor and gained the Prime Minister's support for the 
Commission's work in Ethiopia.  Albright moved quickly on to 
other matters of substance, including Darfur.  Albright said 
that the American public was "at a loss" for what's going on 
in Darfur and pointedly asked Meles what he thought about 
Sudanese President Bashir.  Meles cited two reasons for 
Bashir's continued defiance of the United Nations takeover of 
the AU mission: first, Bashir believes that any sanctions 
imposed by the international community would hurt Southern 
Sudan groups; and second, Bashir is convinced that the U.S. 
only wants "regime change" in Sudan.  Meles said that Bashir 
plans to preempt a UN force by bringing the rebel groups 
together with the assistance of Eritrea and Libya.  Eritrea, 
Meles contended, has influence over eastern Sudanese rebel 
groups and would be willing to help Sudan with the proper 
"compensation," including oil and normalized relations with 
Sudan.  Meles said that a byproduct of the Sudan/Eritrea 
cooperation would be a possible rift in Sudan/Ethiopia 
relations. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Meles suggested that the U.S. back away from any 
regime change ideas in Sudan, economic sanctions or military 
action and focus on playing a constructive role in 
negotiations between the rebels and GOS.  The PM added that 
the U.S. would need to help implement any agreements that 
result from dialogue.  Meles noted that Egypt plays a 
substantial role in the region and the U.S. might think about 
engaging the country further on the issue.  Meles said that 
the U.S. must understand that Darfur is a "waiting game" and 
there are not any quick solutions. 
 
SOMALIA 
------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Albright reminded the Prime Minister that she was a 
private citizen (and not a USG representative) and lamented 
that Somalia was once again at the forefront of American 
foreign policy.  Albright asked what Meles thought of the 
current situation in Somalia and about Ethiopia's intentions. 
 Meles said that there was a window of opportunity a year ago 
when the TFG was established.  At that time, Meles added, the 
Islamists were contained to small areas in the country and 
the TFG wanted to establish law and order.  Meles quipped 
that the U.S. was "not of the same mind" and preferred to 
seek out terrorists rather than focus on strengthening the 
TFG.  Now, Meles said, jihadists have a seemingly unstoppable 
momentum and have nearly completed their takeover of the 
country. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Meles indicated that there are only three areas of 
Somalia not under CIC control:  Baidoa, Somaliland, and 
Puntland.  Ethiopia's possible intervention is the only 
reason the entire country has not collapsed into CIC hands, 
said Meles.  Meles told Albright that the U.S. understands 
someone must stop the CIC and does not oppose Ethiopian

action to protect its national security, but worries that 
Ethiopia will get "stuck."  The EU, Meles added, is "more 
ambivalent" than the U.S.  Meles acknowledged that dialogue 
was the best solution to the problem, but said it was 
"improbable" that the CIC would engage in dialogue.  Meles 
said that the CIC needed to be divided from the jihadists and 
that limited military action might precipitate this 
"divorce." 
 
Eritrea 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Albright asked whether Ethiopia was getting bogged 
down having to deal with the "Talibanization" of Somalia and 
the ongoing conflict with Eritrea.  Meles added that, at the 
moment, there was no threat of military conflict with Eritrea 
in the north.  Ethiopia, he said, was prepared to move 
forward with demarcation of the border via a broader dialogue 
with Eritrea, but noted that Eritrea was not interested in 
dialogue.  Meles said Eritrea's solution to the border 
conflict was to use Somalia to conduct a proxy war.  Meles 
told Albright that Eritrea was receiving money from Qatar, 
United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to fund jihadist 
activities in Somalia.  He noted that Yemen, however, was a 
friend to Ethiopia and playing a constructive role. 
 
NDI 
--- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Albright briefly mentioned how she was disappointed 
about the National Democratic Institute's (NDI) expulsion 
from the country last year and asked how the organization 
might again operate in Ethiopia.  Meles said it was a 
"unfortunate decision" to expel NDI and there were 
"misunderstandings" on both sides.  Meles indicated he was 
prepared to work on the GOE's relationship with NDI.
