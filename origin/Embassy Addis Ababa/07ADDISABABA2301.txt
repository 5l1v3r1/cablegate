¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Since the March arrest of a Ghanaian 
national who had ingested nearly one kilogram of heroin from 
Iran, Ethiopian federal authorities have arrested 4 other 
Africans transiting Addis Ababa from Dubai with ingested 
heroin, and are randomly searching West Africans on suspect 
flights.  The suspected smugglers claimed to have purchased 
the heroin pellets in Iran or Dubai.  While Ethiopia is not a 
significant producer, trafficker, or consumer of narcotic 
drugs, its location among the major narcotics routes--linking 
Southeast/Southwest Asian heroin production, European 
markets, and West African trafficking networks--make it a 
prime candidate for continued drug trafficking.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ethiopian Federal Police Illicit Drug Control 
Service Deputy Commander Tsegaye Weldhiwot reported that 
Ghanaian National Francis Antwi (DOB 12 March 1979) was 
arrested at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport on June 
¶16.  Mr. Antwi swallowed 30 pellets of heroin, weighing 
391.15 grams.  Mr. Antwi, who traveled from Tehran to Dubai, 
claimed that he purchased the drugs in Iran for USD7,500 from 
Mr. Farmod, an Emirati citizen.  Mr. Antwi claimed that he 
did not know the identity of the final purchaser of the 
heroin; however, his destination was Lome, Togo.  Ten days 
later, on June 26, a second Ghanaian citizen, Godstime Vinson 
Badasu (DOB 03 April 1957) was arrested for trafficking of 
heroin, also in the form of swallowed pellets.  Mr. Badasu 
expelled 16 pellets, obtained the drugs in Dubai, and was 
also traveling to a final destination of Lome, Togo.

KENYAN AND TANZANIAN CITIZENS ARRESTED FOR TRAFFICKING HEROIN

¶3. (SBU) In addition to the Ghanaian citizens, on June 29, 
Ethiopian Federal Police Illicit Drug Control Service 
officers arrested Kenyan citizen Adamal Harun Mansur (DOB 03 
February 1984).  Mr. Mansur was found carrying 17 capsules of 
heroin internally, and was traveling from Dubai to Lilongwe, 
Malawi, transiting Bole International Airport.  On July 1, 
the Ethiopian Federal Police arrested Tanzanian citizen Johar 
Saleh Athumani (DOB 17 April 1973).  Mr. Athumani was 
traveling from Dubai to Kilimanjaro International Airport in 
Tanzania, also transiting through Addis Ababa.  Mr. Athumani 
expelled six capsules of heroin.

FEDERAL POLICE SEARCHING SUSPECTED WEST AFRICAN NATIONALS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) These instances of trafficking follow close on the 
heels of the March 23 arrest of Ghanaian national Abubakari 
Yakubu (DOB: 23 January 1972) for possession of heroin at 
Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa (ref A).  The 
Ethiopian Federal Police responded to this apparent increase 
of narcotics trafficking by West African nationals by 
randomly searching a West African citizen on every suspect 
flight.  With regard to narcotics trafficking by all 
nationalities, the penalty for narcotics trafficking in 
Ethiopia increased one year ago from a maximum of three years 
to a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.  Thus far, the average 
sentence has been 3-4 years.  The authorities in Dubai did 
not arrest the suspected traffickers passing through their 
airports; however, Emirati officials notified Ethiopian 
authorities of the alleged traffickers once they departed 
 
ADDIS ABAB 00002301  002 OF 002 
 
 
Dubai and were en route to Addis Ababa.

ETHIOPIA NOT LIKELY A HUB FOR EXCESSIVE DRUG TRAFFICKING 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  It was unclear whether the Ethiopian 
police had made contact with the respective embassies of 
those arrested, in order to ensure consular access.  As noted 
in Ethiopia's 2006 International Narcotics Control Strategy 
Report (INCSR) (ref B), Post assesses that Ethiopia is not, 
nor is it likely to become, a significant producer, 
trafficker, or consumer of narcotic drugs.  However, its 
location among the major narcotics routes between 
Southeast/Southwest Asian heroin production, European 
markets, and West African trafficking networks, make it a 
prime candidate for continued drug trafficking.  For example, 
Ethiopian Federal Police report having confiscated 11 kg, 
312.76 grams of heroin from 14 individuals in 2005, and 16 
kg, 165.98 grams of heroin from 22 individuals in 2004.  END
