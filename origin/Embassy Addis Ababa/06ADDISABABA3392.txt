SUBJECT: ADDIS ABABA EAC REVIEWS SECURITY SITUATION AFTER ETHIOPIAN 
MILITARY ACTION IN SOMALIA 
 
¶1.  (U) On December 26, the Emergency Action Committee (EAC) met to 
review the general security situation in Ethiopia as well as post's 
general security posture.  The following offices were represented at 
the EAC: Charge, A/DCM, PE, DATT, USAID, USAU, CONS, RMO, ORA, CDC, 
MGT, GSO, A/PAO, MSG and RSO. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The EAC discussed the following issues: 
 
-- The ongoing situation between Ethiopia and Somalia; 
 
-- Related security concerns, including the general security 
situation within Addis Ababa and the rest of Ethiopia. 
 
¶3.  (U) Between December 24-26, the Government of Ethiopia (GOE) 
publicly acknowledged (septel) sustained military operations in 
Somalia against extreme elements of the Council of Islamic Courts 
(CIC). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The general consensus of the EAC was that it was too early 
to determine possible fallout/impact of these events as it pertains 
to the general security situation within Addis Ababa and the rest of 
Ethiopia.  Based on a review of relevant tripwires, and the lack of 
any security incidents associated with the GOE's recent 
announcement, the EAC decided against issuing a general travel 
warning advising against travel to Ethiopia.  The current situation 
in Addis Ababa remains normal and permissive. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The EAC approved the preparation of a general warden 
message for approval by the Department, advising the public of 
Ethiopian military operations along the border and in Somalia, and 
repeating cautionary information from the Consular Information 
Sheet. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The RSO will carefully examine our already strong security 
posture, and make any necessary adjustments accordingly.  In the 
coming days, we hope to begin work on extensive physical security 
improvements to the highly visible and accessed gate to the Embassy 
compound. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The EAC agreed to meet and review the security situation 
again before the New Year holiday as necessary.  Developments will 
be reported accordingly.
