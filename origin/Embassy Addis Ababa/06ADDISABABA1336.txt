REF: A. STATE 75873 (NOTAL) 
     ¶B. DHANANI-WILGUS EMAIL OF MAY 12 2006 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The African Union Commission anticipates 
that the upcoming May 15 AU Peace and Security Council 
meeting will address the implementation of the previous March 
PSC on AMIS transition, but will not discuss a new CONOPs for 
AMIS.  Separately, Gabon notes that it only learned of the 
PSC today, and has yet to receive an agenda.  Thus, Gabon 
believes the PSC will not make any significant new decisions 
and will simply endorse the decisions taken in March.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On May 12, DCM, accompanied by deputy pol-econ 
counselor, presented reftel points on the upcoming May 15 
African Union Peace and Security Council (PSC) to Amb. John 
Kayode Shinkayie, Director of the Cabinet for AU Commission 
Chairperson Konare.  DCM also urged that Peace and Security 
Commission Amb. Said Djinnit consider briefing key partners 
on the outcome of the PSC.  (NOTE: AU Chairperson Konare was 
not available, having just returned from a visit to Europe. 
Amb. Djinnit was also traveling, due to return late on May 12 
after having led the AU delegation participating in a May 6 
AU Commission-European Commission consultation in Vienna. 
The resulting AU-EU communique, which endorses the recently 
concluded Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), has been forwared to 
AF/SPG and AF.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Shinkayie responded that the May 15 PSC would likely 
address reftel points, and that the resulting communique 
would be immediately released following the meeting.  He 
acknowledged that the previous March 10 PSC had required 
"careful language" (about transition from an AU to a UN-led 
mission in Sudan) in order to gain consensus, but said that 
the current political climate had improved enough to allow 
the Council to speak "more forthrightly." 
 
------------------------------------- 
WAHID CONTINUES DISCUSSIONS WITH IBOK 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Shinkayie added that discussions with SLA chairman 
Abdul Wahid continued in Abuja, with AU Darfur mediator Amb. 
Sam Ibok.  Shinkayie said it was possible that Wahid could 
sign the DPA, having asked for clarification of some of the 
DPA's key articles, which would leave only the JEM as 
non-signatories. 
 
------------------------------------- 
GABON HAS NOT RECEIVED AGENDA FOR PSC 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) DCM also presented reftel points earlier to Amb. 
Sahilework Zewdie, Ethiopia's representative to the AU and 
UNECA, and the MFA's Director-General for African Affairs. 
Amb. Sahilework said she was pleased with the Abuja 
agreement, and noted that implementation would be difficult. 
 
¶6. (SBU) According to Embassy Libreville (ref B), Deputy 
Minister Jean Francois Ndongou stated that Gabon only learned 
of the upcoming PSC on March 12, and had not yet received any 
agenda for the meeting.  Gabon would be represented by its 
ambassador in Addis Ababa.  As a result, he said, the PSC 
could not take any significant new steps, and will likely 
only endorse the decisions taken in March.  Ndongou stated 
that Gabon would support an AU call for UNSC sanctions 
against nonsignatory rebels. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
PSC LIKELY WILL NOT ADDRESS AMIS CONOPS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) In a May 11 briefing to U.S., Canadian, and EU 
partner representatives, AU Commission Darfur Integrated Task 
Force (AU/DITF) Military Component Head LTC Mbaye announced 
that the May 15 PSC would not/not address a new concept of 
operations (CONOPS) for the AU Mission in Sudan (AMIS). 
(NOTE: LTC Mbaye recently led a 3-person AU/DITF team to El 
Fasher; he stated that the preparation of a new CONOPS was 
his responsibility, but said it had not yet been completed 
and would likely not be completed before the May 15 PSC.  END 
NOTE.)  According to DITF Head Amb. Ki Doulaye Corentin, the 
 
ADDIS ABAB 00001336  002 OF 002 
 
 
ministerial-level PSC would likely address: 
-- implementation of the March 10 PSC; 
-- the recently concluded Abuja talks and their outcome; 
-- coordination with the UN; 
-- "robust interpretation" of AMIS's mandate in the field. 
 
¶8. (U) EU Special Representative for Sudan Pekka Haavisto 
will arrive in Addis Ababa with other EU representatives on 
May 15, according to EC contacts, for possible consultations 
on the margins of the PSC.
