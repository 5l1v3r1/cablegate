SUBJECT: CUBA AND BAHAMAS TALK SEA BORDERS 
 
(U) The GCOB recently concluded a "successful round" of preliminary 
negotiations to define maritime boundaries with Cuba, according to a 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement.  The discussions began in 
Havana June 10.  Technical experts also discussed other maritime 
legal issues in the context of sea boundary delimitation, including 
search and rescue missions, illegal trafficking of drugs and 
migrants, management of trans-boundary resources, such as fisheries 
and oil and gas, and scientific research cooperation.  A further 
round of discussions with Cuba is expected "within months". 
According to the statement, The Bahamas "will eventually pursue 
boundary negotiations" with the U.S., the United Kingdom on behalf 
of the Turks & Caicos Islands, and Haiti.
