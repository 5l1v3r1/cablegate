On October 23, Poloff delivered reftel talking points to 
Acting Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Marilyn Zonicle, leaving a non-paper.  Ms. Zonicle 
thanked Poloff for the information, but highlighted concerns 
regarding the suffering of Lebanese civilians, especially 
children.  Poloff reiterated the political nature of the 
resolution and the one-sided lack of condemnation of
