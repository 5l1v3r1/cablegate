SUBJECT: BRAZIL TO OPEN EMBASSY IN THE BAHAMAS 
 
 
¶1.  On February 1, Poloff had a chance meeting with the new 
Brazilian Ambassador to The Bahamas, Tomas Mauricio 
Guggenheim, on the street outside their homes.  Guggenheim, 
former ambassador to Gabon, said Brazil was in the process of 
opening an Embassy in The Bahamas.  He is currently searching 
for an office and "improved" housing space.  His presence 
confirms earlier rumors that Brazil was seeking to open an 
embassy here. 
 
¶2.  Guggenheim has been in Nassau since the beginning of the 
year, but said he was still waiting on the notoriously 
unreliable Bahamian protocol chief to arrange his formal 
introduction to the Government of The Bahamas.  PolChief 
confirmed with MFA that Brazil had yet to receive agrement to 
open its mission here.  In explaining Brazil's interest in 
Nassau, Guggenheim noted a growing Brazilian business 
presence in country and Brazil's expanding influence in the 
hemisphere, including Brazil's work in Haiti. 
 
¶3.  COMMENT:  Post welcomes an expanded diplomatic community 
in Nassau, currently represented only by China, Cuba, Haiti 
and the U.S.  Brazil's interest in The Bahamas certainly 
reflects Brazil's expanded role in the region as shown by its 
leadership of the multinational force in Haiti.  Brazil's 
interest in cementing support for its UN Security Council 
ambitions is certainly also factor behind the decision. 
While not mentioned by Guggenheim as a motivation for the new 
embassy, Post has noticed an uptick in Brazilian migration 
through The Bahamas -- The Bahamas may be developing as a 
more attactive route for Brazilians heading to the U.S. 
following Mexico's decision to require Brazilians toobtain 
visas to enter Mexico.  The new Braziliandiplomatic presence 
wil be useful if these migrtion trends continue and 
engagement with Brazil ecomes necessary.  END COMMENT.
