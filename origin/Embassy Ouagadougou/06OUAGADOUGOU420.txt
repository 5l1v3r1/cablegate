SUBJECT: U.S. STATEMENT ON IRAN 
 
REF: SECSTATE 87682 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  DCM presented demarche to Salifou Sawadogo, Chef 
de Cabinet of the Prime Minister.  The President and Minister 
of Foreign Affairs are both out of the country, and the Prime 
Minister is unavailable until next week.  Sawadogo took 
careful notes as DCM presented demarche, summarized the 
actions that the U.S. is seeking of the GOBF and said that he 
would relay our points to the Prime Minister. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Sawadogo made a point to comment that Burkina Faso 
is supportive of the U.S. position on large global issues. 
He observed that because Burkina is a small, impoverished 
country, issues relating to international stability are 
important to the country.  High oil prices are becoming a 
political liability for the country's leadership and as Iran 
is a major oil producer, Middle East stability and its impact 
on international oil prices resonate with the government. 
DCM said that she would follow-up with Sawodogo on Monday 
regarding the Prime Minister's reaction. 
 
¶3.   (SBU)  By chance, on May 31, the Israeli ambassador, who 
is resident in Abidjan, paid a courtesy call on the 
Ambassador.  During the course of their meeting, the Israeli 
ambassador said that he had heard that Iran was planning to 
open an embassy in Burkina Faso.  (Comment, Iran previously 
had an embassy in Ouagadougou, and post is trying to confirm 
when it closed.  End comment.)  DCM took the opportunity of 
the demarche to raise this issue with Sawodogo.  Sawodogo 
cautiously responded by saying he did not have any 
information on this and therefore could not answer the DCM,s 
question.  DCM then suggested that if the GOBF had good 
relations with Iran, the GOBF should use that relationship to 
encourage the GOI to the negotiating table.  DCM further 
commented that the international community had to be united 
in its position regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions.
