COMMITTEE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 83244 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On August 4, Amb. Wolff delivered reftel demarche 
to Russian Deputy Perm Rep Igor Shcherbak regarding Russia's 
opposition to listing six new individuals in the 1518 (Iraq) 
Sanctions Committee. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Shcherbak replied that there had been no change in 
Russia's position and that the issue remained with Moscow. 
While he claimed that Russia's current hold on adding new 
names was "technical," Shcherbak (protect) acknowledged 
privately that general feelings about 1518 and the 
individuals' links to Syria were possibly additional factors 
for Moscow.
