¶1.  (U) SUMMARY.  On April 4 Under Secretary General for 
Humanitarian Affairs John Holmes briefed the Security Council 
on his recent mission to Sudan, Chad, and the Central African 
Republic (CAR).  Despite the wide agenda topic, "Situation in 
Africa," Holmes' presentation focused on the three countries 
visited and continuing humanitarian needs.  In response to 
interventions from some members, Holmes stressed the need for 
enhanced peacekeeping efforts in Darfur, eastern Chad and 
northeastern CAR to address the urgent protection crisis and 
allow for the effective delivery of aid. 
 
¶2.  (U) Security Council members welcomed Holmes to his first 
appearance in the Security Council since taking office in 
March.  None expressed disagreement with his analysis of the 
situation and some made explicit calls for the immediate 
deployment of the UN-African Union (AU) hybrid force to 
Darfur to bolster peacekeeping efforts and provide protection 
to civilians.  UK, as Security Council President, expressed 
the Council's gratitude and support for the work being done 
by UN and other humanitarian agencies in Darfur.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------- 
Limited response in CAR 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Holmes briefly described the current crisis in 
northeastern CAR, including difficulty in reaching displaced 
populations that are scattered in the forest and traumatized 
by recent violence.  Holmes reported that the government 
currently provides no services in the area and that 
international response to date has been insufficient.  He 
called for additional resources, noting that the CAR 
humanitarian appeal is only 18 per cent funded, and made a 
plea for additional partners to work with the UN in 
addressing humanitarian needs in CAR.  (Note:  Holmes 
reported the following day to the Humanitarian Liaison 
Working Group that the CAR appeal is actually 28 per cent 
funded.  End note.) 
 
------------------------------- 
Increasing displacement in Chad 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Holmes emphasized that the protection concerns raised 
during the Security Council visit to Chad in June 2006 remain 
largely unaddressed.  The security situation has deteriorated 
significantly in the past year and displacement of both 
Sudanese refugees and Chadian IDPs in the eastern region 
continues to rise.  Holmes expressed concern about the 
growing militarization of refugee camps and IDP locations in 
eastern Chad, stressing that international peacekeeping is 
essential to preventing a further deterioration and providing 
minimum protection to civilians.  In response to a question, 
Holmes noted the imminent release of a UN 90-day humanitarian 
plan of action for Chad. 
 
----------------------------- 
Darfur "increasingly fragile" 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) Holmes opened his discussion on Sudan by reminding 
that former-U/SYG Jan Egeland first briefed the Security 
Council three years ago on the situation in Darfur.  Those 
affected by the conflict in 2004 are still displaced, and the 
impact on civilian populations has grown worse.  An 
additional 250,000 people were displaced in the three states 
of Darfur in the last six months, many of whom have settled 
in camps that were already at full capacity. 
 
¶6.  (U) Holmes praised international efforts since 2004 that 
helped stabilize the humanitarian situation.  However, he 
stressed that access to populations in need is increasingly 
limited by insecurity, creating a growing number of people 
out of reach to the international aid effort. 
 
¶7.  (U) Holmes contrasted the success in addressing 
humanitarian needs to the fundamental failure to protect 
 
USUN NEW Y 00000269  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
civilian populations in Darfur from violence.  Holmes noted 
that all parties in the conflict are responsible for the 
current protection crisis, but he emphasized that the 
Government of Sudan (GOS) has the primary responsibility for 
the protection of its people and that it is "accountable for 
the proper investigation and prosecution of those accused of 
committing crimes." 
 
¶8.  (U) Holmes expressed strong concern over the targeting 
and abuse of aid workers in Darfur.  He reported that he had 
pressed the GOS to drop all charges in the Nyala incident, 
but recent news of court summons suggests the legal case is 
proceeding. During his visit Holmes also stressed to the GOS 
that it is within the mandate of humanitarian NGOs to speak 
out about violations of humanitarian law, stating that he 
expects the "insidious pressure" on humanitarian agencies to 
cease. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Support and skepticism on Joint Communiqu 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶9.  (U) Searching for a positive note on Darfur, Holmes 
praised the March 28 Joint Communiqu between the GOS and the 
UN to alleviate bureaucratic restrictions on humanitarian 
operations.  He highlighted the role of the high-level 
oversight committee, expected to meet monthly in Khartoum, in 
tracking the implementation of the agreement. 
 
¶10.  Despite the unanimous welcome of the communiqu by 
Security Council members, many expressed skepticism that it 
will be fully implemented.  Holmes reiterated his call for 
strong participation in the oversight committee by Security 
Council members through representatives in Khartoum, noting 
the useful work done by donors on the margins of the Sudan 
Consortium in March to set the groundwork for the agreement. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Southern Sudan focus on recovery 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  (U) In Juba Holmes met with Government of Southern Sudan 
(GOSS) officials and reviewed the implementation of the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).  He called on the 
Security Council to ensure that the Darfur does not distract 
for the fundamental importance of the CPA and the 
rehabilitation of the South. 
 
¶12.  (U) Holmes reported that due to lessening acute 
humanitarian needs in southern Sudan, OCHA will "centralize" 
its operations in Juba and reduce the number of field offices 
in southern Sudan.  He called on UN development actors to 
"step to the plate" for longer-term recovery and development 
requirements. 
 
¶13.  (U) Holmes praised efforts by Special Envoy Chissano to 
restart negotiations between the Lord's Resistance Army and 
the Government of Uganda.  The UN Office for the Coordination 
of Humanitarian Affairs, in conjunction with the UN 
Department of Political Affairs, will continue to support 
these efforts through the Juba Initiative Project.  (Note: 
Holmes' predecessor, Jan Egeland, was personally involved in 
this reconciliation process, but it remains to be seen if 
Holmes will be as directly engaged.  End note.) 
 
------------------------------- 
Limited agreement on next steps 
------------------------------- 
 
¶14.  (U) Ambassador Sanders stressed USG concerns over 
worsening humanitarian indicators in Darfur and increasing 
levels of violence, including the targeting of civilians and 
relief workers.  Sanders called for the UN to finalize with 
the Government of Chad modalities on a peacekeeping force in 
eastern Chad.  Welcoming the recent conversations between the 
SYG and President Bashir affirming the GOS' commitment to the 
consensus reached on November 16, 2006 in Addis Ababa, 
 
USUN NEW Y 00000269  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
Ambassador Sanders called on the GOS to honor its commitments 
and facilitate the implementation of the agreed upon 
framework, including the deployment of a hybrid UN-AU 
peacekeeping force to Darfur. Sanders also reiterated USG 
support for recovery and development in southern Sudan, 
recognizing the vital role of international organizations in 
facilitating the large-scale return of refugees and 
internally displaced persons to and within the South. 
 
¶15.  (U) Security Council members expressed general agreement 
on Holmes' depiction of the humanitarian situation in Darfur, 
Chad and CAR, as well as recognition that the crises are 
interconnected.  Many members stressed the need for enhanced 
peacekeeping efforts in the region.  Belgium, Slovakia, 
Russia, France, the US, and the UK called explicitly for a UN 
force in Darfur to augment AU efforts. 
 
¶16.  (U) Qatar and Indonesia highlighted the recent 
"positive" meeting between President Bashir and SYG Ban on 
the margins of the Arab League Summit in Riyadh and stressed 
that the responsibility to protect civilians lay 
fundamentally with the states involved.  France reiterated 
that the Security Council is awaiting confirmation that the 
GOS will implement the commitments made in Addis Ababa in 
November 2006.  (Note:  The SYG briefed the Security Council 
on April 5 on his meeting with President Bashir in Riyadh, to 
be reported septel.  End note.) 
 
¶17.  (U) Many members expressed support for UN and AU 
mediation efforts for Darfur.  In response to a question 
about his opinion on the political initiative of the UN and 
AU special envoys, Holmes noted that it is clear that the 
search for a political solution to the crisis in Darfur must 
proceed in parallel to strengthened peacekeeping and 
continuing humanitarian efforts.
