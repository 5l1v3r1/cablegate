SUBJECT: UNSC: SECURITY COUNCIL RENEWS MINURSO FOR SIX 
MONTHS 
 
REF: STATE 180405 
 
¶1.   The Security Council October 31 extended the MINURSO 
(United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) 
mandate for a further six months to April 30, 2007.  UNSCR 
1720 (2006), based on a draft text developed and sponsored by 
Friends of Western Sahara (U.S., UK, France, Russia and 
Spain), passed by a 15-0 vote.  With the exception of a new 
preambular paragraph expressing support for the efforts of 
the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy, the text 
closely tracked the text of the April 2006 renewal resolution. 
 
¶2.  Three Council members -- U.S., UK and France -- delivered 
explanations of vote (EOVs).  Speaking first, U.S. Political 
Minister-Counselor Brencick said that the United States voted 
for the resolution with the understanding that all parties 
would utilize the coming six months to aggressively negotiate 
a mutually acceptable solution that brings peace, stability 
and economic prosperity to the region in a manner consistent 
with the principle of self-determination for the people of 
Western Sahara.  The United States further called for all 
parties to engage the UN and each other in a spirit of 
flexibility and compromise.  We urged Morocco to move quickly 
to fulfill its many promises to table a comprehensive and 
credible autonomy proposal for the Western Sahara, and to 
engage in discussions, without preconditions, with all 
Sahrawi people, including the Polisario.  In calling for 
Morocco, Algeria and the Polisario to move beyond rhetoric to 
the serious work needed for resolution of this conflict, 
Brencick conveyed the U.S. view that MINURSO is not a viable 
alternative to a permanent solution.  Finally, Brencick 
relayed the U.S. request to the Secretary-General to examine 
mechanisms and a timetable for dismantlement of MINURSO 
should it continue to prove ineffective in fulfilling its 
mandate, or should the parties prove unable to make 
substantial progress towards a political solution. 
 
¶3.  In its EOV, UK DPR Pierce, noting that the resolution was 
a technical rollover, highlighted three aspects of the 
Western Sahara situation the UK considers to be important: 
the efforts of the Secretary-General and the Personal Envoy 
to find a way forward; the reference to the human rights 
situation in the Secretary-General's report, a reference 
which calls for continuing monitoring of human rights in 
Western Sahara; and a reiteration of the UK's desire to see 
progress beyond the current impasse in the next six months. 
In its EOV, France noted positively Morocco's intention to 
submit an autonomy proposal in the coming months and 
expressed its support for the work of the Secretary-General 
and the Personal Envoy. 
 
¶4.  Text of UNSC resolution 1720 follows: 
Begin Text: 
The Security Council, 
 
Recalling all its previous resolutions on Western Sahara, 
including resolution 1495 (2003) of 31 July 2003, resolution 
1541 (2004) of 29 April 2004, and resolution 1675 (2006) of 
28 April 2006. 
 
Reaffirming its strong support for the efforts of the 
Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy; 
 
SIPDIS 
 
Reaffirming its commitment to assist the parties to achieve a 
just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution, 
which will provide for the self-determination of the people 
of Western Sahara in the context of arrangements consistent 
with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United 
Nations, and noting the role and responsibilities of the 
parties in this respect, 
 
Reiterating its call upon the parties and States of the 
region to continue to cooperate fully with the United Nations 
to end the current impasse and to achieve progress towards a 
political solution, 
 
Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 16 
October 2006 (S/2006/817), 
 
¶1.    Reaffirms the need for full respect of the military 
agreements reached with MINURSO with regard to the cease-fire; 
 
¶2.    Calls on Member States to consider voluntary 
contributions to fund Confidence Building Measures that allow 
for increased contact between separated family members, 
especially family unification visits; 
 
 
 
¶3.    Requests the Secretary-General provide a report on the 
situation in the Western Sahara before the end of the mandate 
period; 
 
¶4.    Requests the Secretary-General to continue to take the 
necessary measures to ensure full compliance in MINURSO with 
the United Nations' zero-tolerance policy on sexual 
exploitation and abuse and to keep the Council informed, and 
urges troop-contributing countries to take appropriate 
preventive action including pre-deployment awareness 
training, and other action to ensure full accountability in 
cases of such conduct involving their personnel; 
 
¶5.    Decides to extend the mandate of the United Nations 
Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) until 
30 April 2007; 
 
¶6.    Decides to remain seized of the matter.
