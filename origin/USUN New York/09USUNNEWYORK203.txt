SUBJECT: DEPARTING SOUTH AFRICAN PR KUMALO AND RICE DISCUSS 
THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL, BILATERAL RELATIONS, AND DURBAN 
II 
 
¶1. (SBU) During Ambassador Rice's introductory meeting with 
South African PermRep Dumisani Kumalo on February 25, Kumalo 
said the Human Rights Council would "die" without U.S. 
participation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Rice said bilateral relations had not 
gone as well as hoped and the U.S. wanted to turn the page 
with South Africa.  Kumalo responded that the relationship 
should improve following South Africa's elections in April, 
since there would be a new foreign minister and deputy 
foreign minister, and he claimed previous points of 
contention, like Zimbabwe, were being resolved. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ambassador Kumalo shared his thoughts on ways to 
make the Durban Human Rights outcome document acceptable.  He 
suggested pressuring UNSYG Ban to warn of the possibility of 
a mass withdrawal from the conference which could redirect 
those countries pushing for the inclusion of anti-Semitic and 
defamatory language. 
 
¶4. (U)  Kumalo said he was to become the South Africa's 
Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region.  (Note:  Kumalo 
departed his position as PermRep February 27.  End Note).
