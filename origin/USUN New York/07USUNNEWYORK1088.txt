¶1.  Unclassified - entire text. 
 
¶2. Following a November 26 meeting between Diplomatic 
Security agents from the New York Field Office (DS/NYFO) and 
the security officer of the Cuban Mission to the UN to 
discuss further the NYPD's plan to remove the Mission's fixed 
post protection, DS/NYFO indicated that the Cubans would 
likely send USUN a note verbale registering their concern. 
That note (no. 6185 of 11/27/07) has now arrived.  Text 
follows in paragraph 3.  Reftel reports similar concerns of 
the Palestine Observer Mission. 
 
¶3. Begin Text: (Complimentary salutation)...and has the honor 
to convey its concern at the measure taken by the Diplomatic 
Security Service and the New York Police Department with 
regard to the partial removal of police protection of the 
Cuban Mission to the United Nations. 
In this regard, the Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United 
Nations would like to recall the serious precedents of 
hostile actions committed against our Mission and officials, 
some of which I have the honor to mention herein: 
- The assassination of the Cuban Mission official Felix 
Garcia Rodriguez, on 11 September 1980. 
- Repeated incidents at the entrance door of the Cuban 
Mission, including the chaining of such door by 
counterrevolutionary persons. 
- Systematic and even violent demonstrations against our 
Mission. 
- Freedom granted by the US authorities to Orlando Bosch, 
Luis Posada Carriles and others who have confessed their 
participation in terrorist acts against Cuba. 
The Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations wishes to 
stress the responsibility regarding the security of the 
Mission of Cuba to the United Nations, that the United States 
authorities incur in (sic) with this new measure taken. 
(Complimentary close). End text.
