PALESTINIAN RESOURCES 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. The UNGA Second Committee met November 20 to take action 
on four resolutions, including resolution A/C.2/63/L.5, 
entitled "Permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
and of the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan over 
their natural resources," submitted under Agenda item 38.  In 
accordance with reftel, the United States called for a vote 
and voted against the resolution, which was adopted 
139-6(U.S.)-4.  Following the vote, 10 countries (Senegal, 
Zambia, Trinidad and Tobago, Belize, Guinea, Brazil, Saudi 
Arabia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Peru and Finland) explained 
that they missed the vote, but asked that the record show 
they would have voted in favor of the resolution. 
 
¶3. Israel took the floor to note its disappointment over the 
result, stressing that resource issues should be handled 
through bilateral negotiations.  Israel went on to regret 
that the resolution did not reflect any of the progress made 
since last year, and that it once again failed to mention 
attacks by Hamas on the Israeli people.  The Palestinian 
delegate countered that Israel has "run out of excuses" for 
its occupation, and that it should not expect credit "merely" 
for  fulfilling its obligations to ensure the well-being of 
Palestinians.  On the issue of Hamas attacks, the Palestinian 
delegate accused Israel of committing its own "crushing acts 
of terrorism" against Palestinians.  France, on behalf of the 
EU, noted that it supported the resolution but nevertheless 
believes that the issues can best be addressed through 
bilateral negotiations and stressed that this resolution 
should not prejudge the outcome of those talks.
