SUBJECT: LATEST ON UN PRESENCE IN IRAQ 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: During a bi-weekly discussion with the UN 
and UK on Iraq-related matters, the UN confirmed that newly 
appointed Special Representative Staffan de Mistura has 
arrived in Baghdad, and had an introductory call on Foreign 
Minister Zebari, in which Zebari focused on the UN,s role in 
national reconciliation, national dialogue, capacity building 
and internal boundaries (especially Kirkuk).  The UN also 
reported that the Iraqi electoral commission has made strides 
to de-politicize nominations.  End summary. 
 
POLICY ISSUES 
 
¶2. (SBU) As of November 15, the UN reported a total of 73 
international staff in Baghdad and 26 international staff in 
Irbil.  Darko Mocibob, the UN,s Iraq team leader, told USUN 
and UKUN that plans to resume a UN presence in Basrah are 
proceeding, and they hope to have the first international 
staff in Basrah in early 2008.  Mocibob said David Shearer, 
D/SRSG for Humanitarian Affairs will likely visit Basrah in 
the coming weeks to prepare for a permanent UN presence 
there.  The initial focus of the UN,s presence in Basrah 
will be humanitarian/reconstruction, said Mocibob. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mocibob noted that de Mistura has arrived in 
Baghdad.  During an introductory call with FM Zebari, the 
Foreign Minister urged the UN to focus on national 
reconciliation, regional dialogue, increasing international 
staff in Iraq, capacity building, and disputed internal 
boundaries (especially Kirkuk).  Regarding Kirkuk, D/SRSG 
Michael Schulenberg recently visited Kirkuk and Irbil, and 
came back with positive reports that the Kurds are willing to 
involve the UN on the Kirkuk issue. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Cynthia Hatfield from the UN,s Electoral Assistance 
Division said that fears of an increasingly politicized Iraqi 
Election Commission (IHEC) have diminished in recent weeks, 
following IHEC decisions to make personnel decisions more 
transparent, and to reduce the ability for political 
considerations to impact the filling of technical positions. 
She added that IHEC commissioners have reengaged with the UN, 
and have asked it for more suggestions on ways to 
depoliticize the IHEC,s functioning. 
 
LOGISTICS ISSUES 
 
¶5. (SBU) Mocibob said the Distinct Entity Trust Fund, which 
pays for the UN,s "middle-ring" security, has received 
pledges from Portugal, Denmark and Germany, although the 
money has not yet been received by the UN.  The UN was also 
recently informed that the South Korean contingent providing 
"middle-ring" security in Irbil is decreasing in size, from 
36 to 20.  The UN does not yet know whether this will impact 
their presence in Iribil, since they are reviewing the 
security conditions in Irbil, with a view to possibly 
allowing more freedom of movement for UN personnel.  Mocibob 
added that the UN continues to engage with a South African 
company to provide a civilian plane with electronic 
counter-measures (ECM).  The Secretary-General will write to 
South Africa, requesting that they expedite the certification 
for this ECM-equipped civilian plane, so that the UN Mission 
in Iraq is given this independent air mobility as soon as 
possible.
