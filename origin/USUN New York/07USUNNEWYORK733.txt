¶1. (U) SUMMARY. New Assistant Secretary for Peacekeeping 
Operations Edmond Mulet delivered two separate briefings to 
the UNSC on September 7 regarding recent developments with 
the UN Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) and Mission of the United 
Nations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC). 
Following the Sudan briefing, delegations echoed calls for 
full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement 
(CPA) and highlighted linkages between the situation in 
southern Sudan and the Darfur conflict.  Qatar spoke at 
length but without support against continuation of sanctions 
against Sudan.  In the MONUC briefing, A/S Mulet described 
the recent deterioration of security conditions in eastern 
DRC and urged Council members to actively call for a 
cessation of hostilities between government and pro-Nkunda 
forces.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Broad Council Agreement on the 
Need for Full CPA Implementation 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) A/S Mulet briefed the Council in informal 
consultations on the August 20 report on the UN Mission in 
the Sudan pursuant to UNSCR 1590, which calls on the SYG to 
report to the Council regularly on implementation of the CPA 
and UNMIS.  Mulet said the overall security situation in 
southern Sudan remained calm during the reporting period, 
notwithstanding that progress on implementation of the CPA 
had been only limited (reftel).  He said progress between the 
National Congress Party (NCP) and Sudan People's Liberation 
Movement (SPLM) leaders on the sensitive oil contracts issue 
and the status of Abyei region had been likewise minimal.  He 
chracterized the failure of both sides to fully redeploy 
their forces by the July 9 deadline as a setback for CPA 
implementation.  Of the 46,000 Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) 
deployed to southern Sudan at the start of the CPA, only 
approximately 32,000 had been redeployed north of the January 
1, 1956 border by the end of the reporting period.  A/S Mulet 
also noted that the formation of the Joint Integrated Units 
(JIUs) is significantly behind schedule, and progress with 
the implementing legislation and population census necessary 
for the 2009 elections has stalled. 
 
¶3. (U) Delegations broadly echoed calls for full CPA 
implementation.  France, UK, Italy, Belgium, Ghana, South 
Africa and Congo expressed concern over the failure of the 
parties to implement key provisions of the CPA.  China, 
Russia and Indonesia highlighted linkages with the Darfur 
conflict and said that a sustainable peace in Darfur would 
help the Government of the Sudan (GOS) move forward on CPA 
implementation.  USUN had praise for UNMIS' assistance with 
the transition to the UNAMID hybrid operation in Darfur and 
called for its rapid deployment.  Qatar called for an end to 
the "international sanctions regimes" that contribute to 
Sudan's economic isolation and suggested that these financial 
pressures hinder the GOS from moving forward with CPA 
implementation.  (NOTE: Qatar appeared to be referring to 
bilateral US and EU sanctions against the GOS.  No other 
delegation raised this issue.  END NOTE.)  Lastly, 
delegations welcomed the appointment of Ashraf Qazi as the 
new SRSG for the Sudan.

DRC Violence 
Raises Concerns 
--------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Following the Sudan consultations, A/S Mulet delivered 
a short briefing on the recent escalation of violence in the 
North Kivu province of the DRC, which began August 27 in the 
Masisi and Rutshuru regions.  Mulet reported that clashes 
between DRC armed forces (FARDC) and rebels loyal to General 
Laurent Nkunda have displaced more than 10,000 civilians.  In 
response to the violence, MONUC has reinforced its 
deployments in North and South Kivu.  Mulet reported that 
MONUC has provided some logistical support to FARDC, but 
emphasized that this support is limited to assisting with the 
protection of civilian areas.  He reported that during the 
course of fighting outside the town of Sake on September 7, 
MONUC peacekeepers fired on pro-Nkunda forces after they were 
attacked by a small band of rebels.  He added that MONUC 
peacekeepers deployed in North Kivu were currently working to 
broker a ceasefire between the two sides.

¶5. (U) A/S Mulet referred to media reports that General 
Nkunda has offered to return to talks with the Kabila 
government as a positive sign and asked for UNSC members to 
encourage the two sides to return to dialogue.  He said the 
September 2 joint communique of the DRC and Rwandan Foreign 
Ministers promising to improve cooperation over border 
security is also a helpful step.  He said the crisis, 
however, was not over and urged Council members to speak out 
in support of cessation of hostilities and to encourage the 
parties to return to dialogue. At the UK's initiative, the 
Council asked the Security Council president (currently 
French PR Ripert) to make a short statement to the media 
emphasizing these themes.
