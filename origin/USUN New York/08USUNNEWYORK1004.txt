¶1. (SBU)  See ACTION REQUEST, paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon wrote to the 
Security Council on October 31 (text forwarded to IO), asking 
for expeditious consideration of MONUC's request for 
additional security assets.   The request, drafted by the 
UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and 
attached to Ban's letter, states "the resources available to 
the Mission are not commensurate to the security challenges 
on the ground," in light of the recent offensive by General 
Nkunda's CNDP rebel group.  It also notes "In 
view of the near total disintegration of the (DRC army) FARDC 
in face of advancing CNDP troops, MONUC has become the only 
organized force in Goma and has been compelled to step in to 
substitute for the role of the national security forces." 
The additional assets requested would result in an increase 
of 2,785 troops to MONUC's authorized military strength and 
300 to its Formed Police Unit strength. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The report notes the additional capacities required 
for the effective implementation of the mandate include: 
i).  Two Infantry Battalions (850 each) and two Special 
Forces Companies (150 each) as a rapid reaction force and 
reserve 
ii). Air assets including 18 utility helicopters and two 
C-130 Hercules aircraft 
iii). Rapid Reaction Force/Special Forces 
iv). Additional Information Analyisis Capability 
(approximately 50 additional personnel) 
v). One Engineer Company (175) 
vi). 200 Military training instructors/advisors to enhance 
ongoing FARDC training 
vii). Two additional Formed Police Units (150 each). 
 
¶4. (SBU)  ACTION REQUEST:  Mission requests the Department's 
guidance regarding this request as soon as possible.
