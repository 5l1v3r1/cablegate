COMMITTEE 
 
REF: A. STATE 084938 
     ¶B. OSLO 483 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On September 2, USUN discussed with the Norwegian 
UN mission a possible briefing to the 1737 (Iran) Sanctions 
Committee about Norway's planned nuclear safety project at 
the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant (ref A).  USUN explained to 
Jonas Jolle, Counselor for Political Affairs, that a 
Norwegian briefing to the Committee would set a positive 
example of transparency and encourage other states to inform 
the Committee of all activities relevant to the 
implementation of UNSCRs 1737, 1747 and 1803. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Noting that he had been informed of Embassy Oslo's 
recent outreach to the MFA on this matter (ref B), Jolle 
asserted that Norway was "extremely interested" in being 
transparent and agreed in principle with idea of a briefing. 
He said he was concerned, however, that the briefing be 
conducted in a proper format.  USUN noted that there is some 
leeway on the question of format, as there is no set 
precedent for this kind of briefing to the 1737 Committee. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) USUN and the Norwegian mission discussed the 
following parameters for such a briefing: 
 
-- Held first or second week in early October (at the same 
meeting at which the United States intends to provide a 
briefing on dual-use goods); 
 
-- A small team from Oslo would travel to New York to provide 
the briefing and be available to answer questions from 
Committee members; 
 
-- The Oslo experts would describe to the Committee the 
project and explain in detail the measures Norway will 
undertake to ensure all training activities comply with 
UNSCRs 1737, 1747 and 1803; 
 
-- A technical handout would be distributed to the Committee 
for members to forward to capitals for further review; 
 
-- USUN would encourage other Committee members to laud 
Norway's efforts and encourage other states to follow Oslo's 
good example; 
 
-- Norway would leave open the possibility of future 
briefings to Committee as the project moves forward. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Norwegian mission plans to take this concept 
back to Oslo for final approval.  USUN will provide any 
technical assistance necessary to help the mission formally 
request the meeting and follow Committee procedures.
