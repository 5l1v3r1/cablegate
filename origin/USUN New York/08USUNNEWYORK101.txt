1.(SBU) Summary.  Personal Envoy for Western Sahara Peter van 
Walsum briefed the Security Council on February 4 on the 
Secretary General's report from the third round of 
 
SIPDIS 
negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front. 
Delegations expressed disappointment that this round did not 
consist of substantive negotiations, but hoped for progress 
following van Walsum's upcoming trip to the region and the 
parties' commitment to engage in substantive negotiations at 
the fourth round of talks on March 11-13.  Several 
delegations raised concerns about human rights violations in 
the region and the lack of agreement on confidence-building 
measures.  Belgian Permrep Verbeke said that if the parties 
do not take responsibility for finding a solution, the 
Security Council would need to revisit their commitment to 
the process, while the Croatian DPR noted the need to 
consider an exit strategy for MINURSO troops if negotiations 
fail. The US-proposed press statement on Western Sahara was 
adopted at the end of the meeting. End Summary. 
 
VAN WALSUM: NO SUBSTANTIVE NEGOTIATIONS in 3rd ROUND 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
¶2. (SBU) Personal Envoy for Western Sahara Peter van Walsum 
briefed the Security Council on February 4 on the Secretary 
General's report from the third round of negotiations between 
Morocco and the Polisario Front. Van Walsum presented a 
"modest report describing a modest meeting," in which the 
parties did not engage in substantive negotiations despite 
good intentions and good faith efforts. He said that although 
the parties' fundamental positions were incompatible, he 
believed the negotiation process could break the impasse. He 
commented that the international community lacked the 
political will to solve the issue and would prefer to 
maintain the status quo rather than choose sides between the 
parties.  Van Walsum was encouraged by the parties' 
commitment to continue discussions on March 11-13 in 
Manhasset and by their agreement on the need to move into 
substantive negotiations.  He also noted that the SYG report 
on extending MINURSO would be due one month after the March 
meeting.  Van Walsum leaves February 5 to visit the region 
and consult with the parties. 
 
US SUPPORTS CONTINUING NEGOTIATIONS 
----------------------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) USUN Minister PolCouns said that the US was 
encouraged that the parties agreed to reconvene for more 
substantive negotiations in March and noted support for van 
Walsum's upcoming trip to the region. 
 
DELEGATIONS HOPE FOR PROGRESS IN 4th ROUND 
------------------------------------------ 
¶4. (SBU) All delegations expressed disappointment that the 
third round of negotiations did not achieve measurable 
progress, but were encouraged by the parties' commitment to 
engage in substantive negotiations in the fourth round of 
talks in March. Delegates reaffirmed their commitment to UNSC 
Resolutions 1754 and 1783 and their support for van Walsum's 
upcoming trip to the region. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Belgian Permrep Verbeke emphasized the need to hold 
the parties to their commitment to two basic principles: to 
negotiate in good faith without pre-conditions to achieve 
self-determination, and the responsibility of the two parties 
to find a mutually acceptable solution.  Verbeke said that if 
the parties do not take responsibility for finding a 
solution, the Security Council would need to revisit those 
principles. 
 
¶6. (SBU) French DPR Lacroix emphasized that the international 
community should focus on facilitating dialogue and must 
avoid any provocation on the ground. He also said that he 
believed the 2007 Moroccan Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara 
was a good starting point for negotiations.  Croatian DPR 
Muharemi noted the need to consider an exit strategy for 
MINURSO troops if negotiations failed, especially since TCCs 
had not been fully reimbursed by the UN for their costs. 
South African Permrep Kumalo highlighted the importance of 
supporting the self-determination efforts of the people in 
the last colony on the African continent, while Libyan DPR 
Dabbashi focused on the urgent need for a solution to 
encourage the implementation of the Arab Maghreb region. 
Panamanian Permrep Arias recommended that van Walsum 
encourage informal formats in future negotiations to help the 
parties overcome their lack of readiness for negotiations.

CONCERNS ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS AND CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES 
------------------------------------------- 
¶7. (SBU) The South African, Costa Rican, Croatian, and 
Panamanian delegations voiced concerns about human rights 
violations in the region, and Costa Rican DPR Weisleder noted 
that although it was too early for the SC to speak on the 
issue, he hoped it would revisit the issue soon. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The South African, Costa Rican, and Panamanian 
delegations also called for an increased focus on 
confidence-building measures. The South Africans called for 
cooperation between military commanders and political leaders 
and the Costa Ricans highlighted their uneasiness about the 
lack of agreement on humanitarian measures.  Van Walsum 
attributed the lack of agreement on confidence-building 
measures to Morocco's fear that focusing on such measures 
would divert attention from a political solution.  He also 
stated that Morocco wanted  to continue and expand existing 
measures, including extending the Family Program to cover 
land as well as air, instead of creating new ones. 
 
PRESS STATEMENT ADOPTED 
----------------------- 
¶9. (SBU) Security Council adopted the press statement 
proposed by the United States. 
Begin text: 
      The members of the Security Council welcome the report 
of the Secretary-General of 28 January 2008 (S/2008/45) on 
the status and progress of the negotiations on Western Sahara. 
      The members of the Security Council are pleased that 
the parties and States of the region agreed to meet on 11-13 
March 2008 in Manhasset, New York, in accordance with 
resolution 1783 (2007). 
      The members of the Security Council support the 
intention of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for 
Western Sahara to travel to the region for in-depth 
consultations in preparation for the next round of talks. 
      The members of the Security Council welcome that the 
parties reiterated their commitment to show political will 
and negotiate in good faith and agreed on the need to move 
the process into a more intensive and substantive phase of 
negotiations under United Nations auspices. 
      The members of the Security Council reaffirm their 
strong support for the efforts on the Secretary-General and 
his Personal Envoy to implement resolutions 1754 (2007) and 
1783 (2007).
