SUBJECT: UNSC: RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH INTERNATIONAL 
TRIBUNAL FOR LEBANON 
 
¶1. (U) Recalling a letter from the Government of Lebanon 
requesting the establishment of a tribunal of an 
international character to try all those responsible for the 
terrorist bombing that killed former Lebanese Prime Minister 
Rafiq Hariri as well as its request to the Secretary-General 
in UNSCR 1644 (2005) to help the Government of Lebanon 
identify the nature and scope of international assistance 
needed in this regard, the Security Council March 29 adopted 
a resolution -- UNSCR 1664 -- requesting the 
Secretary-General to negotiate an agreement with the 
 
SIPDIS 
Government of Lebanon to establish a tribunal of an 
international character based on the highest international 
standards of justice. 
 
¶2. (U) The resolution specifies neither the subject matter 
jurisdiction nor the duration of the tribunal to be 
established, but it directs the Secretary-General, in his 
negotiations with Lebanon, to take into account the 
recommendations of the Secretary-General,s March 21, 2006 
report to the Council pursuant to resolution 1644 (2004). 
That report identifies key issues relating to such a 
tribunal, such as the need to establish the tribunal,s 
jurisdiction, choose its applicable law and rules of 
procedure, select its location, determine the composition of 
the tribunal, and establish a mechanism to cover costs.  The 
U.S., France, and the UK co-sponsored the resolution, which 
the Council adopted unanimously.  The final text accommodates 
Russian concerns that Secretary-General take into account the 
views of Council members during the negotiations with Lebanon 
and that the Secretary-General update the Council as he deems 
appropriate on the progress of the negotiations. 
 
¶3. (U) Following the adoption of the resolution, Lebanese MFA 
Acting Secretary-General Boutros Assaker delivered a short 
statement welcoming the unanimous vote on the establishment 
of a tribunal as an indication of the international 
community's strong commitment and determination to punish all 
those involved in the Hariri assassination.  He also pledged 
the Government of Lebanon's efforts to conclude negotiations 
of an agreement with the Secretary-General as quickly as 
possible so the Security Council could approve and support 
the text. 
 
¶4. (U) Begin text of UNSCR 1664 (S/RES/2006/1664): 
 
The Security Council, 
 
Recalling all its previous resolutions, in particular 1595 
(2005) of 7 April 2005, 1636 (2005) of 31 October 2005 and 
1644 (2005) of 15 December 2005, 
 
Reiterating its call for the strict respect of the 
sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political 
independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive 
authority of the Government of Lebanon, 
 
Mindful of the demand of the Lebanese people that all those 
responsible for the terrorist bombing that killed former 
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and others be identified 
and brought to justice, 
 
Recalling the letter of the Prime Minister of Lebanon to the 
Secretary-General of 13 December 2005 (S/2005/783) requesting 
 
SIPDIS 
inter alia the establishment of a tribunal of international 
character to try all those who are found responsible for this 
terrorist crime and recalling its request to the 
Secretary-General in its resolution 1644 (2005) to help the 
 
SIPDIS 
Government of Lebanon identify the nature and scope of the 
international assistance needed in this regard, 
 
Having examined the report of 21 March 2006 submitted by the 
Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 6 of resolution 1644 
 
SIPDIS 
(2005) (S/2006/176), and welcoming the common understanding 
reached between the Secretariat and the Lebanese authorities 
on the key issues regarding the establishment and the main 
features of a possible tribunal, 
 
Willing to continue to assist Lebanon in the search for the 
truth and in holding all those involved in this terrorist 
attack accountable, 
 
¶1.  Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General and requests 
him to negotiate an agreement with the Government of Lebanon 
aimed at establishing a tribunal of an international 
character based on the highest international standards of 
criminal justice, taking into account the recommendations of 
his report and the views that have been expressed by Council 
members; 
 
 
 
¶2.  Acknowledges that the adoption of the legal basis of, and 
framework for, the tribunal, would not prejudice the gradual 
phasing-in of its various components and would not 
predetermine the timing of the commencement of its 
operations, which will depend on the progress of the 
investigation; 
 
¶3.  Requests the Secretary-General to update the Council on 
the progress of the negotiation as he deems appropriate and 
to submit in a timely manner for the consideration of the 
Council a report on the implementation of this resolution, in 
particular on the draft agreement negotiated with the 
Lebanese Government, including options for a funding 
mechanism appropriate to ensure the continued and efficient 
functioning of the tribunal; 
 
¶4.  Decides to remain seized of the matter.
