Summary 
----------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 26, UN Team Leader for Iraq Darko Mocibob 
met with USUN and UKUN for a regularly scheduled trilateral 
meeting on Iraq.  Mocibob provided updates on UNAMI security, 
logistics and mandate issues.  On the UN's long-term 
compound, Mocibob confirmed that Iraq had formally approved 
the location, but said it remained unclear as to how much GOI 
intends to contribute financially to its construction. 
Mocibob briefly discussed the status of voter registration 
and preparations for the upcoming provincial elections.  He 
opined that meeting the October deadline for elections will 
be challenging, speculating that elections are more likely to 
occur at the end of December if the new election law is 
passed by the end of July.  The UN is confident that a recent 
request for a six-month extension to the Distinct Entity 
Trust Fund currently due to expire in August will be 
approved.  Finally, Mocibob informed USUN that SRSG de 
Mistura would participate in the 11 July Iraq strategic 
dialogue by secure VTC from Erbil. 
 
The Future of the Distinct Equity Trust Fund 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Distinct Equity Trust Fund, which pays for the 
Georgian contingent providing "Middle-Ring" security to the 
UNAMI compound in Baghdad, has sufficient funds to operate 
through August.  UNAMI recently requested a six-month 
extension at a cost of $1.2 million.  Of the 18 member 
countries that have previously contributed, Germany recently 
pledged to contribute an additional $500,000 and there are 
indications that Belgium, Finland, and Italy will make 
smaller contributions.  Mocibob is confident that the 
extension request will be approved and is encouraged by the 
generous offers of support by member countries received thus 
far. 
 
Provincial Elections Update 
 
¶3. (SBU) UNAMI will initiate July 5 a comprehensive public 
outreach program to inform Iraqis about voter registration 
scheduled for July 15.  IFES and USAID will assist in this 
effort.  The election law is still in draft form and there 
are a number of outstanding issues, such as the form of the 
election (open or closed) and whether or not Kirkuk will 
participate.  Mocibob stated that the UN is considering 
issuing a statement to the GOI and the COR urging adoption of 
an election law by the end of July and explaining the 
technical reasons why the provincial elections cannot occur 
by October if a law is not passed.  USUN asked the UN to 
discuss their thoughts regarding MNF-I's potential role in 
the election process.  The UN said this discussion was 
beginning in Baghdad, but acknowledged the need to increase 
joint planning as the election process moves forward, 
including through discussion at the next UN-U.S. high-level 
strategic dialogue on Iraq scheduled for July 11 in New York. 
 Mocibob also reported that SRSG de Mistura would participate 
in the dialogue by secure VTC from Erbil. 
 
Steps to Increase Regional Dialogue 
 
¶4. (SBU) Mocibob stated that SRSG de Mistura recently visited 
Turkey and Jordan to increase regional participation in Iraq, 
and expects to visit Tehran by the end of July.  UNAMI is 
moving forward with plans to put a liaison officer in Tehran. 
 
 
Update on the UNAMI Compound 
 
¶5. (SBU) In regards to the UNAMI compound, Mocibob stated 
that the ACABQ (UN budget advisory committee) would not 
address the proposal until the fall session.  UNAMI believes 
that this delay will provide more time to address the extent 
of Iraq's financial contribution.  SRSG de Mistura is 
expected to participate in the ACABQ meeting by SVTC.  The UN 
expects the cost of the compound ($98 million) to remain the 
same. 
 
UNAMI's Increased Capability 
 
¶6. (SBU) UNAMI now has a fixed wing aircraft that will be 
forward deployed to Iraq this week.  UNAMI will possibly 
consider obtaining rotary wing aircraft in the future.  UNAMI 
recently received an offer from Nepal to fill two MILAD 
positions.  Georgia also offered to provide one MILAD officer 
pending DPKO approval.  UNICEF's presence in Iraq has 
increased over the last six months as the security 
environment in Iraq has become more permissive.  The incoming 
Iraq UNICEF Representative will be permanently stationed in 
Baghdad by the end of July.
