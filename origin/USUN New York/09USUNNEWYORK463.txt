SUBJECT: UNSC UNANIMOUSLY EXTENDS MINURSO FOR ANOTHER YEAR 
 
¶1. The Security Council on April 30 unanimously adopted 
Resolution 1871 to extend the mandate of the UN Mission for 
the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) until April 30, 
¶2010.  Ambassador Rice gave the first explanation of vote 
(EOV), reiterating U.S. support for Personal Envoy Chris Ross 
and his proposals for informal talks with the parties.  She 
also underlined that the conflict in Western Sahara had 
prevented regional cooperation and contributed to poor 
relations between Morocco and Algeria.  The French PermRep 
said France welcomes the resolution's reiteration of support 
for the Manhassat process and for UNSC Resolution 1813 
(2008), which he said constituted the "roadmap" for the 
negotiations.  He expressed hope that the parties would 
return to negotiations with "realism and a spirit of 
compromise," said that the Morooccan autonomy proposal could 
serve as a contructive proposal, and said he endorsed the 
progress made on humanitarian issues as a way to promote 
trust and confidence between the parties. 
 
¶2. The Russian PermRep said that "on the whole, the Russian 
position on Western Sahara remains unchanged," and that 
Russia supports a fair, lasting, and mutually acceptable 
resolution to the conflict.  He expressed hope that the 
consensus resolution will "breathe new life" into the 
moribund process.  The UK PermRep said the unanimous adoption 
sends an important signal to the parties and underlined the 
importance of expanding the Secretary-General's 
recommendation to improve the humanitarian and human-rights 
situation.  The Costa Rican PermRep said was not satisfied 
with the text, but voted for it because of the importance of 
giving unanimous support to the process.  He said full 
respect for human rights is an essential prerequisite for 
confidence building, not an obstacle "as some seem to think." 
 Uganda's intervention echoed that of Costa Rica and added 
that MINURSO is the only contemporary peacekeeping mission 
without a human-rights component in the mandate.  Austria and 
Mexico recalled their support for human rights and underlined 
the importance of unity in the Council.
