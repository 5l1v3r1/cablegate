SUBJECT: MONUC EXTENDED 5 MONTHS; MANDATE CALLS FOR 
ENFORCING CONDITIONALITY 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Security Council unanimously renewed 
MONUC's mandate on December 23 for 5 months, with the 
intention to further extend it an additional 12 months. 
During Council consultations on December 16, SRSG Doss said 
the "Kimia II" operations against the FDLR would end in 
December, and would be followed by a more targeted operation, 
which included a "clear, hold, build" strategy for former 
FDLR territories.  Doss warned of the volatility in the 
Kivus, and said "warlordism" could return if the GDRC went 
after all high-ranking military leaders accused of abuses. 
The Council agreed that Protection of Civilians was MONUC's 
top priority.  USUN solicited views from the top five troop 
contributors to MONUC prior to negotiating the new 
resolution. END SUMMARY. 
 
MANDATE EXTENDED 5 MONTHS   12, STRONG CONDITIONALITY 
 
¶2. (SBU) On December 23, the Security Council unanimously 
renewed the UN Mission in the DRC's (MONUC) mandate until May 
31, 2010, with the intention to extend it for an additional 
12 months, under SCR 1906.  The mandate prioritizes MONUC's 
tasks, in order, as: (1) protection of civilians (PoC); (2) 
disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, resettlement, and 
reintegration (DDRRR); and (3) security sector reform (SSR). 
The mandate, inter alia, conditions MONUC's support to the 
DRC army (FARDC) on joint planning, especially regarding the 
protection of civilians, and demands that the GDRC take 
measures to protect civilians, in furtherance of SCR 1888 
(2009). 
 
COUNCIL CONSULTATIONS: KIMIA II TO END THIS MONTH... 
 
¶3. (SBU) MONUC Special Representative of the Secretary 
General (SRSG) Alan Doss told the Council in closed 
consultations on December 16 that the MONUC-supported FARDC 
"Kimia II" operation against the FDLR would end by December 
¶31. "Kimia II" would be followed by a more targeted phase of 
operations, tentatively entitled "Amani Leo," (Swahili for 
"Peace Today") to be launched in January.  He said MONUC 
would assist the FARDC in implementing a "clear, hold, build" 
strategy for areas occupied by the FDLR, then implement an 
SSR program to build state authority. 
 
...KIVUS COULD "EXPLODE;" IMPUNITY AND BOSCO... 
 
¶4. (SBU) While Doss acknowledged the need to address 
impunity, especially within the FARDC, he cautioned that the 
Kivus would "explode" if all military leaders accused of 
atrocities were removed from command positions.  Doss said 
that he feared new militias or rebel groups would form and 
"warlordism" could appear.  He also noted that International 
Criminal Court (ICC) indictee Bosco Ntaganda was surrounding 
himself with supporters and might look to break up CNDP 
integration if he believed he would be turned over to the 
ICC. 
 
...DIFFICULTY IMPLEMENTING MARCH 23 AGREEMENTS 
 
¶5. (SBU) Doss said the implementation of the March 23 peace 
agreements was slowing down.  The integration of former CNDP 
combatants into the FARDC was not moving forward due to, in 
part, the failure to commission CNDP officers and address 
rank issues.  Doss said additional funding was required to 
ensure full implementation of the agreements as well as the 
payment of the new FARDC members. 
 
COUNCIL REACTIONS 
 
¶6. (SBU) French PR Araud emphasized that MONUC withdrawal at 
this time risked undermining the stability of the DRC.  He 
stressed that the Council must prepare for transition, but 
MONUC could not leave until the DRC had credible state 
authority.  Ambassador DiCarlo stressed the need for 
accountability at the highest levels of government, and said 
that conditioning further UN support on adequate protection 
of civilians is critical if MONUC is to maintain its 
credibility.  Ugandan PR Rugunda seconded DiCarlo's call to 
expeditiously complete a comprehensive strategic review of 
MONUC.  All Council members, including China, agreed PoC was 
the top priority for MONUC. 
 
NEGOTIATIONS: CHINA'S UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO REPRIORITIZE 
MONUC 
 
¶7. (SBU) During Council negotiations on the mandate text, 
China supported prioritizing DDRRR efforts ahead of SSR and 
PoC, apparently at the behest of the GDRC.  Unified Council

opposition convinced China to withdraw its proposal. 
 
USUN OUTREACH TO TOP 5 MONUC TROOP CONTRIBUTORS WARMLY 
RECEIVED 
 
¶8. (SBU) USUN Military Advisors met with the Uruguayan, 
Pakistani, and Bangladeshi Military advisors prior to the 
renewal of the MONUC mandate, and Poloff met with Indian and 
South African poloffs to solicit their views.  All five 
countries commended the United States on our outreach and for 
listening to the TCC's input in the Security Council Working 
Group on Peacekeeping. The interlocutors welcomed the U.S.'s 
efforts to solicit feedback from those countries  charged 
with carrying out the mandate. They used the opportunity to 
state that MONUC had a very aggressive mandate, but does not 
have the resources to carry it out, specifically air and 
intelligence assets.
