Classified By: Ambassador Alejandro D. Wolff, Deputy Permanent Represen 
tative, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
(C) During a one-on-one lunch on February 11, Ambassador 
Khalilzad raised U.S. concerns with the candidacy of Miguel 
D'Escoto for PGA with Panamanian FM Lewis Navarro.  FM Lewis 
Navarro agreed that D'Escoto was a bad choice for PGA and the 
region, and further noted that the Nicaraguan was too ill to 
do the job. He agreed to work with the U.S. to help identify 
an alternate candidate, suggesting Paraguay or Guatemala as 
preferred options.  He recommended that the U.S. and Panama 
reach out together to the Brazilians, requesting their 
engagement on finding a suitable candidate to represent 
GRULAC.  Lewis Navarro thought a useful argument could be 
that, as a matter of balance with two Central American states 
on the Security Council, a South American ought to represent 
GRULAC as PGA. In this case, Paraguay, in particular 
Paraguayan UN PermRep Loizaga, would be the ideal candidate. 
Lewis Navarro predicted that once an alternative candidate 
came forward, others would follow, breaking the emerging (and 
otherwise perhaps inevitable?) consensus D'Escoto enjoys 
because of lack of competition.
