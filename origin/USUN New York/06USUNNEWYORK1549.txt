SUBJECT: UN SEEKS FUNDS FOR EXPANDED UNIFIL MISSION 
 
¶1. The Security Council, by its resolution 1701 (2006) of 
August 11, 2006, decided to supplement and enhance the United 
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in numbers, 
equipment, mandate and scope of operations, thereby 
authorizing an increase in the force strength of UNIFIL from 
2,000 to a maximum of 15,000 troops. 
 
¶2.  To facilitate the deployment of the additional troops, 
the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary 
Questions (ACABQ) has been requested to authorize the 
Secretary General to enter into commitments not to exceed $50 
 
SIPDIS 
million to meet most immediate and essential preparatory 
steps to constitute a planning team, conduct strategic lift 
of the additional forces, initiate procurement actions for 
goods and services, including additional requirements for air 
transportation, naval transportation, facilities and 
infrastructure. This request is made in accordance with 
section IV of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 
December 23, 1994, whereby if a decision of the Security 
Council relating to the start-up phase or expansion phase of 
a peacekeeping operation results in the need for expenditure, 
the Secretary General is authorized, with the prior 
concurrence of the ACABQ to enter into commitments not to 
exceed $50 million. 
 
¶3.  The ACABQ was informed by the Secretariat that in 
addition to the immediate requirement of $50 million, 
UNIFIL's current appropriation of $97.6 million for the 
period from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007 shall be used 
flexibly to meet the requirements of the expanded UNIFIL. 
 
¶4.  It is anticipated that the budget for the expanded UNIFIL 
mission will total $1 billion for the year, comparable to the 
budgets for the two largest UN Missions in the Congo (MONUC) 
and Sudan (UNMIS).  A formal budget will be presented and a 
request for appropriation and assessment will made later this 
fall to the ACABQ and the General Assembly.
