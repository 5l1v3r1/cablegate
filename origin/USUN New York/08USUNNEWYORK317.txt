SUBJECT: LEBANON TRIBUNAL:  CANADA TO CONTRIBUTE 1 MILLION 
 
 
(SBU) The Canadian Mission has advised USUN that Canada will 
contribute USD 1,000,000 to the Special Tribunal for Lebanon 
(STL).  Canada hopes to become a member of the Management 
Committee for the STL and expects to provide additional 
contributions to the STL in the future, including possible 
in-kind donations.  Canada's Royal Mounted Police have 
provided security for the Charles Taylor trial of the Sierra 
Leone Special Court, and Canada might provide similar 
protection for STL Prosecutor-Designate Daniel Bellemare 
(Canada) once he assumes his duties.  Canada has served 
effectively as the Chairman of the Management Committee for 
the Sierra Leone Special Court and might be willing to serve 
as Vice Chairman of the STL Management Committee.
