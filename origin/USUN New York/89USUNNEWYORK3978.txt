REF: STATE 403831 
 
¶1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT) 
 
¶2.  SUMMARY.  AMB PICKERING MET WITH SC PRESIDENT 
(COLOMBIA) DEC 20 TO ASK THAT A LETTER SETTING FORTH THE 
REASONS FOR U.S. ACTIONS IN PANAMA AND A COPY OF 
PRESIDENT BUSH'S STATEMENT BE CIRCULATED AS OFFICIAL UN 
DOCUMENTS.  PICKERING ALSO ARGUED AGAINST PREMATURE 
ACTION BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL, SUGGESTING THAT THE SC 
WAIT TO SEE WHAT ACTION THE OAS WOULD TAKE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  AMBS PICKERING AND WATSON, TOGETHER WITH POL AND 
LEGAL COUNSELORS, MET WITH SC PRESIDENT ENRIQUE PENALOSA 
(COLOMBIA) MORNING DEC 20.  PICKERING DELIVERED TO 
PENALOSA COPIES OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S STATEMENT MADE 
7:20AM DEC 20 AND A LETTER SETTING FORTH THE REASONS FOR 
U.S. ACTION IN PANAMA.  HE ASKED THAT BOTH BE CIRCULATED 
AS OFFICIAL SC DOCUMENTS.  PENALOSA AGREED. 
 
¶4.  PENALOSA SAID HE NEEDED U.S. ADVICE REGARDING THE 
NICARAGUAN REQUEST FOR AN IMMEDIATE MEETING OF THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL.  HIS OWN INCLINATION WOULD BE TO HOLD 
INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS OF THE WHOLE COUNCIL AT 11:00AM, 
THEN FOLLOW WITH AN OPEN MEETING WHERE THE U.S., THE 
NICARAGUANS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES DELEGATIONS 
COULD MAKE STATEMENTS.  HE DID NOT ANTICIPATE THE 
COUNCIL TAKING ANY IMMEDIATE ACTION, BUT OVER THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS THAT HE WOULD REMAIN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE 
MEMBERS, SEE HOW THE SITUATION DEVELOPS, AND DETERMINE 
IF A FURTHER MEETING AND ANY OTHER ACTION IS NECESSARY. 
PENALOSA ALSO SUGGESTED THAT MAYBE THE LATIN MEMBERS OF 
THE COUNCIL COULD PREPARE A PROPOSAL.  PICKERING 
INDICATED IT WAS PREMATURE TO CONSIDER SUCH AN APPROACH. 
 
¶5.  PICKERING STRESSED THAT IT IS IMPRACTICAL TO HAVE 
CONSULTATIONS OF THE WHOLE COUNCIL SO EARLY.  A NUMBER 
OF QUESTIONS NEEDED TO BE CONSIDERED.  HE SAID THE 
DEMOCRATICALLY-ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA HAD 
APPOINTED A NEW PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE AND THAT HIS 
CREDENTIALS WOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE SYG VERY SHORTLY. 
THE U.S. FEELS STRONGLY THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
NORIEGA REGIME SHOULD NOT SPEAK IN THE COUNCIL AND THAT 
THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA SHOULD BE SEATED. 
 
¶6.  PICKERING ALSO SAID THAT THE OAS WAS CONSIDERING THE 
ISSUE.  HE ARGUED THAT SINCE THE OAS IS THE REGIONAL 
FORUM FROM WHICH, UNDER ARTICLE 52 OF THE CHARTER, THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD TAKE ITS LEAD.  HE SUGGESTED 
THAT PENALOSA MAY WANT TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE 
COLOMBIAN AMBASSADOR AT THE OAS IN ORDER TO LEARN FOR 
HIMSELF WHAT STEPS THE OAS WAS PLANNING TO TAKE. 
 
¶7.  PICKERING CONCLUDED BY SUGGESTING THAT PENALOSA 
CONSULT WITH INTERESTED MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL 
BILATERALLY AND SCHEDULE ANOTHER MEETING WITH THE U.S. 
LATER IN THE DAY TO DISCUSS THE POSITIONS OF THE MEMBERS 
OF THE COUNCIL.  PICKERING EMPHASIZED THAT IT WOULD BE 
PREMATURE TO RUSH AHEAD WITH CONSULTATIONS OF THE WHOLE 
THIS MORNING. 
 
¶8.  PICKERING NOTED THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAD SPOKEN BY 
TELEPHONE WITH PRESIDENT BARCO (WHO SAID HE WOULD TRY TO 
BE HELPFUL), PRIME MINISTERS MULRONEY AND THATCHER AND 
OTHER LEADERS.  HE ALSO SAID THAT PRELIMINARY REPORTS 
INDICATE THAT A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ARE READY TO 
RECOGNIZE THE NEW GOVERNMENT. 
 
¶9.  COMMENT.  IN AN EFFORT TO DELAY SC CONSIDERATION OF 
THE ISSUE AND ALLOW THE PERMREP OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT TO PRESENT HIS CREDENTIALS, USUN 
IS ATTEMPTING TO PROLONG THE PERIOD OF BILATERAL 
CONSULTATIONS.  AT OUR REQUEST, THE UK, FRENCH, AND 
CANADIAN DELEGATIONS HAVE ALSO REQUESTED BILATERAL 
CONSULTATIONS WITH THE SC PRESIDENT.  END COMMENT. 
 
MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
