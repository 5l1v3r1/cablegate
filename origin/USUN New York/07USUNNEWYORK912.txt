¶1.  Unclassified - entire text. 
 
¶2.  The Libyan Mission to the UN has sent USUN an October 18 
diplomatic note protesting what it characterizes as an 
instruction from the Department of Homeland Security that 
nationals of certain countries - including Libya - be 
subjected to secondary inspection on departure from U.S. 
airports.  The Mission requests to be informed whether this 
procedure also applies to Libyan diplomats.  Text of note 
follows in paragraph 3 below. 
 
¶3. Begin text: The Permanent Mission of the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya to the United Nations in New York presents its 
compliments to the Permanent Mission of the United States of 
America to the United Nations and has the honor to inform the 
latter that airline companies, when flying internationally 
and domestically, place the symbol (ssss) on the tickets of 
members of this mission and their families on their departure 
from American airports.  This measure constitutes unjustified 
personal inspection for persons who enjoy diplomatic immunity 
and occurs even on presentation of diplomatic passports and 
tickets which confirm their status. 
 
On questioning airline companies concerning the origin of 
this procedure, they confirmed that this implements 
instructions from the American Department of Homeland 
Security requiring airline companies to place this symbol on 
the tickets of persons of certain nationalities, including 
Libyan citizens, regardless of their professional status. 
 
The Permanent Mission of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to the 
United Nations would like to draw the attention of the 
Permanent Mission of the United States to the United Nations 
to this matter, wishes to inform the latter formally of the 
basis of this measure, and wishes to be informed whether it 
applies to diplomats and their families. 
 
The Permanent Mission of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to the 
United Nations avails itself of this opportunity to renew to 
the Permanent Mission of the United States of America to the 
United Nations the assurances of its highest consideration.
