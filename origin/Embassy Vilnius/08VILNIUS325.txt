REF: SECSTATE 46997 
 
Post is considering two possibilities to promote the May 21 
"Day of Solidarity with Cuba."  The first is cooperation with 
and assistance to a Cuban dissident, Bertha Antunez, who 
plans to visit Lithuania May 7.   Assistance, if needed, 
could include arranging for media interviews or meeting with 
relevant NGOs or GOL officials.  The second possibility is to 
work with a local NGO to create a public program to express 
solidarity with the people of Cuba, including an emphasis on 
some of the parallel hardships faced by the people of 
neighboring Belarus.
