Post delivered ref A, B, and C points April 10 to Rimgaile 
Karciauskaite, First Secretary, and Martynas Lukosevecius, 
Attache, in the MFA's Arms Control, Non-proliferation, and 
Disarmament Division.  Karciauskaite said the GOL supports 
strong sanctions on Iran and agreed enforcement of the travel 
ban and dual use items should be strict.  Lukosevecius noted 
that the GOL,s enforcement exceeds what the UNSC resolutions 
require, and cited an example from early January when the GOL 
halted the sale of lasers from a Lithuanian firm to an 
Iranian firm.  Karciauskaite added that the GOL notified the 
Nuclear Supplier,s Group and the IAEA about the halting of 
the sale.  Lukosevecius noted the EU will adopt a common 
position with appropriate regulations for the travel ban "in 
due time."
