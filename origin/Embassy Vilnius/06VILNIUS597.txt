CONFERENCE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 102464 
 
(U) Lithuania intends to send both Defense and Foreign 
Affairs Ministry officials to the July 20-21 Provincial 
Reconstruction Team effectiveness conference in Budapest.  We 
delivered the invitation, agenda, and Lithuania-specific 
questions to Alvydas Kunigelis, Director of International 
Relations at the Ministry of Defense and Vytautas Leskavicius 
of the MFA's Security Policy Department.  Kunigelis told us 
that he had already heard about the conference and that the 
Ministry would send one or two representatives.  Leskavicius 
told us that the MFA would coordinate with the Defense 
Ministry and let us know soon who would make up the 
Lithuanian delegation.  Both officials said that Lithuania is 
enthusiastic about the conference and eager to participate.
