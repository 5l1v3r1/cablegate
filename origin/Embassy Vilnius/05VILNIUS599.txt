CONFERENCE ON IRAQ 
 
REF: SECSTATE 103222 
 
The Ambassador delivered reftel points on the June 22 U.S.-EU 
International Conference on Iraq to MFA Undersecretary Dalius 
Cekuolis June 8.  The Ambassador thanked Cekuolis for the 
GOL's contribution to Iraq reconstruction at the 2003 Madrid 
Conference, and for committing to establish a diplomatic 
mission in Iraq.  The Ambassador hoped that there would be 
high-level GOL representation in Brussels at the upcoming 
conference, and encouraged the GOL to offer the Iraq 
Transitional Government (ITG) whatever assistance it can. 
Cekuolis said that he, rather than Foreign Minister Antanas 
Valionis, will probably represent Lithuania at the 
conference, and that the GOL will likely pledge in Brussels 
training support for the ITG.
