SUBJECT: MALAWI - UNHCR CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR ZIMBABWE REFUGEES 
 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: UNHCR Malawi told emboff that they have contingency 
plans in place in the event that sustained post-election violence 
forces Zimbabwean refugees into Malawi.  Due to close historic and 
family ties, Zimbabwean migrants have so far blended into Malawian 
society and few have shown up at the refugee camp.  In the event of 
a large influx of refugees, UNHCR and the government of Malawi will 
reopen the recently-closed Luwani Refugee Camp in southern Malawi 
which still has shelters, schools, and medical clinics in place. 
While the government of Malawi remains concerned about foreigners 
taking jobs away from locals, some have expressed new concerns that 
without a national identification system, Zimbabweans in Malawi 
could register for next year's elections in Malawi.  End Summary 
 
Contingency Plan in Place for Zimbabwean Refugees 
--------------------------- --------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) UNHCR told emboff that contingency plans are in place in the 
event that sustained post-election violence sends Zimbabwean 
refugees into Malawi.  With strong ties stretching back to the 
colonial era, some estimate there could be three million Zimbabweans 
with ancestry from Malawi.  Many Zimbabweans have already come to 
Malawi, and assisted by friends or distant relatives have 
successfully blended into Malawian society.  Only a few families 
have actually shown up at the refugee camp seeking refuge. 
 
¶3. (U) In the event of a large influx of refugees, UNHCR said the 
government of Malawi will be forced to reopen the Luwani refugee 
camp.  The Dzaleka camp in central Malawi only has capacity for 
approximately 1500 more refugees but UNHCR said during the height of 
the Mozambican war, close to 200,000 refugees were in Luwani. 
Luwani was closed last year in an effort to consolidate Malawi's 
refugee population of just over 9000 in one place.  While Luwani 
still has shelters, schools, and medical facilities, the GOM has 
begun transforming the camp into a prison facility.  In addition to 
identifying space and shelter, UNHCR is working with the World Food 
Program to line up additional food sources and has begun to procure 
additional medical supplies as a precaution. 
 
Concerns about Zims Being Used for Election Fraud 
--------------------------- --------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) While the government of Malawi continues to have concerns 
about foreigners taking jobs from locals, some are expressing new 
concerns that the lack of a national identity system in Malawi could 
allow migrants from Zimbabwe to register to vote in the 2009 
presidential elections.  It is difficult to determine the magnitude 
and distribution of Zimbabwean migrants in Malawi, but opposition 
leaders have already advised the Malawi Electoral Commission that it 
needs to be able to account for the risk. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The more prosperous economies of South Africa and 
Botswana may be more appealing, but with strong ties, porous 
borders, and an excellent reputation as a host of refugees, Malawi 
could be an appealing destination if prolonged violence becomes an 
issue in Zimbabwe.  Malawians would be more likely to tolerate 
refugees from Zimbabwe than other nationals, such as Somali and 
Congolese, who are currently crossing multiple borders to claim 
asylum in Malawi.  The likelihood of Zimbabweans being used to vote 
for candidates in an election seems unlikely at this point and is 
just one of many issues the opposition has raised to the electoral 
commission to protest the lack of consultation by government in the 
commission's composition.
