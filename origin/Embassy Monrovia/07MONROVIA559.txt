¶1. (U) Charge d'Affaires and Poloff (notetaker) met May 14 
with Cristina Diaz Fernandez-Gil, Assistant Director for 
Cooperation with Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia at the Spanish 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Fernandez-Gil was accompanied by 
Spain's Honorary Consul in Liberia Manuel Cuenca, Carolina 
Diz Otero of the Galicia Region's Office for Foreign 
Cooperation, and Luis Padilla Macabeo of the Canary Islands' 
Office for African Relations.  Fernandez-Gil told Charge that 
the delegation came to Liberia in response to President Ellen 
Johnson Sirleaf's appeal for assistance during her March 2007 
visit to Madrid.  She said the delegation would identify two 
projects that Spain could carry out in Liberia, one in the 
health sector and one in fisheries. Fernandez-Gil said the 
delegation would meet with Minister of Gender Varbah Gayflor 
to explore ways of assisting with gender issues, particularly 
support for women entrepreneurs and promoting legislation to 
protect women. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Fernandez-Gil noted that the local governments of 
the regions of Galicia and the Canary Islands were invited to 
explore carrying out projects in Liberia because the Spanish 
Government cannot provide bilateral assistance since Liberia 
is not included in Spain's Africa plan.  According to 
Fernandez-Gil, the Liberian Government requested 
infrastructure support for the port of Monrovia. 
Fernandez-Gil said Spain provides training, but does not 
provide infrastructure assistance.  Charge said poor 
management and corruption are serious problems at the port 
and suggested that the delegation meet with the port's 
Liberia Governance and Economic Management Assistance Program 
(GEMAP) advisor. Charge also suggested that the Spanish 
consider providing help in building a fish market with cold 
storage since many women in Liberia work as fish mongers, and 
this could assist in two ways by promoting fisheries 
development and by assisting women entrepreneurs with better 
retail facilities. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In response to Fernandez-Gil's query about the state 
of the Liberian health sector, Charge noted that many NGOs 
that focused on emergency health care in rural areas are 
pulling out as Liberia evolves from an emergency phase to a 
focus on development.  He said the Ministry of Health is not 
yet equipped to adequately provide health services to the 
people.  Charge added that malaria is the major health 
problem in the country and that the USG would be increasing 
engagement in this area as Liberia has been selected as a 
target country for the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI). 
He added that reliable health data has not been available, 
but that a demographic health survey is currently underway. 
 
¶4. (U) Fernandez-Gil announced that as part of Spain's 
growing engagement in West Africa, a diplomat would be 
assigned to Sierra Leone in August who would also have 
responsibility for covering Liberia. This diplomat will have 
a desk in the European Commission office in Monrovia.  She 
also stated that Spain has created a 10 million Euro fund 
with the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) to 
promote women's empowerment in Africa.
