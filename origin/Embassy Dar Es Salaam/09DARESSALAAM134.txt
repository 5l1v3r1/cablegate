 ¶1. (SBU) MFA Africa Division Deputy Director Zuhura Bandala 
told Poloff Mar. 3 that Tanzania was trying its best to 
ensure that the situation in Zimbabwe was resolved. She 
emphasized the GOT's policy of working through SADC (per AU 
directive) to be supportive as Zimbabwe returned to peace and 
economic normalization.  Bandala cited the medicine Tanzania 
provided to help with Zimbabwe's cholera epidemic as an 
example of direct support.  She expressed satisfaction with 
the initial steps to implement the decisions of the January 
SADC meeting, which she said might not be formally reviewed 
until the next SADC summit in August. She was appreciative of 
the update on the U.S. position on the new government (ref A). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bandala had not heard previously that illicit 
Zimbabwean diamonds were passing through Tanzania (ref B), 
but promised to look into the matter.
