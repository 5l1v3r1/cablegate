¶1. (SBU) Minister Counselor Nelson Lyimo, the acting Deputy 
Director of the Africa Department of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and International Cooperation, assured PolCouns 
during an April 23 meeting that a representative of the 
Government of Tanzania (GOT) would attend the International 
Contact Group (ICG) on Somalia meeting in Oslo scheduled for 
April 30.  Lyimo appreciated the points on the consensus that 
had been reached regarding the need to restructure the ICG 
and the proposed role of the UN Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General.  However, he inquired whether the 
 
SIPDIS 
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) had also 
been consulted and agreed with the suggestions put forth by 
the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway and the 
European Commission during their recent discussions. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post would appreciate guidance in responding to the 
GOT's inquiry.  Lyimo promised before April 30 to forward to 
the Embassy the name of the Tanzanian representative who will 
attend the Oslo meeting.
