(U)  Tanzania is unable to send from capital instructions 
concerning the draft UN Security Council resolution on 
Lebanon on August 6, Ambassador Liberata Mulamula, Director 
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Multilateral Division, 
told Poloff the morning of August 6.  However, Mulamula 
stressed that the draft text contains important elements, 
including those which Tanzania has been emphasizing:  the 
cessation of hostilities; a ceasefire; an international force 
to act as a separation force under a ceasefire; and 
implementation of resolution 1559.  Mulamula said that the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Asha-Rose Migiro, is 
involved in the review of the draft text and Mulamula set a 
meeting with Poloff for the morning of August 7.
