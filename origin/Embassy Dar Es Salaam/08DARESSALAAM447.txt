SUBJECT:  TANZANIA OPPOSES ICC INDICTMENT OF PRESIDENT BASHIR 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bernard Membe, 
spoke out at France's national day reception on July 14 against the 
request for the prosecutors of the International Criminal Court 
(ICC) to indict Sudan's President Omar Bashir for genocide.  Membe 
said that such a move could lead to instability in the region and 
invite chaos.  He called upon the court to stay its hand and for the 
U.N. Security Council to use its influence to prevent any ICC action 
against President Bashir at this time.  On July 15, Membe held a 
joint press conference with the Sudanese ambassador to Tanzania to 
elaborate on the Government of Tanzania's (GOT) position.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
Surprise Bastille Day Announcement 
---------------------------------- 
¶2. (U) Many of the assembled guests of the French Ambassador to 
Tanzania were taken by surprise during the France's National Day 
Celebration by the comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and 
International Cooperation, Bernard Membe.  Minister Membe appeared 
at the event to issue the customary congratulations from the GOT to 
the French on their National Day.  While he began his remarks by 
initially praising the decision announced earlier that day by the 
International Criminal Court (ICC) to indict Sudan President Omar 
Hassan al-Bashir on charges of genocide, he unexpectedly turned his 
remarks into criticism of the move, going on to say that this move 
would most certainly lead to "chaos for the region." 
 
Membe's Press Conference with Sudanese Ambassador 
--------------------------------------------- 
¶3. (U) On July 15, a joint press conference was called at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MFA) with 
Minister Membe and Sudan's ambassador to Tanzania, Abdel Bagi 
Kabeir.  Membe said President Kikwete, after in depth discussions 
with African Union (AU) members, had determined that this is not the 
right time to indict President Bashir.  Membe said President 
Kikwete's view is that this action would create a leadership vacuum 
in Sudan which could lead to more bloodshed.  Membe actually 
described the situation as akin to the situation in Iraq.  He also 
mentioned the unlikelihood of the Sudanese people handing over their 
president to the ICC and that the resulting "tug of war" would lead 
to chaos and violence. 
 
¶4. (U) Minister Membe cited the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that 
the Sudanese government signed with the Sudan People's Liberation 
Army (SPLA) as an example of a positive step already taken towards 
solving the problems in Sudan.  He said that this step was moving 
Sudan towards new elections, a new parliament, and a new government 
in the very near future.  Membe feared the arrest of President 
Bashir would only serve to escalate violence in the region spreading 
from Darfur to southern Sudan.  He also predicted an invasion by 
Chad by those who would take advantage of the ensuing chaos. 
 
¶5. (U) Membe also noted that the position of the African Union was 
that the ICC judges should not only consider the evidence against 
President Bashir in their decision for indictment, but they should 
also consider the circumstances in Sudan and order the postponement 
of the indictment proceedings.  He said that President Kikwete would 
ask that the international community wait for the results of the 
ongoing efforts to help Sudan bring about stability through new 
elections, the formation of a new parliament, and the establishment 
of a new government, all of which were already in the implementation 
stage.  Minister Membe added that he would also ask the UN Security 
Council to review the proposed indictment by applying Article 16 of 
the Rome Statute in order to postpone the arrest. 
 
¶6. (U) Sudan's Ambassador Kabeir said that it was highly unusual for 
the International Criminal Court (ICC) to indict a sitting 
president, and one who had been fully cooperative with the 
international community.  He said that this move totally disregarded 
the positive progress that had been achieved in recent months in 
Sudan.  It was his view that the ICC was designed to step in where 
there is a failed state situation with no working judicial system, 
which is not the case for Sudan. 
 
¶7. (U) Ambassador Kabeir added that Sudan is not a ratified member 
of the ICC and therefore the ICC had no jurisdiction in this matter. 
 He said that Sudan had issued a limited appeal to the African Union 
(AU) to mediate the conflict in Sudan and therefore would now appeal 
to Tanzania, as the Chair of the African Union, for its assistance 
in objecting to this move by the ICC.
