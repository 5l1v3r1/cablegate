1.(SBU) SUMMARY: Russian FM Lavrov made no commitments on a 
possible Russian veto of a Kosovo UNSC resolution in meetings 
April 20 with the Government of Montenegro. The GoM would prefer 
that the EU "speak with a unified voice, with a single position" 
on Kosovo -- and the GoM will join the EU position, regardless 
whether that position is for or against the Ahtisaari plan. The 
GoM believes a Russian veto would have serious negative 
consequences for the region, and would prefer a three-to-six 
month delay if needed to avoid a veto. Lavrov said Russia had 
"no objections" to Montenegro seeking NATO membership.  End 
summary. 
 
 
 
FM Lavrov - No Signals For, Against Veto on Kosovo 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) MFA acting State Secretary Vladimir Radulovic told 
poloff April 24 that in his meetings with the GoM April 20, FM 
Lavrov indicated "neither a 'yes' nor a 'no'" as to whether the 
GoR would veto a UNSC resolution on Kosovo. Lavrov did express 
concern that any Kosovo resolution would be a precedent for 
other situations, if only a precedent in fact and not law. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Radulovic said the GoM message to the GoR and USG was 
the same on Kosovo. The GoM did not believe the situation could 
be "prolonged endlessly,' that a resolution was needed. 
Preferably, that solution would be acceptable to both Belgrade 
and Pristina, said Radulovic, but as that was not the case, the 
GoM supported that the decision was in the hands of the UNSC. A 
Russian veto, however, would have "negative consequences" for 
the region including Montenegro, Radulovic citing refugee flows 
and potential violence in Kosovo. Even though it prefers a rapid 
resolution, the GoM could tolerate a three-to-six month delay in 
reaching a UNSC resolution, if the time was needed to avoid a 
Russian veto, added Radulovic. 
 
 
 
¶4. (U) Radulovic dismissed as "ridiculous" an opposition 
suggestion that the GoM support the GoS position on Kosovo. 
Rather, the GoM will advance "European values", which he said 
were increasingly Montenegrin values. He dismissed the 
possibility that Montenegro could influence the Kosovo decision. 
Consequently, the GoM was looking for a unified EU position on 
the Ahtisaari plan, which they would adopt and support. 
Radulovic said the exact position, for or against, was less 
significant than the unanimity of the EU states. He said that 
this followed from the GoM foreign policy priorities, which he 
said were "stability, peace, and prosperity in the region," 
combined with the GoM goals of European and Euro-Atlantic 
integration.

¶5. (U) FM Lavrov told the GoM that Russia "understands 
Montenegro NATO aspirations," said Radulovic. Lavrov observed 
that for Montenegro and the western Balkans, NATO membership was 
a factor in internal and regional stability, a contributor to 
economic development and democracy. Radulovic said Lavrov 
observed that NATO membership was additionally a route by which 
the region could avoid repeating the history of the past 15 or 
even 100 years. 
 
Radulovic said Lavrov therefore had "no objections" to 
Montenegro's desire to join NATO.
