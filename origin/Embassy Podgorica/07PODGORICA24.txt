¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  THE RUSSIAN PRESENCE ON MONTENEGRO IS 
VISIBLE, YET OFTEN OVERSTATED BY MONTENEGRINS AND OUTSIDERS 
ALIKE. SINCE 1999, REPORTED RUSSIAN FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT 
(FDI) HAS AMOUNTED TO EUROS 135 MILLION, OUT OF A TOTAL OF 
NEARLY EUROS 1 BILLION.  THROUGH THE END OF 2006, THE ONLY LARGE 
FDI FROM RUSSIA WAS KAP.  RUSSIA HAS HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON 
MONTENEGROS BROADER POLICY DIRECTION, WITH APPEALS FOR SLAVIC 
SOLIDARITY FROM SERVING RUSSIAN MINISTERS AND THE CONSUL GENERAL 
EQUALLY REBUFFED, AS PODGORICA PURSUES PFP, NATO, WTO AND THE 
EU.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
RUSSIAN SHARE OF FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) FROM JANUARY 2001 THROUGH NOVEMBER 2006, FOREIGN DIRECT 
INVESTMENT (FDI) IN MONTENEGRO TOTALED EUROS 995 MILLION. (FDI 
PRIOR TO 2001 WAS ESSENTIALLY NON-EXISTENT, DUE TO CONFLICT AND 
SANCTIONS.) RUSSIAN FDI AMOUNTED TO EUROS 135 MILLION, 13.5 
PERCENT OF THE TOTAL. THIS IS VASTLY LOWER THAN THE REPORTED 
ESTIMATE OF RUSSIAN PM PUTIN WHO CLAIMED EUROS 2 BILLION OF 
RUSSIAN INVESTMENT IN MONTENEGRO (AS REPORTED IN U.S. MEDIA IN 
LATE 2006). BEFORE REAL ESTATE SALES (INCLUDED IN GOM FDI 
STATISTICS) TOOK OFF IN 2006, RUSSIAN INVESTMENT WAS SEVEN 
PERCENT OF THE TOTAL FDI, AND PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO RUSAL'S 
PURCHASE OF KOMBINAT ALUMINA PODGORICA (KAP - ALUMINUM FACTORY) 
AND THE RELATED BAUXITE MINES NEAR NIKSIC. (REF A) MIDLANDS 
INDUSTRY, A UK-BASED BUT RUSSIAN-OWNED FIRM, WALKED AWAY FROM 
ITS 2004 ACQUISITION OF THE NIKSIC STEEL WORKS IN LATE 2005. IT 
HAD PAID THE NOMINAL SUM OF 1000 EUROS FOR THE PLANT BUT PROVED 
UNWILLING TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS CALLED FOR BY THE CONTRACT. 
 
 
 
RUSSIANS, BRITISH, EVEN SWISS (SORT OF) IN LAND RUSH 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) THE PAST YEAR SAW SALES OF MONTENEGRIN REAL ESTATE, 
PARTICULARLY ALONG THE WATERFRONT, EXPLODE TO FOREIGNERS: EUROS 
278.4 MILLION IN THE FIRST ELEVEN MONTHS, COMPARED TO EUROS 42.5 
MILLION IN 2005, ACCORDING TO CENTRAL BANK OF MONTENEGRO (CBCG) 
STATISTICS. IN 2006, RUSSIANS BOUGHT PROPERTY WORTH EUROS 51.8 
MILLION, AND IN 2005 THEY SPENT EUROS 12.3 MILLION; OVERALL, 19 
PERCENT OF THE TOTAL FOR BOTH YEARS. IN 2005 AND 2006, THE 
BRITISH BOUGHT LAND VALUED AT EUROS 55.8 FOR 17.4 PERCENT OF ALL 
FOREIGN SALES.  QUIETLY, "SWISS" MONEY BOUGHT REAL ESTATE 
VALUING EUROS 56.8 IN THE SAME PERIOD, OR 17.6 PERCENT.  U.S. 
PURCHASERS SPENT EUROS 1.4 MILLION IN 2005 AND 15.7 MILLION IN 
2006 (5.3 PERCENT). (NOTES: BASED ON DISCUSSION WITH LOCAL 
OFFICIALS, MOST OF THE "SWISS" BUYERS ARE PROBABLY KOSOVAR 
EMIGRES. STATISTICS DO NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SALES OF 
COMMERCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL REAL PROPERTY. END NOTE.) 
 
 
 
RUSSIAN OLIGARCH BUYS HEAVY INDUSTRIAL PLANT 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) RUSAL, NOW THE WORLD'S LARGEST ALUMINUM PRODUCER HEADED 
RUSSIAN OLEG DERIPASKA, PURCHASED THE KOMBINAT ALUMINA PODGORICA 
(KAP - ALUMINUM FACTORY) AND THE RELATED BAUXITE MINES NEAR 
NIKSIC IN LATE 2005, PAYING EUROS 48.5 MILLION KAP, AND EUROS 9 
MILLION FOR THE MINES.  THE PRIVATIZATION AND SALE OF KAP, WHOSE 
REVENUES AT THE TIME EQUALED 12 PERCENT OF MONTENEGRO'S GDP, WAS 
STEEPED IN CONTROVERSY (REF A).  KAP'S SHARE OF GDP IS 
RELATIVELY STEADY, AT 14 PERCENT IN 2006, RESULTING FROM STRONG 
GLOBAL AND LOCAL PRICES FOR ALUMINUM. DATA ON KAPS PRODUCTION 
AND REVENUE FOR 2006 IS NOT YET PUBLICLY AVAILABLE, AND THE NEW 
OWNERS HAVE DISCONTINUED PROVIDING INFORMATION TO THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC ABOUT THEIR OPERATIONS. INFORMATION PROVIDED TO POST IN 
FEBRUARY 2007 IS THAT KAP PRODUCED 121,322 TONNES OF ALUMINUM IN

2006, AND HAD REVENUES OF USD 325,176,688 ON SALES OF 121,410 
TONNES OF ALUMINUM. IN 2004 KAP REALIZED EUROS 200 MILLION IN 
REVENUE ON SALES OF 120,000 TONNES. 
 
 
 
RUSSIAN INVESTMENT IN TOURISM 
 
----------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶5. (U) WHILE RUSSIANS ARE NOT MAJOR INVESTORS IN MONTENEGROS 
TOURISM SECTOR, THEIR HOLDINGS ARE PROMINENT.  THE HOTEL 
SPLENDID IN BECICI (NEAR BUDVA) UNDERWENT MASSIVE RECONSTRUCTION 
AFTER IT WAS ACQUIRED FROM THE GOVERNMENT FOR EUROS 2.4 MILLION 
IN LATE 2003 TO A GROUP OF RUSSIAN AND MONTENEGRIN INVESTORS: 
MONTENEGRO STARS GROUP.  MONTENEGRO STARS OWNS THREE HOTELS NEAR 
BUDVA (THE OTHERS BEING HOTEL MONTENEGRO AND HOTEL BLUE STAR), 
BUT IT IS THE SPLENDID THAT IS THE 800-POUND GORILLA ON THE 
BEACH, AND WHICH WAS SUBJECTED TO A BOMBING CAMPAIGN BY 
ORGANIZED CRIME ELEMENTS SEEKING TO EXTORT MONEY DURING ITS 
RECONSTRUCTION. (CF. U.S. MEDIA DECEMBER 2006)  THE CHIEF OF THE 
MONTENEGRIN POLICE WAS ASSASSINATED IN AUGUST 2005 WHILE 
INVESTIGATING THE BOMBINGS AND OTHER ALLEGEDLY RELATED CRIMES 
(REF B).  IN THE PAST MONTH, LOCAL MEDIA HAS REPORTED THAT THE 
RUSSIAN COMPANY "VAS INVEST MONTENEGRO" PAID EUROS 25 MILLION 
FOR 13 HECTARES OF "WASTELAND" SOUTH OF BUDVA, WITH THE GOAL OF 
BUILDING A HOTEL AND TOURIST VILLAS. THERE ARE NO OTHER MAJOR 
TOURISM INVESTMENTS FROM RUSSIA IN MONTENEGRO AT PRESENT. (NOTE: 
THE RECENT 30-YEAR LEASE OF SVETI STEFAN TO SINGAPORE'S AMAN 
RESORTS WILL ENTAIL AMAN PAYING AT LEAST EUROS 2.1 MILLION 
ANNUALLY IN RENT, PLUS MAKE EUROS 40 MILLION IN IMPROVEMENTS. 
END NOTE.) 
 
 
 
MONTENEGRO-RUSSIA BANKING CONNECTIONS 
 
------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶6. (U) THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF MONTENEGRO'S 
BANKS, BUT COMING FROM FRANCE (PODGORICKA BANK - 1ST IN SIZE), 
SLOVENIA (MONTENEGRO BANKA - WHICH EARLIER ABSORBED EUROMARKET 
BANKA - 2ND IN SIZE), THE U.S. (OPPORTUNITY BANK - 3RD IN SIZE), 
HUNGARY (CRNOGORSKA KOMERCIJALNA BANKA - CVB - 4TH), AND AUSTRIA 
(HYPO-ALPO-ADRIA - 5TH). RUSSIA HAS MADE NO INVESTMENTS IN 
MONTENEGRO'S FINANCIAL SECTOR. CONVERSELY, THE SMALLER ATLASMONT 
BANKA, DOMESTICALLY OWNED, HAS A REPRESENTATIVE IN MOSCOW. 
 
 
 
MONEY LAUNDERING 
 
---------------- 
 
 
 
¶7. (U) PM PUTIN'S REPORTED COMMENT THAT RUSSIANS HAVE INVESTED 
EUROS 2 BILLION HERE CONTRASTS WITH THE 135 MILLION REPORTED TO 
THE CENTRAL BANK OF MONTENEGRO (CBCG).  MONTENEGRO, THROUGH ITS 
STATE PROSECUTOR FOR ORGANIZED CRIME AND ITS ADMINISTRATION FOR 
THE PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING (FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT 
- FIU), HAS CRACKED DOWN ON MONEY LAUNDERING, AND RUSSIANS HAVE 
BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THEIR NETS.  IN DECEMBER, TWO RUSSIANS 
(REPORTED AS SERGEJ ILIN, AGE 47, AND JOSIF KARMAH, AGE 45) WERE 
ARRESTED ON MONEY LAUNDERING CHARGES AT THE PODGORICA AIRPORT AS 
THEY TRIED TO EXIT WITH EUROS 790,000 IN CASH; REPORTEDLY, THEY 
HAD BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL IN THEIR EFFORTS TO BUY REAL ESTATE.  ON 
FEBRUARY 1, THE STATE PROSECUTOR FOR ORGANIZED CRIME ANNOUNCED 
THE ARREST OF FOUR RUSSIAN CITIZENS (NFI) FOR ATTEMPTING TO 
LAUNDER EUROS 2.5 MILLION DERIVED FROM FOREIGN CRIMINAL 
ACTIVITIES THROUGH LOCAL BANK ACCOUNTS OF "STOREFRONT" LOCAL 
COMPANIES. 
 
 
 
GOR SEEKS INFLUENCE, GETS PRESS ATTENTION 
 
----------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶8. (U) THE GOR WOULD LIKE TO RESTORE ITS INFLUENCE IN 
MONTENEGRO; BEFORE 1914, MONTENEGRO'S CLOSEST OFFICIAL TIES WERE 
WITH RUSSIA, AND INCLUDED MARRIAGES BETWEEN THE RESPECTIVE ROYAL

FAMILIES. RECENT COMMENTS AND ACTIONS BY GOR OFFICIALS HAVE DONE 
MORE TO IRRITATE MONTENEGRINS THAN BUILD FRIENDSHIPS, HOWEVER. 
ON AUGUST 8, AFTER MEETING WITH THEN-PM DJUKANOVIC, RUSSIA'S 
MINISTER FOR EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS, SERGEY SHOIGU, GAVE AN 
INTERVIEW TO THE LEADING LOCAL PAPER. HIS "WARNING" THAT 
MONTENEGRO RISKED ITS FRIENDSHIP WITH RUSSIA IF IT CONTINUED TO 
PURSUE TIES WITH NATO IRRITATED A BROAD RANGE OF THE MONTENEGRIN 
PUBLIC, AND DID NOTHING TO DETER THE GOM FROM SEEKING AND 
GAINING MEMBERSHIP IN NATOS PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE IN DECEMBER. 
ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS CONFIRMED BY CONTACTS IN THE GOM, PM 
DJUKANOVIC DISCUSSED A DEFENSE RELATIONSHIP WITH PM PUTIN IN 
THEIR LATE AUGUST MEETING IN SOCHII, BUT APPARENTLY NOTHING HAS 
COME OF THAT TALK, WHILE THE GOM IS IN CLOSE CONSULTATIONS WITH 
BOTH NATO AND THE USG ON PLANNING ITS NATIONAL SECURITY AND 
DEFENSE POLICIES. 
 
 
 
¶9. (U) OTHER GOR OFFICIALS HAVE SMUDGED RUSSIA'S IMAGE IN 
MONTENEGRO AS WELL. IN APRIL 2005 THE FORMER CONSUL GENERAL GAVE 
A SCATHING INTERVIEW TO THE LOCAL OPPOSITION PAPER, CRITICIZING 
MONTENEGRO'S CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE USG, WHICH PROMPTED THE 
FM TO CONVOKE THE CG (REF C). IN 2006, THE RUSSIAN PRESS ATTACHE 
WAS WHISKED OUT OF MONTENEGRO AFTER HIS CAR CRASHED INTO ANOTHER 
IN PODGORICA, KILLING THREE MONTENEGRINS; LOCAL MEDIA 
HIGHLIGHTED THE STORY, PARTICULARLY REPORTS THAT THE ATTACHE WAS 
DRUNK AND SPEEDING. IN HERCEG NOVI, LOCAL MEDIA IN LATE JANUARY 
REPORTED PUBLIC ANGER AT THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW, JURIJ LUSKOV, WHO 
HAS CLOSED A TIME-HONORED EASEMENT ACROSS PROPERTY HE RECENTLY 
PURCHASED THERE, PRECLUDING ACCESS TO THE BEACH. (LUSKOV 
PUBLICLY SUPPORTED MONTENEGRIN INDEPENDENCE IN THE RUN-UP TO 
LAST MAY'S VOTE.) 
 
 
 
NOTE ON SOURCES 
 
--------------- 
 
 
 
¶10. (U) STATISTICS IN THIS REPORT COME FROM THE CENTRAL BANK OF 
MONTENEGRO AND THE GOM'S MONTENEGRO INVESTMENT PROMOTION AGENCY 
(MIPA). FDI IN MONTENEGRIN STATISTICS INCLUDES SALES OF 
COMPANIES AND REAL ESTATE, ALTHOUGH REAL ESTATE WAS A SMALL 
COMPONENT OF FDI PRIOR TO 2006. 
 
 
 
COMMENT 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶11. (SBU) THE RUSSIAN PRESENCE IN MONTENEGRO IS NOTICEABLE, BUT 
HAS TO DATE NOT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE. NOR IS THE 
PRESENCE AS LARGE AS OFTEN REPORTED. CONTRARY TO POPULAR 
PERCEPTION, KAP WAS NOT MONTENEGRO'S LARGEST PRIVATIZATION. 
PROMONTE (TELECOMMUNICATIONS) WAS PURCHASED BY NORWAY'S TELENOR 
FOR EUROS 116 MILLION IN 2004.  HUNGARY'S MATAV RT BOUGHT PRO 
MONTES COMPETITOR TELEKOM CG IN 2005 FOR EUROS 114 MILLION, AND 
HELLENIC PETROLEUM BOUGHT JUGOPETROL AD KOTOR IN 2002 FOR EUROS 
100.5 MILLION. OVERALL, SLOVENIA HAS MADE THE LARGEST 
INVESTMENTS IN MONTENEGRO; RUSSIA IS SEVENTH. 
 
 
 
¶12. (SBU) STORIES ABOUT MYSTERIOUS RUSSIAN MAFIA OR BUSINESSMEN 
(USUALLY SEEN AS THE SAME THING IN LOCAL POPULAR CULTURE) SELL, 
AND CONTRIBUTE TO AN EXAGGERATED PERCEPTION OF A LARGE RUSSIAN 
PRESENCE.  ADDITIONALLY, THE OPPOSITION AND OTHERS ARE KEEN TO 
PORTRAY THE GOM AS CORRUPT, AND PORTRAYING GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
AS TURNING A BLIND EYE TO, OR EVEN BEING IN COLLUSION WITH, 
RUSSIAN BUSINESSMEN WHO CAN BE PORTRAYED AS UNIFORMLY CORRUPT 
AND CORRUPTING. THE RECENT ARRESTS UNDERSCORE THE POPULAR 
PERCEPTION OF A LARGE AND SHADOWY RUSSIAN PRESENCE.  POST VIEWS 
THE ARRESTS AS A POSITIVE INDICATOR, CONTRIBUTING TO ITS 
CONFIDENCE THAT THE GOM'S PRO-WESTERN POLICIES, AND MONTENEGRO'S 
COMMITMENT AT ALL LEVELS TO A FREE MARKET ECONOMY, COUPLED WITH 
MEDIA REPORTING, COULD SERVE AS A CHECK ON EXCESSIVE RUSSIAN 
INFLUENCE IN MONTENEGRO.  END COMMENT.
