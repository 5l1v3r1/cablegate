SUBJECT: VENEZUELA'S NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL REQUESTS 
LOCAL TV STATIONS STOP AIRING ANTI-CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM 
ADS 
 
¶1.  (U)   The Directors of Globovision, Alberto Federico 
Ravell, and Venezolana de TeleVision (VTV), Romero Anselmi, 
met with the President of the National Electoral Council 
(CNE), Tibisay Lucena, October 17 to counter CNE efforts to 
suspend the transmission of spots critical of the 
government's proposed constitutional reforms.  The CNE 
asserts these spots are premature. Ravell, argues that they 
do not endorse a position, but rather serve to educate 
Venezuelans.  The CNE, however, was unconvinced and issued a 
formal request on October 20 to stop broadcasting the 
messages.  Ciudadania Activa, the NGO that produces these 
spots, has vowed to continue to air the ads via the internet 
and to pass them out directly to the public. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Comment.  The CNE's partisanship is blatant given 
the fact that Venezuelans are bombarded daily with government 
propaganda promoting the Chavez Administration and his 
constitutional reforms.  The government obviously has little 
interest in fostering genuine debate about the constitutional 
reforms.  End Comment.
