¶1.  (U)  SUMMARY: During the past year President Chavez has 
undertaken an extensive dollar-diplomacy campaign to win 
friends and influence countries in the region and beyond. 
Two recent studies, drawn from Chavez' announcements, place 
BRV public commitments of support (donations, discounts, 
government procurements, barter, financing, and investment 
projects) over this period at USD 16.4 billion and USD 25.8 
billion, respectively.  While BRV non-transparency makes it 
very difficult to assess the accuracy of these numbers, we 
estimate the BRV provided to other countries roughly USD 4-5 
billion in sweetheart deals, financial support, and 
investments -- mostly to Cuba and Argentina.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------- 
LATIN-AMERICAN COMMITMENTS 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Julio Borges, former National Assembly Deputy for the 
State of Miranda (2001-2005) and current Primero Justicia 
presidential candidate, criticized the BRV for "giving away" 
a reported USD 16.4 billion to 35 countries during 2005 and 
the beginning of 2006.  The Center for Economic Investigation 
(CIECA), a private consulting firm, puts the giveaway at USD 
25.8 billion over the past seven months.  CIECA's inclusion 
of USD 10 billion for the Fund Against Poverty, which Chavez 
announced in November 2005 but never established, largely 
explains the difference in totals.  While the two studies 
suffer from extreme imprecision, they provide a good profile 
of Chavez' international financial promises (many of which 
have not been executed) and have drawn public criticism 
given deteriorating infrastructure and unmet social needs at 
home. 
 
¶3.  (U)  While the accounting is very imprecise, the studies 
do include examples of tangible Venezuelan assistance to Cuba 
and Argentina.  The largest support to Cuba was oil; 98,000 
barrels daily (USD 1.764 billion annually) per Borges or 
95,000 barrels daily (USD 2 billion annually) per CIECA 
(note: this is in exchange for roughly 20 thousand Cuban 
medical personnel supporting the BRV missions. end note). 
Both studies list Industrial Bank of Venezuela (BIV) 
financing for Cuba, which we understand to be mainly loan 
guarantees.  Both studies also reported that Venezuela 
purchased USD 1 billion in Argentine debt and the BRV 
committed to buy an additional USD 2.4 billion.  (Note: 
according to press reports the BRV purchased USD 2.8 billion 
in Argentine debt from May 2005 to March 2006, although it 
has resold a substantial portion of the debt.)  Both studies 
include the barter of Venezuela oil for Argentine meat and 
industrial products, the purchase of a refinery, as well as 
agreement (not yet executed) to purchase Argentinian-built 
petroleum tankers.  We estimate that assistance to Cuba was 
roughly USD 1.8 billion (mostly oil) and financial support to 
Argentina (mostly debt purchase) was USD 990 million from 
May-December 2005, increasing to USD 2.8 billion by March 
¶2006. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Venezuela's yet unrealized commitment to purchase 
petroleum tankers from Brazil and the proposed construction 
of the PDVSA-Petrobras refinery in Pernambuco, Brazil are 
highlighted in both studies.  CIECA counts Venezuela's 
commitment to buy 28 tankers from Brazil (USD 3 billion), as 
compared to Borges' count of 40 tankers (USD 2 billion). 
Borges places the construction cost of the refinery in 
Pernambuco at USD 2.5 billion, as compared to CIECA's and our 
estimate of USD 1.25 billion.  It is premature to determine 
the likelihood of implementation of agreements for Paraguay, 
Uraguay, and Bolivia, announced in December 2005 and January 
¶2006.  These include oil at barter and preferential terms, 
scholarships for students from rural areas, and loans for 
hospital equipment. 
 
¶5.  (U)  Neither study includes Chavez' proposed USD 20 
billion 9,000 km natural gas pipeline from Venezuela to 
Argentina.  Critics charge that the pipeline is not feasible 
because Venezuela does not have sufficient gas to pump to 
meet regional demand.  The delivery of the gas over such a 
long distance would also be prohibitively expensive and cause 
considerable environmental damage to the Amazon rain forest. 
 
------------------ 
WORLD-WIDE SUPPORT 
------------------ 
 
¶6.  (U) Chavez also reached out to the U.S., the Caribbean, 
and as far as Indonesia, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, and 
Niger.  As part of the BRV diplomatic strategy to lobby the 
U.S. public, Venezuela donated heating oil for poor residents 
in Boston, New York, Chicago, Rhode Island, Vermont, and 
Maine (worth USD 200 million per CIECA or USD 10 million per 
Borges).  Venezuela also sold oil at preferential terms to 
the Caribbean (worth USD 536 million per CIECA or USD 742 
million per Borges), in an effort to win support within the 
Organization of American States.  Assistance to Mali, Burkina 
Faso, and Niger was reportedly humanitarian aide and food, 
however, the BRV cannot fully account for the funds directed 
to support aid to Africa.  However, in November 2005, the BRV 
could not confirm how much of the aid to Africa had been 
obligated for the purchase of medical and food supplies 
(reftel).  In Indonesia, the BRV will reportedly support the 
construction of an educational center.

COMMENT

¶9.  (SBU)  To date, Chavez' give-away campaign has been much 
more rhetoric than dollars; however, in several specific 
cases we are talking real money, such as Cuba, Argentina, and 
perhaps Bolivia.  In other cases, the public perception is 
that Chavez is giving away free oil, money, or supplies, when 
he actually only promises a discount, generous financing, a 
purchase, or an investment.  Whether all this translates into 
eventual strengthened concrete political support or countries 
will simply take the money, smile and run is an open question. 
 
¶10. (SBU)  However, by the end of 2006, we estimate the BRV's 
National Development Fund (FONDEN) will have received USD 17 
billion in transfers from the BRV (read: Central Bank and 
PDVSA transfers), some of which Chavez could divert to 
support his diplomatic initiatives without any effective 
public scrutiny or oversight.  The BRV could strategically 
deposit or "invest" FONDEN funds (as it reportedly did to 
purchase Argentine bonds), purchase imports from targeted 
countries (e.g., products potentially displaced by U.S.-third 
country FTAs such as Bolivian soybeans), or directly fund 
various projects abroad.
