¶1.  On April 2, local media reported that Paraguayan Foreign 
Minister Ruben Ramirez expressed Paraguay's support for 
Venezuela's full membership into the Common Market of the 
South (MERCOSUR), during his recent trip to Caracas. 
According to ABN, the official BRV news agency, during the 
signing of food and energy cooperation agreements April 1, 
2007 with BRV Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro, Ramirez said 
"since Venezuela is an energy power and plays a leading role 
in regional issues, it is essential for MERCOSUR to admit 
Venezuela as a full member".  Ramirez also reportedly stated 
that the Paraguayan President Nicanor Duarte "is a firm 
supporter of Venezuela's MERCOSUR membership". 
 
¶2.  In July 2006, MERCOSUR's member states, Argentina, 
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay signed a protocol to admit 
Venezuela as a full member, but Venezuela needs the 
legislative bodies of the member states to approve the 
protocol.  Neither Paraguay's and Brazil's legislative bodies 
have approved the protocol.  According to Ramirez the 
Paraguayan parliament is discussing the issue and the 
government of Paraguay is urging approval of Venezuela's 
membership.
