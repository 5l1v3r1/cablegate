¶1.  (U)  This information was previously reported in a 
classified cable on September 14.  This information is 
unclassified. 
 
¶2.  (U)  On September 12, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck 
the coast of Venezuela at approximately 3:36 PM local time, 
according to the Venezuelan Seismological Foundation 
(FUNVISI).  FUNVISI reported that the earthquake's epicenter 
was 100 kilometers west of Caracas, off the coast of Carabobo 
state.  Francisco Garces, President of FUNVISI, told 
reporters that geologists expect additional earthquakes in 
the coming weeks as tectonic plates continue to adjust. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Press reports indicate that the most extensive 
damage occurred in Falcon state.  At a press conference on 
September 13, the National Director of Civil Protection, Luis 
Diaz Curbelo, said that 15 people were injured in Falcon, 
including one girl who jumped from her balcony.  Interior 
Minister Tarek El Aissami told the press that the quake 
damaged 17 houses and two buildings there.  Curbelo said 
FUNVISI planned to inspect the safety of buildings affected 
by the quake. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Curbelo said no injuries had been reported in 
Caracas, although the earthquake damaged the dome of the 
National Pantheon.  However, heavy rains in the capital on 
the same day dumped 45 to 60 liters of water per square meter 
on the city, according to newspaper reports, with flooding 
blocking off several neighborhoods and leaving some residents 
without water or electricity. 
 
¶5.  (U)  During his Sunday "Hello, President" television and 
radio program, President Hugo Chavez acknowledged the 
strength of the earthquake and asked for God's continued 
assistance.  "I didn't jump from the balcony, but it moved 
everything; the wood on the floor creaked," he said.
