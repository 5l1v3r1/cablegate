CHLORIDE 
 
REF: CARACAS 1614 
 
¶1. (U)  Post received the following letter (see Para 2) on 
June 1 from the BRV Ministry of Light Industry and Commerce's 
Antidumping and Subsidies Commission (CASS), notifying its 
final decision on existing antidumping orders for two 
varieties of polyvinyl chloride (Ref A).  The CASS decision 
was to extend the validity of antidumping rights for unmixed 
polyvinyl chloride obtained through polymerization in 
suspension, but to allow the expiration of antidumping rights 
for polyvinyl chloride obtained through emulsion.  The full 
text of the decision, in Spanish, is available from EconOff 
Isabel Rioja-Scott (Rioja-ScottIE@state.gov).

attached document, as part of this notification, the Decision 
No. CASS-ADP-002/06 dated 29 May, 2006, through which the 
Antidumping and Subsidies Commission decided, on one hand, to 
extend the validity of the definitive antidumping right ad 
valorem imposed upon the imports of polyvinyl chloride not 
mixed with other substances obtained through polymerization 
in suspension, identified in the Customs Duties of Venezuela 
under subchapter 3904.10.20, originating from the United 
States of America, regardless of the sender country and on 
the other hand, to not extend the definitive antidumping 
right ad valorem imposed on the imports of polyvinyl chloride 
not mixed with other substances obtained through 
polymerization in emulsion, identified in the Customs Duties 
of Venezuela under subchapter 3904.10.10, originating in the 
United States regardless of sender country. 
 
In this regard, we inform you that said rights were 
originally established by Decision No 001/00 dated April 7, 
2000, and published in the Official Gazette of the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela No 5461 Extraordinary, on April 27,
