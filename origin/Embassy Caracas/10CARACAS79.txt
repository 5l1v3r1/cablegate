¶1. (SBU) Caracas EAC convened on 01/12/2010 to discuss STATE 2602 
and to review the current threat environment following the shooting 
incident on 01/09/2010 at Valle Arriba Commercial Center and the 
ongoing effects of electricity and water rationing within Caracas 
and the entire country.  EAC members in attendance included CDA, 
RSO, CONS, FAS, LEGATT, DHS, DEA, FCS, MGT, CLO, PAS, POL, ECON, 
DAO/MILGRP, and ORA. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) EAC members discussed Reftel A and the events surrounding 
the Christmas Day Airline Bombing.  EAC reviewed the Visa Viper 
meeting schedule for Caracas and determined that the monthly 
meetings were adequate for post.  In addition EAC members affirmed 
their commitment to hold additional Visa Viper meetings as needed 
on a case-by-case basis at the request of any Visa Viper Group 
member. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Per Reftel B, RSO briefed the EAC on the shooting 
incident at Valle Arriba Market and status of the police 
investigation.  Local police investigating the incident, reported 
that it was a botched robbery attempt for an expensive watch.  The 
three victims had been treated and should make full recoveries. 
Police report capturing one of the perpetrators and know the 
identity of the shooter but continue to search for him.  RSO 
informed the EAC that the Embassy Emergency SMS text messaging 
system is ready for testing and requested that CLO collect cell 
phone numbers of all Embassy family members to add to the system. 
An Embassy wide test will be conducted by the end of the month.  In 
addition several EAC members requested additional information on a 
rumored robbery last week at another restaurant in the Valle Arriba 
Commercial Center and RSO confirmed that she would contact the 
Baruta police for more details and RSO would send out an Embassy 
Security Notice providing details and recommendations to the 
Embassy community (Notice sent on January 14). 
 
 
 
4)  (SBU) Finally the EAC reviewed the implications of a breakdown 
in the supply of electricity and water in Caracas. The EAC 
discussed how the lack of electricity would affect the safety of 
personnel.  RSO reviewed Post's residential security measures and 
confirmed that residential alarms would continue to work during 
short blackouts and Embassy local guard roving patrols would 
respond to emergencies.  RSO and Management will continue to 
monitor the situation and review capacities and tripwires will be 
drafted and presented at an EAC meeting to be held at a later date. 
After this EAC meeting, President Chavez suspended electricity 
rationing in Caracas, for the time being.  The EAC will continue to 
monitor the situation.
