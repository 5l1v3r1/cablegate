SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST: CLOSURE OF VMAO 
 
REF: CARACAS 00423 
 
Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Daniel Lawton 
for Reason 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) This is an Action Request -- see Paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. (C) Post requested February 28 guidance on the status of 
the Venezuelan Air Force's purchases currently in the 
pipeline and regarding the removal of items in the Venezuelan 
Military Acquisitions Office (VMAO) in Miami, Florida.  Based 
on subsequent discussions, Post believes that the best way to 
proceed with the permanent closure of the VMAO is for the 
Department to deliver a diplomatic note to the Embassy of the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 
 
¶3. (C) Action recommendation: Post suggests that the 
Department consider delivering a diplomatic note to the 
Embassy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in order to 
expedite the closure of the VMAO.  Post recommended language 
follows: 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
Complementary opening,... and has the honor to refer to the 
Diplomatic Note from the Department of State of May 22, 2006, 
informing the Embassy of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela 
that the Department found the operation of the Venezuelan 
Military Acquisitions Office (VMAO) in Miami, Florida, to be 
no longer required.  That Note requested that the Venezuelan 
Government take the necessary steps to remove all personnel, 
services, material and equipment related to the VMAO and any 
related facilities. 
 
The Department notes that material and equipment related to 
the VMAO continues to be maintained in warehouse facilities 
in Miami.  The Department requires that the Embassy take all 
necessary steps to remove all such material and equipment 
from the United States within 120 days of receipt of this 
Note. 
 
The Embassy may ship immediately any and all said equipment, 
provided that the proper export documentation under U.S. law 
and regulation has been obtained.  The Unites States 
Government reserves the right to deny the export or transfer 
of any individual item, in accordance with U.S. law and 
regulation. 
 
In the interests of efficiency, the Embassy can provide to 
the Department a bonded inventory of all items retained at 
the VMAO and associated warehouses in order to facilitate the 
process of documenting those items for legal export from the 
United States.  The Department is prepared to assist in this 
process. 
 
The Department informs the Embassy of its intentions to 
definitively close the VMAO and any associated warehouse 
space 120 days after the Embassy's receipt of this Note.
