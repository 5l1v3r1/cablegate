Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U)  As part of an ongoing effort by the BRV to promote 
open-source software (OSS) as a "revolutionary" alternative 
to profit-driven commercial software, the National Assembly 
has proposed a draft Information Technology Law. The 
legislation would require government entitites at all levels 
(plus their contractors and anyone receiving public funds) to 
use OSS.  Currently, most of the BRV uses commercial 
software, whose largest provider in Venezuela is Microsoft. 
IBM is the country's largest provider of OSS.  Deputy Luis 
Tascon, who was hosted by Microsoft in the U.S. earlier this 
year, is fighting the mandatory OSS provisions in the law. 
Felipe Perez, an influential Chavista ex-minister (and owner 
of a Linux distribution company) is one of the main 
proponents of the law.  Fighting between the two factions has 
stalled the drafting of the final version.  End summary.

"Revolutionary" Software 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (U)  The BRV began a trend years ago to favor open-source 
software (OSS) over commercial software.  The rationales for 
the move are the perception that intellectual property rights 
are against the "revolution," that open-source software is 
better for the consumer, and that it would lower costs for 
the BRV.  In 2004, President Chavez issued a decree requiring 
all executive-branch agencies to migrate their operating 
systems to OSS.  However, implementation has been lackluster, 
and often users violate the terms of the software (such as 
making open modifications or using without license). 
Microsoft is the top provider of commercial software 
(Windows) in Venezuela, while IBM is the main provider of OSS 
(Linux). 
 
¶3.  (U)  The Information Technology draft law (Ley de 
Infogobierno) was passed in first discussion in the National 
Assembly on August 2005.  It mandates exclusive use of OSS in 
all government entities (from the executive to municipal 
government), the Central Bank, public universities, companies 
who receive public funds or are directed by a government 
employee (at any level), and companies or persons who provide 
temporary services or goods to the government or to 
government employees.  It also requires migration of existing 
platforms to OSS, establishes criminal sanctions for 
non-compliance, and creates a National Commission for 
Information Technology (CONATI) that would have 
confidentiality agreements with software providers.

Commercial v. Open-Source 
------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U)  In April 2006, the National Assembly established a 
working group, led by Deputy Luis Tascon, to review the draft 
law.  The group was comprised of private sector companies, 
business chambers, labor groups, PDVSA, OSS groups, and 
universities.  Two camps emerged.  One group, under Tascon, 
has pushed to amend the law to allow each government entity 
to choose between OSS and commercial software according to 
their needs.  Tascon recently attended the Global Leadership 
Forum in Washington, DC as a guest of Microsoft, where he met 
Bill Gates. (Comment: It is ironic that Tascon, who is 
infamous for publicly disseminating personal information on 
those who voted against Chavez, would champion licensed 
software.  End Comment). 
 
¶5. (U)  The other group is comprised of proponents of OSS, 
led by Felipe Perez Marti, President of the Venezuelan 
Association of Open-Source Software (and former Minister of 
Planning).  They strongly favor using OSS exclusively, as 
stipulated by the draft law.  Perez, the original drafter of 
 
CARACAS 00001778  002 OF 002 
 
 
the pro-OSS 2004 decree, is the owner of SOLVE (Free Software 
of Venezuela), a Linux distributor, whose board (known as 
"Los Felipillos") is composed of many BRV leaders, reportedly 
including the Minister of Education.  According to Microsoft, 
Perez's company is positioned to provide the BRV with Linux 
and all the technical support.  His company would 
exponentially benefit from mandated government use of OSS, 
which is currently minimal.  IBM's Venezuela operations 
manager noted that they have great relations with the public 
sector (their largest client), but expressed concern that the 
BRV wants to buy the software but not agree to maintenance 
contracts with IBM. 
 
¶6. (U)  During a May 5 working group meeting, Perez publicly 
called Tascon a "traitor."  Tascon expelled him from the room 
and then declared he would finish drafting the law behind 
closed doors due to the "impossibility of consensus" between 
commercial software providers and OSS groups.  The media has 
largely portrayed this as Tascon barring Perez for personal 
reasons.

Conspiracy Theories 
------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU)  Microsoft's General Manager, Gonzalo Fernandez 
(protect), showed EconOff an internal PDVSA memo which 
claimed that all U.S. software companies had a "back door" 
mechanism whereby the U.S. government could at any time 
access information, citing the supposed CALEA Law (United 
States Law of Assistance in Communications for Security 
Systems).  The memo made a claim that the USG simultaneously 
shut down all Microsoft operating systems in Iraq before 
attacking, and then detailed various NSA and CIA hacker 
programs.  The memo concludes that the BRV should not 
contract any services from American providers.

Comment

¶8. (SBU)  If the law passes in current form, the provisions 
for mandatory use of OSS will have grave repercussions for 
BRV operations.  By nature, OSS requires code sharing, and 
could pose security concerns for important BRV institutions, 
such as PDVSA, EDELCA (the electric company), or CADIVI (the 
Foreign Exchange Control Authority).  Though OSS software has 
only a one-time license fee -- and therefore seems more 
cost-effective -- critics claim the system can be less-user 
friendly and requires frequent technical support (which can 
often be costlier than licensing).  According to Microsoft, 
no government in the world has successfully used Linux for 
large operations (Brazil and Cuba reportedly attempted this, 
but then abandoned the effort).  The issue of BRV software 
has become political -- with PQrez trying to bill OSS as a 
"revolutionary" software that would promote endogenous 
development, and Tasc"n siding with commercial software 
providers by promoting "neutrality" in selection of operating 
systems.  Most National Assembly deputies are uninformed on 
the issue and though the law was to be presented in second 
session in early May, there has been no news as of yet.  END 
COMMENT.
