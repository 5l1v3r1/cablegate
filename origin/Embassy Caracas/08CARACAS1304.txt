¶1.  (U) After remaining largely stable since March, 
Venezuela's parallel exchange rate has jumped by more than 40 
percent over the past month, from 3.4 bolivars (Bs) to the 
dollar on August 14, to 4.8 Bs/USD as of September 15.  The 
BRV has been regularly intervening in the parallel market 
since November 2007, attempting to reduce inflationary 
pressures by selling dollar-denominated instruments for 
bolivars in local markets with the aim of lowering monetary 
liquidity and increasing the supply of dollars (ref A). 
However, the BRV has not sold any of these instruments since 
early August, and press reports hinting at possible sales 
have so far had little effect on the rate.  The sudden rise 
in the parallel rate also follows recent BRV actions that 
have likely raised concerns about the future of the 
Venezuelan economy and increased demand for dollars, 
including the issuance of 26 decree laws increasing state 
control of the economy (ref B) and Chavez's September 11 
announcement expelling the US Ambassador (ref C). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: The recent runup in the parallel exchange 
rate probably does not indicate an end to BRV intervention in 
the market, but it could reflect a change in priorities at 
the Ministry of Finance.  Keeping the rate steady for five 
months did not remedy Venezuela's persistent inflation.  The 
BRV has already expended all but about USD 650 million worth 
of the structured debt notes it has been using as one of its 
tools to control the market, and consistent intervention 
could prove increasingly costly in the future.  Nevertheless, 
the BRV is unlikely to ignore the market completely and risk 
allowing the parallel rate to rise to levels similar to those 
seen at the end of last year.  Local analysts think another 
sovereign debt issuance payable in bolivars is possible 
before the end of 2008.  Such an issuance could absorb some 
of the excess liquidity expected from spending in advance of 
the November elections and reign in the parallel rate by 
increasing the supply of dollars.
