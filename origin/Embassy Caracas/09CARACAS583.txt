Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR FRANCISCO FERNANDEZ,
REASONS 1.4 (B) and (D)

¶1. (C) Summary: The international diplomatic community is
quietly questioning the Venezuelan government about the
proposed law restricting international financing of NGOs.
Several European Union (EU) ambassadors are not convinced
that the law will pass, at least not in its most aggressive
form. Nor do they believe that publicly confronting Chavez
on the bill would be a successful strategy to deter it. The
Finnish Ambassador, who has discussed the bill with National
Assembly Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Roy Daza,
suggested to the Charge May 7 that the National Assembly may
not pass the bill, but could use it to intimidate NGOs into
self-censorship. While the National Assembly may be putting
the NGO law on a slower track, the Chavez administration will
ultimately dictate to the National Assembly whatever law it
wants. End Summary.

-------------------------------------
European Ambassadors Speaking Softly
-------------------------------------

¶2. (C) During the May 7 Europe Day celebration in Caracas,
EU member state ambassadors expressed some concern to the
Charge about the proposed law limiting NGO activities (Ref
B), but underscored their reluctance to openly criticize the
Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (GBRV)
(Ref A). The Belgian Ambassador said that he is concerned
about the law and Venezuela's anti-democratic behavior, and
said the EU Mission was taking the lead in opening a dialogue
with the National Assembly members on the negative impact of
the bill if passed. The Spanish Ambassador dismissed the
legislation as being a domestic issue outside of the purview
of the international community. He also emphasized Spain's
commercial and citizen services interests in Venezuela, and
asserted that many Venezuelan NGOs are "political." When
pressed by the Charge, he agreed to further study the law and
said he might be willing to quietly note his interest to the
National Assembly. The Portuguese Ambassador claimed that he
had not yet seen the text of the law, but also said he might
raise it discreetly with the National Assembly.

¶3. (C) The Finnish Ambassador told the Charge that he has
discussed the bill with Roy Daza, Chairman of the National
Assembly's Foreign Relations Committee. The Finnish
Ambassador said he does not think that the National Assembly
considers this bill a high priority and suggested that the
discussion of the law may be only intended to intimidate NGOs
into self-censorship.

¶4. (C) At a May 8 human rights meeting for Caracas-based
diplomats hosted by the Canadian Embassy, the European
Commission representative told NGO representatives that "NGO
laws exist in many countries throughout the world; there is
nothing unique about the Venezuelan draft law". Meanwhile,
Roy Daza gave an interview to the El Universal newspaper on
May 6 emphasizing the importance of the law as a mechanism to
control the activities of NGOs in Venezuela. "Every other
sector of the society is controlled," he said, "why shouldn't
NGOs be controlled too?".

---------------
A Slower Track?
---------------

¶5. (C) Podemos National Assembly Deputy Juan Jose Molina
told Poloffs May 7 that the bill may have been placed on a
slower track. He noted that Foreign Affairs Committee is
parceling out sections of the proposed law from other
legislators to comment. During his recent press interview,
Roy Daza said his committee intends to revise the draft
International Cooperation Law in coordination with other
legislators and after seeking public comment. Molina told
Poloffs that he expected the National Assembly to approve
some version this year that will allow the GBRV to target
specific NGOs that criticize the GBRV.
¶6. (C) Comment. The executive branch, and not Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman Roy Daza, is likely to determine
the final language and timing of passage of the NGO law.
While genuinely concerned about the implications of the NGO
law, EU missions both individually and collectively are
unlikely to confront Chavez publicly on the draft bill. End
Comment.
