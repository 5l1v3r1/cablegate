SUBJECT: "Jesus Christ, Super Censored": GBRV Pressure Sinks 
Musical's Sponsorship Deal 
 
REF: 10 CARACAS 219 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Rolf Olson, Acting Political Counselor, DOS, POL; 
REASON: 1.4(D) 
 
¶1.      (C) Summary: On February 26, local media reported that a 
sponsorship deal for the Venezuelan musical production of Jesus 
Christ, Superstar fell apart after the production company refused 
to comply with demands by sponsors Blackberry-RIM and Movilnet that 
publicity for the musical not be placed in certain local media 
considered unfriendly to the Venezuelan government (GBRV), such as 
TV station Globovision and newspapers El Nacional and El Universal. 
Production company director Michel Hausmann said that the 
state-owned Movilnet and Canadian-based Blackberry-RIM further 
informed him that the producers could place no ads - even with 
their own money - in media which had not been approved by the two 
companies. Hausmann and his fellow producers refused to comply, and 
are seeking other financing. End Summary. 
 
¶2.      (SBU) Local media on February 26 reported that local 
production company Palo de Agua had pulled out of a $300,000 
agreement with two companies, Blackberry-RIM and Movilnet, to 
sponsor and provide publicity for an upcoming local production of 
the musical Jesus Christ, Superstar. (Note: Movilnet is the cell 
phone subsidiary of GBRV-owned telephone company CANTV; 
Blackberry-RIM is a private Canadian company. End Note.) According 
to Palo de Agua's director, Michel Hausmann, the deal had initially 
been consummated verbally on January 7, followed by a January 21 
written confirmation from the two companies. 
 
 
 
¶3.      (SBU) Hausmann relayed that on January 29, Palo de Agua's 
leadership was summoned to a meeting in the Caracas offices of 
Movilnet, where the producers were informed of a "new condition" 
for the contract. Palo de Agua would be barred from placing ads for 
the musical in a handful of specified local media outlets: 
Globovision, radio station Ateneo FM, and local newspapers El 
Nacional, El Universal, El Nuevo Pais, Tal Cual, and Revista Zeta. 
Furthermore, Palo de Agua could not purchase advertising - even 
with its own resources - in media which had not been approved by 
Blackberry RIM and Movilnet. According to Hausmann, an official of 
Movilnet asserted that the musical could only be advertised in the 
newspaper Ultimas Noticias and television channels other than 
Globovision. Finally, the banned media outlets could also not serve 
as co-sponsors of the musical, despite having done so for previous 
Palo de Agua productions. 
 
¶4.      (C) Hausmann told Cultural Officer by phone on February 26 
that Palo de Agua appealed directly to the Mexico-based regional 
headquarters for Blackberry-RIM, which refused to back away from 
Movilnet's demand, arguing it could not go against its "biggest 
ally in the region." Hausmann said Palo de Agua then formally 
pulled out of the deal by affirming that it was "an autonomous 
business that did not mix its artistic objectives with ideologies 
that run contrary to principles of liberty and democracy." Fellow 
Palo de Agua director Yair Rosemberg observed that "it's one thing 
when the government acts this way, to which we are well-accustomed. 
But Blackberry-RIM is a business that has many interests outside of 
Venezuela." Hausmann also relayed to Cultural Officer that Palo de 
Agua had wanted to go public about the dispute when it transpired 
in late January, but feared retaliation before the production work 
had commenced. Hausmann said his fears were confirmed when in the 
first hour after the news broke on February 26, Palo de Agua's 
agent received a call from Movilnet asserting that Palo de Agua 
"would regret the decision" to go public, and should be prepared to 
"get screwed." 
 
¶5.      (C) Comment: The GBRV's policy of withdrawing advertising 
from private media outlets it perceives to be "attacking the 
revolution" has already taken a significant toll on the financial 
prospects of many of those outlets (Reftel). This incident confirms 
the degree to which the GBRV seeks to shut off any source of 
revenue to media it considers politically antagonistic. End 
Comment.
