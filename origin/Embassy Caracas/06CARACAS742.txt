Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU)  On March 19, the closed bridge linking Caracas and 
its international air and sea ports collapsed.  Chavez and 
the Ministry of Infrastructure (MINFRA) both stated that the 
BRV had knowledge of the imminent collapse and were planning 
to demolish the bridge, but that they didn't release this 
information due to "fear of rumors."  The narrow bypass road, 
opened on February 26, has absorbed most of the traffic flow 
and has reduced travel time to the airport over three-fold. 
However, significant delays are still reported during rush 
hours and steep pitching on the sides of the road could pose 
mudslide risk when the rainy season begins in a few weeks. 
The coastal state of Vargas is showing signs of recovery as 
tourists return.  Post lifted travel restrictions on March 8, 
ending armored shuttle service and allowing Embassy personnel 
to use personal vehicles to travel the bypass road.  End 
Summary.

Bridge collapses, BRV reaction 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) On the morning of Sunday, March 19, the 
structurally-damaged bridge linking Caracas and La Guaira 
collapsed, leaving mounds of debris and a dramatic photo 
opportunity (Note: to see images of the collapse visit 
www.eluniversal.com/2006/03/19/pol fot 19A684759.shtml. End 
Note.)  The Vice-Minister for Infrastructure appeared shortly 
on the scene, declaring that the BRV had made plans over the 
last week to demolish the structure, but had not publicly 
announced it in order to "avoid rumors."  A day earlier, a 
MINFRA spokesperson had said that the bridge was not in "a 
grave situation" (read: imminent danger of collapse). 
President Chavez, in his March 19 "Alo Presidente," "thanked 
the bridge" for its 50-plus years of service, and took the 
opportunity to attack Globovision, an opposition-leaning news 
channel, for attempting to criticize the government's 
handling of the bridge crisis and infrastructure issues in 
general. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Traffic flow back to normal, kind of 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (U)  Since the opening of the two-lane, 2.5 km bypass road 
on February 26 (Ref A), the average time to get to the 
airport from Caracas has decreased considerably (from 3-5 hrs 
average to one hour or less).  However, there are still some 
delays along the way.  During rush hours or when cargo 
traffic is heavy, the wait to get on the bypass road 
increases considerably (up to 3 hrs in some instances), and 
the National Guard has periodically cut off traffic to allow 
both lanes to move in one direction in order to clear out 
backlogs.  The road is in good condition, but steep pitching 
on either side poses a significant mudslide threat.  MINFRA 
is installing netting and barriers along the road in an 
effort to mitigate this risk. 
 
¶4. (U)  The road, while greatly alleviating the traffic flow 
problems caused by use of the "Old Highway," cannot fully 
replace the pre-closure capacity.  Due to delays, many 
travelers still choose the "Old Highway," despite removal of 
National Guard presence and safety concerns.  The state of 
Vargas is showing signs of recuperation and weekend beaches 
are again filled with tourists. 
 
----------------------- 
Post lifts restrictions 
----------------------- 
 
¶5. (U)  In view of the bridge bypass road opening, Post 
 
CARACAS 00000742  002 OF 002 
 
 
lifted travel restrictions for Embassy personnel on March 8, 
suspending armored shuttle service indefinitely.  Embassy 
personnel are free to use their personal vehicles or other 
transport on the bridge bypass road and on the Galipan-Avila 
route (on 4x4 vehicles only).  The "Old Highway" is 
off-limits for personnel at all times, due to safety 
concerns.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  The collapse of the fractured bridge was 
predictable and expected, given the unstable geology of the 
area.  The BRV's statements that the bridge was going to be 
demolished are dubious, since neither the Ministry of 
Infrastructure nor anyone else in the BRV had announced that 
previously.  The excuse of "avoiding rumors" masks the 
irresponsibility of withholding information on the obvious 
safety risks of the collapse.  The BRV was lucky that nobody 
was under the bridge when it fell.  The bridge collapse is a 
powerful image that some media outlets tried to use to 
exemplify Chavez' poor record on infrastructure.  However, it 
has not had visible political implications for Chavez so far.
