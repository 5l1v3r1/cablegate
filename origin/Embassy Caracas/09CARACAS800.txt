¶2.  (SBU)  On June 25, official Venezuelan news agency ABN 
announced the number of confirmed H1N1 cases had risen to one 
hundred and eighty, with an unknown number of additional 
suspected cases undergoing analysis.  Of the confirmed cases, 
all patients, according to ABN, are exhibiting mild symptoms 
and receiving the appropriate treatment without 
hospitalization.  Upon confirmation of a case of H1N1, the 
Venezuelan government has taken adequate and appropriate 
measures to isolate the patient and identify contacts.  ABN 
stated that fifty four of the confirmed cases were contracted 
abroad while the remainder of cases were contracted through 
close contact with infected individuals.
