¶1. (U) SUMMARY: The BRV,s National Development Fund (FONDEN) 
published a financial statement for the first time since its 
inception 11 months ago. Coupled with a recent presentation 
by Finance Minister Merentes, the documents show that Fonden 
has received USD 14.9 billion in combined Central Bank and 
PDVSA transfers during that period, and has disbursed 41 
percent of the total for projects in the transportation, 
energy, basic industries, health care, agriculture, 
financial, defense and housing sectors as of July 7.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) According to a July 7 presentation by Finance Minister 
Merentes, since its inception in July 2005, Fonden has 
received a total of USD 14.9 billion.  This amount includes 
USD 10.3 billion from the Central Bank (BCV) and USD 4.6 
billion from PDVSA (see reftels A and B).  According to the 
presentation, Fonden had spent USD 6.1 billion, or 41 percent 
of this amount. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The presentation showed that Fonden to date had 
disbursed USD 6.1 billion across 42 projects in the following 
sectors: infrastructure (USD 796 million), energy and 
petroleum (USD 423 million), basic industry and mining (USD 
176 million), health (USD 447 million), agriculture and land 
(USD 364 million), environment (USD 12 million), finance (USD 
3.5 billion, of which the majority presumably went toward the 
purchase of Argentinedebt), defense (USD 77 million) and 
housing (USD 91 million).  The total number of projects 
envisoned to receive Fonden support is 85.  Current 
frecasts are for a total of USD 10.7 billion to be isbursed 
from Fonden across all projects with th initial 42 having 
already received Fonden disbursements.  Details regarding 
specific projects were not included in the presentation. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Spending by Fonden has increased in fits and starts 
with the largest increase occurring in the March and April, 
2006 time frame with disbursements totaling USD 4.4 billion. 
At the end of June 2006 spending was running at between USD 
200 and 500 milion monthly.  (NOTE: The BCV is holding 
approximtely USD 34 billion in foreign reserves.  Given tht 
BRV officials have previously said that the accptable 
reserve level is in the USD 25 ) 28 billin range, it seems 
likely that they will raid theBCV again in the future. END 
NOTE.) 
 
¶5. (U) Th board of directors of Fonden published a statement 
in the tabloid daily, Ultimas Noticias8 on August 23 which 
contained asnapshot of Fonden,s balance sheet as of June 
30  This was the first official publication from Fondn and 
listed approximately USD 8.8 billion in curent assets, 
allocated between projects in execuion (USD 5.4 billion) and 
unallocated funds for rojects (USD 3.2 billion).  The fund 
had approxiately USD 200 million in reserves and equity. 
 
6.(SBU) The USD 8.8 billion in total assets does not include 
money already disbursed, apparently including the 
approximately USD 3 billion spent on Argentine bonds.  These 
dollar-denominated assets were sold to banks and companies in 
Venezuela (see reftel C) for local currency.  However, it is 
unclear what happened to the proceeds from their sale.  At 
the time of the transaction, the BRV defended the action as a 
means to combat inflation (reftel C); however, if the 
proceeds from their sale had re-entered the Venezuelan 
economy as Bolivars, Fonden would be creating money.  Such an 
action would increase the money supply and drive inflationary 
pressures. 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT: The publication of this information 
demonstrates an interesting (if marginal) increase in 
transparency on behalf of the BRV regarding Fonden and may 
have been a response to criticism regarding Fonden's 
transparency.  The balance sheet cannot be found on either 
Fonden or the Ministry of Finance websites and was not 
reported by any media outlet.  END COMMENT.
