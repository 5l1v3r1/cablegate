SUBJECT: BROAD OPPOSITION FORMS AGAINST "ANTI-ISLAMIZATION CONGRESS" 
IN COLOGNE 
 
REF: 07 DUESSELDORF  22 (JUNE 26, 2007 "TALE OF TWO MOSQUES") 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary: Plans by the anti-immigrant, far right group 
"Pro Koeln" to hold a so-called "Anti-Islamization Congress" on 
September 19-20 in Cologne have provoked broad opposition from 
all major political parties, trade unions, and churches, as well 
as radical leftist and anarchist groups.  Organizers expect 
about 1,000 participants from Germany and other European 
countries at the event, while Cologne police plan for as many as 
40,000 counter demonstrators and have taken major security 
measures in view of potential violence.  Mission Germany issued 
a Warden Message on September 17.  End Summary. 
 
Gathering of Anti-Immigrant Groups 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) "Pro Koeln," a local anti-immigrant, far right group 
which gained 4.7 percent of the popular vote in the 2004 
municipal elections, made national headlines by attempting to 
prevent the construction of Germany's largest mosque in the city 
(Reftel).  The plan was approved by the Cologne City Council on 
August 28.  In response, "Pro Koeln" has gone ahead with plans 
for an "Anti-Islamization Congress," which includes a September 
20 public rally under the slogan "No to Islamization - No to 
Cologne's Mega Mosque."  In its announcement, "Pro Koeln" listed 
keynote speakers from abroad, including Jean Marie Le Pen (Front 
National, France), Hans-Christian Strache (FPO, Austria), Filip 
Dewinter (Vlaams Belang, Belgium), and Mario Borghezio (Lega 
Nord, and MEP from Italy).  Le Pen's office, however, has 
reportedly denied he has accepted the invitation, and Strache 
canceled his participation, promising to send a video message. 
A Bundestag backbencher, Henry Nitzsche from Saxony 
(independent, formerly CDU), is also scheduled to speak at the 
rally. 
 
Broad Coalition Builds Against Congress 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3.  (U) Over the past several weeks, a broad alliance has been 
formed at the local and state level to oppose the event. 
Several counter demonstrations with an estimated participation 
of as many as 40,000 people have been scheduled before and 
during a "Pro Koeln" rally on September 20.  The main counter 
demonstration will take place in front of the Cologne Cathedral 
with Cologne Lord Mayor Fritz Schramma (CDU) as the main 
speaker.  Schramma has called on the citizens of Cologne to show 
their opposition to the "Pro Koeln" event with non-violent, 
peaceful means, reflecting concerns by police that leftist and 
anarchist "autonomous" groups might be posed to engage in 
violent clashes with rightwing followers and the police. 
 
¶4.  (U) On September 15, Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee 
Chairman Ruprecht Polenz, who also chairs the "Christian-Muslim 
Peace Initiative," together with Schramma and leading 
representatives of the "Turkish-Islamic Union" (DITIB), kicked 
off a poster campaign in Cologne under the slogan "Dialogue and 
Tolerance instead of Aggression and Fear."  A resolution 
entitled "Against Racism and Xenophobia - For Diversity and 
Tolerance" was introduced by all four parties in North 
Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) legislature on 9/11 and is likely to be 
unanimously adopted on September 18.  The resolution expresses 
concern about the "Anti-Islamization Congress," stating that it 
runs counter to the "joint efforts of all political parties in 
the NRW Landtag to intensify intercultural and inter-religious 
dialogue."  Minister-President Juergen Ruettgers (CDU) also 
warned against the event, stressing that he and his party are 
'opposed to any form of extremism, either from the right or 
left" and that the CDU must prevent the establishment of a 
political force to its right. 
 
Warden Message Issued 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) In view of police concerns over the potential for 
violence, Mission Germany on September 17 issued a Warden 
Message advising American citizens to defer non-essential travel 
to Cologne on September 19 and 20, and encouraging American 
citizens in the Cologne area to avoid areas of demonstrations, 
if possible. 
 
¶6.  (U) This cable was coordinated with Embassy Berlin and 
Consulate General Frankfurt.
