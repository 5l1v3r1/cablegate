SUBJECT: NATIONAL MUSLIM GROUP SPOKESMAN WELCOMES GERMAN GOVERNMENT'S 
POST RAMADAN DINNER 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified -- Not for Internet Distribution 
 
¶1.  (U) In an October 16 conversation with Duesseldorf Pol/Econ 
Officer, Bekir Alboga, the new spokesperson for the Muslim 
Coordination Council (KRM) commented positively on a dinner he 
attended in Berlin the day before hosted by Federal Interior 
Minister Schaeuble, to celebrate the end of Ramadan. 
Representatives from all four umbrella organizations (DITIB, 
ZMD, VIKZ and Islamrat) were present, as well as select other 
Muslim leaders.  Chancellor Merkel was a surprise guest who, 
according to Alboga, was very inquisitive and engaged.  To our 
knowledge, news of this event has not appeared in the German 
media. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Alboga was elated and touched by the gesture and 
remarked that this was the first time that the German government 
has held a Ramadan-related event at such a high level.  He 
noted, however, that "the German government has not been as fast 
as the US Embassy" in engaging Muslims around Ramadan.  Or, as 
another national Muslim leader said, "so far it has been 
unimaginable for us to be received at President Koehler's 
official residence in Berlin, as American Muslims have been at 
the White House -- for the last seven years!"  Alboga added that 
Koehler congratulated Muslims on Ramadan privately, via letter, 
this year but not officially, as for example via a press 
release.  He expressed satisfaction at this step, but would have 
liked to see the German government celebrate Ramadan more 
publicly. 
 
¶3.  (U) Briefly outlining his strategic plan for the next six 
months he will be spokesman (the position rotates between the 
four KRM constituent groups), Alboga said his main objective is 
to create KRM-like structures at the state level throughout 
Germany in order to fulfill the organizational prerequisites to 
offer Islamic religious instruction in public schools (modeled 
after Christian religious instruction).  In this connection, 
Alboga commented on the fact that in the state of North 
Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) the Alevites (a liberal Muslim group) 
already have this possibility, saying, "if the Alleviates have 
this right, it's high time we (i.e. the Muslim groups organized 
in the KRM) have it too." 
 
Comment 
----------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Alboga's observations were the latest we have heard 
from senior Muslims in NRW who have commented favorably, 
privately and publicly, on the USG approach to hosting Iftars -- 
at the White House, by Embassies, and by Consulates like ours. 
While the NRW government has begun to host these events (doing 
so for the second consecutive year in September), a number of 
contacts have noted the comparative lack of engagement around 
Ramadan at the Federal level.  We have no indication that the 
example set by Mission Germany directly influenced Interior 
Minister Schaeuble to host this dinner, but the implicit 
comparison with the USG appears to be widely understood in 
Muslim communities in Germany and reflects favorably on Mission 
activities.  This may presage greater German engagement in 
Ramadan 2008.  End Comment. 
 
¶5.  (U) This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin.
