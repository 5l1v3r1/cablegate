Ethics and diplomacy 
 
 
 
Editorial: "After hosting the Presidents of Israel and of the 
Palestinian Authority, President Lula...said that an agreement in 
the Middle East will not be reached without this or that player 
being isolated...however, the desired inclusion of countries  [in 
the peace dialogue] cannot serve as the foundation of diplomacy 
without ethics... Brazil's help must be directed so that Iran 
accepts the U.S. proposal and so that it proves the allegedly 
peaceful nature of its nuclear program, opening it to international 
inspections. Lula preferred [to make] innocuous statements [during 
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's visit to Brazil], in favor 
of 'Iran's right to a peaceful nuclear program.' This is not 
enough.... Courting an Ahmadinejad who has been kept in power by a 
military coup will not be helpful...in terms of promoting Lula's 
image abroad... it is symptomatic that the Iranian leader left 
Brasilia to go to Bolivia and Venezuela... More power 
internationally means more responsibilities. It is a severe mistake 
to face these responsibilities with a diplomacy in which the ends 
justify the means." (Center-right, Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper, 
O Globo, 11/25).
