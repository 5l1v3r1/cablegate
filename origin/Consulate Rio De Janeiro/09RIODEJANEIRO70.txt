SUBJECT: O GLOBO NEWSPAPER, "A Fresh Start" on U.S.-Russian 
Relations 
 
Center-right O Globo commented on page 06 (03/31/2009): "The fact 
that Start 1, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, signed in 1991, 
will expire in December gives practical meaning to the first meeting 
between Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitri Medvedev, which will take 
place tomorrow in London.  The apparent interest that they both 
have...to further reduce their nuclear arsenal could pave the way 
for the review of a shaken bilateral relationship. 
 
...both countries need one another.  The time when Russia could do 
without Western investors and rest solely on its oil and gas exports 
is long gone.  These are times of crisis and the price of oil has 
tumbled, reducing the Kremlin's bargaining power and putting at 
stake the hegemony of the dominant political group-read Vladimir 
Putin and his entourage. 
 
The United States needs Russian influence to obtain more flexibility 
from Iran when it comes to the Iranian nuclear program...  Moscow 
can spur Iran to contribute to the stabilization of Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and also make them contributors to the peace process in 
Israel, Palestine and Syria. 
 
President Obama has replaced the less than friendly approach of 
George W. Bush with an openness for a fresh start with the Kremlin, 
which still resents U.S. policy to attract former Soviet Republics 
like Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO...  When these two young 
presidents meet, empathy might favor the discussion of burdensome 
topics.  Advancing negotiations to reduce nuclear weapons... will be 
a promising new beginning.
