Rio-based center-left daily Jornal do Brasil writes: "(...) During 
the American Presidential campaign in 2008, when he rose as a 
phenomenon, for the new air that he would bring to American and 
international politics, Obama assured that his administration would 
be marked by (..)more diplomacy and less isolation and belligerence 
in its relations with other countries. All of this very different 
from the style of his predecessor, George W. Bush, who activated a 
U.S. war machine spreading anti-Americanism throughout the world 
that hadn't been seen for a long time. Obama won, took office, and 
now, after three months studying the best strategy for the 
situation in Afghanistan, decided not to bring back the soldiers, 
but to send more troops. The measure may seem incoherent and 
unpopular: for contradicting his campaign (...)as well as for the 
fact that he received the Nobel Peace Prize. But there is nothing 
contradictory. In the first place, the award given to Obama in 
October by the Swedish Academy took into consideration much more of 
what the American President could do than what he had already done 
in promoting peace. (...)In the end, Obama's decision is not 
unjustified. There have been many mistakes made in administering 
the war in Afghanistan and it is necessary to fix them. It serves 
no one to withdraw, leaving a country unstructured, with fragile 
institutions and a fragile government, vulnerable to the Taliban 
and al-Qaeda barbarities. In this case, more battles can save many 
lives--and lead to peace."  (Dec 3, page A8)
