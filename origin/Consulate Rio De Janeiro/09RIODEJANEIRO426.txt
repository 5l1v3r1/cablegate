Rio-based center-right daily O Globo writes: "...the planet is 
hotter due to man's activities. (...) There will be consequences to 
civilization if the current Climate Summit (COP-15) in Copenhagen 
does not begin to find antidotes against [global warming] (...). 
The less pollutant emissions, the better. The issue involves a 
furious political and ideological battle (...) Credible 
institutions are disclosing new evidence. The World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO) announced that this decade will be the hottest 
since they started to keep track 150 years ago. (...) On the other 
hand, promising decisions are arising from countries, with the 
weight of the U.S., that now considers the six main gases in 
greenhouse emissions to be harmful to human health. The measure, 
announced by President Barack Obama at the Summit's opening, paves 
the way for the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to 
regulate, already in 2010, emissions from vehicles, industry and 
energy plants without depending on the [Climate Change] legislation 
still stuck in Congress. The American decision gave a powerful 
impulse to negotiations that appeared very difficult in Copenhagen. 
It is not only about rich countries investing billions to cut their 
emissions, but also granting generous financing so that poor 
nations can do the same. There is no other way"  (Dec 9, page 6).
