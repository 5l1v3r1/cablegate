Intervention 
 
The U.S. bases and intervention 
 
 
 
Rio-based center-left daily Jornal do Brasil writes: "The 
revelation made by JB regarding the doubts about the real use of 
the bases... [by the U.S. in Colombia] sheds light on an old 
discussion. Ultimately, what differentiates an installation for 
observation versus a platform for intervention? ... Specialists 
cited in the story uncover the veil that the ambiguity tries to 
hide: without a clear point of reference, the argument for 'right 
to self defense' could justify... a military operation in 
neighboring territories. The theory of 'preventive wars' is not 
new, it's been used in the Middle East for ages and the U.S. has 
also used it in the two interventions in Iraq. The subtle 
difference in the type of agreement negotiated between Washington 
and Bogota justifies in part the belligerent speech of Venezuelan 
President Hugo Ch????vez regarding the issue... Before the signing of 
this agreement with President ????lvaro Uribe, the U.S. kept its 
presence in the heart of South America operating from the base of 
Manta... Officially, the base was used by the Americans to look for 
arms and drug traffickers trying to infiltrate the country through 
the Gulf of Mexico. But nothing would have kept it from being used 
for logistical and operational support to the helicopters and jets 
that decimated a FARC camp 13km from the country's border... The 
American bases in Colombia are the American stage from which to act 
in the so-called 'critical sub-region,' the South America 
threatened by drugs, misery, terrorism, anti-Americanism and the 
recurrence of natural disasters. Even with the government's 
guarantees of a non-interventionist presence, it is hard to believe 
entirely in these intentions in light of the official document 
cited by the newspaper. After all, unconventional threats are the 
main worries of the strategists."  (Nov 22, page A8)
