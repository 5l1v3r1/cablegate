¶1. (U) Summary.  A Brazilian oil company that has yet to drill a 
single well raised US$4.16 billion in an initial stock offering in 
mid-June, Brazil's largest public offering to date.  The huge 
success of the IPO for OGX Petroleo e Gas Participoes SA reflects a 
tide of optimism generated by the recent, potentially huge discovery 
of pre-salt oil reserves in Brazil's Santos Basin.  Domestic oil 
giant Petrobras views OGX's success as a direct threat.  Further 
friction between the two companies is likely as they compete for 
exploration opportunities and production resources.  End Summary. 
 
OGX ENTERS THE OIL GAME, TARGETS PETROBRAS 
 
¶2. (U) Rio de Janeiro-based oil company OGX was created less than a 
year ago, but it is already creating quite a buzz in the industry 
for its bold moves in challenging Brazilian oil giant Petrobras for 
a share of the market.  OGX is run by 51-year old Brazilian 
entrepreneur Eike Batista.  Though Batista has little knowledge of 
the oil business, he is an incredibly successful entrepreneur and 
investors are betting that he will find success in the oil game as 
well.  In mid-June, OGX raised US$4.16 billion in an initial public 
offering (IPO), Brazil's largest IPO to date (REF E). 
 
¶3. (U) In putting together his OGX team last year, Batista targeted 
the "best of the best" and spared no expense.  He hired Francisco 
Gros, former Petrobras President under the Cardoso administration, 
to be CEO.  He lured more key executives away from their positions 
at Petrobras in exchange for equity in Batista's companies, making 
them instant millionaires. 
 
¶4. (U) In October 2007, just one month before Brazil's "Ninth Bid 
Round" lease sale for new offshore exploration blocks, OGX delivered 
an especially damaging blow to Petrobras' interests.  Petrobras' 
Manager for Exploration and Production Paulo Mendonca and Contracts 
Manager Luis Reis defected to OGX, bringing with them intimate 
knowledge of Petrobras' bidding strategy in the upcoming auction 
such as which blocks Petrobras wanted and how much it was willing to 
bid. 
 
¶5. (U) OGX performed remarkably at the Bid Round, attracting 
attention for routinely out-bidding Petrobras.  It paid around 
US$800 million for exploration rights in high-potential blocks with 
estimated reserves of 4.8 billion barrels.  For the most part, OGX's 
blocks are located in shallow offshore locations that already have 
been produced and returned to the government.  However, these blocks 
may prove valuable given the price of oil and industry speculation 
that decent reserves remain in them.  Indeed, these were blocks that 
Petrobras had already identified for itself using a wealth of 
geological data research.  OGX plans to start drilling wells by the 
end of 2008 and hopes to announce oil discoveries as soon as 2009 
with some production activity about two years later, announced 
company executives in late-June. 
 
¶6. (U) OGX also has its eyes on Brazil's newly discovered pre-salt 
reserves, as does the rest of the industry (REFS A and B).  It was 
prepared to bid strongly on pre-salt blocks in the Ninth Bid Round, 
but those blocks were withdrawn by the government prior to the 
auction (REF C).  In recent press statements, company executives 
have said that they have already earmarked US $1.1 billion to 
acquire new pre-salt exploration prospects if they are offered later 
this year. 
 
EIKE BATISTA'S PURSUIT OF WEALTH 
 
¶7. (U) OGX's success in entering the domestic oil market is due, in 
large part, to the outstanding business record of owner Eike 
Batista.  He is currently the richest man in Brazil with investments 
in mining, power, oil, real estate, logistics, entertainment and 
forestry valued at roughly US$17 billion.  Aside from his recent 
success with the OGX IPO, Batista netted US$3.5 billion in April 
with the sale of mines to Anglo American -- his third ten-figure 
payoff in two years from companies he built.  He stands to gain at 
least US$1 billion more in a planned offering of his logistics 
business, LLX Logistica SA.  He sees tremendous opportunity in 
Brazil's oil sector.  In a January 2008 press interview, Batista 
boldly claimed that he wanted to surpass Bill Gates in wealth within 
five years. 
 
 
RIO DE JAN 00000159  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶8. (U) Batista's road to wealth has been remarkable.  In 2001, he 
lost almost his entire fortune, acquired through lucrative gold 
mining ventures in Brazil, when he unsuccessfully gambled on mining 
interests in Europe and Russia.  In one case, a Greek court annulled 
his mining permits which resulted in a US$330 million loss.  Over 
the following six years, Batista refocused on South America and 
quickly found success in the iron ore industry.  By 2007, Fortune 
Magazine valued him at US$6.6 billion and ranked him number 142 on 
its List of World Billionaires.  In the past year, he has nearly 
tripled his wealth. 
 
COMMENT 
 
¶9. (SBU) OGX's dramatic entry into the Brazilian oil industry is 
significant.  With the financial backing of Batista, OGX has built a 
formidable team.  U.S. oil company contacts have privately shared 
how they are reveling in Petrobras' frustration with having to deal 
with real competition from a domestic company for the first time. 
Worth watching is Petrobras' further reaction as OGX gears up to 
drill wells.  Though OGX can hire top people and win exploration 
blocks with money alone, it will need partners to drill for and 
produce oil.  We are hearing that Petrobras is strongly discouraging 
(i.e. threatening to cut them off from Petrobras projects) its own 
partners from working with OGX.  It remains to be seen if OGX can 
successfully convince potential partners to stand up to Petrobras.
