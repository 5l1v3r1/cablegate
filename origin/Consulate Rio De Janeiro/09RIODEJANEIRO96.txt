Article Title: Obama's Gestures 
 
Rio-based center-right O Globo commented on page 06 of its April 21 
issue: "one of the most noteworthy results from the Summit of the 
Americas ... was the fact that Barack Obama overshadowed the 
melodramatic Hugo Chvez. Obama was able to...offer a message of 
reconciliation in a cordial environment.  For example when he 
praised the work of Cuban doctors in other countries and said that 
the U.S. should follow the example and send more than weapons to the 
region and to the rest of the world. And then when he saluted Evo 
Morales for being the first indigenous leader of a country with an 
indigenous majority. 
 
Chvez ordered his partners at the Bolivarian Alternative for the 
Americas (ALBA) - Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Honduras, 
Dominica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines - not to sign the 
final declaration of the summit. However, this gesture was 
irrelevant compared to Obama's statement that U.S. rivals in the 
region are not threats to American interests, and his promise to 
respect elected governments, regardless of ideological differences. 
The U.S. President's stance, open to dialogue, exhausted 
"Bolivarianism," which no longer has the "demon" characterized by 
George Bush, to exorcize. 
 
Some Latin American leaders resorted to the ballad of accusing the 
U.S. for the problems of the continent, always in search of an 
outside guilty party for its problems. In those cases, President 
Lula's mediating behavior stood out, as seconded by Michele Bachelet 
(Chile) and Felipe Caldersn (Mexico), who preferred not to emphasize 
the past, but to open possibilities for the future. This position 
was in tune with the message brought by Obama to Trinidad and 
Tobago. Brazil performed well, as it simply cannot take part in 
Chavist deliriums or engage in old-fashioned speeches against 
"imperialism," which only serve to uncover old inefficiencies of 
governments on the continent. 
 
For his internal audience, Fidel Castro dismissed, characterizing as 
"charity," Obama's initiatives to reduce restrictions to travel and 
money transfers to Cuba. However, President Ral said he was willing 
to talk to the U.S.  "about everything." If, in a historic gesture, 
he does so, he will certainly not want to have Chvez around.  Then 
the caudillo will have to reinvent himself."
