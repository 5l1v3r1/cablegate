Chavist Blackout 
 
 
 
Editorial: "There is increasingly more evidence that the 
belligerent tone of Hugo Chavez towards Colombia has more to do 
with his [personal] reasons than the ceding to the U.S. of seven 
bases in Colombian territory by the Uribe Administration. Chavez 
resorts to an external threat to downplay problems which have been 
corroding  the lasting popularity of the caudillo... Eight out of 
ten Venezuelans rebuff the possibility of a military conflict with 
Colombia, showing that Chavez's appeal to nationalism does not seem 
to be working... In order to keep the nationalistic flame 
lit,...the Bolivarian leader rejected Brazil's proposal to 
establish a Venezuela-Colombia system to patrol the common border 
of 2,000 kilometers...This is the divisive and belligerent Chavez 
who wants a place for Venezuela in Mercosul. To Get it, he depends 
only on the approval of the Brazilian and Paraguayan Senates. The 
Paraguayan Foreign Minister, Hector Laconagta, summed it up: ' 
Chavez has a confrontational was of speaking, creating a climate 
which is not very appropriate for regional integration.' Brazilian 
senators must think about this." (Center-right, Rio de 
Janeiro-based newspaper, O Globo, 11/18).
