SUBJECT: BRAZIL OIL & GAS - BID ROUND 10 
 
REF: Rio de Janeiro 235 
 
¶1.  Summary.  On December 18, 2008, Brazil held its 10th Bid Round 
to license oil and gas exploration rights.  Unlike past auctions, 
Bid Round 10 only offered onshore blocks (offshore opportunities are 
on hold until the government decides how it wants to handle the 
"pre-salt" region).  Results of the auction were modest with only 54 
of the 130 offered blocks being sold.  As expected, Petrobras 
performed well, winning 27 of the 28 blocks on which it bid.  A 
number of small to medium sized Brazilian firms also picked up 
several blocks.  Five U.S. firms registered for the auction, 
including one company which is not yet active in Brazil, but none of 
them submitted any bids.  In total, the auction raised approximately 
USD 39 million in signing bonuses (in addition to a set percentage 
of future production, if any).  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  Bid Round 10 is significant because it is the first such auction 
in Brazil since November 2007, when the government suspended all oil 
and gas licensing after the discovery of potentially massive 
reserves in the ultra-deepwater "pre-salt" area off of Brazil's 
southeastern coast.  Unlike previous bid rounds, held since 1999 and 
always with a major offer in offshore areas, Bid Round 10 
exclusively offered onshore blocks.  On one hand, that any auction 
took place is good news as it signals the government's interest in 
maintaining a transparent, competitive licensing regime which is 
open to foreign companies.  On the other hand, the current offering 
of only onshore blocks means that companies may have to wait years 
before attractive offshore blocks, including pre-salt, are 
auctioned.  Brazil currently produces only around 11 percent of its 
oil and 35 percent of its natural gas onshore. 
 
¶4.  Highlights of the auction's results follows below: 
 
Number of Blocks Offered - 130 
 
Number of Blocks Purchased - 54 
 
Number of Blocks Not Receiving Any Bids - 76 
 
Total Signing Bonuses Raised - USD 38,872,576 
 
Total Minimum Exploratory Program (PME) Work Units Committed - 
128,707 
 
¶5.  Forty-three companies, mostly Brazilian, registered for the 
auction.  Five U.S. firms registered but ultimately did not submit 
any bids: Anardarko, Devon, Exxon, Hess, and Laco (Note: Laco does 
not currently operate in Brazil).  Chevron and El Paso, which also 
operate in Brazil, did not participate in the auction.  The only 
foreign firms which purchased oil and gas rights in Bid Round 10 are 
Petrogal (Portugal), Shell (United Kingdom), STR (Argentina), and 
Synergy (Panama). 
 
¶6.  Meanwhile, the petroleum workers union has been staging several 
protests against the auction in Rio de Janeiro, claiming that such 
auctions allow foreigners to take Brazil's rightful oil wealth and 
that Petrobras should revert to being the national oil company.  In 
addition to demonstrations at Petrobras and the oil regulatory 
agency, union workers mounted a banner on Rio's famed Sugarloaf 
Mountain which read "The Oil Is Ours".
