¶1.  Summary.  Mid-sized banks in Brazil are experiencing liquidity 
problems since the onset of the global financial crisis, BBM Bank 
CEO Pedro Mariani Bittencourt told Amb. Sobel on October 20. 
Bittencourt predicted further global market volatility over the next 
few months, which will continue to affect the banking sector in 
Brazil.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  On October 20, Ambassador Sobel met with Pedro Henrique Mariani 
Bittencourt, President and CEO of Rio de Janeiro-based BBM Bank. 
BBM is Brazil's oldest private-sector bank and one of Brazil's 
leading mid-sized financial institutions.  Mid-sized Brazilian banks 
play a significant role in making credit, especially structured 
credit, available to smaller and mid-sized companies who often 
cannot obtain such funding from larger banks or the capital markets. 
 As such, BBM and other mid-sized banks play an important role in 
making additional credit resources available to Brazil's 
increasingly vibrant middle-market corporate sector. 
 
¶3.  Bittencourt said that most mid-sized banks in Brazil have been 
experiencing liquidity problems as a result of the global financial 
crisis.  Corporations needing money have begun to exercise the put 
option, he said.  Liquidity problems were alleviated in the second 
and third week of the crisis as money began coming in from the big 
banks and the public banks to the mid-sized banks.  However, he 
said, this money will not be enough to solve the problem. 
Bittencourt predicted that the Brazilian banking sector will 
continue to be affected by further global market volatility over the 
next few months and identified key issues for the industry to 
consider, such as how to roll over debt and how to discount new 
loans. 
 
¶4.  Ambassador Sobel and Bittencourt also discussed the implications 
on the banking sector from the drop in consumer confidence. 
Bittencourt indicated that 10 percent of the finance in Brazil comes 
from trade finance, which will suffer when people do not want to 
spend money.  The loss of confidence by consumers is becoming more 
evident by the fact that companies and the general public are moving 
to have their deposits on demand because of fears of a crash. 
 
¶5.  This message was cleared/coordinated with Embassy Brasilia.
