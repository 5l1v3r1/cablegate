¶1. Summary.  A shortage of drilling rigs and looming relinquishment 
deadlines have made Brazilian oil company Petrobras delay tests on 
potentially huge subsalt finds like Carioca and move the rigs to 
other blocks.  Petrobras CEO Sergio Gabrielli announced in late May 
that production evaluation tests would have to wait and expected no 
additional information on the Carioca reserve any time soon. 
Meanwhile, Petrobras is launching a major program to contract the 
construction of deep sea drilling equipment in anticipation of 
further exploration and production of subsalt areas.  End Summary. 
¶2.  In late May, Petrobras CEO Sergio Gabrielli announced that the 
company had ceased doing tests on potentially huge subsalt finds 
such as the Carioca field in the Santos Basin (Ref A) in order to 
fulfill other exploration requirements and avoid having to 
relinquish areas.  Under Brazilian regulations, if no oil is found 
in blocks under concessions by a certain deadline, operators have to 
return parts and then, eventually, the whole of the area to the 
government.  By the end of 2010, Petrobras has to present the 
National Petroleum Agency (ANP) with a complete evaluation and 
production plan for all the pre-salt blocks it currently leases. 
Petrobras Exploration and Production Director Guilherme Estrella has 
publicly expressed concerns that the company is "running against 
time." 
TUPI FIRST, THEN OTHER PRE-SALT AREAS 
¶3.  Petrobras has only made production evaluation tests at the Tupi 
subsalt field, where it made a recoverable reserve estimate last 
November of between 5-8 billion barrels.  Two more wells will be 
drilled there and a long-term production test will start on Tupi in 
March 2009 to produce 10,000-20,000 barrels per day.  Some 
geologists say that the Carioca subsalt field and three adjacent 
blocks may have probable reserves of over 30 billion barrels.  This 
theory has yet to be confirmed.  So far, Petrobras has been quiet 
saying only that it is a possibility that requires more studies. 
¶4.  Studies not directly related to exploration and production at 
Tupi appear to be temporarily on hold while Petrobras takes stock of 
the resources that it will need to explore the new subsalt frontier. 
 The "Bem-te-vi" field (BMS-8 block), where Petrobras announced a 
light oil find earlier in May, will also have to wait for new 
equipment to get more information about the crude accumulation.  The 
rig from there has been transferred to another subsalt area, known 
as Iara. 
STRATEGIC PLAN FOR EQUIPMENT 
¶5.  With oil prices at record highs, oil exploration equipment is in 
short supply and becoming more expensive.  Renting a deepwater 
drilling rig costs, on average, between $400,000 and $600,000 a day. 
 So, Petrobras has recently launched its "Fleet Support and Support 
Vessel Modernization and Expansion Program," a strategic plan to 
contract the construction of 140 new units to support Petrobras' 
offshore activities at an estimated total of US$5 billion.  This is 
the largest vessel contracting plan of its sort ever in Brazil. 
¶6.  Specifically for the subsalt area, Petrobras plans to contract 
40 drilling ships and platforms to operate in deep and ultra-deep 
waters by 2017.  Though Petrobras says it prefers that the units be 
built in Brazil and has a target of 70-80 percent local content, it 
is questionable if the domestic market is ready to
