SUBJECT: JORNAL DO BRASIL, OBAMA: SHOCK OF HOPE 
 
Shock of Hope 
 
Editorial by Jornal do Brasil (A-8) states: "Barack Obama's 
inauguration speech was an emphatic and direct message to Americans 
and to the world. It was a reaffirmation of hope...an announcement 
that he [Obama] is not there by chance, but for his merit and 
competence. An announcement that he is fully aware of the 
responsibility and magnitude of the challenges of his post... The 
thrilled winner from some months ago gave way to a skilled orator, 
capable of neutralizing the pomp of a symbolic occasion...More 
surprisingly: [Obama] admitted that the way the United States uses 
its energy resources 'strengthens adversaries and threatens our 
planet.' This is a high-impact confession... Foreign policy may see 
a significant change: instead of arrogance,'tempering qualities of 
humility and restraint'... to convince especially the traumatized 
Muslim world... that the planet's biggest power seeks a new path, 
based on mutual interest and respect, both of which were lacking."
