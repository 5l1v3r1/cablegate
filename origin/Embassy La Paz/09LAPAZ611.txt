¶1. (SBU) During April 22 interviews to BBC Mundo and CNN 
Espanol, Bolivian President Evo Morales seemingly sent mixed 
messages regarding any international role in the 
investigation of the April 16 operation against an alleged 
terror cell in Santa Cruz in which three alleged terrorists 
were killed and two were captured(reftels).  Morales 
similarly ran hot and cold on the USG, blasting former U.S. 
Ambassador to Bolivia Philip Goldberg and the DEA while 
praising President Obama and expressing hope for improved 
bilateral relations. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
INVESTIGATION: WITH OR WITHOUT INTERNATIONAL PRESENCE? 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2. (U) When asked about the potential involvement of the 
international community in the investigation in Santa Cruz, 
Morales initially appeared receptive saying, "I am the first 
person to ask for the presence of the international community 
... we have never denied an international community presence 
to investigate this type of anti-democratic group."  He went 
on to invite the Irish and Hungarian governments to 
"investigate ... the documents, films, and photographs." 
However as the interview progressed, Morales became 
increasingly agitated and aggressive in his stance towards an 
international role, specifically from those countries whose 
nationals stand as accused conspirators.  "I want to say that 
the international community is fine, but these countries have 
no  moral authority to conduct their own investigations." 
Morales added, "These authorities ... I don't think that they 
have any ethics." 
 
¶3. (U) When asked about the suspects killed in the Santa Cruz 
fire fight, Morales questioned these governments' interest in 
investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of 
their citizens, targeting both the Hungarian and Irish 
foreign ministers.  First he commented that it was "very odd 
that these government could defend these types of people," in 
response to inquiries from Hungary and Ireland into the 
deaths.  Then he intensified the discourse by implying that 
the governments themselves could have sponsored the 
terrorists, "I'm not linking them (to the cell) ... but it's 
suspicious.  That is my worry." 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
PRAISE FOR OBAMA, ATTACKS ON DEA, AMBASSADOR GOLDBERG 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4. (U)  Complementing previous Morales statements this month 
about the U.S. Embassy and DEA's supposed involvement in an 
assassination attempt against him, Morales returned to 
attacks on Ambassador Goldberg.  He asserted that the 
information uncovered in the investigation supported the 
accusation that Ambassador Goldberg was conspiring against 
his administration.  "I do not regret having expelled ... 
Goldberg ... it is confirmed that he conspired against the 
government and against the national territory."  Morales, 
apparently referring to Ambassador Goldberg's previous 
diplomatic experience in the Balkans, alleged Goldberg "is an 
expert at dividing countries with groups from abroad, now in 
Bolivia."  (Note: Four of the five terror cell suspects are 
of Balkan extraction.  End Note.)  Morales continued to make 
strong accusations against the USG, while at the same time 
praising President Obama and offering hope for an improved 
relationship: "With the new times we expect to improve 
diplomatic relations.  So we have to revise our politics. 
You can't conspire against us nor black mail us.  But if 
there's mutual respect, welcome."  When asked what Bolivia's 
position towards the US government is, Morales responded, 
"The message has to lead to change ... I defend democracy, 
the rights of the state, and legitimate governments ... all 
over the world."
