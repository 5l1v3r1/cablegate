SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED GLOBAL INITIATIVE TO COMBAT 
NUCLEAR TERRORISM 
 
REF: STATE 16451 
 
(SBU) On April 5, Poloff met with the MFA's director of 
international organizations and delivered reftel demarche. 
The director responded that the GOB was unaware of the joint 
United States and Russian Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism.  The director mentioned he would contact 
Bolivia,s embassies in Washington and Moscow to determine if 
they were familiar with the initiative and to "learn more 
about it."  He stated that he would try to provide the GOB's 
response by April 20.  Comment: There is a chance (albeit a 
very small chance) that the department may receive an inquiry 
from the Bolivian Embassy in Washington regarding the 
initiative.  Based upon experience, the April 20 projection 
is perhaps optimistic.  End comment.
