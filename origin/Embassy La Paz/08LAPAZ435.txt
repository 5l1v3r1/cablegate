¶1. (U) Charge d'Affaires Hojjatollah Soltani arrived in 
Bolivia February 25 to open the Iranian Embassy.  The 
building is nearly ready and staff will move in next week. 
Soltani discussed plans to establish a television station in 
the Chapare region with the Bolivian media.  Although the 
station will be called "Radio and Television of Iran," 
Soltani insisted it would be a Bolivian channel "for the 
Bolivian people," and would serve to counter the 
misinformation of U.S.-controlled media.  Soltani said the 
amount of Iranian assistance for the station would depend on 
whether the station will transmit nationally, regionally, 
intercontinentally, or globally -- a decision to be made by 
the Bolivian government.

¶2. (U) Soltani said he did not understand why the project had 
"generated fear" in the United States, likely a reference to 
concerns expressed by Representative Jerry Weller 
(R-Illinois) following a February 19 visit between Bolivian 
President Evo Morales and Codel Engel (reftel a).  AFP 
mentioned the Codel's concerns in its coverage of Soltani's 
remarks.  Soltani noted he found the concerns confusing 
because of the United States "talks all over the world about 
liberty of expression, thought, and liberty to exchange 
information. ...  The United States fears that through these 
transmissions the public will receive the truth about the 
world; they do not want people to search for truth." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Soltani's public statements play into the GOB's 
portrayal of relations with Iran as a counter to U.S. 
influence in the country.  The GOB announced formal 
diplomatic relations with Iran on September 11, 2007.  During 
a much-publicized September 27 trip by Iranian President 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran signed $1.1 billion in cooperation 
agreements.  Other proposals for Bolivian-Iranian cooperation 
include a petrochemical factory and milk processing plants. 
The Bolivian opposition is skeptical about the viability of 
these plans and about Iran's motives, including the suspicion 
that Iran has designs on Bolivian uranium.
