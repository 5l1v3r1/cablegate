SUBJECT: Energy Efficiency Conference in Guangzhou Provides 
Forum for Frank and Open Dialogue 
 
¶1. (U) Under a U.S.-China cooperation program supported by 
USD 1.8 million in USAID funding - and convened by 
Guangzhou's Sun Yat-Sen University School of Law with the 
Vermont Law School and the Institute for Sustainable 
Communities - more than 200 government officials, scholars, 
and business representatives attended a conference in 
Guangzhou on May 11 and 12 to discuss mainland China's 
draft energy efficiency and draft circular economy laws. 
Comments by the participants were collected for submission 
to the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC). 
 
¶2. (U) The conference, at which the Consul General spoke 
about the need for us to prove ourselves capable stewards 
of our limited energy resources, included panel discussions 
by American and Chinese experts on energy efficiency, the 
energy conservation law, and the circular economy law. 
Over 200 people attended the conference, including Sun Yat- 
Sen University President Huang Daren, 60 government 
officials, 60 scholars, 30 business representatives, 20 
representatives from NGOs and research institutes, and 
about 30 students. 
 
¶3. (U) Two roundtable break-out sessions focused on the 
draft laws, allowing all conference participants to discuss 
the impact of the laws on energy and environmental issues. 
(Note: In 2006, China set the target of lowering its energy 
consumption per unit of GDP by 20 percent by 2010 as part 
of the 11th Five-Year Plan.  To meet this goal, China is 
working to amend its eight-year old Energy Efficiency Law 
and create a Circular Economy Law.  End Note.)  Comments 
for submission to the NPC were collected during the 
roundtable sessions.  Press coverage of the event included 
television and newspapers.
