¶1. (SBU) Summary: Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is eager expand 
economic relations with Southeast Asia.  ASEAN already accounts for 
32 percent of its total foreign trade, and the capital, Nanning, 
hosts the high-profile China-ASEAN Expo, which attracts hundreds of 
businesses and many heads of state from Southeast Asia every year. 
Guangxi has dedicated an 18,000 hectare economic zone for investment 
from ASEAN and businesses interested in trade with the bloc.  There 
has also been considerable investment in cross-border 
infrastructure, including roads, port links and power supply. 
Despite these efforts, one well known academic commented that trade 
expansion is limited by the size of markets in ASEAN.  He believes 
that Guangxi's comparative advantage would favor expanding the 
province's trade with more developed markets like the United States. 
 End summary. 
 
Looking South 
------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Government and business in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region 
are eager to leverage the area's proximity to Southeast Asia into 
trade and investment that will drive economic growth.  ASEAN 
countries already account for approximately 32 percent of Guangxi's 
foreign trade at US$2.9 billion in 2007.  Vietnam, which shares a 
400-mile border with Guangxi is the Autonomous Region's largest 
trading partner with US$2.3 billion in trade last year, an amount 
that accounted for 25 percent of total foreign trade.  Singapore, 
Indonesia and Thailand are also major trading partners, each with 
more than US$100 billion in annual trade.  By comparison, Guangxi's 
total trade with the United States was US$700 million. 
 
Putting on a Show 
----------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The annual China-ASEAN Expo is the most high-profile tool 
in Guangxi's strategy to expand trade with Southeast Asia.  The 
trade and investment show hosted by China each year in Nanning 
attracted almost 2,000 companies and other exhibitors in 2007 
(reftel).  Qin Guokan, president of the Guangxi Association of 
Enterprises with Foreign Investment pointed out to econoff that 
since 2004 the event has brought 23 ASEAN heads of state to Nanning. 
 
 
If You Build It... 
------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Guangxi has also established an industrial and commercial 
park covering an area of 18,000 hectares (nearly 45,000 acres) to 
attract investment from ASEAN countries and companies eager to trade 
with the bloc.  Initially aimed at overseas Chinese investors, the 
park's mission was altered in 2004, and it was renamed the 
China-ASEAN Economic Zone.  Zhang Xiangxin, vice director of the 
zone, told us the government has invested RMB 1.4 billion (about 
US$190 million) to develop the infrastructure of the park, including 
52 kilometers of roads, 50 kilometers of electricity lines, and 30 
kilometers of water lines.  The park currently houses 160 
enterprises with output of RMB 2.2 billion (about US$300 million) in 
¶2007.  However, the vast majority of investment in the park is from 
domestic sources, and only a quarter of foreign investment is from 
ASEAN countries.  Most is from Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan and South 
Korea. 
 
Transportation Expansion 
------------------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Chinese government is investing substantially in 
transportation links between Guangxi and ASEAN neighbors.  A highway 
connecting Nanning with the Vietnam border has been completed, 
reducing travel time to just 1.5 hours.  Li Zhiyong, deputy director 
general of the Guangxi Department of Commerce, noted that Beijing 
had recently approved the North Beibu Gulf Economic Cooperation 
program aimed at enhancing transportation links, especially maritime 
links, between six Guangxi cities and six ASEAN partner nations.  In 
addition, the China Development Bank and Asian Development Bank have 
provided loans for infrastructure harmonization between China and 
Vietnam; new projects should further enhance Guangxi's highway, 
railway and port links with its southern neighbor.  There has also

been cross-border collaboration with Vietnam on the development of 
power infrastructure, including planned Guangxi investment in 
thermal power plants in Vietnam. 
 
Advantages and Obstacles 
------------------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) Explaining some of the advantages Guangxi enjoys in 
expanding trade with ASEAN, Professor Li Xinguan of Guangxi 
University's College of Business commented that the autonomous 
region was well positioned to take advantage of the China-ASEAN 
Agreement on Trade in Goods, which has already eliminated tariffs on 
many agricultural products.  He believes Laos and Cambodia are 
particularly promising markets for Guangxi.  However, he noted that 
those markets are limited in size, and he was less optimistic about 
the potential for growth in trade with other ASEAN nations. 
Comparative advantages lend themselves more to expansion of 
Guangxi's trade with the United States rather than trade with ASEAN, 
according to Li.  He also commented that support from Beijing for at 
least one proposal to enhance economic cooperation between Guangxi 
and Vietnam had been weak, leaving Guangxi's government to work with 
provincial counterparts rather than Hanoi.
