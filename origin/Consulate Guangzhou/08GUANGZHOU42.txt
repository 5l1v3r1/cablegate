¶1. (U) Summary: During meetings with key government agencies in 
Guangzhou on January 11, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Market 
Access and Compliance David Bohigian, along with 16 members of his 
'Clean-Energy' Trade Delegation, discussed environmental protection, 
IPR, energy conservation, monitoring and rule of law, as well as 
innovation and technology-sharing. The Chinese side welcomed the 
entry of world class clean energy American companies into the 
market, though initial conversations between U.S. and PRC companies 
yielded few concrete results.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Economic Development and Environmental Protection 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 11, DOC A/S Bohigian and a Clean Energy Trade 
Delegation representing 16 US companies met with Guangdong Executive 
Vice-Governor Huang Longyun and the Development and Reform 
Commission to discuss the development of an energy-efficient economy 
in Guangdong province. During the meeting, Governor Huang outlined 
the province's 2008 development theme, 'Energy Conservation and 
Emissions Reduction,' with its priority on economic development, 
environmental protection and energy conservation.  Huang noted that 
during 2007, Guangdong reduced energy consumption per unit by 3%, 
while also reducing SO2 and CO2 emissions by 3-5%. 
 
¶3. (U) As it works to increase economic development yet protect the 
environment, Guangdong plans to restrict market access in certain 
areas (highly polluting industries, for example) and strengthen 
government monitoring of how these companies comply with government 
regulations.  The Development and Reform Commission has revised its 
catalogue for 'encouraged' and 'discouraged' sector development, 
making 'green energy' a part of Guangdong's ever changing energy 
mix. 
 
¶4. (U) Guangdong currently has a 'green energy' supply shortage and 
relies on other provinces, like Guizhou and Yunnan, for, among other 
resources, water which can be used for the development of wind 
power.  The province, Governor Huang noted, is investing in water 
conservation equipment; he invited U.S. companies to bring their 
rich technical and management experiences to bear in helping develop 
this potentially large clean energy market. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Promoting Innovation & Intellectual Property Protection 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶5. (U) The 'Clean-Energy Trade Delegation' also met with the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences-affiliated Guangzhou Institute of Energy (GIE). 
The GIE, an advisory board for the government's environmental 
policy-making efforts, engages in research in renewable energy 
(biomass, solar, ocean, geothermal), new/alternative energy 
(hydrogen and natural gas hydrate), and energy 
efficiency/environmental protection. 
 
¶6. (SBU) DOC A/S Bohigian said that innovation and intellectual 
property protection are fundamental to future economic development 
in China.  In response to A/S Bohigian's remarks, Wu Tsongzi, the 
Institute's biomass expert, assured the delegation that China's 
government agencies are dedicated to IP protection.  Within the 
Institute itself, multiple efforts have been made to comply with 
government guidelines and general IPR standards.  Wu noted that the 
difficulty of IPR protection lies in understanding how laws apply 
across countries.  He said that efforts to increase IPR protection 
will include signing cooperative agreements between partnering 
corporations and learning more about the practice of IP protection. 
 
¶7. (U) With regard to innovations in China, the Clean Energy 
companies highlighted the use of landfills to create renewable 
energy, specifically with regard to solid waste management.  Wu said 
that waste disposal energy is still in its infancy in China, though 
he noted the large market potential.  Based on Institute analysis, 
Wu identified characteristics associated with China's waste 
management system: 
-- the need for technology diversification to tackle waste 
conversion, 
-- restrictions in urban-area land for waste storage (making it 
necessary to utilize incinerators), and

3) alternatives for small cities, where incinerators can not be used 
economically. 
 
¶8. (U) In response to a question about innovation and technology 
transfer, A/S Bohigian said we needed to further examine the issue. 
Innovation and IPR protection should go hand-in-hand. 
 
--------------------------------- 
The Demands of Energy Consumption 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) In a meeting with A/S Bohigian, members of the Guangdong 
Economic and Trade Commission (ETC) outlined a plan of 'how' to 
create partnerships and policies that will aid in promoting 
U.S.-China economic and trade cooperation in accordance with 
energy-efficiency standards,.  According to director Chen Bing, 
energy conservation is a key challenge.  In 2005, energy consumption 
per unit GDP amounted to 0.7 metric tons of coal.  In 2006, this 
amount was reduced by 2.93%, with an expected reduction of 3.3% 
(pending final 2007 data).  In spite of Beijing's target of reducing 
per unit consumption by 16% as of 2010, Guangdong's consumption 
remains high, approximately 2.3 times higher than U.S. consumption. 
Although Guangdong ranks number one for GDP output in China (latest 
figure is 1/8 of all China's GDP - up from 1/9 a year ago), its 
supply of energy, relative to demand is low.  To subsidize the 
shortage, energy sources such as coal and oil are imported from 
other provinces and from abroad, leaving the province dependent upon 
external supplies. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Energy Conservation: Monitoring and Rule of Law 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶10. (U) To meet these challenges, ETC has implemented a variety of 
mechanisms to promote energy conservation, including the 
establishment of a monitoring system and the promotion of rule of 
law.  With regard to monitoring, ETC in 2005 established a 
leadership group, comprised of 23 representatives from various 
provincial agencies, to target conservation and environmentally 
friendly practices.  In addition, the Commission instituted a 'per 
unit GDP energy response' system. 
 
¶11. (U) ETC also monitors 1,000 high-energy consuming enterprises. 
These enterprises, which are subject to provincial, municipal, and 
local supervision, fall into one of six main sectors: power 
generation, petrochemical, iron and steel, textile, paper making, 
and building material. Among the 1,000, 25 have signed agreements 
with the Guangdong provincial government to reduce consumption, 128 
have signed similar 'provincial agreements' with the ETC, and 800 
remain under city/local supervision.  These enterprises are required 
to undergo energy audits, which the ETC acknowledges is merely an 
administrative effort.  They must also plan their overall energy 
consumption in coordination with government regulations.  By March 
2008, the Central Government will also conduct energy conservation 
appraisals on 1,000 enterprises, 25 of which are located in 
Guangdong. 
 
¶12. (U) The ETC has made a great effort to strengthen legal 
accountability.  A recently amended version of the Energy 
Conservation Law has been passed at the state level with regulations 
regarding penalties for violators. A policy is now being developed 
to impose mandatory standards for 25 key products in the 6 
above-mentioned sectors. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
The Future: More Cooperation and Technology Sharing 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶13. (U) ETC future goals include increased international cooperation 
with individual countries and international organizations as it 
seeks to promote energy-efficient projects and technology exchange. 
ETC welcomed cooperation from foreign companies with 'world-class 
technology' to enter the energy conservation market. 
 
¶14. (U) A/S Bohigian did not have an opportunity to clear this 
cable.
