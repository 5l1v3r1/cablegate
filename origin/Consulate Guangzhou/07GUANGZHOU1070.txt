SUBJECT: Avian Influenza Update: 180,000 Birds Destroyed; No 
Evidence of Animal-to-Human Transmission 
 
REF: A. Guangzhou 1048; B. Hong Kong 2443 
 
¶1. (SBU) Director of the Guangdong Veterinary Center of Epidemic 
Prevention and Control Yu Yedong told us September 20 that the 
Guangzhou government had culled 180,000 fowl from farms within three 
kilometers of Sixian village (Ref A). NOTE: This is an increase from 
the 134,384 ducks, 18,786 chickens, and 150 doves culled by 
September 18. END NOTE. In addition, it mandated a second vaccine 
injection for poultry located near the infection area. These steps 
supplement the September 18 decision by the Panyu district 
government to suspend the operation of poultry markets located 
within the thirteen-kilometer-radius infection surveillance zone. 
Hong Kong authorities have also taken steps to prevent the 
introduction of avian influenza there (Ref B). 
 
No Human Cases

¶2. (SBU) Guangdong Department of Health Emergency Response Office 
Director Wu Yueqi told us that more than 60 people who had been in 
contact with the infected ducks -- including farmers and quarantine 
staff -- have had blood tests and are under a seven-day medical 
observation. No flu-like symptoms have yet been reported from this 
group. The Department of Health continues to stress the surveillance 
of flu and pneumonia-like symptoms with unknown causes.
