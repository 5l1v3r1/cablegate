¶1. (U) Summary: High-level Chinese and ASEAN officials agreed the 
text of a maritime agreement and a statement on food safety during 
meetings at the Fourth China-ASEAN Expo in Nanning.  The trade 
fair-like Expo and related events in Nanning reinforce China's 
commitment to further develop relations with its Southeast Asian 
neighbors.  End summary. 
 
Pulling Out the Stops 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 
south China, played host this week to a series of events aimed at 
strengthening China's economic cooperation with ASEAN.  The Fourth 
China-ASEAN Expo opened on October 28 with all the fanfare 
associated with China's impressive trade shows.  Vice Premier Zeng 
Peiyuan represented China at the opening ceremony.  ASEAN 
representatives included several heads of government, namely 
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen 
Tan Dung, and Laotian Prime Minister Bouasone Bouphavanh.  Crown 
Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah of Brunei also attended.  Most of the 
other ASEAN countries were represented by cabinet ministers.  On the 
same day, many of the same leaders opened the China-ASEAN Business 
and Investment Summit (CABIS). 
 
¶3. (U) Nearly 2,000 enterprises participated in the Expo, which 
closed on October 31.  Most of the booths were occupied by Chinese 
companies, organizations, and government agencies.  ASEAN entities 
occupied one-third of the booths.  Expo organizers announced that 
trade contracts signed at the event reached a total value of US$1.4 
billion, up 12 percent from last year.  There were also 182 
investment deals signed with a total value of US$6.2 billion, 5 
percent more than a year ago. 
 
Focus on Transportation 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The ASEAN-China Port Development and Cooperation Forum was 
another concurrent event in Nanning and was the focus of many of the 
visiting ASEAN officials.  According to media reports, the Forum 
reached consensus on a draft ASEAN-China Maritime Transportation 
Agreement that is slated to be signed at the 6th ASEAN-China 
Transport Ministers' Meeting in Singapore in early November.  In 
addition, the officials agreed on a Strategic Plan for ASEAN-China 
Transport Cooperation. 
 
Food Safety Too 
--------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Chinese and ASEAN officials who participated in the events 
in Nanning also issued a joint statement on food safety.  The 
statement called for an exchange of information on food safety 
regulations and standards.  A Guangzhou-based ASEAN diplomat told 
Congenoff that China had lobbied ASEAN countries heavily to issue 
this statement. 
 
Comment - Soft Power in Action 
------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) China's investment, especially at senior government levels 
(Wen Jiabao delivered the opening address at the 15th anniversary of 
the establishment of the China-ASEAN Dialogue last October 31 in 
Nanning) in the events this week testifies to its ongoing commitment 
to develop relations with its Southeast Asian neighbors.  The trade 
fair-like Exposition appeared to be an effective way to use economic 
muscle to further strengthen ties and to make a political statement. 
 High-level participation by ASEAN members, especially those from 
Indochina, suggests that Southeast Asian countries are responding to 
China's efforts.
