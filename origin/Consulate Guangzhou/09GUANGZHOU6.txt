IN HONG KONG 
 
¶1. Summary: An eleven-week old girl who resides in Shenzhen has 
reportedly contracted the H9N2 strain of avian influenza (AI).  She 
is being treated in a Hong Kong hospital.  Some medical experts have 
expressed concern that the H9N2 virus, which is less virulent than 
H5N1, may have mutated because the girl did not initially exhibit a 
fever.  Shenzhen officials are investigating the source of the 
infection, but have not yet released any findings.  End summary. 
 
¶2. According to media reports, an eleven-week old girl living in 
Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, contracted the H9N2 strain of AI and 
is now being treated at Tuen Mun Hospital in Hong Kong.  The girl 
was born in Hong Kong, and her parents took her to Tuen Mun Hospital 
there on December 22 after she exhibited coughing and vomiting. 
Because she had no fever, the hospital did not suspect AI after her 
first admission.  She was discharged the next day and returned with 
her parents to Shenzhen.  Her parents took her back to Tuen Mun 
Hospital on December 29, after which blood tests determined she was 
infected with H9N2, which is less virulent than the H5N1 strain. 
Media reports indicate she is in stable condition, but still has an 
elevated white blood cell count, which doctors suspect may be due to 
causes other than the AI infection.  They are testing her for 
leukemia. 
 
¶3. Medical experts are reportedly concerned that the H9N2 virus may 
have mutated because the girl did not initially develop a fever. 
Hong Kong and Guangdong health officials have been in contact with 
each other to speed investigation of the infection source. 
 
¶4. Shenzhen officials have sent a team to investigate the 
residential area in Shenzhen's Nansha District, where the patient 
lived, and indicated they would release an update when more 
information is available.  They advised local residents to reduce 
contact with live poultry.  The patient's doctor in Hong Kong told 
reporters that the family did not raise chickens and that other 
members of the family have not displayed any symptoms of the virus. 
 
 
¶5. This cable was coordinated with Embassy Beijing and Consulate 
General Hong Kong.
