¶1. (SBU) Summary and comment: Although China is making gradual 
progress towards greater economic diversification, cheap exports 
will continue to drive growth in the near term, according to 
comments made by local economic analysts during a conversation with 
the Consul General, visiting Deputy Director of the China Desk and 
Beijing Poloff on January 26.  The recovery of overseas orders and 
the return to profitability for regional industries have not 
translated into higher wages for most workers, meaning that real 
estate and automobile prices are unaffordable for most local 
consumers.  As new technology and higher value-added industries 
emerge, the recent multi-year import surge may lose some steam as 
firms develop local alternatives and cease importing higher-priced 
foreign goods.  End summary and comment. 
 
----------------------------- 
EXPORTS STILL TOP BREADWINNER 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Guangdong Citibank Branch President Peter Qiu told us that 
despite thin margins and regulatory pressures to relocate out of 
their traditional Pearl River Delta base (refs A and B), low 
value-added manufacturing industries recovered enough in 2009 to 
continue operations.  Neither domestic demand for surplus goods 
originally produced for export nor high-tech manufacturing output 
have been robust enough to reverse south China's reliance on 
export-oriented growth in the near term.  Qiu commented that the 
government could be expected to take a more cautious approach to 
infrastructure stimulus, but it would likely continue with efforts 
to stimulate domestic consumption. 
 
¶3. (SBU) While exports continue to be the major source of growth in 
China, there are also signs that a recent multi-year import surge 
may taper off as local production increasingly displaces imports. 
Price Waterhouse Coopers Partner Alfred Leung highlighted heavy 
machinery as an example of a good that was until recently imported 
but is now increasingly produced locally.  Qiu affirmed this 
analysis, noting that the displacement of exports to China from 
Southeast Asian countries had become a source of friction. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
EXCHANGE RATE DEFENSE KEY TO STABILITY 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Leung also commented that the defense of the current 
renminbi exchange rate should be seen as an effort to maintain 
economic stability rather than as a barrier to imports.  Local oil 
and gas prices have been allowed to almost double in the last four 
years, even as domestic automobile sales surged in 2009 and wages 
failed to increase at the same rate as real estate prices, according 
to Leung.  The resulting economic situation looked "almost like the 
economy is overheating," he said. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
SHIFTING MIGRATION, ENERGY USE PATTERNS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Both Qiu and Leung said labor shortages had begun to 
develop in Guangdong-based manufacturing industries such as textiles 
and shoes towards the end of 2009.  Flat wages, increased living 
costs and improved transportation infrastructure connecting 
manufacturing centers with newly developing inland areas have all 
caused a shift in migrant labor patterns such that laborers are now 
more likely to consider staying close to their rural hometowns than 
relocate to the Pearl River Delta.  Guangdong Oil and Gas 
Association Secretary General Helen Liang added that energy 
consumption patterns also indicated a gradual migration of 
industrial output from traditional coastal centers to more inland 
areas.  Liang said energy consumption had not recovered to 
pre-recession levels in the Pearl River Delta, but that inland areas

were showing signs of sustained growth.
