REF: ANKARA 1626 
 
Classified By: DCM Doug Silliman, reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary:  The Turkish MFA proudly points to Prime 
Minister Erdogan's October 30 letter to Greece as a positive 
step for the future of bilateral relations between the two 
countries, but admits that much depends on Greece's response 
-- and the ongoing Cyprus negotiations.  In the letter, 
Erdogan touched on almost every major bilateral issue, from 
the minority rights to illegal immigration.  MFA officials 
insist that Turkey has the political will to move relations 
forward.  However, the resumption of Turkish overflights of 
Greek islands in the Aegean could complicate things.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) PM Erdogan sent a three-page letter to Greek Prime 
Minister George Papandreou on October 30 in response to 
Papandreou's visit to Istanbul on October 9 (scanned copy of 
letter sent to EUR/SE 11/12).  During a November 10 meeting 
with the DCM, MFA Deputy Under Secretary Halit Cevik passed 
us a copy of the missive.  It listed Cyprus, Aegean matters, 
minority issues, and illegal immigration as key bilateral 
priorities for Turkey.  According to Cevik, the inclusion of 
illegal migration, for example, is significant because of the 
importance Athens places on the issue.  He said Greece has 
not yet responded to the letter, but noted that Ankara 
understands a reply is underway.  The Greek Embassy here has 
also told us that it expects a response soon. 
 
¶3. (C) The sending of the letter received widespread press 
coverage.  Excerpts on key topics include: 
 
-- Cyprus: Ankara is encouraging the Turkish Cypriots to seek 
settlement and Athens should do the same with the Greek 
Cypriots.  Turkey suggests a meeting of four international 
players on Cyprus when the talks reach an appropriate level 
(Note: The level was not specified. End Note) 
-- Aegean matters: Turkey offers to accelerate exploratory 
talks, adopt new Confidence Building Measures, and agree to a 
"Code of Conduct" between the two countries for the safe 
conduct of military flights in the Aegean.  The Code of 
Conduct would be "non-prejudicial"; that is, it could not be 
cited as precedent in any future process that might seek to 
define respective sovereign rights in the Aegean. 
-- EU accession: Erdogan said he is aware of the positive 
attitudes of Papandreou regarding Turkey's EU bid, and 
offered to boost cooperation.  U/S Cevik personally commented 
that Greece's EU veto power is pivotal and should not be used 
to negate negotiations. 
-- Minority issues: Erdogan recognized that the situation of 
minorities in both countries needs to be addressed. 
-- Illegal immigration: the PM noted that this problem 
impacts both Turkey and Greece, and offered cooperation in 
the fight against criminal networks involved in smuggling 
refugees. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Both the Turkish MFA and the Greek Embassy agreed 
that Cyprus is the key issue that continues to adversely 
affect bilateral relations.  Cevik said that Turkey gives all 
the support it can to "TRNC President" Mehmet Ali Talat. 
Cevik and other MFA officials contend that Turkey has the 
political will to realize a Cyprus solution, but argue that 
the Greek Cypriots seem to want to buy time.  He suggested 
that the "TRNC Presidential" elections in April are a 
"natural deadline:" every second year, elections on one side 
or the other of the island bring about the suspension of 
talks, but also an opportunity to push progress forward.  The 
DCM said that the US is encouraged that both sides leaders 
remain publicly and privately committed to the process.  The 
Greek Embassy, however, told us that Turkey's actions in 
December regarding the Ankara Additional Protocol will be 
crucial for both bilateral relations and the Cyprus 
negotiations.  (Comment: The Greek Embassy's talking points 
may be dated.  End Comment)  Our Greek colleagues emphasized 
that Greece has been waiting for roughly three years for 
movement from Ankara on the Additional Ankara Protocol. 
Moreover, EU accession cannot progress without movement on 
Cyprus and Athens needs concrete proposals for action, not a 
restatement of the issues.

¶5. (C) The positive direction of the bilateral relationship 
also could be stalled with Turkey's resumption of Aegean 
overflights.  The DCM noted positively Turkey's suspension of 
overflights of Greek islands during the election and 
government formation periods in Greece, but reiterated strong 
USG objections to such overflights, particularly over 
Farmakonisi and Agathonisi islands, which the US considers to 
be sovereign Greek territory per the 1947 Treaty of Paris. 
(Note: The Ambassador made the same points to Under Secretary 
Sinirlioglu (REFTEL). End Note)  Cevik responded the 
suspension was only temporary, due to the Greek Parliamentary 
elections, and that Turkey had resumed its overflights on 6 
November.  He would not comment over which islands were 
involved.  Cevik argued that it was not a sovereignty issue, 
but rather mere "flight formations." 
 
¶6. (SBU) Looking ahead, Cevik suggested that Greece's 
response to the letter and a Turkish reciprocal visit by FM 
Davutoglu- probably before the December EU summit, could help 
set the tone for future relations.

COMMENT

¶7. (C) PM Papandreou's journey to Istanbul in October and his 
visit to former FM Cem's gravesite drew prominent press 
coverage and a positive emotional response from most Turks. 
Papandreou is held in high regard here.  That set a promising 
tone as prelude for the Erdogan overture.  However, the path 
ahead is hardly clear.  The apparent resumption of Turkish 
overflights of Greek islands will be a complicating factor. 
Turkish MFA officials take comfort that Papandreou knows the 
deep-seated issues that serve as tripwires for the bilateral 
relationship.
