SUBJECT: SUSPENSION OF TITLE III OF LIBERTAD ACT - URUGUAY 
 
REF: STATE 191752 
 
Classified By: Charge d'Affaires James D. Nealon, 
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Upon taking office on March 1, 2005, the 
left-of-center Frente Amplio government immediately renewed 
diplomatic relations with Cuba, which had been previously 
suspended by the Batlle administration.  This move appears to 
have been a gesture by President Vazquez to the more radical 
elements of his coalition, including Foreign Minister 
Gargano, a strong proponent of stronger ties with Cuba. 
Gargano and many in the Frente Amplio regularly criticize the 
U.S. embargo on Cuba.  The GOU opened an Embassy in Havana on 
June 30, 2005, and Cuba's ambassador to Uruguay was sworn in 
on November 7, 2005. 
 
¶2. (C) The only two ministerial-level visits to Cuba occurred 
earlier this year, one in January 2006 by Social Programs 
Minister Arismendi (Communist Party), and the other in April 
2006, when Health Minister Munoz accompanied a group of 
Uruguayan patients for treatment in Cuba.  Agriculture 
Minister and ex-Tupamaro guerilla Jose Mujica accompanied 
Munoz on that occasion.  The only high-level Cuban visit to 
Uruguay was the presence of Vice-President Carlos Lage at the 
Ibero-American Summit of November 2006.  Last year, the GOU 
accepted Cuba's offer to conduct ophtalmological 
interventions free of charge for Uruguayan cataract patients, 
under a program called ""Operacion Milagro"" (""Operation 
Miracle"").  Over 1,300 patients have been treated so far. 
The initiative has raised strong protests from the Uruguayan 
Association of Ophtalmologists.  The Cuban government also 
offers scholarships for Uruguayan medical students, with 
about 40 Uruguayan medical students graduating in Cuba every 
year.  Post is not aware of any Uruguayan investments in Cuba 
or Cuban investments in Uruguay, nor of any bilateral trade 
agreements between Uruguay and Cuba. 
 
¶3. (C) The GOU's involvement with Cuba appears quite limited 
to a few areas of medical cooperation and to some expressions 
of support by the more radical elements of the Frente Amplio 
government.  Minister Arismendi was ridiculed by large 
sections of the Frente and by the opposition when she 
suggested, upon her return from Cuba, that Uruguay apply 
Cuban ""experiences"" in the area of education.  While Post is 
not aware of any declarations by the GOU criticizing the 
human rights situation in Cuba, ForMin Gargano had to 
publicly admit that Cuba is not a democracy, after he was 
criticized for suggesting that Cuba be admitted into Mercosur 
in May 2005.  Other Mercosur members and several of Gargano's 
Cabinet colleagues pointed out to Gargano that Cuba would not 
fullfill the ""democracy clause"" condition for Mercosur 
membership.
