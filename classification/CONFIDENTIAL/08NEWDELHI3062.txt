SUBJECT: MUMBAI TERROR ATTACKS:  MUKHERJEE-ZARDARI CALL DID NOT TAKE PLACE 
 
REF: A. NEW DELHI 3037 
     ¶B. NEW DELHI 3024 
 
Classified By: Ambassador David Mulford for Reasons 1.4 (B and D) 

¶1. (C) Post now believes that Indian External Affairs 
Minister Pranab Mukherjee did not in fact phone Pakistan 
President Asif Ali Zardari November 28 despite conflicting 
reports from the Indian Government.  Ministry of External 
Affairs Joint Secretary (Americas) Gaitri Kumar had 
originally told PolCouns December 1 that the call did take 
place.  However, National Security Advisor Narayanan told the 
Ambassador later on December 1 that no such call took place, 
and that he would have known if it had (ref A). 

¶2. (C) To clear up the confusion, J/S Kumar shared with 
PolCouns December 3 a version of events that Post assesses to 
be factually correct and consistent with what Narayanan told 
Ambassador Mulford, a November 28 MEA press release, and 
Mukherjee's own account to Secretary Rice in their meeting 
December 3 (septel).  Kumar shared that Mukherjee had last 
spoken directly with Zardari in an informal setting during 
his May visit to Islamabad, before Zardari was elected 
President, adding that he had ""never"" spoken with Zardari by 
phone.  Since then, Mukherjee had only spoken to his 
counterpart, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.  Qureshi 
was in India when the Mumbai attacks began, but departed 
early without completing his program.  Mukherjee then spoke 
to Qureshi -- not Zardari -- by phone the evening of November 
¶28.  According to Kumar, Mukherjee did not convey any 
threats, but rather read the talking points shared with the 
Ambassador by Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon on November 
29 (ref B).  When asked by media about the conversation, 
Qureshi reportedly confirmed that no threats were issued. 
Kumar gave no explanation for the discrepancy between this 
report and her report on December 1.  (Note:  Post suspects 
she incorrectly inferred that a Mukherjee-Zardari call took 
place from the fact that Mukherjee's office had, as a 
precaution, prepared points for him to use if Zardari were to 
phone Prime Minister Singh when he was unavailable, leaving 
Mukherjee to receive the call.  End Note.)
