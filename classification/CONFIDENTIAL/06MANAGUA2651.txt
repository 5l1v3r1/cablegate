SUBJECT: CONSERVATIVE PARTY PRESIDENT DELIBERATES ALLIANCE 
WITH ALN, ROLE IN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
 
REF: MANAGUA 2059 
 
Classified By: Charge d'affaires Peter M. Brennan. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY: Conservative Party (PC) president Azalia 
Aviles Salmeron is determined to maintain her party's 
affiliation with Eduardo Montealegre's Nicaraguan Liberal 
Alliance (ALN), but not to the detriment of the PC's role in 
the National Assembly.  According to PC by-laws, Conservative 
lawmakers should establish their own caucus in the Assembly, 
but Aviles is reluctant to form a separate caucus if doing so 
would endanger the future of the ALN-PC alliance.  She 
believes that if Montealegre is willing to name the caucus 
ALN-PC, instead of ALN, and if Conservative lawmakers in the 
alliance are given leadership roles, maintaining one caucus 
would be more viable.  Aviles claims that some of 
Montealegre's advisors are misguiding him and he is not 
giving leaders of allied parties the respect and political 
space they merit.  We have encouraged her to raise these 
concerns with Montealegre and the presidents of other 
ALN-allied parties and will meet with Montealegre within the 
next few days to impress upon him the importance of 
cultivating and consolidating his alliance.  END SUMMARY. 
 
A MATTER OF RESPECT 
- - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶2.  (C) On December 2, Conservative Party (PC) president 
Azalia Aviles Salmeron conveyed to polcouns her growing 
frustration over the "negative" influence of certain advisors 
of ALN leader/former presidential candidate Eduardo 
Montealegre.  According to Aviles, Eliseo Nunez, Jr. and Sr., 
along with Mauricio Montealegre, have built a "wall" around 
Eduardo Montealegre, making access to him difficult for her 
and for most of the other presidents of ALN-allied parties. 
As a case in point, she mentioned that Eduardo Montealegre 
recently visited PC headquarters in Granada as part of his 
post-election recognition of departmental support.  However, 
while PC Assembly deputies were invited to the event, the ALN 
did not invite Aviles, who attended anyway. 
 
¶3.  (C) Following the Granada incident, Aviles met with 
Montealegre and conveyed her concern that the ALN is not 
respecting the lines of communication and her role as 
Conservative party president.  She related that Montealegre 
was receptive and reminded her that he has told alliance 
party leaders that the consolidation of the ALN depends in 
large part on the strength of its member parties.  Aviles 
acknowledged that part of the problem lies within the 
Conservatives themselves, sharing that Montealegre's 
PC-associated running mate Fabricio Cajina had let his 
position "get to his head" and Cajina had tried to assume 
leadership of the party when he does not have the authority. 
 
THE GOOD OF NICARAGUA OUR FIRST COMMITMENT

¶4.  (C) Despite her frustration with the ALN leadership, 
Aviles insisted she does not want to form a separate caucus 
if doing so would endanger the future of the ALN-PC alliance. 
 She reiterated her commitment to the alliance "for the good 
of Nicaragua."  Nonetheless, Aviles was equally adamant that 
she cannot afford to allow the PC's relationship with the ALN 
to hurt her party's participation in the National Assembly. 
She explained that according to PC by-laws, Conservative 
lawmakers are expected to form their own caucus in the 
Assembly if they qualify, and they do because five 
Conservative deputies will join the new Assembly in January. 
(Note/Comment: A minimum of four deputies are required to 
form a caucus.  By forming its own caucus, the PC would 
benefit from substantial administrative support and maintain 
its party identity.  End Note/Comment.) 
 
OTHER ALN ALLIES SHARE FRUSTRATION

¶5.  (C) Evangelical leader/current Assembly deputy Delia 
Arellano, who broke with her Camino Cristiano party to 
support Montealegre's candidacy and was not re-elected, was 
also present at the meeting.  Arellano said she had warned 
Montealegre not to place Nicaraguan Resistance Party (PRN) 
turncoat Salvador Talavera (Reftel) so high on his slate of 
Assembly candidates (third) because he was not trustworthy; 
now Talavera would vote with the FSLN bloc in the Assembly. 
She also lamented the fact that she was relegated to ninth 
place and thus was not re-elected.  Even so, Arellano said 
she is determined to support Montealegre and recently met 
with him to present a strategy to attract more evangelicals 
to the ALN cause, in part as a way for the alliance to make 
inroads into Nicaragua's deep-rural population where many 
evangelists reside.  According to Arellano, up to 40% of 
Nicaragua's population is evangelical.  (Note:  According to 
the 2005 census, 55% of Nicaraguans aged five and older are 
Catholic, 22% evangelical, 16% no stated religious 
preference, and 4% of another religion.  End Note.) 
 
¶6.  (C) According to Aviles, she is not the only party leader 
allied with Montealegre that is frustrated over Montealegre's 
lack of attention to his allies' needs.  Aviles related that 
Nicaraguan Resistance Party (PRN) leader Luis Fley (septel) 
and other PRN "commandantes" had shared similar frustrations 
and felt marginalized by the ALN "watchdogs" Nunez-Mauricio 
Montealegre.  Further, Alliance for the Republic (APRE) 
President Miguel Lopez Baldizon was poised to withdraw APRE 
from the ALN alliance, warned Aviles.  (Note: Lopez Baldizon 
is currently in Japan.  We will meet with him upon his 
return.  End Note.) Polcouns reiterated the need for direct 
communication and urged Aviles to talk with Montealegre 
directly.  She agreed to do so and will also meet with the 
other disaffected party leaders to broach with Montealegre 
constructive ideas to strengthen the alliance. 
 
A POSSIBLE WAY FORWARD 
- - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶7.  (C) Aviles suggested that naming the caucus ALN-PC, 
instead of ALN, would offer a way out of the conundrum.  She 
added that according Conservative lawmakers in the ALN-PC 
caucus "leadership roles" would help, for example allowing PC 
deputy Javier Vallejo Fernandez (Granada) to serve as the VP 
of the ALN-PC caucus.  To lead the joint caucus, recognizing 
that the presidency of the caucus should go to an ALN member, 
Aviles suggested that ALN deputy Luis Callejas (Chinandega) 
would be a suitable candidate, as he is young and a "fresh 
face" that would demonstrate to the public that the ALN is 
not merely a "PLC retread." 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - 
 
¶8.  (C) If the Conservative Party forms its own caucus from 
the get-go, the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) 
and the Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC) will likely claim 
that this move spells the demise of Montealegre's alliance. 
Further complicating the ALN's integrity is the increasing 
fragmentation of PRN leaders, including some who have 
publicly stated that the PRN's alliance with the ALN ended 
after the electoral period and possibly the estrangement of 
the APRE president.  Montealegre's reliance on the Nunez 
family and his cousin Mauricio Montealegre has been 
problematic in the past, and Aviles' observations about their 
inordinate control over the ALN are not unique.  We will meet 
with Eduardo Montealegre within the next few days to share 
these concerns and impress upon him the importance of 
cultivating and consolidating his alliance.
