SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) President Martin Torrijos has chosen Raul Rodriguez 
to be the new President of the National Assembly, replacing 
Pedro Miguel Gonzalez (PMG) who is under federal indictment 
in connection with the 1992 murder of a U.S. serviceman. 
Sources from both the ruling Democratic Revolutionary Party 
(PRD) and leading opposition party (Panamenista party) have 
shared this information in recent days.  END SUMMARY 
 
--------------------- 
PMG Out, Rodriguez in 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) PRD majority leader and National Assembly Deputy 
Leandro Avila told POLOFF on July 24 that President Torrijos 
had called Raul Rodriguez on July 23 to give him the news of 
his selection.  According to Avila, this decision was made in 
conjunction with leading Presidential candidate Balbina 
Herrera, who was close to current National Assembly 
President, Pedro Miguel Gonzalez (PMG).  (NOTE:  PMG is under 
indictment in the United States in connection with the 1992 
murder of a U.S. soldier).  Avila said that although Herrera 
remained close to PMG, her relationship with the U.S. was of 
great importance and she did not want PMG to be an obstacle 
to strengthening that relationship.  Also, Herrera was also 
keeping at a distance PRD National Assembly Deputy Hector 
Aleman, a strong supporter of PMG's candidacy for Assembly 
President and frequent critic of the U.S. 
 
¶3.  (C) Panamenista National Assembly Deputy Alcibiades 
Vasquez confirmed this story in a conversation with POLOFF on 
July 25.  Vasquez characterized it as an order directly from 
Torrijos. 
 
¶4.  (U) Raul Rodriguez is a National Assembly Deputy in his 
first term, who has worked at the Electoral Tribunal.  He has 
previously served as Vice-president of the Assembly (NOTE: 
Although Assembly sessions run for five years, leadership is 
elected yearly.)  The PRD caucus in the National Assembly 
will meet in the coming weeks to formally select its 
candidate to be the chamber's president.  Controlling 45 of 
the chamber's 75 seats, it is a foregone conclusion that 
whomever the PRD caucus chooses will be the next President of 
the National Assembly.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5.  (C) PMG is widely perceived by the political class in 
Panama to be the reason that the U.S. has not yet ratified 
the Free Trade Agreement (FTA).  He will continue to have a 
role in politics as a member of the PRD's National Executive 
Committee (CEN).  Although Herrera, the leading Presidential 
candidate from the ruling PRD, is putting distance between 
herself and PMG during the political season, they remain 
close.  In stepping aside, PMG is fulfilling the commitment 
he made in a letter to Torrijos in May to not run for 
re-election.  END COMMENT
