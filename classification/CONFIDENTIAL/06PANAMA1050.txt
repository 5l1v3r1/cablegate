Â¶1.  (SBU)  Ambassador Eaton delivered talking points (reftel) 
to FM Samuel Lewis yesterday afternoon.  Lewis told 
Ambassador Eaton that he welcomed the U.S. initiative and 
would look for an opportunity to make a public statement. 
Lewis also said he hoped that this bold and welcome step by 
the U.S. would encourage a diplomatic solution to the 
worrisome Iranian ambition to obtain nuclear capabilities.
