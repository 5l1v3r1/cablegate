Classified By: DCM Michael A. Butler for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C/REL FRANCE/UK)  On October 8 DCM delivered REFTEL 
points to MFA Political Director Teemu Tanner, accompanied by 
French DCM Frederic Joureau and British DCM Philip Malone. 
Joureau and Malone reinforced DCM's points: Joureau raised 
specific concerns about the clandestine uranium enrichment 
facility located near Qom, in particular by citing the need 
to maintain pressure on Iran regarding an IAEA inspection; 
Malone welcomed the talks as a good first step but emphasized 
the importance of additional confidence-building measures 
from the Iranian side. 
 
¶2. (C/REL FRANCE/UK) Tanner expressed appreciation for the 
three governments' willingness to share information about the 
talks, and welcomed the Administration,s direct engagement 
with Iran.  He pointed out that the Finnish government (GoF) 
had long supported the P5 1 process, and stated that the 
GoF's "unwavering support" continues.  Tanner said the Finns 
know full well that the only measure of success will be 
&concrete results8 and that the international community 
must see such results by the end of the year.  He agreed that 
the international community must consider sanctions if the 
current dialogue does not result in concrete Iranian actions. 
 The GoF supports the EU's decision to examine possible 
additional sanctions.  It prefers sanctions via the UN 
Security Council, but is fully prepared to consider 
"autonomous sanctions" from the EU and US, with as wide 
support as possible. Tanner also expressed interest in the 
points the Iranians raised, as well as the level of support 
and engagement exhibited by the Russian and Chinese 
participants. 
 
¶3. (C/REL FRANCE/UK) In addressing Finland's support for 
efforts to press Iran to keep to commitments made at Geneva, 
Tanner said that the GoF presses Iran on nonproliferation and 
human rights matters at every opportunity (the most recent 
being a bilateral meeting between Foreign Ministers last 
month on the margins of UNGA).  Tanner promised to discuss 
with Foreign Minister Stubb the possibility of a public 
statement pressing Iran to keep to its commitments and 
supporting the dual track strategy. (NOTE: Post coordinated 
this message with British and French DCMs. END NOTE.)
