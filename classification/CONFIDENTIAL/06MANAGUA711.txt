REF: MANAGUA 0642 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Outspoken National Assembly deputy Delia 
Arellano plans to actively recruit "converts" in the 
evangelical community to support presidential candidate 
Eduardo Montealegre now that she has become a member of 
Montealegre's ALN-PC caucus (reftel).  Arellano backs a 
proposal to chose a woman as the ALN-PC vice presidential 
candidate, and she personally prefers former Tourism 
Institute director Lucia Salazar for the position.  She 
predicts that Francisco Aguirre Sacasa will emerge as the PLC 
presidential candidate and has encouraged independent deputy 
Jaime Morales Carazo to pursue the FSLN vice presidential 
nomination.  Arellano is also concerned that FSLN mayors in 
Leon are taking credit for MCC programs to support political 
goals.  End Summary. 
 
THE "RIGHT TIME" TO JOIN EDUARDO

¶2. (C) Pol Counselor and poloff met with National Assembly 
deputy Delia Arellano on March 24 to discuss her move from 
the Camino Cristiano (CCN) bancada to the ALN-PC.  Arellano, 
who previously told poloffs on several occasions that she 
intended to defect to Eduardo Montealegre,s bancada, 
explained that she had to wait for the "right time" to 
announce her move so she would not look like an opportunist 
betraying the CCN.  This opportunity came, she said, when CCN 
leader Rev. Guillermo Osorno made apparent his intentions to 
seek an alliance with the PLC and implied that he may vote in 
favor of an amnesty for convicted PLC leader Arnoldo Aleman. 
Arellano stated that such a posture is contrary to her 
Christian beliefs, and one that she can not support. 
(Comment: For some time, Delia has been uncomfortable 
following Osorno, disparagingly named "Reverend Soborno 
(bribe)" by some.  She enjoys a strong personal relationship 
with Montealegre, and now she does not have to hide her 
inclinations.  End Comment.) 
 
¶3. (C) Arellano was very enthusiastic in her support for 
Montealegre and raved about his performance before a March 23 
COSEP panel.  (Note: Other contacts were similarly laudatory 
towards Montealegre.  Nelson Estrada, the panel,s moderator, 
only criticized Montealegre for supporting the 6% set-aside 
in the national budget for universities, which is part of the 
Sandinista platform to assure loyalty from university 
students and professors -- at the expense of primary 
education and other priorities.  End Note.)  She claimed that 
Montealegre is making considerable headway with women and 
youth.  Arellano reported that she is encouraging Montealegre 
to select a female vice presidential running mate.  Of the 
leading candidates, Delia prefers former Tourism Institute 
director Lucia Salazar, a "friendly and dynamic" woman, to 
Cristiana Chamorro, who she described as "cold and distant." 
Other possibilities include Azalia Aviles, Maria Cecilia 
Castellon, Jamileth Bonilla, Vivian Pellas, and Arellano 
herself. 
 
¶4. (C) Arellano claimed that she is actively recruiting 
evangelicals for Montealegre.  She remarked that some have 
expressed concern that they would have to become "Liberals" 
and abandon their political connection to the CCN, but 
Arellano explained that they can join the "Vamos con Eduardo" 
movement, which is not a political party and encompasses 
members from many different political ideologies.  Arellano 
favors holding multi-party primaries to unite the democratic 
forces that would include CCN deputy candidates.  Delia was 
receptive to making violence against women a campaign issue, 
noting the low penalties for statutory rape among 14-16 year 
olds proposed in the new Criminal Code and Nicaragua's high 
prevalence of domestic violence. 
 
DELIA'S PLC AND FSLN CANDIDATE PREDICTIONS

¶5. (C) Delia also commented on possible PLC and FSLN 
candidates.  She mentioned that independent deputy Jaime 
Morales told her that he will be Daniel Ortega,s running 
mate.  Arellano deliberately encouraged his ambitions, 
confiding to poloffs that Morales is known as "The 
Inquisitor" to many evangelicals for trying to impose laws 
that would restrict their worship services, and predicting 
his candidacy would alienate many evangelicals.  Regarding 
the upcoming PLC primary, Arellano opined that Francisco

Aguirre Sacasa will become the PLC,s presidential candidate, 
though did not elaborate on why Aguirre Sacasa would win the 
primaries. 
 
EVANGELICALS CLAIM SANDINISTAS TAKING CREDIT FOR MCC PROGRAMS

¶6. (C) Arellano voiced concern that the Sandinistas are 
exploiting the MCC to advance their own campaigns in Leon, 
citing the fact that an evangelical pastor was recruited to 
join the Sandinistas with promises of funds for programs that 
will benefit the community.  Delia claimed that these 
programs are MCC-related but the Sandinistas are not selling 
them as such, taking the credit for them. 
 
¶7. (C) Comment: Post occasionally receives hearsay comments 
of this type from various contacts.  MCC Director has met 
with different groups on several occasions to dispel rumors 
regarding the management of MCC funds, clarifying that local 
mayors have very limited influence over the management and 
distribution of funds.  Disbursement and procurement for the 
program will be managed by an international private sector 
firm.  Arellano is willing to facilitate a similar meeting 
with the evangelical pastors from Leon. 
 
¶8. (C) Comment continued: While the risk always exists that 
local leaders of any political affiliation may attempt to 
exploit USG assistance for their own ends, post notes that 
mayors in Leon and Chinandega have, by and large, been a 
positive factor in the development of the MCC program. 
Specifically, many Sandinista mayors appear to have changed 
their outlook towards USG activities in the region and 
lobbied the FSLN's national leadership not to interfere with, 
or politicize, MCC activities.
