SUBJECT: URUGUAY UNENTHUSIASTIC ON RESETTLEMENT OF CUBAN 
AND HAITIAN MIGRANTS 
 
REF: STATE 78762

for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
(C) On May 22 and 24, PolCouns discussed reftel talking 
points concerning the need to resettle Cuban and Haitian 
migrants housed at the U.S. Naval Station in Guantanamo with 
the MFA's acting Director General for Political Affairs 
Alvaro Gallardo.  Gallardo said that while the GOU is 
generally sympathetic to humanitarian requests, consultations 
with his MFA colleagues on this subject revealed a uniformly 
negative reaction to the notion of accepting Guantanamo 
refugees.  He said his colleagues recalled an embarrassing 
1999 incident in which a half-dozen Cuban migrants had 
chained themselves in protest over being sent to Uruguay.  He 
added that his colleagues also asserted that Cuban and 
Haitian migrants were particularly problematic ""because they 
invariably sought to eventually emigrate to the U.S."" 
Gallardo offered to discuss the matter further at a lunch 
planned for May 30, but was clearly pessemistic about the 
prospects of settling Guantanamo-based Cubans or Haitians 
migrants in Uruguay.
