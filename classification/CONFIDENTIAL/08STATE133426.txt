REF: IIR 6 870 0006 04 OF MARCH 2002 
 
Classified By: David C. Trimble, for reasons 1.4(a), (b), and (d) 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 050137870 for the export of 
firearms to Nicaragua. Post is requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern check within 30 days. Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. (C) Reason for Request: Intelligence reporting (REFTEL) 
cites potential ties between Carlos Zamora, reported owner of 
end-user El Cazador, and retired Major General Roberto 
Calderon Meza, who has allegedly been involved with illicit 
arms deals in the region. This request is to establish the 
bona fides of El Cazador as a reliable recipient of the U.S. 
Munitions List items listed below. 
 
¶4. (U) Action Request: Post is requested to establish the 
bona fides of end-user El Cazador by working with relevant 
country team members and by making appropriate inquires to 
representatives of the company and authorities of the 
Government of Nicaragua. Post is specifically requested to 
determine if any of the parties are involved in illicit 
activity. In its reply, Post may also comment on any other 
information pertinent to this transaction such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
