SUBJECT: GOE YET TO TAKE POSITION ON JORDANIAN RED SEA 
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT REF: STATE 78652 Classified By: Classified by Economic-Political Minister-Counselor Dona ld A. Blome for reason 1.4 (b) and (d). (C) Per reftel, On July 28, Emboff met with Mohamed Nasr from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' environmental affairs and sustainable development office to learn about the GOE's views on the Jordanian Red Sea Development Project (JRSP). Nasr explained that the an official GOE delegation traveled to Jordan last week to learn more about the JRSP and his office is waiting for completion of a technical report about the trip. According to Nasr, the GOE has yet to take a position on JRSP (it is "too early to tell") and that the report would likely deal with concerns such as the project's environmental impact on marine life in the Gulf of Aqaba. He did not provide a date on when the report would be finished. We will follow up with his office to determine the GOE's stance on the project. Tueller
