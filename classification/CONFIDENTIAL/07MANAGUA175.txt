SUBJECT: PLC DEPUTIES FORM NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE WITH THE 
ALN, REFUSE TO DEFEND ALEMAN 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: A group of National Assembly deputies from 
the Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC) recently expressed a 
willingness to work with the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance 
(ALN) on legislative issues and reported they have formed a 
negotiating committee with the ALN.  The deputies, including 
the head of the PLC caucus, pledged that the party would 
never support "totalitarian" reforms that would benefit the 
Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN).  When we 
mentioned the presence of PLC leader and convicted 
ex-President Arnoldo Aleman, smiling and happy, at President 
Daniel Ortega's inauguration, the deputies declined to defend 
him, possibly suggesting a shift away from the controversial 
caudillo.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) DCM hosted a cocktail on January 17 with the following 
members of the PLC caucus in the National Assembly: Maximino 
Rodriguez (Matagalpa, head of PLC caucus); Jose Pallais 
(Leon); and Victor Manuel Duarte (RAAN).  (Comment: 
Rodriguez, himself new to the PLC leadership structure, was 
eager to meet with us and invited newly-elected PLC deputies 
Pallais and Duarte to the cocktail as well.  End Comment.) 
 
Seeking Rapprochement with the ALN

¶3. (C) Rodriguez, Pallais, and Duarte agreed that Ortega won 
the election because of "egos" and Liberal divisions, which 
"must be healed" before the 2008 municipal elections if the 
Liberals wish to continue as a viable political force in 
Nicaragua.  Rodriguez commented that the PLC has established 
a negotiating committee with the ALN to discuss legislation 
in the National Assembly and "build confidence" between the 
two parties.  The three committee members on the PLC side are 
Rodriguez, Pallais, and Porfirio Castro; the ALN members are 
ALN caucus head Maria Eugenia Sequeira, Alejandro Bolanos, 
and Eliseo Nunez, Sr.  Rodriguez requested that we intercede 
with the ALN to prevent an extension of the Framework Law 
(septel), which will prevent the National Assembly from 
gaining more control over the Executive.  DCM replied that we 
will encourage the ALN negotiators to continue their efforts 
to engage their PLC counterparts and seek common ground to 
the benefit of Nicaragua. 
 
¶4. (C) When we asked about the PLC position on FSLN-proposed 
reforms to Law 290, which would transfer more authority from 
the ministries and autonomous entities to the Presidency, 
they pledged that the PLC would never support "totalitarian" 
reforms.  (Comment: The same evening, DCM called ALN 
leader/former presidential candidate Eduardo Montealegre to 
encourage his party's engagement with this group of PLC 
lawmakers and PolCouns spoke with ALN caucus head Maria 
Eugenia Sequeira to the same effect.  Both were amenable to 
our suggestion and encouraged by the fact that we had met 
with the PLC deputies and that they had evinced interest in 
mending their differences with their ALN colleagues for the 
good of the country.  Montealegre and Sequeira indicated that 
they share the PLC's opposition to "fast-tracking" the FSLN's 
proposed revisions to Laws 290 and 228.  Nevertheless, the 
ALN differs with the PLC over extending the implementation of 
a number of constitutional reforms; the ALN believes the 
extension is necessary to dampen the influence of the 
FSLN-PLC pact, while Aleman seeks the implementation of these 
reforms on 20 January because they entail, inter alia, the 
establishment of regulatory agencies that the FSLN and PLC 
will staff with their cronies.  End Comment.) 
 
Countering the Sandinista Hold on Civil Society

¶5. (C) The PLC lawmakers voiced alarm over the Sandinista's 
efforts to expand their participation at the grass roots 
level and acknowledged that the Liberals are relatively 
inexperienced in this area and unable to compete.  Duarte 
commented that the FSLN is already organizing support 
committees in rural areas in the North Atlantic Autonomous 
Region (RAAN) to gain favor in traditional rural strongholds. 
 The ALN and PLC must resolve their differences and jointly 
rally to create socially-minded grass roots activities to 
counter the FSLN-directed "co-ops" he said are sprouting up 
throughout the area.  Duarte agreed that the creation of 
Venezuelan-style "citizen councils" (anticipated in the FSLN 
reforms) would only undermine the municipal governments and 
centralize decision-making under the President. 
 
¶6. (C) The deputies only laughed and refused to defend their 
"supreme leader" when we commented on Arnoldo Aleman's 
presence, smiling and hobnobbing with senior FSLN officials, 
at Ortega's inauguration.  They did not disagree with the 
statement that the PLC-FSLN political pact led by Aleman and 
Ortega has damaged the PLC.  Rodriguez commented that the 
party is not "the personal property of an individual." 
 
¶7. (C) Comment: The attitude of the PLC deputies signals a 
shift from pre-election meetings with similar groups, who 
would always hasten to defend Aleman and proclaim his 
innocence (at least in the presnce of others).  However, 
these more moderate leaders do not represent the hard core 
PLC militancy that remains loyal to Aleman -- at all apparent 
cost.  These new leaders may be able to move the party away 
from its hostage-like relationship with the FSLN and towards 
its natural ally, the ALN, but Ortega and Aleman, who have 
certainly caught wind of these efforts, will do their utmost 
to derail the rapprochement.  Indeed, on January 18, Sequeira 
told us that the PLC deputies, led by PLC vice president and 
Assembly deputy Wilfredo Navarro, who met with Ortega earlier 
in the evening, had apparently "betrayed" the PLC caucus' 
earlier decision to oppose fast-tracking deliberations on Law 
290, and instead, had offered to place the Law on the 
Assembly's agenda for the following morning.  Only the ALN's 
objection and the FSLN's willingness to compromise postponed 
the discussions until January 23 to allow for consultations, 
she reported.  We believe this incident demonstrates growing 
divisions within the PLC ranks.  We will continue to 
encourage confidence building measures between the two 
parties and a gradual rapprochement focused on common 
interests -- without the harmful influence of Aleman.
