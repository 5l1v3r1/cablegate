Classified By: CDA Peter M. Brennan for reason 1.4 (d). 
 
¶1. (C) On May 28, we delivered Ref A demarche to Alejandro 
Solano, the MFA's Deputy Director of Foreign Policy.  Solano 
told us the GOCR had had its own troubles with Brunson 
McKinley. The GOCR did not favor McKinley's candidacy due to 
McKinley's on-again, off-again organization of a regional IOM 
office in Costa Rica. Solano said once the GOCR had 
everything ready to go, McKinley changed his mind because of 
his "enchantment with Panama's Ciudad Saber" project (a 
complex of international governmental offices) and he moved 
the site to Panama. Solano also mentioned that McKinley's 
leadership has been sliding over the last couple of years. 
Solano seemed pleased by the news that McKinley did not enjoy 
support from the USG. 
 
¶2. (U) Solano also said that the MFA had communicated with 
the GOCR's Directorate of Immigration to solicit technical 
input for the MFA's decision criteria for the remaining 
candidates. 
 
¶3. (C) CDA raised issue with MFA Chief of Staff Antonio 
Alarcon and highlighted Ambassador Swing's credentials and 
background. Alarcon indicated that Ambassador Swing would be 
a good choice but did not commit immediately to supporting 
him. We will monitor and follow up.
