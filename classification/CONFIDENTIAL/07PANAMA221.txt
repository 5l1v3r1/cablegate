Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) "Panama wants to be a constructive and pragmatic 
partner of the U.S. on the UN Security Council," 1st VP and 
FM Samuel Lewis told visiting Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs (IO 
PDAS) James Warlick on February 5.  Mr. Warlick expressed 
appreciation for Panama's "pragmatism" and "seriousness" and 
noted that February and March promised to be busier months on 
the UNSC, providing a wealth of opportunities for continued 
close cooperation between the U.S. and Panama.  MFA UNSC 
Senior Advisor Nils Castro requested that the USG share with 
Panama its ideas and recommendations for improving the 
effectiveness of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, which 
Panama chairs.  In addition to meeting with Panama's Castro 
and his UNSC team, Mr. Warlick also had lunch with 1st VP and 
FM Lewis, Amb. Castro, and MFA Senior Advisor Adolfo Ahumada. 
 End summary. 
 
----- 
Burma 
----- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Mr. Warlick thanked Panama for its support for the 
UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) on Burma.  Even though 
this resolution was blocked by vetoes by China and Russia, 
Warlick noted that it sent a strong message to Burma, that 
ASEAN was more confident in its wake, and that this issue 
would return to the UNSC.  Amb. Castro underscored that the 
Burma problem persisted and that therefore the international 
community needed to sustain its pressure on Burma to change 
its ways.  Noting that the Southeast Asians were not 
convinced that Burma constituted a threat to "international 
peace and security," Amb. Castro said that the other UN 
bodies should be energized to advance social and economic 
development in Burma.  Reminding Amb. Castro that the UN 
Human Rights Council (UNHRC), the International Labor 
Organization (ILO), and the UN Special Envoy were engaged, 
Mr. Warlick noted that regional attitudes were changing 
regarding the threat posed by Burma's behavior. 
 
----- 
Haiti 
----- 
 
¶3.  (C) Mr. Warlick also thanked Panama for its work on Haiti 
to secure a roll-over UNSCR to re-authorize the MINUSTAH 
peacekeeping operation (PKO).  1st VP and FM Lewis and Amb. 
Castro separately stated that Panama was committed to 
continuing to work for a 12-month renewal of MINUSTAH's 
mandate.  1st VP and FM Lewis explained that he had spoken 
directly with Haitian President Preval urging him to make 
amends with China and to refrain from becoming enmeshed in 
China-Taiwan tensions.  Following consultations with Panama's 
neighbors -- particularly major Latin American MINUSTAH troop 
contributors Brazil, Argentina, Peru, and Chile -- 1st VP and 
FM Lewis said that he sent messages to both Taipei and 
Beijing that underscored the importance for the hemisphere of 
a successful MINUSTAH mission in Haiti, the necessity that 
this PKO continue, and the desirability of a 12 month 
roll-over. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Amb. Castro said it was "very important to make 
investments in institutional development" in order to "build 
sustainability" for the GOH.  Panama was looking to see if it 
could help build Panama's institutional capacity.  Amb. 
Castro explained that the GOP was considering providing 
assistance from its Comptroller General's Office, Public 
Registry, Ministry of Health, and water management authority. 
 Latin American troop contributors, while they understood the 
need to remain engaged in Haiti, also needed to be able to 
demonstrate Haiti's progress toward sustainability in order 
to justify their continued participation in MINUSTAH, Amb. 
Castro explained.  Additionally, Amb. Castro noted that a way 
need to be found to encourage educated and talented Haitian 
professionals to return to the Haiti. 
 
--------------------------- 
Counter-Terrorism Committee 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) Amb. Castro noted that Panama was honored to have 
been chosen to head the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). 
  Panama was actively consulting regarding the work of the 
CTC and hoped to play a useful role in improving this 
committee's effectiveness at help Member States improve their 
ability to fight terrorism.  Both 1st VP and FM Lewis and 
Amb. Castro requested that the U.S. share its ideas and 
proposals regarding the best way forward for the CTC. 
 
------------------ 
Kosovo and Georgia 
------------------ 
 
¶6.  (C) Noting that UNSYG Special Envoy for Kosovo Martti 
Ahtisaari was currently sharing his views and proposals with 
key stakeholders, Mr. Warlick noted that Kosovo would return 
to the UNSC in March for a new resolution that the U.S. would 
present.  Castro said that it would be "important to not talk 
about independence" in this UNSCR.  While acknowledging that 
Panama did not know much about Kosovo, Amb. Castro said, "We 
would face a sustainability issue" with respect to Kosovo and 
that Panama "would like to see an end to the period of 
fragmentation in the region."  Mr. Warlick noted that it 
would not mention "independence.  The goal was to present a 
resolution that would acceptable and that would avoid the 
possibility of a Russian veto.  Amb. Castro expressed his 
satisfaction at this approach. 
 
¶7.  (C) Turning to Georgia, both Amb. Castro and Mr. Warlick 
acknowledged that Russia would seek linkages between the 
Kosovo resolution and the UNOMIG roll-over UNSCR that would 
need to be completed by April.  Ideally, the U.S. would 
prefer to de-link the two resolutions.  Amb. Castro concurred 
that, as much as possible, the Kosovo and Georgia resolutions 
should be kept separate and said that the U.S. approach 
"sounded reasonable." 
 
 
---- 
Iran 
---- 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  Responding to Amb. Castro's inquiry about Iran, 
Mr. Warlick noted that the Council would receive its next 
report on Iran's nuclear program in February.  Depending on 
Iran's actions and the findings of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.S. would consider another 
resolution that would propose modest, consensus steps 
(including some additional targeted sanctions) and hopefully 
avoid a long, contentious debate.  Amb. Castro inquired if a 
way could be found through the EU-3 for informal U.S.-Iran 
talks.  Mr. Warlick responded that the U.S. was prepared to 
talk to Iran if Iran suspended enrichment and allowed 
verification.  "It's Iran's choice," Mr. Warlick explained. 
"Suspend, verify, talk," Amb. Castro echoed. 
 
-------------- 
Western Sahara 
-------------- 
¶9.  (SBU) Amb. Castro underscored Panama's long-term 
commitment to Western Sahara, with which Panama established 
relations in the 1970s. Noting that he did not "understand 
why this matter was so important to Morocco," Castro said 
that the Baker process offered the best prospect for a 
solution.  MINURSO's mandate renewal at the end of April 
would be the time to consider next steps. 
 
 
----------------- 
Somalia and Sudan 
----------------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU) First VP and FM Lewis and Amb. Castro underscored 
the need to respond to the humanitarian crises in Somalia and 
Africa.  Both supported Africa Union (AU) in its efforts in 
both areas. 
 
----------- 
Middle East 
---------- 
 
¶11.  (C) Warlick stressed the importance of UN Security 
Council and UN General Assembly actions on the Middle East 
that were balanced towards Israel and supported the work of 
the Quartet.  He noted the unhelpful actions of the Qataris 
and the need to work together with Panama in the Council to 
ensure to avoid unhelpful resolutions and presidential 
statements that did not further the interests of peace and 
security.  First VP and FM Lewis agreed that early 
consultations with the U.S. would be helpful. 
 
¶12.  (U) IO PDAS Warlick has cleared this message.
