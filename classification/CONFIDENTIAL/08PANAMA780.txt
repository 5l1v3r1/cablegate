Panama will recognize Kosovo in January 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (C) "Panama will recognize Kosovo.  We will recognize 
Kosovo after our term on the Security Council ends and before 
the new U.S. President is sworn in," 1st VP and FM Vice 
Samuel Lewis told Ambassador on September 30.  Lewis 
reiterated the he believed that Panama could be more helpful 
on Georgia if it did not recognize Kosovo now.  Ambassador 
noted that Panama had made numerous commitments to recognize 
Kosovo in the past, to which Lewis underscored Panama's 
commitment to recognize Kosovo in the first half of January.

Europeans Need to Lead on ICJ Referral 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) "It is too hard for small countries like Panama to go 
against ICJ referral," Lewis said.  "The Europeans need to 
carry the water on this issue.  The French seem more 
interested in oil deals with Russia and integrating Serbia 
into Europe.  If the Europeans are prepared to let ICJ 
referral go forward, Panama does not want to get in the way. 
What's Panama to do if the Euros don't get out in front on 
ICJ referral?" Lewis asked rhetorically.  Ambassador and 
POLCOUNS re-deployed Reftel talking points, to which Lewis 
underscored that the Europeans need lead on this issue.

¶3.  (C) Lewis' rationalization that it could be more helpful 
on Georgia if it did not recognize Kosovo is nonsense; 
Ambassador batted down this argument in her conversation with 
Lewis.  Lewis is aware, however, that Panama cannot continue 
to come up with excuses on Kosovo recognition and needs to 
act.  The commitment to recognize after Panama leaves the 
UNSC on December 31 and before the U.S. inauguration is the 
firmest commitment by Lewis to date to act on this matter. 
As for ICJ referral, whereas previously Lewis had suggested 
that his concerns were primarily legal, he has now clarified 
that they are primarily political, if tactical:  if the 
Europeans are prepared to let ICJ referral go forward, Panama 
should not get in the way.
