Classified By: AMBASSADOR CAROL A. RODLEY FOR REASONS 1.4 (B,D) 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  Late-morning negotiations between Thai and 
Cambodian military field commanders broke down and resulted 
in resumed fighting at about 1:55 p.m. on April 3, according 
to multiple Cambodian sources.   Council of Ministers 
Secretary of State Phay Siphan stated that Thai artillery 
opened up on Cambodian positions in the Eagle Field area near 
the Preah Vihear UNESCO World Heritage site after Cambodian 
troops were not withdrawn, as the local Thai commander had 
requested in morning talks.  Fighting lasted about 90 
minutes.  Post cannot confirm Cambodian casualties including 
early reports of two Cambodian troops dead.  The Ambassador 
contacted Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) commander in 
chief General Pol Saroeun late on April 3 to urge maximum 
restraint, continued dialogue, and disengagement of troops in 
the disputed Preah Vihear border area.  An uneasy cease-fire 
remains as Cambodians hold their positions.  Plans for 
bilateral Joint Boundary Commission (JBC) technical talks on 
April 6-7 in Siem Reap are still going forward according to 
the lead Cambodian negotiator.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Morning Clash After Surprise Encounter 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) A Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) source told 
Pol/Ec Chief that Cambodian troops entered the Eagle Field 
early on April 3 and were surprised to find armed Thai troops 
in an area of the disputed territory previously considered to 
be unoccupied.  Gen. Pol Saroeun told Ambassador that the 
incident began about 6:00 a.m. and that the Cambodians asked 
the Thai to leave.  When the Thai troops refused, the 
Cambodians tried to "force them out," at which point the Thai 
shot at Cambodian soldiers.  Gen. Pol Saroeun said that two 
Thai soldiers were killed in this morning clash. 
 
¶3.  (C) Council of Ministers Secretary of State Phay Siphan 
said that the two local commanders held talks later in the 
morning of April 3, but that at about 11:30 the Thai insisted 
that Cambodians holding the Eagle Field position be 
withdrawn.  The Cambodian commander left the talks and the 
troops remained in their positions. 
 
Afternoon Clash of Heavier Arms 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) At 1:55 p.m., Thai positions on the Phnom Trop 
(Eggplant Mountain) position overlooking the Eagle Field 
opened up with an 106 mm artillery barrage, followed by 60 mm 
mortar rounds, said Phay Siphan.  In another disputed 
location east of the Preah Vihear temple Thai troops used M79 
grenades, he said.  The two sides stopped fighting some time 
after 3:00 p.m., he said, noting that he received reports 
from sources on the ground.  Phay Siphan could not confirm 
Cambodian casualties, which open sources have put at between 
two and four dead. 
 
¶5. (C) MFA Asia One Deputy Director Hos Sereythonh noted that 
the Thai commenced the afternoon exchange of arms.  Late in 
the day, the MFA was still contemplating next steps, 
including calling in the Thai ambassador.  As of the morning, 
Prime Minister Hun Sen was still committed to traveling to 
the ASEAN 3 summit on April 10-12, an MFA source reported; 
however, he cautioned that the afternoon events could change 
the situation. 
 
Ambassador to Pol Saroeun: Show Maximum Restraint 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶6.  (C) The Ambassador called RCAF CINC Gen Pol Saroeun late 
in the day to emphasize the need for restraint on the 
Cambodian side, noting that the USG was engaging the Thai 
side with a similar message (Refs A, C).  Gen. Pol Saroeun 
took on board the message, stating that the fighting had 
ceased for now and that discussions between local commanders 
 
PHNOM PENH 00000224  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
were ongoing.  Gen. Pol Saroeun added, "We don't want to be 
fighting but maybe the Thai will force us into it 
(fighting)."  The Ambassador reiterated her message of 
restraint, adding that the talking should continue and that 
there should be a separation of forces. 
 
COMMENT: 
-------- 
 
¶7.  (C) The Eagle Field area has been relatively calm since 
the last clash of arms on October 15.  Since Thai troops on 
March 30 entered into an area hitherto left unoccupied, 
tensions have been escalating.  Both sides lay claim to the 
areas in which the troops are currently facing off and the 
diplomatic plan of action to address the issue is well 
developed, and could take another step forward in the planned 
talks in Siem Reap.  The greatest barrier to development of 
that diplomatic plan is the inability to remove troops 
entirely from the area in dispute.
