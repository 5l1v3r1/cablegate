SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT CLAIMS INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS ARE IN 
SANTA CRUZ 
 
REF: LA PAZ 572 
 
Classified By: APP/SC Debra Hevia for reason 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Early April 16, a Bolivian National Police 
(BNP) SWAT team raided the ExpoCruz fairgrounds in Santa 
Cruz, Bolivia, reportedly discovering arms and ammunition. 
Police also raided a downtown hotel, engaging in a firefight 
and ultimately killing three individuals (reportedly 
including one Hungarian/Romanian, one Irish national and a 
Bolivian) allegedly connected with the arms cache.  Two 
others are under arrest.  President Morales, on his arrival 
in Venezuela this morning, claimed that the GOB had been 
aware of the group for some time and that the group was 
linked to rightist foes of his administration.  (Note:  Last 
Sunday, President Morales alleged that rightist groups 
supported by the U.S. Embassy were plotting against him.) 
The Vice President alleged that the group had planned to 
assassinate President Morales, himself and Prefect Ruben 
Costas.  So far, aside from President Morales, comments last 
Saturday, the GOB has not alleged any USG involvement.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (U) In the pre-dawn hours of April 16, an elite police 
force flown in from La Paz mounted an operation against 
alleged international terrorists in Santa Cruz.  At five 
o'clock a.m., the BNP set off a sound device at the Hotel Las 
Americas, located in the city center.  The ensuing firefight 
resulted in three dead: press reports claim that the deceased 
were a Hungarian/Romanian national, an Irish national and a 
Bolivian.  Two others were arrested and transferred 
immediately to La Paz, and a sixth alleged terrorist escaped. 
 Some press reports linked this police operation to the 
pursuit of the individuals who placed a bomb at Cardinal 
Julio Terrazas' Santa Cruz residence the night of April 14. 
 
¶3. (C) Parallel to the BNP operation in the city center, the 
police raided the EXPOCRUZ fairgrounds, and claimed to have 
found a cache of weapons and ammunition hidden in the stand 
of telephone cooperative COTAS, one of the hallmark 
institutions of Santa Cruz.  Press reported that the BNP 
confiscated a shotgun, five rifles, a pistol, two bags of C-4 
explosives, a machine gun, and a molotov cocktail.  COTAS 
denied any knowledge of or responsibility for the arms. 
Embassy contacts who work at the fairgrounds, including the 
Expocruz organizers from the Chamber of Commerce, Industry, 
Services and Tourism (CAINCO), and the Agricultural Chamber 
of the East (CAO), told us that they had not been allowed to 
enter the grounds and could not confirm press reports. 
Embassy police contacts also could not confirm the 
information, as it is being closely held within the top 
levels of the Bolivian government. 
 
International Terrorists to Destabilize Bolivia? 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4. (U) In a press conference from Venezuela, President Evo 
Morales said the police had carried out the operation against 
a group of "international mercenaries" that were part of a 
plot to assassinate President Morales, Vice President Alvaro 
Garcia Linera, and Minister of the Presidency Ramon Quintana. 
 He claimed the Bolivian "right" was responsible. 
Vice-Minister of Government Marcos Farfan told press that the 
group was made up of international terrorists, who had been 
recruited to come to Bolivia, and that documents acquired by 
the government showed they had plans to attack Morales, 
Garcia Linera, and Santa Cruz Prefect Ruben Costas. 
(Comment: Why Costas would be a target is unclear as he is a 
 
vocal opponent of the regime.  End comment.)  When the press 
asked why the Santa Cruz local police and prosecutors had not 
been involved in the operation, Farfan said "We are 
investigating a very serious act...We have to clarify who 
contracted them, why they were hired, and who financed them." 
 
 
¶5. (U) Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera spoke to the press 
at mid-day and said that after the bombing of the Cardinal's 
residence, the government ordered a rapid investigation.  He 
confirmed that federal, rather than local, prosecutors would 
be pursuing the case, as it involved a highly-dangerous and 
heavily-armed group of Bolivians and foreign mercenaries. 
Morales had instructed that the operation be carried out 
before departing for Venezuela.  Not only were weapons and 
explosives found, Garcia Linera said, but also plans for 
future attacks, and the government had recently detected 
surveillance against high-level officials. 
 
Santa Cruz Prefect Out on a Limb 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) The police operations set off panic in Santa Cruz 
society.  Many Crucenos jumped to the conclusion that the 
weapons cache had been planted by the police in the COTAS 
stand at EXPOCRUZ, and that the government would use it as an 
excuse to take over COTAS and arrest the leaders of CAINCO 
and CAO (both groups represent vocal opposition to the 
Morales administration).  Some of the leaders reportedly went 
into hiding.  There were also rumors that the terrorists were 
Croatian, which could link them to former civic committee 
president Branko Marinkovic, of Croatian heritage.  In a 
press statement soon after the operations were made public, 
Prefect (Governor) Ruben Costas called them irregular, 
anomalous, and illegal, as they were organized in La Paz and 
excluded Santa Cruz police and prosecutors.  He claimed the 
government was mounting an accusation against COTAS, CAINCO, 
CAO, and EXPOCRUZ about a civic-prefect-oligarchy coup 
attempt, and called it a deplorable show.  In his own press 
conference, Garcia Linera insisted rumors that the government 
wanted to intervene in COTAS were false, and that the 
declarations of Costas were designed to obscure the truth. 
He called on the Prefect to collaborate in the investigation. 
 
President Previously Linked Paramilitary Groups and U.S. 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶7. (C) The government's assertion that there is an 
international terrorist group operating in Bolivia is 
worrisome.  Equally worrisome would be a possible attempt to 
link the alleged terrorists to the U.S. Embassy.  On April 
12, Morales said in a media interview, "I have information 
that there truly are paramilitaries in Bolivia, especially in 
Santa Cruz; we are not sleeping, we know how they are 
organizing themselves....Perhaps our days are numbered, 
because they are preparing themselves, and the Bolivian 
people should know that, if something happens to Evo, or 
Alvaro, or a minister, it is the work of the fascist right 
that is organizing with the support of the Embassy of the 
United States....What other plans might they have?  What else 
are the instruments of the empire preparing in Bolivia or in 
the world?" (reftel) Press reports on the events in Santa 
Cruz have reminded the public about the President's 
allegations just five days ago. We would not be at all 
surprised by a GOB attempt to link the U.S. Embassy to these 
recent violent events in Santa Cruz. 
 
Comment: Murky Facts, Many Conspiracy Theories 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶8. (C) In true Bolivian style, the conspiracy theories far 
outnumber the confirmed facts.  There was a bomb a the 
Cardinal's house, followed two days later by a police 
shoot-out that left three people dead.  The government seems 
to be setting up an accusation that a source inside Bolivia 
is recruiting and financing international terrorists to 
destabilize the country, and could well point a finger at the 
U.S.  Meanwhile, in Santa Cruz, people firmly believe the 
entire event was orchestrated and carried out by the 
government itself.
