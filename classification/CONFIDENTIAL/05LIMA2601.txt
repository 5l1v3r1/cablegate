Classified By: ACTING ECON COUNSELOR DAVID LIPPEATT, 
REASONS 1.4 B) AND D) 
 
¶1.  (SBU) At least five major Peruvian dailies, plus "The 
Economist," have speculated over the last week that the GOP 
will make a major push for the candidacy of a Peruvian to 
replace IDB President Enrique Iglesias, who announced his 
resignation May 31.  (Note: Iglesias will leave his post 
September 30.  End note).  Most press commentary has been 
highlighting ex-Prime Minister and current World Bank 
Vice-President Roberto Danino as the Peruvian nominee. 
Leading daily "El Comercio" reported June 8 that President 
Toledo is pushing Danino's candidacy and has instructed GOP 
officials to ensure that Danino's candidacy is well-managed, 
to avoid repetition of the failed effort to field a Peruvian 
candidate to head the OAS. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On June 9, however, influential business daily 
"Gestion" reported that Roberto Danino does not want the 
position, and quoted executive branch officials as saying 
that two countries in the region are pushing instead for 
Javier Silva Ruete, ex-Finance Minister and current IMF 
director for Peru, to be nominated.  In addition, daily "Peru 
21" said that President Toledo has not yet indicated he will 
support Danino for the position.  "Peru 21" quoted the 
President as saying that, "We will examine closely," the idea 
of nominating Danino for the IDB Presidency. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment.  The GOP was broadly criticized by Peru's 
press for mishandling the OAS Secretary General election by 
not pushing its own candidate, thereby seeing regional rival 
Chile scoop up the prize.  That perception will color how the 
GOP approaches the IDB election.  End comment.
