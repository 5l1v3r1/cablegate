Firm Response on Burma Needed 
----------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (C) "Panama supports full-heartedly a very firm response 
to the recent developments in Burma," MFA DG for 
International Political Affairs Javier Bonagas told POLCOUNS 
on October 2.  President Torrijos underscored Panama's 
dissatisfaction in his September 25 UNGA address by stating, 
"We condemn the violation of human rights in Myanmar and the 
continued detention of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San 
Suu Kyi," Bonagas reminded POLCOUNS.  "Panama will be with 
the U.S. on this one."  During the July visit to Panama by a 
Burmese VFM, Bonagas said that Panama underscored the need 
for Burma: to quickly move toward political dialogue, to stop 
playing games with the international community, and to move 
forward with democracy.  The Burmese left Panama very 
dissatisfied with the results of their diplomatic outreach 
effort, Bonagas asserted.  Noting that the current situation 
in Burma resonated in Panama given Panama's own experience 
with military dictatorship, Bonagas said that Panama would 
support stronger measures -- including sanctions -- against 
Burma.  Bonagas added that there was no question in Panama's 
mind that the situation in Burma constituted a threat to 
international peace and security.  Doubting that there would 
be any further direct contact with the Burmese regime, 
Bonagas concurred fully that the international community need 
to emphasis a unified and firm message.

Comment

¶2.  (C) In the wake of the September 1 election as President 
of the National Assembly of governing Revolutionary 
Democratic Party (PRD) Deputy Pedro Miguel Gonzalez who is 
under federal indictment on five counts in connection with 
the 1992 murder of U.S. serviceman Zak Hernandez and with the 
U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) under a cloud on 
the Hill in the wake of Gonzalez's election, Panama is eager 
to highlight that it remains a close friend and strategic 
partner of the U.S.  Furthermore, the PRD -- the party 
founded by military strongman Omar Torrijos (the current 
president's father ) and the party of dictator Manuel Noriega 
-- is eager not to seem to be giving the Burmese regime a 
pass for suppressing human rights and thwarting democracy. 
Predisposed to the U.S. position and having bilateral and 
domestic reasons to support the U.S. position, Panama should 
be a partner in efforts to bring pressure to bear on Burma in 
the UNSC.
