SUBJECT: IRELAND APPLAUDS AFGHANISTAN/PAKISTAN POLICY REVIEW 
 
REF: STATE 14097 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Section Chief Ted Pierce; 
Reasons: 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1.  (C) EMBOFFS delivered reftel demarche on February 18, 
2009 to Isolde Moylan, Director, Asia and Oceania Division, 
Department of Foreign Affairs.  Moylan indicated that Ireland 
is very receptive to the planned policy review and intends to 
provide views on the questions posed in reftel.  She 
recommended that the USG policy review group consult with 
Irish national Michael Semple, an independent advisor on 
Afghanistan to Foreign Minister Micheal Martin.  In a 
February 15 congratulatory letter to Secretary Clinton, the 
Foreign Minister expressed interest in discussing how Ireland 
and the U.S. could work together more closely in resolving 
international conflicts.  Greater Irish involvement in 
non-military objectives in Afghanistan ) perhaps even 
Operational Mentor and Liaison Teams (OMLTs) ) should be 
part of any future high-level discussions with the Irish. 
 
¶2.  (C) Moylan was very receptive to the planned policy 
review.  She highlighted Ireland's view that the 
international community's priorities in Afghanistan and FATA 
in Pakistan needed to extend beyond military intervention. 
Contributions to conflict resolution, humanitarian 
assistance, development, capacity building, and peacekeeping 
are all clearly needed, Moylan said.  (Note:  Ireland has 
committed seven troops to HQISAF through NATO's Partnership 
for Peace program.  Since 2005, Irish Aid has allocated over 
euro 16 million (USD 20.3 million) to Afghanistan in relief, 
recovery, and development assistance.  End note.)  At the 
same time, Moylan noted, the international community should 
seek realistic and achievable goals in Afghanistan, taking 
into account the cultures and history of the region.  She 
suggested that transplanting a Western-style government into 
Afghanistan was not realistic and that the international 
community should work with the traditional power structures 
of Afghanistan to achieve its goals ) including elements of 
the Taliban who are willing to defect from hard-core 
irreconcilable factions. 
 
¶3.  (C) Moylan expressed deep appreciation that President 
Obama was consulting with friends and allies, and that the 
USG was seeking Ireland's view.  She said she would discuss 
our demarche widely within the Irish Government in order to 
come up with a comprehensive response to the questions posed. 
 
 
¶4.  (C) Moylan referred to the expertise and work in 
Afghanistan of Irish national Michael Semple, who is an 
important independent advisor on Afghanistan to Minister for 
Foreign Affairs Micheal Martin.  According to Moylan, Semple 
has worked in Afghanistan for many years, speaks local 
languages fluently, and understands the country's complex 
tribal cultures.  (Note:  Semple, who was working for the EU 
at the time, was one of the western officials expelled by 
President Karzai in December 2007 for allegedly talking to 
the Taliban.  End note.)  Moylan recommend that the USG 
policy review group consult with Semple. 
 
¶5.  (C) Comment:  During numerous previous discussions with 
top Irish officials, they have made it clear that Ireland 
does not plan to increase its troop strength in Afghanistan. 
However, on February 15 Foreign Minister Martin wrote to 
Secretary Clinton congratulating her on being sworn in as 
Secretary of State.  In his letter he invited the Secretary 
to visit Ireland.  Among other things, he suggested, they 
could discuss &how we might work more closely in certain 
areas such as conflict resolution.8  Greater contribution to 
non-military objectives in Afghanistan ) perhaps even to 
Operational Mentor and Liaison Teams (OMLTs) ) should be 
part of any future high-level discussions with the Irish.
