TAGS: AORC KNNP IAEA PREL NZ
SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AMANO FOR 
IAEA DG 
 
REF: STATE 46302 
 
 
Classified By: Acting DCM Margaret B. McKean; Reason 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C)  On May 8, Acting DCM met with Jillian Dempster, 
Deputy Director of the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade (MFAT) International Security and 
Disarmament Division to discuss reftel points.  Dempster said 
that New Zealand will support Japanese candidate Ambassador 
Yukiya Amano in the next round of voting for IAEA Director 
General, and FM McCully has so informed the Japanese 
government.  Dempter noted that New Zealand will not lobby 
for Amano.  Dempster said that New Zealand believes that a 
non-European candidate is needed as DG, given the contentious 
issues facing the IAEA with respect to Iran, Syria, and the 
NAM states.  She was not certain if Amano would win in the 
next round of voting slated for June. 
 
¶2.  (C)  If there is need for a third vote, Dempster allowed 
that New Zealand would consider other candidates, but her 
government is not looking at another person as a possible 
consensus candidate.
