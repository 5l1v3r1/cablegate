CLASSIFIED BY: Joseph Kenny, Consul General, EXEC, DOS. 
REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 
¶1. (C) Key Points: 
 
------------------ 
 
-- King Abdullah met with more than 100 Shi'a leaders from 
Qatif, al-Ahsa, and Medina related to the sectarian clashes at 
Baqi'a cemetery (ref A). 
 
 
-- Following the meeting, the King announced the immediate 
release of all 38 detainees involved in the Medina incident. 
 
 
-- The Shi'a leadership considers the meeting to be a small 
victory that should calm frustrated Shi'a youth and ease 
tensions that have persisted since the Baqi'a incident. 
 
 
-- Shi'a contacts say the Islamic month of Rajab (June 24 - July 
22) will be a good indication of whether sectarian tensions have 
calmed, since Shi'a from all over the world make pilgrimages to 
Mecca and Medina during that month. 
 
 
¶2. (C) Comment: 
 
--------------- 
 
 
-- By meeting with such a high-profile delegation of Shi'a 
leaders, the King has sent a strong signal of his personal 
commitment to religious tolerance and desire to bring change and 
reform to Saudi Arabian society.  However, as the King makes 
progress, expectations among the Shi'a and other Saudis are 
likely to rise even higher.  This meeting with the King should 
go a long way in relieving sectarian tensions in the Kingdom for 
now, but the Shi'a will certainly continue to demand more rights. 
 
 
End key points and comment. 
 
¶3. (C) SHI'A LEADERS DELIVER MESSAGE TO KING.  Following the 
February 20 sectarian conflicts at Baqi'a cemetery in Medina 
(ref A), and the unrest that followed in Saudi Shi'a communities 
(refs B, C), a delegation of 109 Shi'a leaders led by Sheikh 
Abdullah al-Jeshi met with King Abdullah.  The delegation 
represented the Shi'a communities of al-Ahsa, Qatif, and Medina. 
 According to a prominent Shi'a leader, the delegation presented 
their concerns about Wahabbi extremists - including but not 
limited to the religious police - harassment of Shi'a based 
solely on religious beliefs and practices.  They also 
communicated their version of the incidents leading up to and 
following the conflict at the Baqi'a cemetery.  This meeting 
took place after the initial request to meet the King on Sunday, 
March 1 was denied (ref B).  The delegation consisted mainly of 
Shi'a sheikhs and other religious figures. 
 
¶4. (C) KING IMMEDIATELY RELEASES ALL DETAINEES.  Following the 
delegation's meeting with the King, he reportedly announced the 
immediate release of all 38 detainees from the Medina incident. 
Post has not confirmed whether all detainees have been 
physically released, but Shi'a contacts are certain that it will 
happen.  However, XXXXXXXXXXXX (protect), an elected municipal 
council member and prominent Shi'a leader, said that the 
delegation would have eventually secured the detainees' release 
separately from Prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud 
(MbN), Assistant Minister of Interior for Security Affairs, 
though he admitted that the King made it much easier and 
quicker. 
 
¶5. (C) JUSTICE IS LESS IMPORTANT.  The delegation also demanded 
a full, transparent and independent investigation into the 
incidents at Baqi'a.  However, XXXXXXXXXXXX does not expect the 
results of any investigation to be made public or any unlawful 
acts to be punished.  He said that MbN showed the delegation a 
video clip of the Baqi'a incident that had clearly been edited 
in an attempt to convince them that no wrongdoing was committed. 
 XXXXXXXXXXXX  believes that punishment is not important now in any 
case and that the meeting was a good "first step" to reducing 
sectarian tensions in Saudi Arabia and addressing Shi'a 
concerns. 
 
¶6. (C) TENSIONS HAVE COOLED DOWN...FOR NOW.  Most Shi'a sources 
believe that the mounting frustrations among the Shi'a youth 
will diminish after the meeting with the King and the release of 
the detainees.  However, they believe that more will need to be 
done beyond just clamping down on harassment by the religious 
police or expanding visiting hours at Baqi'a cemetery.  They 
believe that the SAG must make more public and bold gestures 
acknowledging the legitimacy of Shi'a Saudis as citizens of 
equal standing to their Sunni co-religionists.  According to a 
couple of Shi'a activists from Qatif, the Islamic month of Rajab 
(June 24 - July 22) will be a good test of whether the SAG has 
addressed the root causes of sectarian tensions.  During this 
month Shi'a from all over the world come to Mecca and Medina 
during summer holidays and will visit Baqi'a cemetery and other 
Shi'a holy sites.
