SUBJECT: COSTA RICA SUPPORTING LIBYAN UNSC SETTLEMENTS 
RESOLUTION 
 
REF: A. STATE 73171 
     ¶B. USUN 614 
     ¶C. SAN JOSE 129 
 
Classified By: POL/C David E. Henifin for reason 1.4(d). 
 
¶1. (SBU) We delivered Ref A on July 9 to Antonio Alarcon, 
FoMin Stagno's Chief of Staff, and to Juan Salas, MFA UNSC 
Desk Officer.  Alarcon told DCM Brennan they would review the 
issue carefully, and, based on our points, Alarcon did not 
think the GOCR would have a problem going along with the U.S. 
on this one.  However, PolOff spoke around the same 
time to Salas, who told us the GOCR was supporting the 
resolution, but wanted to confirm it was the Libyan version 
they were supporting. 
 
¶2. (SBU) After seeing Ref B, PolOff contacted Salas again on 
July 10 to confirm the GOCR's position, and was told by 
Salas that Costa Rica was/was supporting the Libyan version. 
Salas asked PolOff to send our points in writing 
so that he could inform others at the MFA.  As we were 
prohibited from leaving a non-paper by Ref A, we reiterated 
the points verbally.  Salas asked PolOff to follow up with 
UNSC Team Member Deyanira Ramirez, who is handling 
Middle East issues. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT:  We suspect that Costa Rica's newly-widened 
diplomatic ties to seven Arab nations and the "State" of 
Palestine (Ref C) may be fueling this rather odd MFA 
position.  Based on Alarcon's original comments and the MFA's 
request for our views, the door may still be open to bring 
Costa Rica around.  We assume USUN can do this more 
effectively, directly (and quickly) in New York.  If we can 
buttress those efforts here, please advise.
