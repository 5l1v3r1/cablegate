SUBJECT:  SECRETARY LEAVITT,S MEETING WITH HONDURAN 
PRESIDENT ZELAYA 
 
REF: TEGUCIGALPA 00076 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: On January 9, 2007 the U.S. Presidential 
Delegation (Presdel), led by Health and Human Services (HHS) 
Secretary Michael Leavitt, discussed with Honduran President 
Jose Manuel Zelaya a new regional health-care training 
initiative; Honduras' petroleum dependency; resolving the 
need for road-maintenance legislation for the Honduran 
Government's (GOH) Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) 
program; bilateral immigration concerns, including the GOH's 
desire for continued Temporary Protected Status (TPS); and 
the GOH's offer to serve as an intermediary between the U.S. 
and Cuban Governments.  President Zelaya expressed his 
Government's interest in the new health initiative and 
invited the Secretary to visit Honduras.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) President Zelaya opened the meeting by noting that 
Honduras' main problem is its reliance on petroleum, a 
"volatile, speculative commodity" subject to unpredictable 
price fluctuations.  He called for USG assistance in 
resolving Honduras' "difficulties" with U.S. oil companies 
that provide petroleum and its derivatives to Honduras. 
Citing Texaco and Shell (Foreign Minister Milton Jimenez 
Puerto interjected to note that Shell is a Dutch-Anglo 
consortium) as the primary petroleum refiners and retailers 
in Honduras, President Zelaya explained these companies have 
refused to consider the GOH's proposal to run a competitive 
tender to purchase oil products on the market instead of 
pegging them to exorbitant international rates (Reftel). 
 
¶3.  (C) President Zelaya alleged that Texaco and Shell, 
companies he claimed maintain an "oleopolio" in Honduras, 
have threatened to "cut their supplies" to Honduras if it 
does not comply with their terms.  He said this impasse could 
force the GOH to consider an offer from Venezuelan President 
Hugo Chavez to provide the indispensable resource under more 
attractive terms -- an option that would not be convenient 
for either the United States or Honduras, he warned. 
Assistant Secretary Shannon confirmed President Zelaya has 
raised these concerns twice with President Bush, as well as 
with U.S. Embassy officials in Tegucigalpa, and stated the 
USG is exploring ways to stabilize oil prices via the 
Meso-America Initiative of the Inter-American Development 
Bank. 
 
TPS and Other Immigration Concerns

¶4.  (SBU) President Zelaya then touched on U.S. immigration 
policy vis a vis Honduras, specifically the need for the 
extension of what he termed the "almost legalized immigration 
status" of some 80,000 Hondurans who participate in the U.S. 
Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program.  Assistant 
Secretary Shannon clarified that Honduras' access to TPS is 
set to expire in July 2007.  He assured President Zelaya he 
will convey these concerns to Washington decisionmakers. 
 
 
GOH Welcomes Health Initiative

¶5.  (SBU) Secretary Leavitt next outlined his vision for the 
new regional health initiative, whose centerpiece is a 
regional training facility in Panama to train hundreds of 
health workers, including nurses, medical technicians, and 
community health workers from the region.  Suggesting the 
center could train 150-300 health workers per year to start, 
the Secretary explained the program will focus on the 
training of service providers from rural areas.  President 
Zelaya congratulated the Secretary for the initiative and 
assured him he can "count on our cooperation."  The Secretary 
described the next steps in the program -- drafting a 
Memorandum of Understanding, visiting the participating 
countries, and possibly signing the agreement in a regional 
venue.  The Secretary clarified the health initiative arose 
from a meeting of Central American Ministers of Health in 
June 2006.  President Zelaya promised to follow up on the 
details with the Honduran Minister of Health and to work with 
Panamanian President Torrijos to ensure progress. 
 
Honduras Offers to Serve as Intermediary for U.S.-Cuba Talks

¶6.  (C) Remarking that Honduran Foreign Minister Jimenez 
Puerto had traveled to Cuba in December, President Zelaya 
suggested that Honduras, through its new Embassy in Havana, 
could help facilitate talks between U.S. and Cuban Government 
officials.  President Zelaya urged the United States to 
engage Raul Castro and other Cuban Government leaders before 
Fidel Castro's death as a means to positively influence the 
direction of Cuba's transition, and speculated the Cubans 
might show more flexibility now than after Fidel is gone. 
Assistant Secretary Shannon thanked President Zelaya for his 
interest and promised to convey his kind offer to Secretary 
Rice.  A/S Shannon added that talks are difficult during this 
uncertain period and that the USG seeks to help Cuba embark 
on a process towards democratic change.  Foreign Minister 
Jimenez explained that, given Honduras' extensive maritime 
borders with Cuba, the considerable presence of both pro and 
anti-Castro naturalized Cubans who now work for the Honduran 
Government, and long historical connections between the two 
countries, Honduras maintains particular interest in Cuba and 
will continue to engage Havana.  The Foreign Minister made a 
point of emphasizing these motives so that Washington would 
not misinterpret future Honduran dealings with the Cuban 
regime. 
 
Zelaya Promises to Resolve MCC Road Maintenance Concerns

¶7.  (C) Congratulating President Zelaya for his leadership in 
the MCA-Honduras program, Millennium Challenge Corporation 
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) John Danilovich urged Zelaya to 
use his leadership to resolve an outstanding matter involving 
road maintenance.  Ambassador Danilovich explained the MCC 
program in Honduras (MCA-H) had been flexible with the GOH, 
and it had not required the passage of a road-maintenance law 
before initiating the program.  (Note: Nicaragua established 
road-maintenance funding in its national budget before its 
Compact entered into force.)  However, to date, the Honduran 
Congress had still not passed the required legislation, and 
has not budgeted approximately USD 5 million of the total USD 
45 million required for road maintenance, said Ambassador 
Danilovich.  President Zelaya, who thanked Ambassador 
Danilovich for his clarification, commented that, although he 
knew of the GOH commitment to provide additional maintenance 
funds, he was unaware legislation is also required. 
President Zelaya assured Ambassador Danilovich that he will 
take prompt action on the matter.
