SUBJECT: PANAMANIAN AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES REGIONAL ISSUES 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Charles L. Glazer, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador Glazer met with Luis Enrique 
Torres, Panamanian Ambassador to El Salvador to exchange 
views on regional issues including foreign investment, 
elections, and public security. Ambassador Torres expressed 
his concern over possible violence in the upcoming 2009 
Salvadoran elections and expressed Panama's interest in 
helping to combat transnational crime. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On February 12, Ambassador Glazer received a courtesy 
call from Luis Enrique Torres Herrera, Panama's Ambassador to 
El Salvador. During their meeting the two Ambassadors 
exchanged views on public safety, foreign investment, and the 
upcoming Salvadoran national elections. 
 
¶3. (C) According to Torres, El Salvador remains relatively 
unattractive to foreign investment.  He argued that 
corruption in the judicial system and in the government at 
large must be addressed before foreign investors will have 
the required confidence to make significant investments in 
the country. 
 
¶4. (C) Torres was very concerned about 2009 Salvadoran 
elections and their possible aftermath. He fears the outbreak 
of violence from extremist elements on both ends of the 
political spectrum.  While he did not identify specific 
organizations or individuals, he clearly believes that 
radical political cells and even paramilitary organizations 
could incite violence and try to radicalize more moderate 
elements of civil society. 
 
¶5. (C) On the issue of public safety, Ambassador Torres 
maintained that Panama does not face the same problems of 
gang violence and organized crime that confront El Salvador 
and many other Central American countries.  He added, 
however, that Panama has an interest in "lending a hand" in 
the fight against organized crime in order to contain the 
problem and keep it from reaching Panama.  He was 
particularly interested in the programs hosted by the 
International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in El Salvador 
and asked how Panama could support ILEA and participate in 
its programs. (Note: Panamanian students have participated in 
ILEA training from the outset. End note.)  Torres said that 
Panama would like to help El Salvador and its other Central 
American neighbors, but emphasized that Panama will maintain 
a "hands off" approach and has no desire to intervene in the 
internal politics of other Central American nations. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: Ambassador Torres' interest in regional 
security is encouraging; we will look to build on his 
interest to encourage further support for regional security 
initiatives under the Merida initiative.  We plan to invite 
Torres to visit the ILEA facility in Santa Tecla and look for 
opportunities to continue engaging the Panamanian 
representative in a security dialogue. End Comment.
