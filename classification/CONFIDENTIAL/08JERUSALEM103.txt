SUBJECT: YESHA LEADER SAYS THERE WAS A DEAL ON OUTPOSTS, 
BUT PM OLMERT NIXED IT 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General Jake Walles, per reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  Yesha Council Chairman Dani Dayan told 
PolOff January 16 that the settlers had reached a ""limited 
deal"" with MOD Barak to evacuate ""a few outposts"" in exchange 
for continued issuance of construction permits in existing 
settlement population centers, but PM Olmert vetoed the deal. 
 Dayan said Olmert is ""paralyzed"" by USG pressure to evacuate 
outposts and halt settlement construction simultaneously, and 
the twin requirements leave him no room to negotiate.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
""Limited Deal"" Agreed 
between Settlers and Barak 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  Yesha Council Chairman Dani Dayan told PolOff 
January 16 that a ""limited deal"" was reached several weeks 
ago with MOD Barak to remove ""a few outposts,"" but PM Olmert 
later vetoed it.  According to Dayan, the deal was a 
""confidence building measure"" that would allow issuance of 
construction permits in settlement population centers in 
exchange for voluntary removal of sparsely populated 
outposts. 
 
¶3.  (C) Settlement movement founder and Kiryat Arba resident 
Elyakim Haetzni described the deal as follows: residents of 
""outposts on private land"" would voluntarily dismantle and 
evacuate their outposts and move ""to another nearby hilltop"" 
on land considered by the GOI to be state land, and the GOI 
would recognize the new outposts as legal.  Haetzni said PM 
Olmert rejected the deal that would have legalized the new 
outposts, because ""he committed to the U.S. not to 
compromise.""  According to Dayan, since Olmert's rejection, 
the settlers have taken this deal off the table.  He added 
that they are watching carefully the upcoming February 6 High 
Court of Justice hearing on Migron outpost. 
 
Dayan: GOI Paralyzed on Settlements 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C)  Dayan said Olmert is ""paralyzed"" by USG pressure to 
freeze settlement construction and evacuate outposts and has 
no room to negotiate with settlers.  The ""US requirement"" 
that Olmert freeze construction and evacuate outposts 
simultaneously leaves Olmert nothing to trade, according to 
Dayan, and that explains his veto of Barak's deal with the 
settlers.  Dayan added that the recent increase in Qassam 
rockets from Gaza prevents Olmert from ""bringing the army"" to 
forcibly evacuate outposts, which would mean ""civil war."" 
 
¶5.  (C)  Dayan said Olmert ""seems determined to follow 
through after Annapolis,"" but he believes ""something will 
give"" shortly.  He anticipates that the late January final 
Winograd report will be a ""political earthquake,"" Olmert's 
coalition will break up, and ""we'll have elections in 2008."" 
Dayan said settlers have greater political leverage than 
previously, with particular influence in the right wing 
parties. 
 
¶6. (C)  Dayan said he and settler advocate MK Otniel 
Schneller met Quartet Special Representative Tony Blair last 
week and asked to see the Secretary on her next visit.
