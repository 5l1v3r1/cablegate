SUBJECT: Supreme Court Turnover Consolidates Presidential Power 
 
REF: 09 PANAMA 907 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Stephenson, Ambassador; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1. (C) On January 4  the Supreme Court elected longtime member 
Anibal Salas as president and chose recent appointee and former 
drug prosecutor Jose Almengor as president of the court's criminal 
chamber. Salas won six votes for president, including those of 
Alberto Cigarruista and Winston Spadafora, his fellow appointees 
from the Moscoso administration.  Almengor, Alejandro Moncada, PRD 
appointee Victor Benavides and Salas himself joined Cigarruista and 
Spadafora in voting Salas in.  The three judges that post deems to 
be relatively uncorrupt, including previous court president Harley 
Mitchell, abstained from the vote. 
 
 
 
¶2. (C) The turnover drama was highlighted by Salas' appointment of 
Zaira de Latorraca as his chief staffer after the National Assembly 
rejected her last month as an alternate judge for Moncada (ref A). 
PRD Deputy Mickey Aleman, a close friend of Almengor's, told 
polcouns that after Latorraca was rejected, Almengor instructed her 
to sit tight, because she would be taken care of.  Aleman also 
related that an inebriated President Ricardo Martinelli was 
publicly overheard saying that he had made a big mistake by naming 
Alejandro Moncada.  It appears  that he may have chose Moncada out 
of spite towards the Panamenista Party members in the ruling 
coalition who had strenuously objected to Martinelli's  first 
choice, former PRD member and current Electoral Tribunal magistrate 
Gerardo Solis. 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) The following is an organization chart of the Supreme Court. 
There are four chambers, called "salas" in Spanish: 
 
 
 
Civil Court: 
 
Justice Alberto Cigarruista, President                    Appointed 
by former President Moscoso

Justice Harley Mitchell 
Appointed by former President Torrijos 
 
 
 
Penal Court: 
 
Justice JosC) Abel Almengor, President                  Appointed by 
current President Martinelli 
 
Justice JerC3nimo MejC-a 
Appointed by former President Torrijos 
 
Justice Anibal Salas 
Appointed by former President Moscoso 
 
 
 
Administrative Court: 
 
Justice Winston Spadafora, President                    Appointed 
by former President Moscoso 
 
Justice Alejandro Moncada Luna 
Appointed by current President Martinelli 
 
Justice Victor Benavides 
Appointed by former President Torrijos 
 
 
 
General Matters Court 
Composed of the Presidents of the other three courts. 
 
¶4. (U) The Supreme Court has nine magistrates, appointed to 
ten-year terms.  Every two years, two judges are replaced, 
staggering the tenure of the justices.  Salas has been a member of 
the court for eight years and will serve a two-year term as 
president, where his main authority rests with his ability to set 
the agenda for the weekly full plenary sessions of the court. 
Apart from the weekly plenaries, which are held to address cases 
with constitutional implications, the court is divided into four 
three-judge chambers, three of which hear cases according to type; 
civil, criminal, or administrative.  A fourth chamber is composed 
of the presidents of each of the first three and is dedicated to 
internal court matters and licensing for attorneys.  It is in these 
chambers that the bulk of the court's work occurs, hearing cases 
which have no bearing on constitutional law but which are not 
resolved by Panama's lower courts.  In addition to normal duties, 
the court retains two powers with wide ramifications for Panama's 
government; it has sole authority to remove and try legislators, 
and it controls appointments to the courts immediately underneath 
it.   These lower courts, in turn, control appointments beneath 
them, creating a cascade of judicial power from the top levels of 
government. 
 
 
 
¶6. Comment: President Martinelli now controls the executive, 
legislative and judicial branches of government, and civil society 
and the media are up in arms.  Septel will detail the latest 
developments in Martinelli's quest to rein in the Attorney 
General's office, the last remaining independent government 
institution.
