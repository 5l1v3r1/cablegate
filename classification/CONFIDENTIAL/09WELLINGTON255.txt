DERIVED FROM: Derived from previous message. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel points to Jillian Dempster, 
Deputy Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's 
International Security and Disarmament Division and urged GNZ to 
participate in the Information Exchange during the upcoming MTCR 
Plenary in Rio. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (C)  Dempster responded to our suggestion that GNZ consider a 
visa screening procedures presentation at the Information Exchange 
saying that she would need to consult with other offices such as 
Intelligence and Consular Services before determining whether this 
would be possible.  She will reply once internal coordination is 
complete.
