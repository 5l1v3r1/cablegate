TO DISAGREE 
 
REF: JERUSALEM 371 
 
Classified By: Consul General Jake Walles, per reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C)  Summary: Settler leaders Dani Dayan (Yesha Council 
Chairman), Shaul Goldstein (Gush Etzion Regional Council 
Chairman), and Elyakim Haetzni (co-founder of Kiryat Arba 
settlement) met with the Consul General in Jerusalem on 
December 11, again agreeing from the outset to disagree.  The 
settler leaders said recent settler violence reflects young 
settlers' disrespect for Israeli law and the influence of 
extremist rabbis.  None offered a concrete solution to the 
conflict, but all rejected the current process towards a two 
state solution.  End summary. 
 
SETTLER LEADERS REGRET RECENT VIOLENCE 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C)  The Consul General opened by condemning the recent 
settler violence over the past six months, especially the 
last few weeks in Hebron.  Yesha Council Chairman Dani Dayan 
said the settler violence is an outgrowth of the unilateral 
Israeli disengagement from Gazain 2005 and ""outrageous"" 
recent Israeli Supreme ourt rulings.  He said these GOI 
steps taught Isaeli youth that ""you can't play by the rules 
becuse the opponent will change them at the last minue; so 
why play by the rules?"" Dayan argued that dsengagement was a 
disaster for Israel, but he emhasized that the ""price tag 
policy"" is a mistakethat will not serve the interests of the 
settlemnt movement.  Dayan criticized the GOI evacuation f 
the Rajabi House, arguing that the operation was ""based on an 
outrageous court decision"" and that the situation could have 
been resolved in an alternative and legal manner consistent 
with court rulings.  Goldstein noted that settlers in the 
compound had evacuated non-violently but that outsider 
settlers engaged in violent activity following the operation. 
 
 
¶3.  (C)  Kiryat Arba co-founder Elyakim Haetzni said the GOI 
needs to stop pushing the settlers ""to the edge"" with 
settlement evacuations, noting that he has strongly, publicly 
condemned the violence, including desecration of mosques and 
gravestones, and encouraged all settler leaders to do the 
same.  He and Dayan said they are ""shamed and embarrassed"" at 
the level of violence.  Haetzni said the rabbis whom the 
settler youth follow should forbid attacks on Palestinians. 
 
SITUATION WITHOUT A SOLUTION 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C)  Asked by the Consul General how they propose to 
solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the settler leaders 
called it a ""situation without a solution"" and strongly 
rejected current efforts towards a two state solution. 
Goldstein said the Jewish and Palestinian national dreams are 
fundamentally incompatible and said he does not believe the 
Palestinians will be content with anything less than all the 
land west of the Jordan.  Dayan suggested focusing on 
economic partnerships and reviving the exchange of trade and 
labor between Israel and the West Bank. Haetzni said it is 
""not possible to solve the problem today,"" and advised that 
the U.S. administration ""should approach our problem with a 
little more respect for history.""  The Consul General 
responded that the picture they painted of a conflict that 
can not be resolved presents a bleak future full of 
continuing suffering for both Arabs and Jews.
