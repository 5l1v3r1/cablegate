¶1.  (C) Summary: Ecuadorian Minister of Defense Guadalupe 
Larriva, her 17-year-old daughter Claudia Avila Larriva, and 
five Ecuadorian Army officials were killed in a collision of 
two helicopters at 8:19 pm on January 24 in Manta, Manabi 
province.  While details on the exact cause of the collision 
remain murky, pilot error is likely to blame.  President 
Correa lamented the tragic accident and called for the 
formation of a full investigatory commission to include 
international participants.  Larriva's Socialist Party is 
demanding full inclusion in the investigation process, 
calling the accident "suspicious." CDA Jefferson Brown 
attended Larriva's January 25 state funeral in Quito, 
expressing U.S. sorrow over the tragic accident to GOE 
officials.  End Summary. 
 
Two Army Helicopters Collide 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to a Ministry of Defense press release, 
Larriva traveled to Puerto Viejo and Manta in Manabi province 
on January 24 to visit military units.  During her visit, 
Larriva observed an Ecuadorian Army Air Combat Unit live fire 
demonstration.  Following the event, Larriva and her daughter 
boarded the French made Gazelle helicopters to return to the 
Manta airport. There are unconfirmed reports that the pilots 
were taking advantage of the short flight to demonstrate to 
the Minister the capabilities of recently acquired Israeli 
night vision goggles.  At approximately 8:19 pm the two 
helicopters collided mid-air, killing Larriva, her daughter, 
and five Ecuadorian Army officials. The accident occurred 
nearby but outside the perimeter of the Eloy Alfaro Airbase, 
the site of the U.S. Forward Operation Location (FOL). 
Eyewitnesses interviewed by the media, seconded by a Manta 
FOL employee, report seeing the main rotor of one of the 
helicopters hit the tail rotor of the other as the two 
approached the Manta airport.  The Ministry of Defense 
communique announced the formation of a commission to 
investigate the cause of the accident.  Embassy military 
sources reported that the commission will be headed by the 
Ecuadorian Air Force. 
 
¶3.  (C) The Manta Forward Operating Location Fire Department 
was the first to respond to the crash, providing much needed 
technical assistance and logistical support to the Ecuadorian 
military and local first-responders.  CDA Brown phoned 
Ecuadorian Vice President Lenin Moreno on January 24 to offer 
USG condolences and technical support; the offer was repeated 
via the U.S. Milgroup to Air Force Service Chief General 
Gabela. 
 
President Correa Invokes Che 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) A visibly shaken President Correa rushed from 
Guayaquil to Manta late on January 24 and in remarks to the 
press lamented the tragic passing of MinDef Guadalupe 
Larriva, her daughter, and the Ecuadorian Army officials. 
Correa said that the accident site had been secured and that 
the GOE would seek international assistance with the 
investigation to ensure impartiality.  He told reporters that 
"we should continue moving forward, and that Guadalupe 
(Larriva) would not forgive us if we retreat out of fear." 
At the January 25 state funeral in Quito, Correa was clearly 
attuned to the large presence of Socialist Party activists in 
the crowd as he invoked Che Guevara and renewed his oath and 
determination to make sweeping reforms, declaring "always 
towards victory."  Preliminary indications are that the GOE 
has invited France, Chile and Brazil to form the 
international component of the official commission. 
 
Socialist Party Demands Answers 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Socialist Party President Gustavo Ayala on January 
24 called for an exhaustive investigation to determine the 
"real" facts of the collision.  Ayala advocated for his 
party's full inclusion in the investigation, and said that 
"Ecuador had lost a great woman with great political value." 
Other Socialist Party leaders suspect foul play, with some 
even suggesting that Larriva's "tough-stance" on the Manta 
FOL and foreign troops in Ecuador led to her death.  The 
Charge personally expressed the USG's condolences to 
Socialist Party leader Rafael Quintero (who had been rumored 
to become vice-minister), who graciously accepted the 
sentiments.  ForMin Espinosa's office also called the Embassy 
to convey her appreciation for the solidarity shown by the 
U.S. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (C) The fatal helicopter collision was likely caused by 
pilot error, as fuel shortages and funding constraints often 
hinder more extensive flight training.  Embassy sources also 
reported that the helicopter pilots were using night vision 
goggles provided by the Israeli government, who had warned 
against use before proper adjustments.  The accident's 
proximity to Manta FOL and the MinDef's recent press 
statements that the FOL agreement would not be renewed past 
2009 have invited inevitable speculation of U.S. involvement 
in the accident from the extreme left, but the more 
widespread conspiracy theories focus on the Ecuadorian 
military itself and perceptions that there was resistance to 
this first-ever civilian, female and leftist minister. 
Correa has given no indications of when he will name a 
replacement defense minister.  Correa had been firm in his 
commitment to name a female civilian to the post, which may 
mean turning to earlier rumored candidate Bertha Garcia.
