(U) Classified By: Political-Economic Counselor Katherine 
Hadda, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) On June 16, Poloff met with Craig Hawke, Director, 
Pacific Group, New Zealand's International Aid & Development 
Agency (NZAID) to discuss GNZ's official development 
assistance (ODA) and to explore opportunities for U.S.-New 
Zealand cooperation in the region.  Hawke said the Pacific is 
an "over-aided region, and that the last thing the Pacific 
needs is another aid project."  Rather, Hawke suggested, U.S. 
weight and influence would be more useful promoting policy 
dialogues.  "Australia and New Zealand are seen as 
neighbors," Hawke added, "and the U.S. can add its voice as 
an external, neutral party -- especially given its global 
perspective on governance and human rights." 
 
¶2. (SBU) When GNZ established NZAID as a semi-autonomous 
agency four years ago, Hawke said its two primary goals were 
elimination of poverty and a focus on development in on the 
Pacific.  New Zealand's ODA is centered substantially on 18 
countries, with 11 of those in Melanesia and Polynesia. 
NZAID is mainly pursuing programs to strengthen governance, 
achieve broader-based economic growth, and improve education 
and health. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In the last three years, GNZ has increased it ODA 
allocation to the Pacific by 50%, to NZD 173 million (USD 109 
million) as of the 2005/06 program year.  This Pacific 
allocation represents 55% of total ODA (up from 45% three 
years ago).  The primary target of increased spending are 
programs for income generation, rural livelihoods, investing 
in infrastructure for the poor, trade and economic 
cooperation, fisheries, and regulatory reform, Hawke said. 
 
¶4. (C) Hawke noted that NZAID's goals for the Pacific are 
largely consistent with those of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  However, Hawke noted that MFAT and 
NZAID had differing but complementary views on security 
objectives in that MFAT is focused on physical security (e.g. 
border management, port container security) and NZAID is more 
concerned with "human security" (e.g. socio-economic security 
concerns centering on conflict prevention, squatter 
settlements, natural resource management, environment 
management, and disaster mitigation and response).
