SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (C) President Uribe met with the heads of Colombia's 
highest courts following press revelations that Colombia's 
Department of Administrative Security (DAS) had conducted 
illegal surveillance and harassment of Supreme Court 
magistrates.  The press reported that the magistrates left 
the meeting encouraged that Uribe had heard their concerns 
seriously, but Supreme Court Criminal Chamber President Julio 
Socha publicly said the magistrates expect "actions, not 
declarations."  DAS director Felipe Munoz claimed that 
Prosecutor General Mario Iguaran had said there was no 
evidence linking presidential advisors to the surveillance, 
butIguaran later clarified that the Fiscalia investigation 
continues.  GOC officials continue to deny involvement, but 
we have heard from numerous sources that top Uribe advisors 
Bernardo Moreno and Jose ObdulioGaviria pushed the DAS to 
engage in domestic political spying. End Summary 

URIBE, COURTS MEET OVER DAS CHARGES 
---------------------------------- 
¶2. (C) President Uribe and Prosecutor General (Fiscal 
General) Mario Iguaran held a lengthy meeting on the evening 
of May 11, with the presidents of Colombia's four highest 
judicial bodies.  The meeting was aimed at addressing the 
judicial branch's concerns over allegations that the 
Department of Administrative Security (DAS) maintained an 
extensive illegal surveillance program against Supreme Court 
magistrates (ref A).  The surveillance allegedly included 
improper access to the sensitive financial information of the 
magistrates as well as members of their families.  Ivan 
Velasquez, the Supreme Court's lead auxiliary magistrate in 
theparapolitical investigations, told us in February that 
DAS's surveillance of him was so intense that it impeded his 
work, asserting it was meant to discourage witnesses from 
cooperating in the parapolitical investigations.  Uribe 
reportedly promised the magistrates that the surveillance and 
other harassment would not occur again. 

¶3. (U) Hernando Torres, President of the Superior Judicial 
Council, told the press after the meeting that Uribe and 
Iguaran were "worried" over the "serious" charges.  He noted 
that Uribe and Iguaran pledged to protect the personal and 
institutional security of the magistrates, and to respect 
magistrates' right to personal privacy.  Supreme Court 
President Augusto Ibanez called the meeting "productive," 
adding that it had opened the door to interbranch dialogue. 
Uribe also said he would meet separately with each judicial 
chamber to discuss the matter as the investigation of the DAS 
progresses.   Still, Supreme Court Criminal Chamber President 
Julio Socha, who did not attend the session, said the 
magistrates expect "actions, not declarations." 

COURTS CONCERNED AFTER URIBE BRUSHOFF 
------------------------------------- 
¶4. (U) The meeting came shortly after Uribe seemed to brush 
off a joint public letter from the judicial branch demanding 
a GOC response to the allegations against the DAS.  On May 4, 
the four judicial presidents--along with Deputy Fiscal 
General Guillermo Mendoza--issued a communique demanding a 
statement by Uribe on the matter, since the DAS reports to 
the President.  The letter also demanded that Uribe announce 
specific measures aimed at preventing a repeat of the illegal 
monitoring.  The GOC drew criticism for its initial response 
to the letter, which spoke of improving interbranch relations 
without mentioning the surveillance charges. 

NEXT UP: LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS, MORE INVESTIGATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
¶5. (U) The Senate's First Commission began hearings on the 
DAS scandal on May 12, with DAS director Felipe Munoz and 
Minister of Interior and Justice Fabio Valencia Cossio
scheduled to testify June 2.  The media reported that 
Valencia Cossio met on May 11 with Uribe-allied senators to 
plot a strategy to counter charges that the administration 

was involved in the DAS scandal.  Also on May 12, former DAS 
deputy counterintelligence chief Jorge Lagos--who resigned in 
the wake of the scandal (ref B)--testified at the Fiscalia. 

¶6. (C) Lagos's testimony could be crucial in determining who 
ordered the surveillance against the magistrates and other 
Colombian political figures. Mario Aranguren, head of the 
GOC's Financial Intelligence Unit, said publicly that Lagos 
was the one who had requested the magistrates' financial 
information.  Still, former DAS director Maria delPilar
Hurtado has denied ordering any surveillance of Court members 
during her tenure.  Uribe and his aides have also said they 
did not give the DAS such orders, but CNP Chief Oscar Naranjo
and former DAS Director Andres Penate have separately told us 
that former presidential advisor Jose ObdulioGaviria and 
Presidential Secretary Bernardo Moreno  had pushed DAS to spy 
on the GOC's domestic opponents.
