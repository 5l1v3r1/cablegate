SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON NICARAGUAN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS - 
GUATEMALAN RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 122262 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Counselor Drew G. Blakeney for reasons 1.4 (b&d 
). 
 
¶1.  (C) Pol/Econ Couns delivered reftel demarche Nov. 19 to 
Carlos Raul Morales, Director General for Bilateral Affairs 
of the Guatemalan MFA, and North America Desk Officer Sandra 
Jovel.  Morales said the GOG concurs with the USG's 
assessment of the situation in Nicaragua, and with the urgent 
need for a transparent vote recount.  He confided that 
Guatemala's ambassador to Nicaragua had requested the 
Guatemalan MFA's permission to observe the elections, but 
permission was denied due to irregularities in the GON's 
approach to international observation.  The widespread 
irregularities of the November 9 elections set a worrying 
precedent for the next round of presidential elections, which 
had the potential to be much more destabilizing, Morales 
opined. 
 
¶2.  (C) The GOG is deeply concerned by the most recent events 
in Nicaragua, Morales said, which were out of step with the 
last 18 years of regional progress toward democracy and 
stability.  Instability in any one Central American country 
would impact the others.  Morales agreed that a transparent 
recount would be of paramount importance, but the GOG would 
not join public calls for a recount.  Per Articles 6 and 12 
of the 1991 Tegucigalpa Protocol, the GOG would not publicly 
criticize the GON; rather, any potential criticisms could be 
raised at a SICA (Central American Integration System) 
Council of Foreign Ministers meeting. 
 
¶3.  (C) Comment:  Embassy does not anticipate that the GOG 
will take a leadership role in addressing the irregularities 
and outcomes of Nicaragua's November 9 elections. 
Nonetheless, the GOG's concerns about the potential regional 
impact are genuine.
