TITLE III OF THE LIBERTAD ACT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 48487 Classified By: COUNSELOR CATHERINE HILL-HERNDON REASONS: 1.4 (B) and (D)
1.(C) Egypt has relatively warm bilateral relations with Cuba. Per reftel, we are providing answers to the following questions: -- Has the host country, in Post's opinion, worked to promote the advancement of democracy and human rights in Cuba? Answer: With some exceptions (e.g. Sudan), the Egyptians do not include internal issues such as democracy and human rights as components of their bilateral relations with countries. An MFA contact told us recently that Egypt's approach to Cuba falls within this norm. -- Has the host country made public statements or undertaken other governmental actions, such as resolutions in the national assemblies condemning human rights abuses in Cuba; or actions in support of civil society through host country's diplomatic mission or other fora? Answer: Not to our knowledge. -- Have there been any high level diplomatic visits between Cuba and the host country in the past six months? Answer: Yes. Egyptian FM Aboul Gheit participated in the April 29 Non-Aligned Movement ministerial in Cuba, and met with Cuban President Raul Castro. According to media reports, Aboul Gheit expressed appreciation to Cuba's "wise" approach in carrying out its duties as NAM president over the past three years. (Note: Egypt will preside over the NAM beginning July 2009. End note.) -- What is the nature of investments that host country businesses have in Cuba? Answer: According to an MFA contact, trade and investment levels are modest, but in line with what would be expected between geographically disparate medium sized countries. Cuba's exports to Egypt appear to include tobacco and sugar; an Egyptian contact told us recently that Egypt has begun importing Cuban sugar. -- Are there any bilateral trade agreements or other cooperative agreements between host country and Cuba? Answer: Egypt and Cuba have an agreement whereby the two countries' nationals carrying diplomatic or special passports are exempted from entry visas to the other country. In 2007 Egypt and Cuba signed a protocol for economic and cultural cooperation. The protocol is meant to promote cooperation between the two countries in education, scientific research, energy, and information technology domains. -- Are there any exchange programs between the host country and Cuba, e.g. scholarship and/or medical travel to Cuba? Answer: Cuba and Egypt engage in agricultural technical exchanges to promote advancement of agriculture and agricultural education. Cuba and Egypt also engage in scientific and educational fellowships. SCOBEY
