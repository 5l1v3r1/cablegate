Classified By: DCM Christopher Henzel for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

(C) Pol/Econ Chief discussed the Paris Donors Conference with MFA Undersecretary Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa on December 10. Al-Khalifa re-confirmed the Foreign Minister's commitment to personally attend the conference. He agreed that it was critical to support President Abbas, including financially, but he did not know how much the GOB would be able to contribute. (Note: FM Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa said during the Annapolis Conference that he would attend the Paris meeting. End note.) ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI
