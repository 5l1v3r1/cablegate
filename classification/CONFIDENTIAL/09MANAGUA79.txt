Classified By: Amb. Robert J. Callahan for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On December 27 an angry Miskito Indian shot 
at Yatama party leader and North Atlantic Autonomous Region 
(RAAN) National Assembly Deputy Brooklyn Rivera during a 
campaign visit to Kuamwatla.  While Rivera's life was spared, 
the incident reveals the evaporating support he has among 
Miskito Indians in the RAAN upset by the political games and 
bad management of Yatama mayors in Waspam, Puerto Cabezas and 
Prinzapolka.  END SUMMARY

¶2. (C) During a campaign trip with Yatama Prinzapolka Mayor 
Candidate Lidia Coleman Bons to the Miskito Indian coastal 
community of Kuamwatla on December 27, a young Miskito 
attempted to shoot Yatama Leader Brooklyn Rivera.  Rivera, a 
National Assembly Deputy from the RAAN and long-time Miskito 
leader, is the architect behind the unpopular alliance betwen 
Yatama and the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). 
Instead of shooting Rivera, the young man shot his own mother 
in the leg, who got between Rivera and the young man, 
desperately trying to prevent the incident.  After the 
shooting, Rivera and Bons fled the area for their lives 
instead of holding the campaign event.  Community members 
later berated the wounded mother for interfering. 
 
¶3. (C) On January 8, Rivera traveled to the remote Miskito 
Indian community of Auya Pihni to hold an election meeting. 
His visit, coincidentally, came at the heels of a visit by 
EmbOff to the same community two hours earlier.  Rivera was 
poorly received by the assembled community members.  After 
being heckled by angry Miskito farmers, he was forced to end 
his meeting and flee the community.  Our contacts tell us 
that later that same day FSLN mayor candidate Guillermo 
Espinoza came to the same community and brought two pounds of 
pork for each family in order to garner support for FSLN 
candidates.

WHAT IT MEANS

¶4. (C) The Kuamwatla shooting incident and the failed Auya 
Pihni campaign meeting are the latest examples of the 
collapsing support Rivera has within the Yatama party.  He is 
held personally responsible by the Miskito Indian community 
for failing to advance their interests above his own. 
Community members feel especially betrayed by his political 
alliance with the Sandinistas, who were arch enemies of the 
Miskito people during the civil war / Contra period. 
Moreover, the Yatama-elected mayors in Waspam, Puerto Cabezas 
and Prinzapolka failed to bring the needed relief to the 
rural communities after the devastating Hurricane Felix. 
Instead, these same leaders have reportedly enriched 
themselves by stealing from the international aid, such as 
allowing construction materials to be transported to Managua 
to be resold at market prices.  Locals complain that they are 
ignored by Rivera until elections roll around. 
 
¶5. (C) COMMENT: Rivera, a former Contra leader, is in the midst of a serious personal political crisis. It seems that his bad behaviors and Machiavellian maneuvers to control the Yatama party are catching up to him and his political base is rebelling. There are parts of the RAAN where he is clearly not welcome, and even some where he is under threat of death if he shows up. The roadblocks in the RAAN (Septel) may be his last opportunity to salvage some kind of political support from the FSLN to survive the growing storm. END COMMENT
