¶1. (C) Summary: New MRS presidential candidate Edmundo 
Jarquin assured Ambassador that he will continue deceased 
candidate Herty Lewites' strategy of pursuing "responsible" 
social and economic policies and a productive relationship 
with the USG.  Jarquin admitted that he struggles with name 
recognition relative to the other candidates, but predicted 
that he will rise in the polls after the launch of a new 
publicity campaign.  He stated that Nicaragua has been held 
back by the PLC-FSLN political pact, but that President 
Bolanos will leave Nicaragua in good macroeconomic health. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Ambassador and poloffs met with new MRS presidential 
candidate Edmundo Jarquin and senior advisor Victor Hugo 
Tinoco on July 14 to discuss the death of former candidate 
Herty Lewites (reftel) and MRS' election strategy.  Jarquin 
stated that the MRS represents the "responsible left" in 
Nicaragua and will promote economic and social policies that 
benefit Nicaragua, noting that the policies of extreme left- 
and right-wing governments have failed in Latin America.  The 
MRS will also pursue a productive relationship with the USG. 
(Note: Ambassador mentioned recent press interviews with MRS 
vice presidential candidate Carlos Mejia Godoy, in which 
Mejia Godoy stood by the refrain he wrote for the FSLN party 
anthem that refers to the U.S. as the "enemy of humanity." 
Ambassador suggested that Jarquin could speak with Mejia 
Godoy about a more nuanced response.  Jarquin responded that 
he "understood."  End Note.) 
 
¶3. (C) Jarquin was generally positive regarding the MRS' 
chances in the upcoming national elections, but did admit 
that he struggles with name recognition relative to the other 
candidates, and that his party has the smallest financial 
resources.  He confirmed that the MRS will focus its 
resources in certain geographic areas where it draws the most 
support.  (Comment: Jarquin was not specific, but Lewites had 
the highest poll numbers in Managua and other departments in 
the central Pacific region.  Likewise, MRS contacts in Rivas, 
Matagalpa, Boaco, and Jinotega have complained of being 
starved of funds from the national campaign.  End Comment.) 
 
¶4. (C) Jarquin is confident that an MRS media campaign 
highlighting Lewites' legacy with the party will improve his 
poll numbers.  (The latest MRS ad features Jarquin and Mejia 
Godoy leading a candlelight vigil in honor of Lewites and 
promising they will continue his legacy.)  He also noted 
considerable progress in the IRI-sponsored training of MRS 
party poll watchers (fiscales).  Jarquin and Tinoco commented 
that 30 percent of self-identified Sandinistas support the 
MRS, plus a considerable number of independent voters that 
"want change." 
 
¶5. (C) Jarquin agreed with the Ambassador that Nicaragua has 
considerable potential for growth as long as the country does 
not "take a step backward" after the elections.  He opined 
that, unlike his predecessors, President Bolanos will leave 
Nicaragua in good macroeconomic health and (referring to 
Bolanos' low approval rating) "history will judge him 
differently."  Jarquin emphasized the need for Nicaragua to 
enjoy an independent and professional judiciary, unlike the 
pact-controlled politicized institution that currently exists. 
 
¶6. (C) Comment: Jarquin is an affable and erudite technocrat 
with many years of experience in international institutions. 
He admitted that his many years spent outside of Nicaragua 
have cost him in terms of recognition and credibility, but 
believes that the public will ultimately support him as an 
anti-pact, moderately left-wing alternative to FSLN candidate 
Daniel Ortega.  Jarquin does not project the folksy charisma 
that made Lewites so popular, but his running mate, legendary 
revolutionary songwriter (and womanizer) Carlos Mejia Godoy 
could compensate by balancing the MRS ticket.
