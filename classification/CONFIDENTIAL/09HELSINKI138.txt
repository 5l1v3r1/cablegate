Classified By: Polchief Scott A. Brandon for reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
 
¶1. (C) Polchief met with Johan Schalin, MFA Director for Asia 
and Oceania, on April 8 to discuss specific contributions to 
Afghanistan (REF A) and Finland's participation in the April 
17 Pakistan donors' conference (REF B). Schalin began by 
stressing that the Administration's white paper (REF C) 
received a very positive reaction within the Finnish 
Government (GOF), and stating that Afghanistan was his top 
priority.  He said that the Administration's requests for 
contributions for Afghanistan and Pakistan come at an 
opportune time, as the Foreign Ministry is commencing its 
internal consultations regarding the next budget and will 
consider what more Finland can contribute. (NOTE: Schalin 
added that the Finance Ministry will take up budget questions 
this summer, and the budget will go the Parliament in 
December. END NOTE.)  Regarding contributions for either 
country in the short term, Schalin said he could offer no 
good news.  He said all requests would be considered 
"sincerely, within budget constraints." 
 
¶2. (C) Schalin said that Finland would not announce any 
donations at the Pakistan conference.  He said that Pakistan 
was the "odd man out" in terms of Finnish development policy, 
and that given how the government structured development 
assistance there was no money to reprogram and direct to 
Pakistan.  (NOTE: Schalin said that through the International 
Red Cross Finland has provided support - financial 
assistance, civilians and equipment - for a field hospital in 
Pakistan.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶3. (C) The lack of a contribution for Pakistan, coupled with 
the fact that it has not been a recipient of significant 
prior assistance, might explain the composition of the 
Finnish delegation to the conference.  The GOF will send 
Schalin's deputy, Rauli Suikkanen, to the conference. 
Schalin said their participation was at a "lowish" level, but 
he added that Suikkanen's presence would be important for a 
future review of assistance for Pakistan, as Suikkanen's 
portfolio includes assistance. 
 
¶4. (C) Regarding Afghanistan, Schalin pointed to the GOF's 
prior decision to increase its military, civilian and 
development assistance.  That includes the temporary addition 
of 100 troops to support security arrangements for the 
elections; a plan to increase OMLT trainers; a planned 
doubling of police trainers to the EUPOL mission to 
approximately 18-20 by summer; 500,000 euros to UNDP for 
election support; and an increase in overall development 
assistance by one million euros annually from 2009-2013, 
bringing assistance up to 16 million euros by 2013.  Schalin 
said Finland would not provide additional contributions in 
the short term.  He said they would examine the specific 
requests directed at Finland, including for civilian and 
technical experts to build capacity in Afghan institutions. 
Regarding the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, Schalin 
said that Finland currently provides over half of the 10 
million USD requested, and said that under current 
projections their contribution would eventually approach 10 
million USD.
