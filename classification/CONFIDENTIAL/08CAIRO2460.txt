SUBJECT: ARAB LEAGUE TOYING WITH IDEA OF A JOINT ARAB FORCE 
 
Classified By: Minister Counselor for Economic and Political Affairs 
William R. Stewart for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Zeid al-Sabban, Advisor to the Arab League (AL) SYG, 
told us on December 1 that the AL is thinking about creating 
a ""joint Arab force,"" which could be deployed in places of 
conflict similar to United Nations and African Union forces. 
He said that this idea arose after the December 20 conference 
on piracy hosted by the Egyptian MFA.  Al Sabban said the 
only concrete idea proposed at the conference was the AL 
suggestion for an Arab maritime force to counter piracy in 
the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.  He contended that an Arab 
force is appropriate because the Arab countries of Egypt, 
Saudi Arabia, and Yemen are the most affected by the piracy 
issue.  Al Sabban added that such an AL maritime force would 
work in cooperation with the NATO, EU, Russian and Indian 
navies already deployed to the region. 
 
¶2. (C) In an effort to address the historical concerns 
surrounding a joint Arab force, Al Sabban said that this idea 
was not a ""revision of 1948.""  He said the force would be set 
up to cooperate with other multi-lateral forces such as NATO 
and the EU. Al Sabban added that today there are ""many"" Arab 
countries that are ""in effect"" at peace with Israel, and he 
dispelled the notion that a joint Arab force would have any 
role to play in the issue of Palestine. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment: This is the first that we have heard about a 
joint Arab force.  The AL is probably toying with the idea, 
but our conversations with the Government of Egypt, and the 
Arab League's lack of experience in this realm, lead us to 
believe that it would be difficult to garner support for such 
a pan-Arab force.
