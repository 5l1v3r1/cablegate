Classified By: AMB James C. Cason; Reasons 1.4(b),(d) 
 
 ¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  The National Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD) 
seized the largest cocaine transshipmentin Paraguayan history 
in Pedro Juan Caballero (PJC), during a joint intelligence 
operation between the Brazilian federal police, DEA, and 
SENAD.  SENAD confiscated 450 kg of cocaine and arrested six 
individuals June 18 (three of whom work for the National 
Police).  The success of the operation was due in large part 
to the recently constructed INL and DEA-funded SENAD facility 
in PJC. END SUMMARY. 
 
DRUGS,THUGS AND BAD COPS 
 
¶2. (SBU) SENAD seized 450 kg of cocaine that was en route to 
Brazil via land transport for distribution to other 
countries.  SENAD apprehended six individuals and seized 
three vehicles.  Lieutenant Nelson Ramon Sanchez Lopez and 
Sergeant Benito Ataia Chamorro of the National Police were 
arrested along with Edgar Salvador Carballo Ramirez, a 
civilian police administrator.  All three occupied the escort 
vehicle while three others, Jorge Ramon Pena Ferreira, Victor 
Hugo Dos Santos Gonzales and Joao Carlos Vidal (a Brazilian 
national) manned the two vehicles that transported the drugs. 
 SENAD also confiscated cash in various currencies (US 
dollars, Reales, and Guarani), radios and police firearms. 
 
ACTIONABLE INTEL 
 
¶3. (C) The success of the operation was due in large part to 
the combined efforts of SENAD, DEA, Brazilian federal police, 
and the Paraguayan Navy.  SENAD Director of Operations Luis 
Rojas explained that at the time of the operation an Air 
Force helicopter was out of service and the drug traffickers 
were aware of that fact.  SENAD obtained a second helicopter 
(from the Paraguayan Navy) for operational support and 
executed a successful mission seizing a cocaine shipment with 
an estimated value between USD 1 to 3 million (value varies 
depending upon regional market values). 
 
US DOLLARS AT WORK 
 
¶4.  (C) INL program assistance to SENAD that funded the 
regional operation facility provided SENAD with the necessary 
support to combat transnational drug trafficking in the 
narco-capital of PJC.  Rojas said the new base "supplied 
SENAD with the ability to prepare and execute a successful 
covert operation."  The base also provided them with a secure 
area to inventory and detain both the drugs and the 
miscreants involved.  SENAD now has improved infrastructure 
and air-land capabilities in the surrounding area. 
 
A FEW GOOD MEN 
 
¶5. (C) The success of the operation ultimately came down to 
the hard work, creativity, experience and guts of the agents 
involved.  In spite of the lack of proper communication 
equipment and vehicles, the agents were capable of utilizing 
their limited resources to pull off the most successful drug 
bust in Paraguay,s history.  (NOTE: SENAD borrowed vehicles 
and some communications equipment from the Brazilian federal 
police.  They also relied heavily on personal cellular 
telephones to coordinate during the operation. END NOTE.) 
 
COMMENTS 
 
¶6. (C) The tremendous success of SENAD operations in the past 
year (and in this case) is a clear indication that SENAD is 
the most effective law enforcement agency in the country. 
The SENAD leadership and their operational agents have 
demonstrated their focus in dismantling the transnational 
criminal organizations that have long operated with impunity 
in Paraguay.  INL and DEA assistance programs play a huge 
role in SENAD's success.  We expect our continued close 
cooperation with SENAD will contribute to even more 
significant results in the future.  We are already seeing a 
return on our investment in the PJC facility.
