¶1. (C) Summary - As a result of the October 31 Dutch Court 
decision that returned control of Yukos Finance (YF) to the 
Khodorkovsky-appointed directors Dave Godfrey and Bruce 
Misamore, YF and Slovak government officials have restarted 
negotiations that were halted in 2006. The court decision 
will certainly be contested by Monte Valle, the American-led 
investment group that purchased the stake from Yukos Oil in a 
Moscow auction in August, but even the Slovak Government now 
recognizes that the situation has again shifted and Godfrey 
and Misamore are once again the recognized representatives of 
YF.  The November 20 meeting between Economy Minister Lubomir 
Jahnatek and YF representatives did not achieve the aim of 
rebuilding goodwill and kickstarting more detailed 
negotiations. Each side left frustrated, feeling that the 
other was inflexible in its position and unwilling to engage 
in a constructive dialogue.  The GOS knows that it will 
regain management control whether it buys back the stake or 
if it is sold in an auction, but the buyback remains the 
least risky option and would finally give the government the 
control it has sought for the last 16 months.  End Summary. 
 
KHODORKOVSKY-APPOINTED DIRECTORS REGAIN CONTROL OF YUKOS 
FINANCE 
---------------------------------

¶2. (U) In a much-anticipated October 31 court decision, the 
District Court of Amsterdam returned control of YF to the 
Khodorkovsky-appointed directors Godfrey and Misamore.  The 
successful appeal overturned an August 11, 2006, decision 
that had given the Russian court-appointed Yukos receiver 
Eduard Rebgun control of Yukos Finance.  The Amsterdam court 
ruled that the Russian bankruptcy order that had appointed 
Rebgun as the bankruptcy trustee was not in accordance with 
Dutch principles of due process, and thus cannot be 
recognized.  All actions taken on behalf of Yukos Finance by 
Rebgun, including the appointment of Shmelkov and Hogerbrugge 
as directors, were deemed null and void by the 10/31 
decision. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The sale of the 49 percent stake in the Transpetrol 
pipeline has been held up since the August 2006 decision over 
competing claims to the asset by Godfrey and Misamore, who 
maintained control of the YF daughter company Yukos 
International (YI), and Rebgun.  After the positive court 
decision, Godfrey and Misamore are moving quickly to regain 
control of YF and to lay the groundwork for an eventual sale. 
 As a first step they need to get themselves re-appointed as 
the official directors of the company and have their names 
put back on the Dutch Commercial Registry, which is the 
official document that the Slovak Government refers to in 
determining who can represent YF's shareholders' rights at 
Transpetrol shareholders' meetings.  Godfrey and Misamore 
have appealed to the court for this to happen and expect the 
issue to be resolved by the end of December, according to 
local YF representative Jan Kridla.
