(U) Classified by: Political-Economic Counselor Katherine B. 
Hadda.  Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Post's defense attache on October 28 delivered the ref 
C demarche -- encouraging New Zealand's contribution to the 
NATO relief effort in Pakistan -- to Air Vice-Marshal David 
Bamfield, vice chief of the New Zealand Defense Force (ref 
A).  In a letter dated November 2, Air Marshal Bruce 
Ferguson, chief of the New Zealand Defense Force, responded 
that New Zealand would be unable to provide a military 
contribution to the operations in Pakistan due to limited 
resources.  The letter noted that the government was 
contributing in other ways, having pledged NZ $1.5 million 
(US $1.05 million) to be spent on shelter, medicines and 
other essential supplies (ref A). 
 
¶2. (C) The letter also said, "New Zealand shares the concerns 
of the United States and NATO in the wake of the enormous 
destruction and suffering caused by this disaster. ... New 
Zealand recognises the substantial contribution the United 
States is making to the relief effort.  The United States is 
always among the first to step up to help in these situations 
and your country's efforts in this relief effort are truly 
commendable."
