SUBJECT: JAMAICA: TRAFIGURA SCANDAL MAY AFFECT TIMING OF 
GENERAL ELECTIONS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Brenda LaGrange Johnson for reasons 1.4 (b) a 
nd (d). 
 
¶1. (C) The Trafigura scandal delineated septel has forced the 
resignation of Colin Campbell, Minister of Information and 
Development and PNP General Secretary, and may cause the 
Prime Minister to wait to call elections until late next 
year.  Prior to this latest imbroglio, many observers had 
speculated that Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller (PSM) of 
the ruling People's National Party (PNP) would call elections 
as early as this fall.  However, given the political fall-out 
from the scandal and the resignation of Campbell, one of her 
closest and most powerful advisors, PSM may decide to hold 
off on calling elections in hopes the scandal will blow over. 
 
 
¶2. (C) At his request, on October 10 Emboffs met with James 
Robertson, an influential figure within the Opposition 
Jamaica Labor Party (JLP) and Member of Parliament for St. 
Thomas Western, to discuss the scandal.  According to 
Robertson, such scandals tend to be forgotten quickly in 
Jamaica, and the public is very forgiving when it comes to 
corruption.  He said he is worried that, because of the 
imbroglio, PSM will wait until next year to call elections; 
unlike the PNP, the JLP does not have sufficient funding to 
maintain its current campaign efforts until late 2007. 
Robertson speculated that if the Trafigura scandal explodes, 
incriminating much of the PNP's leadership, PSM may be forced 
to resign and call snap elections to replace the entire 
government. 
 
¶3. (C) Robertson also mentioned the JLP motion of no 
confidence in the government that was tabled in Parliament 
that same day.  According to Robertson, the motion is 
unlikely to pass when it goes to vote on October 17; however, 
Robertson stated it was important to get PNP Members of 
Parliament on the record supporting a government that is 
"unethical" and "criminal." 
 
¶4. (C) Robertson also stated that the JLP would pursue the 
affair vigorously and would follow the trail wherever it 
led-- and this could include PSM.  Robertson noted that four 
senior GOJ officials recently had met with executives from 
Trafigura in New York, and was curious as to whether PSM had 
been among them.  (Note: on Oct. 11, PSM publicly admitted 
that she had been present at this meeting, but claimed to 
have known nothing of any transfer of funds.  End Note.) 
However, Robertson observed, the JLP is hesitant to pursue 
PSM too vigorously, since she is loved by the Jamaican 
people, even if not within her own divided party.  Robertson 
went so far as to describe PSM as more popular with the 
people than any previous Jamaican prime ministers, including 
Michael Manley and P.J. Patterson. 
 
¶5. (C) Robertson made it quite clear that the "playing field 
is not level", contending that viable democracy is under 
threat in Jamaica as a result of outside influence.  He 
pointed out that Petro Caribe funds are under no 
Parliamentary oversight or scrutiny, and that they will be 
used to maintain the political status quo (comment: echoing 
concerns expressed by JLP MP Audley Shaw to EconOff). 
 
¶6. (C) Comment.  At least for the moment, Robertson's 
speculation that the Trafigura scandal could explode, leading 
to a collapse of Government and snap elections, still looks 
unlikely.  It seems more probable that PSM will wait to call 
elections in hopes the scandal will be forgotten-- like so 
many previous imbroglios in Jamaica.  Robertson was clearly 
angling for USG support, although he acknowledged that the 
Embassy could not afford to be seen as anything other than 
neutral.  End Comment.
