SUBJECT: NICARAGUA'S HEALTH MINISTER SAYS ABORTION LAW 
PASSED WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR CONSEQUENCES 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Brennan for reasons 1.4(b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  Poloffs recently met with Nicaraguan 
Minister of Health Margarita Gurdian to solicit her position 
on Nicaragua's new legislation criminalizing all forms of 
abortion and how this decision could affect women's health. 
According to the minister, the law will create fear and 
confusion, adversely affecting the ability of medical 
doctors, clinics, and hospitals to provide treatment for 
women with high risk or unviable pregnancies, as well as for 
rape victims.  Gurdian expressed regret that the medical 
community was shut out of the legislative debate that was 
strongly influenced by Catholic church and Evangelical group 
interests.  END SUMMARY 
 
RELIGION, POLITICS, AND RUSH TO JUDGMENT 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶2.  (C) Minister Gurdian informed poloffs on November 21 that 
the National Assembly's recent decision to criminalize all 
forms of abortion was passed "too quickly," without 
consulting medical professionals, and with little thought to 
the consequences of this law and its potentially harmful 
effects on women.  The change in the Penal Code criminalizes 
both the woman who undergoes an abortion and the physician 
who performs the procedure, imposing a prison sentence of 
four to eight years.  She noted that the National Assembly 
failed to clearly define the concept of therapeutic abortion 
as the only legal procedure for women with at-risk 
pregnancies to terminate a pregnancy to save a mother's life. 
 Gurdian added that under past legislation, permission to 
undergo a therapeutic abortion 
required the certification of three medical doctors. 
 
¶3.  (C) Minister Gurdian lamented that lawmakers did not take 
into account the health implications and adverse effects on 
women when they changed the Penal Code, asserting that the 
technical experts were "shut out of the 
debate."  She opined that lawmakers were "misinformed, and 
not clear about what they were penalizing," noting the lack 
of differentiation between therapeutic abortions that are 
used only in emergencies and those that are "optional" or 
elective abortions.  Although she was somewhat cryptic in 
alluding to the influence of religion on Nicaraguan politics, 
Gurdian volunteered that the National Assembly likely rushed 
the legislation through before the 
November 5 election for political reasons and under pressure 
from both the Catholic and Evangelical churches. 
 
FEAR FACTOR WILL PUT MORE WOMEN AT RISK 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶4. (C) Minister Gurdian described the change in legislation 
as a "conflict of ethics and intervention," arguing that the 
fear of punishment will prevent doctors from providing 
treatment when the life of the mother is in danger or when 
the fetus is unviable.  Rather than reducing the number of 
abortions, she believes the new law will lead to a higher 
incidence of illegal, unsafe abortions, and increase the 
incidence of maternal mortality.  She added that the 
Nicaraguan press contributed to the spread of fear and 
confusion by printing sensationalist stories that claimed 
women were dying as a result of the law without thorough 
investigation of the alleged incidents. 
 
CONTINUITY IN HEALTH MINISTRY 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶5.  (C) On other matters related to the Health Ministry, 
Gurdian informed poloffs that she did not anticipate that her 
ministry would undergo any major turnover with the transition 
to an Ortega government.  The Minister predicts 
President-elect Ortega will want to maintain "continuity" in 
the health department since he declared health as one of his 
top campaign promises. (NOTE: A December 1 TV morning news 
program and today's daily La Prensa speculated that Gurdian 
will stay on as Health Minister for at least a year.)  She 
also expressed her appreciation for the USG's help in 
treating the burn victims who survived a deadly explosion in 
a fireworks manufacturing plant near the city of Granada 
earlier this month.

¶6. (U) Prior to her appointment as Minister of Health in 
December 2002, Margarita Gurdian served as Vice Minister of 
Health from 2002-2004, and has had extensive experience in 
the health field in both the government and NGO sectors.  She

Children and Family (FONIF) 1996-97, and before that she was 
with the Ministry of Social Action where she held several 
positions including as delegate representing populations 
vulnerable to natural disasters from 1993-95.  She was also 
Oxfam International's representative to Nicaragua.  She began 
her career as Vice Counsul at the Nicaraguan Consulate 
General in Los Angeles (1979-83). Gurdian earned her B.A. and 
M.A from the University of California, in Riverside (UCR) and 
Los Angeles (UCLA) respectively; and completed additional 
studies at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins. She was also the 
head of the Nicaraguan delegation to UNICEF to present and 
defend the 1997-2001 Nicaragua Five Year Plan. 
 
 
COMMENT

¶7. (U) Minister Gurdian  and the Minister of Family are the 
only two women to hold any of the 12 cabinet level positions 
in the current Bolanos administration. President-elect Ortega 
has pledged to appoint women to half 
of cabinet level positions in his government. END COMMENT
