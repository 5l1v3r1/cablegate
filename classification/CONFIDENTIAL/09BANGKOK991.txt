SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The RTG has formally informed the Embassy via diplomatic note of new measures against former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra: the issuance of a new arrest warrant for inciting mob violence, and the revocation of Thaksin's Thai passport. These steps follow the eruption of mob violence in Pattaya and Bangkok by United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) "redshirts" in conjunction with April 10-14 demonstrations; Thaksin encouraged these demonstrations during public appearances by video link from abroad. The RTG has also requested the assistance of the Nicaraguan government, which has provided Thaksin with a diplomatic passport (reftel), in securing Thaksin's return to Thailand (and the MFA shared with us in confidence an aide-memoire sent to Managua -- see para 5).
 
¶2. (C) Comment: Thaksin's return to Thailand could prove problematic for the government, energizing his supporters and possibly leading to further confrontations. The RTG has learned, however, that Thaksin retains an ability to cause significant disruption from abroad, and the RTG will likely continue to try to work with other governments to request Thaksin's extradition and constrain his freedom of action while he remains overseas. The MFA has asked that we weigh in with Managua regarding Thaksin's status, but we have been non-committal. Post is discussing with the bureau of Consular Affairs our recommendation for a "00" visa lookout entry for Thaksin. End Summary and Comment.

THAKSIN'S STATUS IN NICARAGUA

¶5. (SBU) The MFA provided us with a copy of an April 17 
aide-memoire that the MFA prepared for the Nicaraguan 
government (and asked that we be discreet about the fact they 
shared it with us).  The text of that aide-memoire follows: 
 
BEGIN TEXT OF AIDE-MEMOIRE: 
 
Aide-Memoire 
 
1) With reference to Press Release issued on 15 April 2009 by the Coordinator of the Council of Communication and Citizenship of the Republic of Nicaragua stating that the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua, under the instruction of H.E. President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua, has granted Mr. Thaksin Shinawatra, former Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand, a diplomatic passport and accredited him as the Ambassador in Special Mission, the Royal Thai Government would like to clarify the present status of Mr. Shinawatra as follows;
 
- Mr. Thaksin Shinawatra was convicted and sentenced to 2 year imprisonment by the Thai Supreme Court's Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions for abusing his authority in the purchase of land by his wife in the Ratchadapisek area of Bangkok. After the sentence, Mr. Shinawatra fled the country since August 2008.
 
- Presently, Mr. Shinawatra is now also under the arrest warrant of Thai court on the charge of inciting unrest and riots in the Kingdom of Thailand during 10-13 April 2009.
 
- The Royal Thai Government has revoked his diplomatic passport since 12 December 2008 and his ordinary passport since 12 April 2009. The decision to revoke all Thai passports of Mr. Shinawatra was made by the Royal Thai Government after it became clear that this person intentionally committed offences against his home country and that his actions will further prejudice the interests of the Kingdom of Thailand and that of the Thai people.
 
- The Royal Thai Government has accordingly informed all countries with diplomatic relations with Thailand of such revocation.
 
- Under Thai laws and regulations, Mr. Shinawatra still retains Thai nationality and in principle Thai law does not recognize dual nationality.
 
2) In connection with the grant of diplomatic passport and accreditation as Ambassador in Special Mission by the Government of Nicaragua, the Royal Thai Government would like to seek further details from the Government of Nicaragua as regards any status, rights or privileges granted to Mr. Shinawatra by the Government of Nicaragua.
 
3) In view of the friendly and long-standing diplomatic relations between the Kingdom of Thailand and the Republic of Nicaragua, the Royal Thai Government strongly requests cooperation from the latter as follows;
 
- To ensure that Mr. Shinawatra does not, from within the territory of Nicaragua, engage in any activities that are inconsistent with Thai laws and regulations, or that interfere with the internal situation of the Kingdom of Thailand, or that may harm Thai ordre public or national security or destabilize the Kingdom of Thailand in any way.

- To inform the Royal Thai Government of Mr. Shinawatra's whereabouts and, if he resides in Nicaragua, to assist the Royal Thai Government in handing over Mr. Shinawatra to the Thai authorities in order that he serves his sentence and attends other relevant legal proceedings in the Kingdom of Thailand.
 
- To start negotiation with the Kingdom of Thailand, at the earliest opportunity, with a view to concluding an extradition treaty between the two countries. An early response from the Government of Nicaragua in this regard would be highly appreciated.

¶6. (SBU) Note: The aide-memoire errs in asserting that Thaksin fled after his sentencing. In fact, Thaksin fled in August 2008 while his trial was ongoing; he was not convicted and sentenced until October 2008. See refs B and C.

¶7. (SBU) The MFA provided us with a diplomatic note

text follows:
