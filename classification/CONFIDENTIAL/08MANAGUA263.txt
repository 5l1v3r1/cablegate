SUBJECT: ORTEGA TIGHTENS GRIP ON NICARAGUAN NATIONAL POLICE 
AND ARMY 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary:  On February 27, Nicaraguan President Daniel 
Ortega stated his intention to bypass the Nicaraguan Ministry 
of Government and the Ministry of Defense by assuming direct 
control of the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) and the 
Nicaraguan Army, "without any intermediary."  Ortega's 
statement was widely criticized by the Nicaraguan media, 
political analysts, and the National Assembly, with National 
Assembly Defense and Government Committee Chairman Enrique 
Quinonez publicly observing that the proposed change fit in 
perfectly with Ortega's "dictatorial spirit."  On March 3, 
Ortega apparently utilized this new chain-of-command 
structure to personally order the dismissal of five senior 
NNP officials.  Regarding the dismissals, National Assembly 
Justice Committee Chairman Jose Pallais expressed his concern 
that Ortega's "politically motivated" decisions would damage 
the independence and professionalism of the NNP.  End Summary.

¶2. (C) During a February 27 ceremony marking the presentation 
of the NNP's annual "State of Operations" report to the 
office of the President, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega 
declared his intent to, "assume the direct command of the 
Army and the Police without any intermediary, with 
(Nicaraguan Army) General (Omar) Halleslevens and Police 
Chief Aminta Granera."  Ortega justified the move as 
"necessary" to deal with a world in which "crime and violence 
multiply by the day."  Ortega's statement was widely 
criticized by the Nicaraguan media, political analysts, and 
the National Assembly, with National Assembly Defense and 
Government Committee Chairman Enrique Quinonez publicly 
observing that the proposed change fit in perfectly with 
Ortega's "dictatorial spirit." Political analyst and 
Nicaraguan constitutional specialist Alejandro Serrano 
Caldera opined that although the President clearly has the 
constitutional power to directly control the Nicaraguan Army, 
the proposed take-over of the NNP was illegal under Article 
97 of the Nicaraguan Constitution, which specifies that the 
President should exercise control over the NNP only through 
the "proper corresponding Ministry."

¶3. (C) Following this announcement, on March 3 Nicaraguan 
media widely reported Ortega's direct dismissal of five 
senior NNP officials.  The officials are as follows:  NNP 
Public Relations Chief Alonso Sevilla, Chontales District 
Chief Jose Roman Orozco, Judicial Auxiliary Chief Denis 
Tinoco Zeledon, Finance Division Chief Rosalpina Cabrales, 
and Juvenile Affairs Chief Hamyn Gurdian.  Nicaraguan 
newspaper La Prensa noted that all of the senior officials 
were well-respected and considered close allies of NNP Chief 
Aminta Granera, and speculated that political considerations 
were foremost in Ortega's decision to dismiss the five 
officials. Regarding the dismissals, National Assembly 
Justice Committee Chairman Jose Pallais expressed his concern 
that Ortega's "politically motivated" decisions would damage 
the independence and professionalism of the NNP.

¶4. (C) Comment:  Ortega's statement and subsequent actions 
reflect his desire to regress both the NNP and the Nicaraguan 
Army back into completely subsidiary organs of the Sandinista 
Party, as they once were during the days of the Sandinista 
Revolution.  The continued institutional independence and 
professionalism of the NNP and the Nicaraguan Army has been 
one of the few bright spots remaining under Ortega's 
increasingly authoritarian regime and the foundation of our 
 
strongest remaining areas of cooperation with the current 
administration.  Should Ortega's remarks result in the 
actual, official removal of the Ministry of Government from 
the NNP management structure, such a development could have 
deleterious effects on Post's ability to carry out continued 
counternarcotics support for NNP units and operations.  In 
fact, this has already occurred, as one of the dismissed NNP 
officials, former Juvenile Affairs Chief Hamyn Gurdian, was 
one of the Embassy's strongest partners on narcotics demand 
reduction programs.  Post will continue to seek clarification 
regarding Ortega's statements with GON officials.  End 
Comment.
