Classified By: Ambassador Adam Ereli for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

1.(C) Ambassador met February 13 with King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa to discuss issues that included reftel demarche on Kosovo independence. He told the King that we expect Kosovo to declare its independence soon and that the U.S. is looking to its friends for early and public recognition.

2.(C) King Hamad replied, "That's hot! We're with you." He then turned to Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Ahmed bin Attiyatallah Al-Khalifa and instructed him to coordinate with Foreign Minister Khalid bin Mohammed on necessary actions and timing. (Note: The FM is currently in Singapore on an official visit and is due back on February 14. End note.) Attiyatallah commented that Bahrain would need to coordinate with the GCC and added, "This has to be ready fast." ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI
