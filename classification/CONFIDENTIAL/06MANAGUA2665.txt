REFORMS 
 
Classified By: CDA Peter Brennan for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: During a December 5 lunch with poloff, 
Nicaraguan Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) Chief of Staff 
Rodrigo Barreto commented that the CSE magistrates are open 
to suggestions to reform the electoral laws and regulations 
-- although not from certain prominent domestic NGOs with 
whom they have contentious relationships.  He also said that 
the process of campaign fund reimbursement is under way and 
has caused tensions within the political parties, who are in 
charge of disbursing the funds internally.  As in many other 
governmental institutions, CSE functionaries who are not 
affiliated with the FSLN are afraid of losing their jobs next 
year.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) When asked if the CSE magistrates would be open to 
reform suggestions, specifically from the OAS and EU final 
elections reports, Barreto replied affirmatively.  He noted 
that the CSE plans to keep open the Municipal Electoral 
Councils (CEMs) to facilitate the ongoing distribution of 
cedulas (national voter/ID cards) and is requesting funds 
from the treasury to keep them open permanently.  Part of the 
distribution problem is caused by the constant relocation of 
the CEMs, which are opened and closed based on budget 
resources, he explained.  Barreto noted that CSE officials 
have met with representatives of the local European Union 
mission regarding ongoing technical assistance. 
 
¶3. (C) While the CSE is open to working with the OAS, EU, and 
other international donors, Barreto commented, they are not 
disposed to have any further contact with local observer 
groups Etica y Transparencia and IPADE.  According to 
Barreto, the magistrates are "upset" with these groups for 
failing to unequivocally endorse the presidential and deputy 
elections. 
 
¶4. (C) Barreto mentioned that the political parties are 
already in the process of receiving and distributing their 
campaign expenditure reimbursements.  He explained that the 
reimbursements are based on one percent of the national 
budget divided by the percentage of votes obtained by each 
party in the general election.  The parties themselves 
determine how to share the funds internally between the 
candidates and allied political organizations, which has 
caused considerable angst and internal feuding, especially 
within the PLC, he said.  (Note: The parties are projected to 
receive the following reimbursements: FSLN - $3,440,000; ALN 
- $2,550,000; PLC - $2,400,000; MRS - $500,000.  The AC did 
not receive the minimum four percent of the national vote to 
qualify for reimbursement.  End Note.) 
 
¶5. (C) Barreto commented that many of the functionaries in 
the CSE who are not affiliated with the FSLN (Barreto 
included) are concerned about keeping their positions after 
the change in administration.  He agreed that the FSLN made 
too many promises regarding employment in government 
institutions during the campaign that they will be hard 
pressed to fulfill.  (Bio Note: Barreto mentioned that his 
links with the Chamorro family -- his wife was married to a 
Chamorro and his stepson is a Chamorro -- shield him to some 
degree and may provide another avenue for employment.  Also, 
his wife is co-owner/director of the local Montessori 
preschool that is "doing very well."  End Note.) 
 
¶6. (C) Comment: Barreto's remarks that the CSE will not be 
receptive to input on electoral law and regulatory reforms 
from certain NGOs who had the temerity to question the CSE's 
performance, are disturbing.  While the CSE may be willing to 
address electoral reforms on their terms, the donor community 
should not allow the magistrates to take an "a la carte" 
approach and then label the Council "cooperative."  We will 
continue to keep a close watch on the most crucial reforms -- 
those involving cedula production and distribution and 
control over the civil registry.
