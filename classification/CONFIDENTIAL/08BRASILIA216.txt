SUBJECT: BRAZIL TO WAIT AND SEE ON KOSOVO INDEPENDENCE 
 
REF: A) SECSTATE 13716 B) BRASILIA 00084 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Phillip Chicola.  Reason: 1.4 (b 
) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) In the Ambassador's absence from the capital, 
Political Counselor followed up Ambassador's initial demarche 
on Kosovo independence (ref B), delivering Ref A points to 
Brazil's Ministry of External Relations (MRE) Eastern 
European Acting Director Rodrigo Mendes Carlos de Almeida. 
De Almeida said that the MRE had taken USG views under 
advisement and understands the substantive reasons that 
Kosovo independence is merited, but is concerned that, as 
UNSC Resolution 1244 is the basis for the process, the 
outcome should be determined by UNSC action.  In the MRE's 
view, a unilateral declaration of independence under these 
circumstances does not allow for immediate recognition.  As a 
result, Brazil does not/not plan to recognize Kosovo 
independence immediately based on a unilateral declaration, 
but will see how the process unfolds, both with regard to 
Kosovo government commitments regarding adherence to the 
Ahtisaari recommendations and international community 
support, before making a decision on recognizing Kosovo's 
independence. 
 
¶2. (C) Comment: This position is not unexpected, as it fits 
with Brazil's historic preference for multilateral, and 
particularly UN-backed solutions, as well the GOB's tendency 
to follow rather than lead on potentially contentious issues 
on which it does not see core national interests at stake.
