¶1.  (C)  FOLLOWS IS AN EMBASSY DRAFT BACKGROUND PAPER FOR 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 02        VATICA  03119  111605Z 
POSSIBLE VISIT BY PRESIDENT BUSH TO THE VATICAN. 
 


¶2.  (U)  BEGIN TEXT.  THE VATICAN IS VIGOROUS AND ACTIVE 
IN THE GLOBAL PURSUIT OF PEACE, DEMOCRACY, HUMAN 
DEVELOPMENT, AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.  WHILE THE 
VATICAN ASSERTS PUBLICLY THAT A FUNDAMENTAL TENET OF ITS FOREIGN POLICY IS DEFENSE OF THE HUMAN PERSON (LARGELY CONGRUENT WITH THE US SUPPORT FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION, DEMOCRATIZATION, AND HUMAN RIGHTS), IN REALITY IT FREQUENTLY ACTS JUST LIKE A NATION-STATE IN PURSUING ITS OWN PERCEIVED SELF-INTEREST. THE VATICAN IS THUS ACTIVE ACROSS AN OUTSIZED NUMBER OF CRISIS AREAS IN EFFORTS TO RESOLVE CONFLICT AND PROMOTE RECONCILIATION AND DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION, AND TO PROMOTE THE WELFARE OF CATHOLICS. IN THE BALKANS, THE VATICAN SEEKS TO PROMOTE PEACE AND RECONCILIATION FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS, TO PROTECT ""CATHOLIC"" PEOPLE AND INTERESTS, AND TO REINFORCE ITS OUTREACH TO THE ORTHODOX WORLD.  A KEY GOAL OF POPE 
JOHN PAUL II IS TO HEAL THE THOUSAND-YEAR SCHISM BETWEEN CATHOLICS AND ORTHODOX, IN ORDER TO CREATE A CONTINENT, FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE URALS, AT PEACE WITH ITSELF AND REINFORCED WITH THE UNIFIED SPIRITUAL FOUNDATION OF CHRISTIANITY. 
 


¶3. (SBU)  THE USG HAS ENGAGED THE VATICAN TO PROMOTE 
CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN THE BALKANS.  DURING THE NATO AIR CAMPAIGN IN KOSOVO, WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE VATICAN TO HEAD OFF ITS  CRITICISM OF THE MILITARY ACTION (A PAPAL DENUNCIATION OF THE CAMPAIGN AS AN ""UNJUST WAR"" WOULD HAVE MADE ALLIANCE SOLIDARITY THAT MUCH HARDER TO SUSTAIN). MORE RECENTLY, WE HAVE SOUGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

VATICAN TO EXERCISE A MODERATING INFLUENCE ON CROAT- 
NATIONALIST CLERGY IN HERZEGOVINA.  WE HAVE ALSO PROMOTED INTER-COMMUNAL RECONCILIATION BY DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING PROJECTS IN KOSOVO AND BOSNIA IN CONJUNCTION WITH VATICAN-AFFILIATED NGO, THE SANT'EGIDIO COMMUNITY. WITH THE SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF EMBASSY VATICAN, SANT'EGIDIO HOSTED A SUCCESSFUL INTER-RELIGIOUS CONFERENCE WITH THE KEY BOSNIAN RELIGIOUS LEADERS JUNE 8, 
¶2001.  THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT'S PD/ECA OFFICE.
