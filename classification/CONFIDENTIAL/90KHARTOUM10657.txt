SUBJECT: VERY LITTLE ANTI-SEMITISM IN URUGUAY, BUT NEED FOR 
EDUCATION 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Frank E. Baxter 
for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) Special Envoy to Combat and Monitor Anti-Semitism 
Gregg Rickman and Karen Paikin visited Uruguay July 6-7, and 
found few overt manifestations of anti-Semitism in the 
country.  The visit included meetings with Jewish community 
members including Montevideo Mayor Ricardo Ehrlich, and with 
the Honorary Commission Against Racism, Xenophobia, and all 
forms of Discrimination.  The Jewish Community reported 
feeling generally free from discrimination, but stated 
concerns of increased Iranian presence, declining quality of 
education, and decreasing Jewish population due to low 
birthrates and migration.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Strong Jewish Community 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The Special Envoy met with representatives from B'nai 
B'rith in Uruguay, the Uruguayan Central Committee for 
Israel, and other members of the Jewish Community.  These 
interlocutors reported that there are many Jewish leaders in 
the government and that they have enjoyed support from 
current and past governments.  They noted no specific 
instances of anti-Semitism, but pointed out that the media in 
Uruguay is generally critical of Israeli policy.  One 
grievance is that negative comments slip into the local press 
because international wire reports are used verbatim without 
modifying for tone or content.  Additionally, the Jewish 
Community is concerned that the declining economic situation 
could lead to more anti-Semitism as disenfranchised people 
look for scapegoats. 
 
 
Holocaust Education Controversial 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Ministry of Education's Director of Human 
Rights, Maria Elena Martinez, included Holocaust education 
under the umbrella of human rights education and mentioned it 
is not part of the required curriculum.  She also said that 
there is limited education on slavery and genocide, including 
that related to Uruguay's own African and indigenous 
descendants.  The GOU is currently reforming its education 
system, and strong political disagreements over how to 
address the human rights abuses during the military 
dictatorship and by insurgent guerillas are blocking much 
needed changes.  The Special Envoy stated a commitment to 
pursue the participation of Uruguay in the Task Force for 
International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, 
Remembrance, and Research, in order to facilitate Holocaust 
education in the country. 
 
¶4. (U) Despite being left out of the official curriculum, 
there is significant informal Holocaust education including a 
recent two-month exhibit attended by 35,000 people, 10,000 of 
whom were high school students.  The exhibit was a private 
initiative but was housed at Montevideo's City Hall and 
received significant public support.  Additionally, the 
Holocaust Memorial, prominently located in the city, was 
first of its kind in South America.  During the visit to the 
Holocaust Memorial, however, the Special Envoy was 
disappointed to see it has fallen into disrepair and suffered 
the same effects of vandalism as many other parts of the 
city.  Note: Although we are aware of one occurrence of 
anti-Semitic vandalism on the Memorial in the past, 
currently, there is no evidence that the vandalism is 
motivated by anti-Semitism.  END NOTE.  When discussed with 
Mayor Ehrlich, the mayor expressed disappointment and 
promised to visit the site. 
 
Concern about Iranian-Uruguayan Relationship 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Before his arrival, Special Envoy Rickman was aware 
of the Jewish Community's concern about the seemingly growing 
presence of Iran in the region.  With the recent conviction 
of Iranian nationals involved in the 2002 and 2004 bombings 
of the Jewish Community Center and the Israeli Embassy in 
Buenos Aires, the Jewish Community in Montevideo is acutely 
conscious of the new Iranian Ambassador's visibility.  Iran 
is actively pursuing increased economic and political 
relations with Uruguay and other countries in the region. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Nevertheless, the interlocutors from the Jewish 
community generally believe that the relationship is based on 
 
trade and that Uruguay is not ideologically vulnerable to 
Iranian influence.  Only unfounded mentions were made to 
suggest that Iran was funding anti-Israeli press and student 
groups. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7. (C) Overall, the Jewish Community members seemed more 
concerned with the general economic situation in Uruguay than 
with discrimination.  The decline of the education system was 
noted by all.  The lack of human rights education, including 
education on the Holocaust, underscored that deficiencies 
exist.  Given the sensitivity of education system reform, it 
would be difficult and likely counterproductive for the USG 
to suggest changes.  Involving Uruguay in the Task Force for 
International Cooperation for Holocaust Education, 
Remembrance and Research, as recommended by the Special 
Envoy, would be a positive step forward.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶8.  (U) S/E Gregg Rickman cleared this message.
