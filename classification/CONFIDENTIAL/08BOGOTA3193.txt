SUBJECT: URIBE-SUPREME COURT TENSIONS ESCALATE 

REF: BOGOTA 03007 

Classified By: Political Counselor John Creamer 
Reasons 1.4 (b and d) 

SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (C) President Uribe intensified his offensive against the 
Supreme Court the week of August 24 after the revelation that 
senior GOC officials met three times at the presidential 
place with emissaries of extradited former paramilitary 
leader Diego Murillo Bejarano (Don Berna).  The two allegedly 
turned over evidence showing that the lead magistrate in the 
Supreme Court's investigation of the parapolitical scandal 
was seeking false evidence to incriminate Uribe.  Supreme 
Court President Javier Ricaurte publicly charged that the 
meetings revealed a GOC plot to derail the parapolitical
investigations. Ricaurte later told us privately he had tried 
to ignore previous disparaging comments from Uribe, but that 
the news of the meetings with Don Berna's representatives 
were unacceptable.  He expects executive-judicial tensions to 
remain high as long as the parapolitical investigations 
continue. 


URIBE DEFENDS STAFF, LASHES OUT AGAINST SUPREME COURT 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
¶2. (U) President Alvaro Uribe used a nationally broadcast 
press conference on August 25 to intensify his criticism of 
the Supreme Court.  Uribe charged Ivan Velasquez, the lead 
auxiliary magistrate in the investigations of 
paramilitary-linked politicians, with "trafficking in 
witnesses" and with "getting drunk" with witnesses.  Uribe 
further charged that the Supreme Court itself had become an 
obstacle to investigating any wrongdoing by Velasquez, with 
whom Uribe has had a long and public feud (see reftel).  The 
President alleged that a former paramilitary member 
(Tasmania) who had recanted public accusations against 
Velasquez had done so for political, not judicial, reasons. 

¶3. (U) Uribe also strongly defended the decision of 
presidential legal advisor Edmundo del Castillo and 
presidential spokesman Cesar Velazquez to meet at the Casa de 
Narino with Diego Alvarez, an attorney for Don Berna, and 
Antonio Lopez (Job), a demobilized Berna henchman who was 
murdered in July in Medellin.  Uribe contended that Don 
Berna's representatives had claimed to have evidence against 
Velasquez, and that del Castillo had let the two drive into 
the Casa Narino--a privilege usually reserved for senior 
dignitaries--due to the delicacy of that evidence.  The 
president played video footage of the vehicle entering the 
building, while the head of the Casa de Narino's security 
detail showed the palace's official entry log recording the 
pair's entrance.  Such documentation, argued Uribe, proved 
there was no intent to keep the meeting clandestine. 

RICAUARTE CLAIMS MEETINGS PROVE PLOT AGAINST COURT 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
¶4. (U) A few hours before Uribe's press conference, Supreme 
Court President Javier Ricaurte publicly denounced the Casa 
deNarino meetings as proof that some GOC officials are 
trying to discredit the Court in an effort to derail its 
investigation of politicians' links to former paramilitaries. 
Ricaurte charged that any evidence against Velasquez or 
other judges should have been turned over to prosecutors and 
judges who have more legal expertise than presidential aides 
to determine whether the  evidence constituted a crime.  The 
magistrate also questioned how Uribe could call for the 
arrest of members of an infamous Medellin crime group at the 
same time that some of his top aides met with other members 
of that group.  Ricaurte suggested that the Colombia's 
Prosecutor General and the International Criminal Court (ICC) 
should investigate.  Court members met with ICC Prosecutor 
Luis Moreno Ocampo on August 25 and reportedly voiced their 
concern that the executive is trying to sabotage their 
investigation of the parapolitical scandal. 


PRESS PIECE THAT SPARKED THE FEUD 
--------------------------------- 
¶5. (C) Uribe's outburst followed public revelations that GOC 
officials del Castillo and Velsquez met three times--one at 
the end of last year, one in March of this year, and one in 
April of this year--in the Casa de Narino with Don Berna
emissaries Alvarez and Lopez.  The two reportedly offered 
video recordings showing that Supreme Court Auxiliary 
Magistrate Ivan Velasquez was seeking to undermine Uribe by 
collecting false evidence implicating the president in the 
parapolitical scandal.  The two also gave the presidential 
aides videotapes purportedly showing a lawyer claiming to 
represent Velasquez soliciting money from Alvarez in exchange 
for favors from the court for Don Berna.  Colombian National 
Police Director Oscar Naranjo privately told us that the 
meetings were organized by senior Uribe advisor Jose Obdulio
Gaviria.

FORMER PRESIDENT CESAR GAVIRIA CRITICIZES GOC STANCE 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
¶6. (U) Liberal Party chief and former president (1990-94) 
Cesar Gaviria publicly demanded that Uribe explain how 
paramilitary-linked figures could so easily enter the 
presidential palace, and suggested that the ICC might examine 
evidence linking GOC officials with figures tied to crimes 
against humanity.  Gaviria also rejected Uribe's charge that 
his own administration had links to an anti-Pablo Escobar 
vigilante group (Los Pepes) and denied Uribe's suggestion 
that his own administration had bowed to narcotrafficker
pressure by including a ban on extradition in the 1991 
Constitution.  On August 27, Vice-President Francisco Santos 
urged President Uribe and opposition political leaders to 
moderate their discourse, arguing that the growing 
polarization is damaging the country. 

RICAURTE ANGRY, BAFFLED OVER URIBE'S MOTIVES 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶7. (C) Ricaurte told us privately on August 26 that he was 
angry over Uribe's charges. He explained that his commitment 
to better executive-judicial branch relations had kept him 
from responding to previous criticisms from the president, 
but that he had found himself unable to remain silent in the 
wake of the latest revelations.  Ricaurte stressed that 
bringing known criminals into the Casa de Narino was 
unacceptable.  Ricaurte said that despite Uribe's charges of 
judicial bias, the Court simply follows evidence wherever it 
may lead. 

¶8. (C) Ricaurte offered three theories for Uribe's continued 
attacks on the Court.  First, that Uribe believes the Court 
is investigating him--which Ricaurte says he has assured the 
president is not the case.  Second, Uribe fears that "all 
roads lead to Rome" and that ongoing investigations into 
presidential allies will eventually incriminate him. 
Finally, Ricaurte speculated that Uribe is complying with 
pressure from his congressional allies to block the 
investigations.  Ricaurte did not say which of the three he 
believed, but he offered that he does not see the current 
tensions abating as long as the parapolitical investigations 
continue.
