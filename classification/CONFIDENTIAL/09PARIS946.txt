SUBJECT: FRENCH SENATE LEADERS ON MIDDLE EAST: YEMEN, PEACE
PROCESS, IRAN OUR TOP PRIORITIES
Classified By: Political Counselor Andrew R. Young for reasons 1.4(B) A
ND (D).
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: After visiting over 250 dignitaries in
every country in the Middle East (except Oman), two French
Senate Foreign Affairs Committee members stated July 9 that
French foreign policy in the Middle East should set three
priorities: 1) advance the Israeli-Palestinian peace process;
2) prevent Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons; and 3)
thwart the growing influence of extremists in Yemen.
Senators Jean Francois-Poncet (former Foreign Minister and
UMP member) and Monique Cerisier-ben Guiga (Socialist Party)
recommend France begin talking with Hamas, deepen sanctions
against Iran, and prevent Yemen from becoming a base for Al
Qaeda. While these Senators speak on their own account and
have views that differ from GOF positions, they are
influential opinion shapers with whom the Embassy will remain
engaged as we advocate for U.S. interests. END SUMMARY.
¶2. (U) In marked contrast to President Sarkozy’s
interpretation of Iran’s nuclear program, Ben Guiga said that
France should not view Iran’s alleged pursuit of nuclear
weapons as posing a security threat because, she argued,
"nuclear weapons are primarily a means of dissuasion (rather
than aggression)." Instead, she said, France should prevent
Iran’s development of nuclear capability because such a
development would destabilize the region and likely lead
Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt to pursue nuclear weapons as
well. France must be prepared to tighten sanctions against
Iran in close coordination with China and Russia, Ben Guiga
asserted. Francois-Poncet agreed with Ben Guiga, noting that
if Iran ends its nuclear program, it will be due to US
pressure, and that diplomacy toward Iran must include both
carrots and sticks.
¶3. (U) Francois-Poncet argued that since resolution of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is also critical to regional
stability, "Americans and Europeans should talk to all
parties, including Hamas, and review the conditions imposed
by the Quartet." Hamas, he said, could be part of the peace.
Ben Guiga concurred, asserting that Hamas’s origins are as a
religious movement, and claiming that not "until recently"
has it become more militant. The Senators urged Israel to
end the blockade of Gaza and freeze settlements in the West
Bank. Ben Guiga called for Marwan Barghouti and Gilad Shalit
to be part of a prisoner exchange, saying that Barghouti
would be able to bring together Hamas and Fatah.
Francois-Poncet acknowledged that the deep divide between
Hamas and Fatah will not be overcome soon, but stated that
their reconciliation was critical to achieving a lasting
political solution.
¶4. (U) Finally, the Senators urged the international
community to "save Yemen so that it does not become the next
base for Al Qaeda." Although it is not yet a failed state,
the Senators argued, Yemen, a country of 22 million people,
is in the process of becoming one. The Senators will publish
the full report of their findings and recommendations in
September and will host a colloquium on the subject in
January 2010.
¶5. (C) COMMENT: While these Senators speak on their own
account and have views that differ from GOF positions, their
extensive recent tour of the Middle East provides these two
Senators credibility with which to influence their fellow
Senators and Deputies, as well as public opinion. Notably,
several of their positions conflict with stated GOF policy:
their implied belief that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons to
"dissuade attack" rather than to project power; their call
for Marwan Barghouti and Gilad Shalit to form part of an
Israel-Hamas prisoner exchange; and their recommendation that
the USG and EU talk to Hamas and amend the Quartet
conditions. Post will continue to engage with these opinion
shapers to advance U.S. interests in these areas. END
COMMENT.
