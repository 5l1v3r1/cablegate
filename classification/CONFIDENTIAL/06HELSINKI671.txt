SUBJECT: FINNISH EU PRESIDENCY REITERATES SUPPORT FOR 
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN BIH 
 
REF: STATE 113492 
 
Classified By: POLCHIEF GREGORY THOME FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
(C) PolChief delivered subject demarche July 14 to MFA 
Western Balkans Office Director Juha Ottman.  Ottman said 
the GOF, both nationally and in its current role as EU 
President, fully supports constitutional reform in BiH; 
shares our concerns about the possible negative impact of 
the PACE resolution, and would not welcome any resolutions 
that might have the possible impact of "re-opening Dayton". 
He added that the PACE resolution will have no impact on 
Finnish policies and that the GOF will urge others to 
downplay the resolution.
