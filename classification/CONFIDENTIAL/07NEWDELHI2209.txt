External Affairs (MEA) Joint Secretary (Americas) Gaitri 
Kumar April 27.  In a follow-up conversation May 9, Kumar 
noted that the Asia Democracy Partnership seemed similar to 
the Partnership for Democratic Governance, support for which 
had been solicited by Stephen D. Krasner, Senior Advisor to 
the Secretary of State in a letter to the MEA April 30.

different partnerships and decide where best to expend its 
resources.
