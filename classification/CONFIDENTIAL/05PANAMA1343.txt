(C) On June 16, Ambassador Watt delivered reftel A and B 
talking points on USG priorities for UN reform to Foreign 
Minister Samuel Lewis.  Lewis expressed interest in USG 
priorities for UN reform and on Security Council (SC) 
expansion, saying that Panama, as the facilitator for 
institutional reform and SC reform, takes its role as one of 
the ten facilitators of the outcome document very seriously. 
Lewis said that he understands that the Chinese oppose 
permanent Japanese membership in the SC.  He noted the lack 
of consensus among Latin American countries regarding 
Brazil's desire for permanent SC membership.  As with the 
OAS, Panama believes it can work effectively to advance many 
common U.S.-Panama objectives in the UN, particularly in 
areas where active U.S. advocacy might be counter-productive. 
 Embassy will report any further developments to the 
Department.
