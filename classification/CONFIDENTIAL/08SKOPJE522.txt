Classified By: AMBASSADOR PATRICIA M. HASLACH FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND ( 
D) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary:  Unidentified Hmong-Americans are said to be 
recruiting Hmong from the holding camp in Thailand's 
Petchabun Province to return to Laos to stage incidents 
apparently in support of the three-decade-old but failing 
Hmong insurgency.  The Embassy is working to gather more 
information.  Meanwhile we are concerned about the safety of 
all concerned.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (C) An Embassy contact who has reported accurately in the 
past informed the Embassy by e-mail April 15 that 
unidentified Hmong Americans had recruited three teams of 
7-12 men each, apparently in early February, to go back to 
Laos "to cause trouble."  Shortly after this, the Embassy 
received reports of fire-fights along Route 13 north of the 
tourist city of Vang Vieng (about one third of the way from 
Vientiane north to Luang Prabang) which led first to a warden 
message and later a public announcement advising AmCits 
against travel in that area.  The contact said the February 
fighting was caused by these teams returning to Laos. 
 
¶3. (C) The contact also passed on reports that another 50 men 
had been sent to Bolikhamxai Province -- an area where the 
Embassy believes virtually all insurgents have surrendered to 
the Lao authorities or fled the country (Ref A).  The Embassy 
is not aware of any upsurge of fighting in Bolikhamsay. 
 
¶4. (C) The contact also reported that recruitment continued 
in early April, but the Hmong-Americans were only able to 
recruit 100 from the camp; their goal was reportedly 300 new 
fighters.  There is no additional information about the 
specific focus of this additional group of 100 men. 
 
Comment 
------------ 

¶5. (S) We are trying to set a time to meet this contact in 
person to be able to gather more precise information, 
including names of those involved if possible, than that 
which can be sent over the Internet.  We are increasingly 
concerned about the safety not only of the Hmong Americans 
who are reported to be engaged in recruiting these fighters 
to return to Laos but also the safety of this contact as well 
as that of respected Hmong activists such as Laura Xiong who 
have been working to help Hmong leaders, particularly those 
at the Nong Khai Immigration Detention Center (Ref C).  As 
per Ref B, there have been a series of more than 20 
assassinations in northeastern Thailand of Hmong Americans 
and Lao Americans during the past few years.  Those targeted 
for assassination have fallen into a nearly identifcal 
demographic -- that of those threatening Lao stability.
