TAGS: PGOV PREL PTER PHUM KJUS CO
SUBJECT: SUPREME COURT RULES EX-MEMBERS OF CONGRESS REMAIN 
UNDER FISCALIA JURISDICTION 

REF: BOGOTA 3359 

Classified By: Political Counselor John Creamer 
Reasons 1.4 (b and d) 

SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. (C) Colombia's Supreme Court opted on September 18 not to 
expand its powers to investigate members of Congress 
suspected of paramiliatary ties to include ex-legislators. 
Under current rules, the Court prosecutes and tries sitting 
senators and representatives; the Prosecutor General's Office 
(Fiscalia) prosecutes former members.  Supreme Court 
auxiliary magistrate Ivan Velasquez told us the Fiscalia is 
less aggressive than the Court in investigating parapolitical
ties, but an examination of the numbers in parapolitical
cases does not support this view.  Velasquez said the Court 
expects to charge additional legislators in the near future, 
including three leading legislators from Valle de Cauca.  End 
summary. 

COURT BACKS AWAY FROM CONFLICT 
------------------------------ 

¶2. (C) The Supreme Court opted on September 18 to retain the 
current rules--which were set by the Court during the Samper 
scandal in the 1990s--for investigating senators and members 
of Congress in the parapolitical cases. Presently, the Court 
investigates, prosecutes, and judges sitting members; former 
members (including those who resign in response to 
prosecution) enter the ordinary justice system and are 
investigated and prosecuted by the Fiscalia.  Lower courts 
determine guilt or innocence.  The media had speculated that 
the Court would reclaim the right to investigate and 
adjudicate all parapolitical cases involving 
legislators--including those already in the hands of the 
Fiscalia--due to concerns that defendants who resigned their 
seats fared better under the Fiscalia.  Auxiliary Supreme 
Court Magistrate Ivan Velasquez, the lead investigator in the 
parapolitical scandal, told us on September 22 that the 
Fiscalia was more susceptible to political pressure and 
corruption than the Supreme Court. 

¶3. (C) House President German Varon and Liberal Guillermo 
Rivera told us the 5-4 decision represented a conscious move 
by some members of the Court to step back from the recent 
conflict between the Court and Uribe.  Representative Carlos 
Piedrahidita told us Supreme Court Magistrate Leonidas 
Bustos--the swing vote in the decision--changed his vote to 
maintain the status quo.  Bustos reportedly wanted to avoid 
feeding the public perception of a "declaration of war" by 
the Court against the executive. 

FISCALIA NO EASIER THAN COURT ON PARAPOLITICIANS 
--------------------------------------------- --- 

¶4. (C) A close examination of the 70 cases of 
paramilitary-linked politicians shows that defendants who 
resign their seats do not receive softer treatment from the 
Fiscalia than from the Supreme Court.  Of the six former 
congressmen or senators who have been sentenced in 
parapolitical cases so far, two pleaded guilty under Fiscalia
prosecution, one was convicted under Fiscalia prosecution, 
and three were convicted by the Supreme Court.  Of the six 
former or current congressional representatives who have been 
acquitted, three were cleared under the ordinary justice 
system and three under the Supreme Court.  All twelve 
represented parties in the president's Congressional 
coalition, suggesting that partisan politics did not 
influence the Fiscalia's prosecution of cases. 

¶5.  (U) Similarly, both the Fiscalia and the Court have made 
ample use of their legal authority to imprison suspects 
despite criticisms of the Court by Uribe allies for using 
this harsh--if legal--practice.  As of late September, the 
Fiscalia has ordered fifteen into preventive detention; the 
Court has has ordered ten.  In addition, only four of the 
thirty-three members of Congress under investigation but not 
in jail have resigned their seats--indicating that many 
defendants do not perceive any benefit from having their 
cases prosecuted by the Fiscalia instead of the Court. 

COURT VIEWS 
----------- 

¶6. (C)  Velasquez defended the Court against charges of 
political bias, rejecting claims that it conducts secret 
investigations and does not allow suspects the opportunity to 
mount a defense.  He agreed that the Court's heavy reliance 
on witness testimony provided by former paramilitary members 
is a weakness, but said threats and violence against 
potential sources of physical evidence have made this 
inevitable.  The Court recognizes that its credibility is at 
stake, and is careful to develop multiple witnesses before 
bringing charges.  In response to executive claims that the 
Court is moving slowly on the FARC political cases, Velasquez 
noted that the FARC cases only started in June.  By contrast 
the court began the parapolitical investigations in early 
2005, and brought the first cases to trial in late 2006. 

CONFLICTS AND INVESTIGATIONS CONTINUE 
------------------------------------- 

¶8. (C) The Court's decision avoided another flare-up between 
Uribe and the Court, but the conflict is likely to continue. 
Velasquez said the parapolitical scandal will expand further, 
noting that the Court expects to bring charges against 
powerful Valle de Cauca and Convergencia Ciudadana Senator
Juan Carlos Martinez in the near future.  Martinez is close 
to Valle Governor Juan Carlos Abadia.  Extradited 
paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso also testified on 
September 25 before Colombia's Supreme Court (via video link 
from the United States) about para ties to politicians in 
Cordoba and Sucre.Varon and Rivera agreed the continuing 
investigations will provoke more Uribe-Court clashes.  Rivera 
said GOC officials wrongly believe the Supreme Court is 
biased against them (reftel).  They added that Uribe will 
respond aggressively if Court investigations ensnare more 
politicians linked to the executive.
