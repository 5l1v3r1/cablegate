SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a November 7th meeting, Yukos receiver Eduard 
Rebgun told us the company will cease to exist as soon as the 
court acknowledges receipt of his final report, which he 
submitted November 2nd.  Rebgun asserted that he had merely 
performed a professional duty to carry out a Russian court 
decision to liquidate a bankrupt company, and he was neither 
qualified nor interested in making any moral or legal 
judgments about the affair.  He said the October 31st Dutch 
court ruling (related to Yukos Finance, a Dutch subsidiary, 
reftel) against Monte Valle, owned by Amcit Steve Lynch, is 
"Lynch's problem," but that he would be willing to help with 
pending appeals.  Rebgun has filed his own appeal in the 
case, because he believes "the decision is wrong."

THE END OF YUKOS 
---------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Eduard Rebgun, the court-appointed Yukos receiver in 
charge of liquidating the company recently announced that the 
process is complete.  He confirmed to us in a November 7th 
meeting that he submitted his final report to responsible 
Russian court on November 2nd.  When the court acknowledges 
receipt (he implied this is a formality and would occur very 
soon), Yukos Oil Company will officially cease to exist. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Rebgun said the bankruptcy auctions brought in 877 
billion rubles (approx. $35 billion), out of which creditors 
were paid 873 billion rubles.  According to Rebgun, 76 
billion rubles (approx. $3.1 billion) of creditor claims, 
most of which was owed to the tax authorities for minor taxes 
and fees, went unpaid.  He said the 4 billion ruble (approx. 
$160 million) difference between the revenues and payments of 
the proceedings was for expenses and fees for lawyers, 
consultants, accountants, etc.  (N.B. Rebgun did not clarify 
how much of that was fees paid to him.) 
 
--------------------------------------- 
"JUST CARRYING OUT A VALID COURT ORDER" 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Rebgun cited his experience as a prominent 
consultant to a variety of international companies and banks, 
including experience with other bankruptcies, as the reason 
he was appointed to manage this high-profile bankruptcy. 
Separating his role from the decisions that brought Yukos 
down, Rebgun emphasized that he was "just carrying out a 
valid court order."  "If someone has a problem with the court 
decision on Yukos back-taxes or the court decision declaring 
Yukos bankrupt, they need to take that up with the courts." 
He added that he is not qualified to judge the court 
decisions because he does not know the facts, but said he 
trusts that Russian law was carried out properly. 
 
---------------------------------- 
YUKOS FINANCE "IS LYNCH'S PROBLEM" 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Rebgun said he believes the October 31st Dutch court 
ruling that challenged his authority to auction off a 
Netherlands-based Yukos asset, Yukos Finance, is wrong and he 
is appealing.  However, he said his motives were a matter of 
principle, and because he is a "warrior," not because there 
is any legal consequence for him.  (Note:  The ruling 
effectively gave control of Yukos Finance to its former 
directors.  Monte Valle, a company owned by American Steven 
Lynch and backed by Moscow- and Cyprus-based Renaissance 
Capital, had bought Yukos Finance at auction for about $300 
million.  The Dutch court ruling casts doubt over the 
ownership of this asset, which includes a 49% stake in 
Slovakia's oil pipeline company, Transpetrol -- see reftel. 
End note.) 
 
¶6. (SBU) Rebgun said there is no provision to repay Monte 
Valle should it not be able to gain control of Yukos Finance. 
 "They knew quite well what they were buying," he said, 
referring to the risks involved.  "This is Lynch's problem." 
He added, however, that he would, "as a professional, help 
Lynch with the case if he asks for it."  He suggested Yukos 
Finance could be tied up in the courts for years.  Rebgun 
also downplayed the significance of the case, noting that the 
$300 million paid for the company was less than 1 percent of 
the bankruptcy proceeds.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7. (C) Rebgun is probably correct in calling the Yukos saga 
over, certainly with respect to its existence in Russia. 
That doesn't preclude continuing challenges in international 
courts.  However, those challenges will ultimately deal with 
minor issues, like Yukos Finance.  Any attempt to revive the 
company or reverse Russian court decisions would almost 
certainly be doomed to failure.
