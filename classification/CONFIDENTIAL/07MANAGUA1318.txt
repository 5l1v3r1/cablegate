SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER DOWNPLAYS GON ENDORSEMENT OF 
NORTH KOREA,S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli.  Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) On May 21, the Ambassador raised with Foreign 
Minister Samuel Santos the Nicaraguan government's (GON) 
position vis a vis North Korea (DPRK), specifically noting 
our concern over President Ortega's recent public remarks 
virtually endorsing the DPRK's efforts to become a nuclear 
power, a position that does not help facilitate the ongoing 
Six-Party Talks (remarks faxed to desk on 23 May).  The 
Ambassador referred to President Ortega's declaration that, 
"some (countries) arm themselves, but want to prohibit others 
from arming themselves in self-defense.  This is not correct, 
this is not fair," in clear allusion to the DPRK's nuclear 
arms race.  Foreign Minister Santos replied that President 
Ortega had merely recognized North Korea's right to defend 
itself.  He then proceeded to lambaste the media for 
reporting only part of Ortega's remarks, leaving out the 
President's comments "in support of the Six-Party Talks." 
 
¶2.  (C) Comment: The GON recently upgraded its diplomatic 
ties with North Korea, accrediting North Korean Ambassador 
Jae Myong So on May 16 and hosting the DPRK's Deputy Foreign 
Minister Kim Hyong Jun in his three-day visit to Managua. 
During the Bolanos administration, Nicaragua's Ambassador in 
Tokyo covered North Korea, and North Korea did not maintain 
an embassy in Managua.  We understand the North Koreans are 
establishing an embassy here, but according to the Foreign 
Ministry's Americas director, Nicaragua will not open an 
embassy in Pyongyang because of cost constraints.  He stated 
that Nicaragua's embassy in Tokyo will continue covering 
North Korea. 
 
¶3.  (C) President Ortega's unhelpful endorsement of North 
Korea's nuclear arms ambitions typifies his increasingly 
frequent anti-U.S., pro-Venezuela, pro-rogue-state rhetoric. 
In essence, friends of Venezuela -- including North Korea, 
Iran, and Belarus -- are automatically Nicaragua's allies and 
must be supported publicly.  On May 19, Ortega and Kim Hyon 
Jun committed their countries to support each other in 
international fora and to "cooperate in all fields."  While 
it is true that during the accreditation ceremony Ortega 
remarked that Jae Myong So had informed him of North Korea's 
talks with China, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and the United 
States, he did not endorse these talks, preferring instead to 
lend Nicaragua's support for North Korea's arms race -- a 
statement that would understandably be picked up by the 
media.  The Japanese Ambassador told the Ambassador privately 
that he is "deeply concerned" by Ortega's remarks and the 
upgrading of DPRK relations.
