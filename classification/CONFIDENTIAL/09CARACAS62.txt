Charge clarified that he attended a private wedding and did not meet with opposition politicians in Puerto Rico. Charge urged the GBRV to raise any concerns with the USG directly before making accusations in the media. Maduro took on board the Charge's explanation and said it tracked with positive "messages" from the State Department. He said the GBRV would proceed with its investigation with due "seriousness." Charge also noted that he still hoped to resolve bilateral reciprocity issues, andMaduro instructed his Chief of Staff to follow up on such issues during the week of January 19. End Summary.

Charge's Visit to Puerto Rico
-----------------------------

¶2. (C) A relaxed and courteous Foreign Minister Maduro, accompanied by his Chief of Staff TemirPorras, met briefly in his office with the Charge' and A/PolCouns the afternoon of January 15. Maduro opened the meeting by noting that the political opposition in Venezuela "talks too much" and acts along the "border of legality and illegality." He expressed concern at the "strange coincidence" between the Charge's recent visit to Puerto Rico and the visit of some opposition leaders there at the same time. Maduro noted that he had received some positive "messages" from the State Department, but nevertheless, he was following up on President Chavez's request that he ask the Charge' for his side of the story.

¶3. (C) The Charge clarified that he traveled to Puerto Rico to attend the wedding of two friends and noted that he did not meet with the opposition leaders there. He said he was surprised by the accusations of GBRV officials that he was in Puerto Rico to strategize with opposition leaders against President Chavez's proposed amendment to eliminate term limits for all elected offices (Reftel). He also noted that he knows the opposition leaders and does, per normal diplomatic practice, meet openly with government and opposition members in Venezuela. The Charge added that he is committed to trying to resolve bilateral issues, rather than provoke controversies.

¶4. (C) Maduro stressed that the GBRV wanted to avoid controversies. Charge responded that the GBRV could help by improving communication with the USG. He cited the communication between Chief of Staff Porras and the Charge in the fall that publicly clarified the status of the Venezuelan Consulate in Houston as an example of how both governments could work together to reduce misunderstandings. Maduro concurred and named Porras as a point of contact. He also said that he wanted to have a more regular bilateral relationship, adding that our differences on many international issues complicate such efforts, but suggested progress could be made. He pledged that the GBRV would "process" the Puerto Rico controversy with "seriousness" as well as try to improve bilateral relations with "good will" and "intelligence."

------------------
Reciprocity Issues
------------------

¶5. (C) Charge underscored that the USG remains concerned about reciprocity issues, including ongoing Embassy problems visas, vehicles, and value-added tax reimbursement. He noted that these problems appear to constitute GBRV harassment of Embassy operations and personnel.Washington has been sharing these concerns with the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington. Maduro responded by instructing Porras to meet with the Charge' the week of January 19 to try to resolve pending administrative problems. On the way out of the meeting, Porras suggested a January 21 meeting.

¶6. (SBU) On the way out of the Foreign Ministry, a large contingent of local press asked the Charge to comment on his meeting. He told the gathered press that the meeting was a good opportunity to open a new bilateral dialogue and that he appreciated the invitation by the Foreign Minister. When asked about his recent trip to Puerto Rico, Charge repeated what he had told the press the previous day -- that the trip was merely to attend a wedding. The Charge added that it was his understanding that this issue had been overcome.
