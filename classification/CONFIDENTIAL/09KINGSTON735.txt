SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS 
 
-------------------- 
 
 
 
 ¶1. (C) Trevor Alleyne, Division Chief and head of the a six-person 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation to Jamaica, said the 
Government of Jamaica (GOJ) appears to have a "clarity of purpose" 
in regard to current negotiations for a Standby Agreement.  Alleyne 
met with Emboffs on November 5 to discuss the status of two weeks 
of negotiations that end November 6, and added that the mood has 
changed since his last visit in June (Reftel A). Alleyne said all 
options are still on the table and the IMF wants to "think 
creatively" in regard to its strategy with the GOJ.   Alleyne spoke 
more openly about measures that needed to be taken in Jamaica to 
address the economic fundamentals and in particular the significant 
debt challenges facing the country, during a meeting in June with 
Emboffs; in this meeting he was more tight lipped.  It has been an 
eventful two weeks for the IMF team as: the Governor of the Bank of 
Jamaica, Derick Latibeaudiere, was dismissed; Hardley Lewin, the 
well-respected Commissioner of police, resigned; and the Standard 
and Poor's rating agency downgraded Jamaica to CCC.  The GOJ 
appears to have worked out some of the key obstacles to an IMF 
deal, but they will need to move quickly to calm a high level of 
uncertainty in the private sector.  Deep and fundamental reform is 
needed in Jamaica, but it is still not clear if the Jamaica Labor 
Party (JLP)-led government has the political will to implement such 
sweeping changes.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
Progress Continues, But USD 1.2 Billion Figure Not Precise 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
 
 
¶2. (C) Alleyne said that the negotiations were progressing and he 
is hopeful that a staff-level agreement may exist by the end of the 
year.  However, a final agreement would not have IMF board approval 
until early 2010. Despite numerous public assertions by GOJ 
representatives that the IMF deal would be worth USD 1.2 billion, 
Alleyne responded in surprise to an exact figure being attached to 
the deal, adding he was not even sure where this figure had 
originated. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (C) Alleyne explained that Jamaica could conceivably receive a 
program that is equal to 600 percent of its USD 300 million quota, 
but that would be the maximum for the life of the program.  He also 
explained that the maximum the IMF could provide in one year is 200 
percent of the 300 million quota, thus, a total of USD 600 million. 
He said the IMF is looking at governance issues including a fiscal 
responsibility framework, a measure that already has being 
discussed by the GOJ.  Such measures would include provisions to 
cap the fiscal deficit and the debt-to-GDP ratio.  Jamaica 
continues to use supplemental budgets to increase expenditures 
beyond those budgeted annually, suggesting a high level of 
discretionary spending. 
 
 
 
Central Bank Governor Dismissal, Issue of Liability Management 
Program 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
 
¶4.  (C)  Alleyne asserted that the IMF and the GOJ continue to make 
progress in their talks and the two sides are narrowing their 
differences.  He explained that most of the divergences are now at 
the technical level, as both parties appear to be in agreement on 
the policy direction.  He would not elaborate on the status of debt 
restructuring, an area in which Emboffs were told by Ministry of 
Finance and Public Service (MFPS) officials on October 28, was a 
key sticking point in the talks.  Alleyne said that any deal would 
include involvement from the other multilaterals.  COMMENT: It 
might be possible that the IMF will work with other multilaterals 
to support a debt refinancing deal that would allow Jamaica to 
avoid default.  END COMMENT.  It is worth noting that the 
Emboffs-MFPS meeting was prior to the October 30 dismissal of 
Latibeaudiere, who was vehemently opposed to any form of debt 
restructuring.  Alleyne said Latibeaudiere's departure did not 
disrupt negotiations, but he would not elaborate on whether or not 
the former Governor had been a road block to progress.  (NOTE: 
Emboff contacts at the MFPS have confirmed that Latibeaudiere 
single-handily killed prior attempts to implement a liability 
management program to address the debt problem  (Reftel B).  In a 
move to reassure the nation and the markets after the dismissal of 
Latibeaudiere, Prime Minister (PM) Bruce Golding in a speech to 
Parliament on November 2 assured the nation that his departure will 
not disturb current negotiations. 
 
 
 
Deep and Fundamental Reform Needed 
 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶5. (C) Alleyne raised concerns about the GOJ's granting of 
government guarantees for major infrastructure projects.  He 
specifically referenced the planned expansion of the PetroJam 
refinery in Kingston (NOTE: The refinery is 51 percent owned by the 
GOJ and 49 percent owned by PDVSA the Venezuelan Government-owned 
oil company) and the proposed liquid natural gas project being 
advocated by the GOJ.  These arrangements would conflict with the 
IMF's desire to reduce the GOJ's level of contingent liabilities 
which have a history of being absorbed by the GOJ as new debt. 
(Reftel B).  Alleyne's view was supported in a speech on November 4 
by respected business leader and former Minister in the MFPS Don 
Wehby, who said the GOJ must control public sector expenditures, 
particularly its loss making parastatals including beleaguered 
airline Air Jamaica and the former sugar estates.  Wehby said the 
GOJ can no longer afford to keep making minor tweaks to its system, 
but must embark on deep and fundamental reforms.  COMMENT:  The GOJ 
appears unwilling to extract itself from major investment projects, 
even when there are willing and capable private sector investors -- 
perhaps to maintain influence in operations and in some instances 
to extract economic rent.  END COMMENT. 
 
 
 
COMMENT AND ANALYSIS 
 
--------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶6. (C) Even if the IMF is willing to entertain novel approaches to 
assist Jamaica, the Jamaican Labour Party (JLP)-led GOJ must 
demonstrate a level of leadership and political will to make 
difficult decisions, which for the past two years seems to have 
eluded them.  The private sector is holding its breath for a sign 
that the IMF deal will go through.  At the same time crime appears 
unmanageable and investor confidence is falling.  Time is of the 
essence for the JLP, but is not clear if the JLP leadership has the 
fortitude to embark on the type of deep reform that is needed to 
give Jamaica the breathing space it needs to move through the 
current crisis and eventually be able to derive benefits in a 
future global recovery.  End Comment and Analysis.
