SUBJECT: LEBANON: UNSC 1701 DEMARCHE DELIVERED

REF: SECSTATE 132517

Classified By: Ambassador James C. Oberwetter for reasons 1.4 (b) and (
d).

Â¶1. (C) Ambassador Oberwetter delivered the text of UNSC 1701
to FM Saud al-Faisal on August 15. The FM said that the most
recent statements from the Israeli government and Hizballah
"do not bode well for the future" and he cast his doubts on
the ceasefire lasting. He said that disarming Hizballah and
deploying a more robust UNIFIL force would be difficult. The
FM also said that the Lebanese people, particularly the Shia,
are deeply angered by the level of destruction and the need
to re-build their country. He said that Nasrallah's pledge
to re-build Lebanon could only be achieved through Iranian
support. Finally, the FM referenced his recent telephone
call to Secretary Rice, and he told the Ambassador that
Secretary Rice "handled the resolution deftly."
