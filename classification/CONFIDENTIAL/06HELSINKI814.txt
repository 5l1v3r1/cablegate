(C) MFA Human Rights Unit Director Johanna Suurpaa 
acknowledged Professor Wedgwood's high qualifications for the 
post and her outstanding performance during her first term on 
the UN Human Rights Committee when emboff discussed reftel 
information with her August 15.  Noting that Finland had 
backed Prof. Wedgwood's initial election to the committee, 
Suurpaa was "not pessimistic" that Finland would again vote 
for the U.S. candidate, but could not make any commitments. 
Suurpaa explained that since the candidate list often changes 
in the days before the election, Helsinki would not make its 
choice from among the many well-qualified candidates until 
just before the election on September 7.
