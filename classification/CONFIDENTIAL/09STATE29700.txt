RELATIONS FERRARO-WALDNER TO RAISE CASE OF GAO ZHISHENG 
WITH THE CHINESE 
 
REF: BRUSSELS 000414

Classified By: DRL Karen Stewart for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)

¶1. (U) This is an action request. See paragraph 3.

¶2. (C) The Department thanks Post for discussing the case
of missing Chinese human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng with
Michalis Rokas, Deputy Director for China at the European
Commission. Mr. Gao has not been seen or heard from since he
was removed from his family´s home by police on February 4.
We are deeply concerned about his well-being and whereabouts,
particularly in light of his claim that he was tortured while
in custody in 2007. We understand that Post learned from Mr.
Rokas that the European Commissioner for External Relations
Benita Ferraro-Waldner is considering raising Mr. Gao´s case
during her trip to China the week of March 30.

¶3. (C) Action request: Department requests that Post
contact Commissioner Ferraro-Waldner prior to her departure
for China to encourage her to raise Mr. Gao´s case during her
high level discussions with Chinese officials. Advise her
that Charge Dan Piccuta at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing raise
Gao´s case with officials at China´s Ministry of Foreign
Affairs on March 23. While making clear to the Commissioner
that we do not wish her to raise concerns about Mr. Gao´s´s
case on the USG´s behalf, express our belief that it would be
helpful for the EU to add its own expression of concern to
ours and those of others in the international community and
press for Mr. Gao´s release. It would be particularly useful
if the Commissioner could request information on Gao´s
condition and whereabouts and impress upon China´s leaders
the importance of treating Mr. Gao in a transparent and
humane manner, in accordance with international norms.
