SUBJECT: NODEL KIRK TAKES UP SECURITY ISSUES AND VISA
PROGRAM DURING MEXICO VISIT
Classified By: Charge John Feeley. Reason: 1.4 (b), (d).

¶1. (C) Summary:  Representative Mark Kirk (R-IL) and two
staff members discussed the Merida Initiative (MI), law
enforcement efforts, and human rights with President Felipe
Calderon and Public Security Minister Genaro Garcia Luna
during their visit to Guadalajara and Mexico City June
29-July 2, 2009.  They also visited the small towns of La Luz
in Michoacan and Tonatico in the State of Mexico to meet with
local officials and participants about the "Abuelita" visa
program.  Kirk offered President Calderon several suggestions
to shape discussions on the Merida Initiative and human
rights topics during the POTUS visit in Guadalajara next
month.  Secretary Garcia Luna briefed the Congressman on law
enforcement efforts in Mexico.  Representative Kirk also
reached agreement with the consular sections in the Embassy
and the Consulate in Guadalajara on implementation of the
Abuelita program.  End Summary.

Building a Stronger Case for the Merida Initiative

¶2. (C) In his meeting with Mexican President Felipe Calderon
and Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa July 2, Rep. Mark
Steven Kirk (R-10th District IL) urged the Government of
Mexico (GOM) to dedicate more time and attention to
publicizing its successes.  This would help convince the U.S.
Congress that Mexico is winning the war against organized
crime.  Kirk also told Calderon that, while there is strong
support for the Merida Initiative in the House of
Representatives, support in the Senate is less secure.  In
discussing the best approach to take in addressing MI during
his upcoming August meeting with President Obama in
Guadalajara, Kirk maintained that the GOM would be
well-advised to dedicate more attention to the promotion of
human rights, including by reaching out to and working
closely with Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.
The Charge also encouraged the GOM to be more forthcoming
with information about developments in human rights cases
involving the military and law enforcement personnel as this
would enable us to better deal with Merida skeptics on the
Hill to ensure full delivery of appropriated funding.

¶3. (C) Calderon remarked that Mexico was essentially a victim
of its success in combating organized crime.  With the steady
stream of arrests and seizures, the Mexican public was
becoming less impressed with the government's record of
achievement.  Calderon affirmed his government's respect for
human rights and said that he found Kirk's suggestion to work
more closely with human rights NGOs helpful.

¶4. (C) In his meeting with Secretary of Public Security
Genaro Garcia Luna and his advisors on July 1, Kirk outlined
the current state of play in the U.S. Congress.  Garcia Luna
played down the role of the military in the fight against
organized crime, claiming that there were fewer troops
deployed now than when the Calderon administration took
office.  (Note:  A Mexican Foreign Ministry official conceded
this was patently false.  End Note.)  Separately, Garcia Luna
asserted that crimes committed by the military were tried in
civilian courts as a rule when in fact this has only occurred
in one instance.  Garcia Luna also provided Kirk with a
detailed description of his Secretariat's plans for
developing its own abilities to assume the lead on the
government's law enforcement campaign against organized
crime.

Guess Who,s Coming to Chicago?

¶5. (SBU) Kirk also briefed Calderon on his "Abuelita"
("Grandmother") program.  Kirk advised Calderon that upwards
of 20,000 of his constituents in Chicago had left behind
close relatives from the states of Mexico and Michoacan.
Kirk was particularly sensitive to these constituents' desire
to have their grandparents visit the U.S.  Under this
program, Kirk seeks to facilitate U.S. visa issuance to the
grandparents of constituents in his district.  These
applicants apply as a group and thus far, according to Kirk,
there has been a 100 percent return rate.  Calderon applauded
Kirk,s initiative in developing the program.

¶6. (U) In the course of his visit, Kirk also took the
opportunity to meet with Consulate and Embassy staff to
further discuss the Abuelita program and efforts to combat
organized crime.  He also met separately with the executive
director of Mexfam A.C.  Kirk was pleased with Mission
Mexico,s support for the Abuelita program.

¶7. (U) Congressman Kirk did not have an opportunity to clear
this message before he departed post.
