INFORMATION 

Classified By: Ambassador William R. Brownfield 
Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 

SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (C) Defense Minister Santos told the Ambassador on May 5 
that the GOC appreciated U.S. efforts to safeguard 
information in the Raul Reyes computers.  He said V/MOD 
Jaramillio is managing the GOC strategy to release the Reyes 
data, and is privately briefing select governments on the 
files.  Once Interpol "certifies" the integrity of the Reyes' 
computers, the GOC plans to release most of the information, 
possibly to independent academics in Colombia, Europe, the 
United States or Canada.  The GOC will withhold some 
information on Venezuela and Ecuador to use as leverage 
later.  The Ambassador encouraged Santos to consider how the 
Reyes information will be integrated into the GOC's larger 
public diplomacy, media, political, and military efforts. 
Santos asked us to coordinate with Jaramillo on that effort. 
End Summary 

¶2. (C) The Ambassador met privately with Defense Minister 
Santos on May 5 and noted that it had been nine weeks since 
the seizure of the Raul Reyes computers in his Ecuador camp. 
The Ambassador told Santos there is growing interest in 
Washington on what the GOC plans to do with the information 
in the computers, how it intends to do it, and whether the 
GOC has a comprehensive, integrated strategy.  He added that 
we had not violated in any way their request not to release 
publicly contents of the computers without first consulting 
with the GOC. 

¶3. (C) Santos said he appreciated U.S. efforts to safeguard 
the information, and told us he had asked President Uribe in 
April for guidance on exploiting the computers.  Uribe 
authorized him to manage the process from the Defense 
Ministry.  Santos said he gave the job to Vice MOD Sergio 
Jaramillo, subject to Santos' concurrence with all 
operational decisions. 

¶4. (C) Santos outlined the GOC plan as follows: 

-- The GOC will wait for Interpol's "certification" that the 
computers have not been tampered with before releasing 
publicly any data.  They expect that certification by 
mid-May.  All signals they have received indicate Interpol 
will say there is no evidence the computers have been altered; 

--While waiting for Interpol action, V/MOD Jaramillo is 
providing specific Reyes' messages to selected media in 
Colombia, South America, North America, and Europe; 

--The releases are tied to specific themes:  FARC and Chavez, 
FARC and Correa, FARC and drugs.  The releases are not 
attributable to the GOC; 

--Jaramillo travels every week to brief select governments. 
He has already briefed the Mexicans and the Brazilians.  He 
will brief the Chileans the week of May 5.  Jaramillo plans 
to travel to Europe to brief UK, Spain, and maybe France 
later in May.  Santos said both Mexico and Brazil seemed to 
be impressed with the material briefed to them; 

--Once Interpol issues its assurances, Santos said the GOC 
intends to release most of the data to a public source.  The 
GOC will withhold selected data that might provide useful 
leverage with the Venezuelan or Ecuadorian Governments in the 
future.  It will also retain some material that could create 
legal issues in Colombia were it to be released by the GOC. 
Still, Santos said he intends to release most of the computer 
data in a transparent manner; 

--The GOC is considering releasing the material to academics, 
perhaps one in Colombia, another in Europe, and a third in 
the U.S. or Canada--but has not reached a final decision. 

The idea would be to put it in the hands of respected 
independent actors who could respond to challenges from 
elsewhere in academia as to the validity and authenticity of 
the data. 

¶5. (C)  The Ambassador asked whether the GOC has developed a 
plan to integrate the material, and its release, into a 
broader public diplomacy, media, political, and military 
strategy.  Santos said V/MOD Jaramillo is doing that, and 
suggested that we reach out to Jaramillo to discuss the 
broader strategic implications of the computer data.
