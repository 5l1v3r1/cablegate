(C)  On July 5 we delivered reftel points to MFA Deputy 
Director General for Global Security and Bilateral Relations 
Leif Larsen, who will share the information with MFA 
colleagues in the Middle East and Export Control sections. 
He noted Norway's stringent export regulations which prohibit 
providing material to countries in war, or where conflict is 
threatened.  Larsen also opined that, even if Norway could 
provide the requested ammunition, it would be impossible to 
deliver such ammunition in the aggressive deadline outlined 
under the reftel points.  DATT has separately raised this 
matter with MOD colleagues.
