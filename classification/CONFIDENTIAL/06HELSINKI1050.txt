SUBJECT: EU PRESIDENCY WAITING FOR UNSC ACTION ON NORTH 
KOREA 
 
REF: STATE 169418 
 
Classified By: POLOFF David Schlaefer for reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (U) PolOff met with Foreign Ministry Director for Asia 
Pekka Metso and North Korea Desk Officer Jari Sinkkari 
Oct. 12 to discuss reftel.  Metso had not yet seen reftel 
due to official travel but Sinkkari had received it prior 
to the meeting. 
 
ALL EYES ON THE UNSC 
-------------------- 
¶2. (C) Sinkkari believes that the most useful role the EU 
can play is to amplify whatever message emanates from the 
Security Council, because the EU is not a member of the Six 
Party format.  The EU's ties to North Korea are limited to 
humanitarian aid and KEDO; Metso considers both of these 
initiatives off-limits from possible sanctions.  He drew a 
distinction between the EU's positions on North Korea and 
Iran, pointing to the EU's long-standing ties to the Middle 
East as opposed to its relative lack of leverage with 
Pyongyang.  Metso expressed hope that the UNSC would reach 
a conclusion "sooner rather than later" regarding the text 
of a resolution on North Korea as the EU hopes to become 
politically and substantively involved. 
 
¶3. (C) Metso is looking toward his consultations in 
Washington Oct. 23-24 with Assistant Secretary Boucher and 
Deputy Assistant Secretary Stephens regarding North Korea. 
Metso discussed the "5 plus 5" format developed in Kuala 
Lumpur but expressed concern that the meeting on the 
margins of the UN General Assembly was "5 plus 5 minus 2." 
Metso hopes that his consultations in Washington will 
include discussion of the future of the "5 plus 5" format 
or whether it is time for something "completely different." 
 
¶4. (C) Metso explained the EU presidency statement on North 
Korea as having been drafted as a quick response to the 
nuclear test because the Presidency wanted to avoid the 24- 
hour wait necessary for full EU coordination.  An EU 
statement, representing the views of all member states was 
possible, but not before the UNSC acts. 
 
ANALYZING THE DRAGON AND THE BEAR 
--------------------------------- 
¶5. (C) Metso stated that the EU was pleased with the swift, 
strong statement issued by China immediately following the 
North Korean nuclear test.  He believed that the timing of 
the test, the day after Japanese PM Abe had met with 
Chinese Premier Wen and the two had issued a joint 
statement condemning any North Korean nuclear test, was a 
blow to Chinese diplomacy in the region and a source of 
embarrassment. 
 
¶6. (C) The Russian position, by contrast, was much more 
difficult to predict and measure.  Metso believes that 
Russia is aggressively using its energy influence in 
the region to extract concessions for every 'good deed' 
and that economic decision-making is driving the 
Russian response.  He described the Russian position as 
"blurred" and a "question mark." 
 
¶7. Comment: (C) Given the EU's limited leverage and 
presence in the region, the Finns are clearly looking to 
Washington for input on how the EU can best calibrate its 
response and play an effective and complementary role in 
the current crisis.  The GoF is also concerned that Russian 
maneuvering may be exacerbated by high-level distraction 
over the Politkovskaya affair.  As the situation in the 
UNSC becomes clearer, Finland will be prepared to use its 
role as EU President to augment the international 
community's response.
