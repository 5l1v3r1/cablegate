SUBJECT: MACEDONIA: DUI LEADER AHMETI OPPOSES NAME ISSUE 
 
REFERENDUM, WOULD BOYCOTT EARLY ELECTIONS 
 
REF: A. SKOPJE 525 
     ¶B. SKOPJE 356 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR PHILIP REEKER FOR REASONS 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: During meetings on October 26 and November 1, 
ethnic-Albanian coalition party leader Ali Ahmeti and 
Ambassador Reeker discussed PM Nikola Gruevski's recent trip 
to Brussels and his meeting with new Greek PM Papandreou. 
Ahmeti noted that the PM seemed to have a renewed openness to 
solving the name issue but was still hung up on the same 
obstacles.  Ahmeti generally opposed the idea of a referendum 
on the name issue but insisted that if necessary, the 
language of any proposed referendum must have broad support. 
Ahmeti again declared that his party and ethnic Macedonian 
opposition party SDSM had agreed to boycott early 
parliamentary elections should they be called.  He also said 
that the parliamentary group investigating the Sopot case 
would ask for the case to be retried and believed his party 
and VMRO-DPMNE were close to agreeing on a social package for 
the former NLA fighters. (End Summary) 
 
¶2. (C) Ahmeti positively noted PM Gruevski's apparently 
renewed determination to address the name dispute with Greece 
following the PM's recent trip to Brussels and October 29 
meeting with new Greek PM George Papandreou (ref a). 
However, added Ahmeti, PM Gruevski is still hung up on the 
same obstacles regarding identity, geographical identifiers, 
and bilateral versus multilateral use of the name.  Ahmeti 
also feels the PM's insistence on a referendum is unnecessary 
and stems from the PM's fear of his own (ethnic Macedonian) 
constituency.  Ahmeti believes the PM does not have the 
courage to lead Macedonia to a resolution of the name issue 
without first establishing public consent through a 
referendum.  However, if a referendum were proposed, Ahmeti 
indicated that his party would only be willing to support it 
if the language of the referendum received broad approval 
from all the major political parties in parliament. 
 
¶3. (C) According to Ahmeti, former PM and President and 
current opposition party leader, Branko Crvenkovski, claimed 
to have reliable information that early parliamentary 
elections were being planned and asked Ahmeti if those rumors 
were true.  Ahmeti said the owner of the A1 media outlet, 
Velija Ramkovski, was Crvenkovski's source and Ahmeti did not 
consider him reliable.  Ahmeti indicated that he was not 
aware of any plans for early elections, pointing out that 
elections would not make sense given the GoM's lack of 
achievements thus far.  Without resolution of the name issue, 
tangible Euro-Atlantic accession progress and a continued 
lack of implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, the 
government had nothing to campaign on.  Ahmeti-- reiterating 
declarations from a previous meeting (ref b)-- said that he 
and Crvenkovski had agreed that their parties would boycott 
early elections.  If Macedonia solved the name issue and got 
into NATO, Ahmeti joked that he would call for early 
elections himself.  Ahmeti also pointed out that 
Crvenkovski's party was currently too weak for elections. 
(Comment: Gruevski has told Ambassador that he has no/no 
plans for early elections.  End comment.) 
 
¶4. (C) Ahmeti said the special parliamentary group 
investigating the Sopot case had experienced substantial 
difficulty obtaining information about the case from most of 
the government bodies from which it had requested 
information.  (Background: the Sopot case was a controversial 
case in which eleven ethnic Albanians were convicted to a 
combined 156 years in prison, based primarily on the 
testimony of one witness (who later recanted), for allegedly 
planting a mine that that killed two NATO soldiers and 
injured an interpreter in 2003.) Nonetheless, based on the 
limited information the parliamentary group had received, 
Ahmeti believed the group would ultimately determine that 
human rights violations were committed in the detention and 
questioning of the main witness and would request a retrial 
of the case.  (Note- The court is under no obligation to 
submit to the recommendations of the parliamentary group.) 
 
¶5. (C) Ahmeti believes the GoM is close to coming to terms on 
a social support package for the former National Liberation 
Army (NLA) fighters and their families.  Ahmeti said the 
proposed package is within the terms of the May 29th 
agreement-- which ended DUI's boycott of parliament in 2007-- 
and conforms to Macedonia's laws.  Ahmeti said his party had 
prepared three variants of the social package and ultimately 
expected the version granting the lowest social support would 
be accepted, but DUI would be comfortable with that result. 
Ahmeti believed that his party had reached an understanding 
with the PM on the NLA social package and it would only be a 
matter of time until the package was passed into law. 
(Comment: The social package continues to play prominently in 
the press; it is not 100% clear that there is real agreement 
on the way forward. (End Comment))
