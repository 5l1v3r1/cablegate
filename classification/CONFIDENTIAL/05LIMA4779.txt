Classified By: D/Polcouns Art Muirhead for Reason 1.4 (B, D) 	

¶1. (C) During an 11/7 phone call initiated by President Toledo about another matter, Ambassador asked the President what he thought Fujimori's game plan was.  Toledo said that it was ""sophisticated and complex.""  (COMMENT: This may be another way of saying he did not yet feel he had fully figured it out.  END COMMENT.)  Toledo said Fujimori's strategy was to get the various charges against him reduced to something that would carry a sentence of two years. Toledo also bemoaned the fact that Fujimori had bought influence in Japan and Chile. 

¶2. (C) In other developments related to Fujimori, D/Polcouns spoke on 11/7 with Chilean Political Officer Fernando Velasco (protect) a few minutes after the latter's meeting with 	Japanese Embassy officials here.  Velasco said the Japanese were extremely relieved that they are no longer the focus of the GOP's attention regarding Fujimori.  The Japanese officials said that the GOJ intended to adopt an extremely low profile with respect to Fujimori's presence in Santiago. The GOJ will provide consular assistance as requested according to Japanese law, but they do not want this to take on a political dimension in their relations with either Chile 	or Peru. 

¶3. (U) Congressman Gustavo Pacheco, who is Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, announced that he would hold hearings on the Fujimori situation in the near future, and would require testimony from Foreign Minister Maurtua, Justice Minister Tudela, Interior Minister Pizarro, and Anti-Corruption State's Attorney Maldonado.  Pacheco said he has requested that the Congress vote to authorize a trip to Santiago by the Foreign Relations Committee, so that the Peruvian Congressmen can inform their Chilean counterparts about the crimes Fujimori is accused of committing in Peru. 

¶4. (U) Members of Fujimori's Si Cumple Party and union members from the Peruvian Workers Confederation (CTP), which opposes the former President, were involved in a confrontation in front of the Chilean Ambassador's residence 	which resulted in several fist fights.  Police officers at the scene were able to quickly separate the two groups and 	restore order.
