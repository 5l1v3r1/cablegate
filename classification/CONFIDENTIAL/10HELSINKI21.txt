(C) Charg raised reftel points on January 15 with Finnish 
Special Envoy for Afghanistan Elina Kalkku.  Kalkku related 
that she had met earlier in the day with the UK AMB and that 
the GOF was in complete agreement regarding underlining the 
difference between province-by-province transition of 
security responsibility to Afghan forces and the completion 
of ISAF's mission.  She thought it would be important for the 
distinction to be made in the written conclusions of the 
London Conference and she undertook to spread the message in 
the Finnish media post-London. 
 
(C) Moving on to Finland's contributions in Afghanistan, 
Kalkku predicted that the Cabinet Committee on Foreign and 
Security Policy, to meet January 22, would approve increases 
in military, civilian, and financial contributions.  While 
"not everything we wanted", this would be a "better than 
expected" result.  NOTE: Post understands that in a January 
12 luncheon for EU Chiefs of Mission FM Stubb stated his own 
desire for across the board increases in Finnish 
contributions in Afghanistan, including military, diplomatic, 
and development involvement. END NOTE.  Kalkku also revealed 
that the MFA was planning to double the size of its embassy 
in Kabul (we understand there are about three diplomats there 
now who focus on development), feeling the need for more 
political and military reporting.  Kalkku and Security Policy 
and Crisis Management Unit Director Timo Kantola will conduct 
a backgrounder with Finnish press on Monday afternoon but 
will not be making any new announcements.
