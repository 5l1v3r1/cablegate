Panama:  Doubt Uighur Detainees Position Changed 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶1.  (C) Panamanian First VP and FM Samuel Lewis undertook on 
July 11 to check to see if Panama's position regarding 
acceptance of Uighur detainees from Guantanamo had changed; 
"I doubt that it has."  Lewis made these comments in response 
Ambassador's delivery of REFTEL A demarche.  Lewis, who 
departed Panama for Brazil on July 12, promised to provide a 
more definitive response.

Comment

¶2.  (C) Post assesses that Panama is highly unlikely to 
accept Uighur detainees from Guantanamo.  As reported REFTEL 
B, Panama has serious concerns about its ability, as a small 
country, to integrate and support refugees, particularly 
Uighur detainees that do not have any community in Panama 
upon which they can rely.  More fundamentally, Panama, in 
general and under the Torrijos Administration in particular, 
is loathe to accept refugees.  Post will follow up with Lewis 
to press our case and to secure a more considered response.
