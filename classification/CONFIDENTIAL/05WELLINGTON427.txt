SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND POLICIES AND ACTIONS TAKEN WITH REGARD 
TO CUBA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 96300 
 
Classified By: POL/ECON COUNSELOR KATHERINE HADDA, 
FOR REASONS 1.4 (B, D) 
 
¶1.  (C) The Government of New Zealand formalized diplomatic 
relations with Cuba in 2001, with its Ambassador resident in 
Mexico City accredited to Havana.  Cuba's Ambassador to New 
Zealand is resident in Jakarta and cross-accredited to 
Wellington.  According to Mike Shaw, Policy Officer, Americas 
Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, no 
significant change occurred in the diplomatic relationship 
between New Zealand and Cuba during the past year. 
 
¶2.  (C) Shaw said that the GoNZ uses meetings with Cuban 
officials to "express its concern over the human rights 
situation in Cuba, and encourage moves towards 
democratization and the promotion of human rights.  These 
include the proper treatment of those who hold political 
views in opposition to the Cuban government."  This is 
consistent with the GoNZ's policy of engagement with states 
that have poor human rights records, he added. 
 
¶3.  (C) Post is unaware of any NZ entity or national who 
would be subject to Title III of the LIBERTAD Act.  The GoNZ 
would strenuously object to any effort to apply Title III to 
a NZ entity or national on extraterritoriality grounds. 
While the GoNZ has not historically co-sponsored Cuba-related 
resolutions at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and is not 
presently a member of the Commission, it is strongly 
supportive of the U.S. positions regarding Cuba's human 
rights record.  Use of Title III would jeopardize continued 
good-faith cooperation. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Economically, no substantive change has developed 
regarding New Zealand's trade and investment with Cuba during 
the past year.  In calendar year 2004, New Zealand's exports 
to Cuba totaled NZD 80.9 million (USD 57.6 million) and 
imports totaled NZD 1.08 million (USD 768,700.)  As in 2003, 
97 percent of total exports were in the dairy sector, 
specifically powdered milk purchased by the Cuban government 
primarily for its "milk in schools" program.
