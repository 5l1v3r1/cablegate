Classified By: DCM Michael Butler for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
 (C) DCM delivered demarche on Turkey's accession to MFA 
Acting Political Director Anu Laamanen on July 28.  Laamanen 
noted Finland's long-standing support for Turkish EU 
membership, and added that she expects a creative result on 
the AKP court case that would allow Turkey's accession 
process to proceed.  She indicated the EU's focus on the 
Lisbon Treaty has overshadowed the Turkish court case, thus 
limiting discussion among EU members.
