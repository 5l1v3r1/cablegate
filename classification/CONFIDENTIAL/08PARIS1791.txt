RECOGNITION OF SOUTH OSSETIA AND ABKHAZIA 
 
REF: STATE 96677 
 
Classified By: PolMC Kathleen H. Allegrone for reasons 1.4 (B & D). 
 
¶1.  (C) The GOF shares USG opposition to Nicaragua's 
recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia according to French 
MFA desk officer Philippe Garcia de la Rosa who spoke to 
poloff on September 22.  Garcia said the GOF agrees with all 
points in reftel and further rejects efforts to liken the 
independence of Kosovo to Russian military action in S. 
Ossetia, Abkhazia and Georgia.  He said the EU had already 
delivered similar points in a demarche to Managua. 
 
¶2.  (C) Garcia said President Ortega's decision to recognize 
¶S. Ossetia and Abkhazia was "not surprising," as tensions 
between the West and Ortega, especially between Nicaragua and 
the EU, have been increasing.  Garcia said Ortega, like 
Chavez in Venezuela and Morales in Bolivia, is trying to mask 
internal problems -- especially regarding government efforts 
to limit participation of opposition parties in the political 
process -- by diverting attention to international issues. 
 
¶3.  (C) For example, Garcia said the EU has recently been 
troubled by Nicaraguan vice foreign minister Coronel Keautz's 
threat on August 14 to declare Swedish ambassador Eva 
Zetterberg persona non-grata (PNG).  While we defer to 
Embassies Stockholm and Managua on the political analysis of 
these issues, local Swedish embassy contacts in Paris told 
poloff on September 24 that Zetterberg departed post on 
August 21 as part of a global downsizing of Swedish missions, 
and not as a result of being PNGed.  Although Zetterberg was 
publicly critical of GON efforts to limit participation of 
opposition parties in the upcoming November municipal 
elections, the Swedes indicated that the harsh public 
statement by Keautz was most likely the GON's way of 
expressing its displeasure with the closing of the Swedish 
embassy there. 
 
¶4.  (C) Garcia said the GOF and EU will continue to work to 
improve relations between the EU and GON, but noted that 
France would not be taking a leading role in this effort. 
Rather, France will remain "prudent" and "reserved" on 
bilateral relations with Nicaragua. 
 
¶5.  (C) COMMENT: Garcia reflects a European preference to 
coordinate foreign policy within the European Union 
particularly on issues of relatively marginal importance in 
Paris.  As if to exemplify the limited importance of 
Nicaragua in French foreign policy priorities, Garcia noted 
that Nicaragua has not had an ambassador in Paris for the 
past two years, the reasons for which he said were not clear. 
 If this meeting is broadly reflective of overall French 
policy on Nicaragua, then France seems content to lend 
support to EU initiatives from behind the scenes.  END 
COMMENT.
