(C) In the absence of Foreign Minister Manuel Rodriguez, who 
is currently in Europe, Ambassador on 7/26 delivered reftel 
demarche opposing the G-4 framework resolution to MFA Vice 
Minister Oscar Maurtua.  Maurtua said the GOP still had not 
reached a final decision on whether to vote in favor or to 
abstain if this issue comes to a vote.  Maurtua said that the 
decision will be made by President Toledo, and he promised to 
convey the USG's views to the President in the course of the 
day.  The Ambassador has attempted to contact President 
Toledo directly, and is awaiting a return call.  The 
Ambassador also spoke with the Italian Embassy to compare 
notes, given that FM Rodriguez is passing through Italy.
