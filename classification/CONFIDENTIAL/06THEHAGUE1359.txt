SUBJECT: NETHERLANDS/VENEZUELA/BRAZIL: FM TO TRAVEL JULY 
10-11; NO MEETING WITH CHAVEZ 
 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Andrew Schofer; reasons 1.4 (b) and 
(d). 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Dutch FM Bot will likely travel to Brazil and 
Venezuela July 10 and 11, to meet with the Foreign Ministers 
of those two countries.  As late as last month, the Dutch had 
hoped the meetings would be with Presidents Lula da Silva and 
Chavez.  Chavez has refused for over a year to meet with Bot, 
and the Dutch have decided not to pursue the matter further. 
The MFA would welcome our thoughts prior to the visit.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Venezuela desk officer Dimitri Vogelaar informed 
poloff June 16 that Bot's trip to Caracas is set for July 11 
and is "pretty firm."  Bot will travel first to Brazil and 
will stay overnight, if logistically possible, only in 
Curacao.  Bot will meet with his Venezuelan and Brazilian 
counterparts and not with heads of state. 
 
¶3. (C) Just last month, the MFA told us they expected Bot to 
meet with both Chavez and Lula da Silva.  Vogelaar, without 
admitting defeat, has said that the MFA decided that FM-level 
meetings were more "appropriate."  He said talks with Brazil 
would focus heavily on trade, while those with Venezuela 
would focus on Netherlands Antilles status negotiations, oil 
and energy, and human rights. 
 
¶4. (C) Vogelaar said the MFA would appreciate any information 
we wished to share with them prior to the visit.
