SUBJECT: STILL NO AGREEMENT ON DRAFT DECLARATION FOR
UNASUR-AFRICAN UNION SUMMIT

REF: CARACAS 1059

Classified By: Political Counselor Robin D. Meyer,
for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).

¶1. (C) Summary: South African Ambassador Bhekizzizwe Gila
told Ambassador Duddy on September 18 that South African
President Zuma would attend the September 26-27 UNASUR
-African Union Summit taking place on Venezuela's Margarita
Island. Gila said the heads of state of Brazil, Libya,
Algeria, and possibly Ecuador would also attend. He noted
that the Venezuelan government (GBRV) has resisted making any
changes in their proposal for a Summit Declaration, which
includes several articles praising the "Bolivarian Socialist
Revolution." Brazil and South Africa are negotiating
separately to develop an alternative declaration. End
Summary.

President Zuma Coming to Venezuela
----------------------------------

¶2. (C) In spite of earlier reports of minimal South African
participation at the UNASUR - African Union Summit (reftel),
Gila confirmed that President Zuma would attend the event.
He noted that South Africa is hoping to increase its business
relationship with Venezuela, especially with regards to the
mining industry. He said that South Africa currently has
only a very light presence in Venezuela, especially compared
to Colombia, where South African investment is significant.
The South African government is actively encouraging the GBRV
to rejoin the Kimberley Process regulating the diamond trade.
"The Venezuelans," Gila said, "are flooding the illegal
market with diamonds, and affecting international prices."
In addition to attending the Summit, President Zuma hopes to
hold bilateral meetings with senior GBRV officials.

Venezuelans Unwilling to Negotiate the Summit Declaration
--------------------------------------------- ------------

¶3. (C) Preparatory meetings for Summit have apparently
failed to result in a negotiated Summit Declaration. Gila
said the Venezuelans do not seem to have the "necessary
patience" required for multilateral negotiations, and the
GBRV's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has refused to discuss any
changes to the text. The GBRV proposal has over 80 articles,
Gila said, beginning with several that praise the Bolivarian
Socialist Revolution. Gila called the GBRV's projects like
BancoSur and TeleSur symbolically acceptable, but
"impractical." He also questioned the Venezuelans' insistence
on locating all south-south institutions in Caracas. South
Africa to date has refused to accept the declaration as
drafted and is negotiating with Brazil on a separate two-page
compromise document. Gila indicated that Venezuelan
intransigence could result in no Summit declaration at all.
