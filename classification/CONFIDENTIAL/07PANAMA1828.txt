SUBJECT: PANAMA: "WHAT'S NEXT?" IN VENEZUELA 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William A. Eaton.  Reasons:  1.4 (b) and (d)

What's Next for Chavez?

¶1. (C) "What's next in Venezuela," First VP and FM Samuel 
Lewis asked Ambassador on December 3.  Stunned by the "No" 
victory in Venezuela, Lewis commented, "Everybody is holding 
their breath to see what Chavez does next."  Lewis mused that 
Chavez would need to change the subject and grab a new issue 
to rebound from his loss at the ballot box.  That issue could 
be returning to his efforts to free kidnapped victims from 
the FARC.  "The issue played favorably for Chavez; he got 
proof of life for Ingrid de Betancourt and others," Lewis 
added. 
 
------------------------------- 
What's Next for the Opposition? 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) Noting that the opposition would have difficulty 
sustaining its momentum -- "There's no electoral event on the 
horizon" -- Lewis wondered if the oppositin could or would 
try to return to the recall referendum to end Chavez's term 
before 2012.  MFA Senior Advisor Nils Castro, who accompanied 
Lewis, noted the important role of students in the "No" 
campaign and said that he believed a new generation of 
leaders was emerging.  (Note:  Castro is sent frequently by 
Lewis and President Torrijos to Caracas as a private emissary 
to Chavez and high-ranking GOV leaders.) Lewis noted how 
quickly older opposition leaders like Antonio Ledezma and 
Manuel Rosales, who Lewis asserted had been largely absent 
from the "No" campaign, were to get on the airwaves on the 
night of the referendum.
