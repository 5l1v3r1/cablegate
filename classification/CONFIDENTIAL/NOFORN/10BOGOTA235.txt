SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Government of Colombia (GOC) continued its leadership 
in the Haiti relief effort at a February 9 UNASUR (Union of South 
American Countries) meeting in Quito, Ecuador.  At the summit, 
President Uribe expressed his support for the summit's 
reconstruction initiatives, including reducing Haiti's outstanding 
debt to international lenders.  President Uribe also spoke briefly 
with Ecuadoran President Correa, and the two leaders announced 
plans for a second such meeting in two weeks at the Rio Group 
Summit in Cancun.  MFA officials told us they see this as evidence 
of a continuing thaw in bilateral relations.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
GOC PRIVATELY PESSIMISTIC 
 
ON UNASUR'S ABILITIES ... 
 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) President Uribe attended the Extraordinary Summit of UNASUR 
countries on February 9 in Quito, Ecuador.  Per ref A, the UNASUR 
countries approved a $100 million UNASUR fund for Haiti as well as 
a request for a $200 million loan from the Inter-American 
Development Bank to be paid back by UNASUR countries.  In a 
post-summit press statement lauding UNASUR's declarations, Uribe 
added the GOC would also participate in multilateral efforts to 
reduce Haiti's external debt and would use expertise garnered from 
a 1999 Colombian quake to help rebuild a mid-sized Haitian city 
(septel). 
 
 
 
¶3. (C/NF) Paola Lugari, Coordinator for Regional and Multilateral 
Affairs at Colombia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), told us on 
February 11 that the GOC was skeptical about UNASUR's ability to 
effectively follow through on its pledges.  She pointed out that 
the body's lack of internal institutions would make it extremely 
difficult for UNASUR to collect and distribute such vast amounts of 
aid.  She said two other possible distribution mechanisms -- giving 
the money to Ecuador (as current UNASUR president) to distribute or 
giving the money directly to the Haitian government -- were neither 
realistic nor acceptable to the GOC.  She noted that this 
skepticism was behind the GOC's decision to keep pressing forward 
with direct bilateral aid and assistance to Haiti. 
 
 
 
... BUT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT 
 
RAPPROCHEMENT WITH ECUADOR 
 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Colombian media hailed Uribe's visit to Ecuador as a sign of 
improving bilateral relations.  (NOTE: This was Uribe's first visit 
to Ecuador since the two countries began to re-establish diplomatic 
relations in November 2009.  Ecuador broke ties after a March 2008 
military strike against FARC Commander Raul Reyes's camp just 
across the border in Ecuador.  End Note).  Uribe and Correa spoke 
privately for about 10 minutes -- mostly diplomatic niceties and 
small talk, Lugari told us -- and agreed to hold another such 
discussion at the Rio Treaty Summit to be held on February 22-23 in 
Cancun, Mexico.  Uribe later stated in a press interview that he 
hoped to quickly restore full diplomatic relations with Ecuador. 
 
¶5. (C/NF) Lugari told us that MFA officials were optimistic that 
the discussion signified a greater Ecuadorean willingness to 
improve relations.  She opined that Venezuelan President Chavez's 
domestic problems were reducing his interest in regional affairs, 
which allowed Chavez allies like Correa a bit more latitude.  She 
added that many in the GOC believe that Correa is finding his 
former strongly anti-Colombia stance less politically useful and 
that certain realities -- in particular Ecuador's dependence on 
Colombia for energy -- were bringing him around to a more practical 
policy.  She concluded that the two leaders' meeting in Cancun 
would likely set the tone for the bilateral relationship and hoped 
that the GOE would act reasonably and show a willingness to 
compromise.
