Interested in Co-Sponsoring

¶1.  (SBU) "Panama would probably like to co-sponsor the 
proposed U.S. resolution" condemning the use of rape as an 
instrument of state policy, MFA DG for International 
Political Affairs Javier Bonagas told POLCOUNS on October 2. 
Bonagas said that he would ask Panama's Mission to the UN to 
engage with USUN with an eye to co-sponsoring and "reaching 
consensus as quickly as possible on the resolution's text." 
Panama would not "of course" be able to fully commit to 
support or co-sponsorship until it had seen the proposed 
text, Bonagas added.

Comment

¶2.  (C)  These days Panama is particularly interested in 
underscoring that it remains a close friend and "strategic 
ally" of the U.S.  On September 1, the Panamanian National 
Assembly elected governing Revolutionary Democratic Party 
(PRD) Deputy Pedro Miguel Gonzalez -- indicted on five counts 
in connection with the 1992 murder of U.S. serviceman Zak 
Hernandez -- as the chamber's president.  Gonzalez's election 
comes at an awkward time for Panama as the recently signed 
U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) awaits action by 
the Hill.  Panama can be expected to be eager to find ways to 
be helpful to the U.S. in and effort to mitigate the impact 
on U.S.-Panamanian relations of Gonzalez's election.  The 
U.S. has an opportunity to harness Panama's increased desire 
to be our friend to consolidate support for this resolution.
