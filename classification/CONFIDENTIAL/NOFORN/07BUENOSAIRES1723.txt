SUBJECT: ARGENTINE TIP LEGISLATION STALLED IN CONGRESS 

UNTIL AFTER OCTOBER ELECTIONS 

 

REF: BUENOS AIRES 1685 

 

Classified By: AMBASSADOR EARL ANTHONY WAYNE, 

FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 

 

¶1. (SBU)  On August 27, Ambassador asked Argentine Minister 

of the Interior (MOI) Anibal Fernandez about the prospects 

for enacting comprehensive federal Trafficking in Persons 

(TIP) legislation in Argentina.  Fernandez stated that it is 

""very difficult"" to make progress in the Argentine Congress 

on this legislation at this time, and that he personally 

beleives this is ""a pity.""  When the Ambassador asked if he 

could help move things ahead, Fernandez replied that for now 

the situation is frozen, but after the October 28 elections 

things could move again. 

 

¶2.  (C)  Fernandez said that the provincial authorities are 

resisiting making federal offenses out of matters that are 

now handled at the local level.  This is particularly true of 

the provinces in northeast Argentina, where trafficking is 

particularly widespread.  He candidly acknowledged that 

resistance in the northeast is in part because local judges 

and politicians there are more likely to be corrupt - and 

sometimes even connected to trafficking rings themselves - 

and have a vested interest in keeping federal authorities off 

their turf. 

 

¶3.  (SBU)  Fernandez believes the meetings between Argentine 

and U.S. officials in Washington earlier this year on TIP 

worked against the passage of federal legislation in 

Argentina.  Prior to the Washington meetings, Fernandez was 

optimistic that the the various interested factions in 

Argentina had reached a tentative agreement on new 

legislation.  Criticism of Argentina's TIP situation by one 

USG official during and after a Washington meeting on the 

issue, he claimed, contributed to the agreement unraveling. 

 

¶4.  (SBU)  The Ambassador also raised the situation of 

Argentine anti-TIP activist Susana Trimarco, who has recently 

faced threats and harassment from traffickers.  Fernandez 

replied that he was aware of the situation, and assured the 

Ambassador that he was taking steps to ensure the safety of 

Trimarco and her colleagues.  Fernandez said that he has 

known Ms. Trimarco for many years and he remains in close 

contact with her.  He observed that she was ""one tough lady"" 

who would not be easily intimidated. 

 

¶5.   (SBU)   The Ambassador referred to past discussions 

concerning the creation of a Trafficking Prevention and 

Assistance program in Argentina.  Ambasador noted that he was 

pleased to see the creation of the program announced in the 

July 27 ""Official Bulletin,"" but was surprised to see the 

jurisdiction of the program fell under the Ministry of 

Justice.  All past discussions concerning the program had 

placed jurisdiction for the program under the MOI.  Fernandez 

said he could understand why the Ambassdor was confused.  He 

explained that placement of the program under the 

jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice was a part of the 

compromise agreement that had been reached earlier in the 

year and fundamentally reflected the fact that people in 

Congress did not fully understand the law.  He concluded, 

""What are you going to do?"" evidencing clear frustration with 

the legislative process on this subject.
