Summary 
------- 
¶1. (U) On July 24, the Queen's Representative dissolved the 
Cook Islands Parliament and called for a snap election.  The 
move came ahead of a vote of no confidence in the Cabinet.  A 
new election must be held within ninety days.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Queen's Representative, HE Sir Frederick 
Goodwin, dissolved the Cook Islands Parliament at 9:00 a.m. 
local time, July 24.  Under the Constitution, the QR has the 
discretion to dissolve Parliament if requested by the Prime 
Minister.  According to New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade (MFAT), PM Jim Marurai met with QR Goodwin 
late on the evening of Friday, July 21 to discuss options 
ahead of a vote on a motion of no confidence in the Cabinet, 
scheduled to take place on the 24th. 
 
¶3. (U) The events leading to the dissolution of Parliament 
began with intense political maneuvering surrounding 
by-elections in the Teenui-Mapumai and Matavera electorates 
-- which went to Speaker Norman George (Independent) and 
Kiriau Turepu (Cooks Islands Party, or CIP) respectively. 
Prior to the Matavera by-election on July 18, Teina Bishop 
(CIP) Minister of Outer Islands (who was in Cabinet despite 
being from the Opposition), resigned in support of the CIP. 
With Turepu's victory in Matavera, there was an apparent 
12-12 split between Democratic Party coalition government and 
the Opposition. Speaker George indicated he would break 
convention and support the Opposition in a non-confidence 
motion on the Cabinet, giving the upper hand to the CIP. 
 
¶4. (C) MFAT anticipated that the motion of no-confidence 
would carry, and that the CIP would be able to form a 
government.  QR's decision to dissolve Parliament came as a 
surprise to the New Zealand High Commission in Rarotonga and 
MFAT officials in Wellington.  At this time, MFAT is not able 
to make predictions about election outcomes.  However, MFAT 
reports that the High Commission observes a general sense of 
relief in the public following QR Goodwin's decision to 
dissolve Parliament, which many feel brings a sense of 
stability and a welcome break from the mercurial political 
loyalties in the chamber. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Under the Constitution, a general election must be 
held within ninety days.  A provision of the Constitution 
allows for a 90-day period of government operations without a 
budget.  The snap election will need to occur early enough to 
ensure that an appropriation bill is passed before the end of 
90 days.  MFAT anticipates that an election will be held 
earlier, but no earlier than six weeks.
