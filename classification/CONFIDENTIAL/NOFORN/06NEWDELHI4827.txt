SUBJECT: GOI AGREES WITH UN REFORM INITIATIVE IN PRINCIPLE 
 
REF: A. USUN 1254 
 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 106562 
 
Classified By: Charge Geoffrey Pyatt for Reasons 1.5 (b) 

¶1.  (C) The DCM used a July 7 meeting with MEA Additional Secretary (International Organizations) K.C. Singh to warn 
SIPDIS (REF B) that India's obstinate role on UN reform was increasingly at odds with our emerging strategic partnership. The DCM presented ref A demarche and urged the Indians to reconsider their position on this issue.  Singh replied that India currently occupies a ""grey zone"" between the smaller reactionary NAM states and the larger powers, and that its traditional role in the G-77 makes it difficult for New Dehli to appear to be jumping to do the bidding of the U.S. while it is focused on its campaign for the Security Council. Singh maintained that while the GOI ""has no problems"" with many of the U.S.-backed reform provisions, the GOI is concerned about not diluting the prerogatives of the General Assembly.  Going point-by-point through the draft resolution, Singh offered immediate support for the provisions regarding accountability, transparency and management reform, while expressing reservations about the matter of budget implementation.  Singh indicated that he would instruct the GOI UN delegate to speak favorably on the provisions that were agreeable to India. 

¶2.  (C) Singh indicated that the GOI is most concerned about the language regarding UN budget implementation, pointing out that it has sought clarification of the phrase ""limited discretion in budgetary implementation for the Secretary General to redeploy posts.""  He affirmed that the GOI does not ""want reform to strengthen the Secretary General at the cost of the General Assembly,"" and suggested that a ""blank check"" for the Secretary General would usurp General Assembly privilege. Looking at paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 (REF A) he agreed to have his experts examine whether this would meet the GOI threshold for an acceptable level of budget flexibility. 

¶3.  (C) Singh portrayed the GOI as a moderating force in the UN.  Describing most UN member countries as ""either playing the numbers game, or being one of the big boys,"" he maintained that India is both, but neither at the same time. Singh added that minor UN members see a lack of transparency in the actions of the more powerful members, who are forcing their agendas upon the body as a whole with little explanation or justification.  Singh advised that the US should be more transparent in its intentions and not try to force its decisions through. In this context he welcomed further dialogue on these reform issues, now and in the fall General Assembly.
