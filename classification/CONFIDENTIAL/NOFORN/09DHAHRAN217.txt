CLASSIFIED BY: Kevin Kreutner, Acting Consul General, EXEC, DOS. 
 
REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 
SUMMARY: 
 
------- 
 
¶1. (C/NF) During the past year the provincial government in the 
Eastern Province (EP) has closed five Shia mosques (four Twelver 
Shia and one Ismaili Shia) in the commercial city of al-Khobar, 
with the last two being closed in the past two weeks.  The 
provincial government reportedly carried out the closures by 
arresting and threatening to arrest the mosque owners and/or 
imams if they continued to hold prayers and by posting police 
near the mosques.  Post contacts point to Prince Mohammed bin 
Fahd, governor of the EP, as the driving force behind the 
closures.  The authorities have reportedly told the mosque 
owners that the closures were due to improper zoning and lack of 
appropriate permits.  However, past and pending requests to 
build Shia mosques in al-Khobar have reportedly not been 
granted.  On July 26 a delegation of Shia leaders from al-Khobar 
met with King Abdullah to raise this issue.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SHIA MOSQUES OF AL-KHOBAR: 
 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C/NF) In an August 10 meeting, XXXXXXXXXXXX (strictly 
protect), the XXXXXXXXXXXX, explained to PolOff that the Shia mosques in al-Khobar are known as "Waqf."  As opposed 
to a typical mosque with a towering minaret and loudspeakers announcing the call to prayer, these Waqfs involve an individual opening his home (or a part of his home) for public prayer services.  The Waqfs in al-Khobar are sanctioned by local Shia clerics as suitable alternatives to traditional mosques, which the Saudi authorities have not granted permits to build.  There are reportedly about 20,000 
Shia living in al-Khobar (out of total population of 
approximately 411,000), many of whom have attended prayer 
services at these mosques/Waqfs for more than a decade. 
 
¶3. (C/NF) Four of the mosques belong to the Twelver or Imami 
Shia, the most common sect living in the EP, XXXXXXXXXXXX reported, with the fifth mosque belonging to the Ismaili Shia, who 
originated from Najran.  The bustling commercial city of 
al-Khobar is not a traditional homestead of the Saudi Shia. 
Most of the Shia residents moved to al-Khobar from al-Ahsa, 
Qatif, and Najran to find jobs with Saudi Aramco and other oil 
and gas companies.  (NOTE:  During the meeting with XXXXXXXXXXXX only four mosques had been closed,
but he was in the process of confirming a possible fifth closure.  The next day he confirmed and published XXXXXXXXXXXX.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
PRINCE MOHAMMED GIVES THE GREEN LIGHT: 
 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C/NF) Several contacts claim that Prince Mohammed bin Fahd 
(MbF), the wealthy and influential son of the late King Fahd, is 
behind the mosque closings, noting that the orders came from the 
provincial governor's office.  XXXXXXXXXXXX (strictly 
protect), a human rights activist and founder of XXXXXXXXXXXX, told PolOff in an August 9 meeting 
that MbF would have to personally approve the mosque closings 
before they could be carried out.  He told PolOff that he 
recommended to the Ismaili leadership that they work through the 
newly appointed governor of Najran and son of King Abdullah.  In 
his view, MbF will not lift the ban on Shia mosques in al-Khobar 
unless his hand is forced by the King.  XXXXXXXXXXXX (strictly protect), a Sunni tribal leader, told 
PolOff in an August 10 meeting that he sent a letter to the 
governor expressing concern about the al-Khobar mosque closings 
and the arrest of a Shia community leader.  He said that MbF 
responded by saying that XXXXXXXXXXXX should not interfere in this matter. 
 

SHIA AND MODERATE SUNNIS SPEAK OUT: 
 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX confirmed reports that Abdullah Saleh 
al-Muhanna was imprisoned in June 2009 for holding prayers in 
his home.  He told PolOff that he spoke with al-Muhanna while he 
was in prison.  Corroborating online reports, XXXXXXXXXXXX said 
that the Saudi authorities demanded that al-Muhanna sign a 
document promising not to hold prayer services in his home in 
the future.  After initially refusing, XXXXXXXXXXXX said that 
al-Muhanna eventually signed a slightly different statement to 
the same effect and was subsequently released.  (NOTE: 
XXXXXXXXXXXX is a self-proclaimed Sunni liberal and human rights 
activist.  XXXXXXXXXXXX END NOTE.) 
 
¶6. (C/NF) In mid-July, Sayyid Mohammad al-Nasser, a leading Shia 
cleric in al-Khobar, spoke out against the mosque closings and 
threatened to lead Friday prayers in the streets if necessary. 
Shia frustrations culminated with a small delegation of 
religious leaders from al-Khobar meeting with the King on July 
26 in Taif.  Several contacts confirmed that the delegation 
raised the al-Khobar mosque closings with the King, but a formal 
response has not been received yet.  However, XXXXXXXXXXXX, who is in direct contact with the delegation, told PolOff that the King's 
court informed them that they will have a response on the issue 
by the end of this week (August 14) and that it will be "good 
news."  They had not yet received the phone call from the King's 
court at the time of writing this telegram. 
 
COMMENT: 
 
------- 
 
¶7. (C/NF) Discriminatory measures such as the mosque closings in 
al-Khobar continue to be the modus operandi of elements of the 
SAG in their interactions with the Shia minority sect.  This 
year has seen sectarian tensions rise to the point of clashes in 
Medina in February (ref A) and rare public protests in the EP in 
March (ref B, C).  Although the Sunni-Shia tension that pervaded 
the Kingdom earlier this year has since dissipated, this latest 
act of discrimination has once again stirred the sectarian pot. 
King Abdullah's clear public stance on the need for dialogue and 
mutual respect between Sunnis and Shias may well result in 
moderating or reversing the mosque closing decision.  While a 
welcome move if it happens, it will also underscore the 
significant and continuing internal differences on this issue 
that can only be resolved at the highest level.  END COMMENT.
