Classified By: Classified by DCM Sylvia Reed Curran. Reasons 1.4 (b) an 
d (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Iran Watcher recently met with a Turkmenistan-trained 
physician who has lived and worked in Iran for most of the 
last ten years.  XXXXXXXXXXXX, originally from Ashgabat, has 
practiced medicine in Tehran since settling there with her 
husband, the son of a retired XXXXXXXXXXXX. They recently 
transferred to the XXXXXXXXXXXX city of XXXXXXXXXXXX, where XXXXXXXXXXXX is employed at a hospital that is partially financed by the government and her husband has his own XXXXXXXXXXXX. The 
couple have a ten-year old son and XXXXXXXXXXXX. 
 
¶2. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX, currently in her early thirties, met her 
husband in medical school XXXXXXXXXXXX.  Before moving to Iran, she studied Farsi at the Iranian Cultural Center to be able to 
pass medical equivalency exams in Iran.  She said that 
western-trained physicians, especially with U.S. degrees, are 
in extremely high demand there and charge a premium for 
consultations.  She enjoys living in Iran, especially the 
vibrancy and fast pace of Tehran and finds Iranians extremely 
kind, hospitable and sociable.  Nevertheless, she and her 
husband, also at the urging of his parents, have high hopes 
of emigrating to the U.S.  Without exception, she said, every 
professional she knows in Iran, particularly doctors, would 
leave Iran "in a heartbeat" if given an opportunity to move 
to the United States, for "freedom and an opportunity to 
advance professionally." 
 
GRAMMAR SCHOOL INDOCTRINATION 
 
¶3. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX mentioned that her son attended the first grade when they were in Turkmenistan, but has gone to school since 
then in Iran.  She was shocked, she said, when she saw the 
level of indoctrination of young children that goes on in 
Iranian schools, at the expense of teaching essential 
academic subjects.  The authorities "use Islam as an 
ideology" (i.e. much more than just religion) to "brainwash" 
children in the schools, a practice that reminded her of her 
own early schooling in the former USSR, where the ideology of 
Lenin was venerated above everything else. 
 
IRANIANS LOVE THE OBAMAS 
 
¶4. (C) Iranians, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX, maintain a very 
positive view of both the United States and U.S. foreign 
policy, not withstanding the Iranian government's constant 
criticism.  The only issue about which many still feel 
resentment towards the United States, she said, is for its 
support of Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war.  For this 
reason, Iranians hold the United States responsible for the 
deaths of "so many young men and boys."  Like most Iranians 
she knows, her preferred source for international news is CNN 
and BBC.  She noted that Iranians are very taken with 
President Obama, whom they find "good-looking, charming and 
smart,"  They also think that Mrs. Obama is "beautiful and 
stylish."  In the last two weeks, she said, Iranian women 
have been flocking to one Tehran boutique and paying between 
3000 and 4000 USD apiece for replicas of Mrs. Obama,s white 
inaugural ball gown. 
 
RESIGNED TO ANOTHER AHMADINEJAD TERM 
 
¶5. (C) Asked about people's views about the upcoming 
presidential elections in Iran, XXXXXXXXXXXX said that most 
Iranians she knows see the re-election of Ahmadinejad as a 
"foregone conclusion."  She added that it makes little 
difference who is elected president because, "in Iran, the 
Supreme Leader decides everything."  In general, she said, 
the Iranians she knows are fearful of the government and 
avoid involvement in political matters.  Instead, they focus 
on everyday concerns: family finances, the education of their 
children, and health care.  Even within her husband's family, 
she said, there was little discussion of politics or her 
father-in-law's work XXXXXXXXXXXX; everyone 
understood that the subject was off-limits. 
 
¶6. (C) COMMENT: Our interlocutor, a Turkmen woman "happily" 
settled in Iran, is by her own admission not particularly 
engaged politically and more focused on her career and 
raising a family, a reaction to the dismal state of internal 
politics.  Despite enjoying a comfortable lifestyle, she and 
her husband hope to emigrate to the United States to enjoy 
the freedom and professional development, a trait that 
appears to be broadly shared among their contemporaries. END 
COMMENT.
