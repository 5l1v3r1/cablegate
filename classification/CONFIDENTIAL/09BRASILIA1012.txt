SUBJECT: MISSILE TECHNOLOGY CONTROL REGIME (MTCR): 
PROMOTING PARTICIPATION IN RIO PLENARY INFORMATION EXCHANGE 
(C) 
 
REF: SECSTATE 80072 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Stephen Liston.  Reason: 1.4(d) 
 
¶1.  (C)  Post delivered the reftel points to Ministry of 
External Relations (MRE) Director for Disarmament and 
Sensitive Technologies Santiago Mourao.  Mourao responded 
that Brazil was considering making a presentation at the 
plenary IE but had not yet decided on what subject. 
 
¶2.  (C)  As the host of the plenary, Brazil would like to 
make sure that any exchanges are productive and will propose 
consultations with key MTCR members on plenary issues. 
Notionally, the Brazilian representative, Ambassador 
Lamaziere, would like to visit the U.S., possibly during the 
last week of September.  He would like to conduct 
consultations on three levels: first, as Plenary Chairman, on 
broader issues facing the MTCR, particularly participation of 
additional states. (NOTE: Brazil believes it has an 
obligation to help its neighbor Chile participate.)  Second, 
Lamaziere, as the Brazilian rep, will consult on the 
political issues facing the MTCR.  Finally, Mourao will lead 
consultations on technical issues, such as export controls, 
proliferator activities and information exchanges. 
Commenting on Brazil's priorities, Mourao expressed the view 
that progress on the technical questions was impeded by the 
need to resolve structural issues, i.e. MTCR membership.  He 
said that Brazil would use its Presidency to try to make some 
progress on these "pressing" structural matters.
