CLASSIFIED BY: Darnall Steuart, Economic Counselor, DOS, Econ; 
REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1. (SBU) The evening of February 2, President Chavez announced the 
arrival of Cuban Minister of Technology and President of the 
Cabinet of Ministers Ramiro Valdez in Venezuela [NOTE: According to 
USINT Havana, Valdez is the Cuban Minister of Communication.  END 
NOTE].  He reportedly was sent to lead a technical commission to 
resolve Venezuela's electricity crisis (see reftels).  The 
government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (GBRV) 
previously has announced its intention to transition to a 
distributed electricity system modeled on Cuba's, i.e., a network 
of small generators distributed around the country.  Venezuela 
plans to double its distributed generation capacity from 1,000 MW 
to 2,000 MW (NOTE: Venezuela's peak electricity demand to date in 
September 2009 surpassed 17,000 MW).  This might alleviate some 
problems experienced in the rural areas of Venezuela, but would not 
impact large population centers, such as Caracas or Maracaibo. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Venezuelan blogs are speculating that Valdez actually has 
a different mission in Venezuela, i.e., to use his technical 
expertise to assist the GBRV clamp down on dissident voices finding 
expression through the Internet and new media, such as Twitter. 
[NOTE: Daily statistics on Venezuela's electricity sector, 
including the daily decrease in the water levels in the Guri dam 
reservoir, are publicly available on the internet from the 
Venezuelan Interconnected Systems Operations Office (SEN by its 
Spanish acronym).  END NOTE] 
 
 
 
¶3. (C) The press also reported that the Government of Brazil 
announced that it would send a senior level technical assessment 
team to Venezuela this week to help develop a solution to 
Venezuela's impending electricity crisis.  In contrast, EconOffs 
recently learned from a local businessman that a U.S. citizen 
engineer present in Venezuela to help repair the Guri hydroelectric 
turbines had shown his daughter a non-disclosure agreement that he 
had had to sign to keep his nationality and purpose in Venezuela a 
secret. 
 
 
 
¶4. (C) COMMENT: A GBRV move to enlist Cuban assistance to affect a 
short-term solution to the impending electricity crisis in 
Venezuela is logical, especially given Electricity Minister and 
former Venezuelan Ambassador to Cuba Ali Rodriguez' continuing 
close relations with Havana.  In reality, given the enormity of the 
electricity crisis, Venezuela likely needs all the help it can 
secure.  Short of rainfall or massive electricity rationing, 
however, no local industry analyst believes Venezuela will avoid a 
collapse of Guri by early summer.  Thus, the possibility raised in 
the blogosphere that the Cubans might not only be here to lend 
their electrical expertise but also their expertise in protecting 
potentially embarrassing government information, i.e., factual data 
on the deterioration of the electrical sector, represents a concern 
that the GBRV may take new measures to dampen social discontent by 
restricting access to public information.  END COMMENT.
