SUBJECT: BAHRAINI CROWN PRINCE MEETS A/S FELTMAN AND A/S 
SHAPIRO, DECEMBER 12 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Adam Ereli for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

1.(C) Summary: Bahrain's Crown Prince commented on his meeting with Iranian FM Mottaki and bemoaned the uncertainty in Iran's decision-making process. He stressed the importance of reintegrating Iraq into the Arab camp, and the need to get the Saudis involved in the process. He was eager to restart the Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD), and agreed to a more strategic focus. End summary.

2.(C) NEA A/S Feltman and PM A/S Shapiro met with Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa on December 12 on the margins of the IISS Manama Dialogue. The CP said he had just finished a meeting with Iranian FM Mottaki, and had told him that Iran needs to be "more predictable and transparent" in its decision-making and with respect to its nuclear program. He commented that it appeared the P5 1 process had "hit a wall," and A/S Feltman replied that, while the current offer would remain on the table, it was time to move toward tougher sanctions. CP Salman expressed appreciation for continued USG consultation.

3.(C) The CP agreed that we need a regional strategy for Iraq. He explained that countering Iran meant reintegrating Iraq into the Arab world. Salman lamented the fact that the Saudis had "personalized" matters and welcomed ideas for getting them involved, noting that Nuri Al Maliki is "the elected Prime Minister of Iraq and we must work with him." He instructed Bahrain's Foreign Minister, who was in attendance, to follow up with A/S Feltman on this issue.

4.(C) Salman eagerly accepted A/S Shapiro's offer to resume the GSD in early 2010. He noted the need to synchronize the GSD and MCC processes, and agreed with A/S Shapiro's suggestion for a smaller format for the GSD that would focus on broad strategic issues. Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa will chair for the Bahraini side.

5.(C) A/S Feltman informed the CP that the U.S. would soon transfer USD 75 million to the Palestinian Authority and urged him to take steps to ensure the transfer of Bahrain's USD 13.2 million Arab League commitment. Salman noted past GOB concerns with the transfer mechanism, but agreed to look into the matter.

6.(U) A/S Feltman and A/S Shapiro have cleared this message. ERELI
