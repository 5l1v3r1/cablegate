¶1. (C) Summary: Visiting Ankara in the run-up to Finland's EU 
term presidency, Finnish PM Vanhanen told PM Erdogan May 17 
that the EU is united on the need for Turkey to open its 
ports to Greek Cypriot shipping.  Vanhanen said Finland will 
continue its policy of supporting the accession of all EU 
candidates that meet membership criteria, and praised 
Turkey's role as an example of democracy in a troubled 
region.  Erdogan pledged to continue the GOT's EU-related 
reforms, but said Turkey cannot take any steps on Cyprus 
until progress is made in alleviating the isolation of the 
"TRNC."  He did not offer any new initiatives to address the 
problems of Turkey's predominantly Kurdish southeast.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Vanhanen held a one-on-one and a larger meeting with 
Erdogan and made courtesy calls on President Sezer and 
Parliamentary Speaker Arinc.  Other GOT leaders, including FM 
Gul and Economy Minister and EU negotiator Babacan, attended 
a dinner in Vanhanen's honor.  The Finnish DCM gave us a 
readout of the Vanhanen-Erdogan meetings. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Finland to Continue "Fair" Approach 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Erdogan told Vanhanen he is confident Finland will be 
supportive of Turkey as EU term president.  He recalled that 
Turkey became an EU candidate in 1999 under a Finnish 
presidency.  He averred that some EU states are putting 
obstacles in Turkey's path, and thanked Vanhanen for 
Finland's "more open minded" approach.  Erdogan assured 
Vanhanen that the GOT continues to place a high priority on 
EU accession, and rejected claims that Turkey has lost 
interest in the EU reform process.  He noted that the GOT in 
April announced a new package of reforms (reftel).  Vanhanen 
assured Erdogan that Finland will continue its fair, logical 
approach to EU enlargement -- any country given candidate 
status should be allowed to become a member once it meets the 
criteria. 
 
------------------- 
EU United on Cyprus 
------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Vanhanen told Erdogan the EU states are united on the 
need for Turkey to ratify and implement the Ankara Protocol, 
which requires Turkey to open its ports to Greek Cypriot 
shipping.  He said Turkey is obliged to do so as a Customs 
Union member, and this obligation cannot be linked to any 
other issues.  Vanhanen noted that the EU will release its 
annual progress report on Turkey in October or November.  The 
report will address the Protocol issue, and this could harm 
Turkey's candidacy if there are no new developments.  The 
report will also focus on human rights issues such as freedom 
of religion, freedom of expression, cultural rights, the 
draft anti-terror law, and civil-military relations. 
 
¶5. (C) Erdogan said Cyprus remains a "sensitive issue" for 
Turkey.  He reiterated standard Turkish complaints about the 
continued isolation of the "TRNC," despite the fact that 
Turkish Cypriots voted in favor of the Annan Plan.  The GOT, 
he said, took the political risk of backing the Annan Plan, 
but has nothing to show for it.  The EU took in the Greek 
Cypriots, but has not taken any meaningful steps regarding 
the "TRNC."  All parties involved need to work toward a 
comprehensive solution that is just and fair.  Erdogan 
stressed that Turkey cannot open its ports to Greek Cypriot 
shipping before progress is made in alleviating the isolation 
of the "TRNC."

No New Initiatives for Southeast

¶6. (C) Vanhanen asked Erdogan whether he had a plan for 
addressing the chronic problems of Turkey's predominantly 
Kurdish southeast.  Erdogan did not offer any new 
initiatives, instead outlining what he said were his 
government's accomplishments in the region.  Erdogan said the 
GOT under his leadership has undertaken extensive 
improvements in the education, transportation, and water 
infrastructure in the region.  He averred that the situation 
in the southeast is far better than outsiders have been led 
to believe by the propaganda of the terrorist Kurdistan 
Workers' Party (PKK).  Erdogan said the Kurds are one among 
36 ethnic groups in Turkey.  They are represented in 
goverment -- a number of MPs, for example, are Kurdish. 
Erdogan said "ethnic nationalism" is not tolerated, because 
all Turks have one nationality.  Nevertheless, he said, there 
is no official discrimination based on ethnicity. 
 
------------------------- 
Alliance of Civilizations 
------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) Erdogan touted Turkey's role in the Middle East as an 
example of democracy and rule of law.  He noted that Turkey 
and Spain are co-sponsors of the Alliance of Civilizations. 
Turkey lives in a troubled neighborhood where democracy and 
human rights are in short supply.  Turkey is in a position to 
help improve the situation, which is why the GOT supports the 
Broader Middle East and North Africa initiative.  Vanhanen 
said he appreciates Turkey's efforts to promote a dialogue 
between cultures, and noted that Finland has decided to join 
the Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations.
