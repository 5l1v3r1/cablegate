Panama Supports Ahtisaari's Recommendations 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (C) Supportive of UN Special Envoy for Kosovo Ahtisaari's 
recommendations, Panama was engaging Russia to avoid a 
Russian veto and secure adoption of a UN Security Council 
Resolution that supported Ahtisaari's recommendations, 
including his proposal for Kosovo's supervised independence, 
Panamanian First VP and FM Samuel told Ambassador on March 
¶26.  Anticipating that Ambassador was reaching out to him to 
deliver reftel demarche, Lewis noted that the key was 
avoiding a Russian veto, an achievable goal in Lewis' 
opinion.  Lewis said he had already spoken with Panamanian 
PermRep to the UN Arias and underscored the importance of 
working toward the adoption of an UNSCR supportive of 
Ahtisaari's recommendations.  Arias believed progress was 
being made with the Russians in New York, Lewis said, and, 
though Russia might not support this resolution, a Russian 
veto might be avoided.

¶2.  (C) Panama is not overly concerned about the substance of 
Kosovo's final status.  Understanding the importance that the 
U.S. and Europeans place on adoption of an UNSCR on Kosovo, 
Panama will focus on procedural matters -- primarily trying 
to avoid a Russian veto -- and ensuring a broaden enough 
consensus to which Panama can contribute its support.
