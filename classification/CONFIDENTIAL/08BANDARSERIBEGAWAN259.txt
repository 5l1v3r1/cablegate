SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR TODD OUTLINES AGENDA WITH SULTAN OF 
BRUNEI AND BRUNEI'S FOREIGN MINISTER 
 
BANDAR SER 00000259  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR TODD FOR REASONS 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1 (C) SUMMARY:  On September 15, 2008, Ambassador Todd 
presented his credentials to His Majesty, the Sultan of 
Brunei.  The Sultan and Ambassador Todd met afterwards in a 
meeting that moved the policy agenda beyond the normal 
niceties expected at a credentialing ceremony.  The 
Ambassador shared his thoughts on increased cooperation 
between Brunei and the United States, his lengthy experience 
in Washington, possible visits of the Sultan and Crown Prince 
to the US, and increasing educational exchanges.  The Sultan 
was especially interested in educational exchanges (including 
the military academies) and possible visits to the U.S. 
Ambassador Todd also met with Prince Mohamed, the Foreign 
Minister, prior to his ceremony with the Sultan.  Their 
discussion focused improving efficiency in the Brunei 
government and on Ambassador Todd,s desire to enhance 
economic cooperation.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MOVING BEYOND FORM 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (C)  While the pomp and circumstance of Ambassador Todd,s 
credentialing ceremony was impressive, his meeting with the 
Sultan was able to move the policy discussion beyond the 
traditional meet and greet.  While the Bruneians appreciated 
Ambassador Todd,s attention to detail during the 
credentialing ceremony, it was the focused nature of his 
conversation with the Sultan that received immediate kudos 
from GoB officials who were present.  Ambassador Todd weaved 
in a number of key issue points, while still allowing the 
Sultan to get a better sense of both his policy background 
and his years of Washington experience.  The Sultan concurred 
with Ambassador Todd that enhanced educational exchanges were 
important. He noted that he supports the Ministry of 
Education's efforts to increase scholarships and other 
opportunities for Brunei's students to study in the US. 
Ambassador Todd was able to provide a high level of personal 
detail in describing how Brunei's two students at West Point 
and the Air Force Academy are faring in their studies and 
adjustment to life at a service academy.  The Sultan seemed 
especially pleased (and amused) to learn that the Air Force 
cadet has lost a considerable amount of weight.  The Sultan 
was keen on the idea of future visits to the US.  These would 
incorporate visits to various US military bases, including 
Fort Bragg, SOUTHCOM, and PACCOM.  The Sultan was pleased to 
hear that Ambassador Todd has already spoken with military 
leaders in advance of a possible visit. 
 
 
NEED FOR FOCUS 
--------------- 

¶3. (C)   During the Ambassador's meeting with His Royal 
Highness, Prince Mohamed, it because clear that the Prince 
believed the Brunei government needs more focus and 
efficiency.  He talked at length with Ambassador Todd about 
the inefficient nature of many departments.  Ambassador Todd 
noted he was very impressed with the efforts of the Brunei 
Economic Development Board (BEDB).  BEDB is currently working 
to tender a number of contracts that normally fall under the 
various Ministries and they are bringing private sector 
methods into the process.  Ambassador Todd emphasized that he 
has a long service record in Washington and he looks forward 
to working with the Foreign Ministry directly.  Ambassador 
emphasized that he will do everything he can to assist US 
businesses in increasing economic ties with Brunei. Prince 
Mohamed also offered his appreciation for Special Envoy 
Cumber,s recent visit to Brunei. 
 
AMBASSADOR'S COMMENT 
-------------------- 

¶4. (C)  The meeting with His Majesty, the Sultan, allowed the 
Embassy to move beyond form and function.  The same can be 
said for the meeting with Prince Mohamed.  What was readily 
apparent was that the Sultan deeply values the U.S friendship 
and wants to build on it.  He also respects those who provide 
him with unbiased and timely information, as we were able to 
do in our meetings.  Following the ceremony, the French 
Ambassador noted that the only reason he and the other two 
Ambassadors who were at the credentialing ceremony were given 
more than a few moments was due to the U.S. influence on the 
process and our wish to have substantive talks.  Since then, 
we have received numerous compliments both from within the 
Palace, within the Ministries, and from others in the 
Diplomatic Corps, about how well our meetings went and the 
level of interaction we had with both His Majesty and Prince 
Mohamed.  We are already building on that rapport.
