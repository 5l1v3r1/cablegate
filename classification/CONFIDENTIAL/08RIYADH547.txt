SUBJECT: SAUDI ARAMCO TREASURER DISCUSSES ARAMCO'S 
INVESTMENTS 
 
Classified By: Consul General John Kincannon for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d 
). 
 
¶1. (C/NF) SUMMARY:  Saudi Aramco's Treasurer revealed to 
Consulate officials that Saudi Aramco manages liquid 
investments of approximately $60 billion, an amount he 
described as comparable to the fifth or sixth largest 
sovereign wealth fund in the Gulf.  Aramco is considering a 
number of corporate reorganization measures that would allow 
them to benefit from the strong capitalization of many of 
their ventures.  Although Saudi Aramco maintains strong 
relationships with many top American financial firms, their 
Treasurer says that a combination of factors causes Saudi 
Aramco to manage virtually all of its international 
investments from Europe.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------- 
A Man Who Writes Big Checks 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C/NF) The CG and Consulate officers met with Saudi Aramco 
Treasurer Motassim al-Maashouq (protect) at a social event on 
April 1.  Jokingly, the CG suggested to al-Maashouq that his 
most important job responsibility probably entailed sending a 
large check to Riyadh every month.  In the same spirit, 
al-Maashouq replied, "Actually, it's twice a month.  They're 
very happy.  They have no idea how to spend all this money." 
 
----------------------------- 
And Manages a Large Endowment 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C/NF)  Among al-Maashouq's responsibilities is managing 
the endowment for the new King Abdullah University of Science 
and Technology (KAUST).  "We're the third largest endowment 
in the world.  Harvard is $34 billion.  Yale is $21 billion. 
Stanford is $16 billion.  We're closer to Yale than 
Stanford."  Al-Maashouq revealed that Aramco had recently 
retained the services of Yale's long-time portfolio manager 
to advise the company on investing KAUST's endowment.  He 
noted that Aramco also maintains an active investment 
portfolio that has fully funded all of Aramco's future 
pension and medical liabilities.  "When you look at all of 
this, we're comparable to the fifth or sixth largest 
sovereign wealth fund in the Gulf.  We're certainly not in 
the league of Abu Dhabi or Kuwait, but we stack up very 
closely with the Qatar Investment Authority in terms of 
size."  Most publicly available information puts QIA's assets 
in the range of $60 billion. 
 
--------------------------- 
With a Strong Balance Sheet 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C/NF)  Al-Maashouq said that Saudi Aramco was examining a 
number of corporate reorganization strategies that might 
allow it to benefit from its strong and very conservative 
balance sheet.  "For example," said al-Maashouq, "you might 
not be aware that Saudi Aramco is one of the largest real 
estate developers in Saudi Arabia.  We buy large plots of 
land, develop housing, give loans to our employees to 
purchase it, but hold the title until the loan is fully paid 
off.  We also control the employee's paycheck.  You may have 
a sub-prime mortgage crisis in America, but this is as safe 
as could be.  We're looking at ways we could move the real 
estate arm out of the company, perhaps spin off our medical 
services with a strategic partner, and look at ways to 
leverage the Vela shipping fleet.  We look at GE Finance and 
GMAC Financing as potential models." 
 
-------------------------------------- 
But Aramco Manages Its Money in Europe 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C/NF)  Al-Maashouq opined that the United States "has 
really screwed up" by squandering American leadership in 
international capital and finance.  "You guys have restored 
London as the world's international financial center by 
shooting yourselves in the foot."  Citing a superior 
regulatory environment, many fewer visa hassles, and NOPEC 
legislation, al-Maashouq said that Aramco preferred to manage 
the bulk of its international investments through London or 
sometimes the Channel Islands.  Noting that Aramco maintains 
strong relationships with major American financial firms like 
JP Morgan Chase, KKR, Blackstone, and Warburg Pincus, 
al-Maashouq said that Aramco chose to work with their London 
offices rather than dealing with the visa problems and a less 
certain regulatory environment in the United States.
