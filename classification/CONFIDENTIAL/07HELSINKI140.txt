SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE - DEMARCHE:  U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT 
OSLO CLUSTER MUNITIONS MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 20863 
 
Classified By: POLCHIEF GREGORY THOME FOR REASONS 1.4 (A), (B), AND (D) 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolChief shared the substance of subject demarche 
Feb. 27 with Laura Kansikas-Debraise, Office Director of 
the Unit for Arms Control, Disarmament and Non- 
Proliferation.  Kansikas-Debraise expressed appreciation 
for the US position and re-emphasized 1) that Finland 
considers cluster munitions (CM) to be a viable part of its 
arsenal for national defense; 2) that the GOF agrees with 
the US that the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) 
meetings remain the appropriate fora for discussion of 
humanitarian and other issues related to CM; and 3) that 
Finland would not support any legally binding instruments 
prohibiting the use of CM. 
 
¶2. (C) COMMENT: Cluster munitions have become a sensitive 
topic in Finland in recent days, thanks to somewhat 
sensationalist press reports alleging that Finland intends 
to make a significant military acquisition of these 
weapons.  In response to international pressure, Finland is 
currently phasing out its once-extensive use of landmines 
to protect its long border with Russia.  As part of a 
program to bolster its land-based defensive capabilities in 
the face of the pending mine phase-out, the GOF has 
explored the idea of acquiring additional CM.  GOF 
discussions regarding the potential acquisition have not 
been held in secret and have been open to public scrutiny, 
Kansikas-Debraise explained, but for more than 18 months 
the issue never attracted any attention.  However, in 
recent weeks CM have become a focus of the Nordic press -- 
both as a result of the Feb. 22-23 Olso conference and 
because of the bad international press generated by 
Israel's use of CM in Lebanon in August.  The result in 
Finland has been accusations that the GOF is now 
substituting one internationally reviled weapon with 
another.  Nevertheless, the GOF will likely move forward to 
acquire additional CM.
