N 1.4 (B, D) 
 
¶1. (U) The GoNZ announced January 31 that it will station one 
military liaison officer in Baghdad to work in the UN 
Assistance Mission.  The soldier's work will include liaising 
with the MNF and the interim Iraqi Government's security 
forces, and the one-year deployment will be served in two 
six-month installments.  In making the announcement, Prime 
Minister Clark noted that the deployment was a "one-off," and 
that the GoNZ had not received any additional requests for 
troops from either the UN or the USG.  She also commended the 
strong turnout in the Iraqi elections, but expressed concern 
over low Sunni turnout, stating "it is going to be very 
important if Iraq if to go forward, that there is the maximum 
degree of inclusion." 
 
¶2. (U) Clark noted that the liaison officer will maintain 
NZ's profile as an active participant in UN peacekeeping 
operations - a profile which has flagged since participation 
in East Timor.  New Zealand's initial 12-month military 
deployment to Iraq ended September 25, 2004 (reftel) with the 
homecoming of over 60 engineers and support staff.  At that 
time Clark confirmed that no further deployments to Iraq were 
being considered, although even then she indicated a 
willingness to look favorably on a request from the UN for 
one or two military officers to serve in UN headquarters in 
Baghdad. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment:  Clark's decision to assign an officer to 
Iraq under UN auspices is in keeping in tone with earlier 
comments (reftel,) and allows Clark's Government to remain 
involved in a significant UN operation.  While it also 
enables NZ to continue to distance its presence in Iraq from 
the US and the Coalition, we predict that the Government will 
still try to take credit for the move when speaking with USG 
officials.  The assignment of one officer also reflects the 
GoNZ's efforts to balance a small, overstretched military 
force with a strong commitment to peacekeeping efforts 
worldwide.  Clark's lament that NZ's peacekeeping activities 
have declined since East Timor reaffirms the Government's 
view that NZ's peacekeeping capabilities are an effective 
vehicle for increasing NZ's public profile within the 
multilateral system.
