SUBJECT: MOFA DG UMEMOTO ON SECRET AGREEMENT INVESTIGATION 
 
Classified By: Charge d'Affaires James P. Zumwalt, reasons 1.4(b) and ( 
d). 
 
¶1. (C) On November 27, Charge d,Affaires discussed MOFA,s 
investigation of the so-called nuclear secret agreements and 
its possible effects on U.S. nuclear deterrent policy with 
MOFA North American Affairs Bureau Director General Umemoto. 
Charge stressed that an important element of U.S. deterrence 
strategy is to maintain ambiguity with regard to the presence 
or absence of nuclear arms on U.S. Navy vessels.  Adding that 
the Ambassador is concerned about the direction that this 
investigation could take, Charge emphasized that this 
discussion was not simply a Japanese domestic issue but one 
that could have implications for U.S. strategy in the broader 
global context, and touches on the interests of several 
neighboring Asian countries including Korea.  He added that 
the U.S. would be strongly opposed to providing any greater 
degree of clarity on the presence or absence of nuclear 
weapons on board our naval vessels. 
¶2. (C) Umemoto concurred this is a thorny issue, calling it 
perhaps ""more difficult than Futenma.""  Noting that he had 
not yet received instructions to approach the United States 
formally with regard to statements on tactical nuclear 
weapons on board U.S. vessels that called in Japanese ports, 
Umemoto told Charge he was ""concerned"" that the current 
political leadership did not understand the possible 
implications of the ""secret agreement"" investigation, which 
in Umemoto,s view, clearly had foreign policy ramifications. 
 He reacted positively to a suggestion by the Charge for more 
in-depth briefings for the Minister on U.S. extended 
deterrence policy and the broader context in which this issue 
must be addressed. 
 
¶3. (C) In the wake of the investigation,s findings, which 
will likely be published in January, Umemoto said a new 
formula must be found regarding port calls by U.S. vessels 
that maintains ambiguity in the U.S. nuclear posture.  One 
possibility would be to reiterate statements made by earlier 
administrations on the decision not to deploy tactical 
nuclear weapons on certain classes of vessels.  A second 
approach might be for the U.S. to make a general statement 
that, for the foreseeable future, the U.S. has no intention 
of deploying tactical nuclear weapons in Asia. Umemoto said 
it is important for the U.S. and Japan to continue to consult 
informally about how to respond to possible calls for more 
clarity in statements regarding nuclear weapons. 
¶4. (C) Umemoto expressed confidence that the ""wise man 
council"" established to review the internal MOFA document 
investigation will act in a measured way and reach reasonable 
conclusions.  He stated that most of the members, including 
Chairman Kitaoka, were well established, respected security 
experts.  However, the group has a very narrow mandate, and 
will limit its opinion to the contents and implications of 
the documents turned up during the investigation and 
declassification policy.  That mandate does not extend to 
policy recommendations, for example regarding the revision of 
Japan,s three non-nuclear principles. Umemoto also denied 
media reports that FM Okada had at one point considered 
suggesting revision of the three principles, adding that it 
was discussed only in theory, and was deemed politically 
impossible.
