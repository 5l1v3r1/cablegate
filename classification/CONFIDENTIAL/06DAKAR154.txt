SUMMMARY 
-------- 
¶1.  (C) The Vieira/Aristides Gomes Government continues to 
develop its program, and neither the Popular National 
Assembly (ANP) nor the Supreme Court seems anxious to bring 
the Government down.  The African Party for the Independence 
of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC) continues to argue 
for a national unity government and says that it will not 
cooperate, but the divisions within the largest party are out 
in the open.  Former President Malam Bacai Sanha believes 
that France is playing an unhelpful role.  For its part, the 
PRC donated USD 3 million to rehabilitate military barracks 
and facilities and to build a regional hospital in Canchungo. 
 Meanwhile, NDI has started work with parliamentarians and 
civil society, and Embassy Dakar,s new Guinea-Bissau 
Watcher, Gregory Holliday, has arrived.  After seven years, 
the Government has restored electricity to Bissau.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
ELECTRICITY RESTORED 
-------------------- 
¶2.  (U) Prime Minister Aristides Gomes, government continues 
to prepare its program and budget, as it shows 
Bissau-Guineans that it can make a difference in their lives. 
 Perhaps fearing that Liberian President Ellen 
Johnson-Sirleaf,s plans for Monrovia would leave Bissau as 
the only non-electrified African capital, the Gomes 
Government has restored electricity to Bissau after seven 
years of darkness. 
 
BUT WHERE,S THE POWER? 
---------------------- 
¶3.  (U) Meanwhile, the National Popular Assembly (ANP) and 
the Supreme Court each wait for the other to decide whether 
or not to bring the Government down.  Although the Supreme 
Court was to have ruled on the legitimacy of the Gomes 
Government by mid-December, it has yet to announce a 
decision.  For its part, the ANP seems to be in no hurry to 
schedule a budget/confidence vote, with the earliest such 
vote now likely in early February and no one is sure of the 
outcome. 
 
¶4.  (C) What is certain is the PAIGC,s undying hostility for 
President Joao Bernardo &Nino8 Vieira and Aristides Gomes. 
On January 10, the PAIGC released a statement making its 
opposition to the Government abundantly clear.  (COMMENT: 
Since defeated PAIGC presidential candidate Malam Bacai Sanha 
was in Spain when the PAIGC acted, it appears that former 
Prime Minister Carlos Domingos Gomes, Junior, continues to 
lead the hard liners, and the PAIGC,s divisions are out in 
the open.  END COMMENT.) 
 
¶5.  (C) In recent embassy meetings with Bacai, he had taken a 
somewhat softer line.  We urged reconciliation and a focus on 
the future, and he said he would be willing to meet with 
Vieira again.  However, he accused Vieira of corruption and 
narcotics trafficking (septel). 
 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
--------------- 
¶6.  (C) Bacai also had some interesting points to make on 
foreign policy.  Bacai asserted that Portugal has no strategy 
for Guinea-Bissau.  He also said that France is working 
through its &proxies, Guinea and Senegal8 to ensure that 
the development of Guinea-Bissau,s petroleum reserves is 
done by French companies.  Bacai stated that he would like to 
visit the United States in May, and Charge told him that we 
would be pleased to arrange some appointments for him in 
Washington. 
 
¶7.  (U) On January 17, Chinese Ambassador Tian Guangfeng and 
Secretary of State for International Cooperation Tibna Sambe 
 
SIPDIS 
Nawana signed a USD 3 million to rehabilitate military 
barracks and other military installations as well as to build 
a regional hospital in Canchungo.

DAKAR 00000154  002 OF 002 
 
 
------- 
¶8.  (C) Bacai may be correct that Portugal lacks a coherent 
strategy for Guinea-Bissau, but China seems to have one.  The 
Mission does not believe that either Guinea or Senegal is 
acting on France,s behalf in Guinea-Bissau.  While the 
political feuding in Bissau continues, the Gomes Government 
is taking action to build popular support.  At this point, it 
seems likely that the ANP will vote on the government,s 
budget and program )- essentially a confidence vote )- 
before the Supreme Court tackles the legitimacy issue. 
However, neither institution appears to want to be blamed for 
causing the Government to fall.  The National Democratic 
Institute has started its parliamentary training program, 
working from the Brazilian Embassy in Bissau, and our new 
Guinea-Bissau Watcher, Gregory Holliday, has assumed his new 
duties.  END COMMENT.
