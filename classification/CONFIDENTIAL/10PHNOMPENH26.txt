Classified By: DCM THEODORE ALLEGRA FOR REASONS 1.4 (B, D) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: During a three-hour meeting January 11 which 
was both active and at times exceedingly technical, the 
"Friends of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of 
Cambodia (ECCC)" discussed the budget request for 2010-2011 
as well as the preliminary budget estimates for 2012-2015. 
The Friends Group, which includes donors and the United 
Nations (UN) and Cambodian administrators, showed general 
support for the proposed budget, which includes salary 
increases for staff, but actively questioned several budget 
line items, demonstrating their desire to cut costs where 
possible.  Describing 2011 as the "peak pain threshold" for 
donor funding, the UN's Knut Rosandhaug indicated that 
funding requirements would begin to decrease by the end of 
2011 and broached the subject of transferring case 003 to the 
domestic court to further reduce the total amount required 
for the tribunal.  The role of a proposed Strategic Planner 
was debated, with Japan and Australia arguing that the 
position is not needed and duplicative, contrary to the U.S. 
and UK view.  The Friends, surprised to see a budget line 
item for the Independent Counselor, requested further 
information and also briefly discussed the status of the 
Special Advisor.  Finally, the Japanese Ambassador ended the 
meeting by expressing his government's concern with the 
extension of the judicial schedule (case 002 was originally 
projected to end in 2011) and requested a mechanism to inform 
donors regularly on schedule progress.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BUDGET PAIN THRESHOLD 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) Based on anticipated needs of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal 
(KRT) for the coming two years, the ECCC's budget request 
totaled $46 million for 2010 and $47.3 million for 2011 (the 
international side of the court accounts for approximately 
75% of the total amount each year).  The French Ambassador 
frankly asked both the national and UN administrators for 
specific dates of when they will have no more funds.  Tony 
Kranh, ECCC Director of Administration, stated that the 
national side will run out of money in February.  The EU has 
pledged 2 million Euro, pending both an international agency 
to implement the funds (UNOPS has unofficially expressed 
interest), and the amendment of financing agreements.  The EU 
representative estimated the funds may be available in May. 
Rosandhaug stated the international side has funds to see it 
through April, as well as a cash reserve which, after 
approval from the Steering Committee, could buy another few 
weeks.  The Japanese Ambassador suggested making an 
international appeal for donors, and to suspend non-urgent 
expenditures now. 
 
¶3. (C) In a methodical, line-by-line scrutiny, the donors 
gave general approval of the budget as a whole. 
Specifically, the donors supported salary increases for staff 
and judges.  Stating that it is "crucial to retain these 
judges (with experience)," Rosandhaug suggested the Steering 
Committee will approve the positive adjustment of salary for 
the judges if no objection is received by January 15. 
 
STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS CONFUSION 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (C) The group split, however, on the topic of the creation 
of new staff positions, specifically that of the Strategic 
Communications Officer (SCO).  The Japanese Ambassador stated 
he does not support the new position given that there is 
existing staff supporting this role.  The Australian 
Ambassador agreed, and said she "remains skeptical and 
doubtful" of the role this person would play.  Charge 
d'Affaires (CDA) and the UK Ambassador argued that the role 
is fundamentally different from that of Public Affairs, and 
that the need for a serious, professional, pro-active 
approach to the court and its legacy should not be ignored. 
While some donors understood the role of the SCO would be 
focused on the legacy of the court, others thought it was 
 
PHNOM PENH 00000026  002 OF 002 
 
 
intended to provide media policy going forward.  The Japanese 
Ambassador suggested that (proposed Special Advisor) Clint 
Williamson "give the strategic guidance" if it is deemed 
necessary.  When asked for an update on the Special Advisor 
position, Rosandhaug replied that the UN is simply "waiting 
on funding" before a Special Advisor could be appointed. 
 
SURPRISE OVER IC OPERATIONAL BUDGET 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (C) When the group reached the contractual services 
portion of the budget, all donors seemed surprised by the 
dollar amount ($145,600 for two years shared evenly between 
the RGC and the UN) affixed to the function of the 
Independent Counselor (IC).  Questioning when and how the 
amount was determined, the French Ambassador stated, "We all 
expected less."  The donors indicated that detailed reports 
will be required, and that they are also interested in the 
basic role and activities of the IC as that mechanism is 
implemented. 
 
JUDICIAL SCHEDULE 
----------------- 
 
¶6. (C) Although both administrators expect to keep to the 
current timeline, which was created in consultation with the 
judges, the dramatics of the final day of Duch's trial, in 
which he asked for acquittal, increased the likelihood of an 
appeal in Case 001.  The swiftness of Case 002 will depend in 
part on Pre-trial Chamber permanence (Reftel), but is 
expected to go to trial in early 2011.  Case 003 is scheduled 
to begin as soon as human resources are available from Case 
¶002.  Rosandhaug emphasized that the slow start of Case 003 
is not due to objections from the Cambodian government, but 
rather to the need to capitalize on the capacity and 
institutional knowledge of the current staff, who will first 
concentrate on Case 002 before phasing into Case 003. 
 
¶7. (C) Rosandhaug informed the donors that at the end of the 
final closing order for Case 003, the law stipulates that all 
residual matters of the court be transferred to the ECCC. 
However, according to Rosandhaug, in 2012 there will be a 
larger capacity on the national side to handle Case 003 and 
suggested that the law could be changed to transfer that case 
entirely to the domestic court (for this to happen, the 
Parliament would have to repeal the current law and 
promulgate a new law).  He emphasized that the question is 
about who will try the case, not the existence of it.  The 
CDA urged the UN and Cambodian government to initiate 
discussions on the topic to give it the modality and 
attention it deserves.  The Japanese Ambassador agreed, again 
suggesting it may become "the work of Ambassador Williamson." 
 
 
¶8. (C) Comment: This 15th meeting of the Friends of the ECCC 
was substantive, but also revealed gaps in either 
communication or understanding between the UN, the Cambodian 
government, and the donors.  There was confusion by all 
parties regarding whether the Strategic Communications 
position would be more media or legacy focused, and a general 
consensus that the job description needs to be clarified. 
Furthermore, the donors requested more transparency and 
information be shared regarding the IC.  The lack of 
information on the IC's budget served to highlight the 
overall dearth of information on the implementation of the 
IC's position.  The Japanese Ambassador underscored 
everyone's desire for better communication by requesting a 
mechanism whereby the court monthly updates donors on the 
schedule progress, including explanations and steps taken to 
address delays.  End Comment.
