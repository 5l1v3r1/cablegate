the MFA's Unit for African and Middle-East Affairs on Aug. 3. 
 The Finnish officials said that Finland's Ambassador to 
Syria was not currently in Damascus, and that the GoF has 
limited bilateral contact with the Syrian government. 
However, Finland intends to continue to work through the EU 
to encourage Syria to play a more helpful role in Iraqi 
stabilization.  The Finnish officials also asked if the U.S. 
had approached Syria about contributing financially to the 
proposed UN protection force.
