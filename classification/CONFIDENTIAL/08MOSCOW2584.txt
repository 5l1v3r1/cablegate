Classified By: Ambassador John R. Beyrle: Reasons 1.4 (b, d). 
 
¶1.  (C)  At the end of an August 27 meeting focused on 
Georgia (reftel), Deputy Foreign Minister Grigoriy Karasin 
told the Ambassador that Russia was very concerned about 
events in Pakistan.  In the wake of Musharraf's resignation, 
and with the departure of Nawaz Sharif from the coalition, 
"chaos reigned."  Russia was "worried" about the recent 
political developments, with Karasin stressing Russia's 
proximity to the South Asian nuclear power.  Karasin 
requested further information on U.S. views of Pakistan 
political developments, including the U.S. assessment of "how 
Russia should interpret the situation with respect to 
Pakistan's nuclear weapons." 
 
¶2.  (C)  Action Request:  We appreciate any additional 
guidance beyond Ref B that can be shared with Karasin's 
office.
