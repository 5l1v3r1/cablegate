Classified By: Ambassador Heather M. Hodges for Reasons 1.4 (b&d) 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: At a wide-ranging lunch for the Ambassador 
on January 26, a warm and friendly President Correa gave a 
firm green light for discussion and development of a 
gas-and-go model for anti-narcotics cooperation with the 
U.S., following the shutdown of the Manta Forward Operating 
Location.  Referring to the Andean Trade Preferences Act, 
Correa raised the importance to Ecuador of a stable and 
predictable trade relationship with the U.S.  Correa also 
expressed particular concern over a recent, potentially 
dangerous, demonstration at the Ambassador's Residence.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) The Ambassador was invited to have lunch with 
President Correa shortly after the new Foreign Minister, 
Fander Falconi, commented within days of the Obama 
inauguration that there was a "golden opportunity" for 
Ecuador to increase and noticeably improve its bilateral 
relations with the U.S.  Correa was accompanied at the lunch, 
which took place on January 26, by his communications advisor 
Vinicio Alvarado, Coordinating Minister for Production Susana 
Cabeza de Vaca, and the new Deputy Foreign Minister Lautaro 
Pozo.  When Correa realized that the Ambassador was 
unaccompanied, he asked Information Officer Marta Youth to 
join the group. 
 
¶3.  (C) It was immediately clear it was Correa's intention to 
have a friendly lunch.  Most of the conversation evolved 
around Ecuadorian domestic issues including the previous 
day's PAIS primaries, reforms the Correa Administration has 
carried out or wants to (taxation, company profit-sharing, 
etc.), his vision for PAIS (he hopes it never becomes a party 
since they had formed PAIS to fight against the "caciques" of 
the traditional parties).  U.S.-related discussions ranged 
from Correa's best wishes for the Obama administration, to 
his high regard for Secretary Clinton ("a very intelligent 
women"), to admiration for Senator McCain ("he was a 
formidable candidate"), to interest in the process of 
appointing U.S. ambassadors, political and career. 
 
¶4.  (C) Correa asked about the new embassy.  The Ambassador 
noted that one advantage was that demonstrators didn't bother 
to make their way to the new site.  (Correa: "I'm not 
surprised ) they're a lazy bunch.")  But, the Ambassador 
added, the problem is that now they come to the Residence. 
She went on to describe the January 3 anti-Israel 
demonstration at the Residence including the spray-painting 
of the perimeter walls and an individual waving a gun. 
Correa reacted immediately, expressing deep concern.  Picking 
up his personal voice recorder, he dictated, "I want a report 
on the demonstration at the American Ambassador's residence." 
 He also expressed dismay that the police had delayed in 
their arrival.  (Comment:  Clearly the news of the 
demonstration made an impression, or Correa wanted to show 
that it made an impression.  When the Ambassador was leaving, 
Correa walked her to the elevator where he saw her bodyguard 
and another national policeman, and told them how shocked he 
was not to have heard about the demonstration.  End comment.) 
 
¶5. (C) Finally the Ambassador said she wanted to raise 
something she had discussed with Vinicio Alvarado (reftel B). 
 Correa asked her to proceed.  The Ambassador said that she 
was aware that in discussions with Ambassador Jewell, Correa 
had left the door slightly open to some sort of post-FOL 
counternarcotics cooperation.  The U.S. was interested in 
knowing whether a "gas-and-go" type arrangement might be 
possible.  She described the agreement with Panama, whereby 
the Coast Guard flew into Panama, re-fueled, overnighted and 
continued their counternarcotics mission.  When she finished 
her pitch, Correa affirmatively said, "Whatever it takes to 
fight narcotics trafficking."  (Comment:  a word of caution: 
although he used these words, Correa was clearly only 
agreeing to a gas-and-go arrangement.  End comment.)  He 
added that an arrangement with civilians was a possibility. 
The Ambassador asked about follow-up.  Correa agreed that 
Deputy Minister Pozo would be the point of contact. 
(Ambassador has an appointment on February 2 to see Pozo.) 
 
¶6. (C) Correa then said, "Since we are talking business, 
let's talk about ATPA.  Ecuador would like to find a way to 
get away from the uncertainties of the ATPA extensions."  The 
Ambassador said that she fully understood the difficulties 
that Ecuador had experienced with the short extensions.  She 
noted that at least the last extension had been for a year, 
with the proviso the Executive branch could review Ecuador's 
performance in six months.  She pointed out that it was not 
entirely clear whether the Congress expected the review.  In 
any case, she explained that, after trips to rose farms where 
she saw how many women were employed in jobs affected by 
ATPA, she was a strong supporter of greater certainty for the 
exporters.  But she cautioned Correa that Congress might find 
trade preference extensions easier to deal with than some 
other yet-to-be designed trade framework.  Furthermore, 
Peru's free trade agreement, and Colombia's pending 
agreement, might leave Ecuador alone in its quest for 
something different.  She suggested Ecuador talk to its 
friends in Congress to explore what might be possible. 
¶7. (C) Comment:  It was apparent that Correa wanted to show 
his best intentions for good relations with the U.S.  It may 
be that we are once again seeing the "take shots at the U.S. 
in public, make nice in private" Correa that we have seen 
before.  Or, it could be that our stiff lecture to Foreign 
Minister Falconi (reftel A), and the balance of payments 
crisis, have helped focus attention by Correa on Ecuador's 
most important bilateral relationship.  In any event, we have 
a significant green light on important post-FOL cooperation, 
which we will pursue immediately.  Although Correa raised 
ATPA immediately after the Manta discussion, we did not get 
the impression that this was a quid-pro-quo.
