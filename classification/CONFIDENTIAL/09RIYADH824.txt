SUMMARY 
- - - - 
 
¶1. (C)  Saudi human rights activist Ibrahim Mugaiteeb told 
Poloff that the Kingdom's most pressing human rights issues 
were the status of women and the deteriorating situation of 
the Shi'a.  Founder of Human Rights First Society, Mugaiteeb 
urged the USG to press the SAG to recognize non-governmental 
organizations.  End Summary. 
 
 
WOMEN'S RIGHTS: LEGAL STATUS VS. THE RIGHT TO DRIVE 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶2. (C)  Saudi human rights activist Ibrahim Mugaiteeb met 
with Poloff on June 17 to discuss the current human rights 
situation in the Kingdom.  Mugaiteeb identified what he 
considered the two most pressing human rights issues: the 
status of women and the deteriorating situation of the Shi'a. 
 Noting that women comprise slightly more than 50% of the 
Saudi population, Mugaiteeb opined that the Saudi women's 
movement needed to focus on gaining independent legal 
identities equal to those of men.  Mugaiteeb feared the right 
to drive, which attracted a lot of media attention, was a 
dangerous distraction.  Western governments would likely view 
a change in this policy as a major success for Saudi women. 
In Mugaiteeb's opinion, however, the right to drive would 
have very little impact on the majority of Saudi women, since 
it would not eliminate the legal requirement for the 
permission of a related male that most women need to travel, 
work, own a business, etc. Changes to recognize and protect 
the legal status of women, on the other hand, would empower 
women to make basic choices about their lives. 
 
 
SHI'A SITUATION WORSENING 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶3.  (C)  Mugaiteeb, himself a Shi'a, averred that the 
situation of the Shi'a (who comprise about 10% of the Saudi 
population) had worsened in the past eighteen months. 
Mugaiteeb pointed to a number of incidents of religious and 
political discrimination: 
 
-- The recent closure of three Shi'a mosques/places of 
worship in al-Khobar which, although technically illegal due 
to a lack of government approval, had been in use for over 20 
years. 
 
-- The arrest of a prominent Shi'a cleric, Abdullah Saleh 
al-Muhanna, arrested in May for leading Friday prayers in a 
prayer place attached to his own home. 
 
-- The frequent jailing of Shi'a, including leading clerics 
such as Sheikh Tawfiq al-Amer, for the "offense" of adding 
the name of the Caliph Ali to the prayer call.  (NOTE: The 
call to prayer includes a declaration of Muslim beliefs i.e., 
"There is no god but God and Muhammad is his messenger."  The 
Shi'a like to add the phrase "and Ali is beloved of God," 
which many Wahhabis believe is blasphemous. End note.) 
 
-- The King's failure to appoint any Shi'a to senior 
positions during his February 14 cabinet reshuffle. 
 
-- The charge by an influential Sunni imam, Sheikh 
al-Kalbani, that Shi'a who did not agree with the Sunni view 
of the correct succession to the Prophet Muhammad were 
"infidels," which led to an outcry among Shi'a demanding his 
dismissal. 
 
Other recent events included the Baqi'a cemetery incident 
(Ref A, B, C and D) and protests in Awamiyya (Ref E), which 
have resulted in heightened tensions, especially in the 
Eastern Province. 
 
 
NGO'S MUST BE LEGITIMIZED BY LICENSING 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶4. (C)  Mugaiteeb raised the issue of the Saudi government's 
refusal to license NGO's in the Kingdom as a major roadblock 
for advancing human rights.  Mugaiteeb's organization, Human 
Rights First Society (HRFS), is a widely-recognized private 
human rights organization, but it lacks legitimacy and 
struggles for funding because the Saudi government refuses to 
issue the organization an official license.  HRFS applied for 
a license on three separate occasions, and on each occasion, 
the Saudi government denied the license.  Mugaiteeb, who is 
in very poor health, expressed his worry that no member of 
HRFS is willing to step forward and help shoulder the 
responsibility of running the organization out of fear of the 
Saudi government since HRFS is not a legitimate organization. 
 Mugaiteeb also claimed that although many EU countries have 
been very active in supporting HRFS and human rights in the 
Kingdom, he noted that "the U.S. is the only country that has 
the power to really do something."  Mugaiteeb asserted U.S. 
support is essential if HRFS is to be successful in obtaining 
a license, thereby legitimizing the work of the organization 
and the human rights movement in the Kingdom. 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - 
 
¶5. (C)  There is an atmosphere of distrust amongst activists, 
and fear of the Saudi government, which hampers the 
development of an effective human rights movement.  Until 
organizations such as HRFS are officially recognized by the 
Saudi government, ordinary Saudis will be reluctant to engage 
openly to advance human rights.
