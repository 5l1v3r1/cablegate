Panama to Continue Dip Recognition of Taiwan 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (U)  Panama would continue to recognize diplomatic Taiwan 
and to sustain commercial ties with China, Panamanian 
Presidency Secretary of State Communications Erich Rodriguez 
Auerbach confirmed to the press on June 7.  A communique 
released by the MFA the same day stated: 
 
"The Government of the Republic of Panama indicated today 
that it respected the sovereign decision of Costa Rica whose 
president, Oscar Arias, announced yesterday the breaking of 
diplomatic relations with Taiwan. 
 
"The Secretary of State Communications, Erich Rodriguez 
Auerbach, confirmed that the Administration of President 
Martin Torrijos Espino would maintain its current policy that 
sustains commercial relations with China and diplomatic ties 
with Taiwan.

¶2.  (C) Post continues to assess that Panama will not change 
its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in the near 
term and that no change is likely before the end of President 
Torrijos' term on September 1, 2009.  Currently, Panama's 
highest priority in its bilateral relationship with the U.S. 
is securing the adoption of the recently concluded Trade 
Promotion Agreement (TPA).  Anxiously counting votes on 
Capitol Hill, Panama does not wish to alienate pro-Taiwan 
U.S. Congressman.  Furthermore, Panama currently sustains 
beneficial ties with both Taipei and Beijing -- ties that 
include important aid and extensive commercial activity-- and 
other and does not see a benefit to rearranging its 
diplomatic recognition at this time.  The fact that Rodriguez 
made this announcement from the Presidency underscores 
Panama's desire to maintain the status quo on this matter. 
Furthermore, Panama's quick reaction to Costa Rica's 
announcement suggests that Panama knew Arias' decision was 
coming and wished to quickly put to bed any speculation that 
Panama was contemplating a similar shift.  Post will pulse 
its China-watcher contacts to assess further Panama's 
position on this matter.
