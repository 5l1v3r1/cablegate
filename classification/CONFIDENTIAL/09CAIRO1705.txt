Classified By: DCM Matthew H.  Tueller for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
1.(C) Key Points: -- Arab League (AL) SYG Amr Moussa said that the situation in Darfur has improved and a resolution to the crisis is possible in the near term. -- The AL seeks to "coordinate, consult, and cooperate" with the USG on Sudan. -- As the referendum approaches, Special Envoy (S/E) Gration and Moussa agreed on the need to make unity attractive while securing the right of the South to vote for self determination. They also agreed that there must be efforts to resolve tribal conflicts, and help southern leaders to create a viable infrastructure. ------------------------- Everything Points to Doha -------------------------

2.(C) In an August 23 meeting with S/E Gration, AL SYG Moussa praised the new U.S. approach to Sudan as key to improving the humanitarian situation in Darfur. He encouraged continued focus on the Doha process, noting that the AL and African Union (AU) had been the first to support the role of Qatar in resolving the Darfur crisis. Moussa said a solution to Darfur is possible before Sudanese elections in April 2010. He invited S/E Gration to attend a meeting of the Arab African Committee during the UNGA, where Moussa, U.N. SYG Ban, AU Chairman Jean Ping, AU/UN Mediator Djibril Bassole, and 16 Arab and African foreign ministers will meet to discuss solutions for Darfur. Moussa stated the AL is ready to "coordinate consult, and cooperate" with the USG on Sudan.

3.(C) Gration thanked Moussa for AL support on Sudan. He stated that he is optimistic about the improving situation in Darfur because the USG has established a working relationship with Khartoum. This allowed the U.N. and NGOs to expand their capacity and the Government of Sudan (GoS) to agree to bring in new NGOs to address the humanitarian crisis. In addition, Gration noted that Libya is playing a positive role in uniting the Darfuri factions and mediating between Sudan and Chad. Gration said that Minni Minawi, with forces on the ground, still had the potential to be a "spoiler." Though Minawi has been sidelined because he signed the Darfur Peace Agreement in May 2006, there will probably need to be an accommodation for him and his forces. Gration stressed the need to compress the timeline to end the crisis in Darfur stating that a peace agreement must be in place by the end of 2009. ----------------------------------- Significant Challenges in the South -----------------------------------

4.(C) Gration told Moussa that major challenges remain in the south. He stated that "the north is pushing for unity while the south is planning for secession." Gration said efforts need to focus on how the two sides can coexist, whether united or separate. Both Gration and Moussa agreed that much needs to be done to make unity attractive, resolve tribal conflicts, and help southern leaders to create a viable economic, political, health, aviation, and communication infrastructure.

5.(C) Moussa told Gration that the AL was working to convince Arab companies to invest in southern Sudan. However, he said that this challenge was similar to efforts on Iraq because the investors see the opportunities in South Sudan, but fear for their security. Moussa suggested organizing an "Investment Conference" in southern Sudan to attract investors from Arab states, Africa, Europe and the U.S.
