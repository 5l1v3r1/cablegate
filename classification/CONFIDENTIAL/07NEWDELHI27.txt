SUBJECT: INDIA RESPONDS FAVORABLY TO PARTNERSHIP FOR 
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE PROPOSAL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 181366 
 
Classified By: DCM Geoff Pyatt for Reasons 1.4 (B,D) 
 
¶1.  (C) DCM received a letter dated December 20, 2006 from 
Manjeev Singh Puri, Ministry of External Affairs Joint 
Secretary (UN Economic and Social), responding to Ambassador 
 
SIPDIS 
Mulford's letter of November 6, 2006 inviting India to 
participate in the "Core Group" meeting to help shape the 
"Partnership for Democratic Governance."  Puri wrote, "I am 
writing to confirm that we would like to participate in the 
proposed meeting and would request that this is conveyed to 
those concerned." 
 
¶2.  (C) Comment: This positive response suggests a continued 
gradual evolution by India in the direction of collaborating 
on democracy promotion, as previewed in Foreign Secretary 
Shiv Shankar Menon's discussions with Under Secretaries Burns 
and Dobriansky last month.  End comment. 
 
¶3.  (U) Action request:  Post requests guidance from the 
Department on next steps, ideally tied to both the 
Partnership proposal and our plan for an early meeting of the 
U.S.-India Global Issues Forum.
