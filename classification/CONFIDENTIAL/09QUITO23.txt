¶1.  (C) Summary:  Following his participation in President Correa's 
trip to Iran in December, an Ecuadorian business leader explained to 
Emboff how potential commerce with Iran could work.  To disguise 
trade with Iran, goods would be routed through Singapore and payments 
through Dubai.  Funds from the Export Development Bank of Iran loan 
to Ecuador were not yet available; the Embassy plans to notify 
Ecuador's business community of the Bank's status as U.S.-designated. 
 End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) At the end of December, Emboff met with the head of Ecuador's 
public-private export promotion agency, Ricardo Estrada, who 
accompanied President Correa on his December 5-9 trip to Iran.  The 
visit of Correa's 95-member delegation, the first by an Ecuadorian 
president, was part of his effort to increase political and economic 
ties with Iran (ref A).  Estrada discussed the trip and how trading 
with Iran could potentially work. 
 
¶3.  (C) During the visit, the Export Development Bank of Iran (EDBI) 
approved a $40 million line-of-credit for Ecuador.  Estrada told us 
that his understanding was that the EDBI loan was only for imports 
from Iran, although he had not been involved closely with the 
transaction.  At the end of December, as far as he knew, the funds 
were not yet available to Ecuador. 
 
¶4.  (C) Estrada explained how trading with Iran would physically 
occur.  The trade would be circuitous so that transactions would not 
be readily identifiable as being with Iran.  Trade would be routed 
through Singapore, which he reported was Iran's logistics hub.  He 
said that Iran had a very large fleet of cargo ships (147 vessels) 
based in Singapore.  For example, an Iranian ship could bring urea 
(powdered fertilizer) to Ecuador, possibly receive subsidized fuel in 
Ecuador (per Correa's offer to subsidize trade between the two 
countries), and return with a shipload of Ecuadorian bananas. 
Fertilizer and bananas were the most likely products to be traded, he 
claimed, and noted that it would be inexpensive to ship from Ecuador 
using Iran's fleet and that bananas could easily last 30 days in 
transit.  Payments would be routed through Dubai, reportedly Iran's 
money hub, he said. 
 
STATISTICS ON ECUADOR'S TRADE WITH IRAN 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) According to data from Ecuador's Central Bank, trade with 
Iran increased significantly in 2008, virtually all of which was 
imports of petroleum derivatives from Iran.  Ecuadorian exports to 
Iran were zero in 2006 and 2007.  In 2008, Ecuador exported $14,000 
worth of goods to Iran; almost all of this was citrus fruit purees, 
with $110 worth of roses exported.  Companies that exported to Iran 
in 2008 were Industrias Borja Inborja, S.A., and Terraroses CIA., 
Ltda.  In 2007 Ecuador imported $21,000 in construction stone 
(alabaster, etc).  In 2008, with the bulk of imports starting in 
August, Ecuador imported $201.3 million from Iran, with $201 million 
of that being petroleum derivative products.  Petroecuador (Ecuador's 
state oil company) is the only recognizable petroleum company listed 
on the Central Bank list of importers from Iran, and is probably the 
importer of the petroleum products.  Other importers included the 
Commercial Office of the Iranian Embassy, a few Ecuadorian and 
Arabic-named companies, and Bristol Myers Squibb of Ecuador 
(subsidiary of U.S. Bristol Myers Squibb). 
 
COMMENT: 
-------- 
 
¶6.  (C) Estrada told us that the business people on the trip to Iran 
were investigating trade opportunities with Iran largely because of 
pressure from President Correa, but were extremely reluctant to do 
anything that might jeopardize their business opportunities with the 
U.S.  We have already alerted the GOE to the EDBI designation under 
E.O. 13382 (ref B).  Since it appears that the EDBI loan will be used 
for imports from Iran, we plan to notify Ecuador's business community 
of the designation as well, so that they are fully aware of the 
implications of being involved with the EDBI.
