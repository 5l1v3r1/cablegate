(C) In a January 28 conversation with Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Trade (MFAT) Northeast Asia Director David
Taylor, A/DCM reviewed reftel points regarding Taiwan.
Taylor responded that much of the USG argument "could have
been drafted by our people." The GNZ, he said, shares the
view that it is inappropriate to lock Taiwan out of processed
where there is wider benefit to its participation, and the
MFAT official cited the OIE and the WHO as two additional
examples.
