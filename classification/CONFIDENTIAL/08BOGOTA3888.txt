SUMMARY 
------- 
Â¶1.  (C)  Maria del Pilar Hurtado, director of Colombia's
Administrative Department of Security (DAS), resigned on 
October 22 after opposition Senator Gustavo Petro publicly 
revealed internal DAS documents that tasked officials to 
gather intelligence on Petro and on his party, the Polo 
Democratico (PDA).  Hurtado's initially blamed a subordinate 
for issuing the order and announced his dismissal.   She also 
denied that she or President Uribe had prior knowledge of the 
order.  Still, Hurtado later resigned as an "act of public 
service."  Casa de Narino insiders believe Hurtado was 
already on her way out; the spy scandal merely accelerated 
her departure.  Colombian National Police (CNP) Commander 
Naranjo told us presidential advisor Jose ObdulioGaviria
pushed the DAS to collect political intelligence, and he 
predicted the political fallout from the scandal will 
continue.  End Summary.
