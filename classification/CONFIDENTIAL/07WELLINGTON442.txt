REF: STATE 71547 
 
Classified By: Acting DCM Katherine B. Hadda, 
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) Acting DCM and A/P-E couns delivered reftel request 
to Paul Ash, Deputy Director of the Security Policy and 
Disarmament Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade.  We conveyed Washington's appreciation for New 
Zealand's continued positive role in Afghanistan. 
 
¶2.  (C) Ash said that although New Zealand cannot commit 
addtional military forces, GNZ officials will review the 
request list carefully to see if there are any possible 
contributions that the GNZ can make.  He also said that New 
Zealand is about to start its annual Cabinet-level review of 
Peacekeeping Operations.  One goal of this year's review will 
be to improve coordination among Ministries so that all NZ 
officials are better informed about -- and can better explain 
to us -- New Zealand's military and non-military 
contributions to global PKO activities. 
 
¶3.  (C) FYI: Ash will leave Wellington in December for 
Brussels, where he will serve as NZ's Deputy Chief of 
Mission.  End FYI.
