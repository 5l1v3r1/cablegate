ALLEGED ANTI-CHAVEZ PLOT 
 
CARACAS 00001676  001.2 OF 002 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR FRANCISCO FERNANDEZ 
FOR REASON 1.4 (D) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary. The National Assembly (NA) released a report 
calling on the Attorney General's Office (AG) to investigate 
retired military personnel, independent media owners, and 
businessmen for their supposed involvement in a conspiracy to 
assassinate President Chavez.  It accused the USG of 
providing funds to destabilize Venezuela.  The report also 
urged Conatel, the telecommunications agency, to investigate 
private media outlets for purportedly conducting a systematic 
campaign to discredit Chavez and promote his assassination. 
NA deputies implored the government to look into the 
activities of the Embassy's five American Corners.  The 
report provides no real evidence but relies heavily on 
hearsay, transcripts from recorded messages between member of 
the opposition, and accusations that the free media is 
employing subliminal messages.  The NA has now shifted its 
focus to proposing an amendment to the constitution that 
would allow for Chavez's indefinite re-election.  End 
Summary.

NA Releases Findings on Chavez Plot 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The NA's "Special Committee to Investigate a Coup 
and Assassination Attempt Against President Chavez," which 
was formed in late September, released its findings in a 
100-page report on December 2.  The Committee was formed 
after Mario Silva, an ardent Chavista talk show host, 
broadcast a recording of alleged phone conversations between 
Army MGEN Wilfredo Barroso Herrera, VADM Millan Millian, and 
Air Force BGEN Eduardo Baez Torrealba.  The alleged voices 
spoke of seizing Miraflores using F-16s, state-controlled 
television stations, and the Naval Headquarters.  Silva also 
named former Defense Minister Raul Isaias Baduel and 
Globovision owner Alberto Federico Ravell in the supposed 
plot. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The report, which was placed on the back burner in 
the lead-up to the November state and local elections, 
focused on the alleged role of retired and active duty 
military officers, prominent figures in civil society, and 
the USG to discredit Chavez and thus justify a disruption in 
the constitutional order of power and ultimately Chavez's 
murder.  The report relied heavily on the use of questionable 
witness testimony and possibly illegally-recorded telephone 
and text messages. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Regarding the involvement of military personnel, the 
report states that the GBRV's intelligence apparatus 
"squashed" the plot mentioned by Silva but that further 
threats remain.  NA deputies urged the government to continue 
its on-going investigation against the men named by Silva and 
their possible associates. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The report's other primary target was civil society 
leaders, predominately private media owners.  Miguel Henrique 
Otero, owner of daily El Nacional, Marcel Granier, director 
of Radio Caracas Television, Diego Arria, Baduel, Nelson 
Mezerhane, head of Fedecamaras, Ravell, Rafael Poleo, editor 
of the daily Un Nuevo Pais, and mayor-elect of Maracaibo 
Manuel Rosales were named as the supposed leaders of the 
civilian front to destabilize the Government of the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (GBRV) and promote the 
assassination of Chavez. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Specifically, these persons are accused of 
discrediting Chavez and his government in the independent 
media and business circles and in so doing justify his 
assassination.  The report lists instances where media 
outlets purportedly call for Chavez's murder through cheeky 
news headlines or the use of subliminal messages.  It calls 
on Conatel to investigate these instances and sanction the 
networks if necessary.  Likewise, it urges the Human Rights 
Ombudsman to protect citizens "from discriminatory messages 
that disrupt peace and social harmony."  In its 
recommendations the Committee advocated that the AG's Office 
open an investigation against the individuals mentioned and 
present criminal charges if warranted. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Committee also repeatedly made mention of the 
USG's supposed efforts to finance destabilization projects 
against the GBRV.  The report named local NGO partners and 
accused them of carrying out the "empire's" agenda.  The 
report called on the government to investigate the USG's 
installation of five "virtual consulates (American Corners) 
without the permission of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs." 
According to the report, the USG fears the repercussions that 
the Bolivarian Revolution could have in the region and around 
the world, as motives for its purported actions against 
Venezuela.

Tascon: Report Doesn't Hold Water 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) According to the media, NA Deputy and expelled PSUV 
member Luis Tascon, creator of the infamous Tascon List, said 
the report "lacked substance" and requested that the 
Committee be allowed more time to present evidence against 
the supposed conspirators.  He warned that the report would 
be used against the NA because the arguments presented were 
too weak.  Nevertheless, the report was approved by all 
deputies, with the exception of the Podemos party. 
 
¶9. (SBU) After releasing the report, deputies from the 
pro-government NA set out to formulate a proposal to amend 
the constitution to allow for Chavez's indefinite reelection. 
 Chavez originally granted his PSUV party permission to take 
up the issue via a signature drive.  The NA, however, 
recently agreed to assume the task.  According to the 
constitution, thirty parliamentarian are needed to approve 
the measure, which will later be put to a popular referendum. 
 
¶10. (C) Comment: The GBRV routinely employs a variety of 
tactics to discredit its adversaries.  In this instance, the 
National Assembly has synthesized a series of politically 
motivated charges without presenting any real evidence. 
Moreover, this case is significant given that the government 
has requested the formal investigation of several prominent 
business, media, and civil society leaders.  The GBRV's 
release of private conversations in the public media is 
particularly worrisome and confirms reports we've heard from 
contacts that the government is actively conducting 
surveillance on opposition members.  End Comment.
