TAGS: PGOV PREL PTER VZ CO
SUBJECT: GOC PLEASED WITH INTERPOL CONFIRMATION OF 
AUTHENTICITY OF FARC-REYES COMPUTERS 

REF: BOGOTA 1714 

Classified By: Classified by Acting Political Counselor David M. Zimov
Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 

¶1. (U) Interpol Secretary General Ronald Kenneth Noble said 
at a May 15 press conference in Bogota that Colombia did not 
tamper in any way with files on computers seized after the 
March 1 raid on Raul Reyes FARC camp in Ecuador.  Noble said 
Interpol is "absolutely certain that the computer exhibits 
our experts examined came from a FARC terrorist camp." 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez denounced Interpol's 
conclusions, and called the press conference a "clown show." 


¶2. (U) Noble said there are over 38,000 files are on the 
three Toshiba laptop computers, two hard disc drives and 
three USB memory sticks that belonged to the FARC's 
former-second-in-command.  Interpol said there were 37,872 
written documents, 452 spreadsheets, and 210,888 images on 
the computers.  It took Interpol two weeks running 10 
computers simultaneously to break into encrypted files on the 
computers.  Interpol said the data was the equivalent of 39.4 
million pages of word documents. 

¶3. (C) Vice Minister of Defense Sergio Jaramillo, who is
managing the GOC's strategy on the use of Reyes computer 
information, told us the GOC is pleased with the outcome of 
the Interpol effort.   He said the GOC's targeted leaks of 
information from the computers over the past month had worked 
well, but he thinks the best thing the GOC can do is remain 
quiet after the Interpol announcement and allow Chavez to 
talk.  Jaramillo said enough incriminating evidence has been 
leaked; the next step is to brief additional countries on the 
findings and begin domestic prosecutions--likely by the end 
of May.  Jaramillo also reiterated the GOC's request that the 
USG maintain a low profile, especially in regard to Latin 
American countries.  He added that U.S. reinforcement or 
discussion with EU countries on the Reyes computer data would 
be helpful.
