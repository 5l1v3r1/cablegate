MANDATE 
 
REF: A. STATE 59451 B. STATE 57896 C. CAIRO 1014 D. STATE 55852 Classified By: Economic-Political Minister-Counselor William R. Stewart for reason 1.4 (b).
1.(C) On June 9, we demarched MFA Deputy Director for Human Rights Omar Shalaby on agreeing to a short UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution text calling for a one-year extension of the special rapporteur's mandate and allowing humanitarian access (ref B). Shalaby replied that the Sudanese government is "adamant" about not renewing the special rapporteur's mandate, and that the GOE is discussing the issue with the GOS. He said the GOE needs "to give the benefit of the doubt" to the GOS because the human rights situation has "improved somewhat" (NFI). Shalaby predicted that the special rapporteur's mandate would be extended, but not for an additional year. Shalaby said the language on humanitarian access in the current EU draft "looks fine." He noted that any potential language on the International Criminal Court would be "explosive." Per ref B instruction, we responded that the U.S. recommends there be no ICC reference.

2.(C) We followed up with Shalaby June 10 and 11 to urge a streamlined resolution text (ref A). He replied that he had passed our June 9 points to the Egyptian Mission in Geneva, and that the mission is working on a resolution text. Shalaby said the "highest levels of the Sudanese government" are "still not budging" on extending the special rapporteur's mandate. He offered his personal analysis that the GOS feels it has nothing to lose after the ICC indictment of President Bashir.

3.(C) Shalaby noted that because the previous extension of the rapporteur was for six months, a one-year extension would constitute a "negative report card" for the Sudanese government. We responded that paragraph 60 of the UNHRC Institution Building package states that country-specific mandates are to be renewed for one year, and that the U.S. still has serious concerns about the human rights situation in Sudan (ref A). Shalaby said that a precedent for mandate extensions of less than one year was set by the previous six-month extension. He noted that the GOE will continue discussions with the GOS, and will call for an Africa Group meeting on the issue "very soon." SCOBEY
