SUBJECT: CLUSTER MUNITIONS:  GREECE SHARES U.S. CONCERNS 
 
REF: STATE 164503 
 
Classified By: A/Political Counselor Jeff Hovenier for 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) A/Pol Counselor met 12/12 with MFA Senior 
Non-Proliferation Officer Dionyssios Kyvetos to deliver ref 
papers on cluster munitions.  Kyvetos, who attended the 
December 5 - 7 meeting in Vienna of the Oslo Process, was 
unequivocal in reply:  Greece strongly supports U.S. concerns 
about the Oslo Process.  Greece participated in the Vienna 
meeting, but at that meeting announced it would no longer 
attend meetings of the Oslo Process.  Greece is fully 
committed to negotiations on cluster munitions within the 
Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) framework, 
and will be chairing some of these negotiations.  Greece 
further shares USG concerns that there are provisions being 
considered within the Oslo Process that could have a 
significant impact on military cooperation between countries 
that adopt such requirements related to cluster munitions and 
those that do not.  He said "we are with you," and he asked 
that U.S. officials keep Greek officials -- and in particular 
the Greek Ambassador in Geneva -- informed of U.S. concerns 
and activities in this area. 
 
¶2.  (C) Kyvetos also noted that the EU is facing "significant 
coordination problems" on cluster munitions issues.  EU 
states have agreed to work on this issue within the CCW 
framework.  Therefore, Greece was surprised and disappointed 
by a draft statement by EU/Portugal for the Vienna Meeting of 
the Oslo Process that made no reference to CCW.  Greece 
blocked this statement on this basis, and Greece will object 
to any future EU signals of support for the Oslo Process. 
Kyvetos singled out Ireland, Austria, and Sweden are among 
the most enthusiastic about the Oslo Process.
