¶1. (C) The Czech government has formally denied the license request of a Czech arms dealer to broker the sale of Russian KH-31 missiles, now in the possession of a state-run firm in Belarus, to the U.S. Navy. Poloff was told April 1st that the MFA licensing office had on March 31 sent a formal letter to the office within the Ministry of Industry and Trade which is responsible for arms sales, informing it of the MFA's decision. To confirm this, ХХХХХХХХХХХХХХХХХ, called his counterpart at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, who told him that no license has been approved, or will be approved for this transaction.
