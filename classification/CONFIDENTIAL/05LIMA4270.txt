¶1.  (C)  The Ambassador, on 9/28, phoned Prime Minister Pedro 
Pablo Kuczynski (who was out of the country) to explain why 
it is so important that Peru pay 68,600 Euros towards its 
OPCW dues.  Kuczynski grasped the point immediately when the 
Ambassador mentioned that the chair might otherwise fall to 
Venezuela and said he would deal with it.  Kuczynski added 
that he would either get back to the Ambassador directly with 
confirmation that the necessary actions had been taken or ask 
that Finance Minister Fernando Zavala do so. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Polcouns, on 9/28, informed Julio Garro, the Foreign 
Ministry's Director of Multilateral Affairs, of the 
Ambassador's talk with the Prime Minister.  Garro was pleased 
at the news and said he would work with the Finance Ministry 
to process the payment as soon as possible.
