Three Panamanian Ministers to Visit FM Rodriguez
--------------------------------------------- ----

¶1.  (C) Vice President/Foreign Minister Samuel Lewis called
POL Counselor July 5 to let us know that he plans a one-day
visit to Venezuela tomorrow, July 6, to meet with Venezuelan
Foreign Minister Ali Rodriguez to "review" the bilateral
relationship.  Minister of Government and Justice Hector
Aleman and Minister of Commerce and Industry Alejandro Ferrer
will accompany Lewis.  The two foreign ministers will issue a
joint statement after the meeting.

Oil and Security
----------------

¶2.  (C) Lewis described two reasons for his trip:

- to discuss "oil and gas cooperation.  Essentially, Panama
wants in on the Petrocaribe deal for cut-rate oil, gasoline,
transportation, and finance that Venezuela signed with
Caribbean countries in late June (Reftel A), and

- to open a "channel of communication" on security matters to
assure Panama that Venezuela will not support the GOP's
radical opponents.

Venezuela's six-month-old proposal to refurbish a
U.S.-operated oil pipeline in western Panama to carry
Venezuelan crude to Puerto Armuelles on the Pacific coast
(Reftel B) has been on the back burner for months but Lewis
said he would not be surprised if the Venezuelans raise it.

¶3.  (C) Lewis acknowledged the possibility that President
Chavez could visit Panama in conjunction with the July 29,
2005 Association of Caribbean States summit.

Comment
-------

¶4.  (C) Cash-strapped Panama is no more immune to the allure
of lower oil and gasoline prices than its Caribbean
neighbors.  A deal on oil and gasoline will naturally
increase Venezuela's political and economic leverage, so
Lewis wants to cement an understanding that Chavez will steer
clear of Panama's internal politics.

¶5.  (C) Ambassador Watt will have the opportunity to discuss
Venezuela matters more fully with President Torrijos and
Foreign Minister Lewis at a Friday, July 8 farewell dinner
hosted by the president.
