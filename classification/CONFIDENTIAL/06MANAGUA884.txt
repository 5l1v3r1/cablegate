ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. AMBASSADOR BROWNFIELD 
 
REF: A. STATE 60604

     ¶C. AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) On April 20, Ambassador shared with Nicaraguan 
Foreign Minister Norman Caldera the pattern of harassment 
directed by the Venezuelan government against U.S. Ambassador 
to Venezuela, William R. Brownfield, most recently when 
Ambassador Brownfield was donating baseball equipment to a 
Little League team in a poor Venezuelan neighborhood. 
Caldera, who was cognizant of the incident, and concurred 
that these are not spontaneous incidents, informed the 
Ambassador that the Nicaraguan government shares our 
condemnation of the failure of the Venezuelan government to 
meet Vienna Convention obligations to protect foreign 
diplomats. 
 
¶2.  (C) On the subject of the Venezuelan government, Foreign 
Minister Caldera noted Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez' 
increasing influence in Nicaragua, specifically Chavez' 
interest in Sandinista (FSLN) leader Daniel Ortega's winning 
the November election.  Terming the Venezuelan government's 
initiative to provide oil to certain Sandinista-run 
municipalities in Nicaragua with attractive loan terms a 
political ploy to support Ortega's candidacy, Caldera 
questioned the feasibility of such a venture.  He explained 
that a loan to the GON  would  require the approval of 
Nicaragua's National Assembly, but the Sandinistas do not 
have enough votes on their own to approve the venture. 
Further, Caldera doubted that Nicaragua possesses the 
infrastructure to implement the project before the November 
elections.
