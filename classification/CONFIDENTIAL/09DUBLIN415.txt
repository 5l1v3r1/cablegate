Classified By: Ambassador Daniel M. Rooney.  Reasons 1.4(b/d). 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On September 30, Ambassador Rooney met with 
Ireland's Permanent Representative to the EU, Rory 
Montgomery, and separately with Irish European Commissioner 
Charlie McCreevy (Internal Market and Services).  In 
wide-ranging discussions about the EU and Ireland, the 
Ambassador and his interlocutors touched on the October 2 
Lisbon Treaty referendum and who might get the new top jobs 
in the EU if Lisbon comes into effect, possible Irish 
candidates for the 2009-2014 European Commission, the EU and 
the G-20, the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), and 
the upcoming budget debate in Ireland.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------ 
LISBON: "'YES'" WILL WIN 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (C) Both Montgomery and McCreevy were confident the "yes" 
vote would win out in the October 2 Lisbon Treaty referendum 
(ref A).  Montgomery, while predicting about a 60-40 spread 
in favor of Lisbon, cautioned that everyone he talks to is 
pro-Lisbon.  Continuing in that vein, Montgomery noted the 
"disturbing gulf" on Lisbon that he said seemed to be 
manifesting itself between the pro-Lisbon elites and 
lower-income groups, as well as between the pro-Lisbon 
40-and-up age groups and the young.  Montgomery worried that 
these splits could be a symptom of an increasingly divided 
Irish society. 
 
--------------------------- 
WHO MIGHT FILL NEW EU JOBS? 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) If Lisbon passes and goes into effect, Montgomery 
said, one of the first questions the EU would face would be 
who would fill the new top EU jobs foreseen in the treaty. 
He said former British PM Tony Blair was the top candidate 
for the new post of President of the European Council, for 
lack of other viable candidates of that stature.  If Blair 
did go for the post, said Montgomery, Ireland would be 
obliged to support him in recognition of his extraordinary 
efforts as PM to bring peace to Northern Ireland. 
 
¶4. (C) Montgomery said there were several candidates for the 
new "EU Foreign Minister" post.  He first mentioned Finnish 
Commissioner for Enlargement Olli Rehn, who he characterized 
as low-key but competent and well respected.  Montgomery said 
also that Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt was a viable 
candidate, along with former Commissioner for External 
Relations Chris Patten.  Since Patten is British, cautioned 
Montgomery, Patten would be considered only if his compatriot 
Tony Blair were not named to the President post. 
 
--------------------------- 
NEXT IRISH EU COMMISSIONER? 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) Montgomery and McCreevy also analyzed how the Irish 
nominee for the 2009-2014 European Commission would be 
chosen.  McCreevy, a current Commissioner, said that one 
complicating factor was uncertainty as to when or if Lisbon 
would go into effect.  If Czech President Vaclav Klaus delays 
further his signing of the treaty, Lisbon's status could 
remain unclear for months beyond the Irish referendum 
(reftels).  McCreevy speculated that, regardless of whether 
Lisbon's status is resolved within the next few months, the 
EU would probably soon call for one nominee from each member 
state, as foreseen by Lisbon under the agreement between 
Ireland and the rest of the EU.  Both of our interlocutors 
stressed that Prime Minister Cowen would be the key 
decision-maker in nominating the next Commissioner, and that 
Cowen would first face a difficult decision.  Montgomery put 
it as follows: as a "matter of the heart," Cowen would prefer 
to nominate someone from his own party, the centrist Fianna 
Fail (FF); however, as a "matter of the head," Cowen's 
choices in FF were all members of parliament -- and 
nominating a member of parliament would require a by-election 
in that member's constituency that FF would likely lose. 
With a tenuous hold on a slim majority of seats in parliament 
and sagging poll numbers, said our interlocutors, Cowen and 
his FF could ill afford the risk of a by-election. 
 
¶6. (C) On who the Commissioner nominee might be, McCreevy 
professed to be uninvolved in the process, but speculated 
that FF nominees might be Minister for Transport Noel 
Dempsey, Vice Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, 
Enterprise and Employment Mary Coughlan, or Minister for

Health Mary Harney (NOTE: Harney is not a member of FF, but 
as a cabinet member she is nevertheless key to FF's continued 
hold on power.  END NOTE.)  While McCreevy professed not to 
know who the nominee might be if Cowen went outside FF, 
Montgomery mentioned former European Parliament President Pat 
Cox, who has also been a very visible pro-Lisbon campaigner. 
Montgomery said a less likely, but possible candidate was 
Ambassador to the U.S. John Bruton, a former Prime Minister 
and leading figure in the primary opposition party Fine Gael. 
 
-------------------------------- 
SMALLER EU MEMBERS' G-20 WORRIES 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (C) During a discussion of the Ambassador's attendance at 
the September 24-25 G-20 summit in his hometown of 
Pittsburgh, Montgomery remarked that mid-sized EU states, 
such as Poland, were concerned that G-20 members Great 
Britain, France, Germany and Italy "might not stick to the EU 
script" on financial and economic issues in the still 
relatively new and untested G-20 forum, thus lessening the 
influence of EU states who help decide EU positions within 
the EU but are left without direct representation in the G-20. 
 
------------------------------- 
BAD BANKS AND BUDGET IN IRELAND 
------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (C) On the upcoming establishment of the National Asset 
Management Agency (NAMA) that would buy and manage bad loans 
from banks, and the budget debate coming in December for a 
fiscally strapped Ireland (refs B-C), Montgomery (STRICTLY 
PROTECT) said that the EU was watching closely.  He said NAMA 
might prove to be a laboratory for other EU member states who 
could find themselves forced to stave off bank collapses with 
a similar policy.  The same went for the budget, he said, 
with other EU member states facing the need to make budget 
cuts that would be as drastic and painful as those Ireland 
would be facing in December.  Montgomery argued that the 
biggest cuts would come in public sector salaries, with 
Ireland (like other EU member states) paying "too many" civil 
servants "too much" to provide public services that could be 
provided for much less.  Other cuts, said Montgomery would be 
much more difficult and require perhaps more political will 
than could be mustered.  On NAMA and the budget, McCreevy, an 
ex-Finance Minister said simply that his experience taught 
him that the government needed to act quickly to keep the 
public and press from dwelling on the negative.  "If you 
wait," he said, "it'll only get worse."
