¶1. (SBU) Summary: After receiving a large majority of votes 
in the March 31 PLC "mini conventions," Jose Rizo was 
ratified by the PLC general convention on April 2 as the 
party's presidential candidate.  RizoQ,s large margin of 
victory (64%), as well as a last-minute change to divide 
voting into 32 local districts rather than one vote at the 
general convention (Ref B), was seen by many as proof that 
Jose Rizo is PLC leader Arnoldo AlemanQ,s "chosen one." 
After the vote, the other pre-candidates, initially critical 
of the new selection process forced on them, endorsed Rizo to 
maintain unity in the party.  Presidential candidates Eduardo 
Montealegre and Jose Antonio Alvarado also commented on the 
vote, with Montealegre proclaiming Rizo the hand-picked 
candidate of Aleman and Alvarado offering platitudes about 
Liberal unity.  End Summary. 
 
RIZO WINS BY SUSPICIOUSLY WIDE MARGIN

¶2. (U) With 720 of 738 possible votes counted by April 2, 
Jose Rizo took the lead with 463 (64.3%).  Enrique Quinonez 
came in a distant second with 124 votes (17.2%), followed by 
Ramiro Sacasa with 69 votes (9.6%), Francisco Aguirre Sacasa 
with 53 votes (7.4%), and Haroldo Montealegre with 11 votes 
(1.5%).  Out of 32 districts counted, Rizo lost only five: 
Carazo and Miami went to Quinonez; Ramiro Sacasa won one 
district in Nueva Segovia and Jinotega Q) RizoQ,s native 
department; and Francisco Aguirre Sacasa took the third 
district of Managua. 
 
¶3. (U) All of the pre-candidates except Rizo initially 
protested the decision of the PLC's Central Committee (CEN) 
to transfer the voting process from a secret vote at the PLC 
general convention to 32 "mini conventions," possibly with 
open voting, depending on the preference of the local 
convention members.  The other pre-candidates protested 
strongly (Ref B), stating that the vote would not be free of 
Aleman's influence, and eventually forced the CEN to agree 
that all of the voting would be private, though the 
"mini-conventions" remained.  Despite losing a process that 
many saw as clearly influenced by Aleman, all of the 
pre-candidates ultimately closed ranks and endorsed Rizo at 
the April 2 general convention.  Even Enrique Quinonez, one 
of the strongest opponents of the "mini-conventions" 
proclaimed, "There was no 'dedo' (Aleman's influence on the 
vote), long live Dr. Rizo!" 
 
¶4. (U) Jose Antonio Alvarado, presidential pre-candidate for 
APRE, equivocated when asked if he would consider becoming 
Rizo's vice presidential candidate, instead repeating his 
desire to promote "Liberal unity."  Alvarado confirmed that 
APRE is negotiating with both the PLC and ALN-PC to form an 
alliance and again mentioned proposals to use multi-party 
primaries to unite the anti-Sandinista forces. 
 
ALN-PC: PLC CONVENTIONS A "SHOW" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶5. (U) ALN-PC spokesman Eliseo Nunez called the PLC 
"mini-conventions" a "party show," claiming that all of the 
convention members were selected by Aleman.  Nunez claimed 
that Rizo's defeat in Jinotega was planned on purpose to try 
to give the vote an air of legitimacy.  (Note: We have heard 
repeatedly first hand that Rizo is not popular in Jinotega as 
locals blame him for not delivering any benefits to the 
department during his tenure as vice president.  End Note.) 
Eduardo Montealegre stated that the results clearly indicate 
that Jose Rizo is Aleman's "chosen one."  Rizo responded by 
enjoining the PLC to unite to defeat the FSLN and the "party 
of the bankers" (ALN-PC). 
 
COMMENT: TIME IS RIPE FOR PRIMARY PROPOSAL 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶6. (C) Rizo has repeatedly signaled his willingness to 
participate in primaries, whether internal or multi-party. 
Now that he has been designated as the PLC's candidate, we 
can use our primary proposal (Ref C) to test his resolve. 
Businessman Carlos Pellas told Ambassador on April 3 that he 
 
would support the primary proposal, financially if necessary, 
and encourage the candidates to accept the terms.  The PLC's 
response to the proposal will show if Rizo truly has the 
ability to direct the party away from Aleman, as he claims, 
or if he is merely a figurehead.
