REF: 081543 
 
Classified By: POL CHIEF GREGORY THOME FOR REASONS 1.4(B) AND (D) 
 
Â¶1. (C) In response to subject demarche, Hannele Voionmaa, MFA 
Counselor for peacekeeping and military crisis management 
operations, told PolChief that the GOF agreed June 8 to make 
a formal approach to Kyrgyz authorities regarding US access 
to Manas Airbase in Kyrgyzstan.  The GOF has a strong 
interest in ensuring that the US has appropriate and 
affordable access to Manas, Voionmaa said, given that such 
access has a direct impact on the success of Finland's own 
ISAF operations in Afghanistan.  Finland will instruct its 
regional Ambassador to demarche the Kyrgyz in the coming days.
