¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On September 2, during a late night speech to 
commemorate the 29th anniversary of the Nicaraguan Army, 
President Daniel Ortega declared that Nicaragua would back 
the Russian government of Vladimir Putin, and recognize the 
independence of Georgia's separatist enclaves of South 
Ossetia and Abkhazia.  He accused the U.S. and NATO of 
seeking to "encircle" the Russian Republic.  He also called 
Georgia's recent military action "pre-meditiated" and 
compared it to a Nazi blitzkreig.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) During a 45-minute, late night speech on September 2, 
marking the 29th Anniversary of Nicaragua's Army, Daniel 
Ortega announced that, "The Government of Nicaragua 
recognizes the independence of the Republics of South Ossetia 
and Abkhazia, and we are in full agreement with the 
Government of Russia,s position that the conflict can be 
ended through dialogue with European countries."  Ortega then 
launched into an attack against the U.S. and NATO, stating 
that, "the member countries of NATO are interested in closing 
a military circle around the Russian Republic," and that "the 
peace of the world has been threatened by the power-hungry, 
hegemonic politics that have arisen since the Soviet Union 
disappeared."  Ortega then asserted that NATO had "used 
Georgia in a military operation for a premeditated, 
lightning-fast attack typical of the kind launched by the 
Nazi army."  Finally, Ortega emphasized that Georgia's attack 
had left thousands dead and wounded, but this had not been 
reported by "the mass media dominated by global capitalism." 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT: According to international media reporting, 
Nicaragua is the first country, after Russia, to recognize 
the "independence" of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Ortega's 
action comes less than a week after we delivered the 
demarches on the Georgia-Russia conflict to the Foreign 
Ministry (REFS B & C) that had urged against such a step. 
Ortega's declaration is disappointing, but not unexpected, 
given the nostalgia for Cold War rhetoric and politics on his 
part.  This contrarian and unhelpful stance may also be a 
harbinger of what is in store from incoming UNGA 
president-elect and former Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel 
D'Escoto, who likely shares this world view and mindset.
