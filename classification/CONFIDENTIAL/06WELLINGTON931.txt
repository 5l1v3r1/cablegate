Classified By: DCM David J. Keegan. Reasons: E.O. 12958, 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action cable, see para 7. 
 
¶2. (C) Summary:  GNZ anticipates that Commodore Bainimarama 
will execute his plan to remove members of the government of 
Fiji on December 4 regardless of what he hears from foreign 
critics.  New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters will 
meet with Bainimarama on November 25.  While Peters will 
deliver strongly worded points (reftel), MFAT anticipates 
that Bainimarama will refuse to listen and that he will 
remain resolute in carrying out his plan.  GNZ will adjust 
what sanctions it will impose depending on how the coup 
unfolds, but anticipates strong sanctions even if there is an 
"administrative coup." MFAT sees that the situation in Tonga 
is stabilizing -- for the moment -- and continues to develop 
an assistance package and timetable for withdrawal of defense 
and police forces. 
 
Grim on what lies next in Fiji 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (C) Following a briefing on Fiji and Tonga to the 
diplomatic corps, Heather Riddell, Director, Pacific 
Division, New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(MFAT) offered a supplemental brief to Embassy Wellington 
officers.  On the subject of Fiji, MFAT has concluded that on 
December 4, Commodore Bainimarama will execute his plans for 
a coup, mindful of the fact that events may move more quickly 
if sedition charges are laid against Bainimarama.  MFAT is 
grappling with what technically would constitute a coup, but 
would view any change prompted by military pressure as at 
least an "administrative coup" -- with sanctions likely to 
come close those involving a full coup. 
 
¶4. (C) Tomorrow, November 25, New Zealand Foreign Minister is 
scheduled to meet Bainimarama one-on-one at his office, 
although MFAT doubts that the Commodore will be in a 
listening mode.  The GNZ assesses that Bainimarama is 
resolute on carrying out his plan.  MFAT anticipates 
providing Embassy Wellington with a download of the Peters 
meeting as soon as possible. 
 
¶5. (C) If a coup takes place, GNZ anticipates as one worst 
case scenario that New Zealand would receive a request from 
PM Qarase for joint Aussie-Kiwi military assistance.  "This 
is not a scenario we would relish," said Riddell, "as we 
would not necessarily prevail."  MFAT is mindful that its 
military is now spread thin, and Riddell said New Zealand 
would resist the call for assistance.  Another worst case 
scenario would see the Republic of Fiji Military Forces 
(RFMF) fragmenting and turning on itself, which could turn 
violent. 
 
But somewhat optimistic on Tonga 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) Following the King of Tonga's speech from the throne 
on November 23, in which he requested from Parliament a 
proposal on reform including a timetable, MFAT's view is that 
the situation in Tonga is stabilizing.  NZAID continues to 
develop a package of assistance.  GNZ is anticipating to 
withdrawal defense and police forces in the near term, but 
still does not have a timetable. Associate Minister for 
Pacific Island Affairs Winnie Laban indicated to DCM the 
evening before that she is not optimistic about Tonga, 
anticipating that it will be difficult to develop the kind of 
development program that will enable Tonga to become 
economically sustainable. 
 
Action Request: UN Resolution 
----------------------------- 
 
¶7. (C) MFAT understands that EAP/ANP Director Steve McGann 
and New Zealand Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Ian Hill have 
discussed a possible UN resolution.  MFAT would welcome more 
 
WELLINGTON 00000931  002 OF 002 
 
 
information about that discussion, and believes that a UN 
resolution would make it easier for the British to change 
their travel advisory for Fiji.
