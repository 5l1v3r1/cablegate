Classified By: CDA Rich Sanders for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1. (SBU) On August 14, U.S. citizen claimant Norman Senfeld 
signed a settlement document, or "finiquito," for the 
equivalent of $5 million to resolve his three property 
claims.  Mr. Senfeld will receive a payment of $2.5 million 
in the form of indemnification bonds (BPIs) at the end of 
August and the remaining $2.5 million in November 2009.  The 
GON deserves credit for sticking to its commitment to resolve 
this high-profile property case. 
 
GON RESOLVES SENFELD CASE 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On August 14, U.S. citizen Norman Senfeld, whose 
textile plant, subsidiaries, and equipment were expropriated 
by the GON in 1980, signed a "finiquito" to accept 
compensation of $5 million in the form of BPIs.  The GON 
provided the Property Office a copy of the finiquito on 
August 18.  Senfeld will receive two payments in the form of 
BPIs for his settlement.  He will receive the first payment 
at the end of August for the equivalent of $2.5 million and 
the remaining $2.5 million in November 2009.  Senfeld's case 
represents three property claims registered with the Embassy 
Property Office.

PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) In 1974, Senfeld created the Managua Textiles Company 
which subsequently became the Textiles of America Company 
(TEXAMSA) in 1979.  After TEXAMSA was expropriated by the GON 
in 1980, Senfeld pursued compensation for his property with 
the first Sandinista government without success.  In 1990, 
Senfeld filed claims with the GON and sought $6 million in 
compensation.  Since that time, Senfeld has patiently worked 
to negotiate a settlement with the government.  In May 2008, 
Senfeld reached an agreement in principle with the GON to 
settle his claims for the equivalent of $5 million.  Between 
May and August, Senfeld traveled several times to Nicaragua 
to finalize the agreement: He signed a letter of intent with 
the government in July.  During Senfeld's pursuit of 
compensation, his case received U.S. congressional attention 
which may have prompted the GON to finally settle his claims. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (C) The GON deserves credit for sticking to its commitment 
to resolve this high-profile case.  We had our doubts 
(reftel).  GON officials told us that President Ortega 
pressured Attorney General Hernan Estrada to resolve this 
case because he "never wanted to hear Senfeld's name again." 
End Comment.
