SUBJECT: TURKEY/GREECE/NATO: NOBLE ARCHER CANCELLATION AND 
STATUS OF AGIOS EFSTRATIOS 
 
REF: A. ATHENS 0459 
     ¶B. ATHENS 0550 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Nancy McEldowney for reasons 1.4 
 (b,d). 
 
¶1. (C)  We understand the commander of the NATO Air Component 
Command in Izmir cancelled NATO involvement in the February 
27 Noble Archer exercise in the Aegean after Greek 
authorities posted a NOTAM that included the island of 
Limnos, whose demilitarized status is in dispute.  MFA Deputy 
Director General for Aviation and Maritime Affairs Basat 
Ozturk, a NATO veteran who handles Aegean issues, told us 
March 15 that the MFA was taken by surprise by the Greek 
reaction to the cancellation and concerns over the island of 
Agios Efstratios. 
 
¶2. (C) He said the MFA had taken no position in the decision 
on the exercise, nor has it presented any new position on 
Aegean issues at NATO or elsewhere since then.  He attributed 
the exercise cancellation to poor communication between NATO 
components, from Brussels down to the CAOC level.  Ozturk 
said the Secretary General had queried Turkey's NATO permrep, 
who had merely advised that NATO should maintain its 
traditional neutral stance in Greece-Turkey disputes. 
 
¶3. (C) Ozturk said the MFA has been following the issue in 
the Greek press, since Greece has not approached Turkey 
through any official channels.  A senior Greek Embassy 
official had visited his department March 15 and had not 
mentioned the issue.  He said that numerous channels exist 
for the Greeks to express their concerns, including the 
scheduled March 22 Turkey-GreeQ Steering Group meeting at 
the political director level where Aegean confidence-building 
measures are on the agenda. 
 
¶4. (C) We recommend the Department refer specific queries 
about the cancellation of Noble Archer to NATO.  We should 
stick to our standing guidance on Greece-Turkey Aegean issues 
if asked about the status of Agios Efstratios.  Injecting 
ourselves into this latest dispute, merely a new variation on 
an old theme, runs the risk of appearing to undermine NATO 
decision-making and needlessly places the US squarely in the 
middle of the controversy.
