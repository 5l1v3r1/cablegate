SUBJECT: NICARAGUAN DEMOCRACY & INDIGENOUS WOMEN'S LEADER 
WOUNDED BY POLICE 
 
REF: MANAGUA 415 (MISKITO INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT) 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Robert J. Callahan for reasons 1.4 (b & d) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On June 9 in Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua's 
North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN), Miskito indigenous 
leader and democracy defender Marcela Davis was shot and 
wounded by Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) during a protest 
by Miskito lobster divers over falling lobster prices.  The 
subsequent police investigation has been fraught with 
irregularities.  Our contacts in the region, and Davis 
herself, believe that she was purposely targeted because of 
her opposition to the Sandinista National Liberation Front 
(FSLN) and the indigenous Yatama party (allied with the FSLN) 
as well as her support for the recent indigenous independence 
movement (see reftel).  We are unable to confirm the charge 
of an intended shooting, but it does not appear that the NNP 
is investigating the case with great enthusiasm.  END SUMMARY 
 
-------------------------------------- 
MARCELA DAVIS & FALLING LOBSTER PRICES 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) Marcela Davis, a 45-year old Afro-Miskito Nicaraguan, 
is the leader of a women's co-op that supports lobster divers 
in the RAAN.  She has also been a critical voice against the 
Yatama and FSLN political parties that control the region, 
and she supports the recent independence movement declared by 
the ad hoc Miskito Council of Elders (see reftel).  The 
world-wide economic crisis has dramatically reduced the 
demand and prices for Nicaragua's Caribbean lobsters.  Before 
the crisis, Miskito lobster divers could earn US$4.00 a pound 
for the lobsters they caught; in June employers were offering 
lobster divers between US$2.00 to $2.50 a pound.  The 
dramatic cut in prices was a huge hardship to this 
economically disadvantaged region and in particular to the 
lobster divers and the women,s co-op that supports them. 
 
------------------- 
DAY OF THE SHOOTING 
------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) On June 9, Hector Williams, the Wihta Tara (Miskito 
for "great judge") and leader of the independence movement, 
called on Miskito lobster divers to protest announced cuts to 
lobster prices.  Hundreds of Miskito lobster divers took over 
the main wharf in Puerto Cabezas (while unarmed NNP officers 
looked-on) after a two-hour meeting between the Wihta Tara 
and the Nicaragua Navy commander broke down.  The protestors 
occupied the wharf for a few hours, tipping over a couple of 
private vehicles before marching to the Central Park and then 
to the home of the largest lobster employer, Carlos Gaff. 
Davis, who participated in the march, said that when the 
protestors arrived near Mr. Gaff's home, a truck with 10 
armed NNP officers was already parked outside.  The 
protesters, upon seeing the armed police, stopped their march 
towards the Gaff home.  Davis said that after a few moments 
and without warning there were two shots fired into the air. 
Then a female NNP officer fired twice at Davis, who was near 
the front of the crowd.  The first shot entered below her 
right bicep, shattering the humerus bone, before exiting the 
back of her arm.  (NOTE: Davis,s doctors believe that it was 
divine providence that the bullet ricocheted off her bone, or 
it would have entered her chest and killed her.  END NOTE) In 
addition to Davis, two other protesters were wounded in the 
melee that followed. Four days of strikes and general unrest 
followed. 
 
--------------------- 
POLICE INVESTIGATION? 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) The police maintain that they did not shoot Davis, but 
rather someone in the crowd did.  However, the female NNP 
officer that allegedly shot Davis was immediately sent on 
vacation following the incident.  X-rays confirmed that a 
police bullet struck Davis' arm, mysteriously disappeared 
from the Puerto Cabezas hospital.  Within days of the 
shooting, Davis spoke with the women's police commissioner 
 
MANAGUA 00000845  002 OF 002 
 
 
about her case to no avail.  One month later she met with 
police sub-commissioner Emilio Roche (Badge #1033) about the 
status of the investigation.  Davis told us that during this 
meeting with the police "they tried to buy (her) off" with 
free food and asked her to "sign a document" that would 
release any liability on the police.  Davis refused to accept 
the bribe or sign any document.  She told us she has no hope 
of receiving justice in her case.  She also suffers great 
pain from her wound, is now out of work, and has no way to 
support her four children and elderly mother. 
 
¶5. (C) When we contacted the police station in Bilwi about 
the status of the police investigation, Commander Emilio 
Rodriguez was tight-lipped about it.  He told us that the 
investigation has been in the Public Defender,s office since 
a week following the incident.  However, he did not want to 
share any details about the case, specifically who the 
investigation was against.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6. (C) RAAN contacts believe that the initial shots by NNP 
officers were not provoked by the crowd; moreover, they tell 
us that it was no accident that Marcela Davis was 
specifically targeted from among a group of over 200-300 
protestors.  Our contacts believe that the FSLN purposely 
provoked the riot situation to use the Miskito diver protest 
as an opportunity to silence one of the region,s more vocal 
defenders of democracy and an outspoken critic of the 
Yatama-FSLN alliance.  Of course, these contacts are strongly 
opposed to the FSLN and their Yatama allies which may color 
their judgment.  Nonetheless, the possibility that Police 
intentionally fired upon an unarmed leader of an opposition 
group is extremely disturbing.  We will closely monitor the 
ongoing investigation, such as it is.
