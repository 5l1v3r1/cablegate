SUBJECT: PERU ON DEMONSTRATING PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR IRAQ 
REFERENDUM 
 
REF: STATE 189909 
 
Classified By: Deputy Polcouns Art Muirhead for Reason 1.4 (B, D) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Ambassador discussed this subject with Foreign 
Ministry Undersecretary for the Americas Pablo Portugal on 
10/14.  Portugal said the GOP would make a public statement 
of support for the constitutional process in Iraq at some 
point in the future.  Portugal had been briefed on the reftel 
talking points and fact sheets on the need to demonstrate 
international support for the referendum by North American 
Affairs Director Nestor Popolizio, who received this demarche 
from Deputy Polcouns on the same date. 
 
¶2. (C) Since Embassy had not seen a subsequent announcement 
regarding Iraq on the Foreign Ministry's web site, we 
followed up with Popolizio on 10/19.  Popolizio said that the 
Ministry still intended to issue a statement, but that this 
would be delayed a few days, due to media attention 
surrounding the assurances being sought from the Department 
by the Peruvian Embassy in Washington concerning the 
contracting by U.S. firms of Peruvian security personnel for 
assignments in Iraq.  We will continue to urge Ministry 
officials to issue the declaration they have committed to, 
and will forward the relevant text to the Department when it 
appears.
