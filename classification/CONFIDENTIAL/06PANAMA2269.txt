SUBJECT: ORTEGA WANTS TO SEND POSITIVE MESSAGE TO U.S., 
SAYS FM LEWIS 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR WILLIAM EATON FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega told Panamanian 
President Torrijos November 21 that he wants good relations 
with the United States.  His visit to Panama sends a signal 
that Nicaragua can be a positive player in the region, FM 
Samuel Lewis Navarro told the Ambassador the same day. 
Panama stands ready to be a moderating force and offer Ortega 
a counterweight to the influence of other leaders in the 
region, added Lewis.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MAKING AMENDS WITH THE U.S.? 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) In his two-hour meeting with President Torrijos, 
Ortega emphasized his desire to have good relations with the 
United States, said Lewis.  Ortega does not want to create 
divisions in the region and wants to send a pragmatic and 
reconciliatory message, he added.  For example, Ortega said 
he will not reject CAFTA, as he does not want to be a 
dividing force in the region.  However, signing on to CAFTA 
does not preclude Nicaragua's accession to other trade 
agreements, possibly with the EU or ALBA. 
 
NICARAGUA WANTS TO BE A REGIONAL PLAYER 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C) Ortega's choice of Panama as his first international 
visit since his election as president is significant, said 
Lewis, because some advisors had urged Ortega to visit 
Venezuela or Cuba as a first destination.  (Note: These 
"advisors" may be Venezuela and Cuba themselves.  End note.) 
That Ortega opted for Panama, as recommended by another set 
of advisors, shows moderation and that Central America is his 
priority, said Lewis. 
 
¶4.  (C) Panama wants to help Ortega play a moderate and 
conciliatory role in the region.  Panama will do whatever it 
can to create space for Ortega to maneuver in a constructive 
way through the region, said Lewis.  As part of such support, 
the GOP sent President Torrijos's presidential airplane to 
bring Ortega to Panama and take him to his next stops, 
Guatemala and El Salvador.  Lewis said Venezuela had offered 
Ortega an airplane, and Panama's counteroffer was partly to 
demonstrate that Nicaragua has other friends in the region. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5.  (C) Given the ruling PRD's (Revolutionary Democratic 
Party) historical relationship with Ortega and the 
Sandinistas, it is not surprising that the GOP is now 
reaching out to Nicaragua and helping to shore up its 
regional presence.  (Note: More on the Panama-Nicaragua link 
to be reported septel.  End note.)  Torrijos may also be 
seeking to keep the peace in the region, which is in Panama's 
interest, and to bolster Torrijos's leftist credentials.  END 
COMMENT.
