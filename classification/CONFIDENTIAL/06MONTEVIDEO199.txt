BOMBING 
 
REF: STATE 28802 
 
Classified By: Charge D'Affaires James D. Nealon 
for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
(C) PolCouns delivered reftel demarche to the MFA's Director 
of Multilateral Affairs Gustavo Alvarez on February 23 and 
raised the issue again with Director General for Political 
Affairs Bruno Faraone on February 24.  In response to the 
statement by President Bush and the joint statement by 
Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and General George Casey 
denouncing the destruction of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, 
Ambassador Faraone said that Uruguay condemned the 
Al-Askariya shrine's destruction in the strongest possible 
terms. While he did not explicitly commit to making a public 
statement denouncing the incident, he said that Uruguay would 
express its views. He especially stressed the need for Sunnis 
to seek restraint in order to avoid the obvious danger of 
civil war in Iraq.  He also opined that Al-Qaida was most 
obvious suspect in the bombing of the Shia's holy shrine.
