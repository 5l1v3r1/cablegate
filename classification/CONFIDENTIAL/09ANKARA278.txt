Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) Exercise "EGEMEN" is a Turkish national naval 
exercise in the Mediterranean, Aegean and Black Seas which 
currently calls for the participation of UK, US, Dutch and 
Belgian forces.  We understand that the UK is considering 
withdrawing their forces in response to Greek arguments. 
Since the U.S. vessel scheduled to participate in this 
exercise will be under British Tactical Control (TACON), we 
understand that NAVEUR may decide that it also withdraw, 
remaining under UK TACON.  At this stage, a decision to 
withdraw the U.S. asset will be taken by the Turks as a 
political decision.  Based on our recent other experiences 
with Aegean exercises, we believe that to pull our ship out 
based on Greek pressure, or in solidarity with the UK in 
backing down to Greek pressure, will do immense political 
harm to our relations with the Turks -- and here that could 
mean damage to our military cooperation.  We urge that this 
be fully considered in taking any decision on our ship.  The 
best solution, we believe, would be to convince the Brits not 
to withdraw at this late date.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) HM Ambassador to Turkey Nicholas Baird told 
Ambassador on February 20 that the UK was considering pulling 
out of Exercise EGEMEN 09, a Turkish national naval exercise 
scheduled to take place March 16 - 30.  Baird said that the 
decision would be taken in the coming days at the Ministerial 
level in London and would take into account both his own 
input and that of his colleague in Athens.  We asked whether 
the UK agreed with the Greek interpretation of the various 
issues-airspace, FIR, SAR responsibilities, etc.  Baird did 
not provide any indication that the UK was in agreement with 
the Greek arguments, but said rather that his understanding 
was that the UK would decide this more on political grounds, 
rather than on technical / legal grounds.   Baird also said 
that they would not want to take a decision "alone" but would 
rather do it in combination with the Dutch and US. 
 
¶3.  (C) Ambassador argued said that we had all taken a 
decision to participate.   If the UK were to take a decision 
to pull out of EGEMEN 09, but wanted it to be a joint 
decision, then we the US would be faced with a decision for 
which we would bear political cost but about which we had not 
been consulted.  Baird demurred a bit, then agreed, and said 
that there may or should be some "consultations." 
 
¶4.  (C) We understand that from a purely military standpoint 
we would want to pull our ship -- which will be TACON to the 
UK -- out of the exercise if the UK pulled out (ref).  But at 
this point, this strikes us as a political as well as a 
military decision.   This embassy did not push for US 
participation in the exercise -- which has been in planning 
since July 2008 -- but agreed to it after we ensured that the 
U.S. vessel and its aircraft would not be used or exploited 
in some way by the Turks to violate what the USG (not Greece) 
thought was Greek sovreignty.  All seemed on track until the 
Greeks started their diplomatic press. 
 
¶5.  (C) If Greece had presented a strong, legitimate 
complaint (our view is that they did not, but others might 
have had a different view), then the reasonable approach 
would have been to talk to the Turks about modifying some 
aspect of the exercise to make it comply with what the rest 
of world, not necessarily Athens, thinks about these issues. 
 
¶6.  (C) But to pull our ship out based on Greek pressure, or 
in solidarity with the UK in backing down to Greek pressure, 
will do immense political harm, and here that could include 
military cooperation damage, to our relations with the Turks. 
 We understand the "TACON" issue, but there is now way we can 
sell that as a rationale for the pullout.  I urge that this 
be fully considered in the taking of any decision at this 
point on our ship. We believe the best course of action at 
this point is to persuade the Brits not to pull out.
