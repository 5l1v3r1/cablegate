SUBJECT: MILITARY-CIVIL POLICE CLASH OUTSIDE SAO PAULO 
GOVERNOR'S PALACE 
 
Classified By: Consul General Thomas White; Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: Striking members of the Civil Police clashed 
with on-duty Military Police in a confrontation that left 25 
persons wounded near the Sao Paulo Governor Serra's Palace on 
10/16. The confrontation, which generated some lurid TV and 
press images, reflects Civil Police frustration with Serra, 
for not meeting their demands.  The participation of 
left-wing and union elements in the demonstration also 
suggests that Serra opponents may have sought to provoke an 
incident that would call into question Serra's leadership. 
Right now, the ruling Workers Party (PT) candidate for Sao 
Paulo Mayor, Marta Suplicy, is sinking in the polls relative 
to her rival -- and strong Serra ally -- incumbent Mayor 
Gilberto Kassab.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Striking members of the Civil Police clashed with 
on-duty Military Police in a confrontation that left 25 
persons wounded near the Sao Paulo Governor's Palace on 
10/16.  A Military Police Colonel was among those wounded. 
The clash took place when a group of Civil Police 
demonstrators, who have been on strike for a month asking for 
a 15 percent raise, marched on the Governor's Palace and 
demanded to be received.  When they did not get their wishes, 
they broke through one police line and tried to force their 
way toward the Palace.  On-duty Military Police retaliated 
with rubber bullets and tear gas.  In response, some Civil 
Police brandished arms.  After a tense period of 
confrontation, the protesters dispersed.  The incident 
produced lurid TV images of a "shoot-out" between the two 
groups, one that involved mostly tear gas and rubber bullets. 
 
Rival Organizations 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Both the Civil Police and the Military Police work 
for the State of Sao Paulo.  The Military Police were created 
by the GOB during the period of military rule (1964-1980) and 
the two organizations have a sometimes testy relationship  In 
general, the Military Police are better armed and have more 
authority than their Civil Police counterparts. 
 
Other Actors 
 
¶4.  (U) An additional complicating factor was the presence of 
members of various unions, Forca Sindical and the Unified 
Workers Central (CUT) as well as several left wing 
polticians, in the Civil Police demonstration.  Though the 
Civil Police have their own union, these other organizations 
participated in solidarity.  Later in the day, Governor Serra 
accused the Workers Party (PT) and the unions of trying to 
stir up trouble to influence the mayoral election. 
 
Comment: It's Probably Politics 
 
¶5.  (C) The Civil Police effort to get their salary raised is 
a longstanding one as is their rivalry with the Military 
Police.  Nonetheless, this latest incident would appear tied 
to politics.  While the Civil Police are frustrated that 
Serra will not meet with them, at the same time, the PT 
candidate for Mayor of Sao Paulo, Marta Suplicy, trails 
incumbent DEM Party Mayor Kassab by 15 points in a 10/15 poll 
by IBOPE.  Kassab is a strong ally of PSDB Governor and 
likely Presidential candidate Jose Serra, and the Sao Paulo 
Mayor's race is widely viewed as a prequel for the 2010 
presidential election.  Consequently, the demonstrators' 
confrontation with Serra served both the police strikers and 
the PT in this pre-election environment, raising the pressure 
on Serra to answer the Civil Police demands and creating an 
incident that could be used to question the Governor's 
leadership.
