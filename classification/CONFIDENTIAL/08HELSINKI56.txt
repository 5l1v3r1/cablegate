SUBJECT: FINLAND: INVITING COUNTRIES TO KOSOVO STEERING 
GROUP 
 
REF: STATE 12026 
 
Classified By: Pol Chief Greg Thome for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Finland has signaled its intention to move 
very quickly to offer bilateral recognition to an independent 
Kosovo.  Although the GoF strongly supports a "common EU 
platform" in favor of recognition, it recognizes that some 
member states' opposition makes this unlikely.  Finland is 
eager to participate in the Kosovo International Steering 
Group (ISG).  During his Feb. 5-6 trip to Belgrade and 
Pristina, FM and OSCE CiO Kanerva encountered anger and 
bitterness, even from President Tadic; the Serbs were willing 
to discuss some OSCE-related issues but roundly rejected even 
Kanerva's effort to raise EU initiatives, calling the Union 
"deceitful."  In Pristina, Kanerva told PM Thaci, "Your work 
is now only beginning -- don,t expect independence to 
produce miracles."  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) PolChief delivered reftel demarche to Finnish MFA 
Office Director for the Western Balkans Juha Ottman Feb. 8. 
Ottman also offered a read-out on Foreign Minister and 
current OSCE Chairman in Office (CiO) Ilkka Kanerva,s Feb. 
5-6 trip to Serbia and Kosovo. 
 
GOF TO RECOGNIZE KOSOVO; EAGER TO PLAY A ROLE IN ISG 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
¶3. (SBU) Ottman confirmed what Kanerva had signaled to the 
press earlier this week and what we had reported previously 
(reftels): i.e., that Finland will move rapidly to recognize 
an independent Kosovo, joining the US and some EU member 
states in the "first wave" of countries to do so.  Finland 
will also strongly support a "common platform" for EU 
recognition, even though some member states, strong 
objections will likely prevent the platform from emerging. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Ottman also informed us that the GoF would be very 
pleased to join an International Steering Group (ISG) that 
would support Kosovo's development as an independent state. 
Promoting peace and stability in Kosovo has been a top GoF 
foreign policy priority since 1999, Ottman reminded, and 
Finland is already moving forward with a new package of 
security and development assistance.  Finland will increase 
its peacekeeping presence from 400 to 450 troops and will 
resume a "framework nation" role within NATO/KFOR this 
spring.  The GoF has approved sending 80 experts to Kosovo as 
part of the EU Rule of Law mission, and has authorized $15 
million in development assistance over the next three years. 
Given this long-term commitment, the offer of a position on 
the ISG is very welcome, Ottman said. 
 
ICY RECEPTION IN BELGRADE 
------------------------- 
¶4. (C) Regarding Kanerva,s Feb. 5-6 visit to the region, the 
"tone in Serbia was remarkably negative," Ottman noted.  The 
Serbs were incensed that the EU had announced publicly the 
approval of its Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo, a move that 
Prime Minister Kostunica told Kanerva was "deceitful." 
Belgrade remains adamantly opposed to the Ahtisaari Plan, and 
Kostunica condemned the EU Mission as "de facto 
implementation of Ahtisaari -- which we cannot accept."  Even 
President Tadic angrily criticized the timing of the EU 
announcement, Ottman reported.  Tadic told Kanerva that he 
firmly believes in promoting the European perspective for his 
country, but that as president he is also bound to "defend" 
Serbia's territorial integrity.  Beyond these conversations, 
Kanerva,s efforts to raise other EU-related issues were 
rejected, with FM Jeremic canceling a lunch in which he and 
Kanerva were to discuss Serbia,s Stabilization and 
Association Agreement (SAA). 
 
KOSOVO: "YOUR WORK IS ONLY BEGINNING" 
------------------------------------- 
¶5. (C) In Pristina, PM Thaci signaled that Kosovo would 
declare independence "any day," but he assured Kanerva that 
his government would coordinate the announcement well in 
advance with EU and NATO partners.  Thaci and other leaders 
eagerly argued that Kosovo is ready for independence; Kanerva 
agreed, but told them, "Your work is now only beginning," 
especially in terms of developing the economy and ensuring 
the rule of law.  "Don't expect independence to produce 
miracles."  Kanerva urged the Kosovars to press for extending 
the OSCE Mission in Kosovo (OMIK).  Thaci agreed that this is 
important, although he reportedly complained about the need 
for the OSCE to provide more support for Kosovar institutions 
-- and about the activities of OSCE Rep Guildiman.  Kanerva 
acknowledged that there had been some problems and that as 
CiO he would seek to address them, but he also urged Thaci to 
maintain a supportive relationship with OMIK. 
 
¶6. (C) NOTE: Ottman added as an aside that Moscow is all but 
certain to prevent OMIK's mandate from being renewed if 
Pristina declares independence.  However, the Finns are now 
picking up signals that Moscow might subsequently allow a 
smaller OSCE mission to be reconstituted, perhaps in three or 
four months.  While the Russians want to make a big show of 
their unhappiness over an independence declaration, they are 
also coming to realize that with no OSCE presence on the 
ground in Kosovo, Russia will also have no presence, Ottman 
opined.  Kanerva is convinced that a 200-person mission would 
be affordable from a financial perspective and could provide 
a sufficient complement to the EU mission, once it stands up, 
Ottman added.  END NOTE.
