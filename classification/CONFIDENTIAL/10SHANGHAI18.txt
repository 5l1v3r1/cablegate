¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The Copenhagen climate change conference
exemplified a competition in the "game of global governance,"
with Europe´s influence waning, and new dynamic between the
developing countries (led by China), Europe and other developed
countries, and the United States emerging; according to a senior
researcher at a highly respected and influential Shanghai-based
think-tank. While China´s position had been clear going into
the negotiations, others tried to deviate from the established
multilateral accords and drive a wedge between large and small
developing countries. The behavior of China´s delegation at
Copenhagen reflects not only a lack of coordination between the
Foreign Ministry and National Development and Reform Commission,
but also that China´s internal decision-making process does not
mesh with the fast-moving negotiating environment that
characterized the Copenhagen discussions. END SUMMARY.

CHINA´S ROLE "POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE"
----------------------------------------

¶2. (SBU) In a January 6 meeting with Embassy Beijing
Environment, Science, Technology, and Health Counselor Brent
Christensen, [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN] explained that the recent Copenhagen
climate change conference (UNFCCC COP 15) was an international
platform where China, in contrast to the discussions surrounding
the global financial crisis, was at center stage, as the largest
developing economy and the largest emitter of greenhouse gases
(GHGs). Despite this unaccustomed position, [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN] stressed that,
going into the negotiations, China totally understood its role
and obligations. Premier Wen Jiabao had outlined a position
consistent with the outcomes of previous negotiations and the
framework established by the previous UN-sponsored conferences
since 1992.

¶3. (SBU) Based on the legacy of those agreements, [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN] asserted
that China has played a positive and constructive role in the
climate negotiations by maintaining cohesion among developing
countries. China worked hard to bring about a consensus among
developing countries, [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN] stated. He was optimistic that the
agreement reached in Copenhagen, along with the previous texts,
will serve as the "groundwork" for future negotiations, even
though the Copenhagen agreement has "fallen short" of
expectations.

COPENHAGEN: STRUGGLE OVER ROLES IN "GLOBAL GOVERNANCE"
--------------------------------------------- ---------

¶4. (SBU) [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN] characterized the Copenhagen negotiations as a
competition over roles in the emerging game of global
governance. For the first time, he observed, European nations
felt they might lose their "traditional supremacy." As an
example, European nations were "furious" and humiliated over how
President Obama had brokered a deal with the "BASIC" countries
(Brazil, South Africa, India, and China) on the document which
emerged from the Copenhagen conference. In [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN]s view, the
Copenhagen discussions had revealed a new three-way division
within the international community on climate change. Instead
of the traditional developed/developing country divide, the
players were split among a bloc of developed countries led by
the European Union, a developing country bloc including the
Group of 77 (G-77) states and China, and -- by itself -- the
United States.

¶5. (SBU) The Chinese position, [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN] emphasized, is that all
countries have common but differentiated responsibilities to
address climate change. Developed countries need to make
"reparations" for their longstanding contribution to the problem
SHANGHAI 00000018 002.2 OF 003
through legally binding obligations to reduce GHGs as well as to
provide technology transfer and financial support to developing
countries. [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN] said that, prior to the Copenhagen
negotiations, China had clearly stated its bottom line of
reducing carbon intensity by 40-45 percent, so it had nothing to
conceal. China´s only concession during the talks was more
cooperation with international organizations on verification of
compliance on reduction commitments. The Europeans, however,
"played a lot of tricks" and took advantage of their "united
front" to endeavor to push China to increase its carbon
intensity reductions to an unacceptable level of 60 percent.
[TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN] said Premier Wen was quite angry that UK Prime Minister
Brown had simply repeated European earlier demands on the 60
percent target.

CHINA OPPOSES DEVELOPED COUNTRY "WEDGE TACTICS"
--------------------------------------------- --

¶6. (SBU) According to [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN], Europe and, to a certain extent,
the developed countries as a whole had tried to create "a new
track" and deviate from the consensus established at previous UN
climate change conferences. This effort included not just the
proposal by the Danish conference chair, but also a larger
undercurrent primarily among the Europeans advocating new
legally binding commitments. The strategy of this group, [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN]
asserted, was to drive a wedge in the developing country bloc
between small states that are extremely vulnerable to climate
change and the large developing countries. For example, [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN]
said the small island states began to believe that if the BASIC
countries continued to "refuse" the offer from the Europeans and
developed countries, it would inevitably harm the island states´
interests. To help reassure other developing countries, China
promised not to avail itself of any of the funding promised by
the developed countries.

¶7. (SBU) Although [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN] acknowledged that the UN consensus-based
approach was not efficient in reaching an overall agreement, he
said that the key was not the process itself but rather whether
the developed world as a whole would fulfill its existing
commitments to the UN climate change process and the roadmap
that has been laid out since the early 1990s. Europe and others
tried to deviate from the previous consensus that made the
prospects for progress at Copenhagen much worse. The process is
one thing, but it is clear that core members must have a
dialogue and framework before the formal negotiations. [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN] was
not clear on the most efficient makeup of a core group, but
stressed that overcoming the gap in understanding between the
developed and developing countries was essential.

LACK OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS EXPERTS HURT CHINESE DELEGATION
--------------------------------------------- ----------
¶8. (C) In response to reports that there was "tension" between
the National Reform and Development Commission (NDRC) and
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) over the climate change
negotiations, [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN] said it was a coordination problem between
the two agencies, not tension. On climate policy, NDRC has the
expertise and clear lead; however, MFA is the international
affairs lead with the expertise in diplomacy. While NDRC´s
climate lead Xie Zhenhua might have been clear in articulating
China´s climate policy, he was not an expert in UN process or
international negotiations. From the beginning, MFA should have
sent higher level officials to join Xie´s climate group in the
run-up to Copenhagen, said [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN]. He indicated that even Premier
Wen Jiabao had not been fully empowered to strike a deal at
Copenhagen on his own but would have had to consult with other
(unspecified) members of the Chinese leadership.

C0MMENT - CHINESE NOT EQUIPPED TO BARGAIN
-----------------------------------------

¶9. (C) [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN], who followed multilateral issues closely [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN], knows well
Beijing´s internal dynamic with respect to negotiations like
those in Copenhagen. His comments suggest that the Chinese
Government is institutionally ill-equipped to participate in the
fast-moving, disorganized negotiating environment that
characterized the Copenhagen discussions. Despite this, his
observation that China´s bottom line was clear well before the
talks began indicates that a strong consensus had been
established within China´s leadership and bureaucracy that was
difficult to change once the talks began.
¶10. (U) This report has been cleared by Embassy Beijing.
