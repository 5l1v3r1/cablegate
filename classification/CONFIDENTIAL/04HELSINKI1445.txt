¶1. (C) POL Chief delivered reftel demarche November 10 to 
Elina Kalkku, Director of the Finnish MFA's Security Policy 
Unit.  Drawing on reftel talking points, he noted that 
deployment of a Georgian battalion to Iraq for "middle ring" 
security is imminent, with a Romanian unit likely to follow 
soon after, but that both deployments are contingent upon the 
salary support promised by Finland and other EU states.  POL 
Chief said that the UN Comptroller and Legal Advisor 
apparently are opposed to establishing a UN trust fund to 
disburse these funds, and urged that the GoF consider 
disbursing the funds bilaterally, or via a multilateral 
account set up by the EC or a donor country. 
 
¶2. (C) Kalkku said that according to her understanding, the 
possibility of a UN trust fund was still a live issue.  The 
Finnish mission to the United Nations has reported that the 
Asia division of the Secretariat strongly supports the 
creation of such a fund, and therefore a split-recommendation 
memo was likely to go forward to the UNSYG for his decision. 
 
¶3. (C) Kalkku -- stressing that this was a preliminary 
reaction -- said that if the SYG decided against a UN trust 
fund, the Finns probably could not disburse the money 
bilaterally in the current calendar year, because it has been 
obligated under the GoF budget chapter for multilateral 
assistance.  In calendar year 2005, it might be possible to 
reprogram the money to a bilateral chapter -- but the Finns 
would much prefer a multilateral fund, rather than having to 
set up and operate a fund on a national basis.  POL Chief 
recommended that the GoF make clear in New York their 
preference for a UN trust fund. 
 
¶4. (C) Kalkku asked whether the Georgian deployment is likely 
to take place before the end of the year.  Embassy would 
appreciate Department's assistance in answering this question.
