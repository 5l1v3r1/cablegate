SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND'S POSITION ON TRIPS-CBD ISSUE 
 
REF: STATE 218119 
 
¶1. (U) New Zealand will support the U.S. government's 
position in Hong Kong to block any attempt to include a 
negotiating mandate on the relationship between the TRIPS 
Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 
the ministerial declaration. 
 
¶2. (U) Post delivered reftel talking points December 6 to 
Reuben Levermore in the Trade Negotiations Division of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Levermore reported 
December 8 that the points mirrored New Zealand's position. 
The New Zealand government sees ongoing discussions as 
necessary for identifying and addressing issues related to 
the TRIPS-CBD relationship.  It does not view negotiations as 
appropriate. 
 
¶3. (C) The New Zealand government also is wary of the 
possibility that the EC may attempt to link this issue with 
an effort to extend protection of geographical indications, 
which fall in the same consultations as the TRIPS-CBD issue.
