REF: STATE 4313 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Counselor David E. Henifin for reason 1.4 (d). 
 
(S) On January 26, we notified Carlos Cordero of the MFA's 
Department of Disarmament, Terrorism and Organized Crime of 
USG plans to submit the names of four individuals (listed 
reftel) to the UNSC 1267 Sanctions Committee for inclusion on 
its consolidated list of individuals subject to UNSC-mandated 
sanctions (reftel).  Cordero appreciated the pre-notification 
but offered no substantive response.  Cordero explained, per 
GOCR established procedures regarding UNSC designations, that 
the MFA would notify Costa Rica's banking oversight agencies, 
Costa Rica's intelligence service (DIS), and coordinate with 
Interpol.
