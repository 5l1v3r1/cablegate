SUBJECT: GON NON-COOPERATION ON FARC ARMS SMUGGLING CASE
 
REF: MANAGUA 868 (NOTAL) 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Robert Callahan, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (S) SUMMARY. In a series of communications and meetings 
between June 17 and June 19, various senior-level officials 
of the Government of Nicaragua (GON) refused to cooperate 
with a routine USG request for the transfer of evidence 
pertinent to an on-going Department of Justice (DOJ) 
investigation related to arms-smuggling by the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  The refusal to cooperate by 
senior GON cabinet members is of concern given that the 
evidence in question was seized during operations that were 
initiated based on USG-obtained information and that were 
partially funded by the USG. The evidence request was for 
samples of high-power rifles seized in two operations carried 
out in Nicaragua. Because the USG and the GON do not have a 
bilateral Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), previous 
evidence transfers involved the physical evidence being 
passed directly between law-enforcement representatives of 
the two nations.  The GON's sudden refusal to cooperate on 
such a routine transfer could be a troubling harbinger of 
future difficulties in Post's counter narcotics cooperation 
with the GON.  END SUMMARY.

Developing The Case

¶2. (S) In late 2007, the DOJ started an investigation of 
narcotics and arms smuggling networks operating in Colombia, 
Panama, Nicaragua, and Honduras.  DOJ investigators quickly 
discovered that buyers and suppliers of arms often met in 
Miami to set up their deals.  The investigators soon zeroed 
in on one group in Nicaragua, headed by Nicaraguan national 
Jimmy Martinez.  This group seemed to have access to large 
quantities -- possibly metric tons -- of small arms. 
Utilizing this information, a DOJ undercover agent contacted 
Martinez claiming to be an arms buyer/drug supplier from the 
FARC and offered a drugs-for-arms deal.  Martinez quickly 
agreed to the deal, and detailed negotiations began over how 
many rifles would be exchanged and for what quantity of 
narcotics. 
 
¶3. (S) In October 2008, the Nicaraguan Navy seized 158 rifles 
off of the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua. The seizure was 
widely covered in Nicaraguan media. After the seizure, 
Martinez contacted the DOJ undercover agent and claimed that 
the seized rifles were part of an arms shipment he had 
prepared as part of the supposed FARC deal. In April 2009, 
the Nicaraguan Navy seized approximately 50 additional 
rifles.  As had happened months before, Martinez again called 
the DOJ undercover agent to inform that the seized rifles 
also had been part of his stock.  (NOTE:  Photos of 
Martinez's arms stocks obtained by DOJ were compared with 
details about the storage and protection of the weapons 
seized by the Navy and support Martinez's claim that the 
weapons came from his supply.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶4. (S) When asked whether he could provide "heavier" weapons 
such as TOW missiles, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) or 
RPG-7s, Martinez confirmed he could.  He implied; however, 
that obtaining such weapons would require working with yet 
another supplier.  (NOTE:  DOJ sources believe that Martinez 
may be working with "The Buddha," a known, notorious arms 
trafficker operating along the Nicaraguan-Honduran border. 
END NOTE.)  According to DOJ investigators, Martinez has 
close ties to Steadman Fagoth, an indigenous Resistance 
fighter from the 1980s, now aligned with Daniel Ortega's 
ruling Sandinista (FSLN) Party. Fagoth is the President of 
the Nicaragua Fisheries Agency (INPESCA).

¶5. (S) Following the two weapons seizures, the DEA Country 
Office made the request for evidence transfer.  As had 
normally happened in the past, senior Nicaraguan National 
Police (NNP) officials agreed to the transfer request, and 
DEA began making arrangements for a special flight to pick-up 
the weapon samples in early June 2009.  However, when 
U.S.-based law enforcement officials arrived in Nicaragua, 
NNP counterparts informed the DEA Country Director that the 
request for weapons samples would only be executed with 
direct approval from Nicaraguan Attorney General Hernan 
Estrada.  DEA prepared a letter to Estrada requesting the 
evidence transfer.  Subsequently, Estrada informed the 
Embassy that he could only act upon a request made via the 
Ministry of Foreign Relations (MINREX). 
 
¶6.  (S) Upon learning of Estrada's conditions, on June 17, 
the Ambassador called Foreign Minister Samuel Santos in an 
effort to expedite a solution.  During that telcon, Santos 
declined to cooperate, arguing that the U.S. request was not 
based upon any existing international or bilateral agreement, 
and that the issue was the Attorney General's to resolve. 
The Ambassador then phoned Estrada and asked whether a 
Diplomatic Note to MINREX requesting the evidence would meet 
Estrada's needs.  He indicated that it would.  The Ambassador 
then phoned Santos a second time to explain the arrangement 
reached with Estrada and that a note would be sent to the 
Ministry.   Later that day, the Political Counselor 
hand-delivered to MINREX, Diplomatic Note 2009-069 (dated 17 
June 2009), which formally requested cooperation on the case. 
 
¶7. (S) The following day, on June 18 DEA representatives 
received an e-mail from the NNP stating that Attorney General 
Estrada had, in fact, now agreed to the evidence transfer. 
However, when U.S. law enforcement personnel arrived at the 
transfer site the NNP once again refused to cooperate, and 
that only a letter from FM Santos authorizing the transfer 
would suffice.  Despite Embassy officials' efforts to contact 
Santos yet again, he proved "unavailable."  After 
several-hours delay, aircraft scheduling issues prevented a 
further extension and U.S. law enforcement personnel were 
forced to return without the evidence.

¶8. (S) COMMENT:  During a recent meeting with MINREX on a 
separate evidence transfer request (to be reported SEPTEL) we 
raised this case.  Our Ministry interlocutors were aware of 
it, but indicated that the Minister had been "unable to 
comply with his verbal commitments" to the Ambassador due to 
unidentified "external factors."  We believe this incident 
raises serious concerns about the GON's level of commitment 
and continued willingness to cooperate on law enforcement 
issues outside the realm of direct drug seizure operations 
that have characterized our bilateral cooperation for the 
last several years.  Drug seizures are important, but are of 
limited long-term utility if not translated into prosecutions 
and convictions of traffickers.  We note that direct 
transfers of evidence between law enforcement entities are 
routine occurrences, even in countries where the U.S. does 
not have a formal MLAT arrangement.  In fact, such transfers 
with Nicaragua have taken place before without incident or 
complication.  Given this history, we find it highly unusual 
that the GON elevated this case to the ministerial level, and 
was still unwilling or unable to bring it to resolution. 
Furthermore, the GON's reticence to accept the universal 
principle of "comity among nations" may indicate a troubling 
new departure for this administration.
