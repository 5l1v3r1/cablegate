 (B) AND (D) 
 
 ¶1. (S) Econoff delivered reftel demarche and non-paper July 
7 to Martin Briens, Office Director for Disarmament and 
Nuclear Nonproliferation at the MFA.  Briens was highly 
supportive of the U.S. approach, noting that France had been 
behind the original listing of the two Iranian companies in 
UNSCR 1803, and had supplied a good deal of information on 
suspect shipments to third countries as well.  The U.S. 
non-paper was "useful" in that it complemented what France 
already knew. Briens also noted that discussions were 
underway within the EU to strengthen controls over these two 
companies in the context of transposition into EU law of 
UNSCR 1803. France would have preferred an outright ban on 
these companies, but this was unacceptable to its EU 
partners. Further details on the measures France is proposing 
to reinforce UNSCR 1803 will be reported septel. 
 
¶2. (S) France's draft common position would require mandatory 
declarations by port authorities of the arrival or departure 
of any Iran Air plane or IRISL vessel, and the contents of 
their cargo.  Member states would not be obliged to search 
the cargo absent reasonable grounds as required by UNSCR 
1803, but France also wanted to see a provision for random 
inspection included.  Briens said that of the major EU 
shippers concerned, Denmark was highly supportive of the 
approach, but Cyprus, Malta and to a lesser extent Greece 
were not. It was important to reach out to all of the latter 
three countries to sensitize them to the dangers involved. 
Briens said he would circulate the non-paper to Customs, 
Finance, and other concerned agencies within the GOF.
