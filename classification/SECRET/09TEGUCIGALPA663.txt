  ¶1. (S) President Arias called the Ambassador the evening 
of July 27 to get an update on the situation in Honduras 
and our efforts to support his mediation efforts.  The 
Ambassador responded that the situation was mixed.  On the 
positive side, the Honduran military was now moving in the 
direction of supporting Arias' mediation effort and a 
settlement along the lines of his most recent 12-point 
proposal.  The Ambassador noted that the Honduran military's 
issuance of a statement on July 25 supportive of a 
negotiated settlement was a strong step forward.  The 
Ambassador added that through persistent U.S. efforts here in 
Tegucigalpa and in Washington many Hondurans in the 
political, business, and civil society communities were 
now supportive of a democratic solution as offered by Arias' 
mediation.  The Ambassador stressed that we continued to 
pause in our economic assistance, had completely suspended 
our military aid, and were moving to put direct pressure on 
regime officials by withdrawing their diplomatic visas.  The 
Ambassador noted that the recent visit of a congressional 
delegation led by Congressman Connie Mack, in which the CODEL 
had met in a very high-profile manner with de facto regime 
President Roberto Micheletti, had not been helpful to our 
efforts to find a democratic and constitutional solution to 
the crisis, since it gave the Micheletti the hope to hang 
tough and not negotiate on the issue of the quick return of 
President Zelaya. 
 
¶2. (S) Arias agreed with the Ambassador's assessment.  He 
added that President Zelaya's continued antics on the 
border were also not helpful.  Arias made clear that he 
opposed Zelaya's lingering presence on the border and his 
threats to return with supporters back to Honduras.  Both 
agreed that the practical reaction to Zelaya's threats on 
the border was a hardening of the regime's position, making 
an agreement more difficult.  Arias and the Ambassador also 
agreed that Zelaya was increasingly isolated and being 
influenced in a radical direction by Venezuela and 
Nicaragua.  The Ambassador told Arias that Zelaya advisor 
Rixi Moncada had mentioned yesterday that there was a 
chance that President Zelaya would attend the Tuxtla Summit 
on Wednesday.  Arias responded that he and his government had 
not been informed of Zelaya's planned participation in the 
Summit, although he agreed it would be a very wise decision 
if he chose to travel to Costa Rica.  Both agreed that 
Zelaya should consider traveling to Washington for 
consultations 
with the U.S. Administration and the OAS, and possibly travel 
to other capitals including Mexico. 
 
¶3. (S) Arias mentioned that the Honduran Congress's 
consideration of the Arias proposal, particularly the 
political amnesty aspects of the deal, were extremely 
important.  The Ambassador briefed Arias on the 
congressional deliberations begun on July 27, which 
included the creation of congressional commissions to study 
the different aspects of the proposed agreement.  The 
Ambassador said that the embassy would make a major push 
this week to influence Congress to throw their support 
behind Arias' mediation.  They agreed to stay in touch.
