Classified By: ISN/MTR DIRECTOR PAM DURHAM, REASON: 1.4 (C).

¶1. (U) This is an action request. Embassy Seoul, please see paragraph 3.

¶2. (S) Background/Objective: The United States has information that in December 2009, an Iranian company was seeking to procure five tons of carbon fiber from Yoon Networks Shanghai Company, a China-based firm operated by a South Korean individual. We understand this company is likely seeking this material on behalf of the Shahid Bakeri Industries Group (SBIG), which is responsible for Irans solid propellant ballistic missile program and an entity designated under United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737. The fiber being sought by the Iranian company may be controlled by the Wassenaar Arrangement and Nuclear Suppliers Group and could be used to produce rocket nozzles or motor cases for Irans solid propellant ballistic missile systems. Given our close relationship with South Korea on nonproliferation issues, we want make ROK officials aware of this information to support their export control efforts. We also want to ask them to investigate this activity and use all measures available to p revent this South Korean-owned company from acting as a source of supply to Irans missile program.

¶3. (S) Action Request: Request Embassy Seoul approach appropriate host government officials to deliver talking points/non-paper in paragraph 4 below and report response. Talking points also may be provided as a non-paper.

¶4. (S) Begin talking points/non-paper:

(SECRET//REL SOUTH KOREA)

--We would like to alert you to information of proliferation concern and request your assistance in investigating this activity.

--The United States has information that in December 2009, an Iranian company was seeking to procure five tons of carbon fiber from Yoon Networks Shanghai Company, a China-based firm operated by a South Korean individual.

--We understand this company is likely seeking this material on behalf of the Shahid Bakeri Industries Group (SBIG), which is responsible for Irans solid propellant ballistic missile program and an entity designated under United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737.

--The fiber being sought by the Iranian company may be controlled by the Wassenaar Arrangement and Nuclear Suppliers Group and could be used by Iran to produce rocket nozzles for its solid propellant medium-range and short-range ballistic missile systems. It also could be used by SBIG to produce lighter motor cases that could potentially extend the range of these systems.

--We believe that the transfer of this material to SBIG poses a significant missile proliferation risk and is inconsistent with UNSCR 1737.

--We hope this information is useful in supporting your export control efforts. We also ask that you investigate this activity and use all measures available to prevent this firm from acting as a source of supply for missile-related entities in Iran.

--We look forward to continued cooperation on missile nonproliferation issues and to hearing of any actions your government takes in response to this information.
