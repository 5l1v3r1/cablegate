THIS IS AN ADDENDUM TO BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION PROVIDED REFTEL. 
 
¶1. (S) INR/B BIO FROM 1998 REPORTS THAT HOR NAMHONG'S 
COLLEAGUES RESENT HIM FOR APPOINTING HIS RELATIVES TO KEY 
MINISTRY POSITIONS.  IN 1992, INR/B DESCRIBED HIM AS AN 
OPPORTUNIST WHO LACKED HIS OWN POWER BASES, BUT GAINED 
POSITIONS BY SEEKING ALLIANCES AND DOING FAVORS FOR POWERFUL 
SOC LEADERS. 
 
¶2. (S) AN UNDATED, UNATTRIBUTED REPORT ON FILE AT THE EMBASSY 
CLAIMS THAT: HOR NAMHONG CAME BACK TO CAMBODIA AFTER THE 
KHMER ROUGE TOOK OVER, BUT WAS NOT KILLED BECAUSE HE WAS A 
SCHOOLMATE OF IENG SARY.  HE BECAME HEAD OF THE BENG TRABEK 
CAMP AND HE AND HIS WIFE COLLABORATED IN THE KILLING OF MANY 
PRISONERS.  AMONG THE VICTIMS WERE THE QUEEN'S SISTER NANETTE 
AND HER HUSBAND METEVI (A RELATIVE OF SIRIK MATAK).  HOR 
NAMHONG ALMOST KILLED CHEM SNGUON AND HIS FAMILY (INCLUDING 
CHEM WIDHYA WHO WAS WITH HIS FATHER IN THE CAMP) BECAUSE 
SOMEONE HEARD WIDHYA LISTENING TO A FRENCH RADIO BROADCAST. 
THE VIETNAMESE INVADED JUST BEFORE THE CHEM FAMILY WAS TO BE 
KILLED.  HOR NAMHONG'S WIFE ASKED IENG SAR TO HELP THEIR 
DAUGHTER WORK WITH THE KHMER ROUGE REGIME.  SHE POINTED OUT 
THAT SHE HELPED IENG SARY BRING BACK A LOT OF PEOPLE TO BE 
KILLED.  THE DAUGHTER CAME BACK.  LATER, HOR NAMHONG'S WIFE 
SAW HER DAUGHTER'S PICTURE ON THE WALL AT TUOL SLENG AND 
FAINTED.
