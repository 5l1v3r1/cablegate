SUBJECT: (S) GERMANY WARNS THE USG ABOUT A BRAZILIAN 
PROCUREMENT ATTEMPT OF PROLIFERATION CONCERN 
 
Classified By: Acting Global Affairs Unit Chief David L. Fisher 
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (S) On July 31, MFA Export Control Division Desk Officer 
Nancy Reck provided EconOff with a German-language non-paper 
warning US export control authorities about a potential 
Brazilian procurement attempt of proliferation concern for 
"Automatic High-Precision Heavy-Duty Necking-In-Machines with 
CNC Control" from a US vendor.  German authorities received 
an application from a German firm for the export of four 
Necking-In-Machines to Brazil, which they plan on rejecting 
for fears that these machines would be diverted to the Middle 
East -- probably Iran.  (COMMENT: The German producer of 
these machines was not mentioned or listed in the non-paper. 
END COMMENT)  The Germans based their conclusions on their 
own research and information from an unnamed "reliable 
source" (NFI).  Reck shared that Germany is confident in the 
strength of their legal position should the German producer 
challenge the rejection in court. 
 
¶2.  (S) Begin text of informal Embassy translation of 
German-language non-paper: 
 
In regards to our partnership in the area of 
non-proliferation and our excellent partnership in export 
control affairs, we would like to bring the following 
information to the attention of your government: 
 
A German firm placed an export application for four 
"Automatic High-Precision Heavy-Duty Necking-In-Machines with 
CNC Control" (Einziehmaschinen) with a total value of 
7,700,000 euro.  The machines are controlled by both the 
Wassenaar Arrangement and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). 
The stated recipient is the firm Export Business & Consult 
located in Brazil.  This firm's address is as follows: 
 
Export Business & Consult 
Av. Osmar Cunha 183-712A 
Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, 88015-100 
Brazil 
 
The end-user is listed as Export Business & Consult, Rua Ivo 
Luchi s/n Bairro Industrial, Palhoca, Santa Catarina, Brazil. 
 (COMMENT:  Reck said the term "s/n" in this sentence refers 
to "street name."  END COMMENT)  The stated end-use 
description is for the production of gas cylinders, pressure 
containers, and CNG-cylinders for automobiles. 
 
From a reliable "source", we have obtained the following 
information: 
 
-- The Brazilian authorities are investigating the receiver 
because of suspicion connecting the firm with procurement of 
dual-use goods, listed under the Wassenaar Arrangement, for 
diversion to the Middle-East. 
 
-- The firm has already tried to procure machine tools in 
numerous European countries 
 
-- The existence of a declared end-user could not be proven 
 
-- The declared receiver has neither the physical facilities 
nor the financial means or the technical possibilities to use 
the Necking-In-Machines for themselves. 
 
-- The previous activities of both firms give cause for the 
presumption, that it has to do with a front company without 
financial movement or registered business capital. 
 
-- According to the source's assessment, this case could be 
connected with the proliferation of critical goods to the 
Middle East (presumably Iran). 
 
We will reject this application.  Due to the long 
investigation time, the export applicant's legal 
representative shared that the Brazilian end-user could 
possibly make an effort to procure the machines from the USA. 
 
 
We look forward to the continuation of our excellent 
cooperation in the affairs of non-proliferation and export 
control.
