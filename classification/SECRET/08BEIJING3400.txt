SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR URGES INVESTIGATION OF SHIPMENT TO IRAN OF CHINESE GOODS OF PROLIFERATION CONCERN (S)

REF: STATE 93558

Classified By: Ambassador Clark T. Randt, Jr. Reasons 1.4 (b), (c) and (d).

¶1. (S) The Ambassador conveyed the United States grave concern regarding Irans lack of cooperation on the Iranian nuclear issue, its support for terrorist organizations, its destabilizing behavior in the Middle East, and Chinese sales of dual-use material and items to Iran to MFA Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jieyi in a September 3 meeting. AFM Liu currently oversees MFAs Arms Control and Disarmament Department. (The Ambassador also urged PRC support for the draft exception for India at the upcoming Nuclear Suppliers Group Plenary and responded to AFM Lius demarche on Taiwan-related issues. See septels.)

¶2. (S) Drawing on reftel points, the Ambassador, reinforcing a message the British delivered last month, expressed U.S. concern regarding a Chinese-origin shipment of proliferation concern that occurred in May and June. Transactions such as this one (reftel non-paper with details on the shipment was handed over) send the wrong signal to Iran by reinforcing the perception in Iran that it can continue to reject P5-plus-1 demands with impunity. The Ambassador urged China to investigate the shipment of the dual-use items, provide the results of that investigation and prevent future transfers of a similar nature.

¶3. (S) AFM Liu responded that, with respect to nonproliferation and Iran, China shares the same objective as the United States. He stressed that China has "stepped up inspections" of cargo destined for Iran from or through China and "tightened controls" in recent years. Liu said that Chinese laws prohibit the shipment of WMD-related items and promised to have the proper authorities investigate this transaction and "take action" if they find that the cargo sailed not in accordance with Chinese laws. He said there is no question of China sending the wrong message to Iran, adding that Chinas message to Iran is "to accept the P5-plus-1 foreign ministers letter and way forward paper."
