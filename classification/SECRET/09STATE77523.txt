Classified By: ISN/MTR DIRECTOR PAM DURHAM FOR REASONS 1.4 (B), AND (D).

¶1. (U) This is an action request. Embassy Kyiv please see para 3.

¶2. (S) Background/Objectives: The United States has information indicating that as of early 2009, Irans Malek-Ashtar University of Technology (MUT) was working to obtain training from international scientists, including scientists from Ukraine. MUT is subordinate to Irans Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL), which provides instruction to representatives of Iranian defense- and missile-affiliated entities, some of which are sanctioned by UN Security Council Resolutions. We want to urge Ukrainian officials to investigate this information and take steps to ensure that Ukrainian individuals and institutions are not providing sensitive technology and/or other support to MUT or other Iranian entities affiliated with Irans missile program.

¶3. (U) Action Request: Request Embassy Kyiv approach appropriate Ukrainian government officials to deliver talking points in paragraph 4 below and report response. Talking points also may be provided as a non-paper.
