  Classified By: Anne W. Patterson, Reasons 1.4 (b), (d) 
 
¶1. (S) SUMMARY.  On December 11, the Pakistani Air Force  (PAF) Liaison Officer (LNO) to the Office of the Defense  Representative (ODRP) told the ODRP Air Cell that PAF  aircraft had launched to intercept a Coalition aircraft that  had crossed the Afghanistan-Pakistan border via the standard  Coalition air corridor.  The aircraft was clearly a Coalition  airplane.  General Helmly has sent a stiff letter to the  Chairman JCS and the head of the Air Force and requested an  urgent meeting.  This action could have resulted in serious  consequences, so Post is raising the issue with Pakistan  senior military leadership.  This is the second incident of  this type.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (S) At 0602Z on December 11, the Pakistan military  detected an aircraft within the established (""the boulevard"")  airspace that serves as the flight corridor for Coalition  forces through Pakistani airspace.  (Approximately 150  Coalition aircraft traverse the ""the boulevard"" each day.)  The aircraft entered Pakistan's airspace from Afghanistan per  established procedures, but its transponder code (or  ""squawking"") failed to identify it as one of those scheduled  to cross the border.  Meanwhile, the U.S. CENTCOM Air Cell  located at Post was working to establish the identity of the  specific aircraft. 
 
¶3. (S) Shortly after 0700Z the Pakistan Air Force (PAF)  Liaison Officer (LNO) reported that Pakistani fighters were  scrambling to intercept the aircraft.  A few minutes later  PAF was notified that the plane had been positively  identified by the Air Cell.  The PAF LNO now says the  interceptors never launched. 
 
¶4. (S) We are reporting this because it is not the first  incident where the PAF has launched or prepared to launch  interceptors against what were clearly Coalition aircraft,  but which were not previously identified on an air tasking  order or were squawking an incorrect code.  Such incidents  have the potential to result in a serious international  incident.  Scrambling armed fighters to intercept armed or  support Coalition aircraft creates an unnecessarily dangerous  situation.  Any aircraft entering from Afghanistan can safely  be presumed to be a Coalition asset as the airspace is  monitored and controlled by ISAF. 
 
¶5. (S)  The US CENTCOM Air Cell located at Post is also  following up with appropriate ISAF elements to address the  fact that the aircraft in question was not adhering to all  established procedures for flying the corridor.  However, the  pilot's failure to squawk the correct code only led to  difficulty in identifying the exact aircraft - multiple other  indicators identified it as Coalition aircraft, especially by  flying within the Pakistan prescribed and approved corridor,  squawking in the clear, and demonstrating no aggressive or  threatening posture. 
 
¶6. (S) We are engaging with GoP to address this issue.  ODRP  Chief has drafted a message stressing our concerns and citing  the dangers of such intercepts to Pakistan's Chairman of  Joint Chiefs of Staff Tariq Majeed and Air Chief Marshall  Tanvir, and will raise in meetings as appropriate.
