¶1.  (S)  Ministry of Government and Justice Security Advisor 
Severino Mejia told POLOFF on July 19 that Panama supports 
OAS Guidelines for Control of MANPADS.  Importing or 
exporting this type of weapon into Panama is illegal.  Mejia 
wants to work with the Embassy to reduce smuggling of weapons 
and other contraband.  He is working closely with Costa Rica 
to secure Panama's western border. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Panama's Tocumen International Airport is an 
important commercial hub for all of Latin America.  Panama 
has a strong interest in preventing attacks on commercial 
aircraft.
