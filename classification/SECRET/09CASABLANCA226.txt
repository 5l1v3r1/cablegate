¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  At a December 9 meeting, one of Morocco's leading <br />
business entrepreneurs XXXXXXXXXXXX, told EconOff that <br />
major institutions and processes of the Moroccan state are being used <br />
by the Palace to coerce and solicit bribes in the country's real <br />
estate sector.  XXXXXXXXXXXX made clear to his XXXXXXXXXXXX interlocutors that Morocco's <br />
major investment decisions were in reality made by three individuals <br />
in the Kingdom:  Fouad El Himma the former Deputy Minister of <br />
Interior who now heads the Party of <br />
Authenticity and Modernity, Mohamed Mounir Al Majidi who is the head <br />
of the King's private secretariat, and the King himself.  "To have <br />
discussions with anyone else would be a waste of time", XXXXXXXXXXXX that, <br />
contrary to popular belief, corruption in the real estate sector <br />
during the reign of King Mohammed VI is becoming more, not less, <br />
pervasive.  END SUMMARY. <br />

A TALE OF ROYAL PROPORTIONS <br />

¶2.  (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX major <br />
institutions and processes of the Moroccan state are used by the <br />
Palace to coerce and solicit bribes in the real estate sector.  While <br />
corrupt practices existed during the reign of King Hassan II, <br />
XXXXXXXXXXXX, they have become much more institutionalized <br />
with <br />
King Mohammed VI.  Institutions such as the royal family's holding <br />
company, Omnium Nord Africaine (ONA), which now clears most large <br />
development projects, regularly coerce developers into granting <br />
beneficial rights to ONA, XXXXXXXXXXXX <br />
 <br />
¶3.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
 <br />
¶4.  (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX  ONA's XXXXXXXXXXXX <br />
reportedly told his interlocutors that Morocco's major investment <br />
decisions were effectively made by three individuals:  the King, <br />
Fouad El Himma the former Deputy Minister of Interior who now leads <br />
the Palace-backed Party <br />
of Authenticity and Modernity, and Mohamed Mounir Al <br />
Majidi, who is the head of the King's private secretariat and his <br />
principal financial advisor. <br />

 <br />
¶5.  (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX reality, of which most <br />
Moroccans dare only whisper -- the influence and commercial interest <br />
of the King and some of his advisors in virtually every major real <br />
estate project here.  A former U.S. Ambassador to the Morocco, who <br />
remains closely connected to the Palace, separately lamented to us <br />
what he termed the appalling greed of those close to King Mohammed <br />
VI.  This phenomenon seriously undermines the good governance that <br />
the Moroccan government is working hard to promote. <br />
