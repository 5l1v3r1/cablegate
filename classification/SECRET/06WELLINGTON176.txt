REF: A. 05 WELLINGTON 900 
     ¶B. STATE 204250 
 
(U) Classified by Political-Economic Counselor Katherine B. 
Hadda.  Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (S/REL NZ) A representative of Maritime Mutual Insurance 
Association NZ (MMIA) has told a New Zealand official that 
the company no longer insures North Korean vessels.  The 
representative believes that the North Korean ships that had 
been insured by MMIA are now being insured by the South of 
England Protection and Indemnity Association (Bermuda) 
Limited. 
 
¶2. (S/REL NZ) Paul Rankin, MMIA's Guernsey-based director, on 
March 2 told Gavin Quigan of the New Zealand Ministry of 
Economic Development's Insurance and Superannuation Unit that 
the "insurance tail" -- provisions that apply for a specified 
time after the insurance claims policy has been terminated -- 
of existing insurance contracts with North Korean ships will 
end March 31, 2006.  When asked if he knew who now insures 
those ships, Rankin said he understood that the South of 
England Protection and Indemnity Association (Bermuda) was 
now the protection and indemnity insurer. 
 
¶3. (S/REL NZ) Quigan said that Rankin apparently had been 
swayed by a claims dispute following what MMIA considered to 
be the intentional grounding of a North Korean vessel, in 
addition to damage to MMIA's reputation ensuing from negative 
publicity within the maritime insurance industry over the 
company's connection with North Korea.  This information was 
provided by Bruce McCallum of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade's North America Division, reporting a conversation 
he had with Quigan. 
 
¶4. (S/REL NZ) The New Zealand government does not consider 
MMIA to be an insurance company.  The government says the 
company does not meet New Zealand's legal requirements for 
issuing insurance, although it is incorporated in New Zealand 
(ref A).
