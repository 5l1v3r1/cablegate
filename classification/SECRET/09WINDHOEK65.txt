REF: WINDHOEK 63

Classified By: AMBASSADOR DENNISE MATHIEU for 1.4 (b) and (d).

¶1. (S) On February 25, Ambassador Mathieu met with Prime Minister Nahas Angula and requested a clarification of his recent statement regarding the possibility of uranium sales to Iran (reftel). Angula explained that he was not fully cognizant of UNSCR 1737 at the time he was interviewed by The Namibian newspaper, and consequently, he hedged his response so that Namibia would not become embroiled in a political dispute between the U.S. and Iran. Adding that he had been fully briefed on the provisions of UNSCR 1737 following his comment, Angula confirmed that Namibia would abide by UNSCR 1737 and would not sell uranium to Iran.

¶2. (S) He further stated that uranium sales were conducted in accordance with commercial contracts executed by Rossing Uranium Limited, with oversight by the Ministry of Mines and Energy. He noted that although Iran owned 15% of Rossing,s shares, Iran had not made a request to purchase any uranium products. (Note: Rossing shareholders have no uranium product off take rights, and the Government of Namibia has 51% of voting rights.)

¶3. (S) Comment: While Namibia has not publicly condemned Iran,s nuclear activities, we are satisfied with the Prime Minister,s explanation and believe the GRN,s position remains unchanged: it will comply with UNSC resolutions. Therefore, we do not believe a general demarche on Iran to the GRN in New York or Windhoek is warranted at this time. In previous discussions with Rossing management, Ambassador has been assured that Rossing has no intention of selling uranium to Iran either. If the Department has specific information about possible front companies for Iran, however, post suggests that that information be conveyed to the GRN and Rossing immediately.
