Classified By: CDA Michael H. Corbin for reasons 1.5 b/d 
 
¶1.  (S) Summary. As Washington policy makers consider ways to 
pressure the regime, one possibility would be to go after 
President Asad's money-men.  Four individuals Asad uses to 
make and move money are Zuhair Sahloul, Nabil Kuzbari, Asad's 
uncle Mohammad Makhlouf, and his father-in-law, Fawas Akhras. 
 Each is important to Asad and each plays a somewhat 
different role in facilitating regime graft.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (S) Sahloul (AKA Abu Shafic) is the most important 
black-market money changer in Syria.  When the Syrian Pound 
(SYP) devalued precipitously in the fall of 2005, the SARG 
gave Sahloul an office in the Central Bank and access to its 
hard currency reserves so he could intervene in the black 
market to stabilize the currency.  (Note.  Sahloul was 
surprisingly effective and within weeks the SYP appreciated 
20 percent, allowing Sahloul in the process a handsome profit 
for both himself and a handful of regime-insiders.  End 
note.)  Sahloul moves Asad's money using his own network and 
his access to Hawalis worldwide.  A Sahloul intimate bragged 
to us recently that Sahloul could move ten million dollars 
anywhere in the world in 24-hours. 
 
¶3.  (S) In addition to being the father of Syria's poster-boy 
for corruption, Rami Makhlouf, Mohammad Makhlouf has long 
served as a financial advisor to the Asad family.  If Rami is 
the face of corruption, Mohammad is the brain.  When Asad 
agreed to open the telecom sector to cellphone providers, it 
was Mohammad that some credit with conceptualizing the deal 
whereby Rami took over the first provider, SyriaTel, (long 
Rami's biggest cash-cow), and the second license (originally 
to SpaceTel, then Areeba 94, and now MTN) went to the 
first-lady's family (see para five below).  Long held in 
check by his brother-in-law, the late president Hafiz Asad, 
under Bashar Asad, Mohammad's avarice reportedly has no 
bounds.  As a result, the Makhloufs have had an at-times 
problematic relationship with Bashar and were forced to leave 
the country for a number of months in 2005 following one 
particularly heated exchange. 
 
¶4.  (S) Because of the Makhlouf's excesses and Asad's 
inherited propensity to limit the power and influence of his 
family members, Nabil Kuzbari has played an increasingly 
important role for the first-family. Known locally as "the 
Paper King," Kuzbari's base of operations has long been in 
Vienna.  In the last two years, however, he has developed an 
increasingly collaborative relationship with Rami and 
Mohammed Makhlouf.  Last year he served as Rami's frontman in 
establishing his holding company, Sham Holding, which brought 
together 70 of Syria's most-important business families to 
fund a number of Rami's most ambitious entrepreneurial 
projects.  In addition to lobbying European politicians to 
engage the Asad regime, Kuzbari reportedly uses his contacts 
in the Austrian business and banking circles to move regime 
assets abroad. 
 
¶5.  (S) In addition to being Asad's father-in-law, Fawas 
Akhras has been increasingly active in business here in 
Syria.  Akhras is the force behind the Syrian-British 
Business Council and recently put together a visit to London 
by a large group of Syrian businessmen.  Coming only lately 
to business, Akhras has stepped on a number of established 
business families who increasingly resent his assertiveness 
and willingness to use his son-in-law's position to advance 
his nascent Syria-based businesses.  Contacts in the banking 
sector have commented on the large amount of funds that have 
begun to move recently through his accounts.  A long-time 
resident of London, he is suspected of being another avenue 
used by Asad to stash funds abroad. 
 
¶6.  (S) Comment. Post has long advocated moving against 
individuals, like those listed above, who are intregal to 
allowing the regime to profit from its corruption.  Taking 
action against those linked to corruption is a win-win 
proposition: not only does it bring pressure on the regime 
where it hurts most - its pocketbook, but such a move would 
also be popular with the average Syrian who is the most 
common victim of the regime's avarice.
