REF: A. STATE 44313 B. MANAMA 117 C. MANAMA 20 Classified By: Charge d'Affaires, a.i. Christopher Henzel for reasons 1 .4 (b) and (d).

1.(S) Pol/Econ Chief delivered reftel demarche on April 29 to MFA Undersecretary Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa. At that time Al-Khalifa undertook to discuss possible co-designation with the Foreign Minister. P/E Chief made it clear that the USG intended to proceed on May 9 and that a response was needed by May 8. Follow-up queries met with no substantive response.

2.(S) On May 8, CDA met with Al-Khalifa to ask whether the GOB was prepared to move forward with a co-designation. He replied that the Foreign Minister had conferred with the Interior Minister and that action had passed to Interior. With the Interior Minister travelling outside Bahrain, CDA queried the acting Interior Minister, who stated he was unaware of the issue.

3.(S) Comment: While the GOB has indicated its support for the designations privately (refs B and C), it appears to be avoiding a public link to the move. Post does not believe GOB will provide a clear answer on co-designation and recommends proceeding with the expectation that the GOB will continue to support the designations privately.

4.(U) Tripoli minimize considered. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** HENZEL
