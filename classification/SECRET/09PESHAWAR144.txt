Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (S) Awami National Party (ANP) deputy leader Senator Afrasiab  Khattak distanced the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) from a  purported ISI plan to release  Tehrik-i-Nifaz-i-Shariat-i-Mohammadi (TNSM) leader Sufi Mohammad  and engineer the ""surrender"" of senior Swat militant leaders. 
Khattak maintained that ISI devised the plan under pressure to  ""contain"" Swat.  According to Khattak, the military is  continuing to pursue a strategy to divide South Waziristan  militant leader Baitullah Mehsud from other militant commanders  in the Waziristans, including the Haqqanis who are being treated  ""separately"" (NFI) by the military.  Senior personnel changes in  the NWFP, particularly the governor, appear to be off the table  for the moment.  ANP's relationship with President Zardari has  cooled and may further complicate the government's ability to  sort through tangled issues such as the fate of Sufi Mohammad  and Swat's militant leadership.  End Summary. 
  Plans for Sufi Mohammad's Release 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (S/NF) Khattak told PO July 3 that ISI is intensifying  pressure on NWFP Chief Minister Haider Hoti to place TNSM leader  Sufi Mohammad in ""provincial protective custody"" as part of an  ISI plan to engineer the surrender of senior Tehrik-i-Taliban  Swat leadership, including Mullah Fazlullah and spokesman Muslim  Khan.  ISI-proposed terms (NFI) of ""provincial custody,"" Khattak  said, envisioned allowing the TNSM leader greater freedom of  movement.  In return, Sufi Mohammad would declare implementation  of the Nizam-e-Adl regulation in Swat acceptable.  (Note: On  July 7, there were local press reports that Sufi Mohammad had  been released.  Post understands that the TNSM leader remains in  ISI custody.) 
 
¶3. (S) At the same time, Khattak said, TTP spokesman Muslim Khan  has been sending out feelers to the NWFP government about the  terms of a possible surrender of senior TTP leadership.  The  TTP-Swat spokesman, according to Khattak, was arguing that the  government had taken too long to fulfill its promise of  implementing the Nizam-e-Adl regulation.  However, TTP-Swat  senior leadership was purportedly prepared to lay down arms and  surrender if TNSM leader Sufi Mohammad pronounced the regulation  acceptable. 
 
¶4. (S) Khattak declared flatly that the provincial government  wanted nothing to do with this plan.  Operations in Swat, he  said, should come to a ""logical conclusion"" -- killing or  capturing militant leadership.  ANP leader Asfandyar Wali Khan  had instructed the Chief Minister to oppose taking  responsibility for Sufi Mohammad.  Wali Khan was also  suspicious, Khattak commented, because ISI Director General  Pasha had said nothing during a recent meeting about taking  custody of Sufi Mohammad.  Khattak speculated that ISI at the  provincial level is under pressure, however, to ""contain"" the  Swat problem. 
  Waziristan Plans 
---------------- 
 
¶5. (S) Khattak described a recent Apex Committee meeting where  Waziristan plans were discussed.  (Note:  The Apex Committee  consists of the NWFP Governor, NWFP Chief Minister, NWFP Chief  Secretary, 11th Corps Commander, and Frontier Corps Commander. 
Khattak frequently represents the Chief Minister.)  The  military, Khattak said, was still working to separate Baitullah  Mehsud from other Waziristan-based commanders, particularly  Mullah Nazir, Gul Bahadur, and the Haqqanis.  Following a July 2  jirga of Wazir elders, Khattak noted, Mullah Nazir had declared  his ""neutrality."" 
 
¶6. (S) Khattak described the Pakistani military as treating the  Haqqanis ""separately"" (NFI) from other militants.  The Haqqani  family, he observed, has already moved out of North Waziristan. 
Part of the family, he said, is living in a rented house on the  Kohat Road on the southern side of Peshawar.  The other half is 
  PESHAWAR 00000144  002 OF 002 
 
  living in a house owned by the Haqqani family in the Rawalpindi  cantonment. 
  NWFP Personnel - No Changes 
--------------------------- 
 
¶7. (S) PO noted past reports of senior personnel changes in the  NWFP and asked whether replacing Governor Ghani or Inspector  General Police (IGP) Malik Naveed was likely at this juncture. 
Khattak replied that Ghani was likely to remain ""governor by  default.""  ANP and President Zardari could not agree on a  suitable alternative.  (Note:  Separately, DCM understands that  Army Chief of Staff General Kayani has told Zardari that this is  not the moment to change the NWFP Governor.)  Naveed, Khattak  continued, had been more visible lately and seemed likely to  retain his position.  According to Khattak, Capital City Police  Officer Sifwat Ghayyur, whose name had been surfacing as a  possible replacement for Naveed, is experiencing health problems. 
  Increasing ANP Visibility 
------------------------- 
 
¶8. (C) Khattak said that ANP will hold a party meeting in  Peshawar, July 8-9.  Asfandyar Wali Khan will attend to improve  his visibility.  Khattak described with a note of skepticism  phone calls from Zardari and Interior Minister Rehman Malik to  Wali Khan urging him not to travel to Peshawar at various times  because of security concerns.  (Note: After a slow start in the  initial days of the IDP crisis, ANP, particularly the Chief  Minister, is appearing with much greater frequency outside  Peshawar.) 
  Comment 
------- 
 
¶9. (S/NF) The relationship between ISI, TNSM leader Sufi  Mohammad, and TTP-Swat leadership is a tangled one.  Provincial  government leaders have not forgotten that the military, and  particularly ISI, pushed hard and facilitated the failed  February peace deal in Swat.  While Khattak and other ANP  leaders continue to voice respect for senior military leaders in  Islamabad and Peshawar, there is tremendous suspicion of ISI and  the role it is playing in the NWFP and FATA.  Khattak commented  at one point that ""ISI's strategy is to save the taliban from  defeat.""  ISI's motives and activities are more complicated than  that statement suggests.  However, the ISI-brokered deal now  being described would likely undermine any progress the military  has made in reversing the public perception that the military  and local taliban are essentially the same entity.  ANP-Zardari  relations while not broken have a decidedly cooler tone since  the Swat deal and the impasse over selecting a new governor. 
The troubled federal-provincial relationship may make sorting  through issues such as this latest Sufi Mohammad-TTP Swat deal  even more difficult.
