SUBJECT: SWISS PRESIDENT MERZ APOLOGIZES TO LIBYA FOR \
HANNIBAL GADDAFI ARREST \
 \
Classified By: POLE Counselor Richard A. Rorvig; reasons 1.4(b) and (d) \
. \
 \
¶1. (S/NF) In a bid to win the freedom of two Swiss citizens \
who have not been permitted to leave Libya for over a year, \
Swiss President Hans-Rudolf Merz traveled to Tripoli August \
20 and met with Libyan Prime Minister ElBaghdadi Mahmudi. \
The unannounced visit culminated with Merz making a public \
apology for what he termed the "inappropriate and \
unnecessary" arrest of Hannibal Gaddafi, son of Libyan leader \
Muammar Gaddafi, in Geneva in July 2008.  Merz also signed an \
agreement with the Libyan PM seeking to "settle the dispute \
which resulted from the incident of the arrest."  (Note: \
Hannibal Gaddafi and his wife were arrested by Geneva \
cantonal authorities at a hotel in Geneva on July 15, 2008 \
for allegedly severely beating two of their domestic \
employees who were traveling with them.  Swiss officials \
consistently have confided to post that they have not doubt \
that Hannibal Gaddafi and his wife did in fact brutally \
assault the two domestic employees.  Hannibal Gaddafi and his \
wife subsequently were released from Swiss jail two days \
later, on bail of CHF 500,000 (USD 470,000).  Libyan leader \
Muammar Gaddafi responded angrily to the arrest by refusing \
to allow two Swiss businessmen to depart Libya, halting \
Libyan oil exports to Switzerland, and withdrawing \
approximately CHF 5 billion (USD 4.7 billion) from Swiss \
banks.  Swiss authorities dropped the charges against \
Hannibal Gaddafi and his wife in September 2008, but the \
crisis in Swiss-Libyan relations has continued.  End Note) \
 \
¶2. (SBU) Merz's public apology was the first condition of the \
agreement.  In addition, per the agreement, Switzerland and \
Libya will establish an "arbital tribunal" composed of three \
members:  two of the members will be from third countries, \
one appointed by Libya, and one appointed by Switzerland; the \
third tribunal member is to be selected by the two appointed \
members or by the president of the International Court of \
Justice.  The arbital tribunal is to meet in London and \
examine the treatment of Hannibal Gaddafi by the Geneva \
police and other Swiss authorities.  The agreement obliges \
Switzerland to pursue criminal prosecution against Swiss law \
enforcement officials, if the tribunal concludes there were \
violations of law.  Switzerland also is supposed to pay \
damages to the aggrieved party (i.e., Hannibal Gaddafi) in \
cases where the tribunal determines civil or criminal \
responsibility.  Though not specifically mentioned in the \
agreement, Merz has announced publicly that the GoL has \
promised to permit the two Swiss nationals under house arrest \
in Libya to leave Libya by September 1. \
 \
¶3. (C) The agreement -- and above all public apology by Merz \
-- has been subject to wide press and political commentary. \
Merz's political rivals have accused him of humiliating \
Switzerland and making a mockery of Swiss rule of law for \
agreeing to the Libyan demands.  Geneva officials have \
defended their actions in the arrest and complained loudly \
that they were not consulted ahead of time about the \
agreement that Merz signed.  The Swiss press, while echoing \
some of these concerns, generally has assessed the apology \
and the agreement as a "necessary evil" to obtain the freedom \
of the two Swiss nationals.  In an August 21 press conference \
in Switzerland, Merz defended his actions, saying it was \
necessary to obtain the freedom of the two Swiss nationals \
and to ensure future Swiss-Libyan economic relations.  He \
underlined that the decision to go to Tripoli was his alone, \
and not the result of a Federal Council decision, but that he \
had kept the Federal Council informed and that the trip and \
the agreement had the blessing of FM Calmy-Rey.  In the press \
conference, Merz struggled to qualify his implicit criticism \
of Geneva law enforcement officials without walking back his \
apology, which apparently is central to meeting Libyan \
demands.  At one point, when asked how he could judge the \
arrests to have been "inappropriate" before the arbital \
tribunal has made its determinations, a frustrated Merz \
temporarily lost his patience and muttered, "I know, I did \
everything wrong yesterday."  Without further comment, he \
took the next reporter's question. \
 \
¶4. (S/NF) COMMENT:  Merz has performed a precarious political \
highwire act with his trip to Libya, apology, and signing of \
the agreement.  If the two Swiss nationals are, in fact, \
permitted to return home, Merz may yet emerge relatively \
unscathed from this episode.  However, if Libya does not \
uphold its end of the bargain and permit the two Swiss \
nationals to depart, Merz likely will face the most serious \
crisis of his political career.  END COMMENT. \
