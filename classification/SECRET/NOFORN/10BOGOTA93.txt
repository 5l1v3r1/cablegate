¶1.            (S//NF)  Summary.  Blue Lantern Officer consulted 
with the Defense Attache Office, US MilitaryGroup (MILGROUP), FBI 
and DEA regarding the accuracy of  intelligence reports listed in 
ref A.   DEA confirmed the derogatory information in ref A, linking 
Vertical de Aviacion to Helitaxi, Helicol and Byron Lopez Salazar 
-- a known money-launderer.  In light of this information, Post 
does not recommend issuance of a license to Vertical de Aviacion to 
import goods on the U.S. Munitions List. 



¶2.            (U)   Other information requested in ref A is 
provided below.  End Summary. 



¶3.            (S//NF)   At the time of the initial Blue Lantern 
pre-licensing verification request for Vertical de Aviacion, no 
derogatory information was found on the company or its owner and 
CEO, as listed on the business registration provided to Post by the 
company (ref B).   The Department subsequently provided derogatory 
information about Helitaxi, the previous name of Vertical de 
Aviacion, and its owner Byron Lopez Salazar, and requested another 
review. 



¶4.            (S//NF)  Per ref A, BlueLanternOff verified that DEA 
has derogatory information on Helitaxi, the previous name of 
Vertical de Aviacion.  DEA confirms that the owner of Helitaxi, 
Byron Lopez Salazar, is a known money-launderer.  His name is 
indexed in 20 DEA case files.  However, the Colombian business 
registration of Vertical de Aviacion does not list Byron Lopez 
Salazar as an owner, although a Dunn & Bradstreet check does. 
According to officials at Vertical de Aviacion, the current owner 
is Mauricio Lopez Espinosa, son of Byron Lopez, and the CEO is 
another son, Fernando Lopez Espinosa.  DEA has no derogatory 
information on either son.  Fernando Lopez is a dual U.S. and 
Colombian citizen.



¶5.            (SBU)  The parent company of Vertical de Aviacion is 
Icaro International Services, which owns 80% of the company.  Angie 
Garcia (tel: 202-246-6814), the Executive Assistant at Vertical de 
Aviacion's offices in Washington, D.C.,  reported the following
