SUBJECT: MACEDONIA: RUMORED PLANS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL 
CHANGES AND CONCENTRATION OF POLITICAL POWER MAY THREATEN 
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT 
 
REF: SKOPJE 436 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR MILOVANOVIC, REASONS 1.4(B) AND (D). 
 
¶1. (U) This is a request for policy guidance (see paragraph 
5). 
 
¶2. (S/NF)  According to a wide range of credible sources, PM 
Gruevski's VMRO-led coalition plans to amend the constitution 
to allow for indirect election, by parliament, of the 
President (head of state).  VMRO's new coalition partner, 
eAlbanian DUI, has indicated to us that it would support such 
an amendment.  Such an action would end direct popular 
election for the office of the President, one of the few 
checks and balances on government in this young democracy. 
This has been a long-standing goal of Gruevski's, and with 
his new 82-seat governing majority (reftel), he now has the 
means to achieve it through a constitutional amendment. 
 
¶3. (S/NF) Limiting the President's independence through 
indirect elections would clear the way for a system in which 
the party in government could act without the possibility of 
dissenting views from the President, undermining democracy in 
 Macedonia.  It would give the ruling party control over 
appointment of the Chief of Defense Staff in the Ministry of 
Defense (MOD), weakening the civilian-military separation of 
power in the MOD.  It also would give the ruling party 
additional influence over the appointment of Macedonia's 
ambassadors, further concentrating power in the government. 
 
 
¶4. (S/NF)  The change from a direct to indirect election of 
the President would be retrogressive and harmful to 
democratic development in Macedonia.  Although the 
constitutional powers of the President are limited, the 
traditional independence of that office has had an important 
tempering effect on government policies and attitudes.  In 
recent months, the most notable example of this moderating 
influence relates to the name dispute.  President 
Crvenkovski's more flexible position related to the name 
negotiations, coupled with his statesmanship on the issue, 
was critical in persuading the government to accept the 
pre-Bucharest Nimetz proposal, and helped moderate public 
opinion on the issue.  Removing a directly elected President 
and further limiting his/her independence would clear the way 
for a mono-party system that could act without regard to 
minority political views. 
 
¶5. (S/NF) POLICY GUIDANCE REQUEST:  We request the Department 
instruct us to use the considerable influence the USG enjoys 
here to persuade PM Gruevski and his coalition partners to 
refrain from pursuing any action to amend the constitution to 
allow for parliamentary election of the president, and to ask 
other influential domestic and international actors to 
discourage it as well.  We would convey that message 
privately.
