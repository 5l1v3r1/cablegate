Summary 
 
---------- 
 
 
 
¶1.  (S//NF)  A Colombian offer, which appears to have been accepted 
by President Martinelli,  to mount a cross-border operation against 
FARC forces in Panama's Darien province has caused confusion among 
the GOP's senior security team and raised concern about 
coordination with USG efforts in that region.  The Ambassador has 
notified GOP leaders that a Colombian raid would have serious 
negative consequences for U.S. security cooperation in Darien.  End 
summary. 
 
 
 
Colombian Cross-Border Operation? 
 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2.  (S//NF)  Vice President/Foreign Minister Juan Carlos Varela 
called Ambassador on December 9 to express his concern over 
discussions within the GOP about a possible cross-border operation 
by Colombian forces directed against the FARC 57th Front in Darien, 
Panama.  Varela related details of a December 9 meeting between 
visiting Colombian National Police director General Oscar Naranjo, 
President Martinelli, and senior GOP security officials, in which 
Naranjo offered to direct Colombian forces to move over the 
holidays against FARC units in Darien.  Although Martinelli 
expressed a willingness to approve the plan, Varela was concerned 
that it was not coordinated with Embassy Panama's DEA-led operation 
in Darien, about which Varela has been briefed. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (S//NF)  The next day (December 10), Ambassador, DCM and PolSec 
officer met Varela, Minister of the Presidency Jimmy Papadimitriu 
and Minister of Government and Justice Jose Raul Mulino for a 
previously scheduled lunch.  Varela reiterated his concern about 
the Colombian proposal and insisted that there must be a 
coordinated plan between Panama, the U.S. and Colombia. 
 
 
 
Too Good to be True 
 
---------------------- 
 
 
 
¶4.  (S//NF)  In a sidebar conversation with Ambassador and DCM, 
Papadimitriu expressed misgivings about Colombian motivations, 
saying that some aspects of Naranjo's proposal "didn't add up." 
Naranjo told the group that the GOC had twice offered to the 
Torrijos administration to mount such a cross-border operation, but 
that Torrijos had refused.  Papadimitriu said both he and 
Martinelli were puzzled that Torrijos had refused, and they 
wondered whether Torrijos had a good reason for doing so. 
Papadimitriu noted that Naranjo had enthusiastically touted 
President Uribe's leadership repeatedly in the conversation, and he 
wondered out loud whether the proposed operations was more for 
Colombian domestic political purposes than for security. 
 
 
 
Two Plans are Too Many 
E 
 
 
-------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶5.  (S//NF)  The Ambassador reminded the ministers (reftels) that 
the Embassy has been working for several months to mount a DEA-led 
operation to take down key FARC drug trafficking figures, and a DEA 
FAST team recently arrived at post to initiate planning.  That 
effort is part of our larger Darien strategy of denying safehaven 
to the FARC and DTOs in the Darien, which is supported with 
extensive resources from DoD, State, and other agencies.  The 
Ambassador told the ministers that we would have no choice but to 
suspend our planned operations in the face of an uncoordinated 
action by the Colombians, because it would be unsafe for USG law 
enforcement to conduct operations in such an environment.  She 
observed that such a suspension would be widely noted throughout 
many agencies of the USG. 
 
 
 
Law Enforcement Means 
 
-------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶6.  (S//NF)  The Ambassador pointed out SOUTHCOM's view that a 
military assault against the FARC in Panama would be a violation of 
international law, given that the FARC is not engaged in a 
recognized insurgency against the government of Panama.  She made 
clear that a cross-border assault of the type that Colombia has 
conducted against other neighbors would likely cause SOUTHCOM to 
withdraw its support from the Darien, leaving Panama without vital 
training resources for its frontier police. 
 
 
 
You're Right! 
 
-------------- 
 
 
 
¶7.  (S//NF)  All three ministers said emphatically that a Colombian 
military-style attack would be disastrous for Panama, and that 
Martinelli would not knowingly approve such an action.  Mulino said 
he would seek a meeting with his Colombian counterparts to clarify 
their intentions. 
 
 
 
Alfaro Again 
 
------------- 
 
 
 
¶8.  (S//NF)  The Ambassador also reiterated her strong concern over 
the continued antagonistic attitude of Olmedo Alfaro, Secretary 
General of the Council of Public Security and National Defense (the 
GOP intelligence agency), who has repeatedly expressed his 
hostility toward DEA and other USG agencies (reftels).  The 
Ambassador noted that Alfaro was making an effort to insert himself 
into Darien with the intention of disrupting USG operations, and 
she warned that DEA and others would not continue to operate in 
Darien if Alfaro is involved on the GOP side.  She noted that the 
Embassy is prepared to work around Alfaro, as we have done with 
problematic figures in past governments, and that we have devoted 
considerable effort over the past few months to develop serviceable 
work-arounds. 
 
 
 
Comment 
 
 
---------- 
 
 
 
¶9.  (S//NF)  Embassy Panama is deeply concerned about this turn of 
events.  A Colombian cross-border attack would not serve U.S. 
interests in Panama, and would cause grave damage to our long term 
security cooperation.  An attack would hand a propaganda victory to 
Hugo Chavez, who would claim the attack was launched from a U.S. 
base in Colombia.  It would be unpopular with the Panamanian public 
and would arouse deep-seated Panamanian mistrust of Colombia and 
its intentions.  It would reinvigorate the anti-American left in 
Panama who would inevitably see a nefarious USG hand behind the 
action.  The resulting public outcry would surely cause a nervous 
GOP to restrict security cooperation, negatively impacting the 
permissive operating environment that USG law enforcement currently 
enjoys. 
 
 
 
¶10.  (S//NF)  In the short term, a cross-border operation would 
almost certainly scuttle the DEA-led operation which is central to 
the success of our Darien Section 1207 strategy.  For now, we are 
proceeding with meetings between the Embassy's Darien working group 
and SENAFRONT to develop a common picture of threats in the Darien. 
The next step will be a concept of operations which we will review 
in detail with the GOP as part of the process of weighing risks and 
benefits.  In the absence of any coherent GOP structure for 
reviewing security strategy, President Martinelli's tendency to 
glibly say yes to any proposal by a government he sees as an 
ideological ally adds an additional layer of complexity and 
unpredictability.
