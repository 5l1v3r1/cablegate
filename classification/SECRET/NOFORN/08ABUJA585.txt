SUBJECT: SALE OF NIGERIAN C-130S TO SENEGAL 
 
REF: IIR 6 871 0061 08 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Walter Pflaumer for reasons 1.4. (b 
& d) 
 
¶1. (S) SUMMARY: In a February 29 meeting with Nigerian Air 
Force officials, ODC Chief and Air Attach were apprised of 
the Government of Nigeria's sale-in-progress of three of 
their U.S.-purchased C-130 fleet to Senegal.  While it 
initially appeared that Nigeria might be in violation of 
end-use agreements with the USG, subsequent follow up leads 
Post to believe that the lack of proper paperwork is a result 
of the inappropriate handling of the case by a few Ministry 
of Defense (MOD) individuals, possibly hoping to profit from 
a quick sale.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a February 29 meeting with ODC Chief and Air 
Attach, Deputy Director of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) 
Logistics Mohammed Abbas stated that Nigeria had sold three 
C-130Hs to the Government of Senegal (GOS), using the Israeli 
firm A.D. Consultants as a middleman.  Abbas stated that the 
GOS had already transferred the $6.1 million to the GON, but 
the sale was still pending due to Department of State 
inaction on the Third Party Transfer (TPT) request.  ODC's 
March 3 inquiries to the offices of the Secretary of Defense 
(OSD), Defense Security Cooperation, Security Assistance 
Affairs, and the Department's Political Military Bureau (PM) 
about the status of the TPT request came up dry. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Subsequent research by OSD and PM, however, indicate 
the following timeline: 
26 April 2007 -- first payment of $3.05 million made to 
Nigerian MOD by GOS; 
22 May 2007 -- Formal Aircraft Sale Agreement (no. 5973) 
between MOD and A.D. Consultants on behalf of Senegal, 
acknowledging the need to seek USG approval of the sale prior 
to its completion; 
7 June 2007 -- letter sent by MOD Permanent Secretary to 
Post's Front Office requesting permission for the sale; 
23 August 2007 -- letter, but no DSP-83 Non-Transfer and Use 
Certificate, sent by Nigerian DATT Group Captain Zannah to 
Department requesting permission for the sale; 
15 November 2007 -- notice by Office of Defense Trade 
Controls to Nigerian DATT stating that application for TPT 
was denied, and requesting a resubmission of the request 
using a DSP-83.  DATT Abuja followed up with Nigerian DATT 
with further explanation of the proper way to proceed to 
obtain permission for the sale. 
 
¶4. (SBU) It appears no further action to file the DSP-83 was 
taken by the GON from November 2007 until the present time. 
The MOD, however, appeared during that timeframe to have been 
trying to effect delivery of the aircraft to Senegal.  Since 
the whole affair was brought to Post's attention, ODC and DAO 
have repeatedly warned the GON, both verbally and in writing, 
to stand fast until TPT is approved.  They have received 
assurances from the NAF that they are aware of their 
contractual obligations, are ensuring that the MOD is aware 
of them, and will not proceed with any sales until legally 
permitted to do so. 
 
¶5. (S//NF) COMMENT: Post believes this whole affair likely 
arose due to a few MOD civil servants intentionally failing 
to follow the law, possibly for personal gain (other sources 
report that the sale money was deposited into an unauthorized 
bank account, see reftel).  But it is also part of an 
historical pattern of the failure of MOD management to 
practice due diligence and take the time to read and 
understand the Air Force's contractual obligations -- and a 
long-term turf battle between MOD and NAF over NAF assets. 
The ODC and DAO are confident that the NAF is taking steps to 
ensure that the MOD halts all further actions toward 
completing delivery of this heretofore unauthorized sale, and 
on March 26 the Director of the Air Force said they would 
start working on the proper paperwork shortly.  We will 
 
ABUJA 00000585  002 OF 002 
 
 
continue to monitor progress and keep the Department 
accordingly informed.  END COMMENT.
