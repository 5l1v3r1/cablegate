¶1.  (S/NF) Dalton Ellery Barroso, a Brazilian scientist working for 
the Ministry of Defense, has written a book entitled "The Physics of 
Nuclear Explosives" ("A Fisica dos Explosivos Nucleares").  Post has 
found that this book is offered for sale to the general public 
through an online Brazilian bookstore.  The offer to buy the book 
can be found on the Livraria da Fisica's (Physics Bookstore) website 
at:  " http://www.livrariadafisica.com.br/ 
produto_detalhe.asp?id_produto=31458 " 
 
¶2.  (S/NF) An informal translation of the Livaria da Fisica's 
description of the book is as follows: 
 
"This book deals with essential themes needed to understand the 
physics of nuclear explosions.  Based on strictly academic 
scientific activities, the book is directed to those who would like 
to know more about the profound theories and processes involved in 
nuclear explosions.  The principal topics that are covered are 
neutrons and criticality (transport of neutrons); hydrodynamics and 
thermodynamics at high temperatures and densities; dense and heavy 
plasmas; opacity and transportation of thermal radioactivity; 
hydrodynamic theory of chemical detonations; shock waves, dynamic 
compression of solids, implosions; statistics on fission reactions; 
and fusion under inertial confinements (thermonuclear detonations). 
Three types of explosions are analyzed:  pure fission explosions; 
those referred to as "boosted bombs" (with the introduction of 
deuterium- tritium into the interior of the fissile mass); and 
thermonuclear explosions.  The results of numerical simulations and 
computer models (many of which have presumably never before been 
openly published as scientific literature) are presented and 
discussed."
