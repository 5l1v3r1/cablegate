SUBJECT: LIBYAN EFFORTS TO STOP THE FLOW OF FOREIGN FIGHTERS TO IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 50900 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Chris Stevens, CDA, Embassy Tripoli, Department 
of State. 
REASON: 1.4 (b), (c), (d) 
Â¶1. (S/NF) Information below is keyed to questions in paras 4-6 
of reftel tasker. 
 
- OBJECTIVE MASSEY NAME TRACES:  Names for Libyan foreign 
fighters recovered in the Objective Massey raid in September 
2007 were passed in GRPO liaison channels to the External 
Security Organization (ESO).    As of late November 2007, the 
ESO provided traces on those individuals (see TD-314/77022/07 
for further details). 
 
- COOPERATION WITH SYRIA:  Post assesses that Libyan-Syrian 
cooperation has been robust and productive.  The ESO maintains 
active channels of communication with its sister organizations 
in the Syrian Arab Republic concerning efforts to stop Syrian 
citizens from traveling to Iraq to conduct terrorist operations 
and to stop the transit of foreign fighters through Syria.  See 
TD-314/69907-07 and TD-314/68798-07 for ESO Director Musa Kusa's 
assessment of Syria's efforts.  Syrian Military Intelligence 
(SMI) transferred 27 Libyan foreign fighters to the custody of 
the Government of Libya (GOL) in late December 2007 (see 
TD-314/82371-07 for further details).  Information provided by 
ESO in liaison channels suggests that over 100 Libyan foreign 
fighters have been transferred from Syria to the custody of the 
GOL in the past two years. 
 
- DOMESTIC ACTION TO STEM FOREIGN FIGHTER FLOWS: Libyan 
officials have expressed willingness to take greater domestic 
action and to cooperate in regional and multi-lateral efforts to 
prevent Libyan citizens from traveling to Iraq to engage in 
terrorist operations.  Post's assessment is that the GOL has 
calculated that returning extremists pose a potentially serious 
threat to the regime's stability, and that efforts to stem the 
flow of Libyan foreign fighters to Iraq are in its strategic 
best interest.  See TD-314/034705-08 for details on ESO's 
detention of all known Libyan Iraq veterans that returned to 
Libya in 2004 and 2005.  The ESO's leadership has focused on 
counter-ideological measures, cooperation with neighboring 
states in the Sahara and Sahel region, and development of more 
stringent measures to sceen and track young men traveling 
to/from Libya. (See TD-314/69655-07 for details on combating 
extremist ideology; see TRIPOLI 120 and TRIPOLI 430 for analysis 
of factors enabling recruitment of eastern Libyans as foreign 
fighters; see TD-314/019998-08 and TD-314/019732-08 for details 
on ESO's cooperation with other North African states to combat 
foreign fighter flows; see TRIPOLI 248 for details on human and 
technical surveillance employed at airports by the Internal 
Security Organization (ISO) and ESO to prevent Libyans from 
traveling to Iraq and elsewhere to engage in terrorist 
operations.)  Indicating that Libya intends to improve the 
safety of its travel documents, Libya's National Security 
Council requested from the Charge on May 7 a list of U.S. 
companies that produce passports and travel documents with 
advanced security features, which Post provided shortly 
thereafter.  The GOL facilitated a port security training 
program under EXBS auspices in March 2008.  A parallel training 
program for airport security (fraudulent document detection and 
passenger screening techniques) is scheduled for July 2008, and 
a follow-on training program for land border crossing points is 
expected to take place in fall 2008.  Post's assessment is that 
the flow of foreign fighters from Libya to Iraq and the reverse 
flow of veterans to Libya has diminished due to new procedures 
adopted by the GOL (see TD-314/027806-08 for further details).
