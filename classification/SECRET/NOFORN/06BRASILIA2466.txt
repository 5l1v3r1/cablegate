Classified by Charge d'Affaires Phillip T. Chicola, Reasons 1.4 
(B) and (D). 
 
¶1. (S/NF) This is a coordinated message from all law enforcement 
and intelligence agencies represented at post. 
 
¶2. (S/NF) Post understands that Washington agencies are now 
planning to delay by one week, until November 29, the 
designation of nine individuals and two entities operating in 
the Tri-Border Area (TBA) as terrorist financiers under E.O. 
13224 (ref C).  Post echoes the concerns laid out by Embassy 
Buenos Aires (ref B).  In Brazil's case, law enforcement 
agencies at post do not have current operations that would be 
endangered by a precipitous designation.  Our currently strong 
law enforcement and intelligence relationships nevertheless 
stand to suffer from an unexplained designation action, to the 
serious detriment of our operational relationships here. 
 
¶3. (S/NF) Our relationships on the policy level stand to suffer 
as well unless we share substantial information justifying the 
designations.  Should Washington agencies decide to proceed with 
the designations in the near future, Post recommends that the 
maximum possible amount of evidence backing up the designations 
be shared.  Absent a substantive justification for these 
designations, Post believes the GoB will not freeze these 
individuals' or organizations' assets, leaving the door wide 
open for asset flight. 
 
¶4. (S/NF) Finally, an immediate public designation, without 
prior consultation with the GOB, will inevitably become a major 
source of discord at the December 3 to 4 three-plus-one meeting 
(Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and the U.S.) in Buenos Aires.  The 
three-plus-one is the only regional counter-terrorism forum in 
the Southern Cone conducted at a senior policy level. We will 
only be able to have a productive discussion of the designations 
at this forum if the GOB and GOA believe we have acted in good 
faith in supplying them with information and evidence on a 
government-to-government level before going public with the 
designations.
