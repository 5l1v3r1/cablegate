¶1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST. PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 4.
¶2. (S//NF) SUMMARY. The United States Government intends to
designate Muhammad Hamshu pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.)
13460 as early as January 12, 2009, but no later than January
16, 2009, for engaging in and facilitating public corruption
by senior officials within the Government of Syria.
Previously, the Department asked Embassy Ottawa to ask
appropriate Canadian authorities to confirm Hamshu's Canadian
citizenship (REF. A). A Canadian DFAIT official informed
Embassy Ottawa that Canadian privacy laws prevent the
government of Canada from disclosing information regarding
Muhammad Hamshu's legal status in Canada, including whether
he is a Canadian citizen (REF G). DFAIT and the Canadian
Department of Justice advised Embassy Ottawa to request this
information through Canadian law enforcement channels under
the terms of the mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT). DFAIT
and DOJ jointly recommended the request be referred to the
Canadian Foreign Central Authority for their consideration.
END SUMMARY.
---------
OBJECTIVE
---------
¶3. (S//NF) Treasury Department requests that Embassy Ottawa
notify appropriate authorities in the Government of Canada of
the United States Government's intention to designate
Muhammad Hamshu pursuant to E.O. 13460 during the week of
January 12-16, 2009, for engaging in and facilitating public
corruption by senior officials within the Government of
Syria. Hamshu is a corrupt business figure and member of the
Syrian parliament with close ties to senior Syrian regime
officials. Treasury welcomes any information the Government
of Canada (GOC) can provide on Muhammad Hamshu, specifically
confirming Muhammad Hamshu's Canadian citizenship, prior to
designation. If the GOC is not able to advise the USG of
Hamshu's Canadian legal status before January 12, the USG
would not/not publicly release at the time of Hamshu's
designation any reference to possible Canadian legal status.
