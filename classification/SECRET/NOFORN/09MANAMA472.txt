Classified By: Ambassador Ereli for reasons 1. 4(b) and (d).

1.(S/NF) In a 20 May 2009 meeting with Gen Petraeus, King Hamad welcomed the deployment of U.S. P-3 and tanker aircraft to Isa Air Base, along with related infrastructure upgrades associated with the movement of these aircraft.

2.(S/NF) The GOB is concerned that the deployment of P-3s and tankers at the same time would overload the current aircraft parking area and require construction to expand the existing ramp, but is willing to have the U.S. carry out this work.

3.(U) Embassy Manama requests details on the plans for these deployments in order to coordinate with the GOB.

¶4. (U) POC for this issue will be Maj Koester, 011-973-1724-2729. ERELI
