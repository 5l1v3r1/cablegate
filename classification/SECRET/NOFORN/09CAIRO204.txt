¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please see paragraph

¶3. 
¶2. (S/NF) Post appreciates the Department's efforts to quickly respond to Egypt's request for four Z portal multiview cargo and vehicle screening systems to improve their capacity to combat arms smuggling into Gaza (reftel). We are continuing to follow up with our GOE interlocutors to determine which Egyptian agency will operate the equipment, although EGIS will be the initial interlocutor.

¶3. (S/NF) Action Request: Post recommends identifying an expert willing to travel to Cairo for technical discussions with the GOE. The expert would provide information on the various systems available (mobile or stationary units) and offer concrete proposals for U.S. assistance.

¶4. (S/NF) Action request continued: We anticipate that Acting U/S Mull will be visiting Cairo on February 8 to brief the Egyptians on the Copenhagen workshop on Gaza interdiction. Post requests a status update on potential U.S. support for screening systems in time for U/S Mull's visit. SCOBEY
