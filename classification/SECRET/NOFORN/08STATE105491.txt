¶1.    (U) Action request contained in paras 2 and 3. 
 
¶2.    (S/NF) Summary: The USG has become aware that light anti- 
tank weapons (LAWs) and grenades supplied to Honduras under the 
Foreign Military Sales program were recovered in Mexico and 
Colombia. The Department's Bureau of Political Military Affairs 
is preparing a congressional notification (required by Section 
3 of the Arms Export Control Act) regarding the possible 
unauthorized diversion, misuse or failure to secure such U.S.- 
origin defense articles or defense services by the Government 
of Honduras (GOH). The Embassy is requested to raise this 
issue with appropriate GOH officials to ensure that GOH 
officials understand their legal end-use obligations with 
respect to control of U.S.-origin defense articles, that USG 
end-use monitoring is being completed, and that failure to 
fulfill their obligations may jeopardize certain aspects of 
future bilateral security cooperation. 
 
 
OBJECTIVES 
 
¶3. (SBU) Department requests Embassy pursue the following 
objectives with appropriate GOH Ministries of Defense (MOD) 
and Foreign Affairs (MFA) officials 
 
-- To remind GOH that is has retransfer, end-use and security 
obligations with respect to defense articles or defense 
services sold or granted by the U.S. 
 
-- To ensure that the GOH realizes the importance of ensuring 
strict controls over equipment, especially weapons, supplied 
under U.S. military assistance programs to prevent 
unauthorized transfers. 
 
-- To gain GOH commitment to accept responsibility for 
investigating unauthorized diversions and punish appropriately 
those held responsible. 
 
-- To obtain GOH action to strengthen controls on 
import/export of weapons and other military equipment. 
 
-- Reiterate U.S. support for on-going weapons destruction 
programs or new requests for future programs. Express U.S. 
willingness to provide physical security and/or stockpile 
management assistance to the GOH if requested. 
 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
¶4.    (S/NF) On July 9, 2008, the Defense Intelligence Agency 
(DIA) published a report entitled "Honduras: Military Weapons 
Fuel Black Arms Market". According to the DIA report, three 
light anti-tank weapons (LAWs) were recovered in Mexico City 
in January 2008, and one was recovered in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico 
in April 2008. Six more LAWs were recovered on San Andres 
Island, Colombia in March 2008. Factory markings analysis of 
lot and serial numbers undertaken by DIA's Military Materiel 
Identification Division (CHUCKWAGON)/MIO-5 indicates that these 
LAWs were part of a shipment of fifty sent to the Honduran 2nd 
Infantry Battalion's TESON training element.  The LAWs were 
originally transferred to Honduras in 1992 as part of a U.S. 
Foreign Military Sales program. 
 
      (C/HND) In April 2008, an investigation undertaken by 
the Honduran military found that the 2nd Infantry Battalion's 
TESON training element could not account for 26 of these fifty 
LAWs. 
 
      (S/NF) In addition, at least two U.S.-produced M433 40-mm 
grenades have beenrecovered in Colombia and Mexico, according to 
credible sources with direct access cited in the DIA report. The 
only foreign military sale of M433 40-mm grenades was to Honduras 
in 1985.
