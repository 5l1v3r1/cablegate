SUBJECT: DARIEN ACTIVITY UPDATE 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: STEPHENSON, AMB; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
FAST Team added to the mix 
 
 
 
¶1.  (S/NF)  Embassy Panama is advancing on many fronts in our 
Darien strategy to deny the FARC and other Drug Trafficking 
Organizations (DTOs) safehaven in the Darien. Built around our 1207 
funding request, the strategy now includes significant additional 
resources from SOUTHCOM, JIATF-South, and DEA that have been 
structured to support the overall goal of the strategy. Post is 
particularly pleased about DEA's dedication of one of their FAST 
teams (Foreign-deployed Advisory and Support Team) to Panama to 
begin direct counter-narcotics missions in the Darien and other 
areas of Panama. This team will work in the Darien with Panamanian 
law-enforcement elements to develop sources, evaluate the drug 
routes and flow through the region, and support direct law 
enforcement action to seize narcotics and arrest traffickers. The 
team will also evaluate the possibility of carrying out a joint 
arrest mission against FARC 57th Front Deputy Commander Luis 
Fernando Mora-Pestana, aka "Silver", indicted in U.S. Federal 
Courts for kidnapping an AmCit, and for material support for a 
terrorist organization. Four FAST team members are in Panama now 
working with the Country Team to define their mandate and examine 
existing intelligence. Post has set up an inter-agency working 
group to ensure seamless cooperation in the complex intelligence 
and logistical challenges the mission will present. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (S//NF)  Country Team has decided that the FAST team should 
initially concentrate on breaking the drug trafficking routes 
through the Darien, which have grown exponentially in importance 
during the last few months. There are growing indications that DTOs 
are storing large amounts of drugs on Panamanian soil, as indicated 
by a recent 2.5 ton seizure on the Caribbean coast, and the 
discovery of GPS on a captured go-fast with what are believed to be 
the coordinates of stash sites. The Gulf of San Miguel in Darien 
has become a central node of drug trafficking activity in the 
country, and the FAST team will give the DEA the capacity to extend 
its activities into the Darien in a more aggressive manner, and 
also provide the GOP with an end-game capacity it lacks in such 
remote areas. 
 
 
 
SEAL Training 
 
 
 
¶3.  (S//NF)  Post's Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) is 
supporting this initiative by having the Counter-Narco Terrorism 
Training Team (CNT), manned by SEALs from Special Operations 
Command South (SOCSOUTH), shift its training mission to a select 
group of the GOP National Frontier Service (SENAFRONT) elite 
Reconnaissance  Unit. This group would then work with the FAST team 
on counter-narcotics missions and on any possible High Value Target 
arrest mission. This will entail giving this group more high level 
training, and pushing the SEALS (who, along with other U.S. 
military trainers, were banned from entering the Darien just two 
years ago) deeper into the area. In keeping with their mandate as 
trainers, the SEALs will not participate directly in operations. 
SENAFRONT has also received training for the last two years from a 
SOUTHCOM Joint Planning Assistance Training (JPAT) team that 
regularly deploys to the Darien. This unit, which was the first 
group of uniformed trainers to enter the Darien, is focused on 
basic skills (medical, communications, logistics, maintenance and 
basic planning). 
 
 
 
MIST 
 
¶4. (S//NF)  ODC also has a SOCSOUTH Military Information Support 
Team (MIST) in Panama to support Post's Darien strategy. This team 
has conducted a psyop campaign in the Darien in support of 
SENAFRONT, encouraging voluntary demobilization of FARC members and 
offering rewards for information leading to the capture of key FARC 
57th Front leaders, including Silver. 
 
 
 
Civil Affairs 
 
 
 
¶5.  (S//NF)  Post is also awaiting the deployment of Civil Affairs 
elements from SOUTHCOM. The initial team of up to three planners 
will be sent to assist the GOP elements in charge of the 
government's activities in the Darien, both in Panama City and in 
La Palma, the capital of Darien. Together with a planner in the 
Embassy, they will provide a tremendous boost to the GOP, which 
historically is not good at strategic planning and has no recent 
counter-insurgency experience, while also giving the Embassy Darien 
Working Group day-to-day visibility on the GOP's efforts. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (S//NF)  In the near future, Post expects to welcome a civil 
affairs team that will be able to accompany GOP officials and 1207 
contractors deep into the Darien to assure that GOP and 1207-funded 
activities are following best practice learned in recent 
counter-insurgency operations, to prevent efforts from losing their 
focus on reducing the ability of the FARC and DTOs to operate in 
the Darien. 
 
 
 
Beyond the Horizon 
 
 
 
¶7.  (S//NF)  SOUTHCOM will have significant military personnel in 
the Darien from April to September of this year executing 
humanitarian assistance exercises, "Beyond the Horizon," and "New 
Horizon" (reprogrammed from Paraguay). These exercises will consist 
of Medical Readiness Training Exercises (MEDRETES) and engineering 
projects, including construction of schools and health clinics by 
U.S. military personnel. This could entail the presence of U.S. 
helicopters in the province for the first time, and will probably 
represent the largest U.S. military presence in the Darien in 20 
years. Post is tying this opportunity into our 1207 strategy, as it 
will provide direct benefits to the population, while increasing 
the GOP's comfort factor with having U.S. forces in the Darien. 
Post believes this will make it easier in the future to get 
permission for air assets to operate in the Darien, as may be 
required in support of the operations mentioned above. 
 
 
 
GOP Coordination 
 
 
 
¶8.  (S//NF)  The Ambassador has met twice with Minister of the 
Presidency Jimmy Papadimitriu to push for robust GOP efforts to 
provide better governance in the Darien, and has raised the issue 
repeatedly with Vice President/Foreign Minister Juan Carlos Varela. 
The Government is committed to working with us, but due to the lack 
of any real security or development experts in the government, Post 
is seeking a highly competent lower level official to take the 
lead. Danna Harrick, Secretary General of the National Council of 
Sustainable Development (an IADB-funded economic development 
E 
 
investment organization in the Ministry of the Presidency, which 
has worked extensively in the Darien), is emerging as a likely 
candidate. Harrick has identified a preexisting development 
strategy for the Darien, that was completed last year. The plan, 
which Harrick estimates would require $25 million in funding and 
close inter-agency coordination to succeed, is being analyzed now 
in the Embassy and the GOP.
