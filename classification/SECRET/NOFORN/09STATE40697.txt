¶1.  (S/NF)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS GREATLY APPRECIATE ALL 
EFFORTS TO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO ECUADORIAN SECURITY ISSUES. 
REPORTING HAS TIME AND AGAIN PROVED TO BE A VALUABLE RESOURCE 
FOR UNDERSTANDING IMPORTANT SECURITY ISSUES, SUCH AS 
PRESIDENT CORREA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MILITARY AND 
SECURITY FORCES, THE SITUATION ALONG THE NORTHERN BORDER, AND 
ECUADOR'S EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE ITS WEAPONS ARSENAL AND EXPAND 
ITS MILITARY TO MILITARY RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. 
ANALYSTS HAVE USED REPORTING IN RECENT WRITTEN PRODUCTION AND 
ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON ADDITIONAL CURRENT AND LONG-TERM 
PRODUCTION ON THESE TOPICS.  AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT, 
ANALYSTS WOULD READ WITH INTEREST ANY ADDITIONAL INSIGHT POST 
MAY HAVE INTO THE QUESTIONS BELOW, IF IT CAN BE ACQUIRED IN 
THE COURSE OF NORMAL DUTIES.  MANY THANKS, AND REGARDS FROM 
WASHINGTON. 
 
¶A.  (S/NF)  WHAT HAS BEEN THE MILITARY'S REACTION TO CORREA'S 
ELIMINATION OF MILITARY BENEFITS AND BUSINESSES?  HOW HAS THE 
LOSS OF THE MILITARY COMPANIES AFFECTED THE BUDGET?  WHAT 
PLANS DOES THE MILITARY HAVE TO COMPENSATE FOR THESE LOSSES? 
 
¶B.  (S/NF)  IN LIGHT OF RECENT BUDGET CUTS, HOW WILL THE 
ARMED FORCES ADJUST THEIR PRIORITIES?  WHAT IS THE STATUS OF 
THE SUPER TUCANO SALE? IS THE MILITARY STILL SEEKING TO 
PURCHASE RADAR EQUIPMENT FROM CHINA?  WHAT IS THE STATUS OF 
THIS DEAL?  WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES IS THE GOVERNMENT LOOKING TO 
FOR WEAPONS PURCHASES AND WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THOSE 
AGREEMENTS? 
 
¶C.  (S/NF)  HOW DO THE ARMED FORCES AND THE NATIONAL POLICE 
FEEL ABOUT THE DIMINISHING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US?  HOW 
WILL THIS IMPACT THEIR MISSIONS?  DO THEY EXPECT LOW-LEVEL 
COOPERATION TO CONTINUE? 
 
¶D.  (S/NF)  WHICH COUNTRIES IS ECUADOR TURNING TO FOR 
MILITARY ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION?  WHAT COUNTRIES ARE 
PROVIDING TRAINING TO THE ARMED FORCES AND WHAT DOES THIS 
TRAINING CONSIST OF? 
 
¶E.  (S/NF)  WHAT IS THE FARC'S CURRENT STATUS ALONG THE 
BORDER? 
 
¶F.  (S/NF)  WHAT OTHER CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES ARE GOING ON IN 
THE BORDER REGION?  WHICH GROUPS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE 
ACTIVITIES?  IS THE FARC INVOLVED IN THESE ACTIVITIES AT ALL? 
 WHAT IS THE MILITARY OR POLICE DOING ABOUT THESE ACTIVITIES? 
 
¶2.  (U)  PLEASE CITE C-AL9-00754 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF 
REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
