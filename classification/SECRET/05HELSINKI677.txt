SUBJECT: FINLAND: ORAL MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY ON IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 114212 
 
Classified By: POL Chief John Hall, for Reasons 1.4(B) and (D) 
 
(S) For Finland, the recipient of the Secretary's oral 
message is MFA Under Secretary for Political Affairs Markus 
Lyra, who will head the GoF delegation to the International 
Conference on Iraq.  Lyra is out of the country today, 
however, so we delivered the message to Aapo Polho, Director 
General of MFA's Department for the Middle East and Africa, 
and Leena Ritola, supervising desk officer for the Gulf 
region.  Polho and Ritola will accompany Lyra to Brussels. 
Ritola (who transfers this summer to become political 
counselor at the Finnish embassy in Washington), told us that 
the Finnish delegation does not expect to have any contacts 
with Syrian officials while in Brussels.  If they do, the 
Finns will stress the need for Syria to prevent the use of 
its territory by supporters of the Iraq insurgency.
