Classified By: PolCouns Tom Gibbons, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (S)  As relayed to Department via ref B telcon, poloff on 
November 2 delivered to the Department of Foreign Affairs 
reftel C points regarding the actions of U.S. naval vessels 
that responded to the Panamanian tanker M/V Golden Nori's 
call for assistance off the coast of Somalia.  The DFA was 
unable to provide additional information regarding the 
identity of Filipinos among the crew.  Points of contact for 
the case are Special Assistant Lorenzo Junco and Executive 
Director Cresente Relacion, of the Office of the 
Undersecretary for Migrant Worker Affairs. 
 
¶2. (S)  As requested reftel A, poloff on November 7 further 
discussed the Golden Nori case with Executive Director 
Cresente Relacion, outlining that the U.S. is considering a 
range of options, and will continue to consult with affected 
states regarding any actions.  When Mr. Relacion was asked 
about Philippine legal procedures and precedents that might 
enable the Philippines to accept custody of, and prosecute, 
persons apprehended in connection with the piracy of the 
Golden Nori, Mr. Relacion responded that since the tanker was 
not Philippine flagged and the incident did not occur in 
Philippine territorial waters, there was no basis or 
precedent under Philippine law for prosecution of the 
pirates.  He went on to ask that the Embassy keep the 
Philippine government apprised of developments in the case.
