¶1. (S) Summary. During an October 19 stopover in 
Auckland, EAP A/S Christopher R. Hill met MFAT Secretary 
Simon Murdoch to review regional and bilateral issues. They 
agreed that the Pacific Islands Forum had produced good 
results, holding the line on elections in Fiji and RAMSI in 
the Solomons. Prospects in Fiji remained uncertain with a 
fractured opposition facing a military accustomed to 
authority. Hill said he had told Solomons Foreign Minister 
Oti that RAMSI is the best thing the Solomons has going 
for it.  Murdoch then turned to Foreign Minister Peters' 
upcoming trip to Pyongyang and his determination to support 
the Six-Party process; he asked what topics the U.S. would 
want Peters to emphasize or avoid.  Hill stressed the need 
to emphasize that New Zealand and others could offer 
substantial assistance to North Korea, but it was 
conditional on DPRK implementation of its Six-Party 
commitments.  He reviewed the latest Six-Party developments 
and next steps on disablement and further denuclearization. 
Hill said he had urged Pyongyang to respond to Japan's 
concern over abductees, and he recommended Peters do the 
same.  On bilateral relations, Murdoch indicated that when 
Peters meets the Secretary in Washington, he would renew an 
invitation for her to visit New Zealand on her way to or 
from Ausmin next year.  He said New Zealand is actively 
considering ways to increase its development assistance in 
Afghanistan, initiate training for Afghan police, and 
possibly deploy the SAS to Afghanistan.  Murdoch said that 
Peters also hopes to explain New Zealand's response on the 
Asia Pacific Democracy Partnership.  Hill urged Peters to 
review these developments with the Secretary.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During an October 19 stopover in Auckland 
after the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), EAP Assistant 
Secretary Christopher R. Hill discussed a range of regional 
 
SIPDIS 
and bilateral issues with Secretary Simon Murdoch of New 
Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT). 
MFAT Deputy Secretary John McArthur and America's Division 
officer James Waite accompanied Murdoch; Wellington DCM 
David Keegan (note taker) and EAP Special Assistant 
Christopher Klein accompanied A/S Hill. 
 
PIF Outcomes Positive on Fiji and Solomons 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (C) A/S Hill said the PIF had produced a 
good outcome on pressuring the interim government in 
Fiji to move toward elections without delay.  Commodore 
Frank Bainimarama had been looking for the Forum to help give 
him a way out of the political crisis he had created, but 
that was placing hope over reality.  Murdoch said he 
had feared that the Forum would "choke" on Fiji and on 
RAMSI, but the member states had held the line.  Prime 
Minister Clark, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir 
Michael Somare, and the Samoan Prime Minister Tuila'epa 
had all taken a strong position.  Australian Foreign 
Minister Downer had said he was pleased with the outcome, 
especially with Clark's performance. 
 
¶4. (C) Murdoch added that these positive results 
will make it easier to move Fiji forward toward elections 
with a carrot and stick approach.  Bainimarama had urged the 
Forum leaders not to endorse the roadmap laid out by the 
PIF foreign ministers, but they held the line.  The U.S. and 
New Zealand now need to work with the PIF members to 
counter Bainimarama's efforts to portray the Forum members 
and partners as bullies.  He added that New Zealand very 
much appreciated that DAS Davies had pushed back during his 
meeting with Bainimarama in New York against Chinese 
efforts to undercut international and regional pressure on 
the Fijian interim regime.

¶5. (C) Hill observed that Bainimarama appears to be 
casting himself as a Chavez-style populist, but the Fijian 
people do not seem persuaded.  Still, the U.S. Embassy in 
Suva was very concerned that the opposition remained 
fractured and apparently incapable of forming a strong 
coalition.  He concurred with Murdoch's observation that the 
Fijian military had had three generations to build itself 
into a strong cohesive political and social force. 
Nonetheless, it remained for the Fijian people to make 
democracy work. 
 
¶6. (C) A/S Hill reported that in his meeting with 
Solomons Foreign Minister Patteson Oti he said RAMSI is 
the best thing that has happened to the Solomon Islands, 
and the government should support it.  It would not help the 
Solomons to get cross-wise with the countries in the region 
that have contributed to RAMSI.  Oti responded by insisting 
that the government supports RAMSI but has to honor its 
own parliamentary processes in completing the current 
review of RAMSI, A/S Hill said.  These were excuses for the 
government's current refusal to support RAMSI.  The decision 
of the Solomon's Prime Minister to boycott the PIF, citing a prior 
obligation to attend the Taiwan meeting of Pacific 
heads of government, had not gone over well with the 
assembled leaders. 
 
 
Preparing Foreign Minister Peters' Visit to North Korea 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶7. (S) Murdoch then turned to preparations for 
Foreign Minister Winston Peters' November visit to North 
Korea.  He said the Minister is determined to use the 
visit to support the Six-Party process in every way 
possible.  Peters plans to stress to the North Koreans 
that he considers it the responsibility of all nations to 
support the Six-Party Talks.  New Zealand wants to help 
bring North Korea out of its isolation, but only provided 
that North Korea follows through on its Six-Party 
commitments.  It would be helpful, Murdoch added, to know 
what the "red lines" would be for the U.S. 
 
¶8. (S) Hill observed that North Korea has something of a 
"Cargo Cult" mentality and expects visitors to offer 
presents.  It might be helpful for New Zealand to offer some 
small form of aid during Peters' visit, while saying that it 
could do far more, such as provide economic and financial 
assistance, and training in English language proficiency, 
but only if the North follows through on its Six-Party 
commitments.  The message would be that New Zealand and 
like-minded countries are prepared to offer more, but only 
if the DPRK denuclearizes. 
 
¶9. (S) Turning to the current status of the Six- 
Party Talks, Hill observed that the talks are coming to 
three critical milestones.  The first involves disabling the 
plutonium enrichment facilities in Yongbyon.  The second step 
is securing a full declaration from Pyongyang of all its 
nuclear programs.  The third is persuading the DPRK to 
surrender the enriched plutonium it already possesses.  This material 
is likely in the hands of the Korean People's Army, 
and it will take considerable effort to persuade them to 
release it. 
 
¶10. (S) Murdoch asked where the U.S. stands on the 
normalization track of the talks.  Hill said that the U.S. 
would move ahead with removing North Korea from the list of 
state supporters of terrorism and terminating application of 
the Trading with the Enemy Act only if the DPRK makes 
continued progress on denuclearization.  In this context, 
Murdoch asked about the current status of Japan's demand 
for North Korea to make progress on Japanese abductees. 
McArthur noted that Japan had asked New Zealand to raise the 
issue in Pyongyang.  Noting that abductions had become a 
 
WELLINGTON 00000785  003 OF 003 
 
 
major political issue in Japan, Hill said he had urged North 
Korea to find a way to be more responsive and to help new 
Japanese Prime Minister Fukuda make progress on this issue. 
He emphasized that he had told North Korea it is in its own 
interest to improve relations with Japan -- and for the U.S. 
to have good relations with Japan.  Meanwhile, normalization 
discussions could proceed in parallel with progress on 
denuclearization. 
 
¶11. (S) As for a Korean peninsula peace settlement, Hill 
also noted that the ROK Reunification Ministry had sought prematurely 
for the North-South summit to make a declaration 
that a peace treaty would be completed.  MOFA had then worked 
to persuade President Roh not to support such a declaration.  Against 
this backdrop, the U.S. wants to avoid becoming an 
issue in the current election campaign in South Korea so we 
intend to take a low-key approach.  A/S Hill urged Peters to 
beware of any reference to a "peace declaration." 
 
U.S.-N.Z. Relations 
------------------- 
 
¶12. (C) Murdoch then turned to U.S.-New Zealand 
bilateral relations.  He said he was still hearing good 
feedback from the Partnership Forum in Auckland in 
September.  He thanked Hill for attending and noted that the 
Forum had strengthened both public and private sector 
support for efforts to improve the relationship.  Murdoch 
recalled that he had mentioned to Hill when they met during 
the Forum (Reftel) that a Presidential visit in a year with 
elections on both sides might be difficult to manage, but 
New Zealand would welcome a visit by the Secretary of 
State.  He had subsequently spoken to the Prime Minister and 
Foreign Minister, and they had both endorsed that 
assessment.  He suggested that a visit by the Secretary on 
the way to or from the AUSMIN would be very welcome, and he 
expected the Foreign Minister would renew that invitation 
when he visits Washington November 19.  Hill responded that 
the Secretary very much appreciates the Foreign Minister's 
strong support on North Korea and is interested in coming. 
 
¶13. (C) Murdoch said he considers the coming year a time 
to bank the gains we had made over the past year and keep 
the public profile of the relationship positive through the 
course of our elections. New Zealand is very conscious of the 
importance the U.S. attaches to New Zealand's support in Afghanistan. 
 The government is considering expanding its development assistance, 
initiating police training, and 
possibly deploying the SAS again.  New Zealand is also 
considering bringing Afghan police trainees to New Zealand, 
probably under NATO auspices.  He added that Foreign Minister 
Peters would try to have something to say on the Asia Pacific 
Development Partnership (APDP) when he sees the Secretary.
