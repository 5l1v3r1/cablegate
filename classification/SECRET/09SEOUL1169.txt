TO THE PRESIDENT FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL SECURITY
KIM SUNG-HWAN
REF: SEOUL 01080

Classified By: Ambassador Stephens. Reasons 1.4(b/d)
¶1. (S) SUMMARY: NSA Kim told A/S Campbell during a July 20 meeting that the ROK believed the North Korean regime could "hold on for sometime" after the death of Kim Jung-il. In the case of a total collapse, Kim unambiguously stated that North Korean territory is part of the ROK and unification is the only goal. Kim believed China had instructed North Korea to cease nuclear test and provocations along the NLL/DMZ. ROK is monitoring rainfall in North Korea and considering aid with "no strings attached." The ROKG is also watching the current political events in Japan with interest. END SUMMARY.

¶2. (C) EAP A/S Kurt Campbell met ROK Senior Secretary to the President for Foreign Affairs and National Security Kim Sung-hwan for 30 minutes on July 20. A/S Campbell emphasized the importance for close U.S.-ROK policy coordination towards North Korea. NSA Kim said this is the first time North Korea is "feeling the sanctions" and realizing the consequences.

-------- POST KJI --------

¶3. (S) On a possible North Korean government collapse, Kim said even if something happens to Kim Jung-Il (KJI) the regime could continue for sometime. Kim analyzed KJIs decision to appear in public since May in obvious poor health as a warning to North Koreas to prepare for change. In a post-KJI scenario, Kim said the regime could continue if they could unify and put together some type of collective leadership support, although there is no history of collective government. ROK intelligence sources have indicated that KJI is trying to slow down the succession process. While it is uncertain if the DPRK leadership will accept Kim Jong-un as the "heir," there is always the possibility of someone else being appointed "regent" until he "comes of age."

¶4. (C) On possible post-regime collapse scenarios, Kim advised that according to the ROK Constitution, North Korea is part of the Republic of Korea. Some scholars believe that if the North collapses, some type of "interim entity" will have to be created to provide local governing and control travel of North Korean citizens. For Kim, there was no ambiguity: the DPRK is Korean territory and the goal remains unification. In this scenario, Chinas reaction needs to be considered and substantial international assistance will be required. Kim noted the benefits of ROK-Japan-U.S. trilateral cooperation, but stressed the need to get China to discuss contingency planning.

-------------------- CHINA AND DPRK NUKES --------------------

¶5. (C) Speculating on Chinas reluctance to engage with the U.S. and ROK, Kim said there are still those in power who supported North Korea in the Korean War and these "blood ties" are strong. Younger Chinese officials do not support current North Korean policy but would prefer to see direct U.S.-DPRK talks which would take the burden off of China. Kim said China would certainly lose influence with North Korea if they supported Five Party Talks.

¶6. (C) Turning to North Koreas nuclear campaign, Kim said the North Koreans had not removed any facilities from the caves near Punggyeri. However, he believed that the Chinese clearly told the North Koreans there could be no more nuclear tests. Coincidently, activities along the DMZ and NLL have been quiet for the last five weeks. Kim found it interesting that there have been no further North Korean reactions to UN sanctions, beyond the demand for an apology from the UN, This action was further proof of the weakness of the North Koran Foreign Ministry and was likely issued from another government entity. A/S Campbell asked if the ROK had other lines of communication with North Korean officials outside of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs channels. Kim said not only is there no other channel but that the current channel is strained due to discussions on the future of the Kaesong Industrial Complex. He said the North Koreans just want to talk about money and basically told the ROK to let them know "when South Korea is ready to pay."(See reftel)

¶7. (C) Kim said the ROK is monitoring rainfall in the
Pyongyang region and is concerned that flooding will damage crops, making humanitarian assistance necessary. If so, the ROK is considering providing "no conditions attached" food aid.

----- JAPAN -----

¶8. (C) Regarding ROK-Japan-U.S. trilateral cooperation, A/S Campbell asked Kim for an assessment of ROK-Japan bilateral relations. Kim said Korea has good relations with the current government but "history issues" (such as Dokdo) have complicated the agenda. A/S Campbell urged Kim to reach out to the new Japanese government soonest. STEPHENS
