 (S) Poloff delivered Karadzic family travel restriction 
objectives at first possible opportunity to MFA Deputy 
Director General Anu Laamanen August 12.  Laamanen said that 
she would study our points, but added that the crisis in 
Georgia had pushed the matter to the back burner in the MFA 
(and the EU in general).
