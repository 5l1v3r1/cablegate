¶1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE FOR ISLAMABAD, CAIRO, SANAA, AND GCC STATES. PLEASE SEE PARAS 3 AND 4 BELOW. TASHKENT, PESHAWAR, LONDON: THIS CABLE IS FOR YOUR INFORMATION ONLY.

¶2. (U) THE USG IS VERY CONCERNED BY STATEMENTS MADE BY TERRORIST OSAMA BIN LADEN AT A MAY 26 PRESS CONFERENCE IN KHOST, AFGHANISTAN. BIN LADEN REPORTEDLY SAID: "ALL MUSLIMS MUST DECLARE JIHAD AGAINST THEM (THE U.S. TROOPS) AND EXPEL THEM FROM THE HOLY LAND (SAUDI ARABIA) .... THE JIHAD FATWA HAS INDEED BEEN ISSUED." BIN LADEN ALSO INDICATED THAT AN ATTACK COULD TAKE PLACE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

¶3. (S) THE USG TAKES THESE STATEMENTS VERY SERIOUSLY. WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE SPECIFIC INFORMATION REGARDING TARGET OR TIMING, THERE ARE OTHER INDICATIONS THAT BIN LADEN MAY BE PLANNING AN IMMINENT ATTACK AGAINST U.S. OR SAUDI - INTERESTS IN THE PERSIAN GULF. DEPARTMENT THEREFORE REQUESTS THAT AMBASSADOR OR CHARGE APPROACH APPROPRIATE SENIOR OFFICIALS OF THE HOST GOVERNMENT AND DELIVER THE POINTS IN PARA 4 BELOW.

¶4. (S) BEGIN POINTS.

- ON MAY 26, TERRORIST FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN ADDRESSED A PRESS CONFERENCE IN AFGHANISTAN AT WHICH HE AGAIN CALLED FOR VIOLENT ATTACKS AND A JIHAD ON U.S. FORCES IN THE PERSIAN GULF. HE INDICATED THAT SUCH ATTACKS COULD OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

- THESE STATEMENTS ARE ONLY THE LATEST IN A LONG STRING OF BIN LADEN THREATS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS AROUND THE WORLD.

- THE USG TAKES- THESE THREATS VERY SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE OTHER INDICATIONS THAT BIN LADEN MAY BE PLANNING AN ATTACK AGAINST AMERICAN INTERESTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

- WE ASK YOUR GOVERNMENTS ASSISTANCE IN THWARTING SUCH AN ATTACK.

- SECOND, IF YOU ARE AWARE OF ANY BIN LADEN ASSOCIATES IN YOUR COUNTRY, WE ASK THAT YOU INTERROGATE THEM AND WATCH THEIR ACTIONS CLOSELY TO SEE IF YOU CAN LEARN ANYTHING MORE OF PLANNING FOR AN ATTACK.

- FINALLY, WE ASK THAT YOU SHARE WITH US ON AN URGENT BASIS ANY INFORMATION YOU LEARN ON BIN LADEN OR HIS ASSOCIATES.
