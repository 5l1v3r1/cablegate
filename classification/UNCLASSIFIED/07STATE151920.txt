¶2.  Begin Text: 
 
Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
Thank you for your invitation to the G8/Outreach Foreign 
Ministers Meeting in Berlin on "the role of foreign 
policy in guaranteeing a secure energy supply and protecting 
the global climate."  Regrettably, my schedule 
does not permit me to attend this important meeting. 
Nonetheless, I would like to propose that Under 
Secretary of State Reuben Jeffery, who serves as the G8 
 
SIPDIS 
Foreign Affairs Sous-Sherpa and the Department of 
State lead on energy issues, participate in my stead. 
 
As I strongly support these initiatives, I look forward to 
hearing results of the meeting and wish you success 
in your discussions. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Condoleezza Rice
