SUBJECT: STRENGTHENING AGRICULTURAL CREDIT IN AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1. Summary:  There is broad agreement within the Afghan government 
and among donors that a dramatic increase in the availability of 
agricultural credit is critically needed to rebuild Afghanistan's 
agricultural sector.  Recognizing this goal, the Minister of 
Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) Mohammad Asif Rahimi, 
newly nominated this past week for another 5 year term, would like 
to consider a range of options on how best to accomplish this goal. 
He has also emphasized that this credit assistance should utilize 
new products and reflect a new model of doing business.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. On December 8, Ambassador Wayne met with the Minister Rahimi to 
discuss the agriculture credit issue.  Minister Rahimi said he is 
not against the resurrection of a "bank," but he is against the 
former bank management, former management practices and former 
products used by the bank.  He requested the Embassy support a 
thorough study of the past model and of other institutions and 
models that may be better suited for Afghanistan today. 
Specifically, he said he mentioned options for a new public-private 
bank, a new public bank and for funding using private sector 
mechanisms perhaps with subsidized interest rates.  After careful 
review of these options and consultation with his staff, the 
Minister said he would approve one of the credit options, based on 
their relative merits.  He would then propose this option to the 
GIROA Ministry of Finance and to donors for funding.  If the study 
demonstrated that there would be a benefit to a new public bank and 
to call the new institution the Agricultural Development Bank, 
Minister Rahimi said he has no objection, but it should have new 
management, new products and represent a new model. 
 
¶3. Post would like to ensure that we are able to provide Minister 
Rahimi with a good assessment of several strong potential options 
for providing agricultural credit in Afghanistan, as he has 
requested.  We may have a preferred option among the options we 
present, but it will solidify our relationship with this key 
minister to provide a range of options with pros and cons.  Embassy 
would appreciate rapid USAID and USDA assistance in developing 
options.
