¶1. Summary: As the upcoming Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections 
stayed in the spotlight of the Taiwan media, news coverage on 
December 7 also focused on Taiwan's winning two gold medals in soft 
tennis in the Asian Games in Doha Wednesday.  In terms of editorials 
and commentaries, an editorial in the pro-unification "United Daily 
News" strongly criticized President Chen Shui-bian and his 
administration's performance over the past six-and-a-half years. 
The article said Taiwan's survival depends on the rapidly declining 
legitimacy of President Chen's reign.  An editorial in the 
limited-circulation, pro-independence, English-language "Taipei 
Times," on the other hand, discussed the "absurd" and "meaningless" 
name of "Chinese Taipei," a tag Taiwan's athletes have to bear when 
they take part in international events.  End summary. 
 
¶2. Taiwan's Political Situation 
 
"Eye of Typhoon: Taiwan's Chance of Survival Lies in the Weakening 
of Chen Shui-bian" 
 
The pro-unification "United Daily News" [circulation: 400,000] 
editorialized (12/7): 
 
"... Over the past six-and-a-half years, Chen Shui-bian has 
shattered Taiwan's dreams - in addition to the plunge of the stock 
market, the exhausted economic situation, and the island's 
marginalization, we have also seen disillusionment over deepening 
democracy and frustration in the ideals for reform.  ...  Now that 
there is nothing left of Chen's legitimacy, Taiwan has paradoxically 
entered a moment of tranquility, as in the 'eye of typhoon.'  For 
the island, the moment when the legitimacy of Chen's reign is 
rapidly declining, it is exactly where this nation and society's 
chance of survival lies.  Chen is trying desperately to rise to 
power again using this year's Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral 
elections.  Will Taiwan lose the tranquility of the 'eye of typhoon' 
and fall into the heavy storm caused by Chen again should he regain 
his power?" 
 
¶3. Cross-Strait Relations 
 
"Let's Dump 'Chinese Taipei'" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language "Taipei Times" [circulation: 
30,000] editorialized (12/7): 
 
"Viewers around the world were wowed by the creative spectacle of 
Friday's opening ceremony for the Asian Games in Doha.  As the 
audience applauded the entrance of delegates from 45 Asian nations 
and regions into the stadium, many Taiwanese viewers couldn't help 
but feel frustrated when they saw the delegation from Taiwan 
marching under the absurd 'Chinese Taipei' banner. ...  'Chinese 
Taipei' is a meaningless moniker.  Taiwan is a sovereign state with 
its own government, elections, currency and territory.  Taiwan 
negotiates its own treaties and has its own president. ...  It is 
unfair to force the nation's 399 athletes - the fourth-largest Asian 
Games delegation after China, Japan and South Korea - to compete 
under such a meaningless name when they work just as hard as their 
counterparts from other countries. 
 
"It is disheartening to see the oblivious response of the 
international community to the obvious unfairness of this situation, 
especially when it has arisen just to placate the nation's lunatic 
neighbor across the Taiwan Strait.  It is even more frustrating to 
witness the government's utter failure to make progress on this 
issue, even though it has spent a fortune on public relations firms 
and commercials to back the nation's bids to participate in the UN 
and the WHO.  The bottom line is that the DPP has done very little 
to highlight the nation's plight on an international stage such as 
that provided by the Asian Games, in effect choosing to lamely 
accept the ridiculous convention of 'Chinese Taipei.' ..."
