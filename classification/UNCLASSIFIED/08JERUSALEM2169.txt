Main Stories:

Al Quds' front page reports that Secretary Rice called Palestinian 
Authority (PA) President Abbas in Qatar on November 29 to discuss 
the Middle East peace process.  The paper quotes Abbas spokesman 
Nabil Abu Rudaynah telling press that Rice promised Abbas to pass 
the peace negotiations file on to the Obama administration.  A 
second front page article in Al Quds runs November 26 statements by 
Rice about the Arab peace initiative, noting that it provides a 
framework for peace, not only between Israel and the Palestinians, 
but also for a comprehensive, regional peace. Rice also revealed 
that discussions are underway about implementing the Arab peace 
initiative.  Rice noted that PA President Abbas and Israeli Premier 
Olmert continue holding their meetings to bridge gaps on final 
agreement issues.  The paper also adds that Olmert has decided to 
release 250 Palestinian prisoners, while the Palestinians are "very 
positively" working on training and deploying security forces.  Both 
sides are working hard to achieve Annapolis goals, the paper 
concludes. 
 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam lead with the wounding of three Palestinian 
militants on November 29 in eastern Gaza by an Israeli mortar.  The 
men were wounded as they attempted to detonate a roadside bomb. Al 
Quds adds that the Israeli navy opened fire at Palestinian fishing 
boats near Gaza and that the electricity plant has shut down after 
running out of fuel.  Al Ayyam reports that Israel has decided to 
continue the closure of Gaza crossings and that the Israeli Minister 
of Transportation has called for attacking Hamas and key 
infrastructure in Gaza. 
In other front page stories, Al Ayyam cites DPA when quoting an 
Israeli security official stating that Hamas-fired projectiles are 
becoming more lethal and more accurate.  The paper also cites AFP in 
quoting an Egyptian security official revealing that the Egyptian 
police uncovered on November 29, hidden arms and explosives in the 
Sinai, "apparently meant to be smuggled into Gaza." 
Citing the Israeli daily Haaretz, Al Hayat Al Jadida leads with, and 
others front page, the Israeli decision to release 250 Palestinian 
prisoners in the coming days; including most Hamas-affiliated 
prisoners detained in 2006, including legislators and former 
ministers.  Except for Al Quds, the other papers report that the 
prisoner release is not linked to the Shalit prisoner exchange deal 
with Hamas.  Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page adds that Israeli 
Premier Olmert is pressuring his cabinet to approve a prisoner 
exchange deal with Hamas to secure the release of kidnapped soldier 
Shalit before Israeli elections. 
Al Quds' front page reports that a Libyan ship carrying humanitarian 
assistance is expected to arrive in Gaza on December 1, while a 
Turkish boat will soon set sail for Gaza.  Al Hayat Al Jadida's 
front page cites Israel's daily Ma'ariv when quoting Israeli 
security officials stating that Israel will intercept and block the 
Libyan ship from entering Gaza. 
In another front page story, Al Quds reports that Hamas militants 
continued for the second day to block and attack Muslim pilgrims 
attempting to leave the Gaza Strip for travel to Saudi Arabia.  The 
Palestinian Authority, not Hamas, processed their pilgrimage 
registration and visas, the paper notes.  The paper also reports 
that Hamas militants attacked and killed a poultry shopkeeper in 
Gaza - onlookers responded by attacking Hamas militants with stones 
and shoes.  Al Quds' front page further reports that Hamas plans to 
hold a meeting with Palestinian factions to discuss extending the 
truce with Israel. 
Al Quds' front page reports on an Israeli order to have Israeli 
authorities question Palestinian Authority President Bureau Chief 
 
JERUSALEM 00002169  002 OF 003 
 
 
Dr. Rafiq Hussayni after he conducted a tour for Arab ambassadors to 
the Palestinian Territories of Jerusalem areas that are threatened 
by Israeli settlement activities and property confiscation. 
Al Ayyam's inside page reports that Palestinian Authority (PA) Jenin 
security chief Rady Asida confirmed that his forces on November 29, 
foiled a terrorist attack by Israeli settlers on Jenin.  Settlers 
riding in two vehicles attempted to attack civilians in Jenin 
markets, but were forced to leave after PA police arrived on the 
scene.  The PA contacted the the Isreali Defense Forces who arrested 
the settlers after, "a long PA police chase," near Jenin. 
On an inside page, Al Quds cites Reuters in reporting that 
President-elect Obama is expected to reveal his national security 
team on December 1.  Obama will appoint Hillary Clinton as Secretary 
of State and keep Secretary of Defense Robert Gates at the Pentagon, 
according to the report. 
In another inside page report, Al Quds reports on violations against 
Palestinian journalists by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Hamas 
in Gaza and the West Bank. The paper cites the Gaza-based Al Mizan 
human rights organization, saying that violations have become so bad 
that the Ramattan news agency has announced closing its offices in 
Gaza and Ramallah, due to arrests and harassment of journalists. 
Ramattan also faulted the PA President's office for preventing its 
journalists from covering events at the compound.  The report quotes 
a journalist narrating how he was attacked by Hamas militants in 
Gaza.

Weekend stories 
--------------- 
Sunday, November 30 
All dailies reported that Israeli Deputy Defense Minister announced 
on November 29 that Israel is rapidly nearing a wide-scale military 
operation in the Gaza Strip.  Meanwhile Gilad Arden, a Likud Knesset 
Member, proposed using Hamas and Islamic Jihad affiliated prisoners 
as human shields to protect Israeli targets from rockets being 
launched from Gaza Strip. 
"President Abbas states, 'The situation in Gaza is an unprecedented 
humanitarian disaster'" according to Al Ayyam's and Al Hayat Al 
Jadida's front pages.  Speaking in Doha, Abbas added that the 
international community should not accept nor remain silent about 
the "siege" on Gaza which might,"lead to the end of the peace 
process and a return to violence and chaos throughout the region." 
 
Saturday, November 29 
 
All dailies reported that eight Israeli soldiers were wounded on 
November 28, after mortars fired by Gaza Strip militants hit a 
military base near Kibbutz Nahal Oz in the western Negev. 
Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Salah Adin 
Brigades, the armed wing of the Palestinian Popular Resistance 
Committees, according to reporting. 
All front pages reported that Lebanon has decided to establish 
diplomatic relations with the State of Palestine and that the 
Palestinian Authority (PA) will open an embassy to replace the 
office of the PLO that currently exists in Beirut.  PA President 
Abbas called Lebanese President Sulayman and the Lebanese Prime 
Minister to thank them for the decision. 
Al Quds' front page highlighted the November 29 International Day 
for solidarity with the Palestinian people, which also commemorates 
the issuing of UN Resolution 181 on the partition of Palestine into 
two states (Palestinian and Jewish) that allowed for the 
establishment of the State of Israel.  The paper added that the 
Palestinian state has yet to be established, "due to the Israeli 
occupation."

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
1)  Al Quds' editorial is titled, "In order to show authentic 
goodwill"(12/01):  "The Israeli decision to release 250 Palestinian 
prisoners in a so-called 'goodwill gesture'... However, keeping one 
and a half million Palestinians hostages under the Israeli siege 
amidst hunger, darkness and sickness, along with the Israeli West 
Bank policies of settlement activities, military roadblocks, 
restricting movement, segregating Jerusalem, shows the real face of 
Israeli policy.  It indicates no goodwill, but rather leads to an 
escalation of tensions.  It would be better for the Israeli 
Government to reconsider all its policy so that we can start 
believing that there is authentic goodwill towards the Palestinian 
people." 
 
2)   Mustafa Barghouthi, Secretary General for the Palestinian 
National Initiative opines in Al Hayat Al Jadida under the title, 
"Obama, [the Palestinians] and who is taking the initiative?" 
(12/01): "At a time when many people are busy predicting and 
analyzing what the Obama Middle East policy will look like, the 
stereotype of Arab policy waiting along the sidelines holds true... 
So far not there is not a single indication to suggest that [Obama's 
policies will differ from previous ones]... and the early 
appointments of the new [US] administration do not give us much 
optimism for a new approach."
