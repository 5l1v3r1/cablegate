REF:  A) Berlin 1115, B) Berlin 1111 and previous. 
 
¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of confirmed H1N1 infections in 
Germany rose by 147 cases to 17,937 on September 11.  Munich 
International School, which includes Mission children, has 
reported two cases of H1N1.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U)  At its September 11 press briefing, the National 
Reference Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute 
(RKI) confirmed a total of 147 new (laboratory and non- 
laboratory) H1N1 cases in Germany over yesterday, increasing 
the total number of H1N1 cases to 17,937.  New cases were 
distributed among fourteen federal states as follows: North 
Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) (39), Baden-Wuerttemberg (18), Lower- 
Saxony (13), Hamburg (11), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (10), 
Schleswig-Holstein (10), Hesse (16), Brandenburg (7), Berlin 
(6), Thuringia (5), Saxony-Anhalt (5), Rhineland-Palatinate 
(3Bremen (2), and Saarland (2). 
 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, 77 of the total 147 new cases are 
attributed to people returning from travel abroad.  New cases 
include non-laboratory H1N1 cases that exhibited symptoms 
after being in contact with a laboratory-confirmed infected 
person. 
 
¶4. (U)  NRW remains the German state with the highest number 
of confirmed virus cases with a total of 5,468, followed by 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (2,750 cases) and Lower-Saxony (2,585). 
The number of all confirmed infections in Germany that have 
resulted from domestic transmission is 27 percent. 
 
 
Munich International School reports two cases of H1N1 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶5. (U)  According to information from the school nurse at the 
Munich International School (MIS), the confirmed H1N1 
infections reported in REF B involve a 12 grader who returned 
from a school trip in Spain.  Another student from the same 
class also developed flu-like symptoms.  Both cases were 
confirmed on September 9.  Both students reportedly went to 
their doctors after the excursion and did not attend school, 
eliminating further contact with other students.  They are 
reportedly quarantined at home and will return to school once 
doctors give their approval.  There were no additional cases 
of H1N1 reported at MIS yesterday or today.  Public health 
authorities advised against closing the school.  The federal 
state of Bavaria is the state with the fourth highest 
incidence of the new flu, following NRW, Baden-Wuerttemberg 
and Lower-Saxony.
