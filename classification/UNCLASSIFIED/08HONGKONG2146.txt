1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) attempted 
to conduct a post shipment-verification (PSV) at CAM IC 
International limited, Rm. 1405 Chung Kiu Commercial Building, 47-51 
Shantung Street, Hong Kong (CAM-IC). The items in question are 200 
REI exported to CAM IC on or about April 5, 2008 and valued at USD 
38,000.  On the applicable shippers export declaration (SED), these 
items are classified under export control classification number 
(ECCN) 3A001 and, if properly classified, would be controlled for 
national security (NS) reasons.  These appear to be items that may 
be shipped license-free to Hong Kong but would, in virtually all 
circumstances, require a license for shipment to mainland China. The 
exporter was Rochester Electronics of Newburyport, Massachusetts. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, CAM IC does not 
exist as a registered company in Hong Kong.  A domain search of the 
company's apparent web site (www.cam-ic.com) reveals that the domain 
name was registered by CAM IC International Limited, room 2006, 20F, 
Saige Square, Futian District, Shenzhen with a contact name listed 
as Arthur Chen and telephone number +86075583775474.  The web site 
is merely a compilation of text and graphics taken from other web 
sites including the web site of CM Computer (www.cmcomputer.com), 
which states that it is a leader in military VMEBus, I/O and ATR 
Chassis. 
 
¶4.  As detailed further in reftel B and below, CAM IC appears to be 
related to Winsuny Tech HK Ltd., the subject of a previous 
unfavorable EUC.  During that related PSV, a Winsuny representative 
claimed that the items shipped to Winsuny from Rochester that were 
the subject of that EUC were destined for CAM IC.  As further 
detailed in reftel B, that claim was almost certainly false. ECO 
notes that the director of Winsuny is listed as Chen, Long.  ECO 
assumes this is the same Mr. Chen as CAM IC's Arthur Chen (listed as 
the domain holder contact name for CAM IC). 
 
¶5.  A review of the transaction documents for this shipment provided 
by OEA, CAM IC's ship-to address is the same address as Winsuny. 
That transaction documentation also lists a bill-to name as Techwing 
Elec Ltd., also at the same address.  The Hong Kong Companies 
Registry does not include a listing for Techwing.  The phone number 
included in the transaction documents is not operational.  An 
additional ship-to address in the Rochester transaction 
documentation provided by OEA, namely Units 1-3, 7th Floor, Shing 
Yip Building, 19-21 Shing Yip Street, Kowloon, corresponds to the 
address of Aurora Business Centre, a corporate registration and 
hosting company (www.abizctr.com). 
 
¶6.  Based on the information noted above, ECO believes that CAM IC 
is an unsuitable recipient of U.S. origin controlled technology. 
ECO recommends that BIS reach out to Rochester to determine what 
information it had on hand when it shipped the items.  Further, ECO 
requests that OEA confirm the 3A001 classification of the shipment 
so that ECO may reach out to Hong Kong TID concerning a potential 
violation of Hong Kong's export control rules in connection with 
this shipment.  Finally, ECO recommends that CAM IC be added to the 
BIS Unverified List and/or Entities List.
