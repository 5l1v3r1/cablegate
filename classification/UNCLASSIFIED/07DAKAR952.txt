FUND FOR REFUGEES

SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  Embassy Dakar is pleased to submit three proposals to aid 
organizations that provide critical assistance to refugees in 
Senegal.  Each of the three USD 20,000 proposals focuses on 
the conflict-ridden Casamance region.  The proposals consist 
of continuing a project to increase awareness of the peace 
process using community radios, assisting landmine victims 
and protecting refugee orphans.  END SUMMARY. 
 
PROPOSAL ONE: WORLD EDUCATION/ZINGUICHOR-KOLDA 
--------------------------------------------- - 
¶2.  World Education is requesting funds to continue its 
FY-2006 Ambassador's Fund for Refugees project operating the 
community radio stations it created.  The stations broadcast 
peace messages in local languages.  In concert with rural 
communities in the Zinguichor region, programming promotes 
good governance and tolerance and encourages finding a final 
and durable peace.  Due to high illiteracy rates and a lack 
of electricity in many rural villages, community radio has 
become the main medium by which important information can 
reach local communities in a region that has not seen peace 
since 1982.  Community radios are vital tools in trying to 
help populations overcome ethnic beliefs and lead to behavior 
change.  Cost: USD 20,000. 
 
PROJECT TWO: HANDICAP INTERNATIONAL-ZINGUICHOR 
--------------------------------------------- - 
¶3.  Handicap International (HI), a French non-governmental 
organization (NGO) focused on assisting handicapped people in 
particular, has worked in Senegal since 1996 with a national 
program to intervene in medical and economic insertion of 
landmines victims.  HI seeks funds to improve the living 
conditions of landmine victims through socio-economic 
activities such as keeping handicapped children in schools, 
creating income generating activities, providing medical 
health care, and making orthopedic apparel.  Most girls are 
given training in areas such as sewing and cooking, while men 
and women are involved in fruit and vegetable food processing 
programs.  Cost: USD 20,000. 
 
PROJECT THREE: POUPONNIERE &VIVRE ENSEMBLE-ADSAHEL8 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
¶4.  The Mbour pouponniere (baby shelter) was created in 2002 
and aids babies who are orphans from birth or the children of 
mentally ill mothers.  As of writing there are 73 babies in 
the shelter.  Most babies are from the Casamance region, and 
their mothers were either killed or raped.  The NGO requests 
funding to provide the shelter with medical equipment, food 
and medicine, as well as to construct additional facilities 
to host single mothers and women who are having difficult 
pregnancies.  Cost: USD 20,000.
