frustrating that rather than recognize her accomplishments, 
Parliament had voted her down due based on the ethnic composition of 
the proposed cabinet.  She urged the U.S. to continue supporting the 
Ministry. 
 
¶8.  Ambassador Wayne noted that the day's event would mark an 
expansion of U.S. support for MOWA, specifically for the Legal 
Rights Division.  INL's Justice Sector Support Program would hand 
over office and training equipment (valued at $40,000 USD) to help 
the office run more efficiently, as well as recognize the efforts of 
an Afghan (national) Legal Consultant who the INL/JSSP program had 
placed at the Legal Rights Division two months earlier.  Ghazanfar 
expressed appreciation for the support for the Legal Rights 
Division; she had looked at the equipment being provided and it was 
all sorely needed. 
 
¶9.  Immediately following this meeting, Minister Ghazanfar and 
Ambassador Wayne presided over a handover ceremony for the equipment 
being provided to the Legal Rights Division.  Ghazanfar expressed 
her thanks for the United States' continued support for the 
Ministry.  She praised the efforts of INL/JSSP mentor Gullalai 
Karimi, noting that mentors made a huge difference at the Ministry 
and the Ministry would welcome even more.  The equipment being 
provided to the Legal Rights Division (all arrayed behind Ghazanfar 
and Wayne) were "not just boxes" but important tools that would help 
bring real change to the women of Afghanistan.  Ambassador Wayne 
commended the hard work of the 14 employees of the Ministry's Legal 
Rights Division, which for many women was their first point of 
contact with the Ministry.  The $40,000 worth of equipment donated 
included computers to keep records, video cameras for training, 
office furniture, and other supplies and equipment like printers, a 
copy machine, and paper.  This followed seven million that the U.S. 
had already given MOWA, and reflected that we continued to support 
the Ministry and look for ways to help it perform its vital 
mission. 
 
¶10.  The handover event was subsequently reported on several Afghan 
television and radio news programs.
