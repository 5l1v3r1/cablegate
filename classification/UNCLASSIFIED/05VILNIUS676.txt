Minister of Defense Gediminas Kirkilas told the Ambassador on 
June 22 that Parliament granted the GOL statutory authority 
for international troop deployments through December 31, 2007 
in a resolution it passed on June 9 (ref A).  Our previous 
understanding based on conversations with other GOL officials 
was that this legislation covered only operations through 
December 31, 2006 (ref B).  We confirmed that the resolution 
indeed authorizes the GOL to deploy up to 420 troops for 
missions in the Balkans, Central and Southern Asia, and the 
Persian Gulf -- including Iraq and Afghanistan -- beginning 
January 1, 2006 through the end of 2007. 
 
Begin translation of Parliament Resolution: 
 
"The Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania decrees:  The 
sending of Lithuanian military units, composed of troops and 
attached civil servants, to participate in international 
operations in the regions of the Balkans, Central and South 
Asia and the Persian Gulf is established at a maximum size of 
up to 350 soldiers and attached civil servants until December 
31, 2005, and up to 420 soldiers and attached civil servants 
from January 1, 2006 until December 31, 2007."
