In Today's Papers 
 
33 Nationalists Detained for Weapons, Assassination Plots 
All papers give extensive front page coverage to the operations 
carried out yesterday in three provinces to capture members of an 
illegal organization code-named "Ergenekon." The operations began 
with the discovery of army grenades eight months ago in a house in 
the Umraniye district of Istanbul.   Mainstream Sabah reports that 
the offices of the nationalist associations 'Kuvayi Milliye' and 
'Mudafaai Hukuk' were raided during the operations.  Retired General 
Veli Kucuk, journalist Guler Komurcu, ultra-nationalist lawyer Kemal 
Kerincsiz and retired Colonel Fikri Karadag are among the 33 people 
taken into custody.  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak notes that the 
operation was a turning point in the fight against illegal networks. 
 Sabah and Hurriyet report that the Istanbul chief prosecutor 
reminded the media that press reports related to the issue have been 
suspended.  Following this decision, no further details about the 
accusations against the suspects were released.  Papers also report 
that two days ago Istanbul police Chief Celalettin Cerrah met with 
PM Erdogan in Ankara.  They further speculate that after the 
meeting, Erdogan authorized the operations.   Sabah says that the 
Ergenekon network was linked to a number of big attacks, including 
the murder of Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, three bomb attacks 
against Cumhuriyet daily, the murder of an Italian priest in Trabzon 
and the Danistay killings. 
 
PM Erdogan and US Ambassador Wilson Discussed Terror 
Sabah reports that PM Erdogan and Ambassador Wilson met late on 
Monday night to discuss the fight against terror.  Reports say the 
Ambassador requested an appointment from the PM before going to the 
US for a high-level defense group meeting and that the PM had to 
cancel an AKP administrative meeting in order to see the Ambassador. 
 Yesterday, Erdogan told journalists that terror was discussed at 
the meeting.  Ambassador Wilson told the Anatolian News Agency 
yesterday that he wanted to hear the Prime Minister's opinion on 
bilateral issues before going to the US next week. 
 
Davos Survey 
All papers report that a survey prepared for the Davos World 
Economic Forum meetings concluded Turks are more pessimistic than 
Iranians regarding the Muslim-West dialogue, and that 13% of Turks 
support al Qaeda.  Mainstream Hurriyet reports that "according to a 
global poll conducted before Davos, the Islamic World and the West 
do not understand each other."  Yeni Safak says that PM Erdogan will 
not attend the Davos World Economic Forum because the summit is 
taking place in the shadow of crisis as Muslims are not being shown 
respect.  Other papers report that, according to statements made by 
the PM's office, Erdogan cancelled his plans to attend Davos due to 
a number of important internal developments and a heavy schedule. 
 
 
 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: Turkish Foreign Policy 
 
"The Derailing of Turkish Foreign Policy" 
Cengiz Candar commented in business and political daily Referans 
(1/23):  "It was comforting and nice to hear when President Gul 
declared 2008 as 'the EU year for Turkey.'  However, we should look 
at the deeds following the words.  In that regard, Turkish foreign 
policy, at least so far this year, is far from focused on EU goals. 
It appears that 2008 is destined to be anything but the EU year. 
President Gul went to the US, but right after that he rushed to 
Syria and Egypt.  In Syria, he stood side by side with former 
Lebanese president Lahoud, whom he called "the Syrian puppet" and 
who has been linked to the assassination of Hariri.  Shortly after 
that visit, the Presidential Palace was opened for the Sudanese 
president, who is known as a military dictator and a champion of 
Islamist Sharia law.  He is also accused of genocide.  How can 
Turkey make 2008 a year of the EU under such foreign policy

preferences?  Given the current vision, it is almost impossible to 
expect any step for democratization and freedom of expression. 
Evidently Turkish foreign policy has been derailed." 
 
"Sharing Intelligence with Israel!" 
Hakan Albayrak argued in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak (1/23):  "It 
is very interesting to see that the Turkish leaders, including 
President Gul, exert every effort at international forums to defend 
the rights of Palestinian people.  Given its power and influence, 
Turkey should be able to act in a more robust manner on this issue, 
even at the Annapolis Conference.   At the very least, Turkey should 
cancel the defense cooperation agreement with Israel.  Meanwhile, 
wire services report that Israeli Defense Minister Barak will visit 
Turkey at the invitation of Turkey's Defense Minister Gonul. 
Reports say that Barak, who has been called the 'Minister for 
Attacks,' and Gonul will discuss bilateral cooperation and regional 
security.  I cannot help but ask some questions to the AKP 
government as well as the Turkish General Staff.  Israel represents 
an evil regime which holds the primary responsibility for the 
insecurity in this region.  What are we going to talk with them 
about?  Defense cooperation with Israel reverberates as something 
shameful.  How long should we bare this shame?  There is also talk 
about sharing intelligence with Israel.  What is that supposed to 
mean?  If Israel provides intelligence about the PKK, what are we 
going to provide in return?  Are we going to inform against Hamas or 
Lebanese Hizbullah?  There is no rationale for Turkey to become so 
involved with Israel."
