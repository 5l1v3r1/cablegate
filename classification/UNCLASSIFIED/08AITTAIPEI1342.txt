¶1. COMMERCIAL OFFICER ERIC CROWLEY, FN FRANCES LI, AND EXBS ADVISOR 
MI-YONG KIM OF THE ECONOMIC SECTION VISITED THE CHUNG SHAN INSTITUTE 
OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (CSIST) AT THE ADDRESS GIVEN AND MET WITH 
BOR-RONG SONG, DIRECTOR OF THE PROCUREMENT AND CONSTRUCTION SERVICE 
DIVISION AND WITH CHAN-ZHENG YANG, PROJECT DIRECTOR, TO CONDUCT A 
POST-SHIPMENT VERIFICATION ON AUGUST 15, 2008. 
 
¶2. THE CSIST, ESTABLISHED IN 1968, IS THE PRIMARY RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE OF THE MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE (MND). 
THE CSIST IS ADMINISTERED UNDER THE ARMAMENTS BUREAU OF THE MND AND 
IS DIVIDED INTO SIX RESEARCH DIVISIONS AND FOUR CENTERS. 
 
¶3. BECAUSE CSIST HANDLES MUCH OF TAIWAN'S SENSITIVE MILITARY 
RESEARCH, GAINING ACCESS TO THE SITE HAS BEEN CUMBERSOME AND TOOK 
ABOUT THREE MONTHS TO COMPLETE THEIR REQUIRED SECURITY CHECK.  ONCE 
CS STAFF WERE GRANTED SECURITY CLEARANCE, CSIST WAS OPEN AND 
COOPERATIVE.  CS TAIPEI EXPECTS A SMOOTHER AND FASTER PROCESS IN THE 
FUTURE. 
 
¶4. CSIST SAID THAT THEY WERE NOTIFIED BY THE US FIRM'S LOCAL 
IMPORTER THAT THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION WAS A CONTROLLED ITEM AND THAT 
THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE RESTRICTIONS RELATED TO THE HANDLING OF 
SUCH CONTROLLED TECHNOLOGY.  CSIST SAID THAT THEY ARE USING 
CONTROLLED ITEM, A 2 MHZ TO 5 MHZ SPECTRUM ANALYZER, FOR RADIO 
FREQUENCY MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS.  CS TAIWAN STAFF PHYSICALLY 
INSPECTED THE CONTROLLED ITEM.  HOWEVER, WHEN COMPARING THE MODEL 
AND SERIAL NUMBERS AND ECCN NUMBER BETWEEN THE REF CABLE AND 
SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS, CS TAIWAN FOUND THE FOLLOWING DISCREPANCY: 
 
REF CABLE 
-- MODEL NUMBERS: MS2036A2640 
 
SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS 
-- MODEL NUMBERS: MS2036A 
 
¶5. BASED ON CS TAIWAN'S SITE VISIT, CSIST APPEARS TO BE A BONA FIDE 
AND REPUTABLE ORGANIZATION IN TAIWAN.  CS TAIWAN'S VISIT DISCLOSED 
NO ADVERSE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION OR ITS SUITABILITY TO 
RECEIVE SENSITIVE U.S. PRODUCTS.
