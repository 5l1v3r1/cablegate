¶4. Lodging: As requested, no rooms have been reserved for this 
transit. 
 
¶5. Following is post's standard guidance for visitors to Kuwait: 
 
   a. Entry Requirements: Kuwait now issues single-entry visas to 
American citizens on arrival, upon presentation of a valid passport. 
 There is a processing fee of three (3) Kuwaiti Dinar (KD 3.000, or 
USD 12.00) for each visa issued. The fee may be paid either in KD or 
USD.  Post strongly advises travelers to carry some documentation 
concerning the purpose of their visit.  Passengers arriving on U.S. 
military flights should anticipate extra delays because immigration 
services are not available on the military side of the airfield and 
passports have to be carried to a different location at the airport 
for processing.  Please allow four hours for passport processing 
when arriving by milair.  Airport visas are valid for 90 days after 
arrival; anyone staying beyond this period must obtain an extension, 
which should be requested 2 weeks prior to visa expiration.  Anyone 
departing Kuwait who has overstayed the visa will be charged a fine 
of KD 10.000 (US 36.00) per day at the airport.  All travelers 
planning to visit Iraq should make sure that they obtain the 
required exit/entry stamps for each transit through Kuwait, and be 
aware that they will need to obtain a new Kuwaiti visa upon return, 
even after a daytrip to Baghdad.  Failure to do so can result in 
heavy fines.  If possible, travelers should try to obtain a 
multiple-entry visa before arriving in Kuwait. 
 
   b. Visitors are reminded that the importation of alcohol, pork 
products, personal firearms, and any suggestive/pornographic 
materials (videotapes, magazines or books) is strictly prohibited by 
Kuwaiti law.  Visitors are strictly enjoined from bringing in any 
such items, even in checked luggage or carry-on baggage, as the 
consequences can be severe.  Kuwait is still clearing mines and 
munitions. Visitors must remain on major paved roads when traveling 
in Kuwait.  Travel north of Jahra toward the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border is 
not authorized without approval from the embassy and an appropriate 
escort. 
 
   c. Embassy Kuwait's normal workweek is Sunday through Thursday, 
and office hours are from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The time difference 
with the East Coast of the United States is EDT plus seven hours. 
The embassy switchboard number is (965) 259-1001, and the IVG number 
is 4950000. The after-hours number, that rings at Marine Guard Post 
One, is (965) 538-2098.  The mission duty officer can be reached 
through the embassy switchboard, Post One or by cell phone at (965) 
967-7265.  The embassy pouch address is 6200 Kuwait Place, Dulles, 
VA 20189-6200. 
 
   d. Threat Assessment:  Kuwait is a high-threat post and the 
military threatcon is currently Charlie.  We have increased security 
precautions at official U.S. installations in Kuwait and recommend 
that all Americans in Kuwait remain alert to their surroundings and 
review their personal security practices. 
 
   e. Health Advisory for Kuwait:  April through October is the hot 
season in Kuwait.  Temperatures reach 120-140 degrees F in summer. 
Caution should be taken to prevent dehydration and heat exhaustion 
by 1) drinking plenty of fluids and 2) staying indoors, especially 
during peak temperature hours of noon to 4:00 PM.  Low humidity 
coupled with high temperatures creates excessive moisture loss from 
evaporation.  It is necessary to drink 2-4 quarts of water daily to 
prevent dehydration. 
 
 
   f. Money:  Credit cards are widely accepted at hotels, 
restaurants and other establishments throughout Kuwait and ATM 
machines are also readily available.  For travelers on official 
orders, the Commercial Bank of Kuwait can provide accommodation 
services (cashing a personal check drawn on a U.S. bank into local 
currency) up to a maximum of USD 300.00 per day from noon to 2:00 
p.m., Saturday through Wednesday.  At the current rate of exchange, 
one Kuwaiti Dinar (KD) is equivalent to approximately USD 3.60. 
 
   g. CAA Access:  Visitors who need unescorted access into secure 
areas of the mission must slug cables to the attention of the RSO, 
and include the level of their clearance.  The cable should include 
the visitor's Social Security number, and the name of the agency 
granting the clearance.  Cables should include the ASEC tag to 
ensure distribution to the RSO office and the Marine Security guard 
at Post One. 
 
   h. Computer and Electronics Usage:  Sensitive military 
information has been discovered recently on business center 
computers at local hotels in Kuwait City.  All U.S. government 
personnel and contractors must remember that it is their 
responsibility to observe good computer and information security 
practices.  Information processed on computers in hotel business 
centers, through email correspondence or document creation, is 
highly exploitable.  Public computers located in hotel business 
centers, internet cafes, airport lounges, etc. should never be used 
to process, store or disseminate sensitive information.  Compromise 
of sensitive government or military information can result in 
serious damage to national security.  Compromises of sensitive 
personal data can result in significant personal and financial 
hardship.  Random checks are conducted by Embassy personnel on 
public PC's.  Breaches on COMPUSEC will result in the violator 
receiving security infractions and/or security violations. 
Interagency security standards prohibit the introduction or use of 
non-USG owned computer hardware and software at all USG diplomatic 
facilities.  Cell phones, palm pilots, radios and other convenience 
electronics are prohibited in all secure areas of the mission. 
 
   i. Photography:  Tourist photography is encouraged in Kuwait. 
However, it is strictly forbidden to photograph public buildings, 
economic infrastructure (e.g., oil facilities), or military and 
other security-related facilities and personnel.  Confiscation of 
film and camera and even arrest may result from doing so.  A good 
rule of thumb:  If there is any doubt as to whether a photograph 
should be taken, don't take it. 
 
   j. Action Request:  Each visitor, regardless of length of stay, 
must bring or forward fiscal data to pay for direct costs of the 
visit.  Each agency, organization or visiting delegation will be 
charged for the actual costs attributed to their visit.  Direct 
charge costs include, but are not limited to:  American and LES 
staff overtime (e.g., expeditor, accommodation exchange, 
representational event support), field travel, lodging and meals and 
incidental expenses (M&IE) by embassy employees, vehicle rentals, 
long-distance telephone calls, equipment rentals, office supplies 
and all other costs that are directly attributable to the visit.  If 
fiscal data on a traveler's authorization is to be used for this 
purpose, this information must be spelled out in the travel orders 
and sufficient funding provided to meet these expenses.  In 
addition, for TDYers over thirty (30) days, there will be a charge 
for ICASS support services.  If your sponsoring agency is not signed 
up for ICASS services at post, please be prepared to sign an ICASS 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for ICASS support services upon 
arrival.  The agency should provide post with written communication, 
generated by the traveler's headquarters, that confirms the agency 
will pay ICASS charges for the TDYer, provide the agency ICASS 
billing code for the TDY support to be provided, and authorize the 
traveler to sign the ICASS invoice generated by the TDY module. 
When travel is urgent, TDYers should bring this document with them 
to ensure there are no interruptions in the provision of services. 
Post will not provide any services to a TDYer staying in excess of 
30 days without having received this documentation prior to day 31 
of the TDY. 
 
¶6. This is revision one to the Embassy's standard country clearance 
cable.
