In Today's Papers 
 
Erdogan Announces New Turkish Cabinet 
All papers report Thursday and today Prime Minister Erdogan 
submitted the new cabinet list to President Abdullah Gul.  "I 
prepared the new cabinet as a team with the skills to realize our 
goals for the coming period.  I believe that we formed a strong 
team," Erdogan said after Gul approved the list of 25 ministers. 
 
The new cabinet includes eight new ministers, with six members of 
the former cabinet excluded.  Nimet Cubukcu is again the only woman 
in the cabinet.  Former Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc was denied a 
seat in the cabinet, but is expected to be given a key position in 
party administration.  New Interior Minister Besir Atalay, a figure 
known to be close to President Gul, had been vetoed by former 
President Sezer as Education Minister.  Economy matters will be 
coordinated by Deputy Prime Minister Nazim Ekren, who was the 
"shadow economy minister" in the previous government with his 
expertise in banking and monetary issues.  State Minister Mehmet 
Simsek, formerly a specialist at Merrill Lynch, will be in charge of 
the Treasury Undersecretariat.  Gul is expected to continue to be 
active in foreign affairs, and many observers expect him to 
overshadow the "young and inexperienced" new Foreign Minister Ali 
Babacan on the international stage. 
 
Papers report the new cabinet was welcomed by Turkish business and 
industry circles.  The government program will be read out in the 
Parliament on Friday and a vote of confidence is to take place 
September 5. 
 
Ice Melting between Gul and Military 
All papers report after the military's top brass snubbed Abdullah 
Gul's swearing-in ceremony in parliament on Tuesday, and on 
Wednesday gave him a chilly reception at a military graduation 
ceremony in Ankara, the strains between the military and the 
president ended at Victory Day celebrations in Ankara on Friday. 
During the ceremonies General Buyukanit held warm talks with Gul and 
Erdogan, and at the end of a military-hosted reception in the 
evening, both politicians were seen off by Buyukanit himself. 
 
Pentagon Probes US Weapons in Hands of the PKK 
All papers report the Pentagon "admits" that US weapons sent to Iraq 
went into the hands of PKK terrorists.  Papers report Pentagon 
spokesman Geoff Morrell as saying Wednesday that the department's 
inspector general, retired General Claude Kicklighter, will go to 
Iraq next week to investigate the matter.  Morrell said the 
investigation into US weapons in Turkey was sparked in May when 
Pentagon officials learned that the Turks were concerned about 
American-issued weapons being involved in crimes in their country. 
Papers also report that Morrell said, "If American-issued weapons 
have ended up in the hands of terrorists in Turkey that is not based 
on the policy of this department or this government". 
 
DTP Claims Turks Use Chemical Weapons against the PKK 
All papers report in a message on the occasion of August 30 Victory 
Day, Turkey's main Kurdish party DTP accused the Turkish military of 
using chemical weapons in security operations against the PKK.  The 
DTP message noted the fact that the bodies of 11 PKK members killed 
in Uludere in the province of Sirnak have not been handed over to 
their families strengthens the claim chemical weapons were used in 
the operation.  Papers report that General Buyukanit denied the 
claims calling them "lies." 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkey-EU 
Erdal Safak commented in the mainstream Sabah (8/31):  "The EU's 
month-long holiday is ending today.  EU Commission officials will 
have a lot to do, especially the Turkey desk officials.  Those 
bureaucrats will evaluate Turkey's progress on reforms in the past 
year but, unfortunately, there has been no progress on Turkey's EU 
reforms worth mentioning.  No steps have been taken on the EU's

priority issues, such as changes in Turkish Penal Code Article 301, 
the article under which writers and journalists have been prosecuted 
for "insulting Turkishness;" Cyprus; Halki Seminary;  and the 
Foreign Foundations laws.  We are still hopeful that the reform 
calendar will be announced in the new Government's activity program. 
A few visits to some EU countries and especially one to Brussels by 
President Gul, might help raise Turkey's grade on the progress 
report."
