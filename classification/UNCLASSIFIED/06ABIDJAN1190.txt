REF: SECSTATE 152063 
 
 ¶1.  The Economic Section and the Foreign Commercial Section 
at Post jointly monitor trade agreements and respond to 
foreign trade barrier complaints.  The Section's two Economic 
Officers determine responsibilities for specific cases as 
they emerge, working in concert with the regional FCS Officer 
based in Dakar.  Points of contact: Economic Chief Ervin 
Massinga, (225) 22.49.4637, Economic Officer Erfana Dar (225) 
22.49.4602, FCS Officer Cynthia Griffin Greene (221) 
823.4296.  The Economic Section and FCS respond accordingly 
as issues arise, coordinating with other Embassy Sections, 
the Front Office and relevant Washington Agencies.  Post 
monitors ongoing situations closely through regular contact 
with the U.S. companies involved, host government ministries 
and other actors as appropriate. 
 
¶2.  The most noteworthy current example of a foreign trade 
barrier complaint and a violation of trade agreements relates 
to the longstanding dispute between Western Wireless 
International (WWI) Cora de Comstar Cote d'Ivoire subsidiary 
and the Ministry of Communications, along with a private 
Ivorian individual who continues to press spurious legal 
claims and to attempt siezure of Cora property.  Post has 
advocated on behalf of WWI in order to bring the case to 
satisfactory resolution. 
 
¶3.  Post is pleased to report that in 2006 ExxonMobil's 
dispute with French fuel transport company Centaures Routiers 
was finally settled.  Post had advocated on ExxonMobil's 
behalf regularly during the dispute which lasted nearly 20 
years.
