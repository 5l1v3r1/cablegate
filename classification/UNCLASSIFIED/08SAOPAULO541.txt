SUBJECT: GLOBAL ECONOMY; FINANCIAL CRISES 
 
Financial War 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (10/08) says: "The news on 
the financial crisis evokes a scenario of a world war, with several 
fronts spread all over the planet- from Australia to Brazil, from 
China to Russia, from Germany to the United States..., The multiple 
combatants, however, show themselves weak and dysfunctional facing a 
threat that does not respect borders - or even worse, it gains force 
when there is a lack of a coordinated action to attack it. 
Discredit in the financial system is global, but the approaches to 
face it are national, limited and heterogeneous... It would be a 
waste that one of the most powerful tools of the Fed, the reduction 
of short term interests, were used without articulation with other 
countries that are going through the same situation, something that 
already causes despair.  A worldwide and synchronized decrease in 
the cost of loans would increase the chances that the collapse would 
be at least staunched.  At this moment, the news that the crisis had 
reached its limit would already be good news."
