¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  The World Bank is moving ahead with 
a flagship Avian Influenza (AI) package for Turkey that 
should be ready for Executive Board approval by the end 
of March.  A U.S. contribution as part of this package 
could help fill local gaps in a country that remains 
highly vulnerable to new outbreaks, could bolster the 
region's response, and could help leverage other 
assistance.  A U.S. contribution outside the package 
would not have the same impact, either in Turkey or 
regionally.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The World Bank Resrep tells us he plans to 
enter into loan negotiations with the GOT on February 21- 
22 for a $24 million IBRD loan, out of a $44 million AI 
package that includes $13 million in EU grants and 
Turkish public and private sector contributions.  Given 
the 5-6 week time lag between conclusion of negotiations 
and Executive Board approval, this means the package 
would be finalized at the end of March.  Both the World 
Bank and Turkish Government would welcome U.S. Government 
participation in this package, which will be seen as the 
flagship vehicle for the international community efforts. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Turkey has done a relatively good job on AI 
animal and human response during the recent outbreaks 
that lead to the first four human deaths outside Asia. 
But, as the visiting multi-agency team found, the 
response was far from perfect and there are key gaps in 
surveillance and communication (refs).  Both the local 
reps of international organizations and the Turkish 
government see the current lull following the last death 
on January 15, as only a respite.  Outbreaks in animals 
continue, and migratory birds will begin returning to 
Turkey from the south over the coming months.  Although 
culling of backyard fowl is proceeding, Turkey remains 
very exposed to another outbreak. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  We see potential benefits in at least a small 
contribution to the World Bank package: 
 
  --Turkey's geographical location at the crossroads of 
  global bird migrations makes its response critical for 
 
ANKARA 00000630  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
  the region and the world. 
 
  --Turkey can serve as a model and resource for the 
  region.  An example would be developing a regional 
  capacity for laboratory testing for H5N1. 
 
  --Even a modest expenditure would engender many 
  benefits in the U.S. relationship with this key 
  country.  Our absence from a World Bank/EU package 
  would be well noted. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  As discussed with the visiting team, areas 
where USG expertise and support could make a difference 
include supporting additions to human laboratory capacity 
testing in Ankara (raising to Bio-Security Level 3). 
This would create a regional capacity that could support 
the Caucasus, Iraq, and other neighboring countries. 
Other areas in which the impact of U.S. support could be 
felt beyond Turkey include (a) augmenting veterinary 
surveillance training to increase detection capacity for 
handling multiple outbreaks could be important, and (b) 
help in developing communications outreach capability for 
a region of the world that is characterized by high 
illiteracy rates and multiple languages and ethnicities. 
An alternative currently outside the scope of the World 
Bank project - but which could be added - would provide 
catalytic funding and technical assistance to Turkish 
activities aimed at crisis response capacity building 
with neighboring countries.  Ankara might have more 
success than the U.S. or the U.N. agencies in places like 
Azerbaijan, to say nothing of Syria or Iran. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  It appears to us that the World Bank package 
is responsive to Turkey's needs and well coordinated, 
although with some difficulty, with relevant GOT 
agencies.  The USG has played an important role in 
shaping the overall package proposed by the World Bank 
through our substantial interaction and input with IO's 
during two AI visits and in Washington.
