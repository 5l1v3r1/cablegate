Statement by PM Harper on Canada's National Day of 
Remembrance and Action on Violence against Women, 2008 
 
OTTAWA 00001546  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
December 6, 2008 
 
December 6, 1989 was a tragic day in our history.  In what 
came to be known as the Montreal Massacre, 14 bright, 
talented young women were shot and killed in the halls and 
classrooms of their school, l'Ecole Polytechnique de 
Montreal.   The victims of this terrible crime were targeted 
solely because they were women. 
 
This tragedy sent shockwaves of grief and anger across Canada 
and beyond, and the outrage felt by so many fuelled a 
determination by Canadians to work together to end violence 
against women. 
 
With this tragedy etched on our hearts, December 6th is set 
aside each year as Canada's National Day of Remembrance and 
Action on Violence against Women.  It is a reminder that we 
must continue to work to end violence in all its forms. 
 
On this 19th commemoration of that painful day in 1989, I 
urge Canadians to honour the memories of all women who have 
died as a result of  violence, and to do what they can to 
work to end violence in all its forms.
