REF: SECSTATE 160481 
 
¶1.  (U)  Summary.  The Indonesian Air Force (IAF) verified 
their orders of component parts detailed in reftel. The 
foreign consignees are new to the military supply business, 
however they have prior Indonesian government procurement 
experience.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) We contacted Chief of Aeronautics, Air First Marshal 
Sunaryo, to verify order number 05-1005798 AND 05-1007395. 
Sunaryo could not explain the lack of IAF documentation for 
this transaction, however, he did confirm that the IAF had 
placed airplane spare-parts orders with PT. Mandira Jaya 
Abadi and C.V. Bina Pratama for maintenance of their F-5 and 
OV-10 aircraft.  Sunaryo noted that both companies are 
legitimate IAF suppliers, however, it has been a year and 
the companies are waiting for export licenses for the 
transactions detailed in reftel. 
 
¶3.  (U) We also contacted PT Mandira Jaya Abadi Director 
Hariyanto Adipratomo on November 14, and learned that PT. 
Mandira Jaya Abadi and C.V. Bina Pratama are sister 
companies (per incorporation documents). Adipratomo 
represented both companies to verify the orders.  Adipratomo 
confirmed that both companies received orders from the IAF 
to provide spare-parts detailed in reftel for maintenance 
for their OV-10 and F-5 aircrafts.  Both companies contacted 
Master Logistic located in Singapore as their intermediate 
consignee for handling shipment of the goods.  Adipratomo is 
also aware of the restrictions on re-transfer and re-export 
of USML. 
 
¶4.  (U) Adipratomo provided us copies of transaction 
documentation via e-mail.  The documents include: 
 
-- End user statement signed by IAF Chief of Procurement Air 
First Marshal Sridadi dated December 15, 2005 for order 
number 05-1005798;

1005798 AND 05-1007395;

10 aircraft spare-parts with its contract number 
179/1197/DA/DR/2005/AU dated November 30, 2005.  While C.V. 
Bina Pratama recived order from the same end user with its 
contract number 183/1356/DA/DR/2005/AU dated November 30, 
2005 to procure F-5 aircraft spare-parts. 
 
¶5.  PT. Mandira Jaya Abadi was established in 1982. C.V. 
Bina Pratama was established two years later in 1984.  Both 
companies are in Semarang, Central Java in the publishing 
and general supply business. Starting in 2005 and 2006 
Mandira and Bina expanded their business to supply spare- 
parts to Indonesian Air Force for maintenance of aircrafts. 
Reftel components are their first transaction with the IAF. 
Previously, Mandira supplied simulators to the Indonesian 
Ministry of Transportation.
