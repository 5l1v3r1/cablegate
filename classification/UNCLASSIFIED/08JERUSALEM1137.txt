The IDF opened fire on unidentified individuals near the

Palestinian press reported that the IDF opened fire twice on 
shepherds near the border in southern Gaza, shooting one

¶2.  (SBU) Gaza-based NGOs and private sector contacts said 
that the Sufa crossing, the Karni/al-Mintar commercial 
crossing (including the conveyer belt), and the Nahal Oz fuel 
transfer station were closed July 1, while Erez crossing was 
open for the passage of certain international NGO employees 
and other cases prearranged with the GOI. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) UN contacts report that the Rafah border crossing 
was opened July 1 to one-way traffic from Gaza to Egypt for 
324 individuals.  Hamas provided a list of 5,500 individuals 
wishing to leave Gaza, of which the GOE approved 324.  Of the

Gaza in January following Hamas' breach of the barrier, 
Palestinian students and other "special cases."  According to 
local press, Rafah will be open again for one-way traffice 
from Gaza to Egypt on July 2 and if the border remains calm,
