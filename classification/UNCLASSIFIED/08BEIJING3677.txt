Visit of Chavez 
--------------- 
 
¶2. At the September 23 regular MFA press briefing, spokesperson 
Jiang Yu said that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez arrived in 
Beijing.  Chavez will meet with Vice Premier Li Keqiang and attend a 
signing ceremony with President Hu Jintao.  Jiang said that the 
bilateral relationship is based on mutual benefit and joint 
development.  Asked to respond to alleged irritation in the U.S. 
government over the visit, Jiang said that the bilateral 
relationship between China and Venezuela is a "normal state to state 
relationship" which is "not based on ideology or directed against 
any other country."  Jiang had no information about any military 
cooperation agreement between China and Venezuela. 
 
Tainted Milk 
------------ 
 
¶3. China "attaches great importance to food safety" and has "taken a 
responsible attitude," said Jiang in response to questions about the 
ongoing milk safety scandal.  Jiang said that the New Zealand 
Embassy informed the Chinese government of the problem on September 
9 and an inspection team was sent the same afternoon.  The 
inspection team sent back preliminary test results by the evening of 
September 9, said Jiang.  Jiang noted that all governments face the 
problem of food safety and China has an "established safety 
mechanism" which it will "improve in the future."  Relevant Chinese 
authorities are "ready to work with" other countries to resolve the 
problem. 
 
North Korea 
----------- 
 
¶4. Jiang said that China has "taken note" of reports that North 
Korea has asked to remove IAEA seals at its nuclear facilities. 
China hopes that "relevant parties strengthen communication, display 
flexibility and be jointly committed to the early solution of the 
issue" China also hopes relevant parties will "implement the 
remaining tasks of the second phase in a comprehensive and balanced 
way to promote the Six-Party Talks." 
 
China-Japan Relations 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. Asked for China's opinion of the recent election of Taro Aso to 
lead Japan's LDP party, Jiang said that it was an internal matter 
for Japan.  Jiang said that healthy relations are in the interest of 
the two countries.  Relations will proceed on the basis of the "four 
documents" and the "consensus reached by the two leaders." 
 
Financial Crisis 
---------------- 
 
¶6. Though Presidents Bush and Hu Jintao did not discuss the 
financial crisis during their phone conversation today, China is 
following the situation closely.  China will also strengthen 
communication with financial institutions and markets and analyze 
financial markets to strengthen supervision and preventative 
measures. 
 
Safety of Food Exports to South Korea and Japan 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶7. Asked about food safety concerns regarding Chinese produced fish 
feed exported to South Korea and "tofu paste" exported to Japan, 
Jiang said that the General Administration of Quality Supervision, 
 
BEIJING 00003677  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) acted immediately to deal with 
both cases.  Jiang said that the AQSIQ first heard of the fish feed 
problem "from the internet" and immediately afterward began checking 
fish feed exports.  Jiang said that the accused fish feed maker had 
never exported to the ROK.  China has strengthened supervision of 
animal feed since May, said Jiang.  AQSIQ also acted immediately to 
identify problematic "tofu paste" exported to Japan.  Neither tests 
by the Japanese or Chinese authorities revealed any poisons. 
 
Space Shuttle Launch 
-------------------- 
 
¶8. Asked to comment on the impending launch of the Shenzhou 7 space 
shuttle, Jiang said that "outer space is the shared treasure of the 
human race" and the launch is "part of our effort to make peaceful 
use of outer space." 
 
ASEM Summit 
----------- 
 
¶9. Jiang announced that the Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM) will be held 
in Beijing from September 23-24.  The theme for the conference is 
"vision and action toward a win-win solution."  Political, cultural, 
economic and sustainable development issues will be discussed.
