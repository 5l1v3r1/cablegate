¶1.  (U) This message was coordinated with Consulate General 
Surabaya. 
 
¶2.  (U) SUMMARY:  The GOI has executed the three Bali 
bombers.  The police report that the situation is calm, thus 
far.   Mission has sent out a Warden message.  Press guidance 
is attached in para seven.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Indonesian government executed the three Bali 
bombers just after midnight on November 9 (local).  The 
executions--which took place by firing squad--took place at 
the island prison of Nusa Kambangan located just off of 
central Java.  The three self-confessed terrorists--Amrozi, 
Imam Samudra and Ali Gufron (a.k.a. "Muklas")--had been 
convicted and sentenced to death for their roles in the 
October 2002 bombings in Bali in eastern Indonesia which 
killed over 200 people.  The bodies of the three have 
reportedly been returned to their home areas in East Java 
(Amrozi and Ali Gufron) and the Banten region near Jakarta 
(Imam Samudra) for burial which must take place--per Muslim 
custom--roughly 24 hours after death. 
 
¶4.  (U) The Indonesian police have told RSO that the 
situation is quiet.  There continue to be concerns that small 
extremist groups might try to use the occasion to take to the 
streets and cause problems.  The Indonesian government is 
strongly aware of this and has deployed extra police in 
certain parts of the country.  RSO and staff are keeping in 
close touch with the police on the situation across the 
country. 
 
¶5.  (U) A contact in the President's Office told Pol/C that 
the situation was quiet and that the GOI did not foresee "any 
problems because the vast majority of Indonesians strongly 
condemn terrorism."  An Australian Embassy contact told 
poloff that the GOA is "monitoring the situation closely" but 
had no reports of incidents or unrest.  The GOA reissued its 
travel advisory on Indonesia and FM Stephen Smith issued a 
statement expressing support for the families of the bombing 
victims. 
 
¶6.  (U) Mission sent out a Warden message right after the 
executions briefing AmCits about the situation and urging 
them to take sensible precautions.  The Warden message is on 
Mission's website. 
 
¶7.  (U) Mission is using the attached press guidance:

terrorist attacks in Bali, which caused the death of 202 
people, including seven Americans. 
 
 -- This is an issue decided by the Indonesian judicial 
system and the Government of Indonesia dealt with this in 
accordance with its laws. 
 
 -- The Indonesian people and government are firmly against 
terrorism and have demonstrated their commitment to this 
through their consistent and serious response in apprehending 
and prosecuting terrorists and members of terrorist networks.
