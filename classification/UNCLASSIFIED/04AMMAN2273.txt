ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR VULNERABLE IRAQIS IN JORDAN

¶1.  REGIONAL REFCOORD AND REF ASSISTANT MONITORED ICMC'S 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR VULNERABLE IRAQIS IN 
JORDAN ON FEBRUARY 25 (COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT SPRMCO03CA127). 
IN ADDITION TO MEETINGS AT CARITAS (ICMC'S LOCAL 
IMPLEMENTING PARTNER), WE ALSO CONDUCTED HOME VISITS TO FOUR 
PROSPECTIVE BENEFICIARIES WITH PROJECT CASEWORKERS.  REF 
ASSISTANT AND VISITING PRM/ANE PROGRAM OFFICER ALSO 
MONITORED THE PROJECT IN SEPTEMBER 2003.  CABLE IS KEYED TO 
MONITORING GUIDANCE PROVIDED REF A. 
 
¶A.  REFCOORD AND REF ASSISTANT MET WITH ICMC PROJECT MANAGER 
CLIVE CAVANAGH AND CARITAS PROJECT OFFICER RANA ISHAQ ON 
FEBRUARY 25 AT THE CARITAS PROJECT OFFICE IN AMMAN.  THEY 
ALSO CONDUCTED HOME VISITS WITH CARITAS CASEWORKERS GABY DAW 
AND NADA DALAQ. 
 
¶B.  ICMC AND ITS LOCAL IMPLEMENTING PARTNER CARITAS ARE 
RUNNING A SOLID, WELL-PERFORMING PROJECT THAT IS REACHING 
VULNERABLE IRAQIS THROUGHOUT JORDAN.  IT IS MEETING AND, IN 
SOME CASES, HAS ALREADY EXCEEDED KEY PROJECT OBJECTIVES DUE 
TO HIGH DEMAND FOR ASSISTANCE AND NEGOTIATED REDUCTIONS IN 
THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES.  THE PROJECT ADDRESSES PRM 
CROSS-CUTTING POLICY GOALS OF PROTECTION, WOMEN, CHILDREN 
AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH.  HOWEVER, AS MORE TIME PASSES SINCE 
THE FALL OF SADDAM HUSSEIN'S REGIME, IT IS INCREASINGLY 
DIFFICULT TO CLASSIFY IRAQIS IN JORDAN AS REFUGEES OR ASYLUM- 
SEEKERS.  MOST APPEAR TO BE IRREGULAR MOVERS IN SEARCH OF A 
NEW, PERMANENT HOME.  WHILE THEIR ILLEGAL STATUS LEAVES THEM 
VULNERABLE IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO SERVICES, WE DO NOT BELIEVE 
THAT HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO IRREGULAR IRAQI MOVERS 
SHOULD LAST INDEFINITELY. 
 
¶C.  FROM SEPTEMBER 1, 2003 UNTIL FEBRUARY 15, 2004, CARITAS 
RECEIVED 1,561 CASES, PROVIDING SERVICES TO 1,091 CASES THAT 
MET THE EXTREME VULNERABILITY CRITERIA.  PROJECT MANAGER 
CAVANAGH REPORTS THAT 65 PERCENT OF THE CASES ARE NEW, AS 
PREVIOUS BENEFICIARIES (WHO LAST YEAR KEPT COMING BACK TO 
CARITAS FOR MORE ASSISTANCE) NOW UNDERSTAND THAT CARITAS IS 
ABLE TO PROVIDE ONLY LIMITED ASSISTANCE.  AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 
ICMC PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING SERVICES: 
 
  -     504 IRAQIS RECEIVED OUTPATIENT MEDICAL CARE (VICE A 
     TARGET OF 2,000 BY AUGUST 31) 
-     182 IRAQIS RECEIVED INPATIENT MEDICAL SERVICES (VICE A 
TARGET OF 500 BY AUGUST 31) 
-     268 IRAQIS RECEIVED HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE (VICE A 
TARGET OF 500 BY AUGUST 31) 
-     195 IRAQI CHILDREN ARE ENROLLED IN ACCREDITED PRIMARY 
SCHOOLS (VICE A TARGET OF 100 BY AUGUST 31) 
-     9 IRAQI FAMILIES RECEIVED LIMITED ACCOMMODATIONS 
SUPPORT (NOT INCLUDED AS A SPECIFIC PROJECT OBJECTIVE); AND 
-     7 IRAQI FAMILIES RECEIVED LIMITED FOOD ASSISTANCE (NOT 
INCLUDED AS A SPECIFIC PROJECT OBJECTIVE) 
 
CAVANAGH REPORTS AN INCREASED DEMAND AMONG THE IRAQI 
COMMUNITY FOR BASIC HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, INCLUDING 
REQUESTS FOR RENT AND FOOD ASSISTANCE, PROGRAMS NOT 
SPECIFICALLY COVERED IN THE GRANT AGREEMENT.  IN VERY 
SPECIFIC CASES OF EXTREME VULNERABILITY (E.G., A PREGNANT, 
SINGLE FEMALE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD AND AN ELDERLY WOMAN WHO 
COLLAPSED FROM MALNUTRITION-RELATED PROBLEMS IN THE CARITAS 
OFFICE), CARITAS DECIDED TO USE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 
FUNDS TO PROVIDE EXCEPTIONAL ASSISTANCE SUCH AS TWO MONTHS 
OF RENT (ROUGHLY USD 100) OR A ONE-TIME FOOD AID PACKAGE. 
BASED ON ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE FROM CARITAS CASEWORKERS AND 
FROM THE BENEFICIARIES THEMSELVES, MANY POOR IRAQIS IN 
JORDAN -- BOTH OLD AND NEW CASELOAD -- HAVE SIMPLY EXHAUSTED 
THEIR REMAINING FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND ARE UNABLE TO 
SUPPORT THEMSELVES THROUGH WHATEVER CASUAL JOBS THEY CAN 
FIND.  THERE IS AN INCREASING NUMBER OF FEMALE-HEADED 
HOUSEHOLDS AMONG THE IRAQI COMMUNITY, AS IRAQI MEN LEAVE 
THEIR FAMILIES HERE "TEMPORARILY" EITHER TO REESTABLISH 
HOMES IN IRAQ OR SEEK WORK IN EUROPE, NEVER RETURNING TO 
JORDAN.  A FEW IRAQIS HAVE COME TO JORDAN SPECIFICALLY FOR 
CARITAS' MEDICAL ASSISTANCE BUT CAVANAGH DECLINED TO PROVIDE 
ASSISTANCE TO THESE CASES. 
 
THANKS TO NEGOTIATED REDUCTIONS IN HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION 
COSTS, CARITAS HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO A 
GREATER NUMBER OF IRAQIS.  IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR, 
CAVANAGH NEGOTIATED INPATIENT SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH A NEW 
SERVICE PROVIDER, PALESTINE HOSPITAL, THAT IN TURN PROMPTED 
TRADITIONAL CARITAS PARTNER, THE ITALIAN HOSPITAL, TO REDUCE 
THE RATES CHARGED TO CARITAS UNDER THE GRANT AGREEMENT.  IN 
ADDITION TO REACHING MORE PATIENTS, THE SAVINGS ALSO ENABLED 
CARITAS TO PERFORM A GREATER NUMBER OF MORE COMPLICATED 
MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS HEART OR CANCER SURGERIES. 
IN THE EDUCATION SECTOR, CARITAS HAS BEGUN SENDING IRAQI 
CHILDREN TO GOJ SCHOOLS, AT A COST OF 25 JD (USD 35) PER 
PUPIL PER YEAR, VERSUS THE 177 JD (USD 247) PER PUPIL PER 
YEAR REQUIRED TO SEND STUDENTS TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND 
INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT BUDGET.  REFCOORD VERIFIED COSTS AND 
SERVICES THROUGH A SPOT-INSPECTION OF INVOICES AND COPIES OF 
PRESCRIPTIONS. 
 
CARITAS HAS EXPANDED ITS OPERATIONS TO REACH VULNERABLE 
IRAQIS OUTSIDE AMMAN, INCLUDING IN MAFRAQ, SAHAB AND MADABA. 
IRAQIS LIVING IN THESE AREAS HEARD ABOUT THE CARITAS 
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THROUGH THE IRAQI GRAPEVINE AND MANY HAVE 
BEEN REFERRED TO CARITAS BY OTHER RELIEF AGENCIES, INCLUDING 
UNHCR.  CARITAS COORDINATES EXTENSIVELY WITH OTHER NGOS IN 
JORDAN AND PARTICIPATES IN MEETINGS OF UNHCR IMPLEMENTING 
PARTNERS. 
FINALLY, ICMC - BOTH THROUGH LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE CAVANAGH 
AND GENEVA-BASED STAFF - HAS WORKED WITH CARITAS OFFICIALS 
TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL REPORTING.  CAVANAGH (WHO HAD 
COMPLAINED BITTERLY ABOUT CARITAS' FINANCIAL PROCEDURES 
UNDER THE FIRST GRANT AGREEMENT) SAID ICMC IS NOW SATISFIED 
WITH CARITAS' FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TRANSFERS SYSTEM. 
 
¶D.  CARITAS HAS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED ITS PLANNED NON-FORMAL 
PRIMARY EDUCATION SYSTEM OR ITS HYGIENE AND PEST CONTROL 
KITS.  CARITAS WAS STILL DEVELOPING THE NON-FORMAL EDUCATION 
PROGRAM, MEETING WITH LOCAL VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTERS AND 
NEGOTIATING SERVICE AND PRICE AGREEMENTS.  ONCE CARITAS 
REACHES A SATISFACTORY DEAL (ROUGHLY USD 35-45 PER COURSE), 
IT WILL OFFER COMPUTER AND ENGLISH-LANGUAGE TRAINING TWO 
HOURS PER DAY, FOR TWO MONTHS, TO IRAQI CHILDREN AGES 12-16 
AND YOUNG ADULTS AGES 20-25 WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ENROLLED IN 
FORMAL EDUCATION SYSTEMS IN JORDAN.  CARITAS HAS NOT YET 
STARTED PROVIDING HYGIENE AND PEST CONTROL KITS TO 
VULNERABLE IRAQIS, AS THAT PARTICULAR SERVICE IS NOT 
REQUIRED UNTIL WARMER WEATHER BEGINS.  BASED ON DEMAND FOR 
THESE SERVICES LAST YEAR, CAVANAGH IS CONFIDENT CARITAS WILL 
BE ABLE TO REACH BOTH OBJECTIVES BEFORE AUGUST 31. 
 
BASED ON THE HOME VISITS WE CONDUCTED IN FEBRUARY, IT SEEMS 
THAT MANY IRAQIS IN JORDAN ARE IRREGULAR MOVERS IN SEARCH OF 
A NEW PERMANENT HOME.  FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OF THE FOUR FAMILIES 
WE MET WERE WAITING FOR APPROVAL TO EMIGRATE TO THE U.S. 
UNDER OUR IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM.  NONE OF THE FAMILIES WERE 
RECOGNIZED BY UNHCR AS REFUGEES (ALTHOUGH ALL QUALIFIED FOR 
TEMPORARY PROTECTION) AND NONE HAD ANY INTENT TO RETURN TO 
IRAQ.  WHILE THESE FAMILIES WERE VULNERABLE DUE TO THEIR 
LACK OF ACCESS TO GOJ SERVICES, THREE OF THEM RECEIVED SOME 
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM FAMILY MEMBERS LIVING ABROAD. 
(CARITAS CASEWORKERS WERE QUICK TO RECOGNIZE THE FAMILIES' 
CIRCUMSTANCES AND DID NOT APPROVE THESE THREE FAMILIES FOR 
ASSISTANCE.)  ONLY ONE FAMILY, A FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLD 
WITH YOUNG CHILDREN, DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ANY NON-CARITAS 
SUPPORT. 
 
¶E.  CARITAS' TEAM OF SIX SOCIAL WORKERS, A PROJECT OFFICER, 
PROJECT MANAGER AND ONE SECRETARY SEEMS ADEQUATE FOR THE 
CASELOAD, ESPECIALLY SINCE CARITAS IMPLEMENTED AN 
APPOINTMENT SYSTEM IN SEPTEMBER 2003 THAT ENABLES THE TEAM 
TO BETTER MANAGE THE HIGH DEMAND FOR SERVICES.  ALL 
PERSONNEL APPEAR TO BE FULLY EMPLOYED. 
 
¶F.  THE CARITAS PROJECT OFFICE - THREE ROOMS IN A DOWNTOWN 
AMMAN OFFICE BUILDING -- IS CLEAN, SPACIOUS AND FULLY 
UTILIZED.  ALL EQUIPMENT APPEARS TO BE IN GOOD WORKING ORDER 
AND USED ON A REGULAR BASIS.  CARITAS HAS AN APPROPRIATE 
INVENTORY CONTROL SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR ALL EQUIPMENT AND 
SUPPLIES PURCHASED WITH PRM FUNDS. 
 
¶G.  Refcoord reviewed Caritas' inventory system and 
confirmed that all PRM-purchased equipment can be identified 
and located. 
 
¶H.  WHILE REAL HUMANITARIAN NEEDS EXIST AMONG SOME OF THE 
ESTIMATED 300,000 IRAQIS RESIDENT IN JORDAN, IT IS 
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY CONTINUED ASSISTANCE TO 
IRAQIS LIVING OUTSIDE IRAQ.  NEARLY A YEAR AFTER THE FALL OF 
BAGHDAD, MOST VULNERABLE IRAQIS IN JORDAN SEEM TO FIT THE 
DEFINITION OF ECONOMIC MIGRANT OR IRREGULAR MOVER, RATHER 
THAN REFUGEE.  SHOULD PRM CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ASSISTANCE 
PROGRAMS FOR VULNERABLE IRAQIS IN JORDAN, WE RECOMMEND THAT 
THE PROGRAM BE CAREFULLY TAILORED TO REFLECT UNHCR POLICY ON 
ASSISTED RETURNS.  AS SOON AS UNHCR LIFTS ITS TEMPORARY 
PROTECTION ORDER FOR IRAQIS AND ORGANIZES ASSISTED RETURNS, 
PRM-FUNDED ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS SHOULD CHANGE TO SUPPORT 
VOLUNTARY REPATRIATION.
