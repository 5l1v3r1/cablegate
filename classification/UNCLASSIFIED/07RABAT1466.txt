¶1.  (SBU) Poloff discussed the points conveyed reftels during 
a September 13 meeting with Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Director of Humanitarian and Social Affairs Abdelmounaim El 
Farouk, urging the Government of Morocco (GOM) to support 
Felice Gaer's candidacy to the Committee Against Torture 
(CAT). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) El Farouk responded saying that he would pass the 
request to his superior, but was confident that the GOM would 
support Gaer's candidacy.  He said the GOM has excellent 
relations with the USG and that Gaer and Morocco's delegate 
to the CAT had a good working relationship.  He added that 
Gaer's resume and experience were impressive and made her 
well suited to the position.
