SUBJECT: EGYPT: UNESCO CONVENTION ON CULTURAL EXPRESSIONS, 
IMPLEMENTATION UPDATE 
 
REF: STATE 19851 
 
According to our observations and comments from MFA contacts, 
we believe that there has been no effort to date by the 
Government of Egypt to take legislative action on the UNESCO 
Convention on Cultural Expressions (reftel).  We also have no 
indications that the GOE will take steps to ratify the 
convention at any time in the near term.  Media attention on 
the subject has been virtually non-existent, to our 
knowledge.  In general, there has been no public debate on 
this topic.
