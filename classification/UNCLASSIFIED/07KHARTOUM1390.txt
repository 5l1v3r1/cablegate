BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶3.  On September 1, the high-level committee that oversees the 
implementation of the Joint Communique on the facilitation of 
humanitarian activities in Darfur met for the sixth time since the 
signing of the agreement in March.  The meeting was co-chaired by 
the Government of National Unity (GNU) Minister of Humanitarian 
Affairs and the Acting UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator. 
Attendants included representatives from the GNU Humanitarian 
Affairs Commission (HAC) and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the United 
States, the United Arab Emirates, the Democratic Republic of Congo, 
international and national NGOs, and the UN.  U.S. Charge d'Affaires 
Alberto M. Fernandez and USAID staff attended the meeting in the 
role of the donor observer.  On August 1, the United States replaced 
the European Union in the rotating three-month donor position on the 
committee.

CARE DIRECTOR EXPULSION 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. At the opening of the meeting, members of the committee expressed 
concern over the August 25 expulsion of the CARE country director 
from Sudan.  Committee members noted that the manner of the 
departure undermined recent progress and the spirit of the Joint 
Communique.  Participants welcomed the Minister of Humanitarian 
Affairs announcement that efforts to resolve the issue were ongoing 
and that further discussions with the senior management of CARE were 
planned for the coming days.  (Note: Following the conclusion of the 
high-level committee meeting, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs 
reported that the government had agreed to permit the CARE Country 
Director Paul Barker to temporarily return to Sudan in order to 
facilitate program handover to his successor.  However, Barker 
reportedly rejected the Sudanese government's offer of returning 
unless the persona non grata status (PNG) is revoked entirely.  End 
note.)

PROGRESS REPORT 
--------------- 
 
¶5.  The Tripartite Joint Technical Committee (TJTC) presented a 
progress report to the committee highlighting the completion of the 
Directory of Procedures for NGOs and continuing efforts to refine 
the fast-track database.  The Directory of Procedures for NGOs in 
Sudan represents a culmination of extensive collaboration and 
dialogue between the Sudanese government and international NGOs. 
The directory provides clear guidance on required documentation, and 
operating procedures for NGOs in Sudan, including an annex for 
Darfur-specific fast-track procedures.  Intended to ensure 
transparency and facilitate the timely navigation of bureaucratic 
procedures by NGOs operating in Darfur and throughout Sudan, the 
directory will be published and widely circulated to NGOs and 
Sudanese embassies in Khartoum and worldwide. 
Annexes pertaining to fees and timeframes are scheduled to be 
complete by September 15, at which time, pending resolution of media 
guidance language, publication will go forward.  As soon as 
possible, a decision regarding media guidance will be transmitted by 
the committee co-chairs to the TJTC to ensure the swift publication 
of the procedures.

¶6.  To support the dissemination and implementation of the Directory 
of Procedures, trainings for NGOs and Joint Procedures Center (JPC) 
staff are planned for September.  In addition, the TJTC is preparing 
a second directory for government officials outlining guidance on 
how to implement revised procedures.  The government directory will 
serve as a resource for officials, particularly at the state and 
local level, to facilitate consistent implementation. 
 
¶7.  The TJTC reported that efforts to refine the fast-track database 
continue.  Technical difficulties and incomplete reporting from NGOs 
have undermined the efficacy of the database, to date.  The TJTC 
hopes to utilize upcoming trainings on the Directory of Procedures 
to educate and encourage NGOs to provide more consistent and timely 
updates.  Regular reporting will facilitate the usefulness of the 
data-base as a tool for monitoring outstanding issues and GNU 
adherence to the communique. 
 
---------- 
CONCLUSION 
---------- 
 
¶8.  Committee members acknowledged the positive developments 
generated from continued efforts of the TJTC and the high-level 
committee in advancing the agenda of the Joint Communique and 
encouraged ongoing dialogue and communication.  Prior to the next 
meeting of the high-level committee scheduled for September 22, the 
TJTC will prepare a summary report on the achievements, challenges, 
and constraints of the Joint Communique to date.  The report will 
fulfill reporting requirements outlined in UN Security Council 
Resolution 1769 establishing the UN/African Union Mission in Darfur 
(UNAMID).  The high-level committee also agreed to invite UNAMID as 
an observer to the next meeting.
