  Editorial Quotes

¶1. XINJIANG RIOT 
 
a. "July 5" incident will not create chaos in China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/08): "After the large chaos on July 5th, 
small scale chaos, demonstrations and conflicts continue. 
Comparable to favoring Tibet's independence, most western media 
chose to support the opposition and not the mainstream opinion of 
the Chinese people.  Chinese experts indicate that, this time, 
forces overseas have secretly stabbed us.  Chinese society is 
completely capable of dealing with this.  The Chinese public should 
express their sentiment and advocate justice within the legal 
framework.  It is necessary for China's maturity to step towards 
modernization. Western media has been unfriendly.  On July 6th, 
during a regular press conference of the U.S. Department of State, 
some reporters said that the Chinese government had violated human 
rights, implying that the death of about 140 people were caused by 
the Chinese government.  Chinese scholars said that the west has 
always been prejudiced towards China.  They have become more 
defensive as China begins rising.  The attitude of the west can't 
really pressure China.  As long as it is illegal violence which 
damages the people's safety and assets, the Chinese government will 
firmly and rapidly conduct a crackdown.  The Chinese people should 
not let the Xinjiang independence separatists' plot destroy China's 
stability; they cannot be successful." 
 
b. "China doesn't need to care about foreign noise" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/08):  "Western media organizations focus 
on national conflicts when reporting on the Xinjiang riot incident. 
Two American congressmen even sent letters to Secretary Hillary 
[Clinton] requesting that the U.S. government condemn China's 
'suppression.'  The actions of the west are just like their actions 
during last year's 'March 14' riot in Tibet.  They never miss the 
chance to provoke conflict among Chinese nationalities in order to 
realize their ulterior goals.  China's national condition is 
complicated; it has a large territory and 56 nationalities.  The 
July 5th incident shows that all nationalities living in Xinjiang 
will be victims once the social stabilities are destroyed. 
Xinjiang's GDP per capita is 3,000 USD, far higher than Xinjiang's 
bordering countries, which greatly benefit from the stability and 
the country's rapid economic development.  All the Chinese people, 
including the Xinjiang people, should jointly make an effort to 
maintain stability and development." 
 
¶2. U.S. ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY 
 
"The 'anti-foreign corruption act' of the U.S. is not fair to 
China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/08):  "The U.S. 'Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act' is not fair to China.  It has to a certain extent influenced 
U.S. companies' investment in China, and Chinese companies' trade in 
the U.S.  Based on the Act, the possibility to find government 
officials who are corrupt is higher in China than in other 
countries.  Therefore the punishment on Chinese corruption will be 
more severe than in other countries. It is not fair to define the 
corrupt deeds of China's state-owned enterprise' employees as the 
government's corruption.  Due to the cultural differences, some 
small gift-giving is taken as a courtesy in China, but a bribe based 
on the U.S. law.  It will scare away some American companies who 
planned to explore the Chinese market.  Earlier, China's Supreme 
People's Court stated that employees of all companies who take 
bribes should be treated equally, but not on the basis of 
state-owned or private-owned company.  This view is far different 
from the definition of the U.S. law."
