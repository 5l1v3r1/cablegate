SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATIONS 050197967  AND 050198220 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
1.This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests AIT Taipei's assistance in 
conducting a pre-license, end-use check on applications 
050197967 and 050198220 for the export of International 
Traffic in Arms (ITAR)-controlled datalink equipment to 
Taiwan.  AIT Taipei is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern inquiry within 30 days.  Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern inquiry will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Foreign Consignee Carbon-Based 
Technology, Inc. has never appeared on a license; sensitive 
ITAR equipment. 
 
¶4. Action:   Department requests that AIT Taipei make 
inquiries to establish the bona fides of the foreign 
consignee in the proposed transactions.  If possible, conduct 
a site visit to assess the company's reliability as a 
recipient of United States Munitions List (USML) items as 
well as its operations and on-site security. Emphasize that 
the unauthorized re-export or retransfer of USML items is 
strictly prohibited.  Confirm with the end-user that it 
placed the orders for the items listed below for the purpose 
stated on the applications.  Determine whether any other 
Taiwan-based firms are involved in the procurement of the 
items. Remind the end-user that the unauthorized re-export or 
retransfer of United States Munitions List (USML) items is 
strictly prohibited. 
 
The following questions provide guidance: 
 
-  Please confirm orders for the items listed on licenses 
050197967 and 050198220. 
 
-  Does Carbon-Based Technology understand the restrictions 
against the unauthorized re-export or retransfer of 
U.S.-origin defense articles? 
 
-  Does Carbon-Based Technology serve as a broker of USML 
articles with any countries besides Taiwan? If so, where?  If 
your company has offices abroad, where are they located? Has 
this company ever used any other names? 
 
- How long has your company been in the business of importing 
and selling defense articles? 
 
-  What other products are sold by this company? 
 
-  How long has Carbon-Based Technology, Inc. been involved 
in business operations with End-User Chung Shan Institute of 
Science and Technology? 
 
-  What business relationship, if any, does your company have 
with the Government of Taiwan? 
 
End Action Request.
