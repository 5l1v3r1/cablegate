¶1.   THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY THE "CHRONICLE" 
  DEDICATED ITS SEPTEMBER 17 EDITORIAL TO THE SEPTEMBER 
  11 TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE U. S.  UNDER HEADLINE 
  "INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM A THREAT TO ALL," THE PAPER 
  COMMENTS: 
 
¶2.   "THE TERRORIST ATTACK ON THE U. S. LAST WEEK IS 
  BOUND 
  TO HAVE REPERCUSSIONS TOO TERRIBLE TO IMAGINE. 
  PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S DECLARATION OF WAR AGAINST 
  THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACKS. . .HAS SET OFF A 
  TORRENT OF WARNINGS OF DIRE CONSEQUENCES FROM 
  VARIOUS QUARTERS. . . IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE OF 
  WARNINGS AND RECRIMINATIONS THAT NEED NEVER HAD 
  HAPPENED IF THE SIEGE ON THE U. S. HAD NOT OCCURRED. 
  THE ATTACK ON THE U. S. ESTABLISHMENTS, WHICH IS 
  EXPECTED TO HAVE A DEATH TOLL RUNNING INTO 
  THOUSANDS, HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT INTERNATIONAL 
  TERRORISM IS A THREAT TO ALL HUMAN BEINGS.  BUT AS 
  LONG AS THERE ARE 'SUICIDE BOMBERS' AND 'SUICIDE 
  PILOTS' PREPARED TO DIE IN ORDER TO KILL THOUSANDS 
  OF OTHER INNOCENT PEOPLE IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW 
  THIS CATASTROPHIC APPROACH CAN BE CURBED. . .  THE 
  FACT THAT THE LATEST ATTACKS OCCURRED IN SPITE OF 
  AMERICA'S MILITARY MIGHT AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AT 
  ITS DISPOSAL POINTS TO THE NEED TO GO BACK TO BASICS 
  - DIALOGUE - TO CONVINCE THOSE BEHIND INTERNATIONAL 
  TERRORISM OF THE INHUMANITY OF THEIR APPROACH."
