¶1.  The Paris-based Chad opposition web site "Al-Wihda" 
(alwihdainfo.com) has carried a number of postings concerning 
American Cash Steven Godbold, seized by the MDJT on October 12 in 
Zoumri, Chad, including one by the group which claims to have seized 
him. We cannot attest to the authenticity of any of these 
statements. 
 
¶2.  In an October 18 statement posted on Al-Wihda the MDJT issued 
the following press release (Embassy translation from the original 
French): 
 
Begin text: 
MDJT would like to inform national and international readership and 
the neighboring countries of Chad that it has detained an American 
citizen by the name of Cash Steven Jodold (sic) since October 10, 
¶2007.  Mr. Jodold, born in 1959 in Florida has fraudulently entered 
the territories under the control of MDJT.  We suspect this 
individual to be sent by the regime of Ndjamena in order to create a 
division inside the Movement.  The regime does not hesitate to use 
any means in order to divide the Chadian people.  Thanks to our 
vigilance we have been able to arrest this mercenary at the service 
of the Chadian regime.  We ask all foreigners not to venture into 
the regions under the control of MDJT. 
 
Furthermore, the MDJT high command has warned the MPS [ruling party] 
regime against any attempt to take back its agent by force. 
 
We are willing to release this individual to his country of origin. 
We assure the detainee's family that he is in good health and well 
treated. 
 
Issued in Zoumri on 10-13-2007 
Assistant Secretary General of MDJT 
Hissein Yaya Barka

¶3.  An October 18 posting by Ousmane Hissein, based in Paris and 
described as the "Political Adviser and Spokesman for the MDJT" 
condemned the seizure as a cowardly and terrorist act.  He said that 
it had been carried out by former MDJT President Choua Dazi at the 
behest of President Quaddafi.  The motive for the seizure, according 
to Hissein, was that Quaddafi viewed the presence of Americans in 
Tibesti as "espionage in his back yard" and a hindrance to his 
expansionist ambitions in Chad.  An October 20 posting by another 
group, the Council for the Reform and Promotion of the MDJT (French 
acronym CIP/MDJT) by spokesman Severin Dingaoro (also based in 
Paris), strongly condemned the seizure. 
 
¶4.  Tripoli minimize considered.
