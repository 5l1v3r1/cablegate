PRIME MINISTER CLARK DESCRIBES THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP AND SHARED 
VALUES 
 
¶2. Audio aired on Radio New Zealand's influential, flagship 
breakfast program, Morning Report on July 5, had Prime Minister 
Clark noting values that are shared by New Zealand and the United 
States. 
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: For us it is also a day when New Zealanders can 
reaffirm the strong friendship we have with the United States. We 
share the values of freedom and democracy which are being celebrated 
her this evening-and we do have a long history of working together 
for a free, democratic, secure and prosperous world. END 
TRANSCRIPT. 
¶3. The (07/05/06) capital-based Dominion Post (the country's second 
largest circulation daily newspaper) characterized the speech as 
follows. 
BEGIN TEXT: Prime Minister Helen Clark said July 4 was a day for New 
Zealanders to reaffirm "our strong friendship" with the US. She 
spoke of the long history of working together toward a free and 
prosperous world. END TEXT. 
¶4. The country's largest circulation daily, the (07/05/06) 
Auckland-based New Zealand Herald, added: 
BEGIN TEXT: A jovial Helen Clark received a warm welcome at the US 
Embassy's colorful Wellington bash, where she delivered a short but 
positive speech emphasizing the bright side of New Zealand's 
relationship with the United States. 
"New Zealand and the United States have worked alongside each other 
in many conflicts from World War One on," Helen Clark said. 
"Our servicemen and women are cooperating today in Afghanistan to 
help restore stability there and give development a chance, as well 
as to counter terrorism." 
The Prime Minister then went on to say that New Zealand's 
relationship with the United States "is of fundamental importance to 
our country, and one which we greatly value". 
"I know it will continue to grow and develop in the 21st century as 
it has in the past." END TEXT. 
 
MEDIA AND OTHERS CONSIDER THE SIGNIFICANCE ON THE PM's ATTENDANCE. 
 
¶5. Radio New Zealand reporting predicted that the United States 
would welcome "Helen Clark's goodwill gesture" and reported that the 
gesture even enjoyed qualified support from her political 
Opposition. 
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: It is a sentiment that National's Deputy Gerry 
Brownlee has...sympathy for. While describing it as 'interesting' 
that it was Helen Clark's first appearance at Independence Day 
celebrations in 7 years he believes that there is clearly a thawing 
in relations. END TRANSCRIPT. 
¶6. The New Zealand Herald article headed "Party guest on more than a 
social visit" (07/05/06) said the PM's attendance was intended to 
send a signal. 
 
BEGIN TEXT: However, while her office was keen to play down any 
significance in her appearance it is difficult to read the Prime 
Minister's move as anything other than purposeful - albeit small. 
END TEXT. 
 
¶7. Both television networks agreed. TV3's political editor noted "It 
won't be lost on the Americans that Helen Clark has taken the time 
to attend these celebrations" (07/04) and TVNZ's political editor 
adding his opinion "...it is significant that she hasn't been before 
and is now attending this Fourth of July and there have been some 
signs of a thawing in the relationship." (07/04) 
 
¶8. Three days later (07/07/06) TVNZ continued to highlight the 
significance with their political editor, Guyon Espiner, saying: 
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: Well you bring it back to human relations. If your 
friend has a birthday party and you don't show, you can say well we 
are still friends- I just didn't turn up. But turning up means 
something doesn't it? And international relations are the same. It's 
the same when you greet someone -- do you give them a kiss on the 
cheek, do you hug them, do you shake their hand- those are gestures 
that we have in our relations with other people are the same with 
countries and of course it means something if you turn up for the 
first time. She wanted to make that known- they would have 
appreciated it. These things get written down and cabled over to 
Washington- of course they mean something. END TRANSCRIPT. 
¶9. The July 4 edition of the Dominion Post ran an article entitled 
 
WELLINGTON 00000512  002 OF 002 
 
 
"Clark flies July 4 truce flag" in which they reported: 
BEGIN TEXT: Prime Minister Helen Clark, in what appears to be a 
goodwill gesture, is likely to attend Independence Day celebrations 
organized by the United States embassy. END TEXT. 
However the following day they reported "[The PM] was able to attend 
this year's celebrations because she was not taking her normal 
winter holiday during the two-week parliamentary recess." 
¶10. (SBU) Embassy Officers confirm that it is rare for the New 
Zealand Prime Minister to attend any foreign country's national day 
event. We understand from GNZ sources that Clark's office has played 
down her attendance and repeatedly referred to her very full diary 
in order to avoid setting expectations that she will attend other 
national day functions.  They also want to make clear that her usual 
non-attendance is not meant as a slight. 
 
¶11. CONCLUSION: Prime Minister Clark's interaction with the Embassy 
on Independence Day was widely noted by the New Zealand media. The 
consensus of New Zealand commentators is that both her attendance 
and her speech were intended as deliberate, and very public, 
goodwill gestures.
