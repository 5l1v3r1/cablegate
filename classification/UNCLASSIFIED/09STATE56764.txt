SUBJECT: TRAVEL ALERT - LEBANON 
 
¶1. The Department of State alerts Americans traveling to 
or residing in Lebanon that Lebanese Parliamentary 
elections will be held on June 7, 2009.  The U.S. Embassy 
in Beirut, Lebanon, expects greater than normal traffic 
congestion, and large crowds at or near polling stations 
on that day.  The Embassy expects the elections will 
occur in a peaceful and orderly fashion, but reminds 
American citizens in Lebanon that even peaceful 
gatherings and demonstrations can turn violent 
unexpectedly.  This Travel Alert expires on June 30, 
¶2009. 
 
¶2. American citizens planning travel to Lebanon just 
before or immediately after the elections should 
carefully consider the necessity of such travel before 
making final plans.  The U.S. Embassy has maintained a 
Travel Warning for Lebanon for many years, and continues 
to advise American citizens to avoid all travel to 
Lebanon. 
 
¶3. American citizens in Lebanon are advised to monitor 
their own security situation at all times, and to avoid 
large public gatherings, protests, and demonstrations. 
American citizens are encouraged to report unusual events 
or activity to the Embassy immediately. 
 
¶4. Updated information on travel and security in Lebanon 
may be obtained from the Department of State by calling 
1-888-407-4747 within the United States and Canada or, 
from overseas, 1-202-501-4444.  Additional details can be 
found in the Department of State's Country Specific 
Information for Lebanon and the Worldwide Caution, which 
are available on the Department's Internet website at 
http://travel.state.gov. 
 
¶5. Minimize considered.
