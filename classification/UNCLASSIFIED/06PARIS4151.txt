SUBJECT:  UNESCO EXECUTIVE BOARD, REQUEST FOR GUIDANCE 
 
 
¶1.  The Executive Board will begin work on the C/4 and C/5 budget 
planning documents at its upcoming session (September 25-October 
11).  Mission has been informed that we will soon receive a letter 
from the Chairman of the EB requesting each electoral group to name 
three representatives to a drafting group that will start work on a 
preliminary version of the C/4 and C/5 during the Board meeting. 
Both Norway and Canada have told us that they are interested in 
joining the working group and we are sure that at least one EU 
member will represent Group I, as the EU member states have been 
actively coordinating their positions on the new budget.  (Note:  As 
there are EU members in Group II, the EU will probably have at least 
two representatives on the drafting group.)  U.S. delegation 
participated in the drafting group that worked on the current C/3 
during the previous biennium. 
 
¶2.  Action requested:  As there will likely be a Group 1 meeting on 
this issue in the coming weeks, please provide guidance as to 
whether Mission should actively seek a seat on the drafting group.
