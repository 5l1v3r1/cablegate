SUBJECT: GUINEA-BISSAU: AMBASSADOR ANNOUNCES OPENING OF 
BISSAU LIAISON OFFICE 
 
 
¶1.  The Ambassador cut the ribbon at the new liaison office 
in Bissau on July 6 remarking that the opening of the office 
and meeting rooms signified the first step toward reopening 
the U.S. Embassy.  Officially, the office will not be open 
until a final security certification is completed later this 
summer. 
 
¶2.  Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation 
and Communities Maria de Conceicao Nobre Cabral represented 
the Government of Guinea-Bissau.  The Foreign Minister noted 
the importance to Guinea-Bissau of the opening of the office 
and reiterated her government,s desire for a quick return of 
the U.S. embassy.  She said the U.S. presence is needed to 
lend support and guidance as the country struggles to escape 
its cycle of violence and improve economic and social 
development. 
 
¶3.  Television, radio, newspapers and a stringer from Reuters 
provided positive press coverage of the event.  Immediately 
following the ribbon cutting, the Ambassador hosted a 
reception for approximately 70 government, diplomatic, 
business and civil society leaders at a hotel in Bissau. 
There was an overwhelming sense of encouragement among guests 
at the prospect of the return of the U.S. in a permanent 
capacity to Guinea-Bissau and many guests echoed the Foreign 
Minister,s call for a speedy re-opening of the embassy. 
 
¶4.  The liaison office is in leased commercial space that has 
been approved by Diplomatic Security and OBO.  Once the 
office is open, it will be occupied by one Locally Engaged 
Staff (LES), a part-time contractor and TDYers who require 
use of the space.  A job description has been posted for a 
second LES position to handle growing administrative duties 
in preparation for moving the Guinea-Bissau Watcher position 
from Dakar to Bissau in summer 2008.
