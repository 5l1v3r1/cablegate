SUBJECT: UNITED RUSSIA CANDIDATE WINS PETROZAVODSK MAYORALTY 
 
REF: ST. PETERSBURG 75 
 
¶1. (SBU) United Russia candidate Nikolay Levin won, as expected, 
the July 5 mayoral election in Petrozavodsk with 59% of the 
vote, according to the Karelian Central Election Commission. 
After  his main rival and previous opposition leader Davletkhan 
Alikhanov dropped out of the race in mid-June (reftel), Levin's 
victory was more or less assured as none of his remaining 
opponents in the election had widespread appeal among the 
electorate. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Of the other candidates in the race, Anatoliy 
Tyomnyshev of Right Cause led with 16% of the vote, followed by 
Liberal Democrat Natalya Buzova with 12%, and rounded out by 
independent Yevgeniy Mikheev with 6%.  Several other minor 
candidates all garnered less than 3% in total. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Turnout for the special election was just 21%, 
continuing a declining trend over the past decade (voter turnout 
was 58% in 1998; 50% in 2002; and 36% in 2006).  It is likely 
the turnout was especially low in this election because of the 
near certainty of the eventual outcome, as well as the fact that 
the election was held on a Sunday in "high dacha season," when 
many Russians were spending the weekend away from their homes.
