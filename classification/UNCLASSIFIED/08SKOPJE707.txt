P/E Chief delivered reftel points to MFA Director of 
Multilateral Affairs Zoran Dabik regarding opposing UNGA 
resolutions with anti-Israel bias.  Dabik indicated that 
Macedonia will continue to follow the EU lead on these 
matters.  He noted that at the last UNGA, EU states were 
either absent or abstained from the vote on anti-Israel 
resolutions.  He did not know what the EU plan is for this 
UNGA regarding such resolutions.
