-- The spokesperson had no information about reported trips to the 
DPRK by either State Councilor Dai Bingguo or Premier Wen Jiabao. 
 
-- China firmly opposed foreign officials meeting with the Dalai 
Lama and opposed the Dalai Lama's engagement in "separatist 
activities in any country or under any name." 
 
-- The spokesperson had not heard reports that two Indian border 
guards had suffered gunshot wounds while on duty near the 
India-Chinese border. 
 
-- Iran's recent agreement to meet with representatives of six

Leadership Trips to DPRK 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  At the regularly scheduled MFA press conference spokesperson 
Jiang Yu said she had "no information" about rumors that State 
Councilor Dai Bingguo would travel to the DPRK. Regarding reports 
that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao would travel to North Korea, Jiang 
said that she had "no information to release." China attached great 
importance to friendly relations and cooperation with neighboring 
countries, said Jiang. China also maintained "close friendly 
exchanges" with neighboring countries, added the spokesperson. 
 
 
Dalai Lama Meetings with USG 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. Asked about reports that members of the Obama Administration 
planned to meet with the Dalai Lama, Jiang said that "China's 
position on Tibet was "clear and consistent -- China firmly opposed 
foreign officials meeting with "Dalai."  China also opposed the 
Dalai Lama's engagement in "separatist activities in any country or 
under any name."  China was further opposed to "any foreign forces" 
using the Tibet issue to interfere in China's internal affairs.  The 
United States Government was "very clear" on China's opposition, 
said Jiang. 
 
China-India Border 
------------------ 
 
¶4. The spokesperson had not heard reports that two Indian border 
guards had suffered gunshot wounds while on duty near the 
India-China border.  Jiang noted that some Indian media 
organizations had released "inaccurate information" about the border 
situation in the past and suggested such journalists might have 
ulterior motives.   Jiang said that she hoped Indian media would do 
more to contribute to peace and understanding between the two 
countries.  China and India had reached an agreement to make joint 
efforts to ensure the peace and tranquility of the border area 
before a settlement could be reached, said Jiang. 
 
Iran Nuclear Issue 
------------------ 
 
¶5. Iran's recent agreement to meet with representatives of the 
P5-plus-1 was "an important step" that was "welcomed by China." 
Relevant parties should "seize the opportunity" and "step up 
efforts" to resolve the issue.  Parties should use the meeting to 
obtain positive results and to restart dialogue and negotiation. 
 
Japan Issues 
------------ 
 
¶6. Referring to a recent dispute with Japan, the spokesperson said 
that Japanese claims for a continental shelf demarcation and an 
exclusive economic zone surrounding "a reef that could neither 
support human life or economic activity" violated UN agreements and 
had garnered international attention.  China hoped the UN commission 
on seabed claims would properly handle the issue.  Separately, Jiang 
said that China looked forward to strengthening cooperation and 
exchanges with Japan and making progress in the future. 
 
Assistance for Afghanistan 
--------------------------- 
 
¶7. China was committed to the peace process in South Asia and had 
cooperated with Afghanistan on numerous issues including in training 
personnel, said Jiang.  China had taken part in the peaceful 
reconstruction of Afghanistan and hoped the country would have peace 
and prosperity, said Jiang. 
 
South Korea, Japan, China

summit modalities once a meeting was confirmed.
