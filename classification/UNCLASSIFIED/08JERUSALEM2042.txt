GREATER ROLE IN PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI PEACE PROCESS 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
All front pages run statements by Israeli Foreign Minister Livni 
rejecting "extensive" engagement by president-elect Obama in the 
Middle East peace process.  The papers cite Reuters in quoting Livni 
during a November 13 meeting with Jewish-Americans in New York, 
where she also objected to the return of, "even one Palestinian 
refugee."  Livni is further quoted telling the audience, "please 
don't interfere, this is a bilateral process.  Don't try to bridge 
gaps between us, and don't propose new ideas."   In related news, 
the front pages of Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida report that 
President Bush and Saudi King Abdullah met on the margins of the UN 
sponsored interfaith conference and discussed the peace process and 
international financial crisis. 
 
Al Hayat Al Jadida front pages statements by former Israeli minister 
Yussi Baylin asking Israel on November 13 to reach a settlement with 
Palestinians on the West Bank only, excluding Hamas and the Gaza 
Strip.  The front page also runs statements by the Jordanian Foreign 
Minister urging the incoming U.S. administration to actively engage 
in the Middle East peace process. 
 
The three dailies lead with news of the shutdown of power in Gaza 
due to fuel shortages, showing pictures of children reading by the 
light of candles and kerosene lamps.  Al Quds notes that hospitals, 
basic services and the water supply are threatened by the shutdown. 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam report that UNRWA Commissioner General Abu Zayd 
told Reuters on November 13 that she is concerned over Israel's 
policy to only allow humanitarian assistance into the Strip, adding 
that school supplies will be excluded from future UNRWA deliveries 
to Gaza. 
 
Al Quds' front page notes warnings by UN Peace Envoy Richard Myron 
and Quartet Representative Tony Blair of a collapse of the Gaza 
truce between Hamas and Israel.  Blair called for the creation of 
conditions that facilitate Palestinian unity and prevent the firing 
of rockets into Israel, in order to deny Israel a "pretext" for 
closing Gaza crossings, Al Quds continued. 
 
The three papers front page statements by Palestinian Authority 
Premier Fayyad, made in Paris on November 13.  Fayyad is quoted 
saying that Israel is endangering the peace process with its 
continued settlement activity.  Fayyad called for a halt to 
settlement activity in the Palestinian Territories, including 
Jerusalem, in order to begin to rebuild the credibility of the peace 
process, the papers report. 
 
Al Quds reveals on its front page the existence of an internal 
document issued by the Hamas polit bureau that questions the 
credibility of Egyptian efforts towards reuniting Palestinians.  The 
document also questions Fatah's motives for joining in the Cairo 
dialogue and accuses Fatah of seeking to end Hamas control of the 
Gaza Strip and launch new elections "tailored" to Fatah's needs.  In 
related news, Al Ayyam's front page quotes PLO Executive Committee 
member Yasir Abid Rabbo confirming on November 13 that Palestinian 
internal dialogue remains under the sponsorship of Egypt and will 
not be transferred to the Arab League. 
 
On an inside page, Al Hayat Al Jadida reports that USAID has signed 
an agreement to support basic education in the Palestinian 
Territories.  The agreement was signed in Ramallah on November 13, 
in the presence of USAID Director Sumka and Palestinian officials, 
under the auspices of the Palestinian Authority Minister of

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
1)  Mohamad Yaghy opines in Al Ayyam under the title, "Obama is not 
a replacement for Arab and Palestinian will" (11/14):  "How can 
[peace] negotiations succeed when Hamas rejects them outright?... 
the problem isn't in the appointment of the Jewish Rahm [to White 
House Chief of Staff] since he won't be the one drafting U.S. 
foreign policy... the problem is and will remain Arab refusal to 
take on their role [in the peace process] and their preference to 
wait and see what comes from the other side of the ocean." 
 
2)  Al Quds editorial is titled, "No alternative to dialogue" 
(11/14):  "There is no alternative for the two parties [Fatah and 
Hamas] but to pursue dialogue ... any other alternative, such as 
those advanced by non-Palestinian agendas, will not lead to 
anything, but more suffering and catastrophe... The Palestinian 
people are optimistic about the success of a meeting among 
Palestinian factions in general, and between Fatah and Hamas in 
particular, because they believe that the Palestinian cause and 
higher interests will trump all differences."
