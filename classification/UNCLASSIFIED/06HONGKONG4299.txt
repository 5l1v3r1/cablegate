SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: POST SHIPMENT VERIFICATION: 
BOWORLD INDUSTRIES LTD. 
 
REF: A) USDOC 05671 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the Bureau of 
Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control Officer 
(ECO) Philip Ankel conducted a post shipment 
verification (PSV) at Boworld Industries Ltd., Room 
903, 113 Argyle St. Kowloon, Hong Kong (Boworld) on 
October 25, 2006. This PSV concerned high voltage reed 
switches exported by Hermetic Switch, Inc. of 
Chickasha, Oklahoma (Hermetic) classified by Hermetic 
under ECCN 3A228 and valued at $4,564.  ECCN 3A228 is 
controlled for nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons. 
 
¶3. A review of the Hong Kong Companies Registry 
revealed that Boworld has been in existence since 
¶1992.  Boworld's Directors are Wen Hui Yu and Tang Mei 
Chen (a Taiwanese passport holder).  Other companies 
with similar names (including Boworld Limited, Boworld 
International Limited) were dissolved in 1992. 
 
¶4.  A web based search revealed that the phone number 
and address listed for Boworld in Reftel A correspond 
to other Hong Kong registered companies including 
Union Grand Enterprises Limited, Friendly Development 
Ltd. and Hogus Ind'l Ltd.  Contact with Boworld's Hong 
Kong number produced a meeting with a Ms. Lee at the 
premises of Boworld.  The premises themselves were a 
small office occupied by several clerical staff. 
 
¶5.  According to Ms. Lee, Boworld acts as freight 
forwarder for companies in mainland China.  It accepts 
shipments on behalf of mainland Chinese companies, 
completes customs formalities and then arranges for 
those items to be forwarded to customers in mainland 
China. 
 
¶6.  Ms. Lee did not have the underlying transaction 
documents for the shipments noted in Reftel A since 
those documents had been forwarded onward with the 
shipment to mainland China.  Ms. Lee did, however, 
provide a Winwide Cargo Express Co., Ltd. packing slip 
showing that the package containing the items 
referenced in reftel A had been sent to China.  The 
destination in China was Ge-Ding Information Inc.'s 
(Ge-Ding) China production facility in DungGuan.  Ge- 
Ding is a Taiwanese switch and sensor manufacturer 
(www.reedsensor.com.tw) and is listed as the purchaser 
in the Hermetic invoice for this transaction. 
Coincidentally, Boworld had recently forwarded a very 
similar shipment of switches on behalf of Hermetic for 
which Ms. Lee had the applicable documentation.  The 
date of exportation noted on the application shippers 
export declaration (SED) was 10/18/06 and the 
transportation reference number was 
1Z7304696600196655.  While Ms. Lee was helpful and 
forthcoming in providing copies of the underlying 
documents, it is apparent to the ECO that Boworld is 
unfamiliar with the export control requirements 
related to these shipments. 
 
¶7.  The ECO notes that ECCN 3A228 would appear to 
require an export license to both Hong Kong and China, 
and therefore the shipment of the items NLR (No 
License Required) by Hermetic would appear to have 
been inappropriate. 
 
¶8. At the time visited, the consignee Boworld appeared 
to be an unsuitable recipient of controlled 
commodities since it has no Hong Kong production 
facility and acts merely as freight forwarder for 
shipments through Hong Kong.  The ECO recommends that 
this PSV be classified as Unfavorable.
