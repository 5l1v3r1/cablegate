SUBJECT: PRESS REPORTS PROGRESS IN BREAKING UP TRAFFICKING 
IN PERSONS NETWORKS 
 
 
The Spanish daily ABC reported September 18 that the Spanish 
National Police have dismantled one hundred illegal 
immigration, document falsification, and prostitution 
networks during 2004.  Additionally, more than 300 people 
have been arrested during the year by the Immigration Network 
and False Documents Group within the National Police. 
Arrests stopped or hindered human trafficking criminal 
networks run by Eastern Europeans, primarily led by Romanians 
but also by Albanians; South American networks run by 
Ecuadorians, Peruvians, and Colombians; and Asian networks, 
where the Chinese "mafia" is reportedly dominant.  The 
Spanish National Police broke up 70 criminal networks and 
made 200 arrests during 2003.  In 2004, the police are on 
pace to arrest greater numbers of human traffickers according 
to press reporting.  The ABC report provides further possible 
insights into human trafficking issues, which we will 
investigate with GOS authorities in our discussions on TIP.
