The recent U.S. arms export embargo on Zimbabwe has 
received significant play in the Zimbabwe's independent 
newspaper.  The government-controlled print and electronic 
media has, so far, ignored the story.  However, the April 
19 edition of the country's only independent daily "The 
Daily News" carries a wire article by Reuters News Agency 
on page one, under headline "U. S. widens sanctions by 
slapping ban on sale of defense equipment."  The April 18 
edition of the independent financial weekly "The Financial 
Gazette" also printed the Reuters story on page 54, under 
headline "U. S. bans defense equipment sells to Zimbabwe."
