¶1.  On March 11, conservative, influential, newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (Sun. circ. 260,108) carried an editorial entitled "Iran's 
Diplomacy in Latin America."  Quote: 
 
¶2.  "Iran is actively engaged with the President of Venezuela to 
increase its influence in Latin America....  An eventual active 
presence of Iran in our region is no longer irrelevant, it is a 
threat.  Iran violates international agreements for the peaceful 
development of nuclear energy and, therefore, threatens 
international security and peace; it openly supports violence in the 
Middle East through Hezbollah, and threatens the existence of the 
state of Israel.  Iran and Venezuela also violate...the principle of 
sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other 
countries.  The ties between Iran and Venezuela exacerbate the 
differences and mistrust that Chavez is already provoking.  Latin 
America and our Foreign Ministry must clearly take a stance and set 
restrictions regarding Iran's diplomatic presence and offers of 
cooperation, and be aware of Iran's motivations."
