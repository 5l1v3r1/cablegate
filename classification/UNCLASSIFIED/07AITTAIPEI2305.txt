SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
¶1. Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage October 9 on Typhoon Krosa, which swept through the island 
over the weekend; on the military parade on Oct. 10, the first in 16 
years; and on DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh's absence from 
public appearances for the ten days. 
 
¶2. In terms of editorials and commentaries, an editorial in the 
pro-independence, English-language "Taipei Times" said Taiwan should 
shop elsewhere for its planned purchase of fighter jets. An op-ed in 
the same newspaper Oct. 8 claimed that recent remarks by U.S. 
officials opposing Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations suggested 
that there might be a secret deal between the U.S. and China. End 
summary. 
 
¶3. U.S.-Taiwan Relations 
 
A) "The F-16 Isn't the Only Bird in Town" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language "Taipei Times" [circulation: 
30,000] editorialized (10/9): 
 
"As China's military threat is not becoming any less severe, Taipei 
must find a way to pull itself out from this quandary.  The solution 
is fairly simple- shot elsewhere.  Luckily, there is no shortage of 
companies and states eager to sell weaponry to countries in need. 
 
"There would be other advantages to widening the list of potential 
defense contractors.  For one, increased competition means that 
prices would likely to down.  It would also diminish Taiwan's 
unhealthy reliance on the U.S. to meet its defense needs, which puts 
it at risk when, as now, politics have a detrimental impact on 
defense acquisitions. 
 
"In other words, by shopping around, Taiwan would prompt Beijing to 
make more belligerent demands with more countries -- perhaps 
alienating them in the process -- which could prove politically 
beneficial." 
 
B) "U.S. Choice: Principle or Realpolitik" 
 
Jerome Keating, a Taiwan-based commentator, opined in the "Taipei 
Times" [circulation: 30,000](10/8): 
 
"In effect, the unresolved status of the 23 million free and 
democratic people of Taiwan allows the U.S. to use Taiwan as a pawn, 
a bargaining chip in its dealings with China.  Is this going beyond 
realpolitik and leading to a betrayal of principles? 
 
"[Deputy Assistant Secretary of State] Christensen indicated that he 
believes that China has drawn a line in the sand over its 
interpretation of a spurious symbolic code and names.... 
 
"The rhetoric and tone Christensen uses indicate that yet another 
secret Kissinger-like deal exists between the U.S. and China.  This 
 
SIPDIS 
bears examination... 
 
"Taiwan is being asked to take responsibility for the hole that the 
U.S. has dug.  China's provocative assertions and claims over the 
democratic people of Taiwan and is provocative pile of missiles 
against Taiwan are more harmful to the 'status quo' and the peace 
and stability of the Taiwan Strait than any statements or actions 
made by Taiwan."
