EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT 
---------------------------- 
¶2. (U) AusAID, the Australian Government aid agency that has 
the lead in coordinating Australia's response to the May 27 
Indonesian earthquake, provided a May 31 update of 
Australia's response to the disaster.  AusAID assessed that 
the earthquake affected all districts of Yogyakarta and four 
districts of Central Java, with Bantul District of Yogyakarta 
and Klaten District of Central Java the hardest hit areas. 
The south and center of Yogyakarta city sustained significant 
structural damage.  In its report, AusAID noted that 
electricity had been restored in most of the affected areas, 
and the Yogyakarta airport had reopened, which would 
facilitate emergency response efforts.  The report updated 
the official death toll to 5,428 people, with up to 8,000 
injured and varying reports of between 100,000 and 200,000 
left homeless.  It noted that hospital and medical facilities 
had been overwhelmed. 
 
AUSTRALIAN RESPONSE 
------------------- 
¶3. (U) According to AusAID, on May 30 Australia increased to 
AUS$7.5 million (US$5.7 million) its commitment for critical 
humanitarian assistance to survivors of the earthquake.  This 
incorporated AUS$500,000 for the Indonesian Red Cross for 
medical teams, field hospitals, tents for displaced persons, 
field kitchens, medical supplies and equipment; and 
AUS$200,000 for orthopedic equipment.  The total aid package 
of AUS$7.5 million included: 
 
- $2.5 million for medical teams, equipment and consumables; 
 
- $0.5 million for engineering teams; 
 
- $4 million through UN and non-government organisations. 
This included assistance for emergency shelter and kitchens 
to feed quake victims; 
 
- $0.5 million for other needs as they were identified. 
 
¶4. (U) AusAID reported that a 27-person Australian medical 
team, led by an AusAID representative and comprising 
surgeons, anesthestists, operating staff, disaster medicine 
specialists and logisticians, arrived in Yogyakarta from 
Australia on May 31, accompanied by 12 tons of medical 
Quipment and supplies.  Previously, on May 30, Australia had 
mobilized a 15-member Indonesia-based medical team to 
commence emergency assessments and operations, and was 
providing medical, hospital and relief supplies, including 
AUS$200,00 of orthopedic instruments. 
 
¶5. (U) The Australian Government planned to send more than 80 
disaster experts to Yogyakarta as part of an expanded 
emergency response to Saturday's earthquake, including 
critical infrastructure and essential needs teams, comprising

engineers, electricians, water and sanitation experts, 
pharmacists, and logisticians. 
 
¶6. (U) AusAID staff, who had been on the ground in the 
affected areas since Saturday, were assessing needs, 
coordinating medical and other assistance and liaising with 
local authorities and the local and international media.  A 
nine-person AusAID advance deployment had arrived in 
Yogyakarta, including an Australian logistical adviser to 
assist the Government agencies in Yogyakarta. 
 
¶7. (U) An Australian consular response team had set up in the 
Yogyakarta Hyatt Hotel to assist Australian citizens.  AusAID 
reported that all Australians were accounted for, with no 
casualties reported, and thus the consular role was winding 
down. 
 
¶9. (U) Australia was providing funds and personnel through 
international aid agencies for relief needs, including 
funding to Muhammadiyah, an Indonesian NGO, as well as 
Australian NGOs and United Nations agencies to support 
medical and feeding programs in the worst affected areas.

¶10. (U) AusAID had identified as the most urgent needs 
medical supplies, medical and surgical support, food and 
non-food items, water and sanitation.  It noted that the 
Indonesian Government had encouraged international 
assistance, and had indicated a preference for assistance in 
the form of antibiotics, food for children, blankets and 
tents.
