Hunting Technology Ltd. (WHT), 61, Vyborgskaya Nab,

¶4. WHT was founded in 2001 with three employees as a 
wholesale distributor of hunting supplies.  The 
company now employs nine and specializes in imports of 
hunting and outdoors supplies from the United States 
and Europe for the Russian market.  WHT maintains 
exclusive distribution agreements with hunting

& Kellerman Weather Systems (USA).  The company has 
its offices and warehouse at a commercial office and

simulate hunting conditions.  The majority of the

electronic security system with remote notification to

equipment are controlled by the GOR, and retailers are 
required to meet strict security regulations regarding 
storage and inventory control.  Sales for export are 
prohibited without proper permits from the GOR.

Technology Ltd., St. Petersburg, Russia, as reliable 
recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is 
Qquested that post be notified of final disposition 
of the application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS
