Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of 
the Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), accompanied by Commercial 
Assistant, Sandy Lai, conducted a pre-license check 
(PLC) at the Vegetable Marketing Organization 
(VMO)757 Lai Chi Kok Road, Cheung Shawan, Kowloon, 
Hong Kong.  The purpose of the PLC was to determine 
the suitability of VMO to be the recipient of virtual 
private network software.  The item (ECCN 5A002) is 
valued at approximately USD $143,000 and is 
controlled for national security (NS) reasons.  The 
license applicant is F5 Networks, Inc. of Seattle, 
Washington. 
 
¶3.  The VMO is a self-financing, non-profit entity 
originally set up to assist in the post-war 
rehabilitation of local farming and to provide 
facilities for marketing of vegetables.  Presently, 
the VMO operates a wholesale vegetable market at the 
address referenced above.  While the VMO is 
independent from the Hong Kong government, its 
director is the Director of the Hong Kong Department 
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation. 
 
¶4.  On February 9, 2006, the ECO and Commercial 
Assistant visited VMO at the address above and met 
with Mr. Ka Kit Au, Market Manager (Development). Mr. 
Au described the wholesale market business of VMO, 
where the software will be used.  In particular, the 
VMO's wholesale market acts as broker in nearly 50% 
of all wholesale vegetable trades in Hong Kong and 
clears 50,000-60,000 transactions per day.  The 
facility itself is located in one square block.  The 
information Mr. u provided is consistent with the 
information onthe VMO web site: www.vmo.org.  Other 
backgroundinformation may be found at this web site 
as wel. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Au stated that VMO would like to purchse the 
VPU software so that it can join three neworks that 
presently exist both within the facilty itself and 
at one location nearby.  Mr. Au stated that a tender 
process for this item and related items is presently 
under way and VMO has not yet chosen a final vendor. 
 
¶6.  VMO was very forthcoming during the PLC visit. 
Mr. Lee provided information on the underlying 
transaction and VMO's intent to use the item for its 
operations in Hong Kong.  The ECO recommends that 
this PLC be considered Favorable.
