SUBJECT: BEST WISHES AND PENDING ISSUE 
 
 
¶1.  I was saddened to hear of the President' acceptance of 
your resignation.  The Administration is losing one of its 
most effective leaders.  Thank you for your tireless efforts 
to further the President's Economic Program. 
 
¶2.  Please accept my best wishes as you return to your family 
in Texas.  I too am leaving public service to return home.  I 
hope our paths cross again soon. 
 
¶3.  One item of pending business.  I phoned you on Monday 
about BIS license approval of non-sensitive GE spare parts 
for a power plant in Syria.  Please advise who within 
Commerce we should follow-up with on this important issue. 
 
¶4.  All the best in your future endeavors.
