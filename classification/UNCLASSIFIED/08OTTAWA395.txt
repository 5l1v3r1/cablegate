SUBJECT:  CANADIAN RECOGNITION OF KOSOVO 
 
REF:  OTTAWA 0392 
 
¶1.  (U)  In a statement on March 18, Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier 
announced Canada's recognition that Kosovo's independence was now an 
"international reality," without being a precedent (reftel).  Full 
statement in para 3. 
 
¶2.  (U)  The Serbian Ambassador to Ottawa told the media on March 18 
that his government, in reaction, had ordered his recall.  He warned 
publicly that "separatism is dangerous." 
 
¶3.  (U)  Begin statement by Minister Bernier: 
 
We note that a significant number of countries, including our G7 
partners and many of Canada's close allies, have already recognized 
Kosovo. 
 
Kosovo is a unique case, as illustrated by its recent history 
characterized by war and ethnic cleansing, the role subsequently 
played by the United Nations and NATO in administering the territory 
and providing for its security, and the ongoing role that 
international organizations such as the European Union will play in 
assisting Kosovo with its transition to full independence. 
 
As the declaration issued by Kosovo's parliament also makes clear, 
the unique circumstances which have led to Kosovo's independence 
mean it does not constitute any kind of precedent.  Statements made 
by other countries recognizing Kosovo's independence have echoed 
this point. 
 
We welcome the commitment made by Kosovo to ensure the protection of 
the rights of Serbian and other minorities, including their right to 
safety.  Canada also welcomes Kosovo's commitment to ensure the 
protection of religious and cultural heritage sites.  Canada 
attaches great importance to the full implementation of these and 
other commitments, undertaken by Kosovo's leaders in line with the 
recommendations of UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari. 
 
The development of Kosovo into a democratic, multi-ethnic state that 
fully respects human rights is essential for peace, political 
stability and economic progress in the Balkans. 
 
In this context, Canada acknowledges this new international 
reality.
