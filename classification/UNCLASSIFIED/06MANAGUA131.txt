¶A. Jadia Y. Lopez, FSN grade 10 
¶B. DOB: February 10, 1979 
¶C. Nationality: Nicaraguan 
¶D. Passport Number: COP47736 
¶E. Agency: State, US Embassy Managua 
¶F. Position Title: Economic Specialist 
¶G. American Supervisor's name and email address: Mark W. 
Cullinane, cullinanemw@state.gov 
¶H. FSN's education, experience and current responsibilities: 
      
a. Education: (MBA) INCAE Business School, Managua; 
(Engineering Degree) Universidad America, Managua 
      
b. Job experience:  Ms. Lopez has worked with the World 
Bank and contributed to the evaluation of CAFTA-DR impact in 
Nicaragua by analyzing statistical data.  As a consultant for 
the Interamerican Institute for Cooperation in Agriculture, 
she developed economic models related to budget and strategic 
planning that are currently being applied within the 
Nicaraguan government.  She was also responsible for 
analyzing Nicaragua's macroeconomic performance, as well as 
data on agricultural production and consumption.  She also 
analyzed the economic performance data of other Latin 
American countries. 
     
c. Current Responsibilities: Ms. Lopez supports the Economic Section primarily by researching and analyzing the impact of proposed legislation and laws on trade, investment, fiscal stability and macroeconomic performance. She reviews and presents economic performance data, and makes recommendations regularly on economic policies or commercial issues requiring Embassy attention. In fulfillment of these responsibilities, Ms. Lopez maintains excellent contact with technical and policy analysts throughout the GON, as well as business association and industry representatives. I. Description of how the course would enhance nominee's productivity at post: PE220 Economic Training: Ms. Lopez's core job responsibilities include economic data analysis and consultations on macroeconomic, fiscal and trade policy. Understanding the World Bank and IMF policy reform approaches is very important, especially in a country in which the fiscal, monetary and macroeconomic policy is closely tied to these international financial institutions. Further, a proper understanding of trade, exchange rate, monetary and fiscal policy would enhance Ms. Lopez' capacity to propose strategies for economic growth. Finally, Ms. Lopez' reporting skills would be enhanced by an explanation of the preferences of her Washington audience. PE222 Trade Agreement Monitoring and Implementation: the trade course would provide especially timely information to Ms. Lopez, as Nicaraguan is weeks away from entry into force of CAFTA-DR. Consequently, training in obligations on customs, trade quotas, standards, IPR and procurement would be put to immediate use. This training would also form a helpful backdrop for analysis of Nicaragua's participation in the Central American Customs Union and its WTO obligations.
