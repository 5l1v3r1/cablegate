STATEMENT 
 
 
¶1. LAST WEEK'S JOINT STATEMENT BY THE HEADS OF 
ZIMBABWE'S DEFENSE AND SECURITY FORCES, DECLARING THAT 
THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT ANYONE WITHOUT CREDIBLE LIBERATION 
CREDENTIALS, RECEIVED CONTRASTING EDITORIAL COMMENTS IN 
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA.  WHILE THE INDEPENDENT PRESS 
CONDEMNED THE STATEMENT AS "OUTRIGHT TREASON" OR A "DE 
FACTO COUP," THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PRINT AND 
ELECTRONIC PRESS PRAISED THE STATEMENT.  EXCERPTS 
FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   UNDER HEADLINE "SERVICE CHIEFS' STANCE WELCOME," 
    THE JANUARY 13 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED 
    WEEKLY "THE SUNDAY MAIL" COMMENTS: 
 
    ". . .THAT STATEMENT WAS OVERDUE AND WE 
    CONGRATULATE THE ARMY AND SECURITY CHIEFS ON 
    HAVING THE FORESIGHT TO SPELL OUT THE VALUES THAT 
    SHOULD DETERMINE THE PRESIDENT AND FUTURE 
    LEADERSHIP IN ZIMBABWE.  EACH COUNTRY HAS SUCH 
    VALUES, BELIEFS AND TRADITIONS, WHICH ARE 
    SACROSANCT. . .  THIS IS VERY TRUE OF THE ONLY 
    SUPERPOWER, THE UNITED STATES.  ANY ASPIRANT TO 
    THE PRESIDENCY OF THE U.S. HAS TO BE PREPARED TO 
    CHAMPION THE CAUSE OF GEORGE WASHINGTON AND THE 
    LEADERS OF YORE.  HE OR SHE IS NOT ALLOWED TO SEEK 
    A REVERSAL OF THOSE VALUES AND TRADITIONS BUT 
    THEIR FURTHERANCE.  HIS OR HER CREDENTIALS IN ANY 
    WARS FOUGHT BY AMERICA DURING HIS LIFETIME ARE 
    CAREFULLY EXAMINED FOR HE IS EXPECTED TO DEFEND 
    THAT COUNTRY AGAINST FOREIGN AGGRESSION. . . 
    THUS, THE GENERALS ARE RIGHT IN SAYING THE 
    POTENTIAL OCCUPANT OF THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  00139  141501Z 
    LAND MUST BELIEVE IN THOSE VALUES. . . ." 
 
¶3.   UNDER HEADLINE "ZVINAVASHE IS NOT GOD," THE 
    JANUARY 13 EDITION OF THE INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE 
    STANDARD" COMMENTS: 
 
    "CONTRARY TO WHAT HE MAY THINK OF HIMSELF, OR 
    WHATEVER HE MAY HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE BY HIS 
    COMPATRIOTS IN ZANU PF, GENERAL VITALIS 
    ZVINAVASHE. . .NEEDS TO BE DISABUSED OF THE 
    THINKING THAT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY AND 
    PEOPLE IS A MATTER OF HIS PERSONAL DISCRETION. . . 
    ZVINAVASHE. . .MADE AN UNPRECEDENTED AND SHOCKING 
    STATEMENT TO THE NATION THAT THE NATIONAL DEFENSE 
    AND SECURITY FORCES WOULD NOT ACCEPT A PRESIDENT 
    WHO DOES NOT SUIT THEIR REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS 
    POSSESSING CREDIBLE LIBERATION WAR CREDENTIALS. . 
    .  WE URGE ZIMBABWEANS TO IGNORE WITH THE CONTEMPT 
    THAT IT DESERVES THE STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE 
    SERVICE CHIEFS THIS WEEK.  ZIMBABWEANS MUST LEARN 
    TO STAND UP AND SAY 'NO' TO BULLY BOY TACTICS..." 
 
¶4.   UNDER HEADLINE "WHAT DOES TSVANGIRAI FEAR?," THE 
    JANUARY 12 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY 
    "THE HERALD" COMMENTS: 
 
    "THE SECURITY FORCES' STATEMENT ON THE FORTHCOMING 
    PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. . .AS EXPECTED. . .WAS 
    TWISTED TO IMPLY THAT THE ARMY HAD DISQUALIFIED 
    THE OPPOSITION'S MDC (MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC 
    CHANGE) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, MR. MORGAN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  00139  141501Z 
    TSVANGIRAI, FROM CONTESTING THE ELECTION, ON THE 
    ALLEGED BASIS THAT HE DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE 
    LIBERATION STRUGGLE.  AT NO POINT DID THE GENERALS 
    DISQUALIFY ANYONE, LET ALONE NAME MR. TSVANGIRAI, 
    OR EVEN SUGGEST THAT ONLY CANDIDATES WITH 
    LIBERATION STRUGGLE CREDENTIALS WOULD BE 
    RECOGNIZED BY THE MILITARY AND SECURITY FORCES. 
    WHAT THE GENERALS STATED EXPLICITLY WAS THAT THEY 
    WILL NOT ACCEPT ANYONE WHOSE AGENDA THREATENS TO 
    REVERSE THE GAINS OF THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE.  'WE 
    WILL NOT ACCEPT, LET ALONE SUPPORT OR SALUTE, 
    ANYONE WITH AN AGENDA THAT THREATENS THE EVERY 
    EXISTENCE OF OUR SOVEREIGNTY, OUR COUNTRY AND OUR 
    PEOPLE.'  WHAT COULD BE MORE CLEAR THAN THAT...? 
    THE HYSTERICAL REACTION MADE BY THE OPPOSITION 
    PARTY AND ITS WESTERN BACKERS CONFIRMS THE REAL 
    FEARS THAT THE GENERALS HAVE ABOUT ZIMBABWE'S 
    FUTURE. . ."
