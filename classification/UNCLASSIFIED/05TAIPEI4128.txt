¶1.  In response to an alert issued by the World Health 
Organization (WHO), the Taiwan Center for Disease Control 
(TCDC) announced on October 6 new screening requirements for 
Avian Influenza.  Beginning October 10, all passengers on 
flights from Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Cambodia will 
be asked to monitor their body temperature for the first ten 
days upon arrival in Taiwan.  Visitors will be asked to take 
their temperature twice a day and record it on a form 
provided at the airport.  TCDC is asking that any passenger 
that experiences a fever over 38 degrees centigrade within 
ten days of arriving in Taiwan should wear a mask and see a 
doctor immediately.  Any inbound passenger from these four 
countries arriving at a Taiwan airport with a fever over 38 
degrees centigrade will be interviewed by quarantine 
personnel and asked to complete a "Communicable Disease 
Survey Form." 
 
¶2.  Any passenger that fails to inform the health authorities 
and transmits Avian Influenza to others will be subject to a 
fine between NT$ 3,000 (US$90) and NT$ 15,000 (US$450).
