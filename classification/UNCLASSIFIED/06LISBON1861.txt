Summary: 
¶1. (U) The Portuguese Superior Council on National Defense 
(CSDN) held an extraordinary session on August 29 and 
unanimously voted to send an Army Engineering and 
Construction Company with up to 140 personnel in mid-October 
to support UNIFIL.  During the same meeting, the CSDN also 
announced the possible reduction of troops in Bosnia and the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) The Superior Council on National Defense, presided by 
President Cavaco Silva, held an extraordinary session August 
29 to decide the composition of Portugal's contribution to 
UNIFIL.  Basing its decision on operational relevancy, risk, 
and cost, the CSDN unanimously elected to deploy to southern 
Lebanon an Army Engineering unit rather than a frigate, 
helicopters, or mechanized Army unit as suggested by press 
reports.  The GOP estimates the mission will cost 9.3 million 
euros, 70 percent of which would be supported by the United 
Nations.  The DAO confirmed with the Ministry of Defense that 
the Engineering unit will integrate into UNIFIL's third phase 
in mid- October to rehabilitate destroyed infrastructure. 
The Spanish daily El Pas reported on August 31 that the 
Portuguese will be under Spanish command, but the DAO has not 
yet been able to confirm this with the Ministry of Defense. 
 
 
¶3. (U) During the same meeting, the CSDN announced the 
possible reduction of troops in Bosnia and the DRC but stated 
that this was separate from their decision to contribute to 
UNIFIL.  Currently, Portugal has 49 marines in the DRC and 
two infantry companies in Bosnia.  The GOP had already 
started discussion in May 2006 to downsize their presence in 
Bosnia by one company.  Any troop reductions would occur at 
the end of the year or the beginning of next year. 
 
¶4. (U) Comment:  Portugal indicated early on that it wanted 
to contribute to UNIFIL but had been waiting for 
clarification of the mission mandate (reftel).  The August 25 
EU Meeting on UNIFIL helped solidify thoughts on what kind of 
military assistance Portugal could provide.  The Portuguese 
view their selection of an engineering unit as a low- cost, 
moderate-risk, high-visibility contribution to UNIFIL.  This 
decision reflects Portugal's desire to play a greater role in 
the Middle East despite limited financial resources.  While 
the decision to reduce troops in Bosnia and the DRC occurred 
during the same Council meeting, these reductions had been 
discussed well before the Lebanon crisis.
