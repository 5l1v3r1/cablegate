SUBJECT: NINEWA PRT: PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT REACHES OUT TO ITS 
CONSTITUENTS

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. In an effort to bring the provincial government into closer 
contact with district constituents, PRT Ninewa and MNF-N have 
provided logistical support for the Ninewa provincial council to 
conduct a series of outreach events throughout Ninewa province. 
The provincial leadership held town meetings in Sinjar, 
Quyarrah, Tal Afar, Makhmour and Telkaif during April and May. 
Turnout has been high, with crowds of approximately 130 persons 
at each event.  The impetus for the outreach events came from a 
meeting provincial government officials had with MNF-N and the 
PRT in March, where Governor Duraid Kashmoula said he and his 
colleagues wanted to visit more remote parts of the province but 
did not have the means to do so.  The "town hall"-style meetings 
allowed mayors, tribal leaders, and city and district councils a 
chance to meet provincial officials from Mosul and discuss 
issues affecting their areas and how the provincial government 
could help.  Overall, provincial government and PRT 
representatives believe the events have been a rousing success: 
they have focused provincial and district leaders alike on 
concrete tasks and challenges.  End Summary.

DISTRICT OUTREACH EVENTS DEEMED A SUCCESS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. Provincial government district outreach events were open to 
the public.  Topics of discussion ranged from national issues, 
such as security and stability, to those affecting local 
officials and their constituents, such as aid to farmers. 
Inevitably, security was the headline issue, with district 
officials and constituents expressing concern about terrorism 
and the need for better protection from Iraqi Security Forces 
(ISF).  Services (especially clean water, garbage collection, 
and electricity) were also high priorities, with agricultural 
areas concerned about having enough fuel, for instance, to do 
their work.  Local issues were also discussed, such as the need 
for a sewage system in Telkaif District.  Provincial Council 
Chair Salem Hajj Issa and Vice Governor Khasro Goran attended 
all outreach events.  Governor Duraid Kashmoula attended the 
events up to May 14 when he left Iraq for hip surgery in Turkey. 
 Provincial leaders spoke effectively about the need to address 
issues and to work for improvement of all segments of society in 
Ninewa regardless of religious or ethic background.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶3. The willingness of provincial officials to engage in outreach 
events in areas outside Mosul indicates a growing awareness of 
their need to have a more responsive and transparent government 
if they want to be considered legitimate by the citizens of 
Ninewa.  Given the Kurdish domination of the provincial 
government (the Governor, Vice Governor, Council Speaker and 31 
of 41 Council members represent the Kurdish list) there is a 
natural skepticism among the population that the interests of 
Shias, Sunnis, Christians and other minorities are not of 
concern to the government.  The effort of the government leaders 
to reach out to these groups and to listen to their concerns is 
a first step toward overcoming this skepticism and demonstrating 
that the provincial government is genuinely concerned about all 
the residents of the province no matter their religion, tribe or 
ethnic group.
