  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. IRAN 
 
"Why was the U.S.-Iran Badminton Diplomacy abolished?" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao) (02/10): "The U.S.-Iran Badminton diplomacy, amid 
high expectations, has failed. This has disappointed Obama, as he is 
dedicated to improving the relationship. Obama has even admitted his 
Islamic background. Only with Iran's help, can the U.S. continue its 
influence in the Persian Gulf. Although Obama was willing to improve 
relations with Iran, Iran does not trust Obama enough to do so. 
What's more important, unresolvable conflicts on the nuclear issue 
exist between the U.S. and Iran. And Obama has not yet given in on 
the issue. If the U.S. does not give-in on this issue, it is 
impossible for Badminton Diplomacy to happen. Iran refused to admit 
that the U.S.' Badminton Diplomacy true intention is to add more 
future chips to their negotiations with the U.S." 
 
¶2. U.S. POLICY 
 
"The U.S. will not adopt trade protectionism" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao) (02/10): "In the agreement between the Congress 
and the Senate, the 'Buy American' bill has been canceled and 
replaced by a softened and revised plan. It regulates that when the 
U.S. doesn't disobey its duties in various international pacts, it 
still can operate under the bill. Once more, other items in the 
stimulus plan have revealed the inclination towards U.S. 
protectionism. However, it is unlikely that the U.S. will utilize 
large scale trade protectionism because the position of the U.S. 
dollar will be seriously stricken if the U.S. proceeds with 
protectionism. A global trade war will be inevitable and the 
international currency reserves will dramatically drop. However, 
some regional currency will rise. The international financial system 
led by the U.S. dollar would be changed. The U.S. is considering 
protectionism because it wants to deter its trade partners from 
gaining an advantage." 
 
¶3. JAPAN 
 
"Improved U.S.-China relations make Japan uneasy" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao) (02/10): "Secretary Clinton has decided to visit 
Japan first during her Asia visit in order to pacify Japan. The 
Japanese media has expressed their complicated psychology concerning 
the U.S.-China relationship becoming closer. Some Japanese experts 
believe that Secretary Clinton's first stop being Japan is not 
simply to pacify Japan; she is visiting not because Japan is 
important, but because Japan is geographically closer to the U.S. 
Whether the U.S. still emphasizes Japan depends on the result of 
Secretary Clinton's Japan visit. However, what Japan worries most 
about is Secretary Clinton's husband. Former President Bill Clinton 
has had an unusually close relationship with China. This fact will 
likely make the Obama administration incline towards China 
diplomatically. Hopefully the Obama administration will become a 
Clinton style pro-China government."
