¶1. Econoff delivered reftel demarche to Marta Blanco, Deputy 
Director General for EU Trade Policy, and Isabel Pastor, 
Advisor for EU Trade Policy, at the Ministry of Industry, 
Tourism and Trade. 
 
¶2. As this was an initial meeting - Blanco is new to her 
position, having replaced longtime Deputy Director Inigo 
Febrel in September - Blanco took the opportunity to provide 
an overview of Spanish trade policy and GOS aspirations in 
the area of trade for its EU presidency in the first half of 
¶2010.  She said Spain remains keenly interested in reaching 
agreement on outstanding Doha issues as a way to generate 
confidence in international markets and create new business 
opportunities to help the global economy recover.  The GOS 
has high hopes that progress can be made at the upcoming WTO 
Ministerial, creating momentum that can lead to important 
achievements in early 2010.  Minister of Industry, Tourism, 
and Trade Miguel Sebastian will lead Spain's delegation to 
the Ministerial, and Blanco asked who will represent the 
United States.  She stressed the GOS' interest in more 
bilateral contacts, which she said will contribute to 
transparency and help bring about a convergence on the issues. 
 
¶3. In response to the demarche, Blanco stated that a binding 
registry for geographical indications (GI) and GI extension 
are key priorities for Spain in the Doha Round.  She 
acknowledged that negotiation of patent disclosure rules, 
though not specifically related to the GI issues, is 
mentioned in the same document and represents the European 
Commission-Swiss position.  However, she indicated that the 
GOS had less interest in this TRIPS/CBD matter than in GI. 
She took on board Econoff's explanation of why the U.S. does 
not support amending TRIPS to add a disclosure requirement. 
At the same time, she expressed disappointment that our 
positions were so far apart on the question of the GI 
registry and GI extension, even while holding out hope that 
we might still find common ground.  Econoff agreed this was 
desirable but cautioned against unrealistic expectations of a 
change in the U.S. position. 
 
¶4. Blanco stated that strengthening bilateral relations with 
the United States is a high priority for Spain's EU 
Presidency and that Spain sees the Transatlantic Economic 
Council (TEC) as an important vehicle for achieving that 
goal.  She noted that during Spain's presidency, the EU will 
also hold high-level meetings with Canada, Russia, Central 
American countries, Andean countries, and North African 
countries, and will try to move the Mediterranean process 
forward.  Among trade issues Spain would particularly like to 
see results on during its EU presidency, she listed the 
Boeing-Airbus dispute and ACTA negotiations. 
 
¶5. Comment: While Blanco was receptive to our Doha Round 
message that the parties should focus their efforts on 
achieving better market access for agriculture and NAMA, she 
gave no indication that Spain was prepared to reconsider its 
strongly-held position on the binding GI registry and GI 
extension.  End Comment.
