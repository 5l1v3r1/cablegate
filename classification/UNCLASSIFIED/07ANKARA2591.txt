In Today's Papers 
 
Iraqi Foreign Minister Zebari Calls for the PKK to Leave Iraq 
All papers report international wire services quote Iraqi Foreign 
Minister Zebari as urging the PKK to "leave Iraqi territories at 
once" and not to bring more problems.  Zebari said the Turkish 
Parliament's cross-border operations authorization was "like a sword 
hanging over the head of Iraq."  Mainstream Hurriyet says Zebari's 
statement came after a meeting of Turkish Ambassador in Baghdad 
Derya Kanbay, US Ambassador Ryan Crocker, and Iraqi security 
minister Shirwan al-Waili.  Zebari also said he does not expect a 
major offensive by the Turkish army into northern Iraq soon, but air 
attacks against the PKK bases are possible. 
 
On the other hand, papers report Turkish troops near the Iraqi 
border, especially around Sirnak province, are readying for an 
operation.  The land forces commander General Ilker Basbug is 
inspecting the troops.  Tabloid Aksam claims US helicopters were 
conducting reconnaissance flights between the border and the town of 
Zaho. 
 
Papers also report peaceful protest demonstrations against a Turkish 
attack were held in the towns of Erbil and Dohuk in northern Iraq 
with demonstrators calling on Turkey to resolve the PKK problem "at 
home." 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkish Iraq Incursion 
Taha Akyol comments in the mainstream Milliyet:  "The armed struggle 
and cross-border operations against the PKK are not wrong but, while 
we are pursuing the military struggle, we should also be thinking of 
ways to prevent people from joining the PKK.  That is the main 
issue, otherwise, even though more terrorists are killed, new ones 
will replace them immediately.  Every incident escalating Turk-Kurd 
tension is feeding the political, social and physiologic factors of 
the PKK.  Hostile remarks made with nationalist sentiments hurt our 
innocent Kurdish-origin citizens and encourage ethnic divisions. 
The solution to countering terrorism lies with the economy, 
democracy and the state's armed struggle against terror." 
 
Hasan Mesut Hazar writes in the conservative-nationalist Turkiye: 
"After waiting for a long time for the US and Iraq to take some 
concrete steps against the PKK and showing great patience, Turkey 
decided to take this decision [passing the parliamentary motion for 
a cross-border operation].  Now, Turkey is asking the US to choose 
between Turkey and the Kurds in Northern Iraq.  Is asking the US to 
choose the right approach?  Aren't we wrong by not talking to 
Barzani, who fought against the PKK in the past together with Turks? 
 Why would it be wrong for Turkey to form its Iraq and Middle East 
policies by remaining friends with the Kurdish administration in 
northern Iraq?  Turkey should take actions with common sense and 
consider having direct dialogue with the Kurdish leaders in northern 
Iraq." 
 
Armenian Genocide Resolution in Congress 
All papers report US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was "reconsidering" 
her pledge to force a vote on the Armenian genocide resolution, and 
that the US media believes approval of the resolution by the House 
is unlikely.  In a letter to Pelosi, 49 representatives asked for 
the blockade of the resolution.  Mainstream Sabah quotes US 
Representative Robert Wexler as saying the resolution would hardly 
be approved by the House.  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak comments 
that US lawmakers pulled back support for the resolution due to 
Turkey's determination in passing a critical motion for a 
cross-border operation against the PKK in Iraq.  Meanwhile, in 
Ankara, Turkish Ambassador to Washington Nabi Sensoy told members of 
the Turkish Parliament's foreign affairs commission that the 
resolution will not be approved.  Sensoy said he will go back to 
Washington on Sunday. 
 
Kurdish Politicians under Investigation 
 
ANKARA 00002591  002 OF 002 
 
 
Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, Yeni Safak and others report 
Turkey's Council of State (Danistay) has approved an earlier 
decision of the Interior Ministry to sack Abdullah Demirbas, the 
mayor of Sur, a town in Diyarbakir province, for providing 
municipality services in Kurdish.  Liberal Radikal reports a lawsuit 
-- the fourth in three days -- has been filed against Diyarbakir 
Mayor Osman Baydemir for making a statement to the press that his 
municipality was not given its share from the national budget.  The 
prosecutor said Baydemir's public statement "instigates hate and 
enmity and jeopardizes public safety," asking for 4.5 years in 
prison for the mayor.  The Diyarbakir prosecutor has also asked for 
the revoking of parliamentary immunity of the pro-Kurdish DTP 
lawmaker Aysel Tugluk for a speech she delivered in Diyarbakir in 
July.  Prosecutor asks for five years in prison for Tugluk. 
 
Turkey to Hold Referendum on Constitutional Reforms 
All papers report Turkey will go to a referendum on constitutional 
reforms on October 21. The referendum calls for general elections 
once in every four years instead of five, the president to be 
elected by popular vote, and the presidential term to be reduced 
from the current seven years to five with a second term in office. 
The ruling AKP and pro-Kurdish DTP support the vote whereas 
opposition CHP and MHP called for a rejection.
