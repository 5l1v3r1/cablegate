¶1. U.S. DIPLOMACY 
 
"Smart Power, 3Ds, and soft diplomacy" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) (06/10): 
"After Obama took office, he successively visited the American 
States, Europe and the Middle East.  In this way, he manifests an 
obvious difference between himself and the former president in 
diplomatic concepts, strategy and style.  He brings forward smart 
power and the 3Ds.  The 3Ds are diplomacy, development, and defense. 
 Obama believes that no matter how powerful a country is, relying on 
the military only will not bring success to the country.  Discarding 
the former President's unilateralism and 'friend or enemy' attitude, 
Obama advocates reaching the broadest partnerships with the world. 
The U.S. partnership includes three phrases: strengthening 
traditional allies with Europe and Asia; deepening relations with 
countries with regional influence; combining 'frank and 
constructive' relations with China and Russia, the two countries 
with international influence; and finally, effectively using 
international organizations.  Obama has focused on the task of 
improving relations with the Muslim world.  His recent speech in 
Cairo has stated his main policies on major issues concerning the 
Muslim world's interests.  It is also a manifestation of Obama's 
soft diplomatic style: modest and self-introspective, admitting the 
U.S. is wrong and expressing willingness to listen and learn. 
Obama's modest diplomatic style has softened the hegemonic image of 
the U.S.; this, to a certain extent, fixes the U.S.' foreign 
relationships.  The world is watching for the next action of the 
U.S." 
 
¶2. NORTH KOREA 
 
"The U.S. ardently asks North Korea to forgive the female 
reporters" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/10): "The Obama administration is unable 
to see that this development will restrict its North Korean policy. 
The plight of the two female reporters has aroused great sympathy 
with the American public.  Secretary Clinton entreated North Korea 
to forgive the two reporters during a press conference on June 8th. 
This is the first time, since May 25th, that the U.S. has lowered 
their stance towards North Korea.  There is not a war-like 
atmosphere in Pyongyang.  The world predicts North Korea's next 
steps and the bottom line of the endurance of the U.S.  Washington's 
bottom line is that North Korea cannot transfer nuclear materials 
and nuclear facilities to third party countries.  If Pyongyang does 
this, the U.S. will seriously consider taking military action. 
Chinese experts indicate that China will not intercept North Korea's 
missiles along with the U.S.  China opposes North Korea's 
development of nuclear weapons, and opposes intercepting North 
Korea's missiles. This move will only complicate the situation and 
will not stabilize the regional situation."
