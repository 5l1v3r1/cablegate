  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  SECRETARY CLINTON IN AFRICA 
 
"Hillary Clinton's Africa visit did not meet her ambitions" 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing) (08/07): "In the twenty-first century, 
the United States needs Africa more than Africa needs the United 
States.  The U.S. not only needs Africa's natural resources and 
energy, but also Africa's political support.  African leaders 
understand this.  The U.S. cannot improve its relations with African 
countries unless its policies lead to tangible results.  However, 
the U.S. economy is facing many challenges due to the financial 
crisis.  Under these circumstances, it is difficult for the U.S. to 
take substantive measures to promote economic and social development 
in Africa.  Hillary Clinton's Africa visit had a more symbolic than 
practical meaning." 
 
¶2.  U.S.-CHINA 
 
"The U.S. and India want to use Nepal to attack China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (08/07): "Under the current circumstances, 
claiming [the U.S. and India want to use Nepal to attack China] 
might seem a little too farfetched, but it is not entirely 
groundless.  It reflects the U.S.-India strategy to contain China by 
using Nepal.  India regards itself as the 'boss' of South Asia.  It 
has been using its religious and economic advantages to contain 
other countries in the region, and asked Nepal to sign an unequal 
transit transportation agreement.  India regards China as a huge 
potential threat.  Nepal's geographic position is very important to 
both China and India.  Therefore, since the Communist Party of Nepal 
gained power, India's concerns about Nepal's pro-China policy have 
risen.  Now is the prime time for separatist forces in China and 
international anti-China forces to plot together against China. 
China should be vigilant against this phenomenon." 
 
¶3.  NORTH KOREA 
 
"Kim Jong Il smiled but Bill Clinton did not" 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated with the 
official Communist Youth League's China Youth Daily (08/07): "The 
likelihood of an interaction between North Korea and the U.S. is 
still unclear.  The two countries have different expectations, and 
the tensions between them have not been fundamentally eased.  If 
both parties cannot approach future bilateral relations from a 
strategic point of view, the accumulated hostility between the two 
countries' governments and their peoples will lead U.S.-North Korean 
relations into a cycle of 'confrontation - crisis - negotiation - 
cooperation - confrontation.'  North Korea is in a passive position 
in the bilateral interaction.  For the United States, the situation 
on the Korean Peninsula is still within its control and will not 
pose a significant threat to its core interests.  Therefore, the 
U.S. will not easily agree to North Korea's requests.  We cannot 
rule out the possibility of a resumption of the Six-Party Talks if 
North Korea decides to return to the Talks.  After all, with its 
multilateral nature, the Six-Party Talks is a good mechanism for 
North Korea to achieve its interests.  Bill Clinton's visit to North 
Korea is still significant.  First, it showed that there is still 
room for North Korea and the U.S. to improve their bilateral 
relations.  The diplomatic and mediation channels needed to address 
the issues between the two countries are still there.  Second, the 
U.S. achieved a tangible result while the North Koreans saved face. 
Third, by conducting 'former president diplomacy' and 'people's 
diplomacy,' the U.S. showed us that senior politicians, in their 
private capacity, can play an important role in breaking an impasse 
and achieving a magic outcome.  It also showed that the Obama 
administration is really good at the use of smart power."
