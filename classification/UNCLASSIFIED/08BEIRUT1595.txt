The Honorable Barack Obama 
President-elect of the United States of America 
 
Dear President-elect Obama, 
 
On behalf of the Lebanese people and the Democracy Movement 
in Lebanon I would like to congratulate you on this historic 
achievement for the American people in winning the elections 
and becoming the 44th president of the United States of 
America.  This vote of confidence by the American people is a 
testament to the greatness of this nation and its people who 
never fail to amaze and inspire the world with their courage, 
resilience, and goodness.  We, who look up to this beacon of 
freedom and liberty from around the world wish you and your 
great country success in this new endeavor and responsibility 
to keep America as it has always been throughout its history, 
the city on the Hill, a place for hope, justice, compassion 
and dignity for all.  To keep it a place, as you eloquently 
said, where dreams come true especially if they are dreams of 
the best that humanity can promise, dreams of freedom and 
liberty to all people regardless of their origin, color or 
faith. 
 
I am sure that under your visionary leadership people who are 
seeking support to live in peace and security will find in 
you a helping hand to fulfill their dream to  live in a world 
free of want and free of fear as one of your great presidents 
once dreamed so they may find their voices that will set them 
free. 
 
Again Mr. Obama please accept my best wishes for great 
success in your new mission and may God the merciful guide 
you and be always with you. 
 
Sincerely, 
/s/ Saad Rafic Hariri 
 
Beirut, November 5, 2008
