SUBJECT: TFGG01:  SOUTH OSSETIA, ABKHAZIA LEADERS SEEK 
INDEPENDENCE AND RUSSIAN GUARANTEES AGAINST GEORGIA 
 
(U)  Summary.  In an August 14 press conference in Moscow, 
South Ossetia leader Eduard Kokoity and Abkhazia leader 
Sergey Bagapsh declared their intentions to work with Russia 
towards seeking international recognition of their 
independence, in accordance with international law, but 
stressed they were not asking for immediate recognition by 
Russia.  They confirmed that they would negotiate under the 
6-point plan proposed by France, but only with Russian 
guarantees and reconsideration of previous security zone 
boundaries.  They said Western countries were morally 
responsible for Georgia's aggressions on South Ossetia, both 
because of their military support and because of the biased 
media reporting on the conflict.  End summary. 
 
Independence Under International Law 
------------------------------------ 
 
(U)  Bagapsh said that the two nations would seek recognition 
of their independence under international law.  He announced 
that on August 15, "Foreign Ministers" of Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia would travel to Moscow to coordinate efforts with 
Russia and discuss the next steps in gaining recognition. 
Both leaders said that their main obstacles would be dual 
standards and a lack of understanding from Western countries. 
 Bagapsh insisted that "the two republics are not a threat to 
Georgia's territorial integrity anymore," and in fact the two 
regions will support Georgia's territorial integrity in the 
future (but without them).  He also stressed that if dialogue 
on the two region's self-determination was possible before 
Georgia's attack, now it was not possible at all, saying that 
"only the nations of South Ossetia and Abkhazia will decide 
their own future, not America and Europe." 
 
(U)  Kokoity said he believed South Ossetia's chances of 
achieving independence were very high because of the Kosovo 
precedent, and the fact that they were not asking for 
immediate recognition by Russia of their independence; 
instead they would like to achieve international recognition 
"without any problems" from Russia or the West.  The two 
leaders stressed that their peoples were part of Europe with 
European culture just like Georgia and Russia, and their 
"contribution to stability in Europe could be very 
significant."  He said that the leaders had the support of 
their people based on past referenda. 
 
Negotiation Only With Russian Guarantees 
---------------------------------------- 
 
(U)  The leaders said that they had agreed to discuss all 
parts of the 6-point plan with Georgia's corrections, but 
only with Russian guarantees.  They insisted that they would 
refuse Georgian peacekeepers, and only Russian peacekeepers 
should operate in the two zones, but observers from the OSCE, 
the UN, and the Group of Friends could be discussed. 
However, they said that these observers could only be 
deployed in Georgian territory, not South Ossetia or 
Abkhazia.  Kokoity said that previously-agreed security zones 
should be reconsidered, saying that during the conflict, 
Russian troops deployed to places in Georgia from which the 
Georgian military had fired on South Ossetia and it was very 
important for the Russian troops to remain there in the 
future as a "buffer zone."  He lauded the efforts of the 
Russian peacekeepers and said that Russia intervened to 
protect all nations:  South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia 
and vice-versa.  He said that President Medvedev told him on 
August 14 that "we won because w 
e were right," and promised his support for any decision of 
South Ossetia or Abkhazia. 
 
West Morally Responsible for Georgian Attack 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
(U)  Both leaders blamed the West for its support of Georgia, 
and said that the United States and Europe had a moral 
responsibility for the death of South Ossetians.  They said 
that they had evidence that Western countries were involved 
in the planning of President Saakashvili's attack, because 
U.S. weapons were found along with detailed military maps. 
Furthermore, Kokoity said that the American journalist who 
came in with the Georgian side was further evidence of 
Western planning, saying that the American told him he was 
"there to report on the Georgian blitzkrieg."  When asked 
whether there were any foreign fighters among the Georgians, 
Kokoity responded that there were "mercenaries from Ukraine, 
Baltic countries, and blacks."  He said that Georgia did not

report all of their troop losses because they employed these 
mercenaries among their ranks. 
 
(U)  The leaders also noted that the West's war of 
information was suspiciously well prepared, with U.S. and 
U.K. news sources profiting heavily from their one-sided 
coverage.  Kokoity said that this coverage "should be 
considered as direct participation in the genocide."  They 
reiterated that Saakashvili should be prosecuted for war 
crimes, and lamented the double standard of the West in its 
reporting and support for only Georgian people and not those 
of South Ossetia.  They said that they could not trust the 
West.
