SUBJECT: BANK OF ALEXANDRIA SALE CONTRACT SIGNED 
 
 
¶1.  (U) The contract for sale of 80 percent of the shares of Bank of 
Alexandria (BOA) to the Italian bank Sanpaolo IMI was signed on 
October 31 by the Chairman of Sanpaolo, Enrico Salza, and Minister 
of Finance Youssef Boutros Ghali.  Sanpaolo deposited the $1.6 
billion cost of the purchase into an escrow account held by the 
Egyptian Ministry of Finance (MOF) on October 21.  The final sale 
will be executed on the stock exchange by the end of November.  The 
next step, however, is obtaining approval for the sale contract from 
the Central Banks of Egypt and Italy.  Central Bank of Egypt 
officials confirmed to econoff thQthe CBE Board of Directors will 
approve the contract at their regularly scheduled monthly meeting 
November 7.  Once the sale is final, BOA will be the largest private 
bank operating in Egypt. 
 
¶2.  (U) Speaking at the EgyptInvest 2006 conference today, Guiseppe 
Cuccerese, Head of International Affairs for Sanpaolo, said that 
Sanpaolo had no plans to change BOA's name or its management, 
including Chairman Mahmoud Abdel Latif.  BOA would remain an 
"Egyptian" bank, but with a new, international focus.  Retail 
banking, consumer credit and SME finance will remain BOA's primary 
activities, but emphasis will also be placed on investment banking, 
according to Cuccerese.  When queried about Sanpaolo's interest in 
the Egyptian banking sector, Cuccerese pointed to Egypt's renewed 
economic growth and its position at the center of the Middle 
East/North Africa region.  Sanpaolo already has a presence in 
Morocco and Tunisia, and plans to use BOA as a platform to further 
expand regionally. 
 
¶3.  (U) Comment:  An MOF official noted to econoff that the 
successful privatization of BOA will set the stage for further 
privatization in the banking sector.  The GOE has not announced 
plans to privatize another public bank, however, but the merger of 
Banque du Caire and Banque Misr is scheduled for completion by the 
end of the year.  Once the merger is complete, Egypt will have only 
two public banks, albeit with over 50 percent of the market share. 
In the absence of further privatization, the challenge for private 
banks will be to chip away at the dominate market share of the 
public banks.  End Comment.
