¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Chance 
2003 LLC, Kostroma, Russia. The company is listed on 
BIS license application D363828 as the ultimate 
consignee of 500 air pistols with red dot sight and 
flashlight. These items are controlled for missile 
technology reasons under ECCN EAR99. The licensee is 
Crossman Corporation, Routes 5 and 20, East 
Bloomfield, NY 14443. 
 
¶3. On October 3, 2006, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of Chance 
2003 LLC, 2, Elektrodnaya St., bld. 12-14, Moscow, 
Russia. The export control team met with Anatoly 
Shpatin, Commercial Director of Chance 2003, who is 
also the Director of the Moscow office. 
 
¶4. The company was originally founded in 1999 as a 
supplier of Crossman brand air rifles.  The company 
has been reorganized three times since inception, 
using the names Chance, Chance Plus, Chance 2003 and 
Chance Kostroma.  Over the last three years, Chance 
has expanded to distribution of other hunting, fishing 
and outdoors equipment.  The company also operates 8 
retail outlets in Kostroma and one in Moscow under the 
brand name "Ohotnik" (hunter). The company has two new 
offices, one in Kostroma and a representation office 
and warehouse in Moscow.  The company employs 150, 
with 15 in the Moscow office, 50 in the Kostroma 
headquarters, and the remainder in the retail stores. 
The company headquarters moved from its original 
location to the Kostroma Hotel, where they are renting 
the second floor of the hotel for temporary use as 
offices pending the completion of a two-story building 
with warehouse space in Kostroma. 
 
¶5. The company plans to sell the air pistols to 
consumers in Moscow and Kostroma.  Air pistols do not 
require licenses or permits from the Government of 
Russia, and therefore, the company is not required to 
keep detailed records of buyers.  The company does log 
sales, but without specific customer identification. 
Mr. Shpatin is aware of U.S. export controls, and does 
not intend on exporting goods outside of Russia.

(PSV) in reftel (b), Mr. Shpatin will review the 
records for the importation, which occurred in 2005. 
The records are kept at the company headquarters in 
Kostroma.  Mr. Shpatin agreed to provide copies 
indicating the disposition of the commodities. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post will recommend Chance 2003 
LLC of Kostroma and Moscow, Russia, as reliable 
recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities, upon 
receipt of documents requested in regards to Post- 
Shipment Verification originally reported in reftel 
(b).  It is requested that post be notified of final 
disposition of the application, and of any shipments 
for this organization in order to conduct appropriate 
FCS follow-up and statistical reporting.
