¶1. This is an action cable. See para 6. 
 
¶2. We used talking points and delivered the proposed outline for a 
global nuclear detection architecture model guidelines document 
November 21 to MFA Political Department Political Planning Division 
chief Oleh Klynchenko.  In doing so, we emphasized the need to 
provide a response and point-of-contact information for 
technical-level representatives by December 7. 
 
¶3. While we could not answer his question whether there would be 
limitations on the size of delegations to the January 22, 2008, 
meeting for Global Initiative partner nation technical experts, 
Klynchenko opined that the Ukrainian delegation might have 3-5 
members.  Klychenko also inquired about duration of the workshop. 
We advised him that, based on the information we had, it would be a 
one-day event. 
 
¶4. Klynchenko noted that counterterrorism was a cross-cutting issue 
shared by a number of different offices within the Ukrainian 
government, but the primary responsibility was centralized in the 
Anti-Terrorism Center, subordinate to the Security Service of 
Ukraine (SBU).  While the budget and programs for the next calendar 
year (note: also Ukraine's fiscal year) were still under 
consideration, the counterterrorism program had its own budget, with 
the funding for execution of the program allocated to existing 
organization like the State Border Guards Service, Customs, and the 
State Nuclear Regulatory Committee of Ukraine.  Klynchenko also 
inquired if there was any possibility for USG to fund travel of 
Ukrainian participants to the workshop. 
 
¶5. Klynchenko said our approach was timely, since MFA intended to 
hold a meeting during the week of November 26 of representatives 
from offices with counterterrorism responsibilities to form a 
working group to develop counterterrorism proposals.  The proposals 
to improve Ukraine's counterterrorism capability and enhance 
Ukrainian security would be provided not only to Ukrainian 
policymakers but also shared with Global Initiative Partners. 
 
¶6. We would appreciate receiving guidance by December 4 whether 
there is any possibility of USG funding participation of 3-5 
Ukrainian members at the workshop and if the duration of the 
workshop is only one day.  (Embassy POC is PolMilOff Mike Uyehara
