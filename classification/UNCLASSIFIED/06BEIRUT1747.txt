TV SHOW SATIRE 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  At 2300 hrs. local on June 1, Lebanese Shi'ite 
Muslims rioted in Rweissat Jdeideth, West Beirut, Baalbeck, 
Nabatieh, Sidon and Tyre in protest of a satirical TV show, 
entitled "Basmat-Watan," which mocked Hizballah Secretary 
General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.  The largest number of 
protesters were in West Beirut, where the short-notice 
demonstration  drew an estimated 15,000 participants. 
Demonstrators in West Beirut burned tires and blocked roads 
leading to Beirut's Hariri International Airport. 
Approximately 100 protesters in Rewessat Jdeideth, the area 
closest to the Embassy, and located 6 miles away, also set 
tires on fire.  No arrests were made, but one demonstrator 
was shot by one of Prime Minister Siniora's security officers 
when a crowd of demonstrators attempted to take the route 
leading to the Prime Minister's Office.  There were no other 
reported injuries. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The weekly 30-minute television show "Basmat-Watan" 
has a reputation for making fun of Lebanon's political 
leaders.  This was the first time that Hizballah's Nasrallah 
had been caricatured.  Nasrallah, during a telephone 
interview, thanked the protesters for their support but urged 
them to stop rioting and pledged to resolve the issue with 
the appropriate officials.  Shortly thereafter, at 0100 hrs. 
local on June 2, the rioters stopped protesting and headed 
home. 
 
¶3. (SBU) All Embassy personnel were immediately accounted 
for.  The Internal Security Forces (ISF) and Lebanese Armed 
Forces (LAF) increased security patrols around the Embassy as 
a precautionary measure.  At no time did the RSO receive 
information that the protesters were en route to or in the 
vicinity of the Embassy.  One scheduled off-compound move 
from the Embassy to the Beirut airport was canceled due to 
street closures surrounding the airport. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Currently no additional adjustments have been made 
to our already strict security measures.  The RSO will 
continue to monitor events and adjust security as necessary.
