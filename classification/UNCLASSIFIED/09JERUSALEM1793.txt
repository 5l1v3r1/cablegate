SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (10/09): Palestinians react to 
continued Israeli restrictions at Al Aqsa Mosque 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The dailies lead with reports on the strict Israeli security 
measures throughout the old city of Jerusalem for Friday prayers, as 
Palestinians were urged to mobilize in defense of Al-Aqsa Mosque. 
Islamic movements in the West Bank, Gaza and Israel have called on 
the Palestinians to consider today a "Day of Anger" and defend the 
mosque. In related news, the dailies report on Palestinian Authority 
(PA) Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Malki reporting to the press from New 
York that he asked UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to exert 
pressure on Israel to stop escalating the situation in the region. 
 
The local press reports on US Special Envoy George Mitchell's talks 
with Israeli officials yesterday in Jerusalem. The reports note that 
Mitchell met with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman and 
Israeli President Shimon Peres. Mitchell told Peres that the US will 
continue their efforts to ensure the resumption of negotiations 
between the Palestinians and Israelis, according to coverage. He 
also reiterated that President Obama and Secretary Clinton are 
determined to reach a comprehensive peace in the region. A US 
official noted that the recent incidents at Al-Aqsa Mosque and the 
implications of the Goldstone report prove once again the need for 
the two parties to resume negotiations and end the conflict. 
 
Al-Quds reports news citing AFP that Fatah is accusing the US of 
walking away from international agreements. Vice Secretary General 
of the Fatah Central Committee Jibril Al-Roujoub is quoted as saying 
"it is becoming obvious now that Obama's administration is deviating 
from the international agreements concerning the negotiations" and 
noted that there will be no resumption of negotiations unless Israel 
completely halts settlement activities and abides by their road map 
obligations. Al-Roujoub also said that "Palestine is not a US 
territory," according to coverage. 
 
The dailies report that Egypt has not received a request from Hamas 
to delay the national reconciliation agreement signing scheduled for 
October 25. The reports note that Egypt has urged all Palestinian 
factions to prioritize national interests and not get mired in the 
implications of postponing the vote on the Goldstone report.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Yousef Al-Qarei opined in Al-Quds independent daily under the 
title "Holy places in Jerusalem in danger" (10/09): "Given the 
European position on settlements over the past couple of years, we 
should push our mutual understanding with the EU at this critical 
time. In July 2008, the EU criticized the continuation of settlement 
activities following Israel's initial approval to build housing 
units on Abu Ghneim mountain in Jerusalem ... It is important that 
the EU Foreign and Security Policy Coordinator [Javier Solana] 
continues this work." 
 
2) Mohammad Yaghi opines in Al Ayyam independent daily under the 
headline "Defending the sin" (10/09):"Postponing the vote on the 
Goldstone report until next March will not pass without severe 
repercussions on Fatah, the PLO, and national reconciliation. The 
postponement created an earthquake among Palestinians and the Arab 
states that the decision makers in the PA did not expect. It will 
result in wide divisions for the PA. In reality, it's not possible 
to rescue the PA from itself if it can't realize its sin and stop 
constantly crossing red lines."
