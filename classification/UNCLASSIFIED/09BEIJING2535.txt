VISA POLICY IS A SOVEREIGN RIGHT 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  In regards to the denial of visas to the producers of a film 
regarding the earthquake in Sichuan, China stated the importance of 
an individual country's sovereign right to determine its own policy 
of visa issuance, said spokesperson Jiang Yu at the September 3 
regularly scheduled MFA press conference.  No comment would be made 
on any individual's visa application, and China will continue to 
provide visas for people who seek to enter for "normal activities," 
she added. 
 
JOINT MILITARY EXERCISE 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  In response to question as to why China has not yet answered an 
invitation by Australia and the United States to participate in a 
joint military exercise, Jiang referred the questioner to the 
Ministry of Defense. 
 
VISIT TO CHINA OF AMBASSADOR STEPHEN BOSWORTH 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Jiang said U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Policy 
Ambassador Stephen Bosworth is visiting China September 3-4 and will 
meet with Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and Vice Foreign Minister Wu 
Dawei.  The two sides will exchange views on the North Korean 
nuclear issue, Six Party Talks, and other issues. 
 
VISIT TO CHINA BY NORTH KOREAN VICE FOREIGN MINISTER KIM YONG-IL 
------------------------------- -------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Yong-Il is continuing his 
visit to China and is now in Jiangsu province.  His visit will 
continue through September 5-6 in Beijing, where he will exchange 
views with relevant PRC officials on bilateral relations and common 
interests. 
 
RIO TINTO 
--------- 
 
¶6.  In a question as to the status of the Rio Tinto case, Jiang 
stated the Chinese judicial authority works "according to law" and 
the Chinese - Australia consular agreement.  She stated that China 
hopes that the Australian side can join China to respect and 
accommodate each other's concerns. 
 
AMERICAN REPORTERS RELEASED FROM NORTH KOREA 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  Jiang refused to confirm whether the two American reporters 
recently released from North Korea were caught on Chinese soil or 
not.  When further pressed, she stated she had been very clear in 
her answers on previous occasions.  She said local authorities 
carried out the investigation. 
 
REBIYA KADEER 
------------- 
 
¶8.  China's position on Rebiya Kadeer is that she is a criminal and 
 
BEIJING 00002535  002 OF 002 
 
 
an ethnic separatist.  Jiang stated that foreign observers should 
"recognize her true nature," that she spreads lies and rumors to 
attack China, and her accusations are not "worthy of comment."  When 
asked for a response to former Australian Prime Minister John 
Howard's comment that "Chinese diplomacy is closing," she said that 
China promotes peace and stability and any individual who supports 
Kadeer is "disgraceful," and puts his or her own image at stake. 
 
INDONESIAN EARTHQUAKE 
--------------------- 
 
¶9. Recent reports show no Chinese casualties in today's Indonesian 
earthquake.  China expresses its condolences to the victims, Jiang 
said, and she further stated that the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia 
has launched an emergency response system to assist Indonesian 
authorities to help any victims. 
 
XINJIANG PROTESTS 
----------------- 
 
¶10.  Jiang noted no recent reports of violence but stated that the 
PRC is competent to handle any situation. 
 
CHINESE AND FRENCH RELATIONS 
---------------------------- 
 
¶11.  China and France are resuming development of respect and 
accommodation of each other, and Jiang expressed China's hope for 
celebrating in 2010 the two countries' 45th anniversary of bilateral 
relations.  She offered no information on future high-level 
exchanges between the two countries. 
 
G-20 
---- 
 
¶12.  Official Chinese attendance to the G-20 in Pittsburgh has not 
yet been determined.  Topics to be discussed are also still being 
determined, but Jiang said they are certain to include addressing 
the economic crisis and possible solutions.
