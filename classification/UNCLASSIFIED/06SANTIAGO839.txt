SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION-CHAVEZ' INTERNATIONAL INFLUENCE 
 
On April 20, conservative, influential newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (circ. 116,807) run an editorial entitled, "Mexico and 
Chavez."  Quote: 
 
"Hugo Chavez never thought his criticism last November of President 
Fox...for supporting FTAA talks would have an effect on Mexico's 
presidential campaign....  Thus far the Democratic Revolution Party 
(PRD) candidate Andres Manuel Lopez...leads the polls...with his 
defense of the poor, criticism of the government's decision to allow 
foreign capital to participate in the state energy sector and 
opposition to Mexico's integration in the global economy....  But 
Felipe Calderon, of the PAN, has begun labeling Lopez a 'Chavez 
replica'....  For Mexican voters any similarity to Chavez is a 
concern because Chavez' views do not attract foreign 
investment...and because of Mexico's ties to the United States, its 
most import commercial partner."
