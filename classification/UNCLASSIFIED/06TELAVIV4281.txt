Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Ha'aretz reported that on Saturday Khaled Meshal, the head of 
Hamas's political bureau, will meet senior Egyptian official in 
Cairo. The meeting is to discuss the fate of abducted Israeli 
soldier corporal Gilad Shalit, and is considered to be "critical." 
The paper noted that it is not yet sure that Meshal will indeed come 
to Cairo tomorrow. Maariv adds that Israel is conducting semi-direct 
talks with Hamas for Shalit's release.  The paper quotes foreign 
sources as reporting that the secret talks were conducted in Doha, 
Qatar, through Qatari mediation, between Ofer Dekel, who is in 
charge of the hostage portfolio in the Prime Minister's Office, and 
Hamas political bureau director Khaled Mashal. 
 
Maariv reported that in his meeting with US President George Bush, 
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will explain the harsh situation in Gaza 
to the president. He is also expected to clarify to the US president 
that an operation in Gaza is inevitable. Vice Premier Shimon Peres 
also met with Solana and told him that if Iran manages to 
manufacture nuclear weapons, these weapons will most probably be 
distributed to terror organizations such as Hizbullah. 
 
Leading media cited State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss as saying 
that there appears to be sufficient evidence to begin a criminal 
investigation of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on suspicion of 
involvement in the sale of Bank Leumi. According to the media 
Lindenstrauss has already transferred the material to Attorney 
General Menachem Mazuz, who will now have to decide whether to open 
an investigation against Olmert. 
 
The Jerusalem Post published an interview with MK Avigdor Lieberman 
in which he said that the Iranian threat must be dealt with 
discretely. He also said that Israel needs to wait and see what the 
EU, US, Russia and China do regarding Iran and that Israel must take 
a back seat on the issue. 
 
Maariv headlined a decision by Chief of Staff Dan Halutz to start 
bombing the Philadelphi route from the air using smart missiles in 
order to demolish tunnels used to smuggling weapons. 
 
Maariv reported that Chief of Staff Halutz sent a letter to PM 
Olmert warning that if the defense establishment does not get an 
addition of billions to its budget, the IDF will not be able to deal 
with its threats. 
Yediot cited Justice Minister Meir Shitrit intention to propose to 
PM Olmert to initiate a significant diplomatic process based on the 
Saudi proposal. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that Defense Minister Amir Peretz met with 
European Union foreign policy coordinator Javier Solana on Thursday. 
The paper cited Peretz as saying to Solana that Israel will continue 
flying over Lebanon until the abducted soldiers return and since 
UNSC resolution 1701 has been not implemented fully.  Peretz 
emphasized that the flights are a security need of Israel. 
 
All media reported that three Palestinians were killed in three 
separate incidents on Thursday in the Gaza Strip. One of them a 
civilian and two were reported as carrying weapons. Two Israelis 
were wounded in two separate incidents in the West Bank and Gaza. 
 
Yediot reported that the US has finalized a new proposal draft for 
sanctioning Iran following Russia's refusal to support the previous 
version. In the new draft, the sanctions (which are described as 
soft) will last only 30 days. After this time,  the IAEA will report 
on whether the Iranians have cooperated. 
 
Leading media reported that on Thursday the High Court of Justice 
rejected petitions of Palestinians from North Samaria against the 
construction of segments of the separation fence meant to protect 
three Jewish settlements,

Summary: 
-------- 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: "Peretz 
relinquished the last remnants of his influence over 
diplomatic-security affairs when he agreed to place the sensitive 
matter of strategic threats in the hands of the least appropriate 
person.  By agreeing to this appointment, he exhibited his absolute 
lack of understanding in matters of defense, strategy and 
deterrence." 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote in popular, pluralist 
Maariv: "The Americans, who do not intend to let Ahmadinejad put his 
hands on a nuclear bomb, are going to demand from us to demonstrate 
restraint and goods to sell to the Arab world in order to prepare 
the grounds." 
 
Columnist Nassim Abu Khait wrote in left-leaning, independent 
Arabic-language weekly Panorama: "The Labor Party's leadership 
should decide whether to end its historical cooperation with 
Israel's Arab citizens and get together with a person whose 
intentions are to destroy Palestinians cities and expel the 
[Israeli] Arabs out of the Triangle area.... These questions should 
be answered immediately and before the entry of Lieberman into the 
government."

¶I. "a Good Time to Quit" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (10/27): "If there 
is an appropriate time for the Labor Party to split over a matter of 
principle, the entry of Avigdor Lieberman and Yisrael Beiteinu into 
the government is the moment.... If there was a point to the 
existence of a Kadima-Labor government, in order to further the 
convergence plan, that has now evaporated.  With the inclusion of 
Lieberman, it is clear that any concessions in the West Bank have 
been forestalled. Negotiations with the Palestinians are also 
impossible, even if the Palestinians meet the most stringent 
preconditions, because a right-wing government has nothing to offer 
in such negotiations.   Today, it is clear that with the exception 
of a few houses that will be evacuated from this or that outpost in 
order to preserve Peretz's honor, this promise from the government's 
guidelines will also not be kept, making these guidelines indeed 
'worthless,' as Lieberman termed them.  Peretz will henceforth 
belong to a government that is right-wing on both diplomatic and 
socioeconomic issues, and it is doubtful that he will be able to 
represent those who elected him on any subject.  Peretz relinquished 
the last remnants of his influence over diplomatic-security affairs 
when he agreed to place the sensitive matter of strategic threats in 
the hands of the least appropriate person.  By agreeing to this 
appointment, he exhibited his absolute lack of understanding in 
matters of defense, strategy and deterrence." 
 
II. "Walking Towards Decision Time" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote in popular, pluralist 
Maariv (10/27): "Lieberman did not join the Olmert's government just 
for a minute.  They are going steady. In his discrete talks with 
Olmert, Yivett [Lieberman] promised Olmert up to two years of quiet. 
A liebermanic security belt, no shticks and no tricks.... They did 
not just agree on a year and a half or two of quiet, this is the 
crucial time frame that the whole region is walking towards.  In a 
year and a half from now George W. Bush will enter his last months 
of term in office.  That will be decision time against Iran. In the 
time that is left until that moment comes, Olmert and Lieberman will 
dedicate themselves for preparing Israel to these crucial days.  The 
Americans, which do not intend to let Ahmadinejad put his hands on a 
nuclear bomb, and are going to demand that we demonstrate restraint 
and goods to sell to the Arab world in order to prepare the grounds 
for action.... These days, US envoy General Dayton is working to 
update the real situation of Abu Mazen's forces ... When this 
examinations ends it will be decided between the US and Israel what 
the Palestinians really need in order to maintain their rule and 
defeat Hamas.  They will get what they need.  From the Americans, 
not from us." 
 
III. "Decide Now" 
 
Columnist Nassim Abu Khait wrote in left-leaning, independent 
Arabic-language weekly Panorama(10/27):"It seems that the time has 
arrived for the Labor Party to decide whether to continue its 
strategy of war and random killings of Palestinians on a daily 
basis.... or to take a 'hudna' and rethink that the Bush 
administration will not stay for long and its unlimited support of 
Israel's continuance occupation of Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese 
territories ... will also not stay for long.... The Labor Party's 
leadership should decide whether to end its historical cooperation 
with Israel's Arab citizens and get together with a person whose 
intentions are to destroy Palestinians cities and expel the 
[Israeli] Arabs out of the Triangle area.... These questions should 
be answered immediately and before the endorsement of Lieberman into 
the government."
