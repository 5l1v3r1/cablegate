SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) As part of his visit to Ashgabat to press forward in the 
bilateral relationship since the inauguration of President 
Berdimuhammedov, Deputy Assistant Secretary Evan Feigenbaum met on 
June 25 with Mejlis (Parliament) Speaker Akja Nurberdiyeva to 
discuss opportunities for cooperation between Turkmenistan's main 
legislative body and USG entities.  In a step forward from recent 
meetings with embassy representatives, the speaker outlined several 
upcoming parliamentary initiatives aimed at strengthening local 
self-governance and increasing the Mejlis' contact with local 
populations.  Although her description of planned activities closely 
resembled USAID's existing community empowerment program, she said 
the Mejlis planned to implement these programs in conjunction with 
the U.N. Development Program (UNDP).  After saying that most of her 
deputies had already visited the United States on various exchanges, 
she still stopped short of responding to DAS Feigenbaum's question 
about whether she might be willing to visit the U.S. to learn more 
about the relationship between the executive and legislative 
branches. End Summary. 
 
SMALL STEPS TOWARDS DECENTRALIZATION 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (U) SCA DAS Evan Feigenbaum met with Mejlis Speaker Akja 
Nurberdiyeva on June 25 to discuss recent developments and possible 
opportunities for cooperation.  Noting President Berdimuhammedov's 
stated desire to "make things real" during their meeting earlier the 
same morning (septel), DAS Feigenbaum highlighted the importance of 
maintaining a multidimensional nature to the U.S.-Turkmenistan 
relationship, including in the area of political development and 
democratization.  After a brief overview of the Mejlis' operations, 
Nurberdiyeva outlined a pilot local self-government program that was 
planned in conjunction with the UNDP.  Explaining that her 
understanding of self-government entails both greater local autonomy 
for local officials on issues such as financing and budgeting as 
well as increased citizens' participation, she stated that the 
current challenge for the Mejlis was to find elected officials who 
could carry out the planned activities.  Furthermore, if the 
previous relationship between hakimliks (Note: Appointed 
administrative local government structures.  End Note.) and the 
Gengeshe (Note: Locally elected, but largely powerless, government 
bodies.  End Note.) was like that of a supervisor and subordinate, 
she now hoped to change this into a "partnership." 
 
¶3.  (U) The Charge informed Nurberdiyeva that the planned activities 
closely resembled those already proposed by USAID's Community 
Empowerment Project, and expressed hope that Mejlis activities in 
this important area could be harmonized with USAID's efforts. 
(Comment: USAID submitted detailed information on this project to 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on April 5, but neither USAID nor 
its implementing partner, Counterpart International, has yet to 
receive any feedback from the government.  End Comment.) 
Nurberdiyeva noted that the first step in empowering local officials 
was to ensure that they understood the laws and their 
responsibilities.  To this end, beginning in mid-July, the Mejlis 
planned to train all Gengesh members, and suggested possible 
cooperation through assistance in publishing brochures on existing 
legislation. 
 
SLOWLY CHANGING MEJLIS INTERACTIONS WITH CITIZENS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4. (U) In response to DAS Feigenbaum's description of the many ways 
in which the legislative branch interacts with its constituents in 
the U.S., including direct elections, constituent services, district 
offices, and internships for constituents, Nurberdiyeva said that 
various connections currently existed between Turkmenistan's 
 
ASHGABAT 00000617  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
deputies and the public.  One example was that deputies traveled 
back to their districts to meet with their constituents.  Citizens 
were also able to connect with a Mejlis deputy, although not 
necessarily the representative from their district, if they came to 
the parliament building.  While lacking office space for each 
member, common meeting rooms were available for use during such 
encounters.  Additionally, Mejlis members held a call-in television 
show that addressed various aspects of legislation and civic issues. 
 
 
¶5. (U) Quoting the maxim that "all politics are local," DAS 
Feigenbaum noted many new possibilities to link citizens to their 
local officials.  Nurberdiyeva stated that Turkmenistan was "just in 
the early stages" and was trying to resolve this challenge by 
linking local officials to the Mejlis deputies.  Reflecting her past 
work with, and interest in, education and youth issues, the speaker 
stressed the importance of an educated and informed population in 
this process, especially its role in nominating and selecting 
candidates for local office. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Summarizing three areas of common interest, DAS Feigenbaum 
noted that the discussion had touched on local self-government, 
connecting citizens to the Mejlis, and elections.  He suggested that 
opportunities for cooperation existed with ongoing USAID programs 
focused on local self-governance.  In order to see how the U.S. 
Congress provided constituent services in both Washington, DC, and 
its local offices, he asked when the speaker and other delegates 
might be interested in visiting the United States.  Nurberdiyeva 
responded that "We have many people who can go."  Regarding 
elections, DAS Feigenbaum recalled his January meeting with Foreign 
Minister Meredov when they had discussed the prospect of OSCE 
support for a sequence of elections, including upcoming Mejlis 
elections.  He encouraged the speaker to take advantage of the 
OSCE's expertise in this area.  Finally, he suggested that 
internship programs were a good way to get youth involved in their 
government. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7. (U) The always engaging Speaker Nurberdiyeva was more expansive 
in her plans for the Mejlis than she has been in recent meetings 
with embassy visitors.  She acknowledged the importance of education 
in developing an informed citizenry as well as to a local government 
that is able to respond to its citizens' needs.  Significant 
opportunities exist to work with the Mejlis, an emerging entity in 
post-Niyazov Turkmenistan, and recent working-level meetings with 
selected Mejlis committee heads have demonstrated an interest on 
their part to learn more about the types of technical assistance the 
USG can offer.  In order to move to the next step, embassy should 
submit concrete proposals for their review.  End Comment. 
 
¶8. DAS Feigenbaum has cleared this message.
