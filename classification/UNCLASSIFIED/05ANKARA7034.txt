¶1.  (U) Summary.  There have been no new outbreaks of Avian 
Influenza (AI) in Turkey since the October outbreak. 
According to reports, the Government of Turkey (GOT) has 
been testing for AI in the case of any suspicious bird 
deaths.  Poultry consumption has steadily risen but is still 
well below pre-outbreak levels.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
No New AI Cases, Testing Continues 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Although there have been no new reported cases of AI 
since the October outbreak the GOT continues to test for any 
signs of the virus in the region.  The strict quarantine has 
been lifted although the GOT will maintain surveillance in 
the region for some time. 
 
---------------------------- 
Reports of Other Bird Deaths 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The GOT seems to be maintaining good surveillance of 
any suspicious bird deaths.  Reports indicated bird deaths 
in Inegol near Bursa, Cankiri near Ankara and Fununlu near 
Izmir.  AI was not detected in any of these cases.  However, 
in Inegol, Newcastle disease was confirmed and over 900 
birds were destroyed.  Newcastle is suspected in Furunlu but 
tests are ongoing.  Neither AI nor Newcastle has been 
detected in Cankiri.  Note.  We take it as a very positive 
sign that farmers and the GOT continue to monitor and report 
on any suspicious deaths.  End note. 
 
--------------------- 
New Compensation Fund 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Compensation of farmers for any culling of birds 
remains a incentive for continued reporting especially on 
smaller farms. A new association has been formed called 
"Healthy Chicken Information Platform." It consists of 18 
chicken producers.  This group developed the compensation 
fund of 100,000 YTL for the farmers who were affected by the 
October AI outbreak. Industry sources report that current 
Turkish laws prohibit the GOT from paying compensation to 
farmers.   However, the GOT may seek to change this law in 
the upcoming budget. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
EU Lifts Ban on Turkish Poultry Products 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) EU has lifted the ban for imports of poultry feathers 
from Turkey.  However, poultry meat exports are not approved 
although the ban is not connected to AI.  Turkey has been 
seeking permission to export poultry meat to the European 
Union for a number of years but has been denied access due 
to Turkey's restrictions on EU beef imports. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Demand Recovering from Still Down 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Broiler meat demand has improved since the outbreak 
but is still only 50 percent of demand.  Because of the 
production cycle, poultry companies were not been able to 
reduce production immediately.  Most companies stored meat 
in freezers rather than selling at a loss, but storage 
facilities are currently full.  Egg demand is now 60 percent 
of normal.
