1.(U) As per reftel, Econoff conducted an extensive review 
into the membership and affiliates of the UN's World Tourism 
Organization (UNWTO) to ensure that none of the WTO's 
associates or members condone pedophilia.  Based on the 
review, Post determined that the UNWTO does not grant any 
official status, accreditation, or recognition to any 
organization which promotes and condones or seeks the 
legalization of pedophilia or has subsidiaries or member 
organizations that do.  The UNWTO is based in Madrid, Spain. 
 
¶2. (U) In conducting its review, Post examined the roughly 
300 affiliate members of the UNWTO comprised of business 
groups, destination councils, and educational institutions. 
Post has a copy of this list and will send it on to IO/RHS 
per reftel.  Alternatively, the list can be accessed at 
www.untwo.org/afiliados/directory/en/director y/php. 
 
¶3. (U) The UNWTO has an extensive program under its Task 
Force to Protect Children from Sexual Exploitation in Tourism 
which was established in 1997.  The task force had its 
twenty-fourth meeting in Berlin on March 13, 2009 and 
discussed UNWTO's Protect the Children Campaign launched last 
year with a publicity spot that directs viewers to: 
www.unto.org/protectchildren. 
 
¶4. (U) Total staff time dedicated to this project was 
approximately 2-3 hours. 
 
¶5. (U) The embassy contact for this issue is Econoff Amy
