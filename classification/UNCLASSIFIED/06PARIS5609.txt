     ¶B. PARIS 5157 
 
This supplements our interim report (ref B) on GOF UNGA 
attendance. 
 
¶A.  Attendance of the Head of State: 
 
--  Jacques Chirac, President of the French Republic. 
 
--  Arrival and departure dates are uncertain, but MFA on 
August 21 reports he will probably leave after the second day 
of the UNGA.  He plans to give France's address. 
 
--  Presence of spouse (Bernadette):  Undetermined, but 
likely. 
 
--  President Chirac's English is good, but he usually 
prefers the presence of an interpreter in formal meetings. 
 
¶B.  Attendance of the Head of Government:  MFA reports no 
present plan for PM Dominique de Villepin to attend. 
 
¶C.  Attendance of the Foreign Minister: 
 
--  Philippe Douste-Blazy, Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
 
--  MFA reports that FM Douste-Blazy will attend the UNGA and 
will head France's delegation once President Chirac leaves. 
 
--  Arrival and departure dates are uncertain, according to 
the MFA. 
 
--  Presence of spouse:  Undetermined (but unlikely, in our 
view, based on recent practice). 
 
--  FM Douste-Blazy speaks some English but requires an 
interpreter at formal meetings.
