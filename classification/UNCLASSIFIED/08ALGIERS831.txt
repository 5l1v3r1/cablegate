We delivered reftel demarche on July 27 to officials who 
cover Iran at the MFA's disarmament office.  They told us 
that the information contained in reftel would be reviewed by 
the Algerian interagency body responsible for implementing 
U.N. Security Council resolutions.  We will also deliver the 
list of Iranian entities contained in reftel to the Algerian 
financial intelligence unit, the CTRF.
