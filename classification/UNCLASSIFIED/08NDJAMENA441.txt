------------------ ------------------ 
EUROPEAN PEACEKEEPING FORCE TO LEAVE CHAD 
----------------- -------------------- 
 
¶1. THERE WAS MUCH PRESS DISCUSSSION DURING THE WEEK REGARDING 
REPLACEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN PEACEKEEPING FORCE BY AN EXPANDED UNITED 
NATIONS PRESENCE. DESPITE GIVING SPACE TO OXFAM CRITICISMS SAYING 
THAT NO IMPROVEMENT OF THE SECURITY SITUATION HAS BEEN OBSERVED ON 
THE GROUND AS WELL AS OXFAM'S ALLEGATION THAT NGOS CONTINUE TO BE 
THREATENED, THE MEDIA WAS GENERALLY POSITIVE ABOUT EUFOR'S 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE PROPSED FOLLOW-ON ARRANGEMENTS. 
 
---------------- ------------------------- 
THE CASE OF HISSEIN HABRE IN SENEGAL 
------------------ ----------------------- 
 
¶2. FOURTEEN (14) VICTIMS OF FORMER CHADIAN PRESIDENT HISSEIN HABRE 
(12 CHADIANS AND 2 SENEGALESE) FILED A NEW COMPLAINT AGAINST HIM IN 
DAKAR. LAWYER JACQUELINE MOUDEINA SAID THAT THE COMPLAINT ARISES 
FROM THE TORTURE OF PRISONERS PERPETRATED BY HABRE'S INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICE (OFFICE OF DOCUMENTATION AND SECURITY - DDS).  VICTIMS 
BELIEVE THAT THE PROSPECTS FOR A VALID TRIAL IN 2008 ARE MUCH BETTER 
THAN THE DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN 2000 WHEN THEY FIRST SOUGHT 
REDRESS. 
 
------------------- ---------------------- 
INSECURITY 
------------------- --------------------- 
 
¶3. POLICE HAVE RESUMED FOOT PATROLS IN N'DJAMENA IN AREAS WHERE 
THERE IS LIMITED VEHICLE ACCESS. AS A RESULT OF THE PATROLS NEW 
DIRECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE, GENERAL MAHAMT ACHAKIR YOUSSOUF, TOLD 
THE PRESS THAT CROOKS WERE ARRESTED. INVESTIGATIONS INTO THEIR 
ACTIVITIES CONTINUE. ADDITIONALLY, CHAD AND CAMEROON HAVE JOINED 
EFFORTS TO INTERDICT MOVEMENT OF BANDITS AND RUSTLERS ACROSS THEIR 
COMMON BORDER. ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR OF CHAD'S WEST MAYO KEBBI 
PROVINCE, MR. HISSEIN AHMAT DJIMET, THE SITUATION IS NOW UNDER 
CONTROL. 
------------------- ---------------------- 
PREPARATION OF THE GENERAL BUDGET FOR CHAD IN 2009 
------------------- ---------------------- 
 
¶4. NEW MINISTER OF FINANCE, GATA NGOULOU, SAID THE GOVERNMENT PLANS 
TO REDUCE EXPENDITURES IN 2009. HE SAID MILITARY COSTS ARE TOO HIGH 
AND THE INSTITUTION OF BETTER CONTROLS CAN SAVE MONEY. MINISTERIAL 
MEETINGS TO FRAME THE BUDGET FOR 2009 ARE UNDERWAY. 
 
-------------------- -------------------- 
EDUCATION 
-------------------- --------------------- 
¶5. STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF N'DJAMENA PROMISE TO STRIKE IF 
THEIR SCHOLARSHIPS ARE NOT PAID BEFORE SEPTEMBER 25, 2008.  THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS NOT PAID STIPENDS FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS. 
 
------------------ ----------------------- 
BAD MILK 
------------------ ----------------------- 
¶6. THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE DEFENSE OF CONSUMER RIGHTS, ADC, WARNED 
THE POPULATION AGAINST THE USE OF CHINESE MILK. REPORTEDLY CHAD IS 
ONE OF THE COUNTRIES THAT MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED TAINTED MILK. ALTHOUGH 
NO POISONINGS HAVE BEEN REPORTED, CONSUMERS WERE ASKED TO BE 
VIGILANT. 
 
------------------- --------------------- 
ECONOMY 
------------------- ---------------------- 
 
¶7. THE BANK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CENTRAL AFRICAN COUNTRIES, BDEAC, 
ORGANIZED AN "OPEN HOUSE" ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2008 IN N'DJAMENA TO 
EXPLAIN TO CHADIAN BUSINESSMEN THE PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING PROJECT 
LOANS. IN ADDITION TO FUNDING PROJECTS, THE INSTITUTION PROVIDES 
SUPPORT FOR INITIAL FEASIBLITY STUDIES. FOR THE PERIOD OF 2008 - 
2012, 220 BILLION CFA ARE AVAILABLE TO FUND PROJECTS IN THE CEMAC 
ZONE. 
 
-------------------- --------------------- 
MEDIA 
-------------------- -------------------- 
¶8. THE ASSOCIATION OF PRIVATE PRESS EDITORS MET TO DISCUSS HIGHER 
PRODUCTION COSTS LINKED TO A JUMP IN PRINTING CHARGES LEVIED BY 
PRINTERS. EDITORS PREVIOUSLY COMPLANTED TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF 
 
NDJAMENA 00000441  002 OF 002 
 
 
THIS AND OTHER PROBLEMS, EXPLAINING THAT CENSORSHIP BROUGHT ON BY 
THE SECURITY CRISIS IN N'DJAMENA LAST FEBRUARY 2008 COUPLED WITH 
COST AUGMENTATIONS RISKS THE LOSS OF INDEPENDENT MEDIA IN CHAD.
