SUBJECT: Iraq, Global Economic Crisis- Sao Paulo Media Reaction 
 
Title- Agreement in Baghdad 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (11/19) says: 
Dpproved by the near unanimous consent of the Iraqi parliament, the 
security agreement between Iraq and the United States, foresees the 
total withdrawal of 150 thousand soldiers of the occupation troops 
by the end 2011...this is a step forward, although in swampy soil, 
in search of a way out for what was considered to be the United 
States' most disastrous recent foreign political decision - the 
invasion of dictator Saddam Hussein's territory in March 2003. ... 
The agreement is also interesting for the Bush administration, as it 
is a way to show to history, that not everything in the Iraq 
adventure was the failure foreseen by his critics." 
 
Title- Recession, Depression or Depressed? 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (11/19) by economist Paulo 
Rabello de Castro comments: "...The lesson learned from this global 
crisis is clear: by fighting against [economic] adjustments always 
postponed, the present political leaders, anxious and confused, 
order more recession with inflation tomorrow.  Maybe even a 
depression is on the way, if the confidence in the monetary regimes 
has finally dried up.  The huge Wall Street bubble crisis diminished 
the importance of the men that are facing it.  The generalization 
and the lack of focus of the G-20 proposals last week showed the 
stage of perplexity, not only of the economists, but also of the 
authorities that are committed to discover the "genetics" of this 
disease.  Just like moving sand, the more we discuss, the faster we 
sink."
