REF: STATE 105588 
 
¶1.  Reftel raised important issues concerning coordination 
between post Public Affairs Section (PAS) and 
Management/ICASS sections in support of public diplomacy 
programs and activities.  PAS Turkey does receive adequate 
ICASS support -- when questions or issues arise, they are 
worked out in a collegial manner through direct 
communications between PAS and the relevant MGT section. 
Problems that periodically arise due to general resource 
limitations (budget, personnel, vehicles) affect all 
sections, including PAS.  Given inevitable staff turnover on 
both sides, it might be useful to update and reissue the 
"matrix" of who pays for what as an annual cable (perhaps 
each September), along with clear instructions as to how PAS 
personnel are to be treated/charged for equipment (eg., cell 
phones) that is provided to all State employees. 
 
¶2.  The major challenge in PD administration at our post 
comes from the lack of a PAS executive officer or senior LES 
to handle the various administrative support duties and 
coordinate with GSM, FMO, IRM, and HR.  As a result, the PAOs 
in Ankara and Istanbul need to spend more time directly 
working with MGT/ICASS colleagues on various financial, 
personnel and administrative questions.  Some of these do 
require the direct attention of the PAO, but many of them 
could be properly handled by a well-trained LES or EFM 
colleague.  We therefore support any efforts Washington might 
pursue to develop (and fund) such positions. 
 
¶3.  Grants continue to be a critically important tool for us. 
 The vast majority of our grants are for public diplomacy 
programs and activities, but we are currently working with 
non-PD colleagues on a grant to fund a Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation (BSEC) seminar with a mixture of post PD funds 
and non-PD funding from EUR.  We are fortunate to have an 
experienced LES employee in PAS Turkey for handling grants, 
since the Public Affairs Section is expected to provide the 
expertise and proper procedures for grant implementation and 
reporting.
