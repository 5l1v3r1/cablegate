¶1. ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 
 
a. "The U.S.' selfish bill makes the world feel cold" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/18): "Along with the approval of the U.S.' 
economic stimulus plan, 787$ billion, the disputable 'buy American' 
bill has become an American law. To avoid the public's anger, 
Congress added a restrictive item that states that the trade 
promises of America must be followed. However, only Europe, Canada, 
and other developed countries are included in this statement.  Newly 
emerging countries like China, India, Russia and Brazil are 
excluded. The U.S. in categorizing the different countries in this 
way intended to split global anger towards the U.S. The U.S.; 
policies has been criticized as being a selfish mechanism to cool 
the globe. Chinese experts indicate that the U.S. economic stimulus 
plan includes many infrastructure construction projects. Even 
without the 'buy American' bill, the U.S. originally regulated that 
public construction projects must use home-made iron and steel for 
their component parts. In fact, trade protectionism is an old habit 
of the U.S. Trade protectionism is embodied in different formats, 
completely obvious, partially disguised and completely hidden. The 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Geithner's criticism about the alleged 
currency manipulation of China's sounds like he is calling for 
freedom of information, but in fact he is forcing the RMB to 
appreciate and protect his own exports. This is also a form of trade 
protectionism." 
 
b. "The world debates as to whether 800$b can save the U.S." 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/18): "These days, there are many lobbyists 
in Washington; they are coming to be a part of the stimulus plan. 
Different lobbyist are lining up in a long queue to get their piece 
of the pie. Many American and global media organizations have 
reminded the U.S. that the primary affects of the plan will not be 
seen until 2010. Can the Americans wait that long?  Various 
suspicions about the effect of the stimulus plan have been spreading 
in different fields. Among these voices, the concern that the plan 
will cause a large fiscal deficit is the most prominent. American 
economists compared Obama to Roosevelt, but with a higher reform 
goal. A Swedish expert believes that China's 4,000,000,000,000 y. (4 
trillion y.) stimulus plan will be more effective than the U.S. 
800$b." 
 
¶2. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"The U.S. and China look for the rules in a 'big-country's' game" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/18): "The development of U.S.-China 
relations is going through three steps: first, establishing broad 
connections and interests; second, establishing a system to 
coordinate the bilateral interests; and third, establishing the 
rules of the game involved in getting the two countries to interact 
with each other. When the bilateral relationship matures, the main 
task will be to establish unprecedented rules in the game. Regarding 
the broadness and depth of the development of the bilateral 
relations, the new rules should cover broad areas. New rules should 
not be limited to the bilateral field, but should concentrate more 
on global issues. The process of establishing rules will be a 
complicated process full of conflicts. The new rules will be a model 
around the world. They will symbolize the trend of development and 
influence international relations in the 21st century. The two 
countries' elites should realize when they are making new rules in 
this game, that they are making a behavioral model for the 
international society, not just for the bilateral relations."
