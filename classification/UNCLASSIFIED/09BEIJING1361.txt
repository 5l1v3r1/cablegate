  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. ISRAEL 
 
"Obama urges Israel to accept this historic opportunity for peace" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao) (05/20): "It was said that Obama's main goal for this meeting 
was to send a message to Netanyahu demanding that Israel not 
surprise the U.S. with an Israeli led military operation against 
Iran.  However, Netanyahu hopes to see an American dialogue with 
Tehran conducted shortly.  It seems that both Obama and Netanyahu 
have fulfilled 50% of their goals.  Although they both want to 
maintain their special alliance, the Obama administration's Middle 
East strategy, based on their smart power concept, is hardly 
acceptable to a right-wing Israeli government.  If the security 
situation between Israel and Palestine worsens, or the Iran issue 
becomes stagnant, then the conflict between the U.S. and Israel will 
become more acute." 
 
¶2. A/H1N1 
 
"American approach to isolation and quarantine" 
 
Global Times English (English-language daily published by the 
People's Daily) (05/20): "China has taken aggressive measures to 
contain the outbreak of the A/H1N1 influenza, acting more quickly 
and resolutely.  By contrast, the U.S. has been very cautious about 
employing non-pharmaceutical interventions, despite the fact it has 
had more confirmed cases of A/H1N1 than any other country.  Respect 
for individual liberties and dignity permeates all the major aspects 
of American pandemic prevention. The U.S. view of isolation and 
quarantine is deeply influenced by its culture, as well as its 
socio-economic system and medical systems.  While some Americans 
complain that China has been too eager to use quarantines to fight 
outbreaks, many Chinese also criticize the U.S. for its 
ineffectiveness in containing pandemics.  But really, the two 
countries have totally different characteristics and should 
understand more about each other." 
 
¶3. RUSSIA 
 
"Russia-U.S. relations at a turning point" 
 
Global Times English (English-language daily published by the 
People's Daily) (05/20): "The Obama administration's interest is in 
following the Democratic Party's diplomatic philosophy of 
cooperation between great powers.  The U.S. has suffered a number of 
diplomatic setbacks lately that make repairing relations with Russia 
imperative. The weak global economy also means that the two sides 
must seek compromises and mutually beneficial solutions to overcome 
the crisis. This would not have happened during the Bush 
administration.  The agreement will help both sides slow a new arms 
race, something Russia especially wants.  In the near future, 
Russian-U.S .relations are bound to improve greatly, especially 
after Medvedev and Obama meet in July.  Improving relations between 
Russia and the U.S. will take pressure off China's relationship with 
both countries.  A strained Russia-U.S. relationship would likely 
lead to increased ties between Moscow and Beijing, potentially 
making China's relationship with the U.S. frostier.  Therefore, it's 
in China's interest to see the two powers improve their 
relationship."
