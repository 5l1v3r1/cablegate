SUBJECT: CHINA'S WOMAN OF COURAGE: EDITOR HU SHULI 
 
REF: STATE 12871 
 
¶1.  Embassy Beijing is pleased to nominate Hu Shuli, 
editor in chief of Caijing magazine, to receive the 
Secretary's inaugural International Women of Courage 
 
SIPDIS 
Award (ref).  Hu has not just broken through the glass 
ceiling many professional women in China face -- she 
has shattered it.  In doing so, she has become one of 
the most influential figures in Chinese publishing and 
serves as an inspiration to women and to journalists 
of both genders who are striving for a more equitable 
social, political and economic landscape in China.

Justification:  Hu Shuli's goal is to bring 
objectivity and professionalism to China's print 
media.  This is no easy task.  The state continues to 
control the press in China and the Central Propaganda 
Department reprimands news outlets that publish 
content the censors deem inappropriate.  Punishments 
can range from criticism to fines to editors losing 
their jobs. 
 
As editor in chief of the biweekly Caijing Magazine, 
which aspires to be China's version of The Economist, 
Hu encourages her reporters to constantly push the 
editorial envelope.  In building her newsroom team, Hu 
has taken pains to bring aboard young journalists, 
women and men, who have little experience in 
traditional state media and who want to report stories 
straight, without an ideological tint.  She often 
identifies the most promising among them and arranges 
graduate training in journalism in the United States. 
As a result, Caijing regularly runs groundbreaking 
exposes that reveal corruption and other misconduct in 
Chinese officialdom and among the business elite.  At 
the same time, the magazine often risks unwelcome 
attention from the censors by venturing beyond 
business and into sensitive subjects related to 
health, the environment, law and politics.  Caijing's 
opinion pages also feature guest columnists whose 
pieces question government policy, particularly in the 
areas of business and finance. 
 
All this adds up to make Caijing an invaluable read 
for decision-makers or anyone who wants a largely 
unvarnished view of what is going on in Chinese 
economics.  Moreover, Hu is proof positive for Chinese 
women entering the workforce that when it comes to 
making a difference in the public square, gender bias 
can not only be overcome.  It can be conquered, even 
in a field like journalism, which in China has been 
traditionally dominated by men.
