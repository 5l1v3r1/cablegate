His Excellency President Barack Obama 
President of the United States 
Department of State (NSC) 
Washington, DC 
USA 
 
Dear President Obama, 
 
On behalf of the people of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and myself, 
I would like to congratulate you on the 213th anniversary of the 
American Independence.  We Kurds like to think we share with 
Americans the ideals enshrined in the Declaration of Independence: 
"...that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their 
creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness." 
 
Many Americans have given their lives so that we Kurds and Iraqis 
might enjoy unalienable rights.  Policies often change over time but 
we Kurds are loyal to our friends and we will never forget the 
American efforts in Iraqi Kurdistan. 
 
We wish you and all Americans a very happy and safe Fourth of July 
Holiday weekend. 
 
Yours very sincerely, 
Signed 
Masoud Barzani 
President of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.
