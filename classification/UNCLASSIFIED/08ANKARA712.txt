Rice Addresses ATC Meetings in Washington 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Taraf, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, and 
Yeni Safak report Secretary Rice addressed the American-Turkish 
Council's (ATC) 27th annual conference in Washington on Tuesday. 
Secretary Rice said Washington is closely following the AKP closure 
 
SIPDIS 
case.  Mainstream Hurriyet notes in, "A Secularist Blow from Rice," 
that, "Rice emphasized that Turkey must solve the AKP closure case 
within a secularist context and secularist principles."  Meanwhile, 
Islamist-oriented Zaman writes, "We are watching the closure case 
closely, but an ear must be given to the voices of the voters."  NTV 
notes Rice characterized the closure case as "an issue for the Turks 
to solve."  Conservative-nationalist Ortadogu notes Rice emphasized, 
"The U.S. and Turkey share important democratic values," but that, 
"The Turks must make the decision concerning the closure case." 
Mainstream Milliyet calls Rice's emphasis on secularism, "striking," 
but points out, "the U.S. is determined to remain impartial and did 
not extend its support to the AKP." 
 
On Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code, Rice said the U.S. 
"encouraged" changes to the article, and congratulated Prime 
Minister Erdogan for his efforts to change the law.  Rice stressed 
it was important that "Turkey transforms its democracy and joins the 
EU."  She also urged Turkey to improve non-Muslim minority rights 
and grant freedoms to the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul. 
Regarding the PKK, Rice said the aim was to eliminate the PKK in 
northern Iraq and cut the organization's financial resources in 
cooperation with European partners. 
 
Bryza, Lagendijk at ATC Meetings 
Hurriyet, Sabah, Vatan, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others report 
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian 
affairs Matt Bryza told the American-Turkish Council (ATC) meetings 
in Washington the continuation of Turkey's EU process falls within 
the strategic interests of the U.S.  "Some reform opportunities 
might have been missed, but in the end, it is the Turkish people who 
decide on the types of reforms to be realized," Bryza said. 
Islamist-leaning English language Today's Zaman says, "Bryza 
recommended that Turkey should take steps 'for strengthening 
cultural rights' for Kurdish people after the finalization of 
military steps against the PKK." 
 
Mainstream Hurriyet quotes on page one Joost Lagendijk, co-chairman 
of Turkey-EU joint parliamentary commission, as saying "The AKP must 
show that it wants to carry Turkey to the EU, not to Iran." 
Lagendijk stressed the EU was "disappointed" that EU adjustment 
reforms slowed down in Turkey following the adoption of a number of 
reforms in 2003-2004.  "Turkey should carry out reforms to improve 
the living standards of Turkish people, not merely to please the 
EU," he emphasized.  Lagendijk criticized the AKP for failing to 
take forward steps concerning the Kurdish question.  He also said, 
"The AKP misjudged its timing and approach to the headscarf debate. 
The AKP's headscarf reforms should have been passed as part of a 
broader reform package."  Nevertheless, Lagendijk also warned "the 
closure of the AKP could lead to a suspension of Turkey's EU 
membership talks." 
 
AKP Alone in Changing Article 301 
All papers continue coverage of the ruling AKP government's proposed 
changes to Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code, which outlaws 
"insulting Turkishness."  Speaking to reporters on his return from 
Qatar, Prime Minister Erdogan said the parliamentary committee was 
still working on the changes.  Erdogan dismissed approaches such as 
"the changes are imposed by the EU" and said the amendments were 
brought onto agenda on a "serious demand from the country." 
Opposition far right MHP chairman Devlet Bahceli told his party 
group yesterday that by changing Article 301, PM Erdogan actually 
intended to "fund his political future" by securing the support of 
the EU.  "Our party will not take part in such an assassination 
 
ANKARA 00000712  002 OF 003 
 
 
attempt against the Turkish nation," stressed Bahceli.  Under the 
headline, "The AKP is Left Alone in Changing 301," liberal Radikal 
reports the pro-Kurdish DTP group Chief Ahmet Turk said his party 
will not back the AKP proposal for amending the article.  Turk said 
"Article 301 killed Armenian journalist Hrant Dink," and called for 
the "total abolishment" of the article. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Amendment of Penal Code Article 301 
 
"The Limit of the AKP's Love for Democracy" 
Mehmet Y. Yilmaz wrote in mainstream Hurriyet (4/16): "In January 
2008 newspaper archives, one can easily find statements from Prime 
Minister Erdogan and Justice Minister Sahin which promised changes 
to Article 301.  That was in January, and now we are in April and 
the debates concerning Article 301 continue.  While the prime 
minister insists on the presidency as the decision-making authority 
in 301 cases, some in the AKP suggest one of three choices, i.e. the 
justice minister, the president or an independent board.  This rift 
within the party is a demonstration of the AKP's effort to keep up 
appearances.  After three months, the ruling party is still 
indecisive on how to change one law.  The AKP does not care about 
democracy or freedom of thought.  The AKP follows its hidden agenda 
and pretends to play a democracy game when it is necessary to 
protect their power.  EU officials are either pretending to take 
this bait or else, they truly have taken the bait." 
 
"The 301 War" 
Mustafa Unal wrote in Islamist leaning Zaman (4/16): "The 
controversial Article 301 is now in parliament and is expected to 
come to the floor next week.  The impact of foreign suggestions to 
revise 301 is undeniable and inevitable.  Turkey could have changed 
the law itself before other countries had a chance to chime in with 
their criticisms; but unfortunately that did not happen.  301 should 
be changed because it keeps Turkey behind global standards regarding 
democracy and freedom of thought.  The wording of 301 should be 
clear and precise.  Currently the debate continues to determine who 
has the authority to approve a court case based on 301.  Some in the 
AKP think that providing the president with that kind of authority 
would be wrong.  The opposition, on the other hand, seems like a 
bloc completely united against 301.  We have to keep in mind that 
the state needs protection but individuals need protection as well. 
Politics is obliged to respect state and individual law at the same 
time." 
 
Barzani Wants Kurds to 'Stay Away from Violence' 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak writes Zagros TV reported the Kurdish 
Regional Administration (KRA) leader Massoud Barzani met with a 
delegation of the Sirnak Bar Association in Selahaddin in northern 
Iraq.  Barzani said, "Kurds must change the way they think; using 
violence is a thing of the past."  He added, "We need to make 
fundamental changes.  We have introduced democracy for Iraq and 
federalism for Kurdistan; now we need to take our nationalism to a 
different phase."  Barzani went on saying, "Now is the time for 
dialogue.  Kurds should not get involved in violence either at home 
or in neighboring countries." 
 
DTP Mayors Fined for Supporting Roj TV 
All papers report 53 pro-Kurdish DTP mayors were sentenced to 2 1/2 
months in prison for supporting the pro-PKK Roj TV.  The sentences 
were commuted to fines of 1,875 YTL each.  The mayors were convicted 
of supporting crime and criminals because they asked Danish Prime 
Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen in a letter not to take the 
Copenhagen-based Roj TV off the air in Denmark.
