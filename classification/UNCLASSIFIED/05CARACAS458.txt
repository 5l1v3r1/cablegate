SUBJECT: DISASTER DECLARATION DUE TO FLOODING IN NORTHERN 
VENEZUELA 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: Heavy rains have been falling throughout much of 
northern Venezuela for nearly three full days.  Serious 
flooding has occurred in many parts of the country, primarily 
coastal areas, but also parts of the capital, Caracas.  At 
least thirteen (13) people are reported dead, and upwards of 
3,000 are reportedly homeless, and several roads, including 
the main artery for cargo transportation, are closed due to 
landslides.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. Approximately 10.5 inches of rain fell on coastal 
Venezuela between February 7 and 9, and the rain continues to 
fall.  The President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, signed a 
decree on February 9 declaring a state of emergency in 6 
states (Aragua, Carabobo, Miranda, Vargas, Falcon and 
Yaracuy) and the capital district of Caracas.  The central 
government has set up a committee to oversee all of the 
disaster relief in the country.  There has been no formal 
request for assistance from the GOV; Post believes that the 
GOV will not object to a donation directly to the Red Cross. 
 
¶3. The Ambassador has determined that the flooding is of 
sufficient magnitude to warrant USG assistance, and is 
exercising his disaster assistance authority as per 2 FAM 
sections 060, 061 and 062. 
 
¶4. Post therefore requests that OFDA provide $50,000, which 
will be provided to the Venezuelan chapter of the 
International Red Cross, which will be used to purchase oral 
rehydration equipment, hygiene kits, and drinkable water. 
 
¶5. Given the magnitude of the situation, and the forecast for 
rain to continue intermittently for at least 24 more hours - 
some forecasts predict 6 more days - in the affected areas, 
it is possible that we may request additional funding.  Even 
if the rain should stop or slow in those areas, continued 
rain in other areas could increase flooding in the already 
affected areas.  We also anticipate that the number of 
homeless may be somewhat higher already.  We will remain in 
contact with the OFDA office in San Jose.
