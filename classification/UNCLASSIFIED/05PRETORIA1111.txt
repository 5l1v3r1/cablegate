¶1.  Per reftel, Post welcomes the opportunity to help 
improve the global maritime security framework.  The Port of 
Durban is the largest of South Africa's seven ports and the 
busiest in Africa.  Its container terminal is the largest in 
the southern hemisphere.  In addition, it is uniquely 
situated to link North America with the Middle East, India, 
Asia, Africa, and Australia.  Recognizing its significance, 
the United States established a Container Security 
Initiative (CSI) at the port in 2003.  Post is also working 
with the U.S. Coast Guard International Port Security 
Liaison Officer (IPSLO) to plan a visit to South Africa in 
April 2005 which would lay the groundwork for a July 2005 
evaluation of security practices at the Port of Durban. 
 
¶2.  Maritime security issues in the Mission are managed by 
an Economic Officer as well as regional Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE) officers based in South Africa.  The Economic and 
CBP/ICE offices have a good working relationship and 
interact on an ad hoc basis as well as through monthly Law 
Enforcement Working Group (LEWG) meetings.  Although the 
LEWG forum typically devotes its time to addressing law- 
enforcement matters, it also discusses inter-governmental 
collaboration on maritime security concerns such as the 
Container Security Initiative. 
 
¶3.  South Africa's 2006 and 2007 Mission Performance Plans 
(MPP) address maritime security through the "Prevention and 
Response to Terrorism" section.  Its goal is to work with 
South Africa in the war on terror by deepening the 
relationships between USG agencies and their South African 
counterparts, including those involved in maritime security. 
The LEWG is instrumental in the implementation of all 
aspects of this MPP objective. 
 
¶4.  South Africa has repeatedly expressed interest in 
collaborating with the United States on maritime issues.  In 
2003, the South African government contacted the Embassy to 
express formal interest in entering into Search and Rescue 
and Maritime agreements.  Earlier this year, the Ports of 
Cape Town and Durban entered into International Sister 
Seaport agreements with the Port of Miami-Dade to cooperate 
in areas of trade, tourism, and development.  In addition, 
U.S. Customs Commissioner Robert Bonner and South Africa 
Customs Commissioner Pravin Gordhan successfully lobbied the 
World Customs Organization to adopt supply chain security 
measures.  They ultimately hope to persuade the World Trade 
Organization to endorse these supply chain standards as 
well.  Post believes that fertile ground exists in South 
Africa for expanded cooperation on maritime security.
