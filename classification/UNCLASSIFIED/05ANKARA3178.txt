Â¶1.  We met with MFA's 2nd Secretary Ozlem Kural to deliver 
reftel demarche on June 3.  Ms. Kural has newly taken up her 
position.  She opined that the Tier 2 placement is "good" 
since, in her view, the GOT has worked hard on this issue in 
the past year.  She mentioned that the GOT and the Government 
of Ukraine will sign a protocol and readmission agreement on 
June 7.  She reported that when FM Gul next travels to 
Moldova, he will sign similar agreements.
