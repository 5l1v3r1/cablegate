SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: AHAMADINEJAD'S VISIT TO BRAZIL 
 
"Lula Scores Against Himself" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (11-25) notes: 
"[Iran's President] did not provide the slightest sign in any of 
his public statements or signed documents....that his host 
President Lula could evoke as evidence that he did the right thing 
in inviting Ahmadinejad....[who] did not give up in 
anything.....The world does not distrust Brazil's intentions 
[regarding the use of nuclear energy]. But Iran's credibility is 
nil....There is no reason to think that this will change due to 
Lula's requests....The GOB's triumphant fantasies about its ability 
to influence major global issues....has led the president to open 
his arms to Ahmadinejad.  More than a useless initiative, [the 
invitation] was a self-inflicted setback.  As Lula would say, a 
score against itself." 
 
 
 
"Balanced Reception" 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (11-25) states:"....[In 10 
days Brazil received three of the primary Middle East leaders]. 
President Lula's challenge was to deal with these players in a 
historical conflict..... [in a balanced way.]  This balance of 
interests and values was achieved this time.....[Lula's 
administration usually fails in] saying the right things, at the 
right moment, in right place and through the right diplomatic 
channels....Fortunately, this mistake was not repeated in 
Ahmadinejad's visit to Brasilia.....It is through the example of 
peaceful sociability between citizens from different ethnicities 
and religions -  and through the repudiation of interventionism - 
that Brazil may have a positive influence, even if moderate, in the 
bloody chess game of the Middle East."
