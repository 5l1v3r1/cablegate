"Chavez loses support due to shortage and inflation" 
 
Business-oriented Valor Econtmico (4/8) states: "Since losing the 
December referendum that would change the Constitution, President 
Hugo Chavez' popularity has declined systematically...there are 
shortages of bread, milk and other basic goods in supermarkets while 
prices keep soaring. Venezuela already has the highest rate of 
inflation in Latin America... . The economic policies of the 
president [Chavez] are to blame for the significant distortions the 
country faces nowadays... .The endless nationalizations...overvalued 
exchange rate...creation of a severe law to fight stocking of 
goods...criminalizing the release of the exchange rate on the black 
market...trying to deter imports...limiting credit card purchases... 
are cosmetic measures that will not bring balance back to the 
economy and, therefore, will affect Chavez' popularity even more at 
a time when he needs to win a new political battle. There will be 
elections for governor in the second semester and the 
opposition...may win and crack the until now monolithic power model 
of the Bolivarian leader.
