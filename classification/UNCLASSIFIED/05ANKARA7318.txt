     Control Division published its fourth and final report on 
     Avian Influenza (AI)on December 8, 2005 and submitted it to 
     the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE). 
  ¶2.   The report declares that the country is free of AI and 
     indicates that the complete quarantine is lifted. 
¶3.   The report also summarizes the AI outbreak in Turkey as 
follows: the outbreak started on October 1, 2005, in a small 
turkey farm in the Manyas District of Balikesir province, a 
sparsely populated area.  In total, 1700 turkeys died of AI 
and 100 more were destroyed on that farm. 
  ¶4.   There have been no new outbreaks of Avian Influenza 
     (AI) in Turkey since the October outbreak.  The GOT

     good surveillance of any suspicious bird deaths in the 
     country.
