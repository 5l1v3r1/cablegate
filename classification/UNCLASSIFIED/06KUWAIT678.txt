¶1.  (U) According to Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) and confirmed 
by MFA Undersecretary Khaled Al-Jarallah, on Monday, February 
27, the GOK Council of Ministers (cabinet) authorized a $10 
million grant for Iraq, half for the restoration of the 
Shrine of the Two Imams mosque in Samarra and half for other 
mosques damaged in the recent attacks. 
 
¶2.  (U) KUNA reports that the official GOK statement, issued 
on behalf of the Amir by Deputy Prime Minister and State 
Minister for Cabinet and National Assembly Affairs Mohammad 
Dhaifallah Sharar, underscored the Kuwaiti people's support 
for their Iraqi brethren and demonstrated Kuwait's 
willingness to "help the Iraqis cope with the crisis and 
substantiate their national unity." 
 
¶3.  (U) This donation marks the second time in recent months 
the GOK has responded with timely assistance to Iraqis in 
response to sectarian violence.  In September 2005, the GOK 
provided immediate medical and financial assistance ($10 
million) for victims of the August 31 bridge stampede in 
Baghdad (see ref C).
