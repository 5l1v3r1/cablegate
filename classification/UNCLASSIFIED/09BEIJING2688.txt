  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  U.S.-CHINA TRADE 
 
"U.S. pressures China and India on emissions reduction before the 
G20" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/18)(pg 11): "China and India have made 
significant progress on environmental protection  and economic 
development in recent years.  He Weiwen, at the China WTO Studies 
Institute, said that 30% of China's annual carbon emissions come 
from cheap products manufactured for developed countries.  If the 
U.S. implements a carbon tariff, American consumers are the ones who 
will pay the price.  Some countries are using carbon tariffs and 
subsidies to achieve their real goal of cracking down on and 
implementing protectionist policies against developing countries. 
The U.S. has carefully considered this issue in advance of the G20 
summit.  It is the continued policy of the United States to force 
China and India to make compromises on climate change and emissions 
reduction." 
 
"Once again the U.S. launches an anti-dumping investigation on 
Chinese steel pipes" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/18)(pg 11): "A Chinese official said that 
[the U.S. decision to start an anti-dumping investigation on Chinese 
steel pipes] is not good news.  Protectionism will trigger a chain 
reaction, provoking more and more such measures.  Zhang Yansheng, 
Director of the Foreign Economic Studies Department at the National 
Development and Reform Commission, said the U.S. and India always 
end up implementing severe protectionist measures against other 
countries.  China should immediately respond to the U.S.'s actions 
in order to gain more international support, while at the same time 
making an effort to resolve the dispute.  This does not mean, 
however, that there has to be a trade war with the U.S.  Moreover, 
the nature of China's countervailing and anti-dumping investigations 
on U.S. [poultry and auto] products is different from the U.S. 
special protection case on tires.  They are incomparable." 
 
¶2.  U.S.-NORTH KOREA 
 
"U.S. and North Korea may hold talks this fall; South Korea reminds 
U.S. not to forget denuclearization" 
 
The official popular newspaper Beijing Youth Daily (Beijing 
Qingnianbao)(09/18)(pg A29): "According to South Korean media, 
bilateral talks between the U.S. and North Korea may take place in 
October.  South Korean officials stress that while they support the 
improvement in U.S.-North Korean relations, the principle of a 
denuclearized North Korea should not be forgotten in bilateral talks 
and the two countries should not ignore North-South Korean 
relations.  A senior diplomat said that the U.S. and North Korea 
have established contact through their delegations at the UN and are 
discussing the content and form of bilateral talks.  The U.S. is 
trying to get North Korea to return to the Six-Party Talks without 
losing face, but it is also trying to avoid having direct nuclear 
talks with the North."
