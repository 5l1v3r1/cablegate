center organizes numerous conferences on subjects such as 
public relations, community skills, strategic planning and 
management techniques.  LAU also conducts studies and 
environmental programs on air quality management in urban and 
industrial areas.  These programs continue to analyze the 
statistical validity of existing air pollution database 
information to develop optimal long-term air pollution 
monitoring programs.  LAU carries out health impact analysis, 
investigates air quality management alternatives and public 
policy choices, and analyzes costs and benefits of 
alternative policy options to reduce air pollution.  LAU also 
offers workshops to present and discuss the findings of the 
studies and to launch action plans with interested parties.

exchange), Post examined available information regarding the 
Board of Directors of LAU, with the finding of no adverse 
information.  This includes further due diligence on two 
members: Mohammad Safadi and Gilbert Chagoury.  No further 
action was deemed necessary.
