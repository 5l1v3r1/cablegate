¶1. (U) Summary:  During his February 14-17 visit to Sudan, 
Congressman Alan Grayson (D-Florida) met with Dr. Migdam Elsheikh 
Abdelgani, Director of the National Centre for Research (NCR) in 
Khartoum to talk about the work of its 13 research institutes and 
its premier Renewable Energy Institute (REI.)  The REI has produced 
green alternatives to chemicals used in agriculture and developed 
renewable building materials.  Congressman Grayson also met on 
February 15 with Professor Taib Idriss, Undersecretary in the 
Ministry of Science and Technology who said that the Government of 
National Unity (GoNU) has provided 1.8 million rural residents with 
solar lights and batteries.  The DCM hosted a dinner for the 
Congressman during which he met representatives of International 
Non-Governmental Organizations to discuss their progress and 
challenges in doing humanitarian work in Sudan.  In Darfur, 
Congressman Grayson observed World Food Program operations and saw, 
first-hand, how solar energy and biomass are being incorporated to 
improve living conditions for IDPs in the camps.  End Summary

NCR Develops Solar, Eco-Friendly Solutions 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
¶2. (U) U.S. Representative Alan Grayson visited Sudan from February 
14-17 to investigate the use of renewable technology and solar 
energy.  During the Congressman's February 15 visit to the National 
Centre for Research (NCR), a division of the Ministry of Science 
and Technology whose mandate is to apply scientific research to the 
country's social and economic development, Dr. Migdam Elsheikh 
Abdelgani, Director, told Grayson that the Centre's 13 institutes 
conduct research in a wide range of disciplines, including tropical 
medicine, genetic engineering, biotechnology and sustainable 
development.  According to Abdelgani, the NCR has 238 researchers 
of which 28 percent are women.  NCR scientists and officials 
prepare a five-year strategic plan identifying which projects to 
recommend for approval by the Government of National Unity (GNU). 
However, the Director said, NCR has no decision-making authority 
about which projects to work on, nor about how much to spend on 
each project. 
 
¶3. (U) The establishment of the Renewable Energy Institute (REI) 
has been among the NCR's most notable achievements, said Abdelgani. 
REI produces photocells for use in solar energy projects, and 
developed alternatives to chemicals used in agriculture, replacing 
chemical-based pesticides with eco-friendly alternatives and bio 
fertilizers.  The institute also developed techniques for 
constructing low cost buildings using local materials, resulting in 
savings on the transportation costs of importing building 
materials.  Abdulghani said the REI has fabricated roofing made 
from local materials and built machines to make bricks for building 
projects. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Congressman Grayson asked how the NCR determines if the 
GNU-approved projects have a positive impact on the public. 
Abdulghani said that the GNU conducts field tests and obtains 
feedback from the local community.  If a local community identifies 
a problem, NCR will respond by assigning researchers to conduct 
studies and suggest solutions, he said.  NCR's research findings 
are published in journals in English and in Arabic.  Responding to 
Congressman Grayson's question on the NCR/REI's annual budget, the 
Director said the Ministry of Finance controls all funds, a primary 
reason why projects can take a long time to complete.  He said that 
research is slowed further because the GNU does not provide 
incentives for private companies to conduct independent research. 
Congressman Grayson explained the U.S. model for applying for 
federal research grants as well as the decision-making process for 
approval.  He emphasized that using expert panels to review and 
approve grant proposals helps to spur robust competition among 
universities and the private sector for funding.

¶5. (SBU) Congressman Grayson also met on February 15 with Professor 
Taib Idriss, Undersecretary in the Ministry of Science and 
Technology.  Idriss told the Congressman that Sudan, like Phoenix, 
Arizona, has more than 10 hours of sunlight per day and at 46 
degrees Celsius (114.8 F) sustains the optimal conditions for the 
maximum use of solar energy.  The use of solar panels can generate 
great savings in this environment, Idriss said.  Fully 70 percent 
of Sudan's population of 40 million people live in its 300,000 
villages, many of which are difficult to reach because roads are 
 
KHARTOUM 00000314  002 OF 002 
 
 
impassable.  The GNU has begun providing solar street lights, 
portable solar lamps, mobile charging units, and energy for the 
services sector to people in rural areas, and is reaching out to 
schools, clinics and religious institutions in villages with 
100-500 families, with the goal of reaching 1.8 million residents 
with solar power.  (Bio Note: Dr. Idris is an alumnus of the 
International Visitors Program in the mid 1990's.  He also served 
as a coordinator for USAID projects from 1983-1990.  End Bio Note.)

WFP to Develop Use of Biomass As Cooking Fuel 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------------

¶6. (U) In Darfur on February 16, Congressman Grayson visited the 
World Food Program (WFP's) North Darfur facility.  WFP 
representative, Ali Reza, said WFP plans to develop the use of 
biomass to help people in the internally displaced persons (IDPs) 
camps.  By diversifying into biomass, WFP will promote the use of 
biomass as a fuel to replace wood.  Women are often assaulted and 
raped when they go outside the camps to collect firewood for 
cooking; the use of biomass will reduce the need to leave the camps 
to collect fuel.  In addition, the use of biomass will help improve 
waste management in the camps by encouraging the recycling of 
household waste and garbage. 
 
¶7. (U) WFP officials demonstrated to Congressman Grayson a stove 
developed at the University of California-Berkeley that uses dried 
compost from food waste and other bio matter for fuel.  Unlike 
solar cookers, the stoves can be used in much the same way as 
wood-burning stoves.  WFP's Reza told Congressman Grayson that WFP 
has a pilot project in Kabkabia Town where it has distributed 5,000 
Berkeley Stoves.  The program has been in operation for only one 
month, Reza said, so impact studies are not yet available. 
However, the program is expected to improve the safety of women and 
to reduce deforestation resulting from the collection of firewood 
in the surrounding areas.  The Congressman also visited Abu Shouk 
IDP Camp in El Fasher, to see solar cookers in use. 
 
¶8. (U) At the WFP distribution center in El Fasher, North Darfur, 
the WFP provides USAID-purchased sorghum, vegetable oil, salt and 
other commodities to thousands of internally displaced persons 
(IDPs).  In describing WFP's food distribution system Reza said 
USAID partners manage the physical distribution of food by issuing 
ration cards as part of a strict registration and verification 
process.  The food aid benefits 190,000 thousand children and 418 
schools.  Despite these efforts, Reza said that in North Darfur, 
there still exists an alarming rate of malnutrition among children 
under five years.

Grayson Meets with Humanitarian Community 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) DCM hosted Congressman Grayson February 15 for a dinner with 
representatives of non-governmental organizations active in 
providing humanitarian assistance in Darfur.  The Congressman 
commended the representatives of the humanitarian organizations for 
their willingness to be on the front line of disaster relief, and 
recounted from personal experience a chance meeting with a child 
who told the Congressman U.S. food aid had saved his family from 
starvation. 
 
¶10. (U) Congressman Grayson did not have the opportunity to clear 
this cable prior to departing post.
