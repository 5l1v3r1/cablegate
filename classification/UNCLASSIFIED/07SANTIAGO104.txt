Â¶1. On January 18,  Megavision's morning news program featured a 
commentary by international pundit Libardo Buitrago on Iran's 
President Ahmadinejad to Latin America.  He said, "He is a very 
controversial President of a Muslim, religious, Shiite nation.... 
He has a particular relationship with Hugo Chavez.  They are 
friends, and Chavez introduced him to other friends in Latin 
America....  Iran wants to be a nuclear power.  He has been accused 
of supporting international terrorism and guerrilla groups....  The 
goal of Iran's President is to eliminate Israel from the globe.... 
They have given arms to Hezbollah....  We need to be careful with 
this visit."
