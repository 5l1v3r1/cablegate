II. COMPLETED ACTIONS FOR REPORTING PERIOD (KABUL, AFGHANISTAN): 
 
¶A. Site Assessments and Meetings held during this Reporting Period. 
 
¶1. (U) The Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program 
has been working with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI) 
to establish a modern Import/Export licensing system.  Bearing Point 
Management and Technology Consultants have been contracted to 
provide the equipment and training. Deloitte Consulting LLP has been 
contracted to install the equipment. The equipment was delivered to 
the Embassy in April, 2009.  On June 9, 2009 the EXBS staff met with 
Gerald Turcott, Senior Manager of Deloittle to inventory the 
equipment and discuss arrangements for delivery to MoCI. 
 
 
¶2. (U) The EXBS staff met with Afghan Deputy Minister for Customs 
and Revenues Mr. Gul Magsood Sabit and his Executive Assistant Mr. 
Khalilullah Salihzada to discuss future cooperation, equipment and 
training that can be provided by EXBS. Mr. Sabit stated that he is 
very grateful for the equipment and assistance that the United 
States has provided to date. The Advisor informed the Deputy 
Minister that EXBS is conducting market research for fire fighting 
equipment.  The fire fighting equipment will be placed at commercial 
cargo facilities and ports of entry.  The Deputy Minister also 
requested additional training on the new x-rays that EXBS provided. 
The Director is very interested in getting enforcement training 
institutionalized in the Customs academy. The Advisor informed the 
Director about the training program for host government academy 
instructors that is held at FLETC with follow-up visits to the host 
country by FLETC instructors. 
 
¶3. (U) EXBS met with representatives from Allied Machinery to 
discuss repairs and maintenance on two thirteen-ton forklifts that 
are scheduled to be delivered to Heart and Jalalabad Inland Customs 
Depots. ISN/ECC will provide two fund cites for the repairs and 
delivery.  EXBS has requested that GSO Procurement secure a company 
that can deliver EXBS donated equipment to BCP sites on the Afghan 
borders. 
 
¶4.  (U) On May 19, 2009 the EXBS staff delivered a new Toyota 
Corolla patrol vehicle to the Director of Kabul International

¶B. Training Conducted During Report Period. 
 
¶1. None 
 
¶C. Training Programs Pending. 
 
¶1. (U) EXBS delivered a diplomatic Note to the Government of 
Afghanistan inviting them to send three participants to the United 
Nations Resolution 1540 Workshop.  The Workshop will be held June 23 
- 25 in Colombo, Sri Lanka and hosted by the Governments of Sri 
Lanka and the United States. EXBS was informed by MFA that the 
Afghan Desk Officer assigned to work with the UN is working on the 
logistics. EXBS Afghanistan has requested that ISN/ECC provide 
funding for a Resolution 1540 Workshop in Kabul, Afghanistan.  This 
workshop would provide the information to produce documentation that 
would result in satisfying Afghanistan's UNSCR 1540 submissions. 
The previous EXBS Advisor has made inquires to the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs on this proposed event and all the associated 
Ministries having a stake in UNSCR 1540 are supportive of this 
workshop.  EXBS headquarters has indicated a willingness to fund and 
sponsor the 1540 workshop.  The EXBS workshop will consist of a 
cross section of more than 13 Ministries.  Opportunities for 
ministries to interact and network on issues of non-proliferation 
are rare.  EXBS is providing an important vehicle to bring 
Ministries routinely together.  EXBS hopes that the knowledge gained 
by the three participants to the Resolution 1540 Workshop in Sri 
Lanka will greatly enhance their ability to implement 1540 in 
Afghanistan. 
 
¶2. (U) EXBS delivered a Diplomatic Note to the Government of 
Afghanistan inviting them to send three participants to the tenth 
International Export Control Conference in Istanbul, Turkey on June 
25 - 27, 2009. The Governments of Turkey and the United States will 
co-host the event. Officials from more then sixty countries have 
been invited to attend the conference. The Ministry provided three 
names to EXBS.  The names were provided to the conference 
implementers. 
 
¶3. (U) EXBS has entered into an agreement with BMTF to use BMFT 
Mentors located near border crossing posts and Inland Cargo Depots 
(ICDs) as trainers on selected EXBS equipment. The trainers will 
have experience as border inspectors and knowledgeable on the 
equipment. This agreement was reached because of the difficulty EXBS 
has in traveling to certain areas within Afghanistan due to the 
increased security concerns. BMTF Mentors stationed at Islam Qualah 
and Towr Kham Border Crossing Points (BCPs) have provided training 
on Busters and assorted inspection tools. The Mentors will train 
Customs and Border Police Officers assigned to the ports on the 
equipment and then turn the equipment over to Customs. Like kind 
inspection equipment is being planned for the Border Police 
stationed at the BCPs.  On the more technical equipment, subject 
matter experts will be required to conduct training on the radiation 
and metal detection/identification devices.  Once a source for this 
training has been identified and the training completed, this 
equipment can be fielded immediately. The EXBS office continues to 
work with ISN/ECC to find an acceptable source for this training. 
Getting the equipment out to the BCPs is a top EXBS priority. 
 
 
¶4. (U) The Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI) provided the 
Embassy with an official notice stating that they welcome the 
assistance of the Embassy and EXBS in developing a new Export 
Control Law (Strategic Goods Act).   This law, based on European 
 
KABUL 00001498  003 OF 003 
 
 
Union (EU) models of similar laws, will incorporate control lists 
and provide the legal foundation to institutionalize controls on the 
movement of weapons of mass destruction and their precursors.  EXBS 
provided funds to translate a version of a model EU law into Dari. 
The model EU law will serve as a starting point for the MoCI to 
draft their Strategic Goods bill. Other key stake holders such as 
the Ministry of Finance (Customs) and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs have expressed their commitments to getting this draft 
legislation completed. 
This project will build capacity for the Afghan government in the 
area of non-proliferation controls and will provide a legal 
foundation for the use of international Control Lists and Import, 
Export and Transshipment controls for the movement of Weapons of 
Mass Destruction. The new hardware and software will automate their 
current license control system.  This effort will include a database 
that can efficiently manage licensing approvals as well as give the 
law enforcement community better visibility of the movement of all 
shipments in and out of Afghanistan. Until recently, due to security 
concerns in the Kabul area, EXBS was unable to provide follow-up 
legislative development assistance.  ISN/ECC is in the process of 
scheduling this assistance. 
 
 
III. RED FLAG ISSUES: 
 
¶1. (U) No Red Flag Issues to report.
