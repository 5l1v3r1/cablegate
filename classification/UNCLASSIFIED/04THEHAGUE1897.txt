SUBJECT: DUTCH WILL ASK U.S. TO JOIN FRIENDS OF SUDAN GROUP 
 
¶1.  Dutch Director for Africa Roeland van de Geer and Marieke 
van Renssen, Acting Sudan desk officer,  told emboffs in 
separate meetings today that the GONL intends to invite the 
US to join a "Friends of Sudan" group to assist in the 
post-crisis reconstruction of the Darfur region.  The Dutch 
will also ask the UK and Norway to join. The Dutch mission to 
Sudan will approach the US and UK embassies in Khartoum 
regarding membership as early as this week.  The MFA,s 
Deputy Director for Africa Norbert Braakhuis will also 
discuss membership with Special Advisor for Sudan Mike 
Ranneberger on July 28. 
 
¶2.  Van de Geer told econoff that he and Minister of 
Development Agnes van Ardenne are preparing the group's 
"terms of reference."  They will form the group in Khartoum 
late the week of July 26 or early the week of August 2.  He 
suggested the group could then begin planning a &joint donor 
approach8 for Darfur.  Membership would not be limited to 
The Netherlands, Norway, UK and US, but could eventually 
include other donor nations. 
 
¶3.  Speaking in an interview earlier this week, van Ardenne 
announced she would allocate 100 million Euros for Darfur 
reconstruction which, according to van Renssen, would be made 
available after a North-South peace agreement.  At the same 
time, van Ardenne floated the idea of forming a "Friends of 
Darfur" group to raise money and, with the Sudanese 
government, coordinate expenditures for Darfur 
reconstruction. Van Ardenne said she hopes the prospect of 
post conflict assistance will persuade warring parties to 
return to the negotiating table.
