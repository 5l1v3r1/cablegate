¶1. (U) SUMMARY: The Peacebuilding Center for the Horn of Africa 
(PCHA) is concluding its fifth USG-funded workshop for eastern 
Sudanese NGO leaders.  The week long workshop invited 29 
participants from the four previous workshops to attend a final 
session on "training the trainers."  Embassy officers visited the 
workshop, lecturing on the importance of strengthening grassroots 
efforts.  End Summary. 
 
ENTHUSIASTIC AND READY 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Participants greeted visiting EmbOffs with energetic chants 
of "abune ta-eez, Obama ra-eez," which roughly translates to 
"without discrimination, Obama is President."  The 29 participants, 
attendees from the four previous workshops, volunteered to attend a 
fifth workshop on educating fellow community members on the 
mechanics of peacebuilding.  Participants represented a range of 
political parties such as the SPLM, the Democratic Unionist Party 
(DUP), the Sudan Communist Party (SCP), and the Eastern Sudan Front 
(ESF).  Participants were also members of a variety of civic society 
organizations, including adult education centers, youth movements, 
women's movements, legal activists, and so forth. 
 
¶3. (U) The PCHA facilitated this "training the trainers" method by 
producing a 100-page instruction manual in Arabic outlining the 
PCHA's approach to community building in eastern Sudan.  The 
workshop also invited guest lecturers on topics such as energizing 
community organizations in eastern Sudan. 
 
GRASSROOTS VS. TREE ROOTS 
------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) In much of eastern Sudan the local perspective is that the 
most powerful politician runs the community and is the person with 
whom to align, according to the impromptu survey PolOff conducted 
among the participants.  PolOff guest lectured the group on the 
importance of sustaining and strengthening grassroots movements 
instead of seeking powerful "tree roots" (such as a single 
influential governor) to cluster around.  The participants, enthused 
by the concept, requested Arabic translations of the presentation 
and volleyed dozens of questions afterwards on different ways to 
promote grassroots movements in eastern Sudan.  Participants 
particularly liked the idea of door-to-door canvassing. 
 
¶5. (U) The implementation of the 5th workshop concludes the 
USG-funded five workshop series on peacebuilding in eastern Sudan. 
The first four workshops were funded by an ESF grant, while the 
Sudan Programs Group (AF/SPG) funded a 5th workshop extension.  Thus 
far, all of the workshops have been well attended (reftel) and have 
received accolades from several diplomatic missions and high-ranking 
officials in the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), 
Eritrea's sole political party. 
 
¶6. (U) COMMENT: Peace efforts in eastern Sudan are one of the few 
areas of political commonality shared between the USG, the Eritrean 
government, and the Government of Sudan.  The five workshops, though 
occasionally delayed due to scheduling difficulties, were a success 
and demonstrated the enthusiasm of community leaders from eastern 
Sudan in strengthening civil society in their region.
