Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Ha'aretz reported that the Bush administration is making efforts to 
train the Presidential Guard of Palestinian Authority Chairman 
Mahmoud Abbas in order to prepare it for a potential violent 
confrontation with Hamas forces in the Gaza Strip.  According to the 
paper, General Keith Dayton, the American security coordinator in 
the territories, appeared before representatives of the Quartet in 
London last week and presented them with a program that calls for 
Egyptian, British and perhaps even Jordanian instructors to train 
forces loyal to Abbas.  The paper also quoted Palestinian sources as 
saying that the training of a "Special Presidential Guard" started 
already a month ago, under the guidance of an American military 
instructor in Jericho. 
 
Yediot reported that a deal involving abducted Israeli soldier Gilad 
Shalit is entering its crucial stage.  The paper reported that a 
delegation of the Hamas movement in Damascus has arrived in Cairo 
for meetings with Egyptian Intelligence Minister Omar Suleiman, who 
has been charged with the issue.  The paper also cited Palestinian 
Prime Minister Ismail Haniya as saying that serious efforts are made 
in order to finalize the prisoner exchange deal. 
 
Israel Radio quoted Lebanese security sources and eye witnesses as 
saying that IAF warplanes flew at a low altitude over Beirut, its 
suburbs and large areas of South Lebanon on Tuesday. 
 
Maariv reported that Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Moratinos is 
initiating a second Madrid Convention with Syria and Iran.  The 
paper reported that Russia is in favor and that the negotiations 
with the US are ongoing. 
 
Israel Radio cited US Ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton, 
as expressing concern that Syria and Iran are trying to destabilize 
Lebanon's democratically elected government by violating the UN arms 
embargo. He was also quoted as calling upon Syrian President Bashar 
Assad to abide by the commitment he made to Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan to support the resolution [1701] and the arms embargo. 
 
Leading media cited Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as saying 
that Iran shall supply "A harsh and appropriate response" to any 
attempt to sanction it. 
Ha'aretz reported that in his meeting with the Knesset's Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Committee, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that 
a decision on how to handle the situation in Gaza will be decided in 
the coming days. Maariv reported that Olmert also told the committee 
that the operation will expand. 
 
Israel Radio reported that IDF troops killed two Hamas militants 
Tuesday morning in the southern Gaza Strip. The radio also quoted 
Palestinian security sources as reporting that an Israeli naval 
vessel fired at two Palestinian boats near the Gaza coast on 
Tuesday, wounding two fishermen and later detaining several people 
on board. 
 
All media reported that in a General Staff meeting held on Monday it 
was decided that none of the four commanders of the divisions that 
fought in the war in Lebanon will lose his job.   The media noted 
that Defense Minister Amir Peretz still needs to approve the 
decision. 
 
All media reported that the Knesset approved Avigdor Lieberman's 
appointment to Minister for Strategic Affairs.  The Jerusalem Post 
reported that Lieberman is already slated to visit the US on 
December 8, 2006 to take part in the Saban Forum at the Saban Center 
for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
 
All media reported that Ophir Pines [Labor party], Minister of 
Science, Culture and Sports have resigned following Labor party's 
decision to support Lieberman's entry into the coalition. The media 
speculated who will replace him; among the names raised was the one 
of former Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Maariv reported that PM Olmert 
said in closed talks that Israel needs Barak in the government. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak yesterday 
denied reports in Egypt that its security forces had beefed up their 
presence on the border with the Gaza Strip. 
 
Ha'aretz cited a source close to President Moshe Katzav as saying 
that the President is considering asking the Knesset for a leave of 
"temporary incapacity" if the attorney general decides to indict 
him.

¶1. Mideast: 
----------- 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Senior diplomatic correspondent Shimon Shiffer wrote in 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot: "Information that has 
arrived from Washington has led some to the conclusion that the Bush 
administration intends to launch a new, far-reaching initiative 
before the end of 2006 that will change the status quo in the Middle 
East." 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: "The Gaza Strip's 
economy is being destroyed, and its reconstruction depends on 
setting up a moderate government of Hamas and Fatah.... Meanwhile, 
the rampant smuggling of rockets intended to strike at Israeli 
communities and missiles aimed against IDF tanks and aircraft 
continues.  The smuggling is pushing the IDF to recommend an 
extensive operation in the Gaza Strip ... The key to the crisis is 
in Cairo.  Egypt must wake up and turn the key before the IDF rushes 
in and breaks the lock." 
 
Veteran op-ed writer Eitan Haber wrote in the lead editorial of 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Ahahronot: "It is convenient for 
every one to deal with the outposts: the US president, Condoleezza 
Rice, Ehud Olmert, Amir Peretz and others.... Damn it, why does it 
matter and to who?

¶I. "Come Up With a New Initiative" 
 
Senior diplomatic correspondent Shimon Shiffer wrote in 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (10/31): "In [PM] 
Olmert's surroundings one can recognize two opposing views. The 
first view vaunts waiting: sit and do nothing. The second view is 
that Israel needs to brainstorm and to step forward with a political 
initiative of its own before it finds itself being led by the nose 
with international initiatives.... Information that has arrived from 
Washington has led some to the conclusion that the Bush 
administration intends to launch a new, far-reaching initiative 
before the end of 2006 that will change the status quo in the Middle 
East.  At the center of this initiative will be a plan for a gradual 
withdrawal from Iraq.  The administration is also expected to engage 
in dialogue with member countries of the 'axis of evil,' Iran and 
Syria.  The Bush administration will explain that these channels of 
dialogue are crucial for achieving calm in Iraq.  The departure of 
the Americans from Iraq will have dramatic ramifications on Israel's 
security and the expected dialogue between the Americans and Iran 
and Syria.  Olmert is likely to hear about the crystallization of 
that initiative in the course of his visit to Washington.  Senior 
political officials say that Olmert would do well were he to arrive 
in American with proposals of his own before the pressure on him to 
accept the proposals of others began." 
 
II. "Egypt's Obligation" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (10/31): "Two 
interrelated issues sit at the center of Israel's expectations of 
Egypt: the release of abducted soldier Gilad Shalit, and closure of 
the gate for weapons and explosives smuggling into the Gaza Strip. 
If Egypt continues to talk meekly and act weakly, it may lead to an 
escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian relationship, which it would 
like to avoid.  The escalation, which may also include a broad IDF 
ground operation in residential areas close to the Egyptian border, 
will also have a negative effect on relations between Jerusalem and 
Cairo.... Despite Egypt's concerns over the strengthening of 
extremists, it is behaving as if it is comfortable with a bleeding 
and anxious Israel. The price the Palestinians have paid to date 
stands at 300 dead.... The Gaza Strip's economy is being destroyed, 
and its reconstruction depends on setting up a moderate government 
of Hamas and Fatah, but even such a move is being delayed until 
Shalit is released.  Meanwhile, the rampant smuggling of rockets 
intended to strike at Israeli communities and missiles aimed against 
IDF tanks and aircraft continues.  The smuggling is pushing the IDF 
to recommend an extensive operation in the Gaza Strip before the 
arms build-up reaches a scale similar to Hezbollah in Lebanon.  The 
key to the crisis is in Cairo.  Egypt must wake up and turn the key 
before the IDF rushes in and breaks the lock." 
 
III. "Leave the Outposts Alone" 
 
Veteran op-ed writer Eitan Haber wrote in the lead editorial of 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Ahahronot (10/31): "It is 
convenient for every one to deal with the outposts: the US 
president, Condoleezza Rice, Ehud Olmert, Amir Peretz and others. 
All day long, all the newspapers, outposts 'hora' [a Israeli folk 
dance]: to built, to destroy, to establish, to dismantle. Damn it, 
why does it matter and to who? If some day they decide to dismantle 
the settlements in the West Bank or parts of it, they will turn the 
outposts into dust.  If they decide to stay forever in the West Bank 
the outposts will turn into blooming gardens.  In our short, 
complicated and conflicted history our leaders have managed to prove 
(mainly Begin and Sharon) that they know how to do both: to build 
and to destroy."

¶2. Iran: 
-------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: "Time is 
running out, and Israel and others who recognize the threat [by 
Iran] owe it to themselves and to the rest of the international 
community to strenuously encourage non-military action before it is 
too late."

"Before its Too Late" 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (10/31): "As 
Iran closes in on a nuclear capability week by week, that 'luxury' 
of taking a back seat while the world does nothing to thwart the 
program becomes one that Israel can increasingly ill-afford. 
Israel, it must be stressed, does not seek military intervention in 
Iran.  It has reasonably expected that the international community 
would internalize the threat posed by Teheran and would rapidly take 
concerted action short of military force to deter the Iranians.  But 
in the face of determined international foot-dragging, if not 
downright apathy, the last thing Israel can allow itself is to 'wait 
and see' what, if anything, the EU, US, Russia and China intend to 
do.  Time is running out, and Israel and others who recognize the 
threat owe it to themselves and to the rest of the international 
community to strenuously encourage non-military action before it is 
too late."
