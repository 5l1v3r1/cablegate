Weaker Rand, More Inflation Likely for SA 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Industry analysts report that a prolonged global financial 
crisis could curb capital inflows to South Africa and weaken the 
rand.  The good news is that the financial sector, which makes up a 
20% of South Africa's economy, is not heavily exposed to the 
offshore credit lines snapped by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. 
The bad news is that if the rand depreciates further, the trend will 
re-ignite local inflation and delay the interest rate cuts that 
markets had expected next year.  It would also postpone a recovery 
in economic growth, which is expected to slow to just above 3% this 
year, from just over 5% last year.  If global investors remain risk 
averse, it will be difficult for South Africa to attract the capital 
needed to finance its huge current account deficit.  That would put 
pressure on the rand, which has already depreciated about 15% 
against the dollar this year.  A continued decline of mineral prices 
would also erode the value of exports and widen the deficit.  The 
main threat is whether the U.S. economy tips into a recession and 
how this will affect emerging giants such as China.  (Business Day, 
September 16, 2008) 
 
-------------------------------------- 
No Surprises in SARB Governor's Speech 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Governor Tito Mboweni 
reiterated the SARB's commitment to price stability during a speech 
to shareholders at the SARB's annual general meeting on September 
¶18.  Mboweni also said that South African banks had little direct 
exposure to the U.S. subprime market.  He highlighted the fact that 
the cumulative 500 basis-point hike in interest rates since June 
2006 has contributed to a slowdown in household consumption spending 
growth and a widening of the output gap, which aided in reducing the 
risks to the inflation outlook.  That, together with lower 
international oil prices, prompted the SARB to leave interest rates 
unchanged at the August meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. 
However, Mboweni warned that despite the more positive outlook, the 
SARB remains concerned over rising inflation expectations, stating 
that "... to prevent second-round effects, it is important that 
expectations remain well-anchored.  Failure to respond appropriately 
Qexpectations remain well-anchored.  Failure to respond appropriately 
could inevitably cause expectations to become dislodged and result 
in a further acceleration in inflation."  (ABSA Capital, September 
19.) 
 
------------------------------------ 
SA Falls in Economic Freedom Ranking 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (U) South Africa fell from 49th to 54th place out of 141 
countries in the latest annual Economic Freedom of the World Report. 
 Judiciary independence and impartiality both rated lower in the 
report, which compared data collected in 2006 with that of the 
previous year.  The report measures economic freedom by considering 
factors such as government size, legal system, regulatory 
environment (credit, labor, and business), and access to "sound" 
 
PRETORIA 00002071  002.2 OF 006 
 
 
money that is not eroded by inflation or hindered by foreign 
exchange controls, and freedom to trade internationally.  Free 
Market Foundation Executive Director Leon Louw said, "The single 
most important factor in economic growth is the legal system." 
(Business Day, September 17, 2008) 
 
------------------------- 
SA R&D Expenditure Rising 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) recently released 
its annual national survey on research and development (R&D) 
expenditure in South Africa.  The survey revealed that R&D 
expenditure increased from R14.1 billion ($1.8 billion) in fiscal 
year 2005/2006 to R16.5 billion ($2.06 billion) in fiscal year 
2006/2007. Department of Science and Technology (DST) 
Director-General Dr. Phil Mjwara noted that this put South Africa on 
course to meet its goal of spending 1% of gross domestic product on 
R&D by fiscal year 2008/2009.  Mjwara added that the increasing R&D 
expenditure was an indication of the country's growing participation 
in and progress towards a knowledge-based economy.  The survey 
indicated that most R&D was performed in engineering sciences 
(20.9%), followed by the natural sciences (20.3%), higher education 
(20%), and the medical and health sciences (15.1%).  Mjwara said the 
survey also revealed that the local business sector was the major 
performer and financer of R&D, financing 51.3% of total R&D.  Only 
10.6% of the R&D was financed from abroad.  The survey was 
commissioned by the DST and included comprehensive polling of 
business, government (including the nine science councils), higher 
education, and non-profit organizations.  (BuaNews, September 17, 
2008) 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Textile Group Pleads to Keep China in Check 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Textile and clothing bodies from 17 countries, including 
South Africa, have urged the U.S. to protect industries and tighten 
monitoring procedures when its quota limits on Chinese garments and 
textiles expire next year.  The bodies were concerned that export 
markets could be overrun by cheap Chinese products.  Textile 
Federation of South Africa President Abisha Tembo and Export Council 
for the Clothing Industry Chairman Jack Kipling were among the 
signatories of a letter to U.S. trade representative Susan Schwab 
and the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives last week.  When 
quotas on the products now under safeguard were temporarily lifted 
in 2005, Chinese manufacturers reduced prices by 40%, which led to a 
600% increase in Chinese imports to the U.S.  This triggered the 
imposition of the safeguards that will expire next year.  "As in 
2005, the stakes at risk are enormous for export sectors in Africa, 
Central America, the Middle East, the Andean region and Mexico.  The 
safeguards have preserved $37 billion worth of trade in exports, and 
helped keep ... one million jobs.  In non-safeguard areas the story 
is much different ... where billions of dollars in business have 
been lost to China and its unfair trade practices," the letter said. 
 The U.S. is an attractive market for developing country apparel and 
textile exports.  However, China has taken 60% of the U.S. market 
Qtextile exports.  However, China has taken 60% of the U.S. market 
share in product segments where imports are not limited by quotas.

Sanlam Establishes Joint Venture with 
  Leading Indian Brokerage House 
------------------------------------- 
 
 
¶7. (U) Sanlam Investments took a strategic step into the 
fast-growing Indian market by establishing a joint venture with 
India's fourth-largest securities house SMC.  Sanlam Investments 
will contribute $22.5 million to capitalize the ventures.  Sanlam 
Investments CEO Johan Van der Merwe said this was the first step in 
its Indian investment strategy and would be a springboard for 
further expansion in the subcontinent and synergies with Sanlam's 
other businesses.  SMC is one of India's fastest-growing retail 
brokerage houses, with a national network of more than 1,350 
offices.  SMC CEO Subhash Aggarwal reported that its customer base 
topped 400,000 and rose by 10,000 on a monthly basis.  Sanlam said 
India had "massive untapped potential", with $2 trillion in cash 
deposits in a country where more than 90% of potential investors did 
 
PRETORIA 00002071  003.2 OF 006 
 
 
not use financial market instruments.  India's national savings rate 
is about 30%, and is supported by a rapidly rising middle-class and 
income standards.  "Our projections show that if we capture only 
between 2% and 5% of the expected $1 trillion market by 2015, our 
business in India could contribute a significant portion to group 
profits," Van der Merwe noted.  (Business Day, September 17, 2008) 
 
------------------------------------- 
State 'Loses Sense of Urgency on BEE' 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) National Empowerment Fund (NEF) Chairman Ronnie Ntuli 
lamented that the South African government seems to have lost its 
sense of urgency on Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) on a macro 
scale.  Ntuli's comments echoed those of Employment Equity 
Commission Chairman Jimmy Manyi, who said the employment equity law 
was failing to change the workplace significantly.  "While many 
development finance institutions are making concerted efforts to 
create the implementation tools needed for economic transformation, 
new energy is necessary at a macro level.  Strategies had to create 
black-owned enterprise, and include more black people in the 
economic mainstream." Manyi said.  Ntuli urged a shift away from a 
model which only bought in "small, tight-knit black groups into 
existing white-owned firms."  There was also a "massive need" for 
new black enterprises to be created and grown.  One possibility 
would be for the NEF to become more closely linked to the Department 
of Trade and Industry in terms of black empowerment across all 
industrial development sectors, and to more effectively identify 
trade opportunities for black empowered businesses.  (Business Day, 
September 18, 2008)

SAA Increases Service to Germany 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) South African Airways (SAA) announced that it would expand to 
daily flights between Johannesburg and Munich starting October 1. 
SAA decided to increase flights from four to seven flights a week to 
meet growing demand.  SAA also recently increased service from seven 
to ten flights per week between Johannesburg and Frankfurt. 
(Engineering News, September 18, 2008) 
 
------------------------------ 
Auto Industry Needs to Improve 
Global Competitiveness 
------------------------------ 
 
¶10. (U) Volkswagen South Africa (VWSA) welcomed the announcement of 
the structure and content of the new Automotive Production and 
Development Program (APDP), following "lengthy deliberation and many 
delays".  "The industry can now plan ahead through to 2020 with a 
much greater degree of certainty," said VWSA CEO David Powels. 
However, Powels asserted that the South African motor and component 
manufacturing industry has "a long road to travel" before it can 
claim global competitiveness.  In terms of cost competitiveness, he 
believed that there is an approximate 20% lag compared with 
manufacturers in Western Europe.  "This gap widens to between 30% 
and 40% when comparing South African manufacturing cost structures 
with those in emerging automotive power-houses such as India and 
China," warned Powels.  He advocated for increased investment in new 
technologies, increased manufacturing depth, and skill development 
Qtechnologies, increased manufacturing depth, and skill development 
"in order to grow the local content in vehicles manufactured in 
South Africa."  The automotive industry is strategically important 
to South Africa, contributing about 7% to gross domestic product and 
accounting for 16% of total exports.  (Engineering News, September 
19, 2008)

Major Development Projects in Cape Town 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶11. (U) Cape Town Mayor Helen Zille announced new developments 
amounting to about R30 billion ($3.8 billion) for the Cape Town 
central business district in the next three to five years. 
Two-thirds of the investments are from the private sector.  Zille 
said that the Cape metro region as a whole was expected to see 9.5% 
growth in fixed investment in the medium-term.  According to Zille, 
public investments included the R2.5 billion ($300 million) airport 
upgrade, R4 billion ($500 million) for the 2010 FIFA World Cup 
 
PRETORIA 00002071  004.2 OF 006 
 
 
stadium, R4.2 billion ($520 million) for the container harbor 
expansion at the port, R1.3 billion ($160 million) for the first 
phase of the bus-rapid-transit-system, and several billion rand for 
road and rail upgrades.  Private sector Developments include further 
expansion of the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, the Strand on 
Adderley development worth R2.5 billion ($310 million), the Media24 
head office expansion, the Chevron refinery expansion, and 
development of the Old Mutual's Malgas building.  The Malgas 
building will cost R137 million ($17 million) and, at 137 meters, 
will be among Africa's highest when finished.  (Business Day,

Decision on Nuclear Project in Progress 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶12. (U) The procurement and investment decision process for the 
proposed Nuclear-1 pressurized water reactor (PWR) nuclear power 
stations are underway, state-owned power utility Eskom said on 
September 16, noting no decision had yet been taken.  Eskom appealed 
to the media "and other interested parties" to allow space for the 
commercial process to unfold and be concluded.  Eskom General 
Manager Brian Statham said on September 17 that the utility will 
reach a decision within the week.  However, an Eskom spokesman said 
the company had not set a particular date for announcing a decision. 
 "The process is well under way, we can't state any particular date. 
 Our intention is to finalize the process by the end of the year," 
Fani Zulu said.  Eskom was evaluating bids for the proposed nuclear 
power stations from two suppliers of PWR technology: the EPR 
Consortium led by Areva of France and the N-Powerment Consortium led 
by Westinghouse of the U.S.  The EPR Consortium is offering two 
1,650 MW EPR units for a total station capacity of 3,300 MW, while 
N-Powerment is officering three 1,140 MW AP1000 units for a total 
station capacity of 3,420 MW.   Statham said Eskom had a number of 
potential locations for the power plants and the exact locations 
will depend on the type of plant chosen.  (Engineering News, 
September 16-17, 2008) 
 
------------------------------------ 
Eskom to Unveil First Cogen Projects 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶13. (U) State power utility Eskom is expected to unveil the first 
cogeneration projects, forming part of the Pilot National 
Cogeneration Project (PNCP), by the end of this month, but it is 
unclear whether these projects would meet the initial 900 MW target. 
 Speaking at the Cogeneration World Africa 2008 Conference in 
Johannesburg, on September 16, PNCP project leader Akash Prakash 
stressed the initiative was the forerunner to the larger, 
medium-term power purchase program (MTPPP), for which bids must be 
submitted by year-end.   Eskom had previously reported receiving 15 
cogeneration bids ahead of the PNCP's May 31 deadline.  Together 
with the MTPPP, Eskom hopes to facilitate the introduction of about 
3,000 MW of cogenerated power by 2012.  Eskom has been given the 
controversial mandate as the country's "single buyer" of power 
arising from industrial facilities and potential new independent 
power producers.  However, the National Energy Regulator of South 
Qpower producers.  However, the National Energy Regulator of South 
Africa (NERSA) has objected to the arrangement and has called for 
the creation of an agency, separate from Eskom, to purchase power 
arising from the power sector.  Eskom is still proceeding with both 
its PNCP and MTPPP and has let it be known that it is willing to 
contract at prices between 8-13 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour (kwh) 
for 2009-2013, with prices falling progressively from 2014 to an 
eventual level of 5 U.S. cents per kwh in 2018 (it is not clear that 
a future reduction in pricing will be financeable).  Industry and 
NERSA have criticized Eskom for not being receptive to practical and 
transparent arrangements for buying electricity from the private 
sector.  (Engineering News, September 16, 2008)

PPC Hopes to Expand Plant 
in Western Cape 
------------------------- 
 
¶14. (U) Cement Producer PPC has released the final 1,200-page 
environmental impact assessment (EIA) report for its planned R4 
billion ($500 million) expansion and upgrade of the aging Riebeeck 
cement factory in the Western Cape Province.  The new plant would 
have a capacity of around 1.3 million tons of cement per year, 
 
PRETORIA 00002071  005.2 OF 006 
 
 
according to PPC.  Should the Western Cape Environmental Affairs 
Department approve the project, construction would start in mid-2009 
and take three years to complete.  Approval of the EIA is not a 
foregone conclusion, because there may be local or NGO opposition. 
Moreover, new EIA legislation is still under review by government. 
The new cement plant would be considerably more efficient than the 
existing plant, which produces 550,000 tons per year.  The new plant 
would use less water, energy, and 30% less coal per ton of cement 
produced.  PPC said bag filters would control dust emissions from 
the kilns stacks, limiting dust concentration in the cleaned gas to 
below the level of 50 milligrams per cubic meter, satisfying 
international and South African standards.  Chief Operating Officer 
Orrie Fenn said the new plant was aimed at meeting the growing 
demand for cement in the Western Cape.  South Africa's cement demand 
has grown by nearly 60% over the past five years and coupled with 
government's focus on infrastructure development, the Western Cape 
could face a shortage of cement in the next five years if production 
capacity is not increased, he said.  (Engineering News, September 
15, 2008)

SA Lays Out Its Hydrogen Economy 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶15. (U) The Department of Science and Technology (DST) revealed 
earlier that it had selected hydrogen and fuel cell technologies as 
key research themes under its frontier science and technology 
program.  With South Africa possessing about 80% of the world's 
known platinum-group metal (PGM) reserves, and PGMs having 
applicability for fuel cells, the government felt there was a 
natural synergy.  DST Minister Mosibudi Mangena argued that the link 
between PGMs and new energy alternatives had the potential to raise 
South Africa's strategic importance in the global economy.  He made 
the remarks during the launch of the hydrogen and fuel technologies 
research, development, and innovation strategy, which was approved 
by the Cabinet last May.  The strategy also proposes to build on 
existing knowledge of high-temperature, gas-cooled nuclear reactors 
and coal gasification and liquefaction technology to develop new 
cost-competitive hydrogen-generation solutions.  Three centers of 
competence would be established to drive the various elements of the 
strategy.  The Center of Competence for Catalyst would be jointly 
hosted by state-owned minerals research entity Mintek and the 
University of Cape Town.  The University of the Western Cape would 
host the Center for Systems Integration and Validation, while the 
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the 
University of the North West would jointly host the Hydrogen 
Infrastructure Center of Competence (currently engaged in Pebble Bed 
Modular Reactor (PBMR) - related research).  (Engineering News,

Cisco Builds ICT Innovation Center 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶16. (U) Cisco announced a R215 million ($27 million) investment to 
create an ICT innovation hub center in Gauteng Province.  The Cisco 
Innovation Hub Technology Center (CIHTC) aims to develop skills, 
QInnovation Hub Technology Center (CIHTC) aims to develop skills, 
intellectual property, entrepreneurship, and solution development 
capabilities in the local ICT sector.  These initiatives are 
expected to drive a R1 billion ($125 million) gross domestic product 
increase over an initial five-year period.  Cisco South Africa MD 
Steve Midgley said the company was making this investment to ensure 
that South Africa had enough skills, solution creation capabilities, 
and intellectual property to benefit from broadband when the 
"revolution really kicks off".  "South Africa is on the brink of 
entering a broadband boom," he noted.  According to Midgley, this 
will change the way people live and work and should create an 
enabling platform from which new business models can be developed. 
The CIHTC is expected to create at least 200 direct and 800 indirect 
employment opportunities.  Initiatives at the CIHTC will include a 
Global Talent Acquisition Program (GTAP), the Cisco Netversity, 
Entrepreneur Institute, and a software development program.  The 
CITHC focuses on developing technology solutions to solve common 
business challenges in South Africa such as improving education and 
crime prevention strategies.  GTAP aims to tackle the growing 
shortage of skilled networking professionals and has already 
absorbed the first group of students to create high-level network 
entrepreneurs at the Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert (CCIE) 
level.  Cisco aspires to train at least 120 CCIE-level network 
 
PRETORIA 00002071  006.2 OF 006 
 
 
engineers over a five-year period for the local market, at its own 
cost.  Netversity aims to develop 150 network design engineers 
through an experiential architecture and design program.  The 
company also hopes to train 250 entrepreneurs through its 
Entrepreneur Institute.  (Engineering News, September 15, 2008)
