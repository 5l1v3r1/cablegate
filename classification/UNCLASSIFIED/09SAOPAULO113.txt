Title- A prudent Optimism 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (2-26) says: "....The 
economy will return to work again reasonably when the reshaping of 
the financial system generates results.  This will depend not only 
on more severe market regulations but also, and primarily, on the 
recapitalization of major banks....The  set [of measures proposed by 
Barack Obama's administration], as we know, is much more than a 
bunch of projects merely juxtaposed in a multibillionaire package. 
It is a good start." 
 
Title- Uribe and the Third mandate 
 
Editorial in liberal A Folha de S. Paulo (2-26) states: "The signs, 
now more frequent, that Colombia's President Alvaro Uribe intends to 
hurl himself into the adventure of a third mandate are 
worrisome....One of the most popular presidents of South America, 
alongside Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, would give an important example 
to the region....if he would exorcise himself of the temptation to 
continue."
