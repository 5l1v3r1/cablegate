REF: A) BIS e-mail request dated May 6, 2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) attempted 
to conduct a post shipment verification (PSV) at Altus Automation 
Industry (HK), Unit 1001, Four Seas building, 208-212 Nathan Road, 
Hong Kong (Altus). The items in question for this PSV are various 
mass flow equipment products exported to Altus on or about March 11, 
¶2008.  On the applicable shippers export declaration (SED), these 
items are not classified meaning that they are likely EAR99 and 
eligible for shipment to virtually all destinations and 
end-uses/users worldwide.  The exporter was Micro Motion, Inc. of 
Boulder Colorado. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Altus has been in 
existence since 2006.  The company's paid up share capital is the 
Hong Kong equivalent of USD 13. The Hong Kong Companies Registry 
lists Ouyang, Jifeng (with mainland China passport number G08871766) 
as director.  Ouyang, Jifeng is not listed as a director in any 
other Hong Kong company. 
 
¶4.  ECO was unable to find a web presence for Altus Automation 
Industry (HK).  A range of other companies appear to be located at 
the company's address, which is also the address of ATA Corporate 
Formation and Management Limited (a company secretarial service). 
 
¶5.  Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan attempted for some time to 
arrange a meeting with the company.  Calls to the company were 
answered by ATA Corporate Formation and Management Limited who 
agreed to forward the message to Altus.  Despite numerous calls and 
a certified letter requesting a meeting, Altus did not respond. 
 
¶6.  Based on the information noted above, ECO believes that Altus 
most likely does not have any permanent Hong Kong presence.  While 
there is no apparent export control violation associated with this 
shipment, ECO nonetheless does not believe Altus to be a suitable 
recipient of controlled U.S. origin technology.
