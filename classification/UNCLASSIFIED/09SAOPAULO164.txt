"Dollar's privilege" 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (3-23) states:  "The 
devaluation of the U.S. dollar accentuated in the world last week, 
led some analysts to wonder that the U.S. currency might suffer a 
speculative attack.....Nevertheless, there are elements to believe 
that the U.S. economy remains protected, at least to this kind of 
discredited manifestation." 
 
"Do as I say" 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (3-23) by former Brazil's 
Environment Minister Marina Silva says: "In his meeting with 
President Barack Obama, President Lula asked to the U.S. president 
for a fast adhesion to the Biodiversity Convention, renegade by 
George Bush.  The request comes in timely, as in 2010 the payment 
system for biodiversity use, which will generate resources for 
preservation in mega diverse countries like Brazil, comes into 
force. The problem is that most of the times, we [Brazil] have a 
correct and bold external stance but domestically we don't do the 
homework well. Brazil ratified the Convention in 1994 and so far we 
do not have a law to regulate the access to genetic resources."
