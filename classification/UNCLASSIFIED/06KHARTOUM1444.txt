Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  On June 18, 2006, the U.N. Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) convened the forth Technical Task 
Force meeting on avian influenza (AI) in Khartoum. 
Following three weeks of no new reported cases, samples 
received from two different locations in Khartoum State 
tested positive for the H5N2 virus.  The Sudanese 
government has banned the importation of poultry and 
poultry products.  The committee formed to plan for the 
upcoming AI vaccination program continues preparations. 
The joint proposal of FAO, the U.N. Children's Fund 
(UNICEF), and the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO) on 
actions needed to mitigate and contain the AI outbreak in 
Sudan has not yet been presented to donors.  Two thousand 
units of USAID-donated personal protective equipment 
(PPE) have arrived in country.  End summary.

Outbreak Update and Vaccination Preparations 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On June 18, FAO/Khartoum convened a meeting of the 
Technical Task Force on AI.  Following three weeks of no 
new cases reported, samples received from two different 
locations in Khartoum State tested positive for the H5N2 
virus on June 8.  No positive cases were reported from 
other states.  Currently, 216 farms in Sudan are affected 
by AI.  The Task Force stressed the need for all 
stakeholders to remain alert, as a decline in the number 
of outbreaks does not mean that the vQus has been 
eliminated. 
 
¶3.  The Task Force reported that the importation of 
poultry and poultry products into Sudan has been banned 
indefinitely by the government.  The committee formed to 
address issues related to the economic impact of AI on 
the poultry industry in Sudan, including compensation for 
the farmers, expects to submit a report by end of July 
¶2006. 
 
¶4.  In collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Animal 
Resources and Fisheries and the Federal Veterinary 
Laboratory, the Khartoum State Ministry of Agriculture is 
making preparations for a poultry vaccinationprogram.

$oposal on actions 
needed to mitigate and contain AI has yet to be 
officially presented to donors, but unofficial reports 
put the figure at approximately USD 7.5 million.  FAO has 
allocated USD 250,000 for AI control activities.  USAID 
has awarded USD 200,000 and provided a total of 2,000 
units of PPE to FAO, 1,500 of which have arrived at 
Khartoum Airport and will be distributed in consultation 
with FAO.  FAO is looking for other donors to contribute 
and expects that money may be made available from the 
Common Humanitarian Fund. 
 
¶7.  FAO will hold workshop on AI control in Beirut, 
Lebanon, during the last week of June, and candidates 
from Sudan will participate.  The Ministry of Health has 
also sent staff to Turkey to learn from the Turkish AI 
experience.  The Nairobi workshop originally scheduled 
 
KHARTOUM 00001444  002 OF 002 
 
 
for June 12 has been postponed until July.

Southern Sudan - Preparedness 
----------------------------- 
 
¶8.  The Government of Southern Sudan Ministry of Animal 
Resources has established an AI task force that meets 
regularly in Juba.  No AI cases have been reported in the 
south, which lacks a poultry industry.  Concern is 
warranted, however, for the health of backyard flocks and 
wild birds.  Of the 2,000 PPE USAID provided to FAO, 500 
were shipped directly to Southern Sudan.  FAO continues 
working to secure a place for one candidate from the 
south to participate in the Nairobi workshop in July.
