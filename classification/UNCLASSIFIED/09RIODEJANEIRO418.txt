Rio-based center-left daily Jornal do Brasil writes: "President 
Barack Obama's decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to the 
war in Afghanistan is still echoing. There are those who criticize 
this militaristic option, cautioning that many weapons do not 
necessarily bring about a long-lasting peace (...)The discussion 
relating to Afghanistan, at least recently, is relatively 
superficial. And it needs to be deepened to include a historical 
perspective (...) Shortly after his inauguration, Barack Obama 
announced with pomp and circumstance an investment of USD 200 
million in schools to be built with American help along the porous 
and hostile frontier with Pakistan, a region where feelings of 
goodwill toward fundamentalist Taliban thrive and [a region] 
responsible for the training of important cells in Osama Bin 
Laden's Al Qaeda network. Looking at this argument from a distance, 
one may believe that it is a good and well-intended measure(...)The 
difficulty seems to be the very essence of the U.N.'s role (...) 
Since the fall of the Taliban in 2003, there is an insistence on 
solidifying the model of participatory democracy [in the country] 
with a parliament, something that is difficult to do in a country 
with such deeply-rooted tribal divisions. Those who live in Kabul 
may have even started to believe that voting in the Loya Jyrga (the 
assembly) is the best way to build a future. But the man that leads 
his goats through the mountains like his father and all his 
ancestors has a different view of the world. The West needs to 
understand it too if it wants there to be some permanent peace in 
the region."  (Sunday, Dec 6, page A8)
