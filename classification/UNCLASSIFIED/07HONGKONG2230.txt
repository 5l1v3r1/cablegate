1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification (PSV) at MTech Imaging Pte 
Ltd., Block 221 Henderson Road No. 04-09, Henderson Building, 
Singapore  (MTech).  The item in question is a thermal-eye 3640RS 
uncooled thermal imager exported on or about July 18, 2006 and 
valued at USD 3,950.  The item is classified under Export Control 
Classification Number (ECCN) 6A003 and controlled for national 
security (NS) and regional stability (RS) reasons. The exporter was 
L3 Communications Infrared Products (L-3) of Dallas Texas. 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore companies registry, MTech has been in 
existence since 2004.  Its paid-up share capital is the Singapore 
equivalent of USD 850,000.  Singapore nationals, Baljit Singh and 
Yong Foo Hoong are listed as directors.  Shareholders include 
Miltrade Technologies Pte. Ltd., Sarjit Singh Deo, an Australian 
national with a Fairfax Virginia address and Singaporean national 
Han Mui Neo.  ECO and BIS Assistant Director for Operations, John 
Sonderman, met with Mr. Singh at Miltrade (Singh is that company's 
CEO) in January of 2007 as part of a BIS Sentinel trip.  That visit 
resulted in a favorable PSV at Miltrade. 
 
¶4.  On June 20, 2007, the ECO visited the company and met with Mr. 
Benny Tan, General Manager.  Mr. Tan stated that MTech is active in 
the thermal imaging market. Its customers include both industrial 
customers in the oil and gas sector while other customers come from 
the safety and security and military sectors.  Applications in the 
industrial sector include temperature testing and defect diagnosis. 
MTech also produces cameras for remotely measuring body temperature 
(for application at airports and similar locations).  More 
information on the company is available at its web sit, 
www.Mtech-imaging.com. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Tan showed the ECO the applicable item (with serial number 
6201800152-E737).  ECO notes that the product number on the item 
shown to him was 70700360-1.  That number is different than the 
product number stated in the L-3 commercial invoice provided to the 
ECO by OEA.  ECO recommends that OEA contact L-3 concerning this 
apparent discrepancy.  Mr. Tan stated that this item will be used in 
the design and development of additional body temperature testing 
devices as well as target sighting devices.  Mr. Tan was familiar 
with the Export Administration Regulations and on the restrictions 
contained in D356969.  ECO provided Mr. Tan with additional 
information concerning the Commerce Control List, United States 
Munitions List and rules governing the applicability of U.S. 
controls to items containing de minimis U.S. origin content. 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, MTech appeared to be a suitable recipient 
of the commodities shipped since MTech cooperated with the PSV, 
provided ECO with access to the item and operates a line of business 
consistent with the item's use.  The ECO recommends that this PSV be 
classified as Favorable.
