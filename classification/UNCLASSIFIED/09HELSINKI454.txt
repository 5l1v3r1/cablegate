(U) Pol/Econoff delivered reftel remarks to Heidi 
Martila, desk officer for Burma, Indonesia, 
Philippines, ASEAN and Timor Leste at the Ministry for 
Foreign Affairs.  Martila stated that GOF policy 
follows the guidelines of an internal E.U. paper on 
Burma and that this paper is "very in line with U.S. 
policy."  Finland adheres to a policy of dialogue in 
addition to sanctions and is attempting to pass this 
information to Aung San Suu Kyi in its next meeting 
with her.  Additionally, the GOF has a policy of 
actively engaging any Asian partners who might have 
influence with the Burmese authorities.
