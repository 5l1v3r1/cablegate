President Obama Wins Nobel Peace Prize 
CNN Turk and all other channels were fast in announcing that US 
President Obama has won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize. He wins over 
more than 200 nominees. Most coverage was straightforward.  At 
mainstream NTV, the morning anchor hosted a call in program, 
commenting that the win was unusual because "Obama has not made all 
his campaign pledges and that he's sped up the war in Afghanistan." 
Soli Ozel, a respected columnist for Haber Turk newspaper, commented 
that "I'm extremely surprised because the Afghanistan/Iraq war has 
been the US weak point and so far we've only heard expressions of 
intentions... the Nobel Peace Prize should not be given to 
intentions." Ozel continued:  "I truly believe that Obama wants 
peace but we don't have anything concrete yet.   He's made a change 
in discourse regarding US policies around the world but that 
shouldn't be enough for the Nobel Prize." 
 
Secretary Clinton to Attend Turkey-Armenia Reconciliation Signing 
Ceremony in Zurich, October 10 
All papers report that Secretary Clinton will attend the signing in 
Zurich at the start of her European tour.  Mainstream Hurriyet gives 
details of the unusual "unofficial" invite by the Swiss.  Mainstream 
Hurriyet claims that because the Swiss were concerned about riling 
the Armenia Diaspora, they released an invitation by email just to 
the Turkish press corps and suggested they get there in time for the 
signing at the Zurich University Paleontology Institute.  Turkey's 
new ambassador to Switzerland Oguz Demiralp will attend as part of 
the Turkish delegation. Leftist Taraf claims Armenia insisted on 
signing the protocols in the presence of witnesses from the EU and 
the Council of Europe.  Media also report FM Davutoglu yesterday 
stressed that the protocols recognize the current borders.  Papers 
also report Armenian PM Tigran Sarkisian as saying they recognize 
the existing borders with Turkey.  Hurriyet says PM Sarksian was 
also quoted as saying that property claims will be considered after 
the signing.  On Thursday, Davutoglu was widely quoted that he 
expected "no surprises" regarding the signing. 
 
"Not Only About Armenia:" Deniz Ulke Aribogan thinks Turkey-Armenia 
normalization will better serve Azerbaijan's interests.  In 
mainstream Aksam, she writes: "Turkey-Armenia normalization process 
has more geopolitical importance than improvement of bilateral ties. 
 Turkey not only opens itself up to Armenia but also expands 
influence toward the Caspian Sea.  At the same time Turkey helps 
Azerbaijan to open toward the Black Sea.  At the end of the day, 
this process will provide win-win opportunities for everybody in the 
region." 
 
In an article "Armenian Diaspora Sins Again" columnist Mehmet Ali 
Birand believes Turkish-Armenian process will continue despite all 
counter efforts by the Diaspora.  In mainstream Posta, he writes: 
"The Foreign Ministers of Armenia and Turkey will sign a protocol to 
reorganize relations. This protocol includes a process of mutual 
understanding, a peaceful attitude, a new research method for 
genocide allegations, the opening of borders between the two 
countries and other issues.The upcoming visit of Armenian President 
to Turkey for watching the national football game between Turkey and 
Armenia with the Turkish President is going to be a signal of a 
brand new start. This is the possibility that makes the Armenian 
Diaspora revolt. Sarksian visiting Turkey and thus starting the 
protocol process does not fit the Diaspora's general politics. The 
Diaspora is afraid of losing enforcement power over Turkey. 
President Gul's appeal to the Armenian Diaspora in this respect is 
very appropriate. Sarksian coming to Turkey is crucial. In times in 
which the Turkish public for the first time started to relax and the 
idea of living with Armenia sounds right, the Diaspora's efforts 
will backfire just like the Asala operation."

Minsk Group Meeting in Moldova 
Papers report the Armenian and Azerbaijani Presidents met Thursday 
in Kishinev, Moldova for 3.5 hours.  Papers report Ambassador 
Bradtke said the meeting was "very positive, serious and 
constructive."  Islamist-oriented Zaman reports talks will continue 
today with the participation of Russian President Medvedev. 
 
President Gul in France 
Papers are quoting Gul's comments to French PM Fillon as "don't 
prevent Turkey's EU membership" and "a privileged partnership is not 
wanted." Le Monde, according to Milliyet, commented that Gul's 
official dinner last night to kick off the Turkey celebration in 
France was a very low profile affair -- no French minister attended. 
 
 
CHP Leader Baykal Receives the Long Expected Letter from PM Erdogan 
Today's papers and TV channels comment on the letter CHP leader 
Baykal received from PM Erdogan.  Mainstream Milliyet says that 
Baykal did not find the letter satisfactory and said that it was 
only a request for an appointment to discuss democratic opening 
issue.  Islamist-oriented/intellectual Zaman, in turn says that 
Erdogan said in his letter that terrorism problem could not be 
resolved only by means of armed fight.  Social consensus and support 
from political parties were needed in this process. 
 
Greek "Foreign Minister" to Istanbul 
Vast coverage of Papandreou's visit to Istanbul for SE Europe 
Foreign Ministers Conference.  Papandreou, who is dual-hatted as PM 
and FM, will attend in his FM capacity.  In Istanbul, Papandreou 
will visit the Patriarch.  His first "PM" official visit will be to 
Cyprus on October 19. 
 
U/S Tauscher: Turkey may become part of the new missile shield 
program 
Papers report Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms 
control and international security, said "PAC-3 Missiles that Turkey 
will buy might become part of the new missile shield program..." 
Tauscher invited "all NATO allies, including Turkey," to join the 
project.  She said the new system would result in more protection 
for countries like Turkey.  Meanwhile, mainstream Sabah notes 
Russian Foreign Ministry announced Secretary Clinton will go next 
week to Moscow to discuss Missile Shield issues.
