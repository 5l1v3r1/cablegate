Â¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel points on reform of the UN 
internal administration of justice on March 15 to Department 
of Foreign Affairs Director for International Cooperation 
Henk van der Westhuizen.  Van der Westhuizen thanked PolOff 
March 19 for the information on the U.S. views.  He said that 
South Africa generally supports the Redesign Panel's 
recommendations, but understands that the hard work of 
negotiations in the Fifth Committee is still to come.  South 
Africa will study closely the report of the Sixth Committee, 
as well as the ACABQ report, before making any decisions on 
specific proposals.  As with most Fifth Committee matters, 
Pretoria will work with the G-77 to form a joint position to 
lead to "meaningful reform" of the system.
