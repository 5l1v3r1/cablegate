Reftel had asked Post to report the status of Ireland's 
disbursements to Iraqi reconstruction.  According to the 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), the GOI donated euro 5 
million in 2003 to meet immediate humanitarian needs in Iraq 
following the commencement of U.S. military action.  In 
addition, the GOI pledged euro 3 million at the 2003 Madrid 
conference.  Of that pledge, euro 1.5 million has been 
disbursed: euro 1 million to the UNICEF primary education 
program in 2004, and euro 500,000 (in two installments, one 
in 2004 and one in 2005) to the Marsh Arabs.  According to 
the DFA, security concerns in Iraq have made it difficult to 
identify reconstruction projects to which the remaining euro 
1.5 million could allocated.  SeparQely, the GOI made a euro 
500,000 contribution to the UN protection force in December 
Â¶2004.
