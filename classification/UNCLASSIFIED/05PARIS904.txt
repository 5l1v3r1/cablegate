"THE RETURN OF THE SHIITES." FOR JEAN-PIERRE PERRIN IN 
LIBERATION "THE KURDS ARE THE GREAT WINNERS OF THESE

IN A FULL-PAGE INTERVIEW IN POPULAR RIGHT-OF-CENTER FRANCE 
SOIR, ANTOINE SFEIR, EDITOR OF "LES CAHIERS DE L'ORIENT,"

THAT "SISTANI HAS NEVER PROMOTED AN ISLAMIC STATE." 
 
THE MUNICH SUMMIT, SCHROEDER'S PROPOSAL FOR A "HIGH-LEVEL 
GROUP" TO REFLECT ON THE FUTURE OF NATO, AND U.S.-EU 
POSITIONS, ESPECIALLY ON IRAN ARE DEBATED IN A FULL-PAGE 
REPORT IN LE FIGARO BY CORRESPONDENT PIERRE BOCEV WHO ENTITLES 
HIS REPORT: "TRANSATLANTIC MISUNDERSTANDINGS." HE ALSO QUOTES

FOR TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS." (SEE PART C) 
 
BERNARD GUETTA IN HIS RADIO COMMENTARY TITLED "SCHROEDER'S

AND CONDOLEEZZA RICE'S RECENT SPEECHES INDICATE A CHANGE IN 
POLICY OR JUST A CHANGE IN TONE. (SEE PART C)

TRIAL OPENING TOMORROW IN CALIFORNIA. A TWO-PAGE REPORT

(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
IRAQ - ELECTION RESULTS 
 
"WASHINGTON WILL NOT TOLERATE A THEOCRACY" 
PHILIPPE GELIE IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (02/14): "AFTER 
THE POSITIVE IMAGES OF IRAQIS STANDING ON LINE TO VOTE AND THE 
MARCH FOR DEMOCRACY, NOW COMES THE TIME FOR DIFFICULTIES. THE 
BATTLE FOR POWER PROMISES TO BE BITTER, NOT NECESSARILY 
TRANSPARENT AND THE TYPE OF REGIME THAT WILL COME OUT IS NOT 
AT ALL GUARANTEED. NO SINGLE LEADER STANDS OUT AMIDST THE 
HETEROGENEOUS COALITION. THE BATTLE FOR PRIME MINISTER IS ON. 
FOR WASHINGTON, THE FIRST CONSEQUENCE OF THE ELECTIONS IS THAT 
THE ALAWI ERA IS COMING TO AN END. BUT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION 
SAYS IT IS READY TO TAKE THE RISK OF LOSING ITS GRIP ON THE 
PROCESS, CLAIMING IT IS ALSO READY TO WITHDRAW ITS TROOPS IF 
ASKED." 
 
"DANGERS" 
GERARD DUPUY IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (02/14): "THE FUTURE 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WILL NOT BE FULLY REPRESENTATIVE OF IRAQ 
BECAUSE OF THE MASSIVE BOYCOTT BY THE SUNNIS. ALSO ONE CANNOT 
DISREGARD THE FACT THAT THE AYATOLLAHS' INTENTIONS ARE 
UNCLEAR, BEGINNING WITH SISTANI'S. THE RESULTS WILL STRENGTHEN 
THE KURDS. THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO DANGERS OF CIVIL WAR, 
TRIGGERED BY THE KURDS OR BY THE RELIGIOUS SHIITES. BUT 
EXACTLY BECAUSE THESE TWO GROUPS ARE BEGINNING TO SEE THEY NOW 
HAVE MUCH TO LOSE, WE CAN EXPECT THEY WILL AVOID ENGAGING IN 
THIS SORT OF POLITICAL ADVENTURE. THE BEST WAY TO CONSERVE 
POWER IS, AFTER ALL, TO BEGIN BY SHARING IT." 
 
MUNICH SUMMIT - NATO - IRAN 
"TRANSATLANTIC MISUNDERSTANDINGS IN MUNICH" 
PIERRE BOCEV IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (02/14): "MUNICH 
WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE REMEMBERED AS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY. 
PRESIDENT BUSH, WHEN HE COMES TO EUROPE NEXT WEEK, WILL 
PROBABLY NOT BE CONVINCED BY THE IDEA OF A `GROUP OF HIGH 
LEVEL FIGURES' TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF NATO. EVEN IF 
RUMSFELD HIMSELF SIGNIFIED A CHANGE OF ATTITUDE, WHEN HE SPOKE 
OF `THE OLD RUMSFELD.' BUT WHILE THE TONE HAS CHANGED, THE 
MUSIC SCORE REMAINS THE SAME. IF NECESSARY WASHINGTON WILL ACT 
WITHOUT NATO AND WITH VOLUNTEERS, AS IT DID IN IRAQ." 
 
"SCHROEDER'S RESPONSE TO BUSH" 
BERNARD GUETTA ON GOVERNMENT-RUN FRANCE INTER RADIO (02/14): 
"THERE IS A GROWING DEBATE IN EUROPE ABOUT WHETHER U.S. 
DIPLOMACY HAS CHANGED OR REMAINS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. IN 
MUNICH ON SATURDAY SCHROEDER'S SPEECH PARTOOK OF THAT DEBATE. 
ON EITHER SIDE OF THE DEBATE THERE ARE VALID ARGUMENTS, 
BECAUSE IN POLITICS, WHEN THERE IS A CHANGE IN FORM IT MEANS 
THERE IS A CHANGE IN CONTENT. ONE THING IS CERTAIN: PRESIDENT 
BUSH HAS NOT ADOPTED MULTILATERALISM AND HE IS NOT READY TO 
SUBMIT AMERICA'S POWER TO THE UNSC'S DECISIONS. AMERICA IS 
STILL `THE ESSENTIAL NATION' OF MADELEINE ALBRIGHT'S DAYS. ON 
THIS FUNDAMENTAL POINT, CONTINUITY IN WASHINGTON PREVAILS. WHY 
THEN ARE BUSH, RICE AND NOW RUMSFELD TRYING SO HARD TO SOFTEN 
THE EUROPEANS? . PRESIDENT BUSH HAS WON A WAR (IN IRAQ) AND 
WHEN HE HAS RUMSFELD SAY IN MUNICH THAT `A NATION CANNOT FIGHT 
EXTREMISM ALONE,' WHEN SECRETARY RICE EXPLAINS THAT `LIBERTY 
CANNOT BE IMPOSED' AND THAT `TODAY'S AGENDA REQUIRES A GLOBAL 
PARTNERSHIP' WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THEM BECAUSE 
AMERICA IS INDEED VERY MUCH ALONE. SO, WHETHER IT IS CHANGE OR 
CONTINUITY, AMERICA NEEDS EUROPE. AND EUROPE HAS UNDERSTOOD 
THAT THIS IS A MAJOR AND DECISIVE CHANGE. SCHROEDER 
IMMEDIATELY COUNTERED BUSH'S OFFER FOR A `PARTNERSHIP' WITH A 
REQUEST FOR A DIPLOMATIC AGREEMENT WITH IRAN AND FOR THE 
ALLIANCE TO BECOME `A VENUE FOR DISCUSSION AND COORDINATION.' 
WE MUST TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE UP ON ITS WORDS AND IMPOSE OUR 
CONDITIONS." 
 
TOGO 
 
"PARIS BARELY CONDEMNS." 
YVES THREARD IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (02/14): "WHAT TO DO 
WITH TOGO? EVERY TIME SOMETHING GOES WRONG IN WEST AFRICA, 
EVERYONE IS AFRAID THE REGION WILL BE SET ON FIRE. BUT TOGO IS 
NOT THE IVORY COAST. THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT SEEMS EASIER TO 
BRING BACK TO REASON. AND REASON MEANS ORGANIZING DEMOCRATIC 
ELECTIONS. FRANCE HAS THE MEANS TO WEIGH IN ENOUGH TO DEMAND 
THE WITHDRAWAL OF EYADEMA'S SON. EVERY INTERNATIONAL 
INSTITUTION, THE EU AND THE U.S. HAVE CONDEMNED THE COUP. THE 
WORD COUP WAS NOT UTTERED BY PARIS, WHICH PREFERRED TO TALK 
ABOUT `PUTTING AN END TO THE TRANSITION.' CHIRAC RECENTLY SAID 
THAT FRANCE COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO BE `AFRICA'S SHERIFF.' 
GRANTED. BUT ONE COULD EXPECT IT TO BE THE BEST FRIEND OF THE 
RIGHT OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY. WITHOUT EXCEPTION." LEACH
