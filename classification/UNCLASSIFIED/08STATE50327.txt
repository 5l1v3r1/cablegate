SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - LEBANON 
 
¶1.  This Travel Warning updates information on security 
threats and ongoing political violence in Lebanon, and 
informs U.S. citizens of current safety and security 
concerns. The Department of State urges that Americans 
avoid all travel to Lebanon and that American citizens in 
Lebanon consider carefully the risks of remaining. This 
supersedes the Travel Warning for Lebanon issued on April 
21, 2008. 
¶2.  Violence broke out on May 7, 2008 in the capital, 
Beirut, when Hizballah militants blocked the road leading 
to Rafiq Hariri International Airport.  As of May 12, 
2008, the airport remains inaccessible. 
¶3.  There have been reports that Hizballah fighters 
continue to push into areas of Lebanon where they have not 
traditionally been prevalent.  In addition to the violence 
provoked by these incursions, the U.S. remains concerned 
about the threat of terrorist attacks against Western 
interests in Lebanon. Groups such as Al-Qaeda and Jund al- 
Sham are present in the country and have issued statements 
calling for attacks against Western interests in the 
past. 
¶4.  The U.S. Embassy has suspended non-immigrant visa 
services as of Monday, May 12, 2008.  Normal visa services 
are expected to resume when conditions improve. The 
Embassy continues to provide emergency and routine 
American citizens services. 
¶5.  Currently the American Embassy advises American 
citizens present in Lebanon to ensure they have an 
adequate supply of food, water and other essential items 
and to remain safely inside their homes.  Americans are 
encouraged to review their travel plans following 
resumption of normal air services. 
¶6.  Current options for exit from Lebanon include: 
 
Exit by land to Syria. - Overland routes to Syrian border 
crossings are open intermittently.  Those traveling by 
land to Syria technically need a Syrian visa issued in 
Washington.  Syrian officials have been issuing visas to 
Americans at the border; however, Americans have reported 
that they have had to wait for between five and eight 
hours in order to be cleared for departure. 
Exit by sea to Cyprus.  - There are currently no ferry 
services to Cyprus.  The only sea route available has been 
via private boat rental.  The cost of a private yacht for 
passage to Cyprus is expensive.  Americans seriously 
interested in this option should identify like-minded 
people and pool their resources. 
 
¶7.  Landmines and unexploded ordnance continually pose 
significant dangers throughout southern Lebanon, 
particularly south of the Litani River, as well as in 
areas of the country where civil war fighting was 
intense. More than a dozen civilians have been killed and 
over 100 injured by unexploded ordnance following the 
armed conflict in July-August 2006. Travelers should watch 
for posted landmine warnings and strictly avoid all areas 
where landmines and unexploded ordnance may be present. 
¶8.  U.S. citizens traveling to Lebanon or resident in 
Lebanon should be aware that the U.S. Embassy has limited 
ability to reach all areas of Lebanon. The Embassy cannot 
guarantee that Embassy employees can render assistance to 
U.S. citizens in areas where there is limited government 
control. 
¶9.  United States citizens are responsible for arranging 
commercial or private means of transportation to depart 
Lebanon. For Americans, individual or small-group travel 
out of the country remains the safest option.   U.S. 
Government-facilitated evacuations such as took place in 
2006 occur only when no safe private alternatives exist. 
Evacuation would be provided on a cost-recovery basis, 
which means the traveler must reimburse the U.S. 
 
STATE 00050327  002 OF 002 
 
 
government for the cost of the travel. The lack of valid 
travel documents (U.S. passport or U.S. visa, as 
appropriate) will slow the U.S. embassy's ability to 
provide assistance. Further information on the 
department's role during emergencies is provided at 
http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/tips/emerg encies/emerge 
ncies_1212.html. 
¶10.  The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. 
government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to 
require them to live and work under strict security 
restrictions. These practices limit, and may occasionally 
prevent, access by U.S. Embassy officials to certain areas 
of the country. Unofficial travel to Lebanon by U.S. 
government employees and their family members requires 
prior approval by the Department of State. 
¶11.  The Embassy is located in Awkar, near Antelias, 
Beirut, Lebanon. Public access hours for American citizens 
are Monday through Thursday, 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.; 
however, American citizens who require emergency services 
outside of these hours may contact the embassy by 
telephone at any time.  The telephone numbers are (961-4) 
542-600, 543-600, and fax 544-209. American citizens may 
register with the embassy online by 
visiting https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs. 
Information on consular services and registration can also 
be found at http://lebanon.usembassy.gov or by phone at 
the above telephone numbers between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 
p.m., Monday through Friday local time. 
¶12.  Updated information on travel and security in Lebanon 
may be obtained from the Department of State by calling 1- 
888-407-4747 within the United States and Canada or, from 
overseas, 1-202-501-4444. Additional details can be found 
in the Department of State's Country Specific Information 
for Lebanon, and the Worldwide Caution, which are 
available on the Department's Internet website at 
http://travel.state.gov. 
 
¶13.  Minimize considered.
