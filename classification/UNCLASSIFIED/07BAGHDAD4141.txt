SUBJECT: STAFFDEL GARVEY MEETS WITH DEFMIN ABDUL QADR 
 
¶1. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Professional 
Staff Member Patrick Garvey met with Iraqi Defense Minister 
Abdul Qadr Muhammed Jasim December 7 to discuss the current 
state of Iraqi defense forces and development efforts in 
the MOD.  While noting the significant progress that the 
Iraqi military has made over the last two years, Abdul Qadr 
admitted that Coalition Forces' assistance would be needed 
for at least another year before Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) 
were prepared to take complete responsibility for security 
in Iraq. 
 
¶2. In response to Mr. Garvey's questions on the status 
of the ISF, DefMin Abdul Qadr said that the Ministry of 
Interior had not established a proper command 
and control for what is in effect an Army.  These problems 
are being resolved now, but three years has been wasted, 
allowing political parties and factionalsim to impede the 
MOI.  Abdul Qadr said the biggest fight for the MOD, and 
other ministries as well, was against corruption.  It sapped 
the strength of the ISF and undermined popular confidence 
in the ISF.  Abdul Qadr noted that MOD must sometimes act 
against criminal actors even though it has no arrest 
authority.  He insisted the armed forces coordinate with 
the Ministry of Interior for subsequent criminal 
investigations and with the Ministry of Justice for 
detention or eventual incarceration. 
 
¶3. Mr. Garvey noted that Senator Lugar supported MOD's 
efforts to acquire equipment from the United States to better 
secure Iraq's border.  He applauded the MOD's efforts in this 
area.  He encouraged MOD to take full advantage of U.S. 
training opportunities, including training the trainers for Iraqi 
training academies.  Abdul Qadr responded that the Iraqi armed 
forces have personnel being trained in the United States 
and many other countries.  He closed the brief meeting by 
noting that, with Coalition and NATO Training Mission-Iraq 
assistance,  Iraq's own academies were making serious 
progress in training officers and NCOs, though the air 
force lags behind the army in this regard. 
 
¶4. Mr. Garvey did not have an opportunity to review 
this message before departing post.
