SUBJECT: SUDAN - GUIDANCE FOR SECURITY COUNCIL 
CONSULTATIONS ON 24 OCTOBER 2007 
 
¶1.  PURPOSE:  This is an action request.  The Department asks 
USUN to base its statement at the 24 October 2007 UN Security 
Council consultations on Sudan on the objectives in paragraph 
¶2. 
 
¶2.  OBJECTIVES: 
 
-To stress the linkage of resolution of the Darfur conflict, 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) implementation, and 
sustainable peace throughout Sudan. 
 
-To note that this linkage underlines the urgent need for:  a 
ceasefire by all parties; protection of civilians, including 
humanitarian workers; the rapid deployment of United Nations 
- African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID); active support 
for the CPA; and full participation in the Darfur peace talks 
commencing 27 October 2007 in Libya. 
 
------ 
UNAMID 
------ 
 
-To urge all parties (the Government of Sudan (GOS), United 
Nations (UN), African Union (AU), troop contributing 
countries, and international community) to facilitate the 
speedy deployment of UNAMID and the Light and Heavy Support 
Packages of UN assistance to the African Union Mission in 
Sudan (AMIS).  To stress the need for the UN to meet the 
deadlines for establishment of an initial operating 
capability and for transfer of responsibility from AMIS to 
UNAMID as laid out in UNSCR 1769. 
 
-To urge contributions for all of the remaining gaps in force 
generation for UNAMID. Current gaps consist of specialized 
units for UNAMID, including attack and utility helicopters 
and transport units. 
 
-To encourage donors to ensure that troop contributors have 
the capabilities for UNAMID to meet the necessary standards 
for effectiveness and sustainability. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
UNITED NATIONS MISSION IN SUDAN (UNMIS) 
--------------------------------------- 
 
-To urge all parties (the GOS, the Government of Southern 
Sudan, UNMIS, and the international community), to support 
vigorously the full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement, including through the strengthening of the 
Assessment and Evaluation Commission (AEC) and the convening 
of a high-level international meeting focused on 
implementation.  We are concerned by the Sudan People's 
Liberation Movement's recent move to suspend its 
participation in the Government of National Unity and call on 
all parties to redouble their efforts to implement the CPA in 
good faith. 
 
------------------------ 
DARFUR POLITICAL PROCESS 
------------------------ 
 
-To urge all parties (the rebels and the GOS) to participate 
in the UN-AU-led Darfur political process, which is scheduled 
to commence 27 October 2007 in Libya, and to negotiate in 
good faith toward attaining a settlement. 
 
-To urge all parties to exercise restraint from violence 
immediately, avoiding retaliation and escalation.  We deplore 
the most recent violence against AMIS and against civilians 
in Darfur.
