¶1. This cable contains an action request in para 3. 
 
¶2. DCM informed MFA Undersecretary Dalius Cekuolis March 8, 
per reftel, of the USG plan to assign a State Department 
Officer (retired FSO Michael Metrinko) and a USAID officer to 
the Lithuanian-led Provincial Reconstruction Team in 
Chagcharan, Afghanistan.  Cekuolis expressed delight at the 
USG's gesture, and said he would be interested in meeting 
Metrinko during Cekuolis's visit to Washington April 4-5. 
We understand, however, that Metrinko is likely to be in 
Afghanistan at that time. 
 
¶3. We request the Department's assistance in arranging a 
conference call between Metrinko and GOL officials before 
Metrinko departs for Afghanistan.  Alternatively, should 
Metrinko's schedule change making him available for a meeting 
with Cekuolis prior to Metrinko's departure for Afghanistan, 
we request that the Department facilitate such a meeting 
during the Undersecretary's visit.
