SUBJECT: BAD AROLSEN ARCHIVES AND SECOND PROTOCOL PROCEDURE 
 
 
¶1.  In a January 23, 2008 meeting with EUR/OHI's Ambassador 
¶J. Christian Kennedy, the MFA Legal Department's Krzystof 
Kocel said that all partner countries involved in the 
International Tracing Service (ITS) had completed their 
internal requirements for passage, and that the Second 
Protocol governing access to the World War II era archives in 
Bad Arolsen, Germany went into effect as of January 11, 2008. 
 Kocel said further that Poland, in its capacity as current 
chair of the International Commission of ITS, would arrange 
for a signing ceremony on February 5 or 6, 2008, on the 
occasion of the visit to Warsaw of Jakob Kellenberger, the 
President of the International Committee for the Red Cross 
(ICRC), which manages ITS. 
 
¶2.  With respect to signing the agreement with the ICRC, 
Kocel said the two final countries that passed the Second 
Protocol, France and Luxembourg, specifically authorized the 
ITS Chairman to sign the Second Protocol with Kellenberger. 
Kennedy advised Kocel that the United States does not need to 
take any additional steps with respect to the Second 
Protocol, and that our understanding was the plain language 
of the document authorizes the Chairman to act on behalf of 
all of the ITS member countries.  Kocel said that he was 
asking all of the countries in question to query capitals as 
to whether any further action was needed, and that he hoped 
to have an answer by February 1.  We believe no further 
action is required, but invite you to comment as necessary 
before that deadline.
