SUBJECT: LIBYA WORKING TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR SUBJECTS 
OF 1267 LISTING HOLDS 
 
REF: STATE 97379 
 
Â¶1. (C)  CDA met October 15 with Jalal Jaidi of the MFA's 
International Organizations office to discuss Libya's response 
to reftel demarche.  Jaidi said the GOL was working to develop 
additional supporting evidentiary and bio-identifier information 
on the eight USG holds and expected to provide that information 
in seven to ten days.  On the proposed visit of OFAC Director 
Adam Szubin to discuss 1267 listing modalities and 
counterterrorism finance, Jaidi said it was unlikely  that key 
GOL interlocutors for those issues would be available during the 
last week of October.  The GOL would strongly prefer that the 
visit be delayed until early November.
