SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050196112 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on license 050196122 for 
the export of International Traffic in Arms 
(ITAR)-controlled AH-1W helicopter parts and components to 
Taiwan.  Post is requested to complete this Blue Lantern 
inquiry within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern inquiry will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Unfamiliar consignee, Dali Sin Ya 
Co. Ltd. (DSY) (no licensing history);  no documentation 
from foreign end-user, Taiwan Ministry of National Defense 
(TMND); commodities with risk of diversion. 
 
¶4. ACTION: The Department requests that Post confirm that 
the Foreign End User, TMND, ordered the items listed for 
the purpose stated on the license application.  In 
addition, the Department requests that Post make inquiries 
with appropriate officials to establish the bona fides of 
DSY in the transaction.  Conduct a site visit to 
assess the company's reliability as a recipient of United 
States Munitions List (USML) articles as well as an 
assessment of the company's on-site security and 
operations.  If a site visit is not possible, please 
inform the PM/DTCC case officer. 
 
The following points are included for guidance: 
 
--Can DSY provide documentation that verifies the end-use 
of the helicopter components, such as a contract or 
purchase order from the TMND? 
 
--When was DSY established and who are its principals? 
 
--What is the nature of the company's businesses -- what 
type of items does it handle?  Does the company serve as a 
broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical 
customers and where are they located? 
 
--Does DSY understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized 
re-transfer and 
re-export? 
 
END ACTION.
