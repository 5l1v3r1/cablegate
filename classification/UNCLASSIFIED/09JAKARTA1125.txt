SUBJECT: UNGA -- INDONESIAN HIGH-LEVEL PARTICIPATION 
 
REF: STATE 68590 
 
In response to reftel instructions, Mission requested 
information regarding Indonesian high-level attendance at the 
64th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) via diplomatic 
note on July 2.  Mission will engage GOI interlocutors on 
this subject to try to secure initial information on 
attendance of Indonesian officials by August 1st, per reftel 
instructions.  In previous years, Indonesia did not finalize 
its UNGA high-level attendees' list until mid-August or 
later.  President Yudhoyono has led the Indonesian delegation 
in the past (though he did not go to New York last year).  He 
is currently up for re-election on July 8; if he wins by over 
50% of the vote, he will obviate the need for a second round 
runoff in September.
