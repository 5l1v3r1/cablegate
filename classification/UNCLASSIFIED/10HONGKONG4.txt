REF: A) BIS e-mail request 01210093 dated October 28, 2009 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) attempted 
to conduct a post shipment verification (PSV) at Honesty Electronic 
Tech Ltd., Room 601A, 6/F, Four Seas Building, 208-212 Nathan Road, 
Hong Kong (Honesty). The items in question for this PSV are various 
electronic components exported to Honesty on or about November 21, 
¶2007.  These items are likely classified under Export Control 
Classification Number (ECCN) 3A991 and are controlled for 
anti-terrorism (AT) reasons.  This ECCN is eligible for shipment to 
virtually all destinations, end users and end uses worldwide except 
certain sanctioned countries and restricted persons and end uses. 
The exporter is Abacus Industries of Naples, Florida. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Honesty has been 
in existence since 2005.  It has the Hong Kong equivalent of USD 
1250 in share capital.  Chen, Ji Hai (China Passport number 
K00710348) is listed as the company's sole director.  The company's 
corporate address is located at the offices of a company secretarial 
service. 
 
¶4.  Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan attempted for some time to 
arrange a meeting with a representative of Honesty.  Initially, the 
company secretarial service answered the phone for Honesty and a 
representative of Honesty (a Mr. Chan) returned the call. 
Subsequently, Mr. Chan's boss and the head of the company, Mr. Chen 
(presumably the company director listed above) stated that he was 
willing to meet with ECO but did not have a Hong Kong entry permit 
(he is located in mainland China).  Mr. Chen offered to obtain such 
a permit and revert with an appropriate meeting time.  Mr. Chen has 
not been in communication for some time and ECO is therefore closing 
out this PSV. 
 
¶5.  Based on the information on hand, it is difficult to make a 
conclusive determination of whether Honesty is a suitable recipient 
of U.S. origin technology. That is because the items in question may 
go to virtually all destinations and end users and uses and ECO has 
no specific information on hand that these items went to 
unauthorized destinations, uses or users. That said, the fact that 
Honesty is apparently unwilling (or unable) to meet with ECO is a 
concern as is the fact that Honesty claims on its web site that it 
is able to source military grade components (presumably for sale 
within Mainland China).  As a result, ECO believes Honesty to be an 
unsuitable recipient of U.S. origin technology.  In addition, ECO 
recommends a close review of all products being sent to Honesty that 
may be more highly controlled.
