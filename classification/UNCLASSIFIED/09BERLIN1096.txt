¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The net number of confirmed H1N1 infections 
in 
Germany rose by 681 cases to 17,265 cases on September 8.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U)  At its September 8 press briefing, the National 
Reference Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute 
(RKI) confirmed a total of 698 new (laboratory and non- 
laboratory) H1N1 cases in Germany over Thursday, September 3, 
and subtracted 17 previously confirmed cases.  This net 
increase of 681 cases brings the total to 17,265.  Seventeen 
H1N1 infections previously confirmed in Hesse were rescinded. 
New cases were distributed among fifteen federal states as 
follows: Hesse (-17), Baden-Wuerttemberg (224), Bavaria (157), 
Lower-Saxony (54), North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) (44), 
Brandenburg (40), Berlin (35), Rhineland-Palatinate (33), 
Schleswig- 
Holstein (33), Saxony-Anhalt (28), Hamburg (16), Saarland 
(12), Thuringia (8), Saxony (7), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (5) 
and Bremen (2).  New cases include non-laboratory H1N1 cases 
that exhibited symptoms after being in contact with a 
laboratory-confirmed infected person. 
 
¶4. (U)  NRW remains the German state with the highest number 
of confirmed virus cases with a total of 5,238, followed by 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (2,648 cases) and Lower-Saxony (2,531). 
The number of all confirmed infections in Germany that have 
resulted from domestic transmission increased to 26 percent. 
To date, there have been no reported deaths in Germany due to 
H1N1. 
 
¶5. (U)  An official from the Ministry of Health told us today 
that Germany will receive its H1N1 vaccine from 
GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis.
