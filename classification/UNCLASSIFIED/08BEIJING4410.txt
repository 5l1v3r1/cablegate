Dalai Lama and European Union 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. It is "time for France to make the right choice" and "create the 
right atmosphere" for a China-European Union Summit said MFA 
spokesperson Liu Jianchao at the December 2 MFA press briefing when 
asked about French President Nicolas Sarkozy's planned meeting with 
the Dalai Lama.  Liu said that Sarkozy is "still bent on meeting 
with the Dalai Lama" despite China's "clear position."  Liu noted 
that the delay in the China-EU meeting is "affecting relations" but 
this is "the result of the French leader's insistence on 
disregarding Chinese concerns."   China "attaches great importance" 
to its "strategic partnership with France," said Liu.  Asked about 
calls on the Chinese Internet to boycott French goods, Liu said that 
he "hopes citizens will take a calm attitude towards China-France 
bilateral relations."  Asked about the Dalai Lama's statements that 
he would like to visit Taiwan, Liu said "both Taiwan and Tibet are 
inalienable parts of Chinese territory" and China "opposes the Dalai 
Lama's separatist activity." 
 
Strategic Economic Dialogue 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. China hopes that the United States and China will "have full and 
adequate discussions on areas of mutual interest" during the 
upcoming Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) and expects that this 
round of talks will "achieve success."  Facts have "proven that 
previous SED rounds have played a positive role in promoting" trade 
relations between the two sides, said Liu.  China is "ready to work 
with the new administration to strengthen cooperation on trade," 
added Liu. 
 
Reaction to Cabinet Picks 
------------------------ 
 
¶4. The spokesman referred reporters to Foreign Minister Yang 
Jiechi's message to President-elect Barack Obama's announced choices 
for Secretary of State and National Security Advisor.  Yang is 
"looking forward to working with both to promote bilateral 
relations," said Liu.  Asked about Secretary of State-designee 
Hillary Clinton's previous criticisms of China, Liu said "it is true 
we have some disputes" with the United States, however, it is 
important to "have dialogue" on these issues.  Regarding Clinton's 
previous criticism of the Beijing Olympics Liu noted that the 
Beijing Olympics were held successfully and President Bush's 
attendance "was a good choice for mutual understanding" between the 
two nations. 
 
 
Mumbai Terror Attacks 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. The recent terror attacks in Mumbai are "shocking" and the 
Chinese Government has expressed its "solicitude to the Indian 
Government and people." Liu noted that investigations into who 
perpetrated the attack are ongoing.  China is "ready to work with 
the international community and India to crack down on terror." 
 
Six-Party Talks 
--------------- 
 
¶6. Asked about the "delay" in the next round of the Six-Party Talks, 
Liu said that China had "proposed to host" the next round of Talks 
on December 8 and is "waiting for the five other parties" to agree. 
China "expects to hold the meetings as scheduled," said Liu. 
 
China-ROK High-Level Strategic Dialogue 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
BEIJING 00004410  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶7. The China-South Korea High-Level Strategic Dialogue will be held 
in Beijing on Dec 11.  The dialogue is "based on the consensus of 
the two countries' leaders." The dialogue will serve to "strengthen 
communication and coordination" as well as allow a platform for the 
"exchange of views." 
 
Thailand Unrest 
--------------- 
 
¶8. China expresses "concern" over the situation in Thailand and 
"hopes the country returns to social stability and economic 
development," said Liu. The spokesman noted that China had arranged 
for 3,100 of its citizens to leave Thailand on 11 chartered flights 
so far. 
 
Cluster Munitions Ban 
--------------------- 
 
¶9. Asked about China's position on cluster munitions, Liu said that 
China "takes seriously the humanitarian problems caused by the 
misuse of cluster munitions."  China has "taken actions to be a 
constructive part" of the solution to this problem. 
 
Milk Crisis 
----------- 
 
¶10. The spokesman referred reporters to "competent authorities" to 
answer a question on the milk crisis.  Liu did say, however, that 
the "Chinese government took the problem seriously." The problem is 
"now basically solved and all sickened babies have been treated." 
 
Belgian Journalist 
------------------ 
 
¶11. Asked about a reported case of a Belgian journalist being beaten 
in China, Liu said that he had only heard of the case from the 
Xinhua News Agency and could not confirm the story.  Liu noted that 
the journalist could have called local authorities or the MFA to 
assist him, but he did not do so.  Reporters should "not blindly 
blame local authorities" for the incident.
