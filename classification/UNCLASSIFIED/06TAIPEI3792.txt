SUBJECT: DPP Candidate Chen Chu Sits Out First Kaohsiung City 
Mayoral Debate 
 
REF:  2005 TAIPEI 3856 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  The TVBS TV Station hosted the first televised 
Kaohsiung mayoral election debate on November 5.  Although all three 
major mayoral candidates were invited, only the Kuomintang (KMT) 
candidate Huang Chun-ying and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) 
candidate Lo Chih-ming attended, debating major issues such as 
corruption, unemployment and the economy.  The Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Chen Chu declined to participate 
because of lack of time to prepare and concerns about the pro-Blue 
stance of TVBS.  According to recent media polling, only Huang 
Chun-ying and Chen Chu have realistic chances of winning the 
December 9 election, with Lo Chih-ming polling at low single digits. 
 End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chen Chu's assistant 
told AIT/K that Chen Chu did not have enough preparation time due to 
the short notice given by TVBS and that she was also concerned about 
the pro-blue stance of TVBS.  Chen's assistant noted that KMT 
candidate Huang Chun-ying had declined an invitation to a debate 
from pro-green Formosa TV, causing that debate to be cancelled. 
Kaohsiung's KMT Chairman Hsu Fu-ming had said in an earlier 
conversation with AIT/K that previous interviews with Huang 
Chun-ying had been edited for negative sound bytes by Formosa TV, 
causing Huang to be especially wary of the debate proposed by that 
television station. 
 
Main Issues - Unemployment, Economy, cleanliness in politics and age 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
¶3. (U) During this debate, the KMT Candidate Huang Chun-ying and the 
TSU candidate Lo Chih-ming both emphasized unemployment as a 
 
SIPDIS 
critical issue in Kaohsiung and they concurred that boosting 
Kaohsiung's economy was essential.  Huang argued that "direct-links 
with China" under conditions of national safety and sovereignty, 
could positively boost the economy, while Lo advocated developing 
hi-tech industries as the solution. 
 
¶4.  (U) Both candidates emphasized their own integrity and untainted 
careers, and both said they were committed to continue the 
investigation into the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corporation (KRTC) 
scandal (reftel).  Lo, however, reminded people of previous and 
on-going corruption scandals involving both the KMT and the DPP.  He 
argued that a clean TSU candidate should be the best choice for 
mayor in the upcoming election. 
 
¶5.  (U) Age was another issue in the debate as Huang is 65 and Lo is 
¶49.  Lo argued that his younger age would make him more energetic in 
performing his duties, just like former U.S. President Clinton. 
Huang stressed that he was still full of energy, and maintained that 
being a mayor was like conducting an orchestra, putting the right 
people in right place, at the right time. 
 
Conclusion - Time for a change 
------------------------------ 
¶6.  (U) Both Huang and Lo emphasized that changing government 
through the democratic process was legitimate and necessary.  Huang 
asserted that the DPP lacked administrative ability and that its 
links to corruption in the KRTC scandal had hampered the city's 
development.   Lo, on the other hand, urged people to vote for him 
to avoid a continuing power struggle between the Green and Blue 
camps, and to reduce possible linkages between the outcome of this 
mayoral election and the upcoming legislature and presidential 
elections. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Fearing a possible split in the Green camp, AIT/K contacts 
have told post that TSU's Lo has been under heavy pressure by 
pro-independence social groups, like the Southern Taiwan 
Association, to withdraw from the race. However, Lo clearly stated 
in this debate that he will not drop out from the race for any 
reason.  In this first televised debate, Lo impressed people with 
his eloquence as well as with his tough and firm image.  Although 
the debate can hardly increase Lo's popularity enough to win him the 
election, it could draw votes away from the DPP's Chen Chu.  During 
the debate, the KMT candidate, as usual, showed his gentle and mild 
personality.  KMT Kaohsiung City Chairman Hsu has told AIT/K that he 
noticed the drawbacks of Huang's soft image in campaign events and 
 
TAIPEI 00003792  002 OF 002 
 
 
planned to hire a public relations consultant to improve his image 
and enhance his campaign. 
 
Note: Next Debate on November 19 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) The three major candidates will meet in the next televised 
debate scheduled for November 19, which will be sponsored jointly by 
the Public Television Services and four print media (i.e. China 
Times, United Daily News, Liberty Time and Apple Daily).
