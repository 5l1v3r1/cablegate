¶1.  In response to reftel, Embassy Quito's Terrorist Finance 
Coordination Officer (TFCO) is DCM Jefferson Brown, telephone 
number 593-2-256-2890 ext. 4420.  His unclassified email 
address is brownjt2@state.gov.  The Deputy TFCO is Economic 
Officer Christian Bollinger, telephone number 593-2-256-2890 
ext. 4464.  His email address is bollingercj@state.gov. 
 
¶2.  Post is providing technical support through the 
Organization of American States (OAS) Inter-American Drug 
Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) and the American Bar 
Association (ABA) to implement Ecuador's Money Laundering Law 
passed in late October 2005.  A critical aspect of making the 
new law effective will be establishing a Financial 
Intelligence Unit (FIU).  While there has been good progress 
in some aspects of creating the FIU, the selection of a 
Director has been stalled due, in large part, to the 
uncertainty created by the 2006 Presidential elections. 
 
¶3.  In spite of this setback, the GOE has used the new law to 
initiate a large money laundering case against members of a 
Colombian drug organization with significant assets in 
Ecuador.  The Narcotics Affairs Section is also providing 
technical assistance through the ABA to help Ecuadorian 
prosecutors and judges to effectively adjudicate this and 
other money laundering cases. 
 
¶4.  The Political and Public Affairs sections have used 
private and public diplomacy to increase support for 
combating money laundering, while the Economic section works 
with the Superintendent of Banks and others on the issue, 
with special attention to terrorist financing.  DEA 
investigations also contribute to these mission objectives. 
 
¶5.  Our key short-term priorities continue to be the 
effective implementation of the recent money laundering law 
and more effective regulation of the banking sector.  Post 
would welcome any program of technical assistance that would 
help us meet those priorities.
