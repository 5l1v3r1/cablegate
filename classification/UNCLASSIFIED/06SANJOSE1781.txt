RESOLUTION DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 132517 
 
¶1.  (U) On August 12, as instructed per Reftel, DCM provided 
copies of the non-paper, the Secretary's statement and UNSCR 
1701 to Antonio Alarcon, Chief of Staff for FonMin Stagno. 
DCM and Pol/C followed up with a meeting with Alarcon at OOB 
on August 14.  DCM reiterated the importance of not only 
ending the Israeli-Hezbollah violence immediately, but also 
of creating the conditions for a durable ceasefire.  DCM also 
stressed that UNSCR 1701 was only the first step in that 
process. 
 
¶2.  (U) Alarcon understood the importance of the issue, 
noting that a peaceful resolution to the conflict was also 
important to the GOCR because of Costa Rican business 
interests in the Middle East.  He thanked the DCM for our 
timely approach.  Alarcon had earlier passed the non-paper 
and resolution to the FM, and was to meet with Stagno and 
Amb. Duenas, visiting from Washington, immediately after our 
session.  Alarcon promised to provide an official reaction in 
the next few days.
