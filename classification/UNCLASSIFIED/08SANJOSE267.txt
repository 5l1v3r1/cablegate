REF: A. STATE 22315 
 
     ¶B. 05 SAN JOSE 0051 
 
¶1. Per Ref A request, on March 12, we met with Rafael Polini, 
the owner of Mundi Arms of San Jose and established the bona 
fides of the company.  We consider Mundi Arms of San Jose a 
legitimate recipient of United States Munition List items and 
Polini was knowledgeable of the International Traffic in Arms 
Regulation (ITAR).  Polini added that he was very familiar 
with regulations governing the import of U.S.-origin defense 
articles, including restrictions on re-transfer or re-export. 
 
¶2. Mundi Arms of San Jose has been in business since 1994, 
but derives from a company that Polini's father founded in 
¶1937.  Polini has a brother, Eduardo Polini, who also has an 
arms business and was the subject of a previous Blue Lantern 
check in 2005 (Ref B).  The two brothers separated their 
businesses in 1993-94. 
 
¶3. Mundi Arms sells rifles, shotguns, revolvers, pistols, and 
related accessories of all brands and calibers.  The most 
common and most sold items are .38 and .22 caliber pistols. 
His office maintains files on all of their customers and 
sends a monthly report to the Arms and Explosives section of 
the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), the GOCR ministry 
responsible for oversight.  In addition, the MPS regularly 
inspects the store (usually once a week) to review sales 
receipts and records. 
 
¶4. Polini told us that all prospective customers must have a 
background check, proof of firearms safety course, and 
psychological test.  His customers are mostly local hunters 
and citizens concerned with self-defense.  All of his 
customers reside in Costa Rica and, due to GOCR regulations, 
he cannot sell weapons to foreigners. 
 
¶5. The store, located in the heart of downtown San Jose near 
the intersection of Avenue Zero and Second Street, has a 
monitored ADT security system.  During non-business hours, 
there is an armed security guard present outside the store 
and iron security curtains are pulled down to physically 
secure the premises.  We observed three security cameras, two 
directed at the entrance and one towards the display counter, 
controlled by a monitor in Polini's office.

COMMENT 
======= 
 
¶6. In Costa Rica the name "Polini" is synonymous with arms 
sales and has a respectable reputation throughout the 
country.  Although Costa Rica does not have a military, it 
does have a police force that is stretched to the limit due 
to rising rates of crime.  More and more Costa Ricans, a 
generally peaceful population who would not normally purchase 
firearms, are buying weapons for self-defense due to the 
deteriorating domestic security situation.
