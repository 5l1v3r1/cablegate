SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: THE DPP'S "NORMAL COUNTRY RESOLUTION" 
 
¶1. Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage September 27 on the police crackdown of peaceful 
anti-government protesters in Yangon, Myanmar Wednesday; on the 
DPP's controversial "normal country resolution;" and on DPP Chairman 
Yu Shyi-kun's announcement of his resignation today.  Several major 
Chinese-language papers also reported on their inside pages AIT 
Taipei Director Stephen Young's meeting with Legislative Speaker 
Wang Jin-pyng Wednesday, in which Young told Wang that Washington 
will give neither a price quote nor a letter of consent by the end 
of October for the 60 F-16C/D fighter jets that Taiwan intends to 
buy. 
 
¶2. In terms of editorials and commentaries, an editorial in the 
centrist, KMT-leaning "China Times" criticized the DPP for playing 
the word game with regard to the phrasing in the party's "normal 
country resolution."  An op-ed in the pro-independence, 
English-language "Taipei Times," however, urged the DPP to include 
the words "correcting the nation's official title to Taiwan" in its 
"normal country resolution."  End summary. 
 
A) "How Many Times More Is [Taiwan] Going to Play Such a Word Game 
as in the '[Normal County] Resolution?'" 
 
The centrist, KMT-leaning "China Times" [circulation: 400,000] 
editorialized (9/27): 
 
"... The debut of 'Bian's version of the [normal country] 
resolution,' if judged from a positive perspective, can be viewed as 
[a result created by] Chen Shui-bian, who has finally sensed 
pressure from the international community and decided pragmatically 
to adjust all the rallies [he has mobilized] calling for rectifying 
Taiwan's name, and restrict them for domestic consumption only.  In 
other words, [Chen] has set the tone for the DPP's campaigning for 
the 2008 presidential election, which will focus on the UN 
referendum and will not involve the writing of a new constitution 
and changing the island's national name. 
 
"Regardless of the question of whether such an adjustment will be 
able to convince the United States, what really matters is whether 
[the resolution] will be able to convince the middle-of-the-road 
voters in Taiwan, who have tried to put up with the DPP's 
ideological governance style for more than seven years.  When will 
the DPP, which has been established for 21 years and become the 
ruling party for over seven years, be willing to stop doing so? ..." 
 
 
B) "Resolution Must Include 'Taiwan'" 
 
Cao Changqing, a Chinese free-lance political commentator based in 
the U.S., opined in the pro-independence "Taipei Times" 
[circulation: 30,000] (9/27): 
 
"... The name 'Taiwan' is the DPP's trump card.  Dropping this card 
and following Ma toward the center would be a mistake in the 
principle as well as in strategy.  Playing the 'Taiwan' card can not 
only consolidate the pan-green camp, but also build support for the 
DPP.  Statistics from the Government Information Office show there 
have been more than 1,600 reports published by the international 
media reflecting the Taiwanese government's active UN bid this year. 
 This figure is four to eight time more than in past years. ... 
 
"Clearly, only if Taiwanese speak up and reveal the truth will they 
be able to elicit sincere support. ...  At the same time, all DPP 
supporters should advocate the inclusion of the words 'correcting 
the nation's official tile to Taiwan' in the 'normal country 
resolution.'  History is in the making."
