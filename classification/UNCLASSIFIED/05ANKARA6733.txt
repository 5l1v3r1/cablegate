¶1. This message contains an action request in para 4. 
 
¶2. GOT MFA contacted us on November 14 to request USG 
support for their Category C candidate in the upcoming 
IMO elections.  Per ref A, Econoff informed the GOT of 
the US's Category A candidate and requested GOT support. 
MFA attache in the Maritime and Aviation Affairs 
Department Murat Ugurluoglu suggested a reciprocal 
arrangement in which the U.S. supports Turkey's 
reelection and Turkey does the same for the US.  Econoff 
agreed to send this proposal back to Washington for 
consideration but added that the embassy could not make 
commitments on behalf of the US IMO delegation and asked 
that Ugurluoglu ensure that Turkey's embassy in 
Washington approach the department with its request. 
 
¶3. Comment:  The GOT has traditionally supported U.S. 
positions in the IMO.  Most recently the Department 
asked post to thank the GOT for its support (ref B), to 
which MFA Head of the Maritime Department Basat Ozturk 
pledged to continue (ref C).  Understanding Washington's 
probable reluctance to link the two candidacies (which 
was more likely some quick thinking on the part of the 
MFA officer rather than GOT policy), it would be a good 
thing from our point of view if the U.S. could support 
Turkey.  Post requests Department's guidance.
