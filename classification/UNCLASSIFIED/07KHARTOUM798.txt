SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) UN agencies are crucial to the provision and coordination of 
humanitarian assistance in Darfur.  The UN agencies provide 
important leadership, through coordinating a wide variety of 
assistance activities, acting as a liaison between the humanitarian 
community and the Sudanese government, and directing provision of 
common humanitarian services.  Continued support for UN agencies is 
vital to maintaining the large humanitarian effort underway in 
Darfur.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶2. (U) The USAID Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance 
(USAID/OFDA) supports six UN agencies in Darfur: the UN Office for 
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) the UN Children's 
Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Program (WFP), the UN World Health 
Organization (WHO), the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 
and the UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS).  In Fiscal 
Year 2006, USAID/OFDA funding for the six UN agencies totaled USD 
27.5 million. 
 
¶3. (U) This cable provides an overview of the UN's important role in 
Darfur.

COORDINATING SERVICES AND LIAISING WITH THE GNU 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4. (U) Overall coordination of humanitarian assistance is led by 
OCHA, both in Khartoum and in the three Darfur states, with weekly 
coordination meetings for UN agencies, as well as international and 
national non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  OCHA also plays an 
important role in liaising with the Sudanese government on behalf of 
the humanitarian community.  Other UN agencies, such as UNICEF, WHO, 
and FAO coordinate sector-level activities in health, nutrition, 
food security, and water, sanitation, and hygiene. 
 
¶5. (U) The UN agencies also work closely with the Government of 
National Unity (GNU) ministries, building capacity and assisting 
with tracking NGO service provision.  During the summer of 2006, 
UNICEF and WHO led agencies in planning for the prevention and 
treatment of reported cholera cases in Darfur.  The two agencies 
coordinated efforts undertaken by a myriad of international NGOs, as 
well as the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the GNU's water and 
sanitation authority.

COMMON SERVICES AND TECHNICAL LEADERSHIP 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Relief commodities for Darfur are provided through a common 
pipeline, which is a joint effort of UNICEF, CARE, and the UN Joint 
Logistics Center (UNJLC).  UNICEF procures the commodities, 
including plastic sheeting, blankets, sleeping mats, water 
containers, and women's clothing. CARE transports the commodities to 
distribution sites across Darfur, and UNJLC coordinates and 
documents the process.  The common pipeline enables NGOs to order 
and receive the relief commodities free of charge in the needed 
locations, either as initial assistance to newly displaced 
populations or to provide for particularly vulnerable households in 
camps and to replace hygiene supplies. 
 
¶7. (U) WFP operates the UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS).  UNHAS 
flies between Khartoum and the three Darfur states and has 
helicopters that transfer passengers from the three state capitals 
to operational areas that are inaccessible by road due to 
insecurity.  As insecurity has reduced access throughout Darfur 
since May 2006, helicopters are the only means for humanitarian 
workers to reach populations throughout Darfur.  With funding from 
bilateral donors, including USAID and the Common Humanitarian Fund, 
UNHAS now operates two helicopters in each of the three Darfur 
states, enabling twice weekly flights to many destinations and 
providing evacuation capability for aid workers in remote areas. 
Passengers are charged for flights, but the operation is subsidized 
by donor funding.  UNHAS charges passengers USD 40 per person for 
intra-Darfur flights and USD 100 for Khartoum to Darfur flights. 
Commercial airlines operate Khartoum to Darfur flights for USD 120, 
 
KHARTOUM 00000798  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
and have intra-Darfur connections to all three Darfur states. 
 
¶8. (U) UNICEF, WHO, and FAO provide technical leadership in their 
respective sectors:  health, child protection, agriculture and food 
security, nutrition, and water, sanitation, and hygiene.   Recently, 
WHO has improved the Early Warning and Response System's (EWARS) 
reporting capacity throughout Darfur.  Previously, EWARS relied on 
reporting from international NGOs, and when NGOs could not access 
certain areas reporting ceased from those locations.  To remedy 
this, WHO identified and trained local health officers to provide 
weekly reporting.  As of the last EWARS bulletin, 88 percent of 
locations reported.  WHO provided training to local health officers, 
as well as medical kits, diagnostic kits, and communications 
equipment, including satellite phones and scratch cards, to enable 
the officers to conduct tests and report results.  WHO expects the 
true test of the new reporting system to occur with the early 
detection of malaria and acute watery diarrhea during the upcoming 
rainy season.  EWARS has already performed well in the early 
detection of meningitis cases, which requires daily reporting.

COMMENTS 
-------- 
 
¶9. (U) USAID needs to encourage the UN to implement a cluster 
approach in Darfur.  Currently, the protection sector lead is the UN 
Mission in Sudan Protection Unit (UNMIS/Protection) that operates 
under the leadership of the UNMIS Darfur Coordinator.  This 
structure hampers the sector's effectiveness as the Darfur 
Coordinator plays a political and representational role for the UN 
in Darfur. 
 
¶10. (U) Currently, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) is planning to engage in IDP camp coordination 
activities in Darfur.  However, UNHCR has no memorandum of 
understanding with the GNU and is operational only in West Darfur. 
If the UN decides to employ a cluster approach in Darfur, close 
coordination between the International Organization for Migration, 
OCHA, and UNHCR will be needed to ensure effective IDP camp 
management and circumvent GNU administrative impediments.
