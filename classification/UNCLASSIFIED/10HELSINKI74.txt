SUBJECT: FINLAND: GOLDSTONE FOLLOW-UP ACTION 
 
REF: STATE 015722 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Pol/Econoff delivered reftel remarks to Riikka 
Eela, Regional Manager for the Middle East Unit in the Bureau 
of Middle East and North African Affairs at the MFA.  When 
Pol/Econoff thanked the GOF for having abstained from the 
earlier vote on the Goldstone Report Eela indicated that this 
abstention occurred because the GOF will not accept any 
resolution that presses for Security Council action on the 
Goldstone Report.  She reinforced this point later in the 
conversation when she said that using the Security Council 
for a Goldstone-related resolution is a red line for almost 
all of the EU. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The GOF sees many areas in which it agrees with the 
reftel's talking points including: 
--Israel has the democratic institutions to ensure an 
effective and accountable investigation. 
--The main responsibility for investigations is with the two 
parties, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. 
--That the Secretary General is correct when stating that it 
is too early in the process investigative process to be able 
to evaluate them. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The GOF continues to disagree with the USG use of 
"alleged crimes" when referring to the report and prefers to 
use "reported crimes" because, in the GOF view, this adds 
credibility to the reports of the crimes.  Also, the GOF is 
disappointed that reftel talking points do not note that the 
current draft of the resolution is much more balanced than 
the previous draft.  Eela made the point that positive 
recognition should be given to the Palestinian Authority for 
resisting regional pressure to put forth a more one-sided 
resolution focused solely against Israel's actions. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In response to specific reftel points, Eela stated 
the following: 
--The GOF does not see the reference to East Jerusalem as 
being part of the Palestine occupied territory as a problem. 
--The EU has always stated that it does not accept the 
annexations made in the wake of the 1967 war. 
--While Hamas's role in the Gaza fighting is not specifically 
mentioned it is addressed in principal in the current 
resolution. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Eela finished by saying that the GOF does not yet 
have a final position on this paper but the initial view is 
that the current draft is much more balanced than the 
previous versions.
