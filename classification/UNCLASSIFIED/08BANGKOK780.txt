SUBJECT: SOMALIA AND PIRACY: REQUEST FOR FURTHER INFORMATION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 18101 
 
¶1. (SBU) Please see paragraph two for questions from Thai MFA 
Africa Director Tomwit Jarnson regarding reftel request. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Poloff on March 11 conveyed reftel points eliciting 
Thai assistance in addressing piracy off the Somali coast and 
views on a United Nations Security Council resolution to MFA 
Africa Division Director Tomwit Jarnson.  Tomwit expressed 
interest in the idea of a Security Council resolution, 
particularly because Thai vessels and citizens have been 
victimized by pirates in this vicinity.  Tomwit said he 
needed to coordinate any response internally, and said some 
further information would be helpful: Have consultations with 
the TFG begun?  If so, what stage are they in?  What is the 
intended scope of the resolution?  Would a resolution apply 
to Somali waters only, or be intended to address piracy 
generally? Finally, how would the resolution affect the 
territorial waters of the surrounding states.  Tomwit was not 
prepared to provide the Thai government's views on these 
questions prior to internal consultations. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Regarding direct assistance, Tomwit said Thailand's 
presence and interests in Africa were extremely limited. 
Although he supports the multinational effort to patrol the 
waters off the Somali coast, any kind of direct assistance on 
the part of Thailand would be extremely difficult.  Tomwit 
said this too would require internal consultations.
