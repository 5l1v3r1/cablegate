SUBJECT: AUTHORIZATION TO PRESENT TWO U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MOUS ON 
COOPERATION IN THE EARTH SCIENCES TO BRAZIL FOR SIGNATURE 
 
¶1.  In September 2004, Circular 175 Authority was granted to the 
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to negotiate and conclude two 
Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) between the USGS of the 
Department of Interior of the United States and two Brazilian 
institutions.  The first Brazilian entity is the Federal University 
of Rio Grande do Norte (in Natal).  The second is the Institute of 
Geosciences of the University of Brasilia.  The MOUs were negotiated 
but not signed. 
 
¶2.  Both MOUs provide a framework for the exchange of scientific and 
technical knowledge and the augmentation of scientific and technical 
capabilities between the USGS and the two Brazilian institutions 
with respect to the earth sciences.  PDF copies of these MOUs are 
available by email.  Contact Daisy da Costa at costadbd@state.gov. 
 
¶3.  Post requires confirmation by cable from L/OES and USGS to send 
the two documents to the Brazilian Foreign Ministry via diplomatic 
note to begin the process for signature.
