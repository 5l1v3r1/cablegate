A/DCM spoke with Honduran Vice Foreign Minister (VFM) Anibal 
Quinones at 0900 October 17 about the Central American 
Presidents' call for a special OAS Permanent Council session 
to demonstrate support for the elected government in 
Nicaragua.  VFM Quinones welcomed U.S. support and urged the 
U.S. to be in contact with other countries in the region. 
A/DCM explained that U.S. was seeking support for the Central 
American Presidents' initiative in other capitals.  Quinones 
said he would relay our support to the President and be in 
touch if the Government of Honduras had any additional ideas 
on how the OAS could support President Bolanos in Nicarauga.
