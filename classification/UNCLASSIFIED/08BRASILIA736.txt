SUBJECT:  BRAZIL LAUNCHES FORUM ON ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE 
CHANGE 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  The Brazilian Institute of Applied Economic Research 
(IPEA) has launched a climate change forum to focus on analyzing the 
main economic, social, and environmental impacts of climate change. 
IPEA has a demonstrated reputation of substantial experience in the 
economic valuation of environmental impacts.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  The Brazilian Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA) held 
an event on May 14 to launch the IPEA Forum on Climate Change.  This 
forum focuses on analyzing the main economic, social, and 
environmental impacts of climate change in the country.  The IPEA 
Forum proposes to develop a long term plan (for the next 100 years) 
to improve Brazil's public policies and to prepare the country for 
the possible impacts of climate change.  The launching was hosted by 
IPEA, Senate representatives, the Director of the Center for 
Sustainable Development (University of Brasilia), the Ministry of 
Science and Technology, and the Brazilian Ambassador for Climate 
Change, Sergio Barbosa Serra. 
 
¶3.  IPEA, a government-led Brazilian research institution which 
guides government planning and policy based on state-of-the-art 
research has worked with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 
the past and has substantial experience in the economic valuation of 
environmental impacts.  IPEA's Forum on Climate Change will likely 
collaborate with INPE (Brazil's national space research institute) 
in obtaining access to satellite-based land use monitoring data. 
 
¶4.  Although Brazil has had an official Forum on Climate Change 
since 2000, past meetings have been infrequent and closed to the 
public.  According to the Ministry of Science and Technology the 
2000 Forum is composed of all twelve ministries, the Brazilian 
Agency of Water Resources (ANA), and representatives of the civil 
society.  It is not clear how IPEA's Forum will fit in the context 
of the broader Brazilian Forum on Climate Change.  Additional 
information about the IPEA Forum can be found at:
