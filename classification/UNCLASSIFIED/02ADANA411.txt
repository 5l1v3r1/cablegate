¶2.  CONTINUED PRO-OCALAN DEMONSTRATIONS 
(Evrensel)  Isolation of PKK (KADEK) leader Abdullah Ocalan 
was protested in Diyarbakir and Batman.  In Diyarbakir, a 
group of youths gathered in front of the Church of Saint 
Mary and marched by displaying the KADEK flag and shouting 
pro-Ocalan slogans.  Residents gave support by applauding. 
The youths said they would increase their demonstrations 
between December 15 and February 15.  In Batman, similar 
protest demonstrations were held in eleven different 
locations. 
 
 
¶3.  ADANA BAR ASSOCIATION WILL HELP HUMAN RIGHTS VICTIMS 
(Milliyet/Bolge/Milli Gazete/Evrensel)  Attorney Ismail 
Arisoy, in charge of the Human Rights Commission of the 
Adana Bar Association, encouraged victims of human rights 
violations to apply to his commission.  Speaking at a 
meeting to mark Human Rights Week, Arisoy said the 
commission had been formed to come up with concrete 
solutions to human rights abuses, in collaboration with 
other organizations and institutions. 
 
 
¶4.  OFFICER TO PAY REPARATIONS FOR INSULTING A SUBORDINATE 
(Radikal/Sabah)  The Military Supreme Administrative Court 
(MSAC) ordered a first lieutenant to pay second lieutenant 
Kemal Vuraldogan TL 300 million (approx. USD 190) in 
reparations for insulting him.  Vuraldogan served his 
compulsory military duty at the 9th Main Jet Base Command 
(in Diyarbakir) in 2000.  MSAC's verdict stemmed from 
Vuraldogan's filing suit against the first lieutenant.

(Evrensel)  Eleven cleaning workers at the Pervari (Siirt) 
Regional Boarding School were reportedly dismissed on 
November 28 for participating in the November 3 rally of 
the Democratic People's Party (DEHAP) in Pervari.  The 
workers filed suit against the school principal for firing 
and insulting them.  The principal re-hired six of the 
workers when they withdrew their complaints.  The remaining 
five workers said they would petition the Administrative 
Court as the Prosecutor's Office had decided not to pursue 
the case. 
 
 
¶6.  WARNING AGAINST NON-TURKISH BUSINESS NAMES 
(Turkiye)  The Malatya Governor's Office sent an order to 
the Malatya Municipality warning against non-Turkish names 
given to places of business.  "English is being taught even

should not precede Turkish," Governor Mustafa Yildirim 
said.
