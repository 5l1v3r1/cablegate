SUBJECT: FRENTE'S GENERAL ASSEMBLY OPENS WAY FOR FTA TALKS 
 
 
¶1.   On  March 25, the General Assembly of  the  Frente 
Amplio  (FA) overwhelmingly rejected a motion from  the 
Communist  Party,  which would have modified  the  FA's 
program  to explicitly prohibit any FTA talks with  the 
U.S.   By doing so, the FA implicitly allowed President 
Vazquez  to open up FTA negotiations with the  U.S.  or 
any other country.  The Assembly approved a declaration 
calling on the GOU to ""deepen the Government's national 
policy  to amplify and strengthen the country's foreign 
trade,  in  order to achieve greater independence  from 
the  sole regional market (Mercosur)"".  The declaration 
also stated that ""there are no ideological restrictions 
preventing  the expansion of trade with the  U.S.""  and 
that ""the bilateral option is legitimate as long as  it 
does  not  cause prejudice to the country's  production 
and to regional integration."" 
 
¶2.   Press  reports indicated that the Socialists,  who 
had  originally  planned  on supporting  the  Communist 
motion, changed their mind, apparently due to President 
Vazquez'  work behind the scenes.  It was also reported 
that  Chile's President Bachelet's comments to  Vazquez 
on her visit here regarding the benefits of Chile's FTA 
with the U.S. had made a positive impact.  Reactions to 
the  FA  vote were varied, with everyone, surprisingly, 
claiming  victory.   Left-wing newspaper  La  Republica 
blared  that  the  ""FA had buried the  FTA""  (with  the 
U.S.),  while right-of-center El Pais titled that  ""the 
FA  has given a de facto approval to FTA negotiations."" 
It is true that the decision is vague enough for people 
to  read what they want.  The important point, however, 
is  that  a specific rejection of an FTA with the  U.S. 
was overwhelmingly voted down. 
 
¶3.   Ambito Financiero, a respected Argentine  business 
daily,   led  its  Monday  edition  with  a  commentary 
entitled   ""The   Uruguayan   Left   authorizes   trade 
negotiations with the U.S."".  The commentary notes that 
the  Uruguayan  Left appears to be  signaling  that  it 
wants  to  look  like Chile's Left,  moving  away  from 
ideology and towards a project of economic growth.   It 
adds  that the solitary opposition of the far-left  did 
not  manage to slow down an idea supported even by  the 
Tupamaros  (Note:  In his weekend  radio  address,  MPP 
Leader   Mujica  was  calling  on  Uruguayans  to   rid 
themselves  of  ideology  and  to  look  at  the  world 
realistically,  ""for the sake of  our  children"".   End 
Note.)  Ambito Financiero also commented that the  FA's 
vote  could be interpreted as a clear message to Brazil 
and  Argentina, whose exclusive bilateral  relationship 
within  Mercosur  was  widely  criticized  during   the 
General Assembly.
