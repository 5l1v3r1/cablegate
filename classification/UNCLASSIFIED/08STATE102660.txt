requests that post conducts site visits to the companies in 
order to provide Department with an assessment of their 
business operations and on-site security.  Finally, post is 
asked to assess whether the companies appear to be a reliable 
recipients of USML items.  If site visits are not possible, 
please inform the PM/DTCC officer.

proposed transaction? 
 
--Are all parties to the transaction cited on the 
authorization request? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for this USML item? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports?
