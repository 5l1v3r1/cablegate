SUBJECT: CANADA, DEMARCHE RESPONSE:  EXTERNAL EVALUATION - 
UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) 
 
REF: SECSTATE 25999 
 
Â¶1.  (U)  Econoffs spoke with Foreign Affairs Canada (FAC) 
Senior Policy Advisor for UN Specialized Agencies regarding 
funding for the external evaluation of FAO.  FAC reports that 
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has 
earmarked C$25,000 (roughly US$20,000) as an initial 
contribution, but that they are awaiting ministerial approval 
which has stalled due to the Tsunami response.  GOC is 
planning a total contribution of C$300,000 (US$242,000), with 
the bulk of that coming in the next fiscal year.  GOC points 
out that their donation will be roughly 10 percent of the 
estimated total cost of the evaluation.  At the moment, 
however, GOC is not aware of account information to which 
money for the evaluation can be sent.  Action Request: 
Please provide Post with information on where GOC can send 
their contribution.
