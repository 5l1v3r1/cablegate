¶1. Summary:  Kuwaiti daily newspapers provided coverage on 
Iraqi elections, praising the process and the peaceful 
manner in which it was carried out.  The courage of the 
people going to the polls was also praised and they were 
seen as heroes in their own right.  However Mr. Al-Ghabra, 
writing for the moderate daily Al-Rai Al-Aam, was not so 
optimistic in his view of the elections.  End Summary.

¶2. Wednesday, December 28, 2005 
 
-- Under the title "Iraq after the elections," Dr. Shafiq 
Nazem Al-Ghabra (writer and President of the American 
University of Kuwait) wrote in the moderate Arabic-language 
daily Al-Rai Al-Aam:  "The Iraqi elections gave 
contradictory results on many levels. On one level it was a 
vote for the sect to which Iraqis belong.  The Shiites voted 
for Shiites, the Sunnis voted for their parties, and the 
Kurds voted for the Kurds.  Each group voted for its own 
people and only a small few voted for a united Iraq.  This 
is evidence pointing to the current situation in Iraq that 
is based on identity and divisions.  As such, we find that 
democracy in Iraq served to divide the country and we can 
now conclude that despite the landslide victory of the 
united Shiite coalition, it will not be able to solve the 
Iraqi problem when forming the next government.  It would be 
correct to assume that the coalition will offer liberal 
Shiites and Kurds key posts in order to win over those 
protesting the results of the elections from the different 
groups.  Forming a balanced government in Iraq is now 
possible if wisdom and balancing policies were to prevail, 
and not those of crushing other groups that represent a 
major part of society during this fragile stage of building 
a new Iraq."
