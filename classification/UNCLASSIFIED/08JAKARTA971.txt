SUBJECT: DAY OF SOLIDARITY WITH CUBA--INDONESIAN RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 51536 
 
¶1. (U) The government of Indonesia does not plan to observe 
the Day of Solidarity with the Cuban People on May 21.  As 
far as we are aware, no Indonesian NGOs plan activities to 
observe the day. 
 
¶2.  (U) Mission is reviewing whether to take any actions in 
observance of the day, but has no plans at this time.  There 
is negligible awareness of issues re Cuba in Indonesia and 
there appear to be no Cuba-focused groups in Indonesia.  In 
addition, the local Cuban Embassy is not very active and 
there is not much travel between the two countries.
