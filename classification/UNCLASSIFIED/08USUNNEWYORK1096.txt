¶1. (U) The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1843 on 
November 20, authorizing a temporary increase of MONUC's 
military strength by up to 2,785 military personnel and the 
strength of its formed police unit by up to 300 personnel. 
The vote was 15-0.  France, Costa Rica, Belgium, the United 
Kingdom, and the United States sponsored the resolution. 
 
¶2. (U) Only South African PermRep Kumalo addressed the 
Council.  Kumalo said he hoped this resolution would be an 
encouragement for the political process, as the situation in 
eastern DRC was "deteriorating very fast" and the 
humanitarian situation was "dire."
