Dear Colleague 
 
CREATION OF A JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON NUCLEAR ENRERGY 
CO-OPERATION 
 
I would like to refer to a letter you received from my 
counterpart, the United States of America Secretary of State, 
Condoleezza Rice, on 23 May 2005, regarding the proposed 
creation of a Joint Standing Committee on Nuclear Energy 
Co-operation (JSCNEC) and the furtherance of the pending 
research and development co-operation agreements provided by 
the United States and submitted through a Diplomatic Note. 
 
Your Department indicated that the former Minister of 
Minerals and Energy had requested a letter to this effect 
from the United States Energy Secretary, to facilitate the 
establishment of such a committtee.  As is customary under 
diplomatic protocol in the United States, the letter was sent 
by the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, and a similar 
letter copied to me. 
 
I am keenly awaiting your guidance with regard to your 
interest in the establishment of a Joint Committeee and the 
conclusion of the two proposed agreements, as well as your 
direction pertaining to the manner in which my Department can 
be of assistance. 
 
With kind regards 
 
signed / A Pahad /
