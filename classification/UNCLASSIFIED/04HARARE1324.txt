SUBJECT: Parallel Market Over Z$10,000:US$ 
 
Ref: Harare 1319 
 
A brief update on yesterday's report (ref):  Bids topped 
$53 million for the $9.5 million on offer at Monday 
afternoon's Reserve Bank (RBZ) auction.  The immense 
unsatisfied demand is migrating quickly to the parallel 
market.  Yesterday, the RBZ shut down an exchange house 
in a Harare neighborhood where the rate ranged from 
ZS10,000-11,000:US$.  A high-level RBZ official admitted 
to us that speculative demand for US dollars at those 
rates was strong, with the expectation that Z$15,000:US$ 
is just around the corner.  The official (auction) rate 
nudged up to Z$5400:US$.  (Comment:  This is a 
significant crisis for the GOZ and RBZ.  With an iron 
fist, they are attempting to fight market dynamics and 
enforce an arbitrary exchange rate.  The overvalued rate 
will no doubt be center stage at the Confederation of 
Zimbabwe Industries' annual convention later this week.)
