¶1. In response to reftel, Post contacted Helicopter Services 
to ascertain the bona fides of the foreign end-user company 
and whether the order for 25 Pynco NVIS filtered lamp 
assemblies (P/N 2654-73P) had in fact been ordered and 
received. Helicopter Services is in fact a legitimate New 
Zealand corporation located in Taupo and has been listed with 
the New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development since 
October 1988 as a viable enterprise incorporated under the 
laws of this country. Econoff spoke with John Bates who is 
the person responsible for ordering parts at the company's 
office located at the Taupo Airport. Mr. Bates confirmed that 
the parts in question had been ordered and the shipment was 
received in December 2005. He further indicated that all 25 
pieces are currently installed in emergency medical service 
helicopters. 
 
¶2. The POC at Post for Blue Lantern issues is Econoff, Tom 
Walsh who is prepared to follow-up with Helicopter Services 
if there are more specific questions or details regarding 
this case. Contact information, phone: (64) (4) 462-6000, 
email: walshtj@state.gov.
