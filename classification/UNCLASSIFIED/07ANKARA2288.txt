In Today's Papers 
 
Parliament Debates AKP Government Program 
All papers report the Turkish Parliament debated the ruling AKP 
government's program on Monday, ahead of a vote of confidence to be 
held September 5.  Kemal Kilicdaroglu, deputy chairman of the CHP 
parliamentary group, said on behalf of his party that the program 
forgot about future goals and over-praised past practices.  "The AKP 
government failed to control the shadow economy, and they did not 
explain how the struggle against corruption will be conducted," 
Kilicdaroglu said.  He also criticized PM Erdogan for putting the 
press under pressure.  Devlet Bahceli, the leader of far-right MHP, 
said the greatest challenge Turkey faces today was "terror and 
ethnic separatism."  "Turkey has become a country of corruption, 
irregular gain, and lawlessness.  Religious beliefs should not be 
used against the republic of Turkey," Bahceli emphasized.  Main 
Kurdish party DTP leader Ahmet Turk slammed the AKP government for 
not realizing the importance of votes it received from citizens in 
eastern and southeastern Turkey. 
 
"We are seeking a solution without debating Turkey's unity," Turk 
said, "we want to contribute to a Turkey that has resolved its 
Kurdish problem, developed its democracy, established a strong 
economy and has become an example of peace and freedoms in the 
region." 
 
Prime Minister Erdogan said in defense of the program that the AKP 
votes have increased because the nation sees it as a successful 
government.  The PM urged DTP lawmakers to classify the PKK as a 
terrorist organization.  "The EU and the US accept the PKK as a 
terrorist organization, but some in this assembly do not," Erdogan 
said.  Responding to DTP claims that the votes the AKP received in 
southeast Turkey would prove "transient," Erdogan said those who 
claim this should have entered the general elections under their own 
party, referring to the fact that DTP candidates ran as independents 
in the elections. 
 
President Gul's Social Calendar 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Vatan, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others 
report that on Tuesday, newly-installed President Abdullah Gul will 
hold a reception for state officials at the presidential palace. 
The main opposition CHP said its members would not attend the 
reception.  The far-right MHP is reportedly still evaluating whether 
or not to participate.  Pro-Kurdish DTP will participate, papers 
report, whereas center-left DSP leader Zeki Sezer said he would be 
out of town and unable to attend.  Papers say Gul is to hold another 
reception at the palace for media, civic organizations, and business 
representatives September 7. 
 
Meanwhile, papers report Gul is planning to attend the UN General 
Assembly meeting in New York at the end of the month. 
 
Claims of Chemical Weapons Used against the PKK Investigated 
Milliyet, Vatan, Radikal and others report the prosecutor's office 
in Uludere in the southeastern province of Sirnak will launch an 
investigation into Kurdish party DTP's claims that Turkish military 
used chemical weapons against PKK members during an operation in the 
region August 24. 
 
US-Made Weapons Seized in Hakkari 
Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, Yeni Safak and others 
report police in Hakkari seized 30 weapons and 34 cartridges 
smuggled from Iraq during a security operation in the southeastern 
city.  Two suspects were arrested. 
 
Editorial Commentary: Turkey's Image after Presidential Election 
Sami Kohen commented in the mainstream Milliyet:  "Even though 
secularism and religious factors did not determine the result of the 
latest election, the election brought these issues to the surface 
indirectly, exhibiting a new image of Turkey.  At the moment, the 
 
ANKARA 00002288  002 OF 002 
 
 
only new thing is the headscarf of the new first lady.  However, the 
foreign press continues commenting on the new era in Turkey: seeing 
a strengthening of Islamic powers and declining secularism.  What 
will the impact of this kind of image on Turkey's foreign relations 
be?  The European public will consider this new image, with its bent 
toward an Islamic regime, rather repulsive.  However, this opinion 
changes when it comes to government policies.  Within this 
framework, Gul's presidency will not have a negative impact on the 
EU. On the contrary, the signals coming from Brussels and the other 
EU capitals reflect the governments' trust that the AKP government 
and President Gul will accelerate the EU membership process.  In 
other words, EU officials, for now at least, are not able to see the 
diminishing secularism and approaching Islamic regime in Turkey.  If 
we are not wrong in our feelings, this situation is valid for the US 
and for many other countries.  Especially for Washington, the most 
important thing is to have an administration in Ankara which will 
continue to have democracy and stability in the country, will be in 
harmony with the western world and won't cause any problems in 
bilateral relations.  The Islamic world embraces Turkey's new image 
very willingly."
