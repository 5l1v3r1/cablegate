SUBJECT: CHANGE IN POE RESTRICTIONS FOR CUBANS AT THE UN 
 
REF: 01 STATE 109933 
 
¶1.  This is a request for guidance -- see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  Reftel lists designated ports of entry for Cuban 
nationals with G-1 visas as "Entry at: New York, N.Y., 
Washington, D.C. (Dulles only), Miami and Houston." Beginning 
in January 2006, however, SAO clearance reports (applicable 
to individual Cubans applying for G-1 visas at USUN) arriving 
from CA/VO have specified POE restrictions as New York, 
Washington (Dulles only) and Miami (transit only). 
 
¶3. USUN would welcome updated instructions with any new 
guidance regarding handling of G-1 and G-4 visas for Cuban 
nationals.  Please advise.
