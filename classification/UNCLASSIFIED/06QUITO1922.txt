SUBJECT: ECUADOR WILL MAINTAIN MINUSTAH COMMITMENT 
 
REF: STATE 125442 
 
¶1.    (SBU)  PolOffs met with MFA Director General for 
Multilateral Affairs Lourdes Puma on August 2 to deliver 
reftel talking points.  Puma said the GOE will maintain its 
current support to MINUSTAH.  Puma indicated the GOE will 
fully support an extension of the MINUSTAH mandate and that 
the GOE saw the August 4 Buenos Aires meeting as addressing 
coordination rather than reviewing country levels of 
commitment.  (Note: Ecuador maintains no less than 66 troops 
as part of a combat engineering unit along the north coast of 
Haiti.) 
 
¶2.    (SBU)  Puma stressed the importance of continued 
support to the troubled nation, and said that the GOE agreed 
with the U.S. on this issue.  She asked that the U.S. do more 
to help secure additional donor funds for Haitian economic 
development.  PolOffs conveyed reftel point that the U.S. had 
pledged $210 million to help fund infrastructure, economic, 
and social development projects in Haiti, and that pledged 
support had surpassed GOH expectations for 2007.
