SUBJECT: H1N1 UPDATE: 6,062 CONFIRMED CASES 
 
REF:  A) Berlin 908, B) Berlin 906 and previous. 
 
¶1. (U)  UMMARY: The number of H1N1 infections in Germany 
rose by 738 cases to a total of 6,062 on July 31. The majority 
of new infections occurred abroad, mainly during travel to 
Spain.  Family Ministry calls on statutory health insurance 
agencies to cover costs for flu vaccination in fall.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U)  At its July 31 press briefing, the National Reference 
Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) 
announced 738 new (laboratory and non-laboratory) confirmed 
cases of H1N1.  This increases the total number of H1N1 cases 
to  6,062.   New cases were distributed among twelve federal 
states: North Rhine-Westphalia (262), Lower-Saxony (112), 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (89), Bavaria (59), Rhineland-Palatinate 
(50), Hesse (47), Hamburg (38), Berlin (34), Schleswig- 
Holstein (21), Saxony (10), Brandenburg (12) and Bremen (4). 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, the increase in the number of 
infections is mainly due to people returning from travel 
abroad (605 new cases which represents 81 percent), with most 
of the reported infections occurring while in Spain.  Newly 
confirmed cases include laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 as 
well as non-laboratory-confirmed cases, mainly from people who 
have showed symptoms after being in contact with a patient who 
has been tested positive at a labor for the new virus.  So 
far, all cases are reportedly mild. 
¶4. (U)  North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) remains the German state 
with the highest number of virus cases among all German states 
with a total of 2,446, followed by Lower-Saxony (1083) and 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (600 cases).  Less than 22 percent (1284) 
of all confirmed infections in Germany have resulted from 
domestic transmission. 
 
 
Dispute over Flu Shot Payment in Fall 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U)  The Ministry for Family Affairs has called on the 
statutory health insurance agencies to pay for the mass flu 
vaccination in fall.  Family Minister Ursula von der Leyen 
said "as long as the health insurance agencies gain a surplus 
in revenues, the money from the insurants has to be used to 
prevent an outbreak of the swine flu". "That's why we have 
health insurance", the minister said.  According to the Family 
Ministry, the health care stock has to be used for prophylaxis 
arguing that the vaccination of people will cost less than 
H1N1 treatment of people. 
 
 
Flu's Impact on Current Events 
------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (U)    Federal health authorities have taken precautionary 
measures to prepare for mass events scheduled to take place in 
Germany.  In preparation for the "Wacken Open Air", Schleswig- 
Holstein's health officials have advised visitors to abandon 
greeting rituals such as kisses to avoid a spread of the virus 
but also ensured pharmacies nearby the venue have enough 
antiviral medication on stock.  Over 75,000 visitors are 
expected to attend the event which is considered to be the 
world's largest hard rock festival and will take place July 
30-August 1, 2009.  As reported in Ref 889, the Federal 
Ministry of Health indicted that Germany will consider 
cancelling mass gatherings to stem a H1N1 outbreak if the 
virus continuous to spread further.
