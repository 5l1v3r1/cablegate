¶4.      ZAMAN: Mining companies in the areas are reportedly 
contaminating the small Eglence River in Karaisali district of

complaints are allegedly being disregarded by the authorities, 
who say they have not observed any contamination in the river. 
 
¶5.      CUMHURIYET:     Power lines were badly affected by a severe 
storm that struck Hakkari, and the whole city experienced a

the delay in restoring power in the city.
