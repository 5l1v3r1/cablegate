¶1. On October 31, we delivered reftel request to support the 
U.S. candidacy for re-election to category "A" of the 
International Maritime Organization to Montserrat Vargas of 
the MFA.  Vargas told us that although the GOCR could not 
commit to supporting the U.S. candidacy yet, she indicated 
that positive support would probably follow. 
 
¶2. Vargas added that a decision would be made shortly before 
the election.  We will follow up with Vargas.
