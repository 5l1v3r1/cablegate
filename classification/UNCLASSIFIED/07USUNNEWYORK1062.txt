UNILATERAL SANCTIONS 
 
REF: A. STATE 157045 
     ¶B. STATE 157330 
 
¶1.  Summary.  The UN General Assembly's Second Committee 
(Economic and Financial) adopted four resolutions on November 
¶16.  Per reftel instructions, the U.S. called for a vote and 
voted against resolutions on the permanent sovereignty of 
Palestinian natural resources and unilateral economic 
measures against developing countries.  The U.S. joined 
consensus on resolutions on information and communication 
technologies for development and the 2009 International Year 
of Astronomy.  Vote counts are included below.  End summary. 
 
Palestinian Resources 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. The committee first took action on resolution 
A/C.2/62/L.7/Rev.1, submitted under Agenda item 41, entitled: 
"Permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and 
of the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan over 
their natural resources."  In accordance with Ref A, the U.S. 
called for a vote and the resolution was adopted 
143-7(U.S.)-5.  The U.S. did not speak, per reftel 
instructions, but Canada explained its "no" vote by calling 
the resolution unbalanced.  Israel called the resolution "a 
disturbing reminder of the colossal gap between this body and 
results on the ground," and called on the Palestinians to 
focus more on caring for their own natural resources instead 
of fighting Israel and amongst themselves. 
 
¶3.  Portugal, speaking for the EU, stated that while they 
voted in favor of the resolution, they believe that the issue 
should be addressed in the context of the ongoing Middle East 
peace negotiations and that the resolution should not 
prejudice the outcome of those negotiations.  For its part, 
Palestine thanked member states for their support and called 
Israel's statements "baffling."  After the vote, six 
countries (El Salvador, Uganda, Peru, Belize, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, and Georgia) all explained that due to tardiness 
they had missed the vote, but had intended to vote in favor. 
The chair stated that the vote would be amended as such, but 
the secretariat later confirmed that these statements would 
be noted in the record of the meeting but the final vote 
count would not be amended. 
 
Unliateral Economic Sanctions 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4.  The committee also took action on resolution A/C.2/62/L.8 
entitled, "Unilateral economic measures as a means of 
political and economic coercion against developing 
countries," submitted under Agenda item 52 (a), Macroeconomic 
policy questions: international trade and development.  In 
accordance with Ref B, the U.S. called for a vote and the 
resolution was adopted 107-1(U.S.)-51.  Portugal, on behalf 
of the EU, explained that it chose to abstain because 
"unilateral economic measures are admissible in certain 
circumstances in particular when necessary in order to fight 
terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, or to uphold respect for human rights, 
democracy, the rule of law and good governance."  Portugal 
said the EU "is committed to using sanctions as part of an 
integrated, comprehensive policy approach."  No other 
countries spoke or referenced U.S. policy, so the U.S. did 
not deliver any remarks, per reftel instructions. 
 
ICT for Development and the 
International Year of Astronomy 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  The committee adopted two more resolutions by consensus: 
A/C.2/62/L.35, submitted under Agenda item 51, entitled: 
"Information and communication technologies for development," 
and A/C.2/62/L.36, entitled: "International Year of 
Astronomy, 2009."  The latter, originating from an earlier 
decision by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization, was submitted under Agenda item 56 
(b), Globalization and interdependence: science and 
technology for development.
