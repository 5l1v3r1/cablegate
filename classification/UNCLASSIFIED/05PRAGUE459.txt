REF: SECSTATE 56724 
 
We delivered reftel demarche to Hana Sevcikova, Head of 
Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Assistance at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  She told us that there is no 
likelihood of a Czech financial pledge at the Oslo conference 
on Darfur April 12.  She said the Czech Republic has already 
given 10 million crowns ($435,000) for the peace process, 
which is the largest sum of any of the new EU member states. 
She added that the Czech Republic has already spent a lot of 
money on tsunami relief this year.  She did agree that the 
Czech ambassador will support the political goals of the 
conference and appreciated having the talking points from 
reftel.  A new financial contribution would require a higher 
political decision, for which she did not hold out much hope.
