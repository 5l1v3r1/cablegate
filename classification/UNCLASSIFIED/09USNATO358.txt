Press Release: (2009) 119 
 
Statement by the NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh 
Rasmussen, on the terrorist attacks in Baghdad 
 
On behalf of NATO, I condemn in the strongest possible terms 
the terrorist attacks in Baghdad today.  I would like to 
express NATO's sincere condolences to the Iraqi government, 
the Iraqi people and to the families and loved ones of the 
victims of these bloody attacks.  This tragic loss of life 
and suffering underscore, yet again, the grave danger the 
terrorist threat poses to all of us. 
 
There can be no justification for such cowardly and pointless 
attacks.  NATO will continue to work with Iraq in training 
the Iraqi security forces and to cooperate in the fight 
against the scourge of terrorism.
