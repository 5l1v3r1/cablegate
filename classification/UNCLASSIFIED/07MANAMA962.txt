1.(U) Pol/Econ Chief delivered reftel points on country-specific and thematic resolutions to Aisha Al-Khalifa of the MFA international organizations directorate on October 18. She received the points without substantive comment.

2.(SBU) IO Special Representative for Social Affairs Ambassador Joseph Rees discussed the resolution on rape as an instrument of state policy with MFA Undersecretary for Coordination and Follow Up Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa and MFA Deputy Director for International Organizations Khadim Al-Arrayedh during his visit to Manama in September. At that time, both Al-Khalifa and Al-Arrayedh expressed support for the idea in general terms, but noted that they would need to review a copy of the draft text before committing to support the resolution. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI
