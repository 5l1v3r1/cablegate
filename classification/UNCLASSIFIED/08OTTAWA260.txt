On February 14 Embassy delivered reftel points to the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (Don 
MacPhee, Senior Advisor, International Health); Health Canada 
(Gloria Wiseman, Director, International Affairs) and Canada 
Border Services Agency (Sara Wiebe, Director, U.S., Cabinet 
and Portfolio Affairs) asking for Canada's support in 
sponsoring the proposal to be discussed in Lima on February 
21-22.  Late on February 20, MacPhee and Wiseman told Embassy 
the proposal seems to be in line with Canada's objectives for 
the IHRs and the APEC region.  They did not offer definitive 
support, but said Health Canada Director General for 
International Affairs Bersebel Ephrem would discuss the issue 
further with USG colleagues in Lima.
