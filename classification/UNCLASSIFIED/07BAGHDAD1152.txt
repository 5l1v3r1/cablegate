SUBJECT: PRT TIKRIT: PROVINCIAL BUDGET HAS MULTIPLYING 
EFFECT ON GOVERNANCE, PC HOLDS PRESS CONFERENCE 
 
¶1. (U) This is a PRT Tikrit, Salah ad Din cable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY.  At an April 2 PRT/Coalition 
Forces-initiated press conference, the Salah ad Din 
Provincial Council (PC) Chair Sheikh Rasheed Ossman and key 
PC members outlined the 2007 provincial budget and fielded 
questions from members of the local media, including Salah ad 
Din Television (reftel).  During the press conference, Sheikh 
Rasheed gave a thorough overview of the 2007 budget, compared 
the current budget to the 2006 budget, discussed the PC's 
oversight role in the budget execution process, and answered 
questions. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Sheikh Rasheed concluded the press conference by 
calling the press "the power of truth" and encouraging them 
to attend PC meetings and other legislative committee 
meetings.  The Governor and Deputy Governor plan to hold a 
second press conference about the budget execution process 
later in the week.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) This was the first press conference the Salah ad Din 
Provincial Council has sponsored and marks a significant 
change in the way Sheikh Rasheed and other PC members view 
the media.  Previously, the media had been barred from 
attending PC meetings and arbitrarily banned from reporting 
on certain topics.  The PC's pride in passing a professional 
provincial budget is proving to have a multiplying effect in 
many governance areas: improving relations with the media, a 
renewed desire to ensure proper checks and balances in 
project contracting, and a vision for automating the 
provincial accounting records.  END COMMENT.
