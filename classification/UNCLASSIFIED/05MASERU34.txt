¶1.  Ministry of Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Motlatsi 
Ramafole informed post January 20 that Lesotho's delegation to 
the AU Summit in Abuja, Nigeria would be as follows:  Deputy 
Prime Minister Archibald Lesao Lehohla, Minister of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) Monyane Moleleki, MFA Deputy Principal Secretary 
¶T. P. Lekhela and Ambassador M. Leteka, GOL Ambassador to the AU 
(also accredited to Nigeria). 
 
¶2.  Post recommends that PDAS Ranneberger have a meeting (or, at 
minimum, a pull aside) with the DPM and with MFA.  The new MFA 
is up to date on U.S. positions regarding regional issues (such 
as elections) as well as broader issues in our bilateral 
relationship. 
 
¶3.  Suggested Talking Points: 
 
-- We appreciate Lesotho's active role in the SADC Troika and 
growing role in the AU. 
 
-- Your national elections (2002) were free and fair; we are 
encouraged by your commitment to have successful local 
government elections in April.  (Note:  These will be Lesotho's 
first local government elections.) 
 
-- We encourage Lesotho to play an active role in sharing your 
good record with Zimbabwe.  In that regard, we urge you to 
encourage Zimbabwe to follow SADC guidelines as its March 
election approaches. 
 
-- We appreciate the strong relationship the U.S. has with 
Lesotho in strengthening democracy through dialogue and 
training; sponsoring the upcoming U.S./Lesotho Trade Delegation; 
and increasing U.S. funding to fight HIV/AIDS in your country 
(30-40% infection rate).
