¶2.  German Foreign Ministry (MFA) and German 
Development Ministry (BMZ) both reported that 
Germany plans to continue its support for the 
MINUSTAH Mission.  A BMZ official noted that 
?following difficulties in the beginning, the 
Mission now operates successfully? adding that 
the Mission provides ?a framework of security for 
development programs and contributes to the 
stabilization of Haiti?.  The MFA stressed that 
Germany was in a continuing dialogue regarding 
MINUSTAH and supported the renewal of its 
mandate. 
 
¶3.  Germany currently contributes 9 percent to 
the cost of MINUSTAH and has provided a total of 
USD 48 million to the effort. Annual bilateral 
development assistance to Haiti amounts to 3 
million Euro which is spent on eradication of 
poverty and basic educational training. In 
addition, Germany contributes 20 percent to the 
EU?s development efforts and debt relief programs 
in the ACP countries.  Germany is also active in 
a regional Caribbean initiative to counter 
climate change and is a major contributor to the 
fight against HIV/AIDS-Tuberculosis in the 
region.  Germany is currently reviewing its 
development assistance to the Caribbean as part 
of the Paris round of donor harmonization. 
 
¶4.  The MFA told Embassy that it would send a 
representative to the September 26 New York 
meeting of the Haiti key player nations.  The 
German Ambassador to the U.S. will most likely 
represent MF State Secretary Reinhard Silberberg 
at the meeting.
