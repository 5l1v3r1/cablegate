SUBJECT: MARCH 4 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: PENTAGON REPORT ON PRC 
MILITARY, IRAN SANCTIONS, SIX-PARTY TALKS, U.S.-CHINA MILITARY 
HOTLINE, PLA BUDGET, RUSSIA, JAPAN DUMPLING CASE 
 
¶1. Key points at the March 4, 2008 MFA Press Briefing were: 
 
-- China dismissed the Pentagon report on the Chinese military as "a 
serious distortion of facts" and accused the United States of 
adopting a "Cold War mentality." 
 
-- China does not encourage Chinese hackers to launch cyber-attacks 
on U.S. networks. 
 
-- China supported UN Security Council Resolution 1803 on Iran "not 
to punish" Tehran but to facilitate negotiations.  The sanctions 
will not affect China-Iran trade. 
 
-- Communications between any of the Six-Party states has not been 
cut-off and remain "favorable." 
 
-- China is looking forward to working with Russian President 
Medvedev to move bilateral relations to a "new stage." 
 
China is "Ready to Work" with Russia 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. During the March 4 regular MFA press briefing, spokesperson Qin 
Gang began by saying China believes under the leadership of 
President Medvedev Russia will attain "even greater achievements." 
Qin said China is ready to work with Russia to promote their 
strategic partnership and move bilateral relations to a "new 
stage." 
 
Annual Pentagon Report on PRC Military 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. When asked to comment on the recently released annual Department 
of Defense report to Congress on the Chinese military, Qin said the 
Chinese Government is "resolutely against it" and characterized the 
report as "a serious distortion of facts."  Qin said the report 
attempts to "interfere in China's internal affairs" and the United 
States should "drop the Cold War mentality" as well as "stop sending 
weapons to Taiwan." 
 
¶4. When asked whether the Chinese Government and the People's 
Liberation Army (PLA) encourage Chinese civilians to hack into U.S. 
networks like the Pentagon, Qin dismissed the claim as "groundless." 
 "I assure you China would never do that kind of thing," he stated. 
 
PLA Budget Growth 
----------------- 
 
¶5. Qin said the PLA's budget is "in line with China's national 
development."  China is pursuing a path of peaceful development, 
promotes regional stability and is not a threat.  China is opposed 
to "some countries' advocacy" of a "so-called China threat" because 
it interferes with China's internal affairs and is not good for 
bilateral relations. 
 
U.S.-China Military Hotline 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6. When asked who in the Chinese Government would be responsible for 
answering the U.S.-China military hotline, Qin said "who" is not 
important, but "mentality" is.  If people do not drop their "Cold 
War mentality," hotlines will not help.  China hopes to continue 
building stronger U.S.-China military cooperation and mutual trust. 
When asked when the U.S.-China military hotline would become 
operational, Qin sad this was still being discussed. 
UN Security Council Sanctions on Iran 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶7. Qin said China believes the purpose of UN Security Council 
Resolution 1803 on Iran is not to punish Tehran but to activate a 
new round of diplomatic negotiations.  China hopes Iran will "take 
this seriously."  In response to a question on the sanction's impact 
on China-Iran trade, Qin said bilateral trade relations have nothing 
to do with Iran's nuclear programs or the UNSC resolution and will 
not be affected. 
 
Six-Party Talks 
--------------- 
 
¶8. When asked about China's plans to arrange discussions between the 
United States and North Korea last week, Qin confirmed that 
Assistant Secretary Christopher Hill and Vice Foreign Minister Wu 
Dawei met on March 1 to discuss the Six-Party Talks.  Qin said that 
all parties have maintained communication and consultations in 
various forms.  He said communications have not been cut-off amongst 
any of the parties and remain "favorable." 
 
China-Japan Dumpling Issue, Hu's Visit Not Postponed 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 
¶9. Qin said China is approaching the poisoned dumpling investigation 
with a "highly responsible attitude."  The investigation will be 
properly handled through bilateral cooperation.  China urges all 
parties involved to stay "objective and rational" and respect 
"scientific and objective" conclusions.  Qin said President Hu's 
planned visit to Japan has not been postponed.
