 Reftel talking points were delivered to the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Subdirector General for Multilateral Economic 
Relations Pablo Montesino-Espartero on July 1, 2005. 
Montesino informed Econoff on July 7 that the talking points 
were forwarded to Spain's Mission to the OECD for comment. 
Montesino suggested that the US Mission to the OECD confer 
directly with the GOS Mission to the OECD in order to obtain 
a timely response.
