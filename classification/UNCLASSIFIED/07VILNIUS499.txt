We delivered reftel points to Martynas Lukosevicius, attache 
in the MFA's Arms Control, Non-proliferation, and Disarmament 
Division, on July 2.  He said he would share our points with 
relevant institutions.  He added that he did not think the 
GOL had any additional information, but would provide us with 
it, if he found any.
