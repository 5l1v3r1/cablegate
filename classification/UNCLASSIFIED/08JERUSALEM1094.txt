The effects of the closure of Gaza border crossings attract front 
page coverage in the three dailies.  Papers report that commercial 
crossings were closed by Israel on June 24 in response to a rocket 
attack by Islamic Jihad.  The closure will prevent the entry of 
goods and fuel, just one day after Israel had allowed for an 
increase of goods into Gaza, reporting notes.  Al Quds highlights 
that Gazans needing urgent medical care were allowed to cross into 
Egypt through the Rafah crossing point, in accordance with the truce 
agreement.  The paper also reports that Hamas is refuting Israeli 
claims that Egypt has linked greater opening of the Rafah crossing 
point to the release of Israeli soldier Shalit.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
adds that Hamas says that it will not back down from its 
preconditions for release of Shalit. 
 
Front pages report that Hamas has asked Egypt to intervene with 
relevant parties to ensure the continuation of the Hamas/Israel 
truce in the Gaza Strip.  According to coverage, Islamic Jihad told 
AFP that the group intends to honor the truce, "as long as Israel 
does not violate it."  In related news, front pages report on the 
formation of a crisis cell by Hamas in Gaza to follow issues related 
to the truce.  The new entity will monitor Israeli violations and 
includes representatives of all Palestinian factions, according to 
the dailies. 
 
In a statement released to the press, Palestinian Authority 
President Mahmud Abbas emphasized his commitment to internal 
reconciliation talks and stressed that he will not allow any 
regional or international party to "veto" the talks that seek to 
unite Palestinian factions.  Abbas continued that, "as soon as the 
Hamas movement commits itself to national legitimacy and the 
national program, no obstacles to solidarity will remain," the three 
dailies report.  In related news, Al-Quds reports that Hamas denies 
any internal division within its movement. 
 
All dailies report that Egyptian security forces have uncovered 
seven tunnels along its border with the Gaza Strip.  The tunnels 
were used for smuggling and pumping fuel into Gaza, the papers say. 
Front pages also highlight that an Egyptian official confirmed that 
11 packs of marijuana were also found. 
 
The daily media reporting on Israeli incursions and arrests includes 
a report by WAFA News Agency that Israeli Defense Forces "invaded" 
Janin and Qabatya cities in the northern West Bank on June 26, but 
made no arrests.  The news agency also reports that Nablus city and 
nearby Ayn Bayt al-Ma' refugee camp were "invaded" and two youths 
arrested.  Al- Ayyam's front page briefly reports on clashes in the 
West Bank town of Taqu'a near Bethlehem between Israeli soldiers and 
Palestinians.  The paper also notes the arrest by Israelis of a 
Palestinian in the West Bank city of Hebron.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1.  Al- Quds prints its daily editorial entitled, "Jerusalem, the 
capital of the Palestinian State, not American merchandise" (6/26): 
We were truly shocked by [Barak Obama's] statement about Jerusalem, 
and by his assertion that Jerusalem will remain the capital of 
Israel and should remain undivided...  With this [Obama] declared 
war on the Arab Palestinian people's right to self-determination and 
the right of Muslims and Arabs all over the world [to the Arabic 
 
JERUSALEM 00001094  002 OF 002 
 
 
heritage of] Jerusalem... naturally, [Obama's] statement was met 
with denunciations and resentment from all Arab and Islamic 
quarters, which led Obama to make a new statement explaining that 
Jerusalem is an issue for both parties of the conflict to resolve... 
Without the resentment conveyed to Obama about his first statements, 
he would not have been forced to back down on his harsh first 
statement... this retreat...shows that Arabs and Muslims are capable 
of achieving victory ...if they unite over the Jerusalem cause.  And 
they are capable of forcing Israel's allies...to swallow their 
imbalanced statements... 
 
¶2.  Independent Al-Ayyam carries an op-ed- by Dr. Abdul Majid 
Swaylim entitled, "Sarkozy, the temporary friend of both sides" 
(6/26):  Sarkozy knows that the whole Arab and Islamic world might 
extend diplomatic relations to Israel if [Israel] gives up on 
expansion, aggression, isolation and its separation policy... At the 
Knesset, Sarkozy reiterated his special friendship with 
Israel,...but he also sent us a new message of friendship when he 
talked about all or at least some of our rights.  What is important 
to us is that Sarkozy, who was brave in his attitudes, will 
translate his words into action... to push Europe to play a dynamic 
role of pressuring [Israel] to move towards peace.  We also expect, 
whether old McCain or black Obama moves  into the White House, that 
[Sarkozy] will pursue his own [not America's] policies ...President 
Sarkozy cannot be a permanent friend neither to us nor to Israel 
because Israel will soon find out that Sarkozy is not a, 'suitable' 
friend if he insists on these positions...  However, if he deserts 
his brave attitudes that support our rights, we will not regret the 
short friendship...
