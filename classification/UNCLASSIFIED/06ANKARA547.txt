SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT 
WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2006 
 
 
In Today's Papers 
 
Cartoon Crisis 
All papers:  Violent protests continue all around the world 
over the political cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed. 
Turkish PM Erdogan sent letters to 80 world leaders urging 
them to protect sacred values from insults but also to show 
restraint, adding that violence cannot be justified. 
Italian PM Berlusconi and US Assistant Secretary of State 
Daniel Fried extended support for the joint statement issued 
Monday by the Prime Ministers of Turkey and Spain in an 
effort to ease the tension.  Responding to questions after 
his meeting with the Chairman of the Union of Chambers and 
Commodity Exchanges (TOBB), US Ambassador to Turkey Ross 
Wilson was quoted as saying that "publishing cartoons of the 
prophet Mohammed was an ugly act; however, responding to 
different opinions with violence is very wrong, too." 
 
Commenting in the mainstream daily Milliyet, Sami Kohen 
writes that the crisis has broadened the gap between the 
Islamic world and the West and has helped "resurrect" the 
hate and rage of the past in the Islamic world toward the 
Western world.  Kohen states that despite the religions 
origins of the crisis, there are political, ideological and 
cultural factors as well, concluding that, "anyone sensible 
in both the Islamic and the Western world is aware of the 
fact that this crisis must be settled before it grows even 
more." 
 
Iran Reacts to the Cartoon Crisis; Nuclear Pressure 
Hurriyet, Vatan, Milliyet:  In reaction to cartoons 
depicting Mohammed, Iran retaliated by announcing a 
holocaust cartoon contest.  Iranian newspaper Hamshahri 
decided to launch a contest for cartoons on the holocaust to 
test whether the west will apply the principle of freedom of 
expression to the Nazi genocide in the same way that it is 
applied to the Mohammed cartoons.  Iran also announced 
yesterday the suspension of all trade and economic ties with 
Denmark, and banned Danish products from entering the 
country. 
 
Cumhuriyet and Turkish Daily News reported that Iran has 
asked the International Atomic Energy Agency to remove their 
surveillance equipment from its nuclear facilities by mid 
February. 
 
Priest Murder Suspect Captured 
All papers:  A 16-year-old high school student was detained 
yesterday as the suspected murderer of an Italian priest in 
Turkey's Black Sea province of Trabzon.  The suspect 
reportedly said that he was disturbed by the cartoons of 
Mohammed published by the western media. Although the 
interrogation of the suspect continues, most papers believe 
that the murder was linked to the cartoon crises. 
 
US-Turkey Rice Dispute 
Sabah, Vatan:  US Trade Representative Rob Portman requested 
that the World Trade Organization appoint a dispute 
settlement panel to hear US allegations against Turkey for 
restricting imports of US rice.  Portman stressed that 
American farmers were being denied access to Turkey's rice 
market because of Turkey's unfair import restrictions.  "We 
still hope that a solution can be reached and that Turkey 
will allow US producers to compete fairly in the Turkish 
market, Portman said. 
 
US Budget Proposal: Increase for Defense, Cuts to VOA 
Radikal, Milliyet:  Among proposals in President Bush's 
draft US budget for 2007 was the elimination of Turkish 
 
ANKARA 00000547  002 OF 002 
 
 
broadcasting of the Voice of America (VOA).  If the budget 
is approved, starting from October 1, VOA's 12-hour weekly 
radio broadcasts, half-hour TV broadcasts and the Turkish 
Internet page will be eliminated.  Moreover, 14 VOA Turkish 
service staff members in Washington and other staff 
overseas, including those in Istanbul and Ankara, will be 
lose their jobs.  VOA officials stated that the reason for 
this decision is the need for additional spending on other 
areas such as the Iraq war and reconstruction of the areas 
hit by Hurricane Katerina.  Meanwhile, the White House, 
after decreasing education and health expenses, requested a 
6.9 percent increase for the Pentagon in its draft budget 
for 2007.  If the Congress approves the budget, military 
spending will have increased 48 percent since 2001.
