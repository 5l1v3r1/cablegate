SUBJECT: PERU'S EXPORTS OF GOODS SURGE 36 PERCENT IN 2006 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  On January 23, Trade Minister Araoz presented the GOP's 
official export statistics for 2006.  Peruvian exports 
totaled USD 23.431 billion (all figures are FOB), 35.6 higher 
than in 2005, and accounted for just over a quarter of Peru's 
GDP.  Exports were the biggest contributors to Peru's 
impressive 7.7 percent GDP growth in 2006 (Central Bank 
figure).  The U.S. market share of Peru's exports dropped 
from 31 percent in 2005 to 23 percent in 2006.  Some Peruvian 
officials blame the slowdown in export growth to the U.S. 
(only 2.5 percent in 2006) on the uncertainty surrounding the 
extension of Andean trade preferences (ATPDEA) and approval 
of the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) by the U.S. 
Congress, though many other factors also contributed (market 
prices, increased competition from CAFTA and China, etc.). 
 
¶2.  After posting a record month in December, Peru has had 58 
consecutive months of export growth.  Helped by strong 
prices, mined metals continued their dominance in 2006, 
accounting for 62 percent of Peru's exports.  The vast 
majority of Peru's exporters are micro or small enterprises 
(e.g. 90 percent of textile exporters and 82 percent of 
agricultural exporters).  The Exporters' Association (ADEX) 
predicts a 15 percent increase in Peru's export of goods in 
2007, and the Trade Ministry has set a target of USD 27 
billion.  The above figures do not include Peru's exports in 
services, which totaled USD 2.4 billion in 2006.  End Summary. 
 
SELLING MORE TO MORE MARKETS 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3.  The twelve countries receiving the largest share of 
Peru's exported goods are listed in the table below.  The 
U.S. remained Peru's top export market by far, receiving 23.3 
percent of Peru's exports (USD 5.468 billion).  However, 
exports to the U.S. increased by only 2.5 percent (USD 134.1 
million) in 2006, compared with 43.8 percent in 2005, when 
the U.S. received 30.9 percent of Peru's exports.  Some 
Peruvian officials blame the slowdown in export growth to the 
U.S. on the uncertainty surrounding the extension of Andean 
trade preferences (ATPDEA) and approval of the U.S.-Peru 
Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) by the U.S. Congress, though 
many other factors also contributed (market prices, increased 
competition from CAFTA and China, etc.). 
 
¶4.  Peru's exports to China increased by 21 percent, and 
virtually all of third-place Switzerland's imports were gold. 
 The countries receiving the largest percentage increase in 
exports from Peru were:  Ukraine (3,062%, total USD 38.8 
million), North Korea (2,296%, USD 23 million), Bangladesh 
(1,547%, USD 4.5 million), Congo (1,275%, USD 4.5 million), 
and the Philippines (551%, USD 4.5 million).  In 2006, Peru 
exported to seven new markets -- Oman, Monaco, Macedonia, 
Solomon Islands, Ivory Coast, British Indian Ocean Territory, 
and Nauru -- bringing the total markets for Peruvian goods to 
¶181.

LEADING SECTORS ARE STILL 
MINING, PETROLEUM AND AGRICULTURE 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  The eight sectors that accounted for approximately 98 
percent of Peru's exports are listed in the table below. 
Helped by strong prices, mined metals continued their 
dominance in 2006, accounting for 62 percent of Peru's 
exports.  Non-traditional crops boosted agricultural exports 
by 33 percent compared with 2005, and iron/steel exports 
increased 86 percent. 
 
Peru's Top 8 Export Sectors (2006) 
Sector : Value (USD million) : % Change'05 : % of Total'06 
1)mined metals : $14,465 : 48% : 62% 
2)petroleum/derivatives : $1,793 : 13% : 8% 
3)agriculture : $1,783 : 33% : 8% 
4)fishing : $1,770 : 8% : 8% 
5)textiles : $1,468 : 15% : 6% 
6)iron/steel/metallurgy : $718 : 86% : 3% 
7)chemicals : $597 : 12% : 3% 
8)wood/paper : $332 : 27% : 1% 
 
MINING: COPPER AND ZINC LEAD GROWTH 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  The value of the dominant metal mining sector's exports 
increased by 48.2 percent in 2006 to USD 14.465 billion. 
Copper exports totaled USD 6.034 billion (up 76.5%), gold 
totaled USD 3.952 billion (27.7% increase), Zinc totaled USD 
1.991 billion (147.3% increase), and Molybdenum accounted for 
USD 862 million (a 25% decrease).  Non-metallic mining 
exports (not included in "mined metals" above) increased by 
14.2 percent in 2006 to USD 135 million.  The mining sector 
should maintain its dominance in 2007, as prices show no 
signs of dropping. 
 
PETROLEUM AND DERIVATIVES: MORE OIL ON THE WAY 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶7.  Petroleum derivatives totaled USD 1.305 billion, a 7 
percent decrease compared with 2005.  However, crude exports 
rose 161.2 percent to USD 488 million, and should continue to 
rise in the future due to new exploration and extraction. 
 
AGRICULTURE: CROP DIVERSITY INCREASING 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  The agricultural sector exported USD 1.783 billion in 
2006, 33 percent more than in 2005, with the top markets 
being the U.S. (35 percent), Spain (13 percent), the 
Netherlands (8 percent), France (5 percent), the UK (5 
percent), Ecuador (5 percent), and Colombia (3 percent).  As 
a combined grouping, the European Union received 40 percent 
of Peru's agricultural exports.  Prominent traditional 
exports included coffee (grew by 68 percent to USD 514 
million) and sugar (USD 43 million).  Non-traditional 
agricultural exports were led by asparagus, paprika and 
artichokes (see table below).  82 percent of agricultural 
exporters were micro or small enterprises.  The impressive 
growth in agricultural exports should continue in 2007 as 
more and more farmers switch to higher-value crops with GOP 
and international assistance and these products enter more 
markets. 
 
Peru's Top 10 Non-Traditional Agricultural Exports (2006) 
Product : Value (USD million) : % Change'05 
1)asparagus : $291 : 18% 
2)paprika : $73 : -23% 
3)artichokes : $65 : 48% 
4)fresh mangoes : $59 : 55% 
5)evaporated milk : $51 : 29% 
6)fresh peppers : $50 : 39%  (export to U.S. not permitted) 
7)grapes : $48 : 41% 
8)avocados : $39 : 67% 
9)shrimp feed : $34 : 26% 
10)bananas : $27 : 52% 
 
FISHING: MORE FISH AND SQUID 
---------------------------- 
 
¶9.  Traditional exports of fishmeal (USD 1.135 billion) and 
fish oil (USD 196 million) comprised the bulk of fishing 
exports.  But non-traditional fishing exports grew an 
impressive 33 percent, led by mackerel (631% growth), yellow 
jacks (544%), and squid (which increased 21% to USD 148 
million). 
 
TEXTILES: UNCERTAINTY HURTS SHIPMENTS TO U.S. 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  Despite a slowdown in some categories of textile exports 
to the U.S., total textile exports grew by 15 percent (to USD 
1.468 billion).  Peru's top textile markets were:  USA (59%), 
Venezuela (12%), Chile (3%), and Colombia (3%).  Ninety 
percent of textile exporters were micro or small businesses. 
 
FOCUS ON SERVICES INCREASING 
---------------------------- 
 
¶11.  Taken together, exports in services totaled USD 2.4 
billion in 2006.  About half of this total was travel, and 
USD 20 million was in software.  The GOP announced plans to 
support the expansion of exports in elective health, ship 
repair, software, franchising, and call centers.  The 
Exporters' Association (ADEX) predicts 10 percent growth in 
services exports in 2007. 
 
MORE EXPORTERS, BUT HIGH FAILURE RATE 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶12.  According to GOP figures, 6,440 companies exported at 
least USD 2,000 worth of goods in 2006 (compared with 5,452 
in 2005 and 3,883 in 2001).  Of these, 806 companies exported 
over USD 1 million each.  There were 2,025 new exporters in 
¶2006.  The vast majority of Peru's exporters are micro or 
small enterprises (e.g. 90 percent of textile exporters and 
82 percent of agricultural exporters). 
 
¶13.  GOP officials were puzzled by the high rate of business 
failure in the export sector.  About one-third of exporting 
companies cease to export the following year, and 63 percent 
have ceased by the fourth year.  The GOP would like to reduce 
this costly rate of abandonment, and plans to provide market 
intelligence training to targeted audiences in 2007. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶14.  Peru's exports have more than tripled since 2002, when 
the U.S. Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act 
(ATPDEA) expanded Andean trade preferences.  These years of 
rapid trade expansion and of free trade agreement 
negotiations with the United States have brought exports to 
the forefront in Peru, and many Peruvian businesses continue 
to join the exporting ranks.  The Garcia Administration 
recognizes the fundamental importance of exports to economic 
growth, job creation, and poverty reduction.  While approval 
by the U.S. Congress of the PTPA remains the GOP's top trade 
priority, GOP ministries and the private sector are actively 
engaged in further opening other markets for Peruvian 
products.  Trade negotiations are underway with the EU, 
Mexico and several Southeast Asian countries.  The GOP's 
preparations to host APEC in 2008 include an important push 
to secure trade deals with new partners.
