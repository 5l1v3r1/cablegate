SUMMARY 
------- 
 
(U) The overall nutrition situation across Darfur remains relatively 
stable in the approach to the rainy season, with most indicators in 
line with seasonal trends, according to the UN Children's Fund 
(UNICEF). However, worrisome mortality rates, pockets of high global 
acute malnutrition, and limited humanitarian presence in some areas 
of displacement reflect the continued need to address the underlying 
causes of malnutrition through water, sanitation, and hygiene 
interventions, as well as programs targeting child care practices. 
End summary. 
 
-------- 
OVERVIEW 
-------- 
 
¶1. (U) Available indicators on malnutrition, including new 
admissions to feeding centers, food security levels, and sentinel 
site data, indicate a generally stable nutrition situation in Darfur 
as compared to the same time last year. Exceptions include areas in 
South Darfur currently receiving newly internally displaced persons 
(IDPs), Kalma IDP camp, and Kabkabiya town. 
 
¶2. (U) At the approach of the rainy season and the start of the 
hunger gap, relief agencies reported 5,039 new admissions to 
supplementary feeding centers (SFCs) across Darfur in March and 
April, up from 3,262 in January and February. Admissions to 
therapeutic feeding centers (TFCs) more than doubled over the same 
period, from 593 to 1,233.  South and West Darfur account for the 
largest increases in admissions. UNICEF notes that these figures are 
consistent with reports during the same period in 2006. At a June 7 
nutrition coordination meeting in Khartoum, non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) reported that May admissions reflect expected 
seasonal trends. Mean weight-height scores gathered at sentinel 
sites indicate the anticipated slight deterioration in nutritional 
status that occurs at the start of the hunger season. 
 
¶3. (U) Localized nutrition surveys in March through May reveal 
global acute malnutrition (GAM) at or exceeding emergency thresholds 
in areas of recent displacement in South Darfur. In addition, UNICEF 
notes that crude mortality rates at or above alert levels in three 
out of four localized surveys covering portions of South and West 
Darfur are potentially of concern. UN agencies and NGOs emphasize 
the need to address underlying causes of malnutrition, such as 
overall health and access to safe drinking water, through water, 
sanitation, and hygiene interventions and infant and young child 
feeding and care programs. 
 
------------ 
SOUTH DARFUR 
------------ 
 
¶4. (U) Following poor harvests in 2006 and tribal clashes that led 
to new displacements, seasonal malnutrition in South Darfur appears 
to have started in March rather than April or May.  Data available 
indicates increased malnutrition appears "normal" relative to 
seasonal levels of chronic malnutrition in Darfur. There is no 
statistically significant difference in malnutrition rates between 
resident and displaced communities. However, many areas witnessing 
recent displacement, such as Buram, Ed el Fursan, and southern 
Tulus, have limited or no NGO presence, resulting in limited data. 
 
¶5. (U) Since March 2007, two rapid assessments and four surveys have 
been conducted in both IDP and mixed-IDP and resident-populated 
areas in South Darfur. Most survey results indicate GAM rates below 
the 15 percent emergency threshold and within expected seasonal 
ranges. Nyala town and surrounding IDP camps, minus Al Salam, Otash, 
and Kalma, report GAM of 11.8 percent.  Results from Kubum and Tulus 
are 8.4 percent and 14.1 percent GAM, respectively. 
 
¶6. (U) Rapid assessments in Kalma and Ed Daien indicate emergency 
levels of malnutrition and should be monitored closely.  The 
nutrition situation in Al Salam camp constitutes a new emergency 
with the arrival of more than 6,000 new IDPs in May, and an 
estimated 10,000 arrivals to date in June, many of whom are in poor 
health. Based on preliminary results from USAID-partner Action 
Contre la Faim (ACF) in late May, GAM is 23.3 percent with 2.8 
percent severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Efforts to stabilize this

population include hygiene promotion, construction of new latrines, 
an expanded outpatient therapeutic program for severely malnourished 
persons, and increased access to water. 
 
----------- 
WEST DARFUR 
----------- 
 
¶7. (U) UNICEF reports that admissions to SFCs remain highest in West 
Darfur, possibly owing to population movement, seasonal illness, and 
different numbers of SFCs in each state. The higher admission 
numbers may also stem from the proportionally higher number of 
reported bloody diarrhea cases in the state. 
 
¶8. (U) Results from localized surveys and sentinel site data in West 
Darfur point to the need for expanded water, sanitation, and hygiene 
interventions to prevent and treat illnesses such as diarrhea and 
malaria. Sentinel site data from March and April indicate that the 
majority of children under five reported an illness in the previous 
two weeks, and a localized nutrition survey in For Baranga in 
February revealed a crude mortality rate above alert levels at 1.21 
percent. 
 
¶9. (U) A rapid assessment of new IDP and refugee arrivals in Kenyu, 
Ramakai, and Koronga in For Baranga locality in May, by USAID 
partner Save the Children/US, found malnutrition rates below 
emergency levels. However, information on average weight gain and 
length of stay in therapeutic feeding programs indicates that many 
children are recovering slowly, likely due to families sharing the 
rations among family members beyond the targeted child. Insecurity 
also leads to particularly high defaulter rates in some localities, 
posing an additional challenge to recovery. 
 
------------ 
NORTH DARFUR 
------------ 
 
¶10. (U) Nutrition survey results, low enrollment in feeding centers, 
and sentinel site data indicate a generally stable nutrition 
situation in North Darfur.  However, humanitarian assessments of IDP 
camps and rural areas in April and May recommend close monitoring 
and nutritional screening of new arrivals. A survey conducted in 
Kabkabiya at the peak of seasonal malnutrition in June revealed 27 
percent GAM and 1.9 percent SAM. Insecurity, including carjackings 
and attacks on NGOs, continues to hamper nutrition programs in North 
Darfur. 
 
¶11. (U) In North Darfur, both UN and NGO staff attribute 
malnutrition to poor diet, hygiene, and sanitation, not to food 
availability or accessibility. UN agencies and the State Ministry of 
Health continue to recommend refresher training for nutrition staff 
and emphasize health promotion to combat malnutrition.  USAID field 
staff note that NGOs are assessing SFC and TFC admission criteria to 
correct any artificially low criteria. 
 
-------- 
COMMENTS 
-------- 
 
¶12. (U) Gaps in available nutrition data persist from insecurity 
hampering access as well as NGO presence largely based in areas of 
greatest concern in 2004 and 2005. New displacement within South 
Darfur and movement of IDPs from Mukjar, Zalingei, and Dafak has 
created a need for additional nutrition surveillance in currently 
underserved areas.
