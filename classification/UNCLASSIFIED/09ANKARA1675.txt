Media Highlights 
 
Anti Turkey President for EU (Cumhuriyet): Turkish media unanimously 
decry the EU's election of "anti-Turkey" Herman van Rompuy for its 
top job and wonder what it means for Turkey's EU aspirations.  In a 
banner headline, mainstream Vatan shouts "His Only Asset is His 
Hostility Against Turkey" and replays van Rompuy's 2004 quip that 
"Turkey is not part of Europe and will never be part of Europe." 
Major TV channels like NTV, CNNTurk report that van Rompuy views the 
EU "as a Christian club with no room for a large Muslim country such 
as Turkey."  In "Anti-Turkey President for EU," leftist-nationalist 
Cumhuriyet  notes that the "Belgian PM took the EU top job with the 
strong support of France and Germany."  Liberal Radikal headline 
reads, "EU Picks Anti-Turkey and Low Key President," noting, "EU 
leaders named Belgian PM van Rompuy, a known anti-Turkey figure, as 
the first EU president."  Mainstream Hurriyet, in "President of the 
Privileged Partners," emphasizes, "EU's new leader was chosen with 
the support of French and German leaders who have opposed Turkish 
membership and called for a privileged partnership instead." 
Hurriyet-on-Line notes that "New EU Leaders Cold to Turkey." 
 
IRAN:  Davutoglu Left After Talking With Clinton (HaberTurk): 
Media outlets highlight "last minute" diplomacy effort vis-`-vis 
Iran by Foreign Minister Davutoglu after an extensive talk with 
Secretary Clinton while both were attending the swearing in ceremony 
in Afghanistan, ending in Davutoglu's sudden departure for Tabriz 
where he is expected to meet with Iranian leaders.  Mainstream 
Hurriyet calls it a "surprise uranium visit" and expects that 
Davutoglu will press Iran to reverse its decision to not send its 
uranium to a third country.  Mainstream Sabah depicts the surprise 
visit as "Davutoglu acts as a bridge between Iran and the West" 
while Islamist oriented Zaman notes "a long chat with Secretary 
Clinton" and concludes Turkey "once again is engaging in active 
diplomacy on the nuclear crisis."  Mainstream Milliyet also reminds 
that Davutoglu expressed Turkey's willingness to continue diplomacy 
with Iran even after the 'storing uranium in Turkey' proposal was 
not accepted by Tehran.  "In a complete mediator spirit, Davutoglu 
will do his best to convince Iran on this formula" the report adds. 
Zaman predicts Davutoglu will use "telephone diplomacy" from Tabriz 
as his visit coincides with the P5+1 meetings today in Brussels. 
 
FBI Mueller's Press for Biometrics 
Turkish commentators digest FBI Director Mueller's Ankara visit from 
different angles today.  "70 Million People Will Be Screened" says 
Ibrahim Karagul in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak who is bothered by 
biometrics.  Noting the widespread speculation that Mueller asked 
Turkish authorities for biometric data on the personal and private 
information of Turks, the writer opines that the effort is "just 
like the way the US is imposing on the EU."   The writer hopes 
"Ankara will say no regardless of Washington's continuous pressure" 
because once the security agreement is signed between the EU and the 
US "Washington will turn to Ankara again for permission" and that 
means "70 million Turks will be treated as potential terrorists." 
In "Gifts Are on the Way,  Vatan columnist Mustafa Mutlu sees the 
FBI Director's visit "as a gift-on-the-way for the ruling AKP." 
Based on the meetings that Mueller had, he argues "Washington seems 
to be working on a favor for AKP by handing over the three PKK 
names" which were listed as drug traffickers by the US Treasury. 
Yilmaz Oztuna of conservative daily Turkiye has a different take. 
He notes the growing visitors traffic between Ankara and Washington, 
including the Mueller visit, which is "setting the ground" for the 
upcoming Obama-Erdogan summit in Washington, DC. 
 
Progress Towards Republic of United Cyprus 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports that the parties in Cyprus are making 
progress in their talks for the unification of the divided island. 
The paper says at their 51st meeting, Turkish-Cypriot leader Talat 
and Greek Cypriot leader Christofias agreed to declare a news 
blackout until the finalization of the talks.  According to 
diplomatic sources, if the parties reach compromise on an united 
Cyprus, the new cabinet will have six Greek and three Turkish

members.  Hurriyet also reports that united Cyprus will not have an 
army and the police force will be the only armed force on the 
island;  that  passports will be the same; and that Turkish and 
Greek will be accepted as official languages, among other proposals. 
 Hurriyet says that property issue remains the major problem at the 
talks and that the Greek Cypriots have "signaled to the EU that 
settlement was unlikely."  The paper opines that the Greek Cypriot 
goal is to "sabotage the possible positive results of the EU summit 
for the assessment of Turkey on December 10-11. " 
 
Senator Kerry Initiates Investigation into Blackwater's Middle East 
Arm Sales 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports that the chairman of the US Foreign 
Relations Committee Senator John Kerry has demanded an investigation 
against the international security company Blackwater, saying that 
the company violated US laws prohibiting the sale of military 
technology and expertise to the foreign countries, such as Iraq. 
Hurriyet reports that the Committee  will also look into allegations 
that some of these illegally imported weapons were sold to the PKK 
in the black market.
