"Pakistani Knot" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (8/13) 
editorialized: "Political instability in Pakistan has made the US 
make contingency plans for a possible fall of dictator Pervez 
Musharraf. Washington's main concerns are the fight against 
terrorism and control over the Pakistani nuclear arsenal. Allied to 
Bush, Musharraf is currently facing a long list of problems.... 
Adding to such problems the dispute with the Judiciary, which has 
made increasingly uncertain his plans to obtain another presidential 
term and maintain himself as the chief of the Armed Forces, we have 
an explanation for the rumors that Musharraf may decree a state of 
emergency. Apparently he did not do so last week because of Secstate 
Condoleezza Rice's intense pressure.... So far there is no sign that 
Musharraf may be overthrown, but his situation is not a tranquil 
one. He has the loyalty of the Army's lay officers, but not that of 
the troops, which, as the majority of the population, are made up of 
religious people who look with suspicion upon the alliance with the 
US and hesitate to repress Islamic radicals."
