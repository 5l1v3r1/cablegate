SUBJECT: U/SYG GUEHENNO: STILL NO AGREEMENT ON UNAMID TCC 
LIST 
 
REF: USUN 01001 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  DPKO U/SYG Guehenno told the Security 
Council November 14 that the Government of the Sudan (GOS) 
has not yet made the strategic decision to cooperate fully 
with UNAMID deployment.  Guehenno said the GOS had not 
finalized agreement on the UN/AU agreed TCC list, which they 
received on October 2, during November 11 discussions with 
DPKO in Addis Ababa.  China and Qatar responded that the 
remaining issues with UNAMID deployment could be resolved 
through the Tripartite Commission and further discussions 
with the GOS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------- 
No Agreement on TCC List From 
Addis GOS-UN Meeting 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) U/SYG Guehenno briefed the Council November 14 on the 
latest developments with UNAMID deployment.  Guehenno said he 
met with representative of the Government of the Sudan (GOS) 
and the African Union on November 11 in Addis Ababa (reftel). 
 Guehenno said he briefed the Sudanese in detail on the TCC 
list.  Guehenno said the Sudanese representatives had 
expressed concern about three of the TCCs:  Norway (Engineer 
Company, composed of Swedish and Norwegian troops) Nepal 
(Infantry) and Thailand (Infantry).  The Sudanese 
representatives asked that the deployment of African TCCs be 
moved ahead of the non-African participants, so as to assuage 
local concerns about non-African participation in UNAMID. 
The Sudanese were particularly concerned about the Nordic 
unit because of the "association" of these countries with the 
popular uproar over the Prophet Muhammad cartoon crisis. 
 
¶3. (U) Guehenno said he went over the deployment schedule 
with the Sudanese and explained why each of these countries 
offered essential components for UNAMID.  Guehenno explained 
that only one of the eighteen units deploying during the 
first phase of UNAMID would be non-African (Thai Infantry) 
and that any adjustments to the timeline would lessen the 
capabilities of the force.  Guehenno said the Sudanese 
representatives initially responded positively before 
conferring again with Khartoum and reiterating that the 
African units would have to come first.  He underscored that 
the GOS has not yet "said no" to the TCC list and left open 
the possibility of a finalized agreement.  He added that the 
GOS still has not made a "strategic decision" to cooperate 
with UNAMID deployment, as demonstrated by the ongoing 
delays.  What was needed now from the GOS, he said, is the 
"political will" to cooperate. 
 
¶4. (U) Guehenno highlighted the need for TCCs to provide 
UNAMID with the remaining shortfalls of specialized military 
assets.  (NOTE: DPKO still needs one section of attack 
helicopters (6 helicopters to a section), three sections of 
medium lift utility helicopters (6 to a section) two 
transport companies.  END NOTE.)  Guehenno said the September 
30 attack on the AMIS peacekeepers in Haskanita had 
demonstrated that UNAMID needed helicopters and logisticial 
assets to defend itself.  He predicted that UNAMID would be 
"tested" early in its deployment.  Guehenno commented that if 
the international community could not find these assets by 
the December 31 Transfer of Authority (TOA) than DPKO would 
have to bring the issue back to the Council for consideration 
of other modalities, such as increasing the force size or 
limiting the area of operations.

¶5. (U) AMB Wolcott said that the Council would need to 
consider further action in the light of President Bashir's 
pattern of non-cooperation with UNAMID.  AMB Wolcott 
highlighted that President Bashir had responded to DPKO's 
attempts to clarify his concerns about UNAMID by making a 
press statement accusing the UN of attempting to deploy 
American and Israeli intelligence operatives with the 
non-African components of UNAMID.  France, the UK, Slovakia 
and Belgium concurred that President Bashir is not 
cooperating with UNAMID and that this was unacceptable. 
French PermRep Ripert criticized the GOS for engaging in the 
"politics of intimidation" to delay UNAMID deployment. 
 
¶6. (U) China repeated it's often stated talking point that 
the remaining UNAMID deployment issues could be resolved 
 
USUN NEW Y 00001022  002 OF 002 
 
 
through the Tripartite Commission (UN, AU and the GOS). 
Qatar said the remaining issues were "primarily technical" 
and could be resolved through further consultations with the 
Sudanese.  AMB Wolcott responded that DPKO had made clear 
that GOS is not fully cooperating with UNAMID deployment. She 
added that if the UN is not able to reach an agreement with 
the Sudanese on the TCC list soon, with only six weeks to go 
until the TOA, the Security Council may need to consider 
"further action" when the issue is discussed again on 
November 26.
