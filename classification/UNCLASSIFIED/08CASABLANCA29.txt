SUBJECT:  VISAS VIPER FOR JANUARY 2008 REPORTING PERIOD 
 
 
¶1. Members of the Embassy Rabat and Consulate General Casablanca 
joint Visas Viper Committee met February 4, 2008.  The meeting was 
chaired by the DCM and was attended by CONS, RAO, LEGATT, DAO, PD, 
CG and RSO. 
 
¶2. Discussion centered on procedures for reviewing information 
gained from press sources, particularly reports of judicial 
proceedings.  In future, Consular Chief will review press reports, 
check names and then report to Visas Viper Committee if any names 
appear not to be in the lookout system.  The Committee does not wish 
to retrace names which may have already been submitted. 
 
¶3. Legatt provided a list of 51 names in Arabic of individuals 
convicted in the Hassan Al Khatab case.  Consular Section Chief will 
get the list translated and review names to determine if all have 
been already entered into the lookout system. No names are being 
submitted for the January 2008 reporting period at this time, 
pending review of the list of names in Arabic submitted to the 
Committee by Legatt. 
 
¶4. The Mission's Visas Viper Coordinator is Consular Chief Miguel 
Ordonez.
