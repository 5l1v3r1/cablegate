¶5.  U.S. citizens are not required to have a Nicaraguan visa 
to enter the country, however upon arrival holders of 
passports other than diplomatic are required to purchase a 
tourist card for $5.  Non-diplomatic passport holders are 
also charged a departure tax of $32. 
 
¶6.  Security assessment: While the Embassy has no 
information to indicate that official or private U.S. 
travelers to Nicaragua are specifically targeted for 
terrorist or criminal activity, there is a continuing risk. 
Violent crime in the capital is increasing and street 
crimes, including robbery and pickpocketing, are common. 
 
¶7.   Based on safety recommendations made by the police 
and published in various newspapers, the RSO recommends 
the following when considering utilizing taxi service: 
(1) Avoid taking taxis if possible, especially after 
7:00 p.m.  The majority of crimes have been reported at 
night. After 10:00 p.m., both taxi drivers and 
passengers automatically become potential victims of an 
assault, sexual assault, or even murder. (2) Before 
taking a taxicab, make sure that it has a red plate and 
that the number is legible.  Also, check that the taxi 
is properly labeled with the Cooperativa name and logo. 
Theses are the names of the most reliable taxi 
cooperatives: Cooperativa de Radio Taxis 25 de Febrero - 
Ph: 222-5218; Cooperativa de Radio Taxis El Gueguense - 
Ph: 249-7036 or call at Hotel Intercontinental 
Metrocentro at 278-4545 (Supervisor's name is Nelly 
Morales); Cooperativa de Radio Taxis 23 de Agosto at 
Hotel Princess - Ph: 270-5045; Cooperativa de Taxis 
Ruleteros Guardabarranco - Ph: 248-2026; Cooperativa de 
Taxi Urbano de Managua La Union - Ph: 249-8536. 
 
¶8.  Medical assessment: Malaria in Nicaragua is endemic - 
particularly in low-lying areas - especially Managua and the 
beaches. As in most of Central America, dengue is also a 
problem.  Personnel are urged to drink bottled water 
particularly in the chancery.  Visitors can check in with 
the medical unit for further information. 
 
¶9.  Access to certain sections of the chancery requires a 
security clearance.  Please advise Embassy of the travelers' 
level of clearance prior to their arrival. 
 
¶10.  This is the rainy season in Managua with daytime highs 
in the 90's and evening temperatures falling to 80's.  Coat 
and tie business attire are required for calls on GON 
officials, but informal dress (open-collar shirts and slacks 
for men and summer dresses and skirts and blouses for women) 
is appropriate for other calls.
