POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
¶2.  SARAY (VAN) TORTURE VICTIM RE-ARRESTED 
(Evrensel)  Saray (Van) torture victim Okan Yurdabak 
was re-arrested on November 17 after he had filed suit 
against torturers.  Yurdabak claimed the local 
Jandarma commander insulted and threatened him for 
filing suit.  Later the same day, Yurdabak was 
released.  He earlier claimed that Saray Jandarma 
officials had raped him with a truncheon while in 
custody after being arrested following a fight over a 
land dispute.  He reportedly applied to the Van Human 
Rights Association (HRA) for assistance as he was 
afraid he might "disappear" while in custody. 
 
 
¶3.  STUDENT ARRESTED FOR SPEAKING IN KURDISH 
(Evrensel)  A Hazro (Diyarbakir) high school student 
was arrested and threatened with a pistol for speaking 
in Kurdish at school. 
 
 
¶4.  CLOSURE OF STUDENT ASSOCIATION EXTENDED 
(Evrensel)  The Dicle University (Diyarbakir) Students 
Association, which had been closed for three months 
under Article 11/0 of the State of Emergency (OHAL) 
Law, was re-closed on November 18, when the earlier 
three-month closure ended.  The closure stemmed from 
the association's "disrupting general security and 
public order, and causing acts of violence to 
increase." 
 
 
¶5.  CONTINUED PRO-OCALAN PROTESTS 
(Evrensel)  Hundreds of youths staged demonstrations 
in six Batman districts to protest implementation of 
isolation policies against PKK (KADEK) leader Abdullah 
Ocalan.  The youths marched, carrying torches and 
Ocalan posters, and shouting pro-Ocalan slogans. 
 
 
¶6.  ADANA BUSINESS LEADER DISPLEASED WITH NEW CABINET 
(Bolge)  Adana Chamber of Industry president Umit 
Ozgumus criticized the new government for not 
appointing a minister from Adana.  Ozgumus complained 
Adana, Turkey's sixth largest province, has been 
neglected.

¶7.  SIRNAK TEMPORARY WORKERS LAID OFF 
(Evrensel)  Citing budgetary reasons, the municipality 
of Sirnak laid off 70 temporary workers hired prior to 
the November 3 parliamentary elections.  The 
Democratic People's Party (DEHAP) provincial chairman 
claimed the workers were employed as election graft 
and were told to vote for the Motherland Party (ANAP). 
According to the chairman, the workers were dismissed 
after the elections when ANAP failed to pass the 10% 
election threshold to enter the parliament.
