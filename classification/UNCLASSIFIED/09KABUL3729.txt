SUBJECT: IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY THIS WINTER IN AFGHANISTAN

¶1.  SUMMARY: Although 2009 saw the largest harvest in Afghanistan in 
30 years, food insecurity continues to affect approximately 
one-third of rural households, with an additional 30% facing 
periodic food security problems.  The lack of purchasing power is 
now the primary cause of food insecurity, not the absence food. 
According to USAID's Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS-NET), 
supply has improved significantly following the historic wheat 
harvest, a 50% decrease in wheat prices, and generous food aid 
distribution.  USAID's Afghanistan Vouchers for Increased Productive 
Agriculture (AVIPA) program increased the availability of essential 
inputs during the 2009 winter wheat planting season, improving the 
quality and increasing the quantity of the harvest.  The expansion 
of cultivated land by 1 million hectares in 2008/2009 (Ministry of 
Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) statistics) has also 
been a factor.  Despite this progress, food insecurity among 
vulnerable populations is on the rise as winter 2009/2010 
approaches.  Food insecurity will be most pronounced in remote 
regions, larger cities, flood-affected areas, and among internally 
displaced persons (IDPs).  USG efforts targeting these populations 
are expected to assist them in meeting their food needs this winter. 
 The USG will continue to monitor the situation closely.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. Harsh winter weather will affect Afghanistan very soon; we have 
put together this summary for Washington agencies of USAID-supported 
food security programs.  These include: support to the World Food 
Program (WFP), Protracted Relief & Recovery Operation (PRRO), a Food 
for Peace (FFP) Multi-Year Assistance Program (MYAP) implemented by 
World Vision, support to the FEWS-NET and preparing to address 
unforeseen events. 
 
ONGOING EFFORTS 
 
¶3.  The World Food Program (WFP) provides assistance to Afghanistan 
through a combination of relief and recovery activities.  Projects 
are implemented in partnership with the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA), other UN agencies, Community 
Development Councils (CDCs), and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs).  Through this program, the USG provided 157,520 metric tons 
(MTs) of wheat, valued at $167 million in FY 2008, and 62,190 MTs of 
wheat, valued at $60 million in FY 2009.  In response to a joint 
GIRoA and United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) 
appeal, the USG provided an additional 85,000 MTs, valued at $90 
million, in assistance specifically for winterization planning and 
pre-positioning of food commodities for the 2009/2010 winter.  As of 
October 20, 80%of the commodities had been pre-positioned for 
accessibility in the winter months in 19 targeted provinces 
throughout Afghanistan, including those considered to be most food 
insecure.  WFP anticipates completing 100% of pre-positioning by 
mid-November, thus mitigating the hunger season in Afghanistan that 
lasts from approximately November through late April every year. 
 
¶4.  The Multi-Year Assistance Program (MYAP) in Ghor province, 
implemented by World Vision (WV) with USAID support, seeks to reduce 
food insecurity by improving food utilization and increasing 
household resiliency to shocks.  The program specifically targets 
children under five with an emphasis on children under 24 months of 
age and pregnant and lactating women.  During the life of this 
three-year program, WV will distribute over $33 million in food 
commodities to vulnerable groups.  In addition to their ongoing 
program, WV will allocate resources to populations affected by 
shocks, including natural disasters, political conflicts, and those 
who have been internally displaced.  The WV support will ensure that 
vulnerable populations do not continue to backslide during the 
winter months when livelihood opportunities are minimal.  In 
consultation with USAID, WV will distribute a four-month ration of 
yellow peas, oil, and rice and wheat flour directly to program 
participants (52,000 beneficiaries) prior to the start of hunger 
season when roads become impassable due to snow.  The ration will 
cover the entirety of the hunger season, with WV resuming planned 
distribution in March 2010.  As household food stocks are at their 
lowest level during November-April, it is unlikely that the 
commodities will appear on the market. 
 
¶5.  The Cash-For-Work and Voucher Program in Bamyan, Ghor, and Hirat 
Provinces, implemented by Catholic Relief Services (CRS) with USAID 
support, targets 23,000 vulnerable families (138,000 individuals) 
affected by successive shocks including drought, floods, high food 
prices, and severe winter conditions, which combined, have severely 
eroded assets and coping mechanisms.  By generating household 
income, vulnerable family access to immediate basic needs during the 
upcoming winter period will be improved. 
 
¶6.  FEWS-NET is vital in providing weather and food security 
 
KABUL 00003729  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
information for Afghanistan, and has been critical in identifying 
vulnerable populations and mitigating the effects of shocks. 
FEWS-NET regularly undertakes essential monitoring and food security 
assessments to inform decision-makers throughout the winter. 
Monthly reports provide critical data on food commodity prices and 
the current food security situation.  Weekly reports provide data on 
weather forecasts.  The most recent Food Security Update for 
Afghanistan highlights needs in chronically food insecure zones 
which are characterized by challenging climatic conditions and 
inaccessibility, in addition to major cities, and areas affected by 
floods and/or with war-related IDPs.  USAID shares information 
concerning these vulnerable populations its partners and GIRoA and 
adjusts programming to prevent further deterioration during the 
hunger season. 
 
COMMENT 
 
¶7.  USAID efforts to prevent and mitigate Afghan hunger through 
programs with GIRoA, international bodies and NGOs support MAIL's 
National Agriculture Development Framework through capacity building 
with GIRoA national and provincial staff.  In addition to working 
with MAIL and the Ministry of Public Health, the programs partner 
with the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development, with 
direct links to the U.S. Agriculture Assistance Strategy for 
Afghanistan to increase the MAIL's service delivery.  The activities 
work together to provide food security and support the 
counter-insurgency (COIN) strategy in strengthening the GIRoA's 
legitimacy, and by securing vulnerable populations that might 
otherwise be at risk of being recruited by the insurgents.
