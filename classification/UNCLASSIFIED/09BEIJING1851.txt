Â¶1. (SBU) China was "flexible" if additional states wished to 
participate in the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of 
Somalia (CGPCS), MFA International Organizations and 
Conferences Department UN Affairs Division official Cheng Lie 
told PolOff July 2 in response to reftel points encouraging 
China's support for aspirant countries to join the CGPCS. 
Cheng said China had "no strong opinion" on the issue, and 
was willing to find an understanding based on the January 
communique.  However Cheng noted that China would like to 
keep full membership restricted to nation states and not 
grant the same status to international organizations such as 
the United Nations and European Union, NGOs and industry 
representatives.
