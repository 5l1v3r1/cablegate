"One Step Forward To Non-Proliferation. But Iran Still Behind" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo's Paris 
correspondent Giles Lapouge reported (2/14): "North Korea has agreed 
to close its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. If the Beijing agreement 
is maintained, it will be the end of a 13-year negotiation to 
overcome the deadly risk that the North Korean arsenal 
represents.... But there is one question: since the 1994 agreement 
was broken by North Korea, shouldn't we worry that the agreement 
signed in Beijing will also be broken by the lunatic and worrisome 
Kim Jong-il?  First, the guarantees North Korea obtained now are 
much more advantageous than those of 1994.... Second, now North 
Korea has negotiated with five great powers, including China, which 
exerts strong influence on Pyongyang. Moreover, North Korea's 
internal situation is abominable.... The assistance promised by the 
five powers is its only protection against chaos. If the agreement 
is respected, it will be an immense step toward non-proliferation. 
But the final victory is not assured, since Iran continues to 
develop its own nuclear program. The Iranians are astute and have 
sent signs contradicting what their own Mullahs say. Under such a 
rhetorical exercise, the threat continues.... The Americans, who 
never believed in the EU's peaceful approach to Tehran, are 
exasperated. Their patience with Iran as well as with the Europeans 
is ending. The way offered to the Europeans is a narrow one.  If 
they persist with their posture, they will run the risk of two 
disgraces:  first, allowing Iran to truly become a nuclear power; 
then they may force the U.S. to bomb Iran with the risk of starting 
a fire throughout the Middle East."
