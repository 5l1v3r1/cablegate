SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON LIGHTER BAN

 ¶1.  (U) As discussed with TSA in reftelcons, the Government 
of Canada (GOC) is still seeking to find the regulatory means 
to implement the ban on lighters on U.S.-bound aircraft.  The 
GOC is considering the issue of whether a policy change such 
as the addition of lighters to the list of prohibited items 
on aircraft requires legislative approval under the Public 
Safety Act, or whether the Ministry of Transport can direct 
immediate implementation of the regulation. 
 
¶2.  (U) Post presented demarche and talking points in reftel 
C to Transport Canada on March 14, and subsequently delivered 
copies of TSA's press release and website information 
regarding the lighter ban to Transport Canada as well as 
Deputy Prime Minister McLellan's office.  Post has also 
discussed the ban on lighters with the Air Transport 
Association of Canada. 
 
¶3.  (U) Post understands that TSA has granted a two-week 
grace period starting April 14 during which the GOC is 
expected to come up with the means to implement the ban on 
lighters.  Post will attempt to help in finding the 
appropriate mechanism to enable the GOC to comply with the 
new regulation.
