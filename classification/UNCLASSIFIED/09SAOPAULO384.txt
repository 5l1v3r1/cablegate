Title- The ultimatum to Honduras 
 
Editorial in center-right newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo (7-2) 
states: "We have never seen something like this in the shameful 
history of Latin American coup d'tats, which we believed were 
over....the coup against Zelaya was the roughest conceivable answer 
to his Chavista-like decision to call, by decree, a public 
consultation for the possible realization of a plebiscite [regarding 
his reelection]....It is not clear whether the State Department did 
everything it could to avoid the proclamation in Tegucigalpa.  But 
all nonsense aside, Obama....could not let Hugo Chavez take 
advantage of this occasion to pose as the champion of democracy in 
the Hemisphere....."
