SUBJECT: RUSSIA: INVITATION TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS EXPO 
 
¶1.  On April 24 Yekaterina Slizkova, Deputy Chief of the Section for 
International Cooperation of the Ministry for Information 
Technologies and Communications (MinInformSvyazi), extended an 
invitation from Minister Leonid Reyman to Commerce Secretary 
Gutierrez to attend the October 25-27 InfoCom telecommunications 
conference in Moscow.  During a meeting with FCS and EST officers, 
Slizkova said Reyman will send a letter by the end of May containing 
the invitation and describing a proposed roundtable of 
telecommunication companies and officials. She provided a list of 17 
Russian agencies and companies suggested for the roundtable, which 
will be separately transmitted to the Department of Commerce.

working group on telecommunications.  The Ministry suggested the 
working group be chaired by a deputy minister or equivalent and meet 
semi-annually in various Russian or American cities.

consider participation in the newly created technoparks.  She 
promised to send information on the federal and regional funding for 
such technoparks, their structure and operations.
