¶1.  CAN CHINA SAVE THE WORLD? 
 
"More communication and exchanges needed" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) (08/10): 
"Time magazine recently published a cover story with the title, 'Can 
China save the world?' which has once again focused international 
media attention on China.  This attention is obviously related to 
the global financial crisis, which analysts argue has pushed China 
to the front of the world stage too early.  The world believes that 
once China recovers from the financial crisis and demonstrates the 
capability to withstand economic difficulties, the influence of its 
successful economic model will grow.  Although some Westerners have 
realized that it is hard for them to understand China's development 
using old theories and perspectives, they still cannot rid 
themselves of these influences when analyzing China.  This time, 
though, reporting by Western media has been more objective and not 
as 'black and white' as previous reporting.  China and Western 
countries need more communication and exchanges to enhance mutual 
trust and understanding." 
 
¶2.  U.S. AND CHINA IN AFRICA 
 
"Western countries need to learn from China how to respect Africa" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao) (08/11): "Western media claim that Secretary 
Clinton's visit to Africa was aimed at China since the U.S.'s 
influence in Africa has been challenged by China.  The Western world 
has always viewed African countries as passive players in 
international relations, players that can be easily manipulated and 
influenced by other powers.  African countries realize that they 
cannot elicit real concern from Western powers about their 
livelihood even if they sacrifice their dignity.  In contrast, China 
respects African countries' political dignity and expresses real 
concern about bringing African people dignified lives through 
economic cooperation with Africa.  Only by viewing African countries 
on an equal basis can [foreign countries] win real friendship with 
them.  Western countries should learn from China how to respect 
Africa." 
 
¶3.  U.S.-CHINA TRADE RELATIONS 
 
"China should counter-attack U.S. trade protectionism" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (07/29): "The possible U.S. sanctions against 
China's tire industry have created a dangerous situation for China's 
tire exports.  China should enact countermeasures as soon as 
possible.  Once the special protection measure (on tire imports) is 
implemented, there will be a big trade dispute between China and the 
U.S.  The U.S. should not expect China to just bear the punishment. 
While the U.S. is setting limits on Chinese imports, China can also 
set limits on imports of U.S. products.  In addition, China is the 
biggest holder of U.S. Treasury bonds, and has every reason to sell 
the bonds and make the U.S. pay a heavy price for its actions. 
Surely this will result in a lose-lose situation.  However, using 
such countermeasures can demonstrate the country's deterrent 
ability, through which it can avoid being taken advantage of in 
trade negotiations and prevent the break out of a trade war.  China 
must learn from the tire case to be more flexible in using 
counter-measures within the framework of the World Trade 
Organization to increase its influence in trade negotiations.  China 
should learn to fight for every penny with strong and fair 
arguments."
