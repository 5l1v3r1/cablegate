¶1. (SBU) At the June 26 hearing of imprisoned Al Ghad Party 
leader Ayman Nour's appeal for health parole, Mohamed al 
Husseini (presiding judge of the State Council's 
Administrative Court) ruled that he could not yet issue a 
decision on Nour's case, because a governmental forensic 
medical committee has not provided an assessment of the 
health of Ahmed Mazloum (a 22-year old imprisoned drug 
dealer, also appealing for health parole, whose case was tied 
to Nour's in the May 31 ruling of Judge Adel Gomaa at the 
Cairo Criminal Court).  Husseini, noting that Mazloum is 
allegedly paralyzed and suffering from maggot-infested sores 
due to his being bed-ridden in prison, asked that the 
forensic committee provide an immediate report on Mazloum's 
health.  Husseini said that the court will hear Nour and 
Mazloum's appeals again on July 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mid-way through the hearing, the lead government 
prosecutor delivered a belligerent soliloquy complaining 
about the presence of "foreign observers" in the courtroom 
(poloff was in attendance, along with UK and Canadian 
poloffs). The state prosecutor singled out poloff, noting, 
"It is ridiculous and illegal that foreign observers should 
be in this courtroom!  We hold Egyptian judges in such high 
esteem that they are above having the First Secretary of the 
U.S. Embassy trying to oversee them."  Judge Husseini 
responded that this was a public hearing, and therefore 
anyone who wants to can attend, and that the state lawyer 
should "speak about issues related to the case at hand, not 
such irrelevant matters."  The state prosecutor left in an 
apparent huff, and the courtroom, which was packed with Al 
Ghad supporters, burst into cheers.
