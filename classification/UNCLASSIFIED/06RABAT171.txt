----------------------------------- 
Maroc Telecom Revenue up 18 Percent 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  Maroc Telecom's 2005 fourth quarter revenue was up 18 
percent over the previous year to $574 million, mostly 
resulting from the strength of its mobile phone division. 
The company's mobile phone customer base grew 38 percent 
during 2005 to 8.8 million.  An increase in ADSL internet 
lines to 242,000 helped sustain the performance of the 
company's fixed-line division. 
 
--------------------------- 
Cameras to Detect Avian Flu 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Thermal imaging cameras have been installed at 
Casablanca's Mohammed V International Airport to detect 
signs of avian influenza symptoms among passengers and 
prevent the disease from entering Morocco.  Noting that 
avian flu has not appeared in Morocco, Health Minister 
Mohammed Cheikh Biadillah said the country has nonetheless 
ordered one million doses of antiviral drugs from France's 
Pasteur Institute as a precautionary measure. 
 
--------------------------- 
Electricity for Rural Areas 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3.  The Moroccan National Electricity Office (ONE) will 
connect 4,500 rural villages to the national electrical grid 
in 2006, providing some 206,000 families with access to 
power for the first time.  An additional 21,000 families in 
500 villages will be supplied with solar photovoltaic kits 
which provide power for lights and small electrical 
appliances like TVs and radios.  These expansions will bring 
the level of rural electrification in Morocco to 89 percent 
of all villages by the end of 2006, up from just 18 percent 
in 1994.  To do this, the ONE will invest $4.2 billion 
during the 2006-2010 period. 
 
------------------------------ 
Moving Away from Oil Subsidies 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  Morocco's oil imports bill rose by 65 percent in the 
first 11 months of 2005 compared to the previous year, 
costing the country $2.46 billion.  The government continues 
to subsidize the price of fuel in Morocco; although the GOM 
raised fuel prices three times in 2005 to try to reduce the 
gap between what the state and the consumer pay.  The 
government is now considering establishing an indexation 
system under which internal prices would be directly 
determined by international oil prices.  The GOM is also 
working to diversify imported energy sources, develop 
renewable energy, and promote oil exploration within 
Morocco.  Diversification has helped decrease the share of 
oil products in the country's total energy consumption from 
74 percent in 1995 to 60 percent in 2005, mostly through an 
increase in use of coal, the introduction of natural gas in 
electricity production, and the use of wind energy.

National Airline Nets Record Income 
 
RABAT 00000171  002 OF 002 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Moroccan national airline Royal Air Maroc (RAM) earned a 
record $31 million in 2005 despite high fuel prices.  The 
company's gross income in 2005 was $934 million, a nine 
percent increase over the previous year.  RAM and its low- 
cost offshoot Atlas Blue - created in October 2004 - served 
4.5 million passengers in 2005, a 20 percent increase over 
¶2004. 
 
-------------------------- 
Cost of Living up Slightly 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Morocco's cost of living index rose by one percent for 
the year 2005, reflecting the slight increases in the prices 
of food products (up 0.3 percent) and non-food products (up 
1.5 percent).  Inflation for 2004 was 1.5 percent.  2005 
inflation was highest in the south-western city of Agadir 
(up 1.5 percent), and central-south city of Marrakech (up 
1.4 percent), while Meknes and Fez (center) registered the 
lowest increases.
