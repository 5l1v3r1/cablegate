¶1. This cable contains highlights of recent economic 
developments in the following areas: 
 
¶A. IPR Enforcement Strengthened 
¶B. Pending bounced check legislation 
¶C. Rising oil prices affecting balance of trade 
¶D. Oil transport contract with Algeria via pipeline 
¶E. UAE investments in Tunisia increasing 
 
-------------------------------- 
¶A. IPR Enforcement Strengthened 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. The GOT intensified its campaign to strengthen its 
intellectual property rights (IPR) regime via increased 
public awareness, media campaigns, and raids launched against 
counterfeit products and trademarks violations.  On June 29, 
2006, the Ministry of Commerce conducted a raid on vendors of 
counterfeit personal care products, in one of Tunis, 
markets.  According to official sources, these campaigns and 
raids will continue to be carried out periodically and will 
cover all trade sectors.  Recently, the Minister of Commerce 
explained the GOT,s plan to tackle the "black market" via 
strict application of existing laws and passing of tough new 
legislation including enhanced enforcement powers for customs 
officials.  Comment: GOT says this every year but recently 
there has been an increase in the number of prosecutions (71) 
against parallel market operators. Authorities have also 
conducted inspections of trade fair exhibitions resulting in 
111 businesses being banned from participation in the trade 
fairs due to IPR violations. GOT appears to be getting the 
message that protection of IPR is good for the economy. End 
comment. 
 
------------------------------------ 
¶B. Pending bounced check legislation 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. There is new legislation before parliament which will 
address the problem of bounced checks.  New procedures will 
be set in place to help vendors determine whether a customer 
has sufficient funds in his/her bank account to cover checks 
written against that account.  Any interested person, or 
entity, can contact the Central Bank and verify whether there 
are sufficient funds in an account to cover the customer,s 
check before accepting that check as payment for goods 
purchased.   All banks have been asked to inform the Central 
Bank about the reasons behind their refusal to accept checks 
written against a customer,s account (i.e. reported as 
stolen or lost check, frozen account, or account closure). 
The Central Bank will take on the role of central depository 
of checking account information.  The new law requires banks 
to provide the Central Bank with accurate account 
information.

¶C. Rising oil prices affecting balance of trade 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4. According to the Tunisian Central Bank, the current 
deficit increased to TND 693 million (USD 533.07 million) 
over the first five months of 2006, corresponding to 1.7 
percent of GDP compared to 0.8 percent over the same period 
in 2005. The trade deficit increased by about TND 360 million 
(USD 276.92 million) due largely to the increased cost of 
petroleum products.  If energy products are excluded, the 
increase would be TND 142 million (USD 109.23 million). 
Imports of energy products increased notably (50.1 percent of 
total imports), as did imports of capital goods (14.4 
percent).  Imports of raw materials and semi-finished 
products were also up.  Energy exports accounted for 39.7 
percent of total exports and mechanical and electrical 
industries accounted for 20.7 percent.  Export sales in 
textile and clothing sector dropped by 4.2 percent. As of 
 
TUNIS 00001741  002 OF 002 
 
 
June 26, 2006, foreign currency reserves amounted to TND 
4.989 billion (USD 3.837 billion), corresponding to 100 days 
of imports.  Foreign trade provisional data (thru June 20, 
2006) indicates increases of 10.2 percent in exports and 12.7 
percent in imports. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
¶D. Oil transport contract with Algeria via pipeline 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶5. Algeria,s Sonatrach signed a renewable, one year contract 
with Societe Tunisienne de Transport par Pipeline au Sahara 
(Trapsa).  The contract provides for Trapsa to carry Algerian 
oil from the Illizi basin on the Algerian-Tunisian border to 
ports on the Mediterranean for shipment abroad. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
¶E. UAE investments in Tunisia increasing 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Recently Tunisia has become attractive for United Arab 
Emirates'(UAE) investments, particularly two companies: Dubai 
Holding and Emaar Properties PJSC.  In 2005, Dubai Holding 
bought a 12 percent stake in one of the major Tunisian 
conglomerates, Abdennadher Group. In March 29, 2006, 
Tecom-DIG, a branch of Dubai Holding won the bid to buy 35 
percent of Tunisia's public telephone operator Tunisie 
Telecom.  On June 28, 2006, President Ben Ali approved Dubai 
Holding's project to invest USD 6 billion in developing the 
South Tunis lake area.  This mega-project will involve the 
building of a business center, marinas, residential and 
commercial buildings, sports and leisure facilities, as well 
as light, non-polluting industries.  On April 15, 2006, Emaar 
Properties PJSC announced its plans to develop the USD 1.88 
billion Marina Al Qussor project on Tunisia's eastern 
coastline.  This 1,092 acre Marina development in the 
governorate of Sousse will include residential options, 
tourist attractions, and a large marina.   The size of the 
project indicates the importance of tourism to Tunisia,s 
economic development.  Tunisia attracted 6.4 million tourists 
in 2005 and is aiming for tourism revenue of close to USD 2 
billion in 2006.
