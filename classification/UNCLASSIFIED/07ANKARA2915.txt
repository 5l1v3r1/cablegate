In Today's Papers 
 
Ambassador Wilson: "The Exchange of Information is Producing Good 
Results" 
Aksam, Sabah, Cumhuriyet:  While answering journalists' questions at 
the reception celebrating Finland's national day, US Ambassador Ross 
Wilson said that the "exchange of information is producing good 
results.  We have been working very hard and very closely with 
Turkey since the meeting at the Oval Office in the beginning of 
November.  Turkey and the US exchanged a lot of information before 
the November meeting, but since then, we have worked more 
intensively and I think it is producing good results."  When asked 
why he had not met with DTP deputies, the Ambassador said that 
"officials from the Embassy in Ankara have been meeting with many 
people in different levels.  As a separate matter, I think it is 
important for DTP's members in the parliament to separate themselves 
more clearly from terrorism."  Cumhuriyet reported the same news 
under the headline "No Concrete Stance from Washington. Wilson did 
not say 'I won't talk with DTP.'"  When asked for his opinion on the 
draft constitution, Ambassador Wilson said "I am having meetings 
with some MPs and academics regarding the draft constitution and am 
trying to learn more about the topics on Turkey's agenda." 
 
DTP Chairman Nurettin Demirtas Postpones his Return from Europe 
Sabah, Cumhuriyet, Aksam, Hurriyet, Milliyet and others:  In a 
written statement, DTP Chairman Nurettin Demirtas said that, due to 
programs organized by DTP offices in Europe, he will not be able to 
return to Turkey until the end of December.  In response to DTP 
deputy Sirri Sakik's remarks that it is not easy for them to accept 
a chairman from outside the parliament, Demirtas said "those who 
cannot accept my chairmanship are those who could not adopt 
democracy". 
 
Meanwhile, Milliyet and Sabah report that the DTP's Erzincan branch 
chairman Huseyin Bektasoglu was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison for 
using the honorific (sayin) while referring to jailed PKK leader 
Ocalan. 
 
Foreign Minister Gul in Turkmenistan 
All papers report that President Abdullah Gul visited Turkmenistan. 
This is the first exchange between the two nations since 2002. 
Vatan says that the visit opened a new chapter in ties between 
Turkey and Turkmenistan.  Milliyet says that the visit led to 
important developments in natural gas products, namely that the 
Turkmenistan president responded positively to the Turkish proposal 
for transporting Turkmen natural gas from Turkey to Europe. 
 
Meanwhile, Sabah reports that the White House is making the 
necessary arrangements to host President Gul and the official date 
for the visit will be announced by the White House. 
 
Coca Cola's New Turkish CEO 
All papers report that the Coca Cola company, which has a market 
value of $140 billion, announced that Turkish businessman Murat Kent 
will become the company's CEO as of July 2008.  Kent became 
president and chief operating officer of the company's North Asia, 
Eurasia and Middle East group in May 2005 and became president of 
Coca Cola International in February 2006.  He started serving as 
chief operating officer of the company in December 2006.  With this 
assignment, Kent became the first Turk to be assigned to such a 
high-level post in a global company. 
 
New Controversy in Malatya Murder Case 
Cumhuriyet, Milliyet, Vatan, Taraf, Yeni Safak:   Papers highlight a 
new controversy in the murder of three missionaries in Malatya.  It 
was recently discovered that key suspect Emre Gunaydin's gun was 
seized by the police the day before the murders took place. 
Nevertheless, the same gun was found at the murder sight.  Following 
this new development, the prosecutor initiated a new investigation 
into the murder. 
 
ANKARA 00002915  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
Sale of Sabah-ATV Media Group:  Turkey's TSMF (Savings Deposits and 
Insurance Fund) approved the sale of Sabah daily and ATV television 
to Calik Group for $1.1 billion.  Final approval from the 
Radio-Television Supreme Board and the Competition Board is still 
pending. 
 
Cumhuriyet highlights a significant rise of pro-government media 
share with this sale.  Along with the sale of Sabah media group, 
newspapers controlled by the government or pro-government entities 
reach 43.1 percent of the newspaper market share and 32.7 percent of 
the television market. 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: Iran 
 
"Eyes Blinded By Oil" 
Haluk Ulman commented in economic-political daily Dunya (12/7): 
"The NIE report on Iran's nuclear program creates intense debates 
about the virtue of Bush administration's policy on Iran.  The NIE 
report this time clearly tells differently than previous ones, and 
also makes a projection for the future by saying that Iran cannot 
reach a level of nuclear weapon producing capability before 
2010-2015.  All of this is good enough to invalidate President 
Bush's argument about the need to strike Iran.  On the other hand, 
the possibility of a strike against Iran cannot be considered as 
completely out of the question. Given President Bush's unilateral 
tendency, Iran might be turning into another Iraq.  Despite the lack 
of proof of Saddam's weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Bush was 
so determined to invade Iraq that he did it anyway.  Even when the 
WMD allegation was proven false, he played normal.  Unfortunately 
due to the advice and push by the neo-cons, the administration is 
eager to gain control over Iranian and Iraqi oil reserves."
