SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON THE EXPORT OF U.S. DEFENSE ARTICLES CITING THE CANADIAN 
EXEMPTION 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on transactions citing the 
Canadian exemption for the export of aircraft component parts 
to Canada.  Embassy is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: U.S. exporter Tailored Logistics 
Corporation appears on the DTCC Watchlist; also 
vague/incomplete description of commodity and end-use in 
export filing.  End-user Orenda Aerospace has not previously 
been the subject of a Blue Lantern. 
 
¶4. ACTION OTTAWA: Mission Canada is requested to make 
inquiries with appropriate officials to establish the bona 
fides of end-user Orenda Aerospace and to obtain all relevant 
details of the export of aircraft component parts to Canada 
citing the Canadian exemption, including the exact 
description, number, type, dollar value, and serial number of 
items.  PM/DTCC also requests that post conducts a site visit 
to the company in order to provide Department with an 
assessment of its business operations and on-site security. 
Finally, post is asked to assess whether the company appears 
to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  If a site visit is 
not possible, please inform the PM/DTCC officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--What were the exact United States Munitions List (USML) 
articles exported to you?  (Automated Export System (AES) 
filing data provides the following information, "other parts 
of airplanes or helicopters for u".) 
 
--What is the exact end-use for these USML items?  Will 
Orenda Aerospace retain positive control over the aircraft 
component parts at all times?  Will they be transferred to 
other end-users in Canada or re-exported? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of the company's business?  Have they 
previously sought defense articles on the USML? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer 
and re-export? 
 
END ACTION.
