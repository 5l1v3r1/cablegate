¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel demarche to Elie Mekhael, 
Secretary General of the Council for Children at the Ministry 
of Social Affairs (MSA) on May 7.  Mekhael said he was very 
interested in attending the UNESCO Conference on the 
Counterradicalization of Youth being held in Bahrain June 
15-17, but due to the MSA's tight budget, he would be unable 
to attend.  He asked PolOff for funding suggestions and said 
he would encourage local NGOs contacts to participate if 
UNESCO financial support was limited civil society 
participants. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: Post welcomes the Department's suggestions 
on possible sources of financial assistance to help SYG 
Mekhael to attend the UNESCO conference.  This is a key topic 
in Lebanon and Mekhael would be a useful contributor to the 
conference discussions.  End Comment.
