Demand for GOS Bond Issuances May Signal Reduced Market 
Concern 
 
1.(U) The Treasury issued 6.58 million euros of 12- and 
18-month paper on February 16, 5 billion euros of 15-year 
bonds on February 17, and 958 million euros of 30-year bonds 
on February 18. Demand was heavy, as over 14 billion euros of 
orders were placed for the 15-year bonds and 1.9 billion 
euros of orders were placed for the 30-year bonds. The 
interest rates were 80 to 90 basis points above those of 
similar German debt; two weeks ago, spreads on other Spanish 
debt had briefly been above 100 basis points.  Secretary of 
State for Economy Campa said the high demand was a positive 
sign. President Zapatero credited GOS efforts to combat a 
market "mistake and misjudgment."  Campa visited New York and 
Boston to discuss the GOS' economic plans with institutions 
interested in Spanish debt. (El Pais, 2/18 and 2/19) 
 
Anti-Crisis Commission Formed 
 
2.(U) President Zapatero announced an Economic Anti-Crisis 
Commission headed by Minister of Economy/Finance Salgado, 
Minister of Industry, Tourism, and Commerce Sebastian, and 
Minister of Public Works Blanco.  The Commission will have 
two months to work with opposition parties on drafting an 
acceptable economic plan for presentation to the Congress. 
The Commission is to present its first draft on February 25 
when it begins negotiations with opposition party members. 
Opposition Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy expressed 
skepticism, saying the new plan would have to be different 
from Zapatero's previous plans in order to win his party's 
support.  Some reports expressed surprise over the exclusion 
from the commission of Labor Minister Corbacho at a time when 
many see unemployment approaching 20% as the country's most 
serious economic problem and others see labor reforms as a 
necessity.  (El Pais, 2/19; ABC, 2/18) 
 
Loan Delinquency Rates Continue to Rise 
 
3.(U) Banking system loan delinquency rates rose to just over 
5% in December, the highest rate since May of 1996.  Although 
savings banks ("cajas") as a group have generally reported 
higher delinquency rates than banks as a group, bank and caja 
rates were nearly identical in December, in part because 
Spain's second largest bank, BBVA, reclassified 1.8 billion 
euros of loans as doubtful.  Consumer credit delinquency 
increased, while mortgage delinquency rates remain moderate, 
helped by the decline in the Euribor rate that sets 
variable-rate mortgage payments.  (El Pais, 2/19)
