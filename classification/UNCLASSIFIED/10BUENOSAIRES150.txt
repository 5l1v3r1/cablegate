SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶1.   Haiti continues to make headlines in Argentina, focusing on 
concerns of prolonged U.S. military involvement, trafficking in 
persons and the need for more humanitarian assistance.  Largest 
circulation Clarin quoted U.S. Army Col. Gregory Kane, Director of 
U.S. Joint Task Force Haiti operations, that U.S. troops will stay 
in Haiti "as long as necessary."  Clarin also reported on an 
anti-U.S. leftist demonstration against the U.S. military presence 
in Haiti, in part one of a two-part side-box overshadowing a report 
on a meeting between the Ambassador and Argentine Defense Minister 
Nilda Garre to discuss the situation in Haiti.  One editorial 
called the ten Americans' attempt to take Haitian children a case 
of trafficking in persons.  Several reports covered former 
President Bill Clinton's visit to Haiti, with most describing 
Haitians as ??????sleeping in the outside?????? and demanding more 
tents 
and assistance.  End summary. 
 
 
 
U.S. TROOPS WILL STAY 
 
IN HAITI "AS LONG AS NECESSARY" 
 
------------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶2.   Largest circulation Clarin (2/7) quoted U.S. Army Col. Gregory 
Kane, Director of U.S. Joint Task Force Haiti operations, that U.S. 
troops will stay in Haiti "as long as necessary." The article 
contrasted these remarks with Doctors Without Borders' complaint 
about U.S. troops hindering the arrival of food and medicine for 
Haiti and the upcoming UNASUR meeting.  On 2/8, the paper 
highlighted that the February 9 UNASUR summit in Quito is aimed at 
finding a long-term cooperation strategy in Haiti rather than an 
emergency aid plan, and that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez 
confirmed he would attend.

¶3.   Leading Clarin (2/6) and centrist radio station Radio Uno 
reported on an anti-U.S. demonstration staged against the U.S. 
military presence in Haiti.  In Part One of a two-part side-box on 
Haiti, Clarin quoted a spokesperson of one of the leftist groups 
staging the demonstration, who criticized the Argentine government 
for participating in the ??????occupation of a brother country." 
 
 
 
¶4.   In Part Two of the side-box, Clarin reported that the 
Ambassador met with Argentine Defense Minister Nilda Garre to 
discuss the situation in Haiti, conveying U.S. praise for the 
Argentine Army Blue Helmets in Haiti. 
 
 
 
THE TEN AMERICANS ARRESTED IN 
 
HAITI: A TIP CASE? 
 
----------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶5.   Two papers reported on the case of the ten Americans arrested 
in Haiti.  An editorial in daily-of-record La Nacion (2/8) stated, 
"The attempt to get hold of Haitian children with the excuse of 
arranging an adoption unveiled another case of trafficking in 
persons (TIP)."  The editorial claimed that "the children at issue, 
between 2 and 14 years old, were not orphans and some of them even 
begged to be allowed to return with their parents."  It also quoted 
the Haitian authorities, "It was not an adoption attempt but a 
plain case of trafficking or robbery of children."  According to 
centrist Perfil newspaper (2/6), Secretary Hillary Clinton said she 
would not intervene in favor of the ten Americans arrested in 
Haiti.

DEMANDS FOR BILL 
 
CLINTON IN HAITI 
 
---------------- 
 
 
 
¶6.   Perfil, conservative La Prensa, pro-government, left-of-center 
Pagina 12 and state-owned Telam wire service (2/6) reported on 
former President Bill Clinton's visit to Haiti.  Most described 
Haitians "sleeping in the outside," while all reported that 200 
Haitians asked former President Clinton for more tents and 
assistance.
