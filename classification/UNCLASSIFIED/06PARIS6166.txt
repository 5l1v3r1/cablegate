SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION REPORT - GWOT - Latest Al-Qaida Video - 
Turkey - Syria Afghanistan Islam and the West 
Sarkozy to the U.S. 
PARIS - Thursday, September 14, 2006 
 
 
(A) SUBJECTS COVERED IN TODAY'S REPORT: 
 
GWOT - Latest Al-Qaida Video - Turkey - Syria 
Afghanistan 
Islam and the West 
Sarkozy to the U.S. 
 
B) SUMMARY OF COVERAGE: 
 
Le Figaro devotes its front page to the latest Al-Qaida video and 
the call to Islamists to target the French.  According to the 
front-page article, "French intelligence is taking these threats 
very seriously."  (See Part C) Meanwhile the bottom half of Le 
Figaro's front page is devoted to President Chirac's call for a 
"dialogue between cultures" as he denounced the "divorce between the 
West and Islam" in a speech at the Elysee which served to launch 
"cultural workshops" between Europe, the Mediterranean and Gulf 
nations. President Chirac said "that to counter the shock caused by 
ignorance, arrogance and stupidity, we must return to a dialogue." 
Several op-eds and columns in Le Figaro deal with related subjects: 
in the third installment of its post-9/11 series, Amr al-Choubaki, a 
political strategy specialist in Cairo, pens an opinion column 
entitled "The Arabs Want Leaders Who Can Oppose President Bush" in 
which he looks at how 9/11 has changed the Middle East.  (See Part 
C) 
 
Also in Le Figaro Pierre Prier analyzes the changing role of Hamas, 
"now that it plays in political role.  With its decision to get into 
politics, Hamas necessarily had to put religion on a backburner." 
Liberation reports on the call from Palestinian businessmen to the 
political class in order to "avoid economic chaos in Gaza."  In Le 
Fiagro Patrick Saint-Paul writes:  "The U.S. is not totally in favor 
of a Hamas-Fatah coalition and quotes Assistant Secretary David 
Welch:  "We are not aware of all the details of the new government, 
but at first glance, it does not fulfill all the preset 
conditions..."   In his weekly column in Le Figaro Alexandre Adler 
contends that the latest attacks in Turkey and Syria are "unjustly 
penalizing these two countries."  For Adler, the recent attack in 
Damascus was not "a manipulation of Syria's secret service."  As for 
Turkey, Adler believes Europe is responsible for "lighting small 
fires which trigger internal strife, such as including the debate on 
the Armenian genocide in the talks on Turkey's EU membership." (See 
Part C) 
 
Afghanistan is back prominently in the news.  La Croix devotes a 
major interview to General James Jones who says:  "Generations will 
be needed before Afghanistan can be put back on its feet." He 
explains the need additional forces, but notes:  "France has always 
been one of the major NATO contributors in terms of troops and has 
nothing to be ashamed of."  In Le Figaro Alexandrine Bouilhet 
reports that "NATO is increasingly having difficulties finding the 
needed military support." (See Part C) Le Figaro quotes U.S. General 
Mark Kimmit, in charge of strategy and planning for Iraq and 
Afghanistan, in an article entitled: "It Is Not Civil War Yet in 
Iraq" and Liberation reveals that a Frenchman jailed in Iraq for the 
past two years has just been sentenced to serve 15 years "for 
illegal entry into Iraq." 
 
Interior Minister Sarkozy's meeting with President Bush continues to 
elicit commentaries.  The editorial in communist L'Humanite, devoted 
to Sarkozy's trip to the U.S., contends that "his and the U.S. 
President's views on foreign policy converge."  Le Parisien quotes 
Sarkozy's comments on his meeting with President Bush:  "He is a 
straight and loyal guy...  He did not want a diplomatic meeting... 
and was lucid enough to perceive the complication of the 
situation...  What separates him from me?  He was elected President 
twice..."   Le Figaro carries a picture of Sarkozy during his 
meeting with Secretary Rice and entitles its article:  "Sarkozy 
Takes Full Credit for his American Success."  (See Part C)  Le Monde 
comments:  "Sarkozy Aligns with Bush on Middle East" 
 
Liberation reports on its front page "GMO Rice Coming to Us From 
America."  Le Figaro entitles its article: "Modified Rice: 
Industrialists Denounce America's Laxity." 
 
(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
GWOT - Latest Al-Qaida Video - Turkey - Syria 
"Al-Qaida Designates France as a Target" 
Jean Chichizola in right-of-center Le Figaro (09/14):  "The latest 
Al-Qaida video distinctly points to France and points to the GPSC as 
the group which should fight the 'French crusaders...'  The Algerian 
Salafist GSPC is said to have joined the ranks of Al-Qaida and is to 
hit the 'miscreants' who do not 'allow women to wear the veil...' 
France's intelligence services are taking the threats very 
seriously... particularly because UN resolution 1701 on UNIFIL is 
clearly mentioned...  The group, which has lost some of its luster 
in Algeria, has decided to turn to international terrorism and join 
the international Jihad movement.  According to intelligence 
specialists, this gives the group wider propaganda:  the support of 
Ben Laden and Al Zawahiri revamps their image in the eyes 
fundamentalists." 
 
"Turkey and Syria Unjustly Penalized" 
Alexandre Adler in right-of-center Le Figaro (09/14):  "The recent 
attack against the U.S. Embassy in Damascus cannot seriously be 
regarded as the result of manipulation by Syria's secret service... 
Clearly, the intent was to completely destroy the U.S. Embassy and 
to undermine Bashar al-Assad's authority. The grateful and almost 
warm thanks which Secretary Rice sent to Assad is a sign that the 
U.S. has understood the attack is the work of Al-Qaida and that the 
target was more the Syrian regime than the U.S.  Time in Syria is 
now running short and the double tier of power cannot continue 
indefinitely...  In Turkey, what is lighting the fires is Europe's 
hypocritical maneuvering, with a potential for collateral damage the 
EU does not fully measure...  Including the debate on the Armenian 
genocide in the talks on Turkey's EU membership is akin to provoking 
Turkish public opinion and the government...  Has everyone 
understood what Assad and Turkey's isolation can cost us in the 
Middle East crisis?  In this particular instance we are not dealing 
with America's unilateralism but rather with the small-mindedness of 
Europe's bourgeoisie." 
 
Afghanistan 
 
"NATO Hard Pressed to Find Re-enforcements" 
Alexandrine Bouilhet in right-of-center Le Figaro (09/14):  "The 
calls made by General James Jones have remained unanswered... 
Germany and Europe in general have been claiming they cannot send 
troops both to Lebanon and to Southern Afghanistan...  France in 
particular has sent out the message it was overstretched...  But, 
says a French diplomat, 'France cannot be faulted.  It has proved 
its solidarity.'  Despite the need for additional troops, operation 
'Medusa' is registering success." 
 
Islam and the West 
 
"The Arabs Want Leaders Who Can Oppose President Bush" 
Amr al-Choubaki, a political strategy specialist in Cairo, in 
right-of-center Le Figaro (09/14):  "Everyone talks about how 9/11 
has affected the U.S.  But few analyze how the war on terror has 
upset the Middle East.  Has it brought peace and democracy to the 
region?  And if not, is there a chance the next U.S. administration 
will have learned the proper lesson?  One major problem is that the 
U.S. oversimplified the situation, adopting a narrow view of 
terrorism and a simple definition of democracy... thinking it was 
possible to send in new leaders along with troops, both in Iraq and 
Afghanistan...  Democracy requires local governments to implement 
reforms...  In Iraq, the U.S. has practically done the reverse... 
and missed the opportunity to promote democracy...  The situation in 
Iraq stems from America's error, assimilating al-Qaida-led terrorism 
with resistance movements such as Hezbollah, Hamas and Jihad...  The 
U.S. and Israel continue to amalgamate terrorism with resistance... 
forgetting to see the reasons behind resistance movements... Arab 
populations do not want their leaders to obey American orders... 
They want a political class similar to the one emerging in Latin 
America...  The Bush Administration does not want to take into 
account the emotion and political significance of the protest... 
But to gag the protesters is dangerous...  Fortunately, UN 
resolution 1701 does not fully stick to the American-Israeli vision 
of the war against terror...  In the past five years, the Middle 
East has become a high risk region...  Terrorism will end only when 
the root causes are eradicated...  We need an environment in which 
moderate Islam can look at democracy as an ideal and a goal... The 
war against terror has a price which neither the U.S., Israel, Arab 
regimes nor Islamic movements have wanted to pay.   The Arabs need 
to be convinced that victory over terrorism will bring them 
democracy, justice and development." 
 
Sarkozy to the U.S. 
 
"Sarkozy's American Success" 
Judith Waintraub in right-of-center Le Figaro (09/14):  "All summer 
long, Nicolas Sarkozy worked on his English.  One hour everyday... 
and his work paid off.  Almost without any help from the interpreter 
Sarkozy was able to have a discussion with George W. Bush on Tuesday 
at the White House...  Last week, the US Ambassador to France Craig 
¶R. Stapleton met with Nicolas Sarkozy to warn him that the President 
had asked to meet him...  George Bush directly expressed his 
sympathy for his interlocutor praising him for his speech that very 
morning at the Franco-American Foundation...  This meeting marks 
Sarkozy's strategic success as a player on the international 
scene...  Washington has confirmed that if Segolene Royal goes to 
the US she will receive the same treatment and be able to meet with 
President Bush...  If she so wishes." STAPLETON
