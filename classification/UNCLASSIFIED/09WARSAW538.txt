¶3. Begin text of letter: 
 
For all Rroma in Europe and elsewhere, your speech on the 
International Day of the Rroma on April 8th, was received 
with great enthusiasm and pride. 
 
This day has been a turning point in history, for this is the 
first time that Secretary of State of the US Government has 
highlighted the plight and issues faced by Rroma in many 
countries. 
 
We Rroma, as the largest transnational European minority, 
took your speech as a key that opened the prospects of new 
policies on Rroma with Rroma in Europe and other countries. 
 
Your open and direct talk, with the democratic and open 
background of your country gave hope to many Rroma to be able 
to live normal lives amongst the rest of the population. 
 
In the name of the International Rromani Union and all Rroma 
whom we represent, we would like to thank you for this 
intervention and for your engagement to better our lives and 
future. 
 
We would be very happy if we could meet you in person and be 
able to present you our work, which we are currently doing to 
improve the situation and integration of the Rroma minority. 
This would be a great honor and would give us strength in 
continuing and improving our work.  It would also be a signal 
to politicians in all countries, to at long last include 
Rroma in the democratic processes and societies of their own 
countries. 
 
Once more, many thanks for your engagement and intervention, 
which showed insights and a depth of knowledge of the 
situation of this transnational minority, something we have 
until now not been used to.  In the name of all Rroma, thank 
you.
