SUBJECT: Corruption in Afghanistan:  Karzai versus Khalilzad 
 
¶1.  The popular Tolo TV News Special, "Guzaresh-e-Shashunim, 6:30 
Report" focused on recent comments by President Karzai and 
Ambassador Khalilzad on corruption in Afghanistan.  The program, 
which aired on [DATE], led with Khalilzad's statement that 
corruption in the Karzai government was detrimental to progress in 
Afghanistan.  It followed with Karzai's recent comments at the 
conference for Community Development Councils, in which he admitted 
that corruption was a problem in his administration, and called on 
government officials to serve the Afghan people and not themselves. 
Panelists praised Khalilzad and Karzai for raising the issue in 
public fora, but encouraged Karzai to take specific action, rather 
than complain about it. 
 
¶2.  Panelists stated that Karzai is not able to manage internal 
pressures within his administration, is not accountable to the 
people and is not implementing parliament's decisions.  They also 
commented that corruption was contributing to the government's 
increasing weakness and unpopularity, and they were grateful that 
Khalilzad raised the issue at the international level.  They also 
praised Karzai for admitting to the corruption problem, but urged 
him to name the corrupt officials in his government and to take 
action against them.  Panelists stated that Khalilzad's comments 
were an indirect criticism by the U.S. government, which should send 
Karzai a message about the scope of the corruption problem.  The 
Tolo TV presenter also speculated about unconfirmed media reports 
that Karzai would call an emergency Loya Jirga and hand over the 
power to the people's representatives. 
 
¶3.  Panelists on the program included Dr. Muhaiuddin Mahdi, a 
political analyst; Noorulhaq Uloomi, a member of parliament from 
Kandahar Province and former military  officer during the communist 
regime; Moin Marasteyal, a member of parliament from Kunduz 
Province;  Nasrullah Stanikzai, a Kabul University law professor; 
and Najib Mahmood, a Kabul University political science  professor.
