SUBJECT: BRAZIL - RATIFYING THE 1999 MONTREAL CONVENTION 
 
REF: STATE 22032 
 
Emboff made reftel points on adherence to the 1999 Montreal 
Convention to Michel Arslanian of the Foreign Ministry's 
Office for Services, Investment and Finance.  Arslanian 
deals with Aviation issues, including the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).  Arslanian said the GoB 
takes this issue seriously, has signed the Convention and 
submitted it to Congress for ratification.  It is currently 
pending action in the Chamber of Deputies, where a Deputy 
from the governing PT party has been assigned as rapporteur. 
Arslanian was unable, however, to predict when the Congress 
might ratify the convention.
