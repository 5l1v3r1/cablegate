NOMINATING-OFFICER: Pol/Econ Janice Weiner 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
This nomination supports the post's goal of protecting 
critical infrastructure and secure and stable markets. 
Stephen Laskowski is following in the footsteps of Ontario 
Trucking Association president David Bradley, who has become 
a master at understanding and - in the correct fora - 
articulating the border and transportation interests of the 
trucking community, which moves so much of North America's 
trade.  It is essential that this indispensable cog in our 
trade have a full understanding, not only of how to partner 
and converse with various levels of government and business 
on the Canadian side, but on the U.S. side as well. 
Laskowski would benefit from meetings with DHS, to better 
understand how the various border programs work and are 
intended to work; with state departments of transportation, 
not only in neighboring states, where contacts likely 
already exist, but in other border states, such as 
Washington State, California or Texas, to learn how others 
deal with border issues; with members of Congress or 
staffers to open a dialogue on border issues; and with city 
governments that have dealt with knotty traffic problems. 
It would give Laskowski, i.a., a greater understanding of 
how security and efficient trade can be balanced, and help 
him put the security aspect into its proper perspective.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: CG Arreaga, PA Hillman and Eng 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Rob Kroeker, who works in the British Columbia Ministry of 
the Solicitor General as director of commercial vehicle 
safety, has a background in law, criminology and 
transportation.  The post nominates him for an IVL program 
that explores ground transportation policy at the local, 
state, and federal level in the U.S. as well as at the U.S.- 
Canada bilateral level and NAFTA international level. 
Mr. Kroeker sits on the Canadian Council of Motor Transport 
Administrators, which is the body with federal, provincial 
and territorial representatives who coordinate all matters 
regarding administration, regulation and control of motor 
vehicle transportation. This would include transport of 
hazardous goods and transport strategies. 
Mr. Kroeker envisions his future as an assistant or deputy 
minister dealing with transport.  He is very interested in 
learning more about the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration, meeting state counterparts in commercial 
transportation and law enforcement, and organizations 
dealing with security and safety. Better knowledge of the 
U.S. side of commercial ground transportation would assist 
him (and Canada) to better harmonize transport rules which 
he says can be quite divergent. Some examples in which  U.S. 
and Canada regulations differ include hours of service 
(hours a trucker can be on the road), safety inspection 
criteria, and border rules. He would like to see what 
directions are being taken for common rules applying to 
NAFTA, anticipating more tri-country trade in the future. 
Mr. Kroeker presently does not have any contacts at the U.S. 
federal and state levels of government. An IVL program for 
Mr. Kroeker would be a useful means of opening 
communications between our two countries in regards to 
commercial ground transportation. 
The president of the B.C. Trucking Association speaks very 
highly of Mr. Kroeker and believes he has a bright future in 
government. With a Bachelors Degree in criminology, a law 
degree and a Masters Degree in public administration, Mr. 
Kroeker has a solid foundation to be effective in his future 
work, and in cooperating with American neighbors to ensure 
secure and smooth border crossings.
