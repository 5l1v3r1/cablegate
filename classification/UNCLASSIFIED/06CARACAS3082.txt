accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On October 10, Econoffs met with the 
president and representatives of the National Civil Aviation 
Institute (INAC) to discuss various pending aviation issues. 
The group discussed formalizing a Federal Air Marshals 
program in Venezuela, rumors about Caracas-Tehran-Damascus 
flights, Venezuela's bilateral aviation agreements, reaching 
out to Boeing, visa issues and the status of Venezuelan 
carriers' request to fly to the U.S. with their own aircraft. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------- 
Federal Air Marshals 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 10, EconCouns and EconOff met with a team 
from Venezuela's Civil Aviation Institute (INAC), including 
its president, Col. Francisco Paz Fleitas.  Over the last two 
years, Post has sent three diplomatic notes asking the BRV to 
formally allow Federal Air Marshals (FAMS) to board flights 
to/from Venezuela, but has received no response.  (Note: FAMS 
operated in Venezuela in the past, under an informal 
agreement with the BRV.  End Note).  INAC's legal counsel 
explained that Venezuelan law strictly prohibited carrying 
weapons on board an aircraft without a permit, which is only 
granted in very exceptional circumstances.  Paz Fleitas said 
that INAC would study ICAO guidelines to see if Venezuela 
could revise internal regulations and adopt the program, and 
agreed that it was important to cooperate on aviation 
security.  EconCouns noted that the Transportation Security 
Agency (TSA) would be willing to send down an expert to 
explain the program's details.  Paz Fleitas said he would 
study the issue, and would prepare a written response.

Iran and Syria 
-------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) During Iranian President Ahmadinejad's visit in 
September, the state-owned carrier, Conviasa, and Air Iran 
signed a code share agreement to operate flights between 
Caracas and Tehran.  During an October 7 tourism fair in 
Caracas, EconOff spoke to an Iran Air representative who said 
that the flight would be operative in November.  EconOff 
asked INAC's representatives if these routes were indeed 
going to operate next month.  They chuckled and said they had 
not received any formal request from the airline and that the 
timeline was unrealistic. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Freddy Charris, INAC's Economics and Statistics 
Manager, confirmed that there are no current Caracas-Tehran 
or Caracas-Damascus routes, and again debunked press reports 
these routes could be approved within the calendar year. 
INAC officials noted that as Conviasa didn't have aircraft 
capable of operating such a distance, the code-share would 
likely be on an Iran Air aircraft.  Charris said the BRV is 
negotiating a number of bilateral aviation agreements with 
countries in the middle east, including Iran, Syria, Qatar, 
and the United Arab Emirates. 
 
---------------------------- 
Getting cozier with the U.S. 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) David Isea, INAC's General Security Manager, 
outlined the BRV's desire to do more business with Boeing, 
and develop Venezuela as a strong market.  He outlined INAC's 
"transformational plan" to turn Venezuelan air services into 
 
CARACAS 00003082  002 OF 002 
 
 
a full-blown industry, and asked for assistance in reaching 
out further to Boeing.  Isea mentioned that Venezuelan 
carriers had attempted to negotiate wet-leased aircraft from 
U.S. companies but had been turned down (presumably because 
the carrier was Venezuelan).  (Note: Wet-lease companies' 
reticence to operate in Venezuela likely stems from 
difficulties in obtaining U.S. dollars from the Foreign 
Exchange Board (CADIVI) to pay for air services.  End Note.) 
 
¶6. (SBU) Isea also emphasized the continuing need for INAC 
representatives to travel to the United States, both to 
secure the relationship with Boeing and for inspector 
training.  He expressed frustration with the limited validity 
of the visas issued for this purpose, and the need for a new 
diplomatic note each time a visa was requested.  EconOff 
explained that our policy had come to this due to 
reciprocity, and that Post had approached the Ministry of 
External Relations (MRE) repeatedly on the broader 
reciprocity issue.  INAC's representatives understood, and 
expressed frustration with the MRE's position and their 
inefficiency when issuing diplomatic notes for INAC travel. 
 
¶7. (SBU) INAC's representatives did not inquire expressly 
about Venezuelan carriers' requests to fly their own aircraft 
and crews to the United States following Venezuela's upgrade 
to Category 1 earlier this year.  However, when the issue 
arose later in the meeting, they were pleased to hear that 
Aeropostal's application was progressing and that the airline 
would likely be notified soon on the request.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶8. (SBU)  Unlike the last formal meeting with INAC (over the 
Category 1 issue), this meeting's tone was positive and 
collegial.  Charris asked that we establish a working level 
dialogue and communicate openly about aviation issues.  INAC 
is keeping aviation issues at a technical level, it seems, 
and while the BRV is certainly developing relationships 
across the globe, INAC is not shying away from the U.S. 
market or U.S. providers.  Post will seek to maintain this 
dialogue with INAC.  End comment.
