On December 16, Poloff spoke to Czech Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) Iraq desk officer Pavel Mrazek regarding ref A 
request seeking public support for the December 15 Iraq 
election.  Mrazek provided the following text of a statement 
that the MFA issued that day and has posted on its website: 
"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) of the Czech Republic 
congratulates the Iraqi people and the Iraqi government on 
the successful accomplishment of Parliamentary elections on 
15th December 2005.  The MFA of the CR appreciated especially 
the high number of voters from all ethnic and religious 
groups of the Iraqi society.  The high number of voters in 
the Parliamentary elections gives the Parliament and the 
Government, which will lead Iraq in the next four years, a 
strong mandate which cannot be put in doubt.  The 
Parliamentary elections are a crucial step of Iraq on the way 
to democracy, stability and prosperity.  The Czech MFA is 
convinced that this way will lead to success. Iraqis 
confirmed by their participation in particularly high 
numbers, despite a difficult security situation, that they 
are determined to build a democratic society in their 
country.  The Czech Republic is determined to continue, 
together with the international community, to provide aid to 
Iraqi people in their effort to build a democratic and 
prosperous nation."
