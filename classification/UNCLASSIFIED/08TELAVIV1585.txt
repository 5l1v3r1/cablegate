SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT: 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  Mideast 
 
¶2.  Iran 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media reported that a Palestinian terrorist from East Jerusalem, 
Ghassan Abu-Tir, went on a rampage with a bulldozer in central 
Jerusalem.  One of his relatives is senior Hamas member Mohammed 
Abu-Tir.  Twenty four Israeli civilians were injured, one seriously, 
before the driver was shot and killed by a Border Police officer and 
a civilian.  The attack occurred close to 2 P.M., near the King 
David Hotel, where Barack Obama stayed Tuesday night.  The media 
reported that Israeli authorities are keen to expedite procedures 
that would authorize the resumption of punitive measures, such as 
the razing of terrorists' homes.  Leading media reported that a 
group of yeshiva students assaulted two East Jerusalem 
Palestinians. 
 
Major media reported that speaking at a gathering of activists at 
the Kadima branch in Hadera, FM Tzipi Livni declared yesterday that 
after winning the race for Kadima chair, she will immediately work 
to form a national unity government with Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu 
and Labor's Ehud Barak.  She promised there would be room for 
members from Meretz to Yisrael Beiteinu. 
 
Maariv reported that Israel is considering releasing Fatah/Tanzim 
leader Marwan Barghouti before the release of Gilad Shalit.  The 
newspaper reported that the freeing of Barghouti would be presented 
as a gesture to PA President Mahmoud Abbas, in order to strengthen 
the PA and moderate Palestinian elements, and thwart Hamas's 
intention to claim Barghouti's release as its own. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that this morning the diplomatic-security cabinet 
will discuss the threat of global jihad on Israel, the first time 
the Olmert cabinet has debated this issue thoroughly.  The ministers 
will hear reports from Mossad, Shin Bet, and IDF Intelligence 
focusing on Al-Qaida and affiliated cells operating against Israeli 
targets and Jewish targets around the world. 
 
Maariv reported that at his meting with President Shimon Peres 
yesterday, President Abbas conveyed a message of peace, agreeing 
that Shalit should be released.  Peres was quoted as saying that 
Abbas is a "man of peace."  The Jerusalem Post quoted Abbas as 
saying that the Palestinians were troubled by Israeli activity in 
the territories, and that it was time to complete negotiations on 
Jerusalem, settlements, water, and the refugee situation. 
 
Israel Radio reported that yesterday UN Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon released details of a letter he received from Hizbullah 
leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who outlined his group's conditions 
for further prisoner deals with Israel.  Israel is due to release 
Palestinian prisoners in the future, at its own discretion, as a 
gesture to Ban.  The radio quoted Nasrallah as saying that he is 
willing to provide information and humanitarian "aid" connected with 
Israeli soldiers who have been missing since the 1980s.  Israel 
Radio said that Nasrallah demanded that Israel release the highest 
possible number of minors, women and elderly Palestinians from 
Israeli jails in the framework of the exchange deal with his 
organization. 
 
Yediot disclosed transcripts of the main police probe of Attorney 
Uri Messer, a former associate of PM Ehud Olmert.  Messer reportedly 
said that Olmert knew that he was keeping money for him and that the 
funds were not meant for election purposes.  Media reported that 
yesterday a video recording of Talansky's police investigation 
screened during his cross-examination showed that he claimed to have 
given money to the late PM Yitzhak Rabin. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that for the second time this year, 
Israel has decided to act against Aljazeera-TV,  after Al-Jazeera-TV 
held a party for released Lebanese child-killer Samir Kuntar, the 
Government Press Office said it would impose sanctions and demand an 
explanation from the station. 
 
All media reported that a rally to support Shalit's release, which 
was attended by thousands, was held in Rabin Square in Tel Aviv last 
night.  Shalit's comrades-in-arms initiated the event. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that a bill that could force the 
Interior Ministry to continue evaluating the rights of some 10,000 
Falash Mura -- Ethiopians whose Jewish ancestors converted to 
Christianity -- to immigrate to Israel will be presented to the 
Knesset plenum for a preliminary reading today.  Lawmakers and 
advocates hope the move will prompt the government to reverse its 
policy on the matter. 
 
Major media reported that today Likud MK Gilad Erdan will introduce 
a bill forcing judges to ban publications in the media.  Prominent 
journalists and legal experts protested against the proposed 
legislation. 
 
All media reported that Israel's most comprehensive environmental 
legislation to day, the Clean Air Act, passed into law yesterday.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote on page one of the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz: "Israelis don't interest McCain 
and Obama.  Rather, it is their Jewish voters and contributors at 
home." 
 
Former Labor Knesset Member and former cabinet minister Uzi Baram 
wrote in the independent Israel Hayom: "We need a [U.S.] president 
who will combat the settlements, which endanger any solution, but 
who would also show a deep commitment to an Israel that is marching 
towards an agreement with its neighbors." 
 
Military correspondent Alex Fishman wrote in the mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot: "A new Intifada breaks out without anyone 
planning it.  Afterwards, with hindsight, people will characterize 
it and find motives and historical processes for it.... [But] things 
should be called by their name: There is weakness of will here and 
weakness of government." 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: "What 
[the Israeli government] must not do is cave in to populist 
sentiment, throw open the prison gates, and let legions of 
terrorists out to wreak more bloody havoc."

¶I.  "Just a Sideshow" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote on page one of the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz (7/23): "Israelis don't interest 
McCain and Obama.  Rather, it is their Jewish voters and 
contributors at home.... [But] to the Israeli establishment, McCain 
seems like the natural choice.  With his white hair, expression 
lines and combat experience, he embodies the Israeli concept of 
leadership -- a kind of American version of Yitzhak Rabin or Ariel 
Sharon.  If McCain continues Bush's policies, Israel will benefit 
from the term of another U.S. president who understands its needs. 
Obama represents an exciting option, albeit a more dangerous one: If 
he manages to rehabilitate America's international stature, reduce 
its dependence on oil and push through peace between Israel and the 
Arabs, Israel's strategic situation will improve dramatically.  But 
on the way, he might have to pressure Israel.  If he fails, Israel 
will have to pay the price without reaping any returns.... An even 
more worrisome clause on Obama's agenda is his embracing the 
initiative for global nuclear disarmament.... Those worried might 
see the budding of a deal: Natanz for Dimona.  Israel will certainly 
bring all its influence to bear in the U.S. to thwart it." 
 
II.  "No Need to Fear Obama" 
 
Former Labor Knesset Member and former cabinet minister Uzi Baram 
wrote in the independent Israel Hayom (7/23): "It is Obama who is 
likely to form a unified front against Islamic fundamentalist 
extremism, by continuous dialogue with different countries in Europe 
and the Middle East.... As for Israel, Obama will be a friend, 
simply because no American president can behave otherwise.... We 
need a president who can create a different atmosphere which will 
grant, together with its ally Europe, economic guarantees, and a 
policy favoring the axis of states which would prefer peace with 
Israel.  We need a president who will combat the settlements, which 
endanger any solution, but who would also show a deep commitment to 
an Israel that is marching towards an agreement with its 
neighbors.....  And what about the planes, that according to all the 
news media, are on their future way to Iran?  In all probability 
they will never make the trip.  A different American 
commander-in-chief will know how to extinguish the torches in 
another way, before the planes set out for their targets. 
 
III.  "Signs of an Intifada" 
 
Military correspondent Alex Fishman wrote in the mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (7/23): "The first Intifada, in the late 
1980s, also started this way, in a series of unexplained incidents, 
unconnected to terror organizations, phenomena of 'spontaneous 
violence'.... 'Atmospheric terror attacks,' it was called on our 
side, and officials insisted that these were people with 
psychological problems, incited, influenced by religious 
extremism.... There is a link between all the 'atmospheric terror 
attacks' that have been taking place right before our eyes, between 
all the Qmad bulldozer operators.Q  This link has a name: Weakness 
of government.  From here, the deterioration is inevitable, because 
weakness of government and inability to enforce [the law] lead to 
lack of deterrence, criminal activity and anarchy.... Today one no 
longer has to go to the mosque in order to inject the poison into 
one's veins.   The mosque arrives at the person's home -- via the 
Internet.... One isolated incident after another create a sequence 
and an atmosphere, particularly in Jerusalem.  For Jewish extremists 
this is grounds for acts of revenge, and so a new Intifada breaks 
out without anyone planning it.  Afterwards, with hindsight, people 
will characterize it and find motives and historical processes for 
it.  But there is no new historical process here.  Things should be 
called by their name: There is weakness of will here and weakness of 
government." 
 
IV.  "Not at Any Price" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (7/23): 
"The emotional blackmail, media frenzy, and leadership vacuum that 
set Samir Kuntar free now threaten to unleash an even greater 
'prison escape.'  Hamas is demanding 1,000 terrorists, including the 
masterminds and facilitators of some of the most heinous bloodbaths 
of the second Intifada -- including the Dolphinarium, Sbarro, and 
Netanya Seder massacres.  The expertise these luminaries of the 
Palestinian 'resistance' could provide in a third Intifada is too 
frightening to contemplate.... The strategic challenge the 
government of Israel faces is not Hamas's custody of Cpl. Shalit, 
but its suzerainty over Gaza.  Of course Israel must strive to bring 
Shalit home, but not at any cost.  For instance, Israel could 
reasonably offer to trade for its IDF captive the Hamas 
'parliamentarians' it took into custody within days of Shalit's 
capture.  The government could also debate Knesset Member Avigdor 
Lieberman's proposal to capture the most senior Hamas leaders in 
Gaza to use as fresh bargaining chips.  Or it could weigh a rescue 
attempt.  What it must not do is cave in to populist sentiment, 
throw open the prison gates, and let legions of terrorists out to 
wreak more bloody havoc."

¶2.  Iran: 
--------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Transportation Minister Shaul Mofaz "addressed" Barack Obama in the 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post: "As someone who was born 
and spent his childhood in Iran, I know the Iranian people very 
well.   I can tell you that they are a people who support peace. 
Their problem is their leadership, which misuses Islam and turns it 
into an extreme message of hate."

"An Open Letter to Senator Obama" 
 
Transportation Minister Shaul Mofaz "addressed" Barack Obama in the 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (7/23): "The consistent 
language of the Iranian President and the arrogant words of 
Hizbullah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah prove that today, as 
before, there are those who wish for the total annihilation of the 
Jewish people, and work day and night to achieve that goal.   To us 
this is very clear, and we hope the rest of the world sees it with 
the same clarity.   As someone who was born and spent his childhood 
in Iran, I know the Iranian people very well.   I can tell you that 
they are a people who support peace.   Their problem is their 
leadership, which misuses Islam and turns it into an extreme message 
of hate and violence, assisting every worthless, negative player in 
the region.   Having dedicated the past 40 years of my life to 
Israel's security and defense, and as someone who is very well 
acquainted with the regional system, I can tell you that the only 
language that can be used in this case is the language of strength.
