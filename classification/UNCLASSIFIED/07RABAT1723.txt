According to Rabat LEGAT, the UN General Assembly in 
Marrakech voted on 7 November in favor of issuing Red Notices 
to the Iranian individuals in connection to the AMIA bombing 
(reftels).  Seventy countries voted in favor of issuance, 14 
opposed the issuance, and 26 formally abstained.  Prior to 
the vote, Iran presented oral arguments for 20 minutes and 
Argentina for 5 minutes.  The successful vote means that the 
Red Notices against the individuals can be issued at any time.
