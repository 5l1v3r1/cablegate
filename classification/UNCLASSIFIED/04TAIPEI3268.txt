In response to AIT's July 7, 2004 delivery of Reftel A 
demarche, Tsay Tzu-yaw, Director of Taiwan Fisheries Deep 
Seas Fisheries Division told AIT that the Taiwan Authorities 
revoked Mr. Chen's (the vessel Master/Chief Engineer) fishing 
permit in July and forwarded the case to the Kaohsiung 
District Court for prosecution.  AIT followed up on the case 
on October 12 and further learned that the vessel's Georgian 
registration expired on October 30, 2003. Taiwan Fisheries is 
unaware if the registration was renewed and/or extended. 
Taiwan Fisheries Agency (TFA) has requested any detailed 
documents and materials that may have been obtained during 
the Japanese boarding and inspection. TFA is particularly 
interested in any documents that describe fishing activities 
and/or that confirm Mr. Chen's involvement. TFA has 
specifically requested copies of "licenses of Chun Jin No.1, 
and certificates of these fishing crews."  Regarding other 
vessels operating in the same area during the April to 
October time frame, TFA indicated that it only permitted 
eight "squid-jigging fishing vessels" to operate between 
N42-43 and E170-175 during that time frame.
