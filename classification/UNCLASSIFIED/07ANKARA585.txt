In Today's Papers 
 
Detention of Kurdish DTP Members Continues 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others report 
Ferhan Turk, the head of the pro-Kurdish party DTP in Mardin 
province, was detained for "praising a criminal" after referring to 
the PKK's imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan as "sayin," which means, 
roughly, "esteemed" in English.  The DTP leader Ahmet Turk recently 
received a six-month prison sentence for using the same word to 
refer to Ocalan.  In the western port city of Izmir, 13 DTP members 
were detained yesterday under the same charge. 
 
 
Meanwhile, the Turkish anti-terror supreme board, convening under 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul on Tuesday, discussed the efforts to 
fight against terrorism and the measures to be taken before the 
upcoming Nevruz celebrations in southeast Turkey. 
 
Center-Right Parties' "Election Alliance," Agar on Southeast 
Question 
All papers point to ongoing efforts to form an election alliance 
between center-right parties in Turkey, reporting former Prime 
Minister Mesut Yilmaz met with Mehmet Agar, leader of the 
centre-right True Path Party (DYP).  Agar told the press he would 
meet with all who have the knowledge and experience in Turkish 
politics, stressing, however, that the "venue" of any merger should 
be DYP.  Yilmaz favors unity among center-right parties, supported 
by former president Suleyman Demirel as well as veteran figures from 
DYP and the Motherland Party (ANAP) according to papers.  ANAP 
leader Erkan Mumcu, however, said his party was not interested in 
uniting with other parties. 
 
Papers also report Agar as saying top Turkish officials' 
contradicting statements on Iraq caused concern among the nation. 
Responding to CHP leader Baykal's criticism about Agar's earlier 
statements with regard to the southeast question, the DYP leader 
said, "Contrary to Baykal's charge, I'm not trying to give away 
Diyarbakir, but I am trying to take Mosul." 
 
Ankara Doesn't Want Missile Shield 
Radikal, Cumhuriyet:  Turkey does not share the NATO 
Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer's proposal that the US 
 
SIPDIS 
proposed missile defense program should cover southern Europe as 
well as eastern Europe, including Turkey.  Responding to a question 
on this issue yesterday, Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul was quoted as 
saying that "We are not involved in this project.  We use our own 
national resources and our own tenders to meet our air defense 
needs." 
 
US Initiative on Armenian Resolution 
All papers report that US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and 
Defense Secretary Robert Gates sent a joint letter to the House 
leaders underlining serious difficulties that passage of an Armenian 
genocide draft resolution would cause, describing how Turkish-US 
relations would be damaged and US interests would be hurt. 
 
Meanwhile, Milliyet, Sabah and others report that in an interview 
with Reuters, Turkish Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee chairman 
Mehmet Dulger said that if Armenian resolution is issued by the US 
Congress, then Turkey may introduce restrictions to the US use of 
Incirlik Air Base.  Dulger added that the resolution would seriously 
damage Turkish-US relations and that the Turkish parliament would 
define the issue as a "hostile act." 
 
Editorial Commentary on Possible Turkish Intervention in Northern 
Iraq 
Cuneyt Ulsever observes in the mainstream daily Hurriyet:  "Defining 
Turkey's Iraq policy is a difficult task.  Turkey, on one hand, 
expresses respect for the territorial integrity of Iraq as well as 
its constitution.  On the other hand, however, Turkey also expresses 
 
ANKARA 00000585  002 OF 003 
 
 
its intent to conduct a cross border operation into northern Iraq. 
The contradiction is not limited to the government.  The main 
Turkish opposition party proudly stood against permission for 
American troops to pass through Turkey during the March 1 [2003] 
parliamentary talks, yet the same opposition is now talking about 
sending Turkish troops into Northern Iraq.  Another opposition 
party, DYP, used to talk about paving the way for PKK members to 
enter into politics.  The very same DYP is now talking about 
expanding Turkey toward Mosul.  It seems the Turkish opposition is 
sacrificing Iraq and the Kurdish issue to the rising tide of 
nationalism." 
 
Fikret Bila comments in the mainstream daily Milliyet:  "Turkey's 
possible military intervention into Northern Iraq has become a 
platform for a duel of words between the US and Turkey.  First of 
all, there is a difference in terminology.  'Military intervention' 
is a broader concept, while an 'operation' is narrow and targeted. 
The most recent statement on this came from the Turkish military 
when the Land Forces Commander talked about taking measures against 
the terrorist net in Northern Iraq if there is a military need. 
This statement clearly indicates that in an operation shall be 
considered through the military perspective and not for political 
purposes.  In response to statements of this nature, the US 
generally comes up with an answer expressing opposition to a 
military operation in Northern Iraq.  Tom Casey for instance made a 
similar statement a few days ago, and interestingly enough he 
underlined the US position as a strong commitment to Iraq's 
territorial integrity.  This is exactly the reflection of Turkey's 
Iraq policy from the very beginning.  It is unrealistic to imply 
that a military operation by Turkey aims at dividing Iraq.  It 
should have been very clear by now that Turkey is opposed to a 
division of Iraq -- even more than the US is.  What Turkey means is 
a limited military operation in the fight against terrorism.  For 
some reason, the US administration spokesmen either do not 
understand it, or do not want to understand it that way."
