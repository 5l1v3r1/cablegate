"It's Better to Talk than to Fight" 
 
 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (10-24) by columnist Clovis 
Rossi says: "All the analyses that had indicated a road to 
collision between Iran and the West began to dry up in half a dozen 
days, after 30 years of estrangement....things are moving 
forward.....It seems clear that what President Barack Obama calls 
his engagement policy is working.....It is obvious, nothing has 
been resolved.  But things are better today than they were one 
month ago."
