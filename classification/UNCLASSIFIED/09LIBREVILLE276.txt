Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) The post-Omar Bongo era has begun.  Prime Minister 
Eyeghe Ndong returned to Libreville from Barcelona to push 
along the constitutionally-mandated succession process. 
Following the articles of succession in the constitution, the 
Council of Ministers unanimously voted to refer the question 
of vacancy in the Presidency to the Constitutional Court. 
Defense Minister Ali Ben Bongo remains in poor health, but 
involved in &cabinet-level8 meetings.  Libreville is calm, 
with many Gabonese deciding to stay at home.  The airport is 
open, and no curfew is in effect.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Constitutional Succession Process Begun 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Prime Minister Jean Eyeghe Ndong returned from 
Barcelona today and has taken ad-hoc leadership of the 
government.  The Prime Minister launched the 
constitutionally-mandated succession process by convening the 
Council of Ministers.  In the afternoon the Ministers of 
Gabon, lead by the Prime Minister, unanimously voted to refer 
the issue of succession to the Constitutional Court.  There 
have been multiple statements supporting the rule of law and 
constitution.  Defense Minister Ali Ben Bongo, Minister of 
Communication Laure Olga Gondjaut, and Minister of the 
Interior Andre Mba Obame all made statements in public 
support of the constitution.   During a local TV report on 
the Council of Ministers meeting, the narrator noted that 
Gabon was the &political exception in a region of violence8 
and the country,s laws would be respected. 
 
¶3. (U) The Constitutional Court is expected to declare the 
Presidency vacant, which will officially transfer limited 
powers of the Presidency to the President of the Senate, Rose 
Francine Rogombe.  Rogombe then has up to 45 days to organize 
an election to fill the Presidency.  The Court has 
deliberated questions concerning previous legislative and 
presidential election results. 
 
¶4. (U) Defense Minster Ali Ben Bongo, who is also the son of 
deceased President Omar Bongo, is in Libreville.  However, 
his level of political activity has been subdued over the 
last month due to an unspecified intestinal illness.  Ali Ben 
Bongo did appear on Gabonese TV in the evening of June 8 to 
call for calm and reiterate that the borders were closed and 
the military was on alert.  Ali Ben Bongo looked ill and to 
have lost weight in his recent television appearances. 
 
¶5. (U) Cabinet Secretary Pascaline Bongo, daughter of the 
deceased president, remains in Barcelona.  Family members are 
expected to return to Libreville with the President's body on 
June 12.

The Funeral 
----------- 
 
¶6. (U) The Embassy received a Dipnote on June 9 regarding the 
funeral arrangements.  The Government of Gabon announced that 
the funeral will occur on June 16.  They have requested that 
delegations be limited to 15 people and that the delegations 
arrive and depart the day of the funeral. 
 
---------------------------- 
Security Situation is Stable 
---------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) Libreville is calm as the city respects the first day 
of a 30-day mourning period.  There is a slight increase in 
police and para-military gendarmerie on the streets.  There 
are no reported protests or political gatherings. 
 
¶8. (U) There is no curfew in Gabon, despite rumors on June 8. 
 Many local residents chose to stay home today.  Public and 
most private schools were open.  However, due to a 
contuinuing pay dispute between the government and teachers, 
there were no teachers available (and it is unlikely there 
would have been even without the death of President Bongo).

¶9. (U) The government of nearby Sao Tome and Principe 
announced a 3-day mourning period.  There is no change to 
daily life. 
 
---------------------------- 
Cross-Border Traffic Resumes 
---------------------------- 
 
¶10. (U) Embassy Contacts in the Gabonese Department for 
Customs and Immigration tell us that the borders and airport 
have reopened.  Officials with Air France and Gabon Airlines 
say they expect to resume normal operations by June 10. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶11. (U) The question of "who's in charge" has been answered 
for the time being with the return of the Prime Minister and 
other cabinet-level officials.  Much effort appears to have 
been made to demonstrate that Gabon is still functioning, and 
that a constitutional process is underway and being respected 
by major players in Gabon's political scene.
