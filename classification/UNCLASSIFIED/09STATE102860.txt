SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050192019 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests AIT Taipei's assistance in 
conducting a pre-license check on application 050192019 for 
the export of gyroscopes to Taiwan.  AIT Taipei is requested 
to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  sensitive commodity, lack of 
documentation from end-user Chung Shan Institute of Science 
and Technology (CSIST), and unfamiliar foreign consignee, 
Pegasus Hi-Tek Co., Ltd. (Pegasus).  The company has appeared 
on previous licenses but its bona fides have not been 
 
verified by a Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION AIT TAIPEI:  AIT Taipei is requested to make 
inquiries with appropriate authorities to determine if CSIST 
ordered the gyroscopes from Pegasus and if so, verify the 
amount and that the items will be used for the purpose stated 
on the license.  PM/DTCC also requests that post conduct a 
site visit to Pegasus in order to provide Department with an 
assessment of its business operations and on-site security. 
Finally, post is asked to assess whether the company appears 
to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  If a site visit is 
not possible, please inform the PM/DTCC officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have supporting documentation for this 
proposed transaction? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for this USML item? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer and re-export? 
END ACTION
