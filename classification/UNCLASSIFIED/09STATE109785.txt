¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050117142 for the export of 
International Traffic in Arms (ITAR)-controlled tachometers 
to Germany.  Post is requested to complete this Blue Lantern 
inquiry within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern 
inquiry will affect pending and future licenses involving 
parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: End-Use Statement provided by foreign 
consignee ILS GmbH (ILS) states that the tachometers will be 
needed for the Sealynx helicopter, operated by the German Air 
Force.  The Department is aware that the Sealynx is in the 
inventory of the German Navy. However, the Department is not 
aware that the Sealynx is in the inventory of the German Air 
Force. 
 
¶4. ACTION: The Department requests that Post make inquiries 
to determine if the Germany Ministry of Defense received the 
tachometers and which military branch they were provided to. 
 
END ACTION.
