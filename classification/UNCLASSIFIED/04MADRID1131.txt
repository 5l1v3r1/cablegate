SUBJECT: PROPOSED PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT - SPAIN 
 
 
¶1. Summary: Below is the text of a proposed public 
announcement for Spain.  The EAC met today and 
determined that an updated Public Announcement was 
warranted in light of the discovery of a bomb on the 
rail line used by the high speed train connecting 
Madrid and Seville earlier today.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. Begin Text of Public Announcement: 
 
This Public Announcement is being issued to update U.S. 
citizens on the situation in Spain. It will expire on 
July 2, 2004. 
On April 2, 2004, railroad authorities and the Spanish 
Civil Guard discovered a ten-kilo bomb on the train 
tracks between Seville and Madrid on the high speed 
"AVE" train line. 
A series of bombs were detonated on commuter trains in 
the Madrid area and at the Atocha station on Thursday, 
March 11, 2004, resulting in many deaths and injuries. 
At least three Americans were among the injured. In 
December 2003 and February 2004, Spanish authorities 
thwarted other potential attacks by intercepting 
explosives and apprehending suspects believed to be 
targeting Spanish transportation lines. 
These recent terrorist incidents involving threats to 
public transportation, specifically railroads, indicate 
the need for U.S. citizens in Spain to remain alert and 
to exercise special caution in using these public 
transportation services. 
Americans living in Spain, and those contemplating 
travel to Spain, should review the Consular Information 
Sheet for Spain and Andorra and review the Worldwide 
Caution of March 23, 2004, at http://travel.state.gov 
or at the U.S. Embassy website on http://www.embusa.es 
and monitor news broadcasts. Callers in the United 
States and Canada may reach the U.S. State Department, 
Office of Overseas Citizens Services at 1-888-407-4747 
or from outside the US and Canada call 317-472-2328.
