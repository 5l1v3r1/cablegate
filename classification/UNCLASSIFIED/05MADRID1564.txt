Poloff delivered reftel points on April 12 to Carlos Morales 
Sanchez, Subdirector General for Continental Asia, at the 
Spanish MFA.  On April 22, Poloff received a response from 
Morales Sanchez.  Morales Sanchez said that the Spanish 
government will make a national contribution in support of 
Afghanistan's national parliamentary elections, but that the 
government has not yet determined the amount of the 
contribution.  He said that the issue was currently being 
studied by the Agency for Cooperation, the Spanish version of 
USAID.  Morales Sanchez further stressed Spain's commitment 
to the democratic process in Afghanistan, citing its past 
monetary donations and its decision to lead a Provincial 
Reconstruction Team and to commit troops to a Forward Support 
Base.
