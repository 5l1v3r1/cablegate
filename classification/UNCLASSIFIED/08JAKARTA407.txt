SUBJECT: US-ASEAN SUPPORT PROGRAM LAUNCHED 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) ASEAN has been waiting with anticipation for a renewed 
commitment from the U.S., Secretary General (SG) Surin Pitsuwan 
stated in a February 25 courtesy call by DAS Marciel and 
representatives of the USAID Asia Regional Mission.  The team met 
with the SG to present and formally launch ADVANCE (ASEAN 
Development Vision to Advance National Cooperation and Economic 
Integration), a State/USAID funded, multi-sector development program 
to support ASEAN economic integration through 2015, the date set for 
achieving an ASEAN Community.  The courtesy call covered areas for 
future potential collaboration between the U.S. and ASEAN.  A joint 
press conference with local and regional media followed the meeting. 
 
 
 
ASEAN WELCOMES "RENEWED" U.S. COMMITMENT 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Dr. Surin welcomed the USG's increased engagement with 
ASEAN through ADVANCE.  He shared that the ASEAN member states' 
leaders and foreign ministers are upbeat about the direction the 
organization is taking, and that dialogue partner support is now 
more important than ever.  The member countries' leaders have 
instructed him to assume that the ASEAN Charter is already ratified 
and to proceed at "full speed" on economic integration. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The meeting participants brainstormed on ways that USG 
support could best align with ASEAN's strategic goals, including: 1) 
weaving USG bilateral and regional initiatives together to maximize 
effectiveness; 2) maintaining open communication on what initiatives 
work and where gaps remain; and 3) encouraging the involvement of 
the private sector in relevant areas such as economic policy and 
performance scorecarding. 
 
"ADVANCE" LAUNCHED IN PRESS CONFERENCE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Following the courtesy call, DAS Marciel, Dr. Surin, and 
USAID Asia's Mission Director, Olivier Carduner, participated in a 
press conference to formally announce the launch of ADVANCE and 
highlight the ongoing U.S. commitment to ASEAN.  Questions covered 
ADVANCE, the ASEAN Charter ratification process, and the U.S. 
position on Burma.  News outlets in Indonesia, ASEAN member 
countries and China carried the story. 
 
¶5. (U) DAS Marciel has cleared this telegram.
