¶1. SUMMARY.  During 21-23 July 2006, representatives of the 
African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance 
(ACOTA) Program and the Rwanda Defense Force (RDF) 
collaborated on plans for near-term pre-deployment peace 
support operations (PSO) training for RDF battalions 
preparing to deploy to the African Union Mission in Sudan 
(AMIS) as well as plans for long term ACOTA training and 
equipping activities in Rwanda.  The collaborations resulted 
in a clear plan of action for both near and long term ACOTA 
training and equipping activities to support RDF units 
preparing to deploy to AMIS.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  U.S. Embassy Defense Attach Major Ronald Miller, USA, 
joined ACOTA Regional Manager Richard Roan in meeting with 
RDF officials.  Key RDF officials participating in the ACOTA 
planning meetings included General James Kabarebe, Chief of 
the General Staff, Lieutenant General Charles Kayonga, Army 
Chief of Staff, Major General Patrick Nyamvumba, Chief of 
Logistics, and Colonel Michael Nkurunziza, Chief of Training 
and Doctrine. 
 
¶3.  General Kabarebe expressed gratitude for the AMIS 
pre-deployment training for six RDF battalions provided by 
the United States during the period of July 2005-February 
¶2006.  Colonel Nkurunziza noted that the training had 
decisively improved the RDF's performance in Darfur.  General 
Kabarebe expressed delight with Rwanda's recent recognition 
as an ACOTA partner and stated that Rwanda would continue to 
contribute peacekeepers to AMIS. 
 
¶4.  Near-term pre-deployment training.  During 24 July-25 
August 2006, ACOTA will provide PSO command and staff and 
soldier skills training for an RDF battalion preparing to 
deploy to AMIS.  This will be followed during 28 August-29 
September 2006 with training for a second battalion preparing 
for deployment to AMIS.  Both increments of pre-deployment 
training will be conducted at the RDF's Gako military 
training base. 
 
¶5.  AMIS Enhancement.  General Kayonga requested that all 
ACOTA training be enhanced to focus on particular challenges 
of peacekeeping in Darfur, to include basic warfighting 
skills.  Additionally, he requested that a week of 
marksmanship training will be added to each cycle of ACOTA 
battalion training.  General Nyamvumba stated his intention 
to provide the U.S. with a list of equipment critically 
needed to enhance the RDF's operational effectiveness in AMIS. 
 
¶6.  ACOTA Program in Rwanda.  ACOTA and RDF officials will 
conduct a detailed planning conference regarding the long 
term ACOTA program in Rwanda during 3-4 August 2006, in 
Kigali.  Colonel Nkurunziza stated that all near and long 
term ACOTA training and equipping activities will be focused 
on contingents preparing to deploy to AMIS.  Throughout the 
ACOTA meetings, all RDF officials emphasized their desire to 
expeditiously commence and sustain ACOTA training and 
equipping activities.
