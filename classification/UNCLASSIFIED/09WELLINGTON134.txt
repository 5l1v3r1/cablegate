¶1.  (U) In response to reftel action request, Post would like 
to mention the Energy Development in Island Nations (EDIN) 
project.  Launched in August 2008, EDIN is a partnership 
between Iceland, New Zealand and the United States to further 
the use of energy efficient and renewable energy technologies 
in island nations and territories.  These island countries, 
which are vulnerable to petroleum price volatility and 
dependence on imported petroleum fuels, often have abundant 
renewable energy resources such as solar, geothermal, wind 
and ocean energy resources.  In addition to contributing to 
the energy security of island nations, this effort also has 
the potential environmental benefits of developing clean 
energy and addressing global climate change. 
 
¶2.  (U) In April 2009, EDIN announced the initial projects 
selected by each of its respective members: 
-- The U.S. will assist the U.S. Virgin Islands in the 
assessment and development of its renewable energy resources; 
-- Iceland, an island nation with vast experience in 
utilizing geothermal energy, will assist the Caribbean nation 
of Dominica in the development of its geothermal potential; 
and 
-- New Zealand, also with significant geothermal expertise, 
will assist 18 Pacific island nations in assessing their 
potential for geothermal electricity generation. 
 
¶3.  (U) U.S. representation in EDIN is conducted through the 
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory in Golden, Colorado.  The DOE point of contact for 
EDIN is Mary Werner at Mary Werner@nrel.gov. 
 
¶4.  (U) For more information concerning EDIN, visit 
www.edinenergy.org. 
 
¶5.  (U) Post would also like to mention the partnership 
between the USG through the National Science Foundation (NSF) 
and the government of New Zealand (GNZ) in a project to 
provide wind-generated electricity in support of the NSF 
McMurdo Station and the neighboring New Zealand Scott Base in 
Antarctica.  For more information contact Kevin Gong in 
Embassy Wellington at GongK@state.gov.
