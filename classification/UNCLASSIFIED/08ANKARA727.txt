Controversy Continues over AKP Asking PACE to Condemn Closure Case 
All papers report opposition parties continue to criticize the AKP 
for asking the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe 
(PACE) to release a declaration condemning the closure case launched 
against the ruling party in Turkey.  Luis Maria de Puig, the new 
president of PACE, created uproar in Turkey when he said on Tuesday 
the Turkish delegation "demanded PACE release a declaration 
condemning the ban of political parties," and that Parliament 
Speaker Koksal Toptan invited him to Turkey.  AKP MP Mevlut 
Cavusoglu said the Turkish delegation did not ask PACE to release 
such a declaration.  Opposition far right MHP lawmaker Tugrul 
Turkes, a member of the Turkish delegation to PACE, told a press 
conference in Strasbourg, "any declaration released by PACE 
concerning the closure case could be perceived as an intervention in 
the functioning of independent jurisdiction in Turkey."  Opposition 
DSP chairman Zeki Sezer told a news conference in Ankara that this 
issue "deeply hurt the Turkish nation." 
 
Mainstream Milliyet reports in, "Who Is Lying about the Controversy 
Surrounding the Declaration?" that "the AKP is under fire" in claims 
that they demanded PACE to release the declaration. 
Islamist-oriented Zaman notes, "The AKP Deputies Were in Turkey When 
PACE Decided to Condemn the AKP Closure Case."  Mainstream Hurriyet 
headlines with, "CHP Leaders Blame the AKP for Filing a Suit against 
Turkey at PACE."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet carries the 
headline, "The AKP Faces the Consequences for Asking the 
Parliamentary Assembly to Condemn the Closure Suit." Cuneyt 
Arcayurek of Cumhuriyet calls the situation "a scandal," and accuses 
the AKP of seeking "pity" from foreigners.  Islamist-oriented Yeni 
Safak notes the head of the Turkish delegation to PACE, AKP Deputy 
Mevlut Cavusoglu, insists, "I would never file a complaint against 
Turkey!" 
 
Columnist Murat Belge of liberal Radikal noted, "Some argue if the 
AKP requested such a declaration it would embarrass Turkey.  But did 
these same people ask if the chief prosecutor embarrassed Turkey 
when he opened the closure case against the ruling party?" 
Columnist Mustafa Karaalioglu of mainstream Star criticized warnings 
to PACE not to comment on the AKP closure case.   Karaalioglu 
argued, "Such a position is no different than the activities of the 
Ergenekon gang."  Columnist Ozdemir Ince of mainstream Hurriyet 
wrote, "Turkey should make it easier, not harder, to shut down 
political parties."   Columnist Mehmet Ali Birand of top-selling 
mainstream Posta noted, "When the AKP pushed the headscarf reforms, 
the leftist-nationalists directed all their 'nuclear weapons' on the 
AKP.  Unless the AKP makes a goodwill gesture concerning the 
headscarf to eliminate the concerns in the public opinion, the 
leftist-nationalists will continue to fire their 'nuclear 
missiles.'"  Nevertheless, columnist Murat Yetkin of Radikal points 
out, "Prime Minister Erdogan knows EU entry talks and EU relations 
will not be enough to stop the ban of his party." 
 
Parliament to Discuss Article 301 Today 
Cumhuriyet and Radikal report the Turkish Parliament's Justice 
Committee will discuss the AKP-proposed changes to Article 301 of 
the Turkish Penal Code on Friday.  The proposal authorizes the 
president to permit the launch of investigations based on Article 
Â¶301.  Liberal Radikal reports the parliamentary Human Rights 
Committee Chairman Professor Zafer Uskul said his personal 
preference was for "the total abolishment of Article 301." 
Otherwise, Uskul said, "The authority to launch investigations 
should be given to the parliament's Human Rights Committee." 
 
Editorial Commentary on Revision of Penal Code Article 301 
 
"Defending 301 is Incompatible with Democracy and Freedom" 
Hasan Cemal wrote in mainstream Milliyet (4/18): "Article 301 is a 
never ending story.  The debate over 301 leads one to say 'enough is 
 
ANKARA 00000727  002 OF 003 
 
 
enough!'  It is hard to believe but there are some in this country 
who still defend the necessity of 301 even though the law vitally 
damages freedom of expression.  Nationalist circles defend 301; 
opposition parties CHP and MHP also defend it.  Moreover, there is a 
pro-301 constituency in the ruling AKP.  This constituency does not 
want to touch Article 301 because they use it in their political 
rhetoric when they say things like, 'how can we allow people to 
insult Turkishness?'  Article 301's story is doomed to be a black 
page in Turkey's democratic history.  Article 301 should be 
completely abolished." 
 
"Last Act on Article 301" 
Ali Bayramoglu wrote in Islamist leaning Yeni Safak (4/18): "Article 
301 has a bad record and represents an authoritarian approach. 
However, we can ignore the MHP campaign which claims, 'insulting 
Turkishness is now free.' We can also ignore opposition CHP leaders 
who try to be a part of this rhetoric.  Those who defend this 
article are the same ones who legitimized coup attempts.  To make a 
long story short: Article 301 should be abolished immediately.  The 
abolishment of this article will pave the way for freedoms and will 
symbolize the end of a non-democratic, dark period.  Unfortunately, 
the AKP proposal is only about changing the article instead of 
abolishing it completely.  A change in the article will not help 
anything; the non-democratic spirit of the article remains.  In 
addition, trivial changes to the article appear to be an attempt to 
placate criticisms before the upcoming elections.  Instead, the AKP 
could show some political courage and pursue the values of freedom. 
Principles are more important than pleasing the populace.  Let's 
hope to see a symbolic gesture from some AKP members who have the 
courage to sign and present to the parliament a proposal to 
completely abolish 301." 
 
Turkish Military Launches Sweeping PKK Operations in Southeast 
Turkey 
All papers report the Turkish General Staff (TGS) announced on its 
website one Turkish soldier was killed and seven others were wounded 
in operations against the PKK in the southeastern province of Sirnak 
on Wednesday.  Islamist-oriented Zaman reports the operations are 
entitled, "Operation Sword," and are focused in the rural areas of 
Hakkari, Sirnak, Tunceli, Diyarbakir, Bingol, and Siirt.  Tens of 
thousands of troops are participating in the operations; ground 
troops are reinforced with F-16 warplanes and helicopters, says 
Zaman.  Mainstream Sabah reports F-16 and F-4 fighter jets conducted 
flights along the border with Iraq.  The deployment of armored 
vehicles and ammunitions to the border area continues. 
 
No Turkish Companies Listed on Iraq's First Round of Bids for Oil 
Exploration 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others 
report the Iraqi central government did not put Turkish Petroleum 
Corporation (TPAO) on the list of foreign companies that will 
explore new oil reserves in Iraq.  Energy Minister Hilmi Guler told 
the press Thursday, "The Turkish government has begun talks with 
Baghdad in order to negotiate the inclusion of TPAO on the list. 
The list is not definite yet; there is no need for early comments. 
We will get on this list." 
 
Under the headline, "Iraq Double-Crosses Turkey," 
leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet quotes the director of a former 
state-owned oil transportation company, BOTAS, as saying the Turkish 
energy minister went to the U.S. together with President Gul to 
discuss energy investments in the region.  "The U.S. should press 
the Iraqi government to cooperate with Turkey," stressed the former 
director. 
 
Turkish Parliament Passes Controversial Social Security Law 
All papers report the Turkish parliament adopted a bill to change 
Social Security and Health Insurance Laws.  The newly adopted law 
raises the retirement age to 65 for both women and men by 2048.  The 
retirement age was previously 58 for women and 60 for men.  The law 
 
ANKARA 00000727  003 OF 003 
 
 
raises the number of days required to work before retirement from 
7,000 to 7,200.
