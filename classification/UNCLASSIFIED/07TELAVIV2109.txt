Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Yediot reported that the heads of NATO told Strategic Affairs 
Minister Avigdor Lieberman that Israel cannot count on the 
 
international community to help it militarily against the Iranian 
nuclear program.  Lieberman visited NATO Headquarters in Brussels a 
couple of weeks ago.  The Jerusalem Post reported that Brig. Gen. 
(res.) Yossi Kuperwasser, the former head of IDF Intelligence's 
Research Division, told the newspaper on Monday that time to launch 
an effective military strike against Iran's nuclear installations 
was running out.  Kuperwasser predicted that sanctions will 
ultimately fail to stop Tehran's nuclear program.  Yediot reported 
that Mossad employees are wondering whether the firing of the deputy 
director of the Mossad was due to a personal disagreement between 
him and Mossad Director Meir Dagan, or to an argument over Israel's 
Iran policy. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that on Monday visiting Italian PM Romano Prodi 
called for preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.  But he 
added that Israeli leaders should distinguish between Tehran's 
legitimate civil nuclear energy program and any attempt to acquire 
nuclear weapons, which must be prevented.  Prodi also denied reports 
in the Turin daily La Stampa that his government had prevented 
Italy's force in UNIFIL from obtaining information about the 
abducted Israeli soldiers in Lebanon.  The media reported that the 
families of the three Israeli soldiers being held hostage found an 
attentive ear with French President Nicolas Sarkozy. 
 
Maariv quoted Egyptian intelligence chief Omar Suleiman as saying 
that a deal to release IDF soldier Gilad Shalit has already been 
made in Israel-Hamas contacts under Egyptian mediation, but that the 
deal is stalled because of Israeli difficulties in drawing up an 
acceptable list of prisoners to be released.  Citing Arab sources, 
Makor Rishon-Hatzofe reported that Hamas has rejected the list of 
prisoners presented by Israel. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that in a letter published in the French 
daily Le Monde, a group of 10 EU foreign ministers has called for an 
international conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
calling the Roadmap plan dead.  The signatories of the letter were 
the FMs of France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Bulgaria, 
Romania, Cyprus, Slovenia, and Malta. 
 
Yediot cited data gathered by the IDF, according to which 25 tons of 
explosives have entered the Gaza Strip over the past month alone. 
 
Major media reported that in an interview to the Dubai-based 
satellite station Al Arabiya-TV, PM Ehud Olmert urged Syrian 
President Bashar Assad to "come to Jerusalem to talk."  In his first 
appearance on a major Arabic news station in over six years, Olmert 
said: "Bashar Assad, you know  You know I am ready to hold direct 
negotiations with you and you also know that it's you who insists on 
speaking to the Americans. The American President says: 'I don't 
want to stand between Bashar Assad and Ehud Olmert. If you want to 
talk, sit down and talk."  Olmert added that Assad has "heard many 
things from me already." 
 
Israel Radio quoted PA Chairman [President] Mahmoud Abbas as saying 
that Fatah will not resume dialogue with Hamas.  He accused Hamas of 
opening the gates to al-Qaida activists. 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted a spokesman for the (Israeli) Fruit 
Growers Association as saying that on Monday Hamas's Finance 
Ministry barred Israeli fruits and vegetables from entering the Gaza 
Strip.  The move is likely to cost Israeli fruit growers 3-5 million 
shekels a day (approx. USD 710,000 - 1.8 million). 
 
Ha'aretz reported that the office of the IDF Advocate General is 
considering petitioning the High Court of Justice against the 
Winograd Commission, because the commission has no plans to issue 
warning letters to any individual who may be harmed by the 
publication of its final report.  The commission's final report on 
the Second Lebanon War is expected in the fall. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that legal appeals to the High Court of 
Justice continue to delay the construction of the West Bank security 
fence, which may not be completed until 2010. 
 
Yediot reported that 25,000 Israelis have acquired American 
citizenship over the past decade and that there has been a sharp 
increase in green card applications by Israelis. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that the Israeli defense establishment will be 
keeping a close eye on developments in Lebanon's domestic political 
scene, especially for the next two weeks.  The newspaper cited 
Israel's concern that Hizbullah and its political allies may seek to 
establish an alternative government. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) is 
presently negotiating a USD 1.5 billion contract in India.  The 
deal, a joint protect with the Indian Army, involves development and 
manufacture of ground-to-air missiles. 
 
Ha'aretz quoted Jewish-American academics and community leaders as 
saying that the trend toward delegitimizing Israel's existence as a 
Jewish state is growing not only in Europe, but also in the US. 
 
The media reported that Israeli authorities have confined refugees 
from Sudan to prisons and other facilities.  Media said that the 
Defense Ministry is waiting for Cairo to establish a deportation 
administration that will be responsible for coordinating the 
refugees' return to Egypt.  Ha'aretz cited London -based daily 
Al-Hayat assaying that that Sudan has announced that it will 
institute legal proceedings against Sudanese who arrived in Israel 
as refugees. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that 25 Jewish and Arab Israeli youth attended a 
three-day filmmaking seminar at Kibbutz Ramat Hashofet, sponsored by 
the Education Ministry's Communications and Film Education 
Department in conjunction with the Haifa Cinematheque.  Their short 
works included personal histories related to the Israeli-Arab 
conflict. Organizers hoped to help forge collaborative relationships 
between the Jewish and Arab participants. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that IBM Israel focuses on innovation.

Summary:

Liat Collins, Editor of The International Jerusalem Post, wrote in 
the conservative, independent Jerusalem Post: "Olmert has 
temporarily gained a second chance to form the government.  It won't 
take long to see whether a second round means second best." 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz: "With Assad trying to inch 
closer toward the West, Syrian tourism on the rise, and moderate 
Islamic countries headed by Saudi Arabia urging Assad to act wisely 
and cautiously, Israel's leaders need to focus on Assad's peace 
proposal." 
 
The Director of the Interdisciplinary Center's Global Research in 
International Affairs Center, columnist Barry Rubin, wrote in The 
Jerusalem Post: "If deterrence must turn into implementation, the 
guns should be pointed in the right direction.  Let the Syrian 
rulers tremble where now they swagger." 
 
Block Quotes: 
------------- 
 
Â¶I.  "Double Trouble" 
 
Liat Collins, Editor of The International Jerusalem Post, wrote in 
the conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (7/10): "The [Second 
Lebanon] War blurred the borders between the home front and the 
front lines.... A year later, it is business as usual. And as usual, 
politics dominates.... Olmert's well-honed sense of political 
survival has ... enabled him to -- at least for now -- keep his 
coalition alive (albeit struggling).  But his political enemies are 
just waiting for an opportunity to trip him up. And it does not bode 
well that his No. 2 ([Haim] Ramon) hates his Defense Minister 
(Barak) and his Defense Minister would like nothing more than a 
second chance in the prime minister's seat.  Olmert has temporarily 
gained a second chance to form the government.  It won't take long 
to see whether a second round means second best.  Olmert is fighting 
the political battle of his life while Judge Eliahu Winograd is 
preparing his report and recommendations following last summer's war 
in the North.  A case of double jeopardy?" 
 
II.  "The Hot Air of August" 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz (7/10): "How can you tell that 
August is around the corner?  Because the country is talking itself 
silly over the terrible war that we are supposedly expecting this 
summer.... Large-scale war games conducted by the Syrian army near 
the border had all our big chiefs up in arms.  But Israel's war 
games in the Negev, preparing for a Syrian offensive, could have the 
same effect on Bashar Assad.... Coming from the dictatorship world, 
Assad is liable to think that Israel wants to erase the fiasco of 
the Second Lebanon War by means of a strike against Damascus.  An 
attack like that could bring down the Alawite regime and spell the 
end of Assad.  Syria is not one of those countries that goes to war 
all of a sudden, says a political analyst who knows the score.  In 
fact, the whole idea of a war this summer is absurd.  Why would 
Syria be the one to declare war when no Arab country has ever gone 
into battle alone against Israel?  With Assad trying to inch closer 
toward the West, Syrian tourism on the rise, and moderate Islamic 
countries headed by Saudi Arabia urging Assad to act wisely and 
cautiously, Israel's leaders need to focus on Assad's peace proposal 
and stop driving him crazy with their hot air forecasts for 
August." 
 
III.  "Getting Serious About Syria" 
 
The Director of the Interdisciplinary Center's Global Research in 
International Affairs Center, columnist Barry Rubin, wrote in The 
Jerusalem Post (7/10): "Clearly, Israel does not want war with 
Syria.  Yet the whole concept of deterrence is to make clear to the 
Syrians that Israel is not afraid of war, and that Syrian support 
for terrorism against Israel will have real and costly consequences. 
 Without this fear, there is no deterrence.  And without deterrence, 
war -- either directly with Syria or with Syria's clients in Lebanon 
-- is far more likely.  The weakness of Syria should also be a 
factor in Israeli thinking.... To rebuild Israeli deterrence 
requires a proper degree of credible threat against those inciting, 
planning, financing and equipping attacks on Israel.  This should be 
directed against those forces that are both implacable enemies and 
that have to take material losses into account.  If deterrence must 
turn into implementation, the guns should be pointed in the right 
direction.  Let the Syrian rulers tremble where now they swagger."
