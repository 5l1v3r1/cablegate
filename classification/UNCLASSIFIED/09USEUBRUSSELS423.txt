Please allow me to congratulate you upon your appointment as

The current situation in Sudan is particularly challenging. 
The immediate humanitarian needs, the demand for security and 
the search for political solutions certainly calls for more 
concerted international efforts. 
 
I hope to have an opportunity to meet you in the near future 
to get acquainted and discuss how we can jointly work on 
Sudan as well as related regional issues. 
 
Looking forward to continue close cooperation with the United 
States, I send you my best wishes for your new assignment. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
Torben Brylle
