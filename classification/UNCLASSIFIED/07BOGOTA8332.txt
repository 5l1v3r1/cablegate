SUBJECT: URIBE REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OBTAIN RELEASE OF 
HOSTAGES HELD BY FARC 
 
REF: BOGOTA 8305 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. President Uribe said the GOC remains committed to 
obtaining the release of hostages held by the FARC, and would 
work with French President Sarkozy on new ways to achieve 
this goal.  Still, he cautioned that any release should not 
strengthen the FARC or encourage kidnapping.  GOC Peace 
Commissioner Restrepo denied accusations by Senator Cordoba 
that the GOC had deliberately seized proof of life provided 
by the FARC to undermine President Chavez' and her 
facilitation efforts, and ruled out further involvement by 
either Cordoba or Chavez in the process.  FARC Commander Ivan 
Marquez criticized Uribe for "sabotaging" Chavez' role as 
facilitator. End Summary. 
 
------------ 
GOC RESPONSE 
------------ 
¶2. In a December 1 speech, President Uribe said the GOC 
remains committed to trying to obtain the release of the 
hostages held by the FARC, but cautioned that any steps taken 
should not strengthen the terrorist group or encourage future 
kidnappings.  He said he had spoken earlier that day with 
French President Sarkozy, and the two had agreed to explore 
new ways to achieve the hostages' freedom.  Uribe stressed 
that while the FARC had produced proof of life for some 
hostages, it continues to hold over 750 Colombians that it 
had kidnapped over the last few years. 
 
¶3. On December 2, GOC Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo 
denied accusations by Senator Piedad Cordoba that the GOC had 
intercepted the proof of life which it had made public on 
November 30 prior to the November 20 visit of Venezuelan 
President Chavez and Cordoba to Paris.  Restrepo reiterated 
that the GOC had seized the proof of life on November 29 in 
Bogota and had made the materials public almost immediately. 
He said Chavez' and Cordoba's facilitation effort had 
produced no results, and reviewed numerous errors committed 
by the two.  Restrepo said the GOC no longer considers Chavez 
and Cordoba as an option to facilitate an accord and stressed 
that the GOC would work closely with the French.  He warned 
that the FARC's intransigence--especially its insistence on a 
demilitarized zone in which to hold talks--would make it hard 
for any facilitator to produce results.

CORDOBA AND FAMILIES VISIT CHAVEZ 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Senator Cordoba and twelve members of the families of the 
hostages traveled to Caracas to meet with President Hugo 
Chavez on December 1 to thank him for obtaining the proof of 
life from the FARC.  Family members voiced frustration with 
the GOC for releasing the proof of life to the media before 
members of the families were able to view them.  Yolanda 
Pulecio, mother of Ingrid Betancourt, sharply criticized the 
GOC for making available to the media Ingrid's letter to her. 
 Cordoba repeated her claims that the GOC had deliberately 
obstructed her efforts to advance a humanitarian accord, and 
urged President Uribe to give her and Chavez until December 
31 to obtain the release of some hostages. (Note: Uribe 
initially set a December 31 deadline for the Chavez-Cordoba 
initiative to show results before ending their involvement on 
November 21.)  After meeting with Cordoba and Betancourt's 
family members on December 3, Chavez said he would be willing 
to continue working to promote a humanitarian exchange. 
 
--------------- 
FARC SPEAKS OUT 
--------------- 
 
¶5. FARC Commander Ivan Marquez said in an article posted on 
the FARC's website on November 30 that the proof of life 
seized by the GOC on November 29 was intended for President 
Chavez.  He had promised Chavez that the FARC would deliver 
such evidence during their November 8 meeting at Miraflores 
palace in Caracas.  Marquez claimed the GOC seizure 
 
undermined the efforts of Chavez and Cordoba over the last 
three months, and said "there will never be a humanitarian 
exchange as long as Uribe continues to act like this."  He 
criticized Uribe's insistence on maintaining his 
non-negotiable points, especially the refusal to allow 
released FARC members to return to the group's ranks, and 
called him a "saboteur."  Marquez said Sarkozy could play a 
role similar to that of Chavez in facilitating a humanitarian 
process, but questioned whether he would be willing to do so.
