REF: A) USDOC 09934 B) D386643 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), attempted 
to conduct a pre-license check at Mingxin Technology (Hong Kong) 
Co., MSH 2182, Room 1007, 10/F, Ho Kong Commercial Center, No 2-16 
Fa Yuen St. Mongkok, Hong Kong (Mingxin). The purpose of the visit 
was to determine the suitability of Mingxin to be the ultimate 
consignee (but not end user) of various Husky brand diaphragm pumps 
that are the subject of export license application D3386643.  The 
items (ECCN 2B350) are valued at USD $36,375 and are controlled for 
chemical and biological weapons reasons (CB). The license applicant 
is Graco, Inc. of Minneapolis, Minnesota and the stated end-user of 
the items is Ciba Specialty Chemicals of Nanjing, mainland China. 
 
¶3.  A Hong Kong Companies Registry check of Mingxin reveals that the 
company has been in existence since 2003.  Its paid up capital is 
the Hong Kong equivalent of USD 1,200.  Directors are listed as 
mainland Chinese national Cai, Qian (passport number G03218234) and 
Wu, Wutien of Taiwan (with passport number 132249850).  Those 
individuals are not listed as directors in any other companies in 
Hong Kong. 
 
¶4. Background research on the web reveals that several other 
companies list Mingxin's address as their company address including 
New Century Textile Decorating Co., Ltd. and Kai Shun (HK) 
Enterprise Limited.  The companies at this address appear to be 
unrelated to Mingxin and are involved in unrelated businesses 
(textiles, health food distribution, chemicals).  Mingxin does not 
have a web presence. 
 
¶5.  Another company with a very similar name has a web presence and 
lists its address in Shenzhen, mainland China.  This company, Min 
Xin Technology (H.K.) Electronics Co. (with the same Chinese 
characters for Min Xin as for Mingxin) is involved in the 
electronics distribution business.  According to its web site 
(www.minxintechnology.com), this company is a famous leading 
independent distributor in China, specializing in military and 
obsolete parts.  There is no reference to this company in the Hong 
Kong Companies Registry database (notwithstanding the use of H.K. in 
the company name). 
 
¶6.  On December 19, 2007, ECO, accompanied by Commercial Assistant 
Carrie Chan attempted to visit Mingxin at the addressed listed 
above.  The telephone number listed in reftel A was actually in use 
by a major bank in Hong Kong so ECO was unable to schedule an 
appointment with Mingxin.  A large commercial building is located at 
the address and it is filled with the offices of smaller trading 
companies.  Room 1007 at the referenced address was vacant although 
a large mailbox on the front door of the office contained mail. 
According to security personnel at the front entrance of the 
building, room 1007 has been vacant for some time although, from 
time to time, someone comes to collect mail from the mailbox.
