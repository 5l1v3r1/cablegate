War at Caucasus 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (08/11) says: "With a 
disfigured multilateralism it is even more difficult to resist the 
Russian expansionism on display in Georgia. ... Moscow's means of 
persuasion are not limited to its nuclear destructive capabilities 
any more.  The characteristics of the new cycle of Russia's economic 
ascension, a country essential to guarantee the supply of natural 
gas and oil to the Europeans became a crucial diplomatic tool for 
the Kremlin. ...It is obvious that the international system is too 
weak to mediate the conflict and demand an immediate cease fire. 
Just remember that Bush, the paladin of Georgia's sovereignty, 
commanded the military invasion of a sovereign country, in an open 
challenge to U.N. " 
 
 
Doha and and Lost Hegemony 
 
Analysis by former Brazilian Treasury Minister Luiz Carlos Bresser 
Pereira in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (08/11) comments: "If we were 
still in the 90's, this round would have been concluded.  However, 
at the end of 2000, we understand why the rich countries do not 
succeed in imposing their power so easily.  During this period, 
their neo liberal reforms revealed themselves unable to promote 
economic development: a growing number of developing countries, now 
headed by India and China, reached extraordinary growing rates and 
changed the international balance of power, and the deplorable War 
in Iraq and the present financial crisis weakened their "hegemony". 
Brazil lost because the Doha Round would benefit us, but the poor 
countries headed by India won."
