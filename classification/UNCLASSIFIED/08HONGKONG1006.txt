1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted two post shipment-verifications (PSVs) at Qioptiq 
Singapore Pte. Ltd., 14 Fifth Lok Yang Road, Jurong Town, Singapore 
(Qioptiq). The items in question are two Moore Nanotechnology 
Nanotech 2-Axis turning lathes exported to Qioptiq on or about July 
20, 2007 and November 8, 2007.  The items are classified under 
Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 2B001 and are controlled 
for national security (NS) and nuclear nonproliferation (NP) 
reasons.  The exporter was Sachman Associates of Sudbury, 
Massachusetts. 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore companies registry, Qioptiq was 
registered in 2005 and its registered share capital is the Singapore 
dollar equivalent of approximately USD 2.25 million.  Its directors 
are Singapore citizens, Lee, Seng Gey and Chua Teow Tzing as well as 
French citizen Benoit Bazire. 
 
¶4.  A review of the company's web site (www.quioptiq.com.sg) reveals 
that the company specializes in providing design and manufacturing 
of precision optical components and assemblies for night vision, 
defense, medical and commercial applications.  It has been in 
operation (under different names) since 1974.  More information 
about the range of the company's activities can be found on its web 
site. 
 
¶5.  On April 21, 2008, the ECO, accompanied by a representative of 
Singapore Customs, visited the company and met with Mr. Wong, Chung 
Cheong, Export Control Officer, Mr. Jenny Choo, Supply Chain Manager 
and Mr. Jim McShane, Export Compliance Manager.  Mr. McShare is 
known to the ECO and is a former senior manager in the State 
Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls.  Mr. McShane provided 
additional information about the company.  He stated that he had 
been brought into the company in 2005 to enhance its overall export 
compliance program and bring it into compliance with international 
standards. 
 
¶6.  As to the particular items in question, Mr. McShane stated that 
they were being used in the production of defense related as well 
civil products (but no WMD related products).  He stated that the 
company is expanding its business and has two additional machines on 
order and is expecting those in June 2008.  The customers for its 
products include military buyers in the United States, Pakistan, 
Israel, NATO and the UAE. 
 
¶7. ECO verified that Qioptiq was informed of the applicable license 
conditions (as required by the relevant licenses) and that it keeps 
a production log as required by those licenses.  ECO verified the 
two machines are at the company's premises (Serial # 2007-66-CPL and 
2007-70-CPL). 
 
¶8.  At the time visited, Qioptiq appeared to be a suitable recipient 
of the commodities shipped since Qioptiq cooperated with the PSV, 
provided ECO with access to the items and related documents and 
operates a line of business consistent with the use of the items. 
Also, Qioptiq is familiar with the applicable license conditions and 
expressed its commitment to comply with them.
