Anti-Terror Supreme Board Gives Nod to Cross-Border Operation 
All papers give extensive front page coverage to funerals for the 15 
soldiers killed by the PKK, demonstrations against terrorism held at 
many universities, and the decisions of the Supreme Anti-terror 
Board.  A statement issued after the Board meeting said that 
necessary instructions were given to all relevant institutions and 
organizations to take all legal, political and economic measures, 
including cross-border operation, to put an end to the presence of 
the terrorist organization in a neighboring country.  Mainstream 
Milliyet reports that PM Erdogan, at the AKP Central Administrative 
Board meeting said that the government has started preparations to 
get authorization from the parliament for a cross-border operation. 
High-level AKP members told the paper that there is great 
possibility that after long holiday weekend coming up, the motion 
asking authorization would come to parliament.  Defense Minister 
Gonul told the journalists that for a cross-border operation an 
authorization motion is required however, for hot pursuit, it is not 
necessary, adds the paper. 
 
Following the Supreme Anti-terror Board meeting, US Ambassador Ross 
Wilson was called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Under 
Secretary Apakan underlined Turkey's determination to take all kinds 
 
SIPDIS 
of measures.  Sabah, Milliyet, Cumhuriyet and others quoted US State 
Department Spokesman Sean McCormack as saying "If there is a 
problem, Turkey and Iraq should cooperate to resolve it.  I am not 
sure that a cross-border operation will lead to a long-term, lasting 
solution."  US Assistant Secretary of State for European and 
Eurasian Affairs Dan Fried said on the issue that the US has a lot 
to do to end PKK terrorism, such as pressuring the Kurdish regional 
administration and the relevant officials in Baghdad.  White House 
spokesperson Dana Perino was quoted in Vatan and Aksam as saying 
"Turkish plans for a cross-border operation into Northern Iraq are 
premature". 
 
Meanwhile, many universities across Turkey issued protest messages 
and held marches to denounce PKK terrorism. 
 
Commentary: PKK terror/Iraq/US 
Erdal Safak writes in the mainstream daily Sabah: "Let's hope that 
both the US as well as Talabani and Barzani realize that Turkey has 
really come to the point where patience has run out.  We cannot 
afford to waste any more time on US stalling tactics like those of 
the last two years.  During this period we have seen nothing more 
than promises.  When PM Erdogan had a meeting with President Bush 
twenty months ago, he said that Bush seemed very determined to fight 
against the PKK.  That led to the coordination mechanism against the 
PKK.  Today there is no trace of coordinators, but the presence of 
PKK in northern Iraq has become even stronger than before.  They 
have better weapons -- thanks to the missing American weapons. And 
they have better financial resources --thanks to the cash flowing 
from Europe.  Iraqi Kurdish leaders and the US administration should 
take the current picture as a final warning from Turkey and should 
take measures accordingly, before it is too late." 
 
"Not Across the Border, Across the Atlantic Ocean" 
Turan Alkan writes in the Islamist-leaning daily Zaman: "The US 
pursued a policy of negligence and showed reluctance to engage in 
active cooperation with Turkey against terrorism.  Turkey on the 
other hand is having a problem because it did not take a clear 
stance with the US on this issue so far.  Frankly speaking Turkey 
has lost its chance to finish off PKK terror through military means. 
 It was also very unfortunate that the DTP, in its parliamentary 
representation, showed reluctance to act moderately.  The US and 
Turkey are in a struggle at the moment and the PKK issue is just the 
visible part of it.  We have to accept the fact that the US is our 
genuine interlocutor on the PKK issue which has connections to both 
the EU and the US. "Cross-border operation" has become such a 
frequently used term, it has lost its credibility.  If we have to 
 
ANKARA 00002508  002 OF 002 
 
 
talk about an operation, we should call it a "Cross-Atlantic 
operation."  The AKP government should take up this issue with its 
sensitivities but act with determination.  It should also free 
itself from clichs and the usual rhetorical approaches." 
 
Armenian Genocide Resolution in Congress 
All papers report that today the Foreign Affairs Committee of the US 
House of Representatives will debate the Armenian genocide 
resolution.  As a last attempt to lobby against it, President Gul 
sent a letter to US President Bush saying that if the resolution is 
adopted it would cause problems in relations.  TGS Chief General 
Buyukanit also sent a letter to his counterpart General Mullen and 
conveyed the same message.  Mainstream Sabah reports that the 
Turkish Jewish Association took out adds in the Washington Post and 
the Washington Times today calling on Congress to "leave the job to 
historians" 
 
Special Envoy Ralston's Resignation 
Mainstream Sabah reports that US State Department Spokesman 
McCormack confirmed the resignation of counterterrorism special 
envoy retired General Joseph Ralston and added that he resigned due 
to personal reasons.
