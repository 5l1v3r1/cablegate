¶1. In response to refs a and b, Post conducts a vigorous, 
ongoing program of outreach to the Cuban dissident community 
here in Spain as well as a steady public diplomacy effort 
designed to build support for peaceful democratic change in 
Cuba.  All this is of course in addition to steady engagement 
with the GOS on the subject of Cuba, the focal point of which 
is urging that the GOS seek concrete democratic change in its 
dialogue with the GOC and that it not fail to engage civil 
society and the dissident community in Cuba. 
 
¶2. To summarize recent activity, in March, the Ambassador 
published an op-ed on the need for meaningful transition in 
Cuba.  He stressed the need for the EU to show solidarity 
with the Cuban people, not with the dictatorial government. 
Also in March (and as detailed in ref c), we hosted a visit 
by Elsa Morejon, wife of imprisoned dissident Dr. Oscar 
Biscet.  Ms. Morejon stayed at the Ambassador's residence, 
and we facilitated a meeting with MFA Secretary of State for 
Iberoamerica Trinidad Jimenez as well as with former 
President Aznar.  We also arranged encounters with the press 
(ABC and Epoca). Also in March, the Ambassador hosted a 
coffee at his residence for Cuban dissidents, including four 
recently-released prisoners (Omar Pernet, Jose Gabriel Ramon 
Castillo, Pedro Pablo Alvarez Ramos, and Alejandro Gonzales 
Raga).  In April, we hosted visits by Cuba Transition 
Coordinator Caleb McCarry (ref d) and WHA Assistant Secretary 
Tom Shannon (septel), both of which provided excellent 
opportunities for engagement on Cuba in a variety of public 
and private settings. 
 
¶3. Post will continue its aggressive engagement on the issue 
of Cuba and intends to place an op-ed on the occasion of May 
¶21.  In that regard, we would appreciate any building blocks 
the Department could provide, in particular with regards to 
tailoring the public diplomacy message regarding the EU 
common position and the restrictive measures, where the U.S. 
and Spain are moving in different directions.  In addition, 
the Charge d'Affaires plans to host an event for the Cuban 
dissident community in Spain in observance of May 21.
