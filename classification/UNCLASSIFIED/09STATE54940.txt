¶2. Begin text: 
 
 Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
I appreciated meeting with you on May 8, both to advance 
our comprehensive bilateral agenda and to compare notes 
on regional issues. 
 
Thank you for your insightful paper on European 
security.  Your ideas are timely as we prepare for the 
June 27-28 OSCE Ministerial in Corfu. 
 
I share your view that we must take a proactive approach 
to the debate on European security in coordination with 
our European partners and that we need to reenergize the 
idea of comprehensive security.  I also agree that it is 
important for Europe and the United States to speak with 
one voice. 
 
As part of this process, we will be reaching out to our 
Finnish counterparts in Helsinki, Brussels, and Vienna. 
I note, as well, that even as we consider the next 
generation of multilateral arms control and confidence 
building measures, we must continue to work to achieve 
full implementation by all nations of the regimes, in 
particular CFE, to which they have already committed 
themselves.  I look forward to working closely with you 
in this process. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton
