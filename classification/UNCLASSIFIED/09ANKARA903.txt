In Today's Papers 
 
The Subject of Terrorism Was on The Table During DTP's Dinner for EU 
Diplomats 
Islamist-oriented Zaman, leftist Taraf, and mainstream Sabah report 
that, following PM Erdogan's recent dinner with EU ambassadors, the 
largely pro-Kurdish opposition party DTP hosted the EU ambassadors 
for dinner on Wednesday night.  Zaman says the EU ambassadors 
emphasized they "could not help the DTP unless the party takes steps 
to distance themselves from the PKK."  In addition, Sabah notes, the 
EU ambassadors "reminded (DTP Chairman) Ahmet Turk that the PKK has 
been declared a terrorist organization."  Meanwhile, Turk emphasized 
during his speech that "The government keeps silent when the army 
speaks," which he said "means the Kurdish issue cannot be solved 
under these circumstances."  Taraf notes Turk pointed out, "Millions 
of people are crying 'Long live the PKK and Ocalan,'" and he noted, 
"The PKK is a reality."   Zaman reports Turk "dismissed calls for 
disarmament" of the PKK by saying, "The people in the mountains ask 
whether they will be sent to jail after they lay down their weapons. 
There are 17,000 unresolved murders. If the people are expected to 
forgive these murders, the state also needs to outline a project for 
dealing with the issue." Nevertheless, Turk also emphasized his 
support for Turkey's territorial integrity when he said, "I am a 
Kurd, but I want to live here in a democratic environment, not in an 
independent Kurdistan in Iraq."  Finally, DTP Deputy and Vice Chair 
Emine Ayna spoke out to say the DTP "condemns terror" and she 
pointed out, "there is a difference between the PKK and terror." 
 
Retired General Cevik Bir Testifies Under Ergenekon Investigation 
All papers:  Today's papers widely cover that former deputy chief of 
staff retired General Cevik Bir, who played a major role in February 
28 process and a former high-level intelligence officer of the 
National Intelligence Organization (MIT) Nuri Gundes testified to 
Zekeriya Oz concerning the Ergenekon investigation in Istanbul. 
Mainstream Hurriyet notes that both General Bir and Gundes were 
summoned to the prosecutor's office as suspects for planning an 
assassination against PM Erdogan. 
 
PM Erdogan: "We are Determined" 
Mainstream Sabah reports that PM Erdogan made some statements in 
regard to the decision of the military prosecutor's office which 
said that the action plan to fight reactionary movement was not 
prepared at the General Staff headquarters.  Replying to questions 
on the matter prior to his departure for Albania Erdogan said the 
prosecutor's office, the government and the Turkish Armed Forces 
"will do what is necessary."  Erdogan said "We are determined to 
find the origin of this plan.  There is a need to investigate 
whether there was such an effort or not in the Armed Forces." 
 
Editorial Commentary on Military-Civilian Relations and The 
Coup-Plotting Debate 
 
Ali Bayramoglu wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "The essence 
of this debate is the improvement of our democracy.  It is a process 
and it has to continue regardless of consequences." 
 
Mustafa Unal wrote in Islamist oriented Zaman: "When military court 
decided to send the case to civilian authority it was more out of 
self-defense than anything else.  Let's hope that General Basbug 
clears the fog when he meets with press today." 
 
Yasemin Congar wrote in leftist Taraf: "PM Erdogan's recent approach 
to the document debate indicated that he believes in the existence 
of a coup-plotter group within the army, excluding Chief of General 
Staff Basbug.  Therefore, when General Basbug meets with press, he 
better address this concern and persuade public opinion about the 
steps he is going to take in order to eliminate such groups from the 
army." 
 
Nazli Ilicak wrote in mainstream Sabah: "The coup-plotter document 
is in the hands of civilian judiciary.  The prosecutors of the 
 
ANKARA 00000903  002 OF 002 
 
 
Ergenekon case should immediately take up this case in their 
portfolio." 
 
Former Coup General Defies Trial Prospects 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports that Kenan Evren, leader of the military 
junta of a 1980 coup in Turkey and a former president, has strongly 
reacted to prospects of facing trial for taking over.  He said "go 
to a referendum and ask the people.  If they want me to be tried, 
then I promise, I will take my life with my own hands without 
waiting for a court decision."  The main opposition party CHP has 
proposed recently to amend an article of the Turkish Constitution 
which prevented the members of 1980 military junta from 
prosecution. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Removal of Article 15 
 
Mehmet Y. Yilmaz wrote in mainstream Hurriyet: "Efforts to remove 
article 15 from the constitution demonstrates insincerity for both 
the ruling party and the opposition.  Even though it is presented as 
paving the way for bringing military coup leaders before the 
judiciary, the ruling AKP is enjoying this until the bitter end, 
when the foundation and the structure shaped by the military leaders 
is completely finished.  And the opposition CHP has done nothing to 
abolish the overall military character of the constitution.   Turkey 
needs a brand new constitution and such individual changes will not 
take us anywhere."
