SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE,S AMBASSADOR,S SPECIAL SELF-HELP PROGRAM 
FINAL REPORT FOR FY2004 AND FUNDING REQUEST FOR FY 2005FY 
2005 
 
REF: STATE 06604 
 
¶1. (U) Post does not anticipate returning any of its USD 
89,100 FY 2004 Self-Help Allowance for re-allocation.  Funds 
were obligated on September 30, 2004 as outlined in 
paragraphs 3, and 4 below. 
 
¶2. (U) For FY 2005, post requests Self-Help funding be 
restored to the FY 2003 level of USD 110,000.  The continuing 
socio-economic crises in Zimbabwe show no sign of subsiding 
and the need for assistance continues to increase.  Chronic 
hyper-inflation eats away at funding before it can be used. 
In this environment, stagnant funding levels would reduce 
post,s ability to assist those in need.  A decrease in 
funding would magnify this effect even more.  The Self-Help 
Program represents one of the best remaining channels for the 
USG to foster good relations with the people of Zimbabwe. 
Self-Help projects not only create goodwill among Self-Help 
beneficiaries, but the GOZ-controlled media also runs 
positive stories on these projects. 
 
¶3. (U) Due to funding cuts and triple-digit inflation, post 
only funded 10 projects in FY 2004 compared to 16 projects in 
FY 2003. Post funded 2 water projects; 3 income generation 
projects, 2 school construction projects, 2 medical clinics, 
and 1 training facility.

The grant will help the local community build a new rural 
health clinic for four hundred households in eight local

trenching for the foundation, and making a reservoir for 
water.

classrooms as the first priority in case the money runs out. 
The 271 students and 12 teachers grow and sell vegetables 
from the school garden to generate income for the school. The 
school will provide skilled and unskilled labor for the 
building project.

the electric paper-making machinery we provided.
