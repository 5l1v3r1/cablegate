SUBJECT: MESSAGE FROM SECRETARY CLINTON ON AFGHANISTAN 
AND PAKISTAN 
 
THE FOLLOWING IS A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY TO 
ALL STATE DEPARTMENT AND USAID PERSONNEL: 
 
DEAR COLLEAGUES: 
 
TODAY PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCED A NEW STRATEGY TO GUIDE 
U.S. POLICY IN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN.  THIS STRATEGY 
FOCUSES OUR EFFORTS TOWARD MEETING A CORE GOAL:  TO 
DISRUPT, DISMANTLE AND DEFEAT AL QAEDA AND ITS SAFE 
HAVENS IN PAKISTAN, AND TO PREVENT THEIR RETURN TO 
AFGHANISTAN OR PAKISTAN. 
 
WE ARE PURSUING THIS GOAL BECAUSE THE U.S. HAS A VITAL 
INTEREST IN THE STABILITY OF AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN. 
IF LEFT ALONE, THE THREATS EMANATING FROM THAT REGION 
ENDANGER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES 
AROUND THE WORLD. 
 
THEREFORE, AS THE PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR, MEETING OUR CORE 
GOAL REQUIRES THAT WE USE ALL ELEMENTS OF OUR NATIONAL 
POWER - DIPLOMATIC, DEVELOPMENT, MILITARY, ECONOMIC AND 
INFORMATIONAL.  THAT'S WHY I AM WRITING YOU TODAY. 
BECAUSE WHETHER THIS STRATEGY SUCCEEDS OR NOT DEPENDS IN 
LARGE PART ON ALL OF US AT THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND 
USAID. 
 
 
 
 
 
OUR NEW APPROACH IN AFGHANISTAN EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE 
OF FULLY RESOURCING A COUNTER-INSURGENCY STRATEGY, AND 
THE PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED TO DEPLOY MORE MILITARY 
TRAINERS TO HELP BOLSTER THE AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES.  BUT 
THE MAJOR SHIFT IN THIS STRATEGY IS TO EMPHASIZE OUR 
DIPLOMATIC AND CIVILIAN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVES 
IN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN.  OVER THREE-QUARTERS OF THE 
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS OUTLINED IN THE STRATEGIC REVIEW 
ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OR USAID. 
THAT MEANS MORE CIVILIAN EXPERTISE WORKING ON THE GROUND; 
IT MEANS PURSUING GREATER REGIONAL DIPLOMACY; AND IT 
MEANS SUSTAINED HIGH-LEVEL ATTENTION AND FOCUS IN 
WASHINGTON. 
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ASKED FOR A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN 
RESOURCES FOR OUR DIPLOMATIC AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS IN 
AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN, AND WE WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY 
WITH CONGRESS TO SEE THAT THESE REQUESTS ARE FULLY 
FULFILLED.  IT ALSO MEANS CHANGING THE WAY WE DO 
BUSINESS:  THIS NEW STRATEGY MAKES CLEAR THAT WE MUST 
IMPLEMENT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE MANAGEMENT, 
RESOURCES, AND FOCUS OF OUR FOREIGN ASSISTANCE. 
IMPLEMENTING OUR STRATEGY WILL BE AMONG THE HIGHEST 
PRIORITIES FOR ME AND MY ENTIRE LEADERSHIP TEAM, 
INCLUDING THE SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR AFGHANISTAN AND 
PAKISTAN, WHO REPORTS DIRECTLY TO ME AND WILL BE THE 
FOCAL POINT FOR ALL OUR CIVILIAN ACTIVITIES IN THIS 
EFFORT.  AND OF COURSE, WE WILL BE ASKING ALL COUNTRIES 
WHO HAVE A STAKE IN THE FUTURE OF THIS CRITICAL REGION TO 
DO THEIR PART - A MESSAGE I WILL DELIVER NEXT WEEK WHEN I 
MEET WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM OVER EIGHTY COUNTRIES AT 
THE HAGUE. 
 
GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE CHALLENGE WE FACE, IT IS 
APPROPRIATE THAT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE GREATER THAN 
BEFORE.  THE EXPECTATIONS ARE HIGH; BUT WE CAN MEET THEM. 
IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD, I ASK FOR ALL OF YOUR 
IDEAS, TALENT, CREATIVITY, HARD WORK AND SACRIFICE TO 
HELP MAKE THIS NEW STRATEGY SUCCEED.  THE ABILITY OF THE 
AFGHAN AND PAKISTANI PEOPLE TO BUILD PEACEFUL AND 
PROSPEROUS LIVES - AND THE FUTURE NATIONAL SECURITY OF 
THE UNITED STATES - REQUIRES NOTHING LESS. 
 
END TEXT. 
CLINTON
