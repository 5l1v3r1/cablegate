Report 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: Guangxi's gross domestic product (GDP) 
growth reached a record high 13.1% in the third quarter (Q3) 
of 2006.  The Statistics Bureau again characterized 
Guangxi's economic development as "fast and steady" despite 
government control measures.  The secondary and tertiary 
sectors experienced significant growth.  Fixed asset 
investments increased but not as quickly as the first two 
quarters.  Inflation remained low.  Foreign trade, 
particularly with ASEAN countries, was strong.  Residents' 
income continued double-digit growth.  Guangxi will likely 
achieve 12% GDP growth in 2006.  END SUMMARY.
