 The Chairman of the Board of NINGBO 
HESHENG GROUP is LUO Liguo and the General Manager is LUO

¶6. According to Mr. ZHOU, NINGBO LUO NING SILICONE 
MANUFACTURING CO LTD uses silicone to make 
silicone rubber for applications in consumer electronics and 
other products including wristbands 
as popularised by major sports and entertainment figures, 
e.g., Lance Armstrong's yellow "Live

CO LTD needed a reliable supplier 
 
BEIJING 00020070  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
of raw materials so the parent company, TIANYI INVESTMENT CO, 
formed HE SHENG CHEMICAL. HE SHENG

ELECTRIC, specifically GE-TOSHIBA JIANGSU 
NANTONG SILICONE MANUFACTURING FACTORY; however, a firm 
contract has not een signed nor has an 
order for product actualy been placed. Other possible

¶7. Mr. ZHOU stated that HE SHENG CHEMICAL will specialise in 
the following product areas: silicone 
oil, silicone resin, and silicone rubber. The factory is 
currently under construction and he is 
awaiting equipment, including the heat exchangers sought in 
this export license application, in 
order to complete construction. Mr. ZHOU expects to start 
operations in November 2006 with actual 
production commencing in January 2007. Mr. ZHOU anticipates 
annual output of approximately 4000 
tons of room temperature and high temperature silicone 
rubber. HE SHENG CHEMICAL currently has 
200 employees and Mr. ZHOU plans to hire up to 600 employees. 
Mr. ZHOU stated that all of the 
managerial staff have backgrounds in chemical engineering. 
 
¶8. ECO toured the construction site with Mr. ZHOU and 
observed the area where the heat exchangers 
will be installed. The actual factory is being constructed by 
the THIRD CHEMICAL CONSTRUCTION 
COMPANY, which was selected through an open bidding process. 
HE SHENG CHEMICAL occupies a 400 "mu" 
lot and is building in two phases, with Phase 1 on 160 "mu". 
Additional construction will be 
considered after the completion of Phase I, and a 
construction company selected through another 
open bid. 
 
¶9. RECOMMENDATION - FAVOURABLE. ECO notes that para. 13 of 
REFTEL (USDOC 3976) states "Interagency 
PLC request on commodities controlled for CBW reasons... 
There are also issues regarding the 
purchaser that should be resolved." It is unclear what issues 
require further resolution, and 
efforts to clarify this and interagency concerns were 
unsuccessful. Research by ECO did not 
uncover any ties to parties of proliferation or law 
enforcement concern. ECO found Mr. ZHOU 
and other company officials to be cooperative and forthcoming 
during the site visit, Mr. ZHOU 
also provided ECO with photographs of the HE SHENG CHEMICAL 
facility under construction, which 
can be made available to interested parties through direct 
request to ECO. Based upon the 
limited information provided in REFTEL and the information 
developed during the PLC, ECO 
recommends this company as a likely to be a responsible 
recipient of U.S. controlled items and 
technology.
