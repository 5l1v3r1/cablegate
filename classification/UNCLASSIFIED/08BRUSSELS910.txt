SUBJECT: BELGIUM EXTENDS ITS UNIFIL MISSION UNTIL THE END 
OF 2008 
 
Belgium has decided to continue its UNIFIL mission until the 
end of the year.  As a partial cost saving for the 
financially-strapped Belgian Ministry of Defense, the number 
of tropps deployed will be reduced from 370 to 335.  In 
addition, from September until the end of the year, a Belgian 
frigate will participate in UNIFIL's sea operations. 
Belgium's mission expired June 15.
