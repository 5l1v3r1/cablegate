SUBJECT: DECEMBER 29, 2009 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: AMCIT IN NORTH KOREA, 
UK CITIZEN EXECUTED, RESCUE OF DE XIN HAI SHIP AND CREW, LIU XIAOBO, 
AIRLINE SECURITY 
 
¶1. Key points at the December 29 MFA press briefing were: 
 
-- China hopes the U.S. will uphold the larger issue of stability on 
the Korean Peninsula when addressing US citizen Robert Park's 
detention in North Korea. 
 
-- The execution of UK citizen Akmal Shaikh for drug smuggling, 
despite claims that he suffers from mental disorders, was handled in 
strict accordance with the rule of law. 
 
-- China looks to enhance the ability of its naval fleet to protect 
its citizens overseas and its legitimate rights and interests 
abroad, following the recovery of a Chinese ship and crewmembers 
from Somali pirates. 
 
-- China handled the case of Liu Xiaobo publicly and in strict 
accordance to the law. 
 
-- China in response to NW 253 was coordinating with the U.S. to 
strengthen flight security in line with "international 
conventions." 
 
North Korea's Detention of a US Citizen 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the December 29 regularly scheduled Foreign Ministry press 
briefing, Spokesperson Jiang Yu commented on North Korea's detention 
of U.S. citizen Robert Park, stating that China hoped the United 
States, when addressing this issue, would uphold the larger issue of 
stability on the Korean Peninsula.  She referred journalists asking 
for additional information on China's position to the "relevant 
authorities." 
 
Execution of UK Citizen 
----------------------- 
 
¶3. Jiang refused to confirm details of the December 29 execution of 
UK citizen Akmal Shaikh for drug smuggling, despite claims that he 
suffered from mental disorders.  China is a country governed by the 
rule of law, Jiang said.  Judicial authorities are independent of 
the government and handled the situation in strict accordance with 
the law.  Asked why the government did not delay or stop the 
execution given reports of the prisoner's mental condition, Jiang 
responded that "China does not have the conditions to renounce the 
sentence (handed down by judicial authorities) but will mete out the 
sentence."  China noted British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's 
reaction to the execution with strong dissatisfaction.  China hoped 
the UK would squarely face what was an individual case not connected 
to broader issues, and Jiang expressed hope that this incident would 
not impair UK-PRC relations. 
 
¶4. Responding to repeated questions on the number of foreigners 
China had executed in the last 30 years and the number of foreigners 
that had faced criminal prosecution in China, Jiang asserted that 
the MFA had no such numbers and again referred journalists to 
"competent authorities" such as the Ministry of Justice and the 
Xinjiang Autonomous Region Foreign Affairs and Legal Affairs Office 
for further information.  Jiang asserted that this matter was 
outside the mandate of the MFA. 
 
Rescue of De Xin Hai Ship and Sailors 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. The Chinese-flagged De Xin Hai vessel, with its 25 crew members, 
was now under the protection of China's naval fleet and was on its 
way home, Jiang confirmed.  China places great importance on the 
safety of its citizens overseas.  China would look to enhance the 
naval fleet's ability to duly protect Chinese based overseas and its 
legitimate rights and interests abroad. 
 
Liu Xiaobo 
---------- 
 
¶6. China is handling the case of Liu Xiaobo publicly and in strict 
accordance to the law, Jiang asserted, when asked to comment on the 
U.S. government's response to the December 25 sentencing of Liu. 
Others should respect China's judicial system and judicial 
independence, Jiang said. 
 
Airline Security in Wake of NW 253 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7. China had taken note of the December 25 attempted bombing of US 
Northwest Airlines flight 253 and opposed any form of terrorism, 
Jiang declared.  In response, China was carrying out high level 
security checks on domestic and international flights, and was 
coordinating with the U.S. to strengthen security on flights in 
 
BEIJING 00003489  002 OF 002 
 
 
accordance with "international conventions." 
 
Burma's Release of Sailors 
-------------------------- 
 
¶8. Burma agreed to release one Mainland and four Taiwan sailors "at 
an early date" after fines were paid and at the behest of the 
Chinese government, Jiang confirmed in response to a question. 
Chinese officials have met with the fishermen and have asked Burmese 
authorities to provide appropriate medical treatment.  (Note: On 
November 18, Burma's navy detained 10 ships carrying 128 fishermen 
for illegal fishing.) 
 
Opposition to New Settlements in East Jerusalem 
---------------------------- ------------------ 
 
¶9. China opposed plans to build new Jewish settlements in annexed 
Arab East Jerusalem, Jiang affirmed, noting that this issue could 
only be resolved through negotiations between the Palestinian and 
Israeli sides.  China hoped Israel will squarely face "international 
requirements" and carry out policies in accordance with these 
requirements.
