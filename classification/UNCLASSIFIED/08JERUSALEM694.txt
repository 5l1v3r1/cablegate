SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (04/22): DOUBTS ABOUT 
NEGOTIATIONS, A CHANGED HAMAS? 
 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
The lead story in the three dailies quotes Hamas Leader Khaled 
Masha'al saying "Hamas will accept a state within the '67 borders 
along with a truce, but without recognizing Israel." This runs along 
side reports in the three dailies of comments made by former 
President Carter stating that in his talks with Hamas, they agreed 
to a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders if this is approved 
through a national referendum."  Other front-page stories quote 
Secretary Rice saying "Hamas must renounce violence as a step 
 
SIPDIS 
towards showing it actually wants peace." 
 
WAFA news agency reports that the Spokesperson for Palestinian 
President Abbas, Nabil Abu Rudaina, said the meeting between 
President Abbas and President Bush in Washington "would evaluate and 
tackle in detail the process of the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations." The dailies also carry a DPA story quoting Abu 
Rudaina as saying that "negotiations with Israel are going on 
without achieving any progress on any issues." 
 
In coverage of events in Gaza, the dailies carry prominent coverage 
of the deaths of three Palestinians in Gaza following an Israeli 
airstrike on April 21.  Related reports state a bombing took place 
in Gaza near the Al Dera Tourist hotel.  The reports state the 
attack was carried out by unknown gunmen who detonated a home-made 
bomb.  Al Quds also reports that another Gazan died after being 
unable to seek medical care outside of Gaza. 
 
Israeli authorities closed the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, Al Quds 
reports.  This was in order to "secure" the city for settler groups 
celebrating Passover, according to the report.  The dailies also 
note that Israeli authorities have closed the Old City of Jerusalem 
for the second day. 
 
President Abbas continued his visit to Tunisia, where he met with 
Tunisian President Ben Ali, all papers report. Al-Quds quotes Abbas 
saying "we reject postponing negotiations on any of the final status 
issues."  Other reports quote Ben Ali saying he will exert every 
effort to support the Palestinians. 
 
The front page of Al-Quds carries a report on a book published by a 
former State Department official, Aaron Miller, entitled "The Much 
Too Promised Land: America's Elusive Search for Arab-Israeli Peace." 
 In his book, the report notes, Miller argues that many ethnic 
groups have tried to influence U.S. foreign policy, but none have 
reached the effectiveness of Jewish Americans.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
¶1. Independent Al-Quds carries an op-ed by PLO executive committee 
member Tayseer Khaled entitled: "Annapolis conference launched 
problematic negotiations and ongoing settlements" that read in part: 
"... While it is true that Annapolis brought the two sides, 
Palestinians and Israelis, back to negotiations and that it gave 
these negotiations one year to reach an absolute solution to the 
conflict, widespread average Palestinian and Arab opinion does not 
reflect comfort or optimism with this decision for a number of 
reasons. One is that this conference set the Roadmap, which was 
approved by the Quartet in 2003, as a reference for these 
negotiations. It is known that the American government delayed 
 
JERUSALEM 00000694  002 OF 002 
 
 
adopting the Roadmap for a long time, so as not to let it distract 
the invasion of Iraq.... In reality what has been agreed on in 
Annapolis is that the parties should go back to the negotiating 
table after years of boycotting it, and that they should exert 
efforts to reach an agreement even though this requires, according 
to Bush's speech, painful compromises on both sides. Taking into 
consideration the realities that have been imposed on the ground by 
Israel, this is not likely to happen." 
 
¶2. Independent Al-Ayyam carries an op-ed by regular columnist Rajab 
Abu Sariah, entitled, "Once again... Gaza first" that reads: "... 
Even if we are going to question political language, we can say that 
Hamas changed its political speech. This was voiced clearly after 
Sana'a and after the Damascus summit, and is tied to several 
reasons. One of them is the fact that the Israelis have tightened 
the siege on Gaza as never before. This put Hamas in a real iron 
cage... It is ok [for Hamas] to reach an agreement after a bloody 
experience no matter the route, even if it is through a former 
American President.  [As the saying goes] if one wants grapes, he 
should not fight with the guards.  In this way things can move 
forward towards solutions for all pending issues."
