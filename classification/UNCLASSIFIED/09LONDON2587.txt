Per reftel, post conducted an inquiry on Mr. Opiela and a site visit to OMC International, Ltd. Post is unable to verify the bona fides of either Mr. Opiela or OMC International, Ltd. The address listed in reftel is a small storefront office with two desks; one for OMC International and a second one for a separate company. We were unable to contact Mr. Opiela but did speak with someone via telephone that said they were Mr. Opiela's accountant/assistant.  Post has received no response to the request for information.
