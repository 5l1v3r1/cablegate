SUBJECT: USG LEVEL OF REPRESENTATION DURING CERTAIN MEMBER 
STATES' PRESENTATIONS AT THE ROME UN FOOD SECURITY 
CONFERENCE 
 
 
¶1.  This cable provides guidance on USG level of 
representation during certain member states' official 
presentations during the June 3-5 UN Food Security 
Conference in Rome. 
 
¶2.  The Department understands that Iran, Venezuela, and 
Zimbabwe will be represented by their heads of state at 
the Rome conference and by the deputy-head of state in the 
case of Cuba.  The Department advises that senior-level 
USG officials on the U.S. delegation to the conference, 
including those at the level of Deputy Assistant Secretary 
or above should vacate "the U.S. chair," leaving only a 
note taker, during the presentations by Iran, Venezuela, 
Zimbabwe and Cuba. 
 
¶3.  If the statements by Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba 
specifically criticize the United States, the U.S. 
delegation may use its discretion to respond in a "right 
of reply" or a statement to the press afterwards. 
 
¶4.  For Zimbabwe, rather than exercise a right of reply, 
US del should coordinate prior to the session with 
like-minded delegations to join a walkout in the event 
Zimbabwe President Mugabe makes statements critical of the 
United States. 
 
¶5.  Senior USG officials may remain in the chair during 
all other presentations.
