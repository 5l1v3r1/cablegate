Secretary Clinton's remarks at the May 27 press conference with 
Egyptian Foreign Minister Abu Al-Ghayt in Washington wins lead 
 
coverage in all dailies.  Papers highlight Clinton stating that the 
U.S. will present a specific proposal to the Palestinians and Israel 
to move the peace process forward and that President Obama told 
Israeli Premier Netanyahu that all settlement activities must stop 
without exception.  Papers also highlight Clinton's remarks about 
U.S. commitment to a comprehensive, regional peace and two-state 
solution.  Al-Ayyam runs a front page photo of Clinton and Al-Ghayt 
speaking at the press conference. 
 
Al Hayat Al Jadida leads with wire coverage of Palestinian Authority 
(PA) President Abbas holding meetings in Washington on May 27 with 
Congressmen in preparation for his meeting with President Obama. 
All front pages cover the news that also notes Abbas' meeting with 
World Bank President Zoellick during which he discussed ways to 
"revive" the Palestinian economy and implement Gaza reconstruction. 
The World Bank pledged $55 million in support to the PA, according 
to all front pages. 
 
Al-Quds' front page reports on a May 27 Israeli military operation 
in Aranah village in the northern Jenin Governorate.  According to 
the story, Israeli military surrounded the village and attacked 
civilians. 
 
Al-Ayyam's front page cites Reuters in reporting on comments by 
Israeli Premier Netanyahu regarding Palestinian Authority President 
Abbas' visit to Washington.  The papers highlight Netanyahu's remark 
that pressure must also be exerted on the Palestinians to ensure 
that they meet their obligations under the American-backed peace 
plan.  Also according to coverage, Netanyahu pledged to respect 
international agreements that Israel has previously signed including 
the road map, and added that Israel wants to end the conflict. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs a front page op-ed by Nabil Amr, Palestinian 
Authority Ambassador to Egypt under the title "What Obama's promises 
might deliver."  The author questions Obama's chances of achieving 
peace in the region.  Please see block quotes for more.  Meanwhile, 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs an inside page op-ed under the byline of 
USAID Mission Director for the West Banka and Gaza Howard Sumka on 
the occasion of the International Day for Women's Health.  The State 
Department-drafted article highlights U.S. commitment to supporting 
the Palestinian health sector and Palestinian women's health. 
 
In economic news, Al-Quds runs inside coverage of the opening of a 
new branch of the Hirbawi Home Center store in Jenin city on May 27.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1)Nabil Amr, Palestinian Authority Ambassador to Egypt  opines in 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily under the title, "What Obama's 
promises might deliver" (05/28):  "All previous U.S. administrations 
agreed on a formula whereby they made enthusiastic promises to the 
Palestinians at the beginning of their terms and then made hollow 
apologies when they left office. ...Obama needs to realize that any 
delay in [moving the peace process forward]... is like giving 
Lieberman a gift by acknowledging that Lieberman has the upper hand 
in shaping U.S. Middle East policy... The coming weeks... will prove 
whether or not Obama's policy will yield any tangible results or if 
we will find ourselves saying, Et tu, Obama?

2) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title 
"Where is this Israeli extremism taking us?!" (05/28):  "No one 
disagrees that Israeli policies [influenced by] ... the Israeli 
extremist party will lead us to more violence and extremism and 
perhaps even an explosion.  The policy will also distance us from 
peace and stability more than at any previous time, unless someone 
puts a stop to it."
