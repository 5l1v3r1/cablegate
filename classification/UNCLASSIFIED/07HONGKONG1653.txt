1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information 
provided below is prohibited by Section 12C of the 
Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of 
the Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the 
USDOC Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), 
Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification at Keyence 
(HK) Electronics Hong Kong, Suite 713, Prudential 
Tower, 21 Canton Road, Tsimshatsui, Kowloon, Hong 
Kong (Keyence).  The item in question is a Genesis 
XM2 Imaging System exported to Keyence on or about 
February 22, 2007 and valued at USD 45,084.  On 
the applicable shippers export declaration (SED), 
the item is classified as 3A999.  Items properly 
classified as 3A999 may be exported/reexported to 
virtually all destinations and end-users 
worldwide, license free, except for certain 
designated state sponsors of terrorism (including 
North Korea).  The exporter was Edax, Inc. of 
Mahwah, New Jersey. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, 
Keyence has been in existence since 2001.  Its 
paid-up share capital is the Hong Kong equivalent 
of USD 600,000.  Japanese nationals, Michio Sasaki 
and Nobuaki Sugahara are listed as directors. 
Keyence is the Hong Kong affiliate office of 
Keyence Corporation, a Japanese listed company 
based in Osaka.  The company produces and 
distributes microscopes, sensors and other 
instruments used in industrial automation 
applications (more information at 
www.keyence.com). 
 
¶4.  On June 14, 2007, the ECO met with Mr. 
Sugahara, Director, and Ms. Christine Kee, 
assistant at the address referenced above.  ECO 
and FCS commercial assistants had been attempting 
to schedule a meeting with Mr. Sugahara for some 
time.  Mr. Sugahara apologized for the delay, 
explaining that he is often in mainland China on 
business.  Mr. Sugahara provided background 
information on Keyence (consistent with content on 
the company's web site).  He stated that Keyence 
customers in China are typically producers of 
integrated circuits, electronics components and 
automotive products. 
 
¶5.  As to the specific item in question, Mr. 
Sugahara provided copies of a delivery note 
indicating that the item had been delivered to 
Ushio Hong Kong Limited.  Mr. Sugahara stated that 
this company is also a Japanese listed company 
involved in production of light sources 
(www.ushio.com and www.ushio.com.jp).  Mr. 
Sugahara stated that the item would be used in the 
Hong Kong production facility of Ushio. 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, Keyence appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the commodities shipped (as 
reseller) since Keyence cooperated with the PSV 
and provided all requested information concerning 
the final disposition of the applicable items.  At 
the same time, the ECO was not able to inspect the 
subject items as they had already been delivered 
to Keyence's customer.  Consistent with guidance 
on reporting of PSVs where the items cannot be 
physically inspected, the ECO recommends that this 
PSV be classified as Limited.
