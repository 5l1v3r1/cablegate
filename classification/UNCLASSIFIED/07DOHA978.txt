Econoff forwarded information contained reftel to the Qatar 
Financial Information Unit (FIU) on October 4.  Once an 
Arabic translation via the EEB website is available, Post 
will forward it via diplomatic note to the FIU, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, and National Anti-Money Laundering and 
Terrorism Financing Committee.  Due to the limited working 
hours of our contacts during Ramadan, we have not received 
host government reaction.  Moreover, due to the upcoming Eid 
holiday (the GOQ is closed October 10-20), Post does not 
anticipate a timely substantive response to our message.
