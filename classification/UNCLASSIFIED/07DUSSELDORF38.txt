¶1.  (U) Summary:  A high profile Islamic terrorist trial opened 
before the Duesseldorf Higher Regional Court on December 18. 
With the help of an accomplice, Lebanese national Youssef 
Mohamad El-Hajdib, known as the "suitcase bomber," has been 
charged with attempted murder in an undetermined number of cases 
as well as attempting to cause an explosion by placing suitcases 
containing bombs (which failed to detonate) on two commuter 
trains in Cologne in July 2006.  According to the Federal 
Prosecutor, El-Hajdib and his accomplice acted in retaliation 
for the publication of Mohammed caricatures in the Danish and 
German press earlier that year.  A verdict in this case is 
expected in the summer of 2008.  The maximum sentence possible 
for these crimes is life imprisonment. End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Exactly sixteen months after his arrest in 
Schleswig-Holstein in August 2006, the trial against Youssef 
Mohamad El-Hajdib (DOB: 9/19/1984), a former engineering student 
at the University of Kiel, opened before the Duesseldorf Higher 
Regional Court.  The trial is held at a specially designed high 
security court house and presided over by Judge Otmar Breidling, 
widely recognized as one of Germany's most experienced judges in 
terrorism-related cases (reftels).  The charges were presented 
by Horst Salzmann, Chief Public Prosecutor at the Federal Court 
of Justice, on the first day of the trial on December 18. 
 
Retaliation for the Mohammed caricatures 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Salzmann, El-Hajdib conspired in April 
2006 with his Lebanese countryman Jihad Hammad (21), a Cologne 
resident at the time, to execute a terrorist bomb attack on the 
train system in Germany in retaliation for the publication of 
Mohammed caricatures in the Danish and German press earlier that 
year.  The original plan, according to a senior level law 
enforcement official, was to commit the crime during the 2006 
Soccer World Cup in Germany when hundreds of thousands of soccer 
fans were using public transportation systems to travel to the 
games.  According to media reports, however, heightened security 
measures during the World Cup caused the defendants to postpone 
their plans. 
 
Bombs fail to detonate 
---------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) As shown by evidence obtained through video monitoring 
cameras, on July 31, 2006 around 1 PM, Hajdib and Hammad placed 
suitcases containing IED's and incendiary material on north and 
south-bound commuter trains at the Cologne central railway 
station.  The prosecution argues that the bombs were to detonate 
simultaneously at 2:30 PM, but did not go off due to faulty 
construction, although the automatic fuse setting device was 
activated.  According to experts, a detonation would have caused 
a considerable shock wave and a fire ball that could have killed 
dozens of people.   (Note: Hammad fled to Lebanon following the 
bombing attempt and was arrested there.  A Beirut court charged 
both Hammad and Hajdib, in absentia, for their actions -- see 
para 6.) 
 
Verdict expected in summer 2008 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Thus far, 28 days of court hearings have been scheduled 
until the end of April.  The court spokesman indicated to us, 
however, that even more time will be needed to reach a verdict 
and therefore the court will come out with a new schedule for 
further hearings at the end of March.  He showed himself 
confident that the court would issue a verdict during the summer 
of 2008.  The maximum punishment for the crimes the defendant is 
charged with is life imprisonment. 
 
Beirut Court Sentences Hammad and Hajdib 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Independent from the Duesseldorf proceedings, media 
report that on December 18 a Beirut court sentenced Hajdib in 
abstentia to death for his involvement in the bombing plot. 
This judgment was subsequently reduced to life in prison. 
Assuming Hajdib is convicted by the Duesseldorf court and 
sentenced to prison, he could well face additional prison time 
in Lebanon upon completing his sentence in Germany.  The Beirut 
court sentenced Hammad to twelve years in prison. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) This case marks the first time in an Islamist terrorist 
 
DUSSELDORF 00000038  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
trial in Germany where the charges are attempted murder.  This 
has raised the profile of the case and some argue has made the 
threat of terrorism in Germany real.  The court's press 
spokesman told us that he expects a verdict in late summer 2008. 
 Based on the court's history and the thoroughness that 
Breidling exercises in his courtroom (reftel), we would not be 
surprised to see a decision come out later than expected -- 
perhaps fall of 2008.
