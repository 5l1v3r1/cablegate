Â¶1. (SBU) In reply to the Charge's letter of thanks, reftel, 
to Foreign Minister Smith for Australia's help in the release 
of AMCIT Roxana Saberi, Smith's Chief of Staff, Frances 
Adamson, wrote on June 9: Start text 
 
Thank you for your letter dated 15 May 2009 thanking the 
Government for its assistance in relation to Ms Roxana 
Saberi. Mr Smith has asked me to reply to you on his behalf. 
 
The Australian Government was pleased to be able offer 
assistance in the case of Ms Saberi. The decision of the 
Iranian Revolutionary Court to reduce her sentence and to 
allow her to leave Iran was no doubt an enormous relief to Ms 
Saberi and her family. 
 
In relation to the other two cases you mention, Australia's 
former Ambassador to Iran, Mr Greg Moriarty, raised the case 
of Mr Levinson with relevant Iranian ministries. Iranian 
officials advised they had no information relating to Mr 
Levinson's whereabouts. 
 
The Government will continue to take appropriate 
opportunities to raise Mr Levinson's case, as well as the 
case of Ms Momeni, with the Government of Iran. End text.
