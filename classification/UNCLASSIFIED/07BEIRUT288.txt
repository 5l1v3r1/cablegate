Polchief delivered reftel demarche on the upcoming meeting of 
the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs to Oussama Khacchab, 
Americas Desk Officer at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who 
promised to pass the demarche points to relevant officials at 
the Ministry of Health and in Lebanon's UN delegations.  It 
is worth noting that both the Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
the Minister of Health resigned last November, have not been 
replaced, and that both ordinary business and policymaking at 
both ministries have been compromised by Lebanon's ongoing 
political crisis.
