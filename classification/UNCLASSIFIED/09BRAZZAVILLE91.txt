SUBJECT: CONGO/BRAZZAVILLE - DEMARCHE DELIVERED ON AFGHANISTAN AND 
PAKISTAN STRATEGIC REVIEW 
 
REF: STATE 29482 
 
¶1. Per reftel, EmbOff met with Daniel Owassa, Secretary General, 
Chef du Cabinet, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the 
Republic of the Congo (ROC).  Talking points regarding the new 
strategy for meeting the challenges in Afghanistan and Pakistan 
were presented to Owassa. 
 
¶2. In response, Owassa commented that the increase in troop 
levels might overshadow the increased diplomatic and development 
efforts called for in the new strategy.  Owassa suggested the 
real war against terror would be fought in the hearts and minds 
of the Afghan and Pakistani people.  According to his 
assessment, as long as the U.S. was perceived as an occupying 
force there would always be new volunteers ready to join the 
Taliban.  EmbOff responded that development could not succeed in 
the absence of security and reminded Owassa of the important 
development role played by military forces.
