REF: FREETOWN 321 
 
¶1. President Koroma is currently enjoying the first ever 
Sierra Leonean state visit to Brazil after landing in 
Brasilia on August 18. Accompanied by the Ministers of 
Foreign Affairs, Information, and Agriculture, Koroma will 
meet with President Lula da Silva on August 19 to sign a 
Memorandum of Understanding and other agreements to cement 
the diplomatic relationship between the two countries and 
make way for the start of construction on a Sierra Leonean 
embassy. According a press statement, Koroma will also meet 
with the Presidents of the Senate, the House of 
Representatives, and the Supreme Court. He will also visit 
the Embrapa Agricultural Research Agency before leaving for 
Rio de Janeiro on August 20. 
 
¶2. Koroma met with representatives from the 28 African 
diplomatic missions represented in Brasilia on August 18, and 
emphasized the strong historical and cultural bonds between 
Brazil and the African continent. The President told the 
representatives that Africa should seek closer ties to Brazil 
since "our people are the same." He then gave the diplomats a 
snapshot of the current state of affairs in Sierra Leone, 
highlighting the peaceful elections in 2007 and the "Agenda 
for Change" development strategy that prioritizes 
agriculture, energy, infrastructure, and social services. He 
also spoke about regional cooperation, focusing on the 
revitalization of the Mano River Union (MRU) and strengthened 
collaboration within ECOWAS and the AU (Note: In discussing 
the MRU, Koroma was careful to point out that they are 
supporting Guinea "to see her through this difficult time - 
and not shy away - but to ensure they meet their democratic 
commitments." End Note). He informed the group of the African 
Caucus of Finance Ministers and Bank Governors that Sierra 
Leone hosted (reftel) August 11-14. Koroma was warmly 
welcomed by the Dean of the African Diplomatic Corps, Thomas 
Bvuma from Zimbabwe, who also praised President Lula by 
saying "he makes our work easier by having a special interest 
in African affairs. We believe this special relationship 
reflects President Lula's genuine interest in Africa to 
develop partnership with our countries." 
 
¶3. Comment: Sierra Leone has been working for some time to 
establish a diplomatic mission in Brazil, and a meeting with 
Foreign Minister Bangura some months ago revealed that the 
Brazilian government will be paying for its construction. 
Brazil does not have a representative based in Freetown, but 
we understand that this is also being considered. Areas of 
partnership and collaboration, particularly within the 
agricultural sector, will no doubt benefit Sierra Leone 
tremendously. End Comment.
