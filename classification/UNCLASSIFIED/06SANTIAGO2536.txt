SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - IRAQ STUDY GROUP REPORT 
 
¶1. On December 7, conservative, independent "La Tercera" (circ. 
101,000) ran an editorial entitled, "Change of Strategy in the War 
in Iraq."  Quotes: 
 
¶2. "The results of the Baker-Hamilton Commission were released.... 
The tone of the document...concurs with that of the new Secretary of 
Defense, who said the United States is losing the war. 
 
¶3. "A dispassionate analysis of the situation in Iraq shows that 
violence...is preventing the state from functioning, has virtually 
paralyzed the country, and is undermining reconstruction efforts. 
The bipartisan panel...acknowledges this..., reaffirms the view that 
an immediate and unilateral withdrawal would leave a vacuum that 
could worsen violence, admits that the U.S. by itself cannot put an 
end to that violence..., and is emphatic that foreign elements such 
as Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups are not responsible for this 
violence....  It is positive that the White House itself 
commissioned the report, because it shows a willingness not to 
insist on an unsuccessful strategy....  The White House said it 
would study the Commission's proposal, but noted that there is a 
similar Pentagon report that must be considered.  No one is 
suggesting hasty actions, but the prognosis is widely known and 
sufficiently strong to launch a change in strategy.  The 
Baker-Hamilton proposals are not easy to implement, but do show the 
need for a strong change in direction on how the United States 
addresses the conflict in Iraq."
