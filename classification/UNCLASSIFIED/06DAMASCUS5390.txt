SUBJECT: COUNTRY CLEARANCE FOR CODEL DODD, DECEMBER 19-21 
 
REF: SECSTATE 197558 
 
¶1. (U) Embassy Damascus welcomes and grants country 
clearance for the visit of Senator Christopher Dodd, and the 
other members of his delegation: Ms. Janice O'Connell (SFRC), 
and COL Mike Barbero, U.S. Army Senate Liaison. 
 
¶2. (U) Control officer and point of contact for this visit 
is Pol/Econ Counselor Todd Holmstrom, who can be reached at 
work: (963)-(11) 3391-4287; cell: (963) 094-270-556; home: 
(963)-(11) 611-3237; or embassy fax number: (963)-(11) 
3391-3999. 
 
¶3. (U) Fiscal Information:  Thank you for the fiscal data 
for the costs of the visit.  Costs include, but are not 
limited to, American and FSN overtime, border crossing 
fees, field travel by Embassy employees, transportation 
costs for official vehicles, long distance telephone calls, 
equipment rentals, representational events, and other costs 
directly attributable to the visit. 
 
¶4. (U) Visa Requirement: Every traveler must have a valid 
Syrian visa prior to departure for Damascus. The Syrian 
government will not normally grant airport or border visas. 
Travelers should apply for visas well in advance, as 
processing time is often slow. Currently, Syrian visas for 
Americans can only be issued by the Syrian Embassy in 
Washington.  Persons traveling on passports bearing an 
Israeli visa or entry or exit stamp, or persons born in the 
Gaza region or of Gazan descent, will be refused entry to 
Syria.  The Syrian government rigidly enforces restrictions 
on prior travel to Israel. Israeli stamps in passports, 
Jordanian entry cachets, or cachets from Egypt or other 
countries that suggest prior travel to Israel, may cause 
Syrian immigration authorities to refuse the traveler 
admission to Syria. Likewise, the absence of entry stamps 
from a country adjacent to Israel, which the traveler has 
just visited, will cause Syrian immigration officials to 
refuse admittance. American citizen travelers suspected of 
having traveled to Israel have been detained for 
questioning. 
 
¶5. (U) Security Requirements:  Post did not see security 
clearances for the delegation in the country clearance 
request, which should be provided via e-mail or cable. 
 
¶6. (U) Transportation:  Controloff and an embassy expediter 
will meet Senator Dodd and the other members of his 
delegation 
on December 19 at the Damascus airport.  Post will also 
arrange for transportation to and from official meetings. 
Controloff and expediter will see Senator Dodd and his 
delegation off at the Damascus airport on December 21. 
 
¶7.  (U) Accommodation: reservations were made for the 
delegation at the Four Seasons for December 19-21. 
Confirmation numbers are 131770, 131772, 131774.  Hotel 
telephone number is 963 (11) 339-1000, fax: 963 (11) 
339-1009.  The daily room rate is USD 110, plus 10 percent 
service charge, and 11 percent tax, breakfast not included. 
The maximum time granted for free cancellation is six p.m. on 
the day of arrival. 
 
¶8. (U) Communications Support: Post will provide Senator 
Dodd and other members of his delegation with an 
international cell phone for official use while 
in-country.  Long-distance telephone calls can also be 
placed from the Embassy.  The internet can be accessed 
through a stand-alone PC in the Embassy. There is no charge 
for this service.  The internet can also be accessed from 
hotels in Damascus by dialing to one of three different 
ISP's in Syria. 
 
¶9. (U) Currency Exchange: As the delegation will overnight in 
Damascus (per reftel), Post will disburse per diem to the 
delegation for December 19 and 20.  The Embassy Class B 
Cashier provides exchange from dollars to Syrian pounds at 
the current rate for 
institutions, against cash, traveler's checks, and, with 
the authorization of the financial management officer, 
personal checks. Reverse accommodation exchange is not 
authorized, in accordance with Syrian government 
regulations.  Personal checks cannot be cashed on the final 
day of the employee's stay.  The last check must be 
presented at least one day before departure.  Travelers can 
also purchase pounds at branches of the Commercial Bank of 
Syria.  It is illegal to exchange money except at 
authorized exchange points (i.e., the Embassy and branches 
of the Commercial Bank). 
 
¶10. (U) Photography:  Photography of individuals in uniform 
(including police), government buildings, and military 
installations is strictly forbidden. 
 
¶11. (U) Departure Tax:  Syria charges a departure tax of 
SP200 (approximately $4), payable in SP cash only. 
Travelers with diplomatic passports are exempt, but those 
with official passports must pay. 
 
¶12. (U) Health:  Health facilities in Damascus are not up 
to U.S. or European standards, and facilities outside 
Damascus are extremely limited.  Only personnel covered 
under the State Department's medical program and with a 
valid medical clearance for Syria are eligible for medevac 
at USG cost.  It is recommended that all other travelers 
have medical evacuation insurance sufficient to cover 
evacuation by chartered air ambulance, or ensure that their 
agency will cover the cost. 
 
¶13. (U) Threat Assessment:  Political developments and 
security in the Middle East sometimes change quickly. The 
Embassy was attacked, without warning, in September 2006, 
by a small group of terrorists using automatic gunfire and 
grenades. They attempted, unsuccessfully, to detonate a 
vehicle-borne improvised explosive device at the real gate. 
One local guard was seriously injured and there was at 
least one Syrian fatality in addition to the killing of the 
four attackers.  Since the attack, the Embassy has taken 
additional measures to improve its security posture. 
 
In February 2005, the former Prime Minister of Lebanon was 
assassinated in Beirut, prompting the U.S. to recall its 
Ambassador to Syria for consultations.  There are no plans 
to assign a replacement, reflecting the ongoing 
difficulties in U.S.-Syrian relations. 
Government-sanctioned demonstrations have occasionally 
included expressions of anti-American or anti-Western 
sentiment. Violent mobs attacked three Scandinavian 
embassies in February 2006. 
 
In general, Americans in Syria should vary their schedules, 
avoid large crowds and gatherings, and report suspicious 
incidents to the Regional Security Officer.  They should 
also avoid electronic financial transactions and should not 
carry valuables or large amounts of cash in crowded 
shopping districts.  Visitors should also read and follow 
the guidance in the latest public announcements and State 
Department travel advisories for Syria.
