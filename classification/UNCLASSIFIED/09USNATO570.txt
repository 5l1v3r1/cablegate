(U) The December 3-4 NATO Foreign Ministerial was a success, 
with the U.S. getting everything it wanted, and then some. 
The Ministerial Statement and the separate ISAF statement on 
Afghanistan were reported in reftels.  Some of the highlights 
included: 
 
- Allies strongly endorsed President Obama's approach toward 
Afghanistan, with 25 countries pledging to do more in terms 
of troops, trainers, and trust fund monies.  Allies and ISAF 
partners pledged to contribute about 7,000 troops, and 
several thousand more will likely be forthcoming in the near 
future.  ISAF countries also began a discussion on improving 
civilian coordination, with an eye to agreeing on new 
mechanisms by the time of the London Conference. 
 
- Allies embraced the President's Phased, Adaptive Approach 
to Missile Defense in language that is stronger in places 
than what we originally proposed.  Statements by ministers on 
missile defense were universally strong and welcoming. 
 
- Allies agreed to provide MAP to Montenegro and reached a 
compromise on Bosnia that enables Sarajevo to get MAP once it 
achieves the necessary progress in its reform efforts. 
Reaching this consensus was difficult, but in the end Turkey 
and its allies agreed to support the compromise. 
 
- NATO countries and Russia formally restarted the 
NATO-Russia Council by convening the first formal Ministerial 
meeting since December 2007.  The NRC Ministers agreed to 
restructure the NRC, launch a joint review of 21st Security 
Challenges, and a Work Program for 2010. 
 
Because of these successes, the road to the Lisbon Summit 
next November looks brighter than it did only a few days ago.
