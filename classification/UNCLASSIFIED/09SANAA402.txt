SUBJECT: EMBASSY SANAA 2009 SCIENCE FELLOW PROPOSAL 
 
REF: STATE 10843 
 
¶1. Embassy Sanaa proposes the following spring/summer 
position for a Science Fellow. 
 
¶2. Topic: Geological Survey Capacity-Building in Yemen. 
 
-- Relevant host country organizations: Geological Survey and 
Mineral Resource Board, Ministry of Oil and Minerals, 
Ministry of Water and Irrigation, and Ministry of Higher 
Education and Scientific Research. 
 
-- Timeframe and length of fellowship: Late spring/summer 
2010, for 3-5 months. 
 
-- Medical clearance needed. 
 
-- Skills: Arabic language skills preferable but not 
required; experience working and living abroad, especially in 
the developing world, preferably but not required. 
 
-- Security clearance: A secret-level security clearance is 
required because Fellow will be working as an integral part 
of the Embassy's Political/Economic Section, will regularly 
advise the Section's chief on scientific matters, and will 
attend staff and other meetings in the Embassy's controlled 
access area. 
 
¶3. Position description: The Fellow will serve as one of 
eight officers in the Political/Economic Section, responsible 
for the Section's reporting and analysis of scientific 
affairs in Yemen, especially matters involving geology. 
Yemen has a nascent mining industry, a potential for serious 
water shortages in the future, and an underdeveloped oil 
sector.  The Fellow will work closely with the 
above-mentioned host country organizations on issues such as 
groundwater and surface water quality monitoring, subsurface 
mineral and energy resource assessment, and developing and 
using geological data-sharing systems. 
 
¶4. Position description continued: He/she will also advise 
the Political/Economic Section, the Embassy's Front Office, 
and USAID on ways to improve the U.S. Government's engagement 
with Yemeni institutions on scientific matters.  The Fellow 
will also contribute to the Section's reporting and analysis 
of economic, energy, health, and technology, and complete 
other tasks as assigned.  Yemen is a challenging but 
potentially very rewarding environment.  The Fellow will have 
chance to make a real contribution to the country's 
geological survey capacity and be able to meet with senior 
Yemeni government officials involved in scientific and energy 
matters on a regular basis. 
 
¶5. Post will provide housing, office support, and in-country 
travel arrangements, within the Embassy security regulations 
on in-country travel. 
 
¶6. RSO concurrence: The Embassy's Regional Security Officer 
has cleared this Science Fellow proposal.
