Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. On October 2, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees' (UNHCR) Deputy Representative for Sudan Craig Sanders 
briefed international donors, including USAID, on UNHCR's funding 
situation for the remainder of 2007.  In addition, UNHCR discussed 
progress in expanding Darfur operations and the cluster system as it 
applies -- or in this case does not apply -- to Sudan. UNHCR 
continues to pursue an agreement with the Government of National 
Unity's (GNU) Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) to expand operations 
into North and South Darfur states.  Since early 2007, USAID and 
other donors have pressed UNHCR to assume responsibility for 
internally displaced person (IDP) camp coordination and protection 
sectors throughout Darfur.  UNHCR reiterated its commitment to 
expanding operations from West Darfur to North and South Darfur and 
reported that despite some progress on the issue, Sudanese 
government obstructionism still prevails.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
UNHCR Sudan Programs Facing Funding Shortfall 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. Recently, UNHCR issued two press releases, one on Darfur and one 
on Southern Sudan, stating that UNHCR is facing a critical funding 
shortfall for its programs in Sudan.  The UNHCR representative noted 
that while there is a real funding shortfall for the Sudan program, 
the press releases are also intended to alert donors and the 
international community to the situation in hopes of raising the 
needed funds.  The representative mentioned that programs are not 
being cut at the moment, but emphasized that further funding is 
required to meet stated objectives. 
 
¶3. According to budget tables presented to the donors, UNHCR's 
Darfur programs have received USD 13 million out of a USD 19.7 
million requested program budget for 2007.  UNHCR's Southern Sudan 
operations have received only USD 45 million out of a USD 56 million 
requested budget.  The UNHCR representative confirmed that the 
figures presented did not include recent USAID funding for FY 2007, 
which totals USD 2 million to support protection programs for IDPs 
in Darfur and the establishment and staffing up of UNHCR offices in 
North and South Darfur.  Other pledged donor commitments, which 
would reduce the overall funding shortfall for Darfur, were also not 
reflected in the tables. 
 
¶4. The UNHCR representative noted that the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) is also facing funding shortfalls 
for its returns programs.  In FY 2007, USAID provided USD 2 million 
to support IOM's activities in Darfur and USD 4.5 million for IOM's 
activities in Khartoum and Southern Sudan.  UNHCR and IOM plan to 
convene a donor meeting under the auspices of the UN Mission in 
Sudan's Return Reintegration and Recovery Section (UNMIS RRR) to 
discuss funding issues for the returns programs.  At this meeting, 
the two agencies plan to present donors with a prioritization of 
urgent needs. 
 
------------------ 
Impact on Programs 
------------------ 
 
¶5.  UNHCR was very clear that it is not pulling out of Darfur or 
closing programs.  However, the Darfur and Southern Sudan programs 
are supplementary budgets, meaning that programs are implemented 
only after UNHCR receives the funds. 
 
¶6.  When asked how the funding shortfall would impact programs, the 
UNHCR representative stated that it would look at implementation 
rates of partners to cut costs, have staff depart post early and 
leave posts unfilled to reduce costs, and tighten administrative 
budgets.  If the funding is not secured in the next few months, 
UNHCR will have to begin "putting the brakes" on programs. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
No Progress in Expanding Presence in Darfur 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  The UNHCR representative reported that the HAC continues to 
 
KHARTOUM 00001602  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
block plans to expand operations from West Darfur to North and South 
Darfur.  Despite repeated meetings with HAC, UNHCR reported no 
success in negotiating a memorandum of understanding to operate in 
the two states. (Note: UNHCR currently has an agreement to operate 
in only West Darfur. End Note.)  In the meetings, HAC repeatedly 
criticized UNHCR's lack of assistance to alleged returns in Darfur. 
(Comment:  The HAC claims that as many as 80 villages have received 
recent returns, but IOM and other agencies have conducted missions 
to verify these claims in several locations and found no returnees. 
To date, only three areas in South Darfur have been deemed as 
legitimate returns areas by IOM.  End Comment.)  UNHCR continues to 
meet with HAC to gain agreement on the expansion. 
 
¶8.  In the absence of UNHCR, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(OCHA) are struggling to coordinate Darfur's IDP camps.  This 
exposes NGO's and OCHA to constant harassment and obstructionism 
from Sudanese government authorities who view camp coordination as 
inherently a government function.  UNHCR's current situation with 
the government is ambiguous, but it is moving ahead with expansion 
plans in Darfur even without explicit government approval.  The 
Sudanese government has stated that they are waiting to assess 
UNHCR's program in West Darfur before giving the green light for 
UNHCR to operate in North and South Darfur.  Despite numerous 
attempts and requests on the part of UNHCR for the government to 
meet with and assess UNHCR's program in West Darfur, the government 
has yet to assess the program. 
 
¶9.  UNHCR also reported that the newly arrived Deputy Special 
Representative to the UN Secretary General Ameerah Haq is very 
engaged on the issue of UNHCR expansion and may pursue a UNHCR 
request to demarche GNU officials on UNHCR's behalf.  Haq will 
likely present the issue as part of a UN reorganization linked to 
the deployment of UN-AU Mission in Darfur (UNAMID).  An argument 
will be made that with protection and camp management falling 
outside of the UNAMID mandate, UNHCR will need to become operational 
in all three states.  Sanders described negotiations with the HAC as 
a "grueling process."  The UNHCR representative noted that OCHA and 
other UN agencies are fully supportive of UNHCR assuming these 
responsibilities. 
 
--------------------- 
Managing Expectations 
--------------------- 
 
¶10.  UNHCR conveyed to the donors a need to manage expectations 
around UNHCR's expanding presence in Darfur.  While UNHCR is 
confident that it can make marked improvements in the protection and 
camp management sectors, the representative noted that it will be 
arriving on the scene under extremely difficult circumstances and 
expects Sudanese government obstructionism to continue.  These 
difficult circumstances will hinder UNHCR's ability to become fully 
operational immediately. 
 
¶11.  UNHCR reported that in anticipation of obtaining GNU agreement 
to operate in North and South Darfur, it has redeployed two 
experienced Darfur staff to assist with camp coordination in 2008. 
UNHCR is preparing to assume these new responsibilities, but most of 
the work is internal at this point, including completing all the 
bureaucratic procedures to open offices, hire staff, and secure 
appropriate funding.
