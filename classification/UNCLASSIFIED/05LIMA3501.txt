SUBJECT: RESULTS REPORT: DVC "FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE REPORTING FOR 
OFFICIALS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH" -- TRACKER 24282 
 
 
¶1.   As part of Post's efforts to aid the Peruvian government in 
their anti-corruption initiatives, PAS Lima organized a DVC on 
Financial Disclosure Reporting on 4 August.  U.S. speaker, Carol 
¶E. Dixon, Counsel of the House of Representatives Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct, shared information with Genaro 
Matute, Peru's Comptroller General, Ana Mara Risi, Head of the 
Financial Disclosure Bureau and the Comptroller's financial 
disclosure unit on how the ethics program and the financial 
disclosure system are run in the U.S. legislative branch.  The 
DVC was a follow-up on programs conducted with Barbara Mullen- 
Roth, Office of Government Ethics last November and Hiram Morales 
from the Puerto Rican OGE in July. 
 
¶2. Carol Dixon's participation was excellent.  During her 30- 
minute presentation, Ms. Dixon gave an overview of the 
legislative ethics program and the functions of the Committee on 
Standards of Official Conduct.  She also provided information 
regarding laws, rules, regulations, and other standards of 
conduct for House of Representatives members and employees.  Ms. 
Dixon stressed that it was essential to keep civil society 
informed about the public official's financial interests in order 
to increase the confidence in the government. At the end of the 
program, the Comptroller General indicated that his office will 
implement several procedures to improve the Peruvian financial 
disclosure system based on the information provided during the 
event. 
 
¶3. Results: As a result of Post's extensive programming with the 
Comptroller's office, they have introduced a bill to Congress to 
modify the Constitution which would give the Comptroller's office 
access to public servant's confidential bank and tax information. 
A second bill will be introduced to set an annual fixed date when 
financial disclosure reports must be filed and to require that 
government officials file reports within 30 days of their 
termination date. This bill will also set up administrative 
sanctions such as late filing fees for those who fail to submit 
their reports or submit them without meeting the established 
terms and conditions. 
 
¶4. Audience Size: 35 staff members of the Financial Disclosure 
Bureau attended the program. 
 
¶5. Quality of U.S. support and IIP offices involved: 
Excellent/Outstanding - Our thanks to Gretchen Christison and DVC 
team for their close coordination with post and flexibility to 
test Lima's translation equipment.
