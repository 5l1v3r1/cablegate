SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S. ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage October 15 on developments in cross-Strait relations, and 
the year-end city mayors' and country magistrates' elections in 
Taiwan.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, an op-ed in the 
mass-circulation "Apple Daily" discussed the U.S. National Defense 
Authorization Bill, which was recently passed by the U.S. Congress, 
and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.  The article said the fact that U.S. 
President Barack Obama has yet to express his stance on U.S. arms 
sales to Taiwan indicates that Obama still has doubts about the 
development of cross-Strait relations.  End summary. 
 
"Obama Being a Drag on Ma Ying-jeou" 
 
Professor Emerson Chang, Director of Nan Hua University's Department 
of International Studies, opined in the mass-circulation "Apple 
Daily" [circulation: 520,000] (10/15): 
 
"A joint congressional session of the U.S. Congress recently passed 
the finalized version of the '2010 National Defense Authorization 
Bill,' in which Article No. 1226, which has been approved separately 
by the Senate and the House three months ago, was removed -- a rare 
move indeed.  This article is related to strengthening Taiwan's air 
force, and its sudden deletion not only will cast a shadow over 
Taiwan-U.S. relations but will also generate a profound impact on 
the security in East Asia. ...  This provision was removed while a 
final version [of the bill] was being discussed at the joint 
congressional session, and [the bill] was passed by Congress and 
will take effect soon with the approval of the U.S. president.  This 
development must be a result of the strategic and diplomatic 
maneuvering of the White House.  During the 'U.S.-China Strategic 
and Economic Dialogue' in late July, [U.S. President Barack] Obama 
emphasized that he had great hopes for Sino-U.S. cooperation on 
financial, trade, environmental protection, health, military, 
anti-terrorism and non-nuclear proliferation issues.  During his 
planned trip to Asia in November, Obama will visit China for the 
first time.  In order to create a good ambiance for Sino-U.S. 
cooperation, [we have also seen] similar moves [from the United 
States] such as postponing the sale of three weapons systems to 
Taiwan (the submarine design, general purpose helicopters, and two 
sets of PAC III missiles), refusing to meet with the Dalai Lama, and 
stopping the Congress from pushing for arms sales to Taiwan. ... 
 
"... It has been nearly a year since Obama took over the helm, but 
the procrastination [over U.S.] arms sales [to Taiwan] has become a 
normal state.  Along with stalled Taiwan-U.S. relations, it appears 
that the United States is re-evaluating and re-defining its 
interests in East Asia.  Obama's move to stop the Congress from 
taking action [to push for U.S. arms sales to Taiwan] was not simply 
an action based on his personal considerations -- namely, to prevent 
the room for his strategic planning as a president from being 
restricted; instead, it has something to do with China's rise and 
the United States' need to work with China on certain international 
issues.  Nonetheless, how the Ma administration has been sizing up 
and adjusting its relations with the United States and with China 
also played a critical role. ... The fact that Obama has yet to 
express his stance on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and his move to stop 
the Congress from doing so indicates that there are still doubts on 
Obama's side regarding cross-Strait relations and the importance of 
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.  Washington's doubts will likely 
increase rather than decrease if the Ma administration chooses to 
downplay the issue."
