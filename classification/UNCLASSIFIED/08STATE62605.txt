SUBJECT: U.S. STATEMENT FOR UNSC INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS ON 
ZIMBABWE JUNE 12 
 
 
¶1.  This is an action request.  USUN may draw from the 
talking points in para 2 below during UNSC informal 
consultations on the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe on 
June 12.  USUN should also draw on these points in speaking 
to the press after the consultations. 
 
¶2.  Begin talking points: 
 
-- We appreciate U/SYG Pascoe,s briefing on the worsening 
humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe.  We are deeply troubled 
by the downward spiral in the welfare of the Zimbabwean 
people as a result of government-sanctioned violence against 
opposition leaders and supporters and government restrictions 
on the operations of NGOs. 
 
-- Since the March 29 election, 54 people have been murdered 
for the mere suspicion of supporting the opposition, hundreds 
have been arrested, and tens of thousands have been injured 
or forced to flee their homes. 
 
-- On June 5, the Zimbabwean government extended its campaign 
of intimidation to NGOs, indefinitely suspending their 
operations and thereby turning its back on the humanitarian 
needs of its own people. 
 
-- The government has even begun to use food relief as a 
political weapon to achieve favorable election results.  On 
June 6, Manicaland Governor Chugudu, "war vets," military, 
and police hijacked a truck hired by Catholic Relief Services 
and diverted 20 metric tons of U.S. Government humanitarian 
food destined for hungry school children to ZANU-PF 
supporters assembled at a 
political rally in Mutare. 
 
-- We welcome the UN Country Team,s June 6 Statement on the 
Deteriorating Humanitarian Situation, and join the UN in 
calling on the Government of Zimbabwe to immediately rescind 
the decision to suspend PVO/NGO field operations and to allow 
access of basic humanitarian assistance to vulnerable 
populations throughout the country. 
 
-- We fear the situation will only get worse in the days 
leading to the June 27 election, with inevitable humanitarian 
and political consequences for Zimbabwe,s neighbors.  The 
effects of the Zimbabwean government's policies are already 
being felt throughout the region.  For example, people of 
Mozambican and Malawian origins living and working in 
Zimbabwe have in many cases been forced to return to their 
countries.  And in South Africa, Zimbabweans who are fleeing 
to escape economic collapse and political unrest have been 
the target of vicious anti-foreigner attacks.  The situation 
is clearly threatening stability in the region. 
 
-- We have supported and continue to support African efforts 
to resolve the crisis.  Unfortunately, there is no indication 
to date that President Mugabe or his senior leadership is 
listening.  We hope that Assistant Secretary General Haile 
Menkerios will be received by President Mugabe and permitted 
to work unhindered in facilitating a free and fair election. 
 
-- We believe a free and fair Presidential election on June 
27 is vital to the stability of Zimbabwe and of the region 
and believe the Security Council must remain engaged as the 
election date approaches.
