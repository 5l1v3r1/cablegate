In Today's Papers 
 
Governor: Ankara Bombing Suicide Attack 
All papers report Ankara Governor Kemal Onal told the press the 
suicide attacker who killed six people and injured around 100 others 
on Tuesday evening was Guven Akkus, a 28-year-old man who spent two 
years in prison for activities in relation to his membership in an 
illegal leftist organization, the Turkish Revolutionary Communist 
Union (TIKB).  Akkus became affiliated with the PKK in prison.  He 
spent eight years abroad and returned to Turkey to carry out the 
bombing. 
 
The suicide bombing in Ankara was originally planned to occur 
simultaneously with another attack in Istanbul, say papers, 
reporting the police detained a woman preparing for a suicide bomb 
attack in a home in the Umraniye neighborhood.  Seven other suspects 
were also taken into custody.  Adana Governor Ilhan Atis said a 
woman who was detained Wednesday in the southern city of Adana had 
planned to carry out a suicide attack.  Atis said the woman, seized 
while trying to escape in a car, had 11.3 kg of explosives, two hand 
bombs and 12 detonators in her bag. 
 
No group has claimed responsibility for the Ankara bombing so far. 
Former Kurdish MPs Selim Sadak and Hatip Dicle, board members of 
Turkey's main Kurdish party DTP, condemned the attack and called for 
reason from everybody.  Islamist-oriented Zaman reports Firat News 
Agency, an internet news agency close to the PKK, posted a statement 
by the Koma Komalen Kurdistan (KKK) chairmanship council that "they 
have no relation with the explosion" in Ankara, adding the attack 
would be used to justify a cross-border military incursion into 
northern Iraq. 
 
Editorial Commentary on the Ankara Bombing 
Ruhat Mengi writes in the mainstream daily Vatan: "The US Embassy 
statement after the terrorist bombing in Ankara expressed 'shock.' 
The fact of the matter is that we have been in shock for quite 
sometime and it is because of their biased attitude.  It was the US 
who sat aside and did not help to resolve the PKK problem when it 
was really needed.  And it was the US who gave support to Iraqi 
Kurds and the PKK, which helped encourage the terrorist organization 
even more.  The EU is even worse than the US - giving support to 
every PKK linked organization." 
 
Fikret Bila says in the mainstream daily Milliyet: "Terrorism 
continues to claim lives of innocent people and the outside support 
for the PKK is documented, and Turkey gets suggestions for working 
on dialogue and political solution.  This is totally unacceptable. 
Turkey is treated with an obvious double standard on issues of 
terror and terrorism.  The US uses time-gaining tactics regarding 
terrorist attacks coming from northern Iraq, while the same US 
sought international cooperation in the aftermath of the 9/11 
attacks." 
 
Dogan Tilic comments in the leftist, pro-Kurdish daily Birgun: "The 
bombing in Ankara will give support to those in favor of a cross 
border operation in Northern Iraq against the PKK presence there. 
This act will also change the political rhetoric especially on the 
eve of the general elections.  Following such terrorist attacks 
security becomes an extremely high priority, as fear gradually 
surrounds the entire society.  Demands for security supersede 
demands for democracy.  The 9/11 climate is a typical example of 
that.  The fact of the matter is that when democracy and freedoms 
are sacrificed in the name of security, we will eventually be less 
secure than ever before." 
 
Erdogan: Parliament will Support Cross-border Action against 
Northern Iraq 
All papers report Prime Minister Erdogan said if there was a request 
from the Turkish military for a cross-border operation into northern 
Iraq, the parliament would support it.  In televised remarks,

Erdogan, in response to a question on whether an operation into 
northern Iraq could be carried out "despite the US," said the US is 
Turkey's political ally.  "The US should take the necessary measures 
against the presence of the terrorist organization in northern Iraq. 
 Turkey will decide on its own when the time comes," said the PM. 
 
Turkish Special Iraqi Envoy to Visit Iraq This Weekend 
Hurriyet, Milliyet:  An MFA delegation led by Special Envoy 
Ambassador Oguz Celikkol will leave for Iraq this the weekend.  The 
delegation is expected to give Iraq a strong verbal warning to bring 
an end to the PKK presence in Northern Iraq.  The delegation will 
hold talks with Iraqi PM Maliki and FM Zebari.  Mainstream Hurriyet 
and Milliyet added that during the visit, Iraq will be asked to 
fulfill the requirements of the April 10 diplomatic note that Turkey 
had presented to Baghdad. 
 
Erdogan on Elections, Constitutional Reform 
All papers report that speaking at Turkish Industrialists' and 
Businessmen's Association (TUSIAD) meeting, Prime Minister Erdogan 
criticized the Constitutional Court ruling about the quorum number 
for Presidential election, resulting in the failure to elect a 
president, and said history would judge those who made the decision. 
 The PM also criticized President Sezer, saying the President has 
been intentionally holding on to the law to amend the constitution 
to allow the election of President in a popular vote.  In an 
interview with ATV yesterday, the PM stressed that Abdullah Gul will 
be nominated as the AKP candidate for the Presidency if 
constitutional reforms for the election enter into effect.  The PM 
added that he would not forget the unfair maneuvers during the 
presidential elections which forced Gul to withdraw his candidacy.
