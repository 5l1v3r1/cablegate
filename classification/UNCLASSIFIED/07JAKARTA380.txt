SUBJECT: DEMARCHE REGARDING MINUSTAH RENEWAL DELIVERED 
 
REF: SECSTATE 16568 
 
Â¶1. We delivered reftel demarche to Ramadansyah Hasan in the 
Directorate for International Security and Disarmament at the 
Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs.  We did so in the 
absence of our usual contact for UN Haiti issues. 
Ramadansyah, whom we were meeting concerning UN Iran issues, 
sought to be helpful in conveying the request to the Task 
Force that DEPLU has created to handle UN Security Council 
issues during Indonesia's tenure on that body.  We will 
follow up with the appropriate official on this issue once he 
becomes available.
