SUBJECT: ANNUAL OSAC CRIME AND SAFETY REPORT - - FOR EMBASSY 
BRASILIA AND CONSULATE RECIFE 
 
REF: 08 STATE 132056 
 
 
¶1. (U) THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES TO THE ANNUAL OSAC CRIME/SAFETY 
REPORT ARE KEYED TO REFTEL: 
 
¶I. OVERALL CRIME AND SAFETY SITUATION: A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE 
CRIME AND SAFETY THREATS FACING AMERICANS IN COUNTRY. 
 
¶A. CRIME THREATS; VEHICLE THEFTS, PERSONAL ROBBERIES AND RESIDENTIAL 
THEFTS. 
 
CRIME CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR ISSUE IN BRAZIL -- ESPECIALLY IN THE 
LARGER CITIES. THE BRAZILIAN POLICE AND THE BRAZILIAN PRESS REPORTS 
THAT CRIME CONTINUES TO INCREASE. VIOLENT CRIMES SUCH AS MURDER, 
KIDNAPPING, CARJACKING, ARMED ASSAULT AND BURGLARY REMAIN THE NORM. 
THE CONSOLIDATION OF POWER AMONG A FEW LARGE CRIMINAL GANGS HAS LED 
TO A DECREASE IN GANG-ON-GANG VIOLENCE IN AREAS WHERE THIS 
CONSOLIDATION HAS OCCURRED, BUT THIS HAS ALLOWED THESE GANGS TO 
CONTINUE TO FOCUS MORE ON EXTERNAL (I.E. 'CIVILIAN') TARGETS. 
 
RESIDENTIAL BURGLARIES CONTINUE TO OCCUR REGULARLY. POLICE SOURCES 
ATTRIBUTED A PORTION OF THIS ACTIVITY TO MOBILE STREET GANGS, 
ORIGINATING FROM LARGER AND DISTANT CITIES, SUCH AS SAO PAULO AND 
RIO, WHO TARGET SOME OF THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS SURROUNDING SECTIONS 
OF BRASILIA. OTHER SUSPECTS ARE PERSONS FROM THE SURROUNDING 
SATELLITE CITIES WHO TRAVEL BY BUS OR CAR INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS 
LOOKING FOR TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY. 
 
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, HOTEL SECTORS AND TOURIST AREAS ARE STILL THE 
LOCATIONS WITH THE HIGHEST CRIME RATES, THOUGH THE RSO OFFICE 
CONTINUES TO RECEIVE INCIDENT REPORTS FROM ALL AREAS AND AT ALL 
TIMES. MANY CRIMINALS USE WEAPONS IN THE COURSE OF CARRYING OUT 
THEIR CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES AND A LEVEL OF GRATUITOUS VIOLENCE 
CONTINUES TO EXIST. THE RSO OFFICE RECOMMENDS THAT RESIDENCES BE 
PROPERLY SECURED, INCLUDING SOLID ENTRY DOORS THAT ARE BOLTED, 
GRILLS ON WINDOWS, ADEQUATE LIGHTING AND WORKING ALARM SYSTEMS. 
 
AS A GENERAL RULE, MOST RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES - ESPECIALLY SINGLE 
FAMILY HOMES - ARE OUTFITTED WITH RESIDENTIAL SECURITY SYSTEMS. 
THESE SYSTEMS ARE MONITORED BY LOCAL SECURITY COMPANIES, WHO, IN 
TURN, SUMMON THE LOCAL POLICE UPON RECEIPT OF AN ALARM OR REPORTED 
PROBLEM. SOME NEIGHBORHOODS EMPLOY STATIC GUARD POSTS TO MONITOR 
ACTIVITY ON THE STREETS ADJACENT TO THEIR HOMES. LARGER PROPERTIES 
AND COMMERCIAL SITES GENERALLY EMPLOY 24/7 SECURITY AND GUARD 
SERVICES. THESE MEASURES ARE SEEN AS A RESPONSE TO THE FREQUENCY 
WITH WHICH ROBBERIES AND BURGLARIES HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST AND 
ALSO DUE TO THE FEAR THAT A PORTION OF THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT IS 
OPERATING WITH INCREASING LEVELS OF IMPUNITY. 
 
STREET CRIME REMAINS A PROBLEM FOR VISITORS AND LOCAL RESIDENTS 
ALIKE, ESPECIALLY IN THE EVENINGS AND LATE AT NIGHT. CAUTION IS 
ADVISED WITH REGARD TO NIGHTTIME TRAVEL THROUGH MORE RURAL AREAS AND 
SATELLITE CITIES DUE TO REPORTED INCIDENTS OF ROADSIDE ROBBERIES 
THAT RANDOMLY TARGET PASSING VEHICLES. EVERYONE IS CAUTIONED ABOUT 
INCIDENTS OF ROBBERY AND QUICKNAPPING OUTSIDE OF BANKS AND ATM 
MACHINES. WEALTHIER AND HIGH PROFILE INDIVIDUALS EXPRESS CONCERNS 
REGARDING KIDNAPPINGS FOR RANSOM. LOCAL ATTENTION CONTINUES TO FOCUS 
ON THE POSSIBLE CORRELATION BETWEEN HIGHER RATES OF CRIMINALITY IN 
AREAS ADJACENT TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS ACCESS POINTS AND 
HUBS, SUCH AS BUS STATIONS. 
 
THE FOREIGN VISITOR MAY ALSO BE THE VICTIM OF CERTAIN TYPES OF 
OPPORTUNISTIC CRIMES, IN PART BECAUSE OF THE NOTION THAT THE VISITOR 
WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO FILE A POLICE REPORT AND/OR RETURN TO TESTIFY 
AT CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OF THE PERPETRATORS 
ARE APPREHENDED BY POLICE. 
 
¶B. SAFETY; ROAD CONDITIONS AND ROAD HAZARDS. 
 
THE ROAD SYSTEMS IN BRASILIA AND RECIFE ARE FAIRLY GOOD. THERE IS 
ADEQUATE LIGHTING, TRAFFIC SIGNALS AND MARKED LANES. BRAZIL USES 
PHOTO TICKETING TO MONITOR SPEEDING AND TICKETS WILL BE MAILED TO 
THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE. ROAD CONDITIONS OUTSIDE OF THE MAIN CITIES 
IS HIT AND MISS -- WITH POOR ROADS LINKED TO GOOD ROADS, SPOTTY 
LIGHTING AND FEW PLACES TO SAFELY STOP. 
 
II. POLITICAL VIOLENCE: THE THREAT (IF ANY) FACING AMERICANS FROM 
TERRORISM, WAR OR CIVIL UNREST. THE GENERAL FREQUENCY AND LOCATION 
OF PUBLIC PROTESTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS. 
 
¶A. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. 
 
POLITICAL VIOLENCE IN THE FORM OF PROTESTS OCCURS THROUGHOUT BRAZIL 
-- ESPECIALLY IN THE CAPITAL AND MAJOR CITIES. THESE PROTESTS ARE 
HELD FOR MYRIAD CAUSES AND/OR REASONS -- FROM WORK CONDITIONS TO 
WAGES TO THE ENVIRONMENT.  WHILE THESE PROTESTS ARE GENERALLY 
NON-VIOLENT, THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES OF PROPERTY DAMAGE. THE 
NUMBER AND INTENSITY OF PROTESTS TEND TO INCREASE IF THERE ARE HIGH 
PROFILE FOREIGN VISITORS IN THE COUNTRY. 
 
¶B. REGIONAL TERRORISM AND ORGANIZED CRIME. 
 
THERE ARE, AT THIS TIME, NO KNOWN INDIGENOUS TERRORIST GROUPS 
OPERATING IN BRAZIL. BRAZIL IS A NON-ALIGNED COUNTRY WITH NO 
SIGNIFICANT ENEMIES AND IS NOT TARGETED BY ANY KNOWN RADICAL GROUPS. 
WHILE THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT THREAT FROM ORGANIZED CRIME IN 
BRASILIA AND RECIFE, OTHER CITIES, ESPECIALLY RIO DE JANEIRO AND SAO 
PAULO, HAVE MAJOR DRUG GANGS MAINLY OPERATING IN THE FAVELAS. IN 
2006, THESE GANGS LAUNCHED TWO DEDICATED WAVES OF VIOLENCE, CENTERED 
IN SAO PAULO, THAT WERE LIKENED BY MANY TO A TERRORIST EVENT; THE 
PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL HAS CALLED THESE GANGS TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
¶C. INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
THE TRI-BORDER AREA, COMPRISED OF THE BORDER REGION WHERE BRAZIL, 
ARGENTINA AND PARAGUAY COME TOGETHER, IS HOME TO A LARGE ARAB 
COMMUNITY. TO DATE, NO INCIDENTS DIRECTED AGAINST OFFICIAL OR 
NON-OFFICIAL AMERICANS HAVE OCCURRED IN THIS AREA. WHILE THE EMBASSY 
DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY DISCOURAGE TRAVEL TO THE AREA, SOME 
ANTI-AMERICAN SENTIMENT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IN THE REGION. 
ACCORDINGLY, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT AMERICAN VISITORS TO THE AREA, 
TO INCLUDE FOZ DE IGUAZU, REMAIN ESPECIALLY VIGILANT AND MAINTAIN A 
LOW PROFILE. 
 
¶D. CIVIL UNREST. 
 
THE THREAT OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE IS AN EVER-PRESENT POSSIBILITY 
THROUGHOUT THE MAJOR CITIES OF BRAZIL. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL 
PROTESTS IN THE PAST YEAR IN BRASILIA, RECIFE, RIO DE JANEIRO AND 
SAO PAULO. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF THESE PROTESTS ARE PEACEFUL, 
VIOLENCE OCCASIONALLY OCCURS. ALL VISITORS SHOULD REFRAIN FROM GOING 
OUT WHEN THERE ARE LARGE CROWDS OR ON-GOING PROTESTS. 
 
FOR FURTHER UPDATED INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT THE CONSULAR SECTION 
OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN BRASILIA, THE CONSULAR SECTION OF THE 
AMERICAN CONSULATE IN RECIFE, OR CONSULT THE WEB SITES OF THE 
CONSULAR BUREAU OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE (WWW.TRAVEL.STATE.GOV) OR 
OF THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY IN BRASILIA 
(WWW.EMBAIXADAAMERICANA.ORG.BR). THE EMBASSY PHONE NUMBER IS 
(011-55) 61-3312-7000; THE CONSULATE RECIFE PHONE NUMBER IS (011-55) 
81-3416-3050. 
 
III. POST SPECIFIC CONCERNS: 
 
¶A. EARTHQUAKES AND FLOODS. 
 
PLEASE NOTE THAT NATURAL DISASTERS ARE NOT A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR 
BRAZIL, THOUGH SIGNIFICANT FLOODING DOES OCCUR DURING THE RAINY 
SEASON. 
 
¶B. INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION ACCIDENTS. 
 
REPORTS OF CARGO THEFT, FROM BOTH OVERLAND SHIPMENTS AND FROM 
STORAGE FACILITIES, OCCUR FREQUENTLY.  AIRPORTS COUNTRYWIDE 
INAUGURATED SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY MEASURES, IN PART AS A RESPONSE TO 
REPORTS OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH AVIATION FACILITIES. 
ROAD CONDITIONS CAN BE HIT OR MISS OUTSIDE OF THE MAJOR CITIES AND 
ACCIDENTS DO OCCUR. 
 
¶C. KIDNAPPINGS. 
 
QUICKNAPPINGS CONTINUE TO BE THE PRIMARY TYPE OF KIDNAPPING. THE 
CRIMINALS WILL ABDUCT SOMEONE FOR A SHORT TIME, USUALLY A BRAZILIAN 
CITIZEN, IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A QUICK PAYOFF FROM THE FAMILY, 
BUSINESS OR THE VICTIM'S ATM CARD. HOWEVER, AS STATED ABOVE, ALL 
FOREIGNERS, INCLUDING AMERICANS, ARE VULNERABLE TO THIS CRIME. 
ROBBERY, ASSAULT, BURGLARY AND THEFT CONTINUE TO BE PROBLEMS FOR 
FOREIGNERS AND BRAZILIANS ALIKE IN BRASILIA AND RECIFE. THE 
DETERMINATION AND SOPHISTICATION OF THESE CRIMINALS ILLUSTRATE THE 
VULNERABILITY THAT WE ALL FACE. THE BEST ADVICE TO FOLLOW - VARY 
YOUR ROUTES AND TIMES, ENSURE THAT YOUR RESIDENCE IS SUFFICIENTLY 
PROTECTED (DOORS SHOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL AND EQUIPPED WITH DEADBOLTS 
AND A PEEPHOLE, ALL OPENINGS SHOULD BE GRILLED AND THE GROUNDS 
AROUND YOUR RESIDENCE SHOULD BE ILLUMINATED) AND MAKE YOURSELF A 
"HARD TARGET." INSTRUCT YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND HOUSEHOLD HELP TO BE 
SUSPICIOUS OF INDIVIDUALS ATTEMPTING TO ENTER YOUR RESIDENCE. YOUR 
BEST PROTECTION IS TO BE SECURITY CONSCIOUS. 
 
¶D. DRUGS AND NARCOTERRORISM. 
 
THE MAJOR CITIES OF BRAZIL, LIKE MANY CITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, 
EXPERIENCE THE EFFECTS OF PERSONS ADDICTED TO ILLICIT DRUGS. THIS 
INCLUDES CRIMINAL ACTIVITY - SUCH AS STREET ASSAULTS AND ROBBERIES - 
WHICH ARE USED IN SUPPORT OF THEIR ADDICTIONS. LARGE NUMBERS OF 
IMPOVERISHED PEOPLE LIVE ON THE EDGES OF MOST MAJOR CITIES. 
OFFICIALS EXPRESS FRUSTRATION WITH THE DIFFICULTY IN ADDRESSING THE 
SOCIAL PROBLEMS INCLUDING THE INABILITY TO POLICE THESE 
POPULATIONS. 
 
IV. POLICE RESPONSE: A GENERAL EVALUATION OF POLICE SUPPORT FOR 
FOREIGNERS WHO ARE CRIME VICTIMS. 
 
¶A. HOW TO HANDLE INCIDENTS OF POLICE DETENTION OR HARASSMENT. 
 
PLEASE NOTE THAT POLICE OFFICIALS FREQUENTLY CITE THE PROBLEMATIC 
AND ONGOING LACK OF RESOURCES, SIGNIFICANT STAFFING SHORTAGES AND 
UNMET EXPECTATIONS FOR SALARY INCREASES AND BASIC EQUIPMENT AS 
REASONS FOR WIDELY VARYING RESPONSE TIMES AND THE HIGH RATE AT WHICH 
SERIOUS CRIMES ARE NOT SOLVED. 
 
VISITORS ARE ASKED TO INFORM THE NEAREST EMBASSY OR CONSULATE IN THE 
EVENT THEY ENCOUNTER ANY PROBLEMS WHILE TRAVELING IN BRAZIL -- 
INCLUDING DETAINMENT OR ARREST BY THE POLICE.

VI. TIPS ON HOW TO AVOID BECOMING A VICTIM. HOW TO AVOID SOME OF THE 
CRIMES COMMONLY FACES BY AMERICANS. 
 
 
¶A. CRIMES/SCAMS THAT ARE UNIQUE OR ESPECIALLY FREQUENT. 
 
CRIME CONTINUES TO BE THE PRINCIPAL AND REAL THREAT TO VISITORS TO 
BRAZIL. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF SCAMS USED BY THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT TO 
SEPARATE THE VICTIM FROM THEIR VALUABLES. SOME OF THESE INCLUDE: 
 
SOMEONE CALLS TO SAY THAT SOMEONE YOU KNOW HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED AND 
THAT UNLESS YOU IMMEDIATELY PAY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY -- THE 
PERSON WILL BE HARMED. YOU PAY -- AND THEN FIND OUT THAT THE 
KIDNAPPING NEVER OCCURRED. 
 
YOU RECEIVE A PHONE CALL STATING THAT SOMEONE ON YOUR STAFF OR A 
FAMILY MEMBER HAS BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT AND NEEDS IMMEDIATE MEDICAL 
ATTENTION. YOU ARE ASKED TO PAY FOR THE TREATMENT -- ALWAYS VERIFY. 
 
DO NOT ACCEPT DRINKS FROM STRANGERS AND ALWAYS WATCH YOUR DRINK. 
SCOPOLAMINE, OR A SIMILAR DRUG, MAY BE ADDED TO YOUR DRINK. PEOPLE 
HAVE WOKEN UP ROBBED OF THEIR VALUABLES AFTER ACCEPTING SUCH A 
DRINK. 
 
BE CAREFUL OF CASH TRANSACTIONS ON THE STREET. A HURRIED TRANSACTION 
FOR MERCHANDISE OFTEN LEAVES THE CUSTOMER WITH SHODDY/COUNTERFEIT 
GOODS OR WITH COUNTERFEIT MONEY. 
 
¶B. AREAS OF TOWN TO BE AVOIDED AND BEST SECURITY PRACTICES. 
 
BRASILIA: 
 
THE AREAS IN AND AROUND THE HOTEL SECTOR CAN BE DANGEROUS, 
ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT. ALSO BE WARY OF OPEN MARKETS. TAXIS AND PRIVATE 
VEHICLES SHOULD BE USED WHEN MOVING ABOUT. 
 
RECIFE: 
 
ALL AREAS OF RECIFE CAN BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS, ESPECIALLY AT 
NIGHT. VISTORS SHOULD TRY AND LIMIT THEMSELVES TO THE AREAS BOA 
VIAGEM, GRACAS AND CASA FORTE. 
 
THE RSO OFFICE PROVIDES SECURITY AND TRAVEL-PLANNING INFORMATION FOR 
THOSE PLANNING TRAVEL TO BRAZIL. THE RSO OFFICE OFFERS THE FOLLOWING 
BASIC SECURITY GUIDELINES TO HELP ENSURE YOUR SAFETY AND SECURITY 
WHILE VISITING 
BRAZIL: 
 
VISITORS SHOULD PRACTICE COMMON SENSE PREVENTIVE SECURITY 
TECHNIQUES, JUST AS THEY WOULD IN ANY LARGE CITY IN THE WORLD. BELOW 
ARE SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT TIPS VISITORS SHOULD FOLLOW TO AVOID 
BECOMING A CRIME VICTIM: 
 
TRAVELING IN GROUPS OF TWO OR MORE PERSONS APPEARS TO HAVE A 
POSITIVE EFFECT ON DETERRING THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT. 
 
DO NOT CARRY OR WEAR VALUABLE ITEMS THAT WILL ATTRACT THE ATTENTION 
OF THIEVES. IF YOU NEED TO WEAR EXPENSIVE JEWELRY OR CARRY A CAMERA, 
CONCEAL IT UNTIL YOU ARRIVE AT YOUR DESTINATION. 
 
BE AWARE OF THE STREET ENVIRONMENT AND AVOID CONTACT WITH THOSE WHO 
MAY BE LOOKING FOR CRIME TARGETS. SEEK A SAFER LOCATION. GO INTO A 
STORE, BANK OR SIMPLY CROSS THE STREET. 
 
DO NOT PHYSICALLY RESIST ANY ROBBERY ATTEMPT. WHILE THIS IS A 
PERSONAL DECISION, STATISTICS SHOW THAT RESISTANCE CAN LEAD TO 
INJURY. 
 
BE CAREFUL AT OPEN MARKETS OR CROWDED AREAS. 
 
DO NOT ANSWER YOUR HOTEL ROOM UNTIL YOU POSITIVELY CONFIRM WHO IS ON 
THE OTHER SIDE. LOOK OUT THE PEEPHOLE, OR CALL THE FRONT DESK TO 
CONFIRM THE VISITOR. 
 
DO NOT WALK ON THE BEACHES OR IN PARKS AFTER DARK. ASSAULTS ARE 
COMMON IN THESE AREAS. 
 
AVOID CITY BUSES AND OTHER PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. MANY PASS THROUGH 
HIGH CRIME AREAS AND ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ROBBERIES. ONLY USE 
LEGITIMATE TAXIS. 
 
MANY RESIDENTS AND VISITORS FIND THAT RENTING OR 
PURCHASING A CELLULAR PHONE VERY USEFUL. CELLULAR PHONES ARE WIDELY 
AVAILABLE, INEXPENSIVE AND GENERALLY HIGHLY RELIABLE - ESPECIALLY IN 
THE MAJOR CITIES.
