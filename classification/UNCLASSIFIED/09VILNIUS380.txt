REF: STATE 71036 
 
We delivered reftel points to Agne Pipiraite in the MFA's 
Central Asia and South Caucasus Division and Ieva 
Karpaviciute in the Strategic and Transatlantic Relations 
Division.  They asked whether the increase in assistance to 
Kyrgyzstan was an explicit condition of the agreement on 
Manas, and whether other coalition partners would be able to 
use Manas on the basis of the new agreement, but otherwise 
offered no comment.
