SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT: 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  Iran 
 
 
¶2.  Mideast 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Israel Radio reported that three IDF soldiers were killed in a Hamas 
ambush in Gaza and four others were injured.  The radio quoted 
Palestinian sources as saying that four Hamas activists were 
killed. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that Israel will renew the supply of 
industrial diesel fuel to Gaza's sole power plant, but will not 
resume gasoline transfers.  Defense officials claim that Hamas has 
been hoarding gas for its own uses instead of distributing it to the 
public.  The officials also added that despite the shortages, the 
fuel tanks into which Israeli transfers gas are full, so even if 
Israel would want to resume the supply, it would not be able to. 
 
All media reported that yesterday the Arrow anti-missile missile 
system successfully simulated the interception of a rocket designed 
to mimic the Iranian Shihab missile. In the test, the Green Pine 
Radar -- an integral part of the Arrow system -- tracked a new 
missile made by Rafael called the Blue Sparrow which splits into 
multiple warheads making it difficult to intercept.  Israel is 
planning another test in about six months in which an actual Arrow 
missile will be launched to intercept the Blue Sparrow.  Major media 
quote defense officials as saying yesterday that the U.S. has agreed 
to let Israel connect to its worldwide radar system that can provide 
an early warning of any ballistic missile launched at Israel from 
around the world. 
 
Leading media reported that threats of a possible terrorist attack 
during the Passover holiday are growing in the Sinai, where Egyptian 
forces are hunting terror cells.  The Jerusalem Post quoted senior 
Israeli officials as saying that the defense establishment's 
preparation for a possible Hizbullah attack in response to the 
February assassination of senior Hizbullah leader Imad Mughniyah 
would be at its highest over the holiday. 
 
Makor Rishon-Hatzofe cited the defense establishment's discontent 
with FM Tzipi Livni, who discussed Gilad Shalit's release during her 
visit to Qatar.  The daily reported that the defense establishment 
wants the issue exclusively dealt with by PM Ehud Olmert's special 
envoy Ofer Dekel. 
 
Israel Radio cited the Egyptian daily Al-Ahram as sayng that over 
the past few days there has been a flurry of activity by Egypt to 
mediate a truce between Israel and Hamas.  Maariv reported that the 
defense establishment is increasingly discussing the possibility 
that a Hamas politician could be elected PA president. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that yesterday PA officials urged 
visiting former U.S. President Jimmy Carter not to meet with Hamas 
leader Khaled Mashal later this week. 
 
Maariv quoted a defense source as saying that the government will 
remove Migron and other settler outposts. 
 
Yediot reported on a two-week-long visit to Iran by its envoy Eldad 
Back. 
 
Ha'aretz and The Jerusalem Post reported on the establishment of a 
new Jewish-American lobby that could provide an alternative to 
AIPAC.  Ha'aretz said the group will push a "clearly dovish 
agenda." 
 
Maariv and Israel Radio reported that Palestinian Authority Chairman 
Mahmoud Abbas has awarded the "Jerusalem Medal," the PA's highest 
decoration to two female terrorists detained in Israel -- Ahlam 
Tamimi, who led a suicide bomber to Jerusalem's Sbarro pizzeria in 
August 2001, and Amna Muna, who caused the death of a young Israeli 
after meeting him on the internet.  The radio reported that the 
award will be presented in Abbas's name on Thursday. 
 
Maariv reported that Hizbullah recently set up special units for 
Christian, Druze, and Sunnis.  The newspaper reported that former 
South Lebanon Army fighters, who were allies of Israel, will be 
incorporated into Hizbullah's forces.  Maariv said that in this way 
the Shi'ite group intends to quietly take over Lebanon. 
 
Maariv quoted Likud Chairman MK Benjamin Netanyahu as saying 
yesterday at Bar-Ilan University that the 9/11 attacks changed U.S. 
public opinion in Israel's favor. 
 
 
Saying that the "world food price crisis is moving toward Israel," 
Ha'aretz reported on a 9% annual rise in food prices in the country. 
 Ha'aretz quoted Prof. Uri Shani, the Director of Israel's Water 
Authority, as saying that water desalination is the answer to 
Israel's new water crisis. 
 
Maariv reported that yesterday President Bush signed a declaration 
in honor of "Education and Cooperation Day" in the presence of 
Rabbis of the Hassidic movement Chabad. 
 
The Jerusalem Post presented the results of Tel Aviv University's 
Peace Index poll conducted on March 31 and April 1: Fifty-five 
percent of Israeli Jews regard the West Bank as "liberated land 
while only 32% see it as "occupied."

Summary:

The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: "Bush may not 
be the world's police officer, but in the absence of any other cop 
on the horizon, he can be expected to make good on his promise to 
prevent Iran from acquiring the ability to destroy Israel."

"Iran Is Playing with Fire" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (4/16): "Tehran 
is now waiting for the U.S. presidential and congressional 
elections.  The obvious conclusion is that the threat of an American 
military operation, which in previous years seemed quite close -- 
and the fear of which led to the presumed suspension of the warhead 
program -- has nearly disappeared.  If that is the Iranian 
presumption, it entails a risky gamble.... Killing Americans in 
Iraq, damaging the ability of the government in Baghdad to impose 
security and to enable an American withdrawal, the threat to the 
Iraqi economy, interference in Lebanon through the military 
connection with Hizbullah, encouraging Palestinian terror, and last 
but definitely not least, the nuclear challenge to Israel and the 
assumption that Israel is liable to execute a preemptive strike 
against Iran and thereby drag the region into a new war --- all of 
these are a reason for America to act.  U.S. ground forces are 
already stretched to their limits, but its air forces and its 
missiles would suffice for an operation against Iran. Iran is 
playing with fire that could burn the Middle East.  Bush may not be 
the world's police officer, but in the absence of any other cop on 
the horizon, he can be expected to make good on his promise to 
prevent Iran from acquiring the ability to destroy Israel."

¶2.  Mideast: 
------------ 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Herb Keinon wrote in the conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post: "The worry is that after [Jimmy] Carter 
meets [Khaled] Mashal, others who would like to meet him will ask, 
'If Carter can, why can't we?'" 
 
Giora Eiland, the former head of Israel's National Security Council, 
wrote in the mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot: "[Given 
the unlikely success of the Palestinian track, we must] try to think 
of other solutions.  One of these is a return to the Jordanian 
option." 
 
Arab affairs correspondent Jacky Hoogie wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv: "[There] is a rare convergence of interests 
between Damascus and Jerusalem.  Each of them is keeping silent, so 
as not to force Assad to be shamed publicly and forced into an act 
of revenge." 
 
Arab affairs correspondent Jacky Hoogie wrote in Maariv: "The day 
[may] not [be] far when Hizbullah will turn into a multi-ethnic 
organization under Shi'ite control, and will effectively realize its 
plan of conquering the hearts of the Lebanese people by peaceful 
means.... This vision is not immediate, and it may take time before 
it materializes, but it is not imaginary." 
 
Matti Golan, former editor-in chief of Ha'aretz and business daily 
Globes, maintained in Globes: "[Israeli Arab politicians are 
hinting]: 'Israeli citizenship and membership in the Knesset are our 
most efficient weapon against the Jewish State of Israel -- they are 
our Qassam rockets.'"

¶I.  "Why Israel Snubbed Carter" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Herb Keinon wrote in the conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post (4/16): "The [Israeli] government is 
concerned that [Jimmy] Carter, by meeting the Hamas leader in 
Damascus, will send a trend.  Israel has been pleasantly surprised 
that the boycott of Hamas and its leaders by the U.S. and EU -- has 
held.  The worry is that after Carter meets [Khaled] Mashal, others 
who would like to meet him will ask, 'If Carter can, why can't 
we?'" 
 
II.  "Back to the Jordanian Option" 
 
Giora Eiland, the former head of Israel's National Security Council, 
wrote in the mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (4/16): 
"[Given the unlikely success of the Palestinian track, we must] try 
to think of other solutions.  One of these is a return to the 
Jordanian option.  The Jordanians would not admit it publicly, but a 
Palestinian state in the West Bank is the worst solution for them. 
They too know that within a short time, this state would be ruled by 
Hamas.  As soon as Jordan -- in which there is a Palestinian 
majority and a strong Muslim Brotherhood opposition -- has a common 
border with the Hamas state, the Hashemite regime will be at 
immediate risk.  Other options are regional solutions, in which both 
Egypt and Jordan would contribute to the Palestinian state in the 
territorial realm.  Contrary to conventional wisdom, according to 
which there is no chance of this, it can be demonstrated that the 
great beneficiaries of such an arrangement could actually be Egypt 
and Jordan.  What is clear is that continuing to conduct 
negotiations that cannot lead to any positive outcome is a waste of 
time in the best case, and could lead to a third Intifada in the 
worst case." 
 
III.  "Conspiracy of Silence" 
 
Arab affairs correspondent Jacky Hoogie wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv (4/16): "Two whole months have passed since unknown 
figures assassinated Imad Mughniyah, commander of Hizbullah's jihad 
wing, on Syrian soil.  Everyone is waiting for a Syrian response, or 
at least the results of the investigation.  But Damascus remains 
silent.... One could expect a country whose sovereignty was crudely 
violated to respond in some way.  This is true for any country, and 
particularly for the proud Syrian regime, which [also suffered] the 
mysterious strike by IAF jets on September 6.  In both cases, the 
Syrians preferred to keep a low profile, to restrain their response 
and direct feeble accusations at Israel.  The reason is Bashar 
Assad's dilemma.  If he accuses someone, he will have to react.  And 
if he reacts, he could suffer another blow, particularly if Israel 
is the party in question.... Official Jerusalem kept quiet in both 
cases, despite the fact that the Americans blabbed, for their own 
reasons, after the strike in September.... The Americans have their 
own interest [because of] the suspicion that North Korea was 
involved.... In its care to maintain silence, Israel is assisting 
Assad to enable Arab public opinion to forget both affairs.  The 
result is a rare convergence of interests between Damascus and 
Jerusalem.  Each of them is keeping silent, so as not to force Assad 
to be shamed publicly and forced into an act of revenge.  In the 
meantime, we can certainly send him a bouquet of flowers." 
 
IV.  "Hizbullah's Vision" 
 
Arab affairs correspondent Jacky Hoogie wrote in Maariv (4/16): "If 
this is not information aimed at psychological warfare, and 
Hizbullah has indeed recruited young Sunnis, Christians, and Druze, 
then it is an interesting development.  If it should become stronger 
and branch out into other realms, the day is not far when Hizbullah 
will turn into a multi-ethnic organization under Shi'ite control, 
and will effectively realize its plan of conquering the hearts of 
the Lebanese people by peaceful means.... The gaps dividing 
Hizbullah and large sectors of [Lebanese] society are still very 
great, but it is no secret that many Christians admire Nasrallah for 
his strength and moral character, particularly after surviving the 
war in the summer of 2006.... One imminent test is already just 
around the corner.  It is the Lebanese parliamentary elections, 
which are due to be held in exactly one year.... Hizbullah hopes to 
make use of its improved image in the general public to further its 
standing in the legislature and advance into the government, all in 
a legitimate manner.  From there, Nasrallah and his men will aspire 
to change the constitution and give the Shi'ites a greater slice of 
government to properly express their share of the population.  This 
vision is not immediate, and it may take time before it 
materializes, but it is not imaginary." 
 
¶V.  "Tibi's Qassam Rockets" 
 
Matti Golan, former editor-in chief of Ha'aretz and business daily 
Globes, maintained in Globes (4/16): "My goal, [hints Israeli-Arab 
 
Knesset Member Ahmed] Tibi -- in fact, that of most Israeli Arabs, 
is not the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, 
but a Palestinian state only, without Israel.  Israel doesn't 
necessarily have to be wiped off the map, though this isn't a bad 
option and even a preferable one.  One can simply undermine Israel, 
increase [Arab] birthrate, and take over Israel by democratic means, 
and then turn it into a state that we, the Arabs, are used to: a 
state of all its citizens, ruled by a dictatorship of the Arab 
portion of its citizens.  Thus ... I, Tibi, and my friends, do not 
accept the idea that Arab villages be placed under Palestinian 
sovereignty, because Israeli citizenship and membership in the 
Knesset are our most efficient weapon against the Jewish State of 
Israel -- they are our Qassam rockets."
