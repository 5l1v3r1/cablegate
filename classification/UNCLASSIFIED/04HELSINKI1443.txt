REF: SECSTATE 233267 
 
¶1. On November 2, Acting Econ Chief delivered the reftel 
demarche to officials at the Ministry of Trade and Industry, 
the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) and the 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 
 
¶2. Jussi Manninen, Head of the Nuclear Energy Division at the 
Finnish Ministry of Trade and Industry, expressed his thanks 
for the talking points and explained that security of nuclear 
materials has been an important issue to Finnish regulatory 
authorities since Finland introduced nuclear energy for 
electricity production in the 1960s. Note: Finland has begun 
construction of its fifth nuclear power plant in Olkiluoto, 
which is expected to be completed by 2010. 
 
¶3. Manninen added that the Finnish regulatory regime has a 
well-developed system to account for other high-risk 
radioactive materials as well. He acknowledged Finland's 
readiness to work toward following the guidance contained in 
the IAEA Code of Conduct on Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources. He said he recently reaffirmed this in a 
letter to the Director General of the IAEA.
