SUBJECT: GERMANY'S EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO HAITI FOLLOWING 
EARTHQUAKE 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: Germany's immediate response to the January 
12, 2010 earthquake in Haiti includes the following: 500,000 
euros for food aid, 1 million euros for search and rescue 
operations, a trained search and rescue team, and two water 
purification devices.  More assistance should be forthcoming 
once the UN has made a needs assessment.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) Contacts at the German Ministry of Economic 
Cooperation and Development (BMZ) told us BMZ would provide 
500,000 euros in food aid for Haiti following the earthquake. 
 BMZ will channel this assistance via the German development 
implementing agency GTZ, which is operating out of the 
Dominican Republic. Germany does not want to go through the 
World Food Program (WFP) at this point, having just donated 
2.8 million euros specifically earmarked for similar crises 
to the WFP at the beginning of the year. 
 
¶3. (U) Contacts at the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA) reported that the MFA would provide 1 million euros in 
immediate emergency aid to be used for search and rescue 
operations.  A team from the Technical Assistance Service 
(THW) trained for such operations is currently en route to 
Haiti via Miami.  It is bringing along two machines for water 
purification.  The team will be stationed near the German 
Embassy, and is expected to operate for six weeks. 
 
¶4. (U) BMZ and MFA contacts call these funds a first step, 
with more aid to follow once the UN makes a needs assessment. 
  The German government is also in talks with several NGOs 
(e.g., Welthungerhilfe, German Red Cross) regarding possible 
additional emergency measures. 
 
REGULAR GERMAN DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Germany ended bilateral aid to Haiti following the 
Paris Declaration on Donor Coordination.  The last bilateral 
government negotiations took place in 1995.  German 
development cooperation with Haiti is now channeled via the 
European Union, where Germany contributes 20.5 percent and is 
the largest contributor.  According to German government 
contacts, EU development assistance for Haiti in 2008-2013 is 
232.79 million euros.  Germany still has funds totaling 
nearly 20 million euros from previous years that have not 
been disbursed due to weak government institutions in Haiti. 
The German government has been in the process of negotiating 
use of these funds for work on a hydroelectric power plant. 
The German development bank KfW also runs a financing program 
to combat rural poverty through improved administrative 
structures.  Germany contributes 8 million euros of the 
program's total cost of 9.4 million euros, while the Haitian 
government's share is 1.4 million euros.
