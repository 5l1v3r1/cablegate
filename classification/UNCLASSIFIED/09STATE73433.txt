license.  PM/DTCC also requests that post conduct a site 
visit to Lamar-tex Co., Ltd. in order to provide Department 
with an assessment of its business operations and on-site 
security.  Finally, post is asked to assess whether the 
company appears to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  If 
a site visit is not possible, please inform the PM/DTCC 
officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have supporting documentation for this 
proposed transaction? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items?

--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers
