¶1.  SUMMARY.  Embassy AI team de-briefed GOT MOH 
officials on the conclusions and observations of the 
interagency AI team that visited Turkey January 16-22 
(Ref C).  Given the apparent respite in new human AI 
cases, MOH said it is moving from crisis to risk 
management AI.  World Bank negotiations on an AI package 
have been postponed to March.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
From Crisis to Risk Management 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  Using the cleared USG AI Team paper, Econ Counselor 
and Embassy AI Working Group de-briefed Ministry of 
Health Assistant Director General Ali Coskun and his team 
on February 17.  We stressed Turkey's transparent and 
cooperative response, but noted the need to improve lab 
capacity and communication outreach.  The MOH Reps 
expressed appreciation for the USG AI team's work (Public 
Health Specialist Toker Erguder who accompanied the team 
to Van was present.)  The MOH officials also expressed 
appreciation for the contributions of CDC officials Tim 
Uyeki, who helped check pediatric patients in Van, and 
Stephen Lindstrom, who had participated in the MOH team 
response effort at the Ankara lab. 
 
¶3.  Communicable Disease Expert Mehmet Ali Torunoglu 
stated that Turkey had moved from crisis to risk 
management, noting that there had been no new human cases 
since January 13.  He stated that out of 21 confirmed 
cases (of which, 12 confirmed by the WHO), there had been 
only 4 deaths, suggesting that further analysis was 
needed to explain Turkey's seeming low mortality rate. 
 
¶4.  The MOH officials noted that the World Bank 
coordinated support package would strengthen key 
infrastructure such as lab capacity, as well as improve 
communication capacity and augment stocks of personal 
protective equipment.  They noted that they continued to 
coordinate closely with UNICEF on communication 
strategies.   (Note: an Ankara-based WB official 
confirmed that USAID was working on a potential $1 
million contribution and that that WB negotiations with 
the GOT had been postponed to after March 7.  End Note.)

¶5.  The MOH officials asserted that the parallel Health 
and Agriculture crisis centers (with sharing of 
personnel) were a very effective approach for Turkey, as 
opposed to the creation of a single unit under the Prime 
Minister.  Moreover, they noted that while there was good 
cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture (MARA) on 
crisis response, their long-term objectives for back-yard 
fowl were not the same.  (MOH advocates eradication; MARA 
advocates mitigation and careful reintroduction.) 
 
¶6.  The MOH officials described on-going scientific 
analyses, comprising the range from clinical, 
virological, and epidemiological.  The officials 
described the choice of sending samples to Istanbul or 
Ankara labs as purely geographical.  The MOH provided the 
most current case definition (revised with WHO) to MED 
Officer. 
 
----------------------------------- 
A Few New Cases - Culling Continues 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  GOT MARA confirmed that new animal cases had been 
detected in backyard fowl in three locations in Rize 
Province and two in Elazig Province in the east and 
culling operations had commenced there.  Since the onset 
of new cases in December-January 2006, the GOT reports 
that 2,246,954 birds have been culled among backyard fowl 
mainly in eastern and central Anatolia.
