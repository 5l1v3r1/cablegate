EVENTS PROGRAMMING 
 
 
¶1.   THE STATE-OWNED ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION 
    (ZBC) HAS CONVERTED ONE OF ITS FOUR RADIO STATIONS INTO AN 
    18-HOUR PER DAY SPORTS CHANNEL.  THE NEW CHANNEL, NAMED 
    "SPORTS FM," OCCUPIES THE FREQUENCY FORMERLY USED BY RADIO 
    ¶1.  RADIO 1 WAS AN ENGLISH-LANGUAGE STATION OFFERING MUSIC, 
    NEWS AND CALL-IN DISCUSSION PROGRAMS THAT FOCUSED ON 
    CURRENT AFFAIRS.  THE CONVERSION OF RADIO 1 TO "SPORTS FM" 
    EFFECTIVELY ENDS ALL ADULT-ORIENTED CALL-IN RADIO 
    PROGRAMMING IN ZIMBABWE. 
 
¶2.   RADIO 1 WAS THE LAST VESTIGE OF THE RHODESIAN 
    BROADCASTING SERVICE.  ITS ALL-ENGLISH FORMAT AND MUSIC 
    PLAY LIST CATERED TO ZIMBABWEANS OF EUROPEAN ANCESTRY. 
    CONSEQUENTLY, RADIO 1 HAD THE SMALLEST AUDIENCE AND WAS THE 
    LEAST PROFITABLE OF ANY OF THE ZBC'S FOUR RADIO STATIONS. 
    THE STATION DID, HOWEVER, HAVE A STRONG FOLLOWING AMONG A 
    WIDE VARIETY OF ZIMBABWEANS FOR ITS EVENING CALL-IN CURRENT 
    EVENTS PROGRAMS.  THESE PROGRAMS OFFERED CITIZENS AN 
    OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS AND ASK PANELISTS 
    QUESTIONS ABOUT IMPORTANT ISSUES.  CALLERS FREQUENTLY 
    VOICED SHARP CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNMENT OR RULING PARTY. 
 
¶3.   OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS, THESE PROGRAMS HAVE GRADUALLY 
    BEEN CANCELLED, REDUCED TO PANEL DISCUSSIONS WITHOUT CALLS 
    FROM THE AUDIENCE, OR RE-DIRECTED TO FOCUS ON NON-POLITICAL 
    TOPICS.  ZBC HAS NEVER OFFERED REASONS FOR THESE PROGRAM 
    CHANGES, BUT THE POPULAR PERCEPTION IS THAT ZBC MANAGEMENT 
    AND THEIR POLITICAL BOSSES WERE UNHAPPY ABOUT PROVIDING A 
    FORUM FOR PUBLIC DISCUSSION AND CRITICISM OF THE 
    GOVERNMENT.  ACCORDING TO ONE CONTACT AT ZBC, THE 
    "AUTHORITIES" HAD BECOME "VERY UNCOMFORTABLE" WITH PUBLIC 
    COMPLAINTS ON THE CALL-IN PROGRAMS ABOUT THE "DEEPENING 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  03530  260645Z 
    ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CRISIS UNDER PRESIDENT ROBERT 
    MUGABE."  BY CONVERTING THE STATION TO AN ALL-SPORTS 
    FORMAT, THE ZBC NEATLY USES A DEFENSIBLE BUSINESS DECISION 
    TO GIVE ITSELF A POLITICAL "COMFORT ZONE." 
 
¶4.   IN ADDITION TO REMOVING GENUINE DISCUSSION PROGRAMS 
    FROM ZIMBABWEAN AIRWAVES, THE CONVERSION OF THE STATION TO 
    ALL SPORTS HAS ALSO DEALT A BLOW TO PLACEMENT OF VOA 
    PROGRAMMING.  OF THE FOUR ZBC RADIO STATIONS, RADIO 1 HAS 
    BEEN THE BIGGEST USER OF VOA NEWS, CURRENT AFFAIRS AND 
    MUSIC PROGRAMS.  HOWEVER, VOA PROGRAMMING WILL CONTINUE ON 
    RADIOS 3 AND 4.
