SUBJECT: TRAVEL ALERT - ZIMBABWE 
 
¶1. This Travel Alert updates safety and security concerns 
in Zimbabwe, and urges U.S. citizens to defer all travel to 
Zimbabwe at this time, and to consider relocating if 
necessary to ensure their security during the election 
period.  The U.S. Embassy may periodically restrict the 
travel of U.S. government personnel outside the capital 
city or within Harare during certain hours.   This 
supersedes the Travel Alert for Zimbabwe dated June 2 and 
expires on August 1, 2008. 
¶2. U.S. citizens should defer all travel to Zimbabwe. U.S. 
citizens resident in Zimbabwe should carefully review their 
personal circumstances, avoid all travel after dark, and 
consider moving to a more secure location in advance of, 
and immediately following the scheduled June 27 runoff of 
the presidential election.  Due to the uncertain security 
situation, the U.S. Embassy may periodically restrict the 
travel of official U.S. government personnel outside the 
capital city or within Harare during certain hours.  Since 
the March 29 general election, Zimbabwean security forces, 
including some military and police, as well as so-called 
war veterans, have created a climate of intimidation and 
fear across the country. There have been numerous and 
widespread attacks on opposition supporters, renewed farm 
invasions, and arrests and beatings of election officials 
accused of vote tampering. There is a continued risk of 
arbitrary detention or arrest. 
¶3. Americans should be particularly cautious when using 
still, video or telephone cameras in any urban setting or 
in the vicinity of any political activity, as this could be 
construed by Zimbabwean authorities as misrepresenting 
oneself as an accredited journalist, a crime punishable by 
arrest, incarceration and/or deportation. 
¶4. American citizens traveling to or resident in Zimbabwe 
should register with the U.S. Embassy by completing a 
registration form online at 
https://travelregistration.state.gov.  Registration enables 
the Embassy to contact American citizens in case of 
emergency and provide updates on the security situation. 
Important notices for American citizens are posted on the 
U.S. Embassy in Harare's website at 
(http://harare.usembassy.gov/warden2008.html) 
¶5. As the Department of State continues to develop 
information on any potential security threats to U.S. 
citizens overseas, it shares credible threat information 
through its consular information program documents, 
available on the Internet at http://travel.state.gov. In 
addition to information on the Internet, travelers may 
obtain up-to-date information on security conditions by 
calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the U.S. or outside the 
U.S. and Canada on a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444. 
¶6. Minimize considered.
