¶1. Embassy Manama appreciates this opportunity to comment on 
the Department's efforts to better support non-FCS posts.  We 
believe that non-FCS posts would benefit both from increased 
access to Commerce information and accounting systems and 
additional training opportunities. 
 
¶2.  Embassy Manama offers the following suggestions: 
 
-- Full access to Commerce's e-menu finance system.  Without 
full access Embassy Manama has encountered difficulty when 
charging fees for services provided to U.S. businesses. 
Currently Manama is authorized to charge for services 
according to standard USDOC practice.  Unfortunately, fiscal 
data still must be entered by FCS Dhahran -- adding to 
Dhahran's workload -- while not reducing Manama's.  While FCS 
posts are, and should remain, a ready resource for non-FCS 
posts, the lack of access to those systems has hindered 
Manama's ability to provide services efficiently.  In 
addition, post has encountered difficulties when receiving 
funds obligated in e-menu rather than by cable. 
 
-- Additional training for officers assigned to non-FCS 
posts.  Of particular interest, the "nuts and bolts" of 
required reporting including how to use the Commerce system 
to track services provided. 
 
-- Increase collaboration among regional non-FCS posts.  In 
particular, developing joint projects, working together to 
represent U.S. business at regional industry conferences, 
establishing regional "best practices."
