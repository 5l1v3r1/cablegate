SUBJECT: GUINEA BISSAU: COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUND PROPOSALS 
 
REF: STATE 013790 
 
¶1.  We request USD 41,700 for the FY-2007 Community 
Development Fund (formerly the Ambassador's Special Self-Help 
and Democracy and Human Rights Funds) for Guinea-Bissau. 
Mission priorities follow. 
 
¶2.  Proposed self-help priorities are: 
 
¶A.  Purchase and installation of a mill for grinding millet. 
The project will be carried out by the community of 
Fajonquito, region of Bafata, and benefit primarily women who 
grind millet by hand.  Total cost is USD 5,300. 
 
¶B.  Construction of a school in Nhacra.  Lack of schools in 
the village compel students to leave town for an education, 
and often they do not return.  The biggest impact will be on 
girls who are generally not allowed to leave home for 
studies.  Total cost is USD 10,000. 
 
¶3.  If additional funds will be available to support 
self-help projects in Guinea-Bissau this year, the money can 
be put to very good use.  We propose the following project: 
 
¶A.  Construction of a community carpentry shop.  The project 
is proposed by the Carpentry Cooperative of the village of 
Cuntum Madina.  It would benefit young people skilled in 
carpentry, giving employment and offering opportunities to 
keep people in the community.  Total cost is USD 4,100. 
 
¶4.  Our proposed democracy and human rights proposal is: 
 
Description:  The Human Rights League of Guinea-Bissau is the 
primary non-governmental organization focused on raising 
awareness of and defending human rights.  It has tirelessly 
confronted the Government on issues of press freedoms, female 
genital mutililation, trafficking in children, violence, 
impunity corruption and other abuses.  The League proposes to 
focus a program on the media to provide training and 
workshops to help media improve its role as a promoter of 
dialogue in a democracy.  Specific activities include 
seminars held around the country focused on media's roles and 
responsibilities in a democracy; production of teaching 
materials and packets; creation of a plan of action; 
organization of national debates; and production of radio 
programs. 
 
Specific objectives: Training and awareness raising for media 
professionals; creation of a professional corps to produce 
and disseminate information produced; promote a free and fair 
electoral process for next year's legislative elections; and 
production and distribution of materials promoting core 
objectives. 
 
Cost: USD 22,300 
Location: Nationwide 
Past DHRF Funding: none 
 
Results: Use of media as an instrument for social 
communication of national issues and conflicts; existence of 
a professional corps of media professionals trained on 
democracy promotion; constructive participation of local 
governments; transparent production of information for public 
consumption; production of news intended to educate and 
inform the public.
