SUPPORT FOR AMISOM AND SOMALIA SECURITY SECTOR REFORM 
 
REF: SECSTATE 23811 
 
On March 20, poloff delivered reftel demarche to MFA Somali 
Desk Officer Anna Harrell.  She said Sweden pledged in 2008 
an unearmarked contribution of USD 1.5 million to AMISOM. 
AMISOM has yet to use the funds.  Harrell said the fund 
allocation expires April 1, 2009 and the Africa Union (AU) 
must ask Sweden for an extension to use the funds or a new 
contribution.  She said the AU has many problems and "is 
unable to receive contributions in an affective way." 
Swedish officials are eager to ensure AMISOM is successful 
and when they visit Nairobi they regularly meet with AU 
representatives.
