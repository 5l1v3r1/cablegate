¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: On March 10, the chair of the Iran 
Sanctions Committee updated the UN Security Council on the 
Committee's activities over the last ninety days, including 
its actions to respond to the discovery of arms-related 
materiel being shipped from Iran to Syria in violation of 
UNSCR 1747.  Amb. Rice expressed concern over Iran's 
continued refusal to comply with its international 
obligations regarding proliferation-sensitive nuclear 
activities and she supported the steps the Iran Sanctions 
Committee has taken to respond to the violation of UNSCR 
¶1747.  Rice also noted that while the United States will 
continue to ensure that Iran does not obtain nuclear weapons, 
the United States is also prepared for principled engagement 
with Iran.  The United Kingdom and France each delivered 
strong statements of concern over troubling elements in the 
latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) and the clear violation of UNSCR 1747.  Libya 
expressed a desire to see all Member States comply with 
international nuclear non-proliferation regulations, 
including Israel.  At the end of the meeting, the Iranian UN 
mission distributed a letter asserting that its cooperation 
with the IAEA had exceeded its treaty obligations.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On March 10, Japanese Perm Rep Takasu, chair of the 
Iran Sanctions Committee (1737 Committee), briefed the 
Council on the activities of the committee over the past 
ninety days.  These activities, he reported, included 
clarifying aspects of the sanctions regime to interested 
states, approving its 2008 annual report and receiving a 
notification from Russia concerning the delivery of items for 
use in the Iranian nuclear power plant at Bushehr.  Takasu 
noted also that the Committee received a letter from a Member 
State seeking guidance with respect to a vessel found to be 
carrying arms-related materiel in violation of UNSCR 1747. 
On March 9, he reported, the Committee sent letters to the 
concerned Member States inviting them to provide within ten 
working days any additional information regarding this 
transaction. 
 
¶3.    (SBU) Amb. Rice noted that the IAEA Director General's 
most recent report indicated that Iran is not complying with 
its international obligations, including resolutions of the 
Council, with respect to proliferation-sensitive nuclear 
activities. She expressed hope that the Iran Sanctions 
Committee will take appropriate action under its mandate to 
address the Iranian government's attempt to transport 
arms-related materiel to Syria, (including considering how 
the ship's cargo should be disposed of or destroyed,), and 
requested that the Committee redouble its efforts to ensure 
full and robust implementation of UNSCR 1737, 1747 and 1803. 
Rice said the United States will not waver in its 
determination to ensure that Iran does not obtain nuclear 
weapons, but that the United States also sees a chance for 
the Iranian government to unclench its fist and begin a 
serious, responsible discussion about a range of issues. 
 
¶3.   (SBU) France Perm Rep Ripert also emphasized troubling 
elements of the latest IAEA report, noting that the Iranians 
have refused to give access to their reactor at Arak or 
implement various transparency measures. He also called on 
the Iranian government to re-evaluate its behavior and make 
the necessary gestures to restore international confidence. 
Ripert expressed France's gratitude to Cyprus for taking a 
"responsible course of action" by retaining the cargo of the 
Monchegorsk, and encouraged all Member States to remain 
active and vigilant in responding to future sanctions 
violations. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) UK Perm Rep Sawers also expressed concern over 
Iran's nuclear activities, including its refusal to suspend 
heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. He called on 
Iran to implement the IAEA measures and Additional Protocol, 
advising the international community to make clear to Iran 
that "its choices have a cost." Sawers referred to the 
Monchegorsk incident as a "clear violation" of UNSCR 1747 and 
said the UK looked forward to hearing explanations from Iran 
and Syria. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Libyan charge Dabbashi encouraged Member States to 
engage in dialogue towards a comprehensive long-term solution 
for peace and nuclear non-proliferation in the Middle East, 
including through engaging in direct negotiations with Iran. 
He expressed frustration that the IAEA had not considered 
Israel's refusal to accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty.

¶6.  (SBU) After the meeting, the Iranian UN mission 
circulated a letter (emailed to IO) stating that Iran has 
always been a committed member of the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty and that Iran's cooperation with the IAEA had gone far 
beyond its treaty obligations.  In the letter, Iran denounced 
the "distortions" made against its nuclear program by the 
United States, United Kingdom, and France and expressed the 
opinion that the IAEA reports clearly attest to the 
exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program.
