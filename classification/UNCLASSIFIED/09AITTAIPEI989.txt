SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-CHINA-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
Summary:  On August 14, the Taiwan media spotlight remained focused 
on the damage caused by Typhoon Morakot and the on-going rescue 
efforts in southern Taiwan.  In terms of editorials and 
commentaries, an op-ed in the pro-independence, English-language 
"Taipei Times" expressed concern over the increasingly 
interdependent relations between the United States and China and the 
impact of such a development on Taiwan.  The article said it is 
doubtful that U.S. President Barack Obama, "surrounded by 
China-leaning advisers," will have time to "digest Taiwan's complex 
problems."  As a result, the article urged that Taiwan's views and 
concerns be presented to Obama as quickly as possible.  End 
summary. 
 
"Risks of Obama Giving in to China" 
 
Li Thian-hok, a freelance commentator based in Pennsylvania, opined 
in the pro-independence, English-language "Taipei Times" 
[circulation: 30,000] (8/14): 
 
"... In his June 4 speech in Cairo, Obama eloquently extolled the 
virtues of democracy, then followed with a caveat that 'there is no 
straight line to realize this promise ... Each action gives life to 
this principle (that governments should reflect the will of the 
people) in its own way, grounded in the traditions of its own 
people. America does not presume to know what is best for everyone.' 
 This language sounds like the excuses made by many authoritarian 
regimes (see 'The abandonment of democracy,' by Joshua Muravchik, 
published in the July/August issue of the Commentary).  The 
de-emphasis on promoting democracy, unfortunately, could also mean 
that the Obama administration may not place much value on Taiwan's 
democracy serving as a model for autocratic China. 
 
"Lastly, President Ma Ying-jeou's pro-unification policies give 
pro-China realists among the US policy establishment a convenient 
pretext for dropping support for Taiwanese freedom. There is even 
talk of a G2 cooperation, whereby Washington would cede control and 
management of East Asian affairs to Beijing, thus pushing China 
toward the path of military aggrandizement, unrestrained nationalism 
and, eventually, confrontation with the US.  So what is the danger 
to Taiwan from the upcoming US-China summit? It is the possibility 
that Obama may privately cave in to Hu and shift the US policy goal 
dramatically from 'peaceful resolution' to 'peaceful unification.' 
Alternatively, Obama may even openly endorse a peace accord between 
Taiwan and China, an idea which both Beijing and Ma support. Either 
event would signify the cessation of US support for Taiwan and 
virtual abrogation of the Taiwan Relations Act. ... 
 
"Obama is surrounded by China-leaning advisers and it is doubtful he 
will have time to digest Taiwan's complex problems. His team 
consists mainly of realists who regard democracy and human rights as 
secondary considerations in conducting US diplomacy. So there are 
ample reasons to present the Taiwanese views and concerns to Obama, 
and to do so quickly. ...  As was pointed out in the letter to 
Obama, the US is vulnerable to a seminal geostrategic disaster in 
East Asia. The US' national security and its democratic values both 
call for unwavering support of Taiwan's freedom by reaffirming the 
Taiwan Relations Act, strengthening trade relations and military 
cooperation with Taiwan, and bolstering US naval and air presence in 
the Western Pacific, as mandated in the Act."
