SUBJECT: U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL -- SEEKING SUPPORT ON 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
REF: STATE 19889 
 
¶1.  (U) Poloff reviewed reftel points with Salman Al Farisi, 
Director General in the Directorate of Economic Development 
and Environmental Affairs at the Department of Foreign 
Affairs (DEPLU), on February 29.  Poloff--noting the 
importance of the issue of climate change--urged Indonesia to 
reach out to Maldivian representatives in Geneva to discuss 
concerns regarding the Maldives' proposed resolution on 
climate change and human rights in its current form.  Poloff 
also urged Indonesia to consider the impact that the proposed 
resolution would have on both the Bali Action Plan and the 
already overstretched U.N. Human Rights Council. 
 
¶2.  (U) Al Farisi expressed no immediate reaction to the 
USG's concerns, but said he was aware of the proposed 
resolution.  He said he was expecting a report from his 
colleagues in Geneva regarding the matter.  He said he would 
pass the USG-provided points to Wiwiek (one  name only), the 
Director General for Human Rights at DEPLU.
