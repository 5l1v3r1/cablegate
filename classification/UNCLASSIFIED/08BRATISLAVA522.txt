PolOff delivered reftel points on Saturday, November 8, to 
Albin Otruba, the Slovak MFA's European Correspondent. 
Otruba thanked PolOff for sharing U.S. perspectives and 
agreed in principle.  Otruba noted that he did not believe 
that Russia's security proposals would be on the GAERC 
agenda.  Otruba also said that Slovakia is cautious and does 
not want Russia to feel shut out, as Russia is a large and 
important power, upon which Slovakia is dependent for its 
energy.
