SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  The Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) carried out 
the "First Meeting of National Coordinators for the Project 
'Strengthening of Regional Management for the Sustainable Use of 
Amazonian Biodiversity'" in Brasilia (Brazil) October 25-27, 2006. 
The following spot report details the IDB financed project as well 
as providing general guidance on the project and points of contact 
that may be of interest to ESTH officers in South America.  End

------------------------- 
Understanding the Project 
------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On July 25, 2005, the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization 
(ACTO) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) signed a 
Technical Assistance Agreement to execute the project "Strengthening 
of Regional Management for the Sustainable Use of Amazonian 
Biodiversity."  A total of US$2.4 million will be allocated for the 
project, of which US$1.9 will come from IDB, US$0.3 million from 
ACTO, and US$0.2 million from each Amazon Basin country.  The 
execution period for the project is 3.5 years.  The project aims to 
coordinate and broaden knowledge about regional biodiversity in the 
Amazon and its potential uses, supporting conservation and 
sustainable use with cooperation among the Amazon Basin countries. 
 
¶3.  The project is made up of three components and in general 
consists of the hiring of technical experts to formulate action 
plans in the region: 
 
A) Formulating a strategic framework and regional action plan on 
biodiversity - US$122,000 
 
1) National consultants (8) for "Country Studies on Amazonian 
Biodiversity Management."  Consultations will prepare a Country 
Study on topics related to the Management of Amazon Regional 
Biodiversity in each of the ACTO Member Countries to serve as input 
in executing the Project "Strengthening of Regional Management for 
the Sustainable Use of Amazonian Biodiversity." 
 
2) Expert to formulate the "Regional Amazonian Biodiversity Action 
Plan."  Expert will prepare an Action Plan on Biodiversity in the 
Amazon Cooperation Treaty Region based on strategies recently 
approved in Brazil and the Andean countries (Regional Biodiversity 
Strategy of the Andean Tropic Countries) and on the provisions set 
forth in the Agreement on Biological Diversity. 
 
B) Strengthening the capacity of coordinating applied research and 
generating public information accessible regionally - US$820,000 
 
1) Expert to formulate the "Strategy on Science & Technology for the 
 
BRASILIA 00002448  002 OF 003 
 
 
Amazon region."  This expert will prepare a Strategy on S&T for the 
Amazon region, based on the participation of relevant organizations 
and institutions of ACTO Member countries, in coordination with the 
Amazon Universities Association (UNAMAZ) 
 
2) Expert in Mechanisms for the Sustainable Use of Amazonian 
Biodiversity ("Intellectual Property Rights").  This person will 
establish a consensual proposal of a regional protocol with clear 
mechanisms in regard to intellectual property rights over Amazon 
biodiversity. 
 
C) Strengthening the capacity for coordinating and supporting 
conservation in priority areas - US$928,000 
 
1) CITES Expert in "Monitoring and Control of Amazon Biodiversity 
Trafficking."  Participant will help formulate a strategic 
cooperation system among countries to monitor and control Amazon 
Biodiversity trafficking 
 
2) Expert in on-site biodiversity conservation management (expert in 
"Protected Areas").  Expert will establish a mechanism for political 
coordination and financial management within ACTO's work agenda to 
facilitate and promote the establishment of 'corridors' and 
protected areas in transborder areas in the Amazon 
3) Expert in "Environmental Impact Studies of Regional 
Infrastructure."  This expert will carry out an analysis of the 
risks posed to biodiversity as a result of infrastructure 
construction in the Amazon region.

¶4.  During the First Meeting of National Coordinators, held in 
Brasilia October 25-27, 2006, each Amazon Basin country presented 
preliminary information on their biodiversity management strategies. 
 Presentations covered the following topics: 
-- General description of the country and the Amazon region; 
-- Regulatory framework 
-- Environmental management and biodiversity institutional features 
-- Country's biodiversity conservation strategy 
-- Science and technology for the Amazon 
-- Biodiversity traffic control 
-- Priority actions for Amazon biodiversity conservation in 
protected areas 
-- Infrastructure development in the Amazon Region 
-- Information systems and database on the Amazon 
A formal Country Study with these issues covered in depth will be 
prepared by each country and will be validated during a "national 
event of analysis and discussion with relevant actors of both public 
and private sectors."
