In Today's Papers 
 
National Security Council Discusses Operations into Northern Iraq 
All papers report the Turkish National Security Council (MGK) said 
in a statement after a meeting Thursday the Turkish military would 
continue to carry out cross-border operations against the PKK 
terrorists in northern Iraq "whenever necessary."  "MGK discussed 
the importance of improving cooperation with Iraq in political, 
economic, commercial, energy, cultural, and military fields as well 
as in increasing humanitarian aid for Iraq," the statement said. 
 
Mainstream Hurriyet says the statement could be seen as green light 
for a visit of Iraqi President Talabani to Turkey.  Mainstream Vatan 
says Talabani would be invited for a working visit to avoid military 
welcoming ceremonies. 
 
Papers report that after the MGK meeting, Prime Minister Erdogan and 
Foreign Minister Babacan remained in the presidential palace and 
held a 45-minute meeting with President Gul.  Reports speculate the 
issue discussed at the "mini-summit" was the preparation for new 
operations into northern Iraq. 
 
Turkey Launches Ground Offensive into Northern Iraq 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Taraf, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, and 
others report Turkish artillery shelled PKK positions in northern 
Iraq on Thursday, targeting the PKK camps in Zap, Hakurk, and 
Avashin.  Papers also say the Turkish military build-up on the 
border has intensified to levels not seen before.  Prior to the 
National Security Council (MGK) meeting yesterday, Turkish fighter 
jets conducted reconnaissance flights over northern Iraq.  There 
were reports Thursday evening that M-60 tanks were also sent to the 
border area, and that Turkish artillery shelled the PKK positions in 
northern Iraq. 
 
Papers report Peshmerge forces spokesman Jabbar Yawar denied there 
had been fighting Thursday between Peshmerge and Turkish troops 
inside northern Iraq.  The office of the Chief of Turkish General 
Staff (TGS,) too, denied in a statement posted on its website there 
had been clashes between Turks and Peshmerge forces. 
 
Televisions report Friday morning over 10,000 Turkish troops crossed 
the border into northern Iraq in a ground operation against the PKK. 
 The TGS said in a statement Friday morning it had launched the 
ground offensive, backed by fighter aircraft, to attack the PKK 
terrorists.  Televisions say Turkish troops advanced some 10 km 
inside the Iraqi territories.  Turkish correspondents in northern 
Iraq report the Kurdish regional administration leader Massoud 
Barzani went to the "operations zone" to see the situation. 
 
Industrialists Demand for Urgent Economic Measures 
Radikal, Zaman, Sabah, Hurriyet, Taraf and others:  Turkish 
Industrialists' & Businessmen's Association (TUSIAD), Turkish 
Clothing Industry (TGSD) and Union of Chambers & Commodity Exchanges 
of Turkey (TOBB) drew attention to the unemployment problem and 
asked the government to take necessary measures.  Mainstream Sabah 
summarizes the messages of the industrialists as follows:  TUSIAD: 
"The nearing municipality elections have fueled risks for public 
finance.  The importance of preserving fiscal discipline has 
increased in the current conjuncture."  TOBB: "The markets are in 
difficult situation because of the tough foreign currency and 
interest rate policies.  The industry needs immediate incentives to 
increase the competitive power of industrialists."  TGSD: "Many 
companies might be forced to shut down.  Hundreds of thousands of 
people might loose their jobs." 
 
Turkish Constitution Debate at Columbia University Stirs 
Controversy:  Radikal carried an interview with Dengir Firat, an MP 
from ruling AKP who is invited to attend a debate at Columbia 
University on Turkish constitutional draft.  Firat confirmed his 
attendance and said that "we are going there to discuss our 
 
ANKARA 00000335  002 OF 003 
 
 
constitutional system with American experts; we are not going to 
announce the new constitution there." Regarding the Fethullah Gulen 
group's involvement as a sponsor to the event, Firat said he was not 
aware of this.  Columnist Hakki Devrim of Radikal daily highlighted 
this visit as "Our Constitution Draft is Traveling to New York" and 
questioned the fact that American experts are going to examine new 
Turkish Constitution while Turkish people have absolutely no idea 
what the new draft is all about.  Columnist Ruhat Mengi of Vatan 
daily expressed deep concern over this panel and described the event 
incredible because the draft goes to the US first before it was made 
it to Turkish public and discussed domestically. 
 
Editorial Opinion on Turkey's Land Operation in Iraq: 
 
"Land Operations are on the Table" 
Ferai Tinc wrote in mainstream Hurriyet (2/22):  "What could be the 
main reason for Turkey's sporadic ground operation rhetoric? 
Interestingly enough, Foreign Minister Babacan felt the need to 
repeat this rhetoric on his way to Moscow.  The fact of the matter 
is that any operation will have to be shaped through consensus 
between Turkey, Iraq and the US.  There may be two reasons for 
bringing the ground operation option to the public attention. 
Turkey may decide to enter northern Iraq and take control over a 
certain area, but this does not seem rational.  Also, the ruling AKP 
uses this rhetoric as a political tool for the domestic audience in 
order to gain credit.  Such an effort can be described as a bad 
tactic because it creates vengeance.  The AKP, just like the 
previous administrations, has turned over the PKK fight to the hands 
of military and did not want to be a part of solution process.  It 
is of course a comforting thing for the government to pass the issue 
to military and be immune from taking political responsibility for 
solution." 
 
"Barzani Should not Stand Against Turkey" 
Yasin Dogan wrote in Islamist leaning-pro government Yeni Safak 
(2/22):  "Earlier this week, Barzani made another irresponsible and 
provocative statement.  He talked about the limits of patience and 
warns that they are not going to be silent against Turkish army 
operations.  In fact it is Turkey which feels enough is enough.  A 
cross border operation is being considered because northern Iraq has 
become an active base for PKK attacks against Turkey.  Barzani is 
providing shelter and support to a terrorist organization, thus his 
statements insisting he has nothing to do with PKK is far from 
convincing.  He should stop sponsoring the PKK and take every step 
to get rid of PKK.  Turkey has absolutely no interest in the Iraq 
territory and respects its territorial integrity as long as PKK does 
not operate there."
