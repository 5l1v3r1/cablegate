¶1. (U)  Per reftel, Post delivered demarche and diplomatic 
notes to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the 
request to vote against three, one-sided resolutions on the 
Middle East. Government of Suriname acknowledged receipt of 
information.  GOS informed Post that the Ministry is 
reviewing the resolutions with its mission at UN.  GOS said 
the MFA and their UN Mission talk daily and will share any 
information received in the future.  However, GOS also 
suggested that approaching its UN mission directly would be 
more effective. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  COMMENT: Post takes this vague response to mean 
the GOS does not plan to take a formal position on this issue 
and may leave the decision up to its UN ambassador.  END 
COMMENT 
 
¶3.  (U)  Post will inform the Department of any further 
response from GOS.
