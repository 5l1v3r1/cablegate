SUBJECT: G-20 and Doha- Sao Paulo Media Reaction 
 
Title: In a sober meeting, G-20 prioritize preventive actions 
 
Editorial in economic newspaper Valor Economico (11/18) says: 
"Equally surrounded by skepticism and somewhat reasonable 
expectations, the first meeting of the G-20 leaders...surprised for 
the objectivity and commitments assumed... The G-20 summit might 
have modestly made history by opening up decision mechanisms which 
include the emerging countries and reflect the changes in economic 
power since Breton Woods.  Made without exultation, it is an 
excellent change, which now needs to be put into practice." 
 
Title: The G-20 and the immediate challenge 
 
Lead editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (11/18) 
comments: "The first summit of the Chiefs of State of the G-20, in 
Washington, was more productive than expected, but the major 
challenge at this moment is not the reform of the international 
financial system but to alleviate and shorten the crisis... Several 
good ideas were presented and, before damages caused by the subprime 
bubble, maybe governments could be stimulated to promote important 
changes.  This we will see later.  Also, it is necessary to check if 
the G-20, when the emergency is gone, will be consolidated as a 
forum of major negotiations on the global economy.  For now, 
rhetoric is more promising than the experience." 
 
Title: Back to Doha 
 
Liberal Folha de S. Paulo editorialized (11/18): "The G-20 summit 
brought few surprises - all very light, because it is not expected 
that such an extensive meeting called at the last minute might dry 
out and even less solve the financial international crisis.  Among 
rare unexpected things in Washington was the recommendation of the 
Chiefs of State and governments that the Doha Round negotiations be 
resumed in December.  It is a good sign that such determination had 
survived at the G-20 communiqu... The resumption of Doha 
negotiations in December depends on Pascal Lamy, Director General of 
WTO, to have sufficient political support to call for a meeting 
within a month.  As Obama takes office in January, it is his 
interest to prevent that this happens.  Counterbalancing such 
obstacle is only the size of the crisis.  It is necessary to verify 
if it is serious enough to change the usual rhetoric of the summits 
into real concessions at the negotiation table."
