SUBJECT: REQUEST TO RESETTLE PROTECTED MIGRANTS FROM 
GUANTANAMO -- INTERIM RESPONSE 
 
REF: 06 STATE 181903 
 
Â¶1.  After initial discussions in November and December on 
reftel request, on January 9 Greg Vassiloconstandakis  (MFA 
Deputy Director for North America) updated Polcouns on the 
ministry's internal deliberations.  The response from the 
MFA's legal department was not positive; it emphasized that 
there was no provision in Greek law to allow for the legal 
resettlement of this category of migrants.  However, 
Vassiloconstandakis noted that the matter was still under 
consideration by the MFA's new political director; a more 
comprehensive response would be forthcoming as soon as 
possible.
