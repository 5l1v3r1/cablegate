SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050097822 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Posts' assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050097822 for the export of 
rifles to Canada. Posts are requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 45 days. Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: The license application lists Russian 
company, Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavoid, as a manufacturer of 
Winchester 'Wildcat' Rifles. However, PM/DDTC does not/not 
have a manufacturing license agreement (MLA) on record, as 
required under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation 
(ITAR). PM/DDTC records indicate that more than twenty-five 
(25) export licenses have been approved listing Tulsky 
Oruzheiny Zavoid as the manufacturer of Winchester rifles. 
This check is to determine what role Tulsky plays in the 
manufacturing of Winchester rifles. This check is also to 
establish the bona fides of Canadian end-user, The Gun Room 
(Tel: 519-746-8139). 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post Moscow is requested to determine the 
role Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavoid plays in the manufacturing of 
Winchester rifles by making appropriate inquiries to 
representatives of the company.  Post Ottawa is requested to 
establish the bona fides of end-user, The Gun Room (Tel: 
519-746-8139), by making appropriate inquiries to 
representatives of the company.  The following points are 
included for guidance: 
 
ACTION POST MOSCOW 
 
(To Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavoid) 
 
-- What is your company's relationship with Winchester and/or 
BWA Inc.? What is your relationship to Japanese company, 
Miroku Firearms MFG? Do you have a contract or agreement to 
manufacture Winchester rifles? What are the terms of this 
contract or agreement? 
 
-- Are you aware of your obligation as a manufacturer of 
United States Munitions List items under the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)? 
 
ACTION POST OTTAWA 
 
(To The Gun Room) 
 
-- How long has The Gun Room been in the business of 
importing and selling defense articles? 
 
-- What services and products are sold by your company? Who 
are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
-- Can you confirm that your company received the defense 
articles listed below? 
 
-- Are you familiar with the restrictions against the 
unauthorized re-export of US-origin defense articles? 
 
In its reply, Posts may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities and concerns about the entities involved.
