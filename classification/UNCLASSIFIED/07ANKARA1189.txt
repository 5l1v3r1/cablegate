In Today's Papers 
 
Turkish Parties Prepare for Elections 
All papers report Prime Minister Erdogan told the ruling AKP group 
meeting Wednesday the presidential election process demonstrated 
that the opposition CHP "failed the democracy test," adding those 
who obstructed the parliament's presidential vote would get their 
answer from the nation in the elections.  Erdogan said in Turkey, 
those who define themselves as social democrats do not fit this 
definition, and that this has been voiced by the social democratic 
leaders of other countries. 
 
Opposition parties CHP and DSP leaders Deniz Baykal and Zeki Sezer 
will reportedly announce their decision regarding a possible 
election alliance in a couple of days.  Talks are blocked due to a 
disagreement over the number of seats to be given to DSP, which 
wants at least 20 whereas CHP offers not more than 12 seats in the 
parliament, according to papers. 
 
Papers speculate that the AKP will nominate retired generals, 
academics, and some prominent names from all walks of life in an 
effort to convince mainstream circles that the ruling party has no 
problems with the military and establishment.  Papers also claim the 
AKP was planning to nominate some non-Muslim Turkish candidates in 
the upcoming elections. 
 
Baser Calls for Turkey-US Action against the PKK in Iraq 
Hurriyet, Radikal and several television channels report retired 
general Edip Baser, Turkey's special envoy for countering terrorism, 
said at a conference Wednesday that Turkey, if possible in 
cooperation with the US, should do whatever is necessary in Iraq. 
"Joint action is not a prerequisite for intervention in northern 
Iraq.  Turkey may solve the problem alone, but this may pave the way 
for future complications," said Baser.  Baser noted a total removal 
of the PKK presence in north of Iraq might happen at a future stage. 
 Baser also warned that using religion as a means of politics poses 
a threat against national unity and domestic peace. 
 
Plane Crash Victims Had Been Under Surveillance 
All papers report Michael Newman and Zakaullah Bhangoo, British and 
Pakistani nationals killed in a plane crash in mountainous terrain 
in Trabzon in northeast Turkey earlier this week, had been under 
Osman Gunes said.  Their bodies were found on Tuesday.  Papers 
speculate that the two men were taking nuclear secrets from Pakistan 
to Iran.  The plane landed in Trabzon on May 10 for refueling but 
had to wait until May 13 because of adverse weather conditions, 
before leaving for Tabriz on Sunday.  Bhangoo had 90 incoming 
foreign telephone calls during his two days in Trabzon, say papers. 
 
 
Supreme Court of Appeals Overturns Semdinli Verdict 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Zaman and others:  The Supreme Court of 
Appeals annulled a verdict on two non-commissioned officers Ali Kaya 
and Ozcan Ildeniz in the controversial Semdinli case where the 
military personnel were accused of planning a bomb attack on a book 
shop owned by a Kurdish activist, on the grounds that the 
investigation into the incidents in Semdinli town of the 
southeastern city of Hakkari was incomplete.  The court overruled 39 
year prison sentences for Ali Kaya and Ozcan Ildeniz and ruled that 
the case should be brought before a military court. 
 
Bathing Suit Ads Banned Once Again by Istanbul Municipality 
Cumhuriyet, Vatan, Radikal, Milliyet and others:  Leading swimsuit 
producers in Istanbul criticized the municipality for restricting 
advertisements of their products.  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet 
reports that the censorship started in 2003 when Istanbul 
Municipality covered up an ad at Istanbul airport featuring a top 
model in a 'Zeki Triko' bikini.  Bathing suit companies harshly 
criticize the municipality for the censorship, asking "are we living 
in Iran, the country of Mullahs, or Turkey?"  Istanbul Municipality

officials told press that there is no ban on ads, but added that 
there are certain criteria in the decision-making process such as 
compatibility with general moral values. 
 
Editorial Commentary on New French President Sarkozy 
Erdal Safak writes in the mainstream daily Sabah: "Sarkozy has some 
very different views on certain policy issues.  First, he enjoys 
being labeled 'Sarko the American.'  Regarding the Middle East he 
gives priority to establishing strategic partnership with Israel - 
he has never visited Palestine during his trips to Middle East so 
far.  As for the immigration issue, he pursues zero tolerance for 
illegal immigrants.  Since Sarkozy maintains a strong anti-Turkey 
attitude regarding the EU membership process, the only hope may be 
coming from his potential Foreign Minister candidate Kouchner.  Yet 
we should not be very optimistic about Kouchner since Sarkozy 
already said that he is the boss of foreign policy.   Something is 
very obvious:  We will dearly miss Jacques Chirac." 
 
Ali Sirmen writes in the leftist-nationalist daily Cumhuriyet: 
"When it comes to making a choice between the EU's biased attitude 
toward Turkey, and Sarkozy's candor, the latter is much better for 
us than the former.  He at least dares to say that Turkey should not 
be fooled any longer.  The EU does not want Turkey in it, but nobody 
is honest enough to say it.  Sarkozy is the only exception.  We 
should not get upset with his attitude, instead we should thank him 
for telling the truth."
