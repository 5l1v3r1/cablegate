SUBJECT: GREEK ECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE: DISILLUSIONMENT 
WITH AKP GROWS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary. During a January 22 courtesy call by 
Ambassador Jeffrey, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I 
requested the Ambassador's help in addressing the 
Patriarchate's problems with the government of Turkey (GOT). 
He expressed his best wishes for President Obama and his hope 
that the new administration would continue to promote good 
relations between Turkey and the United States.  Commenting 
on the Patriarchate's initial high hopes for change after the 
ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) took power in 
2002, he said the Patriarchate was "a little bit 
disappointed" by the ruling party's failure to follow through 
with reforms.  The Patriarchate is still unable to open Halki 
Seminary, must operate without a legal personality, and is 
concerned about the small pool of candidates - limited by the 
GOT - for the next Patriarchal election.  In the face of 
these challenges, the Patriarch said he remains optimistic in 
part because of the recent appointment of AKP MP Egemen Bagis 
to the position of State Minister for EU Affairs. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Patriarch expressed his best wishes for 
President Obama and his hope that the new administration 
would continue to promote good relations between Turkey and 
the United States.  Commending the U.S. for providing a 
positive example to be imitated around the world, he also 
thanked the U.S. administration for its attentiveness and 
support and for understanding the importance of the 
Patriarchate.  The Patriarch stressed that the "civilized 
world needs to keep the Patriarchate in this place" and said 
he counted on the Ambassador to continuously remind the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the problems the Patriarchate 
faces.  He noted that the Patriarchate had also expected 
great things from the GOT after the ruling Justice and 
Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2002 because they 
are close to religion and would better understand the 
Patriarchate's situation and needs.  "But now we are a little 
bit disappointed." The Patriarchate is unable to reacquire 
"mazbut" (seized) foundations despite the amendment of the 
Foundations Law in 2008, cannot reopen Halki, still does not 
have a legal personality, and faces a very small pool of 
eligible candidates under the GOT's current interpretation of 
how the Holy Synod can elect a new Patriarch.  According to 
the Patriarch, the Patriarchate has no avenue for dialogue 
with the GOT in which to put forth its concerns and 
proposals.  He cited the example of a proposed mixed 
commission of the Ministry of Education with representatives 
from the Patriarchate.  Minister of Education Huseyin Celik 
demurred, stating that such a commission was for foreigners 
and the Greek Orthodox in Turkey were part of the Turkish 
family. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Patriarch said he cannot understand why the GOT 
"insists so much on not reopening Halki."  He related a 
conversation with Celik who said he did not see any legal 
problems with the reopening of the seminary and suggested 
that reopening Halki "may come soon with so much progress in 
the country."  The best proof to the world of Turkey's 
tolerance would be the opening of Halki, the Patriarch said, 
and entreated the Ambassador to help in reopening Halki.  The 
Ambassador said he will do all possible to support the 
Patriarchate and suggested that the Patriarchate also press 
the GOT to solve these concerns before Istanbul takes on the 
mantle of the European City of Culture in 2010. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In the face of these challenges, the Patriarch said 
he remains optimistic in part because of the recent 
appointment of Istanbul AKP MP Egemen Bagis to the position 
of Minister to EU Affairs.  According to him, Bagis has a 
better understanding of the Patriarchate's problems and is 
better poised to affect change with the EU. Specifically, he 
said the Turkish administration needs to understand that the 
Patriarchate is not a threat to Turkey, but instead a 
privilege.  The Patriarch said he was hosting Bagis for 
dinner at his residence that evening to further deepen their 
discussion of these issues.
