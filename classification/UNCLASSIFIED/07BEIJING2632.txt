SUBJECT: APRIL 19 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: SIX-PARTY TALKS, BDA, 
SUDAN, CONVICTION OF HUSEYIN CELIL, UNSC REFORM, ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS IN COLOMBIA 
 
¶1. Key points at the April 19 MFA Press Conference made by 
MFA Spokesman Liu Jianchao were: 
 
-- The spokesman repeated previous statements that the 
relevant parties are close to solving the BDA issue, but some 
technical questions remain. 
 
-- China says now is "not the proper time" for sanctions 
against Sudan. 
 
-- The conviction of Huseyin Celil on charges of terrorism 
fall within China's internal affairs and Canada cannot 
interfere. 
 
-- Despite consensus reached with Japan during PM Wen's 
visit, China's stance on UNSC reform has not changed. 
 
No New Information on BDA Issue 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  At the April 19 regular press briefing, MFA Spokesman Liu 
Jianchao repeated previous statements that the relevant 
parties are close to solving the BDA issue, but some 
technical questions remain.  Responding to a question on the 
matter, Liu said he had no information on specific measures 
taken by DPRK account-holders to retrieve funds. 
 
"Not the Proper Time" for Sanctions on Sudan 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  The spokesman said now is "not the proper time" for 
sanctions against Sudan.  China reiterated its satisfaction 
with consensus reached between Sudan and the UN on former 
Secretary General Annan's plan and called for relevant 
 
SIPDIS 
parties to take constructive measures promoting this 
"positive progress." 
 
Uyghur, Canadian Citizen 
------------------------ 
 
¶4.  Liu confirmed reports that Huseyin Celil was sentenced by 
the Urumqi Intermediate Court to life in prison and lifelong 
deprivation of political rights because of his organizing, 
leading and participating in terrorist activities.  Asked for 
comment on Canada's calls for consular access to Celil, who 
is a Canadian citizen, Liu stated the matter is an internal 
affair of China and Canada has no right to interfere. 
Regarding a possible visit to China by Canada's Foreign 
Minister, the spokesman said relevant information will be 
released when arrangements have been set. 
 
No Change in Position on UNSC Adjustments 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Asked if consensus reached during PM Wen's recent trip to 
Japan led to a change in China's position on UN Security 
Council reform, Liu responded that China's stance on said 
reforms is the same.  There are deep differences on this 
issue at the present and patient, democratic negotiations are 
still needed, said Liu.  He added China is against "forced 
reform plans of any kind" if such differences exist. 
 
Illegal Immigrant Arrests in Colombia 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  China has noticed reports of Chinese citizens arrested in 
Colombia and is against illegal immigration of all kinds, 
stated Liu.  The spokesman emphasized that illegal 
immigration is an international issue with complicated 
economic, social and political factors and efforts to 
crackdown on such activity cannot depend on China alone. 
Once the relevant persons are confirmed to be Chinese 
citizens, China will cooperate in the process of 
repatriation.
