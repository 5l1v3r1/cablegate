SABAH / ZAMAN / EVRENSEL / CUMHURIYET:  Terrorist leader 
Abdullah Ocalan will be confined to his cell for twenty days 
reportedly for making PKK propaganda. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   The daily claims that Ocalan was given a 
20-day confinement penalty in his cell for recently saying that 
he could make a call for PKK to declare cease-fire, reportedly 
ahead of September 1 Peace Day celebrations. 
 
CUMHURIYET:     The report the MIT intelligence center presented to 
the National Security Council claimed that while the U.S. 
engaged in efforts to appoint an envoy who would work out a way 
for Turkey and the PKK to hold talks and negotiate, the U.S. at 
the same time reportedly entered into negotiations with the PKK 
on disarmament issue. 
 
HURRIYET:       U.S. Ambassador Ross Wilson said that the envoy the 
U.S. would appoint to coordinate the tasks with Turkey in the 
fight against the PKK was determined.  Wilson also said that the 
envoy was a person whom Turkey knew very well and everybody 
would get surprised when his/her name would be announced. 
 
SABAH:  PKK reportedly made a press announcement in the 
Qandil Mountain in Iraq as a response to the U.S.'s call to PKK 
to lay down arms.   PKK reportedly explained the conditions

during an operation Turkish authorities were conducting against 
Hezbollah six years ago, had been brought back by the FBI to 
Turkey's agenda in the days when Turkey is weighing the issue of 
contributing troops to the UN force in Lebanon.   According to

sympathy in favor of Hezbollah in the Turkish community through 
blurring the differences between the Hezbollah in Turkey and
