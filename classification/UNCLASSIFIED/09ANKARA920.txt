In Today's Papers 
 
TGS Chief General Basbug's Press Conference 
All weekend papers report on the response by TGS Chief Ilker Basbug 
to allegations that the army was involved in a conspiracy against 
the government.  General Basbug, in a press conference on Friday, 
dismissed as just a "piece of paper" the alleged document found in 
the office of Ergenekon suspect Serdar Ozturk which supposedly 
contained a strategy for combating fundamentalist groups.  General 
Basbug called on the prosecutors to find out who manufactured the 
plan. He said the plan was prepared to wear down the army. He said 
that the media was manipulated in an "asymmetrical psychological 
war" targeting the army.  General Basbug added that the campaign 
against the army was a problem of Turkish national security.  He 
also said that the army was planning to share its uneasiness with 
the developments at the next meeting of the National Security 
Council (MGK) scheduled to take place on June 30. 
 
Parliament Passes Two Reforms Targeting the Military Judiciary 
All papers:  AKP's midnight amendment aiming to limit the authority 
of military courts has caused tension between the ruling AKP and 
main opposition CHP.  The AKP made a one word changeto Article 250 
of the Criminal Procedure Law.  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet says 
with this amendment, the parliament paved the way for the trying of 
military personnel, including the Chief of General Staff, by 
civilian courts.  The paper notes that the regulation is considered 
an intimidation against the General Staff.  The government says that 
the amendment was passed after debates with the opposition while the 
CHP insists that they were not informed in advance about the 
arrangement.  Liberal-intellectual Radikal reports that  during a 
party group meeting in Kocaeli, PM Erdogan responded to the CHP's 
criticism and said "we passed it against those who support military 
intervention.  All party groups lifted their arms when asked who was 
accepting the law." 
 
Editorial Commentary 
Tufan Turenc wrote in mainstream Hurriyet: "The PM is asking the 
political parties and the media to act responsibly. But he himself 
is busy with coup scenarios and the Ergenekon investigation. He 
doesn't realize that this strategy damages himself, his party and 
the country. Turkey has many problems, and it can't find an 
opportunity to discuss even one of them. 
 
 
OSCE Foreign Ministers Meeting in Corfu 
Mainstream Sabah reports that Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu had 
a sincere and constructive meeting with Greek FM Bakoyanni  at the 
OSCE meeting in Corfu and Turkey and Greece reached consensus for 
the settlement of problems.  FM Davutoglu held meetings with the 
Foreign Ministers of other countries who were attending the meeting. 
 However, he did not have a meeting with Armenian FM Nalbandian and 
Turkey and Armenia failed to make any progress in bilateral ties at 
the meeting. 
 
New Formulas to Re-Open the Halki Seminary 
Mainstreams Hurriyet, Milliyet and Vatan report that the Turkish 
government is getting prepared to reopen the Halki Seminary in 
Heybeliada.  Sunday's Milliyet quoted Culture Minister Ertugrul 
Gunay saying "the seminary is not compatible with the current 
university system in Turkey, but the government might find a 
different formula for it.  There are no political problems, and 
technical preparations for the opening of the seminary continue." 
Today's Milliyet quotes State Minister Egemen Bagis as saying "The 
Halki Seminary should be re-opened.  The orthodox community in 
Turkey are Turkish citizens who pay their taxes and fulfill their 
military services.  If they need religious personnel to have a 
happier life, then we should help them to realize this."  Vatan says 
that according to CNN Turk, a report was prepared on the demand of 
Education Minister Nimet Cubukcu.  In the report, two alternatives 
were suggested.  The high school section of the seminary will be 
opened as a special religious school just like vocational religious

high schools, or Imam Hatips, and the college section of the 
seminary will be under the Higher Education Council's (YOK) 
supervision.  The second alternative is the opening of the seminary 
within the structure of a foundation.  The paper notes that the 
patriarch prefers the second alternative. 
 
PM Erdogan Criticizes the EU 
Saturday's Milliyet reports that during his visit to Brussels, PM 
Erdogan harshly criticized initiatives designed to block Turkey's EU 
bid and European politicians giving support to such initiatives 
saying that European politicians manipulated Turkey's EU entry in 
their campaigns before the European elections. 
 
Editorial Commentary on the Turkey-US Relationship 
Omer Taspinar wrote in mainstream Sabah: "The honeymoon with the 
Obama administration is coming to an end leaving itself to serious 
problems again. The problems mainly are: first, the normalization 
period with Armenia is stuck; second, Turkey doesn't look very 
enthusiastic on EU issues; and the last, Ankara's reaction to the 
Iranian elections.  Turkey has to create a balance between realism 
and democracy which is crucial in foreign policy."
