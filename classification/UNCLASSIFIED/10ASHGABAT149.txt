¶1. (C) Despite numerous email inquiries from Iranians to the 
Consular Section asking about applying for visas in 
Turkmenistan -- many who make appointments are ultimately 
no-shows -- it appears that the cumbersome Turkmen visa 
process still prevents most potential applicants from getting 
across the border to Ashgabat (reftel).  Recently, however, 
the Consular Section has seen a slight increase in Iranian 
applicants.  They report to us that its proximity to Iran, 
and the absence of an interview backlog, makes Ashgabat an 
attractive alternative to applying in either the UAE or 
Turkey. 
 
¶2. (C) During the past week, we spoke with three Iranian 
applicants.  One had traveled from Esfahan.  In addition, a 
couple from the northern city of Shirvan, who said that 
despite the cost (most contracted with a travel agency, who 
arranged for the visa, land transport from the border, hotel 
and registration), about $2000 for a 3-4 day stay, it was the 
easiest way to apply.  Since Iranian applicants require extra 
processing and there is no way to courier passports to them 
in Iran, they must make the trip twice. 
 
ESFAHAN: "IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY, IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK" 
 
¶3. (C) Ali, a 28-year engineer from Esfahan, was applying for 
an H1-B (skilled professional) visa to work in Iowa.  He was 
married recently and his wife, also an engineer, has a 
separate petition pending and plans to work for the same 
firm.  Ali described the demonstrations in Esfahan last 
summer following the disputed presidential election.  He said 
he participated in three of them and that the largest, on 
Quds Day, had about one million participants.  He described 
the security forces as "merciless" in the violence they used 
against them.  After he learned of his U.S. visa prospects, 
Ali chose to stay home and avoid involvement.  "When you have 
a family, it's a huge risk to demonstrate.  If someone gets 
arrested, there will be no one to care for their children, 
for their parents." 
 
¶4. (C) Ali said that his own parents were involved in the 
movement to oust the Shah in the late 70's, but now feel 
"ashamed" at what that brought about.  Notwithstanding 
Esfahan's general more conservative populace, he said, the 
people there are "fed up with the mullahs" and want Iran's 
leaders to be "tried for their crimes."  He advised that the 
only way to bring an end to the "dictatorship" in Iran would 
be to freeze the foreign bank accounts of Iran's leaders and 
the Revolutionary Guards (IRCG).  "The people of Iran are 
looking to the U.S. for support," he said. 
 
FROM SHIRVAN: "PLEASE RESCUE US FROM THESE MULLAHS" 
 
¶5. (C) Hussein and Fatemeh, an elderly couple from the 
northern city of Shirvan, plan to visit their son, who is 
studying for a Ph.D in Pennsylvania.  When asked about the 
situation at home, they said, "Everyone wants this regime to 
be gone.  People want freedom."  Fatemeh described how, 
following Friday prayers in Shirvan, people leaving the 
mosques are compelled to take part in pro-government rallies. 
 One of the few Iranian women in Ashgabat we've seen wearing 
hijab, Fatemeh said that she had always worn it. "Even back 
when the Shah was in power."  Nevertheless, she disagrees 
vehemently with laws that force all women to cover in public. 
 "It should be up to women to decide," she said, "not the 
mullahs."  Hussein, who attends Friday prayers regularly, 
said, "All we have now are mosques.  Under the Shah, there 
was a liquor store on one corner and a mosque on the next. 
We're tired of everything being imposed on us."  Both said 
that "everyone in Iran" wants the country to reestablish 
relations with the U.S.  "Because of Ahmadinejad, we have 
poor relations with every country in the world with the 
exception of China and Venezuela.  It's a disgrace."  Hussein 
added, "We're counting on Obama to rescue us from these 
mullahs." 
 
¶6. (C) COMMENT:  From just these three cases, it is difficult 
 
ASHGABAT 00000149  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
to conclude -- though it would certainly appear -- that 
there are many in Iran as vehemently anti-regime as we have 
seen so far.  It is is interesting to note, however, that 
individuals who, at first glance, seemed to be from widely 
different backgrounds share such strong feelings about the 
direction Iran is going.  We will continue to monitor and 
report on public opinion as visa applicants from northern 
Iran trickle in.  END COMMENT.
