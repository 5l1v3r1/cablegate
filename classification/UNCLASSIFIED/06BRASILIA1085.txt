¶1.  On May 23, 2006, Embassy delivered to Secretary Everton F. 
Lucero, Chief of the Division of Science and Technology, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (DCTEC/MFA), for review and approval, the National 
Institutes of Health's (NIH) proposed award of a research project 
titled "Double Negative, CD4-CD8 T Cells in Human Leishmaniasis," or 
NIAID International Research in Infectious Diseases (IRID) R03, 
(number AI06625201A1).  The site covered in this project is under 
the direction of Dr. Kenneth J. Gollob, at the Federal University of 
Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil. 
 
¶2.  The Embassy sees no adverse foreign policy implications with 
respect to this research project.  We emphasize the importance of 
complying with Brazilian laws on the export of data and biological 
material. 
 
¶3.  We are providing this assessment of foreign policy implications 
in advance of receiving approval from the Brazilian Government for 
the proposed research to go forward, in order to assist NIH in 
completing the domestic review process.  Upon receipt of Brazilian 
approval, the Embassy will notify NIH by cable.
