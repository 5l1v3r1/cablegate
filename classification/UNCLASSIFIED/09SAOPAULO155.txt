SUBJECT:  Media Reaction: G-20 Finance Ministers' Meeting; Sao 
Paulo, Obstacles to a G20 deal against the crisis, March 19, 2009 
 
Title- Obstacles to a G20 deal against the crisis 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Economico (3-19) states: "G20 
Finance Ministers....did not reach a deal in their meeting last 
weekend....divergences acted as a backdrop to the disputes between 
the countries that used to have a lot of economic power and are 
losing it to those who had little and are now gaining [in 
influence].  There is not a fast solution to the impasse, but 
tactical commitments aimed at precise objectives to take the world 
out of the crisis might work".
