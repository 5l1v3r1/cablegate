SUBJECT: DEMARCHE REQUEST:  TRANSPORT AND LOGISTICS UNITS 
FOR THE UN-AU HYBRID OPERATION IN DARFUR (UNAMID) 
 
 
¶1. This is an action request. See paras 4 - 6. 
 
Objective 
--------- 
 
¶2. To encourage host countries with appropriate capabilities 
to contribute the ground transport and logistics assets 
sought by the UN-African Union hybrid peacekeeping operation 
in Darfur (UNAMID) and for which there are currently no 
offers from any troop contributing countries (TCCs). 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶3. Ensuring rapid and successful deployment of the UNAMID 
peacekeeping operation to Darfur is an extremely high USG 
foreign policy priority.  While progress in actual deployment 
remains disappointingly slow, African and other TCCs have 
made at least tentative offers for most of the military and 
much of the police personnel mandated by the UN Security 
Council for this force as well as many key enabling assets. 
UNAMID currently has over 9,000 military and police personnel 
on the ground and several important contingents are expected 
to deploy over the next two to three months.  However, the 
mission's ability to operate over an extremely large area 
often with difficult terrain is severely limited by its lack 
of adequate transportation assets (both air and ground); 
deployments and effectiveness are also limited by a shortage 
of logistics assets needed to construct and maintain camps 
and other infrastructure in this harsh environment.  The UN 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) continues to 
seek up to 24 helicopters (which have been the topic of 
extensive diplomatic efforts by the USG and others) as well 
as two medium-heavy transport companies and one multi-role 
logistics company. This demarche request focuses on target 
countries which may be able to provide the necessary ground 
transport and/or logistics companies. 
 
Action Requests 
--------------- 
 
¶4. For Embassies:  All Action Embassies (For Launda,only if 
post believes it would be appropriate) are requested to 
approach host government officials at the highest appropriate 
level to request that they contribute a transport company to 
UNAMID; Embassy New Delhi is also requested to ask that the 
Indian government consider providing a multi-role logistics 
company to UNAMID; other Embassies may make the same request 
at their discretion if there is information at post to 
suggest that your host country may be able to deploy such a 
unit.  Washington believes that militaries in all your host 
countries are likely to have the necessary assets at least 
for the transport companies (approximately 30 trucks per 
company plus associated drivers and maintenance personnel). 
Pakistan, India and Bangladesh currently provide similar 
transport assets to other UN peacekeeping operations and 
India also has the proven ability to deploy the more complex 
multi-role logistics company to a UN peacekeeping mission. 
South Africa and Angola have not previously deployed such 
assets to a UN PKO but we believe it worth exploring their 
willingness to do so.  Details of the precise UN requirements 
for this mission will be provided by unclassified email in a 
form that can also be passed to host governments as 
appropriate. 
 
¶5. For USUN:  Mission is requested to double-track these 
requests with military advisers and/or civilian staff of 
relevant counterpart missions in New York and with UN DPKO's 
Force Generation Service (FGS). 
 
¶6. Posts may draw on the following points in approaching host 
governments: 
 
-- An effective UN-AU peacekeeping operation is an essential 
element of international efforts to bring a lasting peace to 
Darfur. 
 
-- While there are at least tentative commitments for most 
military personnel needed by the mission in its start-up 
phase, the UN and AU still seek transport and logistics 
assets which are critical for the mission to operate 
effectively in the large Darfur region. 
 
STATE 00023831  002 OF 002 
 
 
-- We believe your military may have the necessary ground 
transport (if appropriate:  and logistics) assets to 
contribute to the success of UNAMID.  We urge you to give 
serious consideration to such a contribution, which would be 
greatly appreciated by the UN and AU as well as the United 
States. 
 
¶7. Deadline:  Please respond by COB March 12.  POCs in IO/PSC 
are Grace Kang, LTC James Thomas and Doug Wake.
