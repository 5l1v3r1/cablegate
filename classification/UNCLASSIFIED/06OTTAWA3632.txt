SUBJECT: CANADA TAKES ECONOMIC ACTION AGAINST BELARUS 
 
 
¶1. (U) On December 18, Foreign Minister MacKay and 
International Trade Minister Emerson announced that Canada is 
taking new measures against Belarus by limiting Canadian 
exports to that country.  "Canada remains very concerned that 
Belarus continues to ignore international appeals to restore 
democracy," said the Foreign Minister.  "From a flawed 
election to the continued imprisonment of democratic 
supporters, Belarus persists in its flagrant abuse of human 
rights and the rule of law.  Canada and the international 
community must keep pressure on Belarus to improve conditions 
for its people."  Minister Emerson said that "it is Canada's 
hope that economic pressure in the form of export 
restrictions will help bring about positive change in 
Belarus." 
 
¶2. (U) Adding Belarus to the Area Control List means that all 
exports from Canada to Belarus require an export permit 
issued under the authority of the Export and Import Permits 
Act.  Canada announced its intention to consider this action 
in July and took into account the views of affected parties 
during the consultation period.  All applications for permits 
to export items to Belarus will be reviewed on a case-by-case 
basis.  Permits for humanitarian items-- including food, 
clothing, medicine, medical supplies, information material, 
casual gifts and personal effects of persons going to Belarus 
from Canada -- will generally be approved  Permits for other 
items will generally be denied. 
 
¶3. (U) Comment:  Given the low level of Canadian exports to 
Belarus, this measure is largely symbolic.  As was the case 
when the GoC refused in April to grant landing and refueling 
privileges to a plane carrying Belarus Prime Minister 
Sidorsky, this latest step is calculated to demonstrate 
Canada's concern over the human rights situation in Belarus. 
End comment.
