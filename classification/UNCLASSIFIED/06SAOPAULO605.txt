"Uribe's Reelection" 
 
Liberal Folha de S. Paulo (5/31) editorialized: "Reelected with 62% 
of votes, the returns are the confirmation of [Colombia's President] 
Alvaro Uribe's hard line against the guerrillas and crime.... The 
intensification of the presence of the Army and the police has 
helped to reduce common criminality.... The return of the sense of 
security in the major cities is the mainly due to Uribe's victory. 
In regards to drug traffickers, the 'democratic security' policy was 
less effective despite the USG's USD 500 million annual assistance. 
The drug barons' power has been reduced, but not to the point of 
jeopardizing that activity, which is the main source of corruption 
in the government and that of financing the guerrilla. In his second 
term Uribe must consolidate such achievements and enlarge them, by 
forcing the Farc to negotiate. He will also need to work in fronts 
other than security. Priority must be given to the economy. Included 
in the agenda are the approvals of a tax reform and the ratification 
of a FTA with the US."
