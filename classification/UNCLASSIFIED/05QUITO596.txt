¶1.  Minister of Labor Raul Izurieta telephoned LabOff on 
March 15 to respond to a non-paper the Embassy had delivered 
on March 2 (reftels).  Izurieta said he had seen a summary of 
the ILO's proposed budget for 2006-2007.  He did not comment 
on the organization's budget, but hopes that the ILO will not 
raise its dues.  Ecuador's priorities for the ILO include 
obtaining an ILO review of Ecuador's labor laws, receiving 
support for reforming GoE-conducted labor inspections, 
improving in-country occupational health and safety, and 
receiving ILO support for Ecuador's National Labor Council.
