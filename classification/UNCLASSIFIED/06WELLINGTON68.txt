SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION- ADMIRAL FALLON'S NZ VISIT 
 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: After a recent meeting with New Zealand Prime 
Minister Helen Clark, Admiral Fallon's clear but non- 
confrontational style was particularly well-suited to 
delivering a US perspective to the New Zealand media. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. The New Zealand media/public was left in no doubt that 
the US stands by its assessment that New Zealand's existing 
anti-nuclear legislation presents problems to the 
maintenance of regional security. 
 
The South Island's largest circulation daily, Christchurch- 
based "The Press," summed up the Admiral's stance. BEGIN 
TEXT. Fallon indicated the status quo remained over ship 
visits, but emphasized that the US saw New Zealand as a 
close friend... Asked if he was indicating a softening of 
the US attitude towards New Zealand's nuclear-free stance, 
Fallon said: "I wouldn't characterize that at all. This 
isn't about softening or hardening or anything. This is 
about getting to know the leadership of this country. I'm 
not in the policy-making business. I'm a military officer 
and I've got plenty on my fleet to do right now." END TEXT. 
 
The country's largest circulation daily, the Auckland-based 
"New Zealand Herald," ran the same quote noting that it was 
a mistake to interpret the Admiral's visit to New Zealand as 
a softening of the US position. BEGIN TEXT. Asked whether 
his presence was a sign of a softening of the US attitude to 
New Zealand's nuclear-free policy, Admiral Fallon, who 
reports to US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, said he was 
"not in the policy-making business, I'm a military officer." 
END TEXT. 
 
The editorial in the "Otago Daily Times" agreed. 
BEGIN TEXT. It is doubtful any minds were changed last 
Friday, when the man in charge of the United States Pacific 
Command, Admiral Fallon, met Prime Minister Helen Clark. END 
TEXT. 
 
¶3. The Admiral successfully guided the New Zealand media to 
examine the state of the bilateral relationship and question 
long-held assumptions, instead of simply rehashing old 
arguments. 
 
Even the "New Zealand Herald" sub-header noted, "Visiting 
American admiral deftly navigates our nuclear shoals." The 
article further indicated that the New Zealand media had not 
missed the Admiral's message. BEGIN TEXT: "It is about the 
willingness to be open to discussion ... it's about getting 
to know the leadership of this country." He said there 
should be a willingness to discuss and challenge assumptions 
taken as bedrock. END TEXT. 
 
The Admiral's comments on trust were also picked up by the 
"Otago Daily Times," which ran an editorial entitled, 
"Mutual Trust?" The newspaper's conclusions included the 
observation that the status quo is not in New Zealand's 
interests. BEGIN TEXT: What has not changed in 20 years is 
that we (NZ) continue to forfeit the advantages of a close 
and beneficial relationship with the only power in a 
position to guarantee our security. END TEXT.
