REF:  RIO DE JANEIRO 302 
 
¶1.  Brazilian state-controlled oil company Petrobras signed an 
agreement on October 31 to explore for oil in Cuba's still untapped 
offshore fields, which Cuban energy officials say may hold more than 
20 billion barrels of reserves.  Petrobras agreed to make an initial 
investment of USD 8 million to begin exploration of a block just off 
Cuba's northern coast east of Havana.  The contract gives Petrobras 
7 years to explore and 25 years to produce oil and gas in a 
production-sharing contract with Cuba.  Brazilian President Lula and 
Cuban President Raul Castro attended the signing ceremony in Havana. 
 
¶2.  Cuba has divided its offshore area in the Gulf of Mexico into 59 
blocks, about half of which have been leased to seven companies from 
around the world (none of them American due to the U.S. trade 
embargo).  Petrobras got block number 37 near the onshore fields 
from which Cuba currently produces most of its 60,000 barrels per 
day of oil.  Petrobras' block covers 1,600 square kilometers and 
includes waters 1,640 feet (500 meters) to 5,250 feet (1,600 meters) 
deep.
