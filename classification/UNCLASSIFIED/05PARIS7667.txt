(SBU) Poloff discussed reftel demarche November 8 with French 
MFA IO Human Rights desk officer Donatienne Hissard.  On 
Sudan, Hissard expressed regret to hear that the EU-draft 
language calling for a moratorium on the death penalty would 
preclude U.S. co-sponsoring and lobbying assistance.  On 
Burma, Hissard reacted with genuine surprise that the EU 
draft's inclusion of language provided by the regime in 
Rangoon had rendered U.S. co-sponsorship problematic.  She 
argued the Burma resolution was customarily adopted by 
consensus, hence the consultation with Burmese officials. 
She anticipated that there would be an EU response to the 
U.S. points.
