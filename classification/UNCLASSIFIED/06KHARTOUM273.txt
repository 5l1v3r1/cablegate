¶1. (U) This is an action request for EB/EPC - see para 4. 
 
¶2. (U) In reply to the letter dated January 16, requesting 
assistance in securing imports of railway parts(reftel), the 
Charge replied to First Vice President Salva Kiir on January 
¶29.  Text of the letter follows. 
 
(Begin text) 
 
Thank you for your letter of January 4 regarding processing 
export licenses for the Government of National Unity's 
proposed purchase of railroad and river transport barge 
spare parts from U.S. suppliers. 
 
I have informed U.S. authorities of the interest of both 
parties to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in rebuilding 
the rail line to Wau and in improving river transport from 
Kosti to Juba.  These lines could be used to develop the 
South, assist in the return of internally displaced persons, 
redeploy military forces, and facilitate the delivery of 
humanitarian supplies to the South and Darfur. 
 
I am confident that your request will receive full 
consideration in any decision to approve a waiver of U.S. 
economic sanctions.  Such a decision can only be made, 
however, in response to the filing of an application for an 
export license by a U.S. exporter with the Office of Foreign 
Asset Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of Treasury. 
 
Do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of assistance in 
this matter. 
 
(Signature)

¶3. (U) In a separate but related development, poloff met on 
February 1 with the Minister of Transport, Kuol Manyang 
(SPLM).  The minister provided a copy of a letter dated 
January 7, 2006, from Sudan Railways to GE Transportation 
Systems Division in Erie, PA.  The letter requests 
assistance in releasing railway spare parts which were 
impounded and remain in Belgium because of the imposition of 
U.S. economic sanctions.  Attached to the letter is a 12- 
page list of parts for engines, air compressors, airbrakes, 
electrical parts, and miscellaneous items.  A copy of the 
cover letter has been scanned and emailed to AF/SPG. 
(Comment:  The letter was sent via courier, but it was 
addressed simply to GE Transportation Systems Division, and 
not to an individual. The minister's staff said they have 
yet to receive a reply. End Comment.) 
 
¶4. (U) Action requested:  EB/EPC is requested to advise 
Embassy Khartoum if and when export license requests are 
submitted pertaining to the above purchase proposal.
