REJECTION OF USG EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE AFTER HURRICANES 
GUSTAV AND IKE 
 
POLOFF delivered demarche detailing USG efforts to deliver 
emergency assistance to Cuba following Hurricanes Ike and 
Gustov to Jose Antonio Lorenzana, Director of Multilateral 
Affairs, on October 7.  Details of the non-political-nature 
of the emergency aid package as well as its value and 
proposed impact were explained.  Lorenzana stated that many 
countries have come to the aid of Cuba, including Honduras, 
and asked about the assistance rendered by U.S.-based private 
NGOs and religious groups, such as the Mormon Church, of 
which he is a member. He thanked us for the information and 
said he would pass it on to the FM.
