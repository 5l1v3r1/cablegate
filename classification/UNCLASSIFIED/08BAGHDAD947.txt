FOUNDATION 
 
REF: STATE 30627 
 
The Iraq Middle Market Development Foundation (IMMDF) is well 
and favorably known to Embassy Baghdad.  To answer reftel 
request, we are not aware of any ties to terrorism, money 
laundering, corruption or violations of the law associated 
with IMMDF.  In fact, we strongly support the work IMMDF does 
to bring open transparent investment to Iraq at this critical 
juncture in its history.  We have no objection to OPIC's 
proposed Direct Loan to IMMDF.
