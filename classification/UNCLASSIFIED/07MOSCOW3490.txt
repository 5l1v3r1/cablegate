UZBEKTELECOM, TASHKENT, UZBEKISTAN, LICENSE NO.

REFTEL: 1. USDOC 05393 DATED 12/20/05 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, JSC Uzbektelecom, Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The 
company is listed on BIS license application D341584 
as the ultimate consignee of two cesium frequency 
clocks, model: PRS45-0002. These items are controlled 
for national security reasons under ECCN 3A002. The 
licensee is Symmetricom Inc., 2300 Orchard Pkwy, San 
Jose, CA 95131. 
 
¶3. On July 11, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with JSC 
Uzbektelecom (UT), 24, Amir Temur st., Tashkent, 
Uzbekistan. The export control team met with Khakim 
Mukhitdinov, General Director and Margarita Kashina, 
Head of International Relations Department. 
 
¶4. UT was founded in 1992 to provide 
telecommunications services to Uzbekistan. UT is an 
open joint-stock company, with 94% of the shares owned 
by the Government of Uzbekistan, 3% owned by 
employees, and 3% owned by the Judiciary of 
Uzbekistan.  UT hopes to sell 49% of the company 
shares to a foreign strategic investor.  UT employs 
20,300 in 19 divisions, including regional 
telecommunications providers and specialized 
departments.  The company also has interests in 12 
telecommunications related joint ventures. 
 
¶5. The cesium primary reference sources (PRS) in 
reftel are used in the UT national telecommunications 
network control system, located at the Tashkent 
Telegraph Station.  The PRS systems synchronize the 
network, providing stable and highly accurate time 
signals to the switching network.  The devices have no 
other uses and are not accessible outside of the UT 
technical network.  The units are stable, and working 
well.  As UT expands it's digital switching network, 
it will require 3 or 4 new PRS units, which it is 
considering sourcing elsewhere due to the 7 to 8 month 
wait for U.S. export licenses.  ECO Pearce advised 
that the turnaround time for a future license should 
be shorter.  Mr. Mukhitdinov is familiar with U.S. 
export controls and the conditions of the license. 
 
¶6. The team was brought to the Tashkent Telegraph 
Station (TTS), a specialized department of UT, located 
at #28 A. Navoi Str, Tashkent.  TTS controls the 
international and long-distance switching networks for 
UT.  In addition, the center provides satellite 
uplink/downlink facilities for broadcasting.  The team 
was shown two TimeCesium PRS-4400 clock systems, s/n 
0608006812 and 0613007244.  The clocks are rack- 
mounted in the IT center of the TTS building.  Access 
to the TTS facility is restricted due to the sensitive 
nature of the systems resident in the building.  A 
proximity card system is used to control access, and 
visitors must be escorted at all times.  Corporate 
security officers patrol the facility 24 hours a day, 
and a video surveillance system is in place.  Three 
specialists have direct daily access to the system, 
and one engineer is responsible for monitoring the 
clocks. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends JSC Uzbektelecom, 
Tashkent, Uzbekistan as reliable recipients of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
