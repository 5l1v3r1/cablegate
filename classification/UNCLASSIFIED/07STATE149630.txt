     ¶B. PRETORIA 3604 
     ¶C. STITZIEL-YILLA-MARBURG EMAILS OF 16-24 OCTOBER 
        2007 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 4-5. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) thanks post for its initial response 
(Ref B) to our Blue Lantern request concerning license 
05-1003562 (Ref A). 
 
¶3. However, post's findings did not enable PM/DTCC to close 
the case.  PM/DTCC and desk have made several attempts to 
follow up with post (Ref C) but have not received any 
response. 
 
¶4. Ref B reported that foreign intermediate consignee 
Connector & Wire Services (CWS) returned and canceled all 
consignments exported under license 05-1003562.  As explained 
in Ref C, it appears that CWS may have confused two separate 
orders/licenses, 05-1003562 and 05-1005743.  The following 
details the history of these two licenses: 
 
--License 05-1003562:  30 units of M28840/502WA were exported 
to CWS in August 2006.  25 units of M28840/11AB1P1 were 
exported to CWS in September 2006 and then an additional five 
(5) units were exported to CWS in October 2006.  According to 
the U.S. exporter (Joslyn Sunbank Co LLC), none of these 
units were ever returned. 
 
--License 05-1005743:  55 units of M28840/11AB1P1 were 
authorized for export to South Africa but were never shipped 
because CWS canceled the order, according to Joslyn Sunbank. 
70 units of M28840/502WA were shipped in October 2006 but 
were to returned to Joslyn Sunbank in November 2006. 
 
¶5. Thus, it is understandable that CWS might be under the 
impression that it returned all connectors of both types to 
Joslyn Sunbank in November 2006.  However, according to the 
U.S. exporter, CWS never returned and should still have all 
60 connectors exported under license 05-1003562. 
 
¶6. Department requests that post re-contact CWS in order to 
obtain the information necessary to close this Blue Lantern 
check.  Post should ask CWS to recheck its records in an 
attempt to resolve the discrepancies between its initial 
response as reported in Ref B and the records obtained from 
Joslyn Sunbank.  If CWS admits that it in fact did not return 
the connectors exported under license 05-1003562, post should 
make appropriate inquiries to determine the current 
disposition and use of the items, as outlined in PM/DTCC's 
original Blue Lantern request cable (Ref A). 
 
¶7. Failure to close this Blue Lantern check will affect 
pending and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶8. Please slug reply for PM/DTCC - BLUE LANTERN COORDINATOR 
and include the words "Blue Lantern" and the case number in 
the subject line.  POC is Judd Stitziel, PM/DTCC, Phone: 
202-663-3455.
