¶1. (U) Chief Judge Nurdin announced that witness testimony 
would begin next week in the trial of the seven men accused 
of killing two Amcits in Timika, Papua in 2002.  Beginning on 
September 5, trial sessions will take place twice a week, on 
Tuesdays and Fridays, in order to accommodate the number of 
witnesses scheduled to testify.   As expected, Judge Nurdin 
ruled against the "exception" submitted by the defense on 
August 8, declaring that the Supreme Court's decision to move 
the trial from Timika to Jakarta was binding (ref B).  The 
defendants again refused to recognize the court's authority 
and take their assigned seats in the courtroom, and Judge 
Nurdin ordered them removed from the courtroom for the second 
straight week.   Lead Defense attorney Johnson Panjaitan did 
not attend the session, although other attorneys from the 
Indonesian Legal Aid Society (PBHI) were present. 
 
¶2. (U) An estimated 50-100 Papuans staged a demonstration 
outside the courthouse in support of the defendants.  Many 
also attended the session but did not disturb the 
proceedings.  A smaller rally sponsored by the West Papuan 
People's Front for Unified Struggle took place outside the 
Embassy on August 28.   According to Embassy contacts, the 
permit for the protest was filed by Socrates, a student at 
Cendrawasih University in Jayapura, Papua.
