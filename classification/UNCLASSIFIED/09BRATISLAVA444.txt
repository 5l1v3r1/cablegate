We delivered reftel points to Zdenko Galbavy, Acting Deputy 
Director in the MFA Department of United Nations and Other 
International Organizations, and the Human Rights Department. 
The Human Rights Department said the message was "well-received" 
and Galbavy told us Slovakia would be pleased to coordinate in 
New York and Geneva.  In previous discussions regarding the 
report, senior MFA officials told us Slovakia's position would 
be consistent with the U.S. one.
