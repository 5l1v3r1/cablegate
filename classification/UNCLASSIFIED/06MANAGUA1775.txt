Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
 
In view of the intensification of the crisis in the Middle 
East, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Nicaragua: 
 
Expresses its deep consternation for the alarming and 
increasing number of fatal victims, injuries, and displaced 
persons that especially affect the civilian population, and 
above all, children and women from the area. 
Demands an immediate cessation of military operations by all 
involved parties in the conflict. 
States that it is imperative to stop the sacrifice of 
innocent victims.  There is no justification for the loss of 
innocent civilian lives.  Respect for human life and its 
protection is the most important priority and the highest 
value of international society, and all types of terrorism -- 
wherever it comes from -- is condemnable and must be stopped. 
Insists that real security be established and guaranteed for 
both the United Nations personnel and its physical 
installations in the area, in order to provide the civil 
populations with humanitarian aid, and that UNIFIL members 
facilitate an urgent cease fire. 
Accepts the words of the UN Secretary General to the effect 
that the Security Council must act rapidly and firmly in this 
crisis in order to strengthen the image of this vital body of 
the UN in its critical task of preserving peace and 
international security. 
 
Nicaragua reiterates the need to make the United Nations 
mechanisms effective, including the observance of 
international law, especially international human rights, and 
the quest at all costs for a peaceful, fair and durable 
solution while respecting Lebanon's sovereignty.
