In Today's Papers 
 
Turkey-Iraq Sign MOU against Terror during Maliki Visit 
All papers give extensive front-page coverage to the Ankara visit of 
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki with a high level delegation. 
Papers have mixed reactions to the visit, with the Islamist papers 
viewing the signing of a "Memorandum of Understanding" (MOU) 
regarding cooperation against PKK activities in Iraq as a "positive 
development."  Mainstream papers as well as Cumhuriyet and Radikal 
claim Turkey and Iraq have failed to sign an "agreement" to combat 
terror, but "signed an MOU" instead, with some claiming the 
president of the Kurdish regional administration, Massoud Barzani, 
"intervened to prevent an agreement."  Cumhuriyet says that "once 
again, Turkey sees no forward steps from Iraq against the PKK." 
Papers note Erdogan and Maliki agreed to sign an agreement with 
regard to cooperation against terror "in two months."  Responding to 
press questions after meeting with Erdogan, Maliki said the 
agreement covered "the Iraqi Kurdish administration as well." 
 
Papers also report the two delegations signed another MOU on 
economic cooperation, according to which Turkey would build power 
plants in Iraq, and Iraqi natural gas to Europe would be routed 
through Turkey.   Papers and television reports say if finalized, 
the deal would help Turkey become an effective energy center. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Maliki Visit 
Business daily Referans columnist Cengiz Candar observes: "The 
Maliki visit to Turkey is not a 'dramatic' moment in history. 
Turkey can never achieve tangible and meaningful results unless 
Ankara develops a direct relationship with the Iraqi Kurds, and puts 
the PKK problem within the framework of that context.  The most 
striking lesson of the Maliki visit for Turkey should have been that 
Turkey can neither solve the PKK problem nor emerge as a regional 
power in the Middle East without ending its obsession of basing its 
foreign policy as well as ties with the US solely on the PKK 
question." 
 
In tabloid Posta Mehmet Ali Birand notes the "chaotic" political 
situation in Baghdad, saying it would not be realistic for Turkey to 
expect Maliki to take effective measures against the PKK: "In talks 
with visiting Iraqi PM yesterday, Ankara will ask Maliki to persuade 
Massoud Barzani to move against the PKK in northern Iraq.  Maliki, 
however, is in no position to ask anything from the Kurds due to the 
Kirkuk referendum controversy... Barzani bargains with Turkey saying 
the PKK will be controlled if Turkey stays out of Kirkuk and does 
not intervene into northern Iraq militarily.  Turkey should 
understand the tough situation Maliki has been going through, and 
should not expect much." 
 
In tabloid Star columnist Nasuhi Gungor praises the AKP government 
for taking "bold forward steps" with regard to the Kurdish problem, 
establishing ties with the leading Sunni groups in Iraq and also 
telling the Iraqi Shiites that " Iran is not your only door to open 
to the world." Gungor continues: "the presence of FM Zebari and 
Baghdad's anti-terror envoy al-Waili in the high-level Iraqi 
delegation visiting Turkey shows Turkey's determination in the fight 
against terrorism.  There are, however, no easy solutions; if Turkey 
wants to take significant forward steps, it needs to abandon some 
political habits such as turning a blind eye to some developments in 
Iraq.  The July 22 elections were actually an expression of this 
fact." 
 
Uncertainty over Presidency Causes Controversy 
All papers continue speculation with regard to the names the AKP 
will nominate for parliamentary speaker and president.  Former 
Parliament Speaker Bulent Arinc implied at a press briefing Tuesday 
he wants the post of Justice Minister in the new cabinet.  Arinc 
said he won't run for Parliament Speaker.  Mainstream papers say 
Koksal Toptan has emerged as Erdogan's favorite candidate for the 
post.

Hurriyet claims Prime Minister Erdogan plans to give the presidency 
to an AKP deputy whose wife does not wear the Islamic-style 
headscarf, rather than offer it to Abdullah Gul.  Hurriyet, Radikal 
and Cumhuriyet claim some AKP members believe Gul would be a very 
successful president, but that a new, compromise candidate would be 
better in avoiding new tensions.  They expect Gul not to run. 
Milliyet notes that the presidential issue might lead to a rift 
between Erdogan and Gul.  Vatan speculates Erdogan does not want Gul 
confined to the presidential palace, but wants to share government 
responsibilities with him.  Supporters of Gul, however, say that Gul 
has to follow the preferences of voters who showed powerful support 
for the AKP in the elections.  Yesterday Arinc said, in remarks 
interpreted by mainstream press as a warning against Gul, all party 
members should help facilitate the PM's tough job now. 
 
Violence in Southeast Turkey Continues 
All papers report that the funeral of the officer who was killed in 
a PKK landmine blast in the Diyarbakir province was held in Ankara 
Tuesday, with the participation of President Sezer, Foreign Minister 
Abdullah Gul, some cabinet ministers and military commanders. 
Papers report Gul remained silent when the wife of the martyred 
officer said she didn't want to see any AKP members in the funeral. 
Another lieutenant killed by a PKK landmine in Hakkari was laid to 
rest in Istanbul. 
 
Greek Lobby Introduces Anti-Turkey Bills to Congress 
Hurriyet, Sabah, Cumhuriyet and Radikal report the Greek lobby in 
the US has introduced to the US House two separate bills demanding 
Turkey pull back its troops from Turkish Cyprus.  The bills say 
Turkey has "invaded" Cyprus, and US weapons were illegally used in 
the invasion.  Hurriyet says the Greek lobby "routinely" introduces 
anti-Turkey bills into Congress on the eve of the anniversary of the 
Turkish military operation against Cyprus and during US election 
campaigns.
