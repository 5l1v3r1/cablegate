¶1. Summary: The Hang Seng Index followed the other Asian markets 
down sharply on Wednesday, falling 8.16 percent.  The IMF's warning 
that losses from U.S. loans and securitized assets could reach 
US$1.4 trillion appeared to drive investors to dump shares.  In a 
presentation in Hong Kong, the IMF unveiled analysis that suggested 
the U.S. financial downturn would be "longer and larger" than 
expected, hitting bottom only in Q2 2009.  The Hong Kong Monetary 
Authority announced it would cut its base interest rate by 100 basis 
points, beginning on Thursday.  The HKMA's move couldn't stop HIBOR 
from rising 75 basis points for overnight lending and 45 basis 
points for three month loans.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  The Hang Seng Index plummeted on Wednesday, October 8, falling 
1372.03 points to finish at 15431.73, down 8.16 percent, on volume 
of HKD 78 billion.  Utility stocks, typically seen as a safe harbor 
for investors, led the market lower.  Financial stocks also fell 
sharply.  China Construction Bank dropped 12 percent on market 
rumors that Bank of America would sell its state when the lock-up 
period expires at the end of October.  Bank of China (Hong Kong) and 
Bank of East Asia slipped 9 percent, ICBC was down 8 percent, Bank 
of China fell 6 percent, and HSBC and Hang Seng each slid 4 
percent. 
 
IMF Sees Larger, Longer Economic Downturn in 2009 
 
¶3.  In a presentation unveiling this year's World Economic Outlook, 
IMF Asia-Pacific Research head Roberto Cardarelli, explained the 
Fund's development of a Financial Stresses Index that identified 
periods of financial turmoil over the past 20 years.  According to 
its model, only half of the periods of financial stress identified 
led to economic slowdowns.  However, those periods of stress that 
were preceded by banking crises tended to result in economic 
downturns that were longer and larger than expected.  The effects 
were particularly pronounced when household and corporate borrowing 
rates were high, real housing prices were up and credit was a higher 
percentage of GDP, said Cardarelli. 
 
¶4.  Cardarelli added that the Fund would release its Global Economic 
Forecast on Thursday, October 9.  The Fund has revised its earlier 
prediction that the U.S. economy would reach the bottom by end 2008 
and now expects the economy to continue contracting through the 
second quarter of 2009, he said.  Those countries that rely on 
exports to the U.S. are likely to face mounting difficulties. 
 
HKMA Reduces Base Rate, HIBOR Increases 
 
¶5.  The HKMA announced today that it would reduce its Base Rate, the 
reference rate for discount window borrowing, by 100 basis points, 
beginning Thursday, October 9.  The rate has been set at 150 points 
above the U.S. Federal Funds Target Rate and is announced each day 
before the opening of the interbank market in Hong Kong.  The new 
rate tomorrow will be 2.5 percent, down from 3.5 percent today. 
HKMA Chief Executive Joseph Yam noted that the Hong Kong rate has 
been higher than in other places.  Given the stressful global 
financial conditions a cut is now justified, he said. 
 
¶6.  The move did not help HIBOR in Hong Kong, which saw overnight 
rates jump from 1.75 percent on Monday (Tuesday was a holiday) to 
2.5 percent.  The benchmark three month rate also moved up, gaining 
45 basis points to 4.25 percent.  One week rates were 3.75 percent, 
one month was 4.7 percent, six months was 3.95 percent and one year 
rates were 3.75 percent.
