Â¶1. (U) Post transmits the official correspondence from the 
Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs regarding its request for 
support for its candidacy on the Council of the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO) Part III for the 2007-2010 time period. 
 Please see the unofficial translation of the letter below. 
 
UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION 
 
The Department of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States of 
America and has the honor to remind the latter of the Government of 
Indonesia's request for the valuable support of United States of 
America for Indonesia's candidature to the Council of International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Part III for the period of 
2007-2010, at the elections to be held during the 36th General 
Assembly of ICAO in September 2007. 
 
The Government of the Republic of Indonesia views that air transport 
services are crucial to economic development and the improvement of 
living standards, particularly if viewed from the perspective of 
geographical and demographic challenges. Indonesia has a population 
of more than 220 million people spread over a vast archipelago of 
17,000 islands. In concordance with Indonesia's current and 
forecasted economic growth, the scheduled passenger traffic is 
expected to continue growing from the total passenger traffic in 
2006 of 34 million passengers. Therefore the Government is 
constrained to develop air transport infrastructure more thoroughly 
than roads and railways. Air transport infrastructures are needed to 
continue open up Indonesia's markets and thus provide its citizens 
with access to trade, human resources, natural resources and 
products. 
 
Nevertheless, Indonesia shares the view that it is imperative to 
create an environment in which international air transport may 
develop and flourish in an economical manner without risking or 
compromising safety and security. Thus, Indonesia understands the 
great importance of reforming the state of its aviation, 
particularly in the field of safety and security. 
 
In this regard, during the recent Strategic Aviation Safety Summit 
in Bali, the Government of Indonesia and ICAO have made a 
groundbreaking declaration in which Indonesia committed itself to 
wide ranging action for improving the safety of its civil aviation 
system and ICAO will lend the necessary support to ensure the 
implementations. 
 
To foster the healthy growth of Indonesia's civil aviation, the 
Government of Indonesia also understands the importance of engaging 
a larger multilateral cooperation in the field of aviation. Hence, 
Indonesia attaches great importance to being a member on the Council 
of ICAO. The Government believes that through membership on the 
council, Indonesia can play a responsible and constructive role in 
the sustainable development of a safe and secure international civil 
aviation. 
 
The Department of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia 
avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the 
United States of America the assurances of its highest 
consideration.
