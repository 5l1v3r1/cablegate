Chapter 6 Investment Climate Statement FY2009, continued 
 
6.8 Transparency of the Regulatory System 
 
The Companies Act of 1973 provides for the transparent 
regulations concerning the establishment and operation of 
businesses.  Under the Act, for-profit businesses employing 
more than 20 persons must register as a company within 21 
days.  The same rules apply to foreign companies, with the 
exception that foreign companies may elect to operate as an 
"external company" (with no limit on legal liabilities). 
In general, businesses must also register with the local 
Regional Services Council, the Department of Labor, the 
Workman's Compensation Commissioner, the appropriate 
industry council,and the South African Revenue Service. 
All businesses must obtain an operating license from local 
authorities.  The validity of an operating license is 
indefinite unless a business is sold or relocated.  The 
forms to be filled out by investors are straightforward. 
The process takes six months on average, but can be done in 
one month through TISA.  Almost all buisness activities are 
open to foriegn investors.  The government does not 
prohibit or officially discourage a foreign-owned business 
from locating in a particular region of the country. 
Restrictions that apply to a particular industry apply to 
both domestic and international investors.  Exceptions 
exist in the areas of banking and defense.  For example a 
branch of a foreign bank may be required to employ a 
certain number of South Africans and maintain a minimum 
local capital base to obtain a banking license when these 
requirements are not applied to domestic banks.  In addition 
a foreign company must register as an external company 
before immovable property can be registered in its name. 
 
6.9 Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment 
 
South Africa's banks are well-capitalized and comply with 
international banking standards.  Six of the 35 banks in South 
Africa are foreign-owned and 15 are branches of foreign banks. 
The "Big Four" (Standard, ABSA, First Rand, and Nedcor) dominate 
the sector, accounting for almost 85 percent of the country's 
banking assets, which total over $240 billion.  Barclays' 
acquisition of ABSA received government approval in 2005.  The 
International Commercial Bank of China purchased a 20% stake in 
Standard Bank in late 2007 and the government approved the sale 
in early 2008.  The SARB regulates the sector according to the 
Bank Act of 1990.  There are three alternatives for foreign 
banks to establish local operations, all of which require SARB 
approval.  These include the establishment of: 1) a separate 
company; 2) a branch; or 3) a representative office.  The 
criteria for the registration of a foreign bank are the same as 
for domestic banks.  Foreign banks must include additional 
information, such as holding company approval, a letter of 
"comfort and understanding" from the holding company, and a 
letter of no objection from the foreign bank's home regulatory 
Qletter of no objection from the foreign bank's home regulatory 
authority.  More information on the banking industry may be 
obtained from the South African Banking Association at the 
following website: http://www.banking.org.za/. 
 
The Financial Services Board (FSB) governs South Africa's non- 
bank financial services industry (see website: 
http://www.fsb.co.za/).  The FSB regulates insurance companies, 
pension funds, unit trusts (i.e., mutual funds), participation 
bond schemes, portfolio management, and the financial markets. 
The JSE Securities Exchange SA (JSE) is the fourteenth largest 
exchange measured by market capitalization in the world.  Market 
capitalization stood at R4.4 billion ($466 million) in December 
2008 with over 400 firms listed.  The Bond Exchange of South 
Africa (BESA) is licensed under the Financial Markets Control 
Act.  Membership includes banks, insurers, investors, 
 
PRETORIA 00000081  002.2 OF 008 
 
 
stockbrokers, and independent intermediaries.  The exchange 
consists principally of bonds issued by government, state-owned 
enterprises, and private corporations.  The JSE is seeking to 
acquire the BESA.  More information on financial markets may be 
obtained from the JSE (website: www.jse.co.za) and the Bond 
Exchange (website: http://www.bondexchange.co.za/). 
 
Foreign investors deemed "affected persons" must obtain SARB 
approval to borrow amounts greater than R20,000 (approximately 
$2,100).  "Affected persons" are defined as companies or other 
bodies in which: 1) 75 percent or more of the capital assets or 
earnings may be used for payment to, or for the benefit of, a 
non-resident; or 2) 75 percent or more of the voting securities, 
voting power, power of control, capital, assets or earnings are 
vested in, or controlled by, a non-resident.  No person in South 
Africa may provide credit to a non-resident or "affected person" 
without an exchange control exemption.  Non-residents and 
"affected persons," however, may borrow up to 100 percent of the 
South African rand value of funds introduced from abroad and 
invested locally.  The ability to borrow locally increases if 
both residents and non-residents own the local enterprise. 
 
6.10 Political Violence 
 
South Africa's political landscape is changing as the nation 
approaches national elections in 2009.  The Congress of the 
People (COPE) is a new opposition party that was formed largely 
as an offshoot of the ruling African National Congress (ANC). 
There were isolated cases of political violence in 2008, and 
there exists some potential for sporadic campaign violence in 
the run-up to 2009 elections.  Criminal violence remains high. 
National and provincial governments have pursued a number of 
programs in an attempt to control or stabilize the level of 
criminal violence. 
 
6.11 Corruption 
 
The 2000 Promotion of Access to Information Act and the 2000 
Public Finance Management Act helped to increase transparency in 
government.  The 2004 Prevention and Combating of Corrupt 
Activities Act (PCCAA) defines graft, bars the payment of bribes 
by South African citizens and firms to foreign public officials, 
and obliges public officials to report corrupt activities.  One 
shortcoming of the PCCAA has been its failure to protect 
whistleblowers against recrimination or defamation claims. 
South African law also provides for the prosecution of 
government officials who solicit or accept bribes.  Penalties 
for offering or accepting a bribe may include criminal 
prosecution, monetary fines, dismissal from government 
employment, or deportation (for foreign citizens). 
 
South Africa has no fewer than 10 agencies engaged in anti- 
corruption activities.  Some, like the Public Service 
Commission, the Office of the Public Protector, and the Office 
of the Auditor-General, are constitutionally mandated to address 
corruption as only part of their responsibilities.  High rates 
of violent crime are a strain on capacity and make it difficult 
for South African criminal and judicial entities to dedicate 
adequate resources to anti-corruption efforts. 
 
Parliament voted to disband the South African Police Anti- 
Corruption Unit and the Directorate for Special Operations (more 
QCorruption Unit and the Directorate for Special Operations (more 
popularly known as the "Scorpions") and fold its jurisdiction 
into the National Police in October 2008. 
 
Transparency International's 2008 Corruption Perceptions Index 
reports that corruption in South Africa is perceived to be 
greater than it was in 2007.  South Africa was ranked 43rd out 
of 179 countries (where 1 is the country where corruption is 
perceived to be the lowest, and 179 is the one where corruption 
is perceived to be the greatest) in 2007 to 54th out of 180 
countries in 2008.  South Africa was the second least corrupt 
country in Africa in 2007; it was the fourth least corrupt 
country in Africa in 2008.  Public perception of widespread 
official corruption, particularly in the police and the 
Department of Home Affairs, continued.  South Africa is not a 
signatory of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery, but is a 
signatory of the UN Convention against Corruption. Transparency 
International maintains an office in South Africa.

6.12 Bilateral Investment Agreements 
 
South Africa has bilateral investment agreements with Argentina, 
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic, Finland, 
France, Germany, Greece, Mauritius, the Netherlands, the 
Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the 
United Kingdom.  A Trade, Development, and Cooperation Agreement 
went into force between South Africa and the European Union on 
January 1, 2000, but it does not contain an investment chapter. 
South Africa, as part of SACU, is currently in negotiations for 
free trade agreements with Mercosur and India. 
 
The United States began free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations 
with the five Southern African Customs Union (SACU) countries 
(South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland) in 
June 2003, but active negotiations were suspended in April 2006. 
In lieu of a U.S.-SACU FTA, the United States and SACU 
negotiated a Trade, Investment and Development Cooperation 
Agreement (TIDCA), which was signed in July 2008.  The four 
areas singled out for special attention under the TIDCA are 
customs cooperation, technical barriers to trade, 
sanitary/phytosanitary (SPS) issues, and trade and investment 
promotion. 
 
Agreements regarding mutual assistance between the customs 
administrations of the United States and South Africa became 
effective on August 1, 2001.  The U.S.-South Africa bilateral 
tax treaty eliminating double-taxation became effective on 
January 1, 1998. 
 
6.13 OPIC and Other Investment Insurance Programs 
 
South Africa and the United States signed an agreement to 
facilitate Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) 
programs in 1993.  OPIC has since invested in a number of funds 
supporting sub-Saharan Africa development, including the Africa 
Growth Fund ($25 million), the Modern Africa Growth and 
Investment Fund ($105 million), and the ZM Investment Fund ($120 
million).  OPIC also established the $350 million Sub-Saharan 
Africa Infrastructure Fund (SAIF), which intends to fund 
infrastructure projects in sub-Saharan Africa. OPIC helped the 
National Urban Reconstruction and Housing Agency (NURCHA) to 
establish a $31 million scheme to lend to small contractors for 
the construction of affordable houses.  OPIC entered into an 
agreement with the Homeloan Guarantee Company (HLGC) to fund 
low-income home loans for HIV-positive South Africans in 2004. 
The pilot program for this project was initiated in 2005.  Net 
proceeds from a $300 million investment pool will be used to 
purchase medication for HIV-positive South African homeowners 
holding HLGC guaranteed mortgages.  OPIC announced in June 2008 
that it will provide up to $250 million to banks and financial 
institutions to expand their lending to small businesses. 
Additional information on OPIC programs that involve South 
Africa may be found on OPIC's website: http://www.opic.gov/. 
 
South Africa is also a member of the World Bank's Multilateral 
Investment Guarantee Agency. 
 
6.14 Labor 
 
The South African government has worked to remove all vestiges 
of apartheid-era labor legislation over the last 14 years.  In 
its place, the government created a labor market characterized 
by employment security, reasonable wages, and decent working 
Qby employment security, reasonable wages, and decent working 
conditions.  Under the aegis of the National Economic 
Development and Labor Council (NEDLAC), government, business, 
and organized labor negotiated all labor laws, with the 
exception of laws pertaining to occupational health and safety. 
NEDLAC negotiations placed a high value on worker rights and 
collective bargaining. 
 
The law allows almost all workers to form or join trade unions 
of their choice without previous authorization or excessive 
requirements.  As of March 2008, total trade union membership 
was roughly three and one half million persons, or 31 percent of 
the economically active population employed in the formal 
sector.  Most union members belong to affiliates of the Congress 
of South African Trade Unions (COSATU).  Other unions are 
 
PRETORIA 00000081  004.2 OF 008 
 
 
affiliated to the Federation of Unions of South Africa (FEDUSA) 
or the National Council of Trade Unions (NACTU).  COSATU, the 
largest of the federations, is strongly allied with the African 
National Congress (ANC) and the South African Communist Party in 
a tripartite alliance and vigorously lobbies the ruling party to 
implement its policy positions. 
 
The right to strike is protected under South African labor law. 
A Department of Labor bulletin reported 102 strikes in the 2006- 
2007 year ending March 2007, with 264,426 workers participating 
and over four million work days last.  Data for 2007-2008 has 
not yet been released.  Sectors most affected have historically 
been community services, manufacturing, mining, and retail. 
South African business argues that the labor market is rigid and 
over-regulation has constrained employment.  Trade unions argue 
that employers evade labor legislation through the use of labor 
brokers who supply casual workers.  COSATU has lobbied for and 
welcomed a pledge by the Minister of Labor that the next ANC 
government will outlaw all labor brokers.  Other areas of 
contention between business and trade unions revolve around 
workplace safety, the application of wage structures to all 
firms in an industry whether or not firms participated in wage 
negotiations, wage increases, and complex requirements and 
appeal procedures for the dismissal of workers. 
 
Major labor legislation includes: 
 
-- The Labor Relations Act, in effect since November 1996, 
provides retrenchment guidelines, stating that employers must 
consider alternatives to retrenchment and must consult all 
relevant parties when considering possible layoffs.  The Act 
enshrines the right of workers to strike and of management to 
lock out workers.  The Act created the Commission on 
Conciliation, Mediation, and Arbitration (CCMA) which can 
conciliate, mediate, and arbitrate in cases of labor dispute, 
and is required to certify an impasse in bargaining council 
negotiation before a strike can be legally called.  The CCMA 
enjoys substantial popularity among workers and has a caseload 
in excess of what was anticipated. 
 
-- The Basic Conditions of Employment Act, implemented in 
December 1998, establishes a 45-hour workweek as well as minimum 
standards for overtime pay, annual leave, and notice of 
termination.  It outlaws child labor.  No employer may require 
or permit overtime expect by agreement, and overtime may not be 
more than ten hours per week. 
 
-- The Employment Equity Act of 1998 prohibits unfair employment 
discrimination and requires large and medium-sized employers to 
prepare affirmative action plans to ensure that black Africans, 
women, and disabled persons are adequately represented in the 
workforce. 
 
-- The Occupational Health and Safety Act, last amended in 1993, 
provides for occupational health and safety standards and gives 
the Department of Labor the right to inspect the workplace.  The 
Mine, Health and Safety Act authorizes the Inspector of Mines to 
provide regulatory oversight for the mining industry. 
 
-- The Skills Development Act of 1998 imposes a levy on 
employers equal to one percent of the payroll that is to be used 
for training programs devised by industry-specific training 
Qfor training programs devised by industry-specific training 
authorities (SETA?s).  Employers who provide job skills training 
can claim back much of their contribution from government. 
According to the March 2008 Labor Force Survey (LFS), the 
official unemployment rate was 24.2 percent.  This rate uses the 
International Labor Organization (ILO) definition of 
unemployment, which excludes persons who have not actively 
sought employment during the previous four weeks.  Despite the 
high unemployment rate, South Africa has a shortage of skilled 
workers across many sectors and businesses allege that their 
statutory contributions to government sponsored training 
authorities are wasted or misused and that those authorities 
have done little to increase the skills base. 
 
South Africa has no country-wide minimum wage, but the Minister 
of Labor has issued determinations that set a minimum wage for 
certain occupations where collective bargaining is not common. 
These occupations include domestic workers, farm workers, taxi- 
 
PRETORIA 00000081  005.2 OF 008 
 
 
drivers, and retail employees.  In addition, the Minister can 
apply collective bargaining agreements to firms that did not 
participate in negotiations. 
 
Companies have complained about the introduction, through a 
regulation in early 2003, of a two percent training levy on the 
salaries of expatriates in order to enter the country under an 
expedited visa procedure.  This money goes directly to industry- 
specific training authorities (SETA's).  The levy does not apply 
to expatriates already resident in the country or to inter- 
company transfers.  Expatriates who enter the country under the 
normal visa procedure are exempt from the levy, but the normal 
process is complex and time-consuming.  The government's 
decision to implement the levy-based system through regulation 
rather than legislation has also been controversial.  A legal 
challenge to the regulations further delayed the implementation 
of new immigration legislation and this created more uncertainty 
about the effective handling of applications for visas. 
 
6.15 Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports 
 
South Africa designated its first IDZ in 2001.  IDZs offer duty- 
free import of production-related materials and zero VAT on 
materials sourced from South Africa, along with the right to 
sell into South Africa upon payment of normal import duties on 
finished goods.  Expedited services and other logistical 
arrangements may be provided for small to medium-sized 
enterprises, or for new foreign direct investment.  Co-funding 
for infrastructure development is available.  There are no 
exemptions from other laws or regulations, such as environmental 
and labor laws.  The Manufacturing Development Board licenses 
IDZ enterprises in collaboration with the South African Revenue 
Service (SARS), which handles IDZ customs matters.  IDZ 
operators may be public, private, or a combinatioQof both. 
IDZs are currently located at Coega near Port Elizabeth, in East 
London, Richards Bay, and at OR Tambo International Airport near 
Johannesburg.  An IDZ in Mafikeng is expected to be approved by 
Cabinet in 2009. 
 
6.16 Foreign Direct Investment Statistics 
 
Foreign direct investment (FDI) data is readily available in 
South Africa, but published statistics vary depending on their 
source and definition.  AmQg the numerous institutions that 
provide foreign investment data, the U.S. Embassy in South 
Africa relies mostly on the SARB.  SARB statistics conform to 
the IMF definition of FDI (i.e., FDI is generally defined as 
ownership of at least 10 percent of the voting rights in an 
organization by a foreign resident or several affiliated foreign 
residents, including equity capital, reinvested earnings, and 
long-term loan capital) and represent actual investment, 
excluding announced but not completed "intended" investment. 
The SARB does not provide country-specific figures that 
distinguish between actual investment flows and changes in 
investment stocks caused by asset swaps, exchange rate 
adjustments, and mergers and acquisitions.  This makes it 
difficult to track the United States' and other countries' FDI 
position in South Africa on an annual basis. 
 
Because SARB statistics only provide an annual total for all the 
countries' flows combined, observers also often consult more 
Qcountries' flows combined, observers also often consult more 
updated information obtained from the South Africa-based firm 
"Business Map" (BM).  The latter offers fee-based services for a 
wide range of investor-related data and analysis (website: 
http://www.businessmap.co.za/).  The following FDI statistics 
were drawn from the SARB's December 2008 Quarterly Bulletin. The 
conversion exchange rate used was the average exchange rate for 
each year cited.

Since 1994 many foreign firms have opened or re-opened offices 
in South Africa.  There are an estimated 600 American companies 
(including subsidiaries, joint ventures, local partners, agents, 
franchises, and representative offices) doing business in South 
Africa. 
 
Key Investment Industries in South Africa: 
South Africa is largely a food self-sufficient country, with 
imports of wheat, oilseeds, poultry and pork largely offset by 
exports of fresh fruits, vegetables, fruit juice, and wine. The 
bulk of the population's food needs are supplied locally.  In 
certain instances, South African food and beverage companies 
have become global players, such as beer producer SAB Miller. 
Major international agro-processing companies with a presence in 
South Africa include Unilever, Nestle, Coca-Cola, Groupe Danone, 
Parmalat, Kellogg, HJ Heinz, Cadbury-Schweppes, Virgin Cola, 
McCain Foods of Canada, and Pillsbury. 
 
The chemical industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the 
South African economy, accounting for five percent of GDP.  The 
country is a world leader in the manufacture of synthetic fuel 
from coal. In addition to Sasol and PetroSA Fischer-Tropsch- 
based synthetic fuel operations, four oil refineries dominate 
the petroleum and petrochemical industry.  The rest of the 
chemical manufacturing sector consists mainly of AECI, 
Sentrachem, and fertilizer plants. 
 
The Standard, ABSA, First Rand, and Nedcor commercial banking 
groups provide retail and investment banking services and 
dominate the South African banking industry.  The European, 
Malaysian, and U.S. banks with banking licenses have so far 
concentrated on corporate rather than retail banking.  Foreign 
banks have gained market share through acquisition, as in the 
case of ABSA, by offering competitive lending rates. 
 
The South African automotive and components industry includes 
Ford, General Motors, Volkswagen, Bavarian Motor Works, Daimler, 
Chrysler, Nissan, and Toyota, all of which benefit from the APDP 
QChrysler, Nissan, and Toyota, all of which benefit from the APDP 
and have production plants in South Africa.
