¶1.  On May 12, 2006, Embassy delivered to Secretary Everton F. 
Lucero, Chief of the Division of Science and Technology, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (DCTEC/MFA), for review and approval, the National 
Institutes of Health's (NIH) proposed award of a research protocol 
titled "SSCOR in Pediatric Heart Development and Disease," (number 1 
P50 HL 074734 03).  The site covered in this project is under the 
direction of Dr. Jose Eduardo Krieger, at the University of Sao 
Paulo Heart Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
 
¶2.  The Embassy sees no adverse foreign policy implications with 
respect to this research project.  We emphasize the importance of 
complying with Brazilian laws on the export of data and biological 
material. 
 
¶3.  We are providing this assessment of foreign policy implications 
in advance of receiving approval from the Brazilian Government for 
the proposed research to go forward, in order to assist NIH in 
completing the domestic review process.  Upon receipt of Brazilian 
approval, the Embassy will notify NIH by cable.
