SUBJECT: SPAIN:  ICAO ASSEMBLY DEMARCHE RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 168335 
 
We were informed that the Spanish delegation to the ICAO 
General Assembly will be headed by Mr. Manuel Bautista, 
Director General of Civil Aviation. 
 
In response to our reftel demarche, we received via fax the 
following in its unofficial translation: 
 
"We agree with you to give complete support of the Spanish 
administration in the Work Program of the ICAO, related to 
Protection and Operational Security and Environment, without 
forgetting of course the rest of the ICAO programs, 
especially in favor of the harmonized development of 
international civil aviation, and indeed they are of special 
interest for the majority of ICAO countries, or of high 
priority for less-developed countries, or for those countries 
in our cultural area."
