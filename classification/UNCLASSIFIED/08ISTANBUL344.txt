SUBJECT: BSEC EXCUTIVE CALLS U.S. PROJECT AN EXEMPLAR, 
SUPPORTS SECOND PHASE 
 
(SBU)  Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) Assistant to the 
Secretary General Kostas Zaimis warmly received a copy of the 
executive summary of USAID and USEA Regional Model 
Development and Network Analysis Report. On June 24 at a BSEC 
ad hoc working group on electrical networks (AHWGEEN) Zaimis 
thanked the U.S. along with USAID and USEA for their 
sponsorship of the Black Sea Regional Transmission Planning 
Project. He stated it was an exemplar of what BSEC should be 
doing; engaging in a long term project over many BSEC 
countries with support from an observer nation. Gul Okan from 
the Turkish Electricity Transmission Company and Dan Preotesu 
from the Romanian Transelectrica Company made presentations 
of the project to working group attendees. 
 
(SBU) Zaimis called the second phase of this project a 
"wonderful opportunity" to conduct the type of project that 
BSEC should do. BSEC representatives supported Zaimis 
statement, with the condition that no BSEC counties should be 
left out of the project; Albania and Serbia are not included 
in the initial project area. Black Sea Trade and Development 
Bank (BSTDB) Director Orhan Aytemiz was eager to provide 
financing to implement the report's recommendations. Aytemiz 
also wanted to work with USAID on the second phase of the 
project.
