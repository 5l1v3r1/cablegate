Title - Summit of the Americas 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4-17) states: "....President 
Obama should take the opportunity and eliminate this hypocritical 
47-year trade restriction, which only increases the cohesion of the 
regime, while it punishes the Cuban population....For the agenda [of 
the Hemisphere] to advance with a greater speed, the U.S. should end 
for good this contentiousness with Cuba - which does not imply, 
evidently, [that the U.S.] stop condemning the systematic human 
right violations sponsored by the Cuban dictatorship." 
 
Title - A tournament of obvious things 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4-17) by columnist Clovis Rossi 
states: "....The problem with the 5th Summit of Americas...is the 
monotony inside its 23 pages and the 97 paragraphs of the final 
declaration.....Almost all the text could be replaced by 
the....words [we will accomplish our duties]. Even better would be 
if they really accomplished their duty instead of promising to do 
it." 
 
Title - When one does not want...[two does not fight] 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4-17) by columnist Eliane 
Catanhede notes: "The ideal would be the end of the embargo, but the 
possible is that Barack Obama announces at the Summit of the 
Americas....the beginning of an open, public and official dialogue 
with Cuba, nominating an advisor and/or mediator to the island."
