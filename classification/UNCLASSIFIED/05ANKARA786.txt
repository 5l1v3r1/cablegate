¶1.  Action Request:  Embassy Ankara seeks Washington approval 
and guidance to discuss with Turkish officials scheduling the 
second trilateral (U.S.-Iraq-Turkey) meeting on trucker 
security.  The first meeting was held November 30 in Ankara, 
followed by a bilateral Turkey-Iraq meeting December 29. 
Turkish officials proposed (ref a) that the second trilateral 
be held in February and suggested that Turkey again host the 
meeting in Ankara.  We have contacted MNF-I officials, who 
indicated that they would be available to attend meetings in 
late February or early March in Ankara.  We recommend that 
Washington ask Embassy Baghdad to discuss this proposal with 
IIG officials. 
 
¶2.  Baghdad Minimize considered.
