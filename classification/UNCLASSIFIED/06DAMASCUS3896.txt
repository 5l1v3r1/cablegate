people, according to official Syrian press (SANA).

by phone with Greek Socialist Party leader George Papandreou 
about the latest developments in the crisis and the role 
Europe could play in resolving it, according to official 
Syrian press.  Meanwhile, SARG Information Minister Mohsen 
Bilal met in Athens both with Papandreou and with Greece's FM 
Dora Pakayani, who sought to hear the Syrian position on the 
conflict in Lebanon.

discuss ongoing Israeli military action in Lebanon and
