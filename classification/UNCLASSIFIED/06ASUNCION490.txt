REF: STATE 63870 
 
On May 8, POLOFF thanked Julio Peralta, Director for 
International Organizations within the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs for Paraguay's support for the adoption of the Third 
Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions at the 
diplomatic conference in Geneva in December 2005.  POLOFF 
informed Peralta that before Israel's National Society, Magen 
David Adom (MDA), could join the International Red Cross/Red 
Crescent, the movement's statutes must be changed and that 
the issue would be raised at an upcoming international 
conference in Geneva June 19-21.  Peralta stated that he was 
pleased that the Third Protocol had passed and mentioned that 
Paraguay intended to support amendments to the statutes at 
the conference in June.
