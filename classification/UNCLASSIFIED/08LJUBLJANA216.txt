¶1. (U) In support of the Day of Solidarity With the Cuban 
People May 21 event, post will place the Washington-drafted 
op-ed in Vecer, one of Slovenia's largest dailies. We expect 
the op-ed will also be picked up by the national wire service 
and other national papers. From May 20 to 23, the Embassy 
website homepage will be dedicated to Cuba-related issues and 
will feature a Cuba fact sheet and links to the op-ed and the 
President's May 21 speech. 
 
¶2. (U) The GOS has not developed any activities in 
recognition of the Day of Solidarity With the Cuban People, 
despite our urgings (reftel A). The MFA noted that the GOS 
is presently preoccupied with the demands of the ongoing 
Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, 
including the EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit, the 
EU-U.S. Summit in June, and the approaching visit by POTUS. 
 
¶3. (U) Slovenian civil society is still quite underdeveloped 
and there are consequently few NGOs and only one that deals 
with Latin America in any way. The Center for Latin America 
focuses primarily on cultural exchanges between Slovenia and 
Latin American countries and has not organized any activities 
for the Day of Solidarity With the Cuban People.
