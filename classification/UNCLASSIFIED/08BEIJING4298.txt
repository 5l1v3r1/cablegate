  Editorial Quotes

¶1. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
"China purchases American bonds to test American sincerity" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/24): "The most recent numbers have shown 
that China has become the biggest lender to the United States, 
exceeding Japan.  China has set an example for Washington by giving 
the U.S. a hand in financial crisis when America treats China as a 
friend not an enemy.  The U.S. has reiterated the will to cooperate 
with China in financial field for many times after the crisis broke 
out. However, China needs Washington's sincerity.  The U.S. can not 
require others' cooperation when it is beneficial for itself and 
continue to hold doubts in areas of common prosperity and 
coexistence. Whether or not Washington will relax export 
restrictions on China buying high-tech products would be proof of 
Washington's sincerity. China is giving a hand in the financial 
crisis because China has realized U.S.-China economic relations 
prosper or decline together.  A resolution to American doubts is in 
the hands of the U.S. government. Washington can't expect others' 
sincerity long if its own is faked and temporary." 
 
 
¶2. U.S. DIPLOMACY 
 
"How will Hillary change US diplomacy?" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(11/24): "All the 
facts have shown that Hillary Clinton's selection as Secretary of 
State in the Obama administration is just one step from happening. 
If she is elected she will be the person who conducts Obama's 
diplomatic policy.  Hillary and Obama have different styles of doing 
things, Hillary is more right-wing than Obama and more of a 
hard-liner.  Hillary is the firmest defender of Israel's interests. 
Thus some Arabian countries have doubts that whether or not she can 
promote the Palestine-Israel talks without prejudice. But their 
common views are larger than their divergences. Hillary has placed 
more emphasis on U.S.-China relations than Obama." 
 
¶3. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"What is behind the halt in U.S.-China defense discussions?" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(11/24): "The 
temporary halt in U.S.-China discussion of defense affairs is 
because the U.S. and China are waiting and watching.  The Obama 
administration's stance on arms sales to Taiwan has become a 
critical issue in the bilateral military relationship. The Taiwan 
card, as a means to balance China, will continue to be a disturbing 
factor. If the US-China military exchanges halt, American interests 
will also be damaged.  Japanese media reported that Obama will 
definitely rearrange the bilateral military exchanges after he 
enters the White House."
