¶1. (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel on 6 January to Wendy 
Gilmore, Director of the Sudan Task Force at Foreign Affairs 
Canada.  After noting the value of regular weekly conference 
calls with DOS, UK and EU counterparts, she characterized the 
GoC's immediate efforts prior to the January 12 meeting as 
focused on development of the most effective strategy to 
convince the AU to put in a formal request for re-hatting to 
the UN. The GoC distributed a demarche request last week to 
its posts in countries with membership on the Peace and 
Security Council as well as to other key AU states and 
requested posts' response by COB January 6.  That allows for 
a continuing push early next week.  Gilmore suggested a more 
optimistic implementation date of summer 2006, particularly 
if the USG introduces a resolution in February.  The full 
transfer of authority could then take place by September 1. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Gilmore stressed that the GoC views NATO's role as 
limited due to what she characterized as the institution's 
"terrifying" impression held by many African countries.  It 
is more important to identify AMIS/UNMIS mission needs -- 
like logistics or training -- and establish ways of meeting 
them rather than integrating NATO as an institution into the 
process.  She added that some NATO member states are already 
meeting these needs bilaterally and urged that NATO, as an 
institution, "cannot be out in front" on this.  She offered, 
however, that post-transition, NATO could possibly play an 
arms-length logistical support role and offer incremental 
training.
