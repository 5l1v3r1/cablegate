¶1.  (U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Trini Gunarti, 
Deputy Director for North American Affairs at the Department 
of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU), on March 10.  Poloff stressed 
that--as a Muslim-majority democracy and contributor to 
UNIFIL--Indonesia should show support for Lebanon by 
attending the March 14 "Together:  We achieve the Lebanese 
Dream" Convention in Beirut.  The conference's objectives are 
to celebrate Lebanese unity and sovereignty, and to show to 
the world that Lebanon supports freedom and democracy. 
 
¶2.  (U) Gunarti said she was unaware of the conference but 
would raise the matter with DEPLU officials who handled 
Middle East affairs.  (Note:  Many of the key DEPLU officials 
dealing with the Middle East have already left for Dakar to 
participate in the March 13-14 OIC Summit.)
