START MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
The editorial line of widely listened to Radio France 
Internationale is sometimes critical of the United States on a 
range of foreign policy issues.  Criticism includes US 
policies in the broader Middle East.  Lucas Menget, who has 
spent time in Iraq, as well as other countries in the region, 
reports often on Middle Eastern issues, and it would be useful 
to have him meet US experts and officials who could explain 
U.S. initiatives and interests in the area.  It would also be 
useful for him to learn about Muslim Americans and their 
integration into American life.  Beyond the Middle East, 
Menget also reports on other foreign policy issues that often 
touch upon the United States.  He should better know the 
"players" who influence to some degree U.S. policy 
considerations.  He is interested, for example, in demographic 
issues such as our expanding Hispanic population and how they 
broadly affect US policy considerations.  He is also 
interested in American volunteerism and civic and humanitarian- 
minded efforts.  He would like to better understand small town 
America's interests and concerns, given that population's 
broad support for President Bush in the 2004 election. 
An individual IV program that focused on his areas of interest 
and allowed him access to federal, state and local officials, 
members of congressional committees, academics and analysts, 
as well as community leaders would enhance his understanding 
of the many considerations and influences that go into the 
formulation of US foreign policy.   His enhanced understanding 
would, we believe, eventually be reflected in more nuanced and 
informed reporting on issues pertaining to the United States 
for RFI's huge international and domestic audience.

An International Visitor Program (IVP) for Erwan Gueho would 
address the MPP Strategic Goal of Public Diplomacy and Public 
Affairs, Strategy 1 ("A Mission-wide, integrated, 
comprehensive network of outreach to audiences - directly, 
through the media, and via the Internet - supported and 
enhanced by relationships created through personal contact, 
exchanges, and other cooperative programs.") Through the IVP, 
Â¶M. Gueho would learn directly from responsible officials about 
the U.S. government's perceptions of various aspects of its 
foreign policy, allowing him to broaden his understanding of 
policies and actions that are frequently misunderstood in 
France. This would provide the basis for more perceptive 
analyses in his writing. His experiences in the United States 
could also provide material for "human interest" stories about 
Americans which would help put a "human face" on America. 
END MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD: 
Erwan Gueho would be an ideal participant in a group program 
for journalists in French focused on foreign policy issues of 
concern to Europe and the U.S., including counter terrorism 
and security issues, the future of trans-Atlantic relations, 
the changing roles of international organizations such as NATO 
and the United Nations, and global trade. Post also recommends 
the inclusion of visits to major U.S. museums and 
participation in cultural and sports activities to provide the 
broadest possible experience of life in the United States and 
to counter persistent perceptions of the U.S. as a "cultural 
wasteland".

NOMINATING-OFFICER: Richard Huckaby 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Erwan Gueho is a serious and dedicated young reporter for the 
regional daily Nord Eclair. One of his continuing 
responsibilities is the "World" section of the paper. During 
the run-up to the 2004 U.S. presidential election, he created 
an accurate and widely read series of articles on the 
electoral process, as well as details concerning the positions 
of the major candidates. The fact that he contacted the APP 
and the IRC in Paris for information indicates the seriousness 
and dedication with which he approaches his work, as does the 
fact that he is almost always present at seminars and 
conferences involving international topics. Since he writes 
for Nord Eclair, the second largest regional daily in the 
North, his work reaches a large audience over a wide 
geographical region. In a recent conversation, the Editor-in- 
Chief of the paper indicated his confidence that M. Gueho 
would be a leader in the field. For this reason, it is 
important that the U.S. government build on the positive 
relationship already established with this rising young 
reporter by providing him the opportunity to gain firsthand 
knowledge of the United States, which he has never visited, 
and to discuss foreign policy issues with officials in 
Washington.
