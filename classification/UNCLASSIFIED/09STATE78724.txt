¶1.  This is an action request for Embassy Astana (DTRO-A) and 
Embassy Kyiv (DTRO-K).  This is an info message for Embassy 
Moscow (DTRO-M/ACID) since DTRO-M has already delivered the 
START cost lists (Reftel).  Please see paragraph 2. 
 
¶2.  In accordance with Annex 14 to the START Treaty 
Inspection Protocol, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency 
(DTRA) has prepared and forwarded to embassies (via express 
mail and unclassified e-mail) START Treaty itemized cost 
lists for the period April 1, 2009, through June 30, 2009. 
Upon receipt of these lists, embassies are requested to 
deliver the lists to host nation government officials not 
later than July 31, 2009.  Embassies are further requested to 
confirm, via cable to Washington and unclassified e-mail to 
DTRA/OSAS (robert.habashi@dtra.mil and philip.smith@dtra.mil) 
the delivery of the cost lists, the name and office of the 
official to whom they were delivered, the date of delivery, 
and any comment or reaction provided at that time. 
 
¶3.  This U.S. START Treaty itemized cost list submission is 
being submitted directly to the Belarusian Government via a 
service message transmitted by the U.S. Nuclear Risk 
Reduction Center.
