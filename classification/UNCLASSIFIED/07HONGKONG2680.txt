REF: A) USDOC 09155 B) D384167 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), conducted 
a pre-license check at New A-Ikor Limited, 3/F, HKIB, 2 
Biotechnology Avenue, Tai Po Raod, Shatin, Hong Kong (A-Ikor). The 
purpose of the visit was to determine the suitability of A-Ikor to 
be a recipient of membrane filtration cassettes that are the subject 
of export license application D384167.  The items (ECCN 2B352) are 
valued at USD $11,000 and are controlled for chemical and biological 
weapons reasons (CB). The license applicant is Pall Corporation of 
East Hills, New York. 
 
¶3. On October 17, 2007, ECO visited New A-Ikor at the address listed 
above and met with Mr. Bing Lou Wong, Chief Technical Officer. 
According to Mr. Wong, the company was established in 2007 and is 
involved in the bio-pharmaceutical industry with a focus on oxygen 
therapeutic products.  It has gained exclusive worldwide 
manufacturing rights to U.S. company Ikor Inc.'s oxygen therapeutics 
(more information on the U.S. entity is available at 
www.ikorlife.com).  New A-Ikor owns a biologics manufacturing plant 
in Hong Kong (that it recently acquired from Advantek Biologics (HK) 
Limited).  More information concerning A-Ikor is available at 
www.aikor.com. 
 
¶4.  Mr. Wong stated that the membrane filtration cassettes would be 
used in the production of hemoglobin replacement therapies 
(essentially, a replacement hemoglobin delivery mechanism 
manufactured with bovine cells).  The primary initial market is for 
animal use in Europe to treat, for example, dogs that have ingested 
rat poison.  Mr. Wong provided ECO with a tour of the production 
facility, which is located at the address referenced above. 
 
¶5. At the tie visited, A-Ikor appeared to be a suitable recipient 
of the subject controlled items since it cooperated fully with the 
PLC and provided substantial information on A-Ikor's proposed use of 
the items in Hong Kong.  In addition, A-Ikor operates a line a 
business that appears consistent with the potential use of the 
ordered items.  The ECO recommends that this PLC be classified as 
Favorable.
