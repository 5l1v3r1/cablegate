¶1.  ON DECEMBER 14, FINANCE MINISTER FLAHERTY ANNOUNCED THAT, 
AS A RESULT OF BILL S-2 RECEIVING ROYAL ASSENT, THE CANADIAN 
GOVERNMENT HAS NOW COMPLETED THE STEPS REQUIRED IN CANADA TO 
GIVE EFFECT TO THE FIFTH PROTOCOL TO THE CANADA-UNITED STATES 
INCOME TAX CONVENTION.  THE PROTOCOL WILL COME INTO EFFECT 
ONCE IT HAS BEEN RATIFIED BY THE UNITED STATES AND THE TWO 
COUNTRIES HAVE FORMALLY NOTIFIED EACH OTHER THAT THEIR 
PROCEDURES ARE COMPLETE. 
 
¶2.  "MODERNIZING THIS LONG-STANDING TREATY WILL ENCOURAGE 
FURTHER TRADE AND INVESTMENT IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES 
AND HELP US TO BETTER COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY," 
MINISTER FLAHERTY TOLD THE PRESS.  "I AM HOPEFUL THAT THE 
U.S. WILL SOON RATIFY THE PROTOCOL SO THAT INDIVIDUALS AND 
BUSINESSES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER, INCLUDING 
MANUFACTURERS, CAN REALIZE THAT SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OF THE 
UPDATED TREATY."  HE ADDED THAT "IN THIS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE 
GLOBAL ECONOMY, WE NEED TO CONTINUALLY EXPLORE WAYS TO GROW, 
EXPAND, AND COMPETE.  FURTHER IMPROVING AND REFINING OUR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES, OUR LARGEST TRADING 
PARTNER, IS ESSENTIAL.  THE FIFTH PROTOCOL TO THE CANADA-U.S. 
TAX TREATY IS ABOUT LOOKING AHEAD AND BEING INNOVATIVE. 
 
¶3.  THE AGREEMENT TO MODIFY THE 1980 INCOME TAX CONVENTION 
WAS SIGNED ON SEPTEMBER 21 BY MINISTER FLAHERTY AND TREASURY 
SECRETARY PAULSON.  ACCORDING TO THE FINANCE CANADA PRESS
