  ¶1.   Under title "Will the drums of war quieten?" the 
      independent weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated its 
      September 29 editorial to encouraging President Bush 
      to heed "international public opinion" against a 
      unilateral attack on Iraq by the United States. 
      Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   "Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's move to allow 
      UN arms inspectors unfettered access to his country's 
      military facilities has deflated America's argument 
      for an attack against him, and it appears the U.S. is 
      increasingly losing the moral high ground on which to 
      legitimize a unilateral strike.  Already, there is 
      dissent in the U.S. Congress, with the Democrats 
      challenging President George Bush's proposed war, 
      while in Britain, America's closest ally in the anti- 
      Saddam Hussein crusade, even Labor parliamentarians 
      have strongly argued against subordinating British 
      foreign policy to Bush's war plans.  With France, 
      Russia and China - the other members of the powerful 
      ¶U. N. Security Council - resisting America's war to 
      topple Saddam Hussein, and the preponderant global 
      anti-war sentiment, will the U.S. finally heed 
      international public opinion and shelve its 
      unilateralist path?."
