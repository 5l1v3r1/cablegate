¶1.  On March 27, 2006, Embassy delivered to Secretary Everton F. 
Lucero, Deputy Chief of the Division of Science and Technology, 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DCTEC/MFA), for review and approval, 
the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) proposed award of a 
research protocol titled "The Role of CD28-Cells in Human Chagas' 
Disease," (number AI 066044-01A1).  The site covered in this project 
is under the direction of Dr. Walderez O. Dutra, at the Federal 
University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Brazil. 
 
¶2.  The Embassy sees no adverse foreign policy implications with 
respect to this research project.  We emphasize the importance of 
complying with Brazilian laws on the export of data and biological 
material. 
 
¶3.  We are providing this assessment of foreign policy implications 
in advance of receiving approval from the Brazilian Government for 
the proposed research to go forward, in order to assist NIH in 
completing the domestic review process.  Upon receipt of Brazilian 
approval, the Embassy will notify NIH by cable.
