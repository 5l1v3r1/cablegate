The three dailies lead with reports on the Doha Arab Summit, noting 
that Arab leaders condemned recent Israeli measures [house 
 
demolitions] imposed on Jerusalemites.  According to reporting, Arab 
leaders called on Israel to pursue peace with the Palestinians 
without delay.  Palestinian Authority President Abbas urged Arab 
leaders to exert pressure on Israel to respect signed agreements and 
urge the Middle East Quartet to insist that Israel respect its 
obligations and committment to the peace process.  Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas acknowledged Egyptian support for 
Palestinian national dialogue in Cairo and reiterated his belief 
that a national consensus government, able to communicate with the 
regional and international community, is essential. 
 
Al Quds front pages an AFP report quoting an Israeli Likud official 
announcing that members of the new government will be sworn in on 
March 31.  Al-Hayyat Al-Jadida cites a wire report about Israeli 
Premier-designate Netanyahu's expressed goal of achieving "real" 
peace with Palestinians, in support of both Palestinian and Israeli 
interests.  Netanyahu also reiterated his willingness to pursue 
negotiations with Palestinian Authority President Abbas in an 
attempt to achieve economic peace.  However, reporting notes, 
Netanyahu stated that the establishment of a Palestinian State is 
not being considered. 
 
All three dailies report on Palestinian National Land Day 
celebrations on March 30.  The celebrations included visits to 
protest tents in Jerusalem as part of the Arab League-sponsored 
"Jerusalem, Capital of Arab Culture 2009" festival.  Reporting notes 
that trees and plants were also distributed in the West Bank, Gaza 
and Jerusalem areas.

into recent allegations that Israeli soldiers targeted Palestinian 
civilians during the recent conflict in Gza. The investigation 
concluded that the allegatons are not supported by the evidence.

BLOCK QUOTES:

1)Hani Al-Masri opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title, "Doha summit faces big challenge in second Netanyahu 
Government"(03/31):  "Israel must understand that it cannot combine 
the continuation of settlement activities, siege, aggression... with 
the so-called peace process... a united Arab position [must be 
developed] to show Israel concretely that Arabs have other 
alternatives [than dealing with Israel on Isreal's terms.]

2) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial entitled, "Arab 
Summit and Land Day"(03/31):  "On Land Day, we tell Arab Leaders 
meeting in Doha that Palestine is a pure, Arab land, a land that has 
witnessed the rise of all religions and civilizations.  It faces 
many challenges that are more important than your artificial 
conflicts and personal interests.  This reminder also goes for those 
who insist on deepening Palestinian division.  To them we say, pay 
more attention to the internal conflicts and take serious action. 
[Your response to these conflicts] is the only criterion we will 
employ when judging the outcomes of any summit."
