SUBJECT: GOB ON GOALS FOR NAM AND UNGA 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Mauricio Dorfler 
convoked select members of the diplomatic community September 
12 to review GOB goals for the NAM and the United Nations 
General Assembly (UNGA).  Dorfler noted that Foreign Minister 
David Choquehuanca would serve as the NAM's vice president. 
He said the GOB's priorities include building consensus for 
the indigenous declaration at UNGA, supporting water rights 
and conservation in the interest of social peace, and 
promoting Bolivia's access to the sea.  Dorfler said the GOB 
has a unique opportunity to negotiate a corridor to the 
Pacific with Chile, and that the primary negotiations will be 
bilateral.  Given Peru's involvement, however, Dorfler said 
the GOB will also raise the long-standing dispute at the NAM 
and the OAS.  He noted that Choquehuanca would discuss access 
to the sea with Chilean Foreign Minister Alejandro Foxley at 
UNGA. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Regarding UNGA, Dorfler said Morales would speak to 
the General Assembly September 19.  He said the GOB sees 
Morales' speech as a chance to share Bolivia's political 
history and dynamic changes with the world.  According to 
Dorfler, Morales will defend nationalization of hydrocarbons 
(and assure investors of juridical security) and explain the 
Constituent Assembly's task of creating a new social pact, 
while noting the GOB's "absolute respect for democracy, rule 
of law and dialogue."  Dorfler acknowledged that the 
political opposition does not agree with the GOB on its 
reforms, but said "that's democracy."  He said Morales will 
cite examples of Bolivian consensus and dialogue, including 
his September 11 decree to support private business with USD 
12 million in credits to compensate for the likely expiration 
of ATPDEA benefits in December. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Dorfler said the GOB supports Security Council 
reform as well as more widespread reforms for the UN system, 
but provided few other details.  He suggested that the UN 
should be better able to respond to crises, implied the 
number of members on the Security Council should be changed, 
and hinted at representation on a regional basis.  Dorfler 
said the GOB would seek consensus within GRULAC on the 
Security Council veto, as well as on the candidacy of 
Guatemala/ Venezuela (Comment: There is little doubt that 
Bolivia will support Venezuela.  End comment).  In addition 
to the indigenous declaration, Dorfler mentioned migration, 
child labor, and gender issues as GOB goals for UNGA.
