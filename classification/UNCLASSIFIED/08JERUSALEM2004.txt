POSSIBLE THIS YEAR

Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
The three papers lead with news that the White House and Secretary 
of State Rice no longer believe that the conclusion of a peace 
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians is possible before the 
end of the year.  Quoting Rice from statements made en route to Tel 
Aviv, the dailies note that Rice hopes, "the Annapolis process has 
laid the groundwork which should make possible the establishment of 
a Palestinian state when the political circumstances permit."   The 
dailies add that Rice stressed the importance of documenting what 
has been achieved, "since the launch of this process with the 
encouragement of the American President."  Al Ayyam adds that Rice 
is preparing a detailed document for president-elect Obama's 
administration, outlining the points of agreement and disagreement 
in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.  All front 
pages note comments by PLO official Yasir Abd Rabbo that, "the best 
thing we have received from Rice" is the establishment of a 
committee to document these areas of agreement and disagreement. 
 
Al Quds' inside page reports on Secretary Rice's schedule of 
meetings in the Palestinian Territories, including her meeting with 
Palestinian Authority (PA) President Abbas in Ramallah and PA 
officials in Jenin for a "briefing on security developments."  The 
paper adds that Rice's visit to Jenin is meant to draw attention to 
the establishment of Palestinian state institutions, "one of the 
things that is rarely noticed."   Front pages also take note of the 
Middle East Quartet meeting on November 9 to discuss, "developments 
in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations." 
 
On an inside page, Al Hayat Al Jadida reports that PLO Chief 
negotiator Sa'eb Erekat met with Assistant Secretary of State for 
Near Eastern Affairs David Welch and Consul General Jake Walles on 
November 6 in Jericho.  Erekat is quoted reasserting the need for a 
peace agreement that is "comprehensive and includes all issues." 
Erekat expressed concerns that the political transition periods in 
the U.S. and Israel could be exploited by Israeli to escalate 
settlement activities and military "aggression." 
 
The three papers front-page photos of thousands of Palestinians 
demonstrating in Jerusalem against Israel's planned construction of 
a "tolerance" museum on the grounds of an Islamic cemetery. 
 
The three papers report on front pages that serious obstacles face 
the "national reconciliation conference" in Cairo.  Hamas has 
threatened to boycott the conference if its demands for the release 
of Hamas prisoners from Palestinian Authority prisons is not met. 
Reporting also notes Hamas "militia" arrests of Fatah members in 
Gaza and prevented a rally organized by Fatah, to commemorate the 
death of Yasir Arafat.  Meanwhile Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page 
reports that Islamic Jihad is skeptical about the success of the 
Cairo talks.  In related news, all front pages report that the PLO's 
Executive Committee declared its commitment to the Egyptian proposal 
for Palestinian unity and warned Hamas of making pre-conditions to 
their acceptance of the proposal.  The committee also says it is 
ready for legislative and presidential Palestinian Authority 
elections, according to reporting. 
 
Al Quds' front page highlights that Israeli military opened fire on 
Palestinian farmers and a foreign delegation near Khan Yunis in Gaza 
on November 6.  The paper adds that a committee of Arab foreign 
ministers has completed a report that documents Israeli 
"aggressions" in the Palestinian Territories.  In related reporting,

Al Quds' front page reports that the Israeli Defense Forces' West 
Bank Commander charged with the portfolio of "absentee property" has 
taken the unprecedented step of filing a petition to stop Israeli 
settlers from taking over land without producing ownership 
documents. 
 
In Gaza news, Al Quds' front page reports that Israel and Hamas have 
expressed willingness to extend the ceasefire agreement in Gaza. 
Efforts via Egyptian intermediaries are underway, according to the 
report. 
 
Al Quds' front page reports that president-elect Obama has begun the 
selection of his team by appointing Rahm Emanuel as White House 
Chief of Staff.  The appointment was met with satisfaction in 
Israel, the paper comments.  The paper further observes that Emanuel 
served in the Israeli Defense Forces and that his father was a 
member of the Irgun "militia."

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
1)  Al Quds' editorial opines under the title, "Rice finally 
acknowledged the truth" (11/07):  "Rice's statements [no peace 
agreement possible this year] are an acknowledgment of the outgoing 
U.S. administration's failure to achieve something that could have 
relieved us of the heavy legacy left behind by the Bush 
administration of catastrophes, wars, financial and economic 
collapse... [when the current administration] leaves the White 
House, it will pave the way for the new administration to be more 
committed and responsible, at least, that is what the Americans and 
all the world are hoping will be the case." 
 
2)  Taysy Zabri opines in Al Quds under the title, "Despite 
satisfaction... we don't have any illusions" (11/07): "Maybe Obama 
won't act in the same way as Clinton, but the content will remain 
the same.  [However] since the Obama administration will insist that 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations remain in American hands, the 
crisis will continue unless regional developments occur [to end the 
crisis] or the Palestinians adopt a new, unified policy."
