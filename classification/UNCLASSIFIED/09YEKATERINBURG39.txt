REF: STATE 54156 
 
¶1. On June 24, Pol/Econ officer drove to the address provided by 
the end-user - Pereulok Zvonkiy 12/43.  This proved to be on the 
industrial outskirts of Yekaterinburg where a few Soviet era 
block apartment buildings are mixed with warehouses, cement and 
gravel supply companies, etc.  It is clearly one of the less 
affluent areas of the city.  It is a private address.  No one 
was home, so we called Mr. Volovod on his cell phone.  He was 
somewhere in the neighborhood and arrived within five minutes. 
He did not invite us in and we talked to him sitting in the 
consulate vehicle. 
 
¶2. Volovod appeared to be about 30 years old.  He says he is 
employed by a gun shop in the town of Rezh, about 80 kilometers 
north-west of Yekaterinburg.  He hastened to explain that due to 
the economic downturn he is not working full time.  He told us 
the bullet tips will be used by him and his friends for hunting 
and target shooting.  He explained that the American quality is 
better than Russian, so the group decided to order tips from the 
U.S.  When asked how he chose ABF Inc., Volovod told us the 
company employs some Russians and they advertise in Russian on 
the internet.  Volovod does not know why "for use by the 
Commanding General personnel" was included on the license 
application.  He stated that ABF had completed the application 
and that probably they added this statement. 
 
¶3. Volovod says he is familiar with both Russian and U.S. 
regulations, including restrictions and re-export limitations. 
In the past he ordered 2-3 rifle scopes, which he uses himself. 
He personally uses 300-400 bullets per month.  He ordered 24,000 
because his friends also shoot and it is easier if one person 
places a large order.  Once they receive the order they will 
divide the bullets among themselves. 
 
¶4. We checked post records but found no information regarding 
the end-user.  Our FSN investigator did a short check with the 
local police and found no adverse information.
