FAREWELL TO BUSH" IN IRAN

Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam lead and all front pages highlight news of the 
U.N. Security Council's approval on December 16 of a resolution, 
"encouraging a final-status peace agreement between Israel and the 
Palestinians."  The papers quote chief Secretary Rice asserting that 
the establishment of the state of Palestine is long overdue and the 
occupation begun in 1967 should end.  Chief PLO negotiator Erekat is 
also quoted stating that resolution 1850 is the first to be adopted 
by the 15-member council in five years, as well as being the sole 
resolution specifically addressing the Middle East peace process. 
All papers note that Israel and the Palestinian Authority welcomed 
the resolution.  Coverage also includes excerpts from the Middle 
East Quartet statement expressing, "acute concern" over Israeli 
closures of Gaza crossings and a call for the extension of the 
Hamas-Israel truce. 
Al Hayat Al Jadida leads with December 16 statements by Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas on plans to hold elections in the West 
Bank and Gaza "very soon."  Abbas also called on Egypt and the U.S. 
to exert efforts to extend the Israel-Hamas truce and blamed Hamas 
for not having valid reasons to boycott intra-Palestinian talks. 
 
President Bush will meet with Palestinian Authority President Abbas 
at the White House on December 19, according to Al Hayat Al Jadida's 
and Al Ayyam's front pages.  Citing AFP, the papers note that the 
leaders will discuss joint peace efforts:  building viable 
Palestinian institutions, greater economic development and continued 
training of Palestinian security forces and their deployment in the 
West Bank.  In president-elect news, Al Quds reports on an inside 
page that former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Daniel Ayalon told 
Israeli daily The Jerusalem Post that president-elect Obama and his 
Secretary of State nominee Clinton might support a land swap deal 
between Israel and the Palestinians. 
In military news, Al Ayyam's front page highlights reports on 
Israeli air strikes in Gaza on December 16.  The paper reports that 
two Palestinian women and a journalist were injured and adds that 
Palestinian groups responded by firing projectiles into the Negev 
and on Sderot city in southern Israel.  In the West Bank, Al Ayyam 
reports on an inside page that Israeli military "stormed" Beit Umar 
village and Al Fawwar refugee camp near Hebron and arrested 16 
Palestinian youths, searched houses, and forced families to wait 
outside their homes for the duration of the nighttime raid. 
In settler news, Al Quds' and Al Ayyam's front pages report that 
Israeli police demolished, for the fourth time, a tent sheltering 
the Palestinian Al Kurd family who were evicted from their East 
Jerusalem house in accordance with an Israeli court order last 
month.  Previous coverage has noted that the tent stood just outside 
the family's former home which has been turned over to "Israeli 
settlers," and had become a focal point for protests against the 
eviction. 
Al Ayyam's and Al Hayat Al Jadida's front pages report on a London 
conference on investment in the Palestinian Territories held on 
December 16.  The conference yielded a decision to establish a $50 
million "bailout fund" for Palestinian companies and a joint forum 
for UK and Palestinian businessmen. 
 
Al Quds' front page and other dailies' inside pages, run the results 
of a recent poll jointly conducted by the Palestinian Center for 
Policy and Survey Research and the Israeli Truman Institute at 
Hebrew University.  The results show that 51% of Israelis and 74% of 
Palestinians support a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.  The poll 
also reveals that 48% of Palestinians would vote for Palestinian 
Authority Abbas and 37% of Israelis would vote for Likud party chair

BLOCK QUOTES: 
----------------------- 
 
1)  Al Quds' Khairy Mansur opines in Al Quds under the title, "The 
last minute war" (12/17):  "Many western Middle East experts have 
pointed to mounting evidence of a "military farewell" for the Bush 
administration, in the form of a [U.S.] military offensive against 
Iran..., that would constitute the second war, after Iraq, in which 
Tel Aviv will have led Washington by the nose, to accordance with 
its own agenda." 
 
2) Hani Al Hamada Farana writes in Al Ayyam under the title, 
"International condemnation of Israel" (12/17):  "Palestinians need 
to wage a legal battle based on international norms of legitimacy to 
force implementation of U.N. resolutions, and support such efforts 
with a non-violent, peaceful intifada, to win international 
solidarity to defeat the occupation and settlement expansion."
