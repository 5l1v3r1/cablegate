SUBJECT: SAO -- URGENT ASSISTANCE NEEDED IN RESOLVING VISA 
CASE FOR PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  Mission requires the Department's urgent 
assistant in securing a resolution for a Security Advisory 
Opinion (SAO) for a senior GOI official who hopes to travel 
to Pittsburgh for the upcoming G20 summit.  The applicant's 
position is the equivalent of a top presidential aide on the 
National Security Council and Joint Chiefs of Staff.  He is a 
former general in the Indonesian army.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) Mission requests the Department's urgent assistance in 
securing interagency SAO (Request ID: JAK0001GQD00) 
resolution for Mr. Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin (Indonesian passport 
number S161278 and DOB 30-October-1952) to travel to the 
United States on September 23 as part of a GOI Presidential 
delegation for the upcoming G20 Summit in Pittsburgh. 
Sjamsoeddin expects to finalize his travel on September 19. 
For this visit, Indonesian President Yudhoyono's office 
identified the visa applicant as a top aide.  Mission 
understands that Mr. Sjamsoeddin has an exact name and 
date-of-birth hit and is subject to the SAO.  If he can't be 
cleared for a visa, we need to provide an explanation to the 
GOI why this key aide can't go to the U.S. 
 
¶3. (U) Consular NIV Chief Kira Zaporski has already sent 
particulars of Sjamsoeddin by email in an expedite request to 
Greg Beer in CA/VO/L/C. We urgently need a reply within 24 
hours, before the opening of business on Friday, September 18 
Jakarta time. 
 
¶4. (U) As a key advisor to the Indonesian president, 
Sjamsoeddin's visit to the U.S. could offer an opportunity to 
focus discussion on concluding several ongoing Mission 
initiatives in Indonesia.  As we work towards finalizing 
details of the Comprehensive Partnership, it is important to 
facilitate the travel of such influential individuals.  We 
need the Department to bring Mr. Sjamsoeddin's pending SAO to 
a quick resolution.  If a visa cannot be issued, we should 
provide a clear explanation to the GoI, thereby offering 
Indonesia's leaders an opportunity to withdraw the visa 
request with minimal loss of face.
