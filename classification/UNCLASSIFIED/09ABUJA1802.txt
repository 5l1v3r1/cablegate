¶1. (SBU) PolCouns and PolOff met with Foreign Ministry (MFA) 
North and Central America Division Director Toyin Solaja 
September 28 to deliver the requested demarche on the Justice 
Goldstone report (Reftel).  We arranged this meeting with 
Solaja in lieu of MFA colleagues responsible for UN issues, 
given their earlier departure for Geneva and New York. 
Solaja provided no substantive response but promised to pass 
along U.S. views to his MFA colleagues for follow up. 
 
¶2. (U) We will report any further response that we receive.
