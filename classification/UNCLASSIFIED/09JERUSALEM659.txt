Al-Quds leads with and Al-Ayyam front pages news on plans for 
Fatah's sixth party conference, the first conference to be held in 
20 years.  The report quotes senior Fatah official Quray announcing 
that related documents are ready and the preparatory committee will 
meet next week to finalize details including the date and venue. 
The report further notes that Quray favors a venue in Egypt, while 
Fatah leader Abu Najjah announced that Egypt has declined acting as 
host, stating that a Palestinian Territory venue is preferable, 
according to coverage. 
 
Al-Quds front pages news citing AFP about the upcoming visit of 
Jordan's King Abdullah to the U.S. to meet with President Obama and 
senior officials on April 21.  According to coverage, the visit will 
be the first by an Arab leader since Obama took office and 
discussions will focus on bilateral relations, regional Middle East 
peace and the two-state solution for the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict.  According to Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, King Abdullah will call 
on the U.S. to exert more pressure on Israel to accept the Arab 
Peace Initiative and two-state solution.  King Abdullah will also 
convey Arab commitment to the Initiative and concerns of Arab 
parties including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and 
the Palestinian Authority over the future of the regional peace 
process under the Netanyahu Government.  According to April 12 
reporting in all dailies, the Arab parties' Foreign Ministers met on 
April 11 and drafted with the Secretary General of the Arab League, 
a two-page peace message in English to be delivered by Abdallah to 
Obama. 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with and Al-Quds front pages 
Palestinian Authority (PA) President Abbas' meeting with Saudi King 
Abdullah in Riyadh on April 12.  The meeting focused on the 
political situation in the Palestinian Territories and efforts 
towards regional peace and stability, reporting notes.  The two 
leaders expressed disappointment over Israeli rejection of the 
two-state solution and previously signed agreements.  The meeting 
was also attended by Palestinian Authority Premier Fayyad and the 
Saudi Foreign Minister, reporting concludes. 
 
All front pages report that Palestinian Authority President Abbas 
telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to congratulate him on 
Passover.  According to reports, Netanyahu expressed his readiness 
to "cooperate" on the peace process and negotiations with the 
Palestinians.  Abbas noted that the two parties must work together 
to move the peace process forward.  Coverage notes further that 
while a communiqu was released by Netanyahu's office describing the 
phone call as "positive," it did not make reference to any future 
meetings between the two leaders.  The communiqu also highlighted 
that Netanyahu reminded Abbas of the substantial history of 
cooperation between the Palestinian and Israeli leadership, 
including bilateral talks. 
 
All dailies run front page coverage of 50 Israeli settlers again 
"breaking into" the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on April 12.  The 
settlers, according to coverage, entered the compound without the 
usual Israeli police protection.  According to Palestinian 
officials, these continuous "violations' of the compound are 
"serious provocations" to Muslims, reporting notes. 
 
Al-Quds front pages and Al-Hayat and Al-Ayyam run inside coverage of 
Easter celebrations held in Jerusalem and Bethlehem despite, 
"intense Israeli restrictions."  In related news, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
 
JERUSALEM 00000659  002 OF 003 
 
 
cites a wire report about the Pope calling on Palestinians and 
Israelis to intensify peace efforts and end the conflict. 
 
In economic news, Al-Hayat Al Jadida's front page and an inside page 
of Al-Ayyam report that the Bank of Palestine is expanding to better 
serve the Palestinian public.  According to coverage, the Bank 
opened a new branch in Nablus city on April 12 during a ceremony 
attended by Palestinian Authority Minister of National Economy 
Hassunah and Palestinian Monetary Authority Governor Al-Wazir.

Weekend Stories

Sunday, April 12, 2009 
All dailies ran front page coverage of statements by the PLO 
Executive Committee that Palestinian unity talks should continue 
despite, "all the obstacles" and stressed the importance of Egypt 
continuing its role as sponsor of the talks.  Meanwhile, in a 
separate front page article, Al Quds reported that Hamas told press 
that Egypt has proposed the formation of an ad hoc committee to 
overcome the current impasse in talks.  Other "independent figures" 
announced that they were discussing ideas to bridge the gap between 
Hamas and Fatah regarding whether a future Palestinian government 
would "comply" or "respect" PLO agreements, reporting concluded. 
 
All front pages reported on a public demonstration against Jerusalem 
municipality demolitions of Palestinian homes.  The demonstration 
took place in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Al Bustan on April 
11 where "local groups" told press that continued demolitions could 
cause, "the situation in occupied Jerusalem and the Palestinian 
Territories to explode."  Local speakers also denounced the 
international community for limiting its reactions to statements of 
condemnations and stressed the need for serious steps to end the 
occupation.  Other locals called for a boycott of Israeli products. 
In separate reporting, Al Quds' front page noted concern over the 
Israeli Archeology Authority's plans for a "national project to 
preserve the stone-work of the Western Wall," a wall shared with the 
Al Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem.  Islamic Waqf Council Head 
Salhab noted that only the Waqf has authority to approve renovations 
since, the "Al Buraq Wall" is an integral part of the Al Aqsa 
mosque.

According to Al Ayyam's front page, "Obama asks for $800 million in 
financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority and for 
humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip."  Reporting noted that 
the sum is part of a $83.4 billion request to Congress that includes 
funding for "military efforts" in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 
Chief PLO negotiator Erekat confirmed that Palestinian Authority 
President Abbas has attached pre-conditions to any resumption of 
peace negotiations with Israel, namely Israeli Government acceptance 
of previous agreements and a freeze of settlement activities. 
Erekat highlighted that the Road Map Plan, "contains clear 
provisions regarding ending occupation and the establishment of a 
Palestinian state."  The coverage appeared on the front pages of Al 
Hayat Al Jadida and Al Ayyam. 
 
All front pages noted the injury of a pregnant Palestinian in 
Israeli "settler attacks in Hebron."  According to coverage, the 
attacks occurred near the Carmiel settlement that is, "built on 
lands confiscated east of Yatta village."  The injured included 
Palestinian farmers and shepherds, reports noted.  Papers also 
reported on 200 settlers from Bayt Ayn settlement north of Hebron

praying on the lands of the Palestinian Safa enclave in Bayt Ummar, 
an act viewed as "provocative" by Palestinian residents, papers 
reported.  Finally, papers reported on additional injuries in the 
weekly anti-separation barrier protests in the Palestinian villages 
of Al Masa'ra, Ni'lin, and Bil'in.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Omar Al-Ghul opines in official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida under 
the title, "how should we interpret Abbas' congratulating 
Netanyahu?"(04/13):  "Palestinian Authority President Abbas took the 
initiative and congratulated Prime Minister Netanyahu on forming the 
Government and Passover, an act that was nothing more than a 
courteous gesture... The call should not be given more importance 
than it deserves, as some politicians are trying to do, especially 
since the two leaders did not agree on a time to meet nor has the 
Palestinian official position on negotiations with Israel 
changed... Perhaps it would change if the Israeli Government  would 
revisit its policies.  Only then could negotiations be 
re-launched." 
 
2) Regular columnist Adil Malik opines in Al-Quds independent daily 
under the title, "How would Iran react to U.S. openness to 
dialogue?"(04/13):  "Obama seemed very confident when he expressed 
U.S. openness to dialogue with Iran and when he expressed his 
willingness to use all means necessary to reach an understanding 
with Iran regarding its nuclear program... This is probably the 
first time that Iran has welcomed such an offer... Iran will be 
making a mistake if it lets this opportunity go by, especially since 
the U.S. perceives of Iran as crucial to containing U.S. losses in 
Iraq and Afghanistan."
