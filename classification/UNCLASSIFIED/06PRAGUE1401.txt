The Ambassador delivered reftel A demarche to the Minister of 
Finance on November 1 and to the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
on November 3, and both Ministers replied they would consider 
it, as reported in reftels C & D.  The Ministry of Finance 
office handling this issue explained that while the GOCR had 
already agreed to forgive 80% of Iraq's sovereign external 
debt to the Czech Republic, it was not/not inclined to 
forgive the remaining 20% because the debt is military in 
nature and the GOCR does not wish to set a precedent in 
forgiving military debt.
