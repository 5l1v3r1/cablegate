¶1.  This message contains an action request at paragraph 4. 
 
¶2.  On August 30, Pol-Econ Counselor discussed reftel request 
with Ken Hopper, Infrastructure Advisor in the Ministry of 
Transportation.  Hopper said that New Zealand would need to 
see our request in a diplomatic note in order to consider 
formally our proposal to remove the Computer Reservation 
Systems (CRS) from the Multilateral Agreement on the 
Liberalization of International Air Transport (MALIAT). PE 
Counselor told Hopper that we were making similar inquiries 
with MALIAT partners Brunei, Chile, Samoa, Singapore and 
Tonga (via our mission in Suva).  He replied that as New 
Zealand is the repository for the MALIAT, GNZ would also 
share any dip note we sent to Wellington with the other 
signatories as well. 
 
¶3.  Hopper said that while he obviously can't speak 
officially for GNZ at this stage, he predicts that New 
Zealand will have no problem with our request. 
 
¶4.  Post requests that Washington provide language for a 
diplomatic note if and when you would like us to submit a 
formal request to GNZ on this issue.
