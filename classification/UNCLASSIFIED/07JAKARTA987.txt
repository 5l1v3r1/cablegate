REF: STATE 40909 
 
¶1. We delivered reftel text as a nonpaper to the Indonesian 
Department of Foreign Affairs on April 5.  We discussed the 
paper on the margins of a meeting with Yonatri Rilmania, who 
is responsible for financial sanctions in the Directorate for 
International Security and Disarmament.  We urged that the 
Indonesian government review its trade with Iran with an eye 
to complying with UNSCR 1737. 
 
¶2. Rilmania had no immediate comment but said he would convey 
our concerns and the nonpaper to the cognizant officer, 
Ramadansyah Hasan, who was unavailable at the time.  We will 
report any official response from the Indonesian government.
