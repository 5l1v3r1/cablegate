SUBJECT: VENEZUELA: UPDATE OF WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR 
 
REF: 2005 CARACAS 002499 
 
¶1. Venezuelan law protects children from exploitation in the 
workplace, but enforcement is often lacking.  The Ministry of 
Labor and the National Institute for Minors enforces child 
labor policies effectively in the formal sector, but less so 
in the informal sector.  According to official Ministry of 
Labor statistics, 45 percent of all Venezuelan employees 
worked in the informal sector in October 2006.  Among minors 
in the workplace, the percentage that are employed in the 
informal sector is considerbly higher -- almost 70 percent, 
according to the Foundation for the Training in the 
Investigation of Human Resources. 
 
¶2. The law permits children between the ages of 12 and 14 to 
work only if the National Institute for Minors or the 
Ministry of Labor grants special permission; children between 
the ages of 14 and 16 may not work without the permission of 
their legal guardians.  Those under 16 years of age may by 
law work no more than 6 hours per day or 30 hours per week. 
Minors under the age of 18 may work only between 6:00 a.m. 
and 7:00 p.m. 
 
¶3. Minors may not work in mines or smelting factories.  They 
are also prohibited by law from working in occupations that 
risk life or health or could damage intellectual or moral 
development; or in public spectacles.  The Venezuelan 
government decreed two increases in the minimum wage for 
adolescent workers and apprentices in 2006, raising the wage 
to 384,225 Bolivares a month (one dollar = 2150 Bolivares). 
 
¶4. Centro Comunitario de Aprendizaje y Por los Derechos de la 
Ninez y Adolescencia (CECODAP), a leading Venezuelan NGO 
promoting the rights of children and adolescents, recently 
issued an annual report documenting the plight of many 
children in the workplace.  Citing a Ministry of Labor study, 
CECODAP notes that there are approximately one million minors 
working in Venezuela of which a large percentage do not 
receive the benefits due to them under Venezuelan law. 
CEPODAP estimates, based on the same Labor Ministry study, 
that: 
 
-- 72 percent of children and adolescents working do not have 
the proper work permits; 
-- 59.5 percent work more than 6 hours a day and 30 hours a 
week; 
-- 27 percent receive a one-hour break; 
-- less than 4 percent have a work contract 
-- only 2 percent are registered with the social security 
system; 
-- one percent receive paid vacations 
-- less than one percent earn the minimum wage. 
 
¶5. Venezuela is a source, transit, and destination country 
for women and children trafficked for the purposes of sexual 
exploitation and forced labor.  The law prohibits inducing 
the prostitution and corruption of minors, but here too 
enforcement is lacking.  Laws against child trafficking 
provide for fines of one to 10 months' salary.  Penalties for 
the prostitution or corruption of minors range from 3 to 18 
months in prison and up to 4 years in prison if the minor is 
younger than 12 years old.  The Venezuelan government does 
not fully comply with the minimum standards for the 
elimination of trafficking.
