SUBJECT:ISRAELI POLLSTER PROVIDES INTERESTING DATA 
 
¶1.  During a November 20 meeting with the PAO, pollster Jacob Shamir 
of Hebrew University provided some interesting data: 
 
- Only 25% of Israelis support reoccupying Gaza.  41% support ad hoc 
operations in Gaza and 27% support using diplomatic means. 
 
- When Israelis are asked about Israeli conventional wisdom on 
talking with Hamas, a large majority (no figure provided) believe 
that other Israelis are against it.  When questioned how they feel 
personally about talking to Hamas, 56% are in favor. 
 
- An overwhelming majority (no figure provided) of Israelis support 
negotiating with Hamas over Gilad Shalit's release. 
 
- 25% of Israelis support returning the Golan Heights to Syria 
 
- A large number of Israelis and Palestinians (no figure provided) 
support the Clinton parameters for a peace agreement. 
 
¶2.  The conversation took place the same day that Israeli newspapers 
were carrying front page stories about Netanyahu's large lead in the 
polls.  Shamir felt that the lead will not hold because the campaign 
has not really begun and because Israelis are likely to blame the 
financial reforms that Netanyahu implemented during his previous 
time as Prime Minister for the growing Israeli financial crisis. 
 
¶3.  Comment:  Israel is a heavily polled society but Shamir always 
offers new ways of looking at the data.  He is also the only Israeli 
pollster working with a partner on the West Bank.  They are 
currently polling on views of the new administration and how it 
should approach the peace process.  Shamir has offered to share that 
data when it becomes available. MORENO
