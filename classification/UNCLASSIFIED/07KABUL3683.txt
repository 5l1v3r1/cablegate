SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH FEMALE MPS TO SIGNAL 
CONTINUED SUPPORT 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Ambassador met with seven female members of 
parliament on October 18.  The MPs, mostly Pashtuns from 
southern provinces, were generally not aligned politically. 
They said that they lacked computers, offices, and security 
support.  But, their provincial connections are better than 
those of their male counterparts because their constituents 
trust them.  They observed that powerful politicians in the 
parliament have resources, but offer them only to political 
allies.  They predicted women would vote their own minds in 
the 2009 presidential election. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador encouraged the group to organize and 
develop connections to other MPs with complementary agendas. 
The Ambassador promised the MPs the USG's continued support.
