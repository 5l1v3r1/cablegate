SUBJECT: THE COSTA RICAN ECONOMY IMPROVES DURING 2006 
 
REF: SAN JOSE 213 
 
¶1.  Banco Central de Costa Rica (BCCR) says the country's GDP grew 
over 7% in 2006.  This is the highest GDP growth rate since 8% in 
¶1999.  Inflation for 2006 was 9.4%, 5 percentage points lower than 
last year's rate of 14.4%, and the lowest rate in 14 years.  While 
foreign direct investment flows reached a record $1.4 billion, 
surprisingly, the tourism industry reports a disturbing trend of 
apparent stagnation. 
 
¶2.  Tourism during 2006 grew by a surprisingly meager 1.8% (See 
Reftel).  Tourism Minister, Carlos Benevides, explained to local 
media that Costa Rica is a 'mature product' attracting a different 
type of buyer.  In contrast, other key sectors such as agriculture 
and free zone manufacturing showed marked improvement.  In 2006 FDI 
flows doubled from the $861 million level registered in 2005. 
According to Minister Benevides, real estate investment for tourism 
development along the Pacific coasts of Guanacaste and Puntarenas 
accounted for the large increase. 
 
¶3.  While the BCCR's foreign currency reserves stood at more than 
$3.1 billion at year's end, Jorge Madrigal, BCCR Economic Director, 
announced that total reserves including those of the commercial 
banks reached $3.88 billion, equal to 14% of GDP.  This represents 
an increase of $966 million during 2006.  In addition to the good 
news of the doubling of FDI, Madrigal indicated that the central 
bank's monetary policy was responsible for lowering devaluation of 
the Colon from 8.2% in 2005 to 4.4% for 2006.
