To Mr. Colonel Kevin P. Karol

Subject: Brazilian Military Aircraft Operation in the U.S. 
 
Dear Attache, 
 
In response to Official Letter No.U-1073/05 dated April 11, 
2005, from your attach office, I bring to your attention 
that the Operational Command of the squad to which the 
violating aircraft belonged took a number of steps aimed at 
preventing similar events from happening in the future. 
 
Among the steps taken, that particular Command held a 
meeting with all of the Air Force Unit Commanders bringing 
the event to their attention and instructing that all of the 
pilots should be made aware of it.  The International Air 
Traffic Section, which is responsible for the retraining and 
development of pilots who fly international missions, was 
also instructed to emphasize the proper procedures.  In 
terms of the pilot, he will only be allowed to participate 
in international missions after going through retraining in 
the International Air Traffic Course. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Brigadier General Miguel Marcio Duarte Martins 
Head of International Affairs Division, Air Force Chief of 
Staff
