On the Political and Social Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Multiple local news outlets reported this week that the six 
party negotiators have agreed on 15 of 21 contentious issues that 
one or more of the parties believe are undermining the inclusive 
government. Resolved issues apparently include unspecified media 
reforms, "pirate" radio stations such as VOA that are broadcast into 
Zimbabwe, and a land audit. Remaining unresolved issues include the 
appointments of Reserve Bank Governor Gideon Gono and Attorney 
General Johannes Tomana, the refusal to swear in Roy Bennett as 
Deputy Minister of Agriculture, and the division of governorships. 
These issues are likely to be referred to the three principals, 
Mugabe, Tsvangirai, and Mutambara, though the negotiators intend on 
meeting throughout the upcoming weekend. 
 
¶3.  ZANU-PF concluded its five-year Congress on December 12 by 
reelecting President Robert Mugabe to another term, as well as 
completing the appointments of Joice Mujuru and John Nkomo as Vice 
Presidents, and Simon Khaya Moyo as Party Chairman. Though rumors 
abounded, no challenges arose from the estimated 5,000 delegates 
attending the Harare-based event. The party attempted to use the 
Congress to quell party discontent, while blaming western sanctions 
and the MDC for ZANU-PF's poor performance in the 2008 elections. 
Several published resolutions sought to encourage President Jacob 
Zuma's South African facilitation team to adopt a more patient and 
ZANU-PF friendly approach. Mugabe also raised the possibility of 
holding elections earlier than anticipated and warned the MDC not to 
interfere with the security forces. See Harare 976. 
 
¶4.  Controversial politician Jonathan Moyo completed his 
phoenix-like return to the good graces of ZANU-PF by being elected 
into the party's Central Committee at the recently-concluded 
Congress, and may soon land a position in the party's top echelon, 
the politburo. Moyo won his Tsholotsho seat running as an 
independent in 2008, though some of his constituents will no doubt 
be surprised to find they are now residents of a ZANU-PF 
constituency. Moyo had been banished from the party through his 
involvement in the failed Tsholotsho incident in 2004 where he was 
central in efforts to elevate Emmerson Mnangagwa's succession 
prospects. 
 
¶5.  December 17, two correspondents of VOA Studio 7 for Zimbabwe -- 
Godwin Mangudya and Frank Chikowore -- and two other freelance 
QGodwin Mangudya and Frank Chikowore -- and two other freelance 
journalists launched a court application seeking to nullify results 
of a recent election held by the Zimbabwe Union of Journalists. The 
election, whose venue was kept secret to most journalists until the 
day of the election, elevated Dumisani Sibanda, the news editor of 
the government-controlled weekly, The Sunday News, to President, and 
former President Mathew Takaona to a consultant position. Mangudya, 
who planned to throw his hat in the ring, is seeking an order to 
void the election on grounds that the process was biased.

¶6.  Mugabe and his 59-member delegation left this week to attend the 
Copenhagen climate change summit where he attacked the West for 
environmental hypocrisy. The group took an Air Zimbabwe plane, 
leaving passengers planning to travel to London to fend for 
themselves. PM Tsvangirai had planned on attending the summit with 
his own 19-member delegation, but pulled out at the last minute. 
Mugabe's group includes his wife Grace who enjoys her overseas 
shopping opportunities and once famously said in response to a 
question on her expensive footwear, "I have very narrow feet so I 
only wear Ferragamo." 
 
----------------------------------- 
On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  The Herald reports that the Senate has deferred debate on 
amendments to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe law. The paper says 
ZANU-PF senators want to make changes to the bill. Finance Minister 
Biti has also told us he fears the legislation is stalled for now. 
See Harare 987. 
¶8.  On the road recently with USAID consultants, we saw that rural 
food markets are still creaky despite the abolition of the Grain 
Marketing Board's monopoly. Remote rural markets are not integrated 
due to poor road and telecommunications infrastructure, which makes 
them largely inaccessible. A village with food surplus may co-exist 
next to another village that has a food deficit. So for now it seems 
food aid to deficit areas need not have a negative effect on 
production in the food surplus areas. Better communication 
infrastructure -- for instance, roads and cell-phone towers -- would 
be a good way to get markets working, if only the GOZ had the money. 
 
 
¶9.  Australia announced it was donating US$4.4 million to Zimbabwe 
through the Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund -- an Africa-wide 
initiative led by the UK and the Netherlands -- to boost Zimbabwe's 
rural economy by establishing seed distribution businesses and 
enable small loans to farmers. The assistance marks an effort by 
Australia to move beyond short-term relief to Zimbabwe. 
 
¶10.  According to the Tobacco Industry Marketing Board (TIMB), 
small-scale tobacco growers have started drawing on a US$2.3 million 
facility offered by the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe to purchase 
fertilizers and chemicals. The facility is scheduled to assist 3,500 
tobacco farmers. The TIMB identifies the main problem as being the 
slow pace at which fertilizer companies push their product onto the 
market. Outgrower schemes set up by tobacco companies deliver inputs 
to at least three times as many farmers, and they have had more 
success than the TIMB at procuring fertilizer. 
 
¶11.  Once the country's largest producer of nickel, BNC suspended 
operations more than a year ago. But now the mine is set to re-open 
following an upturn in nickel prices and stability in the local 
economy. Bindura's parent company, Mwana Africa, said in a statement 
accompanying its half-year results that operations can be restarted 
Qaccompanying its half-year results that operations can be restarted 
with very limited capital expenditure.

Quote of the Week

¶12.  "The elections are not very far off, the inclusive government 
was given a short life, 18 months, 24 months, and so the remaining 
part of its life is very short." 
-- An excerpt from President Robert Mugabe's closing remarks at the 
ZANU-PF Congress on December 12.
