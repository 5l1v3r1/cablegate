SUBJECT: AMAWI BUILDING RENOVATION PROJECT 
 
¶1.  With the approval and signature of the leases for the Amawi 
building and primary setback property, post would like to pursue the 
immediate renovation and upgrade of this annex to allow for 
occupancy of the facility as soon as possible in FY 2010.  Post 
reiterates its request that it be authorized to manage and contract 
directly for all renovations and security upgrades required.  The 
USG will have full access to the facility as of September 1, 2009, 
for the renovation program to begin -- and post believes that it has 
the on-the-ground capacity to start now with the design 
requirements. 
 
¶2.  The current OBO/PDCS program estimates for the renovations 
assumed an OBO-managed, RPSO-contracted project totaling over $11 
million.  Post is certain that it has the talent and expertise to 
develop a post-managed make-ready and fit-out plan to address the 
security, operational, and other requirements of the building. 
Based on OBO/PDCS estimates, allowing post to manage this renovation 
and to award separate contracts for each piece of the renovation 
will reduce this $11 million figure by at least half, to 
approximately $5 million.  This is a more reasonable renovation cost 
for a lease with options that total 24 years in the length.  Post 
successfully completed make-readies of the Lazarist Monastery 
facility in 2006 and the GSO Annex in 2008 -- both in less than 
twelve months, using local vendors -- and believes that it can do 
this again within a more reasonable time frame than currently 
projected. 
 
¶3.  USAID's West Bank and Gaza mission is one of the largest USAID 
missions in the world, with approximately $1.2 billion in FY 2008 
and FY 2009 funding.  A presence in the Amawi building will give the 
USAID mission, one of the primary future occupants of the facility, 
the necessary capacity to program this funding.  OBO's current 
timeline of two years-plus to renovate the Amawi facility is simply 
unacceptable, given the Congressional mandate for USAID. 
 
¶4.  In addition, post's overall facility space requirements are 
under constant pressure.  Growth in Mission Jerusalem -- to 
incorporate Special Envoy Mitchell's staff, new USSC positions, as 
well as other traditional post growth in the program and management 
areas -- requires increased space.  Post had counted on having this 
space available in FY 2010 by moving into the Amawi building. 
 
¶5.  Post cannot afford to have the Amawi renovation project extend 
beyond FY 2010, and strongly encourages OBO to authorize that all 
renovations and security upgrades be post-managed.
