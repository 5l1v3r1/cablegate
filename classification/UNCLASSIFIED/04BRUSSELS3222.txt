REF: A. STATE 162903 
     ¶B. THE HAGUE 1901 
 
¶1. (SBU) We reviewed ref A points during a July 28 meeting 
with Baltasar Benz, the Afghanistan desk officer in the 
Commission's External Relations directorate.  Benz said that 
the Commission -- which had been concerned about 
Afghanistan's warlords -- welcomed President Karzai's 
decision to drop Fahim Kahn as his running mate.  The 
Commission (and the EU more generally) will maintain its 
long-standing support for Afghan stability, a public focus 
since the Bonn Conference and highlighted most recently in 
the Dutch EU Presidency's July 27 statement (ref B).  Benz 
remarked on the close cooperation between the U.S. and the 
Commission, EU special representative, core EU member states, 
and G-8 countries on Afghan issues. 
 
¶2. (U) Also on July 28, CFSP High Representative Solana's 
office issued a press release detailing his discussion with 
Karzai earlier in the day.  Solana said that the EU supported 
Karzai's choice of running mates, described in the press 
release as "persons of high standing and integrity as well as 
committed to the process of reform."  Solana hailed the 
Afghan people's interest in participating in the elections -- 
as shown by the high percentage of registered voters and the 
diversity of presidential candidates -- and called for a 
secure and open campaign process. 
 
¶3. (U) The Commission on July 29 approved an additional 9 
million euros for the UN-managed Elections Project, which 
will provide support for election-related activities in 
Afghanistan including voter information campaigns and 
ensuring that all candidates have media access.
