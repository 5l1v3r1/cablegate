SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - LEBANON 
 
¶1.  This Travel Warning updates information on security 
threats and ongoing political tensions in Lebanon, and 
informs U.S. citizens of current safety and security 
concerns.  The Department of State continues to strongly 
urge that Americans defer travel to Lebanon and that 
American citizens in Lebanon consider carefully the risks 
of remaining.  This Travel Warning supersedes the Travel 
Warning for Lebanon issued on October 17, 2007. 
 
¶2.  The U.S. remains concerned about the threat of 
terrorist attacks against Western and Lebanese government 
interests in Lebanon.  Groups such as Al-Qaeda and Jund 
al-Sham are present in Lebanon, and they have issued 
statements calling for attacks against Western interests. 
The Department of State is also concerned that the clashes 
between terrorist extremists and the Lebanese Armed Forces 
that occurred in the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp in 
northern Lebanon from May to September 2007 could occur in 
other camps in Lebanon.  U.S. citizens who visit refugee 
camps in Lebanon risk becoming trapped during hostilities. 
 
¶3.  There have been several assassinations of military and 
political figures in Lebanon within the past year.  On 
December 12, 2007, a senior member of the Lebanese Armed 
Forces was killed by a car bomb; a Lebanese Internal 
Security Force officer was killed in a similar fashion on 
January 25, 2008.  Two anti-Syria Members of Parliament 
were assassinated in separate car bombings in Beirut in 
June and September 2007.  On January 15, 2008, an Embassy 
vehicle was damaged and two Embassy employees were injured 
in yet another bombing.  In each of these incidents 
innocent bystanders have been injured or killed. 
 
¶4.  On June 7, 2007, a bomb exploded in the town of Zouk 
Mousbeh, north of Beirut.  This followed the discovery of 
explosive-laden vehicles in Eastern Lebanon.  Since May 20 
2007, explosions have occurred in the Beirut neighborhoods 
of Achrafieh and Verdun, the Beirut suburb of Sad Al- 
Bouchrieh, and the resort town of Aley. 
 
¶5.  The terrorist group Hizballah has threatened 
retaliatory actions for the assassination of Hizballah 
official Imad Fayez Mugniyah, who was killed in Syria by 
unknown assailants on February 12, 2008.  Prominent 
members of Hizballah have intimated that they hold the 
United States partially responsible for Mugniyah's death, 
and it is possible that someone may lash out against U.S. 
interests or persons. 
 
¶6.  Landmines and unexploded ordnance pose significant 
dangers throughout southern Lebanon, particularly south of 
the Litani River, as well as in areas of Lebanon where 
civil war fighting was intense.  More than a dozen 
civilians have been killed and over 100 injured by 
unexploded ordnance following the armed conflict in July- 
August 2006.  Travelers should watch for posted landmine 
warnings and strictly avoid all areas where landmines and 
unexploded ordnance may be present. 
 
¶7.  The Department of State strongly urges U.S. citizens 
to defer travel to Lebanon, and urges U.S. citizens 
already in Lebanon to carefully consider the risks of 
remaining.  U.S. citizens who choose to remain in Lebanon 
are encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance; 
confirm and maintain the validity of their passports and 
other U.S. travel documents for themselves and their 
family members; monitor the local security situation and 
be ready to depart quickly in the event of any 
deterioration in the situation. 
 
 
STATE 00041693  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶8.  U.S. citizens traveling to Lebanon or resident in 
Lebanon should be aware the U.S. Embassy has limited 
ability to reach all areas of Lebanon.  The Embassy cannot 
guarantee that Embassy employees can render assistance to 
U.S. citizens in areas where there is limited government 
control, such as the southern part of Lebanon where 
Hizballah continues to be active. 
 
¶9.  In a crisis situation, U.S. citizens are responsible 
for arranging commercial or private means of 
transportation to depart Lebanon.  If evacuation is 
warranted, only when all other transportation options are 
unavailable will the U.S. Government assist U.S. citizens 
in leaving a country.  This service will be provided on a 
cost-recovery basis, which means the traveler must 
reimburse the U.S. government for the cost of the travel. 
The lack of valid travel documents will slow the U.S. 
Embassy's ability to provide assistance.  Further 
information on the department's role during emergencies is 
provided at 
http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/tips/emerg encies/emerge 
ncies_1212.html. 
 
¶10.  The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. 
government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to 
require them to live and work under strict security 
restrictions. These practices limit, and may occasionally 
prevent, access by U.S. Embassy officials to certain areas 
of the country.  Unofficial travel to Lebanon by U.S. 
government employees and their family members requires 
prior approval by the Department of State. 
 
¶11.  The Embassy is located in Awkar, near Antelias, 
Beirut, Lebanon.  Public access hours for American 
citizens are Monday through Thursday, 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 
a.m.; however, American citizens who require emergency 
services outside of these hours may contact the embassy by 
telephone at any time. The telephone numbers are (961-4) 
542-600, 543-600, and fax 544-209. American citizens may 
register with the embassy online by 
visiting https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs. 
Information on consular services and registration can also 
be found at http://lebanon.usembassy.gov or by phone at 
the above telephone numbers between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 
p.m., Monday through Friday local time. 
 
¶12.  Updated information on travel and security in Lebanon 
may be obtained from the Department of State by calling 1- 
888-407-4747 within the United States and Canada or, from 
overseas, 1-202-501-4444.  Additional details can be found 
in the Department of State's Country Specific Information 
for Lebanon, and the Worldwide Caution, which are 
available on the Department's Internet website at 
http://travel.state.gov. 
 
¶13.  Minimize considered.
