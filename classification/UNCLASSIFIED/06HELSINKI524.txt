Â¶1. PolChief delivered subject demarche to Laura 
Kansikas-Debraise, MFA Office Director for Arms Control and 
Non-proliferation, on June 8.  Kansikas-Debraise agreed 
generally with our points and said she would support starting 
FMCT negotiations in Geneva as soon as possible.  She added 
that starting negotiations in no way pre-judges their 
outcome, but she fully agreed that the proper venue to 
resolve differences regarding aspects of FMCT is through 
negotiations at the CD.
