1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) attempted 
to conduct a post shipment-verification (PSV) at Centre Bright 
Company, Unit 7A, Nathan Commercial building, 430-436 Nathan Road, 
Kowloon, Hong Kong (Centre Bright). The items in question for this 
check are Xilinx integrated circuits exported to Centre Bright by GE 
Procurement LLC on or about March 4, 2005. These items are 
classified under export control classification number (ECCN) 
3A001a2c and, if properly classified, would be controlled for 
national security (NS) reasons.  This ECCN is one of the class of 
products that may be exported to Hong Kong license free but would 
require a license if shipped directly to mainland China. 
 
¶3.  As further detailed in reftels B-C, Centre Bright was the 
subject of a prior unfavorable PSV and is related (directly or 
indirectly) to several additional unfavorable PSVs involving at 
least the following Hong Kong companies: Exodus Microelectronics, 
Echelon Microsystems Limited and Victory Wave Holding Ltd.  These 
companies are, in turn, related or conduct business with a range of 
problematic mainland China companies.  Based on information received 
from an industry source, ECO believes that the directors and 
shareholders of Exodus, Centre Bright, Victory Wave and Echelon are 
all members of the same family (parents and adult son).  A review of 
the Hong Kong Companies Registry reveals that the corporate 
information concerning Centre Bright has not changed since the date 
of the Centre Bright PSV referenced in reftel B. 
 
¶4.  FCS Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan attempted, on several 
occasions, to set up a meeting with representatives of Centre Bright 
at a range of contact numbers (including those provided by OEA). 
ECO subsequently sent a registered letter requesting a meeting to 
Centre Bright at a new address, namely Room D, Block 1, 6/F, 
International Industrial Ctr, 2-8 Kwai Tei Street, Shatin, New 
Territories, Hong Kong (the new registered address of the company). 
The Hong Kong Post Office confirms that a representative of Centre 
Bright signed for the letter.  When Ms. Chan attempted to set up the 
meeting, however, the party answering the phone at Centre Bright 
stated that the applicable person was either not available or that 
they would return the call.  To date, Commercial Assistant Chan has 
not been able to schedule the check and ECO believes further 
attempts will prove unsuccessful. 
 
¶5. Based on the information noted above, ECO believes that Centre 
Bright is a most unsuitable recipient of U.S. origin controlled 
technology.  Further, ECO recommends that Centre Bright be added to 
the BIS Entities List or that the BIS Unverified List be amended to 
reflect an additional address for Centre Bright (which is already on 
the BIS Unverified List).
