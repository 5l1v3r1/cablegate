¶1. With respect to information requested reftel: The 
Canadian federal government contact is Paul Pagotto at 
Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada 
(PSEPC). He has agreed to be the Canadian government 
point of contact for this effort.  In addition, you 
will also find the contact details of Carl Yates, the 
Chairman of the private sector and municipal effort to 
address water sector CIP being managed under the 
auspices of the Canadian Water & Waste Water 
Association (CWWA) which is the Canadian equivalent to 
the American Water Works Association (AWWA).

¶2. No one at Environment Canada (including the Director 
of Canada-U.S. relations there) returned Embassy calls 
regarding this issue. We have concluded that 
Environment Canada is not a key player in this domain, 
and that PSEPC, the provinces, municipalities and water 
utility companies have the lead in protecting water and 
waste water infrastructure.
