Polchief provided reftel A points by non-paper November 3 to 
Friedrich Stift, MFA Middle East Director, and discussed the 
issue with Stift November 4.  Stift said the GOA shares USG 
concerns about elements of the Goldstone Report and about the 
likely content of a resolution that would be introduced in 
the UNGA.  Without getting into possible textual elements, 
Stift said Austria, along with most or all other EU members, 
would likely abstain on a resolution introduced at the UNGA 
November 4 by the Arab Group and others.  He said the GOA 
continues to believe the Goldstone Report should be addressed 
at the Human Rights Council and not the UNSC.  Stift said he 
had conveyed the USG position to Austrian officials in New 
York.
