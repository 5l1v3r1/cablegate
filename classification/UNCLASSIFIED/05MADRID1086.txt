ESTHOFF discussed Ref A demarche March 17 with French DCM 
Jean Marc Rives and March 18 with French POLCOUNS Antoine de 
Sury.  Rives referred to our earlier approach to MFA last 
September (Ref B), noting that when he and ESTHOFF had 
hand-delivered the points to the MFA, our GOS interlocutor 
had merely thanked us for the information and agreed to pass 
it to other interested ministries.  As a result, and given 
that the U.S. had allowed France to determine demarche 
modalities, Rives said he had instructed de Sary to make the 
points over the phone to MFA and to call ESTHOFF in the event 
of a substantive MFA reaction.  ESTHOFF confirmed this 
arrangement in an early morning March 18 telephone 
conversation with de Sury.  De Sury called ESTHOFF back later 
March 18 to report that France's MFA interlocutor, acting MFA 
Disarmament Deputy Director Jose Ramon Garcia Rodriguez, had 
no substantive reaction.
