Lockheed Martin Gets Contract to Upgrade Turkey's F-16s 
Hurriyet, Zaman, Cumhuriyet, Sabah and others:  Lockheed Martin, the 
world's largest defense company, announced Tuesday that it has won 
an $800 million contract to upgrade Turkey's fleet of F-16 fighter 
jets.  In a written statement Lockheed Martin said that the company 
will provide 216 modernization kits to upgrade Turkish F-16C and D 
model aircrafts in the Turkish Air Force inventory.  This contract 
is the continuation of the initial contract signed in April 2005 
between the governments of Turkey and the US.  Sabah underlines that 
the US Special envoy for countering PKK terrorism Joseph Ralston is 
member of Lockheed Martin's Board of Director. 
 
Preventive Measures Package from the Interior Ministry for Honor 
Killings 
Zaman reports that the Interior Ministry launched an initiative to 
prevent honor killings and domestic violence.  A circular under the 
signature of Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu, already sent to the 
governors of all provinces, stating that every province should 
establish a committee headed by the governor.  This committee should 
establish a special fund to meet the victims' needs.  Moreover, the 
municipalities should open up shelters for women and children. The 
committees are also directed to ensure security units dealing with 
the honor killings should definitely be trained by the academicians 
and intellectuals. 
 
FM Gul:  Turkey Reserves the Right to Conduct Cross-Border 
Operations to Iraq 
Milliyet, Sabah, Yeni Safak and others:  Responding to a question 
from CHP deputy Erdal Karademir, FM Gul said Turkey had signed no 
memorandum of understanding in 2003 with the then US Secretary of 
State Colin Powell.  Talks with Powell had focused on possible 
developments after the US intervention in Iraq, but, Turkey never 
signed any document saying that Turkey would abstain from 
cross-border operations into Iraq or would ask the US permission for 
security operations. Gul also denied the allegations that Turkish 
operations against the PKK were monitored by US observers to control 
possible abuse of force during the operations. 
 
Editorial Opinion: Saddam's Verdict 
Derya Sazak comments in the mainstream Milliyet that Saddam should 
be held accountable for his crimes, but the perpetrators of current 
crimes should be accountable too: "Iraq is going through the most 
terrible period of its history as the civil war costs hundreds of 
lives every day.  Given the current situation in Iraq, the murder of 
148 Shiites in 1982 has become like a routine daily event.  Saddam 
was held accountable for his crimes during the dictatorship period. 
How about those who make up the rest of the picture in the 
post-Saddam period?  Will they also be held accountable for their 
crimes in the name of bringing democracy to Iraq?  Let's remember 
that the Bush administration has started pondering the ways of 
exiting Iraq since the civil war creates an impossible situation. 
The Baker report might be a chance in this regard.  Today even the 
US media is mocking Bush and Cheney about their failure in Iraq.  Is 
there another way of defining the current situation besides a crime 
against humanity?" 
 
Hakan Celik argues in the tabloid Posta that the execution of Saddam 
will incite even more violence:  "Talabani is under pressure from 
Kurds to approve the death verdict.  Some Shiite groups are also 
demanding the execution of the death sentence immediately. 
Talabani's hesitation is not a surprise because he knows the people 
of Iraq well.  By looking at the bigger picture, he realizes the 
serious consequences that would result from the hanging of Saddam. 
It is certain that Talabani will try everything to not be a part of 
this decision.  The death of Saddam will not bring any solution to 
Iraq's problems moreover it will only help to make it worse.  Iraq 
is currently going through economic poverty and serious instability. 
 The main reason for Iraq's occupation was the alleged link between 
 
ANKARA 00006762  002 OF 002 
 
 
Al Qaeda and Saddam which was never proved.  Even though the 
official US policy line is about the territorial integrity of Iraq, 
there is a de facto division of Iraq.  Given the current situation, 
the execution of the death sentence will incite hatred between 
Sunnis and Shiites even more.  Saddam should suffer with a life 
sentence but should not be hanged." 
 
Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Namik Tan Comments on the so-called 
Armenian Genocide Issue 
All papers:  At his final press briefing before taking up his 
assignment as Ambassador to Israel, MFA spokesperson Namik Tan 
called on the US Administration to act with common sense against 
increasing prospects for adoption of an Armenian genocide resolution 
by US Congress now controlled by Democrats.  Tan expressed Ankara's 
displeasure at the Armenian diaspora's efforts to take advantage of 
recent political developments in the US and have their genocide 
claims recognized in Congress. 
 
Sanliurfa Villagers Acquitted for Throwing Eggs at US Soldiers 
Star, Aksam and others:  The Sanliurfa Penal Court acquitted 
Sanliurfa villagers for throwing eggs at US soldiers during their 
visit to the village in 2003 to collect an unexploded missile that 
accidentally landed in the village.
