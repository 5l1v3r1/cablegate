SUBJECT: AHD AL-IRAQ TO PRESENT DRAFT LEGISLATION IN NEXT COR 
SESSION 
 
1.(U) Ahd al-Iraq Director Dr. Azhar Al-Sheikhly met with Poloff on 
August 30 to discuss the draft legislation her organization prepared 
for submission in the next COR session.  The group has drafted laws 
to enhance constitutional protections of equal opportunity (article 
16), freedom of expression and freedom of the press (article 38), 
the personal status code (article 41), the federal supreme court 
(articles 92-94) and the commission for human rights (article 102). 
 
¶2. (U) Al-Sheikhly said that 803 people, including several 
ministers, parliamentarians, clerics and civil society leaders, had 
signed a pledge of support to the Ahd al-Iraq platform.  Of the 803 
signatories, 24 were parliamentarians (NOTE: Four (4) 
parliamentarians are members of Ahd al-Iraq: Safia Suhail, Maysoon 
Damluji, Tania Gilley and Shatha Al-Obaisi. END NOTE).  COR bylaws 
state that any ten (10) members can introduce a law to the Speaker 
of COR, who can then refer it to a committee for consideration. 
Al-Sheikhly noted that this would be the vehicle for introducing the 
legislation to the COR, and asked for Embassy help in lobbying 
members for support. 
 
¶3. (U) Al-Sheikhly also said that her group held a series of 
seminars related to their draft legislation, and invited 
participants from across the spectrum to discuss the issues.  While 
the group has been careful to protect its political independence, it 
has also worked hard to engage with leaders of parties whose 
ideologies are very different from their own.  For example, 
Al-Sheikhly said that Sadrist Baha Al-Araji had attended a seminar 
on the personal status law at her invitation, and that she had also 
discussed it with SCIRI's Bayan Jabr.  She also noted that they were 
meeting with Minister of State for National Dialogue Affairs Dr. 
Akram Al-Hakim (SCIRI) to discuss how Ahd al-Iraq could contribute 
to the national reconciliation dialogue.
