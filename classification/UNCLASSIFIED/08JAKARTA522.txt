¶1. Summary.  The Indonesian Air Force confirmed receipt of spare 
parts listed in reftel and that they are being used for the purpose 
stated on the license.  We conducted a site visit to Indonesian firm 
PT Wira Kreasi Persada (Wira) and it appears to be a reliable 
recipient of United States Munitions List (USML) items.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. We visited PT Wira Kreasi Persada on March 5, 2008 and met the 
President Director Budiman Prawira and Operation Manager Bustaman 
Prawira to verify the order of items listed in reftel.  Bustaman 
confirmed that his company received the order in 2007 for nuts, 
bolts, screws and other parts from the IAF for their C-130 Hercules 
aircraft.  Bustaman provided us with contract documentation between 
IAF and Wira signed by both parties.  Bustaman also noted that his 
company was aware of restrictions on USML articles, particularly 
those that are re-exported.  Bustaman said that the items were 
delivered to IAF in October 2007. 
 
¶3. PT Wira Kreasi Persada was established in 1998 as a trading 
operation.  Its core business is supplying fuel filters to 
state-owned oil company PERTAMINA.  The company started supplying 
aircraft spare-parts to the IAF four years ago.  It also acts as a 
sales representative for several international suppliers, including 
US-based Arrow Dynamics and Singaporean Inovo Tech and Control 
Supply.  Wira has 11 employees located at a four story office 
building in central Jakarta. 
 
¶4. Bustaman said that orders from IAF are typically delivered 
directly to the IAF warehouse. IAF uses its own expediter for 
shipment of items from the airport to their warehouse.  However, in 
some cases the shipments are stored in a room at Wira's office for 
no more than one day before Wira delivers the items.  Bustaman said 
his company only supplies small spare parts and the office is 
guarded by two employees who live on the top floor of the office 
building, a common practice in Indonesia. 
 
¶5. We also contacted IAF Air Vice Marshal Sunaryo on February 4, 
2008 and confirmed that IAF received both orders detailed in reftel. 
 He verified that Wira is a registered company on the IAF supplier 
list.
