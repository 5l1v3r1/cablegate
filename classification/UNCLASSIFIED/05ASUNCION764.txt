SUBJECT: PARAGUAY ON SWISS CONFERENCE TO ADOPT A THIRD 
ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 104272 
 
On June 8, POLOFF met with Julio Peralta, Director for 
International Organizations within the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs to deliver reftel demarche and talking points. 
POLOFF urged Peralta to support the Swiss Government's 
circular note and to convey such support to them prior to 
June 17.  Peralta stated to POLOFF that he was familiar with 
the issue and knew of the Magen David Adom (MDA) group's 
work.  While, he noted that personally he agreed with the 
merits of adopting a third protocol to the Geneva Conventions 
that would provide added protection for humanitarian groups 
operating outside of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent 
Movements, he could not state the GOP's position without 
first discussing the matter with his colleagues in Geneva. 
He mentioned that he would pass along the talking points and 
would let POLOFF know the GOP position soon.  Post will 
follow-up on the issue and forward the response as it becomes 
available.
