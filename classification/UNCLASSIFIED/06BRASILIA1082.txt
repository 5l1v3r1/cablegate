titled "Parasite Antigenic Differences and Host Genetic in 
Tegumentary Leishmaniasis," or International Research Infectious 
Diseases (IRID) R03, (number AI070909 01 /PAS-04-111).  The site 
covered in this project is under the direction of Dr. Amelia M.

respect to this research project.  We emphasize the importance of 
complying with Brazilian laws on the export of data and biological 
material. 
 
¶3.  We are providing this assessment of foreign policy implications 
in advance of receiving approval from the Brazilian Government for 
the proposed research to go forward, in order to assist NIH in 
completing the domestic review process.  Upon receipt of Brazilian 
approval, the Embassy will notify NIH by cable.
