REACTION TO FAYYAD'S SPEECH 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Palestinian print coverage of Palestinian Authority Premier Fayyad's 
June 22 speech is neutral in tone, with Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida running the full text of the speech and Al-Quds' front 
page running extensive excerpts.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida leads with the 
speech, delivered at Al Quds University in Abu Dis, in which Fayyad 
called on Palestinians to unite and urged them to support the 
establishment of the Palestinian state and the promotion of good 
governance and institution building.  Fayyad identified his policy 
goal as the creation of a Palestinian state in the next two years, a 
state living beside Israel in a "comprehensive peace," according to 
coverage.  Fayyad considered Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's June 
14 speech as vague and lacking in commitment to the two-state 
solution. 
 
Al-Quds' continues to lead with wire coverage of unrest in Iran. 
 
Al-Quds' front page reports on the opening of all of Gaza's 
commercial crossing points on June 22 by the Israeli Government for 
three days, to allow "aid materials" into the Strip. 
 
Al-Ayyam's front page includes a report of attacks on Palestinians 
by Israeli settlers in the West Bank. The settlers are also reported 
to have confiscated more than 10 acres of land in Nahallin village 
in the Bethlehem area on June 22, "under the protection of" Israeli 
soldiers. 
 
Al-Ayyam's front-page includes recent developments in the prisoners' 
exchange between Israel and Hamas.  According to reports, the 
Israeli Government has submitted a new proposal to the Egyptians 
that aims at concluding the prisoners' exchange between Hamas and 
Israel.  Israel will release 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange 
for the release of Israeli soldier Shalit, according to reporting. 
 
Al-Quds' front page includes wire reports of Palestinian Authority 
President (PA) Abbas' decision to release most of the Hamas 
detainees currently in PA detention centers within twenty-four 
hours, as a good will gesture ahead of national unity talks. 
 
Al-Quds' front page also includes a report of the meeting between 
King Abdullah of Jordan and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown 
(June 22).  It is reported that King Abdullah stated to Brown that 
Israel must stop all "provocative measures" that jeopardize a peace 
agreement and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. 
 King Abdullah urged the international community to take serious 
measures in support of a regional peace and the establishment of a 
Palestinian state.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Hafith Al-Barghuti opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily 
under the title, "The speech of Bar Ilan, the speech of 
Al-Quds",(06/23):  " It is obvious from the location that Prime 
Minister Fayyad chose for his speech that he believes that Jerusalem 
is the capital of the Palestinian state... Fayyad seemed optimistic 
in his tone about the capabilities of the PA to lead a state... 
unlike Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu who does not seem ready to 
believe in a Palestinian state." 
 
2) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, "Dr. 
Salam Fayyad's speech," (06/23):  "The speech was rational and 
 
JERUSALEM 00001063  002 OF 002 
 
 
comprehensive... it provided a clear description of the current 
situation in the Palestinian Territories and motivates all parties 
to reach a settlement that will end the conflict... The speech 
stressed that the Palestinian Authority is the sole representative 
of the Palestinian people and is in charge of enforcing law and 
order." 
 
3) Hilmi Al-Ghul opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily under 
the title, "What distinguishes Fayyad's speech," (06/23):  "Although 
the speech was meant to present the new [PA] government's agenda, it 
was basically a reaction to Netanyahu's statements and perceptions 
about the Israeli Palestinian conflict... having Premier Fayyad 
present the official Palestinian reaction to these statements 
clearly reflects how much this man is trusted by the Palestinian 
leadership and conveys a firm message to all parties who try to 
undermine his authority."
