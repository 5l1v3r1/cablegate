GUIDELINES 
 
REF: HONG KONG 1493 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Macau Monetary Authority (Portuguese 
acronym AMCM) revised its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and 
Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) guidelines for 
financial institutions, effective September 1.  The 
strengthened guidelines now apply to money changers, 
remitters, and lenders and mandate Macau-based institutions 
ensure compliance by their overseas subsidiaries.  The 
revisions enhance due diligence requirements, in particular 
over politically exposed persons (PEP) and foreign customers 
from jurisdictions lacking a robust AML/CFT regime.  Audit 
teams and AMCM-approved compliance officers are now 
compulsory for all financial institutions.  Macau's Financial 
Intelligence Unit (Portuguese acronym GIF) will play an 
essential role in implementing the revised guidelines.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT: Macau authorities' commitment to developing 
AML/CFT capabilities has come a long way since the U.S. 
Treasury Department announced it was considering designation 
of Macau's Banco Delta Asia (BDA) as an institution of 
primary money laundering concern in 2006.  Despite relatively 
limited human resources, Macau has joined international 
AML/CFT organizations, improved training and education on 
AML/CFT compliance, tightened regulations and expanded 
oversight.  Serious concerns remain, however, particularly in 
oversight in the gaming sector and Macau's weak border 
controls.  Post continues to support Macau's AML/CFT capacity 
efforts through information sharing and training, most 
recently with a September 7-11 Bulk Cash Smuggling workshop 
for Macau officials conducted by personnel from U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP).  END COMMENT 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Macau Monetary Authority recently strengthened 
its 2006 AML/CFT guidelines for financial institutions 
operating in Macau, their overseas subsidiaries, and Macau 
branches of foreign-based institutions.  For the first time, 
AMCM has included guidance for money changers, remitters, 
lenders, venture capitalists, and asset managers operating in 
Macau.  Macau's first AML/CFT laws were passed in the wake of 
the U.S. Treasury Department's proposed designation of 
Macau's BDA as an institution of primary money laundering 
concern.  This revision strengthens the 2006 guidelines by 
incorporating recommendations made by the Asia Pacific Group 
on Money Laundering (APG) and the Offshore Group of Banking 
Supervisors (OGBS) in late 2006.

(Really) Know Your Customers

¶4. (SBU) The new AMCM guidelines require financial 
institutions to exercise increased due diligence in 
identifying and handling customers according to perceived 
AML/CFT risk.  High-profile customers, PEPs, and foreign 
customers from jurisdictions with substandard AML/CFT 
requirements or from countries with unstable political 
systems are subject to special scrutiny under the new rules. 
In addition, senior management at Macau's financial 
institutions must regularly review the effectiveness of their 
AML/CFT policies and maintain independent internal audit 
units to test their established procedures.  Institutions 
must also appoint AMCM-approved compliance officers, 
implement proper hiring screening procedures, and develop an 
employee AML/CFT training program that incorporates ML/FT 
laws, regulations, techniques, methods, and trends.

Financial Intelligence Unit's Role

¶5. (SBU) Staffed by AMCM banking regulators as an 
independent, but temporary, government entity in 2006, 
Macau's GIF analyzes Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) 
from the financial, insurance, and gaming sectors and chairs 
Macau's AML/CFT Working Group.  In 2006, the APG recommended 
the GIF be made a permanent body, but Macau officials, citing 
legal and bureaucratic obstacles, decided to only extend the 
GIF mandate for an additional three years (reftel).  Despite 
its temporary status, Macau officials say they are committed 
to maintaining and building the GIF's capacity, and its 
AML/CFT role is fundamentally emphasized throughout AMCM's 
revised guidelines.  GIF officials have informed us 
legislation institutionalizing the GIF may be proposed by
