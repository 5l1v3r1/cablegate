¶5.  In general, Spain is safe.  However, Madrid and other 
large cities in Spain attract a number of criminals and 
pickpockets and frequent incidents of crimes of opportunity 
against the unwary occur.  Carry only essential items, 
including a photocopy of your passport.  Visitors can protect 
themselves from crime by being street-smart, alert, and aware 
of their surroundings.  In the event you are victimized by 
crime, or experience any other security-related incident, 
please contact the Embassy's Regional Security Office at (91) 
587-2550.   Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of 
State's Web site (http://www.travel.state.gov) and the U.S. 
Embassy's Web site (http://www.embusa.es). 
 
¶6.  Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent 
Worldwide Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the 
Department of State continues to develop information on any 
potential security threats to Americans overseas, it shares 
credible threat information through its Consular Information 
Program documents, available on the Internet at 
(http://www.travel.state.gov).  In addition, travelers can 
hear recorded information by calling the Department of State 
in Washington, D.C. at (202) 647-5225 from a touch-tone 
telephone, or receive information by automated telefax by
