¶1. Per reftels, Post would like to place an op-ed in local media, 
and joins in Embassy London's request to receive generic text for 
such an op-ed from WHA.  In order to have time to translate the text 
into Latvian, we would ask that text be made available by May 16. 
 
¶2. In addition, we have spoken with the MFA regarding the May 21 
event, noting the active participation by their embassy in 
Washington at events to support Cuban democracy.  The MFA is 
currently considering how they may observe the Day of Solidarity 
with the Cuban People, and whether the GOL would like to participate 
jointly with Post in observance activities.
