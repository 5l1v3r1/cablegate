SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (08/20): Egypt continues to work 
with Palestinian factions for national reconciliation 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
Al-Quds front pages news citing Government of Israel sources denying 
an earlier announcement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that 
the GOI would not be issuing any new tenders for settlement 
construction until early 2010. Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports that the 
GOI is planning to revive a dormant construction project of 450 
housing units in the Pisgat Ze'ev settlement in East Jerusalem, 
quoting Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs and Vice Premier Moshe 
Yaalon saying that construction will continue and that he "isn't 
afraid of the Americans." Netanyahu is quoted in Al-Ayyam 
criticizing and rejecting Yaalon's statements. 
 
All dailies front page news on Palestinian Authority (PA) President 
Mahmoud Abbas's trip to Sudan and his meeting with Sudanese 
President Omar Al-Bashir in Khartoum on August 19. Abbas noted to 
the press that the PA is determined to support the national dialogue 
with Hamas and end the state of division. He said that his trip to 
Sudan is to discuss regional developments and to coordinate Arab 
efforts to move the peace process forward. 
 
The local press continues to report on the Egyptian delegation which 
visited the West Bank to meet with Palestinian factions in 
preparation for the next round of the national reconciliation 
dialogue scheduled for August 25 in Cairo. Before departing for 
Syria on August 19, the delegation received assurances that all 
factions are committed to supporting the dialogue and reconciliation 
efforts. 
 
Al-Quds runs inside coverage on General Paul Selva's visit to the 
Nablus Chamber of Commerce and Industry on August 19. General Selva 
met with a number of dignitaries and was briefed about the economicQd political situation in the governorate and the consequences of 
continued Israeli restrictions on Palestinian trade and industry.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Talal Okal opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the title, 
"The Palestinian dialogue, new dimensions" (08/20): "In preparation 
for the next round of national reconciliation talks, there is still 
l 
an extreme lack of confidence between Hamas and Fatah, a deep gap 
that is nurtured by the incitement and accusations from each party 
... In continuing its support of the dialogue, Egypt must realize 
that there is still a long way to go until Palestinian unity can be 
attained. The Egyptian role must be intensified to bridge the gaps 
prior to announcing signs of progress." 
 
2) Omar Hilmi Al-Ghoul opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily 
under the title "What is Netanyahu's response to Mubarak?" (08/20): 
"President Mubarak noted that the Arab states are ready to accept 
any peace settlement that would end the conflict in the region. 
However, the Israeli government and Prime Minister Netanyahu are not 
only determined to reject any freeze in settlement activity, but 
continue to provide the financial resources to support the continued 
construction. This makes any peace agreement almost impossible."
