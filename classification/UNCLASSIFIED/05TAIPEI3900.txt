SUBJECT:  Tainan Mayoral Election Heats Up 
 
Ref:  TAIPEI 
 
¶1. The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) party announced it will 
nominate Chien-Lin Hui-chun to run for Tainan Mayor in the 
upcoming mayoral election.  Chien-Lin is a Policy Advisor to 
the Presidential Office and Chief of TSU's party office in 
Tainan City.  She served as Tainan City Legislative Yuan 
(LY) member 2001-2004, but failed in her 2004 re-election 
bid.  She attributed her 2004 loss to the DPP's election 
campaign strategy, which helped all DPP candidates get 
elected but squeezed out pan-green and DPP-allied TSU 
candidates. 
 
¶2. Chien-Lin's nomination has shocked the heretofore- 
complacent local DPP organization and should affect the re- 
election prospects of incumbent DPP Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair. 
Chien-Lin stated her supporters encouraged her to run 
because they were upset with the current administration's 
performance.  She also stated that former President Lee Teng- 
hui is pleased with her decision to run.  To criticism from 
some DPP members accusing her of splitting the pan-green 
camp, she rejoined that Tainan City residents should have 
the chance to make their own choice. 
 
¶3. DPP Tainan City headquarters officials said they will 
continue seeking cooperation with the TSU.  Incumbent DPP 
Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair and KMT mayoral candidate Lin 
Jung-sheng both announced that they welcome Chien Lin to 
join the race and hope for a fair election. 
 
¶4. In response to TSU's nominating Chien-Lin Hui-chun for 
the Tainan mayoral election, the strongly independent 
Southern Taiwan Association, expressed concern that two pan- 
green candidates might undermine pan-green election 
prospects.  The Association is urging the pan-green camp to 
cooperate and nominate only one candidate, offering to 
mediate between TSU and DPP officials to seek a solution to 
this standoff.
