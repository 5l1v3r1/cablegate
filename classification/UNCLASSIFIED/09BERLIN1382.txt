REF:  SECSTATE 110439 
 
(U) The headquarters of the UN Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) confirmed receipt of the U.S. contribution of 
USD 5,650,000 to the UNFCCC budget.  The funds were allocated 
as follows: USD 3,388,802 - Core Budget; USD 303,123 - Trust 
Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC Process; USD 1,958,075 - 
Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities.  As the contribution 
was USD 100,000 less than expected, the allocation to the 
Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities was reduced by USD 
100,000.
