¶2.  (SBU) Ambassador July 5 received Romanian Ambassador to 
Morocco Vasile Popovici, who had requested an urgent meeting 
to discuss Romania's position on its troops in Iraq. 
Reaffirming Romania's commitment to the coalition in Iraq, 
Popovici explained that the Romanian Supreme Council for 
National Defense voted June 30 to reject the proposal 
announced by Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu and Defense 
Minister Teodor Atanasiu to withdraw Romanian troops by the 
end of the year.  Popovici argued that the 9-2 vote to reject 
the proposal demonstrated important support for the Romanian 
President, and for the US, with only the Prime Minister and 
Ministry of Defense supporting the proposal. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Explaining that troop involvement in Iraq is an 
emotional issue for Romania, Popovici said that the Prime 
Minister's announcement of this proposal was politically 
motivated.  Approximately 65 percent of Romanians are against 
troop involvement in Iraq, which certainly was one of the 
considerations for the Prime Minister's decision.  Minister 
of Defense Atanasiu sent a telegram to troops in Iraq 
"announcing" the pullout, which clearly violated Romanian law 
and was a "slap in the face" to the President, he said. 
Popovici added that several high level government officials, 
including the Foreign Minister Mihai Razvan and himself, 
offered to submit their resignations if the "announcement" 
was not corrected immediately.
