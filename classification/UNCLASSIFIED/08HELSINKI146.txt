(U) PolChief delivered Australia Group non-papers (reftels) 
to Tarja Pesamaa, Deputy Director of the Finnish MFA's Office 
of Nonproliferation, Arms Control and Disarmament April 1. 
PolChief also informed her that the US would be sending 
several additional non-papers in preparation for the April 
14-18, 2008 AG plenary in Paris.  Pesamaa thanked us for 
sharing the information.  She noted that the schedule change 
for the AG plenary has made it difficult for Finland to send 
its full team of experts to Paris, but reassured us that the 
GoF will be adequately represented.
