SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NOWRUZ MESSAGE TO IRAN 
 
¶1.  Summary: President Obama's Nowruz message to Iran received 
extensive coverage in the local media, both English and vernacular. 
Newspaper editorials across the political spectrum praised the 
President's message and called on Iran to accept the U.S. offer of 
dialogue.  President Obama's messages of dialogue and reconciliation 
with the Muslim world resonate extremely well in this moderate 
Muslim-majority nation of 150 million people.  We will continue to 
leverage the President's popularity in Bangladesh to advance key 
bilateral and multilateral goals in Bangladesh.  End summary. 
 
¶2. A selection of media reaction follows: 
 
¶A. "U.S. OLIVE BRANCH TO IRAN; AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A BETTER 
RELATIONSHIP," an editorial in the March 22 generally neutral 
English newspaper THE DAILY STAR: 
 
"The U.S. President's overture to Iran on the eve of the Persian New 
Year Nowruz is a significant departure from his predecessor's policy 
that never lost a chance to refer to Iran as a part of the axis of 
evil.  We welcome the change of attitude of an establishment that 
had looked at Iran, and indeed much of the Middle East and the 
Muslin world, with a blinkered vision (sic).  Mr. Obama should be 
congratulated for taking the first step, as he had promised in his 
campaign he would, seeking engagement with Iran that was 'honest and 
based on mutual respect....'  To build on the offer we feel that the 
first step for both the countries should be to create an environment 
of trust by appreciating and acknowledging the real compulsions of 
each other." 
 
¶B. "OBAMA'S PROPOSAL FOR DISCUSSIONS WITH IRAN," an editorial in the 
March 22 generally anti-West Bangla vernacular daily INQILAB: 
 
"President Obama, within the first two months of his presidency, 
proposed an end to the long period of distrust and enmity between 
Iran and the U.S.  His desire for developing relations between the 
two countries is a significant U.S. foreign policy indicator.  This 
proposal can be considered as a new initiative to rebuild a 
relationship that has been without formal diplomatic ties since 
¶1980.  President Obama pledged during his election campaign that he 
would develop a relationship between the two countries.  We thank 
President Obama for his good wishes and intent to start a dialogue, 
ignoring the path of conflict, with Iran.  Iran should respond to 
President Obama's proposal with cooperation and understanding." 
 
¶C. "IRAN SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PROPOSAL," an 
editorial in the March 22 pro-U.S. vernacular daily Ittefaq: 
 
"Nothing can be achieved by terrorism or by weapons.  Rather, 
peaceful activities are required to develop people and 
civilizations.  The Iranian government and the international 
community, including the European Union (EU), welcomed President 
Obama's desire for peace.  The Obama administration wants to reduce 
its differences with the Muslim world, created by former President 
Bush.  Many could see President Obama's desire for peace with the 
Muslim world as a key part of U.S. foreign policy when President 
Obama stated shortly after his inauguration that he intended to 
visit a Muslim country soon." 
 
¶D. "IRAN SHOULD ACCEPT OBAMA'S PROPOSAL FOR DIRECT TALKS," an 
editorial in the March 23 Jamaat- and BNP-leaning vernacular daily 
NAYA DIGANTA: 
 
"U.S. President Barak Obama recently urged the resumption of 
diplomatic discussions with Iran.  He diverted from decades of U.S. 
foreign policy in making this overture... In a recorded video, 
President Obama said his administration was committed to diplomacy. 
President Obama also pledged a new start, setting aside the 
bilateral jabs of the past.  The international community welcomed 
President Obama's decision.  At this point, we also welcome 
President's Obama's push for dialog in favor of the peace loving 
people of the world. 
 
¶E. "IRAN SHOULD SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY, TAKE OBAMA'S DIALOGUE OFFER," 
an editorial in the March 22 BNP-leaning English daily NEW NATION: 
 
"Barack Obama on Friday released a video message with Farsi 
subtitles that urged the two countries to resolve their 
long-standing differences....  The gesture of goodwill from 
President Obama is something that Iran did not consider since the 
fall of King Reza Shah and the birth of the Islamic revolution that 
made Iran an Islamic Republic three decades ago.  The response from 
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sounds pragmatic.  In fact, 
 
DHAKA 00000302  002 OF 002 
 
 
Iran should seize the opportunity to end the mistrust that developed 
between the two nations over the decades.  Obama promised this 
before his election, and it would be wise to give the U.S. President 
a chance to try to change the world through dialogue and 
understanding.... Since Barack Obama has signaled for fruitful 
dialogue, Iranian leaders should use all avenues to help make the 
initiative successful. After all, peaceful relations between the 
Muslims and the U.S. would end the principal cause of tension in 
current international relations and, hopefully, also help stop the 
wars."
