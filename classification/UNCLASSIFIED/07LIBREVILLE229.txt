SUBJECT: GABON ECONOMIC MISCELLANY 
 
¶1. LIBYAN INVESTMENT. There has recently been a flurry of 
Libyan investment in Gabon. Libreville's Intercontinental 
Hotel (the largest hotel in town) has been purchased by a 
Libyan company for 20 million dollars.  Other purchases 
include the Dialogue Hotel (a vacant hotel on prime 
beachfront property which is to be torn down for 
apartments/shops), Africa No. 1 (a radio station which 
broadcasts to francophone Africa) and the Mobil Oil 
distribution network (bought by Tamoil). 
 
¶2. NEW OIL FIND. Perenco Oil on May 12 announced that 
drilling has resulted in a new find at 1870 meters in waters 
off Ogooue-Maritime.  There is as yet no estimate regarding 
the extent of the find.  Perenco (a partner with Amerada 
Hess) is currently producing 48,000 barrels per day from 
other wells. 
 
¶3. BREAD PRICES REMAIN FIXED.  Gabon's Office for Consumption 
and Control has refused a request by bakers to raise the 
fixed price for a loaf of bread by 20%.  A baguette still 
costs approximately 25 US cents -- there has been no price 
change since 1989. 
 
¶4. ELECTRICITY INVESTMENT. SEEG, the Gabonese water and 
electricity utility, reports that it invested $62 million in 
2006 and plans $80 million in new investments for 2007.  When 
Libreville experienced rolling blackouts last February 
(something previously unknown in Gabon), critics accused SEEG 
of failing to invest in new capacity to meet the rising 
demand for electricity.
