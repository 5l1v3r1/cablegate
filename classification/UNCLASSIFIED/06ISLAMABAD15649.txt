RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 128442 
 
On August 7, POL made repeated efforts to contact officials 
at the MFA (UN Directorate) to convey reftel points and the 
draft text of the UNSC resolution on Lebanon.  As MFA 
Spokesperson and Director General (UN) Tasneem Aslam was 
unavailable for a meeting, POL delivered the reftel points 
and draft UNSCR text to her office as a non-paper.  Post will 
follow up with Aslam and convey to the Department any 
Government of Pakistan response to the U.S. call for broad 
support for the draft resolution.
