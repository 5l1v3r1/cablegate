REF: STATE 188249 
 
We delivered reftel draft resolution and letter to Varsenik 
Baghdassarian, acting head of the MFA's International 
Organizations Department, and subsequently followed up with 
the IO department, but so far have been unable to obtain a 
substantive response.  The MFA's IO operation is undergoing a 
leadership transition right now, and for the moment its 
decision-making processes are not operating effectively.
