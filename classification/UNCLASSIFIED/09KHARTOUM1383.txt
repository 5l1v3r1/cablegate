¶1. (U) Summary:  Southern Sudan continues to be plagued by a food 
security crisis in several states due to a combination of poor 
rainfall, heightened insecurity leading to population displacements, 
and high cereal prices.  Hope that the second cereal harvest in 
November would bring some relief has not been realized, as rain-fed 
crops in many areas fared poorly due to seasonal rains that tapered 
off prematurely.  According to the U.N. World Food Program (WFP), 
the eastern part of Southern Sudan, namely Jonglei, Eastern 
Equatoria, and the southern counties of Upper Nile, are of highest 
concern, which corresponds with the situation that Ethiopia and the 
region in general is experiencing.  Reporting from USAID/Office of 
Food for Peace's (FFP) three implementing partners in Southern Sudan 
indicates that the food security situation is of serious concern, 
but there are no indications of a famine in Southern Sudan at this 
time.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
UN WARNS AGAIN OF DETERIORATING SITUATION 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Based on preliminary results from two key assessments 
conducted in Southern Sudan during October-November 2009 - the Joint 
FAO-WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment (CFSAM) and WFP's Annual 
Needs and Livelihoods Assessment (ANLA) - the UN is beginning to 
alert donors to a continuing deterioration in the food security 
situation in several areas since it issued an emergency appeal in 
August.  As part of that appeal, WFP requested 22,000 metric tons 
(MT) of additional food aid in order to respond to an increase of 
300,000 people facing severe food insecurity in six states through 
the end of the year. Several other UN agencies, including UNICEF and 
FAO, also appealed for additional funding. 
 
¶3.  (U)  In addition, according to USAID-funded Famine Early Warning 
Systems Network (FEWSNET) reports, the expected improvement in food 
security following the second harvest is likely to be shorter than 
normal, and it is expected that food insecurity in Southern Sudan is 
likely to worsen starting in January 2010.  Some areas in eastern 
Jonglei will have little or no harvest due to lack of rain.  During 
her visit to Southern Sudan, UNICEF's Deputy Executive Director 
Hilde Johnson was quoted in several news reports as warning of the 
possibility of famine conditions developing should the situation not 
be managed well by the international community.  Reporting from 
FFP's three implementing partners in Southern Sudan indicates that 
the food security situation is of serious concern, but there are no 
indications of a famine in Southern Sudan at this time.  It should 
be noted, however, that malnutrition at emergency thresholds and 
above for children under five is common in many areas of Southern 
Sudan. 
 
-------------------------------- 
WFP'S APPEAL AND DONOR RESPONSE 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) WFP's Emergency Appeal for 2010 was issued in October, 
requesting USD 873.6 million in emergency food aid for all of Sudan. 
 However, the anticipated magnitude of additional food needs is 
becoming clearer following completion of these two assessments. 
WFP is therefore preparing to increase its appeal to be able to meet 
additional needs in Southern Sudan, as well as in other areas of the 
country.  The bulk of the revised appeal will be for needs in 
Southern Sudan, with USAID expecting more precise figures in the 
coming days. 
 
¶5. (U) As part of its emergency appeal in August, WFP requested 
funding for a food air drop operation.  Identifying 22 areas of 
highest priority that could not be reached by land or river, WFP 
requested $12 million in order to air drop 4,500 metric tons (MT) of 
commodities.  Prior to October 29, when the air drops of food to 
remote locations commenced, WFP had not resorted to this expensive 
and inefficient mode of food aid delivery since 2006, apart from 
limited emergency flood response deliveries.  Over the period of one 
month, WFP air-dropped a total of 2,083 MT of food into nine 
locations in Upper Nile, Jonglei, and Warrap states.  Operations 
were completed on November 28, one month early, due to the fact that 
many areas are now reachable overland. 
 
¶6.  (U) In addition to the U.S., other major donors to WFP include 
the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), Canada, and 
the Japanese Government.  In 2009, these donors have contributed USD 
60.5 million, USD 18 million, and USD 17 million to WFP's appeal 
respectively. The UK's Department for International Development 
(DFID) also supports WFP through its contribution to the UN's Common 
Humanitarian Fund for Sudan. Recently, ECHO indicated they are 
planning to provide additional emergency funding for Southern Sudan,

in light of the present situation.  Details are pending final 
decisions by ECHO. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
USG SUPPORT FOR FOOD SECURITY ACTIVITIES 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) The U.S. is the largest donor to WFP, one of the lead UN 
agencies for food security in Sudan.  To date in FY10, USAID has 
provided approximately USD 350 million to WFP.  Much of this funding 
was provided very early in order for the food to arrive in the 
beginning of 2010.  This will facilitate WFP's efforts to 
preposition food before the next rainy season, and to prevent food 
pipeline breaks.  In addition to funding the food aid appeal, USAID 
has also provided funding to support WFP's emergency airdrop 
operation.  Furthermore, USAID funds several NGO partners working on 
emergency food security activities in the south.

CONCLUSION 
----------- 
 
¶8.  (U) Post is closely tracking food security in Southern Sudan and 
USAID is working diligently with its partners to ensure that the 
most urgent needs of the food insecure populations are met.  As 
results from the various assessments are released and WFP confirms 
its plans for 2010 including the appeal for increased resources, 
post will provide additional reporting on the situation.
