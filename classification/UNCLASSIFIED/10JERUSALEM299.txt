SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (02/18): The investigation into 
Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Mabhouh's murder in Dubai continues to 
dominate local press coverage 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
For the third consecutive day, the investigation into the 
assassination of Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Mabhouh was front page news 
in the dailies. The lead stories report that Mossad was behind the 
attack and is being criticized for their "mistakes" (referring to 
using the identities of people residing in Israel to carry-out the 
assassination). Headlines report that the British Foreign Minister 
summoned the Israeli Ambassador to discuss Mossad using forged 
British passports. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown promised an 
investigation into the matter. Ma'an highlights on its homepage news 
that the operation was run out of Austria. 
 
The dailies also reported on various stories relating to the U.S. 
Al-Quds reports that "appointing an American Ambassador in Damascus 
is a result of the 'convergence' between the U.S. and Syria." 
Representative William Delahunt of Massachusetts is quoted in 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida saying "[Israeli Deputy Foreign 
Minister] Ayalon insulted the representatives of the American people 
when he refused to meet us in Jerusalem" in response to Ayalon 
refusing to meet with a Congressional delegation visiting Israel 
sponsored by the lobbying firm J Street. A headline in Al-Ayyam 
quotes Secretary Clinton saying "the U.S. does not intend to attack 
Iran." However, Ma'an highlights on its homepage a quote from the 
Russian Chief of Staff saying that the U.S. may attack Iran. 
 
Al-Quds highlights the conclusion of a visit to Gaza by MPs from 17 
Arab states. The headline quotes the head of the delegation saying 
that they "made serious and honest efforts to end the division." An 
Al-Quds headline also highlights Fatah and Hamas PLC members in Gaza 
assuring that the reconciliation plan will be signed soon. An 
Al-Ayyam headline says that Hamas will release 20 Fatah prisoners. 
However, a report in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida quotes Fatah spokesperson 
Al-Za'reer saying that the announcement to release Fatah prisoners 
is just a "cosmetic move." 
 
------------ 
BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------- 
 
Ali Al-Khalili opines in Al-Ayyam under the title "The American 
Disappointment" saying: "Secretary Clinton said in Qatar that she, 
President Obama, and Special Envoy Mitchell are disappointed in the 
absence of progress in peace talks between Palestinians and 
Israelis...there is a disappointment indeed. It's a Palestinian 
disappointment in the U.S. position after President Obama's promises 
of change [a new beginning]. Arabs and Palestinians welcomed these 
promises hoping for freedom and justice. The change was nothing but 
more support for the Israeli position, like previous U.S. 
presidents."
