¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, NST OMZ Research Center for EOM, Moscow, Russia. 
The company is listed on BIS license application 
D367877 as the ultimate consignee of four field 
programmable gate arrays, model: AX2000-CQ352M. These 
items are controlled for national security, missile 
technology, nuclear non-proliferation and anti- 
terrorism reasons under ECCN 3A001. The licensee is 
Actel Corporation, 2061 Stierlin st., Mountain View, 
CA 94043. 
 
¶3. NOTE: ECO Moscow conducted PSV- D328969 with a 
favorable recommendation for the same type of 
commodity going to the Federal Space Agency for 
incorporation into the Meteor-M satellite.  The 
Meteor-M is a metrological satellite (detailed 
information is available at the following NOAA 
website: http://ceosplenary17.noaa.gov/roshydromet. 
pdf). Also, post recently consulted with the Political 
Military Section on a Blue Lantern check at the 
Federal Space Agency, also recommended as favorable. 
 
¶4. On July 5, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with NST OMZ 
Research Center for Earth Operative Monitoring, 51, 
bld 25, Dekabristov st., Moscow, Russia. The export 
control team met with Sergey Kocherov, Master 
Scientist and Dr. Victor Feygin, Deputy Director. 
 
¶5. NST was founded in 1974 to produce satellites for 
use in meteorology and geophysical survey purposes. 
The organization is funded by the Russian Federal 
Space Agency (Russian acronym ROSKOSMOS).  Recently 
the organization launched new satellites for 
geophysical research, "Resource DK" and "SECh-1M." 
With each launch, NST produces a resource book in 
Russian outlining the satellite and its capabilities. 
NST makes these books available to interested parties. 
 
¶6. The FPGAs in reftel were used in the production of 
the information storage and transmission module of the 
"Elekra-L" and "Meteor-M" satellites, due for launch 
in 2008.  The satellites are in the final stages of 
assembly, and all four FPGAs have been incorporated 
into the appropriate modules.  The team was shown the 
sealed module, and examined the technical documents 
regarding the assembly of the module.  The satellites 
will burn upon reentry after their usable life, which 
is estimated at around 7 years. 
 
¶7. The equipment is stored in the laboratory, which is 
guarded by on-site security 24 hours a day.  When the 
unit is to be transferred to the satellite fabrication 
facility, NST technical specialists will escort it to 
the final testing area and the satellite fabrication 
facility.  Dr. Feygin will be personally responsible 
for the project as chief constructor. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends NST OMZ Research 
Center for Earth Operative Monitoring, Moscow, Russia 
as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities.
