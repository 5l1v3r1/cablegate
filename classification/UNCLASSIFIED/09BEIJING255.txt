China-U.S. Relations 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. China and the United States have maintained "close communication" 
since the inauguration of President Barack Obama, said spokesperson 
Jiang Yu at the February 3 regularly scheduled MFA press conference. 
Jiang noted that Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao have spoken 
on the phone as have Secretary Clinton and Chinese Foreign Minister 
Yang Jiechi.  China is "ready to work with the United States to 
promote bilateral relations," said Jiang.  China will also "stick to 
the road of peaceful development."  Regarding economic relations, 
leaders in both countries would like to "maintain trade cooperation" 
and both Hu and Obama have "stressed the importance of 
macro-economic cooperation," said Jiang.  Asked about Secretary 
Clinton's reported trip to China, Jiang said that "high level visits 
are important" and the two sides are "in close contact" regarding 
the Secretary's visit. 
 
China's Relations with India and Pakistan 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. China and India are "cooperative partners" and "not competitors," 
and the relationship is "conducive to world peace and regional 
stability," said Jiang. China is "also a friend of Pakistan" and 
hopes that Pakistan and India will "proceed from the interests of 
regional stability and promote the peace process in South Asia." 
China maintains a policy of "good neighborly relations" with 
bordering countries. 
 
North Korean Missile Preparations 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. China has "taken note" of press reports stating that North Korea 
is preparing for a missile test, but "does not have details," said 
Jiang.  As a "close neighbor," China hopes that North and South 
Korea can "work together."  Asked about the Six-Party Talks, Jiang 
said the Talks had "made important progress" and China "hopes the 
six parties can work together to play a constructive role in 
maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula." 
 
Nansha Islands 
-------------- 
 
¶5. Asked about a bill currently being considered in the Philippines 
that would lay claim to the disputed Nansha Islands, Jiang said that 
China has "undisputable sovereign rights" over the islands and 
surrounding waters.  "Due to the efforts of all parties, the region 
is currently stable," said Jiang.  Parties should not take actions 
which "might lead to disputes or complications" in order to "protect 
the stability of the region." 
 
Sanctions against Chinese Companies 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6. China has "noted" the recent U.S. sanctions against two Chinese 
 
BEIJING 00000255  002 OF 002 
 
 
companies, said Jiang.  The position of the Chinese government on 
nonproliferation is "clear," however, China is "resolutely against" 
U.S. sanctions for Chinese companies "based on so called domestic 
law." 
 
China-EU Summit 
--------------- 
 
¶7. Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has "stressed that the China-EU 
Summit should resume as soon as possible," said Jiang.  Jiang added 
that "both sides" are working on the issue. 
 
Wen Jiabao Shoe Throwing Incident 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶8. The throwing of a shoe at Prime Minister Wen Jiabao during his 
visit to the UK was "disruptive" and "despicable" said Jiang.  The 
British police will handle the incident according to law and the 
incident will "not stem the tide of China-British relations."  Wen's 
trip to the United Kingdom was "well received" and "achieved great 
success."  Asked why the MFA spokesperson made a joke about a 
similar incident involving President Bush but takes this incident 
seriously, Jiang said that she felt that "both comments are 
proper." 
 
Visits 
------ 
 
¶9. Hu Jintao will visit Saudia Arabia, Mali, Senegal, Tanzania and 
Mauritius from February 10-17.  Deputy Vice Premier Hui Liangyu will 
visit Argentina, Ecuador, Barbados and the Bahamas from February 
7-19.  Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jieyi will visit Germany on 
February 4 and Rome on February 5.
