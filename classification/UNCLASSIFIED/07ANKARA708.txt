In Today's Papers 
 
Annual ATC Conference in Washington 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Yeni Safak and 
others report Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a speech to the 
annual American Turkish Council (ATC) meetings in Washington that 
the Armenian genocide resolution and anti-American sentiment in 
Turkey were both "detrimental action" against US-Turkey ties.  Gates 
also said more needed to be done against the PKK.  Papers also 
report Ambassador Wilson called for "reconciliation and 
normalization of Turkey-Armenia relations." Papers also report the 
deputy chief of Turkish General Staff (TGS) General Ergin Saygun 
reacted to former Kurdish lawmaker Leyla Zana's remarks, who had 
said that Jalal Talabani, Massoud Barzani, and Abdullah Ocalan were 
"the three leaders of the Kurdish people."  Saygun stressed such 
remarks invited the Iraqi Kurds to interfere with Turkey's internal 
affairs, and said that "Turkish prosecutors will do what is 
necessary regarding what such dangerous statements mean." 
 
Beckett Cuts Turkey Visit Short over British Sailors Crisis with 
Iran 
All papers report Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul asked his Iranian 
counterpart Manuchehr Mottaki on the phone yesterday for the 
settlement of the crisis over Iran's detention of 15 British sailors 
on charges of violating Iran's territorial waters.  Visiting British 
Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett has reportedly asked Turkey to 
assume a role in the settlement of the controversy with Iran.  After 
holding a phone talk with Mottaki in the company of Gul, a 
disillusioned Beckett decided to return to London.  "I had hoped 
that the situation involving our missing sailors would have been 
resolved by now.  I have decided with regret to curtail my visit 
here so that I can report to our parliament tomorrow on the latest 
position," Beckett said in a statement. 
 
Meanwhile, CNN Turk quoted Prime Minister Erdogan as saying early 
Wednesday at the Arab League meeting in Riyadh that Turkish 
diplomats may be allowed to visit British military personnel 
detained in Iran. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Iran 
Okay Gonensin commented in the mainstream daily Vatan:  "An expected 
tension is building after Iran's seizure of British soldiers.  At 
the end of this tension there stands the possibility of a military 
operation against Iran by the US-UK alliance.  Iran is already in a 
war with Israel at the Lebanese border and through Shiites in Iraq. 
With a possible US-UK intervention, the war will cross into Iranian 
territory.  In this case, the fire will come closer to Turkish 
territory and our southeastern border will turn into a war front. 
There might be some people considering such possibilities as new 
opportunities for Turkey.  Some might try to use this big fire as an 
excuse and try to resolve the northern Iraq issue.  However, there 
is only one result that could be reached from such logic: to push 
Turkey into a fire which is not in Turkey's direct interest.  As the 
possibility of a US-UK intervention in Iran increases, Turkey's 
policy should be to stay as far as possible away from this conflict 
environment.  Turkey's short, medium and long term interests lie 
with Turkey remaining a strong fortress of peace in the region.  The 
founders of this republic managed to keep Turkey out of trouble, 
even in more complex periods.  There were people who tried to 
benefit from big fires in the past as well.  Nevertheless, our 
recent history shows clearly what was right and what was wrong." 
 
Sami Kohen observed in the mainstream daily Milliyet:  "The 
Administration in Iran might try to use the hostages as a trump card 
for a lengthy time against the western world.  Doubtlessly, this 
could turn into a very dangerous game.  British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair stressed yesterday that if diplomatic attempts do not resolve 
this issue, a new phase would be entered.  The new phase doesn't 
have to be a military operation against Iran, but any act of 
retaliation would increase the tension.  Therefore, everyone should 
 
ANKARA 00000708  002 OF 003 
 
 
exert efforts to resolve this issue peacefully before it moves to 
more dangerous phases.  Turkish diplomacy has already intervened in 
the issue for just these reasons.  Recently, the Persian Gulf became 
a field for the US, UK and Iran to exhibit their powers.  This stems 
from the region's economic and strategic importance and the conflict 
between the US (UK) and Iran over this strategic importance for 
their own interests.  Although, the seizure of 15 UK troops by Iran 
seems rather a small incident which could be resolved easily, in 
fact, it is the result of this fight between the big powers." 
 
Akdamar Church to be Opened Tomorrow 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others 
report an Armenian government delegation led by deputy Culture 
Minister Gagik Gurjyan arrived early on Wednesday in the eastern 
city of Kars to participate in the inauguration of the Armenian 
Church on Akdamar Island near Van.  Milliyet reports the spiritual 
leader of Armenian Orthodox Church, Karekin II, said he will not 
participate in the opening set for March 29, because the church has 
been renovated into "a museum." 
 
Meabwhile, Hurriyet reports Prime Minister Erdogan and Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Gul have sent messages of condolence over the 
death of Armenian Prime Minister Andranik Margaryan to President 
Kocharian and Foreign Minister Oskanyan through the Turkish Embassy 
in Georgia. 
 
Iraq's Vice President Visits Turkey 
All papers report the Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi met with 
President Sezer, Prime Minister Erdogan, and Foreign Minister 
Abdullah Gul during his one-day visit to Ankara on Tuesday.  Hashimi 
said in response to press questions that Baghdad will not permit 
Turkish cross-border military incursions into northern Iraq.  He 
said Turkey and Iraq should respect each other's borders and not 
meddle in each other's affairs.  Hashimi said Iraq understands 
Turkey's sensitivity with regard to the PKK issue, but added that 
the current conditions placed obstacles in front of the fight 
against the PKK.  The Iraqi VP, however, said Iraq will never allow 
its land be used as a base for attacks against Turkey.
