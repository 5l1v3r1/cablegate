¶1. Key points at the September 27 MFA Press Briefing were: 
 
-- China hopes all parties in Burma can "exercise restraint" 
so as to avoid escalation of the situation.  China also urged 
the press to report truthfully and avoid "exaggerated hype."

completed. 
 
-- China has seen the reports of Syrian-DPRK cooperation. 
China has a consistent position on nonproliferation and 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will be good for 
non-proliferation.

rescued, the remains of three others have been located and 
one remains missing.  China maintains hope and will not give 
up the search.

China Hopes for "Restraint" In Burma 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  At the September 27 regular MFA press briefing, 
spokeswoman Jiang Yu said China has been closely following 
the situation in Burma and hopes that all parties exercise 
restraint so as to avoid escalation or a negative effect on 
regional stability.  She also expressed hope that the press 
would report on the situation in Myanmar truthfully with no 
"exaggerated hype."  Some in the press had attacked China out 
of "ulterior motives," she said.  Asked to clarify, Jiang 
said everyone had read the reports and seen examples.  Asked 
if China would support a UN Security Council Resolution on 
Burma, she said the Security Council had discussed this topic 
and the Chair had spoken to the press.  She said the 
international community should provide "constructive 
assistance" to relax the situation in Myanmar and China 
supports the mediation of the UN Secretary General.  Asked if 
any high-level visits had taken place between China and 
Burma, she said she had no information but had already made 
China's position clear.  Asked specifically if China 
condemned the violence in Myanmar, Jiang refused to answer 
because the journalist asking "had come late to the press 
conference." 
 
Six-Party Talks and Fuel Aid to DPRK 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  Asked if China had completed shipping heavy fuel to the 
DPRK and if that would influence the Six-Party Talks, Jiang 
said that the fuel shipment was complete.  She said the 
opening phase of the Six-Party Talks would take place the 
same evening and China is ready to work to finalize a joint 
statement to move the talks forward.  She hoped that all 
parties could work together to achieve results.  Asked about 
specifics of the oil shipment and a timetable for disablement 
of nuclear facilities in the DPRK, Jiang responded only that 
the oil arrived "recently" and that details of disablement 
would be discussed in the Six-Party Talks. 
 
Syria and the DPRK 
------------------ 
 
¶4. Asked if the reports of DPRK nuclear collaboration with 
Syria would impact the Six-Party Talks, Jiang said she had 
seen the reports and statements.  She said China has a clear 
and consistent policy on nonproliferation and that 
denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula would be good for 
nonproliferation. 
 
The Search for Missing Russians 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5. China made a great effort to mobilize joint 
search-and-rescue efforts that led to the rescue of two 
Russians missing in Xinjiang and the recovery of the remains 
of three others.  Jiang said that while joint search efforts 
with Russia had ended yesterday, China will not give up hope 
or cease its efforts to find the final missing Russian. 
 
¶6. VISITS: Philippines President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo will 
visit China October 2-3 to attend the Special Olympics in 
 
BEIJING 00006339  002 OF 002 
 
 
Shanghai and then visit Shandong province.
