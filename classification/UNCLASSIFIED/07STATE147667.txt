SUBJECT: URGENT DARFUR DEMARCHE FOR AVIATION SUPPORT AND 
TRANSPORTATION ASSETS 
 
REF: STATE 136068 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1.  Purpose and Objective:   This is an action request.  All 
Embassies on the action line are requested to make a 
high-level demarche by the Ambassador or the DCM requesting 
the host country to provide the support listed below for the 
UN-AU hybrid peacekeeping operation in Darfur, Sudan 
(UNAMID).  The Department understands that the Embassy may 
have previously demarched these countries for these assets 
requested below.  Department anticipates that 7th floor and 
NSC calls will be required but believes we need to exhaust 
all efforts at Post first. Department therefore asks 
Embassies to make every reasonable effort to persuade host 
authorities to reconsider if they have indicated that they 
could not support the request.  The equipment required is as 
follows: 
 
      -- 6 Attack helicopters for the heavy support package 
      -- 6 Utility helicopters for the heavy support package 
      -- 12 Utility helicopters for UNAMID deployment 
      -- 2 Transport companies for UNAMID deployment 
 
¶2.  Deadline:  The deadline for Embassies to respond is 
October 25, 2007. 
 
¶3.  Background:  Timely deployment of the United 
Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) is one the 
Department of State,s top priorities in the United Nations. 
UNAMID currently lacks critical aviation and transportation 
assets.  UNAMID will be a predominantly African force and has 
received generous contributions of many African infantry 
units (including Rwanda, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, Burkina 
Faso, Mali, and Malawi).  Nevertheless, UNAMID still lacks 
commitments for critical force multipliers/enablers, 
including units to provide adequate aviation and 
transportation support assets.  The Department wishes to 
assist the UN as much as possible in the successful and rapid 
deployment of UNAMID, for which aviation and heavy 
transportation assets are essential given the need for 
mobility in such a large territory with difficult terrain. 
Deployment of a robust, effective hybrid force is a critical 
part of our strategy for sustainable peace in Darfur.  Host 
countries that may be able to respond positively to this 
request should be asked to bring their capabilities to the 
urgent attention of the UN's Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations (DPKO) in New York and to engage DPKO in direct 
discussions of the UN's precise requirements. 
 
¶4.  Note for Seoul:  Dept recognizes that this demarche 
request comes at a sensitive time with regard to the National 
Assembly's consideration of South Korea's other international 
engagements, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 
¶4.  Point of Contact:  LTC James D. Thomas or Grace M. Kang, 
IO/PSC, 202 736-7733.  The email addresses for the POCs are 
thomasjd@state.gov and kanggm@state.gov; please include 
IO-PSC users-DL (IO-PSCusers@state.gov) from the GAL on the 
CC line.
