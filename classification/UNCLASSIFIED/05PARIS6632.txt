INSTRUCTIONS FROM CAPITAL, SUPPORTS CANADIAN 
RESOLUTION ON CULTURAL DIVERSITY. 
 
Refs:  A) Paris 6564  B) State 170909 C) Kiev 3834 
 
As recounted in ref A, the United States stood 
alone in voting against a Canadian resolution that 
paved the way for the October 2005 adoption of a 
cultural diversity Convention at UNESCO's General 
Conference.  Per ref B, posts met with host 
country officials to explain the reasons why the 
UNG opposes this badly flawed instrument.  Though 
Ref C indicates that the Ukrainian ambassador to 
UNESCO had the authority to formulate a position 
on behalf of her government, she told the DCM that 
she had been instructed by her government to 
support the convention and voted in favor of the 
Canadian resolution.
