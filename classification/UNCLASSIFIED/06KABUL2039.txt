1.SUMMARY: A State Department delegation, led by 
U/S Fore (M), visited Panjshir, Afghanistan, to see 
the PRT, talk with its members, hear briefings on 
PRT issues, tour Massouds tomb, and meet the 
Governor.  After warmly welcoming the group, the 
Governor:  Offered his personal commitment to the 
security of the PRT; stated the PRT enjoyed a close 
working relationship with him and a smooth 
interaction with the Panjshiris; posited a common 
strategic outlook between the U.S. and Panjshir 
forged in the struggle against the Soviets and then 
the Taliban; expressed interest in exploring a 
partnership with West Virginia; and cited three 
sectors where Panjshir would welcome outside 
investment.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  The State delegation, visiting Panjshir April 
23, comprised Henrietta Fore, Under Secretary for 
Management; Edward Alford, NEA/SA Executive 
Director;  Scott Gallo, Deputy Regional Director 
NEA/SA for Diplomatic Security; and Maria Brewer, 
Special Assistant to the U/S.  Representing Embassy- 
Kabul were Rosie Hansen, Management Counselor; Tom 
Praster, Director of the PRT Office; Sebron Toney, 
y, 
head of management in the PRT Office; and Joe 
Ferrero, Control Officer.  COL Marvin Schlatter, 
head of Task Force Tiger at Bagram, also attended. 
 
PRT issues 
---------- 
 
¶3.  Members of the entire PRT greeted the U/S upon 
her arrival at the PRT office facility, where she 
had a chance to hear their impressions of work in 
Panjshir.  She then toured the 10-room facility and 
participated in briefings on PRT matters.  The 
Director of the Embassy PRT section provided an 
overview of the twenty-three PRTs throughout the 
country and explained the nature of the NATO/ISAF 
transition.  Turning to Panjshir, PRTDIR outlined 
the unique structure of the Panjshir PRT, lauded the 
reach-back support at the Embassy in Kabul and 
Airfield in Bagram, and offered assessments of local 
officials and issues. 
 
Gubernatorial views 
------------------- 
 
¶4.  Governor Bahlul gave the delegation a warm 
welcome at his office.  In response to the U/S on 
security, the Governor said he was personally 
committed to ensuring the safety of the PRT now that 
it had opened its facilities in the valley.  He 
recalled the founding of the PRT in November 2005 
and said it was now well established.  He described 
his close working relationship with the various 
interagency members of the team.  The PRT, he said, 
was an active presence in the valley; it worked at 
the grassroots level in the villages.  The 
interaction with the Panjshiris was proceeding well. 
Villagers, he said, sensed that the PRT respected 
their religious practices and traditional way of 
life.  Further, they saw with their own eyes the 
tangible progress initiated by the PRT through a 
host of projects.

Strategic commonalities 
----------------------- 
 
¶5.  The U.S. and Panjshir, the Governor stated, were 
linked by a common strategic outlook.  Both had 
joined forces to oppose the Soviets and then the 
Taliban.  Both suffered at the hands of the same 
enemy in September 2001 when we lost our great 
reat 
leader and you lost the Twin Towers.  At this 
point, the Governor gestured to the portrait of 
Massoud, hanging next to that of President Karzai on 
the office wall.  (Note:  During the visit, the 
delegation viewed old Soviet tanks that the 
Mujahideen, under the leadership of Massoud, had 
captured in the 1980s.  The program returned to the 
Massoud theme at its conclusion, when the group 
visited the tomb of the Panjshiri who fell to 
assassins on September 9, 2001.  End Note.) 
 
Political opinions 
------------------ 
 
¶6.  The U/S, noting the inclusion in the meeting of 
the three women members of the Provincial Council, 
asked about the political role of women in Panjshir. 
The Governor said women were just now assuming 
political responsibilities there.  He wanted to 
advance their careers, but at an appropriate pace. 
Recalling his days as a Mujahideen commander, he 
said he had never ordered an unprepared soldier into 
battle.  Likewise, he did not wish to place undue 
expectations on the women members of the Council. 
In the long run, he concluded, education was 
critical to prepare women for political and 
administrative careers. 
 
¶7.  Picking up on the U/S reference to a recent 
visit at the Embassy in Kabul of four U.S. 
governors, the Panjshiri Governor expressed his 
gratitude for the chance to exchange views.  He was, 
he said, most intrigued by his counterpart from West 
Virginia.  The two had agreed to stay in touch, 
explore a partnership and perhaps someday visit one 
another in their respective homes. 
 
Economic needs 
-------------- 
 
¶8.  Later, over lunch, the Governor spoke about the 
rudimentary state of development in the valley.  He 
cited three areas in which Panjshir had natural 
advantages that, with proper investment, might lead 
to job generation and economic growth:  water 
bottling, tourism promotion and gemstone extraction. 
 
Bio info 
-------- 
 
¶9.  The Governor also touched on his family life. 
He said he had his hands full in raising his five 
children, three girls and two boys; the oldest being 
a 16-year-old daughter, the youngest, a 4-year-old 
boy.  He estimated his official family  that is, 
his staff  at around thirty-five.  He lamented that

his gubernatorial duties prevented him from spending 
much time with his family.
