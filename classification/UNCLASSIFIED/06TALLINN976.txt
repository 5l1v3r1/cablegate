REF STATE 178061 
 
(U) On October 27 Poloff delivered reftel points to Kirke 
Kraav, MFA Director of International Organizations and 
Cooperation, on opposing anti-Israel bias in the UNGA. 
Kraav said that the MFA shares the USG's concerns and 
believes that all sides of the Middle-East conflict need to 
be involved in addressing this problem.  "We likewise 
disapprove of the proliferation of resolutions and 
duplication within the Human Rights Council and the Third 
Committee," said Kraav.  Estonia's vote will reflect its 
disapproval of this biased approach, she said.
