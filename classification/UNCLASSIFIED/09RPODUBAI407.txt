SUBJECT: IRAN: INITIAL IRANIAN PRESS REPORTS ON GENEVA MEETINGS 
FACTUAL, POSITIVE 
 
REF: RICHARDSON-NEA/IR E-MAIL 10/2/09 
 
¶1. This cable repeats ref e-mail. 
 
 
 
¶2. Inititial Iranian press coverage of the P5+1 negotiations in 
Geneva and the bilateral meeting between U/S Burns and Iranian 
negotiator Jalili has been factual, without editorial comment. 
Coverage in the sources we checked was positive, drawing on 
statements by Jalili and EU Representative Solana during the 
post-negotiation press conference in characterizing the meeting. 
 The President's statement and the Secretary's remarks were also 
reported by some Iranian media. 
 
 
 
¶3. Jalili's comments that Iran has not surrendered it's nuclear 
rights, that it has called for global nuclear disarmament, and 
that its proposed framework for negotiations was the basis for 
talks was reported extensively.  The moderate Iranian Students 
News Agency (ISNA) led its story on Jalili's press conference 
with his statement that negotiations would continue.  It also 
reported his characterization of the negotiations as positive 
and based on dialogue in areas of common interest.  Ayande News 
and other outlets reported Iran's agreement to allow IAEA 
inspectors access to the newly disclosed second uranium 
enrichment facility near Qom and the agreement to further enrich 
Iranian uranium outside Iran for use in Iran's research reactor, 
quoting Solana. 
 
 
 
¶4. Tabnak, which is owned by Expediency Council Secretary and 
former presidential candidate Mohsen Rezaei, quoted a British 
Foreign Office spokesman contradicting Iranian claims that its 
framework had been agreed, while noting Jalili's statements on 
Iran's nuclear rights and the need for global disarmament. 
Opposition website Rahesabz reported that while some state media 
had hailed Iran's assertion of its rights, Western media had 
focused on Iran's agreement to inspections at Qom and acceptance 
of enrichment outside the country in a story headlined, "Geneva 
Talks: Iran's Retreat, Western Optimism." 
 
 
 
¶5. The centrist Iran Labor News Agency (ILNA) ran a separate 
story on the President's statement.  It quoted him as saying 
that the Geneva meeting was a constructive beginning but that 
Iran must take practical steps to make its nuclear activities 
more transparent and to cooperate with the IAEA and 
international community.  ILNA also reported the President's 
warning that Iran would face increased pressure if it was not 
more forthcoming.  Rahesabz reported the President's remarks, 
including US support for Iran's right to nuclear energy and the 
US commitment to negotiations, as well as his comment that the 
US is not interested in talking for the sake of talking. 
Semi-official, right-wing Fars News, which has ties to the IRGC, 
quoted the Secretary's comment that the talks were constructive 
but that Iran needed to take observable actions toward meeting 
the international community's concerns. 
 
 
 
¶6. Iranian press gave considerable coverage to the bilateral 
meeting between U/S Burns and Jalili.  While little coverage 
went beyond the Department's announcement that the meeting had 
taken place, Tabnak noted that unlike Iran's previous 
discussions on the nuclear issue, this time it was face-to-face 
with the US.  Rahesabz described the meeting as "unprecedented." 
 Rajanews, which is thought to be affiliated with President 
Ahmadinejad, also reported that the meeting had occurred. 
 
 
 
¶7.  Editorial comment will likely come over the next several 
days.  Most Iranian news organizations do not publish on Friday, 
and the IRIG is likely in the process of determining the tone of 
editorials in state-run and semi-official media.
