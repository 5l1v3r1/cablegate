CONFERENCE 
 
¶1.  Summary. Amb. Gianludovico De Martino, Italian MFA Iraq 
Task Force Director, told poloff that the Italian proposal 
for a lessons learned conference would focus on three topics: 
successful transition of security responsibility to Iraqi 
authorities, increased focus on PRTs as a tool in 
distributing and monitoring assistance, and an increased 
linkage between the Iraq Compact and PRTs.  The conference, 
tentatively scheduled for mid-May in Italy, would include the 
participation of representatives of governments (including 
the Iraqi Government), international organizations and civil 
society organizations with in-country experience. End Summary. 
 
¶2.  On April 5, De Martino outlined for poloff his plan for 
an Iraq lessons learned conference in Italy tentatively 
scheduled for mid-May.  De Martino hoped to encourage 
attendance by all coalition partner nations, significant Iraq 
Compact nations, international organizations, and civil 
society organizations with in-country experience in Iraq. 
The first objective of the conference would be to focus on 
the successful transition of security responsibilities to 
Iraqi authorities focusing on the Italian experience in 
Nassyriah and the UK experience in southern Iraq - i.e. not 
concentrating on pacifying Iraq, but rather, focusing on 
increasing Iraqi institutional capability to deal with 
persistent security threats. The first part of the security 
discussion will include only government officials from 
coalition partner nations.  The second part of the security 
discussion would also involve Iraqi government officials. 
 
¶3. The second objective of the conference would be to 
encourage greater use of PRTs by international donor 
organizations.  De Martino noted that many international 
organizations, including the UNDP and EC, could benefit 
greatly by embedding teams or officials in the PRTs to take 
advantage of the existing networks, experience and 
infrastructure.  In many parts of the country, PRTs 
represented the only international presence.  Additionally, 
PRTs already understand the economic, infrastructure and 
humanitarian requirements of the provincial governments and 
have experience monitoring assistance funds. 
 
¶4. The final objective of the conference would focus on 
making efficient use of the Iraq Compact.  De Martino hinted 
that he might want to lead a discussion about the possibility 
of linking the on-the-ground experience of the PRTs to the 
Iraqi Compact funding framework.  This part of the conference 
would depend on developments in launching the Iraq Compact. 
 
¶5. De Martino stated that an agenda and proposal for 
participants would be distributed next week, but welcomed any 
recommendations for civil society participants and agenda 
points.
