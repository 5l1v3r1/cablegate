SUBJECT: MEXICO ON NICARAGUAN RECOGNITION OF SOUTH OSSETIA 
AND ABKHAZIA 
 
REF: STATE 96677 
 
Acting PolCouns discussed reftel demarche 9/15 with Julian 
Juarez, the Deputy Director General of the Office of Peace 
and International Security in the Foreign Ministry's UN 
Office, conveying our concern about Nicaraguan President 
Ortega's announcement that Nicaragua recognizes the 
independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Juarez conveyed 
GOM surprise and disappointment with Ortega's announcement as 
the GOM does not share this approach.  He didn't discount 
Mexico taking advantage of an upcoming meeting with Nicaragua 
at some point in the future and conveying its opinion on this 
issue but he wasn't prepared to commit that it would do so. 
Instead, he suggested the U.S. consider discussing this 
matter in the context of the upcoming U.S., Mexico, and 
Canada trilat on the margins of the UNGA.
