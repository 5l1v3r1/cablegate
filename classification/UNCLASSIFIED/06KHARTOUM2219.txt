¶1.  Summary:  On September 13, 2006, the Embassy Khartoum 
Emergency Action Committee met to discuss recent and expected 
demonstrations within metropolitan Khartoum and the attack on 
AmEmbassy Damascus and its ramifications for Embassy 
Khartoum. End Summary. 
 
¶2.     On September 12 a small demonstration was held to 
object to UNSC Resolution 1706 and to protest the proposal to 
place UN Peacekeepers in Darfur.  It was a small 
demonstration, organized by the GNU and it marched from city 
center to the UN Headquarters building, and then shortly 
dispersed. There was no significant impact on the Embassy or 
its personnel. 
¶3.     Information received by the RSO stated that another 
demonstration against GNU economic policies and the rise in 
prices of basic commodities would occur on September 13.  RSO 
advised the EAC that as information about this possible 
demonstration developed, it would be made available to the 
Embassy community.  As it turned out, there was no 
demonstration. 
 
¶4.   EAC discussed the attack on Embassy Damascus.  RSO 
deployed Charge,/DCM bodyguards to the CACs and PACs to 
increase the number of armed security personnel at these 
vulnerable locations.  Agencies/Sections with contacts in the 
GNU and the local community will ask about, but pending 
additional information that is Khartoum specific, the EAC 
agreed with the RSO,s assessment that we hold for the time 
being on any significant changes in security 
posture/procedures.
