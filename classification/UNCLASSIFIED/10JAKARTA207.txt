VISIT TO WASHINGTON

1.(U)  Irman Gusman, Speaker of the Regional Representatives 
Assembly (DPD) told DCM on February 17 that he wanted to lead 
a ten-person delegation to Capital Hill in June.  Gusman 
stated that the delegation would likely include 
representatives from Papua and Aceh and Foreign Affairs 
officials.  Gusman explained that while his predecessor had 
focused on expanding ties with Australia and Japan, he wants 
to focus on strengthening Indonesia's relationship with the 
United States. (Note: Gusman has an MBA from the University 
of Bridgeport, and his daughter attends high school in New 
York.) 
 
FIRST OFFICIAL VISIT OF DPD SPEAKER TO THE U.S. 
 
2.(U)  This would be the first official visit of a DPD 
Speaker to the United States.  During his visit, Gusman would 
seek closer cooperation and exchanges with both the Senate 
and the House, and learn how Capitol Hill works. Gusman 
pointed out that the visit would follw an expected agreement 
in March to pursue a comprehensive partnership between the 
U.S. and Indonesia. (Note: Although the DPD is structurally 
like the Senate as the "upper house" of Indonesia's 
legislative branch whose provincial representatives are 
directly elected, it serves as a consultative body on 
regional affairs and does not create or vote on legislation.) 
 Gusman's agenda would include discussing the role of the 
legislature in Indonesia's transition from dictatorship to 
democracy and deepening and strengthening the comprehensive 
partnership. 
 
REQUEST FOR PRESIDENT TO MEET LEGISLATIVE LEADERS 
 
3.(U)  Gusman urged the DCM to ask Washington for a meeting 
between President Obama and Indonesia's legislative leaders 
during the President's much-anticipated late March visit. 
Gusman pointed out that the leaders of India, Brazil, and 
other countries had met with the leaders during their visits 
to Jakarta.  Gusman maintained that "it would not sit well 
with Indonesians if the U.S. just met with the palace.  That 
would be like during Suharto times.  The palace is the symbol 
of power, the parliament is the symbol of democracy."  DCM 
said the Embassy welcomed the opportunity to facilitate his 
delegation's visit to Washington.
