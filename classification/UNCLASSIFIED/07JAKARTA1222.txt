Â¶1. Embassy contacted Indonesian Air Force (IAF) Aircraft 
Transportation Division Lieutenant, Colonel Amin Sulaksono on March 
14 to verify reftel transaction.  Sulaksono is not familiar with the 
foreign party, Singapore Precision Repair and Overhaul (S-PRO). 
Embassy also contacted First Air Marshall Sunaryo, Chief of 
Aeronautics on the same day to verify reftel transaction.  He was 
also not familiar with S-PRO.  The majority of IAF supply 
transactions utilize an Indonesia-based company which in turn 
contracts with foreign suppliers.  It may be that S-PRO is 
purchasing parts on behalf of an Indonesian firm which is a 
registered IAF supplier.  Unfortunately, the IAF is unable to 
identify a local company with a supply order as detailed in reftel.
