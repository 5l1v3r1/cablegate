¶1. (U) Summary: On the eve of the presidential election in 
Puntland, observers tell us that General Abdullahi Ahmed Jama 
is the front-runner.  The electoral commission very belatedly 
announced on January 6 a series of registration criteria for 
candidates.  The electioneering, it is rumored, has been 
driven in part by payments to the MPs who will be doing the 
voting.  End summary.

The Front Runner 
---------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Observers of the Puntland presidential election, which 
is scheduled for January 8, report the election process has 
gone relatively smoothly to date. Reports indicate that 
General Abdullahi Ahmed Jama is the current front-runner, 
although the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty, as 
it hinges on the votes of only 66 bribery-susceptible MPs. 
Jama, an American citizen and former General during the Siad 
Barre regime, is rumored to have close relations with 
recently-resigned Transitional Federal Government President 
Abdullahi Yusuf.  Among the other strong candidates at this 
stage are incumbent Mohamed Muse Hersi, as well as Abdirahman 
Mohamed Faroole, and Ali Abdi Aware. 
 
---------------------- 
Criteria for Candidacy 
---------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) On January 6, the election commission belatedly 
announced a series of requirements for candidates for the 
presidency and vice presidency.  Among them are: 
 
-- a qualification fee of $5000 for presidential candidates 
and $2500 for vice-presidential candidates. One contact 
guessed that some of this money would be used to fund 
security for the elections, with the remainder going to 
"administrative expenses." 
 
-- a resume, to be submitted by January 6. 
 
-- a workplan, to be submitted by January 7. 
 
¶4. (U) We are told that the nine remaining candidates met all 
of the conditions. Four candidates for Vice President also 
fulfilled the requirements. (See reftel for thumbnail bios of 
candidates.) 
 
--------------------- 
Security Situation 
Drives MPs' Decisions 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Many of the 66 MPs who will vote by secret ballot on 
January 8 have set up elaborate mechanisms for receipt of 
bribes from the candidates, we are told.  Several candidates 
have set up offshore accounts through which they have 
allegedly moved money to the MPs who will determine the 
outcome.  However, one source told us that the worsening 
security situation in Puntland, not bribes, will in fact 
determine many MPs' votes in this race.
