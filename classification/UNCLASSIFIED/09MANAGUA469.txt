¶2. (U) BEGIN OF UNOFFICIAL ENGLISH TRANSLATION 
 
Ministry of Foreign Relations 
Republic of Nicaragua 
 
MRE/0050/05/09 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Nicaragua - 
Office of North America - presents its compliments to the Honorable 
Embassy of the United States of America, and makes reference to 
document published by the Department of State on April 30 of the 
present year as "2008 Country Report on Terrorism." 
 
On this point, this Ministry clarifies that although this report 
includes Nicaragua, it does not link our country to terrorism in any 
sense.  Nicaragua has its own points of view regarding the conduct 
of the government of the United States at the international level; 
however, being respectful of the states' sovereignty, it abstains 
from expressing its criticism.  Nicaragua rejects all reports or 
declarations which seek to link Nicaragua with terrorism.  On the 
contrary, its political will to fight this scourge is evident by 
being a member-State of all international legal instruments before 
the United Nations and the Inter-American covenants on this subject, 
as well as participating diligently in activities of the 
Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (CICTE, Acronym in 
Spanish). 
 
In the same manner, Nicaragua rejects the opinions given in the 
report regarding the performance of its judicial system and other 
national institutions; these value judgments should rest solely with 
national authorities as they affect internal affairs and the 
exercise of national sovereignty and self-determination, as well as 
the right to establish and maintain diplomatic relations with all 
the countries of the world, without exception. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Nicaragua - 
Office for North America - avails itself of this opportunity to 
renew to the Honorable Embassy of the United States the assurance of 
its highest consideration. 
 
Managua, May 4, 2009

Embassy of the United States of America
