Post contacted Engineer Zahwa Al Kuwari, Director of the 
Environment Assessment and Planning Directorate, General 
Commission for the Protection of Marine Resources, 
Environment, and Wildlife, to discuss reftel.  Kuwari said 
Bahrain is not a party to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety 
and does not plan to become a member in the coming year. 
Furthermore, GOB representatives will not be attending the 
meeting in Montreal, Canada May - June 2005.  When asked what 
if anything Bahrain is doing in terms of biosafety, Kuwari 
stated the GOB is not doing anything at this time as its 
priority is to strengthen compliance with existing 
conventions.
