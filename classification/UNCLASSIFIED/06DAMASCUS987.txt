¶1.  Summary: 
 
Syrian newspapers highlighted statements by F.M. Walid al- 
Mo'allem during the Arab League's ministerial meeting that Syria 
has reached a "good understanding" with the International 
Investigation Committee. Papers also highlighted the meeting in 
Damascus of the Arab Parties Conference and the address to the 
Conference by Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal, who said that Hamas 
would combine political work with resistance. 
 
Ezeddin al-Darwish editorialized in Tishreen that Arabs are 
suffering from the American occupation of Arab territories and 
its support of Israel and from American labeling of anyone who 
opposes U.S. policies as undemocratic and terrorist, while those 
who call Israel a friend are promoted to the rank of zealous 
democrats and true nationalists and are invited to the White 
House, a clear reference to the Lebanese politician Walid 
Jumblat.

¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
------------------------------------ 
"Has Bush Asked: Why?" 
------------------------------------ 
Ezzedin al-Darwish, an editorialist in government-owned Tishreen, 
wrote (3/6): "Massive demonstrations, protests, acts of violence, 
closure of cities, curfews, deaths and injuries-- all of this 
takes place wherever President Bush visits and this was clear in 
his visits to India, Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
 
"It is not confined to this country or that, as everyone is 
harmed by the Bush Administration policies and positions that are 
dedicated to the service of international Zionism and to fight 
Arabs and Muslims under the banner of combating terrorism. 
 
"In the Arab region the Bush Administration wants to occupy, 
infringe on national sovereignty, kill, directly or through 
Israel, and instigate sectarianism, and if anyone says no, then 
he is labeled a terrorist or undemocratic, and he should be 
 
fought politically, economically and even militarily.... 
 
"It is enough that someone Walid Jumblat say that Israel is not 
an enemy and the national resistance is an enemy, for the gates 
of the White House and the State Department to open before him 
and for him to be labeled a traditional democrat and a first 
 
class nationalist. 
 
"The Arabs are truly suffering from the Bush Administration's 
policies; they are suffering direct American occupation, 
unlimited support for the Israeli occupation, interference in the 
internal affairs of more than one Arab country and deliberate 
provocations to this country or that, all leading to popular and 
official anger that is manifested in various forms. 
 
"Did President Bush ask himself, when he toured Asian and Islamic 
countries recently, what procedures should be taken to improve 
America's image in the Arab and Islamic worlds?"
