(SBU)  German MFA nuclear energy desk officer Joerg Polster 
welcomed information contained in Ref A emails, particularly 
the details regarding the amount, enrichment level and 
isotopes involved in the subject material.  Polster said this 
information should allow the German Ministry of Environment 
specifically and the GOG interagency generally to proceed 
with the application review process.  He did not offer a 
substantive reason for the GOG delay, nor could he say when 
the review process would be complete.
