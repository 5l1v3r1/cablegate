¶2. BEGIN TEXT: 
 
03 April 2009 
 
Your Excellency, 
 
I refer to your letter of 24 March 2009 proposing the Major 
Economies Forum on Energy and Climate to continue the work of 
the existing Major Economies initiative. 
 
I support your proposal and South Africa will continue to 
participate in this forum to support the formal negotiations 
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC). 
 
I also believe that a candid dialogue may assist the formal 
negotiations and facilitate a better understanding between 
some of the key countries in the negotiations.  South Africa 
will therefore attend the proposed Heads of State Meeting in 
July that will follow the G8 5 Heads of State Meeting. 
 
My Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Minister 
Marthinus van Schalkwyk, will continue to represent me in the 
preparatory sessions. 
 
I also look forward to working with you on this issue.  South 
Africa strongly believes that a global agreement is possible 
and we will work with all other countries to achieve that. 
 
Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
/s/ 
Kgalema Motlanthe
