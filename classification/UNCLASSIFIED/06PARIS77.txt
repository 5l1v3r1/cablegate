EXECUTIVE BOARD ROTATION 
 
 
¶1.  Mission received a message today from the French 
delegation (new chair of Electoral Group I) convening a 
meeting on January 16 to discuss Executive Board 
rotation.  The meeting is an outgrowth of the General 
Conference resolution (33/RES/92) that invites the 
President of the General Conference to consult the 
different regional groups about Executive Board 
rotation.  According to the letter, the chairs of the 
various electoral groups met in December and are due to 
meet again at the end of January at which time the 
various groups will be expected to make proposals. 
 
¶2.  Please provide guidance.
