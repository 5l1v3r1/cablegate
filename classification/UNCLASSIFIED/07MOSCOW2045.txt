BOCHVAR ALL-RUSSIAN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR 
INORGANIC MATERIALS (VNIINM), MOSCOW, RUSSIA - D297986 
 
REFTEL: 1. 04 USDOC 04284 
 
¶2. 05 MOSCOW 14902 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Bochvar All-Russian Scientific Research 
Institute for Inorganic Materials (VNIINM), Moscow, 
Russia. The company was listed on BIS license number: 
D297986 as the ultimate consignee of germanium coaxial 
detector, digital spectrum, digital spectrum analyzer, 
genie 2000 input software, shield neutron assay probe, 
power supply for jsp-12, 50 ohm cable, 50 ohm cable, 
bnc tee, bnc terminator, ECCN: 1A999. These items are 
controlled for anti-terrorism reasons. The licensee is 
Canberra Industries, Inc., 800 Research Parkway, 
Meriden CT 06450.  Reftel 2 is an unfavorable 
recommendation citing the refusal of the GOR to grant 
access to the facility in order for ECO Moscow to 
conduct the end use check. 
 
¶3. NOTE: Bochvar All-Russian Scientific Research 
Institute for Inorganic Materials (Russian acronym 
VNIINM) conducts research on nuclear fuel cycle 
technologies and fissile material processing.  The 
Government of Russia (GOR) Ministry of Atomic Energy 
(Russian acronym MINATOM) still classifies VNIINM as a 
"closed facility."  Foreigners are generally not 
granted access to closed facilities, however, a 
bilateral agreement between the US Department of 
Energy (DOE) and MINATOM allows for site visits by DOE 
personnel for information exchange and audit purposes. 
DOE and VNIINM have been working on collaborative 
projects since 1992.  END NOTE. 
 
¶4. On March 20, 2007 ECO Pearce participated in a DOE 
teleconference with Mark Shuler, Technical Contractor, 
National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA). Mr. 
Shuler and his team were scheduled to visit the VNIINM 
facilities as part of a DOE Threat Reduction and 
Safeguards project assessment. ECO Pearce gave Mr. 
Elmont a briefing on conducting BIS end use checks, 
and the specific commodities to be verified, including 
descriptions of the devices and the locations of 
number plates.  Mr. Shuler stated that he and Mr. 
Phillip Gibbs would be conducting the check on April 
17, 2007 
 
¶5. On April 18, 2007 ECO Pearce received an email from 
Mr. Shuler with photographs and a narrative attached. 
Paragraphs 6 and 7 summarize the information provided. 
The original email and photographs are available from 
post upon request. 
 
¶6. On April 17, 2007 an NNSA team consisting of 
Messrs. Shuler and Gibbs were granted access to the 
VNIINM site. The team confirmed that the equipment in 
reftel 1 is located at Building B5 on the second floor 
in room 225. According to officials at VNIINM, the 
equipment was obtained to determine the Plutonium 
content in certain materials, specifically as a method 
to promote the Plutonium Disposition (PD) program. Due 
to the fact that the PD program has had limited 
opportunities to work, the equipment has never been 
used.   The team was shown a model GC3518 germanium 
coaxial detector, serial #09027523, a 97-3803 "CITS" 
analyzer and assay probe.  The serial number on the 
probe can only be obtained by taking apart the tubs, 
which the team did not request due to the technical 
nature of the equipment. 
 
¶7. The team observed other U.S. origin equipment in 
room 225 that Gibbs believes was provided by DOE. 
Mr. Shuler believes a team could conduct a check in 
fairly short order depending on the size of the site 
and number of units. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends Bochvar All- 
Russian Scientific Research Institute For Inorganic 
Materials (VNIINM) as a reliable recipient of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
