¶1.  We raised the points contained reftels with Olga 
Rozsivalova, head of the ILO department in the Ministry of 
Labor and Social Affairs, who will attend the ILO Labor 
Conference May 31-June 16 in Geneva as the Czech Republic's 
representative. 
 
¶2.  Regarding Cuba's and Barbados's candidacies for the ILO 
Governing Body (ref A), Rozcivalova said that she had 
consulted the issue with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and 
agreed with the MFA that the Czech Republic would support 
Barbados if asked to vote on the matter.  The Czech position 
is consistent with its support for democracy in Cuba in other 
international fora. 
 
¶3.  Regarding adding restraint to the ILO budget (ref B), 
Rozcivalova said that the Czech Republic supports budget 
cuts, but not at the expense of actual regional programs. 
She said that zero nominal growth in the ILO budget, a goal 
the Czech Republic supports, will inevitably require some 
cuts in non-program expenditures.
