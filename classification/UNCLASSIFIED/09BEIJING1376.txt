  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"Hacking military computers 'not a hack job'" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (05/21): "There 
is no way hackers - including those from China - can access 
top-secret data by penetrating the firewalls of military or 
government networks.  The US military is picking on China because it 
wants to make its claims appear more plausible.  The Former Director 
of [China's] National Computer Network Emergency Response Team said 
that there is no scientific basis to blame either China's military 
or the government for hacking other nations' networks because most 
of them are "out of reach."  The foreign media, quoting insiders in 
overseas intelligence services, have recently claimed that hackers, 
who appeared to be based in China, had repeatedly infiltrated 
military networks and government computers in more than 100 
countries. "If there had been cases of key intelligence being 
stolen, I believe there would have been undercover agents within the 
organizations facilitating the theft.  You cannot simply do it with 
computer technology," he said." 
 
¶2. U.S. POLICY 
 
"Stop the duplicity and give China a break" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (05/21): "The 
term "group of two" or (G2, that is, the U.S. and China) is the 
subject of debate because the two countries have the greatest 
influence on international affairs, and have the ability to help the 
world emerge out of the economic crisis. But the aspects that 
deserve greater attention are the responsibility the two countries 
show in facing global threats, presenting ideals, and leading the 
rest of the world pursuing those ideals.  What Obama means by a 
nuclear-free world is a peaceful and safe world. Hu's goal is clear: 
long term peace and common prosperity. To realize their goals, the 
two countries have to communicate and cooperate to the maximum 
level, for if they fail to do so, their ideas will prove to be 
utopian.  We need mutual respect, have to treat each other as 
equals, and respect the right of a nation to choose its social 
system and development mode. In short, countries should be 
"harmonious but different". 
 
¶3. A/H1N1 
 
"Transparency key to anti-virus battle" 
 
Global Times English (English-language daily published by the 
People's Daily) (05/21): "According to foreign reports, under 
pressure from Japan, Britain, China and other nations, the World 
Health Organization (WHO) decided not to raise the alert level from 
the current phase 5 to phase 6, which would mean a global outbreak 
is " imminent. "  One of our reporters contacted China's Ministry of 
Health hoping to confirm the story but was rebuffed by an official. 
Why aren't official departments more open on releasing this 
information?  Why can't the Chinese people learn critical 
information from the Chinese media?  Why must Chinese media receive 
such information from the foreign media rather than from our own 
government?  But as efforts to contain the virus drag on, Chinese 
people need more details, both about domestic and international 
developments.  Providing a greater level of transparency on 
information critical to the welfare of citizens goes a long way in 
building social stability and mutual trust between governments and 
the people in any country.  In China, we need such mutual trust to 
help us overcome the H1N1 virus."
