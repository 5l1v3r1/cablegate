SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN POST-SHIPMENT END USE CHECK ON 
LICENSE GC 109608 
 
¶1.  This is an action message.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2.  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post assistance in conducting a 
post-shipment check for the export of T100 gyroscopes to 
Vietnam via France.  Post is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3.  Reason for request: the Foreign End User, Southern 
Service Flight Company (SSFC), has no licensing history with 
our office.  SSFC has purchased a Super Puma AS332L2 
helicopter from French company Eurocopter.  The AS332L2 uses 
an Attitude and Heading Reference System which integrates two 
T100 gyroscopes.  The gyroscopes are United States Munitions 
List (USML) items that are export-controlled because they 
have military applications. 
 
¶4.  ACTION: Please contact the Foreign End User, SSFC, and 
speak with its Director, Nguyen Duc Hoa.  Confirm purchase of 
the Super Puma AS332L2 helicopter and date of delivery to 
SSFC.  Inquire with SSFC about intended use of the 
helicopter.  Will it only be used for civilian transport 
purposes?  Also, will the helicopter be equipped with 
weapons?  Finally, ask SSFC if it understands the 
restrictions on USML commodities, particularly the 
prohibition against re-transfers or re-exports without 
express USG authorization.  END ACTION.

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: 
 
The T100 gyros were exported from the U.S. to France for 
integration into Eurocopter Super Puma AS332L2 helicopters 
which uses an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) 
for piloting assistance.  The AHRS integrates two T100 gyros 
and three accelerometers, which together provide primary 
references, i.e., pitch, roll, heading, speed and altitude. 
One Super Puma AS332L2 helicopter containing two T100 gyros 
has been sold to Southern Service Flight Company (SSFC).  The 
aircraft will be dedicated to civil transportation from 
ground base to offshore platforms of company personnel 
working in petrol extraction operations, with no cross-border 
use.  The aircraft and their maintenance will remain under 
permanent, complete, and effective control of SSFC.
