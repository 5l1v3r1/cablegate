Dear Press Members, 
Respectable People of Diyarbakir, 
 
The events that have occurred in the past one week in the region 
and in the past two days in our city have reached dimensions 
that would seriously damage our peoples' desire and willpower 
for cohabitation.  The city is tense, anxieties are high. Under 
current circumstances, a democratic and common sense approach is 
more urgent than at any time. 
 
We believe that all these things being experienced are stemming 
from the lack of a lasting and peaceful solution to the Kurdish 
issue. The current oppressive approaches, which are dominated by 
security perspectives, have unfortunately been dragging the 
chances for a peaceful solution of the Kurdish issue and 
democratization into a situation where no solutions are being 
offered. (literally: a no-solution policy). Many people have 
been wounded with firearms as a result of the security forces' 
intervention in the demonstrations which have been staged here, 
and two persons have lost their lives as of now. There are 
wounded people who are still facing death. Again, many 
businesses and common areas in the city have been damaged. 
Everybody, particularly the Government, should approach the 
issue in a civil and common sense manner and take responsibility 
immediately. 
 
A comprehensive, wide-spread civil and democratic struggle 
against the imposed no-solution policy is required. For this 
reason, while demanding democratic rights and freedoms, the 
methods to be used in the struggle should also be democratic to 
prevent incurring further oppressive waves. Any further mounting 
reactions should be of the nature that would contribute to a 
democratic and peaceful solution of these problems. 
 
As a city, our grief is great, and with every passing second, we 
are facing risks that would increase our bitterness. We 
understand the concerns of the people and share their grief. 
Under current circumstances, in order not to suffer more grief 
and damages, we invite everybody to show common sense and 
fortitude, and contribute to the normalization of daily life.
