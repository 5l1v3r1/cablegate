SUBJECT: Toronto Tamil Community Presents Letter of Concern 
 
¶1. (U) During a March 3 Tamil protest in front of U.S. Consulate 
General Toronto, a representative of the Tamil community asked to 
meet the Consul General to present a letter of concern about Tamils 
in Sri Lanka.  Due to the ongoing protest (which remained peaceful), 
and the fact that some members of the crowd of 600-700 were waving 
flags of "Tamil Eelam," the CG declined to meet them or accept the 
letter, but agreed to accept a letter from a Tamil community 
representative on a different day. 
 
¶2. (U) Two members of the Tamil community presented the letter to 
the Consul General and a PolOff at the Consulate on March 6. They 
expressed their group's concerns regarding the conflict in Sri Lanka 
and what they call a "genocide."  The letter, which is addressed to 
President Obama, requests USG intervention.  We took the letter and 
said we would forward it to Washington, noting that the United 
States also supports peace in Sri Lanka, but that the Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), an internationally designated 
terrorist group, has a long history of terrorism and mistreating 
civilians, including using them as hostages, and should lay down its 
arms.  The meeting lasted about 15 minutes. 
 
¶3. (U) We are faxing the letter to the SCA/INS for the Sri Lanka 
desk officer and to WHA/CAN.  No reply to the letter was promised or 
implied.
