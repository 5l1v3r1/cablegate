¶2.  Auer said she would coordinate with her colleagues in the 
Defense Ministry and in law enforcement agencies to determine 
who would attend the Hamburg meeting of the Proliferation 
Security Initiative (PSI) Regional Operational Experts Group 
(ROEG).  She said she was unaware that anyone in the Austrian 
government had received an invitation, but she had recently 
received information from the German government concerning 
the Hamburg event. 
 
¶3.  Auer noted that experts often receive word of PSI 
activities at short notice, making it difficult to respond 
adequately.  She suggested that a half-year is not too far in 
advance to plan operational activities.
