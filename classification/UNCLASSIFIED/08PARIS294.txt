SUBJECT: FRANCE SUPPORTS UNSCR ON THE FDLR 
 
REF: STATE 16195 
 
MFA DAS-equivalent for East and Central Africa Helene Le Gal 
said on February 19 that France would support a UNSC 
Resolution on the FDLR, as proposed reftel.  She said that 
the French UN delegation would work with U.S. and other SC 
counterparts to "fine tune" the language.  She said that she 
had been aware that such a project was in the works, and that 
France supported it and would work to see that an acceptable 
final draft is available for UNSC adoption.
