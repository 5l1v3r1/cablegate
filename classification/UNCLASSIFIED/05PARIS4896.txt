REF: STATE 127710 
 
(SBU) On July 11, poloff contacted Renaud Salins, desk 
officer for Iraq at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to 
deliver reftel demarche on the next meeting of the 
International Reconstruction Trust Fund Facility for Iraq 
July 18-19 in Jordan.  Salins said the GOF would send a 
three-person delegation, led by Philippe Coste, the GOF's 
envoy for Iraq reconstruction issues.  France had no plans on 
increasing the amount of its previously announced 
contributions, said Salins, especially given the GOF's belief 
that Iraq was already having trouble digesting the existing 
amount of aid.  At the meeting, the French delegation was 
most interested in hearing from the Iraqis about the 
implementation of new mechanisms for coordinating aid 
assistance, said Salins.
