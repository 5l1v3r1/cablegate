REF: A. Jakarta 3897; B. Jakarta 8114 
 
¶1.  This cable amends Embassy Jakarta's FY2006 Intellectual 
Property Rights (IPR) project proposal for INL Bureau 
funding contained in ref A.  We continue to support our 
initial request of USD 356,000 to fund one senior technical 
advisor for a second and final year.  In addition, we now 
request USD 100,000 to support IPR programming for our 
incoming resident legal advisor (RLA) arriving in August 
¶2006.  The new RLA has considerable IPR case experience and 
will include engaging the Government of Indonesia (GOI) on 
IPR enforcement among his formal responsibilities. 
 
¶2.  As ref B notes, cooperation between police and 
prosecutors on IPR cases remains weak.   Police complain 
that once they send cases to the Attorney General's Office 
(AGO), it is often very difficult to obtain information on 
their outcomes.  Meanwhile, prosecutors complain that, while 
police have recently referred many IPR-related case files to 
the AGO, police cases are often poorly investigated, lack 
sufficient evidence, or are intended to to boost police 
arrest numbers and impress superiors.  During a recent visit 
by one USTR official (ref B), senior police and AGO 
officials welcomed the idea of U.S.-supported joint 
workshops with the police, AGO and courts on IPR evidence 
collection, investigations and prosecutions as a means to 
promote better collaboration and cooperation on IPR cases. 
 
¶3.  We propose five separate workshops for 25-35 police, 
prosecutors and judges held in the cities of Jakarta, 
Semarang, Surabaya, Makasar and Medan.  These cities contain 
major shipping ports and are natural entry points for pirate 
and counterfeit goods from overseas.  They also each house 
one of Indonesia's five commercial courts, which have 
purview over civil IPR cases.  The workshops would run 
roughly three days and rely entirely on local expertise, 
such as Embassy's RLA and two DOJ ICITAP IPR senior 
technical advisors assisting the GOI on optical disc 
regulation implementation and police IPR enforcement. 
Tapping other existing local IPR industry representatives 
and experts, we believe an effective series of workshops 
could be developed and executed with a cost of approximately 
USD 20,000 each.  Our cost estimate is based on USAID's 
experience conducting similar size workshops using locally 
available lecturers and includes: hotel venue; translation 
and interpretation; travel, per diem and lodging for 
speakers; audio visual equipment; and miscellaneous other 
expenses. 
 
¶4.  Embassy Jakarta welcomes this opportunity to amend its 
INL IPR funding requests and looks forward to INL Bureau's 
decision.
