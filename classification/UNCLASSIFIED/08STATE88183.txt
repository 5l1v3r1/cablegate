SUBJECT: INSTRUCTIONS FOR UNMIS CONSULTATIONS IN SECURITY 
COUNCIL 
 
Â¶1.  In the August 18 Security Counsultations on UNMIS, USUN 
may draw on the following points for discussions in the 
Council: 
 
The United States thanks the Secretary General for this 
report.  We agree with the Secretary-General,s assessment 
that full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement 
is the cornerstone of any durable settlement in Sudan, and is 
essential to end the suffering of the Sudanese people.  For 
this reason, we wholeheartedly support the efforts of the 
UNMIS operation to assist the Northern and Southern portions 
of Sudan in implementing the CPA.  Today, I would first like 
to discuss our deep concern at the recent outbreaks of 
conflict that threaten the peace process, and urge the 
parties to make every effort to seek reconciliation. 
Second, I would like to discuss UNMIS, role in mitigating 
the outbreak of fighting in Abyei and assisting with the 
implementation of the June 8 Road Map on Abyei, and urge that 
UNMIS continue to draw on the lessons learned in this episode 
to further improve its operations.  Finally, I would like to 
welcome the progress that has been made in implementing the 
CPA, through the conduct of the census, the preparations for 
the 2009 elections and continued wealth sharing. 
 
First, the United States is deeply troubled by the violent 
skirmishes in recent months between the Sudan Armed Forces 
(SAF) and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) that have 
threatened the hard-won peace process between North and 
South.  Last May,s conflict in Abyei posed a clear danger to 
the peace process established by the CPA.  We welcome the 
June 8 Road Map, and urge the parties to the Abyei conflict 
to act promptly to implement its terms.  In particular we 
urge the parties to reach agreement on an appropriate interim 
administration for Abyei.   The parties must take steps, with 
UNMIS assistance to resolve the underlying causes of the 
Abyei conflict, if further conflict is to be averted. 
 
Second, we wish to express our appreciation for the efforts 
of UNMIS, including actions to mediate between the parties, 
and to ensure the safety of civilians and humanitarian 
workers.  We also commend UNMIS, efforts to urge the parties 
to facilitate UNMIS its freedom of movement in this endeavor. 
  The troubling episode in Abyei conflict and its aftermath 
present the opportunity for lessons learned, and we welcome 
the efforts of UNMIS to review its response to the crisis and 
to assess force levels in Abyei.  We urge UNMIS to take steps 
so that in any future crisis, it is prepared to do the utmost 
within its capabilities and mandate to defuse any future 
crisis and mitigate its effects. 
 
Finally, we acknowledge the significant progress that has 
been made this quarter in implementing the Comprehensive 
Peace Process.  As acknowledged by the Assessment and 
Evaluation Commission's (AEC) Midterm Review, much of the CPA 
is being implemented.  We welcome these efforts, and urge the 
parties to continue and renew their commitment to 
implementing the CPA, with UNMIS, assistance.   We welcome 
the successful conclusion of the fifth national census and we 
welcome the adoption of the Electoral Law on July 14.  We 
urge the Government of Sudan to continue to take the steps 
mandated in the CPA toward the preparation of the 2009 
elections.  We also welcome the establishment of Joint 
Integrated Units (JIUs) in accordance with the CPA and also 
in fulfillment of the terms of the June 8 Road Map on Abyei. 
We urge all parties to redouble their efforts in this area, 
with the assistance of UNMIS.
