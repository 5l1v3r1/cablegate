SUBJECT: AF: Update on USG Energy Projects. 
 
¶1. (U) The following cable provides a current status update on USG 
energy sector projects in Afghanistan. 
 
¶2. (U) KABUL 100 MW GENERATOR SETS (GENSETS) - Delivery of the first 
six (of total 18) generators for the project is expected in May 
¶2008.  While progress is on track with manufacturing, we are 
watching delivery logistics closely.  Contractor Louis Berger 
Group/Black & Veitch (LBG/B&V) is finalizing transportation 
arrangements and USAID is working with them to ensure the project 
does not fall behind schedule.  Per the agreement reached when the 
project began, the IRoA has transferred USD 10 million, half of its 
total contribution to the project, to the U.S. Treasury.  The second 
USD 10 million payment is due in April 2008. 
 
¶2. (U) North East Power System (NEPS) - UZBEK COMPONENT -  Following 
two successful visits by IRoA officials in December 2007 and January 
2008, a third visit took place February 4 - 10, 2008.  As of 
February 21, the Ministry of Economy reported that the Uzbeks and 
Afghans have agreed upon a USD 12.5 million price tag for the 
construction of 43 km of 220 kv line within Uzbekistan to link the 
two power systems as well as the upgrade of the Surkhan substation 
located on their shared border.  The IRoA will fund the project in 
order to facilitate power imports in October 2008.  DABM, the Afghan 
national power utility, will sign the construction contract with 
Uzbekenergo, the Uzbek power utility, once the project is ratified 
by the Uzbek Cabinet.  Ratification is expected shortly.  This will 
be followed by a second negotiation to finalize and sign a Power 
Purchase Agreement (PPA) for long-term (20 year) imports of 150 MW 
of power, expected to rise to 300 MW within the next three years. 
Although Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) officials tell us the 
basics of the PPA have been agreed, a formal negotiation, followed 
by Uzbek Cabinet ratification is expected to take several months. 
 
¶3. (U) Two components essential to the successful functioning of the 
NEPS system, Reactive Power Compensation (RPC) and a National Load 
Dispatch and Control Center (NLDCC) are also proceeding apace. 
Although full RPC implementation is expected to take over 12 months, 
the portion of the RPC needed to successfully receive Uzbek power 
will be completed by October/November 2008.  The NLDCC is expected 
to be completed in 24 months (March 2010), however interim 
provisions for communications and protection of the NEPS 
transmission lines (particularly the Uzbek line) are being prepared 
to ensure proper function once imports begin in late 2008. 
 
¶4. (U) NEPS - TAJIK AND TURKMEN COMPONENTS - Although the MEW plans 
to send delegations to both nations over then next few months to 
begin PPA discussions, no other significant developments have 
occurred.  Both nations continue to indicate a willingness to sell 
available power and financing and construction timelines remain 
under discussion. 
 
¶5. (U) SHEBERGHAN GAS FIELD TESTING - Although the contract for 
mobilization to the site was signed February 6, there have been some 
delays as the bidder subsequently increased his price for the 
mobilization and testing work.  The project was then awarded to the 
second bidder and is expected to be finalized in mid-March.  Unlike 
the 100 days for mobilization for the first bidder, the second 
bidder is expected to take only 30 days to mobilize into the field, 
keeping the late June timeline for initial well test results on 
track. 
 
¶6. (U) South East Power System (SEPS) - Security problems persist in 
the Kajaki Dam area but some progress is being made.  Parts delivery 
via helicopter airlift was completed.  This will enable work on 
Turbine 3 to proceed.  Negotiations are underway with the 
subcontractor to add additional shifts and complete work earlier 
than previously scheduled thereby minimizing the time the turbine 
must be off-line.  Additional personnel are expected at the site in 
mid March.  This too is expected to increase the pace and cost of 
 
turbine rehabilitation.  Delivery of Turbine 2 to the site remains 
problematic.  Its heavy components can not be air lifted; hence land 
transport must be arranged.  The security situation continues to 
preclude regular delivery by a subcontractor although we continue to 
explore ways to facilitate such a move. 
 
¶7. (U) DABM COMMERCIALIZATION - please refer to KABUL 0516 for 
further information.
