SUBJECT:  SUDAN/DARFUR:  Update on Security and 
Humanitarian Access - June 14, 2006 
 
¶1.  Overview: 
 
UNDSS reports that over the past two weeks there has been 
a notable reduction in clashes between the parties to the 
Darfur conflict.  However, UNDSS observed that inter-SLA 
conflicts have been on the rise, especially in areas to 
the north of Kutum in North Darfur State. 
 
Our assessment is that low-level violence is likely to 
continue, particularly between SLA factions to gain 
influence and territory and related to banditry.  Larger- 
scale attacks are also possible, in part due to jinjaweed 
apprehension due to pending disarmament.  In terms of 
humanitarian programs, most attacks take place to rob 
vehicles and communications equipment; there has been 
relatively little theft of food or other relief 
commodities. 
 
¶2.  Security incidents: 
 
¶A.  On June 14, 2006, early morning, INGOs and UN 
agencies reported heavy fighting in and around Korma 
town, located 70 km northwest of El Fasher.  While only 
the SLA is present in the area, no one could confirm the 
SLA factions involved.  UNDSS declared the area a "no go" 
zone, and all INGOs have been requested to suspend their 
activities in the area. 
 
¶B.  On June 14, UNDSS reports that five international 
organization staff (one international and four national) 
went missing on June 13 in the Kutum area.  UNDSS will 
not disclose the name of the specific agency involved, 
although other sources indicate it is the IOM.  UNDSS 
officials flew to Kutum on June 14 to investigate. 
 
¶C.  On June 13, SLA/Minawi forces and the breakaway 
SLA/Minawi faction known as the "Group 19" fought 
intensely in villages around Kulkul. 
 
¶D.  On the night of June 12-13, four armed men wearing 
military uniforms attacked the UNHCR office in Habillah, 
West Darfur.  In the brief raid, according to both UNHCR 
and UNDSS, the assailants shot a guard in the leg and 
stole a Thuraya phone and a laptop computer from the 
office. 
 
¶E.  On June 12, mission DoD personnel received 
preliminary reports of ongoing fighting between members 
of the Mini Minawi and the Abdel Wahid SLM factions 
northwest of Kutum, North Darfur State.  No details are 
yet available. 
 
¶3.  Humanitarian Access Update: 
 
On June 8, an UNMIS human rights team visited Muzbat in 
an effort to meet Sulayman Jamus and assess his detention 
conditions.  The SLA/Mini Minawi faction field commander 
met the team and chaired a meeting with SLA leaders in 
the area.  SLA told the UNMIS human rights team that 
Jamus had been moved to another location for security 
reasons, and stated that the team would have to come back 
to meet with him on another day.
