SUBJECT: PREVAL ANNOUNCES HAITI TO JOIN PETROCARIBE 
 
REF: A. 05 PAP 2720 
     ¶B. 05 PAP 2596 
 
¶1.  President-elect Preval announced to the press April 18 
that Haiti will soon join Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's 
energy initiative, PetroCaribe.  Preval made the announcement 
after returning from a five-day trip to Cuba, where he 
discussed the subject of Petrocaribe with the Venezuelan 
Ambassador to Cuba.  Preval's economic advisor Gabriel Verret 
confirmed Preval's intention to Post, but said that Preval is 
not aware of the constraints and the problems that need to be 
addressed before Haiti can receive preferential oil rates. 
Verret said that they will need a state-owned oil company, 
which the country does not currently have, as an example of 
one obstacle. 
 
¶2.  Comment: President-elect Preval has emphasized the 
importance of showing his supporters immediate improvements 
following his inauguration.  Given the recent rise in oil 
prices and the lack of electricity in Port-au-Prince, Preval 
is under pressure to join PetroCaribe.  By announcing his 
intention to join, he shows his supporters a concrete effort 
to improve two of Port-au-Prince's most pressing concerns. 
Post will continue to pressure Preval against joining 
PetroCaribe.  Ambassador will see Preval's senior advisor Bob 
Manuel today.  In previous meetings, he has acknowledged our 
concerns and is aware that a deal with Chavez would cause 
problems with us.  End comment.
