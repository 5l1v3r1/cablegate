SUBJECT: ONE STEP BACK FOR GLOBAL POLIO ERADICATION: FOUR 
CASES IN YEMEN 
 
¶1. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified four 
cases of polio in Yemen since early February.  According to 
Deputy Minister of Health Dr. Abdulmagid Al-Kulaidi, the 
genetic profile of the polio virus indicates that these cases 
may be related to the ongoing outbreak in Sudan, which in 
turn are related to an outbreak in Nigeria.  WHO 
Representative Dr. Hisham al-Zein hypothesized that the 
transfer point could be Mecca, Saudi Arabia, annual 
destination for millions of Hajj pilgrams. 
 
¶2. Whatever the origins of the virus, the four cases indicate 
current or ongoing tranmission in Yemen.  With results of 
laboratory tests of the four Accute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) 
polio cases still pending, the Yemen Ministry of Health 
swiftly engaged the WHO to conduct a national vaccination 
campaign.  The WHO plans to complete the first innoculation 
campaign in May and June.
