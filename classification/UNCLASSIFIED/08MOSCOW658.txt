¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 
Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) Space Research 
Institute, Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on 
BIS license application D389605 as the ultimate 
consignee of eight AD7821 high speed, up-compatible, 
cmos, 8-bit sampling adc. These items are controlled 
for national security and nuclear proliferation 
reasons under ECCN 3A001. The licensee is Analog 
Devices, Inc., 3 Technology way, Norwood, MA 02062. 
 
¶3. On February 28, 2008, Export Control Attache Peter 
Liston and LES Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of (RAS) 
Space Research Institute, 84/32 Profsoyuznaya st., 
Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with Igor 
Mitrofanov, Doctor of Sciences, Ph.D, , Head of 
Laboratory of space gamma-ray spectroscopy. 
 
¶4. The Russian Academy of Science (RAS), Space 
Research Institute is one of the leading organizations 
in the field of investigations of Outer Space, Solar 
System planets and other objects of the Universe.  The 
Space Research Institute (IKI) is primarily in charge 
of long-range planning and elaboration of space 
research programs, of which a considerable part is 
performed within the framework of international space 
research cooperation.  The Space Research Institute 
takes part in the Federal Space Program that is being 
formed by the RAS Space Council and by the appropriate 
sections of this Council together with the Federal 
Space Agency (Roscosmos). The Space Research Institute 
of the Russian Academy of Science has cooperated in 
projects with Russia's Federal Space Agency (FSA), 
NASA and European Space Agency (ESA). 
 
¶5.  Igor Mitrofanov, Doctor of Sciences, Ph.D, , Head 
of Laboratory of space gamma-ray spectroscopy, is the 
research specialist in charge of the Dynamic Albedo of 
Neutrons (DAN) project.  Igor Mitrofanov when on to 
explain that the DAN project is intended to detect 
subsurface water on Mars.  One way to look for water 
on Mars is to look for neutrons escaping from the 
planet's surface. Cosmic rays from space constantly 
bombard the surface of Mars, knocking neutrons in 
soils and rocks out of their atomic orbits. If liquid 
or frozen water happens to be present, hydrogen atoms 
slow the neutrons down. In this way, some of the 
neutrons escaping into space have less energy and move 
more slowly. These slower particles can be measured 
with a neutron detector. 
 
¶6.  Igor Mitrofanov, Doctor of Sciences, Ph.D, , Head 
of Laboratory of space gamma-ray spectroscopy 
described the intended use of the (8) AD7821 high 
speed, up compatible, CMOS, 8-bit as a means to 
convert analog readings to digital during the DAN 
project.  Igor Mitrofanov was familiar with the 
products performance and characteristics, and stated 
that in his lab, he makes every attempt to obtain the 
highest quality products available in the open market. 
 
¶7.  The Export Control Team Moscow did not ditect any 
possible connect with State sponsored terrorism, and 
the lab is not involved in any chemical, biological, 
nuclear or missile programs. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends Russian Academy of 
Sciences (RAS) Space Research Institute, Moscow, 
Russia, as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. 
origin commodities. It is requested that post be 
notified of final disposition of the application, and 
of any shipments for this organization in order to 
conduct appropriate FCS follow-up and statistical 
reporting.
