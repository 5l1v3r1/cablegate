Gratitude for International Assistance 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the May 20, 2008 regular MFA press briefing, MFA Spokesman Qin 
Gang expressed the "gratitude of the Chinese people and government" 
for the international assistance and condolences following the 
earthquake which struck Sichuan Province May 12.  Qin said that 166 
countries and over 30 international groups have expressed 
"solicitude" over the disaster.  In addition, rescue teams from the 
Republic of Korea, Singapore, Russia and Japan took part in the 
rescue work.  China will also allow medical teams from Germany, 
Italy, Russia and Japan to assist in Sichuan.  Other countries have 
expressed their desire to send teams and the China Red Cross will 
make the decision on what help is needed when.  Qin said requests to 
help would be viewed positively, but transportation and 
communication issues make accepting the teams difficult.  Qin said 
the rescue teams exhibited professionalism and worked in spite of 
dangerous conditions.  China is still asking for tents and 
medications.  China has been greatly moved by the responses of 
foreign governments and civil organizations to its requests for 
help, said Qin. 
 
Six Party Talks Maintain Momentum 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3. In response to a journalisQ question on reported meetings 
between negotiators, Qin said the Six-Party Talks have "maintained 
momentum" and relevant parties had maintained contact.  China hopes 
recent meetings will "produce positive results." 
 
Taiwan Ineligible for WHA 
------------------------- 
 
¶4. Regarding granting observer status for Taiwan at the World Health 
Assembly (WHA), Qin said Taiwan is ineligible under the WHA's own 
rules.  China attaches great importance to the health of its "Taiwan 
compatriots."  Under a "technical exchange" Memorandum of 
Understanding, 15 Taiwan groups have already participated in 27 WHO 
"technical activities."  Qin emphasized that "there is only one 
China in the world and both the Mainland and Taiwan belong to the 
same China."  Qin referred questions about Ma Ying-jeou's inaugural 
speech to the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office. 
 
No Wrong Signals to Dalai Lama 
------------------------------ 
 
¶5. Asked about the Dalai Lama's activities in Germany, Qin 
reiterated China's "persistent and clear" opposition to any country, 
groups or individuals using the Dalai Lama to interfere in China's 
internal affairs.  Qin noted that "with joint efforts" the 
Germany-China relationship is "gradually" getting back on track. 
Germany has made commitments to the one China policy and China hopes 
that Germany will honor these commitments and not send any wrong 
signals to the Dalai Lama in order to "ensure the sound development 
of China-Germany relations." 
 
No Information on Iran Nuclear Proposal 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Qin said he was not authorized to release any information on the 
Iranian nuclear proposals, but that information would probably be 
released soon.  China wants a peaceful solution to the issue, said 
Qin.

¶7. Qin gave details of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's schedule 
while in China.  Medvedev will meet with President Hu Jintao on the 
afternoon of May 23 after which there will be a press conference.
