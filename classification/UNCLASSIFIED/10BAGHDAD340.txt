¶3.  On December 15, 2009, the PRT co-sponsored a forensics 
workshop with 3/3 Brigade's Criminal Task Force (CTF).  That 
team includes a former FBI agent who has investigated high 
profile crimes.  The PRT sought and obtained local judicial 
buy-in before planning the workshop.  More than 30 judges and 
police investigators attended.  A local reporter attended in 
an &on background8 basis.  The workshop began with a 
briefing from the Army Crime Lab about the training they 
provided to their Iraqi counterparts and included a tour of 
the facility.  The training helped local fingerprint 
examiners meet internationally accepted standards of 
competence. 
 
¶4.  The former FBI agent also gave a two-hour presentation of 
the investigation of the Polly Klaas case.  He discussed how 
the case was investigated and the key role that forensic 
evidence played in determining the criminal,s identity and 
proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.   The workshop 
concluded with a presentation from the Director of the Al 
Hillah Crime Lab.  He discussed the lab,s capabilities and 
answered questions from the judges about the lab,s 
operation.  He concluded with a request from the judges to 
increase their utilization of lab services.

¶5.  Immediately after the workshop, PRT Rule of Law Advisor 
and Prosecuting Judge (PJ) Mohaned Al Dulami discussed the 
possibility of additional training sessions.  Al Dulami asked 
that an additional session be scheduled in the spring. 
Provincial Chief Judge Diya,a Omran also requested another 
workshop.  He said the workshop was so successful in opening 
eyes to the effectiveness and utility of forensic evidence 
that an earlier session was needed to capitalize on the 
intellectual momentum of the first workshop.  The Brigade and 
PRT scheduled and conducted a second session on January 5, 
¶2010.  Brigade CTF told the ROLA that after the workshops he 
received requests that he repeat his presentation to judges 
and investigators in Najaf and Wasit. 
 
COMMENT

¶6.  Comment:  These workshops were a start to a necessary 
educational effort for police, investigators and all types of 
judges in Babil province.  Practical exercises like this 
allow trainees to gain first-hand experience utilizing their 
classroom skills in a controlled environment. Additionally, 
journalists are a powerful force in creating an environment 
of change in the system.  They have the unique ability to 
publicize the efficiency of these tools in proving guilt, and 
the lack of utilization of the tools in actual cases where 
the capability for their use exists.  This can create a 
demand from average citizens for a more open and effective 
Qdemand from average citizens for a more open and effective 
justice system.  End comment.
