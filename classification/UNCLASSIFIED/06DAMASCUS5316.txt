¶1.  Summary: Syrian papers featured a statement by Dr. Sami Khiyami, 
Syrian Ambassador to the UK, in an interview broadcast on Wednesday 
(Nov. 15) by the Syrian Satellite TV channel, saying that Syria has 
 
repeatedly declared that it will be the prime beneficiary from 
revelation of the truth about the al-Hariri assassination.  However, 
if the International Tribunal is formed without solid evidence, it 
will only "make the tribunal a tool for political pressure on 
Lebanon, the national (Islamic) resistance and Syria."  Khiyami 
stressed that Syria will remain the safeguard of security and 
stability in the region and will continue helping Lebanon to 
maintain its stability and to reach real sovereignty and 
independence.  Dr. Khiyami, who also gave a lecture in Damascus on 
Tuesday, said that "some wise US politicians have started to change 
their tone and (are exerting) pressure in order to start a dialogue 
with Syria."  "Everybody in the West is aware of the geopolitical 
importance of Syria, which makes her a basic player in any 
reconciliation in the region," Dr. Khiyami said.  He added that 
Syria will continue its "constructive cooperation with the European 
countries that have political credibility and it wishes to reach out 
for a settlement in the region." 
Papers also reported a statement by US Secretary of State Condaleeza 
Rice at Ramstein Air Base in Germany as she flew to Hanoi for the 
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation regional summit, on Tuesday (Nov. 
14) in which Rice was skeptical about British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair's plea for US talks with Iran and Syria, saying that neither 
appeared interested in helping stabilize Iraq or the Middle East. 
"There is no lack of opportunity to talk to the Iranians.  I think 
the question is: is there anything about Iranian behavior that 
suggests that they are prepared to contribute to stability in Iraq, 
and I have to say that at this point, I don't see it," Rice said. 
Rice did not rule out talks with Iran about Iraq, noting there is a 
channel between the US and Iranian ambassadors to Iraq "that, at 
some point, it could make sense to activate."  But she made clear 
that she saw little profit in such discussions. "I will talk to 
anybody, anywhere, anytime, under the right circumstances, if I 
think we can make progress," she said.  "But we have had, over the 
course of this administration, discussions with the Syrians, talks 
with the Syrians, envoys to the Syrians, and nothing has ever 
changed in their behavior." 
 
End of summary.

"They Are Not for Peace"

Isam Dari, an editorialist in government-owned Tishreen, commented 
(11/16):  "Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's visit to the United 
States was not a departure from the norm except, perhaps, for a 
sentence that can be construed as both a reprimand and an 
encouragement.

"The sentence was uttered by US President George Bush: Israel should 
train its forces in light of the results of the war on Lebanon, and 
the United States will provide it with weapons and technology. 
 
"Can this statement by the world's strongest and only superpower be 
interpreted as anything other than incitement for war and 
aggression? 
 
"It was obvious that Olmert immediately took the opportunity offered 
by this incitement to declare openly:  The resumption of 
negotiations with Syria is impossible under the current 
circumstances. 
 
"Thus, and in such a simple way, the Bush administration and the 
Olmert government demolish all bridges and roads that might lead to 
peace.  Indeed, Bush backtracked on statements by White House 
officials on the need to open dialogue with Damascus.  This proves 
that this administration opposes peace more than Israel does, and 
that it has not yet learned the lesson of the recent election, which 
showed, for the first time, that the American public is dissatisfied 
with US foreign policy.  In all previous elections, domestic issues 
were the main player. 
 
"The problem here lies not in rejecting dialogue with Syria and 
resuming peace negotiations, but in rejecting the very idea of a 
peace conference and in heightening tension in the region and 
beating the drums of war.  Does this help bring about the security 
and calm in which the Bush administration trades, and which it 
falsely claims it wants to prevail in a region that has been 
suffering from the scourge of wars, disasters, destruction, and 
terrorism -- the terrorism that found a strong international sponsor 
to defend, support, and encourage? 
 
"In brief:  Washington and Tel Aviv are jointly saying:  No to 
peace.  This is very natural. For the warmongers and the merchants 
of blood and destruction cannot make peace.

"In his new visit to Washington, Olmert succeeded, as his 
predecessors did.  The American weapon and technology stores 
remained open for Israel to scoop as much as it wants to fuel wars 
and terror.  This has always been the purpose of the American and 
Israeli weapons, and...goodbye peace."

"A Punched Ball and Small Players" 
---------------------------------- 
Khalid al-Ashhab, a commentator in government-owned Al-Thawra, wrote 
(11/16):  "Washington's small agents in Lebanon went bankrupt after 
the series of losses and successive defeats that the US 
Administration and its plan in the region suffered.... 
"When a big merchant goes bankrupt, small agents and dealers are 
lost....  Their projects are destroyed and their ambitions 
frustrated....  They start searching for a lifeline by all means and 
at any price...."
