The Department has reviewed its files and finds that it 
possesses no credible information of gross violations of 
human rights at this time by the Lebanese candidates and 
units listed in reftel for proposed participation in DS/ATA's 
Senior Crisis Management course (ATA 7125).  If at any time 
the Embassy becomes aware of any information regarding 
incidents which could be deemed to be credible information of 
a gross violation of human rights by these individuals or 
units, the Embassy should so inform the Department.
