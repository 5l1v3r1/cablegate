¶1. (U) According to a page 4 story in the May 25 issue of the 
daily Sme, the deployment of Slovak soldiers in Iraq is not 
an issue in the campaign leading up to June 17 elections. The 
daily predicts that this situation will not change after the 
formation of a new government since most parties are opposed 
to withdrawing Slovak forces from Iraq absent close 
coordination with allies. 
 
¶2. (U) According to Sme, all the major parties are hoping to 
withdraw forces "sooner or later," but only the Communist 
Party of Slovakia (KSS) advocates an immediate withdrawal. 
The PM,s Party of the Democratic and Christian Union (SDKU) 
is the most favorably disposed towards remaining in Iraq, 
followed by the second party in the current governing 
coalition, the Party of the Hungarian Coalition (SMK). 
 
¶3. (U) The most popular party, Smer, resisted Slovak 
participation in the invasion of Iraq in 2003, but now says 
that any withdrawal must be done in coordination with 
coalition countries. The Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), 
which was a member of the governing coalition when the 
decision to invade was made, similarly emphasizes it was a 
mistake to participate in the invasion, but accepts that 
Slovak forces may only be withdrawn in coordination with 
allies. 
 
¶4. (U) Comment. This report is consistent with what post has 
heard from other sources. Foreign policy in general, 
including the deployment to Iraq, has not been an issue in 
the campaign up to now and post expects that, barring 
casualties among the Slovak contingent, it will not become an 
issue during the remaining three weeks of the campaign. That 
said, a different government could still reconsider 
Slovakia's military presence in Iraq and some parties have 
stated a preference to undertake such a reconsideration if 
elected. End comment.
