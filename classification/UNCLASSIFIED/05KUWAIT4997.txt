SUBJECT: Iraq-Kuwait Soccer Face Off -- 15 Years Later 
 
¶1. Kuwait and Iraq faced off on the soccer field for the 
first time since before the first Gulf War.  The match held 
on November 26, 2005 between the Iraqi and Kuwaiti national 
teams was part of the elimination round for the Asia Cup 
finals.  The result of the game, played in Kuwait, was a 
huge disappointment to Kuwaiti fans and commentators. All 
five major Kuwaiti Arabic language newspapers lamented the 
poor performances of both teams which ultimately resulted in 
the 0-0 draw. Headlines read: "The game was not up to the 
hoped or expected levels; 0-0 draw for blue ("blue" refers 
to the Kuwaiti team's blue uniforms) with Iraq on playing 
and scoring"; "The elders tie and the hope is in the youth"; 
"Blue vs. Iraq. two zeros"; "A faded Iraqi experience for 
the blue." 
 
¶2. While this match was dubbed historic as the first game 
between the Gulf neighbors in 15 years, the last time the 
teams met on February 28, 1990, that game also ended in a 
tie.  The score was 1-1, as part of the tenth Gulf Cup.  The 
two teams have not competed since the invasion of Kuwait by 
Iraq in 1991.  Sports commentators said that despite 
Kuwait's possession of the ball for most of the game, they 
presented no real danger to the goal of their Iraqi 
counterparts.  Kuwaiti sports reporters complained that 
contestants did not take the game seriously, nor did they 
exert their best efforts.  Adding insult to injury, the 
Kuwaiti junior team was beaten by the Iraqi junior team 1-0 
on November 28, 2005. 
 
¶3. One editorial cartoon lampooned the loss for the juniors, 
showing a father with a newborn son dismissing modern "weak" 
names such as Hani in favor of old-fashioned "strong" names 
such as Jabar (mighty), Raad (thunder), or Barq (lighting) 
with the implied hope that such names will ensure future 
Kuwaiti victories on the soccer field.
