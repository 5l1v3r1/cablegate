will complete the training of the prison guard detachment for the

order to comply with Leahy vetting requirements, this cable forwards

(Note: Ref c and d requested vetting of the officer and the enlisted 
guard force. This cable supersedes those requests. End Note)

this circumstance post is submitting only the name of the unit
