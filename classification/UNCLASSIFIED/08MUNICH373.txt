REF: STATE 118192 
 
¶1.  Consulate Munich received a congratulatory message to 
President-Elect Barack Obama dated November 5 from Horst Seehofer, 
Minister President of Bavaria.  The letter includes an invitation to 
the annual Munich Conference on Security Policy (MSC), February 6-8, 
¶2009.  The conference regularly attracts high-level politicians, 
ministers, and scholars for open discussion on global security 
issues.  The U.S. Delegation has in the past been headed by the 
Secretary of Defense and has included a Congressional Delegation led 
by Senators Lieberman and McCain.  A hard copy of the letter and 
invitation was sent to S/ES-CR on November 18.  Below is the 
informal translation of the letter's text. 
 
¶2.  Begin Text: 
 
Dear Senator Obama, 
 
I am sending you my heartfelt congratulations from Bavaria on the 
occasion of your recent success in the Presidential elections. 
 
I wish you luck in your endeavors, God's blessing and much success 
in organizing the future of your country and in taking on the 
leading role of the United States in World politics. 
 
Your overwhelming election victory will start a new era of 
transatlantic cooperation.  The American voters have set a clear 
signal for political change.  Europe needs the U.S. as a strong 
partner in the World, and the U.S. needs Europe. 
 
The World's leading security conference will take place in the 
Bavarian capital of Munich beginning of February 2009.  It offers 
the American President an excellent opportunity to introduce his 
foreign and security policy initiatives to a high-ranking and 
professional audience on European grounds.  I would be pleased, if 
we could welcome you on this occasion here in Bavaria. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
(signed) Horst Seehofer 
 
The Honorable 
Barack Obama 
The President Elect 
Washington
