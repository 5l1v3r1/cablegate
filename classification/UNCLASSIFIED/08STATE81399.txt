¶3.  Begin text of letter: 
 
Dear Ms. Forsyth: 
 
On behalf of the U.S. Government, I want to thank you for 
your presentation on improving international cooperation for 
more rapid interdiction action, in the panel on ways to 
continue strengthening the Proliferation Security Initiative 
(PSI) at the May 28, 2008 Senior-Level Meeting for PSI 
participants in Washington DC.  Your presentation made an 
important contribution to the panel and the meeting overall. 
We especially appreciate New Zealand's initiative to develop 
the PSI Model National Response Plan and distribute it to 
participating countries during the PSI 5th Anniversary. 
 
I believe the PSI Fifth Anniversary Senior-Level Meeting was 
very successful in reaffirming the strong commitment of the 
PSI partner states to respond to the WMD proliferation 
challenge.  It also provided the participants from 85 
countries an opportunity to strengthen communication with one 
another.  We hope this event will result in expanded 
participation in PSI activities, particularly on a regional 
basis.  The United States recognizes that New Zealand plays a 
significant role in the PSI, and we greatly appreciate your 
Government's continued efforts and contributions to advancing 
the PSI goals. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
John C. Rood 
Acting Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and 
International Security
