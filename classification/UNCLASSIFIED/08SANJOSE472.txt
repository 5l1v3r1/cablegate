SUBJECT: COSTA RICA URGES SUPPORT OF UNSC PRESIDENTIAL 
STATEMENT ON ICC PROSECUTOR'S REPORT 
 
 
¶1. Post received a diplomatic note, transmitted from the MFA 
on June 2, urging the U.S. to support a UNSC presidential 
statement on the International Criminal Court Prosecutor's 
Seventh Report to be issued on June 5. The note asked that 
the Embassy be the official conduit of the request to the 
Department. The note did not include the declaration text. An 
unofficial translation of relevant portions follows. 
 
¶2. Begin text of diplomatic note. 
 
The Office of Foreign Policy of the Ministry of Foreign 
 
Relations gives its compliments to the Embassy and refers to 
the presidential declaration that UNSC members are 
negotiating in relation to the Seventh Report to be presented 
by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on June 
¶5. 
 
The Office of Foreign Policy of the Ministry of Foreign 
Relations considers it very important that the UNSC approve a 
presidential declaration which indicates principles shared by 
our two countries, such as the end of impunity and the 
obligation that all States have to obey resolutions that the 
UNSC approves via Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. Costa Rica 
requests that the U.S. support the declaration. 
 
End text. 
 
¶3. A follow-up phone call on June 4 to Deyanira Ramirez, MFA 
UN Desk Officer, clarified that the declaration is related to 
Article 39 of Chapter 7 of the Charter. Ramirez added that 
there was a vote on a similar resolution 1593 in 2005 
regarding Sudan, and the U.S. abstained. The GOCR is 
requesting that the U.S. join in on consensus approval.
