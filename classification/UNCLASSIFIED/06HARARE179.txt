¶1. (SBU) This is an action request; please see para 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy has received numerous inquiries from 
American companies about the USG's targeted sanctions policy 
in Zimbabwe and its implication for their operations here. 
To be responsive to our business community, pre-empt 
additional inquiries, forestall potential misunderstandings, 
and assist U.S. companies in their efforts to avoid 
inadvertently violating sanctions, we propose to send letters 
under the Ambassador's signature advising American companies 
here of our sanctions policy. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Embassy seeks Department clearance 
for the following text in communicating with American 
companies in Zimbabwe.

Mr./Ms. Very I. Person 
Managing Director 
Large American Company 
1234 Samora Machel 
Harare 
 
Dear Mr./Ms. Person: 
 
We have received inquiries from several American firms about 
the implications of U.S. sanctions policies on their 
operations in Zimbabwe.  This letter is intended to convey to 
you general information about our sanctions policies and to 
identify resources with additional information that you can 
access if you so require. 
 
Revised Executive Order 13288 (enclosed), signed by President 
Bush on November 22, 2005, bars U.S. citizens, permanent 
residents, and U.S.-based corporations from conducting 
transactions with those who formulate, implement, or benefit 
from policies that undermine Zimbabwe's democratic 
institutions.  A list of these individuals and their known 
instrumentalities is enclosed for your information in order 
to facilitate your ability to conduct business in Zimbabwe 
without unwittingly violating U.S. law. 
 
As you know, this policy is not a generalized economic 
sanction against the country or the people of Zimbabwe.  This 
policy is specifically targeted against a limited group of 
individuals who have been and are responsible for undermining 
Zimbabwe,s democratic institutions.  Americans are free to 
conduct business with Zimbabweans who are not on the 
sanctions list. 
 
If you would like more detailed information, please contact 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) within the U.S. 
Department of Treasury.  You can visit the OFAC website at 
www.treas.gov/ofac and/or call the OFAC compliance hotline at 
202-622-2430.  The enclosed OFAC fact sheet also has more 
specific information regarding penalties and procedures. 
 
I urge your firm to take this opportunity to review your 
business dealings in Zimbabwe to ensure compliance with the 
enclosed Executive Order and annex. 
 
Should you have specific questions on the applicability of 
sanctions to your company's operations, we would be happy to 
work further with you.  You may wish to contact Frances 
Chisholm in the Embassy's Political/Economic Section if you 
require additional information.  She can be reached directly 
 
HARARE 00000179  002 OF 002 
 
 
at 250-593 Ext. 206 or ChisholmFM@state.gov.
