¶1.  MFA provided to us March 11 a list of 31 police trainers 
that the GOT is preparing to send to the Iraqi police 
training facility outside Amman.  MFA Deputy Iraq Coordinator 
Ethem Tokdemir told us that they could be ready to travel as 
early as March 31.  While most are general police trainers, 
among the group are specialists in VIP protection, ethics, 
traffic, crime scene investigation, marksmanship, management, 
and social/gender sensitivity.  All but two are said to have 
English language capabilities; five speak Arabic (the two 
non-English-speakers are among these).  We have faxed the 
list to EUR/SE. 
 
 
¶2.  In presenting the list, Tokdemir noted that the Turkish 
National Police needed copies of the curriculum of the 
courses at the center.  We suggested that the Turkish Embassy 
in Amman approach the training center for this material.  He 
agreed.
