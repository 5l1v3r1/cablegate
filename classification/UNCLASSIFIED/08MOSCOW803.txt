We delivered reftel demarche on March 24, to MFA ASEAN 
Division Counselor Dimity Lukiyantsev.  Lukiyantsev said that 
the GOR was pleased to learn that the U.S. was considering 
resuming consultations with ASEAN regarding P-5 adherence to 
the SEANWFZ protocol.  He explained that the GOR was also 
waiting for ASEAN to respond to the joint paper delivered to 
ASEAN by France on behalf of the P-4 in 2002, a point that 
was stressed during the annual Russia-ASEAN meeting held in 
Moscow in February.  The ASEAN delegation told the GOR that 
ASEAN could provide a response as early as March or April.
