START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
David Neufeld is manager for the Water Planning Policy 
Branch, at the Ontario Ministry of the Environment.  Water 
management is an important topic in the Canada-U.S. dialogue 
that is only going to be increasing in importance.  In a 
November 2004 report, Adele Hurley, Munk Centre, University 
of Toronto, ("Rising Tensions: Canada/U.S. Cross Border 
Water Issues in the 21st Century") suggests the two 
countries have enjoyed much cooperation on environmental 
management, however, with the U.S. planning to proceed with 
the Devils Lake diversion as well as the ongoing border 
closure to Canadian animals, conflicts over water will 
likely increase in the years ahead. 
Mr. Neufeld's IVLP would give him first-hand insights into 
U.S. points of view, research and the policymaking process 
related to water management, as well as more accurate 
perspectives on the  thinking behind the complex agreements 
that exist for sharing water resources between our 
countries.   This project would support the Mission's goal 
of building cooperation on environmental protection.
