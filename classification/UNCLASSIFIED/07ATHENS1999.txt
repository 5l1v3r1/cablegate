SUBJECT: GRREK PARTICIPATION IN G8-BMENA FORUM FOR THE 
FUTURE SUBMINISTERIAL, BERLIN, OCTOBER 22-23 
 
REF: STATE 136556 
 
Â¶1.  In response to reftel, MFA Deputy Director for Middle 
East issues George Aifantis confirmed on October 5 that 
Greece plans to participate in the upcoming BMENA Forum for 
the Future Subministerial.  FM Bakoyiannis, who is personally 
interested in BMENA, was considering attending herself.  If 
she does not, Greece will likely be represented by Deputy FM 
Valinakis or Deputy FM Doukas (new to his MFA position 
following the September 16 elections).  Aifantis emphasized 
that the GOG wanted to put "steam" behind BMENA's efforts -- 
which was why it planned to paraticipate at a senior level.
