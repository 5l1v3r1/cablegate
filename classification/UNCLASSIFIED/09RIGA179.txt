SUBJECT: Latvia welcomes results of Afghanistan - Pakistan strategic 
review 
 
Ref: State 29482 
 
Â¶1. We delivered the reftel white paper to the Latvian government on 
March 27.  On March 30, the MFA provided the following reaction to 
our strategic review: 
 
-- We welcome the new US Policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan, 
highlighting the main goals and challenges shared by international 
community. 
 
-- Afghanistan needs one strategy for the whole country; therefore 
coordinated policy of all the international actors, such as the EU, 
NATO and the UN, is of utmost importance. We fully support the need 
for integrated civilian- military approach in coordinating, planning 
and delivering the assistance. 
 
-- Successful development of Afghanistan depends on Afghan people's 
confidence in their government. It is important to ensure that the 
elections are credible and that the new Afghan government is in 
control of political processes and has the support of the Afghan 
population in the whole country. 
 
-- We share the idea that focusing civilian assistance and capacity 
building on strengthening provincial and local governments would be 
of help in serving the people and connecting them to their 
government. 
 
-- We fully share the idea and necessity of building up the Afghan 
Security Forces (ANA and ANP). We welcome the US decision on sending 
more troops to Afghanistan as it might help to reduce the number of 
casualties.  In the provinces where security permits we see a 
possibility to put more focus on training in the years to come. 
 
-- Situation in Afghanistan should be viewed in a broader regional 
context. We fully endorse initiatives aimed at strengthening the 
regional cooperation and continuation of the trilateral 
US-Pakistan-Afghanistan commitment. 
 
-- Latvia remains committed to contribute its share to the joint 
efforts of international community concentrating on the security, 
stability and development of Afghanistan.
