AS GOCI ANNOUNCES FORUM TO ADDRESS PUBLIC SECTOR LABOR 
GRIEVANCES 
 
 ¶1.  (U) Cote d'Ivoire's "paramedics" (public health workers 
excluding doctors, who have pursued their own pay grievances 
independently) ended a 3-week old strike on January 29, 
following government commitments to give them two thirds of 
the pay increase they were demanding.  This agreement, 
increasing the so-called paramedical allowance from CFA 
20,000 to CFA 40,000 (about USD 40 to USD 80) per month has 
brought back to work 6,000 nurses, 2,500 midwives and 2,500 
health technicians who had refused to work in public 
hospitals and clinics during the strike's duration. 
 
¶2.  (U) According to unconfirmed press accounts, up to sixty 
people died as a result of being denied treatment at 
government facilities, particularly university teaching 
hospitals in populous sections of Greater Abidjan.  Public 
attention to the strike was high, and even family members of 
domestic staff of Embassy employees reported being affected 
(the death of one such family member has been attributed to 
denial of care).  Negotiations involved the Ministers of 
Health, Labor and Finance, but finally required the personal 
intervention of Prime Minister Banny, who brokered the 
eventual compromise. 
 
¶3.  (U) Several outstanding demands remain (new allowances 
for risk and housing, review of current pay scales) and the 
implementation of the agreement hinges on payment of the 
increased allowances in July, retroactively back to January. 
The outstanding concerns of the paramedics are to be 
addressed at an upcoming February 15 "Social Forum" which was 
announced after the January 17 Cabinet meeting (presided over 
by President Gbagbo and attended by Prime Minister Banny). 
The Forum is intended to cover labor grievances throughout 
the public sector, such as dangerous work conditions, 
training, pay scales and job classification.
