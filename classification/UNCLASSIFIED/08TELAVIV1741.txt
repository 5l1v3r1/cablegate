SUBJECT: GOI: NEW DESIGNATIONS LAW SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE 
CABINET IN LATE OCTOBER 
 
REF: A. STATE 80168 
     ¶B. TEL AVIV 1411 
 
¶1. Per reftel "A", econoff transmitted the new list of UN 
1267 designations to Roy Keidar, Legal Advisor to the Israeli 
National Security Council (NSC). On August 7, Keidar 
responded to econoff to inform him that the GOI still did not 
have the capacity to designate the new UN 1267 entities 
within its current legal framework (see reftel "B"). 
 
¶2. Keidar updated econoff on the status of Israel's pending 
initiative to adopt a procedure that would allow it to come 
into compliance with UN 1267. Keidar told econoff that the 
NSC intends to bring the new framework it has developed 
before the cabinet at the end of October. He added, however, 
that "as always in Israel," final approval would be subject 
to political considerations. NOTE: The NSC intends to adopt 
retroactively all US domestic designations and those of the 
UN 1267 committee as soon as the Cabinet approves of the new 
procedure. END NOTE.
