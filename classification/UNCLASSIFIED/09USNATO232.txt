¶1. (U) SUMMARY: In a June 3 meeting with the North Atlantic 
Council (NAC), representatives from the four Istanbul 
Cooperation Initiative (ICI) countries pledged to work both 
in and out of the ICI structure with NATO on issues of common 
concern, such as piracy.  The Kuwaiti Ambassador argued that 
before NATO can improve its image in the Gulf region, it must 
first work to improve its image at home in Allied countries. 
Secretary General (SYG) Jaap de Hoop Scheffer announced that 
the North Atlantic Council would travel to the UAE in the 
fall of 2009.  The Secretary General joined Allies in 
encouraging the ICI countries to actively engage NATO through 
the various ICI mechanisms.   END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Slowly deepening relations with NATO 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) At a June 3 meeting of the North Atlantic Council with 
the four members of NATO's Istanbul Cooperation Initiative 
partnership (Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE), the 
Kuwaiti Ambassador stated that counter-piracy operations 
ALLIED PROTECTOR (NATO) and ATALANTA (EU) had energized even 
the non-European countries (including ICI observers Saudi 
Arabia and Oman) to become involved in negotiations, because 
-- in her words -- global problems require global solutions. 
She briefed with pride that a status of forces agreement with 
Kuwait had been finalized, and a transit agreement with NATO 
will hopefully be finalized soon.  She thanked Germany and 
France for providing her Embassy with briefs on the outcomes 
of the Strasbourg/Kehl Summit.  Although she welcomed 
consultations between NATO and Saudi Arabia designed to bring 
that country into the ICI as a partner, she admitted that 
Saudi Arabia and Oman will take their cooperation with NATO 
at their own pace and will join the ICI "in due time."  The 
Kuwaiti Ambassador clarified that just because those 
countries were only observers to the ICI, they were not being 
left out of the pertinent conversations.  She noted that both 
Saudi Arabia and Oman had sent representatives to a visit of 
the NATO Permanent Representatives (PermReps) to Bahrain in 
¶2008.  The Kuwaiti Ambassador stated that whether in or 
outside of the ICI structure, "willy-nilly, we will 
cooperate" with NATO.

Kuwait: NATO, take a look in the mirror 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) In response to a call from Allies for the ICI 
countries to assist NATO in improving its image in the Gulf 
region, the Kuwaiti Ambassador bluntly responded that before 
the NAC tasks ICI countries to assist in this effort, Allies 
need to take a strong look at the Alliance's image in their 
own countries.  She argued that NATO looks weak not only in 
the Middle East, but in the Euro-Atlantic area.  She stated 
that education is a two-way street, adding that while ICI 
countries are willing to assist NATO in improving its image, 
NATO needs to do more work at home in this regard.  The 
Kuwaiti Ambassador made a point of stressing the symbolic 
difference in seating the ICI representatives at a table 
alongside the SYG, instead of facing the Council in a more 
adversarial arrangement, as had been done during the first 
meeting in this format in November 2008. 
 
¶4. (U) Norway and Italy were quick to respond that NATO's 
image differs from country to country, but NATO enjoys a 
bedrock of support from Allied populations.  Italy encouraged 
ideas generated by the ICI countries, noting that they should 
not wait for Allies to "come up with all of the ideas."  The 
SYG, who also enlisted the assistance of ICI countries in 
helping improve NATO's image in the Gulf, admitted that NATO 
should be more proactive in explaining the organization.

¶5. (U) The Secretary General announced an upcoming public 
diplomacy trip by PermReps to the UAE in the fall of 2009. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Active ICI Engagement Encouraged 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) The Secretary General encouraged the ICI countries to 
donate to the Afghan National Army Trust Fund.  Preparing to 
launch a new Strategic Concept, he invited the ICI 
representatives to attend a seminar in July designed to 
examine NATO's perception in the outside world.  Meanwhile, 
Allies called for the ICI countries to develop Individual 
Cooperation Programs with NATO.

Comment

¶7. (U) NATO Allies, usually quick to tell the ICI partners 
that their nations are not doing enough to promote the 
positive image of NATO in the Gulf, were taken aback by the 
Kuwaiti Ambassador's comments and the blunt manner in which 
they were given.  However, this exchange illustrates the 
gradual maturing of the ICI partnership.  With the visit of 
PermReps to the UAE later this year, Allies have another 
opportunity to learn first-hand about their ICI partners.
