REF: TOKYO 03263 
 
1) SUMMARY: On July 17, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) 
announced additional problems that occurred at the 
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Niigata Prefecture 
due to the powerful earthquake that hit the prefecture on 
July 16. However, Japanese government sources indicated to 
ESTOFF that these problems pose no increased threat to the 
environment or human safety based on their current 
understanding of the situation. END SUMMARY. 
 
2) Most notably, TEPCO reported an increased amount of 
radioactive substances emitted  into the atmosphere.  TEPCO 
issued a corrected statement on July 18 in which it admitted 
it miscalculated the amount of radiation leakage. Originally 
it reported 60,000Bq of radiation had been released, however, 
after recalculation, TEPCO determined the estimated amount to 
be 90,000Bq of radioactivity material. 
 
3) At the No.7 reactor that automatically stopped operations 
due to the quake, radioactive iodine, cobalt, and chromium 
were detected in a filter of the main ventilation system when 
it was removed in a weekly routine exchange and then 
measured. The total detected amount of radioactivity is 
estimated to be 3X10 8Bq. However, radiation dose from this 
radioactivity is estimated to be approximately 1.1X10 -7mSv, 
which is quite less than legal safety standards (1mSv/year). 
Therefore, there is no impact on the surrounding environment, 
according to Japanese official reports. In the Radioactive 
Solid Waste Storage House No. 2, approximately 100 drums 
toppled and lids of several drums were open. TEPCO said that 
after inspecting the floor, 0.5 vectors of radiation per 
square meter were released.  The contamination is still under 
investigation, however, according to Post's contact in the 
Japan Nuclear Energy Safety Organization, the drums contained 
low-level nuclear waste and pose no imminent threat to the 
environment.
