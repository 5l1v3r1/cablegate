¶1. (U) SUMMARY. Wasit province was allocated eight seats in the 
December 15, 2005 elections to the Council of 
Representatives(CoR). The United Iraqi Alliance (ballot number 
555) received seven of the eight seats. Biographical information 
follows for six of the seven UIA/555 members in the CoR. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------------- 
MOHAMMED IZELDINE MUTTAR AL-KHATEEB 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Male, 34.  Al-Khateeb currently serves as Deputy 
Governor of Wasit, though he has indicated he will resign the 
post after he takes his position in the CoR. Born in 1972 in 
Al-Kut, he earned a degree in accounting from Al-Musensiriyah 
University in Baghdad in 1996. Thereafter, he was employed as an 
accountant at a perfume company in Al-Aziziyah, Wasit province. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Al-Khateeb entered politics as candidate on the "Wasit 
Gathering of Elites" slate (affiliated with the Supreme Council 
of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq and Badr Organization) in the 
January 2005 Provincial Council elections. In April 2005, the 
Provincial Council appointed him Deputy Governor. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Al-Khateeb is related to the SCIRI Transitional 
National Assembly member Habeeb Al-Khateeb. Mohammed Al-Khateeb 
was a surprise choice for the number one slot on the UIA/555 
slate in Wasit, and was selected for the position against the 
wishes of Wasit SCIRI chief Ahmed Al-Hakim. According to 
Al-Khateeb, one reason for his selection was the intervention on 
his behalf by TNA Deputy President Hussein Al-Sharistani. 
Al-Sharistani reportedly shared a prison cell for four years 
with Al-Khateeb's father, who was later executed. Mohammed 
Al-Khateeb is married with three children. Despite his youth, he 
is a widely respected figure in the province, due largely to the 
pious reputation of his father. 
 
---------------------- 
DR. HUSSEIN AMIR RADHI 
---------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Male, 38. Radhi occupied the second position on the 
UIA/555 list and is the leading Sadrist in the Wasit CoR 
delegation. Radhi has no known previous political experience. 
Until 2003, Radhi served as a doctor in the Iraqi Army and 
commanded the Al Karam'mah Military Hospital in Kut. This 
position was generally reserved for upper mid-level Ba'ath Party 
members, though Radhi's own membership in the Ba'ath Party has 
not been confirmed. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Radhi is extremely reluctant to communicate with 
representatives of the USG. Several planned appointments have 
fallen through at the last minute after he was reportedly 
ordered to cancel the meetings at the behest of higher-ranking 
Sadrists in the province. Radhi is married with three children. 
 
-------------------------------- 
MIKBAL KHALEEL GANI ABID AL-HADI 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Female, age unknown. Al-Hadi was listed third on the 
UIA/555 slate and is the only Wasit Badr Organization 
representative to be elected to the CoR. She lived in Iran from 
1980 to 2003 and is married to an Iranian citizen. It is unclear 
whether she is a member of Badr Organization or was merely asked 
by Badr to fill a slot on the ballot reserved for female 
candidates. She appears in public with her face completely 
veiled. 
 
------------------------------------- 
NEM'MAH SALMAN ABBAS KAREEM AL-MAYAHI 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Male, 39. Al-Mayahi is also known as Abu Sadik Al 
Mayahi.  He was listed fourth on the UIA/555 slate and is a 
member of the Dawa (Iraq) party. Al-Mayahi is originally from 
the town of Al-Hay. He has consistently refused to meet with 
representatives of the USG. He is known for his aggressive 
rhetoric against Coalition Forces in Wasit and is openly 
critical of provincial officials who cooperate with Coalition 
Forces and civilian USG personnel. He publicly supported Sadrist 
attacks on CPA offices in Najaf and Al-Kut in 2004.  Al-Mayahi 
is married.

National Assembly in 2005. Al-Hejamy is a practicing physician. 
He holds several degrees in medicine, surgery, immunology and

politics as a local council member in Al-Suwerah, Wasit 
province, and was elected to the Provincial Council in January, 
¶2005. He is married with five children.

Education and Chair of the Arabic Department. Born in 1971, he 
has two degrees from the College of Education at Baghdad 
University and a doctorate from Qadisiyah University.
