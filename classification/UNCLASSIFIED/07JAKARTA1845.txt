democracy and modernity in harmony.  Congressman Moran raised 
the need for accountability for past human rights abuses by 
security forces and Congressman Payne stressed the need for

Israel-Palestinian dispute.  SBY also praised Washington's 
decision to engage with Iran on Iraqi security. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
Yudhoyono vision 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  President Yudhoyono (SBY) described for the Congressmen 
the challenges that Indonesia faces during this period of 
transformation and reform.  He is trying to make Indonesia a 
model for the world, demonstrating that Islam, democracy and 
modernity can live in harmony.  Jakarta remains committed to 
resolving regional issues in Papua, Aceh and Ambon via 
democratic means.  His biggest challenge is how to reduce 
poverty and create jobs.  President SBY praised the U.S. as a 
"critical partner," noting the growing regional influence of 
China and India and thanked the Congressmen for American 
assistance in times of crisis and in normal times. 
 
Congressmen Stress Capacity Building 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. Congressman Payne praised Indonesia's democratic progress 
and pledged that we would remain a close bilateral partner. 
He described briefly the role of the House Democratic Action 
Committee (HDAC) in assisting the parliaments of emerging 
democracies and cited Indonesia's Parliament (DPR) as an 
ideal partner.  Congressman Dreier recommended that 
additional staff and budget for DPR could help inform DPR 
members and improve the level of the debate in the DPR on 
Iran and other issues.   Congressman Moran added that 
increased staffing in the President's office, including via a 
National Security Council, might be helpful.  The President 
noted that "freedom is everywhere" in Indonesia now, but that 
capacity has not been able to keep up.  SBY readily agreed 
that improved DPR training and staffing was necessary. 
 
 
Accountability and Papua 
------------------------ 
 
¶4. Congressman Moran praised President SBY as a reform leader 
and welcomed his commitment to lead Indonesia to a democratic 
and prosperous future.  Acknowledging that democracy cannot 
happen overnight, the Congressman stressed the need for 
Indonesia to hold its security forces accountable for the 
human rights abuses of the past.  SBY assured the Congressman 
that he remained committed to TNI reform as part of his 
overall reform agenda.  In that regard, SBY stressed that 
Indonesia needed to do more to attract foreign direct 
investment.  Congressman Dreier interjected that the WTO and 
conclusion of the Doha Round would help the economies of 
Indonesia and the developing world.   Congressman Payne 
sought and received the President's assurance that he 
remained committed to improving the lives of the people of 
Papua. 
 
Iran and the Middle East 
------------------------ 
 
Congressman Dreier praised Indonesia's vote in favor of UNSCR 
1747 on Iran and requested continued support on subsequent 
resolutions.  The President made no commitment, but described 
the difficult domestic context of the issue.  He recounted 
how he was taking unwarranted criticism in the DPR for 
"caving in to U.S. pressure," over the vote.  This was an 
example of how a better informed and more capable DPR would 
help raise the level of debate in Indonesia on crucial 
international issues.  As the meeting was breaking up, SBY

expressed concern about recent development in Gaza and urged 
Washington to do what we could to cool tensions.  He 
reiterated GOI support for a "two state" solution. 
Congressman Payne welcomed that position and urged Indonesia 
as a moderate Islamic majority democracy to try to use its 
influence with the Palestinians.  Finally, the President 
welcomed recent meetings between U.S. and Iranian officials 
on Iraqi security.
