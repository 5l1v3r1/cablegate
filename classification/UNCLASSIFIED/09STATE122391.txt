SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON THE EXPORT OF U.S. DEFENSE ARTICLES CITING THE CANADIAN 
EXEMPTION 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on a transaction citing the 
Canadian exemption for the export of accelerometers to 
Canada.  Embassy is requested to complete this Blue Lantern 
check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern 
check will affect pending and future licenses involving 
parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Under ITAR 126.5 (Canadian Exemption), 
certain United States Munitions List (USML) items may be 
exported to Canada without a license.  Some items on USML 
Category VII - which includes accelerometers - may be subject 
to Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) restrictions and 
may require a license depending on commodity specification 
and type.  DDTC requests this check based on vague 
description of commodity and end-use in export filing. 
 
¶4. ACTION OTTAWA: Mission Canada is requested to make 
inquiries with appropriate General Dynamics Land System - 
Canada (GDLS) officials to obtain all relevant details 
regarding the export of accelerometers to Canada citing the 
Canadian exemption, including exact commodity description and 
technical parameters for performance and capability, number, 
type, dollar value, and serial number of items.  (See 
paragraph 5 for details of export, including filer 
identification and shipping reference numbers.) 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--What were the exact United States Munitions List (USML) 
articles exported to you on September 11th 2008?  (Automated 
Export System (AES) filing data provides the following 
information, "accelerometer".)  Please provide detail on 
model, type and technical specifications. 
 
--What is the exact end-use for these USML items?  Will GDLS 
be the sole end-user and retain positive control over the 
accelerometers at all times?  Will they be transferred to 
other end-users in Canada or re-exported? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer 
and re-export? 
 
END ACTION.
