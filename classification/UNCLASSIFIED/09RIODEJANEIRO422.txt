Risk of contagion 
 
 
 
Rio-based center-right daily O Globo writes: "Approved by a 
commission in the Senate, due to strong pressure from Planalto [the 
Brazilian presidency] and the actions of business lobbies, Brazil's 
approval of Venezuela's entry to Mercosul could be voted on in the 
coming days. (...) There are those in Brasilia who consider the 
Chavist regime to be a democracy simply because it holds elections 
and referendums. This is a mistake because democracy is more than 
that: it allows freedom of speech and freedom of the press, legal 
security and independent and solid republican institutions. None of 
these exist in Venezuela. Other fallacious arguments try to pretend 
that the increasing volume of Brazilian exports to Venezuela (...) 
could become even bigger if Ch????vez receives a free pass to sit 
among the current partners in the trade bloc. This could happen 
independently of the results of the vote in the Senate. For this, 
Venezuelan economy just needs to expand --which, by the way, will 
be difficult, given the crisis of the Chavist economic model (...). 
Mercosul needs to resume strategic commercial negotiations with the 
European Union and begin them with other regions of the world, 
including the U.S., with the advantage of not giving Ch????vez veto 
power (...) The GOB, time and again, proposes to resume the Doha 
round (...). Without Doha, there are just bilateral negotiations 
and in them Ch????vez will act as an obstacle. (...) In case there 
are 
any doubts on the issue, one should analyze the dividends obtained 
by Brazil in accepting the Chavist project of smuggling Zelaya back 
to Honduras and converting the Brazilian Embassy into a bunker for 
agitation and propaganda against the interim government of Roberto 
Micheletti. Dividends, only negative ones, including for Lula 
himself, who is a partner in a project that only aims to convert 
Honduras into a Bolivarian possession. Alliances with Ch????vez are 
contagious."  (Dec 7, page 6)
