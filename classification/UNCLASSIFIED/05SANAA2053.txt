SUBJECT: WOMEN'S GROUP PROTESTS MOAYAD RULING, SEEKS 
HUMANITARIAN PARDON 
 
 
¶1.  On July 26, the ROYG-supported Yemeni Women's Union (YWU) 
staged a sit-in at their Sanaa headquarters to protest the 
U.S. verdict against Sheikh Moayad.  Moayed was found guilty 
of providing material support to terrorists by a U.S. federal 
court in March.  Following the peaceful protest, a group of 
YWU representatives including Moayed's daugher Khadijah met 
briefly with CDA to deliver letters addressed to President 
Bush, the Department of Justice, and Ambassador. 
 
¶2. The women called for Moayad's release on humanitarian 
grounds due to his age and poor health. Their letter, asking 
the U.S. to "redress the injustice against Moayad and release 
him immediately," was also signed by all major Yemeni 
political parties and several leading non-governmental 
organizations.  The women told CDA that Moayad's release 
would "sustain our belief in the U.S. as the world's 
preeminent supporter of justice and human rights." 
 
¶3.  Post will forward the letters to President Bush and DOJ 
via pouch.
