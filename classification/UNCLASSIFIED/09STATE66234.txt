SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050083308 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050083308 for the export of 
rifles to Russia.  Post is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 45 days. Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: The Department's Bureau of Democracy, 
Human Rights, and Labor requested that PM/DTCC establish the 
bona fides of end-user, MXM Hunting Club. 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Post is requested to verify that the 
rifles listed below were received by the MXM Hunting Club 
(NOTE: This export license expired before the company could 
export all the firearms listed on the license, so only 99 
rifles should have been exported).  Post is also requested to 
establish the bona fides of the end-user by making inquiries 
to representatives of the company and appropriate local 
authorities.  The following points are included for guidance: 
 
(To MXM Hunting Club) 
 
--When was your company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What products and services does your company provide?  Who 
are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
--What are you annual sales of U.S.-origin firearms? 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
(To Local Authorities) 
 
--Is MXM Hunting Club properly authorized to import and sell 
defense articles in Russia? 
 
--Do you have any information on MXM Hunting Club that would 
question their reliability as a recipient of U.S. defense 
articles? 
 
In its reply, Post is encouraged to comment on any 
information pertinent to this transaction such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
