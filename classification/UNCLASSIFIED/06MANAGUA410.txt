SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK ON 
APPLICATION 05-985232 
 
REF: STATE 10444 
 
¶1. ECONOFF has performed the requested pre-license check on 
application 05-985232.  Giovanny's Gun Shop in Masaya, 
Nicaragua appears to be a thriving business selling weapons 
for legal, personal use.  The Nicaraguan National Police 
(NNP) confirmed that the gun shop is owned by Giovanny 
Francisco Solis, and is registered and approved by the 
Government of Nicaragua as a weapons and ammunition vendor. 
NNP and USG interagency name checks on the proprietor did not 
reveal any derogatory information.  Giovanny's Gun Shop has 
been in operation since July 2004.  During a site visit to 
the gun shop, ECONOFF verified that the business sells 
personal weapons and ammunition for hunting, shooting, and 
home protection as well as supplies for outdoors enthusiasts. 
 The shop is located on a busy commercial street and is open 
to the public.  An armed guard is posted at the entry way and 
the weapons and ammunition are well secured.  This is the 
business' first attempt to import weapons from the U.S.  The 
shop previously imported guns from the Austrian weapons 
manufacturer GLOCK.  The shop does not sell used weapons. 
 
¶2. Sales records show that the shop sells weapons almost 
exclusively to individuals and these sales are for only one 
weapon. One sale of multiple rifles was made to the retailer 
PRICESMART.  The request to import 270 rifles and shotguns is 
consistent with current sales levels for Giovanny's Gun Shop. 
 The business sold 19 weapons in January of this year, which 
is slightly higher than average monthly sales for 2005.  The 
business primarily serves people living in the cities of 
Masaya and Granada, as well as Department of Rivas.  The 
owner's intention is to increase sales by expanding his 
product line to include U.S.-manufactured weapons. 
 
¶3. Giovanny's Gun Shop showed evidence of complying with 
Nicaragua's stringent gun control laws.  A poster outlining 
the law's provisions is displayed prominently in the shop. 
Purchasers must verify their identity with a properly issued 
government ID card.  Complete biographic and address details 
of purchasers are recorded, maintained at the shop and 
submitted to the NNP.  The owner demonstrated that he is 
familiar and in compliance with regulations on United States 
Munition List (USML) items, including on re-exporting.  The 
gun shop does not yet have an importation license from the 
Government of Nicaragua because the owner is awaiting 
notification of approval for export from the United States. 
 
¶4. Comment: The owners were very forthcoming in answering all 
questions and cooperative in providing all requested records 
to ECONOFF even though the site visit was not announced in 
advance. In post's assessment, this company is a reliable 
recipient of the USML items listed in REFTEL.
