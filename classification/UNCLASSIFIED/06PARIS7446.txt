SUBJECT: UNESCO-MEETING ON PROMOTION OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) 
 
¶1.  Summary. A two-day workshop, "Re-engineering Development: 
Engendering ICT" was held November 13-14 at UNESCO.  Though 
sponsored by UNESCO, the event was organized by the Centers for 
Women and Information Technology; Women in Global Science and 
Technology; and the European Association of Women in Science, 
Engineering, and Technology.  Other sponsors included the National 
Science Foundation and several American technology companies. The 
workshop objective was to chart a course of action for projects and 
initiatives to promote the role of women and girls in the field of 
Information and Communication Technology (ICT). UNESCO officials 
contributed opening remarks, and a representative from the Science 
sector suggested a future partnership between a proposed task force 
and the existing UNESCO network of university chairs working in this 
area.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. The meeting, whose theme was "Global Efforts for Local Impact: 
Moving from Knowledge to Action," included breakout groups on the 
following topics: education through and with ICTs; workforce 
development, recruitment, and retention; entrepreneurship for small 
and medium-sized enterprises.  Desired outcomes of the event focused 
on the creation of new programs and collaborative projects 
associated with each of these three primary areas of concern. 
 
¶3. Claudia Morrell, Executive Director of the U.S. Center for Women 
in Information Technology, led a debate on the proposed creation of 
a five-year task force to achieve greater implementation of already 
existing instruments and projects on gender and ICTs, as well as to 
encourage progress on future initiatives. Participants debated the 
criteria for joining such a task force. 
 
¶4. Ms. Rene Clair of the Basic and Engineering Sciences division at 
UNESCO reminded participants that UNESCO has already organized a 
network of chairs from Sudan, Ctte d'Ivoire, Brazil, Argentina, 
Morocco, Burkina Faso, and Pakistan called the "Women, Science, 
Technology, and Development Network." She reiterated that this 
network is ready to work with the task force on mutually beneficial 
projects once the task force is created. 
 
¶5. During the final plenary session, the breakout groups presented 
ideas for several future projects. Russell Jones, Chairman of the 
Capacity Building Committee of the World Federation of Engineering 
Organizations, suggested that an electronic portal be created to 
ensure that these projects go forward in the future.  He also argued 
that future gatherings should be organized to coincide with other 
significant global events where task force members would already be 
present. 
 
¶6. Comment. Although this was not an official UNESCO event - it 
simply took place at UNESCO -- capacity building in the areas of 
water resources, basic science and math education and engineering 
have been priorities for the U.S. at UNESCO.  The aim of this event 
was to launch an effort to which UNESCO would potentially contribute 
by establishing networks and creating partnerships, including with 
the private sector.  This seems in line with the sort of role 
advocated for UNESCO by leading members of the U.S. science 
community.  In addition to these positive points, this event 
illustrates UNESCO's sometimes ad hoc approach to program planning. 
This event also illustrates the limits of cross-sector cooperation. 
The Deputy of UNESCO's Communication and Information (CI) Sector did 
not know about the event when asked, and was almost certain that no 
one from the sector had attended.  This is ironic, since the CI 
sector is one of the strongest proponents of cross-sector work at 
UNESCO, and its ADG chairs the UNESCO cross-sector working group on 
capacity building. 
 
¶7.  All of the issues highlighted above might be considered by the 
high-level panel that is currently reviewing UNESCO's Natural 
Science and Social and Human Sciences Sectors.
