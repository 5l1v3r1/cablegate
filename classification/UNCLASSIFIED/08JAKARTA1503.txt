LIKELY FALSE ALARM 
 
¶1. (U) Recent press reports of a human avian influenza (AI) outbreak 
in North Sumatra appear to be unsubstantiated. The AFP released an 
article entitled "Bird Flu Outbreak in Indonesia Kills Three" on 6 
August 2008. The article claims that three individuals from the 
Asahan district died, with another thirteen undergoing treatment for 
the malady. Bird flu was initially suspected because the illness and 
deaths came on the heels of a spate of poultry deaths. Conversations 
with administrators at Adam Malik Hospital and Asahan District 
Hospital, as well as public health officials, indicate that the 
individuals are probably suffering from another respiratory illness. 
According to the AI coordinator for northern Sumatra, the fact that 
the patients from the suspected cluster are improving with treatment 
all but guarantees that the cases are not AI. World Health 
Organization officers corroborate this finding. 
 
¶2. (U) The Ministry of Health (MOH) has sent a rapid response team 
to the area to investigate. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) staff are participating on this team. Samples from 
those currently ill have been sent, but have yet to arrive at the 
Indonesian government's National Institute of Health Research and 
Development (NIHRD). No samples were collected from the deceased 
individuals (contrary to press reports, only two people are believed 
to have died) and they were not observed by trained medical 
personnel prior to death. It is unclear if samples have been 
collected from the poultry.
