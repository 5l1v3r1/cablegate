SUBJECT: DVC Request - "The New Regionalism" 
 
 
¶1. Program Description: In Support of MPP Goal 07-04 
Economic Growth and Development, Post requests a video 
conference with Dr. Jing Huang, Senior Fellow in Foreign 
Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, who is an 
expert in Chinese policy and Asian security issues. 
 
¶2. Justification and Objective: We have been approached 
by the Asia New Zealand Foundation to provide a speaker 
for the launch of their second series of "Outlook" 
papers, which incorporate a panel discussion on the "new 
regionalism in the region" leading up to the East Asian 
Summit (first week of December) and which is generating 
considerable discussion in New Zealand.  Jing, an expert 
in Chinese policy and Asian security issues, is a former 
associate professor of political science and co-director 
of the Asian Studies Program at Utah State University, 
where he taught Chinese politics, Southeast Asian 
politics, Northeast Asian security, and East Asian 
political economy. In 2002-2003 he was a Shorenstein 
Fellow at the Asia/Pacific Research Center at Stanford 
University and a Fulbright Professor in Hong Kong.  He 
has taught at Harvard University and at Shandong 
University in China. 
 
It is widely accepted that New Zealand's future 
prosperity (and indeed the world's prosperity) is linked 
to China's growth and development.  The next decades in 
China will be interesting to watch and will be of great 
importance not only to New Zealand, but also to the Asia- 
Pacific region. 
Jing's credentials make him extremely well-placed to take 
part in this discussion.  He is the author of "China and 
Northeastern Asian Alliances: Approach, Policy, and 
Dilemma," "China's Taiwan Policy: Dilemma and Choice," 
and "The Increase in Regional Differences and Its Impact 
on China's Regional Stability."   He has also written 
numerous articles and book chapters on the Chinese 
military, US-China relations, China's Taiwan policy, 
North Korea nuclear issues, and other security issues in 
the Asia-Pacific region. 
 
¶3. Activity Date, Fiscal Year, and Quarter:  This is an 
FY06 program, which is requested for November 8; first 
quarter. 
 
¶4. Audience Expected:  To include academics, opinion- 
makers, policy-makers, economists, think-tankers, members 
of the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs 
(NZIIA), and the media.
