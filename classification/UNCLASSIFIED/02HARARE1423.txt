SUBJECT: INDEPENDENT EDITORS LAUNCH FORUM 
 
 
  ¶1.   Editors of five privately-owned mainstream newspapers 
      have launched a national editors' forum "to promote and 
      defend press freedom and free speech" in Zimbabwe.  The 
      Zimbabwe National Editor's Forum (ZINEF) was launched on 
      June 12 by editors Geoff Nyarota of "The Daily News," 
      Francis Mdlongwa of the weekly "The Financial Gazette," 
      Iden Wetherell of the weekly "Zimbabwe Independent," 
      Bornwell Chakaodza of the "The Sunday Standard," and Chiza 
      Ngwira, editor of the monthly magazine "Parade." 
 
  ¶2.   ZINEF's self-described mission is to challenge laws 
      that threaten media freedom and freedom of expression, and 
      to encourage the government to ensure transparency, 
      openness and accountability in public administration. 
 
  ¶3.   Meanwhile, an article carried in the June 13 edition 
      of the "Financial Gazette," reports that the independent 
      media in Zimbabwe are preparing to take the government to 
      court to challenge sections of the Access to Information 
      and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA).  The move comes two 
      days before a government deadline for the registration of 
      media organizations.  Under AIPPA, no newspaper, radio or 
      television station, advertising agency or journalist will 
      be allowed to operate after June 16 unless they are 
      registered with or accredited by the Media and Information 
      Commission.  However, the Media Commission has not yet set 
      up registration or accreditation processes, and Chairman 
      Tafataona Mahoso has said that the Commission will not take 
      immediate action against unregistered media organizations 
      or journalists.
