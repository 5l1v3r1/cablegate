SUBJECT: LEAHY VETTING REQUEST: ANP RANK REFORM OF REGIONAL 
COMMAND-WEST (PART TWO OF THREE) 
 
¶1. This is an action request; please see paragraphs 2 and 3. 
 
¶2. In order to comply with Leahy vetting requirements, this cable 
forwards the names and biodata of fifty (50) Afghan National Police 
(ANP) field grade officers selected for positions in the Regional 
Command-West.  When there are individuals with one name, Post has 
made a good faith effort to ensure that these individuals actually 
only have one name.  This is the second of three cables. 
 
¶3. IMPORTANT NOTE:  The international community recently approved 
pay increases for ANP company grade officers (captains and 
lieutenants); however, pay increases for the field grade ANP 
personnel will not be approved until completion of Rank Reform. 
Currently, ANP field grade personnel earn less than their Afghan 
National Army (ANA) equivalents, a situation that is causing severe 
morale problems.  Completion of the ANP Rank Reform process will 
significantly alleviate deteriorating morale, which is why Post 
requests the Department's expedited vetting and response at the 
earliest possible date.  Post greatly appreciates Department's 
strong support for completing the ANP Rank Reform process.
