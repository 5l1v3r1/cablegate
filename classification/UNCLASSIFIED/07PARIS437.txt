SUBJECT: LITTLE FRENCH REACTION TO USDA PROPOSED FARM BILL 
 
 
¶1.  Reaction among French authorities and media to the recent 
announcement by USDA of its Farm Bill proposal has been minimal.  To 
date, the daily economic newspaper "Les Echos" has been the only one 
dedicating a full article on this topic providing primarily factual 
info as compared to policy analysis.  The article does cite positive 
reactions by Oxfam America and environmental organizations. The 
website www.pleinchamps.com also mentioned USDA Secretary's 
announcement and summarized the proposals, commenting that the U.S. 
Congress will be unwilling to accept such proposals. 
 
¶2.  The GOF, including the French Minister of Agriculture, and 
private form organizations, including the powerful farmers unions, 
have not yet issued a reaction.  (Note:  National elections within 
the French Chambers of Agriculture this week could have delayed any 
reaction.  End Note.) When questioned, the Ministry of Agriculture 
responded that it will let the European Commission comment on U.S. 
farm policy proposals. 
 
¶3.  Most French press articles on farm policy this week focused on 
the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) more than domestic U.S. 
agricultural policy with an emphasis on the French Agricultural 
Minister's recent clash with EU Trade Commissionner Peter Mandelson 
on rumors of new EU farm proposals. Today, "Le Figaro" daily 
newspaper published a long article on the U.S. Congress' "increased 
protectionism" relative to the former Congress without mentioning 
the Farm Bill specifically.  We expect the media's interest to 
intensify as DDA discussions proceed.  Post will continue to closely 
monitor and report on this issue.
