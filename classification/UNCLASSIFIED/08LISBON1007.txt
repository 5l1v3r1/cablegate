Poleconoff delivered reftel demarche points to the Ministry 
of Finance Office of Planning, Strategy, Evaluation and 
International Relations, GOP lead for the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), outlining Turkey's 
change of status request and soliciting GOP support for a 
strategic review of the EBRD mandate before the Bank's 
decision.  Multilateral Relations Division Chief Rosa Caetano 
speculated whether the review of the EBRD scheduled as part 
of Capital Resources Review 4 in 2010 might be an appropriate 
time to take up the question, but deferred providing a GOP 
position.  Caetano said she understands the USG position but 
emphasized that European Union member states coordinate 
responses to such questions, and the Ministry must defer 
providing a position pending discussions with EU colleagues. 
Caetano indicated she will be attending the annual meeting of 
the Asian Development Bank next week and anticipates 
discussing Turkey's EBRD request with EU colleagues at that 
time.
