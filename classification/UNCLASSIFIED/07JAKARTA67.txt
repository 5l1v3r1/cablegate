Pertamina Raises Industry LPG Price 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Effective December 13, state-owned oil and gas company Pertamina 
raised the price of bulk liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for medium 
and large manufactures by 10.8 percent from Rp 5,280 ($0.58) per 
kilogram (kg) to Rp 5,852 ($0.64) per kg.  Pertamina spokesman 
Toharso said that the move would cut losses Pertamina incurs by 
selling LPG below the price it purchases it from suppliers. 
Pertamina said it would try to avoid increasing the price of LPG for 
households and smaller industries through the end of the year. 
 
Pertamina To Secure Local Loans For Eight Projects 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶8. During its December 12 general shareholders meeting, Pertamina 
management agreed to secure a loan of $500 million from a local bank 
consortium including Bank Mandiri and Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI). 
The proceeds of the loan will finance eight oil and gas projects 
commencing in 2007.  Newly appointed Pertamina Board of 
Commissioners Chairman Endriartono Sutarto said that the bank 
consortium had initially offered $1.4 billion, but Pertamina decided 
to obtain only $500 million.  Pertamina Director for Finance 
Frederick T. Siahaan told the press that a portion of the loan 
proceeds will finance the Cepu Block development project ($50 
million), the construction of the Kamojang Geothermal Power Plant 
Unit 4 ($80 million), and the development of Pondok Tengah field in 
Bekasi, West Java.  Pertamina will also use a portion of the loan to 
purchase eight 70,000 deadweight tonnage capacity oil tankers; build 
a primary transit terminal in Tuban, East Java; and revamp several 
oil refineries, including those in Balongan and Cilacap on Java 
Island, and another in East Kalimantan. 
 
Aceh Flooding Affects Oil Production 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶9. Severe flooding in Aceh and North Sumatra Provinces starting on 
December 22 has significantly affected Pertamina's Rantau upstream 
oil production operations located in the border area of the two 
provinces, according to the company.  Pertamina partially suspended 
operations in Rantau where, as of December 25, 98 percent of its 
facilities were flooded by water.  Rantau is a mature Pertamina's 
oil and gas field operation, which has been supplying gas to North 
Sumatra's Belawan power plant at a declining rate.  The flooding has 
also affected facilities at the Arun block gas fields in Aceh owned 
 
JAKARTA 00000067  004 OF 005 
 
 
by ExxonMobil.  In spite of the floods, ExxonMobile has been able to 
continue its production activities at full capacity. 
 
Tender For Coal-Fired Power Plants 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶10. State-owned electricity company Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) 
on December 18 opened tenders for the construction of 25 coal-fired 
power plants outside Java Island.  The tenders are part of the GOI's 
"fast track" program to build an additional 10,000 watts of 
electricity generating capacity by 2009.  Pre-qualification 
documents for construction of power plants on Java Island allow 
tender participants to provide 85 percent of project funding in the 
form of export credits.  However, the pre-qualification invitation 
for coal-fired power plants outside Java Island allows tender 
participants to propose financing through any form of export credit 
scheme or local financing to cover the entire project cost.  PLN 
Director for Finance Parno Isworo, however, said that funding 
schemes for the construction of coal-fired power plants outside Java 
Island are still under discussion. Head of the "fast track" 
program's implementation team Yoga Pratomo added that PLN would 
cover some of the projects' cost by issuing bonds through Indonesian 
banks.  PLN raised $1 billion through an international bond issuance 
in October. 
 
PLN Appoints Contractor To Build Power Plant 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶11. On December 14, publicly listed engineering and electricity 
company Truba Alam Manunggal (Truba) and Hong Kong-based Shanghai 
Electric Generation Group Co. Ltd. (SEG) signed an MOU agreeing to 
jointly build and operate a 2x125 megawatt, $200 million coal fired 
power plant in Kuala Tanjung, North Sumatra.  PLN directly appointed 
SEG to develop the power plant. Head of the local mining and energy 
office Washington Tambunan said that PLN made the direct appointment 
due to the acute electricity crisis in the province.  Truba 
President Director Arifin Wiguna said construction of the power 
plant would start in January 2007 and begin commercial operation in 
¶2008.  He noted that his company would soon sign an agreement 
whereby PLN would purchase electricity from the plant at $4.5 cents 
per kilowatt-hour (KwH).   Earlier in November, Truba and SED signed 
another MOU with local company Central Pertiwi Bahari to build a 
2x25, $60 million coal fired power plant in North Lampung. 
 
Natural Gas Sellers And Buyers Sign Agreements 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶12. Pertamina subsidiary Pertamina Eksplorasi & Produksi (Pertamina 
EP), Korean oil and gas firm Kodeco Energy, and Indonesian energy 
company Lapindo signed seven supply contracts on December 19 for 
695.8 trillion British thermal units (TBTU) of gas, of which roughly 
79 percent will be allocated for gas-fired power plants in Java. 
Total value of the agreements is $2.8 billion.  Upstream oil and gas 
authority BP Migas Chairman Kardaya Warnika said he hopes the 
agreements will encourage other production sharing contracts (PSCs) 
aimed at meeting domestic gas supply requirements.

¶13. Elsewhere, BP Migas said in a December 19 statement that it had 
facilitated a Cargo Loading Agreement between PT Pertamina EP and 
state-owned fertilizers PT Pupuk Iskandar Muda (PIM) in Aceh and PT 
Pupuk Kalimantan Timur (PKT) in East Kalimantan.  Under the deal, 
Pertamina will swap a total of 8.9 TBTU of gas or about 3 cargoes of 
liquefied natural gas (LNG), which was previously allocated for PKT, 
to support the operation of PIM.  According to the BP Migas 
statement, the swap will begin in January 2007 and support the 
operation of the PIM fertilizer plant for six months. 
 
Kalimantan Gold And Oxiana Close Deal 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶14. According to press reports, Bermuda mining company Kalimantan 
Gold Corporation Limited (KGC) announced on December 18 that it had 
finalized an option agreement with Australian copper and gold mining 
company Oxiana Ltd. for exploration of Kalimantan's copper and gold 
prospects.  The agreement covers three key areas, Baroi, Beruang and 
Mansur, which form part of KGC's 941 square kilometer holdings in 
Central Kalimantan. Under the agreement, Oxiana will reportedly 
initially invest $2.5 million to drill 12 deep prospecting holes 
over a period of twelve to eighteen months. Oxiana then has an 
option for taking a 40 percent stake in completing a pre-feasibility 
study and an option for a 66.7% stake for completing a bankable 
feasibility study.  If any of the projects proceed to the mine 
development stage, the deed allows Oxiana to provide significant 
funding assistance for financing KGC's share of mine development. 
KGC reportedly starting working on the Kalimantan project in 1996, 
and has reportedly invested to date roughly $12 million for the 
drilling of 70 prospecting holes.
