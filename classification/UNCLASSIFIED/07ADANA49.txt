SUBJECT: SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY FOR APRIL 04, 2007 
 
 
This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for April 04, 
Â¶2007.  Please note that Turkish press reports often contain 
errors or exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for 
the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
 
POLITICAL 
 
BOLGE:  Despite the court verdict which issued that the term 
of office of the mayor of Karatas district in Adana should be 
discontinued on grounds that his assembly membership was already 
dropped before he took up office in the days that followed the 
murder of the Karatas mayor last September, Karatas mayor 
refuses to leave his seat and still continues to hold office. 
CHP Adana provincial party organization will file a petition 
with the Adana Governor's Office today to demand enforcement of 
the court verdict. 
 
EVRENSEL:       Thousands of people protested the arrest of Cizre 
Mayor Aydin Budak (from DTP) in front of the mayor's office in 
Sirnak's Cizre district.  Budak was recently arrested reportedly 
on grounds that he made a speech that drew attention to the 
health condition of Abdullah Ocalan during Newroz celebrations 
in Cizre on March 21.  People also held a sit-in protest on the 
main road nearby the mayor's office.  Many of the people in town 
did not open their businesses throughout the day.  The daily 
also reports that four municipality assembly members, including 
the deputy district mayor, were detained later, as well. 
 
RADIKAL / EVRENSEL / ZAMAN:     Diyarbakir Prosecutor's Office 
called for 15 years prison sentence against 53 of 56 mayors in 
the southeastern region because of the letter Diyarbakir Mayor 
Osman Baydemir sent on behalf of the other mayors to Denmark's 
Prime Minister Rasmussen in December 2005 in support of the 
broadcasts of pro-PKK Roj TV in Denmark.  (Note: Radikal daily 
noted that the court called for a 10 year prison sentence.) 
 
SECURITY 
 
HURRIYET:       As a result of a joint operation carried out by 
Turkish and Syrian security forces within the territory of Syria 
before PM Erdogan's trip to Damascus, six terrorists and the 
leader of the PKK located in Syria, were captured and arrested. 
 
CRIME AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 
 
 HURRIYET (CUKUROVA) / RADIKAL: A total of 227 foreign 
nationals, who have illegally entered the country on foot 
through Turkey's border with Iran, were caught and arrested by 
jandarma teams in Van's Baskale district.  Forty of them are 
Afghanis, 144 of them are Pakistanis, 42 of them are 
Bangladeshis and one of them is from Iraq.
