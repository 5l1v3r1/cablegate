SUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL CONTRACT CORRUPTION TASK FORCE HELPING 
SUCCESSFULLY COMBAT CORRUPTION IN AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1. Current levels of corruption in Afghanistan undermine security, 
development, and rule of law objectives, damage the legitimacy of 
the Afghan government, and contribute to the country's illicit 
narcotics trade.  At a recent interagency presentation in Kabul, the 
work of International Contract Corruption Task Force (ICCTF) showed 
the positive role it plays in U.S. Mission anti-corruption efforts 
in Afghanistan. 
 
¶2. The ICCTF is an integrated group of U.S. civilian and military 
law enforcement organizations, including the Defense Criminal 
Investigative Service, U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command - 
MPFU, FBI, Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction 
(SIGAR), and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, among 
others.  In operations in Iraq, Kuwait, and in Afghanistan, the 
ICCTF works closely with these partner investigative and law 
enforcement agencies.  With 27 agents and auditors based at Bagram 
Airbase, Camp Eggers in Kabul, and in Kandahar, ICCTF in Afghanistan 
investigates contract fraud and public corruption related to U.S. 
government funds. 
 
¶3. Since July 2006 when ICCTF began operations in Afghanistan, it 
has conducted more than 30 investigations involving American and 
Afghan defendants.  Prosecutions have included violations for public 
corruption (e.g., bribery and kickbacks), procurement fraud (e.g., 
false claims, labor mischarging, and undelivered or defective 
goods), and theft.  Case resolution statistics for both Iraq and 
Afghanistan include: 64 criminal convictions, USD 97 million paid to 
the U.S. in restitution, USD 6 million levied in fines and 
penalties, and USD 10 million seized or forfeited. 
 
¶4. The ICCTF plays a significant role in USG efforts in the fight 
against corruption, in particular by setting an example for Afghans 
by aggressively detecting and investigating corrupt contracting 
practices involving U.S. taxpayer funds.  Building understanding of 
the importance of self-policing will be an important aspect of 
developing anti-corruption work in Afghanistan.
