SUBJECT: LEBANON:  ISRAELITE COMMUNAL COUNCIL BOARD OBTAINS GOL'S 
RECOGNITION 
 
¶1.  (U) On May 15, the Israelite Communal Council obtained the 
Ministry of Interior's (MOI) official recognition of its newly 
elected board.  The Board was elected on February 28 for a six-year 
term, but the MOI had delayed giving the Council its validation. 
Due to the difficulties in obtaining the MOI's validation every 
three years, the Council elected its board for a six-year term 
instead of its usual three-year term. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On April 16, Isaac Arazi, newly elected chairman of the 
Council, and Semari Behar, board secretary, informed us about the 
MOI's delay in granting approval and requested Embassy assistance. 
According to Arazi the MOI's approval is necessary for the Council 
to manage and run its finances as well as the properties of the 
Jewish community living in Lebanon.  Embstaff then met with Minister 
of Interior Hassan Sabaa to intervene on the Council's behalf and 
encourage the MOI to complete the validation process, which it did 
on May 15. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Israelite Communal Council was established in the 1920s. 
 The council manages the finances and properties owned by the Jewish 
Lebanese community.  Additionally, it manages several synagogues 
located in Beirut, Bhamdoun, and Aley, and the Jewish cemetery in 
Beirut.  According to Arazi, there are approximately 100 Lebanese 
Jews currently living in Lebanon.  (Note:  The voters' registration 
list of 2005 shows that there are approximately 6,000 Jewish voters 
in Lebanon.  End note.) 
The council also is preparing to renovate the synagogue located in 
downtown Beirut with funding provided by the Jewish Lebanese and a 
small amount from Solidere, a Beirut downtown real estate 
development company. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) This is not the first time that the Council has faced such 
difficulties with the MOI.  With every election, Post is approached 
by the Council with a request for assistance in expediting the 
validation process.  Post twice helped the council on when previous 
boards were elected in 2002 and 2005.  End Comment.
