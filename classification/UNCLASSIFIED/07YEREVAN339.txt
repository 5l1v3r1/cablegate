REF: YEREVAN 328 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  The March 20 Iran-Armenia pipeline inauguration ceremony, led by 
Presidents Kocharian and Ahmadinejad, offered surprisingly little 
fodder for Armenian media.  The ceremony was short.  The two 
presidents did not deliver their prepared remarks, apparently 
because of bad weather at the outdoor site. (Rain and fog had 
delayed Ahmadinejad's arrival by several hours.)  No transcripts 
have been released of the presidents' remarks, nor have the 
undelivered prepared speeches been released publicly in Armenia.  As 
of close of business March 20, neither the presidency nor MFA 
websites have posted any mention of the visit, or of Iran issues. 
 
¶2.  The brief outdoor ceremony featured the lighting of a symbolic 
torch, and then the two leaders retreated indoors to the nearby 
customs house for an hour-long meeting, first with delegations 
present and then one-on-one.  The two then held a very brief press 
availability.  The press conference consisted of just two questions; 
Armenian and Iranian public television were permitted to pose one 
question each, to the irritation of the assembled Armenian press 
corps.  Ahmadinejad then promptly headed home with his delegation. 
 
¶3.  Energy Ministry contacts confirmed that the two energy ministers 
signed an agreement formalizing a previously-initialed plan to build 
a pair of hydro-electric power plants on the Arax River, one on the 
Armenian side and the other on the Iranian side.  The hydro plants 
are to be financed by Iran, which will be repaid in electricity. 
 
¶4.  The few comments quoted in local media were mostly empty, 
feel-good rhetoric.  The exception was an oblique remark President 
Kocharian made that the two "friendly countries" had each agreed to 
do nothing that the other one would regard as threatening to its 
security.  This comment was difficult to find mentioned in print 
sources, though it aired in television coverage.  Kocharian also 
noted that Armenians remember the goodwill the Iranian people and 
authorities have showed it during its 15 years of independent 
history, drawing a contrast with Soviet-Iranian relations which were 
"connected only by barbed wire."  Kocharian noted that 600,000 tons 
of cargo had crossed the Iranian-Armenian border last year.  The two 
presidents spoke in very general terms about cooperation in various 
spheres including energy, water, infrastructure, communications, and 
trade.  President Ahmadinejad remarked that the bilateral projects 
between the two countries were investments in regional stability and 
security.
