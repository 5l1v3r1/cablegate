SUBJECT: CANADA JOINS UNSC IN CONDEMNING ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: Canada endorsed a United Nations Security Council 
(UNSC) statement on June 24 condemning the Government of Zimbabwe 
for its actions during the current presidential election period. 
Canada stated that violence by Zimbabwean state agents had 
"contaminated" the election, called for the engagement of African 
leaders, pledged to promote firm action against the current 
Zimbabwean government, and called on Zimbabwean authorities to 
cooperate in finding a peaceful solution to allow the rebuilding of 
Zimbabwe and the restoration of regional stability in Southern 
Africa.  End summary. 
 
 
¶2. (U) Minister of Foreign Affairs David Emerson issued a statement on 
June 24 welcoming the engagement of the UNSC in the electoral 
situation in Zimbabwe.  In particular, Canada agreed "fully" with 
the UNSC presidential statement on June 23 condemning the actions of 
the Government of Zimbabwe, including its conclusion that the 
results of the March 29 elections must be respected.  Canada 
endorsed the assessment by opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai that 
conditions in Zimbabwe will not allow for free and fair elections to 
take place on June 27 and stated that "the Government of Zimbabwe 
will not be legitimate without a free and fair vote." 
 
¶3. (U) Further, Canada said the "alarming" campaign of human rights 
violations and politically motivated violence, committed largely by 
state security and paramilitary groups, and restrictions on the 
opposition's ability to campaign freely, have "contaminated" the 
electoral environment.  Canada re-emphasized the importance of the 
engagement of African leaders, particularly those in neighboring 
countries, in ensuring respect for democratic principles agreed to 
by these African countries. 
 
¶4. (U) Canada endorsed the UNSC's call on Zimbabwean authorities to 
cooperate fully with all efforts to find a peaceful way forward, 
through dialogue between the parties, to allow the formation of a 
legitimate government that reflects the will of the people of 
Zimbabwe.  Canada pledged to continue to work with others to promote 
firm action against the current Zimbabwe Government.
