  Editorial Quotes

¶1. GREEN DAM SOFTWARE 
 
"Green Dam software; an American company plans to sue over 
plagiarism" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/15): "Recently, China has fulfilled its 
promise to open its network.  This has received global compliments. 
A U.S. IT giant has grasped the opportunity to create a fuss over a 
normal business action.  They have brought this to a political level 
in order to attack China.  Installing internet filter software is a 
regular behavior in international society.  The U.S., Germany and 
other developed countries all install internet filters, what's more, 
China's Green Dam can be uninstalled if the users wishes.  Attacking 
China on this issue is completely unreasonable and is driven by 
commercial profit." 
 
¶2. EASTERN TURKISTAN 
 
a. "A small country risks being a part of the troubles of big 
countries" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/15): "A Chinese expert recently said that 
small international countries do not have many choices.  They can 
take advantage of the conveniences provided by large countries, 
keeping a balance, maintaining their independence and remaining 
neutral.  However, Bermuda and Palau are too small and they have 
little independence.  They are more like tribes.  The leaders are 
like tribe leaders, dealing with national issues like an internal 
family affair.  They lack the judgment of mature politicians.  When 
the U.S. offers them benefits, they are willing to make certain 
political exchanges.  These countries are short-sighted." 
 
 
b. "The U.S. spends $200 million USD to sell the Eastern Turkistan 
prisoners" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(06/15): "The U.S. 
always ignores the protests of the Chinese Foreign Ministry and 
U.S.-China cooperative agreements.  These men pose a threat to 
China's border security.  China requested the U.S. stop transferring 
these terrorists to third countries and instead send them back to 
China as soon as possible.  The logic of the U.S., that China will 
persecute the prisoners when they return is completely robber's 
logic.  A Chinese expert suggested that if they were sent back, they 
would be brought to a just and transparent judicial trial.  However, 
on the contrary, being handled by the U.S., they were living a 
miserable life in Guantanamo prison.  This is not the first time 
that the U.S. has used human rights as an excuse to house these men. 
 This reflects the complexity of the U.S.-China relationship.  The 
two countries still have many divergences on many issues.  The UN 
has listed Eastern Turkistan as terrorists.  As these men turn into 
a burden for Obama, they can hardly be used by the U.S. to contain 
China." 
 
¶3. TIBET 
 
"It is difficult for the U.S. to setup a Tibet affairs section in 
China" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(06/15): "The U.S. 
recently passed a bill authorizing the U.S. Embassy in China to open 
a section for Tibetan affairs.  This move intends to interfere in 
China's internal affairs.  The U.S. always wanted to put a wedge in 
Tibet.  It has adopted a three-step plan: establishing a position 
called 'Tibet affairs coordinator'; allocating $5 million USD to set 
up a consulate in Tibet; and the U.S. congress has passed a bill 
related to the issue.  The Tibet affairs section is only a 
transition to the Tibet consulate.  Tibet-related organizations are 
the force behind the bill.  The Press Section of the U.S. Embassy in 
Beijing said that it hadn't been notified by the U.S. Department of 
State.  Chinese experts believe that the U.S. needs to use the Tibet 
issue as a card to balance China.  An American scholar indicated 
that the U.S. is unwilling to offend China during the financial 
crisis.  Therefore, like always, the Department of State may act 
perfunctorily on this inappropriate bill of the U.S. congress."
