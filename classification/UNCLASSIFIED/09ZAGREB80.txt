SUBJECT: CROATIA PROBABLY WILL SUPPORT US REGARDING 
POTENTIAL ARTICLE 16 RESOLUTION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 12900 
 
Poloff delivered reftel demarche points on February 12, 2009 
and followed up on February 13, 2009 regarding the Potential 
Article 16 UN Security Council Resolution to Vesna Vukovic, 
head of the MFA's UN office.  She took note of our position 
and said that she would forward the U.S. views regarding the 
need to defeat a potential resolution to her colleagues in 
New York for consideration.  She noted that Croatia, in 
general, is against article 16 resolutions, but a final 
decision would not be taken until an internal discussion took 
place with their mission in New York.  Post will report any 
substantive response in a septel, but it would seem that 
Croatia's New York mission will take the lead on this 
decision, which allows for direct engagement by USUN.
