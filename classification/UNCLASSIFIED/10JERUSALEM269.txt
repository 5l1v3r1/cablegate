SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (02/12): Israeli air raids on the 
Gaza strip kill 2 people, injure 3 children 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
The dailies run front page news on Israeli air raids on the Gaza 
Strip. Reports note that 2 people died and 3 children were wounded. 
Al-Quds leads with a headline saying "Israeli forces escalate 
violence" (in Gaza). Within these stories, the dailies report on 
settlers "invading" Eastern Nablus to visit Joseph's Tomb and their 
attack on Haj Mazooz Girls' School, breaking windows, doors and 
water pipes. 
 
The dailies report that Nabil Sha'ath concluded his visit to Gaza by 
meeting with Egyptian officials to discuss the results of his 
meetings with Hamas leaders. It is reported that he also discussed 
this with US and European ambassadors. Sha'ath is quoted saying that 
Egypt is comfortable with the results of his trip and that there 
will be no new dialogue before Hamas signs the Egyptian 
reconciliation plan. 
 
Al-Quds reports that the U.S. is looking into moving some of its 
military equipment and weapons from Iraq to Israel. The headline of 
the story says that the equipment and weapons are worth $800 million 
and that the Israeli army could use them in the case of an 
emergency. 
 
Al-Quds also reports that Iran will produce the first package of 
highly-enriched uranium. The headline quotes Iranian President 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad saying that "Obama is missing chances and 
serving Israel's interests." 
 
The dailies report that Israel started re-routing part of the 
separation barrier's route in the village of Bil'in in the West 
Bank. In related news, Al-Ayyam continues to report on the 
re-occupation of the Oush Al-Ghorab area in Beit Sahour. The 
headline claims that the IDF will confiscate 400 dunums of land. 
 
------------ 
BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
 
Firas Yaghi opines on Ma'an under the title "Policy of the Extortion 
Negotiations" saying: "It is clear that the Israeli-Palestinian 
negotiations have been exhausted. Resuming negotiations will not 
change anything, because what was agreed on before was not executed 
in the first place. Talks should start under the auspices of the 
Arab League...and the Arab peace initiative. Palestine is a member 
of the Arab League and its case is central for Arabs. Whoever wants 
peace has to achieve it with all the Arab states... The Arab League 
is responsible for negotiations."

Palestinian Cyberspace: 
----------------------- 
 
In her report on Obama banners in the Gaza streets posted on 
Palestinenote.com (about banners hung throughout Gaza by the BBC 
asking what President Obama has accomplished in his first year), 
Mariam Hamed says: "President Obama has talked endlessly about 
Palestine, and yet nothing has been done.  Words must be followed by 
actions, and the people of Gaza want results from Obama. Still 
Gazans have hope of achieving something this year and ask the world 
a question: When will we have peace, and when will we have a state? 
Hopefully this is a question Obama will answer."
