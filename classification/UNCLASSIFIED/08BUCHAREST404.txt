¶1. (U) The prominent news daily "Romania Libera" (circulation 
316,000) May 21 carried op-ed under the Ambassador's by-line 
expressing solidarity with the people of Cuba.  The 
commentary recalled similar regimes in the former communist 
states of Eastern Europe that were now defunct, and 
highlighted the suffering of political detainees under the 
repressive Cuban regime. 
 
¶2. (U) Mission is also pleased to report that the popular 
Carturesti Book and Tea Shop held a reception on May 21, 
commemorating of their photographic exhibition: "It is our 
problem, too -- the women of the prisoners of the Cuban 
Spring," which is running through June 5.  The exhibit is run 
in association with the Human Rights Documentary Film 
Festival running in Bucharest, from May 16-June 1.  The very 
moving "It is our problem, too" photo exhibition is sponsored 
by the People in Need Foundation and the Konrad-Adenauer 
Stiftung with support from the Hungarian Cultural Center and 
the Romanian Peasant Museum.  The introductory narrative 
states: 
 
"In mid-March 2003, while the world turned its attention to 
the start of the war in Iraq, Fidel Castro used the cover 
created by the war to arrest 75 human rights defenders, 
independent journalists, librarians and opposition members. 
In April, the arrested activists were subjected to hasty and 
unfair trials, and quickly sentenced to an average of 20 
years in prison.  the families of these prisoners of 
conscience are also suffering the consequences of the 
government crackdown.  Prisoners' family members are often 
abused and threatened by authorities, and in some cases 
members of local communities have been turned against the 
families.  The family members are also serving a sentence, a 
price they are paying at home."
