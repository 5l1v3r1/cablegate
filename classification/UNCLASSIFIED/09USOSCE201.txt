¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The fall round of the OSCE's Forum for 
Security Cooperation (FSC) opened on September 9 with a 
presentation by a British FCO official on the strategic 
relevance of FSC issues in the global security context. 
Meanwhile, the USDel drew attention to the draft UNSCR 1540 
Best Practice Guide, which is expected to receive the initial 
consensus it needs in a FSC working group as soon as 
September 16.  Belarus provided information on its upcoming 
combined Belarus-Russia-Kazakhstan exercise "West-2009."  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The 2009 Fall round of the FSC opened under the 
chairmanship of the United Kingdom, with Ambassador Ian Cliff 
chairing.  The Chair's opening remarks were followed by a 
presentation from Mr. Paul Johnston, Director of 
International Security of the UK and Commonwealth Office, on 
the strategic relevance of FSC issues in the global security 
context.  Johnston's remarks reiterated familiar themes while 
describing old and new security threats, including the 
relationship between the impasse on A/CFE and stalemate on 
Vienna Document, the importance to the UK of CFE and 
relevance of FSC in dealing with emerging threats such as 
proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and threats to 
cyber security. (Full text of Johnston's presentation as well 
as AMB Cliff's opening remarks may be found in 
FSC.JOUR/593/09, annexes 2 and 1 respectively.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Johnston's remarks were followed by a number of 
general statements, including from the U.S., welcoming the UK 
Chairmanship and congratulating the outgoing Georgian Chair. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Under Any Other Business, the U.S. (Neighbour) 
called participating States' attention to FSC.DEL/145/09 
(UNSCR 1540 Best Practice Guide: Export Controls and 
Transshipment--Final Review), which was distributed in the 
FSC on July 21. Neighbour asked that the decision be 
forwarded to the Working Group (WG) for rapid adoption. 
(Comment. The UK Chair has since placed the decision on the 
agenda of WG A and plans to introduce the decision as a 
Chairman's draft (FSC.DD/8/09).  The UK plans to push for 
adoption of the DD in WG A next week with a view to ideally 
have the decision adopted at the following plenary on 
September 30.  End Comment.) 
 
¶5. (SBU) Belarus reported on its upcoming combined 
Belarus-Russia-Kazakhstan exercise "West-2009."  Belarus' 
statement and a preliminary translation were provided via 
separate channels.  The statement was distributed in Russian 
and English under FSC.DEL/153/09.  Ref A reports on USDel's 
execution of demarches requested (Ref B) regarding this 
exercise. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Chair announced that the FSC project 
coordinators for SALW, Stockpile Management and Code of 
Conduct remain unchanged.  The UK SALW Coordinator (Hartnel) 
reported the completion of Phase II of the Tajik project. 
Hartnel also appealed to pS for additional contributions for 
the Belarus project.  Finally, he noted that the Kazakh 
project is in the final stages of development and that he 
will soon be seeking donor support.  The Danish Stockpiles 
Coordinator (Peterson) noted that a new project in Kazakhstan 
 
USOSCE 00000201  002 OF 002 
 
 
had been entered into the system.  In addition, the Moldovan 
project has been uploaded. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The next FSC Plenary will be held on September 16, 
followed that morning by the first meetings of the working 
groups for the Fall round.   The UK will chair all FSC 
plenary meetings through December.
