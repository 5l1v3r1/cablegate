¶1. (U) Per paragraph four of Ref. A, post adapted S/GWI's suggested 
op-ed for relevance to Tunisia, condensing it and noting that 
"Tunisia has a long tradition of protecting women's rights for which 
it can be justifiably proud, but violence is a global problem and it 
requires international solutions."  The reputable and widely read 
newspapers As-Sabah (Arabic-language daily) and its sister 
French-language daily Le Temps, which have a combined daily 
circulation of 90,000 readers, published front-page headers about 
the editorial on December 2. 
 
¶2. (U) The articles mentioned Ambassador Gray by name and title in 
the byline, and each featured a photo of the Ambassador downloaded 
from the Embassy's public website both on the front and inside 
pages.  The op-ed, which was printed in full using the Embassy's 
provided translation, called for the elimination of all forms of 
violence against women while praising Tunisia for its strong history 
of support for women's rights.  Accordingly, the headline in 
As-Sabah read, "Tunisia has a long tradition of protecting women's 
rights for which it can be justifiably proud", and the headline in 
Le Temps was "Elimination of violence against women in the world: 
Tunisian secular traditions for the protection of women's rights." 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Tunisian Association of Democratic Women (ATFD) called 
Post's Human Rights Officer to praise the Ambassador's editorial, 
and stated that while the international community and activists tend 
to focus discourse on a "male-centric" version of human rights, her 
association was glad to see the Ambassador speak specifically and 
publically about the rights of women.  Additionally, several foreign 
diplomats working on human rights in Tunisia communicated their 
pleasure at seeing the op-ed.
