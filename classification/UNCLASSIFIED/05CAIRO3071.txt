¶1. Quarterly/Annual Update 
 
(U)  The Cairo Regional Security Office is making good 
progress in creating a viable Country Council.  We have had 
monthly meetings for the past four months, characterized by 
an active and candid exchange of new ideas and company 
initiatives. The Country Council is a dynamic council with 13 
core organizations and an average of 19 participants. 
 
(U) Recently, DRSO George Tietjen attended a OSAC/ISMA/SISBO 
Regional Security Conference in Dubai from the 20th to the 
22nd of March, during which he participated on a regional RSO 
panel addressing the economic impact of security on the 
private sector. 
 
¶2. Key Events and Significant Activities 
 
(U) The RSO office has taken full advantage of the website 
upgrades and plans to introduce this valuable tool during the 
next country council meeting scheduled for the 14th of April, 
¶2005. DRSO Tietjen will also brief the Country Council on the 
Dubai Regional Security Conference as well as the latest 
developments in the recent Cairo bomb attack. 
 
¶3. Issues and Concerns 
 
(U) Many  council members are concerned about the recent 
bombing in a popular Cairo marketplace. This event and its 
ramifications for the private sector business, will no doubt 
be a central topic of next Thursday's meeting. 
 
¶4. Outlook 
 
(U) Country Council meeting scheduled for April 14th, 2005. 
 
(U) The Cairo Country Council is looking forward to hosting 
the regional conference Egypt next year.
