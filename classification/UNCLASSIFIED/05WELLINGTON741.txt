On September 19 and 23, Acting DCM discussed reftel 
conference invitation with Deborah Panckhurst, Deputy 
Director of the Disarmament Division in the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  Panckhurst said that MFAT 
was keen to have someone attend the conference.  She 
cautioned, however, that they may not be able to spare anyone
