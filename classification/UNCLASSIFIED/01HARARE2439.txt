¶1.   THE CHARGES AGAINST THE FOUR JOURNALISTS FROM THE 
    INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" WERE CHANGED LATE ON AUGUST 16. 
    THE FOUR JOURNALISTS (EDITOR GEOFF NYAROTA, DEPUTY EDITOR 
    BILL SAIDI, NEWS EDITOR JOHN GAMBANGA AND REPORTER SAM 
    MUNYAVI) ARE NOW CHARGED WITH "DISTRIBUTION OR CIRCULATION 
    OF A SUBVERSIVE STATEMENT," A VIOLATION OF SECTION 44 
    (2)(B) OF THE LAW AND ORDER MAINTENANCE ACT (LOMA). 
 
¶2.   THE FOUR WERE ORIGINALLY CHARGED WITH PUBLISHING A 
    REPORT THAT COULD CAUSE "FEAR, ALARM OR DESPONDENCY AMONG 
    THE PUBLIC," A VIOLATION OF SECTION 50 (2)(A) OF THE LOMA. 
    THAT CHARGED WAS DROPPED WHEN POLICE REALIZED THAT THE 
    ZIMBABWEAN SUPREME COURT HAD DECLARED SECTION 50 
    UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN 2000.  THE FOUR WERE THEN CHARGED WITH 
    CRIMINAL DEFAMATION OF THE ZIMBABWE REPUBLIC POLICE.  THAT 
    CHARGE WAS DROPPED WHEN THE JOURNALISTS' LAWYER MADE THE 
    CASE THAT ONLY INDIVIDUALS, NOT INSTITUTIONS, CAN LEGALLY 
    BE DEFAMED. 
 
¶3.   THE FOUR JOURNALISTS REMAIN FREE ON PERSONAL 
    RECOGNIZANCE.  NO COURT DATE HAS BEEN SET.
