SUBJECT: MWANAWASA ON ZIMBABWE:  CHILDREN BEHAVING BADLY 
 
 
According to May 15 reports in Zambia's state-owned 
newspapers, President Mwanawasa announced that the Southern 
African Development Community (SADC) will not expel Zimbabwe 
from the regional economic community or solve the problems in 
Zimbabwe with force, which he said would only hurt the 
Zimbabwean people.  Mwanawasa reportedly stated that 
Zimbabwe's expulsion from the Commonwealth prevented 
Commonwealth members from "effectively participating" in 
Zimbabwe's affairs.  "We are not going to fall into the same 
trap.  Zimbabwe will continue to be a member and a child of 
SADC.  When a child makes a mistake, you cannot disown him." 
Mwanawasa added that SADC had undertaken "a critical 
initiative" by holding the emergency summit on April 12, 
calling for the immediate release of election results, and 
defining, through the summit communique, how Zimbabwe should 
conduct the run-off elections.  He said that SADC leaders are 
seeking to persuade Tsvangirai to participate in the 
run-offs.
