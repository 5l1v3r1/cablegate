Summary 
------- 
¶1.  Michelin senior representatives contacted Embassy 
to urge U.S. participation in the next Michelin 
Challenge Bibendum that will take place in Paris from 9 
to 12 June 2006. This event, which has gained 
international recognition as the premier "clean and 
safe vehicle event" worldwide provides an international 
platform for road vehicle manufacturers, energy 
suppliers and technology providers to demonstrate state- 
of-the-art solutions.  High attendance is expected. 
The Embassy views this event as an opportunity for U.S. 
agencies (e.g., DOE, EPA, DOT, OSTP, CEQ and STATE) to 
give greater visibility to U.S. contributions and 
achievements in research towards sustainable mobility. 
End summary. 
 
The Bibendum Event: "Clean Cars Now!" 
------------------------------------- 
¶2.  Challenge Bibendum was created in 1998 to celebrate 
the one-hundredth anniversary of "Bibendum" (Michelin 
corporate icon known as the "Michelin Man").  This 
annual event was specifically designed to encourage 
technical advances that will secure energy supply, 
protect the environment and improve road safety for 
future generations.  Conceived as a concrete way to 
bring together and test the best available technologies 
for road-safe and environmentally-positive vehicles, 
Challenge Bibendum features vehicles from major vehicle 
manufacturers on all continents and brings together 
major stakeholders of auto-mobility: vehicle 
manufacturers and designers, energy and technology 
suppliers, academia, opinion leaders, government and 
non-government organizations.  U.S. agencies have 
participated in past events and U.S. technical 
presentations are reflected in exposition proceedings. 
After Los Angeles, Heidelberg, San Francisco, Shanghai 
and Kyoto, the Challenge Bibendum 2006 will be held in 
Paris, June 9-12. 
 
2006: A special year 
-------------------- 
¶3.  The Paris event is organized around three themes: 
 
-- What are the primary energies and energy carriers 
for the vehicles of the future? 
 
-- What solutions do the new technologies bring to the 
issues of urban and suburban mobility? and 
 
-- What are the contributions and limitations of the 
new technologies to improving road safety? 
 
Besides thematic round tables to debate technical and 
regulatory developments, technical tests, and ride and 
drive opportunities, the organizers have also planned a 
rally in the heart of Paris as an opportunity to meet 
with the general public, showcase and demonstrate 
concrete examples of new technologies, and heighten 
awareness to the current evolutions worldwide. 
 
¶4.  Strong international participation and attendance 
expected: For the first time, the Challenge will be 
organized in partnership with the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development.  Representatives 
from the EU have been invited and the European 
institutions are committed to participate actively. 
Furthermore, the Michelin event has been positioned 
immediately prior to the 16th World Hydrogen Energy 
Conference in Lyon, France, (13-16 June) in order to 
make participating in both events easier and to build 
synergy. 
USG Participation in the event 
------------------------------ 
¶5.  Michelin has informed Embassy that written 
invitations for Challenge Bibendum have been extended 
to Energy Secretary Bodman, Transportation Secretary 
Mineta, and EPA Administrator Johnson.  We understand 
OSTP Director John Marburger, John Connaughton, 
Chairman of the White House Council on Environmental 
Policy, Jacqueline Glassman, Deputy Administrator of 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and 
National Science Foundation Director Arden Bement, are 
among the - or will be - invitees. 
 
¶6.  With respect to what the USG can show in Paris, 
Michelin officials highlighted U.S. efforts that have 
been made on hybrids, fuel cell vehicles, and 
alternative fuels.  Road safety is a key aspect of 
Challenge Bibendum 2006 and a presentation detailing 
U.S. efforts to promote road safety in the U.S. and to 
assist other nations as they attempt to deal with this 
problem would be most welcome. 
 
Comment: An opportunity for U.S. diplomacy 
------------------------------------------ 
¶7.  Many French citizens discount the role of the U.S. 
government in developing efficient, climate-friendly 
technologies.  The Embassy considers the June 2006 
event as an excellent opportunity for USG 
representatives to promote specific U.S. technological 
innovations related to automobile efficiency.  U.S. 
officials and experts who may be interested in 
participating should contact: ESTH Counselor Robert 
Dry, email: dryrw@state.gov; tel: (France area code) 
(0)1 4312 2589 and Stephen Evered, Michelin North 
American Director Govt Affairs, tel: 864 458 5080,
