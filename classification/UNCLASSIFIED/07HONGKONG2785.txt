1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
accompanied by Commercial Officer Brock Wilson, conducted a post 
shipment-verification (PSV) at Huawei Technology Co. Ltd., 9/F, 
Tower 2, Ever Gain Plaza, Tower 2, Hong Kong (Huawei Hong Kong). The 
items in question are various integrated circuits exported to Huawei 
Hong Kong on or about March 23, 2007 and valued at USD 10,902.  On 
the applicable shippers export declaration (SED), these items are 
classified under export control classification number (ECCN) 3A001 
and, if properly classified, would be controlled for national 
security (NS) reasons.  The exporter was Xilinx Inc. of San Jose 
California. 
 
¶3.  A search of Huawei Hong Kong's web page reveals that Huawei is a 
unit of mainland company Huawei, a well-known worldwide 
telecommunications network hardware manufacturer.  The company has a 
range of product portfolios including mobile network, broadband, 
IP-based, optical network, telecom valued added service and 
terminal.  More information is available at the company's web site, 
www.huawei.com. 
 
¶4.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Huawei Hong Kong 
was registered in 1992.  Its paid up share capital is the Hong Kong 
equivalent of USD 40,000.  Hong Kong identity card holders Ma, 
Cheung Hon and Ma, Cheung Kwai are listed as directors. 
 
¶5.  On October 17, 2007, ECO and Commercial Officer, Brock Wilson 
met with Mr. Dickson Law, Warehouse Supervisor.  He stated that 
Huawei Hong Kong acts as a logistics hub for Huawei production 
facilities in Shenzhen and elsewhere in mainland China.  The company 
has no production facilities in Hong Kong and, as a result, items 
exported/reexported to Hong Kong can be expected to be sent to 
mainland China production facilities.  Mr. Law stated that Huawei 
Hong Kong is well aware of U.S. and Hong Kong export controls and 
has special staff dedicated to those controls. 
 
¶6.  As to the specific items in question, ECO notes that documents 
provided by OEA indicate that the items in question are likely 
classified under ECCN subparagraph 3A001A7A.  This subparagraph is 
subject to a license requirement to mainland China but is eligible 
for a license exception is sent for civil end-use (license exception 
CIV). 
 
¶7.  During the October 17, 2007 meeting, Mr. Law stated that he 
would provide confirmation that the items had been forwarded to 
Huawei production facilities.  By subsequent e-mail, Mr. Law 
provided documentation confirming that the items had been shipped 
through to the company's Shenzhen production facilities.  He 
provided further confirmation that the items were destined for civil 
end-use at the company's headquarters in Shenzhen.  Finally, he 
provided a copy of the Hong Kong export license covering the 
reexport to mainland China.  That license includes a civil end-use 
requirement. 
 
¶8.  At the time visited, it appeared that Huawei Hong Kong has 
procedures in place for complying with U.S. and other export 
controls.  It further appeared that the items had been forwarded to 
Huawei's facilities in Shenzhen.
