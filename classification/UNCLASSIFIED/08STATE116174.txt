SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN PRE-LICENSE END USE CHECK ON 
APPLICATION 05-050127753 
 
REF: MOSCOW 1653 
 
¶1.  This is an action message.  See paragraphs 2-7. 
 
¶2.  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post assistance in conducting a 
pre-license check for the export of radiation tolerant DC/DC 
converters to Russia.  Post is requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of response to a 
Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3.  Reason for request: this license application is a 
re-submittal of a case that was Returned Without Action due 
to a previous Blue Lantern check that was closed unfavorably 
because the Russian entities involved in the transaction 
refused post inquiries (reftel).  The U.S. applicant has now 
provided specific points of contact for these Russian 
entities. 
 
¶4.  The Russian entities listed on this license application 
had no previous licensing history with our office.  The 
requested commodity is designed for use in low earth orbit 
satellites and launch vehicles.  The license application 
states that the commodity will be used in a fire alarm and 
security system (FASS) at a nuclear power plant. 
 
¶5.  ACTION: Please contact the Foreign End User, Russian 
Agency for Atomic Energy, to determine if they can confirm 
this specific order for components, and the use of these 
components by the Foreign Consignee TENZOR for a FASS 
intended for the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant. 
 
¶6.  Contact the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant.  Inquire 
with Novovoronezh to ascertain if they can confirm this 
specific order for components, and the use of these 
components by the Foreign Consignee TENZOR for a FASS 
intended for the plant. 
 
¶7.  Finally, please contact Foreign Consignee JSC Instrument 
Plant TENZOR.  Ask TENZOR to explain why they need radiation 
tolerant satellite components for the FASS of Novovoronezh (a 
FASS is usually not located in radioactive areas).  Also ask 
TENZOR if all of the requested components will be used in the 
Novovoronezh plant FASS, or were any extra components ordered 
for stockpiling and use on another program?  END ACTION.
