(U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Antra Tumane, of the MFA's 
Middle East and Africa Division.  Tumane stated that, although the 
GOL supports the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) politically, due 
to Latvia's current financial situation, the MFA would likely not be 
able to contribute funding for years two and three.
