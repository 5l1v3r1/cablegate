SUBJECT: SOUTHEAST TURKEY PRESS SUMMARY FOR JUNE 25, 2007 
 
 
¶1.      This is the Southeastern Turkey press summary for June 25, 
¶2007.  Please note that Turkish press reports often contain 
errors or exaggerations; AmConsulate Adana does not vouch for 
the accuracy of the reports summarized here. 
 
POLITICAL: 
 
¶2.      BOLGE / ZAMAN:  National Chairperson of Workers' Party, 
Dogu Perincek, held a political rally in Adana and made 
anti-U.S. and anti-Incirlik remarks during his address to a 
crowd of supporters under intense summer heat. 
 
¶3.      ZAMAN:  The daily observes election trends in 
Sanliurfa province and reports that AKP, DP, and independent 
candidates are holding strong positions there.  According to the 
paper, MHP is only influential in the city center.  The social 
structure of the province turns out such that instead of 
parties, the clans in the province will compete bitterly among 
each other, because AKP enlisted two clan leaders in its 
ticket's first and second ranking slots, and DP enlisted another 
influential clan leader on its own ticket.  It is estimated that 
two DTP-supported candidates will also win seats in the 
parliament from Sanliurfa. 
 
SECURITY 
 
¶4.      ZAMAN / SABAH / HURRIYET / BOLGE / GUNDEM:      The papers 
reported on Sunday that two terrorists held a suicide attack at 
8 p.m. on Saturday at Karsilar Jandarma station in Tunceli and 
attempted as they strayed from the main road to drive into the 
station with an oil tanker as they blew themselves up with 
explosives.  Meanwhile, terrorists located at a firing range in 
a forest area around the station opened fire.  The jandarma 
retaliated.  The papers report that terrorists initially killed 
the driver of the tanker to seize it. (This is from June 24 
edition.) Gundem daily claims on its Monday (June 25) edition 
that the security personnel opened fire at a tanker as it was 
traveling towards Ovacik district and passed by a jandarma 
station.  The daily claimed that two civilians in the tanker, 
one of whom was the driver, were killed in the explosion. 
Gundem daily claims that the fire that resulted from the 
explosion at the jandarma station was taken under control later. 
 
¶5.      GUNDEM: A tip-off, which claimed that a suicide bomber 
would blow him/herself up at the Ataturk Dam in Sanliurfa, 
allegedly caused the authorities to limit the number of visitors 
to the dam.  Sanliurfa Governor, who dismissed suicide bomber 
rumors, said that they imposed a certain ban on the number of 
visitors because of the regular security measures taken in the 
run-up to the elections. 
 
¶6.      GUNDEM: The police in Tunceli reportedly started 
distributing brochures in the province with the following title: 
"No to Terrorism, Yes to Love and Friendship."  The brochures 
reportedly explained current threats to the society and 
described ways people could help security forces to resolve 
those threats. 
 
¶7.      ZAMAN / GUNDEM: Two persons, who were allegedly members 
of Hezbollah in Turkey, were reportedly detained in Van. 
 
¶8.      SABAH / ZAMAN / BOLGE:  Van Police found 47 pistols, two 
of which were Glock brand, in hidden sections of a car in Van. 
The driver of the car turned out to be a village guard and the 
pistols were being delivered to the PKK.  Police are also 
interrogating another village guard and two PKK members in 
connection with PKK related arms dealing. 
 
CRIME AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 
 
¶9.      ZAMAN / BOLGE / EVRENSEL / HURRIYET (CUKUROVA): 
Eighty-seven people, illegal migrants including Indians, 
Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, were caught by police in two 
separate operations carried out in Adana.  Bangladeshis set off 
from Iran, arrived in Van on foot and were in transit to 
Istanbul, reported the daily. 
 
CULTURE / SOCIETY / ENVIRONMENT 
 
¶10.     HURRIYET (CUKUROVA):    Twenty-nine women were recently 
provided microloans to assist them in self-employment projects 
in Sanliurfa, said the Mayor of the province (This summary is 
from June 23 edition).
