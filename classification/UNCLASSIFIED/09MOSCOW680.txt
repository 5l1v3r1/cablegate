¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Electrocomplect, 
Korolev, Moscow Region, Russia. The company is listed on BIS license 
application: NLR as the ultimate consignee of 50 electronic 
integrated circuits and micro assemblies. These items are controlled 
for national security, missile technology, nuclear proliferation and 
anti-terrorism reasons under ECCN 3A001. The licensee is Actel 
Corporation, 2061 Stierlin Ct, Mountain View, California. 
 
¶3. On February 19, 2009, ECO Moscow LES Natalya Shipitsina spoke 
with the Artem LNU (last name unknown), the POC provided in reftel 
as the ultimate consignee.  Artem LNU advised LES Shipitsina that he 
was the intermediate consignee, not the end user.  Artem LNU advised 
LES Shipitsina that he would contact Electrocomplect and arrange for 
the end use check and a POC.  Later that same day Artem LNU advised 
LES Shipitsina that he spoke with Irina Treister of Electrocomplect 
and was told the export control team could contact her directly to 
arrange for the end use check. 
 
¶4. On March 2, 2009, LES Shipitsina spoke with Irina Treister of 
Electrocomplect, and was told that she must contact Denis Podolko, 
Sales Director for Electrocomplect, and request a meeting for the 
end use check. 
 
¶5. On March 12, 2009, after speaking with Denis Podolko on several 
occasions and explaining the basis for the requested end use check 
with Electrocomplect, LES Shipitsina was advised by Denis Podolko 
that Electrocomplect would not meet with the export control team, 
and further advised that the ultimate end users of the reftel 
commodity are strictly confidential and would not be divulged to the 
export control team. 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post cannot/cannot recommend Electrocomplect, 
Korolev, Moscow Region, Russia as a reliable recipient of sensitive
