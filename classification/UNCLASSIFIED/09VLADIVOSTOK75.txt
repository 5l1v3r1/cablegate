SUBJECT: US NAVY SHIP VISITS VLADIVOSTOK FOR INDEPENDENCE DAY 
 
¶1.  The U.S. Navy Destroyer USS STETHEM made a port visit to 
Vladivostok July 1-6, marking the second visit by a navy ship to 
Vladivostok since May.  American sailors from the ship 
participated in a number of community relations events, 
including a "dragon boat" race, and officers from the ship and 
ConGen Vladivostok took part in official meetings.  Ship 
Commander Shan Byrne and the Consulate hosted an Independence 
Day reception on board. 
 
¶2.  Commander Byrne made several official calls, including 
meetings with Vladivostok Mayor Igor Pushkaryov and Deputy 
Russian Pacific Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Nikolay Maryasov. 
The Commander also hosted a dinner on board the ship for local 
naval officers, attended a reception aboard the Russian naval 
ship Admiral Vinogradov, and laid a ceremonial flower garland at 
the Russian Pacific Fleet Battle Honors Memorial.  Some ship 
officers and the Consul General attended an international 
scientific conference entitled "Political Confidence and 
Security Building in Northeast Asia." 
 
¶3.  Sailors took part in several community relations events, the 
highlight of which was an international two-day dragon boat race 
tournament.  Stethem sailors and Consulate staff represented the 
U.S. in races against Russian, Chinese, and Australian teams. 
The ship also fielded basketball, track and field, and 
volleyball teams to take on various Vladivostok university and 
youth teams, and played soccer against the Russian Pacific Fleet 
team.  Additionally, sailors and officers visited a local 
children's cancer ward and the Mayak Children's Center, where 
sailors made renovations to the playground, played with the 
children, and presented gifts.  The Stethem hosted Russian 
Pacific Fleet sailors, regional officials and a group from the 
Mayak Children's Center for a tour of the destroyer. 
 
¶4.  Comment.  The visit of the USS STETHEM, which came only two 
months after the Victory Day visit of the USS COWPENS, is a 
significant indicator that mil to mil relations are improving. 
Both visits were covered extensively in the media, and public 
interest remains high.  ConGen Vladivostok strongly supports 
these ship visits and looks forward to further outreach 
opportunities with Embassy Moscow's support.
