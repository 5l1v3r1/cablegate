SUBJECT: AFGHAN HEROIN PRECURSOR CHEMICALS -- INSTRUCTION FOR 
FRENCH DRAFT RESOLUTION 
 
¶1.  The Department requests that USUN welcome the French 
draft resolution on chemical precursors of heroin in 
Afghanistan and express our appreciation to the French for 
their efforts to address this problem.  USUN should 
support the text of the draft resolution provided by the 
French, as copied in paragraph 3, with minor edits to clarify 
that the resolution deals with chemical precursors of heroin, 
not chemical precursors writ large. 
 
¶2.  USUN should refer any subsequent substantive changes 
to the Department for guidance, and recall the 
Department's initial red lines, which the French have 
already taken into account, in considering the text at the 
expert level and in the Council: 
 
-- the resolution should call on further cooperation 
within the framework of existing UN drug control 
conventions and the International Narcotics Control Board, 
as reflected in OPs 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 12; 
 
-- any actions by the Secretary General to appoint 
additional experts to examine the issue should be done 
within existing resources, as reflected in OP 12. 
 
-- the Afghan government should support the resolution, as 
it has indicated in its support for the current draft. 
 
¶3. Begin text: 
 
The Security Council,

2003 (S/PRST/2003f7), 
 
¶2. Reaffirming its resolutions 1267 (1999),1373 (2001) and 
1735 (2006), and reiterating its support for international 
efforts to combat terrorism in accordance with 
international law, including the Charter of the United 
Nations, 
 
¶3. Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, 
independence, territorial integrity and national unity of 
Afghanistan, 
 
¶4. Reaffirming its continued support for the Government 
and people of Afghanistan as they rebuild their country,

constitutional democracy and assume their rightful place 
in the community of nations, 
 
¶5. Noting with concern the close connection between 
international terrorism and transnational organized crime, 
money laundering, trafficking in illicit drugs and illegal 
arms, and in this regard emphasizing the need to enhance 
coordination of efforts on national, subregional, regional 
and international levels in order to strengthen a global 
response to this serious challenge and threat to 
international security, 
 
¶6. Reiterating its concern about the security situation in 
Afghanistan, in particular the continued violent and 
terrorist activities by the Taliban, Al-Qaida, illegal 
armed groups, criminals and those involved in the 
narcotics trade, and the links between illicit drugs 
trafficking and the insurgency, 
 
¶7. Stressing once again the serious harm that the high 
level of opium cultivation, production and trafficking 
causes to the security, development and governance of 
Afghanistan as well as to the region and internationally, 
 
¶8. Recognizing the efforts of neighboring countries to 
address the impact on the region of the production of 
illicit drugs in Afghanistan, including through

¶11. Recalling that achieving a sustained and significant 
reduction in the production and trafficking of narcotics 
with a view to eliminating the narcotics industry has been 
identified as a cross-cutting priority by the "Afghanistan 
Compact" adopted in London in 2006, which provides the 
framework for the partnership between the Afghan 
Government and the international community, as well as the 
Government of Afghanistan's National Drug Control 
Strategy, 
 
¶12. Urging States that have not done so to consider 
ratifying or acceding to, and State parties to implement 
fully the multilateral treaties whose aim is to fight 
against the illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs, notably 
the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 
1961, as amended by the Protocol of 25 March 1972 and the 
United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in

Convention), and underlining the importance for all States 
parties to these treaties to implement them fully in order 
to promote international stability, 
 
¶13. Expressing utmost concern at the increase of illegal 
smuggling to and within Afghanistan of chemical precursors 
needed to produce heroin, in particular acetic anhydride, 
noting that most of the opium produced in Afghanistan is 
now processed in the country, and stressing the need to 
better implement the system of monitoring and notification 
of the international trade in chemical precursors of heroin 
established by the 1988 Convention so as to prevent the 
diversion from licit channels to illicit traffic of 
substances, 
 
¶14. Recalling the Political Declaration adopted by the 
General Assembly at its twentieth special session, In 
which Member States decided to establish the year 2008 as 
a target date for States to eliminate or significantly 
reduce, inter alia, the diversion of precursors of heroin, 
 
¶15. Acknowledging the role of the Commission on Narcotic 
Drugs of the Economic and Social Council as the global 
coordinating body in international drug control, and
