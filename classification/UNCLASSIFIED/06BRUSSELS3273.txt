SUBJECT:  Belgians to Name Non-Resident Charge for 
Baghdad 
 
 
¶1. The Belgian government will shortly appoint a non- 
resident Charge for Baghdad, according to Ambassador 
Robert Devriese, the MFA's Acting Director-General for 
Bilateral Relations.  Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht 
took the decision on September 27, Devriese told 
polcouns and visiting EUR/UBI Office Director 
Gallagher, adding that the appointment will soon come 
into effect.  Belgium's DCM in Amman, Jeroen Vergeylen, 
will take up the post.  Vergeylen currently deals with 
Iraqi matters from his base in Amman. 
 
¶2. There are no immediate plans for Vergeylen to travel 
to Iraq, according to Christian Monnoyer, the MFA's 
Director for Middle Eastern Affairs.  Monnoyer noted 
that security concerns are likely to keep the idea of 
opening a mission in the Iraqi capital "off the table" 
for a considerable period.  In expressing pleasure at 
this news, polcouns indicated the U.S. would continue 
to press for accreditation of an Ambassador and the 
opening of a mission in Iraq.
