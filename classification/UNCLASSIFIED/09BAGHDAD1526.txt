SUBJECT: Strategic Framework Agreement Landmark Met with GOI 
Contribution Doubling Fulbright 
 
¶1. (U) In a ceremony on June 10 announcing the $2.5 million 
contribution of the GOI to the Fulbright Program, both DPM Barham 
Salih and the Ambassador lauded the contribution as an important 
milestone in the implementation of the Strategic Framework Agreement 
and the ongoing transition of bilateral cultural and educational 
ties. This contribution doubles the size of the Iraqi Fulbright 
Visiting Student Program from 35 to 70 grants for 2010 and makes the 
GOI the eighth largest foreign government contributor to the 
Fulbright Program. 
¶2. (U) Nine of the Fulbright students scheduled to depart for the 
U.S. this summer spoke briefly about their placements to 
universities throughout the U.S. and their enthusiasm to return to 
Iraq once their programs are completed. 
¶3. (U) Seven local television stations as well as Reuters, AFP and 
NINA covered the event. We will report press coverage by June 12. 
¶4. (U) PAS will scan and send signed copies of the MOU (as provided 
by ECA/A) to commence the transfer of funds from the Government of 
Iraq to AMIDEAST, the designated program institution for the Iraq 
Fulbright Program.
