SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050119285 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050119285 for the export of 
titanium plating to France.  Post is requested to complete 
this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of response to 
a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Unfamiliar foreign end-user Marphil 
International (Marphil).  The company has appeared on 
previous licenses but its bona fides have not been verified 
by a Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION PARIS: Post is requested to make inquiries with 
host government officials to establish the bona fides of 
unfamiliar foreign end-user, Marphil, and to confirm that 
end-use is as stated on the license application.  PM/DTCC 
requests that post conducts a site visit to Marphil in order 
to provide Department with an assessment of its business 
operations and on-site security.  Finally, post is asked to 
assess whether the company appears to be a reliable recipient 
of USML items.  If a site visit is not possible, please 
inform the PM/DTCC officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling USML items? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for this USML item? 
 
--What is the nature of the company and when was it 
established?  Who are its principals? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer and re-export? 
END ACTION
