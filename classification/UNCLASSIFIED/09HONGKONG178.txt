¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. At the direction of the Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of 
the USDOC Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted a pre-license check (PLC) at 
the Hong Kong Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority, 9/F 
Revenue Tower, 5 Gloucester Road, Hong Kong (Authority). The items 
in question are various Juniper firewall products. These items are 
classified under export control classification number (ECCN) 5D002 
and are controlled for national security (NS) reasons. 
 
¶3.  The Hong Kong Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority 
is Hong Kong's broadcasting and entertainment regulatory agency.  It 
grants various licenses and sets various standards in the 
entertainment and broadcasting sphere.  More information about this 
agency can be found at www.tela.gov.hk. 
 
¶4.  On January 20, 2009, ECO and Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan 
visited the Authority and met with Billy Lam, Information Technology 
Officer.  He provided background on the transaction in question 
including the underlying contract with intermediate consignee, 
Datacraft China/Hong Kong in respect of the equipment.  Mr. Lam 
stated that Datacraft is a well-known and longtime IT provider to 
the Hong Kong government. Mr. Lam stated that the items will be used 
in the creation of a two tier firewall system at the Authority to 
allow for remote access by up to 20 employees (although that may be 
expanded at a later time).  Mr. Lam was open and forthcoming with 
the applicable information concerning the order and the Authority. 
 
¶5.  Based on the information noted above, ECO believes that the 
Authority is a suitable recipient of U.S. origin controlled 
technology.
