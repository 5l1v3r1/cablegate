SUBJECT: CPE LAW DECLARED CONSTITUTIONAL -- CHIRAC TO 
ADDRESS NATION TOMORROW 
 
REF: A. (A) EMBASSY PARIS SIPRNET DAILY REPORT FOR MARCH 
 
        30 AND PREVIOUS 
     ¶B. (B) PARIS 2048 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) At 2000 local time March 30 France's Constitutional 
Council announced that it had decided that the Equal 
Opportunity Law -- including its controversial First 
Employment Contract (CPE) article -- did not/not violate the 
constitution (refs A and B).  According to initial press 
reports, the court approved the CPE law "without reserve," 
which means that  President Chirac may now promulgate the law 
at any time during the next nine days.  President Chirac will 
address the nation tomorrow March 31, in all liklihood to 
communicate his intention to promulgate the law, or announce 
that he has already done so, and to call an "employment 
summit" to include representatives of all parties concerned. 
 
¶2.  (U) Initial reaction from opponents of the CPE was 
predictable and swift.  Francois Chereque, head of France's 
most progressive trade union federation, the CFDT, 
immediately declared that he would not attend such a 
conference.  Chereque summed up the position of those who 
have been leading the protests (ref A and B) against the CPE: 
that the measure must be withdrawn to be submitted to 
negotiation with worker and student representives.  Francois 
Hollande, First Secretary of the Socialist Party said that if 
President Chirac promulgates the law, "he is opening himself 
to facing a test of strength." 
 
¶3.  (U) Should Chirac follow through, backing his prime 
minister by promulgating the law, then the first round of the 
upcoming test of strength will likely be next Tuesday, April 
4, a day on which opponents of the CPE have called for 
another round of demonstrations and strikes.
