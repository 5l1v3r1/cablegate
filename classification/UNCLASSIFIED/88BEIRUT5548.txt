ATTENTION| 
 
PURSUANT TO THE POSITIVE INITIATIVE PROPOSED TO SOLVE 
THE ISSUE OF THE HOSTAGES AND THE SUBSEQUENT RESPONSES 
OF THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION, THE ISLAMIC JIHAD FOR 
THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE ORGANIZATION ANNOUNCES THE 
FOLLOWING: 
 
FIRST - THERE WILL BE NO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE AMERICAN 
ADMINISTRATION.  THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS ENDING THE HOSTAGE 
ISSUE IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR NEGOTIATIONS.  RATHER, IT 
COMES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MORAL AND HUMAN VALUES THAT 
WE BELIEVE IN.  THE DAY WILL NEVER COME THAT WE 
NEGOTIATE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF KILLING AND CRIME. 
FOLLOWING A CAREFUL, ATTENTIVE AND RESPONSIBLE STUDY OF 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLITICAL DETENTE IN THE REGION, 
HOWEVER, WE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MOVE THIS DEVELOPMENT 
FORWARD WITH A POSITIVE INITIATIVE REGARDING THE HOSTAGE 
ISSUE, WHICH CONSTITUTES BOTH A PROBLEM AND A SOLUTION 
IN THE CONTEXT OF REGIONAL EVENTS. 
 
THIS IS A CHANCE FOR THE LEADING PERSONALITIES OF THE 
AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER AND THINK 
RESPONSIBLY OF THE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF THIS ISSUE, FOR 
THIS IS A CHANCE THAT MAY NEVER COME AGAIN.  ALL WE ASK 
IN RETURN IS WHAT IS STIPULATED BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS PACT 
(SIC) REGARDING THE INTIFADA OF OUR HEROIC PALESTINIAN 
PEOPLE ON THE ONE HAND, AND NHAT IS REQUIRED BY THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF SUPPORTING THE DETENTE WHICH HAS BEGUN 
IN THE REGION, ON THE OTHER. 
 
SECOND - THE JUST CAUSE OF OUR PEOPLE IS PART OF A 
GREATER WHOLE; THE SUPPORT OF LEGAL RIGHTS IS PART OF A 
GREATER WHOLE, AND THE ISSUE OF THE USE OF POWER AND 
VIOLENCE OR INITIATIVES OF PEACE AND STABILTY ARE ALSO 
FUNDAMENTAL.  THIS IS THE BASIS OF WHAT IS ACHIEVED 
THROUGH OUR IDEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES.  WEAKNESS WAS NEVER 
AN INCENTIVE FOR CHANGING OUR COURSE AND POWER HAS NEVER 
FORCED ANY CHANGES.  WHAT IS NECESSITATED BY OUR 
PRINCIPLES AND FUNDAMENTALS IS WHAT WILL BE.  WE ARE 
ALWAYS PREPARED FOR VIOLENCE AND FOR CALM AND PEACEFUL 
ATTITUDES.  THIS IS A TIME OF POSITIVE RESPONSES.  DO 
NOT WASTE THIS OPPORTUNITY THROUGH HAUGHTY WORDS THAT 
PROVOKE US AND ENCOURAGE US TO DRAW BACK AND RESORT TO 
VIOLENCE AND FORCE TO GAIN RECOGNITION.  THIS ISSUE MUST 
BE SOLVED POSITIVELY AND THE ADMINISTRATION MUST ASSUME 
ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. 
 
THIRD - WE ARE ASTONISHED AT THE RIDICULOUS DEALS MADE 
BY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DUKAKIS IN ANNOUNCING THE 
TRANSFER OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM IN ORDER 
TO OBTAIN THE SUPPORT OF ZIONIST PRESSURE GROUPS IN THE 
ELECTIONS.  HE HAS BLATANTLY DEFIED THE FEELINGS OF OUR 
HEROIC PEOPLE AND THE MOSLEMS OF THE WORLD.  THIS 
FOREBODES A DARK FUTURE.  WE DECLARE, HOWEVER, THAT 
JERUSALEM IS AN EVER-BURNING VOLCANO IN WHICH THE 
AMERICAN EMBASSY WILL MELT.  UNTIL THEN, WE HAVE VARIOUS 
POSITIONS.  WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THIS VIEW OF HIS 
(DUKAKIS) DOES NOT REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE.  THAT IS WHY IT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE 
HOSTAGE ISSUE, OVER WHICH ALL THE SUITABLE CONDITIONS 
FOR A SOLUTION ARE GATHERED. 
 
FINALLY, THE INITIATIVE IS STILL THERE AND EXISTS.  WE 
ARE WAITING FOR RESPONSES, IN THE LIGHT OF WHICH WE WILL 
DECIDE SUBSEQUENT STEPS, ON THE BASIS OF WHAT IS 
REQUIRED BY OUR GLORIOUS INTIFADA. 
 
PEACE BE UPON HE WHO SERVES THE TRUTH FOR THE TRUTH. 
 
(SIGNED) ISLAMIC JIHAD FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE 
ORGANIZATION.
