¶1. In the "3 in 1 elections" (REF A), the ruling DPP won 
city mayor/county magistrate seats in five cities/counties 
in southern Taiwan - Chiayi County, Tainan County (REF C), 
Tainan City (REF D), Kaohsiung County, Pingtung County.  The 
KMT won in Chiayi City (REF B) for the first time in 23 
years and kept its magisterial seat in Penghu County. 
Taitung County was won by an independent candidate who is 
still a KMT member.  This report will provide bio 
information for the newly elected Chiayi City Mayor, Chiayi 
County Magistrate, Tainan City Mayor, and Tainan County 
Magistrate. 
 
¶2.  Chiayi City Mayor - Huang Min-hui (F) (KMT) 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Born in 1959, Huang currently is one of the two incumbent 
Chiayi City Legislators.  She was elected in 1999, 2001 and 
¶2004. 
 
Huang holds a BA from National Taiwan Normal University. 
She trained as a teacher at Taipei's Chungshan Girls' High 
School before she was elected as a National Assembly member 
in 1996.  Her father Huang Yung-chin served as a Provincial 
Assembly member for years until his death in 1998.  She 
inherited her father's constituency and was first elected as 
a Legislator in 1999. 
 
Huang is the first KMT member to hold the seat of Chiayi 
City Mayor after 20 years of independent rule by the Hsu 
family (Hsu-Chia-ben) and 3 years of DPP rule. 
 
¶3.  Chiayi County Magistrate - Chen Ming-wen (DPP) 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Born in 1954, Chen is the incumbent Chiayi County Magistrate 
elected in 2001. 
 
Chen holds a BA in Philosophy from Tung-hai University.  He 
was Taiwan Provincial Assembly member from 1985 to 1997, and 
was elected as a Legislator in 1998. 
 
Chen is the leader of Chiayi County's Lin faction, one of 
two local factions dominating Chiayi County and both 
affiliated with the KMT.  Chen was a KMT member until 2001. 
Before 2001, the Chiayi Magistrate's seat had been under the 
control of another faction (Huang faction, KMT) for 12 
years. To facilitate his chances of winning the magisterial 
seat, Chen joined the DPP and ran for the magistracy with 
the support of President Chen Shui-bian and defeated the KMT 
candidate in 2001. 
 
¶4.  Tainan City Mayor - Hsu Tain-tsair (DPP) 
-------------------------------------------- 
Born in 1950, Hsu is the incumbent Tainan City Mayor elected 
in 2001. 
 
Hsu has a master's degree in Economics from the Chinese 
Culture University, Taipei.  He studied in the doctoral 
program in Business Administration at Rutgers University in 
New Jersey.  He stayed in the U.S. for about ten years 
during the 1980's because he was "blacklisted" by Taiwan 
authorities for his pro-Taiwan independence views expressed 
when he was a student in the U.S. 
 
Hsu was first elected as a Legislator in 1992 and won re- 
election in 1995.  He ran unsuccessfully in the 1995 Tainan 
mayoral election against DPP candidate George Chang and 
later was expelled by the DPP, after which he became an 
independent.  Five years later, after Chang was widely 
criticized for mismanaging the City (and for corruption), 
President Chen endorsed Hsu in the 2001 Tainan mayoral 
election, pulling the rug out from under the DPP incumbent. 
Hsu easily won in that election. 
 
¶5.  Tainan County - Su Huan-chih (DPP) 
-------------------------------------- 
Born in 1955, Su is the incumbent Magistrate elected in 
¶2001. 
 
Su is a graduate of National Taiwan University Law School 
and has a master's degree in law from Fujen Catholic 
University.  He served as a Legislator from 1992 to 2001. 
He was President Chen's campaign assistant in the 1989 LY 
election and served as the First Lady's (Wu Shu-chen) 
assistant when she was a Legislator.  Su was devoted to 
environmental protection issues when he served as a 
Legislator. 
 
In the wake of this election, Su pointed out that the DPP 
Administration's first priority after the election is to 
promote cross-strait direct links, urging the advocates for 
Taiwan independence to put aside their ideological battle 
over the issue so that Taiwan's economy can continue to 
grow.
