"X-Ray Failure" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (1-11) notes: 
".....one of Obama's challenges is to reconcile the demands of war 
and civil rights.....The main problem still is to secure the U.S. 
as being 'one step ahead of the opponent.'  This advantage won't be 
reached with airport barriers....but on the information 
front......" 
 
 
 
"Principles that we used to love - and the practice" 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (1-9) by Clovis Rossi: "...in 
a world where leaders seldom take responsibility for any type of 
problem in their administration; [Obama's Thursday speech] was an 
incentive. ...Yes it was rhetoric, but it is always better than 
blaming [someone else]....another part of the speech is equally 
pleasing [where he talked about making sacrifices to freedom in the 
name of security]....It is a pity that reality is a lot 
different.....The open question is whether Obama will be able to 
harmonize the war against terrorism with the preservation of an 
open society."
