REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on application 050115687 for the export 
of night vision device (NVD) component parts to Algeria. 
Post is requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 
45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will 
affect pending and future licenses involving parties to this 
license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Lack of documentation from the 
end-user and unfamiliar foreign consignee, OCEA.  The company 
has appeared on previous license applications but the bona 
fides of the company have not been verified by a Blue Lantern 
check. 
 
¶4. ACTION ALGIERS: Embassy is requested to make inquiries 
with appropriate host government officials to confirm that 
the Algerian MoD has ordered and received the NVD component 
parts, and that the articles will be used for the purpose 
stated on the license.  Automated Export System (AES) 
indicates that items worth $24,424 were shipped from the U.S. 
on the following dates: 8 units ($8,548) on 09/21/08, 9 units 
($8,910) on 10/16/08, and 7 units ($6,930) on 10/26/08. 
 
¶5. ACTION PARIS: Department also requests that Embassy make 
appropriate inquiries to verify the bona fides of foreign 
consignee OCEA, and to confirm the legitimacy of this 
transaction.  PM/DTCC also requests that post conducts a site 
visit to the company in order to provide Department with an 
assessment of its business operations and on-site security. 
Finally, post is asked to assess whether the company appears 
to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  If a site visit is 
not possible, please inform the PM/DTCC officer (see para 7). 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have supporting documentation for this 
proposed transaction? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--Will OCEA retain positive control over the NVD component 
parts at all times? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
END ACTION
