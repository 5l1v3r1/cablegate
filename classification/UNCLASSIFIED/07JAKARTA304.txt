SUBJECT: SITREP ON FLOODING IN JAKARTA 
 
JAKARTA 00000304  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1. DCM chaired a meeting of the Emergency Action Committee 
(EAC) on February 5 to assess the flood situation in Jakarta 
and its implications for the Embassy.  Rain in the greater 
Jakarta area continued over the weekend, exacerbating 
flooding caused by heavy rains the latter part of last week. 
Local media report between 300,000 and 400,000 displaced from 
their homes and 20 fatalities.  There is no/no sense of 
political chaos or panic, and the public is taking this 
natural disaster in stride.  Measures to address the 
situation are being taken by the national government, but 
responsibility for the flooding will likely rest primarily 
with the local city government, which has been slow to 
complete a second canal through the city, begun after similar 
flooding in 2002.  Embassy remains operational, with full 
consular facilities.  The Ambassador declared a floor 
emergency and USAID contributed $100,000 in disaster relief 
for the city. 
 
TRANSPORTATION AND TRAVEL 
 
¶2. Transportation remains difficult, with some highways 
submerged or reduced to one or two viable lanes.  Commuter 
trains are out of service today, and bus lines are seriously 
affected, with only one of seven main lines in operation. 
Much of the city's local workforce, including the Embassy's, 
is unable to get to work. 
 
¶3. Travel to and from Jakarta's international airport has 
taken up to three hours in each direction (normal travel time 
is between 30 minutes and one hour), largely because of 
flooding on and around the toll road connecting the airport 
with the city center.  Hotel accommodations are becoming 
scarce. 
 
POWER AND UTILITIES 
 
¶4. Some American employees temporarily lost power over the 
weekend, and others have been without power at their 
residences since early this morning.  It appears that 
electrical power will not be restored today, and we are 
moving those affected into hotels on a temporary basis. 
There have been sporadic power and/or telephone outages in 
various parts of the city, and many areas of the city are 
without cable television and/or internet services. 
 
¶5. Only one Embassy work facility has been affected:  the GOI 
building housing our NAMRU-2 facility lost power over the 
weekend.  Electricity was reportedly restored to that 
building earlier today after some 48 hours without power; an 
emergency generator has kept essential medical supplies 
appropriately refrigerated.  Barring further interruptions, 
the facility is expected to resume normal operations tomorrow. 
 
ACCESS TO FACILITIES AND FSN RESIDENCES 
 
¶6. So far no/no Embassy residential units have experienced 
flooding, though some units are in areas surrounded by 
flooded streets.  The Embassy has staged vehicles at both the 
Chancery and the American Club compounds, and so far both 
compounds remain easily accessible.  We have work crews 
available and active in facilities, computer support, 
transportation, switchboard and other services. 
 
¶7. A number of our local staff is affected by flooding at 
their homes; we are working with our FSN association to 
determine how we can best assist those in need.  We will 
attempt to meet immediate needs through voluntary fundraising 
among American staff.  We will also be in touch with relevant 
Department authorities to tap into the FSN Relief Fund if 
appropriate. 
 
CRITICAL FACTOR:  THE FLOOD CANAL 
 
¶8. Jakarta has one main drainage canal to convey runoff water 
out of the city and to the sea.  It also carries water 
entering Jakarta from higher ground south of the city.  That 
canal cuts across the center of the city and had been at its 
limit for several days.  Over the weekend municipal 
authorities opened several of the sluice gates along the 
 
JAKARTA 00000304  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
canal to relieve excessive water levels further upstream. 
Surrounding streets are under water, although levels are 
being carefully monitored.  A surge of water through the 
canal could inundate central parts of the city, potentially 
affecting Indonesian national government and Embassy 
operations.  We are monitoring this situation closely with 
local authorities to anticipate any such developments.  To a 
large extent the performance of the canal depends on the 
amount of rainfall Jakarta and certain suburbs continue to 
receive. 
 
EMBASSY ACTIONS 
 
¶9. In addition to measures discussed above, Embassy is taking 
the following immediate actions to address the situation: 
 
-- A warden message has been released to the American 
Community advising of the situation in the city and Embassy 
operations and recommending against short-term travel to 
Jakarta at this time. 
 
-- Embassy has granted appropriate leave to U.S. and 
local-hire staff having family emergencies or unable to 
commute to work because of flooding.  Flex time is being used 
to allow employees to avoid rush-hour traffic. 
 
-- A security notice was sent to Embassy employees and 
families advising of common-sense practices relating to 
health and safety in connection with the flooding. 
 
-- Sections have been asked to review pending TDY travel to 
Jakarta and defer any non-essential travel until the weather 
stabilizes and the situation on the ground improves. 
 
SITUATION AT OTHER MISSION POSTS 
 
¶10. As of noon today local time, our consulates in Surabaya, 
Medan and our consular agent in Bali reported good weather, 
with no forecasts of excessive rain in the near future.
