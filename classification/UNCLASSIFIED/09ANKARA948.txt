In Today's Papers 
 
Confidence Building Package from the Government 
Mainstream Sabah reports that the government is preparing a 
confidence-building package to reduce the tension regarding the 
military at the recent meeting of the National Security Council. 
The package contains the message, "we are not prejudiced against the 
military," and will establish a committee comprised of jurists of 
the National Defense and Justice Ministries to examine the amendment 
passed by parliament that would allow for military personnel to be 
tried by civilian courts.  In addition, it will be explained to the 
military that the amendments to the Turkish Penal Code (TCK) are one 
result of Turkey's EU accession process. The military will also be 
told that the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) demanded the 
amendments and finally, the trial of high-ranked military officers 
will be possible only with the permission of the president. 
 
In a related story, liberal Radikal reports that President Gul said 
"the jurists of the Defense and Justice Ministries and the Turkish 
Armed Forces should prepare a report regarding the legislation. 
Radikal speculates that this is a signal that the legislation "might 
be amended" and this can be done either by "a veto" or an alternate 
legal arrangement.  Meanwhile, mainstream Milliyet reports that the 
politicians reacted differently to the NSC statement the other day. 
Main opposition party CHP spokesperson Mustafa Ozyurek said "the 
statement is not satisfactory", opposition party MHP deputy Oktay 
Vural said "the statement shows us that the Prime Minister was 
warned at the meeting", and finally, AKP deputy Bekir Bozdag said 
"it is a positive statement, and mutual sensitivities were 
highlighted." 
 
Editorial Commentary on the Civilian-Military Relations 
 
Cuneyt Ulsever wrote in mainstream Hurriyet: "While the AKP was 
trying to change the current structure in order to establish 
civilian court supremacy over military courts, the country's prime 
minister was depicting policemen as "insurance to the regime."  This 
is absolutely an expression of autocracy and has nothing to do with 
the rule of law or democracy.  Turkey's internal and external issues 
require the AKP government to be in close cooperation and be in 
harmony with military.  Thus the AKP is standing before a crossroads 
where it has to make a choice.  Turkey's internal dynamics as well 
as U.S. expectations call for harmony and coordination with the 
military." 
 
Ali Bayramoglu wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "It is hard to 
understand why president Gul has been facing criticism from some 
circles and has been put under pressure to veto legislation which 
paves the way for trial of military in civilian courts.  This 
(reform) is about Turkey's path to democracy." 
 
Murat Yetkin wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal: "This hastily 
passed legislation does no good for civilian-military ties.  If the 
genuine intention is to have military personnel tried by civilian 
courts, the existing laws are already providing it.  The arrest of 
Navy Colonel Cicek with charges related to Ergenekon case by a 
civilian court is a good example.  In fact president Gul has 
signaled that he is going to veto the pending legislation because it 
is not compatible with the constitution." 
 
Colonel Cicek Released After Brief Detention 
All papers and TV channels report that Colonel Cicek, who was 
arrested by a court in Istanbul under the Ergenekon probe, was 
released late on Wednesday after twenty hours of detention, notes 
mainstream Hurriyet.  Cicek's lawyers appealed to the court's arrest 
order earlier Wednesday.  Colonel Cicek was alleged to be involved 
in an alleged anti-government plot document. 
 
DTP Leader Ahmet Turk on Kurdish Issue 
Mainstream Milliyet reports that DTP leader Ahmet Turk told DTP 
supporters in Batman, "There will be no solution to the Kurdish 
 
ANKARA 00000948  002 OF 003 
 
 
problem unless Kurdish people, their leader and Kurdish politics are 
all taken into consideration." 
 
CENTCOM Commander Petraeus Visits Ankara 
Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu and TGS Chief Ilker Basbug met 
Wednesday with chief commander of the U.S. Central Command General 
David Petraeus in Ankara.  According to media, they discussed issues 
such as security and military cooperation between Turkey and the 
U.S., foreign policy matters, routes for the U.S. withdrawal from 
Iraq, NATO operations in Afghanistan, and the situation in Pakistan. 
  Liberal Radikal reports in "Petraeus Wants The Biggest Support for 
Afghanistan," that "Petraeus noted Turkey is a strong and powerful 
ally," and answered a question regarding the U.S. withdrawal from 
Iraq by saying, "our logistics cooperation continues to pass 
supplies through the Habur Gate and other routes."  In "General 
Petraeus Met with Davutoglu," leftist Taraf reports, "Petraeus met 
with the foreign minister in order to update him on the U.S. 
withdrawal plans from Iraq, but he did not request anything from 
Ankara regarding this withdrawal."  In "A U.S. General's Critical 
Ankara Summit," mainstream Milliyet writes, "no official request was 
made of Turkey regarding the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq." 
 
U.S. Launches Major Operations Against the Taliban in Afghanistan 
Mainstream NTV reports, "Obama Strikes the Taliban," as "Obama 
signaled he would step up the war in Afghanistan during his 
elections campaign," and with the start of the latest operations, 
"he has begun the broadest and most comprehensive operations there 
yet."  CNN Turk headlines, "The First Major Attack," and notes, "The 
first major attack against the Taliban in Afghanistan since 
President Barack Obama came to power has begun in the Helmand 
Province."  Mainstream Hurriyet's website reports, "Obama Makes His 
First Major Attack." 
 
Ahmadinejad Lashes Out at The West Amid Increasing Domestic 
Pressure 
Media continue to report on Iran's political crisis.  NTV reports, 
"Moussavi strongly criticizes Ahmadinejad," while  CNN Turk 
headlines, "According to Moussavi, The Government Is Not 
Legitimate," and the story notes, "Moussavi made a call on the 
government to release the children of the revolution." Leftist Taraf 
headlines, "Kerrubi and Moussavi: We Will Not Recognize 
Ahmadinejad's Government."    However, Islamist-oriented Zaman 
reports, "Moussavi is found guilty by the Besij," of "damaging 
national security," and "crimes against the state." In addition, the 
paper notes in, "A Hard Line from Hatemi," that "Former president 
and reformist leader Mohammed Hatemi has charged the government with 
making a revolution against the people."  Meanwhile, mainstream 
Sabah reports in "The Iranian Leader Calls for Revenge," that 
"Ahmadinejad has called for revenge against the countries (he says) 
are behind the demonstrations," in what Sabah calls, "a hard-lined 
message to Western nations."
