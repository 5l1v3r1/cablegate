In Today's Papers 
 
Headscarf Debate Continuous 
All papers continue giving extensive front-page coverage to the 
ongoing 'turban debate' in Turkey, with secularist circles opposing 
the ruling AKP-MHP sponsored effort to lift the headscarf ban in 
universities through a constitutional amendment.  Liberal Radikal 
says Turkey is divided into two as the parliament prepares to 
discuss a lift of the ban with  trade unions and NGOs divided on the 
reform.  Parliament is set to debate the amendment this week.  The 
ban would remain for teachers and civil servants.  Members of 
Turkey's judiciary and leading businessmen have already criticized 
the AKP-MHP's move.  The main opposition CHP has said it would try 
to block the reform through the Constitutional Court.  The Turkish 
military has made clear it is closely watching the debates, but has 
so far refrained from directly commenting on the headscarf proposal. 
 
 
On Saturday, more than 120,000 Turks held rallies in the capital 
Ankara and 17 other cities across Turkey against the headscarf 
reform, which they say would open the way for a radical form of 
Islam in Turkey.  Women's organizations will reportedly stage new 
rallies on February 9. 
 
Prime Minister Erdogan told a gathering in Istanbul late Saturday 
that those who claim Turkey will become a religious state were 
actually the ones dividing society by blaming everybody who thinks 
or dresses differently for being an enemy of secularism. 
Papers report retired high justice Sabih Kanadoglu, the Court of 
Appeals' honorary chief prosecutor, said the headscarf ban cannot be 
removed because it would be against the basic tenets of the 
constitution. 
 
Meanwhile, papers report Joost Lagendijk, co-chairman of Turkey-EU 
joint parliamentary commission, told a 'Turkey-EU' conference in the 
Netherlands, "Parties should work out a compromise and accept that 
university students are grown-ups capable of making their own 
decisions." 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turban Freedom in Universities 
Semih Idiz observed in mainstream Milliyet (2/4):  "At a recent 
press conference, FM Ali Babacan said that turban freedom in the 
universities is a requirement in the democratic EU reforms. 
However, passing the ball to the EU on the turban issue was not 
received positively by EU circles.  Diplomatic circles I met with 
during the weekend reiterated that the EU doesn't have an official 
position on the turban issue.  They did not find Babacan's efforts 
to try and fit the turban issue into a "general freedoms" framework 
for obvious reasons: if the issue is implementing the "Copenhagen 
Criteria" for freedoms, then Ankara has many other things to do 
urgently.  For example, Brussels is always  pressuring Turkey to 
amend Article 301 and eliminate the punishment of thought.  But 
there have been no positive developments on this issue since the 
2007 elections.  While the government is not exerting any efforts to 
eliminate obstacles to freedom of thought, FM Babacan's efforts to 
fit turban freedom into the EU reforms' framework was greeted by 
skepticism from the EU.  Turkey has a long list on its hands - from 
Article 301 to women's rights and minority rights - to correct in 
order to bring 'first class democracy' to the country.  Therefore, 
Babacan's comments are nothing but sheer demagogy.  Never mind the 
EU, he can't even convince anyone in Turkey." 
 
Mehmet Yilmaz commented in mainstream Hurriyet (2/4):  "The photos 
of the AKP-MHP's turban freedom initiative and the rallies in Ankara 
and in the other provinces over the weekend to protest the lifting 
of the turban ban in universities might have caused fear among the 
public.  But I don't think there is any need for fear because all 
these pictures show is that Turks are waking up and realizing that 
it's not a bad thing to protest against wrong political initiatives. 
 The Turkish public, eventually, has managed to get rid of its 
 
ANKARA 00000196  002 OF 003 
 
 
hesitance to use democratic rights.  I believe that this democratic 
consciousness is the most important guarantee for those concerned 
about the future of the secular-democratic republic as well as for 
others who are scared of being forced to open their minds.  However, 
if civic sensitivity can be demonstrated in such a fashion in 
Turkey, then nobody should be afraid of a military coup or a change 
of regime.  The latest developments prove that the secular and 
democratic republic is rooted deeply in Turkey." 
 
10 PKK Terrorists Killed in Bingol 
Sabah, Hurriyet, Milliyet and others:  The Turkish General Staff 
announced on its web site on Sunday that 10 PKK terrorists were 
killed in rural parts of Ortacanak village in Bingol province.  They 
were killed after they opened fire on security forces warning them 
not to fire.  Turkish troops seized ammunition, illegal documents 
and other materials in the terrorists' hideouts. 
 
Turkish Journalists in Kandil Mountains 
Mainstream "Sabah" writes that journalisst/writers Ahmet Altan and 
Yasemin Congar went to Kandil mountain in northern Iraq to talk to 
PKK leaders.  Altan reported that PKKers are expecting a land 
operation in spring and have faced difficulties since Talabani's 
forces surrounded Kandil and made access more difficult.  They also 
said that they are living in tents in fields as a result of Turkish 
air operations. 
 
Babacan: 2008 Will be Year of EU Reforms in Turkey 
Foreign Minister Ali Babacan told a news conference Saturday the 
ruling AKP government would surprise everyone with its EU-oriented 
reforms in 2008.  Babacan said Turkey has a new president, 
parliament and government, and its infrastructure is ready for a 
wave of reform.  Babacan noted that the law on non-Muslim minority 
foundations was ready, and that there were moves to amend Article 
301 of the penal code.  On Friday, the Turkish Parliament approved a 
bill that will permit minority foundations to acquire property, 
receive donations and seek compensations for their properties sold 
to third persons.  Turkey's government wants to expand freedoms to 
turn Turkey into a "first-class democracy where freedoms in all 
fields are enjoyed fully", Babacan emphasized. 
Babacan said the heated debates over the headscarf issue and rising 
tensions taint Turkey's image.  Babacan also noted foreign 
investments in Turkey in 2006 and 2007 stood at over USD 20 billion.
