SUBJECT: ECUADOR TO SUPPORT CUBAN UNGA RESOLUTION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 215870 
 
¶1.  (U) In response to Reftel, the Embassy October 7 
delivered pro-embargo, anti-resolution talking points to the 
Ecuadorian foreign ministry.  In a follow-up meeting October 
14 with MFA Director General for Multilateral Policy Miguel 
Mendes, Poloff emphasized three points:  the U.S. embargo was 
a bilateral matter not relevant for multilateral discussion, 
it was but one tool the USG was utilizing to foment 
democratic opposition and a peaceful transition in Cuba, and 
the international community should focus instead on Castro's 
documented human rights abuses. 
 
¶2.  (U) Mendes claimed to have visited Cuba recently and 
there saw great suffering.  Not only Castro's lackeys, but 
the rank-and-file too, blamed the embargo for their 
deplorable living standards.  Mendes erroneously believed the 
U.S. measure prevented foreign-based multinational 
corporations from doing business in Cuba, and called for its 
lifting on humanitarian grounds.  The GoE deplored Castro's 
imprisonment of dissidents and other draconian policies, 
however, and would continue to push for glasnost on the 
island. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Pressed, Mendes admitted Ecuador would 
follow its long-standing policy of supporting Cuba's 
anti-embargo UNGA vote.  His professed concern over GoC human 
rights abuses was disingenuous, unfortunately, as Castro 
remains a beloved figure in Ecuador, especially amongst its 
left-leaning diplomats.
