SUBJECT: COLUMNIST IN PRO-CHAVEZ DAILY CALLS RESIGNATION OF 
OAS SECRETARY GENERAL A U.S. COUP 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. The regular "Stumbling Block" column published under the 
pseudonym "Marciano" in the very pro-Chavez daily DIARIO 
VEA, bitterly attacked the resignation of Costa Rican 
Secretary General Miguel Angel Rodriguez.  It described this 
 
SIPDIS 
as a U.S. coup to maintain control of the OAS.  The 
Salvadoran OAS Secretary General candidate and any Peruvian 
candidate are seen as U.S. puppets.  It is widely believed 
in Venezuela that "Marciano" is actually Venezuela's Vice- 
President, Jose Vincente Rangel.  END SUMMARY.

HEADLINE AND FULL TEXT

¶2. DIARIO VEA (pro-government, circ. 25,000) 
10/13 Stumbling Block column headline: "Coup at the OAS" 
 
Quotes: "A coup was mounted against Miguel Angel Rodriguez 
at the OAS.  Why does this columnist say that?  Because 
everything is very clear.  The U.S. did not like Rodriguez. 
The reasons were not that clear.  When Cesar Gaviria's 
succession was discussed, the possible options were: the 
Chilean Insulza, Lagos' candidate, and the Salvadoran 
Flores, Washington's favorite candidate.  Rodriguez did not 
stand out; he was only mentioned symbolically.  What 
happened?  Chavez involved himself in the process.  He 
regarded Rodriguez as a good candidate to beat Flores 
"...the U.S. maneuvered but could not prevent the formation 
of a Caribbean and Latin American bloc in support of 
Rodriguez.  Washington had no choice but to accept and said 
to itself: 'I'll get back at you later on!' 
"... The coup had been consummated.  The U.S. has recovered, 
for the moment, control of the OAS through the gringo (sic) 
sub-secretary Einaudi, and the possibility of proposing 
captive candidates, such as the Salvadoran Flores or any 
Peruvian candidate that might be in line.  This story is not 
over..."

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5. The GoV and the more leftist Chavistas view the OAS with 
suspicion; the GoV had welcomed the election of Rodriguez as 
it perceived he would be a far less interventionist OAS 
Secretary General.  In addition, the Salvadoran OAS 
 
SIPDIS 
Secretary General candidate, Flores, had provoked GoV ire by 
 
SIPDIS 
his early recognition of the April 2002, short-lived Carmona 
presidency.  The charge that the USG is behind Rodriguez's 
departure has little resonance here; its appearance in VEA 
reflects both an instinctive suspicion of the USG as well as 
bald-faced manipulation. End Comment.
