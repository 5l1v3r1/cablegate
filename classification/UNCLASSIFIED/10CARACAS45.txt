REF: 09 STATE 122732 
 
¶1.  (U) This cable contains Post's proposals for biotech outreach 
in response to State 122732. 
 
¶2.  (U) Though the GBRV has not granted approval for biotechnology 
crops, there is significant interest and research from government 
institutions and universities on its development.  Despite the 
government's reluctance towards biotechnology, Venezuelan producers 
continue to express their need and acceptance of biotech products. 
Venezuela presents an opportunity to further encourage agricultural 
biotechnology to address food security and increased production. 
By uniting different participants in the industry, there is an 
opportunity to further their cooperation as well as the use of 
biotechnology. 
 
¶3.  (U) Collaborating with the United States Department of 
Agriculture, Post recommends the following proposals aimed at 
tackling obstacles to biotechnology propagation in Venezuela.  They 
are ranked in order of viability and importance. 
 
¶4.  (U) Proposal 1 - Sponsor a conference in support of REDBIO: 
This event would help rejuvenate the international organization 
REDBIO's activities in Venezuela by bringing together national and 
U.S. biotech specialists, interested parties, university students 
and press.  Focusing on topics that promote biotechnology, it would 
create synergy in Caracas that currently is not present and serve 
as a multiplier to REDBIO's regional efforts.  (Estimated cost: 
$40,000; Expected execution: Spring/Summer 2010) 
 
¶5.  (U) Proposal 2 - DVC seminar:  Using the PAS section's DVC 
capabilities, Post would foster biotechnology education among 
university students and other interested parties, who lack access 
to these resources. In conjunction with a local university, 
participants could attend bi-weekly seminars at the Embassy to 
interact with U.S. and Venezuelan experts on biotechnology.  This 
would help prospective agronomists to understand the benefits of 
biotechnology and its applicability in Venezuela.  The programs 
could also foster contact between Venezuelan and U.S. scientific 
and education communities. (Estimated cost:  $10,000; Expected 
execution: Summer 2010) 
 
¶6.  (U) Post appreciates the Department's consideration of these 
proposals.
