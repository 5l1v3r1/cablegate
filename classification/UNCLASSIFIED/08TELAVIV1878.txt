SUBJECT: ISRAEL MEDIA REACTION 
 
-------------------------------- 
SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT: 
-------------------------------- 
 
Mideast 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The media reported that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will 
arrive in the country today and meet with Israel's principal 
ministers and PA President Mahmoud Abbas.  Yesterday the Jerusalem 
Post reported that FM Tzipi Livni will urge the Secretary to 
jettison plans for a joint Israeli-Palestinian document to be 
presented at the UN General Assembly. 
 
Over the weekend the media reported that Sen. Barack Obama chose 
Sen. Joseph Biden as his running mate.  Although most media 
characterized Biden as "pro-Israel," Israel Hayom noted that this 
has not always been the case.  Ha'aretz features an article on key 
Jewish movers and shakers at the Democratic National Convention. 
The Jerusalem Post reported that Denver Jews told the newspaper that 
Colorado is a battleground state. 
 
Electronic media reported that last night the cabinet approved the 
2009 budget, 13 to 12.  Labor and Shas ministers, as well as 
Kadima's Shaul Mofaz, voted against the budget.  Kadima Minister 
Haim Ramon abstained. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that the head of the Palestinian negotiating team, 
Ahmed Qurei, toured in recent weeks with senior Israeli officials 
the area near Ariel and other settlements whose future is disputed. 
Political sources in Jerusalem were quoted assaying that the tour of 
these areas was meant to highlight the complexity  for Israel in 
talks on matters of borders and territory.  The same sources were 
quoted as saying that Qurei did not enter the settlements, and only 
viewed them from a distance. Qurei's counterpart in the talks, FM 
Tzipi Livni, did not participate in the tour. 
 
The media reported over the weekend that in order to avoid a public 
relations debacle, Israel did not respond to the arrival of two 
boats bearing left-wing activists on their way to Gaza.  Ha'aretz 
reported that Israel is not currently planning to stop or inspect 
the boats when they leave Gaza, because there is no intelligence 
indicating that the activists plan to smuggle wanted terrorists out 
of the Strip.  The activists apparently plan to smuggle out two 
students who received Fulbright scholarships in the U.S., but were 
denied U.S. visas on security grounds (according to the newspaper). 
The defense establishment's current thinking is that a clash over 
this issue would simply play into the activists' hands by generating 
media attention. 
 
Yesterday Ha'aretz reported that the U.S. will make use of missile 
radars in armored trailers in Europe as shields against Iran. 
 
The electronic media reported that this morning Israel released 198 
Palestinian prisoners in the West Bank, as a gesture of good will to 
President Abbas.  Abbas was quoted as saying that there will be no 
peace until Israel releases all Palestinian prisoners. 
 
Yesterday Maariv reported that Defense Minister Ehud Barak will fly 
to Egypt on Tuesday in order to meet in Alexandria with Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian Intelligence head Omar Suleiman, 
and Egyptian Defense Minister Hussein Tantawi.  The officials will 
discuss negotiations for the return of Gilad Shalit. 
 
Citing Reuters, Ha'aretz quoted a senior Hizbullah official as 
saying yesterday that Israel will be targeted by thousands of 
rockets if it attacks Iran.  The media quoted Hizbullah 
Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah as saying yesterday that his 
organization will respond "decisively" to any Israeli aggression. 
Yesterday Ha'aretz reported that the defense establishment 
recommended last week that Israel support extending the mandate of 
the international force deployed in southern Lebanon. 
 
Yesterday Ha'aretz cited Syria's denial on Friday that it was 
considering hosting an advanced Russian missile system, a day after 
President Bashar Assad held talks with Russian officials about 
upgrading his country's military.  Yesterday The Jerusalem Post 
quoted a senior Israeli defense official as saying on Saturday as 
saying that Syria is trying to press the U.S. to sponsor talks with 
Israel. 
 
Yesterday Ha'aretz reported that Israel's leading ultra-Orthodox 
rabbis are waging a new campaign to prevent Jews visiting 
Jerusalem's Temple Mount. 
 
Ha'aretz and The Jerusalem Post reported that yesterday police and 
security personnel closed down an office in the northern town of Umm 
al-Fahm reputedly affiliated with the Islamic Movement and linked to 
Islamic organizations abroad.  The closure order, drafted by Defense 
Minister Ehud Barak, described the organization operating there as 
an "unrecognized association."  Police in the Jezreel Valley 
District were quoted as saying yesterday that they suspect the 
Al-Aqsa Institute, founded in 2000 by movement leader Sheikh Raed 
Salah, of having been operating from the location.  The Defense 
Ministry also issued instructions to freeze the organization's bank 
accounts.  Police sources were quoted a saying that the group was 
operating in cooperation with the Hamas leadership in Jerusalem. 
Its activity was allegedly funded in part by the "Charity 
Coalition," an umbrella group of hard-line Islamic foundations from 
around the world.  Police also said that the coalition transferred 
large sums of money to Hamas and Al-Aqsa without proper 
documentation, through money changers, laundering, and bank 
transfers. 
 
Leading media reported that security prisoners have complained that 
their prison wardens have unleashed dogs on them. 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted Israeli officials as saying yesterday that 
Israel had not officially made a decision regarding the planned 
Mideast conference in Moscow.  The officials stressed, however, that 
Jerusalem was continuing to send messages to the Kremlin that it did 
not want the crisis in Georgia to damage Israeli-Russian ties.  The 
officials were quoted as saying that the Moscow conference would not 
only be raised during Rice's visit but also at a meeting of the 
Quartet in mid-September on the sidelines of the UN General 
Assembly.  The Jerusalem Post reported that Likud Chairman Benjamin 
Netanyahu is scheduled to visit Moscow on September 11. 
 
Yediot reported that an Iraqi court has sentenced to death the 
assassin of the sons of senior Iraqi official Mithal Al-Aloussi, who 
visited Israel in 2004. 
 
All media reported that law enforcement authorities in the U.S. have 
requested the extradition of Yitzhak Abergil, who is believed to 
stand at the head of one of the largest crime families in Israel. 
American authorities have also asked for the extradition of four 
other persons (including Abergil's brother Meir) who are alleged to 
be members of the same underworld organization.  Yitzhak Abergil is 
suspected of involvement in the 2003 murder of a drug dealer in the 
U.S., as well as of money-laundering and extortion.  The five were 
indicted in the U.S. on July 23; the request for their extradition 
was sent to Israel last Friday.

Summary:

Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz: "Wounded and eager for some sort of positive 
legacy, Rice will arrive today on another frustrating mission in 
Jerusalem and Ramallah." 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar commented in Ha'aretz: "It is high 
time for Olmert and those who wish to succeed him to inform [settler 
leaders] that the rules of the game have changed." 
 
Conservative Op-Ed Page Editor Ben-Dror Yemini wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv: "This is the strangest closure in the history of 
conflicts.  The Israeli side wants the border crossings open; Hamas 
carries out terror attacks so as to make sure the border crossings 
are closed.  But that is of no interest to the peace saboteurs." 
 
The nationalist, Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe editorialized: "The 
Left has started a new line of propaganda as a true ally of Hamas." 
 
 
Block Quotes: 
------------- 
 
Â¶I.  "A Last-Ditch Attempt" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (8/25): "Before bridging the differences 
between Israelis and Palestinians, Rice will have to pave the way 
between the contradictory viewpoints of her hosts in Jerusalem. 
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert believes that it is possible and 
necessary to reach a 'shelf agreement' now.... Olmert faces 
opposition from both Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign 
Minister Tzipi Livni.  In their view, Israel must not rush.  Livni 
believes that detailed negotiations must continue on all issues, and 
that Israel should avoid an unclear agreement.  She also supports 
deferring resolution of the Jerusalem quagmire.  Barak has warned 
against dangerous illusions, at a time when the gap between the two 
sides remains substantial..... On one issue, all three agree: They 
reject the idea put forth by Rice, to publish a document of partial 
agreements detailing the positions of each side on different issues. 
 In their view, such a document would only harm Israel and would 
serve as a basis for pressure in the future.  Following a meeting in 
Washington with Rice and Abbas in late July, Livni is of the opinion 
that the idea will be dropped.  However, Rice is keen on showing 
gains, especially in light of the growing criticism directed against 
her in the United States.... Thus, wounded and eager for some sort 
of positive legacy, Rice will arrive today on another frustrating 
mission in Jerusalem and Ramallah." 
 
II.  "Let Them Stay in Palestine" 
 
Senior op-ed writer Akiva Eldar commented in Ha'aretz (8/25): "[The 
question Kadima voters must ask themselves on the way to the polls 
is] which candidate is capable of instructing the chief of staff, at 
3 P.M., to evacuate 110 settlements in the West Bank.  After all, 
this was Kadima's major promise to its voters.... It is high time 
for Olmert and those who wish to succeed him to inform [settler 
leaders] that the rules of the game have changed.  State lands in 
the territories have never been, de jure, sovereign property of the 
State of Israel. From now on, they are part of the state of 
Palestine, and for every dunam of land that is annexed in the West 
Bank, we will compensate with land from Israel proper.... Yasser 
Arafat at one point agreed to grant Jewish settlers Palestinian 
citizenship, in addition to Israeli citizenship, and to provide them 
with full rights, including a fair apportionment of water and land 
resources. We only need to make sure that the Jewish minority in 
Palestine receives the same treatment accorded to the Arab minority 
in Israel. No more, no less. Or perhaps that would be too cruel." 
 
III.  "Peace Saboteurs" 
 
Conservative Op-Ed Page Editor Ben-Dror Yemini wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv (8/24): "This time, for a change, the top tiers of 
the Israeli leadership made a correct decision.  The supporters of 
Hamas's horrific regime wanted to show the world a clash.  They 
wanted pictures of Israeli war ships  facing off against what they 
described in their Orwellian terminology as 'peace ships,' or IDF 
soldiers against 'human rights activists.'  They didn't get what 
they were looking for.  There was no clash.  The major networks 
around the world ignored them.  The low profile, on the verge of 
ignoring them, paid off.  Their purpose was to 'break the siege.' 
Siege?  Dozens of trucks in Israel cross every day and provide the 
residents of the Gaza Strip with their every need.  There is no lack 
of money in the Gaza Strip.  Iran has sent in hundreds of 
millions.... In very simple words, this is the strangest closure in 
the history of conflicts.  The Israeli side wants the border 
crossings open; Hamas carries out terror attacks so as to make sure 
the border crossings are closed.  But that is of no interest to the 
 
peace saboteurs.  Those war activists spoke at length about a 
'humanitarian crisis.'  That too is a joke.... Some of the media 
around the world and in Israel referred to them as 'peace 
activists.'  But who are they really?  One of the central figures 
who raised funds for this campaign was Riad Hammad, an Arab-American 
who declared his desire to see Israel destroyed and to have the Jews 
deported en masse.  He was questioned a number of times by the FBI 
and committed suicide a number of months ago....  One of the 
supporters is Claire Short, a former British cabinet minister, who 
blamed Israel for global warming.  And, like always, every time 
there is a false show of peace, there are always Israelis who are 
willing to join.  That was the case this time as well.  There is no 
point discussing them. This time the supporters of the terrorist 
regime met with failure.  But we oughtn't be dismissive of them. 
Usually, their industry of lies wins.  They lost a battle.  But the 
war is still far from being over." 
 
 
 
 
IV.  "Ship of Fools" 
 
The nationalist, Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe editorialized (8/25): 
"The Left has started a new line of propaganda as a true ally of 
Hamas.  It is good that Israeli and world public opinion see this 
picture.  The moral flaw of the Left has been exposed: left-wing 
activists are celebrating with a happening that is all 
entertainment, at the expense of the blood spilled in the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.... The image of the cruise and the 
fools adds up to that of the permanent political rioting at the 
construction of the fence at Na'alin.... Israel will have no choice 
at some point but to confront the old-new enemy -- first by curbing 
the riots in Na'alin, then by arresting the activists of the 
organizations encouraging violence."
