Kuznestov delivered the demarche (reftel) to MOFA's 
International Nuclear Energy Cooperation officials, Zentaro 
Naganuma, Principal Deputy Director and Toshio Kaneko, Chief 
Nuclear Security Officer. Naganuma said reaching a consensus 
on proposed activities by all of the relevant Japanese

meet the December 18 deadline. Regarding the proposal, MOFA 
requested Washington's guidance on appropriate activities.
