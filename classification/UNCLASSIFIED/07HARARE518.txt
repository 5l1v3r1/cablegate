REF: A. HARARE 503 
 
     ¶B. 06 HARARE 01433 
 
--------------------------------- 
'Silent March' Arrestees Released 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (U) All seven Women of Zimbabwe Arise! (WOZA) activists 
arrested in Bulawayo on June 6 (Ref A) have been released. 
On June 8 police released without charge the five WOZA 
members initially arrested at the demonstration, and released 
WOZA leaders Jenni Williams and Magodonga Mahlangu on June 10 
after charging the two leaders with violating public order 
sections of the Criminal Code.  The two women posted 
Z$100,000 bail (about US$1.50 at the parallel market exchange 
rate) and are due back in court on June 18. 
 
¶2. (U) Neither Williams nor Mahlangu was injured while in 
custody; however, they told us that conditions at the jail 
were deplorable.  Several of the other arrestees were not so 
fortunate and required medical attention upon their release, 
mostly for severe bruising from baton wielding police at the 
time of arrest. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
WOZA Keeps Up the Pressure and Claims Victory 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) With Williams and Mahlangu fresh out of jail, WOZA 
kept up the pressure.  On June 11 more than 150 WOZA 
supporters gathered in the rural town of Filabusi, located 
about 1.5 hours from Bulawayo in Matabeleland South Province, 
for a local launch of the group's "People's Charter" campaign 
for social justice (Ref B.).  Williams told us, however, that 
the police must have had advanced warning because they 
arrived at the staging area before the demonstration began 
and arrested two WOZA activists. 
 
¶4. (U) As was the case in Bulawayo on June 6, the WOZA 
members not arrested marched to the police station and 
demanded to be arrested in a show of solidarity.  This time, 
however, the police allowed them into the station and called 
in the ruling party ZANU-PF district administrator to meet 
with the women and listen to their complaints.  Initial 
reports from WOZA indicated that police had arrested the 
group.  When contacted later by lawyers representing the WOZA 
members, the police claimed that they had only met with the 
women and never made any arrests. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Williams told us that WOZA was pleased with the 
district administrator's attempt to engage the group.  She 
was also encouraged that the police kept copies of the 
"People's Charter" to pass on to provincial leaders. 
Williams added that in contrast to the brutal treatment they 
had just received in Bulawayo, WOZA members considered the 
event in Filabusi a significant victory and a reaffirmation 
of their peaceful resistance approach.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) WOZA continues to be one of Zimbabwe's most active 
and successful civil society groups.  Despite police getting 
 
HARARE 00000518  002 OF 002 
 
 
the drop on the Filabusi demonstration, WOZA's strategy of a 
series of quick strike actions of one to two hundred 
supporters in various parts of the country keeps the 
government guessing where they might pop up next. 
Additionally, their consistent focus on bread and butter 
issues -- school fees, food security, jobs -- resonates well 
in both urban and rural areas.  End Comment.
