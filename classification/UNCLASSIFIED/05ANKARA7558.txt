BRIEFING 
 
Investigation Against Baykal, Tezic, and Koc:  All papers 
covered extensively the investigation initiated by Ankara 
Chief State Prosecutor into comments made about the trial of 
Van University Rector Yucel Askin.  Earlier, PM Erdogan had 
accused CHP leader Baykal, Chairman of the Higher Education 
Board Tezic and business leader Mustafa Koc, of committing a 
constitutional crime by taking sides and commenting on the 
ongoing trial.  "Aksam" reports that the prosecutor could 
demand up to eight and half years in prison for those under 
investigation according articles 277 and 288 of the 
constitution.  "Sabah" says Baykal is protected by 
parliamentary immunity against trials and Tezic, as the head 
of the Higher Education Board, also benefits from partial 
immunity before the law.  The investigation initiated by the 
prosecutor shocked the business world, adds the paper. 
 
The Victims of Freedom of Expression Laws (aka Article 301): 
Several papers, including "Radikal," "Yeni Safak" and 
"Zaman" fronted that writers of books and articles might all 
be subject to imprisonment as writer Zulkuf Kisanak and 
journalist Aziz Ozer were found guilty by the court for 
violating Article 301 of the penal code by insulting the 
republic or the government.  "Radikal" stresses that the 
courts continue convicting people for their publications 
despite the recent statement of FM Gul that nobody has been 
given a prison sentence in Turkey for expressing his/her 
thoughts. 
 
ECHR Ruling on Property Rights:  The European Court of Human 
Rights ruled on Thursday in the case of Greek Cypriot 
Xenides Arestis.  Portraying the decision as a victory for 
 
ANKARA 00007558  002 OF 002 
 
 
Turkey, press reported that the court ruled that Turkey had 
violated property rights but there was no need for any 
compensation payment for the time being.  "Cumhuriyet" notes 
that this ruling showed that the ECHR was inclined to ask 
the Greek Cypriots to apply to the Turkish Cypriot 
Commission with future complaints. 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION:  Afghanistan; Middle East 
 
"A Different Vision of Kabul" 
Sami Kohen commented in the mainstream daily "Milliyet" 
(12/23):  "With a new constitution in place, Afghanistan has 
entered into a political structuring process, with a new 
parliament as well as a president elected by the people.  Is 
this going to give new hope to the 30 million Afghanis after 
32 years of blood and tears under Soviet occupation and 
Taliban rule?  Can this new process provide hope for unity, 
security and better lives for Afghanistan?  Such questions 
can easily be asked about Iraq as well.  However, a close 
look reveals some differences between the two situations. 
Afghanistan does not suffer from ethic and religious 
conflict.  The new Afghan parliament has proportional 
representation of the population from different ethnic 
backgrounds.  President Karzai is a strong figure in the 
country and is popular.  Afghanistan, even with different 
ethic groups, does not have any separatist movement. 
Moreover, unlike in Iraq, there is no anti-Americanism in 
Afghanistan.  The US military presence came with UN approval 
and NATO's contribution. Afghanis now are in need of social 
and economic support along with peace and security. An 
upcoming meeting in London will try to address these issues 
and prepare a `road-map' for Afghanistan for the next 5 
years.  Afghanistan has presented a very good example in the 
political field and it remains to be seen if the success 
will carry over into other areas." 
 
"Bush and Sharon Style Democracy" 
Husnu Mahalli argued in the mass appeal "Aksam" (12/23): 
"The last leg of Palestinian local elections was held and 
radical-Islamist Hammas won a significant victory despite 
all kinds of threats coming from the US, Israel and the 
European Union.  This result, even though the elections were 
held under occupation conditions, is very important and 
hints at the result of parliamentary elections scheduled for 
January 25.  According to opinion polls, Hammas is the 
favorite in the parliamentary elections as well.  There is a 
strong possibility of a coalition government between 
Arafat's Al Fatah and Hammas.  Interestingly, enough both 
Bush and Sharon started saying that they will not let this 
happen.  In other words, President Bush, who promotes 
democracy with his Greater Middle East initiative, is now 
standing against a government with popular votes.  This is 
just like what happened in Algeria 15 years ago. It is very 
obvious what President Bush wants:  a Palestinian government 
which will not resist against the Israeli occupation -- 
ongoing for the last 38 years.  He wants to see every regime 
in the Middle East serving nothing but US interests."
