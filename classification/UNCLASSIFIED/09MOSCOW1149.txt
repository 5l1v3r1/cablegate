SUBJECT: RUSSIA SURPRISED BY URGENT MEETING OF CONTACT 
GROUP ON PIRACY 
 
REF: A. STATE 45157 
     ¶B. 08 MOSCOW 3508 
 
¶1. (SBU) We delivered ref A demarche on May 5 to MFA 
Department of New Threats and Challenges Attache Azamat 
Nurgushiyev, who expressed the MFA's surprise at the U.S. 
proposal to hold a Contact Group meeting on May 29 in New 
York.  The GOR had expected the meeting to be held in July, 
following the conclusion of the piracy working group meetings 
underway in various locations.  Nurgushiyev said that Russia 
would be represented at the Contact Group meeting by 
officials from Moscow, although he could not predict at what 
level.  He thought it likely that the MFA and MOD would be 
represented as the ministries that have the lead on piracy, 
and possibly the Ministry of Transport, which deals with 
merchant shipping issues.  Nurgushiyev asked that Russia be 
sent a formal invitation to the May 29 Contact Group meeting. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Nurgushiyev could not explain President Medvedev's 
proposal to establish an international court to prosecute 
pirates, which, he said, the GOR interagency process was only 
just beginning to examine.  According to press reports, on 
May 5, Medvedev urged Russian prosecutors to discuss with 
their foreign counterparts the possibility of establishing an 
international body to try pirates such as the 30 currently 
held by a Russian naval vessel off the coast of Somalia. 
Nurgushiyev thought that the GOR might be able to present 
details at the Contact Group meeting in New York, or at the 
next working group meeting that focused on the legal side of 
counter-piracy efforts. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Nurgushiyev could not elaborate on the GOR's 
approach to tackling piracy other than to say that Russia 
would continue to have a ship off the coast of Somalia to 
assist international anti-piracy efforts.  He explained that 
piracy had only recently been handed to the Department of New 
Threats and Challenges, which would take the lead on the 
issue while working in conjunction with the MFA Africa and 
Legal departments. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  We understand from our MFA contacts that 
there has been something of a turf battle within the Ministry 
over piracy, with various offices seeking to either take the 
lead or deflect responsibility for the issue (ref B).  The 
MFA has also proven unable to provide details on the Russian 
naval response to piracy and directed us on several occasions 
to the MOD, suggesting problems within the GOR interagency 
process as well.  These factors appear to have stymied the 
GOR's ability to provide much on its views on combating 
piracy.  We will report septel as additional information 
becomes available.  End comment.
