SUBJECT: CHILE MEDIA REACTION - UNSC AND PANAMA CANDIDACY 
 
 
¶1. On November 3, conservative, independent "La Tercera" (circ. 
101,000) ran an editorial entitled "Consensus Card for the Security 
Council."  Quotes: 
 
"Panama has the conditions to garner the region's support....  From 
the political perspective, it is well established in an intermediate 
position and can hardly be accused of having greater harmony with 
any of the more notorious geopolitical axis (Guatemala was 
considered a U.S. "card" and Venezuela, the region's leader of the 
strongest positions against the White House....) In addition, its 
geographic location has a symbolic value, in that it hooks Central 
and South America. 
 
"Panama's election in the General Assembly...is now a mere 
formality.  But this does not mean that its two years in the council 
will be a mere formality.  Although it is true that the leading 
voices are those countries with permanent seats and the right to 
veto..., it is likely...that issues of extreme importance will have 
to be resolved in the next two years....  It does not escape us that 
(Venezuela's) not winning a seat in the council and losing to 
Guatemala on all counts is a significant blow for Venezuela...which 
adds to the defeat in several recent elections in the region of 
candidates who support him (Chavez)." 
 
¶2. On November 2, conservative, afternoon "La Segunda" (circ. 
33,000) carried an editorial entitled "Latin America's Weakness." 
Quote: 
 
"The long process to find a representative of the Group of Latin 
American Nations to the UNSC...was finally resolved with a proposal 
in favor of Panama....  Chile...readily said it would favor the 
consensus bid....  Venezuela's Foreign Ministry said that what has 
occurred is positive and that he has learned some important lessons: 
an evident one is President Chavez' inability to show himself as the 
region's leader.  But, unfortunately, what was truly evident was the 
region's disunion...compared to other geographic blocs....  In this 
context, there is not much we can expect from the upcoming Summit of 
Chiefs of State and Government....  The absence of a solution (in 
the UNSC) is already a bad signal."
