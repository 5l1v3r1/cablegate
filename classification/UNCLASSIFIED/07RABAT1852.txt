SUBJECT: OSAC/CRIME SAFETY REPORT FOR MOROCCO 
 
REF: 06 STATE 199547 
 
¶1.  (U) The following information is keyed to requirements 
posed in reftel. 
 
¶I.  CRIME/SAFETY:  Though crime has generally not posed a 
significant risk to visitors in terms of personal safety, it 
is necessary to take prudent security precautions appropriate 
for any major American city.  The U.S. Mission has noticed an 
increase in crime throughout Morocco.  Most criminal 
incidents perpetrated against visitors are 
non-confrontational, although violent crimes occur. 
Pick-pocketing and purse/valuable snatching remain the most 
reported type of incident, generally occurring in crowded 
city centers, medinas, or high volume pedestrian streets. 
Theft of items from occupied vehicles occurring at traffic 
lights or while stopped in heavy traffic appears also to be 
on the rise.  However, there are indications, particularly in 
larger cities, that criminals are becoming more brazen and 
willing to confront victims or use weapons.  Some of these 
incidents have occurred in broad daylight in the nicer 
neighborhoods in Casablanca and Rabat.  Though the use of 
firearms is rare, street robberies, generally carried out at 
night, are being reported more frequently.  In some cases, 
the perpetrator has brandished a knife or bladed instrument 
to ensure quick compliance.  While some of these acts are 
random, police have arrested organized groups carrying out 
more sophisticated targeting of individuals, homes or 
businesses. 
 
Morocco experiences a high number of traffic accidents and 
fatalities every year due to both road conditions and driving 
habits.  Though there is a major effort underway to enforce 
speed limits and rules of the road, it remains an area where 
visitors should exercise great care.  Police have established 
a number of checkpoints in an effort to validate driving 
permits and the safety condition of vehicles.  If pulled over 
for a traffic violation, the driver must be able to provide a 
passport and/or international driver's license.  Confiscation 
of the driver's license is possible if the violator is unable 
or unwilling to settle the fine at the time of the traffic 
stop.  Taxi and bus drivers, particularly those transporting 
multiple persons between cities, may operate poorly 
maintained and overcrowded vehicles in a reckless manner. 
 
II.  TERRORISM/POLITICAL VIOLENCE:  In March and April 2007 
there were a series of terrorist bombings in Casablanca.  In 
August a suicide bomber targeted a tourist bus unsuccessfully 
in Meknes.  The potential for terrorist violence against 
American interests and citizens remains high in Morocco. 
There is draft GOM legislation that has earmarked 30 per cent 
of the State's 2008 budget for security.  Moroccan security 
services continue to disrupt terrorist cells throughout 
Morocco.  The terrorist groups arrested over the past several 
years have generally been associated with radical Islamic 
extremism, and some have been associated with regional and 
international terrorist groups.  Moroccans who have emigrated 
have been implicated in terrorist attacks abroad, such as the 
Madrid train bombings.  Additionally, issues such as U.S. 
Middle East policy and the war in Iraq have on occasion 
generated large public protests.  Politically inspired 
protests are more likely to occur in the city center or near 
Moroccan government or internationally-affiliated facilities. 
 For the most part, these gatherings have remained peaceful 
and well-controlled and groups are not normally allowed to 
congregate in the vicinity of diplomatic facilities.  Groups 
are required to obtain government approval prior to holding 
any public rally, march or protest.  A spontaneous or 
non-approved demonstration may pose greater potential for 
political violence than those that are approved beforehand 
that allow police to set parameters and maintain control. 
Clashes have occurred at universities between factions over 
the status of the Western Sahara, which remains a politically 
charged regional issue. 
 
III.  POST-SPECIFIC CONCERNS:  Visitors traveling to Morocco 
on business should be aware that English is not widely spoken 
and that most business transactions are normally conducted in 
French, although Arabic is the most widely spoken language in 
Morocco.  Since Morocco is an Islamic country, it is also 
beneficial and recommended for visitors to be aware of 
cultural sensitivities associated with Islam. 
 
During the rainy season, from November to March, flash 
flooding can impact Morocco's many rural mountainous roads 
and pose a threat to travelers as flooding can quickly wash 
away a road. 
 
IV.  POLICE RESPONSE:  The Moroccan police force is patterned 
on the French system, with the Surete National enforcing law 
in the urban areas, and the Gendarmerie in the rural areas. 
Moroccan law enforcement officers are relatively well 
trained, and law enforcement officials have pursued 
additional training and expertise through international 
exchanges and training assistance programs. The Moroccan 
police generally respond effectively to a report of crime by 
a foreigner visiting the country.  Quick investigative 
reaction to a criminal complaint by a visitor has at times 
resulted in an immediate arrest.  It is important therefore 
to report any incident quickly to the police.  Moroccan 
police normally conduct business in either French or Arabic. 
English translation may not be immediately available.  Should 
an American visitor require additional assistance, s/he 
should contact American Citizens Services at the U.S. 
Consulate in Casablanca. 
 
¶V.  MEDICAL EMERGENCIES:  Adequate medical care is available 
in Morocco's largest cities, particularly in Rabat and 
Casablanca, although not all facilities are of the highest 
quality.  Specialized care or treatment may not be available. 
 Medical facilities are adequate for non-emergency matters, 
particularly in the urban areas, but most medical staff will 
have limited or no English skills.  Most ordinary 
prescription and over-the-counter medicines are widely 
available.  However, specialized prescriptions may be 
difficult to fill and availability of medicines in rural 
areas is unreliable.  Emergency and specialized care outside 
the major cities is far below U.S. standards, and in many 
instances may not be available at all.  In the event of car 
accidents involving injuries, immediate ambulance service 
usually is not available.  The numbers below represent a 
sample of medical services available and should not be 
interpreted as necessarily recommended by the U.S. Embassy or 
Consulate.

VI.  TIPS ON HOW TO AVOID BECOMING A VICTIM:  Being well 
informed, understanding the culture, applying good common 
sense and practicing sound personal security measures can go 
a long way in ensuring an incident-free visit to Morocco. 
Thieves generally scan for easy targets of opportunity; 
therefore, visitors should avoid drawing undue attention by 
wearing expensive jewelry, outlandish or descriptive clothing 
items, or generally appearing unfamiliar with the 
environment.  If a deal sounds too good to be true, it 
probably is.  When unfamiliar with an area (particularly at 
night), it is advisable to utilize the &petit taxi8 service 
available in all large cities.  When driving, windows should 
be rolled up with doors locked, and it is against the law to 
drive while talking on a cell phone.  Train travel in Morocco 
is considered safe and reliable.  Establishments that could 
be perceived as catering to U.S or western interests, such as 
hotels, clubs, restaurants and movie theaters, could be 
potential targets for terrorism.  Travelers should remain 
particularly alert and informed during periods of heightened 
tension in the country or region.  The Regional Security 
Office in Rabat or Casablanca remains the best source of 
information for the latest on the security situation.
