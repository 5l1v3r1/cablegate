Head of the Americas Desk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 Khachab responded that the GOL believes condemning the use 
of rape as an instrument of state policy is a worthwhile 
subject to address and likely would not oppose the U.S.'s 
draft resolution.

its Arab partners before taking a final position.
