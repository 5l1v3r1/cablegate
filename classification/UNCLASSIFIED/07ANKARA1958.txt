In Today's Papers 
 
Novak Article Draws Interest in Turkey 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others 
cover the July 30 Robert Novak piece, "Bush's Turkish Gamble," in 
which the Washington Post columnist claims US officials are working 
with their Turkish counterparts on a joint military operation to 
suppress PKK militants and capture their leaders in northern Iraq, 
which would avert a Turkish invasion of its neighbor.  The 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak says on page one that following a 
statement from Deputy Assistant Secretary Matt Bryza that the US 
would move against the PKK, Undersecretary of Defense Eric Edelman 
briefed Congress on a joint operation plan.  Hurriyet claims the 
plan was leaked to the press by those "who don't want it to happen." 
 Papers quote the US Embassy in Ankara and the Pentagon as saying 
that the US "recognizes that the PKK is a serious problem for 
Turkey," and that the US is "working closely with the Turkish and 
Iraqi governments to solve the problem." 
 
Editorial Commentary on Novak Column 
Calling the US administration "shameful" columnist Gungor Mengi 
blasts the US for not doing anything against the PKK.  In mainstream 
daily Vatan he writes: "The US continues to be shameful regarding 
the PKK.  When it comes down to terrorism against itself, the US 
sees no harm in hitting targets across the ocean.  But as far as the 
PKK is concerned, by its presence in Iraq, the US is a de facto host 
country for a terrorist organization which is harming its ally.   It 
is now only nostalgia to think of the US as a country of justice and 
freedom -- neither of them exists any longer.  The terrorist 
murderers are enjoying shelter in Northern Iraq, and they are 
directly or indirectly supported by American weapons as well as 
protected by the American and Barzani administrations.  The 
Washington Post article, if true, will only help the White House 
take the possibility of an operation against the PKK off the agenda 
because the plan has been unleashed.  And Turkish people will remain 
suspicious about a deliberate leak of this plan to the Washington 
Post." 
 
Sami Kohen writes in the mainstream Milliyet: "Given the reliability 
of Robert Novak as a journalist, his column needs to be taken 
seriously.  It does not really matter whether the plan was leaked by 
Congressional sources or by Pentagon/White House sources, the fact 
of the matter is that the US has finally thought of doing something 
concrete against the PKK following mounting pressure from Ankara. 
In fact, the US was planning to take action against the PKK but did 
not move forward until the election process was over.  The action 
plan demonstrates that the US has now taken an inarguably clear 
stance against the PKK and enhanced its cooperation with Turkey in 
this regard.  By taking a lead on this issue, the Bush 
administration also prevents a possible unilateral action by Turkey. 
 Now the question is whether Turkey will be satisfied with a limited 
operation against the PKK.  Turkish military analysts are saying 
that a limited operation to capture PKK leadership can be useful, 
but does not mean a complete end to PKK terrorism.  At this stage, 
knowing what Turkish government and military think on this issue is 
as important as the US plan." 
 
Military Breaks Silence 
All papers report the chief of Turkish General Staff (TGS) General 
Yasar Buyukanit on Monday reiterated at a reception that the 
military wanted the next president to uphold secular values.  "We 
are still behind what we said," Buyukanit told reporters when asked 
whether he stood behind his statement on April 12, in which the 
military chief had maintained that the new president must adhere to 
the principles of a secular democratic state -- not only in words 
but in essence.  Papers point to the fact that these were the first 
comments from the Turkish military on the subject since Prime 
Minister Erdogan's AKP won a landslide victory in July 22 
parliamentary elections.

Meanwhile, the deputy chief of the TGS General Ergin Saygun told 
reporters that "a legal counselor" from the Pentagon has visited the 
Turkish General Staff recently to explain that the US did not supply 
weapons to the PKK.  "According to the Pentagon, some US weapons 
supplied to the Iraqi security forces might have been given to the 
PKK," said General Saygun. 
 
Official Election Results 
All papers and TV channels report that the Supreme Election Board 
announced the official results of the July 22 general elections. 
The board said that participation in the elections was 84.25 percent 
and the votes of 1,602,000 voters were ruled invalid.  Based on the 
election results, AKP will have 341 seats in the parliament, CHP 112 
seats, MHP 70 and independents 26 seats.  One seat will remain 
vacant due to the death of MHP deputy Mehmet Cihat Ozonder, and 
parliament will convene with 549 deputies. 
The Election Board announced that three parties and independents 
crossing the threshold resulted in 28.5 per cent of the people going 
unrepresented - a figure composed of those who voted for other 
parties and those who did not vote. After the 2002 elections 45 
percent of the people were not represented in the resulting 
parliament. 
 
 According to parliamentary regulations, the parliament will convene 
on Saturday, August 4 and the new members of parliament will be 
sworn in.  The meeting will be chaired by the eldest member of the 
parliament, CHP deputy Sukru Elekdag.  The next move in the 
parliament will be to elect a new speaker. Mainstream Hurriyet gives 
the parliamentary time-table and says that the government is 
expected to read its program in parliament on August 11 and the new 
government will face a vote of confidence on August 16.  On August 
16 the parliament will start to accept the applications of the 
presidential candidates. 
 
Meanwhile, turmoil in the main opposition party CHP continues. 
Around 50 CHP mayors supporting Istanbul's Sisli district mayor 
Mustafa Sarigul urged Baykal yesterday to resign from the party 
chairmanship.
