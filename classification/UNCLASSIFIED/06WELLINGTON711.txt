REF: STATE 126603 
 
The following is post's response to questions concerning the 
pre-license check on application 05-050012588, for sale to 
Serious 
Shooters Limited in Auckland, NZ.  Due to limited Embassy 
staff it 
was not possible to make a site visit.  Information was 
instead 
obtained through an internet search and PE Counselor's 
telephone call to 
Richard Munt, reftel POC at Serious Shooters. 
 
1) When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
 --  According to a search of registered NZ companies 
(available on line at www.companies.govt.nz), the company was 
incorporated on 10 August 1994. 
It's Directors are Grant Selwyn BEESLEY and Murray Ellison 
GARRETT. 
 
2) Who are the firm's typical customers and where are they 
located? 
 
 -- According to Munt, the company's customers are primarily 
hunters 
and recreational shooters.  All who purchase firearms and 
finished 
ammunition must have licenses, which are inspected and 
recorded by 
the company before sale. There is no need for the company to 
view 
licenses of those purchasing parts. 
 
3) Does the company have an established, legitimate customer 
base to which it plans to sell these commodities? 
 
-- Yes, see question 2, above 
 
4) Does the company have adequate on-site security? 
 
-- According to Munt, all firearms are kept in a bank safe 
with 
2 1/2 ton door and 16-inch thick walls, well in excess of 
NZ government requirements.  All windows are heavily grilled 
and 
in most cases walled in. 
 
5) Does the company keep proper, detailed records of its 
sales and customers? 
 
-- Yes. 
 
6) Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) articles, particularly regarding 
re-exporting (no re-export without USG authorization)? 
 
-- Yes.  They do not re-export any USML products.  If they 
did, 
the shipments would need to be approved by the Government of 
New 
Zealand as well as the U.S. State Department. 
 
7) Does the company have the proper firearms license and 
import permit for the items listed on the license 
application? 
 
-- Yes. 
 
8) In post's assessment, is the company a reliable recipient 
of USML items? 
 
-- Yes.
