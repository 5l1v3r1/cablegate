¶1. Summary:  PMA Counselor, EXBS Advisor, and Coordinator 
visited Port of Mersin and Cilvegozu Port of Entry on the 
Syrian border with GOT's inter-agency working group on 
non-proliferation issues to familiarize PMA staff and 
interagency with Customs inspection and enforcement 
procedures and logistical capabilities on their southern 
border.  Advisor provided MFA tentative schedule of EXBS 
initiatives requested by GOT interagency.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. Completed Actions for the Reporting Period: 
 
¶A. Meetings During Recent Reporting Period by EXBS Advisor 
and Coordinator: 
 
1) Feb 02 - We met with MFA Nonproliferation and Disarmament 
Department Head Elif Ulgen to review final details for the 
upcoming visit to the southern border with Syria and the Port 
of Mersin. Ulgen noted that the Turkish delegation would 
consist of two Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) officials, 
one TAEK technical expert, one Foreign Trade official, one 
Customs Enforcement official, two Custom Inspection 
officials, and one Intelligence officer.  Advisor provided a 
list of activities that EXBS was ready to deliver from the 
GOT interagency list, and confirmed that MFA was ready to 
approve a three-day Analysis of Strategic Commodity Transfers 
(ASCOT) Workshop in Ankara for March 17-19, a two day US 
Experts professional exchange of information of US programs 
for Government to Industry Outreach in Ankara during the 
first two weeks of April, and a five day Targeting and Risk 
Management workshop to be held in Ankara in May 2009. 
 
2) Feb 4-5 - PMA Section Chief, Advisor, and Coordinator 
accompanied Turkish delegation to the maritime Port of Mersin 
and the Cilvegozu Port of Entry on the Syrian border just 
east of City of Antakya (see reftel). 
 
3)  Feb 17 - Advisor and Coordinator met with 
Nonproliferation Interagency, including representatives from 
Turkish Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade (UFT), Turkish 
Customs and Customs Enforcement, Turkish Atomic Energy 
Authority (TAEK) and Ministry of National Defense (MND), to 
discuss upcoming Analysis of Strategic Commodity Transfers 
(ASCOT) Workshop in Ankara for March 17-19.  We provided a 
brief overview of the goals of the workshop and provided a 
sample agenda to each agency.  The interagency agreed that 
DOE should provide all participants with workbooks and slide 
presentations in Turkish, and requested one copy in English 
to each agency to ensure technical details are accurately 
relayed for future analysis.  They requested that the 
workshop use the EU control list with technical 
specifications and that UFT would seek approval to bring a 
copy of the new combined Turkish Control list with technical 
specifications to the workshop for reference purposes.  TAEK 
noted during this meeting that they already provide extensive 
training on Nuclear materials/components to all agencies and 
stated a brief review of nuclear components would be 
appropriate from US participants.  At the end of this 
meeting, we provided UFT, TAEK, MFA and Customs with a copy 
of the XRF 3-day training agenda to review before the XRF 
demonstration.  TAEK and Customs both expressed interest in 
the XRF Demo and possible deployment to Custom POE's, once a 
thorough review of the XRF units and databases was concluded. 
 
4) Feb 19 - Discussed the procurement of additional 
enforcement and detection related equipment under a new 
ISN/ECC task order with Customs Enforcement Head of 
Department Ender Gurleyik.  Gurleyik confirmed Customs 
Enforcement needed Inspection Tool Kits (basic tools, pry 
bars, screw drivers, etc. for secondary inspection areas 
(5-6)  additional Gerber tools and flashlights (200 ea. 
Buster density units (15), Laser measuring tool for 
container/trailer inspections (50), additional SABRE 4000 
Chemical Analyzers (5), and Video optic scopes (5- GE XL Go 
Video probes).  We also provided Gurleyik with a sample 
Targeting and Risk Analysis training agenda and proposed a 
May/June 2009 target date for this course to be held in 
 
ANKARA 00000353  002 OF 002 
 
 
Turkey.  Gurleyik noted that he would need to discuss this 
within Customs and would confirm date with us in the near 
term.  It was noted that Customs received a general TRM 
course in 2007 and that they would like for this course to be 
tailored to either rail or Seaport POEs, but would confirm 
the specific focus for this course when they confirmed the 
dates.
