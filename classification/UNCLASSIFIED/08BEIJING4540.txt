  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S. DIOPLOMACY 
 
a. "Obama doesn't love Japan and doesn't necessarily love China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (12/15): "During the American transition, the 
Chinese and Japanese media are usually very enthusiastic in 
discussing who will be favored by the new government. Some members 
of the Chinese media have expressed their happiness that the new 
U.S. Government will place more emphasis on China than on Japan. 
China should realize that the U.S. decides who to favor based on 
serving strategic interests. Obama favoring Japan does not mean he 
will not favor China and vice versa. This debate reflects the 
competitive spirit and hostility that happens between China and 
Japan. It also reflects that the two countries judge themselves 
based on the U.S. opinions and they are not independent in their 
opinions. This is not the general pain of the whole Asia. Both China 
and Japan, as well as other Asian nations should reject the negative 
influence left by Western colonization as soon as possible." 
 
b. "Will Obama give up America's missile defense plan?" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao)(12/15): "Next week, the U.S. and Russia will conduct a 
negotiation on the anti-missile issue. Moscow thinks that it is 
possible that Obama will reconsider the anti-missile system plan. 
There are still some uncertainties concerning the U.S. deploying an 
anti-missile system in Eastern Europe. Some Western allies of the 
U.S. have expressed dissatisfaction about this plan. The U.S.'s plan 
to deploy this system in Eastern Europe has an obvious Cold War 
mentality and is mostly for strategic deterrence. The financial 
crisis has given the U.S. a chance to reconsider its strategy. 
People hope that Obama could consider its anti-missile deployment 
plan from a high level of strategic stabilities in the world and 
devote America to the world's peace and development." 
 
¶2. GREECE 
 
"What lessons can China learn from the riots in Greece?" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(12/15): "Analysts 
believe that continuing riots have profound reasons behind them. For 
example Greek analysts indicated that the core issue is the 
government's economic policy and officials' scandals. When society 
is in crisis, government's public credit is deeply challenged. For 
example whether or not officials endure difficulties with the public 
together and whether or not they have the same rights as officials. 
No matter under which social system, as long as power inequalities, 
corruption or the gap between the rich and the poor exist, the great 
potential for social risks is being hidden. The riots in Greece 
symbolize the fact that the economic crisis brings social upheaval. 
China may have certain understandings about financial crisis and is 
prepared to deal with the crisis, but they are in short supply of 
preparations and sound resolutions in order to avoid the social 
risks. The riot in Greece has enlightened China."
