SUBJECT: FIERY RHETORIC OVERSHADOWS LOW TURNOUT AT HUMAN 
RIGHTS ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE 
 
 
1.(U) Summary:  Speeches critical of GOT policies, and 
graphic video clips of Turkish soldiers beating demonstrators 
overshadowed low attendance at this year's annual Human 
Rights Association (HRA) conference in Ankara.  HRA President 
Yusuf Alatas called on the GOT to adopt a new constitution 
strengthening civilian control of the military and respecting 
basic human rights, and advocated a "comprehensive social 
movement" to end violence in the southeast.  Such public 
criticism, unthinkable a decade ago, in itself shows the 
significant progress Turkey has made on human rights.  The 
current challenge is for the HRA and its brethren to 
reenergize the public's interest in reform on complex but 
critical human rights issues such as freedom of expression 
and women's rights.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Fiery Rhetoric Overshadows Low Attendance 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.(U) A diverse array of human rights activists from NGOs and 
academia came together in Ankara on November 4-5 at the HRA's 
annual conference to elect a new president and approve the 
group's annual activity report.  Despite the organization's 
prediction that at least 500 would attend the event, which 
fell on the group's twentieth anniversary, approximately 200, 
including some 40 women, took part.  Diplomatic 
representation was limited to Denmark, Canada, and the US. 
The only politicians present were ruling AK party 
parliamentarian and human rights committee member Ersonmez 
Yarbay, and Democratic Society Party (DTP) Vice Chair Sedat 
Yurttas. 
 
3.(U) The conference opened with a stirring 20-minute film 
that took the viewer through 20 years of Turkish history 
through the eyes of the HRA.  The film showed graphic clips 
of Turkish soldiers beating seemingly non-violent protesters 
after the 1980 military coup, southeastern villages that were 
torched in the 1990s, relatives mourning loved ones allegedly 
killed by the military, and the aftermath of an attempt in 
1998 to assassinate HRA founding President Akim Birdal in his 
Ankara office. 
 
4.(U) In his keynote address opening the conference and 
commemorating the HRA's twentieth anniversary, HRA President 
Yusuf Alatas, an attorney well-known for his courtroom 
oratorical skill, condemned the GOT for numerous human rights 
violations.  Alatas blamed the GOT for recent deaths from 
flooding in the southeast due to its neglect of the region, 
and criticized the government for its lack of progress on 
freedom of expression, reducing military influence on 
politics, women's rights, and extrajudicial killings.  He 
called for Turkey to adopt a new constitution that 
strengthens civilian control of the military, allows for 
education in one's mother-tongue, strengthens local 
government, and respects basic human rights such as freedom 
of expression. 
 
5.(U) Alatas also called for a "comprehensive social 
movement" to end violence in the southeast and create lasting 
peace.  He told the audience that the civilian government, 
along with labor groups, human rights organizations, NGOs, 
academia, and the media should work togeter to create 
policies that will create peace in the southeast and end the 
need for constant military intervention. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Western Powers Blamed for Harming Human Rights in 
Post-September 11 World 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
6.(U) Shifting the focus away from Turkey, Alatas lashed out 
at "imperialist western powers" for harming human rights 
worldwide in the post-September 11 world.  Organizations such 
as the IMF, World Bank, and WTO said Alatas, have harmed the 
poor through privatizing public services.  He blamed the 
United States and its allies for using the United Nations as 
a means to legitimize "illegal wars" in Afghanistan and Iraq 
while ignoring humanitarian crises in Sudan and elsewhere. 
Finally, Alatas condemned a new western mentality that 
considers torture as a legitimate tool.

HRA President Yusuf Alatas Re-appointed for Two-Year Term 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
7.(U) On Sunday, the HRA elected is executive board, which in 
turn re-appointed Yusuf Alatas to another two-year term as 
president.  According to Alatas, he agreed to continue as 
president to maintain consistent and firm leadership during 
the current PKK cease-fire and a generally critical period 
for human rights in Turkey.  During the remainder of the 
conference delegates debated and ultimately approved the 
HRA's annual activity report. 
 
8.(U) Comment:  The content of the speeches and video at the 
HRA conference in itself demonstrates that Turkey has made 
significant progress on human rights.  A decade ago, it would 
have been bold to attack the GOT in public for its policies 
on Kurds or other human rights issues, and downright 
dangerous to show graphic footage of Turkish soldiers beating 
civilians.  This progress may have contributed to a more 
apathetic atmosphere, reflected by lower-than-expected 
attendance at the conference.  The  challenge the HRA and 
other human rights activists in Turkey now face is to 
reenergize the public on complex but critical human rights 
issues such as freedom of expression and women's rights.  End 
comment.
