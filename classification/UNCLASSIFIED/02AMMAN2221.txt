SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON BOYCOTT OF U.S. AND ISRAELI PRODUCTS 
DELIVERED TO JORDAN 
 
REF: (A) STATE 84703 (B) AMMAN 2093 
 
¶1. (SBU) On May 6, Poloff conveyed reftel points on the 
boycott issue to Ali Al-Ayed of Foreign Minister Muasher's 
Private Office.  Al-Ayed offered no substantive comment but 
promised to convey the message to FM Muasher who is currently 
in Washington with King Abdullah and other senior members of 
the GOJ. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Post continues to support business 
community efforts to find appropriate responses to popular 
calls to boycott U.S. products and services (ref b).  The 
local Amercian Chamber of Commerce is working quietly to 
ensure that opinion-makers in the media and elsewhere are 
aware of the potential costs of a boycott to Jordan.  The GOJ 
fully recognizes the potential negative consequences an 
anti-American boycott could have and will do what it can to 
ensure that one does not materialize.  The Jordanians are 
hoping for progress on the political front that would defuse 
the calls for a boycott and other steps promoted by 
anti-normalizers.
