------------------- 
Unemployment Climbs 
------------------- 
 
¶1.  Moroccan Government unemployment statistics registered 
10.9 percent during the third quarter of 2005, up half a 
percent from the same period one year earlier.  The economy 
created 65,000 jobs in the building and public works sector, 
and 41,000 in services; but it lost 24,000 jobs in industry 
and 43,000 in agriculture, fishing and forestry. 
Unemployment in urban areas grew from 17.5 to 17.6 percent, 
and rural from 3.0 to 3.9 percent.

Morocco Buys Five Boeings 
------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Moroccan national flag carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM) 
will purchase five Boeing 787 Dreamliners under a contract 
signed in Casablanca in November.  The contract, worth a 
reported $650 million, is the outcome of a request for 
tenders launched by RAM in July to replace its B767s and 
B757s.  Boeing will deliver the first airplane in October 
¶2008.  The Moroccan carrier says it will purchase 24 medium 
haul aircraft by 2012, part of an ambitious program to 
reinforce and modernize the company's fleet.

Morocco Wins UN Microcredit Prize 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Morocco won the UN's "International Year of Microcredit" 
Prize for its efforts to develop microfinance.  The prize 
was awarded in a ceremony at UN headquarters on the margins 
of the Microfinance International Forum.  Morocco is the 
first country from the North Africa and Middle East region 
to win the prize.  Some 2.8 million micro-loans were granted 
in Morocco through the end of September, worth $810 million. 
The country counts 12 micro-credit associations that serve 
almost 600,000 clients, 68 percent of whom are women. 
Morocco seeks to reach one million clients by 2010.

Morocco's First Plant for Plastic Waste Recycling 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4.  The first plant for plastic waste recycling in Morocco 
will be set up under an agreement signed with the group Jet 
International (Julian Environmental Technologies), one of 
the two inventors of a process related to the recycling of 
plastic waste.  The $2.2 million project will be partly 
funded by an Italian government loan.  The plant will 
recycle 1,000 tons of plastic waste into finished products 
such as gutters and duckboards in the first year, and twice 
that in subsequent years.  Morocco produces an average 6.5 
million tons annually of household waste.

Morocco Joins Europe's GALILEO Program 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  On December 13 Morocco formally joined the EU's Galileo 
program, becoming the first African country and the first in 
the Arab world to do so.  Negotiations began in April.

Morocco Holds 15 Percent of World's Cork Oak 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Cork oak forests cover almost 400,000 hectares in 
Morocco, giving the kingdom 15 percent of the land covered 
by cork oak worldwide.  Morocco's cork forests are located 
mainly on the Atlantic plains, central highlands, and the 
Rif mountains in the North.  Cork gathering and oak planting 
activities generate 250,000 workdays per year, accounting 
for the employment of around 1,000 people.  Some 15,000 tons 
of cork is harvested annually, generating $12 million per 
year, or 38 percent of the country's total forest product 
revenue.  Ninety-five percent of Moroccan cork production is 
exported, mostly to Portugal and Spain.
