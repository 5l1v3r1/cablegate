In Today's Papers 
 
Women's Role in the Development of OIC States 
All papers:  The first ministerial level international conference 
sponsored by the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) started in 
Istanbul with PM Erdogan's giving opening remarks.  Themed as 
'Women's Role in the Development of OIC States,' PM Erdogan talked 
about the danger of discriminatory attitudes against women in Muslim 
societies and blamed the misinterpretation of Islam as opposed to 
the religion itself.  He characterized the discrimination against 
women as unacceptable and more dangerously primitive than racism. 
On the issue of honor killings, PM Erdogan said, 'This is a problem 
in Muslim societies.  These killings may be considered isolated 
cases instead of a systemic problem, however, we can't downplay 
these inhumane killings which are caused by ignorance.  Deputies, 
parties, NGO's, academic institutions, the private sector should all 
take responsibility. As the Turkish government we are open to all 
sorts of contributions in this regard.' 
 
Iraq and the PKK 
All papers:  Papers predominantly carry excerpts from a Washington 
Post article regarding the Pentagon's three option Iraq plan. 
Reportedly, the Pentagon is working on 'go big' 'go long' and 'go 
home' options for Iraq and making assessments of each.  Intellectual 
Radikal notes that the Bush administration is likely to adopt a 
hybrid plan, a combination of the second and the third option. 
Several Iraq-related stories are also highlighting a German Marshall 
Fund report on Iraq 'Rediscovering NATO' written by former 
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and GMF Director Ronald Asmus.  The 
report suggests that a NATO force stationed in Iraq can be a 
facilitator for the country's stability.  Mass appeal Hurriyet calls 
the report 'strange' because it advises that deployment of NATO in 
Iraq can also be a deterrent against Turkey making a cross-border 
operation. 
 
Cumhuriyet carried another follow-up story on the PKK's strong 
financial links in Europe by detailing some of the concerned 
businesses in France, Belgium and Germany.  The story highlights 
that some EU nations are applying a double standard on the fight 
against terrorism and giving clear support for PKK's survival in 
their homeland.  The story notes that all of these links were 
unleashed after Principal Deputy Coordinator Frank Urbancic's 
efforts and his recent contacts in Europe. 
 
Survey Calls for a United Left-Wing Front 
Cumhuriyet gives front page coverage to a survey carried out by 
polling company SONAR.  The survey shows that if the three main 
left-wing parties act together in the upcoming elections, they can 
garner up to 30 percent votes - more than the ruling AKP could get. 
A united left-wing and social democrat platform with DSP, CHP and 
SHP would receive 29.36 percent, with AKP receiving only 27.61 
percent of votes.  If there is no unification in the left-wing, 
there will be four parties represented in the next parliament, the 
SONAR survey concluded: AKP (24.35%), CHP (16.15%), DYP (11.69%) and 
MHP (11.49%). 
 
Meanwhile Milliyet asserts that CHP leader Baykal is very happy with 
remarks by MHP's re-elected leader Bahceli.  Baykal told the paper 
that it was important to hear an approach from the MHP that is 
nationalistic without ethnic discrimination.  Praising MHP's stance 
on preserving fundamental principles of the Turkish Republic, Baykal 
says it was good to hear a call for both the right and left wings to 
protect values which AKP constantly and deliberately erodes.  Given 
the remarks of Baykal, Guneri Civaoglu, a Milliyet columnist, 
wonders if the CHP and MHP are going to form a coalition after the 
next elections, and he concludes that nothing is impossible in 
politics. 
 
Bilgi University-Laureate Education 
Hurriyet, Vatan, Sabah, Yeni Safak, Aksam:  An Istanbul University, 
 
ANKARA 00006472  002 OF 002 
 
 
Bilgi, sold its 50 percent rights to American Laureate Education, 
Inc.  According to Turkish law, private universities are run by 
non-profit foundations.  Bilgi University Foundation Board has eight 
members and with this sale half of the executive board members will 
be represented by Laureate Education.  Aksam says Laureate has 
already named two representing members, associates of ARI Group (a 
Turkish NGO with US branches).  The other two names will also have 
to be Turkish origin, according to the regulation. 
 
TV Highlights 
NTV (7 am) 
 
Police arrested 29 leftist activists after breaking into the 
Associated Press office in Ankara to protest alleged mistreatment of 
prisoners in Turkey.  There were no reported injuries.  The 
activists are known for campaigning on behalf of families of jailed 
members of the DHKP-C, an outlawed Marxist group. 
 
The EU set a deadline of December 6 for Turkey to allow Turkish 
ports for Greek Cypriot vessels.  Government spokesman Cemil Cicek 
spoke negatively about this deadline and mentioned that the 
isolation against Turkish Cypriots must end first. 
 
The police have reported an alarming increase in juvenile 
delinquency. The number of crimes committed by children in the last 
six years has climbed to 400,000.   Issuing a statement for the 
World Children Rights Day, President Sezer asked for effective 
measures against the abuse of children. 
 
Prime Minister Erdogan emphasized that the elections would be held 
at the scheduled time and ruled out possibilities for early 
elections.
