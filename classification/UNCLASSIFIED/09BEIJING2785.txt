  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  U.S. SOUTHEAST ASIA POLICY 
 
"U.S. strategy for returning to Southeast Asia is gradually becoming 
clear" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao)(09/28)(pg 12): "At the G20 summit, President Obama said he 
wanted to hold the first ASEAN-U.S. summit in Singapore in November. 
 This is another step the U.S. has taken to adjust its East Asia 
policy.  Since the beginning of the year, the U.S. has made a number 
of diplomatic moves in Southeast Asia, which highlight the fact that 
its overall strategy for returning to Southeast Asia is beginning to 
take shape.  For example, on September 24, Secretary Clinton said 
that the U.S. will adjust its policy on Burma from implementing 
sanctions to establishing contacts.  This new U.S. relationship with 
Burma is seen as a breakthrough for the U.S.'s strategy in the 
region.  All these diplomatic moves by the U.S. are aimed at 
countering China's increasing influence in East Asia.  In the next 
several years, the U.S. will further increase its level of 
cooperation with ASEAN countries.  Its strategy toward four 
countries in particular - Vietnam, Burma, Laos, and Cambodia - 
deserves China's attention." 
 
¶2.  NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT 
 
"UNSCR 1887 emphasizes 'nonproliferation' but neglects 'nuclear 
disarmament'" 
 
The Beijing-based newspaper sponsored by official intellectual 
publication Guangming Daily and Guangdong Provincial official 
publication Nanfang Daily The Beijing News (Xin Jing Bao)(09/26)(pg 
A22): "The passing of UN Security Council Resolution 1887 
demonstrates the world's common stance on eliminating nuclear 
threats in all countries.  The resolution has been welcomed by those 
advocating weapons control and has brought urgently-needed emphasis 
to the dangers of nuclear weapons, technology, and proliferation 
around the world.  It is also seen as a recognition of Obama's 
proposal for 'a world free of nuclear weapons.'   However, experts 
argued that the resolution may encounter opposition within the U.S. 
itself.  And, although the resolution is indeed historic and shows 
that the UN Security Council has a key responsibility in addressing 
nuclear threats, critics point out that it did not contain 
requirements that nations take measures to achieve nuclear 
disarmament." 
 
¶3.  IRAN 
 
"China does not like the phrase 'punish'" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/27)(pg 1): "Iran is the country the West 
has the hardest time taming, so the West has now shifted its 
pressure onto China.  According to a Global Times poll, 20% of 
Chinese netizens support Chinese sanctions against Iran, while 80% 
oppose such sanctions.  China has important oil interests in Iran, 
but no one in China would want Iran to be able to make atomic bombs. 
 China's attitude on the Iran issue is contradictory.  Scholar Yin 
Zheng at the China Academy of Social Sciences argued instead that 
China's stance on the Iran issue is clear: first, the international 
non-proliferation regime must be respected; and second, the issue 
must be resolved politically.  Another scholar Wang Feng said that 
China's energy cooperation with Iran did not violate the new UN 
Security Council resolution on Iran.  Professor Jin Canrong at the 
People's University of China argued that if the UN really implements 
sanctions on Iran, China will finally take action together with the 
West since China must respect the mainstream opinion in the Arab 
world: that of the Sunnis.  Dr. Zhao Guojun at the Shanghai Academy 
of Social Science said that China advocates independent diplomacy 
and will not follow the West's lead.  China has the power to differ 
from the West and make its own decisions, in compliance with the 
interests of the international community."
