BEIJING 00001397  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1. Key points at the May 26 MFA press briefing: 
 
-- The Chinese government is "firmly opposed" to North Korea's 
nuclear test and "strongly urges" the DPRK to honor its commitments, 
stop moves that edge it closer to isolation, and return to the 
Six-Party Talks. 
 
-- Apologizing for the "political incident" on June 4, 1989 is "not 
appropriate." 
 
-- Aung San Suu Kyi's trial is an "internal judicial proceeding" and 
Burma's judicial sovereignty should be respected. 
 
 
North Korean Nuclear Test 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the May 26 regular press briefing, MFA spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu 
said North Korea had conducted a nuclear test despite the common 
opposition of the international community.  The Chinese government 
is "firmly opposed" to this action and "strongly urges" the DPRK to 
honor its commitments, stop moves that edge it closer to isolation, 
and return to the Six-Party Talks, he stated.  China calls for a 
"cool-headed approach to this matter," urges a peaceful resolution 
through consultation and dialogue, and supports relevant means by 
the UN Security Council toward those goals.  Safeguarding the peace 
and stability of Northeast Asia "serves the common interest of all 
parties concerned," Ma said.  As to whether North Korea notified 
China in advance of the launch, the spokesperson said China 
maintains communication with relevant parties, including the DPRK. 
After the test, China made direct representations to North Korea and 
maintained communication with other parties, he stated. 
 
¶4. As for reports that the DPRK had afterwards tested two 
short-range missiles, Ma said China had "taken note of relevant 
reports."  In response to a question about China's influence over 
North Korea's actions, Ma said China's diplomacy is conducted in 
accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, so 
China does not seek to influence other nations.  Regarding the South 
Korean government's intention to join the Proliferation Security 
Initiative (PSI), the spokesman said that China has taken note of 
the reports, that the security situation in Northeast Asia is 
complicated, and that China firmly opposes nuclear proliferation. 
Asked whether China would invite North Korean delegates to attend 
the October 1 ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the founding 
of the PRC, the spokesperson said China was still "making 
preparations." 
 
Tiananmen Apology 
----------------- 
 
¶5. Asked whether the Chinese government would apologize for the 
Tiananmen incident of June 4, 1989, Ma said the government has drawn 
the conclusion that the great achievements in economic development, 
democracy, and society since 1979 affirm that socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is in the fundamental interest of the Chinese people 
and apologizing for the "political incident" on June 4 is "not 
appropriate." 
 
Aung San Suu Kyi Trial 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. Asked whether China supports an ASEAN statement urging the 
Burmese authorities to release Aung San Suu Kyi, Ma said her trial 
is an "internal judicial proceeding" and Burma's judicial 
sovereignty should be respected.  China's principle of 
noninterference is unchanged, he stated. 
 
Pakistan Humanitarian Crisis 
---------------------------- 
 
¶7. Regarding the humanitarian situation in Pakistan, Ma said 
Pakistan is a "friend and neighbor" of China, and the PRC is paying 
close attention to ongoing developments.  In addition to the US$1 
million in cash for relief efforts already donated, China will 
donate another 30 million RMB ($4.4 million) in material assistance 
on May 27 as a "token of friendship."  This aid package will include 
water purification equipment, power generators, and medicine. 
 
New Prime Minister in Nepal 
---------------------------

¶8. China expresses its congratulations to Madhav Kumar Nepal in his 
election as Nepal's Prime Minister.  Sino-Nepalese relations are of 
"great importance," and China looks forward to furthering the 
friendship and partnership between the two countries, Ma stated. 
 
U.S.-China Talks on Sudan 
------------------------- 
 
¶9. At the invitation of PRC Special Envoy Liu Guijun, U.S. Special 
Envoy for Sudan Maj. Gen. Scott Gration visited China on May 25 to 
exchange views on Darfur and the North-South Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement.  SE Gration met with Liu Guijun and Assistant Foreign 
Minister Liu Jieyi during his visit, noted the spokesperson. 
 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Visit 
----------------------------- 
 
¶10. At the invitation of Vice Premier Wang Qishan, acting in his 
capacity as special envoy of President Hu Jintao, U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Timothy Geithner, in his capacity as special 
representative of President Obama, will visit China from May 31-June 
2 to discuss bilateral financial cooperation and the Global Economic 
Crisis, and also make preparations for the first U.S.-China 
Strategic and Economic Dialogue, stated Ma. 
 
Malaysian Prime Minister Visit 
------------------------------ 
 
¶11. At the invitation of Premier Wen Jiabao, Malaysian Prime 
Minister Najib Tun Razak will visit China from June 2-6, said the 
spokesperson.  It is his first visit since taking office.  Najib 
will meet with President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen, and the two 
sides will exchange views on bilateral issues and international and 
regional issues of common interest.  China and Malaysia will also 
sign comprehensive agreements during the visit, which is aimed at 
further enhancing Sino-Malaysian friendship, deepening cooperation, 
and "pushing the bilateral relations to a new level," said Ma.
