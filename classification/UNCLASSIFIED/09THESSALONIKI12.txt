SUBJECT: THESSALONIKI:  INVITATION TO TRANSBORDER COOPERATION 
CONFERENCE ON CYBER CRIME, JUNE 1-4 
 
¶1.  ConGen Thessaloniki is pleased to announce a training 
seminar for southeast European police officers and prosecutors 
on "Trans-border Law Enforcement Cooperation to Combat Cyber 
Crime" in the northern Greek border city of Drama on June 1-4, 
¶2009.  ConGen Thessaloniki is organizing the seminar in 
cooperation with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and 
the Southeast Europe Cooperation Initiative (SECI).   This will 
be the fourth consecutive year Post has held a regional seminar 
on trans-border cooperation, with previous topics including 
trafficking in persons, narcotics trafficking, illegal 
immigration and weapons smuggling.  As in previous years, FBI 
will cover the cost of foreign participants' transportation, 
lodging and per diem during the seminar.  Please see para 6 
below for a draft program of the seminar.  Posts that wish to 
send participants are asked to respond by March 26, and to 
provide a list of participants by April 2. 
 
¶2.  The primary aim of the training seminar is to build capacity 
in cyber forensics and promote practical cooperation among 
operational level police and prosecutors from countries of 
southeast Europe.  We can accommodate up to three (3) 
participants from each country (two police and one prosecutor), 
and invite Embassies Ankara, Sofia, Skopje, Belgrade, Tirana, 
Podgorica and Bucharest each to identify, vet and nominate three 
participants.  (There will also be three participants from 
Greece.)  We request that Posts nominate English-speaking 
participants, in order to facilitate discussion and to reduce 
conference translation costs.   Posts that are unable to find 
English-speaking participants should contact us to discuss 
alternative arrangements. 
 
¶3.  The seminar will develop cyber forensic investigative 
skills:  the use of computers and information technology to 
investigate a wide variety of crimes that at some point in their 
planning or execution involved the use of computers (or smart 
phones).   Such crimes include, for example, credit card fraud, 
bank fraud, identity theft, robbery, child pornography, rape, 
kidnapping, murder and terrorism.  The seminar will focus on 
hands-on training on techniques, recent successes and how 
cooperation led to success, case studies and the American 
experience in fighting cyber crime (almost any crime involving 
the use of computers).  The seminar is designed for participants 
who have responsibility for investigating or prosecuting cyber 
crime but are not yet experts.  Discussion will include best 
practices in investigation and prevention, including exchange of 
information and other cooperation among neighboring countries. 
The seminar will take place in a classroom-type setting with 
audiovisual equipment and a laptop for each participant. 
Participants should be able to use a laptop with Windows 
operating system and a standard English keyboard, and have at 
least basic knowledge of how to use the internet.  FBI and other 
USG experts will provide instruction and lead discussions in 
English. 
 
¶4.  The city of Drama is approximately 150 km from Thessaloniki 
and 50 km from the Bulgarian border.  Drama hosts an annual 
international film festival and is headquarters for some of 
Greece's finest red wine producers.  The seminar will be held at 
the "Kouros" Hotel.  Participants will stay at the "Kouros" 
hotel, 3 km outside of town, towards the neighboring city of 
Kavala. 
 
¶5.  Fund cites and other practical details will be provided in a 
separate message.  We are aware that in previous years a few 
participants have encountered difficulties with visas and other 
travel arrangements.  We are working closely with Greek 
authorities and conference organizers to avoid such difficulties 
this year.   For information, questions or to inform us of your 
post's interest in participating, please contact George 
Pelargidis at PelargidisG@state.gov or phone:  +30 2310 242 905
