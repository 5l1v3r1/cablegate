¶1. Mohamed al-Rumaihy, Assistant to the Foreign Minister and 
Vice Chairman of the Qatari National Committee for the Relief 
of the Lebanese People, told Ambassador August 22 that his 
country has spent USD 10-11 million post-conflict in Lebanon 
to date. He returned from a trip to Lebanon August 20 and 
will attend the Donors Conference in Sweden August 31. He 
said he did not yet know how much Qatar will pledge, but he 
had proposed USD 300 million over three years. He outlined 
Qatar's actions so far as follows: 
 
-- Donation of two mobile field hospitals (which continue to 
operate in various Lebanese towns); 
 
-- Contribution of one rescue team (which recovered 20 bodies 
and one person alive); 
 
-- Repair and equipping of one Red Cross and one government 
hospital in the south; 
 
-- Pledge to rebuild the southern Lebanese towns of Bint 
Jbail and al-Khiam (the cost of which he could not estimate); 
 
-- Establishment of 12 aid distribution stations in the 
country (handed over to Qatari charitable organizations for 
management); and 
 
-- USD 500,000 contribution to UNICEF for Lebanese children. 
(Rumaihy did not report this; comes from local news reports.) 
 
¶2. Embassy delivered reftel points to the Foreign Ministry 
August 23. Rumaihy had told the Ambassdor in the August 22 
meeting, however, that Qatar does not currently have plans to 
contribute military items beyond the field hospital, but he 
said Qatar could contribute some light equipment such as 
trucks. Qatar does not have the resources or authority 
to contribute advanced military hardware. A military officer, 
Rumaihy noted during his Lebanon visit that the 
Army needs capacity in a number of areas, including light 
infantry and military police. Post will continue to engage 
GOQ officials in the run-up to the August 31 conference in 
Sweden.
