¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Geomarketing, Yaroslaveskoe Shosse, 29B Str, 3, 
Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS license 
application: NLR as the ultimate consignee of one (1) 
geoelectrical instrument and apparatus with recording 
devices, electronic devices and components, spares and 
accessories and software.  ECCN 3A992 and 3A001. 
Controlled for anti-terrorism, national security, 
missile technology, and nuclear nonproliferation 
reasons. The exporter is Geometrics, 2190 Fortune 
Drive, San Jose, CA  95131. 
 
¶3. On July 21, 2008, Export Control Attach Peter 
Liston and LES Political Specialist Boris Karasyov 
conducted the requested post-shipment verification 
with Geomarketing, at 18 Okruzhnoy Proezd, Moscow, 
Russia, the location where the subject commodity was 
stored. The export control team met with Galina 
Bondarenko, Office Manager. 
 
¶4. Office Manager Galina Bondarenko met the Export 
Control Team outside 18 Okruzhnoy Proezd and escorted 
them to the Geomarketing office space.  Clearly 
visible upon entering were several prefabricated 
durable heavy equipment cases containing the subject 
reftel commodity. Galina Bondarenko stated that 
Geomarketing purchased the reftel commodity for 
engineering and geological purposes.  She stated that 
the commodity is used to test the ground for 
construction quality building materials.  Bondarenko 
indicated that Geomarketing would utilize this 
particular shipment from the U.S. exporter Geometrics 
as a display model and showcase it at various 
expositions for geological and building materials. 
Bondarenko stated that this equipment will be sent to 
its partner company Yamnl Trans Stray, located in the 
Siberian town of Labytabange, Yamnl for exhibition 
this week.  It will be returned to Geomarketing at the 
end of August.  Bondarenko opened two of the 
containers for inspection by the Export Control Team. 
She then explained the broad use and function of the 
equipment, indicating that Geomarketing selected this 
commodity over a similar Russian manufactured one 
similar because of the ease of its use and its single 
person operation.  The Russian version requires three 
operators. 
 
¶5. Geomarketing clearly has the technical and 
commercial sophistication necessary to make use of the 
subject commodity.  They have a legitimate need and a 
legitimate end use.  The equipment is brand new, 
having only recently cleared Russian Customs. 
Bondarenko was not evasive in answering any of the 
Export Control Team's questions and there are no 
indications of impropriety. 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post recommends Geomarketing, home 
address: Yaroslaveskoe Shosse, 29B Str, 3, Moscow, 
Russia as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities.
