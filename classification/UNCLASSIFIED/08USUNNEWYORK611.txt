IMMUNITY 
 
REF: 05 USUN NEW YORK 1205 
 
 ¶1.  The City of New Rochelle, NY, has contacted USUN/HC and 
sent a letter to both OFM/NY and USUN/HC requesting 
assistance to remove the diplomatic immunity from the Somalia 
UN Mission official residence at 250 Elk Avenue (see text of 
letter in para 2 and action request in para 5, below). 
 
 
 
¶2.  Begin text of July 3 letter from New Rochelle City 
Manager Charles B. Strome, III: 
 
 
"Re:  Request of an immediate lifting of diplomatic immunity 
to mitigate public safety hazards for Real Property Owned by 
the Republic of Somalia at 250 Elk Avenue, Block 2111, Lot 
50, City of New Rochelle, New York, 10801. 
 
Dear Ms. Winton and Mr. Graham: 
 
This communication is a request for your assistance in 
getting the necessary approvals for lifting diplomatic 
immunity for the City of New Rochelle to mitigate public 
safety hazards at 250 Elk Avenue. 
 
The City of New Rochelle has contacted your office to 
facilitate correspondence to the Republic of Somalia for the 
purposes of addressing Housing Code Violations, including 
maintenance of an in-ground swimming pool with an inadequate 
fenced area, broken windows, doors and other defects to 
exterior structures, the abandonment of motor vehicle(s) and 
vacancy of the residence.  Furthermore, the property is 
blighted with overgrown weeds, grass, and bushes.  The police 
were called to the residence on Sunday, June 29th due to a 
report of trespassing.  See attached violations with photos 
as of June 2008. 
 
The City has also received complaints from the Forest Heights 
Neighborhood Association, and inquiry from U.S. Congresswoman 
Nita Lowey's Office.  Although we recognize that diplomatic 
properties are normally considered inviolable, several 
attempts to get compliance have not been successful. 
 
Thank you for your time and consideration regarding this 
matter.  If granted permission, the City of New Rochelle will 
secure the most hazardous conditions per advisement of our 
Buildings Bureau with a report to your attention, including a 
copy of our abatement bill to the Republic of Somalia." End 
text. 
 
¶3.  This property has long been the subject of complaints 
from the City and from neighbors.  Per Reftel, following 
similar complaints in 2005, USUN/HC met with then Somali 
PermRep Hashi who requested the release of funds from the 
sale of its Embassy in Washington to repair the property. 
The property has been unoccupied since 2006.  In April, 
USUN/HC received photos alerting it to the continued neglect 
of the property (sent to Department via email).  USUN/HC 
approached Somali DPR Idd Beddel Mohamed who was preparing to 
leave NY to meet with government officials.  He told USUN/HC 
that he would seek permission to sell the property.  There is 
no evidence, however, that his requests have been successful 
and he has suggested that the USG may be able to influence 
the current government to act more quickly on the matter. 
 
¶4.  Meanwhile, the property continues to be a public safety 
hazard and USUN/HC has also been informed that DPR Mohamed 
has been interviewed by the NY Times for an article it 
intends to publish on problems communities have with 
diplomatic neighbors. USUN/HC recommends that Department use 
its contacts with the Somali Government to encourage 
immediate attention to secure the property and undertake the 
actions required by New Rochelle, or to sell it since it has 
been unable to maintain it safely for years. 
 
¶5.  ACTION REQUEST:  USUN/HC seeks Department guidance on a 
response to the urgent issues raised in the above letter.
