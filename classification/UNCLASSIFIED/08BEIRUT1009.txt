¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel demarche on supporting the 
Palestinian Authority to Oussama Khachab and Rana Mokaddem, 
officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Acknowledging 
the financial challenges faced by the PA, the MFA officials 
said it was nevertheless not financially feasible for Lebanon 
to provide assistance to the PA at this time.  Mokaddem 
explained that, given that international donors conferences 
are being held to garner support for Lebanon (citing in 
particular the Vienna donors conference held last month in 
support of reconstructing the Palestinian refugee camp Nahr 
al-Barid), the GOL could not afford to support the PA. 
 
¶2. (SBU) When asked about the outstanding pledge from the 
2002 Arab League summit, Mokkadem and contacts at the 
Ministry of Finance confirmed that the GOL has not made any 
payments on this pledge or on any other outstanding 
commitments to the PA.  Mokkadem clarified that the amount 
pledged by Lebanon was actually determined by the Arab 
League, which sets the pledge amounts for all member states. 
It is likely that Lebanon never intended to pay this amount, 
she said.  She concluded that the GOL would not be able to 
meet the pledge, while acknowledging that a smaller, symbolic 
amount (less than $1 million) could be plausible.  She said 
she would explore this further.
