REF: STATE 98012 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  Mission has urged Indonesia to support the 
United States' candidacy for the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) (Category "A") during the November 
23-December 4 IMO meetings in London.  Our interlocutors 
promised to review the U.S. candidacy carefully, adding that 
Indonesia would not likely announce its voting intentions in 
advance.  END SUMMARY. 
 
REVIEWING DIPNOTE AND AIDE-MEMOIRE 
 
¶2.  (U) Poloff reviewed reftel diplomatic note and 
aide-memoire urging support for the U.S. candidacy to the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) (Category "A") with 
Cicilia Rusdiharini, Deputy Director for North American 
Affairs, at the Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) on 
September 28.  Poloff noted to Rusdiharini that we are also 
making these points to other interested Indonesian ministries 
and agencies. 
 
THE USG'S STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE IMO 
 
¶3.  (U) Poloff underlined the United States' long-standing 
and positive contributions to the IMO.  He noted that the USG 
is an active member in every IMO body, including the Council. 
 We also provide continuous financial and technical support. 
Given all these reasons and more, the USG believes that its 
re-election to the Council will further contribute to the 
IMO's efforts of achieving safe, secure and efficient 
shipping on the oceans. 
 
GOI CONSIDERING ITS VOTE 
 
¶4.  (U) Rusdiharini promised that DEPLU and GOI interagency 
officials would carefully review our points as they decided 
how Indonesia will vote.  She agreed that the United States 
played an important role in international shipping and in the 
IMO.  She noted, however, that Indonesia did not normally 
announce in advance how it would vote in such elections.
