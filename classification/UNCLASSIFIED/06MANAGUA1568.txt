SUBJECT: NICARAGUAN ELECTIONS: REQUEST FOR OBSERVERS 
 
 
¶1. Embassy Managua is coordinating a USG electoral 
observation mission (EOM) for the Nicaraguan national 
elections on November 5, 2006.  Post is planning to field 
observation teams in Managua and several other Nicaraguan 
departments and regions.  We would like to invite up to 10 
officers from the Department, USAID, NSC and other posts to 
join the EOM. 
 
¶2. Officers considering volunteering for the EOM should take 
into account the following points: 
 
- All volunteers must speak and understand Spanish at the 3 
level or above. 
 
- Volunteers must plan to arrive no later than Thursday, 
November 2 and depart no earlier than Tuesday, November 7.  A 
training session will be held on Friday, November 3. 
 
- Funding for travel and per diem must be provided by host 
agency/office and should be sufficient to cover hotel and 
in-country transportation.  (Note: Hotels will be booked well 
in advance of the elections.  To ensure accommodations during 
this period, post will need to reserve rooms by mid-August. 
End Note.) 
 
- Volunteers must make a firm commitment by August 11 so that 
post has time to complete accreditation. 
 
- TDY volunteers will be paired with post personnel and a 
local guide. 
 
¶3. Many Nicaraguans compare the upcoming elections with the 
groundbreaking 1990 elections that ended Nicaragua's civil 
war.  These elections promise to be a historic confrontation 
between the entrenched forces of caudillismo and new 
politicians determined to strengthen democracy. 
 
¶4. Volunteers should contact Deputy Political Counselor 
Timothy L. Smith at 505-266-6010 x4481/SmithTL1@state.gov or 
USAID Elections Officer Danika Walters at 505-267-0502 
x245/dwalters@usaid.gov no later than August 11.
