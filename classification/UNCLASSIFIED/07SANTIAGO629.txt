SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - CHAVEZ, CHILE, AND BACHELET 
 
 
¶1. On April 17, business and financial "Diario Financiero" (circ. 
30,000) carried an editorial entitled "Problems with Venezuela." 
Quotes: 
 
"The new diplomatic impasse in which Chile finds itself due to 
President Hugo Chavez's statements against the Chilean 
Senate...confirms how imprudent it would have been to vote for that 
country in the UNSC.  It also poses an important challenge for 
international organizations such as the OAS, because of the almost 
unlimited power Chavez is acquiring in his country and the degree of 
interventionism he is exerting in the rest of the continent." 
 
¶2. On April 16, conservative, afternoon "La Segunda" (circ. 33,000) 
carried an editorial entitled, "Trip to Venezuela."  Quote: 
 
"Michelle Bachelet has responded with severity and determination in 
this situation, complying with her constitutional obligations.  We 
assume she will do the same in Venezuela.  Furthermore, what has 
happened (with Chavez) has helped to clarify... the risks and 
conflicts that the Chavista regime's regional policy entails, if 
there was ever any question about this."
