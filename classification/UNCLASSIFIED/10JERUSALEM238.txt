SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (02/10): President Abbas asks the 
US for clarification on the proposal to start indirect peace talks 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
-------------Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas is 
quoted in PA official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida responding to 
journalists in Tokyo about the Palestinian position on the US 
proposal to pursue talks with Israel by saying that the Palestinians 
did not put preconditions on these talks but wanted clarification 
from the Americans regarding this proposal. Abbas noted to 
independent daily Al-Ayyam that he expects to receive a response 
from Special Envoy George Mitchell within a week. Abbas is also 
quoted in Al-Ayyam saying that the PA will implement a large 
economic project on the Dead Sea that includes the establishment of 
a new city with hotels and resorts. 
 
In related news, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman noted 
that indirect peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis will 
start soon. 
The dailies report on the second day of confrontations between 
Palestinians and the IDF in Shufat refugee camp in East Jerusalem. 
The dailies also report on dozens of settlers attacking residents in 
the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem yesterday under 
full protection of the Israel police. 
 
The dailies front page news on PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad 
opening the Popular Conference for Supporting Bedouins in the Jordan 
Valley yesterday. Fayyad stressed that the Jordan Valley and all of 
Area C, as well as East Jerusalem, are integral parts of the 
Palestinian lands that were occupied in 1967. He also stated that 
the Jordan Valley constituted the eastern borders of an independent 
Palestinian state. 
 
Independent daily Al-Quds runs a report citing the Saudi journal 
"Al-Madina" that a well informed Egyptian source expects the 
Palestinian national reconciliation agreement to be signed this 
month. The source noted that the visit of Nabil Shaath to Gaza 
positively contributed to bridging the gaps between Hamas and Fatah 
regarding the reconciliation. 
 
Independent daily Al-Quds front pages news on protests at the 
University of California on Monday against the visit of Israeli 
Ambassador Michel Oren to the university. More than 700 students 
protested on the university campus and condemned Israeli measures 
against the Palestinians.

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Al-Quds runs an editorial under the title "Abu Mazen and 
Fayyad...The Two Politicians Who Embarrassed Israel" which urges 
Israeli officials to take advantage of having Abu Mazen and Fayyad 
as the Palestinian leadership at this stage and reach a peace 
agreement with them. The author praises the efforts of President 
Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad to establish an independent 
Palestinian state. The editorial also accuses Israel of not having 
any real intention to achieve peace with the Palestinians.
