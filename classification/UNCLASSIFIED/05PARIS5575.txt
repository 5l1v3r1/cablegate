Â¶1.  Given the Director General's campaign for re- 
election and the uncertainty of UNESCO's budget, 
senior post openings at UNESCO are unpredictable. It 
is worth noting at this point however, that now that 
US citizens are in the ADG Education position and 
the Deputy ADG of External relations position, it is 
unlikely that that a US citizen will be appointed 
for another ADG or Deputy ADG position.   The 
Mission will respond with upcoming vacancies, 
including Director posts, by December 2005, 
following the election of the Director General and 
the finalization of the 2006-2007 UNESCO budget. 
Should any vacancies become apparent before then, 
Mission will immediately notify IO/S.
