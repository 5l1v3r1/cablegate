BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Regular columnist Muhammad Yaghi opines in Al-Ayyam independent 
daily under the title, "What do we have to do with Iran?"(05/01) 
"What frightens Israel about dealing with Iran is not that the U.S. 
might abandon Israel, because that will never happen, but rather 
that Arab countries might abandon Israel and leave her alone to face 
the Iranian nuclear threat, especially since President Obama does 
not want more wars.  He believes that the best way to serve U.S. 
interests in the region is to through support for a Middle East 
peace process... Therefore, if Israel sees a threat in Iranian 
support to Hezbollah and Hamas, it should follow the new U.S. policy 
 
JERUSALEM 00000727  002 OF 002 
 
 
and open dialogue with Iran, instead of making war." 
 
2) Ibrahim Abu Shaaban opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the 
title, "Prisoners' Harassment by Israel and the U.S."(05/01):  "The 
U.S. President's decision to open an investigation into 
interrogation that took place in Guantanamo and expose all abuse... 
is a great decision and deserves praise...However, the U.S. must 
also correct all previous mistakes and force allies, particularly 
Israel, to prohibit all kinds of abuse and harassment in [Israeli] 
jails and consider imposing economic sanctions on those allies that 
fail to follow the new guidelines."
