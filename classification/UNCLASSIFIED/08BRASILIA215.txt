SUBJECT: EXTENSION REQUEST - KRISTIAN G. MOORE, BRASILIA (TED 
December 2008) 
 
 
¶1. (U) Kristian G. Moore (ESTH Officer 12/06-12/08) requests to 
extend his current assignment to Embassy Brasilia from 11/2008 to 
05/2009.  Mr. Moore requests the extension in order to be 
repositioned to the summer 2009 bidding cycle and also due to family 
considerations (allowing a child to finish the school year).  Mr. 
Moore would finish his current assignment to the ESTH section upon 
the arrival of his replacement and then move to the consular section 
as an NIV Officer. 
 
¶2. (U) With an additional NIV Officer (Mr. Moore has adjudicated 
visa applications in Brasilia already) Mission Brazil hopes to 
increase its visa productivity in the face of rising visa demand and 
also send Mr. Moore TDY to constituent posts when necessary 
(Brazil's NIV appointment backlogs are over 90 days).  He is a 
recently tenured officer currently in a JO slot which has already 
been backfilled (Long - ETA 9/08).  HR/CDA/EX and EL have been 
notified of Mr. Moore's request and Post understands that they are 
examining possibilities. 
 
¶3.  (U) Post supports this request and asks that WHA and CDA also 
support the request.
