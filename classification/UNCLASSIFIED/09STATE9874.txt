SUBJECT: INFORMATION RELATED TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
SAFEGUARDS FELLOWSHIP SEMINAR IN THE UNITED STATES 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an informational cable. 
 
Unclassified - entire text. 
 
¶2.  (U) SUMMARY:  The United States Department of Energy 
(DOE)/National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is 
sponsoring a three-week seminar on international nuclear 
safeguards from May 2, 2009 to May 23, 2009, in the United 
States (Seattle, WA; Richland, WA; Oak Ridge, TN) for 
students from countries planning to establish nuclear power 
programs.  Post-graduate students from Algeria, Egypt, 
Morocco, Tunisia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia 
will be invited to participate in the seminar, which will 
focus on fundamental issues, technologies, policies, and 
potential career paths associated with international 
safeguards.  While no Embassy action is requested at this 
time, Embassies will be requested to provide formal 
invitations at the appropriate time. END SUMMARY 
 
¶3.  (U) BACKGROUND:  The National Nuclear Security 
Administration (NNSA) of the United States Department of 
Energy (DOE) plans to conduct a three-week seminar on 
international nuclear safeguards from May 2, 2009 to May 23, 
2009, in the United States (Seattle, WA; Richland, WA; Oak 
Ridge, TN).  The event, sponsored by NNSA's International 
Nuclear Safeguards and Engagement Program (INSEP), will focus 
on fundamental issues, technologies, policies, and potential 
career paths associated with international safeguards. 
 
¶4.  (U) International safeguards are a fundamental, complex, 
and demanding component of a transparent and effective civil 
nuclear energy program.  The training and education of the 
next generation of international safeguards specialists has 
therefore become an urgent concern not only to aspiring 
nuclear countries, but also to the United States.  In order 
to help address this issue, INSEP plans to invite two 
post-graduate students each from Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, 
Tunisia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia to 
participate in a three-week seminar to learn about 
fundamental issues and best practicies associated with 
international safeguards. 
 
¶5.  (U) As part of the three-week seminar, participants will 
visit the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory where technical and policy experts from 
the United States will provide briefings and lead a variety 
of discussion groups and hands-on exercises to reinforce 
major learning objectives.  INSEP will also invite one expert 
each from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the 
National Nuclear Energy Commission of Brazil (CNEN), the 
Argentine Nuclear Regulatory Authority (ARN), and the 
Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of 
Nuclear Materials (ABACC) to participate in portions of the 
seminar as lecturers.  INSEP maintains productive 
partnerships with CNEN, ARN, and ABACC, and this seminar 
presents an opportunity to demonstrate the value of 
international cooperation to emerging nuclear countries, 
while stressing the importance of international safeguards. 
 
 
¶6.  (U) INSEP intends to use existing program contacts at the 
appropriate agencies in the invited countries to identify 
prospective post-graduate students for the seminar, but all 
invitations will come through the Embassies in the respective 
countries.  Any questions should be directed to Ms. Margot 
Mininni (margot.mininni@nnsa.doe.gov 202-586-8690) and Mr. 
Matthew Van Sickle (matthew.vansickle@nnsa.doe.gov 
202-586-2859) at DOE/NNSA/NA-242.
