Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam lead with news of Egypt delivering invitations 
to Palestinian factions for a national dialogue conference.  All 
papers report on details including Palestinian Authority President 
Abbas being invited to attend the opening session on November 9th. 
Five committees will be established to discuss the Egyptian proposal 
for Palestinian unity and report out 4 weeks later, according to 
reporting.  Al Quds reports separately on a telephone call between 
Abbas and his Egyptian counterpart on October 29.  The two leaders 
discussed Palestinian national dialogue, the peace process, and the 
recent U.S. military strike on Syria. 
 
Al Hayat Al Jadida leads with the arrival of the "international 
solidarity" boat to Gaza on October 29.  All front pages highlight 
photos of the boat.  In other Gaza news, Al Ayyam and Al Quds run 
front page comments by Israeli Defense Minister Barak threatening to 
use force to free kidnapped Israeli soldier Shalit from Gaza.  Barak 
also urged his government to make "difficult" decisions to secure 
Shalit's freedom before the formation of a new Israeli government. 
 
 
All front page run stories and photos of flooding in Gaza and the 
West Bank.  The papers quote Palestinian Authority (PA) Prime 
Minister Fayyad stating on October 29 that the PA would provide 
"everything possible" to assist Palestinians affected by the 
flooding in Gaza.  Fayyad also called on the international community 
to "immediately intervene" to "avert the disaster" facing the Gaza 
Strip, according to the papers.  Front pages note international 
assistance announced by Japan:  $10 million in direct budget support 
to the PA. 
 
Several "peace process" meetings are highlighted on front pages:  Al 
Ayyam quotes Israeli and American spokespersons revealing a meeting 
in the next few weeks between President Bush and Israeli Premier 
Olmert, while Al Quds reports that Secretary of State Rice will 
visit the region next week. The paper comments that the visit could 
be to, "show the world that the Bush administration is not a lame 
duck."  In a separate announcement, Al Quds' front page notes a 
November 4 meeting of the Middle East Quartet to take place in Sharm 
Al Sheikh, Egypt. 
 
The three papers run front page stories about the "cold-blooded" 
killing by Israeli soldiers of a 70-year old Palestinian at his farm 
in Al Yamun village, near the West Bank city of Jenin on October 29. 
 
 
Al Ayyam's front-page reports on an "extremist Jew" vandalizing the 
Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem.  Al Quds runs a similar 
inside story explaining that several crosses were damaged and monks 
attacked during the incident. 
 
The papers report on inside pages about a new partnership between 
USAID and Al Quds University in the area of legal studies.  The 
report reveals that the joint project was launched on October 29 in 
the presence of USAID Director Howard Sumka.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
1)  Regular contributor Talal Okal writes in Al Ayyam under the 
title, "Nothing more than nonsense" (10/30):  "There is nothing in 
 
JERUSALEM 00001974  002 OF 002 
 
 
[Israeli President] Peres' proposal that merits even a moment's 
thought.  [Peres] lacks any decision making power or influence over 
Israeli decision makers... So, can we expect Israel to accept the 
Arab initiative?  We might have if Palestinians and Arabs were in a 
better and stronger position, or if they were the party hindering a 
solution [to the conflict].  Given the current state of affairs, 
everything proposed by Peres is nothing but nonsense." 
 
2)  Abdullah Awwad opines in Al Ayyam under the title "Prices 
collapsed....but here they remain (steady)" (10/30):  "Our 
experience [of the siege] shows us clearly that ... as people 
continue to suffer from poverty and hunger...and economic 
hardship... our factions are spending large sums of money on 
armaments... that are ultimately used in an [internal] struggle for 
power and not in resisting the [Israeli] occupation..."
