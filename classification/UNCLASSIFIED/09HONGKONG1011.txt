REF: A) BIS e-mail request dated March 17, 2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) attempted 
to conduct a post shipment verification (PSV) at Sunfly Electronics 
(HK) Limited, Flat L, 11/F, Phase 3, Kwun Tong Industrial Centre, 
448-458 Kwun Tong Road, Hong Kong (Sunfly). The items in question 
for this PSV are various microprocessors exported to Sunfly on or 
about January 20, 2009.  On the applicable shippers export 
declaration (SED), these items are not classified meaning that they 
are likely EAR99 and eligible for shipment to virtually all 
destinations and end-uses/users worldwide.  The exporter was 
Mitronics, Inc. of East Rutherford, New Jersey. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Sunfly has been 
in existence since May 2008.  The company has no paid up share 
capital.  The Hong Kong Companies Registry lists Ji, Fang (likely a 
mainland national), as director but does not include a passport 
number or other identification. 
 
¶4.  According to the company's web site (www.Sunflyele.com), Sunfly 
is an independent distributor of electronic components. 
 
¶5.  Commercial Assistant, Carrie Chan, attempted for some time to 
arrange a meeting with the company.  A person identifying herself 
only as Catrina (the contact person on the underlying invoices) 
provided multiple reasons why she and the company's director could 
not come to Hong Kong to meet.  In particular, she stated that the 
company is registered in Hong Kong but has its operations in 
Shenzhen.  She further stated that neither she nor the company's 
director had permits to enter Hong Kong and this would take some 
time to obtain.  Later, Catrina stated that her director had the flu 
and was under observation at the hospital.  Given the time that has 
passed and the delay in arranging this EUC, ECO does not believe 
that the company is willing to meet. If that changes, ECO will 
update this cable. 
 
¶6.  Catrina did provide documentation by fax confirming that the 
items had been received by Sunfly.  She stated that the items were 
for stock and, as a result, Sunfly did not have any customer 
purchase order to share.  ECO views it as unlikely that Sunfly 
ordered such a large number of these items for stock and has 
apparently not yet sold any of them. 
 
¶7.  Based on the information noted above, ECO believes that Sunfly 
most likely does not have any permanent Hong Kong presence and uses 
its Hong Kong address to receive shipments and correspond with 
international clients and suppliers.  While there is no apparent 
export control violation associated with this shipment, ECO 
nonetheless does not believe Sunfly to be a suitable recipient of 
controlled U.S. origin technology.
