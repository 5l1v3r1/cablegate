LUTHER KING, JR. 
 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  A large group of Indonesian activists, 
labor leaders, scholars and students gathered at Pol/C's 
residence on January 22 to commemorate the life and legacy of 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  They watched a short film about 
Dr. King and the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, and listened to 
personal stories from Americans and an Indonesian speaker 
about Dr. King's influence on each of their lives.  Activists 
and students asked many questions about Dr. King, linking his 
legacy to the struggle for justice and human rights around 
the world.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) On January 22, Mission hosted at San Francisco House, 
Pol/C's residence, approximately 65 Indonesian civil society, 
religious and labor leaders, academics and students for a 
discussion focused on the life and legacy of Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr.  The event was held in honor of Dr. King and 
what would have been his 78th birthday on January 15.  The 
Ambassador, USAID Director, U.S. Library of Congress 
Director, DOJ/ICITAP Director, and other emboffs and FSN's 
also participated in the event.  The students--about a third 
of whom were women--were drawn from: The University of 
Indonesia; Muhammadiyah University; and, Atma Jaya 
University.  (Note:  Muhammadiyah is the second-largest 
Muslim organization in Indonesia with a following of over 30 
million.  Atma Jaya is a Catholic university.) 
 
¶3.  (U) Pol/C kicked off the event, underscoring that Dr. 
King was not only a great American but a great world leader 
who still speaks to us across all boundaries today.  He also 
read President Bush's recent statement on the life of Dr. 
King.  Pol/C introduced a short film on Dr. King and the U.S. 
Civil Rights Movement.  The film--produced by PAS--outlined 
the severity of segregation under Jim Crow, the sparking of 
the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. King's support for 
non-violence and his inspirational advocacy. 
 
¶4.  (U) Against this backdrop, one Indonesian and three 
Americans shared their personal experiences of Dr. King's 
leadership.  Well-known Indonesian academic and intercultural 
exchange leader Irid Agoes underlined the qualities of 
integrity and compassion that Dr. King embodied, noting that 
his convictions about freedom for all people had parallels in 
the Indonesian struggle for independence.  Agoes stressed the 
continuing relevance of Dr. King's message of tolerance and 
pluralism, and the need for Indonesians and all global 
citizens to respect differences. 
 
¶5.  (U) USAID Program Officer talked about how Dr. King 
inspired her life growing up and gave her courage to fight 
discrimination.  DOJ/ICITAP Director discussed how Dr. King 
and the spirit of the Civil Rights Movement inspired him to 
dedicate his life to public service.  (Note:  DOJ/ICITAP 
Director was a recipient of the Dr. King "Living the Dream" 
award for his achievements in police-community relations as a 
police officer in Arizona.) 
 
¶6.  (U) Ambassador Hume related his experience as a teenager 
traveling to join the 1963 March on Washington and listening 
in the audience on the Mall to Dr. King's "I have a Dream" 
speech.  Of Dr. King's importance, Ambassador Hume said: 
"Dr. King was a great man.  In the lifetime of anyone here, 
his leadership was the most important thing that happened to 
the U.S. since the end of the Second World War.  He changed 
not only what it meant to be a citizen, but what it meant to 
be a person." 
 
¶7.  (U) The discussion segment of the event was lively, with 
students, activists and academics asking many questions about 
the U.S. civil rights situation today and reflecting on 
Indonesia's own human rights situation.  Students said that 
prior to the program they had only a vague concept of Dr. 
King and his contributions, but that the event had educated 
them on the meaning of his life and its international 
implications.
