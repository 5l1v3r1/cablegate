SUBJECT: RECOGNITION OF OUTSTANDING SUPPORT OF BLUE 
LANTERN PROGRAM: DUNCAN WALKER 
 
¶1. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the 
outstanding performance of political officer Duncan Walker in 
supporting the Blue Lantern program.  As you know, Blue 
Lantern is the Department's primary instrument for monitoring 
the end-use of exported defense articles, technology, and 
services.  This program is indispensable to PM's Directorate 
of Defense Trade Controls in making informed licensing 
decisions, discovering illicit supply networks, and deterring 
diversions of U.S. military articles and technology. 
 
¶2. Mr. Walker demonstrated exemplary initiative in organizing 
and executing a very successful Blue Lantern outreach visit 
to Warsaw in September 2008, which included an on-site Blue 
Lantern check and served to strengthen our bilateral defense 
trade relationship with Poland. 
 
¶3. The PM Bureau and the Department are grateful for the 
efforts of Mr. Walker, which have demonstrably contributed to 
the security and integrity of U.S. defense trade. 
CLINTON
