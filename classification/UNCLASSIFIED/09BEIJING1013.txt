North Korea Reaction to UN Security Statement 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. China has "taken note" of reports that International Atomic 
Energy Agency inspectors have been expelled from North Korea, said 
spokesperson Jiang Yu at the April 16 regularly scheduled MFA press 
briefing.  China hopes that "all relevant parties will proceed from 
overall interests and show restraint to jointly safeguard the 
Six-Party Talks."  Promoting the denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula is "the consensus of all parties" and China is "willing to 
stay in contact with relevant parties."  China also hopes that 
countries will "work together to promote the peace and stability" of 
the region. 
 
Holbrooke Visit 
--------------- 
 
¶3. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard 
Holbrooke "exchanged views on issues of common interest including 
South Asia" during meetings with Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and 
State Councilor Dai Bingguo.  The two sides agreed to "increase 
cooperation" in the region. 
 
South China Sea 
--------------- 
 
¶4. The spokesperson had "no information" on reports that China is 
increasing its patrols of its exclusive economic zone in the South 
China Sea.  Jiang did say, however, that it is "completely lawful" 
for China to "conduct law enforcement activities" in its exclusive 
economic zone. 
 
Currency and U.S. Debt 
---------------------- 
 
¶5. China has "taken note" of the United States' declining to name 
China as a currency manipulator.  China will "push forward Renminbi 
exchange rate mechanism reform" in order to "maintain stability" of 
the currency.  This plan is "not only good for China but also good 
for the world economy."  Asked about China's holding of U.S. 
Treasury Bonds, Jiang said that China seeks to maintain value and 
liquidity in its investments. 
 
Train Quarantine 
---------------- 
 
¶6. China "takes seriously" reports of Russian train passengers being 
quarantined due to the death of a Chinese woman passenger.  China 
will "make further investigations into the matter."  Asked whether 
China would conduct health checks on citizens leaving the country, 
Jiang said that it is the responsibility of the country being 
entered to conduct the checks. 
 
Visits 
------ 
 
¶7. Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi will travel to Egypt, Israel and the 
Palestinian Territories, Syria and Russia from April 21 to April 27 
to "exchange views on bilateral and regional issues."
