REF: STATE 219001 
 
¶1. RSO has explored the utility of establishing an 
Investigative Counter-Terrorism Training and Advisor Program 
(ITP) in Sanaa and recommended to the AMB, DCM and Country 
Team that post not pursue the program, at this time. 
 
¶2. ATA and RSO Sanaa have offered training courses to the 
host government since 2000 and have noted a pattern of not 
sustaining course precepts after training.  The ROYG, at 
present, is not prepared to sponsor a program of this 
magnitude and maintain follow-on integrity of any office set 
up as a result of the program.  As well, RSO would not want 
to use valuable ATA resources to support the two courses as 
stand alone events. 
 
¶3. RSO is drafting, in a SepTel, an ATA assessment cable for 
the next two fiscal years.  RSO will focus less on courses 
that require officers to stay as an integral unit, instead, 
will focus more on courses designed to teach command and 
control structure, airport security, fraudulent travel 
documents and crisis response. 
 
¶4. RSO work with the host government for the next year and 
try to prepare their senior leadership for sponsorship of a 
program of this intensity. RSO intends to re-visit the ITP 
program offer when the ROYG is fully prepared to support and 
sustain the program. 
 
¶5. Post appreciates S/CT and ATA's consideration of post for 
this new initiative and requests the option of being able to 
re-visit a course offering in the future.
