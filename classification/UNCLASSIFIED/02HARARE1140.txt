SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT MUGABE'S VISIT TO THE UN 
 
 
¶1.   Under the headline "'Smart sanctions fail': Ban 
   imposed on Zimbabwe's leadership has failed to work: 
   Mudenge," the government-owned daily "Herald" offers the 
   official view of President Mugabe's May 8-12 visit to UN 
   headquarters in New York.  Excerpts: 
 
¶2.   "President Mugabe's visit to the UN in New York last 
   week means that the so-called smart sanctions imposed on 
   Zimbabwe's leadership have failed to work, the Minister 
   of Foreign Affairs Stan Mudenge, said yesterday. . . 
   The U.S. and the EU imposed the so-called targeted 
   sanctions, which are supposed to ban President Mugabe 
   and his entire Cabinet from visiting the U.S. and EU 
   member countries.  Yet the President and the First Lady; 
   as well as the Minister of Youth Development, Gender and 
   Employment Creation, Elliot Manyika, spent close to a 
   week in New York and their movements were not restricted 
   at all.  A spokesman for Zimbabwe's Permanent Mission to 
   the UN, Mr. Emmanuel Gumbo, dismissed media reports that 
   Mugabe's movements were restricted as mischievous.  He 
   said the President had '25 green lights ahead of him to 
   travel anywhere he wishes in the United States. . . .'"
