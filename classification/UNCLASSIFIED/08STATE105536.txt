SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - SUDAN 
 
¶1.  This Travel Warning updates U.S. citizens to 
security concerns in Sudan.  The Department of State 
continues to warn against all travel to Sudan due to the 
threats from armed conflicts and from terrorism. 
American citizens who choose to remain in Sudan should 
review their security posture, and take appropriate 
precautions in light of the January 2008 murder of two 
American Embassy employees and ongoing violence in many 
regions of the country.  This supersedes the Travel 
Warning for Sudan issued on March 14, 2008. 
¶2.  On January 1, 2008, two American Embassy employees 
were assassinated while traveling in their vehicle in 
Khartoum.  In May 2008, the city of Omdurman, adjacent 
to Khartoum, was attacked by armed militias.  The 
Embassy has implemented heightened security measures to 
protect Embassy personnel when traveling in Sudan, which 
include obtaining advance permission for all travel and 
modes of transportation to be used.  American citizens 
residing in Sudan are urged to carefully review and 
assess their safety and security situations, take 
appropriate security precautions, and to practice 
situational awareness at all times to ensure personal 
safety. 
¶3.  The Department of State continues to warn U.S. 
citizens against all travel to Sudan, particularly in 
the Darfur area, where violence between government 
forces and various armed militias continues.  Americans 
and other westerners have been victims of carjacking and 
armed robbery while traveling in Sudan.  Land travel at 
night should be avoided. 
¶4.  Travelers are reminded that the U.S. Government has 
received indications of terrorist threats aimed at 
American and western interests in Sudan.  Terrorist 
actions may include suicide operations, bombings, or 
kidnappings.  U.S. citizens should be aware of the risk 
of indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets in public 
places, which include tourist sites and locations where 
westerners are known to congregate, and commercial 
operations associated with U.S. or western interests. 
Anti-western demonstrations periodically occur, mostly 
in the capital city of Khartoum. 
 
¶5.  Travel anywhere in Sudan, including Khartoum and the 
adjacent town of Omdurman, is potentially dangerous. 
Sporadic violence instigated by militias has occurred in 
South Sudan.  Militia forces have also attacked 
locations in the south. Threats have been made against 
foreigners working in the oil industry in Upper Nile 
state. 
¶6.  Enforcement of aviation safety standards in Sudan is 
uneven; civil aviation in Sudan continues to experience 
air incidents and accidents, including five crashes with 
at least 64 fatalities between November 8, 2007, and 
September 21, 2008. Incidents included engine failures, 
collapsed landing gear, and planes veering off the 
runway.  In August, 2008, a domestic plane originating 
in Nyala, Darfur was hijacked and forced to land in 
Libya.  Whenever possible, Americans traveling to Sudan 
despite the ongoing travel warning are advised to travel 
directly to their destinations on international carriers 
from countries whose civil aviation authorities meet 
international aviation safety standards for the 
oversight of their air carrier operations under the 
FAA's International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) 
program. 
 
¶7.  Americans who travel to Sudan despite this Travel 
Warning must possess a valid passport with at least six 
months of validity and a Sudanese visa.  Travelers must 
apply for a visa in their own country of residence.  In 
August 2006, five foreigners, including two Americans, 
 
STATE 00105536  002 OF 002 
 
 
were arrested and detained in Darfur after entering 
Sudan via the Chadian border town of Banal without the 
appropriate documentation.  Several of these individuals 
had solicited and obtained escorts in Chad who allegedly 
promised to facilitate entry into Sudan but who were 
ultimately unable to follow through with their 
commitments.  Without appropriate travel documents and 
permits, travelers may face arrest and detention for 
crimes including illegal entry, publication of false 
information, and espionage.  If convicted, sentences 
range from deportation to life in prison or the death 
penalty. 
 
¶8.  The Sudanese Government requires that anyone seeking 
to travel outside a 25 kilometer radius of Khartoum 
obtain a special travel permit.  The Government has 
placed additional permit requirements for travel to 
Darfur.  This includes humanitarian workers, 
journalists, photographers, and other media employees. 
Separate additional permits are required to take 
photographs, even for private use, and to conduct 
journalism anywhere in Sudan.  Additional information 
about entry requirements for Sudan and other countries 
is located on the State Department's Bureau of Consular 
Affairs web site at http://travel.state.gov 
¶9.  U.S. citizens are strongly urged to register with 
the Embassy in Khartoum or through the State 
Department's Travel Registration website, 
https://travelregistration.state.gov.  By registering, 
American citizens make it easier for the Embassy to 
contact them in case of emergency.  The U.S. Embassy is 
located at Sharia Ali Abdul Latif, Khartoum; tel. (249- 
183) 774-701/2/3 (outside Sudan); tel. (0183) 774- 
701/2/3 (inside Sudan.)  For after-hours emergencies, 
please call 249-183-774-700 and ask to be connected to 
the Duty Officer. 
 
¶10.  Minimize considered.
