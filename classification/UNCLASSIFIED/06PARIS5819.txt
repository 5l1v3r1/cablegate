Washington, DC 20520 
 
Dear Madame Secretary: 
 
Thank you very much for taking time out of your busy day to write to 
me this very thoughtful letter. I enjoyed reading it. 
 
Your enthusiasm for my recovery and for the independence of my 
country has touched me.  And I'm truly confident that one day with 
the help of God and that of your country we will gain our nation's 
liberty and freedom again. 
 
The Women's Media Foundation would like to award me with the 2006 
Courage in Journalism Award.  This would require me to be in the US 
for approximately two weeks between October 18 and November 3.  This 
event will take place in New York, Washington, DC, and Los Angeles. 
So it will be an honor and I would greatly appreciate the chance to 
meet you then. 
 
It would be an honor for me to make a special documentary about you 
for my new program "Opinion Leaders." 
 
In closing, I would like to thank you again for your interest and 
for your touching letter. 
 
I hope to hear from you soon. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
/s/ 
 
May Chidiac 
 
Oliver
