LTD. 
 
REF: A) USDOC 03132 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) attempted 
to conduct post shipment-verifications (PSV) at Windway Technologies 
(AKA Shenzen Windway Technologies) and Semitek Electronics Ltd. both 
located at Rooms 1102-1102, Kowloon Building, 555 Nathan Road, 
Kowloon, Hong Kong (Windway/Semitek). The item in question for the 
Windway shipment is digital signal processing hardware exported to 
Windway on or about October 11, 2007 and valued at USD 4,975. Items 
shipped to Semitek on October 26, 2007 include aircraft parts.  On 
the applicable shippers export declarations (SEDs), these items are 
classified under export control classification number (ECCN) 3A992 
and 7A994 respectively and, if properly classified, would be 
controlled for anti-terrorism (AT) reasons.  The exporter was EWA 
Technologies, Inc. of Mount Laurel, New Jersey (for the hardware) 
and Fatair of City of Industry, California. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Windway has been 
in existence since 2003.  Its paid up share capital is the Hong Kong 
equivalent of USD 1,300.  Mainland China national Kuang, 
Zaihua(mainland Passport number: G01792710) is listed as the sole 
director.  This individual is not a director in any other Hong Kong 
company although a review of the Shenzhen, mainland China companies 
registry web site (at the Shenzhen Industrial and Commercial 
Administration Bureau) lists a Shenzhen company Windway (with Kuang, 
Zaihua as director).  Compak Secretaries Limited is listed as the 
company's corporate secretary in Hong Kong and Windway's corporate 
address is the same as the address of Compak.  Compak has multiple 
office locations (www.compak.com.hk) including an additional office 
on the 14th floor of the Kowloon building. 
 
¶4.  Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan attempted for some time to 
arrange a time to conduct the PSV.  A representative of Compak 
answered the Hong Kong number provided for Windway.  That person 
provided a mainland China phone number for the company but refused 
to pass a message to Windway in the mainland.  The ECO does not 
contact companies in mainland China consistent with limitations on 
the scope of operations of the ECO in Hong Kong.  ECO sent a 
registered letter to Windway requesting a meeting.  A representative 
of Compak accepted that letter on Windway's behalf but, to date, no 
contact has been made by representatives of Windway.  ECO does not 
expect Windway to be in touch. 
 
¶5.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Semitek was 
incorporated in 2002 and has the Hong Kong equivalent of USD 1300 in 
share capital.  Its directors are listed as Chinese mainland 
nationals He, Dong Sheng (Passport number G02704343) and Wang, You 
Jun (Passport number 145744147).  Neither individual is listed as a 
director in any other Hong Kong company.  Semitek's corporate 
secretary is listed as United Incorporations Limited, also listed as 
being located at the same address.  United Incorporations Limited 
has a range of international offices 
(www.ukinc.org/contact/default.html).  According to Semitek's web 
site, it is engaged in the RF & Microwave high-tech market in China 
(www.semitekcn.com). 
 
¶6.  As in the case of Windway, a representative of Compak answered 
the phone number provided for Semitek.  The Compak representative 
declined to forward a message to Semitek representatives in the 
mainland but stated that it would forward a letter.  ECO sent a 
registered letter requesting a meeting to Semitek that was received 
(and the receipt marked with what appears to be the Semitek seal). 
ECO has received no reply from Semitek and does not expect to 
receive one. 
 
¶7.  Windway and Semitek are unsuitable recipients of U.S. origin 
 
technology as they do not appear to have a physical presence in Hong 
Kong and did not agree to accept PSVs. ECO recommends that Windway 
and Semitek be added to the BIS Unverified List.  At OEA's 
direction, ECO may request that the Hong Kong government assist the 
ECO in making contact with these companies.
