PROJECT 
 
Ref: (A) TELCON OF 12/12/06; (B) TELCON OF 01/03/07 
 
¶1.  At a December 8, 2006, meeting at Brazil's Ministry of the 
Environment, ESTH Counselor Patricia Norman, Science Officer KG 
Moore and EPA Project Leader Dr. Luis Fernandez met with Dr. Marilia 
Cerqueira, Director of Brazil's Mercury programs.  Dr. Fernandez 
presented to the Brazilians the scope and proposed planned 
activities for the Mercury Reduction in Artisanal Mining Project. 
 
¶2.  Background Note:  Brazil is the leading producer of gold ore in 
Latin America, the majority of which is produced using a mercury 
amalgamation process that results in an estimated 130 tonnes of 
mercury released into the environment annually.  EPA is seeking, in 
partnership with Brazil's Ministry of the Environment, CETEM and 
UNIDO, to develop a pilot project to encourage the use of mercury 
reduction technologies among artisanal gold miners and gold shops. 
End of Note. 
 
¶3.  This project had been the topic of earlier meetings at the 
Ministry.  The issue of whether a MOU or other type of instrument 
would be required to govern this activity had been raised 
intermittently by the Brazilians.  At the December 8 meeting, 
Marilia Cerqueira made a plea for some kind of instrument to "bless" 
this activity.  Cerqueira said the Ministry felt uncomfortable 
working without the endorsement of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. 
 
 
¶4.  Post suggested the possibility of exchanging letters of 
cooperation, under the authority of the Common Agenda for the 
Environment.  The letters of cooperation could be signed by both the 
U.S. and Brazilian foreign ministries granting authority to the 
Brazilian Ministry of the Environment and EPA to execute the Mercury 
Reduction in Artisanal Mining Project as mutually agreed.  (A 
speedier alternative, if acceptable to the Brazilians, would be to 
have letters signed only by EPA and the Brazilian Ministry of the 
Environment.) Cerqueira agreed to consider the exchange of letters. 
 
 
¶5.  An electronic version of the Common Agenda for The Environment 
agreement, signed by the United States and Brazil in 1995 will be 
sent to OES/ENV and EPA via email. 
 
¶6.  Post seeks OES/ENV and EPA perspectives as to whether the 
exchange of letters of cooperation could be an acceptable 
alternative to the Ministry's request for a MOU.  If this is a 
viable alternative, Post would request OES/EPA develop draft text.
