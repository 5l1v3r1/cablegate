SUBJECT:  TERRORISM FINANCE: DOMESTIC DESIGNATION OF FOUR 
INDIVIDUALS AND ONE ENTITY UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 13438 
 
REF: 08 STATE 03749 
 
¶1.  Per ref A, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) 
issued a formal instruction on February 2, 2008, providing all 
banking institutions with information on four individuals (including 
Ahmed Foruzandeh) and one entity (Al Zawra Television Station) 
designated by the U.S. Department of Treasury pursuant to U.S. 
E.O.13438 on November 9, 2008. 
 
¶2.  The FSC asked banking institutions in Taiwan to strengthen 
monitoring over transactions with the designated individuals which 
will arise because the U.S. has prohibited the U.S. banking sector 
from engaging in transactions with these individuals and the entity. 
 The FSC required them to treat transactions with the designated 
individuals/entity and their beneficiaries as suspected money 
laundering transactions, and instantly report these transactions to 
the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau for further 
investigation and action. 
 
¶3.  The FSC also asked the following industry associations to 
request their members to comply with the February 12, 2008 
instructions: 
--Credit Cooperation Association 
--Bills Finance Association 
--Securities Firms Association 
--Securities Investment Trust and Consultant Association 
--Futures Commissioners Association 
--Life Insurance Association 
--Non-life Insurance Association 
--all jewelry associations
