(11/14) 
¶1.  Summary:  Syrian papers today (Nov. 14) reported that President 
Abdullah Wad of Senegal received an oral message from President Asad 
 
on bilateral relations and regional and international developments. 
The message was conveyed by Minister of Information Dr. Mohsen 
Bilal.  The Senegalese president described Syria's role in 
establishing peace in the Middle East as "important and active." 
President Wad expressed gratitude to Syria's President and people 
for the assistance given to the Senegalese community during the 
recent Israeli aggression on Lebanon. 
Papers also reported Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Miqdad's visit 
to Oman carrying a message from President Asad to Sultan Qaboos on 
Arab coordination on developments in Iraq and Palestine. 
Papers also reported a meeting by the Central Command of the 
National Progressive Front which was briefed by Vice-President Shara 
on Arab, regional and international situations.  The Central Command 
strongly accused some Lebanese parties of being affiliated with 
foreign powers to facilitate imposing their hegemony on Lebanon and 
isolating and marginalizing Lebanon's active popular and political 
powers.  It also praised the Palestinian consensus on forming a 
national unity government, describing it as "a right step towards 
enhancing the internal front and foiling attempts to incite civil 
strife and sedition."  The Central Command also emphasized that US 
forces are facing a serious dilemma in Iraq, which will oblige the 
US to reconsider its strategy, adding that the mid-term elections in 
the U.S. revealed a drastic shift in US public opinion regarding the 
Iraq war. 
End of summary.

Al-Thawra, wrote (11/14):  "The United States, through its veto 
against a draft UNSC resolution condemning Israel, showed itself a 
partner in the massacre that Israel committed in Bait Hanoun.... 
Through this unjust position, the US Administration violates the 
most fundamental rules of justice and logic, places itself in the 
position of open hostility toward Arabs.... It turns its back on 
international will and unanimity in condemning the aggression and

"The Bush administration is facing serious problems in its 
preemptive war policy and its semi-total submission to the extremist 
ideas and visions offered by figures and study centers that are 
fully committed to Israel's positions on the issues of the region. 
"Removing Donald Rumsfeld from the Defense Department will not solve 
the problem of the US Administration in Iraq and the Arab region in 
general, because 'Israel's gang' in American decision-making 
centers, which was the ideological and strategic driving force 
behind the occupation of Iraq and which sees Iraq as the base for 
movement toward 'redrawing the map of the entire region' and 
establishing the so-called New Middle East, will not stop 
'inventing' ideas and finding strategic and tactical alternatives to 
serve the Zionist entity under the guise of serving the higher 
national interests of the United States....

"Will the failure in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Lebanon, and the 
Democratic control of the House of Representatives and Senate, serve 
as a reason and opportunity for comprehensive revision of, and the 
return of rationalism and balance to, US foreign policy? Or will the 
administration of President Bush remain hostage to the plans and 
scenarios of the neoconservatives, the supporters of Israel, and the 
theorists of 'creative instability'?  And will the administration, 
consequently, become more deeply enmeshed in the labyrinths of 
metaphysical visions and the illusions of imperial hegemony at the 
expense of stability, security, and a peace based on interests, 
mutual respect, and the right of nations to adhere to their own 
options and national and cultural identities, especially their 
legitimate right to resist invaders and colonialists and reject the 
logic of foreign dictates, the language of force, and the ideology

Israel?  Or will Olmert's visit merely be an attempt to escape from

intensifying settlement activity, annexing more Palestinian lands, 
and imposing Israeli diktats?"
