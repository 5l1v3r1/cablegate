SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT PAPER CONDEMNS MEDIA BILL; HARARE 
 
 
¶1.   UNDER HEADLINE "THE BILL THAT THREATENS ACCESS TO 
    DEMOCRACY" THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" DEDICATED 
    ITS JANUARY 29 EDITORIAL TO CONDEMNING THE CONTROVERSIAL 
    ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND PROTECTION OF PRIVACY BILL AS A 
    THREAT TO DEMOCRACY.  EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   "FEW BILLS HAVE CAUSED AS MUCH POLARIZATION IN ZANU PF 
    AS THE CONTROVERSIAL, STALINIST AND MISNAMED ACCESS TO 
    INFORMATION AND PROTECTION OF PRIVACY BILL.  THE TITLE 
    OF THE BILL OUGHT TO HAVE EMPHASIZED ITS PRIMARY 
    OBJECTIVE - TO SILENCE THE INDEPENDENT OR PRIVATELY- 
    OWNED MEDIA. . .WHEN PARLIAMENT RESUMES ITS DEBATE OF 
    THE BILL, IT MUST BE THE HOPE OF ALL FREEDOM-LOVING AND 
    FREE-THINKING PEOPLE THAT IT WILL EITHER BE THROWN OUT 
    OR WATERED DOWN TO CONFORM WITH THE HOPES OF AN 
    ELECTORATE KEEN TO ACHIEVE REAL POLITICAL PLURALISM. 
    IN A REAL DEMOCRACY, NO LAW CIRCUMSCRIBING THE FREEDOM 
    OF THE PRESS CAN BE SEEN AS A DESIRABLE COMPONENT OF 
    THE OPENING-UP OF THE HORIZONS OF FREEDOM FOR THE 
    PEOPLE. . . ."
