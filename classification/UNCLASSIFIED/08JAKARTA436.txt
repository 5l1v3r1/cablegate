¶1.  Air Vice Marshal Sunaryo of the Indonesian Air Force (IAF) 
office of Material Maintenance and Supply Command told us on 
February 4, 2008 that IAF received the air data amplifier for its 
C130 aircraft detailed in reftel and confirmed that the spare parts 
are used for the purpose stated on the license.  According to 
Sunaryo, Singapore Technologies Aerospace (ST Aerospace) is IAF's 
main source for U.S. Austin Aerotech products.  ST Aerospace 
provides maintenance service and acts as a parts purchaser for the 
Indonesian Department of Defense.  Sunaryo also noted that ST 
Aerospace was aware of the restrictions on USML. 
 
¶2. We contacted the IAF office of Aeronautics Service on February 
12, 2008 to verify items related to a different license, but with 
the same end-user and same foreign consignees received by post via 
separate email.  The items are 4 P/N: 622-4394-013 Air Data Control, 
4 P/N: 622-4393-002 Air Data Control, and 4 P/N: 777-1406-056 Yaw 
Damper Computer.  The Aeronautics Service staff told us that IAF did 
not receive nor place an order to procure these items for ST 
Aerospace.  The staff also added that the license numbers 4 P/N: 
622-4394-013 and 4 P/N: 622-4393-002 refer to C-130 aircraft radar 
equipment, not air data control.  On February 12, 2008, we spoke 
with Ferdy W of Ferco-Genesa, the Indonesian local agent for ST 
Aerospace.  He said that the company had no information about this 
order.
