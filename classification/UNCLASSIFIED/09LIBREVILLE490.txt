Â¶1. On November 4, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director 
General of the Americas Desk Bika Bisso told poloff that 
Gabon may decide to abstain from voting on the Goldstone 
Report.  Bika Bisso said that he could not give a definitive 
answer, but that Gabon had abstained in the past on similar 
measures and that Gabon does not have the same "anti-Israel 
agenda" other members of the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference hold.  Poloff urged Bika Bisso to express the 
U.S.'s desire for at least an abstention to the rest of the 
Gabonese Government.
