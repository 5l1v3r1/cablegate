attention to the negative repercussions of such intervention on 
stability and security in the region. 
The two sides reiterated their support for the current political 
process in the region, stressing the need to achieve security, 
stability and national reconciliation among all the Iraqi people, 
welcoming in this context all the efforts exerted by the United 
Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, Iraq's 
neighboring states and the Arab Initiative for National 
Reconciliation.

assembly and an Iraqi government in which all the Iraqi factions

Asad confirmed Syria's commitment to cooperate with UN 
investigators but not at the expense of its national sovereignty. 
 
President Asad vowed to speed up reforms aimed at introducing 
more political freedom and a measure of democracy to Syria, but 
said he would resist foreign pressure for change. 
 
"We are still at the beginning of a long road, but we will not 
let it be said that we have achieved nothing. Maybe the [pace] is 
slow ... but we are speeding as much as possible." 
 
"We are undertaking several projects that will boost public 
participation and help enrich democratic life, whether it be 
linked to the parties law or to election and local government 
laws," Asad said.

An unsigned editorial in government-owned Al-Ba'th, said (1/20): 
"Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinjad's visit to Damascus and the 
discussions he held with President Asad have a special 
significance.... 
"The hostile attack to which the two countries in particular and 
the Middle East region in general are being subjected has 
extended to its maximum possible limits and is taking the 
fiercest and most vicious forms ever. The United States, its 
subordinates and allies have taken off their masks and breached 
all values and principles in their rabid endeavor to impose their

hegemony upon the region...to redraw the Middle East map and 
reshape its states and existing regimes.... 
"The United States has employed different methods and pretexts in 
dealing with both countries. In Syria's case, it has employed 
false claims about Syria's failure to control its border with 
Iraq and has tried to implicate it in the Al-Hariri 
assassination. As for Iran, the United States has made claims 
about Iran's alleged endeavor to produce nuclear arms and support 
terrorism. Despite all that, the US aims have become clear to the 
public, that is, encircling Syria and Iran and leaving them with 
two options. The first is to give in and do whatever they are 
required to do, that is, surrender unconditionally and without 
limitation, as a preliminary step toward joining the so- 
called 'Greater Middle East' US plan. The second option is to 
face the application of the Iraqi model to Syria and Iran, that 
is, the imposition of siege, boycott and sanctions. 
"Syria's response was similar to that of Iran, namely, 
emphasizing its determination, despite all that this option 
entails in the present regional and international reality, to 
withstand difficulties, sacrifice and detriment. The choice to 
resist has emerged from the fact that both countries have not 
violated any international law or human code, have not defied any 
of the principles that regulate international relations, and have 
not breached UN resolutions or its charter...."

(1/21): "The United States does not have any proof that Syria is 
interfering in Lebanese, Iraqi, or Palestinian affairs.... 
"If Syria, as they claim, interferes in the affairs of 
neighboring Arab countries, is the occupation of Iraq not 
interference in the affairs of another country? Isn't US 
Assistant Secretary of State David Welch's statement, that 
Hizbollah is a terrorist organization that must not be included 
in the government, interference in Lebanon's domestic affairs? 
"The United States rejects Hizbollah's presence in the Lebanese 
government and rejects HAMAS' representation in the Palestinian 
government after the forthcoming elections. Is this the promised 
democracy that they want to impose on the Arabs by force? 
"The United States is building its policy on lies.... The US 
Administration must acknowledge its mistakes before people's 
hatred of the American policies turns into hatred of the United 
States."

"Superpowers Brandish Nuclear Deterrence"

Hanan Hamad, a commentator in government-owned Tishreen, wrote 
(1/21): "French President Chirac took the concept of nuclear 
deterrence to a new and more dangerous level when he threatened 
to use nuclear weapons against any country launching a terror 
attack on French territory or against its allies, or their 
interests.... 
"The US Administration has been studying the possibility of using 
nuclear weapons against adversaries, even in preemptive 
strikes.... Chirac's statements give Washington the green light 
to implement its new nuclear strategy...."
