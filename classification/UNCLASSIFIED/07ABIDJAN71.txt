SUBJECT: PUBLIC PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS' STRIKE ENDS 
 
REF: ABIDJAN 1314 
 
¶1.  Primary schools in Cote d'Ivoire reopened on January 4, 
2007, ending a six-week strike by primary school teachers 
(reftel).  The teachers agreed to resume work after accepting 
an offer by the Government of Cote d'Ivoire (GOCI) of CFA 
30,000 (USD 60) per month to increase housing allowances 
starting in March 2007.  When they launched the strike, the 
teachers had initially demanded a housing allowance of CFA 
40,000 (USD 80) per month. 
 
¶2.  The teacher's acceptance of the GOCI's offer was 
conditional.  They agreed to accept CFA 30,000 (USD 60) only 
for twelve months from March 2007 to March 2008.  After that, 
they are demanding that the figure rise to CFA 40,000 per 
month, and that the GOCI pay back the "aggregated arrears" of 
CFA 120,000, (CFA 10,000 each month) owed to each teacher 
from the initial twelve-month period. 
 
¶3.  Comment:  While the GOCI and teachers have yet to work 
out some pay issues, we expect they will do so.  In the 
meantime, it is significant that a potentially destabilizing 
strike has been settled at a price that the government 
apparently feels it can afford.  End Comment.
