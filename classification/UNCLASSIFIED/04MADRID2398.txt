REF: SECSTATE 135301 
 
¶1.  We shared reftel points with Ana Paredes, MFA Subdirector 
General for International Technical Organizations and Amparo 
Ramblas, Deputy Director for International Relations, 
Ministry of Environment. 
 
¶2.  Paredes responded that she has not heard of any proposed 
plan that would require the UNEP to direct or oversee the 
work of autonomous bodies.  She added that France is 
proposing a world agency on the environment supported by 
Germany and opposed by Austria.  Paredes said that Spain 
takes a neutral posture on France's proposal. 
 
¶3.  Paredes requested that we send her a copy of the talking 
points so that she could consult appropriately with technical 
staff, which we declined to provide per reftel instructions 
(see comment). 
 
¶4.  Amparo Ramblas said that she would inform the appropriate 
Spanish mission of reftel points. 
 
¶5.  Comment:  Paredes said that she recently pressed for the 
GOS to adopt a USG position, only to learn from upset GOS 
officials upon their return from negotiations that the USG 
reversed its position without informing the GOS.  She is now 
reluctant to act upon a USG demarche without receiving a 
written request.  End Comment.
