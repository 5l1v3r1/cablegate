Embassy delivered ref A points to the Dutch Foreign Ministry. 
 On December 18, Minister for Development Cooperation 
Koenders issued a press release that he was suspending budget 
support to Nicaragua.  "I find it irresponsible to give 
direct help to the Sandinista government, which has thwarted 
free and fair elections in all possible manners."  (Note: 
Koenders had expressed concern to Nicaraguan Foreign Minister 
Santos in summer 2008 about the Supreme Electoral Council's 
decision to bar two opposition parties from participating in 
elections.  End Note.)  MFA Deputy for Central American 
Affairs Laetitia van Asch Pieters told poloff the suspension 
applied to 2009 budget support, in the amount 6 million euros 
(approx. $8.6 million).  Half of the Netherlands' 2008 budget 
support, also 6 million euros, had previously been canceled 
(ref B).  The Dutch ambassador in Managua has informed the 
Nicaraguan government of this latest decision.  Dutch foreign 
assistance for other activities -- including 12.5 million 
euros (approx. $17.8 million) for health, education and 
business improvement -- will continue.  Koenders has raised 
objections to the Nicaraguan government's ban on abortion on 
medical grounds; the Dutch government is, therefore, 
supporting programs on sexual and reproductive health rights 
as part of its health assistance.  Van Asch Pieters noted the 
EU has also canceled budgetary assistance to Nicaragua, and 
had so informed Nicaragua's vice minister for development 
cooperation on December 12.  She asked for further 
information on benchmarks the USG will use to resume aid (ref 
C).
