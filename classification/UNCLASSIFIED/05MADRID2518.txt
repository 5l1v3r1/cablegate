SUBJECT: SPAIN ON SECURITY SECTOR SUPPORT FOR THE

REF: SECSTATE 121751 
 
Poloff delivered reftel points on June 30 to MFA Office 
Director for the Middle East Alberto Moreno.  Moreno 
expressed appreciation for the USG message and said Spain 
concurred with the need for the international community to 
fulfill the security requirements of the Palestinian 
Authority.  To this end, he said, Spain has worked closely 
with U.S. Security Coordinator Ward through a Spanish Civil 
Guard officer assigned as a liaison to Ward.  Moreno said 
Spain was among the top three donors of security equipment, 
particularly in the form of vehicles for use by the 
Palestinian Authority.  He said Spain had encountered 
problems with the Israeli government with respect to body 
armor, which Spain wanted to provide to Palestian Authority 
security forces, but which the Israeli government feared 
could be transferred to terrorists.  Moreno said, however, 
that Spain is generally satisfied with its level of 
participation and believes the Ward Mission to be among the 
most necessary and important initiatives currently being 
undertaken to support peace in the region.
