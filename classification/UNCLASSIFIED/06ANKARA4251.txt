In Today's Papers 
 
US General Meets with Barzani in Sulaymaniye, PKK Activity 
(Hurriyet, Radikal, Zaman):  George Casey, the US general 
responsible for the multinational forces in Iraq went to Iraq's 
Kurdish region to meet with President Barzani on Thursday. 
According to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan's (PUK) official 
website, General Casey and Barzani met in Sulaymaniye but the 
posting didn't give details of the meeting.  According to Zaman, 
General Casey met with Barzani to convey to him Turkish 
sensitivities about the PKK.  Meanwhile, by means of a diplomatic 
note, Turkey urged Baghdad yesterday to close a PKK-affiliated 
research center named after jailed terrorist leader Abdullah Ocalan. 
 Radikal reports that responding to a question about whether 
Washington could trust Turkey, State Department spokesman Sean 
McCormack said that 'Turkey is a good friend and ally.  Turkey and 
the US have the same concerns in the region.'  Sabah reports that 
PKK terrorists stopped around 200 vehicles on the Van-Hakkari 
highway yesterday, gathered all the passengers on the road side, 
checked IDs and after a short pro-PKK speech to the crowd allowed 
them back to their vehicles.  Sabah highlights the fact that such 
PKK activities took place in the past when the terrorist activities 
were at their highest levels in Turkey. 
 
Columnist Haluk Ulman argues that Turkey is facing a stalling tactic 
from the US regarding the fight against PKK presence in northern 
Iraq.  In the economic-political daily Dunya he writes: "A 
diplomatic solution is certainly the most preferable one and in fact 
even the worst diplomatic solution is better than a military option. 
 However when it comes to PKK terrorism in northern Iraq, it is 
really difficult to make a similar argument.  First of all, a 
diplomatic solution requires two sides discussing an issue. There is 
no 'side' in Iraq capable of working for a settlement via 
discussion.  Turkey is forced to think about taking care of the 
problem on its own.  The Bush administration answers with the 
'trilateral mechanism' whenever it feels pressured on this issue. 
Let's take a close look at who is who in this mechanism.  One side 
is coalition forces, i.e. the US, and the other is the government of 
Iraq which means the US again.  In other words, Turkey's counterpart 
on this issue is the US itself.  Proposing three party talks is 
nothing but nonsense.  Washington's problem stems from the fact that 
the US does not have control over Iraq, nor does its puppet Iraqi 
regime have authority even in the capital Baghdad.  Northern Iraq is 
fully controlled by Barzani who will not do anything to finish off 
the PKK's presence.  And the US is obviously not willing to lose 
Iraqi Kurds' support - the only support it gets in Iraq.  Given the 
facts, who will be the counter party to discuss the terrorism issue 
with Turkey?  The trilateral mechanism is only a pretext to stop 
Turkey's possible cross-border operatin." 
 
Israeli Bombings in Lebanon; Turkey Becoes Evacuation Center 
All papers: Papers focus on the developments in the situation in 
Lebanon while the headlines generally reflected reports about 
civilian deaths and humanitarian sufferings.  Radikal headlines 
"Devoid of Humanity," reporting that the death toll in Lebanon has 
surpassed 325 and "hunger has reared its head." Islamist-oriented 
Yeni Safak reports that the Israeli air attacks have turned Lebanese 
cities into "ghost towns," leaving "neighborhoods previously home to 
100,000 people empty." Mainstream Milliyet headlines, "In Beirut 
it's the Civilians Who Suffer," explaining that Israeli attacks 
though meant for Hezbollah have only hit homes and civilians while 
Hezbollah has announced "not one of us has died." Conservative 
Tercuman asked "how many more children should die in order to stop 
the war?"  All papers report that "for the first time in 23 years" 
US Marines are back in Lebanon," this time to help with the 
evacuation. 
 
Radikal reported that Turkey's southern port city Mersin has become 
one of the centers for the evacuation operation from Lebanon. 
Turkey's Red Crescent is actively involved in the evacuation efforts

and providing transportation and supplies.  The Turkish Foreign 
Ministry is going to evacuate 450 Turkish citizens from Beirut on 
Monday.  A group of foreigners continue to enter Turkey via ground 
from the Syrian border.  The USS Nashville will evacuate 1200 
American citizens from Beirut and bring them to Cyprus. 
 
According to columnist Hasan Cemal ongoing tension in the Middle 
East is going to negatively affect the global fight against 
terrorism.  In mainstream Milliyet he observed: "Radical Islamic 
fundamentalism was one of the main reasons for the start of Iraq war 
three years ago.  The neo-cons in the US strongly believed that 
global war against fundamentalist terror was a must.  Seeing the 
current picture in Iraq as well as in the Islamic world in a broader 
sense, we cannot claim that radical Islam has weakened and terrorism 
has declined.  We can't argue about the rise of democracy since the 
beginning of Iraq war either.   Instead what we see is the opening 
of Pandora's Box where all the evil has been unleashed.  It seems 
Washington neo-cons did not learn any lesson as they still suggest 
that the war should continue.  According to their argument, the 
fight with radical Islam requires a global war.  Thus the US wants 
to spread the war to Iran and Syria and is supportive of the Israeli 
attack in Lebanon.  I strongly believe in the need to fight against 
radical Islam but it should be made through the values of democracy, 
human rights and supremacy of law in the Islamic world.  This calls 
for regime changes in the Islamic world, not for a global war. 
Democracy and regime change require patience and time.  War is a 
destruction of humanity and it always has a backlash.  Why is it so 
hard to see this fact?" 
 
 
Council of State (Danistay) Lift Asset Freeze of Al-Kadi 
All papers:  The Council of State yesterday overturned a government 
order to freeze the assets of Yasin Al-Kadi, a suspected Al-Qaida 
financier who has close ties with Prime Minister Erdogan and AKP 
members.  The Council of State said in its decision that no 
documental evidence was provided following the Council of 
Ministerial decree to freeze the assets.  In the absence of a local 
court ruling and lack of documented proof against Al-Kadi, the 
Council of State said that temporary injunctions on foreign 
investors' assets require legl rulings rather than government 
orders.
