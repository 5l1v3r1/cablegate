¶A.  Site Assessment and Meetings During Recent Reporting 
Period 
 
1)  Jul 5 -   EXBS Advisor met with MFA Arms Control and 
Disarmament Head of Department Serhan Yigit to discuss 
current projects in Turkey, including Internal Control 
Program (ICP), Customs Training and Second Line of Defense 
(SLD). EXBS Advisor inquired as to the latest information 
concerning the NP Cooperation Agreement.  Yigit replied that 
he did not have any new information and has been instructed 
to wait until information was provided concerning the US 
status of the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy Agreement 
before making further inquires on this Agreement.  EXBS 
Advisor expressed concern about the linking of these two 
Agreement and the potential slow down of activities it could 
cause.  Yigit, stated he understood the potential 
ramifications but was given his instructions.  EXBS Advisor 
explored possibility of granting a ZBV van which was already 
in Turkey for use by Turkish Customs.  EXBS Advisor stated 
that this one time grant could be done outside the NP 
Cooperation Agreement, if both countries agreed.  Yigit 
thought this could be possible, however he would need to 
review the grant document with appropriate offices.  Yigit 
added that he was hopeful that we could continue to find ways 
to cooperate while we await these other formalities, although 
everything will be much easier once we can place all the NP 
programs into full motion, including the delivery of 
equipment and the starting of the SLD upgrades.  EXBS Advisor 
agreed and then reviewed the activities that had occurred and 
will occur between US and Turkish Customs, both training and 
visits. 
 
2)  Jul 9 - 17 - US Customs and Border Protection Service 
conducted a Targeting and Risk Management Workshop for 24 
Turkish Customs officials in Ankara from July 9 - 13, 2007.

through a land border crossing.  Members of Turkish Customs 
Headquarters along with representatives from key border 
locations were in attendance at the workshop.  The course 
included a day of practical exercises at the inland clearance 
station in Ankara.  Initial feedback from those in attendance 
was that the information was very useful and will be valuable 
as Turkish Customs continues to develop and improve its 
targeting and risk management procedures.  Following the 
one-week workshop, CBP instructors conducted 2 days of 
meetings and discussions with members of Turkish Customs 
Headquarters operations and targeters to further discuss 
Turkish processes and explore possible areas of future

team prior to their departure.  Guzel stated that he had 
received several positive reports from the officials who 
attended the workshop who all felt the information presented 
and discussed was very beneficial.  Guzel added that close 
cooperation between the US and Turkey would be beneficial in 
improving the Turkish system and for sharing experiences with 
US counterparts.  EXBS Advisor then informed Guzel of an 
upcoming visit by DOE SLD personnel and their desire to meet 
to discuss proposed plan to replace currently installed 
portal monitors with newer, more dependable equipment.  Guzel 
welcomed the opportunity to meet to discuss this project.

Director General Ihsan Kocer to review past events and 
upcoming cooperation activities and schedules.  EXBS Advisor

earlier in the month.  EXBS Advisor noted that while the CBP 
delegation will make certain recommendations when they return 
to Washington, actual work towards achieving these goals 
still will require future planning and cooperation.  Kocer 
stated he supported all efforts which would improve Turkish 
Customs targeting abilities and looks forward to future 
cooperation in this area.  EXBS Advisor provided updated 
information concerning the Turkish Customs International Sea 
Port Interdiction Training (ISIT), Radiation Detection
