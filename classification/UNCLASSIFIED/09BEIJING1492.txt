  Editorial Quotes

¶1. OBAMA'S VISIT TO THE MIDDLE EAST 
 
"The U.S. lowers its position; this is beneficial for world peace" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/03): "On June 2nd, Obama began his first 
trip to the Middle East.  His major goal is to reach a friendly hand 
to the Islamic world.  People can see that lowering himself and 
making efforts to improve relations with the Islamic world have been 
the two largest changes in Obama's Foreign Affairs policy.  However, 
his Middle East strategy does not largely drift from the U.S.' usual 
Middle East strategy.  Obama is trying to bring more balance to the 
situation in the region.  U.S. relations with Islamic world have 
been influenced by its own domestic politics.  To make the U.S. 
Middle East policy work depends on how much Obama can balance the 
domestic political strengths of the U.S." 
 
¶2. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a. "What does the G2 mean to the U.S.?" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/03): "Recent and frequent visits to China 
by American officials seem to be convincing evidence that the U.S. 
and China have deepened their reliance on each other.  In fact, many 
Chinese analysts have a misunderstanding concerning the meaning of 
the G2.  The U.S. doesn't have any intention to share their global 
control with China.  However, in most circumstances, because they 
are motivated by practical interests, some believe that the emphasis 
put on the G2 concept by Americans is the result of their 
recognition that the position of the U.S. is declining.  However, it 
is the opposite.  Obama has already emphasized the importance of 
U.S. leadership.  The fact that he took office represents their 
importance.  Many American officials don't pay much emphasis to the 
G2 idea.  There are various versions of the G2 concept.  The version 
by Kissinger, indicating that U.S.-China relations should not just 
benefit from each other but also be devoted to building up the new 
world order, is broader and more complete than other versions in its 
significance.  It fits the long-term interests of the two countries. 
 President Obama, on the one hand, emphasizes U.S. leadership, while 
on the other hand, promotes the reform of the economic system. 
However, he can hardly fulfill the two at the same time.  Obama's 
China policy is not yet stable under these circumstances." 
 
b. "Seeking harmony with China is not necessarily a regular U.S. 
policy" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (06/03): "The 
modest and friendly impression given by Geithner during his visit 
hardly resembles his earlier comments concerning China's exchange 
rate manipulation.  The U.S. needs China.  They are watching China's 
performance to see if China will satisfy their demands.  These 
factors will decide how long the U.S. stance on China will be 
sustained.  The U.S.-China bilateral relationship is the most 
important relationship.  However, China needs to not only reply to 
calls from the U.S., but it must also be concerned about its own 
national interests.  The U.S. should not bring forward unreasonable 
requests to China. After Obama took office, the relations have 
surpassed two hurdles, first the weird downward slide of the 
U.S.-China relations whenever elections are held and second, 
surpassed expectations for continuing the positive side of the 
relationship and moving it forward." 
 
¶3. GEITHNER'S VISIT 
 
"Friends during difficult times are real friends" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(06/03): "Friends 
during difficult times are real friends.  When Secretary Geithner 
visited China, his second title was the Special envoy of the 
President of the United States.  Although Obama hasn't visited 
China, the visit by a Presidential envoy proves that Geithner's 
visit has the backing of the country.  Geithner brought promises 
that relieved China's concerns.  But the promises are also aimed at 
exchanging policies.  The U.S. hopes that China will increase its 
holding of American bonds.  In the short-term, Geithner's visit 
hopes to gain more capital from China; and in the long-term, it 
shows Obama's way to resolve crisis.  The U.S. realizes its high 
reliance on other countries and makes efforts to maintain it.  The 
U.S. must protect other country's interests like it protects its 
own.  Geithner's promises to China show that the U.S. is at least 
aware of this."
