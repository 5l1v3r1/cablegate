SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: DPP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FRANK HSIEH'S 
U.S. TRIP 
 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage August 3 on the collapse of a bridge in Minnesota Thursday, 
on Taiwan's UN bid, on the DPP's "Normal Country Resolution" draft, 
and on the legislative elections slated for January.  Several papers 
also carried U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey's 
remarks on President Chen Shui-bian's transit request and a U.S. 
visa waiver program at a Foreign Press Center briefing Wednesday. 
In terms of editorials and commentaries, an editorial in the 
pro-unification "United Daily News" criticized DPP presidential 
candidate Frank Hsieh for contradicting himself in terms of his 
discourse on Taiwan independence.   End summary. 
 
"Frank Hsieh Had Better Be Careful and Not Transform Himself into a 
Taiwan Nazi" 
 
The pro-unification "United Daily News" [circulation: 400,000] 
editorialized (8/3): 
 
"As expected, the remarks Frank Hsieh made during his visit to the 
United States were greatly different from those he made after he 
returned to Taiwan.  He was saying one thing in the States but 
something totally different in Taiwan. ...  Following his trip to 
the United States, the structure of Hsieh's discourse has basically 
taken shape, but it is full of inconsistency. ... 
 
"Hsieh denied 'Taiwan independence' [in the United States], which 
made his discourse pretty hollow, and what's left is nothing but 
Nazi-like 'ethnic struggles.'  Just take a look at how Hsieh has 
swung from one side to the other and has gone back on his word in 
terms of his elaboration on Taiwan independence over the past few 
weeks. ...  Based on the DPP's 'Resolution on Taiwan's Future' 
[passed in 1999], Hsieh announced his 'Three Nos' in the United 
States -- namely, there is no need for a referendum on Taiwan 
independence, for the Taiwan independence movements, and for Taiwan 
to declare independence -- which is by nature anti-'de jure Taiwan 
independence.'  To everyone's surprise, after he returned to Taiwan, 
he changed his story and said he will complete 'name change and the 
writing of a new constitution' within five years, adding that this 
is not 'de jure independence.'  Hsieh opposed Taiwan independence 
while in the United States but advocated it after he returned to 
Taiwan.  Can one not call such an incomplete discourse on Taiwan 
independence something that 'deceives Hsieh himself and others?' 
... 
 
"Originally Hsieh was unique with his 'constitutional one China' 
doctrine and his call for 'reconciliation and co-existence.'  But 
ever since [last year's] Taipei mayoral election, the DPP's 
presidential primary, followed by his U.S. trip, Hsieh's discourse 
on unification and independence has gone completely contradictory 
and confusing.  Given the controversies over his scandals and his 
choice of a running mate, Hsieh's discourse has transformed and 
become focused on 'Taiwan-style Nazism,' which is incompatible with 
'Hsieh's Three Nos' and contradictory to Hsieh's call for 
'reconciliation and co-existence.'  Hsieh should keep himself 
vigilant:  How can he be regarded as a president who stands up as a 
model for all the Taiwan people if he is viewed as a 'crafty and 
deceptive' presidential candidate? ..."
