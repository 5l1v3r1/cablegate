PRESIDENT OF SUDAN; U.S. ECONOMY 
 
TOPICS:

¶2. ICC Arrest Warrant for President of Sudan

HEADLINES AND EXCERPTS: 
 
¶1. Afghanistan 
 
"Obama is on mark with approach to Taliban" 
 
The independent English-language South China Morning Post remarked 
in an editorial (3/9):  "Afghanistan's problems are endemic and 
cannot be resolved by military force.  Nor can they be dealt with by 
political pressure or money.  Peace and stability are for the Afghan 
people to bring about.  But if the Muslim extremism that is so 
rampant in parts of their country and neighboring Pakistan is to be 
contained, every effort has to be made by foreign governments to 
assuage the threat.  U.S. President Barack Obama has the right 
approach.  His suggestion that talks could be held with moderate 
elements of the country's former fundamentalist rulers, the Taliban, 
points to a more reasoned search for peace than that of his 
predecessor, George W. Bush....  The grip of Taliban extremism is 
tightening in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Drugs from Afghan fields 
are flooding across borders in record amounts.  Foreign governments 
have a right to be concerned.  But there needs to be a shift in 
attitude - and hopefully, Mr. Obama can properly articulate and 
enact it....  There are overriding rules to follow if the threat of 
extremism is to be lessened.  At their heart must be an appreciation 
of the beliefs, culture and religion of those at the other side of 
the negotiating table.  Through understanding can come trust and, 
perhaps, influence." 
 
¶2. ICC Arrest Warrant for President of Sudan 
 
"ICC does not help broker peace by issuing the arrest warrant for 
Sudan's President" 
 
The independent Chinese-language Ming Pao Daily News had an 
editorial (3/8):  "...Issuing the arrest warrant for Omar al-Bashir 
is of no benefit.  ICC does not seem to have considered it 
thoroughly.  China and Russia said that the ICC's decision will not 
lead to a peaceful solution to the Sudan issue.  Russia also said 
that ICC's move has set a 'dangerous example'.  Sudan's domestic 
economy has been improved and Sudan has basically paid all its 
foreign debts.  If al-Bashir is arrested at this time, the 
anti-government armed forces in Darfur will become active.  The 
Sudanese government will definitely resort to force.  Sudanese 
people will, inevitably, be plunged into misery and suffering. 
Another humanitarian disaster may emerge.  If this is the case, it 
will be an irony for the ICC which orders the arrest of al-Bashir on 
the charge of crimes against humanity." 
 
¶3. U.S. economy 
 
"Guard against the 'Obama bear market' turning into the 'Obama 
depression'" 
 
The independent Chinese-language Hong Kong Economic Times commented 
in an editorial (3/9):  "U.S. Dow Jones Index has hit new low. 
Since President Obama took office, the Dow Jones Index has fallen 20 
percent.  Some analysts joke that it is the 'Obama bear market'. 
But people are more worried about the real economy.  Since the 
unemployment rate is worsening rapidly, if Obama cannot restore 
people's confidence and curb the vicious cycle of the economy, the 
'Obama depression' may occur....  Just as Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao 
has said, 'confidence is more important than gold.'  If one has to 
restore the confidence, taking action 'earlier is better than later' 
and taking 'strong measures is better than weak.'  Obama must give a 
powerful and quick punch before he can improve the economic 
situation.  If Obama fails to stabilize public confidence, the 
economy will fall into a vicious cycle, resulting in a depression. 
Obama is facing a severe test and this will also be a severe test 
for the global economy."
