DECISION 
 
REF: A. MADRID 469 
     ¶B. 08 MADRID 1362 
 
1.(U) On June 5, the Nuclear Security Council (CSN) 
recommended that the GOS approve a request to extend the 
operating license of the Santa Maria de Garona nuclear power 
plant by 10 years from its scheduled expiration date of July 
¶5.  Garona, located in the northern province of Burgos, is 
the oldest and smallest of Spain,s 8 nuclear power plants, 
in operation since 1971.  The recommendation now goes to 
Minister of Industry, Tourism, and Commerce Miguel Sebastian 
for a decision by July 5, but the final say doubtless will 
belong to President Zapatero.  If the GOS does not decide to 
extend the license, the plant would close in 2011. 
 
2.(U) Garona is a relatively small plant, generating only 
1.3% of Spain,s electricity last year.  However, the 
decision will be a precedent for decisions next year on three 
larger plants.  Zapatero has consistently opposed expanding 
Spain,s use of nuclear power, and the PSOE had promised 
during the 2008 campaign not to extend licenses beyond 
plants,  useful lives,, generally assumed to mean their 
original 40-year licenses.  The GOS has previously closed 
other plants.  However, there are some indications that 
extension of Garona,s license is politically possible.  One 
press report suggested that an agreement for extension had 
been worked out several weeks ago before falling apart, and 
Zapatero cautioned last month that the CSN recommendation 
would play an important role in the government,s decision. 
Nuclear power provides almost 20% of Spain,s electricity, 
and its lack of CO2 emissions contributes to another Zapatero 
priority, the fight against climate change.  Given the 
expense Spain will incur to buy emission offsets from abroad 
to compensate for its failure to meet Kyoto CO2 emissions 
targets, closing this and other nuclear plants would be 
costly.  Advocates of extension argue that the facility in 
Garona is almost identical to a plant of the same age in 
Minnesota that has a state license to operate until 2031. 
The opposition PP and labor groups support maintaining 
current plants open as long as they are viable and building 
new plants.  However, a 2008 poll found that 48 percent of 
Spaniards opposed expanding nuclear power and 40 percent 
favored it. 
 
3.(U) Comment:  Zapatero,s statements have been ambiguous 
enough that proponents of extending the plant,s license hope 
he will decide to extend the license.  Political factors 
certainly will play an important role in the decision.  One 
press report indicated that the PSOE-appointed members of the 
CSN had agreed to recommend approval only if the 
recommendation, which was due June 5, would not be made 
public until June 8, after Spaniards voted in the European 
Parliament elections.
