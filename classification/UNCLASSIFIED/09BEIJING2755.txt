Iran Sanctions 
-------------- 
 
¶2.  Asked at the regularly scheduled September 24 to comment on 
China's position on potential sanctions against Iran, MFA 
spokesperson Jiang Yu said China has always believed that "sanctions 
and pressure are not the way out" and are not conducive to 
diplomatic efforts.  The September 23 P5 Foreign Ministers statement 
on the Iranian nuclear issue emphasized dialogue and negotiation, 
Jiang said.  China hopes all parties will seize diplomatic 
opportunities and push for positive outcomes during the upcoming 
P5-plus-one meeting. 
 
G-20 Summit 
----------- 
 
¶3.  Jiang noted that the G-20, as an organization that represented 
the major economies of the world, should operate under the principle 
of equality, cooperative partnerships and multilateralism.  On 
September 25 President Hu will give an important speech at the third 
G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh which will address the global economic 
situation, Jiang said. 
 
China, South Korea, Japan Trilateral Talks 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. Jiang noted that a trilateral PRC-ROK-Japan Foreign Ministers' 
meeting will take place in Shanghai on September 28.  This will be 
followed by the second Trilateral Summit to be held in Beijing on 
October 10.  The summit and ministerial meetings will focus on 
trilateral cooperation, regional and international issues and East 
Asian cooperation, Jiang said.  Separately, FM Yang will be holding 
bilateral meetings with his visiting ROK and Japanese counterparts. 
 
Rebiya Kadeer Travel to Taiwan 
------------------------------ 
 
¶5. Asked about reports that Rebiya Kadeer had been invited to visit 
Taiwan, Jiang referred the question to "competent authorities." 
 
Australia-China Mining Joint Venture Activity 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. Responding to reports that the Australian government had denied 
permission for a Chinese company to invest in the Woomera Prohibited 
Area, Jiang replied that China has always supported cooperation with 
other countries by Chinese enterprises.  China has always been open 
to foreign enterprises and hoped that others would welcome us as 
well, Jiang said.
