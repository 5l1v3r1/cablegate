BRIEFING 
 
 
Iraq: "Hurriyet" reports that Turkey has started evaluating 
US' demands for a possible operation against Iraq.  If the 
US were to deploy 60,000 troops in Northern Iraq, according 
to the report, Turkey will deploy even a larger number of 
troops to show its intention to prevent the establishment of 
a Kurdish State there.  Turkey is reportedly against the 
deployment of British troops in Northern Iraq under any 
circumstances.  "Cumhuriyet" reports that discussions 
between the US and Turkey about the use of Turkish resources 
in a possible war are continuing.  Within this framework, a 
US military-technical delegation will be coming to Turkey 
this week to examine the airports in Diyarbakir, Mus, 
Batman, and Malatya.  "Yeni Safak" reports that during the 
Iraqi opposition meeting in London, opposition leaders 
agreed that they are against the presence of a foreign 
military power in Iraq after the fall of Saddam. 
 
 
Cyprus: "Radikal" reports that TRNC president Denktas is 
seeking new ways to prevent a settlement in Cyprus.  Denktas 
met with TRNC officials in Ankara yesterday to discuss a new 
strategy to counteract pressure for a settlement.  The paper 
adds that the EU decision to open the accession doors to the 
Greek Cypriots has created tension in the TRNC.  Opposition 
parties in the TRNC have asked Denktas to step down and 
transfer his responsibilities as negotiator to someone else. 
"Sabah" reports that there are rumors in Cyprus that Denktas 
will resign.  "Hurriyet" reports that Turkey has started 
work to achieve a settlement in Cyprus by February 28. 
Turkish officials have already informed the UN about their 
intention to support talks for settlement, and they will be 
meeting with TRNC president Denktas today. 
 
 
IMF: "Hurriyet" reports that a visiting IMF delegation will 
hold contacts in Turkey until the end of this week.  The IMF 
has been bothered by some aspects of the government's Urgent 
Action Plan, a proposed package on tax amnesty, high 
hazelnut support prices, and the public tender law.  The IMF 
delegation will return to Turkey in January. 
 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION:  Cyprus 
 
 
"Time for a solution" 
 Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (12/17): 
"Following the Copenhagen summit, it is inevitable that 
negotiations on Cyprus will begin based on the Annan plan. 
A settlement within the next 2.5 months will make both sides 
of Cyprus a member of the EU. . There are two opposing views 
in both Turkey and in Northern Cyprus.  One view calls for a 
settlement before the EU deadline, while the other advocates 
a process of integration with Turkey.  . The AKP government 
seems to favor a settlement to the issue.  This is certainly 
the best option for both Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots. 
It is indeed the time for a settlement on the island.  It is 
time to look ahead with a broad horizon, and to leave 
skepticism and old mentalities behind us." 
 
 
"The Cyprus test for AKP" 
Cengiz Candar wrote in Islamic-intellectual Yeni Safak 
(12/17): "The Turkish Cypriot leader Denktas should be given 
a last chance for a settlement.  He should feel obliged to 
declare that he considers the Annan plan as a basis for an 
agreement, not only a basis for negotiations.  If he is 
reluctant to do that, and if the AKP really wants to be in 
charge, Turkey should withdraw its support for Denktas, and 
the Turkish Cypriots should go to either an election or a 
referendum. . Cyprus is very much Turkey's business, thus 
Ankara does not have the luxury of saying to Denktas: `do 
whatever you think is right.'  The Cyprus policy should be 
formulated in Ankara, and implemented accordingly."
