¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, IEG RAS (INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL GEOSCIENCE, 
RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES), Moscow, Russia. The 
company is listed on BIS license application: NLR as 
the ultimate consignee of one (1) seismograph, spares 
and accessories.  ECCN 0X000. Controlled by the 
Department's Export Control Administration 
Regulations. The exporter is Geometrics, 2190 Fortune 
Drive, San Jose, CA  95131. 
 
¶3. On July 1, 2008, Export Control Attach Peter 
Liston and Commercial Specialist Valaria Khalina 
conducted the requested post-shipment verification 
with IEG RAS (INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL GEOSCIENCE, 
RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES), Moscow, Russia. The 
export control team met with Senior Lead Scientist 
Nikita A. Raqozin and his associate, Lead Scientist 
Dr. Isaak G. Mindel. 
 
¶4. The IEG RAS was established on May 21, 1996 as an 
Engineering Geological, Geoenvironmental and 
Seimological Research Center.  The multi-field 
research center consists of 16 laboratories, among 
them 8 laboratories engaged in geoenvironmental and 
engineering geological research, 3 within the 
Seisomogical Center, 2 at the St Petersburg Division, 
and 3 general-purpose laboratories.  The Institute 
employs approximately 100 people, 80 of which are 
researchers and scientist.  The staff at IEG RAS has 
performed more than 150 contract research projects, 
the customers being large Russian and foreign 
companies, i.e., joint-stock companies Gazprom, 
Lukoil, ALROSA, Sakalinenergy, as well as the 
government administrations of Moscow, St Petersburg, 
Tatarstan Republic, Leningrad and Krasnodar regions. 
 
¶5. The IEG RAS conducts research and testing 
throughout Russia and the CIS and there is ample open 
source information available on the Institute.  The 
commodity in reftel, the seismograph, spares and 
accessories, was in use by IEG RAS engineers at the 
time of the PSV and was therefore unavailable for 
inspection by the Export Control Team.  At the request 
of the Export Control Team, Nikita A. Raqozin did 
produce the invoice and purchase agreement from 
Geometrics of San Jose, CA, for the seismograph, 
spares and accessories and stated that the Institute 
had in fact purchased two (2) seismographs from 
Geometrics not one (1) as indicated in reftel.  Nikita 
A Raqozin did offer to make the reftel commodity 
available to the Export Control Team at a later date 
if requested. 
 
¶6.  The Export Control Team did not find any of the 
Institute's answers evasive.  The subject commodity is 
consistent with equipment used by the Institution. 
The Institution advised the ECO of an additional 
seismograph in the purchase order that Commerce was 
not aware of.  Lastly, there are no indications of 
impropriety. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends IEG RAS (INSTITUTE 
OF ENVIRONMENTAL GEOSCIENCE, RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF 
SCIENCES), Russia as reliable recipients of sensitive 
U.S. origin commodities.
