SUBJECT: INDEPENDENT CAMPAIGN PREVAILS OVER UNITED RUSSIA MACHINE IN 
NIZHNY TAGIL 
 
REF: YEKATERINBURG 62 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The October 12 Municipal elections in Nizhny Tagil 
resulted in a rare defeat in United Russia's (UR) scorebook, but 
one which party publicists have sought to characterize as a 
victory.  The campaign demonstrated that UR's overwhelming 
"administrative" resources do not always guarantee victory over 
a popular candidate running a strong campaign.  Valentina 
Isayeva, a UR member who campaigned as an independent when she 
didn't receive the support of the party leadership, polled 37% 
of the vote to defeat the official UR-backed candidate Aleksey 
Chekanov, who finished a distant third. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On October 23, local internet news sites reported 
rumors that the fiasco in Nizhny Tagil may cost Aleksandr Levin 
his job as head of UR's Sverdlovsk Oblast organization, but our 
party contacts will not confirm this.  Levin is Sverdlovsk 
Oblast Governor Eduard Rossel's closest political confidant. 
Levin's fate may not become clear until after UR council 
meetings on the federal level next week.  The result of those 
deliberations may indicate the extent to which maneuvering in 
anticipation of the expiration of Rossel's term in office next 
fall has already begun. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In dissecting this contentious intraparty squabble, 
local independent political analysts faulted United Russia for 
choosing a weak candidate and running a poorly organized, 
low-budget campaign.  According to our contacts, Chekanov, a 
local businessman, appeared unmotivated and allowed regional 
party authorities to dominate his campaign.  Isayeva, on the 
other hand, started from a strong position as deputy chairman of 
the city duma.  She ran a vigorous grassroots campaign, a tactic 
that was necessitated by her virtual exclusion from local TV 
coverage, according to press reports quoting her campaign 
manager.  Though Isayeva was initially threatened with expulsion 
from the party when she declared her candidacy, she ultimately 
retained her UR membership.  This has enabled UR to assert that 
the elections represent an overall victory for UR because the 
top three vote-getters were all UR members. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) One local insider acknowledged that Chekanov may not 
have been the best candidate, but party leaders believed they 
could dissuade Isayeva and others from running.  In addition, 
according to this operative, UR strategists underestimated the 
appeal of a female candidate.  Other analysts believe that the 
example of Nizhny Tagil could stimulate competition both within 
and outside the party.  The turmoil within the local UR 
organization may lead to recognition of the value of more open 
intraparty competition in selecting candidates.  Meanwhile, 
non-UR candidates may see the result in Nizhny Tagil as an 
example of how a determined challenger can defeat a vulnerable 
UR candidate.
