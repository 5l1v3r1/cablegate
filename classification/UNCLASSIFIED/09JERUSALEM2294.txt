SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (12/18): President Abbas: "There 
is no Palestine without Jerusalem" 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The three dailies lead with news on Palestinian Authority (PA) 
President Mahmoud Abbas' visit to Nablus yesterday to participate in 
the closing event of the Al-Quds Capital of Arab Culture festival. 
Abbas is quoted in the dailies and independent news outlet Maan 
reiterating that Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine and that 
"there is no Palestine without Jerusalem, no one will accept this. 
Without Jerusalem there will be no peace." 
 
Independent daily Al-Ayyam and PA official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
front page photos of Israeli police and military forces shutting 
down events related to the cultural festival in Jerusalem yesterday 
arresting several people, including Fatah officials. Abbas condemned 
the incident and referred to the attacks as "barbaric acts carried 
out against unarmed civilians." He also said this incident made him 
doubt whether Israelis truly aspired to peace. 
 
Independent daily Al-Quds leads with news on Robert Serry, UN 
Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, telling the 
UN Security Council on Thursday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu's temporary settlement construction freeze falls short of 
Israel's obligations under the Road Map. Serry added that the 
temporary settlement freeze has no positive impact on the peace 
process. 
 
Al-Ayyam front pages a report on Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor 
Lieberman stating yesterday that Israel will pursue settlement 
construction at a high speed once the ten month moratorium is over. 
 
 
Citing PA news outlet Wafa, Al-Quds front pages news that the 
Jerusalem Municipality submitted demolition orders yesterday against 
seven houses in the Jabal Al-Mukabber neighborhood, which will leave 
51 adults and 33 children homeless.  According to the report, the 
Israeli authorities gave the families ten days to evacuate the 
homes. 
 
Al-Ayyam front pages news on Palestinian sources telling the 
London-based Al-Sharq Al-Awsat that Israel refuses to release a 
number of Hamas leaders in the prisoner swap deal for security 
reasons. The sources also noted that there is a conflict within 
Hamas itself regarding the deal.

The arrest warrant issued by a British court for former Israeli 
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni for her involvement in Israel's assault 
on Gaza last winter was heavily discussed in the Palestinian 
blogosphere. A blog by Khalid Amayreh, a journalist from Hebron, 
said, "Britain must not allow itself to be bullied by this bullying 
criminal entity [Israel]." 
 
A blog by Iyad Burnat, a peace activist from Bilin, writes his blog 
under the title "Words Are Not Enough" saying, "We [Palestinians] 
are a simple people, and more than anything we want to see peace. 
But before there is peace there must be justice, and we must have 
our freedom. We are not against Jews or Israelis, but we are against 
the occupation."

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
Al-Quds runs an editorial under the title "Why is there a Targeted 
Attack Against Al-Aqsa Mosque?" (12/18): "In order to maintain 
stability in the region and in the world, Muslims should not be 
denied access to pray in Al-Aqsa mosque, and Jewish extremists 
should be prevented from provoking the feelings of Muslims on every 
Jewish holiday if we want to support a just peace and the peaceful 
coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis."
