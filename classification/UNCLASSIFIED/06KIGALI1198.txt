SUBJECT: RWANDA UPDATE OF WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR 
INFORMATION 
 
REF: A. STATE 184972 
 
     ¶B. KIGALI 192 
 
¶1.  Summary.  There are few updates to post's August 
submission of Worst Forms of Child Labor information for 
mandatory reporting requirements as requested (ref A).  GOR 
continues to take the issue seriously; however, progress is 
gradual due to the lack of capacity in the Ministries charged 
with execution of the government's five-year action plan. 
End summary. 
 
Incidence and Nature of Child Labor 
----------------------------------- 
¶2.  The most recent relevant statistics from UNICEF (ref B) 
are: 
-- 352,550 children are engaged in child labor 
-- 83.1 percent in the commercial agricultural sector 
-- 11.9 percent in the domestic sector 
-- 1.2 percent in commerce 
-- 0.7 percent in manufacturing 
-- 7,000 street children 
-- 1.3 million orphans (defined by the GOR as children with 
   no or one parent) 
-- 106,000 child headed households 
 
Child Labor Laws and Enforcement 
-------------------------------- 
¶3.  The GOR's lead authority for implementation and 
enforcement of proscriptions against worst forms of child 
labor continues to be the Ministry of Public Service, Skills 
Development and Labor (MIFOTRA).  In August a MIFOTRA 
training workshop for labor inspectors included a session on 
child labor issues.  According to MIFOTRA Director of Labor 
Inspectors, Julie Kamukala, GOR labor inspectors will be 
integrating child labor issues into district performance 
contracts.  The government has thirty labor inspectors that 
address child labor issues (Note. Rwanda is comprised of four 
provinces and thirty districts. End note).   When inspectors 
find cases of child labor they generally educate the violator 
on Rwandan child labor laws and issue a warning.  On 12 
December, Kamukala said MIFORTA labor inspectors would begin 
keeping track of child labor law enforcement statistics in 
2007 but there are no current statistics on how many labor 
inspections were conducted in 2006. 
 
Current Policies and Programs to Eliminate the WFCL 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
¶4.  In addition to the work by the Labor Inspectors 
Department of MIFOTRA, the Ministry of Gender and Family 
Promotion, with assistance from UNICEF and Save the Children, 
continues to develop the National Action Plan for Orphans and 
Vulnerable Children Plan of Action.  There are child issues 
courts operating but they have not yet handled child labor 
cases. 
 
¶5.  Comment.  It is country team's view that the GOR 
continues to make progress towards eliminating the worst 
forms of child labor.  End comment.
