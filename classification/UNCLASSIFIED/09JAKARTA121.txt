¶1.  (U) This message was coordinated with Consulate General 
Surabaya and Consulate Medan. 
 
¶2.  (U) SUMMARY:  Indonesians across the archipelago 
exuberantly greeted President Barack Obama's Inauguration on 
January 20.  At a formal ball in Jakarta held during the 
Inauguration ceremonies, a Presidential advisor read a 
statement from President Yudhoyono pledging Indonesia's 
fullest cooperation with President Obama in order to promote 
"enduring peace and progress."  President Obama's sister, 
Maya Soetoro-Ng, in a video statement responded with a 
written message from the President, stating, in part, "My 
childhood years in Jakarta provided me with many lessons and 
memories that I carry with me to this day."  Media play was 
overwhelmingly positive.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CELEBRATING THE NEW PRESIDENT 
 
¶3.  (U) Celebrations were held across Indonesia in honor of 
the January 20 Inaugural ceremonies.  At an "Inauguration 
Ball" held by "the Friends of Obama" at the Jakarta Ritz 
Carlton, attended by Ambassador Hume, Presidential advisor 
Dino Patti Djalal read a warm message from President 
Yudhoyono.  Yudhoyono noted that President Obama had spent 
part of his childhood in Indonesia and understands the 
Indonesian people well, adding that he looks "forward to 
welcoming him back someday."  In a video statement, Maya 
Soetoro-Ng, now living in Hawaii, read a warm message on 
behalf of her brother in which he fondly remembered his 
childhood years in Jakarta.  The full text of both messages 
is contained in paras 9-10. 
 
¶4.  (U) Ambassador Hume, in his remarks at the ball, 
discussed the two country's partnership and hailed their 
close cooperation in many fields.  The Ambassador said 
"Americans have reason to be grateful" that President Obama 
had lived in Indonesia. 
 
¶5.  (U) At a "blessing" (selamatan) ceremony held by 
President Obama's former classmates at his childhood school 
in Jakarta, Primary School Menteng 1 (see reftel), one of his 
former schoolmates and successful designer, Maya Suharnoko, 
said, "This is a dream come true, I hope not only for 
Americans but also for the citizens of the world, because 
Obama is a child of the world, so this is also our victory." 
In Medan, North Sumatra, a Consulate exhibition of poster art 
depicting President Obama, by American artists, was 
enthusiastically attended, while five Sumatran governors were 
among the thousands who sent goodwill messages.  The 
Ambassador also spoke at an American Chamber of Commerce 
event held in Jakarta on January 21. 
 
MEDIA EFFUSIVE 
 
¶6.  (U) Indonesian media of all stripes blanketed the nation 
with glowing stories about the Inauguration.  This included 
complete television coverage of Inauguration ceremonies until 
the wee hours of the morning Jakarta time. Reportedly, 
millions of viewers stayed up past 3 a.m. to watch. 
Newspaper commentary praised the inauguration of the first 
African-American President and noted that America is a nation 
of change.  Many of the reporters and commentators were those 
whom the Embassy facilitated or funded to cover the elections 
in the fall. 
 
¶7.  (U) Indonesia's most respected national daily "Kompas" 
penned an editorial reflecting the views of many Indonesians, 
stating, "The 44th U.S. President will bring a fresh wind of 
big change in the midst of a world under extreme pressure 
from the economic crisis, climate chaos, breakout of war in a 
number of places."  The Ambassador and other Mission officers 
gave numerous interviews discussing the Inauguration, 
including commentary in Bahasa Indonesia by Dep Pol/C during 
a five-hour television show of the live Inauguration events. 
 
¶8.  (U) Only a few expressed reservations about President 
Obama's Inauguration speech, regretting that it did not deal 
more with the Middle East.  However, the head of the upper 
house of Parliament Hidayat Nur Wahid, a popular conservative

Muslim, commented, "In the context of the Muslim world, Obama 
is committed to knit new relationships based on ties of 
mutual trust, benefit and openness."
