SUBJECT: NINEWA: PRT EMERGENCY PLANNING EFFORTS BEAR FRUIT 
WITH PROVINCIAL INITIATIVE 
 
This is a Ninewa Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) message. 
 
Civic Leaders Working Together 
   for Emergency Preparedness 
------------------------------ 
 
¶1. (U) After months of hard work to raise the profile of 
emergency preparedness among government officials in Ninewa, 
the PRT's efforts paid off January 23 when a large group of 
provincial and local officials, led by Provincial Governor 
Duraid Kashmoula, convened to outline the initial steps for 
an improved emergency action plan for Ninewa province. 
Thanks to USAID, the PRT has twice brought in a senior 
consultant on emergency preparedness to assess the situation 
in the province and to work with the Iraqi civil servants 
responsible in the event of a serious incident, such as a 
flood, a large-scale fire or a city-wide terrorist attack, 
and we have linked this with a requested ongoing program of 
support for the province in this critical area. 
 
Governor Gives Full Support 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Governor Kashmoula publicly empowered the provincial 
fire chief, BG Mohammad Suleiman, to lead the effort to 
create a comprehensive emergency action plan.  Over 50 
officials, including all the Mayors in the Tigris river 
valley, district police chiefs, relevant Provincial Directors 
General, and the Ninewa Civil Defense Director, attended the 
January 23 meeting and took an active participatory role in 
forward planning.  At the meeting, the Governor also pledged 
his strong support for emergency planning in the province. 
 
Table-Top Exercise in February 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (U) The meeting concluded with an agreement to conduct a 
formal "table-top exercise" in February with all important 
stakeholders.  The committee also agreed to meet on a monthly 
basis to address emergency planning and civil defense needs 
for Ninewa. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶4. (U) It is promising that provincial officials across 
agency lines have taken this first vital step in meeting the 
key provincial goal of a strong emergency management plan. 
The PRT will continue to work closely with the committee to 
improve on its plan, and will provide the technical expertise 
needed to move the plan forward, including by improving the 
early-warning system of an imminent threat to the population. 
 The PRT will continue to help the committee put in a place a 
sound, workable plan that will really make a difference in 
the event of a major emergency.
