TOPIC: Kennedy's death 
 
HEADLINES AND EXCERPTS: 
 
"Kennedy leaves unfinished legacy" 
 
The independent English-language South China Morning Post remarked 
in an editorial (8/27):  "An avalanche of tributes from 
international statesmen is customary on the passing of a former 
world leader.  When it is for an old political warrior fated never 
to achieve the highest office, it is extraordinary....  Despite a 
life dogged by more family tragedies, Senator Kennedy established a 
reputation beyond America's shores as one of his country's most 
effective lawmakers, crafting deals with presidents and politicians 
of both major parties.  The man who might have been president became 
known as the lion of the senate and a great patriot.  His abiding 
cause was reform of health care.  In one of his last speeches he 
cited his own illness, acknowledging he had benefited from a quality 
of medical care denied to millions.  He did not live to see his 
dream of health reform prevail over political opposition.  But his 
endorsement was important to the White House candidacy of President 
Barack Obama, who has taken up the cause." 
 
"Democratic Party's senior statesman dies, Obama loses his backing" 
 
The mass-circulation Chinese-language The Sun wrote in its column 
'Sun's View' (8/27):  "...Many commentaries said that following the 
passing away of Edward Kennedy, the Kennedy family, which has been 
commanding the wind and the clouds in the political arena for 
several decades, is declining.  It can be said that Kennedy's death 
symbolizes the end of an era.  Currently, medical reform has 
triggered heated debates in the U.S.  Edward [Kennedy] has not only 
struggled for that for several decades, but his dexterous political 
skill has helped to narrow the differences between the Democratic 
and Republican parties.  The passing away of Edward at this time 
will leave Obama, who has been rebuffed for promoting medical 
reform, without an important supporter."
