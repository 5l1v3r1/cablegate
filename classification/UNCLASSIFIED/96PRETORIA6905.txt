¶1.  ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS CABLES HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED SOME 
OF THESE ISSUES, FOLLOWING ARE GENERAL RESPONSES TO 
QUESTIONS POSED REF A.  SEPTELS ON SPECIFIC ISSUES (LAND, 
HOUSING, TRADITIONAL/CUSTOMARY LAW) AS WELL AS SEPTEL 
ADDRESSING POST'S ACTIONS TO PROMOTE GENDER EQUALITY WILL 
FOLLOW. 
 
¶2.  SUMMARY: SINCE THE 1994 ELECTIONS, THE SAG HAS BEEN 
QUITE COMMITTED TO THE RECOGNITION AND AMELIORATION OF 
THE PLIGHT OF SOUTH AFRICAN WOMEN.  IT HAS RECENTLY 
SUCCEEDED IN CARRYING OUT SEVERAL OF ITS SPECIFIC POST- 
BEIJING PLANS (SEE REF. B) INCLUDING RATIFICATION OF THE 
UN CEDAW IN JANUARY 1996, PROVISION OF FREE HEALTH CARE 
FOR PREGNANT WOMEN, AND THE PASSAGE OF THE COMMISSION ON 
GENDER EQUALITY ACT 39 OF 1996.  NEVERTHELESS, IN MANY 
AREAS, THE SAG, THOUGH PUBLICLY COMMITTED TO REFORM, IS 
SLOW TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------- 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS/LAW 
------------------------- 
¶3.  THE NEW CONSTITUTION, ADOPTED IN MAY OF THIS YEAR, 
GUARANTEES EQUALITY, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, FREEDOM AND 
SECURITY OF PERSON, AND HOUSING, HEALTH CARE, FOOD, WATER 
AND SOCIAL SECURITY.  EQUALITY CLAUSE 9.3 IN THE BILL OF 
RIGHTS IS QUITE EXTENSIVE, PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION ON 
THE GROUNDS OF GENDER, SEX, PREGNANCY, MARITAL STATUS, 
AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  INEVITABLY 
HOWEVER, DISCREPANCIES STILL EXIST BETWEEN LAW AND 
PRACTICE.  ALTHOUGH CONSTITUTIONAL LAW OVERRIDES ANY 
POTENTIALLY DISCRIMINATORY CUSTOMARY LAWS, IT IS 
QUESTIONABLE HOW COGNIZANT WOMEN IN TRADITIONAL SOCIETIES 
ARE OF THEIR RIGHTS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
DOCUMENTS WHICH PROVIDE GENDER EQUALITY FRAMEWORK 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶4.  IN GENERAL, SEVERAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK 
FROM WHICH THE SAG, NGO'S, GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS CAN 
IMPLEMENT PROMOTION OF GENDER EQUALITY.  THE 
COMMONWEALTH'S "INTER-PARLIAMENTARY COUNCIL'S PLAN OF 
ACTION TO CORRECT PRESENT IMBALANCES IN THE PARTICIPATION 
OF MEN AND WOMEN IN POLITICAL LIFE," ADOPTED IN MARCH OF 
1994, IS USED WITHIN PARLIAMENT.  DOCUMENTS INFLUENCING 
EXTERNAL LEGISLATION INCLUDE THE "CHARTER FOR EFFECTIVE 
EQUALITY," PRODUCED BY THE WOMEN'S NATIONAL COALITION AND 
PRESENTED IN AUGUST OF 1994; THE BEIJING PLATFORM FOR 
ACTION; THE UNCEDAW; AND THE DRAFT POLICY FOR WOMEN'S 
EMPOWERMENT, FORMULATED BY THE NOW DEFUNCT RECONSTRUCTION 
AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (RDP). 
 
------------------------- 
PARLIAMENT AS INSTITUTION 
------------------------- 
¶5.  THE MARCH 1996 "REPORT ON WHAT THE S. AFRICAN 
PARLIAMENT HAS DONE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND 
STATUS OF WOMEN IN S.A." COVERS BOTH EXTERNAL LEGISLATION 
AND CHANGES WITHIN PARLIAMENT ITSELF TO PROMOTE GENDER 
EQUALITY SINCE THE 1994 ELECTIONS.  S. AFRICA RANKS 7TH 
IN THE WORLD IN TERMS OF REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN 
PARLIAMENT, WITH 101 WOMEN OUT OF 400 NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
MEMBERS, AND 16 OUT OF 90 SENATORS.  15 OUT OF 60 CHAIRS 
OF COMMITTEES ARE WOMEN, AND A WOMEN'S CAUCUS EXISTS. 
GENERALLY, WOMEN REPRESENT ABOUT 26OF PARLIAMENT (THE 
ANC CALLED FOR 33REPRESENTATION).  HOWEVER, THE REPORT 
NOTES THAT IN SPITE OF THESE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS, WOMEN 
ARE STILL NOT SPEAKING OUT TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL, AND 
PARLIAMENT REMAINS A MALE-DOMINATED INSTITUTION.  TO 
RECTIFY THIS, THE WORKING HOURS OF PARLIAMENT ARE BEING 
RE-EXAMINED IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE "MANY WOMEN MP'S WHO 
HAVE DOMESTIC AND CHILD-CARE RESPONSIBILITIES."  THE 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE FOR THE SUPPORT STAFF ARE 
ALSO BEING RE-EXAMINED, AS WOMEN IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN 
DISPROPORTIONATELY GIVEN SHORT TERM CONTRACTS WITH NO 
BENEFITS. FINALLY, A CRECHE/NURSERY HAS RECENTLY BEEN 
CREATED IN PARLIAMENT. 
 
-------------------- 
LEGISLATIVE ADVANCES 
-------------------- 
¶6.  THE UN CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF 
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN (CEDAW) WAS RATIFIED IN 
JANUARY 1996, MAKING SOUTH AFRICA THE 131ST NATION TO 
SIGN THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT.  THEN IN MARCH 1996, AN 
OFFICE ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE 
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.  THESE FOLLOWED PREVIOUS MEASURES TO 
EMPOWER WOMEN INCLUDING THE 1994 ESTABLISHMENT OF AUGUST 
9 AS NATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY, AND THE 1995 INCOME TAX ACT 
NO. 21, WHICH REPEALS THE DISCRIMINATORY TAX BURDEN ON 
MARRIED WOMEN BY APPLYING A SINGLE INCOME TAX RATE TO ALL 
INIVIDUALS, IRRESPECTIVE OF GENDER OR MARITAL STATUS. 
 
¶7.  TO ADDRESS SHORTCOMINGS IN RECENT HOUSING AND LAND 
ACTS WHICH FAIL TO CONSIDER THE PROBLEMS THAT WOMEN 
SPECIFICALLY MAY ENCOUNTER IN ACCESSING LAND OR HOUSING, 
THE INTERIM PROTECTION OF INFORMAL LAND RIGHTS ACT (1996) 
PROTECTS PEOPLE, MANY OF WHOM ARE WOMEN, WHO HAVE 
INSECURE AND INFORMAL RIGHTS AND INTERESTS IN LAND. 
SIMILARLY, THE COMMUNAL PROPERTY ASSOCIATIONS BILL, IF 
PASSED, WOULD PROVIDE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITH THE 
COLLECTIVE ABILITY TO ACQUIRE, HOLD AND MANAGE PROPERTY. 
 
¶8.  THE WATER RATIONALISATION AND AMENDMENT ACT (1994) 
CALLS FOR WOMEN TO COMPRISE ONE-THIRD OF LOCAL WATER 
SUPPLY AND SANITATION COMMITTEES, THUS ENABLING THEM TO 
PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN THE PLANNING, DESIGN, AND CONTROL 
OF WATER SCHEMES.  THE SOCIAL ASSISTANCE ACT AND 
AMENDMENT ACTS (1992/94) PROVIDE FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, 
MAINTENANCE GRANTS TO PARENTS FOR THE CARE OF THEIR 
CHILDREN.  HOWEVER, THE AGED PERSONS AMENDMENT ACT (1994) 
GENERALLY HURTS WOMEN BY DOING JUST THE OPPOSITE, 
REPEALING AN ATTENDANT'S ALLOWANCE FOR HOME-CARE. 
 
¶9.  LABOR ACTS:  THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND 
LABOUR COUNCIL ACT 35 BROADENED THE DEFINITION OF FARM 
WORKER TO INCLUDE DOMESTIC WORKERS ON FARMS; THIS 
BENEFITTED SOME WOMEN, BUT IT EXCLUDED SEASONAL AND 
CASUAL FARM LABOURERS, OFTEN WOMEN AS WELL.  SIMILARLY, 
THE LABOUR RELATIONS ACT OFFERS JOB SECURITY FOR DOMESTIC 
WORKERS AND PROHIBITS SEXUALLY DISCRIMINATORY CLAUSES IN 
A UNION'S CONSTITUTION, BUT VIOLATIONS STILL OCCUR, 
ACCORDING TO THE JUNE 17 JOHNNESBURG DAILY "SOWETAN."  IN 
TERMS OF BUSINESS, A RECENTLY PASSED SMALL BUSINESS BILL 
BENEFITS WOMEN BY CREATING AN INSTITUTIONAL AND 
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROMOTION OF SMALL, MEDIUM 
AND MICRO-ENTERPRISES. 
 
¶10.  BUDGET:  THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR A DEMOCRATIC 
ALTERNATIVE IN SOUTH AFRICA (IDASA) SPONSORED A WOMEN'S 
BUDGET INITIATIVE IN MARCH 1996 TO IDENTIFY THE BUDGETARY 
CHANGES NECESSARY TO IMPACT ON SPECIFIC WOMEN'S LIVES. 
DURING THE 1996 PARLIAMENTARY DELIBERATIONS ON THE BUDGET 
A NUMBER OF OFFICIALS DID PROVIDE INFORMATION ASSESSING 
GENDER-SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR BUDGETS, AS WELL AS 
THEIR DEPARTMENTS' EFFORTS TO PROMOTE WOMEN.

HEALTH

¶11. ABORTION BILL:  ON JULY 3 1996, THE CABINET APPROVED 
A BILL WHICH WOULD LIBERALIZE CURRENT ABORTION LAWS AND 
PROVIDE MORE EQUAL ACCESS TO HELP.  (SEE SEPTEL) 
 
¶12.  FREE HEALTH CARE:  A PRESIDENTIAL LEAD PROJECT 
SPEARHEADED UNDER THE FORMER RECONSTRUCTION AND 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (RDP) IS PROVIDING FREE HEALTH CARE 
FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN UNDER SIX. 
 
---------------------- 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
---------------------- 
¶13.  NEWSPAPERS REPORT THAT EVERY SIX DAYS, A WOMAN IS 
KILLED IN S. AFRICA BY HER HUSBAND OR BOYFRIEND.  THE 
PREVENTION OF FAMILY VIOLENCE ACT OF 1993 MAKES IT EASIER 
FOR WOMEN TO OBTAIN INTERDICTS AGAINST THIER ABUSIVE 
HUSBANDS AND PARTNERS.  THIS LAW ALSO DEFINES MARITAL 
RAPE AS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. CHERYL CAROLUS, ACTING ANC 
SECRETARY-GENERAL, TOLD EMBASSY OFFICIALS THAT ALTHOUGH 
THIS LAW IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE IN THE 
WORLD, TO DATE FEWER THAN TEN WOMEN HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE 
OF IT.  GIVEN THE HIGH INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN S. 
AFRICA, THE SAG HAD COMMITTED SPECIFICALLY TO 
ESTABLISHING MORE CENTERS FOR BATTERED WOMEN, YET TO WHAT 
EXTENT THIS IS BEING IMPLEMENTED IS UNCLEAR. 
 
--------------------- 
WATCHDOG INSTITUTIONS 
--------------------- 
 
¶14.   A HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION WHICH INVESTIGATES 
VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS TO 
THE GOVERNMENT ON MEASURES NEEDED TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS 
IS UP AND RUNNING. FOLLOWING IN ITS FOOTSTEPS, THE 
COMMISSION ON GENDER EQUALITY ACT OF MID-1996, WILL 
ESTABLISH A COMMISSION TO PROMOTE GENDER EQUALITY AND TO 
ADVISE/MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PARLIAMENT OR ANY OTHER 
LEGISLATURE AFFECTING WOMEN. 
 
¶15.  CONFERENCES:  MANY FOLLOW-UP CONFERENCES TO BEIJING 
HAVE TAKEN PLACE BOTH IN GOVERNMENT AND THROUGH NGO'S 
WHICH ILLUSTRATE S. AFRICA'S COMMITMENT TO REFORM 
BENEFITTING WOMEN. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND 
SUPPORT THE SAG'S INITIATIVES.
