SUBJECT: SPAIN: RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON IFC PRIVATE 
ENTERPRISE PARTNERSHIP FOR THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA 
 
REF: STATE 186398 
 
We delivered reftel talking points August 30 to the Spanish 
Agency for International Development and the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  Econoff received the official GOS response 
September 23 from Technical Advisor to the Secretary of State 
for International Cooperation Manuel Alhama Orenes.  Alhama 
said that colleagues working on Middle Eastern issues 
expressed great interest in the proposed International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) Small and Medium Enterprise 
facility.  He also noted that colleagues covering Iraq 
mentioned the urgent need for additional technical assistance 
for reconstruction projects to succeed in Iraq.  He promised 
that his agency would study the IFC proposal further, but 
stated that a decision could not be made at this time.  He 
also mentioned the difficulty of funding new projects at the 
end of the 2004 budget cycle.  Econoff questioned whether 
funds might be made available in 2005 considering that 
Spanish aid budgets will be increased.  Alhama answered that 
this might be a possibility, depending on the priorities in 
the new four year aid plan that will be announced on December 
Â¶1.  Embassy will continue to engage GOS on supporting the IFC 
facility.
