¶1.  U.S.-CHINA TRADE 
 
"Obama is not reliable" 
 
The official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (Zhongguo 
Qingnianbao)(09/17)(pg 2): "The special protection case on tires 
reflects the remarkable cultural differences between China and the 
United States.  Chinese experts were so optimistic about the case in 
August.  However, by putting their hope in President Obama, they 
essentially gave up the matter.  The U.S. President is not 
omnipotent.  Regardless of whether or not Obama wants to provoke 
China or whether or not he supports free trade, he could not reject 
the case due to the conservative protectionists among the 
Representatives on Capitol Hill, in the office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative, and the American Iron and Steel Association workers. 
 The Chinese people believed that since there have not been any 
major disputes between the two countries since Obama took office and 
the U.S. showed such great hospitality to China during the S&ED, it 
is only logical that Obama would oppose protectionist measures 
against China.  The case has exposed the two countries' different 
styles.  The U.S. has 'a tough, cowboy style' compared to China's 
more refined and cultured style, which puts courtesy before tough 
measures.  If China had started countervailing and anti-dumping 
investigations on U.S. products before Obama announced the 
[increased tire] tariffs, the result may have been different.  This 
reveals the nature of China, which is low-profile and leaves the 
door open to opponents.  However, the two countries' dispute over 
this case will not necessarily cause a trade war." 
 
¶2.  U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE STRATEGY 
 
"China is on U.S. intelligence department's black list" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/17)(pg 1): "Chinese expert Jin Canrong 
said that, by putting China on its intelligence black list, the U.S. 
is provoking conflict and poisoning the international atmosphere. 
Since the end of WWII, the U.S. has been arrogant and always seen 
itself as 'the big boss.'  Professor Shi Yinhong at People's 
University of China argued that although the U.S. listed China, 
Russia, North Korea, and Iran as 'potential challengers,' the U.S. 
knows very well that the threat China poses to the U.S. is small. 
The U.S. is not concerned about the current China, but rather 
China's ability to undermine the U.S. in the future.  The [National 
Intelligence Strategy] report showed that the U.S. has not yet given 
up its Cold War mentality.  Media outlets in some other Western 
countries, like the UK and Germany, have published similar reports 
hyping the cyber and espionage threat from China.  When Chinese 
media then fight back, Western media blames this on a rise in 
Chinese nationalism.  Jin Canrong added that such criticism from the 
U.S. could push China and Russia closer together.  If China and 
Russia were determined to fight against the U.S. together, the U.S. 
would be severely harmed." 
 
¶3.  TIBET 
 
"Obama sent henchman to find out about the Dalai Lama's real 
situation" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (09/17)(pg 3): "It 
is worth noting that two months before Obama's visit to China, he 
sent a delegation to visit the Dalai Lama's home.  Currently, there 
is still a lot of uncertainty about how Obama will deal with the 
Tibet issue.  The delegation's visit was labeled as 'private'; 
however, Obama's representative was the most senior U.S. official to 
meet the Dalai Lama since the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives met him last March.  'The henchman of Obama' will 
convey the President's respect to the Dalai Lama.  Obama is likely 
to adopt the middle road in dealing with the Dalai Lama: supporting 
him on the one hand, but not meeting him on the other.  However, 
even if Obama does not meet with the Dalai Lama, it does not mean 
that the U.S. has changed its policy on the Tibet issue.  The U.S. 
uses the Tibet issue to contain China."
