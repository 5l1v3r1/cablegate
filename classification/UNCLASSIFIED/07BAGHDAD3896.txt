SUBJECT: KUDOS AND THANKS FOR STATE'S PSD MOA NEGOTIATING 
TEAM 
 
 
The successful completion of negotiations between the Embassy 
and MNF-I on a Memorandum of Agreement governing Personal 
Security Contractors is a direct result of the hard work, 
commitment, and flexibility of both teams.  However, I want 
to express my deep appreciation for the outstanding 
contribution of the Embassy team: our own RSOs Ricardo Colon 
and Ted Carpenter, and our A/Legal Adviser Sam McDonald, and 
from DS, Jim McDermott and Jim Combs (DS/IP), Dean DeVilla 
(DS/OPO), and Jesse Tampio (DS/L).  Their achievement is a 
testament to their professionalism and skill as negotiators 
and to their interpersonal skills as a cohesive team.  Thank 
you for giving us the best.
