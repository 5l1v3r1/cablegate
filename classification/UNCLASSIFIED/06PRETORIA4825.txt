SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA PUBLICLY CONFIRMS MBEKI-BUSH MEETING 
 
¶1. (U) Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad yesterday confirmed 
to reporters that President Mbeki will be meeting President 
Bush at the White House on 8 December.  Pahad admitted that 
the agenda has not been finalized, but added that free trade 
negotiations will inevitably be on the agenda as well as the 
threat of terrorism.  In both areas, South Africa has "no 
major problems (with the United States)...just differences." 
He also said that South Africa's relations with the United 
States were good, despite differences of opinion on the 
Middle East and the need for greater multilateralism in world 
affairs. 
 
¶2. (U) Regarding the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), Pahad told 
reporters that South Africa cannot afford to sign an 
"asymmetrical" free trade agreement.  Pahad added that 
Beijing is easier to deal with (than the United States) 
because "the Chinese leadership has made it clear that they 
understand they cannot sustain a relationship based on 
colonial relations."  He went on to list the billions of 
dollars that China has set aside to enhance trade relations 
with the African continent as proof.  Pahad pointed out, 
however, that the Department of Trade and Industry will 
continue talks in an effort to look for other ways to 
strengthen economic relations with the U.S. if a free trade 
agreement is not signed in the near-future.
