¶1.  (SBU) POLOFF delivered REF comments September 3 to Nineta 
Barbalescu, Director of the MFA Directorate for OCSE, Asymmetric 
Threats and Nonproliferation.  Barbalescu said Romania agreed that 
Iran, and to some extent Syria, would attempt to use procedural 
issues to prolong debates and in effect filibuster the IAEA Board of 
Governors meeting.   Romania was in the process of preparing remarks 
regarding the last several DG reports, and all EU member states 
supported a firm approach.  While some concern was expressed within 
the EU that antagonizing Iran without a clear endgame would only 
lead Iran to withdraw completely from the IAEA, Barbalescu agreed 
that Iran had played this game for years and was unlikely to take so 
dramatic a step. 
¶2. (SBU)  Barbalescu asked POLOFF whether the U.S. language would be 
even stronger than in the past.  POLOFF responded that our demarche 
to IAEA partners reflected both U.S. intent to deliver a strong 
message at the Board of Governors meeting and our commitment to hold 
Iran and Syria to their IAEA obligations.   Barbelescu also inquired 
as to the level and composition of the U.S. delegation to the 
meeting.
