SUBJECT: OPIC-SUPPORTED INVESTMENT FUND IN THE REGION 
 
REF: STATE 7796 
 
¶1. (U)  Post appreciates the opportunity to comment on OPIC's 
proposed support for the Euro MENA fund.  There is increasing 
activity in the venture capital field in Morocco, and indeed 
the Financial Services Volunteer Corps (FSVC) is helping a 
Moroccan partner organize a roundtable on the subject in 
March to discuss draft Moroccan legislation to regulate the 
sector. 
 
¶2. (U) Post believes the proposed fund is compatible with 
Morocco's economic program and would bring valuable 
competition to the market in its proposed transaction range. 
While some funding is available, there have not been that 
many investments of this size or type.  We stand ready extend 
any appropriate assistance to fund managers as they 
inaugurate their activities here.
