Title- The Fund and the Crisis 
 
Editorial in liberal A Folha de S. Paulo (3-22) says: "In talks to 
prepare for the G-20 Summit of heads of states.....proposals to 
reform multilateral financial institutions were a stand out 
[item]t....given the urgency of the aid there is no sense in the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) subjecting its financings to 
draconian demands in fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies, as 
it used to.  There is not a 'moral' reason to proceed like this, 
when the U.S. is willing to increase its debt and its fiscal deficit 
as much as it thinks is necessary to fight recession." 
 
Title- Sasha`s Dad Speaking 
 
Op-Ed in liberal A Folha de S. Paulo (3-22) by Clovis Rossi states: 
"...The dramatic change in tone in relations with Iran impresses but 
it is not what stands out the most, at least to me [Clovis Rossi]. 
The tone is what is absolutely new.  Obama showed a humbleness and 
respect that are not usual in U.S. presidents....For a U.S. 
president to abandon the preachy tone his predecessors used to have 
with the world may pave avenues of consequences and dimensions hard 
to anticipate."
