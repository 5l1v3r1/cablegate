FUTURE OF THE PEACE PROCESS:  OBAMA VS. MCCAIN 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam continue reporting on Palestinian Authority 
President Abbas' visit to the White House.  The front page stories 
highlight statements by Abbas that, "the last meeting with the U.S. 
President was positive."  Abbas continues, "[Bush] expressed his 
wish to establish a Palestinian state by the end of this year... If 
the conditions for peace are present, an agreement can be reached 
with Israel in two days... We hope that the latest statements by the 
Israeli Premier will be considered a down-payment for [progress in 
negotiations with] the incoming Israeli Government."  Al Ayyam also 
reports that PLO negotiator Sa'eb Erekat confirmed that President 
Bush will not blame any party if an agreement is not reached between 
Israel and the Palestinians by the end of the year. 
 
The upcoming Quartet meeting is front page news in the dailies. 
Reports note that the Quartet will meet with representatives of the 
Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams to discuss the status of 
peace talks.  The papers also highlight the Quartet announcement 
that a peace conference will be held in Moscow next spring. 
 
The U.S. provision of F35 fighter jets to Israel makes headlines in 
Al Quds and the on-line Maan network.  Quoting Israeli daily Maariv, 
reporting includes statements from the Pentagon calling the deal an 
important step in safeguarding American national interests and 
sustaining Israeli supremacy.  The U.S. Department of Defense is 
also quoted confirming that it will prohibit the sale of cluster 
bombs.  Al Quds comments that similar statements were made by the 
U.S. military after 14 civilians in Lebanon were killed by cluster 
bombs during the first Lebanon war.  The paper also reminds readers 
that the Israeli military has previously asserted that the use of 
cluster bombs allowed under international law and that cluster bombs 
were used in the second Lebanon war. 
 
Al Quds' Washington correspondent writes a front page story about 
the financial crisis in the United States.  The story outlines 
actions taken by Congress and presidential hopefuls.  The reporter 
comments that the bail-out plan is not popular among average 
Americans who believe that it aims to rescue companies whose greed 
and unchecked misbehavior contributed to the current catastrophe in 
the American economy.  Americans also believe that the plan does not 
directly address the problems of Americans who have lost their homes 
or are facing foreclosure, the article concludes. 
 
Al Ayyam newspaper and Wafa report that Palestinian Authority (PA) 
President Abbas is satisfied with Egyptian efforts to achieve 
internal Palestinian reconciliation. Al Ayyam's front page story 
also quotes PA Presidential spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudayna stating 
that, "President Abbas and the Palestinian leadership trust Egyptian 
efforts aimed at achieving Palestinian national unity by ensuring a 
sustained calm, an end to the siege on the Palestinian people, and 
support for the Palestinian pursuit of legitimate rights to 
statehood based on the 1967 [borders]."  Wafa quotes chief 
Palestinian negotiator Ahmad Quray denying recent reports that he 
questioned the success of Egyptian efforts and accused some Arab 
parties of causing the Palestinian rift.  Quray is quoted as saying 
that he trusts the sincere Egyptian efforts to support Palestinian 
rights and unity. 
 
Hamas warnings of a severe fuel shortage in Gaza grab front page 
headlines in Al Quds.  The paper quotes Ahmad Ali of the Hamas 
"Palestinian Petroleum Department" in Gaza stating that this winter 
could see a severe fuel shortage when demand will increase for fuel. 
 
JERUSALEM 00001833  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
 Ahmad is quoted stating, "although the Israelis have allowed for a 
very slight increase in the fuel supply to Gaza, the citizens will 
suffer because of the increased demand... current quantities of fuel 
supplied to Gaza constitute only one third of the actual needs for 
fuel for citizens." 
 
Israeli warnings of a rise in violence perpetrated by Israeli 
settlers are front page news in Al Ayyam.  Quoting Israeli daily 
Haaretz, the paper publishes comments by the head of the Israeli 
Defense Forces' Central Command confirming the increase in violence 
and warning that it threatens the Israeli military's ability to 
conduct operations in the West Bank.  The official calls the 
increase a "dangerous phenomenon" that is causing significant damage 
to the image of the IDF and the state of Israel. 
 
Al Ayyam's front page highlights comments by Israeli university 
professor Sternhell who was injured last week by a bomb planted at 
his home.  The paper reports that Sternhell addressed a group of 
supporters who were staging a rally in front of his home against 
violence perpetrated by right-wing Israeli groups.  The report 
highlights his comment that violence by Israelis against 
Palestinians will eventually be answered with violence against 
Israelis. 
 
Headlines note that French Foreign Minister Kouchner will visit the 
Palestinian Territories on October 3 to discuss the status of peace 
talks with Israel.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1.  Regular columnist Mohamad Yaghy opined in Al Ayyam under the 
title, "The peace process in the American elections" (10/03): 
"[T]he differences between the positions of the American 
presidential candidates regarding the [Palestinian-Israeli] peace 
process is somewhat unclear ....both of them have expressed more 
than once, their strong support of Israel and their belief that 
Jerusalem must remain the united capital of Israel.....although the 
differences are not clear, Obama's policies seem to be more defined 
and ready to deal with the Israeli-Arab conflict.  We see this from 
his list of advisors... McCain's policy, on the other hand, is not 
defined and is more likely to [halt] the peace process, which would 
even mean a break with President Bush's policy ...  Nonetheless, 
there are Arabs who support McCain, why?  Firstly, because some 
Arabs... are more racist than many Americans and would prefer to 
receive instructions from a white American leader... Secondly, 
McCain has promised some Arabs, or so they think, that he will wage 
war against Iran and rid them of the deadly Shiite danger..." 
 
¶2.  Columnist Rajab Abu Sarraya opined in Al Ayyam under the title: 
"Reconciliation is better"(10/02):  "[T]he Arab League should not be 
alone in raising its finger against those obstructing national 
unity, national personalities should also.  It is high time to 
loudly speak out against oppressive Palestinian powers, especially 
ones that are shielded behind arms, their weapons trained on the 
heads and chests of Palestinians... anyone who cannot find a place 
in their political program for difference [of opinion] will not find 
a place among Palestinians and possibly not even among Arabs and 
regional states... He who does not have legitimacy should worry... 
military might will fade away."
