Cuba, Again 
 
Op-Ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (3-12) by Kenneth Maxwell states: 
"...What is actually happening in Cuba?  There are three 
developments worthy of note.  The first is that Raul [Castro] is 
consolidating his power...The second one is the need of reforms. 
Venezuela's benevolence proved itself crucial for Cuba but it might 
not last.....The third one is the potential for progress in the long 
cold war between the U.S. and Cuba ...But although there are changes 
underway in Cuba, and despite the fact that many Americans are tired 
of the impasse, in the U.S. a new indication of how much 
Washington's policy towards Cuba remains captive to worries about 
internal policies- these have resurfaced." 
 
Crisis, trade and emerging countries guilt 
 
Op-Ed in business oriented Valor Econtmico (3-12) by journalist 
Maria Clara do Prado says: "....The crisis took away with it a 
series of financial assets derived from the developed world's cheap 
liquidity, fed in great part by resources generated in emerging 
country economies.....with this process' meltdown, the entire world 
got poorer and the less wealthy countries such as Brazil got back to 
their real dimensions.....If the U.S. does not start to buy  - there 
is a fear that the money released by [President Barack] Obama will 
go to savings and not to consumption  -  and if Europe continues to 
be immersed in apathy  (with increasing problems in the Eastern 
economies), the world's trade will remain trapped."
