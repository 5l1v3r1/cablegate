Â¶1. On December 6, Charge approached Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Permanent Secretary Patricia Rodgers deliver demarche 
on the UNHRC Special Session on Sudan.  After reviewing the 
U.S. points and looking into the issue, Rodgers informed 
Charge that The Bahamas would not be represented in Geneva 
and therefore would not be in a position to co-sponsor the 
Finnish resolution.  Charge used the opportunity to raise 
larger issues of The Bahamas' voting patterns in the United 
Nations on human rights issues.  Noting the discrepancy 
between The Bahamas' strong respect for human rights and its 
UN voting pattern of neutrality, he urged The Bahamas to take 
a more active role in addressing international human rights 
concerns within the UN.
