SUBJECT: UN GENERAL DEBATE BEGINS: OVER 100 HEADS OF STATE 
AND GOVERNMENT PARTICIPATE 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: Over 100 heads of state and government 
participated in this year's United Nations General Debate, 
which opened on September 23, including President Obama for 
his first Assembly appearance. Most interventions addressed 
the economic impact of the financial crisis, nuclear 
disarmament and climate change.  UN reform was another common 
theme with many expressing support for enlarging the Security 
Council.  Latin American countries supported Honduran 
President Zeleya's return to office.  The following spoke: UN 
Secretary general Ban Ki-Moon, President of the General 
Assembly Dr. Treki (Libyan), Brazil, United States, Libya, 
Uganda, Qatar, Turkmenistan, Uruguay, Chile, Algeria, 
Republic of Korea and France.  Full text of statements 
available on at www.un.org/ga/64/generaldebate; video 
archives are at www.un.org/webcast/2009.html.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon preceded the General Debate 
to present his "Report on the work of the 
Organization"(A/64/1) calling for greater global engagement, 
confronting climate change, nuclear non-proliferation and 
combating the effects of the global economic crisis. 
President of the General Assembly Ali Treki (Libya) took the 
liberty to echo Bon's remarks during a 30 minute statement. 
He also addressed UN reform, climate change, development in 
Africa, human rights and the question of Palestine. 
 
¶3. Brazilian President Lula de Silva addressed the economic 
crisis, "the lack of a stable, representative world 
governance", and climate change.  He called for more 
regulation of the global economy and reforms of the 
International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He advocated a 
reformed Security Council that was "open to new permanent 
members."  He spoke of Brazil's work in bio-fuels and its 
commitment to reducing greenhouse gases.  He called for 
ousted President Zeleya's return to Honduras. 
 
¶4. President Obama's address emphasized United States 
reengagement with multilateral institutions to confront the 
world's problems.  He stated that for too long, opposition to 
United States policies was reason for inaction. He challenged 
member states to take action and not blame the United States 
for inaction.  He addressed nuclear non-proliferation and 
climate change, and announced a re-launching of negotiations 
to settle Israel-Palestine issues.  Full text of statement 
available at www.un.org/ga/64/generaldebate/pdf/US en.pdf 
 
¶5. In a rambling one hour and thirty-six minute speech Libyan 
President Qadhafi, spoke about his desire to change all 
aspects of the United Nations.  The common charge was the 
oppression of the many by those in the Security Council with 
veto powers.  He railed against the power of the Security 
Council (calling it the "Terrorist Council"), advocating 
early in the speech for its dissolution, yet later pushed for 
more permanent seats (with veto) for multiple countries and 
regional bodies.  He also urged the General Assembly no 
longer recognize Security Council resolutions.  He touched on 
reparations for African countries, the International Criminal 
Court, the International Atomic Energy Agency, investigations 
of wars and assassinations, and advocated moving the United 
Nations out of New York.  His speech was chaotic, including 
ripping up the United Nations Charter and throwing documents 
off of the podium in awkward theatrics to prove his point. 
 
¶6. France: President Sarkozy spoke at length on the economic 
crisis, saying that people cannot continue to live without 
hope and arguing that the International Monetary Fund and 
World Bank should be reformed.  He insisted that a 
multi-polar world should not operate with a single (reserve) 
currency, that technology should be shared internationally 
(if necessary, funded by taxing excess profits and 
speculation) and that tax havens should be shut down.   He 
advocated for a world environment organization, stating that 
"free trade should not impose its will."  He warned Iran that 
it should not count on "passive reaction" from the 
international community regarding its nuclear ambitions.  On 
Security Council reform, he advocated the increase in 
permanent and non-permanent seats, noting it was 
"unacceptable" that Africa, Brazil, India, Japan and Germany 
were excluded. 
 
¶7. Ugandan President Museveni echoed Libyan calls for an

African seat on the Security Council and spoke about economic 
issues affecting his country.  Qatar's Amir Sheik Khalifa 
Al-Thani called on the UN to work towards peace - especially 
in Israel and Palestine - and supported climate change goals. 
 Turkmenistan President Berdimuhamedov supported reform of 
the UN and spoke about issues effecting 
Central Asia.  Chile and Uruguay both addressed the political 
issues in Honduras, Chilean President Bachelet supporting the 
San Jose Agreement and Uruguayan President Vazquez calling 
for a return of the "constitutional order."  Vazquez also 
emphasized Uruguayan opposition to the Cuban embargo. 
Algerian President Bouteflika addressed the economic crisis 
and also perceived a "double standard" in issues of 
non-proliferation and human rights.  Korean President 
Myung-bak stated his desire for a nuclear free Korean 
peninsula and more dialogue, within the six-party talks, with 
the DPRK.
