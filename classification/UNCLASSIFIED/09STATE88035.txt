SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-LICENSE/PRE-SHIPMENT 
END-USE CHECK ON LICENSES 050171347 AND 050172400 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 4 - 5. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-license/pre-shipment check on licenses 050171347 and 
050172400 for the export of rifles and night vision to 
Georgia.  Post is requested to complete this Blue Lantern 
check within 45 days. Lack of response to a Blue Lantern 
check will affect pending and future licenses involving 
parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: The rifles and night vision listed 
below are particularly sensitive defense articles.  Foreign 
intermediate consignee RPA Port Aviation had never been party 
to a U.S. export license until May 2009, at which time the 
company appeared on five licenses for ultimate end-use in 
Georgia.  This check is to establish the bona fides of these 
transactions and RPA Port Aviation. 
 
¶4. Action Request Tbilisi:  Post is requested to establish 
the bona fides of these transactions by making inquiries to 
representatives of the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
 The following points are included for guidance: 
 
(To Ministry of Internal Affairs) 
 
--Can you confirm that MOIA has ordered the defense articles 
listed below? 
 
--What role is RPA Port Aviation playing in these 
transactions?  What services has the company provided?  What 
fees or commissions have you paid the company? 
 
In its reply, Post is encouraged to comment on any 
information pertinent to this transaction such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved. 
 
¶5. Action Request Tel Aviv:  Post is requested to establish 
the bona fides of RPA Port Aviation by making inquiries to 
representatives of the company. 
 
(To RPA Port Aviation) 
 
--When was your company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What products and services does your company provide?  Who 
are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
--What are your annual sales of U.S.-origin defense articles? 
 
--What is your role in these transactions?  What fees and 
commissions will you receive for your services in these 
transactions? 
 
--Will you ever have physical possession of these defense 
articles? 
 
--Have you had a previous business relationship with the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs or any other agency of the 
Government of Georgia?  Have you had a previous business 
relationship with U.S. company Falcon Defense? 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the 
brokering of U.S.-origin defense articles?  Are you familiar 
with the regulations governing the brokering of U.S.-origin 
defense articles, including restrictions on re-transfer or 
re-export? 
 
In its reply, Post is encouraged to comment on any 
information pertinent to this transaction such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
