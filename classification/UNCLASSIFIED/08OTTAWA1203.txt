SUBJECT: AVIAN FLU CONFERENCE IN EGYPT: CANADA WILL ATTEND, BUT 
MINISTER UNLIKELY 
 
REF: STATE 92335 
 
Canadian officials will attend the Ministerial Conference on Avian 
and Pandemic Influenza hosted by Egypt on October 24 - 25. Bersabel 
Ephrem, Director General for International Affairs at Health Canada, 
and William Horne from the Secretariat for the Pandemic Influenza 
Preparedness Committee at the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade will represent Canada. A representative from the 
Canadian International Development Agency may also participate. 
According to Horne, Minister of Health Tony Clement, had planned to 
attend, but the Canadian federal election (with voting on October 
14) has put that in doubt, at least until election results are in. 
Canada is still investigating the possibility of a pledge, although 
the election also makes it difficult to predict its likelihood.
