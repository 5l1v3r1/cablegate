SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 051009880 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on license 051009880 for the 
export of night vision goggles (NVGs) to 
New Zealand.  Post is requested to complete this Blue Lantern 
check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern 
check will affect pending and future licenses involving 
parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Due to the sensitivity of the 
equipment and the potential for their diversion or misuse, 
the Department of State and the Department of Defense have 
policies of carefully scrutinizing NVG export licenses and 
taking steps to ensure proper end-use.  Provisos attached 
to these licenses obligate the end-user to secure the NVGs 
from loss, theft, or unauthorized access, and to perform 
routine inventory checks by serial number.  These records 
are to be made available for review upon US Government 
request. 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Post is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate officials 
to confirm continued possession by Central South Island 
Helicopters (CSIH) of 
the NVGs, to determine the serial numbers of the NVGs, and 
to verify that the NVGs are secure and being used only for 
the purpose stated on the license; and to verify, as 
stipulated by license proviso number 1, that the use of the 
NVGs are for search and rescue (SAR) and emergency medical 
service (EMS) operations for the Government of 
New Zealand Agencies ONLY; and finally, to confirm the 
existence of a valid contract between CSIH and the GONZ 
for said operations.  Department requests 
that post conduct a site visit, if possible, in order to 
gather and verify this information.  If a site visit is 
not possible, please obtain official written confirmation 
of receipt and possession and inform PM/DTCC case officer.
