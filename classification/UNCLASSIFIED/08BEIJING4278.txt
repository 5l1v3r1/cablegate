U.S. DIPLOMACY 
 
a. "Bush becomes the scapegoat of the U.S." 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/20): "A new Hollywood film, 'W', has 
recently been shown in the U.S. It is the story of President Bush. 
Some people are saying that no one could have been a worse president 
than Bush. However, others disagree. Many Americans defend Bush, 
suggesting that the current difficulties in the U.S. are the 
necessary result of the U.S.'s behavior globally promoting American 
ideology and hegemony. Bush simply happened to become the person who 
will take the blame for the U.S.'s decline. A Chinese expert on 
international affairs, Charles Freeman indicated that in fact it is 
not fair to give all the blame to the President.  Although the U.S. 
implies separation of powers, it advocates individual heroism. The 
U.S. president has a big influence on domestic and foreign affairs. 
Therefore he takes the most blame. In fact, the U.S.-China 
relationship can be counted as one of Bush's successes during his 
post. Bush has brought forth the 'stakeholder' concept in China. 
Another important legacy of Bush is that he has ensured an open 
market and a free trade, globalizing the U.S." 
 
b. "Moral superiority harms the U.S." 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/20): "Obama's victory in the election has 
re-united the American people, and given them hope, strengthening 
their moral superiority. Some experts think that the U.S. soft power 
will resume because of Obama's mild diplomatic style. However, 
American's moral superiority has not disappeared. On the contrary it 
has been strengthened. The U.S. is telling the World that 'see, we 
have elected an African American president. Which one of you is able 
to achieve this?' The greedy nature of capitalism, the need for the 
expansion of national interests and the impulse to spread the 
religion of Jesus has made the U.S. accustomed to treating other 
countries like pupils. This habit brings the U.S. three flaws: 
first, the U.S. is the only judge capable of judging right and 
wrong. Second, the U.S. steps from judging right and wrong to 
hegemonic expansion. Third, the U.S. is trapped in a weird circle of 
'defensive expansion'; the more resistance it encounters from other 
countries, the more unsafe the U.S. feels. ...Actually the most 
important change that the U.S. needs to make is to walk away from 
moral superiority and learn to get along with the World, modestly 
and equally."
