SUBJECT: TEST MESSAGE FOR CX UPGRADE 
 
 
¶1.  This telegram is a test of the new CableXpress upgrade. 
Most of the changes are minor, yet necessary for the upcoming 
GITM upgrade. You should receive 2 copies of this telegram, 1 
outbound comeback copy and 1 inbound from the server in 
Washington. This shows that the upgrade was successful. 
 
¶2.  The biggest change for users is that forwarded telegrams 
from the users are now in MS Word format instead of the 
notepad format, and that the telegrams font size is slightly 
larger. 
 
¶3.  If you have any errors or problems please contact the IPC 
and thank you.
