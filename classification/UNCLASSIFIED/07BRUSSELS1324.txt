SUBJECT: BELGIUM: HIGHEST COURT QUASHES DHKP-C VERDICT 
 
 
¶1.  Belgium's highest court, the Cour de Cassation, on April 19 
quashed the November 7 ruling of the Ghent Appellate Court 
imposing stiffer sentences on three convicted DHKP-C militants, 
and confirming the sentences handed down by a lower court in 
Bruges in February 2006 to four other DHKP-C militants.  The seven 
were convicted of belonging to a criminal and terrorist 
organization, arms possession, and the use of forged documents. 
The Court ordered the immediate release of four of the convicts 
currently serving time.  Belgium's government has not commented on 
what steps it will or can take next. 
 
¶2.  Last year, the Ghent Appellate Court identified Dursun 
Karatas, the secretary-general of the DHKP-C in Belgium, as 
belonging to a criminal and terrorist organization and sentenced 
him to an additional year in prison.  Musa Asoglu was identified 
as a leader of a terrorist organization and the Ghent appeals 
judge imposed seven years imprisonment, instead of the six years 
he had received from the court in Bruges.  Bahar Kimyongur, the 
DHKP-C spokesman for Belgium, was given five years. 
 
¶3.  The Ghent Appellate Court judge upheld the verdicts concerning 
the other defendants, who received four years each.  Fehriye 
Erdal's sentence remained unchanged.  Erdal managed to escape 
before her sentence could be imposed and is still on the run. 
 
¶4.  In rendering its verdict, the Cour de Cassation argued that 
the February 2006 appointment of a judge from another jurisdiction 
was a serious procedural error.  This mistake prejudiced the 
court's ruling on the case.
