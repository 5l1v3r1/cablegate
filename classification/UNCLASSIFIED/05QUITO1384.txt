¶1.  PolOff met with MFA Human Rights Director Carmen Larrea 
on June 13, who said the GOE had no programs to support 
democracy and human rights in Cuba.  She said the GOE lacks 
sufficient resources to look into such issues. 
 
¶2.  We have no specific information on Ecuadorian investments 
in Cuba.  The Commerce Attache called several contacts, who 
had no knowledge of any direct investment in Cuba.  He 
reported that Ecuador exports $8.6 million of petroleum to 
Cuba, over half of the $14.8 million in total exports.
