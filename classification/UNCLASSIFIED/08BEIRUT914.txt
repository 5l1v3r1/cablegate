SUBJECT:  Lebanon: Special Media Reaction: Secretary Rice's 
Visit to Lebanon, June 20, 2008 
 
Atmospherics:

Despite the press' preoccupation with the complexities blocking 
formation of the government, the media continued to give top billing 
to the Shebaa Farms issue.  The press underscored that it is not 
only the subject of American interest but international and Arab 
interest as well.  The press observed that the French President will 
discuss Shebaa Farms during his upcoming visit to Israel on Sunday, 
and noted that President Mubarak intends to discuss it as well with 
Israeli Prime Minister Olmert when they meet next week in Sharm 
El-Sheikh.  Several newspapers also front-paged the meeting that 
took place between Secretary Rice and U.N. Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon, claiming that she gave him "the green light" to begin 
working on this issue. 
 
In this same context, most media outlets emphasized Hizballah's 
reaction to this "sudden" interest in the Shebaa Farms.  The press 
noted in particular a statement by one Hizballah MP who said that 
"getting the Shebaa Farms back from the Zionist occupation will not 
change the existing formula...which is Lebanon's need for the 
Resistance. ... Those who think that placing the Shebaa Farms under 
an international umbrella could put the Resistance uder 
pressure...are delusional."

"No Israeli Seriousness and American Naivety," an editorial by 
Sarkis Naoum in moderate, anti-Syrian An-Nahar (6/20): 
 
"...It is good that President Suleiman said in his inauguration 
speech that he intends to exert every effort possible to liberate 
the Shebaa Farms. ...It is also good that he told the delegations 
who came to congratulate him, that he has additional documents that 
prove the Lebanese ownership of the Shebaa Farms.   ...As is known, 
Suleiman raised the issue of the Shebaa Farms before Secretary 
Rice's surprising visit.  ...For this reason he was able to talk 
with her about this issue with clarity and frankness. ...In this 
regard, News reports noted that Secretary Rice and her team do not 
have confidence in the U.N. and do not want to place the Shebaa 
Farms under UN patronage, but are adamant about finding a way to 
liberate these Farms.  ...It is believed that such an attitude is 
not helpful and has no value because Secretary Rice and her 
Administration are leaving their posts soon.  ...Olmert is also 
leaving...and Israel and the U.S. are going to be engrossed with 
elections.  In such atmospheres, there will be 
no Israeli concessions and no U.S. decisions..." 
 
"Qoureitem: Should We Refuse Israeli Withdrawal from the Shebaa 
Farms to Avoid being Labeled as Conspiring against the Resistance?" 
an editorial by Imad Marmal in Arab nationalist As-Safir (6/20): 
 
"...Sources who commented about this new enthusiasm related to 
liberation of the Shebaa Farms said that Mr. Eliot Abrams, in 
coordination with the strategic planning office at the State 
Department, brought the issue of the Shebaa Farms to the 
surface...because this issue might be the only one the Bush 
Administration would be able to solve before it leaves.  ...Circles 
close to MP Hariri, however, noted that a lot that was said about 
Secretary Rice's visit was pure imagination.  ...They noted that 
Secretary Rice only said that her Administration is serious in 
trying to end the Israeli occupation of the Shebaa Fams.  Rice told 
Hariri, 'you have been asking for three years for the Shebaa 
Farms...but this time, we are the ones who are asking about this 
issue and President Bush also discussed it with the Lebanese 
Ambassador to Washington.'  Hariri responded by noting that the 
issue of the Lebanese prisoners should be dealt with as well. 
...Hariri circles wondered over statements that claim that efforts 
to get Israel to withdraw from the Shebaa farms reflect bad intentions 
towards Hizballah...  These sources asked, if Israel decides to 
withdraw...do we ask her to stay in Shebaa to avoid being labeled as 
conspiring against the Resistance? ..."
