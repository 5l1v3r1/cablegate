SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT REPORTER ARRESTED UNDER AIPPA; HARARE 
 
 
Independent "Daily News" reporter, Chris Gande, was on 
July 4 charged under the Access to Information and 
Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) for allegedly writing a 
false story.  Gande becomes the 13th reporter to be charged 
under the Act, enacted in March this year.  Last week the 
"Daily News" carried an article by Gande in which he 
reported that the government had "snubbed" the family of 
the late vice-president Joshua Nkomo by "neither inviting 
nor informing them" of the preparations for a state-funded 
commemorative gala in his honor.  Gande is standing by his 
story as a true reflection of what Nkomo's eldest daughter, 
Thandi, told him in an interview on the eve of the memorial 
revelry held in Mutare.  Johanna MaFuyana, Nkomo's widow, 
attended the gala that was televised live on June 29.  She 
was, however, flown to Mutare on a military helicopter on 
the day the "Daily News" story was published (June 28).
