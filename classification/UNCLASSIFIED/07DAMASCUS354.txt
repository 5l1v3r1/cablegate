------------------------------ 
 
"Four Years of US Occupation" 
 
------------------------------ 
 
Isam Dari, Chief Editor of government-owned Tishrin, wrote (4/12): 
"US occupiers, despite their tremendous power and destructive 
weapons, failed to break the will of the Iraqi people, who swore to 
engage in resistance and confrontation until the occupation has been 
defeated and the flag of freedom has returned to fly over all of 
Iraq.... 
 
"Iraqis and Americans are paying a heavy price for the war in 
Iraq.... Though Americans are paying a dear price, US merchants of 
US and colonialist schemes are threatening Iran.... 
 
"The war decision is easy to make, but the decision to stop the war 
or to prevail in it is extremely difficult, if not impossible.... 
 
"It is strange that decision-makers in the White House do not learn 
from the experiences of the past.  What is even more surprising is 
that they do not listen to advice from sensible Americans.  The only 
language they master is the language of steel and fire, even if the 
fire burns the American people themselves.... 
 
"The past four years have not only been years of fire, blood, and 
destruction, but also years when masks fell and lies were exposed, 
with the Bush administration appearing exactly as naked as it is. 
 
"We do not think the ideology of neoconservatives will let them 
admit their mistakes and sins.  We do not think they will change 
their Hitlerian policy.  But we believe they have failed, and will 
fail in the future.  They took their first, and last, chance.  It is 
now up to the American people to decide, and we leave accountability 
to history." 
 
------------ 
 
"First Step" 
 
------------ 
 
Khalid al-Ashhab, a commentator in government-owned Al-Thawra, said 
(4/12):  "The initial results of the new US strategy in Iraq show 
nothing other than a new and additional expansion of the quagmire in 
which the American occupation is sinking.... 
 
"Visits by US Congressional delegations are another face of US 
policy that must be put on the right path.... 
 
"The American dialogue with Iraq's neighbors, particularly Syria, is 
only the first step on a road that the Bush administration has made 
long, a first step in the cleaning of a picture that has showed the 
American face as ugly - indeed, extremely ugly." 
 
---------------------- 
 
"Justifying Sanctions" 
 
---------------------- 
 
Mihriz al-Ali, a commentator in government-owned Al-Thawrah, wrote 
(4/12):  "The United States, which in the biggest act of deception 
against American and world public opinion, invaded Iraq under the 
pretext of its possession of weapons of mass destruction, is now 
repeating the same tactics, deluding the world into thinking that 
the Iranian nuclear program is a threat and increasing international 
pressure on Iran in order to justify its strategy toward Tehran.... 
 
"Washington keeps silent on Israel's nuclear arsenal.... If the 
United States is really interested in world peace and security, it 
must call for a nuclear free Middle East...."
