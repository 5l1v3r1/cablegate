¶9. Travelers with private or U.S. Government (USG) owned

before these items can be allowed into Embassy facilities. 
Classified computers must be sent to post via the classified 
diplomatic pouch, or be hand carried by a non-professional 
diplomatic courier.  All classified equipment must bear 
external USG bar-coded inventory numbers and classification 
marking commensurate with the highest level of information 
processed on the system.  Cellular/mobile phones and 
palm-pilots are prohibited in Controlled Access Areas. 
Questions concerning other types of electronic devices and 
magnetic media may be directed to the ISSO or RSO. 
Electricity in Tunisia is 220 Volts. 
 
¶11. Security/Crime Information: Tunisia is a moderate Arab 
country that has traditionally enjoyed peace and stability. 
However, in light of the September 11 attacks in the United 
States and in view of the ongoing violence in Israel, the 
West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere in the Middle East region, the 
American Embassy reminds visitors to maintain a high level of 
 
vigilance and to take appropriate steps to increase their 
security awareness.  While the Government of Tunisia has and 
will continue to make every effort to protect foreigners, 
visitors should avoid large crowds and crowded public areas 
and keep in regular contact with the Embassy. 
 
¶12. Tunisian security forces are omnipresent and generally 
ensure public order.  Low level, non-violent property crimes 
of opportunity are relatively common.  Pickpockets and 
purse-snatchers are common in areas with high volume tourist 
traffic, such as the Tunis Medina (old city) and central 
market.  It is prudent to exercise normal travel security 
precautions and maintain a low profile as one would in any 
major U.S. city.  This should help to ensure an incident-free 
visit.
