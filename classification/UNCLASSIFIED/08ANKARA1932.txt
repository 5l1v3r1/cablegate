 In Today's Papers 
 
Obama's Victory and the Challenges 
Some media outlets continue to praise the inspiration Obama's 
victory has brought to the world.  Mainstream Hurriyet carries the 
headline, "Love for Obamerica," and reports, "Obama has spread 
inspiration all over the world," as "the winds of change have spread 
from Africa to Australia and the question becomes: will there be an 
Aborignal prime minister in Australia some day?  A Turkish prime 
minister in Germany? Or even in Turkey, could a Kurd become 
president?"  Islamist oriented Yeni Safak reports, "Obama's victory 
in America has started blowing the winds of courage for freedom 
throughout the world." 
 
While others note the distinct challenges the President-elect faces. 
 Islamist-oriented Zaman reports, "The first news for Obama from 
Afghanistan is 'a civilian massacre,'" as "23 children and 10 women 
were killed by an American air strike in Afghanistan." 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports, "Russia took new steps 
yesterday against the U.S. missile shield."  Zaman also reports, 
"PKK leaders Murat Karayilan and Zubeyir Aydar have joined the names 
of those who have sent letters of congratulations to the new U.S. 
President. "  In their letter, published "on a web site that is 
close to the terrorist organization," the leaders "criticize the 
Bush administration for calling the PKK a terrorist organization," 
and "call for a solution to the Kurdish problem."  Yasin Dogan of 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak writes, "Obama's new policies in Iraq 
will affect Turkey," for instance, "A U.S. withdrawal from Iraq 
could bring the Iraqi Kurds and Turkey closer together."  Mainstream 
Milliyet reports President-elect Obama "Is Taking Over the Wreckage" 
of the American economy and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Meanwhile, mainstream Sabah writes "CHP leader Baykal believes there 
would be a serious change in the moderate Islam policies of the 
US." 
 
In a related story, liberal Radikal interprets Iranian President 
Ahmedinejad's congratulations to Obama on his victory as 'a rare 
praise,' noting it is the first time since Iran's 1979 Islamic 
revolution that such a message has been communicated. 
 
Editorial opinion on President Elect Barack Obama 
Murat Yetkin wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal: "There is a 
serious risk of increased tension in troubled areas of the world 
until Barack Obama takes charge.  Moreover, many of these troubled 
areas are in Turkey's neighborhood.  The UN mandate in Iraq will 
expire and unless Iraqi parliament signs a security agreement with 
the United States before January, the US may leave.  A new UNSC 
resolution on this matter would most probably face a Russian veto. 
The situation in Afghanistan is worsening with every passing day. 
Uncertainty in Pakistan is also an immediate problem. Turkey should 
think of ways to turn these risks into opportunities before January 
20." 
 
Muharrem Sarikaya wrote in mainstream Sabah:  "The Italian Foreign 
Minister questioned 'Will Obama be a hope for Turkey's EU process or 
will he be a problem in resolving many regional issues, including 
the Armenian issue?'  It's a good idea to look at previous Democrat 
administrations in the US to find the right answer to this question. 
  The most recent example is Clinton who, together with his party, 
played a significant role in Turkey's EU process and in resolving 
many regional issues.  Despite all that support, Turkey's preference 
in the US has been the Republicans.  With Obama's presidency, there 
will be different issues in Turkey-US relations.  But these will not 
remained unresolved issues like a sword of Damocles forever hanging 
over Turkey.  As has happened in the past, with a Democrat 
president, every problem will be resolved." 
 
Sami Kohen wrote in mainstream Milliyet:  "The global positive 
attitude to Obama's victory is a great opportunity not only for 
himself but for the US as well.  If Obama fulfills all his promises, 
 
ANKARA 00001932  002 OF 003 
 
 
then the US will have a chance to improve its damaged image.  There 
is one drawback: that people's expectations for Obama will be too 
high.  How much of the current foreign policies could be changed by 
Obama?  There is no doubt that Obama's stance and approach to 
foreign issues will be different, but will he be able to pursue 
completely different policies towards big individual problems like 
Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Russia?  It is only natural for him 
to keep in mind the US' basic strategic and economic interests while 
shaping his foreign policies.  Nevertheless, the world considers 
Obama as an opportunity for a peaceful world." 
 
Turkey Will Host Caucasus Trilateral 
Media outlets carry excerpts from visiting Azeri President Aliyev's 
address at the Turkish Parliament where he praised Turkey's 
mediation efforts in the region, including President Gul's recent 
rapprochement with Armenia.  Aliyev also emphasized the Nagorno 
Karabakh issue by calling it "the most important challenge to 
stability in the region," yet expressed some hope that Turkey's 
regional efforts may be a positive contribution.  "Our hopes have 
increased because of Turkey's recent efforts in the region.  We will 
watch new political steps" Aliyev said. 
 
Zaman front page feature reads: "Gul Will Bring Armenian and Azeri 
President Together in Istanbul."  In connection with the Aliyev 
reports, Islamist oriented Zaman and mass appeal Aksam add that 
Turkey is preparing to host a trilateral summit between Azerbaijan 
and Armenia.  Armenian President Sargsyan was asked to comment 
during his Brussels trip, and President Sargsyan said "I will be 
happy to meet with President Aliyev on any occasion."  The Zaman 
report also quoted Azeri Foreign Minister Mammadyarov as saying a 
Turkey-hosted trilateral summit would not focus only on the Nagorno 
Karabakh issue, but would also cover other issues of mutual concern. 
 According to Zaman, Ankara's initiative to host a trilateral is a 
deliberate step to prevent potential escalation of the Armenian 
genocide controversy in the US presidential election aftermath. 
 
Court Rejects Objections to Release Rape Suspect Islamist Journalist 
Uzmez 
Milliyet, Cumhuriyet, Posta, Radikal, Vatan and others:  Bursa 5th 
Heavy Penal Court rejected the objections to the release of Hussein 
Uzmez yesterday. Uzmez had been released from jail, pending trial 
for sexually abusing a 14 year old girl, after a medical report of 
the Council of Forensic Medicine claimed that the victim was not
