¶1.  SUMMARY. Taiwan's China Petroleum Corporation (CPC), 
announced September 27 a NT$0.9 per liter reduction in 
wholesale prices of gasoline and diesel fuel and implemented 
a system to base its wholesale prices on fluctuations in 
international crude oil markets.  This move follows years of 
direct control over fuel prices.  END SUMMARY 
 
MARKET VERSUS GOVERNMENT PRICING 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  With crude oil prices falling in international markets, 
State run CPC announced on Sept. 27 a NT$0.9 per liter 
reduction (NT$3.4/gallon or USD .10/gallon) in its wholesale 
price of gasoline and diesel.  At the same time CPC 
introduced a new pricing scheme, using the price fluctuations 
of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude as a benchmark. 
Henceforth, every Tuesday new prices will be announced based 
on the previous day's WTI cost per barrel.  Under the old 
pricing scheme, every time CPC wished to adjust oil prices, 
it had to obtain approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs 
(MOEA).  Now MOEA and CPC will jointly monitor and fine-tune 
the pricing scheme on a trial basis until the system is 
finalized next year.  On October 10, the first Tuesday since 
the plan was announced, CPC lowered the price of gasoline by 
a further NT$0.2 bringing the total drop in prices in two 
weeks to NT$1.10 or USD .035. 
 
CPC LOSING MONEY 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  Ironically, CPC can ill afford a price drop given the 
huge losses of NT$25.4 billion (about USD 769.7 million) it 
reported over the first eight months of this year.  According 
to the Taiwan Bureau of Energy, these losses are partly due 
to gasoline being sold below cost.  CPC has been selling at 
government-set prices and has aging refining equipment which 
results in higher production costs.  To placate consumers, 
MOEA Minister Chen Ruey-nong said on Sept. 25 that under the 
new floating gasoline price scheme, gasoline rates will be 
maintained at the lowest rate among Asian countries. 
 
CPC: MULTIPLE PRESSURES 
----------------------- 
 
¶4.  Industry insiders told AIT there is a lack of public 
understanding of the burden CPC has to bear, both from 
consumers and also from the legislature (Legislative Yuan or 
LY).  Analysts said mandated subsidies CPC must provide to 
Taipower and transportation companies have resulted in ever 
increasing deficits for CPC due to the increase in crude oil 
prices.  The latest market approach to pricing may reduce the 
deficit at CPC analysts believe but legislators were likely 
to continue to demand subsidized fuel prices for government 
agencies and consumers.  CPC has proposed to continue 
providing subsidized fuel to Taipower and transportation 
companies, but with quota limits.  Once those limits are 
reached the buyer must pay market prices. 
 
TAXI DRIVERS SEE A PROBLEM 
-------------------------- 
 
¶5.  The latest gasoline price change drew protests from taxi 
drivers in Taipei on September 30 when dozens of taxis queued 
in front of CPC headquarters to protest what they saw as 
price reductions not commensurate with the drop in 
international oil prices.  CPC admits that the company needs 
to educate the public on the realities of fuel prices. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6.  Until the rapid increase in the price of crude oil 
beginning this year, CPC and Taipower were able to stay 
profitable, enabling the authorities to mandate low energy 
prices in Taiwan.  By doing so, the government has lulled 
consumers into expecting low fuel prices indefinitely.  Going 
to a market-based pricing scheme will be politically painless 
as long as international prices are falling.  But, as prices 
move up, as well as down, LY members and other elected 
leaders will find it increasingly challenging to stay out of 
CPC pricing decisions.  With mayoral elections for Taipei and 
Kaohsiung (Taiwan's two most populous cities) set for 
December this year, it is no surprise CPC's pricing trial is 
set to run through the end of the year and be reviewed and 
finalized next year.  END COMMENT
