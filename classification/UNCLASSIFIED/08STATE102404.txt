REF: HARARE 863 
 
Kudos to Embassy Harare for its comprehensive assessment of 
the current negative environmental impacts on wildlife and 
forestry in Zimbabwe due to the ongoing political and 
economic strife in the country (Harare 863).  Natural 
resource conservation is an OES top priority in Africa.  The 
cable clearly and succinctly highlights the close 
relationship between poor governance and weak democratic 
institutions with environmental degradation and impunity for 
the offenders.  The dire economic situation of the Zimbabwean 
people in turn, contributes to increased deforestation, 
poaching,  hunting and trafficking in endangered species. 
Great job again in highlighting the direct link between good 
governance and natural resource conservation.
