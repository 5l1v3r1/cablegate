EXECUTIVE COUNCIL CHAIR 
 
REF: SECSTATE 11293 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On January 31, Poloff delivered reftel instructions 
to Kim Jae-woo, Disarmament and Nonproliferation Division of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT).  Kim 
stated that the ROK Ambassador at the Hague did not discuss 
the possibility of South Korea running for the Executive 
Council Chair of the Organization for the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons (OPCW).  Kim explained that while Seoul 
would make the ultimate decision, any such bid would usually 
be initiated  by the ROK Ambassador at the Hague.  To date, 
the ROK Ambassador has not expressed any interest in the 
candidacy. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Kim also shared that his office was unaware of 
Iran's desire to serve as the Executive Council Chair.  Kim 
described the OPCW as a "well-oiled machine which does not 
require much attention."  Kim stated that he appreciated the 
information shared and said he would distribute it to 
relevant ROKG offices, including his colleagues at the Hague.
