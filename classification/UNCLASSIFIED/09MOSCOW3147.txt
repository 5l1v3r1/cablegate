SUBJECT:  EXBS: RUSSIA ADVISOR MONTHLY REPORTING CABLE - DECEMBER 
2009 
 
¶1.  Begin summary: BROAD ITEMS OF INTEREST TO ADVISORS AND AGENCY 
MANAGERS: Planning with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proceeds on 
the reinstituted Program Review and Export Licensing Exchange 
scheduled for February 2010.  EXBS has submitted data on training 
conducted through the program for the past 5 years at the request of 
UGA/CITS, which is doing an assessment of the Russian export 
controls system.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  Completed Actions for Reporting Period. 
 
¶A.  Site Assessments and Meetings During the Reporting Period. 
 
i.  December 8 - EXBS Advisor and Assistant met with representatives 
of the export controls section within the Security and Disarmament 
Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry.  The meeting was 
organized to present to EXBS feedback from MFA and other agencies 
regarding the agenda for the Program Review and the Program Plan for 
FY08, FY09, and FY10.  During this meeting, MFA took the opportunity 
to raise concerns about issues related to implementation of UNSCR 
1540 and arms control compliance - items outside the focus of the 
meeting agenda.  These concerns are the topic of a separate cable, 
MRN 003018, dated December 16. 
 
ii.  December 9 - EXBS Advisor participated in a roundtable 
discussion at the embassy led by Ambassador Bonnie Jenkins, 
Coordinator for Threat Reduction Programs, which also included DTRA, 
DOE, and EST, plus the U.S. Civilian Research and Development 
Foundation (CRDF)and the Center for Policy Studies (PIR Center), 
regarding the future of the International Science and Technology 
Center (ISTC).  One PIR Center representative commented that Russia 
finds itself in a complex position in nonproliferation efforts: 
some forces within the government are trying to get to nuclear zero, 
while other forces support continued nuclear testing. 
 
iii.  December 10 - EXBS Advisor attended the 15th anniversary 
conference of ISTC in Moscow.  The breakout session on "ISTC Impacts 
- Nuclear" had the most relevance for EXBS, in that it presented 
ISTC's cooperation with US and European scientists to jointly 
develop peaceful uses for nuclear energy. 
 
iv.  December 10 - EXBS Advisor attended the Customs Attache Club 
event at the Chinese Embassy.  The program included speeches by the 
Chinese ambassador and other prominent embassy staff recalling the 
60th anniversary of the People's Republic; the achievements of China 
Customs; and China's longstanding cooperation with the Soviet Union 
and Russia.  There was also a Chinese tea-drinking ceremony and 
performances by Chinese opera and pop singers and, of course, 
Chinese food. 
 
v.  December 10 - EXBS Advisor attended the 10th anniversary 
celebration of the Open World program at Spaso House, the 
Ambassador's residence.  The Advisor had several productive 
conversations with embassy staff from the political, economic, and 
scientific sections, which have resulted in greater information 
sharing. 
 
vi.  EXBS Advisor met with the DCM to deliver a year-end report of 
EXBS activities and a look ahead to 2010.  DCM agreed with Advisor's 
suggestion that occasional updates can be very useful and will be 
scheduled during the coming year. 
 
vii.  December 30 - EXBS Advisor and FBI Legal Attache Bryan Earl 
met with University of Georgia Center for International Trade and 
Security (UGA/CITS) Washington representative Julia Khersonsky. 
Discussion was very general, touching on topics of mutual interest 
in the areas of export controls and nonproliferation and ways to 
improve cooperation with Russian government officials. 
 
¶B.  Training Conducted During Reporting Period. 
 
i.  US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement (ICE) accompanied 8 Russian Customs officers on 
an International Visitor Program (IVP) to US ports of entry December 
12-20 in Southern California and Washington, DC.  Feedback from 
various sources, both US and Russian, indicated that the delegation 
was very impressed by the technological and procedural efficiency of 
U.S. Customs operations, especially at the Long Beach port.  The 
 
group left the U.S. to return to Russia one day later than planned, 
due to massive snowfall on the East Coast. 
 
¶C.  Equipment Delivered During Reporting Period. 
 
i.  The EXBS Russia program does not distribute equipment. 
 
¶3. Imminent Training or Equipment Status Update 
 
i.  In January, EXBS will reconnect with CBP, which is working with 
the Russian Embassy in Washington, on an IVP for Rosgranitsa, the 
new federal agency charged with security of border facilities. 
Rosgranitsa had approached CBP last fall for assistance in visiting 
US ports of entry.  The visit was postponed to at least March 2010 
due to the holidays and the extended medical leave of the CBP 
Program Manager.  EXBS has been working with CBP on this trip and 
may also develop program activities with Rosgranitsa and CBP. 
 
¶4.  Significant Developments in Export Controls, Nonproliferation, 
or Related Border Security 
 
i.  On January 1, the customs union with Russia, Kazakhstan and 
Belarus will go into effect.  The three countries will use the same 
foreign trade tariffs and rules with one another, though it will 
likely take another six months for all tariffs to be synchronized. 
 
¶5.  Country Plans and Other Assistance 
 
i.  EXBS sent a cable MRN 003030 dated December 17 regarding Post 
concurrence with the FY08, FY09, and FY10 Program Plan.  The Russian 
MFA will provide its comments on the abstract of the programs, 
submitted on December 7, when the Advisor meets with MFA at their 
request on January 12.  As the lead agency, MFA has previously given 
broad approval to our program ideas.  In addition to receiving final 
stakeholder approval for the Program Plan, the purpose of this 
meeting will be to continue to move forward arrangements for the 
reinstituted Program Review and additional Export Licensing Exchange 
planned for February in Washington.
