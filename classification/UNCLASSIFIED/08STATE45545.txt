SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN PRE-LICENSE END USE CHECK ON 
APPLICATION 05-050100199 AND 05-050100378 
 
¶1.  This is an action message.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2.  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post assistance in conducting a 
pre-license check for the export of riot control equipment to 
Israel.  Post is requested to complete this Blue Lantern 
check within 30 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern 
check will affect pending and future licenses involving 
parties to this license. 
 
¶3.  Reason for request: inconsistencies were noted in the 
license application supporting documents.  Both licenses list 
the Israel Police as the Foreign End User.  The DSP-83 
Non-Transfer and Use Certificates, however, list different 
Foreign End Users: the Israel Police and the Israel Prison 
Service. 
 
¶4.  ACTION: Please contact the Foreign End User, the Israel 
Police, and verify its request for the exact quantities and 
specific types of commodity listed on each license below.  If 
possible, please speak directly with the person who signed 
the DSP-83 included with license 05-050100378, Ran Sabati of 
the Israel Police Purchasing Department.  Please also contact 
the Israel Prison Service and speak with the person who 
signed the DSP-83 included with license 05-050100199, Chief 
Weapons Officer Eitan Ben-Avi.  Ask Mr. Ben-Avi if he 
remembers signing this document for the riot control 
equipment listed on the license, even though the equipment is 
actually destined for the Israel Police.  END ACTION.
