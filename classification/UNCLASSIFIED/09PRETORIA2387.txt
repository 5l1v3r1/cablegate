SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA: Request Funding Re-obligation 
 
¶1.  Summary:  This is a request for approval for the use of funding, 
previously obligated for the immigration and Border Patrol, under 
obligation code: 1911461022-0584-0584402002-2721-2156-142204.  The 
re-obligated funds will be used for narcotics detection by the U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection Service (CBP).  CBP is requesting INL 
assistance to purchase Narcotic Test Kits for the SARS.   End 
Summary 
¶2.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) assists the South 
African Revenue Service (SARS) in Capacity Building under the World 
Customs Organizations (WCO) Framework of Standards.  CBP was 
instrumental in the training and development of the SARS Customs 
Border Control Unit.  This team is modeled after the CBP 
Antiterrorism Contraband Enforcement Team, (ATCET), and has had 
considerable success since its inception in 2007 
¶3.  In the Port of Durban the CBP Container Security Initiative 
works with SARS to identify suspect shipments containing terrorist 
instruments, weapons of mass destruction, narcotics and other 
contraband destined for the United States. There are two CBP 
Officers and a TDY ICE Special Agent located in the port. 
¶4.  The kits will help SARS to identify organizations involved in 
Transnational Crimes.  The kits will provide a presumptive drug test 
for suspicious substances attempting to enter or transit through 
South Africa.  CBP will assist SARS in developing protocols for 
security and storage of the kits, and a protocol for activating the 
use of the drug test kits.  Examples: canine alert, supervisory 
approval, documentation of findings.  Train-the-Trainer for 
sustainability of proficiency. 
 
 
¶5.  Below is the name of the U.S. supplier, the requested items and 
the cost. This is an estimated cost because the list does not 
include sales tax and shipping costs. The CBP representatives have 
selected a single source supplier because they have an existing 
business relationship with this company and they are satisfied with 
the performance of the product.
