REF: MOSCOW 1939 
 
¶1. (U) During a familiarization visit to Moscow on July 
29-31, A/USTR for Europe and the Middle East Christopher 
Wilson met with his counterpart on the U.S.- Russia IPR 
Working Group Deputy Economic Development Minister Stanislav 
Voskresenskiy.  Voskresenskiy confirmed his commitment to the 
WG, established as part of the U.S.-Russia bilateral 
agreement on intellectual property rights.  Voskresenskiy 
agreed to having the next plenary meeting in Washington, DC 
during the September-October 2009 time frame.  The meeting 
will review commitments made during the March plenary in 
Moscow and establish next steps in the lead up to Russia's 
accession to the WTO. 
 
¶2. (U) On the sidelines of the last IPWG plenary in March, 
Russia requested meetings with U.S. law enforcement agencies 
enforcing IPR.  The Russians would like to observe operations 
and investigations in the U.S. in order to gain practical 
experience and technical knowledge needed to improve their 
operations in Russia.  Chris Wilson agreed to look into 
setting up such meetings as part of the next plenary in 
Washington.  The Russians would also like to meet with U.S. 
royalty collecting agencies to learn about the U.S. contract 
based royalties structure.
