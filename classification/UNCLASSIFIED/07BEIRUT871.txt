REF: STATE 83530 
 
¶1.  Embassy Beirut has no objections to the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) proposed award of research project 
AG01284613 entitled, "Michigan Center on the Demography of 
Aging," to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and the 
American University of Beirut.  Embassy Beirut sees no 
adverse U.S. foreign policy concerns.  This is based on the 
understanding that the activity as proposed will be conducted 
by culturally sensitive academic actors on the University's 
research staff. 
 
¶2.  Embassy notes that this is a pilot study that ultimately 
may lead to additional research in Lebanon.  The NIH should 
be aware that this or any follow-on research design needs to 
take into consideration the special security restrictions 
related to living and working in Lebanon.  Any design that 
involves official US government employees visiting or 
residing in Lebanon requires close coordination with the 
Embassy to assure that the timing and availability of housing 
and security-related support costs can be addressed and 
supported.  Embassy Beirut is a high-threat post, and all USG 
staff working in Lebanon live on a fortified compound and 
cannot leave the compound without armed guards.  All USG 
employees traveling to Lebanon on official business are 
required must obtain Post country clearance prior to their 
arrival.  Finally, Post reminds NIH that the Department of 
State recently issued another travel warning advising 
Americans to defer all non-essential travel to Lebanon, which 
is available on the State Department's website www.state.gov
