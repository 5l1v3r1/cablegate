REF: STATE 69216 
 
(U) On April 15, we delivered reftel demarche encouraging 
French participation in the April 28-29 terrorism finance 
workshops to Karine Seguar, Chief of the Finance Ministry's 
Bureau of Asset Controls; to the French Financial 
Intelligence Unit TRACFIN; and to the MFA.  Responding first, 
Segura explained that advance notice of the meeting was 
received somewhat late (our demarche in fact was the first 
notice she had received), but she hoped a summary would be 
made available after the workshop.  Following this 
conversation, we spoke on April 25 with Yves Trotignon from 
the C/T office at the MFA, who said that "2 or 3" French 
officials from the Finance Ministry would in fact attend. 
Nobody from the MFA would attend, said Trotignon, although 
the possibility remained that someone from the French Embassy 
in Luxembourg might join the Finance Ministry officials.
