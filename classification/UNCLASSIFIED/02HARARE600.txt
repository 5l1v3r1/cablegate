¶1.   UNDER HEADLINE "PLACING OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF 
   VOTERS," THE INDEPENDENT "DAILY NEWS" DEDICATED ITS 
   MARCH 7 EDITORIAL CRITICIZING APPARENT EFFORTS BY THE 
   GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE TO MAKE VOTING IN URBAN AREAS 
   MORE DIFFICULT. EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
"THE FAILURE BY BOTH THE REGISTRAR GENERAL'S OFFICE 
AND THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION (ESC) TO 
ADVISE VOTERS PROPERLY ON THEIR RESPECTIVE WARDS AND 
POLLING STATIONS IS ONE OF MANY ATTEMPTS TO CONFUSE 
THE ELECTORATE AND PREDETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THIS 
WEEKEND'S MAYORAL, MUNICIPAL AND PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTIONS.  WITH JUST TWO DAYS TO GO BEFORE VOTING 
STARTS, THERE HAS BEEN NO OFFICIAL NOTIFICATION OF 
WHAT VOTERS SHOULD DO IN ORDER TO AVOID UNNECESSARY 
FRUSTRATION.  IN THE CASE OF MAYORAL AND MUNICIPAL 
ELECTIONS IN CHITUNGWIZA AND HARARE, THE FAILURE MUST 
BE SEEN AS PART OF AN OVERALL STRATEGY TO CONFUSE THE 
ELECTORATE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE RULING PARTY, ZANU 
PF'S GRIP IN THE TWO MAJOR URBAN CENTERS DOES NOT 
SUFFER AN INGLORIOUS DEMISE. 
 
".FORCED DISENFRANCHISEMENT IS ANOTHER WEAPON IN THE 
ARSENAL OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE RULING PARTY.  IN 
THE URBAN AREAS THE LIKELIHOOD OF MORE PEOPLE BEING 
TURNED AWAY IS GOING TO BE HIGHER THAN ELSEWHERE IN 
THE COUNTRY.  THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE GOVERNMENT 
DOES NOT TRUST THE SUPPORT OF THE URBAN VOTERS AND 
THEY WILL BE DOING THEIR DAMNEDEST TO ENSURE CITY 
DWELLERS DO NOT HAVE A FAIR CHANCE OF VOTING. . .  THE 
DEMAND FOR PROOF OF RESIDENCY IS YET ANOTHER OBSTACLE. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

. .  THAT IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH GOVERNMENT HAS GONE 
IN ORDER TO SUBVERT THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO FREELY 
ELECT WHO SHOULD LEAD THIS COUNTRY."
