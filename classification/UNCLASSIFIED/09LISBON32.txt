REF: 08 STATE 134385 
 
¶1.  (U) Portugal plans to sign on as a founding member of the 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) at its launch 
in Bonn on January 26 and 27.  Portugal's delegation will 
include Jose Manuel Perdigoto, head of the Directorate of 
Energy and Geology (DGEG), DGEG deputy Bento Morais Sarmento, 
and Christina Muniz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
¶2.  (U) Muniz said renewable energy is key to Portugal's 
economic development plans and Economy Minister Pinho, who 
leads GOP energy policy, was convinced Portugal must 
participate, despite IRENA's overlap with the International 
Energy Agency.  Portugal would have preferred there be more 
definition of member cooperation in the new agency, but with 
the founding meeting scheduled in January the GOP determined 
it is critical to participate in the important discussions at 
the organization's launch.
