SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: US CROSS-STRAIT POLICY 
 
 
Summary:  News coverage of Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies 
November 6 still focused on consumer price hikes. They also reported 
on the US Department of Defense (DoD) corrections to a news report 
on its Web site that originally said that the US is against Taiwan 
independence and for peaceful reunification of China and Taiwan. 
Both DoD and the Department of State said the US cross-Strait policy 
remains unchanged.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, an 
editorial in the mass-circulation "Apple Daily" said that, if the 
DoD news report is true, the US may be trying to rid itself of the 
obligation of protecting Taiwan.  End summary. 
 
 
A) "The US Secretly Scheming to Get Rid of Taiwan Relations Act" 
 
The mass-circulation "Apple Daily" [circulation: 530,000] 
editorialed (11/06): 
 
"During his visit to China US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said 
[President] George W. Bush opposes Taiwan independence and defines 
the referendum on Taiwan's UN bid as a 'referendum on independence.' 
 The worst is that President Bush actually said he would be happy to 
see the two sides across the Strait reunify peacefully. 
 
"The DPP believes the US does not want Taiwan to be unified with 
China, lest it lose an important chess piece with which to hold 
China in check.  Therefore, the US could only privately support the 
DPP's continued rule.  This is a matter of principle.  Even if the 
US does not care if Taiwan unifies with China, as long as Taiwan 
does not want reunification and if China uses force, the US cannot 
but get involved.  This US dilemma toward Taiwan is the reason why 
Ah-bian dares to offend the US.  In other words, Ah-bian, who is 
good at kidnapping other people, has also kidnapped the US. 
However, Bian and the DPP are too naive. 
 
"Bush's saying that he is happy to see peaceful reunification is 
very grave.  It is much worse than the change of wording from 'not 
support' to 'oppose' Taiwan independence.  Bush seems to have moved 
from being anti-Bian but not anti-Taiwan to being anti-Taiwan.  We 
hope this story is not true.  If it is, Taiwan will be in serious 
danger.  Maybe the US and China would reach some consensus, such as 
'joint management of the Taiwan Strait,' or 'an implicit agreement 
to a military invasion of Taiwan,' etc.  The fact that the 'UN bid 
referendum' has been defined by the US as an 'independence 
referendum' may as well be an action for the US to prepare for 
ridding itself of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). 
 
"The US has been constrained by the TRA for years and faced with 
much quibbling and protest from China.  This has deeply affected the 
broader US global strategy.  In addition to being kidnapped by 
Taiwan, the US side has already made many complaints [to Taiwan]. 
The US is only waiting for Taiwan to make violations so that it can 
take the opportunity to get rid of Taiwan and the restraint of the 
TRA.  It can justifiably tell Congress, the media, and the public 
that Taiwan, not the [U.S.] Executive Branch, is to blame.  Taiwan's 
violation is to 'declare independence' or make provocative moves. 
 
"The US has deployed a trap in order to free itself by publicly 
stating that the TRA protects a Taiwan of the status quo rather than 
a Taiwan that declares independence, provokes China and brings war. 
On the one hand, this is to warn the DPP authorities not to seek 
trouble.  On the other hand, this can be seen as a statement that 
Taiwan's trespassing the red line is the premise for the US to shake 
off its obligation to protect Taiwan.  It is because Taiwan has 
secretly substituted the object in the TRA.  This Taiwan is no long 
 
SIPDIS 
the original Taiwan as when the TRA was enacted.  Then the US is 
surely not obligated to protect an object that has become not 
related to the TRA. 
 
"This is the reason and schema in which the US defines the UN 
referendum as an independence referendum.  Following this US logic: 
the UN referendum is equals a referendum on independence, equals a 
Taiwan different from the one mentioned in the TRA, equals no 
obligation for the US to protect Taiwan, equals a cross-Strait war 
in which the US will not be involved, equals US-China relations 
unaffected.  Taiwan's security depends on entangling the US.  How 
can we let the US get away and China take advantage?  It is too 
dangerous.  Do the Bian authorities realize this trap?"
