SUBJECT: ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER, WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS, BLASTS 
RWANDA AT MEETING WITH P-3 +2 AND MONUC 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Acting Foreign Minister Alain Lubamba convened a 
snap meeting of P-3 + 2 ambassadors and MONUC on October 25. 
Lubamba, a member of the micro-party "UDEMO" (Union of Democratic 
 
Mobutistes) delivered a rambling statement condemning Tutsi 
politician Azarias Ruberwa, criticized renegade Tutsi general and 
insurgency leader Laurent Nkunda, and asked for increased foreign 
assistance to deal with gender-based violence in the east of the 
DRC.  At the end of the meeting he distributed a highly-inflammatory 
statement (paras 8 and 9 below) criticizing Rwanda.  The statement 
did not receive significant press coverage in the DRC. Lubamba was 
clearly acting without instructions, as he has done in the past. 
End summary. 
¶2.  (U) Late October 24 Acting Foreign Minister Alain Lubamba called 
Charge to say he was convening a meeting of the P-3 + 2 ambassadors 
and MONUC for the following day at noon.  (Note:  Lubamba was acting 
in the absence of Foreign Minister Antipas Mbusa, who had departed 
for the U.S. with President Joseph Kabila in connection with 
Kabila's October 26 visit with President Bush. End note.)  Charge 
asked why he was being convened; Lubamba replied he would explain at 
the meeting, which was attended by the ambassadors of France, the 
United Kingdom and Belgium, plus the charges of the United States 
and South Africa.  MONUC was represented by a political counselor. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Lubamba introduced the chief of staff of the minister of 
humanitarian affairs, representing his boss who, Lubamba said, was 
in the hospital, as well as a medical expert on gender based 
violence.  After the introductions, he began the meeting with a 
rambling monologue referring to recent statements in the U.S. by 
Azarias Ruberwa Manywa, a prominent Tutsi politician who served as 
vice president in the transitional government.  Ruberwa, Lubamba 
stated, had shown he was disloyal to his country by criticizing 
President Kabila publicly while in the U.S.  Lubamba then criticized 
Nkunda, repeating the much-used argument that Congolese Tutsis were 
not persecuted; in fact, Lubamba emphasized, some of the DRC's most 
prominent and powerful people are Tutsis.  He then spoke on the 
subject of gender based violence and its effect on victims and their 
children, asking for increased foreign assistance to deal with the 
problem.  The medical expert added to Lubamba's statement with 
comments on physical and psychological aspects of the issue. 
¶4.  (SBU) Attendees were invited to make comments.  The French and 
Belgian ambassadors thanked the acting minister for his invitation 
and reassured him their governments were outraged over the 
atrocities in the east and were working with the GDRC to end the 
conflict.  U.S. Charge stated the U.S. was actively engaged in 
efforts to end the violence and that President Kabila's meeting with 
President Bush the following day was testimony to the importance the 
U.S. attaches to ending the conflict and human rights abuses.  He 
then said that in democracies like the United States public opinion 
was an important component in the formulation of foreign policy. 
Efforts to obtain greater funding for victims of gender based 
violence in the east might be compromised if, as some human rights 
organizations were saying, many gender based crimes were committed 
by the DRC's own military forces.  He referred to Amnesty 
International's latest report, released the previous day, which 
maintains that most gender based crimes in the DRC are carried out 
by the army.  The U.K. ambassador picked up on this, also 
emphasizing the importance of taking measures to reduce perpetration 
of these crimes by the FARDC. 
¶5.  (SBU) The meeting ended at 1:50 pm.  The acting minister then 
called in the press, approximately 30 persons in all, which had been 
waiting outside the room, and asked attendees to remain with him as 
he spoke to the media.  He then handed out a statement (paras 8 and 
9).  All diplomats excused themselves politely and left the room 
stealthily before Lubamba's press conference began.  The event and 
the statement were not given significant coverage in Kinshasa's 
media. 
¶6.  (SBU) Note: Alain Lubamba is a member of UDEMO ("Union des 
Democrates Mobutistes"), a micro-party with one senator (the senate 
has 108 members) and 9 deputies (that chamber has 500).  The party 
is headed by Minister of State for Agriculture, Francois-Joseph 
Nzanga Mobutu, a son of the former dictator.  Younger brother 
Albert-Philippe Mobutu Giala Kassa is a deputy.  Although the party 
is small, some observers affirm its presence in the Kabila 
government is a powerful symbol of reconciliation between supporters 
of the late dictator and those who fought to oust him under Laurent 
Kabila, father of the current president.  End note. 
¶7.  (SBU) Comment:  Lubamba similarly convened the diplomatic corps 
on September 15 during the absence of President Kabila and Foreign 
Minister Mbusa to attend the UN General Assembly.  At that meeting 
he condemned the UN Security Council press statement of September 12 
which called on "all parties to comply with international law." 
Lubamba claimed that the UN statement gave Nkunda equal status with 
the GDRC.  He also handed out a statement he drafted criticizing the 
UN, which was covered in the local media.  It was later confirmed 
that Lubamba's action on September 15 was not authorized by the 
presidency or the foreign minister.  UN Special Representative and 
MONUC chief William Swing (pls protect) told charge October 24 he

would not attend Lubamba's meeting that day because of the Acting 
Minister's inaccurate statement of September 15.  Charge has 
discussed Lubamba's unauthorized grand-standing with other 
diplomats, who have agreed to complain to Foreign Minister Mbusa. 
End comment.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO 
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
 
STATEMENT FROM THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL 
COOPERATION TO THE HEADS OF P3+2 DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS ACCREDITED TO 
THE DRC, ON THE SECURITY SITUATION IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE 
REPUBLIC 
 
SINCE THE ORGANIZATION OF DEMOCRATIC, FREE AND TRANSPARENT ELECTIONS 
IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO, THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET FOR 
ITSELF AS ITS ULTIMATE GOAL THE RESTORATION OF THE STATE AS THE 
ENGINE OF NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION AFTER LONG YEARS OF POLITICAL 
TURBULENCE. 
 
WHILE ALL EFFORTS MUST BE FOCUSED ON, AND MOBILIZED AROUND, THIS 
LOFTY GOAL, INSECURITY IN THE EAST OF THE DRC, LIKE A THORN IN THE 
FOOT, INTERFERES AND THEREFORE REQUIRES THE CONGOLESE GOVERNMENT TO 
RESTORE STATE AUTHORITY. THIS RESTORATION MUST INVOLVE ENSURING THE 
SAFETY OF CIVILIAN POPULATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN SEVERELY HARMED. 
 
WITH THIS IN MIND, THE PRESIDENT RECENTLY VISITED NORTH KIVU TO SEE 
FOR HIMSELF HOW THE SITUATION IS EVOLVING.  ASSUMING HIS 
RESPONSIBILITIES AS GUARANTOR OF NATIONAL UNITY AND TERRITORIAL 
INTEGRITY, HE REAFFIRMED HIS DETERMINATION TO PACIFY THE EAST OF THE 
REPUBLIC BY ALL NECESSARY MEANS, BY PROTECTING THEREFORE ALL 
COMMUNITIES WITHOUT ANY DISCRIMINATION WHATSOEVER. 
 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECALL THAT DEPOSED GENERAL NKUNDA BEGAN HIS 
REBELLION WHEN HE WORKED AS A REGIONAL MILITARY COMMANDER AND WHEN 
HIS COMMUNITY WAS REPRESENTED AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE 
GOVERNMENT, WITH ONE OF THEIR OWN HAVING ASSUMED THE OFFICE OF VICE

End summary. 
¶2.  (U) Late October 24 Acting Foreign Minister Alain Lubamba called 
Charge to say he was convening a meeting of the P-3 + 2 ambassadors 
and MONUC for the following day at noon.  (Note:  Lubamba was acting 
in the absence of Foreign Minister Antipas Mbusa, who had departed 
for the U.S. with President Joseph Kabila in connection with 
Kabila's October 26 visit with President Bush. End note.)  Charge 
asked why he was being convened; Lubamba replied he would explain at 
the meeting, which was attended by the ambassadors of France, the 
United Kingdom and Belgium, plus the charges of the United States 
and South Africa.  MONUC was represented by a political counselor. 
 
PRESIDENT IN CHARGE OF THE POLITICAL, DEFENSE AND SECURITY 
COMMISSION; THIS DID NOT EVEN WEAKEN THE CHANCES OF A CANDIDATE FROM 
HIS COMMUNITY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, WHO FINISHED SIXTH IN A 
LIST OF 33 CANDIDATES. 
 
THIS DISPROVES THE ARGUMENTS OF THE ETHNIC MINORITY THAT WOULD 
JUSTIFY MR. NKUNDA'S MUTINY AND THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE CARRIED OUT BY 
HIM. 
 
IN ADDITION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE LARGEST NUMBER OF 
VOTES FOR THE TUTSI CANDIDATE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WAS IN 
THE ORIENTALE AND KATANGA PROVINCES, WHILE IN THE MINEMBWE 
STRONGHOLD, HE RECEIVED THE SMALLEST NUMBER OF VOTES. 
 
ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN INVOKING THE HARDSHIPS OF THE TUTSI 
MINORITY, IT IS WORTH POINTING OUT THAT MR. NKUNDA IS CURRENTLY 
DEPLOYED IN THE RUTSHURU TERRITORY, WHERE THERE IS A HIGH 
CONCENTRATION OF CONGOLESE HUTUS, AND THAT THERE IS REASON FOR 
CONCERN BECAUSE OF THE ABUSES TO WHICH THESE POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN 
SUBJECTED ON A DAILY BASIS BY THE INSURGENTS.  IT IS FEARED THAT 
GENOCIDE IS BEING CARRIED OUT THERE, IN LIGHT OF RECENTLY DISCOVERED 
COMMON GRAVES. 
 
FURTHERMORE, SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE TUTSI COMMUNITY HOLD IMPORTANT 
POSITIONS IN SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY. THIS IS THE CASE 
WITH MOISE NYARUGABO, ELECTED TO THE SENATE FROM KINSHASA, ALTHOUGH 
HIS TRIBE HAS NO MEMBERS IN THE LOWER CHAMBER.  THE CONGOLESE 
PREFERRED TO CAST A USEFUL VOTE. 
 
MOREOVER, WITH MORE THAN 450 TRIBES IN THE DRC, ONLY 147 ARE 
REPRESENTED IN THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  ALL TOLD, 203 TRIBES ARE 
ABSENT, THUS UNREPRESENTED.  IT SHOULD BE ALSO NOTED THAT THE NUMBER 
OF GENERALS AND SENIOR OFFICERS FROM THE TUTSI COMMUNITY IN THE 
NATIONAL ARMY EXCEEDS THAT FROM ALL THE TRIBES OF NORTH AND SOUTH 
KIVU COMBINED. 
 
THE SUPPORT GIVEN TO THE DEPOSED GENERAL POORLY HIDES A STRATEGY 
USED BY RWANDA'S POWER STRUCTURE TO JUSTIFY REPEATED AGGRESSIONS 
AGAINST THE DRC. 
 
INDEED, SINCE 1994 RWANDA HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CREATE A DEMOCRATIC 
STATE. THE TUTSI TRIBE HOLDS THE REINS OF POWER WITHOUT SHARING 
THEM, USING THE FALLACIOUS ARGUMENT THAT IT IS PURSUING THOSE WHO 
COMMITTED GENOCIDE, BUT HUTUS SHOULD NOT ALL BE MIXED UP WITH THE 
MURDEROUS FOLLY OF 1994 SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY EXPRESS THEIR POLITICAL 
AMBITIONS. 
 
IT IS THIS INABILITY TO ESTABLISH THE RULE OF LAW FROM WHICH FLOWS 
THIS ARGUMENT OF PROTECTING THE TUTSI MINORITY.  THIS IS WHY THE DRC 
IS ASKING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ASSUME ITS FULL 
RESPONSIBILITY TO STRONGLY PRESSURE THE MONOLITHIC POWER STRUCTURE 
IN KIGALI SO IT WILL OPEN UP THE DEMOCRATIC GAME AND ALLOW ALL 
RWANDANS TO RETURN HOME, AND TO FIND, THROUGH DIALOGUE, SOLUTIONS TO 
THE PROBLEM OF MANAGING POLITICAL POWER, A PROBLEM WHICH ACUTELY 
EXISTS THERE. 
 
DOING OTHERWISE WOULD JEOPARDIZE FOR A LONG TIME A CHANCE TO ACHIEVE 
LASTING PEACE IN THE REGION. BECAUSE THE HUTU MAJORITY, WHICH HAS 
BEEN EXCLUDED FROM STATE POWER, WILL HAVE NO RECOURSE BUT TO USE 
FORCE, WHICH WOULD CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS REVERSE.
