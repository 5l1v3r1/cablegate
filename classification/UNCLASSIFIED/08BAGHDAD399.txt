SUBJECT: US MISSION IN IRAQ IS SEEKING FDA EXPERT; HEALTH 
CARE ADMINISTRATION CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: The US Mission in Iraq is currently seeking a 
food and drug safety expert and CFO health care administrator 
to fill two established ministerial capacity positions. These 
positions will serve as senior advisors to the Iraqi Ministry 
of Health (MoH) on strategic planning and implementation of 
food and drug safety guidelines and budget forecasting and 
execution. The personnel are needed immediately for a one 
year tour of duty. END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Need for Food and Drug Safety Expertise and 
CFO Health Care Administration 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. In light of recent security gains, engagement and capacity 
building opportunities with the Government of Iraq (GoI) have 
improved. This has provided new opportunities, particularly 
with ministries where our engagements have been limited.  The 
Ministry of Health is a prime example.  For that reason, 
Embassy Baghdad's current personnel complement of the Health 
Attache's office that includes a Health Attache, Deputy 
Health Attache, Senior Program Officer and two Medical 
Advisors shared with Multi National Forces-Iraq (MNF-I)needs 
to be enhanced. 
 
¶3. The Health Attache's Office continues to focus on areas 
where Iraqi capacity is lacking.  The most important current 
needs are for a food and drug safety expert and chief 
financial officer. 
 
¶4. The FDA expert's key focus will be the importation of 
foods and medicines, establishing protocols for inspections, 
testing and distribution. He/she will also serve as a senior 
advisor to the MoH and work to de-conflict current laws in 
Kimadia, Iraq's existing drug procurement system.  As the 
surge continues, it is critical that a food and drug safety 
expert come to Iraq to build the MoH's capacity and assist 
the Iraqis with food and drug safety and medicine procurement 
and distribution. 
 
¶5. The Medical Financial Advisor will also report directly to 
the Health Attache.  He/she will work directly with the 
Ministry of Health in developing and implementing budget 
forecasting and execution, strategic planning for long term 
financial needs of MoH and improving MoH's ability to 
obligate and spend its capital budget.  This is a key element 
necessary to provide for a greater self sufficiency for GOI. 
 
 
¶6. The Deputy Health Attache is expected to arrive in March. 
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is identifying a public 
health expert to coordinate health endeavors between the 
embassy, Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and embedded 
PRTS (ePRTs).  This will be a 6 month TDY.  Two civilian 
experts are being recruited for the healthcare administration 
and finance and emergency capacity and preparedness positions.
