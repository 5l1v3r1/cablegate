Â¶1.  (SBU) On November 8, DCM raised points in Ref A to 
Argentine Under Secretary for Foreign Policy Luis Cappagli. 
Cappagli stated that the GOA would vote for the resolution 
condemning the U.S. embargo on Cuba, but noted that the GOA 
had not decided on whether it will support the Australian 
amendment expressing concern about Cuba's human rights 
situation.  Cappagli noted that Argentina remains concerned 
over Cuba's human rights situation, but is concerned that 
supporting the Australian amendment would dilute the 
resolution condemning the U.S. embargo.  (NOTE: The GOA 
abstained on the Cuba human rights resolutions in 2004 and 
2005.)
