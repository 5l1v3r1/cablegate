¶1.  (U) Summary: Typhoon Chanchu, following its strike on 
the Philippines, headed toward eastern Guangdong Province 
late last week with landfall on Thursday, May 18. 
Preparing for the typhoon's landfall, over 600,000 persons 
were evacuated, with numbers reaching more than one million 
by the time the typhoon departed.  Reports indicate that 23 
persons were killed by floods and landslides triggered by 
the typhoon in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces.    The National 
Disaster Reduction Center, Ministry of Civil Affairs, 
estimated total economic loss for Guangzhou RMB 1.47 
billion (USD 184 million), for Fujian, RMB 3.68 billion 
(USD 459 million).  Provincial reports indicate 3.8 million 
acres of Fujian farmland have been damaged with another 
520,000 acres damaged in Guangdong.  End Summary. 
 
Typhoon Leaves 23 Dead, One Million Evacuees 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) The powerful typhoon struck China on Thursday, May 
18, leaving at least 21 people dead: 15 in Fujian province 
due to floods and landslides triggered by the typhoon; and, 
eight in Guangdong Province.  At the same time, media 
reports say 28 Vietnamese fishermen were killed and many 
more were missing after their boats sank or went missing in 
Chinese waters due to the storm, though Chinese naval 
vessels provided food and water to survivors found on 
Vietnamese fishing boats following the typhoon.  The 
Chinese government announced that over 100,000 vessels had 
been ordered back to port before the typhoon hit the area. 
After making landfall, the typhoon was downgraded to a 
tropical storm and returned to the sea southeast of 
Shanghai late Thursday evening. 
 
¶3.  (U) On Wednesday, May 17, before the typhoon made 
landfall, approximately 300,000 people were evacuated from 
their homes in Fujian Province with an additional 320,000 
people evacuated along the coast of Guangdong Province. 
Following Typhoon Chanchu's landfall, the number of 
evacuees in these two provinces reached more than one 
million people.  Evacuees are currently being housed in 
tents, schools, government warehouses or staying with 
relatives. 
 
Damages Estimated at USD 600 Million 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (U) At the Central Government level, Vice Premier Hui 
Liangyu expressed great concern over the typhoon.  The 
National Disaster Reduction Center, Ministry of Civil 
Affairs, estimated total economic losses for Guangdong at 
approximately RMB 1.5 billion (USD 184 million), and for 
Fujian at 3.7 billion (USD 459 million).  There have been 
no requests for international or central government 
assistance so far and relief efforts are being handled 
primarily by provincial and local governments, though a 
joint delegation made up of representatives from eight 
ministries arrived in Fujian to advise recovery operations. 
Hope Weiner of the International Federation of the Red 
Cross stated that the China Red Cross was sending a team 
down to the affected area to investigate.  To date, the CRC 
has only sent limited supplies, such as blankets, to the 
regional Red Cross offices in Fujian and Guangdong.
