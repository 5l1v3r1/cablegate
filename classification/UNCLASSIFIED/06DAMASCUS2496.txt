SUBJECT: EMBASSY DAMASCUS PROPOSAL FOR 2006 AMBASSADORS' 
FUND FOR REFUGEES 
 
REF: STATE 41367 
 
¶1.  (U) Request:  Post requests $20,000 from the 
Ambassadors, Fund for Refugees for the Syrian Arab Red 
Crescent (SARC) to buy X-ray equipment for a clinic under 
construction in the Damascus neighborhood of Saida Zeinab. 
 
¶2.  (U) Background and justification:  The SARC was founded 
in 1942 and became an implementing partner of UNHCR in 1992. 
The SARC conducts home visits and provides basic services to 
those referred by UNHCR, including medical services to 
refugees and needy Iraqis, out of rented clinic space in 
Saida Zeinab, a populous suburb of Damascus.  The 
organization is building its own medical clinic on donated 
land in Saida Zeinab to expand the provision of these 
services.  Currently, the SARC refers Saida Zeinab patients 
to other facilities for x-rays, so the new equipment would 
fill a gap in existing health services.  The March 2006 
"Assessment of the Situation of Iraqi Refugees in Syria" by 
UNHCR, UNICEF and WFP highlighted the need to expand health 
services to the estimated 450,000 displaced Iraqis in Syria, 
many of whom reside in Saida Zeinab. 
 
¶3.  (U) Estimated budget:

TOTAL                                     20,000.00 
 
¶4.  (U) Implementation:  Emboff and the Amman-based Regional 
Refcoord will monitor the program. 
 
¶5.  (U) Post has the authority and procedures in place to 
transfer these funds to the SARC.
