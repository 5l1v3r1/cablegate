  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  OBAMA'S VISIT TO ASIA 
 
"A look at Obama's Asia trip" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily Overseas Edition (Renmin 
Ribao Haiwaiban)(11/10)(pg 6): "Obama's decision to visit East Asia 
at a time when the U.S. economy is in recession, various domestic 
reforms are facing obstacles, and the U.S. foreign policy focus is 
on the war in Afghanistan and the war against terrorism demonstrates 
the Obama administration's emphasis on Asia, especially on East 
Asia.  The visit also proves that the United States' East Asian 
policy has taken shape, and sends a clear signal that the United 
States is returning to Asia.  After taking office, in a change from 
the Bush administration, Obama has advocated multilateralism, 
seeking broad cooperation with Asian nations in areas of common 
interest.  The Obama administration currently needs a more practical 
relationship with China; its desire to contain China is diminishing. 
 However, U.S. efforts to consolidate its alliance with Japan are an 
effective way to prevent its East Asian interests from being damaged 
while it is containing China.  China should adopt a more practical 
approach to dealing with Obama's new Asian policy, one that 
addresses trilateral relations between the U.S., Japan and China." 
 
¶2.  CHINA'S DIPLOMACY 
 
"China needs to be flexible to plaster over differences" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/10)(pg 14): "The concept of a G2, with the 
U.S. and China jointly managing the international system, is 
gradually taking clearer shape and is being emphasized by the 
international community.  This reflects the subtle but profound 
changes in China's bilateral relations caused by China's rise. 
However, tactically speaking, moving towards a bi-polar 
international system too early will not be beneficial for China's 
development since it would provoke hostility from the U.S. and put 
more pressure on China to shoulder international burdens.  China 
should skillfully use the multi-polar system to ease these 
pressures.  In fact, the trend is towards a three pillar system 
centered on the United States, Europe and China.  In the future, 
China should place more emphasis on Europe to ease pressure for a 
U.S.-China bi-polar system.  In the Asia-Pacific region, it is 
important for China to accurately judge the United States and make 
use of 'the U.S. factor.'  The U.S. factor is a mixed blessing for 
China.  It is crucial for China to learn how to deal with the U.S. 
in the Asia-Pacific region and change the U.S. from an enemy into a 
friend.  This requires further thought on China's part, on both the 
tactical and strategic level: how to allay the concerns of the 
United States and Japan over China's rise and their resulting 
demands on China." 
 
¶3.  U.S.-JAPAN RELATIONS 
 
"The 'quarrel' between Japan and the United States is not harmful" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(11/10)(pg 5): "The U.S.-Japan alliance meets the 
national security needs of both countries.  Experts said that the 
leaders of the United States and Japan will discuss issues such as 
aid to Afghanistan and environmental protection [during President 
Obama's visit to the region].  The 'Futenma airbase dispute' is 
nothing but the two countries trying to test each other's red lines. 
 Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama intends to create a more 
equitable alliance with the United States and is using this 
opportunity to test how far Japan can go if it stops following the 
U.S.  At the same time, the U.S. hopes that the Futenma issue will 
not be the domino that destroys the entire plan for U.S. troops in 
Japan.  In the end, though, the two countries need each other on 
many other issues."
