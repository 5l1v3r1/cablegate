¶1. SUMMARY: In a February 19-March 9 joint operation, FRONTEX border 
security guards from seven EU countries are screening passengers at 
Frankfurt Airport to curb illegal entry to the EU.  FRONTEX 
officials are pleased with the operation, which has netted fifteen 
detentions, mainly from South America.  The operation may provide 
useful insights for DHS initiatives at European hub airports.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
Ongoing Operation "Amazon II" 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. FRONTEX, the EU Border security cooperation agency, deployed 
twenty-nine experts from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, 
Portugal, and Spain to eight European airports to reduce air 
travelers' misuse of visas and other travel documents for illegal 
entry to the European Union.  The current operation -- Amazon II -- 
is a follow-on to a similar operation that took place in November 
¶2006.  According to a recent FRONTEX press release, airports in 
Amsterdam, Barcelona, Lisbon, Madrid, Milan, Paris, and Rome are 
participating in this operation in addition to Frankfurt Airport. 
 
DHS Frankfurt Observes Operation 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3. Post's senior DHS representative spent a day at the Frankfurt 
airport observing FRONTEX operations, whose officers are pleased 
with their results.  In particular, the Spanish customs and 
immigration officials were extremely useful in dealing with flights 
from Latin America.    The FRONTEX border control officials wear 
their home country uniforms but can question and detain suspects 
under the supervision of host country (German) officials.  The power 
to detain and question people considerably enhances FRONTEX's 
effectiveness in assisting German border control.  Since February 
19, the operation in Frankfurt has yielded fifteen detentions of 
improperly documented travelers, largely from Latin America, en 
route to destinations such as Spain and Portugal. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶4. The FRONTEX Amazon II operation reflects FRONTEX concerns over 
the use of EU hub airports like Frankfurt for malafide travelers 
from countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia.  As the USG 
considers stationing DHS/Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Liaison 
Officers at Frankfurt Airport under the Immigration Advisory Program 
(IAP), the FRONTEX initiative could provide valuable insights.
