SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-TAIWAN ARMS SALES 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage July 15 on President Ma Ying-jeou's interview with a German 
newspaper and KMT Vice Chairman John Kuan's remarks regarding 
Taiwan's unification with China; on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's 
financial crisis and the impact on Taiwan; and on the rescue effort 
for eight missing Taiwan businessmen in waters off Madagascar.  In 
terms of editorials and commentaries, an editorial in the 
mass-circulation "Apple Daily" warned the Ma Administration that 
being ambiguous regarding arms procurement from the United States 
will jeopardize the United States' willingness to defend for Taiwan, 
and people in Taiwan will cast doubt on Ma's willingness to defend 
Taiwan's democracy as well.  End summary. 
 
"To Protect Democracy, Ma Must Demonstrate His Will" 
 
The mass-circulation "Apple Daily" [circulation: 520,000] 
editorialized (7/15): 
 
"Although cross-Strait relations have made admirable and 
ground-breaking progress with respect to the three links and 
tourism, it is more and more worrisome where political and national 
defense developments are leading.  What on earth is going on in 
[Taiwan President] Ma Ying-jeou's mind?  It is really suspicious. 
 
"Just look at the most recent development.  Yesterday, news [in 
Taiwan] cited China's 'Wen Wei Po' as reporting that KMT Vice 
Chairman John Kuan said in China that the KMT genuinely hopes that 
if the KMT stays in power for a long time, peaceful unification with 
China will be achieved. ... 
 
"And look at an earlier development.  [United States] White House 
National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley personally telephoned 
[Taiwan's] National Security Council Secretary-General Su Chi not 
long ago and took the initiative to mention that the United States 
has suspended its arms sales to Taiwan.  Why did the United States 
make this move?  Part of the reason is that [United States President 
George W.] Bush does not want to upset China before the Olympic 
Games and before he steps down.  In addition, Su asked to suspend 
arms procurement when he met with [United States] Senator [Joseph] 
Biden's chief assistant [Frank Jannuzi] recently.  The reason that 
Su dared to do so is because Ma had expressed his intention to the 
United States about suspending the arms procurement when Ma was 
elected [president in March]. 
 
"As a result, in less than one short month, the Taiwan government 
has told the United States it will suspend the arms procurement. 
The United States followed up by suspending arms sales to Taiwan. 
If one links up Ma, Su, and Kuan's [moves], how can people not worry 
about the development of the Ma Administration's cross-Strait 
policy?  Even if Ma has guaranteed no unification, no independence, 
and no use of force during his term, things seem to be in chaos; how 
can people not feel perplexed? 
 
"The so-called 'suspension' of the arms procurement is just a 
semantic smokescreen, which sounds as if the arms procurement will 
proceed in the future.  However, Bush is finishing his term soon. 
It is likely that the successor [to Bush] will stop selling arms to 
Taiwan, especially if [Democratic presidential candidate Barack] 
Obama is elected [United States President]. 
 
"If Taiwan does not procure arms anymore, Taiwan will not only leave 
its door open in terms of national defense and lose all the 
bargaining chips with China, but it will also be unable to have the 
United States and Japan's trust and security commitment.  At that 
time, Taiwan will be something that China can get easily. 
 
"Taiwan's [ambiguous] attitude with regard to national defense will 
definitely weaken the United States and Japan's willingness to 
defend for Taiwan.  [The United States and Japan] will also question 
Taiwan's strategic implications.  The reason that Taiwan procures 
arms is to maintain a certain equilibrium, not to oppose China. ..."
