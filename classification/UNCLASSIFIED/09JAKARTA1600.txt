REFLECT INDONESIA'S RESILIENCE AND INCREASED STABILITY 
 
JAKARTA 00001600  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  Indonesia's resilience to the global economic 
downturn and prospects for improved economic performance following 
President Yudhoyono's peaceful re-election supported a recent 
upgrade of Indonesia's sovereign debt ratings and upward revisions 
of 2009-2010 economic growth forecasts.  Moody's Investors Service 
upgraded Indonesia's foreign- and local-currency sovereign debt 
ratings to Ba2 from Ba3, with a stable outlook, on September 16. 
Indonesia's sovereign rating is now two notches below investment 
grade, according to both Moody's and Fitch, with Standard and Poor's 
rating one notch lower.  Improving conditions also prompted the 
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to raise economic growth 
forecasts for Indonesia to 4.3 percent in 2009 (up from 3.5 and 3.6 
percent respectively) and to 5.4 percent in 2010 (up from 5.0 
percent).  Indonesia was also recognized by the World Bank Group as 
Asia's most active reformer of business regulations in 2008/09 in 
the Doing Business 2010 report, released September 9.  End summary. 
 
 
Ratings Upgrade Cites Improving Macroeconomic Management, Credit 
Profile and Success in Containing Systemic Risk From Terrorism

¶2. (U) Moody's rating upgrade highlighted Indonesia's improving 
macroeconomic management and credit profile, supported by ongoing 
policy prudence, structural reforms and appropriate debt management. 
 Indonesia's relatively low budget deficits and strong economic 
growth have reduced Indonesia's general government debt and private 
external debt to lower than its peer medians, according to Moody's. 
Moody's noted the re-election of pro-reform incumbent President 
Yudhoyono will broadly ensure policy continuity and possibly lead to 
a deepening of policy and structural reforms.  Moody's also 
recognized that Indonesia's increasingly effective political 
institutions and security apparatus had contained systemic risk from 
terrorist attacks. 
 
¶3. (U) Several market analysts have predicted Indonesia's sovereign 
debt could gain investment grade in the next two to five years, 
though recognizing the significant progress needed to achieve that 
goal.  In its upgrade, Moody's noted that if Indonesia's sovereign 
creditworthiness is to further improve, it will need a strong 
foreign currency reserve position and factors such as a more 
developed domestic capital market and a larger institutional 
investor base will assume greater significance. 
 
World Bank and ADB Raise 2009 and 2010 Economic Growth Forecasts

¶4. (U) The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) also 
raised their economic growth forecasts for Indonesia to 4.3 percent 
in 2009 (up from earlier forecasts of 3.5 and 3.6 percent, 
respectively) and to 5.4 percent in 2010 (up from earlier forecasts 
of 5.0 percent) in their most recent outlooks.  These forecasts 
expect domestic demand to remain the major driver of growth in 2009, 
supported by a recovery in the external sector, and growing 
government consumption as the fiscal stimulus is disbursed.  2010 
growth is expected to accelerate on stronger investment, more 
readily available credit and improved confidence among investors as 
global growth and commodity prices recover.  The ADB cautions that 
risks to its outlook include higher than expected oil prices, which 
would drive inflation and hurt consumption, and dry weather that 
could damage harvests.  The World Bank expects Indonesia to approach 
its potential of around 6.0 to 6.5 percent growth in 2011, as the 
world economy recovers. 
 
Indonesia Recognized as Asia's Most Active Reformer 
in Doing Business 2010

¶5. (U) Indonesia also garnered positive attention from the IFC and 
World Bank in the Doing Business 2010 report.  Indonesia moved up in 
the global ease of doing business rankings from 129 to 122 and was 
recognized as Asia's most active reformer.  Indonesia continues to 
lag regional peers such as Singapore (ranked first globally); 
Thailand (ranked 12), Malaysia (ranked 23) and Vietnam (ranked 93). 
According to the Doing Business 2010 report, Indonesian business 
regulation reforms in 2008/2009 included cutting the time required

to start a business by 16 days (from 76 to 60 days) in 2008/2009 and 
the time to transfer property by 17 days (from 39 to 22 days) and 
strengthening of disclosure requirements for related-party 
transactions, improving the protection of investors.
