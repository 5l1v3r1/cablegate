SUBJECT: EMBASSY KABUL'S DESIGNATED IRAN WATCHER 
 
REF: STATE 135322 
 
 Â¶1.  Embassy Kabul has carefully considered how we can best 
meet the request that we provide high-quality Iran-watching 
capabilities using existing staff.  We have designated the 
officer in the Political Section whose portfolio includes 
regional issues, including Iran, as our Iran-watcher.  This 
position is currently held by Aaron Jensen, to be replaced by 
Martin Murphy, arriving at post on September 3.  Mr. Murphy 
will work closely with the PRT officer in Herat, Vangala Ram, 
who speaks Dari.  The Iran-watcher will travel to Herat, and 
the two officers will consult in Kabul during Mr. Ram's 
regular trips to the Embassy.  Other officers in the embassy 
will support the Iran-watcher functions, including 
facilitating contacts with Iranian expatriates in Afghanistan.
