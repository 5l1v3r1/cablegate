End Summary 
 
China's Role in the Copenhagen Conference 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  At the December 17 regularly scheduled Foreign Ministry press 
briefing, Spokesperson Jiang Yu said that China would play a 
constructive role and enhance cooperative efforts to reach a "fair, 
reasonable, balanced, and achievable" result at the UN Climate 
Change Conference in Copenhagen.  China had always maintained a 
positive and constructive approach to the Copenhagen Conference 
negotiations, Jiang claimed. 
 
¶3.  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao would attend multiple bilateral 
meetings in Copenhagen December 17 before giving a keynote speech to 
the conference on December 18.  Although information on Wen's 
scheduled meetings had not been released, Jiang noted that Wen's 
speech would state China's position on combating climate change and 
enhancing cooperation.  Jiang also asserted that Denmark, as the 
host of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, should make 
"unremitting efforts" towards positive results. 
 
Xi Jinping in South Korea 
------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Jiang announced that during his visit to Seoul, Chinese Vice 
President Xi Jinping met with President Lee Myung-bak December 17 to 
discuss "strategic partnership cooperation" between China and South 
Korea.  Jiang said Xi told Lee that China supported safeguarding the 
peace and stability of the Korean peninsula, as well as 
reconciliation between the two Koreas.  Xi encouraged South Korea to 
seize current opportunities to make joint efforts to create 
conditions favorable to resuming the Six-Party Talks. 
 
¶5.  During a luncheon hosted by South Korea's business community, Xi 
outlined a proposal to promote PRC-ROK trade.  The details of the 
proposal, Jiang stated, would be available in future press 
statements. 
 
 
Uighur Asylum Seekers 
--------------------- 
 
¶6.  The 22 Uighurs seeking asylum in Cambodia were "involved in 
crimes" and were being investigated by Chinese authorities, said 
Jiang, adding that international refugee protection systems should 
not be a means for criminals to evade lawful punishment. 
 
 
Xi Jinping to Cambodia 
---------------------- 
 
¶7.  Chinese Vice President Xi would meet with Cambodian Prime 
Minister Hun Sen and Cambodian King Norodom Sihamoni during a trip 
to Cambodia December 20-22.  Jiang emphasized that China hoped Xi's 
visit would help foster good relations, active cooperation, and 
friendship with Cambodia.
