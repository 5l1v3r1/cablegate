SUBJECT:  SOUTH/CENTRAL SOMALIA FOOD DISTRIBUTION 
UPDATE, APRIL 2006. 
 
 
Summary 
 
¶1.  From February to mid-April, 2006, a total of 25 251 
MTs of FFP Title II emergency food aid has been 
distributed to 1,296,818 victims of the drought in 
South and Central Somalia.  This represents a 44 % 
achievement in comparison to planned levels.  The food 
pipeline will remain stretched and distributions lower 
than planned at least through May.  From June to 
September the pipeline will be healthy, and barring a 
major logistical barrier, planning levels should be 
reached. 
 
 
 
WFP Somalia Distributions 
 
¶2.  From the beginning of its drought emergency 
operation in February 2006 to mid-April 2006, WFP 
Somalia has distributed a total of 13 788 MTs of food 
to 775 388 beneficiaries.  This is a 44% achievement 
rate in terms of MTs and 50% in terms of number of 
beneficiaries. 
 
¶3.  It is to be noted that WFP has adopted a 
distribution schedule by 45 day intervals.  Its first 
round scheduled to begin February 15 and end on April 3 
actually began on February 22 and is still ongoing as 
of this writing.  Achievement rate on the basis of that 
45 day cycle is 79% - although it is at least two weeks 
late in its implementation. 
 
¶4.  Regions assisted by WFP/Somalia were Lower and 
Middle Juba (389 140 beneficiaries); Bay (233 748 
beneficiaries); Bakool (97 300 beneficiaries), and Gedo 
(55 200 beneficiaries). 
 
CARE Somalia Distributions 
 
¶5.  CARE Somalia has distributed 11 463 MTs to 521 430 
beneficiaries since February 2006.   Regions covered 
were Gedo (432 228 beneficiaries); Central (61 242 
beneficiaries); Hiran (15 552 beneficiaries), while 
another 12 408 beneficiaries were reached in 
M/Shabelle, Bay and Bakool. 
 
 
Summary of FFP Emergency food aid distributions 
 
¶6.  From February to mid-April, 2006, a total of 25 251 
MTs of FFP Title II emergency food aid has been 
distributed to 1 296 818 victims of the drought in 
South and Central Somalia.  Gedo region has received 
the most (487 428 beneficiaries) while Lower and Middle 
Juba (389 140 beneficiaries), Bay (236 436 
beneficiaries) and Bakool (103 132 beneficiaries) were 
also primary beneficiaries.  M/Shabelle, Hiran, and 
Central regions had a combined 80 682 beneficiaries. 
 
 
 
 
Food aid pipeline 
 
¶7.  The combined (WFP and CARE) food pipeline reflects 
a mere 11 681 MTs either in Somalia or enroute to 
Somalia as of mid-April.  Against the combined monthly 
requirement of 21 700 MTs, this represents 54% 
availability for distribution in the next few weeks. 
Another combined 6 315 MTs are in Mombasa available to 
be trucked or shipped to Somalia while a total of 83 
432 MTs are on the high seas, enroute to Mombasa except 
for 6,000 MTs being shipped directly from Durban to El 
Maan, Somalia. 
 
¶8.  While 80% of the commodities enroute to Mombasa are 
scheduled to arrive by the end of May and would ensure 
a healthy pipeline for at least four months, it is 
 
 
unlikely that they will be available for distribution 
until well into June.  Therefore, distributions for at 
least another month, or through May, are likely to fall 
short of targets.  BELLAMY
