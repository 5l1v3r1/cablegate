¶1.  On 12/27 ESTHOFF visited Council of Agriculture Deep Sea 
Fisheries Director Tsay Tzu-yaw for a read out of the 
Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) 
meeting held at Pohnpei, Micronesia December 12-16. News 
reports had indicated that Taiwan eluded potential sanctions 
at this meeting. Tsay confirmed the news reports and said 
that the Japanese delegation proposed sanctions on Taiwan's 
western Pacific tuna fleet similar to those imposed by the 
International Convention on Conservation of Atlantic Tuna 
(ICCAT) at its meeting in November this year (reftel). Tsay 
said that Taiwan was able to avert the sanctions by 
submitting detailed fishing data demonstrating that Taiwan's 
Pacific fishing activities fell within its allocated quota 
for albacore tuna. Underscoring the importance that Taiwan 
places on retaining its remaining deep-sea fisheries quotas, 
the Director of the Fisheries Administration, Shieh Dah-wen, 
personally headed Taiwan's delegation to the WCPFC. 
 
 
¶2.  Tsay dismissed rumors circulating at the WCPFC meeting 
that Shieh's Deputy, James Sha, might be leaving his 
position in the aftermath of the ICCAT sanctions (Taiwan's 
quota of big-eyed tuna was reduced by 70 percent). He went 
on to say that Sha will continue to be lead shepherd at the 
APEC Fisheries Working Group. Tsay confirmed that the timing 
was on track for the APEC Fisheries Working Group Workshop 
scheduled for May 8 in Taipei.  He said that he looked 
forward to working with the team from OES/OMC on fishing- 
capacity issues during this meeting. PAAL
