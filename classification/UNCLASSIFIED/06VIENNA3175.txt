Â¶1.  Acting EconPol Counselor and PolOff delivered reftel 
demarche on October 25 to Peter Huber, the MFA,s Deputy Head 
of the International Organizations Department.  Huber stated 
that Austria shares the USG concern that there is a trend to 
inject contentious political issues into the UN's human 
rights fora.  Huber said that, in general, EU Member States 
"are not happy" with these resolutions.  He added that 
Austria would coordinate its position with other EU Member 
States.  Pointing to the unbalanced nature of the 
resolutions, Huber underscored that the GoA remains skeptical 
as to the utility of these resolutions.  According to Huber, 
the GoA will develop its final position after input from the 
three relevant MFA Departments  -- Human Rights, Middle East, 
and International Organizations.
