SUBJECT:  KYIV: REFERRAL VALIDATION STUDY RESULTS 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: Embassy Kyiv recently concluded a validation study 
of visas issued in fiscal year 2008 based on A and B referrals. 
During this time period, Post issued 112 visas based on A referrals 
and 707 based on B referrals. The validation study showed no 
overstays within the statistical sample, and Post detected no fraud 
trends with respect to the referral process. End summary. 
 
SAMPLE, DATA COLLECTION, AND METHODOLOGY 
 
¶2. (U) Post conducted its validation study on 98 randomly selected 
applicants from the pool of 112 A referral issuances in fiscal year 
2008 (October 1, 2007 through September 30, 2008), and 372 randomly 
selected applicants from the pool of 707 B referrals during the same 
time period.  Post submitted the sample group to CA/FPP for computer 
verification of entry/exit records.  The study was conducted with a 
95 percent confidence rate and a margin of error of 3.8 percent. 
 
RESULTS 
 
¶3. (U) As of October 7, 2009, Post confirmed that 98 percent of A 
referral applicants issued during the study period traveled to the 
United States and returned on time. The remaining 2 percent did not 
use their visas. With respect to the B referrals, all of the 
applicants used their visas, and 99 percent traveled to the United 
States and returned on time. The remaining one percent (5 out of 367 
applicants in the study sample) were in the United States at the 
time of the study, though they had not violated the terms of their 
visas as of the study date. 
 
¶4. (U) Post is pleased with the 100 percent compliance rate by 
applicants issued visas as a result of a referral (with a 3.8 
percent margin of error). This result confirms the integrity of 
Post's referral program, and Post will continue to uphold high 
standards for referrals.
