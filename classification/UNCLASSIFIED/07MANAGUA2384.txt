SUBJECT: RAINS STOP; FLOOD RECOVERY CONTINUES 
 
REF: A. MANAGUA 2372 
     ¶B. MANAGUA 2366 
 
¶1.  Subject:  The persistent heavy rains that flooded 
Nicaragua the past weeks have let up, and relief is starting 
to flow to victims of the October flooding.  President Ortega 
called together a meeting of donors on October 23 to urge for 
international assistance in response to the second natural 
disaster to hit Nicaragua in 52 days; however, the GON's 
National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation, and 
Response (SINAPRED) is still in the process of putting 
together a comprehensive assessment report on needs 
priorities from the October flooding.  On October 25, USAID 
signed an agreement with the Adventist Development Relief 
Agency (ADRA) for emergency relief in three departments 
affected by the October floods.  The GON released on October 
23 its updated, but still preliminary, report on flood 
damages that shows an increased number of victims than 
earlier reported.  There are no known U.S. citizen casualties 
from the flooding.  End Summary. 
 
Ortega Makes His Pitch 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶2.  On October 23, President Ortega met with representatives 
of the donor community.  He started off by noting the forest 
fires in Southern California, saying that many countries were 
suffering form natural disasters because of global climate 
change.  Ortega noted that after Felix, the October flooding 
was the second national disaster in 52 days.  He then 
launched into a diatribe against Nicaragua's "untouchable 
debt service" that is impeding Nicaragua's ability to respond 
to the needs of its own people, and he called for a 
restructuring of the terms and conditions for Nicaragua's 
internal debt.  It's like having a "gun to our head," Ortega 
complained. 
 
¶3.  At the October 23 meeting, the GON also asked for the 
following sums to meet the ongoing needs generated by 
Hurricane Felix and the October flooding (amounts given in 
U.S. Dollars): 
 
2.7 million for food purchases; 
8 million for housing; 
52 million for vital infrastructure; 
2 million for risk management; 
9 million for health; 
15 million for agricultural rehabilitation; 
5 million for fisheries rehabilitation; and 
6 million for forestry. 
 
The GON did not produce a comprehensive list of needs 
directly resulting from the October flooding; however, the 
preliminary needs that the GON set forth for two departments 
include:  1,500 mattresses; food for one month for 3600 
people; 1,500 gallons of fuel for cleaning efforts; and 
antifungal medications. 
 
Better but still sketchy numbers

¶4.  Also on October 23, the Nicaraguan Civil Defense 
authorities released updated, but still preliminary, numbers 
for flood-related damages that show increased numbers of 
victims.  The October 23 report enumerates:  31,237 people 
(6,659 families) affected; 6,376 persons evacuated; 10 
deaths; and two missing persons.  The report lists 
significant infrastructure damage:  1,972 dwellings, of which 
33 have been completely destroyed; 1,707 destroyed latrines; 
413 contaminated wells; 22 partially damaged bridges, 1,314 
kilometers of damaged roads, 59 broken sewers, and multiple 
damaged retaining walls and other infrastructure weaknesses. 
Health authorities have also registered 161 cases of 
leptopirosis in one community in Chinandega, with two 
corresponding deaths.

¶5.  On October 25, USAID signed an agreement with the 
Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) for USD 50,000 
in USAID/OFDA funds to assist in the relief effort of the 
October flood victims.  Under the terms of the agreement, 
ADRA will concentrate its efforts on providing needed relief 
supplies to 1000 families in the most affected areas to 
alleviate suffering.  This relief effort will benefit 48 
percent of the total of families affected in three 
departments of Matagalpa (600 families), Madriz (240 
families), and Chinandega (600 families).  Included in these 
relief supplies are food rations, mattresses, kitchenware, 
and cooking kits.  In addition to USAID's assistance to 
families under the ongoing Food Security Program, 10% of food 
commodities currently in the country from USAID P.L. 480 
partners (ADRA and Project Concern International) -- valued 
at USD 26,210 -- will be distributed to flood victims in the 
departments of Jinotega, Chinandega, Madriz, and Matagalpa. 
These are additional beneficiaries that are not covered by 
the Food Security Program.  USAID/OFDA has deployed two 
disaster experts to Nicaragua to assist with the ongoing 
assessments and coordination. 
 
¶6.  Regarding Hurricane Felix response, USAID received on 
October 25 an additional USD 300 thousand from USAID/OFDA for 
the expansion of economic rehabilitation activities in the 
Atlantic Autonomous Region North (RAAN) of Nicaragua and is 
working with ADRA on program proposals for these funds. 
USAID Deputy Director will fly to the RAAN on October 26 to 
participate in Donor Group meetings with the Mayor of Bilwi 
and the Governor of the RAAN.  Vice Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Valdrack Janetschke will accompany the Donor Group on 
the visit.  Also, on October 30, there will be a signing 
ceremony for an additional USD 3 million for World Food 
Program (WFP) food, at which both Ambassador Trivelli and 
Foreign Minister Santos will speak. 
 
Other Donor Contributions

¶7.  While there is no coordinated mechanism to assess donor 
contributions, the UN Emergency Technical Team (UNETE) 
published on October 24 a list of international civil society 
organization contributions that includes: 
 
UNICEF - USD 2,000 for medical assistance; 500 blankets 
 
CARE - 1,096 basic food packages 
 
German Agro Action (GAA) - 3.5 days of food for 900 persons; 
4 100 yard rolls of plastic sheeting 
 
Plan International - 1,065 mattresses 
 
World Vision - 
     *Chinandega - food for 7 days, medicine, blankets and 
plastic sheeting for 265 families in shelters 
     *San Francisco Libre (department of Managua) - water, 
food and medicine to 54 families in shelters

¶8.  The Consular warden in Matagalpa reported that she was 
aware of one U.S. citizen whose domicile was flooded with 
over a meter of mud; however, the AmCit has not made contact 
with Embassy nor made any request for assistance.  There have 
been no further flood-related calls to the Embassy, and we 
have no direct knowledge of any U.S. victims.

¶9.  The October 21 Embassy press release generated very 
positive articles about USG assistance in the press on 
October 22.  It is worthwhile noting that October 24 
CID/Gallup survey shows a high percentage of Nicaraguans who 
are aware of the USG's disaster relief assistance in response 
to Hurricane Felix, despite GON efforts to highlight instead 
the assistance promised by ideologically favored partners 
such as Venezuela and Cuba.  47 percent of survey respondents 
indicated that they believed the US had helped more than any 
other country, vs., 29 percent for Venezuela, and 4 percent 
for Cuba.
