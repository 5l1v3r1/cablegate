REF: STATE 125135 
 
Â¶1.  (U) Minister of Defense Lieutenant General Germain 
Niyoyankana assured the Ambassador November 28 that Burundi 
will indeed honor its pledge to provide a third battalion of 
Burundian troops for the African Union Mission to Somalia 
(AMISOM), and that Burundi stands ready to promise further 
battalions if needed.  Niyoyankana said his troops would 
benefit from an additional ACOTA training visit, but they 
stand prepared to depart mid-January without such refresher 
training if necessary.  The MinDef welcomed USG equipment and 
logistical support, acknowledging that donor assistance is 
necessary if Burundi is to continue to participate in AMISOM. 
 Niyoyankana noted it would be useful if an additional 850 
desert uniforms for the pledged third battalion could be 
procured and delivered in mid-January - the same time as 
1,700 desert uniforms destined for the battalions already in 
theatre are scheduled to arrive in Bujumbura.
