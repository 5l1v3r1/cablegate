SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - SUDAN 
 
 
¶1. This Travel Warning for Sudan alerts U.S. citizens to 
the threat from armed conflicts and warns of continued 
threats from terrorism in Sudan.  This supersedes the 
Travel Warning issued for Sudan on October 5, 2006. 
 
¶2. The Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens 
against all travel to Sudan, particularly in the Darfur 
area, where violence between government forces and various 
armed militias continues.  Americans and other westerners 
have been victims of carjackings and armed robbery while 
traveling in Sudan. Land travel at night should be 
avoided. 
 
¶3. Travelers are reminded that the U.S. Government has 
received indications of terrorist threats aimed at 
American and western interests in Sudan.  Terrorist 
actions may include suicide operations, bombings, or 
kidnappings.  U.S. citizens should be aware of the risk of 
indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets in public 
places, which include tourist sites and locations where 
westerners are known to congregate, and commercial 
operations associated with U.S. or western interests.  As 
physical security remains high at official facilities, 
terrorists may turn towards softer targets, such as 
residential compounds. 
 
¶4. Travel outside of the capital city of Khartoum and the 
adjacent town of Omdurman is potentially dangerous. 
Sporadic fighting instigated by militias often is reported 
in the southern parts of the country.  Threats have been 
made against foreigners working in the oil industry in 
Upper Nile state. 
 
¶5. Americans who must travel to Sudan despite this Travel 
Warning must possess a valid passport with at least six 
months of validity and a Sudanese visa.  Travelers must 
apply for a visa in their own country of residence.  In 
August 2006, five foreigners, including two Americans, 
were arrested and detained in Darfur after entering Sudan 
via the Chadian border town of Banal without the 
appropriate documentation.  Several of these individuals 
had solicited and obtained escorts in Chad who allegedly 
promised to facilitate entry into Sudan but who were 
ultimately unable to follow through with their 
commitments.  Without appropriate travel documents and 
permits, travelers may face arrest and detention for 
crimes including illegal entry, publication of false 
information, and espionage.  If convicted, sentences range 
from deportation to life in prison or the death penalty. 
 
¶6. The Sudanese Government requires that anyone seeking to 
enter the Darfur area, and some other areas, obtain a 
special travel permit.  This includes humanitarian 
workers, journalists, photographers, and other media 
employees.  Separate additional permits are required to 
take photographs, even for private use, and to conduct 
journalism anywhere in Sudan. Additional information about 
entry requirements for Sudan and other countries is 
located on the State Department's Bureau of Consular 
Affairs web site at http://travel.state.gov. 
 
¶7. U.S. citizens are strongly urged to register with the 
Embassy in Khartoum or through the State Department's 
Travel Registration website, 
https://travelregistration.state.gov.  By registering, 
American citizens make it easier for the Embassy to 
contact them in case of emergency.  The U.S. Embassy is 
located at Sharia Ali Abdul Latif, Khartoum; tel. (249- 
183) 774-701/2/3 (outside Sudan); tel. (0183) 774-701/2/3 
(inside Sudan.)  For after-hours emergencies, please call 
249-183-774-705 and leave a message with Post One for the 
 
STATE 00125277  002 OF 002 
 
 
Consular Duty Officer.
