SUBJECT: HUMANTIARIAN OPERATIONS CENTER - HERE TO HELP 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  Kuwait's Humanitarian Operations Center (HOC) can 
assist NGOs with shipping of their supplies (even free shipping) to 
Iraq, obtaining Kuwait and Iraq customs clearances, and Kuwait entry 
visas for medical cases granted treatment in Kuwait or abroad.  The 
HOC desires to increase humanitarian shipments by NGOs to Iraq, but 
to do that, needs to hear from NGOs on what is needed and where. 
GOK has pledged its support to the HOC for as long as needed.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  Emboff attended a briefing on Kuwait's Humanitarian Operations 
Center (HOC) given by HOC Director (and former Kuwaiti Chief of 
Staff) LTG Ali Al-Mu'men and LTC Bob Lehman, USARCENT, at the United 
Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) HQ in Kuwait City on May 
8, 2007.  Also in attendance were representatives from UNHCR, WHO, 
UNDP, France, Denmark, IOM-Iraq, UNAMI, US Third Army, and NGOs 
(MercyCorps, War Child UK, InterSOS.org, Danish Refugee Council.) 
 
---------------- 
Let's Meet Again 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  LTG Ali opened by commenting that the HOC has seen many changes 
in the last few years.  At first, the HOC used to have daily 
meetings with over 165 different NGOs and aid organizations.  (Note: 
 Out of the approx. 30 people attending the meeting, less than 10 
were from NGOs.  End note.)  The HOC closed after the elections in 
Iraq, but then re-opened later.  Ali said it is better to meet 
face-to-face with NGOs working in Iraq and that the GOK wants to 
know about their activities so they can help.  Meetings such as 
these help information exchange and can generate ideas.  The HOC now 
plans to meet monthly with NGOs or even more frequently as interest 
warrants. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
What the HOC Can Do for NGOs - FREE SHIPPING 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  The HOC's mission is "to facilitate, coordinate and support 
humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq by promoting the 
entrance into Iraq by corporate, International Organization, 
Non-Governmental Organizations, and individual donors and by 
enhancing relationships with Kuwaiti Ministries, NGOs and USAID 
contractors."  HOC officials said they aim to increase the number of 
container loads of humanitarian shipments to Iraq from Kuwait.  The 
HOC can help with logistics and offered to move humanitarian 
supplies free of charge for NGOs.  The HOC recently sent medical 
supplies to the Basrah Medical College.  They have also shipped 
1,650 wheelchairs and school supplies to various locations in Iraq. 
They can reach back to U.S. charities to help them connect donors 
with needed projects in Iraq.  To increase humanitarian shipments, 
the HOC needs to hear from NGOs. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Medical Cases, Visas for Iraqis and Customs Clearances 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶5.  HOC officials also highlighted their role in sending medical 
cases to Kuwait, Europe and the United States for treatment since 
expertise is lacking in Iraq.  Many of these have been pediatric 
cases.  NGOs can recommend Iraqi medical cases requiring treatment 
abroad to the HOC for consideration.  NGOs should also let the HOC 
know where medical supplies are needed so the HOC can assist. 
 
¶6.  In response to a question about Kuwait entry visas for Iraqis 
going through Kuwait for training abroad, LTG Ali said that the HOC 
now has a 99% success rate.  After speaking to the Foreign Minister, 
LTG Ali said humanitarian cases are now approved at the MFA first 
after vetting by Kuwait security services before going to 
Immigration.  The HOC wants to help legitimate NGOs who present visa 
cases.  He emphasized that NGOs should be registered in Kuwait and 
should present cases in a timely manner rather than at the last 
minute.  He said multiple entry visas (for NGOs' Iraqi employees) 
would be very difficult at this time but to contact the HOC and he 
would see what they could do. 
 
¶7.  The HOC can also facilitate customs clearance in Kuwait and 
Iraq.  NGOs mentioned difficulties they were having shipping goods 
through Basrah and Safwan.  Ali said to contact the HOC and he can 
get Iraq customs clearances while the goods are in Kuwait.

HOC Is Here to Stay 
------------------- 
 
¶8.  When asked about how long the HOC will operate, Ali replied that 
the GOK supports the HOC and will continue to do so as long as 
needed.
