¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a post-shipment verification at the Fire Services Department of Hong 
Kong, No. 1, Hong Chong Road, Tsim Sha Tsui East, Kowloon, Hong Kong 
(HK Fire Services).  The items in question are twelve thermal 
imagers exported to HK Fire Services on or about November 4, 2006 
and valued at approximately USD 86,000.  The imagers are the subject 
of export license D349824 and are classified under Export Control 
Classification Number (ECCN) 6A003.  This ECCN is controlled for 
national security (NS) and nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons. 
The exporter was ISG Thermal Systems USA of Lawrenceville, Georgia. 
 
¶3. The HK Fire Services are the fire department of Hong Kong with a 
staff of over 9,000 located throughout Hong Kong.  More information 
is available at www.hkfsd.gov.hk. 
 
¶4.  Mr. Kei-Wai Tai, Assistant Divisional Officer, Planning Group, 
HK Fire Services, provided ECO with documentation confirming receipt 
of the twelve thermal imagers with serial numbers 7366 to 7377.  Mr. 
Tai also provided ECO with a breakdown of the location of the twelve 
units (by serial number and location).  The units are located at 
various fire stations throughout the Hong Kong S.A.R. 
 
¶5.  Visits were arranged at the ECO's request to two of the fire 
stations, namely the Sai Kung Fire Station and the Chung Hom Kok 
Fire Station.  On January 4, 2008, the ECO, accompanied by 
Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan, met with Mr. Tai and 
representatives of the fire station command at the Sai Kung Fire 
Station.  Sai Kung fire station personnel removed the imager from a 
locked case on a fire engine for inspection by the ECO.  The serial 
number on that imager matched the serial number on the listing 
provided by Mr. Tai described in paragraph four, above.  This imager 
is used exclusively by this fire station as part of its 
fire-fighting mission and is kept under lock and key at all times 
(when not in use). 
 
¶6.  Later on January 4, 2008, ECO met with Senior Fireman Chun Pu 
Yip of the Chung Hom Kok fire station.  Mr. Yip removed a thermal 
imager with serial number 7366 from a locked compartment on one of 
the station's fire engines.  He confirmed that the imager is only 
used by this fire station and is kept under lock and key at all 
times (when not in use).
