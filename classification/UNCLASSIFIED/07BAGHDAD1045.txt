MEET WITH THE GOVERNOR OF SULAIMANIYAH 
 
 
This is a Regional Reconstruction Team (RRT) Cable. 
 
¶1.  (U)  RRT Off attended a meeting on March 1 in 
Sulaimaniyah led by Major General Benjamin Mixon, Commanding 
General of the 25th Infantry Division and Brigadier General 
Frank Wiercinski, Assistant Division Commander for the US 
Multi-National Division North in Iraq, with the Governor of 
Sulaimaniyah, Dana Ahmed Majid. The discussion focused on a 
wide range of issues including contracting for USG funded 
projects, border security, and assistance requests. 
 
USG CONTRACTING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Governor said his office needs to know which 
USG funded projects are being carried out and by whom to 
ensure they are in line with the priorities of Sulaimaniyah 
Province.  Dana Majid would like local contractors to have 
the opportunity to bid on the projects.  The Governor added 
that contractors based outside Sulaimaniyah Province lack 
sufficient follow-up maintenance work for the projects. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) General Mixon noted the needs of the local 
government must fit in with the overall USG reconstruction 
plan in Iraq.  He stated the choice of a contractor is based 
on a technical evaluation including past performance.  He 
emphasized the contractor selection process is a competitive 
one. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) General Wiercinski noted that USG contract 
solicitation will be open to Sulaimaniyah companies.  The US 
Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) Area Engineer clarified that 
USG contracts in Sulaimanyiah are processed out of the USACE 
office of Gulf Region Division North District (GRN) in 
Tikrit.  Wiercinski stated that Sulaimaniyah contractors 
would henceforth be included on the contractors list.  On 
March 12, the office of the Governor of Sulaimaniyah 
submitted the names of approved companies registered in 
Sulaimaniyah for inclusion in the list of eligible 
contractors.  It was accepted by the USACE GRN contracting 
office. 
 
RRT COORDINATION 
---------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) Mixon noted to the Governor the need to rely on 
coordination with the Regional Reconstruction Team (RRT) with 
regard to USG funded infrastructure projects.  This is 
particularly important as members of the US Army Civil 
Affairs Team is withdrawing from Sulaimaniyah Province, he 
said.  The Governor expressed his support for the role of RRT 
in Sulaimaniyah Province. 
 
¶6.  (U) RRT Off told MNF-I personnel and the Governor of 
Sulaimaniyah that the RRT will continue to coordinate with 
local officials and the US Army Corp of Engineers on USG 
funded projects after the US Civil Affairs Team departs.  RRT 
Off also noted that the RRT has opened an office in 
Sulaimaniyah available for liaising with the Department of 
Defense and for the public to obtain information on RRT 
programs and USG projects.
