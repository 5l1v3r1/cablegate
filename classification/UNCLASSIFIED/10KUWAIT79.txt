¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 5. 
 
¶2. (U) Summary. On January 28 DCM and Econcouns met with 
Yousef Al-Merag, Director of Disaster relief for the Kuwait 
Red Crescent Society (KRCS), to discuss the status of GoK,s 
pending offer of in-kind assistance to Haiti and to thank him 
for Kuwait's support.  Emboffs explained some of the 
logistical challenges involved in having the USG transport to 
Haiti Red Crescent relief supplies and urged the Red Crescent 
to reach out to international organizations to coordinate 
regarding the type of aid to be provided, and to seek 
additional delivery options.  Al-Merag confirmed the increase 
of GoK support to USD $3.5 million total.  (Note:  USD $1 
million has already been disbursed to the IFRC and 
approximately USD $330,000 of in-kind goods has been 
purchased and is awaiting transport.  End Note.)  Econcouns 
urged KRCS to send the remaining balance as a cash donation 
and Al-Merag stated that the KRCS was working with the IFRC 
to determine how the funds would be spent and alluded to the 
possibility of funding specific reconstruction projects in 
Haiti. End Summary. 
 
¶3.  (U) Econcouns and Al-Merag discussed the status of the 
116 tons of goods which has been prepared by KRCS for 
immediate shipment (ref a).  Econcouns explained the 
restrictions on having the U.S. military ship most of the 
items, which were not considered to be appropriate or 
top-priority items by USAID,s OFDA.  Al-Merag explained that 
he had coordinated with the IFRC in preparing his list of 
items (although acknowledging this had been two weeks ago) 
and expressed surprise that they would not be a priority.  He 
added that all of the goods were palletized and asked whether 
he should return the medical supplies to the Ministry of 
Health.  Econcouns urged him to coordinate with other 
international donor agencies to see what they thought 
priorities on the ground were.  DCM noted that the Haitians 
did appear to have identified an urgent need for tents. 
Al-Merag said that the current palletized shipment had 300 
tents, but that he had an additional 5,000 tents that could 
be made available immediately (estimated weight of 225 tons). 
 Al-Merag agreed to provide specifications on the tents. 
 
¶4. (U)  Al-Merag told Econcouns that the GoK has identified a 
747 passenger aircraft that is available to move 25 tons of 
the in-kind supplies as soon as Saturday.  He expressed 
interest in moving the goods to Miami for onward shipment by 
the U.S. military.  Econcouns reiterated the difficulties 
involved in obtaining U.S. military flights for items that 
were not on the USAID priority list and suggested that he 
coordinate with aid agencies in Haiti to see whether a 
shipment directly to Haiti would make more sense.  Al-Merag 
agreed to contact IFRC to coordinate the movement. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Action Request:  The Red Crescent is an established 
and experienced aid organization.  Post appreciates all the 
efforts to facilitate the shipment of Kuwaiti aid to Haiti, 
but notes that ten days after the GoK first requested 
transportation assistance, we have yet to be able to respond 
definitively.  If Haiti has identified an urgent need for 
tents, facilitating the shipment of these tents to Haiti 
(including, if possible via U.S. military air given the 
weight) would appear to be a win-win scenario.  Department 
guidance appreciated.  End Action Request.
