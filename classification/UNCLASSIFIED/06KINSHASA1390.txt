REF: KINSHASA 1309 
 
¶1. (U) On August 28, the Congolese newspaper Le Potentiel 
printed the Iranian Embassy's denial of the August 6 Sunday 
Times article (reftel), which alleged a DRC-Iran uranium 
smuggling link.  The Times reported that in October 2005 
Tanzanian authorities stopped a shipment of Uranium 238 ore 
from the DRC's Katanga province that was destined for Iran. 
 
¶2. (U) In publicly denouncing the allegations via a press 
release, the Iranian Embassy in Kinshasa stated that it 
"considers the publication of these allegations by the 
Western media to constitute psychological pressure with the 
goal of sullying the peaceful, non-military, nuclear 
activities of Iran in the region.  Thus, in recognizing its 
right to enrich uranium for peaceful, non-military ends, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran submits that the best solution 
dwells only in the pursuit of dialog and negotiation, without 
pressure or threat." 
 
¶3. (U) The Iranian press statement also referenced the 
uranium smuggling denials by the GOI's Supreme Council of 
National Security on August 6 and the denouncements by the 
GDRC on August 9 and the Governor of Katanga on August 16. 
 
¶4. (U) An Agence France Presse article also reported an 
official Iranian response to the allegations, citing the 
GOI's statement that it does not need to import uranium 
because it has its own mines and processing facility.
