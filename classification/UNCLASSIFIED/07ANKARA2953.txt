In Today's Papers 
 
Debate on Amnesty and PKK 
Radikal, Turkiye, Cumhuriyet, Aksam, Yeni Safak, Milliyet, Sabah and 
others:  Responding to journalists, Prime Minister Erdogan said the 
government is not working on a new "return home law," instead, they 
are trying to expand and increase the flexibility of the existing 
Article 221 in the Turkish Penal Code.  Mainstream Sabah quotes PM 
Erdogan as saying "we can stretch article 221 and make it different. 
 The purpose here is to prevent new people from joining the PKK and 
enable those who are in the mountains who have not committed a crime 
to return to their parents. 
 
Okay Gonensin commented in mainstream daily Vatan (12/13):  "A 
compilation of PM Erdogan's statements on the Kurdish issue and on 
terrorism since he came to power demonstrates that he does not have 
a clear vision on these issues.  It looks as if developments force 
him to explain his stance, and later he says something else to deny 
the first statement.  A very similar attitude can be seen in the 
'coming home' or repentance for PKK militants debate.  The support 
of 47 percent of the electorate requires a leader to make his views 
and arguments clear and then proceed accordingly.  We keep hearing 
'social, economic and legal measures' to end terror, yet this 
rhetoric will bounce around like clichs until we see a vision of 
what exactly is meant.  So far, he has handled the issue through a 
crisis management approach and this has not lead to a lasting 
solution.  PM Erdogan, unfortunately, does not seem to have any 
concrete plan even though he makes 'coming home' calls to militants. 
 The gist is that Ankara does not really know whether they want a 
real solution or not.  So, we will keep seeing this lurching 
around." 
 
Derya Sazak commented in mainstream daily Milliyet (12/13): "PM 
Erdogan announced a plan which supposedly both the government and 
military are working on.  Meanwhile, Chief of General Staff General 
Buyukanit expressed concern over the DTP's attitude in the 
parliament by saying 'terrorism has been politicized and legalized.' 
 The general also opposed a possible amnesty saying 'encouraging 
steps for the terrorist organization should be avoided.'  Given the 
events so far, it seems that the military they continue their 
struggle for security on one hand, while they also prevent 
governments from taking civilian steps on the other.  When Ocalan 
was handed over and put in prison in 1999, Turkey had a chance to 
initiate civilian steps that would have been helped to disarm the 
PKK completely.  This opportunity was not taken between 1999 to 2005 
at all.  The year 2007 was spent in the midst of military losses and 
debates over cross border operations.  Now, the government is trying 
to disarm the PKK by using an article in the penal code.  It does 
not seem right to oppose this effort before seeing the actual 
results.  And it does not seem right to denounce the DTP by using 
'the PKK is in the parliament' rhetoric.  Can we let the government 
and all political parties work together on the goal of ending 
terrorism?  Otherwise, we may end up seeing another future statement 
admitting the mistakes of the past." 
 
Reactions to Gen. Buyukanit Remarks that the "PKK has been legalized 
and politicized" 
Mainstream Milliyet reports that an MHP Deputy Chairman criticized 
General Buyukanit's remarks on the PKK and said "Buyukanit's words 
were a confession of failure and, therefore, the TGS Chief should 
resign.  Mainstream Sabah writes that DTP party board member Ahmet 
Turk said to journalists at a TUSIAD reception that "we entered the 
parliament through democratic elections and our aim is to exert 
efforts to decrease tensions in Turkey."  Mainstream Hurriyet says 
the DTP released a written statement calling Buyukanit's words 
"unfortunate" and added the comments will not effect the court case 
on the closure of the DTP. 
 
NGOs Call for Individual-Oriented New Constitution 
Liberal Radikal and leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet report that the 
 
ANKARA 00002953  002 OF 002 
 
 
'Constitution Conciliation Platform' criticized the AKP's 
constitutional draft and said that the NGO's views should be 
considered as the new constitution is prepared.  Meanwhile, speaking 
at his party's Central Administrative Board, CHP leader Deniz Baykal 
said that 'the country is being pulled towards religious hegemony. 
The AKP government presents the new constitutional draft as a 
'civilian constitution,' but it will be the last stop in the 
establishment of a state of religion." 
 
They also carried the communiqu issued by the Platform which is 
composed of a vast variety of Turkish NGOs, including businessmen, 
women rights and bar associations.  The communiqu calls for an 
'individual oriented' new constitution with gender equality. 
Positive discrimination for women is also encouraged.  'Any 
limitation on freedoms and rights must be defined in clear terms 
while parliamentary immunity should be limited to speech' the 
communiqu suggested.  The Constitution Platform plans to introduce 
its recommendations to the parliament soon. 
 
Turkey-EU/Sarkozy 
 
Mainstream Hurriyet and Milliyet report that, at a TUSIAD reception, 
PM Erdogan criticized the EU and French President Sarkozy for 
creating problems in Turkey's EU bid and said "Mr. Sarkozy has one 
attitude in bilateral talks, and adopts another the minute I turn my 
back."
