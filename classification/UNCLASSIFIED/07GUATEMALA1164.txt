REF: STATE 73219 
 
¶1. (U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche and non-paper to Luis 
Carranza, Director of Multilateral Policy in the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA), on June 1.  Carranza said that the MFA 
already sent Guatemala's 60-day report on implementation of 
UNSCR 1747 to New York after coordinating drafting of the 
report with the Ministry of Defense, Immigration, and other 
GOG agencies.  The Permanent Mission of Guatemala in New York 
delivered the report to the UN the week of May 28. 
 
¶2. (U) Carranza commented that Guatemala understands that it 
must abide by the Security Council resolution as it is 
legally binding on all UN member states but noted that the 
resolution is addressed more to countries capable of 
exporting weapons to Iran, such as Guatemala's neighbors, 
than to countries such as Guatemala.  He said that Guatemala 
does not produce or transfer any weapons to Iran and has no 
military industry capable of doing so.  As such, he believes 
that Guatemala is fully implementing the sanctions measures 
of UNSCR 1747.
