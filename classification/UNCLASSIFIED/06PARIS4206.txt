¶1. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY.  At a June 13 information session, 
UNESCO secretariat experts discussed the continuing progress the 
organization has made with regard to desertification and arid zones. 
 After outlining UNESCO's history of action in this area, panelists 
presented some of UNESCO's current programs to combat 
desertification, including the International Hydrological Program's 
(IHP's) Water and Development Information for Arid Lands (G-WADI) 
program, a new Teaching Resource Kit for teachers in arid regions, 
and plans for ecotourism.  The presentation, part of the "60 Minutes 
to Convince" series celebrating UNESCO's 60th year, was timed to 
precede the June 19-21 conference "The Future of Drylands," that 
will take place in Tunis, Tunisia, to mark the International Year of 
Deserts and Desertification.  END INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY. 
 
COMBATING DESERTIFICATION AND CONSERVING WATER 
 
¶2.  Thomas Schaaf, of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) program, 
highlighted UNESCO's progress in combatting desertification over the 
past 50 years.  He discussed how UNESCO's focus has shifted from 
just protecting the natural environment to evaluating human needs as 
well.  UNESCO in recent years has also focused on information 
exchange, trying to replicate successes in one dryland area in 
others.  To that end, Schaaf discussed the successes of the 
Sustainable Management of Marginal Drylands (SUMAMAD) project, a 
program that strives for sustainable conservation in the Arab States 
and Asia.  Another successful sustainable development project lauded 
by the panelists (all from the UNESCO Secretariat) was the IHP's 
G-WADI program, whose goal is to create a global community to 
strengthen global capacity to manage water resources in arid and 
semi-arid areas. Annukka Lipponen, of the Division of Water 
Sciences, presented this program. 
 
NEW INITIATIVES: TEACHER RESOURCE KITS AND ECOTOURISM 
 
¶3.  Panelist Helene Gille, of the Division of Ecological and Earth 
Sciences, described an interesting new project at MAB: Teacher 
Resource Kits, designed to help educate young people about arid and 
semi-arid environments. The lessons are for schoolchildren ages 6-15 
and are meant to be incorporated into a normal curriculum.  The kits 
are specifically targeted for teachers in arid and semi-arid areas, 
so children will not only understand the environment in which they 
live, but also in the long run will be able to combat 
desertification and land degradation.  There are two different kits: 
one for dryland areas and the other for mountainous ones.  So far, 
kits in nine languages have been distributed in over 40 countries. 
 
 
¶4.  Panelist Herve Barre, of the Division of Cultural Policies and 
Intercultural Dialogue, discussed the potential for ecotourism in 
desert and arid regions.  He spoke of the rich natural and cultural 
heritage in the desert, and called ecotourism tourism's "new 
frontier."  He also spoke of ecotourism's potential to promote local 
economies and sustainable development.  One concern raised about 
ecotourism in the desert was that water should not be diverted from 
the local population to satisfy the needs of tourists.
