We conveyed reftel request for an LNO for tsunami relief 
January 6 to Bertrand Besancenot, the Defense Minister's 
Diplomatic Advisor.  The Defense Attache's office made a 
similar request to its contacts at the MOD's Planning and 
Operations center.  We have been advised that the French are 
moving quickly to select a candidate, who may be LCL Chadtal, 
identified in reftel as having received Multinational 
Planning Augmentation Team training.  An as-yet-unidentified 
senior French officer will contact PACOM to coordinate the
