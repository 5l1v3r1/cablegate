SUBJECT: URALS AUDIENCE WANTS MORE ON IPR 
 
¶1. The December 22, 2008 PAS Yekaterinburg DV conference on 
copyright protection in education, science, and academic 
research proved to be wildly successful, leaving the audience 
clamoring for more.  Professor Doris Estelle Long of the John 
Marshall Law School in Chicago was our U.S. expert.  The Russian 
audience of 20 included professors and students of two major 
universities involved in the sphere of copyright in education: 
the Ural State Technical University and the Urals Law Academy. 
 
¶2. The discussion was wide-ranging, covering economic and legal 
models for sharing rights on copyrighted works; laws regulating 
access to and use of electronic education resources; and 
policies of U.S. universities towards publishing education 
materials.  The audience was particularly interested in how 
discoveries or works developed in university-sponsored research 
labs or incubators can be commercialized, and who holds the 
rights to these works.  The audience was also interested in how 
cases involving internet posting without authorization can be 
successfully prosecuted.  Other questions involved digital 
signatures and authentication, and the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act. 
 
¶3. Both the speaker and the audience were greatly satisfied with 
the professional level of the conference. The Yekaterinburg 
audience requested further DVCs to share experience on IPR with 
American specialists and proposed that the next conference be 
held in Spring, 2009.  For this DVC they would like to invite 
their colleagues from Moscow universities.  We believe that 
legal educators, legislators, and law enforcement in the Urals 
region would benefit from further DVCs as well as programs such 
as IPR roundtables. 
 
¶4.  Post appreciates the help of IIP/S in arranging the 
conference.
