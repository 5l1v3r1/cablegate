SUBJECT:  Somali Insurgents Attack Ethiopians 
 
¶1.  Somali insurgents attacked Ethiopian forces camped at the former 
Defense Ministry building in Mogadishu on February 23 between 1730 
and 1800 local time.  In what sources describe as a well-planned 
attack, insurgents caught the Ethiopians off guard with mortars and 
automatic weapons fire.  The attackers escaped. 
 
¶2.  There are no reports of casualties among either the Ethiopians or 
the attackers.  However, according to news reports 10 civilians - 
including four children - were killed and at least 15 were injured by 
Ethiopian artillery fired in retaliation. 
 
¶3.  The attack came as the Ugandan Minister of Defense led a 
delegation to Mogadishu in preparation for the deployment of 1,500 
Ugandan peacekeeping troops as part of the AU/UN approved AMISOM. 
Initial telephonic reports indicated that the Ugandan minister was at 
the Ethiopian compound at the time of the attack and that an 
Ethiopian general had been killed, but neither assertion appears 
true. 
 
¶4.  Sources report that Mogadishu was calm on Saturday and Sunday but 
that unknown numbers of residents continued to evacuate the city.
