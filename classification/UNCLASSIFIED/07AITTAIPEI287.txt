PLAN 
 
 
¶1. Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused its 
coverage February 6 on an unexpected personnel reshuffle in the 
Presidential Office Monday evening, and on Wang You-theng, founder 
of the debt-ridden Rebar Group, who is now in custody in California 
after having been refused admission to Singapore and returned to Los 
Angeles Sunday.  The pro-unification "United Daily News" ran a 
banner headline on page four that said "Stratagems Used to Arrest 
Wang; Taiwan Prosecutors Have Quietly Departed for U.S."  In terms 
of editorials and commentaries, a "United Daily News" editorial 
discussed Taiwan's efforts to arrest Wang You-theng and said there 
is no way Taiwan can use politis to try to influence the 
judiciaries of Singapore and the United States.  An editorial in the 
limited-circulation, pro-independence, English-language "Taiwan 
News," on the other hand, welcomed the DPP government's recent move 
to rectify the names of two state-run enterprises, and said the move 
was in Taiwan's interest.  End summary. 
 
¶2. Wang You-theng Case 
 
"United States and Singapore Both Demonstrate:  No Way Politics Can 
Influence Judiciary" 
 
The pro-unification "United Daily News" [circulation: 400,000] 
editorialized (2/6): 
 
"... Sources said [Taiwan] government authorities have been pushing 
the [Wang You-theng] case from the angle of diplomatic mediation, 
and this is why the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stepped up and 
apologized to the public immediately following its failure to arrest 
[Wang at the Singapore airport].  Taiwan hoped that the 'Taiwan-U.S. 
Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement' could help, but the agreement 
does not require the United States to extradite Taiwan criminals 
back to the island.  Some people thus believe that Taiwan failed to 
get adequate assistance from Singapore and the United States because 
it has not tried 'hard enough' in its negotiations with the two 
countries.  ... 
 
"... In fact, all our efforts will have been in vain if we continue 
to indulge in the idea of being an underdog in terms of foreign 
relations, or if we continue to act according to our own political 
thinking.  This is because both Singapore and the United States are 
countries ruled by law.  Taiwan will only be asking for a snub if it 
tries to use politics to influence the judiciaries of the two 
countries.  This should be viewed as the biggest lesson that we have 
learned. ..." 
 
¶3. Taiwan's Name Change Plan 
 
"Rectification in Taiwan's Interest" 
 
The pro-independence "Taiwan News" [circulation: 20,000] 
editorialized (2/6): 
 
"We strongly support the Democratic Progressive Party government's 
decisions to rectify the names of two state enterprises and to 
finally remove the statues of former autocrat Chiang Kai-shek from 
Taiwan's military installations.  In our view, these decisions are 
long overdue and absolutely necessary.  Although these two moves are 
taking place at the same time, their substantial natures are 
distinct.  The acceleration of the rectification of the names of 
Taiwan official agencies or state enterprises is a reflection of the 
recognition by the Democratic Progressive Party government of the 
actual, existing reality that the sovereignty of Taiwan or, if you 
please, the ROC does not extend to the People's Republic of China, 
but is limited to the 23 million people on the territory of Taiwan, 
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. ...  We urge the DPP to remain resolute 
and accelerate the process of 'rectification,' which is undoubtedly 
in the public interest of all Taiwan citizens."
