SUBJECT: GOLDSTONE DEMARCHE: NO IMMEDIATE RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 15722 
 
¶1.  Ambassador Irving and PolOff met with Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and International Cooperation Acting Legal Advisor 
Vulindlela Kunene, in the unavailability of more senior officers, to 
deliver points per reftel on February 24.  Mr. Kunene offered no 
immediate substantive response regarding Swaziland's position on the 
new Palestinian Observer Mission draft General Assembly resolution, 
and indicated he would speak with the Foreign Minister on the issue 
later that day. 
 
¶2.  Post post has found that, as with many international 
organization issues, the most successful tactic has been to directly 
lobby the Swazi UN Permanent Representative, who has a broad mandate 
and apparently rarely consults with headquarters.
