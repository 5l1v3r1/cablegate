VICKERS SYSTEMS LTD 
REF: A) USDOC 06874 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of 
the Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) and Assistant Director for 
Operations, John Sonderman, conducted a post shipment 
verification (PSV) at Vickers Systems Ltd., Units 18- 
30, 19F Corporation Park, 11 On Lai St. Shatin, Hong 
Kong (Vickers).  The items in question are 246 
hydraulic valves valued at USD 7,307.  No export 
control classification number (ECCN) was included on 
the relevant shipping documents.  The exporter is 
Eaton Corporation of Pharr, Texas. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, 
Vickers Systems Limited has been in existence since 
¶1983.  A review of the relevant website 
(www.eaton.com) indicates that the company is an 
affiliate of Eaton Corporation (the exporter).  Its 
business is importation and exportation of various 
hoses, pumps, valves and related items.  It handles 
various brands including Vickers, Orbit, Eaton, 
Aeroquip and others. 
 
¶3.  The ECO and A/D Sonderman visited Vickers at the 
address referenced above on January 19, 2007 and met 
with Mr. T.T. Kuan, Business Manager and Mr. Lawrence 
Chiu, Distribution Centre Manager.  They provided 
background on Vickers and its business, which 
involves the distribution of Eaton and other brand 
hoses, hose fittings, hydraulic systems and related 
components to Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan and 
the region. 
 
¶4.  Ms. Chiu provided by attachment to separate e- 
mail, shipping and order documentation accounting for 
all 246 valves that are the subject of this PSV.  The 
six customers for these valves appear to be 
industrial companies in Hong Kong and mainland China 
(this is based on a web site review of the customer 
names). 
 
¶5.  Messrs. Chiu and Kuan were only somewhat familiar 
with U.S. export control regulations but stated that 
the parent company (Eaton in the U.S.) assists 
Vickers in this respect.  The ECO provided background 
information on reexport controls. 
 
¶6. At the time visited, Vickers appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the valves since Vickers 
cooperated with the PSV and provided all requested 
information concerning the final disposition of the 
items.  At the same time, the ECO was not able to 
inspect the subject items as they had already been 
delivered to the customers of Vickers. Consistent 
with guidance on reporting of PSVs where the items 
cannot be physically inspected, the ECO recommends 
that this PSV be classified as Limited.
