Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage May 1 on the meeting between Taiwan's Mainland Affairs 
Council Chairperson-designate Lai Shin-yuan and Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) Chairman-designate Chiang Pin-kun on Wednesday 
night; on China's Taiwan Affairs Office's response to Lai's 
appointment; and on the controversy over Taiwan's Soochow 
University's attempt to limit professors' TV appearances.  In terms 
of editorials and commentaries, an op-ed in the centrist, 
KMT-leaning "China Times" tried to work out several messages that 
the appointment of Lai has sent to China, the United States and 
Japan.  End summary. 
 
"Use Lai Shin-yuan to Decrease the Suspicion that [Taiwan's 
President-elect Ma Ying-jeou] Is Pro-China!" 
 
Lai I-chung, the Principal Deputy Director of the Department of 
International Affairs in the DPP, opined in the centrist, 
KMT-leaning "China Times" [circulation: 400,000] (5/1): 
 
"... Although China has not commented openly on the appointment of 
[Taiwan's] Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairperson, this 
appointment undoubtedly is an 'accident' for the Beijing government. 
 If [China] thinks that [Taiwan's President-elect] Ma Ying-jeou had 
no choice but made the appointment in order to expand his base [in 
Taiwan], China can even legitimately reckon that Ma's advocacy does 
not have the support of the majority of the Taiwan people.  If that 
is the case, then why does China have to accommodate Ma and fulfill 
all of Ma's requests?  Against this background, how on earth does 
Beijing view the 'advantageous policies' that Ma proposed, for which 
China's cooperation is required?  Does Beijing see Ma's positive 
moves as [ways] to mitigate cross-Strait relations, or does 
[Beijing] think that Ma is only attempting to ease his predicament, 
in which he is under attack from both left and right, by pressuring 
China? 
 
"Since the appointment has limited effect on [Ma's] claim to expand 
his base in society, it will be more complicated for Ma's government 
to integrate its strategic teams for cross-Strait and foreign 
affairs.  [The appointment] even gives China an excuse to 'listen 
and watch'.  The only explanation for the appointment is that it is 
to respond to international concerns that Ma is too pro-China. 
 
"The United States has now taken a more cautious attitude compared 
to its encouragement to resume dialogue [across the Strait] at the 
end of March.  [The change of attitude] is not only because of the 
'China craze' after the 'Hu-Siew meeting' [in the Boao Forum], but 
also is connected with Ma's strategic thinking that 'cross-Strait 
[relations] outweigh foreign affairs'.  The United States is 
probably worried that Ma's government, because of China's 
opposition, will downgrade the level of the Taiwan-U.S. security 
cooperation in order to ease cross-Strait relations.  Japan is also 
worried, once controversies arise between Japan and China, whether 
Taiwan, at Beijing's request, will close ranks with Beijing to 
confront Japan.  Giving the MAC to someone who is from a 'non-Blue' 
background, whose party [the Taiwan Solidarity Union or TSU] 
supports arms procurement, and whose party leader [TSU spiritual 
leader and former President Lee Teng-hui] has a significant Japan 
connection, indeed has the effect of partly dissolving international 
concerns that Ma is pro-China.  By the same token, considering the 
issue of [Ma] integrating [his] teams, does the international 
community also think that there are still many variables in Taiwan's 
cross-Strait policies and is therefore lowering its expectations? 
..."
