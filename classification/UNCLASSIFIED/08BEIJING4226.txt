  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. G20 SUMMIT 
 
"Role of a stakeholder" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily China Daily 
(Daily, circ 200,000):"The participating countries have competing 
agendas. The host country is awaiting a leadership transfer. It 
would be unrealistic to expect the G20 Summit in Washington DC to 
throw up any long term solutions. Not even specifics, for that 
matter. The world is just not ready to look beyond the present 
financial woes. Perhaps the most we can expect is general, even 
rough, principles or concerted responses....the government reached 
an agreement with Japan, South Korea and South East Asian countries 
on setting up a special fund to cope with the global crisis. There 
is every sign that China will remain active in the international 
rescue scene....ours is a developing country. While communicating 
the political will to stay true to our commitment, President Hu 
should also drive home the message that there is a limit to what we 
can do and what outsiders can expect. " 
 
 
¶2. AMERICA 
 
a. "The 'skin color' of America will not change because of Obama" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (11/14): "Because Obama successfully 
integrated himself into the fabric of America, he was able to win. 
The fact is that Obama should integrate into the fabric of America 
rather than the fabric of America changing for Obama. Tolerance for 
diversity has always been an important part of the American faith. 
Multiculturalism in the United States enhanced the public's 
recognition of American values and strengthened the understanding of 
some mainstream values. When everybody is hoping for change, maybe 
the lessons learned from the Iraq war will soon be forgotten. It is 
hard to believe that Obama will put forth favorable policies 
concerning Kenya. Even if there is a Chinese-American president, 
that won't change the U.S. policy on China. To be accepted by 
American mainstream society one has to fully accept American values, 
otherwise one will be out. Just as President Bush once said, 'today 
we don't have an American race, but an American faith. '" 
 
b."'Bargain hunting?' Take it slowly" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (11/14): "People are suggesting that Chinese 
companies go abroad to hunt for bargains, or acquire cheap companies 
in times of crisis. This may not be the best option for China and 
Chinese companies. For example, the largest private equity company, 
Carlyle, has been really careful in investments recently and Japan 
has, in the 1980s, paid dearly for their misguided expectations. 
Chinese companies should stand back and observe before they jump 
into the market. Yifu Lin, World Bank Chief Economist and Senior 
Vice President also holds the same view. Risk control is the 
determination factor in overseas investment. They should adjust 
their strategies by paying more attention to emerging economies and 
developing countries as they are relatively less affected by the 
crisis. "
