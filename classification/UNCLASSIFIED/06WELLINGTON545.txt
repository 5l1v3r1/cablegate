SUBJECT: Request for a DVC on Civic Education 
 
 
¶A. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Post requests a DVC with a spokesperson from 
the Center for Civic Education in Calabasas, CA, to discuss aspects 
of civic education, a topic relatively new to this country. 
 
¶B. PREFERRED DATE AND TIME OF PROGRAM, FISCAL YEAR, QUARTER: 
Requested for September 19 (5:00pm Washington DST = 9:00am NZ the 
following day)(3:00pm California = 10am NZ the following day). One 
hour; Fourth quarter; FY2006. 
 
¶C. JUSTIFICATION OF PROGRAM: People in New Zealand's Parliament, 
government, education, and community circles are interested in 
policy development, professional development, and publishing in the 
field of citizenship education. 
 
Select committee inquiries' reports to Parliament show some of the 
local interest, and 2005 citizenship education networking focused on 
how citizenship education could contribute to managing and advancing 
cultural diversity locally. 
 
Interested New Zealanders have an interest in learning how other 
countries address such issues -- and internationally some may be 
interested in knowing more about approaches taken in New Zealand. 
 
A video conference that gives interested New Zealanders a chance to 
connect with a distinguished American specializing in civic 
education would be most useful. 
Post would welcome the opportunity to discuss local approaches to 
citizenship education, particularly: 
- policy formation and professional development; 
- appropriate educational techniques; 
- creation and distribution of relevant resources.
