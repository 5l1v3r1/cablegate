¶1.  Summary:  The June 28, 2003, closure of the street in front of 
the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum for security reasons is once again 
getting press attention.  Some 29 merchants and residents negatively 
affected by the closure of Ali Abdel Latif Street reportedly are 
seeking compensation from the U.S. Government for damages related to 
the street closure.  The group claims that the street closure has 
damaged their business activity and lowered real estate values in 
the area adjacent to the Embassy.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  The Arabic daily "Alwan" reported on December 21 that 29 
merchants and residents of Ali Abdel Latif Street in Khartoum are 
pursuing legal action against the U.S. Embassy, claiming that the 
closure of their street for security reasons in June 2003 has cost 
them revenue and lowered property values.  The group has compiled 
details of the material damages suffered by the businesses, and it 
holds the U.S. Embassy responsible for those damages.  (Note: 
Ordinarily, a lawsuit in Sudan is filed with the courts by a 
professional lawyer.  In this case, however, the Embassy's unhappy 
neighbors have approached the Sudanese Bar Association with their 
complaint.  The Sudanese Bar Association leadership is known to 
harbor anti-American sentiments.  End note.) 
 
¶3.  The plaintiffs reportedly met with the Khartoum State Governor 
and the Director of Khartoum Province to air their grievances.  At 
that meeting, the group demanded compensation.  In addition to 
losing money because of the road closure, the group claims that they 
have suffered "social embarrassment" because they are unable to host 
wedding parties, funeral ceremonies, and other social events. 
 
¶4.  The "Alwan" article comes after a similar article appeared in 
the Arabic daily "Al-Intibaha" on December 18.  "Al-Intibaha," which 
has an anti-U.S. editorial slant, reported that the merchants and 
residents on the street were upset that the closure was negatively 
affecting them.  They called for an immediate reopening of the 
street. 
 
¶5.  Comment:  Earlier this year, the Embassy invoked its right to 
renew the street closure for another three years by Diplomatic Note 
to the MFA (as stipulated in the agreement between the Embassy and 
the State of Khartoum).  To date, the Embassy has received no 
notification of any legal action having been brought against it by 
its neighbors.
