SUBJECT: JORDAN AND IRAQ RENEW AIR TRANSPORT MEMORANDUM 
OF UNDERSTANDING 
 
¶1. (SBU) Jordan Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission (CARC) 
President Suleiman Obeidat confirmed to Embassy DHS Attache that 
CARC and the Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority had renewed a Memo of 
Understanding (MoU) on July 23, expanding air transportation 
cooperation between the two countries, and committing Jordan to a 
"good faith effort" to help Iraq rebuild its aviation 
infrastructure. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The agreement, signed by Obeidat and his Iraqi counterpart, 
Subeih Shibani, is a renewal of a 2004 agreement, with this latest 
edition adding more language concerning specific airports, as well 
as cargo and passenger rules.  Under this MoU the two countries each 
identified two national carriers to operate in each other's 
airspace/countries.  Jordan has selected Royal Jordanian Airlines 
(RJ) and the Royal Falcon Company as its national 
carriers, although RJ has the contracts granting broader access to 
the Iraq airports.  Royal Falcon can currently operate only in Mosul 
and Najaf.  (NOTE: Royal Falcon owns and operates only one Boeing 
737-400 and has one other, a Boeing 767, on a "dry" lease 
arrangement.  END NOTE).  Iraq named Iraqi Airways and "any other 
carrier" which it can name at a later date. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Obeidat specifically denied press reports that the aviation 
memo would "deregulate issuing visas for Iraqi travelers," noting 
that he had no authority to do any such thing, and had no idea where 
that item came from.  He mentioned, however, that the CARC had 
received complaints regarding Jordanian officials harassing Iraqis 
who arrive via Iraqi Airways (but not those arriving via RJ), and 
said CARC was investigating those. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The agreement further stipulates the airports selected for 
inclusion under this arrangement, with Jordan naming Queen Alia 
International Airport in Amman and King Hussein Airport in Aqaba, 
and Iraq identifying Baghdad, Basra, Suleimaniyeh, Irbil, Mosul, and 
Najaf.  (Note: Amman Marka Airport was considered primarily a 
military airfield for the purposes of this MoU and therefore was not 
included in this agreement.  End Note.)  Press reports described 
specific agreements to operate passenger and cargo flights by each 
carrier -- without specifying type of aircraft or capacity -- at a 
weekly rate of seven flights between Amman and Baghdad; four weekly 
passenger and two cargo flights between Amman and Basra; four weekly 
passenger flights between Amman and Suleimaniyeh; eight passenger 
flights between Amman and Irbil; two passenger and two freight 
flights between Amman and Mosul; and three passenger flights between 
Amman and Najaf.  Iraq's Shibanai was quoted as saying the signing 
reflected a common interest in upgrading aviation cooperation 
between Iraq and Jordan.  Obeidat reportedly said the agreement was 
in line with the CARC's strategy to promote cooperation with Arab 
countries and facilitate civil aviation and air transport.
