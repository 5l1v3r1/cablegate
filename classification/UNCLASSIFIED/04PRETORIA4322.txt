MEDICAL USE 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary: De Beers, the world's largest producer of 
diamonds, has developed a fast x-ray scanner for diamond 
detection and analysis that also has useful application in 
the medical field.  The Digital X-ray machine, called the 
Statscan, costs about $500,000 and can perform a full-body x- 
ray in about 13 seconds -- compared to 45 minutes for a 
series of conventional x-rays.  Moreover, the Statscan 
delivers a 75% less x-ray dosage than conventional x-ray 
machines.  Quick scanning and low dosage help to allay 
patient fears and makes x-raying safer.  It is particularly 
useful in trauma situations.  End Summary 
 
¶2.  (U) De Beers' developed the original version of the 
Statscan to detect stolen diamonds hidden on mineworkers and 
other employees.  De Beers needed a machine that was fast 
and safe for everyday use and came up with the Statscan. 
Soon it was apparent that the Statscan also had applications 
in the medical field.  The Industrial Development 
Corporation (the IDC, a government financing agency) agreed 
to co-fund development of the first medical version. 
Together, DeBeers and the IDC created Lodox Systems to 
develop and market the Statscan. 
 
¶3.  (U) The first Statscan systems were installed in South 
Africa at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town and the 
Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg.  Subsequently, one of the 
world's busiest trauma centers, the R. Adams Cowley Shock 
Trauma Center in Baltimore, installed a system.  Lodox has 
now established a full subsidiary in the United States and 
has sold seven systems to new prototype emergency rooms 
designed after the September 11th terrorist attacks.
