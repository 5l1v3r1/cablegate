REFTEL: USDOC 04978 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 
Technoservicepribor, Moscow, Russia. The company is 
listed on BIS license application D358560 as the 
ultimate consignee of vector network analyzer. These 
items are controlled for national security reasons 
under ECCN 3A002. The licensee is Anritsu Company, 490 
Jarvis Drive, Morgan Hill, CA 95037. 
 
¶3. On September 19, 2006 Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of 
Technoservicepribor (TSP), Sumskoy proezd, 21/3, 
Moscow and met with Andrey Kolesnikov, Commercial 
Director. 
 
¶4. TSP is a technical support and repair service 
focusing on the medical and communications industries. 
The company specializes in maintenance and repair of 
foreign made high technology equipment used in 
telecommunications and medical applications.  The 
company is a spin off of the Interanalyt Company, a 
distributor of high technology products for industry. 
NOTE: Interanalyt was the subject of an NLR PSV 
conducted on April 6, 2005 and reported in 2005 MOSCOW 
¶04004.  TSP has been a separate entity since March 
¶2006.  The company employs 7 at the Sumskoy poyezd 
location, and has no other offices.  Mr. Kolesnikov 
has a three-year contract to run the organization on 
the behalf of the owner.  The company is privately 
held. 
 
¶5. TSP plans on using the analyzer in reftel for 
service and maintenance of medical and communications 
devices.  TSP is currently bidding on several tenders 
to provide diagnostic and maintenance services for 
medical facilities in the Moscow area.  The tender, 
offered by Medtechnica, a state unitary organization 
responsible for equipping medical clinics in Moscow, 
would be to calibrate and maintain medical diagnostic 
equipment such as Magnetic Resonance Imagers (MRI) and 
the like.  TSP is also exploring the opportunity to 
work with Shimazdzu Europe, GmbH to be an authorized 
service center for their organization in Russia. In 
addition, TSP hopes to offer its services to 
telecommunications operators in the regions outside of 
Moscow. TSP will test and service wireline systems as 
they are upgraded to provide broadband services such 
as cable television, high-speed Internet access and 
other services. 
 
¶6. The device will be stored in a cabinet in a secured 
laboratory.  The room has barred windows, and an 
electronic security system.  The perimeter of the 
building is patrolled by security at all times. TSP 
has no military contracts, and is aware of the end use 
conditions of the license.  Only one or two 
specialists will utilize the equipment. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends 
Technoservicepribor, Moscow, Russia, as reliable 
recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is 
requested that post be notified of final disposition 
of the application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
