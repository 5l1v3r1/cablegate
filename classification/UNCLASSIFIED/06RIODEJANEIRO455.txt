Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. Ambassador Sobel, accompanied by the CG, Principal Commercial 
Officer, and Conoff met on August 21, with the President and senior 
officials of the Brazilian National Economic and Social Development 
Bank (BNDES), a federal agency which is the chief source of 
long-term funding for projects to promote Brazilian development. 
Discussion centered on BNDES' role in shaping Brazilian economic 
development, job creation, the promotion of innovation and 
productivity through investment, and areas where coincident U.S. and 
Brazilian interests could increase trade and investment.  The BNDES 
leadership identified four priorities areas for further exchange and 
action: exchanging ideas and contacts for technological innovation, 
social investment opportunities, Small Business Administration 
contact and program information, and venture capital possibilities. 
 
 
¶2. Afterwards, Ambassador Sobel attended a luncheon hosted by the 
Board of Directors of the Federation of Industries of Rio de Janeiro 
(FIRJAN), the principal trade association and lobby for the state's 
industrial companies and a prominent sounding board on social and 
economic growth issues affecting the state of Rio de Janeiro. 
There, the discussion covered a range of topics, including progress 
in the US-Brazil trading relationship, and ways to further contacts 
among institutions and experts involved in areas of mutual interest. 
 End Summary. 
 
BNDES 
----- 
 
¶3. BNDES President Demian Fiocca told the Ambassador during their 
August 21 meeting that BNDES made a priority of  promoting trade, 
particularly in new areas which are strategically important but not 
yet economically viable, such as biofuels and renewable energy. 
Ambassador Sobel commented on the crucial role small and 
medium-sized businesses (SMEs) play in job creation, citing 
cooperative activities initiated by the USG's Small Business 
Administration in Mexico.  Fiocca described the mechanism through 
which BNDES provides incentives to retail banks, its primary 
customers, to support SMEs, assigning lending targets (a percentage 
of business) the banks must reach to qualify for higher credit 
limits. 
 
Investment Funds to Support Innovation 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Responding to Ambassador Sobel's question on BNDES programs to 
promote innovation and productivity, Dr. Marcos Pinto, the Chief of 
Staff for Public Private Partnerships, and Dr. Francesco Sirangelo, 
Senior Advisor to Mr. Fiocca, described the BNDES investment funds 
which support innovative private sector companies.  At present, 
BNDES has two venture capital funds and four private equity funds; 
it is planning to create a seed money fund as well.  Dr. Pinto noted 
that the funds are under private sector management, and that some of 
the funds included investment by private sector entities as well as 
by BNDES.  All companies in Brazil are eligible for these funds - 
Brazilian and non-Brazilian (including U.S. companies). 
 
PPPs and Social Inclusion - Limited Progress 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. In a discussion of the evolution of public-private partnerships 
(PPPs), Fiocca and Pinto described delays arising from Brazil's 
public financing law, noting that BNDES was trying to speed up 
progress, at least at the federal level.  Fiocca expressed hope that 
the federal government would make reforming the process a priority 
after the October elections. 
 
¶6. In response to the Ambassador's query, Fiocca said that BNDES 
offered specific low interest loans (prime rate plus zero percent) 
to the companies it finances.  These loans are designed specifically 
for social projects to help companies' employees and their families, 
or for the local community. 
 
 
BNDES' Role in Public Policy and Biofuels Industry 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
RIO DE JAN 00000455  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶7. Fiocca also explained BNDES' role in public policy.  Citing 
ethanol as an example, he outlined that, to develop this industry 
further, his Director of Planning is studying industry 
recommendations and is developing proposals to prepare Brazil to 
enter the world market, ensure the stability of supply, and develop 
infrastructure with technological input and investments from other 
countries.  With regard the energy sector as a whole, BNDES has 
increased financing for ethanol production and cogeneration for 
electricity in the last few years, and is investing in refineries. 
In addition, BNDES is financing a recently approved biodiesel 
development plan. 
 
Opportunities and Areas for Further Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶8. Ambassador Sobel concluded the discussions by noting the critical 
need to address "pocketbook issues" between the U.S. and Brazil, 
stressing that increased trade and investment would form the basis 
of deeper cooperation and stronger relations.  He outlined several 
opportunities for sharing expertise and furthering mutual interests: 
biofuels, working with the IFC, securitization of mortgages through 
OPIC, supporting and promoting social development working through 
the Ministry of Education and the U.S. Competitiveness Council to 
bring together corporations and universities to stimulate innovation 
and entrepreneurship,  as well as encouraging both public and 
private organizations to come to Brazil to explore future exchanges. 
 
 
¶9. The meeting concluded with the BNDES leadership identifying what 
they viewed as four areas for further discussion and action between 
the U.S. and Brazil: innovation strategy, social investment 
opportunities, SME financing, and venture capital funds. 
 
Federation of Industries of Rio de Janeiro (FIRJAN) 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶10. The Ambassador then attended a luncheon hosted by the Board of 
the Federation of Industries of Rio de Janeiro (FIRJAN).  The 
Ambassador and Carlos Mariani Bittencourt (Chairman of the Board of 
PIN Petroquimica SA, also a member of the BNDES Board) opened the 
discussion by recalling the recent positive changes in the 
U.S.-Brazil trade and investment climates. For example, Brazil's 
investments in the United States are increasing - Fundacao Odebrecht 
is building the new airport in Miami, and Petrobras recently 
invested in oil blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pasadena 
Refinery in Houston.  In addition, Brazil now ranks third among 
countries with companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 
¶11. In discussing ways to enhance U.S.-Brazil trade and investment, 
Ambassador Sobel encouraged the FIRJAN members to press the GOB, 
through their companies, to negotiate a tax treaty between the U.S. 
and Brazil and eliminate the current double-taxation both Brazilian 
and U.S. companies suffer by doing business in both countries.  The 
Ambassador and the FIRJAN board agreed to pursue various ways for 
Brazilian and American institutions to work together, including 
working through BNDES, developing a biofuels experts group, 
increasing private company/ university collaboration, and creating a 
private sector leaders group. 
 
¶12. This cable was cleared by Ambassador Sobel and Embassy 
Brasilia.
