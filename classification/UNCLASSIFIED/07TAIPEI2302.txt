SUBJECT: TYPHOON KROSA CAUSES WIDESPREAD DAMAGE TO TAIWAN 
 
 ¶1.  Summary. Typhoon Krosa, which hit Taiwan October 6-7, 
was the strongest typhoon to strike Taiwan in years.  It 
caused significant damage, yet Taiwan is quickly getting back 
to normal. No Amcits deaths or injuries were reported. 
 
¶2.  Typhoon Krosa, packing winds from 162 km/hr to 200 km/hr 
and heavy rainfall, hit Taiwan October 6-7 causing widespread 
damage to crops, infrastructure and leaving at least 8 dead, 
5 missing and 56 injured.  The typhoon left close to 2.2 
million households without electricity throughout Taiwan, the 
highest level in 10 years.  Yet as of October 9, only 32 
households remained without electricity and water and phone 
services were quickly restored. 
 
¶3.  During the typhoon, six reservoirs close to capacity due 
to the heavy rainfall had to release water. 
More than a meter of rain fell in several locations around 
the island.  Rainfall levels reached 1,112 mm in Chiayi, with 
Hsinchu in the north receiving 1,013 mm and Ilan's 
Taipingshan 1,072mm.  Flooding was reported in Tainan and the 
Taipei suburb of Peitou.  Aside from the flooding, landslides 
contributed to closed roads and collapsed houses.   Repair 
crews are working on 22 roads nationwide, trying to repair 48 
spots where roads have been blocked either by falling rocks 
or washed away by flooding.  The Suhua highway, the main east 
coast transportation artery linking Suao and Hualien was 
blocked by rockfalls. 
 
¶4.  Taiwan's Council of Agriculture estimated damage to crops 
and agricultural equipment at NT$ 2.7 billion ($81 million 
USD) over an area of 50,000 hectares, ranking Krosa as one of 
the top ten natural disasters in terms of damage caused. 
Banana, rice, persimmon, papaya and grapes are some of the 
most heavily hurt plantations in the central and eastern 
areas of Taiwan.  Damage to fisheries is estimated at NT$150 
million ($4.5 million USD).  This crop damage is already 
being felt in the local markets by the higher prices for 
produce and fruit.  Farmers who have suffered losses due to 
the typhoon can apply for a cash relief fund/low interest 
loans from the authorities to speed their recovery. 
 
¶5.  No typhoon-related injuries or deaths of Amcits were 
reported, nor have any Amcits contacted AIT seeking 
assistance in the typhoon's aftermath.  AIT has not received 
any requests for assistance from Taiwan authorities nor does 
AIT anticipate any requests in the coming days.
