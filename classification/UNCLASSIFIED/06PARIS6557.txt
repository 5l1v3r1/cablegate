¶1.  Per reftel, Post Blue Lantern Action Officer contacted 
the French company ACAL's Product Line Manager Philippe 
Bluteau and the end-user company SAGEM Defense and Security 
Transmission Drone (TACTDRONE) Activity Chief Pascal Paqueron. 
 
¶2.  ACAL's Bluteau confirmed that ACAL ordered SIRENZA items 
referenced SVCO-5176, 5177, 5178, and 5179 and that the order 
corresponds exactly with an order placed by SAGEM S&D, which 
they confirm is the final end user.  Bluteau said that ACAL 
is generally familiar with the USML regulations as they 
affect their obligations when placing an order with Sirenza. 
Further, ACAL is SIRENZA's representative in France. 
 
¶3.  Concerning reftel's query regarding invoice item number 
five, valued at USD 3000, Bluteau explained that it is not 
for a physical commodity but for development costs (NRE- 
Non-Recurring Engineering Costs) required to study the 
specific products and their ability to satisfy SAGEM's 
technical requirements, e.g., frequency band and output 
level. 
¶4.  SAGEM's Paqueron told us that the items ordered are for 
development of the "new generation of systems for 
transmitting data to and from unmanned aviation vehicles 
(UAV)."  According to Paqueron, SAGEM ordered just a few 
items of each component to assemble prototypes for testing 
purposes and SAGEM is the final end user for this specific 
order.  According to SAGEM, "If the performance sought is 
achieved, it is likely that SAGEM will place other orders for 
production to cover the needs of clients such as the French 
Defense Ministry." 
 
¶5.  Paqueron said that he had an established relationship 
with ACAL, which is a regular supplier of SAGEM.  He 
considers the firm a responsible importer of U.S. Munitions 
list commodities.  He confirmed the order of the UAV 
communications equipment from ACAL.
