SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND POSITION UNCHANGED ON CUBA'S UN 
RESOLUTION AGAINST THE EMBARGO 
 
REF: STATE 215870 
 
¶1. Post delivered reftel demarche to Mike Shaw, Americas 
Division, New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(MFAT.)  Shaw offered to circulate the information to 
relevant MFAT personnel, but stated that the GoNZ was 
unlikely to change its vote, or to abstain.  Poloff urged 
Shaw to maintain a dialogue on the issue, and to seriously 
consider the points provided. 
 
¶2. In a separate discussion, Roy Ferguson, Director, Americas 
Division (MFAT,) told PolCouns that, while New Zealand 
officials remain concerned over the human rights situation in 
Cuba, as a matter of general policy the GoNZ opposes the use 
of economic sanctions to exert political pressure on other 
countries.  Ferguson's statements reinforce the GoNZ's 
likelihood to vote yes on the Cuba resolution.
