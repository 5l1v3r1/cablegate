   ENDED 
   PRESIDENTIAL POLL IN ZIMBABWE IS FODDER FOR 
   EDITORIALS PUBLISHED IN THE MARCH 14 EDITIONS OF 
   THE LEADING NEWSPAPERS IN THE COUNTRY.  THE 
   EDITORIALS WERE UNANIMOUS IN CALLING ON PRESIDENT 
   ROBERT MUGABE TO ADDRESS THE PRIMARY CHALLENGES 
   FACING THE COUNTRY.  EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   UNDER HEADLINE "BEYOND THE VOTE" THE INDEPENDENT 
   WEEKLY "THE FINANCIAL GAZETTE" (03/14) COMMENTS: 
 
   "THAT ZIMBABWE'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WOULD NOT BE 
   FREE AND FAIR WAS NOT IN DOUBT FROM THE VERY START. 
   . .  THE UNEVEN PLAYING FIELD, MARKED BY THE 
   GOVERNMENT'S ABUSE OF THE STATE MEDIA, ITS USE OF 
   HASTILY CRAFTED UNDEMOCRATIC LAWS WHICH WERE 
   CHANGED VIRTUALLY EVERY HOUR TO SUIT ONE CANDIDATE, 
   ITS REFUSAL TO ACCEPT INDEPENDENT MONITORS AND 
   OBSERVERS AND ITS DECISION TO CUT POLLING STATIONS 
   IN URBAN AREAS, WAS BOUND TO PRODUCE A PRE- 
   DETERMINED RESULT. . .  ZIMBABWEANS WHO VOTED IN 
   THEIR MILLIONS TO TRY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THEIR 
   HARROWING LIVES AND TO RESCUE THEIR COUNTRY FROM 
   ITS RAPID DESCENT INTO THE ABYSS WERE BOUND TO BE 
   DISAPPOINTED AND ANGERED, BUT THAT IS NOW WATER 
   UNDER THE BRIDGE.  THEY WILL FIGHT ANOTHER DAY. 
   UNFORTUNATELY FOR ZIMBABWEANS, THE POLL RESULT 
   SPELLS MUCH MORE PAIN AND SUFFERING BECAUSE, FROM 
   NOW ON, THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL 
   TREAT THIS COUNTRY AS A PARIAH WHICH IT IS. . . 
   FOR PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE AND HIS BACKERS, THIS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  00672  01 OF 03  141108Z 
   ELECTION WILL BE INTERPRETED AS A FINAL AND HEROIC 
   VINDICATION OF HIS BLACK NATIONALIST CREDENTIALS 
   AND HARD-LINE STANCE ON THE UNRESOLVED LAND 
   QUESTION WHICH HE SAYS HE MUST PUT TO REST ONCE AND 
   FOR ALL.  MANY IN THE LAND AND BEYOND WILL BE 
   SEARCHING FOR CLUES TO SEE IF, IN HIS LAST 
   PRESIDENCY IF IT STANDS, HE WILL REDEEM HIMSELF AND 
   PULL HIS TROUBLED COUNTRY BACK FROM THE BRINK. 
 
   ". . .MUGABE MUST NOW BEGIN TO CHART A NEW AND 
   DIFFERENT VISION FOR ZIMBABWE COMPARED TO THE ONE 
   HE RAMMED THROUGH THE NATION FOR TWO DECADES, NO 
   MATTER HOW LATE.  HE MUST WORK ASSIDUOUSLY TO HEAL 
   A NATION DEEPLY FRACTURED BY BLOODY CONFLICT, 
   UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC RUIN AND MASS HUNGER IN ONE 
   OF AFRICA'S RICHEST COUNTRIES.  HE MUST TAKE A LONG 
   PAUSE OVER HIS SEIZURE OF PRIVATE COMMERCIAL FARMS 
   AND INSTEAD LAUNCH TRANSPARENT, LEGAL AND FAIR LAND 
   REFORMS WHICH GUARANTEE FOOD SECURITY FOR ALL IN 
   THE LAND. . .HE MUST RE-LOOK THE MANY HURRIED LAWS 
   WHICH HE AUTHORIZED JUST BEFORE THE BALLOT. . 
   .ABOVE ALL, HE MUST MOVE SWIFTLY AND DECISIVELY TO 
   RESTORE LAW AND ORDER AND PUNISH WITHOUT 
   COMPUNCTION ALL HIS FOLLOWERS WHO BECAME A LAW UNTO 
   THEMSELVES DURING AND BEFORE THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN. 
   . .  HE MAY ALSO WANT TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER. . 
   .FORMING A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY TO STAVE 
   OFF MORE BUT NEEDLESS BLOODSHED, PARTICULARLY GIVEN 
   THE HUGE DISSENTING VOTE RECORDED. . .  WHETHER 
   ZIMBABWEANS AND THE WORLD EVENTUALLY ACCEPT 
   MUGABE'S DEEPLY FLAWED VICTORY WILL LARGELY DEPEND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  00672  01 OF 03  141108Z 
   UPON HOW HE TACKLES THESE AND MANY OTHER 
   OUTSTANDING ISSUES WHICH CRY OUT FOR MORE THAN 
   URGENT ATTENTION.  THE IMMEDIATE OUTLOOK FOR HIS 
   DAUNTING TASK IS VERY GRIM. . .  ONE ONLY HOPES 
   THAT MUGABE WILL READ THE EXPLOSIVE MOOD WITHIN AND 
   OUTSIDE ZIMBABWE CORRECTLY AND ACT WISELY NOT JUST 
   FOR HIS SAKE BUT FOR ZIMBABWE. 
 
¶3.   UNDER HEADLINE "NATION BUILDING IS THE WORK OF 
   ALL," THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD" 
   (03/14) COMMENTS: 
 
   "NOW THAT THE ISSUE OF THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP OF 
   THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SETTLED FOLLOWING YESTERDAY'S 
   DECLARATION OF MUGABE AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
   REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE, AFTER THREE DAYS OF POLLING, 
   IT IS TIME NOW FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO WORK 
   WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN NATION BUILDING.  THERE IS 
   NO DENYING THE FACT THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR, LIKE 
   ANY OTHER ORDINARY ZIMBABWEANS, HAD TAKEN POLITICAL 
   POSITIONS.  BUSINESS HAD ALMOST GROUND TO A HALT AS

   NOW SHIFT TOWARDS SOLVING THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS 
   AFFLICTING THE COUNTRY. . .  WITH THE ELECTORATE 
   MANDATING MUGABE TO LEAD THE COUNTRY FOR THE NEXT 
   SIX YEARS, POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS SHOULD NOW BE PUT 
   ASIDE AS THE GOVERNMENT, THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND 
   ORDINARY CITIZENS PUT HEADS TOGETHER IN SEEKING 
   SOLUTIONS TO THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC WOES. . .  THE 
   RE-ELECTION OF PRESIDENT MUGABE SHOULD NOW SEE 
   BUSINESS PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THEIR SHELLS TO TAKE 
   FIRM POSITIONS IN NATION BUILDING.  NOW IS THE TIME 
   TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE ENDEAVOR TO PROP UP THE 
   ECONOMY AND THIS REQUIRES THE INVOLVEMENT OF ALL 
   CITIZENS REGARDLESS OF POLITICAL AFFILIATION. . . 
   WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL LISTEN TO 
   THE CONCERNS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE PEOPLE 
   AND MOVE SWIFTLY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS.  WE ARE 
   QUITE SURE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT BE FOUND WANTING

   GOVERNMENT WORK TOGETHER IN MAPPING OUT SURVIVAL 
   STRATEGIES, WE WILL NOT GO WRONG. . . ."

   SPECIAL EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY 
   "THE HERALD" DEDICATED ITS MARCH 13 FRONT PAGE 
   EDITORIAL TO ENCOURAGING ZIMBABWEANS TO TURN THEIR 
   "SWORDS INTO PLOUGHSHARES" AND "RALLY BEHIND" 
   PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE IN REBUILDING THE NATION 
   AFTER A HOTLY-CONTESTED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

   "THE MOST BITTERLY FOUGHT ELECTION SINCE 
   INDEPENDENCE IS OVER.  PRESIDENT MUGABE HAS WON A 
   NEW MANDATE.  HIS WIN WAS COMFORTABLE AND DECISIVE. 
   HOWEVER, AS HE PREPARES FOR A NEW SIX-YEAR TERM OF 
   OFFICE, HE DOES SO AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF A HIGHLY 
   POLARIZED NATION.  FOR TWO YEARS ZIMBABWE HAS BEEN 
   IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN THAT 
   RESEMBLED A BATTLEFIELD OR A CIVIL CONFLICT. 
   HAVING OVERCOME THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF HIS 
   POLITICAL CAREER, THE PRESIDENT FACES THE DAUNTING 
   TASK OF BRINGING TOGETHER A DIVIDED NATION THAT HAS 
   FOR YEARS EXISTED UNDER A FACADE OF RACIAL HARMONY 
   AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY WHILE HIDING THE DEEP 
   DIVISIONS BETWEEN WHITE AND BLACK COUNTRYMEN AND 
   THE GROWING POVERTY AMONG ITS PEASANTRY. . .  THE 
   CHALLENGE IS BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN THE RICH 
   COMMERCIAL FARMERS. . .AND THE POOR MAJORITY WHO 
   HAVE WAITED FOR OVER 20 YEARS TO RECLAIM THE 
   COUNTRY TO MOVE FORWARD.  FOR AS LONG AS THE MDC 
   LEADER, MORGAN TSVANGIRAI, CONTINUES TO ASSUME THE 
   POSTURE OF A GUERILLA LEADER AND NOT AN OPPOSITION 
   LEADER, THE OUTSIDE FORCES THAT HAVE SUBJECTED THIS 
   COUNTRY TO THE MOST TORRID TIMES WILL HAVE AN 
   EXCUSE TO PERPETUATE THEIR NEFARIOUS ACTIVITIES. 
   THE FIGHTING IS OVER AND IT IS TIME TO REBUILD THE 
   COUNTRY LOOKING AT THE REALITIES THAT CONFRONT THIS 
   NATION.  WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BURY OUR HEADS IN THE 
   SAND AND PRETEND THAT THERE ARE NO FUNDAMENTAL 
   ISSUES THAT ARE CRYING OUT TO BE REDRESSED.

   "THE QUESTION OF LAND WAS THE MAJOR CAMPAIGN ISSUE 
   IN THIS ELECTION, WHICH WAS AFFIRMED BY THE 
   MAJORITY OF THE ELECTORATE WHO VOTED FOR PRESIDENT 
   MUGABE. . .  IT IS NOW INCUMBENT UPON ALL THE 
   PLAYERS TO ACCEPT THIS REALITY. . .  THE REALITY IS 
   THAT LAND REFORM CAN NOT BE REVERSED. . .  THE 
   FOLLOWING FEW DAYS WILL BE TELLING IN TERMS OF THE 
   DIRECTION THE COUNTRY WILL BE TAKING.  THE CRUCIAL 
   POINT, HOWEVER, IS THAT IT IS NO LONGER NECESSARY 
   FOR CITIZEN TO BE FIGHTING CITIZEN.  LET US ALL 
   RALLY BEHIND THE PRESIDENT AND TURN OUR SWORDS INTO 
   PLOUGHSHARES.  THE VIOLENCE THAT MARRED THE 
   POLITICAL PROCESS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WAS 
   WRONG. . .  WE NEED TO LEARN AS A COUNTRY TO 
   OPERATE A NORMAL TWO-PARTY SYSTEM.  THIS DOES 
   REQUIRE A GENERAL ACCEPTANCE OF DEMOCRATIC RULES. 
   THE TWO MOST VITAL ARE THAT LOSERS SHOULD ACCEPT 
   THAT THERE IS A PERMANENT OPPOSITION GENERATING NEW 
   IDEAS AND WAITING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE A 
   MISTAKE.  IN OTHER WORDS, A MAJORITY PARTY AND AN 
   OPPOSITION PARTY SHOULD NOT SEE EACH OTHER AS
