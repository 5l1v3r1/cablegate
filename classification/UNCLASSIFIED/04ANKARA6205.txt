Deputy PolMilCouns delivered USG response to the Turkish Air 
Force (TUAF) questionnaire on satellite co-development and 
commercialization (ref A) to TUAF Aerospace Division Chief 
Colonel Varol Dingersu and TUAF Satellite System Design 
Officer Captain Ergun Kocabicak on November 2.  Dingersu and 
Kocabicak welcomed the USG response and confirmed that our 
answers to the specific questions provided the depth of 
response desired.  TUAF had submitted the questionnaire only 
to get a general sense of the respondent countries' interest 
in exploring the specific types of cooperation raised and did 
not expect detailed answers.  Calling the USG response the 
most important, Dingersu said that TUAF had waited for our 
input before proceeding with the evaluation of all six 
responses.  He expected TUAF to complete its review and 
contact respondent countries during the first quarter of 
¶2005.
