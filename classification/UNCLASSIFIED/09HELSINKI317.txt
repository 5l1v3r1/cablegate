REF: STATE 83550 
 
(U) On August 18, PolOff delivered reftel message with German 
Parfenov from the Russian Embassy to Outi Holopainen, 
Director, Finnish MFA Unit for Arms Control, Disarmament and 
Non-proliferation.  Holopainen noted that the UNODC observer 
addition is a plus for synergy and coordination.  She said 
that she felt Government of Finland (GoF) reaped benefits 
from GICNT membership since the EU has taken up work on 
nuclear terrorism and weapons of mass destruction and GoF 
ministries (such as transportation) have embraced related 
detection work and raised domestic awareness.
