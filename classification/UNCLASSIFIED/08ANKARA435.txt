Troop Withdrawal Controversy between the Military and the 
Opposition 
Sabah, Milliyet, Yeni Safak, Zaman, Cumhuriyet, Radikal, Vatan and 
others:   During a party meeting yesterday, opposition CHP leader 
Deniz Baykal criticized the AKP government for bowing to US pressure 
to withdraw from Iraq.  Baykal stressed, "I am talking on behalf of 
the Turkish nation as the head of the main opposition party and I 
signed the motion that tasked the Turkish military with this 
operation." 
 
MHP leader Devlet Bahceli addressed his party group and said the 
operations in northern Iraq were carried out within limits 
determined by the US.  Bahceli added "the military's sudden 
withdrawal caused surprise and disappointment.  This shows there is 
a serious communication problem between state institutions.  The 
Turkish public learned of the troop withdrawal from the spokesman of 
the northern Iraqi Administration."  Bahceli also criticized the 
Turkish General Staff (TGS) for using terms such as "command center" 
and "logistical installations" in its statements about the PKK, as 
if the terrorist organization were a regular army.  Bahceli said 
that such references may cause the terrorist organization to gain 
undeserved prestige.   Mainstream Vatan, Sabah and Islamist-oriented 
Zaman say that Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan warned both opposition 
parties not to drag the military into political debates.  Sabah 
reminds that earlier, during the presidential elections, PM Erdogan 
was also the target of a harsh military statement. 
 
In reaction to the opposition parties' criticism, the TGS issued a 
harsh response on its website.  "Such unfair and worthless attacks 
do more harm to the military than treachery." The statement noted 
that "the Turkish Military never wanted to enter the political 
debate, but for the first time in the 24-year long fight against 
terrorism," the military is the subject of attacks. 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak refers to TGS statement as the 
"e-memorandum to the opposition." 
 
Editorial Opinion on Cross Border Operation Debate 
 
"The US and Yet Another Scandal" 
Mustafa Mutlu is a popular columnist on domestic issues and he 
writes in mainstream Vatan (3/5): 
"Turkey is still debating whether the US influenced Turkey's 
decision to end its cross border operation.  Even if we assume that 
such influence does not exist, it is still very difficult to explain 
something else.  During a conference at Columbia University, Turkish 
participants presented the turban-related Turkish constitutional 
changes to American participants.  Thus, Americans learned the 
details of the new constitutional draft before the Turkish public. 
Moreover, this conference was sponsored and organized by a group 
affiliated with the religious sect leader Fethullah Gulen.  Though 
these may be two separate events, they are equally damaging.  But 
wait, there's more.  The Columbia University conference participants 
from Turkey, including an AKP parliamentarian who sits on the party 
board, debated the headscarf issue in front of Americans; the AKP 
deputy even complained about Turkey to the Americans.  When it comes 
to international relations, it really matters how you see yourself 
and your country.  Others may treat you like you belong to a state 
in a colony, but national pride can overcome this.  The Turkish 
army, at least, stood up and said openly that the decision to 
withdraw was entirely the army's prerogative.  I really wonder, how 
will those who debated the Turkish constitution in the US during an 
event sponsored by Fethullah Gulen be able to justify their 
action?" 
 
"The Military Shadow Over the Debate" 
Mehmet Y. Yilmaz is a senior columnist and one of the top executives 
of the Hurriyet board.  He writes in mainstream Hurriyet (3/5): 
"The CBO withdrawal debate is continuing on an absurd level.  The 
 
ANKARA 00000435  002 OF 003 
 
 
debate has finally become a platform for political rhetoric and this 
debate is not moving us forward.  Instead, it is causing us to run 
in circles.  The Turkish army's involvement in this debate is 
difficult to understand.  The Turkish army initiated a military 
operation based on a mandate passed by the parliament.   In other 
words, the political consequences of the cross border operation are 
a concern of the government, not the military.  The government 
should face this political criticism, not the military.  Currently, 
the AKP government is hiding behind the military.  This is a 
surprising development considering this government used to be very 
uncomfortable with the military's influence.  This is a very funny 
country that we live in indeed." 
 
Diplomacy Traffic Increases Following the Cross Border Operation. 
All news outlets report Iraqi President Jalal Talabani will visit 
Ankara in a "working visit" on Friday.  Mainstream Sabah points out 
that "no welcoming ceremony will be held in honor of Talabani in 
Ankara."  Mainstream Vatan also notes "President Gul will not host a 
banquet in honor of Talabani."  Mainstream Milliyet writes "in the 
bilateral discussions, Turkey plans to ask the Iraqi government and 
the regional administration of northern Iraq to actively support 
efforts against the PKK."  Nationalist-oriented Cumhuriyet predicts, 
"Talabani may come to Turkey while Ahmedinejad visits Turkey so the 
three leaders can hold a three-party summit on the fight against 
terror."  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak cites CNN Turk in saying that 
US Vice-President Dick Cheney will come to Turkey after March 17 to 
discuss Iraq and the fight against the PKK. 
 
Israel Says, "Hamas Is No Different from the PKK." 
Liberal Radikal reports in "According to Israel, There Is No 
Difference between Hamas and the PKK," that Israeli Ambassador Gabby 
Levy held a press conference "to compare Turkish cross-border 
operations against the PKK to Israeli operations in Hamas-controlled 
areas of Gaza."  Nationalist-oriented Cumhuriyet writes in "Israel 
Sends a Message to Erdogan: There Is No Difference between Hamas and 
the PKK," that Levy called Erdogan's opposition to Israeli 
operations "of concern" and noted "of the 100 people who were killed 
in Gaza, 90 were militants."   Mainstream Sabah notes Levy's 
response to Erdogan's claims of genocide in Gaza, "Israeli 
Ambassador Gabby Levy noted Israeli operations in Gaza cannot be 
described as genocide in the same way that that it is not possible 
to describe the Armenian events of 1915 as genocide." 
Islamist-oriented Zaman reports in "The Israeli Ambassador Draws a 
Parallel between the Armenian Events of 1915 and Gaza," that "Levy 
emphasized Israel's right to defend itself against a terrorist 
organization," and noted "whether in Gaza or in northern Iraq, we 
believe we must fight against terror."
