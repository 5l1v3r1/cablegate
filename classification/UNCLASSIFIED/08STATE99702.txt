SUBJECT: OSCE PERMANENT COUNCIL: STATEMENT ON EU OBSERVERS 
TO GEORGIA 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
 
The United States welcomes the September 15 European Union 
decision to send an independent civilian observer mission to 
Georgia.  We commend EU Member States, strong commitment to 
deploying at least 200 observers by October 1. 
 
We believe these observers, together with the OSCE military 
monitoring officers, will constitute the international 
mechanism of the six-point Ceasefire Agreement. 
 
The United States notes Russia,s recent withdrawal of forces 
from five observation posts along the Poti-Senaki line, but 
we remain concerned by Georgian Government reports that an 
estimated 1,200 Russian soldiers remain at 19 checkpoints 
outside both Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  We and our European 
partners will watch carefully to see if these soldiers are 
withdrawn within 10 days of the deployment of international 
mechanisms ) including the EU observers ) in accordance 
with the September 8 agreement between French President 
Sarkozy and Russian President Medvedev. 
 
Mr. Chairman, the United States once more calls on Russia to 
implement in their entirety the commitments made in the 
Ceasefire Agreement and reflected in its clarifying 
documents.  We remind Russia of its obligation to withdraw 
its forces to their pre-conflict positions, as required in 
the six-point Ceasefire Agreement. 
 
In light of continuing reports of the destruction of ethnic 
Georgian villages in areas controlled by Russian forces and 
the forced displacement of ethnic Georgians, we also remind 
Russia that its forces are responsible for taking steps to 
maintain order in the areas of Georgia they occupy and not 
blocking the return and safe livelihood of local residents. 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, we demand that Russia not block the free flow 
of humanitarian assistance to all areas of Georgia as 
stipulated in point three of the six-point ceasefire 
agreement.  We remind Russia that turning back shipments of 
humanitarian assistance and assessment teams trying to reach 
villages in South Ossetia contravenes the agreement and 
raises questions about Russia upholding its obligations under 
international law as well. 
 
Finally, we urge the OSCE to quickly reach agreement on 
modalities for the additional military monitoring officers, 
so that the remaining 80 MMOs can be deployed as soon as 
possible.  We also urge Russia to facilitate access to South 
Ossetia for the eight MMOs on the ground prior to the start 
of hostilities, in accordance with the September 8 agreement 
between Presidents Sarkozy and Medvedev. 
 
In closing, Mr. Chairman, the United States reiterates its 
commitment to the people of Georgia and their democratically 
elected government.  We will continue to support Georgia,s 
sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within 
its internationally recognized borders.
