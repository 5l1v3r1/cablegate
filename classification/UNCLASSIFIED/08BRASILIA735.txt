SUBJECT:  Brazil - Areas of Interest in Cooperation With USG on 
Forest Fire Control and Prevention 
 
REF:  BRASILIA 712 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  Brazilian officials have identified a range of areas 
for possible cooperation with the USG on forest fire control and 
prevention.  Opportunities on forest fire themes include: 
interagency coordination; remote monitoring; incident command 
training; fire management; and environmental education.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  The Brazilian environmental protection agency (IBAMA) and its 
forest fire prevention unit (PREVFOGO) are very interested in 
addressing the serious forest fire problem in Brazil.  In recent 
years, the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
USAID, and the U.S. Department of State have all worked 
collaboratively with PREVFOGO on forest fire issues.  IBAMA and 
PREVFOGO continue to seek technical exchange opportunities with the 
USG.  Through recent discussions with Post and a series of seminars 
in March (REFTEL), the following forest fire prevention and control 
themes have been identified and prioritized by PREVFOGO for possible 
future USG collaboration: 
 
- Inter-Agency Fire Management Coordination, USG organizational 
example; 
- U.S. Forest Service development of a recommended National Plan for 
Prevention and Control of Forest Fires in Brazil; 
- Technical and professional capacity building for Brazil's national 
fire prevention and control; 
- Training of U.S. Incident Command System for emergency response, 
interagency coordination, and communication; 
- Monitoring of land condition and heat points via remote sensing 
and other technical applications; 
- Equipment for fire-combat and specialized protection; and 
- Environmental education programs and public outreach. 
 
¶3.  COMMENT:  Forest fire prevention and control in Brazil will play 
an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by Brazil in 
the future.  Technical assistance by USG agencies on the fire 
management themes identified could help the Brazilian authorities 
better address this serious problem.  END COMMENT.
