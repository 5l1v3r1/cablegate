¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
--------------- 
 
"Talk Is Free" 
 
--------------- 
 
Isam Dari, an editorialist in government-owned Tishreen, wrote 
(9/21):  "The world and its peoples are accustomed to hearing 
elegant and flowery words from most of the speakers at UN General 
Assembly sessions.  Year after year we hear speeches about the 
need for international peace, love, dialogue, abandonment of 
weapons of mass destruction, and so on.  But this remains useless 
talk.  The resolutions and the recommendations of every UN 
General Assembly session remain locked in drawers, even though 
they are not binding, contrary to Security Council resolutions, 
especially those issued under Chapter Seven, which appear to have 
been designed specifically against the Arabs.... 
 
 
"The United Nations has become a weapon in the hands of 
superpowers, specifically the United States.... These superpowers 
opposed reforms that other nations tried to introduce to the 
international organization.... 
"The international situation today is very serious.  Tensions, 
explosions, and flagrant interferences have made instability in 
all parts of the world the rule, not the exception.  This has 
driven observers and concerned parties to warn that the United 
Nations might face the fate of the League of Nations.  All 
indications are that this warning is legitimate and 
justified...." 
 
----------------------------- 
 
"The UN, Disappointing Wager" 
 
----------------------------- 
 
Hanan Hamad, a commentator in government-owned Tishreen, wrote 
(9/21):  "The US position toward the Arab League's attempt to 
revive the Arab peace plan in the Security Council shows that the 
United States has no desire for a comprehensive peace process 
that might defuse the increasing mines of tension in the 
region.... 
 
"We wonder how the UN General Assembly can help settle the Arab- 
Israeli conflict while all its previous resolutions are 
frozen.... The UN General Assembly session can only be seen as an 
oratorical platform for the presentation of divergent views." 
 
------------------------------------- 
 
"Questioning Criminals is What Counts" 
 
------------------------------------- 
 
Omar Jaftali, an editorialist in government-owned Tishreen, wrote 
(9/21):  "The UN human rights commissioner has announced that a 
three-man team will investigate Israel's human rights violations 
in Lebanon and prepare a report on the results of its 
findings.... Of course Israel will not be held accountable for 
its violations, because of Washington's support for Tel Aviv.... 
 
"It will be the responsibility of the United Nations to regain 
its credibility regarding its resolutions and the issues of human 
rights which are violated continuously, especially in the Middle 
East as a result of Israeli aggression and occupation.... 
 
"What matters at the end of the day is to hold criminals to 
account, not to add another report to the reports that have 
filled the drawers of the United Nations and have become covered 
by dust without seeing the light of day."
