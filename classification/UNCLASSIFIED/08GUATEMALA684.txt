SOLIDARITY WITH THE CUBAN PEOPLE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 51536 
 
Embassy Guatemala placed an editorial under Ambassador 
Derham's name in leading Guatemalan newspaper "Prensa Libre" 
on May 21 in commemoration of the Day of Solidarity with the 
Cuban People.  Pol/Econ Counselor, drawing on his previous 
experience as PAO Havana, discussed the plight of Cuban 
political prisoners, the dissident movement, and economic and 
human rights conditions in Cuba on "La Primera Hora," one of 
Guatemala's most popular radio talk shows.  "La Primera Hora" 
invited the Cuban Embassy to respond during the live program, 
but the Cuban Embassy declined to do so.  Pol/Econ Counselor 
also covered the same topics during a roundtable with 
newspaper journalists from "El Periodico," "Siglo XXI," and 
"Diario de Centro America."
