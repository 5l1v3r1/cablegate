¶1. (U) Kuwait Red Crescent Society (KRCS) President Barges 
Al-Barges told emboffs January 30 that Kuwait had pledged a 
total of USD 3.5 million, KRCS had already sent USD one 
million to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red 
Crescent (IFRC), spent an additional USD 330,000 to purchase 
in-kind emergency relief supplies as agreed upon by the IFRC, 
and that disbursement of the remaining funds is under review 
"to ensure the funds go to the best effort".  Emboffs thanked 
the Kuwaiti government, and the KCRS, for their contributions 
to Haiti relief. (ref a). 
 
¶2. (U) Al-Barges sought clarification as to whether U.S. 
military airlift would be available to transport Kuwaiti 
tents to Haiti as had originally been requested by Health 
Minister Al-Sayer January 18. (ref b).  Econoff explained the 
logistical challenges involved, noted that clearance was 
still pending, and suggested that if KCRS could arrange 
transport itself it should do so to avoid further delay. 
 
¶3. (U) Red Crescent Humanitarian Assistance coordinator 
Yousef Al-Merag confirmed to Econoff February 1 press 
accounts that day indicating that KCRS had dispatched an 
aircraft carrying 750 tents for Haiti.  Al-Merag said the 
Amir had provided an aircraft from the Amiri fleet (likely 
his personal 747, which is not cargo configured) to move two 
separate shipments of 750 tents each (1500 total) immediately 
to Haiti via the Dominican Republic.  Al-Merag was open to 
the possibility of providing further tents should U.S. 
military assets be made available to move them.
