SUBJECT: EXBS; TURKISH COMMENTS TO LATEST NP COOPERATION 
AND ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT DRAFT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 270520 
 
¶1.  This is an action request- see para 4. 
 
¶2.  We have discussed the latest U.S. draft NP Cooperation 
and Assistance Agreement (ref A) with MFA Arms Control and 
Disarmament Department Head Sabri Ergen and other MFA 
representatives on several occasions since originally 
delivering it to the GOT on December 21. In early January, 
MFA distributed the latest draft agreement to other GOT 
ministries for comments.  On February 4, MFA provided us with 
comments on the latest draft. 
 
¶3. The following are the changes requested by the GOT to the 
text in refcable. (We sent a word document of the text with 
these changes by email to NP/ECC.): 
 
a.  Part II- line 3 insert "special" before consumption tax 
 
b.  Part II- line 4 insert "(including stamp duty)" after or 
duties 
 
c.  Part V Paragraph (c)- line 5 insert ", the Latter paying 
the relevant expenses for this return."  after the United 
States. 
 
¶4.  Action request:  We request the Department review and 
advise whether the USG will accept the suggested changes to 
the NP Cooperation Agreement. If these changes are 
acceptable, we will request a Turkish language copy of the 
Agreement for review.  Note: Following the signing by both 
governments, the GOT will need to submit the Agreement to 
their parliament for final approval. 
 
¶5.  Comment: The GOT comments appear intended to make the 
Agreement accurately reflect the types of taxes and duties 
that are in Turkey.  The GOT also appears to want to avoid 
any financial liability for the return of equipment provided 
by the United States in this agreement. Both Governments have 
worked hard on this agreement for over two years and the 
continuation of significant parts of the EXBS program depend 
on the completion of this agreement.  Quick evaluation and 
reply would be appreciated.
