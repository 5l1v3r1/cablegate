"Bush's Plan" 
 
The lead editorial in liberal, largest national circulation daily 
Folha de S. Paulo (1/12) asserted: "By announcing the sending of 
additional 20,000 troops to Iraq, President George W. Bush ignored 
the wishes of even many of his allies.  The White House's new 
strategy contradicts the US Council of former Military Commanders in 
Iraq.... Bush's decision also opposes the military and political 
experience acquired over the past four years in Iraq. Similar 
attempts failed.... Of course, there was some progress in the 
presidential course towards a less obscure view of reality. Bush 
admitted for the first time the possibility of the US leaving Iraq 
defeated and recognized having committed strategic mistakes. 
Everything indicates that the new plan is another such mistake.... 
Of course, the new plan could theoretically help to pacify 
Baghdad.... The problem with the new strategy is that it depends on 
many 'ifs.' Even 35,000 troops are few to police a disturbed 6 
million-inhabitant city.... Part of the Shiite militias fostering 
the civil war has infiltrated the Iraqi army. The idea of bringing 
Kurd troops from the northern region is also troublesome. The best 
chance the Kurds have to form an independent national state depends 
on the fragmentation of Iraq. The proposal of making social 
investments to follow military actions is a good one, but it seems 
too late for that.... The truth is that the war in Iraq was a 
complete disaster. President Bush speaks about victory and proposes 
an escalation of a conflict that, at the current moment, can hardly 
tolerate a military solution. And worse, he does that by 
contradicting everything and everyone."
