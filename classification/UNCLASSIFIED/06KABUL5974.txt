SUBJECT: PHASE III, TIER I ANP LTC - BIODATA FOR LEAHY VETTING, PART 
ONE OF TWO 
 
¶1. This is an action request, see para 4. 
¶2. (U) In order to comply with Leahy requirements, post is 
forwarding the names and biodata of 91 Afghan officers selected to 
serve as Lieutenant Colonels in Phase III, Tier 1 of the Afghan 
National Police (ANP) rank and reform process. Post requests 
expedited clearance of these officers because they are slated for 
critical leadership posts in the southern and eastern provinces. In 
order to increase the presence of Afghan National Security Forces 
(ANSF) in these key areas, it is vital that we move urgently with 
ANP leadership assignments, per reftel. 
 
¶3. (U) The United Nations Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has vetted 
these individuals and has found no credible evidence of human rights 
violations. (Note: of the initial list of names provided by MOI, 
UNAMA found 20 instances of human rights violations.  These 
individuals have been removed from this list.  End note.) When there 
are individuals with one name, Post has made a good faith to effort 
to ensure that the individuals with one name only actually have one 
name. This is the first of two cables containing the ANP Phase III, 
Tier One lieutenant colonels. It contains 50 names.  Post requests a 
completion date by January 17.
