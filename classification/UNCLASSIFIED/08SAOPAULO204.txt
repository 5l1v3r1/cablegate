Column by Eliane Cantanhde in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (4/22) 
states: "A union leader in Brazil, a true Indian in Bolivia, a 
nationalist colonel with leftist leanings in Venezuela and, now, a 
former bishop in Paraguay. ... For centuries, the elites [in South 
America] failed to promote development, real independence and, most 
of all, social equality. In the 2000's, alternatives are sought... . 
The political leadership of President-elect Fernando Lugo was 
formed, in theory, by the Liberation Theology and, in practice, by 
years of close relationship with the misery facing South America's 
second poorest country... . [He] Inherited a broken economy, 
excessive dependency on Itaipu, sweeping corruption and contraband 
practiced in plain view... . The former-bishop...indicated that he 
tends to balance a conciliatory spirit with the need for tension, 
provocation and even transgression against old habits in order to 
manage a country in desperate need of reforms, especially in its 
political culture." 
 
Latin America 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S.Paulo(4/22) states: "Fernando Lugo's 
victory in Paraguay closes a wide cycle of changes in governments of 
Latin America. Party-machines and dictatorships that lasted for 
decades were ousted in the last 25 years... . The situation nowadays 
is one of deep divide in many countries... . Paraguay will probably 
join the list... . Brazil [is seen] as an exception, as it is 
considered a 'sensible' leftist government... . Lula chose to work 
with traditional political forces... . In the countries that are 
deeply divided today, the opposite happened... . It is hard to tell 
which path is the least harmul to democracy and to the 
establishment of stanards of income distribution that are decent at 
a inimum. But to be able to leave behind dictatorshis and 
one-party systems is a great progress." 
Lugo's Victory 
 
Liberal Folha de S.Paulo (4/22) ditorializes: "Endorsed by a myriad 
of multiple-endencies parties, opposition candidate [Fernando] Lugo 
was the depository of frustrations and the waring and tearing 
accumulated throughout the Colrado [party] mandate, marked by 
corruption, instbility, political violence and administrative 
inefficiency... . All of this social uneasiness was not blamed only 
on the 61-year rule of the Colorado Party. Brazil is also being 
blamed, accused of ripping Paraguay off, especially in the 1973 
Itaipu Treaty... . Lugo may ask whatever he wants, but he knows that 
the chances that Brazil will modify the treaty are dim."
