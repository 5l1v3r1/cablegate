¶1. "Instability Increase in Bolivia" 
 
Business-oriented Valor Economico editorialized (10/5): "President 
Evo Morales is engulfed in another wave of political instability. 
The polarization of forces intensified following the truce 
represented by the Constituent Assembly election and the referendum 
on the Bolivian provinces' autonomy.... The alliance between Morales 
and noisy Venezuelan President Hugo Chvez is another source of 
problems. A military agreement between the two nations, which had 
been kept in secrecy, was revealed in mid September. Its terms are 
not clear, but in the current Bolivian political climate many now 
believe that Venezuelan troops have permission to enter Bolivian 
territory in the event that the Morales administration faces 
problems. Those who think that Morales wants to imitate Chvez have 
their opinions reinforced.... In such a volatile environment, the 
Bolivian government has also found means to irritate foreign 
investors, especially Petrobras and the Brazilian government.... As 
a result, the supply of Bolivian gas to Brazil has never been as 
vulnerable as it is now." 
 
¶2. "Ready For Dialogue" 
 
An editorial in liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de 
¶S. Paulo commented (10/5): "Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's 
willingness to resume peace negotiations with the FARC (Colombian 
Revolutionary Armed Forces), the main guerrilla group operating in 
that nation, is welcome.... Uribe has competently managed the 
guerrilla problem. First he weakened it through military means, and 
now that the guerrilla is very much weakened he suggests a 
dialogue.... If he succeeds, he will be considered a statesman. He 
will have healed the open wound that has tormented the Colombians' 
life for four decades and caused thousands of deaths."
