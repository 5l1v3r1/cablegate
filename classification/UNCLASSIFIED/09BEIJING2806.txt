  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
"U.S. politics will hinder efforts to counter global warming" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(09/30)(pg 2): 
"The Democratic Party in the United States has prepared for the 
worst: when necessary, climate change can be compromised for health 
care reform.  For this reason, environmentalists now are concerned 
about Obama's health care reform bill getting passed in Congress. 
Whether or not this bill passes, U.S. politics will certainly hinder 
international efforts to combat global warming, because Democratic 
Senators might not be united in pushing for the passage of Obama's 
clean energy bill.  Next year's congressional election has also 
raised the question of how U.S. legislators will choose between 
voters' interests and moral concerns over climate change.  The EU is 
always trying to set an example for the U.S. in combating global 
warming.  Currently, the main disputes between the EU and the U.S. 
are over whether or not to continue the framework established under 
the Kyoto protocol or establish a new one.  The U.S. still refuses 
to accept the proposal advocated by the EU that an international 
supervision system be established to push forward global cooperation 
on emissions reduction." 
 
¶2.  IRAN 
 
"U.S. plans to implement stricter sanctions against Iran" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/30)(pg 2): "It seems that Iran's game of 
'missile plus nuclear bomb' has caused Western countries, including 
the U.S., to lose patience.  It is still a concern, though, whether 
or not stricter sanctions will succeed in getting Iran to compromise 
or cause it to again abandon negotiations.  Chinese expert Tang 
Zhichao at the China Institute of Contemporary International 
Relations (CICIR) said there is little possibility that China will 
participate in UN sanctions against Iran.  If the U.S. implements 
sanctions, this is a step backwards.  Yuan Peng, Director of the 
CICIR's U.S. Studies Institute, said that U.S.-Iran relations are 
'not normal.'  China and Iran have normal relations in the fields of 
energy, politics, economics, and trade, but the U.S. and Iran do 
not.  Thus, U.S.-Iran relations are 'not normal.'  There are still 
many uncertainties over Iran's 'missile plus nuclear bomb' policy. 
The website, 'the Middle East online,' believes Israel is preparing 
to do something big.  The Israeli media has also revealed that are 
two possible air strike plans against Israel." 
 
¶3.  CHINA'S FUTURE CHALLENGES 
 
"China must directly face the challenges of being a great power" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/30)(pg 14): "Among the 60 experts 
interviewed by Global Times, most believe that China has solved its 
three most important problems: providing food and clothing to its 
citizens, gaining independence, and becoming part of the 
international community.  In the future, China will have to face the 
extremely challenging issue of how, as a country of 1.3 billion 
people, to modernize.  In addition to limited resources and other 
countries' jealousy, the shifting global balance of power will 
create challenges for China in the future.  Whether or not China can 
gain the goodwill and support of great powers is very important. 
The disintegration of the former Soviet Union and the financial 
crisis in the U.S. have shown that the mistakes of great powers can 
have serious results.  China, which is going through an important 
period of growth in its development, should be wary of such 
tragedies happening to us.  China has no way back and has to 
confront the risks and challenges of the future.  China has to 
explore this new road by itself."
