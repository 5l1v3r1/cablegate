Â¶1. (SBU)  Traffic on the Bridge Bypass Road built to link 
Caracas to the main air and sea ports has resumed on both 
lanes for heavy and light traffic, with some intermittent 
closures.  The Ministry of Infrastructure (MINFRA) has 
announced possible closures from 10PM-4AM to reinforce the 
steep pitching against landslide damage.  The Association of 
Engineers of Venezuela (CIV) studied road conditions and 
ascertained that it would take six weeks to adequately 
fortify the pitching against landslide damage, during which 
the road would have to be closed.  The CIV also said publicly 
that the poor quality of the road was due to the hastiness 
with which it was built. (Note: CIV accurately predicted the 
collapse of the bridge and the current problems with the 
bypass road.  End Note).  As the rains continue, further 
landslide damage is expected, unless MINFRA can install 
adequate barriers and make necessary repairs.
