Title- Provocation diplomacy 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4-16) states: "The launch of 
a rocket by North Korea, on the fifth, revived regional tensions and 
generated the country's [North Korea] condemnation by the U.N.'s 
Security Council.  Nonetheless, it will probably not change the game 
of provocation and restraint that marks the country's relation with 
the international community....Despite international progress in the 
nuclear program and in the new hostile gesture against the 
international community, the miserable North Koreans keeps being 
susceptible to negotiations that offer economic help in exchange for 
the bomb's renunciation.  Global diplomacy should continue to bet 
all its cards on this route." 
 
Title- Cuba 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4-16) by Kenneth Maxwell says: 
"Obama is walking on a razor's edge.  He chose Dan Restrepo....to 
announce the changes [in restrictions to Cuba].  But the announced 
measures reflect a real change in the U.S. attitude with 
Havana....Fidel Castro wrote that the policy was 'positive but 
minimal'.  In other words: steps in the right direction." 
 
Title- Route to Teheran 
 
Op-ed in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (4-16) by sociologist 
Demtrio Magnoli notes: "Today Washington needs Teheran to avoid a 
disaster in Afghanistan and hinder Iraq's destabilization....But 
Iran will not lower its flag in exchange of nothing.....The 
reconstruction of a peace process between Israel, the Palestinians 
and Syria is a minimum effort that Teheran expects Washington to 
make.  Obama will fail if he does not confront Israel's new 
government, which rejects the commitment to a two state principle 
with Palestine..."
