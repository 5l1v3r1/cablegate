SUBJECT: BRAZIL CLAIMS AMAZON DESTRUCTION IS DECLINING 
 
 
¶1.  The rate of deforestation of the Amazon is slowing according to 
preliminary estimates announced by the Government of Brazil (GoB). 
According to the data from the Ministry of Environment (MMA), the 
country's deforestation rate has likely declined 11 % when compared 
to 2004-2005 figures.  This will be the second consecutive 
deforestation rate drop under the administration of Environment 
Minister Marina Silva. 
 
¶2.  According to the MMA, in the period from August 2004 to August 
2005 approximately 18,793 square km of the Amazon were deforested, a 
31 % drop when compared to the same period a year before, the best 
result since 1997.  GoB estimates show a probable 11 % drop in these 
numbers for the same period in the 2005-2006 figures.  Mato Grosso 
is still the leading state in terms of deforestation, even tough it 
presented a 34 % percent estimated reduction when compared to last 
year.  Sao Felix do Xingu, a city in the state of Para, is the 
single largest municipal culprit in terms of deforestation. However, 
local government has already presented a plan to cut down 
deforestation in that state. 
 
¶3.  According to the Ministry current methodology, the deforestation 
area will lie around 16,700 square km this year.  Mato Grosso is 
responsible for half of the devastated area.  "We will have two 
consecutive years with a rate less than 20,000 square km, returning 
to levels of the mi-1990s", said Joao Paulo Capobianco, the MMA's 
secretary of biodiversity and forests.  Brazil's highest rate of 
 
SIPDIS 
destruction took place in 1995, when over 28,000 square km were 
deforested.  Nevertheless, the NGO Greenpeace has questioned the 
number arguing that they have a study that points out an 8.4% raise 
in deforestation rate. 
 
¶4.  Comment:  It is evident that good work is being done by Minister 
Marina Silva's administration.  Three main factors are responsible 
for this reduction: intensified monitoring of logging, stricter 
control and increased organization of land titling and tenure and 
the creation of 18 conservation units.  Although a lot more needs to 
be done, if the figures prove correct, it will be the first time in 
over a decade that two consecutive decrease in deforestation rates 
have taken place.  End Comment
