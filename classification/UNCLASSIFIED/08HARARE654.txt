On the Political/Social Front 
----------------------------- 
 
Negotiations to Resume...  ZANU-PF and the MDC will resume 
negotiations on August 3 in Pretoria.  Progress is reportedly being 
made with an agreement possible by the end of the week to form a 
power-sharing government that will include Mugabe and Tsvangirai 
with both having executive powers.  See Harare 651. 
 
Violence Continues...  Despite the MOU between ZANU-PF and the MDC 
that calls for a cessation to the violence, pockets of Zimbabwe 
continue to experience violence and intimidation.  In some villages, 
people have been forced to pay ZANU-PF militias livestock, food, and 
money to "atone" for their affiliation with MDC.  In addition, the 
Solidarity Peace Trust has issued a new report detailing political 
events in Zimbabwe since the March 29 elections and the ongoing 
political violence. http://www.solidaritypeacetrust.org/reports/ 
desperately_seeking_sanity.pdf   See also Harare 652. 
 
U.S. Expands Financial Sanctions...  President Bush issued a new 
Executive Order on July 25 expanding financial sanctions against 
Zimbabweans involved in undermining democracy and committing human 
rights violations.  The Treasury Department also added new entities 
to the list of sanctioned individuals.  In response, many have 
contacted the embassy both requesting clarification on their 
transactions and proposing additional individuals and companies for 
the list.  The new E.O. is at:

foods earlier than normal.  The report estimates that two million 
Zimbabweans are at risk of food insecurity this year. 
 
Harare's Water Woes Worsens...  Further symptomatic of Zimbabwe's 
crumbling infrastructure, the Zimbabwe National Water Authority 
(ZINWA) is increasingly unable to maintain water supplies due to 
pipe bursts, electricity blackouts and lack of chemicals.  As a 
result, most Harare suburbs are going for months without running 
water.  The Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) has warned 
of serious looming health problems.  It maintains that the decision 
to create ZINWA was careless and misguided as the organization lacks 
the capacity to run and manage urban water supplies.  The recently 
elected mayor of Harare, Muchadeyi Masunda, voiced similar 
sentiments, and called for the City of Harare to take over the 
function. 
 
Tax-Free Threshold Increased...  The government increased the 
tax-free income threshold from Z$25 billion (US$0.20 before 
revaluation) to Z$5 trillion (US$42) per month.  While the benefit 
to workers might appear to be immense, hyperinflation swiftly pushes 
most formally employed workers up into the highest tax category 
where earnings attract a marginal tax rate of 47.5 percent.
