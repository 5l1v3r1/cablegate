SUBJECT: IOM DEEMS CHINA TAKING POSITIVE STEPS TO FIGHT 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a January 28, 2010 telcon with Embassy Beijing 
and Department representatives, Tom Sinkovits, Head of Office 
for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) 
Liaison Office in Beijing stated that human trafficking was a 
high interest issue in the upper ranks of the Chinese 
government.  While characterizing China's approach to combat 
trafficking as "a work in progress," the IOM official 
nonetheless praised how far China had come in a short time. 
For instance, he noted for U.S. interlocutors that the PRC 
National Plan of Action to combat trafficking had been 
implemented in 2008 and that Chinese officials were working 
closely with IOM to address trafficking related issues. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Sinkowits, China had demonstrated that 
there was high-level political will driving cooperation and 
progress on fighting human trafficking.  He cited signs of 
progress at the provincial level, the recent "serious" 
crackdowns on trafficking by the Ministry of Public Security 
(MPS) and the All-China Women's Federation's interest in 
working to reintegrate trafficking victims into society as 
examples. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Sinkovits told U.S. officials that, from the vantage 
point of IOM, the MPS and Ministry of Civil Affairs work with 
IOM to build coordination among various Chinese government 
agencies to provide support for trafficking victims was a 
positive indicator of the PRC's willingness to work with 
international partners to establish best practices. Sinkowits 
also stated that the Chinese officials were aware of the 
source of IOM funding for these projects, adding that they 
were "grateful" and "welcomed" the U.S. involvement. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Sinkovits also cited the government's efforts to 
expand the MFA's consular department to provide support to 
Chinese victims of trafficking abroad as a clear sign that 
China is placing more emphasis on the care of Chinese 
victims.  According to IOM, official Chinese government 
figures put the number of known trafficking victims at 
approximately 10,000 women and children.  Of note, Chinese 
officials have now acknowledged that the vast majority of 
these victims were from internal trafficking.  In the past, 
most Chinese government officials refused to acknowledge that 
trafficking was a domestic problem. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Deficiencies still remain, according to Sinkowits. 
He noted that China lacks a legal definition of human 
trafficking and that there remains no clear legislation to 
protect victims of trafficking.  Also of note is that China 
lacks a criminal law related to trafficking in men. 
 
¶6. (SBU) With a worldwide reputation as the leading 
international agency on migration-related issues, the 
diplomatic community in Beijing has found IOM to be a 
reliable point of reference when assessing the government's 
efforts to addressing trafficking.
