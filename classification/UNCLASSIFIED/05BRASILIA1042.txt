SUBJECT:  UPDATE ON THE MERCURY PROBLEM IN BRAZIL, RESULTS 
OF RESEARCH IN STATE OF PARA 
 
¶1.  Summary:  On April 13, 2005, the Brazilian Ministry of 
Science and Technology released the results of research 
completed by their Mineral Technology Center (CETEM) aimed 
at determining the level of mercury contamination of the 
fish in the waters of the Tapajos river, the principle 
source of food for the residents of the state of Para.  The 
study revealed that at least 50 percent of the gold miners 
in the region have health problems caused in part by mercury 
contamination.  The study outlines how mercury contamination 
resulting from the mining process have destroyed the health 
of many in the community and harmed the environment.

The Study

¶2. The study Global Mercury Project - Brazil - Removal of 
Barriers to the Introduction of Cleaner Artisanal Gold 
Mining and Extraction Technologies, was conducted and funded 
by CETEM and Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC) and coordinated 
by GEF and the UN. Initiated in 2003, Brazil was one of six 
countries studied.  Two mining areas in the Tapajos River 
Basin were selected in Brazil -  one phase studied the 
impact on the environment and the other focused on damage to 
the health of the people of the community.

Risks to Humans

¶3.  The study revealed that 65 percent of fish samples 
collected had a mercury concentration above accepted WHO 
levels, reaching as high as 40 percent above.  Of the 700 
people examined, 50 percent had elevated mercury levels in 
their bodies. 
 
¶4. Another study carried out by IEC showed that 60 percent 
of newborns in Itaituba (a city along the Tapajos River) 
born between February and December 2002 suffered impacts of 
mercury contamination. In the 1980s this region was one of 
the largest gold mining sites in the country.

¶5.  The results of the study were discussed in a conference 
held in Brasilia on April 13, organized by the Brazilian 
Ministry of Science and Technology.  Many proposals to 
alleviate this program were discussed, including the most 
obvious of tougher enforcement, since the use of mercury in 
gold mining is forbidden under Brazilian law. The only 
measure officially announced was the launch of a public 
information campaign, targeted towards local miners, on the 
dangers of the use of mercury in gold mining.
