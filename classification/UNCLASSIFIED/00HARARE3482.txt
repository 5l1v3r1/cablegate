¶1.   SUMMARY:  THE EUROPEAN UNION OBSERVER MISSION ISSUED AN 
INTERIM STATEMENT ON ZIMBABWE'S JUNE 24-25 PARLIAMENTARY 
ELECTIONS AT MIDNIGHT ON JUNE 25-26.  THE REPORT COVERS THE 
PRE-ELECTION PERIOD AND THE VOTING; A LATER REPORT WILL 
COVER THE VOTE COUNT AND THE POST-ELECTION PERIOD.  THE EU 
DETERMINED THAT: 
 
-- THE ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE VOTED IN LARGE NUMBERS, SHOWING 
DETERMINATION TO INFLUENCE THE FUTURE OF THEIR COUNTRY 
DESPITE VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION. 
 
-- ELECTORAL OFFICIALS DID NOT OPERATE IN AN OPEN AND 
TRANSPARENT MANNER, AND AS A RESULT FAILED TO SECURE THE 
CONFIDENCE OF BOTH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND OF THE 
INSTITUTIONS OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. 
 
-- ADMINISTRATIVE OBSTRUCTIONS IMPEDED THE WORK OF DOMESTIC 
AND INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS.  THIS WAS "NOT DUE TO 
ADMINISTRATIVE INCOMPETENCE BUT TO A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO 
REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INDEPENDENT MONITORING OF THE 
ELECTION." 
 
-- HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION, AND COERCION, 
PARTICULARLY BY ZANU-PF, MARRED THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN. 
"ZANU-PF LEADERS SEEMED TO SANCTION THE USE OF VIOLENCE AND 
INTIMIDATION AGAINST POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND CONTRIBUTED 
SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE CLIMATE OF FEAR SO EVIDENT DURING THE 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN." 
 
-- EU OBSERVERS' "OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE POLLING IS 
HIGHLY POSITIVE."  HOWEVER, THERE WERE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

INTERIM STATEMENT 
 
PIERRE SCHORI 
HEAD OF EU ELECTION OBSERVATION MISSION 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAVE VOTED IN LARGE NUMBERS IN THIS 
WEEKEND'S PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. DESPITE A HIGH LEVEL OF 
VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION DURING THE CAMPAIGN, AND SERIOUS 
FLAWS AND IRREGULARITIES IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, THEY HAVE 
SHOWN A CLEAR DETERMINATION TO INFLUENCE THE FUTURE OF THEIR 
COUNTRY -- BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND THROUGH THE STRUCTURES OF 
CIVIL SOCIETY. 
 
THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES HAVE CO-OPERATED 
WITH ZIMBABWE POLITICALLY AND FINANCIALLY SINCE INDEPENDENCE 
IN 1980. THE EU IS THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR OF DEVELOPMENT 
ASSISTANCE. AS AN ACT OF COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE OF 
ZIMBABWE, THE EU DEPLOYED SOME 190 EXPERIENCED EU OBSERVERS 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, THE LARGEST INTERNATIONAL OBSERVER 
MISSION, WITH THE AIM OF CONTRIBUTING TO A MORE FAVOURABLE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  03482  01 OF 03  261435Z 
CLIMATE FOR THE ELECTIONS. WE SEE OUR PRESENCE HERE AS A 
NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF OUR SUPPORT FOR THE STRUGGLE FOR 
INDEPENDENCE; AND WE WISH TO BUILD A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH 
A PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC ZIMBABWE. 
 
EU OBSERVERS WERE IN GENERAL WARMLY WELCOMED. THEY 
ESTABLISHED CONTACTS WITH POLITICAL PARTIES, LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES AND CIVIL SOCIETY. THEY ATTENDED SOME ONE 
HUNDRED POLITICAL RALLIES.  THE EU MISSION ALSO BENEFITED 
FROM CO-OPERATION WITH THE MONITORS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL 
OBSERVER MISSIONS. 
 
THE EU ELECTION OBSERVATION MISSION'S ASSESSMENT OF THE 
ELECTORAL PROCESS FALLS INTO THREE PHASES: THE ELECTION 
PREPARATIONS AND CAMPAIGN; VOTING AND THE COUNT; AND THE 
POST-ELECTION PERIOD. A FINAL REPORT WILL BE PRESENTED ON 3 
JULY 2000. 
 
THE PRE-ELECTION PERIOD AND THE CAMPAIGN 
 
IT IS CLEAR FROM THE DAILY REPORTS AND WEEKLY ASSESSMENTS 
MADE BY EU OBSERVERS IN EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT THERE 
WERE SERIOUS FLAWS AND FAILURES IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.

THE BODY EFFECTIVELY RUNNING THE ELECTIONS, THE OFFICE OF 
THE REGISTRAR-GENERAL, DID NOT OPERATE IN AN OPEN AND 
TRANSPARENT MANNER, AND AS A RESULT FAILED TO SECURE THE 
CONFIDENCE OF BOTH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND OF THE 
INSTITUTIONS OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. 
 
THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION, WHICH IS 
CONSTITUTIONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING THE ELECTORAL 
PROCESS, WAS SYSTEMATICALLY RENDERED INEFFECTIVE BY BOTH 
LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE MEANS. 
 
CHANGES MADE TO THE ELECTORAL REGULATIONS ONLY DAYS BEFORE 
THE VOTE, TOGETHER WITH A SERIES OF DELIBERATE 
ADMINISTRATIVE OBSTRUCTIONS, SEVERELY UNDERMINED THE ABILITY 
OF DOMESTIC MONITORS TO CARRY OUT THEIR WORK. THE EU 
ELECTION OBSERVATION MISSION REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT 
THIS WAS NOT DUE TO ADMINISTRATIVE INCOMPETENCE BUT TO A 
DELIBERATE ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 
INDEPENDENT MONITORING OF THE ELECTION. SIMILAR OBSTRUCTIONS 
WERE PLACED IN THE WAY OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS. 
 
VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION 
 
HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENCE, INTIMIDATION AND COERCION MARRED 
THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN. AN ASSESSMENT OF VIOLENCE AND 
INTIMIDATION SINCE FEBRUARY 2000 MADE BY THE EU ELECTION 
OBSERVATION MISSION, TOGETHER WITH REPORTS FROM EU OBSERVERS 
OPERATING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SINCE EARLY JUNE, INDICATE 
THAT ZANU-PF WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BULK OF POLITICAL 
VIOLENCE.

PAGE 03        HARARE  03482  02 OF 03  261435Z 
 
ZANU-PF LEADERS SEEMED TO SANCTION THE USE OF VIOLENCE AND 
INTIMIDATION AGAINST POLITICAL OPPONENTS AND CONTRIBUTED 
SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE CLIMATE OF FEAR SO EVIDENT DURING THE 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN. CALLS FOR PEACEFUL CAMPAIGNING AND 
EFFORTS TO RESTRAIN PARTY SUPPORTERS, INCLUDING THE WAR 
VETERANS, WERE OFTEN AMBIGUOUS.  OVERALL, THE CONDUCT OF THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW AND 
COMPROMISED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. 
 
MDC SUPPORTERS WERE ALSO ENGAGED IN VIOLENCE AND 
INTIMIDATION, BUT THE DEGREE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
SUCH ACTIVITIES WAS FAR LESS. MOREOVER, MDC LEADERS WERE 
CLEARER IN THEIR CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE. 
 
THE LEVELS OF VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION, AND THE ABILITY TO 
CAMPAIGN IN RELATIVE PEACE, VARIED CONSIDERABLY FROM ONE 
PART OF THE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER. EU OBSERVERS MONITORED 
SCORES OF POLITICAL RALLIES IN ALL PROVINCES OF THE COUNTRY 
ORGANISED BOTH BY ZANU-PF AND MDC. 
 
IN THE MAJOR CITIES, ALTHOUGH INTIMIDATION WAS FAR FROM 
ABSENT, THE CAMPAIGN WAS ROBUST. IN MANY RURAL AREAS, 
HOWEVER, THE LEVELS OF INTIMIDATION BY ZANU-PF WERE SO 
INTENSE AS TO MAKE IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE 
OPPOSITION TO CAMPAIGN. 
 
MEDIA COVERAGE 
 
DURING THE CAMPAIGN THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED MEDIA DID NOT 
PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE POLITICAL PARTIES CONTESTING THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  03482  02 OF 03  261435Z 
ELECTION. BOTH THE PUBLIC BROADCASTER, THE ZBC, AND 
GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED NEWSPAPERS WERE USED AS PUBLICITY 
VEHICLES FOR ZANU-PF. THE ZBC FAILED TO ENSURE INFORMED 
POLITICAL DEBATE. PROPAGANDA CROWDED OUT THE REAL ISSUES OF 
THE CAMPAIGN. OPPOSITION PARTIES HAVE HAD TO RELY ON 
COMMERCIAL MEDIA ONLY. 
 
VOTING AND THE COUNT 
 
GENERALLY SPEAKING THE VOTING WAS CALM AND WELL ORGANISED. 
THE EU OBSERVER TEAMS, WORKING IN CO-ORDINATION WITH OTHER 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS, AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF CIVIC 
ORGANISATIONS, VISITED SOME 1,700 POLLING STATIONS OVER THE 
TWO DAYS OF VOTING, MORE THAN 40 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL. 
 
THEIR OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE POLLING IS HIGHLY POSITIVE. 
PRESIDING OFFICERS AND THEIR STAFF ON THE WHOLE WERE 
COMPETENT AND EFFICIENT.  THERE WERE, HOWEVER, SERIOUS 
PROBLEMS CONCERNING THE VOTERS' ROLL AND THE NUMBER OF 
INTENDING VOTERS WHO WERE UNABLE TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS. 
MOREOVER, AS A RESULT OF THE OBSTRUCTIONS PLACED IN THE WAY 
OF DOMESTIC MONITORS, THEIR EFFECTIVENESS WAS SERIOUSLY 
COMPROMISED.

LATER STAGE. 
 
INTERIM ASSESSMENT 
 
IN SUMMARY, THE VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION DURING THE PRE- 
ELECTION PERIOD MUST BE CONDEMNED. THE COURTS SHOULD DEAL 
WITH ALL CASES OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
ELECTORAL PROCESS. THIS WILL BE ESSENTIAL IN HELPING TO RE- 
ESTABLISH RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW IN ZIMBABWE. 
 
THE SERIOUS DEFECTS IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, PARTICULARLY 
IN REGARD TO THE VOTERS' ROLL AND THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY 
OF THE ELECTORAL AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AS A MATTER 
OF URGENCY. 
 
WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENCE OF INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS HAD 
A CALMING AND STABILISING EFFECT. 
 
WE COMMEND THE IMPRESSIVE MANNER IN WHICH THE PEOPLE OF 
ZIMBABWE HAVE SHOWN THEIR DETERMINATION TO INFLUENCE THEIR 
OWN DESTINY. 
 
THE POST-ELECTION PERIOD 
 
OUR FINAL ASSESSMENT WILL COVER THE WHOLE PROCESS INCLUDING 
THE IMMEDIATE POST-ELECTION PERIOD. THE REPORT WILL BE 
PRESENTED TO EUROPEAN UNION MEMBERS STATES, TO THE EUROPEAN 
PARLIAMENT AND TO THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, AS WELL AS TO THE 
EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT FUND (EDF) WHICH WILL MEET ON 5 JULY 
¶2000. THE ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED WILL INCLUDE:

-- THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE NEW DISPENSATION IN ZIMBABWE 
RESPECTS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE; 
 
-- HOW THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE COUNTRY 
ACCOMMODATES THE NEW POLITICAL REALITIES; 
 
-- THE MANNER IN WHICH THE POLITICAL FORCES WITHIN THE 
COUNTRY WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS CONFRONTING 
ZIMBABWE; 
 
-- THE EXTENT TO WHICH RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THE 
PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS PROMOTED BY THE NEW 
GOVERNMENT; AND 
 
-- WHAT EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO ENSURE THAT POLITICALLY- 
MOTIVATED CRIMES AND ELECTORAL MALPRACTICE ARE PURSUED. 
 
WITH HIGH AUTHORITY COMES HIGH RESPONSIBILITY. THE PRESIDENT 
OF ZIMBABWE WILL HAVE TO PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THE POST 
ELECTION PHASE.
