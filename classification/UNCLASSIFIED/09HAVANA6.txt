SUBJECT: Request for Waiver of Section 565 Prohibition against 
Contracting with Firms that Comply with the Arab League Boycott or 
 
Discriminate on Basis of Religion 
 
REF: 08 STATE 132944 
 
¶1.   USINT Havana requests a waiver of Section 565 of Title V, Part 
C of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal year 1994 and 
1995 (PL 103-236) (22 USC 2679c) as it applies to contracts that 
expend funds appropriated to the Department of State, and that would 
go to persons who comply with the Arab League Boycott of Israel, or 
who discriminate in the award of subcontracts on the basis of 
religion. 
 
¶2.   In accordance with the terms of both restrictions, USINT Havana 
would be required to avoid contracting with the Cuban government, or 
with entities under the control of the Cuban government.  However, 
the Cuban government requires all diplomatic missions to contract 
with one government entity, CUBALSE, for all requirements for 
supplies and services.  As the sole supplier to the diplomatic 
community, there is no option for USINT Havana to seek another 
source.  CUBALSE writes all the contracts itself and does not accept 
contracts written by others, nor will it accept any additional 
clauses of any nature by anyone.  The Cuban government also severely 
restricts the importation of goods and services from outside of 
Cuba.  Without local suppliers of goods and services, USINT Havana 
would be unable to carry out the functions assigned to it as a 
diplomatic mission.
