SUBJECT: LAW SOCIETY LEADERS FREED AFTER 48 HOURS IN JAIL 
 
 
    ¶1.   Law Society of Zimbabwe (LSZ) President Sternford Moyo 
       and LSZ Executive Secretary Wilbert Mapombere were released 
       from police custody on June 5 after spending 48 hours in 
       custody on charges of plotting to overthrow the government 
       of Robert Mugabe.  The two have been ordered to appear at 
       the Harare Magistrates' Court on June 6 to be formally 
       charged for contravening a section of the newly enacted 
       Public Order and Security Act (POSA). 
 
    ¶2.   Moyo and Mapombere are alleged to have written letters 
       to the British High Commission in Harare and the opposition 
       Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), calling for the 
       suspension of crisis talks between the opposition MDC and 
       Mugabe's ruling ZANU PF party.  The government also accused 
       Moyo and Mapombere of writing letters in support of mass 
       action.  The two men have denied the charges as "fabricated 
       and without any legal foundation." 
 
    ¶2.   Meanwhile, the High Court of Zimbabwe ruled that Moyo 
        and Mapombere's arrest was lawful.  The ruling by Judge 
        President Justice Garwe in Harare yesterday dismissed an 
        application by the two lawyers that sought to have the 
        arrest and detention declared unlawful.
