SUBJECT:  Lebanon: Media Reaction - June 30, 2009 
 
Atmospherics: 
------------- 
 
Media outlets highlighted the Syrian-Saudi consultations that were 
taking place in Damascus regarding the formulation of the new 
Lebanese government.  The media noted that these Saudi-Syrian 
consultations seemed more important than Prime Minister-designate 
Saad Hariri's consultations with parliamentary blocks in Beirut. 
The media seemed undecided on whether these Syrian-Saudi 
consultations will give Syria back the role it used to play in 
Lebanon before its troops withdrew in 2005.  A number of media 
outlets seemed apprehensive, while others noted that a dual 
Syrian-Saudi role in Lebanon will be constructive, remove obstacles, 
and facilitate the formation of a new government.

"Syria Will Not Exchange 'Money Capital with Its Interest Only' and 
Will Not Pay for a Role it Does Not Want," an editorial by Imad 
Marmal in Arab nationalist As-Safir (6/30): 
 
"If you want to know what is going on in Beirut, you will have to 
know what is going on between Damascus and Riyadh.  This regional 
formula had an impact on Lebanon before, and it seems that it will 
have an important impact today.  ...It is clear that Saudi Arabia is 
looking for a Saudi-Syrian dual role in managing Lebanese affairs. 
Saudi Arabia believes that Syria will be attracted to playing this 
role with Saudi Arabia, and eventually it will be lenient on issues 
related to demarcation of the border with Lebanon, Palestinian 
weapons in Lebanon and other issues.  ...Syria, however, is looking 
at this issue differently.  It believes that its current position on 
Lebanon keeps it inside and outside Lebanon at the same time.  Syria 
believes that this position suits its interests bcause it makes her 
look as if it respects Lebano's sovereignty and independence..." 
 
"The Syrian-Saudi Meetings Compete With Government Formulation," an 
editorial by Rosana Bou-Monsef in moderate, anti-Syrian An-Nahar 
(6/30): 
 
"...Political sources say that the visit by King Abdallah's son to 
Damascus, that was officially announced through the Syrian media, 
went into details regarding government formulation in Lebanon. 
...These sources believe, however, that it is too early to believe 
that Syria's conditions and position on the March 14 will change 
despite the Saudi visits.  The Syrians do not give gifts for 
free...and they are certainly not going to gift to Prime-minister 
designate Hariri by facilitating the government formulation.  ...In 
contrast, there are those who believe that a positive and 
constructive Syrian role in Lebanon is a step towards building 
normal relations between the two countries...and will eventually put 
the Syrian-Lebanese relations on the right track..."
