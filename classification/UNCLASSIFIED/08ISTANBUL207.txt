¶1. (U) Conflicts between police and illegal protestors seem 
inevitable as both the government and labor groups have 
staked out firm positions with regard to May Day protests in 
Istanbul's Taksim Sqaure.  The Istanbul Governor had earlier 
denied labor groups' request for permission to march on 
Taksim Square, following a practice that began after May Day 
protests in 1977 resulted in 36 deaths and scores of 
injuries.  Illegal protests in 2007, the 30th anniversary of 
the 1977 deaths, resulted in violent confrontations with the 
police and hundreds of arrests.  On April 29, Prime Minister 
Erdogan refused to yield to union leaders' request to allow 
demonstrators to enter Taksim Square.  A last minute 
compromise was quashed on the morning of April 30 as Interior 
Minister Sahin publicly upheld the protest ban. 
 
¶2. (U) Two major labor unions--DISK and Kesk--have issued a 
joint statement that they "are determined to celebrate May 
Day in Taksim Square". According to press reports, these 
unions vowed to send 500,000 marchers to Taksim on May Day. 
Some commentators claim the government is reluctant to lift 
the protest ban fearing the gathering could turn into an 
anti-Justice and Development Party  (AKP) rally since the 
ruling party recently passed a controversial social security 
package that reduced some worker benefits.  The AKP 
government tried to reach out to labor by declaring May 1  as 
"Labor and Solidarity Day", but this gesture fell short of 
organized labor's demand  the day become a national holiday. 
 
¶3. (U) Since 1977, Turkey has banned May Day celebrations in 
Taksim Square where 36 people were killed when violence broke 
out during the rally.  This ban was upheld largely without 
incident until 2007 when just under 1,000 people were 
arrested when protesters marched on the square despite having 
been denied protest permission (see reftel for details). 
Police responded with water canons and tear gas in an attempt 
to disperse the illegal demonstrators. The violence along 
with police barricades and security checkpoints jammed 
traffic ithroughout the city, creating a transportation 
nightmare for tens of thousands of commuters.   As in 2007, 
permission has been granted for labor rallies in other 
Istanbul neighborhoods including major protest sites in the 
centrally located Kadikoy and Cagalayan districts. 
 
¶4. (U) Istanbul Municipal and Provincial authorities have 
attempted to restrict access to Taksim by potential 
protestors on May 1 by cancelling all ferry service between 
the European and Asian side of the city until noon as well as 
cancelling metro, light rail and bus service to Taksim. 
Nearby primary schools in the Beyoglu, Sisli, and Kagithane 
districts will also be closed.  The Consulate General has 
issued a Warden Message alerting locally resident American 
citizens to the possibility of protests and traffic 
disruptions.  We will monitor the situation throughout the 
day on May 1.
