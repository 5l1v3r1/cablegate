¶1.  (U) Summary.  Charge d'Affaires met with newly appointed 
Minister of Transportation, Jusman Syafi'i Djalil on June 15 to 
discuss a variety of transportation issues.  The Minister welcomed 
the July 9 date for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
technical review and hopes it and the July 2 Bali aviation donors 
conference will continue positive momentum in aviation safety.  The 
Minister discussed the stalled recovery of the flight data recorder 
("black box") from the Adam Air flight which crashed into the ocean 
on January 1.  He said there is still no signed contract for 
recovery, however, Adam Air and Phoenix International are working 
toward a possible solution.  The Minister and Charge also discussed 
the impending U.S. Coast Guard International Ship and Port Facility 
Code (ISPS) demarche.  Minister Djalil said that in the short term 
the GOI will focus on increasing ISPS compliance at a core number of 
larger international ports. End Summary. 
 
Increasing Aviation Safety & Security 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Minister Djalil stated that the Government of Indonesia (GOI) 
has taken positive steps on aviation safety in recent months and 
also said the publicized airline ratings and other actions, "show a 
systematic approach to increasing aviation safety".  The GOI will 
host an aviation donors' conference for partner country governments 
and private organizations on July 2 in Bali in order to open a 
dialog on aviation safety improvements.  The President of the 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) will attend and 
address the conference and may meet with President Yudhoyono. 
Minister Djalil reiterated Indonesia's goal to capture a category 
three ICAO council seat and asked whether the United States will 
support Indonesia in this endeavor.  Minister Djalil also expressed 
thanks for FAA assistance and confirmed the July 9 date for the 
Technical Review. 
 
¶3. (U) The Minister supports the Directorate General of Civil 
Aviation (DGCA) goal of promoting aviation security to a directorate 
level position and thereby increasing the power and visibility of 
aviation security enforcement.  The DGCA also committed to take a 
15-20 member team comprised of DGCA, state run airport authority, 
and airport administration personnel to the United States to meet 
with the Transportation Security Administration and observe U.S. 
airport security in August. 
 
Adam Air 
-------- 
 
¶4. (U) Minister Djalil said that the GOI took to heart the 
statements of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
Chairman during the recent Director General of Civil Aviation's trip 
to Washington.  The GOI brought Adam Air and Phoenix International 
(an American ROV company) together to discuss timing of a potential 
recovery of the flight data recorder from the Adam Air crash on 
January 1 (reftels).  Although there is no signed contract as of 
yet, Adam Air and Phoenix agreed that a remotely operated vehicle 
will be available the second week of July, however it was not clear 
if funds were committed for the ROV.  The Minister predicted the 
black boxes would be recovered at the end of July or early August 
however, Adam Air continues to search for a platform ship for 
recovery operations. 
 
Port Security Heads Up 
---------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) We informed the Minister of the contents of the impending 
ISPS demarche and the possible ramifications if Indonesia is not 
found to be ISPS compliant 90 days after demarche delivery.  The 
Charge made it clear that this meeting did not constitute the 
demarche per se, but that we anticipated instruction on the issue 
soon.  The Minister was aware of the issue and the possibility of 
demarche and thanked the U.S. Coast Guard for past assistance on the 
issue.  He appreciated the Coast Guard's port visit out-briefs as 
the GOI successfully used them to conduct improvement audits on the 
ports visited.  He added that with over 100 international ports, the 
GOI plans to focus ISPS compliance in the short term on a smaller 
core group of larger international ports.  Minister Djalil also 
stated his view that the main challenge to safety and security in 
Indonesian ports is the lack of one clear authority over any 
individual port.  The Ministry is currently discussing increasing 
the authority of the DGST port administrators (AdPels) with port 
stakeholders and is optimistic an agreement will be forthcoming.
