SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: POST-SHIPMENT VERIFICATION: KLIOINVEST, INC., 
MOSCOW, RUSSIA. (End-user: Production Association Mayak) 
 
REFTEL: E-MAIL #207005 DATED 3/25/2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Klioinvest Inc., Moscow, 
Russia. The company is listed on BIS license application: D368648 as 
the ultimate consignee of one (1) GC5019 cylinder of germanium with 
an N-type contact on the outer surface and a P-type contact on the 
surface of an axial well. This item is controlled for anti-terrorism 
reasons under ECCN 1A999. The licensee is Canberra Industries, Inc., 
800 Research Parkway, CT 06450. 
 
¶3. On April 7, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of Klioinvest, Inc., 1-st Magistralny 
tupik, bld.11, Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with 
Valery Fedichkin, General Director, and Alexander Eruslanov, Chief 
Executive Officer. 
 
¶4. As per the instructions in reftel, the end use check was 
conducted on Klioinvest, Inc., the purchaser listed in reftel, not 
the ultimate end user of the commodity.  Therefore, the export 
control team was not able to visually inspect the reftel commodity. 
 
¶5. Valery Fedichkin, General Director of Klioinvest, Inc. told the 
export control team that he purchased Klioinvest, Inc. approximately 
10 years ago. Fedichkin advised the export control team that is was 
easier to purchase a pre-existing company at that time in Russia 
than to go through the bureaucratic obstacles within the Russian 
system of setting up a new business.  Fedichkin stated that 
Klioinvest is a closed joint stock company, and it employs 
approximately 150 people.  Fedichkin told the export control team 
that he did create a second company, called Kliogroup. 
 
¶6. Fedichkin advised the export control team that Klioinvest and 
Kliogroup are not end users of the technology they purchase.  He 
stated that they act as buyers for clients in Russia and the CIS 
countries in securing technology, obtaining the necessary import 
licenses from the Russian government and facilitating the customs 
clearance process. 
 
¶7. Fedichkin told the export control team that he is very 
knowledgeable of the U.S. export laws, and stated that he and his 
company imported the first PC from the United States that went into 
the Mir Space Station in 1989.  He stated that the licensing process 
was a logistical nightmare, but a great learning process. 
 
¶8. Fedichkin told the export control team that the commodity in 
reftel was purchased by Klioinvest, Inc. from Canberra Industries, 
Inc. in the U.S. for Canberra Moscow, a wholly own subsidiary of 
Canberra Industries, Inc. Fedichkin stated that Canberra Moscow 
received the reftel commodity after customs clearance.  Canberra 
Moscow then added its own software to the reftel commodity if 
necessary before shipping it to the Production Association Mayak, 
the ultimate end user located in Ozyorsk, Russia.  The export 
control team did not verify that the reftel commodity is at the 
Production Association Mayak. 
 
¶9. Fedichkin stated that he has been doing business with Canberra 
Moscow for approximately 10 years.  The General Director of the 
Canberra Moscow office is Oleg Toritsyn, telephone number: 
+7-495-429-6611. 
 
¶10. Fedichkin also stated that he has been a long time distributor 
for the U.S. companies Andrews Corporation and Comscope. 
 
¶11. The export control team found no indications of impropriety at 
Klioinvest and did not find Valery Fedichkin, General Director of 
Klioinvest evasive when answering the ECO's questions. 
 
¶12. Recommendations: Post advises that there is additional 
information which was provided by another agency which should be 
considered when making a final license determination.
