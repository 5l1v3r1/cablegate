In Today's Papers 
 
Iraqi PM al-Maliki in Ankara 
All papers:  The visit of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to 
Turkey receives broad coverage, with the primary focus on issues 
surrounding the PKK presence in northern Iraq. Papers report that 
al-Maliki assured Ankara that his government would never allow the 
presence of elements that constitute a threat to the security of 
Iraq's neighbors.  However, when asked if there were concrete steps 
planned, besides the closure of PKK offices, Al-Maliki declined to 
respond.  At a joint press conference, PM Erdogan stressed that the 
control of Kirkuk should not be given to a single ethnic group and 
warned against fraud in moves to work out disagreements about 
Kirkuk.  Assuring Erdogan on the issue, the Iraqi premier said 
"Kirkuk is Iraq's city and it will stay in possession of Iraqis in 
line with the new Iraqi Constitution.  We won't let any Iraqi face 
injustice in the region."  Sabah reports that, following his meeting 
with his Turkish counterpart Edip Baser, Iraqi special envoy for 
countering the PKK Shirwan al-Waili said "we are determined to end 
PKK activities, but we want to solve the problem through peaceful 
means.  We are against military operations targeting the PKK in 
northern Iraq." 
 
Commentators continued to speculate on the US policy for Iraq as 
well as Iraq's future. 
Cengiz Candar writing in the conservative Bugun notes that President 
Bush is calling in his father's advisors, but sees little cause for 
optimism that a solution to the Iraq problem will be found:  "In the 
US, every official or unofficial institution is eagerly working on 
finding ways to exit from Iraq.  So far these efforts have come to 
no avail, and in the long run it will most likely remain that way. 
The fact of the matter is there is no exit way to find. Displaying a 
certain helplessness, President Bush now seems closer to his 
father's team, including some well-known names like the new Defense 
Secretary Robert Gates, James Baker and Brent Scowcroft.  This team 
 
SIPDIS 
has some fundamental characteristics.  First of all they are 
conservative.  Second, they value stability above everything.  Last 
but not the least, they have no vision.  If the Bush administration 
adopts the style of this team, things in the Middle East will move 
toward even more chaotic terms and the democratization idea for the 
region will collapse.  I don't share the optimism emerging in the 
aftermath of the Congressional elections expecting a change in the 
American policy for Iraq and the Middle East.  In the next period to 
come, the US will continue to experience deep failure -- only in a 
different way." 
 
Veteran commentator Sami Kohen observes in the mainstream Milliyet 
that Turkey should keep in mind that the PKK problem cannot be 
solved in isolation; the issue is the stability of all of Iraq: 
"Although the Turkish public immediately thinks PKK when Iraq is 
mentioned, the developments in northern Iraq are in fact directly 
related to the future of all of Iraq.  Therefore controlling the PKK 
acts in northern Iraq and prevention of an independent Kurdish 
entity is very difficult in the absence of a nation-wide state 
authority and national unity in Iraq.  Given the circumstances in 
the country, the visit of the Iraqi Prime Minister to Ankara 
provided a very important chance to exchange views regarding Iraq's 
future and discuss possible contributions that Turkey can make.  Due 
to the grave security and stability concerns in Iraq as well as the 
helplessness of the US, it is hard to be optimistic regardless of 
official rhetoric, both in Washington and Baghdad, about the 
progress made so far on restructuring Iraq.  An immediate withdrawal 
of American forces before the Iraqi administration establishes full 
authority throughout the country can only accelerate chaos and civil 
war in Iraq.  For this reason, al-Maliki calls on the US and all 
neighbors of Iraq to help turn Iraqi forces into a genuinely 
powerful force.  Realizing this goal requires time and unfortunately 
time in Iraq works against peace and stability." 
 
Turkey Ousts France from Defense Fair

Hurriyet, Milliyet and others:  Following the actions of the Turkish 
military, the Turkish government has also reacted to France for the 
passage of a bill on the Armenian genocide isse.  During the 
introductory meeting of the Inernational Defense Industry Fair 
(IDEF), Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul announced that France would not 
be invited to the 8th IDEF in May 2007.  Following Gonul's comments, 
French Embassy Military Attach Jean Claude Gaey walked out of the 
meeting convened to discuss the fair. Meanwhile, the French Defense 
Ministry said the Turkish decision to suspend military ties with 
France is not considered a sign of crisis. 
 
US Helping to Cut off PKK Resources in Europe 
Star, Turkiye, Aksam, Zaman:  The US is working together with 
European officials to limit the PKK's financial resources in Europe. 
 A high-ranking US diplomat stated that the PKK receives money by 
exploiting the open society and freedoms in Europe to smuggle drugs 
and people, along with other organized crime activities, while 
engaging in money laundering using its different connections in 
various countries.  The money is used to purchase weapons and 
equipment for PKK terrorists.  The diplomat stressed that the US 
recently conveyed information obtained on PKK activities in Europe 
to the relevant European officials. 
 
Olli Rehn Comments on Cyprus 
Milliyet, Cumhuriyet, and others:  Speaking at the European 
Parliament, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said that it is 
the UN's responsibility, not the EU's, to resolve the issue in Maras 
(Varosa).  Rehn reiterated his full support for the Finnish plan.
