Foreign Affairs Youssouf Bakayoko on July 20.  The Minister 
had recently returned from attending the Non-Aligned Movement

reassuring to see the U.S. and Russia making an effort to 
resolve their difference and cooperate more closely. Minister

with Russia regarding Afghanistan, specifically Russian views 
towards al-Qaeda, and also wanted more data on U.S. and 
Russian views regarding Iran's nuclear program. Ambassador

made by Presidents Obama and Medvedev and to forward 
additional information, particularly recent USG statements 
about Iran's nuclear program.
