MOVING FORWARD 
 
REF: 09STATE68969 
 
¶1. Post appreciates the Department's commitment to 
consolidating the Knowledge Management (KM) needs of Mission 
Afghanistan. We are prepared to move forward and implement 
the solution (reftel) with your continued assistance. We are 
working closely and collegially with our USAID team in 
Afghanistan to meet AID business requirements on OpenNet, and 
we assume that M and D will ensure that USAID HQ will be 
fully cooperative - particularly during our three month pilot 
that begins in early August with 15-20 USAID users. 
 
¶2. Post confirms your recap of Mission KM priorities in 
REFTEL para 2: easy access to information on Mission-wide 
activities by region, elections information, and improved 
visibility of PRT reporting. We look forward to the 
assignment of three KM specialists. 
 
¶3. The success of these KM initiatives depend on your 
continued support. We look forward to improved 
communications here in Afghanistan and a possible template 
for other missions around the world.
