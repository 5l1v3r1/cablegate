In Today's Papers 
 
Erdogan Vows to Quit Politics if Not Returned to Power 
All papers:  Addressing people at an AKP rally in Isparta, PM 
Erdogan said that he would quit politics if his party does not 
receive enough votes to form a single party government.  He 
challenged CHP leader Deniz Baykal and MHP leader Devlet Bahceli to 
do the same.  Bahceli, campaigning in Iskenderun, responded to 
Erdogan's remarks saying "Erdogan has realized that his time in 
politics is over; his statement was not a challenge but rather an 
acceptance of one's own political death."  Mainstream Sabah reports 
that Baykal responded by saying "good-bye" to Erdogan.  Answering 
questions on NTV, DP leader Agar criticized Erdogan's statement and 
said "one should accept remaining in opposition as well as coming to 
power." 
 
Meanwhile, Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports an AKP-sponsored 
survey by Pollmark shows that AKP will get 42 percent, CHP 22 
percent, MHP 12 percent, and independents 24 percent  of the votes 
in the general elections. 
 
Tension Increases over Turkey-Iran Gas Deal 
Yeni Safak, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Zaman, Cumhuriyet and others: 
Controversy continues regarding the gas deal between Turkey and 
Iran.  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports that although the US 
reminded Turkey that the agreement violates the UN sanctions against 
Iran, PM Erdogan and FM Gul supported the deal, saying 'Turkey is 
not doing anything wrong."   Meanwhile, the undersecretary for 
economic and commercial affairs at the Iranian Embassy in Ankara, 
Ahmad Noorani said at a press conference that the "people in the 
region are entitled to make decisions about the future of the 
region." 
 
Sami Kohen writes in the mainstream Milliyet: "Changing 
circumstances create an impact on changing government policies. 
Turkey used to place more importance on countries other than Iran 
but the recent gas agreement wfQX3
