SUBJECT: BRAZIL:  NO OBJECTION TO HRSA/HHS AGREEMENT BETWEEN 
NATIONAL MARROW DONOR PROGRAM (NMDP) AND REDOME (BRAZILIAN VOLUNTEER 
BONE MARROW DONOR REGISTRY) 
 
REF: A) STATE 9732 B) BRASILIA 209 
 
¶1.  Embassy Brasilia has no objection to the proposed agreement 
between the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) and REDOME 
(Brazilian Volunteer Bone Marrow Donor Registry.) 
 
¶2.  The Embassy would like to stress that this agreement should not 
be seen as authorizing the transfer of genetic resources or 
information about genetic resources (other than that needed to 
accomplish the matching of volunteers and recipients and subsequent 
transplants).  If research on Brazilian genetic resources (apart 
from matching and transplanting purposes), then prior authorization 
should be obtained in accordance with applicable Brazilian laws, 
regulations and guidelines.  There are significant sensitivities 
surrounding the transfer of Brazilian genetic resources. 
 
¶3.  Any questions or concerns about this issue can be directed to 
the Embassy's Environment, Science & Technology, and Health (ESTH) 
Section, attention ESTH Officer Jeremy Long - LongJW@state.gov - 
Tel. (55)(61) 3312-7675.
