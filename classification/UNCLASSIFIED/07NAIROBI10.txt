¶1.  Ambassador Ranneberger was presented the following letter 
today.  The letter is dated December 30, 2006 
 
Text of letter: 
 
Mr. President, 
I am writing to communicate with you the situation in Somalia 
in the light of the recent developments that, in my view 
present a better opportunity to achieve a lasting peace in 
Somalia.  With opportunity however come challenges.  We have 
tried our best to tackle the issues that face Somalia in the 
best way we know how.  In our view, we feel Somalia have been 
neglected by the international community for so long. 
 
On the other hand, the troubles of our nation have been our 
fault and we are not blaming anybody.  As a result 
progressive nations have to excuse us of what we have done to 
our people and to our country in past.  We came thus far and 
we would want to move on and do good without dwelling into 
our gruesome past. 
 
The Transitional Government of Somalia would want to reach 
out to all sections of the Somali society and become more 
inclusive.  We can go the extra mile and include the 
government with the moderates and with the most respected 
elements of the society.  We are even ready to embrace those 
moderate members of the Islamic Courts Union who renounce 
violence although they are routed and disbanded. 
 
In the same vein we would like the international community to 
be more forthcoming in assisting Somalia in its quest for 
peace and good governance.  Areas of our priorities and needs 
include: 
¶1.  Giving your assistance and support in the deployment of 
the African mission, the IGAD Peace Support Mission to 
Somalia (IGASOM).  The Expedited Deployment would help us 
pacify and enhance security in Somalia. 
¶2.  The Transitional Federal Government urgently wants to 
implement and national security plan as envisioned in the 
National Security and Stabilization Plan (NSSP), which is 
endorsed by the Parliament and whose basis the IGASOM was 
authorized by the UNSC.  However, without the help of the 
international community the plan would not be implemented. 
This is another area of priority without which the country 
would not be stabilized any time soon. 
¶3.  For the government's institutions to function the TFG 
needs serious programmes of capacity building.  Financial, 
technical and material assistance are needed in this regard. 
 
As outlined above, there is a real chance to find a political 
solution to Somalia and a real opportunity for the 
international community to assist the government's efforts in 
the stabilization of the country. 
 
I would kindly entreat you not to fail Somalia in this 
critical period of our history. 
 
Please accept my kindest regards and esteem. 
 
      /S/ 
Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed 
President of Somalia
