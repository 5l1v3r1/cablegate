REF: SECSTATE 184972 
 
 1) The number of street children, particularly in Abidjan, 
is difficult to quantify.  Past Human Rights Reports (see 
2005) have placed that number at 50,000 in Abidjan alone. 
Subsequent reporting by observers in the NGO community 
monitoring this situation have revised the figure (see draft 
2006 Human Rights Report). 
 
2) UNICEF reports that, as of 2004, some 15% of the 
population lives on $1 per day or less. 
 
3) Recent reporting from UN Operations in Cote d'Ivoire and 
international NGOs indicates that reports of forcible 
conscription of children into the ranks of either the armed 
forces, the Forces Nouvelles or irregular militias have 
diminished substantially since the current crisis began in 
September 2002.  While reports of sexual abuse of women and 
girls by the Forces Nouvelles persist (along with similar 
allegations related to the government's armed forces), 
abductions related to this practice have not been reported in 
the past year.  There have been no recent reports of Liberian 
children being recruited in either Liberia or Liberian 
refugee camps to serve in either the government's or Forces 
Nouvelles armed forces (see draft 2006 Human Rights Report) 
 
4)  National examinations covering the 2005 academic year for 
students in the northern, Forces Nouvelles-held territory 
were held in February 2006, and examinations for the 2006 
academic year were held nationwide in September 2006 (see 
draft 2006 Human Rights Report). 
 
5)  In 2005, net primary school enrollment was 56 percent, 
according to UNICEF.  In 2005, 94% of children who started 
primary school reached grade 5, according to the same source. 
 
6)  The Ministry of Labor's Focal Unit on child labor no 
longer appears to have primary jurisdiction over the 
sensitive issue of child labor in the cocoa production 
sector.  The government cooperates closely with Germany's GTZ 
in establishing field committees to monitor and prevent child 
labor on cocoa farms.  GTZ estimates its sensitization and 
education program, which contains a substantial child labor 
component, currently reaches 50% of Cote d'Ivoire's cocoa 
production region. 
 
4)  The Prime Minister's Task Force on Child Labor in the 
Cocoa Sector was disbanded in June of 2006, but has been 
reconstituted.  It, along with the Ministry of Labor are 
currently coordinating the country's plan to address the need 
to implement a credible child labor monitoring system by 
Â¶2008.
