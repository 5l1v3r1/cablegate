SUBJECT: CARGO SHIP COLLIDES WITH FERRY NEAR SUEZ; 2 
KILLED, 40 INJURED 
 
 
¶1. (U) Two passengers were killed and another 40 injured when 
a Cypriot cargo vessel struck an Egyptian passenger ship, the 
Pride of Al Salam 95, near Port Tawfik at the southern 
entrance of the Suez Canal.  The Pride of Al Salam 95 was 
carrying over 1,300 Egyptian Muslim pilgrims returning from 
the port of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.  The collision did not/not 
prompt closure of the canal or disrupt shipping. 
 
¶2. (U) Initial reports indicate that the casualties on the 
Egyptian ferry resulted from a stampede of passengers trying 
to abandon the damaged ship.  The collision created a large 
hole in the engine room area of the ship, and the ship sank 
approximately three hours later.  At least 12 rescue boats 
were involved in rescuing passengers. 
 
¶3. (U) The Norwegian-built ferry was constructed in 1972, 
eventually being purchased by Egyptian owners in 1996 to 
service the Suez-Jeddah route.  A photograph of the ferry may 
be viewed at:
