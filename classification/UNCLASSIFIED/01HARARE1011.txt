REF: HARARE 829 
 
¶1.  THE AREAS MOST AFFECTED BY LOCAL FLOODING ARE IN THE 
ZAMBEZI RIVER VALLEY IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE 
MASHONALAND CENTRAL PROVINCE.  THIS AREA INCLUDES KADOMA 
AND MUZARABAHANI.  IN ADDITION MUCH OF THE LOW-LYING, 
SOUTHERN AREAS OF ZIMBABWE ARE NOW EXPERIENCING WATER- 
LOGGING OF THE SOIL IN ADDITION TO RIVER AND RUNOFF DAMAGE 
(NOTABLY OF ROAD TRAFFIC AND FOOT CROSSINGS), AND IF HEAVY 
RAINS CONTINUE MORE WIDESPREAD FLOODING WILL SPREAD TO 
THESE REGIONS.  ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE 
(GOZ) CIVIL PROTECTION DEPARTMENT (CPD) WEEKLY REPORT OF 
MARCH 9, THE AFFECTED AREAS ARE: 
 
=  MASHONALAND CENTRAL:  MUZARABANI DISTRICT:  THERE HAS 
BEEN EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO CROPS, WITH MANY CROPS SUBMERGED 
OR WASHED AWAY.  LIVESTOCK, GRANARIES, ROADS AND A NUMBER 
BRIDGES HAVE BEEN WASHED AWAY.  5700 FAMILIES HAD TO BE 
TRANSPORTED OUT OF THE FLOOD ZONE BECAUSE THEIR HOMES WERE 
DESTROYED OR INUNDATED.  THE AIR FORCE OF ZIMBABWE IS 
CURRENTLY HELPING TO TRANSPORT FOOD TO THE FLOOD ZONE.  THE 
COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION (CFU) HAS DONATED MAIZE MEAL AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  01011  141034Z 
AGREED TO PROVIDE TRUCKS TO TRANSPORT FOOD AND SUPPLIES 
FROM NGOS OR THE GOZ, AND SAVE THE CHILDREN (UK) HAS 
PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL SIMILAR ASSISTANCE TO THE AFFECTED 
AREAS AS WELL. 
 
=  MASHONALAND WEST: NUMEROUS AREAS IN THIS PROVINCE ARE 
NOW INACCESSIBLE BECAUSE ROADS AND BRIDGES ARE DAMAGED OR 
IMPASSABLE.  THE MUPFURE RIVER HAS OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS. 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MADE HOMELESS AND DAMAGE TO CROPS AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT YET KNOWN. 
 
=  MIDLANDS PROVINCE: NUMEROUS AREAS IN THIS PROVINCE ARE 
NOW INACCESSIBLE BECAUSE ROADS AND BRIDGES ARE IMPASSABLE. 
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MADE HOMELESS AND DAMAGE TO CROPS AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT YET KNOWN. 
 
=  MATEBELELAND NORTH PROVINCE: IN THE TSHOLOTSHO DISTRICT 
THE GWAAI RIVER HAS OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS, WASHING AWAY 
HOMES AND HUTS.  OVER 100 VILLAGERS HAD TO BE TAKEN TO THE 
LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR TEMPORARY SHELTER.  THE AIR FORCE OF 
ZIMBABWE IS CARRYING OUT RESCUE OPERATIONS, AND IT IS 
ESTIMATED THAT AT LEAST 5000 PEOPLE WILL BE AFFECTED OR 
NEED ASSISTANCE WHEN OPERATIONS ARE COMPLETED. 
 
¶2.  THE CONTINUOUS WET WEATHER AND INCESSANT RAINS IN 
ZIMBABWE HAVE PARTICULARLY NEGATIVELY AFFECTED CROPS IN 
MASHONALAND EAST, MASHONALAND CENTRAL, MASVINGO AND 
MANICALAND PROVINCES.   ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT OF 
ZIMBABWE (GOZ) AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL AND EXTENSION 
SERVICES (AGRITEX) REPORT, THE CONSTANT RAINS ARE CAUSING 
WATER-LOGGING AND NITROGEN LEACHING IN MOST AREAS AND HAVE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  01011  141034Z 
RESULTED IN NITROGEN DEFICIENCY IN THE FLUE-CURED TOBACCO 
CROP AND MUCH OF THE MAIZE CROP, WHICH COULD REDUCE YIELD 
AND QUALITY.  BURLEY TOBACCO YIELDS IN MASHONALAND CENTRAL 
MAY BE REDUCED DUE TO EARLY RIPENING FROM THE RECENT HEAVY 
RAINS. 
 
¶3.  THE COTTON HARVEST MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BECAUSE 
MOST AREAS THAT PRODUCE COTTON HAVE SUFFERED THE PROBLEMS 
OF BOLL DROP AND BOLL ROT DUE WATER-LOGGING OF COTTON PLANT 
ROOTS. 
 
¶4.  ACCORDING TO THE GOZ CIVIL PROTECTION DIVISION (CPD), 
ALL COMMITTEES AT DISTRICT LEVEL HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED TO 
MONITOR AND RESPOND TO THE CURRENT FLOOD EMERGENCY.  WE 
WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE WEEKLY STATUS REPORTS FROM 
CPD, AGRITEX, FEWS/SADC AND OTHER SOURCES FOR INFORMATION 
ON FLOOD CONDITIONS AND DAMAGE IN ZIMBABWE.
