SUBJECT: INDONESIA NOT READY TO SIGN IRENA AGREEMENT AT THE EGYPT 
CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 59969 
 
¶1. Dadan Kusdiana, Head of Energy for Rural or Suburban Areas at the 
Directorate General of Electricity, in the Ministry of Energy and 
Mineral Resources, told Embassy on June 15 that Indonesia has not 
yet made a decision regarding joining the International Renewable 
Energy Agency (IRENA) and was unlikely to do so by the June 28th 
preparatory conference in Egypt.  Kusdiana was pleased that the 
United States is seriously considering joining IRENA, and he sees 
potential benefit in the organization, but cautioned that Indonesia 
is not ready to make a commitment. 
 
¶2. Key Indonesian stakeholders are conducting internal discussions 
on IRENA, and Kusdiana highlighted that there are internal 
supporters of IRENA membership.  Ultimately, the Minister of Energy 
and Mineral Resources will make the decision whether to join IRENA, 
but Kusdiana's chain of command will not be ready to present this 
option to the Minister in the near future. 
 
¶3. The Indonesian government seeks assurance before it joins that 
IRENA will benefit Indonesia, and not merely serve as a market for 
developed countries' technologies, according to Kusdiana, although 
he did identify specific Indonesian objectives.  He was receptive to 
the idea of capacity building in the renewable energy sector. 
 
¶4. The government of the UAE has formally advocated with the 
Indonesian government regarding its proposal to host the IRENA 
headquarters.  Kusdiana cautioned that the Indonesians will not 
support a headquarters proposal before they have made a formal 
decision on membership.
