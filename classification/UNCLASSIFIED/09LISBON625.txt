¶1. Between December 7 and December 13 Portugal diagnosed 14,518 new 
cases with flu symptoms.  One-hundred and thirty-three patients 
remain hospitalized, including twenty-five in intensive care.  There 
have been forty-six confirmed H1N1 fatalities to date.  The majority 
of the fatalities were males averaging 45.5 years old with other 
serious preexisting medical conditions. 
 
¶2. One month into the vaccination campaign Portuguese health 
authorities confirmed that 115,000 Portuguese have been vaccinated 
(out of a population of 11 million), including only 32 percent of 
doctors, 18 percent of nurses and 12 percent of other health 
professionals.  Dr. Filipe Froes, a respected pulmonologist, told us 
that the Portuguese government goal to vaccinate 30 percent of the 
population will not be achieved due to public reluctance to be 
immunized. 
 
 
¶3. The Portugal National Authority of Medicines and Health Products 
has received 90 notifications of adverse reactions to the H1N1 
vaccine, of which 36 were considered serious.  The most commonly 
reported reactions were muscle and joint pain and fever, in adults 
31-40 years old. 
 
¶4. Deputy Health Director Graga Freitas confirmed that Portugal has 
administered 240,000 doses of vaccine and is distributing another 
71,000 doses.
