START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
In the Fall of 2004, Yolande James, a 27-year-old lawyer, 
became the first black woman to be elected to Quebec's 
provincial legislative assembly.  James is perfectly 
bilingual -- she has a B.A in civil law from the Universit 
de Montral and a B.A. in common law from Queen's University 
- and very politically-connected, despite her young age. 
Prior to her own election to Quebec's parliament, James put 
in time for two other legislators, as a political aid and as 
a press attach.  James has many other supporters in elite 
e 
Liberal Parti du Quebec circles: she has already been named 
to two standing committees (Social Affairs and Labor and the 
Economy) and has just taken on the role of Parliamentary 
Assistant to Quebec's Immigration and Cultural Communities 
Minister (a recent IV alum by the name of Lise Theriault). 
The population of James' political district, Nelligan, is 35 
percent anglophone, and 23 percent allophone (neither French 
nor English as mother tongue) - both linguistic groups from 
which the Liberal Party of Quebec can count on votes.  James 
is acutely interested in the issues of minority and 
immigrant integration in Quebec; she has expressed interest 
in gaining exposure to the way that minorities and 
immigrants are drawn into the U.S. political and economic 
systems - as well as the successes and challenges that 
American racial and religious minorities have faced and 
continue to experience. She is also eager to understand U.S. 
immigration policies better.  James is also very interested 
in the U.S.-Canada relationship: a member of the Quebec 
provincial legislature's Delegation on Relations with the 
United States, James knows that given U.S.-Canadian economic 
interdependence, it behooves her to know more about how our 
two countries exist side by side, and work together.  Her 
district is host to a large number of high-tech corporations 
whose survival depends on their ability to compete in a 
globalized economy.  James would like to hear American 
perspectives on outsourcing, industrial promotion and 
subsidy, and possible NAFTA expansion.  Finally, she would 
like to see how American politicians and policymakers are 
dealing with issues that are high priorities for Quebec 
voters:  delivery of social services and healthcare, 
education improvement, and aid to working parents.
