SUBJECT: FRENCH BIOTECH POLICY MEASURES BOGGED DOWN 
 
¶1.  Summary: A working group formed by the French Ministry of 
Agriculture will meet in February to provide recommendations on 
coexistence rules.  In view of the fact that both the working group 
and the High Biotech Committee will include representation from 
environmental NGOs and other stakeholders in addition to scientists, 
political considerations will influence the outcome. The High 
Biotech Committee, created by decree on December 7, will use the 
conclusions of this working group to formalize recommendations on 
coexistence to the French Government.  The High Biotech Committee is 
not yet operational, as French authorities have not been able to 
compromise on a president for this authority. End Summary. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶2.  A national environmental review in 2007 (ref A) (which resulted 
in the dissolution of the previous, science-based competent 
authority) and an EU threat to impose significant fines for failure 
to implement EU Directive 2001/18 on the release of GE products in 
the environment in a timely manner, prompted France to pass a 
biotech bill in June 2008 (ref B). 
 
¶3.  This legislation called for a new biotech authority (High 
Biotech Committee) whose mission, as defined in the biotech bill, is 
to provide advice to the French Government on a wide range of issues 
relative to biotech products.  More specifically, its purview 
includes responsibility for proposing a definition for non-biotech 
products; recommending coexistence measures for biotech and 
non-biotech crop cultivation; and reviewing applications on the 
confined use of GE products and on the release into the environment 
(cultivation) of a large number of GE products. 
 
¶4.  The new authority was created by decree on December 7, 2008 (ref 
C).  Recently, the Government's announced candidate for the 
Committee's presidency was rejected by the Economic committees of 
the National Assembly and the Senate, an indication of the 
position's sensitivity.  Members will serve five-year terms and will 
be nominated by decree published in the French Official Journal. 
 
Working Group on Biotech and Non-Biotech Coexistence 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶5.  Despite the fact that the Ministries of Agriculture and 
Environment have administrative authority to adopt coexistence 
measures, they decided to establish a working group to propose 
measures for consideration to the High Biotech Committee 
(composition of the working group is detailed below.)  This decision 
was reportedly made after figures on cropping distances appeared in 
the press and stakeholders demanded input.  The working group 
composition is to reflect participation in the 2007 national 
environmental consultation, which subsequently led to the 2008 
freeze on MON810 cultivation in France.  The group will include 
scientific researchers, farmer representatives, environmental NGOs, 
the agri-food industry and local authorities.  The working group is 
expected to meet in February 2009 but further details are not 
currently available. 
 
¶6. Comment:  The composition of the Committee and the working group 
on coexistence all but ensure a political outcome to deliberations. 
Due to the fact that the High Biotech Committee has not yet been 
formed, resumption of commercial production of GE crops is not 
expected before 2010.  The viability of any future commercial 
production will be heavily influenced by the biotech crop 
coexistence measures adopted by the French Government on the basis 
of recommendations made by the working group and the High Biotech 
Committee.  Post is planning several outreach activities with a view 
toward encouraging a science-based approach to the coexistence 
issue.  The target audience includes: Parliamentarians (in 
cooperation with a pro-biotech Senator), regulators, scientists, and 
selected journalists.  Speakers will include a State/EEB-funded 
biotech outreach speaker, the president of France's previous biotech 
authority, who recently visited the United States, and possibly 
regulators from other European countries with viable coexistence 
programs. End Comment.
