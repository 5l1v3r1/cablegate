¶1. SUMMARY. On Monday, June 15, officials from USG and the 
semi-autonomous Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) held their first 
Partnership Conference.  This conference brought together 
representatives from USAID and the State Department based in Juba, 
Khartoum and Washington, along with more than 30 GOSS Ministers, 
Commissioners, Undersecretaries and other representatives.  The two 
parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to reinforce 
their partnership and to reconfirm the $203 million in funding that 
is part of an overall Regional Assistance Grant Agreement (RAGA) 
signed between USAID and the GOSS in September 2008.  END SUMMARY.

¶2. In an effort to strengthen the already-positive USG and GOSS 
relationships and programs, USAID organized a Partnership Conference 
with key GOSS government officials on June 15.  The theme of the 
event was "Working Together Toward Sustaining Peace and Stability." 
The session was led by GOSS Minister of Regional Cooperation General 
Oyay Deng Ajak, the Acting Assistant Administrator of USAID's Africa 
Bureau, USAID's Mission Director for Sudan and the Acting U.S. 
Consul General Juba. 
¶3. The MOU signed by the GOSS and USAID declared as a common goal 
working together to strengthen democracy, economic prosperity, and 
regional stability for southern Sudan.  The MOU recognizes U.S. 
support for GOSS priority development sectors that expand employment 
and improve sustainable livelihoods; increase access to healthcare 
including HIV/AIDS and malaria treatment and prevention; expand 
access to education with a focus on gender equality; and further the 
rule of law and good governance while preparing for the national 
elections in 2010.  The signing ceremony was covered extensively by 
local media. 
¶4. Through the RAGA signed in September 2008, USAID has contributed 
more than $203 million for development programs with the intention 
of helping the GOSS provide the tangible peace dividends promised to 
its citizens in the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). 
Additional funding may be added to this agreement from 2009 to 2012. 
 Over the past nine months, several sub-sector retreats have been 
held with GOSS Ministries and State Governments, focusing on 
democracy and governance, health, education, and on the Three Areas 
of Abyei, Southern Kordofan, and Blue Nile States. 
¶5. Minister for Presidential Affairs Luka Biong Deng spoke about the 
opportunities and challenges related to the CPA, outlined the 
various implementation issues on which the NCP and SPLM have 
disagreed since 2005, and expressed his government's hope that the 
upcoming CPA Forum in Washington on June 23 will lead to positive 
progress.  Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Samson Kwaje 
clarified current objectives and goals and outlined GOSS priorities, 
including education, prosperity, democracy, safety and security, 
tolerance, freedom and peace. 
¶6. USAID staff outlined USG commitments to Southern Sudan and 
highlighted current programs and accomplishments.  The GOSS 
appreciated the information related to future plans in economic 
growth, education, health, democracy and governance, and police 
training and corrections facilities improvement (managed by 
State/INL), support to the Three Areas, and humanitarian assistance. 
 It was emphasized that USAID's strategy and USG programs are 
directly aligned with the GOSS priority areas.

A FRANK AND CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE USG AND GOSS

¶7. A substantial amount of time was devoted to questions and 
comments from the GOSS officials.  Regarding economic growth issues, 
agricultural development is a top priority, with market access 
including road construction, farmer training, seed distribution, 
improved productivity highlighted.  Concerning education, officials 
raised points on improving literacy, expanding teacher training, 
continuing construction of new schools, facilitating more school 
feeding programs, and assisting with "mother tongue" instruction. 
Several GOSS officials addressed democratic governance, given the 
urgency related to the upcoming national election, currently 
scheduled for February 2010, and the referendum on 
self-determination for southern Sudan, likely to take place in early 
¶2011.  GOSS official praised health activities, and the head of the 
HIV/AIDS Commission requested support for an AIDS Prevalence Survey. 
 The BRIDGE program -- which is a multi-sectoral activity 
concentrating on states along the North/South border, including 
Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap, Unity, Upper Nile and the Three 
Areas of Abyei, Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile -- helps to improve 
the relationship between local government and war-weary communities. 
 GOSS officials were pleased to hear that humanitarian assistance is 
beginning to transition from relief to development programs.

Several speakers applauded USAID efforts to build the capacity of 
the GOSS Ministries and public service delivery. 
¶8. USAID officers highlighted their programs' approach to gender 
mainstreaming in its activities.  This point was noted positively by 
the GOSS Chairperson of the Anti-Corruption Commission.  She added 
that while the majority of USAID staff in Juba is female, only 
herself and one other woman were present at the conference to help 
represent the GOSS. 
 
¶9. The Acting Consul General reinforced the message that the GOSS 
needs to address corruption in a more diligent manner.  In response, 
a GOSS official cautioned her colleagues that additional donor funds 
should not be provided directly to the GOSS before the latter puts 
proper financial and procurement systems in place to demonstrate 
fiscal discipline and effective management.

NEXT STEPS

¶10. GOSS and USG officials agreed on the need for future meetings to 
update each other on progress being made across different sectors. 
The impressive attendance and high-level GOSS representation 
demonstrated an active interest in USG-funded programs and the 
genuine partnership between the two sides.  Given that several 
participants from the conference will be attending the June 23 CPA 
Forum in Washington, this event was a positive reaffirmation of the 
USG's commitment to supporting the GOSS.
