SUBJECT: PORTUGAL'S RESPONSE ON IAEA REPORT ON UNSCR 1737 
COMPLIANCE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 23001 
 
Pol-Econ Off underscored our concerns about Iran's continued 
unwillingness to comply with UNSCR 1737 in a meeting with MFA 
Disarmament and Security Officer Filipe Ramalheira.  In 
response to the reftel message points, Ramalheira agreed that 
the recent IAEA report confirmed Iran's disregard for the 
Resolution terms and the UN's measures.  He stressed that 
Portugal was growing increasingly concerned by the impasse 
and fully supported continued efforts to find a diplomatic 
solution.  Portugal is also committed to the sanctions 
recently approved by EU Member States against Iran, which go 
beyond the 1737 provisions.
