¶1. Ag Counselor delivered reftel talking points to Selma 
Ayture at the External Relations Division at the Ministry of 
Agricultural and Rural Affairs (MARA) on Nov. 25.  She 
replied that they were aware of the initiative but said there 
had been no coordinated discussion within the ministry.  She 
also noted that no other G-8 government had raised the issue 
with them and suggested that an official reaction would be 
hastened by delivering the talking points in an official 
letter to MARA Minister Eker.  Ag Counselor will prepare and 
deliver such a letter. 
 
¶2. We scheduled an appointment on Nov. 25 to meet with the 
MFA Office of Multilateral Economic Affairs on the GPAF 
proposal, but the responsible MFA interlocutor missed the 
appointment due to illness.  Post will reschedule the meeting 
and report on any response either from MFA or MARA.
