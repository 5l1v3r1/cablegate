SURINAMESE OFFICIAL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 89911 
 
¶1.  EmbOff delivered message from reftel to Terence Craig, 
Head of the Americas Division of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Government of Suriname (GOS), on July 10. 
EmbOff also dropped off copies of a Reporters Without Borders 
article on the lack of internet freedom in Cuba for Craig and 
co-workers.  Craig and a colleague at the meeting expressed 
surprise that internet freedom was so restricted in Cuba, and 
appeared interested in reading the article. 
 
¶2.  Post attempted to place the Reporters Without Borders 
article with local newspapers and stir coverage of the issue, 
but no subsequent coverage ensued.  NOTE: Surinamese 
newspapers regularly print information which appears to stem 
from Cuban and Venezuelan outlets.  While they are receptive 
to covering U.S.-held events or assistance, they rarely place 
State Department-generated material.  END NOTE 
 
¶3.  Post will report any further reaction from the GOS.
