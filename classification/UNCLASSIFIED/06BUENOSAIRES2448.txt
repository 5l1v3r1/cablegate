SUBJECT: ARGENTINA TO SEEK BALANCED RESOLUTION ON THE 
SITUATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND CHILDREN IN LEBANON 
 
REF: A) STATE 176793 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Per reftel, Poloff delivered talking points and 
background paper to Manuel Fernandez Salorio, Minister in the 
Division of International Organizations in Argentina's 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Fernandez stated that the 
Argentine government (GOA) supports efforts to realize a 
lasting and definitive peace in the Middle East and is also 
committed to protecting the human rights of all children.  He 
acknowledged that the Cuba-sponsored resolutions does not 
take into account Hezbollah's aggressive actions nor the 
suffering of Israeli children and civilians. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  However, the GOA believes that Israel's use of 
force was "excessive and disproportionate" and consequently 
voted for the UN Human Rights Council resolution on the grave 
situation of human rights in Lebanon caused by Israeli 
military operations,  Fernandez explained.  He added that the 
GOA would likely try to introduce language to ensure the 
resolution had a more "balanced" perspective.  Fernandez 
declined to comment whether the GOA would vote against or 
abstain on the resolution, should those efforts fail, saying 
only that the GOA works by consensus.
