QUESTIONS ON ASSISTANCE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 30482 
 
¶1. (U) We conveyed to Indonesian counterparts on March 25 
reftel announcement of the appointment of the Special Envoy 
for MANPADS Threat Reduction.  We noted that the creation of 
this position underscored the importance that the United 
States attached to the effective control of such weapons.  It 
was particularly important to keep MANPADS out of the hands 
of terrorists.  We outlined the various types of assistance 
available, as described reftel. 
 
¶2. (U) Contacts in the Office of Disarmament and 
International Security at the Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DEPLU) thanked us for the information and the offer of 
assistance.  They said that Indonesia shared the USG view of 
the importance of effective national control of MANPADS in 
the context of the battle against terrorism.  Indonesia had 
national laws to regulate the possession of firearms and 
explosive bombs, including MANPADS, in the form of Law No. 
12/1951 and Law No. 2/2002. 
 
¶3. (U) They noted further that U.S. Transportation Security 
Authority (TSA) had offered Indonesia assistance in the form 
of a MANPADS Vulnerability Assessment (MVA) at Ngurah Rai 
Airport Bali.  Indonesia believed it possessed sufficient 
capacity to identify and assess the threat of the illegal use 
of MANPADS.  Indonesia was prepared to share this assessment 
with other interested countries.  That said, Indonesia 
remained open in principle to technical assistance and 
expertise, if needed, and in that regard would appreciate 
having more details of the outreach training under MANPADS 
Assist Visits (MAV). 
 
¶4. (U) Our DEPLU contacts also requested further 
clarification of what USG understood under reftel references 
to multilateral diplomatic initiatives to reduced MANPADS 
transfers and production technology proliferation, 
specifically:  multilateral efforts on export control and 
guidelines; bilateral consultations on specific exports; 
diplomatic interdictions activities; and sanction 
recommendations.  They noted that Indonesia had reservations 
regarding diplomatic interdiction activities and 
international sanctions as a matter of policy.  Mission will 
follow up directly with PM/WRA to obtain further details.
