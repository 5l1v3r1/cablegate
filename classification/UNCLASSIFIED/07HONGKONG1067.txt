1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted a post shipment- 
verification at FEI Hong Kong Company Limited, Room 
1508, Greenfield Tower, Concordia Plaza, 1 Science 
Museum Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong (FEI Hong Kong).  The 
item in question is an Edax Genesis XM4 System exported 
to FEI Hong Kong on or about March 4, 2007 and valued 
at USD 48,000.  On the applicable shippers export 
declaration (SED), the item is classified as 3A999. 
Items properly classified as 3A999 may be 
exported/reexported to virtually all destinations and 
end-users worldwide, license free except for certain 
designated state sponsors of terrorism (including North 
Korea).  The exporter was Edax, Inc. of Mahwah, New 
Jersey. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, FEI 
Hong Kong has been in existence since 1999.  Its paid- 
up share capital is the Hong Kong equivalent of 
approximately USD 200,000.  The Commercial Registry 
lists U.S. nationals John Doherty and Stephen Loughlin 
as directors.  FEI Hong Kong is an affiliate office of 
FEI Company headquartered in Hilsboro, Oregon.   (more 
information at www.fei.com). 
 
¶4.  On April 13, 2007, the ECO met with Ms. Susan Y.C. 
Chan, the FEI Hong Kong Sales and Service Coordinator 
as well as Raymond Wan, Warehouse Manager for Philips 
Electronics Hong Kong Ltd. and Mr. Tony Yiu, the Senior 
Manager for Transport and Storage.  Mr. Wan did most of 
the talking and first clarified that, until December of 
2006, Royal Philips Electronics (www.philips.com) 
("Philips") had held a significant stake in FEI 
Company.  While Philips had divested itself of its FEI 
Company stake, Philips Electronics Hong Kong Ltd. 
continues to provide logistic support services for FEI 
Hong Kong (including trade compliance services) on a 
contract basis. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Wan then provided a detailed review of the 
overall corporate-wide trade control procedures of 
Philips.  He spoke from slides he had prepared for a 
Hong Kong and Japanese joint conference on export 
controls held in 2006 in Hong Kong.  The overall 
Philips trade compliance program is quite impressive 
and this ECO now knows whom to call if he ever needs a 
private sector speaker in the area of export controls 
in Hong Kong. 
 
¶6.  As to the specific item in question, Mr. Wan and 
Ms. Chan provided the ECO with documentation indicating 
that the item had been received in Hong Kong and 
subsequently shipped to the end-user in Shanghai, 
namely the Shanghai Institute of Technology.  A 
subsequent e-mail from the salesman involved in the 
transaction revealed that the item will be used in the 
characterization and analysis of materials, including 
metals, ceramics, and polymers. 
 
¶7.  The ECO recommends that this check be categorized 
as Favorable.
