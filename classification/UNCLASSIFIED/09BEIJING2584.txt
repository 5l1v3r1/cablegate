  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  U.S. POLITICS 
 
"Obama's popularity plummets; is the Democratic Party repeating its 
defeat?" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(09/09): 
"Obama's healthcare reform plan has been in a very dangerous 
situation.  On the reform plan, considered to be the core content of 
a series of domestic policy reforms, Obama is losing supporters.  No 
president with a support rate lower than 40% can expect to 
successfully launch a healthcare reform plan with far-reaching 
influence.  The ups and downs of Obama's support rate clearly show 
the shift within independent voters without clear party 
inclinations.  A support rate below 50% shows that Obama's firm 
base, who last year voted him into office, is also wavering.  Obama, 
who played the public relations card to bolster his authority, is 
losing steam.  Regarding the coming congressional election and 
Obama's re-election in three years time, the Democrats are seriously 
concerned about the loss of these supporters.  Unless he can 
demonstrate a real ability to govern the country, it will be hard 
for the Democrats to avoid repeating Bill Clinton's (health care) 
'Waterloo' 15 years ago." 
 
¶2. U.S.-CHINA TIRE CASE 
 
"Better techniques needed to lobby the U.S." 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/09): "In order to cut or even prevent 
losses, China's tire exporters - in addition to needing the Rubber 
Industry Association's help - need to actively lobby the relevant 
parties in the U.S. to earn their support, especially when the U.S. 
has such an experienced hand in international trade cases.  China, 
as the country most accountable for the U.S. trade deficit along 
with Western countries' China stereotypes, will undoubtedly be 
involved in trade disputes now and in the future.  China should 
focus on improving its ability to repel these cases and use its 
lobbying skills to protect itself.  For the tire case, China should 
go to well-known, reputable and influential American importers.  In 
this way, when sanctions happen, China's 'stakeholders' will speak 
for China.  Chinese companies should also begin a public relations 
campaign speaking to ordinary American people about China's stance 
and their possible unemployment should sanctioning take effect. 
China needs to earn the support of ordinary American people.  What's 
more, China should be ready to compromise.  Long-lasting trade 
conflicts will harm both sides." 
 
¶3. CHINA-JAPAN RELATIONS 
 
"History between Chinese Communist Party and Democratic Party of 
Japan" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(09/09): "Wang 
Shaopu, Director of Japanese studies center at Shanghai Academy of 
Social Science, said that the Democratic Party of Japan has 
historically developed relations with the Chinese Communist Party 
because it absorbed a lot of left-wing party members.  However, some 
of its members, on some issues, work in extremes.  After the DPJ 
takes office, Sino-Japan relations will still be uncertain.  Wang 
Xinsheng, professor on Japan's history at Peking University, said 
that Ichiro Ozawa, the former DPJ president, advocated leading Japan 
to be a normalized country through a competitive two-party system. 
This meant getting away from U.S. control, being independent and 
able to issue Japan's own voice.  This is a good thing for China. 
Some experts worry that many DPJ politicians, including Yukio 
Hatoyama, are more supportive of a Western-style human rights 
concepts than Liberal Democratic Party politicians, which could be a 
future destabilizing factor in Sino-Japanese relations.  Mr. Wang 
believes that, though uncertainties exist, the DPJ will maintain 
relations with the CCP after it takes office."
