SUBJECT: PEACE CORPS SET TO RETURN 
 
Peace Corps and the Government of Indonesia reached agreement in 
principle today on a Memorandum of Understanding for the return of 
the Peace Corps to Indonesia.  Bringing Peace Corps back to 
Indonesia, after an absence of more than forty years, is an 
important part of the Comprehensive Partnership we are building with 
Indonesia.  While there are still a few procedural steps left - 
formal agreement on one remaining issue on the Indonesian side, 
legal review, and translation - Indonesia wants to sign this 
agreement in conjunction with the President's possible visit.  The 
entire Mission in Jakarta would like to thank the Peace Corps and 
everyone else in Washington who brought about this success.
