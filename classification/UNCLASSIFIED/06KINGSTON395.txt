¶2. (SBU) On February 24, P/ECouns met with and conveyed 
reftel points to Ambassador Vilma McNish, Director, Office of 
Multilateral Affairs, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Foreign Trade (MFAFT), leaving the points as a non-paper. 
 
¶3. (SBU) McNish said she hoped that "diplomacy is the ideal 
tool" to resolve the impasse with Tehran, noting that she was 
encouraged by the possibility of an agreement with Russia to 
process Iranian nuclear materials.  IAEA Director General El 
Baradei's report would be useful, she said, in clarifying 
what next steps might be appropriate.  McNish briefly 
mentioned what she described as Iran's "security needs" given 
Tehran's long-standing political disagreement with the USG 
and its concerns about the situation next door in Iraq. She 
hastened to add that she was not excusing Iran's NPT 
violations, only suggesting that any lasting resolution to 
the current crisis needed to take Tehran's legitimate 
concerns into account.
