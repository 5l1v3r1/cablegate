GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 128359 
 
¶1. The following are comments received from the Government of 
Zimbabwe's (GOZ) Ministry of Industry and International Trade 
on September 6, 2006 concerning the General System of 
Preferences (GSP) Review as they pertain to Zimbabwe in 
response to talking points delivered per reftel. 
 
¶2. "As you may be aware, Zimbabwe has not been exporting 
ferrosilicon to the American market for the past few years. 
This is basically because we have not been producing the 
product, in view of the fact that we could not export it 
competitively given the prevailing world market prices.  The 
cost of production, on the other hand, had also risen and we 
could not sustain it on the basis of the low international 
prices.  It is pleasing to note that there has since been an 
improvement in the price levels and the producers of 
ferrosilicon have once again decided to revisit exports of 
ferrosilicon. 
 
It is against this background that the Government of the 
United States of America is kindly requested to consider 
extending Zimbabwe's GSP eligibility for ferrosilicon into 
the next calendar year.  Exports of ferrosilicon would 
certainly contribute to economic growth in Zimbabwe and 
generate the much needed foreign exchange for sustainable 
economic development."  Signed, Mrs. Beatrice Mutetwa for 
Secretary for Industry and International Trade.
