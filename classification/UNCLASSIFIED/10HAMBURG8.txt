¶1.  (U) On February 19, 2010, Consul General Karen Johnson 
attended the 654th St. Matthew's Banquet at the Hamburg Rathaus, 
an event hosted by the city government since 1356.  This year's 
event, attended by 400 guests, commemorated the 1989 Peaceful 
Revolution.  Speakers included Hamburg's First Mayor Ole von 
Beust; Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's former Foreign 
Minister; Marianne Birthler, the Federal Commissioner of the 
Records of the Stasi Archives; and Prof. Dr. Laszlo Solyom, 
President of Hungary. 
 
¶2.  (U) In his keynote speech, President Dr. Solyom emphasized 
that Hungary has progressed significantly since the fall of 
communism.  According to Dr. Solyom, Hungary has established a 
respected Constitutional Court system and ensured  greater 
liberties, such as freedom of speech, for Hungarian citizens. 
The President also stated that Hungary has enacted environmental 
protection provisions that are stronger than the European 
average.  He concluded that his nation has earned the right to 
demand that its strengthened institutions be trusted by the 
international community. 
 
¶3. (U) Comment:  The St. Matthew's Banquet is a time-honored 
tradition which emphasizes Hamburg's long history as an 
economic, cultural, and political power.  This year's theme of 
honoring the Peaceful Revolution -- foreshadowing as it does the 
upcoming 20-year anniversary of German reunification -- has set 
the tone for a host of local commemorations of this historic 
period.  End comment. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Copies of all four speeches have been forwarded to the 
German and Hungarian desks.
