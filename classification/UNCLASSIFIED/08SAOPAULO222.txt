Brazil and the Food Crisis 
Op-ed by Brazilian Minister of Agrarian Development, Guilherme 
Cassel, in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (5/4) states: "Brazil is 
 
succeeding in the face of the commodities price crisis because of a 
powerful family-based agricultural sector which produces 70% of the 
food consumed by Brazilians.... Other countries that dismantled 
their regulatory policies and focused their agriculture only on 
external markets are suffering from shortages and inflation. But 
we're not completely immune to these facts. We must maintain the 
advances and avoid possible negative impacts such as lowering of the 
purchasing power of the poorer segments of the population, 
concentration of land and concentration of land in the hands of 
foreigners...and the prioritization of exports to the detriment of 
the domestic market. The long-term solution to ensure food security 
and stabilization of internal prices calls for several structural 
measures. It is necessary to guarantee a sufficient supply of food 
and that is done through strengthening family-based agriculture even 
more. It is also done through agrarian reform." 
 
Bolivian Tragedy 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (5/3) says: "The [Santa Cruz] 
separatist campaign...is a more than predictable answer to the 
political inability and the radical revenge tactic that stimulates 
[Evo] Morales' administration. Instead of moving towards national 
conciliation, the president chose, since taking office in 2006, to 
confront and divide. Just as separatist...is the Constitution 
approved without ample support in the country...and which awards 
special powers to the many Bolivian indigenous ethnicities...turning 
Bolivia into a sort of multiracial confederation. This entire 
freakish plan to promote revenge for 500 years of 'white' 
exploitation is based on economic assumptions and blatant 
stupidity....The president cannot subdue the people of Santa Cruz 
forcefully without running the dangerous risk of a civil 
confrontation.... If the Armed Forces are called to intervene on 
behalf of either side, we'll have the final chapter of the 
tragedy."
