 Â¶1.  On November 26, we delivered the requested demarche to 
Wael Abdoulmagd, Egypt's Deputy Foreign Minister for Human 
Rights.  Abdoulmagd was not aware of the upcoming election, 
but said he would consider the request for support and share 
it with his colleagues who coordinate United Nations 
activities.  We will report any substantive response 
separately.
