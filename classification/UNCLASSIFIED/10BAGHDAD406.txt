OVER HOUSING PROJECT 
 
¶1. (U)  This is a PRT Wasit reporting cable. 
¶2. (SBU)  SUMMARY:  The Wasit Provincial Government has 
declared its full commitment to supporting a large privately 
financed housing development project planned for al-Kut. 
This multi-year project will provide over eight-hundred 
apartments for middle income families. This project will put 
to the test the stated resolve of provincial institutions to 
facilitate private investment, even as it pushes the limits 
of essential services delivery in the area.  Governor Latif 
Hamad al-Turfah states that this project will set the 
benchmark that potential investors will use to gauge the 
viability of future large-scale privately-funded projects in 
Wasit.

¶3. (SBU)  An Iraqi company, Al-Hamra, has begun preliminary 
site work in al-Kut and construction drawings are in 
development.  At a Wasit Investment Commission (WIC) 
sponsored project meeting, Governor Turfah and influential 
Provincial Council Chairman Mahmud Abd al-Rida Talal 
encouraged cooperation between stakeholders and set the 
express expectation that provincial officials work as 
facilitators to the project and not, in the words of the 
Governor, as &impediments to investment.8  Al-Hamra 
representatives noted their intent to use local labor and 
materials whenever practical for the project and their 
engineering staff spoke in detail to municipal service 
managers regarding planned construction techniques, as well 
as the project,s significant electrical and water 
requirements. 
¶4. (SBU)  The Governor noted that while state-driven foreign 
investment such as the Chinese development of oil resources 
in Wasit were on-going, this type of privately executed 
project was critical for the future development of the 
province.  The Governor recognized the project,s positive 
impact on local job creation and dismissed queries related to 
the inclusion of a mosque in the project scope-of-work as 
irrelevant to the discussions.  Governor Turfah engaged in a 
public shouting match with a local reporter during the 
meeting, apparently upset over recent reporting critical of 
his performance and had the al-Sharqiyah Channel reporter and 
cameraman ejected from the meeting. 
¶5. (SBU)  Comment: Large scale private investment in Wasit 
remains theoretical at this time; the Wasit Investment 
Commission is very active but its effectiveness is difficult 
to gauge.  As the province moves towards more decentralized 
governmental functions, it might also gravitate towards 
increased private enterprise and entrepreneurship. Provincial 
government may have limited tools in which to facilitate 
investment, but as Governor Turfah stated, it can at the very 
least remove the bureaucratic roadblocks that suppress it. 
END COMMENT.
