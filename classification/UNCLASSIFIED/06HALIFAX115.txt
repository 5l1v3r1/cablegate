SUBJECT: NOVA SCOTIA'S NEW LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  Prime Minister Harper has named Mayann Francis to be 
the next Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, replacing Myra 
Freeman.  Francis has been since 1999 CEO of the province's 
Human Rights Commission, where she has developed a reputation as 
an effective manager and advocate for human rights.  She is a 
native of Sydney, Nova Scotia, and holds a master's degree in 
business administration from New York University.  She will be 
the first African-Nova Scotian to hold the largely ceremonial 
post as the Queen's representative in the province. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Francis is well-known to the Consulate.  She still 
maintains close ties to the U.S., generally traveling to New 
York to spend Thanksgiving with relatives.  We have found her to 
be very interested in bilateral exchanges; she has organized 
meetings on several occasions for our visiting Black History 
Month speakers, gathering professionals from Halifax with shared 
interests for informal conversations on a wide range of topics 
including race relations in both countries.  Following the 
President's visit to Halifax in December 2004 she wrote a 
positive newspaper column about her experience at his speech. 
Earlier this spring Francis collaborated with Valerie Payne, 
President of the Halifax Chamber of Commerce, to invite 
Secretary Rice to visit Halifax to speak to a Chamber audience.

¶3.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Myra Freeman's more than six years as a 
very active and visible Lt-Governor will be a hard act to 
follow, but if anyone can do it, Mayann Francis can.  Freeman 
was tireless in promoting the province's academic and arts 
sectors and opening up Government House to thousands of people 
from all walks of life.  Mayann Francis has impressed us with 
her intelligence, political savvy and energy, and we expect her 
to make full use of her new office to promote positive civic 
values such as academic excellence.   END COMMENT.
