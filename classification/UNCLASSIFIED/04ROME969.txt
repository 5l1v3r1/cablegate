REFTELS:  (A) ROME 638, (B) ROME 936 

¶1.  AS EXPECTED, THE ITALIAN CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES MARCH 10 
APPROVED EXTENDING UNTIL JUNE 30, 2004, FUNDING FOR ITALY'S 
PARTICIPATION IN ALL ITS MILITARY MISSIONS ABROAD, 
INCLUDING IRAQ (REF. B).  THE CHAMBER DID NOT MAKE ANY 
AMENDMENTS TO THE TEXT THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE SENATE ON 
FEBRUARY 18 (REF. A).  THE VOTE IS THEREFORE FINAL AND THE 
DECREE IS NOW LAW. 
 
¶2.  THE CENTER-RIGHT GOVERNING MAJORITY VOTED IN FAVOR (281 
AYES), WHILE THE CENTER-LEFT SPLIT IN THREE CHUNKS.  THE 
NAYS WERE 64, AND INCLUDED THE GREENS, COMMUNIST RENEWAL 
(RC), AND THE ITALIAN COMMUNISTS (PDCI), AS WELL AS 39 FROM 
THE LEADING OPPOSITION DEMOCRATS OF THE LEFT (DS) -- MORE 
THAN JUST THE DS' LEFT-WING "CORRENTONE" -- AND ONE FROM 
THE DAISY.  TWELVE CENTER-LEFT PARLIAMENTARIANS FROM 
MASTELLA'S UNION OF DEMOCRATS FOR EUROPE (UDEUR) AND FROM 
LOCAL AUTONOMY PARTIES ABSTAINED.  THE REST OF THE DS, 
TOGETHER WITH THE ITALIAN SOCIALISTS (SDI), AND THE BULK OF 
DAISY PARTY MEMBERS DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE VOTE. 
 
¶3.  AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SESSION CHAMBER PRESIDENT 
CASINI EXPRESSED THE CHAMBER'S HEART-FELT THANKS TO THE 
MILITARY DEPLOYED ABROAD AND THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY 
UNDERSCORED HIS WORDS WITH APPLAUSE.  THIS NOTWITHSTANDING, 
MOD UNDER SECRETARY CICU REGRETTED PARLIAMENT WAS NOT 
UNITED BEHIND THE TROOPS AND MOD MARTINO REMARKED THAT THE 
DIVISIONS WITHIN THE OPPOSITION AND ITS LACK OF SUPPORT FOR 
THE TROOPS WERE A "DARK PAGE" FOR ITALY'S DEMOCRACY. 
GREENS LEADER PECORARO SCANIO SAID INSTEAD THAT THE "DARK 
PAGE" WAS THE LACK OF UNITY WITHIN THE CENTER-LEFT.  GINO 
    STRADA, A PACIFIST ICON IN ITALY AND CHIEF OF THE NGO 
"EMERGENCY," COMMENTED THAT THOSE WHO DID NOT VOTE AGAINST 
WERE "POLITICAL DELINQUENTS," CAUSING DS LEADER FASSINO -- 
ALREADY IRRITATED BY HIS COALITIONS' DIVISIONS -- TO SEND 
HIM "TO HELL." 
 
¶4.  CPA BAGHDAD MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
