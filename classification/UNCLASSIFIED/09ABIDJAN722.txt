¶1.  (SBU)  November 29, the date scheduled for presidential 
elections in Cote d'Ivoire, came and went with little 
fanfare.  The GOCI made no official announcement on the 
postponed elections, leaving the November 11 statement (ref 
a) by Robert Mambe, the President of the Independent 
Electoral Commission (CEI), as the only official 
acknowledgment that the date had slipped.  The opposition 
PDCI held a demonstration November 29 encouraging Ivoirians 
to protest any further postponement.  Charles Ble Goude, 
President Gbagbo's national youth campaign director, also 
publicly expressed opposition to the delay, insisting that 
the CEI set a date within the next three months. 
 
NEW DATE NOT LIKELY TO BE ANNOUNCED SOON 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ambassador Alcide Djedje, Cote d'Ivoire's Permanent 
Representative to the United Nations and close presidential 
advisor, told Ambassador November 30 that he doubted a new 
date would be announced at the next meeting of the Permanent 
Concertation Framework (CPC), which will take place in 
Ouagadougou on December 3 (Gbagbo is departing Cote d'Ivoire 
on December 1).  Djedje said that the contestation period 
needed to unfold further before a definitive date could be 
determined.  He did not appear to be overly concerned by the 
prospect that the contestation period might go beyond the 
30-day limit, however. 
 
BUT SIGNS OF PROGRESS STILL VISIBLE 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  In another sign that obstacles to elections are 
being removed despite the fact that the election date was 
pushed back, President Gbagbo signed seven decrees on 
November 17, resolving most of the outstanding military 
issues that stymied the formation of joint brigades to 
provide security for the elections.  Alain Lobognon, a close 
advisor to Prime Minister Soro, told Ambassador that the 
decrees (official texts of which are not yet available) 
address the grades/ranks of the 400 former FDS soldiers who 
joined the rebellion in 2002; spell out the criteria for the 
5,000 FAFN who seek to join the new army; and clarify the 
post-crisis status of the 4,000 FAFN elements who join their 
FDS counterparts to form mixed brigades under the control of 
the ICC. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  The lack of strong public reaction to the 
failure to hold elections as scheduled is not surprising 
given that progress towards that end is being made.  As noted 
in ref b, the posting of the electoral list has given 
Ivoirians a sense of hope that the crisis really is nearing 
an end.  That, along with resolution of many of the key 
military issues, suggests that while there may still be bumps 
along the road, Cote d,Ivoire appears to be moving steadily 
towards elections.
