¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted a post shipment 
verification (PSV) at the Macau Security Forces 
Management Bureau, Calcada Dos Quarteis, Macau (Macau 
Security). The PSV concerned an infra-red thermal 
telescopic camera kit valued at $19,500 that was the 
subject of export license D352751 and which was 
exported to Macau Security in April 2006.  The camera 
kit is classified under ECCN 6A003 and is controlled 
for national security reasons (NS). 
 
¶3. On October 12, 2006, the ECO visited Macau Security 
at the address above and met with several 
representatives of Macau Security including 
Commissioner Sam Peng Chan, and Chief of the 
Procurement Division, Christine Poon. 
 
¶4.  Mr. Chan stated that the Special Duty Unit of the 
Macau Security Forces is using the item.  Mr. Chan 
further stated that the item is currently only being 
used for training purposes since it is a very 
specialized item.  He noted, however, that with 
increasing foreign investment and growth in Macau, 
Macau Security needed to be adequately prepared for all 
possibilities including terrorism or hostage 
situations. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Chan declined to allow the ECO to visit the 
location where the item is being kept, although he 
stressed that the item was under the specific control 
of the Special Duty Unit and for use only by that unit. 
 At the request of the ECO, two representatives of the 
Special Duty Unit produced the item for inspection by 
the ECO.  In addition, Mr. Chan's assistant provided 
documentation confirming import of the item into Macau 
as well as related procurement documents confirming the 
purchase of the item through procurement tender using 
trading company Artigos Electricos Tico (the purchaser 
referenced in reftel A). 
 
¶6.  Mr. Chan was well aware of the restrictions on use 
(law enforcement in Macau only) and/or reexport of the 
item. 
 
¶7.  It is worth noting that as a result of some initial 
confusion about the specific item that was the basis of 
the check, Macau Security produced a different item for 
review by the ECO.  That item was a Bullard thermal 
imaging camera (Bullard Tacsight S1)that had recently 
been received by Macau Security (August 25, 2006).  The 
ECO was provided with Bullard documentation indicating 
that Macau Security was aware of and agreed to 
restrictions on use and/or reexport of that item. OEA 
may wish to confirm that the Tacsight S1 was exported 
to Macau Security pursuant to a valid BIS license (the 
ECO suspects that is was). 
 
¶8. At the time visited, Macau Security appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the subject controlled item since 
it cooperated with the PSV and provided assurances 
reflecting appropriate controls over the item.  In 
addition, the consignee's activities are consistent 
with the use of the item ordered, and the consignee 
understands restrictions on use and/or reexport of the 
item.  The ECO recommends that this PLC be classified 
as Favorable.
