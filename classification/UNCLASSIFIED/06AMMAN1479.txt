¶1.  Summary: Senior management from the Trilateral 
Industrial Research and Development (TRIDE) Foundation met 
Jordanian and USG representatives in Amman on February 20 
for a strategic planning session.  The productive and upbeat 
meeting inaugurated the Ministry of Industry and Trade as 
the lead Jordanian partner in TRIDE.  Participants discussed 
TRIDE's $1 million budget, past projects, current proposals, 
and long-term goals.  A TRIDE Executive Committee meeting is 
tentatively scheduled for Jerusalem in March.  End summary. 
 
Next Meeting Scheduled For March 2006 in Jerusalem 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2.  This was the first TRIDE meeting since Jordan's $333,333 
contribution last December which completed the second 
tranche of TRIDE's financing to a total of one million 
dollars.  During the meeting, participants agreed to hold 
the next TRIDE meeting in March in Jerusalem. 
 
Ministry of Industry and Trade Now in Charge 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Operational management of TRIDE in Jordan is now firmly 
in the hands of the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT). 
Jordan's senior contact for TRIDE, MOIT Secretary General 
Montaser Oklah, said Jordan strongly supports TRIDE and said 
that TRIDE is now "home" at the MOIT, where it belongs. 
TRIDE was previously managed by the Ministry of Planning and 
International Cooperation.  Oklah said that Jordan sees 
great benefits from TRIDE, particularly in technology 
transfer, which Jordan badly needs. 
 
Pharmaceutical Project Looks Promising 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Dr. Eitan Yudilevich, Executive Director of TRIDE, 
presented background on TRIDE, and moved quickly to the 
current situation.  TRIDE has a $1 million budget, and has 
at least one excellent proposal in development.  The project 
would be between an Israeli, an American and a Jordanian 
firm for an R&D effort on production of antibiotics. 
Yudilevich likes the fact that each company has a clear and 
specific role in the project.  As currently structured, this 
proposal would require $900,000 from TRIDE, nearly all of 
TRIDE's budget.  Oklah said it was premature to make a 
decision on this particular project, and added that the 
financial sustainability of TRIDE is a key concern for 
Jordan.  He said that he doesn't want gaps in TRIDE's 
projects; he wants to see a smooth stream of projects, not 
an intermittent one here and there.  Oklah suggested, and 
Yudilevich agreed, that the upcoming TRIDE meeting would be 
the appropriate forum for further discussion. 
 
Jordan Wants Clear Guidelines and Fast Decisions 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5.  On the subject of proposal review and approval, Oklah 
said that clear, systematic evaluation guidelines and a 
streamlined process would help enable fast decision-making 
on project proposals.  Yudilevich said he would take that on 
as an action item.  Yudilevich also noted that the TRIDE 
Executive Committee has the ultimate authority in funding 
decisions, and that it operates by consensus.  Each member, 
he said, would in effect have a veto over any project 
proposal. 
 
TRIDE's Future - Seeking Deeper Pockets 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Yudilevich spent some time discussing the future of 
TRIDE, specifically its level of funding.  He advocated a 
larger endowment for TRIDE.  This financial cushion would 
smooth out the ups and downs of the current funding 
mechanism and help make TRIDE a success.  It would to enable 
TRIDE to "market" its services, to be able to commit to a 
steady stream of projects, to weather the inevitable 
failures, and to wait for the repayments that can be years 
away.  Yudilevich said he was under no illusions that this 
funding would be easy to obtain, and said he was open to new 
ideas. 
 
Jordan Rep Looks to Private Sector 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  Speaking frankly, Oklah said that supplying those kinds 
of funds will be "a problem" for the GoJ.  He recommended 
mobilizing private sector support, since business would be 
the primary beneficiary of TRIDE.  While acknowledging 
Oklah's suggestion, Yudilevich noted that there is always 
cost-sharing in TRIDE projects: according to TRIDE's rules, 
TRIDE will fund only up to 50% of the projected R&D costs of 
a project. 
 
TRIDE to Develop a "White Paper" To Make Case for Funding 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶8.  Oklah asked for supporting information and data on TRIDE 
to help him make a successful case to the Cabinet for 
additional funding for TRIDE.  He added that "results on the 
ground" would also be an important factor in persuading the 
Cabinet to provide additional funding.  Yudilevich said he 
would prepare a "White Paper" to make the case for 
additional funding.

¶10.  Comment:  There is genuine enthusiasm for TRIDE in 
Jordan.  Jordan is ready to engage and has a clear picture

be critical in making TRIDE an ongoing venture.
