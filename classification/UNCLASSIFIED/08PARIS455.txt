SUBJECT: NOMINATION OF ANTI-TIP HERO JEAN CLAUDE MBVOUMIN 
 
REF: 08 PARIS 358 
 
¶1.  (U) Post nominates Jean Claude Mbvoumin as a 2008 
anti-TIP hero.  Mr. Mbvoumin founded and runs the Soccer 
Culture Solidarity Association (Associate Culture Foot 
Solidaire (CFS)), which seeks to raise awareness and combat 
trafficking in young soccer players from Africa.  As a former 
soccer player recruited from Cameroon to play in France, Mr. 
Mbvoumin was moved to take action to combat this problem, 
which affects thousands of 12-18 year olds every year. 
Children throughout Africa are lured to Europe by corrupt 
recruiters that treat children as merchandise and fail to 
abide by immigration and labor laws.  Once in Europe, 
recruiters often pay children a small percentage of what was 
originally promised and abandon the children after they fail 
to make the cut for a soccer club or injure themselves during 
training. 
 
¶2. (U) Mr. Mbvoumin educates European leaders and potential 
recruits about the realities facing many child players that 
are recruited to Europe with promises of success and riches. 
CFS hosted an International Conference on Young Soccer 
players in 2006 and 2007 to warn potential victims of the 
realities of soccer recruiting.  Mr. Mbvoumin has testified 
in 2007 before the European Parliament to raise awareness of 
the issue and find solutions to the problem.  CFS has also 
worked with the Federation of International Soccer 
Associations (FIFA) to change recruiting laws to better 
protect minors.  With the help of the International 
Organization for Migration, CFS created a welcome booklet to 
be given to newly arrived soccer players.  The booklet 
explains labor laws and highlights social services that can 
help the young players.  Mr. Mbvoumin is a leader in fighting 
trafficking in soccer players; we commend his efforts, which 
have increased international awareness of the issue.
