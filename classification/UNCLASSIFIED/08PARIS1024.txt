REF: A. STATE 56560 (NOTAL) 
     Â¶B. PARIS 973 AND PREVIOUS 
 
We passed a copy of the draft agenda for the Friends of Iraq 
conference (ref A) to French MFA DAS-equivalent for 
Iran/Iraq/Arabian Peninsula Franck Gellet on May 28.  As 
noted in ref B, the GOF decided again not to attend the 
conference because of its association with the MNF-I 
coalition, of which France is not a member.  We explained 
that we were conveying the agenda for the GOF's information 
and to underscore that its intention was to move well beyond 
political and security matters in Iraq.  Gellet offered no 
response.
