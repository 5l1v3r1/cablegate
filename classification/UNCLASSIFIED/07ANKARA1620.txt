8th International Defense Industry Fair in Ankara

¶1. The 8th International Defense Industry Fair (IDEF - the biennial 
Turkish defense fair) was held on May 22-25 in Ankara.  494 
companies (333 foreign and 161 Turkish firms) from 48 countries 
participated in the fair, including 42 American companies.  Many 
high level officials from different countries attended, including 10 
defense ministers, 6 deputy defense ministers, 4 Chiefs of General 
Staff, and 7 defense undersecretaries.  Ceremonies to mark the 
signing of 13 contracts were held.  Turkish Defense Minister Vecdi 
Gonul met with official and unofficial visitors in an office 
dedicated to him in the fair area.  On May 22, a bomb explosion near 
the site of an IDEF reception hosted by Turkish CHOD GEN Buyukanit, 
which was attributed to the PKK terrorist organization, killed 8 and 
injured 100, including 6 Pakistani IDEF participants.  As a result, 
Turkish authorities increased security at the IDEF fairgrounds. 
 
Turkish General Staff Hosts International Symposium on Security 
--------------------------------------------- ---------

entitled 'New Dimensions of Security and International 
Organizations' at the War Academies in Istanbul on May 31-June 1.

800 participants from 55 countries.  GEN Buyukanit said in his 
remarks that he has already notified the government of the need to 
launch a cross-border operation into northern Iraq.  He also said 
countries providing logistical, financial and propaganda support to 
terrorists should be considered terrorists.  Defining proliferation 
as a potential threat, GEN Buyukanit noted that the weapons 
development activities of some countries threaten the region.  The 
changing roles of international organizations and their contribution 
to security policies; the role of the UN and NATO; and nuclear, 
biological and chemical weapons counter-measures were among other 
issues discussed in the symposium (ANA).

decision will affect around half a million people considering 
families of the military personnel, as reported by the Center-right
