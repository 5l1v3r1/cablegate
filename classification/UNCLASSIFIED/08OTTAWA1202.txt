REF: COOK-MATTEI E-MAIL OF 4/24/08 
 
¶1.  (U) Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
(DFAIT) Deputy Director for Continental Defense Relations 
Victor Rakmil told pol/miloff on September 12 that the 
Government of Canada had received approval from Parliament to 
bring into force the Agreement on Integrated Lines of 
Communication to Ensure Logistic Support for the Canadian 
Armed Forces and the Armed Forces of the United States, or 
the "ILOC."  Previous U.S. approval of the ILOC meant that it 
had come into force when the Embassy received DFAIT's dipnote 
response (in para 2 below) on September 5, Rakmil said. 
Embassy Ottawa will send a certified copy of its April 24, 
2008 dipnote and the original version of the Canadian dipnote 
response to State L/T on September 15. 
. 
¶2.  (U) Text of Canadian Dipnote:

presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States 
of America and has the honour to refer to the letter dated

the Government of Canada and the Government of the United 
States of America relating to the Establishment of Integrated 
Lines of Communications to Ensure Logistic Support for the 
Canadian Armed Forces and the Armed forces of the United 
States of America, done at Washington on 23 April 2008. 
 
The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is 
pleased to welcome the confirmation that the Government of 
the United States of America has completed the internal
