In Today's Papers 
 
POTUS Visit Special Edition:  U.S. President Barack Obama "Wins the 
Hearts of the Turkish People." (Vatan) 
 
The Obama Difference. (Cumhuriyet) 
Media outlets are raving over U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to 
Turkey.  Obama's messages are praised in the media, as Obama's visit 
emphasized 'a new model' for Turkey-U.S. relations and a focus on 
secularism, democratic foundations and respect for Islam.  Liberal 
Radikal carries the headline, "Let Our Partnership Be a Model." 
Islamist-oriented Zaman quotes Obama in the headline "We Can 
Establish a Model Partnership."  Mainstream Milliyet notes "Obama 
Created A New Era at the Parliament" by "Setting Off on A Journey 
With Turkey," where "The Turkey-U.S. partnership can serve as a 
model to the entire world."  Meanwhile, mainstream Sabah reports in 
"Obama's Ankara Manifesto" that Obama has three requests for Turkey, 
"Open the border with Armenia," and "Discuss the events of 1915," 
and "Open Halki Seminary."  Mainstream Hurriyet headlines "From Here 
On, We All Must Change."  Mainstream Haberturk headlines "He Didn't 
Back Down," as Obama "sent important messages to the world."   Can 
Dundar of mainstream Milliyet writes, "President Obama's visit has 
signified a new climate in Turkish-American relations.  Unlike the 
previous presidency, Obama's arrival has boosted America's approval 
ratings."  Mainstream Sabah's Mehmet Barlas comments, "In this new 
world order, the U.S. is again standing by Turkey's side."  Ali 
Bayramoglu of Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak notes, "It seems the new 
Washington administration does not share the former administration's 
obsession with security threats and the new Washington will focus on 
ways to overcome religious, cultural and other differences.  Obama's 
vision serves as an opportunity for Turkey."  Mainstream Vatan's 
Gungor Mengi writes in "The Walls Have Been Brought Down," that 
Obama's visit "is a diplomatic success for Turkey as well" because 
"after Bush's rough cowboy manner, Obama has healed the rifts 
created by Bush."  Fehmi Koru in Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak 
commented, "The framework of Obama's vision is about democracy and 
secularism in a broader sense that embracing differences. In this 
context, Turkey should be able to eliminate some of its peripheral 
problems that President Obama mentioned, like the PKK, Armenia, and 
Halki Seminary.  Turkey should exert all of its energy to present 
itself as a model country." 
 
Obama Emphasized Secularism 
Secularist and liberal papers note with beaming pride that President 
Obama emphasized Ataturk's secularist principles. 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet carries a commentary from its 
editorial board entitled "The Obama Difference" and comments, "Obama 
has proven that he is different from George Bush by showing that he 
does not see Turkey as 'a moderate Islamic State' but as a 
secularist democracy."  Cumhuriyet's banner headline today declares, 
with a tinge of welcome relief, "He Emphasized the Secular 
Democracy."  Mainstream Milliyet points out, "Obama emphasized his 
support of Ataturk's secularist principles by visiting Anitkabir in 
the morning and referring to Ataturk in his parliamentary address." 
Oktay Eksi of mainstream Hurriyet wrote, "President Obama gave very 
well crafted and substantive messages.  Obama is a leader who 
understands Ataturk better than some in Turkey."  Murat Yetkin of 
liberal Radikal commented "Obama compared Ataturk to George 
Washington," which "was the most important part of the speech" and 
"the military officials who attended the speech must have been very 
pleased."  Ismet Berkan of liberal Radikal noted, "Unlike Bush, 
President Obama is focusing on the rule of law within the context of 
Turkey's secular democracy.  This marks an enormous change in the 
U.S. approach to Turkey." 
 
Obama: "We Are Not At War With Islam." 
Also, media note the Obama delivered messages of peace to the 
Islamic world when he told the Turkish Parliament "We are not at war 
with Islam."  Under the headline, "Historic and Warm Messages," 
Islamist-oriented Zaman reports, "Obama emphasized that the U.S. 
 
ANKARA 00000515  002 OF 003 
 
 
never has been and never will be at war with Islam," and Obama 
"connected with the majority Muslim population in Turkey" by saying 
"Many Americans have Muslims in their families, including me." 
Leftist Taraf quotes President Obama in the banner headline, "We Are 
Not At War With Islam," and the paper comments "The U.S. President 
delivered message to the whole world from the Turkish Parliament," 
that "the spirit of conflict that followed 9/11 has been brought to 
an end."  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak quotes Obama in its banner 
headline, "There are Muslims in My Family," as "Obama Works To 
Repair Bush's Mistakes."  Meanwhile, Ibrahim Karagul of Yeni Safak 
writes, "Obama's words may be forgotten if there are new missile 
strikes against Afghanistan or Pakistan tomorrow." 
 
Support for Normalization of Ties Between Turkey and Armenia 
Media also point out that Obama has offered support to Turkey's 
efforts with Armenia.  Zaman notes that Obama "Gave support to 
Turkey's efforts with Armenia," and "signaled that he will not use 
the word 'genocide' to refer to the events of 1915 because he 
referred to those events as 'a difficult and tragic history,'" but 
noted "I want to do what I can to support the important positive 
developments between Turks and Armenians."  CNN Turk reports, 
"President Obama signaled that he will not use the word 'genocide' 
and noted that he wants Turkey and Armenia to work out their 
differences." 
 
Obama Gives Strong Support for Turkey's EU Bid 
Obama's messages in support of Turkey's EU bid are featured in 
several papers.  Taraf headlines with, "Europe Will Be Stronger With 
You."  Islamist Zaman comments in "Clear Messages to Europe and the 
Muslim World," that "Despite reactions from France and Germany, 
Obama emphasized 'Turkey is part of Europe."  Mainstream Milliyet 
reports "Obama gave strong support to Turkey's bid for EU entry." 
 
Rasmussen Declines to Apologize for Cartoon Crisis 
Turkiye, Zaman, Vatan, Radikal, Hurriyet, Sabah, Milliyet and 
others:  Today's papers report that former PM of Denmark and NATO's 
incoming secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen conveyed no apology 
for the international crisis that developed after a Danish newspaper 
published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammed.  Islamist-oriented Zaman 
 notes that during his speech at the Alliance of Civilizations 
meeting in Istanbul, Rasmussen tried to please the Islamic world by 
saying he respected all religions, religious symbols and religious 
sentiments of people.  Liberal Radikal reports that Rasmussen did 
not apologize but said "the freedom of expression has utmost 
importance for free societies, however we should exercise 
responsibility by showing respect to the religions and beliefs of 
others."  Mainstream Vatan reports that regarding the closure of Roj 
TV, Rasmussen said "Danish authorities are investigating the links 
between ROJ TV and the PKK.  What needs to be done will be done if 
proof is found about the links with the terrorist organization." 
Mainstream Aksam says "Rasmussen shied away from fulfilling promises 
regarding Turkey that he made in exchange for the Turkey's support 
for his bid to undertake the post of NATO Secretary General."
