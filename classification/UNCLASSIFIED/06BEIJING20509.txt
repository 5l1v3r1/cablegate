¶1.  Key points made at the September 26 MFA press briefing 
were: 
 
-- China encourages and supports U.S.-DPRK bilateral 
discussions outside of the Six-Party Talks framework. 
 
-- China hopes Tokyo's new leadership can make concrete 
efforts to improve Sino-Japan relations and the Strategic 
Dialogue between Beijing and Tokyo will "go on as long as it 
takes." 
 
-- The September 24-25 Trade Forum between China and 
Portuguese Speaking Countries in Macao attended by Commerce 
Minister Bo Xilai was a useful platform for developing 
economic and trade relations with Portuguese speaking nations. 
 
-- Despite corruption scandals involving high-level 
officials, Beijing will adhere to its policy of "reform and 
opening up." 
 
-- Any substandard schools in Beijing will be closed and it 
is "absurd to tie this issue to human rights claims." 
 
-- Signed in November 2005, the China-Chile Free Trade 
Agreement (FTA) will go into full effect on October 1, 2006 
and China seeks to increase economic and trade ties with 
Latin America. 
 
DPRK Nukes 
---------- 
 
¶2.  Discussions are still underway for Vice Foreign Minister 
Wu Dawei to travel to Seoul to discuss the North Korean 
nuclear situation with the ROK, Spokesperson Qin Gang 
confirmed at the September 26 regular MFA Press Briefing. 
Questioned by the Reuter's reporter about a recent report 
that North Korea plans to step up nuclear weapon fuel 
production, Qin answered that Beijing hopes all parties can 
work towards achieving peace and stability on the Korean 
Peninsula.  China encourages and supports U.S.-DPRK bilateral 
discussions outside of the Six-Party Talks framework, he 
added in response to a follow-up question from the same 
reporter. 
 
Japanese Election 
----------------- 
 
¶3.  Several reporters from Japan asked repeated questions 
about China's response to Shinzo Abe's Prime Ministerial 
victory in last week's Japanese elections.  Would Beijing 
send a note of congratulations?  What was China's position on 
Abe's seeming ambivalence towards Yasukuni Shrine visits? 
What were the PRC's post-election expectations?  Would Hu 
Jintao visit Tokyo?  How did Beijing feel about the 
re-appointment of Taro Aso as Foreign Minister? 
 
¶4.  China's troubled relations with Japan are well-known, Qin 
said.  At present "there are obstacles" to bilateral ties for 
obvious reasons, he said.  China hopes Abe can improve 
China-Japan relations by following up promises with concrete 
actions.  Beijing has proposed a series of policies and 
suggestions for improvements in bilateral relations, Qin 
said.  As to Yasukuni Shrine visits, China's position is 
consistent and clear, Qin added. 
 
¶5.  The conditions and timing for any state visit between Hu 
Jintao and Shinzo Abe are the same as before, Qin said.  As 
to Taro Aso remaining Japan's Foreign Minister, China hopes 
Tokyo's new leadership can make concrete efforts to improve 
Sino-Japan relations.  The improvement of such relations is 
important for the entire region, Qin added. 
 
¶6.  The Vice Ministerial Strategic Dialogue between China and 
Japan currently being held in Tokyo will "go on as long as it 
takes" Qin answered, when asked when the talks would end. 
 
Sino-Portuguese Relations 
------------------------- 
 
¶7.  State Councilor Hua Jianmin and Commerce Minister Bo 
Xilai attended the Second Ministerial Conference of the Forum 
on Economic and Trade Cooperation between China and 
 
BEIJING 00020509  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
Portuguese Speaking Countries September 24-25 in Macao, Qin 
confirmed.  Bo proposed increasing economic exchanges with 
Portuguese speaking countries and expanding trade and 
economic ties with a target goal of 45-50 billion USD in 
trade exchanges by 2008.  China also announced 8 million RMB 
worth of loans in finance, hygiene and other areas to 
Portuguese speaking countries.  The Forum is a useful 
platform to promote trade and economic relations between 
China and Portuguese speaking countries, Qin said.  Since 
1990 when Macao was returned to China, Beijing's relations 
with Portuguese speaking countries have made great headway 
and China remains optimistic and positive towards future 
exchanges and development. 
 
Shanghai Corruption Scandal 
--------------------------- 
 
¶8.  Qin deflected several questions on the sacking of 
Shanghai Party Leader Chen Liangyu for corruption, stating 
that this was not a foreign affairs matter.  Asked by 
Bloomberg if such widespread high-level corruption made 
investors nervous, Qin stated only that Beijing would adhere 
to its policy of "reform and opening up." 
 
Migrant Workers and Human Rights 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  China respects and protects the lawful rights and 
interests of its citizens, Qin stated, when asked by the 
Christian Science Monitor's reporter to comment on the 
growing number of rural petitioners camped out around Beijing 
awaiting resolution on unsettled disputes from the 
countryside. 
 
¶10.  Qin did not confirm whether a Human Rights Watch report 
that in a "pre-Olympics clean-up" of the city, over 50 
schools for the children of migrant workers had been closed. 
Everyone is entitled to education, he stated, and Beijing is 
trying to solve migrant's lack of access to education.  In 
general, substandard schools will be closed and it is "absurd 
to tie this issue to human rights claims," he said. 
 
China-Chilean Free Trade Agreement 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  Signed in November 2005, the China-Chile Free Trade 
Agreement (FTA) will go into full effect on October 1, 2006, 
Qin confirmed, in response to a Latin American reporter's 
question.  The FTA provides momentum for further bilateral 
trade, Qin added.  Latin America and China are both 
developing regions with similar concerns, he said, adding 
that China hopes to strengthen dialogue and exchanges to the 
region.
