¶1. (U) Iranian Vice President Dr. Ahmad al-Musawi visited 
Sudan on January 25 and 26 to discuss bilateral relations. 
He delivered a letter from President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad to 
President Omar al-Bashir.  In a press conference, Musawi 
said the letter outlined Iranian policy aimed at 
strengthening cooperation among Islamic states, in 
particular with African ones.  He expressed support for a 
Sudanese solution to Darfur, saying enemies want to 
interfere in Sudan's internal affairs. 
 
¶2. (U) In the press conference, Musawi also reasserted 
Iran's commitment to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and 
its right to peaceful nuclear technology.  He said referring 
the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council would 
complicate matters, and he accused Israel of orchestrating 
such a plot.  Bashir pledged support for Iran's position on 
peaceful use of nuclear technology. 
 
¶3. (U) Musawi's tour of North African countries has also 
included Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Libya, and Algeria.
