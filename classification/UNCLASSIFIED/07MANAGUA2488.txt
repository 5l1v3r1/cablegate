¶1. (U) On November 1, post delivered Nicaragua's MCC Indicator 
Scorecard to President Ortega.  While congratulating President 
Ortega on Nicaragua's continued eligibility for the MCC program, the 
Ambassador's letter highlighted slippage in the Control of 
Corruption, Rule of Law, Government Effectiveness, Voice and 
Accountability, Regulatory Quality, Inflation, and Fiscal Policy 
indicators.  The Ambassador also discussed this issue with Foreign 
Minister Santos on November 15. 
 
¶2. (U) MCC Country Director has met with Chairman of the 
MCA-Nicaragua Board Rodolfo Delgado and Presidential advisor Paul 
Oquist to review the scorecard in detail and discuss ways to follow 
up on indicator performance to ensure progress.  Delgado is 
considering tasking a member of the MCA-Nicaragua Board to work with 
relevant public institutions to improve performance on the issues 
over which they have control.
