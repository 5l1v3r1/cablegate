¶1. The following demarches were delivered between June 
28 and July 7, 2005. 
 
¶2. Over-Fortification of Small Amounts of Food Aid (REF 
A) -- Although none of the food aid referenced in the 
cable went to the Republic of Congo, Econ/Cons Officer 
presented the demarche talking points to two NGOs 
working with US food aid in Congo/B, International 
Program for Human Development and the World Food 
Program, in case they may have received some of this 
food aid indirectly.  Both NGOs report that they do not 
believe that they ever received any of the referenced 
food aid.  Non-papers were provided for reference 
purposes. 
 
¶3. Response Request on Swiss proposal for Conference on 
the Third Additional Protocol to the Geneva Convention 
(REF B) -- Delivery of the demarche was late because 
post was not slugged to receive either this or the 
original demarche cable (REF C).  Econ/Cons Officer 
delivered to Ambassador Kaya, the Interim Secretary 
General of the MFA, the French version of non-paper on 
July 8, 2005, with the request for a response as soon 
as possible. 
 
¶4. African Nations and UN Reform (REF D) -- On July 1, 
2005, the Ambassador covered the talking points with 
Kaya at the post's Independence Day celebration.  The 
US position and priorities for UN reform were already 
presented to Kaya (see REF E) and he said they would 
convey the points to already departed delegation. 
Econ/Cons Officer transmitted the French version of non- 
paper on July 7, 2005.
