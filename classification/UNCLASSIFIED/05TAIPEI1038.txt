SUBJECT: SMALL PRO-TIBETAN DEMONSTRATION AT AIT-TAIPEI 
 
 
¶1. (U) On Thursday 10 March 2005, approximately ten members 
of the Tibetan Youth Congress gathered near the American 
Institute in Taiwan (AIT-Taipei) to stage a protest marking 
the forty-sixth anniversary of the Tibetan uprising against 
Chinese communist rule.  The small band of protesters arrived 
on foot around 1000 hours local time waving Tibetan flags and 
signs that read "Release All Political Prisoners" and "No 
Human Rights in Tibet."  After leading the protesters in 
chants of "We Want Freedom and Justice", the group's leader, 
Chimmey DORJEE delivered a protest letter to the AIT Foreign 
National Investigator.  In the two-page statement, the 
Tibetan Youth Congress condemned the human rights situation 
in Tibet, and warned of the destruction of Tibetan's 
religious and cultural identity under Chinese rule.  Once the 
statement was delivered, the protesters departed the area 
without incident at 1027 hours. 
 
¶2. (U) The Da An police precinct commander provided advance 
notification about the protest and deployed additional 
uniformed officers in front of AIT to maintain order.  Police 
kept the demonstrators in a pre-designated area away from the 
Consular entrance to ensure that AIT operations were not 
disrupted.  Local Guard Force and SDT personnel were also put 
on alert, and no unusual incidents, arrests or injuries were 
reported.
