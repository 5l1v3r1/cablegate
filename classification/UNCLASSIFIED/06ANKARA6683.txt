SUBJECT: TURKEY ISSUES STATEMENT AGAINST IRAN'S HOLOCAUST 
CONFERENCE 
 
 
¶1. (U) Regarding the Tehran conference "Genocide of Jews: 
Global Perspectives," the Turkish MFA issued a statement 
December 15 that the Holocaust suffered by the Jews during 
World War II is an historical fact, and it finds attempts to 
question this historical fact to be "indecent."  This 
statement referred to a previous statement MFA made in 
December 2005 in response to a press question.  Full text of 
December 15, 2006 statement is in para 2.  Full text of 
December 9, 2005 statement is in para 3. 
 
¶2. (U)  Informal Embassy translation of MFA statement made on 
December 15, 2006: 
 
Begin text: 
 
We fully hold to the opinions expressed in the Ministerial 
statement of December 9, 2005 regarding the conference on 
"Genocide of Jews: Global Perspectives," held in Tehran on 
December 11-12, 2006.  In said statement, we clearly say that 
the "Holocaust" suffered by Jews in World War II is an 
historical fact that has tarnished the conscience of the 
world and that this crime committed against humanity has also 
been established by international law. 
 
We are agitated and upset by these attempts to question this 
historical fact and find them to be indecent.

QA 52: December 9, 2005, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mr. Namik 
Tan's reply to a question concerning a statement by Iranian 
President Ahmedinejad about the Jews: 
 
Today, international dialogue plays a significant role in 
promoting and developing friendships and understanding. 
Especially in a world full of these kinds of problems, such 
dialogue emerges as a vital requirement.  It is not possible 
to approve of such confrontational statements at a time when 
we most need dialogue, cooperation and compromise.  Such 
statements are not in the interest of anyone, either its 
author or anyone else.  They can only add to the instability 
and crisis of confidence. 
 
The genocide (Holocaust) committed against the Jews is a 
historical fact, a stain on the conscience of humanity.  This 
crime against humanity has also been established by 
international law.  As a matter of fact, our country helped 
those escaping from the Nazi persecution and provided shelter 
for them.  Lastly, Turkey accepted the relevant resolution of 
the UN General Assembly. 
 
Everyone's priority should be to solve existing problems and 
to prevent new ones and disasters.
