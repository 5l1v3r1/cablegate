Title- It was a big mistake 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (8-6) by Eliane Catanhede says: 
"....Brazil wanted to understand what Colombia is ceding to the U.S. 
[in the meeting with U.S. National Security Advisor General Jim 
Jones].  But the U.S. was interested in a more practical issue: the 
FX-2 project to renew Brazil's Air Force fighter planes....Brazil 
never accepted [the U.S. veto on Embraer jet's sale to Venezuela in 
2006] and yesterday [Brazil's Foreign] Minister stated: "It was a 
big mistake!"  Venezuelans turned to the left and bought Sukhoi's 
[airplanes] from Russia.  Brazil lost a lot, the U.S. lost a little 
and Moscow won.  In defense, Jones said it was all the Bush's 
administration fault and that from now on, everything would be 
different.  There are controversies.  The fear is that, with or 
without the letter [sent by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 
to reinforce there will be technology transfer], the U.S. sells but 
does not deliver all the order...."
