¶1.   (U) Summary: On Friday, June 12, Ambassador Callahan 
traveled to the Department of Jinotega to inaugurate a $5 
million Department of Labor (DOL) program which will combat 
child labor at coffee plantations in Jinotega and Madriz. The 
program, called ENTERATE (Combating the Worst Forms of Child 
Labor through Education in Nicaragua - see reftel C), is a 
joint effort between the USG and American Institute for 
Research (AIR). End Summary 
 
--------------------- 
ENTERATE Launch Event 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.   (U) As previously reported (see reftel C), ENTERATE is a 
three-year DOL-funded project committed to "educating child 
workers and eradicating exploitation" that targets 
approximately 10,000 Nicaraguan children ages 5-14 who work 
or at risk of working on coffee plantations in Jinotega and 
Madriz. The ENTERATE inaugural event was on June 12, the 
World Day Against Child Labor, and held at the Santa Maura 
coffee plantation, a model coffee farm without any child 
labor.  The Santa Maura coffee plantation also hosts a USAID 
Exellencia school.  Present at the ceremony were the 
Ambassador, a local Ministry of Labor representative, and 
representatives from the supporting ENTERATE NGOs:  La 
Cuculmeca, El Club Infantil, both from Jinotega; and the 
Institute for Human Advancement (INPRUH) from Somoto, Madriz. 
 
¶4.   (U) On June 12, the Ambassador gave the final remarks in 
the hour-long ceremony that included cultural presentations 
by youth from the Jinotega Club Infantil and the Somoto 
INPRUH.  Following the ceremony, the Ambassador held a brief 
press conference immediately following the event with 
ENTERATE director Melba Castillo and AIR country 
representative Marcus Broer. 
 
-------------- 
PRESS COVERAGE 
-------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Several members from the national and local press 
corps attended the event, including "La Prensa" (center-right 
national daily), Channel 12 (national TV), Radio Corporation 
and Radio Maranatha, and HOY ("La Prensa" weekly journal). 
The next day the "La Prensa" departmental section included 
photos from the event and quoted the Ambassador as saying, 
"The importance of this program is that it provides an 
excellent opportunity...for children and adolescents to 
prepare and study as a way to help fight poverty in this 
nation."

Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.   (U) The June 12 ENTERATE launch was the second time that 
the Ambassador and the Embassy organized a national press 
conference to feature this significant $5 million dollar, 
three-year program to combat child labor in Nicaragua's 
coffee region (see reftel C).  Unlike the first launch event 
of November 2008, the message about the ENTERATE program was 
not distorted by the government propaganda machine.  The 
event, which took place shortly after the Millennium 
Challenge Corporation (MCC) decided to partially terminate 
its programs in Nicaragua in response to the GON,s failure 
to address credible allegations of fraud in the November 2008 
Municipal elections (see reftel A & B), gave the Ambassador a 
chance to express and demonstrate in a tangible way that USG 
aid will continue in other areas unaffected by the MCC's 
decision.
