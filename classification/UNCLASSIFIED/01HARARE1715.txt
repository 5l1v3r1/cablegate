SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE TOBACCO SALES UPDATE, FOURTH SALES WEEK 
 
¶1. AFTER 18 TRADING DAYS, ZIMBABWE'S THREE TOBACCO AUCTION 
FLOORS HAVE COLLECTIVELY SOLD A TOTAL OF 3,665,457 KILOGRAMS 
(KG) OF THE CROP (837,031 KG IS BURLEY TOBACCO), AT AN AVERAGE 
PRICE OF US $1.69 PER KG. 
 
¶2. THIS VOLUME COMPARES WITH 6,848,511 KG FOR THE SAME PERIOD 
LAST SEASON, REPRESENTING A DROP 0F -46.5 PERCENT.  THE AVERAGE 
PRICE PER KILOGRAM OF US $1.69 REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF 54.3 
PERCENT, COMPARED TO US $1.09 DURING THE SAME PERIOD LAST 
SEASON. 
 
¶3. TOBACCO SALES HAVE SO FAR GENERATED US$6,179,730, COMPARED 
TO US$7,481,937.18 LAST SEASON, A REDUCTION OF 17.5 PERCENT. 
THE REVENUE REDUCTION, DESPITE THE HEFTY PRICE INCREASES IS 
ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LOW VOLUME OF TOBACCO BEING DELIVERED TO 
THE AUCTION FLOORS BY COMMERCIAL AND SMALL-SCALE FARMERS ALIKE. 
 
¶4. FARMERS ARE WITHHOLDING THEIR CROP BECAUSE THEY DESIRE AND 
DEEM NECESSARY A DEVALUATION (TO COVER THEIR INCREASED 
PRODUCTION COSTS DUE TO HIGH DOMESTIC INFLATION, AND THE 
SUBSTANTIAL DEVALUATION OF THE LOCAL CURRENCY ON THE PARALLEL 
MARKET), BUT GOVERNMENT SEEMS ADAMANT THAT A DEVALUATION IS NOT 
JUSTIFIABLE GIVEN THE POOR PERFORMANCE OF THE EXPORT SECTOR.

¶5. COMMENT: TO DATE, HIGHER PRICES HAVE OFFSET A SUBSTANTIAL 
DROP IN THE NUMBER OF BALES DELIVERED TO THE AUCTION FLOORS. 
HOWEVER, WITH THE COUNTRY DESPERATELY SHORT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY 
ANY HOLDBACK IS DAMAGING TO THE ECONOMY.  WITH THE GOVERNMENT 
HAVING RECENTLY THROWN THE GOLD MINERS THE LIFE RING OF A 
SELECTIVE DEVALUATION (GOLD PRODUCERS ARE NOW REIMBURSED FOR 
THEIR EXPORT SALES AT ZWD $68 EQUALS USD 1, VERSUS ONLY THE 
OFFICIAL RATE OF $55 BEING GIVEN TO THE TOBACCO FARMERS), WE 
UNDERSTAND AND SYMPATHIZE WITH THE ACTIONS OF THE COUNTRY'S 
LARGEST EXPORT SEGMENT; THE MORE SO IN LIGHT OF THE TRAVAILS 
INFLICTED UPON ZIMBABWE'S COMMERCIAL FARMING SECTOR SINCE EARLY 
LAST YEAR.  END COMMENT.
