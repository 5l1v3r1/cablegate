SUBJECT: ATLANTIC CANADA:  OFFSHORE ENERGY EXPLORATION COSTS BECOMING 
PROHIBITIVE? 
 
 
¶1.  Although there have been some major strides in reducing 
regulatory delays and costs for offshore energy exploration, 
most drilling expenses for companies looking for energy off 
Atlantic Canada are outside of the control of regulators, the 
Chair of the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board told a 
June 23 meeting of The Energy Council.  Diana Lee Dalton 
described for the group, which is meeting in Halifax for the 
first time, some of the challenges in containing expenses of 
offshore drilling operations.  The bottom line: looking for 
energy offshore Nova Scotia or Newfoundland-Labrador currently 
costs approximately C$100 million per well. 
 
¶2.  The main culprits in the rising costs, Dalton said, are 
drilling rig rates and wages for offshore workers.  There are 
only six to eight rigs in the world winterized and with dynamic 
positioning that are capable of working year-round in the harsh 
North Atlantic conditions.  Rates for these rigs have spiraled 
in recent years, to around C$480,000 per day.  Most wells 
offshore Atlantic Canada require at least 100 days to drill. 
 
¶3.  Dalton noted that regulatory approval times for exploratory 
drilling have dropped significantly, to between nine and 13 
months, down from the 18 months that it took to approve 
exploratory drilling for the Sable gas project off Nova Scotia. 
Labor rules that mandated complete crew changes when a vessel 
moved between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia waters have been 
eliminated, as have duty charges on drilling rigs that had cost 
an estimated C$1 million per well.  All of the cost savings from 
that substantial regulatory improvement, however, have been 
subsumed by drilling rig rates that have risen by 100% over the 
last few years. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT:  Energy exploration companies have frequently told 
us in recent years that the costs of looking for energy offshore 
Atlantic Canada are so high as to almost negate the area's main 
advantage -- proximity to the U.S. market.  With only one in six 
exploratory wells actually turning out to be successful, 
exploration companies are now looking at C$500 - 600 million 
just to find a producing well.  These kinds of costs blunt the 
competitive advantage that the Atlantic Canada offshore has, 
even with oil at US$70 a barrel.  Nova Scotia has been 
particularly hard-hit -- recent wells have not been successful 
and firms interested in exploring offshore have been looking 
increasingly to Newfoundland-Labrador's Orphan Basin.  END 
COMMENT.
