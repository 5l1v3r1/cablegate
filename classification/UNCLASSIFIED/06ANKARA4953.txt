SUBJECT: TURKEY: SIX BOMBINGS IN FOUR DAYS INJURE 37 
CIVILIANS 
 
REF: IIR 1 671 2529 06 
 
¶1. (SBU) Six bombs have detonated in civilian areas across 
Turkey within the last four days, injuring 37 civilians, 
according to Turkish security officials.  The evening of 
August 25, two bombs -- one outside of a bank and one at an 
office block near the city center -- exploded within five 
minutes of each other in Adana's old town,  injuring four 
civilians (Ref IIR provides additional details).  A package 
bomb, reportedly constructed from plastic A4-type explosive 
material, exploded across the street from the Sub-Governor's 
office in the Bagcilar district of Istanbul the evening of 
August 27, injuring six civilians. 
 
¶2. (SBU) There were three bombings in Marmaris, a popular 
tourist destination, in the early morning hours of August 28. 
 A minibus transiting a main boulevard was destroyed by a 
bomb placed under a seat, injuring 21 persons, including 10 
British citizens; a second explosion occurred 45 minutes 
later near a Turkish Airlines office, injuring 6 civilians; 
and a third explosion occurred near a residential block, with 
no injuries reported.  UK consular officials confirmed 
reports that 10 UK citizens were injured, some seriously, in 
the Marmaris bus attack. 
 
¶3. (SBU) No one has yet claimed responsibility for the 
bombings, although the PKK-affiliated Kurdish Freedom Hawks 
(TAK) have been linked to similar attacks in the past. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT: This most recent string of attacks, which 
clearly targeted civilians and foreign tourists, will further 
increase public pressure on the GOT to take more drastic 
action against PKK terrorists, including those operating in 
northern Iraq. END COMMENT.
