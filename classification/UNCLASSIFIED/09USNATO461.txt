SUBJECT: NATO SYG WELCOMES AFGHAN ELECTION DECISION 
 
¶1. (U) On October 20, NATO Secretary General Rasmussen issued 
a statement welcoming the decision to hold a second round of 
elections in Afghanistan.  He said the decision showed 
respect for the democratic process and institutions in 
Afghanistan.  He indicated his hope that the second round 
would achieve higher standards than had been in evidence for 
the first round, stressing that this was needed for the 
legitimacy of the government.  He urged all Afghans to 
exercise their right to vote, noting that NATO forces would 
work with Afghan security forces to ensure the security of 
the elections.

Press Release: (2009) 151 
 
Statement by the Secretary General on the Afghan elections 
 
The decision to hold a second round of elections shows 
respect for the democratic process and institutions in 
Afghanistan, and I welcome that.  The necessary steps must be 
taken to ensure that the conduct of the next round of voting 
achieves a higher standard than we saw in the first round, so 
that the Government that results from this process has 
legitimacy in the eyes of the Afghan people. 
 
I urge all Afghans to exercise their hard-won democratic 
right to vote, despite threats or intimidation by the enemies 
of the country.  NATO has the forces in place to help ensure 
security for the next round of elections, in support of 
Afghan security forces.
