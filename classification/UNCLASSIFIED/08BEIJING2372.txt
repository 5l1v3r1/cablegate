East China Sea 
-------------- 
 
¶2. At the June 17, 2008 regular MFA press briefing, MFA Spokesman 
Jiang Yu was asked repeatedly about a reported deal between China 
and Japan on oil exploration in the East China Sea.  Jiang said 
information will be released once a deal is reached.  Any agreement 
will be in accordance with the Fukuda-Hu consensus that the East 
China Sea be a "sea of peace, friendship and cooperation."  Jiang 
stressed that China's policy toward the East China Sea has not 
changed.  Jiang said that the Chunxiao oil and gas fields and their 
development as a part of China's territory is a separate issue from 
that of territorial demarcation.  Asked to clarify whether that 
meant that joint development of the area and sovereignty of the area 
are two separate issues, Jiang backed down saying only that the two 
countries are having discussions on the details which will be 
released at the appropriate time. 
 
¶3. Regarding the Diaoyu Islands and the recent collision between a 
Japanese Coast Guard vessel and a Taiwan fishing vessel, Jiang 
stressed that the Diaoyu Islands are the indisputable territory of 
China and expressed China's "grave concern" over the incident. 
Jiang called on Japan to stop its "illegitimate" activities and to 
prevent similar incidents in the future. 
 
Xi Jinping DPRK Visit 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. The spokesperson confirmed that Vice President Xi Jinping will 
visit the DPRK from June 17-19.  Jiang said that both countries are 
committed to the development of their traditional friendship.  China 
hopes the visit will promote cooperation in various fields and good 
neighborly relations. 
 
Strategic Economic Dialogue 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5. Asked about the Strategic Economic Dialogue, Jiang said that the 
two sides have been working on a 10 year cooperative framework 
document.  China hopes the talks "have good results."  Jiang 
reiterated China's position that the U.S. trade deficit is not 
caused by China's currency.  China hopes that the United States will 
take effective measures to control the trade deficit.  China is 
"seriously considering the concerns of the U.S. side and is ready to 
make joint efforts with the United States to promote mutually 
beneficial trade between the two countries." 
 
ASEM Meetings in Beijing 
------------------------ 
 
¶6. Jiang said that the Asia-Europe Parliamentary Partnership Meeting 
(ASEP) will take place on June 18.  The declaration adopted during 
this meeting will be brought to the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) 
summit to be held in Beijing in October.  China hopes that 
cooperation with Europe will result in a "win-win" situation. 
 
Australian Athletes Missing Opening Ceremony 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Asked to comment on reports that Australian athletes will not 
attend the opening ceremony for the Beijing Olympics due to 
pollution concerns, Jiang said that these concerns were not 
necessary.  China will stick to its commitments and "make efforts to 
overcome the earthquake" in preparation for the Olympic Games, said 
Jiang.  Jiang noted that Beijing has already taken more than 200 
measures to improve the environment for the Olympic Games including 
strengthening cooperation with neighboring provinces to reduce 
pollution.  During the games, the "main criteria" will be met and 
Beijing will provide a beautiful and clean environment.

torch to relevant authorities.  Jiang had not heard reports that a 
Chinese dissident committed suicide after returning from Australia.

¶9. Greek president Karolos Papoulias will visit China from June 
23-27.  Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi will visit Kazakhstan from June
