¶1. (U) Summary:  EXBS Advisor and Coordinator attended annual 
EXBS Advisor Conference in Washington DC June 9th-13th, 2008. 
 EXBS's long awaited Nonproliferation Agreement was placed 
into force on June 9th, 2008 by GOT.  MFA agrees to co-host a 
joint EXBS Nonproliferation Seminar in Ankara in September - 
October time frame.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Completed Actions for the Reporting Period: 
 
¶A. Meetings During Recent Reporting Period by EXBS Advisor 
and Coordinator: 
 
1) (U) June 9-13 - EXBS Advisor and Coordinator attended 
annual EXBS Advisor's conference in Washington, DC.  In 
addition to general country program reviews by each Advisor, 
briefings by ISN/ECC program managers, and interagency 
representatives on EXBS related initiatives, the group also 
toured DHS's National Targeting Center for Cargo in Reston, 
VA. 
 
2) (SBU) June 23 - Met with Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) 
Department Head for Nonproliferation and Disarmament, Ms. 
Elif Ulgen to discuss upcoming EXBS activities, now that the 
NP Agreement has been placed into force on June 9th, 2008. 
We discussed the need to proceed with EXBS Team border 
visits, follow through with enforcement related equipment 
deliveries to Customs Enforcement, begin in-country training 
programs to include DHS/ICE Controlled delivery and DHS/CBP 
International Border Interdiction training (IBIT II and IRIT 
II), re-engage in Commodity Identification Training (CIT) 
program collaboration,  and proceed with previously scheduled 
DOE/SLD radiation detection equipment delivery and training 
with TNP's Bomb Disposal Academy.  Ulgen agreed that all 
initiatives would receive MFA's full support and that MFA was 
comfortable with EXBS team traveling to the northwestern 
border areas in mid-July time frame.  We also discussed 
moving ahead with the EXBS Nonproliferation Seminar between 
GOT and US interagency partners.  Ulgen noted that GOT has 
begun regular interagency meetings with nonproliferation 
related agencies and that they would begin conducting 
internal border assessments of GOT's capacities and 
requirements for presentation at this seminar, which she 
believed could take place in early October. Advisor noted a 
desire to hold this seminar in Ankara as early as the first 
full week of September, but agreed to look at the best dates 
for both US and GOT agencies.  Ulgen confirmed MFA would like 
to host the seminar on-site at MFA.  Ulgen noted that MFA is 
seeking to take a measured approach with implementing the 
EXBS and other nonproliferation related programs, as moving 
too fast may result in increased resistance to implementation 
of EXBS program goals by some GOT agencies.
