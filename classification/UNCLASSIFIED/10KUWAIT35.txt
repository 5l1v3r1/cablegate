¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 6. 
 
¶2. (U) Key points: 
 
-- The Kuwait Red Crescent Society (KRCS) will wire USD 
800,000 to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red 
Crescent Societies as early as January 19. 
 
-- KRCS has already purchased aproximately 100 tons of relief 
supplies for USD 200,000, including medicine, food, and 
shelter (including 5,000 tents) that it is ready to ship to 
Haiti, and is looking for transport options. 
 
-- On January 18, Kuwait's Minister of Health approached 
Ambassador to see whether U.S. military airlift assets could 
be used to transport relief supplies.  He said Kuwait's C-130 
aircraft could carry the first 10 tons.  Embassy is 
coordinating with U.S. military in theater. 
 
End Key Points. 
 
 
¶3. (U) On January 14, Yousef Al-Merag, Director of Disaster 
relief for the Kuwait Red Crescent Society (KRCS) told 
Econoff that KCRS planned to send USD one million in cash for 
disaster relief, but was in the process of determining which 
organization to send it to (ref a).  In a January 18 
conversation, however, Kuwaiti Health Minister Dr. Hilal 
Musaed Al-Sayer told Ambassador that the GoK would be 
providing 50 tons of relief supplies identified for 
assistance to Haiti.  Al-Sayer stated that the Kuwait Air 
Force could deliver the first 10 tons with its own C-130 
aircraft, but was looking for a way to provide the rest of 
the assistance.  He asked whether the GoK could use U.S. 
military aircraft, which he understood were returning to the 
U.S. empty to deliver the goods.  Post's Office of Military 
Cooperation contacted the U.S. Air Force Wing Commander 
(386th Air Expeditionary Wing Command), who explained that 
most C-17 U.S. military aircraft routing through Kuwait were 
not returning to the U.S. but rather staying in theatre. 
Ambassador Jones thanked the Dr. Al-Sayer for Kuwait's 
efforts to support Haiti, noted the preference for cash 
donations, and committed to checking on the availability of 
U.S. Military Aircraft and on the modalities needed to 
deliver "in-kind" assistance. 
 
¶4.  (U) Econcouns and Econoff followed up with Al-Merag on 
January 18 and 19th.  According to Al-Merag, due to the 
difficulties finding transportation assets, the KRCS will be 
sending $800,000 immediately to International Federation of 
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and hold the 
remaining $200,000 USD worth of in-kind supplies in their 
warehouse until transportation can be finalized.  He stated 
"we are losing time and the people of Haiti need support 
immediately".   Al-Merag said that KRCS had put together a 
relief package in its warehouse of up to 105 tons.  The 
shipment (in priority order): first aid and medical supplies 
(10 tons), food, 300 tents (which could be increased to 5,000 
when transport is available), and blankets would be sent to 
Haiti as soon as the logistics for transportation were 
finalized. 
 
¶5. (U) Econoff was told by KRCS that Kuwait believes the 
situation in Haiti is worse than originally expected and 
therefore the humanitarian supplies from Kuwait are 
considered to be only an initial immediate response.  The GoK 
is now reviewing the situation and considering what 
additional aid could be sent in the near future.  Ambassador, 
Econcouns, and Econoff have expressed our thanks for Kuwait's 
generous planned contributions to Haiti. 
 
¶6. (U) Action Request:  Post would appreciate specific 
guidance on coordinating with the GoK on shipping in kind 
assistance to Haiti.
