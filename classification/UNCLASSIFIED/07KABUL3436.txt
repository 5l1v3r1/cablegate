SUBJECT: KABUL MEDIA REACTION: RECENT SUICIDE BOMBINGS 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: Media commentators expressed grave concerns about what a 
spate of suicide bombing attacks in Kabul in the last week means for 
the nation's security. Editorials condemned the attacks, expressed a 
lack of faith in the Afghan government's ability to deal with the 
increased threat, and outrage that the attacks took place during the 
Muslim holy month of Ramadan. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. An unsigned editorial in the Oct. 3 edition of Anis, a 
government-sponsored daily, read: "Yesterday morning the terrorists 
or the enemies of Islam and peace committed another felony by 
fiercely targeting children, women, elders, and ANP (Afghan National 
Police) personnel. These activities are against Islamic bonds and 
they are rejected by all means ... We should all put forth greater 
efforts in the prevention of the security situation's move towards 
vulnerability, and should stop the terrorists from repeating the 
tragedies of past years once again while the risk of their growth is 
felt to be increasing day by day." 
 
¶3. An unsigned editorial in the Oct. 3 edition of Rahenejat, an 
independent daily, read: "In a period of less than a week two 
suicide attacks took place in capital city of Kabul targeting those 
responsible for sustaining security and prevention of such attacks. 
These incidents take place in the holy month of Ramadan, which is 
known as the month of sympathy, forgiveness and generosity... The 
occurrence of such incidents in the capital city seriously 
undermines the efforts to sustain security by national and 
international security forces. The reforms in ANP and other security 
administrations are taking place without an assessment of current 
security conditions which has resulted in the failure of security 
officials to prevent the aforementioned incidents. 
 
"On the other hand, police and military uniforms are sold in any 
shop without any restrictions, even foreign security forces' high 
ranking official's uniforms are sold in shops, which the terrorists 
and armed robbers use for committing crime in different ways. All 
these factors are causing a lack of security, and instability, all 
over the country and the necessity for a new and well-assessed 
security strategy is felt more than anything else in the country." 
 
¶4. An unsigned editorial in Hewad, a government-run daily, on Oct. 
3, read: "Terrorists committed another felony yesterday morning by 
the suicide attack on the ANP personnel bus which resulted in the 
death of 10 and the serious injury of 17 Afghans. Yesterday suicides 
once again proved that terrorists do not have any respect for 
people's spiritual values. Ramadan is a month of prayers and a true 
Muslim should avoid any kind of violence. The terrorists want to 
spread fear among the nation and to reach their goals they will not 
spare any sort crime or felony. 
 
"We urge Afghan security forces and foreign security forces to 
review the current security measures and come up with new tactics to 
prevent terrorists from entering the country and targeting both 
civilian and military personnel."
