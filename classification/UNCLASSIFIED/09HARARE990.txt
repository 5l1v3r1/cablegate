¶1.  (U) Zimbabwean government agencies routinely provided 
assistance by conducting investigative inquiries, traces, and 
border checks of individuals thought to be threats to U.S. 
government facilities or personnel.  Zimbabwe's continued 
economic decline, however, has had a detrimental impact on 
local law enforcement and national security elements 
responsible for implementing and coordinating counterterrorsm 
efforts.  The Suppression of Foreign and International 
Terrorism Bill, enacted in August 2007 to combat terrorism 
and mercenary activities in Zimbabwe, has been redirected to 
suppress opponents of ZANU-PF leaders and policies. 
 
¶2.  (U) Although generally cooperative, Zimbabwean law 
enforcement officials have been reluctant to take or 
recommend actions that would be seen as pro-American.  This 
has undermined efforts to foster greater cooperation, to 
include U.S. funding and training opoprtunties.
