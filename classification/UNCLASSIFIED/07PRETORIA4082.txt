¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) Deputy 
Director-General: Electricity and Nuclear Energy Nelisiwe Magubane 
met DOE Director for African and Middle Eastern Affairs George 
Person and Energy Officer on November 16 on the margins of the 
Corporate Council on Africa Business Summit, flying to Cape Town 
from Pretoria specifically for a meeting on bilateral energy 
cooperation.  Person advocated increased bilateral energy 
cooperation in a range of areas.  Magubane welcomed increased 
cooperation and described energy planning and electricity shortages. 
 Magubane promised to identify dates for the planned meeting of a 
new Joint Standing Committee on Nuclear Energy Cooperation (but this 
bilateral did not otherwise cover nuclear issues - Ref A.)  End 
Summary.

Next Steps on Energy Planning 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Magubane described the process for national energy 
planning, building from the September Energy Summit and 
consultations with stake-holders (Ref B).  She said the new White 
Paper - Master Plan was under review and consultations with the 
Provinces for six months.  Then, it would be reviewed by cabinet for 
about six months.  Finally, the new white paper would be presented 
to Parliament via the Portfolio Committee on Minerals and Energy. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Magubane summarized the plan as targeting a change in 
South Africa's energy mix from overwhelmingly coal to a mix of 60 
percent coal, 10 percent gas, and 25 percent nuclear.  She said the 
SAG was striving to increase the role of demand side management, 
renewable energy, and energy efficiency.  Magubane pointed out that 
the DME is tasked with energy policy and planning, while the 
Ministry of Public Enterprises serves as state share-holder for 
state electricity supplier Eskom. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Electricity Woes - Wet Coal Excuse is Bogus 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Magubane cited challenges for South Africa's grappling 
with growth-driven electricity shortages, leading Eskom to forecast 
5-8 years of load-shedding until it brings on new supply.  She 
expressed frustration with Eskom's seeming ineptitude in handling 
recent problems.  She surmised that there was miscommunication 
between management and technical personnel, citing the absurd claim 
that "wet coal" had been a cause of recent power outages.  Magubane 
said the outages were due to a combination of demand growth, supply 
chain delays in new plants, planned maintenance, and unforeseen 
plant problems. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Magubane recognized that electricity is priced too cheaply 
(1-2 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour), hampering the SAG's ability to 
put in place demand-side management, incentives, and smart metering 
systems.  She pointed out that Eskom's new build and new private 
Independent Power Producers (like AES, in the running as "preferred 
bidder") would benefit from higher priced take-or-pay contracts. 
She said the SAG should look at fuel switching, cogeneration, and 
QShe said the SAG should look at fuel switching, cogeneration, and 
developing a gas market.

Areas of Potential Cooperation 
------------------------------ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Magubane thanked Person for the effort that went into 
making the visit of her delegation to Washington D.C. last April a 
success.  She and Person identified skills development, energy 
efficiency, renewable energy, and energy planning/modeling as areas 
of potential cooperation (without delving into nuclear energy 
cooperation). 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Magubane promised Energy Officer that she would consult 
with the SAG to identify dates for the launch of the Joint Standing 
 
PRETORIA 00004082  002 OF 002 
 
 
Committee on Nuclear Energy Cooperation (JSCNEC), as agreed during 
the April visit and reaffirmed recently (Refs A and C).  Embassy 
followed up with a request for this information by diplomatic note.
