SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY.  On September 2, post declared a disaster due to the 
effects of severe flooding in the capital, Ouagadougou (ref A), 
following unusually heavy rain on September 1.  In response, USAID's 
Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) provided 
$120,000 to support water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions. 
Local, regional, and international response efforts appear at 
present to be meeting the basic humanitarian needs of the 
approximately 63,000 people displaced by the floods, although 
assistance gaps remain.  However, the transition from emergency to 
recovery faces numerous challenges, including the logistical hurdle 
of relocating displaced people from schools before the scheduled 
start of the school year on October 1.  Priorities for the 
transition phase include assisting with humanitarian support at 
relocation sites and helping flood-affected populations rebuild both 
homes and livelihoods.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------- 
POST-FLOOD CRISIS STABILIZATION 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Emergency assistance to date from the Government of Burkina Faso 
(GoBF), donors, and international relief agencies appears to be 
meeting the basic humanitarian needs of the approximately 63,800 
people displaced by the floods in Ouagadougou.  Displaced people are 
currently sheltering in 88 temporary sites throughout the city, 
including schools, churches, and public buildings.  Initial press 
and GoBF reports indicated that the floods had displaced 
approximately 150,000 people.  However, as of September 14, the 
Burkinabe Red Cross Society (BRCS), the national Red Cross society, 
reported approximately 63,000 displaced people, following surveys of 
the temporary sites.  The GoBF currently estimates approximately 
70,000 displaced people. (NOTE:  Relief agencies providing emergency 
assistance report privately that even the BRCS figures may 
overestimate the actual number of displaced people.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶3.  Relief agencies continue to assess displacement, damage to 
infrastructure and individual homes, and the humanitarian needs of 
flood-affected populations. In addition to displaced in the 88 
sites, other flood affected who are sheltering with friends and 
relatives are more difficult to identify and are not included in the 
63,000 estimate.  The GoBF has diverted water from outside the 
capital to ensure a sufficient water supply in Ouagadougou until two 
flood-damaged generators can be repaired.  The GoBF, U.N. agencies, 
and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent 
Societies (IFRC) have reported some flood damage outside 
Ouagadougou, particularly in Bagre and Boulgou districts.  However, 
in discussions with USAID/OFDA staff, representatives of Save the 
Children and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N. (FAO) 
have indicated relatively minor flood damage outside Ouagadougou 
compared to conditions in the capital. 
 
¶4.  Should Burkina Faso experience normal rather than exceptional 
rainfall in the coming months, prospects for continued post-disaster 
stabilization and transition to recovery appear favorable. 
 
----------------- 
EMERGENCY REPONSE 
----------------- 
 
¶5.  In addition to the prompt arrival in-country of U.N., donor, and 
non-governmental organization (NGO) assessment and coordination 
teams, the GoBF and the BRCS have responded proactively to emergency 
needs.  Within five days of the floods, the BRCS conducted a survey 
of displacement in 86 of the 88 temporary relocation sites.  The 
survey findings provided initial planning figures for distribution 
of emergency relief food and non-food supplies by humanitarian 
 
OUAGADOUGO 00000753  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
organizations.  In addition, the GoBF Ministry of Health temporarily 
waived treatment fees for malaria, diarrheal disease, and 
respiratory infections in flood-affected neighborhoods.  Finally, 
the GoBF-organized Solidarity Week launched on September 7 raised 
USD 4.8 million in cash and in-kind donations to assist in emergency 
relief efforts. 
 
¶6.  Emergency relief supplies continue to arrive in Burkina Faso. 
The U.N. and IFRC have both issued flash appeals to raise additional 
support for flood relief and recovery to transition during the next 
six months.  Relief agencies are conducting disease prevention 
campaigns.  The U.N. World Food Program (WFP), Africare, and 
Catholic Relief Services (CRS) are providing emergency food 
assistance to displaced populations in all temporary sites through 
the end of September.  In addition, countries in the region, 
including Morocco and Libya, have contributed emergency food 
supplies, tents, and other commodities.  Following visits to several 
temporary sites, USAID/OFDA staff report calm and order among the 
displaced populations. 
 
--------------- 
ASSISTANCE GAPS 
--------------- 
 
¶7.  Current gaps in the humanitarian response include inadequate 
efforts to address sanitation needs and insufficient efforts by both 
the GoBF and international relief agencies to consider medium- to 
long-term challenges for populations displaced by floods.  A focus 
on ensuring an orderly and equitable distribution of emergency 
relief supplies in the short term has resulted in a lack of 
attention to the resources and assistance displaced populations will 
need to rebuild their livelihoods and their homes.  An eventual 
recovery will require that the GoBF and relief agencies recalibrate 
relief efforts to help displaced populations return home and 
reestablish livelihoods. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
NEW SCHOOL YEAR HURDLE IN TRANSITION TO RECOVERY 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶8.  A majority of the approximately 63,000 people displaced by 
floods are currently sheltering in schools.  The school year is 
scheduled to start on October 1.  In order to ensure a timely start 
to the school year, the GoBF plans to relocate displaced populations 
to other temporary sites.  To date, however, the GoBF has not 
presented a list of relocation sites, despite assurances given at 
humanitarian coordination meetings.  The delay will extend the 
initial emergency phase of the humanitarian response, as relief 
agencies will likely need to devote additional resources to help 
relocate displaced populations quickly and to provide services at 
new sites.  On September 11, an IFRC emergency team arrived 
in-country and is assessing the viability of potential relocation 
sites.  A team from the NGO MapAction, attached to the U.N. Disaster 
Assessment and Coordination Team currently deployed to Burkina Faso, 
accompanied the IFRC team to map potential locations in order to 
facilitate humanitarian planning for the impending relocations. 
 
¶9.  It is unclear, however, how many displaced people will choose to 
relocate to new temporary sites.  Some may return to their damaged 
homes, while others may squat in non-school public buildings or be 
further absorbed into host communities.  In addition, eventual 
rebuilding efforts may be further complicated by the fact that most 
people displaced by floods rented their homes and thus do not own 
land on which to rebuild.  Compounding the difficulties, the GoBF 
has announced rebuilding restrictions in some flood zones without 
providing information on potential sites for permanent 
resettlement.

¶10.  In response to post's disaster declaration on September 2, 
USAID/OFDA provided $50,000 for the procurement of 30 water storage 
units for use in affected areas.  Post consigned the water storage 
units to CRS.  In coordination with the GoBF and international 
relief agencies, CRS is currently placing the tanks in temporary 
displacement sites throughout the city.  On September 17, U.S. 
Embassy and USAID staff plan to monitor the placement of the water 
storage units. 
 
¶11.  On September 11, the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF),with $70,000 
in funds from USAID/OFDA, provided supplies in water, sanitation, 
and hygiene interventions throughout Ouagadougou. 
 
¶12.  USAID's Office of Food for Peace (USAID/FFP) granted approval 
to CRS and Africare to direct 10 percent (742.8 metric tons)of 
current USAID/FFP-funded multi-year food assistance in Burkina Faso 
to meet emergency needs over the first month.  Total value of food 
commodities provided is USD 752,000. 
 
¶13.  Since September 4, a USAID/OFDA acting Senior Program Officer 
has been stationed in Burkina Faso to assess humanitarian needs and 
closely monitor relief efforts, as well as USAID/OFDA's projects 
under the Global Food Security Response (GFSR). USAID/OFDA staff 
will continue to monitor the transition from emergency to recovery 
in conjunction with the U.S. Embassy in Ouagadougou, USAID/West 
Africa, USAID/FFP, and humanitarian partners.
