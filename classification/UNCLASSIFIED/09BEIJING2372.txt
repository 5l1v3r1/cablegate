  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  U.S-JAPAN-CHINA 
 
"The U.S. does not need to use 'Japan's nuclear weapons' to deter 
China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (08/17): "At Japan's insistence, the U.S. has 
promised to provide 'nuclear protection' to Japan.  The U.S. also 
did this in order to dissipate Japanese ambitions to develop nuclear 
weapons.  Preventing Japan from getting out of control and even 
again joining an opposition against the U.S. is a central part of 
the U.S.'s long-term strategic considerations vis-`-vis Japan. 
There is little possibility that the U.S. would allow Japan to 
develop nuclear weapons.  Thus, the former Speaker of the U.S. House 
of Representatives' comment that one day China will have to choose 
between a denuclearized North Korea and a nuclear-armed Japan is 
only an attempt to put more pressure on China.  On the one hand, the 
U.S. says North Korea's nuclear threat is not really that serious; 
but, on the other hand, the U.S. hypes the danger of Japan's nuclear 
armament in an attempt to corner China.  China will not be pressured 
into changing its stance on the North Korean nuclear issue.  Thus, 
the U.S. does not need to use the 'Japan card' to deter China." 
 
¶2.  U.S. BURMA POLICY 
 
"Another example of 'smart power'" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao) (08/17): "U.S. Senator Jim Webb's visit to Burma 
has political implications.  It demonstrates that the U.S. 
government's policy of sanctioning Burma has changed into one of 
'contact and dialogue.'  The improvement in U.S.-Burma relations is 
not only helpful for the U.S. to obtain Burmese oil resources, but 
also to strengthen the U.S.'s presence in Southeast Asia to counter 
China's influence in the region.  The U.S. policy change with regard 
to Burma is another example of Secretary Clinton's 'smart power.' 
Obama is using 'smart power' to deal with hostile countries, 
including Cuba, Venezuela, and North Korea.  The U.S. government has 
realized that suppressing Burma will not help win that country over. 
 Besides, Burma's recent 'close contact' with North Korea, 
especially in the military arena, concerns the U.S.  Analysts 
believe that if the U.S. continues to isolate Burma, in a few years 
Burma will become the second North Korea and it will be too late 
then for the U.S. to change policy." 
 
¶3. CHINA TRADE RELATIONS 
 
"Not all of China's trade disputes are bad" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (08/17): "The U.S. 
is the country that has the most trade disputes with China. 
Although the U.S. has always made a lot of noise about these 
disputes, they can usually be resolved smoothly.  Resolving trade 
disputes has helped China become more and more of a market economy. 
Indeed, trade disputes can help China re-examine and reflect on its 
economic development model, which is currently too dependent on 
exports.  The basic way to resolve these trade disputes is for China 
to decrease exports and increase domestic demand.  This is also the 
best method for achieving sustainable economic development in China. 
 Even if China succeeds in shifting to a more domestic demand-driven 
economy, trade disputes may still exist, albeit in a slightly 
different form.  When China's economy depends more on consumption 
than on exports, China will increasingly play the role of the 
plaintiff in trade disputes rather than the passive role of the 
defendant."
