PROGRAM 
 
 
On February 2, business and financial daily "Diario Financiero" 
(circ. 20,000) carried a column by Leonidas Irarrazaval on Iran. 
Quotes: 
 
"Now we must wait and see what the West does with a new Iranian 
leader...who wants Iran to have the same nuclear might as the 
Western powers, India, Pakistan and probably Israel.  Is it moral to 
prevent him from doing so?....  Not even the UN will be able to stop 
him, because countries needing Iran's oil--such as Russia and 
China--have a veto.  If Bush manages to emerge from the Afghan and 
Iraqi quagmire with sufficient time remaining in office he might 
launch a new crusade against Iran...and the result may be equally 
uncertain."
