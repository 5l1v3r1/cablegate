diplomacy, our excuses regarding the inconsiderate, obscene, 
and lewd statements made against her last Sunday by President 
Chavez during a public speech. 
 
This is not the first time that the President has exhibited 
such behavioral traits without restraint in the media, 
offending the dignity of our people with such shameful 
behavior, which has even affected his own wife and degraded 
the presidential office. 
 
The democratic women of Venezuela do hereby state that we 
reject not only such disrespectful language but we especially 
reject the sexist, macho, and authoritarian concept hidden 
behind it that we have tried to eradicate with our struggle 
to reach true gender equality in our country and in the world. 
 
With our respectful consideration, we remain, very truly 
yours, 
 
The National Women's Front:
