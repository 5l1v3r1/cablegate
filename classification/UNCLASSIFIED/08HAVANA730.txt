SUBJECT:  MGHH01: USINT HAVANA EMERGENCY ACTION COMMITTEE PREPARES 
FOR HURRICANE IKE 
 
¶1. Post's Emergency Action Committee (EAC) met this afternoon to 
discuss preparations for Hurricane Ike which is currently 400-500 
miles east of Cuba. 
 
¶2. Current projections indicate that winds from Ike will reach the 
northwest portion of the island early Wednesday morning and will 
likely range between tropical storm and hurricane force. 
 
¶3. Preventive measures and follow-up work from Hurricane Gustav are 
still in place and largely complete.  No significant additional 
actions are planned for now.  Post discussed planning for authorized 
departure, storm surges and the relocation of USINT families living 
nearest the coast but the decision to implement these measures was 
held in abeyance pending more definitive tracking data from the 
National Hurricane Center. 
 
¶4. Post EAC has a tentative meeting planned for Sunday, September 
¶7.
