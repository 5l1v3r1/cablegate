¶1.  SUMMARY: Government of Senegal (GOS) and European 
Union (EU) representatives, after three rounds of 
negotiations, failed to agree on the new terms of the 
bilateral Senegal-EU fishing agreement.  As a result, on 
June 30 at midnight, the Senegal-EU Fishing Agreement 
expired and the last of the French, Portuguese and Spanish 
fishing vessels that once plied Senegalese waters have now 
left.  The vessels, however, remain nearby in 
international waters, hopeful that, as Senegal urgently 
needs the money, an agreement will be reached by the end 
of July.  Senegalese-EU talks broke down when Dakar 
demanded a 60 percent reduction in European quotas, which 
currently only make up 2 percent of total Senegalese 
catches, while maintaining the 10.5 billion CFA francs 
(CFAF) (USD 21 million) in compensation stipulated in the 
standing agreement.  The two parties also disagreed on the 
number of authorized Senegalese coast guards in EU fishing 
vessels.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  According to EU colleagues and local press reports, 
Senegalese and EU negotiators have been unable to hammer 
out a new fishing deal after three rounds of negotiations 
that started in early April 2006.  Senegal wants the most 
lucrative agreement possible while protecting its aquatic 
ecosystem.  The current agreement (July 1, 2002 - June 30, 
2006) - the seventeenth agreement since 1979 - provided 
for annual financial compensation of 10.5 billion CFAF to 
the GOS, an increase of 25 percent over the previous 
agreement (May 1997-April 2001).  The 2002-2006 agreement 
also prohibited EU vessels from fishing for pelagic 
species. 
 
¶3.  In this round of negotiations, EU fishing officials 
have proposed 6 billion CFAF, while demanding an increase 
in the amount of catch and the number of vessels.  In the 
earlier agreement, Senegal granted the EU rights to 23 
trawlers with a quota of 8,000 gross register tons (GRT) 
per year, 66 tuna vessels including 55 canning vessels and 
23 surface trawlers. 
 
¶4.  EU fishing officials want to reduce the quantity of 
tuna supplied to Senegalese tuna factories.  While 
factories are only required to obtain 25 percent of their 
raw materials from Senegalese vessels, the remaining 75 
percent must be supplied by foreign EU vessels. 
 
¶5.  In order to ensure that EU vessels comply with local 
regulations and to verify the size and species of their 
catches, foreign vessels are required to recruit, at their 
own expense, 50 percent of their crew from the Senegalese 
coast guard.  In the current negotiations EU fishing 
officials are proposing a reduction in the number of 
Senegalese inspectors. 
 
¶6.  Senegalese fishermen's associations have denounced the 
agreement, citing their fears of permanent ecological 
damage from over fishing by the more sophisticated and 
efficient EU fleet.  Locals also decry the alleged 
overexploitation of higher-value fish, increasingly 
difficult to find in markets.  A study released by the 
Japanese Agency for International Cooperation (JICA) this 
month concluded that five out of Senegal's top seven fish 
species were in critical condition and required a prompt 
reduction in fishing in order to recover.  However, local 
media recently reported that EU catches represent only 2 
percent of annual volume.  National associations also want 
more of the benefits of any EU agreement to flow to their 
sector to help upgrade and modernize their fleets.  In the 
past, compensation from fishing agreements has gone 
directly to the government rather than the industry. 
 
¶7.  On July 6, Djibo Leity Ka, Senior Minister of Maritime 
Economy and International Maritime Transport, announced a 
new presidential initiative to revitalize the fishing 
sector, at an estimated cost of 46 billion CFAF (USD 92 
million).  He noted that the Government had already 
contributed 8 billion CFAF (USD 16 million) to the sector, 
and that 32 billion CFAF (USD 64 million) had been 
negotiated with the African Development Bank, but did not 
mention whether financing would come from proceeds from an 
agreement with the EU.  The Government of Japan, which has 
already financed more than 10 projects in the fishing 
sector, has just donated 4.5 billion CFAF (USD 9 million) 
 
DAKAR 00001703  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
for a modern fishing center in Lompoul, which President 
Wade inaugurated on July 7. 
 
¶8.  Despite a drop in earnings in 2006, fish exports 
remain the country's leading export.  The GOS estimates 
that the fishing sector employs more than 600,000 people, 
generates significant temporary employment in the informal 
sector, and contributes significantly to the Senegalese 
diet. 
 
¶9.  COMMENT: Because the GOS needs the EU funds a new 
agreement would bring to supplement its budget and upgrade 
the national fleet, we expect Senegal to push negotiations 
to closure when they resume in the near future.  END 
COMMENT.
