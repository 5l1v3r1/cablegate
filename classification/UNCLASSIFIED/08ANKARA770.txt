In Today's Papers 
 
Ankara Celebrates National Sovereignty Day in Tense Atmosphere 
All papers report that on Wednesday, the atmosphere was tense at the 
Turkish Parliament's special session to mark National Sovereignty 
and Children's Day.  Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Erdogan and 
opposition CHP leader Baykal avoided each other during the 
ceremonies in Ataturk's Mausoleum.  In his speech to the parliament, 
Baykal argued the Constitution and law lie at the heart of any 
government's legitimacy, and elections alone are not enough for a 
functioning democracy.  "Uncontrolled force is no force," Baykal 
said, defending supervision of elected governments by state bodies. 
 Erdogan countered, saying "There is no replacement in today's world 
for democracy.  We have to defeat all threats via democracy." 
Erdogan added that the Turkish nation is moving toward its EU 
membership goal and never before had Turkey been so close to making 
these ideals a reality.  The Chief of the General Staff (TGS) 
General Yasar Buyukanit and the military top brass left the 
parliament after attending only the ceremony ahead of the special 
session in an effort to avoid contacts with the pro-Kurdish DTP 
lawmakers. 
 
Also yesterday, President Abdullah Gul hosted a luncheon at the 
Presidential Palace.  Baykal boycotted the luncheon, but Parliament 
Speaker Koksal Toptan, PM Erdogan, and chairmen of the political 
parties represented at the parliament attended.  Gul said during the 
luncheon, "terrorism, separatism, the economy, and democratic 
standards" were some of the current risks and opportunities for 
Turkey.  "If Turkey cannot transform risks into opportunities within 
the framework of today's conjuncture, the next generations would pay 
the price," Gul said. 
 
Erdogan Mediates between Olmert-Assad for Peace 
Milliyet, Aksam, and Cumhuriyet carry reports by Syrian daily 
al-Watan that, according to sources in Damascus, Turkish Prime 
Minister Erdogan told Syrian President Bashar al-Asad in a telephone 
call that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was ready for a full 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights in return for a peace agreement 
with Syria.  Syria's state television carried the same report, says 
the leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet.  The paper says Erdogan is to 
visit Damascus on April 26-27 to attend the opening of the first 
Syrian-Turkish economic forum. 
 
General Petraeus Next Head of CENTCOM 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Taraf, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, Yeni 
Safak and others report General David Petraeus, the top US commander 
of troops in Iraq, has been nominated by Defense Secretary Robert 
Gates for Central Command CENTCOM chief.  Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno will 
be nominated by President Bush to replace Petraeus in Baghdad. 
Papers also note Odierno was known as the American commander who had 
ordered the 'hooding' of Turkish Special Forces in Suleymaniye in 
northern Iraq in 2003. 
 
Calik Takes Over Sabah Media Group 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Vatan, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and 
others report the 'Turkuvaz' media company of the Calik Group has 
completed the USD 1.1 billion purchase of Turkey's second largest 
media company, Sabah- ATV..  Sabah-ATV was seized from the Ciner 
Group by the Savings Deposits and Insurance Fund (TMSF) last April 
because of financial irregularities and auctioned off last November. 
 Calik said in a written statement on Tuesday it paid cash to TMSF 
for the group by obtaining USD 750 million-loans from state-owned 
'Vakifbank' and 'Halkbank', USD 125 million from Qatar-based 
al-Wasaeel International Media Co., and the remainder from Calik 
shareholders.  Al-Wasaeel will reportedly receive 25 percent of 
shares in Turkuvaz in return for their contribution. 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet and mainstream Vatan say they have 
found no record of al-Wasaeel company in Qatar Chamber of Commerce 
records..

Human Rights Organization Publishes 'Torture Atlas' 
Mainstream Sabah reports on page one the Turkish Human Rights 
Foundation (TIHV) has prepared a book on torture and mistreatment in 
Turkey since the September 12, 1980 military takeover.  The book, 
"The Atlas of Torture," was written by nine professors and 
physicians who have examined 6,000 photos and x-ray films of more 
than 10,000 torture victims in five years.  It says over the course 
of past 28 years, one million people were tortured in Turkey.  The 
book says beating was the most popular torture method, to be 
followed by electric shock, strangling, rape, cold water and 
exposure to chemical substances. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Iraq, US Elections 
 
"Iraq, Kirkuk and the PKK" 
Soli Ozel wrote in mainstream Sabah (4/24): "What happens in Iraq is 
of immediate concern to Turkey.  The future of Iraq will be the 
primary factor in shaping the power equilibrium in the Middle East 
and Gulf region.  There will be no clarity on Iraq's future until 
the internal power struggle comes to an end. At this point, the only 
clear thing is that Iran has become a powerful player.   It is very 
likely that Iraq will continue living with violence and uncertainty. 
 Yet despite all these factors , Iraq's territorial integrity serves 
everybody's interest.  Foreign Minister Babacan, after attending the 
Iraqi Neighbors Conference, made this observation and added that 
everybody seems to have finally come to Turkey's opinion on the 
importance of Iraq's territorial integrity.  Babacan also sees the 
Hydrocarbon Law as a good indication of a functioning Iraq.  On 
Kirkuk, which the FM describes as very important, the UN's position 
is close to Turkey'sviews." 
 
"Uncertainty in US Elections" 
Sami Kohen wrote in mainstream Milliyet (4/24): "There is a saying 
that 'the route to the White House goes through Pennsylvania.' 
Pennsylvania is a determining factor for presidential candidates. 
This time, two Democrat candidates struggled through and the race 
ended with Hillary Clinton's winning over Obama by 10 percent.  That 
victory gives her hope in the upcoming primaries , but it does not 
give her an automatic ticket to the White House.  The question of 
whether Clinton can be the Democrat Party candidate remains 
controversial.  Impartial observers still feel Obama's candidacy has 
a better chance while others concede that nothing is certain until 
the last minute.  The race between Hillary and Obama has been very 
harsh and it goes without saying that Republicans are enjoying all 
of this because whoever becomes the Democrat candidate, he or she 
will come wounded in the public eye into the main election..  The 
opinion polls are already indicating that Republican candidate 
McCain is gaining more ground to win the elections.  If the 
Democratic candidate is Obama, that will be a help for McCain to 
win.  A recent survey in Pennsylvania found 21 percent of democrats 
are planning to vote for McCain if Obama is the candidate. "
