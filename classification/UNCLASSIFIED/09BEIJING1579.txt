SUBJECT: JUNE 11 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: DPRK, CLIMATE CHANGE, GITMO 
UIGHURS, AFGHANISTAN, INDIA, SCO SUMMIT 
 
¶1. Key points at the June 11 MFA press briefing: 
 
-- The UN Security Council (UNSC) should adopt a "responsible and 
balanced resolution" to promote the denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula and safeguard peace and stability in the region. 
 
-- China had a "positive and responsible attitude" toward climate 
change, but China was a developing country whose acceptance of 
binding or compulsory targets was not possible. 
 
-- China was opposed to any third country accepting the Uighurs 
detained at Guantanamo Bay and urged the United States to abide by 
its international obligations on counterterrorism, stop handing over 
terrorists to third countries and expatriate the Uighurs to China. 
 
 
-- China was willing to deepen its support for Afghanistan's 
reconstruction "within China's capabilities." 
 
-- China "cannot accept India's accusations" regarding Chinese 
military incursions into India and hoped that "relevant figures and 
press in India would take a responsible attitude to benefit 
bilateral relations." 
 
-- China hoped the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit 
would enhance mutual trust and boost security, economic and trade 
cooperation between member states. 
 
DPRK 
---- 
 
¶2.  The UN Security Council should adopt a "responsible and balanced 
resolution" to promote the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula 
and safeguard peace and stability in the region, said spokesperson 
Qin Gang at the June 11 regularly scheduled Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs press briefing.  China was taking part in UN Security 
Council consultations with a "responsible and earnest attitude." 
North Korea's May 25 nuclear test was in contravention to the will 
of the international community, and China's position on the nuclear 
test was clear.  Regarding the 60th anniversary of China-DPRK 
relations, Qin said the two countries had "normal state-to-state 
relations" based on the principle of peaceful co-existence.  Vice 
Foreign Minister Wu Dawei met South Korean Six-Party Talks envoy Wi 
Sung-lac June 9, and the two agreed to make joint efforts to bring 
North Korea back to Six-Party Talks and to strengthen cooperation to 
safeguard stability on the Korean Peninsula. 
 
Climate Change 
-------------- 
 
¶3.  Asked about Japan's announcement that it would reduce emissions 
15 percent by 2020, Qin said Japan's new target was only two percent 
more than its previous pledge and far from a level necessary to 
combat climate change.  Noting China's "positive and responsible 
attitude" toward climate change, Qin said developed countries should 
take the lead and set a target of at least 40 percent emission 
reductions from 1990 levels.  Developed countries should also 
provide technical and capacity-building support to developing 
countries.  China took the issue of climate change seriously and 
would contribute to efforts to increase energy conservation and 
reduce emissions.  However, China was still a developing country 
whose present task was to develop its economy, eliminate poverty and 
raise the standard of living of its people.  Given this important 
task, an increase in China's emissions was "natural" and China's 
acceptance of binding or compulsory targets was not possible. 
 
Guantanamo Uighurs 
------------------ 
 
¶4.  Asked about reports that Palau would accept the 17 Uighur 
detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Qin said China was opposed to any 
third country accepting the Uighurs.  The Uighur terror suspects 
were members of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a group 
designated by the UN 1267 Committee as a terrorist organization. 
China urged the United States to abide by its international 
obligations on counterterrorism, stop handing over terrorists to 
third countries and expatriate the Uighurs to China. 
 
Visit of Afghan Foreign Minister Spanta 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Asked about Afghan Foreign Minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta's June 
 
BEIJING 00001579  002 OF 002 
 
 
10 visit to China, Qin noted the conclusion of an agreement on 
technical cooperation and highlighted "remarkable increases in 
bilateral trade and people-to-people exchanges."  China would 
continue to promote peaceful reconciliation and was willing to 
deepen its support for Afghanistan's reconstruction "within China's 
capabilities."  Qin described China and Afghanistan as "close 
neighbors" and noted that strong bilateral ties served the 
fundamental interests of both countries. 
 
China-India Relations 
--------------------- 
 
¶6.  Asked about reports in the Indian media of increasingly frequent 
Chinese military incursions into India, Qin said that China "cannot 
accept India's accusations."  Noting that China and India had not 
demarcated their border, Qin stated that resolving the border 
dispute was one of the ten strategies set by leaders of the two 
countries to develop bilateral relations.  China supported the "fair 
and respectful resolution of the border dispute."  China hoped that 
"relevant figures and press in India would take a responsible 
attitude to benefit bilateral relations." 
 
SCO Summit 
---------- 
 
¶7.  In response to a question on China's goals for the June 15-16 
SCO summit in Yekaterinburg, Qin stated that China hoped the summit 
would enhance mutual trust and boost security, economic and trade 
cooperation between member states.  He said that the current 
financial crisis had heightened the need for such cooperation. 
 
Visits

¶8.  Prime Minister of Grenada Tillman Thomas will visit China June 
15-21.
