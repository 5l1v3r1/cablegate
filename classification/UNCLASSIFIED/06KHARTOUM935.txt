SUBJECT: SUDAN - SUSPECTED AVIAN FLU OUTBREAK, Sitrep 1 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) WHO contacted USAID on April 18 to alert us to 
possible outbreak of avian flu in Sudan. Today a rapid 
test by the Government of Sudan on nasal secretions and 
serum from affected birds revealed Strain A flu. 
 
¶2. (SBU) A WHO outbreak investigation team is scheduled 
to arrive in Khartoum on April 19 equipped with a PCR 
machine that will be able to do immediate tests on site. 
Samples are also being sent to a laboratory in London. It 
will take about a week for confirmation from the London 
laboratory. 
 
¶3. (SBU) There have been heavy losses of poultry in the 
Khartoum area in the last few weeks. Some producers are 
said to have lost up to $500,000 and more as a result of 
the illness that has swept through the bird population, 
largely in Khartoum North. WHO reported to USAID that 
there are reports of avian deaths as far north as Shendi. 
 
¶4. (SBU) One suspected human case is hospitalized in 
Khartoum and under treatment with tamiflu. The patient, a 
35 year old man is reported to be responding well to 
treatment. 
 
¶5. (SBU) We hear that the Government of Sudan is planning 
to make press statements announcing avian flu, although 
WHO is more cautious publicly, wanting to wait for test 
results. Privately, they told USAID that this level of 
deaths indicates likely H5N1 virus. 
 
¶6. (SBU) In a meeting with USAID on April 18, WHO 
requested assistance from the US Government in support of 
the Ministry of Health efforts. Protective clothing and 
tamiflu doses are needed for 100 workers in the short 
term. WHO said 100 sets of PPE and 250 doses of tamiflu 
would be a good start. USAID believes that more PPE is 
needed given that PPE is usually used once and then 
discarded. REDSO/Nairobi's e-mail offer to send 300 sets 
immediately is timely and welcome.  WHO has also prepared 
a proposal to USAID for about $400,000 to support the 
Government's action plan that includes surveillance, 
detection and prevention/containment. A copy of the 
proposal is being forwarded to USAID/W. 
 
¶7. (U) USAID/Khartoum will commence numbered sitreps on 
the outbreak beginning with this one.
