Title- The never ending war 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (8-19) by Washington's 
correspondent Sergio Davila says:"...If there is one characteristic 
that differentiates Barack Obama from his predecessor.....it is the 
Democrat's healthy habit of telling the truth to the public - always 
when possible..... [When Obama said the Afghan war would not be easy 
or rapid] he should have also said that the second conflict [the 
first being the one in Iraq] cannot be won.  Fighting against Al 
Qaeda is like fighting the law of gravity.....If everything goes as 
the White House expects, [the current President Hamid] Karzai will 
win the [elections].......This would push Al Qaeda even more into 
neighboring Pakistan.  And this would then be the new chapter in the 
never ending war."
