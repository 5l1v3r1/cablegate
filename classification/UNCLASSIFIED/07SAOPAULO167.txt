SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary: In a speech at the new American Studies Center at 
the Armando Alvares Penteado Foundation (FAAP) in Sao Paulo February 
6, Under Secretary for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns 
highlighted common challenges and opportunities that Brazil and the 
U.S. face and called for strengthening our bilateral relations and 
common engagement in the hemisphere.  Questions from the respectful 
and largely academic audience touched on bilateral cooperation on 
biofuels (including the U.S. ethanol tariff), the environment, and 
regional issues.  On the margins of the FAAP event, U/S Burns also 
gave several media interviews that, as the speech itself, garnered 
ample and positive coverage.

SPEECH AT FAAP 
-------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Under Secretary Burns delivered a speech at the Armando 
Alvares Penteado Foundation (FAAP), a private university in Sao 
Paulo which is in the process of establishing an American Studies 
Program (reftel).  The speech, sponsored jointly by FAAP, ConGen Sao 
Paulo, AmCham, and the Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries 
(FIESP), was attended by approximately 250 guests, including 
students and faculty, and broadcast to FAAP campuses in Sao Jose dos 
Campos and Ribeirao Preto.  U/S Burns cited similarities between 
Brazil and the United States and the common challenges faced by the 
two countries in fighting organized crime and drug trafficking and 
other areas as well.  He called for strengthening bilateral 
relations and for partnering to promote investment in research and 
development on biofuels.  U/S Burns also discussed the "celebration 
of democracy" represented by the 13 elections held in the Western 
Hemisphere in 2006, and said the U.S was prepared to work with all 
democratically elected governments, including leftist governments. 
The text of U/S Burns's remarks can be found on the Department 
website at http://www.state.gov/p/us/rm as well as Embassy 
Brasilia's website at www.embaixadaamericana.org.br. 
 
¶3.  (U) Questions focused on bilateral cooperation on 
energy and environment, and on the prospects for the U.S. to open 
its market to ethanol imports.  U/S Burns praised Brazil's 
leadership in ethanol production and flex-fuel engine automobiles. 
He noted that Congress imposed the 54-cent per gallon 
surcharge/tariff on imported ethanol and was not likely to remove it 
in the near future.  The answer, he said, was to expand the global 
ethanol market.  One participant cited polls showing that Latin 
Americans are dissatisfied with democracy because the economies of 
the region have neither grown adequately over the past twenty years 
nor ended severe economic inequality, and that there is growing 
anti-American sentiment in the region.  U/S Burns agreed on the 
importance of economic growth and strengthening democracy, and 
acknowledged that sometimes U.S. policies and attitudes rub people 
the wrong way and contribute to anti-Americanism.  A/S Shannon 
described USG engagement in the OAS to address democracy, 
development, poverty, inequality, and social exclusion.

¶5. (U) Under Secretary Burns participated in several media events, 
including an exclusive interview with TV Globo and an on-the-record 
media roundtable that included top editors and correspondents from 
11 leading Brazilian and international print media such as AP, the 
Washington Post, Reuters and AFP.  His speech at FAAP was also open 
to the press and received ample coverage.  U/S Burns' remarks were 
the leading story on the front page of largest-circulation Brazilian 
daily "Folha de Sao Paulo," which titled its story, "The United 
States Wants a Strategic Partnership on Ethanol."  "O Estado de Sao 
Paulo," business dailies Valor Economico and Gazeta Mercantil, and 
the wire services AP and AFP also featured Burns' remarks on 
biofuels and Venezuela. The TV Globo interview aired on the 
nationally broadcast late night news, Jornal do Brasil.  The media 
also reported on his comments on USG views on Venezuela and Hugo 
Chavez. Radio Jovem Pan and the internet news portal Terra 
interviewed A/S Shannon; his comments on Venezuela were widely 
reported by the media. 
 
¶6. (U) This cable was coordinated with Embassy Brasilia and cleared 
by U/S Burns's delegation and Ambassador Sobel.
