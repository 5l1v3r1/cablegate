SUBJECT: WJEI IN SOUTH AFRICA (2) - ANNEXURES 
 
REF: PRETORIA 2378 
 
 
¶1.  This cable provides annexures to reftel cable, "WJEI IN 
SOUTH AFRICA: BUILDING ON SUCCESS." 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
              IV. "FINAL PROGRAM DESIGN" 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
¶2.  Per the format requested by the Department, the following 
sections summarize our conception of the South African WJEI 
program elements and activities going forward. 
 
- Strategic Priorities: assist women victims of sexual 
offenses; improve SAG capacity to curb violence against 
women; and build strong relationships with our South African 
partners in health and social services, law enforcement and 
the judiciary, and policymaking, leaving them with 
self-sustaining capabilities. 
 
- Potential Challenges: exceedingly high rates of crime, 
particularly but not only sexual offenses, taxing the 
capacity of all responders from medical and social workers to 
police, prosecutors, and judges; very high rates of HIV/AIDS, 
straining the social fabric and increasing the vulnerability 
of women and children to rape and sexual assault; limited 
institutional capacity of a 14-year-old democracy still 
transitioning from the apartheid era coping with shortages of 
skills and human capital; and competing funding priorities in 
a nation seeking to redress vast economic and social 
inequalities. 
 
--------------- 
Links to PEPFAR 
--------------- 
 
¶3.  Since there is a high correlation between HIV infection 
and sexual violence including rape, the President's Emergency 
Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) supports Thuthuzela Care 
Centers (TCCs) with funding.  In FY'06, PEPFAR provided 
assistance to SOCA to undertake an audit of the ten existing 
TCCs to ensure that in providing treatment to rape victims 
they comply with protocols, guidelines and regulations of the 
National Department of Health.  With FY'07 funding, PEPFAR 
provided support to establish seven additional TCCs.  PEPFAR 
will provide $2,085,000 in FY'08 and $2,085,000 again in 
FY'09 to the new contract to implement WJEI activities from 
FY'09-11.  In addition, the PEPFAR initiative on Sexual and 
Gender Based Violence (SGBV) shares with the WJEI the goal of 
"developing and implementing sexual violence service delivery 
models." Consequently, $166,000 will be obligated to the new 
WJEI contract from the PEPFAR SGBV fund. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Program Element 1: Victims' Support 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  This element involves assistance to victims of sexual 
violence, at the SAG's rape crisis centers. 
 
- Objective: to address the full range of medical, justice, 
and social needs of women victims of sexual violence. 
 
- Outputs to be measured: 
     - number of TCCs 
     - number of victims assisted 
     - number of TCC core staff trained 
 
- Desired outcome: 
     - end to secondary victimization 
     - reduced lead time to finalize cases 
     - higher conviction rates of perpetrators 
 
- Expected long term impact: increased number, improved 
quality, and expanded geographic scope of victims' assistance. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Program Element 2: Justice / Police Capacity Building 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶5. This element involves nationwide week-long training 
courses for SAPS detectives and first responders. 
 
- Objective: to improve police knowledge of legislation 
pertaining to sexual offenses; to impart effective techniques 
Qpertaining to sexual offenses; to impart effective techniques 
of securing crime scenes, collecting evidence, and 
 
PRETORIA 00002395  002 OF 005 
 
 
investigating cases; and to increase effectiveness and 
sensitivity in the interviewing of witnesses and victims. 
 
- Outputs to be measured: 
     - number of police detectives and first responders 
trained 
     - test score improvements vis-a-vis knowledge of sexual 
offenses 
     - higher rates of cases taken to court (not dismissed 
for poor evidence) 
     - higher conviction rates, in part due to strong case 
management 
 
- Desired outcomes: 
     - demonstrably enhanced capacity of South African law 
enforcement to investigate sexual violence, building solid 
and irrefutable case evidence for prosecution. 
     - improved coordination among ministries, in an 
integrated response to victims and violators. 
 
- Expected long term impact: 
     - improved crime scene management and evidence 
collection, enabling stronger prosecution potential (below), 
with its follow-on ripple effects on society 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Program Element 3: Justice / Prosecutors and Judges 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶6. This element entails national colloquia for judges and 
training courses for NPA prosecutors. 
 
- Objective: to improve knowledge among magistrates, judges, 
and prosecutors of new legislation pertaining to sexual 
offenses; to inform prosecutors on the particular nature of 
evidence in such cases, to assist their efficacy in the 
courtroom; and to encourage a very specialized sensitivity to 
rape victims' emotional states and distinctive behaviors, in 
order to elicit effective testimony without subjecting 
victims to a second traumatization. 
 
- Outputs to be measured: 
     - number of judge and prosecutor participants 
     - test score improvements vis-a-vis knowledge of sexual 
offenses 
     - percentage of cases resulting in conviction 
 
- Desired outcomes: 
     - demonstrably enhanced capacity of South African 
criminal justice to prosecute cases of sexual violence. 
     - higher conviction rates 
 
- Expected long term impact: 
     - more sensitive treatment of victims, and improved 
prosecution of perpetrators 
     - greater confidence of victims to press charges 
     - end to assumption of impunity among perpetrators 
     - long-term deterrence of sexual criminality 
     - greater security for women, empowering them through 
greater physical mobility

Political Section is unfamiliar.  The Political Section's 
spending to date on WJEI initiatives is limited to FY'08 
funds totaling approximately $244,400.

¶10.  On the INL/POL side, the Political Section estimates a 
need for FY'09 funding of $1.0 million from INL.  This figure 
is based on the aforementioned $244,400 spent this year to 
support about four months of recent training, plus the 
projected expansion in the number of students going forward. 
Funds of this amount are already at post, as described above, 
but they must be "unlocked" or re-obligated by INL to be 
applied to WJEI training.  The Political Counselor is 
meanwhile working to find economies by seeking a meeting with 
the SAG's new Minister of Safety and Security, Mr. Nathi 
Mthethwa, to negotiate the shifting of a greater share of the 
costs to the South African partners.  Post requests 
Department guidance on establishing a sustainable funding 
stream for INL-sponsored WJEI activities.
