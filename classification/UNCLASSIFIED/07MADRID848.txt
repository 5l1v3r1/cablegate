REF: STATE 56397 
 
¶1.  ESTHOFF made reftel points May 8 to Spanish IWC 
Commissioner Carmen Asencio, urging Spain to support U.S. IWC 
priorities.  Asencio said Spain would endorse the aboriginal 
subsistence whaling quota for Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Sea 
bowhead whales and agreed with the U.S. positions on the 
Revised Management Scheme and the mandate of the Conservation 
Committee. 
 
¶2.  Asencio said she feared that Japan's linkage of the 
U.S./Russian bowhead whale quota to Tokyo's request for a 
coastal whaling quota would paralyze the 2007 IWC meeting as 
it did in 2002, the last time a bowhead quota was considered. 
 She said she had been demarched by a Japanese Embassy 
official, but that Tokyo's approach had not changed Spain's 
views.  She also said that a New Zealand Embassy official had 
visited her and indicated that Wellington believed that the 
bowhead quota had the support of at least three quarters of 
the IWC member states and would thus be approved.
