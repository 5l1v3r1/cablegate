SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT INFORMATION ACT; HARARE 
 
 
¶1.  THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" FACES LEGAL 
ACTION AFTER ALLEGEDLY CONTRAVENING CERTAIN SECTIONS 
OF THE RECENTLY ENACTED ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND 
PROTECTION OF PRIVACY ACT.  ACCORDING TO FRONT-PAGE 
ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN THE MARCH 27 EDITIONS OF THE 
"DAILY NEWS" AND THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE 
HERALD," INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO HAS 
THREATENED TO BRING CHARGES AGAINST "DAILY NEWS" 
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF GEOFFREY NYAROTA FOR "CONTINUED 
MISREPRESENTATION."   MOYO SAYS THAT THE DAILY NEWS 
KNOWINGLY PUBLISHED A FALSE STORY IN ITS MARCH 22 
REPORT THAT THE JOINT AFRICAN CARIBBEAN PACIFIC- 
EUROPEAN UNION PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY PASSED A 
RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A RE-RUN OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 
POLL IN ZIMBABWE.  MOYO HAS ASKED THE PAPER TO MAKE A 
PUBLIC CORRECTION OF THE "DELIBERATE FALSEHOOD" OR 
FACE LEGAL ACTION IN TERMS OF THE ACCESS TO 
INFORMATION AND PROTECTION OF PRIVACY ACT.  THIS IS 
THE FIRST TIME THE CONTROVERSIAL ACT HAS BEEN INVOKED 
SINCE IT WAS ENACTED ON MARCH 15. 
 
¶2. IN RESPONSE TO MOYO'S LETTER, NYAROTA IS QUOTED IN 
A FRONT PAGE ARTICLE PUBLISHED IN THE MARCH 27 EDITION 
OF THE "DAILY NEWS" AS SAYING: "I WOULD RATHER GO TO 
JAIL, IF IT PLEASES THE HONORABLE MINISTER, THAN BE 
FORCED BY HIM TO PUBLICLY CORRECT A STORY THAT IS 100 
PERCENT CORRECT.  IF MOYO GENUINELY BELIEVES HE CAN 
INTIMIDATE 'THE DAILY NEWS' IN THIS MANNER THEN IT IS 
PATENTLY CLEAR HE FAILS COMPLETELY TO COMPREHEND HOW 
MUCH THE PAPER VALUES ITS INDEPENDENCE."
