SUBJECT: CZECH PARLIAMENT APPROVES MILITARY DEPLOYMENTS FOR 
2007 
 
REF: PRAGUE 1466 
 
¶1. On November 5th the Czech Chamber of Deputies approved a 
bill authorizing proposed foreign military deployments for 
2007 (Note: Reftel provided full details of the plan. End 
note). The legislation now goes to the President for 
signature. 
 
¶2. The bill approved by the lower chamber, and previous by 
the Senate, is unchanged from the government's draft 
proposal.  Troop limits are authorized for 2007 as follows: 
-- Iraq: 100 
-- Afghanistan: 225 
-- Balkans: 730  (to be divided between KFOR and ALTHEA) 
-- Lebanon: 10 
-- NATO Response Force: up to 400 troops in the period 
January 15 - June 15, 2007, and up to 35 troops in the period 
June 15 - January, 2008. 
 
¶3. The new, ten-member UNIFIL deployment was the only 
proposal to receive unanimous backing in the lower chamber. 
The Communist party voted against each of the other 
deployments.  However, each did receive full support from the 
mainstream parties on left and right. 
 
¶4. Comment: Further ad-hoc deployment bills will be possible 
in 2007 if the Czech Government decides to deploy additional 
personnel. Ministry of Defense sources confirm that Czech 
authorities are considering deploying medical personnel to 
Afghanistan in 2007 over and above the troop levels just 
authorized by Parliament. Post is seeking further information 
about this development. End comment.
