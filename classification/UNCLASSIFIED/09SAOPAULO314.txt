Title- Cuba, the memory and the future 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (5-27) by Clovis Rossi notes: 
"The Americas will have to deal with the Cuban ghost as of [June] 
2nd, during the Organization of American States [OAS] General 
Assembly, to take place in San Pedro Sula, Honduras.  Brazil is 
working with the wisest of the stances: it wants the meeting to 
revoke the 1962 resolution that suspended the Caribbean island from 
the Organization....the next step is...that Cuba stays in a 
transition phase for a while, able to accommodate two things: first, 
the direct and indirect dialogue between Cuba and the U.S.; second: 
the domestic situation in Cuba.....Alba countries want the 
re-integration [of Cuba in the OAS]...the U.S., Canada and some 
Caribbean countries are against it....Tackling this [sentimental] 
memory [of the subcontinent] in a final way is crucial for looking 
ahead and trying to place the relationship between Latin America and 
the U.S. at a more civilized and advantageous level." 
 
Title- Pyongyang's message 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (5-27) states: 
"....The question made by all the world....is what else major powers 
and the United Nations can do against a regime that is already 
isolated.  An armed solution is unthinkable.  What we have left is 
what [President Barack] Obama has proposed to Iran: to dialogue. 
And it is, in his own way, what [North Korean leader] Kim Jong-il 
also intends, 'as if he were to ask someone to marry him, with a gun 
pointed to her head,' a Japanese political scientist compared.  'But 
that's the way North Korea works.'"
