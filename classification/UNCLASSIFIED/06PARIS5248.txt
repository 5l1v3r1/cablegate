SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION REPORT - Israeli- Lebanese Crisis - 
Europeans Divided Cuba 
PARIS - Thursday, August 03, 2006 
 
 
(A) SUBJECTS COVERED IN TODAY'S REPORT: 
 
Israeli- Lebanese Crisis - Europeans Divided 
Cuba 
 
B) SUMMARY OF COVERAGE: 
 
Israel's military escalation in Lebanon is today's lead 
international story for Le Figaro and La Croix which concludes in a 
front page editorial: "Israel has always accumulated military 
successes, but has not really gained in security." In its editorial, 
Le Figaro analyzes France's "responsibilities" in Lebanon: "While 
France must assume its commitment to Lebanon's sovereignty, it must 
also take into account the refusal of other major military powers, 
such as the U.S., in participating in an international force..." 
France's position vis-`-vis Syria and Europe's divisions regarding 
an international force elicit several articles. In Liberation, one 
report contends that Spain's FM's trip to Damascus is "a slap in the 
face" for Chirac." (See Part C) 
 
Le Figaro interviews a Syrian Professor on Europe's (Spain and 
Germany) overtures towards Syria and France's stance: "Syria 
mistrusts France and its diplomatic approach in Lebanon, which is 
too close to the U.S. position, even if they differ about 
implementing an international force. Damascus believes that France 
and the U.S. share the same agenda and the same final objectives: to 
diminish Syria's regional influence." 
 
Le Monde interviews Jean-Marie Gueheno, the head of peacekeeping 
operations for the UN: "An international force can never impose 
peace from without. While we do not want to referee between the U.S. 
and French positions, the fact is that first we need for the 
fighting to stop..." 
 
For La Croix, "European governments are divided into those loyal to 
the American approach and those supporting a 'cleaner approach.' Le 
Parisien cites an anonymous diplomat as saying the five permanent 
members of the UNSC are warming up to the French three-prong 
proposal because no state wants to commit its troops to the 
"adventure." While Le Parisien looks favorably upon the U.S.'s 
"signs of impatience with its ally, Israel," it sees an end to 
hostilities as distant. The article ends with quotations that 
attribute responsibility for the conflict to Israel and President 
Bush. 
 
Le Figaro carries an op-ed by former President Jimmy Carter 
entitled: "Palliative Measures Not Enough for the Middle East." 
 
Le Monde's editorial, entitled "War of Images," does not believe 
that Israel can win the image war, although it will probably win the 
military one. (See Part C) 
 
The political situation in Cuba is today's second major 
international story. In Le Monde, correspondent Eric Lessser 
analyzes Washington's "wait and see" attitude while in Le Figaro one 
report is devoted to Washington's quandary about pursuing its 
embargo. (See Part C) 
 
(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
Israeli-Lebanese Crisis - Europeans Divided 
 
"France's Responsibility in Lebanon" 
Luc de Barochez in right-of-center Le Figaro (07/03): "While France 
must assume its historic commitment to Lebanon's sovereignty, it 
must also take into account the refusal of other major military 
powers, such as the U.S., in participating in an international 
force... This heavy responsibility demands that France's commitment 
be devoid all political calculations... FM Douste-Blazy's remarks 
about Iran, which elicited reactions from France's partners, have 
fortunately been clarified since... It is clear that Iran, in 
exchange for its involvement in resolving the crisis, expects 
concessions about its nuclear program. This of course is 
unacceptable... But France's conditions must not serve as an excuse 
to do nothing: we must find a compromise. Because if we wait for a 
distant and improbable peace between Hezbollah and Israel before 
sending an international force, the force's reason for being will 
already have lost much of its meaning." 
 
"Europe's Conditions to an International Force" 
Alexandrine Bouilhet in right-of-center Le Figaro (07/03):  "Because 
of France's objections, there will be no European soldier on the 
ground in Lebanon as long as a ceasefire and a political agreement 
have not been implemented." 
 
"A European Slap in the Face for Chirac" 
Christophe Boltansky in left-of-center Liberation (07/03): "Spain's 
FM's trip to Damascus to talk about the Lebanese crisis is a slap in 
the face for Chirac and Paris, which has tried to ostracize Syria as 
much as possible... Chirac, who appears as though he wants to get 
back to Syria for the assassination of his friend, Raffic Hariri, 
finds himself cheated by one of his partners... This latest Middle 
East crisis initially boosted Chirac's ratings. But it could turn 
into a trap. While Chirac was pushing for the implementation of 
resolution 1559..., he appears to be back-tracking. Could it be that 
he is afraid to appear to pro-American in the eyes of his 
compatriots and the Arab public?" 
 
"Israel's Conditions" 
Francois Ernenwein in Catholic La Croix (07/03): "Israel has 
launched a new wide-ranging ground operation... This new Middle East 
crisis underscores once again the impotence of diplomacy... due to 
divisions in the West... And so the fighting continues, exacerbating 
extremist reactions. By not acting, or by inadequate action, the 
major powers have once again let rancor take over. While 
historically Israel has always accumulated military successes, it 
has yet to gain in security." 
 
"There Is No Israeli-Lebanese War" 
National Assembly member Rudy Salles in Catholic La Croix (07/03): 
"Israel and Lebanon share neither a tradition of war, hateful 
relations, nor territorial conflict. Instead, Lebanon and Israel 
have one common enemy: terrorism... Israel's response was triggered 
by Hezbollah's missiles, with Syria and Iran's complicity... There 
should be less international blame against Israel: Israel should not 
have to do the 'dirty work' while others dance the dance of 
hypocrites." 
 
"War of Images" 
Left-of-center Le Monde in its unsigned editorial (07/03): "Israel's 
avowed goal is to disarm Hezbollah. Another goal acknowledged off 
camera by Israeli officials is to see Hezbollah 'come out of the war 
as the vanquished.' This last objective, the more modest of the two, 
has not been reached. What is also clear is that this war of images 
with the enemy, and the political war that will ensue if the 
military war remains undecided, will not be won by Israel... 
Hezbollah is improving its image in Lebanon and in the Arab-Muslim 
world, if only because it is resisting against the Israeli army... 
We cannot say whether Israel's military method will be successful. 
But it is politically disastrous... Still, Israel has little hopes 
of ever improving its image in the Middle East and in a large 
majority of the world... After 9/11 ... after America's fiasco in 
Iraq... the war in Lebanon has revived resentment against Israel, 
its American ally, and the West in general... The situation 
indicates the war is apt to continue. The future will tell who is 
the military winner; although there may be none. What is certain is 
that Lebanon will forgive Hezbollah for triggering the conflict, but 
it will not forgive Israel for Qana." 
 
Cuba 
 
"Washington Cautious While Preparing for a Post-Fidel Castro Cuba" 
Eric Lesser in left-of-center Le Monde (07/03): "The Bush 
administration has never hidden its eagerness to see the end of the 
Castro regime. But it is remaining cautious after the announcement 
about Fidel Castro's health: a stance which contrasts with Miami's 
Cuban refugees... American diplomacy has been preparing for the 
post-Castro era, hoping to implement a new regime after Fidel 
Castro... Such a regime change would undoubtedly be considered a 
victory for the Bush administration, which has hardened its position 
against Cuba by reinforcing the economic sanctions." STAPLETON
