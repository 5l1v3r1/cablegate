SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - SOMALIA 
 
¶1.  This Travel Warning updates information on the 
unsettled security situation and warns American 
citizens against travel to Somalia.  This 
supersedes the Travel Warning of May 20, 2008. 
¶2.  The Department of State warns U.S. citizens 
against all travel to Somalia, including the self- 
proclaimed "Republic of Somaliland," since there is 
no U.S. Embassy or other U.S. diplomatic presence 
in Somalia.  Consequently, the U.S. Government is 
not in a position to assist or effectively provide 
services to U.S. citizens in Somalia. 
¶3.  Terrorist operatives and armed groups in 
Somalia have demonstrated their intent and 
capability to attack air operations at Mogadishu 
International Airport.  Kidnapping, murder, illegal 
roadblocks, banditry, and other violent incidents 
and threats to U.S. citizens and other foreigners 
can occur in many regions.  Inter-clan and inter- 
factional fighting flares up with little or no 
warning.  Unpredictable armed conflicts among rival 
militias are prevalent in southern Somalia, 
particularly in and around Mogadishu, which has 
resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Somali 
nationals and the displacement of nearly one 
million people.  In December 2006, Ethiopian 
military forces entered Somalia in support of the 
Somali Transitional Federal Government.  The 
continuing Ethiopian military presence and support 
for the Transitional Federal Government has 
heightened tensions among rival political and clan 
factions within Somalia. 
¶4.  The Sanaag and Sool Regions in eastern 
Somaliland, bordering on Puntland (northeastern 
Somalia), are subject to insecurity due to ongoing 
border disputes and inter-clan fighting.  There 
also have been several fatal attacks and violent 
kidnappings against international relief workers, 
including Westerners, throughout Somalia, 
Somaliland, and Puntland.  Lines of control in 
Mogadishu are unclear and frequently shift, making 
movement within this area extremely hazardous. 
Violent riots have recently occurred in Mogadishu, 
as thousands of civilians protested rising food 
prices and the devaluation of the Somali currency. 
¶5.  Recently, insurgents and extremist elements 
opposed to the Somali government conducted hit-and- 
run attacks on several towns in central and 
southern Somalia, to include the districts of Gedo 
and Bay (especially the vicinity of Baidoa) in the 
south. 
¶6.  U.S. citizens also are urged to use extreme 
caution when sailing near the coast of Somalia. 
Merchant vessels, fishing boats, and recreational 
craft all risk seizure by pirates and having their 
crews held for ransom in the waters off the Horn of 
Africa, most especially in the international waters 
near Somalia.  There have been numerous such 
incidents, highlighting the continuing danger of 
maritime travel near the Horn of Africa.  If 
transit around the Horn of Africa is necessary, it 
is strongly recommended that vessels travel in 
convoys, and maintain good communications contact 
at all times. 
¶7.  U.S. citizens who travel to Somalia despite 
this Travel Warning are urged to register through 
the State Department's travel registration website, 
https://travelregistration.state.gov and obtain 
updated information on travel and security from the 
U.S. Embassies in neighboring countries.  Travelers 
to the self-declared "Republic of Somaliland" 
should register with the U.S. Embassy in Djibouti, 
and travelers to Puntland or southern Somalia 
 
STATE 00113913  002 OF 002 
 
 
should register with the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. 
¶8.  The U.S. Embassy in Djibouti is located at 
Plateau du Serpent, Boulevard Marechal Joffre, 
Djibouti City; telephone (253) 35-39-95; after- 
hours telephone number (253) 35-13-43.  The mailing 
address is Ambassade Americaine, B.P. 185, 
Djibouti, Republique de Djibouti, and their 
workweek is Sunday through Thursday.  The U.S. 
Embassy in Nairobi is located on United Nations 
Avenue, Gigiri, Nairobi, Kenya; telephone (254)(20) 
363-6000; after-hours emergencies (254)(20) 363- 
¶6170.  The mailing address is P.O. Box 606 Village 
Market 00621, Nairobi, Kenya. 
¶9.  U.S. citizens should also consult the 
Department of State's Country Specific Information 
for Somalia and the Worldwide Caution, which are 
located on the Department's internet website at 
http://travel.state.gov.  American citizens may 
obtain up-to-date information on security 
conditions by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in 
the United States and Canada, or 202-501-4444 from 
overseas.
