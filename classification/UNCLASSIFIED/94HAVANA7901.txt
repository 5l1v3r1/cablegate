SUBJECT:      CUBA:  1994 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 286744 
 
Â¶1.  AS REQUESTED, BELOW ARE RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS 
LISTED IN REFTEL PARA 3: 
 
(A)  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING 
     INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT 
     DURING 1994.  THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT SUBMITTED 
     DIPLOMATIC NOTES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN FEBRUARY 
     AND MAY 1994 PROTESTING THE ALLEGED "IMPUNITY" WITH 
     WHICH ANTI-CUBA TERRORIST GROUPS ARE PERMITTED TO 
     OPERATE IN U.S. TERRITORY. 
 
(B)  POST HAS NO INFORMATION REGARDING ANY EXTRADITION, 
     OR REQUEST FOR EXTRADITION, TO CUBA OF SUSPECTED 
     TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
(C)  CLOSE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN CUBA AND OTHER 
     COUNTRIES WHICH SPONSOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
     COULD IMPEDE CUBAN GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR 
     EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
(D)  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER CUBAN GOVERNMENT 
     ACTIONS TO CONDEMN OR INVESTIGATE TERRORIST ACTS. 
(E)  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM 
     EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1994 BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
(F)  CUBAN GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL 
     TERRORISM HAS DECLINED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL 
     YEARS.  THE EVER DEEPENING ECONOMIC CRISIS FACING 
     CUBA HAS REDUCED THE RESOURCES PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE 
     TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  AT 
     THE SAME TIME, THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT'S EFFORT TO WIN 
     BOTH INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SUPPORT AND FOREIGN 
     INVESTMENT HAS RESULTED IN DIMINISHED SUPPORT FOR 
     INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  CUBA, HOWEVER, CONTINUES 
     TO MAINTAIN STRONG DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH IRAN, IRAQ, 
     LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, AND SYRIA.  BEYOND THE GROUP OF 
     BASQUE TERRORISTS WHO SOUGHT REFUGE IN CUBA SEVERAL 
     YEARS AGO, POST HAS NO NEW INFORMATION REGARDING 
     TERRORISTS HARBORED IN CUBA. 
 
(G)  THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED PRESS IS CAREFUL TO AVOID 
     ANY EXPLICIT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. 
 
(H)  POST SEES NO CHANGE FROM 1993 IN THE CUBAN 
     GOVERNMENT POSITION REGARDING TERRORISM.
