Per reftel instructions, Poloff contacted Spanish MFA Deputy 
Director General for the United Nations, Juan Manuel Gonzalez 
de Linares, to remind the Spanish of their previous 
commitment to vote for Judge Buergenthal in the ICJ elections 
on November 7, and to thank them for their support. Gonzalez 
de Linares confirmed that Spain intended to support 
Buergenthal, as Foreign Minister Moratinos told Secretary 
Rice in a recent meeting, and hoped that the US would support 
Spain's candidate as well, Professor Julio Gonzalez Campos. 
He pointed out that like Buergenthal, Gonzalez Campos has 
received the backing of most of the Security Council and 
General Assembly. He said that though the Spanish know that 
the US generally does not usually announce much in advance 
what candidates it will support for elections of this sort, 
Spain hoped the US would consider such an announcement now, 
just a month before the elections, to ensure the success of 
Gonzalez Campos's candidature.
