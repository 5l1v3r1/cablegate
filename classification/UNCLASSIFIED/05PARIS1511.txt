On February 25 reftel points were delivered to the MFA office 
for Strategic Affairs, Security and Disarmament and to the 
MFA regional office responsible for Russia and the Former 
Soviet Space.  On March 7 poloff spoke with Jean-Francois 
Guillaume, MFA Action Officer for SA/LW who said that France 
recognizes the urgent need to diminish the massive stockpiles 
of SA/LW that exist in Ukraine.  He added that he was sure a 
French delegate would attend the March 11 ad hoc Working 
Group meeting in Brussels though he did not know who the 
delegate would be.  Guillaume said that France's main concern 
is with aging munitions, which he said pose the greatest 
threat among Ukraine's SA/LW stockpiles, and that France will 
be working within the context of the European Common Action 
Plan to put in place projects aimed at destroying munitions 
stockpiles.  He said that France is very much in favor of 
taking action and will coordinate with its European partners 
adding that he could not yet predict the amount of aid that 
will be set aside for SA/LW destruction.
