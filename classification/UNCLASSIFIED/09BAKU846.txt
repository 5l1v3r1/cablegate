SUBJECT: READOUT OF BAKU BSEC MEETING 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY: Azerbaijan hosted the Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation Forum October 20-22.  This was Azerbaijan's last 
act as chair of the BSEC, as the baton was then passed to 
Bulgaria.  Highlights included appearances by Turkish FM 
Davutoglu and Armenian DFM Kirakossian.  Both of their 
appearances were without incident.  Three Memorandums were 
postponed to the next meeting, one between BSEC and the 
Central European Initiative ) Executive Secretariat, the 
second between BSEC and the Danube Commission, and the third 
between BSEC and the United States.  End Summary. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Turkish FM and Armenian DFM in the Spotlight 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (in town to 
repair Turkey-Azerbaijan relations in the wake of the 
Turkey-Armenia rapprochement) made an appearance at the BSEC 
meetings and said that Turkey wanted to see more effort and 
cooperation at BSEC, and for the BSEC to be made more 
efficient.  Armenian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Arman 
Kirakossian repeatedly thanked Azerbaijan for organizing the 
meeting, and encouraged cooperation among BSEC countries. 
Davutoglu and Kirakossian's participation took the spotlight, 
and evening news coverage was devoted solely to the two. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
From Each Nation, A Different Viewpoint 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Many delegates emphasized their determination to make the 
BSEC more efficient and effective.  Turkey, Moldova, Albania, 
Georgia, Greece, and Romania supported the BSEC 
transportation initiatives.  The representatives from Ukraine 
repeatedly mentioned the need for efficiency and 
effectiveness within the BSEC.  Climate change was only 
mentioned by the Greek representative.  The Russian 
representative complained that observer countries were not 
doing enough to support BSEC. 
 
¶4.  Georgian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs David 
Jalagania complained that the Russia Federation is not in 
compliance with BSEC rules.  He said Russia has closed its 
borders with Georgia, and is occupying Georgian territory. 
He noted that through  hard work and the help of the USG, 
Georgia has persevered despite Russia's actions.  Finally, he 
also emphasized the importance of the Nabucco pipeline. 
 
¶5.  Polish Ambassador to Baku Krzysztof Krajewski stated that 
BSEC was important to his country, and that Poland supports 
creating stronger ties between Eastern and Southeastern 
European countries and the EU. 
 
 
------------------------------------- 
Memorandums Postponed to Next Meeting 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  The Memorandum of Intent between the USG and BSEC on 
Science and Technology was postponed until the next meeting. 
Two MOUs were discussed, but neither was passed: the 
Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation between BSEC and 
the Central European Initiative ) Executive Secretariat 
(MUCP), and the Memorandum of Understanding of Sectorial 
Dialogue Partnership between the Danube Commission and the 
Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization (MUSD). 
 
¶7.  Ukraine and a few other countries were disappointed with 
the lack of action on MUCP, while Russia wanted to continue 
with discussions and further changes.  A drafting committee 
will be organized to re-write MUCP and the new memorandum 
will be discussed at the next meeting.  A disagreement 
between Russia and Turkey prevented passage of the MUSD; the 
Turks insisted on using the word "safety" with regard to 
transportation while Russia wanted the word deleted.  Russia 
also insisted on replacing "enter into force" with weaker 
language. 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Side Commentary from the EU Representative 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶8.  Finally, the EU representative told Poloff that he does 
not like dealing with BSEC because of its inaction, but 
rather he prefers to act with smaller groups of interested 
countries on each issue.  He also noted that Russia has told 
him to work directly with the BSEC, but that in BSEC meetings 
the Russian delegates block many of the memorandums, and he 
said "this was a very strange contradiction."
