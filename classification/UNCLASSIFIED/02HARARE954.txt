SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT ANOTHER EDITOR ARRESTED; HARARE 
 
 
Police in Harare on April 17 summoned Iden Wetherell, 
editor of the weekly "Zimbabwe Independent," for 
questioning over allegations of contravening the newly 
enacted Access to Information and Protection of Privacy 
Act.  He was released on the same day.  Wetherell's summons 
come hard on the heels of similar charges this week against 
Goeff Nyarota, Editor-in-Chief of the independent daily 
"The Daily News," and "Zimbabwe Independent" Chief reporter 
Dumisani Muleya.  Wetherell and Muleya are being jointly 
charged for publishing a "false story" linking First Lady 
Grace Mugabe with a labour dispute involving her brother at 
a local herbal company.  Nyarota was this week charged in 
connection with a story that accused the Registrar- 
General's office of manipulating the March presidential 
poll results in favor of ZANU PF's presidential candidate 
Robert Mugabe.
