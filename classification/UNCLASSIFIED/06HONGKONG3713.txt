SANTEK COMPANY LTD. 
 
REF: A) USDOC 01595 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Export Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of 
Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control Officer 
Philip Ankel (ECO) and Special Agent (SA) John McKenna 
conducted a Post Shipment Verification (PSV) at Santek 
Company Ltd. (Santek Hong Kong), Flat E, 9F, Block 2, 
Tsui Lai Garden, Sheung Shui, Hong Kong. This PSV 
 
SIPDIS 
concerned two KD-300 probes valued at USD 2,235 
classified under ECCN 2B006.  ECCN 2B006 items are 
controlled for national security (NS) and anti- 
terrorism (AT) reasons and may be controlled for 
nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons. The exporter is 
MTI Instruments of Albany, N.Y. 
 
¶3.  On August 22, the ECO and SA McKenna visited Santek 
Hong Kong at the address above.  The ECO and SA met 
with Emily Yen, Santek's representative in Hong Kong 
for the past four years. Ms. Yen was open and 
cooperative and stated that Santek Hong Kong operates 
as an importer for goods into Hong Kong that are then 
transshipped to the parent company (Santek) in China 
(Santek China).  Ms. Yen deals primarily with Santek's 
office in Shenzhen. 
 
¶4. Ms. Yen further stated that Santek China handles all 
necessary paperwork for ordering items from the United 
States, to include providing the documentation required 
to obtain appropriate U.S. export authorizations. 
 
¶5. Ms. Yen informed the ECO and SA McKenna that all 
items shipped from the United States that are ordered 
by Santek China for delivery to Santek Hong Kong are 
forwarded on to Santek China.  Ms. Yen also informed 
the ECO and SA McKenna that part of the reason 
transactions are handled in this manner is that it is 
easier for the items to be sent to Hong Kong before 
being forwarded on to China.  This is, in part, because 
it is sometimes difficult to obtain export licenses for 
them. 
 
¶6.  Ms. Yen indicated that Santek only sells to 
Universities and that she was not familiar with the 
commodities that were the subject of this PSV. Ms. Yen 
was also not aware of the end-use of the applicable 
items. 
 
¶7. Ms. Yen provided copies of the purchase order and 
invoice related to the sale of two KD-300 probes to 
Hanin Industrial University in China that are the 
subject of this PSV.  She provided an additional MTI 
invoice (number 0960543 dated August 16, 2006) 
reflecting shipment of an additional two KD-300 probes 
on August 16, 2006. The invoice further states that the 
ECCN of these items is 2B006 and the customer is 
Tsinghua University.  Ms. Yen stated that she did not 
 
SIPDIS 
engage in a dialogue with anyone from MTI concerning 
the above sale, or any other sale made to Santek by MTI 
since all paperwork, to include sales and forwarding 
arrangements, are handled by Santek China. 
 
¶8. Ms. Yen stated that the only other US firm from 
which Santek China makes purchases is a firm based in 
New Jersey doing business as Banner (a "Banner" logo is 
located on the Santek China web page:  santek.com.cn). 
She also stated that the arrangement to receive 
commodities ordered by Santek from Banner was the same 
as with MTI meaning that Santek China handled the 
ordering and shipping and the items would then be sent 
to Santek Hong Kong for forwarding to China. 
 
¶9.  Given the information currently available to the 
ECO and given that the primary role that Santek Hong 
Kong serves is to move US origin goods to China from 
Hong Kong, this ECO recommends that this PSV be 
categorized as unfavorable.
