In Today's Papers 
 
New Photos from Abu Ghraib 
All papers:  An Australian TV broadcasted new photographs 
and video clips from Abu Ghraib.  Reportedly, these photos 
were the unpublished images of the abuse of Iraqis by the US 
military at Abu Ghraib prison which were taken in late 2003. 
The tone of the reporting highlights that the torture was 
systematic and despite evidence no high ranking officials 
have been punished yet. 
 
Turkey Gets Tough on Iran; US Ambassador Schulte in Ankara 
Radikal, Hurriyet, Zaman and Yeni Safak:  The Turkish 
Foreign Ministry decided to get tougher on its statements 
related to Iran's nuclear program.  The Foreign Ministry 
stated that Iran was hiding information and failed to win 
the trust of the international community.  Papers note that 
comments come just ahead of meetings in Ankara today and 
tomorrow with US Permanent Representative to the IAEA 
Gregory Schulte. 
 
Murat Yetkin commenting in Radikal says focus on the Iranian 
issue increased especially after the visit of German FM and 
leading up to the meetings in Ankara of US Representative to 
the IAEA, Greg Schulte.  Yetkin, reading between the lines 
of the latest statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry, 
believes Ankara's message to Tehran was a "warning not to 
provide any pretext to the US for a strike against Iran." He 
continues, "an operation against Iran will not be like the 
Iraq operation, rather it is likely that a series of 
unprecedented air strikes will be carried out to cut off 
Iran's nuclear capability for at least another decade." 
 
Iraq and the Region 
Aksam, Yeni Safak: Highlighting a trade fair to be held in 
Jordan, papers talk about an economic "competition war" as 
Turkey and many countries in the region are going to 
participate in re-constructing Iraq by bidding at the fair 
in Amman on May 8-11. 
 
In a Sabah, Soli Ozel comments on the importance of 
establishing a national identity in Iraq, saying that the 
Kurds will play a crucial role. Ozel writes, "There is 
potential tension ahead between secular Kurds and pro- 
Islamist Arab parties.  Therefore, the stance of the Kurds 
is very important for the future shape of Iraq." Ozel 
concludes, "It is in the interest of everyone -- including 
Turkey, the US and the countries in the region -- to 
preserve the territorial integrity of Iraq and convince 
Kurds to remain a part of an integrated Iraq," urging Turkey 
to make this fact "an essential pillar of its Iraq policy." 
 
Turkish Press Covers US Reaction to the 'Valley of the 
Wolves-Iraq' 
Hurriyet, Yeni Safak, Vatan:  American media continues to 
pay attention to the Turkish movie, Valley of the Wolves- 
Iraq.  American ABC TV criticized the box office success of 
the film in Turkey calling it a "victory of Anti- 
Americanism."  The Washington Times carried a story 
criticizing the wife of the Turkish PM, wondering "how Turs 
would like it if Laura Bush watched the movie 'Midnight 
Express' and praised it afterwards" As the Turkish PM's wife 
did in the case of "Valley of the Wolves, Iraq." 
 
Pentagon's "Long War" Strategy 
Milliyet: The Pentagon designed a new war strategy based on 
a longstanding war against terrorist networks and rouge 
states.  Worried about the strategy turning into a cold war-

like atmosphere, the Democrats and liberal media as well as 
some conservative circles have started a debate on the 
Pentagon's assessment, focusing on the disadvantages. 
 
US Security Blacklist 
Radikal, Yeni Safak, Sabah: US Center for Counterterrorism 
has broadened its list of potential suspects.  Collecting 
names from CIA, FBI, Homeland Security and other relevant 
agencies, the list now contains 325,000 names, mostly 
foreigners.  Papers took excerpts from a Washington Post 
story and highlighted that most of the names listed might 
even be innocent people. 
 
Turkish Parliament Rejects Censure Motion Against Finance 
Minister Unakitan 
All papers:  Turkish Parliament rejected a censure motion 
submitted by the main opposition Republican People's Party 
(CHP) against Finance Minister Unakitan.  The motion 
submitted against Unakitan was for abusing his power in the 
Galataport tender, asset declaration and bank accounts, 
corruption in tenders, violating commercial and banking 
confidentiality rules, defaming other persons and

institutions and for causing state losses. 
 
Television

establish a nuclear power plant.  Reportedly the National 
Security Council will pick a place among seven different 
areas, to build the plant.
