RESET 
 
¶1.  The U.S. Navy Cruiser USS COWPENS made its contribution in 
the resetting of U.S.-Russia relations during a May 7-11 ship 
visit to Vladivostok.  The visit was the first to Vladivostok 
since May of last year and marks the resumption of a tradition 
interrupted last July after a planned visit was canceled because 
of a logistical disagreement. The Georgian conflict suspended 
other mil to mil activities. American sailors from the ship 
participated in a number of community relations events, while 
officers from the ship and ConGen Vladivostok took part in 
official meetings. 
 
¶2.  Ship Commander Holly Graf made several official calls, 
including meetings with Vladivostok Mayor Pushkaryov and Deputy 
Russian Pacific Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Nikolay Maryasov. 
The Commander also hosted a dinner on board the ship for local 
naval officers and laid a ceremonial flower garland at the 
Russian Pacific Fleet Battle Honors Memorial.  Commander Graf 
and the Consulate hosted a reception on the ship. 
 
¶3.  Sailors took part in several community relations events. 
The ship fielded soccer and basketball teams to take on students 
from various Vladivostok universities, while other sailors 
participated in a skating session at the local ice rink. 
Additionally, sailors and officers visited the Sedanka Veterans 
Center, where Captain Holly Graf and others planted trees in the 
garden and painted fences.  Sedanka is home to surviving World 
War Two Soviet veterans who are especially appreciative of the 
opportunity to meet with American sailors who reciprocated the 
respect and enjoyment.  They also visited the Mayak Children's 
Center, where sailors played with the children, made renovations 
to the facility, and presented gifts.  Later, veterans, Russian 
Pacific Fleet sailors, regional officials and a group from the 
Mayak Children's Center toured the cruiser. 
 
¶4.  Comment.  The visit of the USS COWPENS was an excellent 
opportunity for the Russian public to interact with Americans. 
Ship visits help dispel negative stereotypes and are a great 
example of transformational diplomacy as many sailors take to 
the streets in uniform, meeting with Russians and representing 
America extremely well.  The visits were covered extensively in 
the media, and public interest was high.  Many officials 
expressed hope that the tradition, especially on Victory Day, 
will continue.  The visits offer us an opportunity to segue from 
our shared success in defeating fascism to our shared interests 
today.   ConGen Vladivostok strongly supports these ship visits 
and looks forward to further outreach opportunities with Embassy 
Moscow's support during the upcoming Independence Day ship visit.
