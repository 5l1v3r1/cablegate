SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN PROGRAM ANNUAL UPDATE 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 205022 
     ¶B. 03 QUITO 1058 
 
¶1.  In response to Ref A, Post provides the following 
information on its Blue Lantern program: 
 
-- Principal Point of Contact:  Political Officer Gregory 
Macris 
 
-- Telephone: 593-2-256-2890, ext 4409 
 
-- Fax: 593-2-254-0712 
 
-- Email:  macrisgp@state.gov (unclass); 
macrisgp@state.sgov.gov (classified) 
 
-- Estimated Departure Date:  7/2005 
 
¶2.  Due to Ecuador's proximity to Colombia and its historic 
role as a transit point for both northbound weapons and 
southbound narcotics, Post takes seriously its Blue Lantern 
(BL) responsibilities.  Most BL requests cover firearm and 
ammunition imports - Ref B outlines weapons licensing 
procedures in Ecuador.  Upon receipt of a BL telegram, Post 
conducts, at a minimum, the following namechecks on end users 
and middlemen: 
 
--  Regional Security Office (RSO) verifications 
 
--  Regional Affairs Office (RA) verifications 
 
--  Foreign Commercial Service (FCS) verifications 
 
¶3.  In addition, Post often verifies buyer bona fides with 
Ecuador's licensing office, a part of the military joint 
command, and requests assistance from local police to conduct 
site visits.  Emboffs endeavor to visit personally sites in 
the Quito area; when funds (and time) allow, they will travel 
to outlying areas.  The Front Office takes an active role in 
ensuring the accuracy and timeliness of Blue Lantern checks.
