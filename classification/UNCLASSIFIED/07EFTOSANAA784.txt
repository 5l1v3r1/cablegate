REF: A. FRANCESCHI-KHOURY EMAIL OF 4/27/07 
     ¶B. SANAA 414 
 
¶1. (U)  Per ref A instruction, post delivered to the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and the President's Office the text of the 
letter found at paragraph two from President Bush to 
President Saleh regarding Saleh's requests for assistance in 
relation to the conflict in Saada on April 28 (ref B). 
 
¶2. (U)  Begin text of letter from President Bush to President 
Saleh: 
 
Dear Mr. President: 
 
Thank you for your letter.  I have been following the ongoing 
conflict in Yemen and recognize the challenges that this 
situation presents to your government.  The United States has 
long supported the strengthening of Yemen s security and 
counterterrorism capabilities.  Our three-pronged assistance 
program focuses on developing the Yemeni Counterterrorism 
Unit and Special Operations Forces, building up your Coast 
Guard, and improving Yemen s military capacity.  In 2006, 
U.S. assistance totaled over $10 million.  The United States 
intends to maintain, if not surpass, this level in 2007. 
 
Let me also affirm that the United States supports, in 
principle, your requests to neighboring countries regarding 
excess U.S.-origin equipment and has pledged to facilitate 
approval of these transfers as expeditiously as possible when 
and if agreed to by your neighbors. 
 
I look forward to welcoming you back to the White House in 
May to discuss this and other issues in greater detail. 
 
Sincerely, 
George W. Bush
