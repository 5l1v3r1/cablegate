  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  U.S.-ISRAEL 
 
"U.S. reassuring Israel" 
 
The Beijing-based newspaper sponsored by official intellectual 
publication Guangming Daily and Guangdong Provincial official 
publication Nanfang Daily The Beijing News (Xin Jing 
Bao)(10/22)(page A28): "Zhu Zhaoyi, an expert on Israeli issues, 
said that the background to the [U.S.-Israel military] exercise is 
the Iran nuclear issue.  The joint military exercise is meant to 
reassure Israel and show that the U.S. is still committed to 
protecting its security.  At the same time, the U.S. wants to put 
further pressure on Iran, and both the U.S. and Israel hope to deter 
Syria and Hezbollah through the military exercise.  This then can 
improve the deterioration in Israel's external strategic environment 
and ease pressures on Israel." 
 
¶2.  "G2" 
 
"The G2 is not the new international order advocated by China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(10/22)(page 14): "China will not agree to the 
G2 idea for the following reasons.  First, although cooperation 
between the U.S. and China has a deep foundation, bilateral 
differences, such as human rights and Taiwan, cannot be quickly 
removed.  Second, China's national strength is far behind the 
U.S.'s.  Under the circumstances, even if China and the U.S. 
established a G2, China would ultimately discover that it had gained 
nothing from its investment.  Third, considering the many different 
interests of the world's economies, one to two countries or 
international organizations cannot solve global issues.  After all, 
the G2 would ultimately be about more than just enhanced cooperation 
between the U.S. and China in international affairs.  Fourth, it is 
questionable whether or not the U.S. really wants to share 
leadership with China.  Sharing leadership with the U.S. also does 
not meet the basic diplomatic policy of China, which is still in the 
primary phase of its development.  China has no intention to seek 
hegemony.  To conclude, China should approach its relations with the 
U.S., the EU, Japan, Russia, and other big countries properly, 
respecting multilateralism in the international system and avoiding 
joint governance between the U.S. and China." 
 
¶3.  U.S. POLICY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
 
"The U.S. is accelerating its return to Southeast Asia" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao)(10/22)(page 8): "President Obama will attend the APEC summit 
next month in Singapore and meet the leaders of the seven ASEAN 
members.  This is yet another step by the U.S. to accelerate its 
return to Southeast Asia.  ASEAN has always been the traditional way 
the U.S. exerted influence in the region on issues of concern to its 
political, economic and security interests.  To accelerate its 
return to Southeast Asia, the U.S. has been actively promoting a 
bilateral summit with ASEAN this year.  Simon Tay, Chairman of the 
Singapore Institute of International Affairs, argued that Obama's 
policy of deepening U.S. engagement with the region is welcome.  It 
is necessary for great powers, including China, to maintain a 
healthy relationship with ASEAN which will help maintain ASEAN's 
role as a hub in the wider Asia region."
