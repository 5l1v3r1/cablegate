SUBJECT:  National Assembly Calls for Non-Renewal of UPDF Military 
Protocol 
 
¶1.  On November 22, the National Assembly approved a resolution 
calling for the non-renewal of the protocol with the Ugandan 
People's Defense Force (UPDF) in Sudan.  The original agreement, 
signed in March 2002, permitted the UPDF to operate in limited 
portions of Southern Sudan against the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). 
 Although a review was scheduled for April 2006, ongoing peace talks 
between the UPDF and LRA sidelined further discussion. 
 
¶2.  The bill also recommended that Joint Integrated Units (JIUs), 
comprising Sudan Armed Forces and SPLA troops, be charged with 
guarding the nation's Southern borders.  Finally, the resolution 
called on the Ministry of Defense to submit a plan for improving 
Sudanese defense capabilities to the National Assembly. 
 
¶3.  Comment:  this development follows Ugandan President Museveni's 
recent ordering of the UPDF to pull back from some of its bases in 
Southern Sudan.
