Â¶1.  Post has coordinated with the Embassy of Japan in Madrid 
and determined that Spain intends to follow through on its 
pledge to support Pakistan made during the Tokyo Donor 
Conference.  The Spanish MFA noted that the participation of 
Deputy Foreign Minister Angel Lossada at the Tokyo Conference 
reflected their deep commitment to Pakistan.  The MFA could 
not share specific information about the timing of Spain's 
disbursements, but Post notes that pledges for other 
international donor efforts have typically been processed at 
the end of the calendar year.  The Spanish MFA also warned 
that since its contributions would be processed through UNDP, 
that there might be delays related to UNDP implementation.
