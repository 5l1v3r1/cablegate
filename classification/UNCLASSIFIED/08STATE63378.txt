Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 050104685 for the export of

to establish the bona fides of unfamiliar end-user Europa Arm 
Sport. 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to establish the bona 
fides of the end-user by making appropriate inquires to 
representatives of Europa Arm Sport. The following questions 
have been included for guidance: 
 
--When was the company established and who are its principals? 
 
--What types of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located?  Does the company have 
an established customer base? 
 
--Does the company keep proper, detailed records of its sales 
and customers? 
 
--Will the company be handling or storing the items listed on 
the application?  If so, does it have secure facilities and 
proper security procedures for handling these USML items? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information
