"A Dictator Under Construction" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. 
Paulo (5/25) editorialized: "Another tough blow against 
the right of choice, pluralism of ideas and freedom of 
speech will be struck this Sunday in Venezuela. RCTV, 
the oldest and one of the most popular television networks 
in that nation will no longer exist after President Hugo 
Ch vez refused to renew its license. Therefore, the last 
national television station that followed an independent 
line in relation to the government will die.... 
[As a result] the Venezuelan president will have in 
practice eliminated the possibility of his administration 
being questioned or criticized on any program with national 
range.... Step by step, in a slow but unequivocal way, Ch vez 
is continuing his escalation towards authoritarianism, and 
is eroding with determination the system of checks and 
balances that provides oxygen to democratic societies and 
imposes limits on every megalomaniac leader. Cooptation or 
intimidation of political adversaries, the direct or biased 
control over the media and the free flow of information - 
this is just one of Ch vez's means. His work - a true 
dictatorship in progress - becomes clearer in the light of 
the institutional maneuvers and the changes already carried 
out or still being effected within Venezuela's legal 
framework. Without any public debate, another change in the 
Constitution has been secretly prepared.... The new 
Constitution will provide the president indefinite reelection.... 
Ch vez's power lies in the volatile prosperity made possible 
by the high oil prices in international markets. The basis on 
which the insanity of this dictator under construction lies 
is murky and slippery, as oil is."
