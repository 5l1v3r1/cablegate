SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON UNSCR 1803 (IRAN SANCTIONS) DELIVERED 
 
REF: SECSTATE 48615 
 
On May 8, Emboff presented reftel concerns regarding 
implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 
(UNSCR) 1803 on Iran Sanctions to Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Under Secretary for the United Nations, International 
Organizations and International Law Section Mani Bhattarai. 
Emboff urged the Government of Nepal (GON) to submit a report 
to the UNSCR 1737 Sanctions Committee on steps it has taken 
to implement UNSCR 1803 and presented the text of the U.S. 
report.  Bhattarai appreciated receiving a copy of the U.S. 
report, but was non-committal about whether the GON would 
submit one of its own.
