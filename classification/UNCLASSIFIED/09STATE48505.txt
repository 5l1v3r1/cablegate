¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests the assistance of Embassy 
Algiers and Embassy Paris in conducting a post-shipment check 
on license 050128000 for the export of U.S. fiber optic 
inverters to France for integration into night vision devices 
(NVDs) for Algeria.  Posts are requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a 
Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: sensitivity of commodity and 
complexity of transaction. 
 
¶4. ACTION ALGIERS: Embassy is requested to make inquiries 
with appropriate host government officials to confirm the 
Algerian MoD (AGMOD) order of NVDs from Thales.  Post should 
also inform AGMOD that, due to significant U.S. content in 
the devices, they are subject to re-export and retransfer 
restrictions of the U.S. International Traffic in Arms 
Regulations (ITAR). 
 
¶5. ACTION PARIS: Embassy is requested to make inquiries with 
Photonis SAS to confirm that all the fiber optic inverters 
supplied by U.S. applicant Schott North America, Inc. to 
Photonis SAS are to be integrated into image intensifier 
tubes and supplied to Thales for ultimate end-use by the 
AGMOD.  Export data indicates that items worth $33,000 
shipped from the United States on January 8, 2009 and items 
worth $56,100 shipped from the U.S. on January 16, 2009.
