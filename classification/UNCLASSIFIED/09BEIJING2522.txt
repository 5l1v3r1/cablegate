¶1.  SIX PARTY TALKS 
 
"What if the Six-Party Talks completely fail? (pg 14)" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/02): "There are several possible outcomes 
If all the parties involved in the Six-Party Talks insist on 
maintaining their own views and refuse to make any compromises: 
first, the ability to negotiate systematically  may disappear. 
International society, except for the Six-Party Talks, has no other 
negotiation system that insures that they do not irritate North 
Korea or offend China.  Second, the U.S. and North Korea might 
conduct bilateral talks on their own, to the exclusion of all other 
parties.  Meaning that, the U.S. may accept North Korea's position 
as a nuclear country without explicitly announcing their acceptance. 
 North Korea's nuclear weapons only threaten countries neighboring 
North Korea.  Third, there could be a 3+1 meeting may be held (the 
U.S, Japan, South Korea plus North Korea), excluding China and 
Russia.  Fourth, the 'Five-Party Talks' may be held. Meaning that, 
there are two possibilities: either the U.S., South Korea, Japan and 
Russia hold their own Four-Party Talks first and then the U.S. 
represents them when it meets with North Korea alone; or the five 
parties hold talks together.  Either way, the process of 
denuclearizing the Korean peninsula excludes China.  The negative 
impact to China's diplomacy incrementally increases from the first 
outcome to the fourth.  However, in terms of China's national 
interest, the worst outcome is the first outcome. The first outcome 
indicates that the international society has no solutions to the 
North Korean nuclear issue. The best outcome is the fourth outcome. 
The fourth outcome indicates that the denuclearization process is 
steadily progressing." 
 
¶2. JAPANESE ELECTION 
 
"Reforms start from Japan's political arena (pg 2)" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(09/02): "The 
victory of Japan's Democratic Party [DPJ] is considered the result 
of the bad performance by the Liberal Progressive Party rather than 
a strong performance by the DPJ.  The DPJ's victory was bolstered by 
the economic crisis, which will certainly add pressure to the DPJ's 
future abilities.  The original political framework, where the needs 
of the newly-rising social classes couldn't be satisfied, is the 
reason that Japan's party has changed.  If it really intends to 
construct a two-party system, Japan must reform its bureaucracy. 
Generally speaking, with the DPJ's electoral victory, Japan has 
entered an irreversible new historical and political phase.  It is 
improbable that Japan will return to the Liberal Democratic Party's 
system where 'one-party rules'. The DPJ will not easily give up 
their opportunity to hold onto power and expand their electoral 
base.  In a sense, the political reform in Japan has provided a new 
paradigm for other Asian countries to deepen their democracies." 
 
¶3. U.S.-CHINA TRADE RELATIONS 
 
"U.S. broiler meat imports attacked; Chinese producers fear losing 
market share to cheaper rival (pg 13)" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (09/02): "The 
Chinese government is considering whether to launch trade remedy 
measures against imports of broiler meat from the United States, the 
largest broiler meat exporter to China, the China Animal Agriculture 
Association said.  The association, representing 20 large-scale 
broiler meat companies whose annual output accounts for more than 50 
percent of the total, is worried losing market share to the U.S. 
'We are aware of the appeal from the industry and we will carefully 
study it and respond accordingly,' said officials from the Ministry 
of Commerce.  The proposal, if enacted, will be the first trade 
remedy deal that China has launched in the agriculture industry and 
will seriously reduce U.S. broiler exports.  It comes at a critical 
time with China and the US embroiled in a row over possible tariffs 
imposed on some Chinese made tires.  Price is the key reason behind 
the shift, as consumers have become more sensitive to it during the 
financial crisis.  Chinese manufacturers have the capability to meet 
domestic demand without U.S. imports."
