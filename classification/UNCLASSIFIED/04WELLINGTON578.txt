INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION, JULY 19-22, SORRENTO, 
ITALY 
 
REF: STATE 145797 
 
 Â¶1. Post delivered reftel points July 8 to Chris Anderson, 
Environment Division, New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade.  New Zealand's International Whaling Commission 
(IWC) Commissioner Sir Geoffery Palmer had already departed 
for Italy.  Anderson offered to pass reftel points to Palmer, 
but noted that in June Palmer had participated in a 
conference call with Mr. Roland Schmitten, U.S. Commissioner 
to the IWC, and their British and Australian counterparts to 
discuss the issues referenced.  She noted that the GoNZ's 
positions closely matched those of the USG, and expressed 
appreciation for the USG's decision to co-sponsor the New 
Zealand/Australia proposal to create a South Pacific 
Sanctuary.  She echoed USG concerns over the IWC's current 
system of finance, noting the GoNZ's commitment to finding a 
new contributions formula.  Anderson reiterated the GoNZ's 
opposition, however, to the proposed Revised Management 
Scheme, but appreciated the USG's willingness to examine the 
issue further.
