¶1. We contacted MOD's Head of the International Operations 
Section of the International Relations and Operations 
Department Tomas Urbonas on December 21 to inquire about the 
status of the MOU on Life, Security and Mobility Support, per 
ref A instructions.  Urbonas confirmed that the GOL has 
reviewed the draft MOU and had provided comments to Embassy 
Kabul on December 18. 
 
¶2. Comment.  The GOL is proposing significant changes to the 
original MOU text which could necessitate significant 
bilateral discussion (Embassy is emailing the latest draft to 
S/SRAP and EUR/NB).  Embassy Vilnius would be happy to host a 
DVC to facilitate negotiations between the GOL and Embassy 
Kabul.  Embassy Vilnius point of contact is Political - 
Military Officer Michelle Hoyt.  End comment.
