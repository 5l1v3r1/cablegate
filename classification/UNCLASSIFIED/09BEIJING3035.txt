  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  SECRETARY CLINTON IN PAKISTAN 
 
"Secretary Clinton blames the Pakistani government for insufficient 
effort in the War on Terror" 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated to the 
official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (11/03)(pg 4): 
"Secretary Clinton's criticism of the Pakistani government reflects 
the U.S.'s concern over the slow progress in the War on Terror. 
However, Secretary Clinton's remarks had a negative impact in 
several ways.  First, they undermined enthusiasm in the Pakistani 
government for combating terrorism.  Since the War on Terror started 
in 2001, the Pakistani government has made a few achievements, but 
at the same time has undergone tremendous suffering.  Thus, the 
U.S.'s criticism undoubtedly added to Pakistan's suffering.  Second, 
they increased anti-American sentiment in Pakistan.  The Pakistani 
people have always been dissatisfied with the U.S. for ignoring 
Pakistan's interests in the War on Terror.  Secretary Clinton's 
remarks will only arouse more anger among the Pakistani people. 
Third, they presented the Pakistani government with a dilemma.  The 
Pakistani people disagree with their government's pro-U.S. stance. 
Secretary Clinton's remarks will only cause this view to be 
entrenched even further and thus increase the pressure on the 
Pakistani government." 
 
¶2.  MISSILE DEFENSE 
 
"Foreign media say China can duplicate U.S. missile defense system" 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated to the 
official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (11/03)(pg 7): 
"China's development of a missile defense system differs from the 
U.S.'s in several key ways.  First, China only plans to deploy the 
system in its own country.  Second, China's system will not lead to 
an arms race.  And finally, China's missile defense system is 
defensive in nature, only being constructed after the U.S. developed 
a missile defense system.  Despite the fact that the United States 
is developing a comprehensive missile defense system with components 
around the world in the air, at sea and in space, Western media 
still compliment the United States for 'protecting world peace.' 
And yet at the same time, the missile defense systems developed by 
China and Russia, which are limited in scope and based on the 
principle of self defense, have been described as 'destroying 
regional stability.'  It is so ridiculous to adopt a double standard 
on this issue." 
 
¶3.  CHINA'S MARKET ECONOMY STATUS 
 
"Do not care too much about the U.S.'s recognition" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(11/03)(pg 2): "Recognition of China's market 
economy status is a bargaining chip for the U.S.  The U.S. sent a 
clear signal during the first Strategic and Economic Dialogue in 
July that it would discuss recognition of China as a market economy 
by the end of the year, but during the latest Joint Commission on 
Commerce and Trade meeting the U.S. did not offer any specific 
timetable for discussing this issue.  This indicates that the U.S. 
has raised its price for recognizing China's market economy status. 
China should not care too much about this issue and should not 
sacrifice its national interests in order to pay such a high price. 
Such an attitude would not only be a good negotiation strategy, but 
would also reflect China's confidence.  China is the top trading 
partner of the United States, the EU and Japan, all of whom, 
ironically, have not recognized China's market economy status.   The 
U.S. has held several hearings on the issue, but has not offered it 
to China for political reasons.  The United States does not want to 
give up this bargaining chip easily.  In fact, the longer the United 
States postpones recognition, the less valuable it will become."
