CLAIMS - ZIMABAWE 
 
REF: A) STATE 55422 
 
     B) 06HARARE0972 
 
¶1.  The US Government is aware of eight (8) claims of US persons 
which may be outstanding against the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ). 
All eight claims arise out of the GOZ's Land Resettlement Program, 
which commenced in 2000.  The general pace of land seizure has 
slowed, as very few non-indigenous commercial farmers are left on 
their properties.  Nevertheless threats of seizure by individuals 
and government officials are unabated and disruptions to the 
operation of the remaining non-indigenous commercial farmers are 
frequent. 
 
¶2.  Under its continuing Land Resettlement Program, the GOZ has 
targeted almost all farm or wildlife property owned by 
non-indigenous landowners for compulsory acquisition.  The GOZ has 
consistently maintained that no compensation will be made for land 
itself, but that compensation will be made for improvements to the 
property.  However, to date, the GOZ has not compensated any 
American claimants for either acquired property or improvements to 
property.  Disruptions posed by land reform and the economy's 
generally chaotic conditions complicate meaningful valuation of the 
land or of any improvements made.  However, the values of the eight 
American citizen claimants properties at issue range from $100,000 
to more than $2,000,000. 
 
¶3.  In 2005, Parliament amended the constitution to grant title to 
the government of all agricultural land acquired in the past under 
the land reform program and any agricultural land that may be 
acquired in the future.  The amendment removed the right of 
landowners, whose land has been acquired, to challenge the 
acquisition in court.  There has been no progress either on the 
ground or in the courts to resolve compensation issues for the 
American-owned properties.  Because of judicial and political chaos 
during the land seizures, it is difficult to state precisely when 
most of the eight landowners were legally dispossessed.  Therefore, 
the dates of expropriation offered below are approximations only. 
 
¶4.  All eight properties have received either Preliminary or Final 
Notices of Acquisition from the GOZ.  Most of the American citizens 
affected have not asked the Embassy to intervene beyond raising the 
issue of compensation with appropriate GOZ officials in our normal 
course of meetings and through diplomatic notes. 
 
¶5.  a. Claimant A 
    b. 2002 
    c. Claimant A reported that his property had been invaded by 
approximately eight war veterans, and that a prosperous and 
connected Zimbabwean was grazing his cattle on the property. 
Approximately 60 sables had been released from a grazing pen and had 
subsequently disappeared - either escaped from the property or 
poached.  Post has not had contact with Claimant A in the past year. 
 
 
¶6.  a.  Claimant B 
    b.  2002 
    c.  Claimant B had an 85-hectare flower-exporting farm that was 
listed for compulsory acquisition by the GOZ under an initial notice 
of acquisition (Section 5 notice).   In 2004 the Mashonaland East 
Governor signed a "delisting" form, but the Local Government and 
Land Ministries refused to assent.  Claimant B then attempted to 
sell his property to the nephew of the Chief Justice of Zimbabwe's 
 
HARARE 00000543  002 OF 003 
 
 
Supreme Court, but the sale fell through as the nephew reneged on 
payment.  Claimant B is off the farm, and the Commander of the 
Zimbabwe Defence Forces, General Constantine Chiwenga, currently 
farms the land.  Post has not had contact with the claimant in the 
past year. 
 
¶7.  a.  Claimant C 
    b.  2003 
    c.  Claimant C received a final notice of acquisition (Section 8 
notice) in January 2003.  Claimant C purchased the 7,618-hectare 
property in 1985 with Zimbabwe Investment Center (ZIC) certificates 
to run a hunting and photographic safari business.  The property is 
part of a 17-farm, 80,000 hectare private wildlife conservancy that 
receives donor funding for the conservation of black rhinos. 
However poaching in recent years has reduced the black rhino 
population from 55 to 22 and jeopardized donor funding.  The 
conservancy owners are being harassed by some members of the local 
population, who are demanding a revenue share in the conservancy. 
Claimant C has stopped his safari business as he claimed invaders 
had poached all of the game.  Claimant C had been protesting the 
acquisition through Zimbabwe's courts.  After receiving permanent 
residency in South Africa, Claimant C was laying the groundwork to 
emigrate but, at last contact, was unable to secure the proper 
documentation to move personal belongings out of Zimbabwe.  Claimant 
has not responded to inquiries from Post. 
 
¶8.  a.  Claimant D 
    b.  2002 
    c.  Claimant D's rural wildlife-based property, which was 
transferred from a Zimbabwean spouse to a trust benefiting the 
couple's two US citizen children, is located in the district of 
Hwange.  Claimant D used the 420-hectare property primarily for 
hunting and photographic safari purposes.  The property was 
allocated to a Zimbabwean settler who has done nothing with the 
land.  Claimant D left the farm on October 1, 2002 and the settler 
kicked off all of Claimant D's employees by March 2004.  Claimant D 
has asked the Embassy not to pursue this case through official 
channels. In June 2007, the Claimant informed Post that there had 
been no developments in the claim in the past year.  The Claimant 
believes that the settler who received the farm has vacated the 
property and it is now uninhabited. 
 
¶9.  a.  Claimant E 
    b.  N/A 
        c.  Claimant G has received a Section 5 notice but is still 
in possession of the property in the district of Bikita in southern 
Zimbabwe.  This property is dedicated to a 26-farm wildlife 
conservancy containing both black and white rhinos.  The GOZ has 
announced plans to implement a land tenure scheme whereby title of 
conservancies reverts to the State, which then grants a 25-year 
lease to each property owner.  In return, the current owners would 
agree to indigenize their businesses through shareholder equity. 
The 25-year leases would be automatically renewable, but not 
transferable.  Ambassador Dell raised Claimant E's case with 
Environment and Tourism Minister Francis Nhema, who indicated that 
he would like to see Claimant E and the rest of the conservancy join 
the Trans-Frontier Conservation Area (a park linking tracts in 
Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and South Africa).  Claimant E informed us in 
June 2007 that he, along with other conservancy members, continues 
to negotiate a solution with the GOZ. 
 
¶10.  a.  Claimant F 
 
HARARE 00000543  003 OF 003 
 
 
     b.  2004 
     c.  Claimant F owns a 996-hectare farm in his American wife's 
name after Claimant F's son ran the farm into bankruptcy.  Claimant 
F does not have a Zimbabwe Investment Certificate.  Claimant F was 
able to move much of his irrigation and farm equipment off the 
property prior to losing control of the farm but lost 170 head of 
cattle.  Settlers first arrived on the farm in 2000 but Claimant F 
maintained good relations with them and local police, and he 
continued to have access to the farm until 2004.  From May to July 
2004, Claimant F received Section 5 and Section 8 notices of 
acquisition and asked the Embassy to write a diplomatic note 
protesting the intended acquisition.  The Embassy did so and 
received a pro forma response.  Shortly thereafter, Claimant F was 
no longer afforded access to the farm and was effectively 
dispossessed of the land.  There have been no further developments 
on the ground and Claimant F decided not to use the courts as the 
GOZ was not enforcing judgments adverse to its own interests.  In 
June 2007, Claimant F informed Post that there had been no change in 
the status of the claim in the past year. 
 
¶11.  a.  Claimant G 
     b.  N/A 
     c.  Registered in 1997, Claimant G is a subsidiary trust of a 
California-registered Non-Profit Religious Organization that planned 
to establish an environmental and life skills teaching center 
operating near Kadoma.  Claimant G purchased the 160-hectare parcel 
in 1999 but has been unable to obtain a proper transfer of title. 
Nonetheless, in addition to having exclusive use of the land since 
1999, Claimant G has the Agreement of Sale as proof of purchase.  In 
November 2004, Claimant G received a Section 5 initial notice of 
acquisition, to which it responded in court as well as by 
correspondence to various Zimbabwean government entities.  Claimant 
G also received a Section 8 notice of immediate acquisition, which 
it is was contesting in the courts.  Post has had no contact with 
Claimant G in the past year. 
 
¶12.  a.  Claimant H 
     b.  2006 
     c.  Claimant H informed the Embassy in April 2006 that he was 
the owner, along with his non-American citizen parents, of a 33 
hectare plot in Nyanga, Eastern Highlands.  Claimant H resides in 
Mozambique; his parents reside on the Nyanga site, where they grow 
apples on part of the plot and sell them in the local market. 
Although the plot is registered as a residential and not 
agricultural property, it was gazetted (Section 5 notice of 
acquisition) for takeover.  In April 2007, the Claimant informed 
Post that his parents had been forced off the land.  It is becoming 
increasingly clear, however, that the Amcit is a minority share 
holder and his parents, who are not Amcits, are the majority 
landowner.
