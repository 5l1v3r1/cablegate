Â¶1. We discussed reftel candidacy of Steve Carr for the ICRC 
Standing Committee with Harry Purwanto, Director for North 
American Affairs at the Indonesian Department of Foreign 
Affairs.  We appealed for Indonesia's support of Carr's 
candidacy and provided a nonpaper with relevant information. 
Purwanto said he was not aware that Indonesia had taken a 
position yet on any Standing Committee candidacies but would 
convey the U.S. request to appropriate offices and agencies 
in the Indonesian government for consideration.
