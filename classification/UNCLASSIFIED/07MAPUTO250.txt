SUBJECT: Mozambique: Demarche Delivered Regarding IAEA Report on 
Iranian Compliance with UNSCR 1737 
 
REF: State 23001 
 
On February 28 Charge d'Affaires delivered reftel demarche on the 
United States position regarding the IAEA Report on Iranian 
Compliance with UNSCR 1737 to Vice Minister of Foreign Relations 
Henrique Banze. Banze noted that while the GRM shared the U.S. 
concern over Iran's nuclear program, it was not customary for 
Mozambican officials to publicly denounce the actions of other 
governments. He said that his government would look for ways to 
communicate its concern with Iranian counterparts "behind the 
scenes."  (Note: Mozambique has not had diplomatic relations with 
Iran since Iran closed its Embassy here during the Iran-Iraq war. 
End Note).
