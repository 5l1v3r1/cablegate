INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN DARFUR 
 
 
Â¶1.      Pope Benedict XVI issued an appeal for national 
reconciliation in Sudan during an audience November 28 with 
Khartoum's Cardinal Archbishop, Gabriel Zubeir Wako. After 
greeting the cardinal's delegation, the Pontiff made the 
following statement:

The cessation of the civil war and the enactment of a new 
Constitution have brought hope to the long suffering people of 
Sudan.  While there have been setbacks along the path of 
reconciliation, not least the tragic death of John Garang, there 
now exists an unprecedented opportunity and indeed duty for the 
Church to contribute significantly to the process of forgiveness 
and national reconciliation.  Though a minority, Catholics have 
much to offer through inter-religious dialogue as well as the 
provision of greatly needed social services.  I encourage you 
therefore to take the necessary initiatives to realize Christ's 
healing presence in these ways. 
 
The horror of events unfolding in Darfur, to which my beloved 
predecessor Pope John Paul II referred on many occasions, points 
to the need for a stronger international resolve to ensure 
security and basic human rights.  Today, I add my voice to the 
cry of the suffering and assure you that the Holy See, together 
with the Apostolic Nuncio in Khartoum, will continue to do 
everything possible to end the cycle of violence and misery.
