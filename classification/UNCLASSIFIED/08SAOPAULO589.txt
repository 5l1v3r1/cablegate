Why Obama is the Favorite 
 
Lead editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (11/03) says: 
"In theory, the Republican candidate John McCain can still win the 
U.S. presidential election tomorrow. But, if this happens, it will 
be a surprise of proportions even bigger than the vertiginous 
eruption on the American and worldwide scene of Barack Hussein 
Obama.... McCain has revealed himself to be less important than the 
Democrats feared, while the growing excitement with Obama overcame 
the most pessimistic expectations of the Republicans.  And then Wall 
Street came down. ... Unless the ballot boxes contradict the polls - 
or because part of the electorate is hiding its racism from the 
pollsters or because not all Obamists voted - chances of a 
pro-McCain about-face are insignificant.  America prepares itself to 
make history."
