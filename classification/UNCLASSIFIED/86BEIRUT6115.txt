--  "WE WILL ADVISE THE GROUPS IN LEBANON LOYAL TO IRAN 
TO RELEASE THE AMERICAN ANDIFRENCH HOSTAGES IF LEBANESE 
PRISONERS IN ISRAEL ARE FREED AND WASHINGTON AND PARIS 
STOP THEIR USELESS HOSTILE ACTIONS AGAINST US.  IF THE 
DEMANDS OF THE OPPRESSED MUSLIMS IN LEBANON ARE MET AND 
IF YOU PROVE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE HOSTILE, OR BEHAVE 
ANTAGONISTICALLY, WE WILL INFORM OUR FRIENDS IN LEBANON 
ABOUT OUR OPINIONS, FROM A HUMANITARIAN VIEW.  THE FATE 
OF SOME OF THE HOSTAGES IS IN THE HANDS OF ISLAMIC GROUPS 
AND SOME OF THE ISLAMIC FORCES DO LISTEN TO US...IF IRAN 
SHOULD CALL FOR THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES, OUR FRIENDS 
IN LEBANON ARE FREE TO RESPOND OR NOT.  THEY LISTEN TO 
US SOMETIMES."
