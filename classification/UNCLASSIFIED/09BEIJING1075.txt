¶1. EASTERN TURKISH TERRORISTS 
 
"U.S. punishes Eastern Turkish terrorist leader" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(04/21): "Recently, the U.S. Department of 
Finance announced that they would put financial sanctions on the 
leader of the Eastern Turkish Islamic movement. This action is 
surprising because the U.S. hasn't sent 17 Chinese prisoners, 
located at Guantanamo, back to China. A Chinese expert has said that 
'the most unbearable thing for the Chinese' is that the West 
secretly or publicly supports Chinese separatist movements. Western 
scholars should realize that if the West does not end its support 
for terrorist organizations that threaten China, relationship 
improvements between the U.S. and China will only be empty promises. 
Based on a poll conducted by Global Times, from 2006 to 2008 most 
Chinese people believed that the Taiwan issue was the core issue 
between the U.S. and China. More recently, economic frictions have 
become the most important issue. However, the secret U.S. support of 
Tibet and Xin Jiang independence followers has seriously hurt the 
feelings of the Chinese people. Now, this is the most important 
concern between the two countries. If Western countries don't change 
their Cold War mentality against China, their relationship with 
China will hardly improve." 
 
¶2. CIA 
 
"Obama pacifies the CIA" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(04/21): "Chinese experts indicate that 
Obama's efforts to promote and publicize the [torture] memos are a 
good thing for the American people who wish to return to a more 
liberal government. This shows that the U.S. has admitted its 
mistakes. However, for conservatives, this is humiliating for the 
U.S. Earlier moves by Obama show his practicality on many issues. 
But he often makes his moves cautiously. By now, his reforms are 
still within the limits of what certain interests groups can 
endurance. There are still doubts as to his ability to finish his 
policy and system reforms. However Chinese experts indicate that, 
during Obama's first 100 days, reform is not Obama's main goal. He 
will not touch the bottom line." 
 
¶3. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"Slander by the U.S.: 'Chinese hackers steal secrets about top 
military fighters'" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(04/21): "'Chinese hackers steal secrets about 
top military fighters'; Chinese experts indicate that this 
accusation exaggerates the fact that the U.S. is actually looking 
for excuses to change its policy on network security. In fact, U.S. 
hackers are much more advanced than Chinese hackers. There is no 
concrete information that would allow experts to suggest that 
Chinese hackers have 'invaded' the U.S. As U.S. hackers are much 
more capable than Chinese hackers. What's more, absolutely 
confidential military information would be physically isolated from 
the internet. Why is it that ordinary hackers are able to attack the 
U.S.; the U.S. has the best Internet techniques in the world? 
Therefore, it is not convincing when they say that China intruded 
upon the U.S. network."
