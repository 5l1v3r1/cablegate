Charge conveyed Ref A demarche to the office of Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Miguel Angel Moratinos (who was in Brussels 
at the time) on June 17. Poloff had delivered Refs A and B 
demarches to Juan Manuel Gonzales de Linares, the Deputy 
Director General for UN Affairs at the MFA, on June 16, 
noting that there would be senior-level Embassy follow-up. 
Gonzales de Linares told Poloff that the GOS strongly agrees 
with the need for UN reform.  After reading Ref A talking 
points, he said that Spain supports U.S. reform priorities, 
although he could not fully comment on the budget issues 
contained in the demarche. Gonzales de Linares said that the 
GOS strongly supports the creation of a Human Rights Council, 
the creation of a Peacebuilding Commission, and the adoption 
of a Comprehensive Convention on Terrorism.  The GOS wants a 
"sober and reflective" discussion of UNSC reform, but does 
not support new permanent members on the UNSC.  He promised 
to circulate Ref A and Ref B talking points within the MFA. 
Polcouns and Poloff will follow up on these USG priorities 
with senior MFA officials in charge of UN issues in a meeting 
already scheduled for June 22.
