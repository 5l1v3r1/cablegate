Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
After a long and extremely rewarding career with the Foreign 
Service, I will retire from the U.S. government on December 
¶19.  It has been a pleasure to work with you to advance our 
bilateral relations. 
 
Thank you for your contribution to the advancement of 
military cooperation between the Tunisian Republic and the 
United States of America.  The twenty-third U.S.-Tunisia 
Joint Military Commission meetings in May of this year were 
successful due in large part to your leadership and to the 
respect we share for one another. 
 
It is my sincere hope that you, your family, and the people 
of Tunisia experience health, happiness, and prosperity, now 
and in the years ahead. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
David Welch
