SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: AMCIT PROPERTY CLAIMS MONTHLY UPDATE: MAY 2007 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: In May of the 2006-2007 waiver year, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) did not resolve any Embassy-registered property claims. No claims have been resolved so far in CY 07. Since January 1995, 2,509 Embassy-registered property claims belonging to 654 American citizens (Amcits) have been resolved. With the reactivation of two claims of one Amcit, there remain 684 registered property claims belonging to 298 Amcits. Including Amcit claims not registered with the Embassy, a total of 4,529 Amcits' claims have been resolved since January 1995. Most have involved compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds (bonos de pago de indemnizacion or BPIs). As of December 31, 2006, the GON had issued BPIs with a face value of US$319,700,000 to Embassy-registered claimants. As of May 31, 2007, the face value of BPIs issued remains the same. End Summary.

the month of May.
