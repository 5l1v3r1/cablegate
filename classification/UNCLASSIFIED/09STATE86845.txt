¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 

¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050157579 for the export of 
rifles and ammunition to Mexico. Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days. Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and

Guard, or Estado Mayor Presidencial (EMP), has never been 
party to a U.S. export license for firearms or ammunition. 
This check is to confirm receipt of these defense articles 
and verify security of the items. 

¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to verify that the 
rifles and ammunition listed below were received by the EMP 
and that the security measures for these defense articles are 
adequate. In its reply, Post is encouraged to comment on any 
information pertinent to this transaction such as end-use and 
concerns about the entities involved.
