¶1. Summary.  At the request of USTR, Department of Transportation 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Susan McDermott led a 
delegation to Rwanda to explore areas of assistance.  The GOR was 
keen on soliciting support for a COMESA air traffic management 
project, but the main focus of the visit was on identifying areas 
in which the USG could support aviation safety and security.  The 
immediate outcome of the meetings was for the Department of 
Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration (TSA) 
to return to Kigali in the next few weeks to conduct a security 
assessment, with subsequent recommendations, of the Kigali 
International Airport.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. Department of Transportation (DOT) Deputy Assistant Secretary 
Susan McDermott led a delegation of aviation safety and security 
experts from DOT, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and 
the Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA) to Rwanda from June 28 - July 1.  The 
delegation was in the region to meet with the Secretary-General of 
the East African Community Secretariat and the Directors General 
of Civil Aviation of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda to determine a 
plan of action for the announcement of the first regional safety 
oversight organization in Africa.  This was part of a program of 
continuing communication and coordination of assistance provided 
under the auspices of the Safe Skies for Africa Program.  Deputy 
United States Trade Representative Ambassador Karan Bhatia asked 
the DOT to conduct an exploratory mission in Rwanda to investigate 
potential assistance to enhance its transportation system to 
increase economic growth and enhance trade opportunities. 
 
¶3. GOR officials were eager to garner support for a project to 
control air traffic management for the entire COMESA region.  This 
is an initiative the GOR has developed with the help of two 
American consultancies, Williams Aviation and ARCON.  The GOR has 
been looking for ways to finance this project, yet the DOT 
delegation explained that the initiative was beyond their scope, 
especially as they would be interested in leveraging the work they 
have been doing for the past three years with the East African 
Community (EAC) rather than launching a new COMESA initiative. 
 
¶4. The DOT delegation briefed GOR officials on their work with the 
EAC and explored areas in which Rwanda could benefit.  The DOT has 
been working to harmonize regulations regionally to enable 
national aviation authorities to share technicians and inspectors, 
as they are in limited supply and expensive to train.  The 
upcoming admission of Rwanda into the EAC encourages both the GOR 
and the DOT that Rwanda will be included in these efforts. 
 
¶5. The meetings were very successful, as several areas of 
assistance were identified.  The FAA representative offered to 
review the Rwandan Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) ability to 
oversee airlines safety and current aviation regulations, and the 
TSA representative proposed a security assessment of the Kigali 
 
SIPDIS 
International Airport. 
 
¶6. COMMENT.  This visit was borne from the Trade Investment 
Framework Agreement (TIFA) signed between the GOR and the US Trade 
Representative.  Bringing a high level delegation from the US to 
investigate areas of potential USG assistance reinforced the USG's 
commitment to Rwandan economic development.  Follow-up is required 
to ensure that the security and safety assessments offered to the 
Rwandan CAA are conducted and further areas of assistance by the 
DOT are identified.  The meetings highlighted the fact that in a 
poor land-locked country such as Rwanda, addressing infrastructure 
concerns is a crucial trade facilitator.
