¶1.  (U)  Summary:  Police from the Phnom Penh anti-Trafficking Unit 
arrested five individuals, including two German nationals, for their 
alleged involvement in the sexual exploitation of four underage 
girls.  The German suspects are accused of debauchery; the others, 
one of whom is the mother of two of the victims, are 
Vietnamese-Cambodians accused of procuring underage girls for the 
foreigners.  Police believe the detainees are part of a pedophile 
network, and are investigating further.  The victims were referred 
to an NGO.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Phnom Penh police sting operations carried out from August 
19 to 21 resulted in the arrest of five persons suspected of 
involvement in sexual exploitation of children.  Keo Thea, Deputy 
Chief of the Phnom Penh anti-Trafficking Unit, reported that he 
arrested three Vietnamese-Cambodians on August 19 after they, along 
with four girls aged from 10 to 13, left the home of a German 
national, Karl Heinz Henning, suspected of sexually abusing 
children.  The three Viet-Cambodian suspects, one of whom is the 
mother of two victims, confessed to procuring the girls for the 
man's sexual exploitation.  Henning allegedly paid USD 30 for each 
encounter, and the procurers received 40 to 50 percent of that 
amount.  On August 20, police raided Henning's home and found 
pornographic pictures and videos.  The following day, police 
arrested another German national, Thoman Baron von Engelhardt, who 
was seen in the video footage with Henning.  With the exception of 
Henning, who was hospitalized in an escape attempt, the suspects 
were sent to court to face charges. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Mr. Keo Thea said that police started investigating Henning 
two months ago after receiving a tip from the anti-TIP NGO Action 
Pour Les Enfants (APLE).  He said that he believes that the German 
suspects belong to a greater pedophile network, as police found more 
than 1,600 pornographic pictures and video of Cambodian and foreign 
children, some of which were posted on an Internet website.  He 
added that police and technicians are trying to unlock additional 
computer files that were password-protected.  Other children and sex 
offenders were seen in the pictures and video footage; police are 
currently trying to determine their identities.  Thea said that an 
investigation is underway, and he believes that more pedophiles 
active in Cambodia will be arrested.
