¶1. On the margins of a Presidential Delegation visit to Madagascar 
to attend the inauguration of President Marc Ravalomanana (Reftel), 
Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns met with French Minister of 
 
SIPDIS 
Agriculture Dominique Bussereau at Ambassador McGee's residence for 
a wide-ranging discussion of agricultural issues.  In a candid and 
sometimes contentious discussion, they discussed the Doha 
negotiations including the upcoming U.S. farm bill, market access, 
domestic support, geographical indications, food aid, cotton, and 
genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  Each side was already 
well-versed in the other's position, and no new or significant 
ground was covered.
