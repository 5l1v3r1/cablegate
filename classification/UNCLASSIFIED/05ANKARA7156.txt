SUBJECT: PSI: TURKEY INVITES UNITED STATES PARTICIPATION IN 
EXERCISE 
 
REF: JEFFERSON - LYON EMAIL 09/08/2005 
 
¶1.  This is an action request-- see para 6. 
 
¶2.  Summary: The GOT seeks a formal commitment of U.S. 
participation in the first PSI exercise that Turkey will 
host.  In September 2005, we informed Turkey that we would 
participate in the exercise (ref a), however the level of 
participation would be adjusted as the exercise develops. 
Turkey now seeks additional commitment to their exercise to 
begin more formal planning of events.  Text of the Diplomatic 
Note is contained in paragraph 7. End Summary. 
 
¶3.  A sign of Turkey's increased commitment to the 
Proliferation Security Initiative was its volunteering last 
March to lead a PSI exercise in May 2006.  This will be the 
first PSI exercise conducted in Turkey and will have the 
broad participation of civilian and military authorities 
including the Prime Ministry, Turkish Armed forces and other 
ministries. This exercise, "Anatolian Deer", will also be the 
first PSI exercise with a land, sea and maritime dimension. 
 
¶4.  The general aim of exercise "Anatolian Deer" is to test 
and develop; 1) information exchanges on the national and 
international level; 2) political decision-making and 
consultation process; and 3) operational and legal framework 
within the PSI context. 
 
¶5.  The United States, in September, informed the GOT of its 
intention to participate in the exercise as an active 
players.  As of the end of November, France is the only other 
country that has made a commitment to participate.  In a note 
dated 18 November (text in para 7), the GOT requested that 
all players/observers for the exercise be identified by the 
end of December.  (Comment: The level of participation will 
assist the GOT exercise planners to properly construct 
details of the exercise to properly incorporate available 
assets into the exercise.) 
 
¶6.  Action Request:  We request guidance on how to respond to 
the Turk's request for greater detail on our participation in 
the May 2006 PSI exercise. 
 
¶7.  Begin text of Diplomatic Note Inviting U.S. participation: 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States 
of America and has the honour to inform the Embassy of the 
following: 
 
Turkey will be hosting the PSI exercise "Anatolian Deer" on 
24-26 May 2006.  Administrative details will be provided in 
due course. 
 
The exercise will consist of two stages.  The CPX 
(Command-Post-Exercise) part will take place on 24 and 25 May 
2006 in Ankara, while the LIVEX part of the exercise will 
take place in Antalya on 26 May 2006. 
 
Participating delegations may join the CPX part of the 
exercise either from their respective Embassies in Ankara or 
from their capitals.  All delegations are expected to arrive 
in Antalya on 25 May 2006. 
 
The exercise will be concurrently focusing on land, air, as 
well as on maritime interdiction scenarios. 
 
Participating delegations are kindly requested to state 
whether they wish to participate in one or both stages of the 
exercise and also the anticipate level of their contribution. 
 
The United States is invited to join the exercise which aims 
to enhance action readiness and cooperation among national 
institutions, as well as swift and effective cooperation 
between participating states in order to counter illicit 
trafficking and proliferation of biological, chemical and 
nuclear weapons, as well as missiles and materials that could 
be used to produce such weapons or delivery vehicles to 
terrorists and countries suspected of trying to acquire 
weapons of mass destruction (WMD). 
 
The Ministry thus kindly requests the Embassy to forward the 
invitation to its relevant authorities and inform the 
Ministry of the US authorities' intention to participate in 
the exercise before the end of December 2005. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey 
avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of 
the United States of America the assurance of its highest 
consideration. 
 
Ankara, 18 November 2005
