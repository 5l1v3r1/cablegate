SUBJECT: Travel Warning - Sudan 
 
¶1.  The Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the 
risks of travel to Sudan and recommends that American 
citizens defer all travel to Sudan due to uncertain 
security conditions and the possibility of violence and 
harassment targeting westerners. On April 9, the 
Department of State authorized non-emergency Embassy 
personnel and family members who had departed Sudan in 
March 2009 to return to the country. This Travel Warning 
for Sudan replaces the Travel Warning issued on March 9, 
2009, to note the lifting of the Embassy's authorized 
departure status. 
¶2. In March 2009, the government of Sudan expelled 
numerous aid groups from the country and senior 
government officials publicly called humanitarian aid 
workers "spies." Officials from the Sudan Humanitarian 
Affairs Commission seized the finances and assets of many 
of these organizations, as well as personal property of 
aid workers, including passports and laptop computers. 
¶3.  Recent protests have featured sharp anti-western 
rhetoric. There is a continuing possibility that ongoing 
protests may encourage violent action against Europeans 
and Americans. 
¶4.  U.S. citizens residing in Sudan despite the Travel 
Warning should have their own contingency plans to depart 
the country independent of the Embassy.  U.S. citizens 
should be prepared to leave Sudan in the event of an 
emergency, given the volatile political/security 
environment.  The U.S. Embassy is committed to assisting 
U.S. citizens to the extent possible, but the Embassy's 
ability to assist Americans is limited, and dependant on 
the permissiveness of the security environment in Sudan. 
¶5.  On January 1, 2008, two American Embassy employees 
were assassinated while traveling in their vehicle in 
Khartoum. In May 2008, the city of Omdurman, adjacent to 
Khartoum, was attacked by armed militias. The Embassy has 
implemented heightened security measures to protect 
Embassy personnel in Sudan, which include obtaining 
advance permission for all travel and modes of 
transportation to be used. A trial is ongoing. 
¶6.  The Department of State continues to warn U.S. 
citizens against all travel to Sudan, particularly in the 
Darfur area, where violence between Sudanese Government 
forces and various armed militias continues. Americans 
and Europeans have been victims of kidnappings, 
carjackings and armed robberies while traveling in Sudan. 
There have also been several incidents of hostage taking 
of European NGO workers and Chinese oil workers over the 
last year, as well as a hijacking of a domestic airline 
flight. Land travel at night should be avoided. 
¶7.  Travelers are reminded that the U.S. Government has 
received information on terrorist threats aimed at 
American and European interests in Sudan. Terrorist 
actions may include suicide operations, bombings, or 
kidnappings. U.S. citizens should be aware of the risk of 
indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets in public 
places, including tourist sites and locations where 
expatriates are known to congregate, and commercial 
operations associated with U.S. or European interests. 
Anti-American/European demonstrations periodically occur, 
mostly in the capital city of Khartoum. 
¶8.  Travel anywhere in Sudan, including Khartoum and the 
adjacent town of Omdurman, is potentially dangerous. 
Militia forces have instigated sporadic violence and have 
attacked locations in Southern Sudan. Threats have been 
made against foreigners working in the oil industry in 
Upper Nile state. 
¶9.  The Department of State urges American citizens to 
take responsibility for their own personal security while 
traveling overseas, to review emergency procedures and 
contingency plans, and to remain aware of their 
surroundings at all times. American citizens in Sudan 
should ensure they have enough water, food, and supplies

in stock in the event of an emergency. The dynamic 
political situation may require the U.S. Embassy in Sudan 
to close for safety and security reasons without much 
advance notice. The Embassy will nevertheless endeavor to 
notify American citizens of any such closures via warden 
message, posted at 
http://sudan.usembassy.gov/warden_messages.ht ml 
¶10.  U.S. citizens should note that the Embassy varies 
its operating hours without advance notice due to the 
dynamic political and security situation. Services for 
U.S. citizens are available by appointment only. Requests 
for an appointment can be made by e-mailing 
KhartoumConsular@state.gov. American citizens may request 
emergency services at any time, but the ability of the 
U.S. Embassy to assist U.S. citizens in an emergency is 
limited. 
¶11.  The U.S. Embassy is located at Sharia Ali Abdul 
Latif, Khartoum; tel. (249-183)774-700/1/2/3 (outside 
Sudan); tel (0183) 774-700/1/2/3 (inside Sudan).  U.S. 
citizens may contact the consular section by phone or 
email KhartoumConsular@state.gov. Additional information 
and U.S. Embassy warden messages are available on our 
website: http://sudan.usembassy.gov/. For after-hours 
emergencies, please call (249-183) 774-7000/1/2/3 and ask 
to be connected to the duty officer. 
¶12.  U.S. citizens should also consult the Department of 
State's Country Specific Information for Sudan and the 
Worldwide Caution, both located on the Department's 
Internet website at http://travel.state.gov. Safety and 
security is also available toll-free at 1-888-407-4747 
from within the United States and Canada, or at regular 
toll rates at 1-202-501-4444 for callers outside the 
United States and Canada, from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. 
Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal 
holidays). 
¶13.  Americans living or traveling in Sudan are 
encouraged to register with the U.S. Embassy through the 
State Department's travel registration website, 
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs/ui/ . 
 
¶14.  Minimize considered.
