In Today's Papers 
 
Corfu Meeting to Unlock Process with Yerevan (Sabah) 
Mainstream, pro-government Sabah reports FM Ahmet Davutoglu will 
meet with Armenian FM Edouard Nalbandian on the Greek Corfu Island 
during the OSCE meetings there June 27-28.  In mid-July, the 
Azerbaijani President Aliyev and Armenian Presidents Sargsian are 
expected to meet in Russia.  However, Sabah notes no progress is 
expected soon in the Yerevan-Ankara dialogue.  Davutoglu is expected 
to tell Nalbandian if no progress is seen in the Nagorno Karabakh 
question, the April 22nd action plan that was agreed on cannot be 
implemented.  Davutoglu will also meet the Russian FM Lavrov and 
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasian 
Affairs Matt Bryza in Corfu, reports Sabah. 
 
Baykal on The Action Plan for "Fighting Reactionary Movements" 
Media outlets report CHP leader Deniz Baykal commented on a copy of 
a document that allegedly indicates a military plot to overthrow the 
AKP government.  "If there are plots in the Turkish military without 
the knowledge of the TGS, that would be grave; if state authority is 
being used to conspire against the Turkish military, then that would 
be even more grave," said Baykal, reminding that the Colonel who 
allegedly signed the document was "still in office."  Baykal asked 
what was holding the government back from "coming to terms with the 
September 12 military coup." 
 
Court to Decide Today on Mor Gabriel Monastery (Hurriyet) 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports a court in will deliver its verdict 
today about a land dispute regarding the 1,600-year-old Mor Gabriel 
Monastery in the southeastern Anatolian town of Midyat, home to 
around 3,000 Syriacs.  Yilmaz Kerimo, a Swedish deputy of Syriac 
origin who attended the hearings as an observer, hopes the court 
will recognize the boundaries of Mor Gabriel monastery.  "The 
monastery is not a property for sale and branding Syriacs as 
invaders is a disgrace for Turkey," said Kerimo. 
 
Merrill Lynch: Turkey will Grow 4.5 Percent 2010-2019 (Yeni Safak) 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports Merrill Lynch said between 2010 
and 2019, Turkey's economy will grow with by an annual average of 
4.5 percent over the next decade, which means Turkey is a country 
that will grow more rapidly than others. 
 
Pentagon Sends 'Chip Weapons' to Iraq, Afghanistan (Hurriyet) 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports from Washington the Pentagon has sent 
'traceable chip weapons' to Iraq and Afghanistan.  The chips allow 
the U.S. military to track the weapons, and therefore to detect 
which groups get a hold of the weapons.  A portion of the weapons 
sent to Iraq are now in the hands of the PKK organization, claims 
Hurriyet. 
 
 "A Crisis Breaks Out with London" (Haberturk) 
Media emphasize the rising tensions between Europe and Iran over the 
treatment of protestors who opposed the official tally in the June 
12th presidential elections. Islamist-oriented Zaman reports 
"Western diplomats in Tehran were warned not to meddle in Iran's 
internal affairs," as, "Obama condemns Tehran," and "President Obama 
stepped up his criticism (of the Tehran administration) yesterday 
and expressed 'shock and outrage' at the crackdown against 
protestors in Iran."  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports, "The 
Tehran-Europe Line is Strained," and "The French and Dutch 
ambassadors to Tehran were called in to the foreign ministry and 
warned," while, "Iran decided to take revenge and declare two 
British diplomats persona non grata."  In addition, the paper notes 
"U.S. President Barack Obama answered claims the U.S. was behind the 
demonstrations by calling the claims 'fabricated and ridiculous.'" 
Liberal Radikal headlines, "The Iran-Britain Crisis Reminds of 
1979," as "Religious leader Ali Hosseini-Khamenei criticized Britain 
during last Friday's prayers," and "Foreign Minister Mottaki accused 
some Brits of being behind the opposition's activities."  Meanwhile, 
Radikal also notes "Obama denounced violence," used against the 
protestors but he noted "We are not meddling in Iran's domestic 
 
ANKARA 00000889  002 OF 003 
 
 
affairs."  Nevertheless, leftist Taraf reports from Tehran, "It is 
expected that Ahmadinejad will begin his term within the next 
month." 
 
Columnists See Serious Trouble Ahead for Iran's Regime 
Sami Kohen wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "Iran's election results 
are still debatable because of irregularities and the daily growth 
of the people's opposition movement.  It is hard to understand the 
silence in Ankara regarding developments in Iran.  In principle, 
this is Iran's internal affair but that does not necessarily stop 
Turkey from expressing its opinions and concerns about developments 
in a neighboring country."  Cengiz Candar wrote in 
liberal-intellectual Radikal: "Whenever any regime begins taking its 
own people's lives, it is a sign of the regime's demise.  Iran is 
not an exemption to this rule and by killing its own citizens, the 
Iranian regime can no longer properly function.  All of this also 
destroys the regime's argument about the legitimacy of its 
elections.  It may not happen soon, but the Iranian regime is headed 
toward demise."   Yasemin Congar wrote in leftist Taraf: "In the 
midst of ongoing protests, Musavi found himself in a greater 
position than he could have imagined.  At first, he was asking for a 
little more freedom and seeking to integrate Iran into the global 
community within the limits of the current regime.  However the 
intensity of protestors has made him a strong opposition figure. 
The current regime has completely lost support from moderate 
Iranians, and the country is moving to a new phase." 
 
Did the U.S., Turkey, and Kyrgyzstan make a secret deal regarding 
Manas Air Base? 
Leftist nationalist Cumhuriyet headlines, "Bishkek Changed Its 
Mind," as "the U.S. put down money and took back Manas."  Mainstream 
Sabah headlines, "The U.S., Turkey, and Kyrgyzstan Reached A Secret 
Agreement," and the paper notes, "Last month President Gul visited 
Kyrgyzstan and discussed the base," and "The U.S. will with give up 
to $1 billion in aid to Uzbekistan and Turkey will make investments 
in the country," in exchange for "limited use of the base to 
transport non-military supplies to NATO forces in Afghanistan." 
Columnist Ibrahim Karagul of Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak says Gul's 
visit to Bishkek "delivered Manas air base back to the U.S." and he 
calls Gul's gesture "The biggest award from Gul to Obama." 
 
Israel Continues Settlement Construction in West Bank 
Mainstream Sabah headlines, "Despite The U.S., Construction in The 
West Bank Continues," as Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak 
"approved a plan to construct 300 new homes in the West Bank," and 
"Both U.S. President Obama and the EU have stated they are against 
the construction of new settlements." 
 
In a related story, mainstream Hurriyet reports Izak Aharonovic, 
Israel's public security minister, paid a visit to the al-Aqsa 
Mosque in Jerusalem.  Aharonovic said his visit was a "routine" one 
whereas the al-Aqsa Foundation said the visit had been 
'provocative.'
