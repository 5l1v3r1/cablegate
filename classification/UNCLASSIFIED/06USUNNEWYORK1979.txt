REF: SECSTATE 171933 
 
¶1.  Per instructions (reftel) U.S. joined other SC members 
in supporting the draft resolution (reftel para 1), adopted 
(15-0-0) as Security Council resolution 1717 (2006).  The 
resolution was requested by the Tribunal in order to extend 
the term of office of the Ad Litem judges until the end of 
¶2008.  This was done to facilitate adherence to the 
Tribunal's completion strategy.  The General Assembly will 
now be asked to act on the matter.
