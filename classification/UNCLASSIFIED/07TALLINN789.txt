Â¶1. (SBU) On December 11, Poloff shared reftel points with 
Riho Kruuv, Bureau Director for Armament and Strategic 
Goods Control at the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
Kruuv gave assurances that the Government of Estonia (GOE) 
has in no way weakened their controls on export licenses to 
Iran in light of the National Intelligence Estimate and has 
no plans to do so in the future.  Kruuv stated that the 
Estonian Customs Board is vigilant about tracking down and 
checking all consignments to Iran.  In fact, the GOE has 
recently discouraged a few Estonian companies from 
exporting dual-use products such as aluminum powder and 
electronics equipment to Iran, suggesting that they find 
other 'not so sensitive markets.' (NOTE: Kruuv explained 
that since the companies in question only consulted with 
the Strategic Goods Commission about selling these products 
to Iran and did not actually apply for licenses, the GOE 
did not have grounds to officially notify other partners in 
the Nuclear Suppliers Group. END NOTE.)
