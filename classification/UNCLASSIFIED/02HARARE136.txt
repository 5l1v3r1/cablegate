¶1.   EDITORIALS IN JANUARY 11 EDITIONS OF THE INDEPENDENT 
    DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" AND THE INDEPENDENT WEEKLY 
    "ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENT," HAVE CRITICIZED A STATEMENT ISSUED 
    BY THE ZIMBABWE DEFENSE FORCES ON JANUARY 9 THAT THEY WOULD 
    NOT ACCEPT A PRESIDENT WITHOUT A CREDIBLE LIBERATION WAR 
    RECORD.  EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   UNDER HEADLINE "ARMY IS ATTEMPTING TO BLACKMAIL 
    VOTERS," THE "DAILY NEWS" COMMENTS: 
 
    ". . .MAKE NO MISTAKE, FOLLOWING WEDNESDAY'S BLOOD- 
    CURDLING DECLARATIONS BY THE ARMY GENERALS, DEMOCRACY 
    IN THIS COUNTRY IS NO LONGER IN THE INTENSIVE CARE 
    UNIT.  DEMOCRACY IS DEAD. . .WE SHALL POINTEDLY IGNORE 
    COMMANDER OF THE ZDF, GENERAL VITALIS ZVINAVASHE'S 
    DECLARATION ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS 
    BEING PREPARED TO 'ONLY STAND IN SUPPORT OF THOSE 
    POLITICAL LEADERS THAT WILL PURSUE ZIMBABWEAN VALUES, 
    TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS FOR WHICH THOUSANDS OF LIVES 
    WERE LOST IN PURSUIT OF ZIMBABWE'S HARD-WORN 
    INDEPENDENCE.'  WE DISMISS THAT WITH THE CONTEMPT IT 
    DESERVES. . . ." 
 
¶3.   UNDER HEADLINE "ZVINAVASHE CONDUCTS COUP AGAINST 
    DEMOCRACY," THE "ZIMBABWE INDEPENDENT" COMMENTS: 
 
    "IN A DISGRACEFUL BETRAYAL OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL 
    RESPONSIBILITIES GENERAL VITALIS ZVINAVASHE DECLARED ON 
    WEDNESDAY THE ARMED FORCES WILL ONLY SUPPORT LEADERS 
    WHO FOUGHT IN THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE.  IN OTHER WORDS 
    THEY WILL REFUSE TO SUPPORT THE VERDICT OF THE 
    ZIMBABWEAN PEOPLE IF IT GOES AGAINST PRESIDENT MUGABE 
    IN THE MARCH (9 AND 10) POLL.  BY STATING THAT THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  00136  141243Z 
    ARMED FORCES WILL NOT 'SUPPORT OR SALUTE ANYONE WITH A 
    DIFFERENT AGENDA THAT THREATENS THE VERY EXISTENCE OF 
    OUR SOVEREIGNTY, OR COUNTRY AND OUR PEOPLE,' ZVINAVASHE 
    HAS IN EFFECT CARRIED OUT A COUP AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC 
    PROCESS. . .ZVINAVASHE'S COMMENTS CLEARLY MARK ANOTHER 
    MILESTONE IN THE COUNTRY'S DESCENT INTO TYRANNY.  A 
    MILITARY COMMAND THAT OPENLY TELLS THE PEOPLE OF 
    ZIMBABWE THAT IT WILL NOT HONOR THEIR DEMOCRATICALLY- 
    EXPRESSED WISHES IS ONE THAT IMMEDIATELY FORFEITS THEIR 
    CONFIDENCE. . .THIS LATEST EXAMPLE OF THE PROSTITUTION 
    OF STATE POWER WILL BE A LITMUS TEST FOR SADC AND 
    ZIMBABWE'S FRIENDS ABROAD.  THEY MUST NOT CONTINUE TO 
    INDULGE A REGIME THAT HOLDS THE WILL OF ITS PEOPLE IN 
    SUCH CONTEMPT IN THE NAME OF A REVOLUTION IT LONG AGO 
    BETRAYED."
