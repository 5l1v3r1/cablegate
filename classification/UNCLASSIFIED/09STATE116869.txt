SUBJECT: TRAVEL ALERT: GERMANY 
 
¶1.  The Department of State alerts U.S. citizens that 
over the past few months, Al Qaeda has released videos 
threatening to conduct terrorist attacks against German 
interests.  While these threats initially mentioned the 
German federal elections in September, Al Qaeda continues 
to threaten Germany.  German authorities are taking these 
threats seriously and are actively investigating all 
threats.  This Travel Alert replaces the Travel Alert 
issued on September 24, notes continuing threats to 
German interests, and expires on February 10, 2010. 
 
¶2.  The Department of State urges U.S. citizens in 
Germany to maintain good security practices at all times, 
and to maintain a heightened situational awareness and a 
low profile.  Americans are advised to monitor local news 
reports and consider the level of security present when 
visiting public places or choosing hotels, restaurants, 
and entertainment and recreation venues. 
 
¶3.  The Department encourages U.S. citizens to read the 
current Worldwide Caution.  It provides additional 
information on potential threats to U.S. citizens 
overseas, along with advice on how to reduce your 
vulnerability to such threats.  Additional general 
information on residing and traveling abroad, including 
the latest Country Specific Information for Germany, may 
be found on the Bureau of Consular Affairs website. 
 
¶4.  Contact information for the U.S. Embassy in Berlin 
and U.S. Consulates in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Dusseldorf, 
Munich, and Leipzig may be found on the U.S. Diplomatic 
Mission to Germany's website.  All U.S. citizens 
traveling to or living in Germany are urged to register 
with the U.S. Embassy through the State Department's 
travel registration website. 
 
¶5.  Travelers may also obtain up-to-date information on 
security conditions by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free 
in the United States or outside the United States and 
Canada on a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444. 
 
¶6.  Minimize considered.
