SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSES 050117804, 050117818, 050117829 AND 050117848 
 
REF: 03 QUITO 1058 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on licenses 050117804, 050117818, 
050117829 and 050117848 for the export of automatic weapons 
and grenade launchers Ecuador. Post is requested to complete 
this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. Lack of response to a 
Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: To establish the bona fides of these 
transactions for significant quantities of automatic weapons 
and grenade launchers. Previous Blue Lantern (REFTEL) 
indicated that foreign intermediate consignee, MG Suber & 
Associates, used family members as end-users in order to 
circumvent import limits set by the Government of Ecuador. 
This check is to assure that the end-user, Armada del Ecuador 
(Tel: (5934) 2203353), has legitimately ordered the defense 
articles listed below. 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to establish the bona 
fides of these transactions by making appropriate inquires to 
authorities at Armada del Ecuador. Particular attention 
should be paid to the quantities on the export licenses 
versus the quantities expected by Armada del Ecuador. The 
following questions are provided for guidance: 
 
(To Armada del Ecuador) 
 
--Can you confirm the orders for the firearms listed on these 
license applications? 
 
--Why is the GOE purchasing this large quantity of firearms 
and grenade launchers? Is Armada del Ecuador undergoing a 
modernization program, increasing numbers for personnel, etc? 
 
--What will GOE do with the weapons that are being displaced? 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
