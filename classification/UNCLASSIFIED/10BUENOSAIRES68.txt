SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶1.  Local newspapers report on the Montreal First International 
Conference for Haitian Relief Efforts, highlighting that Canada and 
humanitarian NGOs called wealthy countries to cancel Haitian debt. 
Some papers picked up an Embassy press release on the U.S. Southern 
Command's 50,000 dollar donation of medical supplies for the 
Argentine Mobile Hospital.  On the negative side, one columnist 
accused President Obama of resuming U.S. interventionism in the 
Caribbean, using humanitarian aid as an excuse.  Another opinion 
piece echoed ALBA (Bolivarian Partnership for the Americas)'s 
claims that there is an excessive U.S. troop deployment.  Two local 
radio stations picked up very positive testimonies of Argentines in 
the process of adopting Haitian children, who thanked the U.S. 
Embassy for facilitating the issuance of emergency visas.  End 
summary. 
 
 
 
MONTREAL CONFERENCE:  SKEPTICISM ABOUT AID, 
 
FOCUS ON DEBT CANCELLATION 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶2.  Media reports on the Montreal First International Conference 
for Haitian Relief Efforts were somewhat skeptical, claiming that 
Haiti will need at least ten years to rebuild.  Pro-U.S., 
conservative La Prensa notes that Secretary Clinton, who attended 
the Montreal Conference, acknowledged the need to find better 
coordination mechanisms in Haiti.  La Prensa printed an AP story 
doubting Haiti's real chances of reconstruction, citing the 
country's lack of an efficient government, the fact that the 
earthquake aborted its economic recovery, and that corruption could 
deviate aid funds.  La Prensa also reports that the Davos World 
Economic Forum, which kicks off January 27, will also tackle how to 
help Haiti. 
 
 
 
¶3.  Both La Prensa and business-financial Ambito Financiero note 
that Canada and humanitarian NGOs called on wealthy countries to 
cancel Haitian debts.  Both papers highlight that Venezuelan Hugo 
Chavez took the first step by cancelling Haiti's 300-million-dollar 
debt for oil purchase. 
 
 
 
SOUTHCOM DONATION FOR 
 
ARGENTINE HOSPITAL PRAISED 
 
-------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶4.  Leading circulation Clarin, La Prensa and state-owned Telam 
wire service agency all picked up an Embassy press release 
highlighting Southcom's 50,000 dollar donation for the Argentine 
Air Force's Mobile Hospital.  (Note: Clarin ran a separate 
editorial praising Argentina's humanitarian aid for Haitians not 
only through the country's participation in Blue Helmets but also 
through its sanitary assistance and official and non-governmental 
support. End Note). Under the headline "Funds to Argentine 
hospital," Clarin reported that Southcom's donation would help the 
hospital provide care to thousands of victims.   Clarin also quoted 
Ambassador Martinez' remarks that "This modest donation in the 
expert hands of the military medical staff is only another small 
step in addressing the most urgent needs of the Haitian people." 
State-owned news agency Telam also quoted Ambassador Martinez: "We 
are proud to work with the Argentine government and the forces of 
the UN Stabilization Mission to help the Haitian people during this 
devastating crisis."

PRESIDENT OBAMA RESUMES U.S. 
 
INTERVENTIONISM IN THE CARIBBEAN 
 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶5.  Pro-government, business-financial Buenos Aires Economico (BAE) 
alleges that the U.S. troop deployment in Haiti is a return to an 
"historic U.S. interventionism in the Caribbean," accusing 
President Obama of using the humanitarian aid as an excuse. Under 
the headline "An arm-wrestling between Obama and Lula," BAE blames 
the U.S. for Haiti being a failed state. 
 
 
 
¶6.  The paper also accuses President Obama of ignoring Brazil's 
leadership of the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUTASH), 
noting that the U.S. delegated the reconstruction of the country to 
Southern Cone countries after the 1994 U.S. Pentagon-staged coup 
d'etat against Jean Bertrand Aristide. The paper claims that Brazil 
is not the only country that mistrusts the U.S., adding that French 
Cooperation Minister Alan Joyandet submitted a formal complaint to 
the U.S. stating, "We seek to help Haiti, not occupy it." 
 
 
 
ALBA PROTESTS EXCESSIVE 
 
U.S. TROOP DEPLOYMENT 
 
----------------------- 
 
 
 
¶7.  Pro-government, left-of-center Pagina 12 protests the excessive 
U.S. troop deployment, noting that ALBA (Bolivarian Partnership for 
the Americas) voiced its "concern over the excessive presence of 
foreign troops without any reason, purpose, venues or time of 
permanence," in veiled reference to the U.S. troops. On the other 
hand, the paper admits that Brazilian FM Celso Amorim denied that 
the 20,000 U.S. troops created any kind of conflicts with MINUTASH.

ADOPTIONS IN HAITI 
 
------------------ 
 
 
 
¶8.   Some radio stations picked up testimonies of Argentines in the 
process of adopting Haitian children. They stressed that the U.S. 
Embassy in Haiti managed to let them receive the children and also 
facilitated emergency visa procedures.
