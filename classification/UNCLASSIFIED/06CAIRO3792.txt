SUBJECT: EGYPT CONSIDERING USG NOMINATION OF RUTH 
WEDGWOOD'S RE-ELECTION TO UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITTEE 
 
REF: STATE 85758 
 
(U) Post shared reftel demarche June 7 with MFA Multilateral 
Affairs Office Director Mohamed Negm, requesting Egypt's firm 
support for the re-election of Professor Ruth Wedgwood to the 
United Nations Human Rights Committee.  Sharing Professor 
Wedgwood's C.V. and biographic date contained in reftel, post 
stressed the U.S. candidate's experience and familiarity with 
UN institutions as among the many reasons for Egypt to vote 
affirmatively in the September 7 elections.  Negm was 
non-committal, but promised to process the request and seek a 
GOE decision on the request.  We will follow up with Negm and 
Post will continue to raise Professor Wedgwood's candidacy 
with appropriate Egyptian interlocutors between now and 
September.
