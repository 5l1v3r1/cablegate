(U) On Friday, March 13, we met with Ministry of Foreign 
Relations (MINREX) Director of North American Affairs Renee 
Morales and America Division Staffer Jane Mary Rivera 
Guiterez to deliver points as instructed in REFTEL.  Morales 
thanked us for providing the information and promised to 
raise the issue with MINREX International Organizations 
Division.  She also noted that she had been unaware of the 
contentiousness of the Durban Review Conference proceedings. 
She added she was surprised that the issues of slavery 
reparations and the "defamation of religion" continued to be 
part of the Durban Review discussion in light of their 
divisiveness during the 2001 Conference.
