¶2.      RADIKAL / BOLGE / EVRENSEL / ZAMAN / HURRIYET:  President 
Abdullah Gul conducted the first official visit of his term to 
southeastern Turkey.  Following his travel to Van, Gul arrived 
in Hakkari province's Siirt where he was welcomed by an 
enthusiastic crowd.  Zaman daily reported the visit to the 
province was the first by a Turkish president in 25 years. In 
Siirt, Gul called on the Governor and provincial NGOs. Gul 
reportedly forget he was fasting for Ramazan and drank a glass 
of water.  Evrensel daily quotes Hakkari Bar Association 
Chairman Nevzat Anuk as telling Gul the issues in the region 
were all linked to the Kurdish issue.  Anuk told reporters 
President Gul did not made any single comment on what he said 
and remained silent and taking notes. Gul did not invite local 
DTP administrators, administrators of Human Rights Association, 
or KESK (Confederation of Public Employee Unions) leaders to the 
meeting held with local figures at the Governor's Office. Gul 
later flew to Sirnak in a military helicopter and landed in the 
23rd Jandarma Border Division Command to chat with soldiers on 
duty.  Gul's last stop in his trip in the region will be 
Diyarbakir today.   Representatives of nearly 30 civil society 
organizations in Diyarbakir, including GUNSIAD (South-eastern 
Businessmen Association) and KAMER (Women's Center), will come 
together to convey the common issues of concern in the province. 
 Diyarbakir Mayor Osman Baydemir, who said they would be pleased

able to give Gul a report generated by the Municipality.
