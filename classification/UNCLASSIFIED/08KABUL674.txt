SUBJECT: AF: AFGHANS REQUESTING POSTPONEMENT OF APRIL 24-25 REGIONAL 
ECONOMIC COOPERATION CONFERENCE (RECC) IN ISLAMABAD 
 
REF: (A) STATE 25526 (B) Maerkle-Holman email 3/15/08 
 
¶1. (U) On March 16, Mr. Enayatullah Nabiel, Director General for 
Economic Affairs at the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Econ 
Counselor and Econoff that he had just met with the Pakistani 
Ambassador to Afghanistan to request a postponement of the Regional 
Economic Cooperation Conference (RECC), currently scheduled for 
April 24-25, 2008.  The official reason given for the postponement 
request was the need of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (IRoA) 
to focus on the upcoming June Donor Conference in Paris.  He is 
proposing the last week of August or first week of September 2008 to 
allow for adequate Afghan Government preparation. 
 
¶2. (U) Mr. Nabiel confirmed the IRoA has decided to focus its 
efforts on preparations for the June Donor Conference in Paris. 
According to him, President Karzai is eager to see the RECC go 
forward as soon as possible after the Donor Conference. 
 
¶3. (U) Comment: This confirms our suspicions that the current list 
of international obligations/conferences facing the IRoA in spring 
2008 is stretching their resources.  Already on their plate are: the 
NATO Ministerial in Bucharest; IMF/WB meetings in Washington; a 
looming deadline for the completion of the Afghan National 
Development Strategy (ANDS); and an IMF mission expected in late 
April, early May plus, of course, the Paris donor conference in 
June.  Postponing the RECC in Islamabad until late August 2008 will 
help ensure the IRoA is fully focused on engaging its neighbors on 
regional issues.
