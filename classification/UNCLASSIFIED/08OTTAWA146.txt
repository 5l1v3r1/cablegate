REVIEW 
 
REF: STATE 3689 
 
(SBU) On January 29 econoff shared the 1377 report public 
comments concerning Canada with Kathy Fisher, Director of 
International Telecommunication Policy and Coordination, 
Industry Canada, Louis LePage, Manager of Telecommunications 
Technology and Special Projects, Industry Canada, and Jim 
MacKenzie, Senior Policy Advisor, International 
Telecommunications Policy and Coordination, Industry Canada. 
MacKenzie pointed out that in years past Canada has generally 
declined to comment for the 1377 process.  However, this year 
the Government of Canada wanted to raise two issues.  First, 
LePage pointed out that although the Minister of Industry 
issued an "order in council" calling on Canada to rely on 
market forces to a greater extent, he never created a formal 
policy proposal calling for the relaxation of rules in favor 
of guidance from market forces.  Second, LePage wanted to be 
certain that the authors of the 1377 report are aware of the 
Canadian Competition Policy Review Panel (CPRP).  The CPRP 
was launched on July 12, 2007 and charged with reviewing 
Canada's competition and foreign investment policies in six 
sectors, including telecom and broadcasting.  The Panel's 
report and recommendations are due on June 30, 2008.  LePage 
said that it is not yet known what the Panel will recommend, 
but it is likely that they will comment on foreign ownership 
restrictions in the telecom sector.  The submissions to this 
Panel can be read at
