¶1. In response to Post's deliverance of the NIACT reftel 
demarche on UN Security Council Resolution on Lebanon, 
Eduardo Rosales Ramirez, Director General of Foreign Policy, 
delivered to Post the GOH's official paper position on the 
situation between Israel and Lebanon. The position is stated 
in the annex to the letter dated August 8 from the Permanent 
Representative of Honduras to the United Nations addressed to 
the Secretary General. The official translation follows. 
 
¶2. BEGIN TEXT 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Honduras wishes to 
communicate the deep regret of the Government of Honduras at 
the critical situation in the Middle East, especially in 
Lebanon, where hundreds of civilians have suffered as a 
result. 
 
In that connection, the Government of Honduras concurs with 
the Statement by the President of the Security Council of 27 
July 2006, expressing shock at "the firing by the Israeli 
Defence Forces on a United Nations Observer post in southern 
Lebanon on 25 July 2006, which caused the death of four 
United Nations military observers." 
 
The Government of Honduras calls on countries involved in the 
military conflict to halt hostilities, for the necessary 
action to be taken to avoid continued civilian casualties, 
displacement of civilians and the destruction of their homes, 
and for efforts to be made to reach a solution which 
satisfies the parties and guarantees international peace and 
security.
