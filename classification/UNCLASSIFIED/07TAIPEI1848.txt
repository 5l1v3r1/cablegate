SUBJECT: Kaohsiung College Students Interested in Politics and 
Upcoming Taiwan Presidential Election 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: Student interviewees told AIT/K that southern 
Taiwan's youth are interested in politics and view the 2008 
presidential election as an opportunity to make their voices heard 
through the ballot box.  The students expressed concern about 
corruption and the shortage of high-paying job prospects and 
suggested greater cross-Strait opening would improve Taiwan's 
economy.  They stressed the need for increased government 
transparency, an unbiased media, and an independent judiciary to 
strengthen Taiwan's democracy.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) During a recent series of interviews with AIT/K, groups of 
students from Wenzao Ursuline College and Sun Yat-sen University 
expressed strong dissatisfaction with Taiwan's current DPP 
government.  Relatively well informed on domestic and international 
politics, the students generally agreed that much change is needed 
for Taiwan to become a mature democracy.  Young KMT and DPP 
supporters alike perceived the economy as being in decline and 
blamed the Chen administration for the dearth of well-paying jobs. 
The students suggested that increased cooperation with China and 
establishing direct transportation links would improve Taiwan's 
economy. 
 
¶3. (U) The students voiced concern about corruption and the intense 
rivalry between political parties.  They favored increased 
government transparency, an unbiased media, and an independent 
judiciary.  Most felt that the 2008 presidential election would 
present an opportunity for the younger generation to promote 
political reform.  A number of students told AIT/K that they plan to 
vote for candidates who are in favor of greater opening toward 
Mainland China. 
 
¶4. (U) The students named a variety of venues through which they are 
able to voice their concerns and play a role in politics.  Many 
students said they contribute to their university newspapers and 
some join political parties to push for specific issues.  Still 
others initiate political discussions in the classroom and hone 
their political awareness by joining international conferences or 
student leadership camps.  They told us that a growing number of 
students are interested in pursuing careers in government, some for 
job security, but others hoping to work in government to try to 
promote change.  Wenzao and Sun Yat-sen students unanimously agreed 
that voting is the easiest and most effective way for young people 
to be heard in Taiwan, and they expressed hope that their peers will 
turn out at the polls. 
 
¶5. (U) Comment: Taiwan's younger generation (ages 20-28), which 
makes up about 16% of the population, has the potential to 
significantly impact the 2008 presidential elections.  However, 
despite expressing a desire to vote, young voters often do not show 
up at the ballot box on Election Day.  End comment.
