In Today's Papers 
 
Prime Minister and Air Force Commander deny Turkish strikes in 
Northern Iraq 
All papers report that, after four Turkish soldiers were killed in 
clashes with the PKK, Turkish forces carried out air and ground 
operations in the Gabar Mountains.  Mainstream Vatan claims that 
American U-2 "spy planes" have begun to patrol the Turkey-Iraq 
border in order to monitor the activities of the PKK. On Wednesday, 
Turkish journalists in Batman and Cukurca claimed to have seen U-2 
planes.  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet and mainstream Milliyet 
report that Pesmerge forces are forming a buffer zone in Northern 
Iraq in order to prevent the PKK from crossing into Turkey and to 
cut their logistical support routes. 
 
Papers quote Foreign Minister Ali Babacan, during budget debates in 
parliament, stating that "as of today (Wednesday)," the US had 
started to supply Turkey with "real-time intelligence" concerning 
the activities of the PKK.  "We have started to strengthen the 
direct channels for communication and coordination regarding 
military, diplomatic and political measures against the PKK," 
Babacan said.  The Turkish Foreign Ministry (MFA,) however, released 
a statement saying that Babacan was not referring to specific 
developments that unfolded yesterday, but to the overall situation 
after the meeting between Prime Minister Erdogan and President Bush. 
 
 
Meanwhile, Turkish Air Forces Commander General Aydogan Babaoglu 
dismissed reports claiming air strikes took place against targets in 
northern Iraq.  Prime Minister Erdogan later said that "a cross 
border operation is out of the question for the time being, we have 
operations inside Turkey.  The Kurdistan regional government also 
denied the reports that Turkish forces  bombed Iraqi sites on 
Tuesday morning. 
 
MHP Wants Kurdish DTP Immunities Lifted 
All papers report far right party MHP drafted a parliamentary motion 
to restrict parliamentary immunities for crimes violating the 
integrity of state.  This appears to be an effort aimed at 
pro-Kurdish DTP lawmakers.  MHP is trying to garner the 110 
signatures needed to take the draft to the floor from the AKP and 
CHP. PM Erdogan indicated the AKP does not support the MHP effort, 
saying he will not try "undemocratic" ways to expel people who were 
sent to parliament through popular democratic vote.  Opposition CHP 
wants parliamentary immunities scrapped completely, according to 
papers. 
 
Turkey to construct airport on Iraq border 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak and tabloid Aksam carry Transport 
Minister Binali Yildirim's announcement that the construction of an 
airport in Yuksekova in Hakkari province, on the border with Iraq, 
will begin in 2008 and be completed by 2010.  Papers say the airport 
triggered speculation that, due to the frequent visits to the region 
by American delegations, the US was preparing to set up a military 
base there.  Aksam argues the base could be used in air strikes 
against Iran while Yeni Safak claims it could be used in the fight 
against the PKK. 
 
Editorial commentary on the PKK and Kurdish Policy 
Hasan Cemal observed in mainstream Milliyet (11/15):  "Kurdish 
politicians should distance themselves from PKK violence, influence 
the PKK to declare a serious cease-fire and engage in immense 
efforts to open the doors for democratic politics.  The DTP is an 
important party for me; its efforts in the parliament can help peace 
and stability in this country immensely.  Unfortunately, the DTP is 
making big mistakes.  They should realize that the doors for peace, 
democracy, and freedom cannot be opened by terrorist activities.  If 
the DTP plans to get the PKK accepted in Turkish politics, they are 
mistaken.  This will only increase tension in Turkey and strengthen 
those who don't support democracy.

Turkey is going through a difficult phase.  Possible operations 
against northern Iraq are getting closer.  It is understood that, in 
order to please the public, operations against the PKK will be 
launched before winter sets in.  In addition, the Iraqi Kurdish 
Leadership and the US are applying intense pressure on the PKK to 
begin a cease-fire.  There are also allegations that the US will 
force the PKK into a cease-fire and pull the PKK from Turkey in 
order to direct it to Iran through PJAK.  Following a cease-fire, a 
new process is planned by the Turkish government in the southeast. 
The doors will open for high level dialogue with northern Iraq. 
Then, the PKK will be brought down from the mountains.  With the 
application of economic, social, political and military measures, 
the PKK will be fully isolated.  We cannot know to what extent this 
scenario can be implemented.  However, we can only hope that such 
measures will eliminate terrorism, violence and hostile feelings in 
Turkey."
