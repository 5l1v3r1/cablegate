SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: POST SHIPMENT VERIFICATION: THE 
MACAU WATER SUPPLY COMPANY LIMITED 
 
REF: A) USDOC 05401 B) D322567 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the Bureau of 
Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control Officer 
(ECO) Philip Ankel conducted a post shipment 
verification (PSV) at The Macao Water Supply Company, 
Limited (Macao Water), 718 Avenida Do Conselheiro 
Borja, Macau on October 12, 2006. This PSV concerned 
gas detection sensors exported by Quest Technologies 
Inc., of Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, classified as 2B351 
and valued at $384.  These gas detection sensors are 
controlled for chemical and biological weapons reasons 
(CB) and were exported to Macau pursuant to DOC 
license D322567. 
 
¶3. Macao Water is the sole drinking water provider for 
the island of Macau.  It is a private company majority 
owned by French investors (more information at 
www.macaowater.com). 
 
¶4.  The ECO met with Chao Man Sou, the Manager of the 
Technical Support Department and Vice-Chairman of the 
Health and Safety Committee.  The meeting occurred in 
Mr. Sou's office at the treatment facility.  Mr. Sou 
confirmed that Macao Water had received the gas 
detector but that, unfortunately, as the unit was 
acquired over two years ago, it was no longer in use 
and had been discarded.  Given its low value, Mr. Sou 
explained that Macao water had not kept records of the 
disposal.  Mr. Sou explained that the sensor had been 
replaced by a newer sensor acquired from England.  The 
unit and its replacement are used to measure the 
chlorine level in treatment tanks prior to workers 
entering those tanks to perform cleaning or repair 
work. 
 
¶5. Mr. Sou was open and cooperative and provided the 
ECO with copies of the relevant documentation 
regarding the ordering and receipt of the item.  He 
also gave the ECO a tour of the water treatment 
facility. 
 
¶6. Mr. Sou stated that he did not believe that Macao 
Water had been informed of the applicable license 
conditions of license D322567 (i.e., no resale or 
reexport with BIS approval) as required by license 
condition three. 
 
¶7. The ECO believes Macao Water to be a very suitable 
recipient of U.S. origin controlled technology as it 
cooperated with the ECO, has a line of business that 
is consistent with the item's potential use, provided 
relevant documentation and allowed an on-site visit. 
Nonetheless, in accordance with guidance on reporting 
of PSVs where the items cannot be physically 
inspected, the ECO recommends that this PSV be 
classified as Limited.
