¶1.  (SBU)  PolOff delivered reftel points on September 15 to 
Enrique Yturriaga Saldanha, Subdirector General of the MFA's 
International Organizations group.  Yturriaga indicated that, 
although the GOS does not have a formal position on the 
UNAIDS Executive Director candidacy at this time, it is 
familiar with the candidate, Mr. Michel Sidibe, and has "the 
best opinion of him and his work in UNAIDS."  Yturriaga added 
that Sidibe represents "both the experience and talent 
required for the posting," and that the GOS supported his 
candidacy to the Global Fund.  The GOS will take the USG 
points under advisement, consult other colleagues, and 
carefully examine other candidates before a formal decision 
is made. 
 
¶2.  (U)  ESTOff also delivered reftel points on September 16 
to Carmen Castanon Jimenez, Subdirector General of 
International Relations, and Teresa Robledo de Dios, 
Secretary of the National AIDS Plan, in the Ministry of 
Health and Consumption.  The Ministry of Health and 
Consumption agrees with reftel points on the importance of 
selecting a strong candidate and continuing the fight against 
AIDS.  However, like the MFA, the Ministry did not offer a 
formal position of support for the candidacy of Dr. Sidibe, 
but agreed to review the USG points and consider them when 
determining which candidate to support.
