¶1. "Conflict Without An Arbiter" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (8/5) 
editorialized: "Bush supports Israeli policy so strongly that the US 
can no longer act as an arbiter of the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict.... Of course this is not a one-way relationship.  Israel 
also serves the US's interests in the Middle East.  By attacking 
Hizbullah in Lebanon, the Israelis are making a point to Iran, 
Washington's main enemy in the region today. The problem of the 
post-Sep. 11 guidelines in the State Department is that Manichaean 
positions and diplomacy do not match.... The current war is expected 
to result in a change in the regional status quo.  For peace to have 
a chance, Washington must find a way to resume the role of mediator 
without yielding in the essential points.  Reaching an agreement is 
already a difficult task.  Without the mediation of the only 
superpower, it will be impossible." 
 
¶2. "Already Died" 
 
Political columnist Clovis Rossi commented in liberal, largest 
national daily circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (8/6): "Fidel 
Castro had already died as a model to be followed much earlier than 
his biological decline, that is currently taking place. The 20th 
Century's last great political leader continues to be a myth, but 
the Cuban revolution is no longer an inspiration, except for a group 
of fanatics.  The proof can be seen by the two presidents who 
consider Fidel both an idol and inspiration. Venezuelan Hugo Chvez 
did not call his revolution 'Castroist,' 'Fidelist' or 'Cuban.' It 
is 'Bolivarian,' of Simon Bolivar.  Bolivian Evo Morales went back 
even further in time and his heroes are pre-Columbian.... Also 
contrary to Cuba, institutions have worked in Bolivia and Venezuela, 
where political parties and the media are free, and there are 
regular elections.... Experiencing decline, Fidel and 'Castroism' do 
not have any future, only past." 
 
¶3. "Fidel And The Brazilian Left Wing" 
 
University Professor Carlos Mauricio Ardissone maintained in 
center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (8/5): "It is worrisome to confirm 
the Brazilian left wing's (politicians, academia and artists) 
resistance in admitting the obvious:  Fidel Castro is a dictator 
like many others. How to call a leader who has been in power for 
almost 50 years and needs to maintain imprisoned politicians whose 
only crime is that of diverging from the thought of the sole command 
of the Cuban Communist Party? How to refer in regards to a leader 
who smashed the opposition for years, does not allow freedom of the 
press and a multiparty system, and uses education as means of 
indoctrination?  The goodwill of our supposed leftist politicians, 
academics and artists vis-`-vis Fidel Castro is intolerable and 
contradictory.... The Brazilian left wing cannot paralyze or 
impoverish the discussion on Cuba.  The complexity of international 
relations allows for us to be equally tough and critical towards the 
US foreign policy for Cuba as well as in regards to Castro's 
regime."
