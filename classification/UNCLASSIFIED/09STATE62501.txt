SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050123348 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050123348 for the export of 
aircraft components to South Africa.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days. Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: The end-user on this license is listed 
as "Safair PTY LTD Kit Marshall Store for ECA's."  While 
PM/DDTC is familiar with Safair, it is unclear if Kit 
Marshall Store is a separate entity.  This check is to verify 
that the items were received by the end-user and clarify the 
identity of "Kit Marshall Store." 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Post is requested to verify that Safair 
received the fuel system safety retrofit kits listed below by 
making appropriate inquiries to Safair PTY LTD and any other 
identified end-user.  Post is also requested to inquire about 
the inclusion of "Kit Marshall Store" on this license and 
determine if it is a separate company.  If so, Post is 
requested to determine its role in the transaction and 
establish the bona fides of Kit Marshall Store by making 
inquiries to representatives of the company and appropriate 
South African authorities. 
 
In its reply, Post is encouraged to comment on any 
information pertinent to this transaction such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
