¶1. (U) Press reporting of the HAMAS meetings with Egyptian 
officials in Cairo suggested that HAMAS may nominate Jamal 
al-Khudari as Prime Minister designate.  Jamal al-Khudari is 
a prominent businessman and independently elected PLC member 
from the Gaza City district.  While al-Khudari ran as an 
independent and did not run on the HAMAS list, he appeared 
frequently at HAMAS campaign rallies and was publicly 
endorsed by the HAMAS leadership.  His public affiliation 
with the movement goes back to the early 1990s.  Al-Khudari 
holds a degree in electrical engineering from an Egyptian 
university.  He has served as chairman of the board of 
trustees of the Islamic University in Gaza since 1990 and is 
a former member of the PALTRADE Board of directors.  He comes 
from a prominent and respected family in Gaza.  ConGen 
contacts that have met al-Khudari describe him as outgoing, 
ambitious, highly organized and perceptive. 
 
¶2. (U) Al-Khudari denied reports that HAMAS offered him the 
Prime Minister position in statements to the press on 
February 8, but said that if offered he would accept the 
position or any other ministerial post.  Al-Khudari told the 
Egyptian newspaper al-Hayah that if appointed as Prime 
minister, he would seek to form a pragmatic, technocratic and 
politically inclusive government with ministers from outside 
the PLC.
