¶1.   Paris greatly appreciates efforts that GITM-U, MSO and 
ENM network engineers have put into designing the upgrade to 
OpenNet Plus in Paris and Marseille. 
 
¶2.  However, while there may not be indications of excessive 
or frequent circuit outages between Marseille and Paris (per 
ref A), the fact remains that without a local domain 
controller in Marseille users there will not be able to 
logon and perform any type of work during an outage or 
network latency problem.  Marseille performs all consular 
operations for southern France and Monaco.  Even minimal 
outage periods have a serious impact on the consulate's 
ability to check passports, issue visas or do name checks, 
etc.  The number of system users should not be a 
consideration.  Consulate General Marseille has a vital role 
to play in diplomatic and consular operations in France and 
a significant public clientele benefits from its operations. 
 
¶3.  Since cost should not be a factor, Paris strongly 
believes that it would be prudent to install a domain 
controller in Marseille to allow some operations to continue 
during any outage that might occur.  If necessary, equipment 
can be made available from existing Paris stock.  Potential 
cost savings could be realized by doing this now rather than 
later when another installation team would have to be 
scheduled to travel to post. 
 
¶4.  Post requests that the Department (MSO and ENM) 
reconsider the network design for Marseille to include a 
domain controller now.
