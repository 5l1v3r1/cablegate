SUBJECT: EXPULSION OF YEMENI DIPLOMAT 
 
¶1.  MFA Protcol Director, Mohamed Taha Mustafa, called in DCM 
on March 28,2004 to discuss the pending expulsion from the 
U.S. of Yemeni diplomat Abdulla M. Al-Socotry.  Ambassador 
Taha Mustafa reviewed the facts of the case explaining that 
the ROYG considers the expulsion decision "harsh," but would 
nonetheless accept it and comply. 
 
¶2.  Nevertheless, Taha Mustafa asked that the State 
Department not impose additional and undue hardship on 
Socotry's wife and family by enforcing the expulsion within 
the stipulated 30-day period.  He asked that the State 
Department give all possible consideration to allowing 
Socotry, his wife and children to remain until the end of the 
school year -- approximately June 30.  Taha Mustafa offered 
assurance that Socotry and his family would depart as soom as 
the children finish out the school year. 
 
¶3.  The Protocol Director added that he had conferred earlier 
in the day with the MFA assignments office and that Socotry's 
reassignment had already been approved.  The effective date 
of his reassingment has been set at July 1, in the hope that 
the State Department will accede to Yemen's request to allow 
Socotry, his wife and children to remain until the end of the 
school year. 
 
¶4.  Post requests guidance on the case of Mr. Socotry and his 
family.
