¶1. Polchief shared reftel points June 8 with MFA 
Director of International Organizations Yacub Al- 
Hosani urging the UAE to issue a public statement in 
support of the UNSCR on Iraq.  The UAE's official news 
agency published the following statement from an 
unnamed foreign ministry official on June 10: "The UAE 
welcomes the UNSCR on Iraq and appeals to all sectors 
of the Iraqi people to seize this historic opportunity 
to close the past page of differences, divisions and 
violence and join their hands in one coherent front to 
get Iraq out of its current situation to restore 
security and stability."  The MFA source said the 
consensus on the Iraq resolution "provides an umbrella 
for the return of full sovereignty to Iraq." 
 
¶2. UAE Justice Minister Mohamed AL-Dhaheri reiterated 
his government's support for the UNSCR on Iraq during 
the OIC summit in Istanbul on June 15, adding that the 
UAE was in full support of Iraq's full sovereignty 
over Iraq's natural resources.
