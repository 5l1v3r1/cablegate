SUBJECT: PREPARING FOR THE NUCLEAR SECURITY SUMMIT: 
PREPARATIONS FOR THE FEBRUARY 9-11 SHERPA MEETING IN THE 
HAGUE 
 
REF: STATE 7493 
 
Embassy of the Netherlands Political Officer Hanneke Boerma 
and Deputy Political Counselor requested an appointment with 
South Africa's Nuclear Security Summit Sherpa, Ambassador 
Abdul Minty, as requested reftel.  As Ambassador Minty is out 
of the country, Department of International Relations and 
Cooperation Deputy Director for Nuclear Disarmament and 
Nonproliferation Johann Kellerman met with us on January 28. 
POLOFF presented a note verbale containing the text provided 
reftel.  Boerma delivered a formal invitation from the 
Government of the Netherlands, along with logistics 
information on the Sherpa meetings.  Kellerman said 
Ambassador Minty was traveling in Europe and assured us he 
would convey our message.  He also noted that South Africa 
does not have a sous-sherpa for the Summit.  He expressed 
confidence that South Africa's embassy in the Hague would 
support Ambassador Minty's participation in the Sherpa 
meeting.
