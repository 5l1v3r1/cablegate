In a clarification, the Presidency of the Region of Kurdistan 
denied that it is interfering in the internal affairs of 
Turkey with the approaching elections there. 
 
The Statement by the Presidency of the Region stated the 
following: 
 
With the approaching Turkish elections to be held next July, 
there are rumors that we are interfering in the internal 
affairs of Turkey and that we have certain influences over 
the Turkish elections. 
 
We emphasize that we did not interfere in the internal 
affairs of Turkey and we will not have a negative influence 
on the future of the elections.  On the contrary despite the 
attempts of the Turkish authorities to obstruct development 
and progress in the region of Kurdistan, we have always tried 
to keep ourselves far from the internal problems of Turkey. 
 
Although we have repeatedly been accused of helping and 
assisting the PKK, we reiterate again that we have not 
supported and assisted this party with logistics or in any 
other way, but instead we have tried to build friendly 
relations with all of the political and social components in 
Turkey.  This is because we do not encourage any interference 
in the affairs of any country and we do not condone the use 
of violence to solve problems, but instead have always chosen 
dialogue and mutual understanding in solving them. 
 
If we are called upon to cooperate and support any political 
process that serves peace and peaceful coexistence and 
strengthen good-neighborly relations between the region of 
Kurdistan and Turkey, we would be ready.  We are fully 
convinced that friendship, good-neighborliness and 
cooperation are the only way through which we will be able to 
coexist with Turkey - or any other neighboring country - on 
the basis of common interests and respect for others, and to 
answer all accusations. 
 
The Spokesman for the Presidency of the Region of Kurdistan
