REF:  A) WELLINGTON 916  B) STATE 211064 
 
Embassy forwarded documents received November 24, 2005 and 
requested clearance for the R/V Roger Revelle for the period 
01/20/2005 to 03/03/2005 from the Cook Islands High 
Commission.  Embassy originally sent application for 
research to the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade (ref A) but we were advised by MFAT to contact the 
authorities of the Cook Islands directly in order to obtain 
clearance.  We will advise when the High Commission replies 
to the clearance request.
