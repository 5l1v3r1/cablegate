OF U.S. STRIKE ON SYRIAN TERRITORY 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The three papers lead with photographs and statements by Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas in Cairo on October 27.  Abbas announced 
to the press that PLO factions have approved the Egyptian draft 
proposal for Palestinian political unity.  The paper also reports 
that Hamas has given verbal support for the Egyptian plan in advance 
of reconciliation talks to begin in Cairo next month.  Abbas 
commented that, "There are about 57 Arab and Islamic countries ready 
for normalization [with Israel] but they condition normalization on 
Israeli withdraw from occupied lands," the papers note. 
 
Al Quds reports on its first page about the burial of "victims" of 
the recent U.S. strike on Syria and quote Syrian officials calling 
the strike a, "dangerous aggression."  In its editorial, Al Quds 
condemns the "aggression" and reports separately that Iraqi 
officials are concerned over its implications on Iraqi-Syrian 
relations.  Reporting adds that Syrian crowds shouted anti-Bush and 
anti-U.S. slogans.  Egypt and the EU have expressed concern over the 
strike while statements from Paris called for "self restraint," the 
paper concluded. 
 
"The two-state solution is reeling under the blows of Israeli 
settlement activities," according to Palestinian Authority Prime 
Minister Fayyad who is quoted on all front pages.  Fayyad added that 
Palestinians, "won't accept any state at any cost."  Fayyad's 
statements were made at a local economic conference where experts 
agreed that the Palestinian economy will not be significantly 
affected by the international financial crisis. 
 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam prominently report on inside, "local news" 
pages about the October 27 "solidarity" visit of Consul General Jake 
Walles to the Ramallah area West Bank village of Turmusayya, "where 
many U.S. citizens live."  Showing pictures of Walles picking 
olives, the papers run quotes from Walles stating that, "the attacks 
against innocent [Palestinian] farmers during the olive season are 
unacceptable.  We hope that these attacks stop.  We have discussed 
the issue of halting these attacks with the Israeli authorities." 
Walles also commented on US-Palestinian relations, stating they were 
"excellent" and reaffirmed U.S. commitment to the peace process.  Al 
Quds' story added that Walles attended the first international 
soccer game to be held in the Palestinian Territories for many years 
on October 26. 
 
On inside pages, the dailies report that Palestinian Authority 
security forces, which deployed to the southern West Bank city of 
Hebron last week, made their first arrests on October 27.  In other 
security news, Al Ayyam runs a front page report about a Palestinian 
schoolgirl in Gaza who suffered moderate injuries during Israeli 
shelling of her school. 
 
The front pages of Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida cite news 
agencies in reporting that Israeli election campaigns have already 
begun and polls show Kadima party leader Livni leading ahead of 
Likud party leader Netanyahu.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
1)  Al Quds' first editorial opines under the title, "Interest and 
reconciliation during the lost time" (10/28): "This lost time 
[during U.S. and Israeli elections] should be used to put the 
 
JERUSALEM 00001956  002 OF 002 
 
 
Palestinian house in order since we do not know who is going to rule 
Israel or the U.S. after their elections, and the wind, as is 
usually the case, might not blow in the [Palestinians'] favored 
direction... 
2)  Al Quds' second editorial opines under the title, "U.S. 
aggression on Syria"(10/28):  "We cannot find any justification or 
explanation for the breech of the borders of a sovereign state by 
anyone, therefore these [U.S] aggressions are met with nothing but 
denunciation and condemnation and demands that Washington officially 
apologize and provide suitable compensation to the families of the 
victims.  The Iraqi Government, that is currently reviewing a U.S 
security agreement, should also apologize if it had knowledge of the 
aggression or apologize and feel ashamed if it did not have 
knowledge of the aggression." 
3) Rajab Abu Sarraya editorializes in Al Ayyam under the title 
"America and Israel:  Changes on the horizon" (10/28): "The U.S. 
elections might be very close as they were in 2000 when some 500 
votes proved decisive... the changes resulting from the election may 
well go beyond the look or color of the democratic candidate, 
although Western culture has long exhibited arrogance in dealing 
with the "colored" world... Obama's victory could eventually reform 
the U.S. from the inside in a way that will qualify it to lead the 
world in a different way from the previous republican 
administration.  Israel will be most affected by changes in 
America... When will the Palestinians notice that they do not live 
in this world alone and that they need to achieve their interests in 
the most effective way?  When will they capitalize on the internal 
dynamism that will make internal changes possible..?"
