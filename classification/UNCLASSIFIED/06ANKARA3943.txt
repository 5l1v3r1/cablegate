BEGIN TEXT 
 
July 5, 2006 
 
We view the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's long and 
medium-range missile tests - conducted on July 5, 2006 
despite warnings of the international community - with 
serious concern. 
 
After the DPRK announced that it had nuclear weapons on April 
24, 2003, it is obvious that these tests - which were carried 
out without considering the security of its neighbors - would 
not contribute to genuine efforts being carried out to 
maintain regional peace and stability. 
 
There is no doubt that the long-range missile test of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea causes negative 
consequences for international peace and security. 
 
We support the endeavors of the international community, 
initially the United Nations Security Council, for adopting a 
united and determined approach on the matter. 
 
We call on the government of the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea to bring its missile program to an end as soon as 
possible in order to conform to the moratorium the DPRK 
announced on long-range missile tests in the past, to comply 
with the principles of the Missile Technology Control Regime, 
and to comply with the Hague Code of Conduct Against 
Ballistic Missile Proliferation. 
 
We expect the government of the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea to resume the Six-Party Talks immediately, to 
fulfill its commitments stemming from the Joint Statement of 
September 19, 2005, and to re-open its nuclear program to the 
international inspection system.
