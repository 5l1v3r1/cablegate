¶1. (SBU) Summary: On January 31, the BRV published a decree 
reforming the "Law Against Speculation and Hoarding," a 2007 
decree that criminalized the hoarding and speculation of 
regulated goods, reduced the legal barriers for 
expropriations, and established harsh fines and jail time for 
violators (Reftel A).  The reformed "Anti-Speculation and 
Hoarding Law" closely tracks a previous decree, but increases 
the penalties for violators, adds undefined first-need goods 
to those items covered by the law, criminalizes purchasing 
controlled price goods for lucrative ends, and requires that 
all producers, distributors, and importers submit any 
operational information or documentation requested by the 
BRV.  The re-issuance of this decree intensifies pressure on 
a private sector stifled by price controls, clearly reminding 
them of the BRV's punitive power.  End Summary.

¶2. (SBU) As detailed in ref A, Chavez' February 21, 2007 "Law 
Against Speculation and Hoarding" criminalized the hoarding, 
speculation, fraudulent altering of prices, boycott, and 
exporting of controlled products produced for the domestic 
market.  These crimes were punishable by prison terms ranging 
from 2-6 years and fines from 130-20,000 tax units 
(approximately USD 2,800 to USD 428,000.)  It also defined 
all stages of the production cycle for regulated foods as 
within the ambit of "public utility and the social interest,"
