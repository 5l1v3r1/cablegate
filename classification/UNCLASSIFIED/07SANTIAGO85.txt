SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - IRAQ 
 
On January 17, business and financial "Diario Financiero" (circ. 
30,000) carried an editorial entitled "The United States in Iraq." 
Quote: 
 
"In spite of the confidence shown by President George Bush, the fact 
is that Iraq has become a true headache for the most powerful 
country on the planet....  Whether Bush's new plan in Iraq will 
render the expected fruit, no one knows.  However, it is likely that 
this issue will continue depleting his political support.... 
Whatever the case, the United States should reevaluate the role 
performed in Iraq because George Bush's risk is that the country 
will become a new Vietnam... The lesson learned for the United 
States is that it has to focus on strengthening international 
institutionalism, via the U.N., which in fact has also been damaged 
by this episode."
