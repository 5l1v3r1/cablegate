The Embassy of the United States of America presents its 
compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian

the information contained in the subject Diplomatic Note to 
the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA has 
also spoken directly with the State ATM Corporation on this 
issue.  Although the FAA is not involved in commercial debt 
collection, they have contacted the American users referenced

the accumulated debt and asking them to contact the State ATM 
Corporation as soon as possible.  They have additionally 
notified the users of the MFA statement that, until the issue 
is resolved, additional requests for use of Russian 
Federation airspace may not be accepted for consideration. 
 
Complimentary closing.
