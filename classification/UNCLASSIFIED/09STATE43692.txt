 ¶1. (U) This is an action request.  The Department instructs 
USUN to join consensus on the following PRST on Cyprus 
scheduled to be approved by the Security Council on April 30, 
¶2009. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin text: 
 
The Security Council commends the Greek Cypriot and Turkish 
Cypriot leaders for the political leadership they have shown 
and warmly welcomes the progress made so far in the 
fully-fledged negotiations, and the leaders, joint 
statements. 
 
The Security Council strongly urges the leaders to increase 
the momentum in the negotiations to ensure the full 
exploitation of this opportunity to reach a comprehensive 
settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with 
political equality as set out in the relevant Security 
Council resolutions. 
 
The Security Council emphasises the importance of all parties 
engaging fully, flexibly and constructively and looks forward 
to decisive progress in the negotiations in the near future. 
 
The Security Council recognises that a solution requires the 
support of both sides and will require the approval of both 
communities in separate and simultaneous referenda. In this 
context, the Security Council fully supports the 
Secretary-General's Good Offices Mission and encourages the 
SG's Special Adviser to continue to offer the leaders any 
support they need to achieve a settlement. 
 
The Security Council reiterates its full support for the 
process and underlines the benefits that reunification will 
bring to the Island.
