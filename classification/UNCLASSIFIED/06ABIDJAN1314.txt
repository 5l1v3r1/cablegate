SUBJECT: STATE PRIMARY SCHOOLS SHUT DUE TO TEACHERS' STRIKE 
 
REF: ABIDJAN 789 
 
¶1.  On November 9, 2006, the Primary School Teachers, 
Movement for the Defense of their Rights, known as Mouvement 
des Instituteurs pour la Defense de leurs Droits (MIDD), 
launched a strike to protest the government's failure to 
grant USD 80 (CFAF 40,000) per month in housing allowances 
for primary school teachers.  State primary schools have been 
shut down throughout the country as all primary school 
teachers, including the minority of teachers not formally of 
the MIDD, have been on strike.  On November 15, 2006, the 
Ministry of Education held talks with the MIDD members, but 
no agreement was reached on this key grievance.  Though not 
officially recognized as a legal union (they have applied for 
such status in April 2006) the MIDD is a powerful movement 
made up of roughly 30,000 public sector primary school 
teachers out of a total of 35,000 in Cote d'Ivoire. 
 
¶2.  This is the second strike the MIDD has launched since 
June.  In June 2006 (reftel), the MIDD went on strike to draw 
the government's attention to the housing problems that are 
common among primary school teachers.  Following initial 
talks, the Ministry of Education agreed to create an 
inter-ministerial committee, comprised of representatives of 
the MIDD as well as from the Ministries of Education, Labor, 
and Finance, to analyze the demands.  Trusting the 
initiative, the MIDD ended its strike on July 31, 2006 and 
proceeded with the normal process of grading year-end exams 
that took place on August 1. 
 
¶3.  Since the creation of the committee, the government has 
failed to take any further action.  Denouncing the 
ineffectiveness of the committee and also questioning the 
sincerity of the government in creating it, the MIDD says it 
will continue the strike until a decree granting the housing 
allowance is signed.  In addition, private primary school 
teachers met with the Minister of Integration on November 27 
to discuss similar grievances with salary issues. 
 
¶4.  Comment:  Though the demanded amount per teacher is 
relatively small, the collective amount owed if the decree is 
signed is over 1.5 billion CFAF (roughly 2.8 million USD) per 
month.  Resolution of this issue requires consensus from the 
Ministry of Finance, which may be difficult given the total 
sums involved and the ongoing political situation that has 
occupied nearly the full attention of the Prime Minister. 
The Ministry of Education will meet with leaders of the MIDD 
on November 28, but until some resolution is reached, the 
majority of Ivorian children are not attending classes.  End 
comment.
