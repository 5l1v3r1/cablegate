SUBJECT: CITY GOVERNMENT RESCINDS MOTORCYCLE BAN 
 
REF: KIGALI 836 
 
¶1. (U) The Kigali City Council on Monday September 4 
rescinded its two-week ban on motorcycle taxis.  Operating 
under new licensing requirements, the motorcycles began to 
return to city streets in small numbers.  Each operator is 
now required to register with his local cell (the 
next-to-lowest political subdivision in Rwanda), obtain an 
operator's permit, and wear a proper uniform and helmet. 
Mayor Aisa Kaycira told us September 5 that the City Council 
stood ready to re-ban the motorcycles if the operators did 
not abide by rules of conduct agreed in joint sessions with 
the police and City Council. 
 
¶2. (U) Comment.  While the Mayor stands by her story (of an 
intentionally brief halt to motorcycle taxis) the City 
Council appears to have belatedly realized it had angered 
poorer residents and brought much criticism upon itself 
(reftel).  The intensity of criticism seems to have caught 
the Council by surprise.  Rumors of Presidential involvement 
in the ban and/or its rescission appear to be just that; 
contacts at the presidency dismissed the idea that President 
Kagame would involve himself in a mundane municipal issue. 
End comment.
