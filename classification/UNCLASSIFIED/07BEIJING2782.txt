Taiwan's Joining WHO Violates WHO Rules 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  In response to a question from a Central China Radio 
reporter about Chen Shui-bian's letter to the Director 
General of the WHO regarding Taiwan membership, Taiwan 
Affairs Office (TAO) spokesman Yang Yi said that because 
Taiwan is a part of China and only sovereign states may join 
the WHO, Taiwan can not join the organization as a "member," 
"associate member" or "observer."  Yang added that attempts 
to join under the name "Taiwan" constitute "Taiwan 
independence" separatist activities and are opposed by Taiwan 
public opinion, the Mainland and the international community. 
 However, he stated that the Mainland highly regards and 
protects the health rights of the Taiwan people and 
vigorously promotes exchange and cooperation in this field. 
Since a memorandum of understanding was signed by China and 
the WHO in May 2005, the Mainland has actively supported 
Taiwan's health experts' attendance at WHO-sponsored 
activities, added Yang. 
 
Lien-Hu Meeting Still Under Consultation 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Asked for details of a possible meeting between President 
Hu and Honorary KMT Chairman Lien Chan who is currently 
visiting the Mainland for the Third CCP-KMT sponsored 
"Cross-Strait Forum on Trade and Culture" to be held April 
28-29 in Beijing, Yang said that specific arrangements are 
still being discussed. 
 
Kaohsiung Vice-Mayor Denied Visa 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Asked repeatedly for the reason behind Kaohsiung City 
Vice-Mayor Cheng Wen-long's inability to get a visa to the 
Mainland, Yang responded that the initial list of members for 
a delegation of Kaohsiung representatives to the Mainland did 
not include Cheng, whose name was added at the last minute. 
Thus, there was not enough time to process his application. 
Yang downplayed a reporter's suggestion that Cheng's 
political leanings led to his visa's refusal as 
"over-complicating" the issue. 
 
Trade and Culture Forum: Education and Tourism 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶5.  The spokesman called attention to education, tourism and 
direct links as the main topics of the Cross-Strait Forum on 
Trade and Culture, which is expected to draw nearly 300 
Taiwan representatives and almost 200 from the Mainland. 
Yang listed examples of educational exchange, but complained 
that Taiwan authorities hinder cooperation by not recognizing 
Mainland academic qualifications and by promoting so-called 
"de-Sinification" activities.  Asked about intentions to 
restrict the opening of schools for children of Taiwan 
businessmen on the Mainland, Yang denied such plans and cited 
the existence of three schools in Jiangsu, Guangdong and 
Shanghai with a combined total of 2,700 students. 
 
¶6.  On the topic of tourism, Yang reiterated the Mainland's 
support for Mainland residents' travel to Taiwan, but accused 
those who hinder the realization of Mainland tourists to 
Taiwan of being irresponsible to people on both sides of the 
Strait. 
 
Spying Accusations, TAO Personnel Speculation 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  Yang scoffed at reporters' suggestions of Mainland spies 
in Taiwan, refusing to give a comment on the issue.  The 
spokesman also declined to comment on speculation that TAO 
Economic Director He Shizhong might soon be replaced by Xu 
Mang, Director of Personnel at TAO. 
 
Pan-Blue Coalition Illegal 
 
BEIJING 00002782  002 OF 002 
 
 
-------------------------- 
 
¶8.  In response to a reporter's question about alleged 
arrests and beatings of Mainland activists belonging to the 
self-described "Pan-Blue Coalition," (a group of political 
activists based in Central China) the spokesman stated that 
the "so-called" "Pan-Blue Coalition" has not gone through 
proper registration channels and their activities are 
illegal.  Yang stated that this situation has nothing to do 
with the KMT. 
 
Olympic Torch Route Announcement Tomorrow 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  Responding to questions about whether the Olympic torch 
would pass through Taiwan before the 2008 Games, Yang 
confirmed that the relevant information will be released 
tomorrow. 
 
Taiwan Investment Group Under TAO Supervision 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  Asked about the relationship between the newly 
established Federation of Taiwan Compatriots Investments and 
Enterprises and the TAO, Yang clarified that according to law 
the TAO is the department responsible for the Federation's 
service management, guidance and supervision.
