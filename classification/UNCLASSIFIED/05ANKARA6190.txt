BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 
 
 
¶1. (U) During an October 11 meeting with visiting State 
EUR/SE Director Doug Silliman, Foreign Trade Undersecretariat 
(FTU) Director General of Agreements Tevfik Mengu said that 
the upcoming November 30 Trade and Investment Framework 
Agreement (TIFA) Council meeting provides an opportunity for 
Turkey to promote its improved business environment to US 
companies.  He agreed that it could be useful to hold private 
sector related events on the margins of the TIFA.  He 
acknowledged that there were bilateral trade issues (e.g. IPR 
and agricultural issues) that must be addressed but added 
that FTU will also brief the US delegation on its 2006 "Year 
of America" campaign during which FTU Minister Kursad Tuzmen 
hopes to strengthen trade relations with North and South 
America. 
 
¶2. (U) On the subject of the head of the Turkish TIFA 
delegation (currently FTU Deputy Undersecretary Ulker Guzel 
is slated to lead the GOT delegation), Mengu said he would 
speak again with FTU Undersecretary Tuncer Kayalar about the 
issue and "try to solve the problem" so that Kayalar would 
lead the Turkish side.  FTU Head of the Agreements Department 
Cigdem Kilickaya, who attended the meeting, however, pointed 
out that FTU Deputy Undersecretary Abdullah Koten led the GOT 
delegation at the 2002 TIFA meeting. 
 
¶3. (U) Comment:  We will continue working with FTU to 
encourage Kayalar's participation as the lead Turkish 
official.  Post would also like to work with USTR and other 
Washington agencies to flesh out the concept of 
business-oriented events on the margins of the TIFA Council. 
End comment.
