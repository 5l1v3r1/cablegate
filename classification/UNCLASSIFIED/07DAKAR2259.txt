SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In a November 13 meeting hosted by the French Embassy, 
Rosaline Idowu, Regional representative for the UN High Commission 
for Refugees (UNHCR), said that UNHCR and the governments of Senegal 
and Mauritania had signed an agreement to repatriate Mauritanian 
refugees living in Senegal.  The process is expected to begin after 
a three-day National Forum, to be held Nouakchott, irons out any 
outstanding problems not addressed in the repatriation agreement. 
Out of an estimated 30,000 refugees, at least 24,000 are expected to 
return.  The refugees will not sign a repatriation agreement until 
the National Forum is held. End Summary 
 
¶2. (U) After years of neglect by the Mauritanian government, 
Senegal's Mauritanian refugees will be able to go home as soon as 
early December, said UNHCR's Rosaline Idowu following the signing of 
a repatriation agreement by the GOS and GOM on November 12.  Before 
the repatriations begin, Mauritanian President Sidi Ould Cheikh 
Abdallahi will lead a National Forum November 19-21 in Nouakchott, 
to try to get to grips with remaining contentious issues such as who 
is a Mauritanian.  For example, many nomadic Peul people, who are 
native to both Senegal and Mauritania, have no papers and roam 
hundreds of kilometers with their herds.  The government and 
representatives of the refugees still need to agree on how the 
re-insertion will take place, how property that has been seized or 
occupied by "Arab" Mauritanians will be returned to repatriated 
black "African" Mauritanians or new properties distributed. 
Moreover, the two sides need to decide who will get compensated for 
what and whether refugees be able to return to their old jobs.  The 
government of Mauritania is not expected to set up tribunals to 
punish the perpetrators of crimes committed during the 1989 conflict 
but will acknowledge that crimes were committed and recognize those 
who have lost someone.

¶3. (SBU) Idowu pointed out that this is a very sensitive process and 
that if Mauritian President Abdallahi is not successful it may have 
repercussions for his administration.  She agreed that the 
Mauritanian government is still an extremely fragile one and that 
international assistance both financially and politically would go a 
long way in bringing about a successful resolution to a problem that 
has not been resolved in close to twenty years. In reply to a 
question from PolOff about who would pay for it, she wryly said that 
the United States and European countries would be the first to be 
asked to assist in providing the USD 7 million billion needed to 
implement the repatriation.
