SUBJECT: FATAL EXPLOSION IN LATTAKIA PORT 
 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Local and international press reported widely 
yesterday a huge explosion in the Lattakia port that resulted 
in eighteen injuries, one death and the destruction of up to 
four grain silos as well as the system of conveyor belts that 
connects them.  Dr. Mohammad Fadel, manager of a major grain 
and soybean importing company, confirmed news reports that 
the explosion occurred from the combustion of thick and very 
volatile grain dust, which he said can explode with the force 
of TNT.  He stated that at the time of the explosion the port 
was busy handling a large shipment of wheat and barley, and 
that the old concrete silos, which lacked ventilation and 
were not managed by established safety standards, quickly 
filled with dust.  Fadel continued that workmen concurrently 
were welding parts of the conveyor system that connects the 
silos, and the sparks from the welding caused the dust to 
explode. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Other contacts state that the 25-50% decrease in 
capacity of the Lattakia port for grain shipments will put an 
increased strain on Syria's already limited port and grain 
storage facilities.  Contacts further state that this could 
have a serious effect on transit shipments of commodities to 
Iraq, potentially causing longer delays and increased prices 
for freight and transportation.  Fadel stated that he and 
other importers are beginning to shift their business to the 
port in Tartous, where currently there is a wait of at least 
ten days before ships can unload their cargo.  Fadel expects 
the wait to increase by at least five days with the addition 
of the Lattakia traffic.
