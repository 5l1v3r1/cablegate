¶1.  (U) Pol/Econoff delivered remarks from instruction email 
to Janne Jokinen, First Secretary in the Unit for Human 
Rights Policy at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  Jokinen 
stated that Finland will join the EU statement but will not 
be issuing a separate statement or taking any other action 
related to the February 11 founding date of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran.  He did reinforce that Finland will be 
questioning Iran at the upcoming U.N. UPR process. 
 
¶2.  (U) Per instruction reftel STATE 07242, Pol/Econoff spoke 
with Jokinen on 27 January, 2010 regarding the GOF submitting 
questions to Iran during the UPR process.  The GOF will focus 
its questions to Iran on extra judicial arrests, the rights 
of detainees and the rights of women.  GOF is also seriously 
concerned about the legal process preceding executions and 
that minors are eligible for the death penalty.  However, the 
GOF does not think that it has enough time in the UPR to 
question Iran on execution-related issues in the two minutes 
alloted.  Expanded details of this conversation can be found 
in reftel HELSINKI 0038.
