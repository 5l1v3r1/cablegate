¶1.  Summary:  To further the PresidentQs Freedom 
Agenda (Ref A), the Ambassador, DCM and other Mission 
officers have met with a variety of activists and 
interlocutors to highlight the importance of continued 
democratic and human rights reforms in strengthening 
MoroccoQs position as a moderate, democratic-leaning 
regime.  Among other successes, our outreach resulted 
in MoroccoQs eventual agreement to permit international 
observation of September 2007 parliamentary elections. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2.  In order to maximize impact, the MissionQs 
engagement has been built around the three elements 
DRL PDAS Farrar identified as crucial to sustained 
human rights progress:  a) free and fair electoral 
processes; b) representative, accountable, and 
transparent democratic institutions of government; and 
c) vibrant, independent civil societies, including 
NGOs and free media.  Per ref B request, below are 
representative examples of mission engagement in these 
key areas. 
 
¶3.  Free and Fair Elections:  On July 10, 2007, the 
Ambassador met with Ahmed Herzenni, former long-time 
political prisoner and current head of the 
Consultative Council on Human Rights (CCDH), the 
national body that advises the Government of Morocco 
(GOM) and King on human rights questions.  They 
discussed a variety of human rights issues, including 
the need for Morocco to allow international 
observation of the September 2007 parliamentary 
elections as a sign of improved transparency.  The 
Ambassador and the Mission as whole had been engaging 
on this topic for several months with the broader 
Government, but within seven days of the meeting with 
Herzenni, the GOM announced an agreement between the 
CCDH and the U.S.-based National Democratic Institute 
to manage an international election observation 
effort. 
 
¶4.  Transparent Democratic Institutions:  The GOM, 
civil society, and the international community have 
all identified corruption as one of the key obstacles 
to continued reform in all fields.  The Ambassador has 
made anti-corruption one of his highest priorities. 
As part of his engagement on the issue, he sought out 
members of Transparency Maroc (TM), the Morocco 
affiliate of Transparency International.  TM has 
boycotted official contact with Embassy personnel for 
over two years as a protest over some of the USGQs 
Middle East policies.  The Ambassador was able to work 
out a mutually satisfactory agreement for an 
informal/unofficial meeting on February 5 with TMQs 
Chairman at the Ambassdor's residence that resulted in 
a constructive discussion on corruption as a human rights 
issue.  Furthermore, the Ambassador engaged directly with 
leaders and members of the newly elected Parliament, a 
keystone of the Mission's democracy promotion strategy. 
 
¶5.  Rule of Law:  To promote the rule of law in 
Morocco, the U.S. is training judges and working with 
the Ministry of Justice to improve prison conditions. 
The Ambassador has also worked closely with the 
American Bar Association to support its efforts to 
promote the rule of law. 
 
¶6.  Vibrant Civil Society:  As part of our broader 
efforts to support civil society and encourage 
activists, the Ambassador met on July 10 with 
President of the Moroccan Organization for Human 
Rights Amina Bouayach.  Bouayach, a prominent activist 
who speaks out on a variety of issues including 
womenQs rights, prison conditions, freedom of 
expression and police brutality, thanked the 
Ambassador for USG support for freedom and democracy 
but also challenged the Ambassador on perceived 
inconsistencies in the field of human rights in its 
relations with Morocco.  The frank but respectful 
discussion that followed is similar to events with 
 
other activists and civil society representatives. 
The Ambassador regularly meets with civil society 
activists in Rabat, Casablanca, and throughout 
Morocco including advocates for women's, children's, 
and disability rights.  For his part, the DCM 
recently began a series of speeches on human rights 
for student groups in Rabat and Sale.  Ongoing USAID 
and public diplomacy programs support party and 
parliamentary strengthening, good governance 
especially at the municipal and provincial levels, 
and training for journalists. 
 
¶7.  Free Media:  The Ambassador has also spoken out 
clearly and often on the need to protect freedom of 
the press in Morocco.  During a live television 
interview on March 11, 2008, on the occasion of the 
publication of the Country Reports on Human Rights 
Practices for 2007, the Ambassador explicitly 
mentioned press freedom as an area for concern and 
improvement.  The Ambassador and the Mission have 
also repeatedly advocated the passage of a new press 
code that would decriminalize defamation, and he has 
voiced opposition to restrictions on opinion polling. 
 
¶8.  Comment:  Both before and after the PresidentQs 
2007 Prague speech (Ref A), the Ambassador and other 
staff engaged with the Government and civil society at 
all levels to encourage continued progress on reforms. 
Through our annual Human Rights Dialogue with the 
Government and contacts with activists, we participate 
in constructive and sometimes pointed discussions on 
human rights issues, including Western Sahara, where a 
higher degree of abuses persists.  We will continue 
our contacts and relationships with activists and 
civil society members to further the PresidentQs 
Freedom Agenda.  End Comment.
