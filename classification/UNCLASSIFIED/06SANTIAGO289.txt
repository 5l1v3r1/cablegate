Agriculture Attache contacted German King, Director, APEC Dept, 
Chilean Economic Directorate, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding 
reftel request.  King reported he was unable to respond at this time 
regarding co-sponsoring the U.S. proposal, but the general 
inter-agency response was supportive of the initiative.  He will 
endeavor to provide the formal Chilean response by February 13. King 
noted that he also needed to consult further with government and 
industry contacts regarding whether Chile wants to include the June 
2003 apple incident as part of the case studies for the project.
