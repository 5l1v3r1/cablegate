SUBJECT: TAIWAN RE-STAFFS THE IPR POLICE FORCE 
 
REF: TAIPEI 1289 
 
¶1.  Taiwan's National Police Adminstration (NPA) has restored 
the IPR Police to full strength after reassigning 35 officers 
to address public security needs in summer 2005.  According 
to IPR Police Commander Liao Kao-jiang, the IPR Police now 
has 208 full-time staff members plus 20 conscripts who are 
serving in the unit as an alternative to military service. 
 
¶2.  The IPR Police have offices in Taoyuan, Taichung, Jiayi, 
Kaohsiung, and Hualien in addition to its headquarters in 
Taipei.  Commander Liao believes his team is now fully 
staffed and does not foresee any reductions in staffing in 
the near future. 
 
¶3.  Comment: The IPR Police Unit was created as an ad hoc 
task force in 2002 and established as a permanent unit in 
2004 with a complement of 220 full time staff.  However, 
normal rotations and a shortage of qualified personnel kept 
the unit staff at about 210-215 persons before the 
reassignment of 35 officers to public security duties last 
year.  The IPR Police were not the only unit to suffer 
personnel cuts.  The environmental protection police unit was 
reportedly completely disbanded to facilitate the transfer of 
staff to pubic security duties.  In spite of reduced staff 
over the past year, the IPR Police have successfully 
conducted many investigations againt optical media, branded 
goods, and pharmaceutical counterfeiters and have expanded 
their attention to on-line piracy.  The restaffing to 
previous levels demonstrates Taiwan authorities ontinued 
determination to address intellectual property violations and 
should lead to increased enforcement actions in the next 
year.  Reftel had recommended that IPR Police staffing be a 
topic in the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) 
discussions scheduled for May 25-26.  In light of the 
restored staffing levels, we recommend this topic be dropped 
from the agenda.  End Comment.
