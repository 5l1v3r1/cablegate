SUBJECT: USAID PARTICIPATION IN WORLD OCEANS CONFERENCE 
 
REF: JAKARTA 266 
 
¶1.  This is an action message.  See paragraph 6. 
 
¶2.  Summary:  The May 11-15 World Ocean Conference (WOC) in Manado, 
Indonesia will be a key climate chage milestone on the way to 
Copenhagen.  In addition to climate change, the Conference will 
address sustainable economic growth and biodiversity conservation, 
and advance our regional and bilateral partnerships in Southeast 
Asia.  USAID, as the largest investor of resources to support marine 
resource management in this region, should send its highest level 
representative possible and an appropriate delegation to support 
this conference. 
 
¶3.  This first World Ocean Conference will be the most significant 
international event held thus far to focus on how oceans influence 
and are influenced by climate change.  It will culminate in the 
signing of the Manado Ocean Declaration.  This Declaration will 
highlight the role of the ocean in regulating climate change and the 
importance of protecting the ocean to mitigate and adapt to climate 
change.  The conference and declaration will influence the 
development of global oceans policy and focus attention on 
ocean-climate change linkages in the lead-up to Copenhagen.  Marine 
resources are also crucial for the economy, society, and 
biodiversity priorities of the region.  The right American 
delegation can advance our views in all these subjects, and USAID 
leadership is key. 
 
¶4.  Environment, science and technology are key pillars of the 
USG-GOI and regional ASEAN relationships.  Strong USG support of the 
WOC would advance the Coral Triangle Initiative, support sustainable 
marine resource management in this critical area, advance USG 
climate objectives, and demonstrate progress under our regional and 
bilateral partnerships.  Indonesians are expecting 2,500 
participants from over 100 countries, including government 
officials, scientists, NGO representatives and journalists.  The six 
Coral Triangle Initiative heads of state are planning to come, as 
well as Prime Minister Rudd from Australia.  The U.S., a key CTI 
partner, needs to be there as well. 
 
¶5.  Ambassador Hume has requested a senior USG envoy to coordinate 
interagency efforts, engage quickly in the region with GOI and other 
governments, and to shape environmental, scientific and climate 
change messages (see reftel).  USAID, which invests more heavily 
than any other USG agency in marine resource management, has a 
direct interest in the Conference's outcome and needs to push for 
this high-level Washington envoy.  USAID will have a booth at the 
WOC, currently being planned by its RDMA mission in Bangkok. 
 
¶6.  Action:  Ambassador Hume requests USAID to send the strongest 
possible team to the WOC and to prepare for this important event.
