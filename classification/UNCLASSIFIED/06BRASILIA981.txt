SUBJECT: BRAZIL ENRICHES URANIUM AND RENEWS CALLS FOR ANGRA III 
 
¶1. Summary: In addition to renewed speculation regarding the resumed 
construction of Angra III, Brazil also entered an exclusive club of 
7 nations worldwide with the capacity to dominate the complete 
nuclear fuel cycle.  Following a discreet inauguration ceremony, 
Brazil detailed its short-term goal of becoming self-sufficient in 
uranium production/enrichment by 2016/17.  This takes into account 
the projected needs of a completed Angra III.  Simultaneously, 
Bolivia's decision to nationalize its gas-fields has spurred Brazil 
to renew its search for sustainable, domestic supplies of energy. 
The most evident short-term solution is Angra III. End Summary 
 
¶2. On May 5, the GoB inaugurated the first cascade of its first 
enrichment module in a final test at Brazil's enrichment facility in 
Resende.  Another eight cascades are expected to be on-line by 2010 
with the capacity to generate 60% of Brazil's fuel needs.  The 
inaugural module is one of four enrichment units, one with four 
cascades and the others with 2, requiring approximately US$ 50 
million in investments.  The event marked the conclusion of a series 
of tests begun in 2005, and was the first to involve uranium.  INB 
already has the capacity to reconvert uranium, fabricate pastilles 
and to assemble fuel units for use in Angra I and II.  This does not 
mean, however, that Brazil is in a position to enrich uranium on an 
industrial scale.  The enrichment facility still requires licensing 
permits from CNEN (Brazil's National Nuclear Energy Commission) and 
Ibama (Brazilian Environmental Protection Agency).  Both are 
considered routine, and one officer in CNEN's International 
Relations officers relayed a belief to Scioff, though claiming to 
not have access to the information, that the permits would be 
granted sometime within the next three to six months. 
 
¶3. Coinciding with this inauguration, there are renewed calls to 
finish construction of Brazil's Angra III reactor.  Construction of 
Angra III was halted in 1992 due to a lack of resources.  However, 
recent events, most notably the nationalization of Bolivia's oil and 
gas fields, have apparently convinced Brazil that it would be well 
served by investing in additional atomic energy capacity.  In the 
fallout of the Bolivia gas crisis, Wagner Victer, Secretary of Rio 
de Janeiro's Energy, Naval Industry and Oil, estimated that Angra 
III would decrease Brazilian dependence on Bolivian natural gas by 7 
million cubic meters per day.  This is equivalent to 30% of the 
Brazil's yearly gas imports.  Angra III would generate 1,300 MW and 
construction would require close to U.S.$ 2 billion in investments. 
 
 
¶4. As recently as April, during the last meeting of Brazil's 
National Energy Council (CNPE) there was agreement that the project 
is viable.  Media reports claim that even the project's fiercest 
opponent, Dilma Rousseff (Lula's Chief of Staff), has capitulated in 
the dispute.  Othon Luiz Pinheiro (Director of Electronuclear) 
added, "there exists a great possibility that the Angra III project 
will be approved at the next meeting of CNPE" schedule for June. 
The Minister of Science and Technology, meanwhile, noted that CNEN 
is preparing a report about the construction of Angra III for 
President Lula to determine whether works should be reinitiated. 
 
¶5. The change of heart is, as in most cases, fueled by economics. 
Nuclear power is showing itself economically viable against other 
forms of energy.  Previously considered an impediment, the cost of 
producing atomic energy is now in line with the energy supplied by 
thermal and hydroelectric plants.  In fact, the projected value of 
power produced by Angra III is on par with the energy sold during 
previous energy auctions in December of 05.  Prior to the gas crisis 
with Bolivia, thermal energy from gas was priced at R$ 137/MWh as 
compared to R$ 140/MWh when Angra III would begin operation in 2012. 
 Hubner Morreira, Interim Minister of Mines and Energy, recently 
stated, that the GoB has not only admitted the economic viability of 
Angra III but is also studying the legislative changes necessary to 
commercialize it. 
 
¶6. Comment: With a proven capacity to enrich uranium and a continued 
emphasis on self-sufficient energy generation, Brazil appears to be 
closer than ever to embracing nuclear energy expansion. End Comment
