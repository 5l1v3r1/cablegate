DEPLOYMENT 
 
¶1. (U) On October 22, the 101-member Estonian 
Parliament (Riigikogu) voted to extend the mandate for 
the Estonian troop deployment in Afghanistan by 12 
months (until December 31, 2009).  Estonia troops are 
embedded with British units in the Helmand province of 
southern Afghanistan.  The current mandate (valid 
until December 31, 2008) allows Estonia to contribute 
as many as 150 defense force members to the ISAF 
mission. The new mandate increases the number of 
troops authorized to participate in the mission to 
¶170.  The bill passed Parliament with a majority of 59 
votes in favor and no votes opposing.  MPs from two of 
the three members of the governing coalition, Reform 
Party and Social Democratic party, overwhelmingly 
voted in favor of extending the mandate.  However, 
only half of the members of IRL (the remaining 
coalition member and the party of the Minister of 
Defense) and 13 members of the primary opposition 
Center Party, voted in favor of the bill.  Altogether, 
30 MPs (primarily members of opposition parties) did 
not vote at all. In 2007, the extension of the 
Afghanistan mandate passed with 69 votes in favor and 
none opposed. 
 
¶2.  (U) Afghanistan is one of Estonia's highest 
foreign policy priorities.  Estonian troops have 
served in southern Afghanistan since 2002.  There are 
currently 140 Estonian soldiers deployed in Helmand 
(the epicenter of Afghanistan's opium production and a 
stronghold for the Taliban).  The primary unit is a 
mechanized infantry company and a mortar platoon. 
Estonia began providing development assistance to 
Afghanistan in 2002, donating more than USD 336,000 
from 2002-2007 with an emphasis on the health sector. 
In March 2008, the GOE sent a civilian medical advisor 
to Helmand to support the development of a sustainable 
healthcare system in the province and to help 
coordinate international aid.
