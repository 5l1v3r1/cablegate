AMCITS IN MERSIN, TURKEY 
 
REF: A. TASK FORCE ONE-DUTY OFFICER 7/19 CALL 
     ¶B. ANKARA 4154 
     ¶C. SECSTATE 7843 
 
¶1. (U) In response to Task Force information (ref A) that 
AmCits may be arriving in the Turkish port city of Mersin on 
7/19, Mission made contingency preparations to accommodate 
and process. 
 
¶2. (U) Initial information that 100 ) 200 AmCits would 
arrive late July 19 in Mersin on a Canadian-chartered fast 
ferry is no longer current.  According to the Canadian 
Embassy in Ankara, the ferry had difficulties entering Beirut 
harbor and will seek to reenter on 7/20.  Canadian Embassy 
further reports that the ferry will be carrying Canadians, 
Australians, AmCits and Singaporians.  They estimate the 
ferry will arrive in Mersin on the evening of 7/20. 
 
¶3. (U) A Consulate/Incirlik team will be prepared to meet any 
incoming boat.  Via a combination of commercial and Incirlik 
buses, to be escorted by Turkish National Police, they would 
proceed to a secure area at Incirlik for processing, checking 
of documents, issuing of emergency passports, signing 
promissory notes, etc.  Incirlik is capable of providing 
billets and food for up to 800 AmCits at any one time.  We 
are looking into, in conjunction with CA, the possibility of 
bringing chartered aircraft into Incirlik to fly any AmCits 
out of Turkey. 
 
¶4. (U) We will continue to coordinate closely with the 
Canadians.  The Canadians plan to transport their citizens to 
a holding place ) a local stadium that they have rented for 
the purpose - to do triage and process them there (both for 
Turkish customs purposes and Canadian entry requirements). 
They will then be flown out of Adana civilian airport the 
morning of July 21 on chartered planes. 
 
¶5. (U) Mission Turkey remains ready to receive any AmCits who 
arrive in Turkey on the Canadian charters or other vessels. 
The Turkish Government has pledged their full support and 
cooperation for our evacuation efforts.  We await further 
guidance on what additional assistance Mission can provide to 
the evacuation effort.
