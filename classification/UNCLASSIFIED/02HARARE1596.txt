SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT ZIMPAPERS BACK ON THE BOURSE; HARARE 
 
The state-controlled Zimbabwe Newspapers Group (Zimpapers) 
is back on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE), three days 
after being suspended for flouting the bourse's regulations 
and Companies Act requirements.  The former blue-chip 
company was suspended on Monday, July 1 after it failed to 
produce and circulate its audited results to shareholders 
as stipulated by the stock exchange.  However, the 
suspension was lifted on July 4 after the group managed to 
release and circulate its belated audited accounts, that 
posted a staggering Z$106 million loss, to shareholders and 
the announcement of its annual general meeting, now 
scheduled for July 25.  Zimpapers shares have been trading 
below 100 cents and last year it was among the strong 
contenders for the wooden-spoon award on the ZSE.  Analysts 
say "the poor results mirror the negative light" in which 
its six titles are seen by the public.
