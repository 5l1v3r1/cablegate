SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED - MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE FOR 
KHMER ROUGE TRIBUNAL 
 
REF: STATE 126728 
 
¶1.  (U) We provided reftel points July 8 to MFA IO Asia 
action officer Didier Gonzalez.  Gonzalez told us July 9 that 
the GoF had no position on the establishment of a Management 
Committee.  The idea, he said, would require some reflection. 
 
 
¶2. (U) We also provided the points to MFA Cambodia desk on 
July 11.  When we sought a response from the South-East Asia 
Directorate, the desk officer informed us that, as the issues 
involved with the Management Committee fell across several 
offices' areas of responsibility, they were still consulting 
internally in order to provide a response. 
 
¶3. (U) Embassy will report when we have a response from the 
GOF.
