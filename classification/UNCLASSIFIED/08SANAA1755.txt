SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DECLARES DISASTER IN HADRAMOUT AND MAHRA 
 
¶1. Summary and Action Request: Ambassador Seche declares a 
humanitarian disaster in the Hadramout and Mahra governorates of 
eastern Yemen following a tropical storm and related flash flooding 
that occurred between October 23 and October 25.  The Ambassador 
requests that DCHA/OFDA immediately commit USD 50,000 to pay for 
transport of emergency nutritional support to the region.  The funds 
will be used by the World Food Program. End summary. 
 
¶2. Background: on October 23 a tropical storm designated Tropical 
Storm Three struck Hadramout and Mahra in Eastern Yemen.  The 
remoteness of some of the affected areas and impassible roads have 
hindered needs assessment and complete information on the scope of 
the damage is still not available.  The ROYG's Crisis Center 
informed the donor community on October 27 that there are 180 dead, 
circa 40 missing, 10,000 internally displaced persons and 2,000 
homes destroyed.  Oxfam estimates that between 700 and 1000 homes 
have been destroyed in the city of Seyoun alone.  Deputy Prime 
Minister al-Arhabi appealed to the donor community for assistance in 
the form of:  foodstuffs, tents, water purification, temporary 
bridges, pumping equipment, medicine, and other items. Most homes 
and other buildings in outlying areas are constructed of mud and so 
are particularly vulnerable to damage from flooding.  Medecins Sand 
Frontieres is concerned about water-borne diseases and notes that 
there were known cases of cholera in the region prior to the 
flooding. 
 
¶3.  Hadramout and Mahra have a combined total population of 1.17 
million. Numerous roads in the region are impassible and electricity 
and telephone service are spotty at best.  Limited access and 
communication with the affected areas continues to hamper full 
assessments and relief operations.  There are currently two rapid 
assessment teams in the region, one from the United Nations, and one 
from the Yemeni government.  It is likely that information will 
continue to come in over the next few days. 
 
¶4.  Numerous private individuals and regional governments have 
pledged support but as of October 27 only the ROYG-led efforts are 
actually providing assistance on the ground.  Military sources 
report the ROYG is flying in supplies to the region with fixed wing 
aircraft.  The World Food Program is transporting 16 tons of food to 
the region and has asked for financial assistance from the embassy. 
The embassy is working with CENTCOM to coordinate DoD-funded, 
in-kind assistance. 
 
¶5. Mission will keep addressees updated as additional information 
becomes available.
