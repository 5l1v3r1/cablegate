REF: A) EUC request 01210087 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a post shipment verification (PSV) of a shipment destined to 
Corezing International Co., Ltd., Shop A1, 287 Cleverly Street, Hong 
Kong.  The items in question for this PSV are 256 low noice 
amplifiers exported to Corezing on or about February 29, 2008. 
According to the exporter, these items are classified under Export 
Control Classification Number (ECCN) 3A001b2d, meaning that they are 
controlled for national security reasons and would require a license 
for export/reexport to mainland China but may be shipped license 
free if for use in Hong Kong.  The exporter was Antennas and 
Components of Andover, Massachusetts. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Corezing has been 
in existence since July 2007.  Its paid up share capital is the Hong 
Kong equivalent of USD 65,000.  The Hong Kong Companies Registry 
lists Luo, Jie (with Mainland passport number 441481198206082304) 
and Zhou, Zhenyong (with Mainland passport number 
441900198910161558) as directors.  Corezing in Hong Kong is related 
to a range of Hong Kong and Singapore based companies.  Those 
companies are the subject of ongoing investigations and a recently 
published temporary denial order (TDO).  That TDO restricts the 
ability of those companies to acquire products that are subject to 
the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). 
 
¶4.  The shipment address for this transaction corresponds to a 
currency exchange booth, namely Tung Kee Money Exchange Company 
(Tung Kee).  According to the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department, 
Tung Kee has been in existence since 2003.  It is a sole 
proprietorship owned by Mr. To, Ting Ping (with Hong Kong ID 
H379847). 
 
¶5.  On November 11, 2009, ECO and FCS Commercial Assistant Carrie 
Chan visited Tung Kee and met with a Mr. To, the proprietor of the 
business.  The office location is quite small.  Mr. To stated that 
he accepted shipments on behalf of Ms. Luo Jie of Corezing.  Ms. Luo 
came to pick up the shipments after they arrived.  Mr. To stated 
that he was to have been paid for this service but he never received 
payment.  Mr. To also provided an agreement (bearing the Corezing 
stamp) providing Tung Kee with the authority to accept packages on 
Corezing's behalf until 2012.  Mr. To stated that he stopped 
providing this service as it was too much trouble to accept the 
shipments and it interfered with his exchange business.  Mr. To 
stated that he had received less than 10 shipments on Ms. Luo's 
behalf and had stopped doing so two years earlier. 
 
¶6.   When asked how he came to know Ms. Luo, Mr. To stated that he 
had been introduced by a friend (but not a close friend).  Mr. To 
stated that this friend is now located in the United States.  Mr. To 
claimed not to have this friend's phone number now that he had moved 
to the United States. 
 
¶7.  Mr. To stated that he had no documentation related to the order 
having given it all to Ms. Luo. 
 
¶8.  ECO believes Corezing and Tung Kee to be a unsuitable recipients 
of U.S. origin technology.  ECO recommends a close review of all 
shipments to Corezing and Tung Kee (and its address).
