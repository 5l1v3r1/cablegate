SUBJECT: SAUDI ARABIA NOT IMPOSING SECONDARY BOYCOTT ON 
COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS WQISRQ 
 
¶1. (U) After rQding a recent article in the Jerusalem PostQ 
sQesting the Saudi governmenQ"iQsifying its 
enforcement of the Arab LQgue boycott" on companies doing 
business with Israel, the Embassy contacted both the Ministry 
of Commerce and Industry and several American Qinesses 
operating in the Kingdom for comment.  Senior interlocutors 
in the Ministry, the American Businessmen's Group of Riyadh, 
and American companies operating here in the Kingdom stated 
that the Kingdom has taken no action towards reinstating a 
secondary or tertiary boycott of Israel.  One company 
president noted that in 20 pending procurement negotiations 
there had been no mention of Israel. 
 
¶2. (U) Legally, Saudi Arabia ended its secondary and tertiary 
boycotts of Israel through Council of Ministers Decision No. 
5 of June 13, 1995.  Although there have been isolated 
incidents over the years of American companies being asked to 
comply with aspects of the Arab League boycott, these 
requests have often come from copies of outdated contract 
materials, have been retracted when identified to SAG 
officials, and do not represent official SAG policy.
