SUBJECT: PSI: TURKISH PRESS STATEMENT ON PSI EXERCISE 
ANATOLIAN SUN 06 
 
 
¶1.  The Turkish MFA released an announcement on May 22, 
stating that the PSI exercise "Anatolian Sun" is not directed 
at any one country but an attempt to strengthen international 
cooperation in the fight against proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction.  An informal Embassy translation is at para 
¶2.  (Comment: The MFA statement is an apparent reaction to 
the May 22 New York Times article on the exercise asserting 
it targets Iran among others.  End comment.) 
 
¶2.  Begin text of MFA announcement: 
 
"Our country will host an air-ground-maritime exercise called 
"Anatolian Sun- 2006" on May 24-26 within the framework of 
the Proliferation Security Initiative - PSI.  Implementation 
of the exercise, which does not target any country, includes 
the use of firearms but aims at strengthening coordination 
between relevant authorities with third countries for 
non-proliferation of WMD, WMD delivery systems and other 
related materials.  The decision to conduct the exercise was 
in 2005. 
 
As it is known PSI is established in May 2003 in order to 
cover the deficiencies of existing international agreements, 
arms control regimes and national export control systems to 
prevent proliferation of WMD, WMD delivery systems and other 
related materials.  Turkey announced its support to the 
Initiative in December 2003. 
 
UN Security Council Resolution 1540 on non-proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, adopted unanimously during the 
Council's meeting of April 28, 2004, provides the legal basis 
in international law for the PSI. 
 
"Anatolian Sun 2006" exercise will take place in 2 stages. 
Participants in the desktop stage of the exercise will join 
through their embassies in Ankara or through computer 
connections from their capitals.  USA, France, and Portugal 
will participate in the second stage to be conducted in 
Antalya, and 31 countries will join as observers.  The 
exercise will be open to press and press members will be able 
to watch. 
 
Activities related to the exercise, which were launched 
almost one year ago, have been carried out by about 20 state 
institutions under coordination of Prime Ministry."
