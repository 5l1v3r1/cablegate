Rio-based center-right daily O Globo writes: "COP-15, the 
conference in Copenhagen, starts tomorrow under very different 
circumstances than those of a month or two month ago when it looked 
like a failure (...) In this short period of time, a lot has 
happened. The U.S. adopted an emissions-reduction target of 17% by 
2020 from 2005 levels and 83% until 2050. (...) Brazil announced a 
voluntary commitment to reduce greenhouse gases between 36.1% and 
38.9% before 2020 (...). Having said that, it is good to keep in 
mind that there will be no shortage of problems ahead. Every 
country adopts a different formula to calculate targets. And, even 
in the remote chance that all will be met, they will be 
insufficient, according to a study by consultant Ecofys (...) The 
meeting in Copenhagen cannot be seen as the end of the line, but as 
ground zero. Even with all the difficulties and the proposals' 
limitations it [the Summit] is creating the consensus that it is 
necessary to stop global warming and fight climate change. It is up 
to all participants to work hard for COP-15 to establish the agenda 
for the coming years.(...) There is much work ahead but it can be 
said that the conference is starting with a victory:  for society 
and its institutions that they (...)applied pressure [on their 
governments]  to obligate the world's leaders to accept their 
responsibilities toward future generations." (Sunday, Dec 6, page
