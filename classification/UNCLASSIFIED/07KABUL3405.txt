forwards the names and biodata of thirty Afghan National Police 
Third Sergeants selected for positions in the elite Narcotics 
Interdiction Unit (NIU).  When there are individuals with one name,

actually only have one name.

National Police (ANP) counter-narcotics unit.  They are currently 
scheduled to begin training in approximately two weeks.  Post
