FOR EURASIAN ENERGY DIPLOMACY 
 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  Turkmenistan's state media highlighted U.S. 
Coordinator for Eurasian Energy Diplomacy Steven Mann's January 29 
visit to Turkmenistan.  Mann's meeting with Turkmenistan's President 
Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov received wide state media coverage.  Some 
international media sources characterized the visit as a push for 
the Trans-Caspian Pipeline (TCP), which would bypass Russia en route 
to Europe.  END SUMMARY. 
 
STATE MEDIA INTRODUCE MANN'S VISIT 
 
¶2.  (U) On January 28, the "Watan" TV news program (Turkmen) 
announced Mann's upcoming arrival in Turkmenistan, giving accurate 
details of his planned meetings in the country.  Similar reports on 
the following day appeared on the front pages of the state-run 
dailies "Neytralniy Turkmenistan" (Russian, circ. 43,091) and 
"Turkmenistan" (Turkmen, circ. 29,091). 
 
MEDIA HIGHLIGHT MANN'S MEETING WITH TURKMEN LEADER 
 
¶3.  (U) The January 29 "Watan" TV news program highlighted Mann's 
meeting with President Berdimuhamedov, emphasizing cooperation in 
the fuel and energy sectors.  Mann noted the high interest of 
leading American companies in establishing close business ties with 
Turkmenistan.  The broadcast reported that President 
Berdimuhammedov, congratulated Mann on his new position and 
expressed satisfaction with the pace of development in the ongoing 
Turkmen-American dialogue. 
 
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA CHARACTERIZE VISIT AS ANTI-RUSSIAN 
 
¶4.  (U) On January 29, New York-based EurasiaNet.org," 
The Russian publication "Vremya Novostey," and Russian website 
"NefteGaz.ru" published similar reports that the new Coordinator for 
Eurasian Energy Diplomacy is the centerpiece of the State 
Department's efforts to resist Russia's advance into the Caspian Sea 
Basin.  According to these reports, the purpose of Mann's visit was 
to promote the Trans-Caspian Pipeline project and convince President 
Berdimuhamedov to allow U.S. companies to explore and develop 
Turkmenistan's gas fields. 
 
¶5. (U) COMMENT:  U.S. Coordinator for Eurasian Energy Diplomacy 
Steven Mann's visit received generally accurate and wide Turkmen 
state-media coverage.  Nevertheless, some international news 
sources, especially Russian ones, took the zero-sum-game approach 
and characterized Mann's visit as an attempt to gain influence over 
Turkmenistan and reduce Russia's influence in the Caspian Sea 
region.  END COMMENT.
