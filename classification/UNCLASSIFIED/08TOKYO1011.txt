Sensitive but unclassified.  Please handle accordingly. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Prime Minister Fukuda and French Prime Minister 
Fillon reaffirmed Japan and France see a prominent role for 
nuclear energy in achieving sustainable growth and energy 
security in their respective countries at their meeting in 
Tokyo April 11.  Their joint Declaration on Cooperation in 
the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy also stresses the 
importance of non-proliferation efforts and ensuring the 3Ss 
(safeguards, safety, and security) in introducing nuclear 
power generation in other countries. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  MOFA contacts point out the Declaration does not 
contain new initiatives, but rather is a review of existing 
bilateral and multilateral efforts and prospects for future 
collaboration.  Among bilateral activities are the ongoing 
commercial partnerships to build Japan's Rokkasho 
Reprocessing Plant (which PM Fillon visits April 12) and 
develop next generation nuclear technologies in the U.S., as 
well as research collaboration on fast breeder reactors.  The 
Declaration also notes Japan and France's support for fuel 
cycle initiatives through the Generation IV International 
Forum (GIF) and the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP), 
and their respective contributions to the ITER project. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  MOFA provided Embassy officers with the 
English-language version of the Declaration, which was sent 
to ISN/NESS Richard Nephew and EAP/J Heather Dresser via 
unclassified email. (Note: According to MOFA contacts, the 
 
SIPDIS 
text of the Declaration was negotiated in English and then 
translated into Japanese and French for official release.
