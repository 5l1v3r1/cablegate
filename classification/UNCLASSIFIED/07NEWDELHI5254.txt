Â¶1. (U) Poloff delivered ref A talking points to Royal 
Government of Bhutan (RGOB) First Secretary Karma Choeda on 
December 7, reinforcing the USG desire that the RGOB abstain 
from voting to continue the mandate for the three UN 
Committees named in ref A.  Choeda affirmed that he would 
raise the issue with officials in Thimphu and advised USUN 
communicate directly with the Bhutanese Mission in NY for 
faster results.
