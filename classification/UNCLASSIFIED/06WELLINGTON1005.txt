ASSEMBLY VOTE ON DECEMBER 19, 2006 
 
REF: SECSTATE 199234 
 
In response to reftel, Econoff delivered points to Michelle 
McGillivray, Senior Policy Officer at New Zealand's Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs (MFAT) responsible for UNGA Third 
Committee and Human Rights Issues. MFAT's response made clear 
that New Zealand will not support the "no action" motions and 
will work to defeat these two procedural moves during the UN 
General Assembly's Third Committee which seek to block the 
earlier resolutions condemning human rights abuses in Iran 
and Belarus. MFAT explained that as co-sponsor of the 
Canadian led resolution critical of Iran, it is actively 
seeking support among Pacific Island nations. As to the U.S. 
sponsored resolution critical of Belarus, MFAT has not been 
proactive with Pacific Island nations but will convey the 
U.S. concerns to its team in New York.
