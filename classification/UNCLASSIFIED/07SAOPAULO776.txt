"Sarkozy Adopts Bush's Bellicose Tone" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo's Paris 
correspondent Giles Lapouge commented (9/18): "In regards to Iran, 
'it is necessary to be prepared for the worst, for the war.'  This 
is not VP Dick Cheney's phrase. It was said by French Foreign 
Minister Bernard Kouchner, who has repeated threats made by his 
boss, President Nicolas Sarkozy.... Kouchner has adopted Sarkozy's 
discourse, with a tone that is more bellicose than that of 
Washington.... Now the bellicose offensive conducted by Sarkozy and 
Kouchner is aligned with Washington.... Despite the fact that 
Washington's posture is more diplomatic than Paris, their general 
lines are identical.... The US wants to intimidate Tehran.... 
Bombing Iran would cause a chaos worse that that in Iraq.... Russia 
and China, as well as some Western European nations, are convinced 
that Ahmadinejad's radicalism does not enjoy unanimity not even 
among Iranians. For those nations, diplomatic pressure would force 
the Iranian president to hear the moderate opposition. After all, it 
was through the use of diplomacy that Secstate Condoleezza Rice 
convinced North Korea to give up producing its nuclear bomb.... And 
when one considers the tragedy that a bombing in Iran would cause, 
everything must be tried to prevent bloodshed."
