MACAU CONFIRMS LOCAL TRANSMISSION 
 
REF: A. A) HONG KONG 1065 
     ¶B. B) HONG KONG 1109 
 
¶1.  Summary: The number of H1N1 cases in Hong Kong continues 
to climb, while Macau has gone from zero cases to eight, 
including the first instance of community transmission, in 
the last six days.  In response to the continued outbreak in 
Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Government (HKG) announced June 23 
that all nursery, kindergarten and primary schools would 
suspend classes for the remainder of the school year. 
Macau's Health Bureau raised the pandemic alert level to 6 
following confirmation of the first case of community 
transmission.  End Summary. 
 
Hong Kong ) Rapid Spread but Adequate Response 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2.  Hong Kong continues to experience a rapid surge in the 
number of confirmed H1N1 infections.  60 new cases were 
identified June 23, bringing the total in Hong Kong to 408. 
Most of these cases are now attributed to community 
transmission.  The response measures in place (Ref B) remain 
unchanged and the HKG considers their current response to the 
pandemic to be adequate.  Hong Kong health officials continue 
to review the response measures, however, and can be expected 
to adjust them as warranted by the extent and severity of the 
outbreak. 
 
¶3.  Consistent with earlier statements, the HKG reviewed 
school closures June 23 and made the decision to suspend 
classes for the remainder of the school year for all nursery, 
kindergarten and primary schools (Ref A).  In addition, 
between June 11 and June 23 the HKG ordered 23 secondary 
schools closed, each for a two-week period, after students at 
those schools tested positive for H1N1.  Each of these 
schools will be reviewed and, if determined infection-free by 
the HKG, will be allowed to reopen and resume classes. 
Several of these schools have effectively finished their 
school years and will not reopen, while others will reopen 
for end-of-year testing. 
 
Macau ) Community Transmission Raises Alert Level 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4.  Macau officials identified the first H1N1 case June 18. 
As of June 23, there have been eight confirmed cases.  The 
first community transmission case was confirmed June 23, 
prompting Macau's Health Bureau to raise the pandemic alert 
level to 6, their highest level.  This moves Macau to the 
same response level as Hong Kong and the World Health 
Organization (WHO).  Macau's Pandemic Alert Level 6 has four 
sub-levels, from least (blue) to most severe (red).  The 
current level is 6-blue, indicating a "moderate local 
epidemic situation."  Macau Health Director Lei Chin-ion 
stated that if more than 20 H1N1 patients are hospitalized at 
once, they will move to the next sub-level.  The Health 
Bureau published new response guidance on June 24 that does 
not call for school closures but suspends extracurricular 
activities.  The new guidance also calls for voluntary health 
screening at public venues including government offices, 
hotels and casinos.
