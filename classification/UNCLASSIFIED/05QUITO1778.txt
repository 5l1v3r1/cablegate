SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: ECUADORIAN RELATIONS WITH 
VENEZUELA; TERRORISM 
 
¶1.  "Third Party's Policies," a column (07/28) by 
Rodrigo Fierro in Guayaquil's (and Ecuador's) leading 
center-right "El Universo" (circ. 140,000) 
 
Quote:  ". . . the defense of our interests is taking 
us closer to the policies of the Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela. . .The search for new alternatives 
shows even more clearly how our stagnant 
underdevelopment is sinking us, and that great 
endeavors such as the Free Trade  Agreement, fostered 
as they are by a savage capitalism, will be our 
downfall." 
 
¶2.  "Fight against Terrorism," a column (07/24) by 
Julio Prado Vallejo in Guayaquil's centrist "Expreso" 
(circ. 28,000) 
 
Quote:  "We have to fight against the scourge of 
terrorism, strengthening our political will, 
directing aid towards the strengthening of 
institutional capacities.  Regrettably,  situations 
such as the ones created by the war in Iraq have 
increased terrorism in the Middle East, where, under 
the pretext of fighting against foreign troops, a 
satanic terrorism is being used against civilians and 
military. . .That is why it is even more important 
that the United Nations ratify and enact the 
instruments needed to fight against terrorism. 
 
"This is a job that corresponds to every authority 
and democratic political party either in the 
government or in the opposition, because terrorist 
violence is incompatible with democratic policies and 
societies. . .
