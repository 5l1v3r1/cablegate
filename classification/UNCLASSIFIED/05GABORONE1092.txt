¶1.  SUMMARY:  Civil society organizations in Botswana are 
looking for ways to support the struggle against despotism 
in Zimbabwe.  At a half-day workshop on human rights abuses 
in Zimbabwe, representatives of churches, political parties 
and NGOs condemned the Mugabe regime's atrocities and asked 
a panel of human rights activists from Zimbabwe how they 
could assist in that struggle.  Mission will encourage both 
the GOB and Botswana civil society to use the platform 
provided by the August 17-18 SADC Summit to address the 
crisis of governance in Zimbabwe.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  The Botswana Center for Human Rights, also known as 
Ditshwanelo, hosted a half-day workshop on human rights 
abuses in Zimbabwe on August 4.  A panel of Zimbabweans 
including human rights lawyer Ms. Beatrice Mtetwa; Bishop 
Trevor Manhanga; and Mrs. Jennifer Williams of Women of 
Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) addressed the audience.  They 
described the Mugabe regime's disregard for the rule of law, 
the catastrophic impact of Operation Restore Order upon 
Zimbabwe's urban poor, and the systematic persecution of 
those who demand the right to assemble and speak freely. 
 
¶3.  Following the panel's presentation, Zimbabwe's 
Ambassador to Botswana rose to implore the attendees not to 
believe the panelists alleged "lies."  Mr. Gobe Matenge, a 
wealthy supporter of the Botswana Congress Party, censured 
the Ambassador for attempting to "intimidate" the panel and 
expressed fear for what would happen to them when they 
returned to Zimbabwe.  Joyce Anderson, Director of Emang 
Basadi, the leading women's rights NGO in Botswana, demanded 
thrice that the Ambassador apologize to the assembly and 
also wondered aloud whether the panelists would return to 
their homes safely. 
 
¶4.  Aside from denouncing the Ambassador's flimsy defense of 
the GOZ's policies and practices, several participants asked 
the panelists what they could do to support demands 
fundamental change in Zimbabwe.  Mr. Modise Maphanyane, 
Director of the Botswana chapter of the Media Institute of 
Southern Africa, insisted that the seminar not end in talk 
but lead to some kind of constructive action. 
Representatives of two different religious organizations 
echoed this desire to assist those demanding that the GOZ 
respect their human rights. 
 
¶5.  Noting that Gaborone would host the SADC Summit later 
this month, they again asked what could be done to help. 
Prince Dibeela, a priest at the Botswana synod of the United 
Congregational Church of Southern Africa, noted that 
President Mogae and President Mbeki had "failed us" by 
consistently refusing to acknowledge abuses in Zimbabwe and 
by pursuing "silent diplomacy."  He opined that civil 
society needed to bring pressure upon them to insist upon 
respect for democracy and human rights.  Ditshwanelo plans 
to prepare a report based on the workshop for distribution 
at the SADC Summit and as contribution to deliberations by 
regional NGOs who will meet in Gaborone shortly before the 
Summit. 
 
¶6.  COMMENT:  Post will continue to advocate a more 
constructive approach to the crisis in Zimbabwe by 
encouraging the GOB and civil society to use the August 17- 
18 SADC Summit in Gaborone as a platform to demand that the 
GOZ respect for the principles of democracy and human 
rights.
