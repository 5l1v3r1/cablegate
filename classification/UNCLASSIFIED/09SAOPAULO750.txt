SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: REPRESSION IN IRAN 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (12-30) says: "The 
international repudiation of the Iranian regime's repression, 
censorship and intimidation has been growing [but] Brasilia remains 
an exception......Brazil's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim forgot the 
mess the Lula administration made in the Honduras' case and now 
says one should not interfere in Iran's internal matters.  It's up 
to the Iranians to solve its internal conflicts.  But evidently it 
would be desirable that they did it in a peaceful way, without 
using violence perpetrated by the State.  If Itamaraty were not 
dominated by a militant Manichaeism exhumed from the Cold War, it 
would be simple to articulate this distinction."
