REF: A. SECSTATE 175637 
 
     ¶B. OTTAWA 1968 
 
¶1.  Post has enjoyed strong support from Washington 
counterparts and excellent cooperation with the GOC in 
countering terrorist financing.  We will continue to report 
on developments and strengthen bilateral coordination.  In 
2006, Canada will assume the chair of the Financial Action 
Task Force (ref B) and undergo peer review in early 2007. 
The GOC is also revising anti-money laundering and 
anti-terrorist financing legislation with a view towards 
enhancing its effectiveness and ensuring complete compliance 
with UN and FATF standards. 
 
¶2. Following are responses to the questions in para 7 of Ref 
A: 
 
a)  TFCO is Brian Mohler, Minister-Counselor for Economic 
Affairs, 613-688-5214, mohlerbj at state.gov 
 
b)  Deputy TFCO is Lucy Abbott, First Secretary, Finance and 
Economics, 613-688-5226, abbottlk at state.gov 
 
c)  It would be helpful to have more direct contact with the 
Treasury officer responsible for A-TF activity in Canada. 
 
d)  We will keep these objectives in mind and inform 
Washington should an opportunity arise. 
 
e)  Support from Washington has been excellent.  It is 
helpful to have as much of a heads-up as possible on cases 
that may involve activity in Canada. It would be extremely 
useful to establish a reliable channel in which non-State 
classified information could be conveyed to the interagency 
in Washington, but we understand discussions are underway.
