¶1.  On January 23, the Government of Sudan sanctioned a 
peaceful demonstration to protest the continuing detention of 
Sudanese nationals at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba (GTMO).  Approximately 100 protesters took part in the 
march, which included a riot police escort.  A smaller group, 
including six men dressed in orange coveralls and black 
hoods, with their hands chained to their waists, approached 
the Embassy's main gate to submit a statement to an Embassy 
representative (PAO).  Fatih Khalil, the president of the 
Sudanese Lawyers Union, the Sudanese Organization Defending 
Homeland and Creed, and the Sudanese Organization Defending 
Iraq and Palestine, orchestrated the protest.  (Note: Khalil, 
a former member of the National Islamic Front (NIF), has led 
several previous protests against the U.S. Embassy.  End 
note.)  The protesters read a statement in both English and 
(at PAO's insistence) in Arabic, and they also handed over a 
list with the names of nine Sudanese detainees at GTMO. 
 
¶2.  The text of the statement is as follows (Note:  copies of 
the statement and list will be faxed to both AF/SPG and 
AF/PD.  End note.): 
 
(Begin text) 
 
If the U.S. Government has evidence that Guantanamo detainees 
have committed crimes, they should be charged and brought to 
fair trial.  If not, they must be released. 
 
(End text) 
 
¶3.  Following a brief question-and-answer session with the 
local print and electronic press, a woman who identified 
herself as the aunt of detainee Sami Muheidine Mohamed Al 
Haj, an Al Jazira cameraman, reminded PAO that her nephew was 
now in his second week of a hunger strike intended to protest 
his detention.  She asked pointedly whether the USG was 
prepared to accept the consequences if something should 
happen to Al Haj's health while in detention.  PAO replied 
that all the protesters' concerns would be forwarded to 
authorities in Washington. 
 
¶4.  The protest is the latest in a series of efforts by the 
Sudanese government and public to draw attention to this 
issue and gain the release of Sudanese detainees at GTMO 
(reftels).  It also reflects growing interest by civil 
society in addressing this issue.
