¶1.  DFA Chief Director for Human Rights and Humanitarian 
Affairs Pitso Montwedi thanked Washington for its response 
(Ref A) to his inquiry (Ref B) regarding the scheduling of 
the next USG-SAG annual human rights consultations.  Montwedi 
understood the USG could not fit the meetings into 2008, and 
he was amenable to holding them in early 2009, e.g. in late 
January after the U.S. inauguration.  The SAG will host, in 
Pretoria.  Montwedi said his team would initiate planning 
meetings with Emboffs in the coming weeks.  In the meantime 
he would check with DFA colleagues to learn of any progress 
on last year's recommendation for South Africa to facilitate 
and advise on USG assistance in troubled spots elsewhere in 
Africa.
