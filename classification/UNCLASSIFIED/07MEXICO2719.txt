VISIT TO MEXICO CITY 
 
REF: STATE 72262 
 
¶1. Post warmly welcomes and grants country clearance to DRL

Mexico City from 28-30 May for trilateral meetings.

¶3.  Your lead expediter is Mr. Luis Flores, cell phone no. 
52 (55) 5437-6697, and will be at the airport to meet you. 
 
¶4.  Hotel confirmation numbers are as follows: 
 
     - Barks-Ruggles, Jordan, and Hill:  326240191 
     - Rohn:  376240191 
 
¶5. The Department of State has designated Mexico City as a 
critical threat post due to the high level of crime and the 
ineffectiveness and corruption of Mexican law enforcement. 
Robberies at gunpoint, pick pocketing, purse snatching, 
taxicab abductions and quick-kidnappings continue to cause us 
concern.  Any hotel selected for you by the embassy will be 
safe, but it is still wise to store all valuables in a room 
safe or in a safe deposit box.  Leaving expensive-looking 
jewelry at home and wearing a plastic watch will 
significantly improve your security profile.  The Embassy 
cautions travelers that they should never hail a cruising 
taxi (or "libre" taxi) but should instead use 
airport-sanctioned taxis, taxis operating from fixed sites 
("sitios), or a cab called for you by your hotel. 
 
¶6.  Mexico does have health concerns.  You should take normal 
tourist precautions with regard to drinking water, eating 
fresh fruits, vegetables and salads.  Some employees react to 
the pollution and high altitude; so take things slowly at 
first.  Travelers to Mexico City may require some time to 
adjust to the altitude (7000 ft.), which can adversely affect 
blood pressure, digestion, sleep, and energy level. 
Individuals with sickle cell trait should consult with the 
appropriate medical unit or their personal physician before 
commencing with travel.  Short-term (TDY) assignments carry 
an added risk because of the lack of time to acclimatize. 
Dehydration, stress, or illnesses compound the basic risks of 
high altitude. 
 
¶7.  We encourage you to access further security and health 
related information as well as post access  regulations for 
the region you are visiting at the Mission Mexico intranet 
homepage at http://mexicocity.state.gov/IntraMissMex.html or
