TIME TO REVIEW WORKPLAN 
 
REF: STATE 198296 
 
¶1. (SBU) Together with Russian First Secretary Dmitri Zykov, 
we delivered reftel agenda and timeline drafts and points to 
Ahmet Muhtar Gun, Head of Department for the MFA's office of 
OSCE, Arms Control and Disarmament on December 15.  Gun told 
us preparations were underway for Turkey's hosting the second 
meeting of Global Initiative partners in Ankara on February 
12-13, 2007.  He said the likely venue for the meeting will 
be the Foreign Ministry.  He promised to provide logistics 
details within a week. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Gun welcomed the drafts for the agenda, timeline, 
and plan of work, and promised comments as soon as possible. 
He noted that he would not be able to reply by the target 
date of December 18, explaining that he will need more time 
to collect feedback from the different GOT agencies and 
departments involved.  Gun recalled the difficulties his 
office encountered in gathering interagency comments prior to 
the Rabat meeting, and told us that he believed that the 
timeline agreed to at Rabat allowed at least two weeks for 
partner countries to respond.  We encouraged Gun to provide 
us with GOT views as soon as possible.
