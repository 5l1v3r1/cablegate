¶1.   THOUGH RAINS CONTINUED TO FALL OVER THE ZAMBEZI RIVER 
BASIN, RAINFALL AMOUNTS EASED SLIGHTLY DURING THE PAST 
SEVEN DAYS AND FLOODING IN THE ZAMBEZI VALLEY SUBSIDED. 
HOWEVER, THE NORTHERN AREAS OF MASHONALAND CENTRAL, WHERE 
LARGE AREAS OF CROPLAND HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, REMAIN AT RISK 
FROM FLOODING FROM THE ZAMBEZI RIVER AND BACK-FLOW FROM THE 
CAHORA BASSA DAM IN MOZAMBIQUE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE 
(GOZ) CIVIL PROTECTION DEPARTMENT (CPD) IS STILL ASSESSING 
DAMAGE IN THE AFFECTED AREAS.  THE FOLLOWING ARE THE 
PROVINCES AND DISTRICTS AFFECTED ACCORDING TO THE CIVIL 
PROTECTION DEPARTMENT (CPD) WEEKLY REPORT OF MARCH 13:

=    MASHONALAND CENTRAL: MUZARABANI DISTRICT: THOUGH 
FLOODING HAS MADE MOST AREAS INACCESSIBLE, ASSESSMENT IS 
STILL GOING ON IN OTHER AREAS AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
AFFECTED HAS RISEN FROM 5700 TO 10,500 FAMILIES. THERE ARE 
3 CASES OF VILLAGERS WHO HAVE DROWNED AND THERE ARE EARLY 
REPORTS OF WIDESPREAD DESTRUCTION OF CROPS. AN IMMEDIATE 
REQUIREMENTS IS FOOD, WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING TRANSPORTED 
BY THE AIR FORCE OF ZIMBABWE.  THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS 
PROVIDE 25,000 WATER TREATMENT TABLETS AND ORGANIZATIONS 
SUCH AS THE RED CROSS, SCF/UK, COMMERCIAL FARMERS UNION, 
FARMERS WORLD, COTTCO AND LOCAL BUSINESSMEN HAVE DONATED 
ADDITIONAL FOOD STUFFS. 
 
=    GURUVE DISTRICT: A TOTAL NUMBER OF 527 HOUSEHOLDS HAVE 
BEEN AFFECTED AND A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE AIRLIFTED 
TO HIGHER GROUND DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE REPORTING 
PERIOD. THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF DISEASE OUTBREAK. 
 
=    MASHONALAND WEST: THERE ARE REPORTS OF ROADS AND 
BRIDGES IN FLOOD.  AT CHAKARI MINE, 4 PEOPLE WERE SWEPT 
AWAY BY A FLOODED STREAM.  AREAS WITH LOW-LYING BRIDGES, 
EARTH AND GRAVEL ROADS ARE IMPASSABLE.  LAKE KARIBA'S WATER 
LEVEL HAS GONE BEYOND ITS SAFETY LEVEL AND TWO FLOODGATES 
REMAIN OPEN RESULTING IN HIGH WATER LEVELS IN THE 
DOWNSTREAM ZAMBEZI RIVER. 
 
=    MIDLANDS PROVINCE: SOME SECONDARY ROADS IN THE GOKWE 
DISTRICT ARE REPORTED IMPASSABLE AND SLIPPERY DUE TO 
INCESSANT RAINS, MAKING SURVEY AND RESCUE TEAM MOVEMENTS 
DIFFICULT.  A LOCAL COMMUNITY SCHOOL WAS CLOSED, BUT HAS 
SINCE REOPENED.

=    MATABELELAND NORTH: TSHOLOTSHO DISTRICT: VILLAGERS 
WHOSE HOMES WERE WASHED AWAY WHEN THE GWAAI RIVER BURST ITS 
BANKS ARE STILL CAMPED AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL.   ISOLATED 
RESCUE OPERATIONS CONTINUE. 
 
¶2.   ASSESSMENT EXERCISES CARRIED OUT SO FAR REVEAL THAT 
ABOUT 30,000 PEOPLE NATIONWIDE NEED SOME LEVEL OF 
ASSISTANCE.  THIS NUMBER INCLUDES ESTIMATES OF AREAS NOT 
YET PHYSICALLY SURVEYED IN MASHONALAND CENTRAL, 
MATABELELAND NORTH AND MIDLANDS.  SOME OF THE PROBLEMS 
BEING FACED BY THE SURVEY AND RESCUE TEAMS IN CARRYING OUT 
ASSESSMENTS ARE IMPASSABLE ROADS AND PROBLEMS OBTAINING 
FUEL FROM EITHER THE OPEN MARKET OR GOVERNMENT FUEL 
LOCATIONS, BOTH OF WHICH ARE DRY.  AS THE FLOODS CONTINUE 
IN MOST AREAS, THERE REMAINS THE FEAR OF AN OUTBREAK OF 
WATER BORNE DISEASES. 
 
¶3.   ASSISTANCE TO FLOOD VICTIMS IS BEING RENDERED BY THE 
GOZ CIVIL PROTECTION DEPARTMENT.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR THEIR WEEKLY STATUS REPORTS AS WELL AS REPORTS FROM 
CPD, AGRITEX, FEWS/SDC AND OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON 
FLOOD CONDITIONS AND RESULTANT DAMAGE IN ZIMBABWE.
