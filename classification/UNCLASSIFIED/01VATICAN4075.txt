ARCHDIOCESE OF FLORENCE TO HAND OVER A RWANDAN PRIEST 
ACCUSED OF GENOCIDE. COMMENTING ON AN EARLIER DECISION BY 
ITALIAN AUTHORITIES NOT TO HAND OVER FATHER ATHANASE SEROMBA 
WHO HAS BEEN WORKING IN A PARISH IN THE ARCHDIOCESE OF 
FLORENCE SINCE 1997, NAVARRO-VALLS OPINED THAT "APPARENTLY" 
THE COURT'S EXTRADITION REQUEST PROVIDED INADEQUATE EVIDENCE 
OF WRONGDOING TO JUSTIFY ARRESTING THE PRIEST. NAVARRO-VALLS 
DID NOT SAY WHETHER THE VATICAN CONSULTED WITH THE ITALIAN 
GOVERNMENT ON THE CASE. (NOTE. IN 1996, POPE JOHN PAUL II 
APPEALED TO RWANDAN CATHOLICS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE 
GENOCIDE "TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO ASSUME THE CONSEQUENCES OF 
THE DEEDS COMMITTED AGAINST GOD AND NEIGHBOR." OTHER VATICAN 
AGENCIES HAVE SAID PREVIOUSLY THAT THE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST 
FATHER SEROMBA SEEMED PART OF A CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH IN RWANDA. END NOTE).

¶4.   VATICAN MISSIONARY NEWS AGENCY "FIDES" ANNOUNCED AUGUST

THEY ARRESTED 18 MONTHS AGO. THE STATEMENT SAID JOSEPH ZHANG 
WEIZHU, "UNOFFICIAL" BISHOP OF XINXIANG IN HENAN, WAS 
ARRESTED WITHOUT CHARGES ON JANUARY 25, 2000 AND RELEASED 
SOMETIME IN JULY. LOCAL CATHOLICS TOLD FIDES THAT BISHOP 
ZHANG WAS RELEASED BECAUSE HE SUFFERS SERIOUS HEALTH 
PROBLEMS.
