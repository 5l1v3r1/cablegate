SUBJECT: SPECIAL ISRAEL MEDIA REACTION 
 
-------------------------------- 
SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT: 
-------------------------------- 
 
U.S. Special Envoy Sen. George Mitchell to Israel, West Bank, 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that sources close to PM Benjamin 
Netanyahu were quick to dismiss reports of growing tensions between 
Israel and the U.S. over the best path for peace with the 
Palestinians.  The sources described NetanyahuQs meeting with U.S. 
Special Envoy George Mitchell as a very positive one in which both 
Israel and the U.S. promised to cooperate fully on regional matters. 
 The Jerusalem Post quoted the sources as saying that Mitchell 
invited Netanyahu to visit Washington on May 11, but that this 
proved problematic for scheduling reasons.  The Jerusalem Post 
reported that, during the conversation, Netanyahu assured Mitchell 
that Israel wanted to move forward to create a sustainable peace 
with the Palestinians, but that this peace had to take into account 
IsraelQs vital security interests. 
 
All media reported that in his talks with senior Israeli officials, 
Mitchell emphasized the necessity of a two-state solution  Maariv 
(Ben Caspit) quoted a senior Israeli diplomatic source as saying 
yesterday that PM Benjamin Netanyahu will eventually grudgingly 
recognize the principle of Qtwo states for two peoples.Q  All media 
reported that in his talks with Mitchell, Netanyahu is trying to 
condition this on Palestinian recognition of a Jewish state.  Maariv 
said that the Americans recognize the premierQs demand and that 
Mitchell used explicit language on the subject in his meeting with 
FM Avigdor Lieberman. 
 
HaQaretz reported in its lead story that the Obama administration is 
preparing a Middle East peace process that will include simultaneous 
bilateral talks between Israel and the Palestinians, and between 
Israel and Syria.  The plan is based on the Arab peace initiative 
that offers establishing normal relations between Israel and Arab 
League states in exchange for withdrawing from the occupied 
territories and establishing a Palestinian state.  According to 
HaQaretz, the U.S. will put together a "security package," including 
demilitarization of the territories from which Israel will withdraw 
and the option of stationing a multinational force in them for 
years.  HaQaretz cited the Obama administrationQs belief that a 
breakthrough in the peace process between Israel and the Arab states 
would restrain Tehran's influence and contribute to the diplomatic 
effort to block Iran's nuclearization.  The regional peace plan will 
be the focus of President Barak Obama's meeting with Jordan's King 
Abdullah in the White House later this month.   HaQaretz reported 
that senior Palestinian Authority officials told Western diplomats 
yesterday that PA President Mahmoud Abbas will be invited to the 
White House after the Jordanian King's visit to discuss the 
Palestinians' participation in the initiative.  Although unconfirmed 
by American sources, Abbas's visit is expected to take place before 
Obama's first meeting with PM Benjamin Netanyahu.  Saudi Arabia's 
King Abdullah is pressing the U.S. administration to adopt the Arab 
initiative, which began as a Saudi initiative.  Maariv noted that 
Mitchell told his Israeli interlocutors that the U.S. is checking 
into the Saudi initiative as a means to fight the Iranian nuclear 
program and Qweaken the Axis of Evil. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that President Shimon Peres told 
Mitchell yesterday that talk of Israel hitting Iran is absurd. 
 
Maariv reported that FM Lieberman embarrassed Mitchell by not 
escorting him out of the Foreign Ministry.  Yediot Aharonot reported 
that Egyptian intelligence chief Omar Suleiman is expected to meet 
with Lieberman in Israel next week. 
 
All media reported that yesterday the Israel Air Force attacked a 
booby-trapped building near the Gaza border fence in response to a 
rocket attack from Gaza the night before.  The IDF has evidence that 
the house had been serving terrorist groups in the Strip for attacks 
and kidnapping efforts directed at IDF border patrols.  The 
structure, which contained hundreds of kilograms of explosives, was 
blown up, the first Israeli attack on Gaza in about three weeks. 
Israel Radio reported that last night a Qassam rocket was launched 
at Israel. 
 
Leading media cited the independent Egyptian daily Al Masr Al-Youm 
as saying that two Palestinian Fatah members accused of belonging to 
the Hizbullah-linked cell uncovered recently in Egypt were planning 
to carry out a major suicide attack in Tel Aviv. 
 
HaQaretz reported that the Israeli defense establishment is 
reconsidering the purchase of F-35 fighter jets due to the 
unexpected high cost and disagreements with the manufacturer 
regarding the installation of Israeli systems in the planes.  "This 
is undoubtedly the ideal fighter plane, and we'd like to have it 
very much, but not at any price," a senior defense establishment 
official was quoted as saying.  HaQaretz reported that a defense 
establishment evaluation concludes that the IAF can maintain its 
operational and technological supremacy even without the advanced 
fighter aircraft.  This could be achieved by upgrading the IAF's 
F-15 and F-16 aircraft and buying more advanced models. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that yesterday DM Ehud Barak met with a 
delegation of U.S. congressmen and urged them to help Israel secure 
funding for the development and production of the Arrow 3 ballistic 
missile defense system.  The daily also cited IsraelQs concern that 
the sale of the large American defense conglomerate Textron to a 
group of businessmen from the UAE will jeopardize deals with Israeli 
defense industries.

U.S. Special Envoy Sen. George Mitchell to Israel, West Bank: 
--------------------------------------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv: QIn order to position itself in front of Iran, a bloc of 
moderate Arab countries must present achievements garnered from 
Israel.  It is Obama who will have to bring those goods.  Netanyahu 
will have to provide them. 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Herb Keinon wrote in the conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post: QIt is likely that Netanyahu  will come 
up with some of his own diplomatic initiatives to take up to 
Washington for his first meeting with Obama sometime in May. 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar'el wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz: QThe Obama administration is 
beginning to look as if it might prefer Iran to the Arab axis. 
 
Intelligence affairs correspondent Yossi Melman wrote in Ha'aretz: 
QIf I were Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's national security 
adviser, I would advise attacking Iran.... In any case, Israel must 
wait in order to not disrupt U.S. President Barack Obama's strategy 
of talking to Iran, a strategy that is destined to fail.... I would 
explain to the Prime Minister than an attack alone, even if it 
succeeds, would not serve Israel's true national interests. 
 
Editor-in-Chief Amnon Lord wrote in the editorial of the 
nationalist, Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe: QPresident Barack Obama 
is playing a dangerous game in the Israeli-Palestinian game. 
 
Block Quotes: 
------------- 
 
Â¶I.  QNo Way but Two States 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Ben Caspit wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv (4/17): QBenjamin Netanyahu will eventually recognize the 
principle of Qtwo states for two peoplesQ -- as if he had any choice 
in the matter.  The problem is that this might not be enough.  As it 
now looks, the Obama administration will not be happy with a 
Qdeclaration of principles,Q or declarations, or intentions, or 
well-covered conferences.  Obama and Hillary Clinton will evaluate 
actions and only actions.... Bibi will have to decide whether to 
join or remain [outside of an international coalition].... Barack 
Obama knows that, in order to handle the Iranian problem, he needs 
international backing.  He will get it only if he comes to the 
Iranians with clean hands, holds true negotiations, and provides 
something else: Israeli goods.  In order to position itself in front 
of Iran, a bloc of moderate Arab countries must present achievements 
garnered from Israel.  It is Obama who will have to bring those 
goods.  Netanyahu will have to provide them. 
 
 
 
 
II.  QRounding Up the Anti-Iranian Posse 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Herb Keinon wrote in the conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post (4/17): QThe expectation in Jerusalem is 
that the new U.S. administration will ask Israel to toe its line. 
In other words, what Obama is saying to Israel is, QI am putting 
together a broad coalition that wants to make peace in the Middle 
East and stop the Iranians.  What is your contribution?Q  And itQs 
clear to a certain degree what the administration wants Israel to 
contribute.... [Israeli] government sources said recently that it is 
likely that Netanyahu, currently going over all elements of IsraelQs 
relationship with the Palestinians, including the status of the 
Roadmap and what was agreed upon in the negotiations between the 
Olmert government and the PA, will come up with some of his own 
diplomatic initiatives to take up to Washington for his first 
meeting with Obama sometime in May. 
 
III.  QAn Ever-Thickening Plot 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar'el wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz (4/17): QIn exposing the 
Hezbollah cell, Egypt wants to focus all responsibility on Iran. 
The timing here is not coincidental.  Now, while the U.S. is 
beginning to openly court Tehran, with President Barack Obama seeing 
it as a potential partner in solving regional problems -- from Iraq 
and Afghanistan, through Lebanon and even Palestine -- the time has 
come to expose Iran's plotting for terrorist activities.... If the 
Bush administration was seen as anti-Arab and anti-Muslim, as an 
administration that divided the Middle East into Qgood Arabs and bad 
Arabs,Q occupied Iraq and Afghanistan, saved Israel from itself, and 
considered Iran to be the central point of the Qaxis of evilQ -- the 
Obama administration is beginning to look as if it might prefer Iran 
to the Arab axis. 
 
IV.  QNeeded: A Formative Historic Event 
 
Intelligence affairs correspondent Yossi Melman wrote in Ha'aretz 
(4/17): QIf I were Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's national 
security adviser, I would advise attacking Iran. In any case, 
Israel must wait in order to not disrupt U.S. President Barack 
Obama's strategy of talking to Iran, a strategy that is destined to 
fail.... If I were the national security adviser, I would explain to 
the Prime Minister than an attack alone, even if it succeeds, would 
not serve Israel's true national interests.  In order to implement a 
strategic breakthrough, the Israeli government will have to 
orchestrate a formative historic event.  It must agree to the 
establishment of a Palestinian state and operate at a feverish pace 
to that end.  In such a case, not only would the United States and 
the pro-Western Sunni Arab world accept the attack on their Shi'ite 
rival, they would even welcome it, thus making it possible to pave 
the way to more peace agreements with Arab nations, security 
arrangements a strategic alliance based on common interests. 
 
Â¶V.   QA Dangerous American Game 
 
Editor-in-Chief Amnon Lord wrote in the editorial of the 
nationalist, Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe (4/17): QPresident Barack 
Obama is playing a dangerous game in the Israeli-Palestinian 
game.... Expectations raised by the Americans that Israel will swear 
to Qtwo states for two peoplesQ might invite flare-ups from the 
Palestinian side.  Alternatively, the well versed Israeli side might 
itself initiate security moves that will take away the initiative 
from the terrorists.
