(U) We delivered ref a and b information to MFA Department 
Head for Nonproliferation and Disarmament Bora Kerimoglu on 
June 3, urging Turkey to send a senior level representative 
(Deputy Secretary or Undersecretary) to the Madrid Meeting, 
and to give a presentation on Turkey's perspective on the 
Global Iniative, with a focus on the imporance of geographic 
diversity, involving current and new partners, and 
multi-agency/multi-sector participation.  Kerimoglu stated 
that Turkey will be represented at the event, but 
deliberations within the MFA are ongoing regarding the level 
of participation, and whether to send a delegation from 
Ankara or have the Turkish embassy in Madrid represent the 
GOT at the event.  He said Turkey will also consider making a 
presentation at the conference.  Kerimoglu anticipated that a 
decision will be reached no later than Friday, June 6, and 
promised to be in touch with the organizers and with the POCs 
listed in ref a once a decision has been made.
