SUBJECT:  ARMENIAN CONTINGENT DEPARTS FOR IRAQ 
 
¶1.  On January 18, a 46-man contingent departed Armenia 
to serve with coalition forces in Iraq.  The Armenian 
troops, consisting mostly of truck drivers, will work 
with Polish forces currently stationed in Iraq.  The 
Armenian media covered the departure in a mostly 
positive light (septel), and the Armenian Defense 
Minister joined the Ambassador in attending the brief 
sendoff.  The Armenian National Assembly authorized the 
deployment December 24.  The Armenians will arrive in 
Iraq following a brief period in Kuwait. 
 
¶2.  During a January 19 meeting with the Ambassador on 
a different issue, Defense Minister Serzh Sargsian said 
that the first reports from the contingent after 
arrival in Kuwait had all been positive.
