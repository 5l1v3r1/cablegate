SUBJECT: WHA - Chavez, Brazilian Leadership and the CALC Summit - 
Sao Paulo Media Reaction - December 19, 2008 
 
Title: Contested Leadership 
 
Lead editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (12-19) says: 
"Reacting to comments made by those [who attended] the Latin America 
and Caribbean Summit (CALC), which gathered 33 countries in the 
State of Bahia (Brazil) attests to the "incontrovertible leadership 
of Brazil"...Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said that Brazil is 
not the only Latin American country to exert "an important 
leadership" in the area.  But neither Chavez nor the observers seem 
to understand the peculiarity of the role played by Brazil in this 
picnic of regional self-assertion, held under anti-American 
rhetoric.  Once more it demonstrates, clearly, that the previously 
mentioned Brazilian leadership is not undisputed.  However, it is 
sufficiently robust to work as moderator in an event that otherwise, 
would be at the mercy of inconsequential Bolivarianism bravado. 
...If MERCOSUL and the Andean Pact, who gather, each one,  handfuls 
of countries; it does not work; what does it say about an entity 
with 33 members that has little in common in addition to the 
situation than being on the same continent."
