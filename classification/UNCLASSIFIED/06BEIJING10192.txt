A/S Hill discusses Bush-Hu summit, Six-Party Talks 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2.  EAP A/S Christopher Hill met with EVFM Yang Jiechi 
and VFM Wu Dawei today in Beijing, MFA Spokesperson 
Liu Jianchao stated during his regular May 25 press 
briefing.  A/S Hill's meeting with Yang focused on 
implementing agreements reached between President Bush 
and Chinese President Hu during Hu's April 2006 visit 
to Washington.  A/S Hill's meeting with VFM Wu lasted 
four hours, including a working lunch and the two 
sides exchanged views on denuclearization of the 
Korean Peninsula. 
 
¶3.  Liu said that A/S Hill and Wu agreed that the 
consensus reached at the Fourth Round of Six-Party 
Talks should be implemented as soon as possible; that 
a peace mechanism for the Peninsula should be 
established and that denuclearization serves the 
interests of all Parties.  China will continue its 
positive efforts to break the impasse, based on 
Beijing's desire to maintain peace, stability and 
development in North East Asia. 
 
¶4.  Beijing rejects foreign comments that China is not 
doing enough to move the Talks forward and is seeking 
only to enhance its self-interest, Liu declared.  The 
PRC hopes the principal Parties concerned will 
cooperate positively with China's efforts. 
 
Response to CMPR: Strengthen Trust, Reject Allegations 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶5.  Asked by UPI for detailed responses to the China 
Military Power Report (CMPR), Liu referred to his May 
24 statement but added that China takes a "responsible 
attitude" toward its military budget and wishes to 
strengthen trust, exchanges and cooperation with other 
countries, including the United States, on military 
budget issues.  Claims that the PRC military budget is 
"non-transparent" are unacceptable, Liu added.  U.S.- 
China relations should be cooperative and 
comprehensive, reflecting broad shared interests on 
bilateral and international issues.  The PRC is not at 
a "strategic crossroads" but follows the path of 
peaceful development, according to Liu.  China does 
not have a "U.S. threat theory" and seeks a 
cooperative and constructive partnership with the 
United States. 
 
¶6.  Pressed by Global Radio News to comment on whom 
China is defending against and to explain its Taiwan 
Strait build-up, Liu stated that China is has a vast 
territory with long borders.  The PRC will maintain 
its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

China-Japan Foreign Ministers' Doha Meeting 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  During Talks in Doha with Japan FM Taro Aso, FM Li 
Zhaoxing emphasized China's position on the Yasukuni 
Shrine, Liu said.  Japanese leaders' visits to the 
shrine are the major obstacle to improved Sino- 
Japanese relations.  The shrine issue is a question of 
importance and cannot be bypassed or sidelined.  Li's 
meeting with Aso reached agreement on removing 
obstacles to the relationship and Aso is an "important 
colleague" in the process of improvement in Sino-Japan 
ties. 
 
Iran 
---- 
 
¶8.  Asked by AFP about reports in Europe 
characterizing China as an obstacle to resolution of 
the Iran nuclear issue, Liu said he had not seen the 
reports but that China would not accept criticism of 
its role.  Beijing upholds the international 
nonproliferation regime and is not pursuing its own 
interests with Iran, Liu stated. 
 
Status of Foreign Visits 
------------------------ 
 
¶9.  East Timor President Gusmao's planned visit to 
Beijing has been postponed due to the situation in 
East Timor.  Ecuador FM Carrion will visit China May 
31-June 6.
