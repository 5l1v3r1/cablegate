SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050115687 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on application 050115687 for the export 
of accelerometers to South Africa.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Sensitivity of commodity and 
unfamiliar foreign intermediate consignee, Advanced Sensors 
Calibration GmbH.  The company has appeared on a previous 
license application but the bona fides of the company have 
not been verified by a Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION PRETORIA: Embassy is requested to make inquiries 
with appropriate host government officials to determine if 
the South African DoD ordered and has received the 
accelerometers and if so, confirm that the articles will be 
used for the purpose stated on the license.  Automated Export 
Data (AES) indicates that items worth $30,243 were shipped 
from the U.S. on 13 September 2008. 
 
¶5. ACTION BERLIN: Department also requests that Embassy make 
appropriate inquiries to verify the bona fides of foreign 
intermediate consignee Advanced Sensors Calibration GmbH, and 
to confirm the legitimacy of this transaction.  PM/DTCC also 
requests that post conducts a site visit to the company in 
order to provide Department with an assessment of its 
business operations and on-site security.  Finally, post is 
asked to assess whether the company appears to be a reliable 
recipient of USML items.  If a site visit is not possible, 
please inform the PM/DTCC officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have supporting documentation for this 
proposed transaction? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--Will Advanced Sensors Calibration GmbH retain positive 
control over the accelerometers at all times? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
END ACTION
