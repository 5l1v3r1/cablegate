POLOFF delivered points reftel points on September 17, 2009, 
to Second Secretary Mohamad Tarawneh of the America's desk 
(note: our usual MFA interlocutors have all already departed 
Amman; in addition to the UNGA delegation and the personnel 
attending the various UN organizational conferences, many MFA 
employees are taking leave in anticipation of the Eid al-Fitr 
Holiday) Tarawneh acknowleged our points and understood our 
reasoning on the issue of a working-level versus 
ministerial-level meeting in New York and acknowledged the 
importance of the AHLC building momentum after a resumption 
of negotiations between Israel and the PA. Tarawneh 
questioned us on the views of other AHLC members on this 
issue, but could not provide a definitive answer on the GOJ's 
concurrence with our objectives for the September 22 meeting. 
We wil continue to follow up on the matter with the MFA and 
advise of any further developments.
