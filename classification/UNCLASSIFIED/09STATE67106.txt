¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-license/pre-shipment check on license 050171972 for 
the export of aviation equipment to the Czech Republic.  Post 
is requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 
days. Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect

on several licenses in the past.

BHV Aviation playing in this transaction?  Is BHV Aviation

transaction? 
 
(To Glomex MS)

are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
--What is your relationship with Transaero in the United 
States?  What are the terms of the agreement between your

commissions for its services in this transaction?

articles?  If so, please describe your inventory and security

of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
(To GOCR Export/Import Authorities) 
 
--Is Glomex MS properly authorized to broker, import, and/or 
sell defense articles in the Czech Republic? 
 
--Do you have any information on Glomex MS that would 
question their reliability as a recipient or broker of U.S. 
defense articles? 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
