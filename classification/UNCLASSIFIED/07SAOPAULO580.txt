Â¶1. "Chavez' New Constitution" 
 
Main editorial in center right O Estado de S. Paulo (7/2) says: "The 
first measure Hugo Chavez took once he became president of Venezuela 
in 1998 was to reform the constitution.... With the 1999 
constitution Hugo Chavez was able to begin to tailor Venezuela to 
the "bolivarian" format....Now [Chavez says] the 1999 constitution 
has "residues of the old order"...and therefore it is time to write 
a new one that reflects the goals of the dictator. The text is 
almost ready.... From what is known about the project...private 
property will be tolerated according to the convenience of the 
dictator of the moment. Economy will be continuously 
socialized...the central bank will lose its autonomy...indefinite 
reelection of the president will be allowed.... Chavez also intends 
to formalize the Bolivarian militias and the community police's role 
as a national defense force. The Armed forces will perform 
"strategic functions" to defend the country from an invasion of U.S. 
troops-a fantasy threat used by the dictator to mobilize part of the 
population.... The Bolivarian militias are actually a group of 
brutes ...the community police...is a copycat of the Committees for 
the Defense of the Revolution which Fidel Castro uses to keep the 
population in line, It will be no different in Venezuela."
