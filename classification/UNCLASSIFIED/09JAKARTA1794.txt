SUBJECT: CLIMATE CHANGE PARTNERSHIP FOR POTUS BILAT AT APEC 
 
¶1. (SBU) Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director General Retno Marsudi 
agreed that the planned bilateral meeting between President Obama 
and President Yuhoyono at APEC in Singapore presents an opportunity 
to advance our bilateral relationship.  Citing President Yudhoyono's 
brave unilateral declaration at the Pittsburg G-20 that Indonesia 
can reduce its emissions by 26% on its own or by 41% with 
international assistance, the DCM stated that the U.S. wants to 
support Yudhoyono's constructive move.  He suggested that climate 
take a prominent place on the agenda of the bilateral meeting and 
discussed possible elements currently under consideration by the USG 
that could be included in a public announcement of a new 
U.S.-Indonesia Climate Partnership.  The potential items included a 
second debt-for-nature swap arrangement, a climate center on peat 
and forests, USAID Jakarta's mitigation and adaptation programs, and 
EPA's clean air program with the Jakarta Government. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Marsudi welcomed the U.S. intention to partner with 
Indonesia on climate change.  She sees this as an early harvest of 
the Comprehensive Partnership to be formally launched when President 
Obama visits Indonesia.  She and her staff expressed frustration 
that Indonesia's peat lands thus far have not been included in the 
UN's REDD framework.  The DCM suggested that both sides consider how 
the announcement coming out of the two presidents' bilateral meeting 
could advance the inclusion of peat lands for carbon accounting. 
Marsudi also expressed interest in green technology transfer and 
asked for more details on the climate center idea. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Earlier in the conversation during ESTHoff's briefing on 
U.S. Climate Policy, Marsudi expressed concern that U.S. negotiation 
credibility and persuasiveness at Copenhagen would be undermined if 
U.S. climate legislation currently pending in the Senate is not 
completed in time for Copenhagen.  She reiterated President 
Yudhoyono's position that failure on a global climate solution is 
not an option and that every nation must take action.  U.S. 
bilateral engagement with Indonesia, she cautioned, cannot become or 
be seen as a substitute for full U.S. commitment to the multilateral 
process.  In closing, Marsudi noted that her new Minister has 
prioritized climate change, and she looks forward to meeting again 
in the coming days to continue planning the bilateral meeting.
