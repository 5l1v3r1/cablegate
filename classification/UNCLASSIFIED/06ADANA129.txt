ambulance for carrying the coffin of a PKK terrorist, who was 
killed in March 2005 in Mardin's Derik district.  Baydemir, who 
will face up to one year in prison, said that it was a humane 
duty extended. If we are requested to do so again, we will 
comply, said Baydemir. 
 
YENI SAFAK:     The daily reported that the application of Mayor

counterpart in resolving the Kurdish issue."  Bakirhan and his 
colleagues face one to 3 years in prison and loss of political 
rights.  Separately, an investigation has begun against Hakkari
