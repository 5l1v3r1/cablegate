Atmospherics: 
------------- 
 
Several local issues preoccupied the press,particularly what was 
described as the "first collision" over the next parliamentary 
electionsduring the Council of Ministers meeting .  Local issues, 
however, did not eclipse the "shoe-throwing" incident in Iraq. All 
newspapers highlighted the incident with many noting that "President 
Bush got what he deserved."

"American Consensus over Lebanon!" an editorial by Sateh Noureddine 
in Arab nationalist As-Safir (12/15): 
 
"Among all the speeches that were delivered on U.S.-Lebanese 
relations...the speech that was delivered by the advisor of the new 
Secretary of State, Martin Indyk, during the Lebanese-American 
conference that ...was held last Friday was the most important and 
the most accurate.  Also, it was probably the closest to the 
position that the new American Administration will take on Lebanon. 
In all previous speeches...there were two contradictory 
expectations: the first expects the Obama Administration to keep 
Lebanon on its priority list...the second expects the Obama 
Administration to make a deal at Lebanon's expense.  Ambassador 
Indyk, however, confirmed publicly and frankly that Lebanon is not 
important strategically for the United States  ...He described the 
U.S. commitment to Lebanon following the Hariri assassination as 
'ethical,' but (this commitment) does not remove fears of Lebanon 
turning into a failed state if the Lebanese do not take their 
destiny into their own hands, or allow Hizballah to dominate the 
country as a result of the next elections.  ...Indyk...also seemed 
to say clearly that if Lebanon does negotiate with Israel, it will 
become the sacrifice...Such a clear American threat confirms that 
Lebanon has no value in U.S. eyes unless it becomes involved in 
negotiations with Israel and reaches a peace treaty with it.  ...Let 
us hope that all will realize that the dangers of not negotiating 
with Israel are much less than sitting with an Israeli negotiator, 
even if a Syrian negotiator attends." 
 
"Lebanese Comics and Arab Miracles...!" an editorial by Talal Salman 
in Arab nationalist As-Safir (12/15): 
 
"...As for Iraq in which we witnessed a suitable farewell for the 
head of the American Administration that took a decision to occupy 
Iraq, ...the Iraqi journalist stopped President Bush from 
celebrating his victory.  Bush's picture showing him ducking to 
avoid the shoe will be the best briefing for his term and his great 
achievements!  This Iraqi journalist summarized the Iraqi people's 
position on the U.S. occupation.  The Americans will stop for a very 
long time before this eternal picture which indicated the Iraqi's 
opinion of this security pact between their country and[Kz'z...There is 
nothing better than this Iraqi shoe for describing the 
Iraqi people's opinion of Bush's policies..."
