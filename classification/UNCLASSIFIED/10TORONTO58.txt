¶1. (U) On January 21, Ontario announced a landmark C$7 billion deal 
to develop 2,500 megawatts (MW) of wind (2,000 MW) and solar (500 
MW) power projects at highly-subsidized rates.  The winner of the 
award is a Korean consortium led by Samsung Corporation and the 
Korean Electric Power Corporation.  The Province's announcement 
confirms speculation that Samsung would establish manufacturing 
facilities in the Province in order to qualify for the lucrative 
feed-in tariffs associated with the province's Green Energy Act 
(reftel).  The consortium will reportedly manufacture equipment 
such as wind turbine towers and solar inverters in Ontario. 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) Negotiations for the deal, shrouded in controversy, 
apparently began long before the domestic content requirements for 
feed-in tariff eligibility were finalized and released to the 
public in late September 2009.  Details revealed in today's 
announcement, coming nearly four months after the deal was first 
leaked, does not differ markedly from the initial reports.
