REF: STATE 100153 
 
On September 30, Charge delivered reftel points jointly with the UK 
Charge and French DCM to Anneli Vares, the MFA Middle East desk 
officer, and to Kristi Torim, of the MFA's Arms Control Bureau. 
Vares said that Estonia fully supports our position, is very 
concerned by the new site and by recent missile tests, and believes 
Iran must open the new site to IAEA inspection.  If no diplomatic 
solution is forthcoming in the P5+1 talks, Vares said Estonia would 
support further sanctions.  The GOE would prefer if sanctions were 
approved by the UNSC, but understands this may not be possible.
