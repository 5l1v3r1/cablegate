SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION REPORT - P5 + 1 Meeting in Paris 
Middle East 
PARIS - Thursday, July 13, 2006 
 
 
(A) SUBJECTS COVERED IN TODAY'S REPORT: 
 
P5 + 1 Meeting in Paris 
Middle East 
 
(B) SUMMARY OF COVERAGE: 
 
The participants in the discussions concerning Iran are "speaking at 
cross purposes" according to left-of-center Le Monde. The daily says 
that Javier Solana's entourage expressed frustration and 
disappointment following the meeting between the EU Foreign Minister 
and the Iranian negotiator in Brussels. 
 
In right-of-center Le Figaro, the report notes that the West is 
"already extremely concerned by the Iranian issue and this concern 
is compounded by the North Korean missile tests." Le Figaro 
announces that "Tensions are mounting with the threat of sanctions 
on Teheran," noting that yesterday's meeting of the UN Security 
Council and Germany "opened the path towards economic and diplomatic 
sanctions." The paper also noted that faced with Iran's 
procrastination, Russia and China - who formerly took a more 
'conciliatory' tone towards Tehran-have signed on to the harder line 
advocated by the Americans and Europeans. The paper highlights the 
fact that the meeting's participants were united in their "profound 
disappointment" over Iran's failure to accept the offer of an 
incentives package, but that they had also agreed to "give Iran a 
way out" by offering to forego sanctions and return to the 
negotiating table should Iran comply with the regulations. (See Part 
C) 
 
Le Figaro's front page (headline: "Brutal Escalation in the Middle 
East") reports that the kidnapping of the two Israeli soldiers has 
been condemned by the White House, the Elysee and the Kremlin. An 
inside report notes that Hamas wants to negotiate with Israel. The 
editorial by Pierre Rousselin warns of the "Spiral of Crises." 
Catholic La Croix's headline: "Israel Opens A New Front" and 
editorial underscore the relative indifference of the international 
community with regard to the situation in the Middle East until now. 
(See Part C) 
 
Popular right-of-center Le Parisien carries an interview of Pascal 
Boniface, Director of IRIS (the French Institute for Strategic and 
International Relations). Boniface remarks that the "military and 
geographic spread of the conflict" in the Middle East is what is the 
most alarming aspect of the current situation. Boniface highlights 
that "the international community's apathy has provoked frustration 
and anger in Arab public opinion... and Hezbollah has seized on the 
opportunity to appear as the last bastion against Israel... 
Hezbollah is united in its cause with Hamas." Finally Boniface notes 
that because of the situation in Iraq and the danger emanating from 
Iran, an Israeli limitary intervention in Lebanon would open a 
Pandora's box... France, for its part appears to be completely 
withdrawn. It is common for Europe to show discretion with regard to 
the Middle East, but not France." 
 
Left-of-center Liberation reports that the North Korean missile test 
issue has "deeply divided" the UN and its neighbors. "Christopher 
Hill's initial optimism... was short lived... And Kim Jong Il is no 
doubt savoring the absence of consensus. Especially given that the 
U.S.'s strongest allies in the region: South Korea and Japan, have 
adopted positions that are diametrically opposed." 
 
Left-of-center Le Monde reports that before the G8 "George Bush is 
"sealing the reunion between Washington and Germany." For Liberation 
President Bush is "Flaunting his Love Affair With Merkel." 
Liberation says that "aside from an affection, that appears sincere, 
on the part of the American President for the German Chancellor, he 
really does not have a choice. Within 'Old Europe' Blair and Chirac 
are nearing the end of their terms in office and are politically 
weakened. By comparison, Angela Merkel is at the head of the leading 
European economic power. From Washington's point of view, Germany is 
an essential player especially as it will soon take on the 
presidency of the EU and the G8, in swaying Russia and China to 
agree to sanctions against Iran and North Korea." 
In an op-ed in right-of-center economic Les Echos, French President 
Chirac outlines France's view on the G8 Summit. "I will attend the 
G8 Summit... with four objectives in mind: mobilize anew the 
developed and developing countries to address the issues of climate 
change, poverty and disease; to help Africa at a time when it is 
beginning to emerge; to put an end to terrorism and the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction - especially with 
regard to Iran and North Korea. I am convinced that we can use 
globalization and international growth as a chance to change the 
course of humanity while repairing unacceptable social and 
ecological excesses... Energy should not become a political tool... 
We must work together to promote renewable and alternative fuel, 
including nuclear energy... To global threats, we need to be able to 
have a global response... We will get nowhere in the fight against 
global warming by relying on unilateral or partial declarations... 
The seven countries of the G8 that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol 
have a singular responsibility. They must set the example by 
upholding their commitments... They must show the way forward for 
after 2012. We need an ambitious accord... that will involve all of 
the countries, including the United States and the developing 
nations." 
 
(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
P5 + 1 Meeting in Paris 
 
"Imminent Sanctions" 
Regional Ouest France's editorial by Joseph Limagne (07/13): "The 
time to choose between negotiations and sanctions appears imminent. 
Americans, Europeans, Russians and Chinese decided in Paris 
yesterday to bring the Iranian issue before the UNSC. With the 
kidnapping of two Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah and Tsahal's riposte 
in Lebanon the situation in the Middle East has reached a critical 
point. The danger that violence will erupt in the region increases 
with Damascus' and Teheran's support for the Lebanese Shiites and 
Hamas' Islamist Palestinians.... In India the two attacks have 
bloodied Bombay, like last year in London or the year before in 
Madrid. Whatever the origins are, terrorism remains the principal 
blight of our time." 
 
Middle East 
 
"Failed Withdrawal" 
Guillaume Goubert in Catholic La Croix (07/13): "There was a time, 
not so long ago when one could still talk about a peace process in 
the Middle East... but since then this process has been going 
backward and one wonders if we will not have to rename it "war 
process" soon... It has been six years since Israel was compelled to 
carry out operations in neighboring states. The conflict was 
limited, so to speak, to the confrontation with the Palestinians. 
The addition of Hezbollah to the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, 
could have possible implications for Israel's relations with at 
least three states: Lebanon, but also Syria and Iran by more 
indirect political and religious channels... One hopes for an 
effective mobilization of diplomatic efforts... because the 
conflict, up until now, appears to leave the international community 
remarkably indifferent." 
"Stakes" 
The editorial by Gerard Dupuy in left-of-center Liberation (07/13): 
"By cautioning against an 'acceleration of the spiral of violence' 
the head of the Palestinian Authority may not have shone by virtue 
of his talents as a poet but he aptly summed up the impression that 
anything, even the very worst, could happen in the Middle East 
now... At what point does an act of war become a war outright?... As 
always in the Middle East, what goes on front stage is determined by 
what is being decided in the shadows backstage. In this case 
Hezbollah and Hamas are under foreign influence from Damascus and 
Teheran... Two key areas that Israel could not think of attacking... 
without the help of its American ally which, until further notice, 
is not inclined to give the green light." 
 
"The Spiral of Crises" 
Pierre Rousselin in right-of-center Le Figaro notes (07/13): "If the 
Middle East has become more dangerous than ever it is because there 
are several crises going on there at once and that each of these 
crises - the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran - are 
escalating in the level of violence... The destabilization of 
Lebanon could serve the interests of Syria and Iran, Damascus' 
principal concern being to divert international attention away from 
the UN investigation into the assassination of former Prime Minister 
Rafic Hariri... Teheran for its part continues to reject the 
generous offer made by the great powers." 
 
"Military Might Does Not Guarantee Security" 
Dominique Garraud writes in the editorial in regional daily La 
Charente Libre (07/13): "The temptation is strong for Israel now to 
show once again its military supremacy, no matter the cost to Arab 
and Israeli civilians. The obligation of Israel's allies, starting 
with the U.S., is to urge it to show restraint and to remind it that 
none of its previous military victories have contributed anything to 
ensuring its security... to the contrary." 
 
"The Fuse is Lit" 
For Jean-Claude Kiefer in regional Les Dernieres Nouvelles d'Alsace 
(07/13): "The international environment has changed. Teheran, with 
Damascus in its wake, is now openly defying the U.S. that is bogged 
down in Iraq. Iranian aid to Palestinian activists via Syria and 
Lebanon has taken on unprecedented proportions and the calls by the 
Iranian president for the destruction of Israel enflames the 
extremists. The fuse is lit and the fire could soon spread to 
Lebanon."
