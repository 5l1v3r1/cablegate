SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050076491 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050076491 for the export of 
rifles and ammunition to Germany. Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days. Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: End-user, Helmut Hofmann, is a major 
recipient of U.S. Munitions Listed (USML) ammunition and 
firearms for commercial resale in Germany. The company 
received well over $8 million in USML items in 2008. The 
company continues to seek large additional export 
authorizations despite that the fact that many authorizations 
for last year have not yet been exhausted. This request is to 
verify the receipt of the USML listed below and to confirm 
that it is sold within the German commercial market only. 
This inquiry also seeks information on the annual sales of 
Helmut Hofmann. 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to make appropriate 
inquires to representatives of end-user, Helmut Hofmann, to 
verify receipt of the USML listed below and confirm that it 
is for commercial resale in Germany only.  The following 
points are included for guidance: 
 
(To Helmut Hofmann) 
 
--Can you confirm that the ammunition and firearms listed 
below were purchased for commercial resale in Germany only? 
Who are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
--What quantities of the items authorized on this license did 
Helmut Hofmann actually receive thus far? 
 
--What are your annual sales of U.S.-origin firearms and 
ammunition? What quantity of firearms and ammunition did your 
company seek to import from the United States in 2008? Can 
you explain the discrepancy, if any, between that which was 
authorized for export from the United States and that which 
the company actually sold in 2008? 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
