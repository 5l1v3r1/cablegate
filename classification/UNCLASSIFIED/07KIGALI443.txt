SUBJECT: KIGALI SCIENCE FELLOW REQUEST 
 
REF: STATE 30914 
 
¶1. In response to reftel and previous communication between 
Assistant Secretary Claudia McMurray and Minister Romain Murenzi, 
the following details four possible workplans for a Science Fellow. 
 
¶2. In Rwanda, the Science Fellow would work in Minister Murenzi's 
Office, in the Office of the Presidency.  Post point of contact is 
Economic Officer Daniel Stoian, stoiandm@state.gov, 250-505-601 
x3266. 
 
¶3. BIO-FUELS: Rwanda's energy costs are the highest in the region 
and the unreliability of electricity continues to be one of the 
major development challenges.  Exploitation of methane gas for 
energy has begun, but has been stalled by a lack of expertise, 
regulatory framework, and overall strategic plan.  A Science Fellow 
would be able to guide the GOR through the technical aspects, 
economic aspects, policy issues, necessary regulatory framework, 
environmental impact analysis, and financing. 
 
¶4. GEO-SCIENCES:  Geothermal is rumored to hold commercial, albeit 
unexploited, potential in Rwanda.  A Science Fellow would be able to 
assist the GOR in developing geologic field investigations, 
geophysical exploratory techniques, and activities that need to be 
funded and launched to enable the GOR to analyze and evaluate its 
geothermal energy reserve base potential.  A Science Fellow would 
also be able to guide the GOR through the technical aspects, 
economic aspects, policy issues, regulatory framework, compliance 
with environmental regulatory platform, and financing. 
 
¶5. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY PLATFORM:  Several governmental and 
donor organizations are working on regulations and legislation, and 
a Science Fellow would be able to coordinate the disparate efforts 
in a harmonized fashion.  Assistance on code development, code 
implementation, and code enforcement is needed and would go a long 
way in ensuring that an environment is created that is both 
protective of business interests and environmental concerns.  A 
Science Fellow would assist the GOR to set up their regulatory 
administrative bodies and to provide the needed training and 
sensitization. 
 
¶6. WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT & MANAGEMENT: As a predominantly 
agrarian society, Rwanda needs to properly develop, protect, and 
manage its water resources.  An Embassy Science Fellow would be able 
to provide technical assistance to the GOR in developing a robust 
water resources program that will enable the government to focus on 
building capacity to better develop, manage, and plan for its 
population and its agrarian and industrial water supply needs.
