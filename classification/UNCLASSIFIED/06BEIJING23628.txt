Six-Party Talks 
--------------- 
 
¶2. China hopes to resume Six-Party Talks as soon as possible, 
MFA Spokesperson Jiang Yu said at the regular scheduled 
November 7 press briefing.  Following China's positive 
efforts, the delegations of the United States, China and the 
DPRK met recently in Beijing and agreed to resume the 
Six-Party Talks as soon as possible. 
 
¶3.  Responding to questions from reporters about the 
possibility of informal five-party talks, Jiang said the 
quick resumption of the Talks can relax the situation made 
more complicated by the DPRK nuclear test in October. 
Beijing hopes that the actions of all parties can create a 
positive atmosphere for the Six-Party Talks, when asked 
whether Japan should withdraw from the Talks. 
 
U/S Burns and U/S Joseph Visit 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4. United States' Undersecretary Nick Burns and Vice Foreign 
Minister Yang Jiechi will co-chair the Third U.S.-China 
Strategic Dialogue, Jiang announced.  U/S Burns will also 
meet respectively with FM Li Zhaoxing and Senior Vice Foreign 
Minister Dai Bingguo on November 8.  A consensus in the 
strategic dialogue is conducive to the bilateral relationship 
and to peace and stability of the international community. 
More information on U/S Robert Joseph's visit will be 
forthcoming after the November 8 meetings, Jiang announced. 
 
Egypt and China-African Relations 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶5. President Mubarak is following up his participation in the 
China-African Cooperation Summit with a state visit to 
Beijing, Jiang announced.  China and Egypt are both signatory 
parties to an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy 
and China will honor this relationship in cooperating with 
Egypt to develop nuclear energy in the civilian sector, Jiang 
added. 
 
¶6.  The China-Africa strategic partnership is no different 
from China's other partnerships, Jiang said.  Beijing's 
partnerships adhere to the principles of peace, equality and 
the mutual development of the parties.  China and the African 
nations are developing countries and their mutual development 
is beneficial to the peace and stability of the international 
community. 
 
Russia-China Pipeline 
--------------------- 
 
¶7.  Energy cooperation is an important part of the strategic 
relationship between China and Russia, Jiang answered when 
asked by a Kazakh news reporter about Sino-Russian oil 
pipeline cooperation.  Russia and China have reached a 
consensus to work together on the construction of an oil 
pipeline that will be conducive to the common development of 
both nations, she added.

the Iraqi people, Jiang said when asked to comment on the 
sentencing of Saddam Hussein.  China hopes that all Iraqi 
people can enjoy peaceful lives as soon as possible, she 
stated. 
 
Kyrgyzstan Reforms 
------------------ 
 
¶9.  China has taken note of the opposition party 
demonstrations in Kyrgyzstan, Jiang said when asked to 
comment by a reporter.  Kyrgyzstan is a friendly neighbor and 
fellow member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). 
 China believes that the Kyrgyz people have the ability to 
resolve this issue within the legal framework.  Beijing hopes 
the international community can play a constructive role in 
helping Kyrgyzstan to maintain its internal stability, Jiang 
said. 
 
China-Vietnam Relations 
-----------------------
