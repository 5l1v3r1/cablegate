SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action message.  Please see para 6. 
 
¶2. (U) On September 2 at 2:55 p.m. local time, a 7.0 
magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of western Java, 
Indonesia, approximately 95 km south-southwest of the 
nearest heavily populated city, Bandung, and approximately 
195 miles south-southeast of Jakarta.  Two aftershocks 
measuring 5.1 and 5.4 on the Richter scale, respectively, 
occurred within two hours of the first temblor.  Initial 
damage assessments indicated little significant damage in 
Jakarta and Bandung cities, but more significant damage in 
Tasikmalaya and Garut districts along the Java coastline. 
Local tsunami warnings were issued for coastal areas within 
several hundred kilometers of the epicenter but were 
withdrawn approximately one hour later. 
 
¶3. (U) According to international media reports, government 
officials had reported at least 42 deaths and 300 injuries 
resulting from the earthquake as of the morning of 
September 3.  In addition, according to the GOI Disaster 
Management National Agency (BNPB), more than 40 individuals 
are missing and presumed dead following an associated 
landslide in the district of Cianjur, approximately 100 km 
south of Jakarta.   BNPB officials note that the death toll 
could rise significantly higher, as communications with 
coastal areas are currently limited.  In addition, 
government officials report that the earthquake damaged 
approximately 1,300 homes. 
 
¶4.  (U) In Garut, affected sub-districts include Cikaret, 
Cibalong, Singajaya, Cilawung, Pancatura, Banjarwangi, and 
Paameungpeuk, with an estimated 40 percent of houses 
heavily damaged in some of the most-affected sub-districts, 
according to the UN Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).  In Tasikmalaya, the most- 
affected area is Cipatujah Sub-District, with local 
officials reporting that an estimated 70 percent of homes 
and other buildings had collapsed in Ciharas village in 
Cipatujah.  According to OCHA, damage in Tasikmalaya City 
remained limited.

USG RESPONSE 
------------ 
 
¶5.  (U) The Chief of Mission has determined that the 
September 2 earthquake off the coast of western Java, 
Indonesia, caused damage beyond the immediate capability of 
the host government to respond, that the host government is 
willing to accept international assistance, that the 
disaster is of sufficient magnitude to warrant U.S. 
Government assistance, and that it is in the best interest 
of the U.S. Government to respond. The Chief of Mission is 
therefore exercising the disaster assistance authority. 
 
¶6.  (U) Post requests that USAID/OFDA release USD 100,000 
for the immediate relief and early recovery through a non- 
governmental organization.  In addition, Post welcomes the 
visit of USAID/OFDA Principal Regional Advisor Al Dwyer 
from Bangkok to work with MDRO Alfred Nakatsuma and other 
Mission staff to assess the situation and determine if 
additional assistance is required.
