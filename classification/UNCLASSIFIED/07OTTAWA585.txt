SUBJECT: CANADA ANNOUNCES NEW HEALTH FUNDING FOR HAITI 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  International Cooperation Minister Josee 
Verner recently announced that the Canadian International 
Development Agency (CIDA) will commit over C$45 million for 
new health-related development projects in Haiti: C$18.75 
million to support the development of Haiti's health system; 
C$17.5 million to support immunizations; and C$9.2 million in 
response to the United Nations Transitional Appeal.  Verner 
also indicated that Canada would provide another C$20 million 
for a financial insurance mechanism in the Caribbean in the 
event of natural disasters.  The announcement received praise 
from GOH Minister of Planning and Foreign Cooperation 
Bellerive.  The funding is part of the C$520 million 
commitment Canada made at last July's Port-au-Prince 
conference to support the Haitian government's development 
efforts.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) During her official visit to Haiti in late February, 
International Development Minister Verner announced several 
GoC initiatives to facilitate access to health services to 
vulnerable segments of the Haitian people, including women, 
and to offer basic services in health, prevention and 
protection of human rights.  The money is earmarked for three 
major projects. 
 
¶3. (U) C$18.75 million will go, over five years, to the 
Health System Development Support Project (PADESS) to 
contribute to the development of Haiti's health system, 
especially in the departments of Artibonite, Nippes, the 
Southeast and Northeast.  PADESS is to strengthen Haiti's 
Ministry of Public Health and Population's regulatory role 
and will develop a vision shared by health sector 
participants, including the GoH, the private sector, 
religious communities, and Haitian and international 
voluntary organizations.  The project includes C$5 million to 
support initiatives of Canadian partners to deliver basic 
health services. 
 
¶4. (U) C$17.5 million, over five years, has been allocated to 
Haiti's Expanded Vaccination Support Program (PAPEV) to 
reduce infant morality.  PAPEV is sub-divided into three 
components: 
 
-- C$15 million to support a Pan American Health Organization 
(PAHO) and the United Nations International Children's 
Emergency Fund (UNICEF) program to build capacity and 
coordinate the work of the organizations giving the 
vaccinations; 
-- C$1 million to the International Development Research 
Center (IDRC) for research to improve the health system's 
delivery of immunization programs; 
-- C$1.5 million to support an initiative involving Haiti, 
Brazil, and Canada to strengthen the Ministry of Public 
Health and Population's Expanded Vaccination Program and 
improve the delivery of vaccines through a refrigerated 
distribution chain. 
 
¶5. (U) C$9.2 million will go to the United Nations Appeal to 
Support Haiti's Stabilization to promote equality between men 
and women and social peace in Haiti.  The money will be spent 
on six initiatives: 
 
-- C$5 million for PAHO for free obstetrical care for poor 
pregnant women; 
-- C$520,000 to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) 
for human rights protection for people living in vulnerable 
situations; 
-- C$1.2 million to the UNFPA to support women and girls who 
are victims of sexual violence; 
-- C$920,000 to the United Nations Food and Agriculture 
Organization for horticulture projects in the urban areas of 
Port-au-Prince and Jeremie; 
-- C$1.4 million to the United Nations Development Program 
(UNDR) to support human development in the Haiti-Dominican 
Q(UNDR) to support human development in the Haiti-Dominican 
Republic frontier zone; 
-- C$125,000 to the UNDP for coordinating humanitarian and 
relief efforts and C$50,000 to monitor results. 
 
¶6. (U) Minister Verner also announced that Canada is donating 
C$20 million to a World Bank initiative to establish the 
Catastrophic Risk Management Facility (CCRIF) in the 
Caribbean region which will enable CARICOM governments to 
purchase coverage similar to business interruption insurance 
to provide immediate cash payments after a major earthquake 
or hurricane.  This facility will be particularly useful to 
finance the immediate post disaster recovery and give 
governments time to mobilize additional resources for 
longer-term reconstruction.
