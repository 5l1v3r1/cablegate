SUBJECT: Chavez- The Oligarch - Sao Paulo Media Reaction 
 
Title- Chavez, the Oligarch 
 
Lead editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (November 23) 
says: "...In any country governed for almost ten years by a 
president with a 62% popularity rating, the conquest, by the 
opposition, of some rich and populous States would be a setback for 
him - in Chavez's case, this would be a disaster.  First of all, 
because this would destroy forever the image of unbeatable chief at 
the ballot box... and secondly, but no less important, because it is 
from the control of the states that Hugo Chavez intends to 
resuscitate the Bolivarian constitution - which transformed 
Venezuela into a socialist country, without capitalism and private 
initiative, in addition to allow indefinite re-election -, which was 
repudiated by the voters.  The Bolivarian dictatorship of Chavez is 
no different from typical Latin American military dictatorships. 
Established to repair deteriorated political practices, to put the 
richness of the country at the people's service and modernize 
institutions and the national economy, in a very short period of 
time it has transformed itself into all that it promised to 
combat."
