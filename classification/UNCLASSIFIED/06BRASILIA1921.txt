¶1.  Several demarches have been made. DCM Chicola telephoned the 
Foreign Ministry official with responsibility for all UN-related 
events and urged that FonMin Amorim participate in the September 22 
press conference being hosted by the Secretary.  He also called the 
FonMin Chief of Staff, Maria Nazareth Farani Azevedo, and made the 
same request.  This conversation was later followed-up by PolCoun 
who discussed the September 22 event when making a call to Farani on 
a different issue. ESTH Counselor delivered the demarche to the A/S 
equivalent for environmental issues. 
 
¶2.  In all these cases, the responses were similar: the GoB is aware 
of the event and is considering how to respond.  It has not yet made 
a decision on whether or not to join CAWT.  We were promised, 
however, by both Farani and Velloso that a response would be 
forthcoming no later than Monday, September 18. 
 
¶3.  We will continue to follow up with the Brazilians on the issue 
and will report regularly.
