¶1. In a meeting November 12, concerning the designation of 
the Export Development Bank of Iran (EDBI) and its affiliates 
under E.O. 13382, the Director of the Department of 
Multilateral Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
International Cooperation Mmamosadinyana Punkie Josephine 
Molefe stated to PolOff that she would ensure this 
information was forwarded to all interested parties.  The 
Director stated that there will be a GOB multi-agency 
counterterrorism meeting on Friday and she will take this 
information with her to the meeting. 
 
¶2. Director Molefe said that Botswana will respect the 
designation of the Export Development Bank of Iran (EDBI) and 
its affiliates under E.O. 13382. She also stressed that 
Botswana considers its obligations under international 
agreements very important.  In fact, she stated that Botswana 
is currently working on a large-scale computer database to 
assist with these obligations.  In the computer program 
individual agencies could look up what responsibilities they 
have for each of the international agreements to help ensure 
compliance with their obligations.  The Director was hopeful 
that the project would be up and running in the next eight 
months.
