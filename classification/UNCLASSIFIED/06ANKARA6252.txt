REF: A. A) STATE 140478 
     ¶B. B) ANKARA 00502 
 
¶1.  Per ref a request, we met with Mechanical and Chemical 
Industries Corporation (MKEK) Director of Marketing and 
Export Akif Akgul  on September 29, 2006 to discuss license 
number 05-01007495 per reftel A and confirmed the order and 
the end users.  Akgul was forthcoming about the contract and 
confirmed that MKEK had ordered 90 of the Remington Model 700 
bolt-action centerfire rifles (including scopes).  Akgul 
stated that the U.S. seller (Raci Holding Inc.) was willing 
to fulfill the order for the original 40 rifles as noted in 
reftel A, and that MKEK wished to order an additional 50 for 
a total of 90 rifles and 90 scopes.  Akgul noted that the 
Turkish government -- specifically the Undersecretary for 
Defense Industries (SSM) -- tightly controlled the sale of 
firearms/hunting rifles, and MKEK was the sole authorized 
dealer.  MKEK planned to sell the rifles to qualified 
individuals with no criminal record.  Akgul said MKEK took 
the sale of firearms very seriously and did not want to run 
afoul of SSM by selling any firearms to people it did trust. 
 
¶2.  Akgul said that purchase order 002322 (noted in ref A) 
had been signed by Selma Kilic and Mustafa Aycicek and noted 
that Kilic is still with MKEK but that Aycicek has departed 
MKEK.  As noted in ref B, Aycicek had said that he was MKEK's 
"acting" procurement chief.  Regarding reftel A request for 
information on MKEK, we not that this was provided in ref B. 
 
 
¶3.  Basedon the site visit and meeting with Akgul, post 
supports the issuance of this license.
