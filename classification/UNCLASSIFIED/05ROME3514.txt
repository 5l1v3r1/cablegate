¶1.  (SBU) After being alerted by Alitalia, Italian Border 
Police prevented a passenger on the TSA "No Fly" list from 
boarding Milan-JFK flight 413 on Saturday, October 15.  The 
passenger, Lebanese national Mohammad Kassem HAGE (PP 30610, 
PDOB 24 Dec 1963, Lebanon), was attempting to travel to the 
United States on a valid G4 visa, apparently to work at the 
UN. 
 
¶2.  (U) Comment.  This is further evidence Alitalia has 
developed an effective and systematic program for complying 
with TSA's "No Fly" procedures.  End comment.
