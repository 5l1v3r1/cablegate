Media Highlights 
 
Obama Asks for More Troops (Radikal) 
Turkish 12/3 coverage of President Obama's Afghanistan strategy was 
robust, but mixed with most speculating that Turkey would resist 
calls for additional troops to Afghanistan.  The news dominated all 
major television channels, including leading NTV and CNNTurk, which 
headlined "Both Soldiers and Flexibility are Wanted."  Most TV 
interspersed video of President Obama's speech with montages of 
blue-hatted soldiers in Afghanistan with civilians.  Turkish papers 
also covered the new strategy, including Ambassador Jeffrey's 
remarks during a roundtable in Ankara, and reacted with mixed views. 
  Mainstream Hurriyet headline reads "Bargaining for Combat Troops" 
and reports that the US is calling all NATO countries, including 
Turkey, for more troops and more responsibilities in Afghanistan. 
Mainstream Milliyet headline reads "Rejecting Obama's Call" and says 
the US asked Turkey for combat troops but that PM Erdogan is 
expected to reject this request at his meeting with President Obama 
on December 7.  Liberal Radikal  columnist Murat Yetkin says 
"Turkish media might think that only Erdogan will have requests from 
Obama on December 7, however, Obama has some expectations too and 
there will be mutual requests on the agenda.  US call for additional 
troops in Afghanistan, was not conveyed  only to Turkey.  It's been 
understood that, US Ambassadors in all NATO countries, made similar 
statements as Ambassador Jeffrey made in Turkey.  MFA sources 
reiterate that Turkish troops in Afghanistan will not be involved in 
fighting but will increase their training and constructing duties. 
Besides, Turkish government and the opposition will never approve 
sending combat troops to Afghanistan.  However, this issue will 
definitely be on Obama-Erdogan meeting's agenda.  Mainstream Sabah 
quotes Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul saying that "Our reservations 
continue on our troops fighting in Afghanistan."  Sabah columnist 
Erdal Safak says in column on 12/3 "We understand that the US asks 
for flexibility on Turkish troops' responsibilities.  Turkish troops 
in Afghanistan are deployed in international security aid operation 
(ISAF), which is a NATO coalition.  Their primary duty is to train 
Afghan forces and to help in constructing the infrastructure in 
Afghanistan.  Now , the US is asking for combat troops.  This 
request is nothing else but a call for disaster.  It will mean 
Muslims killing Muslims.  The government and Turkish Armed Forces 
were always against sending combat troops to Afghanistan.  Other 
than the war in Korea, Turkey never fought in the operations under 
the UN and NATO umbrella.  Same thing will happen in Afghanistan and 
the duties of Turkish troops will remain the same."  Mainstream 
Vatan columnist Rusen Cakir says "Let's wait and see whether Obama 
will be successful in pulling Turkey into the swamp in Afghanistan. 
President Bush had exerted huge efforts to pull Turkey into Iraq 
swamp, to no avail." 
 
Morningstar Backs Turkey's Nuclear Desire (Yeni Safak) 
Papers report that on Wednesday, Richard Morningstar, the US special 
envoy for Eurasian energy, paid a visit to Ankara and met with 
Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.  Following his meeting with Minister 
Yildiz, Morningstar told a joint press conference that Iran was not 
in a position to become a part of the new energy projects in the 
southern corridor.  "If the relations with Iran are normalized and 
nuclear issues are resolved, it will of course be a positive 
development," emphasized Morningstar.  Islamist-oriented Zaman 
comments Morningstar criticized recent natural gas deals between 
Turkey and Iran, but adds that the US gave green light to joint oil 
exploration between Turkey and Iraq.  Morningstar said they wanted 
to see "very much" the inclusion of Iraqi gas in the Nabucco 
project, and added that the Iraqi government had to agree with the 
northern Iraqi leaders for the use of Iraqi natural gas in the 
project.  Under the headline, "US Cold to Iranian Gas," 
leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports Morningstar also said the US 
backed Turkey's nuclear energy aspirations. 
 
'Drug Fight' between Government, Drug Companies (Radikal) 
Liberal Radikal reports on its front page that in the face of a no 
avail in the talks with international medical companies over the 
 
ANKARA 00001716  002 OF 002 
 
 
price of drugs to be sold in Turkey, the Turkish government has 
unilaterally set the prices.  Turkey's 2009 budget has envisioned TL 
14.6 billion of share for medical drugs expenses.  After seeing that 
the actual expenses would be much higher, the government entered 
into negotiations with drug companies, asking them to lower prices. 
Following a couple "tense" meetings with the sector representatives, 
State Minister Ali Babacan left the negotiating table, saying the 
government would unilaterally fix the prices.  Radikal says a Swiss 
medical company told Babacan they cannot sell pharmaceuticals at the 
prices set by the government, and that the implementation would make 
the entrance of new drugs into Turkey "impossible."  Pharmacists 
will reportedly go on strike Friday to protest the government.
