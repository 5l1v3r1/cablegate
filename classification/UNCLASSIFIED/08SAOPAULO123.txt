"Reformers' Little Chances in Iran" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (3/12) 
editorialized: "Millions of Iranians will vote this Friday to elect 
their new Parliament.... Despite that, Iran is still far from being 
a democracy.  Between 2,000 and 6,000 of the Iranians who applied to 
run for a seat in the Parliament were rejected by the Council of 
Guardians, a 12-member collegiate headed by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 
the regime's supreme leader.... Unfortunately, no change should be 
expected from the elections: the performance of the reformers will 
be poor.  In addition to being harassed by the council, the group of 
reformers, which is led by former President Muhammad Khatami, is in 
lethargy.  The political dispute in Iran is no longer a dispute 
between reformers and conservatives.  It is now a dispute between 
moderate conservatives, such as Ali Larijani (former nuclear 
negotiator with the West), and radicals, under President Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad's leadership. The good news is that internal economic 
problems suggest difficulties for Ahmadinejad's allies."
