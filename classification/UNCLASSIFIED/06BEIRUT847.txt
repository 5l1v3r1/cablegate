¶1.  On March 9, Charge conveyed to Mohamed Baasiri, head of 
the Special Investigations Commission (SIC) of the Central 
Bank of Lebanon, reftel talking points and the text of a 
background paper provided by the Department.  These materials 
were also provided to Walid Alameddine, head of Lebanon's 
Banking Control Commission, also affiliated with the Central 
Bank of Lebanon.  On March 15, we provided to the Office of 
the  Governor of the Central Bank the text of the Section 311 
Final Rule as signed by the Department of the Treasury on 
March 9.  We have also conveyed the Section 311 Final Rule to 
the offices of the SIC, the Banking Control Commission, and

about the effect on Lebanese commercial banks of the Final 
Rule.  Subsequent exchanges with Washington as well as the 
issuance of the text of the Final Rule have at this point 
responded to the substance of Baasiri's questions.  We will 
remain alert to further inquiries from him or others in the 
Lebanese banking community about the impact of the Final Rule
