On March 3, 2009 national carrier Garuda Airlines announced a USD 
$346 million Boeing aircraft capital lease financing deal, the first 
contract enabled under the Cape Town Convention (CTC).  Post's 
Foreign Commercial Service and Economic Section together with the 
U.S. Export Import Bank (ExIm) worked extensively with Indonesian 
parliament and industry representatives to implement the CTC through 
the civil aviation legislation passed on December 17, 2008 (reftel). 
 The President of Indonesia signed the bill into law in January. 
The law with respect to CTC protects creditor interests and allows 
prompt asset recovery of Indonesian registered aircraft in the case 
of a non-performing loan.  The financing for the Garuda deal is 
guaranteed by ExIm in cooperation with Dubai Aerospace Enterprises.
