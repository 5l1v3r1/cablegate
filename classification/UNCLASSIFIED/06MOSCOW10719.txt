¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export

¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, (A) 
Vnesh Opt Torg and (B) FSUE Scientific and Tech. 
Atlas, Moscow, Russia. The companies are listed on BIS

of titanium coils, model S-3-W, ST3. These items are 
controlled for chemical or biological warfare reasons 
under ECCN 2B350. The licensee is Serfilco Ltd., 2900

¶3. On September 12, 2006 Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of Vnesh 
Opt Torg (VOT). The team met with Yekaterina Grachova, 
Accountant. 
 
¶4. VOT is a new company, founded in May 2006 as an 
"external economic activities" organization.  The 
company specializes in procurement and importation of 
foreign produced goods for Russian end users, as well 
as freight forwarding services for Russian clients. 
The company has a wide variety of clients in many 
sectors.  The company is familiar with export controls 
as it has dealt with U.S. companies before, and is 
well versed in the import and export regulations of 
the Russian Federation. The company will not be an end 
user of the product, and has no additional information 
on the end use and end user. 
 
¶5. On September 15, 2006, Export Control Attache 
Donald Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of Federal 
State Unitary Enterprise - Scientific and Technical 
Center Atlas, Moscow, Russia. The export control team 
met with Vyachyeslav Polikarpov, Chief. 
 
¶6. Atlas was founded in 1951 to research and develop 
products for use in electronic communications, and 
branched into new technologies throughout its history. 
The organization employs over 1000, and is currently 
focused on telecommunications, information technology 
systems, mobile telephone security systems, and other 
communications electronics research.  In addition, 
Atlas has been tasked with production of security 
devices for identification products such as passports, 
visas and other identity documents.  Atlas is 
currently working on the chip technology for use in 
biometric identity documents such as the new Russian 
passport. 
 
¶7. The Holographic Department was founded in 1992 to 
produce security features for official documents.  The 
company has a full production facility, from design of 
the emblem or logo to mass production of holograms. 
The Holographic Department has little interaction with 
other parts of the company, as it is a specialized 
operation.  End users of the holograms are various 
government and private sector end users. Certain 
holograms are also produced for commercial use, 
advertising and the like. 
 
¶8. The coils in reftel will be used in the electrolyte 
bath used in the production of holograms.  Currently 
the line is using equipment purchased in 1993, which 
is slowly being phased out as Atlas procures new 
devices.  The coils will be used to maintain a 
constant temperature in the electrolyte bath, a 
critical element in producing holograms.  Two or three 
specialists will utilize the systems to produce 
holograms.  The coils will be incorporated into the 
baths of the rotary plate and ordinary plate systems. 
The systems are in a limited access facility with a 
high security regime. 
 
¶9. Recommendations: Post recommends (A) Vnesh Opt Torg 
and (B) Federal State Unitary Enterprise - Scientific 
and Technical Center Atlas, Moscow, Russia, as 
reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities. It is requested that post be notified of 
final disposition of the application, and of any 
shipments for this organization in order to conduct 
 
 
appropriate FCS follow-up and statistical reporting.
