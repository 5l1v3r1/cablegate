(U) On May 31, Poloff delivered reftel points to Charles 
Kingston; Policy Officer; United Nations, Human Rights,

to representatives at the Ministry of Health and New Zealand 
AID (NZAID).  Kingston is the principal liaison at MFAT 
regarding New Zealand's participation in multilateral heath

before the high-level meeting on HIV/AIDS begins on May 31. 
He indicated that he would convey as soon as possible any 
response received.
