¶1.  A March 16 Business Day article reported that the 
information and communications technology (ICT) charter 
steering committee was being reorganized to draw up a new 
empowerment charter for the industry.  However, Department 
of Communications Director of Policy and chair of the 
current consultative process Joe Mjwara told a Reuters 
reporter that the Business Day story was "without 
foundation." 
 
¶2.  Mjwara acknowledged that the original March deadline for 
finalizing the ICT Charter has been extended to June to 
allow the steering committee to resolve outstanding issues 
including equity ownership, composition of the industry 
council monitoring Charter compliance, and whether state- 
owned ICT companies should abide by the ICT Charter or 
targets published by the regulatory body (Independent 
Communications Authority of South Africa). 
 
¶3.  In November 2004, the ICT Charter working group 
delivered a fifth draft of the charter to a new steering 
committee for resolution of outstanding issues. The new 
committee is operating under the auspices of the National 
Economic Development and Labor Council (NEDLAC) and includes 
representation from business, labor, government, community, 
and civil society.  Industry sources and an American Chamber 
of Commerce official told Econoff that this consultative 
process has generated a refined version of the ICT Charter, 
reducing it from 100 pages to approximately 20.  Post is 
seeking to obtain a copy of this document.
