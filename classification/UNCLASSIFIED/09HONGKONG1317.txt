SUBJECT: HONG KONG H1N1 UPDATE - FIRST POSSIBLE 
H1N1-RELATED DEATH 
 
REF: A. A) HONG KONG 1109

¶1.  Summary:  Hong Kong and Macau both continue to see 
increases in confirmed H1N1 cases.  In Hong Kong, the total 
number of confirmed H1N1 cases surpassed 1,500 on July 16, 
while Macau is approaching 100 total cases.  The number of 
H1N1 patients admitted to hospitals in Hong Kong continues to 
slowly rise.  Reports surfaced July 16 of the first possible 
H1N1-related death in Hong Kong.  Tests are underway to 
determine if H1N1 was a primary or contributing factor in the 
July 10 death of a 42-year-old sailor who died in hospital. 
The Hong Kong Government (HKG) has no plans to modify their 
procedures to combat H1N1 at this time.  End Summary. 
 
Reported Infections Continue Climbing 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Hong Kong exceeded 1,500 confirmed H1N1 infections July 
16 when the HKG announced 85 new cases, for a total of 1,552. 
 There have been, on average, 50 new cases identified per day 
during the last three weeks.  Despite the increasing 
infection rate, HKG health officials consider the response 
measures currently in place (Ref A) adequate as they continue 
to focus on mitigation of the effects of the virus and 
provide care for individuals with serious complications. 
 
¶3.  Macau health officials report 94 confirmed cases since 
the first positive case was identified June 18 (Ref B).  Less 
than one week later Macau identified the first community 
transmission case, and currently one-third of the cases in 
Macau have been contracted through community transmission. 
Macau continues to combat the spread of the virus through 
isolation of H1N1-positive individuals and home quarantine 
for close contacts. 
 
HK Hospitalizations Increase, Officials ID First Possible 
Death 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
¶4.  The number of patients admitted to hospital for treatment 
in Hong Kong continues to slowly climb.  On July 16, the HKG 
reported 23 H1N1 patients in public hospitals for treatment. 
Of these, three patients are categorized "serious" and two 
patients "critical."  The most vulnerable individuals in Hong 
Kong appear to be the same as reported in other locations ) 
individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, especially 
respiratory problems.  At least one of the seriously ill 
patients, however, does not fit this profile ) a 23-year-old 
college student with no pre-existing medical conditions. 
 
¶5.  On July 16, Centre for Health Protection (CHP) Controller 
Dr. Thomas Tsang announced that Hong Kong may have had its 
first H1N1-related fatality.  A 42-year-old Filipino sailor 
who died at Ruttonjee Hospital July 10 of 
community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (CA-MRSA) later tested positive for H1N1.  The man 
reportedly fell ill while aboard ship and was unable to 
receive treatment for several days until his vessel returned 
to Hong Kong.  Tsang stated that H1N1 could have been a 
factor in the man's death, and added that he likely 
contracted the virus outside of Hong Kong.  CHP officials 
confirm that an autopsy has been ordered, and that it will 
take several days to determine whether H1N1 was the primary 
cause or a contributing factor in the man's death. 
 
¶6.  The HKG does not intend to modify the procedures in place 
to combat H1N1, despite the increase in hospitalizations and 
the possible H1N1-related death.  Hong Kong's serious illness 
rate is consistent with the rates reported worldwide and the 
death rate ) 0.06% if the reported H1N1-related death is 
confirmed ) is lower than the world average.  One issue that 
would provoke a review and possible change in response 
measures is a mutation of the virus, making it much more 
lethal or drug resistant.  CHP officials continue to closely 
monitor developments here and around the world for signs of 
such a change.
