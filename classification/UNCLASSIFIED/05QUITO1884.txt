"Bolivarian Democracy", an editorial (08/14) in 
populist "La Hora" (circ. 160,000) 
 
Quote:  ".Chavez has been erratic, arbitrary and has 
made the mistake of locking horns with key 
institutions, like the Catholic Church, the media, 
the private sector and unions.  But, at the same 
time, it is also true that he has begun to win over 
various South American countries, including Ecuador . 
 
"Venezuela has become a point of reference for all 
the impoverished people of the region.
