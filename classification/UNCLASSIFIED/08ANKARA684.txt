In Today's Papers 
 
EU Commissioner Visits Turkey amid Political Confusion 
All papers report on Thursday, EU Commission President Jose Manuel 
Barroso and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn will visit Turkey 
amid ongoing internal debates regarding the closure case against the 
AKP and delays in Turkey's EU harmonization reforms. 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet and some mainstream papers speculate 
the AKP proposal to change articles 301 and 305 of the penal code 
prove the AKP is seeking closer ties to the EU.  CHP deputy group 
chairmen Kemal Kilicdaroglu, Kemal Anadol and Hakki Suha Okay held a 
press conference at the parliament yesterday; they publicly warned 
Barroso that the Turkish constitution restricts public comments 
related to ongoing constitutional lawsuits.  Liberal Radikal says 
Barroso is coming to Turkey in order to push for reforms, but the 
suit banning the AKP will also be raised during his meetings. 
Mainstream Milliyet, under the headline "EU Tensions in Ankara," 
says, "All eyes are turned to the EU officials' visit as the 
Ergenekon investigation and the suit for banning the AKP continue." 
In addition, Milliyet notes, "Barroso's comments will be closely 
followed by the opposition."  Milliyet expects CHP Leader Deniz 
Baykal to criticize the EU for its double standard regarding 
Turkey's EU reforms, namely regarding EU support for Turkey's 
struggle against the PKK.  Islamist-oriented Zaman writes, "The CHP 
Bets All of Its Cards on Article 301," and "the CHP has drawn 
attention to itself by preventing two important developments in 
Turkish-EU relations - revising articles 301 and 305 of the penal 
code. The CHP voted against the revision of 301 and 305, which were 
due to be on the parliamentary agenda during Barroso's visit." 
Zaman columnist Sahin Alpay argues the current crisis in Turkey is, 
"about the West's withdrawal of its support for the AKP, the AKP's 
efforts to seek compromise with the establishment, and its failure 
to maintain determination to complete the democratization process." 
 
 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet says Barroso will meet Greek Orthodox 
Patriarch Bartholomew I in Istanbul.  In order to avoid controversy 
over the 'Ecumenical' title of the Patriarch, the Turkish Foreign 
Ministry (MFA) asked Barroso to also meet the Mufti of Istanbul, 
says the paper. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkey-EU Relations 
 
Semih Idiz wrote in mainstream Milliyet (4/10): "There is a need for 
the EU to be strong about both democracy and secularism. Both the 
President of the EU Commission Manuel Barroso and the EU Enlargement 
Commissioner Olli Rehn have made public statements against the 
closure of AKP, and I completely agree with them.  Yet, I wish in 
their statement they emphasized secularism as much as they 
emphasized democracy.  We should criticize anti-EU groups but at the 
same time we, including Barroso and Rehn, should also question the 
sincerity of AKP's pro-EU stance.  Obviously, the ruling AKP has 
reignited its EU enthusiasm due to internal political developments. 
Both democracy and secularism have to be equally protected because 
they are indispensable in a modern and developed country.  Things 
are not going well for either democracy or secularism in Turkey. 
While battling those who are against democracy, the EU should not 
appear as if they tolerate those who seek to dilute secularism." 
 
Murat Yetkin wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal (4/10): "EU 
Commission President Manuel Barroso's remarks prior to his trip to 
Ankara created some anxiety, especially among the opposition parties 
in parliament.  Both MHP and CHP affirm the EU is not supposed to 
interfere with ongoing judicial matters.  In addition, the EU is not 
supposed to take sides with a particular political party, i.e. the 
ruling AKP.  Even within the AKP, there are some who are pleased 
with Barroso's remarks, and there are some who are worried by his 
remarks.  The EU acts like an overseeing authority among its members 
and is likely to interfere with other domestic issues as well.  The 
AKP may not be happy with the EU's meddling in the future, depending 
 
ANKARA 00000684  002 OF 003 
 
 
on which issues the EU targets.  The gist of this issue is about 
understanding the way EU membership changes the course of the 
nation-state model.  In that regard, all members of the EU accept 
and recognize the overseeing structure of the Union.  This means the 
EU structure meddles in members' domestic affairs, particularly 
regarding freedoms, human rights, common democratic values and the 
separation of state and religion.  Barroso has a difficult task.  He 
now has to persuade both the ruling government and the opposition 
parties on these fundamental aspects of the European Union." 
 
CHP Delays Discussion of Article 301 in Parliament 
Islamist-oriented Zaman reports under the headline, "The CHP Blocks 
Parliament's Goodwill Gesture in Reforming Article 301" that," 
acting Parliament Speaker Guldal Mumcu of the CHP did not submit 
article 301 changes to the parliament because she said the issue was 
"not very important," and that Speaker Koksal Toptan "could initiate 
the procedures when returns to Turkey from China." 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak says, "Mumcu could have submitted the 
changes to parliament in honor of her husband Ugur Mumcu, a 
journalist who was assassinated in 1993."  Mainstream Sabah writes, 
"Opposition parties CHP and MHP cooperate to block reforms in 
article 301, with CHP working to delay the reforms while the MHP 
threatens to apply to the Constitutional Court for scrapping them." 
Islamist-oriented Zaman says, "The AKP is also preparing an 
extensive package of democratization reforms which include 
affirmative action for women, children's rights, and environmental 
protection." 
 
Poll: Closure Case Increases AKP Voters' EU Support 
Milliyet and Radikal carry a survey conducted by A&G polling company 
for Turkey's prime-time television Kanal D, which shows 41.9 percent 
of AKP supporters say Turkey should join the EU.  27.7 percent 
oppose Turkey's EU accession while 24.0 percent say EU accession 
will not make a difference.  Milliyet says support among the AKP 
voters for Turkey's EU membership increased following the launch of 
the closure case against the ruling party.  AKP voters' support for 
Turkey's EU membership was 54.7 percent in 2005, this year it stands 
at 47.1 percent in April, which is up from 29.5 percent in January. 
 
 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet carries a survey conducted by 
Political Research Company, according to which 85 percent believe 
AKP's headscarf policy caused tension in the country.  84.2 percent 
say people live their faith freely in Turkey.  67.9 percent think 
there's no headscarf problem in Turkey while 18.4 percent believe 
the opposite.  37.3 percent find the closure case against the AKP 
"right," whereas 49.2 percent find it "wrong."  The survey canvassed 
the views of 2,470 adults in 20 provinces through one-on-one 
interviews from April 1-6. 
 
Crocker: Turkish Operations Draw Iraqi Kurds Closer to Baghdad 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others report 
U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker testified yesterday at the U.S. 
Congress.  He noted, "The Turkish ground offensive into northern 
Iraq made the Iraqi Kurds realize the importance of being a part of 
the Iraqi identity," and "this drew them closer to the Baghdad 
Administration."  Liberal Radikal quotes Crocker as saying, "Both 
the Iraqi and Turkish governments are trying to strengthen ties; 
President Talabani paid a successful visit to Turkey in March." 
 
Diyarbakir Delegation Gives President Gul Report on Southeast 
Turkey 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Radikal, Taraf, Cumhuriyet, Yeni Safak and 
others report a delegation including representatives of NGOs from 
the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir met with President Abdullah 
Gul on Wednesday.  They submitted a report to the President, asking 
for affirmative action for the region including improvement of the 
regional infrastructure and support for border trade.  The report 
notes it is important for Turkey to maintain good ties with 
neighboring countries.  President Gul called for resolving the 
 
ANKARA 00000684  003 OF 003 
 
 
problems within the framework of democracy, saying everything could 
be discussed as long as violence and terror are shunned.
