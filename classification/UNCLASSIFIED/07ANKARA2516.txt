In Today's Papers 
 
US House Committee Approves Armenian Genocide Resolution 
All papers report that despite the warnings issued by US President 
Bush and his Administration, the US House of Representatives 
Committee on Foreign Affairs approved a resolution concerning the 
incidents of 1915 27 votes to 21.  Papers highlighted the last 
minute efforts by President Bush and his Administration to prevent 
passage of the resolution.  President Bush appeared on CNN just 2 
hours before the voting and urged the Committee to oppose the 
resolution.  Secretary Rice also made a statement saying that the 
resolution would have a destabilizing effect on US interests in the 
Middle East.  Secretary of Defense Gates said that the US needs the 
logistical support of Turkey in Iraq.  Mainstream Hurriyet reports 
that the meeting of the Committee was opened with prayers of 
Armenian Patriarch Karekin II. 
 
President Gul termed the decision of the House Committee as 
unacceptable and added that Turkish people do not respect it. 
 
Motion for Cross-Border Operation Ready to be Sent to Parliament 
All papers cite PM Erdogan's CNN Turk interview as a source to 
report that the motion asking authorization from Parliament for a 
cross-border operation into Iraq would be presented to Parliament 
either today or following the long holiday weekend.  PM said that 
the duration of the authorization will be one year.  "Turkey is not 
aiming at the territorial integrity of Iraq, however, neither the 
Iraqi administration nor the US have done anything.  Turkey has run 
out of patience and needs to see actions rather than words," added 
PM Erdogan. 
 
Meanwhile, papers report that operations against PKK terrorists 
continue intensively in Sirnak.  Tanks have been sent to the region. 
 F-16, F-4 and Cobra helicopters are bombing the area between Kupeli 
and Gabar mountains.  And demonstrations to protest terrorist 
incidents have been held in Denizli, Mersin, Zonguldak, Adana, 
Antalya, Sanli Urfa, Izmir and Rize. 
 
"CBO and Question Marks" 
Ergun Babahan wrote in mainstream daily Sabah (10/11): "Turkey 
should be careful not to present the image that it is planning an 
operation against all Kurds, rather than just the PKK. Such 
perceptions will help the terrorist organization to garner more 
support in the region.  In fact, this may be a reason for some 
deliberate efforts by the PKK to drag Turkey into Northern Iraq. 
The ADP parliamentary deputies from Turkey's southeast region are 
talking about the disadvantages of a cross border operation, and 
their voices should definitely be taken into account." 
 
"Don't Leave Everything to the Hands of Military" 
Hasan Cemal wrote in the mainstream daily Milliyet (10/11): "This 
issue is too complex to wait for a miracle solution or an overnight 
solution.  This is not a solely PKK or terrorism issue.  The roots 
of the problem go way back - much earlier and deeper - and we can 
simply call it the Kurdish problem.  The problem is gaining more 
international prominence with the help of the Iraqi Kurdish entity. 
We should be thinking about minimal goals to work towards, including 
a comprehensive reform process, and take steps towards civilian 
initiatives to marginalize violence and terror.  Civilian 
initiatives must be the key for solution.  We should not leave 
everything in the hands of military." 
 
"Terror Is a Game By Itself" 
Fehmi Koru wrote in the Islamist-leaning daily Yeni Safak (10/11): 
"The mounting PKK terror is leading us to address the situation in 
Northern Iraq in a way which advocates anger and calls for cross 
border operations.  Especially in times such as this, it is better 
to think twice and in an unemotional manner.  Looking at the issue 
from a distance, it is clear that the PKK is trying to drag us into 
Northern Iraq and once we go ahead with the cross border operation,

the terrorists will be even happier.  We better realize the game 
being played and think outside the box before we are hit by another 
terror wave."
