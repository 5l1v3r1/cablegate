SUBJECT: CSIS-SANDIA IN TURKEY FOR GLOBAL WATER PROJECT 
 
 
¶1.  Summary: Collaborating on policy and technology aspects of their 
"Global Water Futures" project, CSIS (Center for Strategic Studies) 
and Sandia National Laboratories sent a joint delegation to Turkey 
as one of five countries of focus in the second phase of the 
project.  The Delegation met with the Embassy, the Water 
Administration (DSI), the GAP administration, and the Minister of 
Agriculture, and participated in a roundtable on global water 
challenges at a local think tank.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  CSIS and Sandia Labs have collaborated on a "Global Water 
Futures" project whose first phase produced a broad range of policy 
and technology solutions on global water challenges.  The current 
second phase aims to identify in more specific terms how water 
availability, water quality, and water management affect economic 
development, public health, stability, and security at a regional 
level.  Selecting Turkey as one of five countries facing a variety 
of water challenges, the project aims to complete a field study 
focusing on diverse water issues such as the role of agriculture in 
the economy, the development of irrigation to support agriculture, 
trends in water and sanitation management, transboundary rivers and 
prospects for integrated water resource management, the development 
of water infrastructure and its effects on economic development, the 
ongoing efforts of the Southeast Anatolia Project (GAP) and water 
basin management. 
 
¶3.  The seven person delegation was led by Erik Pederson, Senior VP, 
CSIS and Peter Davies, Director, Sandia Labs Geoscience and 
Environment Center.  The Embassy briefed the team on November 13 on 
Turkey's trans-boundary issues, dialogue wih neighbors, long 
process on the water portionof the environment chapter for EU 
accession, and Ilisu Dam (determination to move forward, with or 
without European financing).  Sandia's Howard Passell briefed on the 
successful hydrographic modeling workshop held just before in Amman 
with participants from Turkish and Syrian NGOs and Iraqi government 
officials, noting that it had contributed to technical confidence 
building.  The CSIS-Sandia team also met with MFA, DSI (water 
administration), GAP, and the Minister of Agriculture, and 
participated in a water roundtable at a local think-tank on 
approaches to global water problems.  Part of the team was going to 
continue on to Istanbul to focus on water and sanitation management 
in that "mega-city".
