SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON CALLS FOR DELAY OF ZIMBABWE POLL 
 
¶1. After resolutions by both the Senate and the House of 
Representatives urging the Nigerian government to intervene 
in the Zimbabwe crisis, the GON publicly called for the 
postponement of Zimbabwe's presidential run-off.  The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement late on June 
26 which said that "Nigeria joins the Southern African 
Development Community (SADC) and well-meaning friends of 
Zimbabwe in calling for a postponement of the election.  In 
the present circumstances, it is doubtful if a credible 
run-off election can be held in Zimbabwe."  The MFA statement 
also "calls on the government of Zimbabwe to take up the 
offer of fresh negotiations with a view to restoring normalcy 
and a congenial atmosphere for free and fair elections in the 
country." 
 
¶2. According to press accounts, Nigeria's Senate adopted a 
motion June 25 which called on President Yar'Adua to "join 
the African Union and United Nations in encouraging President 
Mugabe to step down."  The Senators also asked President 
Yar'Adua to "appeal for the people's choice to be respected" 
and to ask the GOZ to "stop political violence, harassment, 
and intimidation."  On June 26, the House of Representatives 
also took up the issue of Zimbabwe's election.  The House 
resolved to "urge the President of the Federal Republic of 
Nigeria to leverage the leadership position of Nigeria and 
its inherent goodwill to mid-wife an immediate cessation of 
hostilities between supporters of the ruling party and those 
of the opposing parties in order to halt (Zimbabwe's) 
imminent decline into anarchy."  The resolution also called 
on the Nigerian President to meet with other leaders of the 
African Union to try to bring together the Zimbabwean 
government and opposition to agree upon "a mutually 
beneficial political agreement until proper elections can be 
held under the close scrutiny of international observers." 
 
¶3. Nigerian Foreign Minister Ojo Maduekwe also told 
Ambassador just before his departure to the U.S. on July 19 
that he had been in contact with the Zimbabwean Foreign 
Minister at the behest of President Yar'Adua to encourage a 
more transparent process. 
 
¶4. Comment: Post will follow up with MFA and National 
Assembly contacts to obtain full texts of the House, Senate, 
and MFA statements on Zimbabwe and forward them via email to 
AF/W and AF/S.  It is unusual for the GON to speak out so 
publicly and harshly on domestic politics of another African 
nation, especially one outside the West African region, 
although they do so in private.  The GON statements, though 
only one day ahead of the June 27 run-off poll, are better 
late than never and may bode well for African Union 
initiatives on Zimbabwe next week at the Summit in Sharm 
El-Sheikh.  End Comment.
