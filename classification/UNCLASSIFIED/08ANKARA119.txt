In Today's Papers 
 
Controversial Sudanese Guest in Turkey 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Zaman, Yeni Safak, Sabah, Vatan and others: 
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir's visit to Turkey is criticized by 
many in the international community.  Mainstream Vatan writes 'the 
world's bloodiest dictator has come to Ankara.' At the joint press 
conference following the presidents' meeting, President Gul said "we 
want to solve the problem within the framework of Sudanese 
sovereignty and territorial integrity, through peaceful means.  We 
will continue to give the necessary support to Sudan."    President 
Gul described the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians in 
Darfur as a "humanitarian drama" instead of using the term 
'genocide.'  Cumhuriyet and Hurriyet report the visit with a 
headline 'world's most controversial leader is in Ankara.'  The 
Sudanese President will travel to Istanbul today to hold meetings 
with Turkish and Sudanese businessmen. 
 
Gungor Mengi comments in mainstream Vatan (1/22):  "Sudanese 
President Omar al-Bashir's previous requests to visit Turkey were 
kindly declined by former president Sezer.  Omar al-Bashir is held 
responsible for the massacre of 200,000 people.  He is considered 
the bloodiest dictator in the world today.  This very dictator was 
in Turkey as an official guest of the president of Turkey.  Once Gul 
took over the presidency from Sezer, the composition of foreign 
visitors changed.  A close look at al-Bashir's past record makes the 
situation even more interesting.  He led a coup in 1989.  Soon 
after, he banned all political parties and declared Sheria law.  He 
declared a new constitution to limit the opposition's power and 
launched a coup against the parliament when they criticized him. 
All of this tells us one thing: al-Bashir is the kind of leader the 
ruling AKP likes very much.  It is good to keep in mind the old 
Anatolian saying, 'crows fly with crows.'" 
 
Mehmet Y. Yilmaz comments in mainstream Hurriyet (1/22):  "Omar 
al-Bashir is no ordinary guest.  When the Sudanese President comes 
to Turkey as an official guest of the Turkish president, it means he 
is a guest of Turkish Republic.  However, there is a problem here. 
This guest is accused, by respected institutions around the world, 
of genocide.  He is held responsible for the deaths of 200,000 
people and the displacement of more than 2 million people in Darfur. 
 Why and how can Omar al-Bashir enjoy official treatment here while 
he is alienated internationally because of his crimes against 
humanity?  Let's bear in mind that al-Bashir also brought Islamist 
fundamentalism and Sheria law to Sudan.  I can't help but wonder if 
this warm relationship between Presidents al-Bashir and Gul could be 
based on a feeling of Islamic brotherhood?" 
 
 
Parliament Speaker Toptan: "There is No Power Superior to 
Parliament" 
Sabah, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Yeni Safak, Zaman and others:  In a press 
conference, Parliamentary Speaker Koksal Toptan criticized 
statements from Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya, Chief Public Prosecutor of 
Supreme Court and Council of State, about turban and said that "the 
judiciary does not have the right to resist against the decisions 
that the legislative power makes.  No institution or person has the 
right to put itself in parliament's place." 
 
Intelligence Sharing with Israel to be Increased 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports that Israeli Defense Minister 
Ehud Barak will come to Turkey in February to meet with Defense 
Minister Vecdi Gonul.  Diplomatic circles note that the purpose of 
Barak's visit is to continue bilateral dialogue concerning defense. 
Intelligence sharing, defense industry coordination, terrorism and 
regional security is on the agenda of the meetings. 
 
TGS Chief Buyukanit in London 
Sabah, Milliyet, Vatan, Hurriyet, Yeni Safak:  Chief of General 
Staff (TGS) General Yasar Buyukanit met with his British counterpart 
 
ANKARA 00000119  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
General Richard Dannet yesterday in London.  Their talks focused on 
Turkish air operations against the PKK in northern Iraq.  Mainstream 
Sabah reports that around 200 PKK supporters in London staged 
protests against the visit and the cross border operations. 
 
Armenian Deputy FM Calls Turkey for Dialogue: In an interview with 
nationalist-oriented Cumhuriyet, (January 20), Armenian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Arman Kirakosian expressed hope for the 
normalization of bilateral ties with Turkey.  Emphasizing that 
Armenia does not have any preconditions to the start a dialogue, 
Kirakosian said Turkey and Armenia are capable of addressing a 
series of issues.  Regarding the Armenian Diaspora, the Deputy FM 
said that Armenia does not have any power to exert pressure on the 
Diaspora.  He also added that the Black Sea Economic Cooperation 
could be a proper forum for Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan to 
normalize their ties. 
 
Greek PM Karamanlis to come to Turkey January 23 
Sabah, Milliyet, Hurriyet:  Greek PM Karamanlis will arrive in 
Ankara tomorrow on an official visit.  Hurriyet reports that 
Karamanlis will visit Anitkabir, despite the objections of the 
political right wing in his country.  Milliyet reports that main 
opposition party CHP leader Deniz Baykal will meet with Karamanlis 
on Thursday at the Sheraton Hotel.  Karamanlis will be received by 
President Gul before he goes to Istanbul to meet with Fener Greek 
Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomeos.
