following PRST on ICTY/ICTR due to be adopted on December 19, 
¶2008. 
 
¶2. Begin text: 
 
The Security Council recalls its  resolution 827 (1993) of 25 
May 1993 which established the International Tribunal for the 
former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and its resolution 955 (1994) of 8 
November 1994 which established the International Criminal 
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) (the Tribunals) and further 
recalls that resolution 1503 (2003) of 28 August 2003 called 
upon the Tribunals to take all possible measures to complete 
all trial activities at first instance by the end of 2008 and 
to complete all work in 2010 (the Completion strategies), and 
that resolution 1534 (2004) of 26 March 2004 emphasized the 
importance of fully implementing the Completion Strategies. 
 
The Security Council recalls that the Tribunals were 
established in particular circumstances of the former 
Yugoslavia and Rwanda as an ad hoc measure contributing to 
the restoration and maintenance of peace. 
 
The Security Council takes note of the presentations made on 
12 December 2008 by the Presidents and Prosecutors of the 
Tribunals to the Security Council on the implementation of 
the Completion Strategies. 
 
Noting with concern that the deadline for completion of trial 
activities at first instance has not been met and that the 
Tribunals have indicated that their work is not likely to end 
in 2010, the Security Council emphasizes that trials must be 
conducted by the Tribunals as quickly and efficiently as 
possible and expresses its determination to support their 
efforts toward the completion of their work at the earliest 
date. 
 
The Security Council reaffirms the necessity of persons 
indicted by the ICTY and ICTR being brought to justice. 
 
The Security Council calls on all States, especially States 
where fugitives are suspected to be at large, to further 
intensify cooperation with and render all necessary 
assistance to the ICTY and ICTR, as appropriate, in 
particular to achieve the arrest and surrender of all 
remaining fugitive indictees. 
 
The Council also reaffirms in this context that the referral 
of cases to competent national jurisdictions is an essential 
part of the Completion Strategies and in this regard 
underlines again the need for the Tribunals to concentrate 
their work on the prosecution and trial of the most senior 
leaders suspected of being most responsible for crimes within 
their jurisdiction and urges the Tribunals to work with 
relevant national authorities to secure the transfer of cases 
which do not involve this level of responsibility for 
prosecution by competent national jurisdictions. 
 
The Security Council acknowledges the need to establish an ad 
hoc mechanism to carry out a number of essential functions of 
the Tribunals, including the trial of high level fugitives, 
after the closure of the Tribunals. In view of the 
substantially reduced nature of these residual functions, 
this mechanism should be a small, temporary, and efficient 
structure. Its functions and size will diminish over time. 
Its expenses will be expenses of the Organisation in 
accordance with Article 17 of the Charter of the United 
Nations. 
 
The Security Council emphasizes that any such mechanism will 
derive its authority from a Security Council resolution and 
from Statutes and Rules of Procedure and Evidence based on 
those existing for the ICTY and the ICTR, modified as 
appropriate, and that accommodations may be needed to address 
the differing needs and circumstances of the ICTY and the 
ICTR. 
 
The Security Council expresses its appreciation to its 
Informal Working Group on International Tribunals for its 
work to date on the establishment of this mechanism, 
including through a thorough examination of which functions 
of the Tribunals are necessary for the administration of 
justice after their closure.The Security Council requests the 
Informal Working Group on International Tribunals to continue 
its efforts in that regard and to concentrate on the main 
outstanding issues with a view to drafting as soon as 
possible appropriate instruments necessary for the 
performance of residual functions of the Tribunals. 
 
In order to facilitate the further work of the Informal 
Working Group on International Tribunals, the Security 
Council requests the Secretary-General to present a report 
within 90 days on the administrative and budgetary aspects of 
the options for possible locations for the Tribunals, 
archives and the seat of the residual mechanism, including 
the availability of suitable premises for the conduct of 
judicial proceedings by the residual mechanism, with 
particular emphasis on locations where the United Nations has 
an existing presence. 
 
The Security Council requests the Secretariat to provide the 
Informal Working Group with all necessary assistance, 
including interpretation in the six working languages of the 
Council.
