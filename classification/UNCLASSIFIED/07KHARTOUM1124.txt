¶1. Summary:  This cable declares a disaster due to flooding in Sudan 
and requests U.S. Government (USG) emergency assistance for those in 
need.  Unseasonably heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding since 
late June have affected hundreds of thousands people in Khartoum, 
Northern Kordofan, White Nile, Kassala, Red Sea, Gezira, Sennar, and 
Blue Nile states in northern Sudan, according to Government of 
National Unity (GNU) officials and humanitarian organizations. 
Exact numbers of damaged and destroyed houses, displaced 
individuals, and deaths remain difficult to ascertain, as many 
flood-affected areas are still unreachable.  Assessments are 
ongoing.  To date, the U.N. and partners have distributed supplies 
to 111,000 flood-affected people.  As of July 19, the most-affected 
areas are Northern Kordofan, Khartoum, and Kassala states.  The USG 
has been in contact with the GNU, U.N. agencies, and 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to coordinate a response for 
flood-affected communities.  In lieu of requesting the Ambassador's 
Authority funds of USD 50,000, post understands that USAID's Office 
of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) intends to provide 
USD 300,000 to the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) for distribution of 
emergency relief supplies in flood-affected areas.  Post concurs 
with this decision and additional assistance will be requested of 
USAID/OFDA if needed.  End summary. 
 
----------------- 
Current Situation 
----------------- 
 
¶2. Water levels along the Blue Nile River and the Gash River 
continue to rise to levels that threaten further flooding in the 
coming weeks.  The current flooding began a month earlier than the 
seasonal flooding in 2006.  Many agencies fear that the flood season 
will be prolonged and damages in 2007 will exceed those in 2006. 
Relief agencies and local authorities have not yet been able to 
access and assess all flood-affected areas, but plan to do so in the 
coming weeks. 
 
¶3. Khartoum State:  In the Khartoum area, heavy rainfall since July 
7 has destroyed between 6,300 and 6,800 houses and affected 
approximately 12,650 households, according to USAID, NGOs, and 
government officials.  USAID partner CARE and other NGOs have 
distributed relief supplies to more than 5,000 families in Jebel 
Aulia and Mayo internally displaced person (IDP) camps in Khartoum. 
Humanitarian agencies have requested that the GNU clear blocked 
channels in the camps to open drainage to prevent additional 
flooding and mitigate the spread of waterborne diseases.  On July 
18, USAID staff visited Khartoum North and reported that the state 
and local government agencies have done an excellent job of meeting 
needs following flooding in low-lying rural areas. 
 
¶4. Northern Kordofan State:  Northern Kordofan State is currently 
among the most-affected areas due to excessive flooding caused by 
heavy rainfall.  According to the U.N. Joint Logistics Center 
(UNJLC) and UNICEF, heavy rains on July 7 affected an estimated 
12,000 households in the state, including El Obeid, a major 
logistics hub for the humanitarian operation in Sudan.  UNJLC and 
UNICEF cautioned that 12,000 is an estimated planning figure only, 
and that many affected areas remain inaccessible, making it 
difficult to report on damaged or destroyed homes.  As of July 14, 
some villages remained inaccessible by road and were unable to 
communicate using telephone or radio.  A joint U.N., NGO, and GNU 
Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) committee has been established to 
coordinate flood response.  As of July 14, the Northern Kordofan 
State Government claimed to have distributed 1,000 sacks of 90 kg 
sorghum per locality, as well as 800 tents, 5,700 plastic sheets and 
500 mosquito nets for the six localities.  However, no independent 
sources can confirm that such assistance has been provided.  The 
Sudanese Red Crescent Society (SRC) distributed 110 tents, 500 
plastic sheets, and 425 blankets in different locations.  U.N. 
agencies and NGOs plan to distribute relief supplies in the coming 
days. 
 
¶5. Kassala State:  According to the U.N. Resident Coordinator's 
Office, flooding of the Gash River has affected more than 16,345 
households in Kassala State.  The most-affected area is currently 
New Halfa, west of Kassala town, where 3,090 households have 
experienced flood-related damage.  NGOs and U.N. agencies have 
mobilized to provide sufficient support to affected areas, including 
providing assistance by boat to the town of Aroma.  (Note:  Flood 
waters have receded from Aroma.  An evacuation of the entire town 
had been considered earlier in July.  End note.) 
 
¶6. Blue Nile, Red Sea, Gezira, and Sennar States:  U.N. agencies, 
 
KHARTOUM 00001124  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
NGOs, and local officials report varying levels of damage in Blue 
Nile State from flooding of the Blue Nile River.  According to 
information compiled by the U.N. Resident Coordinator's Office, 562 
households have been affected; however, local officials informed the 
U.N. World Health Organization that 2,265 households were affected. 
While various sources anecdotally report that flooding has affected 
Red Sea, Gezira, and Sennar states, to date no information is 
available on these areas. 
 
¶7. White Nile State:  According to USAID partner Adventist 
Development and Relief Agency (ADRA), heavy rains and flooding since 
June 30 have affected more than 2,500 households in Kosti, Rabak, 
and Tendelti towns in White Nile State.  On July 2, ADRA, Fellowship 
for African Relief, the GNU HAC, and SRC conducted a house-to-house 
assessment.  Nearly 1,600 houses were destroyed, and nearly 1,000 
additional homes sustained damage.  Three bridges collapsed in 
Rabak.  Stagnant water in homes, yards, and roads remains a pressing 
issue.  ADRA and FAR are distributing water containers, shelter 
materials, sleeping mats, and kitchen supplies to more than 850 
households.  UNICEF provided 1,000 mosquito nets and enough soap for 
1,000 families to the White Nile State Ministry of Health.  The GNU 
HAC reportedly is providing 9 MT of food.  Other humanitarian needs 
include mosquito nets, plastic sheeting, digging tools for stagnant 
water drainage, sprayers and insecticides, and essential drugs. 
 
--------------------- 
Humanitarian Response 
--------------------- 
 
¶8. The U.N. Resident Coordinator's Office is coordinating the flood 
response for U.N. agencies and NGOs.  In accessible areas, relief 
agencies have mobilized to provide supplies such as water 
containers, blankets, and plastic sheeting, in addition to emergency 
food rations.  In response to flooding countrywide, the U.N. plans 
to provide USD 1.5 million from the Common Humanitarian Fund for 
Sudan and an unspecified amount from the global U.N. Central 
Emergency Response Fund, in addition to releasing an emergency 
appeal for flood response. 
 
------------ 
GNU Response 
------------ 
 
¶9. The GNU HAC is coordinating the national response.  State-level 
emergency committees are coordinating flood response efforts, 
including dissemination of information on affected areas, monitoring 
water levels, draining water, and providing relief supplies to 
affected populations.  The GNU has estimated that as many as 1 
million people could be affected by flooding in the coming weeks. 
(Comment:  USAID staff note that the estimate does not appear to be 
based on assessments or other reliable data.  UNJLC has already 
distributed supplies to 111,000 people countrywide, and that number 
is expected to climb to 185,000 after distributions in El Obeid in 
the coming days.  End comment.) 
 
¶10.  A recent Sudan Vision article reported that communities at risk 
were not receiving or heeding flood early-warning messages from the 
government.  However, the GNU is communicating early-warning 
information about water levels and rainfall forecasts to the 
humanitarian community via a newsletter.  In recent years, 
USAID/OFDA has helped strengthen Sudanese early-warning efforts.  In 
2004 USAID/OFDA deployed a hydrometeorological hazard advisor to 
evaluate flood mitigation options in the Gash River Basin.  In 2005 
USAID/OFDA held a workshop with the U.N. Educational, Scientific, 
and Cultural Organization and the University of Khartoum Engineering 
Department to train water resource managers. 
 
------------ 
USG Response 
------------ 
 
¶11. Charge d'Affaires Alberto Fernandez has determined that the 
flooding in Sudan meets the necessary criteria for the USD 300,000 
to be released: 1) A flood disaster exists in Sudan; 2) The GNU does 
not object to USG providing emergency assistance; and 3) Such 
assistance is in the USG's interest. 
 
¶12. Embassy Khartoum, USAID/Sudan, and USAID/OFDA are coordinating 
an emergency response.  USAID/OFDA has a team on the ground in 
Khartoum overseeing daily coordination and communication of the 
evolving situation, including attending GNU meetings, conducting 
assessments, and coordinating flood response activities with U.N. 
 
KHARTOUM 00001124  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
agencies and NGOs. 
 
¶13. In consultation with the USAID/OFDA team in Khartoum, post 
understands that USAID/OFDA intends to provide UNICEF with USD 
300,000 for the provision of emergency relief supplies.  Post 
concurs with this decision and does not request the USD 50,000 in 
Ambassador's Authority funds at this time.  The grant to UNICEF will 
be processed by USAID/Washington. 
 
¶14. USAID/OFDA plans to assess damage in Khartoum IDP camps, 
Northern Kordofan State, and Kassala State in the coming weeks. 
USAID/Sudan will continue to monitor the situation as the rainy 
season progresses.
