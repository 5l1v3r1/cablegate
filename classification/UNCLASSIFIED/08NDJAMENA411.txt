TWENTY-TWO (22) RFC OFFICERS RETURN TO NDJAMENA 
--------------------- ------------------------- 
 
¶1. FOLLOWING SIGNATURE ON AUGUST 18, 2008 OF A PROTOCOL ANNEXED TO 
THE SIRTE ACCORD, 22 OFFICERS FROM THE REBEL "RASSEMBLEMENT DES 
FORCES DE CHANGEMENT" (RFC) ARRIVED IN NDJAMENA TO BEGIN 
REINTEGRATION INTO GOVERNMENT SERVICE. THE DELEGATION WAS LED BY 
COLONEL ISAACK BACHAR TOGOU, RFC'S DEFENSE COMMISSIONER. HE DECLARED 
THAT OTHER SOLDIERS OF HIS GROUP WITH 80 VEHICLES ARE CAMPED NEAR 
IRIBA, WAITING FOR THEIR REINTEGRATION IN THE CHADIAN NATIONAL ARMY 
OR CIVIL SERVICE.  COMMENTING ON THE NOW EX-REBELS, MR. ADBDERAHMAN 
MOUSSA, NATIONAL MEDIATOR, SAID THAT THEIR WISE DECISION SHOULD 
INSPIRE OTHER CHADIANS WHO ARE STILL IN REBELLION. HE HOPED THAT 
OTHER GROUPS WOULD IMITATE THE RFC IN DAYS TO COME. COLONEL TOGOU 
WAS ONE OF THE REBEL CHIEFS CONVICTED BY THE GOC RECENTLY AND 
SENTENCED; TOGOU'S REHABILITATION INDICATES THAT THE GOC IS FLEXIBLE 
IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE CPDC REACTS TO THE INVESTIGATION REPORT 
------------------- ----------------------- 
 
¶2. IN A PRESS RELEASE DATED SEPTEMBER 4, 2008, MEMBERS OF THE 
"COORDINATION DES PARTIES POUR LA DEFENSE DE LA CONSTITUTION" (CPDC 
- COORDINATION OF POLITICAL PARTIES FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE 
CONSITUTION) DEPLORED THE FACT THAT THE INVESTIGATIVE REPORT ON THE 
FEBRUARY EVENTS FAILED TO SHED LIGHT ON THE FATE OF THE 
COORDINATION'S SPOKESPERSON, MR. IBNI OUMAR MAHAMAT SALEH. THE CPDC 
OBSERVED THAT IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT MR. SALEH WAS KIDNAPPED BY 
MILITARY OFFICERS ACTING UNDER THE DIRECT ORDERS OF PRESIDENT DEBY. 
THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO THE CPDC, DEBY AND THE "POWERS THAT TRAIN 
THE CHADIAN ARMY AND PROVIDE ARMS AND AMMUNITIONS USED TO PERPETRATE 
BIG-SCALE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS" (I.E. THE FRENCH) SHOULD TELL THE 
TRUTH ABOUT MR. SALEH'S FATE.  THE CPDC APPEALED TO FRENCH PRESIDENT 
NICOLAS SARKOZY TO INTERVENE IN ORDER TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH.  THEY 
VOWED TO UNDERTAKE JUDICIAL ACTION, INCLUDING BEFORE INTERNATIONAL 
COURTS TO INSURE THAT THESE ACTS DO NOT REMAIN UNPUNISHED.

CHAD ENGAGES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM 
-------------------- ---------------------- 
 
¶3. THE CHADIAN MINISTRY OF JUSTICE HELD A 5-DAY SEMINAR ON THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAWS AND UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTIONS ON TERRORISM.  THE SEMINAR WAS ORGANIZED IN 
COLLABORATION WITH THE UNITED NATIONS DRUG AND CRIME OFFICE (UNDCO). 
IT WAS OPENED ON SEPTEMBER 8 BY MINISTER OF JUSTICE, MR ALINGUE 
BAWOYEU.  SEMINAR PARTICIPANTS REVIEWED CHADIAN LAWS IN CONJUCTION 
WITH INTERNATIONAL LAWS ON TERRORISM. THEY EXPLORED U.N. SECURITY 
COUNCIL'S RESOLUTIONS ON AL-QAIDA, THE TALIBAN, ASSOCIATED 
INDIVIVUALS AND INSTITUTIONS. IN HIS OPENING REMARKS, MR. ALINGUE 
DECLARED THAT THE AIM OF THE SEMINAR WAS TO "EXAMINE EXTRADITION AND 
JUDICIAL COOPERATION MECHANISMS, EITHER BETWEEN COURTS OR THROUGH 
INTERPOL."  HE PROMISED THAT ADDITIONAL TRAINING SESSIONS WOULD BE 
ORGANIZED FOR CHADIAN MAGISTRATES AND MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIAL 
POLICE.

WORLD BANK PULLS OUT OF CHAD-CAMEROON PIPELINE PROJECT 
----------------------- ------------------------------- 
 
¶4. THE WORLD BANK ANNOUNCED ON SEPTEMBER 9 THE WITHDRAWAL OF 
PARTICIPATION IN FINANCING THE CHAD-CAMEROON PIPELINE BECAUSE THE 
CHADIAN GOVERNEMENT FAILED TO USE OIL REVENUES FOR POVERTY 
REDUCTION. THE BANK REPORTED THAT THE CHADIAN GOVERNMENT FULLY 
PREPAID THE PIPELINE-RELATED LOAN AS OF SEPTEMBER 5, 2008. THE 
WITHDRAWAL OF THE BANK FOLLOWS YEARS OF TENSION FOLLOWING  WITH THE 
INITIAL AGREEMENT IN 2001 TO FINANCE CHAD'S AND CAMEROON'S 
PARTICIPATION IN THE TWO PIPELINE COMPANIES, A SMALL PART OF THE 
OVERALL INANCING OF THE PIPELINE PROJECT. NONETHELESS, THE BANK 
OFFERED TO CONTINUE COOPERATION WITH CHAD "IF THE GOVERNMENT OF CHAD 
WISHES TO FOCUS ITS ENERGIES ON A PROGRAM TO SUPPORT INCLUSIVE 
DEVELOPMENT TO OVERCOME POVERTY, ASSIST DISPLACED PEOPLE, IMPROVE 
GOVERNANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS TO ACHIEVE RESULTS." IN REACTION TO 
THIS DECISION, THE CHADIAN MINISTER OF ECONOMY AND PLANNING, MR. 
MATTAR BREME, DECLARED THAT "CHAD HAS NOT, IN ANY WAY, DECIDED TO 
CUT RELATIONS [WITH THE WB]. THERE HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTANDINGS 
REGARDING THE OIL REVENUE LAW... OUR PARTNERS HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY 
WILL NO LONGER PARTICIPATE IN THAT AGREEMENT. WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO 
 
NDJAMENA 00000411  002 OF 002 
 
 
CONTINUE COOPERATION OUTSIDE THE OIL SECTOR."

OXFAM ACCUSES UN-EU FORCES OF FAILING TO PROTECT CIVILIANS 
--------------------------- ------------------------------ 
 
¶5. OXFAM CHARGED THAT THE UN-EU PEACEKEEPING MISSION IN CHAD IS 
UNABLE TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY'S CIVILIANS DUE TO A COMBINATION OF 
DELAYS, BUREAUCRATIC HURDLES, AND LACK OF COORDINATION. THE 
PEACEKEEPING MISSION ESTABLISHED BY THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL IN 
SEPTEMBER 2007 COMPRISES A UN POLICE-GOVERNANCE-HUMAN RIGHTS 
COMPONENT, MINURCAT (IN CHARGE OF SECURITY INSIDE THE CAMPS), AND 
THE EU MILITARY FORCE, EUFOR (IN CHARGE OF GENERAL SECURITY). OXFAM 
WAS PARTICULARLY CRITICAL OF MINURCAT, NOTING THAT JUST 320 CHADIAN 
POLICE HAVE BEEN TRAINED SO FAR.  "THIS LAW AND ORDER VACUUM HAS 
RESULTED IN MUSHROOMING ATTACKS ON AID WORKERS AND CIVILIANS AS 
BANDITS REALISE THEY CAN ROB AND KILL WITHOUT FEAR," OXFAM SAID. 
OXFAM'S HUMANITARIAN POLICY ADVISER, ELISE FORD, SPEAKING FROM 
BRUSSELS, URGED THE E.U. TO "TAKE GREATER RESOPONSIBILITY FOR THE 
SUCCESS OF THE WHOLE, NOT JUST EUFOR."
