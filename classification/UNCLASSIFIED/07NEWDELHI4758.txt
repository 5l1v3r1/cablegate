¶1.  (U) Below is a compilation of political highlights from 
Embassy New Delhi for October 23-26, 2007 that did not 
feature in our other reporting, including: 
 
-- India, China and Russia Jointly Oppose Further Burma 
Sanctions 
-- Bhutanese Election Dates Announced 
 
India, China and Russia Jointly Oppose Further Burma Sanctions 
------- 
 
¶2.  (U) The Foreign Ministers of the three neighbors met 
jointly October 24 in Harbin, China for their third so-called 
"troika" meeting.  In contrast to the last troika which 
produced no significant strategic results, all three used 
this occasion to publicly criticize the initiative to impose 
further UN sanctions against Burma.  External Affairs 
Minister Pranab Mukherjee confirmed to reporters that the 
Burma issue had featured prominently during the trilateral 
meeting and voiced support for UN Special Envoy Gambari,s 
dialogue with Burma, adding "there should not be any 
sanctions (against Burma) at this stage."  Chinese FM Yang 
Jiechi, speaking to media, echoed Mukherjee's support for UN 
dialogue and claimed that the situation in Burma was "calming 
down" and that "the countries concerned (the US and other 
like-minded countries) should play a helping role rather than 
applying sanctions."  The three repeated February,s 
statement of zero tolerance for terrorism and reassurance 
that the trilateral is not directed against any other nation. 
 Russian FM Sergei Lavrov added explicitly that they were not 
setting up any military alliance. 
 
Bhutanese Election Dates Announced 
------- 
 
¶3.  (U) As Bhutan embarks on the road to democracy, the Chief 
Election Commissioner, Kunzang Wangdi, announced firm dates 
for Bhutan,s inaugural national elections with polling for 
the nation,s upper-house, the National Council, scheduled 
for December 26.  Candidates will be competing for twenty of 
the twenty-five seats in the National Council, with the 
remaining five members appointed by the King of Bhutan. 
Candidates have until November 26 to file for nomination and 
are constrained to a twenty-five-day campaigning window, from 
November 30 until December 24. Elections for the 47 seats in 
the Bhutanese lower house, the National Assembly, are slated 
to take place in two rounds in February and March of 2008. 
We plan to send election observers to Bhutan in December and 
early 2008.
