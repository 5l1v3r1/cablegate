Al Quds leads with, "Hammad:  Dialogue mustsucceed in order for new 
elections to proceed." Qoting Palestinian Authority (PA) 
Presidential poitical advisor Nimer Hammad, the story notes that 
the advisor calls upon all Palestinian factions t engage in the 
internal Palestinian talks to be eld in Cairo, "with goodwill." 
Hammad also calls or no further discussion regarding reports aboutPA President 
Abbas running for office in future elctions, stating 
that the issue is not under discssion.  Al Ayyam leads with, "Hamas 
delegation t Cairo presents four vetoes of proposals for a 
tehnocrat government and new elections." The paper qotes Hamas 
objections to establishing a technocrt government, conducting 
reform to security in Gza (not the West Bank), disregarding 
previous elction results and "dealing with Gaza separately." 
The lead story in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida quotes Palestnian Authority 
(PA) President Abbas confirming tat the PA, "will adhere to 
whatever Arabs decideregarding [Palestinian] national unity.  Those 
wo do not accept [the decision], will have to bear the 
consequences."  Abbas' statements came during is visit to India, 
where he also commented that,"peace negotiations with Israel shall 
continue twards a comprehensive agreement that does not leav out 
any issues ... [however], this year will, inevitably, end without a 
peace agreement." 
Al Quds' front page reports that Middle East Quartet Envoy Tony 
Blair will arrive in Egypt on October 9 to prepare for a meeting of 
representatives from the Quartet, Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiating teams. 
The world economic crisis is featured on all front pages. Running 
wire stories, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs a headline, "black day in 
world markets," while Al Ayyam's headline notes that the crisis is 
"rocking Wall Street... U.S. calls for unified global action." Al 
Quds runs a large, highlighted box with four wire stories from 
Paris, New York, London, and Tel Aviv, describing the impact of the 
crisis in each capital. 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al Ayyam report on their front pages that 
Hamas "legislators" decided in a "parliament session" that 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas' term will end on January 8, 
Â¶2009.  They also called upon Abbas to task the elections committee 
with preparing for new elections.  Hamas "Legislative Council Deputy 
Speaker" Ahmad Bahr chaired the session and is quoted calling for 
national reconciliation, while another Hamas official Faraj Al 
Ghoul, is quoted stating that the Palestinian Legislative Council's 
deputy speaker will take office after Abbas. 
Al Quds' publishes the results of a public opinion poll conducted by 
Near East Consulting on its front page.  The poll shows that 63% of 
Palestinians want Palestinian Authority President Abbas to continue 
in office, while 37% do not.  The poll also revealed that 88% of 
Fatah supporters want Abbas to stay in office. 
Al Quds notes in a prominent front page story that Palestinian 
Authority (PA) Prime Minister Fayyad announced that the PA will pay 
next month's salaries to public employees.  Fayyad comments came 
after the PA's weekly cabinet meeting.  He also stated that he 
expected the financial situation of the PA to be better next year. 
Al Ayyam's front page highlights comments from the meeting offering 
the ministers' support for the "steadfastness" of the old city of 
Hebron and calling for a lifting of Israeli barriers and 
check-points. Al-Hayat Al-Jadida highlights news that the cabinet 
has approved funding for cultural activities in Jerusalem to 
celebrate the city as the "Arab cultural capital of 2009," which is 
part of a UNESCO- affiliated program.
