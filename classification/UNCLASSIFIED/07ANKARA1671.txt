REF: SECSTATE 57064 
 
¶1. Per reftel request, we met with Guvenli Yasam (Full name: 
Guvenli Yasam Is Guvenligi San. Tic. Ltd. Sti.) Founder/Owner 
Hasan Deliduman in late May regarding license number 
05-050042160.  Deliduman confirmed all details of the 
contract, including the order for 250 Camelbaks (Model: 
Camelbak ChemBio Reservoir 4.0) and the end user, the 
Egyptian military. 
 
¶2. Guvenli Yasam is a small business run out of an apartment 
building in a neighborhood with several small defense 
contractors.  Deliduman, who stated that he founded Guvenli 
Yasam in 1985, has one employee at the main office address in 
the Mebusevleri section of Ankara.  This company specializes 
in producing police and anti-riot equipment, and has a 
production facility in the Ostem neighborhood, an industrial 
area west of Ankara.  Deliduman said that he began his 
business in the 1980's with the production of helmets and 
associate parts, but that in the 1990's his firm began more 
advanced production of protective equipment, particularly for 
police forces, in the domestic and global market.  He 
remarked that his company has been doing business with 
Egyptian police and military forces for almost a decade now, 
and received an award from the Egyptian Ministry of Defense 
(MOD) for its products, which he showed us.  He claimed that 
his company has sold over 30,000 helmets and 20,000 batons to 
Egypt.  Deliduman said that Guvenli Yasam has also sold 
equipment to police forces in the U.S., U.K., Israel, 
Belgium, and several African countries.  When asked about his 
future corporate plans, Deliduman said future projects could 
include non-police equipment such as field kitchens. 
Deliduman provided a company brochure, his business card, and 
contact information. 
 
¶3. Deliduman claimed that this current agreement (license 
number 05-050042160) is behind schedule due to delays on the 
part of the American firm (Tradeways Ltd. in Annapolis, 
Maryland).  Tradeways, said Deliduman, in turn claims that 
Defense Department delays are holding up the export of the 
Camelbaks to Guvenli Yasam.  He requested post's assistance 
to determine the cause of the delay.  According to Deliduman, 
none of the 250 Camelbaks has arrived in Turkey yet. 
 
¶4.  Based on the meeting with Deliduman, who answered all of 
our questions, we believe that Guvenli Yasam is a legitimate 
company and that the end user of the Camelbaks is the 
Egyptian military.
