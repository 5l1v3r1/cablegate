Chinese goods.

SIPDIS 
 
-- The Spokesman criticized Australia for allowing a visit by 
the Dalai Lama, said he would research questions about 
China-Iran cooperation on a strategic oil reserve and 
dismissed speculation about the coming 17th Party Congress.

in the next week. 
 
Economic Issues Should Not Be Politicized 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the June 12 regular MFA press briefing, spokesman Qin 
Gang argued that economic issues must not be politicized, 
while emphasizing the win-win relationship of U.S.-China 
trade in response to a question on possible American 
legislation that would raise tariffs on Chinese goods.  If 
such legislation is announced, "relevant authorities in China 
will have their responses," Qin said.  He touted the 
consensus reached and successes achieved at the recent SED in 
Washington. 
 
4th Strategic Dialogue an "Important Platform" 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3. EVFM Dai will meet Deputy Secretary Negroponte for the 4th 
Strategic Dialogue June 20-21 in Washington, Qin announced. 
During the Dialogue, which Qin called an important platform 
for communication between the two sides, delegations will 
exchange views on the bilateral relationship and other 
regional and international issues. 
 
Six-Party Talks; Possible A/S Hill Visit 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Asked if A/S Hill had plans to return to Beijing in the 
near future and for any news on efforts to solve the BDA 
issue and restart the Six-Party Talks, Qin reiterated China's 
hope that the relevant parties can solve the relevant issues 
at and early date so as to implement the initial actions and 
push forward with the Talks.  On efforts to solve the BDA 
issues, the spokesman said he had no specifics and that 
further consultation was required. 
 
Africa Development at the G-8, Darfur 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. Asked about a G-8 session on African development, Qin 
emphasized China's efforts in poverty relief and development 
in Africa, but did not answer whether China had attended.  He 
noted President Hu's elaboration of China's ideas on African 
development and narrowing the north-south wealth gap at the 
summit.  On the topic of Darfur, Qin reiterated China's call 
for the issue to be solved through dialogue and consultation 
and praised the joint peace-keeping efforts carried out so 
far.  Qin noted Special Envoy Liu Guijin's efforts to resolve 
the Darfur issue when asked if Liu would meet American 
Special Envoy Natsios soon. 
 
Criticism of Child Labor, State Secrets Laws 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. China protects the rights of workers, has ratified four of 
the eight International Labor Organization's conventions and 
 
BEIJING 00003948  002 OF 002 
 
 
is studying the other four, Qin said responding to questions 
about an NGO report that China uses child labor to produce 
2008 Olympics-related products.  China requires manufacturers 
of Olympics products to strictly follow all labor and IPR 
regulations, he added.  The Beijing Organizing Committee for 
the Olympic Games is investigating these reports. 
 
¶7. The Chinese Government protects the freedom of speech, 
governs in accordance with law and puts the people first 
while working to increase transparency and access to 
information, said Qin responding to a Human Rights in China 
report that state secrets laws are restrictive.  No country 
has complete transparency and the purpose of these critical 
reports is difficult to understand, he added. 
 
Dalai Lama Australia Visit 
-------------------------- 
 
¶8. The Dalai Lama is a "splittist" in exile, not a simple 
religious leader and China is against any country providing a 
platform for his activities, stated Qin commenting on the 
Dalai Lama's planned visit to Australia.  China has made 
representations to Australia expressing its concerns and 
dissatisfaction and hopes Australia will recognize the nature 
of the issue for the development of bilateral relations. 
 
Hope for EU to Grant China Market Economy Status 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶9. Qin expressed hope that the EU can recognize China's 
market economy status, noting China's accession into the WTO 
and the fact that 56 countries to date have granted China 
such status.  Asked about an EU-China Joint Trade Ministerial 
Meeting and China's hopes for EU-China cooperation, the 
spokesman emphasized the current "good momentum" in EU-China 
relations but stressed the desire for raising cooperation to 
a high level in a broader range of issues.  He referred a 
question on dialogue between the EU and Chinese Trade 
Ministers to the Ministry of Commerce. 
 
Iran-China Strategic Oil Reserve? 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶10. The MFA is currently checking on reports that Iran and 
China are cooperating to establish a strategic oil reserve 
and cannot confirm such reports. 
 
VP Zeng to Retire at 17th Party Congress? 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶11. The spokesman asked the media not to make groundless 
guesses regarding matters of the 17th Party Congress in 
response to a question on whether VP Zeng would retire at the 
upcoming Congress. 
 
Visits: Palestine FM, UNGA President 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶12. At the invitation of FM Yang the Palestinian Authority FM 
will visit China June 16 to discuss issues of mutual 
interest.  China hopes the visit will further develop 
friendly bilateral ties.  China welcomes the international 
community's efforts and will continue to promote the Middle 
East peace process and a proper solution to the Palestine 
issue based on UN resolutions and the peaceful existence of 
two states, he said. 
 
¶13. UN General Assembly President Haya will visit June 19-24 
and will attend the 10th meeting of the International 
Association of Economic and Social Councils and Similar 
Institutions (IAESCSI).
