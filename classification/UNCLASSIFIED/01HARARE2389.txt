SHADRECK CHIPANGA CALLED, ON AUGUST 8, FOR THE DECLARATION OF 
"MARTIAL LAW" IN ZIMBABWE.  THE AUGUST 9 EDITIONS OF THE 
GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY 'THE HERALD' AND THE INDEPENDENT DAILY 
'THE DAILY NEWS' COVERED THE LEGISLATOR'S STATEMENT IN PARLIAMENT 
WHICH COMES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE APPROVAL OF THE ZIMBABWE

¶2. UNDER HEADLINE "DECLARE STATE OF EMERGENCY IF U. S. CONGRESS 
PASSES BILL - CHIPANGA," THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED DAILY 'THE 
HERALD' REPORTS: 
 
"A ZANU-PF BACKBENCHER YESTERDAY (AUGUST 8) CALLED UPON PARLIAMENT 
TO SUPPORT THE DECLARATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE COUNTRY 
IF THE U. S. CONGRESS PASSES THE CONTROVERSIAL ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY 
(AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY) BILL.  MAKONI EAST MP (MEMBER OF 
PARLIAMENT) SHADRECK CHIPANGA SAID THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY THE 
COUNTRY WOULD PROTECT ITSELF.  'I WANT TO APPEAL TO THIS HOUSE 
THAT IF AND WHEN THIS BILL IS PASSED, WE SHOULD AS A NATION MAKE 
SURE THAT A STATE OF EMERGENCY IS DECLARED.  THE STATE OF 
EMERGENCY IS THE ONLY WEAPON IN OUR KIT.  THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT 
NO BY-ELECTION AND NO ELECTION IS HELD IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT NO 
ONE, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE IN THE HABIT OF GLOBETROTTING 
ADVOCATING FOR SANCTIONS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. 
. .HOWEVER, BULIMAMANGWE SOUTH MP MR. EDWARD MKHOSI (MOVEMENT FOR 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE (MDC) SAID A STATE OF EMERGENCY WOULD 'DEVOUR' 
THE COUNTRY. . .'THE STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT IS BEING ADVOCATED 
FOR IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE I HAVE EXPERIENCED IT.  THAT WAS THE MOST 
DANGEROUS THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO THIS COUNTRY.  YOU HAVE

BROTHER KILLING BROTHER AND IT WAS A HORRENDOUS SITUATION.'  HE 
SAID THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD RUN ELECTIONS AND WORK WITH THE 
OPPOSITION 'IN A PROPER WAY. . . .'" 
 
¶3. UNDER HEADLINE "EX-CIO BOSS URGES GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE STATE OF 
EMERGENCY," THE INDEPENDENT DAILY 'THE DAILY NEWS' REPORTS: 
 
"SHADRECK CHIPANGA, THE ZANU PF MP FOR MAKONI EAST, SAID YESTERDAY 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD IMPOSE A STATE OF EMERGENCY ONCE THE UNITED 
STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSES THE ZIMBABWE DEMOCRACY AND 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY BILL.  BUT AN MDC MP FROM MATABELELAND SAID THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY WOULD BE AS HORRENDOUS AS 
THEY WERE IN THE 1983-87 PERIOD.  CHIPANGA, A FORMER CENTRAL 
INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION DIRECTOR-GENERAL, SAID A STATE OF 
EMERGENCY SHOULD BE DECLARED ONCE THE BILL PASSES THROUGH THE U. 
¶S. CONGRESS AND EVENTUALLY SIGNED INTO LAW BY PRESIDENT GEORGE W. 
BUSH. . . ."

DECLARING A STATE OF EMERGENCY IF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY GOES

SAID THE APPROVAL BY THE U. S. SENATE LAST WEEK OF THE ZIMBABWE

ZANU PF PARTY THIS WEEK SAID THE 'LAW OF SURVIVAL' WOULD TAKE OVER 
IF SANCTIONS ARE IMPOSED ON ZIMBABWE.  'WE WILL BE LEFT WITH NO 
CHOICE BUT TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY IF WE ARE UNDER 
SANCTIONS . . .WITH THE WAY THE SITUATION IS DEVELOPING, THAT 
CANNOT BE RULED OUT.  THE LAW OF SURVIVAL WILL TAKE OVER,' THE 
MINISTER SAID, PREFERRING NOT TO BE NAMED. . . .'"
