On January 20, conservative, independent "La Tercera" (circ. 
101,000) ran an editorial entitled "The Latin American Left's New 
Model." 
 
"With the inauguration of the new president of Ecuador last Monday, 
the cycle of government changes in Latin America, which links to the 
leftist populist axis led by Venezuela, has been closed....  All of 
the governments in the leftist axis have been democratically 
elected....  but one cannot deny that their political platforms are 
the opposite of what has been done by Chile and most of the 
economically successful countries worldwide, e.g., [successful 
countries] have opened their borders and markets to globalization, 
liberalized their economies, restricted the State's role, and forged 
a good relationship with the United States. Chile's challenge is to 
maintain its ties and good relations with all in the region while 
not deviating from its economic and political strategy..."
