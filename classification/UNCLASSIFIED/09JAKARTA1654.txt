¶1.  The following information is current as of Saturday, October 3, 
1100 hours, local time. 
 
CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND 
 
¶2.  Search and rescue operations continue.  There are reports that 
approximately 60 people may be trapped in the Ambachang hotel, which 
caters to foreigners.  Major roads are reportedly open, although 
travel is extremely slow.  The telecommunications are improving and 
major hotels have power in the evening so cell phones are getting 
recharged.  Fuel remains in limited supply and there are reports of 
widespread hoarding.  The Padang mayor has stated that Padang has a 
twelve day supply of fuel, an estimate which experts question. 
Vehicles and drivers are difficult to find because of the fuel 
shortage as well as the fact that international relief teams are 
hiring them.  To date, all of the search and rescue and relief 
efforts have focused on Padang.  According to reliable sources the 
destruction in the outlying areas is more severe than what has 
occurred in Padang.  The local government announced that banks in 
Padang will re-open on Monday, October 5. 
 
DEATHS AND INJURIES 
 
¶3.  The official figure for deaths has been revised upwards to "more 
than 460."  According to the Indonesian press 275 people have been 
severely injured and more than 2,500 have been slightly injured. 
There are credible reports of victims trapped under the rubble, so 
the local government has requested "Diamond Knives," equipment to 
cut through the collapsed buildings.  Posts points out that these 
figures/reports are from Padang city only, because as noted above, 
the GOI has not yet focused on outlying areas. 
 
CONSULAR MATTERS 
 
¶4. All Amcits who we are aware of, either thru registration with us 
or reported as being in Padang and Bengkulu districts, are accounted 
for.  In some instances our Padang team went to their last known 
address and neighbors report that the Amcits are no longer living 
there or the house is gone (not by earthquake but by redevelopment). 
 In other instances we had direct contact with the Amcits.  No 
Amcits are at local morgues or hospitals.  We continue to learn of 
Amcits who may be in Padang, or were in Padang but now in Jakarta, 
and either we or they notify interested parties in the U.S.  None 
have needed further consular or financial assistance.  One Amcit 
long term resident of Padang was reported to us by his U.S. 
relatives as being ill prior to the earthquake; we are following up. 
 
 
¶5.  The main remaining consular concern is likely Westerner 
casualties at the Ambacang Hotel.  An Amcit guest who escaped states 
that the swimming pool was full of Westerners swimming and the "pool 
disappeared under one part of the hotel that collapsed over it."  He 
does not know of other Amcit guests.  The hotel's guest register and 
office is buried under rubble and it may be several days before the 
extent of casualties is known.  We have received no inquiries from 
interested parties regarding Amcit guests of the Ambacang Hotel. 
Our German consular counterparts report several dozen unaccounted 
for German citizens in the Padang area.  A Conoff will be at the 
Padang Hotel to Tuesday, 6 Oct, and can stay longer if needed. 
Otherwise our consular role will diminish rapidly.  Jakarta Conoff 
Paul Howard is available through the embassy duty officer as needed 
over the weekend. 
 
USG EFFORTS 
 
¶6.  In response to request from GOI for assistance, U.S. Pacific 
Command is moving assets, including personnel to conduct assessments 
and provide a timely response.  U.S. Pacific Command has sent a 
humanitarian assistance survey team (HAST)composed of personnel from 
various units within USPACOM to assess the situation and provide 
aid. Additionally, USS DENVER, with embarked 31ST Marine 
Expeditionary Unit, has been ordered to sail in the vicinity of 
Padang and is expected to arrive by October 8.  An order has been 
executed to bring in HART-2 C17.  A 500 square meter field hospital, 
which can handle 300-400 patients per day for 4-5 days without 
additional supplies, will be set up. 
 
¶7.  USAID expects to award Mercy Corps a USD300,000 grant in the 
very near future, possibly today.  Mercy Corps will focus on 
providing shelter, water materials and medical supplies.  USAID 
expects that a commercial charter air may bring in medical supplies, 
generators and blankets on Monday, October 5 directly from Dubai to 
Padang.  An eleven person DARRT team will arrive in Jakarta Sunday, 
October 4 at 15:55 local time.  They will identify a self-sufficient

location in Padang. 
 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
 
¶8.  Post was told informally that the Russian Embassy is arranging 
to send in a 100-patient facility.  As reported reftel, teams from 
Japan, Korea, Singapore and others are on the move. 
 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS 
 
¶9.  Public Affairs has issued a press release on the White House 
readout of the President's Call to Indonesian President Yudhoyono. 
PAS is preparing a Special Edition of the Daily Round Up and 
partnering with APP Medan to produce Padang Quake update.  The local 
press continues to include in its coverage of the earthquake reports 
of international assistance.
