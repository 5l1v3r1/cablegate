In Today's Papers 
 
Turkey's Criticism of Israeli Operations in Gaza Complicates 
Bilateral Relations 
During yesterday's AKP party meeting, Prime Minister Erdogan warned 
the Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barack and Israeli Foreign 
Minister Tzipi Livni against trying to use the Gaza operations to 
shore up points in Israel's upcoming February elections. "Forget 
about your upcoming elections, because history will judge you for 
the black stain that is being left on humanity," Erdogan said. 
Islamist-oriented Zaman notes Erdogan said, "As the grandson of 
Ottomans who accepted Jews fleeing persecution in the past, Turkey 
has always supported the oppressed."  He also called on the world, 
"to extend support to Gaza." 
 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports Prime Minister Erdogan said 
during an AKP meeting that he "refuses to talk to Israeli Prime 
Minister Olmert on the telephone until the bloodshed in Gaza ends." 
Also during this meeting, Yeni Safak reports Erdogan "criticized 
Arab leaders who have stopped short of pushing for an end to the 
crisis in Gaza." 
 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni 
phoned Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan and called Erdogan's 
harsh public criticism of Israel, "unacceptable."  Hurriyet reports 
Livni said, "We understand the sensitivities in Turkey, but Israel 
is fighting against terrorism, just like Turkey."  In response, 
Babacan told Livni, "the bloodshed in Gaza is drawing worldwide 
attention," and "it is irresponsible to kill innocent civilians," so 
"our government cannot remain indifferent to public reactions." 
Babacan also stressed that Turkey has "called on Hamas to end their 
attacks."  In a related story, Islamist-oriented Zaman reports 
Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul said, "The Turkish government will not 
annul any defense deals with Israel," because "defense deals made 
with Israel serve Turkey's interests." 
 
Israel Bombs UN School in Gaza 
Turkish media are transfixed on the story of a UN-sponsored school 
in Gaza that was bombed by the Israelis.  Leftist-nationalist 
Cumhuriyet carries the headline, "A Massacre at a School Flying the 
UN Flag."  Liberal Radikal reports, "UN Schools Become the Graveyard 
of Women and Children."  Mainstream Vatan reports, "After Striking 
Mosques, Hospitals, and Ambulances, Israel's Latest Targets Are UN 
Schools."  Mainstream Hurriyet carries the headline, "43 Are Killed 
When a UN School, Used as a Civilian Shelter, is Bombed." 
Islamist-oriented Zaman reports, "Palestinians Are Attacked as They 
Seek Shelter from the UN."  Mainstream Sabah carries the headline, 
"Even a UN School Was Hit."  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports 
the UN school, "Was the Only Place They Could Find Shelter," and was 
struck as Palestinians "fled there in search of water and shelter." 
 
Columnists note Turkey is taking controversial steps in order to 
seek a peace deal.  Mehmet Tezkan wrote in mainstream Vatan, 
"Defending Palestinians does not mean acting like a sponsor of 
Hamas.  Turkish PM Erdogan is making a big mistake by taking sides 
with Hamas considering the fact that even some Arab nations treat 
Hamas as an organization that undermines peace."  Ali Bayramoglu 
wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "Unless Arabs are united, the 
Arab-Israel conflict will continue to shake the balances in the 
Middle East.  Alienating Hamas because of its Islamist roots is a 
big mistake.  The Western world and Arabs are digging their own 
ditches."  Erdal Safak wrote in mainstream Sabah, "PM Erdogan's 
foreign policy adviser (Ahmet Davutoglu) is in Damascus for the 
third time in a very short period.  Turkey's efforts involving Hamas 
are the right approach because Hamas will end up being a negotiation 
partner eventually since the Gaza operation by Israel will pave the 
way for Hamas's legitimization."  Fikret Bila wrote in mainstream 
Milliyet, "As confirmed by Government Spokesman, State Minister 
Cicek, Turkey wants to be very active in diplomatic efforts. 
Moreover Ankara is ready to join the International Monitoring Group 
 
ANKARA 00000023  002 OF 003 
 
 
to be stationed on the Egypt-Gaza border."  Murat Yetkin wrote in 
liberal-intellectual Radikal, "The Turkish government wants to use 
every diplomatic effort until the bitter end.  Diplomatic contacts 
cover not only the region, but also the U.S.  Turkish Foreign 
Minister Babacan has just left for New York.  Despite the angry 
remarks from the AKP and others, the AKP government did not pass a 
parliamentary resolution to denounce Israel at this point." 
 
Protestors Block Basketball Game between Turkey and Israel 
Milliyet, Cumhuriyet, Radikal:  A Euro Cup basketball game between 
Turk Telekom and Israel's Bnei Hasharon was cancelled due to intense 
audience protests against Israel's operations in Gaza.  Mainstream 
Milliyet reports that protestors sprayed tear gas at police and 
shattered the entrance doors of the sports saloon.  Because the 
audience's protest would not calm down, the Israeli team refused to 
play the game. 
 
Natural Gas Flow to Turkey Completely Cut Off from Western Line of 
Russia 
Hurriyet, Zaman, Sabah, Cumhuriyet, Vatan and others:  Mainstream 
Hurriyet reports that Energy Minister Hilmi Guler said Russia has 
completely halted the flow of natural gas from the western line of 
Russia to Turkey, but the Ministry has taken the necessary measures 
on the matter and "will not make people suffer."  Mainstream Vatan 
quotes Minister Guler as saying "Turkey has natural gas reserves for 
57 days."  Meanwhile, leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports that 
Turkey was "caught unprepared for natural gas shortage." 
 
Trial Begins for Taraf Editor 
Leftist Taraf reports that the Istanbul Besiktas District Prosecutor 
filed a case against the Taraf newspaper for "disclosing classified 
information related to the publication of the satellite images of 
the Aktutun attack," in which 17 soldiers were killed.  If found 
guilty, Taraf Editor Adnan Demir could be sentenced to three to five 
years in prison.  The first phase of the trial is expected to begin 
soon in Istanbul, the report adds. 
 
Diyarbakir Mayor Baydemir Criticizes PM's Peace Efforts 
Milliyet reports that at a local party meeting, Diyarbakir Mayor 
Osman Baydemir said "PM Erdogan is not sincere in his calls for 
peace in the Middle East.  While he demands a truce in Palestine, he 
also orders military strikes against Qandil."  Regarding TRT's 
Kurdish broadcasting Baydemir said "Our 20-year struggle for the 
recognition of the Kurdish language, culture and identity had 
produced results.  Someday, the name of our land (i.e. 'Kurdistan') 
also will be recognized." 
 
Investigation Continues into 22 Containers Transported from Iran 
Mainstream Sabah reports that a Custom's Official from Mersin port 
said that investigators did not find any radioactive materials in 
the 22 containers seized in Mersin last month.  However, since there 
are materials in them that may be used for the production of 
explosives, military experts have been called in to inspect the 
containers.  After the military inspection is completed, the 
authorities will decide whether to allow the containers to proceed 
to Venezuela.
