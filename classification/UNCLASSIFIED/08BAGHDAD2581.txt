SUBJECT: REAL ESTATE IN FALLUJAH 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Anbar ePRT reporting cable. 
 
¶2. (U) Summary:  Household wealth in Fallujah city is likely 
approaching U.S. levels based on appreciating real estate 
prices and low levels of debt. On the other hand, the 
commercial real estate market remains an eyesore in Fallujah 
as many of the buildings remain neglected from lack of 
capital investment as the citizens anxiously await GOI 
payment of the $87.45 million for 3,000 individual industrial 
compensation claims.  End Summary. 
 
¶3. (U) Real estate prices in Fallujah city are normalizing 
and are approaching parity with U.S. prices, based on 
conversations with Fadhil Mijbil Ali, Manager, Property 
Registry Directorate, Fallujah branch.  Dr. Fadhil is a 
lawyer by trade and holds a doctorate in Heritage.  Although 
he would not offer the average selling price of a home in 
Fallujah, he provided significant detail on selling prices 
per square meter.  Approximately 40 percent of the homes are 
sold at prices at or above IQD 250 million or approximately 
$208,000, especially in Hey Al Dubat and Al Muallimeen areas. 
 
¶4. (U) At IQD 250 million, a home buyer will typically 
purchase 250 square meters under the roof; resulting in a 
price of IQD 1 million per square meter or approximately $78 
per square foot.  This price holds constant for lower priced 
homes down to the range of 50 square meters, according to Dr. 
Fadhil.  For homes larger than 250 square meters, the price 
increases to roughly IQD 1.2 million per square meter or $94 
per square foot, reflecting a greater number of amenities. 
For example, 600 square meters of living space costs between 
IQD 700-750 million or approximately $600,000, according to 
Dr Fadhil.  The median price per square foot of floor space 
in new one-family houses in the U.S. sold for $85 in 2007, 
according to the National Association of Home Builders.  The 
median selling prices for existing and new homes in the 
United States were $213,800 and $230,900, respectively, in 
July 2008. 
 
¶5. (U) It is likely the wealth of the average Iraqi household 
is on par with the United States.  Many Iraqis completely own 
their homes.  This is due to many factors, to include 
religious as well as a poorly developed mortgage market.  In 
the United States, the average homeowners' equity - the 
market value minus mortgage balance - was 47.9% by the end of 
2007 according to the Federal Reserve - the lowest level 
since record keeping began in 1945.  Approximately 30 percent 
of American households own their homes without a mortgage. 
 
¶6. (U) The commercial real estate market is not the only 
eyesore in Fallujah as many of the buildings remain neglected 
from lack of capital investment as the citizens anxiously 
await GOI payment of the $87.45 million for 3,000 individual 
industrial compensation claims.
