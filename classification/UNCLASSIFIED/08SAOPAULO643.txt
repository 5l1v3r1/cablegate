Title - Obama's heterogeneous team will call for firm control 
 
Editorial in business-oriented Valor Economico (12-03) comments: "It 
seems Obama's cabinet choices are guided by experience, something 
the president [-elect] was accused of not having....His ministry 
resembles a national salvation cabinet filled with a wide range of 
opposing views.... Hillary Clinton...Jim Jones...and Republican 
Robert Gates...are to the right of the President-elect.... By making 
these choices, Obama signals he will move very carefully on the 
quicksand of the Iraq War and in Afghanistan.... The most evident 
change thus far is the adoption of a multilateral strategy by being 
opened to dialogue with rival nations and the pursuit of rebuilding 
the bridges with allies which were destroyed by George W. Bush.  The 
nomination of Susan Rice points firmly in that direction.... If 
[Obama] does not know exactly what he wants and if he does not exude 
a broad, firm and persuasive leadership, a cabinet made up of stars 
will turn into chaos."
