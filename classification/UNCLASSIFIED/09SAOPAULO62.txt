SUBJECT: Media Reaction Sao Paulo January 28 2009 
 
Media Reaction: New Administration's foreign policy 
 
Title- Obama's calculated gestures 
 
Main Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (1-28) states: 
"For now, the actual results of the dialogue matter less....than the 
pursuit of an approximation with a country as important as Brazil, 
implicit in the initiative of the call [from President Barack Obama 
to Lula]...The gesture from the American president of choosing an 
Arab TV station to give his first formal interview since he taking 
office...is also a statement of intention....if [Iran does not open 
its fists to Washington] the perspectives of peace in the Middle 
East will remain frozen: there is no hypothesis where Hamas 
renounces violence while the U.S. keeps treating Iran, its 
protector, as a pariah State." 
 
Media Reaction: Western Hemisphere; Bolivia; Sao Paulo 
 
Title- New Constitution keeps atmosphere of conflict in Bolivia 
 
Main editorial in business oriented Valor Economico (1-28) 
states:"....The main difficulties with the new regulations [in the 
new Constitution] are where property is concentrated in the hands of 
the State....and the rights that indigenous communities, which are 
Bolivia's majority, will enjoy....this [is a path that] ratifies the 
division in the country between indigenous communities and the rest, 
it weakens the State and makes it much more difficult to handle 
conflicts that were not pacified by the new legal mark 
[standards]."
