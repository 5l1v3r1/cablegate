SEVERSK BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AGENCY, SEVERSK, RUSSIA, 
LICENSE NO. D381152 
 
REFTEL: USDOC 09586 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Seversk Business Development Agency, Seversk, 
Russia. The company is listed on BIS license 
application D381152 as the ultimate consignee of one 
thermal imaging camera (flk-tiddft-20, fusion). This 
item is controlled for anti-terrorism, united nations, 
regional stability, nuclear non-proliferation and 
national security reasons under ECCN 6A003. The 
licensee is Fluke Corporation, 6920 Seaway Blvd., 
Everett, WA 98203. 
 
¶3. On February 12, 2008, Export Control Attache Peter 
Liston and LES Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with Seversk 
Business Development Agency, Tomsk, Russia. The export 
control team met with Sergey Kosyakov, Director and 
Ivan Savchuk, Director of Operations. 
 
¶4. The Seversk Business Development Agency (SBDA) is 
located in the closed city of Seversk, therefore the 
Moscow Export Control Team met with representatives of 
the SBDA at the Magistrate Hotel in Tomsk. 
 
¶5. The Seversk Business Development Agency was created 
in 2003 as a result of cooperation between the Closed 
Nuclear Cities Partnership Program (CNCP), the 
Siberian Chemical Kombinat (SCK) and the Closed City 
Administration of Seversk.  A feasibility study 
determined the market need for development of the SBDA 
in the closed city of Seversk.  The study identified 
appropriate services to be provided by a BDA in 
Seversk, given existing budgetary resources, and 
identify the best structure for such an agency.  The 
goal of the BDA is to promote a favorable climate for 
entrepreneurial activities and stimulate the formation 
and growth of new businesses and assist them to build 
up sales outside the closed cities and create civilian 
jobs, particularly for former nuclear weapons 
scientists, engineers and technicians from SCK. 
 
¶6.  The SBDA representatives advised the Moscow Export 
Control Team that FLUKE Thermal Imaging Camera has 
been used exclusively in the construction industry, 
identifying defects in buildings and schools.  SBDA 
presented two case studies recently completed using 
the thermal imaging camera that included printed 
images from the camera.  Copies were given to ECO 
Liston and are on file.  The SBDA stated that the 
fusion capabilities of the FLUKE model were one of the 
primary reasons their expert chose that camera. 
 
¶7.  The SBDA brought the FLUKE Thermal Imaging Camera 
to the meeting with the Moscow Export Control Team. 
Photos were taken of the camera and are available upon 
request.  The serial number of the camera was 
inspected and noted by ECO Liston as T155FT-0708059. 
 
¶8.  ECO Liston advised SBDA of all end-user 
restrictions that are inherent with the FLUKE Thermal 
Imaging Camera.  SBDA advised the Moscow Export 
Control Team that the camera, when not in use, is 
secured within a locked facility with access limited 
to those trained on its use and knowledgeable about 
the license restrictions. The SBDA stated that the 
camera was a considerable investment for the non- 
profit company and they have every intention on 
safeguarding it. 
 
¶9.  The SBDA is not involved in WMD or Missile 
Technology.  SBDA is a non-profit organization.  SBDA 
did ask the Moscow Export Control Team if they could 
use the camera to detect defects in government and 
military buildings and installations in the future 
should they bid on tenders to do so.  The ECO Moscow 
requests guidance in this regard. 
 
¶10. Recommendations: Post recommends Seversk Business 
Development Agency, Seversk, Russia as a reliable 
recipient of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
