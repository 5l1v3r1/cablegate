REF: A) STATE 1194 B) 12/13/07 EMAIL FROM AIT/TAIPEI

¶1.  AIT forwarded R/V Melville clearance application via 
cover letter to TECRO on December 13, 2007 (ref B). TECRO 
then forwarded the application to the National Science 
Council (NSC) for consideration.  On January 8 AIT received a 
formal written reply to the clearance request denying 
clearance for the vessel. 
 
¶2.  Begin informal translation of letter: 
 
--From: National Science Council 
 
--Topic:  Reply to AIT's Application for R/V Melville to 
Conduct Marine Scientific Research in Taiwan's Waters from 
3/11/2008 to 12/31/2008. 
 
--Explanation: 
 
--1.  According to Article 4 of the Measures for the Marine 
Science Research in the ROC Special Economic Maritime Area 
and Continental Shelf, individual foreigners or foreign 
researchers partnered with Taiwan citizens should submit 
their applications six months prior to the beginning date of 
the research.  The (Melville) application indicated its first 
entry date into Taiwan waters is March 2, 2008, and there it 
failed to meet the requirement. 
 
--2.  According to item 5.1 of the application, the project 
is applying for multiple entries into Taiwan's waters.  The 
current application, however, does not provide the itinerary 
for each of the cruise operations nor a list of crew members, 
as is required by Taiwan's regulations.  Please inform the 
U.S. side to supply the related information. The National 
Science Council will continue to process future applications 
provided that all the requirements are met.

End informal translation of letter. 
 
¶3.  In a January 9 telephone conversation, an NSC staffer 
reaffirmed that the NSC supports such research, but that 
there would not be enough time to obtain all of the 
interagency approvals before the March 2 entry date, due to 
the late receipt of application and the coming Chinese New 
Year holiday.  The NSC contact said she believed that the 
Melville researchers had already been advised of this issue 
by their local partner.  She also noted that the current 
application provided significantly less information than what 
was provided in a similar application last year.  The NSC 
staffer encouraged the Melville to reapply with a more 
complete application right away so that clearance could be 
arranged for a later date.
