"Massacre in Iraq" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo 
editorialized (6/5): "News that 24 civilian Iraqis were victims of 
summary execution in Haditha in November has shocked the public 
opinion the same way the disclosure of scenes of mistreatment in Abu 
Ghraib did.  On the same day of the massacre, it was reported that 
the accidental explosion of a bomb, left by insurgents, had caused 
most of the deaths. A military investigation, however, uncovered a 
different story. There was a bomb, and it killed an American 
soldier. Neighboring houses were then invaded by other soldiers.... 
It became clear that unarmed people were hit by shots on the head 
and in the chest. The military responsible for removing the bodies 
attempted to hide all traces of this event. There were women and 
children among the victims."
