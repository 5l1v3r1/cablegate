¶1.  (U) In response to reftels, Mission Germany plans to 
raise the plight of political prisoners in Cuba through a 
number of initiatives on May 21, the recently-announced Day 
of Solidarity with the Cuban People.  In addition to ongoing 
outreach to parliamentarians, Foreign Ministry and 
Chancellery officials on this issue, post plans to submit an 
Op-Ed under the Ambassador's by-line to one of the national 
and/or Berlin daily newspapers.  The Op-Ed will focus on on 
human rights in Cuba and specifically express USG concern and 
support for the 225 prisoners of conscience there.  Contacts 
at the Foreign Ministry have already expressed interest in 
the Day of Solidarity, and we will be following up on this. 
Consulates Munich, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, and Leipzig are 
also exploring ways they can leverage this day to reach out 
to the German public and official interlocutors. 
 
¶2.  (U) Mission Germany will be moving into its new embassy 
on May 23, handling a senior U.S. CODEL for the NATO 
parliamentary assembly, and POTUS pre-advance team that same 
week.  While this limits our capacity to host a more public 
event on May 21, we nonetheless will use what resources we do 
have for outreach at that time.  Additional activities and 
results will be reported septel.
