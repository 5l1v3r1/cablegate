 EconOffs delivered reftel points to the Ministry of 
Industry, Tourism, and Trade's Director of International 
Affairs and Telecommunications, Marta Cimas Hernando. 
EconOffs explained that the US was interested in amending the 
international Radio Frequency Allocation Table to support 
certain space exploration programs.  Cimas indicated that 
they were receptive to the proposal, but needed time to 
review it in more depth. The Ministry is currently examining 
the detailed white paper which Post forwarded on June 8. We 
will follow up with the Ministry at a later to date to see if 
they have further questions or thoughts.
