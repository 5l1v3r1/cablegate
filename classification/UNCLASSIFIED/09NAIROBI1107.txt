SUBJECT: SOMALIA - URGENT NEED FOR FUNDING AS FIGHTING 
CONTINUES IN MOGADISHU 
 
REF: NAIROBI 1105 
 
¶1. (C) As the TFG continues to fight designated Foreign 
Terrorist Organization al-Shabaab in Mogadishu, the appeals 
from President Sharif, Prime Minister Sharmarke, and TFG 
force commander "Dhumaal" for urgent funding to support their 
efforts have intensified.  As reftel notes, in the last two 
days the TFG has succeeded in pushing al-Shabaab and other 
extremist forces opposing it out of key districts of the 
Somali capital.  The TFG is eager to capitalize on its 
success, and to that end has been seeking additional 
ammunition and funding for its forces. Problems in rapidly 
transporting ammunition and weapons available from UPDF 
stocks at Entebbe have made the immediate provision of 
financial aid all the more critical. 
 
¶2. (C) Embassy urges that the Department authorize a second 
tranche of USD 500 thousand in funding to the TFG.  In 
Embassy's judgment, the initial tranche of USD 500 thousand, 
which the TFG has fully accounted for, made a key 
contribution to the success of the TFG's current 
counter-offensive.  In addition to permitting it to pay its 
troops, and purchase weapons and ammunition, the funds 
provided concrete evidence of USG engagement in the efforts 
of the TFG to defeat al-Shabaab. 
 
¶3. (C) Should the Department approve, the funds would be used 
to pay salaries and/or procure urgently needed support for 
fighting the extremists. The Embassy continues to prefer that 
in-kind assistance be provided to the TFG, but the 
rapidly-evolving security situation and the urgency of 
capitalizing on the TFG's fragile advantage in our view 
mandate that cash grant assistance be immediately provided.
