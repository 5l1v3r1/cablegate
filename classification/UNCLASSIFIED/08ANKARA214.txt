REF: ANKARA 202 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. On February 6, the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture (MARA) 
confirmed a third outbreak of Avian Influenza in just over two 
weeks.  This one is in Sakarya province, 125 kilometers east of 
Istanbul.   MARA officials stated that on February 4 suspicious 
birds were tested. The test results showed that the birds died of 
the H5N1 strain of the AI virus. As a result, MARA culled 1905 
poultry in Sakarya Province and 1315 poultry in neighboring Kocaeli 
province.  Quarantine measures have also been implemented. 
 
¶2. Comment: MARA seems to be taking all necessary measures, 
including releasing timely press reports.  That the villagers 
apparently have immediately notified MARA of dead birds is evidence 
that MARAQs public education campaign has been effective.
