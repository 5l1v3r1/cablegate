¶1.  Pol/Econoff delivered reftel points to Pekka Kosonen 
Counsellor for the Department for External Economic Relations 
at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  Kosonen noted that 
there is no unanimous opinion in the E.U. regarding GI and 
TRIPS issues and that the divide is clearly cut between 
northern and southern countries.  Finland feels the need to 
uphold its E.U. obligations thought it understands the 
position of the U.S.  Kosonen also pointed out that spirits 
are not a large issue with Finland nationally as it is not a 
significant export. 
 
¶2.  Kosonen said that, "There could be positive movement on 
this issue," at the TRIPS council in Geneva on October 27. 
He emphasized that the GOF believes that the U.S. and E.U. 
could be more understanding of each other's position and not 
make this into a bargaining issue that could potentially hold 
up a successful outcome to the Doha negotiations.
