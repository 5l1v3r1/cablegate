¶3.  On September 24, the high-level committee that oversees the 
implementation of the Joint Communique on the facilitation of 
humanitarian activities in Darfur met in Khartoum.  The Joint 
Communique signed in March 2007 by the GNU and the UN is intended to 
improve the efficiency and processing of bureaucratic procedures 
that hinder NGO operations in Darfur, including visa, travel permit, 
and custom clearances.  The meeting was co-chaired by the Government 
of National Unity (GNU) Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and the UN 
Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator/Deputy Special Representative 
of the Secretary General.  Attendants included representatives from 
the GNU Humanitarian Affairs Commission (HAC) and Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, the United States, the Democratic Republic of 
Congo, the Arab and African Groups, international and national NGOs, 
and the UN.  U.S. Charge d'Affaires Alberto M. Fernandez and USAID 
staff attended the meeting in the role of the donor observer.
