SECRETARY-GENERAL 
 
Ref: BERC/124/ER/US/Vol. 1/(010) 
 
20 February 2009 
 
The Honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton 
Secretary of State 
Washington D.C. 
 
Dear Secretary Clinton, 
 
I would like to thank you for visiting the ASEAN 
Secretariat on 18 February 2009.  My staff and I are very 
grateful to you for taking time out from your official 
visit to Indonesia to make a historic visit to the ASEAN 
Secretariat. 
 
Your visit to the Secretariat clearly demonstrated the 
seriousness of the US to re-establish the US diplomatic 
presence in this region and to robustly re-engage ASEAN in 
order to take our ties to a higher plane. 
 
As a region, ASEAN - East Asia is ready, able and willing 
to work with the US in the search for solutions to global 
impasses, including bridging the cultural divide. 
 
I warmly welcome the Obama Administration's commitment to 
launch its interagency process to pursue accession to the 
Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. 
 
I look forward to meeting you at the ASEAN Post 
Ministerial Conference and at the 16th ASEAN Regional 
Forum in July 2009 in Thailand. 
 
Please accept, Secretary Clinton, the assurances of my 
highest consideration. 
 
//s// 
 
Dr. Surin Pitsuwan
