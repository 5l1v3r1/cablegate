LARGEST ETHANOL PRODUCTION IN HISTORY 
------------------------------------- 
¶1.  According to data from Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture, Brazil 
produced more ethanol in 2006 than any other production period.  The 
2006 harvest produced a total of 17.8 billion liters compared to a 
16.9 billion liter production from the period before.  According to 
Angelo Bressan, Director of the Ministry's sugar-cane production 
office, the rise in production will avoid the ethanol price 
variation that took place in Brazil during the non-harvest period 
last year.  The country's total planted area of sugarcane increased 
6%, reaching a total of 6.19 million hectares. 
 
ETHANOL IN BRAZIL PRODUCTION TO BE STANDARDIZED 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶2.  Brazil's Industrial Production Quality Institute (INMETRO) and 
several other government agencies have signed an agreement that 
seeks to standardize the production of ethanol in the country. 
Under the agreement, INMETRO will produce reference materials and 
production standards in order to raise Brazil's export of ethanol, 
and with an eye toward avoiding technical and international barriers 
for the product abroad.  In September 2006, INMETRO and the U.S 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) co-sponsored a 
workshop to explore cooperation on metrology and standards for 
biofuels.  During that workshop, INMETRO officials said developing 
standards for the production of ethanol, both in Brazil and 
globally, was a key step in promoting ethanol as a commodity. 
 
BRAZIL'S TOP ETHANOL PRODUCER PLANNING TO EXPAND 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
¶3.  Brazil's largest sugar and ethanol producer, the Cosan group, 
headed by Rubens Ometto, has announced plans to double its current 
production capacity of 40 million tons a year and to reach 20% of 
Brazil's exports for those two products over the next eight years. 
The company has 17 production plants in Brazil and plans to invest 
in India and in the United States, two of the world's top consumers 
and producers. 
 
PLANT WITH BIOFUEL POTENTIAL 
---------------------------- 
¶4.  Brazil is considering the use of the Pupunha palm (known as the 
"peach-palm" in English) to increase the production of biodiesel in 
Brazil.  According to Lidio Coradin, Genetic Resources Coordinator 
at the Ministry of Environment, the Pupunha palm produces 20 tons of 
oil per hectare, four times more than the African palm, which is 
second in terms of sources of world vegetable oil consumption. 
Cultivation of Pupunha palm, found in the Amazon region and Central 
America, has been expanding to provide heart of palm, but not yet 
for its vegetable oil, which can be used to make biodiesel.  It is 
one of 775 native species with economic potential identified by the 
Ministry, which will publish this information in five volumes, 
starting this year, in a bid to encourage their sustainable use. 
 
FRENCH GROUP TO INVEST 100 MILLION EUROS IN BRAZIL 
------------------------------------------- 
¶5.  Due to the reduction in subsidies for sugarcane production in 
Europe, French Group Tereos plans to invest 100 million Euros in 
Brazil over the next four years.  The company's goal, according to 
media reports, is to process 17 million tons of sugarcane into sugar 
and ethanol by the year 2010.  Tereos, which is already a major 
stockholder in one of Brazil's top eight ethanol-producing 
companies, will add two other power plants in Brazil to the three 
they already own.  The first of the two plants is planned to be 
online in August 2007 and will cost approximately USD 35 million. 
 
BRAZILIAN COMPANY INVESTS IN BIODIESEL IN THE U.S 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶6.  Brazilian company Incobrasa said it will invest USD 12 million 
in a biodiesel production plant in the state of Illinois.  This is 
the first reported instance of a Brazilian owned company investing 
in biodiesel in the U.S.  This is the first significant investment 
that the company will make in the U.S. since 1997 when its soybean 
pressing plant was built in the state of Illinois.  The pressing 
plants process 2,000 tons of soybeans a day.  The biodiesel plant 
will be built next door to the soybean plant because 60% of the 
total pressed soybean product will be used to produce the biodiesel. 
 
 
JAPAN TO USE BRAZILIAN ETHANOL IN 2010 
-------------------------------------- 
¶7.  According to media reports, Japan plans to use ethanol, produced 
by Brazilian state-owned company Petrobras, in some of the 
countries' electric energy plants.  Approximately two thirds of 
Japanese energy production for thermo stations comes from fossil 
fuels.  Petrobras will work with Japanese importer Mitsui to reach 
an export goal of 3 billion liters to Japan.

BRAZIL TO TEST HYBRID FUEL - CELL AND BATTERY-POWERED BUSES 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶8.  Brazil's Mines and Energy Ministry and Sao Paulo's Metropolitan 
Urban Transport Company (EMTU) have launched a USD 16 million pilot 
project to put five hybrid buses into operation by the year 2009 
that will be powered by rechargeable batteries and hydrogen fuel 
cells.  Meanwhile, the agency is also developing catalytic 
converters for its buses to cut down on emissions.  The buses, which 
will get 70% of their power from fuel cells and 30% from batteries, 
will be the first of their kind to be used commercially in Latin 
America, says Marcio Schettino, an EMTU manager heading the project. 
 The effort will include the construction of a hydrogen production 
plant.
