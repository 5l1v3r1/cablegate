1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification (PSV) at ADM Cocoa Pte. Ltd., 
342 Jalan Boon Lay, Singapore (ADM).  The item in question is one 
three inch ductle iron/pfa lined plug valve exported on or about 
February 4, 2007 and valued at USD 1,150.  The item is classified 
under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 2B350 and is 
controlled for chemical/biological weapons (CB) reasons.  The 
exporter was Xomox Corporation of Cincinnati, Ohio. 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore Companies Registry, ADM has been in 
existence since 1984.  It is the Singapore factory of the 
multinational corporation, Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM).  In 
Singapore, it produces a range of cocoa bean products 
(www.admworld.com).  Its share capital in Singapore is just over USD 
20 million. 
 
¶4.  On June 20, 2007, the ECO met with Mr. Tuck Luen Cho, Manager of 
Maintenance.  Mr. Cho confirmed that ADM had received the valve and 
also that it had been informed of the applicable license conditions 
for the item.  He showed the ECO the location where the valve (as 
well as many more valves or a similar type) had been installed. 
While ECO could not closely inspect the valve, he has no reason to 
believe the valve shown to the ECO was not the actual valve 
referenced in the shipping documents. 
 
¶5.  At the time visited, ADM appeared to be a suitable recipient of 
the commodities shipped since ADM cooperated with the PSV, provided 
the ECO with access to the item and operates a line of business 
consistent with the use of the item. The ECO recommends that this 
PSV be classified as Favorable.
