¶1. (U) Summary.  In a twenty-four hour stopover in Jakarta 10-11 
June following participation in an APEC Avian Influenza activity in 
Bali, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Regulatory and Marketing 
Programs Chuck Lambert made a courtesy call on senior Ministry of 
Agriculture (MOA) officials, and met with the USG Avian Influenza 
assessment team, and Indonesian Council of Ulama (MUI) officials 
involved in halal certification of food products for the Indonesian 
market.  The meeting with MUI officials revealed that MUI officials 
participation in the USDA Cochran Program visit to halal certifying 
bodies in the US opened a line of communication that will support 
the establishment of a more transparent and workable system for 
certification of US food products in Indonesia.  End Summary. 
 
Call on Secretary General, MOA 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2.  A Call on Dr. Hasanuddin Ibrahim, Secretary General, MOA and a 
number of senior staff on 10 June provided Dr. Lambert the chance to 
highlight the US position regarding issues recently raised in the 
FAO Summit, which the Indonesian Minister of Agriculture attended. 
These included the US positions on the impact of biofuels production 
on food prices, biotechnology and export restrictions for food 
products and agricultural commodities.  In addition, the recent 
agreement by the USG to accede to Japanese food aid grants or sales 
of Market Access Rice (MAS) stocks were also discussed.  In response 
to the Secretary General's request for continued collaboration with 
USDA, he was provided with details regarding a 2002 PL 480 Agreement 
with the GOI in which the GOI agreed to set aside $US 3 million for 
agriculturally-related Fulbright activities.  The Ministry of 
Finance has earmarked the funds, but to date the MOA has not applied 
for their use, nor prepared any proposals for the program. 
 
¶3.  The Secretary General provided little detail as to MOA positions 
with respect to these issues, but promised to study them with his 
staff.  The one issue that he raised was the difficulty in 
developing the agricultural potential of Papua, which he stated was 
a priority for the MOA. 
 
The Cochran Fellows from MUI, a Window of Opportunity? 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶4. On June 11 - the Deputy Under Secretary and emboff met with two 
MUI officials, a staffer from the Directorate General for Livestock 
Services, MOA, and an official from B-POM, the GOI equivalent of the 
US FDA.  These officials had recently returned from a USDA Cochran 
Fellowship Program to a number of halal certifying bodies in the US 
as well as a series of animal product processing establishments. 
All sponsored travelers were very positive on the benefits of 
learning more about food processing and the halal process in the US. 
 From the discussion, it appears that the Cochran event exceeded 
expectations of the Cochran Fellows and FAS/Jakarta as well.  The 
unofficial group spokesman, a senior auditor for MUI, noted that one 
of his goals now is to move forward with the halal certification 
process, in collaboration with certifying bodies in the US, to be 
able to provide reasonably priced US beef for consumption by 
Indonesia's Muslims during the holy month of Ramadan.  The team 
would like to see the use of a very sharp knife for animal welfare 
reasons, continual prayers as animals are slaughtered versus just at 
the beginning of a shift, and stunning that does not immediately 
kill the animal in question, in the US animal processing 
establishments.
