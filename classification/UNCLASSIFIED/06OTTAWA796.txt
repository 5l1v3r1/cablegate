March 15, 2006 
 
Thank you for your fax of March 2 in which you requested 
support for the operations of the State Court War Crimes 
Chamber in Bosnia & Herzegovina. 
 
While CIDA is very supportive of building local capacity to 
try cases in the region, we unfortunately have no funding 
available to support the War Crimes Chamber after 2006.  All 
of our funds have been committed to 2010 for programming in 
the rule of law, health and education sectors in the Balkans, 
and the focus of CIDA's program in the Balkans is now on 
maximizing the impact of these projects. 
 
Although CIDA is unable to contribute resources to the War 
Crimes Chamber, we would still be interested in keeping 
abreast of its work.  CIDA is currently funding a judicial 
reform project in Bosnia & Herzegovina and Serbia & 
Montenegro, as well as several corrections projects, and so 
we would be interested in knowledge sharing. 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to wish you success in 
securing the required funding. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
Nicole Gesnot 
Director 
Balkans, South Caucasus and Graduating Countries
