TREASURY DESIGNATES IRANIAN NUCLEAR AND MISSILE 
ENTITIES. AUGUST 12, 2008. 
 
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTINUES ITS EFFORTS TO COUNTER 
IRAN'S PURSUIT OF TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD ENABLE IT TO 
DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THE MISSILES CAPABLE OF 
DELIVERING NUCLEAR WARHEADS.  ON AUGUST 12, 2008, THE 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY DESIGNATED FIVE IRANIAN 
ENTITIES THAT ARE OF PROLIFERATION CONCERN FOR THEIR 
TIES TO IRAN'S NUCLEAR AND MISSILE PROGRAMS.  THESE 
ACTIONS PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE U.S. AND WORLDWIDE PROTECT 
THEMSELVES FROM DECEPTIVE FINANCIAL PRACTICES EMPLOYED 
BY IRANIAN ENTITIES THAT ENGAGE IN OR SUPPORT 
PROLIFERATION. 
 
THE ENTITIES DESIGNATED TODAY INCLUDE THE NUCLEAR 
RESEARCH CENTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND MEDICINE (A/K/A 
KARAJ NUCLEAR RESEARCH CENTER), THE ESFAHAN NUCLEAR FUEL 
RESEARCH AND PRODUCTION CENTER (NFRPC), JABBER IBN 
HAYAN, SAFETY EQUIPMENT PROCUREMENT COMPANY (SEP CO.), 
AND JOZA INDUSTRIAL COMPANY. 
 
ALL FIVE OF THE ENTITIES DESIGNATED TODAY WERE 
PREVIOUSLY DESIGNATED BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  THE 
NUCLEAR RESEARCH CENTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND MEDICINE AND 
THE NFRPC WERE BOTH DESIGNATED BY THE UNITED NATIONS IN 
THE ANNEX TO RESOLUTION 1747 FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN 
IRAN'S NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES.  JABBER IBN HAYAN, JOZA 
INDUSTRIAL COMPANY, AND SEP CO. WERE DESIGNATED BY THE 
UNITED NATIONS IN ANNEX III TO RESOLUTION 1803 FOR THEIR 
INVOLVEMENT IN IRAN'S NUCLEAR OR BALLISTIC MISSILE 
PROGRAMS. 
 
THIS ACTION WAS TAKEN PURSUANT TO EXECUTIVE ORDER 13382, 
AN AUTHORITY AIMED AT FREEZING THE ASSETS OF 
PROLIFERATORS OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND THEIR 
SUPPORTERS, AND AT ISOLATING THEM FROM THE U.S. 
FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS.  DESIGNATIONS UNDER 
E.O. 13382 ARE IMPLEMENTED BY TREASURY'S OFFICE OF 
FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (OFAC), AND THEY PROHIBIT ALL 
TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE DESIGNEES AND ANY U.S. PERSON, 
AND FREEZE ANY ASSETS THE DESIGNEES MAY HAVE UNDER U.S. 
JURISDICTION. 
 
THE NUCLEAR RESEARCH CENTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND 
MEDICINE, THE NFRPC, AND JABBER IBN HAYAN HAVE BEEN 
DESIGNATED PURSUANT TO E.O. 13382 BECAUSE THEY ARE OWNED 
OR CONTROLLED BY, OR ACTING OR PURPORTING TO ACT FOR OR 
ON BEHALF OF, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE ATOMIC ENERGY 
ORGANIZATION OF IRAN (AEOI). 
 
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH IN JUNE 2005, DESIGNATED THE 
AEOI IN THE ANNEX TO E.O. 13382.  THE AEOI, WHICH 
DIRECTLY REPORTS TO THE IRANIAN PRESIDENT, IS THE MAIN 
IRANIAN ORGANIZATION FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD OF NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING 
IRAN'S CENTRIFUGE ENRICHMENT PROGRAM, AND MANAGES IRAN'S 
OVERALL NUCLEAR PROGRAM.  THE AEOI WAS DESIGNATED BY THE 
UNITED NATIONS IN THE ANNEX TO UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTION 1737 FOR ITS ROLE IN IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM. 
 
THE NUCLEAR RESEARCH CENTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND MEDICINE 
AT KARAJ IS A LARGE AEOI RESEARCH COMPONENT.  THE NFRPC 
IS AEOI'S CENTER FOR DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR FUEL AND IS 
INVOLVED IN ENRICHMENT-RELATED ACTIVITIES.  THE NFRPC'S 
URANIUM CONVERSION FACILITY, IN OPERATION SINCE 2005, 
CAN PRODUCE MOST OF THE URANIUM COMPOUNDS NEEDED FOR 
FUEL CYCLE ACTIVITIES.  URANIUM CONVERSION IS AN 
ESSENTIAL STEP FOR THE CREATION OF NUCLEAR FUEL. 
 
JABBER IBN HAYAN, ALSO PART OF THE AEOI, IS INVOLVED IN 
THE FIELD OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE NUCLEAR 
CYCLE, IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING A WIDE RANGE OF 
LABORATORY SERVICES FOR THE AEOI'S NUCLEAR PRODUCTION 
DIVISION. 
PRESIDENT BUSH ALSO DESIGNATED IRAN'S AEROSPACE 
INDUSTRIES ORGANIZATION (AIO) AND THE SHAHID HEMMAT 
INDUSTRIAL GROUP (SHIG) IN THE ANNEX TO E.O. 13382.  THE 
AIO IS THE OVERALL MANAGER OF IRAN'S MISSILE PROGRAM AND 
OVERSEES ALL OF IRAN'S MISSILE INDUSTRIES.  SHIG IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR IRAN'S BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAMS, MOST 
NOTABLY THE SHAHAB SERIES OF MEDIUM-RANGE BALLISTIC 
MISSILES.  THE AIO AND ITS SUBORDINATE ELEMENTS, SUCH AS 
SHIG, OFTEN USE FRONT COMPANIES TO ACCESS FOREIGN 
TECHNOLOGY AND RAW MATERIALS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
IRAN'S MISSILE PROGRAM. 
 
SEP CO. HAS BEEN DESIGNATED TODAY FOR BEING OWNED OR 
CONTROLLED BY, OR ACTING OR PURPORTING TO ACT FOR OR ON 
BEHALF OF, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE AIO.  THE AIO HAS 
BEEN USING SEP CO. TO PROCURE ON ITS BEHALF SINCE AT 
LEAST 2003. 
 
JOZA INDUSTRIAL COMPANY HAS ALSO BEEN DESIGNATED TODAY 
FOR BEING OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY, OR ACTING OR 
PURPORTING TO ACT FOR OR ON BEHALF OF, DIRECTLY OR 
INDIRECTLY, SHIG.  IN AN EFFORT TO EVADE SANCTIONS AND 
OBSCURE ITS PROCUREMENT EFFORTS, SHIG UTILIZES A SERIES 
OF FRONT COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE JOZA INDUSTRIAL 
COMPANY, TO PURCHASE GOODS AND MATERIALS. 
 
IN ADDITION TO THESE DESIGNATIONS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO 
NOTE THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION ADOPTED A COMMON POSITION 
(CP) IMPLEMENTING THE PROVISIONS OF UNSCR 1803, WHICH 
ENTERED INTO FORCE ON AUGUST 7, 2008. THE CP UPDATES THE 
PREVIOUS EU COMMON POSITION ON RESTRICTIVE MEASURES 
AGAINST IRAN AND IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL ENTITIES AND 
INDIVIDUALS TO BE COVERED BY THE RESTRICTIONS ON 
ADMISSION AND THE FREEZING OF FUNDS IN UNSCR 1803. THE 
AUGUST 7 CP ALSO PRESCRIBES VIGILANCE OVER FINANCIAL 
TRANSACTIONS, EXPORT CREDITS, DUAL-USE ITEMS AND CARGO 
INSPECTIONS.
