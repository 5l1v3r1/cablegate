¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, JSC 
Digaz, Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS 
license application D368208 as the ultimate consignee 
of a thermal imager, model: 1100. These items are 
controlled for national security, nuclear non- 
proliferation reasons under ECCN 6A003. The licensee 
is Mikron Infrared, Inc., 16 Thornton Road, Oakland, 
NJ 07436. 
 
¶3. On December 22, 2006, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of JSC 
Digaz, 125, Profsouznaya St., Moscow, Russia. The 
export control team met with Sergey Grom, Deputy 
General Director. 
 
¶4. Digaz was founded in 2002 as an independent service 
company providing expert diagnostic and survey 
services to the oil and gas transport industry in 
Russia.  The company is principally contracted to 
provide diagnostic services for pipelines owned by 
Gazprom, the Russian Federation owned natural gas 
company.  Digaz employs around 100 and has its offices 
in the regional Customs Service building in Southwest 
Moscow.  Currently Digaz only works within Russia, but 
is hoping to expand operations to Kazakhstan and other 
CIS countries where Gazprom has pipeline facilities or 
connections. 
 
¶5. The commodity in reftel will be used for heat loss 
surveys in pump houses and other structures along the 
pipelines and at refineries.  Temperature control is 
an essential part of pumping operations in arctic 
climates, and thermal imagery is a very effective 
tool.  No more than ten specialists will be authorized 
to utilize the camera.  The camera will be stored in a 
vault in the security storage area, and authorized 
technicians will have to sign a logbook prior to 
security officers issuing the camera.  Security at the 
building is provided by a contract guard service, 
which is on premesis 24 hours a day. 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post recommends JSC Digaz, Moscow, 
Russia, as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. 
origin commodities. It is requested that post be 
notified of final disposition of the application, and 
of any shipments for this organization in order to 
conduct appropriate FCS follow-up and statistical 
reporting.
