¶1.  (U)  This is an action message.  USUN is authorized to 
urgently share the draft resolution in para 2 below with the 
French Mission, and other UNSC members at USUN's discretion, 
with a view towards spurring Council action on the 
Hizballah-initiated violence in Lebanon which began on May 8. 
 Department requests USUN report back initial reaction from 
the French and others. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Begin text: 
 
Recalling all its previous resolutions on Lebanon, in 
particular resolutions 1559 (2004), 1680 (2006), and 1701 
(2006), and its statements of 30 October 2006, 12 December 
2006, 17 April 2007, 11 July 2007, 3 August 2007, and 11 
December 2007, 
 
Reaffirming its support for Lebanese constitutional 
institutions, in particular the government and the Lebanese 
Armed Forces and its strong support for the territorial 
integrity, sovereignty and political independence of the 
Lebanese state within its internationally recognized borders, 
 
Condemning the unlawful acts of violence committed by 
Hizballah since 7 May 2008, and expressing its utmost concern 
for the loss of life of Lebanese civilians and its 
condolences to the families of the victims and to the 
government and people of Lebanon, 
 
Reiterating its grave concern about the continued presence of 
armed militias in Lebanon, which prevent the Lebanese 
Government from exercising its full sovereignty over all 
Lebanese territory, 
 
Noting its deep concern about continuing reports about 
weapons flows across the Syria-Lebanon border in violation of 
resolution 1701 (2006) and the lack of progress in 
delineating the international border of Lebanon or in 
developing border monitoring mechanisms; 
 
Welcoming the statement of 11 May 2008 of the Arab League, 
which rejected the use of arms and violence to achieve 
political goals, and its intention to dispatch a delegation 
to Lebanon to lead a return to dialogue, 
 
Determining that the ongoing violence is exacerbating the 
situation in Lebanon, and further determining that that 
situation continues to constitute a threat to international 
peace and security, 
 
¶1.  Demands the immediate cessation of fighting, withdrawal 
of all militias from the streets, the reopening of Beirut 
International Airport and the Beirut port to ensure the 
freedom of movement of Lebanese and others to and from the 
country, and the removal of all barricades to ensure freedom 
of movement within Lebanon; 
 
¶2.  Calls for the immediate election of a president without 
prior conditions or foreign interference, the establishment 
of a national unity government, and the holding of general 
elections in conformity with an electoral law agreed upon by 
all parties, in accordance with the Arab League plan; 
 
¶3.  Demands the full and immediate implementation of all 
provisions of resolutions 1559 (2004), 1680 (2006), 1701 
(2006), and 1747 (2007), noting in particular the importance 
of Syria and Iran complying with these resolutions, and 
expresses its intention to consider further measures in order 
to help ensure: 
 
--  the immediate disbanding and disarmament of all Lebanese 
and non-Lebanese militias, including Hizballah; 
 
--  the immediate cessation of all sales or supplies of arms 
and related materiel to Lebanon except as authorized by its 
Government; 
 
¶4.  Calls for immediate international investigation of the 
Syrian role in providing arms to Hizballah and other militias 
in violation of resolutions 1559 (2005), 1701 (2006), 1747 
(2007), and 1803 (2007); 
 
¶5.  Urges Member States to suspend international flights to 
and from Damascus International Airport and International 
airports in Iran until Beirut International Airport is 
allowed to reopen; 
 
¶6.  Expresses its intention to consider measures against 
Hizballah for failure to implement resolution 1559 (2005) and 
1701 (2006), and terrorist acts; 
 
¶7.  Requests the Secretary General to develop proposals for 
assisting the Government of Lebanon secure its borders and 
other entry points to prevent the entry in Lebanon without 
its consent of arms or related materiel; 
 
¶8.  Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
