¶1.  EconPolCouns delivered reftel demarche on May 14 to Klaus 
Famira of the Austria MFA's OSCE office.  Fammira said he 
thought Austria would designate a senior Interior Ministry 
official as head of delegation to the May 31-June 1 
Counter-Terrorism Conference.  He did not yet know exactly 
who it would be. 
 
¶2.  Famira thanked us for informing him that Frank Urbancic 
will head the U.S. delegation.  He asked for as much 
information as possible on the make-up of the rest of the 
U.S. delegation.  He confessed that he was unsure of the type 
of people he should include in the delegation. 
 
¶3.  (Note:  We had planned to present this demarche jointly 
with a Russian Embassy officer.  However, at the last minute, 
our Russian counterpart had to regret because of a health 
emergency that landed him in the hospital.  We conveyed the 
results of the demarche to his colleagues at the Russian 
Embassy.)
