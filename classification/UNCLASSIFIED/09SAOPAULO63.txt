Title- Obama and Lula 
 
Op-Ed in liberal in Folha de S.Paulo (1-29) by Eliane Catanhede 
says: "...Brazil is in the focus in all themes related to the 
environment.  In [areas of] traditional energy, Brazil became 
self-sufficient in oil, already exports it and has just announced 
the pre-salt [oil discoveries].  In alternative energy it has 
natural resources, continental proportions, climate and 
state-of-the-art technology.  Those circumstances, combined with 
Brazil's projection, facilitate the agenda and the closeness between 
Obama and Lula." 
 
 
Title- Problems in the Persian Gulf 
 
Op-Ed in liberal in Folha de S.Paulo (1-29) by Kenneth Maxwell 
states: "Today there are 146 thousand U.S. soldiers in the country 
[Iraq].  Ending this arrogant chapter of American History will not 
be easy.....The problem with Iraq is that its future is tied to U.S. 
policy with respect to Iran....But negotiating with Teheran has 
proven itself to be impossible since the Islamic Iranian 
revolution....the perspectives remain gloomy.  It is unlikely that 
the new U.S. government will accomplish its promises to withdraw 
itself from Iraq in an orderly way and in accordance with a precise 
schedule.  And it is unlikely that Iran reaches an agreement with 
the U.S. that involves the abandonment of the nuclear option. " 
 
 
Title- Bolivian Division 
 
Editorial in Folha de S.Paulo (1-29) says: "Up to now, contrary to 
[the goal of] pacifying forces in dispute and deepening democratic 
institutions, the referendum to approve the new Bolivian 
Constitution has had the consequence of newly radicalizing the 
country." 
 
 
Title- U.S. pursuit of a new trade policy 
 
Column in business oriented Valor Econtmico (1-29) by Ricardo 
Balthazar says: "The contrast between old American ambitions and the 
current reality is instructive.  It shows that the economic crisis 
made the U.S. trade agenda obsolete and suggests that the U.S. needs 
to find another [trade agenda] to enable things in order to advance 
in this area again....many groups have presented suggestions to 
Obama's team in the last months.  A point onwhich everyone agrees is 
that Obama will only gain support for a new trade policy if it 
strengthens its social programs to protect U.S. workers....Another 
point of divergence is....the necessity of combining trade 
discussions with world efforts to contain climate changes.  U.S. 
specialists also agree about the necessity to change the manner in 
which trade talks are conducted." 
 
 
Title- Gloominess in Davos 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (1-29) states: 
"Executives of major groups and internationally renowned economists 
seem to be in accordance: there will not be optimistic talks in the 
short run at the World Economic Forum, which began on Wednesday in 
Davos, Switzerland ... Growth in 2009 will certainly not happen, but 
the policies adopted this year will be crucial to [enable] a 
recovery.  The review of policies and the definition of new paths 
will also be vital for the quality and sustainability of the new 
phase of economic expansion."
