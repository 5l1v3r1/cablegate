HK 03068 (2007) 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), conducted 
a Pre License Check (PLC) at Scitop Instrumentation Co, Unit 2, 
28/F, Kwong Kin Trade Centre, No. 5 Kin Fat St., New Territories, 
Hong Kong (SCITOP). The item in question is a centrifugal pump 
classified under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 2B350 
and controlled for chemical and biological weapons reasons (CB). 
This pump is the subject of export license application D421434.  The 
license applicant is Cole Parmer Instrument Company of Vernon Hills, 
Illinois. 
 
¶3.  SCITOP was the subject of a prior unfavorable EUC in 2007 as 
more fully described in reftel C.  In that case, SCITOP was unable 
to account for the final disposition of other CB controlled items 
sent under BIS license. 
 
¶4.  SCITOP has maintained its web presence at www.scitop.com as 
noted in reftel C.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, 
SCITOP's sole director is listed as Mr. Wong, Yuk Cheung (this is 
down from several directors in 2007).  SCITOP's parent company is 
registered as Trade International Limited. 
 
¶5.  On August 20, 2009, ECO visited the company and met with Mr. 
Wong with whom ECO had met in 2007.  Mr. Wong recalled the prior 
meeting.  Mr. Wong stated that the business had remained more or 
less the same since that time (although some directors had left the 
company and business was down a bit).  Mr. Wong's business card 
lists Guangzhou (SCITOP Instrument Company Ltd.) and Shenzhen 
affiliates (Right Products Company Limited) as well as a Shanghai 
sales office.  Mr. Wong stated that the parent company (Trade 
International) previously owned other subsidiaries but that this 
company will be closed in the coming months.  Mr. Wong characterized 
the mainland operations of the company as comprised of sales 
agents. 
 
¶6.  As to the specific order in question, Mr. Wong provided a 
purchase order from his customer ASTRI. This entity is a Hong Kong 
government affiliated business incubator for Hong Kong companies 
(ASTRI.org).  A call to ASTRI confirmed that this entity had ordered 
the item in question. 
 
¶7.  Mr. Wong conceded that the prior post shipment verification 
(PSV) had not gone well in that he had been unable to confirm the 
final destination of certain items.  He stated that the PSV had been 
a learning experience for him and that he understood better now the 
need to keep better records and to have greater control over 
transactions with controlled items. 
 
¶8.  Based on the information detailed herein, ECO believes the item 
in question is destined to ASTRI as provided in license application 
D421434.
