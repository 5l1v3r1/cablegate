¶1. (U) Embassy contacted Francois-Regis Boulvert, 
international cooperation chief at CELAR, the foreign 
end-user.  (Reftel stated that CELAR is an 
"unfamiliar foreign party" but according to post 
files, we have handled other license checks where 
CELAR was the end-user, e.g., 05-1001124.)  He 
confirmed that the MOD laboratory CELAR is the end- 
user of the synthesizers and associated data in the 
license request.  In his letter Boulvert states: 
 
-CELAR confirms that the articles ordered by the 
broker Elexience (reftel) are to be integrated into a 
test-bench for CELAR called by COBRA NG.   The test 
bench is a radar simulator. 
 
-Elexience intervenes in its role as subcontractor of 
the company INEO Defense ELG which was awarded the 
contract for the development of the test-bench. 
 
-CELAR completed a request for export authorization 
signed by the Director of CELAR, that was transmitted 
to INEO Defense ELG on January 22, 2008.  This 
request is likely still in the process of being sent 
on to the American authorities.

¶2. (U) Post also contacted the broker, Elexience. 
Point of contact Anita Squedin (Tel: +33-1-69-53-80- 
44) confirmed that her firm has certified broker 
status and was handling the acquisition of the 
synthesizers for INEO Defense in the context of its 
contract with CELAR. 
 
¶3. (U) The commercial director of INEO Defense 
confirmed his company's awareness of prohibition on 
reexport of munitions list items.  He explained that 
the two synthesizers in question are specifically for 
use in the test-bench contracted by CELAR, noting 
that the French MOD (practically the only customer 
his company has, he said) would not permit export of 
such items in any event.  He noted that his company 
is now a subsidiary of the Suez conglomerate.  The 
point of contact for any further clarification, if 
needed, is Mr. Alain Sterczynski (Tel: +33-4-92 96 28 
58).
