¶1. New Zealand (NZ) is recognized as a global leader in the 
production of sheep wool. With the exception of wool, this 
country's textile requirements are dominated by imports. New

interior textiles such as carpets, upholstery, furnishings, 
beddings and rugs. It is also used for hand-knitting yarn and 
in knitwear and blankets. The industry has estimated that 34% 
of new Zealand wool is used in machine-made carpets, 12% in 
hand-knotted and hand-tufted carpets, 44% in apparel and 10% 
in other uses, primarily upholstery and bedding.

significant apparel import source. China is the leading
