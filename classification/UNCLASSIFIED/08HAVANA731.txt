HURRICANE IKE UPDATE 
 
¶1. Post's Emergency Action Committee (EAC) met this afternoon to 
discuss changes to Hurricane Ike's projected path and the potential 
impact to UNINT operations. 
 
¶2. As of 2:00 p.m., Saturday, Ike was a Category Three (3) storm 
approximately 300 miles east of Cuba and scheduled to make landfall 
near Holguin Province on Sunday evening.  The National Hurricane 
Center projects the storm to pass over Havana either late Monday or 
early Tuesday. 
 
¶3. Earlier today, USINT contacted all American staff to gauge 
interest in an authorized departure but only one family expressed 
the desire to leave.  A final decision regarding authorized 
departure will be made at the EAC scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. 
The EAC also discussed the likelihood of relocating seven families 
living near the ocean to residences in elevated parts of the city to 
include the Marine Security Guard Detachment.  The Detachment will 
be stationed at USINT during the storm. 
 
¶4. The EAC also discussed early departure for employees on Monday 
and closing USINT on Tuesday due to the storm and, if that's the 
case, will issue appropriate public announcements via the Internet 
and consular call center. 
 
¶5.  Post EAC will meet again on Sunday at 12:00 noon.
