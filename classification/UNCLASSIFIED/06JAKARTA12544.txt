TRIAL 
 
REF: JAKARTA 12161 
 
¶1.  Prosecutors delivered their sentencing requests in court 
on October 13 for seven suspects accused of involvement in 
the murder of two Amcits in Timika, Papua in 2002. 
Prosecutors requested a sentence of 20 years for Antonius 
Wamang and 15 years for Agustinus Anggaibak and Yulianus 
Deikme on the charge of premeditated murder.  For the other 
four defendants, prosecutors requested eight years on the 
lesser charge of accessory to murder. 
 
¶2.  The six defendants who came to the court session once 
again refused to stand trial and were removed from the 
courtroom.  Before their removal, Wamang and Reverend Isak 
Onawatme complained about the situation of fellow suspect 
Hardi Sugomol, who was not in attendance and whose health has 
been deteriorating since the trial began.  According to 
Wamang, the doctor who examined Sugomol told them that 
Sugomol was suffering from inflammation of the heart and 
liver and had sustained damage to his lungs as a result of 
tuberculosis.  Chief Judge Adriani Nurdin then said that she 
and the prosecutors would meet with the doctor to discuss 
whether Sugomol needed to be hospitalized.  (Note:  Sugomol 
was hospitalized for a period of 15 days earlier in the 
trial.  Funding for health care for prisoners is available 
but rather difficult to obtain.  In many cases the 
prosecutors must pay the hospital out of pocket and then try 
to get reimbursed.)  The defense lawyers did not attend the 
session. 
 
¶3.  In view of the upcoming Idul Fitri holiday marking the 
end of Ramadan, Judge Nurdin scheduled the next session for 
October 31.  Defense attorneys will have an opportunity to 
respond to the sentencing requests at that time.  In order to 
comply with limits on detention of suspects, the judges must 
hand down their verdicts before November 17.
