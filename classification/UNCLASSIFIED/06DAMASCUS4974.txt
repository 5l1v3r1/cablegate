In a meeting with the head of the Political Department of the 
Palestinian Liberation Organization, Farouq Qadoumi, President Assad 
stressed the importance of Palestinian national unity and the 
continuation of inter-Palestinian dialogue to achieve the ultimate 
goals of the Palestinian people, mainly ending the Israeli 
occupation and establishing an independent Palestinian state with 
Jerusalem as its capital. 
 
President Assad also met with Egypt's Intelligence Chief, Omar 
Suleiman, who delivered a letter from Mubarak dealing with 
"bilateral relations and developments in the region." 
 
Papers also covered a meeting between the Palestinian Minister of

¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
"Bush's Comma" 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
"So long as the US Administration uses this discourse, and so long 
as President Bush considers what is going on now in Iraq as a mere 
comma in Iraqi history, the series of setbacks and curses shall 
haunt the current US Administration until its last day in office, 
and shall hit its members with something worse than Gulf War Disease 
after they leave office. 
 
"How can a human being believe...that the lives of 650,000 Iraqis 
are a mere comma, when Iraqi history is written.  Mr. President, 
when, then, is life valuable? 
 
"The problem of President Bush's Administration, with itself and its 
people, is that it does not want to admit the faults that it has 
committed and is planning to commit in the Arab region, especially 
regarding Iraqis and Palestinians.... Blair's Government, a US ally, 
has started to learn from what has happened and is preparing itself 
to correct its mistakes, as its Military Chief said a couple of days 
ago.  Still, this change will not save Blair's government from 
setbacks and curses, which will continue to follow it until its last 
minute."
