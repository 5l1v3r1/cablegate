SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: INVITATION FOR INDONESIA TO 
PARTICIPATE IN COESPU 
 
REF: STATE 5646 
 
¶1. (U) Poloff delivered reftel invitation to Indonesia 
National Police (INP) Headquarters Director for Personnel 
Development BG Hendy and his Chief for International 
Cooperation, Bekti Suhartono, on January 25.  Hendy is the 
INP's designated point of contact for international training 
assistance.  We presented the demarche jointly with the 
Political Counselor and the Defense Attache from the Italian 
Embassy.  The Italian Defense Attache also provided a copy of 
a presentation from COESPU itself on the training program. 
We emphasized the importance of English-language skills and a 
commitment to establishing an ongoing train-the-trainer 
program. 
 
¶2. (U) Hendy and Suhartono responded positively to the 
invitation, saying they favored Indonesia's participation and 
noting Indonesia's prior contribution of police peacekeepers 
to international missions, including Afghanistan, Bosnia, 
Namibia and Cambodia.  They noted the short submission 
deadline for participants' lists but said the INP would try 
to assemble the necessary names in time. 
 
¶3. (U) To secure INP participation, they requested that the 
two embassies send a formal letter of invitation to National 
Chief of Police Sutanto.  (Note: Sutanto visited the United 
States for consultations with law enforcement counterparts 
during the week of January 22.)  Embassies are sending 
parallel letters signed by their ambassadors, using 
information from reftel.  Copies of the letter will be 
delivered to the Office for North American Affairs and the 
Office or International Security and Disarmament in the 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU). 
 
¶4. (U) Embassy will follow up with Hendy and Suhartono closer 
to February 2 and after Police Chief Sutanto's receipt of the 
letter, to confirm Indonesia's intention to participate and 
ability to provide a list of qualified candidates in time.
