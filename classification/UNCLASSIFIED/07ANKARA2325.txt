¶A.  Site Assessment and Meetings During Recent Reporting 
Period 
 
1)  Aug 3 -   EXBS Advisor met with MFA Arms Control and 
Disarmament Chief of Section Bora Kerimoglu to discuss 
current projects in Turkey, including a proposed grant 
agreement for new Z-Backscatter Van, Turkish Customs training 
cooperation project and the Department of Energy/Second Line 
of Defense (SLD) engagement proposal. EXBS Advisor reviewed 
meetings held the end of July between visiting SLD delegation 
and Turkish National Police and Turkish Customs officials, 
explaining how each program is building on past activities 
with a goal of developing capabilities of both services. 
EXBS Advisor shared draft documents which outlined short term 
and long term goals which were being finalized between SLD, 
TNP and Turkish Customs.  Kerimoglu expressed MFA's support 
in the cooperation between Turkish and US agencies and 
requested MFA be kept informed as these plans and activities 
progress.  EXBS Advisor presented a copy of the International 
Grant Agreement and explained how this Agreement could be 
utilized to transfer to Turkish Customs the ZBV van which was 
already in Turkey.  EXBS Advisor reinforced that this would 
be a one time grant could be done outside the NP Cooperation 
(EXBS) Agreement, if both countries agreed.  Kerimoglu 
concurred that this could be possible, however he would need 
to review the grant document with appropriate offices.  He 
then added that he was hopeful that the US and Turkey could 
continue to find ways to cooperate while we await the 
conclusion of the EXBS Agreement.  EXBS Advisor agreed and 
reviewed the training and visits that had occurred or occur 
between US and Turkish Customs. 
 
2)  Aug 21 - EXBS Advisor met with Custom EU and External 
Relations Deputy Director General Ihsan Kocer to discuss 
future steps in the development of the Turkish Customs 
Training Academy.  EXBS Advisor provided a briefing on a 
proposal to bring to Turkey a team of 4 CBP instructors to 
observe current on-the-job training being conducted at 
various Customs locations and who could also work with the 
current Turkish Customs Academy staff to standardize lesson 
plans and other information.  Kocer welcomed this proposal, 
but said he would first like to review the finding of the 
report completed in June on current training for Turkish 
Customs officials.  He added that with the new change in 
government, it may be a few months before all newly promoted 
or assigned officials will be in position to approve this 
next phase of cooperation.  EXBS Advisor agreed that delaying 
this visit may be in the best interest of the program and 
that he would work to obtain a copy of the formal report for 
Turkish Customs review.  EXBS Advisor provided an update 
concerning the Turkish Customs International Sea Port 
Interdiction Training (ISIT), Radiation Detection Training 
and Hazardous Material training.  EXBS Advisor added that he 
had received positive feedback from MFA concerning the DOE 
SLD visit and that planning for the replacement of the 
current monitors could begin soon. 
 
3)  Aug 22 - EXBS Advisor met with Customs Enforcement Deputy 
Director General Ender Gurleyik to conduct pre-departure 
briefing for the Turkish Customs delegation traveling to the 
United States to participate in the Radiation Detection 
Training in Richland WA.  Gurleyik, who was the senior member 
of the Turkish delegation, stated that all members were ready 
to attend the training and that he hoped to be able to 
utilize the information obtained from training in future 
on-the-job training conducted by Turkish Customs.  EXBS

Advisor noted that the training provide by DOE will be 
similar to training which will be conducted following the 
replacement and upgrading of the nuclear portal monitors and 
that individuals attending the training now would be able to 
better assist in this process.  Finally, EXBS Advisor updated 
Gurleyik on the status of the grant agreement for the ZBV van
