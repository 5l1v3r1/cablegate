HURT 
 
 
¶1.  On December 26 at 8:26 pm a strong earthquake registering 
6.7 on the Richter scale struck southern Taiwan.  The quake, 
with an epicenter 21.8 km southwest of Hengchun was felt as a 
Richter 4 quake in the city of Kaohsiung, and a Richter 2 
quake in Taipei.  A second tremor, magnitude 6.4, with an 
epicenter 27.9 km southeast of Kaohsiung, struck at 8:34 pm. 
The two tremors collapsed at least three buildings, trapped 8 
people under rubble and caused two casualties and 38 wounded. 
 The earthquake also knocked out cell and land line phone 
communication in Kaohsiung until after 2310 hours. 
 
¶2.  After phone lines were restored AIT/K was able to contact 
its wardens in Pingtung county, all of whom reported no Amcit 
casualties among the registered 4,000 Amcits in southern 
Taiwan.  AIT/K also contacted the Foreign Affairs Police in 
Pingtung county who reported that none of the over 490 
resident Amcits was injured.  AIT has received very few calls 
from relatives of the Amcits.  The tremors caused power 
outages to 4,000 households and the no. 2 reactor at Maanshan 
nuclear power plant was briefly shut down.  Power was 
restored to half of the households later in the evening.  The 
latest tremor, a magnitude 5.9 quake happened on Dec. 27 at 
10:30 am with an epicenter 40.25 km west of Hengchun, also in 
southern Taiwan.  While damage from the quakes was limited to 
a few collapsed buildings, the quakes served to alert the 
authorities to focus on southern Taiwan as an earthquake 
prone zone and to plan emergency measures accordingly. 
Seismologists attribute the quakes to movement of the 
continental plates in the Manila Trench.
