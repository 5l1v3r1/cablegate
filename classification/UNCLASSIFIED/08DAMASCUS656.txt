MUSIC ABROAD PROGRAM'S NEW SEASON 
 
REF: STATE 090853 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY: Embassy Damascus requests participation in the 
Rhythm Road American Music Abroad Program during February-May 2009. 
A program of "urban music" will help Post reach out to youth in a 
country where over 50 percent of the population is under 20 and 
Western hip hop receives wide play.  Through this program, Post will 
foster connections with youth alumni of exchange programs (ACCESS, 
PLUS, YES, MEPI), and hard-to-reach university students, as well as 
broaden Post's contacts in Syria's music and arts scene.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
---------------- 
PROGRAM OVERVIEW 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) A three-day program in Syria for American hip hop performers 
would include all or some of the following activities: 
 
- Public concert performance, Damascus 
- Club performance, Damascus 
- Workshop/performance for students, Damascus 
- Special event for young Department of State exchange program 
alumni 
- Radio interviews/performances, Damascus 
- Workshops with students and teachers at the Higher Institute of 
Music, Damascus 
- Public concert performance, Homs 
- Workshop/performance for students of the Music Education Faculty, 
Al-Ba'ath University, Homs 
 
¶3.  (U) Any group that travels to Syria should be prepared to act as 
educators as well as performers.  The group should be able to talk 
with youth audiences about the history of hip hop, its social 
significance, and its musicality.  They should be prepared to answer 
the two questions: What makes hip hop unique? What makes it uniquely 
American? 
 
----------------------------------- 
DAMASCUS MSP GOAL: PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) A program of hip hop music or similar will help Post to 
reach out to a younger and larger audience than traditional music 
programming.  This supports the MSP goal of mutual understanding and 
nurturing strong people-to-people contacts and relationships, 
especially with the successor generation. 
 
------------------------------ 
TIMING, LOGISTICS, AND FUNDING

¶5.  (U) Post requests a program for four or five days, plus two 
travel days, during February-May 2009, excluding the weeks of March 
8-12 and April 19-23. 
 
¶6.  (U) Post will provide in-country transportation and per diem and 
cover any staging costs for performances, possibly with support from 
local sponsors.
