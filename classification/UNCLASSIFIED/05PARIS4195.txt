START MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
Our primary objective is to renew our contact with a rising 
star within the French Socialist Party, at a particular 
crucial time for the future of that party as it develops its 
platform and goals in preparation for the 1997 Presidential 
and legislative elections. At the same time, in the longer 
term, we would like to give Albertini, a specialist of 
European and environmental issues, exposure to the U.S. A 
previous nominee from the French Socialist Party returned from 
his trip to the U.S. with the conviction that the Socialist 
Party had previously "overlooked" the importance of the 
bilateral U.S.-French relationship.  Lack of exposure to the 
U.S. explains general antagonism towards the U.S. way of life. 
We believe Albertini will occupy important functions if the 
Socialists return to power and should therefore acquire 
greater insight into U.S. policies. 
END MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD: 
Given Albertini's intellectual pedigree and professional and 
political experience, we believe he would greatly gain from 
participation into the European Program: "U.S. Foreign Policy 
Challenges"

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Mr. Albertini has advanced quickly within the elite of the 
French civil service. A graduate of the prestigious French 
National School of Administration ENA, he was picked out as 
one of the most promising graduates of his class by one of the 
best "headhunters" in French political circles, former 
European Affairs Minister Pierre Moscovici.  He then followed 
the typical French bureaucratic elite curriculum, first at one 
of France's most prestigious administrative bodies, the French 
Accounting Court (similar to the GAO), and then in three 
different ministries, at senior levels, including Chief-of- 
Staff. 
His previous government experience on issues key to ongoing 
and future U.S. trade policy objectives, i.e. trade, European 
Affairs and the environment, combined with his intellectual 
curiosity and his good standing within the Socialist Party, 
make him an obvious choice for the IV Program.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
At 33, Pierre France is the youngest of the region-wide 
reporter team at Dernieres Nouvelles d'Alsace (DNA - circul. 
224,000), the largest regional daily newspaper in Alsace. 
While he entered that professional circle as a specialist in 
multimedia/Internet issues, he also writes articles on youth 
at risk, ethnic ghettos in Alsatian suburbs, crime, Turkey and 
Europe, the Eurocorps and Afghanistan, and even articles on 
American politics, based on interviews with visiting Americans 
(e.g., the widow of Gene Kelly).  Pierre France speaks 
English, but only traveled once to the United States for three 
weeks as a tourist in September 2000.   While preparing a 
Master's degree at the Strasbourg School of Journalism, he did 
an internship at DNA, then a short stint as a free-lance 
journalist there, before being hired as a full-time DNA 
journalist. 
Pierre France's versatility leads his Chief Editor, former 
Franco-American Foundation grantee, to place great hopes in 
his career.  Chief Editor Dominique Jung credits Pierre France 
with "extensive intellectual curiosity and dynamism, willing 
and able to report on a wide variety of subjects."  Jung 
thinks his young charge would absorb a great deal from an 
International Visitor experience.   Disarmingly unassuming at 
first blush, Pierre France is also a semi-professional actor 
in an improvisation theater group, and a fiction writer 
(unpublished so far).  His interests range far beyond 
multimedia and the arts; he also has a keen interest in social 
and international issues, especially international crime, and 
would greatly benefit from an IV experience in the United 
States. 
With the Schengen Information Center, the Franco-German Center 
for Police Cooperation, the Council of Europe's GRECO (Group 
of States Against Corruption), and its University's new degree 
in combating money-laundering, Strasbourg brings together many 
experts in international crime.  Pierre France is poised to 
pull these strands together in his reporting.  Insights gained 
from an IV program could help inform his reporting in a way 
that could foster our transatlantic cooperation on various 
issues.
