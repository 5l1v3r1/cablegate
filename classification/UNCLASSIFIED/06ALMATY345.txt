REF: STATE 3488 
 
¶1.  Per reftel instructions, on January 24 Econoff confirmed 
the existence of TOO CII "International Engineering" at 142, 
Boghenbai Batira Street, Office 625, Almaty, Kazakhstan. 
The company occupied a modest, yet apparently legitimate and 
functional, suite of rooms. 
 
¶2.  However, at the time of Econoff's visit, the company was 
on the eve of changing locations, and on January 31 informed 
the Embassy of a new address: 20A Kazibek Bi St., Almaty, 
Kazakhstan.  The company does not yet have phone lines in 
the new offices. 
 
¶3.  The company's Office Director, Natalya Moon (cell: 8 300 
760 1555), confirmed that "International Engineering" 
performs aerial mapping.  However, Moon resisted 
characterizing the company as an "aerial mapping company," 
stating that its primary purpose was more broad: "oil and 
gas diagnostic work."  Further, Moon was not aware of the 
"proposed joint venture with the German firm InterEng 
Messtechnik and the Russian firm Geokosmos-GIS, Ltd." 
 
¶4.  The point-of-contact listed in reftel, Edwin Kramer, 
appears to be based in Germany and visits the Kazakhstan 
office irregularly.  Thus, Post was unable to verify the 
existence of the joint venture described in reftel.
