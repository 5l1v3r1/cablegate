¶1.  We have received a Diplomatic Note (text below) informing 
the United States that the Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade

accepted the customized software.  The GOT requests that 
written permission be given to the GOT to place this

¶2.  Test of Diplomatic Note: 
 
"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States 
of America and has the honour to inform the Embassy that the 
project for the adaptation and translation of the ICP 
(Internal Control Program) software for use by the 
Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade of Turkey, under the 
financial commitment of the United States Government, has 
been successfully completed by the contracted company 
"Docuart" and the software delivered to the Undersecretariat 
of Foreign Trade following its control. 
 
In this context, the Ministry also requests the Embassy's 
kind assistance in providing the Undersecretariat of Foreign 
Trade, with a written permission by the copyright owner of 
the Internal Control Program, for the web-based use of the 
software by the Undersecretariat. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey 
avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of 
the United States of America the assurances of its highest 
consideration."
