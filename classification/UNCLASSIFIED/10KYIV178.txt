2A. PREVALENCE AND SECTORAL DISTRIBUTION OF EXPLOITIVE CHILD LABOR 
--------------------------------- -------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (U) According to the 2006 ILO-IPEC Rapid Assessment Survey on the 
Use of Child Labor (RAS), exploitive child labor most commonly 
occurs in street trade, entertainment services (bars, night clubs), 
sexual exploitation (prostitution, pornography) and other illicit 
activities, including forced begging. 
 
¶2. (U) GOU did not perform a formal collection of data on exploitive 
child labor in 2009. 
 
2B. LAWS AND REGULATIONS 
------------------------ 
 
¶1. (U) In January 2009, Article 150*1 of the Criminal Procedural 
Code of Ukraine was amended to increase the penalty for criminals 
convicted of using minors for begging.  The sentence was set at five 
years of imprisonment, or ten years if aggravating circumstances 
were involved.  This was a definite improvement over the original 
wording of Article 150, which was vague and had not strictly defined 
'exploitation'. 
 
In March, 2009, the GOU enacted a State program entitled "National 
Action Plan to Implement UN Convention of the Rights of the Child". 
This plan includes a series of concrete steps and benchmarks for 
putting the laws concerning children's rights into practice, with a 
timeline running from 2010 to 2016.  Due to limited levels of 
enforcement of existing laws, this is a positive development. 
 
Cabinet of Ministers Order No. 1263, enacted on October 21, 2009, 
allocated funding in the amount of UAH 63,000 (USD 7,875) to set up 
a national monitoring system to eliminate child labor (Chapter 4.6 
of the National Action Plan), and UAH 940,000 (USD 117,500) to 
efforts against trafficking-in-persons, sexual exploitation, and 
violence against children (Chapter 4.7 of the National Action Plan). 
 This is regarded as a positive first step, but nothing more, as the 
funding levels are too low to achieve significant results. 
 
¶2. (U) Ukraine's legal and regulatory framework is sufficient to 
address exploitive child labor.  However, enforcement of the laws in 
this area is sorely lacking.  Spot inspections can only detect a 
small percentage of violations, and a pervasive culture of 
corruption enables employers to avoid liabilities by bribing 
regulators and law enforcement officials to ignore violations. 
 
2C. INSTITUTIONS AND MECHANISMS FOR ENFORCEMENT 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2C, Section I: Hazardous child labor 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶1. (U) Enforcement of laws relating to hazardous child labor is the 
shared responsibility of six separate agencies: the Ministry of 
Labor and Social Policy and its State Labor Inspectorate, 
Occupational Safety and Health Inspectorate, the Ministry of the 
Interior's Criminal Police for Juvenile Affairs (CPJA), the Ministry 
of Family, Youth and Sport Department on Adoption and Children' 
Rights Protection, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Security 
Service of Ukraine (SBU). 
 
¶2. (U) These six agencies regularly exchange information by holding 
joint meetings and sending case data via inter-office mail to foster 
cooperation at various stages of investigation and prosecution. 
There are no shared electronic databases among enforcement bodies, 
and the shortage of funds negatively affects cooperation, but the 
strong inter-agency relationships allow this system to have a 
positive impact. 
 
¶3. (U) In October 2009, the SBU established a telephone hotline for 
reporting sexual exploitation of minors via the Internet, as part of 
their Department to Protect Against Cybercrime.  Statistics on the 
number of complaints received in 2009 have not been released.  For 
other cases of hazardous labor, there are no special reporting 
 
KYIV 00000178  002 OF 007 
 
 
mechanisms.  Interested parties can file reports with any GOU 
agency.-Oc'Qity. 
 This number of inspectors is not considered adequate, given the 
lack of transportation and other resources. 
 
¶6. (U) Over 20,000 labor inspections were conducted in 2009, and 347 
of them found instances of child labor.  Inspections were carried 
out in all sectors of the economy.  The number of inspections, 
roughly two per inspector per month, was not adequate. 
 
¶7. (U) 682 child victims were assisted in 2009.  Generally, the 
employers were fined, and criminal cases were opened if the 
exploitation was deemed serious.  Services were usually not provided 
to the exploited children by labor inspectors, however the children 
were referred to the appropriate services as per their needs. 
 
¶8. (U) 34 criminal cases were opened between January and April 2009 
for exploitive child  labor, in addition -  17 cases were filed 
against adults accused of forcing children to g/Q `QQ of exploitive child labor cases 
resolved is not available for 2009. 
 
¶10. (U) Information on the number of convictions reached in 
exploitive child labor cases was not available for 2009. 
 
¶11. (U) Information on the average length of time required to 
resolve exploitive child labor cases was not available for 2009. 
 
¶12. (U) Information on the application of penalties against those 
found guilty of exploitive child labor violations was not available 
for 2009. 
 
¶13. (U) The Ukrainian government's commitment to combat exploitative 
child labor is shown by its adoption of the "National Action Plan to 
Implement UN Convention of the Rights of the Child." 
 
¶14. (U) The GOU offers labor inspectors training on child labor 
issues.  The curriculum includes training in how to handle the 
discovery of exploitive child labor.  During their careers, 
inspectors receive additional training at the regional level. Also, 
the police officers are provided with the child labor trainings at 
the Academy of Interior as part of their certification process. In 
2009, the International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor 
(IPECSm
