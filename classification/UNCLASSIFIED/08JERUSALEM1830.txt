BUSH-ABBAS MEETING - "JUST A PROTOCOL FAREWELL" 
 
Please note that in observance of the Eid Al Fitr holiday, 
Palestinian dailies were not printed on October 1 and October 2.

Main Stories: 
------------- 
Wafa and Ma'an online news agencies quote Palestinian Authority 
President Abbas describing his recent visit to the White House as, 
"successful."  Abbas explains that President Bush feels that 
Palestinians have met their responsibilities.  This "positive 
report," Abbas continues, will make it easier for Palestinians to 
work with the next U.S. administration.  Wafa also reports that 
Secretary of State Rice telephoned Abbas to follow up on matters 
related to his recent visit to Washington. 
 
Ma'an reports that the Palestinian Authority (PA) has published the 
names of 38 Hamas sympathizers who have been released from PA 
detention centers in the West Bank.  Hamas, however, disputes that 
any release occurred, according to report.  In related news, the 
on-line media quote Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 
reaffirming his commitment to "stand by" Hamas leaders in Gaza. 
According to the reports, Khamenei told Iran's state-run tv that 
Hamas leader Haniyyah will, "never have to stand alone," and that 
Haniyyah is a "mujahid," or holy warrior. 
 
Palestinian news agencies confirm that the Israeli army will no 
longer use "US-manufactured" cluster bombs.  The on-line media also 
note that the Israeli military has ended its two-day "siege" on the 
West Bank and Gaza, during which all crossing points were closed for 
the Jewish new year celebration.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
Â¶1.  Independent Ma'an online news agency publishes an article about 
the recent White House meeting between President Bush and 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas,  written by political advisor 
to Abbas, Ahmad Abdul Rahman(10/02):  "[I]t was just a protocol 
farewell meeting, nothing more, since Mr. Bush is a lame duck, as 
they say in America.  There was nothing new... Abbas [repeated what 
he told the] UN General Assembly; that he demanded full withdrawal 
[by Israel from the West Bank], a comprehensive solution, opposition 
to any partial solution, that the issues of Jerusalem and refugees 
must not be excluded [from negotiations]; in other words, that any 
solution that is not comprehensive or complete and does not include 
all issues will be rejected.  Mr. Bush listened to these words."
