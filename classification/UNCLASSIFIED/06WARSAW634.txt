¶1.  (SBU)  Contacts at Poland's Ministry of Finance reported 
to Econoff that the Ministry is preparing for a Financial 
Action Task Force evalution that will occur in May.  Ministry 
of Finance contacts stated that they expect results to be 
issued within six months of the visit, and that the Ministry 
will post results to its website once they are received. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Comment.  The GOP continues to pursue its goal of 
FATF membership.  Our contacts mentioned that Poland has 
complied with all previous FATF recommendations and believe 
that this evaluation will show the strength of the GOP's 
anti-money laundering program.  Though the GOP still would 
like to become a member of FATF, our contact echoed the 
common wisdom within the GOP that understands that membership 
 is now more a political than technical issue.
