REF: STATE 12447 
 
(SBU) Germany welcomed the U.S. assurances from Reftel 
confirming the reciprocal limited use and disclosure of any 
information the U.S. might obtain from Germany in the course 
of their collaboration on the Oak Ridge - Technische 
Universitat Forschungsreaktor Munchen project.  Joerg 
Polster, MFA Desk Officer, told Econoff that he did not 
believe there would be any technology transfer from Germany 
to the U.S. on this project, but noted that any such transfer 
would likely require an application to BAFA, the German 
export control authority.
