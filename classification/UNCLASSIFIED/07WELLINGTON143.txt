SUBJECT: Proposal for U.S. Speaker Dr. Karen Litfin to attend the 
2007 Otago Foreign Policy School as the keynote U.S. Speaker. 
 
 
¶1. Post requests U.S. speaker Dr Karen Litfin, Associate Professor, 
who specializes in international relations theory and international 
environmental politics at the University of Washington at Seattle, 
where she is primarily interested in the impact of science and 
technology on world politics.  In support of MPP Goal 07-01 - Mutual 
Understanding, we would ideally like this visit to be for seven 
program days, Wednesday, June 20 - Tuesday, June 26; third quarter, 
FY 2007, and are requesting this speaker as part of the Strategic 
Speakers Initiative (SSI). 
 
¶2. Justification and Objective: Since its inception in 1966, the 
University of Otago's Foreign Policy School (OFPS) in the university 
city of Dunedin, on the South Island, has developed an international 
reputation, drawing top speakers from around the world. The Embassy 
has made a conscious effort to support this conference, especially 
when the subjects are of serious bilateral interest. It is a 
conference at which many government officials from the Prime 
Minister's Office, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of External 
Relations and Trade, academics, journalists, diplomats, members of 
the private sector and interested public regularly participate; and 
it would provide an excellent venue for U.S. interests to be 
effectively voiced.  The timing and choice of this year's theme, 
"Environmental Governance and State Autonomy in a Changing Climate," 
which will focus on how the unique international environment of the 
21st Century is shaping environmental governance at the 
international level, is most appropriate. 
 
In the 21st century environmental change is a serious issue, but the 
evolving international context in which it is occurring has limited 
policy making at the highest levels. In particular, since 9/11 the 
international system has, arguably, focused less on so-called "soft" 
foreign policy issues, such as the environment.  There is growing 
alarm over the rapid rate of environmental degradation. The debate 
about climate change is forcing environmental issues back to the 
highest levels of international diplomacy and policy-making agendas. 
Despite this, little headway is being made on global governance on 
environmental issues. Now with mounting evidence that the changing 
climate is having large-scale human and financial impacts on the 
world's most influential countries (especially the U.S.), these are 
finally beginning to be addressed with the urgency that they 
deserve. 
 
¶3. Post considers that Professor Litfin's expertise (she's a 
prolific writer on the subject) would dovetail perfectly with the 
speaking topics of other keynote speakers at this 42nd Foreign 
Policy School conference.  This would be a valuable opportunity to 
discuss relevant issues with this renowned academic whose 
publications include: 
 
 Editor, The Greening of Sovereignty in World Politics (The MIT 
Press, October 1998). 
 
 Ozone Discourses:  Science and Politics in International 
Environmental Cooperation (Columbia University Press, 1994).

¶4. Activity Date, Fiscal Year and Quarter: This is an FY07 program, 
which is requested for the Third Quarter, June 20-26, 2007. 
 
¶5. Audience and Types of Events: It is expected that the audiences 
for this program will be members of parliament and their 
policy-makers, economists, academics, the media, members of the New 
Zealand Institute of International Relations in three of the main 
centers, and sporting organizations.  It is anticipated that 
Professor Litfin will also visit the university centers of 
Wellington and Auckland and undertake several media and 
representational events while in New Zealand. 
 
¶6. Topics: While speech topics are to be decided in consultation 
with Professor Litfin, it is expected that the 42nd Foreign Policy 
School would really benefit significantly from the first-hand 
insights and knowledge of such a distinguished person.  We plan to 
discuss the exact subject of the presentations and roundtables 
outside this conference with Professor Litfin should the proposal be 
accepted. 
 
¶7. Please Note: The conference conveners have been in contact with 
Professor Litfin and confirm that she is available and interested in 
traveling to New Zealand at this time.  A CV is requested, along 
with speaking topics.  Post has traditionally supported this 
conference, but did not do so last year.  We consider that this 
year's important subject warrants our support.

¶10. Funding: Post considers that this speaker fits perfectly with 
the SSI program theme,"Environmental Protection and Energy: U.S. 
partnerships with other Nations and International Organizations. 
Sharing Ideas on Energy, Environment, and Development. U.S. 
Achievements in Restoring and Protecting the Environment."  As 
mentioned in paragraph 1, it is expected that this proposal would be 
funded through the Strategic Speaker's Initiative (SSI), which would 
fund the speaker's international and domestic travel, per diem, and 
honoraria to cover all aspects of this seven-day program. 
Post is also hoping that other countries in the region, including 
partner posts, might be interested in sharing this speaker because 
of the vitally important topic.  Please advise soonest.  Many 
thanks.
