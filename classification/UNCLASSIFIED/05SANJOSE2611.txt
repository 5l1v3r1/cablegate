SUBJECT: DISCUSSION OF CAFTA-DR BY PRESIDENTS BUSH AND 
PACHECO AT SUMMIT OF THE AMERICAS 
 
 
¶1.  Summary:  On November 5, 2005, all of the major Costa 
Rican dailies ran stories based on comments made by 
President Pacheco and Foreign Trade Minister Gonzalez about 
the meeting with President Bush the day before on the 
United States-Central American-Dominican Republic Free 
Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR).  The general themes of the 
reported comments made by President Pacheco and Minister 
Gonzalez were that President Bush showed great respect for 
Costa Rica's democratic processes and the U.S. was not 
pressuring Costa Rica to hasten CAFTA-DR ratification. 
President Pacheco's readout emphasizing "respect" made for 
a very positive pro-Costa Rica spin to the reports of the 
meeting.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  President Pacheco commented about his meeting with 
President Bush in a press conference in which the leaders 
of the Central American countries took part on November 4, 
¶2005.  The press reported that the meeting with President 
Pacheco was President Bush's first event of the day that 
later included the official opening ceremony of the Summit 
of the Americas.  Much attention was given to the fact that 
President Pacheco sat next to President Bush during the 
opening of the Summit in Mar del Plata, Argentina. 
 
¶3.  President Pacheco and Minister Gonzalez were reported 
as saying that President Bush is paying special attention 
to Costa Rica with respect to CAFTA-DR.  President Pacheco 
said that he explained that Costa Rica is a country that 
goes at its own pace, that has its own way of doing things, 
and that is something that should be respected.  Minister 
Gonzalez said that President Bush repeated several times to 
"take your time" and "you are doing all right" with respect 
to how Costa Rica was proceeding on CAFTA-DR.  (Note:  Both 
phrases were quoted in both Spanish and English in the 
articles.  End Note.)  The officials said that President 
Bush expressed confidence that Costa Rica would eventually 
be part of the free trade agreement.  The reports added 
that President Bush at no time pressured Costa Rica to 
hasten the approval process and was very respectful of the 
Costa Rican democratic process.
