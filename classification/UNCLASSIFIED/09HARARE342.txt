On the Political/Social Front 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  Stalemate Continues...  The GOZ's executive committee, 
consisting of President Robert Mugabe and his two vice-presidents 
and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai and his two deputy prime 
ministers met on Thursday for the second time this week to resolve 
outstanding issues.  The principals will brief their parties this 
weekend and resume discussions on Monday. 
 
¶3.  Biti Demands Investigation of Gono, Travels to U.S...  Minister 
of Finance Tendai Biti reportedly demanded that Cabinet investigate 
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor Gideon Gono over the RBZ's US$1.2 
billion debt.  Biti has been seeking, without success, Gono's 
removal as governor.  Biti is in Washington, DC for Spring IMF/World 
Bank meetings this weekend, and for meetings with U.S. officials. 
 
¶4.  Ministerial Visit Fails to Quell Disruptions at Farms... 
Violent incidents continued to occur at several disputed 
Chegutu-area farms following visits by Deputy Prime Minister Arthur 
Mutambara and other high-ranking government ministers on April 17. 
Police shot two employees of the Stockdale Farm, which is being 
contested by Senate President Edna Madzongwe and the owner, Peter 
Etheredge.  The two were rushed to a Harare hospital; one lost part 
of his leg.  Last week Madzongwe's supporters beat to death an area 
resident attempting to steal fruit from a tree.  At a different farm 
an employee was thrown into a fire, but survived.  At four other 
Chegutu farms, a mix of war veterans and youth broke locks to gain 
entry, destroyed personal property, and barred access to farm 
employers and employees.  During his visit, Mutambara had strongly 
criticized the invaders and ordered them to leave and allow the 
courts to determine ownership.  See Harare 333. 
 
¶5.  Constitutional Committee Still Lacks a Chair...  The three 
political leaders (Mugabe, Tsvangirai and Mutambara) have still not 
determined who should lead the Select Constitutional Committee 
responsible for directing the process to a new constitution.  The 
dispute is over whether it should be led by a parliamentarian or an 
independent individual.  In the interim, the committee will be 
Qindependent individual.  In the interim, the committee will be 
co-chaired by two MPs: Douglas Mwonzora of the MDC-T and Munyaradzi 
Mangwana of ZANU-PF.  Attempting to defuse civil society's 
opposition to the drafting process, Prime Minister Tsvangirai met 
with the head of the National Constitutional Assembly, Lovemore 
Madhuku, on April 22.  According to independent press reports, the 
two men failed to reconcile differences.

¶6.  Political Detainees Rearrested...  After being released on bail 
on April 17 and while being treated for injuries at the Avenues 
Clinic in Harare, two of the last three identified MDC political 
detainees were once again placed under armed guard at the clinic. 
According to the detainee's lawyer, the guards said that Gandhi 
Mudzingwa and Chris Dhlamini would remain in police custody.  A 
manhunt has begun for freelance photographer Andrison Manyere who 
left the hospital after bail was granted.  The State belatedly 
appealed bail, allowing the police to resume guarding Mudzingwa and 
Dhlamini.  An additional seven unidentified abductees remain 
unaccounted for.  See Harare 332. 
 
¶7.  Kunonga vs. Bakare - The Battles Against the Anglican Church 
Continue...  While poloff was meeting with a group of Anglican 
priests on April 21, one received a call that his church in 
Avondale, Harare was being cleaned out by supporters of ZANU-PF 
stalwart, excommunicated former Bishop Kunonga.  At the church, 
about 30 Kunonga supporters and suspected ZANU-PF youths were 
outside the building piling up office furniture, files, and even 
little red and blue chairs from the church preschool.  While 
claiming to have a court order supporting the eviction, the 
Kunonga-affiliated rector could not produce it.  Police refused to 
stop the Kunonga group.  The first item the Kunonga supporters moved 
in was a large photo of Robert Mugabe.   This comes less than two 
weeks after the co-ministers of Home Affairs directed the two 
factions to share church property. 
 
¶8.  While Anglican Priests Face Charges...  After being arrested on 
March 29 while attempting to hold church services in the Harare 
suburb of Glen Norah, six defendants (a priest, a student priest, a 
church youth leader, a church warden, and two parishioners) loyal to 
Bakare appeared in court on April 20 to face charges of disturbing 
the peace and inciting violence.  When the police witnesses for the 
prosecution did not show up, the case was remanded (for a second 
time) to April 23. The State presented their cse on April 23 and 
the hearing was adjourned after several hours until April 27 when 
the church will present its case and the priests will testify. 
 
¶9.  Media Groups Slam Proposed Media Conference...  Civil society 
groups Zimbabwe National Editors Forum, Media Monitoring Project 
Zimbabwe, MISA Zimbabwe, and the Africa Community Publishing 
Development Trust have described the proposed government-sponsored 
media conference agenda as "fatally compromised and anathema to 
media freedom and the principles of the Global Political Agreement." 
 The media conference whose theme is "Towards an Open, Tolerant and 
Responsible Media Environment" is scheduled for May 6 to 8 in 
Nyanga, Manicaland.  The groups contend that most of the proposed 
facilitators and presenters are "hostile to media freedom and the 
free flow of information within Zimbabwe." 
 
¶10.  Germany Lifts Travel Warning...  On April 21, Germany announced 
Q10.  Germany Lifts Travel Warning...  On April 21, Germany announced 
it was lifting its travel warnings to Zimbabwe.  This follows recent 
announcements by both the U.S. and Japan to remove travel 
advisories. 
 
----------------------------------- 
On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  Gono Admits to Raiding Bank Accounts...  Reserve Bank Governor 
Gideon Gono admitted on April 20 that he took hard currency from the 
bank accounts of private businesses and foreign aid groups without 
permission, but with government authorization, saying he was trying 
to keep his country's cash-strapped ministries running.  Gono also 
published in the Herald a detailed accounting of all the cars his 
ministry purchased and to which ministries they were sent.  Gono is 
trying to make the case that all his actions were sanctioned by the 
government to assist the government. 
 
¶12.  Old Mutual to Pay Pensions in Foreign Exchange...  Old Mutual 
 
HARARE 00000342  003 OF 003 
 
 
advised pensioners that it will pay pensions in foreign currency in 
June.  Old Mutual had suspended pension payments in January 2009, 
citing lack of liquidity arising from the suspension of trading on 
the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange.  It is not yet clear how much 
pensioners will receive given the current market liquidity 
constraints. 
 
¶13.  Credit Crunch May Force Government to Sell Parastatals...  The 
Herald on April 22 reported on its website that Zimbabwe is 
considering selling some state-owned enterprises in order to raise 
money to fund the economic recovery process.  The notice goes on to 
state that the Finance Minister and the Minister of State 
Enterprises will table this proposal at a Cabinet meeting the week 
of April 26. 
 
¶14.  Zimbabwe's Passport Fees Reduced...  Following a public outcry 
over exorbitant fees, the Home Affairs ministry instructed the 
Registrar-General to reduce passport fees from US$670 to US$170 for 
a standard passport, US$310 for a 24-hour passport and US$385 for an 
express passport. According to the co-ministers of Home Affairs, the 
new fees will continue to be reviewed downwards, as they remain 
higher than those of neighboring countries. 
 
¶15.  Activity Picks Up On the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE)... 
After months of very low trading on the local bourse, activity 
picked up strongly during the past eight days with most stocks 
recording significant gains.  According to Emmanuel Munyukwi, the 
CEO of the ZSE, this rise has been underpinned by the restoration of 
foreign trading of dual-listed companies.
