SUBJECT: TURKEY: IT'S OFFICIAL: FM GUL ANNOUNCES HIS 
PRESIDENTIAL BID 
 
REF: ANKARA 2072 
 
¶1. (U) FM Abdullah Gul submitted his presidential candidacy 
to parliament's new Speaker on August 14, formally opening 
his bid for the job as the ruling Justice and Development 
Party's (AKP) sole candidate.  After meeting with several 
opposition leaders, Gul told a press conference that, as 
president, he would uphold the constitution and strengthen 
the basic principles of the Turkish Republic.  He pointedly 
recited the key constitutional provisions  describing Turkey 
as a democratic, secular, social state governed by the rule 
of law.  He called the constitution his guide and promised to 
work for Turkey's unity.  He pledged to remain impartial, if 
elected, and to embrace and protect all Turks in accordance 
with Turkey's constitution.  Noting that he understands the 
"sensitivities" of state institutions, Gul said he would 
ensure they work harmoniously. 
 
¶2. (U) Gul told the press he could not ignore the people's 
message of support.  He had consulted with his family and his 
colleagues, including PM Erdogan, and felt obliged to keep 
his campaign promise to run.  He met with Nationalist Action 
Party (MHP) chair Devlet Bahceli earlier and would meet with 
other Turkish leaders. including labor organizations, in the 
coming days.  Although Republican People's Party (CHP) 
officials declined Gul's request for an appointment and have 
strongly opposed his candidacy, Gul said he would try to earn 
the support of all members of parliament.  He added that he 
would like to closely cooperate with CHP, along with other 
parties, if elected. 
 
¶3. (U) Gul stressed that, as president, he would continue to 
support efforts to open Turkey to the outside world.  He 
promised to work for greater democracy and respect for human 
rights, adding that he would promote Turkey's full EU 
membership.
