Dear Mr. President: 
 
Thank you for your leadership in working to resolve the 
political and humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe.  Even 
though the situation in Zimbabwe continues to 
deteriorate, Botswana's steadfast support for the rights 
of the Zimbabwean people and its recent contribution of 
3 million pula for humanitarian relief demonstrate the 
depth of your commitment.  The United States stands with 
Botswana and other partners in support of the Zimbabwean 
people during this critical time. 
 
I applaud your continued efforts in support of democracy 
and human rights in Zimbabwe. 
 
Sincerely, 
Condoleezza Rice
