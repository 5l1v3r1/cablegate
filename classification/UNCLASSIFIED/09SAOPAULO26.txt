Collective Selfishness 
 
Column in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (1-13) by guest 
journalist-columnist Mateus Soares de Azevedo states: "humiliated 
and offended Palestinians have been taken to the Gaza strip, 
expelled [to Gaza] by the new land owners, the Israeli 
Zionists....Zionism is a kind of 'collective selfishness'. For us 
[Zionists], everything; for others, nothing. If individual 
selfishness does not look pretty, imagine the collective 
[side].....To Support this war [in Gaza] is to justify its brutality 
and horrors; it's [the same as] being misled by [Zionist] 
propaganda."
