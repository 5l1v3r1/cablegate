Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  In 2003, OES sponsored and the Regional Environmental Hub 
organized an event on using remote sensing to help control the 
spread of infectious diseases.  A publication on the proceedings of 
the Interamerican Workshop on the Use of Remote Sensing to Control 
Infectious Diseases in the Americas has been recently published in 
English.  Copies can be obtained by contacting Diana Pinheiro 
Marinho of FIOCRUZ by e-mail at diana@ensp.fiocruz.br. End Summary 
 
¶2.  From November 19-21, 2003 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 84 
participants from 24 countries attended the first Interamerican 
Workshop on the Use of Remote Sensing to Control Infectious Diseases 
in the Americas.  U.S. institutions represented at the event were 
NASA, USGS, NIH, and USGS.  This event was organized by the Regional 
Environmental Hub and sponsored by the Bureau of Oceans, 
Environment, and Scientific Affairs of the U.S. Department of State, 
the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation - FIOCRUZ and the Inter American 
Institute for Global Change Research - IAI). 
 
¶3. This program provided participants with an overview of the use of 
satellite imagery in predicting and tracking disease.  Two speakers 
reported on research in the use of satellite imagery to predict 
outbreaks of malaria and to support a malaria early warning system 
in Africa.  There were also presentations on the use of satellite 
imagery to predict schistosomiasis in South America, to study the 
spread of leshmaniasis in Northeast Brazil, and to augment 
geographic information systems (GIS) in mapping Chagas disease and 
schistosomiasis on a fine scale (see reftel). 
 
¶4.  A book, a compilation of presentations made at the Rio de 
Janeiro workshop, has been recently published in English.  Professor 
Ulisses Confalonieri, the coordinator of the workshop and the editor 
of the book stated that for him it was "gratifying to testify that a 
network of Latin American participants who first met at the Rio 
Workshop was formed, as a direct outcome of the event, and they have 
already been able to organize two training courses in Chile and 
Argentina." 
 
¶5.  If you are interested in receiving a copy of the book, we invite 
you to contact Diana Pinheiro Marinho of FIOCRUZ by e-mail at 
diana@ensp.fiocruz.br for further information.
