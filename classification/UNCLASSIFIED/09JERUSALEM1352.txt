SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (08/05): Palestinians Hope Fatah 
Congress Restores Party's Luster 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
All dailies run prominent coverage of the Sixth Fatah Party Congress 
that opened in Bethlehem on August 4. The lead stories focused on 
Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas's speech 
delivered at the opening session. In their headlines, all dailies 
quote Abbas reiterating that "we seek peace; however, resistance 
will remain one of our choices." Abbas noted that Fatah is 
determined to have a successful national dialogue with Hamas and 
blamed the latter for the continued failure of these efforts. Abbas 
is quoted in Al-Ayyam stating that Palestinian national elections 
will be the last resort for ending the internal division and 
confirmed that the establishment of an independent Palestinian state 
is only a matter of time. Hamas spokesperson Mushir Al-Masri is 
quoted in Al-Quds saying that Abbas's remarks were "provocative and 
don't show any serious will toward achieving national 
reconciliation." 
 
The Israeli Minister of Information Yuli Edelstein is quoted in 
Al-Ayyam saying the Fatah conference is 
"A declaration of war against Israel" and noting that "Fatah members 
agree with continuing the armed resistance." Conversely, an unnamed 
Israeli official is quoted saying that the conference may be "an 
opportunity to pursue negotiations with the Palestinians." 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs front page coverage on Fatah Leader and 
Congress spokesman Nabil Amr noting in a press conference on August 
4 that Fatah will resort to elections as an alternative to "bloody 
disagreements." 
 
Al-Quds reports on its front page that the US is preparing to 
announce a plan for ending the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The 
report notes that President Obama and his advisors initiated this 
"peace plan" based on consultations with Arab states, Israel and the 
Palestinian Authority during the past several months. US sources 
noted that the plan will be announced after President Obama's 
meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Washington, DC on 
August 18. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages news citing Wafa News Agency that the 
European Union transferred 12.75 million Euro to the PA on August 4 
to pay civil service salaries. ------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Ashraf Ajrami opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title, "Will Fatah ever return" (08/05): "International and regional 
powers are waiting for Fatah to restore its status, as they believe 
it is almost impossible to have a peace process or negotiations 
without Fatah...the response is in Fatah's hands. Will it be able to 
meet this challenge and restore its status as the influential 
movement in the Palestinian political scene?" 
 
2) Hani Habib opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
headline "Fatah's resurrection, from Bethlehem" (08/05): "By holding 
the Fatah conference in the determined place and at the scheduled 
time proves Fatah's victory...Fatah was able to overcome all 
obstacles and hold the conference. By doing so, it gave all of its 
members and affiliates hope to achieve unity...we will wait to see 
e 
the outcome of this conference and, who knows, we may witness the 
 
JERUSALEM 00001352  002 OF 002 
 
 
rebirth of Fatah from Bethlehem!"
