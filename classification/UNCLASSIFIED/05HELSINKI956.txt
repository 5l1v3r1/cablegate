Â¶1.  (U)  Anne Lammila, the Director for Latin America at 
Finland's MFA, told Poloff that Finland will not send a 
national electoral observation mission to Haiti.  It is 
possible that a Finn might participate in the EU observation 
mission; but there are few French-speaking Finnish diplomats 
available, and Lammila thought it unlikely any Finn would be 
selected.
