¶1. (SBU) In a November 9 meeting with Public Prosecutor Abdel 
Meguid Mahmoud (Egypt's Attorney General equivalent), the 
Ambassador noted continuing USG attention to religious 
freedom issues.  While stressing U.S. respect for the 
Egyptian legal framework and the overall sensitivity of the 
topic, the Ambassador flagged American interest in the 
November 20 Supreme Administrative Court hearing of the GOE's 
appeal of an April 4 lower court ruling that ordered the GOE 
to allow Bahai's to list their religion on their national 
identity cards (Ref A). (Note: Under current Egyptian law, 
citizens can list their religious affiliation on ID cards 
only with one of the three "heavenly" faiths - Muslim, 
Christian, or Jew. End note.)  The Ambassador noted his hope 
that the GOE would devise a workable and just solution to the 
problem of compelling citizens to list religion on ID cards, 
which causes problems for Bahai's as well as Muslims who seek 
to convert from Islam.  Mahmoud did not directly respond to 
the Ambassador's comments, but clearly understood the 
importance the USG places on religious freedom issues. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador and Mahmoud also discussed continuing 
USG-GOE cooperation on TIP-related issues, and the imminent 
creation of an inter-ministerial GOE committee to coordinate 
the fight against TIP (reported Ref B).  Mahmoud asserted 
that the placing of Egypt on the TIP Tier 2 Watch List is 
"unjust" and "unfounded." He also highlighted that Egypt is 
strictly a transit country, not a country of origin or 
destination for trafficked persons.
