REF: STATE 49212 
 
We sent reftel message to Francisco Arana Landa, Subdirector 
General for Nuclear Energy in the Ministry of Economy.  Arana 
told us March 18 that due to the impending change of 
government (the Socialist party ousted the incumbent Popular 
Party in the March 14 general elections), the current 
administration could offer no pledges of support for the 
Chornobyl Shelter Fund at this time.  Post will contact Arana 
once the new government is in place, perhaps by early May, to 
revisit this issue.
