KINPO INTERNATIONAL LTD. 
 
REF: A) USDOC 04811 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the Bureau of 
Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control Officer 
(ECO) Philip Ankel conducted a post shipment 
verification (PSV) of Kinpo International Ltd. (Kinpo 
H.K.) on October 12, 2006. This PSV concerned a tri- 
axis accelerometer exported by Kionix Inc. (Kionix) of 
Ithaca, New York, classified as 7A994 (controlled for 
anti-terrorism reasons) and valued at $10,456. 
 
¶3. An extract from the Hong Kong Companies Registry 
provides that Kinpo H.K. was dissolved as a commercial 
entity in March 1998 and is no longer in existence. 
No further information concerning this company was 
available from the Companies Registry. 
 
¶4.  The contact information in the Kionix invoice 
provided by OEA led to the following results:  A visit 
to the Kinpo H.K. address (13 Argyle Street, Room 
2309-10, Hong Kong) listed in the "bill to" portion of 
the invoice revealed that Kinpo was not located at 
that address.  Rather, that location housed another 
company "Win Global Electrical Appliance Ltd."  Calls 
by the commercial assistant to the contact person in 
the "ship to" portion of the Kionix invoice, Mr. 
Terence Fung, revealed that Mr. Fung actually works 
for a company called Soonest Express, a freight 
forwarder. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Fung confirmed that Soonest Express had 
received the applicable item from Kionix on May 1, 
2006 and had forwarded it to Kinpo International Ltd. 
in Dong Guan, China (Kinpo China) on May 6, 2006.  Mr. 
Fung stated that Soonest Express no longer acts as a 
freight forwarder for Kinpo China.  Ms. Emily Zhang of 
Kinpo China's purchasing department in Dong Guan 
confirmed that Kinpo China had received the applicable 
item from Kionix (via freight forwarder Soonest 
Express in Hong Kong). 
 
¶6.  Kinpo's web site (www.kinpo.com.tw) provides 
greater background about this Taiwan based company. 
Begin Quote: Kinpo has established itself as a front 
runner in Taiwan's electronics industry since 1973. 
After thirty years' hard working, Kinpo diversifies 
its product lines from basic electronic calculators at 
one end, a wide range of 3C consumer electronics in 
between, and to internet application products at the 
other.  To date, Kinpo has a staff of more than 10,000 
employees worldwide. Under its current global 
corporate structure, Kinpo places its corporate 
management center and R&D design facilities in Taiwan, 
software development centers in Shanghai and Beijing, 
mass production facilities in Dongguan, and 
manufacturing supports in Thailand. End quote. 
 
¶7. Given the information noted above, the ECO 
recommends that this PSV of Kinpo H.K. be categorized 
as Unfavorable.  However, it should be noted that the 
item in question (if properly classified) may be 
exported to Hong Kong and reexported to China "no 
license required" (NLR).  As such, the ECO suggests 
that the "Unfavorable" recommendation not be applied 
to Kinpo's operations in other countries.
