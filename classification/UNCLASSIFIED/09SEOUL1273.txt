SUBJECT: ROKG HAS BEGUN DISBURSING PLEDGED SUPPORT FOR 
SOMALIA 
 
REF: STATE 79853 
 
¶1. (U) In response to reftel request to urge the host 
government to provide previously pledged funds for Somalia, 
Song Hye-ryoung, MOFAT Humanitarian Assistance Division, on 
August 11 said the Republic of Korea (ROKG) has already begun 
disbursing funds from the USD 1,500,000 pledged at the Donors 
Conference held in Brussels on April 22 for the Somalia 
Security Sector and African Union Mission in Somalia 
(AMISOM).  According to Song, the pledged funds will be 
divided accordingly: USD 500,000 allocated to AMISOM and USD 
1,000,000 to humanitarian assistance, of which USD 600,000 
has already been disbursed through donations to the World 
Food Program in Somalia.  The ROKG expects to release the 
remaining funds in the next couple of months. 
 
¶2. (U) Song also said that a very small amount of the funds 
have also been used for a coastal security management 
program, which brought several African (including Somali) 
officers to Korea for training.  Song did not know the exact 
dates of the training, but said it occurred around May or 
June of this year. 
 
¶3. (U) Song added that the ROKG gave USD 3 million this year 
to the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund, which allocates 
disaster relief funds to countries in emergency, including 
Somalia.  The ROKG does not currently donate money directly 
to the Transitional Federal Government (TFG).  Song said the 
overall level of financial support for Somalia next year is 
estimated to total approximately USD 2.5 million, depending 
on the budget, with a projected minimum allocation of USD 
1.25 million.
