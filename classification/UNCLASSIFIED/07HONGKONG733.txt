REF: A) USDOC 00994 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), 
accompanied by Commercial Assistant, Sandy Lai, conducted a post 
shipment verification (PSV) at Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials 
Asia Limited (Rohm & Haas), 15 On Lok Mun Street, New Territories, 
Hong Kong.  The items in question are 31 drums of EBR-10A Edge Bead 
Remover valued at USD 12,666.  No export control classification 
number (ECCN) was included on the relevant shipping documents 
although related documentation provided by OEA states that the items 
are classified as EAR99 (subject to the Export Administration 
Regulations but not separately listed on the Commerce Control List). 
 Items properly classified as EAR99 may be exported/reexported to 
virtually all destinations and end-users worldwide, license free. 
The exporter is Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials LLC of 
Marlborough, Massachusetts. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Rohm and Haas has 
been in existence since 1979 (originally incorporated as Lea-Ronal 
(S.E. Asia) Limited.  A review of the relevant website 
(www.electronicmaterials.rohmhaas.com) indicates that the company is 
an affiliate of Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials LLC in 
Marlborough, Massachusetts (the exporter).  The Hong Kong Rohm and 
Haas affiliateQs main business is importation and exportation of 
electroplating chemicals for PCB boards, resistors and other 
electronic components. 
 
¶4.  The ECO, accompanied by Commercial Assistant, Sandy Lai visited 
Rohm and Haas at the address referenced above on March 7, 2007 and 
met with Grace S.K. Cheung, Trade Compliance Specialist, Asia 
Pacific.  She provided background on Rohm and Haas and its business 
as well as its worldwide and Hong Kong specific compliance program. 
 
 
¶5.  Ms. Cheung provided a spreadsheet of the various customers for 
the applicable chemicals.  She was not able to provide documentation 
on the specific customers that received the particular shipment in 
question because the chemicals were ordered for stock and delivered 
to customers as they purchased them.  Customers listed on the 
spreadsheet provided by Ms. Cheung included CR Semiconductor, CSMC 
Technologies, Daily Silver Imp Micrelectron, Hunan Puzhao 
Information, RCL Semiconductor, Ltd., Shanghai Epic Music 
Entertainment, Shanghai SIM-BCD Semiconductor, Shijaizhuang Concord 
Electronics, Tianjin Zhonghuan Semiconductor, and Wuxi Zhongwei 
Microchips Co. 
 
¶6.  Ms. Cheung is quite familiar with U.S. and Hong Kong export 
controls (as her title would suggest).  She had met the ECO at the 
recent BIS/MOFCOM seminar on export controls.  She stressed that 
Rohm and Haas has a strong worldwide export compliance program that 
makes use of SAP and Global Trade Solutions software. She stated 
that she is part of the companyQs global compliance network and her 
regional supervisor is located in Singapore. 
 
¶7. At the time visited, Rohm and Haas appeared to be a suitable 
recipient of the chemicals in question since Rohm and Haas 
cooperated with the PSV and provided all requested information 
concerning the final disposition of the items.  At the same time, 
the ECO was not able to inspect the subject items as they had 
already been delivered to the customers of Rohm and Haas or put into 
stock. Consistent with guidance on reporting of PSVs where the items 
cannot be physically inspected, the ECO recommends that this PSV be 
classified as Limited.
