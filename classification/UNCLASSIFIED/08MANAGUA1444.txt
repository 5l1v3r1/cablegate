SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. In November 2008, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) resolved one Embassy registered property claim. The Embassy's database now consists of 616 unresolved registered property claims belonging to 293 Amcits. To date, the overwhelming majority of resolutions have involved compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs). As of November 30, 2008, the GON had issued BPIs with a face value of $334,156,014.76 to Embassy-registered claimants. Since taking office in January 2007, the Ortega administration has resolved 57 claims, ten of which during the 2008-2009 waiver year.
 
EMBASSY REGISTERED CLAIMS RESOLVED IN OCTOBER 
--------------------------------------------- 

¶2. On November 7, 2008, Attorney General Hernan Estrada provided the Embassy a copy of the final settlement document or "finiquito" signed on October 27, 2008, by U.S. citizen Josefina Sanchez. Mrs. Sanchez' had received a check for $150,000 from the Central Bank of Nicaragua on July 12, 1979, but was unable to cash before the Sandinistas took control of the government. Her claim has languished ever since. On October 27, she received BPIs worth 1,525,000 cordobas, approximately $77,203. We have updated our database to reflect this settlement.
