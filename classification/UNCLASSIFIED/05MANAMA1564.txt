PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND JUSTIFICATION 
Project Name: Muslim-American Calligrapher in Bahrain 
Project Description: Muslim-American Calligrapher visits 
Bahrain to display calligraphic artwork at local arts and 
religious institutions, conduct workshops with local 
calligraphers, and speak on the topic of Islamic culture in 
America. 
 
MPP Goals: Combating Terrorism, Democracy, Mutual 
Understanding, Information Resources 
Project Objectives and Relationships to MPP Goals above: 
This project will bring the artwork and perspective of an 
accomplished Muslim-American calligrapher to broad audiences 
among Bahraini artists, museum professionals, academics, 
students and youth. Our specific goals are: 
 
¶1. Increase mutual understanding by educating target 
communities about Islam and Muslims in America, and by 
illustrating the prevalence of and respect for Muslims and 
Islamic art in America. 
 
¶2. Engage academics in dialogue about the role of religious 
freedom and tolerance in American society. (Comment: This is 
especially important given Bahrain's sectarian challenge of 
harmonizing divisions between Sunni and Shia sects.) 
 
¶3. Educate Bahraini artists and curators about cutting edge 
techniques in calligraphy that are practiced by accomplished 
American artists.
