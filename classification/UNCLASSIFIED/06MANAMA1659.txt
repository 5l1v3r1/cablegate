DCM delivered follow up demarche (Ref A) September 14 to MFA 
Assistant Undersecretary for Coordination and Follow Up 
Shaikh Abdul Aziz Bin Mubarak Al Khalifa regarding the 
candidacy of Steven Lett for the position of head of the 
International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO).  Shaikh 
Abdul Aziz asked about other candidates for the position, and 
the DCM shared that information.  Shaikh Abdul Aziz said that 
he had not seen a response from the Ministry of 
Transportation, which has authority over satellite 
communication matters in Bahrain, but would contact us after 
consulting them.
