SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR ENGAGES UAE ARABIC MEDIA TO CORRECT 
MISPERCEPTIONS ON U.S. EFFORTS IN HAITI 
 
REF: ABU DHABI 96 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY: Ambassador Olson granted two interviews to UAE 
Arabic media on January 21, 2010 to provide an accurate view of 
U.S. and global assistance to Haiti, in the aftermath of the 
earthquake in Haiti.  The interviews also served to correct 
misperceptions about the U.S. role in Haiti, specifically as 
reported in a January 20, 2010 article in Sharjah-based Arabic 
daily Al Khaleej, entitled "Haiti comes under militarization and 
its children become slaves".  The interviews resulted in positive 
and more accurate coverage of U.S. efforts in Haiti in local Arabic 
and English press.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U) Following up on limited negative reporting on U.S. efforts 
in Haiti in the local media, Ambassador Olson called the Editor of 
Al-Khaleej newspaper to complain about biased coverage, then 
subsequently gave a television interview to Abu Dhabi TV and a 
print interview to Emirates News Agency (WAM) - the official UAE 
news agency - on January 21, 2010.  The television interview was 
dubbed into Arabic, and the print interview appeared in both 
English and Arabic publications. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) In both interviews the Ambassador discussed the U.S. 
response to the earthquake in Haiti, highlighting that the United 
States is responding to an invitation from the Haitian Government 
to assist.  He emphasized that the U.S. is acting in cooperation 
with international aid efforts and in close coordination with the 
Haitian Government, United Nations, and global community.  To 
correct inaccurate coverage of U.S. activities in Haiti that 
appeared in a January 20, 2010 article in Sharjah-based Arabic 
daily Al Khaleej (REFTEL), the Ambassador emphasized the 
humanitarian nature of U.S. activities and clarified the U.S. role 
in rehabilitating the airport and facilitating entry to the United 
States for Haitian children.  The Ambassador also praised UAE 
contributions to Haiti, commending the UAEG on their assistance. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U) The Ambassador's comments received positive coverage in 
both local Arabic and English press.  Abu Dhabi TV ran a three 
minute story in the local news and main evening newscasts on 
January 21, 2010.  Positive coverage of the Ambassador's interview 
with WAM was prominent in articles in Abu Dhabi-based Arabic daily 
"Al Ittihad", Abu Dhabi-based Arabic daily "Akhbar Al Arab", 
Dubai-based English Daily "Gulf News", and Sharjah-based English 
Daily "The Gulf Today".  Most significantly, Al Khaleej ran a 
second story based on the Ambassador's WAM interview that offered a 
more accurate view of the U.S. role in Haiti. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (U) The Embassy and Consulate General will continue to monitor 
UAE media coverage on U.S. aid efforts in Haiti and follow up as 
required.
