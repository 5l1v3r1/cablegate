Economic Crisis Affects 190,000 Workers in Turkey 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports a survey commissioned by 
Allied Metal Workers' Union says some employers see the global 
economic crisis as "an opportunity to layoff workers."  The survey 
shows total employment was reduced by 44,000 jobs in October 2008, 
including the job losses in the construction sector.  The metal and 
ready-wear sectors were affected most by the crisis.  In October, 
9,000 registered workers lost their jobs in Istanbul, 7,000 in 
Izmir, 6,000 in Bursa, and 2,000 in Aydin and Kocaeli, according to 
the survey. 
 
"Savagery" (Sabah) 
Media outlets unanimously criticize Israel's ground invasion into 
Gaza with sensational headlines.  Particular attention is paid to 
the "baby-killing" aspect of the story, as TVs and papers use 
sensational headlines and photos of Palestinian children who were 
either injured or killed during the operations.  Leftist Taraf 
carries the headline, "Israel Goes Completely Mad over Its Fear of 
Obama," as "Israel launches ground operations into Gaza during the 
few remaining days of the Bush administration, its ally." 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak carries the headline, "Divide and 
Destroy," as "Cluster bombs are used and the world just sits back 
and watches," but "Turkey Curses This Barbarism."  Mainstream Vatan 
uses the headline, "Humanitarian Drama," as "Once again, the U.S. 
supports Israel at the U.N.," while "Israel hits everything, 
including ambulances."  Islamist-oriented Zaman reports, "Gaza Weeps 
Blood," and reports, "Norwegian doctors have found uranium in some 
of the bodies of the dead (from depleted-uranium ordinance)." 
Liberal Radikal reports, "Israeli Tanks Move into the Belly of 
Gaza."  Mainstream Milliyet reports, "Death Rains on Civilians in 
Gaza."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports, "Israel Burns Gaza," 
as "Turkey's role as a mediator is proposed by some in the Western 
press, including David Ignatius of the Washington Post." 
 
Columnists predict Israel will pay for its actions in Gaza for a 
long time to come.  Ferai Tinc wrote in mainstream Hurriyet, "Israel 
wants to take Gaza completely out of Hamas' control.  In the end 
however, the Israeli operations will legitimize Hamas even more than 
ever before."  Ergin Yildizoglu wrote in leftist-nationalist 
Cumhuriyet, "Israel hopes to get rid of Hamas before Bush leaves 
office, but the current Israeli attack is providing more fuel to 
radicalism especially in Iran, Syria and Palestine."  Tamer Korkmaz 
wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "Israel, which attacks 
mosques and kills children, is a terrorist state and its sponsor is 
the United States."  Ceyda Karan wrote in liberal-intellectual 
Radikal, "Even if Israel defeats Hamas, this will not help 
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas get politically stronger.  Future 
steps toward peace will always be overshadowed by Israeli's actions, 
which will provide an advantage to Hamas regardless of the 
situation."  Omer Taspinar wrote in mainstream Sabah: "Obama will 
continue to support Israel, but unlike the Bush administration, he 
is expected to make diplomatic inroads toward the main 
Israel-rejecting bloc, namely Iran and Syria." 
 
 
"Noteworthy Donations" 
 
Ordu MHP Deputy Ridvan Yalcin made a formal request to the 
government about the financing of several Turkish foundations.  In 
response, the Deputy Prime Minister and State Minister in charge of 
foundations, Hayati Yazici, presented a list of 39 foundations and 
donations to them from foreign sources including the EU, the U.S. 
and Japan.  Mainstream Milliyet reports that often, foreign actors 
are thought to use their financial support to manipulate in the 
domestic agendas of certain countries through financial support.  In 
addition, Milliyet notes that 39 private non-profit foundations in 
Turkey receive upwards of $40 million aid from foreign charity 
organizations and foreign government institutes.  Milliyet notes

that the U.S. Embassy in Ankara gave $129,000 to the Ensar 
Foundation, which is known for its Islamist religious activities and 
$175,000 to the Open Society Institute (TESEV), which was formed by 
George Soros.  The U.S. Embassy also donated $12,280 to 
International Blue Crescent Humanitarian Aid and Development 
Foundation.
