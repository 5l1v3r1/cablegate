¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Bolstered by external demand, domestic 
security gains, and pro-investment terms, Colombia's mining 
and hydrocarbon sector has experienced an unprecedented 
increase in investment and exploration activities. Petroleum 
production has reached a six-year high while coal and natural 
gas production are at record production levels.  Meanwhile, 
foreign investment and new bloc offerings by the GOC are 
driving exploration efforts at the fastest pace in Colombian 
history.  Exploration in non-fuel mineral, such as gold and 
uranium, has experienced a similar boom. END SUMMARY. 

High Prices and Improving Conditions Drive Production 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 

¶2. (U) In an April 25 interview with leading economic daily 
Portafolio, Minister of Mines and Energy Hernan Martinez 
characterized Colombia as experiencing a "revolution" in its 
mining sector as a result of high commodity prices, a strong 
global demand outlook, and strong inflows of investment in 
the sector.  All three factors, as well as increased access 
to exploration areas due to improved security, have fueled 
mineral and hydrocarbon exports over the last year. 
¶3. (SBU) According to Colombia's statistical agency, DANE, 
mineral sector exports (including hydrocarbons) reached USD 
13.9 billion in 2007 or 46 percent of total exports. 
Revenues from 2007 exceeded those in 2006 by 19 percent.  So 
far in 2008, export revenues in the sector have grown an 
additional 75 percent in comparison to the same period in 
2007 and totaled 54 percent of total exports. Similarly, the 
Colombian Central Bank reported in April that approximately 
one-half of Colombia's record USD 9 billion in foreign direct 
investment (FDI) in 2007 went to the mineral/hydrocarbon 
sector.  Representatives from producer companies and the GOC 
tell us the increased investment derives from not only higher 
commodity prices, but also improved security in exploration 
areas and pro-investment policies by the GOC (ref A). 

Oil: Aggressive Exploration 
--------------------------- 

¶4. (SBU) The petroleum sector has demonstrated the clearest 
trend, with new inflows of FDI and new investment by 
partially privatized national hydrocarbons company Ecopetrol
reversing a long-term decline in exploration efforts. 
Current daily production has risen to 570,000 barrels per day 
(bpd), Colombia's highest rate since 2002.   So far most of 
the production increase has derived from squeezing more oil 
from mature fields, but new exploration efforts have ramped 
up in the last year.  According to the Colombian National 
Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) the number of new wells drilled in 
2008 will reach 90, up from only 21 in 2004.  The 2008 
estimate represents the highest annual total of new wells in 
Colombian history.  The GOC auctioned nine offshore blocs in 
late 2007 and has begun the process for auctioning as many as 
150 onshore blocs later this year.  The prospective blocs lie 
near the Venezuelan border and the GOC believes offer strong 
prospects for development of heavy oil deposits. 

Coal: Ensuring Infrastructure to Increase Exports 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 

¶5. (SBU) Colombian coal production has also boomed over the 
last year, driven by the same factors as the petroleum 
sector.   The combined production of conglomerate Cerrejon
mines, U.S.-based Drummond, and Swiss-owned Glencore, should 
reach 110 million tons by 2010, up from 38 million tons in 
2000 (ref B).  Representatives from all three companies tell 
us proven deposits are sufficient to maintain this level of 
production through 2030.  Rather than discovering new 
deposits, all three companies have identified adequate 
transportation and port infrastructure as the primary export 
constraint for the sector.  Likewise, the companies are 
currently engaged in discussions with the GOC regarding 
environmental requirements to shift to direct-loading port 
operations by 2010, which they fear could impact export 
capacity. 

Opportunities in Natural Gas, Gold, and Uranium 
--------------------------------------------- -- 

¶6.  (SBU) In addition to oil and coal, Minister Martinez and 
other GOC officials tout prospects in gas, gold, and uranium. 
 Private sector firms, including Chevron and Drummond, have 
expressed to us confidence that Colombia has several strong 
prospective gas fields.  Natural gas production has risen 18 
percent already in 2008 to 862 million cubic feet according 
to ANH and the GOC expects several new offshore Caribbean 
wells to come online by the end of the year.  Colombia began 
shipping gas via a new pipeline to Venezuela in January 2008 
and recently announced plans to triple the original planned 
daily amount of 50 million cubic feet.  Besides increased 
natural gas exports to Venezuela, the number of Colombian 
consumers using natural gas has nearly doubled since 2002 to 
4.6 million (or roughly 10 percent of the population), 
creating for the first time in Colombian history a sizable 
domestic market for gas. 

¶7. (U) Meanwhile, an influx of foreign firms, many of them 
Canadian, are actively pursuing exploration for gold and 
other minerals in Antioquia, Caldas, Choco, Santander, and 
Vaupes Departments.  On May 12, Toronto-based Colombia 
Goldfields announced preliminary results of mining samples 
from the Zona Alta field in Marmato, Caldas, indicating 
deposits of up to 2.6 million ounces of gold.  The company 
described the findings as the first step in confirming 
Marmato Mountain as a world-class gold deposit  In addition 
to gold exploration, the Mines and Energy Ministry has issued 
26 licenses for uranium exploration since the beginning of 
¶2007.
