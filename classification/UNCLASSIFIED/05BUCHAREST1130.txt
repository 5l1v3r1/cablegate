SUBJECT:  INTERNAL TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND END USER 
AGREEMENT FOR ROMANIAN ARMAMENT DONATION TO THE AFGHAN 
NATIONAL ARMY 
 
¶1.  The Embassy Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) received 
a letter dated May 4 from the Romanian Ministry of National 
Defense addressed to ODC regarding Romania's offer to donate 
armaments to the Afghan National Army.  Post notes that the 
MOD letter states that the GOR cannot pay for the "internal 
transportation" cost of the armaments, estimated at USD 
35,520, nor "handling costs" at the airport of shipment. 
The letter also underscores that the GOR requires an end 
user certificate from the Afghans.  The text of the letter 
is in Romanian and Post's informal translation of the letter 
follows:

To Mr. LTC IRA C. QUEEN 
CHIEF OF THE OFFICE FOR DEFENCE COOPERATION 
 
 
The Romanian Ambassador to Washington, Mr. Sorin Ducaru, has 
sent us Diplomatic Note nr. 043/2005 from the US Embassy in 
Bucharest, which provides notice of the agreement for the 
donation and informs us that you and Mr. Christopher Palmer 
are the contact persons at the US Embassy. 
 
At the same time, [America] inquires about the possibility 
of [Romania] covering the costs of the internal 
transportation of the donation, to the airport of shipment 
and whether the armament should be taken from another 
location. 
 
In this regard, we would like to ask you to communicate to 
the Embassy the following: 
- the airport of shipment is the International Airport 
"Mihail Kogalniceanu"; 
- the armaments are currently in the Targoviste garrison, 
located 350 kilometers from the airport; [Embassy Note: The 
reference to "the airport" refers to the Mihail Kogalniceanu 
airport near the city of Constanta.  The distance between 
the cities of Constanta and Targoviste is more than 300 
kilometers.  End Embassy Note.] 
- the armaments will be shipped to a location five 
kilometers from the airport, one or two days before the 
airplane arrives and will remain there until boarding; 
- Romania can cover neither the costs of the internal 
transportation of the armament estimated at USD 35,520 
(according to the annex), nor the handling costs at the 
airport of shipment; 
- Romania cannot initiate the procedure of promoting a 
government decision to approve the donation, unless it 
receives the end user certificate from the Afghan 
government.  The certificate in original is necessary for 
the issuance of the export license; 
- the details regarding the dimensions of the donation are 
in conformity with the annex.  Annex: one page, 
unclassified.
