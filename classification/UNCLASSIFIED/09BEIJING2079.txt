¶1. ENVIRONMENT 
 
"'Post-crisis' economy has a new engine: green industries" 
 
The official Communist Party international paper, People's Daily 
Overseas Edition (Renmin Ribao Haiwaiban) (07/21):" Zhong Maochu, a 
professor at Nankai University's Graduate School of Economics said 
various indications show that America and other developed countries 
are actively laying pieces out to create a game in their favor.  The 
U.S. is pushing the world to adopt "clean energy" as the engine of 
economic growth.  The U.S.'s ultimate goal is to gain a dominate 
position this new round of economic competition.  Zhong said the 
wave of "green economy" is irreversible so China needs to take the 
initiative to participate in the research and development of core 
technologies and standard setting.  Zhong is also concerned that 
"clean energy" or "the green economy" will become a new mode of 
economic growth and treated like IT technology and financial 
innovation, which are merely tools of high profits and high growth. 
China needs to be aware that developed countries including the U.S. 
are seeking a monopoly in this new game.  China should help form a 
fair system to prevent developed countries exploiting developing 
countries. " 
 
 
¶2. MILITARY 
 
"The first island chain cannot lock in the Chinese Navy" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/21): "As the Chinese Navy develops, the 
U.S. and Japanese illusion of being "the first island chain" in the 
western Pacific becomes stronger and stronger.  They always have 
this "illusion of containment."   "The first island chain" is 
completely a Cold War product by the Americans.  It refers to a 
curved line hemming in China that runs from Japan through Taiwan, 
the Philippines and on to Indonesia.  During the Cold War it was 
regarded as the U.S.'s first line of defense.  This idea is 
poisonous to Eastern Asia's security atmosphere and this illusion, 
so full of hostility, has become a major obstacle for a new security 
landscape in this region.  "The first island chain" will not stop 
China from maintaining its strategic goal of national unity.  The 
U.S.- Japan alliance should get accustomed to the development of the 
Chinese Navy.  According to scholar Gao Hong, "The first island 
chain" can only increase the confidence of the alliance and nothing 
more. " 
 
¶3. RUSSIA 
 
"Central and Eastern European countries are concerned over the 
"resumption" of the U.S.-Russia relationship" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao) (07/21): "In the view of Central and Eastern European 
countries, the Obama Administration is no longer supportive of 
Ukrainian and Georgian efforts to join NATO because America wants to 
pacify Russia.  The U.S. is actually taking Central and Eastern 
European nations' concerns into account.  The U.S. won't give in to 
Russian pressure and through this gesture hopefully Central and 
Eastern European nations won't feel abandoned.  U.S. Vice President 
Biden's visit to Ukraine and Georgia is also aimed at consoling 
their morale.  The interruption of Central and Eastern Europe- U.S. 
relations is to Russia's advantage.  As a result, Russia made a 
series of compromises during Obama's visit to Moscow.  Whether they 
like it or not, the "resumption" of Russia- U.S. relationship is a 
hard fact that Central and Eastern European countries have to 
accept. "
