¶1. The Spanish parliament passed the 2005 General Budget 
December 22 with an absolute majority over the Senate's veto. 
 The budget passed with a vote of 180 to 162.  The parties 
voting in favor of the budget were the Socialists, the 
Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), the United Left (IU), the 
Canary Coalition and the Aragonist Council.  Nafaroa Bai, 
Eusko Alkartasuna, the Galician Nationalist Party, the Basque 
Nationalist Party and Catalonia,s Convergence and Union 
joined the opposition Popular Party, in voting against the 
government,s budget. 
 
¶2. Comment: The budget's passage ends the three month effort 
of the opposition Popular Party to embarrass Zapatero's 
Socialist government.  Though 2005 marks the first time that 
the budget was returned to the lower house to override a 
Senate veto, the government will suffer very little in terms 
of political capital or loss of legitimacy.
