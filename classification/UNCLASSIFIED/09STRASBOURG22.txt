SUBJECT: COUNCIL OF EUROPE:  PRIORITIES IN ARMENIA 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Several Council of Europe (COE) ambassadors have 
pointed to COE programs and influence in Armenia as one of the 
COE's success stories.  Our contacts, including the Armenian 
Ambassador, have highlighted a positive COE role, including the 
COE's Parliamentary Assembly's (PACE) enhanced monitoring of 
Armenia until early this year, in influencing Armenian 
authorities to address several (but not all) issues related to 
the violence surrounding last year's election.  They readily 
acknowledge that pressure from Brussels, Washington, and other 
capitals have also helped generate reforms in Yerevan. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U) The draft COE Action Plan (drafted in consultation with 
Armenian authorities) with Armenia for 2009-11 focuses on 
supporting Yerevan's fulfillment of its COE accession 
commitments and statutory obligations.  Its prioritized areas 
include: 
 
 
 
the functioning of the judiciary 
 
 
 
freedom of expression and of the media 
 
 
 
electoral legislation and implementation 
 
 
 
fight against ill-treatment and impunity 
 
 
 
penitentiary reform and the fight against corruption 
 
 
 
follow-up to constitutional reform through legal-cooperation. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) The agreement notes that the EU-Armenia Action Plan was 
adopted under the European Neighborhood Policy in November 2006 
to help Armenian meet the targets set by the European Union with 
the help of Council of Europe expertise, including on 
strengthening the application of the European Convention on 
Human Rights at the national level. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Armenian Ambassador told us recently that the 
agreement with the COE has not yet received Yerevan's blessing, 
largely because of disagreements over some definitions of 
individual projects.  He noted that the agreement should include 
8.1 million Euros for financing.  Some of the budget will come 
from the COE, some (including almost all of the 4.1 million 
Euros for an "Access to justice" project) from joint programs 
with the EU, and some from voluntary contributions.
