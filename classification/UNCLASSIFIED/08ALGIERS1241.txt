REF: STATE 123081 
 
We delivered reftel demarche to MFA Chief of Disarmament and 
Nonproliferation Fethi Metref during a November 23 meeting in 
which we urged Algeria to abstain or vote against UNGA 
resolutions that contain an anti-Israel bias.  Metref 
received the demarche without comment; however, he assured us 
that his colleagues in multilateral affairs would contact us 
regarding any subsequent response.  Given the Algerians' 
support for such resolutions in the past, and their general 
position on Palestine, we have no reason to believe that 
Algeria will support the U.S. either in opposing or 
abstaining from votes concerning resolutions with an 
anti-Israel bias.
