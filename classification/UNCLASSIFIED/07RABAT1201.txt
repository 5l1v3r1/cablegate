MEPI VISITORS 
------------- 
 
¶2.  NEA's PDAS Scott Carpenter visited Morocco June 4-7 to meet with 
GOM officials, civil society leaders and several MEPI recipients. 
Morocco's upcoming elections and the issue of press freedom 
dominated discussions which also included judicial reform, the 
importance of civil society organizations and youth programs.  He 
had a wide-ranging meeting with the MFA's Director of Bilateral 
Affairs Yousef Amrani; reviewed election issues with prominent 
female leaders, MEPI recipients and civil society advocates; 
discussed the issue of press freedom with the Minister of 
Communications Nabil Benabdellah and prominent journalists; met with 
the American Bar Association; and visited a youth center in an under 
privileged neighborhood of Rabat to discuss a number of issues 
affecting the lives of its members.  It was a successful visit that 
featured extensively in a FACT DVC between Washington and Mission 
Morocco on June 28. 
 
¶3.  MEPI's Senior Grant Officer Anna Mary Portz visited Rabat from 
March 13-17.  She conducted monitoring activities with MEPI 
implementers MTDS-Tanmia and Demos Consulting and met with the 
International Financial Corporation.  She also discussed MEPI 
programs and ways to improve coordination and communication between 
posts, MEPI regional offices and Washington. 
 
¶4.  Chad Bettes from NEA/PI visited Morocco from May 15-18 to 
officially launch the MEPI Alumni Network.  He met with members of 
the Network's steering committee and MEPI alumni to review the 
network's goals and to discuss next steps and work coordination.  He 
also met with the Alumni Coordinator and the Director of the 
America-Mideast Educational and Training Services, Inc. (AMIDEAST). 
The MEPI Alumni Network will include quarterly activities, an online 
hub with information about financial opportunities, and provide 
opportunities to remain in contact with other MEPI alumni in the 
region. 
 
------------------------- 
TWO NEW MEPI SMALL GRANTS 
------------------------- 
 
¶5.  In May, post approved two new MEPI small grants to NGOs totaling 
$45,349.  Both pertain to the political pillar.  The first 
recipient, Al Akhawayn University, will conduct a survey to assess 
public opinion towards political institutions, and economic and 
social conditions in Morocco.  The second, Association Action 
Jeunesse, seeks to increase awareness of the importance of political 
participation among Moroccan youth, especially in light of the 
country's upcoming elections. 
 
----------------------- 
THE MEPI ALUMNI NETWORK 
----------------------- 
 
¶6. On April 6, the MEPI Alumni Network was established in Morocco as 
well as in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Yemen.  The MEPI Alumni 
Network facilitated by AMIDEAST, is designed to accelerate the 
momentum of organizations working to advance reforms and bring 
increased peace and prosperity to the people of the Middle East and 
North Africa.  A steering committee was formed to provide leadership 
and vision for the Alumni Network.  The members represent the 
diversity of MEPI pillars; they are business CEOs, women's rights 
activists, student leaders, political candidates and community 
reformers.  Ambassador Riley participated in a July 13 event that 
launched the steering committee's work plan.

THE RIGHT TO ACCESS INFORMATION 
 
RABAT 00001201  002 OF 003 
 
 
------------------------------- 
 
¶7. The International Research & Exchanges Board (IREX) funded a 
workshop in Marrakech on May 26-27 entitled "Media, Administration 
and the Right to Access Information in Morocco."  The event, 
organized by the MEPI-funded Moroccan association Adala (Justice), 
attracted 26 participants including: two MPs, a representative from 
the Ministry of Public Sector Modernization, lawyers, journalists, 
civil society members and human rights leaders.  A member of 
parliament from the USFP (socialist party), Fatima Belmoudden, 
presented a proposal for a draft law promoting access to 
information.  Participants offered feedback on how to improve the 
proposal before presenting it to parliament. 
 
------------------------------------ 
NEW GUIDES TO PROMOTE WOMEN'S RIGHTS 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶8. The Moroccan legal landscape was enriched by the introduction of 
two new practical guides designed to promote women's rights. 
MEPI-funded Global Rights, working with local NGOs, recently 
completed two publications titled "Promoting Access to Justice for 
Women in Morocco" and "Building Networks for Women's Rights." 
Published in Arabic to help ensure a wider distribution, the two 
publications support women's rights by building the capacity of 
local associations to identify and interpret laws relating to women 
in society. 
 
-------------------------------- 
WOMEN CANDIDATES' CAMPAIGN PLANS 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶9. Against the backdrop of upcoming elections in Algeria and 
Morocco, more than 60 women, including several potential candidates, 
participated in the fifth Women's Regional Campaign Academy entitled 
"Partners in Participation" from April 15-19 in Marrakech. 
Organized by the National Democratic Institute (NDI), this unique 
event provided participants with an opportunity to showcase their 
achievements while supporting and encouraging others who aspire to 
become more politically active.  The Academy also offered women from 
across the region a chance to meet and develop a network of 
colleagues, not only from the Middle East and North Africa, but also 
from around the world, who, are also dedicated politicians and 
activists.  This important program featured more than a dozen 
international campaign experts and several distinguished guests, 
including Ambassador Riley, Congresswoman Jane Harman, 
Parliamentarian Milouda Hazeb, the Minister-Delegate for Moroccans 
Living Abroad, and the Mayor of Marrakech.

WOMEN'S BUSINESS AND LEGAL SKILLS TRAINING 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶10. Thirty-six women from the Middle East and North Africa are in 
the United States to participate in a six-month MEPI-sponsored Legal 
and Business Fellowship Program intended to develop their 
educational and leadership skills.  The fellows were selected from 
more than 500 applicants, based on their leadership potential and 
commitment to professional growth in the business and legal sectors 
of their countries.  Starting in March, they studied for one month 
at either the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of 
Business or Law School, followed by five-month internships working 
with leading U.S. corporations and law firms.
