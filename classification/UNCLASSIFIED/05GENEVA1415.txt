       JOINT COMPLIANCE AND INSPECTION COMMISSION 
               JOINT STATEMENT NUMBER 37 
 
             ON SLBMS IN LAUNCH CANISTERS 
 
     With respect to the Treaty between the United States of 
America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the 
Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms of July 
31, 1991, hereinafter referred to as the Treaty, the Parties 
understand that for SLBMs that are maintained, stored, and 
transported as assembled missiles in launch canisters, 
including the SLBM designated by the Russian Federation as 
the RSM-56, an assembled missile of a particular type, in its 
launch canister, shall be considered to be an SLBM of that 
type. 
 
     The Parties understand that the Treaty definition of 
"launch canister" shall also mean a container, directly 
associated with an SLBM, that can be or has been used for 
transporting and storing an assembled SLBM, with or without 
its front section, and from which an SLBM can be or has been 
launched. 
 
     The Parties agree that the provisions of the Treaty that 
apply to ICBMs that are maintained, stored, and transported 
as assembled missiles in launch canisters, or their launch 
canisters, shall also apply to SLBMs that are maintained, 
stored, and transported as assembled missiles in launch 
canisters, or their launch canisters, including the SLBM 
designated by the Russian Federation as the RSM-56, unless 
otherwise agreed.  The Parties shall, within the framework of 
the Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission, discuss and 
agree on, as appropriate, any exceptions to or modifications 
of the specific provisions of the Treaty that will apply for 
such SLBMs or their launch canisters.

       JOINT COMPLIANCE AND INSPECTION COMMISSION 
               JOINT STATEMENT NUMBER 38 
 
   ON TRAINING MODELS OF MISSILES FOR THE RSM-56 SLBM 
 
     The Parties, referring to the Treaty Between the United 
States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms 
of July 31, 1991, hereinafter referred to as the Treaty, 
understand that training models of the SLBM designated by the 
Russian Federation as the RSM-56 differ from SLBMs of that 
type on the basis of the following declared external and 
functional differences that are visible during inspections 
conducted pursuant to the Treaty: 
 
     Two holes, each no less than 15 millimeters in diameter, 
drilled through the launch canister, in the region of the 
first stage rocket motor; and, coaxial with one of these two 
holes, one hole, no less than ten millimeters in diameter, 
drilled through the casing of the first stage rocket motor 
and into the inert propellant. 
 
     Nothing in this Joint Statement shall be deemed to 
prejudice the right of the Russian Federation to declare 
other external and functional differences to differentiate 
training models of missiles for the RSM-56 from SLBMs of that 
type. 
 
     To assist inspectors, the Russian Federation shall 
either provide a photograph of each of the differences of 
training models of missiles for the RSM-56 or, if a 
photograph of any of such differences has not been provided 
prior to the first inspection of an item declared to be a 
training model of such a missile on the basis of such a 
difference, the inspected Party shall provide to the 
inspecting Party, during that inspection, a photograph of the 
difference, taken in accordance with paragraph 18 of Section 
VI of, and Subsection B of Section VI of Annex 8 to, the 
Protocol on Inspections and Continuous Monitoring Activities 
Relating to the Treaty.
