SUBJECT: MAINE AND NEW BRUNSWICK COMMIT TO DEVELOPING NORTHEAST 
ENERGY CORRIDOR 
 
¶1. New Brunswick Premier Shawn Graham and Maine Governor John 
Baldacci announced on March 25 that they will work together to 
explore development of the northeast energy corridor.  Irving 
Oil of Saint John will also be involved in the concept which 
would see the state and province create an energy highway 
between the two jurisdictions.  The goal is to have electricity, 
natural gas and petroleum products flow more easily from New 
Brunswick to the U.S. market with an emphasis on renewable power 
(including wind and tidal) and natural-gas-fired co-generation. 
Irving Oil's role will be to develop a complex series of energy 
projects in partnership with other companies outside New 
Brunswick. 
 
¶2.  Comment:  The governor and premier are hoping that their new 
commitment will eventually lead to further secure energy 
supplies and energy independence for both jurisdictions. 
However, as Irving Oil reps have acknowledged, this undertaking 
comes at "particularly challenging" time given the present 
economic climate.  Post will be discussing this concept with our 
energy contacts over the coming weeks to learn more about the 
details and just what the expected impact will be on new energy 
supplies for the U.S. Northeast.  End comment
