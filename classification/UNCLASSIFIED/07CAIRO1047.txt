¶1.   (U)  In response to reftel, the Government of Egypt finalized 
an Avian Influenza (AI) Communication Strategy in May 2006, focusing 
on the prevention phase, in strict accordance with WHO guidelines 
for outbreak communication.  The GOE prepared this plan in 
cooperation with Egypt's AI communication working group. 
Participants in the working group include the Egyptian Ministries of 
Health and Information, as well as USAID, WHO, UNICEF and FAO.  We 
forwarded a copy of Egypt's complete AI Communication Strategy to 
the AIAG. 
 
¶2.  (U)  GOE officials are developing the Egypt Pandemic Phase 
Communication Strategy, which will be issued as a companion document 
to the AI Communication Strategy under the title "Supplement to the 
AI Communication Strategy."  This strategy, being prepared in 
cooperation with Egypt's AI communication working group, is also in 
accordance with WHO guidelines for communication strategies.
