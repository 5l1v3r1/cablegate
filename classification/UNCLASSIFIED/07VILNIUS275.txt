We delivered reftel points to Irena Vedrickaite, Head of the 
MFA's Africa and Middle East Division, on April 12.  She said 
she regretted to inform us that the FM's schedule would not 
allow him to attend the ICI signing.  The GOL will be 
represented by its Ambassador to Egypt.  She indicated that 
Lithuania is not ready to propose any new money or projects, 
but pointed out that it is hosting a training operation from 
April 11 - April 25 for Iraqi Detention System personnel.
