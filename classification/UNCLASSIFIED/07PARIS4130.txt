SUBJECT: FRANCE TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS ON BURMA 
 
REF: STATE 12958 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On October 1 poloff delivered reftel demarche to 
MFA desk officer for Burma, Jeremy Petit, who described 
France,s position as "totally parallel" to the U.S. 
position.  Petit expects the EU to announce new sanctions on 
Burma on October 3 and speculated these sanctions could add 
names to the 400 individuals who were sanctioned under the 
2006 EU Common Position on Burma.  He also believes a 
targeted trade embargo could be announced by the EU. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Following up on France,s Secretary of State for 
Human Rights Rama Yade effort to travel to Burma, Petit said 
the Burmese mission has still not issued a visa.  Petit 
described the Burmese Mission to Paris as being in "total 
disorder" and said that the Ambassador Saw Hla Min is a 
military officer who does not speak English, the language the 
French MFA uses to demarche the Burmese mission.  He 
complained Saw Hla Min does not have a handle on the key 
political issues.  Petit speculated that a visa for Rama Yade 
would most likely never be issued. 
 
¶3.   (SBU)  Poloff also met separately on September 28 with 
MFA DAS equivalent Fabrice Mauries who reiterated that France 
condemns the military crackdown and is working through the EU 
and the UN to increase the pressure on Rangoon.  As evidence 
of a newly activist MFA, the French are also contacting ASEAN 
members according to First Secretary Shaun Grosse from the 
Singapore Embassy.  Grosse told Poloff the French MFA will 
demarche the Singaporeans on October 3.  We do not know the 
level of French demarches on ASEAN members.
