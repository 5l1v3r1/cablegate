North Korea Missile Launch 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Referring to the planned DPRK missile launch, spokesperson Qin 
Gang said at the regularly-scheduled March 24 MFA press briefing 
that China hopes "all parties will be restrained and calm so as not 
to complicate the situation." The most important thing is "a 
peaceful, stable and denuclearized Korean Peninsula." South Korean 
Six-Party Talks Head of Delegation Wi Sung-lac will visit China to 
meet with Chinese VFM Wu Dawei to "exchange views on the Six-Party 
Talks and the situation on the Korean Peninsula." The spokesperson 
had "no information" on a reported invitation to President Hu Jintao 
to visit North Korea. 
 
Americans on the DPRK Border 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Asked about the U.S. citizens detained by North Korea, Qin said 
that "the male American citizen involved has left China and two 
females are not in China."  Qin referred questions to "relevant 
countries." 
 
South China Sea Dispute 
----------------------- 
 
¶4.  The "latest statements by the U.S. side" regarding the South 
China Sea "reverse black and white" (diandao heibai), said Qin. 
China is "determined to protect its sovereignty" and "hopes that the 
U.S. side will take appropriate actions to prevent future 
occurrences" similar to the recent incident.  China also hopes that 
relevant countries will abide by the "declaration of conduct" in the 
South China Sea. 
 
Meetings on Afghanistan 
----------------------- 
 
¶5. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting to be held in 
Moscow on March 27 will have a special focus on Afghanistan 
terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime, said Qin.  China 
will "elaborate on its positions" and "make suggestions" during the 
conference.  China will "not send troops outside of its boarders" 
unless on a UN peace keeping mission.  VFM Song Tao will attend the 
conference in Moscow while VFM Wu Dawei will attend a separate 
conference on Afghanistan at the Hague on March 31. 
 
Dalai Lama's Visit to South Africa 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6. China "appreciates the measures of relevant countries" said Qin 
when asked about South Africa's reported rejection of a visa for the 
Dalai Lama.  China "opposes other countries' official contact with 
the Dalai Lama or their providing him a platform for separatism." 
The Dalai Lama is "not a religious figure but a political exile" 
whose "true colors are known around the world" said Qin. 
 
Internet Censorship 
------------------- 
 
¶7. The spokesman was "unsure" whether video sharing website Youtube 
has been blocked in China, but said that "China manages the Internet 
according to law." The Chinese government is "not afraid of the 
Internet" said Qin, noting that China has more than 3OO million 
Internet users.  China learned to restrict the Internet "from the UK 
and United States." Qin pointed to U.S. laws "passed in the 1990s to 
prevent the spread of harmful information and protect children" as 
well as to the "Patriot Act which allows the government to monitor" 
what is said on the Internet.

Death Penalty in China 
---------------------- 
 
¶8. Asked about a recent Amnesty International report on the death 
penalty in China, Qin said that "competent authorities have stated 
China's position on the death penalty many times." Qin noted that he 
is "only a civil servant." 
 
China Navy Celebrations 
----------------------- 
 
¶9. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the founding the PLA Navy 
and Chinese authorities will "plan a ceremony to celebrate," said 
Qin.  Qin referred more specific questions to "relevant 
authorities." 
 
Peru-China Relations 
-------------------- 
 
¶10. China and Peru are "maintaining communication" regarding a 
possible future visit of a Peruvian leader to China. China wants to 
continue to discuss free trade with Peru which "is good for both 
countries." China also "attaches great importance" to relations with 
Peru and would like to maintain high level exchanges. 
 
Visit of Australian FM 
---------------------- 
 
¶11. Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith will visit China and 
exchange views with Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and other Chinese 
leaders, said Qin.  China and Australia are two "important 
countries" in the region and bilateral relations between the two 
will "contribute to regional peace and stability." 
 
Tiananmen Massacre 
------------------ 
 
¶12. "There has already been a conclusion" reached regarding the 
"incident of 20 years ago" said Qin when asked to comment on the 
reported disappearance of a soldier involved in the Tiananmen 
massacre.  Qin said he had no information about the soldier. 
 
Remains of Chinese Soldiers in Papua New Guinea 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶13. China "attaches great importance" to the recovery of remains of 
Chinese soldiers in Papua New Guinea and has "already begun 
preparations" to deal with the situation.
