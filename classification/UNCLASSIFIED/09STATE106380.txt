RESPONSE TO LTG JAMES DUTTAN, DEPUTY ISAF COMMANDER 
 
Â¶1. (U) Post is authorized to present the following statement 
at the October 14 Joint FSC/Permanent Council meeting in 
Vienna. 
 
Begin text: 
 
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 
 
On behalf of the United States delegation, I would like to 
thank LTG Duttan for his comprehensive report on the status 
of ISAF activities in Afghanistan.  The U.S. believes 
strongly that the International Security Assistance Force,s 
(ISAF) efforts to provide security for Afghanistan's citizens 
against the Taliban and al-Qaeda also helps defend citizens 
in all OSCE participating and Partner States.  We also 
believe the OSCE has a role in this regard to complement and 
support NATO and ISAF activities in Afghanistan. 
 
What we mean by this is that while NATO and ISAF have a firm 
hand on providing for hard security in Afghanistan, we 
believe the OSCE could provide complementary added value in 
tackling some of Afghanistan,s other security issues through 
border security, customs, counterterrorism, and other law 
enforcement assistance programs, as proposed by the OSCE 
Secretariat and the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Afghanistan. 
 
In 2008, the United States strongly backed the implementation 
of OSCE projects 15A and 16, which were aimed at training and 
mentoring Afghanistan border and customs personnel in 
northern Afghanistan.  Unfortunately, as a result of the 
objections by one participating State, we have not yet been 
able to implement those needed projects. 
 
The United States will continue to support increased efforts 
to train, equip, and mentor border security, customs and law 
enforcement personnel in Afghanistan.  Such efforts can help 
strengthen Afghanistan's regional identity within Central 
Asia and contribute to enhanced regional cooperation. 
Assisting Afghanistan to better secure its borders has the 
secondary effect of also bolstering the border security of 
European, Eurasian, and the North Atlantic OSCE participating 
States, and the provision of border security technical 
assistance to Afghanistan is consistent with the OSCE 
multidimensional, comprehensive approach to security. 
 
In our view, when coordinated closely with ongoing border 
security activities in Afghanistan carried out by the United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the International 
Organization for Migration, as well as bilateral donors, OSCE 
border security projects could help improve Afghanistan,s 
capacity to: 
 
      -- Interdict narcotics; 
      -- Thwart illegal trafficking of peoples and illicit 
goods; 
      -- Interdict material support for terrorist operations; 
      -- Coordinate with NATO and other international actors; 
and 
      -- Support the full implementation of UNSCR 1540 
regarding the interdiction of possible trans-shipment of 
Weapons of Mass Destruction, related materials, or precursors 
through Afghanistan. 
 
Attacks perpetrated by al-Qaeda and its violent extremist 
affiliates in Great Britain, Spain, the United States, 
Russia, and attempted terrorist attacks in Germany have 
demonstrated the vulnerability of borders within the OSCE 
region.  Increased support for improving Afghanistan,s 
ability to better police its borders can enhance 
Afghanistan,s security, promote regional stability, and also 
provide important security benefits to all OSCE participating 
States and Partners. 
 
Thank you Madame Chairwoman. 
CLINTON
