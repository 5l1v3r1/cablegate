AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL ANNUAL REPORT 
 
"CROSSING THE LINE" 
HERVE CANNET IN REGIONAL LA NOUVELLE REPUBLIQUE DU CENTRE 
(05/26): "THE U.S. AND GREAT BRITAIN, IN REACTION TO THESE 
KILLERS (THE TERRORISTS) HAVE NEVERTHELESS CROSSED THE LINE BY 
NORMALIZING THE USE OF TORTURE AND BY SACRIFICING, OFFICIALLY 
AND IN THE NAME OF THEIR OWN SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
DIGNITY, WHICH THEY CLAIM TO OTHERWISE DEFEND: IN AFGHANISTAN, 
IN IRAQ OR IN THE INFAMOUS PRISON OF GUANTANAMO, `THE NEW 
GULAG OF OUR TIMES,' AND A ZONE OF LAWLESSNESS. BEHIND THESE 
ACCUSATIONS, WHICH CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED, LURK ALL MANNER OF 
TORTURERS EVERYWHERE UNITING TO CHALLENGE HUMAN RIGHTS. THE 
SHAMEFUL SILENCE OF THE WORLD AND THE UN MUST NOT LET AMNESTY 
INTERNATIONAL'S CRY ECHO IN A DESERT OF GOOD INTENTIONS." 
 
"TORTURE AND SEMANTICS" 
JACQUES CAMUS IN REGIONAL LA REPUBLIQUE DU CENTRE (05/26): 
"THE AI REPORT IS A PAINFUL CATALOGUE OF HORRORS. THE REPORT 
ZEALOUSLY POINTS AN ACCUSING FINGER AT ONE AND ALL. IT IS 
REGRETTABLE THAT THE U.S. IS CRITICIZED WITH AS MUCH 
INSISTENCE AS NORTH KOREA. BUT OUR DEMOCRACIES MUST SERVE AS 
EXAMPLES. IN THIS REGARD AI'S CONDEMNATION OF 
INSTITUTIONALIZED TORTURE BY THE AMERICANS IN THE NAME OF AN 
IDEAL OF JUSTICE, IN THE PRISONS OF BAGRAM, GUANTANAMO AND ABU 
GHARAIB, ARE UNDERSTANDABLE. BY PLAYING WITH SEMANTICS AND 
CALLING TORTURE `SENSORY MANIPULATION' THE WHITE HOUSE IS 
LOOKING TO REMOVE GUILT FROM THE GUILTY. THIS IS NO MORE 
TOLERABLE THAN THE HUMILIATION INFLICTED BY U.S. SOLDIERS." 
 
"AMNESTY DENOUNCES `GUANTANAMO THE GULAG'" 
JACQUES DUPLOUICH IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (05/26): "THE 
WORST EXAMPLE GIVEN IN THE AI REPORT IS THAT OF THE U.S. . 
WHICH HAS `REDEFINED' THE NOTION OF TORTURE AS PART OF ITS WAR 
AGAINST TERRORISM. THE INVENTORY OF ATROCITIES, INJUSTICES AND 
NON-IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW ARE INDEED 
DEPRESSING." 
 
"FOR AI, GUANTANAMO IS A `MODERN GULAG'" 
JEAN-PIERRE LANGELLIER IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LE MONDE (05/26): 
"CONTINUOUS AND MASSIVE VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AROUND THE 
WORLD ARE A BETRAYAL OF A PROMISE MADE BY THE WORLD'S LEADERS, 
AND FOREMOST BY THE MOST POWERFUL OF THEM ALL: THIS IS THE 
MAIN ACCUSATION MADE BY AI IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT. IN THIS 
CATALOGUE OF HORRORS, GOOD NEWS IS SCARCE AND ALL THE MORE 
PRECIOUS. AI IS SATISFIED WITH SEVERAL DECISIONS MADE BY THE 
U.S. SUPREME COURT REGARDING SEVERAL GUANTANAMO PRISONERS." 
 
"THE U.S. ON THE BENCH OF THE ACCUSED" 
SACHA BALIT VANDERBROUCK IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER FRANCE SOIR 
(05/26): "AI IS DENOUNCING A `NEW WORLD ORDER' WITH AT ITS 
CORE THE WAR AGAINST TERROR. AND ON THE BENCH OF THE ACCUSED 
STANDS THE U.S. WHICH CLAIMS TO BE A NATION OF JUSTICE AND 
FREEDOM, WHILE SOME OF ITS SOLDIERS HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF 
TORTURE AND ILL TREATMENT IN THE IRAQI PRISON OF ABU GHARAIB 
AND IN GUANTANAMO, WHICH AI CALLS A `MODERN TIMES GULAG.' FOR 
AI, WASHINGTON IS INAUGURATING NEW TERMINOLOGY., USING TRENDY 
MANAGEMENT VOCABULARY TO SWEETEN WHAT IS TORTURE, CALLING IT 
ENVIRONMENTAL MANIPULATION. MORE SERIOUS EVEN IS THE FACT THAT 
BY GIVING IN TO SUCH PRACTICES, THE FIRST WORLD POWER IS 
ENCOURAGING OTHERS DO TO DO LIKEWISE." 
MIDDLE EAST - ABBAS TO WASHINGTON 
 
"ABBAS WANTS BUSH TO GET INVOLVED" 
PHILIPPE GELIE IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (05/26): "THE 
AMERICAN PRESIDENT IS CONVINCED OF ONE THING: CHANGE IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST WILL BE SLOW AND CAN ONLY COME FROM THE TWO 
PLAYERS THEMSELVES. THIS IS WHAT HAS BEEN KEEPING HIM FROM 
GETTING PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THE PEACE PROCESS, UNLIKE HIS 
PREDECESSOR BILL CLINTON. BUT TODAY PRESIDENT BUSH IS 
WELCOMING MAHMUD ABBAS, A GUEST FOR WHOM CHANGE IS URGENT. HE 
NEEDS TO LEAVE WASHINGTON WITH A U.S. COMMITMENT FOR MORE 
INVOLVEMENT IN GETTING THE PEACE PROCESS BACK ON TRACK. THE 
ISSUE HERE IS TO GET THE U.S. TO EXERT MORE PRESSURE ON 
ISRAEL. THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER HAS SET DRACONIAN 
CONDITIONS FOR THE `FINAL SETTLEMENT.' AND THIS IS WHERE ABBAS 
ABSOLUTELY NEEDS BUSH'S HELP. IN WASHINGTON'S CIRCLES THE IDEA 
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MUST NO LONGER HAVE THE TERMS OF ITS 
POLICY DICTATED BY ISRAEL IS BEGINNING TO GAIN GROUND. THIS 
NEW TONE . COULD LEAD PRESIDENT BUSH TO OVERCOME HIS 
RELUCTANCE TO GET INVOLVED AND WEIGH IN DIRECTLY ON THE 
PARTIES." 
 
EUROPEAN ISSUES - REFERENDUM 
 
"SAVING THE `YES'" 
SERGE JULY IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (05/26): "IN SPITE OF 
HIS FORTY YEARS IN THE POLITICAL ARENA, CHIRAC HAS 
NEVERTHELESS MADE SEVERAL MISTAKES IN THE BATTLE BEING NOW 
WAGED. WITH THREE DAYS TO GO BEFORE THE REFERENDUM, HE STANDS 
ALONE AND UNPOPULAR FACING THE VOID. THE JUMP HE IS ABOUT TO 
TAKE CARRIES EITHER CONFIRMATION OF HIS FAILURE OR THE MAKINGS 
OF A `YES' VOTE. HE KNOWS INSTINCTIVELY THAT IF THIS EVENING, 
DURING HIS ADDRESS, HE LIMITS HIS PITCH TO SAYING THAT THE 
CONSTITUTION IS GOOD FOR FRANCE AND ITS FUTURE, HE IS 
PRACTICALLY SURE TO PRECIPITATE A `NO' VICTORY ALL BY HIMSELF. 
TO DISTINGUISH THE VOTE ON THE REFERENDUM FROM NATIONAL 
CONCERNS, HIS ONLY CHOICE IS TO ACCEPT TO DISSOLVE THE 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY IN SEPTEMBER. THE FRENCH WOULD THEN VOTE 
TWICE: ONCE FOR THE CONSTITUTION AND ONCE TO ELECT A NEW 
ASSEMBLY. THERE WOULD BE NO CONFUSION BETWEEN EU ISSUES AND A 
SANCTION VOTE." 
 
"WASHINGTON VOTES `NO,' BEIJING IS STILL HESITATING" 
JACQUES AMALRIC IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (05/26): "NO ONE 
SHOULD TAKE SILENCE FOR INDIFFERENCE. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES 
TO WASHINGTON AND BEIJING. LACK OF STATEMENTS FROM THESE TWO 
CAPITALS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE ISSUE OF THE EU'S CONSTRUCTION 
IS OF NO INTEREST TO THEM. ESPECIALLY TO THE U.S., WHERE, 
OTHER THAN A FEW KIND WORDS FROM PRESIDENT BUSH DURING HIS 
TRIP TO BRUSSELS, NO ONE WANTS TO SEE THE EMERGENCE OF A 
EUROPE-POWER. IT IS ENOUGH TO THINK BACK TO RUMSFELD'S SARCASM 
ON `OLD EUROPE.' IF THE EUROPEAN TREATY WERE POSTPONED 
INDEFINITELY THIS WOULD NOT DISPLEASE THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, 
WHICH HAS BARELY TURNED A BIT LESS ARROGANT SINCE ITS 
REVERSALS IN IRAQ AND HAS NEW DOUBTS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF 
`FAITHFULNESS' IT CAN EXPECT FROM NEW EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. EVEN 
IF NOTHING IS BEING SAID, ON MONDAY IN WASHINGTON A FRENCH 
`NO' WOULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR THE U.S. . WHICH IS LESS THAN 
EAGER TO SEE THE EMERGENCE OF A EUROPEAN POWER IN SEARCH OF 
INDEPENDENCE. CONVERSELY. BEIJING'S POSITION IS MORE 
AMBIVALENT." WOLFF
