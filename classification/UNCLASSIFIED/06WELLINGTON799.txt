REF: SECSTATE 152526 
 
 ¶1. In response to reftel, Post contacted Skywork Helicopters 
Ltd. to ascertain the bona fides of the foreign end-user and 
whether the order for 100 Pynco NVIS filtered lamp assemblies 
(P/N 2654-73P) had in fact been ordered and received. Skywork 
Helicopters Ltd. is in fact a legitimate New Zealand 
corporation located in Warkworth and has been listed with the 
New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development since September 
1996 as a viable enterprise incorporated under the laws of 
this country. Econoff spoke with Roger Stevenson one of the 
directors of the company and to Dean Voelkerling the person 
responsible for installation of the components in question. 
Per Mr. Voelkerling, the company did in fact order the parts 
but the arrangement calls for Air Defense Products Asia 
(ADP), located in Warriewood, Australia, to hold the parts 
while Skywork ships their "audio controller boxes" to be 
retrofitted at the ADP facilities in Australia. Skywork's POC 
at ADP for this work is David Coleman. Skywork did admit that 
they have been waiting two months for this work to commence 
and is beginning to wonder what is causing the delay. Post 
recommends that PM/DTCC follows-up with ADP to ascertain the 
receipt of the 100 NVIS lamp assemblies earmarked for Skywork 
Helicopters. 
 
¶2. The POC at Post for Blue Lantern issues is Econoff, Tom 
Walsh who is prepared to follow-up with Skywork Helicopters 
if there are more specific questions or details regarding 
this case. Contact information, phone: (64) (4) 462-6000, 
email: walshtj@state.gov.
