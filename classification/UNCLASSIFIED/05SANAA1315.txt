SUBJECT: YEMENI MEDIA REACTION TO RETRACTION OF NEWSWEEK 
MAGAZINE REPORT ALLEGING DESECRATION OF KORAN BY U.S. 
INTERROGATORS AT GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA. 
 
REF: STATE 00088240 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  Yemeni media reporting of the retraction by 
Newsweek of its story alleging desecration of the Koran in 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is thus far fairly widespread and 
straightforward. Notable exceptions are official media 
outlets Saba News Agency and Al-Thawra newspaper.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  The Newsweek retraction of a May 9, 2005 report alleging 
the desecration of the Koran by American soldiers at 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba was reported on May 17 by Aden-based Al- 
Ayyam independent daily, Al-Sahwa Net (news website of 
Islah), the Defense Ministry-run news website 26 September, 
and even by sensationalist Akhbar Al-Yawm independent daily. 
All reports were fair and straightforward.  Along with the 
Newsweek retraction (which was published in full by Al-Ayyam 
and partly by the others) Al-Ayyam quoted doubts in 
Afghanistan and Pakistan on the retraction. 
 
¶3.  Official media, such as Al-Thawra and Saba News Agency, 
however, did not publish the Newsweek retraction.  On the 
contrary, Saba News Agency published on May 17 a strongly 
worded statement by the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia 
condemning the alleged Koran desecration and demanding that 
those responsible for the desecration receive a deterring 
punishment.
