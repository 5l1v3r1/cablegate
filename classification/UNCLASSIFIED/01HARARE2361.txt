¶1.   UNDER HEADLINE "U. S. DEMOCRACY BILL DRACONIAN: IN 
   WHOSE INTEREST IS THE LEGISLATION?," THE AUGUST 7 EDITION 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HARARE  02361  091342Z 
   OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY 'THE HERALD' CARRIED A 
   LENGTHY FEATURE ARTICLE THAT WAS CRITICAL OF THE BILL. 
   EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   ". . .IN WHOSE INTEREST WAS THE BILL PASSED. . .?  IT 
   IS CLEAR THAT THE BILL HAS COME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF 
   PRESIDENT MUGABE'S UNCOMPROMISING STANCE ON THE LAND 
   ISSUE, AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS SAID, INCLUDING 
   PERCEIVED VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND LACK OF RULE OF 
   LAW, IS JUST A SMOKE-SCREEN TO COVER THE REAL PURPOSE OF 
   THE BILL.  THE CONTROVERSIAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS 
   MEANT TO PUNISH ZIMBABWE FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR 
   ITS PEOPLE - REDISTRIBUTING LAND EQUALLY AMONG ALL 
   CITIZENS IRRESPECTIVE OF COLOR, RELIGION OR POLITICAL 
   AFFILIATION. . . ."
