SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: AMCIT PROPERTY CLAIMS MONTHLY UPDATE: OCTOBER 2007
 
¶1. Summary: In October of the 2007-2008 waiver year, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) did not report the resolution of any Embassy-registered property claim. Since January 1995, 2,516 Embassy-registered property claims belonging to 657 American citizens (Amcits) have been resolved. There remain 677 registered property claims belonging to 295 Amcits. Including Amcit claims not registered with the Embassy, a total of 4,536 Amcits' claims have been resolved since January 1995. Most have involved compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds (bonos de pago de indemnizacion or BPIs). As of August 1, 2007 (the start of the waiver year), the GON had issued BPIs with a face value of $321,300,000 to Embassy-registered claimants. Since then, the GON has issued no new BPIs. However, local courts did issue decisions in two cases in favor of two Amcit claimants with separate claims in August and September 2007. The GON has resolved seven total cases during CY07, two during this current waiver year. End Summary.
