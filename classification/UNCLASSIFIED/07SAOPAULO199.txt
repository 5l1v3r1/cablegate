"Ethanol and the Brazil-US relationship" 
 
Former Brazilian Ambassador in Washington Roberto Abdenur commented 
in business-oriented Valor Economico: "The Brazil-US understanding 
about biofuels requires a more comprehensive analysis of what it 
means for the evolution of bilateral relations.  If it is used well 
by Brazil, the initiative may help to provide more dynamism and 
diversification to our sales to the US, which have been stagnant for 
a decade at just 1.4% of the US market.... The understanding is part 
of a previously launched more comprehensive Brazilian initiative - 
the Biofuels Forum, which, in addition to the two nations, includes 
India, China, South Africa and the European Union in an effort to 
globalize ethanol and enlarge the use of biodiesel. The new 
partnership shows a little noticed reality in the relations between 
Brazil and the US: the relationship, which was formerly highly 
asymmetric and 'unilateral' (in the sense that the US was the only 
supplier of investment, know how and technology), has become 
increasingly more balanced and is gaining more mutuality.... The 
memorandum of understanding on biofuels creates, for the first time, 
a new dimension in the relations between the two nations: the joint 
work towards development and to reduce poverty in Latin America, the 
Caribbean, Africa and Asia.... Some observers' disappointment with 
the fact that President Bush has not committed himself to eliminate 
or reduce tariffs on ethanol imported from Brazil is misplaced. Bush 
simply could not make concessions in a matter where the decision 
power belongs to the Congress.... Barriers like those affecting our 
ethanol and orange juice exports will naturally fall: they will be 
removed as a result of developments in the US economy, in Brazil and 
in the world."
