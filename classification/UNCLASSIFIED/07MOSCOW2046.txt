¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, TASC-T, Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on 
BIS license application D363392 as the ultimate 
consignee of one X200XP Thermal-Eye camera system. 
These items are controlled for national security, 
nuclear non-proliferation, regional stability, anti-

The licensee is L-3 Communications Infrared Products, 
13532 North Central Expressway, M/S, Dallas, TX 75243. 
(NOTE:  Paragraph 9 of reftel shows one X200XP camera, 
though paragraph 13 references two cameras. END NOTE.) 
 
¶3. On April 17, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with TASC-T, 
Moscow, Elektrozavodskaya St. #52, Moscow, Russia. The 
export control team met with Ivan Sbornov, Deputy 
General Director. 
 
¶4. TASC-T was founded in 2006 as a limited-liability 
company specializing in security equipment, safety 
systems development and deployment.  The company is a 
distributor of both domestically produced and imported 
alarm systems, video surveillance, magnetometers, and 
fire safety equipment.  TASC-T is an authorized 
distributor for L-3 Communications/Thermal-Eye and for 
ICM of Belgium.  The company works with government and 
commercial organizations as well as private 
individuals.  TASC-T employs 10, and has a production 
facility as well as the office visited in the northern 
section of Moscow.  TASC-T recently applied for a 
permit to produce and sell it's own equipment, and 
expects to receive the permit in approximately two 
months. 
 
¶5. The team was shown a Thermal-Eye model 7070415-3, 
serial number 01458.  Company sales personnel use this 
camera, along with a second received under the 
license, as demonstrator models.  The team reviewed 
the logbook required by the license conditions, noting 
demonstrations for Lukoil, RAO-UES of Russia, and the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs.  No 
sales have been made to date.  The second camera is 
currently at a trade show in Kazan, where the sales 
team is attending a security products trade show. 
 
¶6. When not in use the cameras are stored in the 
company safe, located in the Deputy General Director's 
office.  The office has an electronic security system 
with proximity cards for access to offices.  Only 
three employees are authorized to access and travel 
with the camera, Mr. Sbornov (who is responsible for 
the camera), the General Director, and the Sales 
Manager.  When traveling, the camera stays in the 
possession of one of the three officers noted.

Russia as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities.
