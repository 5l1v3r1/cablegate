Madame Ambassador, 
 
I refer to Process MDIC-SECEX-RJ no. 52100-050753/2002-10, 
regarding the investigation into the practice of dumping of 
Acrylonitrile in exports to Brazil, classified under NCM Code 
2926.10.00, when originating from the United States of America, 
opened through SECEX Circular no. 35 of August 15, 2002, 
published in Diario Oficial da Uniao on August 19, 2002. 
 
In accordance with Article 61 of Decree no. 1602 of August 23, 
1995, I am advising that the Department of Foreign Trade - 
SECEX of this Ministry, based on Finding DECOM no. 2 of 
February 4, 2004, decided to close the investigation and 
without application of measures, because no causal connection 
was found between the export of Acrylonitrile originating from 
the U.S.A. and damages claimed by domestic industry, as put 
forth in SECEX Circular no. 7 of February 16, 2004, published 
in D.O.U. of February 18, 2004, attached. 
 
Sincerely, 
(signed) 
Armando de Mello Meziat 
Director, Dept of Commercial Defense
