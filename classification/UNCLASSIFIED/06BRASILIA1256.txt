SUBJECT: PK 334 FSN SECRETARIAL SEMINAR NOMINATION FOR DAISY COSTA 
 
 
¶1. Mission Brasilia is nominating Daisy Costa to participate in 
FSI's PK 334 Secretarial Training Seminar.  Daisy is a veteran 
employee of the Embassy in Brasilia where she has been working for 
the past 21 years.  Over that time she has proven herself a valuable 
resource to the Science and Technology Division and is extremely 
well regarded by the Embassy community. 
 
¶2. That said, while Daisy's institutional knowledge is very strong, 
she has been given few opportunities for training (one U.S. based 
training in 21 years), and is as yet unfamiliar with current trends 
and practices in time and resource management.  These are two areas 
that would help immensely in Daisy's ever-increasing day to day 
workload, not to mention in implementing and streamlining up-to-date 
operating procedures for the Science Division.  Moreover, Daisy is a 
forward looking individual who desires immensely to expand her 
career and scope of responsibilities.  This training will bestow 
Daisy with both the confidence and skills necessary to grow 
professionally.  Finally, because of her position in the Embassy 
community, Daisy will be well disposed to share and to pass on the 
knowledge that she garners from the course.  For these reasons, we 
are requesting Daisy Costa's admission to the program.
