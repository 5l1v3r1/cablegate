ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAM 
 
 
¶1.  On February 10, Econoff attended a working dinner at the 
Grand Serail for the launching of "Bader" (literally the 
beginning of the day in Arabic, refers to a "start-up" 
company), a partnership between the private sector and the 
GOL to encourage entrepreneurship.  In attendance were about 
fifty businessmen, including several successful young 
Lebanese entrepreneurs, PM Siniora, Finance Minister Azour, 
and Minister of Economy and Trade Haddad.  They listened to a 
series of presentations focused on creating a "culture of 
entrepreneurship" among Lebanese students and recent 
graduates. 
 
¶2.  Bader's objective, according to founding members, is to 
create jobs and opportunities for the young generation of 
Lebanese through a renewed entrepreneurial spirit.  The group 
has noticed that many recent Lebanese graduates who would 
normally be qualified entrepreneurial candidates choose to 
work abroad, and qualified graduates who stay in Lebanon 
choose to work in large corporations, consulting firms, or 
banks.  Key issues raised in Bader's preliminary action plan 
include:  raising awareness of entrepreneurship by having a 
road show of high profile executives at leading universities 
and launching a media campaign to show the incentives and 
tools available in Lebanon to start a new business, creating 
an entrepreneurship center at a local university, supporting 
a USD 50,000 business plan competition modeled on a similar 
competition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(MIT) Entrepreneurship Center, and creating a new Venture 
Capital fund. 
 
¶3.  Founding members were tasked with the job of creating a 
vision and action plan, promoting entrepreneurship through a 
TV and press campaign, eventually serving on a jury for the 
business plan competition, and raising funds for the Venture 
Capital fund and media campaign.  The Venture Capital fund 
would be managed by Kafalat, a Lebanese financial company 
owned partially by banks and the Lebanese equivalent of the 
FDIC that provides financing for small and medium sized 
enterprises.  The group had already received pledges of more 
than USD 200,000 towards "Bader" from the businessmen present 
in the room.
