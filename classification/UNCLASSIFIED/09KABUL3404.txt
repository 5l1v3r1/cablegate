Honorable Barack H. Obama 
President of the United States of America 
The White House 
1600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW 
Washington, DC 20500 
 
Dear President Obama, 
 
I would like to congratulate you on the occasion of being 
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of your 
achievements in eloquently and courageously pursuing world 
peace and advocating a joint effort by all members of the 
international community to confront the common challenges of 
the 21st century. People throughout the world have recognized 
your genuine ambition and efforts in promoting a world where 
all citizens can live in peace, opportunity, and dignity. 
 
The people of Afghanistan are grateful for the continued 
support that the United States has provided for the ongoing 
rebuilding effort in Afghanistan during the past several 
years. We are also particularly appreciative of your renewed 
commitment to Afghanistan as the U.S. Administration is in 
this process of reviewing its overall strategy. The Afghan 
people are looking forward for cooperation and partnership 
with the United States and its international allies to 
overcome the challenges at hand. We are confident that we 
will achieve our goals in bringing security, stability, and 
prosperity to Afghanistan and the region. 
 
Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
With best wishes, 
 
Dr. Abdullah Abdullah 
Afghanistan Presidential Candidate-2009
