SUBJECT: EMBASSY SCIENCE FELLOWS PROGRAM 2009 - CAMBODIA 
 
REF: STATE 10843 
 
¶1.  In response to Reftel, Embassy Phnom Penh would like to submit a 
request for an Embassy Science Fellow to help the Royal Government 
of Cambodia (RGC) develop standard practices for evaluating 
environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for large-scale 
infrastructure projects.  The Fellow would work with the Ministry of 
Environment's (MOE's) EIA Department, and possibly with 
environmental NGOs in Phnom Penh.  The program timeframe is 
flexible, but a two-month fellowship during Winter 2010 would be 
preferable.  Potential Fellows should have experience in drafting 
and/or evaluating EIAs for large-scale infrastructure and investment 
projects such as dams, bridges, urban development initiatives, or 
plantation agriculture ventures.  Experience evaluating projects in 
tropical climates would be helpful but is not necessary. 
 
¶2.  PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION:  Cambodia is rapidly developing, and land 
in various parts of the country is under development by both the RGC 
and private investors for an array of initiatives, ranging from 
rubber plantations to hydropower dams and shopping malls.  With this 
growing level of development activity comes a growing threat to 
Cambodia's natural resources from land-clearing, pollution, and 
unsustainable business practices.  According to Cambodian land and 
environmental laws, public and private entities conducting 
large-scale development projects are required to draft and submit 
EIAs for the Ministry of Environment's approval.  However, the EIA 
Department at the Ministry of Environment is unequipped to manage 
and effectively evaluate the flood of EIAs that are regularly 
submitted for review.  Based on requests from RGC officials, 
including one of Cambodia's Deputy Prime Ministers, a Science Fellow 
could make a valuable contribution to the Ministry of Environment 
by: 
 
 -- Helping the EIA Department develop a standard 
    template for EIAs. 
 
 -- Training the department staff on basic EIA 
    evaluation topics, such as:  1) what questions 
    to ask; 2) what answers to accept; and 3) how to 
    make recommendations. 
 
¶3.  ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT:  Post will provide housing in central 
Phnom Penh, likely a serviced apartment or hotel room, office space 
at the embassy, and in-country travel and logistical support as 
needed. 
 
¶4.  RSO CONCURRANCE:  The RSO has cleared this proposal. 
 
¶5.  CONTACT INFORMATION:  Post contact for this proposal is 
Political/Economic Assistant Juhani Platt, plattjm@state.gov, 
855-23-728-404.
