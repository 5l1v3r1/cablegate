SUBJECT: POLAND: DEMARCHE RESPONSE ON CONTRIBUTIONS FOR 
HAITI INTERIM COOPERATION FRAMEWORK EXTENSION 
 
REF: STATE 116137 
 
¶1. On July 18, Econoff delivered reftel demarche points to 
Mr. Jerzy Pomianowski, Director of Development Co-operation 
Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
Mr.Pomianowski sent the following response dated July 21, 
¶2006. 
 
¶2. Begin text. Thank you for the information on U.S. 
assistancve to Haiti.  Unfortunately, all this year's funds 
for Polish development assistance have been already assigned 
and Haiti (as well as any other country from the Latin 
America regiion) has not been included in the group of Polish 
development assistance priority countries.  Taking into 
consideration the fact that Poland has committed itself to 
increase ODA up to 0.17 percent of its GNP by 2010 and 0.33 
percent by 2015, we will reconsider in the future extending 
the above mentioned list of priority coutnries.  However, we 
cannot yet provide any concrete information on this issue.
