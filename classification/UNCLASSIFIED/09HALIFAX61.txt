SUBJECT: HMCS FREDERICTON TO JOIN NATO COALITION FLEETS 
 
¶1.  Her Majesty's Canadian Ship (HMCS) Fredericton will depart 
Halifax in late November for a six-month mission to the Arabian 
Sea and Indian Ocean as part of NATO's counter-piracy group. 
The NATO group is a multinational, integrated maritime force 
consisting of vessels from various NATO nations that train and 
operate together as a single team.  Fredericton will also 
contribute to the NATO anti-terrorism maritime group, a 
multinational, coalition fleet conducting maritime security 
operations in and around the Persian Gulf, the northern Arabian 
Sea, the Gulf of Oman, the Gulf of Aden, and part of the Indian 
Ocean and the Red Sea. 
 
¶2.  In making the announcement of Fredericton's deployment on 
October 5, Canadian Defence Minister Peter MacKay said this 
contribution demonstrates the importance that Canada attaches to 
international maritime security and its willingness, along with 
Canada's international partners, to continue the fight against 
piracy, and thus increase the level of security in the Arabian 
Sea region. 
 
¶3.  Commissioned in 1994, HMCS Fredericton is a 4,750-metric ton 
multi-role frigate, one of seven based in Halifax.  It has a 
crew of 240 and includes a Sea King helicopter and air 
detachment.  The ship has been working up since spring in 
preparation for this deployment.  See 
http://www.navy.forces.gc.ca/fredericton for additional 
information about the ship. 
 
¶4.  BIO NOTE:  Fredericton's Commanding Officer, Commander 
Steven Wadell is on his third deployment  to the region.  He 
previously served aboard HMCS Algonquin and as Executive Officer 
of HMCS Winnipeg during deployments to SW Asia and the Persian 
Gulf.  He commanded HMCS Charlottetown from June 2008 until 
being named to the command of Fredericton in early 2009.
