REF: A) USDOC 06045 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted a post shipment 
verification (PSV) at Heyro Chemical Company Limited 
(Heyro), Lot 12, North Tsing Yi, Kowloon, Hong Kong. 
The item in question is synthetic resin tenite acetate 
exported to Heyro on July 29, 2006 and valued at USD 
71, 492.  The ECCN listed on the Shippers Export 
Declaration is EAR99. Items properly classified as 
EAR99 may be exported and reexported license-free to 
virtually all destinations worldwide. The exporter is 
Eastman Chemical Company of Kingsport, Tennessee. 
 
¶3.  The ECO visited Heyro at the address referenced 
above on November 20, 2006 and met with Mr. Anthony 
Khong, Sales Manager and Mr. Norman Wong, Executive 
Director of CM Holdings (the holding company that owns 
Heyro).  Mr. Khong and Mr. Wong provided background on 
Heyro and its business, which involves the sales and 
distribution of chemicals to the optical parts 
manufacturing market and to other trading companies in 
Hong Kong.  Mr. Wong stated that Heyro is one of 
several companies that form the CM Holdings Group (more 
background can be found at www.cmholdings.com). 
Besides Heyro Chemical Company, Limited, CM Holdings 
controls Heyro Optical Co. Limited (manufacturer and 
distributor of eyewear in Hong Kong and mainland 
China), Sealand Environ-tech Co. Ltd. (environmental 
services provider), and Leung Wan Kee Shipyard Limited. 
 
¶4.  Mr. Khong stated that the shipment in question had 
been sold to Eleung Limited, an eyewear manufacturer in 
Hong Kong for production of eyewear in Hong Kong.  Mr. 
Khong produced for the ECO an invoice reflecting the 
sale of tenite cellulose acetate to Eleung Limited in 
Hong Kong dated October 10, 2006 as well as a 
corresponding delivery order also dated October 10, 
¶2006. 
 
¶5. At the time visited, Heyro appeared to be a suitable 
recipient of the commodities shipped since Heyro 
cooperated with the PSV and provided all requested 
information concerning the use and final disposition of 
the shipment.  At the same time, the ECO was not able 
to inspect the subject item as it had already been 
delivered to Heyro's customer, Eleung.  Consistent with 
guidance on reporting of PSVs where the items cannot be 
physically inspected, the ECO recommends that this PSV 
be classified as Limited.
