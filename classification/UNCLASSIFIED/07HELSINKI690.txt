SUBJECT: FINNISH MINISTER WIRED ABOUT WIREC 2008 
 
REF: STATE 80334 
 
¶1. (U) Minister of Trade and Industry Mauri Pekkarinen is 
very interested in participating in the 2008 Washington 
International Renewable Energy Conference (WIREC 2008) next 
March.  According to Henri Backman, Senior Advisor in the 
Ministry of Trade and Industry, Pekkarinen would like to see 
a sample schedule of the Conference as soon as possible.  A 
strong advocate of renewable energy sources, Pekkarinen is 
also interested in possible speaking opportunities during the 
Conference.  Following the conference, Pekkarinen likely will 
travel to California to learn about renewable energy 
production on the west coast.  Pekkarinen will also likely 
visit FinNode, Finland,s business promotion office in San 
Jose. 
 
¶2. (U) According to government sources and press accounts, 
Pekkarinen plans to introduce in Finland a &feed-in tariff8 
scheme that will drive Finnish renewable energy production by 
requiring a fixed, above-market price for energy from 
renewable sources.  Pekkarinen believes that current 
market-based measures are insufficient to meet the EU,s 
lofty renewable energy targets. 
 
¶3. (U) Post is highlighting WIREC 2008 in public diplomacy 
outreach efforts, especially those related to climate change.
