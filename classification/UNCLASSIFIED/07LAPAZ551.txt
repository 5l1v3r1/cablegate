¶1. (U) At approximately noon February 27, a Venezuelan 
Hercules that was reported to be carrying disaster assistance 
arrived in El Alto.  When Bolivian journalists attempted to 
film the Venezuelan crew unloading the cargo, the Venezuelans 
prohibited them from filming the plane (citing the 
protections of a "convention" with the GOB), asked for the 
journalists' film, and briefly detained the journalists on 
site.  The journalists protested and said publicly that they 
did not deserve to be mistreated by the Venezuelans.  They 
further commented that if the Venezuelans were bringing 
disaster assistance to Bolivia, they should not have had 
anything to hide.  The footage appeared on the February 27 
evening news. 
 
¶2. (U) A high level Bolivian air force official apologized to 
the journalists later in the day, stating that the Bolivian 
air force supports and coordinates with the press.  He said 
in this case "we let down our guard," calling the event a 
"misunderstanding."
