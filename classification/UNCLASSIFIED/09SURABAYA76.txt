Summary. 
 
U.S. NAVY'S OBVIOUS COMMITMENT 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶2. (U) Indonesia welcomed the world's navies to North Sulawesi 
for IFR 2009, "Sail Bunaken".  Thirty five warships from 15 
nations participated in the final parade of ships and aircraft, 
led by the USS GEORGE WASHINGTON.  An additional 19 countries 
sent delegations, with 15 Chiefs of Navy or their 
representatives participating.  China sent one warship and Rear 
Admiral Su Zhiqian, Commander of the South Sea Fleet, who 
represented the Chief of Navy; Australia sent one warship, an 
oiler, a survey vessel, a customs ship, and its Chief of Navy; 
Japan sent three destroyers; and India sent two warships and 
Vice Admiral Nirmal Verma, Flag Officer Commander-in-Chief, as 
the representative of the Chief of Navy.  U.S. CNO Admiral Gary 
Roughead, speaking on behalf of the assembled Naval chiefs, 
praised Indonesia's initiative in hosting the event as an 
opportunity to bring the navies of the world together to discuss 
shared security and prosperity. 
 
¶3. (U) The size and dominance of the U.S. Navy's participation 
in Sail Bunaken did not go unnoticed by any of the participants 
or the media.  Indonesian officials in particular welcomed this 
clear demonstration of the U.S. Navy's interest in strengthening 
cooperation with Indonesia.  As the GEORGE WASHINGTON steamed in 
front of the reviewing stand, the Indonesian delegation, led by 
the Coordinating Minister for Defense and Security, saluted the 
carrier and its crew.  As four planes launched from its deck, 
the estimated tens of thousands of spectators lining the shore 
broke into a sustained standing ovation.  After the GEORGE 
WASHINGTON and three additional U.S. warships had passed in 
single file, the remaining ships steamed past in parallel lines. 
 The USS MCCAMPBELL concluded the warship parade. 
 
A POSITIVE NEWS STORY 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The GEORGE WASHINGTON, its aircraft, and its four support 
ships dominated media coverage of "Sail Bunaken."  The U.S. Navy 
organized a VIP flight, which included six members of the press, 
out to the GEORGE WASHINGTON.  Similarly, the Navy invited the 
press to tour the USS MCCAMPBELL when it was docked in Bitung. 
Both ship visits generated overwhelmingly positive press 
reports, with the trip to the aircraft carrier garnering 
headlines such as "Spectacular Attraction!", "Wow, How Huge," 
and USS GEORGE WASHINGTON Amazed Manado." 
 
¶5. (U) Media coverage of "Sail Bunaken" focused almost 
exclusively on the U.S. Navy in general and the USS GEORGE 
WASHINGTON in particular.  MetroTV, for example, broadcast a 
report from the deck of the GEORGE WASHINGTON on the weekend 
following the event, while papers throughout Indonesia carried 
special first-hand accounts of their reporters' "dream come true 
opportunity" visit to the carrier.  The U.S. Navy's willingness 
to invite the media on board their ships and offer members of 
their crews for interviews paid huge dividends in positive media 
coverage and goodwill.  The only complaint came from business 
owners disappointed that the vast majority of ships did not 
allow their sailors to disembark, and those that did stayed in 
Bitung rather than travelling to the provincial capital Manado, 
thus limiting the anticipated economic windfall.
