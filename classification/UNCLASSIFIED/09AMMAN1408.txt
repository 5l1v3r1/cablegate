SUBJECT: FY 2009 Julia Taft Refugee Fund Proposal for Jordan 
 
Ref: State 14280 
 
¶1. Summary:  The Christian and Missionary Alliance Church in Jordan 
has requested Taft Fund assistance to purchase medication and 
equipment.  The grant would support the operations of an existing 
health care clinic in Amman, which serves Iraqi refugees and 
Jordanians in need.  The Church has been working with Iraqi refugees 
since the Gulf War by providing basic medical care and humanitarian 
assistance.  Iraqi refugees in Jordan have stated that a major 
concern is inadequate primary health care resources and medication 
for chronic illnesses.  The Church's proposal would address this 
concern and post recommends a USD 20,000 award to fund the clinic's 
work.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. The Christian and Missionary Alliance Church established the 
"Hope Clinic" in 1991 to provide basic medical services.  (The 
organization also provides food and other types of non-food items 
(NFI) to Iraqi refugees in Jordan through other programs.)  Over the 
past 18 years, the clinic has provided thousands of Iraqi refugees, 
many of whom are not served by UNHCR or other NGO's, with free 
primary health care and medication.  The clinic is well- managed and 
has a good reputation with UNHCR and other organizations active in 
the field of refugee health.  The clinic participates in UNHCR-led 
outreach, reaching potential beneficiaries through word of mouth and 
direct contact with Iraqi refugees. 
 
¶3. Background:  The twice weekly "Hope Clinic" seeks to address 
Iraqi refugee concerns in Jordan by providing primary health care. 
Currently, the clinic serves 170 patients per week, 75 percent of 
whom are Iraqis and the remainder of whom are Jordanians in need. 
The clinic also provides patients with informational brochures and 
conducts medical seminars.  The clinic is run by three volunteer 
medical doctors, (two Americans and one Dutch doctor), with three 
volunteer nurses and three volunteer staff members.  In addition, 
private church donations pay for operational costs and clinic 
maintenance. 
 
¶4. Proposal: A request has been submitted for USD 20,000 from the 
Taft Fund to purchase new blood pressure cuffs, one-touch glucometer 
strips and lancets, hemocue test strips, urine dipstick test strips, 
a wall mounted electric otoscope, multivitamins for adults and 
children, and general medications. 
 
¶5. RefCoord recommends funding this proposal for the full amount of 
USD 20,000 and confirms that the proposal fulfills the requirements 
for Taft Fund consideration per reftel instructions.  This is an 
existing program with an excellent reputation that would clearly 
benefit from additional resources to better serve their patients 
from the Iraqi refugee community in Jordan.
