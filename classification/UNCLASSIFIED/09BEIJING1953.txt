SUBJECT: INFORMAL PROPOSAL FOR U.S.-CHINA BILATERAL INTERAGENCY 
COUNTERTERRORISM EXCHANGE IN MID-SEPTEMBER 2009 
 
¶1. On 10 July 2009 Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) External 
Security Division Director Xia Jingge informally proposed a 
bilateral interagency exchange on counterterrorism issues in 
Mid-September 2009.  Director Xia suggested the exchange should be 
jointly led by Director General for External Security Affairs Wang 
Min and S/CT Benjamin. 
 
¶2.  As proposed, the exchange would include officials at the Deputy 
Director General level or below from the Ministry of State Security, 
Ministry of Public Security, People's Liberation Army, People's Bank 
of China and their appropriate U.S. counterparts.  Director Xia 
proposed holding the exchange in Washington D.C. from September 
14-16.  This would include a day of meetings on September 14, field 
trips to FBI and CTC facilities on September 15, and sightseeing on 
September 16. 
 
¶3.  Director Xia emphasized that this should be a strictly bilateral 
exchange, not tied to any ongoing multilateral counterterrorism 
work.  He added that this was an informal proposal to obtain 
Washington's initial reaction before proceeding with any further 
planning.
