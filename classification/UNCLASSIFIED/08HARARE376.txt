¶3. Signals or Smoke Screen, State-Media Floats Idea of Government Of 
National Unity... In an unexpected development, the 
government-mouthpiece The Herald ran an editorial this week by a 
well-known pro-government commentator that called for SADC to 
mediate negotiations between ZANU-PF and MDC-Tsvangirai (MDC-T) for 
a transitional government of national unity (GNU) with President 
Mugabe at its head.  It also recommended that the "progressive 
international community," represented by the "US/UK establishments," 
act as the third key player in the negotiations.  It called on all 
stakeholders to recognize and accept that the March 29 elections had 
not produced an outright winner in the presidential race and that it 
was unlikely that the on-going recount would substantively alter 
that position.  The editorial disappeared off The Herald's website 
in the course of the day and a government spokesman denied the 
government was considering a GNU. 
 
According to reports in the April 25 edition of The Independent, 
SADC is pushing for a GNU as a solution to Zimbabwe's political 
crisis, arguing that the anticipated presidential election runoff 
expected sometime in May would not end the impasse.  MDC-T Secretary 
General Tendai Biti said the proposal in The Herald should be seen 
as a reflection of ZANU-PF's thought process, contending that it 
showed ZANU-PF knew Mugabe could not win a runoff.  There were 
reports that soon after the March 29 elections Mugabe realized he 
had lost and was close to coming to terms with MDC-T over a GNU and 
a transition plan; however, senior regime insiders fearing for their 
 
HARARE 00000376  002.5 OF 003 
 
 
own future nixed the idea and rolled-out a campaign of violent 
retribution to whip the electorate into submission ahead of a second 
round of voting.  See Harare 0367. 
 
¶4. No End To Post-Election Violence... Gangs of war veterans and 
ZANU-PF youth continue a state-sponsored terror campaign in rural 
areas; burning homes, beating opposition supporters in public, and 
forcing attendance at ZANU-PF rallies.  ZANU-PF thugs and some 
security forces are also victimizing and intimidating urban 
opposition supporters.  Over 450 victims have required medical 
treatment for injuries related to post-election violence. 
Opposition and human rights groups report shortages of critical 
supplies and resources necessary to assist the growing population of 
internally displaced persons.  Post is working closely with other 
international donors and partners to assist.  See Harare 0359. 
 
¶5. Recount Results Trickle In... A contentious recount of 23 
constituencies expected to la3 
7Q repeated in recent weeks that it 
would not participate or honor a re-run or recount, but its party 
polling agents were present at the recount centers, as were SADC and 
local election observers.  Consensus speculation is that ZANU-PF 
called for the recounts in order to pad President Mugabe's 
embarrassingly low support and wrestle control of the House of 
Assembly back from the opposition, which won a majority in the lower 
house for the first time ever.  ZANU-PF needs to swing at least nine 
seats back to its side to regain the majority.  So far, the recount 
has failed to change any of the previously declared outcomes. 
Quoting well-placed ZANU-PF sources, The Independent reported on 
April 25 that "things were not going according to plan" and that the 
recount was now an "exercise in futility." 
 
¶6. UN Human Rights Officials Visit Harare... On April 24, donors in 
Harare met with two visiting representatives of the UN Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), David Johnson, the 
Regional Representative for Southern Africa based in Pretoria and 
Tsatsu Dawson, the Zimbabwe desk officer at OHCHR Geneva.  Dawson 
 
SIPDIS 
explained that the GOZ last year refused to agree to the posting of 
a Human Rights Officer in Harare, but that OHCHR hoped to use a 
series of visits to make a contribution during this difficult 
period.  The current visit was focused on helping the UN country 
team and Human Rights NGOs deal with the situation, which Johnson 
referred to as a "burning crisis."  Johnson and Dawson were meeting 
with the human rights NGO community and were very interested in the 
donor field visits (see Harare 0359).  Donors were skeptical about 
Johnson's description of OHCHR efforts to create a government-led 
clearing house for human rights complaints.  However, they agreed 
heartily with his statement that, at the moment, the most urgent 
issue in Zimbabwe is the human rights crisis, not the political 
situation, and that human rights progress is essential to arrive at 
a political solution. UN ResRep Dr. Zacarias, surprisingly, said 
many of the right things on the human rights situation here. 
 
¶7. Chinese Ship With Arms For Zimbabwe On Its Way Home... The An Yue 
Jiang, which was carrying arms destined for Zimbabwe, is now 
returning home, with its cargo, after the shipment was vilified in 
the international press and, more significantly, in the region. 
 
¶8. Government Postpones COMESA Summit... Dodging potential 
embarrassment, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced this week 
the postponement of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern 
Africa (COMESA) Summit that had been scheduled to take place on May 
5-15 in Victoria Falls, due to "the uncompleted electoral process." 
Zimbabwe is about to assume the chairmanship of COMESA. 
 
¶9. Substantial Salary Increase For Zimbabwe Defense Forces (ZDF) 
Personnel... ZDF personnel received a substantial real salary 
 
HARARE 00000376  003.5 OF 003 
 
 
increase in April. A Warrant Officer who had been earning Z$8 
billion/month got Z$25 billion. Even in real U.S. dollar terms, the 
increase was significant, going from US$190 four weeks ago, using 
the parallel exchange rate for cash, to US$250 today for a Warrant 
Officer. The Zimbabwe Republic Police did not get any increase. 
 
¶10. Don't Tell The Americans You're Hungry... The Operation of Hope 
surgical team departed Harare this week after completing 81 free 
corrective cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries on its third visit 
to Zimbabwe.  At a celebration for hospital staff, parents, 
patients, and the team, one grateful father told us the hospital 
administration had warned parents not to complain to the Americans 
about hunger.  He also said that he, his wife and infant would stay 
on another night at the hospital and depart early the next day 
rather than risk a beating at the bus station if they arrived home 
at night.

Economic and Business News 
-------------------------- 
 
¶11. Zimbabwe Dollar In Freefall... The Zimbabwe dollar is in another 
freefall phase, having dropped from Z$82 million:US$1 cash rate 
eight days ago to Z$100 million:US$1 today.  The depreciation 
largely reflects the dire shortage of foreign exchange on the local 
market.  We hear repeatedly from exporting companies and NGOs that 
the Reserve Bank has raided their Foreign Currency Accounts, most 
likely to finance the recent election and associated give-aways. 
 
¶12. Tobacco Auction Floor Opening Delayed... Zimbabwe's famous 
tobacco auction floors failed to open as planned this week, 
bedeviled by disagreement between growers and government over the 
tobacco support price and arrears to farmers for the foreign 
exchange portion of last year's crop.  Farmers said they will not 
deliver their crop until the government has met their demands for 
payment and guaranteed a viable support price. 
 
¶13. Bleak Outlook For Cairns Holdings... Food sector giant Cairns, 
suffering from a negative cash flow,  might not be able to meet its 
interest obligations, according to asset manager Imara Capital, 
commenting on the company's interim results to February 29.  Volume 
declined by 38 percent in the period under review, mainly due to 
material shortages. Hyperinflation has eroded any benefit the 
company got from deeply subsidized BACOSSI funds last year.  See 
Harare 0365 and 0366 on how some U.S. companies are faring and 
Harare 0363 for an overview on coping in the business community. 
 
¶14. Yet Some Investors See Opportunity... In the midst of crisis, 
some investors see opportunity here that the risk averse abandoned 
long ago.  Banking on economic recovery and attracted to Zimbabwe's 
cheap price tags, investors are looking at sectors with 
international links or those that will benefit from an increase in 
consumer spending.  See Harare 0361.
