upholding Roadmap obligations.  In related news, PA chief negotiator 
Erekat responded in an exclusive interview with Al Ayyam to an 
Israeli proposal presented by Israeli President Peres to Solana, 
proposing a Palestinian state with temporary borders.  Erekat stated 
that the PA fully rejects the proposal and added that, "Israel is 
being manipulative." 
 
Al-Quds leads with news about Israeli Minister of Interior declining 
on June 11 to endorse a zoning plan for Jerusalem that includes the 
establishment of housing units for Palestinians in the southern part 
of East Jerusalem.  The Minister noted that the plan includes

exceeding the need," according to coverage.

reported in Israel. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs front page news citing DPA and Israeli daily Haaretz 
about Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's major policy speech

statements made by Hamas leader Misha'al to Al-Sharq Al-Awsat 
journal in Cairo on June 11 about President Obama's preconditions to 
pursuing talks with Hamas.  Misha'al is quoted stating that, "we 
sensed a new language and a new tone from the U.S. administration 
and we are waiting to see changes on the ground."  Misha'al urged 
the U.S. to drop preconditions and open dialogue with Hamas, "since 
President Obama keeps reiterating his readiness to open a new page 
with the Muslim world, why should he put preconditions on talks?" 
In related news, Al-Quds runs front page coverage of former U.S. 
president Carter's meetings with Syrian officials and Hamas leaders 
in Syria on June 11.  Carter called on the U.S. to pursue talks with

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under titled, 
"Palestinian dialogue leaves a positive impression, but we need 
action"(06/12):  "Since the U.S. administration is using new, 
positive language, the least we could do as Palestinians would be to 
start using new language of our own; one that would serve our goals 
and responds to Obama's positive stance on a regional solution... We 
should have a national Palestinian consensus government that 
formulates a unified position as quickly as possible so that we do 
not squander what we are being offered by the Americans..." 
 
2) Samih Shbayb opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the title 
"Netanyahu's speech" (06/12):  "In his upcoming speech, Netanyahu is 
expected to agree to the two-state solution and the Roadmap, but 
will, of course, never agree to halting settlement activities... 
However, in accepting a Palestinian state, Netanyahu will distance 
the concept of a state from all international agreements or specific 
requirements, ultimately rendering the two-state solution 
meaningless... It is now Obama's turn to appropriately respond to 
this deceiving and vague proposal."
