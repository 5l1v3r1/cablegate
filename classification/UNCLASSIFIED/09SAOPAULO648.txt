"The truth is late, but" 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (11-5) by senior columnist and 
influential commentator Eliane Catanhede says: "....The Pentagon 
has just sent another document to Congress saying the same thing: 
that said bases [in Colombia] do indeed serve as a foothold in 
South America and to keep an eye on countries not so friendly - 
such as Venezuela....[The document] has added to the distrust in 
Brazil and its neighbors that the focus of American military 
expansion in Colombia is not only internal, against the 
narco-guerillas, but also external to watch over and control the 
region.....It is up to Brazil and to UNASUL to ask Obama and Uribe 
three things: 1) Is the U.S. military presence in Colombia intended 
as a threat against Venezuela?, 2) Where are the 'formal 
guarantees' Lula has requested of Uribe and Obama that their aims 
do not overstep borders?, 3) Are Washington and Bogota making fools 
of us?"
