SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN PRE-LICENSE END USE CHECK ON 
APPLICATION 050179563 AND POST-SHIPMENT CHECK ON LICENSE 
050141626 
 
REF: A. MADRID 453 
     ¶B. MADRID 777 
 
¶1.  This is an action message.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2.  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post assistance in conducting a 
pre-license and post-shipment check for the export of 
battlefield effects simulators to Spain.  Post is requested 
to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3.  Reason for request: refs. A-B are post's unfavorable Blue 
Lantern responses regarding the export of night vision 
devices (NVD) to Spain.  The Spanish company ELINT, S.A. 
participated in these NVD transactions, and per refs. may 
have violated the terms of the export license and is 
currently under criminal investigation by the Spanish 
government.  ELINT, S.A. is the Foreign Consignee on both 
050179563 and 050141626.  PM/DTCC would therefore like to 
conduct a Blue Lantern check to confirm these requests with 
the Spanish government. 
 
¶4.  ACTION: Please contact the Foreign End User, the Spanish 
Army, and confirm its request for the exact quantities and 
specific types of commodities listed below.  Request the 
Spanish Army to provide purchase order documentation which 
lists all of the commodities it requested via ELINT.  Please 
match the Spanish Army list of requested commodities with 
ELINT's purchase order list of commodities reproduced below. 
Inform PM/DTCC of any noted discrepancies.  END ACTION.
