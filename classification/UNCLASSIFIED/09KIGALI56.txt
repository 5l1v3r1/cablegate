SUBJECT: TELEPHONE NUMBER CHANGES - U.S. EMBASSY KIGALI AND RWANDA 
 
¶1. Changes to Rwandan telephone numbers will be implemented 
beginning February 1, 2009.  Currently there are three types of 
phone numbers in Rwanda: ten-digit Rwandatel Cellular; eight-digit 
MTN Cellular; and six-digit Rwandatel land line numbers. 
 
¶2. All phone numbers will be migrated to ten-digit numbers beginning 
with a zero.  When calling from outside Rwanda, the leading zero 
will be dropped.  Following are explanations for calling Rwanda from 
another country. 
 
A) Rwandatel cellular numbers already have ten digits and will 
remain the same. 
 
B) MTN will use '78' in their new phone numbers. Examples are: 
 
Old Number            New Number 
 
250 0830 3479         250 788 303479 
250 0300 0222         250 783 000222 
 
C) Rwandatel will add '252' preceding its six-digit land line 
numbers, phasing in the change throughout the month of February. 
We intend to send a separate telegram as soon as the implementation 
date for this change to Embassy land line numbers is confirmed. 
Once the change goes into effect, the Embassy pilot line will change 
from 250 596400 to 250 252 596400.

Kigali will be available on these cell numbers:
