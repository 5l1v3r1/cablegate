¶1. (U) This is a PRT Karbala cable. 
 
¶2. (U) Sayed Ahmed al-Safi, Head of the Al Abbas shrine office, 
conducted the Friday sermon at Karbala's al-Husain shrine.  The 
message of this sermon focused on government support of budget 
execution, security and inviting leaders around Iraq to attend a 
reconciliation conference in Karbala.  Local media coverage 
included Karbala Radio, and the following television channels; 
Karbala, Al-Iraqya, Al-Furat, and Al-Salam. 
 
¶3. (U) Al-Safi publicly admonished the GOI for having only 
released one percent of the 2007 budget to the provincial 
governments.  He mentioned softening the anti-corruption law in 
an effort to reduce GOI reticence to release the funds 
recognizing that the rules regarding misappropriation are 
strict.  He called for government officials to empathize with 
the people and respond more quickly to their need for public 
services.  Al-Safi continued with his four week focus on 
security reminding the GOI to stand against violence in Diyala 
and Anbar. 
 
¶4. (U) The upcoming tribal sheikhs conference was the second 
topic of discussion during the sermon.  He called for the 
meeting to be in Karbala or Baquba or Ramadi, but that the 
meeting needs to happen.  Al-Safi explained that regardless of 
the location of the meeting, those who have suffered from the 
terrorism and violence must attend.  Al-Safi reminds his 
congregation that Iraq's plurality is healthy. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Al-Safi calls on the people to support those 
serving in government who do so not for money or for power.  PRT 
reminds those interested in the sermon that currently 3ID is 
posting them as they become available on the following website:
