¶1. This message responds to reftel request for Embassy input on 
potential OPIC financing to Summit Associates Afghanistan, to 
support the expansion of its dairy operations with a 5000MT 
multi-purpose storage facility in Kabul and a 2000MT dry storage 
warehouse in Kunduz.  Both units will store finished milk and juice 
products destined for the Afghan consumer market. 
 
¶2. According to information from the Ministry of Agriculture, the 
Dairy Field Manager at the National Food and Agriculture 
Organization, and our own informal local market survey, there is and 
will continue to be a great demand for domestically produced dairy 
products in Afghanistan.  Summit is currently the only large-scale 
producer of UHT milk in the country. 
 
¶3. Summit Associates and its U.S. sponsor, Mr. Reha Celikay, are 
favorably known to State officers at post.  Embassy Kabul has no 
adverse information on Summit Associates or Mr. Celikay, with 
respect to potential ties to terrorism, money laundering, 
corruption, violations of law, or any other commercial and financial 
considerations.  We recommend the expansion proposal be given 
serious consideration in light of its positive impact on Afghan 
employment and the supply of more nutritious, vitamin-fortified milk 
to the country's children.
