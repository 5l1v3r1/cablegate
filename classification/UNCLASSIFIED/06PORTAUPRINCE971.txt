¶1.  Shooting stalled the unloading and delivery of oil May 17 
from the first PetroCaribe ship, which arrived in Haiti on 
May 13 (reftel A).  The ship was docked at Varreux, a port 
located near one of Port-au-Prince's most violent slums, Cite 
Soleil.  The captain of the ship reported bullets flying over 
the deck and stopped unloading the ship.  According to 
Minustah, gun shots were heard in nearby Cite Soleil but were 
not directed toward the terminal.  The port received no 
incoming fire.  Minustah considers the Captain's report 
impossible given the distance of the shots fired.  This 
caused only a minor delay, of less than one day. 
 
¶2.  Chevron (operating as Texaco in Haiti) security officials 
will be in Haiti June 1 to assess the situation and determine 
whether the next tanker, due to arrive as early as June 2, 
should offload at Varreux or not.  Minustah's message to 
Chevron is that Chevron should continue sending their tankers 
to Varreux as nothing has changed in recent months.  If 
anything, the situation has improved since the Brazilians 
replaced the Jordanian contingent in Cite Soleil.  Chevron 
officials told us they agree with this assessment but have 
for some time been wary of the security of Varreux due to its 
proximity to Cite Soleil and the possibility of stray gunfire. 
 
¶3.  Comment: This incident, and any others regarding 
PetroCaribe since President Rene Preval signed the agreement 
May 14, has received no attention from the media.  Haitians 
have noted, however, that electricity in Port-au-Prince has 
improved since Preval's inauguration with 6 to 8 hours a day, 
usually late at night until morning in residential areas.
