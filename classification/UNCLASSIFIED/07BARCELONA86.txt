Begin text. 
 
Dear Mr. Robinson 
 
I am writing you with regards to the devastating fires, which 
are currently affecting California. 
 
In these difficult moments the Catalan Government would wish to 
express its solidarity and sympathy to all the American people 
and especially to those who have had to leave their homes behind. 
 
Yours truly, 
 
Josep-Lluis Carod-Rovira

 ¶2. (U) Comment:  Catalonia has developed a strong relationship 
with and fondness for all things California, and this note is a 
true expression of that sentiment.  The Parliament sent a 
delegation to visit the state several years ago and many still 
rave about it and are proud of the many similarities between the 
region and the state.  End Comment.
