Joint Press Statement by the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) 
and the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) on the Meeting of the 
Tripartite Mechanism 
 
Khartoum, 26 December 2006 
 
Tripartite Mechanism Meeting Clears the Way for UNMIS Support to 
AMIS in Darfur 
 
The way has been cleared for the United Nations Mission in Sudan 
(UNMIS) to start providing logistical and human resources support to 
the African Union Mission in Sudan.   UN military staff officers and 
police advisers deployed as part of the UNMIS Light Support package 
to AMIS will wear their national uniforms with blue UN berets and an 
AMIS armband.  The uniform to be worn by the UN staff officers and 
advisers was the final outstanding issue regarding the deployment of 
UN personnel to Darfur under the Light Support Package of assistance 
to AMIS. 
 
At today's third meeting of the Tripartite Mechanism, made up of 
UNMIS, AMIS, and the Government of Sudan, representatives of the 
three organizations resolved this one outstanding issue of the 
deployment of UN personnel in support of AU forces in Darfur. 
 
Under the Light Support Package, UNMIS is to provide 105 military 
staff officers, 33 police advisers and 48 civilian staff to assist 
AMIS in Darfur.  The United Nations and AMIS teams today provided 
the Government of Sudan representatives with a list of the names of 
the forty-three UN military staff officers and twenty-four police 
advisers who will form the first UN group to be deployed to Darfur 
in the next few days.  The GoS team assured the group that the men 
can be deployed with immediate effect.  The balance of UN military 
and police officers will be deployed in the coming weeks. 
 
In addition to the personnel which will be provided to AMIS under 
the Light Support Package, a further US$ 21 million of equipment 
will also be provided to the African Union peacekeepers.  This 
equipment will include computers, water tankers and public 
information equipment. 
 
The tripartite mechanism will meet again on 10 January at the AMIS 
headquarters in Khartoum.
