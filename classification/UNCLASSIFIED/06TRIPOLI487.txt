SUBJECT: PROPOSED COOPERATION WITH LIBYAN BOARD OF MEDICAL 
SPECIALTIES IN TRAINING AND BOARD CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  On August 30, 2006, ESTH officer and Dr. Mustafa 
Mansour of the Navy Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU 3) in Cairo, 
visited the Libyan Board of Medical Specialties to follow up on 
the July visit of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
Deputy Secretary Alex Azar.  DepSec Azar and the Board agreed to 
collaborate, expand and improve Libya's medical board 
certification process with particular attention to creating 
recognized certifications in sub-specialties.  The Libyans were 
challenged by ESTH officer to determine what sort of cooperation 
or workshop programs would benefit the board, and they responded 
with two reasonable proposals.  The first was a basic discussion 
on the benefits, feasibility and technology associated with a 
telemedicine program.  The second proposal was for the Libyans 
to fully fund a series of workshop visits by U.S. physicians, 
capable of conducting sub-specialty focused workshops in a 
continuing education capacity, with a secondary goal of 
discussing and evaluating the board certification criteria in 
the relevant sub-specialty during the visit.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------- 
Medical Board Hopes for Sustained Mutual Cooperation 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  DepSec Azar met in July with President of the Libyan Board 
of Medical Specialties Dr. Mustafa M. Zaidi.  Dr. Zaidi was not 
able to attend the August 30 Embassy coordination session, but 
his priorities were presented by the three following board 
members: 
 
--Dr. Elhadi Hussein, Consultant of Urology and Andrology to 
Libyan Board of Medical Specialties 
--Dr. Abdulhalim Shebani, Specialist Surgeon (ENT), Director of 
International Cooperation for Libyan Board 
--Dr. Gasem Amar Baruni, Chairman of Examination Committee, 
Libyan Medical Board 
 
The Board had retained a great deal of excitement from Mr. 
Azar's visit, and was adamant about not "letting the fire grow 
cold" on U.S. cooperation with the Libyan medical community. 
The group's proposals are focused and reasonable, but they are 
concerned that their practical efforts will be fruitless if they 
do not lead to institutional cooperation between the Libyan 
government and the U.S. government.  They expressed their 
understanding of the importance of personal relationships in 
such cooperation, but showed an insightful knowledge of how 
sustained institutional / federal cooperation could enhance the 
board's capabilities and international standing. 
 
------------ 
Libyans Propose Enhancing Medical Board Certification Process 
------------ 
 
¶3.  The board members proposed "concrete" programs to enhance 
Libya's medical board certification process, first, expanding 
Libya's ability to certify (with credibility) physicians in 
sub-specialties.  Visiting U.S. physicians would be asked to 
conduct workshops with a secondary focus on examining and 
enhancing the Libyan Board's certification process for the 
relevant sub-specialty.  The Libyans offered to fully fund the 
travel, lodging and expenses of the visiting physicians.  A 
workshop on laparoscopic techniques is the boards first 
priority.  ESTH officer asked if there were particular 
techniques or procedures in which they were interested, or if 
they were interested in a more general endoscopic workshop.  The 
board restated that a general workshop on laparoscopic 
techniques was ideal, and that they preferred a U.S. physician 
capable of evaluating/improving their related sub-specialty 
board certification process.  They were also open to any 
technological aspects that could be added to such a presentation 
such as partnering with equipment manufacturers to demonstrate 
or provide equipment familiar to the visiting surgeon. 
 
¶4.  As a sample visit itinerary, the Libyan Board suggested the 
following: 
 
--A one week visit to Tripoli fully funded (Travel, Lodging and 
Per Diem) 
--Conduct workshop lectures in the Libyan Medical Board 
conference auditorium. 
--Perform Rounds in a local hospital with the aim of discussing 
management practice and bedside manner 
--Lead or observe a series of surgical procedures (at Physicians 
discretion) 
--(ESTH Officer also recommended cadaver labs or animal labs if 
the surgeon so desired) 
--Evaluate and discuss board certification procedures and 
examinations.  Provide feedback and recommend areas for 
improvement. 
 
------------ 
Libyans Seek Assistance in Developing Telemedicine Program 
------------ 
 
¶5.  In addition, the board members were interested in discussing 
medical information technology issues, with regard to developing 
a comprehensive telemedicine program for Libya.  ESTH Officer is 
working with local medical IT providers and the Embassy Family 
Nurse Practitioner, a former telemedicine unit manager, to 
arrange a presentation to the board detailing hardware, software 
and hospital infrastructure requirements necessary for such a 
program. 
 
 
¶6.  The board mentioned several long term proposals that were in 
line with DepSec Azar's July discussions, including a visit for 
4-6 of the board members to the U.S. to work toward 
strengthening their board evaluation and examination procedures. 
 ESTH Officer agreed to pass the request to HHS and OES.  Please 
advise department interest in pursuing such a program. 
 
------------ 
Next Steps: 
------------ 
 
¶7.  ESTH Officer will meet with the Libyan Board again on the 
week of September 17-21 (before the beginning of Ramadan) to 
discuss the proposed cooperative programs.  The Libyan Board 
made clear their desire to maintain the momentum generated by 
Mr. Azar's visit, and showed their good faith by offering to 
fund the travel of U.S. physicians/surgeons to conduct the 
workshops.  Their proposed visit to the U.S. would provide an 
excellent opportunity for the board members to discuss their 
processes and procedures and observe, first-hand, U.S. 
evaluation and examination procedures.  The trip would also 
engender a great deal of good-will within the Libyan health 
community.  If OES, HHS or NAMRU 3 have additional insights or 
particular interest in participation in such programs, please 
notify Embassy Tripoli. 
 
¶8.  Although the Libyan Board has agreed to support visa 
issuance for travel related to their proposals, any U.S. 
travelers planning travel to Libya should allow a minimum of 
eight weeks for visa approvals to be processed.  Similarly, 
Libyans must travel to Embassy Tunis to apply for visas, and any 
proposals for activities including Libyan travel to the U.S. 
should factor a minimum of eight weeks lead time for visa 
issuance.
