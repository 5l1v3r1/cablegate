REF: SECSTATE 80911 
 
¶1. (U) Post concurs with DOL's inclusion of pornographic 
products from the Russian Federation on the revised EO 13126 
list, see reftel.  Both official and non-government sources 
confirmed that the commercial, sexual exploitation of 
children in the Russian pornography industry continued to 
thrive despite the addition to the Criminal Code in 2003 of 
Article 242.1, which prohibits the manufacture and 
circulation of materials with pornographic representations of 
minors.  According to statistics collected by the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs (MIA), the manufacture and sale of child 
pronography increased by a factor of ten over the past few 
years.  In 2008, MIA registered 223 incidences of the illegal 
dissemination of pornographic materials or items involving 
minors.  MIA blocked over 150 websites in the first six 
months of 2009 for displaying pornographic content involving 
minors.  In a July interview with the BBC news agency, 
Russian human rights activists also noted the growth of 
rights violations connected with the dissemination of child 
pornography.
