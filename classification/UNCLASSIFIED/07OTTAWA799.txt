Emboff delivered demarche to Deborah Price, Special Advisor in the 
UN and Commonwealth Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade (DFAIT).  Price reaffirmed Canada's 
opposition to Zimbabwean bid for the Chairmanship of the 16th 
Session of the CSD and noted that Canada's Foreign Minister has just 
approved a series of demarches expressing their concern which will 
be delivered in various capitals over the next few days.  Price 
mentioned that Canada hopes to build a consensus among African 
countries to set aside their claim on the Chair for the 16th session 
of the CSD.  Should Canada not be successful in gaining that 
consensus Canada will vote against the Zimbabwean candidacy.
