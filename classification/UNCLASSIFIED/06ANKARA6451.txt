¶1. Turkey's National Security Council (NSC) held its bi-monthly 
meeting on October 31.  Internal and external developments affecting 
Turkey's national security topped the agenda of the meeting. 
Negotiations on Iran's nuclear program after the UN Security Council 
resolution of July 31 were discussed in detail, while the importance 
of solving the issue through diplomatic channels was underlined. 
Developments in the south Caucasus and the PKK situation following 
the terrorist organization's announcement of a unilateral ceasefire 
beginning October 1, 2006, were among other issues discussed in the 
meeting. 
 
Turkey's Security Relations with Other Countries 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. Lebanon: Turkish Naval Forces Command deployed a frigate to 
Lebanon on October 6 to serve at the Naval Forces Command of the 
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  19 officers and 203 
non-commissioned officers and privates were assigned to staff the 
frigate.  The Foreign Ministry announced on the same day that Turkey 
was planning to deploy 600-700 troops to Lebanon.  A 7-member mine 
detection team of the Turkish Armed Forces was deployed to Lebanon 
on October 17.  Two ships carrying 95 military construction 
engineers and equipment were deployed to Lebanon on October 19.  The 
engineering squadron consisted of 261 personnel, including 237 
soldiers and 24 civilians. 
 
¶3. Afghanistan: Turkish Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul released an 
official statement noting that Turkish troops will not assume combat 
duties against the Taliban and Al-Qa'ida or resume responsibilities 
in the south or other parts of Afghanistan, but only in the Kabul 
area.  Turkey, which initiated a joint command of ISAF Central 
Command covering the Kabul region with Italy and France on August 6, 
will hold the rotating leadership from April-December 2007, during 
which time Turkey will increase its troop strength from 620 to 900. 
 
 
¶4. Armenia: The Turkish General Staff (TGS) announced on October 11

jets and a CASA plane were harassed four times by Greek fighter jets 
in international airspace over the Aegean Sea on October 12.  The 
Turkish F-16 fighter jets were on a training mission while the CASA 
plane was on its way to Antalya from Incirlik/Adana, according to 
the TGS.  TGS reported three other interception incidents against 
Turkish F-16 jets over the Aegean Sea on October 16, according to 
ANA. 
 
¶6. China: Air Force Commander of the People's Republic of China 
General Qiao Qingchen met Turkish Air Forces Commander General Faruk 
Comert in Ankara on October 18.  Stating that both countries aimed 
at boosting bilateral cooperation in several areas, Gen Comert noted 
that the two countries were conducting joint activities regarding 
technological developments and exchange of information.  Gen Comert

tenders in Turkey, according to the semi-official Anatolian News 
Agency (ANA).

¶7. The three-member Executive Defense Committee (Prime Minister, 
Defense Minister, Chief of the General Staff), Turkey's top 
decision-making body on defense industrial procurement, was to 
convene on October 17, but was postponed when Prime Minister Erdogan 
was hospitalized after collapsing in Parliament.  According to press 
reports, the Committee was expected to decide whether to accept a 
bid for the production of up to 91 ATAK helicopters from South 
Africa's Denel or Italy's Mangusta (the two finalists in a tender in 
which no US company participated), or whether to cancel the tender 
in favor of an FMS purchase from Boeing or Bell.   Commenting on the 
ATAK tender after postponement of the meeting, Defense Minister 
Gonul said Turkey might consider procuring up to 150 helicopters. 
The Executive Defense Committee meeting has been re-scheduled for 
December 12. 
 
¶8. Kalekalip Company, which manufactures parts for Boeing and for 
the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35), is to produce Turkey's first 
unmanned aerial vehicle, known as a 'spy plane,' under contract with 
the Defense Industry Undrsecretariat (SSM), according to the 
left-leaning daily Cumhuriyet. 
 
¶9. During his official visit to the US, Defense Minister Gonul said 
Turkey plans to purchase 30 F-16 Block-50 aircraft from the United 
States.  He further noted that the government wants Turkish defense 
industry involvement in the manufacture of those jets. 
 
¶10. Turkey's Aselsan Electronic Industry Co. signed a contract worth 
2.8 million USD with the Armed Forces of Uruguay on October 18 to

¶11. The Black Sea and Caspian Business Group inaugurated a new 
bi-monthly, English-language defense magazine called 'Defence 
Turkey.'  The magazine contains information about the defense 
industry, private and government-owned defense companies, and the 
Turkish Armed Forces.
