¶1. (U) This is a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) Karbala 
cable. 
 
¶2. (U) SUMMARY: On June 29, PRT Karbala met with Provincial 
Council Chairman (PCC), Abdul-A'al Al-Yasiry, to discuss his 
vision for economic development and the conference in Lebanon. 
The PCC was returning from a two day Provincial Council 
Chairmans' conference in Najaf in which Baghdad, Diyala and the 
southern provinces participated.  The southern PCCs had gathered 
to talk about the provincial powers law, the Samarra mosque 
bombing and they explored ways in which the PCCs could speak 
with one unified voice to the central government.  Al-Yasiry 
expressed his concern about movement within the province of the 
PRT and recommended that it restrict its movement to the 
Governance Center only, where he explained it would be able to 
meet with all of it's the necessary contacts.  The PCC expressed 
interest in attracting a wide variety of foreign investors in an 
effort to bring foreign capital and expertise to the business 
community in Karbala. As a former businessman and student of 
law, the PCC has a very modern approach to leading his province. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (U) The PCC, met with the PRT at the Regional Embassy Office 
in al-Hillah on his way back from a Shi'a dominated Provincial 
Council Chairmans' conference in Najaf province.  While the 
specifics of that meeting are not available, al-Yasiry promised 
to send the meeting notes to the PRT at his earliest 
convenience.  The PRT expects these notes to include the key 
recommendations sent to the Council of Representatives about the 
Provincial Powers Law. (SEPTEL)

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MODEL 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Al-Yasiry's vision for economic development in Karbala is 
based on attracting foreign companies with their expertise and 
capital.  He views local development as important, but 
incorporated within the context of foreign investor activities 
which he deems to be more efficient for generating jobs and 
investment dollars.  In concert with this vision, al-Yasiry 
traveled to Kuwait and to Lebanon meeting with already 
established Iraqi businessmen and, using their connections and 
expertise, was able to generate interest in investing in 
Karbala.  The two biggest projects currently on the horizon are 
a French-Lebanese cement company that is looking at building a 
facility in Karbala, and the International Airport request for 
bid that was published two weeks ago.

LEBANON TRADE CONFERENCE 
------------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) Making use of the network of ex-patriot Iraqis to 
generate business leads and identify potential investors is 
evolving into the PCC's economic development strategy. The 
Lebanon-Karbala trade conference is a prime example of this.  At 
this time, the conference is slated for September at the 
earliest.  The first plans for the conference did not include a 
company exposition element.  During the course of the June 29 
meeting, the conference concept evolved to include an element of 
time and space dedicated to encouraging Iraqi and foreign 
companies to exchange contact, product and service information. 
Al-Yasiry is interested in capitalizing on USG support for the 
conference and will continue to keep PRT Karbala informed of 
developments. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT: The PCC's business roots show through with his 
current drive to attract foreign investors.  He cautiously 
skirted the conversation about the PRT being denied access to 
the province (REFTEL) and recommended that the PRT use the 
Governance Center as a meeting point with local contacts.  While 
this in theory is feasible, access to the Governance Center for 
PRT contacts would reveal their cooperation with the USG, and 
expose them to risk of intimidation or worse.  The PRT continues 
to seek creative alternatives to meet and engage our local 
counterparts. 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED: PRT Karbala thanks Embassy Beirut 
for their continued support.  The PRT will provide further 
information about the September Conference as it becomes 
available.  At this time it appears that the scope of the 
conference is very small and more closely resembles a meeting 
with potential investors and Karbala government officials.
