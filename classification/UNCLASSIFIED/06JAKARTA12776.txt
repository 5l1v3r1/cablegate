SUBJECT: TNI ANNIVERSARY SPEECHES EMPHASIZE REFORM AND 
DEMOCRACY 
 
¶1. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudoyono and 
Commander-in-Chief (Panglima) Air First Marshal Djoko Suyanto 
urged the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) to continue along the 
path of reform as the TNI celebrated its 61st anniversary on 
October 5.  The speeches exhorted the TNI to complete its 
transformation toward modernization and professionalization 
while upholding human rights, democratic principles and the 
rule of law. 
 
PRESIDENT YUDHOYONO'S SPEECH 
 
¶2. Praising the TNI for its patriotism and dedication to the 
defense of the country, President Yudhoyono said that the 
challenges of the future would require development and 
modernization of the TNI toward "a more professional, 
effective and credible" entity.  This development and 
modernization should be done gradually, in line with the 
state's financial capabilities, toward achieving "the 
required minimum power" necessary to defend the country, 
including dealing with contingencies and preventing possible 
threats.  At the same time, scientific and technological 
advances were changing the nature and form of modern warfare 
and TNI doctrine, organization, tactics and techniques must 
evolve to respond to these changes. 
 
¶3. Acknowledging the imperative for economic growth as the 
essential ingredient underpinning for the country's overall 
progress, Yudhoyono exhorted the TNI to support the country's 
democratic institutions, the rule of law and good governance. 
 Indonesia needed to present a positive image to the world to 
underpin the constructive role it wanted to play 
internationally.  "All elements of the nation, including the 
TNI, should participate in and contribute to the achievement 
of a developed, resilient and prosperous Indonesia," he urged. 
 
¶4. Noting that Indonesia's UNIFIL peacekeeping contingent 
would soon depart for Lebanon, Yudhoyono hailed the 
contribution as a demonstration of Indonesia's desire to play 
a role in settling conflicts in the Middle East.  He exhorted 
the peacekeepers to do their best in the assignment and 
convey a positive image, in line with Indonesia's past 
peacekeeping contributions.  Yudhoyono also thanked the TNI 
for its services to Indonesia in disaster relief and 
humanitarian assistance. 
 
PANGLIMA SUYANTO'S SPEECH 
 
¶5. Suyanto also commended the TNI for its role in disaster 
relief operations and the approaching deployment of the 
850-man peacekeeping taskforce Garuda XXIIIA to Lebanon.  The 
TNI could also take pride, he said, in its ongoing internal 
reform, which involved establishing policies and practices 
consistent with the Military Reform Law of 2004 and 
Indonesia's democratic order.  Similarly, the TNI had nearly 
finished the process of winding up its business operations as 
a major step on the road toward becoming a more professional 
military.  At the same time the military must assist in 
combating illegal logging and illegal fishing. 
 
¶6. The professionalism that the TNI sought to attain, Suyanto 
stated, was a synergy of the professional ability of its 
personnel and technological optimalization, allowing the TNI 
to perform its defense role without neglecting human rights, 
democratic principles and the interests of the civilian 
environment in which the TNI operated. 
 
COMMENT 
 
¶7. The speeches were given considerable coverage in the 
media, which highlighted precisely these themes.
