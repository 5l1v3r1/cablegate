SUBJECT: Request for Source/Origin Waiver: Procurement of Four 
Vehicles for the Ecuadorian National Police SIU Unit 
 
¶1.  Issue: Post requests a source origin waiver from 
 
geographic code 000 (United States only) to geographic 
 
code 935 (Special Free World) to permit the procurement of 
 
vehicles in the Host Country local market for operational use by 
the Ecuadorian National Police's Sensitive Investigative Unit 
(SIU). 
 
 
 
Cooperating Country: Ecuador 
 
 
 
Authorizing document: LOA dated August 21, 2009 
 
 
 
Project: Sensitive Investigative Unit - SIU 
 
 
 
Nature of funding: Sensitive Investigative Unit Funds FY-08 
 
 
 
Description of commodity: Foreign-manufactured vehicles 
 
 
 
Quantity - 4 2010 Chevrolet Aveo Emotion, 4 door sedan, T/M 1.6L, 
A/C, manual transmission 
 
 
 
Approximate total value: USD 66,000.00 
 
Origin: Special Free World 
 
Source: Ecuador 
 
Contracting agent: GSO 
 
 
 
¶2. Discussion: These vehicles will be used for surveillance 
operations by the National Police Special Investigations Unit.  The 
SIU is a highly effective unit of the National Police's Anti-Drug 
Directorate and cooperates closely with DEA Quito office.  For the 
security of undercover personnel and operations, it is necessary 
for the SIU to use nondescript vehicles that are locally common 
rather than the more conspicuous and distinctive U.S.-manufactures 
vehicles.  The requested vehicles are a needed fleet expansion. 
 
 
 
¶3. Recommendation:  For the reasons stated above, we recommend 
approval of this request for a source/origin waiver to permit 
acquisition of these project vehicles in Ecuador. 
 
 
 
¶4. Please expedite reply. Thank you.

Section, U.S. Embassy, Quito, Ecuador.
