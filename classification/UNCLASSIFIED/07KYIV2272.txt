REF: STATE 119837 
 
¶1. On September 6, EconOff delivered reftel points to 
Viacheslav Voloshyn, Director of Ukraine's Maritime Security 
Agency.  Voloshyn stated that in principle the State Maritime 
Agency, under the direction of the Ministry of Transport, 
supported future cooperation with the Departments of Homeland 
Security and Energy to develop means for properly scanning 
all U.S. bound cargo originating in Ukraine by July 1, 2012. 
 
¶2.  Voloshyn added that his agency and the Ministry of 
Transport were very interested in specific details concerning 
the types of scanning equipment that should be installed at 
ports.  He also requested a cost estimate for scanning 
material, noting that there was no money in the current 
budget allocated for scanning equipment.  He also indicated 
his interest in visiting ports in Europe or the U.S. where 
scanning equipment was already in use. EconOff told Voloshyn 
post would follow up with DHS and DOE colleagues to answer 
his questions.
