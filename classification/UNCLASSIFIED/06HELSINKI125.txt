SUBJECT: U.S. CANDIDATE FOR ICAO SECRETARY GENERAL: FINLAND 
RECEPTIVE BUT NON-COMMITAL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 15012 
 
¶1. (U) Post discussed the reftel demarche with officials at 
the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Finnish Civil 
Aviation Administration (FCAA), and left behind relevant 
biographic material on U.S. candidate for ICAO Secretary 
General William Voss. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Matti Tupamaki, who directs the Air Transport 
Authority and international issues of the FCAA, was 
reluctant to share his views or to commit support for the US 
candidate.  He responded that they had not yet made their 
decision and added that they were unlikely to discuss their 
position prior to the vote. Nevertheless, he said they were 
"carefully considering it."  He acknowledged that Mr. Voss 
is "a very strong, qualified and experienced candidate." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Tupamaki noted that he would forward this 
information to their ICAO delegate in Montreal, Lars 
Lovkvist.  Note:  Lovkvist is known to the Embassy and a 
close friend of the US.  He might be more forthcoming on the 
Finnish position and more receptive to ours, if contacted by 
our ICAO representation.
