We passed reftel advisory to GOC officials at the Department 
of Finance and Foreign Affairs Canada (the Korea Desk, 
Counter-terrorism office and legal affairs) as well as to the 
Canadian Bankers' Association (CBA).  Finance will convey the 
message to the Office of the Supervisor of Financial 
Institutions for dissemination to regulated financial 
institutions nationwide.  Finance confirmed that work is 
ongoing between the US and Canada to improve coordination and 
information exchange on Section 311 institutions.  The CBA 
security officer has sent the advisory to members of the 
Anti-Money Laundering Committee and anticipates that member 
firms will contact their correspondent banks.
