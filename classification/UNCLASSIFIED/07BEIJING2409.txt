Lien Chan to Visit Beijing 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) spokesman Yang Yi announced 
that Honorary KMT Chairman Lien Chan will attend the Third 
CCP-KMT sponsored "Cross-Strait Forum on Trade and Culture" 
April 28-29 in Beijing.  Lien will also visit Henan to attend 
a ceremony paying respect to ancestors.  Asked whether 
President Hu would meet with Lien or if new KMT Chairman Wu 
Poh-hsiung would accompany Lien, Yang said the details are 
still under discussion between the two parties.  Issues 
addressed in the forum will include direct flights, education 
and tourism. 
 
No Comment New Chairmen of KMT, MAC 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Asked for comment on the appointment of pro-Taiwan 
independence Professor Chen Ming-tong as chairman of Taiwan's 
Mainland Affairs Committee, the spokesman expressed the hope 
of all those on both sides of the Strait for peaceful and 
stable development.  When asked for his impression of Wu 
Poh-hsiung and the differences between Wu and Lien Chan, Yang 
said has had no contact with Wu, but can ask his colleagues 
for their impressions. 
 
Constitution Reform 
------------------- 
 
¶4.  In response to a question about "constitutional reforms" 
which propose revising the "state name, territorial 
definition and national flag," Yang voiced the Mainland's 
strong disapproval of such ploys used by Chen Shui-bian, the 
DPP and "Taiwan independence" forces to "manipulate public 
opinion" and achieve de jure Taiwan independence.  The 
Mainland ardently opposes any person or group who by any 
method attempts to separate Taiwan from China. 
 
DPP's Yu Calls on U.S. to Clarify Taiwan Policy? 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5.  Asked for comment on DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun's appeal 
yesterday to the United States to clarify its "One China, One 
Taiwan" policy, the spokesman stated that it is an immutable 
fact that there is only one China including both the Mainland 
and Taiwan. 
 
Taiwan Investment Federation to Open in Beijing 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶6.  The spokesman confirmed that the Federation of Taiwan 
Compatriots Investments and Enterprises will hold a meeting 
of representatives on April 15 and a formal opening ceremony 
on April 16.  Responding to accusations that the attendance 
of TAO Director Chen Yunlin and Economic Director He Shizhong 
at the events will taint activities in some way, Yang said 
the Federation may invite members of various departments and 
ministries to participate as advisors, council members and 
other positions to build a bridge of communication between 
the Federation and Government.  Such cooperation safeguards 
the rights and interests of the member enterprises and 
promotes their development. 
 
Taiwan's Restrictions Harm Own Industries 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  Yang agreed with media commentary that Taiwan's 
semi-conductor industry, in light of Intel's decision to 
invest USD 2.5 billion in building a 12-inch IC fabrication 
plant in Dalian, will be harmed by two Taiwan companies'

previous inability to enter the Mainland's market because of 
restrictions of the Taiwan authorities.  Yang expressed 
regret over such hindrances by the Taiwan authorities, 
holding that the Mainland has an open market and welcomes 
investment from Taiwan's semiconductor industry. 
 
Olympic Torch Route to be Released Soon 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  At the invitation of the China Taipei Olympic Committee, 
Vice Chairman Hu Jiayan of the Mainland's China Olympic 
Committee traveled to Taiwan yesterday to attend the Tenth 
Cross-Strait Olympic Committee Forum on Athletics and 
Exchange and discuss the issue of the Olympic torch. 
According to the International Olympic Committee's request, 
China will announce this month the route of the Olympic torch 
for the 2008 Games. 
 
Mini-Three Links 
---------------- 
 
¶9.  Asked for comment on reports that Taiwan authorities 
recently announced the opening of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu to 
residents of Fujian Province, the spokesman reminded 
journalists that the Mainland approved travel for Fujian 
residents to these three cities in October 2004, but the 
Taiwan authorities maintained prohibitions on travel to 
Penghu.  Yang hopes Fujian residents can visit Penghu at an 
early date and urges relevant departments to support Fujian 
Province in carrying out preparations.
