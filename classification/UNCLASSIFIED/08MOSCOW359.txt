¶1.  (U) Summary:  Mikhail Andreyev, Director General of Okhotnik and 
Rybolov, confirmed the delivery of rifles imported under license 
05-1009959.  Subsequently, we verified the bona fides of Okhotnik 
and Rybolov and recommend it as a reliable end-user of United States 
Munitions List (USML) items.  Local Russian law enforcement reports 
that Okhotnik and Rybolov carries all of the necessary permits to 
import and sell firearms and told us that they did not have any 
derogatory information on the conduct of this firm.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) In an April 11, 2007, meeting, Okhotnik and Rybolov General 
Director Mikhail Andreyev confirmed to us the delivery of the rifles 
under license 05-1009959.  Andreyev told us that all 31 rifles had 
already been resold.  The company's customers are all domestic 
hunters. 
 
¶3.  (U) Andreyev showed us where the rifles were stored, which is on 
the premises of the store location at ulitsa Miklukho-Maklaya, 
Building 18, Entrance 1, in Moscow.  The store has an alarm system 
linked to the police and each weapons rack/cabinet has its own 
security alarm.  The store has reinforced walls and very heavy 
double-doors with high security locks in the weapons storage areas. 
 
 
¶4.  (U) Okhotnik and Rybolov was established in 2004 and has been 
importing foreign hunting weapons since 2005.  Principal officers 
include Andreyev and the owner, Vladimir Shchigorets.  Both live in 
the Moscow area.  Besides the United States, the store imports from 
Austria, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, and France.  Andreyev told us 
most customers of Okhotnik and Rybolov were from the Moscow area and 
all were Russian Federation citizens.  The company maintins an 
accurate registry book of its clients with detailed records. 
 
¶5.  (U) Andreyev provided us with copies of licensing documents that 
give Okhotnik and Rybolov the right to import weapons.  We scanned 
and emailed these documents to PM/DTCC Adam Arnett. 
 
¶6.  (U) The International Relations Division of the Moscow City 
Police Department confirmed the bona fides of Okhotnik and Rybolov 
and informed us they have no derogatory information regarding this 
company.  Okhotnik and Rybolov has all necessary licenses and 
permits to conduct its business. 
 
¶7.  (U) Andreyev and Shchigorets told us they were familiar with the 
restrictions governing the import of USML commodities, and in 
particular the prohibition of unauthorized re-export.  We recommend 
Okhotnik and Rybolov as a reliable end-user of USML items.
