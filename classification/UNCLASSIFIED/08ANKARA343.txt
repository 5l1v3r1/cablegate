¶1. (U) Turkish ground operations inside of northern Iraq 
continue, with Turkish troops supported by artillery and air 
strikes as well as helicopter gunships. 
 
¶2. (U) In a public announcement late on February 22, the 
Turkish General Staff (TGS) reported that operations are 
being carried out by Jandarma forces under the command of the 
Second Army, with the support of Turkish Air Force aircraft 
as well as helicopters and artillery.  According to the 
announcements, 24 PKK terrorists and five Turkish military 
were killed in a clash that took place on February 22.  The 
TGS also states that at least 20 more terrorists were killed 
by Turkish artillery and helicopter gunships, while an 
unknown number of additional PKK were likely killed or 
wounded by air strikes and long-range artillery fires.  The 
military reports destroying many man-made and natural 
shelters used by PKK terrorists, as well as a considerable 
amount of ammunition, equipment and food supplies.  The TGS 
statements also report that PKK terrorists, including some 
leadership, are fleeing south in panic. 
 
¶3. (U) Reacting to intense media speculation concerning the 
ongoing operation, the TGS issued other public announcements 
on February 22 criticizing media outlets for publishing false 
information and misleading photographs concerning the goals 
of the operation as well as the size and composition of the 
military units involved.  The TGS statements also requested 
that credence not be given to statements in the press by 
unnamed military officials, and urged media organizations not 
to draw attention to announcements made by PKK-related 
organizations. 
 
¶4. (U) Turkish newspapers continue to speculate on the size 
and scope of the ground operation, which is reportedly 
code-named "Operation Sun," involves 2000 to 10000 troops, 
and will last up to two weeks.  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak 
and nationalist-oriented Cumhuriyet report that the U.S. knew 
of an impending ground operation up to two weeks in advance 
and that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ADM Mullen 
sent Vice Chairman GEN Cartwright to Ankara on February 13 to 
discuss the details.  All papers attribute to Secretary Rice 
comments that the U.S. "supports Turkey and is in solidarity 
with the government of Turkey," but that "Iraq's stability 
must not be harmed." 
 
¶5. (U) Columnists from the left to the right of the political 
spectrum, including both secularist and Islamic leaning 
commentators, support the operations but call for the 
government to take political, economic, and diplomatic steps 
to deal with the Kurdish problem.  Yalcin Dogan of mainstream 
Hurriyet writes that "this is the 25th land operation since 
the 1980s and we are still talking about land operations.  I 
hope that this land operation leads the government to talk to 
the Iraqi government, to initiate dialogue with (Masoud) 
Barzani, and to develop a comprehensive plan."  Derya Sezak 
of mainstream Milliyet writes that "Turkey cannot achieve 
results unless military actions are attached to a civilian 
solution that includes democratic measures and promotion of a 
culture of peaceful coexistence."  Oral Calislar of 
nationalist-oriented Cumhuriyet writes "historically, Turkey 
has treated the Kurdish issue from the security perspective 
as a threat.  The policy so far treats the Kurds as a 
community that needs to be assimilated.  Even if these 
military operations succeed, the Kurdish issue will not be 
over.  Political and democratic steps are needed."  Ali 
Bayramoglu of Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak writes "operations 
are fine, but even if they are successful, what about taking 
democratic steps to address the Kurdish issue?"  This type of 
military operation may harm Turkey's relations with the EU. 
It will be interesting to see if democratic steps will follow 
military action."
