¶1. Scioff delivered reftel's talking points to Otavio Trindade of 
the Ministry of External Relation's Division for Environmental 
Policy and Sustainable Development.  In response to the points, 
Trindade stated that the GoB would take the USG's request under 
consideration, but pointed out that Brazil's final decision will 
hinge on consensus with the GRULAC (Group of Latin American and 
Caribbean Countries).  Brazil, he noted, does not produce methyl 
bromide and will ban its use in 2007, as the country has developed a 
variety of alternatives.  Therefore, Brazil's position at the MOP 
(Meeting of the Parties) will be one of principal; although, he 
explained, many other developing countries in the GRULAC do not have 
access to high-priced alternatives and still require methyl bromide 
use. 
 
¶2. During the conversation, Trindade explained that Brazil's 
overarching goal at the MOP is to pass a motion for the 
multi-lateral fund to undertake a study project supporting the 
collection and disposal of antiquated ODS-containing refrigerators. 
Endorsing this study might provide leverage and garner GRULAC 
support for the USG's CUE.
