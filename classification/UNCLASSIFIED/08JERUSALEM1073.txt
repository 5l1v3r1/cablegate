French President Sarkozy's visit to Israel attracts front page 
headlines in the three dailies.  In his speech before the Knesset on 
June 23, Sarkozy emphasized the need for the establishment of an 
independent Palestinian state, freezing settlement activities, 
resolution of the refugee question and recognition of Jerusalem as 
the capital of the two states.  He also stressed his country's 
support for Israel and its security.  During his meeting with 
Jerusalem leaders, Sarkozy underscored that Jerusalem should be a 
city where residents live in peace.  In related coverage, 
Palestinian presidency spokesperson Abu Rudaynah comments that, 
"Palestinian Authority President Abbas praised Sarkozy's attitude 
towards the state [Palestine], Jerusalem and settlements." 
 
All dailies report that Israeli Premier Olmert and Egyptian 
President Mubarak will meet on June 24 in Cairo to discuss the 
Hamas/Israel truce in the Gaza Strip and Cairo's efforts to mediate 
a prisoners' exchange deal between Hamas and Israel.  Separate 
reports note that French President Sarkozy has called on Hamas to 
release captured Israeli soldier Shalit.  The papers also highlight 
that Israel has postponed its decision to act on a prisoner exchange 
deal with Hizbollah.  In related coverage, all dailies report on 
Israeli efforts to reopen the Gaza crossing points of Nahel Oz and 
Sofa. 
 
All dailies express outrage over the work of Israeli bulldozers in 
East Jerusalem's Beit Hanina neighborhood to break ground for a new 
section of the separation barrier that will allow for the 
construction of 1,300 new settlement housing units.  Hatim Abdul 
Qadir, advisor to the Palestinian Prime Minister for Jerusalem 
Affairs, reported confrontations between residents and Israeli 
soldiers which led to the injury of the head of the local council of 
Beit Hanina.  In separate reporting, Al- Ayyam's front page notes 
that the Palestinian Government is planning new projects to assist 
Palestinians in regions that have been adversely affected by the 
separation barrier. 
 
The results of the Palestinian Authority's Ministerial Council June 
23 meeting in Ramallah is front page news.  Al-Quds reports that the 
Council, "asserted that Israel should reopen the crossing points, 
end the siege and expand the truce [to the West Bank]."  The paper 
also highlights that the June 24 donors conference in Berlin, "is 
expected to raise $178 million dollars towards Palestinian security 
programs and other priorities."  Al- Hayat Al- Jadida adds that the 
Council expressed concern over failure to make "true progress" in 
peace negotiations with Israel. 
News from the Nahr al-Barid international donor conference in Vienna 
on June 23 also captures headlines.  European and Western countries 
pledged $122 million towards reconstruction of the refugee camp 
while Arab countries pledged to contribute 50% of rehabilitation 
costs at a later time.

¶1.  Independent Al-Ayyam carries its daily editorial under the 
title, "The truce may help to achieve unity or may deepen 
division"(6/24):  The truce may help to make comprehensive national 
dialogue successful, end division and restore unity.  It may also 
lead to a deepening and perpetuation of division... this depends...

on the way the fighting Palestinian opponents behave.  Will they 
grant victory to the higher national interest and common 
denominators over their personal, factional, and group interests? 
Then, the truce may be a positive factor. If, however, the opposite 
happens, in other words, if Hamas perceives of the truce as 
strengthening its movement and giving it a stronger position in 
national talks they may...  not show the necessary flexibility to 
start a comprehensive national dialogue and make [talks] 
successful...  The question is:  How will Hamas use its power?  In 
the direction of national partnership or towards autocracy, control 
and exclusion? 
 
¶2.  Independent Al-Quds runs an editorial by Muhammad Shakir 
Abdullah entitled, "The American whispering that Israel does not 
hear" (6/24):  The subject of settlements was the focus of 
negotiations between U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and 
Palestinian officials during her last visit to the region.  A 
Palestinian source said that 60% of these negotiations were spent 
discussing the intensive settlement activities in the West Bank, in 
particular, and in Jerusalem, in general.  Following these talks, 
Rice spoke 'strongly' about settlement activities which violate 
agreements regarding Israeli- Palestinian negotiations and prejudice 
[the negotiations'] outcome.  [She] pointed out that the United 
States, on this issue, does not differentiate between Jerusalem and 
the West Bank because settlements are settlements anywhere in the 
lands occupied in 1967.  However, Rice's 'strong' speech did not 
move any hairs on the heads of Israeli officials who did not retreat 
from their plans.  On the contrary, they stuck by them... halting 
settlement activities will require a loud and stern American voice 
similar to that of former Foreign Minister James Baker...
