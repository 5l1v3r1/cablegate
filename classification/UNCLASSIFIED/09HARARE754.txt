On the Political/Social Front 
----------------------------- 
 
¶1.  Donors Pledge USD 70 Million to Education... In a September 14 
ceremony attended by the Charge and numerous other heads of mission, 
the Educational Transition Fund announced it is investing USD 70 
million in education. The fund will put textbooks and learning 
materials back in schools and guarantee school fees for low-income 
children.  The initiative will increase the ratio of learning 
materials from an estimated one textbook for every ten students to 
one book for every two pupils within the next year.  The U.S. plans 
to contribute USD 1 million and to provide 100 sets of reference 
books to secondary schools. Other contributing donors to the fund 
that will be managed by UNICEF and the Ministry of Education include 
the UK, EC, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, New 
Zealand, and Germany. Although Zimbabwe once had one of the best 
education systems in sub-Saharan Africa, examination pass rates have 
fallen significantly in recent years and more than half of primary 
school pupils do not go on to secondary school. 
 
¶2.  Constitutional Process Clears One Hurdle...  On September 11, 
ParliamentQs Constitutional Select Committee on the Constitution 
announced the 17 MPs who will chair individual thematic 
sub-committees.  The announcements broke a month-long delay as 
ZANU-PF had failed to put forward their nominees.  The chairs were 
divided proportionately based on political party representation. 
Next steps include choosing deputy chairs from civil society and 
then rounding out the sub-committees with other MPs and civics. 
Once completed, each sub-committee will be composed of 70 percent 
civics and 30 percent MPs.  The sub-committees will conduct 
nationwide outreach efforts to elicit public feedback on key 
constitutional issues. 
 
¶3.  Hate Speech Intensifies in State Media... This week the ZANU-PF 
mouthpiece The Herald appeared to spew even more vitriol than usual. 
 On Tuesday the front page headline QMDC-T wants sanctions to stay 
claimed Tsvangirai wants to use Western sanctions as leverage 
against ZANU-PF. A page-two article quoted Army Commander Philip 
Sibanda telling soldiers that QZimbabweQs detractors are using some 
QSibanda telling soldiers that QZimbabweQs detractors are using some 
NGOs and pirate radio stations to spread false and hate messages 
that will lead to rioting, despondency and eventually cause war. 
On Friday spin-doctor Tafataona Mahoso bashed the MDC in an article 
entitled QHow MDCs Brought DisasterQ Q claiming that NGOs and MDC 
formations have bribed street kids to mount urban riots disguised as 
a labor movement.  On Thursday the MDC called on the State media to 
stop using newspapers to spread dissension and hate.

¶4.  ZBC Exec Blasts Embassy for Visa Refusal... This week, with 
Department concurrence, we refused the CEO of the Zimbabwe Broadcast 
Corporation a visa to attend UNGA.  CEO Happison Muchetere, who has 
led ZBCQs anti-MDC and undemocratic programming, read the refusal 
letter on TV and criticized the U.S. government for allegedly Qnot 
recognizing the inclusive governmentQ and for acting Qholier than 
thou. 
 
¶5.  Another MP Arrested, Released... Makoni South MP (MDC-T) Pishai 
Muchauraya was arrested on September 15 on charges of assaulting his 
friendQs maid with a wooden plank and fracturing her arm in the 
presence of the police at a police station. The assault allegedly 
took place on August 13, but the woman did not file a complaint 
until August 21, and her arm was not examined until September 7.  On 
September 16, Muchauraya was released on free bail.  The three 
police officers alleged to have witnessed the assault refused to 
testify against Muchauraya, as they deny the assault ever took 
place.  After refusing to testify, the police officers were charged 
with failure to protect a complainant in their presence. 
 
¶6.  Police Bar Labor Union March... On September 12, police in 
Harare defied a court order and barred the Zimbabwe Congress of 
Trade Unions (ZCTU) from holding a march commemorating the policeQs 
brutality in crushing the unionQs 2006 protest for better working 
and living conditions.  Heavily armed police cordoned off the road 
leading to the venue of the commemoration. Union official Japhet 
Moyo said the police action Qconfirms that political freedoms are 
still circumscribed. 
 
¶7.  ZANU-PF Youths Beat Teacher...  A teacher in rural Manicaland 
was beaten by a group of ZANU-PF youth for failing to heed the 
Zimbabwe TeachersQ Union (ZIMTA) call to go on strike.  Teachers 
across Zimbabwe have reportedly been threatened or locked out by 
ZANU-PF youth, war veterans, and sympathetic headmasters.  See 
Harare 752. 
 
¶8.  Farm Attacks Continue... Attacks on white-owned farms continued 
this week.  Police detained an Al Jazeera film crew together with 
Ben Freeth when they attempted to visit FreethQs farm in Chegutu. 
South African citizen Louis Fick reported that thugs led by Reserve 
Bank Deputy Governor Edward Mashiringwani overran his farm last 
week, refusing to allow farm workers to give food or water to his 
pigs and cattle.  The police refuse to take action in these cases. 
 
¶9.  Peace Returns to Once-Violent Mazowe Central... During a recent 
trip to Mashonaland Central, we were pleasantly surprised to see the 
tangible improvement in security in a rural area that was wracked by 
violence in 2008.  See Harare 734.

Economic and Business News 
-------------------------- 
 
¶10.  Government Takes Control of Meikles Group... There was more bad 
news this week for Zimbabwe's business climate when the GOZ 
intervened in a long-running local business dispute by appointing an 
Qintervened in a long-running local business dispute by appointing an 
administrator for Kingdom Meikles Limited, a blue-chip Zimbabwean 
firm with interests in retail, agriculture, and hospitality. 
Kingdom Meikles was about to disentangle itself from an unsuccessful 
merger involving businesses owned by the Meikles family and the 
Kingdom financial group.  Under an anti-corruption statute that 
allows the authorities to seize control of assets, the GOZ has 
alleged that Kingdom Meikles violated foreign exchange controls 
after the 2007 merger.  The MDC's co-minister for Home Affairs, 
Giles Mutsekwa, reportedly signed the order, but the MDC later 
released a statement criticizing the move. 
 
¶11.  BP and Shell to Exit Zimbabwe According to press reports, BP 
and Shell will sell their Zimbabwean assets to Engen Petroleum of 
 
HARARE 00000754  003 OF 003 
 
 
South Africa and KenolKobil of Kenya. The move will be the first 
high-profile exit from Zimbabwe by a major foreign investor since 
the inclusive government came to power in February this year. 
 
¶12.  Zimbabwe Dollar Will Not Make an Early Return Seeking to 
encourage foreign investment, Minister of Finance Tendai Biti 
assured delegates at this week's two-day Mining Investment 
Conference in Harare that the Zimbabwe dollar will not make an early 
return. He said re-introduction of the national currency would have 
to wait until the economy can generate sufficient foreign exchange 
for the countryQs needs. 
 
¶13.  Another South African Firm Invests in Zimbabwe South African 
commodities trader and investor Metmar said it had finalized a deal 
to buy 40 percent of Zimbabwe Alloys and its subsidiary, Chromecorp 
for R450 million. The money will be used to inject much needed 
capital to restore the companyQs mining, processing and production 
capacities. 
 
¶14.  Good News That Isn't... This week's Financial Gazette proudly 
 
reported that Zimbabwe has moved up a step in the World Bank's 
rankings of 183 countries on the ease of doing business.  Zimbabwe 
ranks at 159 this year, just ahead of Afghanistan, and came in at 
160 last year.  The newspaper helpfully notes that the number of 
countries ranked below Zimbabwe has increased by two because the 
World Bank's survey now covers more countries. 
 
¶15.  New Digs for Gono... Elsewhere in the press, it was reported 
this week that RBZ Governor Gideon Gono has moved into a new 
112-room mansion on the outskirts of Harare.  The Governor's new 
residence reportedly features an art gallery, a billiard room, a 
swimming pool with three islands, and four helipads. 
 
¶16.  Quotes of the Week: 
 
"We have not invited these bloody whites. They want to poke their 
nose into our own affairs.Q  --President Mugabe in his September 11 
address to the ZANU-PF youth wing, the day before meeting with a 
delegation from the EU. 
 
QWe are not as rough and racist as some people regard us. 
--President Mugabe at a Mining Conference on September 16. 
 
QThis country is safe; this country has laws which are still 
functioning.  I assure you, if you went to someoneQs home and stole 
you would certainly be arrested.Q  --Minister of Youth, 
Indigenization and Empowerment Saviour Kasukuwere addressing at a 
Mining Conference on September 16.
