Freight Initiative (SFI) as instructed ref A.  AIT/T

security.  Both had questions about how the new program 
would be coordinated with the Container Security 
Initiative (CSI) and the Megaports Program.  (Note: CSI 
has been implemented at the Port of Kaohsiung and Keelung 
Harbor.  Preparations are underway to implement Megaports 
at Kaohsiung.  End note.)  Econoff answered their 
questions using information in ref A and offered to 
arrange a meeting with Department of Energy Megaports 
Program officers, who will visit Taipei in late January, 
to provide further information about the new program.

Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) and 
the Executive Yuan Counter-Terrorism Office by telephone.
