¶1. This is an action request.  See paragraph 6. 
 
¶2. At a July 22 meeting, UNODC Operations Division Director Francis 
Maertens told Charge that UNODC seeks additional voluntary 
contributions to expand its anti-piracy programs off the Somali 
coast to additional countries in the region, and to extend UNODC's 
existing programs in Kenya, Tanzania and Seychelles beyond the next 
18 months. 
 
¶3. Charge learned from Maertens that the UNODC has received Euros 
1.7 million from the European Commission (EC) to fund its 
anti-piracy efforts in Kenya (e.g., building prosecution capacity), 
Tanzania and the Seychelles. In addition, UNODC expects an 
Australian donation of Aus$500,000, and has received some small 
initial funding, totaling less than $200,000, from Germany and 
France. 
 
¶4. However, those contributions will be sufficient to cover UNODC's 
anti-piracy programs in Africa for only 18 months.  UNODC has 
developed excellent relationship with the Kenya government, which 
has been pressuring it constantly for support.  UNODC hopes the EC 
would be willing to provide longer-term funding, but has not 
received any commitment beyond the 1.7 million Euros mentioned 
above. 
 
¶5. According to Mark Shaw, Chief of UNODC's Integrated Programming 
Unit in Maertens' Division, UNODC's assistance is needed in other 
countries in the region.  For example, Shaw mentioned that the U.S. 
Embassy in Yemen approached UNODC to inquire about possible 
technical assistance related to prisons in Yemen.  Shaw said that 
the EC funds could only be used in Kenya, Tanzania and Seychelles. 
Furthermore, UNODC has developed justice/governance proposals for 
Somaliland and Puntland, with a focus on piracy. 
 
¶6. Action Requested:  Mission seeks Washington clarification on the 
status of previous proposal to use some pariah funds to contribute 
to UNODC's anti-piracy activities.  We note that UNODC Ed Antonio 
Costa will travel to Kenya and Somalia beginning August 20, so a 
U.S. decision would be well timed.  End Action Requested. 
 
¶7. Comment:  UNODC has established itself as a useful player in 
Kenya and the region and deserves our support to expand its 
programs, possibly into other countries.  Its current work is 
complementary to current U.S. policy of supporting Kenya as it 
assumes the burden of prosecuting pirates and at the same time 
developing other alternative reliable venues for such prosecution. 
End Comment.
