NEW SCREENING PROCEDURES FOR POSSIBLE H1N1 INFLUENZA 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶5. (U) Effective May 11, 2009, Chinese Health and 
Quarantine (H&Q) authorities implemented new procedures to 
screen for the possibility of influenza among passengers on 
flights arriving from the U.S. Although you will be arriving 
on U.S. milair, we will need to assure the Chinese 
authorities that we have taken steps to confirm no passenger 
has H1N1.  This will consist of our having an Embassy medical 
professional board the aircraft after arrival then telling 
waiting Ministry of Health officials that the delegation does 
not show evidence of infection. 
 
------------------------------ 
Security and Threat Assessment 
------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (U) The threat level for all China posts is considered low 
for crime and medium for terrorism. 
 
¶7. (U) The Regional Security Office is not aware of any 
specific threat directed against any U.S. person or traveling 
delegation.  Should such information be developed, the 
Chinese security services are committed to advise the Embassy 
of pertinent information and to provide necessary security 
coverage. 
 
¶8. (U) China experiences a moderate rate of crime, including 
recent incidents ranging from petty theft to murder. 
Pickpockets are particularly active in crowded markets, and 
foreigners are often sought out as primary targets.  Petty 
theft from hotel rooms is uncommon, but visitors are advised 
not to leave valuables lying loose or unattended in their 
rooms.  It is the policy of this Mission that employees, 
their family members and official visitors to China must not 
knowingly purchase counterfeit or pirated products during 
their stay in China.  Also, foreigners may be approached in 
tourist areas by individuals seeking to exchange U.S. dollars 
or to sell pirated or fake products, such as compact discs, 
in violation of intellectual property rights laws.  These 
transactions are illegal, violate Post policy, and must be 
avoided. 
 
¶9. (U) Visitors are reminded to take necessary precautions 
in safeguarding sensitive material and information.  All 
non-USG facilities must be considered technically compromised 
 
BEIJING 00003253  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
and may not be used to discuss, process, or store classified 
information.  Telephone calls, e-mail, and Internet usage are 
routinely monitored and hotel rooms searched. 
 
¶10. (U) Travelers should be aware that previous visitors have 
reported that their unattended computers have been subjected 
to tampering.  The efforts may be directed toward obtaining 
information on the computers, but problems ranging from 
viruses left on their systems to hard drives, that are no 
longer functional have been reported.  Hotels and private 
Chinese Internet providers have in some cases given hotel 
guests "free" thumb drives for use with their computers.  The 
source and quality of these devices are unknown.  Such 
devices could contain malicious codes and viruses and should 
not be used on government computers.  Official visitors are 
reminded that non-inspectable electrical/electronic 
equipment, i.e., cellular telephones, laptop computers, 
personal digital assistants (PDAs), etc., may not be brought 
into the controlled access areas of the Chancery.  If a 
visitor intends to travel with USG-owned computers and 
equipment for use within the Chancery, please contact the 
Regional Security Officer at 86-10-8531-4111, or 
GormanB2@state.gov or MooreBM@state.gov, for information and 
guidelines. 
 
¶11. (U) Additionally, all classified and sensitive materials 
must be secured at the Embassy upon arrival in country.  All 
classified material must be brought into China via diplomatic 
pouch. 
 
¶12. (U) Passports and visas are required.  Americans 
arriving/transiting without valid passports and Chinese visas 
are not permitted to enter China and may also be subject to 
fines.  Visas are required to transit China on the way to and 
from Mongolia or North Korea.  Those visitors traveling to 
China on a single-entry visa should be reminded that trips to 
Hong Kong or Macau Special Administrative Regions are treated 
as a visit outside Mainland China.  If the traveler is 
planning to return to Mainland China after a visit to one of 
these two destinations on the same single-entry visa, they 
will be denied entry.  Visitors facing this dilemma will be 
required to apply for a new visa at the Chinese Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Office in Hong Kong to gain re-entry into 
Mainland China.
