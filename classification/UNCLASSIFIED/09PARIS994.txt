REF: A. STATE 74362 
     ¶B. PARIS POINTS FOR JULY 2 
 
¶1. (SBU) Deputy Chief of Staff in the interagency 
Afghanistan/Pakistan cell Yann Braem said July 22 that France 
had recently allocated 23 million Euros in non-military aid 
to Afghanistan this year for total civilian assistance of 
approximately 40 to 45 million Euros for 2009.  Around half 
of the 23 million Euros will fund agriculture and rural 
development projects, especially in the Kapisa region where 
the majority of French troops are serving.  France is 
planning to invest in short-, medium-, and long-term 
projects, with a current focus on more long-term agricultural 
schemes now that initial short-term infrastructure and 
agricultural supply projects are winding up.  Beyond Kapisa, 
discussions with Afghan authorities on funding nationwide 
education and health programs are ongoing.  Looking to 2010, 
France aims to consolidate civilian aid programs to ensure 
they remain consistent with Afghan priorities and to maintain 
close coordination with the U.S. PRT active in France's area 
of operations. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The expected deployment of French gendarmes under 
NTM-A, with a mission to train Afghan police, is expected to 
take place this fall once a framework agreement is concluded 
under NTM-A, and this will reflect another approximately 30 
million Euros in increased French assistance.  Laurent 
Legodec, another member of the Af/Pak cell, added that 
following the presidential elections in the fall, France 
wants to continue efforts to bolster the national government 
and to start discussions on how best to support the upcoming 
regional elections. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Legodec confirmed the plan to shift French forces 
currently in Kabul to Kapisa when Turkey takes over security 
responsibility for the capital region, in accordance with 
recent reports (ref B).  The GOF plans to augment the two 
current battalions in Afghanistan with an additional company 
of approximately 150 personnel and the creation of a new base 
in Naghlu, which is now under construction.  French troops 
would be deployed in Surobi (70 kilometers from Kabul) and 
Kapisa in the east and would be placed under the command of a 
French general in a Task Force.  France also intends to 
reinforce its capabilities by sending 8 Caesar cannons and 3 
of its "ultramodern" Tiger helicopters.
