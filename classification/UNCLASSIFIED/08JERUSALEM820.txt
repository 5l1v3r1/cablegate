Main Stories:

The dailies report that Bush is coming to the Middle East with low 
expectations of reaching an agreement.  Papers highlight Secretary 
Rice remarks that, "chances for reaching a peace agreement are not 
great."  Related coverage on Al-Quds' front page quotes Palestinian 
President Abbas' spokesperson Nimir Hamad suggesting that a 
tri-lateral meeting between the U.S., Egypt and the Palestinians in 
Sharm Al-Sheik may be held next week. Al-Quds also quotes head 
Palestinian Authority negotiator Ahmad Quray from his May 13 visit 
to Hebron that negotiations with Israel are "difficult."  In 
contrast, other Al-Quds reporting highlights comments by Israeli 
Premier Olmert that, "important understandings between Israel and 
the Palestinians have been reached." 
 
 
All front pages lead with photos and reports on the May 13 visit by 
Palestinian President Abbas to the "Camp of Return" in Ramallah. 
The camp was set up to provide a venue for events commemorating the 
catastrophe or Al Nakba.  All dailies highlight comments by 
Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad from a May 13 speech in Ramallah 
where he asks the rhetorical question, "How can Israelis celebrate 
while our people are suffering from the crimes of your settlers?" 
 
Comments by Quartet envoy Tony Blair's May 13 press conference 
appear in positive stories run on all front pages.  Blair stated 
that some Israeli checkpoints will be removed in the coming months 
and that a number of development projects will soon begin in the 
Palestinian Territories. 
 
According to the front pages of the dailies, representatives of 
Palestinian factions will be invited to Egypt next week to discuss 
"the zero hour," or definitive date for implementation of a 
Palestinian truce with Israel. The dailies also cite an Israeli T.V 
report that there is a "possibility" that Israel will accept a 
truce. 
 
 
The May 13 visit of Palestinian Interior Minister Al-Yahya to the 
West Bank city of Janin is given positive spin on an inside page of 
Al Quds.  The paper reports that Al-Yahya stressed Palestinian 
Authority determination to make the security campaign "hope and 
smile" a success.  During his visit to Janin, Al-Yahya met with 
Palestinian Authority security officials and spoke of the role of 
Israel in on-going security efforts.  "Israel has adopted the same 
policy as it did in Nablus," Al-Yahya stated, alluding to frequent 
incursions into the two cities that undermine the efforts of 
Palestinian security forces. 
 
Al-Quds reports on an inside page that the "Center for Jerusalem 
Studies" has called upon Arab, Palestinian and Muslim organizations 
to stop an Israeli plan to build a synagogue in the area of "Hamam 
Al-Ayn" in the Old City of Jerusalem.

BLOCK QUOTES:

¶1.  Independent Al-Quds ran its daily editorial entitled "We suggest 
that Bush visit a refugee camp" (5/14): "Bush will arrive in Israel 
today to participate in the celebration of its founding... Other 
leaders and European presidents will follow him to the same 
 
JERUSALEM 00000820  002 OF 002 
 
 
celebration thereby making it an historic event.  Meanwhile, 
everyone knows that the celebration that they are attending is the 
result of a catastrophe that Palestinians have been living through 
for sixty years.  Logic dictates that any president or leader has 
the right to participate in any celebration they want...  However, 
logic [also] suggests that [foreign participation in Israeli 
celebrations] will add too the complexity and sensitivity of what 
Bush and other leaders are trying to deliver [progress in peace 
efforts]..." 
 
¶2. Independent Al-Ayyam carries an op-ed by veteran columnist Hani 
Habib entitled, "Who said that Israel is interested in a truce?" 
(5/14): "... The Jewish state has set [truce] conditions that 
involve... Gaza without involving the West Bank because, not only is 
Israeli policy predicated on fueling internal Palestinian division, 
but it also involves different Israeli political and military 
calculations for the West Bank and Gaza.  All that we have witnessed 
shows that Israel is not interested in seriously considering 
Egyptian efforts for a truce.  Therefore [Israel] continues to 
demand [unreasonable] conditions and offer justifications for why it 
cannot accept [Egyptian mediated proposals.] ..."
