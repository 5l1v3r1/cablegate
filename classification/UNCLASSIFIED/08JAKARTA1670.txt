Excellencies: 
 
SUBJECT: ASEAN Disaster Preparedness and a Role for ARF 
 
I wish to acknowledge receipt of your proposed concept paper 
on the above subject, and to express appreciation to you and 
the U.S. Government for contributions in all efforts to the 
ASEAN disaster response and relief.  The support and 
assistance have significantly contributed to the 
strengthening of ASEAN disaster preparedness within both the 
ARF and the US-ASEAN Enhanced Partnership. 
 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, at the Fifteenth ARF 
 
JAKARTA 00001670  002 OF 002 
 
 
held on 24 July 2008 in Singapore, made a proposal to ARF 
Participants that the U.S. and the Philippines would co-host 
an ARF Disaster Relief Exercise, termed Voluntary 
Demonstration of Response (VDR), in 2009.  In this regard, I 
am of the view that we can integrate all elements mentioned 
in the proposed concept paper into the said multilateral 
exercise in 2009. 
 
I also hope that ASEAN instrument for emerging response and 
disaster relief can be built into the framework of the 2009 
Exercise. 
 
Please accept, Excellencies, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
/ S / 
Dr. Surin Pitsuwan
