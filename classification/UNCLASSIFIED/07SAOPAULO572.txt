SUBJECT: BRAZILIAN COMPANY BECOMES WORLD'S LARGEST BEEF PRODUCER 
WITH PURCHASE OF U.S. COMPANY SWIFT 
 
REF: SAO PAULO 18 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  The Brazilian company JBS-Friboi, the largest producer and 
exporter of beef in Latin America and the largest exporter of beef 
in the world, purchased 100 percent of Colorado-based Swift & 
Company for USD 225 million with the assumption of USD 1.16 billion 
in debt, giving the deal a total value of about USD 1.4 billion. 
The combined revenues of JBS-Friboi and Swift are approximately USD 
11.5 billion last year.  Swift is the third largest beef and pork 
processor in the United States and the largest beef processor in 
Australia.  With this purchase, JBS-Friboi becomes the world's 
largest beef producer, surpassing both Tyson Foods and Cargill. 
This acquisition gives the Sao Paulo-based company new access to the 
global market and the especially lucrative U.S. and Asian markets. 
The deal, which garnered a lot of attention and commentary in the 
Brazilian media, came as a surprise to many in the United States, 
who expected Swift to be sold all or in part to U.S. meat companies. 
 End Summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
BACKGROUND OF SWIFT FOOD & CO 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  According to U.S. and Brazilian media, Swift began to experience 
increasing debt in late 2003 when the United States first reported 
cases of mad cow disease and Japan temporarily banned imports of 
American beef.  The company incurred further losses when, as part of 
an identity-theft investigation involving immigrants, U.S. 
immigration agents raided the company's plants in 2006 and found a 
large number of undocumented workers.  These raids cost the company 
between USD 45-50 million in lost earnings and expenses to recruit 
and train new workers.  Swift reported net sales of USD 2.09 billion 
for its fiscal third quarter ending this past February 25, down 6.9 
percent from net sales of USD 2.24 billion in the same period the 
previous year.  For the fiscal year ending May 28, 2006, the company 
posted a loss of USD 129.55 million on sales of USD 9.35 billion.

PURCHASE DETAILS 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  JBS-Friboi purchased Swift for USD 225 million with the 
assumption of USD 1.16 billion in debt, bringing the total 
transaction to approximately USD 1.4 billion.  The takeover creates 
the world's largest beef producer in terms of animals slaughtered. 
Together the two companies have the capacity to slaughter 47,100 
cattle a day, surpassing Tyson's capacity of 37,100 and Cargill's of 
36,000.  Swift's pork unit is the most profitable and includes three 
U.S. plants.  As Friboi's strength is beef, the company intends to 
analyze the performance of the pork business and then decide whether 
to spin off or expand pork operations. 
 
----------------------- 
INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION 
----------------------- 
 
¶4.  The purchase reflects JBS-Friboi's consistent expansion 
strategy.  The company began exporting fresh meat in 1997 and first 
expanded internationally in 2005 with the purchase of Argentine meat 
processor Swift Armour.  While this is the largest purchase by 
JBS-Friboi to date, it is also part of a series of acquisitions 
intended to consolidate the company's global presence.  According to 
JBS-Friboi chief executive Joel Mendonca Batista, the purchase is 
crucial for providing new "distribution channels in Japan, Korea, 
and also in the United States."  With this expansion, JBS-Friboi 
gains increased access to the markets of the United States and 
Australia.  Together with Argentina and Brazil, these four countries

represent 50% of world meat consumption and more than 80% of world 
meat exports, making JBS-Friboi the new meat powerhouse in the world 
market.

COMMENT

¶5.  This transaction represents another example of Brazilian 
companies increasing their investments outside Brazil as part of 
their strategy to diversify markets and attempt to become global 
players (reftel).  End Comment.
