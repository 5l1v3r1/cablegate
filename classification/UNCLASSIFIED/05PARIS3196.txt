Denis Brunel's participation in the IV program would help him 
better understand U.S. policies on electricity and gas as well 
as stress to him the importance of Europe's cooperating with 
America on such issues for their mutual advancement. The 
project will sharpen Mr. Brunel's knowledge of American 
perspectives on current and future energy issues, develop a 
range of contacts, and help ensure a balanced view of the U.S. 
in someone of future influence on the politics of energy in 
France and Europe.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: Sylvie Vacheret 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Two factors make Denis Brunel, a hardworking and driven 
professional, an indispensable candidate for an IV program: 
his professional focus on energy issues and his involvement in 
politics. These factors have been part of his life since his 
time as a university student. 
After completing his university studies in Management and in 
Politics, where he specialized in Human Resources Management 
while at the same time holding down a job, he became an expert 
in professional relations at Electricite de France. This 
adeptness later led him to a position at the French 
Association of Electricity and Gas Producers where he now 
holds the title of Secretary General of the Human Resources 
Committee. On top of this, Mr. Brunel is also a General 
Delegate of the French Center for Electricity, a lobbying 
association made up of various electric companies. 
Throughout his life, Denis Brunel has been deeply involved in 
politics. At a young age he joined Chirac's party, the 
Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR), and eventually worked 
his way up to vice-president of the RPR's youth movement; a 
position he held from 1985 till 1993. He later translated this 
experience into a successful run for the city Counselor of 
Valence. Always looking to the future, he next invested his 
energies in the Association PanEurope France, which is the 
French branch of the Union Paneuropeenne Internationale. This 
organization is dedicated to the promotion of European ideals 
and goals through debates and publications, and focuses 
especially in the important and expanding domain of science 
and technology. This is very important to U.S. interests 
because securing the technological frontier is an important 
aspect of the United States' national security. Furthermore, 
it is desirable that an individual who heads up the French 
branch of an organization encouraging European unity also 
comprehend U.S. policy as fully as possible. 
Denis Brunel is now approaching a turning point in his career 
and is exploring advancement opportunities at EDF. His future 
could also be influenced by the fact that he has close ties to 
Nicolas Sarkozy, the new head of the UMP and possible future 
President of France. As someone who has been in, and will 
likely again be included in, political committees to devise 
strategies for French energy issues, he is also in a position 
to be considered for a future cabinet counselor. 
Clearly, it would be advantageous to give a person with 
political leadership experience, technological understanding, 
and ties to the French and European political establishment a 
chance to participate in a program that could further his 
positive views of the U.S. and pass what he learns on to the 
UMP, France, and Europe at large.
