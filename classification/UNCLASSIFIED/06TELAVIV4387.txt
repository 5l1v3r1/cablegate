SUBJECT: ISRAEL MEDIA REACTION 
 
-------------------------------- 
SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT: 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶1. US Israeli Relations 
 
¶2. Lebanon 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------ 
 
Leading media reported that US top envoys Elliot Abrams and David 
Welsh met Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Thursday.  According to the 
media the two envoys demanded that Israel halts its IAF flights over 
Lebanon saying they are undermining the standing of Lebanese Prime 
Minister Fouad Siniora. The media also noted that the meeting with 
Olmert was dedicated to prepare his visit to the US and that they 
did not put forth any new diplomatic initiative on behalf of the 
Bush administration. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that following the destruction two weeks ago of 
structures in the old industrial park during an Israel Defense 
Forces operation in the Gaza Strip, Turkey has postponed a visit by 
a delegation from Ankara that was supposed to sign an agreement on 
developing a joint Israeli-Palestinian industrial park. According to 
the paper, the Americans, who are backing the plan, also expressed 
dissatisfaction with Israel's action through envoys David Welch and 
Elliott Abrams. 
 
Leading media reported that PM Olmert met U.S. Director of National 
Intelligence John Negroponte on Thursday.  Negroponte is visiting 
Israel as the guest of Mossad chief Meir Dagan. The media noted that 
Negroponte's talks with Israeli intelligence officials are focusing 
on Iran and its nuclear program. 
 
All media reported that the IDF operation in Gaza continues. Israel 
Radio reported that on Friday a Palestinian militant was killed in 
Beit Hanun and four Hamas men were killed in an Israeli air strike 
in Gaza City.  Also on Friday, Israel Defense Forces troops fatally 
shot a top Fatah militant in the West Bank who was apparently 
planning to detonate a car bomb. 
 
Israel Radio reported that IDF troops opened fire Friday on a group 
of women who streamed to a north Gaza mosque to serve as human 
shields for gunmen holed up there, killing one and wounding 10. The 
radio reported that the troops have been trading fire with militants 
firing from the mosque.  According to reports part of the roof 
collapsed during the clashes, but it is yet unclear if there were 
causalities in the event. 
Israel Radio reported that IDF have arrested another Palestinian 
Minister Abdel Rahman Zaidan, a Hamas official, in Ramallah on 
Friday. 
 
Ha'aretz quotes security officials as saying that the Egyptians are 
doing almost nothing to prevent weapon smuggling into Gaza. 
According to these sources the frustration is big because Israel has 
forwarded to Egypt the names of the smuggling organizers and lists 
of suspects but they did nothing. 
 
Maariv reported that Minister of Defense Amir Peretz has met with a 
European negotiator and relayed a message, in which he hinted that 
aid in the release of Gilad Shalit could lead to a resumption of 
political negotiations between Israel and Syria.  The paper noted 
that despite the fact that the defense minister continues to open 
the door to Assad, it is not clear whether this has been coordinated 
PM Ehud Olmert. 
 
Yediot reported that following warnings of a strategic terror attack 
on Israel's water supplies, the cabinet is expected to approve the 
establishment of a national water security administration that will 
also prepare for a scenario water resources poisoning. 
 
Leading media reported Iran has test-fired its Zilzal, Shahab 2 and 
Shahab 3 ballistic missiles, which have the capability of reaching 
Israel and Europe. 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted PM Olmert as saying, in a special session 
in the Knesset to mark the 11th anniversary of the assassination of 
prime minister Yithak Rabin, that the world is too slow in standing 
up to Iran. 
 
Leading media reported that generals in the IDF General Staff have 
gathered material regarding the conduct of Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. 
Dan Halutz during the Lebanon war, and they intend to present it to 
the Winograd Committee. 
 
POLL: 
 
A poll conducted by Ha'aretz and Dialog under the guidance of 
Professor Camille Fuchs found: 
Seventy percent are unsatisfied by PM Olmert's job; 20 percent are 
pleased; 10 percent are indecisive. 
Eighty two percent are unsatisfied by Minister of Defense Peret'z 
job; 14 percent are pleased and 4 percent are indecisive.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz: "How do you know that Ehud Olmert is about to 
go to Washington? Very simple: Read the cabinet decisions.  If you 
find promises there to strengthen Palestinian Authority Chairman 
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and 'to make concessions on humanitarian 
grounds' to the population in the Gaza Strip, you can assume there 
is a need to satisfy the Americans."

"Words, Words, Words" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (11/03): "How do you know that Ehud Olmert is 
about to go to Washington? Very simple: Read the cabinet decisions. 
If you find promises there to strengthen Palestinian Authority 
Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and 'to make concessions on 
humanitarian grounds' to the population in the Gaza Strip, you can 
assume there is a need to satisfy the Americans.  The concessions 
were made public -- what a coincidence -- hours before U.S. 
administration emissaries David Walsh and Elliott Abrams arrived to 
prepare Olmert's trip to the United States.... This time the envoys 
arrived with an ambitious plan that was formulated by Lieutenant 
General Keith Dayton, who is coordinating security vis-a-vis the 
Palestinians for the administration.  The United States wants to 
push Abu Mazen into a military confrontation in Gaza, which will 
topple the Hamas government.... There has been less enthusiasm in 
Israel.... But it is hard to refuse the Americans; and the solution 
was to affirm the Dayton plan in principle, without committing to 
its details (which were not even presented to the cabinet 
ministers).  That way Olmert's visit can take place in a calm 
atmosphere and thereafter, the promises will be forgotten, as after 
all visits in the past."

¶2. Lebanon: 
----------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: "The flights over 
Beirut are currently helping Hezbollah rather than hurting it. 
There are enough diplomatic ways for Israel to express its protest. 
The violation of Lebanese sovereignty should not be considered the 
first resort, nor should it be seen as a trivial matter."

"Provocation in Lebanon's Skies" 
 
Independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (11/03): "In recent 
days, Israel Air Force aircraft have repeatedly flown over Beirut to 
signal Israel's dissatisfaction with the diplomatic situation that 
emerged following the war and with the nonimplementation of United 
Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which brought an end to 
the fighting after it was accepted by all sides. The assumption that 
a provocation of this sort over Lebanon's airspace will somehow 
further Israel's interests has been part of Israel's security policy 
for years.... There is nothing like overflights of Beirut, 
especially the kind that terrorize the residents, to help Hezbollah 
justify its continued arming against Israel.... Lebanon is 
experiencing an internal political crisis that could alter the 
character of the state and elevate Hezbollah and its supporters to 
power. It is doubtful that this is the sort of outcome that those 
supporting the war thought about when they decided to respond with 
force to the abduction of two soldiers.... In such a sensitive 
situation, it is doubtful that Israel's provocation over Beirut was 
wise.  The violation of Lebanon's sovereign airspace is in itself a 
violation of the cease-fire agreement, and when its purpose was 
political rather than defense-related, it seems doubtful that it 
reflected a far-sighted diplomatic vision. Nonetheless, it is clear 
that Israel should not accept the continued flow of weapons from 
Syria into Lebanon.  The flights over Beirut are currently helping 
Hezbollah rather than hurting it.  There are enough diplomatic ways 
for Israel to express its protest.  The violation of Lebanese 
sovereignty should not be considered the first resort, nor should it 
be seen as a trivial matter."
