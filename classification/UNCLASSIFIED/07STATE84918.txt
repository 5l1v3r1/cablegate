SUBJECT: SUDAN: Response to Egypt's Proposal on the AU/UN 
Political Process 
 
¶1. Egyptian FM Aboul Gheit sent a verbal message to 
Secretary Rice on May 10 proposing ideas on how to

reinvigorate the Darfur peace process. Please deliver the 
following letter from Secretary Rice. No signed original 
will follow. 
 
¶2. BEGIN TEXT: 
 
Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
Please accept my sincere condolences on the death of UN 
peacekeeper Lieutenant Colonel Ehab Nazih in Darfur. His 
sacrifice and the hard work of all Egyptians contributing 
to the international community's mission will be 
remembered and are greatly appreciated. 
 
Thank you as well for your letter regarding ideas for 
reinvigorating the peace process in Darfur. United States 
thinking closely follows your proposals on the political 
 
process. We welcom your support of the UN/AU-led 
mediation process as agreed on April 29th in Tripoli and 
your assistance in holding the Government of Sudan to the 
commitments it made in Abuja and Addis Ababa. 
 
I look forward to working with you, the UN Security 
Council, and the international community to advance a 
roadmap to bring non-signatory rebel movements into the 
Darfur Peace Agreement. While international involvement 
will be key to monitoring the political process, we are 
concerned that an international conference to endorse a 
roadmap could delay progress and be seen by Sudan as an 
opportunity to try to further stall, and dilute its 
commitments and the AU/UN hybrid force. 
 
We should move forward now with the AU/UN hybrid force in 
parallel with the political process as called for by the 
November 2006 Addis Ababa agreement. I appreciate Egypt's 
offer of troops to the UN Heavy Support package and 
Armored Personnel Carriers to the Light Support Package. 
Given the urgency of the issue and the possibility of 
increased instability in Darfur, I ask that Egypt provide 
the troops and equipment the UN has requested as soon as 
possible, without pre-conditions. Any delay in the 
deployment would contribute to more instability in Darfur. 
 
Again, thank you for your efforts to resolve this crisis 
and achieve peace in Darfur. 
 
Sincerely, 
Condoleezza Rice
