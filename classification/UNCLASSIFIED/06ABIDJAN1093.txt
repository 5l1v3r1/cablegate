SUBJECT: COTE D'IVOIRE'S PALM OIL SECTOR 
 
 
¶1.  Summary.  Cote d'Ivoire's palm oil production has 
increased steadily in recent years, and its exports have 
nearly doubled.  However, it still accounts for only one 
percent of world production and half of one percent of world 
exports.  Palm oil also directly accounted for less than 1 
percent of GDP in 2005 but much of the oil is processed into 
secondary products for the domestic or export markets. 
Producers here are concerned about the long-term future of 
their sector due to higher costs and lower yields than the 
big Southeast Asian producers, but Cote d'Ivoire's production 
is nevertheless expected to increase significantly in coming 
years.  Although Cote d'Ivoire may never become a major palm 
oil producer, it is at least holding on to its niche in West 
Africa.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  Table 1 shows Cote d'Ivoire's palm oil production. 
Except for a dip in 2002/2003, which industry sources tell us 
was the result of both bad weather and political instability 
after the September 2002 rebellion, production has increased 
steadily in recent years.  Production increased by a total of 
31 percent from 2001/2002 to 2004/2005, and is projected to 
increase by another 6 percent in 2005/2006.  Cote d'Ivoire's 
share of world production has remained steady at about 1.0 
percent.

¶3.  Table 2 shows Cote d'Ivoire's palm oil exports, which 
increased by 87 percent from 2002 to 2005.  The country's 
share of world exports went up slightly to half of one 
percent over this period.  Almost all of the exports go to 
nearby West African countries.  The biggest export increases 
have been to Senegal, Ghana and Mali.

¶5.  Ivoirian palm oil plantations consist of a central 
plantation and mill.  These mills also process fruit sold by 
nearby smallholders/sharecroppers and village cooperatives. 
The plantation companies furnish the smallholders with 
seedlings, fertilizers, pesticides and technical assistance. 
The oil processed by the mills is sold for export or for 
further processing into secondary industrial products for the 
domestic and export markets.  In addition, subsistence 
farmers harvest fruit from wild palm oil groves and extract 
the oil by traditional methods for local consumption. 
According to the Ministry of Finance, oil plantations employ 
32,300 workers while another 13,400 are employed in 
processing facilities. 
 
¶6.  Privatization of the palm oil industry took place in 1997 
when parastatal PALMINDUSTRIE was broken up and sold to three 
large, mostly private enterprises:  PALM-CI, SIPEF-CI and 
PALMAFRIQUE.  PALM-CI is the largest palm oil company in Cote 
d,Ivoire.  It accounts for 2/3 of total production capacity 
and operates ten processing plants and 36,000 hectares of 
industrial plantations.  PALM-CI processes over 70% of the 
total palm oil in Cote d,Ivoire, and employs 20,000 farmers 
and nearly 7000 salaried employees.  Smallholder plantations 
working with PALM-CI alone account for nearly 50% of palm oil 
plantation area in Cote d,Ivoire with approximately 110,000 
hectares.  Major PALM-CI shareholders include Unilever , 
SIFCA and the Government of Cote d,Ivoire.  According to 
PALM-CI, palm oil production in 2004 totaled 199,000 MT, up

22 percent from 2003.  SIPEFCI operates two processing plants 
and 12,700 hectares of industrial plantations, while 
PALMAFRIQUE operates three processing plants and 7,500 
hectares of plantations.  PALMAFRIQUE and SIPEF-CI each 
increased palm oil production by 13-14 percent between 2003 
and 2004. 
 
¶7.  Producers here are concerned about the medium- to 
long-term future.  While they have managed to hold on to 
their regional markets, these companies are finding it 
difficult to compete against the large Asian producers.  Even 
in Cote d'Ivoire's domestic markets, imported secondary palm 
oil products such as cooking oil from Southeast Asia are 
crowding out their own.  The Ivoirians tell us that 
electricity costs are more than twice as in Malaysia, while 
the average yield per hectare here is less than half of what 
it is in Indonesia and Malaysia.  Producers here also 
complain about high Euro-pegged costs and lack of government 
interest in supporting the industry as compared with other 
agricultural products such as cocoa and coffee.   However, 
despite the complaints, Cote d'Ivoire's largest producers are 
reinvesting in the sector and palm oil production should 
continue to rise over the next few years.
