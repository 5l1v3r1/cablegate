¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Russian Federal Nuclear Center (VNIITF), 
Institute of Technical Physics, Snezhinsk, Russia. The 
company was listed on BIS license number:  D279875 as 
the ultimate consignee of 1 optima 2000DV inductively 
coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer system 
and accessories, ECCN: 4A994. These items are 
controlled for anti-terrorism reasons. The licensee is 
Perkin-Elmer, Inc, 761 Main Ave., Mail Stop 52, 
Norwalk, CT 06859. Reftel 2 is an unfavorable 
recommendation citing the refusal of the GOR to grant 
access to the facility in order for ECO Moscow to 
conduct the end use check. 
 
¶3. NOTE: The Russian Federal Nuclear Center (VNIITF), 
Institute of Technical Physics, Snezhinsk conducts 
research on nuclear fuel cycle technologies and 
fissile material processing.  The Government of Russia 
(GOR) Ministry of Atomic Energy (Russian acronym 
MINATOM) still classifies VNIITF as a "closed 
facility."  Foreigners are generally not granted 
access to closed facilities, however, a bilateral 
agreement between the US Department of Energy (DOE) 
and MINATOM allows for site visits by DOE personnel 
for information exchange and audit purposes. DOE and 
VNIITF have been working on collaborative projects 
since 1992.  END NOTE. 
 
¶4. On June 14, 2007 ECO Pearce participated in a DOE 
teleconference with Maegon E. Barlow, Deputy Office 
Director - Office of Weapons Material Protection, 
National Nuclear Security Administration. Ms. Barlow 
and her team were scheduled to visit the VNIITF 
facilities as part of a DOE Threat Reduction and 
Safeguards project assessment. ECO Pearce gave Ms. 
Barlow a briefing on conducting BIS end use checks, 
and the specific commodities to be verified, including 
descriptions of the devices and the locations of 
number plates.  Ms. Barlow stated that she would be 
conducting the check on June 29, 2007. 
 
¶5. On July 3, 2007 ECO Pearce received the following 
email from Ms. Barlow. 
 
Subject:  Post Shipment Verification of the Perkin 
Elmer Optima 2000DV Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical 
Emissions Spectrometer at VNIITF. Summary:  Maegon 
Barlow conducted a post-shipment verification of the 
ICP Spectrometer Optima 2000DV provided to VNIITF 
under export control license #D279875 per the request 
of the US Department of Commerce on June 29th, 2007. 
The spectrometer was brought to the International 
Business Center (ICB) in Snezhinsk where Ms. Barlow 
was able to see the spectrometer.  Ms. Barlow 
confirmed that it was in fact a Perkin Elmer Optima 
2000DV Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emissions 
Spectrometer - serial number # 080N1061301.  Ms. 
Barlow inquired about the operability and purpose of 
the spectrometer.  The VNIITF personnel that operate 
the Spectrometer reported this it was fully 
operational and informed Ms. Barlow that the primary 
purpose of the equipment was to assist with the 
scientific research on alternate power generation (ie 
looking at fuel cells).  The spectrometer is also 
being used by geologists to conduct pollution analysis 
(i.e looking at rain water, industrial pollutants). 
Ms. Barlow was informed that the spectrometer was not 
being used for any nuclear related activities. 
The VNIITF personnel responsible for the equipment 
were forthcoming with information and access to the 
equipment.  Ms. Barlow was able to get pictures of the 
spectrometer.  The post-shipment verification was 
recorded in the signed Protocol of Meeting.  End 
quote. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends Bochvar All- 
Russian Scientific Research Institute For Inorganic 
Materials (VNIINM) as a reliable recipient of 
 
 
 
 
 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
