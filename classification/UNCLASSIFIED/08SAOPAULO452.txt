SUBJECT: REINTERPRETING THE VALUE OF DOHA'S FAILURE 
 
Commentary by Andre Meloni Nassar, general director of the Institute 
of Studies of International Trade and Negotiations in center-right O 
Estado de S. Paulo (08/22) says:  "...The Brazilian government made 
mistakes during the Doha Round process.  None of them, however, 
means anything for the final moments of the negotiation. Supporting 
Argentina would have meant to deny the importance of the agreements 
for Brazilian agriculture.  Supporting China and India, under the 
excuse of putting pressure on the Americans, would have obliged us 
to accept highly protectionist agricultural safeguards.  We are not 
in a comfortable situation without the round.  Maybe we would be in 
a comfortable situation if we had invested more on bilateral 
agreements."
