SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: GLOBAL ECONOMY 
 
Latin America and the Crisis: an anti-cyclical and progressive 
answer 
 
Op-Ed in business-oriented Valor Econtmico (1-26) by Marcelo M. 
Giugale, World Bank Director of Economic Policy and Poverty 
Reduction for Latin America and the Caribbean: "Latin American 
governments need to amortize the impact of the global financial 
crisis. They do not have many tools to do this. But they do have one 
that is particularly powerful, as it encourages both economic growth 
and social fairness: the transformation of subsidies for all into 
subsidies for all the poor....Latin America spends annually between 
5% and 10% of its GDP on subsidies....This crisis is an opportunity 
[to direct the subsidies to the homes that need it most]."
