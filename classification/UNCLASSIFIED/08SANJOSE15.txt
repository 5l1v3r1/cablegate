1, On Monday, January 7, Ambassador Langdale and Deputy Chief 
of Mission Brennan met with the GOCR FM Bruno Stagno.  Though 
the premise of the meeting was the Ambassador's farewell 
call, the Ambassador delivered the SECSTATE invitation letter 
for the March WIREC Conference to the Minister, as directed 
in Reftel. 
 
¶2. FM Stagno appreciated the invitation. We expect his 
response will track closely with the MFA's list of 
participants, passed to us last October and reported to the 
Department (Reftel B).
