¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), attempted 
to conduct a post shipment verification (PSV) at JSD Broad 
Electronic (HK) Co. Ltd., Lot 89, Ping Ha Road, Fau Shan, Yuen Long, 
New Territories, Hong Kong (JSD Broad (HK)). The item in question is 
a 20T4G18A microwave amplifier exported to JSD Broad (HK) on or 
about December 24, 2007 and valued at approximately USD 42,000.  The 
item is classified under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 
3A001 and is controlled for national security (NS) reasons.  Telecom 
Associates of Saratoga, California was the exporter. 
 
¶3.  A review of the Hong Kong Companies Registry reveals that JSD 
Broad (HK) has been in existence since May 2006.  Its paid-up share 
capital is the Hong Kong equivalent of USD 1250. Its sole director 
and shareholder is Chinese mainland national, Xie, Jin.  The 
Registry lists Xie, Jin's mainland identification card number as 
510102196610187526 (with resulting birth date of October 18, 1966). 
Xie, Jin is not a director in any other company listed in the Hong 
Kong Companies Registry.  The company's registered address is Room 
1007, 10/F Ho King Ctr. No 2-16 Fa Yuen St, Mongkok, Hong Kong. 
 
¶4.  This same registered address is the registered address of a 
corporate secretarial services company named HKRTP Limited.  That 
secretarial services company has offices in Hong Kong and in a range 
of cities in mainland China. When Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan 
called HKRTP, the company claimed that it had no record of JSD Broad 
(HK). 
 
¶5.  The registered address of HKRTP and JSD Broad (HK) is also the 
registered address of Mingxin Technology, a company that was the 
subject of a previous unfavorable PLC referenced in reftel B as well 
as a pending PSV referenced in reftel C. The PLC in reftel B 
involved pumps controlled for chemical and biological weapons 
reasons.  As described further in reftel B, this address is located 
in an older office building.  At the time the ECO visited this 
location, it was vacant. 
 
¶6.  Internet based background research reveals that JSD Broad (HK) 
is listed as the Asia sales representative of a company called GCP 
Microwave Technology Co. Ltd. (www.gcpmicrowave.com).  A further 
review of the www.gcpmicrowave.com web site reveals that the company 
apparently has additional sales offices in Beijing (JSD Technology 
Co. Ltd.), Shanghai (JSD Technology Co. Ltd.), Canada (Amery 
Technology Ltd.) and the United States (JC Pacific Techology (sic.) 
Ltd.). Further internet research reveals that a JSD Technology Co. 
Ltd. is registered in Beijing as well. An additional company in 
Shanghai (Shanghai YQF Trading Co., Ltd.) is listed on Alibaba as 
selling microwave components, waveguide and other products.  Its 
contact details are the same as those of JSD Technology in Shanghai 
(www.alibaba.com/member/siahairen/contactinfo .html) 
 
¶7.  An internet domain search reveals that the domain 
gcpmicrowave.com is registered by a Sunny Zhang of JSD Technology 
Ltd. Co., Room 207, The 4 West Building No. 83, Fuxing Rd, HaiDian 
District, Beijing.  The registrant phone number is listed as +86 
01051606950 and the registrant e-mail is listed as 
jesda@vip.sina.com. 
 
¶8.  FCS Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan attempted, on several 
occasions, to schedule the PSV.  Often, the phone rang without 
answer.  Eventually, a person answered the phone but declared that 
she knew nothing of JSD Broad (HK). She declined to give her name as 
well as the name of her company although she did confirm that the 
phone number provided in reftel A is located at the ship-to address 
for the shipment that is the subject of this PSV. 
 
¶9.  On September 5, 2008, ECO, ICE representative Stan Seto and 
Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan attempted to visit the address 
listed in reftel A. The address does not exist. A review of Shippers 
Export Declarations (SEDs) reveals that other shipments (from Radar 
Systems Technology in Mountain View California) have gone to 
companies named JSD Broad and JSD Broadband at another address in 
Hong Kong(ITN 20080108000269, ITN 20080225032474 and ITN 
20080507019674), namely Flat B, 38/F, Tower 1, Banyan Garden, 863 
Lai Chi Kok Rd., Kowloon, Hong Kong.  This address is in a 
residential neighborhood.  With shipping documents for these 
additional shipments, ECO may attempt to schedule an EUC at the 
Banyan Garden address. 
 
¶10.  ECO requested Hong Kong government assistance in finding and 
making contact with the company but, to date, Hong Kong Customs has 
been unable to do so.  ECO will provide updated information when he 
 
 
receives it. 
 
¶11.  In light of the facts noted above, ECO does not believe the JSD 
Broad is a suitable recipient of U.S. origin technology.
