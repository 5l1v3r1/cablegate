SUBJECT: ARIAS INVITATION TO POTUS FOR NOVEMBER 19 UNSC DEBATE 
 
¶1. On September 8, 2008, we received a diplomatic note from the MFA 
transmitting a letter from President Arias to POTUS, which invites 
POTUS to participate in the GOCR-hosted UNSC thematic debate during 
Costa Rica's November Security Council presidency.  The debate will 
analyze the theme of strengthening multilateral collective security 
arrangements - both regional and global - under Chapter 8 of the UN 
Charter. POTUS is invited to participate in the debate on November 
¶19. An unofficial translation of Arias' letter is below. 
 
¶2. A scanned copy of the Arias letter was transmitted by email to 
WHA/CEN and to IO/UNP on September 9. The original will be sent to 
WHA/CEN in our next outgoing pouch, on September 11. 
 
¶3. BEGIN TEXT of invitation: 
 
Oscar Arias-Sanchez 
The President of the Republic 
San Jose, Costa Rica 
27 August 2008 
 
His Excellency Mr. George W. Bush 
President 
United States of America 
 
Excellency, 
 
Costa Rica will have the honor of assuming the presidency of the 
United Nations Security Council for the upcoming month of November. 
On this occasion, we will convoke a debate in which all the Member 
States of the Organization may analyze the topic of strengthening 
multilateral collective security mechanisms, regional and global, as 
an incentive for disarmament, and for the reduction of military 
spending that countries incur to meet their national security 
needs. 
 
The Security Council is the most important of multilateral 
mechanisms, acting on behalf of all the Member States and in 
collaboration with regional organisms, safeguarding international 
peacekeeping and security.  The viability of the concept of 
collective security, on which the UN system was built, rests largely 
on the effectiveness of this body. 
 
My country wants to promote a creative and frank dialogue on the 
need to strengthen the mechanisms of collective security that the 
international community counts on.  From our perspective, this would 
allow the allocation of a larger amount of resources for 
consolidating sustainable peace and promoting development. 
 
The main challenge that humanity should overcome today is to free 
many human beings from poverty.  Promoting development in all its 
aspects, plus environmental and energy challenges, demands greater 
efforts.  In this sense, the exponential increase in military 
spending should be a reason for concern because it competes directly 
with the need for investment in human development. 
 
Excellency, our countries share principles and aspirations.  For 
this reason, I would like to personally invite you to accompany us 
in this debate that will take place on November 19.  I know that 
your vision and leadership will enrich our discussion to further the 
cause of a more peaceful and unified world. 
 
In hopes that we can count on your valuable presence in this event, 
I reiterate the assurances of my highest esteem and consideration.
