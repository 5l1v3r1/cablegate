REF: REFS: (A) STATE 111637 (B) STATE 111657 
 
¶1.  ADCM and PolIntern met on July 20 with MFA 
under-secretary for Multilateral Affairs Miguel Mendez and 
Human Rights officer Maria Elena Moreira to convey points in 
reftels.  Mendez indicated the GOE was generally supportive 
of the USG agenda for UN reform and the September High-Level 
Event, but said that official decisions had not yet been 
taken.  President Palacio and Foreign Minister Parra will 
attend the HLE; it had not yet been determined which of them 
deliver the speech to the General Assembly.  Mendez said that 
he expected the speech's focus to be on the importance of 
education and economic development through investment in 
technology. 
 
DEVELOPMENT AND DEMOCRACY 
------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Mendez expressed support for USG's development focus and 
the Monterrey Consensus and said this is the GOE's main 
priority for UN reform as well.  Mendez said he expected the 
GOE would support the proposed Democracy Fund. 
 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
------------ 
 
¶3.  In July 7 meeting with Moreira, PolIntern conveyed USG 
support for creation of a Human Rights Council.  Moreira said 
the GOE would likely approve of this idea, and generally 
agreed with USG positions on issues of peer review and 
structure.  However, GOE would like clarification of 
requirements for membership on the proposed committee to 
ensure objectivity.  For his part, Mendez also expressed 
strong approval for the creation of the Human Rights Council, 
citing the GOE's priority on effective human rights. 
 
UN MANAGEMENT REFORM 
-------------------- 
 
¶4.  MFA officials expressed general agreement with USG 
recommendations of budgetary, management, and administrative 
reform of the UN.  Mendez said GOE shares USG interest in a 
more efficient and transparent UN; he believes GOE will 
likely support the creation of an Office of Internal 
Oversight Services. 
 
PEACEBUILDING 
------------- 
 
¶5.  Mendez expressed interest in the USG proposal for 
creation of a Peacebuilding Commission, saying the GOE would 
review it carefully before taking a decision.  He agreed on 
the importance of peacebuilding efforts, saying the GOE 
opposes violence of any sort.  Without committing GOE support 
for the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, 
he said the GOE shares the USG goal of increasing 
international security. 
 
ECOSOC AND UNGA 
--------------- 
 
¶6.  Mendez agreed with the USG position on UNGA reform, 
particularly on reform of ECOSOC.  The GOE supports the 
modernization and refocusing of UN institutions for increased 
effectiveness and transparency, and agrees that political 
conflicts over membership need to be minimized.
