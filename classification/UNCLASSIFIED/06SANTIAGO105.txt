On January 14, conservative, influential newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (circ. 116,807) carried an editorial entitled, "Chavez' 
Activism."  Quote: 
 
"What has happened (with Mexico, Peru and Chile) prove right those 
who saw in Hugo Chavez a successor to Fidel Castro and predicted an 
intent to reconstitute something akin to the late Latin American 
Organization for Solidarity (OLAS), promoted by the Cuban dictator 
in the 70s with other Latin American leftist leaders and led by 
former President Salvador Allende.  The antibodies Chavez generates 
and the reality of globalization will make it hard to reach his goal 
of Latin American leadership."
