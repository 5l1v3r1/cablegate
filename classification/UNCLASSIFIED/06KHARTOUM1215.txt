SUBJECT: SUDAN: UPDATE ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION, 
CONSTITUTIONAL REVIEW COMMISSION, AND CHILD LAWS 
 
National Human Rights Commission 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Draft legislation for the CPA mandated National 
Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is, according to the European 
Commission, in the Presidency and should be forwarded to the 
Parliament soon. There have been multiple versions of the 
draft legislation and it is unclear which version was 
forwarded to the Presidency. The UN was unable to verify the 
status of the Commission's draft legislation.  Under the 
proposed law, the Presidency approves the Commission's final 
budget. Critics charge that this compromises the 
independence of the Commission and want the National 
Assembly to approve the budget.  A UN representative said 
that it was peculiar for the Presidency to approve the 
Commission's budget as it does not approve any other 
Commission's budget. Additionally, the SPLM has demanded 
that the NHRC investigate past crimes. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a May 21 donor country meeting, the European 
Commission representative stressed that the National 
Constitutional Review Commission (NCRC) did not draft the 
legislation as mandated by the CPA.  The UN representative 
expressed concern over the selection process for members of 
the Commission, highlighting that the selection must follow 
Human Rights Law.  The donors agreed to a joint meeting with 
the Advisory Council for Human Rights (ACHR) and the Chair 
of the NCRC to discuss concerns regarding the independence 
of the Commission and the process of drafting the NHRC 
legislation. The donors said they would provide financial 
assistance to the Commission if it is established according 
to the Paris Principles. 
 
National Constitutional Review Commission 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) On April 30, the Presidency announced the 60 
members of the NCRC, however, it does not have a budget, 
office space or a secretariat. Observers note that the GNU 
is attempting to weaken the mandate of the NCRC and its 
ability to operate as illustrated by the GNU bypassing the 
Commission in drafting legislation for the CPA mandated 
Commissions. 
 
Child Rights Law 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) UNICEF is currently working with the GNU to reform 
child laws in accordance with UN Principles of Child Rights. 
The GNU National Council for Child Welfare (NCCW) created a 
committee to propose amendments to current child laws. The 
Committee is composed of lawyers from the military, the 
ACHR, UNICEF and the Ministries of Interior, Judiciary, 
Labor, Social Welfare. UNICEF is also pushing for Child 
Protection Units within the Police.
