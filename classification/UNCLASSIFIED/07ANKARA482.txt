REF: ANKARA 354 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  As of February 28, the H5N1 strain of avian influenza has been 
detected in 12 locations of four districts in Batman province, 
including one area with wild birds, and in six locations of two 
districts in Diyarbakir province.  There have been a total of 283 
dead birds with confirmed cases of H5N1, 179 in Batman and 104 in 
Diyarbakir, between February 9 and 28. 
 
¶2. In Batman, the first district with 80 confirmed cases of H5N1 on 
February 9 has not yet had another case.  The second district has 
had confirmation of new cases about 6-7 days apart (two cases on 
February 14, then ten on February 21, 49 cases on the 22nd, and then 
ten cases on the 28th).  The third district also had four new cases 
in a new village, about six days after its first seven cases in 
another village.  There are about 20 days between when H5N1 was 
confirmed in the first district and in the fourth district of 
Batman. (There were 20 confirmed new cases in the fourth district.) 
In most locations of Batman, all affected birds were chickens; in 
two villages, turkeys were confirmed as having contracted the 
virus. 
 
¶3. Diyarbakir had 20 confirmed cases in its first district on 
February 14.  Two other villages in that same district had a total 
of 66 confirmed cases about 7 days later.  There were 18 confirmed 
cases in a second district of Diyarbakir, also about 7 days after 
the first district had its first cases.  In most locations of 
Diyarbakir, all affected birds were chickens.  In one village, geese 
and roosters were struck by the virus. 
 
¶4. Almost 20,000 poultry have been culled in the two provinces of 
Batman and Diyarbakir: 17,170 in Batman and 2,476 in Diyarbakir. 
Extensive surveillance throughout the country continues and there 
have been no other cases outside of those two provinces. 
 
¶5. Last week, three Turkish veterinarians sponsored by USDA returned 
from the Ames, Iowa HPAI diagnostic training course with very 
positive comments about the program.  One of the participants, along 
with another veterinarian from Ankara, will also attend the OIE 
vaccination course in Italy at the end of March.  FAS and APHIS are 
working on other projects to train Turkish veterinarians in 
AI-related lab techniques. As of February 27, almost 20,000 poultry 
had been culled in the two provinces of Batman and Diyarbakir 
17,170 in Batman and 2,403 in Diyarbakir.  The H5N1 strain of avian 
influenza has been detected in 11 locations of four districts in 
Batman province and in six locations of two districts in Diyarbakir 
province. Extensive surveillance throughout the country continues 
and there have been no other cases outside of those two provinces. 
 
¶6. More than 30 officials from Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Iran, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey Turkmenistan 
and Uzbekistan are currently attending an FAO-organized six-day 
conference on AI Surveillance at Ankara  Eklik Laboratory.  Topics 
include principles of surveillance, on-going activities in 
participating countries, and surveillance for Avian Influenza in 
both domestic poultry and wildlife, and outbreak investigation 
methodology.  The organizers stated aim is to develop a common 
methodology that can be adopted in each participating country.
