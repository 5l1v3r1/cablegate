SUBJECT: JAPAN/IAEA: STATEMENT ON IRAN TO FOCUS ON 
ENCOURAGEMENT OVER PENALTIES 
 
REF: STATE 92883 
 
Per reftel instruction, ESToff on June 9, 2006 delivered to 
MOFA Non-Proliferation, Science and Nuclear Energy Division 
Deputy Director Kenji Enoshita the USG's expectations with 
regard to the Iran agenda item at the upcoming International 
Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors' meeting.  Enoshita 
currently is drafting Japan's BOG statement on Iran and said 
there are no areas of disagreement between the US position 
and Japan's.  The Japanese statement will focus more on 
encouraging Iran to rejoin multilateral talks rather than on 
defining potential penalties should Iran decline to do so, 
according to Enoshita.  The Japanese statement, while 
focusing on encouragement, will also make note of Iran's 
history of non-compliance.
