¶1. DCM shared on 10/31/07 reftel points on the Financial 
Action Task Force's (FATF) statements on Iran with Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs Political Director Rafael Dezcallar. 
Embassy is also sharing reftel points with Ministry of 
Economy Secretary of State David Vegara's office. 
 
¶2. Comment: Our sense is that as an FATF leader, Spain will 
do the right thing in terms of following up on FATF guidance, 
but we will check with the technical staff at Spain's 
Financial Intelligence Unit, SEPLAC.
