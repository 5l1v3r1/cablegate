SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: AMCIT PROPERTY CLAIMS MONTHLY UPDATE: JULY 2009 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. In July 2009, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) reported the 
resolution of five Embassy registered property claims.  These five 
claims were counted during the 2008-2009 Section 527 waiver period. 
To date, the overwhelming majority of resolutions have involved 
compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de 
pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs).  As of July 31, 2009, the GON had 
issued BPIs with a face value of $359,620,184 to Embassy-registered 
claimants.  Since taking office in January 2007, the Ortega 
administration has resolved 95 claims, forty-eight of which during 
the 2008-2009 waiver year. During the first three days of the 
2009-2010 waiver year, July 29-July 31, no claims have been reported 
as resolved.

¶2. On July 13, 2009, the Attorney General's Office provided the 
Embassy a copy of the final settlement document or "finiquito" 
signed by U.S. citizen Domingo Calero on the same day.  Mr. Calero 
received BPIs worth 17,628,100 cordobas, approximately $862,756.  We 
have updated our database to reflect this settlement.
