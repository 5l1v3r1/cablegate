Â¶1. (U)  On July 14, poloff delivered reftel message to Savvas 
 
Vladimirou in the MFA's Divison of the Americas and Oceania. 
Valdimirou said that the EU (through the EU Committee on 
Latin America, COLAT) had developed a document similar to the 
report of the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba and 
that the EU also supported democratic change in Cuba.  He 
believed, based on conversations with Cuban diplomats in 
Brussels, that members of the Cuban govQent below Castro 
were sensitive to the country's need for change and that 
given proper time, peaceful, democratic change after Fidel 
Castro's death was unavoidable.
