SUBJECT: PRM 2006 AMBASSADORS' FUND PROPOSAL FOR 
PALESTINIAN REFUGEES IN GAZA CAMP 
 
REF: STATE 041367 
 
¶1.    (U) Summary. Post requests that PRM consider funding a 
Gaza Strip refugee camp project under the Ambassadors' Fund 
for Refugees program (reftel).  The proposal requests USD 
21,740 to support a project by the Palestinian NGO, Palestine 
Save the Children Foundation, to educate Palestinian women 
residing in the al-Maghazi refugee camp (population, 22,000 
refugees) on sewing skills and management training for 
small-scale enterprises.  End summary. 
 
Proposed Grant Recipient: Income Generation 
Project For Sewing Factory in Gaza's Maghazi Camp 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2.    (U) Palestine Save the Children Foundation (PSCF), a 
Palestinian NGO established in 1999 to promote development 
among refugees and other disadvantaged communities in Gaza, 
is proposing a non-formal education and income generating 
project for women residing in the al-Maghazi refugee camp. 
The project, which would be conducted in coordination with 
the al-Maghazi Community Rehabilitation Society, would 
involve the establishment of a sewing factory for women that 
would include the necessary equipment, tools, and accessories 
to be used for future production activities.  Prior to 
launching the factory, approximately 120 women would be 
provided training courses in advanced sewing skills and 
management of small-scale enterprises.  Modest wages for the 
instructor would be provided in the budget.  The PSCF 
believes that the project would increase the number of women 
wage-earners to provide support for needy Palestinian 
families facing immediate financial problems.  The project 
would also include awareness workshops to instruct the women 
on gender and women rights issues. 
 
¶3.    (U) The project would include the formation of a local 
management committee to oversee project implementation, 
followed by the hiring of a sewing instructor and purchasing 
of the necessary equipment.  Training in sewing skills and 
management of small-scale enterprises would last 
approximately 10 weeks, and would include two weeks of 
awareness workshops on women issues.  The remainder of the 
project would focus on developing the women into marketable 
seamstresses, and using their finished products as income to 
continue operations beyond the completion of the one-year 
project. 
 
The Budget: USD 21,740 
---------------------- 
 
¶4.    (U) The budget breaks down as follows: 
 
-- Purchase of equipment including electrical sewing machines 
(10), chairs (10), sewing accessories, rental and electricity 
fees: USD 13,540. 
 
-- Fees associated with sewing instructor, project 
coordinator, sewing training courses, and awareness 
workshops: USD 8,200. 
 
-- Total: USD 21,740. 
 
Monitoring and Oversight 
------------------------ 
 
¶5.    (U) Due to USG restrictions on travel to Gaza by 
American staff, ConGen oversight of the al-Maghazi Camp 
project would be conducted by a local employee of the PD 
section who resides in Gaza.  Post has the authority and 
procedures in place to transfer funds to the intended 
recipient.
