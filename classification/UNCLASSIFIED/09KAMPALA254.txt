FLIGHT CRASH KILLS ELEVEN 
 
¶1.  Summary: A U.S.-contracted Ilyushin-76 (IL-76) transport 
plane bound for the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) 
crashed into Lake Victoria just after take-off at 
approximately 0515 March 9.  The plane was carrying cargo and 
passengers en route Mogadishu.  All eleven passengers were 
killed, including the deputy AMISOM contingent commander, 
Brigadier General Saloum Nkikumana.  The Defense Attache and 
emboffs went to the scene to provide assistance.  Post 
expects a formal request for U.S. investigation and recovery 
assistance from the Ugandan Government.  We will watch 
closely for the potential impact this latest tragedy has on 
Uganda's continued commitment to the AMISOM operation.  End 
Summary.

¶2.  The U.S.-contacted IL-76 aircraft took off from Entebbe 
International Airport at 0512.  At 0513, a small flash in the 
air was reported by Anthony Allen, the air manager at the 
airbase and two fishermen on the lake at the time.  DynCorp, 
the U.S. contractor, provides logistics assistance for the 
AMISOM operation from its base at Entebbe.  A large explosion 
lit up the sky and scattered debris, according to the eye 
witnesses.  The aircraft went down five nautical miles 
south/southeast from Entebbe.  Rescue boats arrived between 
0530 and 0535 and picked up the two fishermen, who had been 
thrown from their boat due to falling debris.  Ugandan 
authorities questioned them.  They report that the aircraft 
never gained any lift.  Boats, helicopters, and light 
aircraft are being used to view the crash site.  Most of the 
aircraft and debris sunk in about 24-26 meters of water and 
another 10 meters of silt.  Some floating debris was 
recovered.  Press reports that bodies have been recovered are 
false. 
 
¶3.  Ugandan authorities report that none of the eleven 
passengers survived.  There were four Russians (aircrew), two 
Ugandans (one air crew member and a Ugandan major), one South 
African de-miner working for AMISOM, one Indian national 
(DynCorp) accountant), and three Burundians.  Brigadier 
General Saloum Ndikumana, Burundi's Deputy Contingent 
Commander, Colonel Nayubu from AMISOM's operations staff, and 
Captain Pamphile Nkurunziza from the Burundian National 
Defense Forces were among the dead.

¶4.  DATT and two emboffs were on site providing assistance to 
DynCorp and Ugandan authorities, who set up an Operations 
Center at the airport.  Post contacted Dennis Jones, a 
National Transportation Safety Board officer, who is in 
Nairobi for a Safe Skies for Africa Conference.  Jones has 
been working with Ugandan Civil Aviation Authorities and 
emboffs to ensure proper notifications have been made 
according to International Civil Aviation Organizations 
(ICAO) regulations. 
 
¶5.  Uganda's Minister for Transport and Works, John Nasasira, 
visited the crash site at mid-day.  He told Emboff that 
Uganda may need U.S. investigation and recovery assistance. 
We expect two formal requests for assistance from the Ugandan 
Government.  The Ugandan Peoples Defense Forces (UPDF) may 
request mil-mil assistance in the form of divers and sonar. 
Once we receive the UPDF's specific request, we will pass it 
to AFRICOM.  We will continue to monitor the situation and be 
helpful to the Ugandan authorities and DynCorp.

¶6.  The crash has dealt the AMISOM operation another blow. 
We will be watching to see what impact, beyond the immediate 
logistics problems, it will have on Ugandan and Burundian 
resolve to stay the course.
