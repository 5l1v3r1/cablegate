SUGAR TARIFF RATE QUOTA 
 
REF: STATE 106302 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  Ecuador intends to use the entire amount of its sugar 
tariff rate quota (TRQ) for fiscal year (FY) 2010, and is able to 
supply additional sugar if needed.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
¶2.  On September 25, 2009, the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) announced the FY 2010 TRQ for sugar (reftel).  Posts were 
asked to inform appropriate government officials within their 
respective countries of the allocations and to inquire: 1) if the 
host country planned to use its entire sugar TRQ allocation; and 2) 
whether the host country could supply any additional raw sugar by 
September 30, 2010 in case of a TRQ reallocation. 
 
 
 
¶3.  In response to the questions noted in paragraph 2, Ecuador 
plans to use the full amount of its sugar TRQ for FY 2010, and is 
able to provide the United States with more sugar in the event of a 
TRQ reallocation. 
 
 
 
¶4.  Ecuador was allocated 11,583 metric tons raw value (MTRV) for 
its FY 2010 sugar TRQ.  The shipments are planned to take place 
between May and August 2010.
