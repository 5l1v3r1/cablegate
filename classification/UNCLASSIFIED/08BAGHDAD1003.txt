PRESIDENT'S VISIT 
 
This is an Erbil Regional Reconstruction Team message. 
 
¶1.  (U) Vice President Cheney's March 17-18 visit to Baghdad 
and the Kurdistan Region dominated local news broadcasts and 
has received universally positive editorial commentary in 
Kurdish papers in addition to factual reporting.  Local press 
underscored the "historic nature" of the visit as the Vice 
President is the highest ranking USG official to visit the 
region.  Several papers reported that the Vice President 
sought the support of Kurdish leadership for national 
reconciliation and for specific legislation, including the 
hydrocarbons law.  Local press also highlighted the Vice 
President's comments about the Kurdish parties' positive role 
in national politics and his invitation to Regional President 
Barzani to visit Washington. 
 
¶2.  (U)  A commentary in KDP organ, "Khabat," stressed the 
warmth of the relationship and drew attention to the presence 
of the Vice President's wife, Lynne Cheney, in the delegation 
was taken as a sign of that personal warmth.  Local papers 
also remarked on the rare presence of the KRG Prime 
Minister's wife, Nabila Barzani, at official functions. 
 
¶3.  (U)  An editorial in the PUK organ, "Kurdistane Nwe," 
attributed the visit to soaring oil prices and noted the 
significance of the timing so soon after President Talabani's 
visit to Turkey.  The fact that Cheney mentioned the 
"US-Kurdistan Region alliance" and "mentioned the role of the 
Kurds in Baghdad and the significant role of the Kurdish 
leadership in liberating Iraq" was "an important message that 
Washington wanted to convey to the relevant parties." 
 
¶4.  (U)  An opinion piece in the PUK affiliated "Chawder" 
newspaper stated that the Vice Presidential visit to the 
region refutes the view that the U.S. is supporting other 
segments of Iraqi society at the expense of the Kurds, and 
that Kurdish support for U.S. priorities can cement a 
long-term relationship. 
 
¶5.  (U) Independent "Hawlati" suggested that Cheney reminded 
Kurdish leadership of the "special friendship" that dates 
back to 1991 when the Northern No-Fly Zone protected the 
autonomy of the Kurdistan Region and that the Kurds should 
repay the favor by supporting the Hydrocarbons Law which is 
"like a life preserver to save an America drowning in oil 
price increases."  "Hawlati" goes on to suggest that Barzani 
will in turn demand support for implementation of Article 140 
and security guarantees against foreign (Turkish and Iranian) 
attacks.
