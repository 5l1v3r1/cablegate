¶1.  (U) Summary:  Ref A requested a pre-license end-use check to 
confirm the bona fides of Barnaul Cartridge Plant, the foreign 
end-user on application 05-050077022.  The commodities in question 
are 10.103000 components for ammunition (.224-.355 caliber) valued 
at USD 909,270.00.  A Barnaul Cartridge Plant official with whom we 
met told us his company plans to use the ammunition components in 
this license to manufacture cartridges which will be re-exported to 
the United States.  Barnaul Cartridge Plant has been doing business 
with U.S. companies for approximately 15 years.  We confirm the bona 
fides of Barnaul Cartridge Plant as a reliable recipient of USML 
items.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) In a February 22 meeting Yuriy Belko, the Moscow Office 
Director of the Barnaul Cartridge Plant, confirmed to us his 
company's plans to re-export to the U.S. ammunition that will be 
purchased from Hornady Manufacturing Company under license 
05-050077022.  According to Belko, U.S. bullets are more accurate 
than anything made in Russia, but the other cartridge components, 
such as the case, gunpowder, and primer, can be manufactured in 
Russia much cheaper and of sufficient quality.  His company plans to 
combine U.S. bullets with Russian-made cases, gunpowder, and primer 
to produce cartridges at one-third the cost of U.S.-made ammunition. 
 These cartridges will then be sold in the United States. 
 
¶3.  (U) Belko told us Barnaul Cartridge Plant was first established 
in 1941.  His company has been doing business with U.S. companies 
for about 15 years.  Barnaul Cartridge Plant has been working with 
Hornady Manufacturing Company for approximately 4 years. 
 
¶4.  (U) Barnaul Cartridge Plant sells only to distributors and 
sporting goods stores; not to individual customers.  It regularly 
sells its products to companies around the world.  In Russia, this 
includes Kolchuga Limited, a company we last inspected on August 16, 
2007 (ref B).  In the U.S., Barnaul Cartridge Plant sells many of 
products to DKG Trading, Incorporated and Academy, Limited.  It is 
primarily to these two companies that Barnaul Cartridge Plant 
intends to sell bullets under this license. 
 
¶5.  (U) Belko told us Barnaul Cartridge Plant did not have any 
purchase orders for cartridges to be manufactured under this 
specific license.  He instead showed us a contract his company 
signed with DKG Trading, Incorporated under which Barnaul Cartridge 
Plant will provide 305,823,700 rounds of ammunition.  He said the 
10,103,000 bullets ordered from Hornady Manufacturing Company will 
largely go toward fulfilling this contract. 
 
¶6.  (U) Belko told us Barnaul Cartridge Plant was familiar with the 
restrictions governing the import of USML commodities, and in 
particular the prohibition of unauthorized re-export.  We recommend 
Barnaul Cartridge Plant as a reliable recipient of USML items.
