¶1. (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Jeremy Petit, 
MFA desk officer for Burma on October 24.  Petit said the EU 
is currently considering increased financial sanctions; 
however, he could not provide specifics.  Petit noted France 
supported a complete freeze of all new investments in Burma 
as was outlined on September 26 by President Sarkozy.  He 
added this remains the French policy on French investment 
throughout Burma and specifically in the Yadana gas field. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Petit asked if the U.S. supported putting Burma on 
the Financial Actions Task Force (FATF) non-cooperative 
countries list.  Embassy requests Department guidance to 
respond.
