In Today's Papers 
 
Erdogan Expects Court to Decide on AKP Closure in Late July 
All papers report a Constitutional Court timetable indicates the 
chief prosecutor will give his verbal assessment on July 1 and 
Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek will present the AKP's verbal 
defense on July 3.  The file then will be submitted to the 
rapporteur who will draft a report for the judges before they reach 
a decision, say papers.  On Monday, Prime Minister Erdogan told 
reporters he expected a verdict by the end of July. 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: The AKP's Defense against Closure 
 
"A Weak Defense" 
Gungor Mengi wrote in mainstream Vatan (6/18): "The AKP's defense 
argument is a good example of making a situation worse when trying 
to fix it.  The defense is all about pride, rudeness and 
carelessness.  Instead of outlining a defense what shows the AKP has 
no conflict with secular values, the AKP has exerted all of its 
efforts to explain its own interpretation of secularism.  This comes 
as no surprise because the founders of the AKP have been talking 
about 'redefining secularism' from the very beginning.  The AKP's 
understanding of secularism is clearly flawed because this party 
constantly and deliberately exploits religious values through 
politics.  The AKP defense also argues that 'secularism cannot be a 
lifestyle,' which is a very dangerous approach and can lead to the 
loss of diverse lifestyles and beliefs.  The majority of Turkish 
people share a common wish that the AKP should defend itself against 
closure and should not be closed.  However, the nature of the AKP's 
defense will not help this wish come true." 
 
"What's wrong with the Google Case?" 
Ahmet Hakan wrote in mainstream Hurriyet (6/18):  "The AKP defense 
is largely based on criticism that the Prosecutor's indictment 
relied solely on evidence acquired through Google's search engine. 
It is hard to understand this argument. What can possibly be wrong 
with a prosecutor using technology in order to gain and gather 
information?  In addition, this argument fails to address the 
indictment's charges.  No one would argue against the use of 
newspaper clippings and other printed materials in order to justify 
an indictment.   After all, the information gathered is public 
knowledge.  A condescending attitude against internet research is a 
lame approach.  The AKP should have focused on addressing the 
charges and finding inaccuracies in the indictment." 
 
EU, Standard&Poor's on AKP Closure Case 
Hurriyet, Sabah, Radikal, Taraf, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others report 
Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Ruppel called the closure 
lawsuit against Turkey's ruling AKP was an "extraordinary" case for 
the EU, but would not affect Turkey-EU ties.  "We hope all political 
parties in Turkey will seek solutions in line with legal principles 
and democratic secularism; and we hope after the debates, a solution 
will be found in compliance with the European Court of Human Rights 
rulings and Venice Criteria," Ruppel emphasized.  Slovenia currently 
holds the rotating EU presidency. 
 
Meanwhile, papers report Standard&Poor's Turkey analyst Faruk Soussa 
said the possible closure of the AKP alone would not affect Turkeys' 
credit rating, but, "What matters is how the investors would see 
it."  The fact that political stability and trust appears negative 
doesn't mean Turkeys' ratings will be lowered, according to Soussa. 
He warned tight economic policies might be needed, which could 
affect growth. 
 
A New Gas Pipeline Agreement with Iran 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports that in order to prevent natural gas 
shortage during the winter months, Turkey and Iran agreed to build a 
new gas pipeline.  Iranian Deputy Gas and Oil Minister Riza 
Kasaesizadeh came to Turkey recently to discuss the pipeline and 
both parties agreed on the new gas pipeline.  The new line will come 
 
ANKARA 00001134  002 OF 003 
 
 
directly to Bazergan border gate from Iran's Miandoab province. 
 
Meanwhile, Energy Minister Hilmi Guler answered questions regarding 
reports U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Ross Wilson hinted the U.S. could 
strike Iran.  Guler said, "I had a chat with Ambassador Wilson.  I 
do not want to reveal details.  When we hear such hints or comments, 
we explain our position and our priorities regarding Turkey's 
interests. 
 
Rector Assignments Determined Today and Tomorrow 
Hurriyet reports that university rector elections will be held in 21 
universities today and tomorrow.  Following his appointment of the 
Higher Education Board (YOK) President, President Gul will change 
almost all the rectors, who were assigned by former President Sezer. 
 Because they criticized 'turban freedom' in the universities and 
contradicted the wishes of the government and the YOK on this issue 
recently, Akdeniz University Rector Mustafa Akaydin, METU Rector 
Prof.Ural Akbulut, Ankara University Rector Prof. Nusret Aras, 
Uludag University Rector Prof. Mustafa Abbas Yurtkuran and 19 May 
University Rector Prof. Ferit Bernay will be replaced by new 
rectors. 
 
Controversial Privacy Draft 
Liberal Radikal draws attention to a newly drafted privacy law that 
was submitted by the government to the parliament for approval 
within the framework of EU harmonization reforms.  Even though the 
new draft looks like a modern initiative, some exceptions mentioned 
in the new regulations will give the police, gendarme and 
intelligence service MIT easier access to personal data.  Radikal 
describes the draft as "the footsteps toward a police state."  Bilgi 
University prepared a report on the new draft and drew attention to 
concerns about the exceptions in the bill.  Originally, the bill 
called for a board comprised of NGOs and academics to oversee 
requests for personal data concerning private citizens' ethic 
background and religious affiliation.  However, the government has 
changed the draft so the board will be comprised of government 
officials.  This, Radikal says, will make it easier for the 
Gendarme, MIT, and the police to acquire private data.  Currently, a 
court order is required to access such information.  The new plan 
streamlines the process by allowing the board of government 
officials to approve requests for private information. 
 
Customs Tariffs to be Lowered among Islamic Countries 
Mainstream Hurriyet and Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak report a 
"Preferential Trade System" will be established among members of the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).  "OIC Preferential 
Trade System" talks were held in Ankara yesterday and established 
tax reductions in OIC member states.  The system will take effect in 
January 2009.
