--- ---------- 
¶2. SOCIAL 
-------------- 
 
---ON THE FRONT PAGE, L'OBSERVATEUR OF NOV. 12, 2008 HIGHLIGHTED 
EXPLOITATION OF JOB SEEKERS BY THE CIVIL SERVANTS AT THE MINISTRY OF 
EMPLOYMENT.  ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE, ANYBODY WISHING TO BE HIRED 
BY THE GOVERNMENT MUST PAY  ILLEGAL FEES  RANGING FROM 150,000 TO 
800,000 CFA ($300-$1,600) BEFORE BEING CONSIDERED FOR EMPLOYMENT. 
WHILE QUALIFIED GRADUATES ARE SHUNTED ASIDE , UNQUALIFIED PEOPLE, 
HAVING NO LEGITIMATE DEGREE, ARE IMMEDIATELY HIRED AFTER PAYING THE 
AMOUNT REQUESTED. 
 
----THROUGHOUT THE CITY  PRICES OF FOODSTUFFS ARE  INCREASING, BUT 
THE PRICE OF CHARCOAL, THE UNIQUE SOURCE OF ENERGY FOR COOKING IN 
MOST HOUSEHOLDS, HAS TRIPLED.  DESPITE EFFORTS BY THE GOVERNMENT TO 
CONTROL CHARCOL PRICES, REALITY ON THE GROUND SHOWS THAT SELLERS OF 
THE CHARCOAL ARE PROFITING AND SELLING HIGHER IRRESPECTIVE OF THE 
ESTABLISHED PRICE. CHARCOAL HAS BECOME QUITE DIFFICULT TO FIND. 
 
-----AFTER THREE WEEKS OF STRIKE, THE UNION OF THE CHADIAN STUDENTS 
CALLED FOR THE RESUMPTION OF CLASSES. THEY DECIDED UNANIMOUSLY TO 
RESUME CLASSES AFTER BEING PAID THEIR SCHOLARSHIPS THAT WERE SIX 
MONTHS IN ARREARS.  HOWEVER, ADMINISTRATORS AND LECTURERS AT THE 
UNIVERSITY OF N'DJAMENA WONDERED IF THE SCHOOL YEAR CAN STILL BE 
SAVED OR WHETHER THEY WILL HAVE TO ABANDON IT AND START WITH THE NEW 
ONE "2008 - 2009". 
 
--  A NOMAD CARAVAN OF THIRTY TO FIFTY CAMELS WITH TENTS PERCHED ON 
TOP TRANSITED NDJAMENA OVER THE PAST WEEKEND.  PROBABLY GORAN OR 
ARAB.  THE SEVERAL HUNDRED TRADITIONAL CHADIANS LIVING LIFE AS THEIR 
ANCESTORS HAVE FOR GENERATIONS WERE AN INTERESTING SPECTACLE IN THE 
CITY AND VICE VERSA. 
 
--- IN AN ARTICLE ABOUT LIVING CONDITIONS OF THE REFUGEES AND THE 
DISPLACED IN EASTERN CHAD, N'DJAMENA BI-HEBDO DESCRIBED THAT, 
DESPITE ALL THE EFFORTS BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, THERE ARE NO 
INDICATIONS OF AN END TO INSECURITY.  WARLORDS AND OTHER ARMED 
BANDITS CONTINUE TO VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS ALONG THE BORDER BETWEEN 
CHAD AND SUDAN.  THE STORY GREW OUT OF A SEMINAR ORGANIZED IN ABECHE 
BY THE CHADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS LEAGUE. REGARDING DEMOCRATIZATION, THE 
PRESIDENT OF LTDH, MR. MASSALBAYE TENEBAYE SAID DEMOCRACY IN CHAD IS 
"MOVING BACKWARD." 
 
¶3. ECONOMY 
 
-- PRESIDENT DEBY TURNED OVER THE FIRST SPADEFUL OF DIRT MARKING THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF A FORTY-MILE PAVED ROAD BETWEEN MASSAGUET AND 
 
NDJAMENA 00000526  002 OF 002 
 
 
MASSAKORY.  PART OF THE TRANS-SAHARAN ROUTE, THE IMPROVED ROAD WILL 
IMPROVE ACCESS TO THE LAKE REGION NORTH OF NDJAMENA. 
 
-- THE FAMININE EARLY WARNING REPRESENTATIVE IN CHAD ADVISED THAT 
THE CURRENT HARVEST NATIONWIDE WOULD REPREESENT AN INCREASE OF 2.6 
PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR, WHICH WAS ALSO A GOOD YEAR.  OVERALL FOOD 
PRODUCTION IN CHAD HAS RISEN OVER FIFTEEN PERCENT FROM LOWS OF FIVE 
YEARS AGO.
