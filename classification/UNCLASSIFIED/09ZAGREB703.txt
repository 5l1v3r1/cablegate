SUBJECT: ZAGREB DAILY REPORT - DECEMBER 2, 2009 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Initial Croatian Media Coverage of President,s 
Policy on Afghanistan:  Major dailies gave 
significant coverage to President Obama,s speech, although 
primarily based on reports from senior 
officials, pre-briefs, given the time difference.  All media 
note that the Croatian government remains 
committed to its current deployment of 300 troops.  Several 
articles note that the GoC is considering a 
potential increase of 5 percent, to 315 troops.  (NOTE: 
High-level government sources have confirmed 
to us Croatia,s intent to implement that increase, but that 
no final decision will be made until after the end 
of the current presidential election campaign.  Prime 
Minister Kosor has just issued a statement 
confirming full GoC support for President Obama,s policy; 
post will report on this separately.) 
 
¶2. (U) Ruling Coalition to meet over Fate of Transport 
Minister Kalmeta: Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor 
called a meeting of coalition partners for December 2 to 
discuss the future of Bozidar Kalmeta, the 
Minister of Sea, Transport and Infrastructure over the 
continuing corruption scandal at Croatian 
Highways. Following that meeting, Kosor,s government must 
address a formal demand for Kalmeta,s 
resignation by December 4 which the primary opposition, 
Social Democratic Party (SDP), has forwarded 
to the Parliament. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Croatia Deliberating on South Stream: The Ministry 
of Economy released a statement to Reuters 
early this week announcing Croatia,s interest in joining the 
Russian South Stream gas pipeline, and 
stating they are in intense discussions with the Russian 
side.  Prime Minister Kosor will reportedly visit 
Moscow in January, although no plans or dates have been 
finalized.  Privately, an INA oil company 
executive, who is also advising the Prime Minister informally 
on energy issues, told us that there is 
confusion within the government on all the gas supply 
projects under consideration, including South 
Stream and a planned LNG terminal on the Adriatic coast.  He 
also said, though, that given forecasted 
gas needs, Croatia is not in a position to reject outright 
any potential new sources. 
 
¶4. (U) Embassy Donates Narcotics Field Test Kits:  On Monday, 
November 30, the Embassy donated 80 
narcotics test kits to the Croatian Customs Service.  The 
donation, valued at $21,000 was funded by 
EUCOM,s Counternarcotics and Terrorism office.  The kits 
will be used by customs officers at major 
border crossings to immediately identify suspected 
substances.  Croatia is a transit point along the 
"Balkan Route" for drugs moving between Asia and Europe.
