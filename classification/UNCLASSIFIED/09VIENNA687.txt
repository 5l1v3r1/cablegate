SUBJECT: A Definite "Maybe" from Austria on Pakistan's IDPs 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 58282  B. VIENNA 604 
 
¶1. Post delivered ref A demarche June 8 to the MFA Head of 
Humanitarian Aid, Gerhard Weinberger, and to the MFA Political 
Director, Stefan Lehne.  Weinberger said that the GOA working level 
had been considering a contribution for Pakistan's IDPs, but it 
would be several weeks before a decision was made.  He further 
indicated that if such a contribution were made, it would be a 
nominal amount.  Upon receiving a similarly noncommittal response in 
a separate meeting June 9, Charge pressed Lehne for more definite 
assistance, pointing out the political and domestic Austrian (i.e., 
narcotics trade) implications as well as the humanitarian need. 
 
¶2. The GOA has been very reluctant to have any involvement in 
Pakistan, and had previously ruled out any help in favor of aid to 
Sri Lanka IDPs (ref B). Its few remaining small-scale development 
aid projects are being terminated this year.  Austria last gave 
humanitarian aid to Pakistan after the 2007 earthquake, when it 
helped reconstruct houses and water systems.
