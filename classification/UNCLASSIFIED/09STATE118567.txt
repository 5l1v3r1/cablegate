E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ETTC KOMC CA
SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON THE EXPORT OF U.S. DEFENSE ARTICLES CITING THE CANADIAN 
EXEMPTION 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on transactions citing the 
Canadian exemption for the export of satellite flight 
hardware to Canada.  Embassy is requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a 
Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Under ITAR 126.5 (Canadian Exemption), 
certain United States Munitions List (USML) items may be 
exported to Canada without a license.  Some items on USML 
Category XV - which includes satellite flight hardware - may 
require a license depending on commodity specification and 
type.  DDTC requests this check based on vague description of 
commodity and end-use in export filing.  DDTC notes that 
end-user Macdonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) has 
appeared on numerous DDTC licenses and is a bona fide 
recipient of USML items. 
 
¶4. ACTION OTTAWA: Mission Canada is requested to make 
inquiries with appropriate MDA officials to obtain all 
relevant details regarding the export of satellite flight 
hardware to Canada citing the Canadian exemption, including 
the exact description, number, type, dollar value, and serial 
number of items. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--What were the exact United States Munitions List (USML) 
articles exported to you?  (Automated Export System (AES) 
filing data provides the following information, "satellite 
flight hardware".) 
 
--What is the exact end-use for these USML items?  Will MDA 
be the sole end-user and retain positive control over the 
satellite flight hardware at all times?  Will they be 
transferred to other end-users in Canada or re-exported? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer 
and re-export? 
 
END ACTION.
