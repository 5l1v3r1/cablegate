¶1. Summary and Action Request: Department requests that 
action addressees report on the Interfaith Dialogue 
Conference, which will be held in Spain on July 16-18. This 
conference may serve as the forerunner for a UNGA Special 
Session this fall on the same topic. The Department would 
therefore appreciate reporting on all aspects of the July 
16-18 conference, including preparations, attendees/sponsors, 
conference proceedings, and media coverage/final statements. 
Department would also appreciate reporting on direct 
consultations with the Saudi and Spanish governments 
regarding the event. Per ref B, posts should avoid taking any 
position on the proposed UNGA Special Session itself. End 
Summary and Action Request. 
 
¶2. (U) Background: The government of Spain has agreed to 
serve as logistical host for a Muslim World League (MWL) 
Interfaith Dialogue Conference on July 16-18, 2008. According 
to a release by the Saudi Press Agency, the purpose of the 
meeting is for Muslim religious leaders and leaders of other 
religious faiths to discuss "life in human societies, 
international cooperation, human rights, and issues of 
security, peace and living together in the world." Though it 
is unclear who will be invited to the conference, MWL 
Secretary-General Dr. Abdullah al-Turki mentioned "dialogue 
with followers of divine messages, and eastern ideologies," 
according to the Jeddah Arab News. This will be the second 
meeting held under the auspices of Saudi King Abdullah, the 
first occurring earlier this year in Saudi Arabia between 
Sunni and Shiite religious leaders. 
 
¶3. (U) Background (continued): Per ref A, UN Secretary 
General Ban told Ambassador Khalilzad on June 20 that Saudi 
King Abdullah asked for the SYG's help in arranging a Special 
Session of the upcoming UN General Assembly (fall 2008) on 
the political and religious components of interfaith 
dialogue. This Special Session would build on previous Saudi 
efforts to promote interfaith dialogue, including the June 4 
Inter-Muslim conference in Saudi Arabia and the July 16-18 
conference in Spain. Ban sought U.S. views. The U.S. will 
look to the July 16-18 conference in Spain in developing its 
positions on this proposed Special Session. Specific areas of 
interest include: 
 
-- Involvement of, or reference to, the Alliance of 
Civilizations organization (AoC) or the Organization of the 
Islamic Conference (OIC); 
 
-- Reference to the concept of "Defamation of Religions"; 
 
-- References to "Zionism as racism"; 
 
-- Religious faiths and nationalities invited to attend the 
conference, particularly moderate Shiite and Sunni Muslims 
from a range of countries; Sufi Muslims; Christians from 
predominantly Muslim countries; Jews (please see 7/6/08 
article in Gulf News, "Saudi official denies Israeli rabbi 
invited to forum," mentioning an intention not to invite 
Israeli Jews); Bahais; non-Abrahamic faiths such as Hindus 
and Buddhists; and agnostics and atheists; 
 
-- Role, if any, of NGOs; 
 
-- Political themes, including references to U.S. policies; 
and 
 
-- References to future meetings. 
 
¶4. (U) In light of the imminent approach of the conference, 
posts should report back initially no later than Thursday, 
July 10, notifying Department of POC name and contact 
information.
