SUBJECT: RWANDA REACTION: PRESIDENT'S INTERVIEW WITH 
AL-ARABIYA 
 
REF: STATE 7500 
 
 
¶1. (U) Poloff delivered reftel talking points and interview 
transcript to Rwandan Mufti Sheikh Saleh Habimana on February 
¶2.  Habimana said he hopes the United States will fully 
utilize the "opportunity" presented by President Obama's 
election to engage with the Muslim world, and make the strong 
distinction between Muslims as a whole and "the very small 
minority" of extreme terrorist elements.  Habimana expressed 
his personal admiration for President Obama, and produced a 
copy of the President's inaugural address, saying he has 
referred to it regularly.  In conclusion, Habimana reiterated 
the high regard in which Rwandan Muslims and Rwandans 
generally hold the United States. 
 
¶2. (U) Comment.  Rwanda's Muslim community is relatively 
small (approximately five percent of the population), but it 
has been generally well-disposed toward the United States. 
Outreach, such as the President's interviews and increased 
dialogue with the Muslim world by the administration, 
particularly in Africa, will be well received locally.  End 
comment.
