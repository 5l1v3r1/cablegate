SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  On May 24, the Embassy hosted a workshop on intellectual 
property rights (IPR), which attracted an audience of nearly 
50 people, including actors, musicians, authors, designers, 
screen-writers, union representatives, business owners, 
gendarmes, customs officers and other GOS officials.  The 
Ambassador addressed the workshop on the impact of IPR 
violations on the economy and on personal safety and health. 
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) representative 
Michael Adlin also made a presentation via DVD.  The 
workshop, which generated substantial local media coverage, 
led to a demand by participants for follow-up events.  A 
member of the Customs Director General's Office, who was in 
attendance, asked for cooperation with U.S. Customs in order 
to tighten its procedures.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MUCH CREATIVITY AND MUCH INFRINGEMENT 
------------------------------------- 
¶2.  Senegal has suffered from contradictory trends of 
increasing literary and artistic creativity, plus a growing 
incidence of IPR infringement.  Senegal has produced world 
famous musicians, such as Youssou Ndour and Ismail Lo, 
writers, and artists, and is at the forefront of Africa's 
pharmaceutical and computer industries.  At the same time, 
Senegalese products have been pirated or counterfeited openly 
in Senegal's markets, alongside exported works, and with few 
repercussions.  This has led some musicians, artists and 
writers to abandon their work and seek other livelihoods. 
 
IPR AS A POLICY TOOL AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHT 
----------------------------------------- 
¶3.  The Director General of the Bureau Senegalais du Droit 
d'Auteur (BSDA), Senegal's copyright office, made an opening 
speech in which she discussed the importance of IPR as a tool 
for use in the formulation of economic and cultural policy, 
as well as a source of inspiration for creativity.  Director 
General Ndeye Siby also discussed Senegal's need for a modern 
judicial framework, referring to the bill she helped draft to 
update Senegal's copyright laws (Reftel).  She stressed two 
points:  (1) IPR must not be an instrument for division 
between the developing and developed world; and (2) everyone 
has the fundamental right to express their cultural identity. 
 
AMBASSADOR JACOBS' REMARKS 
-------------------------- 
¶4.  Ambassador Jacobs echoed Siby's words by saying everyone 
has the right to enjoy the fruits of their intellectual labor 
and by adding that such labor is an important element in 
economic growth.  Although all the Ambassador's remarks were 
well received, the moment having the most impact was when she 
described the cost of trade in illegal products in terms of 
lost revenue and risks to individual safety and health.  Her 
comments were subsequently cited by many participants as well 
as local media, including the pro-government daily Le Soleil, 
major radio station Sud FM, the Senegalese Press Agency and 
several other national newspapers. 
 
THE U.S. PERSPECTIVE 
-------------------- 
¶5.  USPTO's Michael Adlin and Michael Schlesinger, Vice 
President of the International Intellectual Property Alliance 
(IIPA), spoke of the misguided belief that IPR infringement 
is not a concern for Africa.  Adlin noted the fact that 
African artists and students are going elsewhere; African 
governments are missing out on tax revenue from sales of 
legitimate products; and other countries are unwilling to 
transfer technology to Africa because of the lack of 
security.  Schlesinger demonstrated the importance of 
cultural ideas to the U.S. economy and pointed out the need 
for Senegal to create a framework for nurturing and 
protecting artists. 
 
AN ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE BY PARTICIPANTS 
---------------------------------------- 
¶6.  Participants responded to all presentations with spirited 
comments and questions.  One common theme was the need for 
concerted political will to harmonize Senegal's IPR laws with 
its commitments under international agreements, such as those 
under the World Trade Organization (WTO), to enforce IPR laws 
already on its books, and to stop importing infringing goods. 
 Captain Ndiaye of the Customs Office agreed the law needs to 
be revised and said he wants to stop the flow of infringing 
goods, which leads to a "society in decay." 
 
IRC SUPPORT FOR THE WORKSHOP 
----------------------------

¶7.  In support of the workshop, post's Information Resource 
Center (IRC) showcased background material in French and 
English on IPR, including a webliography of key Internet 
sites reflecting U.S. policies and accomplishments in this 
area.  The IRC offered copies of the IIP publications, "Droit 
de la Propriete Intellectuelle" and the "Bush Administration 
Strategy of Targeting Organized Piracy," as well as 
information on the Intellectual Property Rights Training 
Program Database.  Several government officials in 
attendance, including BSDA Director General Siby and Ndeye 
Adji Diop Sall, Director of the Office of Intellectual 
Property at the Ministry of Industry, signed up to receive 
additional information from the IRC on IPR issues. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶8.  The large turn-out showed a growing interest in 
addressing the problem head-on.  The invitees were so eager 
to discuss among themselves that they did not want to take 
breaks during the four and one-half hour session.  Many 
thanked Embassy staff for hosting the workshop and pleaded 
for follow-up events to focus on more specific issues, such 
as problems facing handicraft artisans and textile 
manufacturers.  Embassy plans to encourage development of 
focus groups to work on such specific issues and also to meet 
with Senegal's Customs Office and discuss ways it can work 
with US Customs to improve procedures.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶9.  Michael Adlin has cleared this message.
