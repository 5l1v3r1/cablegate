SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (11/13): Palestinian Central 
Elections Commission says it must postpone elections 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The local press highlights news on the chairman of the Central 
Elections Commission Hanna Nasser announcing yesterday that the 
commission does not have the capacity to hold elections on January 
24 due to Hamas' rejection of the elections. Nasser said in a press 
conference that the commission sent a letter to Palestinian 
Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas explaining the situation, 
noting that it is not up to the commission to decide when to hold 
elections if they are not held on the 24th. 
 
Maan and the three dailies report on Nabil Abu Rudeina, spokesperson 
for the PA Office of the President, saying that President Abbas will 
issue a decision "in light of this development" following 
consultations with Palestinian institutions and Basic Law experts. 
Abu Rudeina accused Hamas of imposing a ban on the Central Elections 
Commission from entering Gaza, calling it "evidence that Hamas does 
not value the unity of the homeland or national reconciliation." 
 
The coverage also quotes Hamas official in Gaza Sami Abu Zuhiri as 
saying that he was not surprised that the elections would be 
postponed, adding that "this is a natural result of the lack of 
appropriate conditions" to hold elections and that "it is evidence 
of the credibility of Hamas' position, which rejected the call for 
elections before reconciliation is achieved." 
 
Secretary General of the Arab League Amer Mousa's announcement that 
the Palestinian national reconciliation dialogue will restart after 
the Adha feast in Egypt receives front page coverage in the 
dailies. 
 
Al-Quds front pages news on settlers from Yitzhar settlement near 
Nablus city in the northern West Bank attacking the Palestinian 
citizens of Boureen village and cutting down more than 80 olive 
trees yesterday. 
 
Al-Quds front pages news on Palestinian Human Rights and legal 
institutions condemning the Hamas attack against Ramattan news 
agency and its refusal to allow any commemoration events on the 5th 
anniversary of Arafat's death.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
Adel Abdel Rahman opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily under 
the title "The Elections and the Veto," (11/13): "The Central 
Elections Commission announcement that they cannot hold the 
elections demonstrates weakness ... It shows that the Commission has 
given in to Hamas ... Clearly Hamas is obstructing any national 
principle that would end the state of division and retain the 
national unity. I call upon Hanna Nasser [the head of the Central 
Elections Commission] not to give in to Hamas and to find any 
mechanism to hold elections on time."

Cartoon of the week: 
------------------- 
 
This cartoon appeared in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily on 
November 12. It shows President Obama repeating his campaign slogan 
"Yes We Can" while an ironic translation of the word "can" is 
illustrated. "Can" in Arabic stands for the state of the past tense 
 
JERUSALEM 00002041  002 OF 002 
 
 
meaning "it was," demonstrating that Obama's slogans are from the 
past and no longer valid.
