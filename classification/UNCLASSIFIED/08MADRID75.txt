¶1. (U) EconOff spoke on 1/24/08 with Repsol's (Repsol is a 
multi-billion-dollar Spanish private oil & gas exploration 
and development company) Director of Institutional Relations, 
Tomas Garcia, regarding possible Repsol interest in investing 
in Burma.  Garcia told EconOff that Repsol had and has no 
interest in Burma.  Repsol is focussed on North Africa and 
Latin America. 
 
¶2. (U) Separately, Ministry of Foreign Affairs contacts have 
told Embassy officials that they appreciate being kept 
informed regarding American sanctions against Burma, but that 
Spain does not have an Embassy in Rangoon and maintains only 
limited contact with the country.  The GOS supports EU 
consensus positions on Burma, including possible punitive 
actions.  The GOS would appreciate being kept informed on 
future U.S. initiatives to help the Burmese people.
