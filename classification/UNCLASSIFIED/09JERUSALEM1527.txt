SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (08/27): Press speculates on 
outcome of London meeting 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
The local press lead with news on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu's meeting with US Special Envoy George Mitchell in London 
on August 26. All reports note that the meeting did not result in a 
breakthrough on the settlements issue. In its lead headline, 
Al-Ayyam reports "Failure of Netanyahu-Mitchell meeting" and 
continues "Israel rejects any freeze to settlement construction." 
Reports note the joint statement issued after the meeting saying 
that it is important for Israel to pursue serious talks with the 
Palestinians and to work towards achieving a comprehensive peace. 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Quds run front page stories citing the Guardian that 
the US is very close to reaching an agreement with Israel to restart 
negotiations with the Palestinians. The reports note that President 
Barack Obama received a commitment from the Israeli government for a 
partial freeze of settlement construction in return for the US 
taking tougher measures against Iran, including additional 
sanctions. 
 
All dailies report on Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud 
Abbas chairing the extraordinary session of the Palestinian National 
Council in Ramallah on August 26 to appoint 6 new members to the 
Fatah Central Committee [Note. The session lasted until 4am and so 
the papers did not report on the eventual appointees. End Note]. In 
his speech, Abbas reiterated that Israel must halt all settlement 
activity in order to resume the peace process and stressed that all 
parties must fulfill their Roadmap obligations. Abbas also stated 
that presidential and legislative elections are the only means 
forward if the Palestinian national dialogue fails. 
 
The local press highlights the Elders' group meeting with PA Prime 
Minister Salam Fayyad in Ramallah on August 26. Fayyad briefed the 
delegation on recent developments in the Palestinian territories and 
presented his government's plan for ending the occupation and 
building an independent Palestinian state. Fayyad is quoted saying 
"it is time for the Palestinians to enjoy freedom and to end the 
occupation." Former US President Jimmy Carter noted that the Elders' 
group is concerned with the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza and 
called for an end to the closure. He also urged Israel to stop home 
demolitions and land confiscation in East Jerusalem. 
 
News on a potential deal to release kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad 
Shalit dominates front page coverage in all dailies. The reports 
note that a Hamas delegation in Cairo is negotiating with the 
Egyptians and Germans on a possible prisoner exchange deal.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1)Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title 
"Activating the Palestinian official institutions" (08/27): "The 
Palestinians have recently sensed a great improvement in their 
institutions due to the rule of law and order, the launching of many 
development projects, and the creation of new jobs under the 
leadership of Salam Fayyad. His agenda proves that he is committed 
to establishing an independent Palestinian state regardless of the 
obstacles."

2) Abdel Majeed Sweilem opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under 
the headline "Fatah and the current national crisis" 
(08/27):"Reforming the Palestinian Liberation Organization is not an 
option and is not a demand, it is a real need for Fatah so that it 
can respond to internal and external threats and put an end to 
internal Palestinian division."
