 ¶1. On January 18, Econoff delivered reftel demarche to 
Santiago Quiros, Case Officer from the Ministry of 
Infrastructure's Civil Aviation Directorate.  Econoff 
informed Quiros that in August 2007, potential Spanish 
citizen Jose Munoz allegedly violated U.S. federal aviation 
regulations by smoking on board a Continental Airlines flight 
on route to Newark, NJ from Paris.  Quiros expressed 
appreciation for the notification but advised Econoff that 
under GOS regulations, the Spanish government can only pursue 
an investigation if the air carrier is of Spanish provenance 
or if the incident occurs over Spanish airspace.  Spanish 
regulations do not permit the Civil Aviation Directorate to 
pursue a case based on the individual's nationality.  Since 
the aircraft is not/not of Spanish origin, and there is no 
indication that the infraction occurred over Spanish 
airspace, the GOS has opted not to take action. 
 
¶2. Post will return the files pertaining to Mr. Jose Munoz 
(2007EA250090) to EEB/TRA/OTP via diplomatic pouch.
