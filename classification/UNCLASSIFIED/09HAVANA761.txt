SUBJECT: CUBA ENDS SCHEME TO TRADE IN CLUNKERS 
 
HAVANA 00000761  001.3 OF 002 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  The Government of Cuba (GOC) reportedly froze a 
scheme this month in which certain Cubans could obtain 
authorization to import a personal vehicle.  This luxury was 
only available to Cubans who already owned a vehicle and had 
permission to travel abroad for business-related purposes. 
Like regulations on other highly valued items (houses, exit 
permits, etc.), the car scheme had created an unusual 
informal market for fake marriages and permission slips. 
Frustrated Cubans shopping for a personal vehicle are now 
forced to return their attention to the rapidly decaying 
supply of 1950s American cars and 1980s Russian Ladas. 
Simple economic freedoms are hard to come by in Cuba and, 
more often than not, too fleeting to make a difference. 
 
THE REQUIREMENTS 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  An eligible Cuban who already owns a car and travels 
abroad for work would first need permission from his/her 
government minister or organization head, and then from the 
chief of Cuban Customs.  Once all permissions were granted, 
the eligible Cuban would deliver his/her old car to the GOC 
in exchange for nothing more than a piece of paper confirming 
the car specifications (i.e. the GOC gets the old car for 
free).  The eligible Cuban could then purchase and arrange to 
import a vehicle of a similar type (car for car, motorcycle 
for motorcycle, truck for truck, etc.) and engine size as the 
one traded in. 
 
GETTING AROUND THE REQUIREMENTS 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Despite stringent requirements, several Cubans took 
advantage of the scheme and several more created inventive 
ways to become eligible.  Cubans without a car but with 
access to foreign currency (through remittances, work for a 
foreign mission or company, or black market activity) 
actively looked for an old clunker to purchase that they 
would then deliver to the GOC.  The Craig's List-style 
website Revolico.com is full of Cubans looking for cheap cars 
to trade in.  Online and informal markets were created by 
people looking for and selling the permission slips required 
to import a car.  We have also heard examples of Cubans with 
an old car and enough money to buy a new one, but who are not 
eligible for this scheme because their job does not require 
foreign travel, arranging to marry another Cuban who does 
travel for work.  For a fee, the eligible Cuban marries the 
ineligible Cuban, trades in the now jointly-owned old car, 
buys and imports the new car, and then quietly arranges for a 
divorce. 
 
THE END OF A SCHEME 
------------------- 
 
¶4.  The car importing regulation was first issued in 2007, 
but was not widely used until the GOC issued a clarifying 
regulation earlier this year.  As mysteriously as it sprang 
up, the GOC suspended the scheme in early December without 
explanation or clarification as to what would happen to 
transactions already in process.  Some Cubans are left in 
limbo.  One Cuban artist, for example, traded in his car and 
bought a $10,000 car that is currently in Canada.  The artist 
does not know if the GOC will still permit the import. 
 
¶5.  The GOC has not published or publicized the end of this 
scheme, but Cubans we talk with are aware of its demise.  The 
reasons for its termination are less clear.  Some contacts 
believe the GOC was starting to lose control of the scheme 
(through some of the creative activities noted in paragraph 
3) and may try to start it again under more strict 
guidelines.  Another feasible explanation is that the GOC 
wanted to stop the flow of foreign currency outside of the 
country at a time of internal financial crisis. 
 
REMAINING ALTERNATIVES 
---------------------- 
 
¶6.  Only a small percentage of Cubans own personal vehicles. 
Cubans who owned cars before the first years of the 
revolution were able to keep one.  These cars can be legally

sold, or, more specifically, "transferred" to another Cuban. 
The GOC has since offered a few schemes to purchase newer, 
mostly European vehicles.  For example, the GOC offered a 
scheme in the 1980s in which Cubans could sell their gold and 
silver possessions to the GOC for hard currency, which could 
then be used to buy a new car (typically a Russian Lada).  In 
some cases, Cubans can buy their work vehicle from a 
ministry, state company or other government organization. 
The GOC does not permit the resale of these "newer" cars, 
however there is a large informal market to buy and sell cars 
"without papers".  The few foreign car dealerships within 
Cuba only sell to state companies and foreigners. 
 
A SMALL OPENING CLOSED 
---------------------- 
 
¶7.  Many Cubans are frustrated by the end of a scheme that 
offered the only feasible path to buy a new (or newer) car. 
Even though few Cubans were eligible for the program under 
the strict regulations, ineligible Cubans created ways to 
take advantage of this small economic opening much in the 
same way Cubans (with money) have turned the burdensome rules 
permitting the trading of houses into a viable real estate 
market (septel).  Cubans also complain that, as in the daily 
hunt for food and other consumer goods, unnecessarily 
restrictive regulations such as the car scheme and trading of 
houses force otherwise law-abiding citizens to turn to the 
black market and, sometimes, commit fraud.
