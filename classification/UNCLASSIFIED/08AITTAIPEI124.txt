Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage January 25 on the fraud of the French bank Societe 
Generale; on the secret meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and 
KMT Chairman Wu Po-hsiung; and disputes over the UN referenda 
proposed by both the KMT and the DPP.  In terms of editorials and 
commentaries, an editorial in the pro-independence, English-language 
"Taipei Times" said that China only needs patience, not missiles, to 
acquire Taiwan, because the United States and the international 
community have been humoring China.  The editorial also criticized 
both presidential candidates, Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT and Frank 
Hsieh of the DPP, for failing to see the threats posed by China. 
End summary. 
 
"China Doesn't Need Missiles" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language "Taipei Times" [circulation: 
30,000] editorialized (1/25): 
 
"Late last month, Malawi yielded to the old carrot-and-stick routine 
and abandoned 42 years of diplomatic relations with Taiwan in favor 
of ties with China. Within days, the Malawian minister responsible 
for brokering the deal has reportedly fled the country with millions 
of yuan meant as a 'sweetener' for his president. ... 
 
"And yet, China is still not satisfied and never misses an 
opportunity to belittle Taiwan on the world stage. The most recent 
example of this occurred during the Women's World Cup of Golf this 
week at Sun City, South Africa, where Taiwan's Wei Yun-jye and Amy 
Hung finished third. China's team, which finished 13th, convinced 
the hosts that our national flag should not be displayed. 
 
"Together with the 'autonomous regions' of Xinjiang and Tibet, 
Taiwan is claimed by China, which insists that no other country 
should meddle in its 'domestic affairs.' 
 
"In this light, it is odd that China has asked the US to condemn 
Taiwan's referendums on UN membership. It is even stranger that 
Washington has happily obliged, with everyone from American 
Institute in Taiwan Director Stephen Young to US Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice saying the plebiscites are unnecessary, provocative 
and of no real benefit. 
 
"Despite Taiwan's dutiful attempts to play a responsible role in the 
world, it seems most countries are happy to humor China by not 
publicly contradicting its claim to Taiwan. It is sad that so many 
nations lack the courage to do the right thing. ... 
 
"In view of this imminent threat, it is remarkable that Democratic 
Progressive Party presidential candidate Frank Hsieh and his Chinese 
Nationalist Party (KMT) counterpart Ma Ying-jeou are competing to 
see who can best implement cross-strait flights. 
 
"Yes, increased trade with China may boost the economy. But that 
does not mean that the threat posed by China should be laughed off. 
And yet that is the message being sent by the country's presidential 
candidates, notwithstanding Ma's recent lecture on boosting the 
military. 
 
"Hsieh may be trying to neutralize Ma's 'it's the economy, stupid' 
argument, but that makes his actions only marginally more 
forgivable. 
 
"If this is the mindset of the men who are competing to lead this 
country, then China doesn't need missiles to annex Taiwan: All it 
needs is patience."
