DECEMBER 5, 1986 
 
SYRIAN SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM:  1983-1986 
 
NEW EVIDENCE OF SYRIAN SUPPORT FOR AND DIRECT INVOLVEMENT 
IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT IN 
TWO RECENT TRIALS INCLUDING THE CONVICTION IN GREAT 
BRITAIN OF NIZAR HINDAWI FOR THE ATTEMPTED BOMBING OF AN 
EL AL CIVILIAN AIRPLANE WITH 375 PASSENGERS ABOARD. 
 
SYRIA CLEARLY HAS A LONG RECORD OF INVOLVEMENT IN 
TERRORISM.  SYRIA IS ONE OF THE "CHARTER MEMBERS" OF 
COUNTRIES ON THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S TERRORISM LIST, WHICH 
WAS FIRST COMPILED IN 1979.  (COUNTRIES CURRENTLY ON THE 
LIST ARE SYRIA, LIBYA, IRAN, SOUTH YEMEN, AND CUBA.) 
 
THE PATTERN OF SYRIAN ACTIVITY IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM 
HAS VARIED.  FROM THE MID-1970'S THROUGH 1983, SYRIAN 
PERSONNEL ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN 
TERRORIST OPERATIONS.  THESE OPERATIONS WERE PRIMARILY 
DIRECTED AGAINST OTHER ARABS, SUCH AS SYRIAN DISSIDENTS, 
MODERATE ARAB STATES SUCH AS JORDAN, AND PRO-ARAFAT 
PALESTINIANS, AS WELL AS ISRAELI AND JEWISH TARGETS.  IN 
1982, FOR EXAMPLE, A CAR BOMB EXPLODED IN FRONT OF THE 
OFFICES OF A LEBANESE-OWNED PRO-IRAQI NEWSPAPER IN 
DOWNTOWN PARIS, KILLING ONE PERSON AND INJURING SCORES OF 
OTHERS.  FRANCE LATER EXPELLED TWO SYRIAN DIPLOMATS AND 
ORDERED ITS AMBASSADOR HOME FOR CONSULTATIONS. 
 
BY LATE 1983 DAMASCUS HAD CURTAILED USE OF ITS OWN 
PERSONNEL.  INSTEAD, IT BEGAN TO RELY MORE HEAVILY ON 
TERRORIST GROUPS MADE UP OF NON-SYRIANS WHO HAVE BASES 
AND TRAINING FACILITIES IN SYRIA AND SYRIAN-OCCUPIED 
AREAS OF LEBANON.  THE MOST NOTORIOUS OF THESE IS THE ABU 
NIDAL ORGANIZATION. 
 
AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT SYRIA PREFERS TO 
SUPPORT GROUPS WHOSE ACTIVITIES ARE GENERALLY IN LINE 
WITH SYRIAN OBJECTIVES, RATHER THAN TO SELECT TARGETS OR 
CONTROL OPERATIONS ITSELF.  DAMASCUS UTILIZES THESE 
GROUPS TO ATTACK OR INTIMIDATE ENEMIES AND OPPONENTS AND 
TO EXERT ITS INFLUENCE IN THE REGION.  YET AT THE SAME 
TIME IT CAN DISAVOW KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR OPERATIONS.  SUCH 
SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS HAVE CARRIED OUT SCORES OF 
ATTACKS AGAINST PALESTINIAN AND OTHER ARAB, TURKISH, 
ISRAELI AND WESTERN TARGETS DURING THE PAST THREE 
YEARS. 
 
THIS YEAR, INVESTIGATIONS INTO MAJOR INCIDENTS HAVE 
REVEALED ANOTHER CHANGE IN SYRIAN ACTIVITIES:  THAT SYRIA 
HAS NOT ABANDONED ITS WILLINGNESS TO BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED 
IN TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THE BRITISH TRIAL AND 
INVESTIGATION OF THE ABORTIVE EL AL BOMBING EXPOSED THE 
DIRECT INVOLVEMENT OF PRESIDENT ASSAD'S INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICES.  AND THE WEST BERLIN TRIAL INTO THE BOMBING OF 
THE GERMAN-ARAB FRIENDSHIP UNION IN WEST BERLIN REVEAED 
THE INVOLVEMENT OF SYRIAN OFFICIALS.  TO A LARGE DEGREE, 
SYRIA HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN COVERING ITS TRACKS.  NOW, 
HOWEVER, IN BRITAIN AND BERLIN, EVIDENCE OF MORE DIRECT 
SYRIAN INVOLVEMENT HAS EMERGED. 
 
 
LONDON AND BERLIN INVESTIGATIONS 
 
IN THE BRITISH INVESTIGATION OF THE ABORTED EL AL ATTACK, 
HINDAWI TOLD BRITISH POLICE HE WAS RECRUITED BY HAITHAM 
SAID, AN AIDE TO MAJOR GENERAL AL-KHULI, CHIEF OF SYRIAN 
AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE.  ACCORDING TO THE EVIDENCE 
PRESENTED AT THE TRIAL, AL-KHULI'S OPERATIVES: (1) 
SUPPLIED HINDAWI, A JORDANIAN, WITH A SYRIAN PASSPORT; 
(2) GAVE HIM DOLLARS 12,000 AND PROMISED HIM MORE MONEY 
WHEN HE COMPLETED HIS MISSION TO PLANT A BOMB ABOARD AN 
EL AL CIVILIAN AIRLINER; (3) PROVIDED HIM WITH THE BOMB 
WHICH WAS CARRIED INTO LONDON ABOARD THE SYRIAN ARAB 
AIRLINES, WHICH ALSO GAVE HIM SAA CREW MEMBER HOTEL 
ACCOMMODATIONS; AND (4) TRAINED HIM IN THE BOMB'S USE. 
 
HINDAWI TRIED TO USE HIS PREGNANT GIRL FRIEND AS THE 
UNWITTING CARRIER OF THE SOPHISTICATED BOMB WHICH WAS 
BUILT INTO HER CARRY-ON BAG.  IF AN ALERT SECURITY 
OFFICIAL HAD NOT SPOTTED THE DEVICE AFTER HER BAG CLEARED 
AN EARLIER CHECK, 375 INNOCENT PERSONS, INCLUDING SOME 
230 AMERICANS, WOULD HAVE PERISHED. 
 
AFTER THE APRIL 17 PLAN FAILED, ACCORDING TO EVIDENCE 
PRESENTED AT THE TRIAL, HINDAWI FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS TO 
GO TO THE SYRIAN EMBASSY, WHERE HE WAS GREETED BY THE 
AMBASSADOR AND HIDDEN IN A SYRIAN SAFEHOUSE IN LONDON. 
BRITISH PRESS REPORTS OF THE INVESTIGATION SAY BRITAIN 
ALSO HAS EVIDENCE THAT THE SYRIAN AMBASSADOR IN LONDON 
WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THE 
ATTEMPTED BOMBING IN RECRUITING HINDAWI FOR SYRIAN 
INTELLIGENCE. 
 
IN WEST BERLIN, HINDAWI'S BROTHER, AHMAD HASI, AND 
ANOTHER ARAB, FAROUK SALAMEH, WERE CONVICTED FOR THE 
MARCH 29 BOMBING OF THE GERMAN-ARAB FRIENDSHIP UNION IN 
WEST BERLIN IN WHICH ELEVEN PERSONS WERE INJURED.  IN A 
SWORN STATEMENT, HASI SAID HE PICKED UP THIS BOMB AT THE 
SYRIAN EMBASSY IN EAST BERLIN FROM A SENIOR SYRIAN AIR 
FORCE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, HAITHEM SAEED, AND A SYRIAN 
EXPLOSIVES EXPERT WAS SENT FROM DAMASCUS TO REPAIR THE 
DEVICE AFTER IT TWICE FAILED TO EXPLODE. 
 
ABU NIDAL 
 
SYRIA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE MOST ACTIVE AND BRUTAL 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUP OPERATING TODAY, ABU NIDAL. 
(SEE NOTE BELOW)  ALTHOUGH ABU NIDAL NOW ALSO RECEIVES 
BACKING AND SUPPORT FROM LIBYA, AND SANCTUARY IN EASTERN 
EUROPE, DAMASCUS HAS PROVIDED ABU NIDAL WITH IMPORTANT 
LOGISTICAL SUPPORT EVER SINCE THE GROUP MOVED FROM IRAQ 
IN 1983.  SYRIA ALLOWS ABU NIDAL'S GROUP TO MAINTAIN 
TRAINING CAMPS IN THE LEBANESE BIQA' VALLEY, AN AREA 
UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE SYRIAN ARMED FORCES.  SYRIA 
PROVIDES THE GROUP WITH TRAVEL DOCUMENTS AND PERMITS ITS 
OPERATIVES TO TRANSIT FREELY THROUGH DAMASCUS WHEN 
DEPARTING ON MISSIONS.  SYRIA CONTINUES TO PERMIT 
OPERATION OF ABU NIDAL FACILITIES IN DAMASCUS.  (THE 
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ASSERTS THAT THE SOLE FUNCTION OF THESE 
FACILITIES IS LIMITED TO CULTURAL AND POLITICAL AFFAIRS.) 
 
ALTHOUGH LAST DECEMBER'S ROME AIRPORT ATTACK WAS 
COMMITTED UNDER LIBYAN SPONSORSHIP, THE SURVIVING MEMBER 
OF THE FOUR-MAN TERRORIST TEAM, ACCORDING TO REPORTS ON 
THE ITALIAN INVESTIGATION, TOLD INVESTIGATORS THE TEAM 
WAS TRAINED IN SYRIAN-OCCUPIED AREAS OF LEBANON BY 
SYRIANS.  THE TEAM THEN TRAVELED TO DAMASCUS, WHERE IT 
REMAINED WHILE FINAL PREPARATIONS WERE MADE FOR THE 
ATTACK IN WHICH 16 CIVILIANS AND 3 TERRORISTS WERE 
KILLED. 
 
IN ANKARA ON NOVEMBER 6, TURKISH PROSECUTERS ISSUED AN 
INDICTMENT ACCUSING SIX PALESTINIANS WORKING FOR THE ABU 
NIDAL ORGANIZATION OF KILLING A JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT IN 
JULY, 1985.  THE INDICTMENT ALSO LINKED THE MEN WITH FOUR 
OTHER ACTIONS, INCLUDING THE SEPTEMBER 6, 1986 ATTACK ON 
AN ISTANBUL SYNAGOGUE, KILLING 21 PERSONS AND A 1983 
ATTEMPT TO PLACE A BOMB ON AN ALITALIA FLIGHT, AND THE 
ATTEMPTED CAR BOMBING OF A U.S. OFFICERS CLUB IN IZMIR IN 
¶1983. 
 
(BEGIN NOTE)  THE OFFICIAL NAME OF THE ABU NIDAL 
ORGANIZATION IS "FATAH - REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL."  IT IS 
HEADED BY SABRI AL-BANNA, A PALESTINIAN WHO USES THE NOM 
DE GUERRE ABU NIDAL.  THE GROUP'S ORIGINAL NAME WAS THE 
BLACK JUNE ORGANIZATION WHEN IT WAS FORMED IN 1976. 
IRONICALLY, THIS GROUP FIRST CONCENTRATED ON SYRIAN 
TARGETS, INCLUDING AN ATTACK ON SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
KHADDAM, NOW VICE PRESIDENT, IN 1977.  (END NOTE) 
 
THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION'S MOVE TO SYRIA IN 1983 WAS 
FOLLOWED BY A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE GROUP'S TERRORIST 
ATTACKS:  MORE THAN A DOZEN ATTACKS IN 1984 AND TWICE 
THAT NUMBER IN 1985.  MORE THAN HALF OF THE 1985 ATTACKS 
OCCURRED IN WESTERN EUROPE, INCLUDING ATTACKS ON BRITISH 
TOURISTS AT HOTELS IN ATHENS.   WHEN KING HUSSEIN 
LAUNCHED HIS FEBRUARY 1985 PEACE INITIATIVE, JORDAN 
BECAME A MAJOR TARGET.  BUT WHEN JORDANIAN-SYRIAN 
RELATIONS BEGAN TO WARM IN MID-1985, ATTACKS ON 
JORDANIANS AT HOME AND ABROAD DIMINISHED. 
 
IN ITS DEALINGS WITH WESTERN COUNTRIES, SYRIA HAS 
CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO PLAY DOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF ITS 
CONNECTION WITH ABU NIDAL AND HAS DENIED PERMITTING HIS 
GROUP TO ENGAGE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  HOWEVER, THERE IS 
NO EVIDENCE THAT DAMASCUS HAS ACTUALLY RESTRAINED ABU 
NIDAL'S ACTIVITIES (ABU NIDAL TRAINING CAMPS IN THE 
SYRIAN-CONTROLLED BIQA' VALLEY CONTINUE TO OPERATE FOR 
EXAMPLE) OR CUT BACK ON OTHER FORMS OF SUPPORT.  ALTHOUGH 
IT MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT EVERY OPERATION, GIVEN THE AMOUNT 
AND NATURE OF SYRIAN SUPPORT, DAMASCUS COULD INFLUENCE 
AND CONSTRAIN THE ABU NIDAL GROUP'S ACTIVITIES IN SYRIA 
AND SYRIAN-CONTROLLED AREAS OF LEBANON IF IT CHOSE TO DO 
SO. 
 
OTHER SYRIAN-SUPPORTED PALESTINIAN GROUPS 
 
SYRIA ALSO PROVIDES VARYING AMOUNTS OF SUPPORT TO OTHER 
RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUPS.  THESE INCLUDE:  SAIQA, WHICH 
IS UNDER TOTAL SYRIAN CONTROL; THE ABU MUSA GROUP, NOW 
ALMOST TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON DAMASCUS; THE POPULAR FRONT 
FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE--GENERAL COMMAND 
(PFLP-GC); AND THE MARXIST POPULAR FRONT FOR THE 
LIBERATION OF PALESTINE (PFLP), WHICH NOW MAINTAINS ITS 
PRINCIPAL BASE IN DAMASCUS. 
 
IN ALL, SYRIAN-SPONSORED GROUPS, INCLUDING THE ABU NIDAL 
ORGANIZATION, WERE LINKED TO ABOUT 30 TERRORIST ATTACKS 
DURING 1985, A QUARTER OF THEM IN GREECE ALONE.  THE ABU 
MUSA GROUP ANNOUNCED FROM DAMASCUS ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO BOMB AN EL AL AIRLINER, IN MADRID ON 
JUNE 26 OF THIS YEAR.  THE SUSPECT IN THAT ATTEMPT HAS 
ADMITTED BEING A MEMBER OF THE GROUP.  TWO WEEKS LATER, 
OTHER GROUPS SUPPORTED BY SYRIA, THE PFLP AND THE 
LEBANESE SYRIAN SOCIAL NATIONALIST PARTY, ATTEMPTED AN 
ATTACK ON AN ISRAELI RESORT TOWN ON JULY 10, 1986. 
 
SUPPORT FOR NON-PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS 
 
IN ADDITION TO THE RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUPS, A VARIETY 
OF OTHER TERRORISTS HAVE FACILITIES AND RECEIVED 
TERRORIST TRAINING IN SYRIA OR SYRIAN-CONTROLLED AREAS OF 
LEBANON:  THE JAPANESE RED ARMY, THE KURDISH LABOR PARTY, 
THE ARMENIAN SECRET ARMY FOR THE LIBERATION OF ARMENIA 
(ASALA), AND THE PAKISTANI AL ZULFIKAR.  IN ADDITION, THE 
LEBANESE ARMED REVOLUTIONARY FACTION (LARF) IS BASED IN 
THE LEBANESE VILLAGE OF QUBAYAT, WITHIN THE AREA OF 
SYRIAN CONTROL IN LEBANON. 
 
TO THESE GROUPS MUST BE ADDED THE INDIVIDUAL 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS WHO FREQUENT DAMASCUS.   BRUNO 
BREGUET, AN ASSOCIATE OF CARLOS, THE INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORIST, WAS ARRESTED IN PARIS IN FEBRUARY 1982 FOR 
TRANSPORTING ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES.  LATER RELEASED, HE WAS 
RECENTLY SIGHTED ON A FLIGHT TO DAMASCUS, MET ON ARRIVAL 
BY SYRIAN AUTHORITIES, AND ESCORTED THROUGH THE AIRPORT 
WITHOUT HAVING TO PASS THROUGH THE NORMAL CONTROLS. 
EVIDENCE EXISTS THAT FREDERIC ORIACH, A MILITANT MEMBER 
OF THE  FRENCH ACTION DIRECT, SPENT JULY AND AUGUST 1986 
IN DAMASCUS PURSUING IDEOLOGICAL AND MILITARY STUDIES. 
 
CASUALTIES AND CONTROL 
 
ATTACKS BY SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS SINCE 1983 HAVE KILLED 
OR WOUNDED NEARLY 500 PEOPLE. 
 
SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS HAVE ATTACKED U.S. FACILITIES IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST OVER 10 TIMES SINCE 1983.  IN JORDAN LAST 
YEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, THE SYRIAN-SPONSORED JORDANIAN PEOPLES 
REVOLUTIONARY PARTY ATTEMPTED TWO ANTI-U.S. ATTACKS. 
BOMBS WERE FOUND AT A USAID EMPLOYEE'S HOME AND AT THE 
AMERICAN CENTER FOR ORIENTAL STUDIES.  THESE OPERATIONS, 
AS WELL AS OTHERS AIMED AGAINST JORDANIAN TARGETS, HAVE 
HALTED SINCE THE SYRIAN-JORDANIAN RAPPROCHEMENT LATE LAST 
YEAR--UNDERSCORING SYRIA'S ABILITY, IF IT WISHES, TO 
CONTROL ITS SURROGATES' ACTIVITIES AND TO SEVERELY CURB 
THE CAPABILITY OF THOSE TO WHOM IT PROVIDED SAFE HAVEN 
AND SUPPORT. 
 
THIS HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY A TOP SYRIAN OFFICIAL WHO 
TRIED TO DISMISS, IN A WASHINGTON POST PRESS INTERV1EW 
THIS SEPTEMBER, EVIDENCE THAT ABU NIDAL'S GROUP WAS 
INVOLVED IN TERRORIST ATTACKS.  SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
FAROUK CHARAA SAID IN DISCUSSING THE ACTIONS OF THE ABU 
NIDAL GROUP:  "WHOEVER KNOWS MY GOVERNMENT MUST REALIZE 
THAT SUCH ATTACKS COULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT WITHOUT ITS 
AWARENESS."  (END TEXT OF FACT PAPER.)

CHRONOLOGY OF SELECTED TERRORIST INCIDENTS BY 
SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS:  1983-1986 
 
 THE FOLLOWING LIST OF TERRORIST INCIDENTS IS NOT 
INTENDED TO BE ALL-INCLUSIVE BUT IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF 
SYRIA'S INVOLVEMENT IN AND SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM AND 
TERRORIST GROUPS.  THE GROUPS CITED HERE HAVE LINKS WITH

        HASI, SAID HE PICKED UP THE BOMB AT THE SYRIAN 
        EMBASSY IN EAST BERLIN FROM A SYRIAN AIR FORCE 
        INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.  HASI IS A BROTHER OF

        COURT FOR THE ATTEMPTED BOMBING OF AN EL AL 
        AIRLINER.

        WARRANT ALSO WAS ISSUED FOR THE SYRIAN EMBASSY 
        SECOND SECRETARY, MOHAMMED DARWICHI, WHO WAS 
        ONE OF THE ORIGINAL DEFENDENTS AND LEFT 
        TURKEY.  THE INDICTMENT ALSO LINKED MEMBERS OF 
        THE GROUP WITH FOUR OTHER ACTIONS:  THE 
        SEPTEMBER 6, 1986 ATTACK ON AN ISTANBUL 
        SYNAGOGUE, WHICH KILLED 22 PERSONS; AN ATTEMPT

       SPANISH POLICE CARRIED A SYRIAN PASSPORT.  A 
       SPOKESMAN FOR THE ABU MUSA GROUP, WHICH IS 
       ALMOST TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON DAMASCUS, CLAIMED 
       RESPONSIBILITY FOR PLANTING THE BOMB, ALTHOUGH 
       THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT DENIED INVOLVEMENT. 
 
17 APRIL  LONDON.  EL AL SECURITY DISCOVERED A SYRIAN-MADE 
      BOMB IN THE LUGGAGE OF AN IRISH WOMAN AS SHE

      HINDAWI, GUILTY OF THE ATTEMPTED BOMBING, AND

      WOUNDING SOME 120 OTHERS.  (ALTHOUGH THESE 
      ATTACKS WERE COMMITTED UNDER LIBYAN SPONSORSHIP, 
      REPORTS ON THE ITALIAN INVESTIGATION INDICATE
