SUBJECT: PROTESTORS IN RUSSIAN FAR EAST DO NOT PUSH THE ENVELOPE 
 
¶1. (U) This weekend's protests in Primorye Kray's major cities, 
including Vladivostok, took on the more festive atmosphere of 
the first protests in December.  Members of the Communist party, 
TIGR, and trade union and other public organizations had 
balloons and banners on hand, but they did not block traffic as 
they had originally planned and there were no confrontations 
with militia.  The protests seem designed to keep the protestors 
organized and morale high rather than to serious challenge the 
government at this point. 
 
¶2. (U) According to the Interior Ministry only about 1,500 
protestors met on Sunday, March 15.  Press accounts put the 
number in Vladivostok alone at 1,000.  The militia effectively 
stymied the plan to block traffic on major roads, issuing 
citations for minor infractions to drivers who stopped their 
cars.  After some negotiation by TIGR leaders, the drivers were 
released on the condition that they not attend the protests. 
 
¶3. (U) Signs amongst the protestors played with the name "Putin" 
and "Liliputian," and a giant balloon bear, symbolizing United 
Russia, was released during the protest in Vladivostok.  United 
Russia officals declined to accept a note from the 
demonstrators.  Protestors called for Governor Darkin's 
resignation as well as a new federal government.  They also 
called for fair elections, a financial audit of United Russia, 
and an overhaul of federal economic policy. Protestors continue 
to voice complaints about car import tarrifs, high food and 
medicine costs, and high unemployment.
