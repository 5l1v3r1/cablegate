There is no deadline for ending of the Talks.

resolved at an early date to prevent them from

espionage sentence given to CASS sociologist Lu 
Jianhua or the house arrest of dissident Hu Jia. 
 
-- China "took note" of United States-India nuclear 
cooperation legislation in the United States. 
 
-- China opposes the "out-of-date" EU arms embargo. 
 
-- Chinese leaders will visit Japan next year, 
although there are no details about that trip or about 
Chinese participation in rescheduled ASEAN meetings. 
 
Six-Party Talks Underway 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. MFA Spokesperson Qin Gang announced in the regular 
December 19 press briefing that the heads of 
delegation of the Six-Party Talks discussed this 
morning how to finalize the September 2005 Joint 
Statement.  Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei stated 
China's position that parties must make realistic 
choices and define specific actions to take at the 
current stage.  Although differences were "visible and 
sharp," at the initial meeting, Qin said, all parties 
hope to find similarities and common positions in 
order to press ahead with denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula and to finalize the Joint Statement. 
There is no stated deadline for the Talks, Qin said, 
and any such deadline will be decided by consensus of 
all the parties. 
 
¶3. Qin gave no specifics in response to repeated 
questions about discussion of financial "sanctions" 
and the financial issues working group.  Measures 
taken in the Macao SAR will be handled in accordance 
with facts and legal requirements, he said.  China 
hopes the parties can settle the issue at an early 
date to prevent the issue from disrupting the Six- 
Party Talks.  Asked about the purpose of UNSCR 1718, 
Qin said that the resolution's goal is to solve the 
DPRK nuclear issue through consultation not sanctions. 
 
¶4. Asked about bilateral meetings in the Six-Party 
process, Qin said he had heard the United States and 
DPRK might meet bilaterally but had no information 
about the substance of such a meeting.  He confirmed 
that at least twelve bilateral meetings took place 
involving various parties since December 17. 
 
¶5. A reporter asked about reports that EAP Assistant 
Secretary Hill was disappointed with the lack of 
 
SIPDIS 
progress so far in the Talks.  Qin said the meetings 
have just begun and all participants should exert more 
patience.  The Talks are like a marathon that parties 
must run to build up patience and endurance, he said. 
 
Human Rights: 20-Year Sentence For Sociologist 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶6. Qin ducked a question by a Reuters' reporter about 
the espionage conviction of CASS Sociologist Lu 
Jianhua, who was reportedly sentenced to 20 years in 
prison.  He similarly had no information in response 
to a question asserting that dissident Hu Jia has been 
held in house arrest for five months.  Qin referred 
reporters to the Justice Ministry and said China is a 
country ruled by law that acts in accordance with 
rules and regulations. 
 
¶7. China has taken note that President Bush signed the 
United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation 
Act and believes that nuclear cooperation on the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy should be conducive to 
 
BEIJING 00024643  002 OF 002 
 
 
the maintenance of principles and efficacy of 
international nonproliferation mechanisms, Qin said 
when asked for a comment on the bill. 
 
¶8. China opposes the "out-of-date" European Union's 
arms embargo against China, Qin said in response to a 
question about the impact that the outgoing Finnish 
Presidency of the EU had on the arms embargo.  The 
purpose of China's opposition is not to buy weapons, 
but rather to have a relationship based on equality 
and mutual benefit.  China and the EU enjoy a 
strategic partnership.  The EU has expressed its 
commitment to lifting the ban, he said. 
 
Chinese Visits to Japan, ASEAN meetings 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. Chinese leaders have agreed to make high-level 
visits to Japan next year, but no specific dates or 
participants have been confirmed, Qin said.  China 
supports the Philippines' efforts to host the ASEAN 
summits, Qin said, but would not provide details about 
Premier Wen's travel except to say that the visit 
would be discussed through diplomatic channels.
