SUBJECT:  GOT Turns Down DVC Proposal; Suggests a TIFA 
Meeting Instead 
 
 
¶1. On May 20, the Embassy received a response to our 
diplomatic note proposing a digital video conference 
(DVC) between U.S. and Turkish experts on intellectual 
property issues.  Following the December 2003 Economic 
Partnership Commission meeting, the USG and GOT had 
agreed to expert-level meetings on this subject, but we 
proposed a DVC when it became apparent that relevant 
staff could not travel to Turkey.  The dipnote response 
suggests instead that a Trade and Investment Framework 
Agreement (TIFA) meeting during the fall.  Embassy 
endorses the concept of holding a TIFA, perhaps in 
conjunction with the next meeting of the EPC, and 
requests Department guidance on a response to the Turks 
on this.  We note that MFA U/S Ziyal may raise this with 
U/S Larson in the EPC followup telephone call scheduled 
for May 24. 
 
 
¶2. Begin Text Diplomatic Note 2004/CEGY/187022 
 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Turkey presents its compliments to the Embassy of the 
United States of America and acknowledging the receipt 
of the Latter's Note No: 455 dated 8 April 2003, has the 
honor to communicate the following: 
 
 
Regarding the discussion of areas concerning the 
implementation of the TRIPS Agreement in the context of 
2003 Economic Partnership Commission, the proposal of 
the Embassy to organize this discussion by means of a 
digital video conference on the premises of the Embassy, 
is considered to be inconvenient for the relevant 
Turkish authorities.  Taking into account the 
difficulties concerning the traveling arrangements of 
relevant U.S. Government personnel to Turkey as stated 
in the Embassy's note, the Ministry proposes that this 
discussion take place during the Trade and Investment 
Framework Agreement (TIFA) meeting which may be convened 
in September or October 2004. 
 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Turkey avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the 
Embassy of the United States of America the assurances 
of its highest consideration. 
 
 
Ankara, 17 May 2004.
