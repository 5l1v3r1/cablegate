REF: (A) STATE 128442 (B) TALLINN 00689 
 
(U) On August 8 we delivered reftel points (ref A) to Acting 
MFA Director General for Political Affairs, Arti Hilpus, and 
asked once more the possibility of Estonia contributing to 
any eventual international peacekeeping force in Lebanon. 
Hilpus reiterated that, as Estonia already has close to ten 
percent of its armed forces serving in foreign missions, it 
is unlikely that Estonia can contribute any troops for a 
mission in Lebanon.  In an August 9 meeting with Israeli 
Ambassador to Estonia, Shemi Tzur, Foreign Minister Urmas 
Paet publicly expressed his support for an international 
peace keeping force and that he did not rule out possible 
participation of Estonian soldiers at a later date.  In the 
meantime, the MFA has donated 500,000 EEK ($42,000) in 
humanitarian assistance for UN operations in Lebanon.  Also, 
if a ceasefire is brokered, Estonia has a rapid-reaction 
disaster-relief medical team that may be available, although 
no serious discussions have yet taken place in the MFA on 
deployment.  The GOE's preference is for a peacekeeping force 
sent under a concrete UN mandate.  However, given the fact 
that Estonia is not planning to contribute personnel, Hilpus 
said the GOE will defer to the preferences of the lead 
countries contributing to this force.
