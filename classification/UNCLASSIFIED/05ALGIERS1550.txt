In a condolence message sent to Egyptian President Hosni 
Moubarak July 23, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika condemned 
the July 23 attacks in Sharm El-Sheikh, which he described as 
a "barbaric act."  He expressed Algeria's solidarity with 
Egypt in his message:  "It is a painful tragedy which has 
befallen Egypt's security, people, and guests and killed 
innocent civilians, Egyptians, Arabs and foreigners.  In 
condemning this barbaric act, which does not value human life 
and does not give consideration to the minimum religious, 
moral and human values, we assure you of our true and sincere 
solidarity with you, and stand beside the Egyptian people at 
this painful time....  We reiterate our determination to 
continue the fight against terrorism and uproot it from our 
forgiving and moderate societies.  I would like on this 
terrible occasion to express on behalf of the Algerian people 
and myself our deepest condolences to the families of the 
innocent victims, praying for God to save Egypt from any 
harm."
