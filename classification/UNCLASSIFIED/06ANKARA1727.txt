The Turkish Foreign Ministry made the following announcement 
March 30 concerning the formation of a government in the

Begin Text: 
 
March 30, 2006 
 
The Palestine National Administration Government, which was 
established in accordance with the results of Palestine 
Legislative Council elections held on January 25, 2006, was 
given a vote of confidence by the Palestine Legislative 
Council on March 28, 2006. 
 
We desire that the new government be for the good of the 
Palestinian people. 
 
We hope that the Palestinian government will handle the 
urgent issues that are on the agenda with a responsible and 
constructive understanding and that violent acts, blood and 
tears in the region will end. 
 
At this stage, the international community should assume an 
unbiased approach, giving the new Palestinian government the 
opportunity to fulfill its obligations. 
 
Turkey, in this new period starting with the election of the 
Legislative Council in Palestine, sincerely wishes that an 
environment will be created which will provide the necessary 
conditions to accelerate reform and re-structuring efforts 
and invigorate the peace process.  Our country will do its 
share to contribute to this.
