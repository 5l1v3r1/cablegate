¶1. (U) Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) North America and Oceania 
Division Director General ZHENG Zeguang called the DCM September 5 
to inform us that the Government of the People's Republic of China 
has decided, as an expression of sympathy and support to the 
government and people of the United States, to provide a USD 100,000 
cash donation to the USG following the damage inflicted by Hurricane 
Gustav and to alleviate victims' suffering caused by the event. 
 
¶2. (U) Zheng separately said the Chinese Red Cross also has decided 
to donate USD 50,000 to the American Red Cross for Gustav relief 
efforts, as an expression of similar sentiments. 
 
¶3. (U) Zheng further stated that the gesture of these donations 
reflects genuine feelings of sympathy, and that it is done in the 
spirit of mutual support for our common effort to confront natural 
disasters. 
 
¶4. (U) According to Zheng, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) will 
handle the government-to-government transfer of funds.  Post is 
currently in contact with MOFCOM and will report any additional 
details related to this transaction. 
 
¶5. (U) NOTE:  Earlier in the week, Ambassador Randt sent to Foreign 
Minister YANG Jiechi a condolence letter expressing sympathy for the 
August 30 earthquake disaster near Panzhihua, along the 
Sichuan-Yunnan border.  In May and June of this year, the USG 
contributed a combined USD 4.9 million, and the American Red Cross 
donated USD 10 million toward relief efforts for the 7.9 magnitude 
May 12 Sichuan earthquake disaster (REFTELS).  In September 2005, in 
response to Hurricane Katrina, the Chinese government donated USD 
5.1 million in cash, plus tents, generators, and bedding, toward 
relief efforts.  Previous to that, the Chinese government had played 
an active role in relief efforts within the Asian region in the 
aftermath of the December 2004 tsunami; however, the Katrina 
donation marked the first time the GoC made a significant donation 
to the USG to assist with natural disaster relief.  END NOTE.
