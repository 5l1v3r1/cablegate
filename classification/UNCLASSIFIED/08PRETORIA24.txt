---------------------------- 
Credit Growth Remains Strong 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Despite numerous interest rate hikes since 2006, credit grew 
an annual rate of 22.6 percent in November.  The rate was down from 
23.39 percent in October, but was still higher than expected. 
Economists were divided over the implications.  Some said that 
continued robust spending would support the argument for another 
rate hike when the South African Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy 
Committee meets in late January.  However, one economist noted that 
the composition of credit is changing, with borrowing increasingly 
being used for investment rather than consumption.  He predicted 
that the South African Reserve Bank would leave interest rates 
unchanged.  (Business Day, December 31, 2007)

Foreign Capital Inflows Decline 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Net foreign purchases of South African shares and bonds fell 
to R81 billion ($11.6 billion) in 2007 from more than R100 billion 
($14.3 billion) in 2006.  While the amount is still substantial, and 
continues to fund the widening current account deficit estimated to 
be more than 7 percent of GDP for 2007, the slowdown highlights 
South Africa's exposure to swings in the mood of global investors. 
Analysts do not view the current account deficit as a problem 
provided capital inflows remain substantial.  However, a global 
credit crunch and resulting risk aversion may curb investors' 
appetites for emerging market assets.  In addition, a slowdown in 
South African economic growth due to the rising interest rates and 
political uncertainty may diminish the appeal of South African 
shares.  However, surging prices of commodities are likely to 
compensate.  (Business Day, January 4, 2008)

Gold Mining Shares Up 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Gold-mining shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) 
are reaping the benefits of high gold prices, with the gold-mining 
index jumping 6.07 percent on January 3.  Analysts noted, however, 
that gold now accounts for only 10-12 percent of South Africa's 
exports and only 4-5 percent of the labor force.  According to one 
economist at RBC Capital Markets, the increase in gold prices is 
"good news" for the economy but no reason to start "hammering the 
drums."  An economist at ABSA Capital said the rising trend in gold 
prices would strengthen the rand, encourage more investment in the 
mining sector, and help to finance South Africa's current account 
deficit by boosting mining shares on the JSE.  (Business Day,

------------------------------------ 
Student Test Scores Continue Decline 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) Poor secondary school test results indicate that South Africa 
is not producing the high-level skills the economy needs.  The pass 
rate, which has declined over the last four years, was 65.2 percent 
Qthis year compared to 66.5 percent last year.  The number of passing 
students eligible to go to a university fell 400 to 85,454, or only 
15 percent of those who took the exam.  More importantly, only 40 
percent of the 560,000 students who took the exam passed the math 
portion, and only 25,415 of those passed higher grade mathematics. 
Fewer than a third of the students passed science, with the number 
passing higher grade science dropping to 28,122 from 29,781 last 
year.  With higher grade math and science a requirement for 
university courses in subjects such as engineering, accounting, 
medicine and science, the limited pool of qualified students paints

a bleak picture of South Africa's long-term ability to meet its need 
for high-skilled professionals.  (Business Day Editorial, January 3,
