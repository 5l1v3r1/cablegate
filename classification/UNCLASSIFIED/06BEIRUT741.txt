CAMPAIGN 
 
 
¶1.  On March 8, the Lebanese Industrialists Association (LIA) 
in conjunction with Industry Minister Pierre Gemayel launched 
a campaign to promote Lebanese industry.  Bumper stickers, 
billboards and a clever ad campaign aimed at Lebanese youth 
will send this simple message to the Lebanese:  "Love 
Lebanon.  Love its industry."  Gemayel told the press, "The 
Lebanese should be proud of local industry which is on the 
same par with European and American counterparts."  Fadi 
Abboud, the President of LIA, told the press that promoting 
Lebanese industry was "crucial" because Lebanon's economic 
survival "depends on more job opportunities." 
 
¶2.  During a March 9 meeting, Abboud told Econoff that 
Lebanese industry has an "historical problem" of being seen 
as inferior to European and American industry.  He said that 
LIA is spending USD one million on a media campaign directed 
by advertising agency IMPACT/BBDO to help change perceptions. 
 Abboud would like to see more GOL support of Lebanese 
industry, particularly in helping to make exporting easier. 
Despite exports that increased to USD 1.88 billion in 2005, 
Lebanon's imports remain disproportionately higher at nearly 
USD 9.34 billion.  Abboud cited high energy costs and social 
security costs as two production costs that are hurting 
Lebanese producers.  Abboud told Econoff that unfair 
non-tariff barriers had hurt Lebanese industry in trade 
accords with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Jordan.  Abboud 
said that Economy Minister Haddad's November 2005 promise "to 
halve the costs of exporting" was not working, as indirect 
shipping and transport fees paid towards a corrupt 
bureaucracy made Lebanese products uncompetitive when they 
left Lebanese ports.
