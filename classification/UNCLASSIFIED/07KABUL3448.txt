SUBJECT: SPECIAL MEDIA REACTION: SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF U.S. INVASION 
OF AFGHANISTAN 
 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: Editorialists in all major Kabul dailies used the sixth 
anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan to measure the 
progress their country has made, and, despite improvements, all 
found the progress wanting. A resurgent Taliban, government 
corruption, ineptitude of the Afghan security forces and continued 
meddling by Afghanistan's neighbors were factors cited in slowing 
Afghanistan's progress and increasing instability. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. An unsigned editorial in the Oct. 8 edition of The Daily 
Afghanistan, an independent daily, read: "In the last six years, the 
transition in the country has been an exceptional and outstanding 
achievement. What is more important than these achievements is 
ability to maintain them, which is the responsibility of Afghanistan 
and of the international community. But after the presence of almost 
40,000 foreign troops over the last six years, Afghanistan is still 
under threat of terrorists, which is a mystery that needs to be 
solved. 
 
"After six years, people were expecting to achieve peace, 
development, prosperity and some significant changes in the areas of 
the economy, reconstruction, security and national and international 
relations. Unfortunately, it seems like Afghanistan is slowly moving 
towards those dark days that we had experienced six years ago." 
 
¶3. An unsigned editorial in the Oct. 8 edition of Cheragh, an 
independent daily, read: "The presence of the U.S.-led Coalition 
Forces in Afghanistan is entering the seventh year. While the people 
of Afghanistan are still expecting peace and security, terrorist 
camps are not shattered, but expanded. Drug production and 
trafficking is not prevented, but increased beyond the limits, and 
poverty and corruption in government offices remain untold stories 
during the presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan." 
 
¶4. An unsigned editorial in Anis, an independent daily, on Oct. 8, 
read: "The international community mistakenly thought that the 
Taliban disappeared from the scene after collapse the collapse of 
their regime. Nevertheless, they have been waiting in their former 
hideouts looking for an appropriate time to reappear, and the 
international community and the Afghan government's weakness and 
lack of decisiveness has now paved the way for them to arise and 
become the biggest obstacle. 
 
"The United States has made decisions about Afghanistan based on 
Pakistan's advice, and has judged Afghanistan from Pakistan's 
prospective, but has never thought of eliminating the roots of 
terrorism existing in that country. Now the remainders of the 
terrorists and the Taliban are gathering with the support of 
neighboring countries and they are directly interfering in 
Afghanistan, and their only aim is the collapse of the government. 
People are losing the hope for a safe and bright future day by day. 
The international community, especially the United States, should 
prove their promises of commitments towards Afghanistan by 
eliminating these obstacles preventing Afghans from stepping out on 
the road towards peace, stability and prosperity, and those promises 
should not fade away day by day." 
 
¶5. An unsigned editorial in the Oct. 8, edition of Weesa, an 
independent daily, read: "There is no question that today 
Afghanistan cannot be compared with the last six years, and 
politically, Afghanistan has a place in every political organization 
and international conference in the world. Afghanistan was not like 
today six years back. Today, we have an elected President, a 
government and a parliament, and our country is optimistic about its 
future. 
 
"In the construction area, a considerable amount of work has been 
achieved but above all, our nation's hopes and our people's optimism 
never came true. If the six years presence of the international 
community in Afghanistan was effective, we would have never seen in 
Kabul city in one week, three suicide bomb blasts that made tens of 
homes mourn. Now, it is important to do what has not been done yet, 
and to not do what causes Afghanistan and the international 
community many losses." 
 
¶6. An unsigned editorial in the Oct. 8 edition of Islah independent 
 
KABUL 00003448  002 OF 002 
 
 
daily read, "Six years after the Taliban regime's collapse, we now 
hear that they are back in action with the support of neighboring 
countries. The lack of coordination between Afghan security forces 
and NATO, and slow training of the Ministry of Interior and Defense 
are also considered factors which are facilitating opportunities for 
the Taliban to grow stronger. If the international community can 
eliminate the foreign supporters of the Taliban and al-Qaeda 
network, and in the meantime the ANA (Afghan National Army) and ANP 
(Afghan National Police) become capable of combat with these groups, 
then we can expect some positive outcomes during the seventh year of 
U.S. invasion on Afghanistan.
