¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  After more than two years of proceedings, on July 
15 the Fifth Senate at the Higher Regional Court in Stuttgart 
announced guilty verdicts for all three defendants in the in the 
Ansar-al Islam trial.  Ata Abdoulaziz Rashid received a ten years 
sentence, Mazen al-Hussein seven and a half years and Rafik Mohamad 
Yousef eight years.  The court found the three men guilty of 
membership in a foreign terrorist organization as well as attempted 
murder.  The sentences were less than the eleven years for Rashid 
and eight years and nine months for Al-Hussein and Yousef requested 
by the prosecutor.  The defense announced its intention to appeal. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
GUILTY VERDICTS FOR ALL THREE DEFENDANTS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.   Two years after the beginning of the Ansar-al Islam trial at 
the Higher Regional Court in Stuttgart in June 2006, the presiding 
judge of the Fifth Senate, Christine Rebsam-Bender, announced the 
guilty verdicts on July 15.  The five judges of the Fifth Senate 
found Ata Abdoulaziz Rashid (34), Mazen al-Hussein (27) and Rafik 
Mohamad Yousef (33) guilty of planning to assassinate Iraqi Prime 
Minister Allawi on his December 3, 2004 visit to Germany and of 
belonging to the terrorist organization Ansar al-Islam (a federal 
offense since 2002).  The three Iraqi men have been in custody since 
December 3, 2004. 
 
¶3.  In the ruling, Rebsam-Bender argued that Ansar-al Islam is one 
of the most dangerous terror organizations in Iraq and that Rashid 
had been the leader of the group in Germany.  Although the sentences 
were less than Prosecutor Silke Ritzert had called for, she 
described the verdict as "very satisfying."  The defense immediately 
announced it would appeal the verdict to the Federal Criminal Court 
(Bundesgerichtshof) in Karlsruhe, Germany's highest legal authority. 
 
 
¶4.  Rashid's attorney Roland Kugler asserted that the court had 
simply relied on U.S. sources for information about Ansar al-Islam 
and had accepted the accusations of the prosecutors prima facie. 
The attorneys for Rashid and Hussein also argued that their clients 
were not terrorists, but members of Iraqi resistance against an 
illegal war.  (Note: Rafik defended himself after firing his 
attorneys.  End Note.) 
 
A LONG TRIAL COMES TO AN END 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5.  The trial ran for over two years due to numerous motions filed 
by the defense, which had little chance of success but slowed the 
proceedings.  The defendants at times disrupted the proceedings with 
antics, on one occasion destroying a microphone, and often yelling 
at and insulting the judges.  In late June 2008, the court ruled 
that it would accept no further motions, saying they were a 
deliberate strategy to slow down the trial. 
 
¶6.  The prosecution also expressed doubt that any of the defendants 
would qualify for early release on grounds of good behavior.  Two 
letters from Rafik to fellow prison inmate Fritz Gelowicz, the 
alleged head of the "Sauerlandgroup" arrested in September 2007, 
were recently intercepted in the prison.  In the letters Rafik 
expressed his admiration for Gelowicz and offered to join him in 
Jihad. 
 
¶7.  COMMENT:  The verdict brings to an end a long trial that was 
lengthened by the tactics and disruptions of the defendants. 
Throughout the trial, the court moved cautiously in response to the 
defendants' actions in order to prevent a mistrial.  While the 
appeal will go forward, the case against the defendants appears 
strong.  END COMMENT.
