AMENDMENTS FORWARD 
 
REF: ANKARA 1083 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (U) Turkey's parliament approved two constitutional 
amendment packages on May 10, before adjourning until May 15. 
 
¶2. (U) By a vote of 429 to 12, MPs approved an amendment to 
list independent candidates on the main ballot instead of 
separate slips, as in previous elections.  The measure is 
widely seen as a hurdle for pro-Kurdish Democratic Turkey 
Party (DTP) candidates, who often run as independents.  Their 
supporters, many of whom are illiterate or not fluent in 
Turkish, may find it more difficult to identify their 
candidate's name on the main ballot.  President Sezer is 
expected to approve the amendment.  The ruling Justice and 
Development Party (AKP) shelved a companion amendment to 
lower the age for parliamentary candidates from 30 to 25 for 
technical reasons, although PM Erdogan announced the party 
will run 25-29 year old candidates and let the Supreme 
Election Board (SEB) determine their eligibility. 
 
¶3. (U) Deputies adopted a second amendment package to hold 
direct presidential elections and allow Turkey's president to 
be elected for two 5-year terms rather than one 7-year term. 
The proposal is based on France's two-round election system, 
If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the votes in 
the first round, the two top names will compete in a second 
round.  MPs approved the measures by a vote of 370 to 1. 
President Sezer is likely to veto the changes.  If parliament 
approves the package again, Sezer may submit it to 
referendum, where it would require approval of more than half 
of the valid votes cast.
