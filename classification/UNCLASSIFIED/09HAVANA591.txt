the migrant.  USINT officer briefed the returnees 
and provided standard information packets on legal

that USINT officers would attempt to contact them 
in the next several months to assess their well 
being, including visiting some Havana-based 
returnees in their homes.  Returnees were also 
advised that they could meet with a U.S. official 
at the Refugee Annex Fridays 10 am to discuss 
specific claims of harm, including retaliatory 
acts such as being unjustly dismissed from 
one's job, being frequently detained by police, 
or being the target of public acts of repudiation.
