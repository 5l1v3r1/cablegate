¶1. (U) The following statement on Afghanistan was issued 
following the December 4 meeting in Brussels of Foreign 
Ministers from countries participating in the NATO-led 
International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan: 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
 
Statement on Afghanistan by Ministers of Foreign Affairs of 
Nations participating in the International Security 
Assistance Force (ISAF) 
 
 
¶1. The future of Afghanistan and the stability of the region 
are directly linked to the security of our own countries, our 
own citizens and the wider international community; 
Afghanistan must never again become a safe haven for 
terrorism. For this clear reason, and to contribute to a 
better future for the Afghan people, today we - the Foreign 
Ministers of the 43 countries participating, at the request 
of the Afghan government, in the UN-mandated NATO-led ISAF 
operation - reconfirm the commitment of ISAF nations to help 
build lasting security and stability in Afghanistan, which 
remains the Alliance's key priority. 
 
¶2. We recognise the urgency of the challenge and we welcome 
the opportunity to work with the new Afghan government. We 
will therefore accelerate our efforts in support of the 
Afghan people and government. Our goal is to help Afghans to 
take over full responsibility and ownership as soon as 
possible for the security of their own country. Increasing 
Afghanistan's lead role across the board remains our primary 
objective. 
 
¶3. The past months have been particularly challenging. Afghan 
and ISAF forces alike, have suffered significant numbers of 
casualties. The Afghan people have also suffered great loss. 
We pay tribute to every sacrifice made and extend our 
condolences. We remain convinced that this mission is 
essential, and that our overall strategy, agreed at the 
Bucharest Summit, is the right one. To implement our strategy 
as effectively as possible and in the light of changing 
circumstances on the ground, we have agreed to make changes 
to our approach as set out below. As part of this, the ISAF 
operation will have, as a priority, the protection of the 
Afghan people, building Afghan security capacity and 
facilitating governance and development. 
 
¶4. The transition to Afghan lead on security is an objective 
we share with the Afghan government. We will urgently step up 
our efforts to empower the Afghan authorities and help them 
take over further security responsibilities. The transfer of 
lead security responsibility in Kabul was a first step and 
further transfers will happen as conditions across the 
country allow. We are therefore investing more in training, 
equipping and sustaining the Afghan National Security Forces, 
through the NATO Training Mission, to build Afghan capacity. 
Our mission will be accomplished when Afghan forces can 
secure their own country; the Training Mission and donations 
to the Afghan National Army Trust Fund will help bring that 
day closer. 
 
¶5. We endorse the underlying thrust of the assessment made by 
General McChrystal in August on how best to deliver our 
 
USNATO 00000567  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
strategy in Afghanistan. We strongly welcome President 
Obama's announcement that the United States will provide 
substantial additional troops and resources for this purpose. 
We also welcome the additional contributions announced 
recently and the fact that many other ISAF nations are, or 
will be increasing their military and civilian contributions 
in Afghanistan. All this reflects our determination and 
commitment to provide the resources essential for the success 
of the ISAF mission. 
 
¶6. Military forces alone, however, are not sufficient to 
ensure success. Security, governance and development must go 
hand in hand and require ever greater efforts to deliver a 
comprehensive approach under UNAMA leadership. We continue to 
support UNAMA in this regard. Strong action from the United 
Nations, the European Union, and many other organisations is 
absolutely essential to a successful international civilian 
effort. We, as nations, recognise the need to provide 
additional civilian resources and to help develop the Afghan 
government's capacity to govern at the national, provincial 
and district levels, to provide basic services and spur 
economic development. In support of the last point, NATO and 
ISAF should seek to maximise, to the extent possible, the 
positive economic impact of their presence in Afghanistan. 
 
¶7. We welcome the goals set out by President Karzai in his 
inaugural speech. We share his emphasis on improving 
governance, fighting corruption, working towards 
reintegration and reconciliation, strengthening the rule of 
law, protecting human rights, expanding regional cooperation, 
and laying out a goal for Afghanistan to have the lead in 
security operations. We agree that the implementation of 
these commitments will be central to making progress. We 
encourage the new government to deliver rapid and tangible 
results in this regard. 
 
¶8. We have agreed to support the Afghan authorities on 
reintegration issues and stand ready to contribute to a 
process of reconciliation. Both these processes must be 
Afghan-led and owned. 
 
¶9. We look forward to a sequence of conferences bringing 
together the Afghan government and the international 
community. These conferences should contribute to enhanced 
efforts in Afghanistan, set clear, viable and realistic 
benchmarks for progress and underscore the long-term 
commitment from the international community to help build 
security and stability in the country, to the benefit of us 
all. 
 
¶10. We reiterate the need for all of Afghanistan's neighbours 
to support the international efforts in the country, which 
are also in their security interests. Enhancing political 
dialogue and deepening our cooperation with Pakistan, in 
particular, will be a priority. We welcome existing efforts 
that contribute to regional cooperation in this regard. 
 
¶11. We, the nations participating in ISAF, will continue to 
work closely together on all matters related to the mission, 
its ongoing adaptation to the evolving situation on the 
ground and its relationship with the wider international 
effort in Afghanistan.
