SUBJECT: SAG NOTES TO SECSTATE REQUESTING SUPPORT FOR MINTY 
AT IAEA 
 
¶1.  On May 26, Post received two official letters from the 
former and the current Ministers of the Department of Foreign 
Affairs (newly renamed "Department of International Relations 
and Cooperation"), urging Secretary Clinton to support the 
candidacy of Ambassador Abdul Samad Minty for the position of 
Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA).  The texts of these letters are below. 
 
¶2.  The letter from Foreign Minister Dlamini Zuma under the 
previous Motlanthe administration follows here. 
 
 
"5 May 2009 
 
 
Your Excellency 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of the 
decision by the South African Government to re-nominate 
Ambassador Abdul Samad Minty for the position of 
Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA). 
 
It is my firm belief that Ambassador Minty will continue to 
promote the critical role the agency must play in promoting 
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and that he will continue 
to strengthen the capacity of the IAEA to implement its 
statutory mandate. 
 
Ambassador Minty is highly respected for his integrity and 
even-handedness in promoting multilateralism.  We are 
confident that he has the necessary knowledge and experience 
to guide the IAEA, through a consensual approach, in finding 
creative solutions to deal with the challenges arising from 
the dynamic environment in which the Agency operates. 
 
The South African Government would highly appreciate the 
support of the Government of the United States of America for 
the candidature of Ambassador Minty during the upcoming 
selection process for the position of Director-General of the 
IAEA. 
 
Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma" 
 
 
¶3.  The letter from the present Minister of International 
Relations and Cooperation, Maite E. Nkoana-Mashabane, is 
below. 
 
 
"14 May 2009 
 
Your Excellency 
 
My predecessor, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma wrote to you on 5 
May 2009 to inform you of the decision by the South African 
Government to re-nominate Ambassador Abdul Samad Minty for 
the position of Director-General of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the 
importance we attach to this position and our conviction that 
Ambassador Minty has the necessary skills and experience to 
manage and guide the IAEA in fulfilling the obligations set 
out in the Agency's statute. 
 
I look forward to building a working relationship with you 
and to continue expanding the relations between our two 
countries. 
 
Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
Ms. Maite E. Nkoana-Mashabane"
