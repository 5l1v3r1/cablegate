¶1.  Paragraph 2 of reftel describes a December 26, 2007 
incident in which a Cuban emigre threw a rock through a glass 
door at the Cuban Mission and was subsequently arrested by 
the New York Police Department.  USUN has received a 
diplomatic note dated January 7, 2008 (text follows in 
paragraph 2 below) protesting the incident.  The note 
stresses that the host country will be held responsible for 
the December 10 and December 26 incidents and any others that 
may follow.  The Cuban Mission has called for an emergency 
meeting of the UN Committee on Relations with the Host 
Country to discuss the recent incidents and the City of New 
York's decision to discontinue round the clock police 
protection at the Cuban Mission.  USUN would appreciate 
learning of any update in Department's plans to engage New 
York City officials regarding possible re-establishment of 
police coverage of the Cuban Mission. 
 
¶2.  BEGIN TEXT OF CUBAN NOTE OF 1/7/08:  Complimentary 
salutation...and has the honor to inform that on last 26 
December 2007 an unidentified person threw a stone against 
one of the glass doors of the building where the Mission of 
Cuba to the United Nations is located, shattering it. 
 
The Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations 
immediately phoned the Liaison of the Diplomatic Security 
Service of the Department of State and the New York Police 
Department to inform about this action and noticed that this 
person remained standing in the doorway of the Mission 
shouting insults and insisting that he would not leave that 
place until the police came for him.  Later the police 
arrived and took him to the police station. 
 
The Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations considers 
that the unilateral removal of police protection of the Cuban 
Mission to the United Nations brings about the commission of 
actions like this. 
 
The Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations wishes to 
recall its note verbale NV. 6185, 27 November 2007, in which 
the Mission of Cuba to the United Nations conveyed its 
concern at the measure taken by the Diplomatic Security 
Service and the New York Police Department with the removal 
of police protection of the Cuban Mission to the United 
Nations and stressed the responsibility, regarding the 
security of this Mission, that the United States authorities 
incur in with this new measure taken.
