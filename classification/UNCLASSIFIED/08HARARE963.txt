----------------------------- 
On the Political/Social Front 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Deadlocked, But SADC-Hosted Talks to Resume...  The SADC 
Troika-Angola, Mozambique, and Swaziland-will attempt to mediate a 
resolution to the stalled power-sharing negotiations in Harare on 
October 27.  Insiders to the negotiations are not optimistic 
progress will be made, or even in the event an agreement is reached, 
that ZANU-PF would honor it.  See Harare 959 and Harare 960. 
 
¶4.  No Progress Says Tsvangirai...  MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai 
addressed the assembled OECD heads of mission on October 22 and 
explained that the negotiations had made no progress and would 
require SADC and AU mediation.  Despite threats to boycott over 
frustration at not yet having received his passport, Tsvangirai is 
expected to participate in Troika discussions on the October 27. 
Newly-appointed South African president Motlanthe is also expected 
to be present.  See Harare 955. 
 
¶5.  Lack of Passport Paper to Blame...  Mugabe spokesperson George 
Charamba blamed Western sanctions for a lack of passport paper that 
led to the Registrar General's inability to issue Tsvangirai a new 
passport.  Tsvangirai has been waiting since August to get his 
passport renewed, and chose not to attend a SADC Troika meeting in 
Swaziland on Monday to highlight the issue. 
 
¶6.  Botswana Calls for New Elections... The Government of Botswana 
 
HARARE 00000963  002 OF 003 
 
 
issued a press release on October 20 criticizing ZANU-PF and 
supporting Tsvangirai's efforts to achieve a power-sharing 
settlement.  In the event of continued deadlock, Botswana called for 
a new presidential election to determine Zimbabwe's political 
future. 
 
¶7.  Zimbabwean Elephants Get a Reprieve...  The Zimbabwean Parks and 
Wildlife Authority (Parks) has agreed, under pressure from 
photographic tour operators, to suspend the issuance of hundreds of 
questionable elephant hunting permits.  The Parks program had been 
abused as hunters and Parks' staff killed animals larger than 
allowed or outside the program parameters and profited from the meat 
and ivory.  The "quiet diplomacy" effort proved successful in part 
because the issue was kept out of the media.  See Harare 956. 
 
¶8.  Zimbabwean Journalist Wins German Award...  Trevor Ncube, 
Zimbabwean journalist and publisher of Zimbabwe independent 
newspapers The Zimbabwe Independent and The Standard, won Germany's 
Africa Award for his tireless engagement on behalf of freedom and 
human rights in Zimbabwe and Africa.  The award was presented by the 
president of the European Parliament. 
 
---------------------------------- 
On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  RBZ's Profligacy on Patronage Vehicles...  A vehicle importer 
divulged to us how the RBZ was using the parallel market to finance 
the importation of millions of U.S. dollars worth of popular pickup 
trucks and 4x4s for patronage purposes. See Harare 947. 
 
¶10.  The ZSE Runs Amok As Currency Grows Worthless...  As economic 
fundamentals continue to weaken and negative real returns on the 
money market deepen, the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) and fixed 
properties have become the only reasonable hedges against exploding 
inflation.  All ZSE counters witnessed record-breaking increases in 
prices in recent weeks.  The industrial and mining indices have 
risen by 415 trillion percent and 291 trillion percent respectively 
since January.  On a related note, the check exchange rate plummeted 
further in line with movement in the Old Mutual Implied exchange 
rate.  The check rate fell from Z$40 million:US$1 on October 17 to 
Z$2 billion:US$1 a week later, reflecting, in the main, the 
continued shortage of foreign exchange. 
 
¶11.  Fuel Shortages Force Cuts in Bus Services...  A cutback in 
subsidized fuel from the government-owned National Oil Company of 
Zimbabwe (NOCZIM) due to a crippling lack of foreign exchange has 
left Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (ZUPCO) operating at 20 
percent capacity.  The public bus company can no longer maintain 
full service on all its routes due to its low subsidized fares. 
 
¶12.  Zimbabwe Chamber of Commerce Issues Manifesto...  The ZNCC 
issued a business manifesto this week that calls for more policy 
consultation between government and business; depoliticization and 
demilitarization of public institutions; concentration on 
engineering, import substitution and the full utilization of 
strategic resources; and a policy environment that encourages 
private public partnerships in construction and in infrastructure 
maintenance. 
 
¶13.  Another Victim of Price Controls...  Food giant Cairns released 
a deplorable set of results to the end of August.  Capacity 
utilization fell from 40% in 2007 to 14% this reporting year, and 
volume fell 53% under the scourge of price controls. 
 
¶14.  Good Start to Rainy Season...  The clouds broke this week and 
much of the country enjoyed a thunderous start to the rainy season. 
Unfortunately, neither maize seed nor fertilizer is readily

available on the markets.
