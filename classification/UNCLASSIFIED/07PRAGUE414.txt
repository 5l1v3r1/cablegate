In response to reftel B demarche, Czech MFA Iraq Desk Officer 
Sylvia Sulaimanova informed  that the GOCR has not yet 
reached a final decision regarding participation at the May 3 
International Compact with Iraq (ICI) meeting in Egypt. 
Nonetheless, she anticipates the Czech Republic will likely 
be represented by the Czech Ambassador to Egypt Miroslav 
Stasek, who, until recently, was the Director of the MFA 
Middle East and Africa Department.  Sulaimanova said that 
bilateral support for Iraq (ref C) is the main channel of 
Czech support for Iraq.  At the multilateral level, the GOCR 
announced in mid-March a CZK 3 million (USD 150,000) 
contribution to the UNHRC for Iraqi refugees.
