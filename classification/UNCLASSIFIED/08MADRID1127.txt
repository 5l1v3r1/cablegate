¶1. (U) Econoff passed on reftel requests, providing the GOS 
the opportunity to pursue an investigation as provided 
under Article 12 of the Convention on International Civil 
Aviation, (the "Chicago Convention") on reftel Spanish 
nationals who allegedly violated U.S. FAA regulations. 
Santiago Quiros Babillo, area officer at the Ministry of 
Infrastructure's Civil Aviation Directorate, advised 
Econoff October 22 that Spanish law does not conform to 
Article 12 of the Chicago Convention. 
 
¶2. (U) Quiros Babillo said that Spanish Law 21/2003 
(article 2) as well as Spanish Law 48/1960 (articles 6,7, 
and 8) prohibited the Government of Spain from undertaking 
an investigation or proceedings on violations committed in 
air space outside of Spain.  Quiros Babillo thanked Econoff 
for the information, but noted that the Civil Aviation 
Directorate would not be able to follow up on reftel or 
future 
such cases.
