¶1.  Reftel A listed names, years of birth, and ministries of 
Somaliland participants in ATA 7031, Integrating Counter Terrorism 
Strategies at the National Level, March 16 - April 3, 2009 in Addis 
Ababa, Ethiopia (as announced in reftel B).  At post's encouragement 
and Government of Somaliland's agreement, Somaliland has reduced the 
number of coast guard officers and increased the number of police 
officers, while still maintaining 22 participants.  Post believes 
increased police participation was essential to the training's 
success and the potential to meet the course's objective of standing 
up a counter-terrorism center. 
 
¶2.  We hereby submit the new, amended list of participants.  Post 
again requests Department's assistance in screening these members of 
the Somaliland interior ministry, immigration, customs, police 
forces and coast guard nominated to participate in the course. 
Pursuant to the Leahy Act and Foreign Assistance Act, Post is 
reviewing its files for gross violations of human rights for the 
individuals listed in paragraph 3.  In the meantime, post has 
requested more complete biographic information, including place of 
birth, and day and month of birth.  Note:  Somalis sometimes do not 
know their month and day of birth. End Note.
