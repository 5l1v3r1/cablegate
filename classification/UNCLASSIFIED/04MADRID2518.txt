SUBJECT: HAITI DEMARCHE FOR BUDGET SUPPORT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 132852 
 
We delivered demarche June 24 to high level contacts at the 
Spanish Agency for International Development.  We received a 
response July 2 after repeated requests from Technical 
Counselor Jose Maria Berzosa of the Subdirectorate for 
Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.  Berzosa noted 
that emergency aid might be a possibility, but specifics have 
not been announced.  The Spanish government is considering 
increased assistance to Haiti, and the Agency plans to 
reactivate its office in Haiti in the near future.
