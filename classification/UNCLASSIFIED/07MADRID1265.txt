¶1. (U) SUMMARY.  On June 24, a car bomb attack killed six and 
wounded two Spanish soldiers serving in the UNIFIL mission in 
southern Lebanon.  Spain has 1100 troops in UNIFIL and leads 
a multi-national brigade.  Hizballah condemned the attack. 
Suspicion for the attack centers on Fatah al Islam, linked to 
Al Qaeda.  Defense Minister Alonso and Foreign Minister 
Moratinos have both said publicly that Spanish troops will 
continue to serve in Lebanon.  While the opposition Popular 
Party (PP) has attacked the GOS for misleading Spaniards 
about the risks faced in the mission, all parties except the 
minor Galician National Block continue to support Spanish 
participation in UNIFIL. Local press covered the Secretary 
and the Ambassador's expressions of condolence, and the 
Ambassador attended the official funeral on June 26. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) According to Alonso's statements, at approximately 6 
pm local time on June 24, a Renault packed with 50-70 kg of 
explosives exploded alongside one of two armored personnel 
carriers patrolling near Jiam, near the Israel-Lebanon 
border.  The car bomb killed six Spanish soldiers (three of 
whom were Colombian nationals) and injured two others. 
Alonso flew to Lebanon on the evening of June 24.  After the 
remains were identified, he accompanied them back to Madrid 
on the evening of June 25.  The Prince of Asturias, 
accompanied by President Zapatero and Alonso, presided over 
an official funeral in Madrid on June 26, which the 
Ambassador attended. 
 
¶3. (U) Alonso has not publicly placed blame for the attack, 
but he noted that Hizballah had issued a communique 
condemning the attack.  He said that it was carried out by 
people who "are attempting to destabilize southern Lebanon 
and question the mission of UNIFIL."  Alonso and Director 
General of the National Police and Guardia Civil Joan 
Mesquida have spoken to Lebanese PM Siniora about the 
importance of identifying the attackers.  Suspicion centers 
on Fatah al Islam.  PP Parliamentary Spokesman for Foreign 
Affairs Gustavo de Aristegui expressed skepticism that 
Hezbollah was unaware of planning for the attack.  De 
Aristegui said June 25 in a radio interview that Lebanese 
leaders had told him that the attack was a "clear message" 
from regional powers to UNIFIL.  The Iranian government 
announced it would cooperate in the investigation of the 
attack at Spain,s request.  According to media reports, 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki spoke with Moratinos by 
phone June 25.  Apparently Mottaki called Moratinos to 
express his condolences, and Moratinos then asked for Iran,s 
assistance.  Mottaki ordered Iran,s ambassador in Beirut to 
coordinate with the Spaish Embassy there. 
 
¶4. (U) Alonso and FM Moratinos (who is in China with the 
King) have publicly affirmed that Spain troops will remain 
committed to the UNIFIL mission.  All parties except the 
minor Galician National Block continue to support Spanish 
participation in UNIFIL.  The PP has challenged the GOS's 
characterization of Spain's participation in UNIFIL, asking 
that Zapatero admit that he has sent Spanish troops to a war 
zone, rather than "trying to hide it by pretending pacifism." 
 The PP and leftist Izquerida Unida have asked the GOS to 
increase protective measures for Spanish troops where 
possible.  Alonso has acknowledged that the Spanish military 
had not yet installed frequency inhibitors on its vehicles in 
Lebanon, though since last November it had begun to do so for 
vehicles used in overseas missions.  The military initially 
focused the program in Afghanistan where it judged the threat 
higher.  Alonso has ordered the installation program to be 
accelerated. 
 
¶5. (U) Local press carried Secretary Rice,s expressions of 
condolence and remarks on the attack from her press 
conference in Paris with French FM Kouchner on June 24. 
Ambassador Aguirre opened the EU-US Conference on Energy and 
Technology on June 25 by expressing his condolences for the 
death of the six soldiers.  The conference was attended by 
Minister of Industry, Tourism, and Commerce Joan Clos.  The 
Ambassador also called Spanish Chief of Defense General Sanz 
to offer sympathy.  The Community of Madrid has declared two 
days of mourning.  The Embassy lowered its flag to half-mast 
for one day as a sign of respect. 
 
¶6. (U) Alonso was scheduled to testify to the Parliamentary 
Defense Commission on Tuesday, June 26 regarding Spain's plan 
to send two military training teams to Afghanistan, but this 
testimony has been postponed.  He will appear in Parliament 
soon to explain the circumstances of the deaths in Lebanon.
