"Appreciation" for U.S. Opposition to UN Referendum 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2. At the September 26 regular Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) 
press briefing, spokesman Li Weiyi expressed deep 
appreciation for U.S. opposition, which Washington has stated 
"many times," to Taiwan's attempts to "breach" the 
cross-Strait status quo, enter the UN under the name "Taiwan" 
and holding a referendum on UN membership.  In response to a 
question regarding a leader "friendly" to Taiwan supposedly 
referring to the "Republic of Taiwan" as an independent 
country at the UN, Li said China "opposes and condemns" such 
language, which violates the international community's "one 
China" policy, the UN Charter and UNGA Resolution 2578. 
 
Taiwan Missile Squadron in Matsu 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3. "Don't play with fire, because if you play with fire you 
will get burned," said Li when asked about reports of Taiwan 
military plans to establish a missile squadron on Matsu and 
secretly manufacture surface-to-surface missiles.

17th Party Congress to Guide Taiwan Work 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Asked if policy toward Taiwan would change at next month's 
17th Party Congress, the spokesman said the CCP will address 
the Taiwan situation and developing trends of Taiwan in 
recent years to determine the guiding ideology, general 
requirements and major tasks for Taiwan work in the future. 
He added that guiding and promoting Taiwan work and advancing 
the development of cross-Strait relations and the peaceful 
reunification process are of "grand significance." 
 
Olympic Torch Will Not Pass Through Taiwan 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. Li stated that despite the "sincerity" and "patience" of 
the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX 
Olympiad (BOCOG) and its hope that the Olympic torch would 
pass through to Taiwan, the Taiwan side again "unilaterally" 
halted discussions in September.  The International Olympic 
Committee (IOC) has thus decided that a torch route through 
Taiwan cannot be realized, Li said. 
 
September 30 DPP "National Congress" 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶6. Li said the TAO has condemned the "so-called normal nation 
resolution," when asked about the possibility that the 
resolution would be passed at the Democratic Progressive 
Party's (DPP) September 30 "National Congress."  Asked about 
a call for the referendum on UN membership to substitute for 
Yu Shyi-kun's call to use "Taiwan as the national title," the 
spokesman stated TAO's firm opposition to any "independence" 
and "splittist" activities. 
 
Cross-Strait Tourism 
-------------------- 
 
¶7. The spokesman said that allowing Fujian residents to 
travel to Penghu and Kinmen from Xiamen on October 2 is 
"great news," adding that it serves to actively promote 
Mainland tourism to Taiwan.  Li stated that the Mainland has 
long promoted cross-Strait tourism and charter flights and 
has for many years called and hoped for the removal of 
"political interference" and the realization of these goals

as soon as possible, when asked about DPP presidential 
hopeful Frank Hsieh's promotion of cross-Strait tourism, 
charter flights and investment in an interview with the 
Straits Times.
