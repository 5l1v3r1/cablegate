¶1.  This cable is sensitive but unclassified; please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In an action hailed by concerned Moroccans as a 
step towards democracy and equality, parliament passed an 
amendment to the Nationality Code allowing women married to 
non-Moroccan men to pass Moroccan citizenship to their 
children on February 1.  The Moroccan women's marriages must 
have been contracted in accordance with the 2004 Family Law, 
article 146.   The mother must declare to the Ministry of 
Justice that the child will have Moroccan citizenship. 
Children whose fathers are from countries where dual 
nationality is not permitted will be able to choose their 
nationality when they reach the age of 18.  The king has 
reportedly signed the law, which only needs publication to 
enter into force. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The 1958 Nationality Code had made it difficult for 
children of mixed nationalities to receive state grants for 
university and fully participate in Moroccan society as their 
residency permits had to be renewed on a regular basis.  Some 
are children of fathers from other Arab countries; others are 
from a growing number of Moroccans married in Europe. 
Moroccan citizenship is difficult to obtain.  Press reports 
indicated that only 1,646 non-Moroccans had received 
citizenship since 1965.  Currently, the Ministry of Justice 
is reviewing 500 new applications for citizenship. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Comment: In July 2005, King Mohammed VI, during 
his Throne Day speech, made it clear he was in favor of 
Moroccan citizenship passing to children through their 
mothers as well as their fathers.  Moroccan press reports 
have given the king full credit for this initiative and 
applaud his efforts.  The passage of this bill is a major 
reform and is one for which parliamentarians and members of 
civil society organizations have been lobbying for several 
years.  Some Moroccans hail the bill as a major step forward 
in gender equality.  End Comment.
