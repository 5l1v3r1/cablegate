Other legislative priorities delayed yesterday's (March 
3) scheduled vote on Brazil's new energy model (Ref A) by 
one day.  A Senate contact has told us the vote is expected 
to take place later today (March 4) after a plenary debate 
in the Senate, which we have confirmed was underway as of 
early-afternoon local time.  Industry representatives 
continue to lobby furiously, including the visiting Duke 
International President, who will meet with Minister of 
Mines and Energy Dilma Rousseff this afternoon with a 
request for eleventh-hour changes to render the new model 
less detrimental to current private investors.  It looks 
unlikely that industry will achieve any such major changes 
in the bill at this stage.  If it were to do so, the 
legislation would have to be returned to Congress's lower 
chamber for reconciliation and a further vote there.
