SUBJECT: KIRKUK GOVERNOR SURVIVES ATTACK, LAYS OUT PRIORITIES 
 
Sensitive but unclassified; please handle accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Kirkuk Governor Mustafa survived a human bomb 
attack on his car November 28. This was the first time this 
tactic had been used in Kirkuk. Mustafa was pessimistic that the 
provisions of Constitutional Article 140 on the final status of 
Kirkuk would be completed on schedule. Stronger support from the 
Prime Minister was needed to spur progress. Mustafa thought U.S. 
force deployment in the area should be robust during Article 140 
implementation. Mustafa next will visit Baghdad 14-15 December 
in a trip coordinated by PRT-Kirkuk. Mustafa's determined 
response to the bomb attack is likely to benefit the Provincial 
Government's public standing. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) At about 0800 November 28, Kirkuk Provincial Governor 
Mustafa survived a suicide attack on his motorcade. Mustafa was 
in his armored sedan when his convoy passed a congested area 
adjacent to a construction site in downtown Kirkuk. A suicide 
bomber wearing a booby-trapped vest waited in the crowd and 
jumped on the windshield of the car, detonating himself. Exact 
casualty figures remain unclear, but the explosion killed at 
least one of Mustafa's PSDs and seriously wounded 18 others. The 
Governor escaped injury, although his car was completely 
destroyed. U.S. security experts here note that this is the 
first time a bomber attacked a convoy in this manner in Kirkuk. 
This was the second attempt on the Governor this month. 
 
¶3. (U) Despite the attack, the Governor continued to his office 
at the Kirkuk Governorate Building. He immediately went on local 
television, expressing concern for those killed or wounded in 
the blast and indicated his determination not to let the attack 
deter him from his duties. He then worked a full day. Just hours 
from the attack, Gov. Mustafa met with U.S. officials (incl. 7th 
ID CDR MG Mixon, BG Bednarek, PRT Leader and REO Director) at a 
scheduled meeting to exchange views on security. MG Mixon laid 
out a security plan for judges as a pillar of Rule of Law 
strategy. Meanwhile, Governor Mustafa said the recent attack on 
the Kirkuk gasworks caused a local energy shortage, but it could 
be met with Iraqi militaryv (IA) stockpiles. More broadly, he 
would like to work with the U.S. to implement better defenses 
for strategic infrastructure. 
 
¶4. (SBU) MG Mixon said that all should work with IA commanders 
to address these goals, noting that by the end of next year 
there should be fewer coalition forces in the area. Mustafa said 
reducing U.S. troops in the area was a bad idea. If anything, 
there should be more of a U.S. military presence given the 
uncertainties of Article 140 implementation. Asked if he thought 
a vote on Kirkuk's final status would occur as planned, Mustafa 
said he was pessimistic. Active and public support for full 
implementation needed to come from the Prime Minister for any 
real progress, he said. There was no movement on other, long 
standing issues raised during the discussion-- on plans to issue 
weapons permits, nor on fielding more local police. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In closing, Mustafa observed that the U.S.-supplied 
armored vehicle that had just saved his life was the only one in 
his Governate's inventory. He asked directly if the U.S. could 
give him another. MG Mixon and his staff doubted any were 
available locally. Gov. Mustafa and Mixon will follow up on a 
scheme for regular secure travel to Baghdad for Kirkuk 
provincial senior staff, and Mustafa confirmed his own 
PRT-coordinated travel to the capital 15-16 December to meet 
with the Ministries of Housing, Oil, Water and Finance. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT: The Governor's response to the attack, 
immediately broadcasting to the Province and then continuing 
with his work day, was an impressive performance that will 
contribute to public confidence in the Provincial Government. 
With two attacks against him just in the last four weeks, it 
seems likely that he will continue to be targeted. Replacement 
of his armored vehicle should be a high USG priority.
