SUBJECT: INL MANAGUA PD&S PLAN FOR FY 2009 
 
REF: STATE 131778 
 
¶1.  INL Managua submits its fiscal year 2009 PD&S budget plan per 
reftel. 
 
¶2.  INL Managua's PD&S needs will increase due to the hire of two 
new INL Program Assistants, one focusing on budget management and 
the other on logistics management.  Post anticipates increased 
travel costs as several new projects are planned and will require 
travel by the INL Coordinator, INL Program Manager, and the INL 
Program Assistants. Post estimates that ICASS costs will rise given 
an increase in projects and demands on FMC and GSO.  The total 
anticipated PD&S budget for FY 2009 is 474,950 including ICASS.

¶4.  Post has already received $50,000 in FY 2009 PD&S. 
 
¶5.  Explanation of items by object class. 
 
1100 Salaries (and overtime): Salary amount is based on an FSN 11, step 1 position, an FSN 09, step 9 position and an FSN 09, step 1 position. The increase is due to the reclassification of the current INL Program Assistant, an FSN 09, as an INL Program Manager at the FSN 11 level who has assumed greater program management responsibilities as well as supervisory responsibility over two new INL Program Assistant Positions, at the FSN 09 level. One of the new INL Program Assistants will have primary responsibility for all budget and administrative issues, including management of one INL project. The other INL Program Assistant will have the primary responsibility of logistics management pertaining to INL inventory, End Use Monitoring and follow-up on INL procurements. Even with a full time INL Program manager and two administrative assistants, INL anticipates the need for overtime, particularly with new projects planned with the receipt of Merida funds in 2009.
 
1200  Benefits:  Benefit amount is commensurate with grade of FSN 
positions. 
 
2153 Conference travel: This increase is being added for conferences, staff training and development (particularly for the new INL Coordinator, FSN Program Manager, and the two new FSN INL Assistants). This amount will also cover financial related training for the new budget specialist and cover attendance at other INL conferences.
 
2156  Field travel:  This amount is essential to cover travel 
expenses and per diem for monitoring/implementing projects 
throughout the country. Several new projects are planned and will 
require frequent travel to monitor their progress. Travel to the 
Atlantic Coast must be done by air and can be quite expensive. 
 
2322 Telephones: These amounts will increase due to the newly FSN 
INL Assistants and will cover telephone expenses for both cell 
phones and office phones. 
 
2325 U.S. Postal/Dhl/Othcsv: These fees will increase commensurate 
to the increased number of new projects we will implement. 
 
2329 Telephones: These amounts will increase due to the new FSN 
hires and are to cover telephone expenses, both cell phones and 
office phones. 
 
2600 Office Supplies & Materials: Office Supplies will increase due to the new FSN hires and the increased amount of administrative work that have been incurred by recent project launches and by the launch of future planned projects. Supplies include office and ADP supplies.
 
3156 Computer:  This will be for a one-time purchase of a new 
computer for the new hire of a FSN INL Program Assistant responsible 
for logistics management.  The computer for the FSN INL Program 
Assistant responsible for budget and administrative management was 
purchased with 2008 funds. 
 
2589 ICASS: Between FY 08 and FY 09, INL Managua increased its 
overall activity level by approximately 300%, liquidating 
approximately 1.2 million dollars worth of pipeline.  This increase 
in productivity tripled INL Managua costs not only in procurements 
and obligations/vouchers but also in ICASS distribution costs, a 
reflection of the greatly increased burden INL operations imposed on 
ICASS workload this year (2.53% in FY 09 as opposed to .71% FY 08). 
Post projects that ICASS costs will also increase with the two new 
hires as FSN INL Program Assistants and a further increased burden 
on FMC and GSO with the receipt of funding for the Merida 
Initiative.
