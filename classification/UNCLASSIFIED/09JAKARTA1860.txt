REF: STATE 112900 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  The United States and Indonesia hold an 
annual Strategic Dialogue and biannual Bilateral Defense 
Discussions.  These discussions are productive, and Mission 
seeks to augment them under the proposed U.S.-Indonesia 
Comprehensive Partnership by adding an annual set of 
strategic consultations, potentially led by the Under 
Secretary for Political Affairs, and a separate set of policy 
planning talks.  END SUMMARY. 
 
REGULAR CONSULTATIONS 
 
¶2. (U) This cable provides Mission's response to reftel 
request for information on bilateral security dialogues.  The 
primary U.S.-Indonesia security forums are as follows: 
 
-- The Indonesian-United States Strategic Dialogue (IUSSD) 
meets annually.  Participants include DOD/OSD, the Indonesian 
Defense Department, State, the Indonesian Joint Military, 
U.S. Joint Staff, DAO, the Office of Defense Cooperation 
(ODC), and PACOM; 
 
-- Bilateral Defense Discussions (BDD) are held biannually to 
discuss training.  PACOM, Service Components, the Indonesian 
Joint Staff, and ODC are the key players in these meetings; 
and, 
 
-- Ad hoc discussions designed to plan and update IMET are 
held as needed.  This is a local meeting between the ODC and 
the Indonesian Joint Staff. 
 
¶3. (U) The IUSSD and BDD were established through formal 
agreements in 2005.  The IUSSD agreement is between OSD and 
the Defense Ministry.  The BDD agreement is between PACOM and 
the Indonesian Joint Staff.  The ad hoc discussions are 
informal in nature, are based on good relations, and are 
conducted when the need to review IMET arises. 
 
¶4. (U) The location of the IUSSD alternates between the U.S. 
and Indonesia.  It was last held in July 2009 in Indonesia. 
The next meeting is scheduled for June 2010.  Like the IUSSD, 
the BDD alternates venues, but is normally held twice per 
year, in August and January in Jakarta.  The last BDD was 
held in Honolulu in July 2009, and the next will be held in 
January 2010.  The DASD co-hosts the IUSSD and the PACOM J50 
(Deputy Policy Director) co-chairs the BDD. 
 
APPRAISAL OF DIALOGUES 
 
¶5. (U) The existing dialogues are generally dynamic and 
useful.  For example, the last IUSSD focused on the following 
specific areas: (1) maritime security/regional 
stability/counterterrorism; (2) professionalization and 
modernization of the Indonesian military, including civilian 
control; and (3) the Indonesian military's ability to respond 
to domestic humanitarian crises, overseas peacekeeping 
operations and disaster assistance.  While the productivity 
of a given iteration depends on the depth and level of 
preparation of participating officials, dialogues to date 
have been productive.  The DAO, ODC, and PACOM find them very 
particularly useful in providing a framework for ongoing 
discussions. 
 
PROPOSED ADDITIONS 
 
¶6.  (U) Under the proposed bilateral Comprehensive 
Partnership, the U.S. and Indonesia seek to deepen engagement 
on security matters by initiating policy planning and 
strategic consultations.  The form and timing of these 
discussions have yet to be determined, but the planned first 
round of strategic consultations would be held during U/S 
Burns's visit to Indonesia in early December.  Also, a 
Defense Cooperation Agreement was first proposed by the 
Indonesians at the 2007 IUSSD.  Negotiations on the framework 
for the DCA are ongoing.  Post considers that it would be 
useful to conduct regular policy planning talks.  As the 
November 4-5 visit of Special Advisor for Nonproliferation 
and Arms Control demonstrated, regular consultations on 
nonproliferation could also be useful for advancing that 
agenda.
