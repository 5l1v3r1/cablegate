HIGHLIGHTS 
 
¶1. (U) Dr. Surin Pitsuwan replaced outgoing Secretary General Ong 
Keng Yong as leader of the ASEAN Secretariat in an official ceremony 
on January 7 in Jakarta.  Dr. Surin pledged to continue to advance 
ASEAN's goals of creating a single market, narrowing the development 
gap, and promoting a peaceful and prosperous Southeast Asia. 
Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda spoke about the need for 
member countries to embrace the ASEAN Charter and for member country 
citizens to share a common ASEAN identity.  Jacky Foo, Director 
General for ASEAN in the Singaporean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
closed the ceremony by presenting Singapore's Instrument of 
Ratification of the ASEAN Charter to Dr. Surin. 
 
¶2. (U) Although Secretary General Ong raised the anniversary of the 
U.S.-ASEAN dialogue in his remarks, he and the other speakers did 
not include the U.S. among their several examples of cooperation 
with dialogue partners.  Ong highlighted areas of collaboration with 
ASEAN's other dialogue partners, including progress on ASEAN's FTAs 
with Korea, Japan, India, Australia, New Zealand and the EU.
