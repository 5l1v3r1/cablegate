SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF SECTION 565 PROHIBITION 
AGAINST CONTRACTING WITH FIRMS THAT COMPLY WITH THE ARAB 
LEAGUE BOYCOTT OR DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF RELIGION 
 
REF: STATE 166398 
 
¶1.  USINT Havana requests a waiver of Section 565 of Title V, 
Part C of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal 
years 1994 and 1995 (PL 103-236) (22 USC 2679c) as it applies 
to contracts that expend funds appropriated to the Department 
of State, and that would go to persons who comply with the 
Arab league Boycott of Israel, or who discriminates in the 
award of subcontracts on the basis of religion. 
 
¶2.  In accordance with the terms of both restrictions, USINT 
Havana would be required to avoid contracting with the Cuban 
government, or with entities under the control of the Cuban 
government.  However, the Cuban government requires all 
diplomatic missions to contract with one government entity, 
CUBALSE, for all requirements for supplies and services.  As 
the sole supplier to the diplomatic community, there is no 
option for USINT Havana to seek another source.  CUBALSE 
writes all the contracts itself and does not accept contracts 
written by others, nor will it accept any additional clauses 
of any nature by anyone. The Cuban government also restricts 
severely the importation of goods and services from outside 
of Cuba.  Without local suppliers of goods and services, 
USINT Havana would be unable to carry out the functions 
assigned to it as a diplomatic mission.
