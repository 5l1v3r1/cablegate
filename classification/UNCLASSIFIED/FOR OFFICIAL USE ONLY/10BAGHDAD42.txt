Secretary Johnson utilized his December 11-15 Baghdad trip to

vision for the police training mission, which would focus on 
higher-level, managerial, and specialized skills development.  Iraqi 
and USG officials voiced support for the civilian-led effort.  Iraqi 
Ministry of Interior (MOI) officials underscored the important role 
of civilian-led training in establishing police primacy in the 
security realm.  Justice Minister Dara and Chief Justice Medhat also 
thanked INL for its support following recent bombings.  Overall, 
Iraqi leaders were supportive of INL's assumption of the police 
training mandate as an extension of its well established judicial 
and corrections programs.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
USG OFFICIALS VOICE SUPPORT 
--------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) INL Assistant Secretary David Johnson, accompanied by INL 
Director for Iraq Virginia Ramadan, met with GOI and USG officials 
in Erbil and Baghdad from December 11 to 15 to review ongoing INL 
programs in police, justice and corrections, and to convey INL's 
commitment to continued support of these programs beyond the 
withdrawal of US military forces in December 2011. During a brief 
trip to Erbil, Johnson met with the KRG State Minister for the 
Interior Sinjari, who expressed his region's continuing need for 
expanded INL programming, especially in justice and police training. 
 He offered his assistance in securing the use of Iraqi training 
facilities in Erbil for INL's future police development program. 
 
¶3. (SBU) During his meetings with USG officials in Baghdad, Johnson 
outlined the broad plans for transitioning the police training 
mandate from the U.S. military to the Embassy, and INL's support for 
more focused, higher-order training crucial for development of a 
strong civilian police force in Iraq. USG officials agreed that the 
transition is a top priority for both the military and Embassy, and 
all necessary steps should be taken to guarantee its success. 
 
MOI LOOKS TO TRANSITION 
----------------------- 
¶4.  (SBU) Johnson outlined the concept underlying the INL-led 
program to MOI Senior Deputy Minister Adnan al-Assadi and Senior 
Advisor to the Interior Minister Rafae Muhane, emphasizing that the 
transition will appear seamless to the GOI.  He explained that the 
smaller INL-led program will focus on higher-level, specialized 
training and mentoring in areas highlighted by the GOI as important, 
such as leadership and management, community policing and criminal 
investigations.  Such training would operate out of hubs in Baghdad, 
Erbil, and Basra.  Echoing Johnson's emphasis on the importance of 
police primacy, al-Assadi and Rafae expressed support for a 
civilian-led police training mission and repeated previous requests 
for specialized training. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Al-Assadi underscored that the MOI still needs USG support 
as it transforms from a recruiting and basic training phase to that 
of building a more sophisticated law enforcement organization. 
Qof building a more sophisticated law enforcement organization. 
Thanks to the U.S. military's good work, the MOI is well staffed and 
trained at a basic level, he said.  Now, the MOI needs to focus on 
streamlining and acquiring higher-level skills.  He welcomed USG 
assistance in such areas as community and family policing. 
Al-Assadi noted the high utility of past INL courses provided by 
subject matter experts, specifically the FBI and ATF.  Al-Assadi 
commented that once the transition gains momentum, the MOI General 
Planning Department will form a complementary Iraqi committee 
comprised of representatives from different ministries to work with 
INL Baghdad. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Muhane told Johnson that the successful police training 
transition from the military to INL is critical for Iraq's success. 
Emphasizing the importance of establishing civilian police primacy, 
Muhane commented that there will increased momentum and focus on 
security sector reform after the elections occur in March.  At the 
moment, he remarked, all security issues are political. 
 
CHIEF JUSTICE LOOKS TO PARTNERSHIP 
---------------------------------- 
¶7. (SBU) Higher Judicial Council (HJC)Chief Justice Medhat expressed 
 
BAGHDAD 00000042  002 OF 002 
 
 
to A/S Johnson deep appreciation for INL's continued support to 
modernize the Iraqi judiciary and said he looked forward to a 
long-term relationship with the Embassy.  He affirmed his interest 
that the INL-funded Judicial Development Institute should serve as a 
venue for increased engagement between the police and judicial 
investigators.  Medhat also thanked INL for its prompt assistance 
during the recent bombings in providing equipment, vehicles and 
office space to set up temporary satellite offices. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Johnson complimented strides made by both the Iraqi 
judiciary and police over the last few years.  He agreed that the 
HJC and INL had a strong relationship, stressing that the HJC has 
led the partnership.  Johnson noted that INL stands ready to 
continue its support of the HJC's five-year plan. 
 
JUSTICE MINISTER THANKS INL 
--------------------------- 
¶9. (SBU) Justice Minister Dara expressed appreciation for Embassy 
assistance in the wake of the October 25 bombing.  Dara highlighted 
the broad, complex mandate of the Justice Ministry, including real 
estate record management, Shura Council operations, and the Judicial 
Training Institute (JTI).  Johnson underscored INL's commitment to 
help the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) with its security, highlighting 
courthouse upgrades developed in partnership with the MOJ. He noted 
that overall INL training and mentoring will shift from training 
recruits to mentoring senior management in advanced skills; INL 
Baghdad would subsequently meet with the MOJ to discuss assistance 
to Iraqi corrections officers. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Dara mentioned that during his visit to the U.S. in 
October he had requested U.S. support for the GOI to represent Iraqi 
victims and prosecute companies  which were in violation of the UN 
Oil for Food program.  Johnson reiterated that INL does not have 
authority over this issue, and again suggested that the MOJ discuss 
these concerns with the DOJ. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Comment:  A/S Johnson's visit has established a clear 
framework for a successful and smooth transition from the military 
focus of support for Iraqi security forces to advanced civilian 
police training.  The Iraqi Government has welcomed this shift and 
is committed to making this an effective partnership  Johnson's 
description of INL's experiences and results worldwide in similar 
programs helped provide the GOI with an understanding the 
challenges, but also the support it will have, as it assumes greater 
and ultimately complete responsibility for all aspects of internal 
security in Iraq.
