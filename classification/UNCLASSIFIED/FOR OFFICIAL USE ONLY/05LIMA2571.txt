¶1. (U) Acting in his capacity as President of the Andean 
Community Council, Foreign Minister Manuel Rodriguez issued 
a statement on 6/7 expressing support for constitutional 
norms and democratic institutions in Bolivia.  Embassy's 
informal translation of the statement follows: 
 
(begin text) 
 
ANDEAN COMMUNITY COMMUNIQUE REGARDING THE POLITICAL 
SITUATION IN BOLIVIA 
 
The Governments of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, 
members of the Andean Community, express their profound 
concern regarding the political situation in the sister 
Republic of Bolivia.  Likewise, they wish to extend to 
President Carlos Mesa words of support and solidarity for 
his decision, one that was arrived at in hopes of reaching a 
democratic and constitutional solution in Bolivia, as well 
as contributing to the preservation of its democratic 
institutions. 
 
The Andean Community member states wish to make an appeal to 
all political forces in Bolivia so that the handling of 
President Mesa's resignation is carried out with total 
respect for the constitutional norms of the country and for 
existing commitments regarding the protection and 
preservation of democratic institutions in all countries in 
the region. 
 
Finally, the Andean Community member states wish to convey 
to the Government of Bolivia their complete willingness to 
contribute to the stability and preservation of the 
constitutional and democratic institutions of the country.

¶2. (SBU) COMMENT.  Generally speaking, the GOP prefers to 
sign on to group declarations regarding the internal 
political situation in neighboring countries, as opposed to 
making unilateral declarations.
