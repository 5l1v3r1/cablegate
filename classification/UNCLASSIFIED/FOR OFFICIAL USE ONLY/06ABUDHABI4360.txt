¶2. (SBU) On November 16, Econchief met with Abu Dhabi Water and 
Electricity Authority (ADWEA) Director of Planning and Development 
Ahmed Saif Al-Darmaki to discuss the status of the two power stations 
that Abu Dhabi had pledged to provide to Iraq.  Al-Darmaki said that 
ADWEA had identified the contractor and was ready to ship the 
stations (i.e., generators and all associated equipment) to Iraq as 
soon as the Government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi authorized the 
transfer and the funding.  He said that the decision was with the 
Office of Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan. 
 Al-Darmaki also noted that he had the sense that the Iraqi Minister 
of Electricity was not interested in the generators.  At the 
Electricity Minister's July meeting with ADWEA Chairman Sheikh Dhiyab 
bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the Minister reportedly said that for just a 
little more money Iraq could get new generators.  Al-Darmaki added 
that the previous government had identified a location within Iraq 
for the generators.  Should the new government still want the 
generators, it would likely identify a new location. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Al-Darmaki told econchief that ADWEA was a member of the 
board of the current effort to link the GCC electricity grid.  He 
explained that Iraq had proposed connecting to the grid, but that 
Kuwait had objected.  He noted that the Iraqis would have needed to 
connect through Kuwait and that the Kuwaitis already had major power 
problems.  ADWEA had proposed having the UAE firm Taqa (75% owned by 
the government of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi) invest in a large 2,000 
Mw power plant in Basra, which could connect to both Kuwait and Iraq. 
 He said that ADWEA had secured GCC agreement in principle and was 
now looking for an investment partner and access to the gas in South 
Iraq. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Finally Al-Darmaki said that Taqa was in talks with a U.S. 
company about "buying substantial shares" in it.  He explained that 
Taqa was looking for overseas investment opportunities.
