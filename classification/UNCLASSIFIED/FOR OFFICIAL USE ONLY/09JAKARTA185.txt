¶1. (U) This is an action request. See paragraph 3. 
¶2. (U) On February 4, Ambassador Hume delivered a letter from Mary 
Glackin, NOAA's Acting Administrator to Freddy Numberi, Minister of 
Marine Affairs that affirmed NOAA's interest in marine partnership 
but declined the invitation to send the Okeanos Explorer to Manado 
for the World Ocean Conference.  Ambassador Hume explained that 
engineering concerns prevented the ship from coming during the May 
timeframe but that NOAA hoped to send it in 2010 once fully 
operational.  Minister Numberi thanked the Ambassador for post's 
efforts and noted that he would welcome alternate ways for NOAA to 
participate in the WOC. 
 
 ¶2. (SBU) Minister Numberi asked for senior level Washington 
representation on the U.S. delegation for the WOC and Coral Triangle 
Initiative (CTI) Summit, noting that Australian Prime Minister Rudd 
had already confirmed his attendance.  The Minister plans to request 
that Foreign Minister Hassan Wirayuda raise the WOC during a 
potential meeting with Secretary Clinton.  Minister Numberi 
specifically requested that the Ambassador encourage incoming NOAA 
Administrator Jane Lubchenco and interested congressional members to 
participate. 
 
¶3. (U) The Minister said that he would present information on the 
WOC at the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) meeting in 
Nairobi on February 16.  The Minister asked that U.S. participants 
at this meeting register U.S. support for the WOC/CTI.  Action 
Request:  Post supports the importance of the WOC and requests that 
U.S. participants at the UNEP meeting convey USG support.  Post's 
ESTH office will email materials on the WOC and CTI to Embassy 
Nairobi for possible distribution at the meeting.
