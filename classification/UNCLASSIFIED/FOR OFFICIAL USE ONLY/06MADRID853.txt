(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points on April 7 to MFA 
Subdirector General for Human Rights Fernando Fernandez Arias 
and to MFA Assistant Subdirector General for the Middle East 
Teresa Lizaranzu.  Lizaranzu said that the issue of Iranian 
treatment of the Bahai was very much a priority and that the 
EU had made numerous in Tehran calling for protection of 
their rights.  She said the next GAERC would include a 
specific point expressing concern regarding the conditions of 
the Bahai and other minorities in Iran.  Lizaranzu said these 
efforts took place in the context of a broader push by the EU 
for improved human rights practices by the government of Iran.
