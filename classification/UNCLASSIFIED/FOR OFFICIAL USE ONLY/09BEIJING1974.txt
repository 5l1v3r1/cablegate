1302 CASES OF 2009 A/H1N1 CONFIRMED, NOTIFICATIONS TAPERING 
---------------------------- ------------------------------ 
 
¶1.  (U) China's Ministry of Health (MOH) informed Post on 
July 13 that as of July 11, it would no longer be sending 
daily notifications on newly-confirmed H1N1 cases and directed 
us to the MOH website for the latest H1N1 information.  MOH 
now posts a daily announcement on their website that includes 
the total number of confirmed cases and the total number 
recovered and released to date, but no longer reports 
information on the locations of the new cases or whether cases 
are isolated for treatment at a designated hospital or at 
home. 
 
¶2. (U) According to MOH, as of COB on July 11, there have 
been 1302 confirmed cases of infection by the novel 2009 
influenza A/H1N1.  Of the 1302 confirmed cases, MOH reported 
that as of July 11, 1085 infected patients had recovered and 
been released from treatment.  To date, there have been no 
deaths or severe complications due to novel 2009 influenza 
A/H1N1 in China. 
 
 
CHINA EASES QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION MEASURES, AMCIT CASES 
DROP 
------------------- ---------------------- ------------------- 
- 
 
¶3. (U) On July 8, MOH released new H1N1 prevention and 
control guidance geared toward provincial and local health 
authorities, encouraging them to suspend quarantine of Qclose 
contactsQ in centralized locations and provides the option to 
treat Qmild casesQ of confirmed cases at home.  The guidance 
gives local governments latitude to decide how to implement 
these new guidelines. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Reports from Consulates indicate that following the 
new guidance, local authorities are emphasizing home 
quarantine for exposed persons and home isolation for mild 
cases of confirmed infection by H1N1.  Guangzhou, which had 
already begun to loosen its quarantine and isolation measures 
for Chinese citizens resident in the Pearl River Delta a week 
earlier (REF A), has extended these new practices to include 
all persons. Only those displaying flu-like symptoms at ports 
of entry will be sent to hospitals for testing; even for 
confirmed H1N1 cases, hospital treatment and Tamiflu are no 
longer recommended in China for mild cases.  Guangdong Health 
Department authorities also report that following these new 
measures, medical fees incurred for H1N1 treatment will no 
longer be paid by the Chinese government.  (NOTE: Before the 
July 8 MOH guidance, the Shanghai Health Department had also 
announced a shift in its control strategy and measures, 
loosening screening procedures and moving away from mandatory 
quarantine of close contacts (REF A). END NOTE) 
 
¶5. (SBU) With the easing of quarantine and control measures, 
Consulates have experienced a steep drop-off in new A/H1N1 
AmCit quarantine cases, with the total number of AmCits in 
quarantine down from over 200 as of July 1(REF A), to less 
than a dozen countrywide as of COB on July 13. 
 
 
MOH RESPONSE TO CDA REQUEST FOR HOME QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION 
------------------ -------------------- --------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) On July 10, Embassy Beijing received an official 
 
BEIJING 00001974  002 OF 002 
 
 
MOH 
response to CDAQs July 2 letter to Minister Chen requesting 
permission for self-quarantine and home-isolation for the 
mission community (REF A).  The response leaves the door open 
for home treatment of Qmild casesQ of confirmed infections, at 
the discretion of the local Health Departments.  The response 
makes no mention of a request to self-quarantine close 
contacts at home, probably because following the new MOH 
guidance on July 8 the practice of quarantine of close 
contacts in centralized locations should no longer officially 
exist.  In practice, however, Post could continue to see 
residual cases of centralized quarantine of close contacts 
until all localities implement home quarantine procedures.
