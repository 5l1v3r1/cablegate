SUBJECT: Ambassador Discusses Pharmaceuticals, Afghanistan and Other 
Issues with Health Minister 
 
REF: STATE 3361 
 
¶1.      (U) In his introductory call with Norwegian Minister of 
Health and Care Services Anne-Greth Strom-Erichson on February 10, 
the Ambassador 2010 discussed intellectual property problems facing 
research-based pharmaceuticals companies, Afghanistan, the H1N1 
pandemic, and other issues. 
 
¶2.      (SBU) Pharmaceuticals:  The Ambassador noted gaps in 
Norwegian intellectual property protection for certain 
pharmaceuticals patents filed before 1992.  He informed the 
Minister that Norway had been placed on the Watch List in the U.S. 
Trade Representative's Special 301 Report in both 2008 and 2009 
over this issue, and urged the GON to take steps to address the 
problem.  The Minister spoke frankly that she had not been aware of 
this issue and assured the Ambassador that she would look into it. 
 
 
¶3.      (SBU) Afghanistan:   The Ambassador thanked the Minister, 
who had been Defense Minister until 2009, for Norway's support in 
Afghanistan, while noting that the United States could use even 
more help.  Strom-Erichsen, who said she had visited Afghanistan 
ten times as Defense Minister, agreed that Norway could do more and 
said she would have liked for Norway to do more. 
 
¶4.      (U) Other Health Issues:  Strom-Erichsen said she was 
interested in the U.S. health care system, and noted that a 
parliamentary delegation would visit Kaiser Permanente's offices in 
San Francisco next week.  She said one of the key issues in the 
Norway's health sector is the question of how much service 
provision should be public and how much private, and offered her 
view that both were needed.  The Minister recalled that she had to 
deal with the H1N1 pandemic and the vaccination issue during her 
initial days in office, but opined that the GON had handled the 
issue well.  The Ambassador highlighted his strong interest in 
promoting both business and educational exchange with the United 
States, and offered that there were promising possibilities for 
collaboration with Norway's health care sector and with 
institutions of higher education.
