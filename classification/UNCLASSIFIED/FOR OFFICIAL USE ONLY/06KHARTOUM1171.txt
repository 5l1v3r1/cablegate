SUBJECT:  VICE PRESIDENT MACHAR SAYS UGANDA AGREES TO 
GoSS MEDIATION WITH LRA 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) United Nations High Commission for Refugees 
(UNHCR) Operations Manager for South Sudan Bhairaja 
Panday told CG on May 16 that he had received a telephone 
call from GoSS Vice President Riek Machar informing him 
that the Government of Uganda (GOU) had declared itself 
open to a role for the Government of Southern Sudan 
(GoSS) in mediating between Kampala and the Lord's 
Resistance Army (LRA).  Panday said that an ebullient 
Machar informed him GoSS President Salva Kiir brought 
back this message from President Museveni after Kiir 
delivered the message from the LRA leadership that they 
were ready to talk.  Due to the September 16 GoSS holiday 
in honor of the founding of the SPLM, we have been unable 
to corroborate this message with other sources in the 
GoSS. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Panday added that Machar said that the LRA had 
agreed to halt all attacks against targets in Sudan.  He 
noted that this would permit UNHCR to resume the 
operations in Yei that stopped following an attack on 
UNHCR premises there in which two UNHCR staff members 
were killed.
