DRAFT MOU 
 
REF: STATE 129187 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Political Counselor discussed reftel points 
December 21 with Ambassador Gabor Horvath, Deputy Director of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Security Policy and 
Non-Proliferation Department.  Horvath stated the MFA 
"totally supported -- full stop" the concept of increased 
civilian deployment and concluding an agreement.  He noted, 
however, that the Ministry of Defense hoped to clarify 
several issues in the draft memorandum relating to force 
protection requirements, e.g., how often U.S. personnel 
expected to move off base. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Lieutenant Colonel Laszlo Bagi, Chief of the 
Ministry of Defense's Peacekeeping Operations Department, 
separately stated that the MoD would provide its comments on 
the force protection issue back to MFA within the next 
several days.  Bagi assured us that the MoD wanted to work 
closely with us to resolve any questions.
