SUBJECT:  UNGA:  ARMENIANS "NOT READY TO COMMIT" ON 
PALESTINIAN RESOLUTION 
 
REF:  STATE 92528 
 
(U) Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please treat 
accordingly. 
 
(SBU) We delivered demarche and talking points on the 
Palestinian draft General Assembly resolution regarding 
the Observer Mission's representation to MFA 
International Organizations Department Head Levon 
Mkrtumyan April 27 per reftel instructions.  Mkrtumyan 
said that Armenia was "not ready to commit" regarding 
the resolution because Armenian FM Oskanian had not yet 
discussed the issue with Armenia's mission in New York. 
Mkrtumyan noted, however, that the GOAM felt it had 
"cooperated and voted well with Washington" during 
recent UNCHR meetings in Geneva on the Cuba and China 
resolutions.  He hinted that, given GOAM cooperation on 
these votes, the GOAM did not feel a great deal of 
pressure to side with the USG on this issue.  He said, 
however, that the GOAM's mission in New York would take 
all opinions into account over the next few days.
