REF: STATE 24665 
 
(SBU) Poloff conveyed points March 18 to Ifigenia Argueta 
Sanchez of the Foreign Ministry's Office for the UNSC urging 
Mexico to make public statements in support of the African 
Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).  Argueta affirmed GOM's 
support for AMISOM in strengthening Somalia in this period of 
transition and the Somalia security sector given the problem 
of piracy along the Somali coast.  She said she would convey 
our interest that Mexico issue a statement in support of 
AMISOM at the UNSC debate on Somalia March 20.
