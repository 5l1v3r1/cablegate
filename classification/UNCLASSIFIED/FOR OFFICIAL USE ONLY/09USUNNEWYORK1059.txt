SUBJECT: SECURITY COUNCIL CALLS FOR INCREASED COOPERATION 
TO ADDRESS THE LRA THREAT 
 
¶1. (SBU) UN Department of Political Affairs U/SYG Pascoe 
briefed the Security Council on November 17 in closed 
consultations on the UN's efforts to address the Lord's 
Resistance Army (LRA).  He said that the UN was improving its 
inter-mission cooperation and information sharing, and that 
the UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC) was offering the Ugandan 
defense forces logistical support.  MONUC reported fewer than 
100 LRA members in the DRC, where over the last year the LRA 
was reported to have killed 700 civilians, abducted more than 
1,400, and displaced 270,000.  Pascoe noted atrocities were 
continuing in Southern Sudan, with reports of 216 killed, 149 
abducted, and 79,000 displaced, and in the Central African 
Republic (CAR), with 9 attacks reported since September.  He 
said that the UN has had no contact with LRA leader Joseph 
Kony for more than 18 months, and that Kony's whereabouts 
were unknown. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador DiCarlo expressed concern at the LRA's 
expansion into Sudan and CAR.  She was joined by all Council 
members in calling for greater UN cross-mission information 
sharing.   She also encouraged the UN to establish mechanisms 
to improve cooperation and coordination among its operations 
in the region. French Deputy PermRep de Riviere requested 
that the Secretary-General report on how to improve regional 
and inter-UN cooperation to respond to the LRA threat. 
 
¶3. (SBU) UK Deputy PermRep Parham said that UNMIS must be 
willing to act to protect civilians, and urged greater 
cooperation between the Ugandan forces and the UN.  Ugandan 
PermRep Rugunda said regional cooperation was good, and urged 
all UN actors, including the peacekeeping missions in the 
DRC, Sudan and Darfur, and CAR, to improve cooperation and 
coordination and improve the protection of civilians, and 
noted that at present more than 90 percent of LRA members 
were non-Ugandan. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Following the meeting, the President of the Council, 
Austrian PermRep Mayr-Harting, read a press statement agreed 
to by Council members.  The statement, inter alia, encouraged 
states in the region to cooperate fully and share information 
with the UN, and called on the UN missions in the region to 
coordinate strategies for protection of civilians in light of 
the attacks by the LRA.
