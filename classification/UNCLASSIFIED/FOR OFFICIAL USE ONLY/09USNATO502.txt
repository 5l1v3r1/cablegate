Press Release: (2009) 160 
 
NATO Secretary General statement on consultations for the way 
ahead in Afghanistan 
 
The North Atlantic Council and troop contributing nations of 
the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) met today 
with representatives of the United States Government to 
consult on the way ahead in Afghanistan. 
 
The 43 nations exchanged views on priority issues following 
the conclusion of the Afghan electoral process and ahead of a 
final decision on the strategic approach and associated 
resource requirements.  Allies and non-NATO troop 
contributing nations welcomed the opportunity to exchange 
views on critical questions.  These included: challenges such 
as proposals to enhance the training and development of the 
Afghan National Security Forces; the need for the appointment 
of an inclusive government in Kabul to give the international 
community a strong and reliable partner; and ways to enhance 
the civilian component of international community efforts in 
Afghanistan and improve its coordination.  The meeting also 
reinforced the importance of an effective regional approach, 
stressing the importance of improved cooperation between 
Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
 
The NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, recognised 
the clear sense of continued commitment to Afghanistan from 
the troop contributing nations.  He urged all nations to 
re-examine what further resources they could make available 
in terms of military, financial or civilian contributions to 
help the Afghans take an increasing lead in managing their 
own affairs.
