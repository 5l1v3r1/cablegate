REF: STATE 74305 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel points to Djibouti Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Deputy Director of Bilateral Affairs Youssouf Aden 
Moussa on July 17. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Moussa reemphasized Djibouti's vital national interest in 
combating piracy off the Somali coast, especially to protect the 
security and economic viability of the Port of Djibouti.  Moussa had 
no immediate response on concrete steps the GODJ might take in 
implementing UNSCR 1816, but said he would transmit the points to 
the Ministry of Justice and other relevant GODJ technical agencies 
for comment.  Post will follow up with the MFA and report any 
subsequent responses. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: While the Djiboutian Navy participated in 
interdiction exercises earlier this year with French and U.S. 
military representatives as part of the Proliferation Security 
Initiative (PSI), the relatively small size of Djibouti's military 
limits its ability to participate effectively in CTF-150.  Moreover, 
at least one-half to three-fourths of Djibouti's military forces are 
currently forward deployed in northeastern Djibouti, due to recent 
border tensions with Eritrea.  The Djiboutian Navy is comprised of 
approximately 18 small craft, including several small boats provided 
by the USG.  Although the GODJ supports this concept, the 
operational reach of the Djiboutian Navy is limited to its 
territorial waters.  It is further restricted to patrols close to 
existing bases due to the limited range and endurance of its 
inventory.  Their current capability does not support effective 
patrolling near Somali territorial waters, nor does it support 
effective and persistent patrols in international waters adjacent to 
Djiboutian territorial waters.  The USG, using FY07 Section 1206 
funds, is constructing a naval pier at Obock, in northern Djibouti; 
its completion, anticipated by October 2008, will enhance the 
Djiboutian Navy's ability to patrol its coastal waters.  Djibouti 
does host German military representatives supporting the German 
frigate participating in CTF-150; earlier this year, Djibouti also 
cooperated with French military forces rescuing hostages from a 
hijacked French vessel.  In implementing UNCSR 1816, the GODJ is 
more likely to be able to offer other types of assistance, such as 
judicial assistance, rather than naval support.  END COMMENT.
