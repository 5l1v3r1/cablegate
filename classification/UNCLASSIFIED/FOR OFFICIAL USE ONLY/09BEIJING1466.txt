43 CASES OF 2009 A/H1N1 CONFIRMED, 10 AMCIT CASES 
----------------------------- ------------------- 
 
¶1.  (U) As of COB June 2, China's Ministry of Health (MOH) has 
officially communicated information about 43 confirmed cases of 
infection by the novel 2009 A/H1N1 influenza virus and one suspected 
case.  Ten of those confirmed cases involve American citizens. 
Confirmed cases have been detected in eight provinces and the 
municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, with the greatest number of 
cases occurring in Guangdong Province (13), Beijing (11), and 
Shanghai (7). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Cases involving American citizens have been reported in 
Beijing, Guangdong Province (multiple locations), and Henan 
Province.  Consular officers in Beijing and Guangzhou have 
established and maintained contact with Amcits being treated in 
local hospitals.  The first Amcit case, one involving a 65 year-old 
male whose infection was confirmed on May 22, was released from 
Ditan Hospital in Beijing on May 27. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The Ministry of Health also reports that four Canadian 
nationals and one Venezuelan national are being treated in 
isolation, with confirmed infection by A/H1N1. 
 
 
"VOLUNTARY" SELF-QUARANTINE RECOMMENDED 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The Chinese government is now recommending that travelers 
arriving from countries or regions "where H1N1 prevails," including 
the United States, should "stay at home for self-monitoring for 
seven days" after arrival (irrespective of whether they themselves 
have flu symptoms).  Quarantine officials at airports are 
distributing information cards to all international arrivals to that 
effect. 
 
¶5. (SBU) While official contacts have stressed that this measure is 
strictly voluntary, Post has received reports that some local 
authorities are being exceedingly cautious and are imposing 
mandatory quarantine periods on all American travelers hosted by 
their institutions.  Reports of trip cancellations, postponements, 
and refusals to receive American visitors for meetings have become 
increasingly common. 
 
¶6. (SBU) On June 1, Beijing ACS issued a warden message to the 
American community mission-wide, alerting them to this 
recommendation by the Chinese government.  The warden message also 
urged travelers to communicate early and often with respective tour 
groups, host institutions, or hotels before departing for China, to 
determine what self-quarantine procedures (if any) they likely will 
face upon arrival.  The same information has been posted on Embassy 
and Consulate websites. 
 
SCREENING PROCEDURES 
------------------- 
 
¶7. (U)  ConGen Guangzhou reports that as of May 25, the initial 
temperature cut off point was revised to 37 degrees Celsius (down 
from 37.5).  This revision has been applied to airports, land border 
crossings, and sea ports, where thermal imaging equipment is being 
used.  If a passenger's temperature is above 37 degrees Celsius, the 
thermal imaging equipment will sound an alarm.  The passenger will 
then undergo a second temperature test.  If the temperature is above 
37.5 degrees Celsius, or the passenger exhibits flu-like symptoms, 
the passenger will be referred to the local CDC.  (NOTE:  This 
measure appears to apply primarily to the border province of 
Guangdong, where the greatest number of "imported cases" have been 
reported.  END NOTE)

¶8. (SBU)  An Amcit man reported to Beijing ACS that he was 
quarantined on May 31 while trying to depart China on a flight to 
San Francisco.  He said he had received his boarding pass and was 
about to go through security screening when temperature sensors 
detected he had a fever.  He was quarantined at Ditan Hospital in 
Beijing before being released on June 2.  Post has thus far not 
heard of other instances of Amcits being quarantined while 
attempting to leave China, but will report on any similar cases that 
may occur.
