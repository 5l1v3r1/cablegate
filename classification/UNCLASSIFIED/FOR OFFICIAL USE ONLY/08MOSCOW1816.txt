Â¶1. (SBU) On June 24, we discussed the October 2008 UNEP-hosted 
Mercury Working Group Meeting with Oleg Shamanov, Head of the Global 
Environment and Health Section of the MFA's International 
Organizations Department.  Shamanov said that the GOR had not yet 
formulated a definitive position on the best way to address mercury, 
including whether a binding agreement or a voluntary partnership 
would be the most appropriate international vehicle.  He said the 
MFA would need to discuss the issue further with the Ministry of 
Natural Resources and Ecology.  He hoped the GOR would be in a 
position to discuss the issue more substantively within two weeks. 
We will continue to follow up with the MFA as the GOR works to 
develop a position on mercury.
