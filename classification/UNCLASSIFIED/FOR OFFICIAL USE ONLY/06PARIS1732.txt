Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please Treat Accordingly. 
 
¶1.  Deputy Polcouns discussed reftel points on rights of 
dependent territories March 16 and again March 17 with MFA IO 
Political Affairs DAS-equivalent Jean-Hughes Simon-Michel, 
whose office is also responsible for decolonization issues 
but does not deal directly with the UN Economic Commission 
for Latin America and the Caribbean.  We spoke separately 
March 17 with IO Latin American desk officer Bernard Guidee 
to follow up further. 
 
¶2.  Both Simon-Michel and Guidee stated that France fully 
shared the U.S. view that it is not appropriate for other 
countries to decide on the nature of the participation of 
non-autonomous territories.  France would have objections 
similar to those of the U.S. if other countries were to make 
similar proposals affecting one of its overseas territories. 
 
¶3. Both Simon-Michel and Guidee clarified that France would 
support the U.S. position on this issue despite the fact, in 
this specific case, that the French territories located in 
Latin American and the Caribbean are all overseas 
"departments" rather than "territories," and thus not be 
subject to the draft resolutions in question.  French 
departments, even overseas, are considered to be simple 
extensions of the French mainland, where French law applies 
fully, as in the case of Hawaii for the U.S.  (Note:  Under 
the French "DOM-TOM" designation, Guadeloupe, Martinique, 
French Guyana, St. Martin, St. Barthelemy, and Reunion are 
all overseas departments, whereas New Caledonia and French 
Polynesia are territories.) 
 
¶4. Neither Simon-Michel nor Guidee were personally familiar 
with the specific UN Economic Commission discussed reftel, 
but undertook to find out more about their delegations 
instructions for the March 20-24 meeting.  After further 
consultations within the MFA, however, Guidee subsequently 
reconfirmed the French position as stated above and informed 
us that Paris would instruct the French delegation to the 
March 20-24 ECLAC session to join the U.S. in opposing the 
resolution.
