¶1. (U) This cable contains sensitive but unclassified 
information - not for distribution on the internet. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Pirated movies appear to remain readily on 
sale in Sichuan Province's capital city of Chengdu.  Packaging 
is of such a high quality that the average consumer probably 
cannot distinguish between legitimate and fake DVDs.  Retail 
stores along the city's "European Street" prominently display 
large quantities of pirated Western DVD movies.  U.S. television 
shows are also available for sale.  In another part of the city, 
unboxed DVD copies of Western movies are commonly available from 
street-side vendors and in a popular electronics market.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
Small Details Raise Questions about Authenticity 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Many of what appear to be pirated DVD movies for sale 
in Chengdu stores we surveyed have high-quality packaging that 
looks legitimate.  The high-quality color cover graphics and 
plastic DVD cases are quite similar to those available at 
retailers in the U.S.  A number of the movies also have 
cardboard slip covers that fit over the outside of the plastic 
DVD case.  The movies have clear plastic wraps, like DVDs in the 
U.S. and some have hologram stickers, ostensibly to show the 
authenticity of the product. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) During a recent trip to three stores on Chengdu's 
"European Street," Congenoff was impressed  that nearly all of 
the DVD movies for sale, based on a quick look at the front and 
back of boxes, looked as if they might be legitimate. 
Descriptions, quotes, and graphics on the back of the boxes 
generally looked identical to legal copies of the DVDs.  Closer 
inspection raised doubts about the authenticity of the products. 
In fine print at the bottom of the boxes, Congenoff saw 
inconsistencies suggesting the movies were pirated.  On the back 
of 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment's "Max Payne" and "Mr. 
and Mrs. Smith," Congenoff found typographical errors in the 
fine print legal text; words were misspelled, improperly 
capitalized, or incorrectly run together.  Carrefour's flagship 
store in Chengdu, also sold Miramax Home Entertainment's "An 
Unfinished Life" and Canadian Muse Entertainment Enterprises' 
"The Deal" with similar errors in the fine print. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) U.S. television shows on DVD are also widely available 
in Chengdu.  These are generally sold in box sets that appear 
very similar or identical to those in the U.S.  Once opened, 
however, there is frequently evidence of piracy.  Discs are 
often sitting loose in a cardboard cavity inside the box.  Discs 
may have little or no artwork on them, and some may have Chinese 
characters near the center of the disc. 
 
 
 
Disclaimers and Release Dates Suspicious, Others Hard to Say 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
 
CHENGDU 00000030  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) DVDs of recently-released U.S. movies like "Rock `N 
Rolla," "Burn after Reading," and "Body of Lies" that Congenoff 
recently saw for sale had lines included in the fine print that 
said the movie was not available for sale outside Canada, the 
U.S. or its territories.  In one instance, a box set of the HBO 
series "Rome" had a line indicating it was not available for 
sale outside the EU.  A customer, however, would need to have 
excellent English-language skills and carefully read the back of 
the box in order to notice such disclaimers. 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) Sony Pictures' "Quantum of Solace," scheduled for 
release on DVD in the U.S. in March, was available at local 
stores within a few weeks of its November 2008 debut in 
theaters.  Producers of the pirated version of the film appear 
to have used the movie's promotional posters to create a 
professional looking box cover.  The movie is also sold with a 
cover that mirrors the artwork from the movie's soundtrack. 
Columbia Pictures' "Seven Pounds" is another movie, yet to be 
released on DVD in the US, which is already available in 
Chengdu.  The DVD box cover retains the line "coming soon," 
suggesting that the cover art was lifted from the movie's 
promotional material. 
 
 
 
¶8. (SBU) Congenoff could not determine whether or not some 
movies might be legitimate copies.  Excel Media, a 
Guangdong-based media firm, claims to have partnership 
agreements with several major movie studios to distribute their 
films in China.  Some DVDs that had Excel Media branding on the 
back of the package lacked the imbedded holograms in the plastic 
that apparently-legitimate copies of Excel DVDs contained.  Not 
all pirated DVDs for sale in Chengdu, however, are of such a 
high quality.  Some have packaging with prominently displayed 
words that can only be described as "Chinglish," while some 
American film DVDs are sold in packages with movie descriptions 
written in Russian, Thai, and Spanish. 
 
 
 
Local Enforcement of Copyrighted Movies 
 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶9. (SBU) Numerous street-side vendors and hawkers in the local 
electronic markets also offer pirated DVD movies.  Nearly every 
evening, vendors set up on sidewalks near the Consulate to sell 
Chinese and Western DVDs.  Public security officials commonly 
patrol the area, but Congenoff has never seen the officials 
question the vendors about their goods.  Hawkers in one of 
Chengdu's large electronics markets openly approach patrons and 
offer DVDs.  Congenoff has seen titles like "Quantum of Solace" 
available for sale.  Congenoff has not observed, during multiple 
trips to the market, officials attempting to crack down on these 
hawkers. 
 
 
 
¶10. (SBU) The Sichuan Provincial Intellectual Property Rights 
Office (SCIPO) does not directly enforce or regulate copyright 
infringement of movies or software.  When Congenoff raised the 
issue of apparently-pirated movies in Chengdu's stores, the 
Director of SCIPO said that they would refer any cases to the 
 
CHENGDU 00000030  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
Copyright Bureau (CB).  The CB would follow up on any 
allegations of piracy.  In the case of alleged DVD or software 
piracy, SCIPO officials said that CB would check to ensure the 
retailer was authorized to sell the merchandise in stock. 
SCIPO's 60 staff members, however, appear to focus primarily on 
patent registrations.  During a recent visit to SCIPO's office, 
officials showed Congenoff where individuals could file patent 
applications and obtain information about the filing process. 
 
 
 
¶11. (SBU) COMMENT:  SCIPO was formerly the Sichuan Patent 
Office.  In 2000, the Patent Office changed its name to reflect 
broader responsibility for intellectual property rights, but it 
does not appear to have direct authority to enforce copyright or 
trademark infringement.  Post will continue to try to monitor 
the piracy situation on the streets of Chengdu and raise our 
concerns with local authorities.  END COMMENT.
