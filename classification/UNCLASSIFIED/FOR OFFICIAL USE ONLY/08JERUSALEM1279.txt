the NSF from crossing the tunnel that connects Qalqiliya and 
Habla village.  PA police report confiscating and 
dismantling/flattening 31 stolen/unregistered vehicles July 
15-17 as part of this security campaign.

personnel and resources.  They said they expect increased 
security activity to start tapering off by July 20, and will 
then focus on maintaining security improvements.
