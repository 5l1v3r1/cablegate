SUBJECT: NIGER: GOVERNMENT SUSPENDS MSF-FRANCE OPERATIONS 
 
¶1. (U)  The Nigerien Interior Ministry in a decree dated July 
18 suspended the operations of Medecins Sans 
Frontieres-France (MSF-F) in Niger. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a July 29 meeting with the DCM, the head of the 
French chapter of MSF in Niger, Emmanuel Lavieuville, 
explained that, contrary to press reports, the decree did not 
specify either the national chapter of MSF suspended, or the 
region where the suspension applies.  Informally, however, 
MSF-France understands that the decree applies only to it, 
and not to the other MSF chapters operating in Niger. 
Lavieuville explained that 98 percent of MSF-France's 
activities are in the Maradi region, and the other 2 percent 
are in Agadez.  The Maradi program focuses on combating 
malnutrition.  It also works on health issues such as 
meningitis, measles and malaria.  The GON forced MSF-France 
to suspend its Agadez program last fall after three MSF-F 
vehicles were stolen in a short time frame, which the GON 
considered "voluntary imprudence" on MSF-F's part. 
Speculation at the time was that the GON believed that the 
vehicles had been taken by the rebel group MNJ, with possible 
MSF-F complicity.  MSF-F resumed its Agadez operations about 
three months ago. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Lavieuville said that the GON did not give a reason 
for the suspension, and MSF has not formally asked for one. 
He noted that relations between MSF-F and the GON have been 
strained since at least the 2005 food crises, as well as GON 
suspicions that MSF-F sympathized with the MNJ.  He 
speculated that the event that may have triggered the 
suspension was MSF-F's recent receipt of a large financial 
contribution from an Emerite-based organization, which the 
Ministry of Public Health may have thought should have gone 
through it. 
 
¶4. (SBU) After receipt of the Interior Ministry decree, MSF-F 
immediately suspended its preventative activities in Maradi 
and is shutting down its curative activities over 3-4 weeks. 
On July 25 MSF-F requested a meeting for its President with 
the Nigerien President and Prime Minister, through the 
Nigerien Embassy in Paris.
