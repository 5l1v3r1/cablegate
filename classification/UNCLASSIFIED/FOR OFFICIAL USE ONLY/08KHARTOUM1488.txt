SUBJECT: UN ANNOUNCES TWO DEMINING CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAMS 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 1440 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: The United Nations Mine Action Office (UNMAO) 
announced plans to roll out two multi-year training programs to 
build the capacity of local demining organizations that will assume 
overall program responsibility from UNMAO mid-2011.  The Planning 
and Monitoring Project will emphasize strategic planning and 
oversight of all aspects of demining in Sudan.  The Quality 
Management Project will "train-the-trainers" on accreditation, 
procurement, and IT management.  UNMAO plans to seek funding for 
these programs at the next donor conference in November 2008 in 
Geneva. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On Sept 28 Poloff met with Lou Luft, UNMAO Chief of 
Operations and Planning and Christina Greene, UNMAO Program Officer, 
to discuss future demining training that will build the capacity of 
Sudanese demining organizations.  Luft announced two training 
programs to be rolled out in 2009-2011 if funding is obtained.  The 
goal of each project is to strengthen national mine action 
institutions and enable local contributors to better plan and 
monitor all aspects of mine action in Sudan, including accreditation 
and licensing.  The timing of the training programs is flexible due 
to uncertainty surrounding elections and CPA implementation. 
 
Program 1 - The Planning and Monitoring Project 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶3. (SBU) The Planning and Monitoring project will train ten 
individuals from the Northern Mine Action Center (NMAC) and ten 
individuals from the South Sudan Demining Commission (SSDC) through 
one-on-one mentoring and on-the-job training over a three-year 
period. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Phase 1 will commence in 2009 and consist of a four-to-six 
week mentoring program sponsored by the National Authority. 
Trainees will shadow officials, learn how to create and oversee 
annual work plans, and hone prioritization skills.  Emphasis will be 
on risk assessment and mitigation.  The training will be 
supplemented by three workshops to be held in Sudan using UNMAO 
facilities to emphasize planning, equipment procurement, technical 
support, and advocacy.  Phase 2 will start in 2010 and will focus on 
how to run programs and operations with particular attention to Mine 
Risk Education (MRE) and Victims' Assistance.  Phase 3, in 2011, 
will comprise specialized instruction on long-term planning and 
advocacy for mine action both nationally and internationally. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The mentorship partners for this training are NMAC, SSDC, 
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Sudan Commission 
to Ban Land Mines (SCBL).  Program costs for this program start at 
1,600,000 USD for Phase 1 and drop to 1,300,000 USD for each 
subsequent year.  Funding has yet to be identified, but will be 
requested at the next meeting of states signatory to the Ottawa 
Convention on landmine eradication in Geneva in November 2008. 
 
Program 2 - The Quality Assurance Program 
----------------------------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) The three-year Quality Assurance (QA) program will train on 
management and coordination of the National Technical Standards 
(NTSGs) and accreditation systems, and the Information Management 
System for Mine Action (IMSMA). 
 
¶7. (SBU) Twenty-four course participants from NMAC and SSCD will 
participate in mentorship programs and on-the-job-training with the 
national authority.  Four adjunct workshops will also be held at 
UNMAO, Sudan, and will stress analysis of data, technical assistance 
and support.  Phase 2 would include field work with additional 
workshops on equipment procurement and "train-the-trainer" courses. 
Phase 3 will prepare participants to assume custodianship of ISMA. 
UNMAO would continue to provide monitoring and technical assistance. 
 Costs for this course are estimated at 1,600,000(USD) for Phase 1, 
1,300.000(USD) for Phase 2 and 1,200,000(USD) for Phase 3. Funding 
has not been identified for this training either. 
 
Comment: 
-------- 
¶8. (SBU) Demining in Sudan will continue into the foreseeable 
future; surveys have not been completed along the Eritrean and 
Chadian borders, or in Darfur.  Unexploded Ordinance (UXO) is 
widespread in Darfur with more accumulating given ongoing conflict 
there, according to UNMA's Christina Greene.  UNMAO anticipates an 
eventual drop in international donor funding so local program 
management is essential to the sustainability of demining efforts. 
The training programs outlined here should ensure some continuity as 
Sudanese authorities assume greater responsibility for these 
programs.
