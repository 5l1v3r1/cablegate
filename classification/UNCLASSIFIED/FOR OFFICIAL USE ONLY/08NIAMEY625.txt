REF: NIAMEY 616 
 
¶1. (U) The MNJ has claimed on its website that the GON 
delayed for 48 hours giving authorization to the ICRC travel 
to the north to pick up the four French uranium workers 
kidnapped on June 22 (reftel).  It also claims that early in 
the morning of June 24 the Nigerien Armed Forces used 
recently acquired attack helicopters to bomb MNJ positions, 
which it suggests puts at risk the four French hostages as 
well as a number of government troops being held by the MNJ. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The French DCM confirmed that as of 2:00 p.m. local 
time, the MNJ still held the four French hostages.
