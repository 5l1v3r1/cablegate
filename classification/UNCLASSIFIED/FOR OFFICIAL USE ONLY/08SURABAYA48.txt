¶1. (SBU) After months of bureaucratic debate between provincial 
election officials and the central government and contradictory 
court decisions, it appears that North Maluku will soon swear in 
a new governor.  At the formal request of the Ministry of Home 
Affairs, the North Maluku parliament held a plenary meeting 
April 16 to determine the next governor.  With 20 of 35 members 
in attendance, the plenary announced that Abdul Gafur and 
Abdurahim Fabanyo -- supported by Golkar, United Democratic 
Nationhood Party (PDK), and National Mandate Party (PAN) -- were 
the legitimate winners of the contested November 2007 elections. 
 Hundreds of supporters of incumbent Thaib Armaiyan and Gani 
Kasuba protested the decision in front of the governor's office. 
 Seven protestors were slightly injured as police dispersed the 
protestors.  In general, North Maluku has remained relatively 
calm during the lengthy election process (ref a), with small, 
usually non-violent demonstrations by supporters of both sides. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to local contacts, the Minister of Home 
Affairs and National Police Chief made a brief visit to Ternate 
on April 18 to meet with the interim Governor Timbul Pukianto, 
head of the North Maluku Attorney's Office, Provincial Police 
Chief, Maluku Military Commander, Ternate Military Commander, 
and local religious and youth leaders.  Alwy Sagarf, Director of 
local station Radio Diahi, told ConGen Surabaya the two-hour 
visit at the airport VIP lounge demonstrated that the central 
government was not serious about resolving local problems. 
"They are wasting state money." 
 
Kerosene Prices Double 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Alwy Sagarf commented to ConGen Surabaya that the 
majority were fed up with the election dispute and more focused 
on how to pay for food, kerosene, and LPG.  North Maluku is one 
of Indonesia's poorest provinces, ranking 27 out of 33 on the 
Human Development Index.  In the past month, the price of 
kerosene (a staple for most families) has doubled from Rp 
2,500/litre (USD 0.27) to Rp. 5,000/litre (USD 0.55) and lines 
are growing as supplies diminish.  Alwy Sagarf explained that 
shortages were caused by national oil company Pertamina's 
shipping delays from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, and Makassar, South 
Sulawesi to Ternate.  LPG is also in short supply and costs are 
rising.  The price of a 12-kg canister of LPG has reached Rp 
138,000 (USD 15) and is expected to climb further.  By contrast, 
East Javanese residents pay Rp. 54,000 (USD 5.94) for 12 kgs. 
(ref b).  The government's gas conversion program is not yet 
implemented in North Maluku.
