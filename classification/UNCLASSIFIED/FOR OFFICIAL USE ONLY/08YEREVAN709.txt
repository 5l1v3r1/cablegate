SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (SBU) On August 26, 2008, the directors of Armenian and Turkish 
Public TV and Radio signed a Memorandum on Cooperation that 
envisages broadcasting joint musical programs, documentaries, and 
films depicting life in the two countries.  Both sides plan to send 
permanent news correspondents to each other's capitals.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
AN UNEXPECTED INVITATION 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) Public TV and Radio Council Chairman Alexan Haroutunian 
explained to Embassy representatives the background and substance of 
the recently signed Memorandum on Cooperation between the public 
television stations of Turkey and Armenia.  At the annual meeting of 
the European Broadcasters' Union in Budapest this summer, the 
Turkish delegate handed the Armenian delegate an invitation from TRT 
Director Ibrahim Sahin addressed to Haroutunian.  Sahin invited 
Haroutunian to pay a visit to Ankara and Istanbul to discuss 
possible areas of cooperation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On August 25, a small Armenian delegation headed by 
Haroutunian left for Ankara where, on August 26, he and Sahin signed 
a Memorandum on Cooperation.  Haroutunian explained that this 
cooperation would include, in theory, shooting of documentaries and 
films depicting life in the two countries, the organization of 
concerts in Turkey and Armenia with the participation of music 
groups from both sides, placing foreign correspondents in each 
other's capitals and other provisions to facilitate the work of the 
two companies in Armenia and Turkey. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Haroutunian said he did several interviews while he was in 
Turkey and his visit received extensive press coverage.  He noted 
that the coverage on the Armenian side was considerably less, partly 
because of his personal reluctance to appear on television here. 
Harutounian said that he and his staff are very enthusiastic about 
cooperation with the Turkish side, and he hopes to be able to find 
funds for the implementation of these programs.  He indicated that, 
at least initially, the programming would seek to focus on 
non-controversial themes. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Haroutunian opined that the invitation was prompted in 
large part by the new openness of the Turkish government to dealing 
with Armenia, and specifically the upcoming visit by President Gul 
to attend the Turkey-Armenia World Cup soccer match. (Note: 
President Gul visited Yerevan on September 6. End note.) 
Ironically, cooperation on the soccer match was minimal, since both 
stations have to work through a German company that has the 
broadcast rights to the games.  Harutounian noted, however, that 
Sahin himself was favorably disposed to dialogue with Armenia, 
having been governor of a province on the border with Armenia and 
having visited the country several times.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) While this development is encouraging, the new agreement 
does not appear to commit either side to anything specific.  Lacking 
a budget, it remains to be seen how soon any of these joint projects 
get off the ground.  Perhaps the most promising aspect of the 
initiative would be the placing of permanent correspondents in each 
other's capitals, a development that could improve the quantity and 
quality of reporting on developments in the two countries.  Armenian 
Public TV hopes to have a correspondent in place in Turkey by early 
next year at the latest. END COMMENT.
