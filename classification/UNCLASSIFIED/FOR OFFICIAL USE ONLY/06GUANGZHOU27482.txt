REF: 05 GUANGZHOU 031999 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  AIR POLLUTION IN CHINA HAS GROWN SO BAD 
THAT CHINESE OFFICIALS ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THE CHALLENGE IT 
PRESENTS, AND VARIOUS FOREIGN SCHOLARS ARE OFFERING ALARMING 
STATISTICS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL AND HEALTH COSTS IT BRINGS. 
IN SOUTH CHINA, FACTORIES AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT 
SUPPORTS THEM GENERATE CONSIDERABLE AIR POLLUTION.  IN 
ADDITION, THE REGION CONSUMES VAST AMOUNTS OF "DIRTY" COAL 
FOR ENERGY, RARELY IMPLEMENTS EMISSION-CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES, 
AND IS HOME TO A GROWING NUMBER OF VEHICLES.  NOW THAT MANY 
OF THE POLLUTANTS THAT MAKE UP THE REGION'S HAZE ARE 
BEGINNING TO BE SCIENTIFICALLY MEASURED, THE FINDINGS ARE 
ALARMING.  HOWEVER, FINE PARTICLE (PM2.5) POLLUTION -- WHICH 
IS DEEMED TO BE OF HIGHEST CONCERN FOR PUBLIC HEALTH -- IS 
NOT MEASURED.  THOSE LOBBYING FOR ITS INCLUSION IN AN INDEX 
OF POLLUTANTS CONCEDE THAT INCLUDING A POLLUTANT WHOSE 
CURRENT LEVELS WOULD MEASURE SO FAR ABOVE ACCEPTABLE 
STANDARDS WOULD BE POLITICALLY DIFFICULT.  IT MAY BE TOUGH 
FOR LOCAL OFFICIALS, LONG HERALDED FOR THEIR ECONOMIC 
ACHIEVEMENTS, TO EXPAND THEIR FOCUS TO INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL 
CONCERNS WHEN IT CONFLICTS WITH THE NEED FOR ECONOMIC 
GROWTH.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) ANYONE WHO HAS SPENT TIME IN SOUTH CHINA IS ALL TOO 
FAMILIAR WITH THE BROWN HAZE THAT FREQUENTLY OBSCURES THE 
PEARL RIVER DELTA (PRD) REGION.  ECONOFF AND VISITING 
EMBASSY SCIENCE FELLOW -- WHO IS WITH THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION AGENCY'S (EPA) OFFICE OF AIR QUALITY PLANNING AND 
STANDARDS -- IN A TWO-PART SERIES OF CABLES LOOK AT THE 
CURRENT STATE OF AIR POLLUTION IN SOUTH CHINA (PART I), AND 
EVALUATE SOME OF THE MEASURES BEING TAKEN BY LOCAL ENTITIES 
TO COMBAT THE PROBLEM (PART II). 
 
CHINA:  A NATION OF POLLUTERS PAYING THE PRICE 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3. (SBU) CHINA IS GROWING INCREASINGLY INFAMOUS AROUND THE 
WORLD FOR ITS HIGH LEVELS OF POLLUTION.  POLLUTION HAS 
BECOME SUCH A LARGE PROBLEM THAT CHINESE OFFICIALS ARE NOW 
ACKNOWLEDGING THE CHALLENGE IT PRESENTS; PREMIER WEN JIABAO 
SURPRISED MANY EARLY THIS YEAR WHEN HE ADMITTED THAT 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION HAS BECOME THE WEAKEST ASPECT IN 
CHINA'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  THE DEPUTY CHIEF 
OF THE STATE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (SEPA) SAID 
PUBLICLY THAT DAMAGE TO CHINA'S ENVIRONMENT IS COSTING THE 
GOVERNMENT APPROXIMATELY 10% OF CHINA'S GDP (APPROXIMATELY 
USD 200 BILLION).  A HARVARD SCHOLAR PREDICTED THAT BY 2030, 
15% OF CHINA'S GDP WILL BE LOST TO THE INCREASED HEALTH 
COSTS AND MORTALITY DUE TO DOMESTIC ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION. 
A YALE SCHOLAR ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN HALF OF CHINA'S 
ANNUAL GDP GROWTH WOULD BE ELIMINATED IF THE FULL COSTS OF 
ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. 
 
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO AIR POLLUTION 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) CHINA IS HOME TO SEVEN OF THE TEN MOST AIR-POLLUTED 
CITIES IN THE WORLD.  A WORLD BANK REPORT NOTED THAT CHINAS 
HEAVY INDUSTRY AND RESIDENTIAL COAL BURNING -- WHICH 
PROVIDES ROUGHLY 70% OF CHINA'S ENERGY -- TOGETHER WITH 
INADEQUATE POLLUTION CONTROLS, RAMPANT DEFORESTATION, AND A 
SHARP INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF MOTOR VEHICLES ARE ALL 
FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO AIR POLLUTION.  WANG JINNAN, THE 
CHIEF ENGINEER AT THE CHINESE ACADEMY ON ENVIRONMENTAL 
PLANNING, PART OF THE STATE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
ADMINISTRATION (SEPA), SAID THAT ONE-THIRD OF CHINA'S URBAN 
DWELLERS CURRENTLY LIVE IN CITIES WITH LEVEL TWO OR HIGHER 
POLLUTION, WITH LEVEL TWO BEING CONSIDERED HARMFUL TO 
 
 
HEALTH, AND LEVEL THREE CONSIDERED "VERY DANGEROUS." 
 
¶5. (SBU) THE VICE MINISTER OF SEPA, ZHANG LIJUN, SAID AT A 
2005 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE THAT WORSENING AIR QUALITY, 
ESPECIALLY IN MAJOR CITIES, WAS LEADING TO "MORE AND MORE 
SERIOUS" HEALTH PROBLEMS.  HE ADDED THAT THE LEVEL OF AIR 
POLLUTION EMISSIONS IN CHINA MAY INCREASE 4-5 TIMES IN THE 
NEXT 15 YEARS UNDER A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL SCENARIO.  ZHEJIANG 
UNIVERSITY'S PROFESSOR CEN KEFA -- A HIGHLY-RESPECTED MEMBER 
OF THE CHINESE ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING WHO COLLABORATES 
CLOSELY WITH U.S. EPA SCIENTISTS -- SAID PUBLICLY IN MARCH 
2006 AT AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE THAT CHINA'S CO2 
EMISSIONS IN 2001 WERE THE SECOND HIGHEST IN THE WORLD AFTER 
THE UNITED STATES, AND ITS SO2 EMISSIONS WERE LIKELY THE 
HIGHEST. 
 
AND IN SOUTH CHINA AS WELL 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) IN THE PRD, INDUSTRIALIZATION, COMMERCIAL 
DEVELOPMENT, A RAPIDLY GROWING POPULATION, AND AN INCREASE 
IN MOTOR VEHICLES HAVE ALL LED TO SMOGGY AIR AND REDUCED 
VISIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE REGION.  THE PRD IS OFTEN REFERRED 
TO AS THE WORLDS FACTORY FLOOR, AND WHILE THE REGIONS 
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES HAVE CREATED AN ECONOMIC BOON FOR 
THE REGION, THESE FACTORIES -- AND THE POWER AND TRANSPORT 
INFRASTRUCTURES THAT SUPPORT THEM -- TYPICALLY USE 
INADEQUATE OR NO POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES AND THUS 
GENERATE CONSIDERABLE AIR POLLUTION.  A MARCH 2006 STUDY 
PUBLISHED ON ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ONLINE 
NEWS REPORTED THAT THE REASON EXPORT GOODS MANUFACTURED IN 
THE PRD ARE SO CHEAP -- AND HENCE SO DESIRABLE -- IS BECAUSE 
THE REGION LACKS POLLUTION CONTROLS.  THE PIECE ESTIMATED 
THAT A "SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE" OF SO2, NOX, AND PARTICULATE 
MATTER (PM) IN THE AIR CAN BE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE 
PRODUCTION OF EXPORTS. 
 
¶7. (SBU) THE GUANGDONG METEOROLOGICAL BUREAU'S DEPUTY 
DIRECTOR SAID PUBLICLY THAT THE POOR AIR QUALITY IN 
GUANGZHOU WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SO2 AND NOX DISCHARGED BY 
POWER PLANTS AND EMITTED FROM AUTOMOBILES.  (NOTE:  BECAUSE 
OF VARYING ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS, CARS DESIGNED AND 
MANUFACTURED IN CHINA EMIT MUCH HIGHER CO, NITROGEN OXIDE, 
AND HYDROCARBONS THAN U.S. AND JAPANESE MODELS, ACCORDING TO 
A GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY-PUBLISHED STUDY, THOUGH CHINA HAS 
ADOPTED EURO3 EMISSION STANDARDS FOR NEW VEHICLES.  END 
NOTE.)  THE CONCENTRATION OF SO2 IN GUANGDONG'S ATMOSPHERE, 
FOR EXAMPLE, HAS GROWN BY AN AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE OF 7.8% FOR 
THE PAST FIVE YEARS, ACCORDING TO HONG KONG PRESS REPORTS, 
EVEN THOUGH THE REST OF CHINA, ON AVERAGE, HAS EITHER 
DECREASED OR SEEN A LEVELING OF SO2 EMISSIONS.  A U.S. 
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY/ARGONNE NATIONAL LAB STUDY, HOWEVER, 
REPORTED THAT NATIONAL LEVELS HAVE STARTED TO INCREASE AGAIN 
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. 
 
GUANGDONG:  A TOP CONSUMER OF DIRTY COAL 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) GUANGDONG'S ENERGY CONSUMPTION IS BY FAR HIGHER 
THAN ANY OTHER PROVINCE IN CHINA.  MOST OF THIS ENERGY IS 
CREATED BY BURNING COAL (43% IN 2003, ACCORDING TO A RECENT 
STUDY BY A HONG KONG THINK TANK), WHICH GENERALLY GIVES OFF 
MORE POLLUTING EMISSIONS THAN EITHER GAS OR OIL.  COAL IS 
LIKELY TO REMAIN THE MOST IMPORTANT ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE 
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  GUANGDONG'S POOR AIR QUALITY IS 
EXPECTED TO FURTHER DETERIORATE BECAUSE THE PROVINCE HAS 
STARTED TO USE COAL OF INFERIOR QUALITY (I.E. WITH A HIGHER 
SULPHUR CONTENT) TO RUN POWER PLANTS AND INDUSTRIAL BOILERS 
DUE TO SHORTAGES OF LOW-SULPHUR COAL.  ACCORDING TO POWER 
INDUSTRY SOURCES, ONE-THIRD OF GUANGDONG'S POWER GENERATION 
IS SMALL-SCALE, OUTDATED, AND HIGHLY POLLUTING, BUT STILL 
USED BECAUSE OF ENERGY SHORTAGES IN THE RAPIDLY-GROWING 
REGION, NOT TO MENTION MANY OTHER SMALLER UNCONTROLLED 
 
 
INDUSTRIAL BOILERS.  ONLY 12% OF GUANGDONG'S COAL PLANTS 
HAVE EMISSION-CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS FLUE-GAS 
DESULPHURIZATION, AND EVEN THOSE PLANTS SOMETIMES KEEP THE 
EQUIPMENT OFFLINE TO CUT COSTS, ACCORDING TO THE HONG KONG 
PEOPLE'S COUNCIL ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AS REPORTED IN 
AN ENGLISH-LANGUAGE NEWS MAGAZINE.  FURTHERMORE, THE CHRONIC 
POWER SHORTAGES AFFECTING THE REGION MEAN THAT UP TO 90% OF 
MANUFACTURING PLANTS IN THE REGION USE BACKUP ELECTRICITY 
GENERATORS, WHICH ARE USUALLY LESS EFFICIENT AND MORE 
POLLUTING THAN GRID POWER. 
 
HAZY SKIES -- MEASURING THE TOXIC COCKTAIL OF POLLUTANTS 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) IN THE PRD, THE NUMBER OF LOW-VISIBILITY DAYS 
CAUSED BY HAZE HAS RISEN IN RECENT YEARS; GUANGZHOU, FOR 
EXAMPLE, HAS MORE THAN 150 GRAY-HAZE DAYS WITH LIMITED 
VISIBILITY EACH YEAR, UP FROM 90 DAYS PER YEAR IN 1999. 
COMMENDABLY, THE REGION NOW HAS AN INDEX TO MEASURE THIS 
POLLUTION, AS GUANGDONG PROVINCE AND HONG KONG AUTHORITIES 
JOINTLY LAUNCHED A GROUNDBREAKING PRD REGIONAL AIR QUALITY 
INDEX (RAQI) IN LATE 2005 (SEE REFTEL OR THE RAQI WEBSITE AT 
WWW.GDEPB.GOV.CN AND WWW.EPD.GOV.HK FOR MORE INFORMATION) TO 
MEASURE THE FOUR MAJOR REGIONAL AIR POLLUTANTS.  THE FOUR 
POLLUTANTS WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE VISIBILITY DEGRADATION 
(AS WELL AS A HOST OF HEALTH PROBLEMS) AND ARE REPORTED IN 
THE RAQI ARE:  RESPIRABLE SUSPENDED PARTICULATES (PM10), 
SULPHUR DIOXIDE (SO2), NITROGEN DIOXIDE (NO2), AND OZONE 
(O3).  MR. ZHONG LIUJI, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF GUANGDONG 
ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING CENTER (GDEMC), SAID PUBLICLY AT A 
2006 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE THAT THE PROJECTED PRD AIR 
QUALITY BETWEEN 1997-2010 IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT 
INCREASE IN THE EMISSIONS OF TWO OF THESE POLLUTANTS -- SO2 
(BY 40%), AND PM10 (BY 55%) UNDER A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL 
SCENARIO. 
 
¶10. (SBU) ONE OF THE MOST HARMFUL ASPECTS OF SOUTH CHINA'S 
AIR POLLUTION IS THAT IT CONTAINS VERY HIGH LEVELS OF 
RESPIRABLE SUSPENDED PARTICULATES, A COMPLEX MIXTURE OF VERY 
SMALL SOLIDS AND LIQUID DROPLETS ALSO KNOW AS PARTICULATE 
MATTER, OR PM.  PM IS TYPICALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CATEGORIES 
BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE PARTICLES -- PM10, WHICH MEASURES 
10 UM, AND PM2.5 WHICH MEASURES 2.5 UM.  PM10, WHICH 
ACCUMULATES IN THE LUNGS, CONTRIBUTES TO DAMAGED LUNG TISSUE 
AND DECREASED LUNG FUNCTION, AS WELL AS AGGRAVATED ASTHMA. 
PM2.5, WHICH IS MORE DANGEROUS TO HEALTH THAN PM10 BECAUSE 
THE PARTICLES ARE SMALLER AND CAN ENTER MORE DEEPLY INTO THE 
LUNGS, CONTRIBUTES TO ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS, INCREASES 
THE FREQUENCY OF CHILDHOOD ILLNESSES SUCH AS CHRONIC 
BRONCHITIS, CAUSES PREMATURE DEATH DUE TO ITS TOXICITY AND 
CARCINOGENS, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ALSO CAUSES CARDIOVASCULAR 
ILLNESSES SUCH AS HEART ATTACKS AND HEART BEAT 
IRREGULARITIES, ACCORDING TO A NUMBER OF RECENT STUDIES BY 
HARVARD AND OTHER RESEARCH INSTITUTES.  PM2.5 IS ALSO THE 
PRIMARY CULPRIT FOR VISIBILITY DEGRADATION BECAUSE IT 
SCATTERS AND ABSORBS SUNLIGHT. 
 
¶11. (SBU) IN 2002, THE EPA ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR FOR AIR 
SAID THAT "FINE PARTICLE (PM2.5) IS THE MOST SERIOUS 
POLLUTANT OF CONCERN FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT." 
IN OCTOBER 2005, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) ISSUED 
UPDATED GUIDELINES TO INCLUDE PM2.5 AS A KEY POLLUTANT AND 
LISTED SUGGESTED ANNUAL AND DAILY AVERAGE PM2.5 LEVELS 
TOGETHER WITH INTERIM TARGETS.  IN GENERAL, THE PM2.5 LEVELS 
IN GUANGDONG ARE TYPICALLY 5-10 TIMES HIGHER THAN THE 
SUGGESTED WHO GUIDELINE LEVELS, AND 2-3 TIMES HIGHER THAN 
EVEN THE FIRST-TIER INTERIM WHO TARGETS.  THE RAQI, HOWEVER, 
DOES NOT EVEN MONITOR (AND THUS DOES NOT INCLUDE) PM2.5 IN 
THE LIST OF POLLUTANTS.  HONG KONG OFFICIALS HAVE PUBLICLY 
ACKNOWLEDGED THE IMPORTANCE OF MONITORING PM2.5 IN THE 
INDEX, BUT THEY CONCEDE THAT INCLUDING A POLLUTANT WHOSE 
CURRENT LEVELS ARE SO FAR ABOVE ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS -- A 
SITUATION THAT IS NOT LIKELY TO IMPROVE ANY TIME SOON -- 
 
 
WOULD BE POLITICALLY DIFFICULT.  CHINA CURRENTLY HAS NO 
PM2.5 STANDARD.  HOWEVER, ZHONG LIUJI, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF 
THE GUANGDONG ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING CENTER (EMC) TOLD 
CONGENOFFS THAT IF HONG KONG ADOPTS PM2.5 STANDARDS, 
GUANGDONG WILL VERY LIKELY FOLLOW SUIT. 
 
COMMENT:  DIRTY AIR -- THE PRICE OF 
BREAKNECK ECONOMIC GROWTH? 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶12. (SBU) AIR POLLUTION IN SOUTH CHINA IS BAD AND GETTING 
WORSE, MIRRORING CONDITIONS IN MANY OTHER REGIONS IN CHINA. 
IT IS A SAD IRONY THAT THIS REGION OF CHINA -- SEEN AS A 
BEACON FOR POOR MIGRANTS WHO WANT TO FIND FAME AND FORTUNE - 
- HAS ACTUALLY BECOME HARMFUL TO THOSE MIGRANTS' AND OTHERS' 
HEALTH.  OFFICIALS WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE HOW HIGH A PRICE 
IN TERMS OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH THEY ARE WILLING TO 
PAY TO SUSTAIN THE REGION'S REMARKABLE GROWTH.  THUS FAR, 
THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH TAKES PRIORITY, BUT 
THIS MAY BE CHANGING.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE 11TH FIVE-YEAR 
PLAN, CHINA COMBINED "ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION" AND 
"ECONOMIC GROWTH" AS BINDING INDICATORS TO EVALUATE THE 
PERFORMANCE OF PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.  OFFICIALS 
ARE NOW TOUTING THEIR PLANS TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION DURING 
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.  WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT WHILE SOUTH 
CHINA'S GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IS WIDELY ADMIRED THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY, THE AIR POLLUTION THE REGION NOW EXPERIENCES IS 
MANIFESTLY UNENVIABLE.
