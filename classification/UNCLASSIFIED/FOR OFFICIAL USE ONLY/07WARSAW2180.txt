SUBJECT: POLAND WELCOMES PROPOSAL ON CUBA, AWAITING EU 
COMMON POSITION 
 
REF: STATE 147620 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel points to Mariusz Lewicki, 
Head of the Human Rights Section in the MFA,s UN Department. 
He welcomed and was very satisfied with the U.S decision to 
refrain from introducing a Cuba resolution at the current 
UNGA and to drop its call for a vote on the HRC package which 
eliminated the Cuba Special Representative. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Lewicki said that Poland appreciated the alternative 
proposal offered by the U.S, and remarked that a joint 
U.S.-EU action will pave the way for an alternative, 
non-confrontational method to address human rights concerns 
in Cuba. He noted that the EU was open and positive about the 
proposal, and has begun to coordinate a response to the U.S. 
Lewicki stated that the GOP did not see any formal or 
procedural obstacle for the proposed approaches, nonetheless, 
a broad consensus among the EU partners was needed. He 
alleged that EU,s response will be available soon, if 
partner states reach a common position through 
correspondence, if not, then the issue will be further 
discussed at the next COLAT or COHOM meeting. Lewicki 
speculated that most EU countries will support the proposal 
and specifically mentioned the Czech Republic and 
Netherlands, however, he did mention that Spain will likely 
try to soften the position.
