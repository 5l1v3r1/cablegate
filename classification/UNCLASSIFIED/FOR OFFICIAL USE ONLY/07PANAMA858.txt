REF: STATE 56397 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY. EconOff delivered REFTEL points on May 22 and 
23, 2007 to George Novey, Sub Administrator for the Aquatic 
Resources Authority (ARAP), and on May 23, 2007 to Deborah 
Siraze, International Economic Relations Division of the 
Ministry for Foreign Relations (MIRE).  Novey and Siraze told 
EconOff that the GOP would vote pro-conservation on each 
agenda item at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) 
meeting May 28-31 in Alaska.  They also said the GOP would 
not support the USG/Russia proposal regarding subsistence 
aboriginal whaling of bowhead whales.  The key issues for the 
GOP at the IWC are subsistence whaling by aboriginal 
communities, the protection of whale sanctuaries and 
safeguards on tourist-related whale watching.  Novey said he 
supports the Revised Management Scheme in so much as 
scientific knowledge of whales should be obtained regardless 
of the decision to permit commercial whaling.  Siraze said 
there needs to be more discussion on this issue.  Both said 
the GOP has not made any decision regarding any changes to 
the IWC mandate.  Novey said he was informed that the GOP had 
paid its IWC dues and would be eligible to vote.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) EconOff delivered REFTEL points on May 22 and 23, 2007 
to Novey and on May 23, 2007 to Siraze.  The GOP delegation 
to the IWC will be Anna Nunez from ARAP and Siraze.

GOP to Vote Pro-Conservation Down the Line 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (U)  Novey and Siraze told EconOff that the GOP will vote 
pro-conservation on each agenda item at the IWC. 
 
¶4. (U) Novey informed EconOff that for ARAP the key issues 
are request by countries such as the proposals by the US, 
Russia and Japan for quotas to allow for subsistence whaling 
by aboriginal communities.  Novey also said sustainable 
commercial whaling is of concern.  Novey said the GOP's 
policy to date is to continue the ban on whaling in all forms. 
 
¶5. (U) Siraze told EconOff that for MIRE the key issues are 
the protection of whale sanctuaries and the regulation of 
tourist-related whale watching to ensure the protection of 
whales. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
GOP Against USG/Russia Bowhead Quota Request 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Novey told EconOff that the GOP would oppose the 
USG/Russia request for the five-year 280 bowhead whale 
capture quota.  Novey said this decision comes from the MIRE 
and given that the GOP will be taking a pro-conservation 
stance on every item, it would be difficult to support any 
whaling no matter how small. 
 
¶7. (U) Siraze confirmed to EconOff the GOP's opposition to 
the USG/Russia the bowhead whale quota proposal.  Siraze said 
if the bowhead whaling quota issue was part of a packaged 
vote allowing other forms of subsistence aboriginal whaling, 
the GOP would have serious reservations about even 
considering supporting such a measure.  Siraze said if the 
bowhead whaling issue was voted upon separately, the GOP 
would consider the issue in light of the specific facts. 
 
¶8. (U) Siraze said that the GOP will be looking to vote with 
other Latin America countries as a bloc on each issue, and 
particularly on any subsistence aboriginal whaling issue. 
Siraze stressed the importance the GOP attaches to Latin 
America voting as a bloc on all issues before the IWC. 
 
------------------------- 
Revised Management Scheme 
------------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) Novey said he believed that scientific knowledge of 
whale populations should be determined regardless of the 
decision of countries to resume commercial whaling.  He 
believes that scientific information such as the one proposed 
by the scheme is not only useful for whaling purposes but 
provides an overall knowledge of the growth patterns and 
factors affecting different whale species populations. 
 
¶10. (U) Siraze said this issue requires further discussion, 
particularly among Latin American countries, before any 
 
 
decision could be made.

¶11. (U) Novey and Siraze said no decision has been made 
regarding any change to the IWC's mandate to include 
sustainable use or management issues.

IWC Dues Paid

¶12. (U) Novey said Anibal Culiolis, the Maritime Authority's 
Finance Director told him that the GOP had paid its dues and 
would be eligible to vote at the IWC.
