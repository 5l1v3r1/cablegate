SUBJECT: ANBAR GEO UPDATE:  ONGOING ELECTION PREPARATIONS 
 
¶1. (U) This is a PRT Anbar reporting cable. 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 2, PRT and MNF-West staff met with Anbar 
Governorate Electoral Office Director (GEO), Khalid Rajab, 
for a second time in Ramadi.  The GEO noted that there are 52 
registered entities for provincial elections in Anbar.  He 
intends to assign five schoolteachers for each polling 
station.  The GEO affirmed that he is receiving adequate 
logistical support.  The GEO's security manager, Omar 
al-Faraji, attended the Independent High Electoral Commission 
(IHEC)-sponsored security manager's course in Baghdad from 
October 25-30.  A recent survey of construction workers 
conducted in Ramadi suggests 71 percent of those interviewed 
intend to vote in the upcoming elections.  END SUMMARY. 
 
VOTER REGISTRATION CENTERS AND POLLING STATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶3. (SBU) PRT and MNF-West met with Anbar Governorate 
Electoral Office Director (GEO), Khalid Rajab, and his staff 
on November 2 at his downtown Ramadi office to discuss 
candidate nominations, voter education, and security 
preparations for the provincial elections in Anbar.  He made 
the following points: 
 
-- There are 52 registered entities; many are only 
one-candidate.  The GEO has submitted the candidates' names 
to the De-Ba'athification Committee for review. 
 
-- The GEO intends to assign five schoolteachers for each 
ballot box and estimates employing 11,000 workers 
province-wide for the elections.  Each will receive a month's 
salary for two weeks of work in connection with election 
duties. 
 
-- There will be 277 polling centers across Anbar for the 
provincial elections.  Each polling center will have several 
ballot boxes to service the estimated 360,000  voters 
expected to turnout on election day.  The GEO is planning for 
one ballot box per 400 voters. 
 
--The GEO designated 28 voter registration centers to be used 
for the Exhibition and Challenge period, when political 
entities have the right to challenge the validity of voters 
identified on the voter lists.  The challenge period ended 
November 12. 
 
-- The GEO plans to assign one interpreter at each polling 
center to assist international observers. 
 
-- The GEO affirmed that he is receiving adequate logistical 
support.  He received two new generators, extra Thuraya 
batteries, a metal detector, and additional equipment through 
a Development Alternatives Inc. (DAI) contract last week. 
This equipment is part of an IHEC initiative to ensure that 
GEOs countrywide have electrical power, communications, and 
security equipment. 
 
SECURITY 
-------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The GEO's security manager, Omar al-Faraji, attended 
an IHEC-sponsored security manager's course in Baghdad from 
October 25-30.  As a result, Omar says he is better prepared 
to ensure physical security of the ballots, their movement, 
and physical security of the polling centers. 
 
RAMADI ELECTION SURVEY DATA 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The GEO's preparations come against the backdrop of 
heightened voter anticipation for the forthcoming election. 
A recent survey of construction workers in Ramadi indicated 
that 71 percent of those interviewed intend to vote in the 
upcoming provincial elections, stating the need to make the 
provincial council more responsive to the populace.  However, 
their desire to vote does not appear to be linked to 
political awareness--few who expressed an intention to vote 
could identify current Provincial Council members.  Others 
said that their vote would not make a difference and that all 
political leaders are corrupt. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Some 360,000 Anbaris verified their registration 
data during the period ending August 28.  This number 
represents nearly 100 times the size of the voter turnout in 
¶2005.  This heightened sense of political mobilization 
reflects Anbaris' dissatisfaction with the current provincial 
 
BAGHDAD 00003620  002 OF 002 
 
 
government and a desire not to repeat the mistakes of the 
past by boycotting this election (NOTE:  Sunnis throughout 
Iraq largely boycotted the 2005 elections.  END NOTE). 
Election turnout is expected to be relatively high--between 
60-70 percent of the 730,000 eligible voters in Anbar.  The 
PRT believes that election preparations in Anbar are going 
smoothly.  END COMMENT.
