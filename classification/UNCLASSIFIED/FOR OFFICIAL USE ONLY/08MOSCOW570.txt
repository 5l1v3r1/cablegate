MECHANISM 
 
REF: SECSTATE 16195 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU)  We delivered reftel demarche to MFA International 
Organizations Senior Counselor Valentin Berezovskiy on 
February 29, who said that he would report the information 
and notify the Russian UN Mission about the decision. 
Berezovskiy told us that Russia maintained its long-standing 
position that all foreign troops in the DRC should be 
repatriated and was not opposed to the draft UNSC resolution, 
but expressed doubt that a resolution would have any more 
impact than existing Presidential Statements.  He was also 
concerned about the UNSC's will to support follow-up action 
if parties in the DRC did not respond to the resolution.
