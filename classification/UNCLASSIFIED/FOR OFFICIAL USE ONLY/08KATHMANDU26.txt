Designations Delivered to Foreign Ministry 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶1.  On January 3 and 7, Emboff delivered reftel information 
regarding the U.S. domestic designation of Syrian and 
Lebanese individuals to Mani Bhattarai, Section Officer for 
UN and International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA).  Bhattarai reviewed the information and said 
the MFA would inform post if it became aware of assets 
associated with these individuals. 
 
Central Bank Questions Relevance of Information 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2.  On January 7, Emboff delivered reftel information to 
Narayan Prasad Paudel, Director of Banks and Financial 
Institutions Regulation at Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the 
central bank of Nepal.  Paudel requested a formal diplomatic 
note from post or the Department for the NRB to use as a 
cover sheet to distribute the information to Nepal's banks 
and financial institutions.  The Rastra Bank office director 
also asked if the United States honestly believed these 
individuals' assets would be discovered in Nepal.  Emboff 
said the United States would appreciate any help Nepal's 
government and banks could provide. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶3.  The request by the NRB director, whom Emboff was meeting 
for the first time, for a diplomatic note came as a surprise. 
 Other, more junior, NRB officials -- including Poudel's 
deputy -- have responded positively to previous designations 
provided as non-papers.  Post will follow up with MFA 
contacts to address Rastra Bank's unusual reluctance to 
provide assistance.
