REF: STATE 102149 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1. (SBU) We discussed reftel issues on July 25 with Andy 
Rachmiato, Deputy Director for WMD Issues in the Directorate 
for International Security and Disarmament at the Indonesian 
Department of Foreign Affairs.  Rachmianto thanked us for the 
report on the U.S. ratification process and noted the United 
States was ahead of Indonesia in that process. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Rachmianto said Indonesia had participated in the 
negotiation of the convention and supported its adoption. 
Currently the government of Indonesia was reviewing relevant 
Indonesian legislation, he stated, including the 
counter-terrorism law passed in 2003, to determine what, if 
any, additional provisions would be necessary in order to 
adopt the convention and fully enforce it.
