     ¶B. STATE DEPT MEDIA NOTE MAY 4 (2009/415) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: The Forum for Security Cooperation 
supported its Georgian chair's letter to the Permanent 
Council endorsing the Annual Security Review Conference 
agenda, until recently the pretext of another 
Georgian-Russian disagreement.  Germany introduced 
Food-for-Thought papers on review of the OSCE Document on 
Small Arms and Light Weapons and on standards for briefings 
conducted during Vienna Document inspections.  Denmark 
proposed a meeting of heads of national verification centers 
in December 2009.  The UK will incorporate in a revised draft 
comments from delegations on a Best Practices Guide for 
Vienna Document contact visits.  Selection of a qualified 
bidder for the OSCE-Ukraine melange disposal project is 
almost complete.  End summary. 
 
ASRC Agenda 
----------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) A letter from the Georgian FSC chair to the 
Permanent Council chair recommending adoption of "something 
along the lines of" the agenda and modalities for the 2009 
Annual Security Review Conference (PC.DD/13/09/Rev.1) was 
endorsed by the FSC without discussion 
(FSC.DEL/105/09/Rev.1).  The FSC chef de file for the ASRC 
(Simonet, France) announced that a draft FSC "list of 
political-military elements" for the ASRC would be circulated 
May 8 for comment by FSC delegations (advance copy emailed to 
State VCI/CCA May 4). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Note:  Adoption of the ASRC agenda in the Permanent 
Council had been delayed by rancor between Georgia and Russia 
over language in the agenda referring to the August 2008 war. 
 Greece, the CiO, was able to broker compromise language: 
"developments since the 2008 ASRC, including in August 2008" 
that has been accepted by both countries and is contained in 
the draft decision on the agenda "recommended" by the FSC. 
End note. 
 
Food-for-Thought Papers 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Germany (Kantorczyk) announced a Food-for-Thought 
paper proposing guidelines for briefings by "military 
representatives and/or officers commanding formations" during 
inspections and evaluations under the Vienna Document 
(FSC.DEL/103/09).  Kantorczyk noted the proposal was 
mentioned at the 2008 Annual Implementation Assessment 
Meeting.  The paper will appear on the May 20 working group A 
agenda and proposes guidelines on the scope, structure, and 
content of the briefings to include location, purpose, 
identity and size of military units, relevant military 
activities, and equipment deployed.  Slovenia (Grabnar) 
supported the proposal and will co-sponsor. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The chair of the Informal Group of Friends on SALW 
(Schweizer, Germany) announced a Food-for-Thought paper 
(FSC.DEL/104/09) on a "possible way forward" in implementing 
the 2008 ministerial decision "to review the OSCE Document on 
SALW and its supplementary decisions with a view to explore 
further actions" (MC.DEC/11/08).  The paper will appear on 
the May 20 working group A agenda and proposes discussions 
 
USOSCE 00000119  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
during the current session of "principles" and "elements," 
such as implementation, for a review meeting held on or about 
September 22-23.  Also proposed is the development of: 
- normative framework on stockpile management; 
- normative framework on marking and tracing; 
- SALW export control criteria; and 
- standardized end-use certificates for the OSCE area. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Denmark (Petersen) announced a Food-for-Thought 
paper proposing a meeting of heads of national verification 
agencies (HOV) in December 2009 in conjunction with the data 
exchange (FSC.DEL/107/09).  The paper will appear on the May 
13 working group A agenda.  The paper suggests holding the 
HOV meeting in December will allow proposals made by the HOV 
to be further developed before the AIAM, normally held in the 
spring, and assumes consensus that an HOV meeting should be 
held. 
 
Quad Meeting on CSBMs 
--------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Germany (Kantorczyk) on the margins proposed to the 
U.S. (Neighbour) a Quad meeting on May 18 or 19 to discuss 
next steps on CSBM proposals, including the Vienna Document, 
at the FSC.  Kantorczyk said Allies need to take the 
initiative away from Russia by making their own proposals. 
He added that Quad Allies still hope to learn more of U.S. 
views of Russia's proposals for a limited revision of the 
Vienna Document.  Neighbour responded that he could not 
speculate when Washington would have a final view on this 
issue, but noted that a relevant question would be what 
specific changes to VD99 could benefit Allies.  Revision for 
its own sake would be unlikely to garner support. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Neighbour asked Kantorczyk if there was a reason 
that Allied proposals could not first be proposed in 
stand-alone CSBMs.  After a series of them were adopted, at 
that point it potentially could be appropriate for them to 
find a home in a limited revision of VD99.   Kantorczyk 
replied these were logical questions and emphasized that 
Germany wanted to work within the Alliance on CSBMs, and in 
the first instance, the Quad. 
 
Ukraine Melange 
--------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) The head of the Conflict Prevention Center (Salber) 
reported that selection of qualified bidders for the melange 
disposal project in Ukraine was nearing completion.  Review 
of the bids by an independent evaluation committee in March 
resulted in the elimination of two bidders as not technically 
qualified.  The remaining two bidders are now undergoing 
"post-qualification" evaluation, which includes environmental 
impact studies and due diligence investigations.  A written 
report will soon be distributed by the CPC. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Ukraine (Leschenko) thanked the OSCE, and announced 
the memorandum of understanding between the Ukraine and the 
OSCE had been "ratified" by its parliament.  The MOU includes 
terms on liability. 
 
Best Practices Guides 
--------------------- 
 
 
USOSCE 00000119  003 OF 003 
 
 
¶11. (SBU) The UK (Gare) reported she had received several 
comments on the draft Best Practices Guide on Vienna Document 
contact visits (FSC.AIAM/8/09) that will be reflected in a 
subsequent version of the guide.  The U.S. provided comments 
(ref A) earlier to Gare. 
 
SALW/Conventional Ammunition 
---------------------------- 
 
¶12. (SBU) The U.S. (Silberberg) announced the 
Department-hosted workshop in Zagreb, May 6-7, to develop a 
regional approach to stockpile reduction in South East Europe 
(ref B). 
 
Next Meeting 
------------ 
 
¶13. (SBU) The next meeting of the FSC will be on May 13 and 
will feature Security Dialogue presentations by Kenneth 
Pickles, OSCE stockpile security project coordinator in 
Moldova, and the deputy of the Tajikistan national security 
committee, General Kasym Gafarov, on border security.
