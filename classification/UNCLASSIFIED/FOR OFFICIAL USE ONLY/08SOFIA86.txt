REF: STATE 11499 
 
(SBU)  On February 6, we delivered REFTEL points and IAEA 
Deputy Director General for Safeguards Olli Heinonen's letter 
requesting additional information about the nuclear-related 
export denial information on Iran to MFA's Maria S. 
Atanassova, Head of the Export Control Section, Arms Control 
Department and Daniela Boudinova, State Expert on Nuclear 
Issues, Arms Control and International Security Department. 
Ms. Atanassova thanked us for Heinonen's letter and said that 
Bulgaria had a shared interest in the ongoing IAEA 
investigation into the Iranian Nuclear Program.  However, she 
was non committal on Bulgaria regarding the request to 
provide additional export denial information on Iran with the 
United States or IAEA.
