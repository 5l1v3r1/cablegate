90-100 truckloads on January 13.  Karni's conveyor belt and Nahal Oz

Crossings Update 
---------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) January 13:  Kerem Shalom crossing was open for an 
estimated 90-100 truckloads of humanitarian and commercial supplies, 
and 180,000 liters of industrial fuel for the power plant, according 
to UN and private sector contacts.  Rafah crossing was open to a 
limited amount of aid and medical cases.  The Karni conveyor belt 
and the Nahal Oz fuel transfer station were closed.  Gaza 
transportation sector contacts reported that Karni and Nahal Oz 
(which are close to one another) were closed because IDF forces 
uncovered a tunnel in the vicinity. 
 
¶3. (SBU) January 12:  OCHA contacts reported that 94 truckloads (51 
for humanitarian aid) entered Kerem Shalom.  The Karni conveyer belt 
was operational for the first time since December 26, and 27 
truckloads (grain and animal feed) entered through it.  Fourteen 
truckloads of medical supplies and 17 foreign doctors entered Rafah, 
and seven wounded Palestinians exited. 
 
Internal Movement 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) UN contacts confirmed a "humanitarian pause" occurred on 
January 13 from 0900 to 1200 local.  UNRWA reported hearing 
artillery fire during the lull.  ICRC contacts reported that their 
operations remained severely limited by coordination issues with the 
IDF.  They noted that they deliver essential supplies inside Gaza 
without prior coordination. 
 
¶5. (SBU) UNRWA reported on January 12 that coordination with COGAT 
has improved since UNRWA resumed distribution operations on January 
¶11. 
 
¶6. (SBU) USG Assistance:  On January 13, USAID-provided milk powder 
and blankets were distributed to families in need, primarily in 
Zaytun, Sha'af, and Shujaiyah.  USAID reported that its medical 
equipment and food supplies were received by the Al Ahli hospital in 
Gaza on January 13. 
 
Water and Sanitation 
-------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) According to the PA Ministry of Health, Gaza's Water 
Authority has been unable to provide water to Gaza homes because of 
ongoing hostilities.  ICRC reported significant damage at both the 
Gaza Wastewater Treatment Plant and the Beit Lahiya sewage lagoon. 
 
Fuel and Electricity 
-------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) USAID contractors in Gaza reported that thousands of Gaza 
City residents lost power following IDF attacks in central Gaza City 
on the morning of January 13.  Power plant contacts said that Gaza 
City's main high-voltage line was damaged by missile strikes.  The 
Gaza power plant is producing 32 MW output, and has enough fuel to 
produce electricity at this rate until January 16. 
 
¶9. (SBU) WHO contacts reported that electricity is flowing 
intermittently to hospitals (between 4-12 hours/day) and that 
hospitals have diesel supplies to operate generators.  OCHA contacts 
reported that ICRC is escorting technicians sent to repair 
transmission lines. 
 
¶10. (SBU) According to private sector contacts in Gaza, cooking gas 
remains in short supply.  While some 200 tons of cooking gas is on 
the Gaza side of Nahal Oz, Palestinian truckers have not been able 
to collect fuel from Nahal Oz in recent days due to the security 
situation. 
 
Medical/Evacuation Update 
------------------------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) ICRC contacts reported that ICRC focused on evacuating 
wounded citizens from Zaytun and Beit Lahiya on January 12-13.  ICRC 
President Kellenberger toured Palestinian Red Crescent Society 
operations and Al Shifa hospital in Gaza City on January 13.  (Note: 
 
JERUSALEM 00000127  002 OF 002 
 
 
 ICRC contacts report, based on Kellenberger's visit, that the 
situation on the ground is "far too volatile" to attempt an 
evacuation of Amcits and other third country nationals at this time. 
 End Note.) 
 
Food 
---- 
 
¶12. (SBU) UNRWA contacts said January 12 that the population of Gaza 
"is receiving only a fraction of what it needs."  OCHA contacts 
maintained that 90 percent of Gaza's population depends on food 
assistance.  UNRWA distributed food from seven out of its 10 
distribution sites to approximately 15,000-20,000 people on January 
¶13. 
 
¶13. (SBU) WFP reported that it could access only about 50 percent of 
its food stocks in Gaza because of security concerns.  WFP 
warehouses currently store an estimated 3,500 metric tons of food 
commodities (50 percent of storage capacity), enough to feed WFP's 
caseload of 360,000 recipients for up to three weeks. 
 
Displacement and Shelters 
------------------------- 
 
¶14. (SBU) UNRWA reported that, as of January 13, it was operating 38 
shelters for more than 35,000 displaced people.  The UN estimates 
that 20,000 residents have left Rafah in recent days because of 
Israeli airstrikes. 
 
Cash 
---- 
 
¶15. (SBU) The GOI reportedly revoked its approval of UNRWA's request 
to transport USD 20 million into Gaza to pay UNRWA suppliers and 
employee salaries.  In addition, the GOI has not approved the 
Palestine Monetary Authority's request to transport NIS 243 million 
and USD 16 million to Gaza banks to pay PA salaries and hardship 
cases, according to the PMA.  A Gaza contact reported that cash 
shortages and bank closures and are exacerbating families' food, 
fuel, and water needs, as prices of basic commodities continue to 
rise.
