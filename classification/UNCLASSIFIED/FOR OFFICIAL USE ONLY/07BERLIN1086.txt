SUBJECT: IMPLEMENTING UNSCR 1747: GERMANY NOTIFIED ABOUT 
ADVOCATING A BROAD DEFINITION OF "ARMS AND RELATED MATERIEL" 
 
REF: STATE 67462 
 
¶1. (SBU) Global Affairs officer discussed May 24 reftel with 
Christof Pollmeier, deputy office director of the German 
MFA's Arms Export Control Division.  Pollmeier said the 
German Government fully complies with UNSCR 1747 and the EU 
Regulations enacted to ensure that all EU member states 
implement the resolution.  Pollmeier said the German 
Government prohibits the sale of all arms and military 
equipment to Iran, even though the German Government has not 
necessarily adopted the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List 
as its guideline to define "arms and related materiel."  The 
German Government requires that all German exporters apply 
for licenses to export any arms or military-related goods to 
Iran, and then the government denies the licenses in these 
cases, according to Pollmeier.  He noted that, thanks to the 
government's outreach efforts, German firms know not to 
export arms to Iran without applying for a license first, 
although the possibility exists for some firms to try to 
circumvent the export controls.  Nevertheless, the German 
Government remains vigilant to prevent the export of any kind 
of arms and related materiel to Iran, Pollmeier said. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Concerning Germany's report to the UN on 
implementing UNSCR 1747, due May 24, Pollmeier said the 
German Government was still working on it but was close to 
finalizing it. 
 
¶3. (U) Post will report any other substantive German response 
septel.
