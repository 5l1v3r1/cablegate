¶1. (SBU) Summary. The Mission's Naval Medical Research Unit 
(NAMRU-2) confirmed three new human AI cases, two of whom have died. 
 These are the first new human AI cases in Indonesia since November 
12 2006.  USAID/Jakarta took delivery of 100,000 sets of personal 
protective equipment (PPE) and 1000 decontamination kits.  Dr Rodney 
Hoff from the REDI Center in Singapore will visit Jakarta from 14-17 
January to meet with Government of Indonesia (GOI) officials 
involved in AI management and preparedness. End Summary. 
 
NAMRU-2 Human AI Case Profile 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) NAMRU-2 reports three new cases of human H5N1 infection, 
the first such cases since November 12 2006.  Two of the infected 
individuals have died: a 14-year-old male, who died on January 10, 
and a 37-year-old female, who died on January 11.  The third case, a 
22-year old female, is still alive.  All three are from the Jakarta 
suburb of Tangerang. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The two subjects who died are not related and the 
infection does not seem to have a common source. The 14-year old 
developed symptoms on December 31 and was admitted to the hospital 
on January 4.  The 37-year old developed symptoms on  January 1 and 
was hospitalized on January 6.  Unconfirmed reports imply that both 
subjects were in contact with dead or dying ducks (14/M) or chickens 
(37/F).  The case is of clinical interest in that the male patient 
showed evidence of diarrhea, not a common symptom of H5N1 infection 
among Indonesian patients.  Additionally, rectal swabs taken because 
of the diarrhea symptoms from the male patient showed H5N1.  The 
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 
the 14-year old and 37-year old patients with H5N1 infection.  Five 
people showed symptoms after exposure with the two confirmed cases, 
including a nurse who treated the male, and have been tested for 
H5N1.  NAMRU-2 has tested samples and confirmed that all are H5N1 
negative, although one had evidence of an H1 virus.  Evaluation of 
additional suspect cases from the Tangerang area is ongoing and 
NAMRU-2 is monitoring the situation closely. 
 
¶4. (SBU) NAMRU-2 data indicates the following AI-related case 
profile as of January 12: 
 
-- Number of laboratory confirmed (positive PCR and/or serology) 
human AI cases: 77, of which 59 have been fatal (case fatality rate 
of 78 percent). 
 
-- Number of probable AI cases: 3, of which 2 are fatal (case 
fatality rate of 67%). 
 
-- Number of cases awaiting analysis at the U.S. CDC: zero. 
 
-- Number of possible untested AI cases under investigation (last 30 
days): approximately two. 
 
Note: NAMRU-2 data corresponds with Ministry of Health (MOH) data 
but may vary at times with AI case figures presented on the official 
World Health Organization (WHO) website, which usually lags NAMRU-2 
data by one week.  The WHO website, last updated on January 9, notes 
76 human AI cases in Indonesia with 57 deaths.  For WHO figures, log 
onto their website at www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza. 
 
PPE Kits 
-------- 
 
¶5. (U) USAID has delivered 100,000 sets of personal protective 
equipment (PPE) and 1000 decontamination kits to Jakarta.  The PPE 
and decontamination kits are for use in both the implementation of 
USAID-funded AI programs to protect GOI, NGO, and program staff and 
others in contact with the virus and also for responding to animal 
and human outbreaks.  As stock expends, USAID will send additional 
kits to meet its commitment of supplying 200,000 PPE and 2000 
decontamination kits.  A 30-day supply of PPE will be held in 
reserve in Jakarta for the GOI/KOMNAS to access in emergency 
situations. 
 
Visit by Dr Rodney Hoff, REDI, Singapore 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Dr. Rodney Hoff from the Regional Emerging Diseases 
Investigation (REDI) will visit Jakarta January 14-17 to meet with 
GOI officials dealing with AI management including Dr. Tri Satya 
Putri Naipospos, Secretary to the National Committee on Avian 
Influenza Control and Pandemic Preparedness (KOMNAS).  Dr Hoff will 
attend an informal meeting on the Tangerang project, organized by 
Dr. Naipospos.  The Embassy had hoped to send a representative to 
the meeting, but the GOI has announced that the meeting will not be 
open to U.S. or Singapore government personnel.  However, we 
understand that the Indonesians are planning to hold a Tangerang 
Trilateral meeting in early February 2007 involving us and the 
Singaporeans.
