SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Department announces the availability 
of funds for programs to support civil society, human rights, 
and rule of law in Iran.  The Iran small grants program is an 
opportunity for posts to strengthen their contacts with the 
Iranian diaspora and advance the U.S. goal of supporting 
democratic reform in Iran.  Interested posts should encourage 
appropriate local NGOs and other organizations to submit 
proposals that fit within the parameters described below. 
Deadline for the first round grant applications is April 11; 
deadline for the second round is July 18.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------- 
SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM ) WHAT IT IS 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Office of Iranian Affairs (NEA/IR) has funds 
available for small grants at addressee posts to support 
civil society, human rights, and rule of law in Iran.  The 
small grants program is designed to support programs that: 
 
-- strengthen the capacity of Iranian civil society 
organizations; 
 
-- promote human rights, labor rights, and personal freedoms 
for Iranians; 
 
-- expose members of Iranian society, particularly Iranian 
youth, to democratic ideas and processes; 
 
-- increase public awareness and involvement in current 
political issues, including voter education and building 
advocacy skills among individuals and groups; 
 
-- promote freedom of information, including unrestricted 
access to the Internet; 
 
-- encourage women and minorities, participation in public 
life; 
 
-- promote transparency and anti-corruption; 
 
-- promote the rule of law and legal and judicial reforms; 
 
-- encourage education and awareness of international 
economic practices. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Broader cultural or academic activities can be 
considered for funding as long as they have an element 
related to civil society, human rights, or rule of law.  An 
example would be an academic conference on Iran and host 
country relations that would also address academic standards. 
 Short-term student exchanges administered through private or 
public universities dealing with cross-cultural or 
interdisciplinary topics in the social sciences would also be 
appropriate. 
 
 
STATE 00033385  002 OF 003 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Successful existing programs address issues related 
to democratic reform in a phased, low-profile manner, and 
build on organizations, existing ties in Iran.  For example, 
a successful conference on human rights addressed family law 
reform in a comparative Islamic context.  Another successful 
conference on women,s rights invited women from across the 
region to talk about their common experiences.  Programs that 
connect Iranian NGOs, including social, health, and 
environmental NGOs, to their counterparts outside the country 
are welcome. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
POSTS, AND DEPARTMENT,S RESPONSIBILITIES 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) While the Department encourages posts to 
participate, this is a voluntary program that posts should 
consider as a resource.  Posts may either reach out to 
specific NGOs or universities and encourage them to submit 
applications, or have them submit applications on an ad hoc 
basis. Posts will be the point of contact for potential award 
recipients and should work with them to develop proposals. 
NEA/IR developed small grants with political officers at 
selected posts, but grants are managed in coordination with 
posts, public affairs section.  Post liaison officers should 
contact NEA/IR (see para 12) for guidance. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Post should ensure applications meet the criteria 
for consideration before forwarding them to NEA.  Upon 
favorable review, post should send any application 
recommended for funding by cable and email for NEA review and 
final approval.  NEA staff will ensure no duplication of 
existing programs, compliance with USG policy, and offer 
final approval within three weeks of each deadline.  For the 
purposes of Congressional and intergovernmental (OFAC 
licensing) requirements and reporting, NEA/IR retains final 
authority over the award of funds.   Once the Department has 
approved a grant application, NEA/IR will provide a standard 
terms and conditions document that can be adapted for 
individual grantees. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Post PAOs, CAOs, or grant officers will sign these 
grants.  NEA will provide posts with award fund cites as soon 
as possible.  Posts must develop a statement of work with the 
grantee that will become part of the grant agreement once the 
Department approves the award.  Awardees may have up to two 
years to expend funds.  Department defers to post discretion 
on informing host country government officials of USG funding 
of Iran-related activities in-country. 
 
------------------ 
PROGRAM GUIDELINES 
------------------ 
 
¶8. (SBU) NEA will allocate $500,000 to fund approved projects 
by local and third country NGOs that address the above-noted 
priorities.  Posts should contact NEA/IR for a copy of the 
grant application form and detailed instructions for 
potential grantees. 
 
¶9. (SBU) In general, grants should fund discrete events such 
as conferences or one-off training seminars.  Organizations 
with ideas for programs with long timelines should apply 
directly to NEA/IR for funds. Individual awards may vary from 
$5,000 up to $100,000.  Any organization interested in a 
larger grant should apply directly to NEA/IR.

¶10. (SBU) While this program is not classified, we encourage 
limiting discussion of the program to potential grantees and 
host governments, rather than advertising via the local 
media. 
 
-------- 
DEADLINE 
-------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) Posts should forward recommended proposals to NEA 
no later than the designated dates for submission: the first 
deadline is April 11 and the second is July 18.  The first 
deadline is meant for posts with projects pending approval 
that did not receive FY 2006 funding.  The second deadline is 
for posts interested in developing new projects.
