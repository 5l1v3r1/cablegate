SUBJECT: TSA OFFICIALS DISCUSS AVIATION SECURITY WITH 
GERMAN INTERIOR AND TRANSPORTATION MINISTRIES 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  In meetings with German Interior and 
Transportation officials December 19, TSA representatives 
pushed for more access by USG inspectors to Germany's 
airports and to air carriers that fly to the U.S.  The TSA 
reps also voiced concerns about Germany's failure to 
re-screen carry-on baggage of passengers transiting Germany 
en route to the U.S. whose carry-on items have been screened 
at an airport of another EU Member State.  The German side 
cited resource and manpower constraints as the factors that 
have limited access USG inspectors' access, and suggested 
that the U.S. agree to participate in joint inspections with 
EU personnel.  On the issue of re-screening carry-on baggage, 
the German officials asked that the USG place greater trust 
in the EU's concept of "one-stop security," i.e., that 
screening in any EU airport obviates the need for 
re-screening.  TSA reps cited U.S. regulations that required 
re-screening and indicated we would have very limited 
flexibility on this issue.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) 
Director for Stakeholder Liaison Victoria Reeder met with 
officials from the German Interior and Transportation 
Ministry December 19 to review airport and airline security 
issues, with a particular emphasis on mandatory assessments 
of German airports and inspections by USG personnel of 
airlines that fly from Germany to the U.S.  The German 
delegation was led by Dietmar Marscholleck, Interior Ministry 
Director for Aviation Security, and Joerg Mendel, 
Transportation Ministry Director for Aviation Security. 
Reeder was accompanied by TSA Country Representative and 
Global Affairs Counselor. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Reeder first raised the issue of air carrier 
inspections, noting USG personnel have at times encountered 
difficulties in scheduling mandatory inspections of non-U.S. 
flag carriers that operate out of German airports.  Reeder 
pointed out that air carrier inspections were distinct from 
airport assessments and were mandated by U.S., rather than 
international, legal requirements. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Marscholleck replied by recalling that the EU as a 
whole has been discussing the issues of airport assessments 
and air carrier inspections with the U.S.  Bilateral 
discussions on these issues must complement the ongoing 
U.S.-EU dialogue, he said.  On the issue of USG inspections 
of non-U.S. flag carriers, Marschollek argued that to allow 
the U.S. to conduct inspections as requested would stretch 
German resources too thinly and would also open the door to 
requests from other governments to inspect all air carriers 
that fly to their respective countries.  Noting that the EU 
regularly conducted its own inspections, he suggested that 
the U.S. consider participating in joint inspections with EU 
personnel.  He also proposed increased data-sharing between 
Germany and the U.S. with respect to the results of 
inspections carried out by Germany. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Reeder welcomed the possibilities for enhanced 
information exchange, but voiced concerns about the 
appropriateness of joint U.S.-EU inspection teams.  She 
reminded the German side that USG security enforcement 
criteria are often more stringent than the standards applied 
by the EU.  She also stressed that TSA was obligated by U.S. 
law to carry out inspections in accordance with U.S. 
requirements and procedures.  The TSA has very little 
flexibility in this regard. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Marscholleck next raised the issue of re-screening 
carry-on luggage that transits airports only within the EU. 
He argued that the U.S should accept the EU policy of 
"one-stop security" that considers a one-time screening of 
carry-on luggage at any EU airport sufficient, provided that 
passengers transit only through approved airport security 
zones prior to their onward travel to the U.S.  Mendel 
posited that the USG might not be sufficiently familiar with 
EU screening procedures, and suggested more TSA access to EU 
screening teams -- or even the integration of TSA screeners 
into EU teams -- as measures that would help allay U.S. 
security concerns.  Reeder replied that while the USG might 
be satisfied with screening procedures at most airports in 
Germany, we did not consider those procedures sufficient at 
all EU airports.  She stressed that TSA also has limited 
flexibility in this case, since the requirements to re-screen 
carry-on baggage are statutory. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) In response to a question from TSA Country Rep as 
to whether Germany would consider allowing air carriers to 
contract a commercial security firm to conduct the 
re-screening required by USG regulations, Marschollek said 
 
BERLIN 00000080  002 OF 002 
 
 
Germany would continue to rely exclusively on official 
government personnel.  He reiterated his request that the USG 
place greater trust in German security practices and 
procedures.  Reeder undertook to consider the German 
proposals, but reiterated that the statutory nature of TSA 
security-related procedures and requirements placed 
considerable constraints on TSA flexibility.
