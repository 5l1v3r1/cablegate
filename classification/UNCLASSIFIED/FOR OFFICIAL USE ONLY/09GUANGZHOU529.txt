SUBJECT: Guangdong Vice Governor Wan Advised of Visits by Commerce 
Secretary and Ambassador 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On September 2, the Consul General informed 
Guangdong Vice Governor Wan Qingliang that U.S. Commerce Secretary 
Locke and the Ambassador would visit Guangzhou to attend the Pearl 
 
River Delta (PRD) Forum on Innovation and Intellectual Property (IP) 
October 26-27 and that the Ambassador also plans to break ground for 
the new consulate compound (NCC).  Vice Governor Wan promised 
assistance in preparing for the visits and in setting up a meeting 
with Guangdong Party Secretary Wang Yang.  END SUMMARY. 
Further Cooperation Built on Solid Ground 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Consul General Goldbeck used his initial courtesy call with 
Vice Governor Wan on September 2 to confirm the Commerce Secretary 
and Ambassador's intention to visit for the PRD Forum on Innovation 
and IP jointly sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the South 
China American Chamber of Commerce, and the Guangdong Intellectual 
Property Office.  The CG requested assistance from the Guangdong 
Foreign Affairs Office to help with visit preparations and to 
arrange a meeting with Guangdong Party Secretary Wang Yang.  The CG 
noted that during his visit the Ambassador also plans to break 
ground for the NCC, reflecting the USG's commitment to the bilateral 
relationship. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The CG and Wan then both expressed a desire to increase 
cooperation and build on the already strong relationship shared by 
the United States and Guangdong province, and to further the solid 
relationship developed by the Consul General's predecessor, then CG 
and now DCM Goldberg. Wan several times noted that he had enjoyed 
very close ties with the CG and Consulate, and he hoped to build on 
this solid foundation. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The CG stressed that the Consulate will work hard to expand 
cooperation in south China.  This will mean continued facilitation 
of people-to-people exchanges through travel to the United States as 
well as closer economic ties.  He noted that the Consulate officers 
accompanying him reflected the range of areas in which the Consulate 
hopes to develop closer ties, from trade, investment and travel to 
education and culture.
