Canada Expresses Concern Over Nicaraguan Elections 
 
The Government of Canada expressed its concern over the 
incidence of violence, lack of national electoral observers 
and lack of transparency during the November 9th municipal 
elections in Nicaragua. 
 
Reports of intimidation, irregularities in voting procedures 
and counting on Sunday, as well as the violence which 
followed, resulting in loss of life, are particularly 
worrisome.  The barring of independent observers during the 
election, which is critical to ensuring a transparent 
electoral process, is of particular concern. 
 
Canada joins the Organization of American States, the 
European Union, and the United States in their statements of 
concern over the election. 
 
Canada urges all parties to work openly and peacefully toward 
a just solution to the situation.  It also strongly urges the 
Government of Nicaragua to uphold the principles of the 
Inter-American Democratic Charter and to ensure that the 
election results reflect the will of Nicaraguans.  Canada 
actively promotes free and fair democratic processes in the 
Americas and strongly encourages consideration of proposals 
made by Nicaraguan civil society and religious leaders for 
re-assessing existing results with independent domestic and 
foreign observers.
