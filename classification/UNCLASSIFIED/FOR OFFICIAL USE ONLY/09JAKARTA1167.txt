Please handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Indonesian Ministry of Health 
wants to expand health cooperation with the United 
States.  Towards this end, they have presented us 
with a draft MOU that outlines a broad framework for 
our health relationship.  This MOU will be the 
subject of discussion during the July 13-16 
interagency health visit to Jakarta.  A joint 
Indonesia-United States Medical Research Center-to 
replace NAMRU-will be the key initiative that we can 
launch under that framework.  END SUMMARY. 
 
INDONESIA OPEN TO A DEEPER RELATIONSHIP 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Indonesian Ministry of Health (MOH) 
wants to establish a framework for expanded health 
cooperation with the United States.  Toward that end, 
senior MOH officials have provided us with a draft 
MOU on health cooperation.  (The text of the MOU is 
in paragraph six below.)  The MOU outlines a broad 
but somewhat unfocused vision of collaboration in 
medical research, public health, emerging diseases 
and other areas.  Given past difficulties over health 
issues, Indonesia's openness to deeper health 
cooperation is an important opportunity.  We should 
seize it. 
 
NAMRU IS CRITICAL 
 
¶4.  (SBU) For any broader health cooperation to 
succeed, we must address the immediate issue of 
NAMRU's status.  Mission has already provided MOH 
officials with preliminary ideas on transforming 
NAMRU into an Indonesian-American Medical Research 
Center.  That Center would incorporate NAMRU's 
existing facilities and personnel into a new joint 
facility with bi-national leadership.  Because of 
NAMRU's significant presence on the ground and 
decades of successful work in Indonesia, whatever 
facility eventually succeeds it must constitute the 
centerpiece of any future health cooperation.  The 
GOI MOU does not specifically discuss NAMRU or its 
successor.  However, key elements of text seem to 
reflect GOI receptivity to a joint research facility. 
We believe this offers an opportunity to move forward 
on NAMRU at the same time that we establish a broader 
framework for health cooperation. 
 
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The Indonesian draft MOU represents an 
opportunity to move our health relationship forward 
and will be a key subject of discussion for the July 
13-16 interagency health delegation visit to Jakarta. 
Certain elements of the text are problematic, 
including those on vaccine production, material 
transfer agreements and intellectual property rights. 
However, these are not fatal flaws.  We believe that 
the Indonesians are genuinely open to improved health 
cooperation.  Next week's visit is an opportunity to 
seize on that Indonesian interest and forge a broader 
framework for health cooperation.
