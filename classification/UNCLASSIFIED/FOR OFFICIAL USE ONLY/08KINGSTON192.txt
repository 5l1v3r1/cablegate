Government of Jamaica (GoJ)'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Foreign Trade (MFAFT): 
 
(begin text of GoJ diplomatic note no. 358/803/3) 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
" The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign trade presents its 
compliments to the Embassy of the United States of America and has 
the honor to refer to its note No. 045/08 dated 20 February 2008, 
requesting the Government of Jamaica to allow entry to Jamaica of a 
Cuban migrant who is being held in protective custody at the US 
Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay and who is on a hunger strike, in 
order that he may be provided with medical treatment, in the event 
of such a need. 
 
The Ministry wishes to advise the Embassy that it has given careful 
consideration, particularly in the light of the humanitarian issues 
raised, to the request for assistance.  However, the Government of 
Jamaica regrets that, due to existing international obligations, it 
is not in a position to accommodate this request. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade avails itself of 
this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the United States of 
America the assurances of its highest consideration.
