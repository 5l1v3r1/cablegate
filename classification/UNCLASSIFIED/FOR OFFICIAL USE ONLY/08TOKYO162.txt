Airport to Hotel Transportation

¶4.  (U)  Visitors should take the airport "limousine" bus 
directly to the hotel or the Narita Express (NEX) train to 
Tokyo Station and then a taxi to the hotel.  The limousine 
bus counter is located in the Tokyo Narita Airport Arrival 
lobby.  Look for the orange signs as you walk through the 
doors from the customs area to the main lobby.  The bus fare 
is 3,000 Yen.  The NEX train is located in the basement of 
the airport terminal.  The train fare is 2,900 Yen. 
Twenty-four hour currency exchange facilities are available 
in the customs area and the arrival lobby of the airport. 
Travel time from Tokyo Narita Airport to downtown Tokyo is 
90-120 minutes, depending on traffic. 
 
---- 
Visa 
---- 
 
¶5.  (U) Holders of U.S. diplomatic or official passports must 
have a Japanese visa to enter Japan.  Travelers on a U.S. 
tourist passport may enter Japan as a tourist without a 
Japanese visa for up to 90 days.  As of November 20, 2007, 
all foreign nationals entering Japan, with the exemption of 
certain categories, are required to provide fingerprints and 
a facial photograph at the port of entry.  This requirement 
does not replace any existing visa or passport requirements. 
Official U.S. travelers will have to submit to the photograph 
and fingerprinting requirement unless they travel with a 
valid diplomatic or official visa or a Note Verbale.  The 
nature of the passport onto which the visa is pasted is not 
relevant, i.e. a tourist passport holder with a diplomatic or 
official visa will not have to submit to the biometrics 
collection process.  SOFA personnel are exempt under SOFA 
Article 9 (2) from the new biometrics entry requirements.

Embassy Laptop Policy 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Official visitors are reminded tQt personally owned 
or non-controlled USG-issued electronic equipment (including 
all PDAs, cell phones, pagers, radios, records) may not enter 
the controlled access areas.  Additionally, all classified 
and sensitive materials must be secured at the embassy visit 
control office upon arrival in country. 
 
----------------- 
Threat Assessment 
----------------- 
 
¶7.  (U) U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain at a 
heightened state of alert.  As the U.S. Government has 
reported in public announcements over the last several 
months, U.S. citizens and interests abroad may be at 
increased risk of terrorist actions from extremist groups, 
which may target civilians and include suicide operations. 
The Department maintains information about potential threats 
to Americans overseas which is available to travelers on the 
internet at the Bureau of Consular Affairs home page: 
http://www.travel.state.gov.  The Embassy takes all threats 
seriously.  U.S. Embassy Tokyo can be contacted 24 hours a 
day at 03-3224-5000 (locally) or 81-3-3224-5000 
(internationally). 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The general threat from crime in Tokyo and 
throughout Japan is low.  Crime is at levels well below the 
U.S. national average.  Violent crime is rare, but does 
exist.  The Japanese National Police report continued 
problems with pick-pocketing of foreigners in crowded 
shopping areas of Tokyo.  Although street crime is low, 
common sense security measures are advised for all American 
citizens traveling in Japan. 
 
¶9.  (U) Also be advised that under no circumstances may 
weapons be brought into Japan.  Carrying a pocketknife 
(including Swiss Army-style knife, craft or hunting knife, 
box cutter, etc.) in public is forbidden.  Under Japanese 
law, carrying any such item in public, with a size exceeding 
8 cm in length, 1.5 cm in width or 2 mm in thickness, can 
subject the person to arrest or detention.
