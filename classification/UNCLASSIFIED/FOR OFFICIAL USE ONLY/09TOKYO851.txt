Airport to Hotel Transportation 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U)  Visitors should take the airport "limousine" bus 
directly to the hotel or the Narita Express (NEX) train to 
Tokyo Station and then a taxi to the hotel.  The limousine 
bus counter is located in the Tokyo Narita Airport Arrival 
lobby.  Look for the orange signs as you walk through the 
doors from the customs area to the main lobby.  The bus fare 
is 3,000 Yen.  The NEX train is located in the basement of 
the airport terminal.  The train fare is 2,900 Yen. 
Twenty-four hour currency exchange facilities are available 
in the customs area and the arrival lobby of the airport. 
Travel time from Tokyo Narita Airport to downtown Tokyo is 
90-120 minutes, depending on traffic.

Visa 
---- 
 
¶5.  (U) U.S. citizens entering or transiting Japan on 
official business must obtain a diplomatic or official visa 
for that purpose.  U.S. citizens traveling with a valid U.S. 
passport can enter Japan for business or pleasure for up to 
90 days without a visa.  All foreign nationals entering 
Japan, with the exemption of certain categories, are required 
to have their fingerprints scanned and a facial photograph 
taken at the port of entry.  This requirement does not 
replace any existing visa or passport requirements.  U.S. 
travelers on official business must have a diplomatic or 
official visa specifying the nature of travel as "AS 
DIPLOMAT," "AS OFFICIAL," or "IN TRANSIT" to be exempt from 
biometric collection.  All other visa holders, including 
those with diplomatic and official visas stating "AS 
TEMPORARY VISITOR," are subject to this requirement. 
Passport type is also irrelevant.  In rare instances, 
official travelers who bring a Note Verbale specifying they 
are entering Japan in an official capacity may be exempted 
from the biometric collection requirement, if otherwise 
required.  SOFA personnel are exempt under SOFA Article 9 (2) 
from the new biometrics entry requirements.

Embassy Laptop Policy 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) The Embassy's electronic device (i.e. laptop, 
removable storage, video equipment, test equipment, etc.) 
policy states that absolutely no personal, non-government 
owned electronic devices may enter the Embassy.  Absolutely 
no equipment, even government-owned, may be connected to the 
Embassy network in any way without prior approval.  TDY 
employees are reminded that even government-owned equipment 
may not enter the Embassy without prior RSO approval. 
Absolutely no electronic device, even government-owned, may 
enter the CAA unless special pre-approval is given by the 
RSO, based on a compelling business need.  Please be advised 
that if the traveler does not have one of the following 
BlackBerry models and a service contract with one of the 
telecommunications companies (listing follows), then his/her 
BlackBerry will not work in Japan.  Japan has the most 
advanced cellular industry in the world and BlackBerry 
protocols are not as advanced as what are being used in Japan 
today.  (BlackBerry models: 8707G, H, V or U.S. 
Telecommunications Companies with a NTT/DoCoMo roaming 
agreement: Sprint/Nextel, ATT/Cingular, and T-Mobile)If you 
would like to bring a U.S. government-owned electronic device 
into the Embassy, please contact the RSO office (provide 
make, model, serial number, and purpose) prior to your visit 
for a briefing and approval. 
 
----------------- 
Threat Assessment 
----------------- 
 
¶7.  (U) U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain at a 
heightened state of alert.  As the U.S. Government has 
reported in public announcements over the last several 
months, U.S. citizens and interests abroad may be at 
increased risk of terrorist actions from extremist groups, 
which may target civilians and include suicide operations. 
The Department maintains information about potential threats 
to Americans overseas which is available to travelers on the 
internet at the Bureau of Consular Affairs home page: 
http://www.travel.state.gov.  The Embassy takes all threats 
seriously.  U.S. Embassy Tokyo can be contacted 24 hours a 
day at 03-3224-5000 (locally) or 81-3-3224-5000 
(internationally). 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The general threat from crime in Tokyo and 
throughout Japan is low.  Crime is at levels well below the 
U.S. national average.  Violent crime is rare, but does 
exist.  The Japanese National Police report continued 
problems with pick-pocketing of foreigners in crowded 
shopping areas of Tokyo.  Although street crime is low, 
common sense security measures are advised for all American 
citizens traveling in Japan. 
 
¶9.  (U) Also be advised that under no circumstances may 
weapons be brought into Japan.  Carrying a pocketknife 
(including Swiss Army-style knife, craft or hunting knife, 
box cutter, etc.) in public is forbidden.  Under Japanese 
law, carrying any such item in public, with a size exceeding 
8 cm in length, 1.5 cm in width or 2 mm in thickness, can 
subject the person to arrest or detention.
