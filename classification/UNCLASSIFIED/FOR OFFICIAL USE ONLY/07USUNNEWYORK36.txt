¶1. (SBU) At a January 19 meeting with USUN Ambassador 
Sanders, United Nations Department of Political Affairs (DPA) 
Assistant Secretary-General Kalomoh requested U.S. assistance 
in engaging with the Chadian armed opposition when the UN's 
advance mission deploys to N'Djamena.  He said that the 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) had sent a 
letter to President Deby expressing its intention to deploy 
the advance mission (as authorized by the January 16 Security 
Council Presidential Statement contained reftel) and was not 
worried about cooperation with the GOC or with members of the 
unarmed opposition.  The "dilemma" the UN faced, according to 
Kalomoh, was in engaging the armed opposition, which he 
feared was being supported by Sudan.  He said he had already 
approached the French on January 17 for assistance in this 
regard and was now looking to the USG for help.  Ambassador 
Sanders agreed to relay the request to the Department. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kalomoh did not have much information to offer about 
the advance mission.  He said it had not yet been constituted 
but informed that DPKO would be at its helm; DPA's level of 
representation has not yet been specified.  Kalomoh added 
that some members of the UN Technical Assessment Mission, 
scheduled to return to Chad by January 22, would remain in 
country to join the advance mission to be based in N'Djamena 
with a liaison office in Bangui.  DPA is currently working to 
finalize a budget for the advance mission, which would 
require funding through the  Advisory Committee on 
Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ).  Kalomoh 
confirmed that DPA would be represented on the TAM.  A 
mandate has yet to be spelled out for the advance mission, 
but its goal would be to establish a political context for 
the eventual peacekeeping mission in Chad and Central African 
Republic. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ambassador Sanders encouraged Kalomoh to expand 
DPA's participation in the reconciliation process in Chad and 
to take advantage of the upcoming African Union Summit (which 
Kalomoh will attend) to highlight the need for political 
dialogue in Chad.
