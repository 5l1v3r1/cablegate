¶1.  (SBU) The Charge chaired on May 30 a meeting of the 
Embassy's Homeland Security Working Group (HSWG).  RSO, 
LEGAT, ORA, DEA, CONS, and ECPO attended. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) HSWG members welcomed visiting Homeland Security 
Advisor Frances Townsend and accompanying staff to the 
meeting and outlined the structure and functions of the 
group.  HSA Townsend briefed the HSWG on her objectives in 
visiting Egypt - to shore up counterterrorism and security 
ties with a key ally and to learn more about the issues and 
problems facing Egypt that could affect U.S. homeland 
security.  HSA Townsend expressed interest in the Embassy's 
activities and engagement of both the GOE and private 
Egyptians, noting in particular the importance of consular 
operations and the need to strike a balance between keeping 
an open door to foreign visitors and at the same time 
protecting the U.S. from those who would do it harm.  (HSA 
Townsend subsequently toured the consular section, meeting 
with visa officers "on the front line" and observing live 
interviews with applicants.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) ECPO briefed the HSWG on a Department cable 
instructing the Embassy to seek from the GOE more information 
on a list of terrorist suspects it recently provided to the 
UN 1267 committee (ref A).  While the USG welcomes the GOE's 
initiative in this regard, ECPO noted, Washington has 
determined that the submission will not make a significant 
contribution unless the GOE provides more complete 
information. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Consul General provided HSA Townsend and staff 
with an overview of Embassy Cairo's implementation of the 
Visas Viper program.  The Embassy has been consistently 
active in providing submissions for consideration by 
Washington agencies.  The Consul General reminded the group 
to remain alert for information that might be used in 
preparing new Viper entries.
