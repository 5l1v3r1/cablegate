SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Bilateral relations between China and Cuba are at 
their historic best, according to China's top legislator Wu 
Bangguo.  China and Cuba traded high level visitors this week 
as Wu visited Havana and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno 
Rodriguez visited Beijing to commemorate the 49th anniversary 
of relations between the socialist brethren.  The press 
reported that China agreed to USD 600 million in loans, 
credits, and grants, but it is unclear how much of it is new 
money versus a reiteration of past commitments (Ref A).  END 
SUMMARY 
 
------------ 
Wu in Havana 
------------ 
 
¶2.  (U) Wu Bangguo, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress and China's second highest ranking 
party official, arrived in Havana on September 1 to meet with 
his Cuban counterpart, Ricardo Alarcon, President of the 
Cuban National Assembly.  According to the press, Wu and 
Alarcon oversaw the signing of a series of agreements on 
September 2, including:  USD 260 million credit from the 
Chinese ExIm Bank for the purchase of 10 grain ships; USD 300 
million credit from the Chinese ExIm Bank for the 
continuation of an info-communications program and the 
implementation of a project to produce radio and television 
transmitters and satellite receptors; a new line of credit 
from the China-Caribbean Fund to invest in television and the 
modernization of Cuban ports; and USD 19 million dollars 
(nine million donated, nine million credit, and one million 
preferential line of credit) for investment projects to be 
identified by the Cubans.  The agreements, actually signed by 
Chinese Deputy Trade Minister Ma Xiu Hong and Cuban Council 
of Ministers Vice President Ricardo Cabrisas, also included 
the Chinese donation of 60 traffic lights and "high tech" 
office equipment for the Cuban National Assembly.  Finally, 
both sides agreed to evaluate the feasibility of cooperation 
on building a slaughter house and a fruit and vegetable 
canning factory in the eastern province of Guantanamo. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Wu visited with Cuban President Raul Castro later 
on September 2, and then reportedly had a two-hour 
conversation with former president (and still Communist Party 
leader) Fidel Castro on September 3.  According to the Cuban 
press, Wu and Fidel discussed bilateral relations, the 
financial downturn, and climate change.  Wu said bilateral 
relationship between the two countries was at its best point 
in history.  This talking point was repeated by both parties 
at various meetings.  Little to no substance from Wu's 
meetings with each Castro has surfaced.  Rather, the 
international press has mainly focused on the photo released 
from the meeting showing Fidel outside and dressed in regular 
civilian clothing, instead of his traditional track suit. 
Raul Castro escorted Wu and his delegation to the airport on 
September 3.  From Cuba, Wu was headed to The Bahamas 
September 3-6 and then Phoenix, Arizona on September 6 (Ref 
B) at the invitation of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Bruno in Beijing 
---------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Also from September 1-3, Cuban Foreign Minister 
Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla visited Beijing where he met with 
his counterpart Yang Jiechi, Vice President Xi Jinping, 
Council of State member Dai Bingguo, and Director of 
International Relations for the Chinese Communist Party Wang 
Jiarui.  No agreements were signed, and the official press 
agencies in both countries only highlighted a litany of 
mutual praise and support from all parties.  Rodriguez 
concluded his visit by delivering a speech to a conference at 
 
HAVANA 00000551  002 OF 002 
 
 
the Academy of Social Sciences on "Cuba: Native and Viable 
Socialism."  From China, Rodriguez traveled to North Korea 
September 3-5 to meet with Choe Thae Bok, secretary of the 
Central Committee of the Worker's Party, Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Pak Ui Chun, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim 
Hyong Jun.  The Cubans and North Koreans praised their 
historic ties and historic leaders.  According to North 
Korean official press, Rodriguez emphasized that the Cuban 
people are following with keen interest how the Korean people 
are foiling the moves of the U.S. imperialists for 
aggression, true to the military-first politics. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Following these meetings, Cuban Vice President 
Ricardo Cabrisas traveled to Beijing on September 6 to 
participate in the 22nd Session of the Intergovernmental 
Commission for economic and commercial relations and attend 
the Investment and Trade Fair in Xiamen September 8-9.  The 
Cuban press reported that Cabrisas would sign a memorandum of 
understanding on biotechnology cooperation with his Chinese 
counterparts.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Unlike the November Hu Jintao visit to Cuba (Ref 
A), this week's activities received relatively standard press 
coverage.  Very few details were published, and at least a 
few of the deals "negotiated" appear to be the continuation 
of previous agreements, in particular regarding 
telecommunications and ports.  Cuba's overall trade with 
China fell slightly in 2008 (from approximately USD 2.4 
billion to USD 2.1 billion), mostly due to the price of 
nickel.  However, China clearly remains at the forefront, 
along with Brazil, of Cuba's efforts to diversify its main 
partners (read: benefactors) outside of Venezuela.  END
