¶1. (SBU) The Polish Ambassador to UNESCO, Maria Wodzynska-Walicka, 
met with Ambassador Oliver yesterday afternoon, June 29th, to update 
her on the issue of the proposed name change of the 
Auschwitz-Birkenau Concentration Camp, which was expected to be 
raised during the upcoming World Heritage Committee (WHC) meeting in 
Vilnius July 8-16. 
 
¶2. (SBU) As of today, the situation is as follows:  The proposed 
draft decision, which has already been made public, and links 
together plans associated with management problems at Auschwitz and 
the proposed name change is obsolete. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Ambassador Wodzynska-Walicka, there will now 
be a new draft decision that simply calls for an international 
experts group to develop a new management plan, which should be 
ready for the 2007 WHC meeting. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Meanwhile, the issue involving the name change is still not 
resolved.  The Polish Ambassador said that the Polish Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Culture are planning to meet 
possibly today or tomorrow to discuss the proposed name change and 
make a decision about how to proceed. 
 
¶5. (SBU) There are currently two options:  One is that the name 
change issue will be formally raised in Vilnius and a decision will 
be requested in a year, pushing any decision back to the 2007 WHC 
meeting, at the earliest. The second possibility is that it will not 
be raised at all in Vilnius.  (Comment: According to the Israeli 
Ambassador, this the position preferred by the Israelis.  End 
comment.) 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Polish Ambassador will contact us and let us know when 
a decision is made.
