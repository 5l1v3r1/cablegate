¶2.  (SBU) On September 9, Econoff delivered reftel points on 
the EU's GI proposal in the TRIPS Council to Otavio 
Brandelli, IPR Division Chief in Brazil's Foreign Ministry. 
In a September 14 follow-up discussion, Brandelli said the 
GoB agrees entirely with the US points and that instructions 
would be sent to Brazil's delegation in Geneva to make 
similar points during the WTO Special Session on Geographical 
Indications on September 16. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Brandelli cautioned, however, that this coincidence 
of positions should not be misinterpreted as a sign that 
Brazil is joining the "anti-GI" group in the Council, as 
Brazil prefers to remain "independent."
