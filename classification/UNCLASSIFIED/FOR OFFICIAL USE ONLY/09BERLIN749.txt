¶1. (SBU) On June 16, 2009, post contacted Maren Lipps, 
Pakistan Desk Officer, German Ministry for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (BMZ), to express appreciation 
for Germany's pledge at the April 17 Tokyo Donors Conference 
and highlight the importance of donor pledges for the 
government of Pakistan's budget for the fiscal year 2009-2010 
(REF A).  Lipps said BMZ was unable to provide information on 
the exact distribution of the funds until after negotiations 
with the Pakistani government were complete later this month. 
 She added, however, that there would most likely be no 
budgetary support. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Points were also shared with contacts at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), but MFA views are still 
pending.  Post will send an update when additional 
information is available. 
 
¶3. (SBU) NOTE: Total German aid to Pakistan in 2009-2010 will 
likely reach 121 million euros, according to information 
previously provided by BMZ and MFA.  Accounting for some 90 
million of this total, BMZ's assistance focuses on four broad 
areas: 1) basic education; 2) primary healthcare, family 
planning, and tuberculosis control; 3) renewable energies and 
energy efficiency; and 4) democracy and civil society.  Most 
MFA assistance to Pakistan focuses on humanitarian aid, 
particularly in the North-West Frontier Provinces and the 
Federally Administered Tribal Areas.  This year the MFA will 
also commit funds for conflict easing and prevention 
projects.  Both BMZ and MFA contribute towards Pakistan's 
internally displaced persons (IDP) crisis (REF B).  END NOTE.
