SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA INTERESTED IN SIGNING NUCLEAR R&D 
AGREEMENT 
 
REF: A. PRETORIA 2494 
 
     ¶B. PRETORIA 317 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request - see paragraph 1. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post seeks a response from Department and DOE to 
the Reftel A request that USG and SAG Ministers of Energy 
sign the proposed "Agreement Between the Government of the 
United States of America and the Government of the Republic 
of South Africa for Cooperation in Research and Development 
in Nuclear Technology" at the IAEA annual meeting in Vienna 
September 17, after the GNEP Ministerial on September 16. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) DME Chief Director: Nuclear Tselio Maqubela told 
Economic Counselor and Minerals and Energy Officer on August 
27 that it was still the intention of the SAG to sign the 
nuclear R&D agreement at the Ministerial level in Vienna, 
noting there was already bilateral agreement on the text and 
spirit of the document.  However, he admitted that DME was 
still seeking inter-agency approval to obtain signing 
authority.  He directed his subordinates to follow up on the 
status, given the short time frame and the long period that 
the agreement has remained in the SAG interagency review. 
Maqubela promised to get back to us as soon as possible, 
saying that a decision should be made "by the end of the 
week." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Maqubela noted the competition between Westinghouse 
and French Areva for the contract for new nuclear plant 
construction expected to be awarded in spring 2008 and said 
the SAG would seek to be even-handed with any activities with 
the USG and the GOF.  He emphasized that in his view the SAG 
should be able to continue with projects already in the 
pipeline.  Maqubela warned that he would not be able to meet 
as often with USG officials as the award date approached, 
given his half-time position in the Ministry and his 
half-time position with state power company ESKOM.  As a 
result, he said he would try to resolve issues with the USG 
"before the end of the year."
