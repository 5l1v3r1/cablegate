REF: SECSTATE 201818 
 
(sbu) In response to reftel demarche, Foreign Affairs desk 
officer for Liberia Harsha Sirur told Econcouns on January 4 
that Canada would likely send a "low-level" embassy 
representative to the February 13-14 Liberia Partners Forum 
in Washington.  Sirur stated that Canada provides no funding 
to Liberia either through bilateral projects or via earmarks 
from Canada's multilateral account for Africa.  Although he 
stated that only a "major shift" in policy would likely 
change the funding situation, Sirur also said Canada is 
considering a UN Population Fund (UNFPA) request to support 
mapping and cartography work to prepare for Liberia's 2008 
census -- which would in turn support the 2010 Liberian 
elections.  Sirur said that the UNFPA approached the Canadian 
Embassy in Abidjian (which also covers Liberia) with the 
request in December.
