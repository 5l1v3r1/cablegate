¶1. (SBU) Afghan Minister of Commerce and Industries (MOCI) 
Wahidullah Shahrani told Coordinating Director for Development and 
Economic Affairs E. Anthony Wayne October 22 that the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs would transmit a formal letter by close of business 
that day inviting Pakistan to the fourth round of Afghanistan- 
Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) talks.  In addition, the 
MFA will attach the draft Terms of Reference (TOR) for the 
re-export/unauthorized trade study to the letter per Pakistan's 
request. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Shahrani said he spoke with Foreign Minister Spanta earlier 
October 22 regarding the MFA's delay in transmitting the GIRoA 
acceptance of the TOR.  Shahrani also dispatched his senior trade 
advisor to the MFA to facilitate the letter's transmission, with 
MOCI supplying the draft text.  The Commerce Ministry has proposed 
November 10-11 or November 17-18 in Kabul as possible dates for the 
fourth round of talks.  Shahrani said the MFA will transmit the 
letter both to the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul and the Afghan Embassy 
in Islamabad.  Embassy Kabul will notify Washington upon 
confirmation of transmission.
