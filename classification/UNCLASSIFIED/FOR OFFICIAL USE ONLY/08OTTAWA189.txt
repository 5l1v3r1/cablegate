¶1. (SBU) FM Bernier issued a statement February 4 in response 
to recent developments in Chad, which said:  "Canada strongly 
condemns the attacks by rebel groups in Chad and, in 
particular, in N'Djamena.  We join newly elected African 
Union President Jakaya Kikwete in expressing our deep concern 
with this attempt to overthrow the Chadian government by 
military means."  He urged all parties to resolve their 
differences through negotiations and to ensure full access to 
conflict areas by civilians aid workers. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to the Sudan Desk Officer at the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
(DFAIT), DFAIT's Director General for Africa separately 
conveyed many of the points in our demarche (reftel) to the 
Sudanese government when he visited Khartoum recently.  She 
said the Canada is also making clear to the Government of 
Sudan that it will not have improved relations with Canada 
absent fundamental changes in policy and better dealings with 
Canadian officials.  She thanked us for sharing our points 
and promised that Canada would continue to convey a strong 
message to Sudan on the issue of its involvement in Chad.
