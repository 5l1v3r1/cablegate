SUBJECT: INSTRUCTIONS FOR COSTA RICA DRAFT PRST ON ICC 
 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified - treat accordingly. 
 
¶1. ACTION REQUEST - Costa Rica has circulated the draft 
text of a Presidential Statement (PRST) in connection with 
the ICC Prosecutor's report pursuant to UNSCR 1593 on 
Darfur. USUN should explore with the Costa Ricans and 
others the option of returning to the text put forward by 
UKUN last December (in the form set forth below in para 4) 
as a basis for any PRST in connection with this report. 
If that is not feasible, USUN is instructed to raise 
concerns noted in para 2 during expert-level meetings and 
suggest changes (in brackets) in the text at para 3 
below. End Action Request. 
 
¶2. The Department is concerned that the Costa Rican draft 
is unfocused, risks needless and counter-productive 
debate, and would be difficult for the Council to adopt. 
Two possible options for dealing with the situation would 
be to return to the text of the PRST circulated by UKUN 
last December (but eventually withdrawn because of 
 
resistance from some Council members) as a far more 
realistic basis or discussions now; or, failing that, to 
adopt the changes set out in para 3 below. USUN should 
submit any texts developed by experts to the Department 
for inter-agency clearance. 
 
¶3. Costa Rican draft text with suggested emendations: 
 
Para 1. The Security Council welcomes the seventh report 
of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (the 
Court) on June 5, 2008, pursuant to its resolution 1593 
(2005). 
 
Para 2 should be deleted. If that is not feasible, we 
could accept the following: The Security Council (add: 
stresses the importance of ending impunity for serious 
violations of international humanitarian law as part of a 
comprehensive approach to seeking sustainable peace) 
(delete: recognizes that ending impunity is an essential 
component of a solution in Darfur in all its aspects - 
political, security, humanitarian and judicial). 
 
Para 3. The Security Council recalls resolution 1593 
(2005), in which, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter 
of the United Nations, it decided, inter alia, that the 
Government of Sudan and all other parties of the conflict 
in Darfur shall cooperate fully with and provide any 
necessary information to the International Criminal Court 
and the Prosecutor (add: pursuant to that resolution). 
(Note: This would mirror the language in OP-2 of UNSCR 
¶1593. The PRST needs to be clear that the obligation to 
cooperate we are talking about is the obligation under 
that resolution, and not any other obligation.) 
 
Para 4, (This paragraph, which is fundamentally 
off-message, should be deleted: The Security Council 
continues to encourage the Court, as appropriate and in 
accordance with the Rome Statute. to support international 
cooperation with domestic efforts to promote the rule of 
law, protect human rights and combat impunity in 
Darfur)(Note: We do not want this PRST to be suggesting 
that we are looking to Sudanese courts as a realistic 
alternative for dealing with the main problems of 
accountability for the atrocities in Darfur. We are not 
realistically looking to Sudanese courts.) 
 
Para 5. (Delete this paragraph: The Security Council 
recognizes that the continued commission of crimes is a 
concrete obstacle facing all actors engaged in helping the 
people of Darfur and notes that impunity fuels violence, 
and in turn hampers security and humanitarian efforts 
The Security ouncili underlines that enforcing the law can 
contribute to the creation of genuine conditions for peace 
and security.)(Note: If necessary, we would utilize the 
fallback language for paragraph 2 as a way to deal 
generally with this point.)
