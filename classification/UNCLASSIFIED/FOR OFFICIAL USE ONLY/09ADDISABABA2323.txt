SUBJECT: USAU: AFRICAN UNION UNDETERRED BY ATTACK ON AMISOM 
TROOPS IN MOGADISHU 
 
¶1. (U) The African Union Commission's Acting Head of the 
Peace and Security Department, El-Ghassim Wane, told 
international partners on September 25 that the African Union 
is keen to get the remaining three AMISOM battalions into 
Somalia by the end of the year, although he acknowledged that 
could be a tall order.  Other African states must "shoulder 
the burden."  Wane told ambassadors and other diplomats from 
donor countries that the troops need both lethal and 
non-lethal equipment to help them carry out their mission. 
"If you don't have sufficient lethal weapons, there isn't 
much you can do," Wane conceded, referring to those armed 
groups fighting the Somali Transitional Federal government. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Wane noted that the AU Commission continues to adapt 
AMISOM's mandate to the changing conditions in Mogadishu, but 
that any strengthening of the mandate would need to be 
accompanied by an upgrade in equipment used by the troops. 
(Comment: While the AU has not yet changed AMISOM's mandate, 
the AMISOM Force Commander and AU Commission leadership have 
periodically focused on different components and adjusted 
their interpretation of the existing mandate to adapt to 
changing battlefield conditions.  End Comment.)  Wane said he 
expects that in the next two weeks, the AU Commission will 
take a decision on whether to strengthen AMISOM's mandate. 
He said there would be risks associated with doing so.  The 
AU also continues to advocate strengthening of the political 
process, imposing sanctions on "spoilers," and establishing a 
naval blockade and other measures to stem the flow of arms 
and other support to Al-Shabaab. 
 
¶3. (U) With respect to the September 17 attack on AMISOM 
forces in Mogadishu, Wane gave a tally of the dead and 
injured, and stated that it was clear to the AU that foreign 
fighters were involved in the operation.  These foreign 
fighters see Somalia as "the battleground to carry out 
jihad."  In response to a question by USAU Ambassador Battle 
about the impact the attack had on Burundi's commitment to 
AMISOM, Wane replied that reports of calls for withdrawal of 
the Burundian contingent were linked to Burundi's forthcoming 
election.  The Burundian government remains very committed to 
the mission, Wane asserted.  AMISOM troop contributing 
countries and the AU agree that they need to make sure such 
attacks do not occur again, he said. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In response to a question about whether the AU 
agreed that Somalia was becoming another Afghanistan (in 
reference to a recent statement by EU Commissioner for 
Development and Humanitarian Aid Karel de Gucht), Wane said 
the statement was not reassuring and acknowledged that 
foreign fighters were coming to Somalia because it was a 
territory conducive to carrying out their activities.  He 
called for more intelligence sharing, more troop contributing 
countries from African, and more partner financial, 
equipment, and training support.  (Comment: The AU has 
requested U.S. logistical support for the fourth Burundian 
battalion that they have pledged in support of AMISOM, but 
this request remains unfulfilled.  With AU Chairperson Jean 
Ping due to meet with A/S Johnnie Carson in the coming days, 
this is an opportunity for the USG to make clear our intent 
to train, equip, lift, and sustain these AMISOM troops.  End 
Comment.)
