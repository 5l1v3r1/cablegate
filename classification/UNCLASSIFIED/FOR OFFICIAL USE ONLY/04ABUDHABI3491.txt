¶1.  (SBU)  We delivered ref a demarche September 22 (and followed 
up October 3), urging the UAEG to attend the Tokyo donors meeting 
on Iraq and to disburse their Madrid pledge as quickly as 
possible, to MFA U/S Abdullah Rashid Al-Noaimi.  Al-Noaimi said 
that the UAEG had received Japan's invitation to attend the 
conference and that it viewed Iraqi reconstruction as a high 
priority.  He said that the UAEG would send someone to represent 
it at the conference, but that it had not yet decided who. 
(Note:  On October 3, MFA told polchief that the UAEG had not 
decided who would represent the UAE.  End note) 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In February, Al-Noaimi had said that the UAEG had 
disbursed its $215 million Madrid pledge in humanitarian 
assistance and by purchasing generators for the Iraqis. 
Econchief followed up with MFA Assistant U/S for International 
Cooperation Mohammed Abdul Jaleel, on September 27, to find out 
the disposition of the generators, since -- to the best of our 
knowledge -- they have not been delivered to Iraq, due to a lack 
of funds to transport and install them.  Abdul Jaleel promised to 
check on the disposition of the generators.  He added that these 
should be delivered to Iraq, since they were not doing anyone any 
good in the UAE.  He also said that he believed that UAE had 
already exceeded its Madrid pledge in providing assistance to 
Iraq. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Comment:  The UAEG continues to provide the Iraqis 
with generous levels of assistance, but via several sources 
(military, humanitarian, funding training provided by other 
countries, "private" gifts by ruling family members, etc.). 
Although we have reported extensively on UAE assistance to Iraq, 
our ability to estimate "dollar figures" has been hampered by 
both the wide-ranging nature of the assistance and by the UAEG's 
unwillingness/inability to provide comprehensive statistics.  In 
May 2004, the UAE Embassy provided the Department with a chart 
showing approximately $32 million in UAE Red Crescent 
humanitarian assistance to Iraq.  This is the only detailed 
breakdown of assistance that the UAEG has provided.  End Comment
