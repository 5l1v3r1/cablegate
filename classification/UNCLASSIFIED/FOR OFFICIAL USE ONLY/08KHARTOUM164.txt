¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Umma party members are concerned that the USG has 
a "distorted perception" of their party and they are eager to set 
this image straight.  Additionally, they call for USG support for a 
multi-opposition party dialogue on critical issues such as Darfur 
and the CPA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On 31 January Umma party members Professor Balgees Badri, Dr. 
El Sheikh Mahgoub and Mr. Mohamed Abdulla Adouma called on CDA 
Fernandez to discuss what they perceive as a "distorted perception" 
of the Umma Party by the USG.  Professor Badri introduced herself 
and her two colleagues as a three-person Umma committee that will 
specifically focus on "Western issues" and dialogue with Western 
diplomats on Umma party activities.  The committee began its mission 
by meeting with the American Embassy. 
 
-------------------------- 
"DISTORTED IMAGE" OF UMMA 
-------------------------- 
¶3. (U) Professor Badri laid out what Umma party members believe are 
incorrect USG perceptions about Sudan and the Umma Party: (a) all 
Northern political parties are the same (fundamentalist Islamic), 
(b) when the Umma party was in power (1986-1989) it committed human 
rights violations, and (c) Umma has lost all of its constituencies. 
Badri rejected these perceptions and claimed that the Umma Party has 
a history of democratic rule and preaches moderate Islam.  She went 
on to say that the Party is committed to the Millennium Development 
Goals and has no record of corruption.  She questioned CDA Fernandez 
as to how Umma could change this "distorted image" of her party in 
the US. 
 
¶4. (U) CDA Fernandez responded that it is important that Umma party 
members understand USG perceptions and priorities in Sudan.  He 
emphasized that the top two USG priorities in Sudan are:  finding a 
solution to the violence in Darfur and seeing that the CPA is 
implemented.  CDA Fernandez said, "We respect the Umma Party.  We 
believe it is democratic."  He explained that Americans do not have 
"bad feelings" about the Umma Party, but said that the Umma Party 
faces a challenge.  There is a perception that "maybe your time has 
passed." You must therefore work hard to prove your relevance to 
your fellow countrymen and the USG, said Fernandez.  He urged the 
party to unite and speak out on issues that are important to 
Sudanese citizens. Show your relevance on Darfur and the CPA, said 
Fernandez.  He encouraged them to fill the current "political 
vacuum" that exists between the NCP and the SPLM. "There has been a 
new politicization of Darfur" and Darfurians now look to rebel 
leaders such as SLM's Minni Minnawi or SLM/A's Abdelwahid al-Nur 
instead of political party leaders, said CDA Fernandez.  "Become 
strong, find a position, and be vocal" on issues that are important, 
urged Fernandez. 
 
¶5. (U) Professor Badri retorted, "We believe that if we weren't 
powerful, we wouldn't exist."  She said she believed that the Umma 
party still had large constituencies in Darfur, despite the fact 
that many Darfurians now associate themselves with rebel movements 
instead of political parties.  She and the other members agreed that 
there is indeed a political vacuum to fill and that perhaps Umma can 
find its way into that space. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
UMMA SEEKING HELP WITH POLITICAL DIALOGUE 
------------------------------------------ 
¶6. (SBU) Professor Badri said that Umma would like to see an 
"international conference on Darfur with proper negotiation on a 
grass-roots level." She asked for USG support on this idea.  Badri 
also announced that Umma would like to start dialogue with "warring 
factions" from the East, Darfur, and the SPLM and potentially form a 
coalition with these groups.  She asked that the USG help Umma bring 
these groups together to start a dialogue.  She said that Umma, as a 
moderate Islamic party, would be accepting of all tribal groups in 
the South.  Badri said that the NCP has tried to weaken Umma and 
seeks to make all opposition political parties powerless.  CDA 
Fernandez agreed and observed that the NCP's actions have succeeded 
in destroying almost all northern political parties by dividing them 
from within.  Because of the NCP's ability to control State 
finances, the military, and the intelligence services, it has 
amassed wealth and power, even though it may have little popular 
support among Sudanese citizens, he said. 
 
------------------------------- 
ELECTIONS - A TOOL FOR CHANGE 
------------------------------- 
¶7. (SBU) Professor Badri emphasized that the upcoming national 
elections must be held in a free and fair way. She described the 
elections as "the only tool for change."  Badri said the elections 
 
KHARTOUM 00000164  002 OF 002 
 
 
could help solve many issues, including the problems of Darfur and 
Abyei. Badri promised that the Umma party would offer good 
governance and claimed "we have nothing against anybody."  At the 
same time, she warned that even if the NCP loses majority 
representation in the GNU, it does not mean they will lose control 
over State finances or the economy. 
 
¶8. (SBU) COMMENT: Although the Umma Party wants to regain the 
political power and broad-based support it had in the late 80s, it 
will have to effectively articulate positions on key issues such as 
the Abyei dispute, Darfur, and CPA implementation to catch the 
attention of the populace. It will also need to democratize 
internally beyond the immediate control of the Al-Mahdi family 
circle, something it has so far been loath to do. Additionally, it 
will have to wisely seek out coalition partners ahead of the 2009 
elections in order to reasonably compete against the NCP or the 
SPLM.  As supposedly the largest political force in Sudan after the 
NCP and the SPLM, an alliance by one of the CPA partners with the 
Umma Party could tip the balance in its favor.  Re-building its 
battered constituency in Darfur would greatly strengthen its hand 
and the Umma Party would likely be muzzled if it begins to speak out 
aggressively on Darfur.  Repression of Umma Party leader Al-Mahdi 
would carry many risks for the NCP, however, so we would expect the 
Umma party to begin to speak out.  A quiet Umma party may mean an 
alliance with the NCP is already in the works.
