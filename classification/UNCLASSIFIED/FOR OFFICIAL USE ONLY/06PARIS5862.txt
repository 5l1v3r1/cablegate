NUCLEAR COOPERATION INITIATIVE AT OCTOBER 2006 NUCLEAR 
SUPPLIERS GROUP MEETING - FRENCH RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 140484 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU)  On 28 August, Embassy ESTH/NP Counselor and 
ESTH/NP officer jointly presented arguments and papers to 
French MFA Deputy Director for Nonproliferation and 
Disarmament Hugues De Longevialle concerning French support 
for the India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative at the 
October 2006 Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) Consultative Group 
(CG) meeting in Vienna.  In response to points, De 
Longevialle commented that the French position on the 
Initiative remained favorable, and referenced the similar 
civilian nuclear agreement France had reached with India.  He 
pointed out, however, that several members of the NSG needed 
further convincing regarding the merits of the Initiative 
within the broader context of the NSG's nonproliferation 
goals.  ESTH/NP counselor acknowledged that the issue will 
likely be a topic of discussion at the CG meeting, adding 
that for this reason the U.S. was seeking statements of 
support for the Initiative from France and other 
participating governments.  De Longevialle concluded by 
assuring embassy officers that his office would further 
review the U.S. request, but that France would be prepared to 
argue in favor of the Initiative at the CG meeting in Vienna.
