SUBJECT: GUINEA-BISSAU: REQUEST FUNDING FOR ELECTION SUPPORT 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request.  See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2.  (U) As a result of the March 2 assassination of President Joao 
Bernardo Vieira, interim-President Raimundo Pereira will have to 
oversee presidential elections within 60 days, as called for in the 
constitution.  However, the GOGB does not have the resources to 
conduct an election so soon after the November 2008 legislative 
elections.  By all accounts - including those by Embassy, EU, UN, 
AU, and ECOWAS observer Missions -- the National Election Commission 
(CNE) conducted a free, fair, and transparent election in November. 
However, the election was put at risk on several occasions in the 
lead up to polling day by strikes from unpaid poll workers.  If the 
elections are to be held successfully, the international donor 
community will have to provide resources to the CNE, primarily for 
materials and/or salaries. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) As noted in the Mission Strategic Plan (MSP) for 
Guinea-Bissau, the country is at risk of becoming a narco-state. 
While the assassinations of President Vieira and Chief-of-Staff 
General Tagme Na Wai have increased that risk, their departure from 
Bissau-Guinean politics provides a window of opportunity to 
reinforce the positive steps toward democratization that was made in 
the last two successful elections. 
 
¶4.  (U) ACTION REQUEST: Post requests funding for a grant for an 
international organization or NGO to provide support to the CNE as 
it prepares for and conducts Guinea-Bissau's presidential 
elections.
