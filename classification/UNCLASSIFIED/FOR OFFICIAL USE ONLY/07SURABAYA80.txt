¶1. (SBU) Summary: Mudflow victims are planning to take their 
case against the government and Lapindo company to The Hague 
after the Jakarta District Court rejected their law suit. The 
judges ruled that, in spending Rp 1.63 trillion (USD 175 
million), the government and Lapindo have "done what they had to 
do." Victims are apparently also considering requesting 
assistance and possible asylum from U.S. Consulate General 
Surabaya.  Victims are considering using compensation payments 
to purchase new houses from a Lapindo subsidiary.  UNEP is 
reportedly providing a grant to a local university to study 
potential uses for the mud.  A lack of rain is raising concerns 
as sedimentation increases in the Porong river.  End Summary. 
 
Taking Their Case to International Court 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On November 27, the Jakarta District Court rejected a law 
suit brought by victims of the Sidoarjo mudflow against 
President Yudhoyono, the ministers of Energy and Mineral 
Resources and the Environment, the East Java Governor, the 
Regent of Sidoarjo, and the Lapindo company.  The Indonesian 
Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI), representing the victims, accused 
the government and company of being slow to address the social, 
economic, and psychological damage caused by the mudflow.  YLBHI 
also accused the defendents of failing to carryout legal 
obligations to protect victims' rights and of being in violation 
of Indonesian Law No. 11, 2005, on the ratification of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
 
¶3. (U) According to press reports, the team of judges rejected 
all accusations and expressed the view that the defendants had 
already done their best to address the impact of the mudflow and 
did not violate any laws.  In explaining the verdict, the judges 
noted that Rp 1.63 trillion (USD 175 million) had already been 
spent.  One of the judges, Martini Mardja said; "The government 
and all of the defendants have done what they have to do."  An 
official from Sidoarjo Mud Management Agency (BPLS) told us 
separately November 29 that approximately Rp 700 billion (USD 77 
million) has been spent on handling the mudflow.  The remaining 
Rp 900 billion (USD 96 million) has been spent on relocation and 
20% compensation payments to victims, daily cost-of-living 
allowances for those displaced, evacuation, and infrastructure 
repair (including repaving the main Porong road). 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to press reports, Taufil Basari, a lawyer for 
the victims, expressed disappointment with the verdict.  He 
complained that the judges had ruled out witness and expert 
testimony, focusing solely on the amount of money that had been 
spent.  He accused the judges of disregarding the humanitarian 
costs.  Taufik added that YLNHI would appeal the verdict within 
14 days.  On November 28, local press reports announced that the 
victims were raising money in a planned effort to bring their 
case against Lapindo to The Hague.  Sunarto, the coordinator of 
a local NGO (Pagar Rekontrak), told reporters that the victims 
were also lobbying U.S. Consulate General Surabaya and 
considering requesting asylum in the U.S. (Note: On November 16, 
Pagar Rekontrak sent a formal letter requesting a meeting at the 
Consulate.  No date has been set.) 
 
Relocation 
------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Local media reported November 25 that PT Minarak Lapindo 
Jaya (a subsidiary of Lapindo) had purchased 200 hectares of 
land west of Sidoarjo with the intention of building 6,030 
houses.  The company announced that it would give priority to 
mudflow victims, who could use the remaining 80% compensation 
payment to purchase the house.  Reportedly, an estimated 1,500 
families from the Tanggulangin Housing Complex expressed 
interest in accepting PT Minarak's offer, calling the offer 
"realistic."  They are now awaiting details of the 
administrative process and the exact location of the homes. 
East Java NU Chairman Ali Maschan Moesa publicly suggested 
November 28 that relocation was the best solution for thousands 
of Sidoarjo mudflow victims.

UNEP Grant 
--------------- 
 
¶6. (U) According to local press reports, the UN Environment 
Program (UNEP) will provide a grant to ITS (the 10th November 
Institute of Technology in Surabaya) to conduct research over 
the next four months on potential uses for the mud.  The value 
of the grant has not been disclosed.  The research results will 
be reported to the UN, BPLS, and the Minister for Environment. 
 
Doing a Rain Dance 
--------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) According to BPLS officials, the lack of rain in East 
Java and corresponding decrease in the water flow rate in the 
Porong river has resulted in a buildup of sedimentation, 
especially near Pajarakan Village, close to where the mud enters 
the river.  BPLS is employing heavy equipment and dredgers in an 
effort to keep the mud moving, but BPLS admits it needs to do 
more.  Water released from the Lengkong Dam, which was being 
used to keep flow rates high and the mud moving, has been 
diverted to supply water to the city of Surabaya.  BPLS is now 
hoping for East Java's delayed rainy season to begin.
