Public Broadcaster Appoints Solly Mokoetle New Group Chief Executive 
Officer 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) SAPA reported that the South African Broadcasting 
Corporation (SABC) appointed former Telkom Media chief content 
officer Solly Mokoetle as its group chief executive officer. "The 
decision to appoint Mr Mokoetle was based on his experience and a 
proven track record during the time when the SABC was profitable, 
making him the most suitable candidate," the broadcaster's interim 
board chairwoman Irene Charnley said. "The board is confident that 
his appointment will provide the required leadership to turn around 
the SABC while maintaining public broadcasting mandate."  Mokoetle, 
who was the SABC's chief operations officer between 2001 and 
December 2006, takes office on January 1 on a five-year contract. 
His appointment followed a R11 million [Rand] (approximately $7.5 
million) settlement by the broadcaster to former CEO Dali Mpofu in 
August.  [Description of Source: Johannesburg SAPA in English --

ANCYL Leaders Defy Zuma, Attack SACP for "Hostile" Treatment of 
Malema 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Provincial ANC Youth League leaders have rallied behind 
their humiliated leader, Julius Malema, calling on the ruling party 
to discipline senior  South African Communist Party  (SACP) leaders 
Blade Nzimande, Jeremy Cronin and Gwede Mantashe, reported IOL on 
December 14.  The league's fresh broadside called for Mantashe's 
position as ANC secretary-general to be "reviewed" at the ANC's 
national general council next year.  In clear defiance of ANC 
President Jacob Zuma's call for insults and name-calling to end, 
youth league firebrands referred to delegates at the party's special 
weekend congress in Polokwane as "well-briefed hooligans and dogs" 
for booing Malema on the first day of its meeting in Limpopo. 
Malema had been invited as a guest but was booed, along with ANC NEC 
member Billy Masetlha.  Denied an opportunity to address delegates 
from the stage about the hostile reception they'd received, Malema 
later stalked out. [Description of Source: Johannesburg IOL in

Zuma's Zimbabwe Facilitators "Optimistic" ZANU-PF Will Abide by 
Agreements 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The Star reported on December 15 that President Jacob 
Zuma's Zimbabwe facilitators remain convinced that Zanu-PF will 
stick to its agreements in the unity government, despite the weekend 
Zanu-PF congress resolution that the party would make no more 
concessions to its opponents.  Lindiwe Zulu, Zuma's foreign policy 
adviser who serves on the Presidency's Zimbabwe facilitation team 
with former cabinet ministers Mac Maharaj and Charles Nqakula, said 
on December 14 that the congress resolution was cause for concern. 
Qon December 14 that the congress resolution was cause for concern. 
Nevertheless, she remained optimistic, based on the facilitation 
team's experience with Zanu-PF negotiations.  "We truly believe that 
Zanu-PF signed up to agreements and has to stick to those 
agreements," she added.  [Description of Source: Johannesburg The
