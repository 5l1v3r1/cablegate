SUBJECT: CHAD: FY06 SECTION 1206 - MISI INITIATIVE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 15918 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The N'djamena country team reviewed the 
Multi-National Information Sharing Program (MISI) options for 
Chad based on written and oral presentations from the MISI 
team.  The country team decided that MISI could be beneficial 
to Chadian security services, primarily as a tool for 
internet literacy and to increase internet connectivity 
(currently extremely low in Chad government services.)  To be 
an effective tool for inter-Government of Chad communication 
on security and to ensure an even level of competence, the 
program must include links to security services other than 
the Chadian national army (ANT) e.g. to police and other 
security services.  The program should not be implemented 
immediately, but should be part of a basket of TSCTP 
"deliverables" which should be discussed with the Government 
of Chad (GOC) in the context of improving GOC counterpart 
support for the TSCTP existing program as well as other 
issues of mutual interest (not limited to but certainly 
including cooperation on a UN presence in eastern Chad.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  To summarize: 
 
Program content:  focus on basic internet literacy 
Program coverage: to include all security services 
Timing: Only after high level discussions on the state of 
Chadian cooperation overall with TSCTP, and upon receipt of 
assurances that GOC counterpart support will be reinforced 
and greater resolution on the question of a UN presence in 
eastern Chad has been reached.
