Company contends that although the company is owned by the 
Government of Sudan (GoS,) the government does not benefit from 
Shiekan because it is an Islamic insurance company that annually 
returns its profits to its policy holders.  He further contends that 
Shiekan is the only insurancecomp!ny provilingcoverag vo
