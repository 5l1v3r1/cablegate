¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  A team of eleven Indonesian prosecutors from a 
key task force, accompanied by DOJ Resident Legal Advisor (RLA) and 
poloff, participated in a June study visit to the U.S.  The 
State-funded, DOJ-organized program gave the participants both a 
broad understanding of the U.S. criminal justice system as well as a 
more detailed look at how terrorism and other related crimes are 
investigated and prosecuted in the United States.  Task Force 
members showed great interest in further cooperation in prosecuting 
complex financial crimes, including terrorist financing, money 
laundering, and asset forfeiture.  DOJ/OPDAT training this fall will 
address prosecuting these crimes.  END SUMMARY. 
ASSISTANCE TO A KEY TASK FORCE 
¶3.  (SBU) Eleven members from the Indonesian Attorney General's 
Office (AGO) Terrorism and Transnational Crime Task Force visited 
Seattle, New York, and Washington D.C. as part of a study tour from 
June 17-26.  Mardjuki (one name only), the new chief of the Task 
Force, headed the delegation, which consisted of recently appointed 
members of the Task Force.  DOJ/OPDAT Resident Legal Advisor and 
poloff organized the visit and accompanied the group throughout to 
provide context and explanations for the Indonesian prosecutors. 
This was the third study tour benefiting members of the Task Force 
(reftel B). 
¶4.  (SBU) Created in 2006 and funded through a Memorandum of 
Understanding between the USG and the AGO, the Task Force is an 
elite group of prosecutors who are commissioned to handle 
high-profile case involving terrorism, money laundering, trafficking 
in persons (TIP), cybercrime and intellectual property rights. 
Since inception, the Task Force has successfully prosecuted 64 
terrorists, including 43 Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) members, as well as 
over 90 TIP cases. 
STUDY TOUR TO GIVE A FIRST-HAND LOOK 
¶5.  (SBU) The goal of the three-city visit was to expose the new 
Task Force prosecutors to how the U.S. investigates and prosecutes 
terrorism and transnational crimes.  The program included meetings 
with DOJ and other USG officials in New York and Washington and 
courtroom observations in Seattle and New York.  The group met 
prosecutors from the Western Ditrict of Washington, the Southern 
District of Ne York, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, ad 
DOJ's Criminal and Nattional Security Divisionsin Washington D.C. 
working on terrorism and othe transnational crime investigations 
and prosecutins.  Aside from the substantive terrorism meetings 
the program included courtroom observations andan introduction to 
the UU.S. judicial system. 
EPHASIS ON INTERAGENCY COORDINATION 
¶6.  (SBU) Altough the Task Force has had a positive experiencecoordinating with the Indonesian National Police'sterrorism 
investigation squad (reftel A), ht level of coordination has not 
been instituted througout the AGO.  To highlight ways collaboration 
can benefit prosecutors, te meetings with the FBI and members of 
the JointTerrorism Task Force emphasized the extensive infomal and 
formal cooperation at the federal level btween the prosecutors and 
other investigative agencies including the FBI, DHS/ICE, Border 
Patrol and the state and local police. 
COMPLEX FINANCIAL CRIMES: A NEW FRONTIER 
¶7.  (SBU) Although Indonesia has anti-money laundering and 
counterterrorism financing laws, the Task Force members emphasized 
that they had little to no experience prosecuting crimes under these 
laws.  In Washington, the group spent time with the Terrorism 
Financing Section of the National Security Division to learn more 
about building strong terrorist financing cases.  Although the Task 
Force has been very successful in bringing substantive terrorism 
cases, it has less experience trying cases solely on the grounds of 
terrorist financing.  Throughout the program, the team discussed how 
to make money laundering charges more routine in their criminal 
cases.  The Task Force intimated that these two issues were areas 
where they would like additional training opportunities. 
URGING FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS 
¶8.  (SBU) Prosecuting intellectual property rights (IPR) crimes and 
cybercrimes are two areas that Indonesian prosecutors have little 
experience.  In order to spur activity in these areas, the program 
included sessions on cybercrime and intellectual property rights 
with U.S. prosecutors.  In addition, the group met with Microsoft's 
law enforcement liaisons in Redmond, Washington to discuss the 
importance of prosecuting IPR cases and to learn how Microsoft has 
assisted U.S. prosecutors in cybercrime cases. 
FURTHER COLLABORATION

¶9.  (SBU) The visit moved forward USG's rule of law objectives and 
the counterterrorism and reform goals of Mission's Strategic Plan. 
In Washington, DC, the Task Force members met with DOJ's Deputy 
Assistant Attorney General and with State Department officials from 
INL, S/CT and GTIP to discuss the program and areas for further 
collaboration.  (Note: INL and S/CT currently fund training and 
support for the Task Force.)  The Task Force members, including the 
new head, enthusiastically participated in the lectures and 
discussions.  The program also allowed the U.S. to forge a deeper 
relationship with the new Task Force members and explain U.S. 
culture through a first-hand exchange.
