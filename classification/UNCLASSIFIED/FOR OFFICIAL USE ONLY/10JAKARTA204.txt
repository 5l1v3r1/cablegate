Minister of Trade of The Republic of Indonesia 
 
Ref No.: 188 /M-DAG/SD/2/2010 
Jakarta, 9 February 2010 
 
His Excellency 
Mr. Gary F. Locke 
United States Secretary of Commerce 
Washington, D.C. 
U.S.A 
 
Dear Secretary Locke: 
 
First and foremost I would like to wish you a Happy New Year. May 
our cooperation and pleasant relations continue to prosper 
throughout the year of 2010.  Although it has been a while since our 
last meeting during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
Ministerial Meeting and Leaders Summit, I still recall our engaging 
discussion. 
 
On the issue of PT. Newmont divestment, be rest assured that the 
Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs is looking into the 
matter seriously and with the objective of a swift and agreeable 
conclusion. 
 
Concerning the Digital Video Conference (DVC) for the Working Group 
on Intellectual Property Rights, I would also like to inform you 
that we have already agreed to hold a DVC on February 12, 2010 as 
part of the preparation leading up to the tenth Trade and Investment 
Council (TIC) Senior Officials Meeting this year.  It is hoped that 
some progress on bilateral issues will be made.  I greatly 
appreciate your supportive statement and offer of assistance to our 
effort in intellectual property rights protection.  We are hopeful 
of graduating from the Priority Watch List in this year's Special 
301 review. 
 
Last but not least, I wish to turn your attention further to the 
issue of subsidy and dumping allegations towards Indonesia's Certain 
Coated Paper (CCP) products.  Please note that the same allegations 
were found to be groundless in a previous case.  I appreciate the 
attention and efficiency of the handling of this case and hope for a 
positive closure. 
 
Thank you for your kind attention. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
Mari Elka Pangestu
