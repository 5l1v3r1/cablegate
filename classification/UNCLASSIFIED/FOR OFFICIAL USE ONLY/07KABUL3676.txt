Sensitive but Unclassified 
 
¶1. (SBU) After some delay in finding an appropriate site for the 
project, the 100 MW Kabul Power Plant project is underway.  What 
follows is a short overview of the several project components and 
where they currently stand.  Overall, the project is on schedule to 
deliver 67 MW of power to the Kabul grid by December 2008 and an 
additional 33 MW in April 2009.  The project has been "fast tracked" 
by USAID and the total cost is approximately USD 205 million. 
 
¶2. (SBU) PROCUREMENT OF THE 100 MW GENSETS - The generator sets 
(gensets) have been procured in three packages.  Each package 
consists of six generator units.  In all, three packages, 18 
generator units, will be used to supply the full 100 MW to the Kabul 
power grid.  The USD 109.7 million procurement contract for the 
manufacture of the generators was awarded to Caterpillar Power 
Generation Systems (CPGS) in August 2007.  The contract includes 3 
transformers and other associated equipment as well as engineering 
services and plant design.  The first package of generators is 
scheduled to arrive in Kabul in June 2008 followed by July and 
November 2008 deliveries of the other two sets.  This portion of the 
project is currently on schedule. 
 
¶3. (SBU) PROCUREMENT OF BALANCE OF PLANT - This portion of the 
project covers civil, mechanical and electrical works.  Included in 
this portion of the project are installation of the gensets, a fuel 
treatment plant, fuel tanks, an administration building and other 
on-site structures.  This tender document is about 85 percent 
complete and is expected to be awarded on February 14, 2008. 
 
¶4. (SBU) PROCUREMENT OF 110 Kv INTERCONNECTION - In order to connect 
into the existing Kabul transmission system, a 110 Kv substation and 
associated switchgear must be constructed.  The tender documents for 
this portion of the project are 95 percent complete and are 
scheduled to be awarded on January 24, 2008. 
 
¶5. (SBU) PROCUREMENT OF LOGISTICS SERVICES - This portion of the 
project covers the shipping/delivery of the three genset packages 
and associated equipment, including three step-up transformers. 
This tender document is 95 percent complete and will be awarded 
January 10, 2008. 
 
¶6. (SBU) PROCUREMENT OF AN OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT CONTRACT - This 
covers the hiring of a project Management Contractor to operate and 
maintain the power plant for a one-year period.  The contractor is 
also obliged to train local staff on operation and maintenance to 
enable handover to Afghan authorities.  USAID expects to begin 
working on this tender document in November 2007 and award the O and 
M contract in the September-October 2008 time frame. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Other, more minor, tasks associated with the preparation of 
the project site are currently underway and on schedule.  They 
include de-mining, a topographical survey, as well as leveling and

fencing of the site.  The project is proceeding apace and is 
expected to be completed on time.
