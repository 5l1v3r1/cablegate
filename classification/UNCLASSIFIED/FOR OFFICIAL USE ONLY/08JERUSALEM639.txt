SUBJECT: AL-AQSA BRIGADES GUNMEN TORCH NABLUS GOVERNOR'S 
CAR; 4 INJURED IN SHOOTOUT 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) According to Fatah and PA security contacts, 
al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades gunmen Tha'ar Tirawi and associates 
attacked Nablus Governor Jamal Muhaysin in Balata Refugee 
Camp in Nablus on April 13, torching Muhaysin's vehicle. 
Four Palestinians, including one of Muhaysin's bodyguards, 
were injured in the ensuing shootout when PA security forces 
entered the camp to extricate Muhaysin. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) PA security contacts told POL FSN that Tirawi had 
been in General Intelligence (Mukhabarat) custody for the 
last four months, and some of the other PA security bodies 
opposed his recent release.  (Comment: Despite progress in 
the Nablus security operation late last year, several 
Fatah-linked militant cells resist PA authority, and 
mechanisms to prosecute arrested militants remain weak.  End 
comment).
