¶1. (SBU) During a February 1 meeting with Acting Foreign 
Secretary Durga Bhattarai, Charge highlighted U.S. efforts to 
engage Iran on its nuclear program and Iran's continued 
unresponsiveness.  He urged Nepal to support efforts to 
increase pressure on Iran (reftel).  Charge noted that all 
countries have a stake in the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime.  Bhattarai thanked Charge and said that Nepal 
remained fully committed to nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation.  As a small country in the midst of three 
nuclear states, Nepal is particularly sensitive to risks of 
nuclear conflict. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Asked by Charge about Nepal's relationship with 
Iran, Bhattarai said the two countries rarely interact in 
international fora.  While Nepal and Iran share South Asian 
"civilizational" links, there was very little real contact 
between the two countries.  Bhattarai added that, unlike 
other Middle Eastern countries, very few Nepalis work in Iran.
