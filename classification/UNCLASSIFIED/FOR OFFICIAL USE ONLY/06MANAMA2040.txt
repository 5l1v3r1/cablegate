TFCO AND DEPUTY 
--------------- 
 
¶1. (U) Embassy Manama TFCO is EconOff Stephen Simpson, phone: 
(973)1724-2986, unclassified email: SimpsonSC@state.gov, and 
classified email: SimpsonSC@state.sgov.gov. 
 
¶2. (U) Pol/Econ Chief Steve Bondy serves as an alternate 
point of contact.  His contact information is: phone: 
(973)1724-2908, unclassified email: BondySC@state.gov, and 
classified email: BondySC@state.sgov.gov. 
 
----------------- 
TFCO COORDINATION 
----------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Post would welcome regional TFCO meetings to improve 
coordination among TFCOs as suggested reftel.  Such 
meetings could feature representation from TFCOs, Washington 
policy officials, and law-enforcement and banking officials, 
as appropriate. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post has enjoyed excellent State - Treasury/OFAC 
interaction.  Treasury has recently relocated the OFAC 
Regional Attache position from Manama to Abu Dhabi.  Post 
continues to coordinate with the OFAC regional officer on 
terror finance issues.  An effort should be made to invite 
TFCO participation at OFAC, FinCen and other relevant USG 
conferences in the interest of enhanced networking and 
information exchange. 
 
---------------- 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
---------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) While many of Post's local interlocutors are 
English-speaking, Department-provided Arabic translations of 
talking points and other materials have been useful as well. 
An International Information Program print publication on 
responsible charitable giving that conveys the individual 
donor's responsibility to "know your charity" might be an 
effective means of supporting local community awareness 
efforts, especially if available in Arabic as well as English. 
 
------------- 
NEEDS OF POST 
------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Post commends the EB/Terrorism Finance and Economic 
Sanctions intranet site for its broad inclusion of resources. 
 Front-channel TFCO best practices guidance, perhaps drawing 
on worldwide feedback to reftel, would also be useful.
