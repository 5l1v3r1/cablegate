REF: STATE 84207 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request -- please see paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Global Affairs officer delivered ref demarche to 
Claudia Schuett of the German MFA's International Economic 
and Financial Policy Division June 18 and to Ursina 
Krumpholz, Office Director of the Economics Ministry's 
Foreign Trade Law and Law of the Sea Division, June 19. 
Schuett and Krumpholz both expressed their appreciation for 
the details contained in reftel and said they would share the 
information with other appropriate German Government 
officials.  Especially useful, they noted, is the inclusion 
of the listed Iranian individuals' passport numbers, because 
the EU imposed a travel ban on Iranians sanctioned under 
UNSCRs 1737 and 1747 and would be able to deny visas if the 
listed Iranians try to enter an EU member state. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Schuett commented on the inclusion of Mizan Machine 
Manufacturing Group.  She noted that, according to the 
information in ref demarche, Mizan purchased state-of-the-art 
cranes for Iran's missile program in April 2005.  She asked 
whether the USG could provide more recent evidence that Mizan 
still acts as a front company for Iran's Aerospace Industries 
Organization (AIO) or Shahid Hemmat Industris Group (SHIG). 
Specifically, she asked whether the USG had evidence about 
Mizan's links to the AIO or SHIG after UNSCR 1737 sanctions 
were passed in December 2006.  German exporters, Schuett 
explained, might fear being punished retroactively under the 
U.S. Iran Sanctions Act and would like assurances that they 
will not be held liable for transactions with Iranian 
entities that were not under any UN or EU sanctions at the 
time. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post seeks guidance to respond to the German queries 
in paragraph 3.
