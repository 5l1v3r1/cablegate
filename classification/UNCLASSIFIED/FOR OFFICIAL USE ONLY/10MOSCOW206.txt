(SBU)  In addition to REF A, post delivered REF B request to 
State Duma International Relations Committee Chairman and 
Russian PACE delegation head Konstantin Kosachev and to 
Russian MFA Director for General European Cooperation 
Vladimir Voronkov.  While the GOR will give the request 
serious consideration, both of these offices were skeptical 
that they could meet the January 30 deadline.
