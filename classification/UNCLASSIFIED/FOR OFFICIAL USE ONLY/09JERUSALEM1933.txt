SUBJECT: CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM IN JENIN AS JALAMEH CROSSING 
OPENS TO ARAB-ISRAELI VEHICLES 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  On October 4, following the completion of 
USAID-funded structural improvements, Jalameh Crossing (on 
the West Bank-Israel border north of Jenin) opened on October 
4 for Arab Israelis in personal vehicles to cross into the 
West Bank and back for the first time since October 2001. 
Members of the Jenin Chamber of Commerce stressed that it 
would take several months to judge the economic impact and 
the sustainability of the flow of visitors.  They noted that 
Jenin's restaurants and streets were busy on the first 
weekend of Jalameh's opening.  End Summary. 
 
Jalameh Opens on Trial Basis 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The personal vehicle crossing at Jalameh opened the 
week of October 4 for approximately 20 vehicles per day, and 
gradually ramped up over the following two weeks to a cap of 
200 cars per day.  The crossing continues to operate on a 
"trial basis" from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, seven days a week. 
Vehicles entering the West Bank stop for an ID check and are 
given a list of items with which travelers are prohibited 
from returning to Israel through the crossing, including 
meat, dairy, eggs, car parts, and flammable materials.  No 
wait time was observed for cars entering the West Bank, while 
the waiting and processing time appeared to average about 
30-40 minutes during peak times for cars exiting Jenin to 
Israel.  When departing, passengers and drivers show their 
ID, open their trunks for spot checks, and are usually 
directed to a secondary inspection.  Local sources said that 
the crossing into the West Bank sometimes closes earlier than 
expected once the cap of 200 vehicles is reached.  Econoffs 
(who spent three hours at Jalameh attempting to enter Israel 
en route from Jenin to Jerusalem in a diplomatic vehicle on 
October 20) observed Arab Israelis returning home with 
shopping bags of goods and even furniture. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Members of the Jenin Chamber of Commerce were 
enthusiastic about the opening, noting that "For the first 
time, we believe you, USAID, and Mr. Blair when you talk 
about improving the economy!  Opening this crossing was the 
Chamber's priority."  Nasr Atyani, the general manager of the 
Chamber, added that the remaining uncertainty about the 
official opening, hours, number of permitted vehicles, and 
restrictions on bringing back goods needed to be cleared up 
in order to institutionalize the border easing. 
 
 
A Necessary But Not Sufficent Step? 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Members of the Jenin business community are hopeful 
that the influx of Arab Israeli shoppers will allow residents 
to capitalize on the security improvements and lead to 
noticeable improvements in what one Jenin businessman called 
this "blighted region."  However, in visiting Jenin to 
discuss the opening of the crossing, econoffs were repeatedly 
told by local residents that there are other steps required 
to restore economic vitality to the region.  Jenin's economy 
remains heavily dependent on agriculture and wages from 
workers in Israel.  Jenin's business leaders continue to call 
for the relaxation of restrictions that farmers face in 
accessing their fields near and on the other side of the 
separation barrier, and for increasing the number of permits 
for locals to work in Israel.
