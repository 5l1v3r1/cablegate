SUBJECT: CAMBODIA ON HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL VOTE 
 
REF: STATE 60967 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU)  Cambodia is in the midst of making determinations 
regarding its support for candidates from all geographic 
blocs for the new Human Rights Council, according to Sun Suon 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Department of 
International Organizations.  Pol/Econ Chief made demarche 
points in reftel, which Sun Suon took on board.  Sun Suon 
(please protect) noted that the African and Latin American 
blocs mostly lobby through their Ambassadors based in New 
York.  However, some of the larger Latin American countries 
(he named Brazil, Argentina, Cuba and Venezuela) are lobbying 
the Cambodian embassies in East Asia -- particularly in 
Bangkok and Beijing.  The Europeans are being particularly 
aggressive in all venues -- in New York, European capitals, 
and in Cambodia.  If a country lacks an embassy in Phnom 
Penh, they are inundating his office with faxes.  Among the 
Asian candidates, Cambodia is committed to Japan's 
membership; the others are still being reviewed.  He is 
having daily meetings with Asian embassy representatives 
lobbying for their respective countries.  He is thankful that 
Cambodia was smart enough to know that it would not be a 
competitive candidate for the HRC, particularly after the 
country's human rights performance in 2005. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Sun Suon plans to attend the upcoming NAM 
Ministerial in Kuala Lumpur at the end of April, and will 
represent the Cambodian delegation at the senior official's 
meeting.  Foreign Minister Hor Namhong is not expected to go, 
with Secretary of State Ouch Borith going in his place.  Sun 
Suon said the meeting will likely be the normal NAM talkshop, 
and he would like to see the organization focus more on 
economic and development issues and less on political issues.
