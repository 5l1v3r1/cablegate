¶1. (SBU) President Yudhoyono (SBY) spent the night of October 24 
in an air conditioned tent in a refugee camp near Mt. Kelud in 
East Java according to media reports.  The Center Volcanology 
and Geological Hazard Mitigation in Bandung had raised the 
warning level for eruption to the highest level possible on 
October 16 (Ref A).  This important institution advises the 
President on all matters related to geological threats. 
According to one official, the threat of an eruption is 
decreasing.  However the volcano's unpredictability and official 
fears of creating a false sense of security could delay lowering 
the eruption threat level. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The President was accompanied by the Coordinating 
Minister for People's Welfare Aburizal Bakrie, Cabinet Secretary 
Sudi Silalahi, Minister for Social Affairs Bachtiar Chamsyah, 
Police Chief Gen. Sutanto, Presidential Spokesman Andi 
Mallarangeng and East Java Governor Imam Utomo.  Official news 
services described the visit as an effort to encourage refugees 
already outside the 10km danger zone to remain there, and 
persuade villagers within the 10 km danger zone to depart for 
the camps.  The Indonesian Red Cross, local officials and the 
Indonesian Army have all struggled to convince affected 
residents to evacuate with widely varying levels of success. 
Residents have expressed little confidence in the ability of 
police, or anyone, to safeguard their homes from thieves during 
their time in the camps. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) An Indonesian expert (please protect) told us 
privately that "all parameters have been decreasing after 
October 16, including the water temperature in the crater and 
deformation.  We won't see an eruption in the near future, but 
if the warning level is lowered there is still the possibility 
of a quick change in the volcano.  Only God knows when it'll 
really erupt." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Following his visit to Mt. Kelud and environs, 
President Yudhoyono will travel by helicopter to visit the 
victims of another disaster, the Lapindo mud flow near Sidoarjo. 
 While the Coordinating Minister for Health and Welfare Aburizal 
Bakrie met with refugees of potential lava flows from Mt. Kelud, 
he is reportedly unlikely to accompany the President and brave 
the ire of refugees from the continuing disaster in Sidoarjo 
(Ref B).  The Minister's Bakrie Group had a controlling interest 
in the corporation implicated in the Sidoarjo mud flow disaster: 
Lapindo Brantas.
