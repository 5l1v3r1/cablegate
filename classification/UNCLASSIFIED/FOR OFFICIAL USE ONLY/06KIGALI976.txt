(SBU)  Charge de'affaires Thurston delivered the FY 07 MCC 
scorecard on October 6 to Francis Gatare, Presidential 
Advisor on NEPAD, and Ernest Rwamucyo, Secretary General for 
Development Planning at the Ministry of Finance.  Gatare and 
Rwamucyo were disappointed at Rwanda's drop in rankings on 
the Ruling Justly indicators, but not entirely surprised, 
given the recent drop in Rwanda's rankings by the World Bank 
(Ref B).  Gatare and Rwamucyo expressed the GOR's keen 
interest in conducting a dialogue with MCC and the Embassy on 
the the indicators and areas for improvement.
