¶1.  (SBU)  MFA AF DAS-equivalent Helene Le Gal informed us on 
April 22 that France recently sent letters to the DRC and 
India urging them to cooperate with one another with respect 
to MONUC so that India will not withdraw its forces from 
MONUC in response the perceived insult conveyed by DRC FM 
Alexis Thambe Mwamba.  Le Gal later provided the text of the 
letter from FM Kouchner to his DRC counterpart and the 
pertinent part of the letter from the MFA to the Indian MFA. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Informal translation of the letter from Kouchner 
to Mwamba follows: 
 
(Begin informal translation) 
 
--  Monsieur le Ministre, 
 
--  As you know, the situation in the eastern part of the DRC 
remains a major concern for France and the international 
community, which have been mobilized for several years in 
order to support the peace consolidation process in your 
country.  MONUC, whose numbers and mandate have been 
progressively reinforced, has played a role in the past, is 
currently playing a role, and is called upon to play a 
decisive role in the months to come. 
 
--  Just at the moment when encouraging perspectives are 
opening with respect to resolving the crisis in the eastern 
DRC, it seems essential that MONUC conserve and reinforce its 
capacity to fulfill the mandate conferred upon it by the UN 
Security Council, notably for the protection of the civilian 
population.  The maintenance of the Indian contingent, which 
is the largest element of MONUC, and its material, notably 
its aviation assets, seems to me a vital necessity in this 
regard. 
 
--  I take note, however, that India envisions a withdrawal 
of its contingent in this critical moment for the future of 
peace in the region, and I understand that only a formal 
action on your part with respect to the Indian authorities 
would lead them to reconsider this decision.  If this is the 
case, I can only encourage you to take such a step. 
 
--  Please understand, Monsieur le Ministre, that France, for 
its part, will spare no effort with the secretariat of the UN 
to ensure MONUC's effective and robust presence in the DRC. 
 
(End informal translation). 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Le Gal provided only an extract of the letter the 
MFA addressed to the Indian MFA.  The French asked "that 
India maintain its contribution to MONUC," without which 
MONUC "would no longer be able to undertake the tasks that 
the Security Council has given it."
