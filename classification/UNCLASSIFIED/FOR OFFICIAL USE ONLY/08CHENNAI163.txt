¶1. (U) We have no objection to this application. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We spoke by telephone on April 30 with K.S. Manjunath, 
Senior Stores Officer at the Defence Avionics Research Establishment 
(DARE) in Bangalore.  Manjunath confirmed that DARE had placed the 
order for the items listed in reftel, para 5.  We asked where the 
items would be installed and used; he said that they would remain in 
DARE's facilities in Bangalore.  He also invited us to visit DARE 
and inspect the items once they are received. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We explained to Manjunath that these items are on the U.S. 
Munitions List and are therefore controlled items that may not be 
re-sold or transferred without explicit USG authorization. 
Manjunath said that he understood these restrictions and emphasized 
that DARE intends to use these items at its facility and has no 
plans to sell or transfer them to another party.
