¶1. (SBU) In a meeting with donor representatives on May 
31, UN Deputy Special Representative for Iraq Staffan di 
Mistura announced that Paolo Lembo was being promoted to 
the job of Iraq Country Director for the UN Development 
Program (UNDP), from his current position as Humanitarian 
Coordinator.  Di Mistura said this move was important 
above all as a signal of the UN's deepening commitment to 
its in-country operations in Iraq.  Lembo's portfolio 
will not change, but he will soon be joined by a Deputy 
Humanitarian Coordinator.  Di Mistura said that one of 
Lembo's first priorities would be working with the EU on 
helping the Iraqis with constitution writing. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) COMMENT:  This continues the UN's efforts since 
January to strengthen its presence in Iraq.  Lembo has 
been a helpful and positive contact as Humanitarian 
Coordinator, and we anticipate this will continue in his 
new job.  End comment.  Satterfield
