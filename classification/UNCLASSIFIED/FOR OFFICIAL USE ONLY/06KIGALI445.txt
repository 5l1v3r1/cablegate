Rwandans in Burundi 
------------------- 
¶1. (U) In an 8 May meeting with poloff, UNHCR External 
Relations Officer Beatriz Garcia reported that the flow of 
Rwandans departing for Burundi has stopped and that there are 
unconfirmed reports that several hundred Rwandans have left 
northern Burundi and returned to southern Rwanda.  UNHCR has 
one returnee monitoring officer in southern Rwanda who will 
continue to investigate and report on the developing 
situation.  RwandaTV recently showed scenes of GOR officials 
ceremoniously greeting and welcoming Rwandans returning 
across the border. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a 22 April meeting with poloff in Bujumbura, 
UNHCR representative France Lau reported a total of 19,570 
Rwandan asylum seekers in northern Burundi. Of that number, 
under five percent had received refugee status and the 
remainder were designated as "illegal immigrants" by both the 
GOR and GOB.  All individuals denied refugee status are 
eligible to appeal the decision; however, Lau said the appeal 
process would be slow as there are only two legal aides 
assisting the denied applicants.  She opined that very few 
would succeed in their appeal.  Lau reported no overt 
pressure from either government to forcibly return the asylum 
seekers.  (Note. In mid-June 2005, approximately 5,000 
Rwandan asylum seekers were involuntarily returned to Rwanda 
by GOR police and military units. The operation was supported 
by GOB security forces. End note). 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Lau, the primary reason for granting 
refugee was the demonstration of a well-founded fear of 
persecution if returned to Rwanda. The primarily Hutu asylum 
seekers generally did not use gacaca as a reason for fleeing 
Rwanda, but tended to use a more general "atmosphere of fear" 
rationale.  The recent drought in south Rwanda and subsequent 
food insecurity was also considered a factor.  Lau said she 
was not aware of any recruitment of Rwandans by Democratic 
Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) in the Burundian 
camps. 
 
Burundians in Rwanda 
-------------------- 
¶4. (U) Separately, Garcia reported that the Nyamure Refugee 
Camp, in the former Butare Province, has been closed in order 
to consolidate UNHCR operations.  Approximately 1,500 
Burundian asylum seekers were transferred to the Kigeme 
Refugee Camp in the former Gikongoro Province.  The estimated 
2,500 refugees in Kigeme have been encouraged by UNHCR to 
return to Burundi and are transported back if they decide to 
return. (Note. UNHCR expects to be able to voluntarily 
repatriate approximately 2,000 of the refugees in 2006. End 
note).
