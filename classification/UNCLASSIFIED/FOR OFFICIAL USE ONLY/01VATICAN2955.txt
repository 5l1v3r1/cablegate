ON THE SIDELINES OF THE CONSISTORY: RELATIONS WITH ORTHODOX 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶3.   (SBU) TWO EASTERN RITE CARDINALS COMMENTED THAT THEIR 
CHURCHES SHOULD ACT AS MEDIATORS FOR ANY RAPPROCHEMENT WITH 
THE ORTHODOX CHURCH. VATICAN OFFICIAL CARDINAL IGNACE MOUSSA 
I DAOUD AND UKRAINE'S CARDINAL LUBOMYR HUSAR OPINED THAT 
THEIR EASTERN RITE CATHOLIC CHURCHES COULD HELP THE ORTHODOX 
UNDERSTAND THE WEST AND VISA VERSA. (COMMENT: THE CANON LAW 
FOR EASTERN CHURCHES INSISTS ON THE PRIMACY OF PAPAL 
AUTHORITY IN ALL MATTERS OF DOCTRINE, DISCIPLINE AND 
GOVERNANCE. UNLESS ROME DOES AN ABOUT FACE, IT IS DIFFICULT 
TO IMAGINE THE ORTHODOX CHURCHES MOVING CLOSER TOWARDS 
RESOLVING THEIR MISTRUST OF REAL OR IMAGINED INTENTIONS OF 
ROMAN CATHOLICISM. DAOUD AND HUSAR'S OPTIMISM MAY HAVE BEEN 
MORE A PR EXERCISE AHEAD OF THE PAPAL VISIT TO UKRAINE THAN 
AN ASSESSMENT OF THE REAL STATE OF RELATIONS WITH THE 
ORTHODOX. END COMMENT).

NUTRITION AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.   (U) THE VATICAN DELEGATE AT A UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 
ORGANIZATION MEETING HAS ARGUED THAT "THE RIGHT TO NUTRITION 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        VATICA  02955  01 OF 02  012330Z 
IS FULLY AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHT." ARCHBISHOP AGOSTINO 
MARCHETTO, PERMANENT OBSERVER TO FAO, WENT ON TO SAY THAT 
THE LACK OF SECURE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE FOOD IS ONE OF THE 
MOST SEVERE LIMITATIONS ON HUMAN FREEDOM AND THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF COMMUNITIES. THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT THE HOLY SEE IS 
"PROFOUNDLY DISAPPOINTED" BY LACK OF PROGRESS SINCE THE 1996 
WORLD FOOD SUMMIT. HE REGRETTED THAT WORLD LEADERS AND 
DEVELOPED NATIONS HAD NOT TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE ADEQUATE 
FOOD SUPPLIES FOR NEEDY PEOPLE. DURING A TIME OF 
"UNPRECEDENTED PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT," HE SAID, IT IS A 
SCANDAL THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE REMAIN HUNGRY. HE REMINDED 
MEETING PARTICIPANTS OF THE CORE OBLIGATIONS IN REGARD TO 
FOOD SECURITY - TO ENSURE ACCESS TO THE MINIMUM ESSENTIAL 
FOOD WHICH IS NUTRITIONALLY ADEQUATE AND SAFE, TO ENSURE 
FREEDOM FROM HUNGER FOR EVERYONE.

¶5.   (U) VATICAN FM JEAN-LOUIS TAURAN DEFENDED THE JUNE 23- 
27 PAPAL VISIT TO UKRAINE AS A "PILGRIMAGE" THAT SHOULD NOT 
ALARM THEN RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH. IN A PRESS CONFERENCE 
MARKING THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH IN RUSSIA, ARCHBISHOP TAURAN SAID THAT THE 
80 MILLION MEMBERS OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH IN THAT COUNTRY 
SHOULD NOT FEEL THREATENED BY A MERE 50,000 CATHOLICS. 
TAURAN SAID THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN RUSSIA WAS NOT IN THE 
BUSINESS OF PROSELYTISM OR PROPAGANDA. (NOTE: RUSSIAN 
POLITICIANS AND ORTHODOX CHURCH LEADERS ARE SPEAKING OUT 
WITH INCREASING REGULARITY AGAINST THE PAPAL VISIT TO 
NEIGHBORING UKRAINE. OPPONENTS SUSPECT THE UKRAINE TRIP IS A 
VATICAN PLAN TO EXPAND CATHOLIC INFLUENCE IN TERRITORY WHICH 
THE RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH CONSIDERS ITS EXCLUSIVE DOMAIN. 
END NOTE). TAURAN TRIED TO ALLAY THE FEARS, DESCRIBING THE 
VISITS AS "A RELIGIOUS EVENT AND A PILGRIMAGE." HE SAID IT 
IS EXACTLY WHAT THE POPE WOULD LIKE TO DO IN RUSSIA. 
HOWEVER, THE MOSCOW PATRIARCHATE HAS ALREADY DECLARED THAT 
RELATIONS WITH ROME WILL WORSEN IF THE POPE MEETS WITH 
UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX LEADERS WHOM THE PATRIARCHATE CONSIDERS 
TO BE IN SCHISM. SOME OF THOSE LEADERS BELONG TO UKRAINE'S 
COUNCIL OF CHURCHES AND ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN 
ECUMENICAL MEETING WITH JOHN PAUL II.

¶6.   (U) POPE JOHN PAUL II WANTS SOCIAL JUSTICE AND THE 
RESOLUTION OF THE "EXECRABLE CRIMES" OF THE PAST IN 
GUATEMALA. HE WAS SPEAKING TO A GROUP OF GUATEMALAN BISHOP 
MAKING THEIR FIVE YEARLY BRIEFING VISIT TO VATICAN CITY. THE 
POPE SAID GUATEMALA "HAS WITNESSED THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD OF 
TOO MANY CHILDREN." HE ADDED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO REVIVE THE 
MEMORY OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE COUNTRY'S CIVIL 
WAR. IN HIS RESPONSE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE GUATEMALAN 
BISHOPS CONFERENCE, ARCHBISHOP VICTOR HUGO MARTINEZ 
CONTERARAS OF LOS ALTOS QUETZALTENANGO-TOTONICAPAN, SAID HIS 
COUNTRY'S SOCIETY WAS TROUBLED BY "VIOLENCE, ORGANIZED 
CRIME, DRUG TRAFFIC AND CORRUPTION." AFTER 36 YEARS OF CIVIL 
WAR, HE ADDED, "THE PEOPLE OF GUATEMALA HAVE LOST ALL 
CONFIDENCE IN POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT." HE SAID THAT IN ORDER 
TO REGAIN THE PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE THE GOVERNMENT MUST CALL 
TO ACCOUNT THE PERPETRATORS OF CRIMINAL VIOLENCE AND 
SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE MURDER OF BISHOP JUAN GERARDI.

¶7.   (U) THE VATICAN ANNOUNCED MAY 31 THAT POPE JOHN PAUL II 
WILL TRAVEL TO ARMENIA AND KAZAKHSTAN IN SEPTEMBER, HIS 
FIRST TRIP TO EITHER COUNTRY. THE VISIT TO ARMENIA HAS BEEN 
LONG EXPECTED AND WILL FEATURE THE POPE'S PRESENCE AT EVENTS 
MARKING 1700 YEARS OF CHRISTIANITY IN THE COUNTRY. THE 
VATICAN ESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH KAZAKHSTAN IN 
¶1992. THE POPE IS EXPECTED TO SPEND TWO DAYS IN EACH 
COUNTRY, WITH APPEARANCE LIMITED TO THE CAPITAL CITIES. POPE 
JOHN PAUL ALSO PLANS TO VISIT BULGARIA IN THE SPRING OF

EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WITH PREDOMINANTLY ORTHODOX POPULATIONS. 
LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF BULGARIANS ARE CATHOLICS. MERANTE
