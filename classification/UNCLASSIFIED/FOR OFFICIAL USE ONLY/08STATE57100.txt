¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 3. 
 
Background 
 
¶2. (SBU) The International Organization for Migration (IOM), 
which runs the Overseas Processing Entity (OPE) in Baghdad 
under contract to the Bureau of Population, Refugees and 
Migration, has requested that IOM caseworkers assigned on 
rotating TDYs to Baghdad be authorized to live and work under 
the security umbrella of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.  These 
IOM caseworkers conduct interviews with refugee applicants 
and prepare their cases for interviews with DHS/USCIS 
adjudicators.  As the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI) 
has a very limited staff ceiling, it has requested that IOM 
caseworkers be provided with housing, office space, and 
security coverage by the U.S. Embassy. The UNAMI Regional 
Security Officer and IOM/Baghdad representative inspected the 
"hardened" housing and office space designated for IOM 
caseworkers by the U.S. Embassy and confirmed that it meets 
UN security standards. The UNAMI RSO then drafted an MOU (ref 
B), which was approved by then-Acting DCM Ned Alford and 
Acting Management Counselor Terry Leech.  Approximately two 
weeks ago, UNAMI brought the request before UN 
Under-Secretary-General (U/SYG) for the Department of Safety 
and Security (DSS) David Veness, who (we understand) will 
make the final decision on the request. 
 
¶3. (SBU) USUN is instructed to engage DSS, at the level of 
U/SYG, if appropriate.  USUN should emphasize the invaluable 
work conducted by the IOM OPE/Baghdad caseworkers and the 
readiness and ability of the U.S. Embassy to accommodate the 
additional staff.  USUN should also stress the need to 
approve this request as soon as possible, preferably no later 
than June 1. 
 
¶4. (SBU) USUN is requested to report on the results of its 
engagement with DSS.  IO/UNP POC is Bridget Lines at 
LinesBM@state.sgov.gov or 202-647-7142.  Additional PRM POC 
is Lawrence Bartlett at BartlettLE@state.sgov.gov or 
202-663-1065.
