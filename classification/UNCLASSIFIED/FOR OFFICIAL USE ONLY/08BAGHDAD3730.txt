RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 123493 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU)   On November 23, we conveyed reftel points to 
Ambassador Talal Al-Khudairi, MFA's IO Chief, urging that 
Iraq support the First Committee resolution on Compliance 
when it comes before the UNGA Plenary.  In a November 25 
follow-up phone conversation, Al-Khudairi said Iraq had 
followed the Arab consensus in abstaining on the resolution 
when it came before the First Committee.  We reiterated our 
surprise and disappointment that Iraq had not joined with the 
other 142 countries supporting the resolution and underlined 
our hope that Iraq would be able to support it in the 
plenary.  Al-Khudairi was non-committal and didn't volunteer 
an opinion one way or the other but said he had forwarded the 
demarche to Deputy Foreign Minister Abbawi for his 
consideration.
