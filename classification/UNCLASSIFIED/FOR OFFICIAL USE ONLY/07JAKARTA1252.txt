1.(U) This is an action request.  See paragraph 7. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary: On May 1, Minister of Environment Rachmat Witoelar 
asked embassies and donor partners for their support during a 
briefing on Indonesia's plans for hosting the 13th session of the 
Conference of the Parties (COP 13) under the UN Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Bali, December 3-14, 2007.  Several 
high-level participants shared comments about plans for supporting 
the conference or other climate change control mitigation 
activities.  Following the meeting, Witoelar privately told Charge 
that he wanted COP 13 to focus on areas of international agreement, 
not division.  The Minister plans to visit the United States later 
in the year to meet with high-level climate change contacts and 
develop a mutually beneficial agenda for the conference.  He asked 
for our help to develop an appropriate schedule.  End Summary. 
 
COP 13 Planning 
---------------- 
 
¶3. (U) At a working lunch on May 1, Minister Witoelar and staff 
briefed approximately 40 representatives from the international 
donor community on Indonesia's plans for hosting COP 13.  The MOE 
expects over 10,0000 attendees at the event.  Their estimates 
include approximately 2,000 attendees from delegations of 189 
countries; approximately 2,500 media and press attendees; and 6,000 
participants from civil society, nongovernmental organizations, 
universities and private companies. In addition to the official 
meetings of the COP 13, Indonesia expects 800 sessions and side 
events, including a possible Governor of Bali sponsored event 
inviting key governors involved in climate change mitigation 
activities.  The Government of Indonesia (GOI) will invite 
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to this event. 
 
¶4. (U) MOE staff outlined a series of events, workshops and meetings 
that COP 13 organizers are using to plan for the event, including a 
pre-COP planning meeting in Bogor in September.  The MOE reported 
that funding sources included GOI budget financing of $16,000,000 
and welcomed support from donors for related workshops and 
activities.  MOE noted that the Asian Development Bank had pledged 
$200,000, and that Norway and Germany had each pledged $500,000 for 
supporting activities.  Indonesia plans to conduct bilateral 
workshops and meetings in key countries to develop the program. 
 
Donor Assistance 
----------------- 
 
¶5. (U) A number of Mission representatives made brief statements of 
support for COP 13 related activities.  Most significant 
contributions included: 
 
-World Bank commitment to provide $1 million for pilot projects 
related to deforestation and land degradation, along with $500,000 
for COP 13 planning activities. 
 
--Australia's recent announcement to fund AUS $200 million (USD 165 
million) in forestry and climate change activities, with the 
intention to direct 25% of this fund to Indonesia. 
 
--United Kingdom's commitment to provide $500,000 to conduct an 
inventory of greenhouse gases, measure emissions in the region, and 
formulate a strategy for mitigation and adaptation. 
 
--U.S. spending on clean technology would have major impact on 
climate change. 
 
Environment Minister to Visit U.S. on Climate Change 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) At the meeting's conclusion, Witoelar privately told Charge 
that he wanted COP 13 to focus on areas of international agreement, 
not division.  Although his staff would be visiting many countries 
to establish COP 13 priorities, he personally planned to visit the 
United States if the right level official were available to meet 
him, perhaps in August or later.  The GOI wants COP 13 to make 
concrete decisions on climate change and Witoelar wants to learn 
what Washington believes can be accomplished at this meeting. 
 
Comment and Action Request 
-------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) We intend to work closely with our Ministry of Environment 
colleagues on identifying areas of mutual agreement on climate 
change for COP 13.  Embassy will consult with MOE on Witoelar's 
travel plans and his goals for the visit.  We request Department 
guidance on which USG officials might be available to meet with the 
Minister this summer.
