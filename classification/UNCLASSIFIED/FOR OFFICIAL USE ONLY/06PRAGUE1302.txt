¶1. (SBU) The Czechs have confirmed they will accept up to ten 
Cuban migrants this year. Ministry of Interior Head of the 
Unit for Policy, International Relations and Information on 
Countries of Origin Pavla Fridrichova said that if all goes 
well, the Czechs will consider accepting similar numbers in 
future years. Fridrichova and her deputy Katerina Sykorova 
are the primary points of contact for resettlement efforts 
(not the Czech MFA in Prague or the Czech Embassy in 
Washington). 
 
¶2. (SBU) On timing and procedure, Fridrichova said the MOI is 
prepared to begin the selection process immediately, and 
hopes to conclude it this fall. The MOI prefers to resettle 
two to three families with minor children (for a total of up 
to ten people), and will give special consideration to 
humanitarian criteria such as an illness or handicap. 
Further, the MOI prefers candidates who were persecuted for 
their political beliefs rather than for practicing their 
religion. The MOI will determine whether travel to Cuba to 
meet the candidates is necessary after reviewing the files. 
After the preliminary selection is made, a security screening 
will be necessary. The MOI hopes to welcome the selected 
families to the Czech Republic in early 2007. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Current status: The selection process is underway. 
Sykorova contacted PRM officials to confirm the MOI's offer 
to resettle the Cuban migrants. In response, PRM provided the 
files of five families that fit the profile described by the 
Czechs.
