SUBJECT: USG-SPONSORED LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY BUILDING IN 
HONG KONG AND MACAU 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Law enforcement cooperation and capacity 
building in Hong Kong and Macau are top priorities in Post's 
Mission Strategic Plan.  This cable highlights the active 
efforts by Post's eight resident law enforcement agencies 
during Fiscal Year (FY) 2009.  Post coordinated and/or funded 
training programs for 1,357 counterpart police, customs, and 
industry partners in Hong Kong and Macau.  Post resident law 
enforcement agencies with geographic jurisdiction over Taiwan 
coordinated their activities through the American Institute 
in Taiwan (AIT).  In some instances, Post pooled resources 
among the law enforcement agencies to provide comprehensive 
training courses in export control, money laundering and 
financial crimes.  Agencies also hosted counterparts at their 
respective US-based training academies, at the International 
Law Enforcement Academy in Bangkok, Thailand (ILEA-Bangkok), 
and successfully nominated participants to the Department's 
International Visitor Program.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (SBU) Law enforcement officers from Hong Kong and Macau 
participated in executive leadership courses, crisis 
management workshops and cybercrime investigation seminars 
offered through Post's Legal Liaison Office (LLO).  Of these, 
one Hong Kong Police officer attended a three-month 
leadership and management course at the National Academy (NA) 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), while two 
others attended the FBI's two-week Law Enforcement Executive 
Development Seminar (LEEDS) at Fredericksburg, Virginia. 
Three Hong Kong Police officers and one Taiwan police officer 
(invited via AIT) participated in the FBI's Pacific Training 
Initiative (PTI) for mid-level managers held this year in 
Manila.  Locally, LLO held one-day crisis management 
workshops for 80 law enforcement officers from Hong Kong and 
50 law enforcement officers from Macau, and four-day 
cybercrime investigation seminars for 25 Hong Kong police 
officers.  LLO also provided training to 282 Taiwan law 
enforcement counterparts in NA training, crisis management, 
and cybercrime investigations. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Hong Kong 
Country Office (DEA/HKCO) conducted one-day clandestine drug 
lab awareness workshops for 90 Macau Judiciary Police 
officers and 60 Hong Kong Police and Customs personnel. 
Through AIT, DEA provided asset forfeiture training to a 
total of 90 officers from Taiwan's Coast Guard, Customs, and 
investigative bureaus. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Criminal Investigative Division of the U.S. 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS/CID) at Post held financial 
investigative seminars in Hong Kong and Macau.  Three 
separate seminars, funded by the State Department's 
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Bureau 
(INL), included 24 participants from Hong Kong's Independent 
Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), 28 Hong Kong Police 
officers, and 24 members of Macau's law enforcement community. 
 
¶5. (SBU) U.S. Secret Service, Hong Kong Resident Office 
(USSS/HKRO) provided counterfeit currency detection training 
to 100 front-line employees of Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank 
(HSBC) and Bank of America (Asia) Ltd.  USSS/HKRO also 
offered unprecedented VIP protection training at ILEA-Bangkok 
for counterparts from Asian economies, including two each 
from Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China.  In Taiwan, 
USSS/HKRO shared counterfeit detection techniques with 160 
coast guardsmen, police, and prosecutors via AIT. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Agencies at Post also teamed up for local law 
enforcement capacity building.  U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) and IRS/CID, among other local and 
international presenters, provided presentations to an 
audience of 50 Hong Kong Police officers at a trade-based 
money laundering seminar organized and hosted by the Hong 
Kong Police.  ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
conducted a four-day bulk cash smuggling workshop for 35 law 
enforcement and customs officials in Macau and a three-day 
bulk cash smuggling workshop for 32 customs officers in Hong 
Kong.  CBP, ICE, Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry 
and Security (DOC/BIS), and Department of Energy (DOE) 
personnel provided export control proliferation awareness 
 
training to 56 Macau Customs and Economic Services personnel. 
 Coordinated by CBP in Hong Kong, DOE also conducted 
additional export control workshops for the identification 
and transfers of strategic commodities for Hong Kong Customs 
and Trade and Industry officers. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Regional Security Office, through input from 
Post's resident law enforcement agencies, nominated 59 host 
government law enforcement counterparts to attend 
ILEA-Bangkok training.  Course topics included personnel and 
facilities security, VIP protection, narcotics, crime scene 
investigations, computer crimes, leadership development, 
interview techniques, and counterterrorism.  During FY-2009, 
Post's law enforcement team also played a prominent role in 
the Department's Education and Cultural Affairs Bureau (ECA) 
International Visitor Program (IVP) with four law enforcement 
officers from Hong Kong and one from Macau taking part in the 
ECA-funded IVP. 
 
¶8. (SBU) FY-2010 training courses for Hong Kong and Macau law 
enforcement personnel have thus far included arson 
investigations and tactical safety planning.  In addition, 
the Economic and Political Section, working together with 
Post's ICE representatives, organized and funded 
anti-trafficking in persons seminars in Hong Kong and Macau. 
The seminars, taught in October by an ICE special agent and a 
U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) assistant U.S. attorney, 
received the participation of 50 law enforcement officers in 
Hong Kong and over 100 officers in Macau.
