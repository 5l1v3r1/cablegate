SUBJECT: REWANDA RESPONSE TO PROPOSED GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP 
FOR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD 
 
REF: STATE 123480 
 
¶1. (U)  Emboffs reviewed reftel talking points with Minister 
of State in Charge of Agriculture Dr. Agnes  Kalibata. 
Kalibata welcomed the initiative and agreed that a global 
partnership would be helpful for advancing global food 
security.  The Minister noted global food insecurity "will 
not go away" and needed to be addressed through global 
cooperative programs. 
 
¶2. (U)  Kalibata suggested that while much emphasis has been 
focused on food production, Rwanda needs more "post harvest" 
assistance.  She noted that "if farmers produce but then 
can't sell their products due to poor crop storage facilities 
and inefficient markets then there is no incentive for them 
to produce next season".  The minister recommended more 
attention be placed on organizing farmer cooperatives and 
providing them with assistance in selling their products 
outside of their immediate communities.  Better storage 
facilities and packaging materials were also key to selling 
beyond local markets, she said. 
 
¶3. (U) The minister said that Rwanda's harvests have been 
excellent, but that demand from external markets such as the 
Sudan and Uganda has keep prices relatively high.  While this 
benefited the rural communities, she admitted that urban 
consumers were suffering from the higher prices.
