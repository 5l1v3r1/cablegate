DEBY RETURNS LIKE A VICTOR

¶1. (SBU)  The Chadian elite turned out en masse the afternoon of 
February 9 to welcome home President Deby from his historic visit to 
Sudan and meeting with Sudanese President Bashir.  The diplomatic 
corps was convoked to stand shoulder to shoulder with GOC official 
and Deby's MPS party members.  Rumors that Sudanese President Bashir 
would also be on the plane proved unfounded but a Sudanesetechnical 
delegation is in country metings with Chadian homologues to resolve 
joint border monitoring details such as check-point locations and 
composition of teams. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Deby did not make any public remarks at the airport and 
disappointed expectations that he would give a speech in 
Independence Square.  Although most fanfare was concentrated at the 
airport, the President did emerge briefly from his car to greet some 
of those gathered at the square before turning into the presidential 
palace compound. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  In conversations with CDA at the airport, senior GOC 
officials expressed interested in SE Gration's visit but admitted 
being unable to discuss specifics before speaking with the President 
and FM Faki, who had also traveled to Khartoum.  Each interlocutor 
promised to pursue our visit requests tomorrow. 
 
¶4. (U)  Minimize considered.
