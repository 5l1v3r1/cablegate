¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  Just one day after six foreign health 
workers accused of intentionally spreading HIV left Libya for 
Bulgaria, French President Nicholas Sarkozy arrived in Tripoli 
on July 25 for wide-ranging discussions with Libyan leader 
Muammar Qadhafi.  Sarkozy and Qadhafi reportedly discussed 
construction of a nuclear water desalination plant, as well as 
enhanced cooperation in immigration, border security, health 
care, and defense procurement.  Unconfirmed press reports claim 
the two leaders also broached the subject of Darfur.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
LIBYA-FRANCE MEMORANDUM ON CIVILIAN NUCLEAR POWER 
 
¶2.  (U)  President Sarkozy arrived the day after six foreign 
medics accused of infecting over 400 Libyan children with HIV 
departed the country in a  French jet accompanied by Mrs. 
Sarkozy, who reporteldy brokered their release.  According to 
press accounts, Sarkozy and Qadhafi signed an MOU concerning the 
peaceful uses of nuclear power, committing France to finance 
construction of a long sought-after nuclear water desalination 
plant in Libya.  (NOTE:  Senior GOL officials have long lobbied 
for U.S. financing for a similar project, arguing such a 
"tangible reward" is necessary to convince the Libyan people of 
the utility of Libya's renouncing its WMD program.  Diplomatic 
sources in Tripoli say that the Libyans have approached many 
governments, including France, Russia, China, and South Korea, 
with requests for both a nuclear desalination plant and a 
nuclear medicine center.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶3.  (U)  In addition, the two reportedly discussed cooperation 
to limit the number of illegal migrants across the 
Mediterranean, including a head of state conference to be held 
in early 2008.  Sarkozy and Qadhafi also discussed French 
assistance to Libya's health sector, echoing promises contained 
in a July 23 memorandum (signed by EC Commissioner for External 
Relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner) that the EU would upgrade a 
Benghazi hospital to a regional center of excellence. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Libyan press also reported that Sarkozy and Qadhafi 
discussed Darfur, just days after Sarkozy reportedly dispatched 
FM Kouchner to New York to lobby for quicker UNSC action on 
peacekeeping deployment. 
 
QADHAFI HOLDS MEETING AGAINST BACKDROP OF U.S.-DAMAGED TRIPOLI 
PALACE 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Qadhafi -- accompanied by Prime Minister Al-Mahmoudi, 
Foreign Minister Shalgham, U/S for European Affairs Obeidi, and 
U/S for African Affairs Treiki -- met for several hours with 
Sarkozy and his delegation (which included FM Kouchner and 
diplomatic adviser Levitte, but not Mrs. Sarkozy) at Qadhafi's 
Bab Azziziya compound in Tripoli.  (NOTE:  Part of the compound 
was damaged by U.S. fighter planes during the April 1986 
Operation El Dorado Canyon bombing campaign, and the GOL has 
kept it in its damaged state and erected a statue in front of it 
displaying a fist crushing a US fighter plane.  Libyan media -- 
and Qadhafi himself -- refer to Operation El Dorado Canyon as 
"the failed U.S.-Atlantic aggression on the Great Jamahiriyah." 
END NOTE.)  The GOL bussed foreign ambassadors to the compound 
to meet Qadhafi and Sarkozy and join the state dinner, which was 
held outside in front of the damaged building.  Local papers 
gave front-page coverage to the Sarkozy visit, including one 
with the headline:  "The Brother Leader Welcomes President 
Nicolas Sarkozy in front of the House that Remained Standing in 
the Face of the Failed American-NATO Enmity" (referring to the 
1986 bombings of Tripoli). "
