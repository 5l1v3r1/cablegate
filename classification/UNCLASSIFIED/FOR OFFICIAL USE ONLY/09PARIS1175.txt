SUBJECT: H1N1 rises sharply in French Pacific Ocean Territories 
 
¶1. (SBU)  New Caledonia, French Polynesia, and Wallis and Futuna 
have been hit hard by H1N1 in recent weeks, making up the bulk of 
all French H1N1 related deaths and infections.  The two deaths last 
week in New Caledonia spark concern as neither victim had any known 
pre-existing medical conditions.  Contacts at the French Ministry of 
Health informed the Embassy that France will be sending an Institute 
of Public Health (InVS) investigation team to New Caledonia to 
assess the situation and will advise on findings. 
 
¶2. (U) Incidence of H1N1 rose sharply in all French territories in 
the Pacific Ocean which are currently experiencing winter and normal 
flu season.  Those hit the hardest include New Caledonia, French 
Polynesia, and Wallis and Futuna. 
 
New Caledonia: The New Caledonia health authorities estimate 35,000 
cumulative cases of H1N1 since the beginning of the epidemic, which 
is  14 percent of the population. Most infections have been through 
secondary contact.  The southern province and in particular the 
capital, Noumea, is the earliest and most severely affected. Since 
the beginning of the epidemic, there have been five deaths including 
two without known risk factors 2 deaths all since August 17. New 
Caledonian authorities have downgraded their initial response to an 
H1N1 potential epidemic, cancelling the policy of closing any school 
in which a case was reported. The New Caledonia authorities stated 
that their reasoning was that it had become obvious that H1N1 could 
not be stopped and to close down whole schools had become 
"impractical" and "irrelevant."  This response was echoed across 
French Polynesia. 
 
French Polynesia: The French Polynesia health authorities note a 
sharp increase in H1N1 cases, an estimated 10,000 cases since the 
beginning of the epidemic, representing eight percent of the 
population. The five archipelagos and most islands have been 
affected. Since August 12, three deaths have been reported from 
individuals with risk factors (two women and an infant.) 
 
Wallis and Futuna: The epidemic is growing quickly in Wallis and 
Futuna.  Individual medical consultations have increased 50 percent 
from the previous week, four cases were hospitalized. Two thousand 
cases were noted by local health authorities for the week of 17 
August, an incidence of 15 percent of the population.  These numbers 
are underestimated due to the saturation of the healthcare system 
reported the local health agency.  No deaths have been reported. 
 
According to press reports, cruise ships from Australia have 
triggered scares in the French Pacific territories, after it was 
discovered that some passengers testing positive for H1N1 had not 
been quarantined, according to press reports. 
 
¶3. (SBU) It is unknown if the spread of infection is related to the 
onset of winter and the normal flu season.  The French government is 
closely monitoring the situation and has sent health officials to 
New Caledonia and French Polynesia to contain the outbreak, provide 
medical aid, and seek out lessons learned.  An investigation team 
will be deployed this week to assess the pandemic phenomena in the 
region.  The Embassy remains in contact with the Institute of Public 
Health (InVS) and will provide situation updates.  According to 
French Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot, what is being seen in 
these territories could foreshadow what will take place this fall in 
metropolitan France. 
 
¶4. (U) In metropolitan France the spread of H1N1  remains limited. 
From 17 to 23 August, the incidence of 28,000 consultations for flu 
remains below the epidemic threshold. 
 
¶5. (U) Influenza activity continues to increase in Martinique, while 
decreases in Guadeloupe. On the island of Reunion, influenza 
activity in continues to grow and is well above the maximum activity 
observed in the same period over the last five years.
