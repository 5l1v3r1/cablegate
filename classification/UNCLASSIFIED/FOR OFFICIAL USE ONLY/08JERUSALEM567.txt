Hamas Gunmen Enter University, 
Beat Students and Staff 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to university contacts and local press, 
Hamas Executive Force gunmen forcibly entered and occupied 
buildings at al-Azhar University in Gaza City early on March 
31 before departing by the afternoon of the same day.  (Note: 
While al-Azhar has student groups from all factions, the 
university and its administration have historically been 
informally associated with Fatah.  End note).  University 
officials had attempted to prevent a large rally to 
commemorate the death of Hamas spiritual leader Ahmad Yasin, 
as part of a general ban on political demonstrations on 
campus. Pro-Hamas students called on Hamas security men to 
forcibly allow the rally, and there are press reports that 
several students, professors and staff were beaten by the 
gunmen as the Executive Force occupied the campus. 
 
¶3.  (U) Al-Azhar Vice President for Administration Jabr 
al-Da'ur told local press that Hamas gunmen and students hung 
Hamas flags and posters of Ahmad Yasin and other Hamas 
leaders all over the campus.  Hamas security officials 
claimed to local press that the Executive Force had acted 
properly and needed to enter the university to restore order 
amidst fighting between students.
