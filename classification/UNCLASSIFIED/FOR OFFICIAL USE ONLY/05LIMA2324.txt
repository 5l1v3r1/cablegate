Ref: Lima 2271 
 
¶1. (U) Post submitted reftel reporting on mala fide 
applicants who obtained non-immigrant visas by faking a 
medical handicap.  Applicants had appeared at the Embassy 
with one eye glued shut to simulate a vision problem 
requiring medical attention in the United States.  The 
applicants paid visa fixers up to USD 5,000.  The fixers 
fabricated medical certifications, which were then used to 
obtain legitimate documentation certifying that the person 
was handicapped. 
 
¶2. (U) Internal auditors working at the Peruvian Ministry of 
Women and Social Development detected the scheme and 
contacted Post's Fraud Prevention Unit.  FPU, working with 
RSO and the Peruvian National Police, interviewed applicants 
with pending visa applications.  These applicants were 
subsequently arrested by the PNP, as were the visa fixers. 
Of the 11 fraudulent visa applicants (since May 2004) that 
FPU has identified, six visas had been issued. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post requests Department assistance to revoke visas 
issued to the following applicants under 212(a)(6)(C) since 
the misrepresentation was material to visa issuance.  The 
children no longer overcome 214(B).
