¶1. (U) Summary: Ontario faces an overflow of kitchen compost, and 
has begun sending thousands of tons to New York state for 
incineration.  The province's Green Bin program has grown so quickly 
that it has outstripped the ability of municipalities to process 
organic kitchen waste locally, a situation that is expected to 
continue into the foreseeable future.  Cities such as Toronto are 
struggling to ramp-up their processing capacity as they aim to meet 
their own waste diversion deadlines -- an integral part of the 
province's agreement to phase out municipal trash shipments to 
Michigan by the end of 2010.  The shipment of organic waste to New 
York seems acceptable to all parties for now.  Over time, however, 
the expected Ontario annual excess of 50,000 or more metric tons by 
the end of 2010, much of which will end up in New York, may strain 
New Yorkers' patience and generate familiar complaints about foreign 
garbage unless the U.S. recipients prepare to proactively make the 
case that the organic waste imports work to New York's advantage by 
lowering New York power costs and generating local jobs.  End 
Summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Green Bin Program Saves Green Money 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Ontario's Green Bin program was introduced in Toronto in 2002 
as a means to reduce the amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) that 
was shipped to landfills.  Originally pledging 100% MSW diversion by 
2010, in 2007 Toronto changed its goal to 70% waste diversion by 
2010, which coincides with the province's 2006 commitment to 
Michigan to phase out shipments of MSW to that state, following 
threats of legislative action by Michigan's Senators (reftel). 
 
¶3. (U) The province has successfully encouraged other Ontario 
municipalities to introduce Green Bin programs.  Since 2002, the 
other three largest regional municipalities in the Greater Toronto 
Area (GTA) - York, Peel, and Durham Regions - all have adopted Green 
Bin programs.  In fact, most major Ontario cities have them, with 
the exception of London, Windsor, and Ottawa.  In 2007, Ontario 
municipalities collected 251,368 metric tons of kitchen scraps in 
green bins, up 30% from a year earlier. 
 
¶4. (U) Toronto's composting program is the largest-scale program of 
its kind in North America.  Some 510,000 single-family homes in 
Toronto already have access to the city's kitchen composting 
program, whereby people can put out organic waste (food scraps, 
paper towels, coffee grounds, and other similar waste material) 
separately from other garbage and recycling items.  According to 
City of Toronto officials, 95% of single-family households currently 
use the Green Bin program, and organics represent 30% of household 
waste.  At multi-unit dwellings, Green Bin programs are being 
phased-in over 18 months, and all 4,500 apartment and condominium 
complexes (490,000 homes) in the city should be included in the 
program by 2010, increasing organic waste collection from all 
participating Toronto households to 170,000 metric tons annually, up 
from about 115,000 metric tons in 2008. 
 
¶5. (U) In order to encourage Green Bin and recycling compliance, 
Toronto began charging single-family homes a waste management fee in 
November 2008, whereby trash bins are issued to all city households. 
 Households receive five additional tags per two-month period, which 
allow standard-size bags of non-recyclable garbage to be picked up 
at no extra charge.  Additional garbage collection costs C$3.10 per 
tag/bag, whereas collection of Green Bin organic waste, also known 
as source-separated organics (SSO), is free.  Garbage bag collection 
restrictions have also been introduced elsewhere in the GTA, 
including York and Durham. 
 
------------------------------- 
But Organic Waste Smells Rotten 
------------------------------- 
¶6. (U) Ontario's Green Bin program has grown so quickly that it has 
outstripped the ability of municipalities to process the organic 
waste locally.  Instead, thousands of metric tons of kitchen waste 
have been shipped to Covanta Energy, in Niagara Falls, New York, for 
incineration.  York Region sent nearly 12,000 metric tons of green 
bin waste to Covanta between March and August 2008.  The 
southwestern Ontario city of Guelph, considered a composting 
pioneer, has shipped 10,000 metric tons of kitchen waste a year to 
Covanta Energy since Guelph closed its own facility in 2006 due to 
odor problems and to structural weaknesses at the facility's 
building caused by ammonia.  As of this writing, no kitchen waste 
from Toronto has been shipped to New York for incineration. 
Instead, Toronto shipped roughly 1,000 truckloads of organic waste 
to Quebec each year until November 2008, when the two plants in 
Quebec - GSI Environment and Ferti-Val - were closed, mostly due to

severe odor problems. 
------------------ 
Fixing the Problem 
------------------ 
 
¶7. (U) The city of Toronto is now processing 100% of its kitchen 
waste in Ontario.  Since November, when the Quebec plants closed, 
Toronto has ramped up contracts with two new Ontario facilities -- 
Dutch-owned Orgaworld, near London, Ontario, which opened in 2007, 
and Universal Resource, a C$17 million recycling and composting 
facility in Welland, Ontario, which opened in 2008.  Toronto now 
ships about 70,000 metric tons of organics annually to these two 
plants.  York Region ships 30,000 to the Orgaworld facility.  At 
full capacity, the Orgaworld facility is expected to process 150,000 
metric tons a year. 
 
¶8. (U) In 2007, Toronto City Council approved two new composting 
facilities within the city's limits.  At full capacity, each of the 
two facilities will be capable of processing 55,000 metric tons of 
organic material -- two-thirds of the city's projected 2010 
processing needs. 
¶9. (U) Outside of Toronto, the city of Guelph also plans to 
re-establish a compost plant by 2011 that will process 30,000 metric 
tons of organic waste per year.  Since the facility's capacity will 
exceed what the city currently produces in kitchen waste, the new 
facility expects to be able to accept organic waste from other 
municipalities for a fee of C$50-100 per metric ton.  Peel Region 
has a compost-curing facility, located in Caledon, which also closed 
in 2007 due to odor problems.  After that closure, Peel Region 
shipped 50 truckloads of partially composted kitchen waste to a 
Barrie topsoil company in 2007.  The company did not have approval 
from the Ontario Ministry of Environment to accept unfinished 
compost, however, and since has worked with Peel Region to clean up 
of thousands of plastic bags that held the organics.  Peel Region 
plans to reopen its Caledon curing facility in April 2009 after 
spending nearly C$11 million on upgrades to help curb the odor 
problem. 
¶10. (U) Ontario is currently reviewing its Waste Diversion Act. 
Municipalities are hopeful that the Act will contain a policy to 
establish multiple grades of compost for waste diversion, instead of 
just one, as it has today.  (Note: Having multiple compost grades 
allows processed SSO to be used for a broader range of applications, 
such as brownfield redevelopment, instead of being limited to 
agricultural and gardening use, ultimately diverting more SSO from 
landfill.)  The public consultation phase closed on April 1, 2009. 
We do not expect to see a comprehensive plan to help municipalities 
recycle organic waste since the primary focus of the review is on 
the diversion of industrial, commercial, and institutional waste, 
which account for two-thirds of all Ontario's non-hazardous solid 
waste, including organic waste. 
¶11. (U) Comment: The good news is that by 2010, Ontario expects that 
its total organic waste processing capacity will reach 450,000 
metric tons, although that may be an optimistic estimate, given the 
province's past failure to meet earlier goals, such as opening new 
landfills so garbage would not have to be exported to Michigan. 
Unfortunately, even if processing capacity reaches 450,000 metric 
tons by the end of 2010, by that time Ontario is expected to produce 
some 500,000 metric tons of kitchen-based organic waste annually. 
While some of the extra 50,000 or more metric tons may end up in 
Quebec, Covanta Energy in New York is also a likely destination. 
 
¶12. (SBU) As the New York public becomes aware of the shipments, 
there may be a rising chorus of local complaints about odor, the 
stigma of being the recipient of another country's garbage, and 
perhaps the carbon footprint associated with transporting and 
incinerating the material (although transport and processing 
elsewhere in Ontario probably would result in a similar net carbon 
footprint).  If New York benefits economically from receiving the 
waste shipments - for example, via cheaper fuel for power generation 
and additional local jobs - officials there may wish to be prepared 
to quickly explain the benefits at such time as the shipments become 
a political issue.  End Comment.
