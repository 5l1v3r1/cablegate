SUBJECT: DRL DAS BARKS-RUGGLES DISCUSSES BMENA WITH FRENCH 
MFA, OCTOBER 25 
 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
 
¶1. (SBU) Visiting DRL DAS Erica Barks-Ruggles, accompanied by 
poloff and pol LES, met October 25 at the French MFA with 
DAS-equivalent for the Levant Ludovic Pouille, Director of 
the office of cooperation for the Middle East Jean-Michel 
Ledain, and the MFA's coordinator for BMENA Nicolas Fondraz 
to discuss BMENA issues.  She began by asking for impressions 
of the just-concluded sub-ministerial in Berlin, thoughts 
about how to improve cooperation between NGOs and 
governments, and views on Egyptian resistance and how to help 
make Egypt become more comfortable with BMENA. 
 
¶2. (SBU) With respect to Egypt, Ledain observed that the 
presence of activist Sa'ad Eddin Ibrahim had been a red flag 
for the government delegation.  In his view, the Egyptian 
attitude was less based on principle than on personality. 
Fondraz related a recent incident, which underscored Egyptian 
sensitivities, wherein an Egyptian activist started "having 
problems" after he received the French government's annual 
human rights award. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Fondraz asked for USG views on the proposed NGO 
principles and the upcoming BMENA ministerial in Yemen.  She 
expressed confidence in the level of support already given on 
the principles by several key governments and NGOs, but 
acknowledged the Egyptians might comment negatively on 
proposals circulating.  Ledain raised the problem for NGOs of 
financing from abroad.  Barks-Ruggles responded that 
documents circulating make the point that their provisions 
are based on previously-agreed commitments and exclude those 
groups supporting violence.  Pouille concurred, noting the 
"helpful" references to "lawful activities."  Fondraz 
asserted that seeking Arab consensus would be difficult. 
Barks-Ruggles noted that the effort to come up with voluntary 
undertakings is aimed at avoiding a new fight -- which NGOs 
do not want -- like that which happened over the Bahrain 
declaration.  When asked how many signatories the USG 
expects, Barks-Ruggles replied that the civil society 
component seems on board, and there appears to be good buy-in 
from the Gulf states and former BMENA hosts. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Fondraz, who agreed that the governments in the 
region need steady pressure to make progress, asked whether 
the next U.S. administration would continue the momentum 
BMENA has built up.  Barks-Ruggles firmly replied yes, 
affirming that progress in all the areas covered by BMENA was 
critical to the region's political evolution and to 
confronting extremist political forces.  In that spirit, she 
noted the need for G-8 support for BMENA initiatives. 
Fondraz noted in this context the early stages of France's 
initiative to create a Mediterranean Union that would 
complement much of what BMENA is doing. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Barks-Ruggles noted the Secretary's intention to 
attend the December 4-5 ministerial and strongly urged that 
FM Kouchner would do likewise.  Fondraz responded that the 
current French thinking was to send the NEA A/S-equivalent or 
his deputy.  Barks-Ruggles urged the French to reconsider 
their level of representation, pointing out that others in 
the G-8 (e.g., Germany) would send their foreign ministers to 
demonstrate the importance they attach to the effort. 
 
¶6. (SBU) DAS Barks-Ruggles has cleared this cable.
