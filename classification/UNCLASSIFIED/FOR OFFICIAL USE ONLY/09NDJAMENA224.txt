¶1.  (SBU)  Defense Attache and local staff attended a June 12 
ceremony during which the Chadian military (ANT) handed 84 
underage combatants, captured from Chadian rebel units in the 
course of early May ANT fighting with rebels in Eastern Chad, 
to UNICEF.  That organization will work in coordination with 
Care International to return the children to their families 
and ensure social reintegration.  MFA Moussa Faki Mahamat and 
MOD Kamougue Wadal Abdelkader co-presided over the ceremony, 
which was also attended by Chad's Ministers of Justice and 
Social Affairs, other members of the diplomatic corps, NGO 
reps, and former AU President (and President of Mali) Alpha 
Oumar Konare. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Both Faki and Kamougue emphasized that the GoC was 
committed to honoring its engagement to international 
conventions related to underage combatants, and that Chad 
would cooperate and assist NGOs and others from the 
international community in this regard.  Kamougue claimed 
retroactive credit for the GoC's having released 42 child 
soldiers from the Front Unite pour le Changement (FUC) taken 
prisoner in 1996 to UNICEF in that year, bringing the total 
number of underage combatants handed from the GOC to UNICEF 
to 557.  (This includes today's release of 84.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  UNICEF representatives who accepted the custody of 
the 84 children praised the GOC for its cooperation and made 
clear that UNICEF and Care International would work to assist 
with schooling and reestablishing links with family members. 
Former AU President Konare urged all Chadian groups not to 
allow children to engage in armed conflict.
