(SBU) Poloff conveyed points April 2 concerning Russian 
recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent 
states and plans to establish bases in these terrorities 
(ref. A) to Julian Juarez Cadenas, Deputy Director General 
for UN-Related Security and Legal Issues at the Foreign 
Secretariat (SRE). Juarez said that SRE's Russian 
interlocutors are fully aware that the Government of Mexico 
(GOM) is not in favor of recognizing these terrorities such 
that they no longer raise the issue.  He added that the GOM 
supports the August 12 and September 8 EU-brokered ceasefire 
agreements between Georgia and Russia.
