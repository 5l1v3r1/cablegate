REF: STATE 111082 
 
¶1. (SBU)  On June 24, Astana PO delivered reftel demarche to 
Yerlan Baudarbek-Kozhatayev, Office Director for Africa and 
Asia, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  (Note:  This office's 
responsibility includes the Middle East.)  PO emphasized 
U.S. appreciation for Kazakhstan's contribution to 
operations in Iraq and expressed U.S. interest in continuing 
that partnership. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Baudarbek-Kozhatayev told PO that Kazakhstan is 
committed to building stability in Iraq and noted President 
Nazarbayev's personal statements for Kazakhstan's de-mining 
contingent there.  Astana also hoped, he said, to see 
greater UN engagement in stabilization activities.  As a 
longer-term matter, Kazakhstan, he continued, is interested 
in participating in Iraq's economic rehabilitation.  (Note: 
Kazakhstan had planned to send a commercial delegation to 
Iraq in April 2004, but cancelled after the upsurge in 
violence in Fallujah.  End Note.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Baudarbek-Kozhatayev explained that MFA Deputy 
Minister Shakirov is in Brussels attending the Iraq 
conference.  He agreed to share points from reftel with 
Shakirov upon his return.
