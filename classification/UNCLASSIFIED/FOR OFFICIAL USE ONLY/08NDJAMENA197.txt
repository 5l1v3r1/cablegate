SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR USG ASSISTANCE TO CHADIAN NATIONAL 
INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION 
 
REF:  A) N'DJAMENA 149, B) N'DJAMENA-AF/C EMAILS 
 
¶1.  (U) THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE:  SEE PARA 6. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) THE USG COULD SIGNIFICANTLY SUPPORT THE "OPENING" OF THE 
CHADIAN INTERNAL POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT PROCESS BY   PROVIDING 
ASSISTANCE TO THE NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION SET UP TO SHED 
LIGHT ON EVENTS FOLLOWING THE FAILED REBEL ATTACK ON N'DJAMENA IN 
FEBRUARY, INCLUDING THE DETENTION BY CHADIAN SECURITY FORCES OF 
OPPOSITION PARTY LEADERS, AND ESPECIALLY THE CONTINUED DISAPPEARANCE 
OF OPPOSITION COALITION SPOKESMAN, MAHAMAT IBNI OUMAR SALEH. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD SEEK TO SEND A U.S. LEGAL/FORENSIC 
EXPERT TO ASSIST THE COMMISSION IN ITS WORK.  A U.S. EXPERT WITH A 
MILITARY BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE IN INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING 
MILITARY OPERATIONS WOULD BE A USEFUL COMPLEMENT TO THE CIVILIAN 
EXPERTS THAT THE EU AND FRANCE PLAN TO SEND TO CHAD TO ASSIST THE 
COMMISSION. 
 
¶4.  (U) THE COMMISSION IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ITS WORK MAY 1 AND 
FINISH UP ON JUNE 30.  WE HAVE CONSULTED WITH THE FRENCH AND EU 
MISSIONS, BOTH OF WHICH ENCOURAGED U.S. PARTICIPATION IN THE EFFORT 
TO ASSIST THE COMMISSION.  A USG EXPERT NEED NOT BE IN CHAD FOR THE 
ENTIRE TWO-MONTH PERIOD; EVEN A THREE- TO FOUR-WEEK STAY WOULD BE 
EXTREMELY USEFUL. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD ALSO DEMARCHE THE UN IN NY AND 
GENEVA TO ENCOURAGE PROVISION OF EXPERT ASSISTANCE TO THE CHADIAN 
NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION BY THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICE IN 
GENEVA.  BOTH THE EU AND FRANCE HAVE MADE SIMILAR DEMARCHES, 
ACCORDING TO THEIR REPRESENTATIVES HERE. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  THAT THE DEPARTMENT (A) SEND A U.S. 
LEGAL/HUMAN RIGHTS/FORENSIC EXPERT (POSSIBLY WITH A MILITARY 
BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE) TO ASSIST THE CHADIAN NATIONAL 
INVESTIGATIVE COMMISSION IN ITS WORK; AND (B) DEMARCHE THE UN IN NY 
AND GENEVA TO ENCOURAGE PROVISION OF EXPERT ASSISTANCE TO THE 
COMMISSION BY THE UN HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICE IN GENEVA. NIGRO
