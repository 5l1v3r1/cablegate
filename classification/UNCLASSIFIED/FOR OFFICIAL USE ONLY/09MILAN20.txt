¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  The Democratic Party (PD) in Northern 
Italy hopes to offset likely losses in the June EU 
parliamentary elections with some significant wins in the 
accompanying local elections where the individual popularity 
of candidates matters more.  Key to this strategy would be 
the reelection of the popular Mayor Flavio Zanonato in 
populous, economically-strategic Padua.  However, with the 
center-right all but certain to name a strong challenger and 
Democratic Party popularity still in the gutter, the Mayor's 
reelection campaign is shaping up to be a tight race.  End 
summary. 
 

¶2.  (SBU) Padua's popular center-left mayor, Flavio Zanonato, 
is (along with Turin's Sergio Chiamparino) a rare bright spot 
for the Democratic Party in otherwise resoundingly 
center-right Northern Italy.  However, Democratic Party 
support appears to be fading ahead of administrative 
elections in June.  Zanonato, as a dedicated leftist, is an 
anomaly in Padua, which has traditionally had a center-right 
political bent.  Still, during his five-year tenure, Mayor 
Zanonato has built his support base largely through decided 
actions to close down and remove (and relocate within Padua) 
residents from a ghettoized immigrant neighborhood that had 
become a haven for drug traffickers.  Local journalists and 
politicians from both sides of the political spectrum note 
that Zanonato will be going into his campaign for reelection 
next June from a position of strength. 
 

¶3.  (SBU) Even with a strong and very popular candidate in 
Zanonato the Democratic Party will face a very tight race to 
keep hold of one of its only mayors in a significant northern 
city.  Zanonato took advantage of a temporarily weak 
center-right united behind an unpopular mayor to win the last 
election.  The climate is significantly different now, with 
the Democratic Party generally in disarray after sweeping 
losses in the April 2008 national elections, and a likely 
high-profile, popular center-right candidate to oppose 
Zanonato - Mario Bertolissi, a well-regarded constitutional 
lawyer and professor hand-picked by Veneto Regional President 
Giancarlo Galan (the most prominent center-right politician 
in the region).  Similarly, Zanonato's popularity shows 
little sign of spreading to help the party win other local 
elections such as the presidency of Padua Province. 

¶4.  (SBU) Comment: The anticipated closeness of the race for 
the popular Zanonato,s seat before the center-right has even 
formally announced a candidate is emblematic of the 
Democratic Party's overall struggle to shore up its base in 
northern Italy let alone gain new supporters.  The local 
administrative and EU parliamentary elections in June will be 
the first major electoral test since the center-left's defeat 
in all regions of Northern Italy last April.  Coupled with an 
expected further drop in support for the Democratic Party in 
the EU elections, the loss of one of a very few significant 
mayorships in Northern Italy would be politically 
embarrassing and demoralizing for an already moribund party. 
Like other provincial and regional elections, the PD is 
forced to rely in Padua on its candidate's personal 
popularity because of the party's continuing struggles. End 
comment.
