¶1.  (SBU) Ambassador Mozena conveyed reftel demarche on July 
25 to Carlos Fonseca, Diplomatic Advisor to President Dos 
Santos, underscoring that the will of the Zimbabwe people, as 
expressed during the March 29 election, must be respected as 
efforts continue to resolve the Zimbabwe crisis and that 
President Mugabe could not be part of any transitional 
government.  Fonseca took the demarche on board, said he 
would convey it to others, and thanked the ambassador for 
conveying the US perspective of this "difficult" issue. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Later the same day, Mozena delivered the same 
demarche to Paulo Jorge, the MPLA Secretary for International 
Relations, highlighting the need for continued Angolan 
engagement on Zimbabwe to encourage President Mugabe to make 
a dignified departure now from office.  Mozena added that 
Mugabe could not be part of any transitional government. 
Jorge, who has figured prominently in GRA deliberations on 
Zimbabwe policy, agreed that it is hard to imagine a 
transitional government that included Mugabe, but added that 
it was unlikely that Mugabe would step down.  Jorge said 
Angola is "gently advising Mugabe on various courses of 
action," and he mentioned a possible "Kenya" resolution. 
Mozena noted that a Kenya approach could not work in 
Zimbabwe, underscoring that Mugabe is the problem and not 
part of the solution.  Jorge said Angola will remain engaged 
during the coming two-week negotiation period to support a 
solution to the Zimbabwe situation.  He added that a meeting 
of select SADC countries would be held soon (NFI on dates or 
participants) to support the negotiations.  Jorge said Angola 
continues to base its Zimbabwe policy on the need to stop the 
violence there and for the government and opposition MDC to 
reach a negotiated settlement.
