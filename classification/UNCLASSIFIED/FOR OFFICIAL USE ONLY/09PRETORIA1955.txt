COSATU Presses ANC for Ruling Alliance Summit 
¶2. (U) At the annual Congress of the Congress of South African Trade 
Unions (COSATU), COSATU General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi called for 
the withdrawal of a Green Paper on Strategic Planning tabled by the 
Minister in the Presidency Trevor Manuel.  COSATU accused Manuel of 
over-stepping his authority and marginalizing ruling alliance 
members COSATU and the South African Communist Party (SACP).  COSATU 
charged that the former finance minister's plans, if implemented, 
would make Manuel the country's de-facto Prime Minister.  The 
African National Congress National Executive Committee (ANC NEC), 
which had previously endorsed the Green Paper, agreed to a ruling 
alliance (ANC-COSATU-SACP) summit  to discuss the document. (The 
Times, September, 20, 2009) 
 
Suspension of Local Officials Compounds Service Delivery Problems 
¶3. (U) According to an analysis done by the Cooperative Governance 
and Traditional Affairs department, the mass suspension of top 
officials following a wave of service delivery protests has harmed 
service delivery.  The analysis shows that the suspension of senior 
staffers without immediate replacement has affected service delivery 
targets in affected municipalities.  Cooperative Governance and 
Traditional Affairs departmental spokesman Simphiwe Kunene told 
local media that on the basis of these findings, his department 
would provide experts and support to strengthen the capacities of 
all under staffed municipalities by December. (The Times, September, 
25, 2009) 
 
Defense Minister Appoints Military Service Commission; Bows to 
Pressure to Keep Military Unions 
¶4. (U) Minister of Defense and Military Veterans Lindiwe Sisulu 
announced on September 21 the appointment of a ten-member Military 
Service Commission to regulate the conditions of service of all 
South African National Defense Force (SANDF) personnel.   Sisulu 
announced that the Military Service Commission will be chaired by 
High Court Judge Ronnie Bosielo, who would assist in developing new 
military standards for salaries, recruitment, transfers, promotions 
and dismissals.  Sisulu insisted that the commission would not 
replace military unions but would create a separate bargaining 
chamber for soldiers.  Commission members include United Democratic 
Front Leader Bantu Holimisa, Freedom Front Plus MP Pieter 
Groenewald, and ANC MP Hlengiwe Mgabadeli. 
 
Controversial Judge Hlophe Fails to Secure Constitutional Court 
Nomination 
¶5.  South Africa's Judicial Service Commission put an end to months 
of controversy and agonized debate on the politicization of the 
judiciary when it released its short list of candidate for the 
Constitutional Court.  The name of Cape Judge President John Hlophe, 
accused of lobbying the court on behalf of then-ANC President Jacob 
Zuma, who then faced corruption charges, was not among the seven 
candidates recommended for appointment to South Africa's highest 
court (Pretoria News, September 22.
