DEMARCHE DELIVERED: UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION REF: STATE 106225 (SBU) On October 19, we delivered reftel points to MFA Deputy Director for International Legal Affairs and Conventions Ibrahim El-Diwany, urging Egypt to join the international consensus on a transparent and effective review mechanism for the UN Convention Against Corruption at the November 9-13 Doha Conference. El-Diwany had no substantive response, and said that the Public Prosecutor's office has the lead on the issue. At El-Diwany's request, we sent the MFA a dipnote on October 21 that requested a meeting with Judge Ahmed El-Deniri at the Public Prosecutor's office and included reftel talking points as a nonpaper for Judge El-Deniri. El-Diwany confirmed that the Public Prosecutor's office received the dipnote. We will deliver reftel demarche to the Public Prosecutor's office in person when we are granted a meeting. Scobey
