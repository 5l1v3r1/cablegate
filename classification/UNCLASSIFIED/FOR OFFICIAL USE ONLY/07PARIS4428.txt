SUBJECT: SARKOZY HEARS FISHERMEN'S COMPLAINTS BEFORE TRAVELING TO 
U.S. 
 
¶1. (U) Nicholas Sarkozy traveled to Brittany to meet with fishermen 
protesting the increased cost of diesel fuel just before his 
departure for the United States Tuesday November 6.  In a 
contentious meeting-punctuated by protesters' insults and 
presidential disdain and anger in response, Sarkozy proposed a 
compensatory six-month suspension of employer taxes that he 
estimated was worth 21 million euros.  He also said that Agriculture 
and Fisheries Minister Michel Barnier would work on a new mechanism 
to facilitate passing cost increase to consumers, replacing a 
previous subsidy invalidated by the EU in January of 2007. 
 
¶2. (SBU) French fishermen do not pay either fuel tax or VAT on 
diesel fuel. Because of this relatively lower cost recent increases 
have hit them proportionally harder than the average French 
consumer, with fuel costs consuming approximately 40% of their 
revenue. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Sarkozy demonstrated both strong commitment to 
defend his reform agenda with an angry constituency and flexibility 
in proposing some industry-specific measures to calm the fishermen a 
week before major announced transportation and energy strikes. 
Sarkozy hopes to avoid additional labor unrest and to prevent a 
coalescence of protests that could derail his reform efforts. 
Sarkozy also seeks to sidestep further politicization of the high 
cost of energy, given his government's current refusal to lower high 
energy taxes on both budgetary and environmental grounds.  But by 
putting himself yet again on the front lines, Sarkozy risks drawing 
the fire of yet another narrow, but strongly motivated, 
constituency.  While the various groups opposed to aspects of the 
Sarkozy reform program - transport workers, civil servants, teachers 
-- have yet to make common cause, the more frequently the president 
puts himself in the position of negotiator-in-chief, the more likely 
that becomes.
