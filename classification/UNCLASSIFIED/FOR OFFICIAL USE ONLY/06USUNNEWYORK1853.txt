SUBJECT: UNSC/SUDAN: UNMIS MANDATE EXTENDED UNTIL OCTOBER 8 
 
¶1. (SBU) On September 22, the United Nations Security Council 
unanimously adopted resolution 1709, renewing the mandate of 
the UN Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) for a period of two 
weeks.  Delegates from the Chinese, Qatari and Russian 
Missions reiterated concerns in consultations immediately 
preceding the adoption about inclusion in the resolution of 
reference to UNSCR 1706, which China and Qatar argue refers 
to Darfur and should be 'de-linked' from the Council's 
consideration of the rest of the Sudan.  Ambassador Sanders 
successfully advanced our views on the indivisibility of 
Sudan peace and the legal requirement to include a reference 
to UNSCR 1706.  Resolution S/RES/1709 (2006) was adopted by a 
vote of 15 in favor and zero opposed. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin resolution text: 
 
The Security Council, 
 
Recalling its previous resolutions, in particular resolutions 
1706 (2006) of 31 August 2006, 1679 (2006) of 16 May 2006, 
1663 (2006) of 24 March 2006, 1653 of 27 January 2006, 1627 
of 23 September 2005 and 1590 (2005) of 24 March 2005, and 
the statements of its President, in particular that of 3 
February 2006 (S/PRST/2006/5), concerning the situation in 
the Sudan, 
 
Reaffirming its commitment to the sovereignty, unity, 
independence and territorial integrity of the Sudan and to 
the cause of peace, 
 
Noting with deep concern the restrictions placed on movements 
and materiel of the United Nations Mission in the Sudan 
(UNMIS) and the adverse impact such restrictions have on 
UNMIS' ability to perform its mandate effectively, 
 
Expressing its grave concern over the continued deterioration 
of the humanitarian situation in Darfur and reiterating in 
the strongest terms the need for all parties to the conflict 
in Darfur to put and end to the violence and atrocities in 
that region, 
 
Determining that the situation in the Sudan continues to 
constitute a threat to international peace and security, 
 
Decides to extend the mandate of UNMIS until 8 October 2006, 
with the intention to renew it for further periods; 
 
Decides to remain actively seized of the matter. 
 
¶3. (U) End resolution text.
