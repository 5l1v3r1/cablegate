SUBJECT: TURKEY: 2006 DOMESTIC REPORT ON COMBATING HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING IN TURKEY 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The GOT recently issued its 2006 Report on 
Combating Human Trafficking in Turkey.  The report provides 
an overview of Turkey's anti-TIP legal framework, 
international cooperation mechanisms, TIP prevention and 
victim protection measures, and supporting 2006 statistical 
data.  The report, published in Turkish and English, is the 
first "domestic" TIP report produced by the GOT, and a good 
example of the close interagency cooperation the GOT has 
fostered through its anti-TIP taskforce.  The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, Police, Jandarma, Ministry of Justice, and 
IOM, along with the Human Resources Development Fund and the 
Foundation for Women's Solidarity (the two NGOs operating 
Turkey's two dedicated TIP shelters), all contributed to the 
report.  IOM also funded the printing.  IOM Chief of Mission 
Maurizio Busatti told us that he hopes future annual reports 
will be released earlier in the year and explore in greater 
depth the TIP issue in Turkey.  He conceded that this first 
report was mostly gloss.  IOM Trafficking Assistant Meltem 
Ersoy noted optimistically that the GOT interagency taskforce 
has already created a technical working group tasked with the 
production of subsequent TIP reports.

G/TIP.
