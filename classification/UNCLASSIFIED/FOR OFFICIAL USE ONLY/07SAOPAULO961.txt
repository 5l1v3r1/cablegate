SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) Results in the Workers' Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores - 
PT) internal elections on December 2 confirm that the old centrist 
Majority Camp, associated with President Lula and the inner circle 
of his first term, no longer commands a majority of the party 
faithful or the leadership, but nonetheless retains considerable 
influence within the PT.  The PT announced the evening of December 4 
that incumbent national president Ricardo Berzoini of the majority 
CNB faction, finished first in the party's December 2 internal 
elections with 43.75 percent of the valid vote, followed by his 
fellow Sao Paulo federal deputy, Jilmar Tatto, with 20.51 percent. 
However, Berzoini fell short of the 50 percent required for a 
first-round victory and faces a December 16 runoff against Tatto. 
It is possible that all six also-rans will join forces to try to 
defeat Berzoini in the second round; however, he may be able to make 
a deal with either the second- or third-place finisher to secure his 
victory.  The PT continues to command the loyalties of about 16-18 
percent of the electorate, and is strong among the working class and 
the poor, but faces significant challenges as it looks towards the 
2010 elections without President Lula as a candidate.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Workers' Party (PT) members went to the polls nationwide 
December 2 to elect national, state, and local presidents and 
tickets which will form the basis for PT Directorates and 
Commissions.  Preliminary estimates are that about 325,000 of the 
917,000 registered party members, or 35 percent, turned out to vote, 
slightly more than in the 2005 elections.  The presidents and their 
tickets are elected for three-year terms.  These elections were 
originally scheduled for late 2008, but the party decided at its 
National Congress (ref B) to move them up a year to de-conflict them 
from the 2008 municipal elections.  Unlike the 2005 elections (refs 
F and G), this year's balloting was not held in a crisis atmosphere, 
as the Lula/PT political corruption scandals are now old news. 
Nevertheless, the PT is in a difficult situation as it prepares for 
the 2010 elections for President, Governors, and federal and state 
legislators all but certain that President Lula will not be a 
candidate for office for the first time in PT history.  It is 
uncertain whether the party will be able to field a viable 
presidential candidate of its own. 
 
------------------- 
SHORT OF A MAJORITY 
------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) With the vote count all but final, former Labor Minister 
Ricardo Berzoini is leading the race to win another term as PT 
national president, but has fallen short of the 50 percent needed to 
win in the first round.  He will contest a December 16 runoff 
against Sao Paulo federal deputy Jilmar Tatto, who garnered 20.5 
percent.  Berzoini represents the PT's largest faction, the centrist 
Constructing a New Brazil (CNB), formerly known as the Majority 
Camp, whereas Tatto is running under an umbrella coalition  - "Party 
is for Fighting" - composed of his own faction, "PT for Struggles 
and Masses," allied with the moderate "PT Movement" and the more 
leftist "New Course" tendencies.  Struggles and Masses and New 
Course are both Sao Paulo-centered organizations loyal to Tourism 
 
SAO PAULO 00000961  002 OF 003 
 
 
Minister (and former Sao Paulo Mayor, 2001-04) Marta Suplicy.  PT 
Movement is led by Maria do Rosario Nunes, a Federal Deputy from Rio 
Grande do Sul (RS), where the PT is very strong, and Arlindo 
Chinaglia of Sao Paulo, President of the Chamber of Deputies.  Tatto 
made an extremely strong showing in Sao Paulo state, home to about a 
third of PT members, outpolling Berzoini here by about 48 to 32 
percent. 
 
¶4.  (U) Jose Eduardo Martins Cardozo (see ref A), another Federal 
Deputy from Sao Paulo, finished third with just under 19 percent, 
and has thus been eliminated from the runoff.  The PT's Secretary 
for International Relations, Valter Pomar of "Hope is Red," got 
11.43 percent, with three militant socialist and Trotskyite 
candidates splitting the remaining five percent. 
 
¶5.  (U) The balloting for "chapas" or tickets whose members will 
serve on the National Directorate (DN) and various party committees 
followed loosely the presidential vote.  Berzoini's ticket, CNB, got 
42.91 percent of the vote, with Tatto's "Party is for Fighting" 
scoring 19.69 percent and Cardozo's "Message to the Party" at 16.84. 
 Accordingly, CNB, formerly known as the Majority Camp, has won 34 
of the 81 elected seats on the DN and will have to negotiate deals 
with other factions to secure a majority when voting on party 
business. 
 
---------------- 
A BITTER RIVALRY 
---------------- 
 
¶6.  (U) Going into the race, all the opposition candidates except 
third-place finisher Cardozo pledged that, in the event of a second 
round, they would unite against Berzoini and CNB.  Cardozo has not 
yet made his position known.  His "Message to the Party" faction, 
led by Justice Minister Tarso Genro and supported by such party 
luminaries as Bahia Governor Jaques Wagner and former RS Governor 
Olivio Dutra, is a bitter opponent of the CNB and of its de facto 
leader, former Lula Chief of Staff Jose Dirceu.  (Note: Dirceu 
resigned under a cloud in June 2005 and was subsequently expelled 
from Congress and deprived for eight years of his political rights. 
The Supreme Federal Tribunal recently indicted him on corruption 
charges related to his alleged leadership role in the "mensalao" 
(Big Monthly Payoff) vote-buying scandal.  End Note.)  The "Message" 
faction is named after a manifesto published by Genro in February 
(ref E) calling for the "re-founding" of the PT with a more robust 
ethical posture, and blaming the Majority Camp (now CNB) for the 
corruption scandals that so badly damaged the PT's reputation. 
 
¶7.  (U) Apparently not eager to make a deal with Cardozo and 
"Message," Berzoini and his allies are reportedly reaching out to 
Jilmar Tatto and his faction to explore the possibility of a modus 
vivendi that would avoid a contentious, possibly fratricidal second 
round.  Any agreement would involve sharing power and leadership 
positions.  Tatto and his coalition are champions of strengthening 
the party's base and running a PT candidate for president in 2010. 
The CNB, as the faction closest to President Lula, favors his 
approach of identifying the most viable candidate from any of the 
parties in his governing coalition, not necessarily the PT. 
Berzoini and the CNB might emerge stronger with Tatto and his 
friends as partners rather than as defeated rivals, but whether they 
can come to an agreement remains to be seen.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Ironically, Berzoini was not even President Lula's first 
 
SAO PAULO 00000961  003 OF 003 
 
 
choice for PT President.  He has been derided by many PT militants 
as a weak leader who was further weakened by allegations of his 
participation in the 2006 "dossier" scandal, in which PT members and 
Lula campaign workers allegedly purchased a false dossier ginned up 
to embarrass Sao Paulo gubernatorial candidate Jose Serra.  By all 
accounts, Lula preferred his foreign affairs advisor, PT First 
Vice-President Marco Aurelio Garcia, who ran the party during 
Berzoini's enforced leave of absence.  However, Garcia faced 
opposition from within CNB and never launched a candidacy, and Lula 
grudgingly accepted Berzoini, who now faces the difficult task of 
leading the PT through the 2008 municipal elections and into the 
2010 campaign. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) When Berzoini and the Majority Camp won the 2005 internal 
elections, a number of leftists, some of them quite prominent PT 
founders and long-time leaders, defected to Heloisa Helena's 
Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL).  Nothing so drastic is expected 
to happen this time.  If Berzoini prevails, the PT will continue to 
chart a pragmatic, centrist course, supporting the Lula 
administration's moderate governance, with the left wing and the 
social movements continuing to articulate vocal criticism of the 
government's economic policies even while remaining essentially 
loyal.  The "Message" faction will agitate for internal party reform 
from a minority position, making scant progress.  Jilmar Tatto, for 
his part, is known as an urban machine politician without strongly 
held ideological views, but some of his supporters are to the left 
of center.  Were they to hold the reins of power in the PT, they 
would likely push for more progressive economic policies.  More to 
the point, a Tatto presidency would significantly increase Marta 
Suplicy's clout within the party leadership and her chances of being 
the PT's 2010 presidential candidate.  At the moment, she is still 
deliberating over whether to make another run for Mayor of Sao Paulo 
next year. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Regardless of which candidate wins, the PT will likely 
continue to command the loyalties of about 16-18 percent of voters 
nationwide, as evidenced by its 2006 Congressional vote, and to 
remain strong among the poor and the working class and in certain 
states and regions.  If the economy remains strong and Lula's second 
term is viewed as successful, the PT may fare well in 2010.  For 
now, however, it is struggling to find a leader or a theme to rally 
around.  End Comment.
