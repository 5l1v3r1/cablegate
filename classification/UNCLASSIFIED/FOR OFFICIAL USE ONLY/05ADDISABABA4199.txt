¶1.  This is an action request.  See paragraph 7. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary:  According to African Union (AU) Peace and 
Security Commissioner Amb. Said Djinnit, the AU Peace and 
Security Council (PSC) will meet January 12 to decide the 
future of AMIS.  Addis-based AU partners are seeking guidance 
from capitals on how to promote a positive PSC outcome, which 
would give the UN a green light to plan blue-hatting of AMIS 
in 2006.  The AU's desire for frank dialogue on AMIS also 
presents the opportunity to ensure more strategic-level 
thinking on implementing December 2005 assessment mission 
recommendations, including securing AU requests for NATO and 
other partner assistance.  End summary. 
 
-------------------- 
THE CLOCK IS TICKING 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) On December 23, AU Peace and Security Commissioner 
Djinnit responded to a letter sent by British Ambassador 
Dewar on behalf of all partners supporting AMIS.  According 
to Djinnit, the AU PSC will meet January 12 to consider the 
AU Commission report on Darfur ahead of the January 20 
expiration of AMIS' mandate.  (Note:  AU officials have 
informed partners that the Commission's report will include 
relevant extracts of the December AU-led assessment mission, 
an analysis of the Abuja Political Talks, and advice from AU 
Legal on the relationship between the AU and International 
Criminal Court activity on Darfur.)  End note. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The December assessment mission report is still with 
Amb. Djinnit for final approval, but contains a key paragraph 
on AMIS transition: 
 
-- "It is further recommended that early consideration be 
given to all viable alternatives for maintaining a peace 
support operation in Darfur.  It should, however, be borne in 
mind that if other institutions are to be involved, an early 
start to contingency planning will be required.  In any case 
it is inevitable that AMIS presence in Darfur will be 
maintained for the next 6-9 months.  In the longer term, a 
single operation covering the whole of Sudan including a 
settlement in the east will bring coherence and synergy, in 
addition to facilitating integration of increasingly complex 
political, humanitarian and military effort."

COMMENT:  ENGAGEMENT FROM POST AND DEPARTMENT NEEDED 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) In the run-up to the January 12 PSC meeting on 
Darfur, Post recommends continued efforts to assess PSC and 
other key AU member state views on the future of AMIS. 
Charge will be hosting a lunch with selected PSC Ambassadors 
January 10, which should present a timely opportunity to 
assess and influence.  Per partner request, Amb. Djinnit has 
designated Darfur Integrated Task Force (DITF) Political Head 
Solomon Gomez and Military Head Col. Mbaye the main points of 
contact for partner interface while the liaison group is on 
recess.  Post believes that continued senior-level engagement 
with the AU on the issue of AMIS future will be critical. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The AU needs reassurance that partners are committed 
to enhancing African peacekeeping capability in the period 
before transition to a UN mission in Darfur, through seeking 
the re-hatting of some AU troops, and in the future through 
the African Standby Force and other AU-led efforts.  The 
liaison group, which meets twice-weekly with the AU to pursue 
Darfur objectives, can be reconfigured as a working group to 
assist the AU with implementing mutually-agreed priorities 
from the assessment mission recommendations.  Reinvigorating 
the liaison group will require AU willingness to dialogue on 
strategic issues and to accept additional partner technical 
assistance, including a request for NATO expertise for 
command and control functions.  It will also require closer 
coordination between capitals and partner embassies in Addis 
Ababa. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Post looks forward to working with Washington and 
key partners to bring about a positive and supportable PSC

decision, as well as to improve AMIS capacity to address 
challenges in Darfur before a hopeful UN transition.
