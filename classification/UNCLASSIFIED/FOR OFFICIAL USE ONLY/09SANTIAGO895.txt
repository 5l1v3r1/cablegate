UNGA Third Committee 
 
------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Poloff and Canadian Second Secretary Meghan Pelton 
jointly delivered Ref A demarche on UNGA Third Committee priorities 
to MFA Human Rights Deputy Director Gerardo Ateaga on November 4. 
Ateaga made the following observations about Chile's priorities and 
positions in the Third Committee: 
 
--Chile consistently opposes no-action motions because they stifle 
debate of important issues. 
 
--Chile will support country-specific resolutions on Iran, Burma, 
and DPRK.  Chile is particularly concerned about the plight of 
Bahais in Iran, and would like to see language specifically 
addressing anti-Bahai discrimination and freedom of religion in the 
Iran resolution. 
 
--Ateaga was unfamiliar with the biennial U.S. elections resolution 
and would appreciate more information in Spanish about this 
resolution. 
 
--Ateaga was pleased to hear that the U.S. would be working to find 
common ground on the Rights of the Child resolution and was eager 
to be supportive of these efforts. 
 
--Chile recently shifted its position on the defamation of 
religions issue.  In the past, Chile has abstained on such votes. 
Last month, Chile voted no on a defamations of religions resolution 
at the UN Human Rights Council--the first time Chile has cast a no 
vote on this issue.  This change was motivated by concerns that the 
issue is structured specifically to protect Islam and not other 
religions.  Chile plans to vote against the resolution in the Third 
Committee. 
 
 
 
Goldstone Report 
 
----------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Poloff also delivered Ref B points about the Goldstone 
Report to Ateaga on November 4.    Ateaga agreed with USG concerns 
that efforts to have the UNGA refer the matter to another 
body--such as the International Court of Justice or the 
International Criminal Court--would overstep the Assembly's 
authority.  Chile also opposes encouraging the convocation of 
parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention.   However, Chile is not 
opposed to language which would endorse or welcome the report, and 
noted that efforts are underway to find compromise language which 
is positive about the report but falls short of "fully endorsing" 
the report.  Chile has not yet decided how it will vote on a 
resolution.  Ultimately, the decision will depend on the final text 
of the resolution and will be a political decision, likely made by 
MFA Undersecretary Alberto Van Klaveren.  Ateaga agreed to share 
USG concerns with Van Klaveren.
