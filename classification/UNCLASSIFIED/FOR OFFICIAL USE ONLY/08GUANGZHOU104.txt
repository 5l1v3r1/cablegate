¶1. (SBU) Summary: At the request of Embassy Beijing, the Consul 
General Goldberg formally expressed U.S. concern about the physical 
attack on Huang Qingnan, the Director of Dongzhe Work Safety and 
Health Center, to Guangdong provincial officials.  He urged them to 
look into Huang's case as well as into the cases of others who have 
similarly been abused, threatened or attacked while working on 
behalf of China's workers.  Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office 
Director General Fu Lang contended that local authorities had taken 
prompt action and expressed the Guangdong Government's commitment to 
protecting workers' rights.  He argued that the province's large 
migrant population made law enforcement difficult.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Consul General coupled his formal expression of concern 
about the specific case of labor activist Huang Qingnan with an 
observation that such attacks on those who are in fact promoting 
China's rule of law and building a harmonious society efforts 
through assistance to the most disadvantaged had in fact increased. 
(Note: As reported ref A, Huang was attacked on November 20 by 
knife-wielding thugs -- the latest in a serious of escalating 
attacks aimed at closing the NGO he runs.  End note.)  He noted that 
it was essential for Guangdong's police and legal system to protect 
organizations and individuals at increased risk of victimization. 
The Consul General urged provincial officials to look into the case 
and asked for future updates on its status. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Fu, who had been well briefed on the facts of the case, 
expressed sympathy for Huang but contended that local police had 
taken prompt action.  He argued that undertaking an effective 
investigation had taken time, emphasizing that police had eventually 
arrested the man who orchestrated the attack.  Fu explained that 
investigations had concluded that the main suspect had arranged the 
attack because he believed that Huang's activities had cut into his 
business profits.  Fu also said that officials from the local Civil 
Affairs Bureau and Trade Unions Federation had visited Huang to 
express their sympathy and assure that he received proper treatment. 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Guangdong Government, its law enforcement agencies and 
criminal justice system are committed to protecting labor rights and 
punishing criminal activity that threatens those rights, Fu said. 
He cited the new Labor Law, effective January 1, as evidence of the 
high priority the Chinese Government places on the rights and 
interests of workers, especially migrant workers. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Pointing out that nearly 20 million migrants live in 
Guangdong province, Fu said the huge transient population made it 
difficult for law enforcement agencies to maintain public security. 
He commented that many violent cases like the attack on Huang take 
place every day.  He acknowledged that the local public security 
situation remains unsatisfactory despite constant effort by local 
police, but suggested that China was in a period of transition in 
terms of labor issues and we would really only be able to judge 
success as China moved toward better enforcement of labor rights.
