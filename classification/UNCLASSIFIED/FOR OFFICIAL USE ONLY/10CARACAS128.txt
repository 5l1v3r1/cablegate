REF: EMAIL BASHNAN/LEWIS DTD 02/17/10; CARACAS PSA COST ANALYSIS 
CARACAS PROPOSED SCHEDULE A AND CARACAS LOCAL COMPENSATION PLAN 
 
¶1.   Post has received DS request (REFTEL A) that Post provide 
additional information about Post's proposal to convert the Local 
Guard Force (LGF) program from contractor provided to Personal 
Services Agreement (PSA).  Answers provided are keyed to REFTEL A. 
REFTEL B contains the completed cost benefit analysis spread sheet 
for FY 10 by function code, proposed schedule A, and the local 
compensation plan. 
 
¶A.   DS requested that Post provide an updated PSA cost benefit 
analysis reflecting estimated costs and projected savings that 
would be realized if the local guard force is converted from 
contract to PSA.  Using the provided costs benefit analysis 
template (REFTEL B), we estimate a cost savings of $1,901,700 in 
the first initial year and $3,390,200 each additional year for a 
total $15.4M over the life of a five year contract.  This is based 
on a new contract being negotiated at the rate of the current 
bridge contract. 
 
¶B.  DS requested confirmation that Post's financial (FMO) and human 
resource (HR) offices have agreed to accept the additional 
responsibility of managing and supporting administrative 
requirements for a PSA local guard force.  Post has agreed to 
provide administrative support for the conversion.  Per the ICASS 
software it appears that Post will need to hire two additional 
positions to support the added work load; one in HR and one in FMO. 
The direct costs of the positions will be $69,750.  If there is a 
question as to the new DS invoice under ICASS, post will forward 
via email. 
 
¶D.  DS requested that Post provide an updated schedule A (Guard 
Schedule) that clearly identifies how many guard personnel will be 
needed to staff each guard post, taking into account the local 
compensation plan requirements to provide the PSA guards with the 
required annual sick leave, vacation time, holidays and to meet 
guard training requirements.  Post referred to 12 FAH-7, Appendix 
II-2 (Determining staffing requirements) for guidance on 
determining the appropriate staffing levels for the PSA guard 
program.  We have determined that 147 LGF positions are required to 
maintain post security posture (See Reftel C). 
 
¶E.  DS requested that Post provide a copy of Post's local 
compensation plan and LES payment schedule via e-mail.  REFTEL C 
contains the updated schedule A and the local compensation plan. 
 
¶F.  DS requested that post identify the appropriate function codes 
(5826, 5821, 5822 and 5823) for the cost benefit analysis and 
schedule A (Guard Schedule) and use them to account for the local 
guard positions and the total estimated cost projections and 
savings for ICASS and Non-ICASS.  Post complied; see attachments in 
REFTEL B. 
 
¶G.  Post confirms and acknowledges RSO responsibility to provide 
the PSA local guards with the appropriate training and 
certification.  Post will refer to 12 FAH-7 H-513 (Guard Training) 
and 12 FAH-7 H-520 (U.S. Government Provided Training) for 
additional information on training PSA local guards. 
 
¶2.  Point of contact at Post is RSO Wendy Bashnan, telephone number 
58-212-907-8403.  Regards.
