Â¶1.  On June 8, PolOff delivered talking points and a copy of 
the Swiss circular to MFA Human Rights Director Carmen 
Larrea.  The document recommends a conference to discuss a 
Third Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions granting 
the Magen David Adom (MDA) full membership in the 
International Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement.  Larrea told 
PolOff on June 13 that she expected the GOE would support the 
conference and protocol as they support the GOE's policy of 
advocating humanitarian goals.  PolOff encouraged Larrea to 
support the conference as the issue has been ready for 
closure since 2000 and it would increase humanitarian 
workers' safety.  Larrea will notify PolOff once a final 
decision is made.
