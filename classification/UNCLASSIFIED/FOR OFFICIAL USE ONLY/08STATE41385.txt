SUBJECT: SOMALIA: FOLLOW-UP ON RESTRUCTURING THE 
INTERNATIONAL CONTACT GROUP 
 
REF: STATE 16168 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request, please see paragraph 2. 
 
OBJECTIVES 
---------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Posts are asked to approach host countries and 
relevant international organizations to pursue the following 
objectives: 
 
-- Inform participants of the International Contact Group 
(ICG) on Somalia that a broad consensus has been reached 
regarding the need to restructure the ICG to ensure its 
effectiveness as both an action-oriented group and as a 
coordinating mechanism; and 
 
-- Notify ICG participants that the hand over to the United 
Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
(SRSG) as Chair of the Contact Group will take place 
following the next high-level meeting on April 30 in Oslo. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
¶3. (SBU) ICG participants have agreed to our initial approach 
to restructure the ICG (reftel) by turning over the 
chairmanship to UN SRSG Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, who has agreed 
to assume chair after the ICG's next meeting.  Since early 
March, the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, and 
European Commission have participated in several conference 
calls to discuss the structure of a reformed ICG, during 
which it was agreed that Norway would host the next 
high-level ICG meeting to facilitate the hand-off to SRSG 
Ould-Abdallah.  It was also agreed that the SRSG must have 
maximum flexibility under the restructured ICG to establish 
sub-groups under the ICG on specific issues or initiatives, 
as well as bring new participants into these sub-groups, to 
best achieve specific policy goals.  While ICG members may 
have a desire to participate in certain sub-groups, it will 
be up to the SRSG to determine the composition of these 
groups. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Posts are asked to inform host country and regional 
organization counterparts that a consensus has been reached 
and will be implemented following the next high-level ICG 
meeting in Oslo on April 30.  Norway extended invitations to 
this meeting on Tuesday, April 15. Countries and 
organizations invited to participate in the April 30 meeting 
are: the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, 
Tanzania, Kenya, Egypt, Yemen, Canada, Ethiopia, the African 
Union, the United Nations, the Arab League, the European 
Union, and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development 
(IGAD). The Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of Somalia 
has also been invited to address the ICG.  Posts may wish to 
draw from the following points when informing host country 
and regional organization counterparts. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Begin Points. 
 
-- A broad consensus has been reached among ICG participants 
regarding the need to restructure the ICG to ensure its 
effectiveness as both an action-oriented group and as a 
coordination mechanism for the international community. 
 
-- The UN SRSG, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, is also comfortable 
with this approach and is prepared to take the lead of the 
ICG after its next high-level meeting. 
 
-- Norway will host the next high-level meeting in Oslo on 
April 30.  You should have received an invitation from Norway 
on or about April 15.  The agenda for this meeting will be 
focused on achieving concrete outcomes on key issues and 
challenges in Somalia. 
 
STATE 00041385  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
-- Following the transition to the SRSG as the lead of the 
ICG, the SRSG will have the discretion to include new 
participants in ICG discussions, as well as determine the 
composition and focus of any sub-groups under the ICG.  ICG 
efforts at the local level will be coordinated from Nairobi, 
or eventually from Somalia, with regular briefings to the ICG 
capitals. 
 
-- We appreciate the continued support of our ICG partners in 
achieving lasting peace and stability in Somalia, and look 
forward to working closely with all ICG participants to 
support a positive outcome through a restructured ICG. 
 
End Points.
