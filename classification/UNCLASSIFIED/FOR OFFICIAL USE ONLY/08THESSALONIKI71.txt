PLACES IN EFFORT TO "BUILD BRIDGES BETWEEN GREECE AND TURKEY" 
 
REF: 07 THESSALONIKI 019 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Greek MFA's Director for Thrace Affairs 
has switched positions with Greece's Consul General in Istanbul, 
in what both men describe as a small but sincere effort to 
improve Greek-Turkish relations.  Both intend to continue the 
work of the other, while bringing their different experiences 
and a fresh perspective to bear on longstanding challenges in 
the bilateral relationship.  While neither has illusions about 
their capacity to resolve  issues related to the Turkophone 
Muslim minority in Thrace or the Greek minority in Istanbul, 
both seem genuinely committed and well-qualified to make a 
difference.  Post strongly recommends Bornovas as a cooperative 
and knowledgeable interlocutor for ConGen Istanbul.  END SUMMARY 
 
NEW GREEK CG IN ISTANBUL IS EXPERT ON THRACE TURKISH MINORITY 
 
 ¶2.  (SBU) Vassilios BORNOVAS, the director of the MFA's office 
in Thrace from September 2003 until early September 2008, 
departed Greece in mid-September to become Consul General in 
Istanbul.  A career diplomat with the rank of Minister 
Counselor, Bornovas worked actively to improve education and 
living conditions for Thrace Muslims, including ethnic Turks and 
Roma.  He played a key role in the development of initiatives 
aimed at addressing Muslim minority demands, announced by 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Dora Bakoyannis in February 2007 
(ref).  Bornovas supported post public diplomacy efforts, 
generously provided advice and information, recommended new 
contacts and regularly consulted with us on a wide range of 
issues. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Bornovas is an expert on matters related to the 
Turkophone Muslim minority in Thrace.  He undertook a number of 
initiatives to improve education and living conditions for the 
Turkophone and Roma communities in Thrace.  His activism earned 
him admiration among local NGO's, academics and many Muslims, 
while other Muslims rejected his efforts as too little, too 
late.  Bornovas was proud that the Greek country chapter in the 
State Department's 2007 Human Rights Report referred to his 
efforts on behalf of the Roma, even though the references raised 
suspicions among some of his colleagues that he was too close to 
the Americans.  Bornovas said he hopes to build on the good 
relations his predecessor developed with Turkish authorities and 
business people.  In addition to working on long-standing 
bilateral issues related to the Greek Orthodox Church and Greek 
minority, Bornovas hopes to use his background to develop a 
constructive dialogue with Turks on the Turkish/Muslim minority 
in Thrace.  He also told us he plans to launch modest aid 
initiatives for underprivileged Turks in his consular district. 
 
 
¶4.  (U) Prior to being MFA Director in Thrace, Bornovas served 
at the Greek Embassy in Rome from 1999 to 2002 and before that 
at the OSCE (1998-1999).  Bornovas was also a Consul at the 
Greek Consulate General in Argyrokastro, Albania from 1992 - 
1996 and on the MFA Turkey desk (dealing with minority issues) 
from 1989-1992.  Mr. Bornovas holds a law degree from the 
Democritus University in Thrace. He speaks excellent French, 
Italian and English, and some Turkish.  He was born in Athens in 
¶1956. 
 
NEW MFA DIRECTOR FOR THRACE TO TACKLE TURKISH MINORITY ISSUES 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Bornovas replaced Alexandros Alexandris, who served as 
Consul General in Istanbul from 2003 until September 2008, and 
who has replaced Bornovas in Thrace as MFA Director.  In a 
meeting with us soon after arriving in Thrace, Alexandris told 
us he considered his new posting, coupled with Bornovas's 
posting to Istanbul, as a "mission to build bridges between 
Greece and Turkey."  He intends to continue Bornovas's activist 
approach, engaging moderate Turkophone Muslims and addressing 
social and economic issues.  He believes his fluent Turkish will 
be a significant asset.  He admits that he is still learning 
about Thrace minority issues, but says the key areas that need 
to be addressed are 1) the right to self-identification (e.g. as 
"Turkish" vs. "Muslim"), 2) the selection process for muftis 
(e.g. elections vs. government appointment), and 3) education 
(e.g. special schools for Turkish speaking students vs. 
mainstream schools that offer some instruction in Turkish). 
Alexandris served as Consul General in Toronto from 1999-2003, 
was in Athens from 1997-1999 and in Cyprus as an Embassy 
Counselor from 1991-1997. Dr. Alexandris holds a Ph.D. from 
King's College, London on "The Greeks of Turkey and 
Greek-Turkish Relations". 
 
¶6.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Bornovas and Alexandris both seem genuinely 
interested in making progress on longstanding bilateral problems 
with Turkey, though both are well aware of the limitations of 
their roles.  Post enjoyed excellent cooperation with Bornovas

and believes he could be a valuable contact for ConGen Istanbul 
on Greece/Turkey issues.  END COMMENT
