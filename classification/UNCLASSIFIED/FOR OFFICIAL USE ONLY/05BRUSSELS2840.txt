REF: A. (A) STATE 133146

¶1.  (SBU) On July 25 and 26, we delivered Reftel A points to 
Ana Ramirez, Principal Administrator for China and Southeast 
Asia at the European Council, and Henriette Geiger, China 
Desk Officer at the European Commission.  Both expressed 
appreciation for the report and talking points.  They pointed 
out that the EU has no independent way to track or confirm 
China's military modernization (other than anecdotal 
information gathered by EU officials visiting China, and the 
small EU delegation in Beijing). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Neither seemed alarmed by the 13% growth in 
military spending cited in the report, pointing to China's 
approximately 9% annual GDP growth in recent years; it is 
natural for a rapidly growing country to spend more on 
defense, they said.  However, they acknowledged concerns 
about China's relationship with Taiwan, saying even 
high-level Chinese officials have grown more "emotional" 
about the issue in recent months, and suggesting the EU and 
U.S. should cooperate to support low-profile negotiations 
between China and Taiwan.
