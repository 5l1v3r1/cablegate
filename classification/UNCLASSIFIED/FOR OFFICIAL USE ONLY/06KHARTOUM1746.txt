ISRAEL, LINK TO UN FORCE FOR DARFUR 
 
¶1. (U) Reuters has reported, and Embassy Pol/Econ FSNs have 
confirmed, that approximately 400 Sudanese staged a protest outside 
the Lebanese embassy on July 19, condemning the Israeli air strikes 
and calling on Arabs to fight the Jewish state in solidarity.  The 
protesters, many carrying pictures of Hamas Prime Minister Ismail 
Haniyeh and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, chanted slogans 
including "Destroy Israel" and "We are with you, the Palestinian and 
Lebanese people." 
 
¶2. (U) In addition, both Reuters and the Sudanese News Agency 
reported, again confirmed by Embassy FSNs, that approximately 350 
people attended a rally held at the same time by the Sudanese 
Workers Union at which speakers called for a pan-Arab jihad.  People 
packed stairwells and perched on window ledges for lack of space to 
hear union chief Ahmed Ghandour contrast the West's insistence on 
U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur with its reluctance to deploy a similar 
force to protect Palestinians.  "This is the international law we 
are living with.  Believe me, brothers and sisters, there is no 
international law except the law of power," Ghandour said. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post will continue to monitor local news and places of 
worship for information on potential unrest and/or planned 
demonstrations.
