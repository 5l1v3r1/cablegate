¶1. (SBU) In a March 26 meeting, we asked Alaa El Din Ibrahim 
and Abdallah Ali, Political and Media Secretaries of the 
Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) Abdulwahid Nur 
faction, respectively, to encourage Nur supporters in Darfur, 
and particularly in the internally displaced persons (IDP) 
camps, to refrain from violence in the upcoming Sudanese 
census per ref A demarche.  Ibrahim and Ali noted that the 
SLM/A Nur faction is opposed to the census, as it is a "tool" 
that the GOS will use to cement its control over Darfur. 
However, they said that SLM/A Nur has placed a moratorium on 
violence since the Darfur Peace Agreement negotiations in 
Abuja in 2006, in the hopes of fostering a better 
understanding between the rebel factions and international 
powers, particularly the U.S.  They were not planning to 
break this moratorium due to the census, they said. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On March 27 we delivered the same message to 
Siddique Ander and Osama Mohamed El Hassan, President and 
Secretary General, respectively, of the Democratic Popular 
 
SIPDIS 
Front (DPF).  They responded that, although the DPF supports 
the census in principle, in practice it will be flawed and 
lack transparency.  The DPF has learned to expect an attack 
any time the GOS enters areas held by the DPF, they said, and 
thus they could not rule out violent resistance to any GOS 
attempts to carry out the census in those areas.  However, 
the DPF and its supports might not resist if the census is 
carried out by an international third party, such as the UN, 
they continued. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ander and Hassan repeated their previous entreaties 
for the USG to recognize the DPF as an "important player" in 
Darfur (ref B).  Ander and Hassan boasted that the DPF is 
stronger even than the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) 
and "can easily control Khalil."  They requested contact 
between the Department in Washington and the DPF's 
representative in Philadelphia Mr. Jalal Adeela (phone 
numbers:  2-016-257-9785,  267939731).  When asked, they 
responded that Adeela had not attempted to contact the 
Department himself. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Note: We have so far been unable to contact JEM's 
Cairo representatives, but will continue to try to do so.
