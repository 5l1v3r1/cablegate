SUBJECT: DAMASCUS MEDIA REACTION - THE U.S.-IRAQI SECURITY AGREEMENT 
SPARKS A FEUD BETWEEN AN IRAQI AND SYRIAN OFFICIAL 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary and Comment:  Syrian media reported extensively on 
the argument between the Syrian and Iraqi Ministers of Information 
at the November 17 Conference for Arab Ministers of Information and 
Telecommunications in Damascus.  Media reports stated that Syrian 
Information Minister Bilal reiterated the SARG's concerns that the 
U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement allows the U.S. to usurp Iraq's 
sovereignty and threatens Syria.  Iraqi Telecommunications Minister 
Kader, who led the Iraqi delegation, stated that Syria must not 
interfere in Iraq's internal politics.  The press wrote that the 
Secretary General of the Arab League intervened to quell the 
dispute.  This argument is the latest public dispute between Syria 
and Iraq regarding matters of regional security.  Syria has launched 
a media campaign to paint the Iraqi government as succumbing to U.S. 
demands.  End Summary and Comment.

Feud on the Floor

¶2. (SBU) Al-Watan, a private Syrian newspaper with daily circulation 
of 25,000, reported on the argument between the Syrian and Iraqi 
ministers at the November 17 Conference of Arab Ministers of 
Information and Telecommunications.  Syria's Information Minister 
Bilal said the U.S. is "trying to impose its conditions on Iraqis 
and to legalize the arbitrary and usurping presence of their 
[forces] on Iraqi territory with this accord." 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Syrian Minister continued by stating the agreement 
"rewards the American occupier and gives it rights at the expense of 
the Iraqi people and their neighbors... The people in Iraq cannot 
accept anything which damages their history, independence, dignity, 
or anything that damages neighboring countries."  Al-Watan noted 
that the Iraqi Telecommunications Minister responded angrily, 
accusing Syria of "interfering in Iraqi internal affairs" and 
declaring that Iraqis would "not stand for such interference."

The Arab League Secretary General Plays Peacekeeper

¶4. (SBU) All4Syria, a popular moderately independent website, and 
Al-Watan newspaper reported that Arab League Secretary General Amr 
Moussa had to intervene to calm down the two Ministers.   The Iraqi 
minister told media outlets that the Secretary General eased the 
dispute between them over a "cup of coffee." 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  This argument on the conference floor is the 
latest in an ongoing public spat between Syrian and Iraqi officials. 
 The SARG has launched an active media campaign using television, 
radio, and print media to discredit the U.S.-Iraqi Security Pact. 
FM Mouallem echoed this theme in his joint press conference with 
visiting Iraqi FM Zebari last week.  We will watch SARG rhetoric 
carefully during the upcoming November 22-23 Border Security Working 
Group to see if there is any softening of Syria's public line.  End 
Comment.
