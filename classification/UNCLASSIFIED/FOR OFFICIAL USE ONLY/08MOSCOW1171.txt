Â¶1. (SBU) In separate meetings April 23, we discussed the nuclear 
fuel fabrication transaction between Exelon Corporation and TVEL of 
Russia with Senior Counselor Aleksey Karpov and Second Secretary 
Aleksandr Trofimov from the MFA's Department for Security and 
Disarmament Affairs, and with Konstantin Popov, Acting Director of 
the International Department at Rosatom.  Karpov, Trofimov and Popov 
agreed that preliminarily this appeared to be a routine civilian 
nuclear commercial transaction.  Popov said that Rosatom would work 
on preparing the requested GOR assurances for the transaction.
