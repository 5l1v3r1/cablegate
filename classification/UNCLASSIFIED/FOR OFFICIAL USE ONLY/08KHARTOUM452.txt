CHAD-SUDAN CONFLICT 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  The Darfur rebel Justice and Equality 
Movement's (JEM) Chief Negotiator, Ahmed Tougod, told emboff by 
satellite phone on March 26 that JEM rejects the upcoming census, 
the AU-UN's approach to the peace process, and bilateral 
negotiations with the Government of Sudan (GoS).  Tougod, claiming 
to be near Jebel Moon in West Darfur, stated the Chadian-supported 
JEM has regrouped and is now "stronger than ever" following 
government attacks on JEM positions in West Darfur.  Tougod also 
dismissed the Sudan-Chad agreement signed in Dakar on March 13, 
stating that for the last two weeks his field commanders have 
witnessed increased GoS support for Chadian opposition movements. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
PEACE PROCESS 
- - - - - - - 
¶2.  (SBU)  JEM Chief Negotiator Tougod stated that although he is in 
regular contact with representatives from UNAMID's Joint Mediation 
Support Team (JMST), he has little faith in their work.  "We feel 
that the JMST support team is not united, has little cohesion, no 
momentum, and will not be able to make a breakthrough," stated 
Tougod.  Tougod further criticized the JMST, stating that it is 
disconnected from the "reality on the ground."  Tougod admitted that 
people view JEM's willingness to negotiate with the government as a 
sign of desperation or weakness; however, he stated that this 
willingness was due to weakness of the JMST, not JEM.  He said that 
Presidential Advisor Nafie Ali-Nafie's rejection of JEM's initiative 
has completely shut down all channels of communication between the 
GoS and JEM.  "We only communicate through the media," stated 
Tougod. 
 
"JEM IS STRONGER THAN EVER" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶3.  (SBU) Tougod stated that there is no other strong or capable 
movement like JEM and reiterated the JEM claim that the government's 
"massacre" in Abu Sirouj, Sileah, and Sirba has helped JEM's 
recruitment efforts.  "After the government's operation, we have 
re-organized, and are now in a stronger military position," said 
Tougod. This seems to imply that reports of Chadian resupply of JEM 
are not far off the mark. 
 
REJECTION OF THE CENSUS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶4.  (SBU)  According to Tougod, it is "not appropriate" to conduct a 
census when Sudanese refugees have fled to Chad and thousands of 
Darfuri IDPs are located all over Sudan.  He stated that JEM's 
official position is to boycott the census as "it will only 
undermine the future of Darfur, bring biased results, and will not 
at all help our people."  Emboff stated that the United States 
disagrees with JEM's position, adding that the census and the 
election (though not directly linked) are both important to Sudan's 
transformation into a fully democratic state.  Emboff urged JEM to 
encourage its adherents to support and participate in the census. 
 
JEM ON CHADIAN OPPOSITION 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶5.  (SBU)  Tougod said he has actually seen an increase in GoS troop 
and Chadian opposition movements since President Deby and Bashir 
signed a peace agreement in Dakar on March 13.  He confirmed that 
Timane Erdimi, head of the Rally of Forces for Change (RFC), will 
soon join the Chadian Government and that this "will remove the 
Zaghawa opposition element of the Chadian rebels."  He stated that 
other rebels, such as former Chadian Defense Minister Mahamat Nouri 
of the United Force for Democracy and Development, have continued to 
work with the Government of Sudan in overthrowing the Chadian 
government. 
 
"WE WANT CONTACT WITH THE U.S." 
- -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶6.  (SBU) Tougod reiterated previous JEM calls for a meeting with 
senior U.S. officials, including Assistant Secretary of State for 
African Affairs, Jendayi Frazer, and the U.S. Special Envoy to 
Sudan, Richard Williamson.  Emboff stated that a high-level visit 
with these figures is very unlikely at this time, but that he would 
convey the message to Washington. 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - 
¶7.  (SBU)  Tougod appeared annoyed that emboff both disagreed with 
JEM's position on the census and expressed doubt that senior U.S. 
policy makers would now entertain a JEM visit.   This irritation 
only further affirms the weight that JEM attaches to U.S. approval 
for its actions, especially as it jockeys for position among many 
rebel groups and holds grandiose dreams of one day ruling Sudan. 
More importantly, it also signals that while JEM is likely to 
continue provocative attacks in Darfur (that will lead to brutal SAF 
responses falling chiefly on innocent civilians), the movement is 
 
KHARTOUM 00000452  002 OF 002 
 
 
receptive to further U.S. suggestions, should the U.S. seek to exert 
more influence over the destructive actions of rebel movements such 
as JEM.  We will continue to urge participation in census and 
elections, and will also push JEM toward negotiations and 
participation in JMST events (assuming JMST ever gets its act 
together, which is a big assumption).
