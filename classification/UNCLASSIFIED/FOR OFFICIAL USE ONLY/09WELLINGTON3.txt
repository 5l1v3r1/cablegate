SUBJECT: NZ RESPONSE TO ACTION REQUEST CONCERNING THE 
INTERNATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY AGENCY (IRENA) 
 
REF: SECSTATE 134385 
 
 Â¶1. (SBU) In response to reftel action request. Poloff 
contacted Richard Hawke, Manager of the Energy and 
Environment Office for the New Zealand Ministry of Economic 
Development.  Hawke stated that the GNZ is aware of IRENA, 
that there have been internal GNZ discussions concerning the 
proposal, and that the GNZ has decided to not take a position 
on the initiative at this time.  Hawke acknowledged that 
several governments, including the USG, oppose IRENA for the 
reasons of duplication and overlap with existing renewable 
energy programs.  He explained that the GNZ has not yet seen 
a valid case to support the program, and that the GNZ is 
constrained by limited resources and previous commitments 
(for example, the Energy Development for Island Nations 
initiative sponsored by the GNZ, USG and the government of 
Iceland).  Nevertheless, according to Hawke, NZ "is not 
saying no, and is not closing the door."
