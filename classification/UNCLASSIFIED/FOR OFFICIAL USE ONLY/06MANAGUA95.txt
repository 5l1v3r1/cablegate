Avil Ramirez to discuss points in reftel.  The Minister

problems with the proposed language in the diplomatic note. 
He also noted that Nicaraguan Ministry and Army officials had 
recently visited the United Nations to discuss participation 
in peace keeping missions outside of the scope of GPOI.  Post
