SUBJECT: FRANCE WILL BEGIN RATIFICATION PROCESS FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF ACTS OF 
NUCLEAR TERRORISM 
 
REF: STATE 102149 
 
¶1. (SBU) French MFA counterterrorism official, Francois 
Revardeaux, told poloff at the end of July that the MFA will 
begin working in September 2007 on ratification of the UN 
International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of 
Nuclear Terrorism.  The Convention's ratification, Revardeaux 
said, required passage of new legislation by the National 
Assembly.  Now that election season was over in France, the 
MFA would begin to push the full ratification process 
following August holidays.  Revardeaux did not anticipate any 
significant impediments to the Convention's ratification. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Revardeaux agreed that it was important for other 
countries to sign and ratify the Convention and expressed the 
hope that France and the U.S. would soon be leading by 
example.  As an active member of the 1373 Committee, he said, 
France would continue to push for the international adoption 
of all UN Conventions related to terrorism.
