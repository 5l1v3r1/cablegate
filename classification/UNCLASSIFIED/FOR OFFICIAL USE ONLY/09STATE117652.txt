SUBJECT: ENGAGING THE GOI ON PROCEDURES AT WEST BANK 
CROSSINGS 
 
REF: JERUSALEM 1966 
 
¶1.  (U) This message includes an action request for Embassy 
Tel Aviv in para 3. 
 
 ¶2.  Per reftel, the crossing procedures currently employed 
by the GOI,s Crossing Points Authority at the Jalameh 
crossing between Israel and the West Bank are inconsistent 
with prior practice at Jalameh and current practice at other 
check-points between Israel and the West Bank and within the 
West Bank. The lack of clear and consistent procedures pose a 
potential security concern for USG personnel, and need to be 
clarified.  Although this is not an issue of legal obligation 
under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, it has 
been GOI past practice to treat consulate vehicles as having 
diplomatic protection. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Action Request for Embassy Tel Aviv: Post is 
requested to approach the GOI at appropriate level to ask 
that the GOI clarify the procedures employed at West Bank 
crossings and check-points.  Post should accomplish the 
following objectives: 
 
-- Request clarification from the GOI on the security 
procedures employed at West Bank crossings and check-points. 
 
-- Obtain GOI commitment to employ uniform procedures at all 
crossings and check-points. 
 
-- Express concern that disparate and unpredictable security 
procedures may impact the safety and security of USG 
personnel.  Request that crossing procedures do not 
jeopardize the ability for USG personnel to travel to the 
West Bank.
