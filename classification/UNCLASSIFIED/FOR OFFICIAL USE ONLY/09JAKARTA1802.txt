Sensitive But Unclassified -- Please handle accordingly. 
 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) This cable provides Embassy Jakarta's concurrence 
with the regional Section 1206 counterterrorism support 
proposals and prioritization summarized in reftel.  The 
Indonesia-specific proposals described below were developed 
with host government officials in the context of regional 
coordination of counterterrorist efforts.  The proposals 
focus on increasing Indonesia's national helicopter and 
maritime interdiction capabilities, particularly in response 
to the ongoing threat of terrorist activities by Jemaah 
Islamiya and related entities. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Following are brief descriptions of Jakarta's 
proposed projects, as endorsed by the Mission.  Additional 
information is available upon request. 
 
-- Helicopter Interdiction Capability (CT), $7.6 million. 
 
This Section 1206-funded equipment and training will provide 
a night vision capability and enhanced communications that 
will give Indonesian Army aviators a day/night capability to 
insert Indonesia,s counterterrorism forces throughout the 
archipelago for direct action to counter terrorist attacks or 
to interdict suspected terrorist cells or other transnational 
threats based on intelligence. Night Vision Devices 
(NODs/NVDs) will provide night insertion capabilities. 
Front-light infra-red cameras will increase situational 
awareness and crew and pilot safety.  Communications upgrade 
will increase and air-ground interoperability. 
 
-- Naval Maritime Interdiction Capability (CT), $12.5 
million. 
 
This proposal helps provide Indonesia with a more robust 
maritime interdiction and vessel board search and seizure 
(VBSS) capability for improved maritime border control, 
counterterrorism, riverine, and search and rescue operations. 
 It includes 100 sets of initial individual equipment to 
train and equip a NAVSOF force to perform over the beach, 
land warfare, and littoral or open ocean direct action. 
Specific missions will include VBSS (Surface and Heliborne), 
GOPLAT, and raids and ambushes in the jungle and riverine 
environment.  A mobile capability consisting of 6 Rigid Hull 
Inflatable Boats (RHIB) will be provided to NAVSOF unit with 
sufficient pool assets to ensure maintenance.  Onboard 
weapons for each boat consist of .50 Cal machinegun forward 
and 7.62MM mounted machinegun aft.  In addition, Zodiac 
Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC) would allow for 
clandestine NAVSOF interdiction in the littoral. This 
proposal will also provide Indonesia with an increased 
capacity to partner with neighboring countries in cooperative 
maritime security operations. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mission affirms that it is not aware of any credible 
evidence of gross violations of human rights by any units 
which would receive assistance under the 1206 project 
proposals listed above.  Embassy Jakarta also acknowledges 
the requirement to undertake Leahy vetting for all units, if 
the projects are funded, per normal foreign assistance 
procedures.
