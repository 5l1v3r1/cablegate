SUBJECT: UNSC: COUNCIL CONSULTATIONS ON UNDOF (GOLAN 
HEIGHTS) MANDATE EXTENSION 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: In Security Council consultations on 
December 10, the Secretariat briefed on the activities of the 
UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), which supervises the 
cease-fire between Israel and Syria in the Golan Heights.  He 
referred to the Secretary-General's November 26 report to the 
Council which describes the last six-month period as 
"generally quiet."  He said the Secretary-General considers 
UNDOF's continued presence essential and Israel and Syria 
both agree to the extension of the force's mandate for a 
further six-months.  All thirteen Council members who spoke 
agreed to the extension.  The Council is scheduled to adopt 
the mandate extension resolution on December 19.  Ambassador 
Wolff proposed moving to an annual mandate renewal in June 
2009, given the Council's widespread agreement on the need 
for the force, the fact that three of the six troop 
contributors will be on the next Council, and in line with 
the force's annual GA financing.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In consultations on December 10, DPKO Asia & Middle 
East Division Director Wolfgang Weisbrod-Weber briefed the 
Council on the activities of the UN Disengagement Observer 
Force (UNDOF), which supervises the cease-fire between Israel 
and Syria in the Golan Heights, as required by UNSCR 1821 
(June 27, 2008).  Weisbrod-Weber noted that the 
Secretary-General's November 26 report (e-mailed to IO/UNP) 
on the 1,039-member force describes the last six-month period 
as "generally quiet."  He said that both sides had denied 
UNDOF inspection teams access to some of their positions and 
imposed restrictions on UNDOF's freedom of movement.  He also 
described how UNDOF had adapted its "operational posture" to 
both the IDF's increased training activities and the Syrian 
civilian settlement growth near the cease-fire line in the 
area of separation, but stressed that neither of these 
constituted violations.  He said that UNDOF had some 
difficulty moving supplies but hoped both sides would make 
more of an effort on this issue.  He noted the hazard that 
old mines, given the 34-year cease-fire, pose to UNDOF 
personnel. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Weisbrod-Weber said that the Secretary-General 
considers UNDOF's continued presence in the area essential, 
and both Syria and Israel agree to the extension of UNDOF's 
mandate for a further six months.  At the end of the meeting, 
the Secretariat circulated the draft mandate extension 
resolution and draft Presidential Statement (PRST) for the 
Council's consideration.  Formal adoption of the UNDOF 
mandate extension resolution is scheduled for December 19. 
(Comment: Both the draft resolution and PRST appear identical 
to the versions approved June 27, 2008, and have been 
e-mailed to IO/UNP.  End comment.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) All thirteen Council members, including the U.S., 
who spoke during consultations voiced support for the 
extension of UNDOF's mandate and many encouraged the parties 
to resume their indirect talks.  (Note: Only Panama and Costa 
Rica did not speak.  End note.)  The Libyan Perm Rep welcomed 
UNDOF's efforts to date but said Libya was displeased with 
the ongoing occupation of the Golan and hoped a comprehensive 
solution would be found.  Ambassador Wolff cited the 
widespread agreement in favor of the extension; the fact that 
the 2009 Council will include three of the six UNDOF troop 
contributors (Austria, Croatia, and Japan); and suggested 
that the Council consider in June an annual mandate extension 
for UNDOF, in line with its July to June financial 
appropriation, vice a six-month mandate.  After 
consultations, Weisbrod-Weber told PolOff that DPKO would 
support such a change.  He noted that when such a change had 
been previously attempted, Syria had resisted, preferring the 
semi-annual mandate renewal process to remind the Council of 
the issue.  (Comment: Given the Council's monthly meetings on 
the Middle East which can include the Golan and references to 
Israeli-Syrian indirect talks, the Council discusses the 
Golan more than semi-annually. End comment.)
