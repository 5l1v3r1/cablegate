DISCUSSION 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche on 11/4 to Cho 
Tae-ick, Director of MOFAT's Human Rights and Social Affairs 
Division, urging the ROK to vote against any resolution on 
the Goldstone Report that included counterproductive 
elements.  Director Cho thanked us for the update on the USG 
position and said the ROK was similarly concerned that, 
broadly speaking, the UNGA discussion would "not be helpful" 
in getting the Peace Process back on track.  Cho, who had 
just come from a meeting about the Goldstone Report, 
emphasized the ROK would again look to follow the EU's lead; 
it was unlikely, he acknowledged, that the EU would reach 
consensus about how to proceed.  Cho pledged to relay our 
points immediately to the ROK UN Mission in New York.
