¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On May 14, Ambassador delivered ref A 
demarche to Minister of Foreign Affairs Tsekoa regarding UN and 
SADC engagement on the crisis in Zimbabwe.  Tsekoa expressed 
particular appreciation for recognition of SADC's leadership 
role in seeking a peaceful resolution to the electoral process, 
adding that the GOL had conducted a substantive dialogue the 
previous day with visiting Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan 
Tsvangirai (ref B).  Regarding the latter's May 13 afternoon 
visit to Lesotho, a GOL press release said that Deputy Prime 
Minister Lehohla had discussed Tsvangirai's concerns about 
escalating violence, SADC involvement in the anticipated 
presidential run-off elections, and a potential forthcoming SADC 
extraordinary heads of state and government summit.  Speaking to 
a local journalist, Tshangarai said that his MDC party will 
enter the run-off, but SADC must create an enabling environment 
that will give security and confidence to Zimbabweans.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On May 14, Ambassador and DCM delivered ref A talking 
points to Minister of Foreign Affairs Tsekoa regarding UN and 
SADC engagement on the crisis in Zimbabwe.   Minister Tsekoa 
expressed appreciation for the demarche, in particular USG 
recognition of SADC's leadership role in seeking a peaceful 
resolution to the electoral process, and said he would relay the 
points directly to Deputy Prime Minister Lehohla at a follow-on 
meeting.   Tsekoa noted that in order to help facilitate the 
process, the GOL had agreed to meet the previous afternoon with 
visiting Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai for a 
substantive discussion (ref B).  Although the Foreign Minister 
did not offer further details on the discussions, he added that 
Tsvangirai "had asked for 30 minutes to brief us, but we engaged 
him for nearly two hours." 
 
¶3. (U) Further to the May 13 Tsvangirai visit,  a May 14 GOL 
press release stated that the Zimbabwean's meeting with the 
Deputy Prime Minister had addressed the following issues: 
 
-- The Movement for Democratic Charge's (MDC) concerns about 
escalating acts of violence and intimidation against the 
Zimbabwean citizens, in particular supporters of the opposition 
MDC; 
-- A request from the MDC for support from the GOL, as a member 
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), in 
ensuring peaceful and fair conduct of the forthcoming 
presidential run-off elections in Zimbabwe; 
-- An MDC appeal to SADC member states to convene an 
extraordinary SADC summit of heads of state and government to 
discuss the date of the envisaged run-off presidential election, 
minimum conditions for the run-off presidential election, and 
mechanisms for the transfer of power to the winning party. 
 
¶4. (U) Speaking to a journalist from the state-owned Lesotho 
News Agency (LENA) following the May 13 meeting, Tshangarai said 
his MDC party will enter the run-off, but SADC must create an 
enabling environment that will give security and confidence to 
Zimbabweans.  "We believe that we have a two-pronged approach to 
the crisis in Zimbabwe, which is either a dialogue or a run-off. 
 Because everyone in the region has chosen a route to going 
towards the run-off, we are prepared for it," he added.  The MDC 
leader further said there have been attempts to convince ZANU-PF 
that it is necessary or desirable to negotiate a settlement 
rather hold a run-off, but ZANU-PF seems unready "to accept the 
will of the people." 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  According to Embassy sources, the GOL 
delegation agreed to attend the proposed new SADC extraordinary 
summit if it is convened by the current SADC chair and to 
support decisions reached collectively.  While only a few 
details concerning Tshangarai's May 13 meeting with top GOL 
officials are now emerging, we will continue to observe 
Lesotho's position on Zimbabwe to gauge any deviation from its 
current position to remain in step with noninterventionist SADC 
neighbors.  END COMMENT.
