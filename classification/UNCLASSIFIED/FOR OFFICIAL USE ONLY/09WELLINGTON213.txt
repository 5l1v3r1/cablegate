¶1. (SBU)  Summary.  New Zealanders are becoming increasingly 
concerned over H1N1 Influenza A (swine flu) as the virus spreads 
throughout the general population, causing serious illness and 
several deaths since the end of June.  The public health sector has 
reported increased activity related to H1N1 as the NZ public 
becomes more concerned about the virus' effect.  The Government of 
New Zealand (GNZ) has also publicized work being done on two 
different vaccines to protect public health workers and the general 
population.  The Cook Islands reported their first confirmed case 
of H1N1 flu in their jurisdiction, but are facing challenges in 
timely evaluation for other potential cases.  Post feels that GNZ 
has dealt with H1N1 in a manner that makes best use of NZ's 
resources.  End summary. 
 
 
 
Public Fears Rise  in New Zealand as First H1N1 Deaths Reported 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------------- 
------------------ 
 
 
 
¶2. (U)  The mood of the New Zealand public has shifted since the 
first deaths associated with H1N1 Influenza A were reported by the 
Ministry of Health (MoH) and the media on weekend of July 4-5.  By 
in large, New Zealanders have been cautious about flu risks and 
cooperative with New Zealand health authorities since April when 
H1N1 flu was recognized as a health threat.  However, the three 
reported deaths over the July 4-5 weekend and additional four 
deaths the following week, rapid growth in confirmed infection 
cases (now totaling over 1000 cases), and the impact of regular 
seasonal flu have all raised the level of concern in the public. 
The Government has made repeated statements acknowledging the 
deaths and concerns of the public, but for the most part has noted 
that cases of serious illness and death were regrettably expected 
from at-risk populations as the virus spreads through the country. 
 
 
 
¶3. (U)  The MoH and general health practitioners have reported an 
increase in calls to help-lines and in office consultations since 
the week of June 29, and local press have reported on a near-daily 
basis on H1N1 stories across the country.  There is also growing 
concern in the public from media and MoH reports that some severe 
cases are being exhibited in patients with no pre-existing health 
problems. 
 
 
 
GNZ has Two-Pronged Vaccine Plan 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
 
 
¶4. (U)  MoH has reported on two separate orders for an H1N1 vaccine 
over the week of July 6, with an initial order for 300,000 doses 
from U.S. provider Baxter for up to 150,000 front-line health care 
workers (two doses per worker) to be available as early as August. 
The Government has emphatically stated that the vaccine was only 
for health care workers, and that politicians and public servants 
would not be eligible for the initial doses.  The general 
population will be offered treatment from a second 8 million dose 
vaccine order from Australian provider CSL, but that order will not 
be ready until the end of the year.  MoH Deputy Director for Public 
Health Fran McGrath noted that the Baxter order was requested when 
it became clear that the CSL vaccine would not be available soon

enough to provide protection to the public health system which is 
already starting to see problems crop up with staff illness in some 
districts.  MoH is also starting to offer free seasonal flu shots 
to all NZ citizens in an effort to reduce strain at clinics and 
hospitals. 
 
 
 
Cook Islands See First H1N1 Case 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
 
¶5. (U)   Cook Islands (CI) authorities have reported the first 
confirmed H1N1 case in their jurisdiction over the 4th of July 
weekend.  The case was a 14-year old boy who had recently returned 
from New Zealand.  CI authorities appear to be implementing a 
containment policy similar to NZ's earlier this year, but may be 
experiencing difficulties in getting timely testing as all samples 
must be returned to NZ, which houses the closest WHO-certified lab. 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Comment.  It is likely that the NZ MoH's containment 
plan, in place since April, has contributed greatly to the delay of 
widespread H1N1 infection across the country until now, even though 
NZ was one of the first countries to report infection.  Post judges 
the GNZ approach to the virus, to date, to be proficient given the 
resources at its disposal.  Health Minister Tony Ryall has 
deservedly received plaudits for his management of the outbreak and 
prospects are good for a continuation of the GNZ's effective H1N1 
strategy.  End Comment.
