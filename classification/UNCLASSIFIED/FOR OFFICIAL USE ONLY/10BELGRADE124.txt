¶1.  (SBU) Post conveyed Ref A points to Foreign Affairs Ministry 
North America Desk Officer Srdjan Miljkovic on January 25. 
Miljkovic replied that he would pass the information to his 
colleagues at the MFA Department of Multilateral Economic 
Cooperation, who were responsible for Serbian assistance to Haiti. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Serbian government formally decided on January 21 to 
donate $100,000 to Haiti relief efforts via the Serbian Red Cross 
(rather than through the UN as originally reported Ref B).  On 
January 22, the City of Belgrade announced it would donate five 
million dinars ($73,000), also through the Serbian Red Cross.
