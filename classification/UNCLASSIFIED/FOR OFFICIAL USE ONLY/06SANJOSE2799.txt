REF: STATE 199860 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolOff discussed reftel points with the Foreign 
Ministry's Director for Multilateral Affairs, Carlos Cordero, 
on December 18.  Cordero claimed to be unaware of any G-77 
position or proposals for increasing the dues ceiling from 22 
to 25 percent.  Cordero stated that Costa Rica would prefer 
the status quo over a proposal being floated by Japan.  On 
December 19, Deputy Director for Foreign Policy Edwin Arias 
declined to comment on the scale of assessments issue saying 
that instructions had not been issued since the Ministry was 
still consulting internally.  On December 20, PolCouns passed 
reftel points to MFA Director for Foreign Policy Jose Joaquin 
Chaverri and to FM Stagno's Chief of Staff Antonio Alarcon. 
Chaverri reiterated that the MFA was still "studying" the 
issue. 
 
¶2. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Post would appreciate information on 
the Japanese proposal referred to by Cordero.  Please advise.
