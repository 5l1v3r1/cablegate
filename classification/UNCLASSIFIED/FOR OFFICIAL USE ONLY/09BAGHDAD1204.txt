¶1. (SBU) Summary: Through a series of meetings over a 
week-long visit, senior GOI officials told a visiting USG 
delegation from NEA/I and STAS that the GOI lacks a coherent 
Science and Technology (S-T) policy development and funding 
mechanism, and identified three similar but competing options 
that various GOI stakeholders are presently pursuing.  Since 
GOI S-T spending is small and unlikely to change dramatically 
in the short-term, funds, rather than funding mechanisms, 
will likely remain the bottle neck in S-T policy development 
and spending.  The Embassy will continue to use the Strategic 
Framework Agreement Science and Technology Working Group to 
encourage and inform GOI S-T policy development.  End Summary. 
 
Three Options for Future S-T Development 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) From March 7-12, EmbOffs and representatives of the 
Iraq Desk (NEA/I) and the Secretary's Science and Technology 
Adviser's Office (STAS) met with about thirty key GOI and 
Iraqi university officials.  The USG representatives wished 
to understand how the GOI intends to develop S-T policy and 
fund S-T research.  These meetings were in response to the 
report of the S-T roundtable convened by the Department in 
Washington, DC, on November 20, 2008 (reftel).  GOI 
participants in the meetings identified three competing 
options for S-T policy development and research funding. 
 
First Option: Scientific Research Commission 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research 
(HESR) Dr. Abd al-Ujayli announced the formation of the 
Scientific Research Commission (SRC) in September 2008 (the 
SRC was then called the Scientific Research Authority or 
SRA).  The SRC is currently part of the HESR Ministry, but 
has minimal staffing and funding.  The Minister of HESR said 
the SRC, with maturity, could serve within about 5 years as a 
national S-T research-funding entity, and the Ministry or the 
SRC could develop national S-T policy.  He did not say 
whether he prefers the SRC to remain within the Ministry or 
to be an independent entity.  Chair of the Council of 
Representatives (CoR) Education Committee Dr. Alaa Makki 
supports an independent SRC but said establishing an 
independent SRC is not politically feasible at this time.  In 
time, however, an SRC within the Ministry of HESR could be 
the precursor for an independent SRC that funds S-T research. 
 (Note: S-T policy development and research funding are 
within the purview of Dr. Makki's CoR committee.  End note.) 
 
Second Option: National Academy of Sciences 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Iraq currently has two national academies of sciences: 
the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), founded in 1947 but 
tainted by political appointments, and the Iraq National 
Academy of Sciences (Iraq NAS), founded in November 2003 and 
composed of prominent Iraqi scientists, some of whom are 
expatriates.  Neither of these academies is currently 
functioning effectively.  Dr. Husayn al-Shahristani, the 
Minister of Oil and President and founding member of the Iraq 
NAS, told EmbOffs that he has recommended to the Prime 
Minister that the two academies be merged, a recommendation 
he says the Prime Minister supports.  Dr. Shahristani said 
this merged NAS should develop national S-T policy and could 
serve as a national S-T research-funding entity or, at least, 
could recommend research projects to be funded.  He admitted 
Qcould recommend research projects to be funded.  He admitted 
the creation now of a new independent S-T research-funding 
entity would be politically difficult. 
 
Third Option: Two Independent Entities 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Minister of Science and Technology Raid Fahmi said the 
GOI should have an independent entity to lead national S-T 
policy development and to coordinate S-T policy 
implementation and budgeting across the GOI.  He also said 
the GOI should have another independent entity to fund 
national S-T research across the GOI, an entity similar in 
purpose and design to the Iraq Nonproliferation Programs 
Foundation.  CoR Education Committee Chair Dr. Makki and the 
Chair of the Education Committee of the Board of Advisors to 
the Prime Minister (PM), Dr. Saad Ibrahim, support this 
option.

¶6. (SBU) GOI S-T spending is small and unlikely to change 
dramatically in the short-term given current budget 
constraints.  This is likely one of the main reasons science 
policy and funding mechanisms have not received more 
political attention.  While each GOI official noted Iraq 
lacks a coherent S-T policy, it was notable that each 
official also admitted they have been actively working 
political back-channels to advance their preferred funding 
solution.  Noting that the three funding options discussed 
above have many similar characteristics, the GOI should not 
have significant difficulty finding an acceptable solution. 
Thus, funds, rather than funding mechanisms, will likely 
remain the bottle neck in S-T policy development and 
spending.  The Embassy will continue to use the Strategic 
Framework Agreement Science and Technology Working Group to 
inform and influence GOI S-T policy development.
