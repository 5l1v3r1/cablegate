SUBJECT: AMERICAN-TURKISH ASSOCIATION STAFFDEL FOCUSES ON 
IRAQ, PKK, ARMENIAN GENOCIDE RESOLUTION 
 
 
1.(SBU) Summary:  American-Turkish Council (ATC) staff 
members focused on Iraq, the terrorist PKK organization, and 
a potential Armenian genocide resolution (AGR) during August 
7-8 meetings in Turkey with MFA and Turkish business 
officials.  MFA U/S Apakan told the group that a U.S. 
withdrawal would exacerbate problems in Iraq, and that the 
GOT needs concrete USG actions to counter the terrorist 
Kurdistan Workers, Party (PKK) there.  Apakan also explained 
that passage of an AGR would complicate US-Turkish relations. 
 In Istanbul, the American Business Forum Turkey (ABFT) 
described how continuing PKK attacks and possible passage of 
an AGR could undermine U.S. companies, interest in Turkey. 
Staff members acknowledged the potential adverse effect of an 
AGR, and suggested the GOT and ABFT step up efforts to 
educate Congressional staff in Washington during the summer 
recess.  End summary. 
 
2.(SBU) MFA U/S Apakan told five Republican Senate staff 
members on August 7 that a U.S. failure in Iraq would be a 
failure for all.  A precipitous American troop pullout would 
destabilize the region and have severe negative repercussions 
in Turkey.  According to Apakan, sectarian divisions would 
prolong violence, and it would take ten years to stabilize 
Iraq.  UN support would help, but stability and progress 
ultimately would depend on continued USG presence and 
increased dialogue between the USG and Iraq's neighbors. 
 
3.(SBU) Apakan reiterated GOT policy that Turkey has a right 
to defend itself from terrorism by undertaking a cross-border 
military operation (CBO) against the PKK in Northern Iraq. 
He stressed that Turkey must see more cooperation from the 
U.S. soon to alleviate the necessity of a CBO. 
 
4.(SBU) Turning to the AGR, Apakan emphasized that passage of 
an AGR would severely strain US-Turkish  relations.  The 
Turkish public would be outraged, making cooperation with the 
USG difficult.  Apakan stressed that Turkey has opened its 
historical archives so that any scholar may study the issue, 
and has asked Armenia to do the same.  The GOT has offered to 
convene a joint historical commission with Armenia to study 
the issues, and Turkey has agreed to accept the conclusions 
of such a body, he said. 
 
5.(SBU)  At a separate August 9 meeting in Istanbul with the 
American Business Forum Turkey (ABFT), ABFT board members 
described a steady improvement in Turkey's business climate 
over the past several years and were optimistic that recent 
election results would result in continued pro-business 
policies.  They noted that U.S. policy regarding PKK 
operations in northern Iraq and the potential passage of an 
AGR could adversely affect U.S. companies doing business in 
Turkey.   The perception that the U.S. is "doing nothing" to 
stop the PKK from using northern Iraq as a base to attack 
Turkey was widespread, ABFT Vice Chairman Jeff Kemprecos 
explained, and the ill-will created by this perception could 
easily spread to U.S. companies.  The lack of "kinetic 
action" by the U.S. military is particularly difficult to 
explain, commented one defense sector representative. 
 
6.(SBU) Chairman of the Board Galip Sukaya stressed that 
passage of an AGR would definitely hurt U.S. companies 
operating in Turkey.  Board members representing the consumer 
products and food and beverage industries told Staffdel 
members that the effect of an AGR would also be felt by U.S. 
companies throughout the region, particularly in Azerbaijan. 
A representative from the defense sector noted that French 
defense firms had been effectively black-listed from all 
military equipment tenders following passage of a related 
piece of legislation by the lower house of the French 
parliament. 
 
7.(SBU) Staffdel members encouraged ABFT to work closely with 
business headquarters in the United States, as well as 
industry groups, to convey their concerns on AGR directly to 
House staff before the end of August.  They also encouraged 
MFA officials to meet with House staffers to explain the GOT 
position during this summer's recess.
