REF: 06 KABUL 5879 
 
¶1.  (U) Dr Mohammed Alam Ishaqzai, who until recently 
served as Nangarhar Deputy Governor and Director of 
Finance, has been selected as the new Governor for 
Baghlan Province.  Governor Gul Agha Sherzai of 
Nangarhar confirmed Ishaqzai's appointment to PRT 
officials at a meeting at Jalalabad Airfield on Jan 
¶25. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  PC Chairman Muslimyar had 
reported to the PRT last November that Dr. 
Ishaq Zai was a leading candidate for the 
position of Deputy in the Ministry of 
Interior in Kabul  (Reftel).  The news of 
his appointment as governor of Baghlan 
Province came as a surprise to PRT 
officials, and will leave both the Deputy 
Governor and Director of Finance positions 
in Nangarhar open, as Dr. Ishaq Zai held 
both positions. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Comment:  Ishaqzai is known for his 
intellect and honesty, and will be missed in Nangarhar 
province.  However, he is definitely deserving of this 
appointment, and his good qualities should serve 
Baghlan province well.  There are unconfirmed rumors 
that Baghlan's previous governor, Sayed Ekramuddin, 
may move on to a highly ranked position in the 
Ministry of Interior in Kabul.
