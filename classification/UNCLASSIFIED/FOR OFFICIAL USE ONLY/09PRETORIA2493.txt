Poloff left messages with counterparts at the Department of 
International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) inviting any 
comments on the resolution prior to the upcoming UNGA vote 
(ref A).  No response was received, most likely because the 
topic has been at the heart of lengthy past discussions with 
DIRCO by both post and Department (IO/DRL) visitors (refs 
B-G), and the USG and SAG are each well acquainted with the 
stances of the other.  The SAG is an unwavering supporter of 
the resolution, which has its roots in the Durban Review 
Conference on racism and xenophobia held here in South 
Africa.  Given the country's apartheid history, this 
resolution is dear to the SAG, which sees it as a defense 
against prejudice rather than (in the U.S. view) a threat to 
freedom of speech.
