SUBJECT: COSTA RICA WILL SUPPORT COUNTRY-SPECIFIC 
RESOLUTIONS AT UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY THIRD COMMITTEE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 109397 
 
 The Government of Costa Rica (GOCR) will support 
country-specific resolutions on Iran, Burma, and the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the UN General 
Assembly's Third Committee, as it has done in previous years. 
 Foreign Ministry Director for Foreign Policy Alejandro 
Solano told us on October 27 that the GOCR remains concerned 
by the lack of human rights guarantees for the people in 
those countries as well as their government officials' 
reduction of opportunities for frank discussion with the 
international community about these issues.  The GOCR also 
will support the USG's resolution on free elections, as it 
feels strongly that there must be transparent processes that 
reflect the will of the people when they elect those who 
govern them.  Solano stated that, on principle, the GOCR 
always opposes no action motions, because they inhibit the 
discussion of positions and the making of decisions. 
Regarding the resolution on the rights of the child, he 
acknowledged the USG's interest in finding language that 
would allow it to join consensus.  He said Costa Rica was 
willing to consider USG proposals as long as they did not 
imply a reduction in the rights achieved by other countries. 
On the defamation of religion resolution, Solano indicated 
that the GOCR would consider our points and inform us at a 
later date of its decision.
