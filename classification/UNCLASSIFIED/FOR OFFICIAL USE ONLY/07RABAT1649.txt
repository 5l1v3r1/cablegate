SUBJECT: MOROCCO RESPONSE - WHO IGWG 5-10 NOVEMBER 
 
REF: STATE 144926 
 
¶1. (SBU) On October 25, econoff delivered points conveyed in 
reftel to Sellam Berrada, Chief of Staff for International 
Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Berrada 
was aware of the upcoming Intergovernmental Working Group 
(IGWG) meeting in Geneva November 5-10, but appeared 
completely unacquainted with the issues raised.  He was 
noncommittal in his remarks, commenting only that the points 
conveyed involved other ministries.  Berrada closed the 
meeting by pledging to share the information provided with 
the appropriate Moroccan officials and to inform us of any 
substantive response. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Morocco's new cabinet was just sworn-in on 
October 15, with all ministries experiencing differing levels 
of reorganization.  We doubt the GOM will be able to 
formulate a substantive response before the IGWG convenes on 
November 5.  End Comment.
