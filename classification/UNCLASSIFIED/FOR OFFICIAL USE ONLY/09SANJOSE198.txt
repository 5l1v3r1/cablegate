¶1. (SBU) On March 16, we spoke with Carlos Cordero of the 
MFA's Department for Disarmament, Terrorism, and Crime 
regarding Costa Rica's submission of their Annual Declaration 
(AD) for the Hague Code of Conduct (HCOC) Against Ballistic 
Missile Proliferation.  Cordero told us that they will work 
with their Hague Mission to try and submit the "nil form" on 
time.  We also provided him a copy of the nil form. 
 
¶2. (U) COMMENT: Costa Rica does not have space launch 
vehicle/ballistic missile programs.  END COMMENT.
