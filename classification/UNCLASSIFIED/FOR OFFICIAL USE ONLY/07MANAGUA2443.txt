¶1. (SBU) On November 6, Econoff delivered Ref A demarche, on 
the risk to World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha negotiations 
presented by ongoing Argentinean and Brazilian efforts to 
avoid cutting tariffs on industrial goods, to Ministry of 
Trade, Industry, and Development (MIFIC) Director General for 
International Trade Sonia Somarriba. She responded that, 
while she is unfamiliar with the specifics of the Argentinean 
and Brazilian efforts, Nicaragua seeks "commitments for 
balanced market access" in ongoing Doha Round World Trade 
Organization (WTO) negotiations among industrialized 
countries, larger developing economies such as Brazil and 
Argentina, and smaller developing economies such as 
Nicaragua.  Somarriba told us that MIFIC would not join the 
Nicaraguan delegation, led by President Ortega, to the 
November 8-10 Ibero-American Summit in Santiago, Chile. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Ortega, in his September 25 U.N. General 
Assembly speech and in other forums, has roundly criticized 
free trade and market economics (see Ref B).  Nonetheless, 
MIFIC officials, especially Somarriba (a holdover from the 
previous administration) and to some extent Minister Orlando 
Solorzano (see Ref C), are quietly supportive of U.S. 
positions on trade.  Given President Ortega's plans to lead 
the Nicaraguan delegation and the exclusion of MIFIC, we 
believe it would be counterproductive to ask the Nicaraguan 
delegation to raise this issue with Argentinean and Brazilian 
counterparts in Santiago.  End Comment.
