SUBJECT:  UNESCO:  Kosovo Experts' Meeting: Establishes 
Basis for Working with UNMIK; Lists 13 Priority Restoration 
Projects; USG to contribute USD 1 million 
 
¶1. (U) Summary.  A 9 December UNESCO Experts' Meeting on 
Kosovo resulted in an agreed list of 13 priorities (seven 
Orthodox, six Muslim) for cultural restoration and the basis 
for a cooperative working relationship with UNMIK.  The 
substantive part of the Expert Meeting, which took place in 
the presence of reps from UNMIK, UNESCO and the Council of 
Europe, was open only to the experts. 
 
Per a 19 December USG-UNESCO Agreement, USG will contribute 
1 million USD to the restoration of eight of the 13 sites 
recommended by the experts.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Amcit Ambassador Larry Rossin, the Principal Deputy 
Special Representative of the UN Secretary General in 
Kosovo, told poloff 9 December that his UN Mission in Kosovo 
(UNMIK) delegation held a good meeting with UNESCO Culture 
Sector head Mounir Bouchenaki 8 December.  Rossin reported 
that Bouchenaki had acknowledged UNMIK's leading role under 
UNSC Resolution 1244.  (Note.  An UNMIK rep reported that 
Bouchenaki also reiterated UNMIK's leading role during the 
December 9 Expert Meeting itself.  End note.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Bouchenaki also told Rossin 8 December that UNESCO 
was determined to avoid the political grandstanding that had 
marred the 13 May Donor's Conference.  Accordingly, at the 9 
December Expert Meeting, UNESCO Director General (DG) 
Koichoro Matsuura opened the meeting with a speech 
reiterating UNESCO's commitment to restoring cultural 
heritage in Kosovo and in all post-conflict areas. 
Bouchenaki then introduced the experts (see list para. 7, 
below) and announced that there would be a coffee break, to 
be followed by the technical meeting, which would be open 
only to the experts and the UNMIK, UNESCO and Council of 
Europe representatives.  The Greek and Serbian Ambassadors 
grumbled about this, but the restriction held.  (Note.  The 
DG has wide latitude under UNESCO Rules concerning 
classification of meetings to set the parameters of 
"Category VI" Expert Meetings.  End note.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to an UNMIK report, after the coffee 
break, UNMIK Principal Deputy Rossin was the first speaker. 
He explained that under UNSC Resolution 1244, UNMIK had the 
responsibility to ensure the protection and preservation of 
cultural heritage in Kosovo, along with the Provisional 
Institutions of Self Government established pursuant to the 
Constitutional Framework, including the Ministry of Culture, 
Youth and Sports (MCYS).  Rossin continued that the 
Reconstruction Implementation Commission (RIC) must be 
involved as well.  (Note.  Rossin had told DCM Koss and 
poloff 8 December that the RIC, chaired by the Council of 
Europe and including reps from the Serbian Orthodox Church, 
the MCYS and relevant Serb church authorities, is an example 
of successful cooperation among religious and ethnic groups 
involved in Kosovo.  End note.) 
 
¶5. (SBU) Rossin told poloff 9 December that the UNESCO 
undertaking to involve the RIC would likely need 
reinforcing, given the opposition to the RIC from some in 
Serbia and the leading role of long-time Serb UNESCO 
Ambassador Dragoljub Najman in UNESCO affairs. 
 
¶6. (U) The technical work proceeded smoothly, according to 
UNMIK reps. The experts recommended that seven Orthodox and 
six Islamic monuments in Kosovo should be the first to be 
restored over the next two years.  The sites recommended by 
the experts for restoration are: Cathedral Church of Christ 
the Saviour and Church of Bogorica Ljeviska and Hammam 
Mehmet Pasha (Prizren); Church of Saint Sava and Hamman 
(Mitrovic/Kosovska Mitrovica); Church of the Presentation 
of the Virgin (Lipjan/Lipljan); Church of Saint Archangel 
Michael (Shtime/Stimlje); Church of Saint Petka 
(Viti/Vitina), Budisavci Monastery (Klin/Klina); Red Mosque 
(Pej/Pec); Hadum Mosque (Gjakov/Dakovica); Dean/Decani 
Mosque; Hammam of Ali Bey (Vushtrri/Vucitrn). 
 
¶7. (U) Per a 19 December USG-UNESCO agreements, the USG will 
contribute USD 1 million to the restoration projects of 
eight of these sites.  The eight projects are: 
 
--Restoration of the Church of the Presentation of the 
Virgin, Lipjan/Lipljan, Lipjan/Lipljan municipality 
--Restoration/Reconstruction of the St. Sava Church in 
Kosovska Mitrovica

¶8. (U) The experts are: Jose Maria BALLESTER (Spain), 
Azedine BESCHAOUCH (Tunisia) Alessandro BIANCHI (Italy) Ros 
BORATH (Cambodia) Evangelia CHATZITRYFONOS (Greece) Slobodan 
CURIC (USA) Bernard FONQUERNIE (France) Branislav KRSTIC 
(Serbia and Montenegro) Saleh LAMEI (Egypt), Bisserka 
PENKOVA (Bulgaria) and Menmet IBRAHIMGIL (Turkey). 
 
¶9. (SBU) Comment.  UNESCO technical expert missions have 
made progress, despite politically charged atmospheres, as, 
for example, in the Old City of Jerusalem.   If the DG 
wisely uses his power to appoint experts and to set the 
rules of procedure, he can pave the way for keeping politics 
out.  Unfortunately, however, not all UNESCO experts 
meetings are de-politicized.  End comment.
