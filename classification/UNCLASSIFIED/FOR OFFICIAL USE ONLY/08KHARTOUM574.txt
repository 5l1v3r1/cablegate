¶1. (SBU) In a departure from the unofficial ceasefire between the 
Sudanese Government and the Sudan Liberation Movement 
(SLM)/Abdulwahid, three separate confrontations have erupted between 
their forces in recent days.  The first two rebel attacks occurred 
in East Jebel Marra on April 9 and 11 and precipitated a government 
bombing near Golo (90km east of Zalingei) that killed four civilians 
and wounded two, according to the UN Department of Safety and 
Security (UNDSS). 
 
¶2. (SBU) On April 13, an insurgent force ambushed Sudanese security 
officers near Khourtalaba, South Darfur (30km from Kaas).  The chief 
of military intelligence for Darfur, Col. Saeed Al Romyaziza, 
reported that at least 17 officers were killed in the bloody clash. 
In an April 13 meeting with CDA Fernandez, Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Undersecretary Mutriff Siddiq attributed the attack to 
"Junud Mazloumeen" (Oppressed Soldiers), a former pro-GOS faction 
affiliated with SLA/Abdulwahid.  Siddiq said that the perpetrators 
got away scot-free. Sudanese officials in Darfur left no doubt that 
the Government intended to retaliate for these rebel-initiated 
provocations. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Fighting also continued between the Sudanese Armed Forces 
(SAF) and the aggressive Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebel 
group in the northern part of West Darfur.  JEM attacked a military 
base in Kushkush (between Kulbus and Geneina) late last week, 
killing several soldiers and wounding 31, according to Siddiq.   He 
alleged that JEM used artillery in a two-pronged attack that 
included "their own Janjaweed," meaning fighters mounted on 
horseback and that overt Chadian support for JEM in the operation 
was obvious.  While admitting that JEM operations throughout the 
"northern corridor" of West Darfur have led to the deaths of SAF 
soldiers, Al Romyaziza also asserted that many rebels have died. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A JEM commander told Fieldoff on April 12 that the movement 
downed two Government helicopters in Jebel Moon on April 11, one of 
which resulted in considerable casualties.  (Note: As of April 14, 
there have been no reports of downed aircraft anywhere in the Darfur 
region. End note.) 
 
¶5. (SBU) Note: In addition to the violence in West Darfur, UNAMID 
officers have reported a surge in common crime in North Darfur, 
including the seizure of two UNAMID police cars and the slaying of 
an Omda (tribal leader) in the Abu Shouk IDP camp outside El Fasher. 
 As a result, NGOs and UNDSS are reviewing their security measures. 
While UNAMID is anticipating reprisals on both sides, the Deputy 
Force Commander ordered no change in the force's posture during the 
April 14 morning briefing.  Embassy Khartoum's EAC met April 13 to 
discuss the upsurge in fighting and security incidents in Darfur 
(ref a).  Since El Fasher and Nyala are stable with an even greater 
presence of uniformed SAF troops (due to the recent unpaid janjaweed 
demonstrations - ref b) the EAC decided to keep staff in place but 
will review the situation again as the situation warrants, including 
in anticipation of next week's controversial national census. End 
note. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: The SLA ambush of SAF forces is significant and 
will likely precipitate a disproportionate response on the part of 
the SAF, with additional bombings and attacks.  This is unfortunate 
because until recently Jebel Mara has been a relative oasis of calm 
in comparison with the corridor north of El Geneina in West Darfur 
where the SAF released its fury against areas that had been occupied 
by JEM.  Some observers have linked the recent upsurge in fighting 
in Darfur to the census, as rebel groups are unanimously against the 
census and want to ensure that their areas are too unstable for the 
census to occur.
