Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Officials from the Japanese Embassy in Kabul are 
anxious to restart work on their portion of the Ring Road 
between Kandahar and Herat as soon as possible. The Japanese 
Government is considering all options, including recontracting 
the work to a non-Japanese contractor. The US Army Corps of 
Engineers (USACE) offered to assist as a construction agent for 
the Japanese government, keeping the focus clearly on the 
Japanese assistance to Afghanistan and not on USACE's role in 
the project. Japanese Embassy officials were interested in the 
offer, but noted that Tokyo would make the final decision. 
End Summary.

Japanese Considering Three Options 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On May 18, Japanese Embassy officials discussed 
options for resuming work on their portion of the Ring Road 
between Kandahar and Herat with Embassy, AID, CFC-A and 
USACE officials.  DCM Moto Kato, Japan International Cooperation 
System (JICS) Representative Toru Takagi, and Defense Attache 
LTC Hiroshi Shimohata attended for the Japanese.  Kato 
noted that the project is a commitment between JICS 
and the Afghan Ministry of Public Works (MPW).  Two 
Japanese companies subcontract the work from JICS, one 
for consulting (design) and the other for 
construction.  Kato stated that the Japanese were very 
anxious to move the project forward and that Tokyo is 
currently considering three options. 
 
-- First option: Find a way to continue road work with the 
two contractors already engaged. 
-- Second option: Keep the Japanese consulting company, but 
hire another (non-Japanese) company for the construction. 
-- Third option: Hire outside companies for both aspects of 
the project.

¶3.  (SBU) USACE described how they could assist as a 
construction agent for the Japanese government, 
keeping the focus clearly on the Japanese assistance 
to Afghanistan and not on USACE's role in the project. 
USACE noted that they could handle the entire project, 
including contracting the work and providing program 
management and quality control services.  This would 
be the ideal and most efficient method for the Corps, plus 
it would ensure security was an inherent part of the 
contract work from the construction camps outward. 
Alternatively, USACE could play a more limited role, 
for instance providing program management for JICS' 
existing construction contract.  USACE emphasized that 
security services should be included in the 
construction contract(s), but noted that USACE can 
play a crucial role by ensuring that contractors live 
up to their security commitments and by liaising with the 
local PRTs and local Afghan National Army and Police 
units to let them know that they are working in their 
region.  USACE emphasized that they were achieving 
success on other road projects in Afghanistan by 
hiring local firms, and suggested this may be a viable 
course of action for whomever executed the work. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Kato asked if USACE could provide security 
services only.  USACE responded that they can provide 
security advisory services, but that they do not 
provide protective services.  USACE noted that their 
program management services include evaluating and 
monitoring contractor-provided security to meet USACE 
standards, and that this would provide more security 
than simply engaging USACE in an advisory role.  USACE 
stressed that no US soldiers would be available for 
assignment as security to this project in any 
scenario.  USACE noted that if they let out a new 
contract for road segment, work could begin as early 
as mid-August.  If USACE were to provide project 
management services for the existing construction 
contract, the timetable for restarting construction 
would largely depend on the existing contractor. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Kato was appreciative of USACE's willingness 
to take on the project and committed to pass this 
information back to Tokyo.  USACE, in turn, agreed to 
provide a written proposal to the Japanese Embassy 
 
KABUL 00002285  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
outlining how USACE could work with JICS. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment:  The Japanese are fully aware of 
the strategic importance of moving forward quickly on 
the Kandahar-Herat road (despite the fact they 
halted further work on the project last February) 
and are also anxious to keep a Japanese face on the 
project. The Japanese were pleased with USACE's assurances 
that their involvement would be transparent, keeping 
the focus on Japanese assistance.  The Japanese Embassy 
made it clear that the final decision would be made 
in Tokyo.  End comment.
