SUBJECT: IN PASSOVER INTERVIEWS, SHARON WARNS ARAFAT, 
AFFIRMS DISENGAGEMENT, SHRUGS OFF SCANDALS 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Israel's three major dailies previewed April 2 the 
separate Passover interviews with PM Sharon that each will 
publish on April 5.  The previews highlighted three of 
Sharon's themes: 
 
-- Targeting Arafat and Nasrallah: In the wake of Israel's 
assassination of Hamas leader Sheikh Yassin, neither Arafat 
nor Hizballah leader Nasrallah has "insurance against 
targeting."  "I wouldn't suggest either of them feels 
immune.... Anyone who kills a Jew or harms an Israeli 
citizen, or sends people to kill Jews, is a marked man. 
Period." 
 
-- Gaza Disengagement: "By next Passover we will be deep into 
disengagement."  The PM insisted that he made the decision to 
disengage from Gaza and that he is determined to see it 
through: "No one influenced me and no one convinced me. 
That's nonsense.  Arik convinced Sharon and Sharon convinced 
Arik.  It's my decision and I intend to carry it out."  The 
PM did not expect terrorist attacks against Israel to stop 
after disengagement, but did hope for a reduction.  In any 
event, Israel's war against terror would continue, and even 
step up, after withdrawal from Gaza.  The PM stated that the 
GOI does not intend to damage the electrical or water 
infrastructure of areas to be evacuated, and that it would 
continue to supply electricity and water to Gaza even after 
disengagement.  The GOI would reconsider this service, 
however, if terror attacks continue from Gaza after Israel 
withdraws. 
 
-- Possible Indictment: "I believe in my full and complete 
innocence." "I'm certain there won't be an indictment." "I'm 
functioning normally." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Apart from their Sharon interviews, the three 
dailies do not appear to have any other Passover interviews 
of political significance in store.  Ma'ariv will publish an 
interview with incoming IDF Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Halutz. 
 Ma'ariv will also present an interview with former PM Barak, 
but the blurb promoting the interview does not suggest Barak 
conveying anything more than a makeover of his unlovable 
image.  Below a photo, framed in daisy petals, of a smiling 
Barak clutching purple anemones appears the teaser: "Ehud 
Barak reveals all.... The interview we've all be waiting for 
in which the former PM speaks about his separation from Nava 
(ex-Mrs. Barak), about Nili (the new girlfriend), about 
aging, fears, emotional autism and the mistakes of the past."
