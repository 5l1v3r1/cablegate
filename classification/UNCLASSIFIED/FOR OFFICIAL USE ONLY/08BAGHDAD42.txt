SUBJECT: WAIVER REQUESTED -- Section 565 Waiver of Prohibition 
against Contracting with Firms that comply with the Arab League 
Boycott or Discriminate in the Basis of Religion 
 
REF: STATE 166398 
 
¶1. (SBU) Section 565 of Title V, Part C of the Foreign Relations 
Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (PL 103-236, 22 USC 
2679c) prohibits the Department of State from entering into any 
contract, except real estate leases and contracts below the small 
purchase threshold (currently $100,000), that expends funds 
appropriated to the Department of State with a foreign person that 
complies with the Arab League boycott of Israel, or with any foreign 
or United States person that discriminates in the award of 
subcontracts on the basis of religion. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Reftel requested that Posts that will not be able to carry 
on diplomatic functions while meeting either or both of the 
requirements of Section 565 send a cable requesting a waiver of the 
relevant requirement(s) and justifying the request. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post's request for waiver for 2007 stated, "Iraq does not 
maintain diplomatic relations with Israel.  The U.S. Embassy in 
Baghdad has reported instances in which Iraqi agencies have sought 
to enforce compliance with boycott requirements.  The current 
requirements of Iraqi law in this regard are not clear, and this has 
been the subject of ongoing discussions between the USG and the GOI. 
 The Embassy believes that local firms would generally be unable to 
provide the certification necessary under Section 565.  Therefore, 
without a waiver, the Embassy would potentially be unable to obtain 
essential supplies and services in-country." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post's experience over the contracting year has indicated 
that, despite previous presumptions to the contrary, local firms 
contracting with Post's GSO Contracting Officer have in all cases 
been able to provide the certification necessary under Section 565. 
The Embassy's ability to obtain essential supplies and services, to 
the extent that these are procured in-country, has not been 
hampered.  Nonetheless, not all agencies at Post have been able to 
obtain the necessary certification. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Iraq does not maintain diplomatic relations with Israel. 
While, the Department of State has included the boycott 
noncompliance clause outlined under Section 565 in all 
GSO-originated contracts in 2007, the current requirements of Iraqi 
law remain unclear.  Post therefore must request a waiver because of 
ambiguities under Iraqi law and potential compliance with the 
boycott by subcontracting entities. 
 
¶6. (SBU) For the reasons stated in para 5 above, Post requests a 
waiver of the relevant requirement(s) of Section 565.
