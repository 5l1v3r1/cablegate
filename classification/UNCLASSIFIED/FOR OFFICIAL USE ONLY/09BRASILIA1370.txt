¶1.  (SBU) On November 25, Science Counselor discussed the proposal 
for establishing a nuclear fuel bank (per REFTELS B and C) with the 
Director of Brazil's Ministry of External Relations' (MRE) 
Department of Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies, Minister 
Santiago Mourao.  As indicated in REFTEL C, the Government of Brazil 
(GOB) has interest in discussing the proposal for a nuclear fuel 
bank at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but at this 
time Brazil still has various questions it would like to see 
clarified. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Mourao said that it was "premature" for the IAEA to be 
taking a decision on the Russian proposal at the upcoming Board of 
Governors (BOG) meeting.  He said that the Brazilian Ambassador in 
Vienna had raised their concerns during the recent meeting in Vienna 
on the proposal.  Brazil was particularly interested in knowing how 
would a nuclear fuel bank work, when and under what circumstances 
could a country obtain access, and what were the criteria for a 
country to participate in the program. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) A small working group, including Brazil and also some 
countries that are likely participants in such a program (for 
example, Malaysia), should be set up to look more in depth at the 
question, suggested Mourao.  He added that their Ambassador in 
Vienna had been "unleashed" and so had ample authority to handle 
this issue from Vienna. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) COMMENT.  If a vote comes up at this IAEA BOG, Brazil 
would most likely not vote in favor.  Mourao was unclear about 
whether they would abstain or vote against.  However, the MRE 
generally does not like to break consensus or be seen as the country 
blocking a decision, unless the question is of vital interest.  Post 
believes that if the majority of member states at the IAEA BOG are 
in favor of the proposal, then Brazil will most likely abstain.  END 
COMMENT.
