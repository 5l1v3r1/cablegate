¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Two-thirds of Bissau-Guineans depend upon 
cashews for their livelihood.  Cashews constitute Guinea-Bissau's 
primary export, but only two or three percent of total production is 
processed in the country.  Most of the remainder is sold to India 
for processing.  USAID and OPIC had an enormous impact on 
revitalizing the cashew sector following the 1998-99 civil war, and 
in 2005, production totaled approximately 100,000 tons.  American 
buyers and investors are active.  However, improper drying damaged 
Guinea-Bissau's reputation with buyers, and GOGB insistence on 
setting a reference price above the world market price in 2006 may 
yet lead to a food crisis.  The Embassy organized a full-day seminar 
on the sector last month, building on USAID's efforts to create a 
dynamic African Cashew Alliance.  At the seminar, we pushed for 
allowing market forces to set prices -- a message that the 
Ambassador reiterated during her September 27-28 visit.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) The following information is provided in response to 
questions in reftel and the interest expressed by the USITC for 
information on Guinea-Bissau's cashew sector.  Washington agencies 
should keep in mind that there is currently no U.S. Embassy in 
Bissau, nor any full-time official American presence.  Our ability 
to support TDY travel to Guinea-Bissau is limited.  In general, 
responses cover calendar year 2005, but where possible we have 
included information regarding events in 2006. 
 
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
---------------------------- 
¶3.  (U) In 2005, Guinea-Bissau's GDP growth is estimated to have 
recovered from an average of 0.5 percent for 2003-2004 to 3.5 
percent, thanks to a good agricultural performance.  Average 
consumer price inflation rose to 3.4 percent from 0.8 percent in 
2004 as a result of higher import prices on oil and rice. 
Guinea-Bissau's budget deficit (including grants) was lower than 
programmed at 12 percent of GDP, compared to 15 percent in 2004, 
owing to stronger than projected tax revenues and lower non wage 
expenditures.  The current account deficit worsened in 2005 because 
of a large increase in imports and a drop in official transfers and 
private remittances.  In 2005, earnings from cashews, the main 
export crop, were boosted by a substantial increase in world prices 
as well as a further expansion in production.  However, as noted 
below, in 2006, export revenue from cashews dropped due to poor GOGB 
policies. 
 
¶4.  (U) The macroeconomic outlook for 2006-7 is mixed.  Problems in 
the cashew sector will have a major impact on incomes and export 
earnings.  At the same time, the GOGB has begun to implement some 
limited economic reform measures.  There are indications of 
heightened interest by foreign investors, particularly to support 
petroleum exploration and tourism.  An international donors' 
conference on Guinea-Bissau is to be held in Geneva in November 
¶2006.  Additional donor assistance should help speed reforms and 
bring additional revenue into the country, potentially impacting 
broad range of economic sectors. 
 
CASHEW SITUATION 
---------------- 
¶5.  (SBU) Cashews have been considered the "gold" of Guinea-Bissau 
with an annual production of approximately 100,000 metric tons of 
raw nuts.  About one million people earn their livelihood from the 
sector, and traditionally, the quality of Guinea-Bissau's cashews is 
considered good.  However, in 2006, the GOGB gravely interfered in 
the cashew sector.  During the 2006 cashew season, the GOGB 
established a minimum gate price higher than the world market price. 
 Prime Minister Aristides Gomes declared the reference value of raw 
cashews at CFA francs (CFAF) 350 per kilo (approximately USD 0.70), 
CFAF 150-200 above the world market price, in order to help the 
farmers increase their revenues, according to the government's 
Commercial Director in the Commerce Ministry.  However, the 
Government did not subsidize the price difference.  (COMMENT: 
Reportedly, the GOGB's goal was additional tax revenue from the 
higher reference value.  Export taxes on raw cashews are 8 percent, 
and cashew exports account for almost 93 percent of all exports. 
END COMMENT.) 
 
¶6.  (U) Post-harvest, government inspectors were sent into the 
countryside to ensure that farmers did not sell raw nuts below the 
government price.  Cashew shellers attest that when farmers were 
caught selling their nuts to buyers at below the government's 
 
DAKAR 00002418  002 OF 003 
 
 
declared price, they were fined, harassed, and sometimes had sacks 
of rice (GB's main food staple) taken away as "fines" by the 
inspectors.  Such intimidation successfully prevented most farmers 
from selling their nuts at market prices.  However, buyers refused 
to pay more than the world market price.  Consequently, the nuts 
went unsold until the GOGB, at the end of the season, allowed the 
farmers unfettered access to the market.  Unfortunately, the 
farmers, in desperate need of money to buy rice and other basic 
goods, released their raw nuts onto the market at the same time, 
pushing prices down below CFAF 100 per kilo.  Some farmers have 
pursued a long-standing tradition of barter, raw nuts for rice, but 
now must offer more nuts for less rice. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The GOGB's policy error has seriously damaged economic 
growth, which may result in food shortages.  It is estimated that 
only 60,000 tons of raw nuts have been sold and that 30,000 tons of 
2006 raw nuts remain, sitting in warehouses which do not provide 
adequate environmental control for the nuts to retain their value. 
Guinea-Bissau does not produce enough rice or any other food staple 
to feed its population; so those who rely on cashews to make a 
living (about 80 percent of families nationwide) could have 
difficulty in purchasing enough food in the coming year.  Earnings 
from next year's crop are also expected to decline because quality 
will deteriorate if farmers mix the new crop with the 2006 crop 
remaining on hand. 
 
¶8.  (U) Another factor that hurt producers in 2006 was the fact that 
a significant amount of the 2005 harvest was not dried properly; so 
buyers had to throw away large amounts of moldy cashews and thus 
they were less willing to buy Guinea-Bissau cashews this year.  Only 
50 percent of last year's buyers came back in 2006, decreasing 
competition for Bissau-Guinean nuts. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) The GOGB requires foreign cashew buyers to use free on 
board (FOB) terms, and buyers claim that Guniea-Bissau's cashew 
export taxes are the highest export taxes in Africa (approximately 
50 CFAF/Kg).  There is one main growers association, the National 
Growers Association of Guinea-Bissau (listed below), but it is not 
well organized in the field.  They do not have experience with 
quality training or information on world market prices, and 
therefore have very limited ability to make informed decisions on 
whether to sell or at what prices.  A few organizations, including 
the USG, the World Bank and NGOs, are working with the Government to 
eliminate interference in cashew pricing. 
 
¶10.  (U) Exports of processed cashews are tax-free, but processed 
cashew exports represent only 2-3 percent of Guinea Bissau's 
production.  While Guinea-Bissau's processing industry is limited, 
it is improving in efficiency, quality, and international marketing, 
in large part due to USAID's contracts with Enterprise Works and 
participation in the relatively new USAID-coordinated African Cashew 
Alliance (ACA).  An American company, Rota International (RI), 
managed by Guida Blacken in Bissau, exports processed organic nuts 
to the American market.  It most recently shipped 16 tons of 
processed nuts to Norfolk, Virginia.  The processed cashews were 
sourced from RI's own small cooperatives of cashew processors and 
from two larger scale shellers: Si-Cajou and Agri-Bissau. 
 
¶11.  (U) With technical assistance and credit assistance from the 
local foundation Fundei, several processing units have been 
established since 2000.  Their capacity ranges from 240-1000 tons 
per year with a total capacity of around 5,000 tons.  Big units like 
Sicaju (1,000 tons) produce for the export market.  Smaller units 
Emicor and Djonde Lda mainly produce for the domestic and regional 
markets, though they export occasionally in a joint effort with 
others (including Rota International and Global Trading).  However, 
all factories report the same problem: a limited number of banks and 
the lack of financing to purchase raw material.
