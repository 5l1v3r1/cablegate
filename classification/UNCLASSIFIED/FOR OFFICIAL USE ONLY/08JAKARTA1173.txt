¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: On June 9, 2008, Attorney 
General Mukasey visited Jakarta to meet with 
Attorney General Supandji, Indonesian National 
Police (INP) Chief Sutanto, and other 
Indonesian officials.  While issues of 
terrorism remained high on the agenda, AG 
Mukasey also focused on cooperation regarding 
corruption, trafficking in persons, and asset 
forfeiture, reflecting the growing breadth of 
DOJ engagement in Indonesia.  The visit was 
highlighted by the signing of an agreement to 
provide US support for the development of an 
elite Anti-Corruption Task Force within the 
AGO.  DOJ assistance programs have led to 
tangible gains to the laws, policies and 
institutions involved in rule of reform, all of 
which are essential to IndonesiaQs continued 
democratic progress.  End Summary. 
 
Attorneys General Launch Anti- 
Corruption Task Force 
-------------------------------------- 
------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)    AG Mukasey and the Ambassador met 
with Indonesian AG Supandji on June 9.  AG 
MukaseyQs visit was the first visit by any 
foreign attorney general to Jakarta since 
Attorney General GonzalesQ trip in November 
¶2006. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) During the visit, the Attorneys 
General signed an agreement to support the 
development of the Anti-Corruption Task Force 
at the AGO.  This task force will be 
responsible for prosecuting high-level, complex 
corruption cases and recovering assets stolen 
through corruption.  As part of the agreement 
signed during the visit, DOJ/OPDAT will use 
$750,000 in INL funds to support the task force 
with equipment, expert support, and other 
expenses.  During their private meeting, AG 
Supandji described how that the prosecutors 
would be divided into specialized teams 
focusing on five areas --banking, procurement, 
IT, public services, and asset recovery -- and 
noted the rigorous selection process of task 
force prosecutors. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The establishment of the Anti- 
Corruption Task Force reflects a major change 
in organizational thinking at the AGO (Ref A). 
The AGO has traditionally taken an assembly 
line approach to cases, dividing prosecutors 
only into pre-prosecution, prosecution, and 
execution of judgment units.  By assigning 
 
JAKARTA 00001173  002.2 OF 004 
 
 
prosecutors to specific types of crimes for the 
duration of the case, this new approach will 
ensure greater case continuity, better 
coordination with the police,and more 
professional accountability in complex cases. 
In addition, the competitive process for 
selecting the task force members was 
unprecedented.  Deputy Attorney General for 
Special Crimes (Corruption) Marwan Effendy 
personally interviewed each candidate and 
required each one to submit a personal wealth 
statement as an added ethical precaution. 
 
AGs Discuss Reform Process, Areas for 
Partnership 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
-- 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  AG Mukasey also discussed the 
progress in combatting terrorism and 
transnational crime, noting the recent lifting 
of the State DepartmentQs Travel Warning to 
Indonesia as a tangible sign of that progress. 
They discussed the importance of criminal 
procedure reform as an important step to 
increasing police-prosecutor cooperation, which 
would lead to greater success in the courtroom 
(Ref B).  AG Mukasey also commended the AGO on 
its progress in combatting trafficking in 
persons (TIP) (Ref C).  AG Mukasey observed 
that the U.S. remained interested in exploring 
a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), noting 
that the ability of Indonesia to compel the 
production of evidence in response to a U.S. 
request was critical (Ref D).  Finally, AG 
Supandji noted the need to build human capacity 
within the AGO, specifically identifying the 
area of asset tracing.  AG Mukasey agreed, also 
stressing the benefits of having a law 
permitting civil asset forfeiture of illegal 
proceeds (Ref E). 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  AG Mukasey visited with the AGO 
prosecutors of the Terrorism and Transnational 
Crime Task Force, a DOJ/OPDAT-implemented, S/CT 
and INL-funded unit of 22 prosecutors.  The 
task force has successfully prosecuted 43 
Indonesian terrorists, including 26 Jamaah 
Islamiyah members, as well as a number of 
significant TIP and money laundering cases in 
less than two years of operation (Ref G).  Its 
success in terrorism cases has been due in 
large part to overcoming the lack of 
coordination between prosecutors and the police 
that typically exists in Indonesia. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  During a joint press conference, AG 
Mukasey commented on the broadening areas of 
cooperation between the U.S. and Indonesia.  He 
first noted the success of existing U.S.- 
Indonesian cooperation in the area of 
terrorism.  He then highlighted the importance 
of combating corruption and recovering stolen 
 
JAKARTA 00001173  003.2 OF 004 
 
 
assets, pledging the support of the U.S. in 
assisting the new Anti-Corruption Task Force. 
Finally, he recognized the valuable cooperation 
between the U.S. and Indonesia on TIP.  The 
press conference received extensive and 
positive coverage in the television and print 
media. 
 
AG Mukasey-Police Chief Sutanto Seek to Expand 
Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
----------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  AG Mukasey next met with Indonesian 
National Police Chief Sutanto.  General Sutanto 
thanked AG Mukasey for DOJQs cooperation on 
terorrism matters.  AG Mukasey thanked Sutanto 
for the Indonesian policeQs assistance in the 
case involving Tamil Tigers arms dealer 
Thavarajah Pratheepan.  The two officials also 
discussed the possibility of having INP 
officers travel to the US to testify at 
PratheepanQs trial in December.  Sutanto 
thanked the FBI for providing forensic 
assistance in the case of poisoned human rights 
activist Munir and for assistance in returning 
corruption fugitive David Nusa Wajaya.  He also 
noted FBI assistance in the successful 
investigation and prosecution of a group of 
Papuan separatists responsible for the 2002 
murders of two American school teachers in 
Timika, Papua.  Sutanto praised the work of 
DOJ/ICITAP, with his staff noting its 
contributions in the areas of TIP, money 
laundering, and forensics.  Sutanto identified 
terrorism financing as an area where assistance 
from the DOJ would be appreciated.  DOJ/ICITAP 
will launch an assistance project later this 
year directed at upgrading the INPQs capacity 
to combat terrorism financing.  AG Mukasey 
noted that FBI Director Mueller would be 
visiting in July and would also be able to 
provide assistance. 
 
AG Mukasey Meets Legal Reform Leaders at 
Reception 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
--- 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  The Ambassador held a reception for 
AG Mukasey to conclude his visit.  AG Mukasey 
had an opportunity to speak with the eighty- 
five guests, which included a broad cross- 
section of the Indonesian legal community, 
including participants from the USG-funded SMU 
Rule of Law program who had met with AG Mukasey 
in Washington last month.  AG Mukasey provided 
encouragement to the head of the new criminal 
procedure code drafting team, noting the 
importance of this project.  In his general 
remarks, AG Mukasey reiterated both the 
broadening and deepening of the law enforcement 
partnership between the U.S. and Indonesia and 
 
JAKARTA 00001173  004.2 OF 004 
 
 
noted the largely peaceful progress Indonesia 
has made toward democracy and the rule of law 
over the past ten years.
