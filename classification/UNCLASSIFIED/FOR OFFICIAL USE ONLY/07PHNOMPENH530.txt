Meeting with PM Hun Sen 
----------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Director Tschetter thanked the Prime Minister 
for the warmth and hospitality with which Peace Corps had been 
received in Cambodia.  He talked about the ability of Peace Corps 
Volunteers (PCVs) to learn from their Cambodian colleagues and host 
families and bring that understanding back to America.  He 
emphasized the need to build understanding and friendship, as well 
as technical skills, to make a better future for both countries.  He 
closed by inviting the Prime Minister to visit the Peace Corps 
Offices in Washington. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The Prime Minister mentioned that he was 
particularly moved that the Peace Corps Volunteers took an oath to 
serve the interests of the people of America, and was glad that they 
would be serving the interests of the Cambodian people as well.  He 
was impressed in seeing PCVs speaking the Khmer language on 
television, and heard positive comments from people in the training 
communities.  The PM is confident that the PCVs will be integrated 
into Cambodian society and become a part of their new families.  He 
assured Director Tschetter with respect to the safety of the PCVs in 
their communities, and hoped that the experience will bind together 
the peoples of Cambodia and the United States. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The Ambassador offered his congratulations on the recent 
commune elections and summarized the observations of the Embassy 
election monitoring teams.  He noted that the elections were orderly 
and peaceful, and candidates appeared to be respectful of one 
another. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The Prime Minister responded by noting the importance of 
a multi-party system for a sustainable democracy.  He said that if 
there is cooperation before an election, everyone can feel safe 
after the election.  He added that PCVs can help to educate 
Cambodian people about democracy, multi-party political systems and 
transparent elections.  One day CPP will lose the election, said the 
PM, and when that happens, he will be glad to transfer authority to 
a new Prime Minister.
