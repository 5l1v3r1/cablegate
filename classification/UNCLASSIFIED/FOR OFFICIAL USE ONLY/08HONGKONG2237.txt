¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Hong Kong,s Health Secretary confirmed on 
December 11 that the H5 Avian Influenza (AI) virus 
responsible for the deaths of over 200 chickens on December 9 
was the H5N1 strain.  No human associated cases of Avian 
Influenza have been reported.  The source of the virus 
outbreak remains undetermined, but is thought to have 
originated outside the farm; there is no evidence supporting 
press speculation it was introduced through fertilized eggs 
smuggled into Hong Kong. Post AI Working Group (AIWG) met 
December 12 and confirmed that medical stocks were 
inventoried and appropriate Consular Warden messages were up 
to date. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Hong Kong Health Secretary Dr. York Chow has 
confirmed that the December 9 H5 Avian Influenza outbreak in 
a large commercial farm in Hong Kong is the H5N1 strain. 
There have been no reported or suspected human-associated AI 
cases in Hong Kong; as a precaution, six farm workers from 
the original contamination site have been placed in isolation 
at a local hospital for monitoring, but remain asymptomatic 
(Reftel). According to press reporting, Chow said extensive 
testing at markets and other farms across the territory have 
turned up negative, suggesting the outbreak has been 
contained.  Although unable to confirm the virus source, Chow 
stated the outbreak is not likely to have originated inside 
the farm and there was no evidence to suggest the virus was 
introduced through smuggled fertilized eggs, as some poultry 
industry insiders are suggesting.  Chow appealed to anyone in 
the industry with knowledge of egg smuggling to come forward 
so the allegations may be aggressively investigated. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In light of the H5N1 confirmation, the Consulate 
General convened a meeting of the Avian Influenza Working 
Group (AIWG) on December 12 to discuss the week's 
developments and review the Consulate,s AI response planning 
and procedures.  The Medical Unit reported stocks of 
antiviral medications, masks, sanitizers, and other materials 
were recently inventoried and the health unit is well-stocked 
at recommended levels.  The Consular section reported that it 
released a Warden Message on December 10 notifying the AMCIT 
community in Hong Kong of the virus discovery and providing 
additional information and websites where citizens could go 
for updates.
