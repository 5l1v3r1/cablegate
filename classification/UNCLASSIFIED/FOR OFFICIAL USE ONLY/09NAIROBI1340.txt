Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, Post submits the following update for 
the first and third weeks of June 2009.  End summary. 
 
------------- 
PD Activities 
------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Somalia Unit, including the Military Information 
Support Team (MIST) dedicated to Somalia, performed para. 
3-11 activities since the last report: 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post has developed a strategy for assisting the TFG, 
especially the Ministry of Information, in revamping their 
outreach efforts.  We consulted with a wide variety of Somali 
and international professionals on the outline of the plan, 
and have identified two distinguished media professionals to 
do an initial needs assessment in Mogadishu.  The plan 
includes an effort to revitalize Radio Mogadishu, a proposal 
for a government newspaper, and professional training for 
designated TFG spokespersons.  Post has requested funds from 
AF for the assessment. 
 
¶4. (SBU) PAO traveled to Dadaab refugee camps in Northeast 
Kenya from June 15-17 with four American writers affiliated 
with the Iowa Writing Program (septel).  The writers also 
conducted a session in Nairobi's Eastleigh neighborhood, and 
did some Kenya-specific programs in conjunction with Kenya 
PAS.  The writers conducted sessions with nearly 250 youth 
during their highly successful visit to Kenya. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Ambassador Ranneberger hosted a background 
discussion on Somalia with international media outlets on 
June 11.  The journalists, from the New York Times, LA Times, 
and BBC World Service, were all extremely grateful for the 
opportunity to review Somalia policy with the Ambassador. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Post issued a press release after a suicide bomber 
killed Security Minister Omar Hashi.  The release was carried 
widely.  We also issued press releases condemning the death 
of journalist Mukhtar Hirabe on June 7 and the 
double-amputations carried out on four young men on June 25. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Ambassador visited wounded Somalis elders and TFG 
officials at a Nairobi hospital on June 26 (septel).  The 
Ambassador then made remarks to assembled Somali and Kenyan 
press.  The event received positive coverage. 
 
¶8. (SBU) PAO made remarks on June 29 at an NDI conference on 
the TFG's website, which is in development under a 
Norway-funded initiative.  PAO focused on the importance of 
outreach, even as the TFG is repelling an armed offensive, 
and the U.S. role in that effort.  Conference participants, 
the majority of whom were TFG communications professionals, 
uniformly thanked the USG for its efforts in Somalia. 
 
¶9. (SBU) MIST activity, week of June 15: Teams traveled to 
Dadaab with PAO to assist in the visit of the writers 
associated with the Iowa Writers Program.  During the visit, 
MIST met with several community groups, including a drama 
group and a soccer league, to explore options for Public 
Diplomacy programming in the camps. 
 
¶10. (SBU) MIST is continuing to plan and develop programs in 
support of the TFG and to counter Al-Shabaab recruiting 
efforts in central Somalia.  These programs are pending 
approval and contracting support. 
 
¶11. (SBU) MIST activity: MIST is rebroadcasting a live 
concert throughout Somalia on Radio Daljir and affiliates in 
support of the current Peace & Reconciliation program.  The 
airing will aim to discourage youth  from participating in 
terrorist and criminal activities and to support future peace 
& reconciliation initiatives.
