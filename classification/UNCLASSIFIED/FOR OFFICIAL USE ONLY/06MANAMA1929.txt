(SBU) Pol/Econ Chief November 14 delivered Ref A demarche 
concerning the re-election of U.S. candidate Michael Matheson 
to the International Law Commission (ILC) to MFA Director for 
International Organization Affairs Ghassan Shaikho.  Shaikho 
said that Bahrain had still not made a final decision on who 
among the WEOG candidates it would support but indicated his 
willingness for Bahrain to vote for Mr. Matheson.  He noted 
that Bahrain's approach to ILC elections is to ensure that 
representatives from countries with various types of legal 
systems are present so there is a full debate of issues 
before the Commission.
