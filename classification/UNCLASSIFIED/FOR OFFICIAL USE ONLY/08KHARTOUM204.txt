¶1. (SBU) Summary: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) Assistant Secretary General for Protection Erika Feller told 
the diplomatic community on February 7 that the purpose of her visit 
to eastern Sudan was to highlight the problem of "protracted" 
refugees. The Geneva-based Feller said that eastern Sudan has nearly 
100,000 refugees, some of whom have been refugees for four decades 
and have been forgotten by the international community. Feller 
outlined plans to work with the Sudanese government refugee 
coordinator to improve understanding of refugee needs and to improve 
services for existing refugees while transitioning to an emphasis on 
refugee self-sufficiency.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) UNHCR A/SYG for Protection Feller said that UNHCR plans to 
shift from programs that encourage dependency to a focus on 
long-term refugee self-sustainability.  Feller said that UNHCR plans 
"protracted refugee pilot programs" in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, 
Tanzania, the Balkans, and eastern Sudan.  She said the eastern 
Sudan problem is probably the most complicated of any refugee 
situation because it is long-term in nature and because the problem 
continues to grow. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Currently, eastern Sudan has an estimated 92,000 camp-based 
Eritreans, 28,000 Eritreans not in need of international assistance, 
and 1,000 Eritreans in urban settings, said Feller.  She added that 
in 2007 up to 11,000 Eritreans and nearly 1,000 Somalis fled to 
Sudan and formally applied for asylum.  The number of refugees 
already living in Sudan continues to increase because the root cause 
of the Eritrean refugee problem remains unchanged, said Feller.  The 
main causes that prompt Eritreans to flee are the ongoing conflict 
with Ethiopia, forced military recruitment of Eritreans, and "human 
rights abuses such as sexual violence against women." 
 
¶4. (SBU) To address current and future needs, UNHCR will work with 
the Government of Sudan's (GOS) Coordinator for Refugees (COR) to 
improve the management of current services.  Central to this effort 
will be a UNHCR-COR joint assessment mission to the refugee camps 
and population centers, an enhanced refugee registration program to 
enable improved refugee profiling, and a more efficient asylum 
process.  With better information about refugee populations, UNHCR 
and COR hope to improve feeding and nutrition programs to refugees. 
In addition, UNHCR plans to enhance educational opportunities for 
urban youth refugees and develop solutions to improve local 
integration of refugees. 
 
¶5. (SBU) However, UNHCR and COR foresee continued problems based on 
the regional political environment. These include the possibility of 
future large-scale refugee inflows due to conflict, and recruitment 
for further conflict. Feller said UNHCR and the International Red 
Cross and Red Crescent are planning for possible large scale refugee 
inflows.  However, she cautioned that the long-term response will be 
limited by the lack for offers of resettlement and donor financial 
systems that cannot transition from humanitarian disaster assistance 
to development programs for the same refugee populations. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: The situation for Eritrean refugees inside Sudan 
is always precarious.  There are increasing reports of refoulements 
and general round-ups of Eritreans in the country, despite the 
government's assurances that it would not engage in such practices. 
In the case of a future large scale influx of refugees in the east, 
UNHCR would likely redeploy some of its staff currently based in 
Darfur.
