SUBJECT: MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE REQUESTS MORE US ASSISTANCE 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  PA Minister of Agriculture Mahmoud 
al-Habbash told USAID Mission Director on July 23 that his 
ministry's efforts are focused on (1) land reclamation; (2) 
constructing roads for small farmers; and (3) developing 
water projects.  Abu Hassan requested additional funds for 
Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) programs, stressing that MOA 
strength is critical to WB/G agricultural development.  He 
said that the MOA in Gaza continues to report to his office 
in Ramallah.  End summary. 
 
Al-Habbash's Plan To 
Increase Production 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) USAID Mission Director and EconOff met on July 23 
with PA Minister of Agriculture Mahmoud al-Habbash to discuss 
USAID agricultural programs and the MOA's plan for the 
agricultural sector.  Al-Habbash said he is working to 
develop a clear strategy for Palestinian agricultural 
development that aims to increase production.  He said he 
plans to (1) begin programs of land reclamation (reviving 
soil to its earlier productive capacity); (2) construct roads 
to facilitate access to markets for small farmers; and (3) 
develop water projects throughout the West Bank and in Gaza, 
as current water resources are insufficient for desired 
growth in the agriculture sector. 
 
Lack Of Technology; 
Access and Movement 
------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Al-Habbash described two major obstacles to growth 
faced by Palestinian farmers: the lack of technology and 
limitations of access and movement.  He said that small-scale 
Palestinian farmers need more advanced farming techniques in 
water management and soil reclamation to develop their plots 
of land.  Al-Habbash said that the most obvious impediment to 
success in the agricultural sector is the Israeli closure 
regime, which seriously impedes access to markets. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Minister thanked USAID for its on-going 
programs in the private sector, such as the Palestinian 
Agribusiness Partnership Activity (PAPA) and its work to 
improve WB/G food production and quality, but requested 
additional support to the agriculture sector through the MOA. 
 The Minister asked that the US increase support to MOA in 
order to reduce poverty and subsequently increase security - 
key ingredients to "taking back Gaza from Hamas." 
 
MOA in Gaza 
----------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Al-Habbash noted that MOA Gaza offices continue to 
report to his office in Ramallah.  The MOA Director General 
of Planning and Policy said that MOA Gaza employees go to 
work and maintain certain programs to assist small farmers in 
Gaza.
