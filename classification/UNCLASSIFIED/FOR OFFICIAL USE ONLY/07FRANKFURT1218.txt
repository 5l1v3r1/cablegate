¶1. (SBU) On March 8, ConGen Frankfurt Pol-Econ officer and Pol-Econ 
specialist visited MSI Aircraft Maintenance Services International 
GmbH, located in Ruesselsheim (near Frankfurt) to conduct a Blue 
Lantern pre-license end-use check on application 050025683 (export 
of EC-135 helicopter spare parts to Germany).  Consulate 
representatives met with MSI owner/Managing Director Marga Blivier 
and toured the facility including storage and processing areas. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Marga Blivier (a former employee of Honeywell Grimes) 
purchased German distributor MSI in 1991.  MSI distributes aircraft 
parts (mostly lighting) and services some engines;  in addition, it 
will soon open an Airbus service station in Dubai.  Blivier 
explained its role in the transaction as follows:  as former 
distributor for Honeywell Grimes, MSI has done business with the 
German police since 2000;  although Honeywell now sells parts 
directly from the U.S., German police continue to use MSI as an 
intermediary to simplify processing.  About 30 percent of MSI's 
business is domestic (German police are its only government 
customers, with no military business);  non-German customers account 
for the bulk of its business.  MSI is expanding into airliner 
service in Dubai (and Germany), and is currently awaiting FAA 
approval as a certified repair station.  The Dubai office was 
created in response to an Airbus initiative to have A-380 repair 
capacity in close proximity to carrier Emirates (a large A-380 
customer). 
 
¶3. (SBU) The components in question are for the maintenance of the 
EC135 Helicopter;  according to the purchase order (which we saw), 
they are light bulbs and casings.  NOTE:  the application appears to 
combine two different orders: one for the Bavarian police and one 
for the German Border Police (Bundesgrenzschutz/ Bundespolizei), 
Mrs. Blivier provided the telephone numbers of both contact persons. 
 END NOTE. 
 
¶4. (SBU) MSI appears to be aware of export control restrictions and 
appears to maintain secure facilities and extensive records.  We 
requested and received documents relating to the orders in question; 
 those documents are stored for ten years.  The facility itself 
appeared secure and orderly, with an alarm system and controlled 
entry.  Access to the compound is restricted;  parts are locked. 
Blivier affirmed that the company follows technology controls and is 
aware of U.S. export control law;  it certified the end users for 
this order as it does for other transactions with controlled items. 
 
¶5. (SBU) ConGen Munich rep spoke via telephone to the Bavarian 
police helicopter squadron (Mr. Peter Hauschild) and to the Federal 
Border police (Mr. Reinhard Schmidt), both of whom confirmed placing 
recent orders with MSI.  Both confirmed they have done business with 
MSI for years and say they urgently need the spare parts under 
consideration in this order. 
 
¶6. (U) This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin and ConGen 
Munich.
