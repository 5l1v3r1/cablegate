SUBJECT: HUNGARIAN COMMENTS ON SEPTEMBER 15-16 GAERC 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 97574 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 96598 
 
¶1. (SBU) MFA EU External Relations and Crisis Situations 
Section Chief Andras Dekany discussed reftels with PolOff on 
September 12, and provided the following comments concerning 
the agenda items: 
 
¶2. (SBU) Zimbabwe 
 
- We are awaiting a clearer picture of the apparent agreement 
reached this week in Harare.  We will await to hear from 
those EU members who have more experience and closer ties to 
Africa. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Somalia 
 
- We support the establishment of the EUNAVCO coordination 
cell and the appointment of the Spanish Navy Captain to head 
EUNAVCO. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Serbia 
 
- We support the entry into force of the interim agreement - 
it serves the interests of Serbia and the EU - and we welcome 
the direct talks between Belgrade and Brussels. 
 
- We welcome the agreement between UNMIK and EULEX, however 
we see a problem in the handing over of competencies and 
tasks.  (Comment: Dekany provided no details as to specific 
tasks.  End comment.) 
 
- Deployment of the EULEX should cover all of Kosovo's 
territory.  It is very important for EULEX to cooperate with 
the local Kosovo-Serb leadership in the north, as the current 
political situation in Belgrade provides an opportunity to 
take advantage of those Kosovo-Serb leaders who are willing 
to discuss a future within Kosovo. 
 
- Belgrade asked for Hungarian support for their ICJ proposal 
on Kosovo during Foreign Minister Goncz's recent visit -- 
Goncz "remained noncommittal."  Hungary is interested in a 
common EU position on Serbia's ICJ initiative due to the 
"weight and complexity" of the issue. 
 
¶5. (U) Turkey 
 
- does not expect to be an agenda item 
 
¶6. (SBU) Georgia 
 
- We welcome the September 8 supplemental agreement and 
believe now is the time for the EU to show the political will 
to develop a forward-looking, comprehensive approach to the 
crisis as well as moving forward with their ESDP mission. 
 
- The October 1 ESDP target deployment date is important for 
EU credibility.  The ESDP mission must be autonomous to, but 
complementary with, other international organizations - the 
UN and OSCE missions - with tasks clearly delineated and 
coordinated.  Hungary submitted five law enforcement names 
for the ESDP mission and is awaiting nominations from their 
Security Services and Ministry of Defense for other 
candidates to serve with the mission. 
 
- Hungary has offered two candidates for the ESDP advance 
team mission - one to serve as the POLAD and a second person 
to serve as a logistics expert.
