¶1. (SBU) Leila Fethi, in charge of implementing programs in 
the Economic Control Division (ECD) in the Tunisian Ministry 
of Commerce and Handicrafts, discussed with EconOff the 
recent removal of pirated optical disks from retail giant 
Carrefour and upcoming GOT actions on the intellectual 
property front.  When asked whether Carrefour's decision to 
stop its sale of pirated optical disks (reftel) was in 
response to any particular GOT action, Fethi explained that 
the Ministry of Commerce had sent warning letters to 
Carrefour and other major retailers.  The letters delineated 
the laws being violated by each retailer and asked them to 
cease the sale of pirated goods.  Thus far, said Fethi, 
Carrefour is the only major retailer to abandon the sale of 
pirated goods.  Several other major retailers, such as Geant 
and Monoprix, have continued to stock pirated DVDs and CDs. 
Fethi stated that if Geant and Monoprix fail to cease sales 
on their own, the GOT will take the step of seizing the 
counterfeit products and destroying them.  When asked how 
much time remained for Geant and Monoprix to comply, Fethi 
indicated that the Ministry could be ready to take action as 
soon as January 2. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In addition, Fethi emphasized that IPR violations 
that impact health and safety are ECD's top priority, but 
that the division also considered the volume of goods 
involved.  Fethi also discussed an upcoming, but still 
unscheduled, GOT informational program on intellectual 
property rights.  She stated that the GOT was planning an 
informational fair that would travel the country to highlight 
both the short-term and long-term economic costs as well as 
the potential health and safety consequences of using 
counterfeit products. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: The indication that the Ministry of 
Commerce anticipates taking action against the offending 
retailers is welcome, though it remains to be seen whether 
other players in the public and private sector will support 
such a high profile action.  Post will continue to encourage 
tough GOT measures to protect intellectual property.  End 
Comment.
