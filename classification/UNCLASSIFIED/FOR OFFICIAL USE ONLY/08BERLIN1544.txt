SUBJECT: MERKEL OUTLINES GERMANY'S VISION FOR NATO: 
'NETWORKED SECURITY' 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY.  In a major speech in Berlin November 10, 
Chancellor Merkel promoted the German concept of "networked 
security," emphasizing that NATO's experience in Afghanistan 
showed that "security cannot be achieved by military means 
alone."  Merkel argued that the "networked security" approach 
should be a central part of NATO's new strategic concept.  In 
an apparent reference to Russian President Medvedev's recent 
European security architecture proposal, Merkel emphasized 
that it would not be possible to "drive a wedge" into the 
transatlantic partnership.  She emphasized, however, that 
NATO should have a "close and reliable" partnership with 
Russia.  While stressing that Georgia and Ukraine were not 
ready for NATO membership, she said that "we must map out a 
path that will lead us in this direction."  Merkel focused 
more than half of her speech on Afghanistan, calling it "the 
challenge" for NATO and hammering away at the need to fully 
implement the "networked security" approach.  END SUMMARY. 
 
FOCUS ON 'NETWORKED SECURITY' 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Chancellor Merkel opened the Annual Conference of 
the Atlantic Treaty Association in Berlin on November 10 with 
a major speech on challenges facing NATO and its role in the 
21st century, focusing particularly on Afghanistan (full text 
of speech e-mailed to NSC, EUR/CE, EUR/RPM and USNATO).  The 
Chancellery told post that the speech was probably the most 
significant foreign policy speech Merkel would deliver this 
fall.  In stressing the need for the April 2009 NATO Summit 
in Strasbourg/Kehl to task an update of the 1999 strategic 
concept, she strongly promoted the German concept of 
"networked security" (vernetzte Sicherheit), which emphasizes 
the need for military power to be accompanied by civilian 
resources and engagement to deal with 21st Century asymmetric 
threats.  Merkel argued that the NATO experience in 
Afghanistan showed that "security cannot be achieved by 
military means alone."  She said the key question to be 
addressed in the new strategic concept is the degree to which 
NATO is prepared to be a "political alliance" that considers 
"networked security to be one of its tasks."  Merkel argued 
that in such an Alliance, military action would always be 
conducted "in conjunction with development assistance, backed 
up by a political mandate, and on the basis of regulations 
extending far beyond military matters." 
 
CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH RUSSIA 
 
¶3. (U) Regarding Russia, Merkel indicated that the next NATO 
Summit should send a clear signal to Russia that "we want a 
close and reliable partnership with Russia to the maximum 
degree possible."  Merkel reiterated Germany's position that 
it is important for NATO to talk with Russia as a partner. 
"It is always better to talk to, rather than about, one 
another."  However, she repeated that NATO and the 
transatlantic relationship are the "strong cornerstone of our 
security architecture."  In an apparent reference to Russian 
President Medvedev's European security recent proposal, 
Merkel emphasized that it would not be possible to "drive a 
wedge" into the transatlantic partnership.  "Such attempts 
failed in the past and will also fail in the future." 
 
GEORGIA/UKRAINE 
 
¶4. (U) Merkel noted that the decision taken at the Bucharest 
Summit regarding the eventual NATO membership of Georgia and 
Ukraine "remains valid," but that neither country yet meets 
the conditions for NATO membership "given the current 
situation" in each.  She said she did not see this changing 
in the near future.  "Nevertheless, we must map out a path 
that will lead us in this direction."  She ruled out a 
Russian veto on membership, noting that "third parties are 
not entitled to determine who will and will not join NATO." 
 
AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶5. (U) Merkel focused more than half of her speech on 
Afghanistan, calling it "the challenge" for NATO and 
hammering away at the need to fully implement the "networked 
security" approach.  She rejected the need for a new 
strategy, arguing instead that the challenge was how to 
"translate the concept of networked security" into reality on 
the ground in Afghanistan.  She reminded the audience that 
NATO was in Afghanistan to ensure that it never again became 
a breeding ground for terrorists and that the mission was

supported by UNSC resolutions.  She cautioned against 
focusing solely on the number of deployed troops, stressing 
the need for police officers, aid workers and other civilian 
specialists as well.  She also emphasized the need for a 
comprehensive engagement by the entire international 
community. 
 
¶6. (U) She said the goal in Afghanistan was to establish 
self-sustaining structures, noting that building up the 
Afghan national security forces was "a special challenge for 
-- and priority of -- our engagement."  Merkel recognized 
NATO's successes, but stressed repeatedly the need for more 
engagement by the Afghan government, especially on difficult 
issues like counternarcotics.  "We cannot fight poppy 
cultivation if the Afghan actors do not strongly and bravely 
express themselves on this issue."  Finally, in a clear 
reference to the planned deployment of AWACS aircraft to 
Afghanistan, Merkel said that "progress must be made on 
aerial reconnaissance."
