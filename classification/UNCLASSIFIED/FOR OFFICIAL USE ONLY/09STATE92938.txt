SUBJECT: DEMARCHE: ACTIVITIES IN SOMALILAND AND PUNTLAND 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 2. 
 
OBJECTIVES 
---------- 
¶2. (SBU) Embassies Rome and Paris are asked to approach 
appropriate host government officials to collect information 
on their activities in the regions of Somaliland and Puntland 
in Somalia.  In particular, the Department is seeking 
information about host government activities in each region 
in the areas of development, humanitarian, and security 
assistance, and the level of host government political 
engagement with each region, as well as information on which 
host government embassy (whether in Kenya, Ethiopia or 
Djibouti) is primarily responsible for Somaliland and 
Puntland.  Please draw from the talking points in paragraph 3. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Posts may draw from the following talking points in 
approaching host governments: 
 
-- The United States supports the Djibouti Peace Process and 
the resulting Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 
Somalia.  The TFG represents the best chance for stability in 
Somalia that we have seen in many years.  It is the product 
of a Somali-led process that enjoys support from regional and 
international partners. 
 
-- The United States also remains engaged in Somaliland and 
Puntland, and we are focused on continuing assistance to both 
regions while simultaneously working to bolster and support 
the TFG. 
 
-- As we examine our engagement and assistance to both 
Somaliland and Puntland, we would be interested in hearing 
how you are engaging with both regions, including your 
current and future levels of development, humanitarian and 
security assistance, and how we can partner to achieve mutual 
goals of stability in Somaliland and Puntland.  We welcome 
discussion on your plans for supporting all regions of 
Somalia as the country struggles to overcome its troubled 
history and retake its place among the family of nations. 
 
-- The United States remains minimally engaged in Somaliland 
and Puntland, and we are focused on continuing and expanding 
our assistance to both semi-autonomous regions while 
simultaneously working to bolster and support the TFG.  While 
U.S. diplomatic representation on Somalia is seated within 
the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, our embassies in Djibouti and 
Addis regularly engage with TFG, Somaliland and Puntland 
officials and contacts. 
 
REPORTING DEADLINE
