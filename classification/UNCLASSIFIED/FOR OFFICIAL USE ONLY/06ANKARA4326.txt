SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
¶1. (U) This is an urgent action request -- please see para. 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Over 700 of the approximately 1700 American citizens 
and their dependents evacuated from Turkey to Lebanon on July 
23 remain at Incirlik Air Base.  Schedules for commercial 
charter flights from Incirlik to CONUS have come and gone, 
with flights promised for July 24, 25, 26, and 27 (today), 
only four of which have actually materialized. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Our evacuees are increasingly anxious to get to the 
United States.  Nerves are frayed, and anger is on the 
increase enough to become a public relations concern.  Amcits 
and their dependents are physically comfortable at Incirlik; 
from what we understand, conditions there are better than at 
the Nicosia fairgrounds.  Their quarters, Incirlik's Patriot 
Village, are air-conditioned, the base has set up facilities 
to call home and use the Internet, and the evacuees are 
getting good food and medical care.  But unless we get firm 
flights July 27 or 28, we will have problems. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action Request: Request the Department redouble its 
efforts urgently to provide reliable commercial aircraft 
immediately for this evacuation, or consider requesting 
milair assets, as were used for Cyprus.
