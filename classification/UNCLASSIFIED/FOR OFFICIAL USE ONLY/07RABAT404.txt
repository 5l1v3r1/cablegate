¶2.  (SBU)  A salute of 21 cannon shots boomed across Rabat 
from El Mechouar Palace shortly after 8 p.m. on February 28 
to announce the birth of the king's second child, Princess 
Lalla Khadija.  Naming the baby Khadija, the name of the 
Prophet Mohammed's first wife, links the new princess to 
Islam and to her lineage as a descendant of the prophet.  The 
nine-member medical team consisted of six Moroccans, one 
American, and two Frenchmen.  The princess weighed 4.16 kg 
(about 8 punds) and measured 49 cm. (about 23 inches); and, 
her mother, Princess Lalla Salma, and she were in good 
health, according to the official announcement. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Celebrations started almost immediately in many 
streets and people assembled by the palace.  Folklore groups 
and music bands continued chanting and dancing through the 
night.  The King and his brother, Moulay Rachid, greeted the 
crowd in front of El Mechouar Palace before welcoming 
journalists and broadcast media to take pictures of the 
newborn princess. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The Royal Household, Protocol and Chancellery 
announced the princess's birth on RTM and 2M television 
stations shortly after 8 p.m.  The public was told that 
"Visitors Books" are available at the royal palace, in the 
prefectures and at Moroccan embassies abroad for those 
wishing to congratulate the monarch and the royal family. 
The Ambassador expects to sign. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The country expected Lalla Salma to give birth 
February 15.  When the baby was overdue, rumors flew around 
the country.  Some said the baby was a boy, others that it 
was a girl.  As the days passed, the rumors were embellished: 
 the baby had been born impaired or that the baby was 
stillborn.  Before Princess Lalla Khadija's birth, the Royal 
Household, Protocol and Chancellery reassured Moroccans that 
Princess Lalla Salma was in good health and that they would 
be informed when the baby was born.  The opacity and 
surrounding speculation are characteristic of palace 
activities.
