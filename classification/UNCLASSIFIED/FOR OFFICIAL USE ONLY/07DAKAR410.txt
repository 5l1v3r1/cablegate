¶1.  (U) The Ambassador convened the EAC on February 22, 2007, to 
review our security posture in light of election violence that broke 
out on the evening of February 21, 2007. 
 
¶2.  (U) According to a variety of sources, supporters of President 
Abdoulaye Wade clashed with supporters of opposition candidate 
Idrissa Seck in the Fenetre-Mermoz neighborhood at approximately 
2000 hrs.  A number of persons were injured, vehicles destroyed, and 
a popular local restaurant ransacked.  Two embassy employees were 
eating in the restaurant at the time of the clash, and the 
restaurant is within a mile of approximately 20 embassy residences. 
The two embassy personnel escaped the scene without injury. 
 
¶3.  (U) While post conducted a number of pre-election security 
preparations (see refs), the consensus of the EAC is that potential 
for continued political violence remains high through the remainder 
of the campaign period, election day on Sunday, February 25, and 
throughout the next week when results are expected to be announced. 
The consensus of the EAC was that the potential for violent 
political clashes is particularly high in the afternoon following 
mid-day prayer. 
 
¶4.  (U) The consensus of the EAC was that the following additional 
precautions should be taken to limit the exposure of embassy 
personnel random acts of political violence: 
 
(a) Cancel the evening public film program at the Mbacke Annex for 
February 22 and 23; 
 
(b) Postpone a CLO-organized excursion outside the city that was 
scheduled for Saturday, February 24; 
 
(c) Require all embassy personnel to monitor their radios when 
traveling outside their residences to ensure they remain updated 
regarding the local security situation; and 
 
(d) Recommend that employees and families limit un-necessary travel 
outside their residences after 14:00. 
 
¶5.  (U) The EAC recommended language for a public announcement to be 
issued by the Department.  CA cleared the language which has been 
distributed as a warden message, pending issuance of a public 
announcement. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The Embassy issued the following press release, which has 
received extensive, favorable coverage in local media as well as a 
strong negative reaction from the GOS (Septel). 
 
BEGIN TEXT. 
 
The U.S. Embassy condemns recent election violence in Senegal.  The 
Embassy deeply regrets last night's election-related violence, which 
caused serious injury to persons and property and posed a 
significant threat to Dakar residents, including Americans.  We call 
upon all parties to respect the safety and right of passage of all 
citizens and to ensure a peaceful election process in Senegal. 
 
END TEXT. 
 
¶7.  (U) Dakar's EAC will continue to monitor the local situation, 
maintain liaison with host-government police and security officials, 
and reconvene as appropriate.  At present, plans to deploy 14 
embassy sponsored election observer teams on Sunday, February 25, 
remain in place.  RSO will conduct a special security briefing will 
all teams prior to their departure.
