RESOLUTION 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Morocco Ministry of Foreign Affairs Head of the 
United Nations and International Organizations Directorate 
Azzedine Farhane met with Poloff today and said that Morocco 
would like to jointly sponsor, with the United States and 
Russia, a United Nations (UN) 1st Committee resolution to 
promote the Global Initiative To Combat Nuclear Terrorism 
(GICNT). This offer comes on the heels of a successful 
Moroccan-hosted GICNT Conference in Rabat last week. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Farhane said when he met with Russian Ambassador to 
Morocco Boris Bolotine this morning, he received a favorable 
response on the proposal from Bolotine.  Morocco will not 
take action on this issue before U.S. and Russian concurrence. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Farhane suggested that Morocco could discuss this 
matter in more detail next week with the U.S. and Russia 
delegations attending the GICNT Plenary Session at The Hague. 
 Underscoring its importance to Morocco, Farhane requested 
that the U.S. provide an initial response to Morocco's 
proposal tomorrow, June 12, if at all possible.  Post would 
appreciate Department's timely response to this inquiry.
