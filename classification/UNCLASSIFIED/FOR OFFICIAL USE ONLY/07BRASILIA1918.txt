¶1.  (U) THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED AND NOT FOR 
INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  On September 24, 2007 leaders from eleven 
Tropical Rainforest Countries (the Forest 11) issued a joint 
statement calling for, inter alia, cooperation to slow, stop and 
reverse deforestation and for greater international recognition of 
these efforts as a means to combat climate change.  On its face, the 
statement appears to indicate a unified stance among the Forest 11 
with an eye toward the upcoming United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) talks in Bali.  However, while the Forest 
11 states appear to share a common view that a global scheme to 
address deforestation should be part of any discussions aimed at 
combating global climate change, the group has not reached a 
consensus on what such a scheme would entail does not exist.  The 
GOB is at least one participant in the Forest 11 that holds 
diverging views with some of the other participants.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On October 4, 2007, ESTH Officer contacted Paulo Jose 
Chiarelli, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Exterior Relations' 
(MRE) Division for Environmental Policy and Sustainable Development, 
to discuss the Forest 11 initiative and to learn more about the 
Government of Brazil's (GOB) role as a participant.  According to 
Chiarelli, the GOB agreed to support the Indonesian initiated Forest 
11 joint statement [along with Cameroon, Colombia, Congo, Costa 
Rica, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Indonesia, Malaysia, 
Papua New Guinea, and Peru] at the eleventh hour.  It was not 
particularly difficult for the GOB to join the group, especially due 
to the decision among participant governments to highlight their 
similarities, rather than to debate differences and details.  In 
this regard, he emphasized that to the GOB the statement definitely 
is not a "coalition" or a group aiming to table a specific proposal 
in the upcoming meeting of the UN Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) in Bali in December and beyond.  Chiarelli said the 
GOB considers the statement to be a non-binding political statement 
and not one meant to be a mandate or common negotiating roadmap. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) To this end, Chiarelli explained that by signing the 
statement, the GOB wanted to accomplish at least two goals:  1) show 
support for Indonesia during its UNFCCC COP 13 Presidency, and; 2) 
ensure that compensated deforestation reduction as a means to combat 
climate change is adequately credited under a global climate change 
framework and addressed in a way that fosters economic development. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The GOB does not, Chiarelli emphasized, agree with the 
entirety of the Forest 11 statement on the strategies and mechanisms 
for achieving this latter goal.  For example, he said that Costa 
Rica's desire to include a cap and trade market system in 
deforestation reduction efforts is not acceptable to the GOB at this 
time. (Note: the GOB has made its position clear in this regard in 
the past and more recently by not participating in deforestation 
reduction talks among Latin American countries held in Santiago, 
Chile in August, 2007. End note).  The GOB would similarly disagree 
with other countries that are in line with Costa Rica.  Instead, the 
GOB continues to tout its purely voluntary compensated deforestation 
reduction proposal and continues to refine its details (reftel). 
While it does support new funding for these efforts, Chiarelli 
pointed out that the GOB refers to this new funding as "mechanisms" 
or "positive incentives" and does not necessarily support the 
creation of a new international fund. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) COMMENT.  The GOB's participation in the Forest 11 joint 
statement is generally in line with its view to obtain financial 
incentives for reducing the rate of deforestation.  In this regard 
the Forest 11 appears to share a common perspective.  However, the 
GOB believes that to assure continued economic development these 
efforts should be voluntary and free of market intrusions, and its 
inability to convince at least some of the Forest 11 that the GOB 
proposal is paramount also appears to show that it is not likely 
that the Forest 11 will come to Bali with a common approach to 
reducing deforestation as a means to combat climate change.  END 
COMMENT.
