On December 8, Economic Minister-Counselor passed the 
information in Ref A on the five individuals that Treasury 
designated under EO 13224 as terrorist facilitators and 
inciters to Yves Beaulieu, Deputy Director, Counter-Terrorism 
Division, Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT).  Thanks to the November 15 heads-up the 
Embassy gave to DFAIT on the U.S. intention to submit the 
names of the five individuals to the UN 1267 Sanctions 
Committee (Refs B and C), Canada's Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions has prepared the 
necessary notice to banks to add the names to Canada's list 
of terrorist individuals.  The notice will be sent out as 
soon as the GoC receives confirmation from the Canadian UN 
Mission that the names have been approved for inclusion on 
the consolidated UN list of individuals and entities 
associated with Osama bin Ladin, al-Qaida, and the Taliban. 
Beaulieu praised the USG advance notice, explaining that this 
greatly facilitates the ability of Canada's bureaucracy to 
move extremely quickly to notify the financial institutions 
throughout the country once the UN acts.
