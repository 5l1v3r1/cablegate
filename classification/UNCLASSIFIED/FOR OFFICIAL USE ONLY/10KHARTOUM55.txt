¶1. (SBU) Summary: Chadian rebel troops have allegedly looted markets 
in nearly a dozen villages near the area of Al Saiyah in North 
Darfur, according to local media and Sudanese rebel sources. 
However, no independent verification is available.  A  United 
Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) patrol team sent on 
January 4 to investigate allegations of rape and looting in the 
village of Kulukulo was stopped by Chadian rebels on the outskirts 
of the village and forced to return back to its base. It is unclear 
at this time when another patrol will be attempted. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Chadian rebels near Al Saiyah have been wreaking havoc on 
the area, according to local media and Sudanese rebel sources. On 
January 6, Ray-Al-Shaab newspaper reported that Chadian rebels had 
looted the market in Al Saiyah, and continued on to raid the 
neighboring villages of Goz Leben, Um Haglig, Tacoz and Um Leona. 
They reportedly then headed East and raided the villages of Koskare, 
Gos Dogu ad Zurug, where they are said to have clashed with local 
camel herders. Suleiman Marajan, an SLA/AW-affiliated rebel 
commander who controls territory nearby, told emboff the Chadian 
rebels had also attacked villages north of Al Saiyah, including 
Daragna, Kedrin and Allagartha (phonetic). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Marajan said that the Al Saiyah area has very limited 
resources, which do not even satisfy the needs of the local 
population, prompting the Chadian rebels to travel to surrounding 
villages. Rapes of local women by Chadian rebels are also becoming 
common, he said. (Note: a UNAMID Human Rights officer told poloff 
that nine women had been raped by Chadian rebels in the village of 
Kulukulo on December 27. End Note.) Local media reported that the 
leader of the Berti tribe indigenous to the area appealed to the 
Wali (Governor) of North Darfur--himself a member of the Berti 
tribe--to deal with these criminal acts. The Wali allegedly told him 
that he could do nothing as the decision to relocate the Chadians to 
the area had originated with the Government of Sudan (GOS) in 
Khartoum. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On January 4, a UNAMID team on patrol to Kulukulo village 
was stopped about one kilometer from the village by Chadian rebel 
troops. The Chadian rebel commander informed UNAMID that the patrol 
would have to be accompanied by GOS soldiers before rebels would 
allow it to proceed to the village.  However, GOS military in the 
locality had earlier indicated to UNAMID they were unwilling to 
assist the patrol, according to UN sources. The patrol team 
therefore aborted the mission. It is unclear whether another patrol 
will be attempted. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: While the cantonment of Chadian rebels in North 
Darfur is an important confidence-building measure in the 
normalization of Chad-Sudan relations, their alleged criminal 
behavior threatens to further destabilize an already unpredictable 
security situation. With the EU-led discussions with Chadian rebel 
alliance Union of Resistance Forces (UFR) seemingly at a standstill, 
only the GOS appears to be in a position to stop Chadian rebels from 
looting and raping in North Darfur, if these allegations, in fact, 
turn out to be true.
