¶1. (SBU) Summary: Chadian rebels test-fired newly received heavy 
weapons outside the area of Mellit on January 22, according to both 
UN and rebel sources. No details have emerged where the weapons 
came from. The incident comes less than two weeks after Chad and 
Sudan signed agreements to end all support for armed rebel groups 
in their territories. The security situation in Mellit is otherwise 
reported to be calm. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 22, UNAMID reported that at approximately 
10:15am, there was heavy firing of weapons west of Mellit 
(approximately 65 kilometers north of El Fasher). A UNAMID patrol 
team seeking to investigate interacted with a local GOS military 
commander, who told the patrol that the Chadian rebels had received 
new heavy weapons and had been granted permission by the GOS to 
test-fire them outside of Mellit. It remains unclear where the 
weapons came from, though one UN Officer told poloff that he 
believed they were provided by the GOS. "In my opinion, that's the 
only way they could have got them," he said. 
 
¶3. (SBU) SLA/AW Commander Suleiman Marajan, who maintains a 
presence north of Mellit, told emboff that Chadian rebels had been 
test-firing heavy weaponry northwest of Mellit for several days 
beginning on January 20, terrifying local villagers in the process. 
He alleged that the weapons included 106mm mortars and 107mm 
multi-barrel rocket launchers, which he claimed were supplied by 
the GOS. He did not speculate on whether the Chadian rebels would 
remain in Mellit or where they would use their newly acquired 
firepower. 
 
¶4. (SBU) UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) Officer told 
poloff on January 23 that most Chadian rebels have since moved out 
of Mellit town in a southward direction. Their exact location is 
unknown, but rumors are circulating that they are heading west 
towards Northern Kordofan, he said. He further predicted that 
trouble would follow wherever they go, noting that "anywhere they 
set foot, they rape, pillage and cause mayhem...  I seriously think 
that any attempt by the GOS to demobilize them would end in a 
fight." 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: How the GOS handles the Chadian rebels in Sudan 
will test its sincerity and ability to implement January 15 
Ndjamena Agreement (reftels), especially following the reported 
rearmament of the Chadian rebels. A lack of coordination between 
Khartoum politicians and local elements of the GOS military and 
security apparatus may be to blame, or possibly the Chadians 
acquired the weapons from some source other than the GOS. The 
prospects for disarmament and demobilization of the rebel force are 
uncertain, however, and one cannot ignore Chad and Sudan's history 
of past failed agreements.
