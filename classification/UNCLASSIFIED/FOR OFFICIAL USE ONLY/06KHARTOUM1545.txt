HOPE FOR OPENING TO U.S. (CORRECTION, ADDRESSEES) 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 01477 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  At a chance meeting in Khartoum on June 
24, Somali delegates of the Islamic Courts movement asked 
Emboff to convey their views to the U.S. Government. They 
argued that, despite perceived U.S. hostility, they were not 
anti-American, and actually wanted, above all, to open 
contact with the USG.  They expressed appreciation for U.S. 
support for the Khartoum-brokered ceasefire, and hopes that 
the U.S. would be officially involved when they return for 
further talks in mid-July.  Denying terrorist links, they 
repeatedly asked for a U.S./Western fact-finding mission to 
come to Mogadishu to verify the situation there.  One 
delegation members said they were ready "to forgive and 
forget."  They are "crying for help," another said.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
Union of Islamic Courts Delegates Seek USG Contact 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy officer was seated with a Somali-American 
friend, businessman Ali Aden, on June 24 at the Hilton 
Hotel, when they were joined by several members of the 
Somali Islamic Courts delegation to the Arab League talks 
then concluded in Khartoum.  They said they wished to make 
their views known to an American official. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Courts delegation members present were: 
delegation leader, Prof. Mohamed Ali Ibrahim; Dahir Mohamed 
Ghelle, said to work in the Somali radio; Ali Addalla Toyo; 
and Omar Aden Mohamed Ghadi, British-educated and 
Westernized in manner, said to specialize in foreign 
contacts for the group. 
 
14 Failed Conferences Later, UIC Builds Popular Support 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Head of delegation, Mohamed Ali Ibrahim, 
emphasized the Courts' security concerns. For the past 15 
years, he said, they have been torn by violent inter- 
factional conflicts; they have had 14 national conferences, 
all of which failed.  The Interim Government that issued 
from the Nairobi Conference is warlord-controlled but very 
weak, he said, controlling only a small territory.  The 
Islamic Courts, in contrast, are a traditional institution, 
focused on law and order, and have won widespread popular 
support. 
 
UIC Seeks to Cooperate with USG, Restore Stability 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The current warlord coalition claims U.S. support, 
Ibrahim said, in an alliance against alleged terrorists in 
Mogadishu, which has been bombarded.  To fight terrorism, 
however, there is a need for government, courts, security. 
That, he said, is their concern.  They want to restore the 
education and health facilities that have been destroyed, 
disarm militias, and combat piracy and trafficking.  They 
are "ready to cooperate with the U.S. and other countries." 
They hope that potential foreign partners will change their 
minds. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ibrahim said they had had no other contacts with 
U.S. officials, apart from sending several letters that have 
gone unanswered.  They have heard of the U.S. expression of 
support for the Khartoum ceasefire agreement, and are "very 
grateful" for that.  There is a follow-up meeting here on 
July 15.  The U.S. has backed creation of a Contact Group, 
and they appreciate this initiative.  They are looking for 
U.S. signals that it wants direct contact - they hope for 
this. 
 
UIC Hopes Khartoum Talks Lead to New Government 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶7. (SBU) This theme was strongly echoed by Omar Aden Mohamed 
Ghadi, after the other three delegates withdrew.  The 
delegation had met with many embassies in Khartoum, he said, 
including the German ambassador, and the Courts delegates 
had repeatedly asked to be put in touch with the U.S.  They 
expect the July 15 meeting to give rise to a new government, 
perhaps incorporating a few persons from the current 
Transitional Government.  It will be a pivotal time, when 
the U.S. should be present and play a guiding role.  They 
really want the Americans to be there, he said. 
 
 
¶8. (SBU) The two other members of the group, Ali Addalla 
 
KHARTOUM 00001545  002 OF 002 
 
 
Toyo and especially Dahir Mohamed Ghelle, seemed more 
guarded.  Both noted more negative feelings towards the U.S. 
in Somali in recent years, with Ghelle pointing to the 
suffering caused by U.S. restrictions on informal money 
transfers (barakat) and various Islamic charities, and by 
U.S. support for the warlords.  At the same time, when the 
U.S. restrained Ethiopia from attacking recently, crowds 
"demonstrated in favor of Bush."   It is "time for a new 
U.S. policy," Ghelle said.  On their side, they "can forgive 
and forget." 
 
USG Should Come to Mogadishu and See Situation First-Hand 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶9. (SBU) Toyo acknowledged and appealed to American 
principles of justice and rights.  If the U.S. has 
suspicions of terrorism, they should come to Mogadishu and 
inspect.  If U.S. money could be put to investigations and 
to cooperation instead of to arms, it could solve the 
situation there, he said.  They hope for a breakthrough in 
relations with the U.S. because of this contact tonight.
