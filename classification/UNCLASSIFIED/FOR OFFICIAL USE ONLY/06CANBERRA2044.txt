¶1.  (U) In a media statement released December 24, Australian 
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer affirmed that Australia 
would proceed to implement sanctions on Iran's nuclear and 
missile programs, in accordance with the terms of UN Security 
Council Resolution 1737.  He noted specifically the 
requirement to ban assistance and trade related to Iran's 
uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities, and ballistic 
missile program, as well as travel notification and asset 
freeze measures of individuals and entities providing 
proliferation-related support.  Full text of the statement is 
at para 3, below. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We also furnished reftel non-paper to Octavia 
Borthwick, Director of the Middle East Section, Department of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade, on December 28.  Borthwick 
appreciated hearing U.S. views on UNSCR 1737, noting they 
closely paralleled Australian views.  She referred us to FM 
Downer's earlier statement, and reiterated that Australia 
endorsed fully the UNSC action.  She expressed confidence 
that Australia would be able to meet the 60-day reporting 
requirement (in OP 19 of the resolution) on its progress in 
implementing the terms of the resolution. 
 
¶3. (U) Following is the text of Foreign Minister Downer's 
December 24 media statement on UNSCR 1737. 
 
Begin text: 
 
Australia to Implement UN Security Council Resolution on Iran 
 
The unanimous adoption by the UN Security Council on 23 
December 2006 of a firm resolution imposing sanctions on 
Iran's nuclear and missile programs underscores the 
international community's commitment to addressing concerns 
about Iran's nuclear activities. 
 
The adoption of resolution 1737 follows Iran's failure to 
comply with Security Council Resolution 1696 which made 
mandatory the suspension of all Iran's uranium enrichment and 
reprocessing activities. 
 
Australia will now be proceeding to implement the terms of 
the resolution.  These include a ban on the provision of 
assistance and the sale, transfer or procurement of certain 
military and dual-use items related to Iran's uranium 
enrichment and reprocessing activities, and ballistic missile 
program.  Resolution 1737 also places measures in relation to 
travel and an assets freeze on persons or entities designated 
by the Security Council as providing support to proliferation 
sensitive nuclear activities and the development of nuclear 
weapon delivery systems. 
 
All UN member states are obliged to implement the sanctions 
imposed by the United Nations Security Council.  At the same 
time, all sanctions contained in resolution 1737 are 
reversible should Iran suspend its uranium enrichment and 
reprocessing activities. 
 
Australia fully endorses the Security Council conviction that 
Iran's suspension of all uranium enrichment and reprocessing 
activities as well as full, verified compliance with the 
requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
Board of Governors will contribute to a diplomatic, 
negotiated solution. 
 
As I have said previously, this is not a case of questioning 
Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy.  Australia supports 
the right of all parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty that comply faithfully with their non-proliferation 
commitments to peaceful nuclear energy. 
 
The onus is now on Iran as a responsible member of the United 
Nations to abide by all Security Council decisions and 
cooperate fully with the IAEA to prove without doubt that its 
nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes.
