¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Drawing on reftel points, poloff urged 
Indonesian support for the draft resolution related to UNSCR 
1267 concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban.  In comments echoed 
by other GOI officials, Mission contact said Indonesia would 
continue to review the draft resolution, but had some 
concerns about transparency and "due process" regarding what 
persons or entities deserve listing.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On June 24, poloff met Aris Munandar, Deputy 
Director for Terrorism at the Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DEPLU).  Poloff reviewed the draft resolution re UNSCR 1267 
containing improvements to its sanctions regime and an 
extension in the mandate of the 1267 Monitoring Team.  Poloff 
provided information on the proposed mandate renewal, and the 
USG's intention to work with Indonesia and other countries 
concerned with the listing and delisting process.  Poloff 
urged the GOI to support the draft resolution. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In comments echoed by other GOI officials, Munandar 
said the Indonesian government respected the work of the 1267 
Committee but had problems with the listing process.  He 
reiterated Indonesian concerns that the procedures involved 
were not transparent and lacked "due process" for the 
organizations and individuals proposed for listing.  Further, 
Indonesia believed it was necessary to consider 
"humanitarian" aspects of the listings when deciding on next 
steps.  Munandar said Indonesia had been discussing these 
concerns with other member-states, particularly from the 
European Union. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Poloff stressed that the U.S. was committed to 
working with Indonesia to create a listing process that would 
make it easier for member countries to enforce in a 
transparent, fair manner future listing and delistings. 
Munandar said the GOI understood this, and would continue to 
discuss the matter internally and in New York.
