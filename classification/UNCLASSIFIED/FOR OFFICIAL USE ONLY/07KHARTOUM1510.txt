MSA THREATS REMAIN 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
JEM REP DISCUSSES SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES BUT ALSO MSA 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Force Commander Martin Luther Agwai chaired meetings of 
both chambers and pushed to reduce each chamber to one formal 
meeting per week.  No report on the Kalma IDP incursion has yet been 
received from the sector, nor have any AMIS officials been able to 
investigate the Haskanita fighting.  Justice and Equality Movement 
(JEM) Representative Gen. Bashir claimed on 17 September that air 
strikes were continuing in Haskanita (Note:  There is no 
corroboration of that claim in any AMIS military sitreps or daily 
briefings.  End note.)  Bashir also complained that AMIS had not 
followed through on several old weapons seizures and road traffic 
accident (RTA) compensation cases and threatened that JEM might 
leave the CFC. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Agwai admitted he was not aware of the old weapons seizure 
and RTA compensation cases.  He noted that the Second Chamber was 
created in response to Sudan Liberation Army (SLA)/Non-Signatory 
Faction (NSF) complaints that they were not represented on the 
CFC--the CFC did not request their representatives to attend nor 
imply any treatment equal to other observers.  He also blamed JEM, 
not just the Government, for the delay in the Haskanita 
investigation, as the JEM had threatened to shoot down AMIS 
helicopters in the area. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
SE NATSIOS' COMMENTS BROUGHT UP AS ILLUSTRATIVE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶3. (SBU) In the First Chamber meeting, Agwai distributed copies of 
the September 13 Brussels RFI interview with Special Envoy Natsios. 
Field Off noted that the article was not an attack against the CFC 
chairman and members, but a criticism of the CFC's systemic 
weaknesses and that SE Natsios shared concerns about the Haskanita 
violence.  Most members concurred, although the Sudanese Government 
representative complained that Sudan rather than the rebel factions 
is often blamed for violations. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
AMIS CONCERNED ABOUT SLA/MM MSA SPILLOVER EFFECTS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The AMIS Mil Sitrep and briefing covering 18 Sep recorded 
four separate incidents in Sector 1 (in which El Fasher is located) 
where AMIS patrols were queried about MSA, or, indirectly as a 
result, warned not to proceed without SLA/M representatives present. 
 At the end of the 19 September AMIS staff meeting, the Chief of 
Staff warned that he feared more car-jackings were likely as a 
result.  He noted the factions' continued frustration over the MSA 
reduction, plus the transfer from AMIS to UNAMID.
