SUBJECT: CUBA ON DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE IN CARIBBEAN 
 
 
¶1. (U) Cuba's Ambassador to Guyana and CARICOM, Alejandro 
Marchante Castellanos, presented his credentials to 
CARICOM SYG Edwin Carrington March 10.  In his remarks, 
Castellanos said that Cuba planned to establish four new 
diplomatic missions in Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname as it seeks to 
strengthen relations with individual CARICOM nations. 
These missions would give Cuba a diplomatic presence in 
all fifteen CARICOM member states. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Cuba's diplomatic overture is in part 
an attempt to corner, or at least neutralize, CARICOM 
votes in international fora.  Note: CARICOM tries in the 
first instance to reach consensus and vote as a bloc on 
multilateral issues.  While letting Cuba cozy up to them, 
CARICOM nations repeatedly pass up opportunities to take 
Cuba to task - at a minimum for its treatment of 
political dissidents.  The quid pro quo is simple.  As 
Guyana's President Jagdeo once explained to Ambassador, 
Guyana (and other CARICOM nations) avoid criticizing Cuba 
because Cuba sends doctors and doles out scholarships. 
End comment.
