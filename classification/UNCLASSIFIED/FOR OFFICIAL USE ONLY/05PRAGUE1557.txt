Stasek, director of Middle East and Africa Department in the 
Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Stasek agreed that the 
Iraqi referendum was a positive step toward a democratic

to disagree within the framework of a political process. 
Czech Minster of Foreign Affairs Cyril Svoboda also issued a 
statement on October 26.  He said that the recent acceptance 
of the constitution, as well as the upcoming Parliamentary 
vote in December, are important steps toward creating an 
Iraqi government based upon the principle of democracy, 
creating a safe environment for all Iraqi citizens and 
economic reconstruction of the country. He added that the 
Czech Republic would do everying within in its means to help 
Iraq on the road to democracy, stability and economic 
prosperity.
