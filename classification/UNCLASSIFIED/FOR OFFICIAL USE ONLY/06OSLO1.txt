¶1.  (SBU) On December 30 Acting Political/Economic Chief 
delivered reftel points regarding USG concerns about Norsk 
Hydro's oil discovery in Iran's Anaran Field and its deal for 
the Khorramabad block to Norwegian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Energy Advisor Ambassador Janne Julsrud and to Norsk 
Hydro Company Secretary/Legal Counsel Benedikte Bjorn. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Julsrud said that Norway was fully aware of ILSA's 
provisions and their implications for Hydro's activities in 
Iran.  The Norwegian government engaged in a continuous 
dialogue with both major Norwegian petroleum firms, Statoil 
and Norsk Hydro, about their operations in Iran.  As part of 
that dialogue, said Julsrud, the government advises the firms 
to exercise caution in their business dealings there and to 
take care not to run afoul of ILSA.  The Norwegian government 
shared many of our concerns about Iran's policies and human 
rights record, though not to such an extent that it would 
advise Norwegian firms to pull out. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Hydro Counsel Bjorn offered no substantive comment 
on the demarche points but pledged to inform appropriate 
Hydro executives, most of whom were either out of the country 
on business or away for the holidays.  Bjorn hoped Hydro 
could give a fuller response sometime after New Years once 
she had consulted with other company officers.
