IRANIAN-PAKISTANI SHIPPING LINE

¶1.  (SBU)  This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 
three. 
 
------------------ 
SUMMARY/BACKGROUND 
------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Recent press reports suggest that Pakistan is 
considering the establishment of a joint shipping line with 
Iran to boost maritime cooperation and trade.  Due to recent 
public exposure of Iran,s use of its primary shipping line, 
the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line (IRISL), for 
proliferation activities, it would make sense for Iran to 
work around the increased scrutiny of IRISL by using its 
other shipping lines for proliferation-related shipments. 
For this reason, Washington strongly urges Pakistan to end 
any discussions with Iran on a joint shipping line, as Iran 
may now use other shipping lines for proliferation activities. 
 
------------------------- 
OBJECTIVES/ACTION REQUEST 
------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Washington requests Embassy Islamabad approach 
appropriate Pakistani officials in the foreign affairs and 
finance ministries, and other appropriate government 
agencies, including those responsible for shipping and 
customs activities, to discuss this issue.  Post should 
pursue the following objectives, and may draw from the 
information in REFTELs on the designation of IRISL and its 
subsidiaries. 
 
-- Inform Pakistan of Iran,s established history of using 
its primary shipping line, the Islamic Republic of Iran 
Shipping Line (IRISL), for proliferation-related purposes 
(REF B, C). 
 
-- Note that IRISL was specifically mentioned in operative 
paragraph 11 of UNSCR 1803 (REFTEL), which called upon 
States, in accordance with national legal authorities and 
consistant with international law, to inspect the cargoes 
going to or from Iran, of aircraft and vessels, at their 
airports and seaports, owned or operated by Iran Air Cargo 
and IRISL, provided there are reasonable grounds to believe 
that the aircraft or vessel is transporting goods prohibited 
under UNSCR 1803 and UNSCRs 1737 and 1747. 
 
-- Inquire whether IRISL or any subsidiaries or affiliates of 
IRISL are involved in the proposed joint venture. 
 
-- Advise Pakistan that any Pakistani joint venture with 
IRISL or any other UNSCR-designated entity could subject 
those entities involved with such joint ventures to 
designation under E.O. 13382 (REF A).  (Note: Six of IRISL,s 
joint ventures designated under E.O. 13382 on September 10, 
2008 are in countries outside of Iran. End note.) 
 
-- Convey that as international scrutiny of IRISL has 
increased, there is a likelihood that Iran may use its other 
shipping lines for its proliferation activities.  Pakistan 
does not want to provide Iran with an additional means to 
facilitate proliferation. 
 
-- Urge Pakistan to end discussions with Iran to establish a 
joint shipping company and to reconsider expanding trade ties 
with Iran.
