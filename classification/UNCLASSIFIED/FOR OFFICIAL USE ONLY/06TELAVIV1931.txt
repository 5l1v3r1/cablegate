SUBJECT: STATUS OF ANTI-TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Minister of Justice Haim Ramon told Ambassador 
Jones May 17 that he will make the draft anti-trafficking 
bill "the first priority legislation" of the new government, 
setting it on a track that, under optimum conditions, will 
achieve final passage within two months.  Ramon said that he 
will chair the May 21 government legislative committee 
meeting that will decide which bills from the former Knesset 
advance to the new Knesset under the "law on legislative 
continuity."  Ramon said that he will ensure that the 
committee sends the anti-trafficking bill to the Knesset May 
22 for a vote the minimum two weeks later on the bill's 
continuity status.  Once MKs have approved the bill's 
continuity status, Ramon said, the bill will then go to the 
Constitution and Law Committee in preparation for its second 
and third readings.  Ramon pledged that the Kadima-led 
Constitution and Law Committee will ensure that the bill 
proceeds at the fastest possible pace. 
 
¶2.  (U) NOTE: For a bill from a former Knesset to continue 
forward under the law of continuity, a simple majority of the 
new Knesset must vote to approve its continuity status.  The 
vote to approve a bill's continuity status cannot take place 
less than two weeks from the date of its submission to the 
Knesset, in this case from May 22.  During that two-week 
period, MKs can register any objections to the bill's 
continuity.  Once MKs have approved the anti-trafficking 
bill's continuity status, it will then return to the 
Constitution and Law Committee.  The Constitution and Law 
Committee will need to combine the bill that passed the first 
reading, submitted by the government, with another version, 
submitted by MK Zehava Gal-On, and add language to address 
funding of bill provisions.  The committee will then submit 
the combined bill to the Knesset for its second and third 
readings.  According to the bill's authors and sponsors, it 
is possible that the Knesset can complete this complex 
process and pass the bill into law as quickly as two months 
from now.  End note.
