¶1. (SBU) The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has no 
objections to associating with the Copenhagen Accord in 
principle but wants to see concrete commitments from 
developed and major developing countries before taking 
action.  DCM delivered Reftel talking points to Ouch Borith, 
Secretary of State at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
International Cooperation (MFA), urging the RGC to associate 
itself with the Accord by January 31.  Ouch, who was part of 
the Cambodian delegation, said that he and his Minister were 
disappointed by both the process in Copenhagen and the lack 
of substance in the Accord.  Ouch said he appreciated 
President Obama's personal involvement in the later stages of 
the conference, but regretted that the Accord did not include 
binding emissions reduction commitments and definitions of 
the assistance mechanisms for developing countries.  The 
viability of the Accord, Ouch argued, depended directly on 
commitments from developed and major developing countries. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ministry of Environment (MOE) officials echoed Ouch 
Borith's comments in conversations with ESTHOff.  Officials 
at the MOE's Climate Change Office (CCO) similarly praised 
U.S. leadership at Copenhagen, with one even saying that 
President Obama had "saved" the negotiations.  CCO officials 
had strong concerns though about the effectiveness of the UN 
process after the negotiations, saying that the Accord was 
realistic given the number of divergent views presented at 
the conference, but that it lacked teeth.  However, despite 
these concerns the MOE has submitted an analysis of the 
Accord to the MFA recommending that Cambodia join.  The head 
of the CCO doubted, however, that the RGC would make a 
decision by January 31 and noted that the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat's 
notification to the RGC had described the 31st as a soft 
deadline. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: Post expects that the RGC will eventually 
associate itself with the Accord; as a least developed 
country, Cambodia will not jeopardize its chances at 
accessing pledged assistance for issues like adaptation and 
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation 
(REDD) projects.  But Cambodia was clearly affected by the 
negotiation process in Copenhagen, and wants to see that 
larger players are taking the Accord seriously before 
committing to do the same.
