¶1. (SBU) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 3. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Poloff met with Moroccan Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) Head of Section of Security and Disarmament 
Affairs Bouchaib Eloumni on June 17 to discuss reftel and 
Morocco's level of interest in membership of the G-8 Global 
Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of 
Mass Destruction (GP).  Eloumni opined that in principle, 
Morocco has always been a supporter of initiatives that 
ensure a world free of weapons of mass destruction; however, 
the concept of possibly being invited to join the GP is new, 
was never before open to countries like Morocco, and is 
something that Morocco never even considered before now. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Action Request: Eloumni expressed concern about 
possible overlaps with the Proliferation Security Initiative 
(PSI) in which Morocco already participates.  He promised to 
share details of the GP outreach initiative within the next 
48 hours with his supervisors at the MFA but explained that 
determining Morocco's position on this inquiry will require 
consultations and time.  In response to GOM questions, Post 
requests guidance in how to explain to our Moroccan 
counterparts the differences between various agencies dealing 
with non-proliferation issues (i.e. PSI and GP) and the role 
that Morocco would be expected to play in each one.
