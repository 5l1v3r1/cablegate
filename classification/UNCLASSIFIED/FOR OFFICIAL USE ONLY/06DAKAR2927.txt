¶1.  (SBU) Currently the Senegalese Government does not have a 
specifically designated national list of banned terrorist entities. 
Rather, separate lists are maintained by different intelligence and 
enforcement agencies. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The five agencies maintaining names of banned terrorist 
entities are the following: 
 
a.  ANSE (Agence Nationale de Securite), which works specifically 
for the Presidential palace. 
 
b.  CECLAT (Cellule de Lutte Anti-Terroriste), which works 
specifically for the Ministry of Interior. 
 
c.  DST (Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire), a Ministry of 
Interior office responsible for investigating foreign activities 
inside the borders. 
 
d.  DPAF (Direction de la Police de l'Air et des Frontieres), an 
agency separated from the DST last year but remaining in the 
Ministry of Interior and functioning as an immigration police. 
 
e.  DDSE (Direction de la Documentation et Securite Exterieure), the 
intelligence service for the military; the equivalent of the DIA. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In early 2007, the GOS plans to unveil a consolidated 
strategic intelligence center that would develop one list to be made 
available to other agencies.  This group, the Centre d'Orientation 
Strategique (COS), is in its preliminary stages of development.
