SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Finland's Ministry of Justice is considering 
naming its Director of International Affairs, Matti Joutsen, as a 
candidate to replace UNODC Executive Director Antonio Maria Costa, 
who is lobbying for an extension after his second term expires in 
May 2010 (Reftels). As several EU countries (UK, the Netherlands and 
Norway) have indicated their opposition to Costa's extension based 
on the two term-limit principle, the politicking for Costa's 
potential replacement can be expected to intensify.   END SUMMARY.

The Joutsen Exploratory Committee

¶2. (SBU) In a July 6 phone call, Finland's Ambassador to the UN in 
Vienna, Kirsti Kauppi, told Charg that Finland's Ministry of 
Justice is considering announcing its Director of International 
Affairs, Matti Joutsen, as a candidate to replace UNODC Executive 
Director Antonio Maria Costa. Kauppi touted Joutsen's law 
enforcement credentials, exemplified by his work on the Crime 
Commission, where he supported efforts to combat violence against 
women. She added that Helsinki will soon decide whether or not to 
put forward Joutsen as a candidate, acknowledging that his lack of 
experience with drug issues was a potential weakness. Responding to 
Kauppi's query, Charg shared the U.S. view of opposition to a Costa 
extension (Ref B), emphasizing this is an "if asked" position. When 
Charg noted Swedish Ambassador Hans Lundborg's rumored interest in 
the post, Kauppi said it was her understanding that Lundborg was not 
interested in the business or travel associated with the position. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mission previously reported that the UK shared the US 
position on term limits (Ref A).  At the closed session of the Major 
Donors meeting on July 1, Netherlands raised the issue of Costa's 
extension, and voiced its opposition.  Norway seconded Netherland's 
position. Both stressed the importance of upholding the two-term 
limit principle for senior UN positions, as required by UNGA 
resolution A/RES/51/241 (Ref B).  However, they also seemed at a 
loss of what to do, noting the UN Secretary General (SYG) alone 
makes the nomination to these senior positions. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  Mission has had contact with Joutsen on UN crime 
issues, and considers him to be steeped in the core issues of UNODC, 
especially crime control, but lacking the diplomatic and leadership 
skills required of an Executive Director to advance such issues. 
Mission will further inquire about Sweden's intention regarding 
Costa's position and would welcome insights from Embassy Stockholm. 
We also believe the SYG's push for gender balance will play a part 
in his decision, should a qualified woman candidate come along.  In 
any case, the politicking for the position, whether from Costa, or 
another candidate, can be expected to intensify.  End Comment.
