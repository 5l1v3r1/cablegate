SUBJECT:  FIGHTING RESUMES IN NORTH DARFUR AS NRF CAPTURES UM SIDIR 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) UN sources report that on September 11, National Redemption 
Front (NRF) forces attacked and recaptured Um Sidir, 90 km north of 
El Fasher.  In reprisal for the NRF attack, on September 12, 
Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) initiated bombing of Um Sidir and 
Hashaba North.  It is believed that SAF ground forces will most 
likely follow the aerial bombardment within 24-48 hours.  These 
forces are likely to come from the Kutum, Kafod, and Mellit staging 
areas, possibly extending along the Kutum-Kulkul-Mellit line.  There 
are also reports of fighting in the Dobo area, East Jebel Marra, and 
the region from Tawilla to Tabarat and surrounding areas.  Note: 
Embassy Political Specialist in El Fasher also reports fighting, to 
include the hijacking of several Government vehicles, resulting in 
many killed and wounded, with wounded being medevaced to hospitals 
in El Fasher.  End note. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  The NRF attack on Um Sidir is likely an attempt 
to forestall the SAF offensive pushing northwest out of El Fasher 
into rebel-held areas of North Darfur.  SAF ground troops are 
expected to retake and hold Um Sidir in coming days.  End comment.
