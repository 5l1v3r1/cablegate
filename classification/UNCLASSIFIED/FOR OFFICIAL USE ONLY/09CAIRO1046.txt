1.(SBU): The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced yesterday, June 8th, 
that two American students enrolled in summer courses at the 
American University in Cairo (AUC) tested positive for the H1N1 
virus.  The students, who arrived on different flights but were 
living in the same AUC dormitory, were subsequently hospitalized, 
treated and quarantined at a local hospital.  They are recuperating 
in a dedicated H1N1 ward and expected to be released in the next 48 
hours. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The MOH yesterday placed the dormitory under quarantine. 
As a result of the two confirmed cases and acting on the 
recommendation of the MOH, AUC suspended all classes until Sunday, 
June 14th. The commanding officer for NAMRU-3 has made repeated 
visits to the dormitory and spoken in person to quarantined students 
over the last two days. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Five more confirmed H1N1 cases from the dormitory were 
reported today by Health Minister Hatem El-Gabaly.  According to the 
MOH, the five students are hospitalized and in stable condition. 
The additional cases were discovered after the MOH tested all 
residents at the dormitory.  All other dorm residents and staff 
tested negative for the H1N1 virus, have been placed on prophylaxis 
and the quarantine extended to not later than June 15th.
