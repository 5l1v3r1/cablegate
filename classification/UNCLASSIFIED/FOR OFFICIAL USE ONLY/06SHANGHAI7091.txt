¶1. (SBU) Summary:  In a series of conversations in late October 
and November, China Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS) Vice 
General Manager Song Jianqi and Market Development Manager 
Justin Zhang discussed recent forex market developments, 
including continued gradual appreciation, increased intra-day 
volatility, growth of currency swaps (and death of forwards), 
and extension of hours for the matching exchange system.  They 
also described some of the reforms CFETS planned to implement 
over the following six months, including a revision of CFETS 
fee-structure and migration to a new Reuters-based trading 
platform.  Zhang said the State Administration for Foreign 
Exchange (SAFE) was considering a policy change to allow traders 
to hold net open positions shorting the dollar.  Song said 
CFETS' agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to 
offer RMB-based derivatives was on track to begin in June 2007. 
Discussions with Shanghai forex traders will be reported septel. 
 End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
CFETS: MORE APPRECIATION IS MORE APPRECIATED, RIGHT? 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) CFETS Song began an October 24 meeting with P/E Chief 
and Econoff by noting the continued appreciation of the RMB, 
quipping, "More appreciation is more appreciated, right?"  He 
stated that the continued, gradual, and steady appreciation of 
the RMB demonstrated the successful working of the market in 
determining the value of the RMB.  He further said that inter- 
and intra-day movements in the market demonstrated that the RMB 
was moving based on market news and policy changes.  He noted 
that when Secretary Paulson visited China in September, the 
market reflected this with "more active trading within a larger 
band." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Zhang stated that over-the-counter (OTC) trading (begun 
in January 2006), represented more than 90 percent of all spot 
exchange transactions by the end of October 2006.  Nonetheless, 
CFETS would continue to maintain its more expensive matching 
exchange model for customers who were too small to have the 
technical know-how, infrastructure and credit history to engage 
in OTC trading. In fact, on October 1, it had extended the hours 
for the matching system (which previously closed at 3:30 PM) to 
coincide with those of the OTC market; i.e. both now closed at 
5:30 PM. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Zhang added that 80 percent of all foreign exchange 
(forex) trades handled by CFETS were done by its 15 Market 
Makers, 10 percent by the other 245 CFETS members, and the 
remaining 10 percent of forex trades were made through CFETS by 
other banks and institutions.  Of forex trades made by market 
makers, 70 percent were made by the nine Chinese banks and 30 
percent by the six foreign banks.  When asked what the total 
volume of forex trade handled by CFETS, Song stated that CFETS 
was not authorized to release that information, but noted that 
daily trade volumes had doubled since January 2006.  (Note: 
Standard Charted Stephen Green observed on October 26, that 
"probably only two people at CFETS know the answer to that 
question -- President Xie Duo and the technician who presses the 
buttons confirming each trade."  End note.) 
 
¶5. (SBU) CFETS outlined the "smooth market development" of its 
swap forex trading system.  When swaps began, daily volume was 
about $20 million.  During the third quarter, approximately $70 
million worth was swapped per day.  In October, total volume of 
currency exchanged through swaps was $400 million per day 
according to Song.  International banks accounted for more than 
50 percent of the swap market.  Song added that when the 
People's Bank of China (PBOC) raised deposit and lending 
interest rates in August, this was reflected in swap points. 
When asked about the forward market, Zhang didn't provide 
specifics, but noted that volume had dropped off.  He said that 
 
SHANGHAI 00007091  002 OF 003 
 
 
was because it was easier to do a combination swap and OTC trade 
than to do a forward contract. 
 
---------------------------------- 
CFETS TO REVISE ITS FEE STRUCTURES 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Claiming that CFETS was responsive to the needs of its 
consumers, Song said that CFETS would revise its current fee 
structure when its new trading platform was brought online in 
1st Quarter 2007.  He said that the new fees would be "more 
reasonable," with multiple rates based on trading volumes.  The 
new platform, which Song and Zhang admitted would be a welcome 
replacement to the current unwieldy system, would be based on 
Reuters' software customized for CFETS by Reuters, with some 
"back office domestically-produced software." 
 
¶7. (SBU) Song also explained the genesis of its current 
high-priced fee structure.  He said that in the past, CFETS 
provided a number of free services to its member banks, but was 
only permitted by SAFE to charge for its forex services.  By 
June 2006, CFETS had begun charging its members for all of its 
services, which included such things as RMB inter-bank lending 
and RMB bond trading.  (Note: See  HYPERLINK 
"http://www.chinamoney.com.cn"www.chinamoney. com.cn for more 
information on these services.  End note.)  Song noted that the 
new platform to be released next year would combine all of these 
transactions on one system.  With a fee for service model in 
place, CFETS would be able to reduce its overall charges on 
forex trading.  Song claimed that certain forex trading rates 
would be reduced by 30 times their current prices. 
 
------------------------ 
THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT 
------------------------ 
 
¶8. (SBU) Song said that CFETS had heard many complaints from 
traders that the limitations preventing net open positions from 
shorting the dollar (or longing the RMB) were a significant 
problem in developing China's forex markets.  As a result, he 
understood SAFE was considering a policy change to allow forex 
traders to take both long and short positions on the U.S. 
dollar.  Song expected a ruling in the first quarter of 2007. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
CFETS-CME: BEHIND SCHEDULE, BUT STILL ON-TRACK 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶9. (SBU) Song stated that the CFETS-CME Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) to offer forex derivatives (ref C) was still 
on track, but that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission's (CFTC) approval process had somewhat delayed 
progress on CME's side.  Song said that CFETS expected that the 
approval process would be completed by March 2007 and that CFETS 
and CME planned their launch for July 2007.  He noted that CFETS 
already had sent one staff delegation to Chicago for training in 
October and planned to send two more before the launch.  CME's 
Chief Operating Officer Phupinder Gill was scheduled to meet 
with CFETS President Xie Duo on October 25.  In addition, CME 
had recently posted one of its staff, Mr. Hao Lian from CME's IT 
& Risk Management department, to be based at CFETS in Shanghai 
to act as liaison until the product launched.  Zhang noted that 
CME's own RMB-based derivative products, listed in August, were 
not a competitive threat and had not been active. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
OFFSHORE RMB FORWARDS ARE NOT "SAFE"... 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) According to press reports, on October 25, SAFE 
announced that Chinese institutions and individuals were barred 
from trading offshore RMB derivatives without SAFE's prior 
approval.  Song explained that most such activity currently took 
place on Hong Kong's Non Deliverable Forwards (NDF) market, 
which allowed traders to speculate on the future value of the 
RMB despite its not being freely-traded in the international 
market.  He said the policy change was intended by SAFE to bring 
 
SHANGHAI 00007091  003 OF 003 
 
 
more of the RMB trading under its control.  Song said this 
ruling would not affect plans for the CFETS-CME products, but 
refused to comment on what SAFE's announcement would mean for 
CME's already-launched RMB-derivative products.  Zhang added 
that CFETS closely tracked the Hong Kong NDF market and was 
pleased to see closer correlation between it and the CFETS 
market. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
...BUT RESTRICTIONS LEAD TO INCREASED RMB APPRECIATION 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) On November 28, Zhang told Econoff that SAFE's October 
25 statement restricting Chinese institutions from participating 
in the overseas (and Hong Kong) NDF market had been largely 
aimed at halting these institutions' profiting from cheaper 
price of the U.S. dollar on the NDF market than in China.  He 
noted, however, the result had been, "when these traders 
withdrew from the market, it led to even more appreciation of 
the RMB."  Zhang speculated that this appreciation had not been 
SAFE's intent.  He added that while most of this arbitrage 
trading had halted, the resultant appreciation of the RMB had 
led to an increased profit margin for Chinese financial 
institutions and individuals willing to skirt the law. 
 
----------------------------------- 
CFETS RELOCATED FROM BUND TO PUDONG 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶12. (SBU) CFETS, formally housed in a 19th Century classical 
building on the Bund that once housed the Guomindang's Central 
Bank, moved operations in September to its new campus, located 
at 1387 Zhangdong Road, Number 30 in Shanghai's Pudong New Area. 
 CFETS is now located within a new office complex of three-story 
buildings that would not be out of place in any U.S. suburban 
high-tech industrial park.  Song explained that CFETS occupied 
five of the buildings with plans to expand into two more.  He 
said that one building housed its main offices, another building 
housed its computer mainframes and technical equipment, and the 
other three were used for its administrative and technical 
staff.  CFETS was not entirely relinquishing control to its 
former prime location.  After a two-year renovation, CFETS 
executives would return, but the majority of staff would remain 
in Pudong. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
COMMENT: PLEASE DO NOT LOOK BEHIND THE CURTAIN 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶13. (SBU) It is clear that CFETS administrators are doing what 
they can to lay the foundation for a fully-functioning and open 
forex system and are continually making adjustments, as 
reflected in plans to upgrade the trading platforms and fee 
structures to international standards.  Song's assertion that 
CFETS responds to its customers demonstrates a willingness to 
learn and adapt.  CFETS likes to claim that the value of the RMB 
is based purely on the functioning of the free market.  However, 
the continued lack of transparency in the formula by which the 
RMB reference price is set every morning highlights the fact 
that it is China's political leaders who are currently setting 
the price, not the market.
