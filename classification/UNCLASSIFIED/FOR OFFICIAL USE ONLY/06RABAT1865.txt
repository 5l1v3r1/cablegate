¶1.  This cable is sensitive but unclassified, please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Reftel demarche was delivered to Nasser Bourita, 
Director of United Nations and International Organizations, 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on October 5.  (Note: 
Bourita was not in the country prior to September 26, making 
an earlier delivery date impossible.  End Note.) Bourita 
emphasized that the government of Morocco (GOM) thinks that 
the UN Human Rights Council should be an example for the UN 
reform process and that the GOM's position was clearly 
articulated. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Bourita discussed the position of nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs) in detail.  He indicated that the GOM is 
concerned that large, international NGOs are creating a 
"corporate world," overshadowing what local NGOs have to 
offer.  At the same time, he noted that local NGOs do not 
always have the capacity to research agenda items for council 
meetings nor do they necessarily have the financial support 
to participate in meetings.  Bourita advocated defining the 
role of NGOs in the council precisely and making sure that 
country-specific NGOs are not overlooked, especially when 
specific countries are on the agenda.  His concerns focused 
on what he perceives as a misunderstanding of country 
specific issues on the part of the council and the 
international NGOs.  He assured poloff that the GOM will 
continue to work with the council on defining the role of 
NGOs in the council's processes. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  According to Bourita, the Community of Democracies 
(CD) needs to take a more active role in the UN and needs to 
discuss in detail the role of NGOs.  He also said that the 
GOM has expressed this opinion most recently during the 61st 
UNGA meeting.  He emphasized that no country is a model for 
another and that each democracy must share its experiences 
with others and at the same time learn from others.
