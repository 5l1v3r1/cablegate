SUBJECT: MFA DISCUSSES REFORM AND COUNTERTERRORISM WITH 
CAPSTONE DELEGATION 
 
 
¶1.  (U) This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please 
protect accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Summary: On February 28, a visiting CAPSTONE 
delegation, led by Admiral (Ret.) Henry Chiles, met with MFA 
Secretary General Omar Hilale to discuss bilateral and 
 
SIPDIS 
security issues.  Highlighting Morocco's reform efforts, 
Hilale underscored that decisions to reform have been 
inspired internally and are not the result of outside 
pressure.  He emphasized Morocco's strategic position in the 
region and its strong cooperation with the U.S., particularly 
on counterterrorism.  Hilale called for U.S. support of 
Morocco's efforts towards a solution to the Western Sahara 
conflict.  Commenting on reports of a decline in public 
opinion in Morocco towards the U.S., Hilale said Moroccans 
are not fundamentally anti-American, but that the drop in 
favorable views is likely the result of resentment towards 
U.S. policies in the region.  End Summary. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Omar Hilale, Secretary General at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, received February 28 a visiting delegation 
from the CAPSTONE course at the National Defense University. 
Hilale highlighted the government's internal reform efforts 
and the leadership role Morocco has taken in the region on 
this front.  He recognized U.S. support, but noted that 
Morocco,s reforms are "not inspired from outside," and are 
the result of decisions taken at the highest levels.  "With 
Morocco oriented toward the future, there is no alternative," 
he explained.  Hilale also outlined traditional internal 
challenges for the government such as unemployment, 
illiteracy, and poverty, adding that Morocco now faces a very 
serious and dangerous challenge in extremism. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Hilale used the opportunity with a senior U.S. 
military audience to emphasize Morocco,s strategic position 
in the region, as well as its strong cooperation with the 
U.S. on counterterrorism.  In this light, Hilale said the 
stability of the region depends on the stability of Morocco. 
Hilale expressed the government's concern about the increase 
of terrorist activity in the Maghreb and stressed the 
importance of international cooperation and strategic 
partnerships to combating this trend.  The Sahel, he 
explained, poses a particular problem because many countries 
are unable to effectively secure their borders.  He detailed 
Morocco's long-standing historical ties to Africa, and 
recalled a saying by the late Hassan II: "Morocco is like a 
tree; with roots in Africa and branches in Europe." 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Hilale expressed hope that the U.S-Morocco 
partnership on security issues would continue, and reiterated 
the role financial resources play in the ability of Morocco 
to combat terrorism.  In this context Hilale raised 
Morocco,s hosting of the first meeting of the Global 
Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and its active role in 
the forum as evidence of Morocco,s support of multilateral 
efforts to combat the terrorism threat. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Turning to the Western Sahara, Hilale made a strong 
plea to the visiting delegation for U.S. support of Morocco's 
efforts towards a solution to the conflict.  Hilale said a 
solution to the Western Sahara would help eliminate the risk 
of expanded terrorist activity in the Sahel region, implying 
that the region could become a sanctuary for terrorist 
without progress toward a solution.  Hilale also questioned 
Algeria's use of government resources; "Morocco invests in 
development while Algeria invests in military arms," he said. 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Commenting on a recent report of declining public 
opinion in Morocco towards the U.S., Hilale explained that 
the Moroccan population is not fundamentally anti-American, 
but suggested that the decline in favorable attitudes likely 
reflects an increase in disapproval of US policies in Iraq 
and elsewhere in the region.  Hilale added that, in his view, 
the negative shift in public opinion could be reversed if 
there were progress on key Middle East issues.  Hilale shared 
several thoughts on ways to improve the image of the U.S. in 
Morocco, which included publicizing all levels of U.S. 
cooperation in Morocco; from civil society activities to 
humanitarian projects to educational and cultural outreach.
