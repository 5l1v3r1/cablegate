¶1.  (SBU) PolChief conveyed points in Ref B to MFA U/S for 
Multilateral Affairs Gonzalo Salvador on October 12 and 
congratulated the GOE for its principled public statement 
condemning the DPRK's nuclear test.  Salvador said the GOE 
shared international opprobrium against the DPRK's test and 
would strongly support UNSC and international efforts to 
respond to the DPRK nuclear threat. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) PolOff had earlier conveyed Ref A points to MFA 
Director General Lourdes Puma, on October 6.  Puma indicated 
that the GOE shared USG concerns and opposed proliferation 
and the development of nuclear weapons.  The GOE would 
support positions reacting to the test developed by consensus 
in the UNSC. 
 
¶3.  (U) On October 9, the GOE issued a statement lamenting 
the DPRK's failure to return to the negotiating table and 
expressing profound concern with the DPRK's announced nuclear 
test.  Going further, the statement expressed GOE support for 
"measures discussed by the international community, 
especially those of the United Nations Security Council."
