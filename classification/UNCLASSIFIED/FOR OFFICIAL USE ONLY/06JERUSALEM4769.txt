SUBJECT: PALESTINIAN EMIGRATION ON THE RISE 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) THE PALESTINIAN DIASPORA AND REFUGEE CENTER (SHAML) 
ANNOUNCED AT AN OCTOBER 31 PRESS CONFERENCE THAT THE 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE WEST BANK AND GAZA IS 
CONTRIBUTING TO A MARKED INCREASE IN PALESTINIAN EMIGRATION. 
ACCORDING TO SHAML, FOREIGN DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS HAVE APPROVED 
10,000 IMMIGRATION APPLICATIONS SINCE JUNE 2006 AND AN 
ADDITIONAL 45,000 IMMIGRATION APPLICATIONS ARE UNDER 
CONSIDERATION. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) PA DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AHMED SOBOH, 
SPEAKING AT THE SAME PRESS CONFERENCE IN RAMALLAH, COMPLAINED 
THAT NO ONE IS CONCENTRATING ON THE EXODUS OF PALESTINIANS, 
PARTICULARLY THE DEPARTURE OF PROFESSIONALS, INVESTORS AND 
BUSINESSMEN.  SOBOH SAID THAT NON-PAYMENT OF SALARIES IS ALSO 
PROMPTING PA EMPLOYEES TO LEAVE.  HE ASSERTED THAT THERE HAS 
BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PALESTINIANS WITH 
UNIVERSITY DEGREES DEPARTING TO PURSUE CAREERS IN MORE STABLE 
COUNTRIES.  SOBOH ADDED THAT ISRAEL'S PRACTICE OF DENYING 
RE-ENTRY TO MANY PALESTINIANS WHO CARRY FOREIGN PASSPORTS IS 
ALSO DISCOURAGING PALESTINIANS WHO HAD RETURNED IN THE PAST 
DECADE FROM STAYING.  HE STATED THAT BETWEEN 1994-2000 ABOUT 
235,000 PALESTINIANS RETURNED TO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA, BUT 
SUGGESTED THAT THE TREND IS NOW IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) A BIRZEIT UNIVERSITY POLL PUBLISHED IN SEPTEMBER 
2006 CONCLUDED THAT 32 PERCENT OF PALESTINIANS WISH TO 
EMIGRATE.  AMONG PALESTINIANS IN THEIR 20S AND 30S, THE 
PERCENTAGE INTERESTED IN RELOCATING ROSE TO 44 PERCENT; AMONG 
YOUNG MEN 50 PERCENT.
