SUBJECT: DRUNKEN PASSENGER DISRUPTS TURKISH AIR FLIGHT, BUT 
NO HIJACKING 
 
¶1. (U) Turkish and international media reported October 15 
that a Turkish Airlines flight from Antalya, Turkey to St 
Petersburg, Russia had been hijacked during flight. 
Subsequent press reports said the hijacker had been subdued 
and that the flight was continuing on to St Petersburg. Still 
later reports said the passenger had sent a note to the pilot 
saying he had a bomb and threatening to blow up the plane. 
The plane landed at 3:20 PM in St Petersburg and the 
passenger was arrested. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kerem Alp of the MFA's Civil Aviation Office said "I 
would hesitate to call it a hijacking.  Its like a joke." 
Alp said the plane sent out a "Signal of Potential Distress," 
not a hijacking signal.  In communication with the plane, it 
appeared that a Russian passenger was becoming a security 
problem due to excessive alcohol consumption.  the plane 
later relayed that the situation was under control and it was 
proceeding on course to St Petersburg.  Alp said it was 
unclear if the drunken passenger was subdued by other 
passengers or "just fell asleep."  MFA was not treating the 
event as a hijacking.  He did not know if there were any 
Amcits on the flight. 
 
¶3. (U) Ali Ariduru, the Director General of Civil Aviation 
(DGCA) also said that the incident "was not a hijacking." 
DGCA Chief Aviation Security Expert Serdar Karabulut said the 
press reports were a "false alarm" and that the incident 
could not be treated as a hijacking.  He added that Russian 
authorities would investigate the passenger who caused the 
incident.
