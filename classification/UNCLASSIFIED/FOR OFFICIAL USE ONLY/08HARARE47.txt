SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR CALLS ON BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO BE 
ENGINE OF PEACEFUL CHANGE 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Beginning his outreach to Zimbabwe's beleaguered 
business community, on January 17 Ambassador challenged 
members of the American Business Association of Zimbabwe 
(ABAZ) to be more energetic in bringing about peaceful change 
in Zimbabwe.  Speaking at the monthly meeting of ABAZ, he 
said that the business community could be the engine that 
carries the country forward.  He called on it to step forward 
and make its collective voice heard.  He praised ABAZ for 
engaging ministers and ruling-party and opposition 
parliamentarians at its meetings, as well as for stimulating 
public debate on reform in public fora and organizing 
briefings for visiting IMF and World Bank missions.  But he 
called on the Association to ratchet up its public profile 
and its interaction with government, in particular with key 
parliamentary portfolio committee members and moderate 
members of government.  "Your voices need to be heard, but 
they also need to be louder; your actions need to be seen, 
but they also need to be bolder," Ambassador told a group of 
45 members representing 26 companies with U.S.-related 
businesses. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador enunciated the USG goal of advancing 
freedom by helping to build and sustain a more democratic, 
secure, and prosperous world composed of well-governed states 
that respond to the needs of their people, that reduce 
widespread poverty, and that act responsibly within the 
international system.  In furtherance of that goal, he 
emphasized that there would be no relenting on principles: 
the USG wants to see free and fair elections, respect for the 
rule of law, and respect for human and property rights in 
Zimbabwe.  To wide applause, he concluded by welcoming 
interaction with ABAZ and with individual members, as well as 
with the broader business community. 
 
¶3. (SBU) At the recommendation of several ABAZ members, the 
Zimbabwe branch of the Institute of Directors subsequently 
invited the Ambassador to address one of its monthly 
meetings.  In addition, Post is organizing a series of 
meetings for Ambassador with business leaders, and visits to 
major businesses.
