(sbu) In response to refs b and c, Foreign Affairs desk 
officer for Liberia Harsha Sirur reiterated to Econcouns that 
Canada would send an embassy representative to the February 
13-14 Liberia Partners Forum in Washington (see ref d).  He 
said, however, that no Canadians would likely attend the 
private sector conference on February 15.  Sirur, who has 
just returned from an extended visit to western Africa, 
stated that Canada's Department of Finance is still working 
on the government's position regarding the clearance of 
Liberia's arrears to the IFIs - and may have a decision next 
week before the Forum meets.  Sirur commented that Canada is 
pleased to see movement toward helping Liberia, but made it 
clear that his government is focusing its assistance efforts 
in western African on countries such as Ghana, Mali, Niger, 
Sierra Leone, and Cote d'Ivoire.
