SUBJECT: JERUSALEM CATHOLIC HOSPICE DESCRIBES PROBLEMS FROM 
CONSTRUCTION NEXT DOOR 
 
¶1.    (SBU) Summary.  During an April 25 meeting with ConGen 
Poloff, the lead attorney for the Hospice Saint Vincent de 
Paul -- a Vatican-supported institution situated near the Old 
City of Jerusalem -- appealed for USG intervention with the 
Government of Israel (GOI) in response to the construction of 
a neighboring condominium complex and pedestrian shopping 
area.  The attorney accused the GOI of failing to adhere to a 
1993 agreement intended to insure hospice control over the 
lone access road serving the facility and preserving its 
privacy.  The attorney said that the ongoing construction 
violated the terms of the 1993 agreement, and warned that the 
hospice may be compelled to cease operations altogether 
unless it can ensure complete control over the access road. 
End summary. 
 
Hospice Saint 
Vincent de Paul 
--------------- 
 
¶2.    (SBU) The land encompassing the Hospice Saint Vincent 
de Paul -- located in the Mamila section of West Jerusalem 
near the Old City -- was purchased by the Roman Catholic 
Church in 1884.  The building complex, which includes a 
convent, the St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church, a 
kindergarten, grade school, and child care facility, supports 
the daily needs of approximately 400 people, including 250 
permanent residents composed of abandoned children, senior 
citizens, and the mentally ill.  (Note: The hospice serves 
mainly Israeli Arabs and East Jerusalem Palestinians but 
includes some Jewish Israelis, including two residents who 
escaped from Nazi Germany.  End note.)  The hospice employs 
approximately 80 personnel, including doctors, teachers, and 
social workers.  Funding for the facility comes from the 
Israeli Ministry of Welfare as well as the Vatican and 
private donors. 
 
Lawyer Says Construction 
Violates 1993 Agreement 
------------------------ 
 
¶3.    (SBU) Jerusalem attorney Naeem Khoury told ConGen 
Poloff April 25 that the construction of an upscale 
condominium complex and pedestrian shopping area adjacent to 
the hospice violates a 1993 agreement between the GOI and the 
hospice.  According to Khoury, the agreement stipulated that 
a free motorway be provided for the exclusive use of the 
hospice for its service and transportation vehicles.  The 
agreement also required that any building construction in the 
adjacent area ensure the privacy of the convent by 
restricting the height of the surrounding buildings. 
 
¶4.    (SBU) Khoury said that a review of the construction 
site maps show that the building's main entrance would impede 
entry by hospice ambulances, buses for the handicapped, and 
emergency vehicles since it would place access to the 
facility at the discretion of the condominium.  Khoury added 
that the construction also violates the privacy of the 
convent since the surrounding buildings are slated to be 
built higher than the terms agreed to in the 1993 agreement. 
 
Fearing Closure, Attorney 
Appeals For USG Intervention 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5.    (SBU) Khoury said that he has initiated legal action in 
Jerusalem's district court but expressed doubts that he would 
successful in delaying the construction during the litigation 
period.  He anticipated that the presiding judge would deny 
his recent motion to halt the project altogether at the 
building site.  At the current pace of construction, Khoury 
expected that building construction would be completed 
sometime in 2008.  Khoury warned that the hospice might cease 
operations unless it secures total control over the access 
road.  He requested USG intervention with the Government of 
Israel on behalf of the hospice to ensure that the 1993 
agreement is upheld.
