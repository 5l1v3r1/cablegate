SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA: U.S. APPROACH TO 2010 NPT REVCON 
 
REF: STATE 126209 
 
(SBU) Pretoria welcomes the comprehensive guidance provided 
on the U.S. approach to the 2010 Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty Review Conference (NPT RevCon).  On December 19, we 
delivered reftel points to the Department of International 
Relations and Cooperation U.S. Desk and Directorate for 
Nuclear Disarmament and Nonproliferation. Deputy Political 
Counselor then followed up in a December 22 meeting with 
Deputy Director for Nuclear Disarmament and Nonproliferation 
Johann Kellerman. Recalling the useful NPT discussions that 
took place during Special Advisor Robert Einhorn's August 
visit to Pretoria, Kellerman said his government looks 
forward to further discussions on the NPT during the upcoming 
February visit of Ambassador Susan Burk. We will continue to 
seek opportunities to share the U.S. approach to the NPT 
RevCon with our South Africa interlocutors.
