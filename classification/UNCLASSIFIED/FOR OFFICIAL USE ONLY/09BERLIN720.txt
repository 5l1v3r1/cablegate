SUBJECT: GERMANY H1N1 FLU UPDATE: 195 CONFIRMED CASES 
 
REF:  A) Berlin 714, B) Berlin 710 and previous. 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY: The number of H1N1 cases in Germany rose to 
195 on June 16, as twenty-three more people were confirmed to 
be infected with the virus.  Most of the spike in H1N1 cases 
occurred in North Rhine-Westphalia.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On June 16, the National Reference Center for 
Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in its 
press briefing twenty-three new laboratory-confirmed cases of 
H1N1 in Germany.  This increases the total number of confirmed 
cases in Germany to 195.  The new cases were distributed among 
the federal states as follows: North Rhine-Westphalia (19), 
Hesse (1), Bavaria (1), Berlin (1), and Saxony (1). 107 of the 
total 195 confirmed infections occurred in Germany. 
 
 
Cases in North Rhine-Westphalia on the rise 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU)  According to RKI, most of the recent cases in 
Germany involve children and young adults at the Japanese 
school in Duesseldorf and a school in Cologne (Ref A, B) who 
tested positive for H1N1 last week.  The two schools will 
remain temporarily closed in order to minimize the risk of 
further transmission to other children.  State Health Minister 
Karl-Josef Laumann said last week that the state was well- 
prepared to deal with the pandemic, assuring that the "best 
possible health protection of the population continues to be 
guaranteed."  He announced the establishment of a council of 
experts to advise the state government on the measures to be 
taken.  The eight-member panel includes professors of the 
medical schools at the Universities of Bonn, Duesseldorf and 
Muenster as well as the directors of the health departments of 
Duesseldorf and Cologne. 
 
 
Second Case of H1N1 in Berlin 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  On June 16 RKI confirmed one additional case of H1N1 
in Berlin, raising the total number of confirmed infections in 
the city to two.  According to the Berlin Senate for Health, 
Environment and Consumer, a 30-year old male tested positive 
for the virus. He recently returned from a trip to Romania and 
may have contracted the virus there.  Media reports indicate 
that a third person in Berlin, the partner of the original 23- 
year old woman who was confirmed to be infected (see ref A), 
has likely been infected with the virus, as he shows flu-like 
symptoms.  So far, RKI has not confirmed this case, but the 
man has been put under quarantine at home pending results of 
testing.
