¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche to Agnese Vilde of the MFA's 
Human Rights Policy Division.  Vilde said that Latvia is deeply 
concerned about the human rights situation in Iran.  Latvia has and 
will continue to speak against the deteriorating situation in Iran. 
The MFA's Political Director has demarched the Iranian Ambassador 
(resident in Stockholm) on the topic of human rights.  Vilde added 
that many EU countries have demarched Iran regarding human rights 
over the past few months.  Latvia has no plans for a national public 
statement regarding Iran but has endorsed the recent joint US-EU 
statement.

Rights Council, Vilde said that the EU will have a common position 
on this vote and the official decision has not yet been made.
