¶1. (SBU) Post appreciates the opportunity to review 
the Department of Labor's draft update to its list 
of products that have been "mined, produced or 
manufactured using forced or indentured child labor" 
pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13126 (Ref A). 
Post concurs with the list and has no additions or 
deletions to recommend. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post would also like to reiterate the 
caveats expressed in Ref B and previous and request 
that these concerns be incorporated in E.O. 13126 
process documentation as appropriate.
