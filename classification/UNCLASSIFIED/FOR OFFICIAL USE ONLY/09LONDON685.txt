(SBU) The UK plans to announce a contribution of GBP 4.9 
million (USD 6.8 million) to the African Union for AMISOM and 
of GBP 10 million (USD 14 million) to the UN's AMISOM Trust 
Fund this week, according to Foreign Office Peacekeeping Team 
leader Chris Campbell.  While the announcement is contingent 
on final authorization from the Foreign Office Finance 
Director, HMG plans to announce the AU contribution on 
Wednesday, March 18 during the UN Security Council discussion 
of the joint UN-AU panel report on support for AU 
peacekeeping operations.  The Trust Fund contribution is 
scheduled to be announced during the Friday, March 20 open 
debate on Somalia.  Campbell requested that these 
contributions not be discussed publicly until after the UK's 
official announcements.
