Your Excellency: 
 
The Romanian Public Ministry - Prosecutor's Office attached 
to the High Court of Cassation and Justice presents its 
cordial salute to the Embassy of the United States of 
America in Bucharest, and has the great honor to thank your 
Excellency and your representatives for the support granted 
in the investigation that led to the release of the three 
Romanian journalists. 
 
Your support is the proof of Romania's cooperation on all 
levels with the United States of America and a guarantee for 
future enlargement of the relations between the judicial 
authorities of our countries. 
I take this opportunity to kindly ask for your support in 
establishing a contact with the Director of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation.  A direct contact would be very 
helpful for us in obtaining the agreement for joining the 
interrogation of Mohamed Munaf, who at present is in the 
custody of the U.S. authorities in Iraq.  We stress the fact 
that from our investigations resulted with certainty that 
Mohamed Munaf was involved in the kidnapping of the three 
Romanian journalists and is also a suspect in several cases 
of organized crime related offences and economic offenses. 
 
I use this opportunity, Your Excellency, to assure you of my 
highest consideration. 
 
Ilie Botos 
General Prosecutor of Romania
