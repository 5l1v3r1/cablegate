SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED:  ARAB LEAGUE CENTRAL BOYCOTT 
OFFICE MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 150661 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) A/DCM discussed reftel demarche with the Director 
of the MFA's Arab World Department, Ambassador Jasim 
Al-Mubaraki, and MFA Second Secretary Ahmed Al-Baqer, who 
handles Arab League issues within the Arab World Department, 
on November 4.  A/DCM stressed that the perpetuation of the 
Arab League boycott is an obstacle to Middle East peace and a 
barrier to international trade.  Al-Baqer downplayed GOK 
attendance at the boycott meeting, noting that Kuwait would 
send a customs official rather than a diplomat from the MFA. 
A/DCM responded that this was the same level of participation 
as in previous years and urged the GOK to end its attendance 
entirely.
