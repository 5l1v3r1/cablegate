REF: 06 QUITO 2681 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary:  Ecuador continues to arrest, prosecute, 
convict and sentence TIP offenders.  Superstar El Oro 
province prosecutor Lucy Blacio added another two convictions 
to her credit in April.  Pichincha province gained two this 
month, the first convictions outside El Oro under Ecuador's 
modern anti-TIP statute.  Arrests continue apace nationwide 
and the GOE has uncovered and exposed a network of children 
rented out to begging syndicates.  National authorities 
maintain expressions of commitment in the fight against TIP. 
End summary. 
 
First TIP Convictions in Pichincha, More Arrests 
 
¶2.  (U) On April 23, Pichincha province TIP prosecutor Thania 
Moreno won the conviction and sentencing of defendants for 
sexual exploitation of minors, marking the first TIP sentence 
outside of El Oro province under Ecuador's new anti-TIP law. 
The two defendants were part of the "La Luna" case (reftel), 
involving multiple defendants.  One sentenced defendant 
received the maximum 12 years and the other received six 
years in prison. The remaining defendants should be brought 
to trial soon, according to Moreno. 
 
¶3.  (U) On April 9 and 17, El Oro province TIP prosecutor 
Lucy Blacio won the conviction and sentencing of another two 
TIP defendants.  One defendant, a brothel owner, received 
four years of prison time for sexual exploitation of a minor. 
 The judge did not give the maximum of 12 years in this case, 
noting that the defendant cooperated in the investigation and 
claimed he didn't know the girl was underage.  Blacio has 
appealed the sentence, asking that the judge impose the full 
penalty of 12 years as the law specifies.  Another defendant 
in a separate case received the maximum of 12 years for his 
role in sexual exploitation of a minor.  The evidence 
revealed that the defendant forced a minor to work in various 
brothels, supplying her with fake documents in an attempt to 
falsify her age. 
 
¶4.  (U) The GOE continues to make TIP arrests around the 
country.  TIP arrests occurred in April in Santo Domingo, 
Pichincha province; in Machala, El Oro province; and in 
Portoviejo, Manabi province.  On April 14 national child 
welfare police agency DINAPEN uncovered a network of brokers 
in children transported to big cities and forced to beg from 
motorists on the streets.  Hailing mostly from poor 
indigenous areas, some children were found to be "sold" or 
"rented" by their parents.  Prosecutors in Pichincha and 
Tungurahua provinces are gathering evidence against 
organizers.  Community leaders have noted that the practice 
is well known and widespread. 
 
GOE Expresses Will to Combat TIP 
 
¶5.  (U) In a meeting with representatives of 12 GOE agencies, 
NGOs and USAID, Natalie Cely, Minister Coordinator for Social 
Development, expressed the GOE's continued commitment to 
fighting TIP.  In her role as super-minister coordinating the 
gamut of the GOE's social programs, she evinced an excellent 
grasp of TIP and a sincere desire to push the National 
Anti-TIP Plan forward.  In a separate meeting with EmbOffs, 
the deputy and international affairs directors of the 
Attorney General's office also expressed the will to continue 
to advance prosecutions of TIP cases nationwide. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment:  Instability in the attorney general's 
office and an overburdened and sometimes corrupt judicial 
system have not stopped the GOE from making a steady stream 
of arrests and winning a wave of convictions over the past 
six months.  Local prosecutors, police and judges continue to 
chalk up successes fighting TIP and the new government's 
leaders have pledged to continue the fight begun under the 
previous administration.  Prosecutors tell us more could be 
done if judges were less burdened and there were more 
resources for victim shelters.  We will continue to urge 
progress in these areas and assist where possible.
