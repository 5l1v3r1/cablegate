SUBJECT: TURKISH RESPONSE ON TAIWAN'S PARTICIPATION IN THE 
OECD 
 
REF: STATE 20058 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) On March 19, we shared reftel information and 
points with Ministry of Foreign Affairs Department Head for 
Multilateral Economic Affairs Serap Ozcoskun.  She agreed to 
share reftel points with the Turkish mission to the OECD. 
She noted the information has already been discussed in an 
informal reflection group, and the matter remains undecided 
in the OECD.  She added that most OECD members support 
continued practices outlined in the 1995 framework letters 
(NFI) and think it is appropriate for the OECD to follow 
international norms and ways to treat Taiwan's participation 
in the OECD.  She noted that the OECD Secretary General plans 
to travel to China next week.  If the Chinese Government 
opens reftel issue, she said he plans to respond by referring 
the matter to the OECD Council.  She expressed appreciation 
for the notification and will follow up with us in the future 
as appropriate.
