SUBJECT: Update on PKK Violence (November 16-23, 2007) 
 
REF: ANKARA 2798 and previous 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary source is the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) website, which documents contacts and clashes with the PKK as 
well as casualties incurred.  The TGS does not account for police 
casualties and the Ministry of Interior casualty date is not made 
public.  As a result, actual numbers for total Turkish law 
enforcement casualties are higher than the figures in this cable. 
Press services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) During the November 16-23, 2007 reporting period, no GOT 
security official was killed or injured in clashes. 
 
¶3. (U) In the same period, six PKK terrorists were captured. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported two clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists.  Since an October 21 terrorist ambush that 
resulted in the deaths of 12 soldiers, the Turkish military has been 
continuing non-stop operations in the region.  Security forces 
discovered at least 11 PKK shelters/caves/caches and seized 
booby-trapped land mines; other explosives, including A-4 and TNT; 
Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; hand grenades; pistols; night vision 
binoculars; TV sets; satellite antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. (U) During the reporting period, security forces detected at 
least five PKK explosive devices in SE Turkey, detonating several of 
them in controlled fashion before they could explode. 
 
¶6. (U) Activity as reported by TGS website:
