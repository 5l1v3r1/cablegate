     ¶B. BAGHDAD 766 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request for Embassy Baghdad; see 
paragraphs 4 and 5. 
 
Background 
---------- 
¶2. (U)  The UNCC was established in 1991 to process and pay 
claims for damages resulting from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
The UNCC issued awards (entitlements for claims payments) 
totaling more than USD 52 billion.  Kuwait or Kuwaiti 
nationals were awarded USD 41 billion.  Kuwait and Kuwaiti 
nationals have received more than USD 15 billion in claims 
payments from the UNCC Compensation Fund.  Other countries 
and their nationals have received about USD 11 billion in 
claims payments.  The award amounts remaining to be paid 
include USD 1.5 billion in environmental remediation awards 
and USD 24 billion in awards for Kuwait's oil sector.  The 
UNCC Governing Council (UNCC-GC) and Secretariat, starting in 
April 2008, have urged the Government of Iraq (GOI) to engage 
in settlement negotiations with regard to the USD 24 billion 
in oil sector awards.  Despite readiness on the part of the 
UNCC Secretariat and the Government of Kuwait (GOK) to 
commence such negotiations, GOI has consistently been 
unavailable on the proffered dates.  On February 9, 2009, the 
Secretariat sent a letter to GOI Prime Minister Maliki 
requesting assistance in expediting the negotiations (see 
reference). 
 
¶3. (U)  Pursuant to UNSCR 1483, UNCC claims are paid from a 5 
percent deduction from all Iraqi export sales of petroleum, 
petroleum products, and natural gas.  GOI has requested on 
numerous occasions, most recently in a March 10, 2009 letter 
to the President of the Security Council, that the deduction 
be lowered to one percent.  The UNCC-GC has insisted that GOI 
must negotiate in good faith with Kuwait with regard to the 
USD 24 billion in oil sector awards (and fully pay the 
environmental remediation awards) before a reduction in the 
deduction can be considered.  GOI also took the position in 
its March letter that because it has paid a high proportion 
of its compensation claims, the remaining claims should be 
annulled.  Kuwait submitted its reply, which likely rejected 
the GOI position, to the Security Council on March 24, 2009. 
 
Action Request 
-------------- 
¶4. (SBU) Embassy is requested to deliver a demarche to PM 
Maliki's legal adviser, Dr. Fadel Jawad Khadum, along the 
following lines: 
 
   - Stress the importance the USG attaches to Iraq sending 
appropriate level representation, with proper authority to 
engage in negotiations regarding the settlement of the USD 24 
billion in UNCC oil sector awards, to the April 28-29 UNCC-GC 
Meeting in Geneva. 
 
   - Discuss how these negotiations will demonstrate that GOI 
is ready to resolve fully the issues of the past, terminate 
the relevant Chapter VII UNSCR and restore its position as a 
member in good standing of the international community. 
 
   - Note that GOI Minister of Finance Jabr favors sending a 
high-level delegation, and that sending a low-level 
delegation might signal a lack of seriousness of purpose. 
 
   - Emphasize that the USG and the UNCC-GC expect good faith 
efforts by Iraq to enter into settlement discussions under 
UNCC auspices before the UNCC can consider Iraq's proposal to 
reduce the 5 percent deduction from GOI oil export revenues. 
 
   - Note that the Embassy is prepared to discuss the issue 
directly with PM Maliki, but first wants to hear Dr. Fadel's 
views and confirm his support. 
 
¶5. (U) The Department appreciates the Embassy's assistance in 
this matter.
