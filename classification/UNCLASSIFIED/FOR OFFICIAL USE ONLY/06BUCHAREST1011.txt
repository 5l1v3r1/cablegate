REF: BUCHAREST 704 
 
¶1. (SBU) Romanian Defense Ministry (MOD) sources confirm that 
a Romanian soldier was killed in action and four Romanian 
soldiers and an Afghan interpreter were wounded in 
Afghanistan June 20 at approximately 0300 local time.  MOD 
sources advise that one of the wounded Romanian soldiers is 
in critical condition and that two of the Romanian soldiers 
lost legs in the incident.  According to preliminary reports, 
a Romanian patrol was 20 kilometers from Kandahar returning 
to base when the lead vehicle was hit by an improvised 
explosive device (IED).  The MOD is withholding names of the 
WIA pending notification of the next of kin, but an MOD press 
release confirms the dead soldier was Corporal Ionel 
Gheorghita Dragusanu. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador will issue a statement of 
condolences June 20. So far, media reaction has been limited 
to a report of the incident, without editorial commentary. 
Romania's last combat fatality was in Iraq in April (Ref).
