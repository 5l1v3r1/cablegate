¶1.  (U) THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED AND NOT FOR 
INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The Brazilian delegation has expressed both 
public and private disappointment with the September 27-28 meeting 
in Washington of representatives of major economies to discuss 
energy security and climate change.  After learning at the meeting 
that the USG was not prepared to assume any mandatory obligations to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions the head of delegation, Ambassador 
Everton Vargas, Under Secretary for Policy from the Ministry of 
Exterior Relations dismissed USG efforts to show leadership on 
climate change, telling a leading Brazilian daily that, "You can 
only have leadership when you, in fact, do something."  Dr. Thelma 
Krug from the Environment Ministry also was disappointed, but 
thought the meeting was a positive because it gave a chance for 
further dialogue.  She supported having further such meetings, as 
long as they facilitated the UN process; and she urged that the 
United States accept France's offer to host the next meeting. 
Skeptical of USG intentions prior to the meeting and not happy with 
the results, Amb. Vargas also chose to complain to the press of what 
he saw as abusive conditions imposed by the Secret Service before 
President Bush's speech, reportedly telling organizers:  "Let's make 
one thing very clear. Choose one or the other: I am either a suspect 
or a guest!"  END SUMMARY. 
 
AMBASSADOR'S VARGAS TAKE:  SAME OLD, SAME OLD 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Brazilian delegation to the September 27-28 meeting in 
Washington of representatives of major economies to discuss energy 
security and climate change expressed skepticism and disappointment 
on their return.  The head of delegation, Ambassador Everton Vargas, 
Under Secretary for Policy from the Ministry of Exterior Relations 
(MRE) told O Globo (the leading national newspaper from Rio de 
Janeiro in an article published on September 29), that President 
"Bush did not provide any new ideas.  He only recited the old 
rhetoric and insisted on the resistance to a global goal for the 
reduction of greenhouse gases emissions," as stipulated in the Kyoto 
Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 
Vargas added, "We only saw the reiteration of what he [President 
Bush] had already said."  In the case of Brazil, Vargas explained, 
"We don't want this voluntary control approach.  Brazil is very much 
in favor of the multilateral approach." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The O Globo article reported that Vargas described 
President Bush as trying to convince people that he does not take 
global warming for granted anymore, but, "in fact, he only defended 
his stubborn position."  While President Bush suggested the creation 
of an international fund for clean technology, to develop ways to 
cut emissions, Vargas noted that that such funding already existed 
within the Kyoto Protocol. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Vargas stressed the Brazilian view about shaping 
responsibilities based on cumulative or historic emissions.  He 
explained, "Those who benefited from 200 years of development 
without any kind of concern about the consequences to the planet 
should lead a common effort.  Would it be fair for a developed 
country that has contributed so much to the increase of greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere not to commit to reducing emissions?" 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Vargas characterized the meeting as disappointing.  He

said the delegation had gone to Washington with the view that the 
meeting was a new opportunity to convince the United States to align 
itself with the majority of the countries.  This did not happen. 
Vargas downplayed President Bush's efforts to make the United States 
a leader on global climate change, saying he was using a proposal 
(i.e., one without obligations) that had already been rejected by 
the rest of the world.  He summed up, "You can only have leadership 
when you, in fact, do something." 
 
DR. KRUG'S VIEW:  DISAPPOINTING, BUT WITH SOME POSITIVES 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Dr. Thelma Krug, the Head of the Ministry of Environment's 
Climate Change Office, told ESTH Counselor  that the meeting was 
very disappointing.  She had hoped that the United States would 
signal its willingness to assume obligations to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions.  Brazil and other developing countries took the 
refusal to accept obligations as very negative, Krug opined.  She 
too stressed the Brazilian position that the agreement coming after 
the Kyoto Protocol should take into consideration "historic 
emissions". 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Krug worried that the sector by sector approach could lead 
to situations whereby companies might migrate to those countries 
with the least onerous emissions regimes.  She repeatedly 
underscored that Brazil doesn't want to see a parallel track created 
alongside the UNFCCC process.  She did see some positives.  She 
called having the dialogue on climate change as a very good thing, 
and that further such meetings would be quite positive so long as 
they facilitated the UNFCCC process and not work outside of it. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Finally, Dr. Krug strongly urged the United States to 
accept the French proposal to have the next meeting in France.  She 
thought it would be better for the process to go outside of United 
States for the next meeting. 
 
ADDITIONAL UPSET - PERCEIVED SLIGHT 
¶10.  (SBU) The newspaper O Globo in its September 29 edition 
described Ambassador Vargas and the Brazilian delegation, as well as 
other foreign delegations, as being poorly treated in Washington. 
In particular, it reported Brazilian complaints that the Secret 
Service required foreign delegations to the meeting to arrive at 
7:30 am.  This reportedly made delegations furious as the speech by 
President Bush was scheduled for 10:15 am.  Vargas said he went 
directly to the meeting's organizers and told them:  "Let's make one 
thing very clear. Choose one or the other: I am either a suspect or 
a guest!"  According to O Globo, Vargas  ignored the request and 
arrived at a time of his choosing and was allowed in.  Dr. Krug told 
ESTH Counselor that the Brazilian delegation was not mistreated, 
though she thought it was very excessive to have to go through two 
different sets of metal detectors.  (Note: State personnel present 
were also surprised by the newspaper account.  End note.) 
 
¶11.  (SBU) COMMENT: The Mission expects to follow up directly with 
Amb. Vargas to get his first-hand impressions.  However, the 
negative reaction is not surprising, based on the Brazilian 
skepticism going into the meeting (REF B).  END COMMENT.
