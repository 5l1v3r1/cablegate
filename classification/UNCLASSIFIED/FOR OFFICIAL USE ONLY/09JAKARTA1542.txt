¶2.  (SBU) Deputy Pol/C delivered reftel message urging 
support for a consensus outcome on Middle East issues at the 
September 2009 IAEA General Conference to Roy Soemirat of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs Directorate for International 
Security and Disarmament.  Soemirat said the GOI would take 
American views into account but noted that Indonesia had 
voted in favor of the Israeli Nuclear Capabilities resolution 
last year. He said he expected the GOI would maintain the 
same position unless there were unexpected developments at 
the General Conference that dictated otherwise.
