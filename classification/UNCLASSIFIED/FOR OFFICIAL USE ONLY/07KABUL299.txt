SUBJECT: MISLEADING PRESS REPORTS ON KARZAI'S ASHURA MESSAGE 
 
¶1. (SBU) As is the usual custom on religious holidays, 
President Karzai offered a message during the Ashura ceremony 
at the Takyakhana-e-Hussenia (Shiite Mosque) on January 29. 
It follows successful efforts by government and religious 
leaders and security forces to plan for a peaceful Ashura 
celebration which highlighted reconciliation rather than 
sectarian differences.  While some international press 
reports stated that Karzai's statement included an offer to 
negotiate with the Taliban, he did not in fact mention the 
Taliban.  Negotiations were offered as a possibility -- 
linked to reconciliation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Karzai did not use a prepared text, but there is a 
transcript of his remarks, which were given in Dari.  While 
there are several variations on the English translation, the 
one which Embassy interpreters believe is closest to the 
message is "while we are fighting for our honor against the 
enemy who seeks our annihilation and who is shedding our 
blood, we yet again open the paths of reconciliation and 
negotiation."  Another translation is "while we are fighting 
for our honor, we still open the door for reconciliation and 
negotiations with our enemy who is after our destruction and 
shedding our blood."  There have been several translations, 
and the resulting English is not precise, but our 
interpreters are confident the message was understood by 
Afghans as an invitation highlighting reconciliation as the 
basis for negotiations. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The message is also consistent with those offered 
by Karzai on previous holidays, including Eid in October, 
where he reiterated his invitation to Mullah Omar to accept 
the offer of reconciliaton.  Those remarks were also 
misreported or misinterpreted by some as an offer to 
negotiate with Mullah Omar.
