Summary 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) In June 2009, the Government of Bermuda moved onto the 
OECD's "white list" with the signing of the minimum required 12 
Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs).  Bermuda Government 
officials and international businesses hope that Bermuda's 
placement on the white list will deter possible U.S. legislation 
directed at tax havens that could drive business away from 
Bermuda.  Bermuda took quick action after the OECD in April 2009 
included Bermuda on the "grey list" of jurisdictions that have 
committed to international tax transparency standards but not 
yet implemented them.  End summary. 
 
 
 
The Crackdown on Tax Havens 
 
 
¶2. (U) Spurred by public outrage over big bonus-earning bankers 
and high-profile frauds by wealthy financiers, leaders pledged 
at the April G20 Summit in London to clamp down on tax havens. 
At the same time, the OECD issued its "grey list," which was 
split into two parts - one of countries, including Bermuda, 
labeled "tax havens" and another group, including Switzerland 
and Singapore, which were labeled "other financial centers." 
The OECD "grey listed" Bermuda in its progress report April 2, 
2009 citing its lack of follow-up action since the island's 
commitment to international tax transparency standards nine 
years ago.  The OECD defines a tax haven as a jurisdiction with 
no or nominal tax, a lack of information exchange, a lack of 
transparency, and no substantial local activities.  Soon after 
the progress report was published, Jeffrey Owens of the OECD's 
Centre for Tax Policy and Administration explained that "Low tax 
alone does not classify any place as a tax haven, the key thing 
is to have effective exchange of information."  Bermuda has 
focused on the TIEAs to prove its position that it is not a tax 
haven. 
 
 
 
Bermuda acts to avoid "tax haven" label 
 
 
¶3. (U)  As of April 2009, Bermuda had only three Tax Information 
Exchange Agreements (TIEAs), but it rapidly implemented the 
OECD's standard by signing nine agreements in two months so that 
by June, Bermuda had moved on to the "white list."  Minister of 
Finance Paula Cox stated that "Bermuda is not a tax haven.  The 
OECD has stated that in relation to tax matters, the only 
distinction to be made between jurisdictions is on the basis of 
whether or not they are cooperative.  Bermuda is cooperative and 
has now concluded 12 information exchange agreements."  The OECD 
expects countries to continue to negotiate more agreements after 
they have reached the minimum 12 required TIEAs as it is 
interested in seeing how these agreements work in practice and 
seeing real change. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) As of October 21, 2009 Bermuda has signed 18 TIEAs with 
the United States, Australia, United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway, 
Sweden, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Finland, Ireland, 
New Zealand, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and 
Aruba.  Finance ministry officials stated that these agreements 
had been in the works for several years but Bermuda had failed 
to meet the April 2009 deadline.  (Bermuda executed its first 
TIEA in 1986 in a treaty between the United States, the United 
Kingdom, and Bermuda.)  Finance Ministry Permanent Secretary 
Donald Scott explained to the Consul General on October 23 that 
Bermuda had to get its legislative framework for the TIEAs in 
place.  Bermuda first liaised with the UK in order for the 
Government of Bermuda to engage directly with OECD members. 
(Note, Bermuda is not a member of the OECD.) Bermuda also 
accelerated its effort to conclude TIEAs by creating a unit to 
deal with treaty matters.  Scott noted that Bermuda has other 
TIEAs in the pipeline with Canada, Spain and Portugal. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Scott also cited as evidence Bermuda is a cooperative 
jurisdiction its active involvement since 2003 as a member of 
the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF), a regional 
body that is an associate member of the Financial Action Task 
Force (FATF).  CFATF seeks to implement common countermeasures 
to address the problem of criminal money laundering and tax 
cheating.  Bermuda also enacted the Anti-terrorism (Financial 
and Other Measures) Act in 2004, the Financial Intelligence

Agency Act in 2007 and the Proceeds of Crime (Supervision and 
Enforcement) Act in 2008 to enforce the island's financial 
regulatory system.  In 2009, Bermuda successfully lobbied to 
become joint vice-chairman of the Steering Group of Global Forum 
of the OECD.  Bermuda sought this position to demonstrate its 
bona fides as a cooperative jurisdiction in international tax 
matters as well as to gain a position of influence in the future 
direction of international tax cooperation matters. 
 
 
 
Comment 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) This progress is a demonstration of Bermuda's 
commitment to meeting the OECD's requirements and staving off 
any label or image as a "tax haven."  During this recession, 
Bermuda`s officials, international companies and public are 
focused on possible legislation targeted at tax havens that 
could threaten the international business activity in Bermuda, 
which is critical to its economic success.  The move puts 
Bermuda in the company of such nations as Argentina and the 
British Crown dependencies and ahead of rival jurisdictions such 
as the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Switzerland and 
Turks and Caicos.SHELTON
