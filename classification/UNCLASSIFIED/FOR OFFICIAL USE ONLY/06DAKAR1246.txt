(SBU) On May 18, 2006, the Embassy received a diplomatic 
note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning 
Senegal's election to and attitude toward the UN Human 
Rights Council.  An informal embassy translation of the 
note follows: 
 
Begin text.  "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Republic of Senegal presents its compliments to the 
Embassy of the United States of America in Dakar and has 
the honor to request that the Embassy transmit to the 
American government the Senegalese leadership's sincere 
thanks for the United States' support for Senegal's 
election to the UN Human Rights Council on May 9 in New 
York. 
 
"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs requests that the Embassy 
convey the Senegalese Government's recognition that the 
U.S. decision to support Senegal again underscores the 
excellent, friendly and cooperative relations that exist 
between the two countries. 
 
"Perfectly understanding the importance of this election, 
Senegal will endeavor to work with the United States and 
other Human Rights Council members to make the Council an 
effective body for the protection and promotion of human 
rights and fundamental liberties. 
 
"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Senegal thanks the Embassy of the United States in Dakar 
for its willingness to transmit this message and seizes 
this occasion to renew its highest regards."  End text.
