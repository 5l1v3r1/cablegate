SUBJECT: PERU PERPLEXED BY ECUADORIAN MARITIME COMPLAINT 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Peru's MFA is perplexed by recent news reports that 
the Government of Ecuador (GOE) planned to send a formal note 
of complaint for Peru's alleged failure to agree to GOE 
protocol relating to Peruvian naval vessels' passage into 
Ecuadorian territorial waters during upcoming UNITAS naval 
exercises.  (The news reports stated that the GOE would also 
send a note of protest to the U.S.  The initial venue of the 
UNITAS exercises, in waters off Ecuador's coast, has been 
changed due to Ecuadorian demands.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU) MFA Director General for South American Affairs 
Jose Luis Salinas (protect) told us May 7 that, contrary to 
news reports, there existed no dispute in connection with 
maritime boundaries between Peru and Ecuador, and that 
Foreign Minister Garcia Belaunde had reaffirmed this fact in 
public responses to Ecuadorian allegations.  Salinas said the 
MFA had not received any formal note of protest from the GOE, 
saw no justification for it, and doubted that one would be 
forthcoming.  He speculated that Ecuadorian government 
officials had overreacted to the agitations of certain 
sectors within that country and (speaking personally) 
attributed the government's overreaction to inexperience. 
Salinas affirmed that the 1952 Maritime Zone Declaration and 
the 1954 Special Maritime Border Agreement unambiguously 
defined the maritime boundary between Peru and Ecuador.  He 
acknowledged that these agreements fell short of formal 
treaty status, which he averred was a longer term goal of the 
Government of Peru.
