¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The December 17 Forum for Security 
Cooperation adopted the agendas for the March 17-18, 2009 
cyber security workshop and the March 3-4, 2009 Annual 
Implementation Assessment Meeting.  Russia complained that 
South Ossetia still needed natural gas and appealed for 
international efforts to restore pipe line deliveries. 
Georgia said it was completing pipeline repairs in territory 
it controlled.  Delegations are still waiting for further 
instructions on the draft Code of Conduct questionnaire 
update.  End summary. 
 
Natural Gas for South Ossetia 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Russia (Ulyanov) again warned that South Ossetia 
urgently needed natural gas with winter approaching.  Citing 
an OSCE Mission to Georgia spot report (SEC.FR/769/08), 
Ulyanov welcomed news that pipeline repairs on the "Georgian 
side" were in progress.  Thanking "European" delegations, who 
"were not indifferent to the humanitarian crisis," Ulyanov 
urged a pragmatic response not linked to political issues. 
He noted the matter was also under discussion at the Geneva 
talks. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Georgia (Giorgadze) replied it would not predict 
when the pipeline would be operable as its engineers could 
not access "the other side" in South Ossetia.  Giorgadze 
thanked the U.S. and Canada for the draft decision in the 
Permanent Council that would dispatch OSCE inspectors to 
South Ossetia to inspect the pipeline, adding that Russia was 
blocking the decision.  Georgia welcomed international 
assistance to restore the pipeline. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Ulyanov countered that Russia actually had proposed 
amendments, still under consideration.  He offered to report 
favorably to Moscow on any Georgian request for assistance in 
restoring gas deliveries.  Russia, he reported, has spent 
over ten billion rubles in reconstructing infrastructure in 
South Ossetia damaged during the August war. 
 
AIAM and Cyber Security Agendas 
------------------------------- 
¶5. (SBU) The agendas for the 2009 Annual Implementation 
Assessment Meeting, to be held March 3-4, and the March 
17-18, 2009 cyber security workshop, were adopted without 
discussion, the U.S. joining consensus per guidance (ref A). 
 
Code of Conduct 
--------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Belarus rejected as unnecessary the language from 
the Helsinki Final Act proposed by Denmark and Sweden 
(FSC.DEL/188/08) as a supplement to its own edit 
(FSC.DEL/186/08) of preamble para 3 in the draft decision on 
an update of the Code of Conduct questionnaire 
(FSC.DD/14/08).  Denmark reserved the right to make further 
comment.  Other delegations are still waiting for further 
instructions. 
 
U.S. Defense Planning Submission 
 
USOSCE 00000317  002 OF 002 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The U.S. Vienna Document 1999 defense planning 
submission for 2008 was distributed (FSC.EMI/460/08) per 
guidance (ref B). 
 
Melange 
------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) The "Group of Friends of Melange" met informally on 
December 16.  The OSCE Secretariat reported tenders were 
invited on the OSCE melange project in Ukraine on 15 
December.  The suspense for bid submission is 16 March, with 
a visit to the top two priority sites by interested firms 
planned in mid-February.  The project would be the largest 
yet attempted by the OSCE, involving up to 16,000 tons of 
melange.  The first phase of the project envisions the 
elimination of 3,000 tons of melange at a budget of 3.1 
million euros.  The melange project in Montenegro was 
completed in late November, with the last of the toxic 
chemicals destroyed at the SABAK plant in Sweden.  Melange 
and related materials in Albania are ready for shipment, but 
no transportation solution has been found to date. 
 
Finnish Valedictory 
------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Finland (Turunen and Kangaste) welcomed France as 
the incoming chair of the FSC.  Delegations, including Russia 
and the U.S., praised Finland for its chairmanship, noting 
the additional demands of serving as CiO, including 
preparation for the Ministerial Conference.  France (Lebedel) 
will present its work plan in January 2009 after consulting 
with the other FSC Troika members, Finland and Georgia, and 
the new CiO, Greece. 
 
Next Meeting 
------------ 
 
¶10. (U) The next meeting on January 21 will be the first of 
the 2009 winter session.
