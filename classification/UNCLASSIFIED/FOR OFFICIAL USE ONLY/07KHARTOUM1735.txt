DEPLOYMENT AMIDST SECURITY CONCERNS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Chinese Embassy Defense Attache Colonel Dong Jian 
Dong told poloff November 6 that, starting November 7, the 
first of eleven flights using IL-76 aircraft will begin to 
arrive in Nyala.  Over a period of ten days, the flights will 
transport equipment and supplies for the construction of the 
Chinese engineering company's portion of the UNAMID camp for 
Sector III.  Beginning November 10, three flights using 
AN-124 aircraft (too large for any airport in Sudan outside 
Khartoum) will fly into Khartoum International Airport 
transporting heavy construction equipment.  (Note: Dong did 
not explain how the heavy equipment would be transported to 
Nyala, though it was clear that this would be a challenge.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Dong said he expected that by November 30 the first 
tranche of 135 construction engineers will arrive.  The 
initial tranche will erect a camp for the remainder of the 
315 Chinese soldiers.  He estimated that construction of the 
Chinese camp will take two to three weeks, but would be 
dependent on the arrival of materials from Port Sudan.  He 
anticipated construction would be completed by late December, 
but expressed concern about possible delays.  &The port is 
too small to quickly unload the materials and it will take 
five to seven days to move items from Port Sudan to Nyala.8 
 
¶3. (SBU) Once all 315 engineers are in place, the Chinese 
will construct a &supercamp8 for the rest of the Hybrid 
force, which will be located 11 kilometers north of Nyala. 
Dong said it will take six months to construct the entire 
supercamp, though here again he predicted that logistics 
would be a problem that could cause further delays.  The 
first detachment comes with 60 days of rations, but after 
that UNAMID is to supply food for his troops and construction 
materials for the supercamp. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Dong said UNAMID promised him the engineering company 
would have "adequate protection," provided by Sector III,s 
Nigerian Battalion contingent.  He said the 315 Chinese 
engineers includes 40 force protection troops, although he 
hopes for 40 more internal security troops at a later date. 
Dong expressed concern about the ability of the Nigerian 
battalion to provide adequate security, given their lack of 
experience on the ground in Sudan, their need for armored 
personnel carriers (APCs), and their lack of communications 
equipment.  He said that UNAMID Sector Headquarters still 
lacks radio capability to communicate with troops in the 
field.  "The Nigerians who are to protect the engineers do 
not have adequate protection themselves.  If we have no 
protection, there will be no construction." 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The imminent deployment of the Chinese 
engineering company is a positive development.  Given Sudan's 
reliance on China for economic and political support, the 
Sudanese are unlikely to obstruct their equipment and 
materials at the port.  However the apparent lack of 
preparation by DPKO for UNAMID deployment, as shown by 
serious gaps in communication capacity and logistics 
planning, is troubling and is not a good sign in the early 
stages of deployment.  Moreover security at the supercamp, 
which is currently more isolated and therefore exposed, will 
be a challenge and will require round-the-clock protection to 
prevent attacks and looting. The Chinese unit will especially 
present an inviting target to various rebel groups because of 
the perceived cozy relationship between Beijing and the 
Khartoum regime. Keeping the Chinese company protected and a 
continuing part of the UNAMID operation has obvious political 
advantages. End Comment
