REF: STATE 97313 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points to Jaime Acuna, 
Deputy Director of the MFA's Office of Multilateral Affairs, 
and Olivia Cook, Third Secretary, of the same office, on 
September 16.  Chile agreed that, in principle, individual 
countries should not be allowed to block country-specific 
statements.  However, Acuna felt that the best approach to 
resolving this issue would be to improve or clarify the 
process by which the Convening Group makes decisions. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Chile would not feel comfortable publicly 
criticizing nations who block country-specific resolutions. 
Acuna noted that he had just returned from a posting to South 
Africa and that the country is an "authentic democracy" and 
should be allowed to make its own foreign policy decisions. 
He also noted that both South Africa and India were large 
countries with a major influence on world events, in 
comparison to small Chile.  Finally, Acuna stated that 
conserving Convening Group unity should be a major goal. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Chile is eager to support the Community of 
Democracies (CD) and expects to participate in the democracy 
and development working group.  Due to the size of the 
country and its diplomatic corps, Chile finds it difficult to 
second officials to international organizations such as the 
CD Secretariat or UN Democracy Fund. Cook noted that Chile 
had contributed to Democracy Fund efforts to publish the 
Diplomat's Handbook in the past.  Acuna said that Chile would 
"definitely" make a contribution to either the Secretariat or 
the Democracy Fund in 2009, but he was uncertain which 
organization Chile would support and said that the 
contribution might not be very large.
