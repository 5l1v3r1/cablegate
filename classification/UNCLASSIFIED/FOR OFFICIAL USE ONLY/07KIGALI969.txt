REF: SECSTATE 145641 
 
Â¶1. (U) On October 23 PolOff met with Ben Rutsinga, Director 
for International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, to deliver reftel demarche on UN General Assembly 
Third Committee resolutions.  Rutsinga was receptive to U.S. 
request to take a stand against no-action motions and 
generally supportive of country-specific resolutions, 
especially concerning Iran and North Korea.  Rutsinga said if 
the Rwandan delegation found itself encouraged to vote 
otherwise as part of an African Union block, it would 
consider abstaining.  He reiterated Rwanda's support for the 
resolution against rape as an instrument as a state policy. 
Rutsinga said he will pass Third Committee resolution 
information on to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who must 
then consult with the Cabinet.  He said he will report back 
to the Embassy with the Government of Rwanda's response, but 
did not give a timeline for doing so.
