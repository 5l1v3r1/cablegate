SUBJECT: UN REQUESTS 607 AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT AMISOM 
 
REF: USUN 13 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On February 5, USUN received a letter from the UN 
Secretariat on logistical support to the African Union 
Mission to Somalia (AMISOM).  The letter, which has been 
transmitted by email to the Department, requests agreement in 
principle from the USG to conclude a 607 agreement that would 
allow the UN to reimburse the U.S. for assistance provided 
through the current USG contract with DynCorp.  The UN has 
told us that they do not expect us to revise our contract 
with DynCorp to expand the range of services provided.  They 
expect that the total value of the contract may increase, 
however, if additional troops deploy. 
 
Recommendation and action request: 
 
¶3. (SBU) USUN recommends that we agree to the UN's proposal 
and use negotiations over a 607 agreement as an opportunity 
to press the UN for prompt reimbursement for payments to 
DynCorp and for an expedited UN contracting process.  USUN 
therefore requests Department permission to deliver a 
diplomatic note to the UN conveying our acceptance of its 
proposal.
