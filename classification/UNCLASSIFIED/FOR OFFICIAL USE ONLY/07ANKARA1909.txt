SUBJECT: Update on PKK Violence (July 16-23, 2007) 
 
REF: ANKARA 1840 and previous 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) From July 16-23, 2007, four security officials were killed, 
including two killed in action (KIA) and two in IED explosions. Six 
security officials were wounded in action (WIA) due to an IED 
explosion. 
 
¶3. (U) During this same period, three PKK terrorists were killed in 
action, seven were captured, and three surrendered. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported two clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists in southeastern Turkey during the reporting 
period.  Security forces unearthed at least seven PKK shelters/caves 
and seized booby-trapped land mines; other explosives, including A-4 
and TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; hand grenades; pistols; 
night vision binoculars; TV sets; satellite antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. (U) On July 17, a group of PKKers raided a marble mine in Hani, 
Diyarbakir Province and took cell phones and other belongings of the 
workers. 
 
¶6. (U) On July 23, a civilian was injured when ammunition belonging 
to the PKK and abandoned in a field in Guclukonak, Sirnak Province, 
was accidentally detonated. 
 
¶7. (U) Activity as reported by TGS website:
