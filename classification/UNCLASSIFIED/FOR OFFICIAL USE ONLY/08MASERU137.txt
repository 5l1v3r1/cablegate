REF: STATE 44903 
 
¶1. (U) In response to reftel, post knows of no dissidents from 
un-free nations who are living in exile or seeking asylum in the 
Kingdom of Lesotho.  Post has confirmed this with Lesotho's 
Commissioner of Refugees at the Ministry of Home Affairs. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post notes the case of one Cuban doctor who sought and 
received resettlement benefits in the United States, citing a 
desire not to return to an un-free Cuba.  This individual, 
however, is no longer a resident of Lesotho.
