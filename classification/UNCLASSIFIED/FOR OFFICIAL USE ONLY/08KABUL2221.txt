SUBJECT: IEC SHOWS VOTER REGISTRATION PROCESS TO THE PRESS 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The Independent Elections Commission (IEC) on 
August 16 hosted a press conference on its plans for voter 
registration.  Independent Ariana TV provided the most 
substantial coverage, including footage of the IEC's 
demonstration of "average" Afghans registering to vote.  RTA 
television station also broadcast the event. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The IEC's Chief Technical Officer Dr. Najafi used 
his remarks to delineate the role of the IEC, as well as to 
provide detailed information on the phases and process of 
voter registration.  Najafi noted that the IEC has a mandate 
to make technical decisions on elections, but not political 
decisions. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The demonstration of registration was smooth and 
the IEC's video of it likely will prove an effective voter 
outreach tool.  Five IEC staff played the roles of 
registration center workers, three were political observers, 
and seven were model voters.  The process is in two steps. 
One center worker questions the voter to establish eligbility 
to register, then takes the photos.  Next, a second worker 
questions the voter to gather information to complete the 
registration form, then prepares the laminated card 
containing the photo and a fingerprint. The center's director 
handles voters who lack proof of identity or present other 
difficulties. The first "voter" received his registration 
card in 13 minutes, including the time required to print the 
photos.
