¶1.  (SBU) This report provides an update on developments in Brazil 
regarding the H1N1 flu outbreak. 
 
NOTEWORTHY DEVELOPMENTS: 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Consular Section Sao Paulo is receiving early reports that 
a visiting American citizen has passed away in Rio Grande do Sul 
State.  H1N1 is the suspected, but unconfirmed, cause of death.  ACS 
officers are actively trying to confirm details of the case. 
 
NEW REPORTED CASES: 
 
¶3.  (SBU) As of June 23, 2009, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has 
confirmed 452 cases of the H1N1 virus spread throughout 19 of the 
country's 26 states and the federal district: Sao Paulo (217 cases), 
Rio de Janeiro (48 cases), Santa Catarina (40 cases), Mato Grosso (3 
cases), Minas Gerais (59 cases), Tocantins (4 cases), Rio Grande do 
Sul (28 cases), Alagoas (1 case), Bahia (4 cases), Ceara (1 case), 
Federal District (14 cases), Espirito Santo (8 cases), Goiais (4 
cases), Maranhao (1 case), Parana (9 cases), Paraiba (2 cases), 
Pernambuco (1 case), Rio Grande do Norte (1 case), Sergipe (4 
cases).  The rate of spread of the virus throughout the country has 
been accelerating, though fortunately it remains relatively mild. 
 
BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT'S RECENT ACTIONS: 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On June 22nd the Brazilian National Sanitary Vigilance 
Agency (ANVISA) announced new measures to be adopted in ports and 
airports nationwide. Among these measures is the implementation of a 
traveler's health declaration for people traveling from MERCOSUL 
countries. These passengers will be required to present this form 
upon entry into Brazil.  Airlines will also be obligated to provide 
a list of passengers presenting with symptoms upon arrival.  On June 
23, Brazilian Minister of Health Jose Gomes Temporao recommended 
that people over sixty, children under two, pregnant women, men and 
women with diabetes, chronic lung or kidney illnesses, and 
immunodeficient patients should delay travel to the United States, 
Canada, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, and Australia due to the high rate 
of spread of H1N1 within these countries. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Minister Temporao also stressed that compliance with local 
health officials is critical while emphasizing that Brazil is not 
experiencing sustained human-to-human transmission of the H1N1 
virus.
