Statement By The President Of The United Nations Security 
Council On The Situation In The Middle East: 
 
The Security Council stressed the urgency of reaching 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East.  Vigorous diplomatic 
action is needed to attain the goal set by the international 
community -) lasting peace in the region, based on an 
enduring commitment to mutual recognition, freedom from 
violence, incitement and terror, and the two-state solution, 
building upon previous agreements and obligations. 
 
In this context the Security Council recalls all its previous 
resolutions on the Middle East, in particular resolutions 242 
(1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002), 1515 (2003), 1850 (2008), 
and the Madrid principles.  The Security Council also noted 
the importance of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. 
 
The Security Council encourages the Quartet,s ongoing work 
to support the parties in their efforts to achieve a 
comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East. 
 
The Security Council reiterates its commitment to the 
irreversibility of the bilateral negotiations built upon 
previous agreements and obligations, and calls once again on 
the parties to resume negotiations to resolve all outstanding 
issues, including all core issues, without exception. 
 
The Security Council further calls upon the parties to 
fulfill their obligations under the Performance-Based 
Roadmap, refraining from any steps that could undermine 
confidence or prejudice the outcome of negotiations. 
 
The Security Council calls on all State and international 
organizations to support the Palestinian government that is 
committed to the Quartet principles.  It calls for assistance 
to help develop the Palestinian economy and build Palestinian 
institutions in preparation for statehood. 
 
The Security Council encourages tangible steps towards 
intra-Palestinian reconciliation, including in support of 
Egypt,s efforts, on the basis of the Quartet principles and 
as expressed in the 26 November 2008 Arab League resolution, 
and consistent with Security Council resolution 1850 (2008) 
and other relevant resolutions. 
 
The Security Council welcomes the Quartet,s consideration, 
in consultation with the parties, of an international meeting 
on Middle East peace in Moscow in 2009.
