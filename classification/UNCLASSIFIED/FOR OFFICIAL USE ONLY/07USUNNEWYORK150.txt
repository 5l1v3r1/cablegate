SUBJECT: SECURITY COUNCIL CONDEMNS TERRORIST ATTACKS IN IRAQ 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  The Security Council adopted a press statement 
February 22 condemning recent terrorist attacks in Iraq, 
including the chlorine gas bombing of February 21 (text in 
para 5).  This step concludes a series of recent Council 
press statements condemning terrorist attacks in Lebanon 
(February 13), Iran (February 15), and India and Pakistan 
(February 20). 
 
¶2.   (SBU)  Ambassador Sanders presented the U.S. proposal, 
noting it had the support of the Iraqi mission.  While all 
delegations supported the U.S. initiative, the discussion of 
the text flushed out member views on the situation in Iraq. 
Russia and France, supported by China, South Africa and 
Indonesia, objected to an explicit reference to the Baghdad 
Security Plan, arguing that they could not endorse a policy 
which had not been presented to the Council.  The Qatari 
PermRep commented that the picture so far of the BSP is 
"gloomy."  In subsequent negotiations among experts, the 
Qatari representative also tried to delete the reference to 
"terrorist attacks" in favor of a general condemnation of the 
violence in Iraq, arguing that sectarian and ethnic violence 
did not constitute terrorism.  The Indonesian delegation 
unsuccessfully sought to delete or sideline the reference to 
the MNF-I. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The Russian PermRep also took the opportunity to 
argue that it was time to introduce a timeline for the 
withdrawal of international forces, stating that the violence 
is based on opposition to a foreign presence.  He added that 
there is a need for greater emphasis on a "broad" internal 
political dialogue and national reconciliation.  The Italian 
PR, citing instructions from Rome, also argued for language 
emphasizing the need for dialogue.  USUN, with support from 
the UK mission, urged the focus of the statement remain on 
the security threat to Iraq. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The PermReps of Qatar and Panama observed that a 
mere press statement was an insufficient Council response to 
the grave security situation in Iraq.  There was some debate 
whether to tie the statement to a specific attack.  Most 
delegations concluded, however,  that limiting the press 
statement to one attack would not accurately represent the 
pattern of violence in Iraq. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Text of press statement follows:   The members of 
the Security Council are following with concern the situation 
in Iraq and condemn all terrorist attacks, including the 
recent chlorine gas and other bombings in and around Baghdad, 
which have resulted in the death and injury of many innocent 
Iraqi civilians, and others. 
 
The members of the Security Council acknowledge the efforts 
of the Iraqi Security Forces and the Multinational 
Forces-Iraq, whose members are also being targeted in ongoing 
attacks.  The members of the Security Council extend their 
condolences to all of the victims and their families. 
 
The members of the Security Council urge an end to the 
violence in the country and the redoubling of efforts to 
allow fulfillment of the goals of relevant UN Security 
Council Resolutions, in particular Resolution 1546 (2004) and 
most recently Resolution 1723 (2006), to help meet security 
and stability needs, and express their hope that the efforts 
of the government of Iraq will contribute to bringing 
security and stability to the country.  The members of the 
Council reiterate the Council's call upon Member States to 
prevent the transit of terrorists to and from Iraq, arms for 
terrorists, and financing that would support terrorists. 
 
The members of the Security Council reaffirm the need to 
combat terrorism in all forms and manifestations and by all 
means, in accordance with international law.  End Text.
