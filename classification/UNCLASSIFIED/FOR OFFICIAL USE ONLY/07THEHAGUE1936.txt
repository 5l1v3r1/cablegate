(SBU) On October 24, Poloff delivered reftel points to Gertie 
Mulder, MFA Director for South America.  According to Mulder, 
Bolivia has agreed to abide by UN resolutions on Iran.  For 
that reason, the Dutch MFA's Iran desk does not believe a 
demarche to Bolivia is necessary, and Mulder agreed.  Poloff 
offered to follow up with more detail from the texts of the 
various Bolivian statements, to clarify the scope of Bolivian 
errors.  Mulder agreed to consider that information.
