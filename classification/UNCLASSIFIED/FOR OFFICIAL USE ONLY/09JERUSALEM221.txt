SUBJECT: GAZA HUMANITARIAN UPDATE - FEBRUARY 2 
 
REF: JERUSALEM 216 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Kerem Shalom crossing, the Karni conveyor 
belt, and Nahal Oz fuel transfer station are open on February 
¶2.  Water and sewage services in Gaza remain limited.  The 
power station reduced its power output on January 31 due to a 
lack of sufficient fuel.  The internal distribution of 
medicine and supplies has been chaotic and slow, according to 
WHO contacts.  Contacts reported that Hamas paid January 
salaries to an estimated 23,000 employees in Gaza.  Gaza 
banks continue to experience a lack of liquidity, as the 
PMA's January 7 request to the GOI for the transfer of 
currency remains outstanding.  End summary. 
 
Crossings 
--------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) February 2:  Crossings are partially open. 
Logistics contacts estimated that approximately 110 
truckloads will move through Kerem Shalom crossing, while 
70-80 truckloads of wheat and grains are expected to enter 
via Karni's conveyer belt.  Nahal Oz is open to industrial 
fuel for the power plant and some cooking gas.  Erez is open 
to certain international travelers only, and Rafah was open 
to 5-10 truckloads of medical equipment. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) February 1:  Around 115 truckloads entered Kerem 
Shalom and 90 truckloads of wheat came through Karni's 
conveyer belt.  Around 240,000 liters of industrial fuel for 
the power plant and an estimated 50 tons of cooking gas 
passed via Nahal Oz fuel transfer station.  Rafah terminal 
was open to five truckloads of medical supplies.  Erez was 
open for international travelers with special co-ordination 
only. 
 
Health 
------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) WHO contacts in Gaza reported on February 2 that 
some Gaza hospitals and clinics have not received certain 
donated medicines supplies over the last week due to a lack 
of organization in the public health sector. 
 
Water and sanitation 
-------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) OCHA contacts in Gaza reported on February 2 that 
most Gaza families have running water from the mains in their 
homes, but that nearly 30 percent of Gaza's population has 
water from the mains less than two hours/day.  Gaza water and 
sanitation sector officials reported a shortage of water 
tankers for distributing water to communities.  They also 
said that there are 43 projects in Gaza awaiting materials 
(e.g. pumps, pipes, fittings, motors, etc.).  IDF operations 
in Gaza caused approximately USD six million in damage to the 
water and sewage networks and destroyed 180 agricultural 
wells, according to sector officials. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) OCHA contacts in Gaza reported that that cement in 
Gaza is in short supply and selling for the equivalent of USD 
75/bag.  Those contacts confirmed that the GOI has not 
allowed significant cement imports to Gaza since June 2007, 
and that the lack of construction materials has made most 
repairs to major infrastructure unfeasible. 
 
Electricity/Fuel 
---------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The power plant is generating 30 MW on February 2, 
according to plant management.  Contacts said that plant 
output dropped from 70 MW to 30 MW on January 31 due to fuel 
shortages.  (Note: The plant burns 140,000 liters/day of 
industrial fuel when generating 30 MW.  End note.)  Gaza 
contacts said on February 2 that most Gaza City homes have 
6-12 hours/day of electricity, while the remaining areas in 
Gaza experience 12-18 hours/day, as they are less dependent 
on power plant output. 
 
Hamas and PA salaries 
--------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The Hamas-controlled government in Gaza paid the 
January salaries of an estimated 23,000 employees, according 
to UN contacts in Gaza on February 2.  The payments, 
reportedly made in US dollars, were distributed in post 
offices throughout Gaza on January 30-February 1.

¶9.  (SBU) Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) contacts 
reported on February 2 that banks in Gaza face the same lack 
of liquidity as in December 2008, when the PMA was forced to 
shut them down for a week.  The PMA said banks in Gaza will 
not be able to disburse salaries for 77,000 PA employees 
without an additional infusion of currency from their West 
Bank branches.
