-------------- 
MISSION POSTURE 
--------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) As of 2200 local, January 31, the Mission moved to 
consolidate all official Americans due to continued concern 
of imminent rebel attacks on N'djamena.  Embassy officials 
and eligible family members are consolidated in three 
locations: at the Embassy compound; the American school 
compound; and, for various DoD personnel, at one of their 
residences. We have adequate fuel, water and food supplies 
and electricity and water systems are currently operational. 
Communication, including IVG lines, radio, and cellphones/SMS 
are fully operational. We had two very useful TELCONS with 
Operations Center Director. The Embassy has also disseminated 
three cleared warden messages to the American community and 
continues to be in contact with as many Amcits as possible.

GENERAL OVERVIEW 
---------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) As of 2200 local, N'djamena is outwardly calm, with 
normal traffic patterns and security presence. There have 
been no reports of any disturbances.  The airport is open. 
Air France Paris/NDjamena/Paris flight for tonight is 
scheduled to depart as usual. Chad's land borders are also 
open for departure. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to French defense attach, the rebels are 
currently approximately 70 miles outside of N'djamena. Rebel 
leaders have decided to attack the capital rather than engage 
the government outside the city. The French reportedly "have 
no plans to rescue" Deby for now. French also plan to 
reinforce with two parachute companies from Libreville, 
Gabon.  Estimated time of arrival in N'djamena is 0300 on 1 
February. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A World Bank contact told PolOff that rebels and the 
Chadian government are currently in "tentative" quiet 
negotiations and if the rebels' demands are not met, heavy 
fighting should be expected within the next day. 
 
¶5. (SBU) USAID/OFDA Kirsti Lattu reported from Abeche that as 
of 2000 local, all UN employees were told to prepare to 
evacuate, as there are reports of a third rebel group who 
have moved across the border and are heading towards Abeche. 
There continues to be no major confrontation with the 
government.
