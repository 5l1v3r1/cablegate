¶1.  There have been no reports incidents of anti-Semitic acts 
against Jews or Jewish property in Yemen since July 1, 2003. 
 
¶2.  There are between two and three hundred Jews remaining in 
Yemen.  The ROYG issued a press release in June accusing Jews 
living in northern Yemen of backing the rebellion in Sa'da 
(ref B).  The statement, carried by the local media, was 
retracted by the government shortly thereafter.  The Yemeni 
media is prone to conspiracy stories involving Jews and 
Israel.  For example, articles this month claimed that Israel 
was poisoning Yemenis through pesticides used on qat, a 
widely used narcotic. 
 
¶3.  All non-Muslims are banned from running for Parliament. 
This policy of the General Election Committee was reached 
after the ruling GPC party tried to run a Jewish candidate.
