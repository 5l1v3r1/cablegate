SUBJECT: COTE D'IVOIRE:  PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PUBLIC 
SCHOOL TEACHERS LAUNCH UNLIMITED STRIKE 
 
REF: (A) ABIDJAN 428 (B) ABIDJAN 633 (C) ABIDJAN 549 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary:  On June 15, primary and secondary public 
school teachers began unlimited strikes to protest the lack 
of government response to their demands for a housing 
allowance and salary increases.  The government did not 
respond to a three-day strike held from June 6 to June 8 by 
the Collective of the Unions of the Education and Training 
Sector (Collectif des Syndicats du Secteur Education et 
Formation -- CSSEF).  As a result, CSSEF and the Movement of 
Primary School Teachers for the Defense of their Rights 
(Movement des Instituteurs pour la Defense de leurs Droits -- 
MIDD) have launched their strike and shut down all public 
primary and secondary schools in Abidjan and an estimated 90% 
of schools in the government-controlled south.  MIDD and 
CSSEF launched their strikes on same day, something that 
leaders from both organizations disingenuously claim to be 
coincidental.  End Summary 
 
¶2.  (U) Key Players:  MIDD was created in September 2005 and 
applied for union status in April 2006 but has not yet been 
granted this status.  Its strike is therefore technically 
illegal.  The movement claims membership of 32,000 out of 
35,000 primary public school teachers.  The MIDD has launched 
two other strikes:  the first from March 13 to 17, and the 
second from April 3 to 11 (ref A), which were suspended after 
talks with the Prime Minister's office.  During those 
negotiations, the government rejected all of MIDD's demands. 
CSSEF is a collective of primary and secondary school unions, 
from which MIDD is excluded.  As MIDD counts the overwhelming 
majority of primary school public teachers among its members, 
CSSEF is composed mostly of secondary school teachers. 
 
¶3.  (U) Demands:  MIDD's primary demand is for a housing 
allowance equivalent to USD 200 per month.  The CSSEF has 
multiple demands:  an upgrade in pay scale for those 
secondary school teachers who have advanced degrees, 
immediate payment for teachers who grade exams (currently, 
teachers who grade exams must wait until the following 
academic year to be paid) and, like MIDD, a housing allowance 
for primary school teachers. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  It is highly unlikely that the 
simultaneity of the two strikes is coincidental.  That CSSEF 
has included MIDD's principal objective of a housing 
allowance to its own list of demands even though CSSEF's 
members are almost all secondary school teachers, suggests a 
de facto alliance between the two organizations.  The 
strikes, when added to the university professors' strike 
resumed on June 13 (ref B), mean that the vast majority of 
public school students in the government-controlled south 
cannot attend classes and are at risk of having to repeat the 
scholastic year.  Moreover, private primary and secondary 
school owners have not withdrawn their threat to shut down 
their institutions unless they receive the unpaid subsidies 
which are still owed to them by the government.  (Ironically, 
students in the New Forces-controlled north, which had 
suffered hardship from a lack of accredited teachers and the 
inability to take end-of-year exams since the rebellion began 
in 2002, are now better off scholastically than their 
counterparts in the south.)  The combination of frustrated 
students (and parents) with time on their hands is a recipe 
for further unrest.
