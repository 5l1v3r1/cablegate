in New York State.  She arrived in Beijing on May 11 Continental 
Airlines #89 from Newark and sought medical treatment on May 14, 
after reportedly having had limited exposure to the public before 
then.  China CDC and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences

influenza A/H1N1 positive. She is now reported to be in stable 
condition receiving treatment in isolation at Ditan Hospital. 
Premier WEN Jiabao visited Ditan Hospital on May 17, conversing with 
her via video link.

male, a Chinese citizen, went on a tour in Canada and the United 
States in late April. On May 13, he arrived in Hong Kong via Korea, 
and on May 14 developed flu-like symptoms. On May 15, he traveled 
from Hong Kong to Guangzhou by train and was found to have a fever 
when he arrived at Guangzhou East Station. He was then sent to 
Guangzhou Number 8 People's Hospital for treatment and testing, and 
Guangdong CIQ, Guangzhou CDC and Guangdong CDC test results all 
showed positive for influenza A/H1N1 nuclear acid. A sample from the 
case has been sent to China CDC for final confirmation.

asking hotels to implement certain H1N1 prevention and control 
measures, including monitoring guests' temperatures.  According to

ALLEGED TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS FOR FOREIGN TEACHERS AT A UNIVERSITY 
------------------ ------------------------- ------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) In Jilin Province, an AmCit teacher at Changchun University 
of Science and Technology alleged that the school informed 
non-Chinese national teachers not to leave Changchun or meet with 
people from out of town. School officials assured ConGen Shenyang 
that no blanket travel restriction has been placed on the foreign 
teachers, noting that the foreign teachers were advised to avoid 
crowded places and notify the school of any travel plans with 
contact information (a policy already in place prior to the H1N1 
outbreak outside of China). 
 
 
CHANGES TO CHINA'S VISA APPLICATION PROCESS

¶5. (SBU) Despite official MFA statements to the contrary, Post 
continues to receive reports from private sector contacts about new 
requirements or restrictions on processing visa applications for 
travel to China.  Moreover, several USG delegations that had been 
planning to travel to China in coming weeks have been told by 
Chinese hosts to postpone their trip to an unspecified later date.
