SUBJECT: COTE D'IVOIRE:  TEACHERS WITHHOLD EXAM 
RESULTS IN PROTEST OVER PAYMENT 
 
REF: ABIDJAN 789 
 
¶1.  (U)  As of August 18, public secondary school teachers in 
the government-controlled zone are refusing to release 
results from the baccalaureate exam (required for entry to 
university) until they are paid for grading them.  (Note: 
Exams in the rebel-controlled zone are scheduled to start 
August 28.)  The teachers are demanding a total of 461 
million CFA (922,000 USD).  Teachers began grading the exam 
on August 7, and results were supposed to be published August 
¶15. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On July 18 the teachers announced that they were 
resuming an earlier strike (ref A).  Prompt payment for 
proctoring and grading the exams was one of their key 
demands.  On July 24, the day the strike was supposed to 
resume, the Ministry of Education announced the formation of 
a committee -- comprised of representatives of the Ministries 
of Education, Finance and Labor, and the teachers' unions -- 
to address the teachers' demands.  On the strength of this 
action, the teachers called off their strike.  The exams 
proceeded normally.  Then on August 7, the day the teachers 
started grading the exams, they once again urgently raised 
the pay issue.  The Ministry responded that they would be 
paid on September 15.  The teachers then accused the Ministry 
of using delaying tactics, and they announced that they would 
withhold the results of the exams until they are paid. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Sources in the Collective of Unions of the 
Education/Training sector  8Collectif des Syndicats du 
Secteur Education-Formation," (CSSEF) tell us they believe 
the Ministry of Education is now attempting to bypass them by 
sending the exam papers to private school teachers in other 
cities of the government-controlled south for grading. 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  The teachers realize that once the 
results of the exams are released they will have no more 
leverage to force the Ministry to address the pay issue or 
any of their other demands until after the school year starts 
again this fall.  For now, they are hanging tough. 
  End Comment.
