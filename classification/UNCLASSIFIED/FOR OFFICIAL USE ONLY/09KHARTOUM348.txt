SUBJECT: KHARTOUM EAC CONVENES ON MARCH 12 
 
¶1.  (SBU) CDA Fernandez convened the Emergency Action Committee 
(EAC) on Thursday, March 12, to review the current security 
situation in Sudan after Authorized Departure was announced on March 
¶10.  The DCM, POL, MGT, DLO, RAO, USAID, IMO, RMO, PAO, OBO SSM, 
CONS, and RSO were in attendance. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) After a week of inciting and threatening rhetoric directed 
in Government of Sudan controlled media against the U.S. in general 
and the 13 expelled International Non-Government Organizations in 
particular, the CDA reported the regime has reduced the intensity of 
its public statements.  As the EAC continues to evaluate the 
post-ICC security environment, it is concerned about the March 11 
kidnapping of five Medecins Sans Frontieres-Belgium (MSF-B) 
humanitarian workers in a remote town on the North and West Darfur 
border.  One of the two Sudanese kidnapped in the group was released 
on March 12.  Those remaining include a Canadian, French, Italian, 
and Sudanese   A Canadian EmbOff reported to the RSO that the 
kidnappers were motivated by the heated rhetoric in Sudanese 
President Bashir's recent speeches.  In exchange for the hostages' 
release, the kidnappers are demanding that the ICC rescind the 
arrest warrant and that MSF-B pay a two million Sudanese pound 
(900,000 USD) ransom. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The EAC also discussed an alleged threat against Sudanese 
opposition leader Hassan al-Turabi who was released from prison 
earlier this week.  Turabi's family members have expressed concern 
about Turabi's safety following his release from prison to Sudanese 
security and police officials.  The family has also appealed for 
assistance to the UK and other Western embassies.   In a 
widely-distributed e-mail, Turabi's family members state their 
concern that Islamic extremists within the regime will assassinate 
Turabi for his public statements recommending that a Muslim leader 
be handed over to an "infidel's court" (i.e. the International 
Criminal Court.) The EAC concluded that it has no way to confirm 
whether such concerns are valid and whether such a plot by the 
regime or others exists against Turabi. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) While senior-ranking GOS officials are reluctant to meet 
with EmbOffs or take Washington calls, security and law enforcement 
channels remain open and productive.  Shortly after the EAC meeting, 
National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) liaison informed 
EmbOff that they had arrested the Sudanese national who called-in a 
telephone bomb threat to the Embassy on March 10.  NISS officers 
said they would provide information from their preliminary 
investigation to the Embassy on Sunday, March 15. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The Mission remains on a heightened level of alert while 
reminding all personnel to maintain a low profile.  Four employees 
and two family members will be leaving on authorized departure 
between March 14 and 16.
