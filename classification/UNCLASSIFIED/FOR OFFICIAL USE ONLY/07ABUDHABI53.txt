SUBJECT: URGING GULF ENGAGEMENT AT PARIS DONORS' CONFERENCE 
FOR LEBANON - UAE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 3663 
 
¶1. (SBU) On several occasions, Ambassador has urged UAE 
Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan (AbZ) to 
have the UAE to demonstrate a high level of support for 
Lebanon both by sending a ministerial level delegation to the 
meeting and by providing a strong show of financial support 
for Lebanon's political and economic stabilization.  AbZ told 
us this week that he plans to attend the donor's conference 
(though probably not for the entire conference).  In 
addition, MinState Finance Dr. Mohammed Khalfan bin Kharbash 
will attend.  AbZ did not give any figure for a possible UAE 
financial pledge. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 15, Econchief raised the issue with 
MinFin A/US for Revenue and Budget, Khalid Al-Bustani, who 
also declined to give any estimate of potential UAE 
contributions.  He confirmed that the Ministry of Finance had 
examined Lebanon economic reform program and prepared a 
report for the MFA on it.  He said that - personally - he 
thought it looked like a very professional plan.  On January 
16, Ambassador briefly discussed the donor's meeting with 
Arab Monetary Fund Director General Dr. Jassem Al-Mannai, who 
will also attend the conference.  Al-Mannai confided that he 
had also been unable to get a figure from the UAE.  He 
speculated that the UAE would calculate its contribution 
based on the size of other GCC contributions.  He said that 
he believed that the UAE's pledge would be substantial. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Lebanese Prime Minister Sinora is visiting the UAE 
on January 16-17.  Post will provide a read out as soon as 
the visit ends.
