¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, emboffs discussed with Dutch DCM Roelof 
Buffinga on January 27 preparations for the February 9-11 
Nuclear Security Summit Sherpa meeting in The Hague. 
Buffinga noted that the Dutch embassy had received reftel 
demarche a week earlier.  Given conflicting schedules, he 
asked to deliver the demarche by himself as soon as possible; 
emboffs agreed.  Buffinga later reported on January 27 that 
he delivered the demarche to MFA Arms Control Director Rodica 
Radian-Gordon, who already possessed reftel's note verbale. 
According to Buffinga, Radian-Gordon said the Israeli 
delegation has registered and made hotel reservations for the 
Sherpa meeting in The Hague. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Polmiloff confirmed with Radian-Gordon on January 
29 delivery of the demarche.  Radian-Gordon said she passed 
the demarche to GOI Nuclear Security Summit Sherpa Gil Reich 
and sous-Sherpa Ronen Shaul.
