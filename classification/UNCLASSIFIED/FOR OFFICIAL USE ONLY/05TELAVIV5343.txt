SUBJECT: DISENGAGEMENT SITUATION REPORT, AUGUST 30, 2005 
 
This is a joint message from Embassy Tel Aviv and Consulate 
General Jerusalem. 
This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The IDF continues to make steady progress in 
implementing the GOI disengagement.  Hamas and Fatah 
personnel clashed near Rafah.  Otherwise few notable security 
incidents took place in the last twenty-four hours.  The GOI 
appears to have agreed to a phased handover of settlement 
areas in Gaza, thus easing PA security concerns.  Egypt's 
Intelligence Chief has proposed a six-month interim solution 
to the Rafah crossing problem.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS 
 
-- IDF continues to concentrate on the removal of settlers' 
possessions, demolition of houses, and removal of IDF 
infrastructure. 
 
-- Twelve reburials are scheduled to take place on August 30 
as part of the transfer of the Gush Katif cemetery to Israel. 
 Three soldiers killed in the Gaza are among those who will 
be reburied. 
 
--Palestinian press reported August 30 that the Palestinian 
Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) will prepare a general 
census of all assets remaining in the Palestinian settlements. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) SECURITY SITUATION 
 
GAZA: 
 
-- Hamas and Fatah Clash:  Armed clashes between Hamas and 
Fatah personnel took place in Haya Salam area of Rafah at 
0230 hours August 30, according to Palestinian sources. 
Fatah members tried to prevent Hamas from putting up posters. 
 Two Fatah members were injured in the exchange of fire. 
 
-- Weapons Tunnel:  IDF uncovered a weapons smuggling tunnel 
along the Rafah borderline with Egypt and blew it up. 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) PALESTINIAN REACTIONS 
 
-- The Director General of the Palestinian Company for 
Economic Development (established by the Palestine Investment 
Fund to take over the settlement greenhouses) told the 
Palestinian press that his company would be ready to 
immediately start using the greenhouses post-disengagement. 
Crops from 1000 greenhouses would bring in around USD 70 
million in revenue, he said. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) GOI POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
-- Phased Handover Likely:  The GOI has expressed interest in 
handing over each evacuated settlement on an individual basis 
to the PA, rather than in a single, one-day transfer, 
according to Israeli press reports.  Concerns had been raised 
about the PA's ability to establish control over former 
settlement areas in the event of a rapid and uncoordinated 
IDF departure. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) BORDER CROSSINGS/HUMANITARIAN ACCESS 
 
-- Crossing Proposal:  Egyptian Intelligence Chief Omar 
Suleiman, currently visiting Israel, Gaza and the West Bank, 
has proposed that, after the IDF withdrawal from Gaza, the 
GOI should maintain control over the entry of people and 
goods into Gaza for an interim period of six months, 
according to Israeli press reports and post contacts.  Under 
Suleiman's proposal, people and goods would be able to leave 
Gaza via Rafah with no Israeli supervision.
