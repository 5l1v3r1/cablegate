SUBJECT: ETHIOPIA: EQUIPMENT REQUEST FOR DARFUR 
PEACEKEEPING TROOPS 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  AmEmbassy Addis Ababa supports the application of 
peacekeeping (PKO) funds toward the Ethiopian National 
Defense Force (ENDF) to equip ENDF troops heading to Darfur 
to serve as peacekeepers.  The GOE has requested that the 
U.S. provide night vision goggles, bulletproof vests, tents, 
and sleeping bags for 5,000 troops. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Ethiopia is a key strategic partner of the U.S. in 
the Horn of Africa and the reinforcement of the United 
Nations/African Union Peacekeeping force in Darfur is a high 
U.S. policy priority in the region.  Similarly, the United 
States has long sought to improve the ability of 
Ethiopia--Africa's second largest contributor of troops to UN 
peacekeeping operations--to participate in regional and 
international peacekeeping missions.  The provision of this 
equipment to the ENDF will allow the military to fill a 
critical shortage and accelerate their deployment to Darfur.
