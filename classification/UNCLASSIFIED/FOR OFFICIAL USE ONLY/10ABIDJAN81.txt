REF: ABIDJAN 77 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  A slightly revised Independent Electoral 
Commission (CEI) was sworn-in by the President of the 
Constitutional Court on February 25, with former Foreign Minister 
Youssouf Bakayoko as its new president.  The opposition has 
reportedly called a halt to further demonstrations and is 
finalizing its participation in the reshuffled government announced 
on February 23.  Completing the electoral list will be the CEI's 
first and most important task. End Summary 
 
 
 
ELECTORAL COMMISSION RECONSTITUTED 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Speculation about who would head the new electoral 
commission was rampant in the days leading up to the February 25 
announcement, with many convinced that a Forces Nouvelles 
representative would prevail given the current enmity among the 
political parties.  The selection of Youssouf Bakayoko, a long-time 
PDCI loyalist and Foreign Minister until February 12, was 
completely unexpected.  Bakayoko is widely respected for his 
professionalism, a trait it is hoped he will bring to the CEI more 
visibly than his predecessor, Robert Mambe.  Four new vice 
presidents were also announced: Eby Ndabia, a former prefect, will 
represent the FPI (presidential party); Jacob Anaky, brother of the 
MFA founder, will represent that small opposition party; Mamadou 
Coulibaly Gnenema, formerly the CEI treasurer, moves to being vice 
president for the Forces Nouvelles; and Amadou Soumahoro, the 
former Commerce Minister, will represent the RDR. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) The new leadership team was sworn-in the evening of Feb. 
25 along with the twenty-five members of the CEI who were retained 
per the agreement brokered by Pres. Compaore during his most recent 
visit to Abidjan. (ref A)   The oath was delivered by 
Constitutional Court president Yapo Germain Yanon, a symbolically 
important choice made by the government to reinforce the authority 
of this court over the commission.  The commission will resume work 
the week of March 1 and is expected to announce that challenges to 
the provisional electoral list will be accepted for an additional 
three week period.  Individuals who names have not been "validated" 
will also have an additional three weeks to come forward with proof 
of citizenship. 
 
 
 
NEW GOVERNMENT STILL NOT COMPLETE 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U)  According to local media, the opposition continues talks 
with Prime Minister Soro about their participation in the new 
government, which was formed on February 24 with eleven slots 
reserved for the opposition, but no ministers actually named 
(reftel).  However, a spokesman for the opposition coalition told 
the press that they would stop calling on their supporters to 
conduct demonstrations to protest President Gbagbo's February 12 
dissolution of the government.  The PDCI, RDR, and UDPCI should 
announce their representatives in the new government by Monday. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Comment:  The election of Bakayoko, a well-regarded 
career diplomat (former Ambassador to Germany and Switzerland), 
sends a positive signal that, while party affiliations are 
important, ability also played a crucial role in the selection of 
the new CEI president.  Embassy had a very productive and friendly 
relationship with him in his role as Foreign Minister and expects 
to continue to have good access to him.   His selection, which we 
understand Pres. Gbagbo had to agree to, should also reassure the 
opposition that the presidency can support a CEI president  from 
another party, as long as he operates in a professional, 
non-partisan manner.  The reconstitution of the CEI should enable 
the electoral process to regain the momentum it has lost since the 
beginning of the year.  Their first task will be to complete work 
on the preliminary electoral list and publish a final list within a 
reasonable timeframe. If the CEI succeeds in doing this, their

credibility will increase, as will hope that an election this year 
may truly be possible.
