SUBJECT: EL SALVADORAN MINISTER OF DEFENSE RECEPTIVE 
TO PARTICIPATION IN PRT INITIATIVE 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. At a May 24 meeting with Iraq 
Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO) and Acting 
Deputy Chief of Mission Daniel Speckhard and National 
Coordination Team (NCT) Director Greg Bates, El 
Salvadoran Minister of Defense Alejandro Romero 
indicated El Salvadors continuing interest in 
supporting a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) 
based in Al-Kut, provincial capital of Wasit Province, 
and location of El Salvadors Multi National Force- 
Iraq troop contingent. Romero, accompanied by the 
Chairman of the El Salvadoran General Staff and 
members of the El Salvador National Assembly, said the 
PRTs focus on enhancing the ability of Iraqi 
provincial governments to provide local services was 
as 
an excellent fit for the humanitarian and 
reconstruction-oriented focus of the El Salvadoran 
armed forces mission in Iraq. Romero also indicated 
that further consultations with the National Assembly 
in San Salvador would be needed before a final 
commitment could be made. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) A/DCM and IRMO director Speckhard and NCT 
Director Bates praised El Salvadors record in Iraq, 
noting their contributions were particularly well 
received among Coalition partners and Iraqis in the 
South Central provinces of Najaf, Babil and Wasit. The 
PRT program was then briefed to MinDef Romero, 
Assemblymen Mario Ponce, Ernesto Angulo and Rolando 
Herrarte, as well as other staff members, focusing on 
its role as a mechanism for transitioning from 
military-led to primarily civilian-led coalition 
reconstruction efforts in Iraq. Specifics of potential 
El Salvadoran participation were not discussed in 
detail, however A/DCM and NCT director emphasized that 
the flexibility of the PRT initiative would allow for 
r 
a wide spectrum of El Salvadoran engagement in either 
support or leadership roles. 
 
¶3. (SBU) MinDef Romero related that the capacity- 
building and reconstruction focus of the PRTs aligned 
well with the overall humanitarian mission of El 
Salvadors armed forces in Iraq. Romero noted that El 
Salvadoran participation in Iraq had a positive impact 
on the domestic image of El Salvadors armed forces. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Both A/DCM and MinDef Romero agreed that the 
upcoming six months are a crucial opportunity in 
building a stable Iraq with responsive and transparent 
provincial governments. Upcoming provincial elections, 
in particular, present an excellent chance to increase 
engagement with provincial council members, governors, 
and directors general in Wasit province.  According to 
MinDef Romero and National Assembly member Ernesto 
Angulo, El Salvadors recent history of conflict and 
reconstruction highlighted the importance of 
responsive local governments and the provision of 
of 
basic services as a method of supporting peace and 
stability. MinDef Romero, in closing, indicated that 
he was extremely interested in continuing El 
Salvadors participation in the Coalition and PRT 
effort, and would consult with the National Assembly 
immediately about doing so.
