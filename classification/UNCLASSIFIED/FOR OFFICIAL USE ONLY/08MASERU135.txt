¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan 
Tsvangirai arrived in Maseru aboard a private plane on May 13 
for an afternoon of meetings with senior GOL officials.  The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement that said the 
visit "follows the announcement of presidential elections in 
Zimbabwe... in which there did not emerge a winner with 
sufficient majority to lead the government."  Tsvangirai was 
scheduled to depart Lesotho immediately following his afternoon 
meetings, but no further details on his discussions with the GOL 
were available by COB May 13.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Morgan Tsvangirai, Zimbabwean presidential candidate and 
leader of primary opposition party Movement for Democratic 
Change (MDC), landed at Moshoeshoe International Airport at 
approximately 3:00 pm on May 13 aboard a private aircraft, 
accompanied by four MDC officials.   Tsvangirai and his 
delegation, in an official GOL motorcade, proceeded to Maseru's 
Qhobosheaneng Government complex for a meeting with senior GOL 
officials. 
 
¶3. (U) After Tsvangirai's arrival, the MFA announced the visit 
with a brief statement: "The leader of the Zimbabwe Opposition 
MDC, Mr. Morgan Tsvangirai, is scheduled to arrive at Moshoeshoe 
I Airport at 2 p.m. today to have a consultative meeting with 
The Right Honorable the Prime Minister, Mr. Pakalitha B. 
Mosisili, on 13 May, 2008.  The visit follows the announcement 
of presidential elections in Zimbabwe on Friday 2 May, 2008 in 
which there did not emerge a winner with sufficient majority to 
lead the government."  According to GOL contacts, however, 
Deputy Prime Minister Archibald Lehohla stood in for PM 
Mosisili, who apparently fell ill prior to the meeting. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  MFA contacts told Emboffs that Tsvangirai 
intended to depart Lesotho immediately following his afternoon 
meetings with the GOL.  Although no details on the discussions 
were available by COB May 13, we will use imminent opportunities 
with local participants in the visit to assess the GOL's 
reaction to MDC's regional campaign to garner support for 
Zimbabwe's political opposition.  End Comment.
