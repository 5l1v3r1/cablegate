SUBJECT: Afghanistan: GOA Confirms Request for Japanese 
Assistance for Kabul Power 
 
Ref:  A) Kabul 1206 and previous B) State 48110 (Notal) 
 
Sensitive But Unclassified. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Pursuant to Ref B, Econ Counselor raised the 
issue of securing Japanese assistance to the Afghan energy 
sector in separate meetings with Senior Adviser to the 
President Nadiri and Minister of Economy Shams.  In the 
April 22 meeting with Shams, who chairs the Inter- 
ministerial Commission on Energy, the Minister reported 
that he had made a formal written request to the Japanese 
Ambassador in Kabul for assistance to strengthen the city?s 
electricity supply. 
 
¶2.  In the lead up to the April 29-30 Afghanistan 
Development Forum (ADF) and the May 1 Joint Coordination 
and Monitoring Board meeting, Econ Counselor discussed the 
need for stepped up energy sector support from Japan and 
other donors in a preparatory meeting with Nadiri and ANDS 
Coordinator Adib Farhady.  Per septel, President Karzai 
subsequently highlighted the energy sector in his opening 
remarks at the ADF as the ?top priority sector? for donor 
attention.  Nadiri?s opening remarks also cited electricity 
as the GoA?s number one donor priority.  Minister of Energy 
and Water Ismail Khan chaired the session on energy at the 
ADF, where both he and Nadiri mentioned Kabul power supply 
as an emergency priority issue. 
 
¶3.  Economic Counselor also took advantage of the presence 
at the ADF of Japanese Ambassador Ogawa, the Tokyo-based 
coordinator for Afghanistan Reconstruction, to engage Ogawa 
and make the case directly for Japanese energy sector 
participation.  Ogawa agreed it is an important sector, but 
was noncommittal. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  We believe Japan?s Ambassador to the 
U.S. may not have been closely following the discussion in 
Kabul when he implied that the GOA has not raised the Kabul 
power supply issue as a priority with Japan.  In recent 
months, the GOA has raised few issues with such regularity 
and at such high levels with the donor community.  Shams? 
letter confirms that the Japanese were formally approached 
for assistance.   While the Ref B exchange presents an 
encouraging opening, we believe that even if the Japanese 
come through with some assistance, they will not be able to 
do so in the urgent timeframe we face for placing the order 
for Kabul generation capacity.  The tender process has 
already begun, with the issuance of a request for 
quotation.  The due date for the bids is May 15.  The 
target date for placing the order is May 31.  If and when 
the Japanese come through with a contribution, we can 
envision at least two ways of dealing with it, with the 
second option probably being the more realistic: 
 
-- since the payments for the generators will be made in 
installments through 2008, we could conceivably use the 
Japanese money to make future progress payments; 
 
-- we can encourage the Japanese to direct assistance for 
related electricity needs in Kabul, e.g., distribution 
system upgrade so that the power from the generators and 
from the Northern Electrical Power Systems (NEPS) can be 
absorbed efficiently.
