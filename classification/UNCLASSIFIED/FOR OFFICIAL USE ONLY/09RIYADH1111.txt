SUBJECT:  SORCERY CALLING SCAM TARGETS 
 
¶1. (SBU) A/GSO received a call at 17:45 on August 25 from 
an unknown number with country code 221 (the country code for 
Senegal).  Upon returning the call, a man purporting to know her 
said in Egyptian colloquial Arabic that he "wanted to help her." 
"You are in danger -- your life is in danger," he said, explaining 
that someone had used sorcery (saher) to put a curse on her and that 
she needed to listen to what he had to say.  "I know you are a Saudi 
woman and believe me, you need my help -- I am only calling to help 
you.  Do you understand what I am saying?" he repeated. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Saudi contacts in the transportation and tourism 
industries later told A/GSO that these phone calls are a widespread 
phenomenon in Saudi Arabia.  Scammers call Saudi numbers at random 
and leave missed calls.  When someone calls back, the scammer speaks 
with urgency about a sorcerer who has put a life-threatening curse 
on the caller.  The scammer then offers to counter the curse and 
solicits the caller's credit card information to pay for their 
sorcery services. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Financial risk for the scammer reportedly is low, 
as they do not pay for the calls themselves.  Scammers select for 
gullibility and financial solvency by only engaging callers who take 
the time and resources to return the international call. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) More common scams like the Nigerian 419 fraud 
letter also target Saudis via fax and email.  While the motivator in 
advance-fee fraud is financial, this phone scam cleverly targets 
widespread Saudi belief in, and fear of, sorcery.
