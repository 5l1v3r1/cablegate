¶2. (U) Article 44 of the Cambodian Constitution says "the (state's) 
right to confiscate properties from any person shall be exercised 
only in the public interest as provided for under the law and shall 
require fair and just compensation in advance."  The Law on 
Investment also provides that "the Royal Government of Cambodia 
shall not undertake a nationalization policy which adversely affects 
the private property of investors." 
 
¶3. (U) Cambodian laws are not uniformly applied and enforcement is 
often biased towards individuals with connections to the government.

expropriation claims involving U.S. persons and the Cambodian 
government through July 1, 2009.
