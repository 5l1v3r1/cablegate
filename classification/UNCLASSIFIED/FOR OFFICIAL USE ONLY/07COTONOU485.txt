REF: STATE 90022 
 
(SBU) Charge spoke on July 2 with Benin's Minister of State for 
National Defense, Issifou Kogui N'Douro, to request that Benin 
consider a troop contribution to the hybrid AU/UN force for Darfur. 
N'Douro stated that Benin was unable to consider such a troop 
contribution because he simply did not have enough troops.  N'Douro 
said that with PKO battalions currently deployed in Cote d'Ivoire 
and DR Congo, it was beyond the means of the Beninese Armed Forces 
to deploy a third battalion on a peacekeeping assignment.  N'Douro 
said that Benin remained committed to providing its troop 
contributions in the two on-going missions, but that he would only 
be able to consider another PKO if one of those two battalions was 
no longer needed where it is currently deployed.
