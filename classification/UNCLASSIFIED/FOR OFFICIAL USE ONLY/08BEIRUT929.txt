LEBANESE WOMEN TO ENTER THE POLITICAL ARENA 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU)  In a visit to Beirut, former U.S. Ambassador and Harvard 
University John F. Kennedy school professor, Swane Hunt, met with a 
cross-section of talented andsuccessful Lebanese women active in 
business, civil society and politics.  Although she recognized the 
importance of the current role of Lebanese women in all fields, she 
stressed the need to increase women's presence in the political 
arena and encouraged Lebanese women to run for office.  Immediately 
after meeting and listening to Hunt's empowering lectures, several 
Lebanese women began putting her message into concrete ideas for 
action.  End Summary. 
 
HUNT MEETS WITH LEBANESE WOMEN ACTIVE IN 
BUSINESS, POLITICS, AND CIVIL SOCIETY 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) During her brief visit to Beirut on June 19-21, former U.S. 
Ambassador Swanee Hunt met with a number of Lebanese women active in 
business, politics, and civil society.  This included participants 
of the upcoming MEPI Women Political Leaders program and other 
MEPI-funded programs, the State Department co-sponsored 2007 Women 
in Business Summit, FORTUNE/State Department/Vital Voices mentorship 
program, as well as members of the Legal and Business Fellowship 
Program (LBFP), and local organizations such as the Lebanese League 
of Women in Business (LLWB), and the Arab Women's Legal Network 
(AWLN) Lebanon Hub. (Note:  Some LLWB and AWLN members have attended 
USG-sponsored training.  End note.)  All the participants were 
impressed by Hunt's wide-ranging experience as a diplomat, 
professor, politician, prolific writer, composer, photographer, 
specialist in women's issues, and advocate for social change, gender 
parity, and the alleviation of poverty. 
 
"LET WOMEN RULE" IS MAIN 
FOCUS OF HUNT'S MESSAGE 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Throughout the day on June 20, Hunt combined a formal 
presentation entitled "Let Women Rule," which she presented at the 
Lebanese American University's (LAU) Women Studies' Department, with 
informal talks and conversations at a coffee discussion event hosted 
by Charge Sison and a lunch that gathered around 25 prominent 
Lebanese business women.  At each event, Hunt highlighted the 
importance and need for greater female involvement in society and 
gave a number of examples from her own experience showing how the 
role of women had improved outcomes, for example in conflict 
resolution. 
 
¶4. (SBU) However, Hunt's main message revolved around the minimal 
female presence in world politics, the reasons that pushed women 
away from politics and more into civil society and NGO work, and 
ways to encourage greater female involvement in the political arena. 
 Regarding the specific case of Lebanon, some women raised the need 
to amend existing legislation that discriminates against women (such 
as the inability of Lebanese mothers to grant Lebanese citizenship 
to their children) and ways to impact mostly male legislators.  Hunt 
reasserted that such laws cannot be properly amended unless women 
participated in public policy making, thus the need to get a greater 
number of women elected to parliament. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Regarding the current debate on electoral reform in Lebanon 
and the proposed electoral quota for women, Hunt mentioned that 97 
countries in the world have a gender quota for parliamentary 
elections.  And although she echoed many women's opposition to such 
a quota, including Lebanese women, Hunt pointed out that there is no 
country with more than 25 percent female participation in parliament 
that does not have a gender quota.  Therefore, Hunt strongly 
encouraged Lebanese women to run for office and to create groups in 
support of these candidates. 
 
¶6. (U) Hunt further emphasized her message during an exclusive 
interview with English-language newspaper The Daily Star on June 20. 
 In it, Hunt expressed her optimism that gender reform in Lebanon 
could be brought about by even a small number of organized women. 
She called on women to "force" their way into the political system, 
because the system will not welcome them in. 
 
OTHER WAYS OF EMPOWERING 
WOMEN ALSO DISCUSSED 
-------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Hunt also discussed other areas for empowering women, 
 
BEIRUT 00000929  002 OF 002 
 
 
including ways for Lebanese women to get a better education, thus 
increasing and improving job opportunities, which would in turn 
allow greater female autonomy.  She encouraged women to always aim 
high, whatever their objective, warning that they would "run out of 
time" if they waited for the political and societal environment to 
change before taking action.  She also recommended that women send a 
flow of editorials on a daily basis to create public awareness of 
the positive impact of women in parliament and gain support for 
fundraising and votes. 
 
NEW SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT IMMEDIATELY 
TRANSLATED INTO CONCRETE IDEAS FOR ACTION 
-------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Immediately after meeting with Hunt at the Charge's 
residence, one of the participants submitted a draft proposal for 
the group to form a "women's coalition" to empower women in 
politics.  One of its first objectives would be to call for a 53 
percent women quota in the voting ballot. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Meanwhile, the most recent participant of the 2008 
FORTUNE/State Department/Vital Voices mentorship program told us 
that she was planning to set up a Middle East Mentoring program, an 
NGO that would tap top women managers and university graduates in 
the Middle East and match the latter for training with top women 
managers. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) Hunt's visit helped draw attention to the important role 
that Lebanese women already play in society, while motivating them 
to do more, as demonstrated by the immediate and overwhelmingly 
positive reaction to her presentations.  Embassy has already 
followed up by setting up an e-mail exchange with the participants, 
and will continue to reach out to them in an effort to promote more 
political activism from a potentially very powerful group of 
prominent Lebanese women.
