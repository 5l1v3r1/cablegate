talking points to Labor Ministry Director of External Affairs 
Ricardo Aguilar and Reftel A and B talking points to 
Arramenta Torres in the MFA's Office of Candidacies and 
Quotas.  Aguilar received talking points before departing for 
the International Labor Organization (ILO) Conference, but 
could not be reached for comment. Torres referred a final 
decision on Cuba's candidacy to Aguilar in Labor, and said 
that a final decision on either the proposed 2006-2007 ILO 
budget or on Cuba's candidacy for the ILO Governing Body 
would not be made until early this week.
