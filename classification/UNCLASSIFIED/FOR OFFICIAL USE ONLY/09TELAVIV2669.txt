¶1. (SBU)  Summary:  Representatives from Rafael Advanced 
Defense System's Missiles and Netric-Center Warfare Division 
confirmed receipt of the five turret and five logic laser 
harnesses in April 2009.  According to Rafael Deputy Director 
for Security and Information Security Director Moshe 
Greenshtein, one logic laser harness and three turret 
harnesses have been used to manufacture one Litening infrared 
targeting and navigation pod, and two Reccelite airborne 
reconnaissance pods. Greenshtein said the Reccelite pod would 
be sent to Colombia in a matter of days, while he anticipated 
shipment of the Litening pod to Colombia in February 2009. 
The remaining turret and laser logic harnesses remain stored 
in a Rafael controlled-access facility.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Polmiloff visited Rafael Advanced Defense System's 
Missiles and Netric-Center Warfare (NCW) Division on December 
¶8.  Rafael is a GOI-owned company; it was established as part 
of the MOD more than 60 years ago and was incorporated in 
¶2002.  Based in Leshem, Israel (approximately 30 minutes east 
of Haifa), the Missiles and NCW Division employs 
approximately 2,660 of Rafael's 5,500 employees.  The 
Missiles and NCW Division focuses on intelligence and 
netric-center warfare, intelligence, surveillance and 
reconnaissance (ISR), air superiority, air-to-surface 
precision guided weapons (PCWs), solutions for the "future 
warrior," combat suits for helicopters, and multipurpose 
tactical missiles.  Kobi Fogler from the MOD's Directorate of 
Security Defense Establishment (MALMAB) also was present 
during the site visit. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Rafael Deputy Director for Security and Information 
Security Director Moshe Greenshtein and his team briefed on 
the turret (TA1K7000C-E95) and logic laser (TAUK6600A-E95) 
harnesses used for Litening infrared targeting and navigation 
pod and Reccelite airborne reconnaissance pod.  Greenshtein 
confirmed that Rafael received the harnesses in April 2009. 
Per the purchase order, he noted that the harnesses had been 
ordered from CICOIL Corporation (Valencia, CA) via Rafael 
USA, INC.  Greenshtein also presented copies of the 
declaration, export license, invoice, and packing slip in 
support of the license application. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Greenshtein noted that of the five logic laser 
harnesses (TAUK6600A-E95), Rafael still possessed four in its 
warehouse.  According to Greenshtein, Rafael still possesses 
two of the five turret harnesses (TA1K7000C-E95).  He noted 
that two Reccelite pods containing two turret harnesses will 
be shipped to Colombia in the "next few days."  He 
anticipated shipping a Litening pod containing one logic 
laser harness and one turret harness to Colombia in February 
¶2010. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Greenshtein reviewed Rafael's computer 
accountability and tracking system, which includes serial 
numbers, purchase orders, project numbers, and indicates 
whether a component is a controlled item.  Controlled items 
are logged into this computer system for tracking, marked 
with an end-use sticker, and stored in a secure, 
controlled-access facility.  All Rafael team members working 
on these projects must hold GOI "top secret" clearances. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Greenshtein noted that the computer system tracks 
the project for which the harnesses are intended.  He said 
the production line manager receives a computer-generated 
report daily of components and projects for which they were 
used.  If there is a discrepancy, the report will note that 
the component was used for the wrong project.  Greenshtein 
said his security shop receives the same report weekly for 
accountability purposes.
