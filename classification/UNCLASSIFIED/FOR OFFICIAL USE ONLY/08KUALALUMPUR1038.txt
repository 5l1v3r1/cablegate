(SBU) Poloff conveyed reftel demarche points, seeking 
Malaysia's support for opposing three specific UN resolutions 
directed against Israel and pursuing the reduction of 
one-sided anti-Israel resolutions, to Nur Ayuni Zainal 
Abudin, Assistant Secretary for the UN in the Malaysian 
Foreign Ministry's Multilateral Political Division, on 
November 24.  Ayuni did not provide any immediate feedback. 
We will report back any subsequent response.  Post notes that 
Malaysia has a history of supporting almost all resolutions 
directed against Israel, including three similar resolutions 
that were proposed at last year's UNGA.
