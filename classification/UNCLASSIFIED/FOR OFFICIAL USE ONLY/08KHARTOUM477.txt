SUBJECT: DARFUR IDPs PROTEST CENSUS IN ABU SHOUK CAMP 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  Multiples sources confirmed to emboffs that 
internally displaced persons in Abu Shouk camp near El-Fasher, North 
Darfur organized a protest on March 31 in opposition to the upcoming 
Sudanese census.  Although protests are common in Darfur's many IDP 
camps, this is the first protest directed specifically against the 
census.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U)  On March 31, Rabie Bahar Ad-Din, grandson of Sultan Ali 
Dinar and supporter and focal point of the Fur community called 
emboff, stating that a large protest against the census was 
occurring at the IDP camp of Abu Shouk.  (Note:  Abu Shouk is the 
largest and closest IDP camp to North Darfur's capital of El Fasher 
End Note.)  EmbOff immediately called the United Nation's Department 
of Safety and Security (UNDSS) duty officer who confirmed that a 
protest was ongoing in Abu Shouk and that all UN and international 
personnel were advised to stay away from the camp.  The UNDSS 
officer stated that "it appears as if almost the entire camp is 
participating in the protest," and that Abu Shouk leaders 
specifically instructed the UN to stay away from it. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Ad-Din claimed that many different ethnicities were 
represented at the protests, though the Fur were the overwhelming 
majority.  Meanwhile, Sajo estimated that around 35,000 IDPs 
participated in the demonstration that started at International Red 
Cross hospital at 9:30 and continued throughout the Abu Shouk camp, 
ending at approximately 13:00. Both Sajo and UNDSS representatives 
confirmed that the protests were non-violent. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Sajo reported that the IDPs carried banners with the 
following slogans:  "IDPs should not be counted before they return 
to their homelands;" "IDPS support Abdel Wahid's office in Israel as 
it supports IDPs' concerns;" "We completely refuse the census;" "War 
criminals should be brought to justice immediately;" "The Government 
of Sudan should be serious in solving Darfur's problems;" and "The 
IDPs request non-African protection forces for the IDP camps." 
 
¶5.  (U)  On March 31, Rodolphe Adada, the Joint Special 
Representative of UNAMID commented on the Abu Shouk protests during 
a two-day conference in El-Fasher.  Adada first announced that the 
protests were ongoing, then added that these protests by the large 
Fur population demonstrate the complexity of working in Darfur, 
especially as the United Nations has directed UNAMID to work to 
support the census. 
 
¶6.  (U)  COMMENT:  Demonstrations, marches, and protests are common 
occurrences in Darfur's many IDP camps.  However, the March 31 
protests are particularly significant as they show the complex 
dynamic between Darfur's ongoing crisis and the potential obstacle 
that it presents to implementation of the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement.  Although it cannot be determined at this time if Abdul 
Wahid Al-Nur directed this protest, it is likely.  (Fur leaders 
appeared very skittish when asked about communication with Abdul 
Wahid and his chain of command.)  Nonetheless, all of our Fur 
contacts in Darfur support Abdul Wahid to varying degrees, and even 
if he did not directly order this protest, his opposition to the 
census certainly would have contributed to the protest.  We 
anticipate there will be additional protests in the IDP camps as the 
census approaches, and UNAMID will need to determine whether it is 
safe to facilitate the census in the camps, or leave them out due to 
security considertions.
