SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On May 13, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai 
unveiled his plan to guide the Government of Zimbabwe's (GOZ) 
activities during the next 100 days of the unity government 
at a conference attended by government officials, 
legislators, diplomats, civil society, and business leaders. 
In essence, the 100-day plan is a managerial tool to be used 
in the implementation and execution of the recently launched 
Short Term Emergency Recovery Program.  Present at the launch 
were Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, who gave the key note 
address, Vice President Joice Mujuru, who gave closing 
remarks, Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara, Patrick 
Chinamasa (the only ZANU-PF heavyweight to give a 
presentation) and several ministers and deputy ministers. 
Slated to speak and conspicuous by their absence, were 
ZANU-PF Ministers Ignatius Chombo (Local Government), 
Emmerson Mnangagwa (Defense), Simbarashe Mumbengegwi (Foreign 
Affairs), and Sydney Sekeramayi (National Security).  While 
well intentioned, it was clear that the government lacked the 
funding to carry out the plan.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) The 100-day plan grouped the 32 cabinet ministries 
into five clusters: Economic, Infrastructure, Rights and 
Interest, Security, and Social.  Each cluster is headed by a 
cabinet minister, with three of the five clusters led by 
ZANU-PF ministers and the remaining two by MDC-T ministers. 
In a brief, but well-received opening speech, Tsvangirai 
sought to assert his authority as Prime Minister by calling 
on all cluster heads to report directly to him.  He also 
called on the signatories to the Global Political Agreement 
(GPA) -- an indirect reference to President Mugabe and other 
ZANU-PF obstructionists -- to implement the letter and spirit 
of the GPA to ensure the success of both the 100-day plan and 
the transitional government overall.  Tsvangirai said that 
there was progress on resolving some outstanding issues 
between the parties (ref) and that a statement to that effect 
would soon be issued.  (NOTE:  Subsequent to the 100-day 
roll-out, Tsvangirai was forced to acknowledge that the 
principals had been unable to resolve their outstanding 
issues and would seek a SADC resolution.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶3.  (U) Closing remarks were made by Mujuru who seized the 
opportunity to appeal to the U.S. and the EU to remove 
sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe -- a position also echoed by 
Justice and Legal Affairs Minister Patrick Chinamasa who 
described the targeted measures on Zimbabwe as "illegal." 
There was vocal dissent in the gallery when Mujuru and 
Chinamasa harped on the oft-used sanctions refrain. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Well Intentioned, But Poorly Funded 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Economic cluster leader, Elton Mangoma (MDC-T), 
Infrastructure cluster leader, Theresa Makone (MDC-T), Rights 
and Interest cluster leader, Patrick Chinamasa (ZANU-PF), 
Qand Interest cluster leader, Patrick Chinamasa (ZANU-PF), 
Giles Mutsekwa (MDC-T) on behalf of Security cluster leader, 
Sydney Sekeramayi (ZANU-PF), and Cecil Zvidzai (MDC-T) on 
behalf of Social cluster leader, Ignatius Chombo (ZANU-PF), 
each outlined their priorities and plans.  Consistent across 
all clusters was a lack of budgetary support for the plans, 
and all cluster leaders or their representatives appealed to 
the donor and international community for funding.  The 
following are highlights of the cluster presentations:

Economic Cluster

¶5.  (U) Mangoma focused on raising funds to finance the Short 
Term Emergency Recovery Program, macro-economic stability, 
and public sector reform.  A critical aspect of the cluster's 
mandate is the restoration of public confidence in the 
banking system, and the cluster plans to implement IMF 
recommendations on reforming the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe 
(RBZ).  Public Finance Management System reforms to improve 
government accountability are also high on the cluster 
agenda.  Mangoma spoke of achieving some success in fund 
raising and referred to securing a US$1 billion credit line 
from PTA Bank, Afreximbank and SADC.  China (US$5 million) 
and South Africa (US$30 million) have provided direct 
budgetary assistance.  An increased flow of humanitarian aid 
was also mentioned, totaling US$300 million for the first 
quarter of 2009.  The cluster is geared to attracting foreign 
investment for infrastructure development by using the 
concept of Private/Public Partnerships.  To this end, it has 
put in place investor-friendly policies with the aim of 
rebranding Zimbabwe as a place of sound economic management 
and respect for the rule of law.  To improve the business 
environment, the cluster will seek to create a supportive 
legal and regulatory framework.  A land audit will be 
conducted within the next 100 days to ascertain legal land 
ownership and resolve conflicts over competing claims.  The 
cluster will also undertake a comprehensive reform of the 
public service sectors and parastatal enterprises, but 
parastatal sales may not occur in light of depressed current 
valuations.

Infrastructure Cluster

¶6.  (U) Makone identified energy, water, and public works 
development as key priority areas in need of urgent funding. 
 
--------------------------- 
Rights and Interest Cluster 
--------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (U) Chinamasa stated that his ministry, Justice and Legal 
Affairs, would work to facilitate the constitutional reform 
process, review of media policy, and the setting up of 
independent commissions. 
 
---------------- 
Security Cluster 
---------------- 
 
¶8.  (U) Co-Home Affairs Minister Mutsekwa did not provide a 
Security cluster 100-day plan.  Rather, his presentation 
emphasized the interdependence between security and 
development.  According to the cluster, failure to adequately 
provide the needs of the security forces in terms of 
accommodation, health facilities, equipment, and food rations 
could undermine development. 
 
-------------- 
Social Cluster 
-------------- 
 
¶9.  (U) Zvidzai discussed aligning the Social cluster's 
priorities to the joint scoping mission, which is being 
spearheaded by the European Commission, UNDP, African 
Development Bank and the World Bank.  He acknowledged that it 
would take longer to unlock donor finance through the scoping

mission process which will be followed by a needs assessment 
when conditions allow.  The delay in international funding 
would require a bridge finance facility.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU) While the objectives laid out in the 100-day plan 
are largely salutary, the GOZ lacks the financial means to 
achieve most of them.  The exception is the Rights and 
Interest cluster where expanded media space and judicial 
reform could be accomplished inexpensively -- if the 
political will existed.  What was most notable about the 
launch was who did and did not attend.  Of the five clusters, 
three are headed by ZANU-PF ministers.  Only Chinamasa was 
present.  Sydney Sekeramayi, the Defense Minister and head of 
the Security cluster was absent and there was no explanation. 
 Ignatius Chombo, head of the Social cluster, was absent 
allegedly because he was traveling.  Vice President Mujuru, 
reportedly now close to Tsvangirai, was the lone ZANU-PF 
representative on the dais.  Finally, it is worth noting that 
although the remarks of Chinamasa and Mujuru were largely 
positive and supportive of the 100-day plan, neither could 
resist blaming a large part of Zimbabwe's predicament on 
sanctions.  END COMMENT.
