¶1. (SBU) On October 25, General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) 
Director General Saif Al Suwaidi called FAA Attache to request NTSB 
assistance with the investigation of the October 22 crash of a 
Boeing 707 cargo plan operated by Azza Air Transport.  Al Suwaidi 
asked that the NTSB begin to assist with the investigation 
immediately, as the GCAA has limited capability.  Al Suwaidi noted 
that Investigator in Charge (IIC) Ismail Abdel Wahed has spoken to 
the NTSB (Joe Sedor), but that it did not seem like the NTSB 
assistance with the investigation was forthcoming. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 22, a Boeing 707-330C cargo plan owned by Azza 
Air Transport and leased to Sudan Airways crashed at Sharjah 
International Airport.  (Note: Sharjah is one of the seven Emirates, 
located north of Dubai.  End Note.)  The plane was headed to 
Khartoum but crashed only minutes after takeoff in a deserted 
stretch of land adjacent to the airport. The airplane was almost 
completely destroyed, and all six crew members were killed.  GCAA 
officials immediately responded along with other federal and local 
UAE emergency officials.  DG Al Suwaidi subsequently told the press 
that the GCAA had begun its investigation, but was "inviting the US 
because they are more experienced with investigations of this kind 
with this type of aircraft. So we feel they can be helpful in 
determining the cause of the accident." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post understands that Azza Air Transport was designated by 
the U.S. Treasury Department pursuant to Executive Order 13400 for 
contributing to the conflict in Darfur.  Post understands that NTSB 
support may require Treasury approval or licensing (ref emails). 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The GCAA is working to develop independent investigatory 
body, but does not currently have sufficient capacity to undertake a 
complete investigation.  Post strongly encourages involved 
Washington agencies to try to facilitate the UAE's request for 
assistance. End Comment.
