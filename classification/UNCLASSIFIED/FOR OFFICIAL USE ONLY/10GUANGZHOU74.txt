SUBJECT: U.S. AND CHINA HOLD FIRST PROBABILISTIC SAFETY ASSESSMENT 
WORKSHOP FOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS IN SHENZEN, CHINA 
 
REF: 09 STATE 129517 
 
¶1. (SBU) Officials and nuclear energy experts from the United States 
and China convened in Shenzhen, Guangdong January 20-23 to share 
information and best practices for improving safety in the operation 
of nuclear power plants (NPPS).  The workshop was a key cooperative 
activity that the U.S. Department of Energy and the Chinese National 
Energy Administration (NEA) agreed to organize during a meeting last 
August of the 5th U.S.-China Joint Coordinating Committee (JCC) 
under the Peaceful Uses of Energy Technology (PUNT) Agreement.  As 
the first bilateral workshop organized around the theme of 
probabilistic safety assessment (PSA), the bulk of presentations and 
discussion at the workshop focused on the benefits and diverse 
applications of PSA, a risk assessment methodology that analyzes 
both the magnitude of a potential adverse consequence and the 
likelihood that such a consequence would occur. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The U.S. delegation was led by the Deputy Director of 
Department of Energy (DOE) Office at Embassy Beijing and included an 
official from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and four nuclear 
safety experts employed by U.S. DOE laboratories.  Chinese 
participants included officials from the National Energy 
Administration, the Ministry of Environmental Protection's National 
Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA), experts from the China Nuclear 
Power Technology Research Institute, as well as representatives from 
leading nuclear power companies. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The two sides agreed to a series of potential follow-on 
activities, subject to the availability of resources. These include 
other workshops that would address specific topics identified during 
the Shenzhen workshop and a pilot project at an existing and 
operating NPP in China that would bring together U.S. and Chinese 
technical teams to implement key safety projects. 
 
¶4.  (U) This cable was coordinated with the U.S. DOE delegation that 
attended the workshop.
