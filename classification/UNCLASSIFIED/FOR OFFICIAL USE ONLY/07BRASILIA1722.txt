SUBJECT: BRAZIL: VIEWS ON COALITION AGAINST WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING: 
ILLEGAL LOGGING OUT, GENETIC RESOURCES IN 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, IT IS NOT 
INTENDED FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  Brazilian Ministry of External Relations 
Environment Division Director Coimbra stressed in an August 27 
meeting with ESTH Counselor that Brazil had concerns about the scope 
of the Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking, in particular the 
inclusion of flora, which would include timber.  While adamant about 
wanting to keep "illegal logging" out of CAWT's scope, Coimbra also 
noted Brazil would like to include genetic resources within the 
scope.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  On August 27, ESTH Counselor and ESTH Officer met with 
Fernando Coimbra, the new Director of Brazil's Ministry of Exterior 
Relations (MRE) Environment Division, to discuss the Government of 
Brazil's (GOB) views on the Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking 
(CAWT).  Coimbra stressed that the GOB supported efforts to combat 
illegal trafficking in animals.  He noted that Brazil is often a 
victim of such trafficking due to its rich biodiversity.  Further, 
the GOB had attended CAWT meetings in London and Orlando as an 
observer. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Nonetheless, Coimbra identified two areas of concern 
regarding CAWT's "scope":  "illegal logging" and genetic resources. 
He added that who spoke for CAWT seemed an open question.  The GOB 
had heard differing views from the United States, the Europeans, and 
Australia about CAWT's scope and purpose.  He wanted to know how to 
get a definitive answer on CAWT's scope.  He also sought 
clarification on how CAWT's decision-making process works. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  First, Coimbra expressed serious reservations about 
including flora within the scope of CAWT's work, in particular 
timber.  He commented that "illegal logging" was a "non-starter" for 
the GOB.  He complained that at the CAWT meeting in Orlando there 
had been a side-event on "illegal logging."  (NOTE:  Coimbra 
explained that from the GOB perspective, "illegal logging" is a 
domestic concept defined by national law, and not from outside.  Of 
course, when timber that has been illegally harvested is exported 
from Brazilian territory in contravention to CITES then it could be 
considered "illegal."  While the international community should not 
be characterizing Brazilian logging as legal or illegal, Coimbra 
commented, it certainly could help Brazil through capacity-building 
and strengthening institutions.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Second, after discussing concerns about flora and 
"illegal logging," Coimbra raised the GOB's interest in including 
genetic resources within the scope of CAWT's work.  When asked 
whether the GOB insisted on including genetic resources within 
CAWT's scope, he demurred. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Further, Coimbra noted that the GOB works with others in 
Brazil to combat wildlife trafficking.  He mentioned that the GOB 
collaborates with the Brazilian NGO Renctas in this area.  The 
Executive Coordinator of Renctas, Raulff Ferraz Lima, met with ESTH 
Counselor and confirmed that the GOB collaborates with Renctas in 
anti-trafficking campaign, and further that the GOB had interest in 
joining CAWT but it would have to work through its reservations 
beforehand. 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  Coimbra stated that the GOB did not want to diminish or 
weaken CITES.  He expressed some hesitation that CAWT could in some 
way be undermining CITES. 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  COMMENT.  Absent convincing assurances about keeping 
"illegal logging" outside of CAWT's scope, the GOB appears unlikely 
to upgrade its participation from observer to member.  This task may 
have become more difficult if, as Coimbra indicates, other CAWT 
members are declaring that CAWT has such an expansive scope of work. 
 END COMMENT.
