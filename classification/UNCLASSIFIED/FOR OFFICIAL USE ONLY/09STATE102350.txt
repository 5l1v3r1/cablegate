Reduction Agency (DTRA) has reviewed itemized cost lists and 
bills associated with implementation of the Strategic Arms 
Reduction Treaty (START) (totaling 526,826.76 USD), and 
supporting documentation submitted by the Russian Nuclear 
Risk Reduction Center (RNRRC) for the billable period January 
1, 2009, through June 30, 2009.  Based on this review, DTRA 
is disputing charges totaling 7,996.73 USD and will be 
forwarding a 518,830.03 USD payment to the appropriate RNRRC 
account.  DTRA will also be forwarding an additional 1,803.50 
USD payment to the RNRRC account for previously disputed 
START costs for the earlier billable period July 1, 2008, 
through December 31, 2008 (Refs A and B).  DTRA is also 
seeking confirmation from the RNRRC that bank account 
information provided by the RNRRC to Embassy Moscow 
(DTRO-M/ACI) on July 29, 2009 (Ref C) should be used for 
these and future U.S. START payments.  In order to meet 
Treaty timelines, Embassy Moscow (DTRO-M/ACI) is requested to 
provide the information in paragraph 3 below to appropriate 
RNRRC officials at the earliest opportunity.  END SUMMARY AND 
ACTION REQUEST.
