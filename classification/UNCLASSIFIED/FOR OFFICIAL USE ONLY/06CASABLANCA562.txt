¶3.  (U) On the third anniversary of the May 16, 2003, 
terrorist bombings at five location throughout Casablanca, 
hundreds of people gathered peacefully in the city's 
Mohammad V Square to honor the 33 people killed in the 
attacks.  The participants rejected any demands for 
retribution and instead called for tolerance, unity, and 
peace.  Among those, making an impassioned plea for social 
harmony was Souad Khammal, president of the May 16, Victim's 
Association, who lost her husband and son in the attack. 
Khammal thanked Morocco's King Mohammed VI and the people of 
Morocco for their support of the families of the victims. 
 
¶4.  (U) Echoing these appeals for peace was Abdellah Baha, 
assistant secretary general of Morocco's moderate Islamic 
party, the Justice and Development Party (PJD).  The PJD, 
widely criticized after the bombings because of Islamic 
ties, called on all sectors, public and private, to remain 
"united against terrorism."  Speaking out as well was the 
Party for Socialist Progress (PPS), who reminded the GOM 
that it must remain vigilant in its fight against terrorism 
while keeping a close eye on the problems faced by youth in 
Morocco's slums and rural areas.

Comment

¶5.  (SBU) Casablanca has shown great resiliency since the 
May 2003 attacks and areas like Sidi Mouman, home to the 
majority of the suicide bombers, are now a showplace of new 
constructions and progress.  However, other poor 
neighborhoods here show signs of the same sense of 
dissatisfaction and social exclusion, brought on by poverty 
and unemployment that fostered the fertile breeding ground 
for extremist influence, which enabled the planners to find 
willing participants.  Many locals perceive that in some 
areas of Casablanca conservatism is sharply on the rise, and 
there is concern that the GOM's current efforts to limit 
extremist influence may not succeed.
