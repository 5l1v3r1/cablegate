Â¶1.  (SBU) PolOff on September 22 discussed reftel points on 
the potential Preparatory Committee (Prep Com) meeting with 
Marina Rozic, Head of the  NATO Department at the Croatian 
Foreign Ministry.  Rozic said she would pass on to the 
Croatian Mission to NATO before September 23 our request that

until at least after the October 15 Geneva Conference, 
especially in light of the agreement that there can be "no
