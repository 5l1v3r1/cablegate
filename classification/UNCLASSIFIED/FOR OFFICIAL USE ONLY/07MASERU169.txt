SUBJECT: LESOTHO: IRANIAN COMPLIANCE WITH UNSCR 1737 
 
REF: STATE 23001; MASERU 149 
 
¶1. (U) DCM spoke on March 15 with MFA Acting Principal Secretary 
Thabang Lekhela to express USG views on the IAEA's report on 
Iranian compliance with UNSCR 1737 and next steps (Note: Due to 
ongoing post-election issues in Lesotho, Lekhela was unavailable 
prior to March 15 to discuss UN issues.  The Ambassador 
discussed the Iran issue briefly with FM Tsekoa on March 14, ref 
¶B.  End Note.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Lekhela said that as a "tiny" country, Lesotho is 
totally against proliferation of all weapons, especially nuclear 
arms.  He noted that Lesotho supports "any means" to stop Iran's 
nuclear pursuits, adding that the GOL was discussing internally 
the possibility of a statement or other measures to support 
current efforts within the UN on this issue.  Lekhela observed 
that Iran has proclaimed publicly that it is willing to 
negotiate on this issue, but "everything the Iranian government 
does in practice contradicts this public claim." 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Comment: Although Lehkela echoed similar sentiments of 
other senior GOL officials on proliferation (ref B), Lesotho is 
unlikely to support any effort beyond quiet diplomatic 
negotiations in dealing with Iran on UNSCR 1737 compliance.  End 
Comment.
