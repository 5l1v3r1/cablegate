SUBJECT: IRANIAN GOVERNMENT CONFISCATES KUWAITI TEXTBOOKS 
REFERENCING "ARABIAN GULF" 
 
(SBU) The Iranian government recently confiscated a number of 
Kuwaiti textbooks from an Arab-administered school in Qom, 
Iran, a September 24 article in Al-Watan (local Arabic daily) 
reported.  Citing parents of children attending the school, 
the article said the textbooks were confiscated because they 
contained references to the "Arabian Gulf" as opposed to the 
"Persian Gulf."  The parents complained that delivery of the 
school's textbooks was delayed every year by Iranian 
officials and asked the Kuwaiti government to raise this 
issue with the Iranian government, the article said.  The 
K-12 school is supervised by the Kuwaiti Ministry of 
Education and has approximately 500 Arab students.
