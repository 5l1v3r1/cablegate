¶2. (SBU)  Following FM Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic's visit to 
Afghanistan in April, the MFA has established a small 
committee to consider the ramifications of establishing a 
permanent diplomatic presence in Kabul, MFA Assistant 
Minister for Multilateral Affairs Pjer Simunovic told DCM 
June 9.  This is an important issue for the country given 
that it is about to triple its military presence in 
Afghanistan, he added.
