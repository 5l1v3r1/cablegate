SUBJECT:  CAMBODIAN PM DISMISSES TWO CO-MINISTERS; 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PASSES CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Citing the need for greater 
efficiency in Cambodia's bloated bureaucracy, Prime 
Minister Hun Sen removed two FUNCINPEC officials as co- 
ministers of Defense and Interior on March 2.  (Since 
1993, the PM's Cambodian People's Party and the 
Royalist FUNCNPEC party have shared co-ministers of 
Defense and Interior portfolios, even though the 
FUNCINPEC officials have held little real authority.) 
Also March 2, the National Assembly overwhelmingly 
passed a constitutional amendment proposed by the 
opposition that would permit  formation of a government 
with a 50 percent plus one majority vote in the 
National Assembly, replacing the former 2/3 majority 
requirement.  The latter step is intended to avoid 
extended stalemates after elections, as occurred in 
1998 and 2003.  End Summary. 
 
PM Removes FUNCINPEC Co-Ministers of Interior and Defense 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶2.  (U)  On March 2, PM Hun Sen told reporters he had 
removed FUNCINPEC senior officials Prince Norodom Sirivudh 
and Nhek Bunchhay as co-Ministers of Interior and Defense, 
respectively.  The two will retain their posts as deputy 
prime ministers.  Hun Sen said the removals were a step 
towards improving government efficiency, noting that 
government officials within the military and police no 
longer would belong to any political party.  He further 
explained that, in the future, RGC officials would no longer 
represent their parties, but rather the government, and that 
the party quota system in Cambodian governments was at an 
end. 
 
¶3.  (U)  The PM said he did not expect the move to produce 
any difficulties in his coalition with FUNCINPEC and 
predicted that, if FUNCINPEC leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
proposed leaving the government, his party members would not 
join him.  The PM added that he would welcome FUNCINPEC 
officials into the CPP, should anyone want to defect.  Nhek 
Bunchhay did not protest his removal and agreed that getting 
rid of the co-ministers would expedite the work of the MOD. 
However, FUNCINPEC MP Monh Saphan later told reporters the 
removal of the two FUNCINPEC officials was a breach of the 
2004 CPP-FUNCINPEC agreement to create a governing 
coalition.  There was also speculation that Prince 
Ranariddh, president of the Natinal Assembly, might also be 
removed as co-chairman of the Council for Development of 
Cambodia, which manages foreign investment. 
 
National Assembly Passes Amendment 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U)  On March 2, 96 of 97 MPs present voted in favor of 
an opposition-proposed constitutional amendment permitting 
the formation of governments through a 50 percent plus one 
majority of the National Assembly.  MPs of all three parties 
supported the draft.  CPP DPM Sok An defended the amendment 
in National Assembly full-floor debate.  Opposition leader 
Sam Rainsy also told the NA that the amendment would prevent 
the types of political deadlock Cambodia had experienced 
following each election and would be another step towards 
reaching a true democracy in Cambodia, which he said also 
required independent and efficient legislative, judicial, 
administrative, and security institutions. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Rumors regarding possible removals of FUCINPEC 
officials and entry into government of opposition officials 
have been circulating since Rainsy's recent return and his 
reconciliation with Hun Sen.  Although they voted for the 
amendment, FUNCINPEC officials reportedly were concerned 
about the potential diminution of their party's influence as 
the CPP has the requisite 50% plus one votes on its own.  It 
is still unclear whether the change will permit the CPP to 
shake off its FUNCINPEC coalition partner before the next 
national elections in 2008, or whether Hun Sen will invite 
SRP members into government, although the CPP and SRP are 
clearly flirting with such a possibility.  The 
constitutional amendment holds the potential to permit one 
party to rule on its own.  However, the former 2/3 majority 
requirement - instituted during the Paris Peace Accord 
negotiations in 1991 to foster national reconciliation - 
increasingly seemed out of date.  On balance, the reform 
seems a step toward a more normally functioning democracy in 
Cambodia.
