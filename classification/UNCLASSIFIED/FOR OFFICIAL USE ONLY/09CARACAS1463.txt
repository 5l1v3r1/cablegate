SUBJECT: VENEZUELA: CADIVI RULES CHANGE FOR TRAVELERS 
 
REF: CARACAS 3 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Venezuela's foreign currency board, known by 
its Spanish acronym CADIVI, is changing the rules by which 
travelers can access foreign exchange at the official rate when 
using local credit cards abroad.  The new regulation has not yet 
been published, but CADIVI's president has said it will include a 
requirement for travelers to register each trip with CADIVI and a 
sliding scale according to which the amount of foreign exchange 
CADIVI would authorize for a given trip would vary according to 
duration and destination.  The requirement for registering is 
already in effect.  CADIVI authorizations for foreign travel have 
declined in 2009 versus 2008, probably largely as a result of a 
reduction in the overall limit authorized per traveler per year. 
Many local analysts expect a further decline in CADIVI 
authorizations for foreign travel in 2010.  This outcome makes 
sense from a political perspective, as these authorizations are 
essentially a subsidy to Venezuelans traveling abroad.  End 
summary. 
 
 
 
From an Annual "Cupo"... 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U) The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela 
(GBRV) has administered foreign currency controls since 2003 
through a commission known by its Spanish acronym CADIVI.  One set 
of CADIVI regulations governs how Venezuelans can access foreign 
exchange at the official exchange rate for travel and/or purchases 
abroad.  (Note:  The official exchange rate is 2.15 bolivars 
(Bs)/USD.  The current parallel exchange rate is 5.4 Bs/USD.  It is 
thus to a traveler's great advantage to obtain dollars from CADIVI 
rather than the parallel market.  End note.)  According to existing 
regulations, a traveler is entitled to spend up to USD 2,500 per 
year (known in Spanish as the "cupo") on one local credit card 
while traveling abroad.  The local bank that issued the credit card 
may request reimbursement from CADIVI at the official rate up to 
that limit.  Each Venezuelan may also spend up to USD 400 per year 
on Internet purchases using a local credit card and may purchase up 
to USD 500 per year in cash before traveling, both at the official 
exchange rate. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The GBRV's policy of effectively subsidizing foreign 
travel has the perverse effect (from its perspective) of 
encouraging travel to the U.S. and demand for U.S. visas. 
Travelers must wait several months to obtain appointments at the 
Embassy for tourist and business visas because of heavy demand, but 
this wait has not deterred tens of thousands of first-time 
applicants. 
 
 
 
...To Authorization By Destination and Duration 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U) According to CADIVI president Manuel Barroso, CADIVI will 
issue a new regulation in the next several weeks governing how 
travelers may access foreign exchange at the official exchange 
rate.  Per Barroso, travelers will have to register each trip with 
CADIVI and will be authorized an amount for each trip depending on 
the duration and destination of the trip.  Barroso said in a press 
interview that the online registration system will be available 
starting December 7 for travel beginning on or after January 1, 
¶2010.  In the interim, CADIVI introduced on November 9 a 
registration system for travel in December 2009.  Barroso has not 
revealed the scale that CADIVI will use to determine the amount 
authorized for a given trip.  He has hinted that an amount greater 
than USD 2,500 could be authorized for long trips to far-flung 
destinations.  He has also stated that parents may purchase 
additional cash in advance if they have children traveling with 
them. 
 
 
Comment:  Why the Change? 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) There are several possible explanations for the expected 
changes.  Barroso has hinted that one reason is to ensure that the 
hard currency allocated for foreign travel is used appropriately. 
In past years, there have been considerable reports of fraud 
associated with credit card use.  A previous CADIVI regulation 
lowering the "cupo" amount also included several provisions 
designed to reduce fraud (reftel), and CADIVI has taken action 
against individuals suspected of fraud. By requiring travelers to 
state the destination and duration of their trips and authorizing a 
given amount per trip, CADIVI may conceivably further reduce the 
incentives for fraud. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Many local analysts suspect, however, that the primary 
motive behind the changes is to reduce the total amount of foreign 
exchange CADIVI authorizes for travelers.  In 2008, CADIVI 
authorized USD 4.8 billion for credit card use (including travel 
and Internet purchases), or 10.3 percent of total CADIVI 
authorizations.  In 2009, credit card authorizations through 
September were USD 2.5 billion, or 12.3 percent of total CADIVI 
authorizations, on pace to end 2009 at approximately USD 3.3 
billion.  (Note:  The expected drop from 2008 to 2009 probably 
largely reflects the reduction in the cupo and associated 
anti-fraud measures [reftel], as well as greater delays in CADIVI's 
authorizing what banks have requested based on their customers' 
credit card use.  End note.)  Many analysts think CADIVI will 
authorize less for foreign travel in 2010 than in 2009, either 
because the additional bureaucratic procedures prove too onerous 
(perhaps partly by design) or because CADIVI authorizes less per 
traveler.  This outcome makes sense from a political perspective, 
as CADIVI is currently essentially subsidizing foreign travel for 
Venezuelans who are generally of the middle and upper class and 
therefore less likely to support President Chavez.  The new system 
also will also allow the government to collect information on the 
travel patterns of Venezuelan travelers who seek to access CADIVI 
dollars.  End comment.
