HUMANITARIAN/SECURITY/INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
¶8. (SBU) IFRC assesses the city of Logane is "leveled" 
with up to 10,000 people camped in a soccer stadium. The 
camp has received no assistance from any group to date. 
Doctors Without Borders noted increasing reports of 
diarrhea in the last week, and about half of the people 
receiving treatment were suffering from mental trauma. 
Six NGOs have committed to overseeing distribution of food 
at eleven of the fifteen planned WFP food distribution 
sites planned for Port-au-Prince and its suburbs. The 
Emergency Shelter and Non-Food Item Cluster is 
recommending smaller settlements (10,000 per camp) rather 
than larger settlements the GOH is proposing (100,000 per 
camp). The recommendation for smaller camps is based in 
part on difficulty in finding enough space to accommodate 
the larger camps. Angry crowds mobbed three food 
distribution sites in Port-au-Prince January 28 and 
MINUSTAH peacekeepers in Cite Soleil fired warning shots 
when a crowd turned unruly. UN called the performance of 
the Haitian National Police "outstanding," noting that 
nearly three-quarters of the 14,000 man force is back on 
the street. SOUTHCOM assess the police presence in Port- 
au-Prince as "marginal." SIRIUS/XM is working with USAID 
on a plan to deliver radios to media outlets in order to 
disseminate Voice of America (VOA) programming. 
USAID has established an orphans and vulnerable children 
working group that will work with the GOH and private aid 
groups to address concerns about child kidnapping and 
smuggling. The main port in Port-au-Prince sustained more 
damage than originally thought and operations on the pier 
were suspended January 28. Repair supplies are being 
loaded at Jacksonville. In the interim, the GOH has 
suggested that some traffic can be transferred to the port 
at Lafiteau, ten miles north of Port-au-Prince.

POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶9. (U) Senators Dodd (D-CT) and Lugar (R-IN) introduced 
legislation on January 28 that would instruct Treasury to 
work with other nations to forgive Haiti's international 
debt, increase trade, and create an infrastructure fund.
