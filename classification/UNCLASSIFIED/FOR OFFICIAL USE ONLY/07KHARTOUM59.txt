SUBJECT:  Sudan:  U.S. Business Facilitation and Commercial 
Promotion 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request - see para 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Stringent U.S. economic sanctions against Sudan have 
drastically limited opportunities for U.S. firms to supply goods and 
services in this nation of more than 40 million consumers.  Only 
U.S. firms licensed by OFAC are able to compete in this expanding 
market, although recent legislation provides additional prospects 
for lawful trade. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Under the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act, signed into 
law on October 13, 2006, U.S. firms are no longer prohibited from 
doing business in Southern Sudan, the Three Areas, Darfur, and 
marginalized areas around Khartoum.  Embassy Khartoum is beginning 
to receive U.S. commercial inquiries, and has consulted with FCS 
Nairobi regarding prospects for business facilitation and commercial 
promotion under these changing conditions. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action requested:  Embassy Khartoum requests Department (AF 
and EB) collaborate with the Departments of Commerce and Treasury to 
develop cleared guidance to address the anticipated interest of U.S. 
firms in lawful commercial opportunities in Sudan. 
 
¶5. (U) Thanks for assistance.
