SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST REGARDING KUWAITI AND SAUDI 
DETAINEES 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Post asks that the Department 
request that Embassy Kuwait and Embassy Riyadh consult 
with GOK and and KSA as a matter of priority as to 
whether either government is interested in providing 
assistance to the Kuwaiti and Saudi nationals listed 
below upon their release from the Baghdad Central 
Correctional Facility at Abu Ghraib, where they are 
currenly detained by Coalition Forces. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) BACKGROUND: The twenty-two individuals 
listed below were detained on November 26 and 30 after 
they were observed crossing illegally into Iraq. All 
claimed to be on a camping/falcon hunting trip; their 
vehicles were stocked with camping equipment, although 
neither falcons nor guns were found. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) BACKGROUND, CONTINUED: Coalition Forces have 
determined that these individuals do not merit further 
detention. Given the security situation, military 
authorities have asked that we determine whether the 
governments of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia wish to provide 
transport and consular assistance at the point of 
release at Abu Ghraib, in Baghdad. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Post requests that Embassies 
Kuwait and Riyadh be asked to determine, as soon as 
possible, whether GOK and KSA wish to provide 
assistance to the following individuals:
