SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE - BHUTTO ASSASSINATION AND US 
POLICY FOR PAKISTAN'S ELECTIONS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 170928 
 
(SBU) PolChief raised subject demarche with Johan Schalin, 
Office Director of the Finnish MFA's Unit for Asia.  Schalin 
said Finland generally shared our views regarding the need 
for united international community support to Pakistan as it 
seeks to continue the journey toward democracy.  However, 
Schalin also stressed that elections are only one part of the 
democratization process; the GoF does not oppose holding them 
as scheduled, provided they do not undermine voter confidence 
or, worse, lead to further political instability or violence. 
 He added that the Bhutto assassination makes it "very 
difficult to imagine" that free, fair and non-violent 
elections can still be held on January 8.
