SUBJECT: KAOHSIUNG VICE MAYOR SUDDENLY REPLACED 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Kaohsiung City Government announced the 
appointment of new Vice Mayor Lee Yung-te to replace out-going Chiu 
Tai-shan on August 16.  Although the media reported in early August 
that Chiu had privately informed Mayor Chen Chu of his willingness 
to resign following accusations of incompetence, Mayor Chen 
adamantly denied those reports until she announced the appointment 
of a new Vice Mayor on August 16.  The timing of the switch came as 
a surprise to the out-going Vice Mayor, who was not even in town 
when his executive assistant was informed by the Mayor's office that 
he was being replaced.  The in-coming Vice Mayor Lee Yung-te, who is 
of Hakka descent, was the former Executive Yuan Hakka Affairs 
Council Chairman from 2005 to 2008 and has extensive experience in 
the media industry.  The move by the Mayor to replace Chiu Tai-shan 
with the media savvy Lee Yung-te is seen by many as a way for her to 
prepare for her reelection campaign by using Lee to handle the media 
and help garner Hakka votes.  End summary.

Outgoing Vice Mayor Upset by the Short Notice 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The outgoing Vice Mayor's Executive Assistant Lee Chung-che 
told AIT/K that the Mayor's office informed him on August 13 that 
Vice Mayor Chiu should clean out his office by August 15.  Only 
later did Mayor Chen Chu call Chiu to let him know he was being 
replaced.  (Chiu received the call while visiting his wife in the 
U.S.)  On August 16, the Mayor informed the press that Lee Yung-te 
would replace Chiu as Vice Mayor on August 18.  Chiu's Executive 
Assistant told AIT/K that the former Vice Mayor was furious over the 
way the Mayor handled the situation.  Although Chiu had offered his 
resignation verbally to the Mayor in June, Chiu had received no 
indication of if or when the Mayor would replace him.  Chiu thought 
it was particularly rude of the Mayor to kick him out even before he 
could get back from the States to clean out his office.

Mayor Chen Chu's Re-election Bid 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Chiu's ouster is likely part of the Mayor's longer-term 
effort to get ready for the 2010 Mayoral election.  The new Vice 
Mayor, Lee Yung-te, is of Hakka descent and comes from Mei-nung 
Village in Kaohsiung County.  His Hakka origins may boost the 
Mayor's candidacy since the Hakka community constitutes 13 percent 
of the eligible voters in Kaohsiung.  Lee's history in journalism 
may also prove a valuable asset in promoting Chen Chu's expected 
reelection bid.

Bio of New Vice Mayor Lee Yung-te 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Lee was born on May 30, 1955 in Mei-nung Village, Kaohsiung 
County.  Lee graduated from National Cheng Chi University in 1976. 
He worked as a Researcher at the College of Mass Communication in 
Stanford University in association with the Knight Ridder Foundation 
from 2000 to 2001.  He most recently served as the Executive Yuan 
Hakka Affairs Council Chairman from 2005 to 2008 and as Vice 
Chairman in 2004.  He has also worked as the General Manager of a 
Public Television Service Foundation and as a reporter and Chief 
Editor for the defunct Independent Evening Post.

¶5. (SBU) Although many in Mayor Chen Chu's own party (DPP) doubt her 
ability to wage a successful reelection campaign due to her poor 
health, this recent replacement of her Vice Mayor is one more 
indicator that she intends to run again in 2010.
