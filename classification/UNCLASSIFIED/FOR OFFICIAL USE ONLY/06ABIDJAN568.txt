SUBJECT: COTE D'IVOIRE:  PILOT IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM 
CONCLUDED ON MAY 27 
 
REF: ABIDJAN 532 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary:  From May 18 through 24, 4810 applicants 
were interviewed at seven sites in the pilot identification 
program. A total of 2601 birth certificates and 2188 
certificates of nationality were approved after interviews 
averaging 40 minutes per person.  The pilot identification 
program was extended by two days until May 27 due to high 
demand and as May 25 was a national holiday.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Numbers by region:  In the government controlled 
south, a total of 1285 applicants were interviewed, 972 birth 
certificates were issued and 356 certificates of nationality 
were posted to an internet published list of qualified 
applicants.  In the Zone of Confidence, 1406 applicants were 
interviewed, 965 birth certificates issued and 829 
certificates of nationality posted.  In the New Forces-held 
north, 2119 applicants were interviewed, 664 birth 
certificates issued and 1003 certificates of nationality 
posted. 
 
¶3.  (U) A workshop incorporating the National Identification 
Supervisory Commission (NISC), members of the Ivorian 
government, UN personnel, EU representatives, and the High 
Representative for Elections is scheduled for early June to 
analyze the results from the pilot program.  The NISC, 
created in 2004, is a result of the Linas Marcoussis 
agreements and supervises the work done by the National 
Identification Office.  No dates have yet been set for a 
national identification program. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) After the first day, the population was able to 
participate in the process without significant harassment 
from pro-FPI militias (though these continued to pass out 
literature calling for disarmament before identification). 
Nevertheless, the interview process remained overly drawn out 
and cumbersome.  At the rate interviews were conducted during 
the pilot phase, it would take a very long time indeed to 
complete a national identification program.  There were also 
complaints that the interviews, conducted by five 
magistrates, were intimidating to many participants. 
Finally, though called a pilot identification program, we 
note that this effort did not result in the issuance a single 
identity card.  Without these, which would probably have to 
be issued at the same time that voters are registered, there 
can be no move to elections.
