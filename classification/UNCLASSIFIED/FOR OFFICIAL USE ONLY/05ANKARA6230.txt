¶1. (SBU) On Oct. 3, PolMilOff called on MFA Head of 
Department for NATO Political Affairs Atilla Gunay to deliver 
ref a demarche.  Gunay responded that Turkey will indeed urge 
the Ukrainian government to finalize the NATO-PfP Trust Fund 
implementing agreement with the NATO Maintenance and Supply 
Agency as soon as possible. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We took advantage of this meeting to remind Gunay 
that Turkey had never responded to ref b request to provide 
additional funding to the NATO-PfP Trust Fund to destroy 
outdated Ukrainian munitions.  Gunay said that while Ukraine 
is a high priority for the GOT, MFA has no funds available 
for the trust fund.  However, MFA had asked the Defense 
Ministry and Turkish General Staff to contribute, and the 
matter now rested with TGS J5. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We followed up with TGS J5 Branch Chief COL Kasim 
Erdem on Oct. 6 and again on Oct. 13, but Erdem reported that 
TGS has yet to make a decision on contributing funds.  We 
will follow up with TGS shortly.
