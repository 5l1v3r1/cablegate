Â¶1. (SBU) In response to reftel demarches by Ambassador and 
DCM, the MFA released the following statement June 1: 
 
"Bulgaria welcomes the statement by the Secretary of State 
Condoleeza Rice for the preparedness of the USA to become a 
full partner to the EU 3 negotiations with Iran. 
 
This new initiative is an important step towards finding a 
diplomatic solution and enhances the prospects for success. 
 
Bulgaria reiterates its support for the continuous efforts of 
the European Union and other major international factors to 
bring about a viable solution acceptable to all. 
 
We expect that Iran will seriously consider the US proposal, 
demonstrate its willingness to restore the confidence of the 
international community and act in conformity with the 
international agreements and commitments as well as with the 
respective IAEA requirements."
