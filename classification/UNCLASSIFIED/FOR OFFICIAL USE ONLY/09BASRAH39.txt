SUBJECT: TOUR DE TABLE WITH BASRA'S SUNNI SHEIKHS AND CLERICS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  In a June 28 meeting with the Deputy Team 
Leader and other Basra PRT members, 14 Sunni tribal sheikhs and 
clerics from the districts of Basra, Abul Kasib, Al Faw, and Al 
Zubair, shared their views on political, security, and 
development issues.  They voiced disenchantment with the Iraqi 
Islamic Party and favorable opinions of Prime Minister Maliki, 
complained about the police and army's detention practices, and 
asked for USG assistance in improving essential services and 
employment in the province.  End summary. 
¶2. (SBU) Dr. Khalid Al Mulla, Director of the Iraqi Educated 
Elite and Secular League (South Branch), led off the discussion. 
 He stated that the sheikhs have rejected the Al-Qaeda in Iraq 
and other radical movements, and noted the positive role the 
Sheikhs have played in stemming sectarian violence.  The sheikh 
said that Sunnis have the capability and the desire to help 
rebuild Iraq. 
¶3. (SBU) Turning to politics, Dr. Al Mulla said that the Sunni 
Endowment and Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP) have basically 
disregarded Sunni interests.  Other sheikhs echoed this 
sentiment, concluding that politicians make promises and pretend 
to support a certain position only to abandon it later.  Noting 
that Prime Minister Maliki was viewed favorably within their 
communities, several sheiks said that many Sunnis here had voted 
for the Rule of Law coalition in the Provincial Council 
elections.  These Sunnis and others were looking to align 
themselves with Maliki again in the national elections in 
January.  They thought that overall Sunni support for the IIP 
would fall dramatically. 
¶4. (SBU) The Deputy Team Leader asked about the sheikh and 
cleric's experience with the security forces.  The sheikhs said 
that both the police and army rely on suspect sources to gain 
information about their communities.  They viewed both 
organizations as under the control of political parties or 
militias.  A cleric complained that people were being 
apprehended and detained by both the police and the army based 
on little or no evidence.  The detainees remain in detention 
until trial, and the cleric cited one case of an individual who 
has been in detention since 2004. 
¶5. (SBU) On the issue of regional development, the sheikhs said 
that essential basic services were lacking in many areas of 
Basra Province.  Their communities were suffering and people 
were in desperate need of jobs.  They hoped that the USG could 
undertake various projects to remedy these problems, noting that 
such projects would not only improve their living conditions, 
but also enhance America's image.  The Deputy Team Leader 
replied that $2.3 billion had already been spent on projects in 
Basra Province.  Money was available for additional projects, he 
added, but new brick and mortar projects would have to receive 
the approval of the ministry responsible for operation and 
maintenance to insure their sustainability.  The sheikhs 
concurred with the Deputy that private investment would be vital 
to the region's future. 
¶6. (SBU) Comment:  The sheikhs' unhappiness with the IIP and 
their favorable views of PM Maliki and his coalition suggest 
that nationalist sentiments may be growing among the Sunni 
community in the south.  Certainly the March/April 2008 Charge 
of the Knights operation has brought huge security gains to the 
region and diminished the power and influence of the Shia 
militants -- all positive developments for the minority Sunni 
population.  If the disappointment in the IIP expressed by our 
local sheikhs and clerics is shared in other Sunni communities 
beyond the province, then the IIP faces an uphill battle in the 
January 2010 national elections.
