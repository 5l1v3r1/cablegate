SUBJECT: RWANDA 2009 COUNTRY REPORT ON TERRORISM 
 
¶1. (SBU)There were no acts of international terrorism in 
Rwanda in 2009.  The Rwandan government worked to improve 
border control measures and prepared to create a financial 
investigations unit, in accordance with anti-money 
laundering/counter-terrorist financing legislation adopted 
the previous year.  In November, Rwanda's parliament ratified 
the African Union protocol on prevention and combating of 
terrorism.  In August, a U.S. Coast Guard team trained 
Rwandan security forces at Lake Kivu, bordering the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), on maritime 
patrolling and law enforcement techniques.  During the year, 
Rwandan law enforcement officers also participated in 
U.S.-sponsored training courses on criminal investigation 
techniques and small arms identification. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda 
(FDLR) and the Rally for Unity and Democracy (RUD-Urunana), 
two rebel groups that include former supporters of the regime 
that orchestrated the 1994 Rwandan genocide, continued to 
operate in eastern DRC.  During the year, FDLR and 
RUD-Urunana forces deliberately attacked Congolese civilians 
in order to achieve political and military objectives.
