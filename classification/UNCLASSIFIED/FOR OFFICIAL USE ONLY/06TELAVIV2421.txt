CONSULATE GENERAL JERUSALEM CLEARED THIS MESSAGE. 
 
¶1. (SBU) PALESTINIAN AND ISRAEL REPRESENTATIVES OF 
ECOPEACE/FRIENDS OF THE EARTH MIDDLE EAST (FOEME) MET WITH 
NEA SENIOR S&T ADVISOR CHARLES LAWSON, CONSULATE GENERAL 
ECONOMIC OFFICER AND EMBASSY ESTH OFFICER AT THE CONGEN IN 
JERUSALEM JUNE 14 TO DESCRIBE THEIR FINDINGS ON THE 
DETERIORATING MOUNTAIN AQUIFER SHARED BY ISRAELIS AND 
PALESTINIANS.  THE FOEME REPS NOTED THAT LARGE QUANTITIES OF 
UNTREATED WASTEWATER AND SOLID WASTE ARE DUMPED ON THE 
AQUIFER'S SENSITIVE RECHARGE AREA ON THE WEST BANK, RISKING 
THE FUTURE AVAILABILITY OF SCARCE WATER.  THEY SAID THAT 
THEIR CONCERNS WERE SHARED BY ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN WATER 
OFFICIALS AND SCIENTISTS.  THE FOEME REPRESENTATIVES ASKED 
THAT THE USG TREAT SANITATION ISSUES AS HUMANITARIAN 
CONCERNS AND THAT USAID CONTINUE ITS PREVIOUS WORK ON SEWAGE 
TREATMENT IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES INCLUDING THE 
SUSPENDED HEBRON WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT. 
 
¶2. (SBU) FOEME IS BEGINNING ITS THIRD STUDY OF THE MOUNTAIN 
AQUIFER, FOLLOWING EARLIER REPORTS ON THE AFFECTS OF SOLID 
WASTE AND SEWAGE ON THE AQUIFER.  THE THIRD REPORT, LIKE THE 
PREVIOUS STUDIES SUPPORTED BY THE GOLDMAN FUND, WILL FOCUS 
ON RURAL SANITATION ISSUES.  THE NGO REPRESENTATIVES SAID 
THAT MORE THAN 60 PERCENT OF PALESTINIAN SEWAGE IN THE WEST 
BANK COMES FROM RURAL VILLAGES.  THEY PROPOSED THAT THE USG 
FIND WAYS TO BENEFIT PALESTINIANS BY WORKING ON SEWAGE 
PROBLEMS IN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.  THEY NOTED THAT GERMANY 
WAS MOVING AHEAD WITH SEVERAL LARGE SEWAGE TREATMENT 
PROJECTS IN LARGER JURISDICTIONS AND ITALY WAS SUPPORTING 
THE CREATION OF LOCAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT COUNCILS.  THEY 
SAID THAT RESTRICTIONS ON THE MOVEMENT OF PALESTINIANS WERE 
THE SINGLE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO PROPER DISPOSAL OF SOLID 
WASTE.  FOEME PLANS TO MEET WITH GOI DEFENSE MINISTER PERETZ 
TO DISCUSS HOW THE MOD COULD HELP ALLEVIATE SUCH PROBLEMS.
