¶1.  (SBU) On September 23, Science Officer met with officials from 
the Brazilian Ministry of Health's International Affairs Office to 
discuss REFTEL, which concerns an agreement by Brazil and certain 
other countires to work in concert with the United States and the 
World Health Organization to make 10% of their H1N1 vaccine supplies 
available to vulnerable countries.  These Ministry of Health 
officials normally would be familiar with such an international 
arrangement.  In this case, however, they were not aware that the 
Government of Brazil had signed on to such an agreement.  They 
promised to follow-up within the Ministry and through their 
interagency process and report back to the Embassy. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Embassy will report any new information as soon as it 
is received.
