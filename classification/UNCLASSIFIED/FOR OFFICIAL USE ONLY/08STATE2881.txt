SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST: PUBLIC TALKING POINTS ON IRAN IN 
IRAQ 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an joint OSD-State action request; see para 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary:  The Department of State and Department of 
Defense have prepared talking points that Posts should draw 
on when asked by their interlocutors about Iran's role in 
Iraq.   END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Action Request: At post's discretion, you may draw 
on the following points when discussing Iranian contributions 
to the decrease in violence in Iraq. 
 
--The United States is pleased about the reduced levels of 
violence in Iraq in recent months, including a decrease in 
sophisticated EFP roadside bomb attacks.  The number of 
overall attacks inside Iraq has decreased, to include those 
carried out using Iranian-supplied weapons. 
 
--We caution, however, that this decrease could be temporary 
and that incidents involving EFPs still remain above 
historical averages. 
 
--As Ambassador Crocker has noted, how lasting a phenomenon 
this will be and how Iran will define its own role in Iraq 
are open questions. 
 
--We attribute the overall reduction in violence, in part, to 
a number of factors, including:  the Iraqi people,s growing 
rejection of extremist forces; improvements in the 
effectiveness of coalition and Iraqi tactics to counter the 
terrorist threat; and benefits from the increased number of 
American and Iraqi forces in the country. 
 
--We also believe the reduction in violence may be 
attributable to military pressure to counter Iran s Qods 
Force and Iranian surrogate support for select groups of 
Iraqi Shia militants. 
 
--Despite Iran,s public claims, Iranian-supplied weapons 
continue to be used in attacks on Iraqi and Multinational 
forces.  The flow of Iranian weapons and munitions into Iraq 
has not ceased.  Iranian-backed militias and criminal gangs 
also pose a major challenge to Iraq's legitimate government 
authorities, particularly in areas of southern Iraq, 
including Iraq's second largest city, Basrah. 
 
--We also have evidence that Iran is continuing to train 
militants at camps inside Iran for attacks on coalition and 
Iraqi targets. 
 
--It is imperative that Iran end all forms of 
support-weapons, funding, and training-for illegal armed 
groups in Iraq and cease its destabilizing activities in 
Iraq.  This is a major concern of the U.S. and a violation of 
UN Security Council resolutions and we will continue to press 
Iran on this, including in U.S.-Iran-Iraq talks in Baghdad. 
 
--In addition, Iran,s support for the Taliban and other 
militant groups in Afghanistan has continued over the course 
of the past year. 
 
--We will continue to take all necessary measures to secure 
our troops and to support the Iraqi government as it works to 
defeat the terrorists and extremists that are still 
determined to destabilize Iraq. 
 
End Action Request.
