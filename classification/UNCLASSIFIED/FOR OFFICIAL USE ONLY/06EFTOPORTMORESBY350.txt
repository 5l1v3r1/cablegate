SUBJECT: NOTHING FISHY ON THE INDONESIAN BOARDER 
 
1.(U) The shooting of an Indonesian fisherman off the north 
coast of PNG has sparked a number of paranoid press reports on 
alleged Indonesian activity. All evidence we have suggests the 
reports are sourced from either NGOs seeking to draw attention 
to Papuan separatist causes or from others seeking a place in 
the limelight. 
 
2.(U) On August 8, a PNG fisheries patrol accompanied by Defense 
force personnel (PNGDF) encountered eight Indonesian fishermen 
within the 12 nautical mile limit off PNG's north coast.  The 
PNGDF soldiers opened fire, killing one and injuring two others. 
 The balance were taken into custody. 
 
3.(U) There has since been a spate of stories in the local press 
which can only be characterized as paranoid.  Stories of a 
similar nature have been picked up from the Australian media. 
The fishermen have been labeled as Indonesian Intelligence 
officers (Kapassus).  One source listed the fishermen with 
improbable precision as "a commander, a medic, a radioman, a 
signaler and a rifleman plus three Kapassus officers.  Various 
West Papuan groups have warned of large Indonesian troop 
buildups since the incident and of "fears of imminent invasion". 
 The local press picked up a report in the Australian Bulletin 
claiming that Indonesian intelligence is so heavily established 
within PNG that it "virtually runs some towns on the border." 
Also recycled were reports of a senior "Indonesian double agent" 
in the previous PNG government. 
 
4.(SBU) The reports have been roundly denied by the government, 
the Indonesian embassy, and in private by everyone with any 
credibility we have talked to.  The PNGDF lacks the resources to 
regularly patrol Indonesia's border waters. We understand that 
fishing back and forth across the border is relatively common 
and that there may be customary arrangements among traditional 
groups on both sides of the border to this effect. There are 
some legitimate questions about the use of lethal force in such 
a situation.  However, all evidence we have heard portrays as 
balderdash the notion that these fishermen were part of some 
sinister intelligence operation.
