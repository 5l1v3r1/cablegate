¶1.  In an August 27 response to reftel, Steve McCombie, Senior 
Policy Officer, Asia Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade forwarded a breakdown of how the GNZ humanitarian 
contribution to Pakistan will be delivered.  This contribution was 
announced at the Pakistan Donors' Conference in Tokyo in April. 
New Zealand's Agency for International Development (NZAID) advised 
that the funds will be disbursed to relevant agencies in the next 
month. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  New Zealand pledged a total of $1 million NZD to 
Pakistan and will distribute that sum in two $500,000 NZD 
contributions, one to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) 
and the second to UNICEF.  UNFPA will use this donation to fund 
reproductive health services such as emergency obstetric clinics 
and hygiene kits for women displaced by conflict in Pakistan's 
Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP).  UNICEF will use the NZAID 
funds to support ongoing and future education services for 
displaced primary school children in IDP camps and host 
communities.
