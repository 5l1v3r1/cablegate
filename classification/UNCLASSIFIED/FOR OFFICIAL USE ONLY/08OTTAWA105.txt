(SBU) Director of the Office of Aboriginal and Circumpolar 
Affairs at the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade Paul Gibbard told PolOff that he has been 
in frequent contact with L/HRR on the UN Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UN DRIP).  Gibbard stated that 
high-level deliberations on indigenous rights are ongoing in 
Canada, and noted that while he had no news to report at the 
moment, Canada may make some policy decisions in the coming 
weeks.  The USG does not implement programs supporting 
indigenous communities in Canada.
