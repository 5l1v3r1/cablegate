 (SBU) PolOff presented reftel points November 3 to Luis 
Carranza, Deputy Director for UN Affairs in the Foreign 
Ministry's Multilateral Affairs Directorate.  Carranza said 
that he would pass on the request but believed it unlikely 
that the summit would deal with Cuba as the intent (at least 
of the GOG) was to try to alleviate or minimize the regional 
polarization that had resulted from the contest for the 
Security Council seat.
