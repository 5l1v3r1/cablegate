¶1. (SBU) EconOff delivered Ref A demarche to Hayat Mesbah, 
Head of the Service of Conservation of Wild Flora and Fauna 
of Morocco's High Commission for Water and Forests and 
Combating Desertification on January 28, inviting Morocco's 
comments on the U.S. proposals for the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and 
Flora (CITES) Conference of Parties (CoP-15).  On February 5, 
Mesbah informed EconOff that Morocco's position on the 
proposals has not yet been determined, and will be decided 
only after internal consultations in late February among the 
CITES Management Authority (the High Commission), the four 
institutions that share responsibilities as CITES Scientific 
Authorities, and other concerned entities such as the 
Department of Fisheries. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Mesbah stated that due to the "delicate" economic 
and political considerations of the proposals, some of which 
involve species of commercial importance, Morocco's decision 
will not be made public until the Doha CoP-15 meeting.  The 
U.S. is not the only country interested in Morocco's 
position, she added, noting that European and Japanese 
diplomats have been contacting her frequently to press 
Morocco to adopt their positions. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Mesbah informed us that she is currently the only 
official slated to represent Morocco at the CoP-15, but she 
has encouraged the Department of Fisheries to send a 
representative as well due to the large number of marine 
species being considered at the meeting.  However, she 
commented, due to limited budgets this year, it is unlikely 
that other officials will be able to attend.

¶4.  (SBU) EconOff discussed Ref B proposal for a Convention 
on Migratory Species Memorandum of Understanding on shark 
conservation with Zakia Driouich, Director of Maritime 
Fisheries at the Department of Fisheries on February 2. 
Driouich responded that Morocco does not plan to send 
representatives to the February 8 - 12 meeting in Manila.
