SIPDIS 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: UNHRC SU AF
SUBJECT: GETTING RENEWAL OF THE SUDAN MANDATE AT THE UN 
 
¶1. (SBU) Action Request:  Given the dire human rights 
situation in Sudan, it is vitally important to pass a 
resolution to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur to 
monitor the human rights situation there and to urge Sudan to 
allow humanitarian access.  Inability to do so would deal 
another blow to the HRC,s credibility.  However, we are also 
concerned that long, fractious discussions over language 
could end up undermining efforts to pass a resolution and 
would be counter-productive.  Mission is therefore instructed 
to approach the Africa Group soonest to see whether it would 
be amenable to running a short text which calls for mandate 
extension and humanitarian access.  End Action Request. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Objectives:  In its conversations with Africa Group 
members, Mission should underscore the following points.  It 
can also convey them to the WEOG and other interested 
parties. 
 
-- Passage of a resolution on Sudan is important given the 
situation there.  Failure to pass a resolution would reflect 
poorly on the HRC as an institution. 
 
-- The resolution must extend the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on Sudan for another year until June 2010 and 
request that the SR present a report at the June 2010 session. 
 
-- In addition, it should call upon all parties to respect 
their obligations under international humanitarian law, in 
particular with regard to humanitarian personnel and the 
protection of civilians, and to respect the international 
human rights of all people, including internally displaced 
persons, refugees, human rights defenders, non-governmental 
organization workers, women, and children. 
 
-- There should also be language urging all parties, in 
particular the UN/AU Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) and UN 
Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), to fully cooperate with their 
mandate to protect civilians and to allow humanitarian 
agencies to move freely and safely throughout Darfur and 
Sudan in order to continue their vital work.  This ability, 
as you know, was threatened in March 2009, when the 
Government of Sudan expelled 13 international aid 
organizations and closed three national agencies. 
 
-- If raised:  We would recommend that there be no reference 
to the International Criminal Court (ICC), as this would only 
inflame the Africa Group from the onset. 
 
¶3. (U) POINTS OF CONTACT AND REPORTING DEADLINE: Mission is 
requested to report the outcome of this demarche via front 
channel cable by no later than June 10, 2009, slugged for 
IO/RHS Amy Ostermeier and DRL/MLGA Kristen McGeeney.
