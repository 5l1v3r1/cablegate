¶1. (SBU) Emboffs delivered reftel demarche to Foreign 
Ministry officials Dirk Jan Wierenga (Iraq desk) and Nelly 
Blokker (Humanitarian Aid Division).  Wierenga stated that 
the Dutch government and parliament share U.S. concerns for 
the humanitarian situation of Iraqi refugees and internally 
displaced persons (IDPs), and has called on the European 
Commission and EU member states to provide support. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Dutch government is allocating EUR 8 million in 
direct assistance to Iraqi refugees and IDPs in 2008, 
doubling its 2007 funding of EUR 4 million.  Of this total, 
EUR 6 million has been earmarked by parliament to assist IDPs 
in northern Iraq.  The remaining EUR 2 million will assist 
Iraqi refugees in Syria and Jordan; the Dutch government is 
still deciding through which channels to disburse this 
tranche. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In addition to this direct funding, the Dutch 
government makes annual, non-earmarked contributions to 
international organizations that are active in assisting 
Iraqi refugees and IDPs.  For example, the Dutch government 
has budgeted EUR 40 million in 2008 for the Central Emegency 
Response Fund (CERF) of the UN,and EUR 25 million for the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) -- out of a 
total 2008 humanitarian aid budget of around EUR 200 million.
