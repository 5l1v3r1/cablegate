¶1.  (U)  THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE, BUT UNCLASSIFIED, AND IT IS NOT 
INTENDED FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  Brazil reports a sharp decline, 25 percent, in 
its rate of deforestation for the year 2006.  Further, it estimates 
that the rate will drop another 30% in 2007.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CONTINUING DECLINES IN THE DEFORESTATION RATE 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The Government of Brazil (GoB) states that the rate of 
deforestation of the Amazon rainforest declined 25% for the year 
2006 (the period between August, 2005 and July 2006), when compared 
to the same period the previous year.  The numbers were announced by 
Environmental Minister Marina Silva together with three other 
Ministers during a news conference on August 10, 2007.  In addition, 
she announced that seven out of the nine states in Brazil's Amazon 
region had deforestation rate reductions.  Further, the Ministry of 
Science and Technology calculates that this reduction avoided 410 
million tons of CO2 emissions, the destruction of 600 million trees 
and 20,000 birds. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  At the same news conference, Minister Silva also 
presented estimated figures for the deforestation rate in 2007.  The 
GoB preliminary estimates for 2007 indicate another 30% reduction in 
the deforestation rate for the Amazon region.  An estimated 9,600 
square km of the rainforest were cleared in the current year that 
ended July 31, 2007 compared to a revised 14,039 square km, the 
previous year.  If the estimates are confirmed, the rate will be the 
lowest figure since 1988, when the country's satellite monitoring 
system was implemented.  A final report is expected to be ready by 
November, 2007.  If confirmed, this would mark the third year in a 
row of major drops in the rate of deforestation. 
 
REACTIONS TO ANNOUNCEMENT 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  In late August, Minister of External Affairs Celso Amorim 
declared that 15 years after the Rio 92 environment conference, GoB 
measures have resulted in an overall 50% decline in the 
deforestation rate of the Amazon.  He later told a Brazilian 
congressional committee that Brazil was no longer in a defensive 
posture on climate change, it would now go into a offensive mode. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  More control on illegal logging, improved certification 
of land ownership, and economic development projects that preserve 
the forest are the main reasons driving the deforestation rate down, 
said President's Chief of Staff Dilma Rousseff during the August 10 
news conference.  All of these actions are part of the 
implementation of the first phase of GoB's Plan for the Control of 
the Deforestation Rate of the Amazon (PPCDA), which started in 2004. 
 Minister Silva stated that for the second phase of the plan the 
rate reduction process will continue trying to reach a zero percent 
illegal deforestation rate. 
 
7  (SBU)  In recent meeting with ESTH officers in the Brazilian 
Ministry of Environment, Secretary for Climate Change and 
Environmental Quality Thelma Krug said that the deforestation drop 
is result of action by governments at various levels, and better law 
enforcement and monitoring on behalf of the GoB. 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  Some question the GoB statements about reducing the 
deforestation rates.  The head of one national NGO working in the 
Amazon region, which has substantial expertise in the cartography 
field, points out that there has been a significant increase in 
fires in the region in the last year.  The National Institute for 
Space Research (INPE) reported a 39 percent increase in the volume 
of fires in the Amazon comparing January 2006 to January 2005. 
Further, the NGO leader claimed that the GoB has poor monitoring of 
some of the most vulnerable areas to incursion, such as along the 
western border in the state of Rondonia and on the northeastern 
border in the state of Amapa.  This expert concluded that these 
factors point to a higher deforestation rate than the one announced 
by the GoB. 
 
COMMENT 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  The Lula Administration has clearly made reducing the 
deforestation rate a priority.  And the GoB has taken measures to 
accomplish this goal:  increased monitoring; raids on illegal 
logging; and expanded protected areas.  We have noted improvements 
in forest management in many states - with some noteable exceptions 
- and localities in the region.  The GoB deserves credit for turning 
around what had been an alarming and accelerating rate of 
deforestation.  The next set of challenges may well come as an 
unintended result of GoB's other priorities:  a sharp increase in 
infrastructure projects (hydroelectric facilities, roads, etc.), and 
an emphasis on increasing sugar cane production.  End Comment
