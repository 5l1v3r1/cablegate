(SBU) Embassy Rangoon recommends against delivering this 
demarche to the GOB, which is generally hostile to U.S. 
initiatives, especially concerning sanctions.  Economic 
relations between Burma and Iran are negligible.  Recently, 
Burma and Iran have voiced support for each other against 
international criticism.
