SUBJECT: CANADA UPDATE ON DONOR PLEDGE FOR SOUTH ASIA 
EARTHQUAKE RECONSTRUCTION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 182566 
 
¶1. (sbu) Econcouns received an update (per reftel) on 
Canada's disbursement of funds pledged for earthquake relief 
and reconstruction in Pakistan from Department of Foreign 
Affairs Pakistan Policy Officer Jon Bonnar and Canadian 
International Development Agency (CIDA) Pakistan Analyst 
Stuart Lane.  Lane suggested that the UN Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) may not have 
the most complete figures for Canada's pledges relating to 
the Pakistani earthquake.  He stated that Canada has 
dispersed CAN $75.6 million in relief and recovery funds, and 
has pledged CAN $40 million in reconstruction funds.  (These 
reconstruction funds were pledged in the fall of 2006.)  Lane 
said that although Canada attended the November 19, 2005 
donor conference in Islamabad, Canada was unable at that time 
to pledge reconstruction funds because the Canadian 
government was in a caretaker status in advance of the 
January 2006 election.  Instead, he said, the Canadian 
delegation restated its earlier pledge of CAN $55.6 million 
in "relief money" that had been immediately dispersed after 
the earthquake in an effort to save lives.
