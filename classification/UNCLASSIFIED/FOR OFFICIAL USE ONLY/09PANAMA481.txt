¶1. (U) Below is Embassy Panama's input for the 
congressionally mandated annual report on investment disputes 
as contemplated in Section 527 of the FY 94-95 Foreign 
Relations Authorizations Act. 
 
The United States is aware of one case in which United States 
citizens have an outstanding claim against the Government of 
Panama. There are no new cases since Embassy Panama's filing 
of the 2008 report. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Last Update: 12 June 2009 
a. Claimant A 
b. 2005 
c. In 1998, Claimant A invested $11 million for a Panamanian 
energy company's equity and arranged for the company to 
receive a $17 million bank bridge loan convertible into 
bonds. Claimant A alleges that both the equity and debt 
investments are subject to equal value tax credits under 
Panamanian Law No. 28 of 1995. In March 2005, the 
Vice-Minister of Finance notified Claimant A that the sale of 
the original $11 million in stock was not subject to any tax 
benefits. Claimant A has taken the matter to arbitration 
under the U.S.-Panama Bilateral Investment Treaty. 
 
POST ACTION: Previously, Post had urged the current GOP 
government to resolve the tax credit dispute promptly and 
fairly.  The matter is in arbitration. Post will raise the 
issue with appropriate members of the new GOP government 
which takes office on July 1.  Post remains in contact with 
Claimant A and is monitoring the matter. On June 8, 2009, 
Claimant A's lawyer stated the case is still in arbitration 
and that there is no indication that the current government 
will resolve the case. However, Claimant A's attorney states 
that the in-coming government has indicated a willingness to 
settle. 
 
List of Claimants: 
 
Claimant A: Corporacion Panamena de Energia S.A. (70% 
interest held by U.S. controlled companies, Unisource Energy 
Corporation and Electric Machinery Enterprises Inc.)
