SUBJECT: CYPRIOT AMBASSADOR IN WARSAW TO REPRESENT GOC AT 
THE PSI HIGH-LEVEL POLITICAL MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 84640 
 
(SBU) Polchief delivered reftel message to Michalis 
Stavrinos, Director of MFA's Division of Legal Affairs, on 
May 26.  Stavrinos indicated that he had been planning to 
head the Cypriot delegation to the June 23 PSI High-Level 
Planning Meeting, but had been forced to withdraw because of 
pressing business in Nicosia.  Instead, the MFA had sent 
detailed instructions to the Cypriot Ambassador in Warsaw, 
who would represent the GOC at the HLPM.  Stavrinos stressed 
that the GOC understood the importance of the HLPM in 
combating the proliferation of WMD.  The ROC's decision to be 
represented at the Ambassadorial level was not, in any way, 
intended to signal a lack of confidence in the PSI. It was 
simply a function of an over-stretched Cypriot foreign 
affairs bureaucracy struggling to cope with competing demands 
and the burden of EU membership.
