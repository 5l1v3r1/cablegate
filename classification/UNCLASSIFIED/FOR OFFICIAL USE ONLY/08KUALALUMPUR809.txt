PROPOSAL 
 
¶1.  (U) This message has been cleared by Embassies Jakarta, 
Manila, and Kuala Lumpur. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY and ACTION REQUEST:  The Legal Attaches 
from Embassies Manila, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur have jointly 
designed a tri-border regional visitors program for police 
and prosecutors handling terrorism and transnational crime 
cases (CTTC).  The program seeks to foster stronger relations 
among police and prosecutors from the tri-border nations, 
while exposing them to the U.S. model of interagency task 
forces and how they pursue investigations and prosecutions of 
CTTC cases.  FBI field offices in Los Angeles and New York, 
as well as FBI Headquarters in Washington, were consulted in 
the development of the proposed program.  The objectives of 
this program accord with the MSP goals of the three posts as 
well as with priorities identified by RSI Ambassadors and by 
their respective Law Enforcement Working Groups.  ACTION 
REQUEST: Posts requests that S/CT support this program using 
regional counterterrorism visitor funds, understanding that 
such funds are distinct from and funded above and beyond 
bilateral voluntary visitor accounts.  Additionally, posts 
would appreciate clarification of whether funds would be 
available to support one representative from each Legatt 
office to accompany their contacts on the visit.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
Proposed Program 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The proposed visit would be provided to a group of

program would bring participants to both large and smaller 
field offices as well as a forensics investigation lab.
