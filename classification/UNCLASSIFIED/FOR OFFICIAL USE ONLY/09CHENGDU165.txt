¶1. (U) This cable contains sensitive but unclassified 
information - not for distribution on the Internet. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary: Yunnan faces more serious human trafficking 
issues than other Chinese provinces, particularly cross-border 
trafficking of women for forced marriages and children for 
illegal adoptions, a Yunnan Provincial Women's Federation (YPWF) 
official told CG.  Yunnan had its own anti-trafficking 
regulations in place long before the central government, and 
currently has an Anti-Trafficking Leading Group to coordinate 
government efforts as well as a special Anti-Trafficking Office 
within the Public Security Bureau.  Cooperation with the 
International Labor Organization (ILO) has yielded good results 
so far, but Yunnan lacks a shelter for trafficking victims.  No 
nexus exists in Yunnan between narcotics and human trafficking, 
Li said.  End Summary. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Human trafficking is a more serious problem in Yunnan 
than in other Chinese provinces YPWF Vice President Li Yi told 
CG August 12 in Kunming.  (PolEconOff, PolEconFSN, and YPWF 
Rights and Interests Department Chief Wu Tao, who participated 
in an IVLP program in July-August 2009, also attended.)  Yunnan 
sees three kinds of trafficking: transnational trafficking, 
trafficking between provinces, and trafficking within the 
province.  While Yunnan's 4060km border with Myanmar, Laos, and 
Vietnam explains the problem of transnational trafficking seen 
in the province, trafficking between Chinese provinces is in 
fact the most prevalent, Li said.  (Note: YPWF's definition of 
TIP, like that used by other Chinese interlocutors, differs from 
the U.S./international definition to include children kidnapped 
for illegal adoptions.  This cable includes issues raised by 
Yunnan officials that do not fall within the standard TIP 
definition, but which do involve human trafficking in more 
general terms.  End Note.) 
 
Yunnan Trafficking Mainly for Marriage and Adoption 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Noting differences between trafficking issues in Yunnan 
Province and other parts of the world, Li explained that women 
are most often trafficked in Yunnan for forced marriages, though 
women from Southeast Asia are trafficked through China and sent 
abroad to work in the sex trade.  Women are often lured by a 
proposed work situation in Yunnan, later realizing that they 
have been brought for forced marriages.  The families into which 
these women are forcibly married are often extremely strict with 
them and prevent their escape, noting that early pregnancies 
often assure they will stay.  Children, on the other hand, 
(primarily male) are generally trafficked for illegal adoptions 
rather than child labor, she said. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Li added that while the majority of trafficking is 
between Chinese provinces, cases do arise of transnational 
trafficking for forced labor.  She gave a recent example of a 
group of Vietnamese being trafficked to China, where they were 
forced to work in a coal mine.  The group was reportedly later 
rescued by the Public Security Bureau and repatriated.  (Note: 
When CG asked Vice Chairman Li for statistics on human 
trafficking cases in Yunnan she declined, saying statistics are 
collected and reported by the PSB or the United Nations 
Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking [UNIAP]. End Note.) 
 
Yunnan Government Anti-Trafficking Efforts 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Yunnan government has paid close attention to human 
trafficking issues, especially since 2002, Li reported.  With 
the cooperation of the ILO, which has conducted a series of 
projects in Yunnan, the government has been able to increase 
public awareness in trafficking prevention, including educating 
migrant farmers and their families on how to prevent and deal 
with trafficking.  They have seen good results recently, Li 
said, though Yunnan lacks adequate assistance facilities for 
victims of trafficking. 
 
¶7. (SBU) An Anti-Trafficking Office exists directly under the 
Yunnan Province Public Security Bureau, Li said, though 
anti-trafficking efforts are coordinated by the Anti-Trafficking 
Leading Group under the Yunnan Province Communist Party and the 
provincial government.  This Leading Group is a loose 
organization of 32 relevant government/social organizations, 
 
CHENGDU 00000165  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
including the PSB, Civil Affairs Department, Education 
Department, Judicial Department, All-China Women's Federation 
(YPWF is part of the ACWF), and others.  Yunnan faced human 
trafficking issues much earlier than other parts of China, Li 
continued, and so already had its own regulations and action 
plan prior to passage and implementation of relevant national 
laws and plans (Ref A). 
 
Waiting on a Shelter for Kunming? 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Li stressed to CG that Kunming currently lacks shelters 
for trafficking victims.  Kunming needs shelters to provide 
accommodation, training, psychological counseling and other 
services to rescued victims of trafficking to help them return 
to normal life.  Kunming is an ideal location for such shelters, 
Li argued, as it is the geographic and transportation center of 
Yunnan, and all rescued victims of trafficking must be first be 
sent to Kunming before reaching their hometown.  Such shelters 
would also serve victims of domestic violence, she added. 
(Note: post understands two proposals have been submitted in the 
past to G/TIP for funding of such shelters, one several years 
ago by the ILO with help from YPWF, and another this year by 
Save the Children with help from YPWF.  Neither proposal 
received funding.  End Note.) 
 
No Narcotics/Human Trafficking Nexus in Yunnan 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶9. (SBU) Asked whether there was any connection between 
narcotics traffickers and human traffickers in Yunnan, Li said 
that while both problems are very complicated, they do not share 
a connection in Yunnan.  Noting the high profit margins in both 
crimes, Li added that one of the major reasons human trafficking 
persists in Yunnan is that a trafficker can sell a baby at the 
price of 8,000 - 10,000 RMB (USD 1200 - 1500), with a profit of 
about 5,000 RMB (USD 750).
