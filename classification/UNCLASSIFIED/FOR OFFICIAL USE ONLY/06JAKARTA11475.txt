HOSTS FOURTH CWC REGIONAL MEETING OF STATES PARTIES IN ASIA 
 
¶1. (U) The Fourth Regional Meeting of CWC States Parties in 
Asia met in Jakarta, Indonesia from September 5-7, 2006.  The 
meeting was attended by 24 States Parties from the Asian 
Group:  Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, 
China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, 
Nepal, Pakistan, Palau, the Philippines, Qatar, Republic of 
Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, United Arab 
Emirates, Vietnam and Yemen.  Three States Parties from other 
regional groups participated: Albania, Australia and the U.S. 
 One State Not Party, Burma, and the International Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC) participated as observers. 
 
¶2. (U) The opening remarks were delivered by OPCW Director 
General Rogelio Pfirter and Indonesian Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Dr. N. Hassan Wirajuda.  DG Pfirter emphasized that 
the diverse technical assistance programs offered by the 
European Union, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the U.S. 
continue to generate progress among the Asian member States. 
Overall, the DG noted, 94 percent of the 179 member States 
had established a national authority; 106 member States had 
draft legislation at various states of processing in their 
countries; but only 38 percent had comprehensive legislation. 
 He emphasized that 36 Asian member States had draft 
legislation and he encouraged them to re-double their efforts 
to enact this legislation.  He welcomed the recent 
announcement that Bhutan and Nauru had designated a national 
authority, but noted that 4 Asian States Parties had yet to 
do so. 
 
¶3. (U) Wirajuda stated that the greatest threat today was the 
potential for terrorists or international crime syndicates to 
gain possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  He 
emphasized that perpetrators like the Bali bombers must never 
be allowed to possess WMD.  He stressed the importance of 
continued technical assistance to enable member States to 
enhance their national capacity.  He emphasized the 
importance of strictly controlling the trans-boundary 
movement of chemicals without hampering the development of 
the peaceful application of dual-use substances.  He 
acknowledged that Indonesia had established a temporary 
national authority and would soon submit its draft 
implementing legislation to the National Assembly.  Once the 
legislation is enacted, the national authority would become 
permanent.  However, he stressed, this situation had not 
precluded Indonesia from submitting industry declarations and 
receiving four OPCW industry inspections to date, none of 
which had found any violations. 
 
¶4. (U) The three-day workshop included briefings by the OPCW 
on the status of implementation, implementation support 
(requests and offers of assistance), the status of issues 
pending in the industry cluster, the legal framework for CWC 
transfer controls and enforcement, and developing synergies 
between the harmonized code and the chemical abstract system. 
 Presentations by the National Authority officials of the 
Asian Group member States covered the status of national 
implementation in their country, and panel discussions were 
held on the role of customs authorities in implementing 
import and export provisions of the CWC in Asia.

¶5. (U) The U.S. delegation presented its experiences in 
providing technical assistance visits to States Parties 
spanning four of the five regional groups, but specifically 
focusing on its outreach in Asia in 2006.  The U.S. 
delegation reiterated its offer of technical assistance to 
States Parties in fulfilling their Article VII obligations 
and to States not Party in acceding or ratifying the treaty. 
 
¶6. (SBU) There were several particularly noteworthy points: 
 
-- Burma was the only State not Party in attendance.  A 
Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs official delivered a 
national statement to inform the group that discussions on 
joining the CWC were occurring at the national level.  All 
relevant ministries had agreed to Burma joining the CWC and 
formal agreement could occur soon, its representative said. 
 
-- Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen requested a 
U.S. technical assistance visit. The U.S. delegation agreed 
to coordinate these visits. 
 
-- Qatar offered to host the Fifth CWC Regional Meeting of 
States Parties in Asia in 2007. 
 
¶7. (U) This message was drafted by USDEL to the conference.
