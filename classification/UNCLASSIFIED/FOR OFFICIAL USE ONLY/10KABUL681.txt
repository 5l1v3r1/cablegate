¶1. This is an action request.  Please see para 3. 
 
¶2.  The U.S. Mission in Afghanistan is looking for the Department's 
best Senior Officers to serve as Senior Civilian Representatives 
(SCR).  SCRs serve as the U.S. Ambassador's direct representative to 
a specific region of Afghanistan (South, Southwest, East, North, 
West).  Given the President's emphasis on strengthening governance 
and development at the sub-national level, these positions involve 
some of the U.S. Mission's most exciting and important work on what 
is arguably our number one foreign policy priority.  In addition to 
acting as the civilian counterpart to the International Security 
Assistance Force (ISAF) military commanders (2-star, SCRs direct the 
work of all Chief of Mission (COM) civilians working in the 
respective RC, a number that currently tops 100 in existing commands 
and is expected to grow in the coming year.  SCRs coordinate closely 
with multiple agencies and entities of the USG to ensure a 'whole of 
government' approach to field activities and interact frequently 
with coalition senior civilians and senior Afghan government 
officials in the region.  The SCR executes U.S. national policy and 
guidance within the region and ensures a coherence of political 
direction and development efforts. 
 
¶3.  Post requests the Department to draw attention to these 
positions through an aldac and through targeting our best Senior 
Foreign Service officers.  Senior Civilian Representative positions 
remain available in RC-East, RC-South (Kandahar, Uruzgan, Dai Kundi 
and Zabul)and the soon-to-be-established RC-SW (Helmand and Nimroz). 
 Thank you for helping us continue to bring the USG's best to these 
jobs.
