(SBU) The Belgian government intends to offer the services of 
several judges to the Special Hariri Tribunal, according to 
the MFA's desk officer for Jordan/Lebanon/Syria.  The current 
caretaker government does not have the authority to authorize 
the provision of funds, the official said.  The Dutch Embassy 
in Brussels has received the same information, Dutch 
colleagues told us when we discussed this matter with them.
