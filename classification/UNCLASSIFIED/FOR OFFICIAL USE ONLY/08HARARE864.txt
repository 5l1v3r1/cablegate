SUBJECT: AGREEMENT'S MEDIA PROVISIONS LACKING 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Local Zimbabwe media groups have cautiously 
welcomed the signing of the power-sharing agreement between the 
Zimbabwe National African Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) and the 
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), noting that it offers some 
hope for media reform. The groups say the agreement acknowledges the 
need for media reform especially in relation to the entry of new 
players and reconstituting key media regulatory structures in the 
country. We are more skeptical, because the agreement denounces 
foreign broadcasters like Voice of America (VOA), and doesn't go as 
far as necessary in guaranteeing a free press. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) The September 15 power-sharing agreement between ZANU-PF and 
the two MDC factions includes several provision related to media. 
Article 19 of the agreement covers Freedom of Expression and 
Communication and recognizes the "right to freedom of expression and 
the role of the media in a multi-party democracy." However, it does 
not include an explicit commitment to repeal the repressive Access 
to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) and Public 
Order and Security Act (POSA). The parties merely agree that the 
"government shall ensure immediate processing of all applications 
for re-registration and registration" under AIPPA; instead of 
calling for the lifting of repressive media laws, the agreement 
states that all Zimbabwean journalists be allowed to register under 
those laws.  The agreement does call for balanced coverage in the 
media and states that "public and private media shall refrain from 
using abusive language that may incite hostility, political 
intolerance and ethnic hatred." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Article 19 states that "foreign government funded external 
radio stations broadcasting into Zimbabwe are not in Zimbabwe's 
national interest," calls on governments to cease funding and 
hosting such stations and encourages Zimbabweans working for them to 
come home. This is clearly targeted at VOA and SW Radio. 
 
¶4. (U) Media watchdog groups in Zimbabwe have cautiously welcomed 
the agreement. The Zimbabwe chapter of the Media Institute of 
Southern Africa (MISA) said the agreement "should usher in a new era 
of tolerance and diversity of views." MISA further urged the 
incoming government to transform state-run radio and TV into a 
"truly independent public broadcaster," and called for the repeal of 
all repressive legislation that targets the media. In a statement, 
the Media Monitoring Project (MMPZ) also welcomed the agreement but 
raised concern that Article 19 of the agreement "substantially fails 
to meet internationally recognized standards regarding media 
freedom," which MMPZ says "can only be achieved by the complete 
reform of all repressive media legislation." 
 
¶5. (SBU) Exiled Zimbabwean journalist Basildon Peta, writing in the 
South African based newspaper the "Mercury" (September 18), says 
that the agreement has not brought any relief so that he "can 
re-enter a new democratic country in which the rights of citizens 
are respected." "I just don't see how it (the deal) will work," said 
Peta. Similar sentiments have been echoed by Wilf Mbanga, editor of 
the independent newspaper the "Zimbabwean." Mbanga, some of whose 
employees were tortured by state agents, says that there are no 
guarantees that his reporters will be allowed to work freely. 
Several foreign journalists entered Zimbabwe clandestinely to cover 
the signing of the agreement after the Ministry of Information 
refused to authorize their visits. No arrests have been reported but 
journalists that we have talked to are not working openly, fearing 
arrest. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT. The power-sharing agreement between the major 
political parties in Zimbabwe acknowledges the need for a free media 
environment, but fails to call for the necessary reforms. Its call 
for the closure of VOA and similar broadcasters clearly advances the 
ZANU-PF agenda. Unless the MDC gains control of the Ministry of 
Information we are skeptical about the prospects for real reform in 
the short term.  In any case, we will closely monitor developments

with respect to press freedom as the agreement is implemented. END 
COMMENT.
