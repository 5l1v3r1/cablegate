¶1. (SBU)  On June 11, POL M/C raised the issue of missing and 
detained American citizens in Iran with Dennis Horak, 
Director of the Iran Desk at Foreign Affairs Canada.  He 
asked Horak if Canada would raise this issue in discussions 
with Iranian officials. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Horak said Canada shared U.S. concerns fully.  It 
had intervened on several occasions on behalf of its own 
citizens who had been detained, harassed, and jailed in Iran. 
 In 2003, a Canadian had not only been arrested for taking a 
photo of a prison, but had been brutally beaten while under 
interrogation.  She later died in custody.  Horak was 
doubtful that an approach by Canadian officials would have 
much effect on Iranian authorities but said they would raise, 
both in Ottawa and in Tehran, the plight of the American 
detainees.
