LEBANON TRIBUNAL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 129919 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On September 18, DePolCouns and PolOff delivered 
reftel demarche encouraging Greece to make a contribution to 
the special Tribunal for Lebanon to Ambassador Alexandros 
Rallis, deputy head of the MFA D1 Directorate for 
International Organizations.  Rallis said Greece recognized 
the importance of the tribunal and that he had already made a 
recommendation to his minister to offer a donation.  Rallis 
said he argued that offering a contribution, however small -- 
"even if it's just one euro" -- was an important symbolic 
gesture of support for justice in Lebanon.  While Rallis 
believed that Greece would make some contribution, he was 
unable to say at what level.
