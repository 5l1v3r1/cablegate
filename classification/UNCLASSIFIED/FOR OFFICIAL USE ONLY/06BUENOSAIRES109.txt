(F) Gangs and other criminal elements roam freely day 
or night, and target Emboff and affluent residential 
areas for burglaries and crimes of violence against 
residents. 
 
DISCUSSION: The Chancery, EMR, DCR, and Mission 
apartments are located in the Recoleta-Palermo- 
Belgrano neighborhoods of the City of Buenos Aires. 
Houses are located in the Vicente Lopez, Olivos, La 
Lucila, Martinez, and Acassuso neighborhoods, in the 
Municipalities of Vicente Lopez and San Isidro (also 
known as Zona Norte) in the Province of Buenos Aires. 
 
Well-developed road and public transportation systems 
make affluent neighborhoods easy to access, and cars 
and motorcycles are readily available.  Gangs often 
operate out of the numerous slums, known as villas, 
located throughout the metro area, including downtown 
and adjacent to Embassy housing neighborhoods.  Police 
are sometimes reluctant to enter these villas except 
during large-scale raids. 
 
During 2005, there were muggings, attempted muggings, 
vehicle thefts and break-ins, home invasions, 
restaurant raids, grocery store raids, and bank 
robberies in the Recoleta/Palermo/Belgrano areas 
downtown.  The beginning of 2005 saw a continuation of 
apartment and office building burglaries and invasions 
in Palermo and Belgrano neighborhoods.   In the Zona 
Norte suburbs (Embassy houses), burglaries, home 
invasions, and other armed robberies continued to be 
common.  Zona Norte is also considered the center of 
kidnapping activity. 
 
¶2. (U) CRIME AMBIANCE (Emboff neighborhoods are): 
 
(C) Within walking distance (approx one mile) of high 
crime areas, which are perceived as unsafe because 
street crime and residential crimes are common day and 
night. 
 
DISCUSSION: Recoleta, Palermo and Belgrano are known 
for muggings, vehicle and apartment break-ins, 
bank/business/restaurant raids, pick pocketing, and 
street scams.  While these are affluent areas, they 
are bounded by poorer neighborhoods, including vQas 
(slums) such as the notorious Villa Cava.  They are 
also transient areas, crisscrossed by major 
thoroughfares.  The large park areas of Recoleta and 
Palermo are notoriously unsafe after dark.  While much 
of Belgrano is still respectable, parts of it have 
declined due to the economy. 
 
Police attribute many of the crimes that occur in the 
Zona Norte house neighborhood to residents of the 
adjacent slums.  Zona Norte is considered a special 
case due to the extremes of wealth and poverty present 
in the same area.  The Embassy neighborhoods are the 
most lucrative and suffer accordingly. 
 
¶3. (U) AGGRESSIVENESS OF CRIMINALS (Criminal 
perpetrators usually): 
 
 
 
(D) Do not avoid and may seek violent confrontation 
with occupants during burglaries, and are not deterred 
by police response to alarm or emergency phone call. 
 
DISCUSSION: Victims of home and business invasions are 
threatened and beaten until they reveal the location 
of their valuables.  Businesses are often robbed 
during working hours when cash and valuables are more 
likely to be on hand.  Bank and armored car robberies 
frequently result in shootouts.  Shootouts with police 
or security guards daily, and a policeman is killed 
weekly as a result of criminal activity.  Hostage 
situations occur in varying degrees several times a 
week, in Greater Buenos Aires.  The only criminals 
that normally do not engage in violence are the street 
scam artists that prey on tourists.  Even pickpockets 
will pull knives if confronted by a victim. 
 
¶4. (U) ARMING OF CRIMINALS (Criminal perpetrators 
usually are): 
 
(C) Carrying firearms (handguns or shoulder weapons). 
 
DISCUSSION: Guns are readily available and any 
criminal willing to confront a victim is armed. 
Handguns are most commonly used, but sub machineguns 
and military rifles (available for sale or rent) are 
also used.  Police raids often recover grenades and 
explosives in addition to pistols, rifles, and 
automatic weapons.  Criminals also use real and 
simulated explosives to threaten people and cover 
their escape (approximately one-third of Federal bomb 
squad calls in the city of Buenos Aires). 
 
Also see answer to number 3 above. 
 
¶5. (U) AGGREGATION OF CRIMINALS (Criminal perpetrators 
usually): 
 
(C) Operate in groups of two or four individuals, are 
disposed occasionally to be confrontational and 
gratuitously violent. 
 
DISCUSSION: Official police reporting, news stories 
and anecdotal evidence indicate that criminals Qmost 
always operate in groups, with two to five being the 
average size.  Larger groups have been used in 
robberies of banks, warehouses or large stores.  In 
periods of civil unrest, mobs of dozens to two or 
three hundred people have looted grocery stores and 
warehouses.  Children, with adult backup, are used to 
confront other children and are used by gangs to 
commit many crimes due to the lenient juvenile laws. 
Victims are beaten if they hesitate to hand over 
valuables or have too little to steal.  Victims are 
often shot or stabbed if they offer resistance. 
 
¶6. (SBU) DETERRENCE/RESPONSE OF POLICE: 
 
NOTE: Separate responses for Capital Federal (Embassy 
apartments) and Province (Embassy houses). 
 
CAPITAL FEDERAL (PFA): 
(C) Local police or neighborhood associations are 
generally ineffective at deterring crime and response 
to alarms or emergency calls are often too slow (15 
minutes or longer) to disrupt burglaries or invasive 
crimes in progress in Emboff neighborhoods; police 
have a mediocre record in apprehending suspects after 
the fact. 
 
DISCUSSION: Despite reorganization, a large percentage 
 
 
of Federal Police resources are devoted to public 
order, internal security, and administrative 
functions, leaving fewer resources to patrol the 
streets and fight crime.  This is a result of both 
actual taskings (demonstration activity) and 
institutional attitudes.  The redeployment of 
policemen away from banks and back to street corners 
is believed to have contributed to an increase in bank 
robberies (along with more cash in circulation). 
Checkpoints are a favorite, but ineffective, crime 
fighting tactic.  Follow-up investigations are limited 
due to lack of resources and an overwhelming number of 
complaints.  Both Federal and Provincial Police are 
often unmotivated to pursue criminals due to a 
dysfunctional judicial system that operates in slow 
motion and sets many offenders free (including repeat 
offenders). 
 
PROVINCE OF BUENOS AIRES (BONAERENSE): 
(D) Local police or neighborhood associations are 
totally ineffective in deterring or disrupting 
burglaries and other crimes in Emboff neighborhoods, 
and seldom are able to apprehend or arrest suspects 
after the fact. 
 
DISCUSSION: Records for the municipalities where 
Embassy houses are located show an increase in 
reported crime for 2005.  The Province of Buenos Aires 
is larger than many European countries and has a 
population of over 10 million, but a police force of 
barely 45,000.  Despite several attempts at 
reorganization, a large percentage of provincial 
policemen are still assigned to administrative or 
guard duties.  Checkpoints continue to be a favorite, 
but ineffective, crime fighting tactic.  Despite 
purges and internal investigations, it is still widely 
believed that policemen are involved in much of the 
criminal activity, which discourages people from 
reporting crimes or providing information, further 
reducing the effectiveness of the police. 
 
¶7. (SBU) TRAINING/PROFESSIONALISM OF POLICE: 
 
CAPITAL FEDERAL (PFA): 
(B) Police are generally professional, reasonably well- 
trained, but may have resource/manpower limitations 
that inhibit their deterrence or response 
effectiveness. 
 
DISCUSSION: The PFA is reasonably competent and 
organized but suffers from low funding, overwork, weak 
leadership, and corruption.  Working conditions are 
difficult and dangerous.  Police are often less 
assertive than necessary due to the lack of clear 
policy guidance and political support from the federal 
government.  Serious intra-mural rivalries and 
resulting lack of coordination within the force are 
continuing problems.  Corruption purges in the last 
two years, with and without cause, damaged morale. 
 
PROVINCE OF BUENOS AIRES (BONAERENSE): 
(D) Police are somewhat unprofessional and ill 
trained; they are demonstrably apathetic to alarms and 
investigation of incidents in Emboff neighborhoods; 
they have serious resource/manpower limitations that 
inhibit their deterrence or response effectiveness. 
 
DISCUSSION: The BA Provincial Police are in the midst 
of a reorganization, which will take time to produce 
benefits.  The current force comes from a system based 
totally on seniority with virtually no professional 
development after basic training.  Provincial Police 
have even fewer resources, lower pay, and more 
E 
 
 
dangerous working conditions than their federal 
counterparts.  The Provincial Police continue to 
suffer from purges and from frequent turnover in 
senior professional and political management.  Serious 
intra-mural rivalries and resulting lack of 
coordination within the force are continuing problems. 
Corruption is a major problem. 
 
¶7.  OSAC CRIME SAFETY REPORT: 
 
¶I. OVERALL CRIME AND SAFETY: 
 
The primary threat to life and limb in Argentina, 
especially Buenos Aires, is a traffic accident.  The 
use of seatbelts is mandatory. 
 
Crime is"," a serious problem in Argentina, but one that 
can be managed with common sense precautions. 
Criminal activity is concentrated in the urban areas, 
especially Greater Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Rosario, and 
Mendoza.  The wealthier parts of metro Buenos Aires 
experience high rates of property crime, with high- 
income neighborhoods often registering twice as many 
complaints as some of the poorer and supposedly more 
dangerous parts of town.  In the countryside, there 
have been a few tourists robbed in isolated areas and 
occasional burglaries of hotel rooms in resort areas. 
Highway robbery largely affects commercial vehicles 
and hijacking of inter-city buses is uncommon. 
 
Urban crime includes: pick pocketing / purse 
snatching, scams, mugging, express kidnapping, 
residential burglary, home invasion, thefts from 
vehicles (smash and grab), car theft and carjacking. 
Short-term visitors to urban areas are subject to all 
types of street crime, but report few problems with 
public transportation or with four and five star 
hotels.  Long-term residents are subject to the full 
range of criminal activity on the street, while 
driving, and at home. 
 
Express kidnapping (short duration / low ransom) 
continues along with conventional mugging.  Extortion 
kidnapping for ransom has so far only affected well- 
off Argentines.  The true rate of kidnapping is 
unknown, but probably lower than in Brazil, Colombia, 
or Mexico.  Virtual kidnapping, a telephone scam in 
which the caller claims to have kidnapped someone who 
is simply not at home, continues to be rampant.  Such 
calls often come from jails and the callers ask for 
prepaid phone cards, which are a form of money inside 
prisons. 
 
Most criminals are armed and ready to shoot at the 
first sign of resistance.  In Buenos Aires policemen 
are killed every week.  Crimes occur at all hours and 
armed robberies often take place during business 
hours.  Favorite targets for armed robberies are banks 
and businesses dealing in cash or high-value 
merchandise.  Apartment invasions and burglaries are 
common, and occasionally entire buildings are taken 
over.  Criminals often go through neighborhoods and 
apartment buildings ringing doorbells and robbing 
those who open the door. 
 
Argentina is still considered a transit country for 
drugs, but local consumption is increasing. 
 
II. POLITICAL VIOLENCE: 
 
There are daily demonstrations in Greater Buenos Aires 
and frequent demonstrations in other major cities. 
Most protests are related to domestic economic and 
 
 
political issues.  U.S. interests are targeted based 
on current events, such as the war in Iraq, IMF 
negotiations, economic policy, or policy toward Cuba. 
The largest and most disruptive protests are usually 
sponsored by the ""piqueteros"" (a collection of groups 
whose main tactic is to block the road).  In Buenos 
Aires, demonstrations most commonly occur downtown and 
often end up at the Plaza de Mayo, Casa Rosada, 
Congress, or the obelisk on 9 de Julio.  Protesters 
generally come from labor unions, 
unemployed/underemployed/landless movements, student 
groups, and communists.  While most protests are 
peaceful, there are hooligan elements that 
periodically show up to fight the police and engage in 
vandalism.  The Police are generally restrained unless 
attacked by hooligans.  In addition to the organized 
demonstrations, there are frequent, spontaneous 
protests by groups of displaced workers, bank 
depositors, unpaid pensioners, etc. 
 
Despite the poor perception of various USG policies, 
Argentines are friendly to Americans and visitors are 
unlikely to experience any anti-American sentiment. 
 
In recent years, there have been periodic pipe bomb or 
incendiary attacks.  During the past year, typical 
targets have been bank branches, municipal or public 
utility offices, McDonald's restaurants, and 
Blockbuster Video stores.  These incidents usually 
occur in the middle of the night and appear intended 
to cause only property damage.  A string of such 
attacks occurred shortly before the November 2005 
Summit of the Americas to protest the visit of 
President Bush. 
 
There is no known operational terrorist activity in 
Argentina, but the 1994 AMIA bombing and the tri- 
border area generate considerable interest.  The tri- 
border area is considered porous, but the known 
activity consists of fund raising and money laundering 
on the other sides of the border. 
 
III. POST-SPECIFIC CONCERNS: 
 
Argentina experiences occasional flooding along the 
coast, including parts of Buenos Aires, and in low- 
lying parts of the interior, such as Santa Fe 
Province.  Western/northwestern provinces, such as 
Mendoza, Salta, Jujuy, and Tucuman suffer from 
periodic earthquakes. 
 
Road conditions are good, but traffic is fast 
throughout the country and heavy in the big cities. 
Drivers are aggressive and the accident rate involving 
pedestrians is very high. 
 
IV. POLICE RESPONSE: 
 
Expatriates can generally expect better response and 
less harassment than in many other Latin American 
countries.  Individuals detained by the police should 
ask to contact their Embassy or consulate. 
 
Checkpoints are common, especially around Buenos 
Aires, and drivers must have all documentation, 
including passport or Argentine ID card, driving 
license, vehicle registration and proof of third-party 
liability insurance. 
 
POLICE EMERGENCY NUMBERS: 
 
CAPITAL FEDERAL POLICE:  101 or 4383-1111 through 1119

VI. SECURITY TIPS: 
 
CARRY CASH: 100-200 US$ or 300-400 pesos.  The people 
most likely to be beaten are those without enough 
worth stealing.  If confronted, offer no resistance 
and immediately hand over everything demanded. 
 
NO ROLEXES. 
 
Stay in the well lit, populated areas.  Avoid parks 
after dark.  Be alert to pick pocketing in tourist and 
shopping areas. 
 
Do not flash large amounts of cash, or carry expensive 
looking bags, briefcases, or laptop cases in public. 
 
Do not carry all of your important documents in your 
wallet or purse.  Carry a photocopy of your passport. 
 
Use ATM machines located in public places like the 
hotel, shopping mall, or event venue.  If the booth 
has a door, make sure it closes behind you. 
 
If you are in a restaurant or other business that gets 
robbed, follow the instructions of the robbers and 
hand over valuables on demand. 
 
MUSTARD ON THE BACK SCAM: Unknown to you, a liquid is 
squirted on your back.  After a few steps, someone, 
often a middle-aged woman, will inform you that you 
have something on your back and offer to help clean it 
off.  Meanwhile, she picks your pockets.  This scam is 
common in tourist areas such as San Telmo, La Boca, 9 
de Julio, Recoleta, and Florida Street.  Fortunately, 
this is one of the least confrontational crimes, just 
say ""NO"" and walk away. 
 
Pay with exact change as much as possible.  If you pay 
for a small item with a large bill, you risk being 
shortchanged or getting counterfeit in change.  Only 
take pesos as change. 
 
Use credit cards only at the hotel and major stores 
and restaurants.  Watch your bills carefully for 
fraudulent charges. 
 
TRANSPORTATION 
 
Remises (hired car and driver) are the best public 
transportation.  They charge by the kilometer and are 
 
 
reasonably priced.  Hotels, many restaurants, and 
shopping centers can call one from an established 
service. 
 
Radio taxis are also OK.  Taxis are black and yellow 
in the Capital, and white with blue lettering in the 
Province. 
 
Avoid black and yellow taxis with the word MANDATARIA 
on the door, and do not take rides offered by people 
on the street or outside an airport. 
 
In order of preference:  a) Call for a taxi, b) take 
one from an established stand, c) hail one on the 
street (but not in front of a bank). 
 
USE the seatbelts, lock the doors, and keep windows 
up. 
 
Subways, buses, and trains are safe but watch out for 
pickpockets and be ready for work stoppages. 
 
Watch your bags at airports, bus, and ship terminals. 
 
DEMONSTRATIONS 
 
Demonstrations are a daily occurrence in Buenos Aires 
and other large cities and towns. 
 
In Buenos Aires, demonstrations often occur in the 
downtown plazas, and near commercial and government 
buildings.  Roadblocks (pickets) on major roads 
leading into the larger cities are also common. 
 
Protests range in size from dozens to thousands of 
participants. 
 
Most protests are peaceful, but may be loud due to 
sound systems, drums, and fireworks.  The burning of 
effigies and flags is routine. 
 
There are hooligan groups that will sometimes 
infiltrate protests in order to fight the police and 
engage in vandalism. 
 
At soccer games, sit in the expensive seats and do not 
wear the colors of, or cheer for, the visiting team.
