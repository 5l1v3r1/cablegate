Date: 13 March 2007 
 
From: 
 
Islamic Republic of Afghanistan 
Ministry of Energy and Water 
 
To: 
 
The Honerable Ronald E. Neumann 
United States Embassy 
Kabul, Afgahnistan 
 
Re: 100 MW Power Plant 
 
Dear Mr. Neumann: 
 
As you are well aware, Kabul continues to face a crisis in the power 
sector.  The current power generating capacity is very low and 
customer power distribution is taking place on a very limited 
basis. 
 
The 220 kV transmission line (NEPS) is expected to take at least 
another two years before it can import power from the Central Asian 
Republics.  Furthermore, the amount of power to be imported is 
insufficient to meet the demands of Kabul. 
 
There is an urgent need to provide stable power to Kabul's 
customers, which include government agencies, diplomatic missions 
and public service agencies. 
 
On behalf of the Ministry of Energy and Water, we are requesting the 
Government of the United States to provide us with assistance in 
procuring a 100 MW power plant which included a complete substation 
to compliment our 110 kV network. 
 
We are grateful for all the assistance the United States Government 
has provided to Afghanistan in the energy sector. 
 
Yours truly, 
 
(Signed) 
 
Al-Haj Mohammed Ismael 
Minister of Energy and Water 
Islamic Republic of Afghanistan

3.(SBU) COMMENT:  To proceed with the project, Post will need to 
receive a letter from Finance Minister Ahady specifying a particular 
generator configuration and committing the GOA to pay $20 million 
toward the capital cost of the project and to pay for the operation 
and maintenance of the equipment, including the purchase of all fuel 
to run the generators.  We will advise the GOA of this requirement 
as soon after the Naw Ruz holiday as possible.  END COMMENT.
