¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) President 
Salva Kiir hosted the formal July 14 opening of the GoSS mediation 
initiative between the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and the 
Government of Uganda (GOU).  The head of the Ugandan delegation 
delivered brief, conciliatory remarks that pledged a good faith 
effort from the Ugandan side.  The spokesman for the LRA responded 
with what can only be described as a belligerent political speech. 
Closed-door sessions were slated to begin on July 15, but the tenor 
of the LRA remarks reportedly so upset the GOU delegation that they 
have balked at meeting further with their LRA counterparts.  End 
summary.

Kiir Gives his Blessing

¶2. (SBU) The formal opening of talks between the LRA and GOU kicked 
off two and one-half hours late in a caucus room of the Southern 
Sudan Legislative Assembly packed with press, the Council of 
Ministers, heads of the religious community, select diplomats, and a 
number of senior members of civil society.  After the opening 
invocations, Salva Kiir addressed the gathering, reiterating the 
GoSS desire that the Ugandans forgive and forget and seek a peaceful 
solution to their differences along the lines of the agreement 
forged between the North and South of Sudan.  He called on the 
African Union, IGAD, and the international community to provide 
support, especially in financial terms.  Kiir noted the ICC 
indictment of five senior LRA leaders and said that he was aware 
that some parties disapproved of the GoSS initiative; nonetheless, 
the GoSS was resolved to mediate.  Kiir said he had named a 
ministerial committee headed by Vice President Machar to handle the 
mediation process.  Kiir called on the media to work for peace and 
sacrifice journalistic scoops in favor of a positive outcome, which 
elicited titters.

Offering the Olive Leaf

¶3. (SBU) GOU Minister of Interior Ruhakana Rugunda spoke next, 
delivering off the cuff remarks from a page of handwritten notes. 
He said that the GOU had given its unqualified support for the GoSS 
effort and thanked Kiir for taking the initiative.  Rugunda said 
that the GOU was sincere and serious in its desire to negotiate a 
just settlement in spite of media reports to the contrary.  He said 
the GOU's declaration of amnesty for LRA members who would opt for 
peace demonstrated Uganda's commitment.

The LRA: In Your Face, Pal 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) LRA delegation leader Martin Ojul announced that LRA 
Spokesman Obonyo Olweny would deliver the LRA's opening statement. 
After praising the GoSS and thanking the Southern Sudanese for 
offering the hospitality of "their beautiful capital city," Olweny 
launched into a lengthy political speech blasting the Kampala 
regime.  He described Uganda as suffering from disunity, lack of 
democracy, political imbalance, and elitist greed.  He criticized 
the "hallmark of political greed and personal ambition" and said the 
GOU had sought to scapegoat those who objected to GOU misrule.  He 
predicted that the Great Lakes region was headed for a catastrophe 
if the political equation in Uganda was not addressed. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Olweny declared that the LRA was negotiating from a 
position of strength rather than weakness, and that the GOU would be 
in for a shock if it thought that it could resolve the issue with 
military force.  He cited the three options facing Kampala.  First, 
there was the dead-end option of military force; secondly, there was 
the attempt to indict LRA leaders.  He said that they could not be 
apprehended and accused the UN of being unfair and pre-judging the 
guilt of the LRA leadership.  He accused the UN of ignoring the 
depredations of the UPDF against the Ugandan population and 
concluded that the third option was negotiation.  The ceremony ended 
with an awkward handshake between Kiir and the heads of delegation.

Conclusions

¶6. (SBU) The mediation effort is off to a poor start.  While the 
GoSS attempted to dignify the LRA by rechristening them the "Lord's 
Resistance Movement/Lord's Resistance Army," the semantics did not 
disguise the fact that there is little love lost between the two 
Ugandan parties.  The GOU delegation was reportedly so incensed by 
 
KHARTOUM 00001675  002 OF 002 
 
 
the LRA harangue that they refused to attend the closed door session 
scheduled for July 15.  This was not a propitious beginning.
