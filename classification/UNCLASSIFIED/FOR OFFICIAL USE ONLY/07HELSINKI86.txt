REF: STATE 13840 
 
¶1.  (U)  Poloff spoke with Finnish officials at the MFA and 
in the Prime Minister's Office on February 6 and obtained the 
following reaction to certain issues likely to arise at next 
week's GAERC meeting. 
 
Iran 
---- 
¶2.  (SBU)  The GoF agrees that following the conclusions of 
the last GAERC, the EU should move forward quickly to 
implement UNSCR 1737.  Asset freezing and revocation of 
banking licenses of some financial institutions will be 
discussed at the upcoming meeting.  Finland is already 
reviewing any Iranian assets in Finnish banks.  The MFA 
opined that expanding cessation of export credits beyond 
those indicated in UNSCR 1737 is more complicated, and that 
EU members have different views on the efficacy and/or 
ability to do this.  The GoF is encouraged by recent signs of 
dissent among some domestic elements who seem to fear the 
Iranian regime in engaging in brinkmanship with the 
international community. 
 
 
Afghanistan 
----------- 
¶3.  (SBU)  The Finns expect the EU plan to create a new 
police training mission to be approved; whether the plan will 
be funded as fully as hoped is another matter.  FM Tuomioja 
will push for full funding at the meeting and has indicated 
that Finland will participate in the initiative.  Finland 
will also participate in an EU-Russia counternarcotics 
initiative aimed at beefing up border security and cutting 
off narcotics smuggling routes at identified choke points. 
 
 
Kosovo/Serbia 
------------- 
¶4.  (SBU)  The GoF fully supports UN Special Envoy 
Ahtisaari's recommendations.  EU Commissioner for Enlargement 
Rehn (a Finn) will visit Serbia Feb. 7-8 to urge Belgrade to 
form a new government as quickly as possible and to 
participate fully in negotiations.  The Finns expect the 
GAERC to produce a strong statement in support of Ahtisaari. 
 
 
Sudan 
----- 
¶5.  (SBU)  The GoF agrees that it is time for Bashir to 
follow through on his commitments.  The January 22 GAERC 
conclusions clearly stated the EU's readiness to forcefully 
support full implementation of all phases of UNSCR 1706.
