SUBJECT: ATIQULLAH LUDIN APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF LOGAR 
PROVINCE 
 
¶1.  (U) On October 23 former Mujahedin commander LTG 
Atiqullah Ludin took up his duties as the new governor of 
Logar Province just south of Kabul.  He replaced Abdullah 
Wardak, who was killed in an insurgent attack on September 
¶13.  In his initial address to Logar residents and officials, 
Ludin stressed that his top priorities will be improving 
security and bringing more reconstruction to the province. 
He pledged to consult with local elders on the establishment 
of a special police unit to prevent attacks, smuggling and 
kidnappings. 
 
¶2.  (U) Ludin, a Pashtun from Logar,s Mohammad Agha district 
that borders Kabul province, has been largely out of 
circulation for the last 3-4 years.  His principal 
qualifications to be Governor in increasingly strife-torn 
Logar appear to be his personal connection to the province 
and his military service.  In the early 1970s Ludin 
reportedly attended a military course and served in the 
Afghan army during the rule of Daoud Khan.  After the 
Soviet invasion, he moved to Pakistan.  Accounts vary 
concerning the degree of his possible involvement in fighting 
the Soviets, but after the fall of the Taliban, Ludin was 
active in southeastern Afghanistan as commander of the former 
Afghan 3rd corps (which predated the Afghan National Army). 
He worked closely with U.S. forces stationed at Gardez in 
Paktia Province.  After some initial hesitation by Commander 
Ludin, most of his forces entered the disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration program in 2003.  He was 
unsuccessful in his bid for a seat to the Lower House of 
Parliament (Wolesi Jirga) in the 2005 elections. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Ludin is directly related to President Karzai,s 
former Chief of Staff, Jawed Ludin (current Afghan Ambassador 
to Norway).  Jawed Ludin,s sister is reportedly married to 
the new Governor,s son.  UNAMA reports that three candidates 
were considered for the Logar governor slot and, because of 
his lack of managerial experience, he would not have been 
UNAMA,s first choice.  Ludin,s selection was submitted to 
and approved by the Senior Appointments Panel.  Unconfirmed 
reports suggest Ludin might have been involved at one time in 
antiques smuggling.
