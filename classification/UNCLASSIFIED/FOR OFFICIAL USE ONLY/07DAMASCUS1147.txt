SUBJECT:  IDENT DATA ENTRY ERRORS AT PORTS OF ENTRY 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  CBP inspectors at US ports of entry are 
apparently entering the terms "recidivist," "frequent traveler" and 
"unknown" into IDENT in place of actual traveler names and bio-data. 
 Clearing these entries causes extra work for consular officers and 
casts a negative light on legitimate passengers with repeat travel. 
POE registration of photos without actual bio-data undermines the 
purpose of NSEERS.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Embassy Damascus sees, on average, one or two "recidivist" 
hits daily in the IDENT system that have been entered by CBP 
inspectors at ports of entry.  However, these hits are nearly always 
(over 95 percent of the time) entered for people who have diligently 
registered with NSEERS, not the repeat offenders the word 
"recidivist" would suggest. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Recidivist hits, like Watchlist tags, are displayed 
prominently in the system message box that remains open on the 
background screen of the NIV application.  While clearing individual 
NSEERS registrants from the box is a minor annoyance, over time they 
have a "boy who cried wolf" effect on the officers they are meant to 
alert, especially in posts with large numbers of applicants for whom 
NSEERS is mandatory. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Another far more common problem is the frequency with 
which CBP inspectors enter applicants' names with the filler text 
"FREQUENTTRAVELER, FREQUENTTRAVELER" or "UNKNOWN," even on the 
individual's first trip to the US.  Given that the aim of the NSEERS 
program is to verify the entry and exit of all designated 
individuals into and out of the U.S., it would be very helpful to 
both DHS and DOS to be able to confirm that the person bearing the 
fingerprints used the same name at registration, especially since 
photos are sometimes blurry or absent.  Registering the traveler 
without the actual name seems counterproductive. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Finally, Post has seen a few instances of inappropriate 
comments entered with applicants' IDENT data.  Most recently, notes 
for an elderly woman in a wheelchair indicated that she was 
questioned specifically about whether she supports Al Qaeda, to 
which she replied that she did not.
