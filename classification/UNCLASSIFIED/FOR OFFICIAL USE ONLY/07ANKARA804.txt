¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: The Turkish MFA held a meeting with Embassies 
April 4 to describe its planning for the June 25 BSEC (Black Sea 
Economic Cooperation) Summit meeting of heads of state and 
government.  Turkey aims to use its chairmanship to revitalize BSEC 
as it commemorates its 15th anniversary at the Istanbul Summit. 
Embassy recommends that the Department send a senior official to 
represent Secretary Rice, who has regretted.  Both BSEC and Turkey 
support a U.S. proposal for a symposium on environmental protection, 
targeted for September or July, as a way to contribute as a new 
observer.  End Summary.

¶2.  (SBU) Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs Deputy Director 
General Multilateral Affairs Ahmet Asim Arar and BSEC Summit 
Coordinator Cetiner Karahan presented MFA's plans for the June 25 
BSEC Summit in Istanbul to Ankara based representatives of members 
and observers.  They noted that this will be one of the flagship 
activities under the Turkish BSEC Chairmanship that begins May 1. 
BSEC Deputy Secretary General Murat Sungar also attended the April 4 
meeting.  Here is the scenario under planning for events in 
Istanbul: 
 
-June 23-24: 
Committee of Senior Officials meetings - Conrad Hotel 
 
-June 25: 
Morning - Special meeting of Foreign Ministers - Ciragan Palace 
 
Luncheon for Ministers and Heads of State hosted by the GOT PM - 
Ciragan Palace 
 
Afternoon - Summit Conference - Ciragan 
 
Evening - Summit Dinner hosted by the GOT President - Dolmabahce 
Palace, followed by Bosphorus cruise 
 
-June 26: 
Separate CERA-TEMA organized "East Meets West" Energy Conference 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Turkey has invited heads of state from members and 
foreign ministers from observers.  Embassy recommends that the 
Department send a senior official to represent Secretary Rice in 
recognition of the USG's new observer status and our interest in 
using that status to contribute to revitalizing BSEC during Turkey's 
Chairmanship.  This would boost this organization aimed at fostering 
economic linkages and cooperation in this challenging region.  By 
helping Turkey build common ground during its chairmanship, we can 
help pull BSEC more together and towards the Atlantic.  (Note: We 
have conveyed Secretary Rice's regrets with intention to send a 
senior State Department official per Ref A.)  Observers' Ministers 
or his/her representative can attend all the events on June 25.  The 
expenses of the Minister or representative will be covered by BSEC.

U.S. Proposed Environment Symposium - Next Steps 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) DDG Arar and BSEC Deputy Sungar confirmed that the U.S. 
proposed Environmental Protection for Economic Growth Symposium was 
favorably received by the Environment Working Group in March in 
Belgrade, noting that it was now being circulated for comments. 
They agreed with the U.S. proposal that the symposium be scheduled 
before or after a meeting of the Environment Working Group to save 
travel expenses.  While the next scheduled working group meeting is 
in September, they said that it might be possible to schedule a 
 
ANKARA 00000804  002 OF 002 
 
 
special session in July, potentially facilitating early realization 
of the symposium.  Arar said that the GOT would be holding meetings 
on planning for its chairmanship which would include scheduling. 
The next steps for the U.S. proposed environment symposium are to 
firm up the funding and date and to identify speakers.
