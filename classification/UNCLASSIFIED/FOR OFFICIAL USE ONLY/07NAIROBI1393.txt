Subject:  Hijackings by Pirates off the Somali Coast 
 
Dear Mr. Ambassador, 
 
At the outset, I feel privileged to express my deepest 
appreciation for your assistance and understanding to 
enable us to overcome the current challenges that we face. 
 
To continue facing these challenges, the Transitional 
Federal Government (TFG) requests the assistance of the 
United States Government to interdict pirates hijacking 
commercial vessels off the Somali Coast.  In this respect 
we like to make a particular reference to the recent 
[begin bold] hijacking of the UNWFP contracted vessel MV 
Rozen [end bold].  We appeal to the Government of the 
United States to use all means possible to free this 
vessel and its crews. 
 
Please accept, Mr. Ambassador, the expression of my 
highest consideration and esteem. 
 
[signature] 
 
Ismael Mohamoud Hurreh 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation

¶2.  (U)  Somali pirates hijacked the MV Rozen off the 
coast of Somalia's semi-autonomous region of Puntland on 
February 25.  The vessel, a Kenyan freighter under 
charter to WFP, had discharged its cargo of relief 
supplies and was returning to Mombassa when attacked. 
The crew of six Kenyans and six Sri Lankans remains in 
pirate hands on board the vessel off the Somali coast.
