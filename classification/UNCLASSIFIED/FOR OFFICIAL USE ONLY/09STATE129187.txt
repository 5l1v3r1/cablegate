SUBJECT: ENGAGING COALITION PARTNERS TO QUICKLY REVIEW 
DRAFT MOU ON LIFE, SECURITY AND MOBILITY SUPPORT 
 
REF: KABUL 3981 
 
¶1. (U)  This is an action request (see paragraph 3). 
 
¶2. (U) Begin Summary:  Significant numbers of additional U.S. 
civilian personnel are now arriving in Afghanistan for 
deployment to all Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) as a 
critical element of our strategy.  To facilitate timely 
deployment of U.S. civilians at Coalition PRTs, Embassy Kabul 
continues to press Coalition partners to conclude bilateral 
Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) for the provision of Life, 
Security and Mobility Support to USG personnel at each 
country's facilities.  More than 50 U.S. civilians live and 
work at Coalition-led locations; however, arrangements for 
their accommodation and support remain ad hoc and informal. 
The USG is in the process of significantly increasing the 
number of USG civilians at PRTs and other field locations, 
including those operated by Coalition partners.  Assistant 
Chief of Mission Mussomeli recently presented draft MOUs to 
the ambassadors of Coalition partners which operate PRTs 
where the U.S. has or may seek to place civilians.  Embassy 
Kabul is now trying to conclude MOUs with each Coalition 
partner to facilitate our increased civilian deployments, and 
has requested that posts in Coalition partner capitals engage 
with Foreign Ministry officials to stress the importance of 
quickly concluding these agreements.  End Summary. 
 
¶3. (U) The following posts are requested to deliver the 
following talking points to the officials in the host 
government Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the highest 
appropriate level to emphasize the importance of concluding 
the MOU: Norway, Sweden, Germany, Hungary, Canada, the 
Netherlands, Lithuania, France, Spain, and Italy. 
Additionally, Embassy Wellington is requested to provide a 
copy of the draft MOU with New Zealand to the New Zealand 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the MOU will be 
emailed separately.  No action is required of the following 
posts in the following countries: Czech Republic, Poland, 
Turkey. 
 
BEGIN TALKING POINTS: 
 
-- The U.S. strategy in Afghanistan is focused on building 
the capacity of Afghan institutions to withstand and diminish 
the threat posed by extremism.  To achieve our shared goals 
in the security, development, and justice sectors, the U.S. 
is working to significantly increase the number of USG 
civilians at Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and other 
field locations, including those operated by our ISAF 
partners. 
 
-- Our Embassy in Kabul recently presented your government 
with a draft Memorandum of Understanding for the Provision of 
Life, Security, and Mobility Support to USG civilians 
stationed at facilities operated by your government in 
Afghanistan. 
 
-- The MOU, while not legally binding, would replace existing 
ad hoc arrangements with an agreed framework for the 
provision of support services to U.S. civilians located at 
PRTs or other facilities operated by your government. It 
would also provide a framework for USG reimbursement to your 
government for those services, where applicable. 
 
-- We understand that careful review of the MOU is required, 
but we urge your government to conclude the MOU as quickly as 
possible. 
 
-- We will be happy to relay any questions or concerns that 
you may have back to Embassy Kabul.
