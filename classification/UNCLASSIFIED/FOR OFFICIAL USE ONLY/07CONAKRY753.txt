¶1.  (SBU) Per reftels, post urged the government of Guinea to 
contribute to the upcoming UN/AU Hybrid Operations in Darfur.  On 
July 2, the Defense Attache discussed details of the hybrid 
operation with the General Secretary Charged with Exterior Relations 
at the Ministry of Defense.  The DATT underscored the importance of 
Guinea's participation in this peacekeeping operation.  The General 
Secretary promised that he would relay the message to the Chairman 
 
SIPDIS 
of Defense Staff General Diarra Camara. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The General Secretary later contacted the DATT by phone 
and informed us that the message was also relayed to the Minister of 
Defense General Bailo Diallo.  General Diallo reportedly did not 
dismiss the request and the Minister of Defense is interested in 
discussing the matter further.  General Diallo said that he would 
see President Conte later in the day and would discuss the issue 
with the Head of State who would make any decision on the matter. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) After discussing the possibility of participating in the 
Hybrid Operation with the DATT, senior officers were interested in 
learning more about the proposition.  In particular, the military 
wanted to know what type of training and equipment may be made 
available.  While Conte usually does not like getting involved in 
external affairs, the Ministry of Defense is considering the 
request.  Post will report any additional exchanges septel.
