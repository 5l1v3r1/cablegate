¶1. (SBU) Background:  In late September, the Sudanese Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA) did not grant, as requested by post, 
appropriate paperwork to allow Post personnel to meet an airQft 
carrying a classified pouch.  Compounding our problems, Air Egypt 
received instructions to forbid the USG courier from de-planing. 
However, Post was able to receive (but not send) the monthly pouch 
on September 28 despite the GOS attempt to prevent delivery (Note: 
The incident is described fully in reftels.  End note.)  As a result 
of the GOS failure to sign the required paperwork on a timely basis, 
Post established a policy of canceling pouch runs if the paperwork 
is not in hand at least 48 hours prior to the run.  It was 
determined that this period is needed in order to safely cancel a 
pouch run. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Second Attempt:  For the late October pouch delivery, Post 
requested that MFA sign the required paperwork to allow airport 
access.  Once again, the paperwork was not forthcoming in a timely 
fashion; however, owing to a general slowdown of work activity due 
to Ramadan, and early closure of the MFA for the Eid al Fitr 
holidays, it was impossible to determine conclusively that our pouch 
was actually refused admittance, or whether we had fallen victim to 
seasonal inefficiencies. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Current Situation:  On November 5, Post again submitted 
paperwork to the MFA for airport clearance to meet the pouch, which 
was due to arrive on November 9.  Once again, the documents remained 
unsigned at the MFA as of the COB on November 9, the day the pouch 
was to arrive.  On November 9, Charge Powers and Pol/Econ Chief 
raised the issue with MFA Under Secretary Mutriff Siddiq, who was 
surprised to hear of the matter.  Mutriff directed Deputy Director 
for the Americas Abdel Rahman Sharfi to follow-up and resolve the 
matter.  Sharfi promised to report back to the Embassy early next 
week. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In Ref A, Post requested approval of language for a 
diplomatic note to be sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  That 
request is still open.  Post recommends coordination with the 
Department of a high-level response to this situation if a solution 
is not agreed upon with the MFA by November 16. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Summary:  Post has been denied a classified pouch exchange 
on three occasions over the past two months.  There is a growing 
backlog of inbound and outbound pouch traffic that needs to be 
cleared.  But more importantly, the regular transmission of 
diplomatic information needs to be re-established and maintained 
consistently in conformance with Article 27 of the Vienna Convention 
on Diplomatic Relations.  Post believes that the difficulties now 
encountered with the diplomatic pouch stem from the Sudanese 
Government's lingering displeasure with the annotation of visas 
issued to President Bashir and his delegation when traveling from 
Havana to New York for UNGA. At 5:50 p.m. on Nov 9, the MFA 
contacted the Management Counselor to advise that the Ministry will 
provide gate passes for the next week's pouch delivery.
