¶1.  (SBU) We delivered reftel presentation on ceramic-lined 
valves to Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Relations (DFAIT) Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Policy 
Officer Kendra Davidson on September 13.  She expressed 
appreciation for the briefing and emphasized that Canada had 
raised the matter with the U.S. in an informational (vice 
case-driven) context. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Davidson asked whether it made sense to U.S. 
officials for AG partners to look at other alloys besides 
titanium which, she understood, could also be treated with 
ceramic coatings.  She also suggested that that we consider 
sharing our take on this matter with the British and the 
South Koreans, if we had not done so already, since both had 
raised it in discussions with GOC officials. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Davidson is available for further policy 
expert-to-expert discussion via phone: 613-944-1308, or 
E-mail: Kendra.Davidson@international.gc.ca.
