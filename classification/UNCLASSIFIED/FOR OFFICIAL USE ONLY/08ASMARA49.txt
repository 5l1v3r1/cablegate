SUBJECT:  SOMALI REFUGEES IN ERITREA 
 
¶1. (SBU) United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
Representative in Eritrea Vedasto Joseph Mwesiga and UNHCR Senior 
Protection Officer Alvin Gonzaga informed Emboffs that there are 
4,789 Somali refugees in Eritrea located in the Emkulu Camp outside 
of Massawa.  Mwesiga said that the majority of the refugees are 
members the Marehan sub clan from the Gedo region.  Gonzaga said 60 
percent of the refugees came to Eritrea prior to 2000 via Djibouti 
and were encamped near Assab.  The camp was moved to Massawa during 
the 1998-2000 border war after Assab was attacked by Ethiopian 
artillery.  The remaining 40 percent arrived almost entirely between 
the end of the border war in 2001 and 2003.  From 2004 through 2006 
approximately 60 new refugees arrived per year, but in 2007 the 
number increased to 208. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mwesiga said the refugees receive good treatment and 
reported no violations of human rights.  He also said food is 
provided directly to the refugees by UNHCR and each person receives 
2,100 calories per day. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Gonzaga said 60-65 percent of the refugees in the Emkulu 
camp were eligible for resettlement.  The Canadians are the only 
country agreeing to accept these refugees, and will receive 
approximately 100 over the next few months.  The Australians have 
interviewed some refugees, but have yet to accept them.  Both 
Mwesiga and Gonzaga expressed interest in the USG settling as many 
refugees from the camp as possible, but noted that DHS interviewers 
were not able to obtain Eritrean entrance visas when last tried in 
¶2004.
