END TEXT 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  The envisaged Romanian contributions to 
institutional development in Iraq - constituting diverse 
efforts by a total of six different ministries - reflect the 
GOR's genuine commitment to playing a constructive role in 
the development of a secure, prosperous and democratic Iraq. 
These contributions are especially significant at the 
present time given that the GOR's resources (limited at the 
best of times) are stretched thin as it copes with the 
financial, logistic and humanitarian impact of widespread, 
devastating flooding that has destroyed infrastructure and 
rendered thousands of Romanians temporarily homeless. 
Romania's support for "institutional reconstruction," 
together with President Basescu's pledge to maintain troops 
in Iraq "as long as necessary," underscore the depth of 
Romania's commitment to staying the course in Iraq.  End 
Comment.
