¶1. (U) On October 20, while receiving EUR DAS Tina Kaidanow in 
Yerevan, Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian handed over a letter

¶2. (SBU) Text: 
 
Madam Secretary, 
 
I would like to take the opportunity of the visit of Deputy 
Assistant Secretary Tina Kaidanow to Armenia and transmit this 
letter to your attention. 
 
It is my pleasure and honor to extend my gratitude to the State 
Department and to you, personally, for the crucial role you play, 
Madam Secretary, in the normalization process of Armenia-Turkey 
relations. I would like to thank you once again for your vital 
contribution during the signing of bilateral Protocols in Zurich. 
 
Please cnvey my high appreciation to Assistant Secretary Philip 
Gordon and US Ambassador to Armenia Marie Yovanovitch for all their 
efforts in support of this process. 
 
A last minute glitch caused by the Turkish side in Zurich clearly 
demonstrated that we now need to focus on the subsequent phases of 
normalization of relations in order to keep the positive momentum 
and prevent developments that can potentially derail the process. 
Armenia is committed to respecting its obligations deriving from the 
Protocols. 
 
I truly believe that once ratified and properly implemented the 
documents will provide foundation for the relationship between 
Armenia and Turkey and could be beneficial for the entire region of 
South Caucasus. 
 
Madam Secretary, 
 
After more than a year of hard work the sides reached very important 
but at the same time still very fragile stage of the normalization 
process and your support is very important not to lose the historic 
chance for reconciliation between the two peoples. 
 
I look forward to continuing our close and fruitful cooperation in 
pursuit of strengthening regional stability and Armenia-US friendly 
partnership. 
 
Please accept, Madam Secretary, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
Sincerely, 
/s/ 
Edward Nalbandian 
 
H.E. Hillary R. Clinton Secretary of State 
Of the United States of America Washington, DC
