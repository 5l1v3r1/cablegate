¶1.  (SBU) On November 1, we shared the U.S. proposal to 
consolidate and update existing bans on tied aid to CEE and 
FSU countries with Turkish Treasury Director General for 
Foreign External Relations Ersen Ekren.  Ekren's office 
generally provides instructions to Turkey's OECD Mission. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ekren said his staff would study the proposal 
carefully and, after discussing with Turkish Ex-Im Bank, get 
back to us before the November 25 Participants meeting.  He 
noted that Turkey has limited capacity to provide aid of any 
sort.  The only aid he is aware of to FSU countries is 
through Turkish Ex-Im Bank, and it is tied to some extent to 
procurement in Turkey.
