SUBJECT: PRC EDUCATION VICE MINISTER SUPPORTS PROPOSAL TO 
INCREASE NUMBER OF U.S. STUDENTS IN CHINA 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  PRC Education Vice Minister Hao Ping 
embraced a U.S. proposal to double the projected number of 
U.S. students studying in China to 100,000 over the next four 
years.  During an October 13 meeting with EAP A/S Campbell, 
Vice Minister Hao expressed hope to reach agreement on the 
proposal in time for President Obama's November visit to 
China.  Vice Minister Hao for his part argued for the 
creation of a high-level bilateral dialogue on educational 
and cultural exchanges and expressed interest in increasing 
the number of Chinese elementary school principals and 
teachers studying in the United States.  End Summary. 
 
U.S. Initiative to Increase American Students in China 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) During his October 13 meeting with PRC Education 
Vice Minister Hao Ping, EAP A/S Campbell outlined a U.S. 
initiative to increase the number of American high school, 
undergraduate and graduate students studying in China to 
100,000 over the next four years.  Noting the increase over 
the last few years of U.S. students studying overseas and in 
particular the sharp increase in the number of students 
studying Chinese language and culture, A/S Campbell 
underscored that this initiative would demonstrate the robust 
nature of U.S.-China relations and affirmed U.S. intentions 
to work with the Ministry of Education to develop a program 
to create a deeper engagement between U.S. students and China. 
 
¶3. (SBU) EAP DAS Shear noted that high school students would 
participate in short-term programs and study tours, and 
undergraduate and graduate students on long-term study 
programs.  Universities would receive grants to enhance 
existing programs or initiate new ones.  Without the 
initiative, the level of U.S. students studying in China over 
the next four years was estimated to reach 52,000.  The 
proposal sought to increase this by 48,000, of which 32,000 
would be undergraduate and graduate students.  The program, 
to be funded through a public-private partnership, would 
establish a stand-alone institution to provide funding for 
studies in China. 
 
Vice Minister Hao Welcomes the Initiative 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Stating he was "very encouraged" by the proposal, 
Vice Minister Hao praised President Obama's emphasis on 
education.  Vice Minister Hao said that the U.S. initiative 
would have a long-lasting impact on Sino-U.S. relations by 
enhancing mutual understanding and greater learning of the 
two countries' respective cultures.  He expressed hope that 
the two sides could reach consensus on the initiative before 
President Obama's visit, as it would have "an enormous 
impact" on the two countries' relations. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Hao cited progress since the onset of student 
exchanges during the period of Deng Xiaoping and President 
Carter, noting that over 400,000 Chinese students had studied 
in the United States since diplomatic relations were 
established.  Over 70,000 foreign students were registered in 
China, Hao reported, of which the greatest numbers were from 
Korea, Japan and the United States.  However, in the past two 
years, the United States had surpassed Japan in having the 
second-largest number of students.  Hao praised the numerous 
American universities with programs for overseas study in 
China, including Stanford University's campus at Peking 
University. 
 
Maximizing Cooperation 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) A/S Campbell said the U.S would provide details of 
the initiative to PRC and suggested both sides consider how 
to present the education initiative during President Obama's 
visit.  A/S Campbell invited Vice Minister Hao to the United 
States in 2010 to discuss programs to facilitate exchange and 
to hear his views on implementing these initiatives.  A/S 
Campbell suggested reporting progress on education issues in 
the context of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue.  Vice 
Minister Hao agreed on the importance of including the 
initiative in the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, adding 
that educational exchanges involved the least amount of 
dispute and confrontation and that both sides could reach 
consensus through minimal negotiation.

¶7. (SBU) Vice Minister Hao said he sought to increase the 
number of Chinese elementary school principals and teachers 
studying in the United States.  Vice Minister Hao underscored 
the importance of continued dialogue on people-to-people 
cooperation and reaching a consensus on the establishment of 
a PRC-proposed vice-premier-level bilateral annual dialogue 
on educational and cultural exchange (septel) during 
President Obama's visit.  A/S Campbell replied that while the 
idea of such a high-level dialogue was important, it might be 
best framed as an add-on to bilateral dialogues already 
underway. 
 
¶8. (U) Delegation cleared this cable.
