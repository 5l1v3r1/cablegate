MINISTER SHALOM AND VICE PREMIER PERES ARE DESCRIBED 
BELOW. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) THE CODEL MET WITH FOREIGN MINISTER SYLVAN 
SHALOM ON SUNDAY, MAY 29.  MINISTER SHALOM'S COMMENTS 
INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING POINTS: 
      A MAJOR SHIFT IS UNDERWAY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AWAY 
     FROM POLITICAL EXTREMISM TOWARDS MODERATION AND 
     DEMOCRACY.  EXAMPLES INCLUDE ELECTIONS (PAST AND 
     PLANNED) IN IRAQ, THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES, EGYPT, 
     LEBANON AND KUWAIT.  THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY NEEDS 
     TO EMBRACE MODERATES AND ISOLATE EXTREMISTS, INCLUDING 
     IRAN, SYRIA AND THE TERRORIST GROUPS. 
    HAMAS HAS BECOME A POTENT POLITICAL PARTY, AS 
SHOWN BY RECENT MUNICIPAL ELECTION RESULTS.  LIKE 
HIZBALLAH, HAMAS IS PURSUING POLITICAL POWER WHILE 
CONTINUING MILITARY ACTIVITIES. 
    REGARDING GAZA DISENGAGEMENT, THE PROCESS MUST BE 
CONTROLLED BY PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT MAHMUD ABBAS, NOT 
BY HAMAS AND OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS.  ABBAS MUST 
DISMANTLE TERRORIST INFRASTRUCTURE. 
    A MAJOR DILEMMA POSED BY GAZA DISENGAGEMENT IS 
WHETHER ISRAEL SHOULD DEMOLISH THE HOUSES NOW OCCUPIED 
BY SETTLERS.  DEMOLISHING THEM WOULD CREATE SPACE TO 
HOUSE MORE PALESTINIANS, BUT DEMOLITION IS OPPOSED BY 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
    ANOTHER DISENGAGEMENT QUESTION IS WHAT TO DO WITH 
THE PHILADELPHI CORRIDOR NEAR RAFAH, BECAUSE THE 
CORRIDOR HAS BEEN USED TO SMUGGLE WEAPONS FROM EGYPT. 
    THE SEPARATION BARRIER IS A TEMPORARY MEASURE. 
ISRAEL HAS MOVED TEMPORARY BORDERS WITH NEIGHBORS IN 
THE PAST AND COULD DO SO AGAIN. 
AIN. 
    IRAN IS STALLING FOR TIME TO DEVELOP ITS NUCLEAR 
CAPABILITY. 
 
¶6. (SBU) THE CODEL MET WITH VICE PREMIER SHIMON PERES 
ON SUNDAY, MAY 29.  THE VICE PREMIER EMPHASIZED SEVERAL 
THINGS THAT SHOULD BE DONE IN THE RUN UP TO GAZA 
DISENGAGEMENT AND ITS AFTERMATH: 
      FACILITATE MORE RAPID PASSAGE OF GOODS AND PEOPLE 
     BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. 
     ECONOMIC NEEDS MUST BE BALANCED AGAINST SECURITY NEEDS. 
    CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE SOCIAL SUPPORT 
NETWORK PROVIDED BY HAMAS.  PERES SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF 
THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY ESTABLISHING A PALESTINIAN 
FUND FOR SOCIAL WELFARE WITH FUNDING OF $10 MILLION PER 
MONTH. 
    TO INCREASE EMPLOYMENT, PROMOTE AGRICULTURE, WHICH 
IS THE MOST PROMISING SECTOR OF THE PALESTINIAN 
ECONOMY, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE GREENHOUSES IN THE 
GAZA SETTLEMENTS BE PRESERVED AND HANDED OVER TO 
PALESTINIANS INTACT. 
    ENCOURAGE TOURISM. 
    "PRIVATIZE PEACE" - THAT IS, USE PRIVATE SECTOR 
TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT TO PROMOTE PEACE, SUCH AS 
CH AS 
DEVELOPING QUALIFIED INDUSTRIAL ZONES AND BUILDING 
INDUSTRIAL PARKS. 
  THE VICE PREMIER ALSO COMMENTED THAT ISRAEL MADE A 
  MISTAKE BY INVESTING IN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES 
  (I.E., BUILDING SETTLEMENTS), WHILE OVERLOOKING 
  PROBLEMS AT HOME, INCLUDING UNDERDEVELOPMENT IN THE 
  NEGEV AND THE GALILEE.  ISRAEL NEEDS TO CORRECT 
  THESE MISTAKES BY PROMOTING HIGH TECH IN THE NEGEV 
  AND TOURISM IN THE GALILEE.  PERES CLOSED BY 
  REITERATING HIS CONTINUING GRATITUDE FOR AMERICAN 
  COOPERATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  HE STATED THAT 
  WHILE EUROPE TALKS, AMERICA ACTS.
