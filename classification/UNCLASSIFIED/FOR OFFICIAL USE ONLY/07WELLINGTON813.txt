RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 155063 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Pol/Econ Counselor contacted MFAT on November 13 
regarding New Zealand's stance on this USG-sponsored 
resolution, and to press for New Zealand co-sponsorship.  The 
UN Division's Wendy Hinton said that New Zealand was 
supportive of the resolution, but was unsure why New Zealand 
was not a co-sponsor.  She called back the Embassy to affirm 
GNZ support and said that the New Zealand mission in New York 
had been instructed to relay this message to the US 
delegation -- that NZ would support a robust resolution and 
be prepared to co-sponsor as long as the resolution remained 
true to its intention.  She speculated that perhaps the New 
Zealand delegation in New York was concerned that the 
possible amendments outlined in reftel would lessen the 
resolution's impact and therefore New Zealand would not want 
to support an amended resolution. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Pol/Econ Counselor advised that the USG is also 
concerned about unhelpful amendments, and urged that the GNZ 
vote against such amendments.  Hinton indicated that should 
countries propose amendments that would water down the text, 
New Zealand would oppose them.  Post suggests that USUN check 
with the New Zealand delegation to ensure that their 
instructions are consistent with MFAT's message to the 
Embassy.
