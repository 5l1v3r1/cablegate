 MFA Director for European Affairs Liliana Araujo told Dep 
Pol/Econ Counselor on November 28 that Portugal will continue 
to be a voice of moderation during the current debate on 
Turkey's Accession to the EU and reaffirmed Portugal's 
support for Turkey's EU membership. Recent press reports 
reflect Portugal's position, quoting FM Luis Amado as saying 
carefully "We have time to discuss (the issue)," on the 
sidelines of the recent EUROMED Conference in Tampere, 
Helsinki.
