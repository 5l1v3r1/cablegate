¶1. (U) Summary: Following last week's armed engagements in Omdurman 
between JEM and the GOS forces, Sudanese authorities have begun a 
widespread campaign of random arrests, detainee torture and 
newspaper censorship.  While many have been released, 150 
individuals remain under arrest, and one newspaper remains 
shuttered. End summary.

UNMIS CONFIRMS 200 ARRESTS, 3 EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2. (U) UNMIS Human Rights Team Leaders Marc Vincent met with poloff 
and OTIoff Monday, May 19 to discuss human rights issues following 
last week's fighting between rebels in the Justice and Equality 
Movement and government forces. Khartoum is awash in rumors that 
thousands of Sudanese have been arrested since the conflict.  UNMIS 
HR positively confirmed only 200 arrests, with 50 released after 
detention and torture, and 150 still held. Eyewitness corroboration 
and subsequent investigations have suggested that security forces 
performed three extrajudicial executions following the conflict - 
one Darfuri student pulled from his university dormitory, one 
Zaghawa woman protesting as police arrested her brother, and one 
adult beaten severely before dying. 
 
¶3. (U) UNMIS human rights told emboffs that released detainees' 
reports of their arrests are uniformly consistent. Authorities were 
targeting Darfuris, particularly Zaghawas, or those who bear a 
physical resemblance to people from Darfur. Pulled from buses or 
dragged from their homes in Omdurman, almost all were arrested 
because they were unable to produce immediate identification. One 
Sudanese lawyer who visited Khobar prison reported seeing about 140 
people, many of whom were bleeding, had broken limbs, and were 
naked; few could walk and none had received medical treatment. 
Sudanese authorities are not yet granting international 
organizations access to these prisons. 
 
¶4. (U) UNMIS human rights has requested access to the neighborhoods 
of conflict in Omdurman to investigate civilian casualties, but 
Sudanese authorities have granted access only to one site - a brick 
factory where JEM rebel mortar fire killed five civilians. The 
reinstatement of the curfew in Omdurman has limited information and 
access in and out of the sprawling Khartoum suburb.

SPG GUEST IN FEBRUARY, NISS "GUEST" IN MAY 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) Poloff spoke on May 19 with Abdelaziz Sam, general counsel of 
the Sudanese Liberation Movement and secretary of legal affairs for 
the Transitional Darfur Regional Authority. (Note: Sam visited 
Washington in February 2008 as a guest of the Sudan Programs Group 
(SPG), meeting with A/S Frazer and SPG to discuss Darfur peace 
process issues. End note.)  At 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, May 11, Sam and 
his relatives awoke to the sound of police officers kicking in the 
door at their home in Omdurman. Sam protested, saying he was a 
government official, and attempted to show his identification to the 
men. Sam and two male relatives were immediately arrested, bound 
with their hands behind their backs, and forced into a waiting 
vehicle of the central police force. During the journey, three 
officers of the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) 
administered a thorough beating to the men, opening wounds on their 
arms, backs and legs. Transported first to one location, beaten 
further, and then transported to another, the men were bound until 
7:30 that morning, when Sam was abruptly untied and led into the 
office of a NISS officer. The officer apologized for Sam's 
treatment, and Sam and his family members returned to Omdurman in a 
government vehicle. Sam suffered a concussion, bruises, and several 
deep wounds on his body.

NEWSPAPERS CENSORED BY SECURITY SERVICES 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Already restrictive, government censorship of media in 
Khartoum has increased since the fighting. Newspaper editors have 
reported that recently, censors are restricting the publication of 
any articles that refer to detention, human rights violations, and 
torture. The sensationalist Arabic daily "Alwan" published an 
article on May 14 detailing the possible loss of a Sudanese MiG-29 
during the fighting. Salah Gosh, head of NISS, issued a decree 
suspending "Alwan" from publication, freezing its assets and 
property, and also filed a police complaint against the editor. 
"Alwan" has not published since the alleged incident.

SUDANESE GOVERNMENT CONFIRMS ARRESTS, DENIES TORTURE 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶7. (U) On Tuesday, May 20, Charge Fernandez met with Adbelmoneim 
Taha, Rapporteur of the GOS's Advisory Council for Human Rights (and 
brother of VP Ali Osman Taha). Taha essentially confirmed UNMIS HR's 
numbers, stating that 69 individuals are currently being held by 
civilian authorities, and 90 other arrestees have not yet been 
handed over to civilian authorities for prosecution. Sudanese 
prosecutors plan that all arrestees will be tried in civilian 
courts, not in military courts. Taha added that over 400 people 
arrested during the initial sweeps were either released quickly, or 
were cleared and released after reviews of their cases. Taha denied 
that authorities had beaten, tortured or executed any individuals, 
saying that perhaps JEM fighters had donned Sudanese uniforms to 
execute civilians. 
 
¶8. (U) Comment: Sudanese authorities struggled to react coherently 
to the JEM attack and its aftermath, and the heavy-handed security 
services lashed out aggressively at Darfuri residents of Omdurman 
suspected of conspiring with or supporting JEM leader Khalil 
Ibrahim, throwing adherence to basic human rights aside.  Many 
observers expected the regime's reaction to be even worse, and the 
government does appear to be taking a less aggressive stance this 
week, however reports of continued sporadic detentions persist. 
That the government and UNMIS Human Rights agree on the approximate 
number of arrestees still under detention is positive and shows a 
degree of collaboration; the next task for UNMIS will be to gain 
access to the detained and ensure they receive fair trials in 
civilian courts.
