SUBJECT:  INDONESIA PLANS TO RAISE FOOD SECURITY AT UNGA 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  A Senior Official at the Ministry for Foreign 
Affairs (DEPLU) confirmed that Indonesia plans to raise food 
security during the high-level meetings at the UN General Assembly 
in September.  The Government of Indonesia (GOI) is primarily 
focused on generating increased investment in agriculture from the 
international community.  The Coordinating Ministry for Economic 
Affairs is currently developing a strategy to improve agriculture 
production and ensure food security in Indonesia.  DEPLU requested 
US technical assistance to improve Indonesian farmers' access to 
technology and to train young diplomats in negotiating international 
agreements.  End Summary. 
 
GOI to Raise Food Security at Upcoming UNGA 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The GOI plans to raise food security issues at the high 
level meetings of the UN General Assembly in September, according to 
the Director of Trade, Industry, Investment and IPR at DEPLU.  GOI 
officials are still discussing the most effective way to purse the 
issue at the September meetings.  The primary objective of the GOI 
is to secure the international community's commitment to increase 
agriculture investment in developing nations.  The official worried 
that the recent drop in oil and commodity prices might remove some 
urgency within the international community on the need to improve 
agriculture production in poorer nations.  He also noted that 
Indonesia is concerned that some of the support promised to 
developing countries at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's 
High-Level Conference on Food Security in June would be provided as 
soft loans rather than grants. 
 
Coordinating Ministry Developing Food Security Plan 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to the DEPLU official, the Coordinating Ministry 
for Economic Affairs has been tasked with developing a comprehensive 
plan to improve agr"iculture production in Indonesia.  The details of 
the plan, which is expected to be announced before the end of the 
year, remain vague.  However, the official noted that the GOI is 
considering policies to improve irrigation and to restrict the 
conversion of rice paddies for non-agricultural purposes.  He did 
not expect significant progress on the use of biotechnology in 
Indonesian farming. 
 
DEPLU Requests Technical Assistance for Farmers, Diplomats 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The DEPLU official requested US technical assistance to 
improve access to technology for small-scale farmers and to train 
young diplomats in negotiating international agreements.  He noted 
that majority of Indonesian farmers remain hostage to irregular 
weather patterns, which cause significant damage to crops every 
year.  He urged the United States to consider technical assistance 
programs aimed at improving irrigation systems and access to 
technology for small-scale farmers.  The official also inquired 
about US assistance in training young diplomats in negotiating 
techniques and in understanding legal issues related to 
international agreements.  In his view, this investment would help 
improve the pace and quality of trade and other bi-lateral and 
multi-lateral negotiations.
