SUBJECT:  FRANCE: CHARLES DE GAULLE AND WASHINGTON-DULLES AIRPORTS 
DISCUSS NEW COOPERATION ON SECURITY 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Post wishes to highlight an innovative proposed 
"sister-airport" link between Paris' Charles de Gaulle (CDG) airport 
and Washington-Dulles airport.  The idea -- for a limited 
information and "best practices" exchange -- was originally 
formulated in November 2005 by Dulles security officials during a 
visit to the airport by a French delegation from the French Civil 
Aviation Authority (DGAC).  A two-member delegation from Charles de 
Gaulle Airport (CDG) followed up with a visit to Dulles in May 2006 
designed to familiarize them with its operations, allow them to 
discuss French procedures, and further discuss the possibilities of 
improving information exchange and "best practices," particularly in 
the domain of airport and passenger security, to potentially include 
issues such as procedures, technology, training, and 
administration. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post has been discussing this concept with airport and 
security officials responsible for CDG since January 2006, and it 
has met with a uniformly positive response.  Post also finds much to 
applaud in the idea.  Given our aviation security agenda and the 
difficulties we at times experience in ensuring GOF cooperation, we 
need to take the lead in promoting our willingness to exchange ideas 
and establish cooperation on security in a variety of fora. 
Moreover, a local initiative such as this could improve US-French 
cooperation without the bureaucratic obstacles on the French side 
that have limited the flow of information via the mandatory 
inspection process.  It should give the Embassy a better 
understanding of French security practices, and might provide us 
with allies that could be useful in overcoming GOF roadblocks that 
have restricted US access to French airports to the bare minimum. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Post strongly recommends that the Department, DHS and TSA 
help facilitate this proposal.  We encourage Washington agencies to 
contact Donald MacGregor Ross Deputy Federal Security Director, 
Washington Dulles International Airport to discuss the idea: (703) 
662-2264 (desk), (202) 365-5986 (cell), don.ross@dhs.gov.
