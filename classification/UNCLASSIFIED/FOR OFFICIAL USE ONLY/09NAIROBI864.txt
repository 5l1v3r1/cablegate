SUBJECT: SOMALIA - Meeting with the TFG Minister of Humanitarian 
Affairs 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) On April 23, we met for the first time Mohamoud Abdi 
Ibrahim, Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Resettlement for 
Somalia's Transitional Federal Government (TFG).  Ibrahim was 
appointed in February and was an active member of the Alliance for 
the Re-liberation of Somalia and participated in the Djibouti 
Process.  The Minister initiated the meeting to establish a positive 
working relationship with the U.S. as Somalia's largest humanitarian 
donor.  After multiple requests to former President Yusuf's 
government for a humanitarian liaison, with Minister Ibrahim's 
appointment, President Sharif made a break from the past.  Ibrahim's 
priorities are to improve security and access for humanitarian 
agencies, coordinate humanitarian activities for the TFG, and build 
the institutional capacity of his ministry.  We should consider 
funding an advisor to the ministry to improve his ministry's 
functioning and cooperation with the donor community.

Introductory Meeting

¶2.  (U) On April 23, PolOff and USAID Regional Food for Peace 
Officer met with Dr. Mohamoud Abdi Ibrahim, Minister of Humanitarian 
Affairs and Resettlement for the Transitional Federal Government 
(TFG) in Somalia.  The Minister requested a meeting with U.S. 
government officials to discuss his ministry's priorities and to 
initiate coordination on humanitarian issues.  While in Nairobi, he 
also met with UN and other donor representatives.

Outlining Ministry Priorities 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) The Minister announced his three priorities: 1) improve 
security and access for humanitarian agencies; 2) coordinate 
humanitarian activities for the TFG; and 3) build the institutional 
capacity of his ministry.  Ibrahim indicated that at present, like 
in most of the TFG's ministries, there is limited staff and even 
more limited expertise on humanitarian issues.  The Minister 
mentioned he was preparing a capacity-building plan for his 
ministry. 
 
¶4.  (U) We responded that improved security would allow the 
expansion of humanitarian aid into areas currently considered too 
dangerous for our partners to operate.  He agreed that by simply 
improving security, the TFG could expand operating areas for 
agencies on the ground.  We noted that this would help increase the 
absorptive capacity of our partners which is currently a serious 
impediment to a more robust humanitarian response.  The minister 
also stressed that security must go hand in hand with peace-building 
initiatives. 
 
¶5.  (U) The Minister emphasized that he views his coordination 
function not as controlling humanitarian assistance but "ensuring 
support to vulnerable people."  We discussed the importance of 
ensuring aid is not seen as favoring any one group over another but 
is disbursed impartially based on need.  Minister Ibrahim assured us 
that he intended to maintain a positive working relationship with 
humanitarian agencies. 
 
¶6.  (U) As Minister Ibrahim was not familiar with the ways in which 
the U.S. typically delivers humanitarian and development assistance, 
we explained our practice of working through NGOs and UN agencies to 
advance shared TFG and donor priorities.  Ibrahim said that his 
government does not see itself in competition with aid agencies, but 
rather as a partner who can help ensure more effective humanitarian 
assistance.

¶7.  (SBU) The Minister is an ARS official who left Asmara with 
Sharif during the Djibouti Process.  Ibrahim's appointment as 
Minister represents his first political position.  He is an 
educational administrator by training and holds a PhD in Education. 
He previously served as a lecturer and served at the Ministry of 
Education in Siad Barre's government.  Ibrahim founded the Educated 
Somalis Forum.  He told us he was from Mogadishu and, other than his 
stint with Sheikh Sharif and the ARS in Asmara, has always been 
based in Somalia.  With his limited command of English and exposure 
to Western nations, Ibrahim is a surprise appointment as a liaison 
with the international donor community but he appeared frank and did 
use the empty rhetoric of many of the self-appointed liaisons we 
have seen in the past.  Ibrahim's family lives in Burao, Somaliland.

Comment

¶8.  (SBU) The minister conveyed a sincere desire for a positive 
working relationship with the United States and other donors and 
humanitarian agencies.  For the international community, frustrated 
after multiple requests to former President Yusuf's government for a 
humanitarian liaison and several failed attempts to establish one, 
Minister Ibrahim's appointment is a refreshing break from the past. 
We are heartened to see a minister - who at least in words - is 
expressing the same sentiments as the larger humanitarian community. 
 While it is too early to tell how effective this ministry will be, 
his tone suggests a willingness to play a constructive role on 
humanitarian issues.  It is an ideal opportunity for the United 
States to support (and fund) an advisor for the Minister to enhance 
communication and collaboration to more effectively deliver 
humanitarian assistance.
