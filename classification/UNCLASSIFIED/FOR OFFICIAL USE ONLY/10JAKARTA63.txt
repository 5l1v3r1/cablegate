SUBJECT: ENGAGING HEALTH MINISTER ENDANG IN GENEVA ON 
NAMRU-2 AND THE IUC 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive But Unclassified. 
Please handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) This is an action message.  The GOI extended 
visas for NAMRU-2 personnel through March 15, 2010 to 
allow negotiations to form a joint center for research, 
the Indonesian-United States Center for Biomedical and 
Public Health Research (IUC).  Health Minister Endang 
Rahayu Sedyaningsih has welcomed a USG negotiating 
team in early February to pursue this matter.  A key 
issue in those negotiations will be the continued 
involvement of U.S. Navy scientific resources and 
personnel in the IUC--a matter of considerable 
sensitivity for the GOI.  In a January 14 meeting, 
Ambassador Hume pressed Minister Endang to pursue a 
solution that includes keeping the Navy's medical 
research capabilities in Indonesia.  (See septel for a 
report of that meeting.)  Key to our strategy will be 
the need for USG officials to reiterate this message 
to Minister Endang and other GOI health officials. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Embassy Jakarta suggests the following 
talking points for the U.S. delegation that will 
travel to Geneva on the occasion of the World Health 
Organization (WHO) Executive Board Meeting 18-23 
January to use in a bilateral meetings with Minister 
Endang and other members of the GOI delegation. 
 
Begin suggested talking points: 
 
-- President Obama and President Yudhoyono called for 
deepening U.S.-Indonesia cooperation in combating 
infectious diseases when they met in November on the 
margins of APEC in Singapore. 
 
-- Health cooperation is an important part of the 
U.S.-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership and a 
critical priority for both countries. 
 
-- Establishing the Indonesia-U.S. Center for 
Biomedical and Public Health Research (IUC) provides 
an ideal platform for long-term engagement on 
infectious disease research and applied public health 
solutions that will benefit both countries. 
 
-- The USG anticipates the IUC will provide a platform 
for comprehensive engagement on other health issues 
involving several U.S. government agencies and 
programs and will be highlighted in President Obama's 
possible visit to the Indonesia. 
 
-- We have a short time to reach agreement on the IUC. 
Visas for U.S. Navy personnel have been extended until 
March 15.  Given the logistical and personnel matters 
involved, we need to reach a decision by mid-February. 
 
-- The continued participation of U.S. Navy scientific 
resources and personnel will be critical to the IUC's 
success. 
 
-- If the Navy does not participate in the IUC, the 
overwhelming majority of USG funding and personnel 
available for the center would not be available.  The 
USG cannot transfer these resources from the Navy to 
another agency. 
 
-- We look forward to upcoming negotiations to find a 
way forward that retains U.S. Navy participation in 
the IUC. 
 
End suggested talking points.
