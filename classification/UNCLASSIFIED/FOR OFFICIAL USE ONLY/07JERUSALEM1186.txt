REF: JERUSALEM 1179 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Heavy factional fighting continues in 
Gaza City and central Gaza as of mid-day local. 
Approximately 8 Palestinians have been killed so far today 
(since midnight): 3 "Executive Force" fighters in a &work 
accident8, 2 Fatah militia in Gaza City, and 3 National 
Security Forces (NSF) soldiers in Gaza City and Netzarim. 
Most PASF installations in northern Gaza (Bayt Lahiya, Bayt 
Hanun and Jabaliya) are reported to be in Hamas hands, and 
Hamas forces dominate Gaza City outside the main Palestinian 
security forces (PASF) and Presidential compounds. 
Gaza-based UN contacts report &a 50-percent return for 
normalcy8 for stores and markets early June 13.  End summary. 
 
Security Situation 
------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In northern Gaza, security contacts report that 
Hamas controls all key roads and most PA/security buildings 
in Bayt Hanun, Bayt Lahiya and Jabaliya, and took over all 
major NSF bases there yesterday.  In Gaza City, Hamas 
controls most major streets and intersections.  There is 
infrequent but sustained mortar fire and sporadic small 
arms/RPG fire at the PG/Force 17 bases around the 
Presidential compound and the NSF HQ at al-Saraya.  The Tal 
al-Hawa Preventive Security (PSO) HQ and General Intelligence 
(Mukhabarat) HQ in al-Sudaniya also report being cut off by 
Hamas and subject to harassing small arms/mortar/RPG fire. 
Hamas fighters are besieging Muqawsi towers, home of several 
senior Fatah/PASF leaders including Gaza Fatah spokesman 
Maher Miqdad and Field Committee Chair Majid Abu Shammali. 
(Late reports indicate that Hamas forces captured the towers, 
but Miqdad escaped).  Hamas took over a Bahariya (Coastal 
Patrol) installation near Beach Refugee Camp, and are 
besieging a Mukhabarat office/command residence there. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Extensive clashes are reported in central Gaza as 
well, focused on fighting between Fatah militia/NSF on one 
side against Hamas fighters in the Nussayrat and al-Mughazi 
Refugee Camps and Dayr al-Balah streets. 
 
 
NSF, Fatah Militias Doing Most Fighting 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The NSF is generally fighting aggressively against 
&Executive Force8 and Hamas military-wing fighters, 
according to PASF contacts.  NSF and Mukhabarat contacts 
report a desperate need for weapons and ammunition.  The 
Presidential Guard (PG) and police have had minimal roles in 
Gaza fighting since Monday, with PASF contacts reporting the 
NSF and Fatah militia doing most of the fighting. 
 
 
Abu Mazen Calls for Ceasefire; 
Hamas Mil-Wing Calls PASF "Traitors" 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Gaza contacts report wide anticipation of President 
Abbas, (Abu Mazen) speech scheduled for this afternoon. 
Many expect a call for a state of emergency or pullout from 
the NUG, but POL/security contacts doubt how effective either 
step would be in restoring security in Gaza.  Abbas, 
previous calls for all Palestinians to stop fighting and 
observe the ceasefire were printed in Arabic-language 
dailies.  A separate statement from the President,s office 
accused &some Hamas political and military leaders (of 
being) involved in current planning to overthrow legitimate 
Palestinian institutions, living in the illusion that they 
can take control of Gaza by force.8 
 
¶6.  (U) PM Haniyah also called for all factions to end 
fighting and resume negotiations, but tacked on a statement 
accusing Fatah of not believing in political partnership and 
seeking to disrupt Palestinian society.  Other Hamas 
spokesmen issued statements critical of Fatah that called for 
Hamas fighters to be firm in their determination "to 
eliminate the traitors," and that Hamas &had lost its 
patience with useless negotiations after so many of its sons 
and brothers were killed.8 
 
 
All Crossings Closed 
-------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) UN and EU-BAM contacts report that all crossings 
are closed, including Erez, except for specially-coordinated 
 
JERUSALEM 00001186  002 OF 002 
 
 
humanitarian cases.  Four Palestinian USAID employees and 
their families were able to depart via Erez this morning. 
 
 
Minimal West Bank Violence So Far 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) There has been minimal spillover of fighting to the 
West Bank so far.  West Bank Hamas political leaders have 
been low-key and conciliatory in released statements.  PASF 
commanders say they are closely monitoring Fatah-aligned 
extremists in the West Bank to stop retaliatory attacks.
