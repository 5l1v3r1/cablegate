SUBJECT: MSF Evacuates Staff in North Darfur Following Attacks on 
Compounds 
 
¶1. (U) On August 1, the humanitarian organization Mdecins Sans 
Frontihres (MSF) announced that it had suspended activities and 
evacuated staff from Tawila and Shangil Tobaya in North Darfur, 
following violent attacks on MSF compounds.  In two separate but 
similar attacks, groups of armed men entered MSF compounds at night, 
held staff at gunpoint and stole money set aside for salaries as 
well as other valuables.  It is unclear if or when MSF activities in 
Tawila and Shangil Tobaya will resume. 
 
¶2. (U) As a result of the withdrawal, MSF estimates that tens of 
thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs)in North Darfur will 
be without medical assistance.  In Tawila, MSF was the only medical 
organization providing medical care to more than 30,000 IDPS living 
in three camps, as well as the local population.  In Shangil Tobaya, 
MSF provided medical services for 28,000 IDPs in two camps and 
another 5,000 people in surrounding villages. 
 
¶3. (SBU) This is not the first time that MSF has suspended activity 
in either Tawila or Shangil Tobaya for security reasons.  During the 
past year, the team in Tawila was been evacuated twice after being 
targeted by assailants on three occasions, according to MSF.  In 
addition, MSF suspended activities in Shangil Tobaya for several 
months in 2007. In a statement, MSF Head of Mission in Darfur Monica 
Camacho called the latest suspension "a difficult decision" but 
noted that "it is impossible for our teams to work and provide 
medical aid without a minimum guarantee of security and respect for 
humanitarian work."  Despite the localized evacuations, MSF 
maintains approximately 1,500 humanitarian staff throughout other 
parts of North, South, and West Darfur.  Jose Hulsenbek, MSF/Holland 
Head of Mission in South Darfur, told aidoff that programs in South 
Darfur are continuing under normal operations. 
 
¶4. (U) In response to MSF's evacuation, on August 1 UN 
Undersecretary for Humanitarian Affairs John Holmes called upon 
armed opposition groups as well as government forces to ensure 
security throughout Darfur.  He noted that in 2008, 180 humanitarian 
vehicles were hijacked, 145 aid workers kidnapped, and nine aid 
workers killed.  "Impunity for such attacks must end," he said in a 
statement. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: MSF prides itself on being one of the most 
expeditionary NGOs providing emergency medical care on the 
frontlines of armed conflict.  Considering that it still operates in 
areas of Afghanistan and Iraq, its pullout signals the extent to 
which security has deteriorated in areas of Darfur.  Sadly, this 
trend shows no sign of being reversed, as attacks on humanitarian 
workers continue to be committed in Darfur at an alarming rate.
