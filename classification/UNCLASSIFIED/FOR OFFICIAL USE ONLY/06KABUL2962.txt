 ¶1.  (SBU) At the June 28 pre-meeting before the bi- 
weekly DIAG Forum, Japanese Ambassador Okuda briefed 
international representatives on plans for the July 
5 DIAG Conference in Toyko.  In addition to the 
planned presentations (DAS Gastright is listed as 
presenting on the ANA), Canada, the Netherlands, 
Russia, and the EU have all requested to speak. 
They will be accommodated in a late afternoon 
session, before the closing discussion. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Okuda noted that this is not a pledging 
session.  The purpose is to reaffirm the commitment 
of both the Afghan government and international 
donors.  He did say that while Karzai is in Japan, 
the Japanese government intends to make an 
announcement regarding a contribution to CNTF, ANBP, 
and/or LOTFA. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Also in the pre-meeting, UNAMA DSRSG 
Alexander said that DIAG is making some limited 
progress in three of the six Phase I provinces: 
Kapisa, Laghman, and Takhar.  He noted that in those 
areas where disarmament is making progress, the 
Joint Secretariat needs to follow up with 
development assistance.  (Note:  Funds for 
development in disarmed areas are provided by the 
Japanese government but administered through the 
GOA.  End note.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) ANBP,s Peter Babbington reported that it 
has been decided to begin the DIAG process in three 
Phase II provinces (vice an original list of eight). 
These are Bamian (July 19), Sar-e Pul (July 30) and 
Nangarhar (August 9).  He said there is a good 
chance of success in these provinces, which also 
bring the DIAG process into areas outside the north, 
including a Pashtun province.  This decision was 
also briefed by GOA officials in the DIAG Forum. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Following strong pressure from the Japanese 
Embassy, UNAMA, and the DIAG Commission, the Afghan 
Office of the Spokesman to the President on June 29 
released the following statement, affirming the 
President Karzai,s support for the DIAG program. 
 
¶6. (U) Begin Press Release:

Regarding the conference, the President said, "In 
spite of many difficulties and concerns, the 
Government of Afghanistan stands firm to continue 
DIAG, believing that DIAG is inevitable for ensuring 
the rule of law in Afghanistan." 
 
"Backed by (the) Afghan people,s strong desire to 
get ride of all the illegal armed groups in 
Afghanistan and to make this country safe and 
prosperous, the Government of Afghanistan has 
committed itself to accomplish DIAG at any cost." 
 
"While many obstacles lie ahead, I am fully 
committed to achieving the benchmark of DIAG as 
stipulated in the Afghanistan Compact.  The 
Government of Afghanistan will not allow any 
disruptions to the implementation of (the) DIAG 
programme." 
 
During his official visit to Tokyo, the President 
will meet with H.E. Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime 
Minister of Japan, H.E. Taro Aso, Minister of 
Foreign Affairs of Japan, H.E. Kanzaki, Head of 
KOMEI Party and the House of Representatives to
