SUBJECT: French have no response to US Proposal to Change GNEP into 
INEF 
 
REF: State 106834 
 
Â¶1. (U) The French accepted without substantive response our 
non-paper on the U.S. proposal to change the Global Nuclear Energy 
Partnership (GNEP) into the International Nuclear Energy Framework 
(INEF).  Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Policy Division, and the Ministry of Ecology, 
Environment, Sustainable Development and Oceans (MEEDDM) offices 
handling international nuclear issues had no immediate response. 
The French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) readily responded that 
they were already familiar with the proposal, and the Chairman of 
the CEA, Mr. Bigot, looks forward to discussing the proposal with 
the US delegation soon.
