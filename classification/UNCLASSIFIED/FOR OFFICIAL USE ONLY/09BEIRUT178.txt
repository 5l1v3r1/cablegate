SUBJECT: CODEL KERRY VISIT TO LEBANON: KEY MESSAGES 
 
¶1. (SBU) Senator Kerry, welcome to Lebanon.  Your visit 
provides an excellent opportunity to reinforce our message of 
strong, continued bipartisan U.S. support for a sovereign 
Lebanon.  You are the first Senator to visit since President 
Obama took office and your visit comes a few days after the 
February 14 fourth anniversary of the assassination of former 
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. Your visit will provide 
a strong message of U.S. support for the moderate voices of 
the Cedar Revolution that continue to seek justice, 
democracy, and accountability in Lebanon. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During your meetings with senior officials and 
comments to the media, we suggest you convey the following 
messages: 
 
-- The U.S. is committed to a sovereign, independent and 
democratic Lebanon. 
 
-- We want to see the legitimate institutions of the state 
strengthened for the benefit of all Lebanese, including the 
judiciary and the Armed Forces. 
 
-- The elections in June are vital for Lebanon's future. They 
must be carried out in a way that is transparent, fair and 
peaceful.  We will support Lebanese authorities' efforts to 
ensure that. 
 
-- The U.S. is fully committed to the Special Tribunal for 
Lebanon. We are confident that the Tribunal will bring to 
justice those responsible for planning and carrying out the 
assassination of former Prime Minister Hariri and so many 
others.  The U.S. has contributed $14 million toward the cost 
of the Tribunal and recently pledged an additional $6 million 
for the second year of its operations, pending Congressional 
approval. 
 
-- We continue our support for the full implementation of 
Security Council Resolutions 1559 and 1701.  Those 
resolutions call for important steps such as the delineation 
of Lebanon's borders and bringing all arms and militias under 
the control of the state. 
 
-- The U.S. fully supports the voices of peace and moderation 
in Lebanon, and want the Lebanese people to know that we 
continue to support their efforts at national reconciliation.
