¶1. (SBU) For the past year, Nicaragua's Liberal factions have 
toyed with the idea of holding internal and/or multi-party 
primaries to select their presidential and National Assembly 
deputy candidates.  Faction leaders generally agree that 
multi-party primaries are the most feasible and democratic 
way to unite the "democratic forces" -- a goal they all 
profess to want.  Nevertheless, attempts to craft a primary 
proposal acceptable to all factions have been received 
without great enthusiasm -- especially on the part of the 
PLC, which has heretofore refused to include deputy 
candidates.  The Liberals and other anti-Sandinista parties 
have come to us directly, or through IRI, to request 
assistance with primaries.  Our response has been clear: we 
are willing provide assistance, but only within certain 
parameters. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Our current proposal for multi-party primaries, 
which we plan to transmit to party leaders immediately after 
the April 2 PLC convention, is a synthesis of various plans 
issued by the Liberal factions and includes the fundamental 
conditions to promote a democratic process and minimize the 
influence of Arnoldo Aleman.  The civil society group 
Movimiento por Nicaragua (MpN) would, with technical 
assistance and a grant of up to $500,000 from IRI, implement 
the proposal under the following conditions: 
 
- All participating parties and alliances will agree in 
advance to the selection, via primaries, of a joint 
presidential candidate and a joint slate of departmental 
deputy candidates. 
 
- Each party or alliance will appoint two representatives to 
serve on a primary oversight committee, which will make 
decisions by consensus.  Meetings will be held in a neutral 
location.  Experts, contracted to organize the process, will 
provide technical assistance. 
 
- The deadline to accept the proposal is April 17.  Keeping 
in mind the Electoral Calendar, the oversight committee will 
decide on which date to hold the primaries. 
 
- Domestic and international observers will be invited to 
monitor and observe the primary process. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: The democratic contenders have failed thus 
far to agree on a joint proposal because none wishes to 
expend time and effort in holding primaries, and party 
leaders would rather grant deputy candidacies to powerful 
supporters than open the positions to competition.  However, 
most do want to achieve the unification of the anti-FSLN 
forces and have pleaded with Emboffs time and again to help 
them achieve this goal.  The pressures of the Electoral 
Calendar (Ref B) demand a final decision and action (or not) 
on primaries -- hence the ultimatum and deadline.  Time is 
running out. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment continued: The probability of PLC acceptance 
of the proposal is low -- Aleman's control of the party would 
be severely undermined if he could no longer name the 
departmental deputy candidates.  Jose Rizo, the front-runner 
for the PLC nomination has, however, supported primaries in 
past statements.  Offering primaries to Rizo may pressure him 
to define himself to the public, who we will then know if he 
is truly independent from Aleman, or merely his puppet.  If 
the PLC's national leaders refuse the democratic path to 
unity offered by the proposal in deference to Aleman, Eduardo 
Montealegre and other dissidents may gain considerable 
leverage to pressure local PLC leaders and supporters to 
finally abandon the party.
