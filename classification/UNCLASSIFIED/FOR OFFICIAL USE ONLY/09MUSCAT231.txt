(SBU) The Charge d'Affaires and Pol-Econ Chief delivered reftel 
points March 17 to Lyutha al-Mughairy, Office Director for Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs Secretary General Sayyid Badr al-Busaidi. 
Al-Mughairy had no substantive response.  On March 24, Omani Minister 
for Foreign Affairs Yusef bin Alawi told the Ambassador that he 
believed the Omani ambassador to the Netherlands would represent Oman 
at the Dutch-hosted international conference on Afghanistan.  The 
following day, March 25, the Dutch ambassador to Muscat told Pol-Econ 
Chief that he had recently received a call from al-Mughairy stating 
that Oman's ambassador in The Hague would attend the conference for 
the Sultanate, but adding that Sayyid Badr, who would be traveling in 
Europe that week, was considering making a quick stop at the event.
