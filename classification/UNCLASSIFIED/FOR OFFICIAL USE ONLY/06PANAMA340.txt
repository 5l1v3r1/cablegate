 SUMMARY 
 ------- 
 
¶1. (U)  Panama is pleased to submit an FY 2006 anti-TIP 
project proposal additional to that contained in reftel B. 
The proposal comes from the Panamanian Attorney General's 
Office (PGR) and asks for $125,000 to purchase computer 
systems, faxes, and digital cameras for the 11 Prosecuting 
Attorneys in Panama responsible for TIP cases.  The GOP would 
use part of the grant for classes and training on the new 
computer systems.  The proposal would also fund instructional 
classes to Panamanian police, judges, social workers, and 
prosecuting attorneys on how to apply Panama's anti-TIP law. 
Although the Government of Panama (GOP) is committed to 
combating TIP, funding for projects is very limited.  Lack of 
modern computer equipment for processing cases and sharing 
information is a problem for Panamanian prosecutors.  Also, 
the PGR needs to provide more TIP training for GOP personnel, 
especially those located in rural areas.  Department funding 
will encourage Panama to continue its anti-TIP efforts.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2.  (U)  The PGR has requested ESF funding for the following 
project: 
 
¶A.  Title of Project:  Computer Modernization and Legal 
Training Program for TIP Prosecuting Attorneys in Panama 
 
¶B.  Name of Recipient Organization: Attorney General of Panama 
 
¶C.  Duration of Project:  12 months 
 
¶D.  Description of Project (including objectives, activities 
and sustainability,) 
 
The overall objective of this project is to assist TIP 
prosecuting attorneys in Panama by purchasing updated 
computer systems and providing training on their use.  The 
second part of this project would provide anti-TIP training 
for GOP officials. 
 
Objectives:  Panama currently has 11 prosecuting attorneys 
for TIP throughout the country.  Many of these offices, 
especially those in rural areas, lack modern office 
equipment. The purchase of two computers with internet 
access, two printers, one fax, and one digital camera for 
each of the 11 prosecutors would allow prosecutors to 
document and process TIP cases quicker.  Faxes and email 
connections provided by internet capable computers would also 
allow information sharing and quicker communications between 
prosecutors and the Attorney General's office.  The GOP will 
also provide training on the use of the new computer 
equipment in the offices that receive it. Digital cameras 
would enable those involved in anti-TIP efforts to share 
photographs of TIP victims and suspects.  Finally, Panama has 
a continuos need to train police, prosecutors, and social 
workers who work with TIP victims and have legal 
responsibility for these cases. 
 
Activities:  Purchase of computer equipment and training on 
its use for prosecuting attorneys. 
 
             Conduct anti-TIP training sessions for GOP 
officials to develop a basic understanding of investigations 
and legal proceedings. 
 
Sustainability:  In 2005, Panama more than doubled its 
arrests for sexual trafficking.  Panama's Attorney General 
has taken the lead on addressing TIP issues.  This project 
will allow Panama's Attorney General to train more government 
officials on TIP and allow these officials to do their jobs 
more efficiently. 
 
¶E.  Justification: Panama is ranked as Tier 2 in the U.S. 
Trafficking in Persons report.  Panama has limited resources 
to conduct anti-TIP operations and training.  Lack of modern 
office equipment for prosecutors is a major problem.  This 
project will allow the PGR to use state of the art equipment 
to conduct investigations in a more efficient manner.  This 
project will also allow Panama to fund much needed training 
for investigators, prosecutors, and social workers who assist 
TIP victims. 
 
 
¶F.  Performance Indicators:  PGR will monitor purchase and 
usage of new computer equipment, faxes and digital cameras 
and schedule users for training.  PGR will also establish 
milestones for the number of persons to be trained. 
 
¶G.  Evaluation Plan:  The Attorney General's office will 
monitor the purchase of equipment and the administration of 
training.  Embassy will meet with PGR every three months to 
verify that the program is going as planned. 
 
¶H. Budget Breakout: 
 
Computer Equipment                  $60,000 
 
Training Seminars/meetings                $65,000 
 
 
Grand total for project             $125,000 
 
¶I.  Type and amount of host government contribution or other 
cost sharing arrangement if any:  PGR will arrange for 
installation and delivery of equipment.  PGR will also 
schedule training events and monitor the numbers of persons 
attending these events. 
 
¶J.  Proposed funding mechanism:  Cooperative agreement
