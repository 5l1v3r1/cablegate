SUBJECT:  Darfur:  Convoy Ambush and Helicopter Incident near Sirba 
 
 
¶1. (U) On December 9 at approximately 1500, armed men ambushed a 
commercial truck near Sirba, 45 kilometers from El Geneina, capital 
of West Darfur State.  UNDSS estimates cite 22 civilians killed, and 
10 wounded by gunmen on horseback armed with RPGs and assault 
rifles. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to UNDSS and AMIS contacts, at 4:40 p.m., the 
Sector Commander sent an AMIS helicopter with three crew, an EU 
Military observer (MILOB), five protection force soldiers, a medic, 
and an interpreter to the site to investigate and medevac 
casualties.  The helicopter landed at 5:00 p.m.; an angry mob 
promptly surrounded it, demanding to know why the AU had not 
protected them and why medevacing casualties took so long.  They 
also demanded that an investigation start immediately.  The 
protesters took the Thuraya satellite phones and weapons of the 
passengers and crew, and prevented the departure of the helicopter. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) The EU MILOB said the mob forced him and the AU 
representatives to the ambush site to investigate and photograph the 
evidence.  They then returned to the police headquarters, where the 
Mil Obs addressed representatives of the protestors, calling for 
calm.  The Sirba police took the passengers and crew to their 
headquarters for protection. 
 
¶4. (SBU) At approximately 12:00 p.m. on December 10, a 
stone-throwing mob attacked the AMIS camp in El Geneina.  Assailants 
fired at least one RPG-7 round into the camp, although it did not 
explode.  PA&E staff took shelter in their safehaven.  The U.S. 
MILOB in El Geneina reports that the Sector Commander was "roughed 
up" by protestors, and that his protection force shot three people, 
killing two.  Police surrounded the camp in an effort to restore 
order. 
 
¶5. (U) AMIS Force Commander Maj. General Luke Aprezi appealed to the 
Sudanese Government to intervene immediately to facilitate the 
release of the personnel and aircraft.  At 5:30 p.m. on December 10 
a Sudanese Armed Forces team arrived, secured the aircraft via MI-24 
helicopters and ground troops; they proceeded to the police station 
to release the detained personnel.  PA&E staff report that the 
helicopter departed and arrived safely in El Geneina at 6:10 p.m.
