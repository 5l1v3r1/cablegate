REF:  A.  DEC 21 GEN MCCHRYSTAL LETTER TO CENTCOM COMMANDER; B: 
STATE 128095; C: ISLAMABAD 3010 
 
¶1.  (SBU) We request all agencies' support to postpone all executive 
branch travel that is not both urgent and strictly necessary, to 
limit the number and duration of visits, and to reduce the size of 
delegations to Afghanistan from January through June 2010.  Our 
request complements and supports the letter issued by COMISAF 
General McChrystal on December 21 
(https://kabulcollaboration.state.gov/ sites/sbu/exec/default.aspx) 
urging that travel to theater be deferred until after June 2010 and 
Islamabad's similar request to limit travel to Pakistan (Reftel C). 
 
¶2. (SBU) We are giving priority to Congressional Delegations, and 
are devoting substantial logistical and human resources to this 
effort. The Embassy faces an unprecedented volume of Executive and 
Congressional visit requests, in particular throughout January and 
early February. We are substantially increasing support resources 
(beds, vehicles, aircraft, etc.) in the coming weeks in order to 
cope with the sharp increase in the size of our permanent mission. 
Meanwhile, we are working all-out to maintain operations in a high 
threat environment (ALDAC Ref B described limited accommodations at 
Post).  Embassy resources are now fully deployed, and continued or 
high volume of visitors will meaningfully impact our ability to 
carry out our core missions. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We ask executive branch visitors' understanding of these 
realities, and agency headquarters' support for our mission by 
rigorously reviewing all prospective travel requests both for 
urgency and necessity.
