Ref: Frazer-Hume E-mail, 13 Dec 06 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The Department has requested information 
regarding the status of Suleiman Jamous, former Humanitarian Affairs 
Coordinator for the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and an 
outspoken opponent of the Darfur Peace Agreement (Ref A).  Jamous is 
currently living at a UN hospital in South Kordofan, and is said to 
be in good condition. His family and supporters have asked the USG 
to allow him to go to the United States for medical treatment, but 
he likely will not qualify for a non-immigrant visa, and the 
Government of Sudan refuses to issue him travel documents.  End 
Summary. 
 
Biographic Information 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Suleiman Adam Jamous was born near Kutum, North Darfur, in 
¶1945.  He attended the Polytechnic University in Khartoum, and 
joined the National Islamic Front (NIF) as a student.  He sided with 
NIF leader Hassan al Turabi in 1999 after President Omar al Bashir 
purged Turabi, and spent four years in prison.  He was released in 
2003, and returned to Darfur, where he joined the SLM/A. 
 
Breaks with Minawi over the Darfur Peace Agreement 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶3. (U) Jamous became the SLM/A's Humanitarian Affairs Coordinator in 
2003, working closely with foreign journalists, international NGOs, 
and UN officials in arranging access to SLA-controlled areas of 
Darfur.  He also served as the SLM/A's liaison to the International 
Criminal Court in 2005.  He has been an outspoken critic of SLM/A 
leader Mini Minawi, calling for reform within the movement. 
 
¶4. (U) Jamous publicly criticized Minawi after the signing of the 
DPA, joining "the Group of 19," a splinter group from Minawi's 
faction that rejected the agreement.  On May 23, 2006, SLM/A Minawi 
forces captured Jamous near Bir Maza and charged him with being a 
spy.  Several human rights activists that had previously worked with 
Jamous spoke out against his detention, and accused Minawi of 
torturing Jamous.  A June 17 op-ed in the New York Times by Julie 
Flint -- titled "Dealing with the Devil in Darfur" -- criticized 
Minawi for arresting Jamous, and called Minawi "the most abusive 
rebel leader in Darfur." 
 
Released after Embassy Intervention 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) CDA Hume met with Minawi on June 19 in El Fasher to discuss 
Minawi's upcoming visit to the White House; on orders from the 
Department, Hume urged Minawi to release Jamous as soon as possible. 
 Three days later, Minawi released Jamous to UNMIS, which secretly 
transferred him to a UNMIS medical facility in Kadugli, South 
Kordofan, for treatment. 
 
¶6. (U) The Government reacted harshly to the UN's move, and accused 
the UN of aiding anti-government rebels.  The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs summoned SRSG Jan Pronk for an explanation, and suspended 
all UN flights to, from, and within Darfur for 48 hours. 
 
Still under UN Protection; Unable to Leave Sudan 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Jamous remains at the UNMIS facility in Kadugli, and is 
said to be in good condition.  UNMIS is unable to move him without 
Government permission, and there are rumors that the Government 
wants to capture him.  His supporters and family -- including his 
daughter and granddaughter, who live in the United States -- have 
campaigned for him to be granted asylum in the United States, and 
have started a petition urging his release.  Given these 
circumstances, Jamous appears unlikely to qualify for a 
non-immigrant visa.  Though he might be eligible for humanitarian 
parole to enter the United States, it is also unlikely that the 
Government of Sudan would issue him a passport or exit visa. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Comment: Given Jamous' public opposition to the DPA and his 
relatively good condition, Post would not be eager to recommend 
Jamous for humanitarian parole at this time.  Moreover, even if 
Jamous were granted parole to enter the United States, gaining the 
Government's permission for him to leave Sudan would require 
considerable diplomatic wrangling.  End Comment.
