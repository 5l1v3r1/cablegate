¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY: The number of H1N1 infections in Germany 
rose by 41 cases to a total of 470 on July 2. Germany's 
airports take different precautions to keep the virus from 
spreading.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On July 2, the National Reference Center for 
Influenza at RKI announced in its press briefing forty-one new 
laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 for Germany.  This 
increases the total number of confirmed virus cases in Germany 
to 470.  New cases were distributed among the federal states 
as follows: North Rhine Westphalia (22), Baden-Wuerttemberg 
(4), Saxony (4), Lower-Saxony (3), Bavaria (3), Schleswig- 
Holstein (2), Hesse (1), Saxony-Anhalt (1) and Mecklenburg- 
Vorpommern (1). 
 
¶3. (SBU)  North Rhine-Westphalia received a spike in cases 
with 22 new confirmed infections and remains the state showing 
the highest number of virus cases among all German states with 
a total of 219, followed by Baden-Wuerttemberg (69) and 
Bavaria (62 cases).  The Federal State of Saarland remains the 
only state without confirmed virus cases.  Over half of all 
confirmed infections in Germany resulted from domestic 
transmission. To date, this number sits at a total of 272. 
 
 
Precautionary Measures at German Airports differ 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Transport Ministry officials confirmed July 2 media 
reports that Germany's airports take different precautions to 
keep the virus from spreading.  Airports in Germany fall under 
the authority of the state, not the federal government. 
State authorities decide on appropriate surveillance 
procedures for each individual airport.  According to the 
media, Duesseldorf airport maintains a high level of 
precautions, while Frankfurt has slightly reduced its 
measures.  In Frankfurt, medical personal will enter an 
airplane only if the cabin crew reports a sick passenger.
