¶1. This is a SET NAJAF cable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY.   In reaction to the terrorist attacks near 
Najaf's Imam Ali Shrine (April 6) and the Attack at Baghdad's 
Buratha mosque (April 7) two of the major Shi'a clerics 
affiliated with Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani issued sharply worded 
Fatwas blaming the United States and Anti-Iraqi forces for 
violence perpetrated against Shi'a.  Ayatollah Mohamed Saeed Al 
Hakeem referred to the attack in Baghdad as evidence of 
attempted genocide.  Ayatollah Bashir Al Najafi said, "The 
occupation brought all these troubles and was the cause, patron 
and attorney to the former regime."  Both men called for the 
quick formation of a national government.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The office of the Ayatollah Mohamed Al Hakeem issued a 
Fatwa on April 8.  The statement condemned "fundamentalists and 
Baathists~for targeting followers of the holy Imams", equating 
acts of violence against Shi'a with genocide.   He went on to 
demand that "the political authorities hurry in forming the 
government."  The Fatwa further demanded solutions to track and 
terminate those who support terrorism.  Finally, the Fatwa 
concluded by offering condolences to the "absent Imam" for the 
suffering that befalls his follower.  Al Hakeem closed with a 
final wish "that the martyrs be raised up to heaven. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In a terse Fatwa,  Ayatollah Al Najafi described the 
situation in Iraq as "sad".  He claimed that it was the 
occupation which brought the problems of "murder, plundering and 
displacement" to Iraq.  The Fatwa asserted that every household 
in Iraq had suffered the effects of the former regime.  "In each 
house," read the statement, "someone (was) killed or missing" 
because of Saddam Hussein.  Iraq's "riches" according to Al 
Najafi had been plundered, especially oil, which was taken 
without proper payment to Iraqis.  Politicians, noted Al Najafi, 
reached their positions on the backs of the people of Iraq, but 
all they care about now is, in fact, their positions. 
 
¶5. (SBU) "They are not true Muslims", said Al Najafi, in 
reference to those who would come to Iraq to kill Iraqis.  The 
statement damned the terrorists to hell and called for them to 
receive "the curse of God".   The Hawza and the people have 
grown tired, Al Najafi asserted.  It is only the agreement of 
politicians in forming the government that can stop the violence 
and the lack of agreement is the work of "ill intentioned" 
politicians, the Fatwa noted.  Sincere politicians are rare, 
according to the Al Najafi.  He closed with a warning for 
politicians who are not working diligently to form a government. 
 "Patience has begun to run out," he said, "and I can not guess 
what tomorrow will bring them". 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT.  The Fatwas of these two Ayatollahs are a 
strong rebuke of violence  targeting Shia.  While the Marja'aya 
have always spoken out against violence, the language is strong. 
 The condemnation of the effort to form a government is 
increasingly a central theme of the Marja'aya's public 
statements.  While Ayatollah Al Sistani himself has yet to issue 
a Fatwa, it would likely mirror these two statements.  Of note 
in Al Najafi and Al Hakeem's statements is the absence of an 
explicit call for peace.  Should Sistani issue a statement as 
stern, it is possible that, without a call for peace, it will 
embolden Shi'a militias.  END COMMENT.
