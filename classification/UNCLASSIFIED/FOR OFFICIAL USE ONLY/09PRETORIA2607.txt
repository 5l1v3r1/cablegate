SUBJECT: DEATH OF FORMER HEALTH MINISTER SHOWS HOW FAR SOUTH AFRICA 
HAS MOVED FROM FORMER AIDS DENIALIST POLICIES 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Former Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang 
died on December 16 from complications arising from a 2007 liver 
transplant surgery.   Having served as  Health Minister from 1999 
until September 2008, Tshabalala-Msimang was the most outspoken 
proponent of the Mbeki government's controversial health policies 
regarding HIV/AIDS.  Many South Africans paid tribute to 
Tsabalala-Msimang as a loyal ANC stalwart, but none have defended 
her performance as spokesperson for the era of AIDS denialism in 
South Africa.  End summary. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) When Tshabalala-Msimang took office in 1999, many in the 
health sector were optimistic because of her work in the National 
Progressive Primary Health Care Network (NPPHCN), her diplomatic 
skills, and strong relationships with pharmaceutical companies.  She 
was also a longstanding ally of new President Thabo Mbeki.  Once in 
office, however, she quickly became embroiled in championing 
President Mbeki's views denying any link between HIV and AIDS, and 
attributing the disease to nutritional deficiencies. 
 
¶3. (SBU) For years Tshabalala-Msimang believed and argued to South 
African citizens that using beetroot, garlic, and African potatoes 
as nutritional supplements would help fight the disease.  She 
repeatedly blocked or delayed distribution of ARV drugs, labeling 
them poisonous and toxic.  (Note: In 2003, she fought and won an 
application in the Constitutional Court to prevent the rollout of 
Nevirapine to pregnant mother for the prevention of mother-to-child 
AIDS transmission.  End Note.) 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Meanwhile, former President Mbeki continues to deny that 
thousands of South Africans died due to the previous government's 
AIDS policy.  Addressing the media following the former Health 
Minister's death, his spokesperson Mukoni Ratshitanga told reporters 
that the previous government did not deny anyone ARV drugs.  He 
reported that anti-retroviral drugs have always been part of the 
public health system and that people had access to them. 
Ratshitanga said the health department, with the guidance of 
Tshabalala-Msimang, followed a "holistic approach" to fight HIV/Aids 
and does not regret its decision.  When asked how Mbeki was taking 
the criticism about the previous government policy on AIDS, 
Ratshitanga reported that "Mbeki is fine with it as he and the late 
former minister never said that HIV does not cause AIDS." 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Comment:  The most interesting aspect surrounding 
Tshabalala-Msimang's death is that, while many spoke of her service 
in the struggle against apartheid, no one, not even Mbeki, attempted 
to defend her advocacy of AIDS denialist policies. In just over a 
year, Tshabalala-Msimang's stance on HIV/AIDS has gone from being 
the prevailing SAG policy to being one that no one is even willing 
to acknowledge publicly.  Mbeki himself is now denying that he was 
ever an "AIDS denialist."  End Comment.
