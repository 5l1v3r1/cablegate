SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO COLOMBIAN OFFER OF ASSISTANCE FOR 
AFGHANISTAN COUNTERNARCOTICS POLICE 
 
REF: BOGOTA 3066 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please pass to NAS/Bogota. 
Please see paragraph three. 
 
¶2. (U) Reftel requested instructions from Department on 
responding to an offer of assistance from the Colombian 
National Police (CNP) to help train the Counternarcotics 
Police of Afghanistan's Narcotics Interdiction Unit (NIU) as 
a continuation of previous INL-sponsored CNP training efforts 
in Afghanistan in 2005-2007. 
 
¶3. (U) The Department continues to review this offer of 
assistance with relevant interagency authorities, and 
requests that Post convey the following message to CNP 
interlocutors: 
 
BEGIN TALKING POINTS: 
 
-     Please accept our sincere appreciation for your offer 
to help train the Government of Afghanistan's Narcotics 
Interdiction Unit. 
 
-     The United States shares Colombia's commitment to 
helping the Government of Afghanistan combat the scourge of 
narcotics in order to provide security to the Afghan people 
and reestablish governance and economic opportunity. 
 
-     As you may be aware, the United States is reviewing its 
counternarcotics strategy in Afghanistan. 
 
-     As we evaluate the current needs of the 
Counternarcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA), we request 
that the Government of Colombia provide additional 
information regarding its intended offer of assistance, 
specifically with regard to the duration and content of the 
instructional curriculum that the Colombian National Police's 
Anti-Narcotics Directorate would intend to provide, as well 
as biographic details regarding suggested officials from the 
Government of Colombia that would provide training to the 
CNPA. 
 
-     At that time, we look forward to reviewing the proposed 
training opportunity suggested by the Government of Colombia 
based on the needs of the CNPA, and in turn, provide a more 
detailed response. 
 
END TALKING POINTS. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Department appreciates Post's attention to these 
requests.
