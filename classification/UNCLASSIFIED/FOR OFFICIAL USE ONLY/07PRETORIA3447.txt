SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA REAFFIRMS ITS INTEREST IN SIGNING THE 
U.S.-SA NUCLEAR R&D AGREEMENT

¶1.  (SBU) Nuclear R&D Agreement: SAG Department of Mines and 
Energy (DME) Chief Director: Nuclear Tseliso Maqubela 
reaffirmed South Africa's intent to sign the proposed 
bilateral Agreement for Cooperation in Research and 
Development in Nuclear Technology, speaking to 
Resource/Energy Officer on the margins of the September 25-26 
Energy Summit (Septel).  Maqubela regretted that the SAG was 
unable to obtain signing authority from the cabinet in 
advance of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
September meeting in Vienna, but he stressed that the SAG 
wanted to pursue bringing the proposed agreement to fruition 
(Ref C).  He noted that the SAG may want to eventually sign 
the agreement in Washington D.C. in order to maintain a lower 
profile in the run up to Eskom's award of a supplier for new 
nuclear power plants, for which Westinghouse and French Areva 
are in contention (Ref A).  Maqubela also said that the SAG 
was interested in pursuing the separate proposal for creating 
a Joint Standing Committee on Nuclear Cooperation, but he was 
unable to give a more detailed response.  (NOTE: Post aims to 
meet soon with Depty Director General Neliswe Magubane, who 
led the April delegation to Washington, where there was 
positive movement on this initiative.  End Note.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU) GNEP: Maqubela said Minister of Energy Buyelwa 
Sonjica did not attend the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership 
(GNEP) Ministerial on September 16 in Vienna, because the SAG 
is not prepared to sign the GNEP Principles given South 
Africa's intent to maintain the option of enriching uranium 
and reprocessing spent fuel as part of its recent draft 
nuclear energy policy (Refs D and E).  He noted that this 
intent also remained an obstacle to accepting the DOE return 
of spent fuel program, for which U.S. law requires commitment 
to forever forego enrichment (Ref B).  Both Maqubela and the 
Minister in her speech at the Summit reaffirmed South 
Africa's commitment to non-proliferation and intent to 
consider enrichment only to low-grade uranium (LEU) as part 
of its policy of pursuing uranium beneficiation and security 
of supply.
