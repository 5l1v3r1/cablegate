¶1.  (U) This cable contains sensitive but unclassified 
information - not for distribution on the Internet. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Summary: Between 2003 and 2008, coalmine deaths in 
Guizhou - one of the poorest provinces in China - fell from 973 
to 453, an industry regulator told Consul General November 3 in 
Guiyang.  The official attributed the improvement to increased 
closures of mines, tougher standards for obtaining mining 
permits, improved structural design in mines, and new rules 
mitigating coalmine gas.  Coalmine accident rates remain 
comparatively high in Guizhou versus the rest of China; China's 
passive, government-controlled labor unions have not been a 
vocal force for safety improvements.  The official requested 
renewed cooperation with the United States on mine safety.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
 
Mine Safety: Guizhou's Recent Efforts 
 
------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In order to better understand labor rights and 
conditions in the Guizhou mining sector, Consul General met on 
November 3 with Chen Fuqing, Vice Director of the Guizhou 
Administration for Work Safety (GAWS).  GAWS was established in 
2000, and employs about 60 staff working in 5 sub-bureaus in 9 
cities and prefectures. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The mining sector is a vital component of the Guizhou 
economy, ranking fifth among Chinese provinces in coal output. 
Chen informed CG that small mining operations account for about 
70 percent of coal output, and that 90 percent of all mines in 
Guizhou are privately operated.  To date, there is no foreign 
direct investment in Guizhou coalmines. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Mining safety issues remain problematic throughout 
China, where unsafe working conditions and poor worker rights 
often lead to deadly accidents.  In 2008, China averaged about 
1.2 fatalities per million metric tons of coal produced, 
according to an official from the National Energy Bureau.  Chen 
asserted that mine safety is especially problematic in Guizhou 
compared to other Chinese provinces and foreign countries.  He 
informed CG that in 2008 Guizhou averaged 3.84 fatalities per 
million metric tons of coal.  Despite this comparatively high 
rate, it represents a significant decrease from the 2000 Guizhou 
rate of 21.3 fatalities per million metric tons of coal.  (Note: 
 By comparison, the U.S. in 2008 had only 0.028 deaths per 
million metric tons of coal, according to data from the Mine 
Safety and Health Administration. End Note.) 
 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Chen attributed Guizhou's improved safety record to 
four factors: 
 
 
 
a. Mine Closures: 
 
 
 
At its peak, Guizhou had over 10,000 coalmines but today this 
number is only about 1,800.  GAWS closes about 10 coalmines per 
year based on complaints from ordinary citizens.  CG asked about 
the role of labor unions in mine safety.  Chen responded all 
mines have them but that they "work differently in China than in 
the U.S."  (Comment: Chinese labor unions are subordinate to the 
Communist Party, are not independent of management, and lack the 
power to strike.  Chen's vague response was his safe way of 
signaling that labor unions do not play a vocal role in mine 
safety issues.  This being said, we have to imagine that the 
anger of families of victims of mine accidents has added 
pressure to the government to improve worker safety.  End 
Comment.)

b. Tougher Standards on Mining Permits 
 
 
 
Chen stated that before 2000, obtaining a mining permit was very 
easy, only requiring permission from the county government.  New 
rules now require permit-seekers to obtain approval from the 
Provincial Administration of Work Safety, and the Environmental 
Protection Department. 
 
 
 
c. Improved Coalmine Structural Standards: 
 
 
 
New regulations require coalmines to build iron and steel 
frameworks before they start coal production.  This is strictly 
enforced on all coalmines.  If mining companies are found to be 
non-compliant, they will be fined, required to participate in 
safety training, or closed in more serious cases.  These 
measures have especially helped to reduce the number of 
accidents caused by roof cave-ins. 
 
 
 
d. New Rules Reducing Mine Gas: 
 
 
 
Mine gas, composed primarily of methane, is a natural byproduct 
of the geochemical reactions that produce coal.  Mining activity 
releases trapped mine gas and when mixed with air it can produce 
deadly explosions.  New regulations require mine gas to be 
pumped out before mining activity can begin.  In 2008, about 600 
million cubic meters of coal gas was pumped out of mines 
throughout Guizhou, compared with only 100 million cubic meters 
in 2007.  In 2005, mine gas explosions caused 86 accidents 
leading to 312 deaths, while in 2008 these numbers fell to 21 
accidents and 69 deaths.  This reflects a drop in the proportion 
of accidents caused by mine gas from over 50 percent in 2003 to 
less than 20 percent in 2008. 
 
 
 
Cooperation with the United States 
 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Chen highlighted recent cooperation between GAWS and 
the United States through training programs and requested 
increased exchanges.  The first example was a management and 
technology-focused training program held in West Virginia in 
1994, which led Guizhou officials to streamline operations by 
reducing employees at one large mine from 30,000 to 10,000 while 
increasing total output.  The second example was the current 
coalmine safety program used throughout China, which researchers 
from West Virginia University proposed to former Chinese Premier 
Zhu Rongji.  Acting on these recommendations, Zhu Rongji helped 
create the State Administration for Work Safety.
