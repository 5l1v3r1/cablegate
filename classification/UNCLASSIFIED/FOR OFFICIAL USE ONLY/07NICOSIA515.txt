Poloff June 12 delivered reftel points to MFA Near East 
Affairs Attache Dionysis Dionysiou.  Dionysiou responded June 
13 that the MFA's Department of Development Cooperation and 
Humanitarian Aid (CyprusAid) would likely target its annual 
voluntary contribution to UNRWA (15,000 CYP, approx USD 
34,500) to aid Palestinian refugees displaced in Lebanon. 
The MFA favored upping the donation to 30,000 CYP, he 
revealed, and has sought approval from the ROC's Council of 
Ministers for the increase.  Dionysiou added that CyprusAid 
was also considering two other projects in Lebanon, including 
one to improve sewage systems there.
