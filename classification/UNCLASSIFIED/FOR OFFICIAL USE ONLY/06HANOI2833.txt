¶1. (SBU) On November 8, Poloff discussed reftel points on the Cuba 
embargo resolution and the Australian amendment with MFA 
International Organizations Department Deputy Director Vu Anh Quang. 
 Mr. Quang said the GVN position is consistent with the majority of 
countries that support the Cuba embargo resolution.  He added that 
the Australian proposal was new information and that he did not have 
a definitive decision yet.  He needs to study it more carefully and 
make a report to MFA leadership. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mr. Quang then offered his personal view that the UN is not 
a tribune or forum for countries to exert pressure in the area of 
human rights.  Rather, the GVN supports dialogue and cooperation in 
order to resolve different views concerning human rights and 
democracy issues.
