(SBU) On July 5, we delivered reftel points to Tonu 
Miller, Acting MFA Director for Security and Arms 
Control, and Kristjan Prikk, MFA Security and Arms 
Control Desk Officer, and requested the GOE donate 
surplus ammunition to the Government of Lebanon (GOL). 
Given the Estonian Defense Force's limited stock of the 
specific ammunition requested and ongoing demands from 
Estonia's own military operations in Afghanistan and 
Iraq, Prikk said that it was highly unlikely that 
Estonia could donate any surplus ammunition to the GOL 
in the 10-15 day timeframe requested.
