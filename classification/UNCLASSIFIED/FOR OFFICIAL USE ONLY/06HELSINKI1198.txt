SUBJECT: EU DECISION ON AVIATION EMISSIONS TRADING SET FOR 
GERMAN EU PRESIDENCY 
 
REF: SECSTATE 190254 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on the EU,s 
proposal to include international emissions from non-EU air 
carriers in its Emission Trading Scheme to Anna 
Wickstrom-Noejgaard and Anu Pulkkinen, both from the North 
America Unit of the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 
Contacts were unwilling to take a position on the substance 
of the demarche until the European Commission issues its 
findings on December 20.  Given the late timing of the 
Commission,s findings, contacts noted this issue will roll 
over to the German EU Presidency.  GOF officials have been 
publicly supportive of including air travel in Europe in 
emissions trading, going so far as making donations to 
climate change mitigation projects to compensate for the CO2 
emissions from air travel to and from EU meetings.  However, 
GOF officials have fallen short of commenting on whether 
non-European air carriers would be included.
