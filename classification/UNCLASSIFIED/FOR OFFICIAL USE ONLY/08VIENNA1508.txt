SUBJECT: AUSTRIAN VIEWS IN ADVANCE OF THE OCTOBER 13 GAERC 
 
REF: STATE 108064 
 
(SBU) Polchief discussed reftel points October 8 with Klaus 
Famira, MFA European correspondent.  Famira provided the 
following information on the October 13 GAERC agenda: 
 
-- Georgia: EU representatives will discuss the deployment of 
the EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM).  Famira acknowledged that 
EU leaders are concerned that Russia has not allowed EUMM 
access to Abkhazia or South Ossetia.  He said the French may 
press Russian President Medvedev on this issue at the 
November EU-Russia Summit.  Famira said the GOA would likely 
not provide any new bilateral assistance for Georgia, though 
this was still under consideration. 
 
-- Zimbabwe: Discussion of Zimbabwe will probably be very 
brief.  Participants may discuss how the change of leadership 
in South Africa influences the political dynamics. 
 
-- Belarus: Famira said the "balanced view" on Belarus 
reflected in reftel points is very close to the EU position. 
The OHDIR report on the elections paints a "grim picture." 
At the same time, however, the Government of Belarus allowed 
OHDIR to observe the elections, permitted opposition 
candidates to register, and released political prisoners. 
President Lukashenka is looking to move closer to the West to 
offset his ties to Moscow.  Famira said GAERC participants 
are not expected to reach any decisions on sanctions.  He 
said EU leaders are not considering changing the legal 
framework regarding Belarus, but rather discussing ways of 
making gestures to encourage a more Western orientation. 
 
-- Uzbekistan: The GOA could support a measure to lift the 
visa ban against Uzbek officials, but would insist that the 
arms embargo remain intact. 
 
-- Informal Oct. 30 GAERC: Famira said the French may discuss 
plans for an informal GAERC to be held October 30 in Paris to 
discuss transatlantic relations, following up on the 
discussion at the September 5-6 Gymnich.  He said the GOA is 
not sure why the French want to continue with this project. 
The EU-U.S. relationship is sound, and is far closer and more 
extensive than any other EU relationship.  Austrian officials 
do not see the value in holding another discussion that would 
focus on only a few of the many areas of transatlantic 
cooperation, and might choose not to attend, he said.
