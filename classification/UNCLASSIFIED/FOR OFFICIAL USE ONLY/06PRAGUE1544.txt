(SBU) Deputy Director of the MFA Security Policy Department 
Daniel Kostoval, replying to ref A, told Poloff on December 
20 that the Czechs will not extend the participation of Czech 
police trainers at the Jordan International Police Training 
Center (JIPTC). Kostoval attributed the decision to budgetary 
limitations, in light of the Czechs on-going support for 
Iraqi stabilization and development (ref B), and the efforts 
to provide assistance to Lebanon (ref C).
