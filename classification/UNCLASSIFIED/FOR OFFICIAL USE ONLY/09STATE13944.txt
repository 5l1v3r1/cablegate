SUBJECT: ECUADOR: MANTA FORWARD OPERATING LOCATION 
WITHDRAWAL TIMELINE 
 
REF: QUITO 33 
 
¶1. (U) The following points respond to Embassy Quito's 
request (reftel) for a timeline for the withdrawal from the 
Manta Forward Operating Location, as well as other 
information.  Post may share these points with GOE 
counterparts. 
 
¶2. (U) TALKING POINTS: MANTA FOL WITHDRAWAL 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
-- The U.S. Air Force has recommended to the U.S. Department 
of Defense ending FOL activities on 30 September, 2009. 
 
-- USAF has therefore recommended ending flight operations on 
17 July, 2009, to permit time to conclude all FOL activities 
by 30 September. 
 
-- When U.S. air operations cease, associated U.S.-provided 
services (e.g. air traffic control liaison, bird aircraft 
strike hazard (BASH) programs, and crash/fire rescue) will 
also end. 
 
-- DOD will provide specifics on what equipment might be 
declared excess to DOD requirements by April 2009. 
 
-- U.S. laws, DOD regulations and ongoing DOD operational 
requirements will, however, necessitate removing lifesaving 
equipment (e.g. fire suppression, ambulance services) 
communications and security systems (e.g. cameras.) 
 
-- Equipment which is installed as part of a "facility" under 
the terms of the FOL Agreement will remain installed and thus 
transfer to Ecuadorian control, unless there is a specific 
DOD requirement for use of such equipment elsewhere. 
 
-- These dates are subject to change if circumstances 
require, but represent the best estimated timeline currently 
available. 
 
-- We request that you coordinate with the Embassy MilGroup 
Commander and the FOL Commander on what kinds of training 
might be needed regarding any equipment which may be 
transferred from U.S. to Ecuadorian control at the end of FOL 
operations.  FOL personnel on site will do their best to 
provide training on basic equipment operation, as long as 
such training does not interfere with ongoing operations or 
actions required as part of the withdrawal.  DOD cannot, 
however, provide advanced or specialized training nor 
training that may be required from private manufacturers, 
contractors or service providers. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Additional Background for U.S. Embassy and FOL 
Personnel 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
-- USAF recommendations regarding disposition of uninstalled 
equipment at FOL Manta are due to DOD mid-March 2009.  The 
recommendations will outline equipment needed to meet DOD 
requirements outside Ecuador and excess equipment which may 
be transferred to Ecuadorian ownership. 
 
-- DOD plans for FOL facilities and real property to be 
turned over to the Ecuadorian Air Force in "working order" at 
transfer.  This means the facilities and installed equipment 
to be transferred will work as intended, but it does not mean 
that DOD will necessarily transfer all non-installed 
equipment which may be needed to operate the facility if such 
non-installed equipment is required for DOD operations 
outside Ecuador. 
 
-- U.S. law and regulations require certain categories of 
equipment to be removed, including lifesaving (e.g. 
 
STATE 00013944  002 OF 002 
 
 
firefighting) communications and security systems (e.g. 
cameras.)  Such equipment is required for ongoing DOD 
operations. 
 
-- Items at the FOL identified by DOD as excess to its 
requirements can be made available to the U.S. Embassy 
MilGroup for transfer to Ecuadorians.  USAF will make 
recommendations to DOD on what equipment and property it 
considers to be excess, but final decisions will be 
coordinated by DOD.  Preliminary recommendations must 
therefore be held exclusively within the USG until decisions 
are final. 
 
-- According to U.S. law, any items declared to be excess 
will be treated "as is/where is," meaning that DOD will not 
pay to transport, store, maintain or recondition the 
equipment nor incur any other costs potentially associated 
with its transfer. 
 
-- DOD has no objection to using DOD CN funds to provide 
limited training for Ecuadorian personnel to operate 
equipment to be transferred at the end of the FOL Agreement. 
The FOL Commander should make recommendations through 
existing USAF channels to DOD for decision regarding the 
extent of such training and estimated costs, if any.  The DOD 
CN program will not, however, assume any responsibility for 
training, maintenance, safety certifications or any other 
activities associated with transfer of the FOL past the end 
of the FOL Agreement period. 
 
-- DOD has no objection to the FOL Commander -- without need 
for further authorization -- granting access to Ecuadorian 
personnel at his discretion to view any FOL facilities (or 
blueprints, diagrams, etc.) as part of coordination and 
preparation for transfer of facilities under the terms of the 
existing FOL Agreement.  Any actual request by Ecuadorian 
personnel to utilize such facilities before 30 September 
2009, on the other hand, should be referred to DOD for 
decision along with the FOL Commander's evaluation on whether 
granting such a request in part or in whole may risk impeding 
ongoing operations or the U.S. withdrawal. 
 
-- DOD has no objection to the GOE request that the U.S. 
Embassy and/or the FOL Commander provide information 
regarding community outreach or similar activities conducted 
by FOL personnel, at the discretion and best judgment of the 
FOL Commander without need for further authorization. 
 
-- As the drawdown proceeds in the months ahead, DOD and 
State understand and agree that the Ambassador and U.S. 
Embassy in Quito will continue to coordinate directly with 
the FOL regarding issues as they arise, while FOL personnel 
will continue to operate under the established military chain 
of command.
