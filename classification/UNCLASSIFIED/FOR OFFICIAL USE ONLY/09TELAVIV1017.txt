     ¶B. STATE 4099 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Per reftels, the GOI will likely postpone its 
proposed Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism 
(GICNT) expert-level workshop tentatively scheduled for 
November 2009.  According to MFA Arms Control Advisor Israel 
Tikochinski, the GOI was not aware of competing GICNT events 
also scheduled for November 2009, including specifically an 
exercise hosted by the Dutch and an Exercise Planning Group 
hosted by the Hungarians.  Tikochinski said the GOI 
appreciated Washington's interest in the GOI's workshop 
proposal focusing on legal aspects and forensics issues 
related to combating nuclear and radiological terrorism.  He 
noted that the MFA will need to consult with the Israel 
Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) and other GOI interagency 
stakeholders to determine whether February 2010 is a suitable 
alternative to host the workshop.  If not then, Tikochinski 
said the GOI will work with Washington to determine an 
appropriate time frame.  Tikochinski discussed these issues 
with polmiloff on May 6.
