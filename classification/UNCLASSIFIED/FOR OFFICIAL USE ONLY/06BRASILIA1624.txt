¶1.  Summary.  (U) In a mid-July three-day visit to Brazil, USTDA 
Director Thelma Askey met with government leaders, industry 
officials and businessmen in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and 
Brasilia.  In addition, Ms. Askey signed four grants, totaling 
nearly US$2 million, in support of priority Brazilian development 
projects using private sector expertise and technology.  These grant 
agreements cover such diverse areas as technical assistance on 
emergency preparedness, water treatment, occupational health, and 
cargo handling.  In addition to the grant agreements, USTDA and 
Brazil's National Development Bank (BNDES) signed a memorandum of 
understanding committing the two agencies to working together. 
Finally, USTDA formally entered in a public-private partnership with 
AmCham Sao Paulo to support a training seminar on IPR protection for 
the state's IPR enforcement officers.  All these activities help 
further the goal expressed by the President during his November 2005 
meeting with President Lula to increase bilateral trade. 
Specifically, USTDA efforts will be key in implementing the 
Commercial Dialogue initiated by Secretary Gutierrez and Minister of 
Development, Industry, and Commerce Furlan in June 2006.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  During the course of her July 20 stay in Brasilia, Ms. 
Askey met with both local AmCham officials and Minister of 
Transportation Paulo Sergio Passos and his aides.  At the latter 
meeting, Askey was accompanied by USTDA Policy/Program Director 
Geoffrey Jackson, USTDA Brazil Country Officer Anne McKinney, post's 
Deputy Senior Commercial Office and Charge.  Passos opened the 
session by noting that his Ministry was working feverishly to 
improve Brazil's lagging port, road, and railroad infrastructure. 
The Ministry was in the process of putting together a national 
transport and logistics plan, focused on the principal lines of 
action in the short, medium, and long-term (i.e., out to the year 
2023).  The plan was to be completed in December 2006, and was 
designed to serve as a guide for the next president - whether that 
be a reelected Lula administration or an opposition government. 
(Note:  This is not unusual.  Under the GOB's 4-year planning cycle, 
each presidential administration is responsible for establishing 
goals/objectives for the last three years of its term plus the first 
year of the next government.) 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Passos stated that his Ministry was looking at how to move 
forward several priority projects, inter alia, expansion of the Port 
of Santos.  The largest port in Latin America, with a capacity of 72 
million tons a year, Santos was to be upgraded to an eventual 
capacity of 120 million tons a year through a three-phase 
construction program.  Other key projects included expansion of the 
port of Itaqui in Northeastern Brazil, which currently mainly 
handles mining exports, so that it could also be used as a conduit 
for soybeans.  In addition, the deep-water port of Sepetiba, near 
Rio de Janeiro, could be turned into a hub port if loading 
facilities, road access and railroad access were improved.  Instead 
of handling principally minerals, as it does now, it could become 
one of the largest export platforms in Brazil, Passos declared. 
Finally, Passos said that the Ministry was considering how best to 
up grade the rail network in the western interior of Bahia state and 
that it would need a feasibility study done to consider its options. 
 The Bahia rail project, he added, eventually could become one of 
the GOB's public-private partnership programs. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Askey and Jackson outlined for their Brazilian 
interlocutors USTDA's expertise in infrastructure issues and noted 
that the agency had done much work in the past related to trade 
capacity (i.e., tracking cargo containers, streamlining customs 
clearance, etc).  Passos expressed interest in USTDA's services and 
stated that this staff would be in touch with that agency's experts. 
 Other possible areas for GOB-USTDA cooperation, he continued, could 
include the dredging of ports, improvement of the country's road 
network, and assistance with environmental studies. 
 
¶5.  (U)  Post stands ready to assist in the full range of USTDA 
activities in Brazil.
