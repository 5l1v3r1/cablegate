(SBU) Pol/Econ Chief June 17 delivered reftel demarche 
concerning demanding accountability from WIPO Director 
General Idris to MFA Director for Bilateral Affairs Dhafer Al 
Umran.  Al Umran pledged to forward the information to the 
Bahraini mission in Geneva so it was fully briefed on the 
issue prior to the WIPO Program and Budget Committee meeting 
June 25-28.  He lamented what Idris had done, saying Idris 
should be protecting his organization, not taking advantage 
of it.
