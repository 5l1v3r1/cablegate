(SBU)  CDA delivered reftel demarche January 13 to MFA Under 
Secretary Abdulaziz bin Mubarak Al Khalifa.  Shaikh Abdulaziz 
listened with interest, and concluded the U.S. and Bahrain

important interest in protecting the reputation of its 
financial sector, which accounts for 25 to 30 percent of GDP.
