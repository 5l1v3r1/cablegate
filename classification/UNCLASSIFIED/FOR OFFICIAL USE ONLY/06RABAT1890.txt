SOME COMMENTS 
 
REF: RABAT 1713 
 
¶1.  (U) This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please 
protect accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on October 6, 
Ambassador Riley thanked Minister Delegate Taieb Fassi Fihri 
for agreeing to host the Initial Partner Nations (IPNs) 
meeting on October 30-31 of the Global Initiative to Combat 
Nuclear Terrorism (GI).  Fassi Fihri told the Ambassador he 
looked forward to the initial meeting.  Fassi Fihri concurred 
with the scenario whereby Morocco would become the first 
country to join the GI after the IPNs, endorsing the 
Statement of Principles and pledging to adhere to them at the 
end of the first day of meetings.  Although accepting, Fassi 
Fihri appeared a bit uncomfortable that for Morocco to join 
the GI it would have to endorse text that it had no role 
negotiating.  Fassi Fihri explained that Morocco would be 
interested in the idea of obtaining an intermediary observer 
status, similar to the status the IAEA will be accorded for 
the meeting. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Fassi Fihri recalled that Morocco was a 
participating state in the Proliferation Security Initiative 
(PSI) and now sits on the IAEA Board of Governors.  In this 
spirit, and while recognizing that the initiative was already 
far along, he took the occasion to offer a few comments on 
the Statement of Principles and other GI documents.  He was 
concerned that the IPNs were "a club" of only the rich and 
powerful.  There was no important country from the 
South/Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), not even nuclear powers 
like India, or weapons-free states like South Africa or 
Brazil.  He had heard from NAM members that they did not 
appreciate initiatives taken outside multilateral channels. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Fassi Fihri also believed that while looking at 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) responsibilities, the 
GI and its documents should take more account of the NPT 
rights of the South/NAM, including access to peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy.  He added that it may be possible to add 
language on the South/NAM to the Statement of Principles or 
mention its role in a separate statement.  Fassi Fihri 
explained that countries have the right to acquire peaceful 
nuclear energy, but thaQthis right should be clearly 
exercised with recognition of the threat of terrorism.
