¶1.  (SBU) In further response to Ref A points (and post's interim 
Ref B response), MFA has passed us a written response from the 
Ministry of Health. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The GOT agrees that all countries should cooperate in 
sharing influenza virus samples with the Global Influenza Monitoring 
Network under WHO.  Also, given that influenza is a global problem, 
a fair and just structure under WTO supervision should be 
established for meeting vaccine and other logistical needs. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Smallpox vaccines should be stocked by countries to 
respond to a possible biological threat or for use at times of 
emergency.  It would be appropriate for certain countries to keep 
smallpox viruses for research, again under WHO supervision. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Post will endeavor to get additional information from the 
Health Ministry, including questions in Ref C on sample sharing and 
vaccine access, but many key health officials may be attending the 
WHA.
