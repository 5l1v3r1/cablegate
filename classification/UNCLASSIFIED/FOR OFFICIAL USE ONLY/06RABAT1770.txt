protect accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On September 22, Poloff informed the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA) that the United States and Russia 
agreed to its preference (ref A) to hold the first Global 
Initiative meeting in Morocco on October 30-31.  MFA 
Multilateral Affairs officer Azzeddin Farhane welcomed the 
change of dates, and expressed his appreciation that the GOM 
concerns expressed in ref B had been taken into 
consideration.  Farhane added that the letters of invitation, 
with new confirmed dates, would be routed to the minister for 
approval as soon as possible.  Regarding the possible 
location of the meeting, Farhane shared that the event will 
most likely be held in Rabat.  He pledged to inform the 
embassy when the decision is final. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Farhane repeated the GOM's request for further 
guidance on logistical matters and budget issues, asking in 
particular if the United States and Russia would provide 
assistance with funding. Embassy would welcome advise on any 
additional information we can provide in response.
