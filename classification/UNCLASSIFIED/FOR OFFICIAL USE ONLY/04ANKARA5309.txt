SUBJECT: PROPOSED MEMORANDUM OF INTENT BETWEEN DOE AND

REF: SECSTATE 198338 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per Reftel request, Post passed proposed Statement 
Of Intent to the Government of Turkey Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs by both fax and diplomatic note.  Post confirmed that 
MFA forwarded copies to both the Ministry of Energy and the 
Turkish Atomic Energy Commission. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Basak Tug, MFA First Secretary and Energy contact, 
confirmed to EconOff on September 16 that all three agencies 
were reviewing the proposed text in parallel.  She was aware 
of the high level demarche by DOE to the Turkish Ambassador 
in Washington.  Ms Tug said she would do her best to expedite 
processing, but was pessimistic about achieving the proposed 
september 21 signing of the proposed Statement of Intent. 
She stated that if the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and 
Energy approved the content, authorization for signing on 
behalf of the Government of Turkey would have to come from 
the Prime Minister's Office and the Council of Ministers. 
This process usually takes weeks rather than days.  Ms. Tug 
assured EconOff that the document was in the pipeline and 
they would do their best to facilitate processing.
