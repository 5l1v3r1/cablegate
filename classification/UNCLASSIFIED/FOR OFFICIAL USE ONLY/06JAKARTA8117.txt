REF: JAKARTA 7909 (PROSECUTION DOSSIERS COMPLETED) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Legatt, poloff, and conoff met June 28 with Abdul 
Hakim Ritonga, Acting Deputy Attorney General for General 
Crimes, who advised us that the trial of Anthonious Wamang 
and his co-conspirators would begin on July 4 in Central 
Jakarta District Court.  Wamang faces charges including 
premeditated murder in connection with the August 31, 2002 
murders of two U.S. citizens and one Indonesian near Timika, 
Papua.  The Jakarta Central Court has named Ms. Andriani 
Nurdin as chief judge in the case.  Other members of the 3-5 
judge panel have yet to be designated.  The initial session 
will be devoted to identifying the defendants.  The cases 
would then be adjourned to another day.  The following 
session would be for the reading of the charges, which can 
take several hours.  The defendant will be given a chance to 
answer the charges before the prosecution calls witnesses, 
according to Ritonga.  Normally the defense reply is reserved 
for a separate session.  It will likely be a matter of weeks 
before the testimony of U.S. witnesses is required, and 
Ritonga said that we would be given adequate advance notice 
to make arrangements.  We stressed that we require two weeks 
as a minimum.  Participation by U.S. witnesses will not be 
required for several weeks. 
 
¶2. (SBU) As discussed reftel, the case will be handled in two 
concurrently-held trials, although the same panel of judges 
and team of prosecutors serve in both cases.  Wamang is faced 
with charges including premeditated murder; his six 
co-conspirators will be tried separately on lesser charges. 
Ms. Anita Asterida will coordinate the prosecution of Wamang, 
while Fernando Siagian will lead the prosecution of the 
co-conspirators. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ritonga said that it is customary for trial sessions 
to be held once a week, usually on Tuesday.  It is still 
undecided whether the court will hear two sessions on trial 
days - one for each set of defendants - or try the two groups 
on different days of the week.  Ritonga reaffirmed that the 
prosecution and the judge will work to make any special 
arrangements to accommodate U.S. victim and expert witnesses, 
such as hold sessions more frequently than once a week during 
the time they will be providing testimony.
