SUBJECT: PERU RESPONSE TO ZIMBABWE UNCSD DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 58046 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Econoff delivered the reftel request for GOP 
support in opposing Zimbabwe's candidacy for chairmanship of 
the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) to the MFA 
UN Bureau's Director for Candidacies and Quotas Oswaldo del 
Aguila on May 4.  Del Aguila responded that, in principle, 
the GOP respected the prerogative of regional groups to 
select their candidates, but expressed hope that a compromise 
could be found to avoid a Zimbabwe chairmanship.  He said 
Peru had brought the issue to GRULAC, and that GRULAC was 
working to find a solution.  Del Aguila did not have any 
details on possible solutions, saying those discussions were 
occurring among UN missions. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Del Aguila said that Germany first approached 
Peru's Mission to the UN on this issue, and that other 
embassies in Peru had also requested Peru's help.  While 
Econoff was at the MFA, a Canadian diplomat arrived to 
deliver the same demarche.
