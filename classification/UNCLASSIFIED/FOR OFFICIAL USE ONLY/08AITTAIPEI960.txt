Bureau of the Organic Laws and States, Legislative Yuan (LY), plans 
to review the Transfer of Intangible Technology legislation proposed 
by the National Science Council (NSC), the Executive Yuan (EY), 
according to an NSC official. With the new administration in place,

¶1.  (SBU) On May 16, the EXBS Advisor made a courtesy call to the 
Deputy Director of Keelung Customs and the Chief of the Keelung 
Harbor Police.  Both organizations actively participate in EXBS 
programs. 
 
During the visit, Keelung Customs gave a comprehensive presentation 
on its operations, specifically as they related to controls of 
Strategic Hi-Tech Commodities (SHTC):  Since 1992, Keeling Customs 
has been using an automated cargo clearance system; the average 
export cargo clearance processing time is 0.20 hours for sea cargo 
and 0.14 hours for air cargo; 80.45% of sea cargo and 91.43% of air 
cargo is cleared without physical examination.  In 2007, Keelung 
Customs intercepted 105 of the 429 SHTC suspect shipments found by 
Taiwan Customs.  Lastly, Keelung Customs demonstrated an on-site 
containerized cargo examination for the Advisor.  After the cargo 
examination, the Harbor Police provided a tour of the port in a 
patrol boat to further explain its operations on the water. 
 
Both Keelung Customs and Harbor Police expressed gratitude for the 
opportunities provided by EXBS and are looking forward to 
participating in future programs.

the Keelung Harbor Bureau.  The Keelung Harbor Bureau regularly

briefing of the harbor management, function and services. The Port 
of Keelung encompasses approximately 5.72 square kilometers in water 
area. Port facilities are capable of accommodating Post-Panamax (a 
class of container ship with a cargo capacity exceeding 10,000 TEU) 
container vessels and bulk cargo vessels up to 60,000 tonnage.  The 
port operates with 57 wharves and has over 9,000 meters in total 
length and one main channel with a depth of 15.5 meters.  The port 
was originally founded in 1945. Keelung Harbor serves the Greater
