¶1.  (U) Poloff met with Charles Ononye, Deputy Director of 
the Nigerian MFA's International Organizations Division, on 
November 27 to deliver reftel demarche.  Ononye promised to 
consider the U.S. reasons for opposing the three resolutions 
and confer with his colleagues in New York, but he was 
ultimately noncommittal on how Nigeria might vote.  He said 
Nigeria supports the two-state solution for Middle East peace 
and the GON will make a "balanced" statement on November 29 
to mark the UN's "International Day of Solidarity with the 
Palestinian People." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ononye also recommended that the Government of 
Israel approach both the Africa Group and the Non-Aligned 
Movement to seek support on these and other UN votes. 
According to Ononye, "Israel has friends in Nigeria and in 
Africa, but she needs to engage them both at the UN and in 
capitals."  He believes that Israel may be able to sway the 
votes of 2-3 African countries in the short term and work 
with them over time to build greater support within the 
Africa Group.
