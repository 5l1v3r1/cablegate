REQUEST FOR EXTRAORDINARY NRC MEETING 
 
¶1. (SBU) On Monday, August 18, the Permanent Representative 
of the Russian Federation to NATO, Ambassador Dmitry Rogozin, 
circulated a letter to the Deputy Secretary General and 
distributed to all delegations rescinding his request for an 
extraordinary meeting of the NATO-Russia Council (NRC).  The 
text of the letter follows. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Brussels, "18" August, 2008 
 
Dear Mr. Deputy Secretary General, 
 
In view of continuing uncertainty regarding our request to 
convene the NRC extraordinary meeting on events in and around 
South Ossetia I revoke this application as irrelevant under 
the present circumstances.  Making our request we proceeded 
from a clear understanding that extraordinary meetings of the 
NRC provided for in the Organizational arrangements are 
needed to exchange opinions on topical issues in the 
framework of Russia-NATO political dialogue and have to be 
treated as a matter of urgency by all NRC member states.  It 
is of particular importance at a time when our positions 
significantly differ. 
 
Please, distribute this letter to all NRC delegations. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
 
/s/ 
 
¶D. ROGOZIN
