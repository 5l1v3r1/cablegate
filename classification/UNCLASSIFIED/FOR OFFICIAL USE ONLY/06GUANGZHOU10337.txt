¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Continuing its efforts to get 
especially its Entry Level Officers (ELOs) on full two-year 
consular tours out of the office and onto the roads, 
cities, and villages of south China to do policy advocacy 
and public diplomacy work, Consulate Guangzhou embarked on 
its "short march" to eastern Guangdong, particularly the 
so-called Chao-Shan area centering on ancient, faded but 
gradually reviving Chaozhou and upstart, pushy, and bumpily 
and swervingly developing Shantou.  Shantou especially is 
the "heart of the heart of darkness" of intellectual 
property rights (IPR) malfeasance, and some of the trip's 
emphasis was on reviewing the role of local Market Order 
Rectification Offices (MOROs) in IPR enforcement and on 
using university presentations to tie together the themes 
of respect for IPR and the innovative society that students 
profess to want to build in south China.  End Summary. 
 
"Journey to the West" Concept Heads East 
---------------------------------------- 
¶2.  (SBU) In line with the same operational and management 
philosophy behind Consulate Guangzhou's January 2006 
"Journey to the West" to Guangxi (reftels), we embarked in 
the second week of March on the "short march" to eastern 
Guangdong by Consulate van.  On the "march," the Consulate 
party rotated in and out three ELOs, two of whom are on 
full two-year consular tours.  As with the "Journey to the 
West," the ELO leadership development aim is to provide 
opportunities for the consular ELOs to get literally 
ground's eye and face-to-face views of places and people of 
the consular district to improve the officers' visa 
adjudication capabilities, provide them policy advocacy and 
public speaking opportunities, and to allow for direct 
mentoring from the Consul General and the 
Economic/Political Section chief on interviewing and 
interaction techniques, policy advocacy, and public 
speaking presence. 
 
Destinations, Way Stops, and "No Way" Stops 
------------------------------------------- 
¶3.  (SBU) The area we traveled to is known as the "Chao- 
Shan" area, with its populace predominantly speaking a 
branch of the Minnan dialect most commonly known as 
Chaozhou or Teochow.  Renowned for being tough and 
resilient at home, the area is also the origin point of 
many Overseas Chinese, particularly in Thailand and 
Indonesia but with not an inconsiderable number in North 
America as well.  The specific destinations were:  Shanwei 
-- the site of Guangdong province's attempts to create 
energy farms using various technologies and the scene of a 
recent fatal suppression by authorities of civil unrest 
(ref B) and where it was "inconvenient" for any official to 
meet anybody from the Consulate; Shantou -- the least 
successful of the four original Special Economic Zones set 
up by Deng Xiaoping and which actually experienced negative 
growth several years ago; Jieyang -- thousands of people 
flee every year from overcrowding and over used land; 
Chaozhou -- the traditional rival of Guangzhou within 
Guangdong Province until recent times when its wonderful 
culture was ravished by war and the Great Proletarian 
Cultural Revolution and its influence eclipsed by the 
despised "low class" Shantou; and Huizhou -- we stopped for 
a quick visit to television and phone manufacturer TCL to 
give our driver a break in an otherwise very arduously long 
leg back to Guangzhou. 
 
IPR Heart of Darkness -- and Areas of Light, Too 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶4.  (SBU) In line with suggestions from U.S. business 
sector partners to improve IPR protection and enforcement 
in south China, we sought out meetings with local Market 
Order Rectification Offices (MOROs), interagency offices 
designed to deal with problems such as IPR that cross 
 
GUANGZHOU 00010337  002 OF 002 
 
 
boundaries in China's densely stove-piped bureaucracy.  Our 
experiences in Shantou suggest that while helpful, 
cooperation with MOROs is just one more avenue to pursue in 
the otherwise fractured IPR protection and enforcement 
environment of the "heart of darkness" of IPR violations. 
Also with a view to IPR, our college student outreaches at 
Shantou University and Huizhou University focused on the 
relationship between innovation, highly valued by the very 
patriotic Chinese student body as a means for China's march 
to modernity, and IPR protection, a connection which our 
student audience understood intellectually but which did 
not stop them from watching pirated movies. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Septel recounts our "cold-shouldered" experience 
in Shanwei while the first substative report in our "short 
march" series is on Shantou -- which has seen its share of 
economic development rough patches but which is seemingly 
climbing out of them and embarking on some comparatively 
impressive economic growth.
