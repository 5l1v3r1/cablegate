¶1.  (SBU) On May 8, Post's Environment, Science and Technology, and 
Health (ESTH) Counselor together with Australian Deputy Chief of 
Mission Tim Millikan delivered the joint demarche (per REFTEL) 
concerning the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Ship 
Recycling Convention to the Brazilian Ministry of Exterior Relations 
(MRE) Director of the Division on Oceans, Space and Antarctica 
(DMAE), Counselor Fabio Pitaluga and his advisor Andre Tenorio 
Mourao.  Key points and a copy of the Australian proposal were 
provided to Pitaluga. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Pitaluga understood the points.  ESTH Counselor had 
briefed him over the phone on them earlier in the week.  He stated 
that he would share the information provided with the Brazilian 
delegation.  The Brazilian Permanent Representative in London to the 
IMO will head the Brazilian delegation to the meeting in Hong Kong 
and he will be joined by his deputy.  Pitaluga's DMAE Division has 
overall responsibility for the IMO, but the Brazilian Navy would be 
representing Brazil at this meeting and MRE would not be sending 
anyone.  Pitaluga said he had discussed the matter earlier with the 
Navy drawing on the information Post had given him.  He had also 
been in contact with the MRE's division responsible for the World 
Trade Organization (WTO) to discuss the WTO consistency points in 
REFTEL. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Pitaluga noted that the Brazilian Navy had concern about 
allowing non-members to participate because this could reduce the 
incentive for countries to join the new convention and might delay 
or prevent it entering into force.  As highlighted in REFTEL, ESTH 
Counselor and the Australian DCM pointed out that this equivalency 
provision was successfully used in other international environmental 
agreements.  According to Pitaluga, the Brazilian Navy is 
open-minded on the question and would welcome an opportunity to 
discuss with the U.S. and Australian delegations in Hong Kong. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Finally, Pitaluga and Tenorio Mourao commented that Brazil 
has little at stake with this convention.  They said Brazil does not 
currently have a ship recycling industry and in this case is looking 
to preserve the possibility for an industry in the future.  Of 
course, Brazil is interested in protecting the environment in 
general and is pleased to see this convention moving forward.
