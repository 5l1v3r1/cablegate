¶1. (U) The Embassy delivered demarche and background papers 
(reftels) to the Foreign Ministry on January 25, encouraging 
Oman's attendance at the London Conference and pledge for 
Afghanistan reconstruction. 
 
¶2. (SBU) UK Deputy Head of Mission Charles Hill informed us 
on January 24 of his ongoing communications with the MFA 
about the conference.  Regarding attendance, he noted that 
London invited states' participation in two tiers: as 
participants and as observers, with the Afghanistan 
government advising the UK which states belong in which tier. 
 Per Kabul's request, Oman was invited to the London 
Conference only at the observer level, and will therefore be 
represented by the Omani ambassador in London.  With the help 
of that Omani ambassador, the UK embassy in Muscat has been 
prodding the MFA for an Omani financial pledge.  Hill said 
that the MFA recently assured him that it has finally 
received authorization to make a pledge in London, though the 
Ministry would not reveal the amount.  The UK embassy expects 
(as do we) that the pledge will be fairly modest.
