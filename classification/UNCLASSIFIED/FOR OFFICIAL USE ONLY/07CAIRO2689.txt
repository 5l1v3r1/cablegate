(SBU) According to a press report, Rafah city residents 
remain angry over the possibility that the GOE will remove 
buildings within 150 meters of the Gaza border in order to 
enhance security.  A member of the North Sinai Tagammu party, 
Ashraf el Hefny, told a reporter from Egypt's "Daily News" 
that the GOE is prohibiting new building permits within 150 
meters of the border and refusing to grant water or 
electricity permits for buildings within 300 meters of the 
border.  A GOE contact denied the claims about the permits 
and reiterated that internal GOE discussions on this issue 
are in the early stages, and that Egypt expects considerable 
opposition from the locals (see reftel) and is taking 
residents' concerns into consideration.
