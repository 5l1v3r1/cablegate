(This is a joint report from Consulate General Surabaya and US 
Embassy Dili.) 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Embassy Dili and Consulate General Surabaya 
contacted individuals on either side of the Indonesia-Timor 
Leste border regarding the shooting of Timor-Leste citizen Lucas 
Neno by Indonesian Armed forces (TNI).  Neno was shot at 
approximately 4:30 a.m. Timor-Leste local time on October 26. 
Neno died of a single gunshot wound to the abdomen.  So far as 
is known, Neno was killed on Indonesian soil approximately 25 
meters from the Timor Leste border in the Cova Lima District. 
Indonesian press reports highlighted the urgency of reaching 
agreement on the issuance of border crossing cards to avoid 
similar incidents.  End Summary. 
 
The Shooting of Lucas Neno 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Embassy of Australia in Dili provided US Embassy 
Dili with details surrounding the incident and the ongoing 
investigation.  Australian Military Liaison Officer Major Mark 
Cole is the Leader of the Cova Lima Military Liaison Team and is 
assisting the investigating team at the border.  Major Cole 
provided the following preliminary information to Embassy Dili 
regarding the ongoing investigation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The TNI fired on Neno after suspecting he was crossing 
the border illegally.  The Embassy of Australia in Dili has been 
advised that there are several abnormalities relating to the 
shooting incident, such as the fact the crime scene was 
disturbed after the body was moved and before any independent 
source could establish the exact location of the shooting.  The 
body was brought to a mortuary in Atambua (East Nusa Tenggara), 
which is also the Headquarters of the Indonesian Army's 742 
Battalion.  This happened before any independent agency could 
confirm its location with reference to the border and before the 
TNI Military Police arrived on the scene. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Major Cole advised US Embassy Dili that the members of 
the TNI detachment at the border crossing point nearest the 
incident are "very somber and extremely keen to ensure that the 
good relationship between the TNI and Timor Leste Border Patrol 
Unit (BPU) is not strained over the incident."  The Timor Leste 
Border Patrol Unit (BPU) has "not indicated anger or displeasure 
over the shooting", according to Major Cole.  So far, there does 
not appear to be any negative fallout from the incident or 
escalating tensions between the border guard forces of the two 
countries.  Major Cole also reported that the TNI were very 
reticent and nervous, not willing to give details of the 
circumstances pending arrival of the TNI MPs.  They were, 
however, regretful of the incident and emphasized that they did 
not want the incident to damage relations between TNI and Border 
Patrol Unit (BPU) and by extension, Timor-Leste and Indonesia. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Major Cole told US Embassy Dili that while Lucas Neno 
once worked for the BPU as a cook, he has not done so for about 
two years.  Although it is likely that the victim was known to 
at least some of the BPU members, there does not appear to be 
any current personal connection between the victim and either 
the TNI or the BPU.

Incident Adds Urgency to Issue of Border Crossing Card 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
---------- 
 
¶6.  (U) Consulate Surabaya learned from one contact in Atambua, 
NTT that things are calm despite heightened tensions immediately 
after the shooting.  Indonesian press reports surrounding this 
shooting incident focused on the need for regularized border 
crossing cards for residents of the East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) and 
Timor Leste border area.  Indonesia and Timor Leste governments 
plan to roll out a border crossing card in January 2008.  Press 
reports quoted Timor Leste's Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
Zacarias Dacosta, as approving of the manner in which the TNI 
has handled the shooting incident.  Dacosta encouraged speeding 
up issuance of border crossing cards as a means of avoiding 
similar incidents in the future.  According to Indonesian 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hasan Wirajuda, Indonesia and East 
Timor have reached agreement in principle on the border crossing 
card.
