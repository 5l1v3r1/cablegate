 ¶1. (U) On 21 November AgAtt Kate Snipes delivered ref. A 
demarche on the EU discussion regarding a tolerance level for 
low level presence of unapproved biotech products to Dr. 
Andzej Wojtyla, Head of Sanitary Inspection and Emilia 
Kalinska, Specialist on GM Food at the Polish Ministry of 
Health and Dr. Ewa Lech, Chief Veterinary Officer at the 
Polish Ministry of Agriculture. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In separate meetings Kalinska and Lech both said 
that Poland does not have a formal position on the matter of 
low level presence (LLP) at this time due to the change in 
government. Kalinska stated that under the previous coalition 
government led by Law and Justice (PiS) she was confident 
Poland would have been against any tolerance level for LLP 
for unapproved products but noted there may be more 
flexibility in the new government. Lech speculated that the 
new government's position may be more pragmatic regarding ag 
biotech. She added that both the Polish pork industry and the 
Ministry of Agriculture officials responsible for feed are 
aware of the limits of non-GM feed supplies and are concerned 
that limited access to feed would make Polish producers less 
competitive and raise meat prices for Polish consumers. 
 
¶3. (U) Kalinska confirmed that if tolerances were adopted by 
the EU, Poland would have the capacity to test and measure 
them with five laboratories approved as part of the EU 
Network of GM Laboratories (ENGL). 
 
¶4. (U) The formal coalition agreement was signed between 
Civic Platform (PO) and the Polish People's Party (PSL) on 
the morning of November 23.  The official Polish position on 
ag biotech will be decided under this new leadership. (See 
ref. B.)
