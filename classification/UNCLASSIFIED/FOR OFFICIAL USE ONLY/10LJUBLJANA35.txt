1.(SBU) CDA delivered ref A points to Foreign Minister 
Zbogar's chief of staff, Aljaz Arih, on February 7.  Arih 
said Slovenia would support High Representative Ashton's 
efforts and said he would pass along our request for a 
separate Slovenia statement. 
 
2.(SBU) Pol-Econ chief followed up on February 9 by 
delivering ref B demarche to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA) Human Rights Department Head Smiljana Knez.  Knez said 
Slovenia is following the human rights situation in Iran very 
closely through its embassy in Tehran, and in particular, is 
focused on issues surrounding the death penalty, freedom of 
expression and persecution of Iran's Baha'i minority. 
Starting from the time of its EU Presidency in 2008, Slovenia 
has systematically issued statements regarding the Iranian 
regime's human rights abuses and plans to continue doing so 
in the future.  Knez noted that Slovenia has already prepared 
its list of questions and recommendations in advance of next 
week's Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process on Iran. 
Slovenia is currently considering issuing a statement in 
advance of the February 11 anniversary, but is waiting to 
first see Ashton's statement.  Knez expressed appreciation 
for the U.S. talking points and said that the MFA would take 
them into consideration when drafting Slovenia's statement.
