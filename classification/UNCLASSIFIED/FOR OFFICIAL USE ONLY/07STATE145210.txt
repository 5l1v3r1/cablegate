REF: STATE 144892 
 
¶1. (U) This is an urgent action request for USUN.  Please see 
paras 4 and 5 for instructions and text of handover document. 
 
¶2. (U) Background: Per a request by the United Nations, 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations in late 2006, the 
Department of State created a contract to provide logistics 
support to the UN,s Light Support Package (LSP) to the 
African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) on a reimbursable 
basis.  This work, carried out through Pacific Architects and 
Engineers Government Services, Inc. (PAE), included the 
construction of the UN,s largest base camp in El Fasher, 
Darfur, as well as several additional sites in El Fasher, Al 
Geneina, Zalingei and Nyala.  These facilities are intended 
for the use of United Nations personnel deploying to Darfur 
to help bolster AMIS and to pave the way for transition of 
AMIS to a robust, hybrid UN/AU peacekeeping operation.  The 
work carried out by PAE under this task order has been 
inspected by both the US Government Technical Monitor in 
Darfur and UN personnel and has been deemed ready for 
handover from the USG to the UN.  The UN has verbally and via 
email requested that this handover take place as quickly as 
possible.  The attached handover document in para 5 has been 
reviewed by DPKO and the UN,s Office of Legal Affairs, and 
has been approved for signature.  The text has been cleared 
by L/BA, L/LFA, and AF/SPG. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In March 2007, the USG and UN completed negotiations 
on a reimbursable agreement under Section 607 of the US 
Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) for the work in question.  The 
reimbursable agreement was signed by Ambassador Wolff on 
behalf of the USG.  To date, the USG has not received 
reimbursement for the work carried out by the USG contractor 
in Darfur, but has been assured that the funds are 
forthcoming.  In spite of the lack of reimbursement to date, 
the Department deems the handover of these facilities as 
critical for the advance of UN deployment to Darfur and is 
not seeking to delay this process.  However, in delivering 
the handover document in para 5, the Mission should stress 
the need for expeditious reimbursement for work completed and 
should also reiterate the urgent need for DPKO to set up its 
own logistics support contracts in Darfur.  Per reftel, the 
UN has also recently  requested additional support services 
from the USG, including extension of Operations and 
Maintenance (O&M) services at AMIS base camps beyond December 
31, 2007 on a reimbursable basis.  The USG would like clear 
assurance from the UN that it will have in place its own 
contracts by no later than April 1, 2008, and will not seek 
further support from the USG outside the system of assessed 
UN dues. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Department requests the handover document in 
para 5 be signed and transmitted by the US Mission to the 
United Nations to the UN,s Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations, Logistics Support Division for countersignature 
no later than October 17, 2007.  The Mission should use this 
opportunity to (1) reiterate USG support for UN deployment to 
Darfur, (2) stress the need for urgent completion of the 
reimbursement process for work under the LSP, and (3) recall 
the need for a written assurance by the United Nations that 
it will assume responsibility for operations and maintenance 
support of all base camps in Darfur no later than April 1, 
2008, per reftel. The Department further requests that a 
scanned copy of the handover document with signatures by both 
parties be transmitted by the US Mission to the Africa 
Bureau,s Sudan Programs Group for its records.  For 
additional background information, please contact AF/SPG 
Rebecca Jovin (202-647-4597) or Joshua Drake (202-647-2348).
