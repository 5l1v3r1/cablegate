well as casualties incurred. 
 
¶2. (U) During the September 8-15, 2008 reporting period, two 
security officials died, including one in clashes and the other in a 
PKK-linked IED explosion.  Another two were injured in an IED 
explosion.  The total number of security force casualties for the 
year through September 15, 2008, was 104 killed and 157 injured. 
 
¶3. (U) During the same period, five PKK terrorists were killed in 
clashes.  Two PKKers were captured and another three surrendered. 
According to official TGS website figures, through the second week

the number of those captured was 131, and the number of those who 
surrendered was 111. 
 
¶4. (U) During the reporting period one civilian was kidnapped by the 
PKK in Tunceli Province on September 14.  Another civilian was 
injured when he stepped on a landmine.  The total number of civilian
