TO COURT 
 
REF: JAKARTA 7556 (TIMIKA TRIAL LIKELY IN MID-JULY) 
 
¶1. (U) Summary.  Indonesian prosecutors June 21 turned over 
the dossiers of Anthonious Wamang and six co-conspirators in 
the August 31, 2002 murders of two Amcits and one Indonesian 
to the Central Jakarta District Court.  We expect the court 
within ten days to set a trial date and appoint a panel of 
judges.  The judges will likely preside over the two 
concurrently-held trials of both Wamang, who is charged with 
premeditated murder, and his six co-conspirators, who face 
separate, lesser charges.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U)  Further to reftel, Poloff and Legatt met June 15 with 
Anita Asterida, the attorney heading the sub-team that will 
head the prosecution of Anthonious Wamang, who faces charges 
including premeditated murder in connection with the August 
31, 2002 shootings of two Amcits and one Indonesian near 
Timika, Papua. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ms. Asterida anticipated that the trial will begin 
in mid-July, which  tracks with the time frame provided us by 
Deputy Director for Prosecution Domu Sihite (reftel).  Ms. 
Asterida was particularly concerned with the willingness of 
Amcit victim witnesses to testify.  She said that to lend 
maximum credibility to the prosecution's case, at least two 
victim witnesses should appear in person, as opposed to 
merely providing sworn statements.  We assured her that the 
USG has resources to facilitate their appearance.  She in 
turn said that the prosecution would work with the judges to 
ensure the victim witnesses' court appearances would not be 
excessively time-consuming or otherwise onerous. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Ms. Asterida said that the Wamang prosecution team 
would have ten members.  Since some members have other 
responsibilities, this relatively large number will ensure 
that the prosecution will have strong coverage throughout the 
trial, which is expected to last two to three months. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Ms. Asterida later confirmed that, as anticipated, 
the prosecution turned the two separate dossiers for 
Anthonious Wamang and his co-conspirators to Central Jakarta 
District Court on June 22.  In a June 23 conversation with 
poloff, Ms. Asterida said she expected the court to set a 
trial date and appoint a panel of judges within a week to ten 
days.  Although two cases technically exist  -- that of 
Anthonious Wamang and that of his six co-conspirators -- the 
court will handle the two cases together, and the same panel 
of judges will preside at both trials, which will run 
concurrently, Ms. Asterida told us. 
 
¶6.  (U) We will immediately inform addressees when the actual 
trial dates are set.
