¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: At the request of the Ministry of External 
Relations (MINREX), Chief of Mission Farrar met with Josefina 
Vidal Ferreriro, director of Cuba's North America Office on 
November 30 to recieve word of the approval of two Cuban 
nationals asked to testify in the federal criminal case of 
Luis Posada Carriles.  When pressed by COM Farrar for 
responses to other USINT requests, Vidal said that answers to 
other requests are not yet available.  Vidal took this 
opportunity to reiterate Cuban government cooperation on 
previous requests, but then highlighted the Government of 
Cuba's (GOC) position on the "Repatriation Process" for 
several imprisoned Cuban-Americans.  Additionally, Vidal 
reaffirmed Cuba's commitment to host the next round of talks 
in the Migration Accords and asked COM Farrar to follow-up on 
the GOC's proposed dates of February 19 - 20.  END SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Cuban Government to Facilitate Posada Testimony 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Vidal began the November 30 meeting by presenting a 
diplomatic note to COM Farrar stating that the Cuban 
government has agreed to send LTC Roberto Hernandez Caballero 
from the Department of State Security and another witness to 
the United States to testify in the federal criminal trial of 
Luis Posada Carriles.  LTC Hernandez served as the principal 
investigator in the 4 September 1997 bombing at the 
Copacabana Hotel and is prepared to testify on the physical 
evidence collected after the bombing. LTC Hernandez has 
previously testified in U.S. federal court on an unrelated 
criminal matter.  The GOC also approved travel of Mr. Nicolas 
Rodriguez Valdez who was a bartender at the hotel restaurant 
during the 1997 bombing and was an eyewitness to the alleged 
plot.  Vidal emphasized the Cuban government also will make 
all physical evidence available in order to assist with the 
trial.  Vidal asked COM Farrar to respond with proposed dates 
for our requested travel to Cuba of Department of Justice 
(DOJ) and law enforcement representatives to prepare of the 
trail. 
 
------------------------------- 
No News on Other USINT Requests 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) When asked by COM Farrar if MINREX could provide 
answers on other outstanding USINT requests, Vidal responded 
that no other answers are available but indicated that the 
pending visa request for A/OPR/OS Bill Scotti is likely to be 
approved.  As an example of how the Cuban government has 
cooperated with USINT requests, Vidal cited the recent 
approval of the four teams of Diplomatic Security Service 
(DSS) agents who will come to Cuba to assist in Post's DSS 
programs. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Vidal highlighted the GOC's November 27 response to 
our diplomatic note requesting clarification of the GOC's 
"Repatriation Process" for several dual nationals imprisoned 
in Cuba and seeking early release.  COM Farrar noted that the 
GOC's diplomatic note varied with his understanding that the 
prisoners involved seek to return to the United States rather 
than remain in Cuba.  COMMENT: Consul General Mezlow will 
request a meeting with her MINREX counterparts to clarify 
this issue. 
 
------------------------------- 
Second Round of Migration Talks 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Vidal reaffirmed Cuba's commitment to hosting the 
next round of the U.S. - Cuba bilateral Migration Accord 
Talks in Havana.  Vidal explained that the appropriate Cuban 
authorities are now not able to attend during the dates 
proposed by the GOC for January 2010 and asked that COM 
Farrar respond later to the GOC's most recent proposal of 
February 19 - 20, 2010.
