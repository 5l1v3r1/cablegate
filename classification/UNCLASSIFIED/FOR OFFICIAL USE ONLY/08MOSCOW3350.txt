Dr. Ronald K. Jones 
 
Dear Dr. Jones, 
 
The Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary 
Surveillance Service (VPSS) extends its regards 
to the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service 
(FSIS), and informs you of the following. 
 
On December 1, 2008, VPSS intends to start 
issue of import permits for imports of fodder 
and fodder supplements for 2009. Complying with 
the Russian legislation, fodder and fodder 
supplements should be only imported from the 
establishments that are certified by VPSS. 
 
Starting January 1, 2009, import of fodder and 
fodder supplements to the Russian Federation 
will be allowed from the establishments that 
are included by VPSS in the relevant list. In 
this connection we ask you to send us lists of 
U.S. establishments that produce fodder and 
fodder supplements (selected in accordance with 
the attached form), and that delivered their 
products to the Russian Federation in past, and 
that have valid contracts with the Russian 
partners for delivering their products. 
 
In addition we ask you to provide us guarantees 
that these establishments are under permanent 
supervision of the U.S. veterinary service and 
that these establishments will implement all 
Russian veterinary-sanitary requirements and 
norms. 
 
As soon as the mentioned lists are submitted, 
VPSS will analyze them and will approve the 
lists of the establishments-manufacturers of 
fodder and fodder supplements that are eligible 
to export their products from the U.S. to the 
Russian Federation. 
 
In addition we would like to inform you that 
VPSS will have rights to inspect the 
establishments. A decision about import of 
 
products from these establishments will be made 
on the basis of audit results. 
 
Dr. Jones, please accept my assurances in the 
deepest respect.

Â¶2. (SBU) COMMENT: The latest VPSS 
requirement adds fodder to the list of 
products which must come from a facility 
certified by VPSS. (Russia also requires 
that  pork, beef and poultry imports 
originate from facilities certified by 
VPSS.) Post anticipates facility 
certification may shortly be added for fish 
and seafood products, as fish and seafood 
exports from the EU will be subject to this 
requirement as of January 1, 2009. 
According to US export statistics, fodder 
exports to Russia from January-September 
2008 totaled $12 million, up 46 percent from 
the same period last year.
