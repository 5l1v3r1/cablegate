SUBJECT: FINLAND TO SEND A STRONG DELEGATION TO WIREC 
 
REF: SECSTATE 00559 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered the formal invitation for the 
Washington International Conference on Renewal Energy (WIREC) 
to Mr. Henri Backman, Senior Advisor to the Minister in 
Finland's newly-created super Ministry of Employment and the 
Economy.  A strong advocate of renewable energy sources, 
Minister of the Economy Mauri Pekkarinen plans to attend 
WIREC with a delegation of senior officials who cover energy 
issues for the Government of Finland.  According to Backman, 
Minister Pekkarinen would welcome an opportunity to speak on 
either R&D or Agriculture/Rural Development topics during the 
conference. 
 
¶2. (U) Finland already generates approximately 25 percent of 
its energy from renewable resources (85 percent from 
bioenergy ) mostly wood) and this figure is expected to rise 
to 35 percent during the next decade.  The GOF is also 
aggressively funding biofuel R&D projects that will hopefully 
help Finland decrease its greenhouse gas emissions while 
further diversifying its overall energy mix.
