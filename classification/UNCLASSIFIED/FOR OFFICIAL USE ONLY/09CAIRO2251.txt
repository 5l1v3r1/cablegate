ABDEL-FATTAH KHALIFA ABDEL BAKY - CASE NO. K-1135 
 
REF: STATE 99496 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel request, Pol Off met with 
registered broker Abdel Fattah Khalifa at the offices of the 
United Consultant Group.  Khalifa confirmed that he was 
authorized by the Egyptian Ministry of Defense to conduct 
brokering activities in Egypt.  The firm provides mostly 
consulting and construction services, but it does physically 
handle VHF radio equipment.  Khalifa said the company uses a 
secure facility in October 6 city outside of Cairo that has 
24-hour security and restricted access.  The company was 
established in 1992.  The firm employs 42 people in total. 
Khalifa said that 95 percent of his business was with the 
Egyptian military and the remaining business with oil 
companies. Khalifa confirmed that he was familiar with 
restrictions on USML items, including the unauthorized 
re-transfer and re-export of items. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Khalifa explained that his company provided a 
wide-range of consulting and construction services for the 
Egyptian military.  As a retired Air Force officer, most of 
his work was with the Air Force, including consulting on the 
F-16 Aircraft Management System with the Qubic company, 
aircraft navigation systems with the KVH company, VHF 
communications equipment with Dataron, and Predator unmanned 
aerial vehicles with General Automatic.
