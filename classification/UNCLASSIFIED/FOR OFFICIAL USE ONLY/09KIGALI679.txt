¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda 
(ICTR) chief prosecutor Hassan Jallow briefed Kigali-based 
diplomats October 15 on the tribunal's work, anticipated 
closure in 2010 and unresolved legacy issues.  He intends to 
request transfer of some remaining cases to Rwanda, and 
indicated that Rwandan authorities will likely ask donors for 
some assistance in strengthening their capacity to receive 
them.  Post recommends providing USG assistance if possible; 
these issues are of core interest to Rwanda.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On October 15, International Criminal Tribunal for 
Rwandan (ICTR) chief prosecutor Hassan Jallow briefed 
Kigali-based diplomats on the ICTR's work.  Participants 
included diplomats from the UK, Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, 
Germany, Canada, Uganda, Kenya, and the EU, as well as 
locally-based ICTR staff. 
 
Status Report 
------------- 
¶3. (SBU) Jallow expected trials of all current detainees to 
continue through 2010, with appeals lasting through 2012.  Of 
93 indictees, he said, the ICTR has arrested all but 11.  The 
ICTR completed 45 cases , with six acquittals and 39 
convictions;  23 more are now on trial, although 15 of these 
are simply awaiting judgment.  Six more individuals are 
waiting for their trials to start.  The trial of (FNU) 
Karemera, delayed because the defendant was sick, will begin 
in November.  The ICTR, he added, also recently transferred 
two cases to France-its first transfers ever. 
 
Possible Transfers to Rwanda? 
----------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) Regarding the 11 remaining fugitives, Jallow said 
the ICTR expected more arrests before the end of 2009.  Three 
would face trial at ICTR in Arusha;  Jallow planned to ask 
ICTR judges in late 2009 or early 2010 to transfer the 
remaining eight cases to other jurisdictions, including 
Rwanda.  In order to receive cases from abroad, he explained, 
the Government of Rwanda (GOR) already abolished solitary 
confinement for cases transferred from abroad, has 
restructured its witness protection program so that judges 
rather than prosecutors run it, and adopted laws enabling the 
use of testimony by videolink.  He commented that in Rwanda, 
witnesses for the prosecution, not the defense, suffer the 
most harassment.  The GOR still lacked the capacity to 
implement these reforms, however, and Jallow understood that 
Rwanda's Prosecutor General intends to ask for donor 
assistance with training, equipment, technical advice, as 
well as two vehicles and possibly two safe houses.  (Note: 
According to local press, Jallow announced, after a meeting 
with Rwanda's prosecutor general, his intention to ask ICTR 
judges to transfer cases to Rwanda.  End Note.) 
 
Legacy Issues Unresolved 
------------------------ 
¶5. (SBU) Jallow noted there were several outstanding issues 
related to ICTR's closure in future.  The location, 
management of, and access to ICTR-related archives were all 
questions for the UNSC.  ICTR itself preferred that the 
archives remain in the region to allow for easier access by 
African users, including national police forces, and noted 
that some documents would need to remain confidential for 
some time, perhaps 20-30 years.  Another key question was how 
to assemble judges and other legal personnel on a 
case-by-case basis if needed after the ICTR closed. 
 
No Remorse 
QNo Remorse 
---------- 
¶6. (SBU) When asked about the status of reconciliation 
efforts in Rwanda, Jallow said the GOR's National Unity and 
Reconciliation Council had informed him there were still many 
problems, including intolerance in schools propagated by 
parents and teachers.  "We should remain concerned for a long 
time," he emphasized, adding that intimidation of 
witnesses-especially prosecution witnesses-was a recurring 
problem, particularly in the areas around Ruhengeri, Gisenyi 
and Gitarama.  When the ICTR publishes its witness lists in 
advance of trials, Jallow said it often finds that its 
primary witnesses become the subject of gacaca trials. 
(Note:  Gacaca is a nationwide system of local courts 
intended to foster reconciliation as well as mete out justice 
for genocide-related crimes, and has dealt with over 1.6m

cases since its inception in 2006.  End Note.) 
 
Prosecution of Alleged RPF War Crimes 
------------------------------------- 
¶7. (SBU) Responding to a question about prosecuting members 
of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) for alleged killings of 
civilians during the 1994 genocide, Jallow said such 
allegations do fall within the ICTR's jurisdiction and that 
"there is a unit working on this."  The ICTR did not have 
authority to investigate the downing of the presidential 
aircraft in 1994, just before the genocide began, however, 
and the GOR in 2008 did prosecute and convict some RPF 
officers of war crimes committed at Kabgayi.  (Note:  The GOR 
convicted two lower-level officers, acquitting two of their 
higher-ranking colleagues.  End Note.)  Jallow strongly 
disagreed with critics who charged that if the ICTR failed to 
prosecute RPF members, it would amount to "victor's justice," 
saying that the most important thing was that criminals be 
held accountable somewhere.  The ICTR already had to "let go" 
of many cases against possible genocidaires as part of its 
completion strategy, and its primary focus was the genocide, 
not war crimes. 
 
¶8. (SBU) COMMENT:  If and when the GOR does request 
assistance, post believes it would be in the USG's interest 
to consider the request favorably, if funds or other 
resources are available.  ICTR-related issues are of great 
importance to the GOR because they impact reconciliation and 
justice--issues still very much alive throughout Rwandan 
society.  The question of Rwanda's suitability to receive 
case transfers, likewise touches on an issue of critical 
importance to the GOR,  good governance, which is at the 
heart of its leaders' vision for the future of this country. 
END COMMENT.
