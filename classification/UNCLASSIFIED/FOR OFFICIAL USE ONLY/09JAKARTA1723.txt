¶1.  (U) This is an Action Message.  Please see para 3. 
 
¶2.  (U) Per reftel, Poloff provided a briefing on the 
upcoming Sous-Sherpa and Sherpa meetings in advance of the 
April 2010 Nuclear Security Summit to Andy Rachmianto, Deputy 
Director of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) 
Directorate for International Security and Disarmament.  In 
response to that information and to our reminder of the 
opportunity for the GOI to provide comment on the Possible 
Summit Outcomes paper, Rachmianto said that Indonesia looks 
forward to participating in the full range of meetings in the 
run-up to the summit. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Rachmianto noted that Indonesia has yet to name a 
Sherpa or Sous-Sherpa since it not yet received a formal 
invitation to the summit.  The GOI understands that it is an 
invitee, but for internal reasons cannot fully engage until 
it has received a formal invitation.  Mission requests that 
Department forward the GOI's formal invitation as soon as 
possible.
