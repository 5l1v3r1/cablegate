SUBJECT: NO PROGRESS IN DPA IMPLEMENTATION IN LAST TWO WEEKS 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Contacts from the Sudan Liberation Movement of 
Minni Minnawi told poloffs November 2 that there has been no 
progress in implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) in 
the last two weeks, and limited overall progress since the September 
19 deal between Minnawi and Vice President Taha.  The GoS continues 
to stall on allocating money to the Darfur Reconstruction and 
Development Fund. Frustration within the movement is rising.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
NO PROGRESS AT ALL IN LAST 2 WEEKS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶2.  (SBU)  On November 2, SLM/MM General Counsel and the 
Transitional Darfur Regional Administration (TDRA) Legal Secretary, 
Abdulaziz Sam, told poloff that there has been absolutely no 
progress in implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) in 
the last two weeks.  Sam said that the travel of Atta Al-Mannan (one 
of the NCP's key brokers of the September 19 Minnawi-Taha agreement) 
has negatively impacted the negotiations.  Sam also stated that it 
is possible that some NCP hardliners within the NCP intentionally 
sent Al-Mannan outside of Sudan to slow the peace process.  Sam said 
that the others who worked with Al-Mannan on the peace deal "are 
worthless" and hinted that he sees NCP hardliners winning the battle 
to marginalize SLM/MM again. 
 
COMMON REFRAIN: WHERE'S THE MONEY? 
---------------------------------- 
¶3.  (SBU)  SLM/MM still has not received any money for the TDRA or 
the DRDF. This remains the primary point of contention with the GoS, 
stated Sam.  He added that the GoS has focused on bureaucratic 
impediments, legal minutiae, and the wording of the DPA to delay 
funding the DRDF.  For example, stated Sam, GoS officials told 
SLM/MM representatives that before funding is allocated to the DRDF 
a comprehensive development plan should be completed at both the 
state and federal levels.  Sam also noted that SLM/MM and GoS 
officials continue to dispute particular development projects, the 
employment of national construction companies, and the percentage of 
funds delivered in seed money vs. in-kind development.  Sam added 
that DRDF Chairman Abduljabar Dausa (also SLM/MM's former political 
chief) traveled to London approximately two weeks ago, and that he 
will not return to Sudan unless the DRDF is funded. 
 
"THIS IS A POLITICAL DECISION." 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶4.  (SBU)  Sam acknowledged that the problem of funding the DRDF is 
not one of mechanics, details, or bureaucracy, but rather a 
political decision by the NCP.  "They [the NCP] have told us [in the 
SLM/MM] that you will take the money we give to the DRDF, and go buy 
weapons in preparation for the next war," stated Sam.  Sam added 
that the NCP also fears that if they deliver money to SLM/MM, 
Minnawi may become less flexible in his willingness to accept a new 
Darfur Peace deal with non-signatory movements in the next round of 
negotiations. 
 
LITTLE PROGRESS IN OTHER AREAS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶5.  (SBU)  Although there has not been direct conflict between 
SLM/MM and GoS forces in Darfur since September 19, Sam 
characterized GoS-SLM/MM military cooperation as "slow."  With 
respect to bringing the DPA into the national constitution, Sam said 
that the National Constitutional Review Commission has held up the 
process, and that he was less optimistic that the DPA would be 
legally recognized in the next month.  (Note: This represents a 
change from our last meeting with Sam two weeks ago when he was very 
confident that the DPA would be quickly adopted into the interim 
constitution.  End Note.)  Sam said that although there has been 
agreement on expanding Darfuri participation in the national civil 
service and senior diplomatic and government positions, SLM/MM has 
been slow to provide lists of names and put pressure on their NCP 
interlocutors. 
 
MINNAWI'S PLANS 
- - - - - - - - 
¶6.  (SBU)  Minnawi returned to Darfur on October 30 after 
participating in the Sudan People's Initiative, reported Sam.  The 
GoS authorized Minnawi to pursue outreach to non-signatory rebel 
movements.  While in Darfur, Minnawi will attempt to meet with JEM, 
SLA-Unity, and URF.  According to Sam, Minnawi realizes that the 
Government "used" him for their propaganda campaign, and that he 
received little in return.  Sam said that Minnawi will travel back 
and forth between his camps in North Darfur as well as to and from 
El-Fasher and Khartoum for the foreseeable future.  Sam added 
Minnawi recognizes that he needs to balance his attention on 
political matters in El-Fasher and Khartoum as well as focusing on 
his military organization.  (Note:  Minnawi is scheduled to speak

with A/S Frazer on October 3 via satellite phone.  End Note) 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - - 
¶7.  (SBU)  Compared to our last meeting with Sam two weeks ago, 
there was a dramatic change in his tone, demeanor, and outlook. 
Increasingly frustrated and pessimistic, Sam may be representative 
of SLM/MM as a whole.  The NCP's tactic of focusing on the details 
and bureaucracy of a peace deal (while neglecting inconvenient 
passages, the timeframe of its implementation, and its overall 
spirit) has been all too evident in the DPA, CPA, and ESPA.  Given 
its weak position, SLM/MM will have to continue to cooperate with 
the NCP while also recognizing its supporting role in the latter's 
political strategy.
