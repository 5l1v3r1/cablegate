SUBJECT: INL Baghdad October Highlights 
 
REF: BAGHDAD 2884 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Embassy Baghdad's International Narcotics and Law 
Enforcement (INL) office supports the development of rule of law in 
Iraq through police, judiciary, corrections, and anti-corruption 
programs.  In response to challenges facing the GOI, INL Baghdad has 
worked throughout October to develop Iraqi institutional capacity. 
Following the October 25 bombing of the shared Ministry of Justice 
(MOJ)/Higher Judicial Council (HJC) building, INL Baghdad offered 
and/or lent essential resources to the Iraqi Higher Judicial Council 
(HJC) to help their leaders re-establish control over critical 
ministerial functions.  INL Baghdad also has advanced its core 
programs, including the Judicial Development Institute (JDI), 
international police advisors (IPA), Iraq Justice Integration 
Project (IJIP), and Judicial Protective Program (JPP).  End 
Summary. 
 
INL Assists HJC After October 25 Bombing 
------------------------------------------ 
¶2. (SBU) A car bomb heavily damaged the shared MOJ/HJC building, 
October 25.  In support of the HJC, INL Baghdad granted 20 new 
laptops and 10 cubicles with associated office furniture.  In 
addition, we are lending on a six-month basis twelve vehicles.  INL 
Baghdad also has begun coordinating the early "beneficial occupancy" 
of HJC's INL-funded JDI campus for use as interim office space. 
(NOTE: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers agreement is required before 
beneficial occupancy can occur.  END NOTE) INL Baghdad is 
collaborating with the MOJ on the development of a separate 
assistance package that will create a continuity operations center. 
 
KRG Requests Additional INL Training 
------------------------------------ 
¶3. (SBU) The Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) has requested 
additional specialized police training from INL Baghdad.  KRG Deputy 
Interior Minister Kamaran has asked for two female IPAs to teach 
Iraqi KRG police women as part of a greater Erbil-based community 
policing training initiative.  The Sulaymaniyah provincial police 
chief also requested two highly skilled IPAs to teach complex 
investigations management.  INL Baghdad manages the Kurdish region 
police training program independent of U.S. military assistance. 
Iraq Police Advisor and Training Mission (ITAM) Commanding Officer 
Major General Rowe (USA) complimented INL Baghdad, October 30, on 
the quality of IPAs in the Kurdish region. 
 
JDI Structures Developing 
------------------------- 
¶4.  (SBU) The HJC has moved forward with governance and 
administrative structures for the INL-supported JDI facility.  In 
cooperation with the GOI, INL has built JDI to be used for ongoing 
HJC training and development.  On September 30, the JDI Consultative 
Body informed us that they have nominated a facility director and 
have established an official administrative unit.  The new director 
will become a member of the Consultative Body and will manage the 
day to day affairs of the facility.  The Consultative Body has 
changed the name to JDI from the Judicial Education and Development 
Institute (JEDI) in order to differentiate it from the Judicial 
Training Institute (JTI), which provides basic and entry-level 
training.  We are working with the Army Corps of Engineers to finish 
final construction details and hope to officially open JDI in early 
Qfinal construction details and hope to officially open JDI in early 
December. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) HJC commitments to curriculum development are accelerating 
as office and work space approach completion.  Courses for judges, 
judicial investigators, judicial security personnel, and court 
administrators are reaching advances stages of development in topics 
ranging from evidence to international arbitration.  Partnerships 
with other USG and international entities are maturing under the 
HJC's guidance. 
 
HJC Provides Security Training Input 
------------------------------------ 
¶6. (SBU) INL Baghdad's judicial security team met with the HJC's 
judicial security training and curriculum committee, October 13-14, 
to discuss the JDI judicial security training curriculum.  The HJC 
Security Manager, Karkh Appellate Court Security Chief and head HJC 
trainer, Rusafa Justice Palace Security Chief, the JDI Security 
Chief designate, and lead female trainer provided comments on the 
INL Baghdad proposals, proposed additional areas of training, and 
 
BAGHDAD 00002946  002 OF 002 
 
 
requested personal security detail (PSD) training assistance.  The 
committee approved 11 courses focused on developing PSD and 
facilities protection service (FPS) basic skills. 
 
INL Training Leads to AQI Fugitive Apprehension 
--------------------------------------------- - 
¶7. (SBU) Iraqi police are making good use of Automated Fingerprint 
Identification System (AFIS)training provided by INL-sponsored IPAs. 
 Provincial police captured 11 of the 16 suspected-AQI prisoners who 
escaped from a Tikrit jail on September 24 by using information 
retrieved from AFIS.  The Crime Scene Investigator Chief was so 
impressed with AFIS and his police's ability to use the program that 
he has purchased one for each of the three prisons in the province. 
 
ICORs Develop DynCorp Review Procedures 
--------------------------------------- 
¶8.  (SBU) ICORs have developed a draft 100 percent property 
accountability review plan for DynCorp International (DI).  The 
review includes CONUS and Iraq locations.  The Property 
Accountability Review teams will operate out of DI HUBs and travel 
to DI spokes to conduct 100 percent physical inventory.  The first 
review starts November 1-28 at 15 sites in HUBs Baghdad, Mosul, and 
Sulaymaniyah.  The second, beginning November 29, will focus on 10 
sites in Tikrit and Al-Kut HUBs and the third, starting on January 
5, will look at 13 sites in HUBs Tallil, Basrah, and Ramadi.  The 
fourth is scheduled to begin at Florida and Virginia facilities in 
December.  ICOR plans to review the results of DI's inventory in 
February 2010. 
 
MOJ Builds IT Capacity 
---------------------- 
¶9. (SBU) INL Baghdad is seeing positive signs of Iraqi buy-in for 
software development.  Under the guidance of the IJIP team, the MOJ 
IT department has for the first time installed an Oracle Environment 
using Oracle Configuration Tool, Oracle SQL Developer, and Oracle 
Form Builder.  The MOJ application supports both the MOJ and the 
Iraqi Corrections Service (ICS) Headquarters.  The program is 
designed to take data from the prison data management system and 
allow the two headquarters to conduct analysis and run reports. 
Justice Minister Dara established a steering committee comprised of 
key staff for the project earlier this year.  INL is working to 
identify alternatives to maintain momentum following the October 25 
bombing. 
 
INL Hands Over Camp Blackhawk to GOI 
------------------------------------ 
¶10. (SBU) INL Baghdad has received approval to abandon in-place 14 
containerized housing units (CHU) the former-INL Camp Blackhawk. 
Releasing property is the last step in transitioning Camp Blackhawk 
over to the GOI under the Iraqi Civilian Assistance Support (ICAS) 
program, which began with turning over the camp itself on September 
¶30.  The MOD is using the facility to house its Special Forces 
Headquarters.
