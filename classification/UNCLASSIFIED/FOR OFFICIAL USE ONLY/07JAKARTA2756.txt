¶2. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Diana Emilla, 
Deputy Director for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs at 
the Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU), underscoring that 
Indonesia--as East Asia's largest democracy and a key player 
in ASEAN--should support the draft resolution condemning rape 
as an instrument of state policy.  Poloff also urged 
Indonesia to cosponsor the resolution. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Emilla responded that Indonesia supported the draft 
resolution, but the GOI had not yet decided whether it would 
be a cosponsor.  She promised to inform Mission if Indonesia 
decided to cosponsor the resolution, but thought that the 
decision to do so or not would be made in New York as the 
senior GOI officials responsible for this type of issue were 
already there for UN meetings.
