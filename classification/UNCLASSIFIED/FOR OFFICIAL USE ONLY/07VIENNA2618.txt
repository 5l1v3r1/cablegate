SUBJECT: AUSTRIAN RESPONSE TO USG QUESTIONS ON SEPTEMBER 25 
NOTICE ON BANK SEPAH 
 
REF: A) VIENNA 2574 B) STATE 139494 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Following up on his interim response (ref A) to ref 
B questions, Markus Zehentner, Deputy Director of the 
Austrian National Bank's (ANB) Legal Division, contacted 
EconUnit Chief on October 12.  Zehentner maintained that 
Austria's September 25 notification to the UNSCR regarding 
payments to Bank Sepah was, at this moment, purely 
hypothetical.  According to Zehentner there are no pending 
payments to Bank Sepah and the ANB has not received any 
applications for authorizations of payments under paragraph 
15 of UNSCR 1737.  The Austrian notification was prompted by 
similar requests from other EU Member States (Germany, United 
Kingdom, and Italy). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Zehentner added that, because there were no payment 
applications pending, the ANB could not answer the more 
specific questions in ref B.  Zehentner emphasized that the 
ANB would review any requests for payments to Bank Sepah 
under paragraph 15 of UNSCR 1737 and paragraph 4 of UNSCR 
¶1747.  Most notably, the payment would have to be under 
contracts entered into force before the listing of Bank Sepah 
under Annex I of UNSCR 1747.
