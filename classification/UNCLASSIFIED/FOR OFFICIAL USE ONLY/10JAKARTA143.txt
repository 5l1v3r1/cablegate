Minister of Trade of The Republic of Indonesia 
 
Jakarta, January 26, 2010 
Our Ref. 130/M-DAG/SD/1/2010 
 
His Excellency 
Ambassador Ron Kirk 
United States Trade Representative 
600 17th Street N.W. 
Washington, D.C. 20508 
United States of America 
 
Dear Ambassador Kirk: 
 
     First of all I wish you a belated Happy New Year 2010, may our 
bilateral relation continue to prosper this year and the years to 
come. 
 
     I must apologize for not replying sooner to your letter of 
November 6, 2009, which was due to the need to reconfirm issues 
raised in your letter to the concerned Ministries. 
 
     As for the Minister of Health's Regulation Number 1010 on 
Registration of Medicines, I would like to inform you that according 
to the Ministry of Health no proposal has so far been put forward by 
foreign companies on the changes of existing regulations. 
Concerning Decree Number 245, the Ministry of Health is planning to 
revise the Decree, especially the technical aspects, to adapt with 
associated rules and regulations.  Stakeholders will be given the 
opportunity to provide inputs, and as such, this opportunity may be 
taken to raise the proposal on the quality assurance standards. 
 
     On the regulation concerning halal products, I am pleased to 
note that your Administration acknowledges the right of Indonesia to 
regulate trade in halal products.  I wish to reassure you that we 
uphold the importance of being transparent in order to minimize 
unwanted disruptions in trade.  In this respect, the BPOM/NA-DFC 
(Badan Pengawas Obat dan Makanan/the National Agency of Drug and 
Food Control) on several occasions has conducted dissemination of 
information programs, attended by various stakeholders and partner 
countries, including IPMG (International Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers Group).  I understand that a review of the regulation 
is being undertaken with the aim of clarifying its substance and 
purpose to include considerations related to facilitating 
registration requirements.  I must add that this regulation is 
non-discriminatory; it applies to domestic as well as foreign 
products.  Indonesia will notify all WTO members, once the revision 
of the regulation is finalized. 
 
     Last but not least I would like to emphasize that I do share 
your commitment to expand investment and trade between our two 
countries. 
 
     Thank you for your kind attention. 
 
 
 
Yours sincerely, 
Mari Elka Pangestu
