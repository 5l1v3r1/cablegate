(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche November 26 to Martin 
Romero in the Argentine MFA's Office for International 
Organizations.  Romero welcomed the U.S. message and said 
that Argentina sought to play a constructive role on Middle 
East issues.  He noted as well that, "like the U.S.," 
Argentina was a nation of immigrants and had significant 
communities supportive of both sides of the 
Israeli-Palestinian question.  He well understood the U.S. 
point about the disproportionate number of General Assembly 
resolutions focused on Israel, but added that the Ministry 
would have to study the content and history of each 
resolution, with input from appropriate offices, before he 
could speculate on how Argentina might vote.  He undertook to 
share the USG concerns about the number and content of the 
anti-Israel resolutions within the MFA as it considered 
voting instructions.
