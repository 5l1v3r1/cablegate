¶2.  (SBU) On February 28, poloff met with Azzedine Farhane, 
UN Division Chief at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to 
discuss Iran's failure to comply with its international 
obligations as required under UNSCR 1737 (reftel a).  Farhane 
welcomed U.S views on the IAEA report, and in response said 
Morocco is also concerned with Iran's nuclear program and its 
defiance of the international communiy.  He explained the 
GOM supports resolutions tht seek to counter nuclear 
threats.  He noted, howver, that all UN resolutions (not 
just Iran-speific resolutions) should be fully implemented. 
Farhane conveyed the GOM's desire that the Iran issue be 
resolved diplomatically through negotiations, rather than 
militarily.  We want to avoid another conflict in the region, 
he said. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Per reftel b instructions, poloff passed to Farhane 
the text of the U.S. 60-day report on efforts toward 
implementing UNSCR 1737 in response to a query on U.S. 
actions to date.   Poloff urged Morocco to fully and 
effectively implement the resolution.  Farhane explained that 
the GOM has not yet decided on whether it will present a 
60-day report, but promised to keep the embassy apprised of 
the GOM's decision. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Farhane pledged to relay the U.S. position 
regarding Iranian compliance to the Minister and to the 
Moroccan mission in Vienna.
