¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY: The Turkish government and BP are set 
on July 13 as the date for the official ceremony marking 
completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline. 
The Turks are focusing on high level participation, 
including from the United States, but have not yet 
delivered invitations.  We recommend that Energy 
Secretary Bodman lead the USG representation, and we urge 
 
SIPDIS 
a decision soon to ensure that we can secure hotel rooms 
and make other arrangements.  First tanker loading is 
still targeted for May 27.  End Summary.

July 13 Ceremonial First Oil and Gala - Still no Invites 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Based on conversations with BP and the Turkish 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Energy, the following 
scenario appears under development for the July 13 
official ceremony for inaugurating the BTC pipeline 
(refs).  MFA DDG Energy Mithat Rende is the point person 
for the Turkish Government. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The plan remains to hold the opening ceremony 
on the 13th at the new BTC sea terminal near the town of 
Ceyhan.  Given expected high temperatures in July, the 
length of the ceremony would be kept short and air- 
conditioned facilities would be provided.  As there is 
limited hotel space in the nearby city of Adana (40-45 
minutes from Ceyhan by road), the MFA expects that most 
foreign guests will stay in Istanbul (approximately 1.5 
hours from Adana by air).  On the morning of the 
ceremony, participants would fly from Istanbul to Adana 
on a special plane and travel by bus or helicopter to 
Ceyhan.  Following the ceremony, participants would 
return to Istanbul via Adana for a formal dinner that 
would be hosted by President Sezer or Prime Minister 
Erdogan at the Dolmabahce Palace on the Bosphorus. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Although still in the planning stages, the 
Turkish government is aiming for a major international 
event that will highlight the role of BTC and Turkey in 
the global energy system.  It is eager for high level 
participation from the U.S. and UK governments as well as 
BTC consortium countries.  Turkish and BP officials 
regularly mention their hope that Secretary Bodman and 
Prince Andrew, as well as BP Chairman Browne will attend. 
They have also long hoped that the President or Vice 
President would be available, but seem to rcognize that 
the odds of this happening are dminishing as time passes 
without a firm date having been set. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Post recommends that the USG representation at 
this event be led by Energy Secretary Bodman.  We urge 
that Secretary Bodman consider adding a day of 
consultations with Turkish officials in Ankara on next 
steps in our bilateral energy dialogue.  Post notes that 
during the tourist season, hotel rooms in Istanbul can be 
hard to find.  We need to hear soon from Washington who 
may be representing the U.S., especially if more than a 
few rooms are necessary.

Oil Marches On 
-------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Meanwhile, oil (and the mechanical "pigs") 
were pumped onwards from Pump Station Four in northern 
Turkey on May 5 and the project is still on target for 
first tanker loading on May 27.  BP told us that there 
will not likely be a big public affairs announcement to 
avoid competing with the July 13 event, but they 
anticipate press coverage.  BP tells us that there is 
still no resolution with BOTAS in the dispute over cost 
over-runs (refs), but the dispute does not appear to be

holding up completion.
