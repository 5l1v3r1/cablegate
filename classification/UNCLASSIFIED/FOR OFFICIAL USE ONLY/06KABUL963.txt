KABUL 00000963  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Helmand Governor Daud told 
visiting Combined Forces Command/Afghanistan Deputy 
Commanding General (DCG) Major General Wilson on 
March 4th that he is concerned over eradication 
security and the apparent lack of provisions for the 
Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National 
Police (ANP).  On the political front, the Governor 
is worried that the Taliban may use the eradication 
campaign to sow more hostility towards the 
provincial government.  General Wilson advised the 
Governor to take a "sure and safe" approach to 
eradication to avoid upsetting the balance of 
security in the province.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------- 
SECURITY 
-------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) As he has done on numerous occasions, 
Governor Daud expressed concern over the security 
situation.  Specifically, the logistics for the ANA 
and the ANP do not appear to be in place, thus 
limiting their utility.  He noted especially the 
lack of ammunition for the police.  The Governor 
said that as many of the local police used their own 
weapons and these were not registered ANP weapons, 
the MOI was not supplying ammunition.  The Interior 
Minister had agreed to do so, but Daud stated that 
bureaucracy was preventing the actual supply.  The 
ANP sent from Kabul had arrived by bus and lacked 
transport, fuel, and food.  Other ANA located around 
the Sangin area are tied down because of recurring 
attacks.  In addition to the logistics problems, 
Provincial officials, with CFC-A assistance, only 
began setting up the Joint Command Center on March 
¶5. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The Governor also expressed concern about 
the 500 "auxiliary" ANP that he intends to use for 
the eradication campaign.  He concluded that he must 
keep 200 in Lashkar Gah as a quick reaction force. 
While the Governor claimed that they are 
"registered," he also noted that they are untrained. 
The Governor is also concerned about the financial 
picture, noting that he has not been given 
additional funds to support this force.  General 
Wilson agreed with the Governor that the situation 
is not satisfactory 
--------- 
STABILITY 
--------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  On the political front, Governor Daud 
expressed concern that the Taliban will take 
advantage of the eradication campaign to convince 
people to oppose the government. The Governor said 
that many farmers whose fields are eradicated will 
be angry.  They have expectations that help, in the 
form of alternative livelihoods, will follow 
eradication.  If that does not materialize, there 
will likely be increased support for the Taliban, 
which could be a destabilizing factor.  The Governor 
said that, with the security factors and the limited 
government capacity, the eradication campaign "will 
 
KABUL 00000963  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
be very difficult."  On the positive side, the 
Governor stated that, if the eradication campaign is 
successful, it will be a sign of the Government of 
Afghanistan's ability to extend its influence and 
lead to a more stable Helmand. 
 
----------------- 
MEASURED APPROACH 
----------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Governor Daud said that, regarding 
eradication, he is under pressure from many 
directions, including the MOI, the Ministry of 
Counternarcotics, and the US and UK embassies.  He 
is determined to move ahead, noting that there must 
be a "strong effort," to show the people that there 
is governance and rule of law in Helmand province. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  General Wilson advised the Governor to 
take a steady and safe approach.  The DCG noted 
that, if he assessed that security might seriously 
deteriorate, it might be advisable to adjust the 
eradication plan.  He urged the Governor not to 
place too much public emphasis on a particular 
target; nor should the Governor feel pressurized to 
reach a particular target as he should be the one to 
judge how fast and far to push.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  While the US-led Afghan Eradication Force 
is in place and ready to go, it appears that pulling 
the logistics together for the security forces is a 
major challenge.  The Governor is walking a 
difficult line on the eradication campaign. 
Security is fragile - in Sangin, for example, where 
the district chief was murdered on March 3, there is 
virtually no government control.  Whether the 
eradication campaign will add or detract from 
provincial governance remains an open question.
