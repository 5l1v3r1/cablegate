REVIEW SESSION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 7242 
 
(SBU) PolOff discussed reftel points with the MFA's Human 
Rights and International Organizations Department Head Kinga 
Simon January 29.  Simon stated that Hungary will provide an 
oral statement during the periodic review rather than 
submitting written recommendations, as the oral statement 
will be more visible and hopefully have more impact.  She 
said Hungary will address many of the same issues highlighted 
by the USG, including the following: violations of religious 
freedom; discrimination against religious minorities; 
nationality issues related to children with only one Iranian 
citizen parent; and violent crackdowns by the government 
following the 2009 elections.  In addition, Simon said that 
Hungary will express its opposition to the death penalty 
provisions in Iran.
