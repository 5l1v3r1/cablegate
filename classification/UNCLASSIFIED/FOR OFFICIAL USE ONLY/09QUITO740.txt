¶1. (SBU) Summary: The H1N1 influenza virus continues its gradual 
expansion in Ecuador, with Ecuadoran press reporting August 14 that 
several GoE employees close to President Correa have recently become 
infected.  These include one of Correa's closest Ministers and the 
chief of his security detail.  GoE personnel close to the President, 
as well as the President himself, are under medical observation.  On 
August 14 the embassy received a diplomatic note addressed to 
foreign missions and international organizations warning the foreign 
delegations that attended President Correa's August 10 inauguration 
to take appropriate precautions.  The GoE reports 21 deaths and 682 
cases of H1N1 flu to date.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On August 13, the Ministry of Public Health confirmed to 
the public that Ecuador's Minister of Policy, Ricardo Patino, and 
presidential Security Chief Johnny Merino had become infected with 
the H1N1 virus.  Patino and Merino are in a local hospital receiving 
Tamiflu treatment.  (Patino is in stable condition, but Merino is in 
intensive care).  A second presidential security guard has also 
contracted the H1N1 virus. 
 
¶3. (SBU) GoE Vice Minister of Health Marcelo Aguilar stated to local 
media that, "Anyone who has been in close contact with the infected 
people is under observation, including the President."  President 
Correa is reportedly asymptomatic.  The President's spokesman told 
Econoff August 14 that the presidential press room and the 
President's office have been disinfected.  All visitors to the 
President's office in Carondelet Palace, including press, must wear 
protective masks. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Ministry of Foreign Relations formally informed all 
diplomatic missions and international organizations in a diplomatic 
note dated August 12 (but which arrived August 14) of the H1N1 cases 
among President Correa's staff.  In the dipnote, the Ministry warns 
that all foreign delegations that may have had contact with GoE 
authorities during the President's August 10 inaugural events should 
take appropriate precautions.  It also asks that any cases of H1N1 
that may have derived from contact with infected individuals in 
Ecuador be reported back to the GoE. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The GOE reports 21 fatalities and a total of 682 confirmed 
cases of H1N1 flu as of August 14 throughout Ecuador.  However, 
since many influenza cases go unreported, the real number of cases 
is likely to be significantly higher.  (GOE public health 
interventions were reported refs A and B.)  According to the GoE 
Ministry of Health's website, H1N1 influenza cases are distributed 
among the provinces as follows: Guayas (Guayaquil)(237), Pichincha 
(Quito)(145), El Oro (21), Manabi (Manta)(35), Azuay (Cuenca)(52), 
Caar (8), Chimborazo (35), Tungurahua (12), Pastaza (10),Carchi 
(6), Esmeraldas (12),Loja (45), Morona Santiago (7), Napo (3),Los 
Rios (16), Cotopaxi (6), Imbabura (6), Zamora Chinchipe (6), Santo 
Domingo (5), Santa Elena (4), Orellana (1), and Bolivar (9).
