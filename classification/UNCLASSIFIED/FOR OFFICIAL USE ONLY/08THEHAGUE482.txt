SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 3 and 4, U.S. Delreps met with 
representatives of the UK and Italy, and separately with 
Libya, to share the non-paper from Reftel and discuss Libyan 
steps necessary for the U.S. to approve the request to retain 
the sandbag wall around the former chemical weapons 
production facility at Rabta. Delreps received little new 
information, but the Libyan representative said he would 
transmit the non-paper promptly to Tripoli and report on any 
follow-up.

MEETING WITH UK AND ITALY 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On June 3, Delreps met with members of the UK and 
Italian delegations to share the U.S. proposed approach and 
non-paper. The UK and Italian reps were grateful for the 
non-paper and seemed to agree with the approach outlined. 
All agreed that it would be important to continue close 
communication regarding positions on Libyan delays and 
transparency. Of note, the Italian rep mentioned that Libyan 
expert Dr. Hesnawy had admitted in a recent conversation that 
Libya was in fact two months behind schedule on its 
destruction program. While not significant in terms of time, 
this admission is a departure from Hesnawy,s usual 
conviction that nothing could possibly take the destruction 
project off track.

MEETING WITH LIBYA 
------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) On June 4, Delreps met with Mr. Mohadeb Gheton, the 
sole Libyan representative remaining in The Hague following 
their Embassy,s closure. Delreps conveyed the points in 
paragraph 7 of Reftel, and provided a copy of the non-paper. 
Delreps noted that the U.S. was also requesting an audience 
in Tripoli, and hoped this would occur without delay. Gheton 
committed to transmit the non-paper immediately, and to 
contact the U.S. Del with any reaction from Tripoli. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On the topic of transparency, Gheton offered his 
view that the delays were probably not tied to any specific 
problems, but more likely a result of the process simply 
taking longer than expected, both bureaucratically and 
operationally. He underscored Libya,s commitment to its CWC 
obligations. Delreps noted the scrutiny CWC deadlines tend 
to receive in the Executive Council (EC), and that providing 
a clear explanation for delays and future work in the form of 
a national paper could be very helpful for Libya in the event 
of queries from other States Parties. Gheton was obviously 
unclear as to what precisely was required in terms of a 
national paper; Delrep clarified that it would be important 
to have an official document, as outlined in the non-paper, 
that would have a standing that the informal presentations 
would not. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On the scheduling of a visit to Rabta, Gheton stated 
frankly that he understood the last visit to have been 
canceled because of U.S./UK attempts to broaden the agenda. 
He also shared his understanding that Tripoli is still 
working toward a visit before the June EC, and that there may 
now be a series of bilateral visits offered to the U.S., UK 
and Italy. Finally, he expressed his appreciation for U.S. 
assistance and guidance, and committed to share any feedback 
he receives from Tripoli.
