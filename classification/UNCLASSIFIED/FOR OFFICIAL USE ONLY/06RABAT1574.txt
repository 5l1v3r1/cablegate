¶1.  (U)  Summary:  On August 21, Morocco celebrated the 
fifty-third anniversary of the "Revolution of the King and 
the People Day."  The king's speech underlined the 
significance of citizens uniting to "build a modern Morocco 
and turn the country into a highly motivated, enterprising 
and dedicated nation, boasting plenty of ambition and 
resourcefulness and yearning for progress and development." 
At the same time he underscored the "ultimate objective (as) 
build(ing) a nation with increased regional and international 
aura, a closely united nation, priding itself on the 
harmonious, indissoluble bonds uniting its Throne and its 
People."  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U)  The king referred to his grandfather, Mohammed V, 
and his father, Hassan II, as "brave martyrs of the 
Resistance," a formula he often uses in speeches.   He called 
on Moroccans to "enhance the free, independent state they 
bequeathed to us, and enrich it with further accomplishments 
and illustrious achievements."  For the king, "ethical values 
include constant uncompromising commitment to principles and 
allegiance to the sacred tenets of the nation, which should 
override any individual interests or personal considerations." 
 
¶3.  (U)  Calling on all citizens to "harness their energies," 
he pointed to the National Initiative for Human Development 
(INDH) as the means by which every citizen will achieve a 
"dignified life."  While sacrifice for "our fathers" meant 
independence, today it means "integrated development."  The 
king stressed that the youth are the nation's energy. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The king's speech commemorating past struggles for 
independence and celebrating youth pointed, as did his Throne 
Day speech (reftels A, B), to the community of citizens that 
will enhance Morocco's future possibilities and improve its 
status.  He firmly re-stated that Morocco's future is in the 
hands of every citizen and that citizens must work together 
to fulfill the goals of sustainable and continuous 
development.  He reaffirmed the links between the people, the 
throne, national unity and territorial integrity.  The 
speech's language is a call for Moroccans to recognize and 
appropriate the past while looking towards the development of 
a positive future.
