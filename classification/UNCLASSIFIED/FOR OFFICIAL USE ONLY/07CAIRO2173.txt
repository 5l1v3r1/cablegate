DIRECTOR GENERAL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 93916 
 
(SBU) Discussing reftel demarche on July 12, Ihab Soliman, 
Director of the MFA's International Organizations Nominations 
Office, told poloffs that Egypt has not yet decided which 
candidate to support for Director General of the 
International Organization for Migration.  Egypt was seeking 
clarity about which of the two American candidates (Swing and 
McKinley) the USG was supporting before coming to a decision. 
 Poloffs explained that the USG strongly backs Ambassador 
Swing, due both to his qualifications and in support of a 
two-term limit for the Director General position.  Poloffs 
advised that McKinley is running under his own auspices. 
Soliman intimated that the Organization of Islamic Countries 
(OIC) may support McKinley's candidacy, but that there was no 
OIC resolution as of yet, reiterating that an Egyptian 
decision has not yet been made.
