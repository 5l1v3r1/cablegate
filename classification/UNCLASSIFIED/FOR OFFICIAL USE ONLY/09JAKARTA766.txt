¶1.  (SBU)  On April 29th, Post informed Halida Miljani, Special 
Assistant to the Minister of International Trade, that Indonesia was 
downgraded on the Special 301 intellectual property rights (IPR) 
Watch List to Priority Watch List status for 2009.  Miljani was not 
surprised and responded that she already warned Minister of Trade 
Pangestu that a downgrade of Indonesia's status was likely. Miljani 
hopes to engage on IPR issues further during the bilateral Trade and 
Investment Framework Agreement talks scheduled in Washington in 
mid-May. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) We conveyed our concerns that Indonesia has made only 
limited improvements overall in the enforcement and protection of 
IPR since its upgrade to the Watch List in November 2006.  We added, 
however, that we are encouraged by some of the corrective steps the 
Indonesian government has initiated in recent weeks.  For example, 
the Ministry of Tourism recently suspended Decree 
PM.55/PW.204/MKP/2008 which required that all theatrical movie 
prints exhibited in Indonesia be processed locally.  Also, Ministry 
of Health officials recently convened an open forum with government 
and industry stakeholders to discuss possible changes to Decree 
1010/MENKES/PER/XI/2008, which requires pharmaceutical companies to 
manufacture drugs domestically as a prerequisite for the licensing 
and sale of their products.  Lastly, GOI officials have expressed a 
renewed willingness to follow-through on codifying Indonesia's 
commitments on data exclusivity in the country's legal framework.
