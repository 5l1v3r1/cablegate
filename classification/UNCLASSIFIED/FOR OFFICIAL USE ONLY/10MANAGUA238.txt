SUMMARY  
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The Nicaraguan Supreme Court administratively closed the 
National Property Appeals Court 
 
on December 20, 2009.  The Supreme Court decided to close the 
appellate body because it was slow, inefficient, and had a backlog 
of casework.  The pending cases were transferred to the Managua 
Civil Appeals Court.  The closing of the court is significant for 
two reasons.  First, there remain 16 pending U.S. citizen cases 
awaiting a hearing.  Second, legal experts complain that the 
Supreme Court did not have the authority to close the court.  They 
also note that the Managua Civil Appeals Court already has a 
backload of cases.  The Supreme Court's action means U.S. citizens 
will continue confronting additional challenges in getting a fair 
hearing in a judicial system that is highly influenced by outside 
political forces. 
 
 
SUPREME COURT CLOSES NATIONAL PROPERTY APPEALS COURT 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2. (U) On December 20, 2009, the Nicaraguan Supreme Court issued an 
administrative order to close the National Property Appeals Court. 
The National Property Appeals Court was the highest appellate body 
for property issues.  The Supreme Court decided to close the 
National Property Appeals Court because it was slow, inefficient, 
and had a backlog of casework.  All cases pending adjudication by 
the National Property Appeals Court were transferred to the Managua 
Civil Appeals Court.  The National Property Appeals Court was 
established by Law 278 (1997) to address property issues resulting 
from actions taken by the first Sandinista Government from 
1979-1990. Specifically, the court dealt with cases that arose from 
the widespread confiscation of private property and the passage of 
Laws 85/1990 and 88/1990, known as the Pi????ata Laws (Ref A), which 
legalized the transfer of ownership of private property to 
occupants who had physical possession of the land but did not have 
title to it. 
 
 
CLOSURE AFFECTS U.S. CASES AND RULE OF LAW 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) The closing of the appellate court negatively affects 16 
U.S. cases awaiting a hearing. 
 
According to Nicaraguan law, the courts hear cases based on the 
date that they were filed in the judicial system and then assigned 
to judges.  Several U.S. claimants have waited more than ten years 
for a court decision.  During the January 28, Property Working 
Group meeting, Government of Nicaragua (GON) officials acknowledged 
that they had no information on how the Supreme Court would 
transfer cases that were in the National Property Appeals Court to 
the Managua Civil Appeals Court, or whether those cases would 
receive priority over other cases that were already registered in 
the civil appellate court. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Another issue concerning the closing of the National 
Property Appeals Court is that it 
appears that the Supreme Court did not have the authority to close 
the appellate body.  Mauro Ampie, an expert on Nicaraguan 
constitutional law, explained that the National Assembly has the 
sole authority to close the court by either amending Law 278 or 
passing a new law to abolish it.  He views the Supreme Court's 
action as a clear violation of the Nicaraguan constitution and 
another setback for the rule of law here (Ref B). 
 
CIVIL COURTS ALREADY BACKLOGGED 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Sergio Corrales, a lawyer who specializes in property 
law, asserted that the closure of 
the National Property Appeals Court will increase the backlog of 
cases in the Managua Civil Appeals Court.  He said that the 
systemic problems in the judicial branch, such as the appointment 
of politically-affiliated, incompetent judges and a lack of funding 
to provide administrative and legal staff for justices, are the 
reasons for the backlog.  He opined that closing the National 
Property Appeals Court further exacerbates the judicial branch's 
difficulty to handle its workload in a timely, professional manner. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The closure of the National Property Appeals Court is the 
latest example of Sandinista  
National Liberation Front judicial activism that usurps the 
constitutional responsibility of another branch of government. The 
Embassy Property Office has advised U.S. claimants who had pending 
cases in the National Property Appeals Court to contact the Supreme 
Court or the Managua Civil Appeals Court to follow up on their 
cases.  Even if the Managua Appeals Court were capable of 
registering their cases and adjudicating them in a timely manner, 
U.S. citizens will continue confronting challenges in seeking a 
fair hearing in a judicial system that is highly influenced by 
outside political forces.
