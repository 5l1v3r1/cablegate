SUBJECT: NAJAF ANNOUNCES INAUGURAL TOURISM CONFERENCE, CALLS FOR 
INTERNATIONAL TOURISM INDUSTRY TO PARTICIPATE 
 
¶1. (U) This is a PRT Najaf Cable. 
 
¶2. (U) Summary. In a February 7 meeting with PRT Najaf, the 
Najaf Provincial Council (PC) Tourism Committee announced that 
it decided to hold the three-day tourism conference April 5 - 7, 
in conjunction with Iraqi Tourism Week, which will begin on 
April 1 with activities in Erbil and Basrah. The Conference will 
include panel discussions of technical issues needed for the 
development of the tourism industry, and a showcasing of Najaf's 
potential tourist attractions. The planners are preparing for 
about three hundred attendees, including hotel and travel 
associations, related businesses, international business persons 
from the travel/tourism industry, and government officials. PRT 
and coalition representatives are welcome to attend. Third 
Infantry Division (3ID) has committed to assisting with security 
for the conference. This is an action cable. See action request 
para seven and eight. End Summary. 
 
¶3. (U) On February 7, the Najaf Tourism Committee, headed by PC 
Tourism Committee Chair Sheikh (and hawza member) Fayid Al 
Shimerti met with the PRT to discuss plans for the PRT-supported 
Najaf Tourism Conference. The Committee selected April 5 - 7 as 
dates for the tourism conference, which will enable the 
conference to dovetail with other events of Iraqi Tourism Week, 
beginning April 1 with events in Basrah and Erbil. The meeting 
also served to introduce the Tourism Committee members to DAI 
(USAID contractor-implementing partner) representatives, Jon 
Weibe and Azzad Saeed, as they will be responsible for 
administering the USD100,000 grant that was approved by the 
Embassy's Technical Evaluation Committee in December. 
 
¶4. (U) The Tourism Committee reported on the work they 
accomplished for the conference, including the creation of five 
sub-committees each with its own budget from the grant. The 
Provincial Government has agreed to contribute USD50,000 to the 
conference to cover expenses for which the QRF grant is not 
authorized, such as security and rental of the conference space. 
 Deliverables for the conference will be the announcement of the 
establishment of a Tourism Information Center in Najaf, as well 
as new Tourism Training courses in conjunction with Kufa 
University. 
 
¶5. (U) DAI's Senior Program Development Officer and PRT Liaison 
Jon Weibe outlined DAI's role in the administration of the IRAP 
grant, explaining that the money would be disbursed in tranches 
through a fixed obligation mechanism. Contact information was 
exchanged so that DAI and the Financial sub-committee for the 
conference planning could continue their cooperative efforts via 
email and telephone communication. The PRT will continue to meet 
regularly with the PC Tourism Committee to monitor progress. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: This conference will be an opportunity to 
showcase Najaf as a tourism destination and a chance for Najaf 
to display itself as an open-minded, welcoming city. The Najaf 
authorities are in the process of reaching out to the wider 
international community, building a new airport, and welcoming 
international participants to this conference. They have 
specifically invited PRT/coalition representatives to take part. 
They have also asked the PRT to help secure participation of 
fifteen to twenty American/international travel/hospitality 
industry participants. They have asked 3ID to help with security 
arrangements at the venue, which will take place at Kufa 
University's auditorium. End Comment. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Action request: 3ID has committed to assisting with 
security for the conference.  To the extent that RSO Hilla 
assets are required to support this activity, PRT requests that 
OPA and RSO Baghdad coordinate that support. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Action request: For FCS Baghdad, Amman, Cairo, Dubai, 
Beirut and Manama: We would welcome your reaching out your 
respective American Chambers of Commerce and relevant business 
contacts in the travel/hospitality/airline industry to inform 
them of this conference. If any company representatives are 
interested in attending they can contact PRT Najaf at email 
kellysh@state.gov.
