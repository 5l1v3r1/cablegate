SUBJECT:  Paktika PEO Details Significant Reduction in Polling 
Stations, PC Fraud, and GIRoA Influence 
 
¶1. SUMMARY.  Paktika PEO Taj Ali told PRT that IEC-Kabul has 
agreed to significantly reduce the number of polling 
stations within the province and will rehire only the most 
capable District Field Coordinators.  It has not, however, 
taken steps to correct lessons learned from August 
regarding the logistical needs of the provincial IEC 
office.  Taj Ali, noting that he expected Provincial 
Council results for Paktika to be announced within the next 
few days, stated that trends of fraud in PC voting mirrored 
that of the presidential election and approached, in his 
opinion, 50 percent.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. In a far-ranging, 75-minute conversation at the PRT, 
Paktika Provincial Election Officer Taj Ali detailed IEC 
planning for the second round of presidential voting. 
Paktika, he said, will see a significant reduction in the 
number of polling centers, polling sites, and District 
Field Coordinator (DFC) positions.  Taj Ali stated that the 
number of polling centers open on November 7 in Paktika 
would only be about 70 percent of those open in August, noting that 
this reduction would cull nearly half of the polling stations in the 
province.  Similarly, the number of District Field Coordinators 
hired for the November runoff would drop by two thirds: only 45 
would be hired compared to 132 in August. Taj Ali said the IEC made 
the decision to close any site that witnessed fraud, was difficult 
to secure, or saw little or no voting in August.  The DFCs, he said, 
would be selected from the "best performers" in August; DFCs at 
centers with fraud will not be rehired.  Responding to PRT Officer's 
concerns regarding the potential disenfranchisement of voters in 
areas that will see station closures, Taj Ali stated that he will 
review the list of sites just received this morning from Kabul to 
ensure sufficient coverage. 
 
¶3. Taj Ali detailed logistical issues that plagued the 
August vote.  He noted issues with GIRoA officials; 
including Sub-Governors, Chiefs of Police, and NDS district 
heads; pressuring DFCs for positions on the employment 
rolls of the local community security forces.  These 
individuals he said, sought to secure a double payment for 
the security they were already providing as GIRoA/ANSF 
officials-adding the 9,000 Afghani sum paid to the 
community forces to their salary.  IEC-Kabul, he said, has 
not taken to heart lessons learned from August in 
supporting the work of PEO's in the field.  Issues related 
to polling station supplies have not been addressed. 
Neither, he said, has IEC committed to issue cell phone SIM 
cards with more minutes to allow IEC officials in the field 
to communicate more regularly with Sharana and Kabul. 
 
¶4. Noting that Paktika's Provincial Council (PC) results 
have not yet been announced, Taj Ali noted that the trends 
of fraud in PC voting mirrored that seen in presidential 
voting.  Using Governor Katawazay's candidate uncle as 
an example, Taj Ali said that there were instances of 
polling stations tabulating exactly 600 votes for President 
Karzai and 600 votes for the Governor's uncle-with not a 
single vote cast for another candidate in either race.  Taj 
Ali speculated that fraud in PC voting may have been as 
high as 50 percent.  Results, he said, should be announced 
within the next week. 
 
¶5. Comment: Taj Ali is a valued contact of PRT Paktika who appears 
to be service-oriented and performs his job competently.  His 
communications with the PRT do not seem motivated by politics.  End 
Comment.
