 ¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  As of midday local time April 30, no 
cases of the H1N1 virus have been detected in Taiwan. Taiwan 
health officials believe they are well-prepared to meet the 
latest challenges posed by the H1N1 virus.  Airports have 
beefed up thermal screening of incoming passengers, and the 
authorities have set up command centers at 25 sites to 
monitor any outbreaks of the flu.  In the last week, the 
Taiwan authorities have gradually ratcheted up their public 
health preparations in response to the virus.  Suspected 
cases of H1N1 have so far tested negative for the virus.  The 
Foreign Ministry has effectively banned organized tour groups 
from traveling to Mexico. Health authorities are quickly 
taking stock of anti-viral vaccines, masks and hospitals that 
might be turned into treatment centers in the event of an 
outbreak. The Taiwan Center for Disease Control (TCDC) has 
requested a sample H1N1 virus from US CDC. END SUMMARY. 
 
TAIWAN PREPARES TO DEAL WITH H1N1 VIRUS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  After the WHO issued a pandemic alert on the H1N1 
virus, Taiwan authorities took immediate action to counter 
the spread of the virus.  On April 27, Minister of Health Yeh 
Ching-chuan announced that the H1N1 virus has been designated 
as a category A infectious disease, meaning that all cases 
must be reported within 24 hours, and that H1N1 cases must be 
quarantined and treated.  Yeh took over the command and 
control of the anti-virus effort by setting up 24-hour 
monitoring at the Center for Disease Control Command Center. 
On April 28, Yeh strengthened airport monitoring by securing 
the cooperation of incoming air carriers to allow CDC 
personnel to board incoming flights from countries where the 
H1N1 virus has been confirmed.  Once aboard the planes, CDC 
staff check passengers with fevers before allowing them to 
deplane.  Anyone with a fever will be questioned, and if 
traveling from a place where the H1N1 virus has been found, 
will be referred for medical testing.  Health authorities 
report that Taiwan's three pharmaceutical companies are 
capable of producing 500,000 doses of Tamiflu on a priority 
basis. 
 
 
ATTENDING IHR TECHNICAL AND EXPERT MEETINGS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  TCDC Deputy Director Shih Wen-yi told us Taiwan's 
new WHA observer status has limited bearing on its ability to 
combat the H1N1 virus.  He said Taiwan relies heavily on 
International Health Regulations (IHR) updates, and 
highlights the importance of Taiwan's participation in 
IHR-sponsored technical and expert meetings to get a better 
understanding of the virus and strategies to combat its 
spread.  Shih said Taiwan still gets late notice of IHR 
meetings, leaving it little room for participation.  Shih 
said the Taiwan-administered islands of Kinmen and Matsu, 
which have transportation "minilinks" with the PRC, have 
already taken steps to check incoming passengers from the 
Mainland.  According to Shih, TCDC has thus far not contacted 
its PRC counterparts regarding H1N1 virus issues. 
 
 
TCDC SEEKS H1N1 VIRUS SAMPLE 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  On Aril 28, TCDC asked for AIT help in procuring a 
sample of the H1N1 virus to enable Taiwan prepare vaccine 
production locally.  In response, AIT has put TCDC in contact 
with Bangkok's U.S. CDC office.  TCDC has also contacted CDC 
Atlanta and requested a virus sample.  On antivirus supplies, 
TCDC told us they have 3 million N95 masks, 11 million 
surgical masks, 1.54 million sets of protective clothing, 
1.59 million doses of Tamiflu, and 0.69 million doses of 
Relenza. 
 
SWINE FLU SUSPECTS TEST NEGATIVE 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  To date, all 13 of Taiwan's suspected cases of flu 
virus have tested negative for H1N1.  On April 27, a 
suspected case of swine flu of an individual who had traveled 
to Mexico was detected with a fever and underwent tests at a 
 
TAIPEI 00000515  002 OF 002 
 
 
designated hospital, but tested negative for the H1N1 virus. 
On April 29, three passengers from a flight originating in 
San Francisco showed fever signs, but tested negative to the 
H1N1 virus.  Airline onboard quarantine fever checks started 
on April 29, and are slated to continue as long as the H1N1 
virus continues to be a threat.  From April 28 to 30, about 
15,000 arriving passengers have been monitored from a total 
of roughly 50 flights.  On April 30, nine incoming passengers 
were found with fevers, but all have tested negative for 
H1N1.  TCDC told us that it takes six hours to complete the 
testing. Those who test positive for the virus will be 
quarantined in a designated hospital. 
 
TRAVEL ALERTS 
------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Taiwan travel agency-organized tours to Mexico have 
been officially banned, and violators will be subject to 
fines. Travel alerts have been issued for Mexico, Texas, and 
California.  Organized travel tours and individual trips are 
still permitted to Texas and California, but the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs has recommended against unnecessary trips to 
Mexico by individuals.
