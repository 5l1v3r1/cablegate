SUBJECT:  HAROUN SPEAKS OUT ON THE ICC AND DARFUR 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a interview which appeared in the September 15 edition 
of independent Sudanese daily Al-Rai Al-Aam's special political 
supplement, war crimes suspect and State Minister for Humanitarian 
Affairs Ahmad Haroun lashed out at the International Criminal Court, 
calling his indictment a cynical and politically-motivated attempt 
to target the Sudanese government. ICC chief prosecutor Luis 
Moreno-Ocampo acted on the orders of Britain, the US and France, he 
claimed. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Saying that he was "free to travel," Haroun downplayed the 
effects of the ICC arrest warrant. Moreno-Ocampo was not prosecutor 
general for the entire world, he said, and the legitimacy of the ICC 
itself was suspect. If asked to travel in his ministerial capacity, 
Haroun said he would take into consideration the nature of the 
travel and whether it would benefit Sudan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) While admitting that there was a "problem" in Darfur, 
Haroun told Al-Rai Al-Aam that the time was not right to address the 
issue. As in the south, there should first be a cessation of 
hostilities, discussion of security arrangements and then movement 
towards a political process which would also address issues of 
accountability. Exactly the opposite was taking place in Darfur, 
with indictments and sanctions taking precedence over political 
negotiations. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Haroun also told the newspaper that the Sudanese government 
rejected any dealings with the ICC. He had no special immunities 
because he was a minister, he asserted. Fellow indictee and alleged 
janjaweed leader Ali Kushayb had no ministerial protections, but 
would not be extradited either. Ending his interview on a somewhat 
gleeful note, Haroun said that while UNSCR 1706 was tantamount to 
establishing an occupation force in Darfur, UNSCR 1769 represented a 
victory for the Sudanese government. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: In a rather ironic turn of events, the Sudanese 
government announced last week the creation of national committee to 
investigate human rights complaints -co-chaired by Ahmad Haroun. 
According to Anne Itto, the SPLM co-chair and senior party member, 
the role was approved by both the NCP and the SPLM. Sudanese human 
rights activists have denounced his appointment, accusing the 
government of blatantly thumbing its nose at the ICC. Whether this 
represents an act of defiance, a grievous lapse of judgment or part 
of the usual internal struggle for power, it certainly does not bode 
well for the government's nascent efforts to confront human rights 
abuses in the country. End comment.
