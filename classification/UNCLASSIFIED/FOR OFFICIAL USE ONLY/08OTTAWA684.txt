SUBJECT: PARLIAMENTARIANS HIGHLIGHT BORDER CONCERNS 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: In advance of the annual Canada-U.S. 
Inter-Parliamentary meeting May 17-18, Canadian MPs and 
Senators expressed concern to Ambassador over the "thickening 
of the border" and hope that Congress may again push back the 
June 2009 date for implementation of WHTI on the land border. 
 They raised concerns over contraband tobacco, water exports, 
Devils Lake, uranium production, the DRIC project, and 
information-sharing in the wake of recent revelations in the 
Abdullah Khadr extradition case.  End Summary 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador, accompanied by DCM, PolMinCouns, RSO, 
DHS Attache, and poloff, met on May 14 with thirteen Canadian 
Senators and Members of Parliament -- representing all four 
parties -- in advance of their travel as the Canada-U.S. 
Inter-Parliamentary Group (IPG) to Santa Fe for their annual 
meeting with U.S. Congresspersons and Senators. 
 
BORDER, WHTI, AND DRIC 
---------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The border and implementation of the Western 
Hemisphere Travel Initiative were the most prominent issues. 
IPG co-chair Senator Jerry Grafstein (Liberal, Ontario) 
expressed concern that the border is getting slower in both 
directions, and said that there are increasingly long lines 
at the Toronto Airport's pre-clearance facility.  He stressed 
the need to focus more on planning for manpower and 
modernization of the border infrastructure.  IPG co-chair MP 
Rob Merrifield (Conservative, Alberta) expressed concern that 
the infrastructure and personnel would not be in place for 
the final implementation of the land requirement for WHTI in 
June 2009, and suggested that it would be in both countries' 
interest to push it back yet again. He said that Canada wants 
the border to be "fluid" and, if recent experience is any 
indication, the final implementation will lead to long 
slowdowns and economic disruptions. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Brian Masse (NDP, Ontario) raised the issue of 
drivers getting pulled over after going through the border, 
and noted that NEXUS lanes are not always open to full 
capacity.  Jeff Watson (Conservative, Ontario) expressed 
concern with the Detroit River International Crossing (DRIC) 
project at Detroit-Windsor and the long-term issue with 
infrastructure there.  He added that he would like to get 
help with Canadians who cannot travel to the U.S. because of 
previous criminal convictions, even though the crimes 
occurred as long as 3-4 decades ago.  Every MP has a number 
of these cases, he said, and it would be helpful to implement 
a system whereby they could be cleared for travel purposes. 
Merrifield emphasized that, of the nine resolutions in the 
last IPG meeting, the most difficult was land pre-clearance, 
something the Canadian delegation would raise again this year. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Ambassador pointed out that the U.S. is far ahead of 
Canada at present in making enhanced drivers licenses 
available for U.S. citizens, and that, while a lower 
percentage of Americans may have passports than Canadians, a 
larger percentage of Americans who need to cross the border 
have a passport.  He noted that our staffing and 
infrastructure are adequate to meet the demand for passport 
issuance in the future.  He and DCM suggested that the NEXUS 
Qissuance in the future.  He and DCM suggested that the NEXUS 
program is underutilized at present and that both sides need 
to do more to push the program in order to make the NEXUS 
lanes more productive.  DHS Attache added that there are a 
number of additional initiatives planned and underway, 
including more enrollment centers, that will make the program 
more productive, and noted that the Canadian Border Services 
Agency had not committed to staffing the new centers.  DHS 
Attache also noted that U.S. immigration law does not have a 
"statue of limitations" on previous criminal convictions that 
render one admissible; in all cases, applicants must request 
a waiver.  (Comment:  Canada's immigration law is similar in 
that respect.  End comment)  She commented that increased 
identify verification at ports and the sharing of databases 
are likely the main reasons for increases in admissibilities 
(in both directions). 
 
ENERGY, CIGARETTE SMUGGLING, BULK WATER, AND URANIUM 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Canadian parliamentarians said a number of other 
issues would be on the table in Santa Fe. 
 
 
OTTAWA 00000684  002 OF 002 
 
 
-- Shawn Murphy (Liberal, Prince Edward Island) asked about 
the Farm Bill and suggested that coordination of agricultural 
policy would be useful. 
-- Lloyd St. Amand (Liberal, Ontario) complained about 
contraband tobacco, which he said now makes up 60% of tobacco 
consumed in Canada, 90% of which is manufactured in the 
United States, most of it on New York State First Nations 
reservations.  Bloc MP Paul Crete seconded this concern and 
asked if we could do more to stop the flow. 
-- Joe Commuzzi (Conservative, Ontario) said that for years 
Canada had been slow to "link" energy to any other issues but 
the PM had begun to do so, notably at the press conference in 
New Orleans with President Bush.  He said parliamentarians 
will take the issue of energy to the IPG and promote the 
importance of the energy relationship to their American 
counterparts. 
-- Commuzzi also expressed concern over bulk water exports 
and asked if the current arrangement on Devils Lake is being 
followed and whether everything is in place to avoid the risk 
of "putting bad water into good." 
-- Brad Trost (Conservative, Saskatchewan) asked how U.S. 
policy was developing on the issue of allowing Canada to 
enrich uranium, a key issue for his riding.  He was also 
focused on the energy issue and how to best cooperate on 
energy security. 
-- Senator Frank Mahlovich (Liberal, Ontario) raised the 
recent revelations that the U.S. had paid a "bounty" for the 
capture of Abdullah Khadr.  He expressed concern that, since 
Canada depends on the U.S. for so much of its intelligence, 
this might harm information-sharing. 
-- Several MPs and Senators asked for our assessment of the 
"true state" of NAFTA in light of recent negative campaign 
rhetoric. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment: The issues raised in this meeting are 
illustrative, not comprehensive, but are a useful snapshot of 
how some key Canadian MPs and Senators view the U.S. - Canada 
relationship.  For all, relations with the U.S. are an 
important issue, and they clearly want to work to keep our 
relationship strong.  But on WHTI, the clear message from 
this  group was that they would still like to soften and 
delay U.S. implementation rather than speed up and stiffen 
Canadian compliance, and they expect a new American Congress 
might be willing to do so.
