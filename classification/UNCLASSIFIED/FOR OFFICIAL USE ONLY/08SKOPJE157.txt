SUBJECT: MACEDONIA COMMITTED SUPPORTING ISAF 
 
REF: SECSTATE 19516 
 
(SBU) The Government of Macedonia (GOM) is committed to 
supporting NATO's ISAF mission in Afghanistan.  Macedonia has 
pledged to send an Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team 
(OMLT) to Afghanistan, and recently doubled its ISAF 
deployments to over 130 troops.  The Macedonian company 
currently providing ISAF HQs protection also includes a UK 
platoon under its command, a reflection of the high regard 
other Allies have for Macedonian troops and their leaders. 
In addition to its increased contributions in Afghanistan, 
Macedonia recently doubled its troop commitments to Iraq, 
adding another Special Forces platoon to operations there in 
response to a direct USG request.  These generous commitments 
place Macedonia at the upper limit of its current 
contributing capacity, although the government is planning to 
increase its overseas troop commitments in the future, with a 
full battalion prepared for deployment by 2010.  As PM 
Gruevski recently assured a visiting U.S. House NATO 
Parliamentary Delegation visiting Skopje, "Macedonia can be 
counted on for current and future missions" such as ISAF in 
Afghanistan.
