SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff and FAA senior representative discussed reftel 
demarches June 28 with Jean-Michel Bour, head of the Office of 
International Affairs at the French Civil Aviation authority. 
Though key advisors on aviation and environment have not yet been 
officially appointed in the recently reorganized ministry of Ecology 
and Sustainable Development, we also provided the demarches to 
Michel Fremont, Chief of Staff to Minister Jean-Louis Borloo, and to 
Michel Wachenheim, who is expected to be named as the principal 
advisor to State Minister for Transportation Dominique Bussereau.

¶2. (SBU) On U.S. positions regarding the Universal Safety Oversight 
Program (USOAP), and other positions on Safety Enhancement and 
Oversight, Bour said that he saw no major incompatibilities with 
French views.  He was open to the possibility of co-sponsorship of a 
paper on USOAP, but thought that a regional approach would make more 
sense, and recommended that we approach ECAC about this.  U.S. 
support for European papers, most of which had been completed and 
were being distributed by ECAC, would be a logical complement to 
this request he said.  One area where France had reservations about 
U.S. views was on the publication of security audit information. 
France was "very, very reticent" about exchange of such information, 
he said. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  On reform more generally, a special meeting of ECAC in 
late August would adopt a common European position on reform of the 
Chicago Convention.  Bour also noted that France agreed on the need 
for greater efficiency within ICAO, but felt that clear and detailed 
proposals were still lacking, for example on increased oversight in 
Africa.  In what he characterized as a useful initiative, he said 
that ICAO President Kobeh planned to call a Ministerial on the eve 
of the General Assembly to help build political will for change. 
Minister of State for Transport Bussereau had been invited.

¶4. (SBU)  As he has in past conversations, Bour made clear that he 
hoped the ICAO assembly would prove a step on the way to integrating 
aviation emissions into a post-Kyoto system.  The EU's ETS system 
was already in motion, and would eventually have to include foreign 
airlines and international flights to maintain competitive balance. 
He rejected our view that this could only occur on the basis of 
"mutual agreement."  He was intrigued however by the idea that some 
kind of recognized "equivalence" with systems that other regions 
might adopt independently could provide a way around this dilemma. 
If ICAO set broad objectives and defined the criteria for 
equivalence, other regions would be free to adopt their own regimes 
(as Australia was proposing to do).  The EU could then recognize 
other regimes as equivalent to its own.  How this would solve the 
practical issue of foreign airlines and international flights being 
subject to ETS, or respond to our objections that such a requirement 
is contrary to international law, was unclear from his response.
