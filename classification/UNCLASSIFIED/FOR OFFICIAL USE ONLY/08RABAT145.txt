REF: SECSTATE 12905 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Econ Counselor delivered reftel points jointly with 
the EU's Economic Counselor in Morocco Jerome Cassier  in a 
February 15 meeting with Mohammed Benjelloun, head of the WTO 
Division at the Ministry of External Commerce.  Benjelloun 
declined to provide an official response pending 
inter-ministerial coordination on the issue.  He said, 
however, that in principle Morocco is supportive of any 
measure that reduces non-tariff barriers to trade and that 
increases the "transparency" of labelling and other 
requirements.  He committed to gather his colleagues from 
other concerned Ministries to review the proposal in detail 
and to provide us with an answer as quickly as possible.
