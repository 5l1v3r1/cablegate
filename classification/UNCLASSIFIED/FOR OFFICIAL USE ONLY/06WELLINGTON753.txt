SUBJECT: ROGUE NATIONAL MP IS SHOWN THE DOOR AFTER CAUCUS VOTE 
¶1. (SBU) The leader of the National Party, Dr. Don Brash, has 
shocked the political establishment by announcing that outspoken 
National MP Brian Connell has been suspended from National's caucus 
 
after a secret ballot. At a caucus meeting two weeks ago, Connell 
challenged Brash over his alleged affair with a businesswoman - a 
confrontation which was leaked to the media. Connell is suspected 
being the source of the leak, which he denies. Although Brash said 
that there is no evidence to prove that Connell was the leak, his 
public comments after that caucus meeting confrontation was the 
final straw after years of "destructive behavior" (Connell often 
publicly criticized Brash and his policies). 
¶2. (SBU) A former National Minister who represented Connell's 
constituency has told post that National supporters there have had 
enough of Connell and his badmouthing of the party. Suspension from 
caucus is a serious step to be taken against an MP. Connell can no 
longer be assigned any tasks by the party whips, and will be out in 
the cold in Parliament.  Brash said he believed he could rely on 
Connell's vote in Parliament. Yet, given the number of differences 
Connell has had with his leader, his vote cannot be guaranteed. 
¶3. (SBU) Connell said he was shocked by the move and apparently 
received no prior warning. He would not comment on his political 
future. He did say that he was not considering quitting Parliament 
and forcing a by-election in his South Island country electorate or 
leaving the National Party (he remains a National MP and could 
conceivably return to caucus) to become an independent. He does, 
however, refuse to rule anything out. At a time when Labour is on 
the ropes in the polls and in Parliament, it will welcome this 
problem for National with opened arms. Expect Labour to dine out on 
it as the media focus moves from it to National - for the time 
being.
