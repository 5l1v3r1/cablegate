SUBJECT: GAZA HUMANITARIAN UPDATE -- JANUARY 2 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: OCHA estimates that a maximum of 70 truckloads of 
supplies would enter Gaza via Kerem Shalom on January 2.  Karni and 
Nahal Oz crossings remained closed, and the GOI did not permit entry 
of diesel through Kerem Shalom.  Gaza City has been entirely without 
running water for three days, and contacts estimate hundreds of 
thousands of people are without clean water, electricity or heat. 
End Summary. 
 
Crossings 
--------- 
¶2. (SBU) OCHA contacts report that approximately 70 truckloads are 
expected to enter Gaza through Kerem Shalom.  UNRWA reports 57 
trucks entered Kerem Shalom on January 1, including 30 for aid 
organizations.  A small number of patients and hundreds of foreign 
passport holders including 16 American citizens and 11 of their 
non-Amcit family members were evacuated through Erez January 2. 
Approximately 30 wounded were evacuated through Rafah on January 1, 
and two truckloads of medical supplies entered Rafah on January 2. 
Karni and Nahal Oz crossings remained closed. 
 
Critical Fuel and Water Shortages: 
---------------------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) UNRWA reports that COGAT refused entry of five tankers of 
industrial diesel (237,000 liters) through Kerem Shalom for the Gaza 
power plant.  UNRWA expects Kerem Shalom will remain closed for 
Shabbat, and that Sunday is the next opportunity for the entry of 
diesel, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without electricity, 
water, or heat.  Gaza City has been entirely without running water 
for three days, and cooking gas is still urgently needed, according 
to local contacts. 
 
4.(SBU) Telecom company Paltel warned ConGenOffs that if it cannot 
move fuel from its reserves in Gaza to its generators, 80,000 phone 
lines and the use of emergency numbers will shut down in 48 hours. 
Paltel's reserve stations are located near potential targets, 
including a police station and the Hamas "Ministry of 
Telecommunications."  (Note: three Paltel employees were killed in 
an IDF strike while at work December 27.  End note.)  Paltel asked 
ICRC for urgent assistance in coordinating movement of its fuel 
truck with the IDF.  Separately, the CEO of Jawwal cellular told 
Econ Specialist that only 40 of 100 cell phone stations in Gaza are 
currently operational due to electricity shortages. 
 
Food 
---- 
¶5. (SBU) WFP delivered food assistance to 35,000 people on January 1 
and provided 5,500 patients in hospitals with biscuits and canned 
meat, and 15,000 people in Beit Hanoun with bread.  UNRWA 
distributed food assistance to 7,200 people on January 1, and a 
similar number on January 2.  Both UNRWA and WFP are coordinating 
locations and timing for distributions with COGAT.  According to the 
Gaza Federation of Industries, the average wait-time in bread lines 
is three hours. 
 
Medical Update 
-------------- 
¶6. (SBU) OCHA reports that at least 1,200 wounded remained 
hospitalized as of January 1.  Gaza hospitals remain overwhelmed and 
are discharging patients as soon as possible to free beds for new 
casualties.  A USG panel physician in Gaza City reports that the 
quantity of traumatic emergencies in hospitals has limited the 
resources available for treating chronic diseases and non-traumatic 
emergencies such as heart attacks.   OCHA reports that the supply of 
medicine has been somewhat stabilized, but the shortage of medical 
equipment and spare parts remains a major challenge.
