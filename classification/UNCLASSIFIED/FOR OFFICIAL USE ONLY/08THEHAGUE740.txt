EXPANSION 
 
REF: STATE 93225 
 
The Dutch generally support the proposed expansion of the 
Afghan National Army, but they are looking for more details. 
Poloff delivered reftel points on September 2 to the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs Coordinator for Task Force Uruzgan and to 
the Ministry of Defense (MOD) Senior Policy Advisor.  Both 
contacts generally supported the concept.  However, prior to 
any formal stance, the Dutch would like to have more details 
on the proposed funding streams for training, supplying and 
sustainment; the types of units proposed; and the timeline 
for the decision process. (Comment:  This is typical, 
deliberate decision-making in The Hague.  In recent meetings 
with Ambassador Culbertson the Dutch leadership has expressed 
continued strong support for the overall mission in 
Afghanistan.  End comment.)
