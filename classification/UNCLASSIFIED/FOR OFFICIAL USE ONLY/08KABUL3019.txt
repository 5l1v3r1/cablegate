REF: KABUL 2977 
 
¶1. (SBU) The difficulties in airlifting Afghan Haj pilgrims to Saudi 
Arabia that led to the dismissal of the last Transport Minister 
(reftel) are continuing.  More than a week after Haj flights were to 
have begun, only about 900 of the 30,000 Afghans who have paid to 
make the Haj have actually taken flights to Saudi Arabia.  The few 
flights that have occurred have been wet-lease contracts arranged by 
the state-owned Afghan carrier Ariana Airlines with a Turkish 
carrier.  But since Ariana is officially banned by Saudi authorities 
from flying to Saudi Arabia, it is unclear if even these wet-lease 
flights can continue. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Afghan government has signed a new contract with a 
Saudi-Swiss charter carrier, but this airline has not been able to 
provide the promised number of flights, in part because of higher 
insurance costs and complicated underwriting standards associated 
with flights to Afghanistan.  Some of the flights the Saudi-Swiss 
contractor are to provide would be sub-contracted to a second 
Turkish charter carrier, but its flights have been delayed 
reportedly because of issues related to the Turkish civil aviation 
authority.  FM Spanta had to step away from a meeting today with the 
Ambassador to address the issue.  Embassies Kabul and Warsaw 
subsequently assisted Spanta and the MFA to place a call to Turkish 
FM Babacan, who was in Warsaw.  Kabul's FAA Rep also continues to 
provide direct assistance to the Ministry of Transport and Civil 
Aviation in resolving technical issues.  AmConsul Jeddah has also 
helped resolve issues with landing slots on the Saudi end. 
Commercial issues between the Afghan government and its contractors 
present higher hurdles, and the USG has limited ability to influence 
these. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Meanwhile, thousands of would-be Hajis day after day await 
news of when they will fly.  Hundreds have been told to gather at a 
mosque in downtown Kabul in preparation for departure.  They wait in 
reportedly squalid conditions and are becoming angrier each day that 
the promised Haj flights do not occur.  Demonstrations against the 
government's handling of the Haj flights have already taken place, 
and the possibility of further social unrest cannot be ruled out.
