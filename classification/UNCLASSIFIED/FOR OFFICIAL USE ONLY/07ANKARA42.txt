THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary and Action Request: In an introductory meeting 
with THE state-owned Turkish Coal Enterprises (TKI), Director 
Selahaddin Anac expressed hope for activity under the bilateral 
Implementing Arrangement for Cooperation in the Field of Coal and 
Power Systems.  He voiced strong interest in launching some sort of 
cooperation in advance of the expiration of the agreement on March 
20, 2007, and/or extending the agreement by mutual agreement as 
provided for in the agreement.  Reftel asked for status of DOE 
proposed workshops under the two bilateral agreements in place. 
Post would appreciate Washington's guidance.  End Summary and Action 
Request. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In June 2006, the GOT formally asked the USG the status 
of the two bilateral workshops proposed early in 2006 by USDOE (Ref 
A cable transmission of its diplomatic note).  The two proposed 
workshops were: 1) Environmental Technologies and Clean Coal 
Technology, and 2) Energy Efficient and Earthquake Resistant 
Housing.  The GOT Energy Ministry and related agencies expressed a 
particular interest in the first workshop that was proposed by USDOE 
Fossil Energy.  The two workshops would represent activity under the 
above coal agreement and a sister agreement: Implementing 
Arrangement for Cooperation in Energy Technology, also expiring 
March 20, 2007. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The Coal Agreement envisions exchange of information and 
visits on clean coal technology, environmental control technologies, 
advanced power systems and combustion technologies, environmental 
monitoring technologies, and distributed power applications of fuel 
cells, among other areas and activities.  The TKI team said their 
company was active in the IEA Coal Industry Advisory Board and 
relevant UN and EU organizations.  While much of their research and 
work was focused on and financed by the EU, they placed great 
importance on learning from U.S. research and experiences. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  We asked whether TKI would be interested in participating 
in a videoconference with U.S. and Turkish experts on clean coal 
technology.  While giving the idea merit, they expressed misgivings 
about a videoconference as an effective forum especially given 
translation requirements.  They preferred pursuing exchange visits 
or workshops that would bring experts physically together. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Speaking good English, TKI Director Anac said he studied 
in the UK.  He showed a copy of the 2002 agreement signed by former 
Energy Secretary Abraham.  His team spoke limited English, but they 
shared enthusiasm for establishing meaningful cooperation with the 
U.S.
