¶1. (SBU) Below is a list of 53 suspected militants provided 
to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) from the Armed 
Forces of the Philippines (AFP) (a copy has been faxed to 
EAP/PMBS).  MILF officials have publicly stated they are in 
the process of "validating" the list, and the names will form 
the foundation of jointly executed investigations and arrests 
using the GRP-MILF Ad Hoc Joint Action Group (AHJAG) (ref A). 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) An MILF AHJAG official privately stressed to poloff 
that Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) and Pentagon Gang suspects can be 
arrested easily.  He noted, however, that Jemmah Islamiyah 
(JI) personalities are "difficult to locate" because they 
operate in isolated areas and are suspicious of outsiders. 
The AHJAG official requested pictures of the JI suspects on 
the list.  In response we have offered to brief the AHJAG on 
the Department's Rewards For Justice and DoD Rewards 
Programs.  On an upcoming trip to Cotabato City, Acting DCM 
and accompanying US military officers will offer briefings on 
the rewards programs to city Mayor Muslimin Sema, the local 
Sixth Infantry Division Commander, and the Malaysian-led 
International (Ceasefire) Monitoring Team.
