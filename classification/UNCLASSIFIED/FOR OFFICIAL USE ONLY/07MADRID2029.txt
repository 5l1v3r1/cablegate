     ¶C. 10/19 U/S DOBRIANSKY LETTER TO AMB. AGUIRRE 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Per refs, Ambassador Aguirre discussed GOS action 
on the official status of certain religions with Foreign 
Minister Moratinos on October 24.  Ambassador Aguirre 
stressed that it was important to the USG and the U.S. Senate 
that the GOS provide equal treatment for all religions with 
"notorio arraigo" status. He said the issue was one of basic 
religious freedom, and he asked for Moratinos' assurance that 
the GOS would address the issue.  The Ambassador also noted 
that U/S Dobriansky had called Ambassador Westendorp into the 
Department to discuss the issue. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Moratinos apologized for being unavailable 
previously due to his recent trip to Lebanon, and he said he 
understood and appreciated the importance of the issue to the 
USG.  Moratinos said he had not received a report from 
Ambassador Westendorp and allowed that he was not very 
familiar with the details of the issue.  He noted that the 
MOJ has the lead, and he promised to call Justice Minister 
Bermejo to relay U.S. concerns.  Moratinos said he would 
direct his Special Ambassador for Religious Freedom to follow 
up with the Justice Ministry and to get an answer for 
Moratinos.  The Ambassador thanked Moratinos and noted the 
issue might be on the agenda at the early November meeting 
between Moratinos and Secretary Rice. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  In Moratinos' absence, the Ambassador had 
previously spoken with Deputy FM Bernardino Leon on October 
¶22.  Leon had relayed much the same message, that the 
Ministry of Justice has the lead on religious matters but 
that the MFA would closely follow the development of the 
issue and keep the USG informed. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  COMMENT:  Post will continue to work this issue 
with the Ministry of Justice and with the MFA, including at 
an upcoming meeting between the DCM and the Deputy Minister 
of Justice.  END COMMENT. 
AGUIRRE
