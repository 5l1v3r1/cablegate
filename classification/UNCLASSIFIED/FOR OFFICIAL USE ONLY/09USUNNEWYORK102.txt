SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST: DRAFT SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 6467 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST.  Per Reftel 
instructions, Ambassador Rice along with Ambassadors of 
Croatia, France, Germany, and Russia ("Group of Friends") 
have achieved "ad referendum" agreement on the text of a 
Security Council resolution that would extend the mandate of 
the UN mission for four months, but includes additional 
elements suggested by France.  During consultations of the 
whole on February 9, Ambassador Rice along with French and 
U.K. Ambassadors successfully warded off an attempt by the 
Russian federation to change the name of the agenda item for 
consultations on Tuesday February 10 from "Situation in 
Georgia" to "UNSCR 1839".  ACTION REQUEST: USUN requests 
Department approval by 11:00 on Tuesday February 10 on the 
resolution text contained in paragraph 5, as the Group of 
Friends wish to circulate it informally to the full Council. 
END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassadors Rice and DiCarlo reached "ad referendum" 
agreement with Ambassadors of the Group of Friends on 
February 9 on the text of a Security Council resolution that 
would roll over the current UNOMIG mandate for four months, 
with a June 15 expiration date.  Per reftel instructions, the 
draft resolution refers to Resolution 1808, which by 
reference reaffirms the commitment of member state to the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.  The 
resolution calls for provision 2(a) of the former Moscow 
Agreement to be respected, pending agreement on a revised 
security regime and calls for the intensification of efforts 
to address security and stability issues and the return of 
IDPs through the Geneva discussions. The resolution expresses 
the intention of the Security Council to outline elements of 
a future presence by the mandate's June 15 expiration, taking 
into account the Secretary-General's recommendations, the 
Geneva discussions, and the situation on the ground. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In Security Council Consultations on February 9, 
Ambassador Rice, along with U.K. and French Ambassadors, 
deflected an attempt by the Russian Federation to have the 
agenda item for consultations on Tuesday February 10 changed, 
from the "Situation in Georgia" to UNSCR 1839. Japanese 
PermRep Takasu had raised the issue at the request of the 
Russian Federation.  Ambassador Rice pointed out that a 
decision of the Council (i.e., 9 votes for a procedural 
decision) would be necessary to change the agenda item, that 
the U.S. would be opposed, and that we believed a decision by 
the Council to change the name of the agenda item would give 
an unintended signal on the Council's commitment to Georgia's 
sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Russian Ambassador 
Vitaly Churkin did not pursue the issue, and it was dropped. 
Tuesday's agenda has subsequently been published, and reads, 
"The Situation in Georgia." 
 
¶4. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  USUN requests Department 
concurrence by 11:00 A.M. on Tuesday February 10 to 
informally circulate to the full Council the draft text in 
paragraph 5. 
 
¶5. (SBU) BEGIN TEXT:
