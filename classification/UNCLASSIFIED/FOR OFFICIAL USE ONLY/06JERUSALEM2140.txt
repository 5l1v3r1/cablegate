¶1.  (SBU) In a May 24 meeting, World Food Programme (WFP) 
Deputy Country Director Jacques Higgins and West Bank Program 
Officer Claire Conan briefed USAID Health and Humanitarian 
Services Officer and EconOff on concerns about deteriorating 
food security in the West Bank and Gaza.  Although WFP's 
analysis of recently collected food security data is still in 
progress, WFP fears that a growing number of Palestinian 
families are unable to meet their nutrition needs.  Possible 
contributing factors include non-payment of PA salaries and 
closures of crossings, combined with a decrease in protein 
sources due to Avian Influenza (AI) and Gaza coastline 
fishing restrictions. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Higgins said that WFP is conducting a nutritional 
data assessment to monitor levels of micronutrient 
deficiencies and acute malnutrition rates.  Current data will 
be compared with the WFP 2004 baseline survey.  If acute 
malnutrition rates do begin to rise, WFP will respond by 
adding supplemental and/or therapeutic feeding programs for 
children to its food assistance activities through NGO 
partners. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Higgins said WFP expects to increase its caseload 
by 25 percent, reaching 600,000 beneficiaries.  He said WFP's 
2006 budget had been revised from USD 40 million to USD 52 
million, an increase which will be reflected in the 
Consolidated Appeal by UN agencies for emergency support on 
May 31.  Higgins said the USD 12 million increase has two 
main components: USD 2 million for fighting the spread of 
Avian Influenza (AI), and USD 10 million to increase WFP's 
capacity to manage a 25 percent caseload increase.  He added 
that WFP was already looking for additional partners to 
expand its operations.
