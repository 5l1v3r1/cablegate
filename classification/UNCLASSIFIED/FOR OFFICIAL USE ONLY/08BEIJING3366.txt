¶1. (SBU) Summary.  The Chinese Government has confirmed that 
a major Chinese state-owned oil company has agreed to a 
contract to develop an oil field southeast of Baghdad.  The 
exact details of the as-yet-unfinalized agreement are 
unclear, but appear to involve a fee-for-service arrangement, 
with no guaranteed share of future production.  Some analysts 
criticized the Chinese for accepting less-profitable terms in 
order to improve their chance of future access to Iraqi oil 
fields.  Neither Chinese government nor Iraqi embassy 
contacts would comment on the deal. End Summary. 
 
An "Agreement" in Beijing 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) regularly 
scheduled press briefing, spokesperson Qin Gang confirmed 
that the China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) had reached 
an "agreement" with Iraq's central government to develop the 
al-Ahdab oil field southeast of Baghdad (see ref A).  Western 
press reported that the deal will be worth US$3 billion. 
 
¶3. (U) According to press reports, the agreement is a 
renegotiation of a 1997 production-sharing contract with 
CNPC.  Under the new deal, CNPC reportedly agreed to a 
fee-for-service arrangement.  Iraqi Oil Minister Hussain 
al-Shahristani said that under the revised contract the 
al-Ahdab oil field will produce 110,000 barrels per day and 
should pump for 20 years.  The Chinese company will form a 
joint venture with Iraqi partner Northern Oil Company to 
complete the contract. 
 
Details Unconfirmed 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Details of the actual terms of the agreement are 
unconfirmed.  The Chinese company has not verified Iraqi 
statements on either the value of the deal or its contents. 
Some oil industry insiders say that it will include 
construction of an electricity station by a Chinese firm. 
CNPC declined to comment, saying that the contract is not yet 
finalized.  The Iraqi Embassy said they have also been 
instructed not to comment on the deal prior to government 
approval. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Some oil industry analysts have criticized the 
Chinese deal, noting that most of the world's major oil firms 
are holding out for production-sharing arrangements. 
Likewise, they point out that the oil field in question is 
located in an area near the Iranian border that could pose 
security concerns. 
 
Comment 
------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) A Chinese researcher at the Energy Research 
Institute said that deal is "not a big thing for China," 
because of its low-profitability and relatively moderate 
production volume.  China's oil and commodity extraction 
companies are often willing to accept smaller, less-favorable 
deals than their Western counterparts in order to guarantee 
access to raw materials.  Industry analysts have told us that 
throughout Africa China is signing contracts to develop 
second- and third-rate mines and oil fields.  In this case, 
China apparently has pressed to complete an agreement, 
accepting slightly less-profitable compensation in order to 
establish themselves as good partners and open the door to 
Chinese access to an important source of oil.
