Ref: A) Khartoum 02702, B) Khartoum 02654 
 
¶1. (U) The following is a brief round-up of current issues from the 
Consulate General in Juba: 
 
--GoSS Goes Ahead with State Constitutions; 
--Minor SPLM Reshuffle Finishes with State Minister; 
--Penal Code Marks First Laws in Southern Sudan; 
--Juba Bridge Still Hanging On; and 
--Chinese Establish Foothold with GoSS.

GoSS Goes Ahead with State Constitutions 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) Minister of Legal Affairs 
and Constitutional Development Michael Makuei has put into law 9 of 
the 10 Southern state constitutions despite the fact that the 
national Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has not issued certifications as 
required by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).  Makuei 
announced his intentions and his justifications for doing so at the 
last Assessment and Evaluation Commission Power Sharing Working 
Group meeting (Ref A).  Only Warrap State has elected to wait for 
MoJ approval.  Although the move violates the CPA, Makuei told 
ConGen that he will no longer allow Northern stall tactics to delay 
development in the South.  In its defense, the GoSS assert that the 
NCP's objections to the naming of state capitals and defined borders 
in the constitutions is baseless and inconsistent with such 
designations for Khartoum.  Makuei said the National Congress Party 
(NCP) could take the issue to the Constitutional Court if it 
objected.

Minor SPLM Reshuffle Finishes with State Minister 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3. (U) The November 26 swearing in of Professor Elias Nyamlel 
Wakoson as State Minister for International Cooperation completes a 
small-scale SPLM cabinet shift that began three months ago with the 
naming of then- State Minister for International Cooperation Dr. 
Barnaba Benjamin as the GoSS Minister for Regional Cooperation. 
Other changes include the moving of GoSS Minister for the Interior 
(MoI) Daniel Awet to Governor of Lakes States, the naming of GoSS 
Presidential Advisor for Legal Affairs Paul Mayom as the new GoSS 
MoI, and the creation of a new cabinet post, Minister in the Office 
of the President, held by Dr. Luka Biong.  GoSS President Salva Kiir 
has also replaced four governors in the same time period:  Lakes, 
Western Equatoria, Warrap, and Northern Bahr al-Ghazal. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT:  While not the major change many in the SPLM were 
hoping for -- Kiir dislikes dramatic action -- the moves are a 
subtle power shift.  For example, some SPLM insiders hoped Dr. 
Justin Yaac would be replaced as Minister for Cabinet Affairs. 
While Kiir let him keep his position, the newly appointed Biong has 
almost the exact same portfolio.  END COMMENT. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Penal Code Marks First Laws in Southern Sudan 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) In its second session, the Southern Sudan Legislative 
Assembly passed a penal code based on the English Common Law system 
as the first new laws for Southern Sudan.  These laws were 
considered a priority, because some judges were still applying 
Sharia law in Southern Sudan.  The CPA states that all previous laws 
remain valid until new ones are passed.  The Penal Code will not be 
fully operational until the Assembly passes the Criminal Procedures 
Code and the Rules of Evidence, which is next up on the agenda. 
 
---------------------------- 
Juba Bridge Still Hanging On 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) The remaining lane of the Juba bridge over the Nile is still 
intact and open for traffic, and has been watched carefully by local 
police since the collapse of the inbound side of the bridge on 
November 7.  The bridge is a major artery and the only bridge over 
the Nile in all of Southern Sudan.  The partial collapse of the 
bridge was not a surprise given its age (last reconstructed in 
1976), lack of maintenance, and the high volume of heavy cargo 
traffic from Kenya.  To protect the remaining side of the bridge, 
police officers are regulating traffic.  While no scales are 
available, only one large truck is allowed on the bridge at a time, 
and the officers sporadically require loads from large trucks to be 
transferred onto several smaller trucks for the crossing.

Chinese Establish Foothold with GoSS 
------------------------------------

¶7. (U) The Chinese became associated with some of the worst abuses 
of the civil war when Northern soldiers brutally cleared large areas 
of landed, displacing thousands, so that Chinese companies could 
begin exploiting southern oil.  This has not stopped the GoSS, which 
is desperate for development, from establishing some direct ties 
with the Asian power.  There have been several GoSS delegations to 
Beijing, and Chinese workers are currently renovating the Southern 
Sudan Legislative Assembly building and doing some minor 
construction work at the SPLA Chief of Staff compound.  The GoSS has 
also awarded a subsection of the disputed Super Block B to a Chinese 
oil company, which has promised to build a pipeline to Kenya and a 
local refinery as well (Ref B).  In perhaps the biggest sign of the 
growing Chinese presence, the truck that finally collapsed one lane 
of the Juba bridge (see above) was laden with construction materials 
for what will be Juba's first Chinese restaurant.
