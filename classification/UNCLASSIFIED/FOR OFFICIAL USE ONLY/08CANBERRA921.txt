¶1. (U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Annabel Anderson, 
Assistant Secretary for Northern, Southern and Eastern 
Europe, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on September 
¶16. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a preliminary response, Anderson said the U.S. 
position on Russia's claims about Georgia tracked perfectly 
with the GOA understanding.  She noted that Foreign Minister 
Smith had released a statement on August 14 asserting 
Russia's military action had been "disproportionate," 
resulting in widespread damage and heavy casualties, and 
calling on Russia to honor the terms of the ceasefire, 
respect the territorial integrity of Georgia, and resolve its 
differences with Georgia through peaceful means. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Anderson took on board the U.S. request for another 
strong statement to counter Russian misrepresentations about 
Georgia, promising a more detailed response at a later time.
