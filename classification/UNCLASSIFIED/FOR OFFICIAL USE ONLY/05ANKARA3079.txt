SUBJECT:  TURKISH CUSTOMS ON WCO DEMARCHE, CSI, HABUR 
GATE, NEW AIR TRANSIT PASSENGER SYSTEM 
 
REF:  STATE 94927 
 
¶1. (U) Econ Counselor and Econoff delivered reftel 
demarche urging Turkish support for the World Customs 
Organization (WCO) Framework of Standards to Secure and 
Facilitate Global Trade to Acting Customs Undersecretary 
Riza Tuna Turagay on May 27.  We also raised the 
Container Security Initiative (CSI), the Habur border 
crossing with Iraq and the new system for clearing 
international transit passengers through Turkish 
airports. 
 
¶2. (U) WCO Framework:  Turagay stated that the GOT 
supports the framework without reservation, but is 
interested in technical assistance to implement it. 
Econoff noted that U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) has seconded an officer to the WCO to help build 
capacity in developing countries on this project. 
 
¶3. CSI:  Turagay reported that Turkish agencies were 
still considering the legal agreement needed to 
implement the Container Security Initiative, and said he 
expected MFA to convey a proposal to the U.S. side 
within two to four weeks.  He opined that the Turkish 
side would not offer CBP staff in Turkey diplomatic 
status.  He also noted that the GOT might need U.S. 
assistance in obtaining X-ray equipment for the port of 
Izmir. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Habur Gate:  Turagay acknowledged that, while 
both the GOT and the GOI are interested in a second 
border crossing, they have not agreed on a location and 
routes for access roads.  He noted that Customs staff 
discussed reconstruction of the existing crossing at 
Habur with the Turkish Union of Chambers and Commodity 
Exchanges (TOBB) earlier on May 27.  The project, which 
may last two months, is scheduled to begin soon.  While 
the GOT would try to avoid construction-related delays 
at Habur during this period, Turagay said it was not 
clear how much impact the project would have on 
crossings, now numbering about 4,000 daily. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Transit Passengers:  The Acting U/S maintained 
that the recently-changed system for international air 
transit passengers, in which passengers clear passport 
control at the port of entry while clearing customs at 
the final destination, was not acceptable.  He said it 
would be necessary to revert to a system of imposing 
both passport and customs controls at the port of entry, 
but with better preparation and interagency 
coordination, perhaps after the end of the summer 
tourist season.
