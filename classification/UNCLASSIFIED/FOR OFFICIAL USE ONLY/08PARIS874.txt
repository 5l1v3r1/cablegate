REF: STATE 47531 
 
(SBU)  We passed on May 6 reftel talking points to French MFA 
IO and AF offices overseeing the Somali piracy issue.  As 
France is a co-drafter with the U.S. of the draft resolution 
now circulating, we explained that we were providing reftel 
material to inform the GOF of the message we were sending to 
other UNSC members.  We invited comment on or any reaction to 
our points.  Our contacts were occupied with the visit of 
Somalia TFG President Yusuf, but AF DAS-equivalent Helene Le 
Gal said that she would provide on May 7 a briefing on 
Yusuf's visit and related matters, including the piracy 
resolution.
