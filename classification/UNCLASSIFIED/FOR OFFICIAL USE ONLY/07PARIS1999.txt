ENLARGEMENT AND ENHANCED ENGAGEMENT AT THE OECD MINISTERIAL 
 
REF:  (A) SECSTATE 67401 (NOTAL) (B) PARIS 1973 
 
¶1.  (SBU) EEB Assistant Secretary Dan Sullivan addressed the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Meeting 
of the Council at Ministerial Level (MCM) during the May 16 session 
on "Enlargement and Enhanced Engagement."  A/S Sullivan applauded on 
the decision to enhance relations with Brazil, China, India, 
Indonesia and South Africa.  He said that the U.S., in joining 
consensus to open discussions with Chile, Estonia, Israel, the 
Russian Federationa and Slovenia, had concerns about the 
Russian Government's commitment to democratic values, democratic 
institutions, and an open economy.  He stressed that there is a lot 
of work beyond WTO accession that Russia must do to meet the 
membership requirements.  A/S Sullivan said the U.S. was also 
encouraged by the decision to reform financing of the Organization 
in order to better reflect the need for OECD members to cover their 
costs and address rebalancing of burden sharing.  In addition, the 
OECD will need to examine representation and how decisions are made 
as the Organization enlarges.  He concluded by quoting Deputy 
Secretary Negroponte's remarks (see ref b) that the OECD agenda 
 
SIPDIS 
provides the opportunity to promote peace, stability, prosperity and 
democratic values through sound economic policies and good 
governance.  The text of A/S Sullian's remarks follows in para 2 
below. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Begin text of A/S Sullivan's May 15 remarks: 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
 
-- The United States is pleased that the Members have reached an 
agreement on the enlargement and enhanced engagement package.  Like 
others, we also want to commend the Secretary General for his 
leadership, vision and energy on these critical issues. 
 
-- This is a very important step for the OECD, one that will 
revitalize the organization, advancing our goals to expand the 
OECD's global reach, policy impact and relevance in the changing 
world economy. 
 
-- This is particularly true with regard to the decion to enhance 
relations with key emerging economies including Brazil, China, 
India, Indonesia and South Africa. 
 
-- The U.S. also joins consensus to invite the Secretary General to 
open discussion with Chile, Estonia, Israel, the Russian Federation, 
and Slovenia to set out terms for their accession to the OECD. 
 
-- The global geographic diversity - Latin America, Asia, Africa and 
the Middle East - represented by the enlargement anQnhanced 
engagement countries is particularly welcome by the United States 
 
-- Regarding Russia, we share the concerns articulated by the United 
Kingdom.  I would reiterate points we made at the ECSS last month, 
namely: 
 
o  that the United States has concerns about the 
Russian Government's commitment to democratic values, democratic 
institutions, and an open economy; and 
 
o  that there is a lot of work beyond WTO accession that Russia must 
do to meet the membership requirements. 
 
-- We are satisfied that acceptable political language with regard 
to addressing commitment to democratic institutions and an open 
economy in the accession process has been included in the text. 
 
-- We are also encouraged by the agreement reached on the reform of 
financing, but challenges remain over the coming months as we agree 
on new financing arrangements that better reflect the need for OECD 
members to cover 
their costs and address rebalancing of burden sharing. 
 
-- In addition, bringing in new members presents us with significant 
challenges with regard to how the Organization will function.  As 
the responsible board of directors of the OECD, we need to ensure 
that it is able to function efficiently and effectively. 
 
-- We look forward to working with the Secretary General and the 
other members of the Council on these issues in order to provide the 
Organization the tools it needs to meet today's challenges. 
 
-- In conclusion, I think that today's decision on enhanced 
engagement and enlargement - although difficult, and at times 
contentious - should be something we are proud of and should 
celebrate.  As my Deputy Secretary of State, John Negroponte stated 
yesterday: 
 
QUOTE - Our agenda is full of opportunities to advance the 
fundamental mission of promoting peace, stability, prosperity, and 
democratic values the sound economic policies and good 
governance.  We should remain true to our founding vision and high 
standards, confident that in real partnership we will achieve real 
success - across the Atlantic and around the globe.  END QUOTE.
