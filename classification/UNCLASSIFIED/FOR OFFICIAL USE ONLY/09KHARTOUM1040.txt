¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Irish Ambassador Gerard Corr (resident in Cairo) 
met with DCM Asquino on September 8 to update him on the status of 
the two aid workers, Irish national Sharon Cummins and Ugandan 
citizen Hilda Kawuki, who were kidnapped in North Darfur on July 3. 
Ambassador Corr confirmed that Irish Foreign Minister Michael Martin 
had been in Khartoum September 6-7, working with the Government of 
Sudan (GOS) to expedite the release of the two aid workers.  Based 
on developments during Irish FM's visit, Ambassador Corr seemed 
relatively optimistic that the hostages might be released by the end 
of the Ramadan holiday, which concludes on or about September 20. 
Ambassador Corr requested that during Special Envoy Gration's 
current visit to Sudan, he raise with GOS officials, including Dr. 
Ghazi Selahaddin, the USG's strong support for a peaceful resolution 
of the hostage taking situation that will result in the two women 
being released.  The DCM relayed this request to Charge Whitehead, 
who is with SE Gration and his delegation in Juba.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The DCM, RSO, and Poloff met with at his request with 
Irish Ambassador Gerard Corr on September 8 to discuss the latest 
developments in the hostage-taking of Irish national Sharon Cummins 
and Ugandan citizen Hilda Kawuki.    The two female aid workers, who 
work for GOAL, an Irish non-governmental organization (NGO), were 
kidnapped on July 3 when armed gunmen invaded the GOAL compound in 
Kutum, North Darfur.  Ambassador Corr told the DCM that the 
kidnappers had previously requested two million USD in exchange for 
the hostages.  As of three days ago, the group had lowered its 
ransom demand to 300,000 USD.  Ambassador Corr added that he 
believed the group, which was initially eleven members, may now have 
dwindled to four individuals.  At no point has the group made any 
political demands.  Their motivation in the abduction clearly is for 
criminal gain according to the ambassador. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Ambassador Corr described Irish Foreign Minister Michael 
Martin's September 6-7 visit to Khartoum as productive.  Based on a 
conversation between the Irish FM and Presidential Adviser Dr. Ghazi 
Selahaddin, Ambassador Corr said he was optimistic that a resolution 
would be reached by the end of the Ramadan holiday.  Ambassador Corr 
reported that shortly after the kidnapping, Sudan State Minister for 
Humanitarian Affairs Abdel Baqi al-Jailani was appointed to take the 
lead in dealing with the Irish in this matter.  During the previous 
two hostage-taking incidents, the French and Canadian government 
representatives dealt almost exclusively with the National 
Intelligence and Security Service (NISS). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Irish believe there was a failed attempt to secure the 
hostages' release three weeks ago when the GOS, presumably at the 
recommendation of al-Jailani, provided financial compensation and 
possibly gifts in kind, such as jeep vehicles, to Kutum tribal and 
religious leaders.  NISS had helicopters standing by and dispatched 
a fixed-wing aircraft to El Fasher, but the hostages were never 
handed over.  Since that time, GOS seems to have taken a much harder 
line with the kidnappers and asked the Irish not to negotiate or 
interfere with their new isolation technique. 
 
¶5. (SBU) This change in strategy might have also been prompted by 
the kidnapping of two UNAMID civilians in Zalingei, West Darfur on 
August 29 (ref b).  The latter was the fourth hostage-taking 
incident in Darfur to occur within the last six months.  The Irish 
Ambassador confided that GOS officials have discussed using force to 
carry out a rescue attempt, termed as "Plan B," but they have 
promised they would not do so unless the hostages were under serious 
threat.  NISS has reportedly indicated the next few days are 
extremely important for a successful release of the hostages. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Ambassador Corr requested that during Special Envoy 
Gration's current visit to Sudan, he raise with GOS officials, 
including Dr. Ghazi Selahaddin, the USG's strong support for a 
peaceful resolution of the hostage taking situation that will result 
in the two women being released.  The DCM relayed this request to 
Charge Whitehead, who is with SE Gration and his delegation in Juba. 
 Ambassador Corr said that the Embassy of Ireland in Washington will 
also be in contact with the Department to request such support. 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Comment: Ambassador Corr appeared to be more cautiously 
optimistic during this visit than on past occasions that there is 
now  "a greater GOS determination" to resolve the hostage crisis in 
the coming weeks.  The Post continues to monitor this case closely 
in addition to the separate kidnappings of two United 
Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) expatriate 
civilians in Zalengei, West Darfur.  The RSO intends to travel to 
Darfur September 10-12 to follow-up with UNAMID security officials. 
The Mission will also continue to liaise closely with the Irish 
Hostage Negotiations Unit based in Khartoum.  End Comment.
