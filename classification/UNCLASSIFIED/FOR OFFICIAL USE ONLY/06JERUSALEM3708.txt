Humanitarian Update 
------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The Rafah crossing was closed August 20 and 21, 
according to USAID Gaza-based staff.  Rafah opened August 19, 
for both entries into Gaza and departures to Egypt. 
Approximately 2,570 people departed Gaza through Rafah, 
August 19, according to USAID Gaza-based staff.  That number 
included USAID and PAO grantees scheduled to begin 
educational programs in the U.S. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The Karni/al-Mintar crossing is closed August 21, 
according to USAID Gaza-based staff.  The crossing was last 
open August 15.  According to USAID Gaza-based staff, there 
are no reported shortages of basic commodities.  While wheat 
flour is currently available on the market (and expected to 
last for a week), Gazan flour mills are out of wheat and are 
not producing flour, according to a USAID survey.    The 
Nahal Oz fuel transfer crossing is open August 21, as it was 
August 20.
