SUBJECT: TUNISIANS PUBLICLY CONDEMN AQIM KIDNAPPING OF 
AUSTRIANS 
 
REF: A. TUNIS 235 
     ¶B. TUNIS 227 
 
¶1. (SBU) In the wake of the March 10 claim by Al-Qaeda in the 
Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) that it had kidnapped two 
Austrian tourists in southern Tunisia (reftels), political 
activists and intellectuals have condemned the targeting of 
civilians and the spread of extremist ideologies.  The GOT's 
nuanced public statements on the veracity of the AQIM claim 
seem to have caused many prominent Tunisians, parties and 
organizations to refrain from public comment.  However, the 
Tunisian public's almost zero-tolerance of terrorism is 
clearly reflected in the statements of those who have already 
publicly denounced the kidnapping. 
 
¶2. (U) The following is a sample of public reactions: 
 
-- Independent Opposition Progressive Democratic Party (PDP): 
"The PDP opposes the use of violence as a means of realizing 
political goals and calls for the immediate and unconditional 
freeing of the two hostages." 
 
-- Nejib Chebbi, 2009 PDP Presidential Candidate: "This 
morally reprehensible act necessitates my unequivocal 
condemnation.  No argument can be invoked to justify an act 
that targets innocent civilian victims and risks drawing the 
country into an impasse of blind violence...I call for the 
immediate and unconditional liberation of the two Austrian 
tourists and reiterate that political reform and the 
resolution of social problems should be undertaken through 
citizens' dialogue and peaceful activities." 
 
-- Kamel Ben Younes, Columnist, private Arabic daily 
as-Sabah: "This (terrorist) act is refused..refused...there 
is no room for justifying it or accepting those associated 
with it...It's playing with fire." 
 
-- Zyed Krichen, Editor, private French weekly magazine 
Realites: "Terrorism is condemnable in itself. There is no 
attenuating circumstance...We must all try to make our youth 
deaf to these (terrorist) siren calls of death."
