REF: REF: STATE 59002 
 
------------------------------- 
Overview of FY-2006 ESF Request 
------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) As stated in the Mission Performance Plan, Zimbabwe 
today is a paradox.  On the one hand, President Robert Mugabe 
and his ruling party have tightened their grip over the 
country in the past year and have benefited from the split in 
the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).  On the 
other hand, the worsening economy, the increasingly open 
succession battle, and growing international isolation are 
driving deep wedges into the ruling party.  In this context, 
we believe the request below is the absolute minimum amount 
needed to sustain democratic forces in this country and keep 
alive prospects for a national, democratic revival in 
Zimbabwe.  As Zimbabwe's protracted political crisis 
continues, it is essential for the U.S. to maintain support 
to democratic forces.

FY 2006 ESF Request 
------------------- 
 
Elections and Political Processes--$300,000 ($300,000 Annual) 
 
¶3. (SBU) The anticipated rural council elections will be the 
last nationwide elections before the 2008 presidential 
election, providing a key testing ground for local election 
observers and political parties.  The funds requested will 
help local election monitors document electoral 
irregularities and conduct a parallel vote count.  These 
funds would also help all democratic political parties 
prepare for national elections by developing non-violent 
standards of behavior, conducting voter education, and 
articulating campaign messages.  These activities serve U.S. 
policy interests by increasing pressure on the GOZ to hold 
free and fair elections.  USAID would obligate the funds 
through existing mechanisms. 
 
Sustaining Civil Society--$1,670,000  ($1,670,000 Annual) 
 
¶4. (SBU) The GOZ, convinced that civil society is directly 
supporting the opposition party, has stepped up its 
surveillance and persecution of the NGO sector.  NGO meetings 
and workshops are routinely prohibited or interrupted by 
security agents.  NGO leaders are detained, harassed, and 
threatened.  The NGO Bill was not signed into law, but the 
threat of introducing new draconian legislation to increase 
the government's powers to control the funding, registration, 
and activities of NGOs remains.  Despite government 
repression, the NGO sector remains, for now, alive and 
energized. 
 
¶5. (SBU) This allocation would continue and extend Post's 
existing activities in support of a wide range of NGOs, both 
local and regional, working in the areas of human rights, 
legal aid, peace building, civic education, and lobbying. 
These funds would sustain these organizations and preserve 
independent democratic voices for a time when Zimbabwe is 
ready for democratic change.  These programs support U.S. 
policy in Zimbabwe by ensuring that important vestiges of the 
country's democratic infrastructure are not extinguished 
until that moment inevitably comes.  USAID would obligate the 
funds through a US-based nonprofit organization that provides 
small grants to local NGOs. 
 
Sustaining Independent Media--$1,000,000 ($1,000,000 Annual) 
 
HARARE 00000977  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) The independent media in Zimbabwe have been badly 
damaged by the GOZ's aggressive campaign to stifle criticism, 
at home and abroad, of its flawed policies and to prevent the 
democratic opposition from communicating with the electorate. 
 The people of Zimbabwe are desperate for alternative sources 
of news, information, and platforms for free speech. 
 
¶7. (SBU) This allocation would support the continued 
existence of the independent media in Zimbabwe.  Funds would 
support the Voice of America Studio 7 radio program, which 
now boosts approximately one million listeners per day. 
Aiding the continued existence of independent media in 
Zimbabwe directly serves U.S. policy by ensuring checks 
against the government monopoly on information and providing 
important outlets for opposing viewpoints.  USAID would 
obligate the funds through VOA.
