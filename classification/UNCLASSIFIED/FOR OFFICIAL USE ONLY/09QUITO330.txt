SUBJECT: ECUADOR'S RESPONSE TO H1N1 PORK TRADE BAN DEMARCHE 
 
REF:  STATE 44254 
 
¶1.  (SBU) This is in response to reftel demarche asking host 
countries to remove trade bans on pork due to H1N1 fears.  On May 6, 
the DCM, accompanied by USDA/FAS, USDA/APHIS, and Econ 
representatives, met with Agriculture Minister Poveda to deliver the 
demarche points.  The head of Agrocalidad (Ecuador's sanitary 
authority), and the Ministry of Agriculture's Under Secretary for 
Livestock were also in the meeting. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) After presentation of the demarche, Minister Poveda noted 
that the GOE planned that same day to replace Agrocalidad's current 
Resolution 030.  Resolution 030, issued on April 28, banned the 
import of U.S. and Mexican pork and pork products, and swine and its 
genetic materials, due to H1N1 virus fears.  Two draft resolutions 
are under consideration, one that would reportedly ban imports of 
live swine globally, and another that would ban only live swine from 
Canada, due to the recent human-pig transmission of H1N1 flu in that 
country.  The resolution would last as long as Ecuador's state of 
emergency (currently 60 days).  Upon issuance of a new resolution, 
Ecuadorian Customs would comply with the new requirements 
immediately and permit entry for those products that are no longer 
banned, said the Minister. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The different GOE offices involved are evidently 
attempting to clarify and modify the trade restrictions, but their 
priorities appear slightly different and the outcome uncertain.  The 
head of Agrocalidad declared that he would like to open Ecuador to 
all pork-related imports, while the Under Secretary for Livestock 
appeared more cautious.  The Agriculture Minister noted that his 
personal preference would be to ban all live swine. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  These discrepancies may remain an obstacle to a 
rapid reversal of the April 28 ban on U.S. pork products, but we 
expect and hope for a less stringent restriction in the next few 
days.
