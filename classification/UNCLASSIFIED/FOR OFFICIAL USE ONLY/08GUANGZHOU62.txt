¶1. (SBU) Summary: Thousands of stranded travelers have successfully 
departed Guangzhou's train station in the last two days, but 
progress has attracted as many as 200,000 more travelers to the 
station.  Police efforts to maintain general control appeared 
effective even as isolated incidents of disorder occurred.  End 
summary. 
 
Trains Take Away Thousands; Thousands More Come 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. (U) Media reports indicated 116 trains left Guangzhou's two train 
stations on January 31, carrying approximately 200,000 passengers 
home for the Lunar New Year.  Guangzhou Railway estimates of how 
long it would take to clear the backlog have varied, but the railway 
finally conceded today that it would be impossible to send all 
ticket holders home before New Year's Eve on February 6. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Thousands of additional travelers have arrived at the area 
surrounding the main Guangzhou train station since service resumed. 
Many of the newly arriving travelers told Congenoffs they decided to 
travel today after seeing media reports of restored rail services. 
Xinhua News Agency criticized conflicting and overly-positive 
messages in today's Guangzhou Daily Newspaper, predicting that such 
news would cause increased demand for travel services at Guangzhou's 
train stations. 
 
General Order and Minor Incidents as People Move 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Despite general order at police roadblocks and traffic 
control points, Congenoff witnessed occasional outbursts as 
frustrated travelers struggled to find a path that would lead into 
the Rail Station Square and subsequently allow them to enter the 
station.  Police and military presence remained heavy.  Their 
efforts appeared to be well coordinated, but Congenoff observed some 
people tripping and others pushing as they were directed from a 
holding area into the station square.   Congenoff also saw an 
isolated incident of three travelers beating a fourth after accusing 
him of stealing a wallet.  Police eventually broke up the fight.
