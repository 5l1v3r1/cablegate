¶1.  AIT ECON Chief delivered reftel demarche jointly with EC 
Representative Brian McDonald on October 5 to Ministry of 
Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Hsieh Fa-dah.  Utilizing 
reftel points, Econ Chief emphasized the need to move forward 
on Taiwan's long-standing commitment to open up Taiwan's 
government procurement market.  He asked for a rapid response 
from Hsieh so the U.S. and the EC could make another effort 
at the WTO to secure agreement for Taiwan to accede to the 
Government Procurement Agreement (GPA).  Econ Chief noted the 
U.S. is not confident the new proposal would be acceptable to 
China while underscoring our view that the existing U.S. - EC 
footnote proposal is a fair and reasonable way to resolve 
outstanding differences. 
 
¶2.  McDonald presented to Hsieh the EC's proposed language 
for Taiwan's accession.  AIT/T has sent the EC's proposed 
text to EAP/TC, USTR (Eric Altbach) and AIT/W by unclassified 
email.  Econ Chief told Hsieh the U.S. has not yet agreed to 
the specific language, but is working closely with  the EC on 
the text and tactics to get Taiwan into the GPA.  He and 
McDonald asked Hsieh for a rapid response from the Taiwan 
side so we can move this issue forward.  Econ Chief noted the 
U.S. desire to move forward on a bilateral government 
procurement agreement with Taiwan if efforts for a 
multilateral agreement fail.  McDonald said the EC would also 
seek a bilateral agreement in the same circumstances. 
 
¶3.  Hsieh said Taiwan would seriously consider the new 
proposal from the U.S. and the EC and respond.  He said this 
issue will require careful review before Taiwan can respond 
because it is a very sensitive issue involving sovereignty. 
He reiterated Taiwan's strong desire to join the GPA while 
noting Taiwan could not accept the existing U.S. - EC 
proposal because of its references to sovereignty.
