Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The government of Brazil is interested in increasing 
bilateral health cooperation with the United States and particularly 
in setting up joint programs in Africa, especially in the area of 
training medical technicians.  According to Brazilian contacts, 
working together on health issues is of strategic importance.  In 
addition to coordinating national strategies, Amazonas State is 
seeking U.S. assistance in battling malaria. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During his visit to Rio de Janeiro as head of the U.S. 
delegation to the 15th Pan Am Games, Secretary of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) Michael Leavitt discussed bilateral health 
cooperation with Brazilian counterparts.  Ambassador Clifford Sobel, 
HHS Office of Global Health Affairs Director William Steiger, HHS 
Office of Global Health Affairs Americas Director Rosaly 
Correa-de-Araujo and notetaker accompanied Secretary Leavitt.  End 
Summary. 
 
Bilateral Health Cooperation 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Noting that he has served as a researcher and professor at 
the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) for 27 years, Health Minister 
Jose Gomes Temporao stated that he views bilateral cooperation on 
health issues as not only extremely important, but as an area of 
strategic interest for both the United States and Brazil.  Secretary 
Leavitt responded that with President Bush's and President Lula's 
recent calls for increased interaction between our two countries, a 
robust health agenda could serve as a fundamental area of common 
interest.  He stated that he looked forward to having a health 
attache seconded soon to the Embassy in Brasilia. 
 
Joint Commission Review 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Health Ministry International Relations Minister Santiago 
Alcazar pointed to the "excellent" work of the joint commission on 
health issues as a starting point for further activities.  He noted 
that the commission had established five areas of bilateral 
cooperation, discussed the ethical requirements of research on human 
subjects, made clear that there was no intention to change health 
regulations or legislation in the United States or Brazil, and 
focused on cooperation in third countries, especially in curbing the 
spread of malaria. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Commending the commission's goals, Secretary Leavitt said 
that Brazilian efforts to train medical workers overseas complements 
U.S. programs in Latin America and potential activity in Africa.  He 
noted that the United States would be interested in learning how 
Brazil trains medical technicians and that the United States and 
Brazil could possibly cooperate on mounting joint projects. 
Concurring with Secretary Leavitt's idea, Minister Temporao said 
that Brazil has trained approximately 300,000 medical technicians 
already and would like to learn about our experience in Panama.  He 
added that Brazil is curious about U.S. hospital care because Brazil 
wants to improve hospital quality.  Brazil would also like to learn 
more about Medicare and Medicaid and how they work with HMOs as well 
as organizing a healthcare system with public payments and private 
providers.  Noting that FIOCRUZ already has an established 
relationship with the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), 
FIOCRUZ President Paulo Buss asked Secretary Leavitt to press for 
even greater cooperation between the two bodies.  Secretary Leavitt 
said we would be pleased to add these issues to our bilateral health 
agenda. 
 
FIOCRUZ Efforts in Africa 
 
SAO PAULO 00000726  002 OF 003 
 
 
------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) FIOCRUZ President Buss noted that President Lula is 
interested in opening a FIOCRUZ office in Mozambique and that this 
entity would have ties to the African Union in Addis Ababa.  This 
project could create medical training courses and train public 
health professionals, particularly in Portuguese-speaking African 
countries.  FIOCRUZ has already established a school of public 
health in Angola, offering a top-level master's program to 35 
students.  FIOCRUZ is also assisting Mozambique's counterpart 
institution in creating a similar Master's program in Mozambique. 
The proposed school will have regular exchanges with FIOCRUZ's 
Master's program in Angola, focusing on diagnosing infectious 
diseases.  Brazil is eploring a similar initiative in 
Guinea-Bissau, h added.  FIOCRUZ would be interested in partnering 
with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prvention (CDC) and 
the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Global Health 
Affairs to wrk on some of these ideas.  Basso also suggested 
creating an NIH-FIOCRUZ working group on infectious diseases. 
 
Amazonas State Meeting 
---------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) During a separate meeting with Amazonas State Secretary 
for Planning and Development Denis Minev, Secretary Leavitt asked if 
Amazonas State had an interest in the United States helping battle 
the state's increasing malaria problem.  When Tropical Medicine 
Foundation of Amazonas (FMT-AM) President Sinesio Talhari noted that 
the Amazonas State Government is working hard to control malaria, 
FMT-AM Specialist in Malaria Investigation Marcus Vincius Guimaraes 
de Lacerda added that even with the federal government assisting, 
malaria growth is difficult to curb.  Lacerda said that the sheer 
size of Amazonas State and the rapid growth of pockets of 
inhabitants outside the capital, Manaus, make anti-malaria efforts 
challenging.  Distributing bed nets could be a good strategy for 
battling malaria, he added.  FMT-AM President Talhari stated that 
malaria resistance, the need for newer drugs, and the lack of 
training and technology are additional difficulties.  Secretary 
Minev added that testing for malaria takes a long time, meaning that 
farmers, who are often from the rural, difficult-to-reach and more 
highly-prone to malaria areas, lose labor time and prefer to not get 
tested.  Secretary Leavitt responded that joint research seems like 
a potential area of cooperation as a possible first step in looking 
at fighting the spread of malaria. 
 
Areas for Joint Work 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Secretary Leavitt identified several priority areas for 
joint work in which the United States would primarily provide 
technical assistance.  The two sides discussed the development of a 
Biosafety Level 4 laboratory in Brazil; exploration for the creation 
of a training center for health-care workers in the Southern Cone, 
modeled after the Regional Health-Care Training Center in Panama 
that is part of the health component of the President's Initiative 
to Advance the Cause of Social Justice in the Western Hemisphere; 
the exchange of scientific experts between Brazilian and American 
institutions; the Promotion of pharmaceutical research and 
development in Brazil; and joint work on malaria and HIV/AIDS in 
Portuguese-speaking Africa.  These priority areas would be part of a 
 U.S.-Brazil Health Alliance to serve Latin America. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Along with the other members of the U.S. Delegation, 
Secretary Leavitt and Ambassador Sobel attended the opening 
 
SIPDIS 
ceremonies of the XV Pan American Games on July 13, and the next day 
met with the U.S. baseball and men's gymnastics teams.  The 
Secretary and Ambassador Sobel also dined with Pernambuco State 
 
SIPDIS 
Governor Eduardo Campos and granted a number of interviews with 
Brazilian and international media outlets (print and television), at 
FIOCRUZ, at the Pan American Athletes' Village and in a separate 
press opportunity at his hotel.
