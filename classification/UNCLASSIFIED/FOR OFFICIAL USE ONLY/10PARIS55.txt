TRANSITION PLAN 
 
REF: STATE 04108 
 
¶1. (SBU) France is entirely in agreement that the ISAF 
transition plan adopted at NATO would be an excellent 
deliverable for the London conference, but should not be 
confused with a plan to withdraw ISAF forces.  Francois 
Delmas of the French interagency Afghanistan-Pakistan cell 
said on January 15 in response to the points contained in 
reftel that the London conference is an opportunity to 
reconfirm the international community's political commitment 
to Afghanistan.  Given the Karzai administration's 
difficulties in forming a government, this will be more 
challenging.  However, that makes concrete deliverables like 
the ISAF operational plan annex describing the provincial 
transition process all the more valuable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Delmas also said that President Sarkozy had repeated 
numerous times, most recently following the death of a French 
soldier in Afghanistan on January 11, that France would 
continue its mission in Afghanistan.  The GOF therefore 
strongly agrees on the importance of avoiding any suggestion 
that the ISAF transition plan implies a drawdown of 
international forces.
