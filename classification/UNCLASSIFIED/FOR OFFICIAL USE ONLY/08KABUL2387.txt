SUBJECT: PREPARATIONS FOR PHASE 1 VOTER REGISTRATION 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Provincial staff of the Independent Elections 
Commission (IEC) are making tentative progress in preparing 
for the October 6 start date for Phase 1 voter registration, 
according to the reports of PRT field officers in Kapisa, 
Bamiyan, Panjshir, and Parwan.  Kapisa, Bamiyan, and Parwan 
have hired the final level of field staff, the District Field 
Coordinators (DFCs), and planned to begin DFC training in 
coordination with UNDP/ELECT field officers September 1.  The 
provincial office in Kapisa optimistically estimates that the 
DFCs will need a week, or less, to verify the planned voter 
registration sites, a key step that will facilitate security 
and logistics planning.  The IEC in Kabul reports that poor 
security is hampering efforts to hire local staff in Ghazni 
and Wardak, especially in areas dominated by ethnic Pashtuns. 
 Despite recruitment through appeals on radio and TV and from 
prominent local figures, two of Ghazni's 18 districts have no 
DFC applicants, according to IEC headquarters and provincial 
officials.

VOTER OUTREACH 
-------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Kapisa and Panjshir provincial electoral officers 
have begun to plan for voter outreach campaigns, including 
incorporating civic and voter education into weekly mosque 
sermons.  IEC headquarters began training provincial-level 
civic educators on August 30 and expects district-level civic 
educators to start voter outreach campaigns September 15.  In 
recent meetings with the USG, the governors of Nuristan and 
Kunar expressed their support for elections and underscored 
the importance of voter outreach and education.  The two 
governors, like district governors in Panjshir and Ghazni and 
the Ghazni provincial electoral officer, opined that the 
degree of difficulty of travel -- whether the obstacle is 
distance or security -- will be key in shaping citizens' 
decisions to register and vote. Spot interviews with 
residents in rural areas suggest that, with voting day almost 
a year away, everyday concerns outweigh the distant prospect 
of elections.

SECURITY PLANNING 
----------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Excepting Parwan, IEC provincial staff have yet to 
begin formal interactions with other sub-national government 
elements.  Governors, provincial councils, and district 
governors have no formal role in voter registration, but many 
say they would like to be consulted.  In particular, only in 
Parwan have provincial IEC staff begun to work with the 
police and army to discuss voter registration security 
planning.  The signing of the Joint Security Order between 
MOI, MOD, and ISAF on August 24 was a significant step 
forward and opens the door for improved coordination at the 
sub-national level.  Additionally, as the ANP and ANA 
regional and corps commanders begin to prepare to deliver 
detailed plans to their commanders in the second week in 
September, this situation may improve.
