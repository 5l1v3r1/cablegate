¶1. Post grants country clearance for RSO James P. Doherty and 
FSNI Raymond Millar April 16 -20, 2007 to visit Apia, Samoa to 
meet Samoan Police regarding an ongoing investigation and 
toprovide constituent post services. 
 
¶2. Post understands that no assistance from the Embassy is 
requested. If necessary, Embassy point of contact is Charge 
d'Affaires George W. Colvin Jr. The Embassy can be contacted 
during business hours at telephone number 21631 and 21436, and 
at 21514 or 7771776 after duty hours. Callers from outside Samoa 
should first dial country code 685. 
 
¶3. Embassy Apia is unable to provide "meet and greet" service at 
the airport. Visitors can use local taxi service, which is 
generally safe, reliable and frequent. Taxi fare from the 
airport to downtown Apia hotels costs about WST 50.00 (roughly 
US $20.00). All forms of public transportation are generally 
safe at all times of the day; however, at night visitors should 
use common sense precautions to prevent becoming a target of 
crime. 
 
¶4. American citizens visiting Samoa for 60 days or less (for 
either official or private travel) may enter the country without 
a visa. Immigration officials grant entry permits upon arrival. 
SamoaN authorities require visitors to pay $40.00 Tala 
(approximately $15.50) tax in Samoan currency at the airport 
upon departure from Samoa. 
 
¶5. Please note that Embassy Apia does not have the ability to 
cash personal checks. Samoan Tala can be obtained at 
conveniently located ATMs, including at the airport. Travelers 
can also exchange currency at the airport upon arrival; both 
Westpac and ANZ have branches at the airport and elsewhere in 
Samoa. 
 
¶6. Samoa is considered a low-threat environment. Theft and petty 
crimes sometimes occur, but are usually non-confrontational in 
nature. There are no terrorist groups or support groups believed 
to be operating in Samoa at this time. Visitors should remain 
vigilant with regard to their personal security and exercise 
caution during their stay. They should also be aware of the 
State Department's Consular Information sheet for Samoa and the 
most recent worldwide caution public announcements, which are 
available via the internet at htt://travel.state.gov.
