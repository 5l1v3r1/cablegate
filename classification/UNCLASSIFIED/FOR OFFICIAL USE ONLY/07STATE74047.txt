SUBJECT: VOTING INSTRUCTIONS:  SPECIAL TRIBUNAL FOR LEBANON 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request.  USUN is instructed to 
vote for and co-sponsor the resolution on the Special 
Tribunal for Lebanon.  USUN may draw from the explanation of 
vote (EOV) in para 2 below.  End action request. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Begin EOV text. 
 
I would now like to make a few remarks in my national 
capacity. 
 
We welcome the adoption of resolution xxxx on the 
establishment of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. 
 
By adopting this resolution, the Council has demonstrated its 
commitment to the Lebanese people to ensure that there shall 
be no impunity for political assassinations.  Those who 
killed Rafiq Hariri and so many others will be brought to 
justice and held responsible for their crimes. 
 
Establishing the tribunal will also serve to deter future 
political assassinations.  Those who might be tempted to 
commit similar crimes will know there will be consequences 
for perpetuating Lebanon's troubled history of political 
violence and intimidation. 
 
We know that it was necessary and right for the Council to 
act now.  The Council approved the tribunal agreement and 
statute on November 21, 2006.  Since that time, the 
legitimate government and the democratically-elected 
government and the parliamentary majority have tried every 
possible means to convince the Speaker of Parliament to 
fulfill his constitutional responsibility to convene 
parliament so that final action on the tribunal could be 
taken.  But to no avail. 
 
Several influential parties visited Lebanon in an effort to 
find a framework in which parliament could be convened. 
These include the Arab League, UN Legal Counsel Nicolas 
Michel, and the Secretary-General himself.  After five months 
of tireless efforts to reach a solution to the impasse facing 
his country, Prime Minister Siniora sent the 
Secretary-General a letter on May 14 asking that the matter 
 
SIPDIS 
be put before the Security Council to take a &binding8 
decision to establish the Special Tribunal.   The 
Secretary-General endorsed the Prime Minister's request one 
 
SIPDIS 
day later after concluding that all diplomatic efforts had 
been exhausted. 
 
No one can say that the Lebanese Government, the 
Secretary-General, or the Security Council failed to pursue 
 
SIPDIS 
every possible option short of Council action to establish 
the tribunal.  But those opposed to the tribunal made sure 
there were no such options available. 
 
We have heard many voices warn of the risks to peace and 
stability in Lebanon. In the days ahead, we urge all parties 
to act responsibly and abide by their obligations to support 
Lebanon's sovereignty and political independence.   For our 
part, we concluded that failure to act in support of Lebanon 
was unacceptable.  There can be no peace and stability 
without justice. 
 
In conclusion, the United States reaffirms our support for 
Lebanon.  With the passage of this resolution, we are 
confident that the Security Council will live up to its 
commitment to support Lebanon in its pursuit of justice. 
 
End EOV text.
