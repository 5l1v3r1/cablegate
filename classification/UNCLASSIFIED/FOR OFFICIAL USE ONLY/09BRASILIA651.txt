¶1.  (SBU) On May 18, 2009, the Deputy Chief of Mission provided both 
the head of Brazil's Secretariat for Aquaculture and Fishing (SEAP) 
(which is a unit within the Presidency and separate from the 
Agriculture Ministry) Altemir Gregolin and the Ministry of Exterior 
Relations' (MRE) Director of the Department for the Environment and 
Special Themes Luis Alberto Figueiredo Machado with a copy of the 
May 4 Media Note contained in REFTEL.  That Media Note concerned 
Public Law 101-162 and the protection of sea turtles from harmful 
shrimp fishing practices.  In pertinent part, the Media Note states 
that "[i]f shrimp products are from a non-certified country [such as 
Brazil], a government official of the harvesting nation must also 
certify the shrimp was caught without harming sea turtles.  . . . 
However, the Department of State must determine in advance that a 
country wishing to use this exception has in place an enforcement 
and catch segregation system for making such individual shipment 
certifications.  Presently, only Brazil and Australia have shown 
that they have a system in place for specific fisheries." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) This information was also provided to Francisco Osvaldo 
Barbosa, International Affairs Advisor for SEAP; Fernando Lyrio, 
Head of the Office for International Affairs for the Ministry of the 
Environment; Maria Ines Miranda, Advisor to the president for the 
Brazilian EPA (IBAMA); and Fernando Coimbra, the MRE' Director of 
the Division for the Environment.
