MEMBERSHIP BID 
 
REF: STATE 33709 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Post delivered the demarche on Kosovo's 
membership bid (Reftel) to the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) and World Bank (WB) to Finance Minister Guillermo 
Zuniga Chaves (WB Governor, IMF Alternate Governor) on April 
15 and Central Bank President Franciso de Paula Gutierrez (WB 
Alternate Governor, IMF Governor) on April 17.  The Finance 
Minister received the message positively.  The President of 
the Central Bank said that he would await instructions from 
the Costa Rican Foreign Ministry though he was receptive to 
the USG position.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) With both officials, Post emphasized the 
consistency of following-up recognition of Kosovo with 
supporting Kosovo's membership to the international financial 
community, the need to strengthen economic stability in the 
Balkans, and the need to provide Kosovo access to 
professional, public sector financial and macroeconomic 
policy advice.  Minister Zuniga stated -- positively -- that 
"he would look over the proposal."  Post believed that he was 
not aware of the need to cast a vote and noted the IMF 
schedule for voting.  Central Bank President Gutierrez was 
aware of the Kosovo vote and the need to vote within six 
weeks (as a WB Governor).  He also explained that he would 
vote in accordance with instructions from the Foreign 
Ministry.  Nonetheless, President Gutierrez was receptive to 
Post's argument for supporting Kosovo.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Given the GOCR,s quick recognition of Kosovar 
independence and statehood, we would anticipate that the GOCR 
will support Kosovo,s application to the IMF and the WB. 
Such a decision would be consistent with the Foreign 
Ministry,s first major decision regarding Kosovo (and we 
will follow up with the MFA).  Also, the Finance Ministry has 
close ties to Treasury -- and both the IMF and the WB -- and 
understands the importance of professional international 
assistance.
