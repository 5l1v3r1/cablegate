SUBJECT: SPLA ACCUSED OF TOTURING SUSPECTS WHILE SPLA 
COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE ARREST ANOTHER OFFICER FOR BEATING A DETAINEE 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: SPLA military police have been accused of 
torturing employees of a U.S. company operating in Juba, Sudan.  Two 
of these individuals were reportedly subject to psychological abuse 
as well as beatings and sodomy.  In an unrelated incident, a 
counter-intelligence officer was arrested for beating a suspect. End 
Summary 
 
¶2. (SBU) In mid-April of this year eight third country national 
employees of the U.S. company Dyncorps, contracted by the U.S. 
Department of State for construction and training programs in 
Southern Sudan, were taken into custody at the Sudan People's 
Liberation Army (SPLA) headquarters located in Juba.  These 
individuals are employed by Dyncorp to provide services and training 
to the SPLA.  This group, along with 16 SPLA soldiers, were 
suspected of stealing the SPLA April payroll of approximately 
400,000 Sudanese Pounds (about US $200,000). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Upon learning of the arrests, the US Consul General visited 
the SPLA headquarters to investigate the facts behind the case, and 
was successful in persuading the SPLA to release four of the 
detainees after a week of detention.  The other four, however, were 
relocated to a detention facility in the western part of Juba known 
as "Customs Market."  Two of these individuals allege they were 
forced to stay inside large windowless metal containers without 
lights while enduring the noise of individuals beating on the sides. 
 During their period of incarceration at this facility these two 
detainees also allege they were taken to a local cemetery next to 
the Nile River where they claim they were beaten and sodomized with 
a foreign object.  Other maltreatments allegedly include mock 
executions and the receipt of false information that the rest of 
their party had been executed.  Three of the four detainees were 
ultimately moved to a separate location in the vicinity of SPLA 
headquarters where they allegedly received more humane treatment, to 
include obtaining food three times a day from their employer. 
Dyncorps also was allowed to have a doctor examine the detainees 
periodically, who reported back to the Consul General at the time 
that they were in fair condition, although they showed signs of 
having been caned and shackled.  The fourth detainee, however, 
allegedly remained shackled with his arms raised above his head in 
what has been described by him as a "torturous position."  Food 
deliveries to this individual were alleged to have been more 
inconsistent. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Upon further notification of this continuing detainment, 
the acting U.S. Consul General in Juba lodged additional complaints 
with the SPLA leadership and the Southern Sudan Police Service 
(SSPS) Inspector General.  The SSPS was not aware of these arrests 
prior to these complaints.  The SSPS Inspector General, in turn, 
lodged formal complaints with the SPLA and the Southern Sudan Human 
Rights Commission on the grounds that the SPLA, a military 
organization, had no mandate to hold civilians. 
 
¶5. (SBU) One day after these complaints were made the remaining 
detainee at the Customs Market detention facility was reunited with 
the other three.  Following additional contact with the SPLA Chief 
of Staff by the U.S. Consulate General, all were released on house 
arrest.  These detainees were of Kenyan and Ugandan nationality. 
All the detainees are currently still in Juba and are now continuing 
their work for Dyncorps.  It is not clear whether they are free to 
leave Sudan at this time or whether they have been formally 
charged. 
 
¶6. (SBU) A separate event involving the abuse of a detainee resulted 
in the arrest of a SPLA intelligence officer.  According to a member 
of the SPLA counter-intelligence unit, a SPLA captain was detained 
after it was discovered that he had beaten a foreign national 
suspected of belonging to a terrorist group.  It is reported that 
the suspect was beaten so badly that he required hospitalization. 
His present condition is reported to be satisfactory. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment: Post is extremely concerned about these abuses by 
the SPLA, not only because they were directed at a US contractor, 
but also because they show the extent to which the SPLA takes 
matters into its own hands without informing civilian authorities or 
following due process.  CG Juba will continue to follow up with the 
SPLA and the GOSS to see whether any formal charges were filed or a 
proper investigation was conducted, and whether the soldiers 
involved in these incidents have been disciplined.
