¶1.  (SBU) Summary: IDF soldiers shot and killed four 
Palestinians in two separate incidents December 8-9 while the 
men were attempting to smuggle weapons across the 
Gaza-Egyptian border at Rafah.  A fifth Palestinian was 
seriously wounded.  In addition to the small number of 
laborers being allowed to enter Israel at Erez, the IDF 
decided December 9 to allow national staff of UN 
organizations, with prior approval from the IDF, to cross at 
Erez in vehicles rather than on foot.  In the West Bank, the 
IDF demolished December 8 a house in the village of al-Jib 
north of Jerusalem for lacking a building permit, and 
arrested at least nine Palestinians during arrest operations 
in the West Bank, including a PFLP activist in Ramallah.  End

-- Deaths: UNRWA reported that IDF soldiers shot and killed 
four Palestinians, reportedly all armed, in two incidents 
overnight December 8-9 as the Palestinians attempting to 
smuggle weapons across the Gaza-Egyptian border at Rafah.  A 
fifth Palestinian was seriously wounded, according to the

60-year-old man in the leg over December 8-9 when he wandered 
too close to Netzarim settlement.  The man was widely known 
to be mentally disabled, according to UNRWA. 
 
-- Mortars/Rockets: The IDF reported that a total of five 
mortar shells were fired at Israeli settler and IDF targets 
in the Gaza Strip December 8-9, and two anti-tank missiles 
were fired at Nissanit settlement December 8, according to 
the IDF.

launched a total of three shooting attacks December 8-9, two 
near Rafah and one near Neve Dekalim.

safely disposed of an IED discovered near an IDF outpost

¶8.  (SBU) BORDER CROSSINGS: 
 
-- Route Four (Salahadeen Road), the main north-south traffic 
artery, was open December 9, with a major detour at Netzarim 
Junction. 
 
-- Erez Crossing was open for internationals and for a 
limited number of Palestinians December 8, and 237 
agricultural laborers and 64 merchants crossed.  UNRWA 
reported that the IDF will now allow national staff of UN 
organizations to cross at Erez in vehicles, rather than on 
foot, with prior coordination through COGAT. 
 
-- The Erez Industrial Zone remained closed December 9. 
 
-- Sufa Crossing was closed for Palestinian laborers December 
9, but was open for the import of aggregates used in 
construction. 
 
-- Karni Terminal was open December 9, but reportedly 
operating slowly. 
 
-- Rafah Terminal was open for arrivals and departures 
December 9.  Although the IDF no longer prohibits the exit of 
male Palestinians age 16-35 from the Gaza Strip, lengthy 
checks at the border mean that few Palestinians in this 
category are actually able to exit.  There are no age 
restrictions for entry into Gaza. 
 
-- Tel al-Sultan checkpoint was open December 9.  Toufah 
checkpoint was open for residents of al-Mowassi.
