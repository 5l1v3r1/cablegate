¶2. (SBU)  SUMMARY.  The official death toll from Typhoon 
Morakot continues to rise, hitting 67 in the latest count, 
and estimated economic losses have mounted to at least USD276 
million in the agricultural sector alone.  Infrastructure 
repair work is continuing, and although significant recovery 
of power and telecommunications has occurred, access to safe 
drinking water is still a problem.  A/DIR presented the 
Taiwan Red Cross Society with a check for USD250,000 in 
typhoon relief funds (refs c and d).  Taiwan Red Cross 
Secretary-General Chen expressed great appreciation and said 
they will use this USAID/DCHA/OFDA commitment to support 
relief efforts across storm-ravaged regions in central and 
southern Taiwan.  END SUMMARY.

AIT Delivers Relief Funds 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Acting Director Robert Wang traveled to the 
headquarters of Taiwan's Red Cross Society on August 12 to 
present a check for USD250,000, which will be used to support 
the immediate relief needs of victims of Typhoon Morakot. 
Red Cross Secretary-General Chen Shi-kui expressed his 
gratitude for US support.  He added that while flood waters 
are receding, damage in mountainous areas remains severe. 
The Acting Director's call on the Red Cross was attended by 
local media, and AIT earlier in the day issued a press 
release regarding provision of USAID relief funds to Taiwan 
(available on AIT's intranet site). 
 
¶4. (SBU)  In addition to funds provided by USAID, Taiwan's 
Red Cross states it has received over USD5 million in 
donations from the public.  Local enterprises have donated an 
additional USD62.5 million through various organizations. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On the sidelines of the donation ceremony and media 
event, Red Cross Executive Director Chen requested USG 
assistance in resolving a technical issue that is preventing 
many potential donors in the United States (many of whom are 
Taiwanese-Americans) from making contributions to relief 
efforts.  The American Red Cross has not yet issued 
guidelines to local Red Cross chapters, instructing them to 
accept contributions designated for Taiwan.  Without such 
instructions, Chen said, chapters are unwilling to accept 
contributions or issue receipts.  Chen asked for U.S. 
assistance in conveying this request to Red Cross 
headquarters.  Issuing the guidelines would have no political 
implications, Chen said, noting that his PRC counterpart had 
contacted him earlier in the day to offer any possible 
cooperation and assistance.  The American Red Cross can 
contact Chen directly at skc0408@redcross.org.tw for 
additional information.  ACTION REQUEST: Please advise if 
Department is able to contact the American Red Cross to 
resolve this concern.

Deaths Mount as Clean-up Continues 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  The typhoon-related death toll as of the afternoon 
of August 12 stands at 67, with an additional 61 persons 
reported missing and 35 injured.  Three-quarters of the 
deaths recorded thus far occurred in Tainan and Kaohsiung 
Counties.  Road conditions are gradually improving in 
affected areas, although 118 roads and one national 
expressway are still awaiting repair.  750,000 households are 
still without access to safe drinking water, down from the 
nearly 1 million reported yesterday (ref b).  Power supply 
 
TAIPEI 00000974  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
has been restored to many affected households, as have 
telecommunications services, though there are still a 
combined total of 90,000 households without electricity or 
working telephones.  The number of individuals staying in 
temporary shelters has fallen since yesterday by about a 
quarter to roughly 8,000.  Search and rescue teams today plan 
to rescue the 10 remaining villagers known to be alive in 
Xiaolin Village, which was destroyed by a mudslide.  Rescue 
authorities are still unwilling to speculate or comment on 
the fate of hundreds of Xiaolin residents who are still 
unaccounted for. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  AIT/K reports that according to the Executive 
Yuan's Southern Taiwan Joint Service Center, rescue measures 
in mountainous areas throughout the south are hampered by 
broken bridges, destroyed roads, and broken 
telecommunications links.  While relief material has been 
flowing into affected areas over the past few days, there are 
difficulties getting them to the victims.  In Pingtung 
County, meanwhile, the main task facing relief workers is 
reportedly clearing out tons of dead poultry, fish, and pigs, 
in order to avoid disease outbreaks and environmental 
degradation.  Pingtung lacks the necessary incinerator 
capacity to destroy the cleared out livestock, but has 
sufficient manpower for environmental clean-up.  In Taitung 
County, the main focus of rescue and relief operations now is 
to drop food and material to isolated areas.  All southbound 
roads to Taitung have been reportedly cut-off by the typhoon, 
but northbound lanes are open.  The military has been helping 
augment Taitung's 164 member firefighter team in rescue and 
relief efforts.  Chiayi County reports that damage to the 
agricultural sector tripled since yesterdays estimate, 
reaching at least USD20 million, but rescue and relief 
efforts are proceeding smoothly now.  Tainan County contacts 
report that the situation there is stabilizing, and say they 
have enough material and manpower to deliver relief materials 
to local victims. 
 
¶8. (SBU)  Economic losses attributed to the typhoon continue 
to mount, now estimated at NTD8.85 billion (roughly USD276 
million) for the agriculture sector alone.  A total of 55,050 
hectares of farm land have been damaged, with the most severe 
losses accruing to banana, papaya, and lychee farms. 
Officials on the Council of Agriculture are anticipating a 
20-35 percent jump in the price of poultry and meat as a 
result of damage to those industries. 
 
----------------------------- 
State of Emergency Unlikely 
----------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU)  Press reports earlier today said that Premier Liu 
will meet with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang to discuss 
whether President Ma should declare a state of emergency in 
the wake of the typhoon due to the growing extent of damage 
being uncovered on a daily basis.  Both President Ma and the 
presidential office responded to these reports saying that 
there are no plans or need to declare a state of emergency.
