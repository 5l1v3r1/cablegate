¶1. (SBU) Summary: Following a year and a half of restoration 
work, the 10th century Armenian Akdamar Church was reopened in a 
March 29 ceremony attended by a GOAM delegation and members of 
the diplomatic establishment from Ankara, as well as members of 
Turkey's Armenian population.  In opening remarks, Culture 
Minister Koc said the reopening of the church as a memorial 
museum was to perpetuate world culture.   Armenian Patriarch for 
Istanbul and all of Turkey Mesrob II saw the opening as a 
positive development in Turkish-Armenian relations and called 
for annual use of the church as a pilgrimage destination and 
festival site and place for a Holy Liturgy, paving the way for 
dialogue between Turkey and Armenia.  The GOT maintains that 
Akdamar will remain a museum but is considering Mesrob's request 
that it display a cross.  End summary. 
 
Akdamar Reopens as a Museum 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On March 29, the ancient Armenian Akdamar Church, also 
known as Surp Khach or Holy Cross, located on a small island on 
Lake Van in southestern Turkey, was reopened and designated as a 
monument museum after an 18 month long GOT-funded, YTL 2.6 
million (USD 1.9 million) restoration project, led by an 
Armenian architect.. 
Armenian Deputy Culture Minister Gagik Gyurjyan led a 20-member 
Armenian delegation to the reopening celebration, which included 
Turkey's Armenian Patriarch Mesrob II, as well as other 
Armenians who traveled to Turkey from Yerevan for the occasion. 
The U.S. Charge and Ambassadors from Israel, Germany and other 
countries also attended the ceremony, for which the GOT provided 
a chartered aircraft from Ankara.  Archbishops Museg 
Mardirosyian and Sempad Lapaciyan from Los Angeles, and Hacag 
Barsamyan from New York also participated.  Earlier in the week, 
the head of the Armenian Orthodox Church, Karekin II, refused to 
attend the reopening because the church will operate as a 
museum, and not as a holy place. 
 
Koc:  Perpetuating Cultural Heritage While Keeping Politics and 
Religion Separate 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
----------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) In opening remarks at the ceremony, entitled "Respect 
the History, Respect the Culture," Turkish Minister of Culture 
and Tourism Atilla Koc emphasized Turkey's rich "cultural 
geography in which different cultures have blended" throughout 
history.  Using the official GOT-designated name and spelling 
["Aghtamar" is the alternative spelling preferred by Armenians] 
of the church, Koc said that "the main purpose of the 
restoration of Van Akdamar Church Memorial Museum is to 
perpetuate a world cultural heritage."  Koc later told the press 
that the opening was intended as an exercise in good will, an 
effort to show that Turkey bears no ill will toward Armenians 
despite many political problems.  Koc emphasized that he was 
trying to do his best to maintain a separation between the 
political and the sacred. 
 
Patriarch: Positive Development in Turkish-Armenian Relations 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Striking a conciliatory note in his remarks, and "on 
behalf of the Armenian citizens of Turkey," Patriarch Mesrob II 
offered "profound thanks" to the GOT for completing the 
restoration "despite much harsh and politicized criticism from 
various opponents."  He emphasized that the restoration work was 
"a positive development in Turkish-Armenian relations, which I 
hope will be blessed by the efforts of all people of good will." 
 The Patriarch called for the church to become "the focal point 
of an annual pilgrimage," wherein "a special Divine Liturgy" 
could be held once a year, and "an Aghtamar Festival linked to 
it," to someday "pave the way for the longed-for dialogue, which 
both sides have not achieved to date." 
 
Comment 
---------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) While the mood of the ceremony was positive, some 
Turkish commentators noted that the Van Provincial Governor 
neglected to welcome the Armenian delegation or Mesrob II in his 
opening remarks.  The press also noted that no one from the 
Armenian delegation from Yerevan was asked to speak at the 
ceremony.  Going forward, critics will undoubtedly focus on the 
request by the Armenian clergy to affix a cross to the church, 
which various ministries in Ankara are currently considering. 
For the moment, however, the GOT has earned some goodwill by 
committing the resources to refurbish the site and by hosting a 
high-level ceremony focused on cultural, political and spiritual
