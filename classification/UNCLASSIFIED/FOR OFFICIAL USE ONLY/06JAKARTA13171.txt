¶1. (SBU) After learning that the entire staff of the 
Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs Multilateral Affairs 
Directorate was either in New York or otherwise unavailable, 
we met November 9 with Harry Purwanto, Department of Foreign 
Affairs (DFA) Director for North and Central America, to urge 
the Government of Indonesia to support Australia's amendment 
to the UNGA Cuba Embargo resolution (refs A, B) and to 
support specific UNGA country resolutions with regards to 
human rights (ref C). 
 
¶2. (SBU)  We had faxed the talking points on the Cuba embargo 
to the DFA on November 8 so that that the Ministry could 
coordinate the matter with the Indonesian Mission to te UN in 
a timely manner.  However, we reviewed the matter with 
Purwanto again.  He took our concerns on board and agreed to 
share them within the DFA. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We also shared our views on upcoming 
country-specific UNGA Third Committee human rights 
resolutions (ref C).  Purwanto reiterated the GOI's 
longstanding opposition in principle to country-specific 
resolutions, stating that the GOI preferred to address human 
rights issues by means of thematic resolutions.  We urged the 
GOI to rethink its approach to this matter.  We pointed out 
that Indonesia, which has just been elected to the Security 
Council, is a large country that should exert more moral and 
political leadership internationally, and it can hardly do 
this by opposing resolutions condemning regimes as odious as 
the one currently in power in the DPRK, to name one example. 
Purwanto accepted our points and agreed to coordinate them 
within the DFA.
