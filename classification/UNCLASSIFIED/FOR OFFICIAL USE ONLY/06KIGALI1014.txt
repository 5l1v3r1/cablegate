REF: KIGALI 984 
 
¶1. (U) A Joint Partner Implementation Support Mission of the 
partners of the Multi-Country Demobilization and 
Reintegration Program (MDRP) for the Great Lakes regions held 
a three day conference in Kigali 4-6 October to review and 
assess the progress made in implementing the program and key 
complimentary activities in Rwanda.  Efforts to reintegrate 
ex-combatants in Rwanda are generally proceeding well, the 
relatively low number of 575 returnees in 2006 is attributed 
to the difficulty the prospective returnees have separating 
from their armed group leadership not the willingness and 
capability of Rwanda to accept them. End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Background.  The MDRP funds disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programs in seven 
central African countries including Rwanda and the DRC. In 
Rwanda, the focus of its effort is the Rwanda Demobilization 
and Reintegration Program (RDRC).  The USG does not directly 
fund the MDRP. End background. 
 
¶3. (U) The principle objectives of the mission were to assess 
progress in the implementation of demobilization and 
reintegration activities under the RDRC; asses the 
effectiveness of the RDRC in facilitating the demobilization 
and reintegration of members of armed groups of Rwandan 
origin from the DRC; review the MDRP's assistance for special 
target groups (women, children and disabled); and provide 
guidance for the ongoing mid-term review of the MDRP and the 
upcoming review of the MDRP.  The conference also included 
briefs by German Development Cooperation GTZ and an 
independent analyst's presentation on the Democratic Forces 
of the Liberation of Rwanda (reftel). 
 
¶4. (U) Since 1997, the RDRC has been the lead GOR agency in 
the efforts to demobilize an estimated 45,000 ex-combatants 
from the Rwandan Defense Forces (RDF), an estimated 22,500 
members of Armed Groups (AGs) and support their transition 
into civilian society.  (Note.  The initial estimate of 
22,500 has since been changed to an estimated 8,000 to 
10,000.  End note.)  The RDCR works with other GOR 
ministries- Immigration, Health, Defense and Local 
Government- in a joint committee to oversee and support the 
integration of ex-combatants and dependents into society. 
According to the RDRC, the total program numbers: 
 
-- Ex-RDF  1997-2005: 18,805             2006: 1,234 
-- Ex-FAR  1997-2005: 12,290            2006: 679 
-- Ex-AGs  1997-2005: 5,087              2006: 439 
-- Ex-AGs (Children) 1997-2005: 570 2006: 30 
(Note.  The Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR) statistics reflect 
soldiers of the former government who did not flee to DRC and 
join the FDLR.  End note.) 
 
¶5.  (U) The RDRC's communication plan, with the assistance of 
MDRP consultants, has several broad objectives.  In order to 
communicate the demobilization/reintegration message to 
combatants, dependents, and families, the plan calls for the 
use of a combination of radio, print (newsletters and 
leaflets), theater and video.  Radio is the primary means to 
reach the target audience, and it was noted that Voice of 
America and BBC were more trusted by the target audience than 
the UN,s Radio Okapi or Radio Rwanda.  Additional goals of 
the communication plan are to influence word of mouth from 
dependents, civil society, the international community and 
the government and communicate demobilization and 
reintegration successes to stakeholders such as donors, UN 
agencies, NGOs and the public. 
 
¶6.  (U) The German Development Cooperation GTZ has a 
vocational training program that prepares ex-combatants for 
reintegration.  Since 2004, the project has trained 655 
ex-combatants in general business and management skills and 
290 in vocational skills such as house construction and 
plumbing.  Program coordinator Wolfgang Ahrens reported that 
the program was very successful noting, however, that it was 
relatively expensive and did not benefit the majority of the 
ex-combatants. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  Comment. The conference reinforced the fact that 
the GOR, with significant assistance from the MDRP, continues 
to run a relatively efficient demobilization and 
reintegration program.  Some familiar accusations were made 
regarding MONUC's ineffectiveness at accepting and processing 
combatants willing to return to Rwanda and its failure to 
militarily pursue the FDLR effectively.  As usual, the 
general consensus among the GOR officials, UN and Bank 
 
representatives and the diplomats in attendance was that the 
key to the process is separating the vast majority of those 
FDLR combatants who are willing to return to Rwanda from the 
small, hard core leadership.  Said leadership, while possibly 
recognizing that its political objectives in Rwanda are 
unobtainable, has no motivation to return and so will 
continue to exercise tight control over the general FDLR 
ranks.  End comment.
