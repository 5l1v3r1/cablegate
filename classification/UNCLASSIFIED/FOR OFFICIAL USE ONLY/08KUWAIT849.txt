¶1. (SBU)  During their July 22 meeting (ref B), Ambassador 
raised with Minister of Interior Shaykh Jaber Khaled al-Jaber 
Al Sabah opening an alternate route for U.S. military convoys 
provisioning Iraq's Camp Bucca.  The current route exits 
Kuwait at the Khabari crossing and follows a parallel road 
135 km along the Kuwait-Iraqi border.  Historically one 
portion of this road has accounted for a significant percent 
of all IED attacks.  Ambassador noted that we were no longer 
requesting that a new border opening be created at Bucca; 
however, allowing the convoys to travel internally and use 
the Abdaly-Safwan crossing area would enable them to reduce 
significantly both travel time and IED exposure.  Ambassador 
advised that this request had been passed in writing with 
supporting diagrams and maps to MFA U/S Jarallah during their 
July 15 meeting (ref A).  The number of convoys would be 
limited to three or so per week for a period of approximately 
18 months. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Shaykh Jaber had not yet received the package from 
the MFA, but said he would study the request.  The Minister 
reaffirmed the GoK's opposition to opening a new crossing at 
Bucca.  (Note: Embassy forwarded a copy of the package 
separately following Ambassador's meeting.  End Note.) 
 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Embassy will continue to follow up on this request.
