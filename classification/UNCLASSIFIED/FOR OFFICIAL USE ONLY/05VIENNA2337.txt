¶1.  (SBU) On July 11, we raised ref (a) points with Lydia 
Saadat, the head of Planning and Program Activities for Asia, 
the Middle East, Latin America and the Mediterranean in the 
Austrian Foreign Ministry's Development Cooperation section. 
Saadat told us that the Austrian Ambassador to Jordan would 
represent the GoA at the July 18-19 meeting of the 
International Reconstruction Trust Fund Facility for Iraq 
(IRFFI) at Jordan's Dead Sea Convention Center. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Saadat reviewed Austria's assistance commitments 
and disbursements, and said Austria does not plan to make an 
additional pledge at the Dead Sea Donors' Meeting.  An 
Austrian MFA paper stresses the following points: 
 
--  Austria's commitment to Iraq's development includes 
bilateral technical assistance and capacity building. 
 
--  Austria has increased its commitment in terms of 
technical assistance from 1.7 million Euros to 2.1 million 
Euros.  Of this amount, Austria has disbursed 1.5 million 
Euros to projects. 
 
--  The sum of 10 million Euros which Austria made available 
for credit guarantees "is crucially connected to the further 
progress of the stabilisation and peace process." 
 
--  The Austrian Interior Ministry's contribution to police 
training is part of Austria's capacity building effort.  (Ref 
b discusses Interior Ministry plans to extend the police 
training mission in Jordan to the end of 2006.) 
 
--  Debt relief is a major part of Austria's commitment to 
Iraqi reconstruction.  Austria plans to forgive some 1.16 
billion Euros in Iraqi debt.  (Note:  Austrian officials 
point out that this figure amounts to approximately 1 percent 
of Austria's Gross Domestic Product.  End note.) 
 
--  The paper notes, "In general, the realisation and 
progress of projects and commitments are subjectd to 
political development and stability of the security situation 
allowing Austrian and local experts to work without excessive 
risk to their health and lives.  The stabilisation of the 
security situation is the prime prerequisite for the 
successful implementation of Austria's assistance measures."
