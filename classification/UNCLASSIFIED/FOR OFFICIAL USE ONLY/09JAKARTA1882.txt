SUBJECT: ENHANCING US-INDONESIA PARTNERSHIP THROUGH SCIENCE 
ENGAGEMENT 
 
Ref: Jakarta 1473 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Post proposes a long-term science engagement 
strategy based upon three pillars:  1) upgrading Indonesia's science 
capacity through joint research that will provide ongoing mentoring 
relationships and connections to the U.S. science community; 2) 
assisting the recognition and development of the necessary soft 
infrastructure for S&T to flourish; and 3) building a 
knowledge-based society from education in science.  Concluding the 
S&T Agreement currently under negotiation prior to the visit of 
recently named Science Envoy Dr. Bruce Alberts would demonstrate the 
seriousness that both sides attach to this aspect of our bilateral 
cooperation.  An S&T Agreement establishes credibility for any new 
science engagement strategy.  End Summary. 
 
---------------- 
VISION STATEMENT 
---------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) To use benefits derived from science and technology 
cooperation to guide Indonesia's progress towards further economic 
well-being and democratic reform. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
PILLAR ONE: BUILDING SCIENCE CAPACITY 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Increased scientific exchanges and joint research 
collaboration forms the core of this pillar.  Activities could take 
place through existing cooperation or new projects such as the 
Global Science Corps.  The impact of the activities is directly 
proportional to the number of participating U.S. scientists and 
length of stay in Indonesia. 
 
- Developing the next generation of Indonesian scientists through 
programs such as Fulbright or university-based programs; 
 
- Identifying research areas and activities of mutual interest to 
American and Indonesian scientists such as climate change, marine 
fisheries and link to food security, ocean exploration and other 
areas; 
 
Note: For successful long-term engagement on ocean and marine 
research, both sides must ensure a successful mid-2010 exploration 
visit of NOAA's Okeanos Explorer. 
 
 
------------------------------ ---------------------- 
PILLAR TWO - POLICY: BUILDING SOFT S&T INFRASTRUCTURE 
------------------------------ ---------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Science Envoy and delegation could begin the first in a 
possible series of discussions in Indonesia that would both assess 
the situation and identify potential technical assistance 
opportunities. 
 
- Engage the Ministry of Research and Technology (MRT) in a series 
of discussions to identify blockages and potential solutions to 
develop a pro-science and innovation policy and regulatory 
environment; 
 
- Science academies and other non-government stakeholders on both 
sides could carry on similar discussions in parallel or integrated 
with the discussions with MRT; 
 
- After 6 months of cooperation and discussions, both sides could 
decide if a regular S&T dialogue should be launched; 
 
- Placement of one or two short-term science policy experts inside 
the MRT or other appropriate government science policy agency to 
assist Indonesia in shaping science policies and practices that 
encourage and foster a culture of innovation (removing laws that 
inhibit cooperation, providing incentives for innovations, etc.).

PILLAR THREE: CREATING A KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY 
-------------------------- --------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Supporting education and centers of excellence, including 
through emphasizing science in existing Embassy USAID and Public 
Affairs Section (PAS) programs: 
 
- Elementary, secondary, and technical school 
science/math/technology education and training (USAID); 
 
- Increasing the number of PhD scientists; 
 
- Fostering cooperation and scientific exchanges between US and 
Indonesian educational institutions (PAS/USAID); 
 
- Creating centers of scientific excellence such as the Center of 
Excellence on Sustainable Ocean Fisheries (see reftel for 
proposal). 
 
-------------------------------------- 
IMMEDIATE ACTIVITIES FOR SCIENCE ENVOY 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Post understands that Dr. Bruce Alberts, Science Envoy, is 
considering a visit to Indonesia in January 2010.  This coincides 
closely with the 100th day of President Yudhoyono's new 
administration.  Our key counterpart likely will be the Ministry of 
Research and Technology (MRT), given its coordinating role and 
permitting authority on science and technology related activities 
and policy. Possible ideas for a 3-day visit include: 
 
- Presidential Lecture hosted and attended by President Yudhoyono; 
 
- Meet with key science contacts i.e. MRT, Agency for the Assessment 
and Application of Technology (BPPT), the Indonesian Institute of 
Sciences (LIPI), Habibie Center, the Indonesian Academy of Science, 
Ministry of Education; 
 
- Science round table with key Indonesian scientists, policy makers, 
think tanks, and private sector; 
 
- Possible S&T MOU signing ceremony; 
 
- Outreach to key universities, i.e. University of Indonesia in 
Jakarta, Hasanuddin University in Makassar, Airlangga University in 
Surabaya, Gajah Madah University in Yogyakarta, and Institute of 
Technology Bandung; 
 
- Press event/interview. 
 
------------------ 
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS 
------------------ 
 
¶7. (SBU) We envision the implementation of this science engagement 
strategy as a gradual process, initially building on existing 
programs and expanding as the S&T landscape is better defined 
through an assessment process.  Benchmarks during Year 1 include: 
 
- Signing an S&T Agreement before end of January 2010; 
 
- GOI agreeing to series of discussions and activities launched by 
the Science Envoy, including science exchanges and prioritizing 
areas of joint research; 
 
- Conducting S&T needs assessment; 
 
- Identifying technical assistance to address policy environment for 
science and technology. 
 
------------------ 
POTENTIAL PARTNERS 
------------------ 
 
¶8. (SBU) Our key GOI counterpart is the MRT with other partners such 
as BPPT, LIPI, and the Indonesian Academy of Science.  Key science 
 
JAKARTA 00001882  003 OF 003 
 
 
leaders with direct channels to the Presidential Palace include 
Director of the Eijkman Institute Dr. Sangkot Marzuki, Chairman of 
LIPI Dr. Umar Jenie, and BPPT Chairman Dr. Marzan Iskander. 
Depending on areas of cooperation, other important partners include 
the Ministries of Environment, Forestry, Fisheries, Health, 
Agriculture, Education, Communications, Finance, Foreign Affairs, 
and the Central Planning Agency. 
 
-------------------- 
S&T CHALLENGES AHEAD 
-------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) If Indonesia is to become a regional democratic and 
economic powerhouse driven by rational science-based policies, it 
must prioritize investment in and application of science and 
technology capacity.  Indonesia faces many challenges in the science 
and technology sector.  The simple lack of science capacity stands 
out most clearly.  A legal and policy environment unfriendly to 
research and commercialization, lack of science-based approach to 
policy-making, and a seniority-based culture limit the emergence of 
a stronger innovative society in Indonesia.  Furthermore, due to a 
long history of foreign occupation, suspicion of international 
engagement can rise up - spurred on by media attention - and create 
political challenges.  In 2006, the health minister took an extreme 
position to block all cooperation with foreigners on H5N1 virus 
sample sharing on the basis that Indonesia owned the genetic rights 
of viruses from which foreign pharmaceutical companies develop 
vaccines.  Sample sharing has not resumed, and cooperation on 
biomedical research with the United States remains chilled. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Dr. Bruce Alberts' visit to Indonesia as Science Envoy 
provides an opportunity to highlight and deepen our collaboration on 
science and technology at the outset of President Yudhoyono's new 
administration.  However, key to building our future relationship is 
the signing of the S&T Agreement.  Absence of this agreement limits 
future collaboration.
