SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED -- PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The Kurdistan Regional Government swore in its new 
unified cabinet May 7, the  major step in its path towards full 
unification.  Until now, the KRG had rival cabinets in Erbil 
(dominated by the Kurdistan Democratic Party) and in 
Sulaymaniyah (dominated by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan). 
Creating eight new regional ministries, the new ministry lineup 
largely matches that in Baghdad.  The extra ministerial slots 
also helped let the parties avoid losing many cabinet seats as 
they merged two complete cabinets into one.  In unscripted 
remarks before he began his speech, PM Barzani said the large 
number of ministries (27) was "transitional" and would later 
drop. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Revealing one KRG priority, the KRG has created a 
Natural Resources ministry to deal with oil.  In his speech, PM 
Barzani (highlights septel) mentioned territories Saddam had 
removed from Kurdish control and that the KRG wants to reclaim 
through law.  To pursue this, the KRG has now named the KDP's 
Mohammed Ihsan, the former Erbil minister for human rights, to 
be "Minister for Areas outside the Kurdistan Region" (they did 
not create a ministry). 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Four KRG ministries are not expected to unify for a 
year: Interior, Finance, Justice and Peshmerga (defense). 
Interior and finance will keep the same ministers.  PUK and KDP 
each have named new justice ministers and Peshmerga ministers. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The new cabinet has 42 members, only six fewer than 
the two rival cabinets combined.  The parties took the 
opportunity to bring in fresh blood: well over half of the 
members are new.  Two new ministers were senior PUK Peshmerga 
commanders.  Smaller parties complain that they deserve more 
cabinet slots.  The KDP and PUK remain firmly in control, but 
each did agree to give up 7 and 4 ministerial slots 
respectively.  Smaller parties almost than doubled their 
representation, going from 6 slots to 11.  Almost all the non 
KDP or PUK ministers are new; the Turcomans and Christians come 
from different parties than in the last cabinet.  Yezidi and 
Faili Kurds both joined the cabinet.  Although PM Barzani 
mentioned women's rights in his speech, he appointed only 3 to 
his cabinet: the previous rival cabinets had at least 3 women 
each.  The three women unified cabinet ministers are Chinar 
Sa'ad Abdullah, Minister for Martyrs and Anfal Victims, Nazanin 
Mohammad Waso, Minister for Municipalities, and Dr. Jinan Qasim, 
a minister without portfolio.

Unified Ministers Not in Outgoing Cabinets (i.e., new 
ministers): 25 
 
¶6.  (U)  Newly Created Ministries/Portfolios: 
 
(U)  The new cabinet creates eight ministries by splitting in 
two four previously combined ministries: "Industry and Energy," 
"Transportation and Communication," "Municipalities and 
Tourism," and "Human Rights, Anfal Victims and Refugees."  One 
half of the "Industry and Energy" ministry becomes the new 
"Natural Resources" ministry to deal with oil.  Another newly 
emerging, separate ministry is for "Martyrs and Anfal Victims." 
 
KIRKUK 00000113  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
 
(U)  The KRG also created six wholly new ministries: 
 Water Resources 
 Planning 
 Electricity 
 Sports and Youth 
 Trade 
 Environment. 
A KDP minister was named, but no ministry established, for 
"Affairs of Kurdistani Areas outside the KRG" (to push for other 
Kurdish areas to join the KRG, such as Kirkuk). 
 
(SBU)  The KRG abolished its "Cooperation" ministries, which 
Baghdad reportedly had complained about as proto-MFAs.
