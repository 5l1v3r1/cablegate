SUBJECT: Senegal-Former National Assembly Chairman Creates his own 
Party 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: On December 2, the recently ousted Chairman of the 
National Assembly, Macky Sall, called a press conference at the 
Hotel Teranga to announce the creation of his party.  He announced 
that his new party is APR-Yakaar (Alliance for the Republic and the 
Wolof word for hope-Yakaar).  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) In announcing his new party Sall remarked that Senegal is at 
crossroads and it was necessary to "dare to take a new turn to 
create a democratic and free Senegal where people are thirsty for 
change."  He then revealed that "Work, Solidarity and Dignity" was 
the motto of his party and he called for an ethical revival to 
confront the country's economic and political crisis.  He denounced 
the underutilization of human resources in Senegal and called for "a 
new leadership based on dialogue and consensus that banishes 
arrogance and violence," thus indirectly criticizing Wade's 
government without naming him. 
 
¶3. (U) The principal conference room that he used ended up being too 
small for the thousand plus people that came and many were packed in 
adjoining conference rooms and corridors in what was a festive 
atmosphere.  Leading opposition parties were represented at the 
launching ceremony including Madieyna Diouf, the number two of AFP 
(Alliance of the Forces of Progress) and Oumar Sarr, one the closest 
aides of former Prime Minister Idrissa Seck, who, like Sall, was 
ousted and then cut ties with the ruling party to prepare for Wade's 
succession.  The dominant slogan of his supporters was "Macky 
President," underlining that Sall is determined to fight his way to 
the presidency.
