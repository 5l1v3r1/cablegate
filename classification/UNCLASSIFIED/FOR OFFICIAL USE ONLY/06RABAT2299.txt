SUBJECT: GLOBAL INITIATIVE TO COMBAT NUCLEAR TERRORISM: 
DRAFT PLAN OF WORK AND DRAFT AGENDA FOR FEBRUARY 2007 
MEETING IN ANKARA, TURKEY 
 
REF: SECSTATE 198296 
 
¶1. (SBU) Ambassador joined with Russian ambassador to present 
GI agenda and other information reftel December 13 to MFA 
Secretary-General Omar Hilale, who led the Moroccan 
 
SIPDIS 
delegation at the Initial Partners meeting in Rabat.   Hilale 
confirmed that Morocco would attend the Ankara meeting but 
was not sure yet who would go.  He did not think they would 
be able to provide any response on activities until after 
December 18, but would endeavor to provide something as soon 
as possible, certainly before the second deadline.  Hilale 
asked whether the roster of partners in Ankara would be the 
same as in Rabat; the Russian Ambassador replied in the 
affirmative. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Polcouns reviewed points with MFA IO Director Nasser 
Bourita December 15.  Bourita confirmed that Morocco would 
attend.  He asked specifically whether any other countries 
than those at the Rabat meeting would be invited at this 
stage.  He appreciated receipt of demarche but regretted that 
they had not yet received an invitation from Turkey. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Turkish Embassy representatives later told us they 
had received no information on the Ankara conference, nor any 
invitation to pass to the Moroccans. 
 
¶4. (U) Embassy POC for the Ankara meeting will be POLMILOFF 
Marcel Martinez.  Martinez is on leave until January 8; in 
his absence any questions will be handled by POL staff.
