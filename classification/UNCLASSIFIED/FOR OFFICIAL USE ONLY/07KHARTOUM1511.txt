SUBJECT: HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES WATCH SECURITY SITUATION 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) On September 20, a convoy of two humanitarian 
vehicles were ambushed by unknown assailants in South Darfur 
on the main road between Nyala and Kass.  Eight members of 
the NGO World Vision International (WVI), a USAID funded NGO, 
were in the convoy.   The vehicles, clearly marked as 
humanitarian, were fired upon by two armed men who attacked 
the vehicles with automatic weapons, World Vision 
International Operations Director Mario Rodrigues told 
poloff.  Three WVI staffers were wounded. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On September 24, Rodrigues said that there were no 
fatalities but one of the three wounded remained in critical 
condition.  He added that the attackers proceeded to rob the 
wounded and other passengers, but when a third unknown 
vehicle approached the ambush site, the attackers fled 
leaving the WVI vehicles.  This attempted hijacking comes 
within a week after a hijacking at gunpoint of a WVI vehicle. 
 There were no injuries during this hijacking. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Separately, on September 25, local media claimed 
that the OXFAM Country Program Manager Caroline Nursey 
"threatened" to pull out of Darfur over deteriorating 
security conditions.  Nursey told poloff that the local press 
reports are simply "not true" and misquoted her recent BBC 
interview.  She told the BBC interviewer that several months 
ago, when security problems were at a peak, OXFAM prepared 
contingency plans to reduce operations and assessed its then 
current operational profile, concluding that while at the 
level of "extreme risk," OXFAM would remain because of the 
high level of need.  Nursey added that in the past two to 
three weeks, the situation has again deteriorated.  "We are 
keeping watch on this." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: In the past two weeks, coinciding with the 
ending of the rainy season, observers believe there is a 
discernible up-tick in armed attacks on civilians, 
particularly in Darfur.  UN reports state that attacks 
against relief workers nationwide have increased by 150 
percent over last year.   Observers believe that armed 
bandits, with the ending of the rainy season and before the 
deployment of the UN hybrid military force, might continue 
their raids on civilians and humanitarian workers alike.   On 
September 24, the High Level Committee on Humanitarian Aid, 
as part of their regular meeting, noted among other issues 
the recent rise in security related incidents.  Justice and 
Equality Movement (JEM) leader Dr. Khalil Ibrahim said on 
September 26 that his group plans to continue fighting up to, 
and through the upcoming Darfur peace talks.  End Comment.
