VOTE 
 
REF: STATE 54944 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) Post delivered reftel demarche on the upcoming vote 
on Kosovo's application to join the World Bank (WB) on June 2 
to Godfrey Magwenzi, the head of Multi-Lateral Affairs at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Magwenzi explained that while 
Zimbabwe was supportive of Kosovo's application to join the 
WB, it was his country's position to wait until the 
International Court of Justice (ICJ) completed its ruling to 
determine the status of Kosovo's statehood, before voting in 
favor of entry into the WB.  Poloff asked Magwenzi to 
reconsider because an abstention may block Kosovo's WB 
application due to quorom requirements.  Despite this, we 
expect Zimbabwe to abstain.
