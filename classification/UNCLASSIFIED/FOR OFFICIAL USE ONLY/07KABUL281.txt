¶1.  (U) At approximately 11:50 a.m. on January 26, a suicide 
body-borne improvised explosive device detonated outside of 
USAID's Alternative Livelihoods Program (ALP/S) compound in 
the center of Lashkar Gah.  According to Global Security, who 
handle security for ALP/S, the bomber approached the entrance 
and tried to gain access to the compound, claiming he had an 
item (envelope or package) to deliver to an unspecified 
person within.  A local guard force shift commander grew 
suspicious and challenged the individual.  An argument ensued 
and the individual did not heed a warning to stop, whereon 
the guard shot the bomber in the chest.  While lying on the 
ground, the bomber detonated the IED, killing himself and 
inflicting shrapnel wounds to the guard.  Though press 
reports have referred to a policeman (likely a reference to 
the guard) and two civilians being injured, Global reported 
no other injuries.  The guard received immediate treatment by 
the Global medics and was sent to a local hospital. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In an announcement on local radio in the afternoon, 
Provincial Police Chief General Nabi Jan Mullahkhel confirmed 
the attack.  The announcement reported that, according to the 
police department,s investigation, the suicide bomber was 
not Afghan.
