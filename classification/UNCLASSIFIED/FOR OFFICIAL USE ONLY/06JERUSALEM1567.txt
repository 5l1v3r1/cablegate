¶1.    (SBU) Summary.  In what may appear to be an escalating 
war of words, Hamas officials, including PM Isma'il Haniyyah, 
April 14-16 lashed out at U.S., European, and Israeli efforts 
to isolate and undermine the new Hamas-led government.  In 
comments before tens of thousands of Muslim worshippers in 
Gaza on April 14, Haniyyah vowed that Palestinians would 
never submit in the face of international actions to cut off 
financial assistance.  Haniyyah made similar statements 
during a meeting with Palestinian factional representatives 
on April 16 where he warned of "total chaos" if his 
government is brought down.  Comments by Haniyyah and others 
have also indirectly attacked Palestinian Authority (PA) 
President Abbas and Fatah.  End summary. 
 
PM Haniyyah Warns 
Of "Total Chaos" 
----------------- 
 
¶2.    (SBU) During Friday prayers April 14 in the Gaza Strip, 
Hamas PM Isma'il Haniyyah told tens of thousands of 
worshippers that Palestinians were not intimidated by the 
international community's decision to halt financial 
assistance to the PA.  Haniyyah, who has been previously 
known for his relatively measured public statements, lashed 
out that Palestinians would not submit to this form of 
pressure, adding that "we (Palestinians) are ready to eat 
only salt and olives" if necessary.  In his comments, 
Haniyyah directed implicit criticism at PA President Mahmud 
Abbas by noting that Haniyyah is no "stooge" to outside 
interests.  Haniyyah also charged that Abbas had withdrawn 
powers of the government, such as control over the border 
crossings and security forces, while leaving no money in the 
treasury to pay Palestinian salaries. 
 
¶3.    (SBU) In separate, harsher comments before Muslim 
worshipers in the Gaza Strip on April 14, Hamas Palestinian 
Legislative Council (PLC) member Yunis al-Astal warned that 
Palestinians might opt for Iraqi al-Qa'ida leader 
"Zarqawi-style" operations if the Hamas government is forced 
to collapse.  He said that the international community would 
then be forced to deal with a more extreme entity.  He also 
warned against the creation of a parallel "shadow government" 
that operated alongside the democratically elected Hamas-led 
government. 
 
Haniyyah Accuses Fatah of 
Colluding With Internationals 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4.    (SBU) PM Haniyyah continued his war of words during an 
April 16 meeting with Palestinian factional representatives, 
including the PFLP, DFLP, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), 
the Arab Liberation Front, and the Palestine Liberation 
Front.  (Note: Fatah did not participate in the April 16 
meeting.  End note.)  Haniyyah told those in attendance that 
the U.S., EU, and Israel are conspiring against the PA 
government.  He also suggested that some elements within 
Fatah are actively colluding with these efforts to undermine 
the government, and implied that chaos would erupt if this 
isolation continued.  Hamas would not sit idly by to these 
"unjust policies," Haniyyah reportedly said.  In comments 
similar to those made by PLC member al-Astal on April 14, 
Haniyyah warned that alternatives to the current PA 
government would be far more dangerous.  Haniyyah encouraged 
the factions to consider joining the government, adding that 
there is still time to form a broad coalition.
