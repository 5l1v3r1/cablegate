Â¶1. (SBU) ESTOFF and POLOFF made reftel points on May 18 to 
MFA Disarmament Affairs Deputy Director General Ignacio 
Sanchez and MFA Counselor for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and 
Disarmament Carlos Torres, urging Spain to submit to the 
Immediate Central Contact their HCOC Annual Declaration (AD) 
on space and ballistic missile policies.  Sanchez replied, a 
bit sheepishly, that Spain should have submitted its AD by 
March 30, but that a hold-up in Spain's interagency 
coordination process caused a delay.  Sanchez said the 
document is currently on his boss' desk and will be signed 
"next week."  Sanchez also told us that he would be attending 
the HCOC's sixth annual meeting in Vienna at the end of the 
month.
