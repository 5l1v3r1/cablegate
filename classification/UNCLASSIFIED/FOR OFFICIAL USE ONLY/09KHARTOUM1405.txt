¶1. (SBU) Summary: While the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) activities 
have diminished in Western Equatoria since September, there are 
reports that the LRA has moved operations into Raja County, Western 
Bahr el-Ghazal, and unconfirmed reports of movement into South 
Darfur.  The Ugandan People's Defense Force (UPDF) along with the 
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) continue to work together to 
target the LRA, but remain hampered by a lack of logistical 
resources and limited access to reliable intelligence.  The numbers 
of refugees and internally-displaced persons (IDPs) remain very 
high, with the majority of those affected being non-verified IDPs. 
Other issues of concern remain the nomadic Amboro tribe and food 
security in Western Equatoria, and the use of the "arrow boys" - a 
state-sanctioned community security response to the LRA.  End 
Summary.

LRA Attacks 
----------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) During the month of November, LRA attacks in Southern Sudan 
continued, albeit at a much lower rate than reported in the months 
of August and September of 2009.  While the LRA continued to operate 
in Western Equatoria and over the border in Central African Republic 
(CAR), new reports of LRA activity in Raja County of Western Bahr 
el-Ghazal and rumors of activity in South Darfur began to surface in 
October.  The UN, SPLA and UPDF have confirmed that the LRA attacked 
Boramedina in Raja on October 21.  The attack was on a much larger 
scale than normal for the LRA, with almost LRA attacking the town 
and possibly another 20 LRA securing its perimeter.  The group 
abducted 49 people to act as porters and killed three.  There were 
additional smaller attacks in Western Equatoria in November. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The SPLA reported that during the first week of November 
there were seven incidents, which resulted in one civilian death, 
the abduction of one civilian, the surrender of three LRA and the 
escape or rescue of eleven abductees.  During a November 24-26 visit 
to Yambio, the UNMIS Resident Coordinator for Yambio, Adewuyi 
Adewumi, confirmed reports that the LRA had attacked the area of 
Sakure on November 12 and 13.  A group of seven LRA entered the town 
of Sakure and told members of the community that they wished to 
surrender to the UPDF, but asked to meet with the tribal elders 
first.  Once the elders arrived, the group attacked, killing four 
civilians and abducting ten.  The UPDF pursued the group, and while 
in pursuit, found another three bodies outside of the village which 
they believe were killed by the same LRA group. 
 
¶4. (SBU) SPLA and UPDF reporting indicates that LRA activity is 
ongoing in Western Equatoria, particularly in the areas of Ezo and 
Tambura counties as well as over the border in CAR and DRC.  Since 
late September the SPLA and UPDF are reporting the movement of the 
LRA further north into Western Bahr el-Ghazal and as far south as 
the town of Daffak in Southern Darfur.  (Note: Although the 
Government of Sudan's (GOS) Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) acknowledged 
clashing with rebels in the area in early October, the GOS dit nou
