¶1.  (SBU)  Per reftel, post delivered message to Terence 
Craig, head of the Americas Division of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the government of Suriname (GOS).  Craig 
told EmbOff "you guys have our support... as long as it 
involves international peace and security, we are with you." 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Despite his fine sounding sentiments, Craig's 
comments were a diplomatic pleasantry--Suriname is unlikely 
to "support" the U.S. in any substantive way on this issue. 
Furthermore, Craig's reference to "as long as it involves 
international peace and security" was not a statement of 
solidarity, but a reminder that Suriname has concerns about 
the United States' ultimate goals and methods in Iran. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Post will report any substantive response from the 
GOS.
