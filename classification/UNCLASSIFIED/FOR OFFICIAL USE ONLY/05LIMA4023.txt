(SBU) D/Polcouns presented the demarche urging support for 
SUA non-proliferation amendments (Ref A) to Foreign Ministry 
Multilateral Political Affairs Director Julio Garro on 9/16. 
Garro referred to past GOP expressions of support for the 
Proliferation Security Initiative (Ref B), but noted that the 
current state of play with the SUA Convention Amendments was 
very complex, and that intra- and inter-ministerial 
coordination was still taking place.  Embassy will continue 
to press the GOP to come out in support of the U.S. positions 
on the SUA Amemdments at the October Diplomatic Conference, 
and we will report further is there is any additional 
clarification of Peru's position.
