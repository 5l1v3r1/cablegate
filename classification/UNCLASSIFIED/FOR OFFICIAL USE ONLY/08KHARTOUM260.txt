¶1. (SBU) With negotiations deadlocked over issues of power sharing 
and integration of former LRA combatants into the Ugandan army, a 
walkout-out by the LRA delegations on February 21 seemed to signal a 
possible end to the Juba Peace Talks that had resumed on January 30. 
 However, shuttle diplomacy apparently continued into the night and 
in the afternoon of February 22, post received reports that both 
sides have agreed to compromise language on the affected issues, 
which allows the parties to proceed with negotiations. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Now that a compromise has just been reached on 
what is termed Protocol Two, hopes are high again that a full 
agreement can be concluded by the end of next week.  The SPLM are 
doing their best to pressure each side to make accommodations for 
the sake of peace.  For the Juba Peace Talks to continue to succeed, 
sustained engagement and pressure by the international community 
continues to be essential.
