¶1. (SBU) Summary: The arrest of Vitalis Chadenga, the 
National Parks and Wildlife Authority's Operations 
Director, yet again reveals GOZ officials' predilection 
for private gain over public welfare and provides an 
insight into the fate of wildlife land if nationalized. 
End Summary 
 
¶2. (U) According to the August 4, 2004 edition of the GOZ- 
controlled Herald newspaper, Vitalis Chadenga was 
arrested on Monday, August 2, for "allegedly capturing 
wild animals worth about[Z]$198 million [approximately 
US$36543.43] without a permit and defrauding his employer 
of about [Z]$3,5 million [approximately US$645.96]." In 
addition to faking overseas official travel, Chadenga is 
also implicated in "captur[ing] 15 sable and 30 kudus in 
Mashonaland West for his personal use." He probably 
exported the animals or sold them as trophies. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to World Wildlife Fund's Raoul DuToit, 
the head of the Nyamaneche Game Capture Unit in Mvurwi 
assisted with the animal captures. Chadenga has also 
connived with South African safari operators in the 
Marongora and Matetsi areas. 
 
¶4. (SBU) National Parks' General Secretary Dr. Morris 
Mtsambiwa told EconOff the "investigations are underway 
on allegations of capture and translocation of game 
without a permit involving Mr. Chadenga and Game 
Management Africa. While the police are carrying out 
their investigations we are also carrying our own 
investigations and have since suspended one of our 
officers on the ground who actually took part in the 
capture of three sables in one of our parks. We still 
have to establish Mr. Chadenga's involvement." 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Once again, we see GOZ officials making 
private again out of public positions. This does not bode 
well for conservancies and other wildlife areas. 
Mtsambiwa assured EconOff that the selection process for 
proposed 25-year leases would ensure that only committed 
conservationists would receive wildlife area lands. Given 
the GOZ's management of the fast track land reform 
process, including numerous and credible allegations of 
high-placed party officials receiving prime land and 
failing to utilize it, we are skeptical about such 
assurances. Additionally, with National Parks officials 
illegally taking animals off GOZ-protected lands, one 
worries whether nationalized conservancies will face a 
similar fate.
