¶1. This message is Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please handle

¶2. (U) A South Jakarta court found former Corruption Eradication 
Commission (KPK) Chief Antasari Azhar guilty of planning the murder 
of businessman Nasrudin Zulkarnaen on February 11, sentencing him to 
18 years in prison.  Antasari will appeal the verdict.  The court 
also found former South Jakarta Police Chief Wiliardi Wizard and 7 
other accomplices guilty in the much-publicized case. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The KPK's credibility remains solid in spite of this 
verdict.  In a clear move to distance itself from Antasari, no one 
from the KPK appeared at the sentencing, which was open to the 
public.  Antasari burned his bridges with the KPK after apparently 
cooperating with police and prosecutors in efforts to frame the KPK 
deputies Chandra M. Hamzah and Bibit Samad Riyanto.  While Antasari 
claimed he was set up by police in an effort to weaken the KPK, the 
evidence presented in the case does not support this version of 
events.  Unlike the Bibit-Chandra case, Antasari's conviction has 
not generated a significant public outcry. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Meanwhile, the KPK continues to actively pursue prominent 
corruption suspects.  Also on February 11, the KPK arrested former 
member of Parliament Dudhie Makmum from opposition party PDIP, a 
close associate of senior PDIP.  The KPK arrested Dudhie for 
allegedly receiving a bribe in the nomination process for Bank of 
Indonesia's Board of Governors.  It is unclear at this time at this 
time if the KPK will arrest additional suspects in this case.
