SUBJECT:  UNESCO CULTURAL DIVERSITY CONVENTION NOT ON 
TURKEY'S LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
 
Ref: STATE 19851 
 
¶1. (SBU) The UNESCO Convention on the Protection and 
Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is 
not currently on the Turkish legislative agenda.  Our 
contacts at the Turkish Parliamentary Offices to whom we 
mentioned it had not heard of the Convention and did not 
anticipate its being placed on the legislative agenda in 
the near future. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  Because of Turkey's current EU 
accession discussions, post does not believe that a 
public diplomacy campaign opposing the Convention would 
be beneficial.  It could in fact raise the public's 
awareness of the subject and bring it to the attention 
of Turkish Parliamentarians and government officials. 
End comment.
