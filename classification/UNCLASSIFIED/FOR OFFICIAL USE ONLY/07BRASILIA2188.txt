¶1.   On November 19, 2007 Econoff met with an advisor to the Council 
for Financial Activities Control (COAF) in Brasilia.   COAF has 
actively worked with Customs to discourage illegal transportation of 
funds domestically and internationally.  Brazilian regulations allow 
up to Reais $10,000 (approximately USD $5,000) to be carried 
undeclared on international flights; above that amount, Custom 
officials should be notified with an explanation provided by the 
passenger.  COAF has partnered with Customs in creating a data base 
called the Electronic Declaration of Cash Carriage (EDPV), which will 
assist in monitoring individuals who transfer funds abroad.  Although 
the system is a prototype and is still being tested, Brazilian law 
enforcement officials are encouraged by initial results. 
 
¶2.   In Brazil, the laws that govern individuals with financial 
transit crimes remain tenuous at best and tend to be on case-by-case 
bases.  The funds are generally seized and held for 48 hours in order 
to provide time for an investigation.  The COAF adviser admits that 
there is still much work to be done in Brazil to counter illicit cash 
couriers, however, currently there is a bill  before the Minister of 
Justice  for approval  which will increase training and the budget to 
counter such illicit cash/drug smuggling regimes in Brazil.  The GOB 
understands the connection between the cash couriers and terrorism, 
and has therefore undertaken the necessary steps to receive guidance 
from the Financial Action of South American (GAFICUD) and the 
Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
