SUBJECT: United Arab Emirates Investments Target Tunisia 
 
REF: (a) TUNIS 2488; (b) TUNIS 0629; (c) TUNIS 2598; 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: In a period of less than 12 months, the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE) has become the biggest single foreign investor in 
Tunisia, surpassing France, which, excluding energy, has been the 
largest investor in Tunisia over the last five years.  Comment: 
While UAE investors have been active in Tunisia for a number of 
years, the oil boom has meant that they have billions to spend -- 
and they have decided to spend a good deal of it in Tunisia.  End 
comment.  The recent sale of 35 percent of Tunisie Telecom, 
Tunisia's national telecommunications agency, to a Dubai Holding 
consortium for USD 2.25 billion, set off a frenzy of planned 
investment amounting to over USD 20 billion.  The bulk of the 
investment targets prime real estate in the city of Tunis and its 
immediate suburbs.  Sale of this state-owned property was not opened 
to public tender and a U.S. company has claimed it was barred from 
making an offer for one of the development sites, ultimately sold to 
a Dubai Holding company for a reported USD 15 billion.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
¶2. BACKGROUND: Dubai Holding is controlled by Sheikh Mohammed Bin 
Rashid Al Maktoum, the current vice president of the UAE and Prime 
Minister and ruler of Dubai.  In May 2006 his wife, Princess Haya 
Bint Al Hussein, paid a visit to Tunisia and was widely covered in 
the media in the company of President Ben Ali's wife.  The CEO of 
Dubai Holding, Mr. Mohammed Al Gergawi, also visited Tunisia earlier 
this year and announced that a fund of USD 300 million would be 
available for investment in the share capital of Tunisian companies 
or on the Tunisian Stock Exchange.  Gergawi is also chairman of 
another member of the group, Dubai International Capital.  Several 
other Emirati groups have also launched projects in Tunisia. 
Meanwhile, Emirates Airlines has just started a five times weekly 
service between Dubai and Tunis (Ref A).  END BACKGROUND. 
 
¶3.  Known and planned investments in Tunisia by various Emirati 
groups include:

overpasses, a football stadium, and the renovation of the old port 
of Tunis into a marina.  The local headquarters of Dubai Holding has 
been built adjacent to the old port and was expected to be 
inaugurated on November 7, not coincidentally the anniversary of 
President Ben Ali's accession to power (in 1987).  Construction of 
the building took only 52 days.  There had been US interest in the 
Lac Sud project but a US company was not allowed to present its

commercial bank when new Tunisian legislation amended the statutes 
of financial institutions in 2001.  BTE can now offer the whole 
range of financial services.  The capital is approximately USD 70 
million.  The chairman of the bank is an Emirati and the CEO is

--DAMAC HOLDING 
 
On November 3 the Tunisian press reported a meeting between 
President Ben Ali and the CEO of Dubai's DAMAC Holding group, 
stating that "certain projects that the group proposes to carry out 
were presented during the meeting."  No other details were given. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT: Most press commentaries on the upsurge in Emirati 
investments are keen to point out that at last Tunisia is being 
recognized as a favorable site for Arab investment.  There has been 
no public negative comment on the implications of this influx, but 
privately citizens are saying Tunisia is being been sold to the 
Emirates.  The October 19 edition of the weekly magazine Realites 
published a large dossier presenting the Emirati projects and 
questioned "Why, after having almost ignored Tunisia for the past 
twenty to thirty years, and despite the existence of the 
Tuniso-Emirate bank since the 1980s, are private Emirati investors 
now in such a rush to invest in our country?"  Realites concluded 
that this is because, "They have been assured by the Tunisian 
authorities they will have all the necessary facilities to carry out 
their projects under the best conditions, and in all transparency." 
However, the way state-owned land is being distributed, and to whom, 
suggests that the buyers will be offered all the necessary 
assistance.  As for transparency, well, it seems to be close to 
irrelevant when talking about Emirati investments in Tunisia.  END 
COMMENT.
