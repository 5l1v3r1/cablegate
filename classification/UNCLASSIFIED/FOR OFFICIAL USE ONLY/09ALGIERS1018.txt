¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Unconfirmed reports that Algerian fans 
were injured and killed in attacks in Cairo November 14 
following a soccer match between the two countries' national 
teams have led to public gatherings and some violence. 
Embassy has no GOA confirmation of deaths among Algerian fans 
in Cairo.  A crowd of several hundred marched past an Embassy 
residence on their way to the Egyptian Embassy November 15 
but never threatened USG facilities.  Most of the crowds were 
peaceful, but small groups have attacked Egyptian businesses 
in the capital.  Embassy is under no threat.  A November 10 
Embassy EAC decision to warn Embassy personnel to exercise 
proactive caution and a November 14 warden message warning 
Amcits to take heightened security precautions remain in 
effect.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Algiers is abuzz with reports of injuries to and 
deaths of Algerian fans in Cairo following the November 14 
Algeria-Egypt World Cup qualifying match.  The claimed death 
toll given in November 16 press reports ranges from one to 
twelve; reported numbers of injured vary from twenty to over 
one hundred.  One press report says the consular section of 
the Algerian Embassy in Cairo confirmed one death; others say 
the Algerian Ambassador in Cairo has denied any Algerian 
fatalities.  Embassy has no GOA confirmation of any deaths. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The match, which Egypt won 2-0 but which will be 
followed by a runoff match in Sudan November 18, has 
generated a stream of emotional reporting in the Algerian 
press.  Press commentary is indignant about the treatment of 
Algerians, the alleged complicity of Egyptian authorities, 
and the lack of an adequate reaction by Algerian authorities. 
 There are reports that Air Algerie is issuing cut-price 
tickets for Algerians to fly to Khartoum to attend the 
November 18 game. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A group of protestors estimated at 6-700 persons was 
spotted at approximately 2130 November 15 in the area of Val 
d' Hydra, approximately 1.5 miles from the Egyptian embassy. 
 The crowd was dispersed by local police forces, and then 
split into two separate groups, one of which marched past a 
24-unit Embassy residence on their way to the Egyptian 
Embassy.  A third group of protestors of undertermined size 
was already posted at the Egyptian Embassy.  Protestors at no 
time targeted the American residence or the nearby U.S. 
Embassy.  RSO police sources report street disturbances and 
small fires during the day November 16 in the downtown 
Didouche Mourad shopping area.  They also report that 
Egyptians in Algiers have been advised to stay home.  Press 
reports on November 16 note that several retail offices of 
Algeria's largest private wireless communications provider, 
Egyptian-owned Djezzy, were ransacked.  Embassy knows of one 
other small Egyptian business that was attacked.  There are 
reports that one Egyptian national was injured in an attack 
and hospitalized. 
 
¶5. (SBU) RSO kept Embassy community informed via text message 
of the course of events throughout the evening of November 
15-16.  Following EAC held November 10 (reftel), RSO warned 
Embassy personnel to exercise proactive personal security 
after the November 14 game.  Following reports that an 
Algerian team bus was attacked in Cairo November 13, injuring 
three players, Embassy issued a warden message November 14 
warning American citizens to avoid the area around the 
Egyptian Embassy, where crowds had gathered, and generally to 
stay away from large public gatherings.  That warden message 
remains in effect. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Embassy will continue to monitor the situation and 
assess post security posture in the leadup to, and following, 
the November 18 rematch in Sudan.
