SUBJECT:  FIRST IRAQI REFUGEE TRAVELS FROM SYRIA FOR RESETTLEMENT IN 
THE US 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) The first Iraqi refugee to get resettlement in the U.S. 
from this year's processing in Syria traveled on August 21.  An 
adult male, he will be settled in San Jose, California.  A total of 
146 Iraqi individuals from Iraq will move to the U.S. in August, and 
200 more are expected to travel before the end of the fiscal year. 
This represents the first substantial movement of Iraqis since the 
fall of Saddam Hussein. 
¶2. (SBU) Over time, these refugees will have implications for our 
consular caseload, as we receive Visas 92 and 93 follow-to-join 
cases.
