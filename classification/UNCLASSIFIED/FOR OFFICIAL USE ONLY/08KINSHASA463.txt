SUBJECT: KISANGANI MEETING: POSITIVE MOVEMENT ON THE PART OF FDLR 
ELEMENTS? 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Poloff attended the May 26 Kisangani meeting at 
which the GDRC and elements from FDLR-RUD and the RPR (Rassemblement 
du Peuple Rwandais) made public a document related to these armed 
groups' disarmament and repatriation or resettlement.  The 
conference was principally ceremonial and was well attended by GDRC 
notables and members of the international community.  The identities 
and affiliations of all those representing the armed groups, who 
appeared to number 25-30, were less clear.  MONUC and GDRC 
representatives told us in advance that it would be primarily 
members of the RUD who would come to the conference, though a few 
FOCA members were reportedly present as well.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Poloff attended the May 26 Kisangani meeting at which the 
GDRC and elements from FDLR-RUD and the RPR made public a document 
(copy to be e-mailed to AF/C) related to these armed groups' 
disarmament and repatriation or resettlement, previously worked out 
in meetings in Italy.  The meeting was ceremonial, lasted 
approximately two hours, and featured principally speeches from 
representatives from the GDRC, the international community, and the 
armed groups hailing the agreement. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The document, entitled "Roadmap for the disarmament of 
Rwandan armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo," outlines 
a number of notable milestones, including: 
 
-- A condemnation of the genocide in Rwanda and a demand 
   that its perpetrators be brought to justice. 
 
-- Expressions of regret for the massive human rights 
   violations inflicted on the Congolese people and a 
   demand that perpetrators of these acts be brought to 
   justice. 
 
-- Confirmation of willingness to disarm and return to 
   Rwanda or relocate within the DRC. 
 
-- Return to Rwanda, however, is preconditioned on the 
   basis of security guarantees to be worked out with 
   Rwanda under the aegis of the international community. 
   The document also notes that, for the moment, 
   conditions for return to Rwanda are not yet right. 
 
-- A request for security to be provided by MONUC and the 
   FARDC for those engaged in the process of disarmament; 
   a request was also made for food, education for 
   children, and appropriate sanitation to be provided. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The roadmap notes that verification of relocation/welcome 
sites will take place within 5 days and the process of disarmament 
will begin in 10 days.  The GDRC for its part rendered a statement 
reaffirming the will of the government to mobilize the means to 
conduct this program, and encouraged those partners involved with 
the Nairobi communique to increase the incentives for members of 
Rwandan armed groups to disarm and repatriate. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The meeting was well attended by GDRC and international 
figures.  Interior Minister Kalume represented President Kabila at 
the meeting; other GDRC notables in attendance included Defense 
Minister Chikez and Presidential Special Envoy Seraphin Ngwej.  SRSG 
Doss was present; EU Special Representative Roeland van de Geer sent 
his political counselor Jean-Michel Dumont.  Representatives from 
the embassies of France, Belgium, South Africa, Sweden, Italy, 
Russia, and China, and from the community of Sant'Egidio were in 
attendance as well. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Less clear were the identities of the members of the FDLR 
in attendance, who appeared to number approximately 25-30.  A few of 
their wives and children also came to the conference.  The FDLR-RUD 
leaders Felicien Kanyamibwa and Jean-Marie Vianney Higiro were not 
obviously present (Note: Kanyamibwa signed the roadmap at the Rome 
meeting May 9 in the name of the "National Congress for Democracy" 
which appears to be a melding of the FDLR-RUD, the RPR, and perhaps 
other elements as well. End note) MONUC and GDRC representatives 
told us in advance that it would be primarily members of the RUD who 
would come to the conference, though a few FOCA members were 
reportedly present as well. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Two representatives from the armed groups spoke at the 
conference, one in the name of the aforementioned National Congress 
for Democracy and the other seemingly in the name of the RUD 
military wing and the RPR.  The former was Augustin Dukuze, who 
lives in Canada and who has previously been identified as a RUD 
spokesperson; the latter was introduced simply as "Jean-Michel."

¶8.  (SBU) The speeches delivered consisted principally of laudatory 
words that the armed groups were willing to take this step towards 
disarmament and repatriation.  Ambassador Ngwej noted pointedly that 
the DRC will facilitate this agreement without any concern to an 
inter-Rwandan dialogue, which he labeled an "absurd" conditionality. 
 This did not stop "Jean-Michel" from making reference to the need 
for political change in Rwanda, though there was no apparent 
conditionality to his statement.  He asked all fighters to join in 
this process.  SRSG Doss noted that MONUC stands ready to support. 
Dumont spoke on behalf of Special Representative van de Geer and 
welcomed the armed groups' willingness to disarm.  Minister Kalume 
called on the "extremists" to seize this one last chance for peace. 
The USG statement was read by a Congolese protocol representative. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Comment: The timetable's projected dates for disarmament 
and transfer to relocation sites seem ambitious; MONUC 
representatives should be involved in working out these modalities 
and we will follow up on the status of the implementation.  In 
previous meetings, GDRC representatives told us that this process 
should affect approximately 500 fighters plus dependents, for a 
total of around 3,000 FDLR members.  While this will not solve the 
entire FDLR problem, as certain elements have publicly rejected this 
process, it could be a start and demonstrate the progress that 
political dialogue can affect.  Embassy Kinshasa will also follow up 
to attempt to confirm the names of those representing the armed 
groups at the conference.  On a final note, one of Ambassador 
Ngwej's staff came up to poloff after the U.S. statement was read 
and noted its "strong" tone.  We hope the statement created a 
similar reaction among FDLR attendees at the Conference.  End 
comment.
