This cable provides talking points Posts may use to

media. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) BEGIN TALKING POINTS: 
 
- Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Bill 
Burns will join EU Foreign Policy Chief Javier Solana 
and 
P5+1 Political Directors in a meeting with Iranian 
Nuclear 
Negotiator Saeed Jalili in Geneva on July 19. 
Ambassador 
Burns will be in Geneva to receive Iran's response to 
the 
P5+1 offer delivered in Tehran last month. 
 
- This will be a one-time U.S. participation to 
demonstrate P5+1 unity behind our offer to Iran and to 
reinforce the Secretary's signature on the P5+1 letter 
to 
the Iranians.  We will be there to listen, not 
negotiate. 
He will not meet separately with Mr. Jalili. 
 
- While in Geneva, Ambassador Burns will also reiterate 
that our terms for negotiation remain the same - Iran 
must fully and verifiably suspend its enrichment- 
related 
and reprocessing activities.  Secretary Rice will meet 
with the Iranians anytime, any place to discuss any 
topic 
should they take this single step. 
 
- Iran should recognize the opportunity now before it 
and 
take advantage of the readiness of the international 
community, as reflected in the updated package of 
incentives recently provided by the P5+1, to help Iran 
in 
all areas outlined in the offer. 
 
- The means by which Iran would be able to secure the 
active support of the international community is the 
offer 
from the P5+1 that is now on the table.  The United 
States 
is fully associated with that offer, as evidenced by 
the 
signature of Secretary of State Rice on the 
accompanying 
letter. 
 
- The United States hopes Iran will recognize the 
benefits 
contained in the offer and enter into serious 
negotiations 
on its terms. 
 
- The United States also hopes Iran recognizes the 
risks 
and costs inherent in ignoring the offer or in failing 
to 
treat it seriously. 
 
- The increasing economic and political isolation Iran 
is 
now experiencing--the result of steadily eroding 
international confidence in its true intentions with 
respect to its nuclear program--will only increase. 
 
- The United States hopes Iran understands the choices 
before it.  The only damage to Iran has come from the 
decisions Iran's leaders themselves have made. 
 
IF ASKED: What is "freeze for freeze" and how would it 
be 
 
STATE 00076649  002 OF 002 
 
 
- Freeze for freeze is a creative idea that the P5+1 
developed to attract Iran to the negotiating table.  If 
Iran agrees to stop all new nuclear activity, the P5+1 
will also halt consideration of new UNSC measures 
during a 
time-limited period of six weeks in order to get Iran 
to 
the negotiating table.  This is a short-term, interim 
step 
intended to get Iran to a suspension. 
 
END TALKING POINTS.
