REF: KINSHASA 698 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Legal experts from DRC, Uganda, and Burundi met in 
Goma, North Kivu July 23-26 to examine possible judicial 
mechanisms and procedures to use against negative forces in 
the territories of the Tripartite Plus countries, as decided 
at the June session of the Tripartite Plus Joint Commission 
(reftel).  The Rwandan delegation did not participate, 
claiming they had not received an official invitation in time. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The experts' final report highlights agreement on 
the following actions: 
 
-- to criminalize, and subject to extradition perpetrators 
of, acts of aggression and subversion defined in the first 
article of the Protocol for Non-Agression and Mutual Defense 
in the draft Convention on Legal Cooperation; 
 
-- to harmonize existing extradition agreements through 
adopting a draft Convention on Legal Cooperation between 
Tripartite Plus member states; 
 
-- to recommend that Tripartite Plus member states prosecute 
or remove from office members of negative forces whose names 
are on the most wanted list and who reside in members' 
respective territories; 
 
-- to recommend that Tripartite Plus member states 
investigate, identify, and establish a list of other persons 
threatening peace and security in their territory, and to 
arrest them for prosecution; 
 
-- to recommend that Tripartite Plus member states integrate 
into their national legislation the Pacts, Accords, and 
Protocols agreed through the International Conference on 
Peace, Security, and Democracy in the Great Lakes Region 
(IC/GLR), and to ratify the draft Convention on Legal 
Cooperation agreed by the legal experts; 
 
-- to refer the point on methods of freezing assets of most 
wanted person as well as the application of measures to 
restrict their travel and movement to another meeting after 
the next Tripartite Plus ministerial. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Marie France Mubenga, the chief Congolese legal 
expert, told us July 26 that the conference went well and 
much had been accomplished.  She regretted the decision of 
the Rwandans not to attend.  She said the draft Convention on 
Legal Cooperation would be considered at the next Tripartite 
Plus ministerial in Kampala in September. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The text of the draft Convention on Legal 
Cooperation has been transmitted to AF/C.
