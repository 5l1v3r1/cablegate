¶1. (SBU) Summary:  As of January 29 the total number of UNAMID 
military personnel was 12,540, or just over 64 percent of the total 
authorized force strength. UNAMID senior staff agree that the 
deployment goal is impossible to secure by Mabch 31.  In fact, 
UNAMID's shipping pipeline may be empty within 90 days if DPKO does 
not demand load lists for upcoming deployments from TCCs.  Movement 
of Contingent Owned Equipment (COE) has not yet been affected by 
recent hostilities near Muhajariya and El Fasher between JEM rebels 
and the GOS.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Between January 25 and 29 Poloff spoke with the following 
UNAMID officials: Col. Noddy Stafford, Chief of Military Plans; Lt. 
Col. Andrew Moeti, Staff Officer for Operational Plans; Tony Harvey, 
Staff Officer for Operational Plans; Col. Hussein Al Hasan, Formed 
Police Unit (FPU) Coordination Officer; Tony Mundell, JLOC 
Supervisor; and Mostasem Atoum, FPU Coordinator. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Stafford reported that as of January 29 the total number of 
UNAMID military personnel was 12,540, or just over 64 percent of the 
total authorized force strength.  UNAMID senior staff agree that 
reaching the 90 percent deployment by March 31 will be impossible, 
and there is strong resistance in the mission to bring in troops 
without their equipment.  Moeti is concerned that UNAMID's shipping 
pipeline will run dry within 90 days and Stafford voiced concern 
that load lists promised by TCCs due to deploy in early 2009 
continue to be delayed.  Lists for Ethiopian Battalion 2, Senegalese 
Battalion 2, Burkina Faso 1, Thailand Battalion 1, and Tanzania 
Battalion 1 have not been submitted to the UN by those countries. 
Stafford urged that DPKO be pressured to demand the load lists. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Airfield operations in El Geneina continue to be 
problematic.  While the condition of the new runway is good 
according to UNAMID, the new runway isn't yet on the list approved 
by the Sudanese Civil Aviation Association (SCAA) so it cannot be 
used by UNAMID.  UNAMID is discussing the approvah with the SCAA and 
hopes to have the matter resolved within a week.  UNAMID will then 
be able to move equipment via IL 76, as the new runway is much 
longer than the runway at the old airport. 
 
Ethiopian Attack Helicopter Company 
----------------------------------- 
¶5. (SBU) UNAMID is currently AttemPting to d`termine The best 
location at which to base the incoming Ethiopian Attack Helicopter 
Company.  Stafford and his staff agree that the optimum permanent 
base would be in Nyala with two Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) in 
Zalingei and El Fasher for flexibility of movement.  Aviation 
experts must still visit the proposed sites before a decision is 
made.  The units are not expected to arrive before May. 
 
COE Movement 
------------ 
¶6. (SBU) Recent hostilities between JEM and SAF near Muhajeriya in 
South Darfur and outside of El Fasher in North Darfur halted UNAMID 
air and ground operations near the affected cities for 48 hours, but 
did not yet significantly hinder movement of COE.  More than 90 
percent of all equipMent has been received by the following military 
units: 
 
Chinese Engineers--Nyala 
Egyptian Engineers--El Fasher 
Egypian B!ttalion--Um Kadada 
Egyptian Transport Company--Nyala 
Bangladesh Multi-Role Logistics Unit--Nyala 
 
¶7. (SBU) Equipment is moving smoothly for the rest of the 
battalions; most equipment has been moved or is currently loaded on 
trucks or trains awaiting GoS escort.  Only the Nigerian Level II 
hospital currently is experiencing a delay. Howeve2, this movement 
should be complete within a week.  Priority of movement continues to 
beQ 1) Nigerian Level II hospital; 2) Ethiopian Infantry APCs; 3) 
Ethiopian COE; 4) Nigerian FPU COE; 5) Ethiopian COE. 
 
FPU Update 
---------- 
¶8. (SBU) Five Formed Police Units (FPUs) are currently in Darfur 
with a total of 700 police officers.  Phe Indonesian FPU is located 
in Sector North, the Bangladeshi and Nepalese FPUs are in Sector 
South, and the two Nigerian FPUs are located in Sector West.  The 
two new Nigerian FPUs are currently in El Geneina, but the Nigerian 
FPU 2 completed its advance party ppeparations and is ready to send 
theremaining 100 officers to Zalingei.  The Nigerian FPU 3 will 
 
KHARTOUM 00000142  002 OF 002 
 
 
arrive in July and will deploy to Nertiti, Sector West.  T(e COE for 
these FPUs is reportedly moving well. 
 
Incoming FPU Schedule 
--------------------- 
February 
The Egyptian FPUs 1 and 2 are scheduled to arrive hn mid-February in 
Graida, Sector Souph, but reportedly have been delayed by the 
Egyptian government pending the outcome of the ICC decision on a 
Bashir arrest warrant (acaording to UNAMID).  The Egyptians are 
reportedly concerned the FPUs might have to re-deployed or removed 
quickly if the GoS takes action against UNAMID.  The Jordanian FPU 1 
sent its reconnaissance team to its deployment location in the El 
Fasher super camp on January 30.  Al Hassein and Atoum are confident 
that the team will authorize the Jordanians to deploy within the 
next two to three weeks and may even move up the deployment date. 
 
March 
The Bangladesh FPU 2 will deploy to the Nyala super camp in early 
March.  The COE has been in transit since the beginning of January 
and should arrive in late February.  The Bangladesh FPU 3 is also 
scheduled to deploy in March going to Shangil Tobay, but the arrival 
date is expected to be delayed until May to allow time to expand the 
camp. 
 
May 
Bangladesh FPU 4 is expected to arrive in early May which may be 
before the upgrades on camp facilities can be completed in El 
Geneina.  A logistical assessment is currently ongoing to determine 
options for temporary housing to allow the unit to arrive on time 
and start operations while camp construction is finalized. 
 
July 
The Nigerian FPU 3 is scheduled to arrive in July and set up camp in 
Nertiti, Sector West.  The camp is currently operational and housing 
a Rwandan battalion. 
 
Recent Violence 
--------------- 
¶9. (SBU) Al Hussein stated that after the recent fighting and 
bombing near El Fasher, the FPUs are concentrating on providing 
24-hour patrols and community policing to improve confidence inQ 
UNAMID and maintain calm within the camps.  Al Hassan hopes To 
assure both IDPs and the international community that the FPUs 
intend to continue to protect civilians and liaise with the SAF and 
rebels despite the violence.  He has personally met with IDP camp 
leaders to reassure them. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) Embofbs will follow up with UNAMID officials this week to 
determine what airport upgrades may be required to accommodate the 
long delayed (by the UN) Ethiopian helicopter units.
