SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-LICENSE/PRE-SHIPMENT 
END-USE CHECK ON LICENSE 050196988 
 
REF: IIR 6 809 0246 09 OF 28 AUGUST 2009 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Action Request. See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-license/pre-shipment check on license 050196988 for 
the export of firearms and ammunition to Brazil.  Post is 
requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. 
 Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending 
and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. (U//FOUO) Reason for Request:  PM/DTCC has not done many 
Blue Lantern checks on firearms exported to Brazil, largely 
due to the relatively small quantities of firearms that are 
exported on any given export license.  The current license 
for six (6) firearms and ammunition components is typical of 
most firearms export licenses to Brazil, in that the end-user 
is a specific individual and the quantity is relatively 
small.  Nonetheless, reporting indicates that U.S.-origin 
firearms continue to be used in crimes in Brazil (REFTEL). 
This check is to establish the bona fides of the end-user and 
determine if the firearms will be retransfer to another 
end-user. 
 
¶4. (U) Action Request: Post is requested to establish the 
bona fides of end-user Joao Antonio Franciosi by making 
inquiries to Mr. Franciosi and appropriate authorities of the 
Government of Brazil.  Post is requested to determine why the 
end-user is importing six firearms and whether he is in the 
business of selling firearms in Brazil.  The following points 
are included for guidance: 
 
(To Joao Antonio Franciosi) 
 
--Do you have any business interests in the firearms industry 
of Brazil?  Do you ever sell firearms in Brazil?  Do you sell 
firearms to customers that reside outside Brazil?  If so, 
have you ever sold firearms you received from U.S. vendors? 
 
--Please explain why you are importing six (6) firearms on 
this export license.  For what will each of these firearms be 
used? 
 
--How many firearms do you current maintain in your personal 
collection? 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
(To Appropriate Import/Export and/or Law Enforcement 
Authorities) 
 
--Is Joao Antonio Franciosi properly authorized to import and 
own firearms in Brazil?  Do you have any record of Mr. 
Franciosi selling firearms? 
 
--Do you have any information on Joao Antonio Franciosi that 
would question his reliability as a recipient of U.S. defense 
articles? 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
