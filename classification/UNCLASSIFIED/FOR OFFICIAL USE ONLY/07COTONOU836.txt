SUBJECT: BENIN: CUBA EMBARGO RESOLUTION AT THE UNGA 
 
REF: STATE 148506 
 
1.(SBU) On October 29, Poloff delivered reftel demarche to the 
Director of International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Mr. Thomas Adoumasse. Mr. Adoumasse acknowledged the 
seriousness of the human rights problem in Cuba, which he attributed 
to the Castro regime. He said that the Group of 77 and the Movement 
of Non-Aligned States put a great deal of pressure on UNGA's African 
delegates to vote for the resolution. 
 
2.(SBU) Due to pressure from those groups Adoumasse underscored the 
GOB could not use an Explanation of Vote in the Cuba Resolution. 
Adoumasse did raise the possibility the GOB would abstain from 
voting on the resolution. Adoumasse stated he would discuss this 
with Benin's Permanent Representative to the UN.
