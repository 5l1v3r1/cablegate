(SBU) We delivered refs A and B demarches to MFA Deputy 
Director for East and South Europe and the Balkans, Ahmed 
Hamdy Bakr, on March 5, urging Egypt to support welcoming 
Kosovo's independence at the upcoming OIC summit, reiterating 
requests for Egypt to recognize Kosovo's independence (ref 
C), and raising potential financial support from Egypt at the 
June Kosovo donors conference.  Bakr replied that the GOE is 
still in the evaluation stage on recognizing Kosovo, noting 
that so far most of Kosovo's neighbors have not yet 
recognized its independence.  Bakr said he would forward our 
request for Egypt to support a statement in the OIC 
communiqu welcoming Kosovo's independence to Foreign 
Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit.  Bakr had no substantive response 
on donor assistance at this time, as the GOE has not yet 
decided to recognize Kosovo's independence.
