Nope, Still Not Playing 
----------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On April 24, Rudra Nepal, Under Secretary for UN 
and International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, told Emboff that the Government of Nepal (GON) would 
be unlikely to send any delegates to the Inaugural Global 
Initiative Information Portal Advisory Committee meeting in 
Tallinn, Estonia, June 2-4 (Ref A).  The Under Secretary said 
he did not know when the GON would establish an 
inter-ministry committee to handle Global Initiative issues. 
 
Bahrain Welcomed 
---------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Rudra Nepal welcomed Bahrain as a partner nation in 
the Global Initiative (Ref B).  He expressed interest in the 
number of countries that have joined the Global Initiative in 
recent months.
