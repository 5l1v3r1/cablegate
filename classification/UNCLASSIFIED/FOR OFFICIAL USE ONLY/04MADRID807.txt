REF: STATE 44695 
 
(SBU)  We presented reftel points on March 3 to the Officer 
in Charge for International Disarmament Affairs, Marcos 
Rodriguez Cantero, at the MFA.  Rodriguez pointed out that 
Spain's balance budget policy limits its voluntary 
contributions to the Technical Cooperation Program to less 
than forty percent of its target rate of attainment.  For 
this reason, Spain may not be able to meet this year's target 
contribution percentage.  He assured us, however, that Spain 
will continue to meet its compulsory contributions to the 
IAEA's regular budget.
