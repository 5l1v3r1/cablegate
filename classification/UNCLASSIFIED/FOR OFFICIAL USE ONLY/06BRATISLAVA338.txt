¶1. (U) This is a guidance request, see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Vladimir Jakabcin, General Director of 
the Department of Defense Policy, International Relations and

dogs to meet the needs of NTM-1 per Reftel. Including time

for service in 6 to 12 months. The Slovaks are preparing 
these dog teams specifically in response to the US demarche 
delivered per Reftel.

teams even if they do not become available for service for up
