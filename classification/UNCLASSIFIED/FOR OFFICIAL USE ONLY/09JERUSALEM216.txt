SUBJECT: GAZA HUMANITARIAN REPORT JANUARY 30 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  OCHA reported on January 29 that an 
average of 80 truckloads per day entered Gaza via Kerem 
Shalom since the ceasefire.  The Gaza water utility cannot 
make needed repairs on the water and wastewater networks 
until the GOI allows the entry of essential spare parts.  End 
summary. 
 
Crossings 
--------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) January 30:  Crossings are open, and approximately 
80 truckloads are scheduled to move through Kerem Shalom. 
Nahal Oz fuel transfer station was closed, according to power 
plant contacts.  Karni conveyor belt was open for 
approximately 50 truckloads of wheat and grains, according to 
transportation contacts. 
 
¶3. (SBU) January 29:  Crossings were partially open. 
Contacts reported that 75 truckloads passed via Kerem Shalom. 
 A total of 45 truckloads of wheat and grains entered via 
Karni,s conveyer belt.  Nahal Oz fuel station was limited to 
the transfer of 240,000 liters of industrial fuel for the 
power plant and 59 tons of cooking gas. 
 
¶4. (SBU) EU contacts reported on January 29 that the GOI has 
rejected the plan to expand Kerem Shalom,s capacity to 250 
truckloads per day because of &security incidents.8  COGAT 
officials said the maximum number of truckloads will remain 
¶150. 
 
¶5. (SBU) ICRC reported on Jan 29 that only 13 of 36 trucks 
requested in the last week were approved.  Of those, only six 
were eventually allowed into Gaza. 
 
¶6. (SBU) OCHA reported on January 29 that an average of 80 
truckloads per day entered Gaza via Kerem Shalom since the 
ceasefire on January 18. 
 
Health 
------ 
 
¶7. (SBU) OCHA reported on January 29 that the decreasing 
number of patients in Gaza hospitals has allowed for the 
provision of routine care for chronic illnesses and elective 
surgery.  Hospitals are receiving electricity intermittently 
and still rely on generators for back-up electricity supply. 
Much of Gaza,s hospital equipment is dilapidated and in need 
of repair because of the closure of the Gaza Strip during the 
past year and a half. 
 
Water/Sewage 
------------ 
 
¶8. (SBU) The water and sanitation sector group reported on 
January 29 that there is a real need for the distribution of 
bottled water in Gaza.  Gaza City,s water supply is 
reportedly contaminated because damage to the sewage 
treatment plant allowed sewage to infiltrate the water 
supply. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Approximately 70 percent of Gaza,s water wells are 
functioning, but certain localities are not receiving water, 
including 10,000 people in Beit Hanoun.  The Gaza City 
wastewater treatment plant was partially repaired on January 
23, halting the leakage of wastewater into surrounding 
agricultural fields.  Following additional repairs, sewage no 
longer is leaking into the streets of Beit Hanoun and Beit 
Lahia. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Gaza,s water utility (CMWU) continues to work on 
urgent maintenance of the water and wastewater networks, 
though it will be unable to complete repairs without the 
entry of needed spare parts into Gaza.  CMWU currently has a 
list of prioritized items, such as pipes, generators, and 
pumps, awaiting clearance by the Israeli authorities for 
entry into Gaza, according to OCHA. 
 
 
Food 
---- 
 
¶11. (SBU) Shops and markets continue to offer limited food 
supplies, but prices are reportedly two or three times higher 
than before the conflict. 
 
¶12. (SBU) On 25 January, UNRWA conducted a first-time food 
 
JERUSALEM 00000216  002 OF 002 
 
 
distribution to nearly 50,000 Palestinian Authority employees 
who are registered refugees. 
 
Fuel/Electricity 
---------------- 
 
¶13. (SBU) Gaza now receives 202 MW (120 MW from Israel, 65 MW 
from the Gaza Power Plant, and 17 MW from Egypt).  The total 
current demand is 225-240 MW.  The Gaza Power Plant manager 
reported on January 30 that the plant has only one day of 
fuel remaining and will have to reduce output from 65 MW to 
30 MW until additional fuel arrives. 
 
¶14. (SBU) GEDCO has implemented a power cut schedule: Gaza 
and North Gaza will face eight-hour power cuts three times 
per week, and the Middle Area and Khan Yunis will face 6-8 
hour power cuts twice per week. 
 
¶15. (SBU) A total of 38 transformers essential for the repair 
of Gaza,s electricity system are awaiting GOI permission for 
entry into Gaza, according to OCHA. 
 
Shelter 
------- 
 
¶16. (SBU) An OCHA-led preliminary rapid assessment on 
shelters is almost completed, with data collected on 48 of 69 
neighborhoods. 
 
International Organizations in Gaza 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶17. (SBU) OCHA reported on January 28 that 30 international 
NGO representatives and approximately 22 UN international 
staff are in Gaza.  Currently, there are outstanding requests 
for more than 200 aid workers to enter Gaza. 
 
Cash/Liquidity 
-------------- 
 
¶18. (SBU) The GOI agreed on January 30 to allow banks in Gaza 
to exchange NIS 10 million (USD 2.5 million) of old, unusable 
currency for new notes, according to the Palestine Monetary 
Authority.  However, this does not change the overall 
liquidity situation of the banks in Gaza.
