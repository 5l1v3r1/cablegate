SUBJECT: CAMBODIA: FOUR FUNCINPEC GOVERNORS SACKED, 
PRESSURE ON FUNCINPEC CONTINUES TO MOUNT 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Citing incompetence and corruption, Prime Minister 
Hun Sen last week removed four FUNCINPEC provincial governors 
from their posts, and promised to remove any others who 
permitted illegal logging to continue in their provinces or 
who could not resolve land disputes.  Additional pressure on 
FUNCINPEC came as Prince Norodom Ranariddh and his mistress, 
Ouk Phalla, had their pictures splashed on the front pages of 
two Khmer language daily newspapers and two biweekly 
magazines.  These latest developments continue to denigrate 
FUNCINPEC as a political party and Ranariddh as a leader, but 
the party does not seem ready to crash yet.  End Summary. 
 
FUNCINPEC's Fortunes Take Another Drop 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Late last week Prime Minister Hun Sen removed four 
FUNCINPEC-appointed provincial governors from their posts, 
citing incompetence and corruption, and replaced them all 
with members of his own Cambodia People's Party (CPP).  Kuch 
Moly, governor of Odar Meanchey province, was replaced by 
Pich Sokhi, formerly the Third Deputy Governor of Siem Reap 
province.  Sim Son, governor of Siem Reap province, was 
replaced by Sou Phirin, formerly governor of Takeo province. 
Lao Sun Pa, governor of Kandal province, was replaced by Khim 
Bo, formerly First Deputy Governor of Kandal province.  Heng 
Chantha, governor of Banteay Meanchey province, was replaced 
by An Sum, formerly the First Deputy Governor of Banteay 
Meanchey province.  The First Deputy Governor of Phnom Penh, 
Mam Bun Neang, was also removed from his position.  Of the 
five, three were assigned to new positions within the 
government.  Lao Sun Pa and Heng Chantha were both moved to 
the Ministry of Interior, while Sim Son was appointed as a 
State Secretary for Rural Development. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  In a speech given in Siem Reap province on Monday, 
March 27, Hun Sen warned that he would remove any provincial 
governors who would not enforce the logging ban or resolve 
land disputes in their provinces.  In his speech the PM 
singled out former governor of Siem Reap, Sim Son, as being 
hesitant to enforce laws, hence he was removed.  Hun Sen also 
reiterated that unqualified officials who purchased their 
positions would be rooted out and replaced with qualified 
personnel. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The assault against FUNCINPEC party leader Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh also continued, with photos of Ranariddh 
and his mistress, Ouk Phalla, gracing the front pages of 
Rasmei Kampuchea as well as Kampuchea Thmei, a pro-CPP paper. 
 The news stories contained information about Phalla and her 
family, as well as the well-circulated rumors that Ranariddh 
made political appointments suggested by his mistress, and 
claims of multiple properties owned by the pair.  Two 
biweekly magazines also included Ouk Phalla's biographical 
information and articles about her illicit relationship with 
Ranariddh. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The CPP is continuing to beat down FUNCINPEC and 
its beleaguered leader.  While Prime Minister Hun Sen is 
cloaking his actions under the guise of fighting corruption, 
the fact remains that only FUNCINPEC officials are being 
purged.  While FUNCINPEC officials have expressed concern 
about the future of their party, many mix that concern with 
continuing complaints about Ranariddh's poor stewardship. 
One FUNCINPEC Minister with close CPP connections told us he 
expects the purge of FUNCINPEC officials to end soon, now 
that the PM has taught Ranariddh a lesson.  Most observers 
think FUNCINPEC will still limp forward.  End Comment.
