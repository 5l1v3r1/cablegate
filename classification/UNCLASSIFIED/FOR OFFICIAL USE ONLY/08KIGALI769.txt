REF: KIGALI 754 
 
(SBU)  VIM Airlines began its airlift of Rwandan soldiers to 
Darfur on October 27.  It has contracted to fly two of the 
four battalions scheduled for rotation to Darfur, and will 
take approximately two weeks to do so, flying 17 flights with 
88 soldiers per flight.  While it does not yet have a 
contract in place from the UN to do the follow-on rotation of 
the remaining two battalions, it believes it is 
well-positioned to do so.  It is also seeking to add 
additional soldiers for each flight.
