¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel points to Georg Klussmann 
of the German Foreign Ministry's Office of International 
Human Rights.  Klussmann said he had already heard about Dr. 
Lake's nomination via the German PermRep in New York.  As the 
position is not an elected one, however, he said he was 
unsure what exactly the U.S. was asking Germany to do. 
Econoff responded that at this point the U.S. was informing 
major donor countries and countries represented on UNICEF's 
Executive Board of Dr. Lake's strong qualifications as well 
as the support of the U.S. for his nomination.  Klussman said 
the German government did not yet have a position on the 
nomination, but would be in contact once internal discussions 
had taken place.  Econoff shared a copy of Mr. Lake's CV with 
Klussmann, who promised to circulate it within the German 
government.
