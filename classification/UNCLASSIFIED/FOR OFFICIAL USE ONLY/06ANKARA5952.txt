ATTEMPT TO WITHDRAW AL-QADI APPEAL 
 
REF: A. ANKARA 5440 
 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 147545 
 
¶1. (SBU) On October 12, the Administrative Chamber of the 
Danistay (Council of State) rejected the Government's 
application to withdraw its appeal of the al-Qadi case. As 
explained reftel, the Government (Prime Ministry and MFA) had 
filed appeals of the Danistay's July 20 ruling that 
invalidated the Council of Ministers' 2001 freeze of 
al-Qadi's assets.  However, Prime Minister Erdogan later 
instructed his subordinates to withdraw the appeal (i.e. let 
the July 20 pro-al-Qadi ruling stand).  It is this 
application that the Administrative Chamber has now rejected. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) A judge from the Administrative Chamber told us that 
the Chamber's action will allow the appeal process to go 
forward and that al-Qadi's assets remain frozen in the 
meantime.  During a thirty-day comment period, the Government 
or al-Qadi have an opportunity to comment, and the 
Administrative Chamber will then begin to consider the 
appeal.  MFA officials were unsure how long the appeals 
process would take. The Administrative Chamber cited the 
public interest in rejecting the withdrawal. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: MFA officials were relieved that the court 
had allowed the appeal to go forward, thereby avoiding a 
situation in which the Prime Minister's action would have put 
Turkey out of compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 
¶1267.  The danger of such non-compliance remains, however, 
albeit at a later date, should the appeals court uphold the 
July 20 decision and unfreeze the assets. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action request: In a meeting prior to the 
Administrative Chamber's latest decision, MFA Director 
General for Legal Affairs Cinar Aldemir was very interested 
in the possibility of additional information from U.S. 
experts on the issues of designation and listing, as well as 
de-listing under 1267 committee procedures. In particular, he 
is interested in how to strike a balance between deterring 
the financing of terrorism and human rights and due process 
concerns.  Given Aldemir and others' interest and the global 
implications of a court reversal of a 1267 freeze in Turkey, 
post requests a USG presentation on this topic, as offered in 
ref b.
