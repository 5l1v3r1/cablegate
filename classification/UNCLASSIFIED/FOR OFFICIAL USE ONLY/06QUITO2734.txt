¶1.  (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel demarches on anti-Israel 
bias in resolutions dealing with Lebanon and resolutions 
extending the mandate of three anti-Israel entities to MFA 
Director General for Multilateral Affairs Lourdes Puma on 
October 31.  Puma said Ecuador had always supported the 
entities listed in Ref A and would continue to vote in favor 
of extending their mandate.  Instructions had been sent to 
Ecuador's NY PermRep Diego Cordova in this regard.  Puma 
thanked us for USG views, saying the GOE was always willing 
to review its position and would take our views into account. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) With respect to the resolutions on Lebanon 
introduced by Cuba (Ref B), Puma professed that she had no 
knowledge of them and would review the text provided by 
PolOff.  In a follow-up meeting on November 8, Puma said that 
Ecuador was hopeful that negotiations with the European Union 
would insert some "equilibrium" into the resolutions.  When 
pressed as to whether Ecuador would support the resolutions 
as written, Puma said that certainly Ecuador could not vote 
against the Lebanese children and added that Ecuador supports 
the activities of the Non-Aligned Movement.  She again 
reiterated, however, that she was hopeful the negotiations 
over the language would balance the resolutions.
