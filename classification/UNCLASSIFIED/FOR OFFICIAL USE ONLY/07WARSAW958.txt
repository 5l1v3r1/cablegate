REF: STATE 47346 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Foreign Minister Fotyga informed visiting 
Secretary of Defense Gates April 25 that she will attend the 
 
SIPDIS 
May 3 ICI meeting.  She also said that she was endeavoring to 
do what she could on Iraq debt, but repeated several times 
that debt forgiveness would be very difficult given Poland's 
EU-imposed budget deficit restrictions and the political 
difficulty raised by having to explain the situation to the 
public.  This view was also expressed recently in DCM's 
separate meeting with Ministry of Finance Under Secretary 
Katarzyna Zajdel-Kurowska. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Comment:  Given Poland's military commitment to 
Iraq, we do not expect any further announcements on its part 
at the ICI.  However, the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs continue to look at the issue.
