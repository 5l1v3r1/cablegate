¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Mission reviewed Ref A points with the 
GOI on April 25.  Mission encouraged the GOI to commit a 
second tranche of Indonesian National Police to Darfur and to 
take advantage of the special training offered at the COESPU 
facility in Vicenza, Italy, in July.   The Indonesian 
government responded that it is planning to send a second 
tranche of police to Darfur and is seriously considering the 
COESPU offer.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On April 27, Poloff delivered reftel points to 
Fikry Cassidy, Deputy Director for International Security at 
the Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU).  Poloff reiterated 
USG support for Indonesia's contribution of stabilization 
police to UNAMID in Darfur (ref B) and underscored the need 
for further contributions from the international community. 
Cassidy stated that the GOI remained fully committed to 
supporting UNAMID and was happy that it could make a 
contribution to the UNAMID force.  (note:  The first tranche 
of INP peacekeepers is scheduled to depart for Darfur in late 
May.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Poloff also noted that Indonesia could take 
advantage of a targeted training course given at the Center 
for Excellence for Stability Police Units (COESPU) in 
Vicenza, Italy, in July.  The course is for police going to 
Darfur.  This would be the first targeted COESPU course for 
countries planning to deploy formed police units for a 
particular mission.  Cassidy noted that the GOI is familiar 
with COESPU and would seriously review the offer. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Cassidy informed poloff on April 30 that the 
Indonesian police planned to send a second tranche of 
officers to Darfur in 2009 and was creating a list of 15 
proposed candidates for the proposed COESPU training.  He 
said every effort would be made to submit the list requesting 
the training by the May 5 deadline.
