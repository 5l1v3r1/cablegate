SUBJECT: PARAMARIBO - DEMARCHE: ADVANCING THE US POSITION 
FOR CHANGE IN CUBA 
 
REF: 08 STATE 18320 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Regretably, and despite numerous attempts, 
Ambassador was unable to contact high level GOS Foreign 
Ministry officials on Sunday, February 24, to deliver reftel 
demarche points.  However, Ambassador did succeed in 
contacting MFA Permanent Secretary Jane Aarland-Nanhu on 
February 25.  In response to the Ambassador's comments with 
respect to Cuba's undemocratic leadership transition, PermSec 
Aarland-Nanhu confirmed that she well understood the USG 
position with regard to democracy in Cuba.  She also agreed 
that there was no surprise in the announcement that Raul 
Castro would succeed his brother, Fidel.  Ambassador observed 
that, given Suriname's experience with the 1980's 
dictatorship of Desi Bouterse, as well as anecdotal evidence 
that at least some among the Surinamese people recognized 
that Cuba's leadership transition could not be characterized 
as "democratic", she hoped that the GOS would include a 
statement advocating true democracy in Cuba in any 
post-"election" message that Suriname might send to the GOC. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In respnse to the Ambassador's request, PermSec 
Aarland-Nanhu noted that she would first need to consult with 
Foreign Minister Kraag-Keteldijk, who has been traveling. 
The Permanent Secretary promised to advise the Ambassador of 
the GOS position on any possible statement on democracy in 
Cuba after her meeting with the Minister. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment: Given past experience, as well as internal 
GOS politics (the Health Minister, whose political party is a 
member of the ruling coalition, is especially close to the 
GOC), it is doubtful that the GOS will see its way clear to 
issue any statement with respect to democracy in Cuba. 
Nevertheless, Post will continue to pursue the issue and 
report any developments septel.  End Comment.
