¶1. (SBU)  On May 9, Poloff conveyed Ref A points to Wendy 
Edgar, Acting Manager, International Sector Policy 
Directorate, Ministry of Health (see Ref B).  In Edgar's 
response May 12, she reported that GNZ's "stance on variola 
virus is largely consistent with the U.S. position.  We will 
be supporting retention of the variola virus for research 
purposes with the proviso that it is maintained in a safe 
environment.  Our support for research into improved vaccine 
and antiviral drugs is contingent on the use of research 
methods that avoid the use of live variola virus, development 
of hybrid viruses, transport of variola DNA, and other such 
potentially hazardous laboratory practices." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Edgar further provided the following related text 
from the delegation briefing notes: "The areas of permissible 
research sought by WHO's Variola Advisory Committee (VAC) 
include distribution of variola DNA between laboratories, and 
genetic engineering involving variola virus DNA and other 
orthopox viruses.  This type of activity is not without risk. 
 Consideration of laboratory safety has been raised as a 
proposed resolution under pandemic preparedness (WHA 13.9) 
with regard to three SARS laboratory accidents in the past 
two years.  New Zealand supports increased vigilance (sic) to 
laboratory safety.  The WHO Director General appreciated the 
need for development of antiviral drugs and vaccines without 
using the live variola virus and recommended that the VAC 
reconsider research on variola viruses, in light of biosafety 
and biosecurity concerns, at its next meeting." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Minister of Health Pete Hodgson will lead New 
Zealand's delegation to the World Health Assembly in Geneva, 
Edgar said.  Deputy Director General of Public Health Don 
Matheson will lead the delegation after Hodgson departs. 
Chief Advisor of Public Health, Dr. Ashley Bloomfield, will 
also attend.
