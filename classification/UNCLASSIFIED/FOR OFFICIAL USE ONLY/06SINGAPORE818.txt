TRILATERAL PILOT PROJECT MEETING 
 
REF: JAKARTA 03199 
 
¶1. (U) Representatives from the United States, Indonesia, and 
Singapore met jointly for the first time March 2 in Singapore 
to discuss preparations for the Indonesian Avian Influenza 
Trilateral Pilot Project.  The World Bank, World Health 
Organization (WHO), World Organization for Animal Health 
(OIE), and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO) joined in additional meetings held March 3.  While they 
did not resolve all issues pertaining to financial and 
technical assistance, participants agreed to begin 
implementation of the project as early as April (reftel). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Delegates, particularly those from the USG, 
expressed concerns about the implementation process, 
specifically: 
 
--The proposal does not address early warning and detection 
in poultry farms. 
 
--The proposal envisions only limited participation by 
veterinary and agricultural officials and allocates 
disproportionate funding to the human health sector for what 
is essentially an animal disease initiative. 
 
--Indonesian human health and animal health agencies lack 
coordination. 
 
--International agencies lack coordination on other 
AI-related initiatives already underway in Indonesia. 
 
--The absence of a firm boundary to separate Tangerang 
Municipality (where the pilot project will take place) from 
the much larger and more populous Tangerang District makes 
disease control problematic. 
 
--"Lessons learned" need to be applied well before the 
project's evaluation phase commences in 2.5 years. 
 
¶3. (U) The AI Trilateral Project, first proposed by Singapore 
and announced by Foreign Minister George Yeo and Secretary 
Rice on the sidelines of the November 2005 APEC Economic 
Leader's meeting in Pusan, Korea, aims to eradicate avian 
influenza within a defined geographic region of Indonesia. 
Based on lessons learned during the pilot project, the 
Government of Indonesia hopes to replicate similar AI 
prevention initiatives in other affected areas of the 
country.  Singapore and Indonesia officials held bilateral 
meetings in December and January to determine the scope of 
the project and to develop a three-year implementation and 
evaluation timeline.
