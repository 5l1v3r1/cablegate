SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) This cable contains an action request. Please 
see paragraph (5). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Multi-National Force - Iraq (MNF-I) has 
provided the Embassy with the following update on the 
two Palestinian detainees in Coalition custody named 
in Reftel. This update may be passed to 
representatives of the Palestinian Authority in its 
entirety: 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Jayyab Mahmoud Hasan Ehmedat (ISN No. 
106593) has been fully approved for release by the 
Iraqi-majority Combined Review and Release Board 
(CRRB) and by MNF-I. However, the release of third- 
country nationals in Iraq also requires the formal 
approval of the Iraqi Prime Minister or Ministry of 
Justice. Mr. Ehmedat's release is one of approximately 
forty now awaiting MOJ approval; the Palestinian 
Mission in Baghdad may wish to contact the Iraqi MOJ 
regarding this matter. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Osama Feysa Mohammed (ISN No. 172700) was 
provisionally approved for release on July 11, 2005 by 
the CRRB and MNF-I. However, Embassy Baghdad has been 
requested to seek confirmation of his employment in 
the Palestinian Authority Security Services prior to 
his referral to the Iraqi MOJ for final approval.
