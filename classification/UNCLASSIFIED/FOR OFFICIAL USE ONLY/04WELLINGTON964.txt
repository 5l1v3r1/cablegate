SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE TO REQUEST ON NEGOTIATIONS 
UNDER GLOBAL AGREEMENT TO PROTECT OZONE LAYER 
 
REF: STATE 245175 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post provided reftel points to Emma Kerslake, 
Environment Division, New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade (MFAT.)  MFAT noted that they would respond 
following consultations with the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Forestry (MAF.)  AgAttache spoke separately with MAF 
Biosecurity officers Peter Johnston and Ken Glassey, who 
pointed out that the MBTOC has recommended a reduction in New 
Zealand's 2006 Critical Use Exemption (CUE) request.  New 
Zealand is not likely to press at the meeting for its higher 
requested volume for Methyl Bromide (MB) usage. 
 
Methyl Bromide in New Zealand 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) MAF officials emphasized that the Montreal Protocol's 
restrictions on the utilization of MB impact only on 
unofficial uses and do not apply to official control or 
quarantine usage.  In New Zealand approximately 70 percent of 
all MB application is for quarantine control, with most 
applied to forestry exports and produce.  Only about 30 
percent of usage is "unofficial," and would be governed by 
the Montreal Protocol's restrictions. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The most important use of unofficial MB is on 
strawberry fields.  In studying the issue, MAF found that 
some applications, particularly to virgin fields not 
previously producing strawberries, was unnecessary - it was 
being applied as a weed control system versus a pathogen 
control system.  Reduction of this unnecessary application 
should allow the GoNZ to meet the lower 2006 usage level 
being recommended by MBTOC.  However, should those harvested 
strawberries be treated with MB as a quarantine measure prior 
to export, this application would be official, and fall 
outside the purview of the Montreal Protocol. 
 
Concern over "Official Use" Impact 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Largely due to the GoNZ's ability to live 
with its lowered target, the U.S. should not count on strong 
support from New Zealand.  On a related front, an Auckland 
study released November 2 found that 4,872 residential 
properties may be located on premises previously used for 
horticulture, and the soil may still contain contaminants. 
While contamination concerns are varied, they include 
chemical applications for both pests and weeds, including 
methyl bromide.  The findings have resulted in increased 
pressure on the GoNZ to test all the named sites and develop 
a national process for identifying and testing potentially 
contaminated sites. Given this controversy, it seems even 
less likely that New Zealand will take a high-profile stand 
on MB limits at the meeting. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The GoNZ's posture at the Prague meeting November 
22-26 will likely be one of monitoring approaches taken by 
other countries rather than a pro-active stance on the issue. 
 However, the GoNZ may be sympathetic to USG rationale 
concerning technical and economic considerations because of 
their concern that the Montreal Protocol's restrictions may 
at some point be extended to official quarantine usage, which 
would particularly effect NZ's exports to the EU.  We believe 
New Zealand is therefore unlikely to criticize the U.S. 
position at the meeting, even if it is equally likely not to 
publicly support us.  End Comment.
