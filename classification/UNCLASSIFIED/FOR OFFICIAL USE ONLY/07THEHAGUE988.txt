¶1.  (U)  Econoff delivered reftel points May 23 to Dutch 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) officials Joan Wiegman, 
Deputy Head, Nuclear Affairs and Non-Proliferation Division, 
and Huib Mijnarends, Senior Policy Officer on Iran Sanctions 
within the MFA's Terrorism and New Threats Unit. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Wiegman said there were "almost no" Dutch arms 
exports to Iran, and that the GONL was fully behind the EU's 
"united front" supporting full implementation of UN Security 
Council Resolutions and the P5 plus 1 offer.  The Dutch, she 
added, also supported the arms embargo adopted by the EU in 
its April 23 Common Position (CP) that incorporated UNSCR 
¶1747. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Wiegman noted the GONL had submitted its 1747 
report to the UN the week of May 14.  While the EU had still 
to develop implementing regulations for the CP, she added, 
UNSCR 1747 requirements had already been incorporated into 
Dutch law.  The Dutch, therefore, considered the CP and its 
implementing regulations as "only formalities," she said. 
 
MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
