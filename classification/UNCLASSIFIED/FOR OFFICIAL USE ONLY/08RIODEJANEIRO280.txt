CONTRACTS 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
¶1.  (U) Jose Sergio Gabrielli, President of Brazil's 
state-controlled oil and gas company Petrobras, said October 7 that 
the company would not renegotiate with the Government of Ecuador on 
its oil production in the country.  The statement was made during 
the inauguration of Petrobras' P-51 platform in the Campos Basin 
deepwater "Marlim Sul" field off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state. 
It was Gabrielli's first official statement after Ecuador's 
President Rafael Correa threatened to expel Petrobras from his 
country if the company did not renegotiate on new terms of oil 
production. 
 
¶2.  (U) In early September, Correa ordered the renegotiation of the 
contracts with all foreign oil companies which currently exploit 
half of the country's oil fields and keep 82 percent of the 
revenues.  France's Repsol-YFP, Spain's Perenco and China's Andes 
Petroleum have already agreed to change their contracts.  Under the 
new contract, Ecuador keeps the oil production by paying for the 
production costs as well as a share of the profits. 
 
¶3.  (U) Petrobras has a very limited presence in Ecuador -- only one 
exploration block and one production block with average daily output 
of 10,400 barrels per day.  That accounts for less than 0.5% of the 
company's total production. 
 
¶4.  (U) Brazil's President Lula, who also attended the Petrobras 
platform inauguration, said the government was not taking part in 
the negotiations, but government departments might join the 
discussion if necessary.  Lula stressed that though the problem is 
minor, Petrobras could reconsider its position about its operations 
in Ecuador.  He said, "If there is an agreement, great.  If not, 
Petrobras will find another way, and Ecuador will find new 
partners." 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment: Petrobras was probably considering pulling out of 
Ecuador anyway, for purely business reasons, so that it can focus 
resources here in Brazil.  On October 2, Petrobras Global Business 
Manager Samir Awad told State Department Undersecretary for 
Economic, Energy, and Agricultural Affairs Reuben Jeffery that the 
company will likely pull back on many of its international 
operations with the exception of investments in the U.S., Argentina, 
Nigeria and Angola.  He said that Petrobras will probably pull out 
completely from Libya, India, Tanzania, and Pakistan.  Given the 
Petrobras' relatively minor interests in Ecuador, it appears that 
the Government of Brazil will not intervene in Petrobras' business 
decisions like it has previously done on deals with countries such 
as Venezuela and Bolivia.  We do not expect Petrobras to renegotiate 
its contracts in Ecuador, and could see the company pull out from 
Ecuador in the near future.  What implications the GOB may draw from 
the oil industry's response to Ecuador's changes as Brazil considers 
its own plans for oil sector restructuring remains to be seen.  End 
Comment.
