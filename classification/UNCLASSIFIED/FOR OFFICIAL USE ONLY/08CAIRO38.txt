1.(SBU)  Summary:  During a meeting on January 3, Sherif 
Issa, legal advisor to Egypt's Foreign Minister, complained 
to us about the treatment Egyptian national Ahmed Abdellatif 
Sherif Mohamed, one of the two Egyptian University of South 
Florida students being held on terrorism charges in Tampa, is 
receiving.  While thanking the USG for facilitating the 
recent visit of Abdellatif's parents to the U.S. to see their 
son, Issa warned that the conditions of his pre-trial 
confinement could be turning him in to an extremist. 
According to Sherif, Egypt's Ministry Of Foreign Affairs is 
not following the case of Abdellatif,s co-defendant, Yousef 
Samir Megahed, because he is a green card holder and has a 
very supportive and vocal family in the U.S. End Summary. 
 
2.(SBU)  Issa opened by thanking us for facilitating the 
travel of Abdellatif,s mother and father to the U.S. in 
December.  He praised the Embassy for issuing visas to the 
parents in "no time."  He said Abdellatif,s parents were 
treated well in the U.S. and were especially grateful that 
they were permitted to visit their son in a room without bars 
or other dividers. 
 
3.(SBU)  Issa then turned to the conditions of Abdellatif's 
pre-trial confinement. He said Abdellatif's parents, and the 
MFA, are concerned about his physical and mental health. 
According to Issa, Abdellatif is held in solitary 
confinement.  (Note: Jail officials told Abdellatif,s 
GOE-financed lawyer that this is for his protection.  End 
note.)  Issa said this is putting great mental strain on 
Abdellatif, that he is "losing his judgment," and now devotes 
his days to prayer.  Issa fears that if Abdellatif is found 
innocent and is not now a terrorist, this experience will 
have turned him in to one.  He also complained that 
Abdellatif is a "big eater" and is not receiving sufficient 
food. Issa said he has no comment on Abdellatif,s guilt or 
innocence (although he said that the "fireworks" found in his 
car may have been "understandable" given that Abdellatif was 
on his way to "celebrate his birthday with friends"), but 
asked if a way could be found to ease the conditions of his 
confinement. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Issa also said that the legal process seems to be 
moving slowly.  Issa said that Egypt is often criticized for 
holding terrorism suspects for long periods without trial (he 
used Congressional criticism of the draft anti-terrorism law 
as an example), and said it would be hard for the Egyptian 
press and public to see the difference between Abdellatif,s 
situation and those for which Egypt is often criticized. 
(Note:  We asked if Abdullatif's lawyer had requested that 
the case be brought quickly to trial.  Issa conceded that the 
lawyer had in fact requested a delay.  End note.)  He said 
that to date, media coverage of the case has been limited in 
Egypt because Abdellatif's parents have not spoken out, 
fearing publicity could harm their son's case. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Comment:  We frequently raise cases of jailed 
oppositionists, such as Ayman Nour, with the MFA.  The MFA 
may be using Abdellatif's case as a counterpoint to our 
approaches on human rights issues.  Nonetheless, Issa 
appeared genuinely concerned about potential negative public 
perceptions of the case in Egypt.
