Â¶1.  (SBU)  On October 25, EmbOff met with Smiljana Knez, head 
of the MFA's Human Rights Unit, to urge Slovenia to vote 
against, or, at a minimum, abstain on the annual UNGA 
resolution introduced by Cuba condemning the U.S. economic 
embargo against Cuba, per reftel.  EmbOff also asked that the 
GOS deliver a robust Explanation of Vote expressing its 
concerns about the human rights situation in Cuba and the 
need for a democratic transition.  Knez explained that 
Slovenia would maintain its consistent policy on Cuba issues, 
in line with a common EU policy.  She stated that, therefore, 
Slovenia will vote in favor of the UNGA resolution to end the 
U.S. economic embargo against Cuba.  Knez said that the GOS 
would not commit to deliver an Explanation of Vote on the 
resolution, but noted that Slovenia has consistently voiced 
its concerns about the human rights situation in Cuba.
