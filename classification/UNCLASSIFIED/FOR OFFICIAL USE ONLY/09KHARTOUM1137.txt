OBJECTIVES 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 944 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary. On September 27 and 28, South Kordofan's 
ICC-indicted Governor, Ahmed Mohamed Haroun (NCP) and his SPLM 
deputy Abdel Aziz Al Helou, hosted a meeting in Kadugli for donors 
and UN partners. Subjects discussed included recent progress in 
South Kordofan, his government's near-term peace and development 
objectives, and how attendees can contribute toward these achieving 
these objective.  Whatever the motive behind Haroun's proactive 
leadership and development initiatives, his connections to Khartoum 
and ability to rally donor support should bring some peace dividends 
to South Kordofan prior to April, 2010 elections.  End Summary 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Verbal and Financial Support From Khartoum 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) Discussing recent progress, Haroun stated that his government 
had the support of the Government of National Unity (GNU)  He added 
that the latter had emphasized that South Kordofan's government 
should not be constrained by conflicts occurring between GNU 
partners the National Congress Party (NCP) and the Sudan People's 
Liberation Movement (SPLM).  He noted his government had received 
SDG 150 million from the federal government, which had been 
allocated for infrastructure projects, particularly roads.  Haroun 
stated that work on a cumulative total of 970 kilometers of roads is 
underway. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Salary Shortfalls and Government Expansion 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (U) Haroun told the group that the federal government is 
providing SDG 7.5 million for state salaries, but that there is 
still a deficit of SDG 4.5 million.  He said that this salary 
deficit was being funded by using the state's oil revenues. (Note: 
Pursuant to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, at least two percent 
of oil revenue is allocated to the state or region in which such oil 
is produced. End Note.)  Haroun noted that this situation is not 
ideal, as South Kordofan's citizens were not seeing the hoped-for 
benefits from oil production.  However,  Haroun said, the state was 
working on reforming the civil service to reduce its size without 
compromising its ability to provide needed services.  Haroun said 
that he hoped to end the use of oil resources for salaries by the 
end of the year. 
 
¶4.  (U) Haroun discussed the creation of four state capitals, namely 
Kadugli, Al Fula, Kauda and Abu Jubeiha, and the increase of 
localities from nine to nineteen, which he said would increase 
security and the effectiveness of services by putting the government 
closer to the people.  Haroun explained that this expansion will not 
necessarily compromise his government's efforts to reduce the 
state's budget deficit, as the integration of civil servants from 
the NCP and SPLM will provide all the staff needed in the new 
localities.  The only increase in staff will be the number of 
locality Commissioners.  He noted, however, that his government had 
cut the salaries of all Ministers and Commissioners by half, which 
will assist in meeting the salary needs of the additional 
Commissioners. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Expanded Access for UN and NGOs Promised 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Repeating their message from the donor meeting with Haroun 
on August 8 (ref), international donors emphasized that improved 
access to and within South Kordofan is crucial for donors to provide 
effective assistance.  Haroun initially deflected these concerns, 
stating that government and security officials become suspicious of 
international organizations' agendas when the presence of such 
organizations does not result in sufficient, visible development. 
However, Haroun did recommit to providing all required access to 
ensure effective donor aid.  He also announced approval for a UN 
office in Muglad, noting that this new office will face significant 
challenges due to the high expectations of the community in and 
around Muglad.  (Note: Access to Muglad has been particularly 
restricted.  Muglad is in the heartland of the Misseryia, an Arab 
nomadic tribe that acted as Khartoum's most effective proxy in the 
North/South war, but whose members reportedly have become restless 
and discontented with Khartoum's treatment since the war's end in 
¶2005. End Note.)  Donors responded positively to this unexpected 
announcement and expressed their thanks. 
 
¶6.  (U) Haroun also announced that his government had established a 
"Foreign and National Aid Coordination Committee" that  would look 
 
KHARTOUM 00001137  002 OF 002 
 
 
at ways of increasing the number of donor partners in the state.  He 
stated that a key challenge for this committee is to increase local 
NGO capacity, and suggested that one way of achieving this is for 
local NGOs to be partnered in their day-to-day work with 
international NGOs and UN agencies. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Government/UN/NGOs To Coordinate Efforts 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (U) Meeting attendees agreed on the formation of a ten person 
team, consisting of five members from the government of South 
Kordofan and five members from the international community, to 
coordinate development efforts.  Those in attendance also agreed 
that given the limited time available, the team should focus on 
strengthening existing programs and mechanisms.  The team was tasked 
with submitting a project proposal within a month, at which time the 
governor and deputy governor will be in Khartoum for follow up 
meetings. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Peace Dividends Central to Successful Elections 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶8.  (U) Haroun said that the highest priority of the 2010 elections 
should be ensuring peace in the future. Post-civil war peace 
dividends should provide tangible development, which in turn will 
facilitate peaceful and successful elections.  Haroun noted that 
while the technical issues of running elections were important, they 
were currently a lesser government priority. 
 
------------------------------ 
Returnees's Problems Imaginary 
------------------------------ 
 
¶9.  (U) Addressing problems encountered by returnees attempting to 
access their land and homes, Haroun stated that these were only 
"imaginary" or "conceptual" problems.  He said that pursuant to 
traditional customs and habits in Kordofan, people helped each 
other, including with access to land.  He added that a committee was 
already in place and was looking at the establishment of a land 
commission, which would deal with land related problems. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Comment: Despite the ICC indictment and his fearsome 
reputation for brutality during the north-south war, Haroun 
continues to impress international actors with his successful 
partnership with his SPLM deputy and his pro-active governance of 
South Kordofan.  Whatever the motive behind his actions, Haroun's 
connections to Khartoum and ability to rally donor support should 
bring some tangible peace dividends to South Kordofan prior to 
elections and popular consultations.  End Comment.
