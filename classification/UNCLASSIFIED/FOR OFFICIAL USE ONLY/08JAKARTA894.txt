1.(SBU)  This is an action request.  See paragraph 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Dr. Widjaja Lukito, Ministry of Health lead negotiator for 
sample sharing, told us on May 6 that he would like to continue 
sample sharing negotiations by video teleconference (VTC) either the 
morning of May 8 or May 9. He is proposing a 7:00 a.m. (Jakarta) 
start time which would allow Australia to participate at 10:00 a.m. 
(Canberra time) along with Washington (8:00 p.m.)  Widjaja is 
departing Indonesia on May 10 and will not be returning until May 
¶26. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Widjaja suggested that VTC discussions take up where the 
Sydney March 17-19 talks concluded and that the same agenda items be 
discussed.  But he stressed the importance of including the renaming 
of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance 
Network (GISN) to reflect the fact that the system will be 
different.  Indonesia proposes that the system be renamed to the WHO 
Influenza Network (WIN).  According to Widjaja, Indonesia's 
priorities on benefits sharing are tiered pricing and a global 
vaccine stockpile (whether real or virtual) that guarantees 
developing countries access to vaccine at affordable prices. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Widjaja indicated he will ask that someone from Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs attend the VTC along with another representative 
from the Ministry of Health. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Action requested: please inform us whether we should 
arrange the proposed VTC on May 8 or May 9 Jakarta time.
