(SBU) On May 17, Post's Environment Specialist discussed reftel 
talking points with Maria Korznikova, Chief of the Renewable Energy 
Section at the Russian Ministry of Energy.  Korznikova said that the 
Ministry has not arrived at a position on joining IRENA or on the 
choice of the agency's headquarters or Director General.  The 
Ministry is aware of the June 28-30 International Renewable Energy 
Agency (IRENA) preparatory meeting in Egypt but has not received an 
invitation and, given the late date, is unlikely to attend.  Russian 
representatives also did not take part in the founding meeting in 
January because they received the invitation too late.  Korznikova 
said that Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, who oversees the energy 
sector, is aware of the preparations and asked the Energy Ministry 
for further information on it in December.  However, Ministry 
officials would prefer to make decisions on Russian participation in 
IRENA only after discussion with other potential members.
