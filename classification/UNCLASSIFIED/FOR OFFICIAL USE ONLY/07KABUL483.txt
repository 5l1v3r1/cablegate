SUBJECT: PRT JALALABAD:  NEW OFFICIALS REINVIGORATE DIAG 
PROCESS 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary:  New DIAG Regional Director visited 
the PRT to describe plans for new initiatives to 
reinvigorate the DIAG process.  Two weeks later, DIAG 
hosted an event in Jalalabad for former Mujahideen. 
While the meetings were encouraging, getting new 
momentum for DIAG will require hard work and 
coordination.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Dr. Abdul Hameed Omar, the new DIAG Director 
for the Eastern Region, came to the PRT on January 21 
to discuss recent changes made in the process to try 
to regain momentum.  He admitted that the pace has 
slowed down since the burst of enthusiasm 
when DDR ended and DIAG began.  He explained that the 
new focus will be on specific districts, rather than 
whole provinces.  Any district that can reach a 
certain level of compliance will be eligible for up to 
$100,000 of grant money for development projects, 
which will hopefully encourage neighboring districts 
to follow suit.  The PRT pledged to support the new 
initiative, and came up with a list of activities on 
which we could work together. 
 
¶3.  (U) Two weeks later, Jalalabad PRT Officials 
attended a meeting of former Mujahideen commanders 
sponsored by the Nangarhar Provincial Shura and DIAG 
officials.  Over 200 persons identifying themselves as 
Mujahideen attended the meeting, organized to promote 
the DIAG process and encourage former Mujahideen to 
turn in their weapons.  The UN Weapons Recovery Team 
display outside the meeting of 50 boxes of ammunition 
that had been recently turned in was nevertheless 
rather uinspiring. 
 
¶4.  (U) Several influential Mujahideen spoke, 
including the former Afghan Army 11th Division 
Commander Ustas Mohammad Ali Malanyar (who has been 
suggested as the possible replacement for recently 
departed Deputy Governor Dr. Mohammad Alan Ishaq Zai.) 
Multiple speakers expressed a variety of opinions on 
the topic, with many nostalgically recalling their 
success in fighting against the Soviet Union.  The PRT 
Commander praised them for using their creativity to 
overcome great odds then, and asked that they use it 
now to fight the enemies of peace and stability. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  New DIAG Regional Director Tahir 
seemed enthusiastic, yet realistic, about the 
possibilities for the new initiative.  The Mujahideen 
meeting two weeks later was a lively, high profile way 
to start.  Unfortunately, Tahir missed this first big 
event, as DIAG sent him to Kabul for a Regional 
Director's meeting that day, which is not a good omen 
for future planning and coordination.  End comment.
