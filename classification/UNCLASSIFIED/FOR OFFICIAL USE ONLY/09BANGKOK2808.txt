GOLDSTONE REPORT RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 112828 
 
Â¶1. (SBU)  Poloff conveyed reftel Goldstone report points to 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Department of International 
Organizations official Chonvipat Changtrakul November 4, 
urging Thailand to oppose a U.N. General Assembly resolution 
or other efforts to pressure the Security Council on the 
matter.  Chonvipat replied that the RTG would review 
resolution language closely in order to develop a balanced 
and fair position.  That said, Chonvipat commented that, 
while Thailand understood the precedent that a resolution 
could set if passed, the RTG was likely to abstain or vote in 
favor of a resolution.  By voting in this manner, Thailand's 
position would likely mirror that of Non-Aligned Movement 
nations.  We urged abstention.
