SUBJECT: Peace Corps Agreement Signed With Indonesia 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Undersecretary for Political Affairs William Burns signed 
a Peace Corps agreement with Deputy Minister Bambang Sutedjo of 
Indonesia's National Development Planning Agency (BAPENAS) on 
December 11th.  The agreement opens the way for Peace Corps to 
establish a program in Indonesia after a forty-year absence.  The 
return of Peace Corps to Indonesia signifies a deepening of 
U.S.-Indonesia ties, and advances our progress toward the proposed 
U.S.-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post commends the Peace Corps for its hard work, 
commitment and flexibility in reaching this agreement.  Post also 
expresses gratitude to the many individuals and offices whose 
dedication and professionalism made this agreement possible.  In 
particular, we credit the efforts of Under Secretary Burns, Under 
Secretary Kennedy, the team at EAP/MTS, and Consular Affairs.  We 
also recognize the extraordinary efforts of the Translating Division 
of the Office of Language Services, whose responsiveness and fast 
turnaround proved critical to finalizing the Bahasa Indonesia 
language text in time for Under Secretary Burns to sign during his 
trip to Jakarta.
