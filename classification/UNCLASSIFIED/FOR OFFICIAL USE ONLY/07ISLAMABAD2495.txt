¶1. (SBU) On June 4, PolOff delivered reftel points urging 
Pakistan to weigh in with the UN and the AU on the need for 
UN command and control of the proposed hybrid operation to 
MFA Director (UN-I) Haider Shah.  Shah said that the 
substance of our message made sense, as Pakistan has in the 
past also called for a more unified command in UN 
peacekeeping operations.  He said that failing to resolve 
command and control issues in advance of a hybrid operation 
would be diastrous for the mission.  Shah said that he would 
consult with Pakistan Army headquarters because they would 
have to support any decision to send peacekeepers.  He 
pointed out that the challenges to the hybrid operation were 
political as well as technical, meaning that the AU must be 
seen as an important component of the operation.  Echoing 
what Foreign Secretary Khan said about the Darfur mission 
last month (ref B), Shah concluded that Pakistan would be 
deliberate in deciding how to contribute to a hybrid 
operation.
