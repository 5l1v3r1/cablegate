SUBJECT: CSE RELEASES DRAFT ELECTORAL CALENDAR 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) 
completed a draft calendar with key dates and deadlines for 
the November 5 national elections.  The calendar was recently 
released to the political parties for consultation.  After a 
consensus is reached with the political parties, the CSE will 
publish a final version.  Although the Embassy obtained a 
copy, the calendar is not available to the public -- please 
protect accordingly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The following is a list of key dates indicated on 
the draft calendar: 
 
- April/June 2006: Verification of voter registry and change 
of voting district.  CSE will finalize verification on August 
7, 2006. 
 
- May 5, 2006: Deadline to register alliances of political 
parties. 
 
- May 26-July 20, 2006: Presentation of presidential 
candidates. 
 
- June 1, 2006: Official appointment of the members of the 
Departmental and Regional Electoral Councils. 
 
- June 16, 2006: Official appointment of the members of the 
Municipal Electoral Councils. 
 
- August 7, 2006: Deadline to solicit a cedula (national ID 
card required for voting). 
 
- August 17, 2006: Confirmation of the party and alliance 
casillas on the electoral ballot. 
 
- August 19, 2006: Formal opening of electoral campaign. 
 
- September 6, 2006: Deadline for the completion of requested 
cedulas or supplementary voting documents. 
 
- September 9, 2006: Deadline for inclusion of new voters in 
registry. 
 
- November 1, 2006: Formal close of electoral campaign. 
 
- November 5, 2006: Election Day and transmission of results 
to national computation center. 
 
- November 6, 2006: Publication of preliminary results. 
 
- November 23, 2006: Proclamation of winners (takes place 
after formal complaint/resolution process). 
 
- January 9, 2007: Inauguration of new President and National 
Assembly. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: According to contacts, these dates are 
essentially based on the 2001 electoral calendar.  The May 5 
deadline to register alliances of political parties may prove 
problematic if the Liberal factions ultimately decide to 
participate in multi-party primaries (septel), however, the 
dates are not yet fixed, and the parties could theoretically 
register the alliance with the CSE before holding the 
primaries.
