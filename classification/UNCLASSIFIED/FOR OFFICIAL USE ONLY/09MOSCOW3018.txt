SUBJECT:  MFA AIRS UNSCR 1540 CONCERNS AT EXBS MEETING 
 
¶1.  Begin summary:  On Tuesday, December 8, the EXBS Advisor and 
EXBS Assistant met with representatives of the export controls 
section within the Security and Disarmament Department of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry.  During this meeting, MFA took the 
opportunity to raise concerns about issues related to implementation 
of UNSCR 1540 and arms control compliance - items outside the focus 
of the meeting agenda.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  Present were the Deputy Director of the Security and Disarmament 
Department, Grigory Ivanovich Mashkov; Anatoliy Mikhailovich 
Bulochnikov, Advisor; and Alexander Odoevskiy, Attache.  The purpose 
of the meeting was to receive MFA's feedback on the proposed agenda 
for the February 2-3, 2010 Program Review and February 4 Export 
Licensing Exchange in Washington.  MFA requested that the following 
topics be added to the first day's discussions:  Nuclear Suppliers 
Group; Zangger Committee; Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism; MTCR; Hague Code of Conduct; International Missile 
Experts' Group; Australia Group; Wassenaar Arrangement. 
Additionally, we had sent MFA a summary table of FY08, FY09, and 
FY10 program activities ahead of the meeting for their review and 
approval.  The discussion lasted a little under an hour, and was 
generally productive.

Concerning UNSCR 1540 
---------------------- 
 
¶3.  In the past, MFA has used the occasion of our discussions to 
bring up topics which are not within the strict purview of the EXBS 
program.  Such was the case on this day.  Mashkov spoke about the 
U.S. view on creating a multilateral fund to support implementation 
of UN Security Council Resolution 1540.  Referring to his numerous 
exchanges with the U.S. 1540 Coordinator, Thomas Wuchte, Mashkov 
said he was disappointed that he had only recently received a reply 
to his message sent March 2009 expressing concerns about the 
usefulness and necessity of such a fund.  Mashkov complained that 
the U.S. response was merely a formal reply that did not address the 
Russian side's concerns over justification for use of the money.  He 
said that the fund would be used simply to hire more bureaucrats and 
would not accomplish anything substantive. 
---------------------- 
Concerning compliance 
---------------------- 
 
¶4.  Mr. Mashkov also made a passing comment about the U.S. 2005 arms 
control compliance report, which he characterized as a "complicating 
element" in U.S.-Russian bilateral relations.  He asserted that the 
report accuses Russia of violations which Russia did not commit.  He 
did not provide clarification as to what the alleged violations 
were. 
-------------------------------- 
Concerning MFA personnel changes 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Mashkov told us that Alexander Mikhailovich Deineko, who had 
been serving as head of the export controls section, had been 
promoted to a position with responsibility for military-technical 
cooperation within the Security and Disarmament Department of the 
Foreign Ministry.
