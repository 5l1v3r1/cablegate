(SBU) Per Ref A request, contacts at the International Department of 
the Ministry of Health and Social Development have told us their 
ministry would be in charge of the distribution of pandemic 
influenza assistance in the case of a human pandemic.  Russia has 
not yet adopted a comprehensive avian and pandemic influenza 
preparedness plan.  A draft plan is being reviewed by WHO, but needs 
further refinement (Ref B).  The draft mentions the general need to 
coordinate and collaborate with WHO, but does not discuss who would 
distribute assistance.
