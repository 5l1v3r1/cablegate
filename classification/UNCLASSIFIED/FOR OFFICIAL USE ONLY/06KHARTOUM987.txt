¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The long awaited civil service reform 
in Southern Sudan will be complete within the next few 
weeks, according to the newly appointed Under Secretary 
at the Ministry of Labor, Public Service, and Human 
Resource Development.  Under Secretary Mark Zangabeyo 
told Acting Consul General Juba (A/CG) that his ministry 
is serving as the human resource arm of the Government of 
Southern Sudan (GoSS), and as such has been coordinating 
the effort to review the qualifications of all current 
government employees.  He said that the civil service, 
which now includes workers from both Khartoum's 
Government Coordinating Council (GCC) and the SPLM's 
Civil Authority of New Sudan (CANS), will be thinned 
considerably.  Although this will create some 
unemployment problems, Zangabeyo feels it is necessary 
for the functioning of the government and a vocational 
skills program should help ease the transition.  End 
Summary.

¶2. (SBU) Over the past several months, every ministry has 
been charged with reviewing the qualifications of all its 
employees from both civil services and comparing them to 
the ministry's needs.  Employees are judged based on 
their experience, education, and past performance.  The 
Ministry of Labor has now collected the results and is 
performing a final review.  Zangabeyo says that 
appointments should be announced within the next few 
weeks. 
 
¶3. (U) Currently, the members of the GCC are getting paid 
by the Government of National Unity, while the CANS 
employees are working under an incentive, benefits, and 
per diem system called "consolidated pay."  Once the 
civil service is unified, all workers will be paid by the 
GoSS.

¶4. (SBU) According to Zangabeyo, the Ministry of Labor is 
preparing itself to be the one-stop shop for all GoSS 
human resource needs, from hiring and firing to training 
and labor law drafting.  The ministry will also take the 
lead in creating vocational training opportunities for 
all Southern Sudanese. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The initial focus for vocational training will 
be civil service members not retained, demobilized SPLA 
soldiers, and members of the diaspora returning to the 
South.  Zangabeyo said that demobilized SPLA troops will 
be a particular priority, and that in addition to 
training, there will be a program to give preferential 
hiring to these veterans for all government jobs.
