REF: ABIDJAN 203 
 
 ¶1.  (U)  Summary.  Within the last few weeks, striking 
secondary school teachers (reftel), university professors and 
researchers, and medical technicians and nurses all ended 
their strikes, bringing a measure of labor calm to the 
government-controlled zone (the strikes did not take place in 
the Forces Nouvelles-held zones).  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Secondary schools resumed classes on March 19 
after twenty six school days were lost.  The Ministry of 
Education (controlled by FPI stalwart Michel Amani N'Guessan) 
yielded significant ground, committing to implement 
recommendations made at a 2006 Grand Bassam seminar to 
increase housing allowances and boost the grade of teachers 
with advanced degrees.  More importantly, the Ministry agreed 
to recognize the "illegal" union behind the strike that was 
more than 90 percent effective in the government zone.  In an 
abrupt, politically embarrassing volte face, the Ministry 
agreed to let the Coordination of Secondary School Teachers 
(CES) apply for legal status.  In an attempt to break the 
strike, five CES leaders had been jailed (for declaring a 
strike by an "illegal" group), but the government was later 
forced to released them, bowing to public pressure to end the 
strike as teachers remained firm in their demands. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) University professors and researchers ended their 
two-week old strike on March 14 when President Gbagbo offered 
to "consider" their demands for higher professional grades 
and the reinstatement of doctors and nurses at teaching 
hospitals into the national Civil Service. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On March 12, the nation's paramedical corps ended 
their eleven-day strike after the government issued a decree 
implementing a January accord to boost allowances by 100 
percent.  The government had failed to put into effect the 
January accord, prompting a resumption of the paramedics' 
work stoppage from January. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The end of the work stoppages took place shortly 
after the conclusion of a week-long "Social Forum" in Grand 
Bassam on March 2.  At the closing ceremony, President Gbagbo 
announced some modest changes in labor practices: the end of 
mandatory retirement after 30 years of service, an increase 
in family and transport allowances, consideration of more 
sweeping recommendations put forth by public and private 
commissions related to public salary levels (frozen since 
1997), an overall revision of the public sector professional 
grading system, and increased  protections for private sector 
employees against dismissal and layoffs.  However, the 
President asked participants to sign a "social truce" against 
strikes on April 3, reinforcing not-so veiled threats of 
stronger actions against strikers made by Labor Minister 
Hubert Oulaye (also FPI) during the Forum. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Comment:  The government appears to have bought 
some labor peace, at least in the short term, by acceding to 
much of the unions' agenda.  However, the relative success of 
these strikes may encourage similar actions by other groups, 
at least in the public sector.  We would not be surprised to 
see such labor challenges arise early in the existence of a 
new transitional government, whether it be led by Soro or 
someone else.  End Comment.
