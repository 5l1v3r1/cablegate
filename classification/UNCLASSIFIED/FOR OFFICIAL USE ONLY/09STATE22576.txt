     ¶B. HACKETT-SIMONOFF EMAIL OF 3/9/09 
 
¶1. (U) Department provides the following guidance regarding 
compensation for judges employed by the Special Tribunal for 
Lebanon (STL).  This guidance modifies that previously sent 
in REF A. 
 
¶2. (SBU) USUN may support the British compromise proposal 
which provides for a one-time adjustment of the base salary 
of STL judges to 161,681 USD.  This adjustment should be 
linked to neither the compensation rates of the UN 
professional staff nor the prevailing salaries of Hague-based 
tribunal judges.  It simply embraces the concept that 
reconsideration of salaries should be determined by the 
Management Committee on an annual basis, taking into account 
the decisions of the UNGA regarding compensation of judges in 
other tribunals.  (See REF B)
