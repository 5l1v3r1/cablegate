¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY.  We continued our field assessments 
today.  The hardest hit area seems to be a triangular-shaped 
area (Puerto Cabezas-Sandy Bay-Rosita) where the devastation 
has been extreme.  Sandy Bay and surrounding communities were 
virtually destroyed. Interior towns of Bonanza, Siuna and 
Rosita didn't show the signs of extensive damage that had 
been initially reported.  Similarly, while the town of Waspam 
and most of the communities along the Rio Coco do show signs 
of flooding, there weren't the signs of extreme storm damage 
that had been reported immediately after the Hurricane. 
Today we received additional U.S. military assets in the form 
of a command element from Joint Task Force-Bravo and the USS 
Wasp, carrying six helicopters.  The first USAID/OFDA charter 
flight arrived this evening and tomorrow we will begin our 
distribution activities to affected areas, beginning in Sandy 
Bay and surrounding communities.  The government raised the 
death toll to 24 people.  Public Affairs released a press 
statement indicating the U.S. assistance totals more than USD 
403,000, not including DOD assets that are engaged in the 
relief effort.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CURRENT SITUATION 
----------------- 
 
¶2. (U) AFFECTED PERSONS: Today Nicaragua's Civil Defense 
Authority, the National System for Disaster Prevencion 
Mitigation and Assistance (SINAPRED), raised the number of 
confirmed fatalities from 4 to 24 today.  SINAPRED is now 
also reporting that the total number of people affected is 
35,000; about 13,500 of which were evacuated prior to the 
storm. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) AERIAL OBSERVATIONS: Today, a U.S. military officer 
flew over large portions of the Northern Atlantic Region in a 
C-12 and provided the below observations about various areas 
in the RAAN.  It appears that the greatest damage occurred in 
a westward-pointing, triangle-shaped area between Puerto 
Cabezas and Sandy Bay and along the east-west road towards 
the interior community of Rosita.  Sandy Bay and coastal 
communities were demolished, as were interior towns along the 
Rosita-Puerto Cabezas road.  (NOTE: These observations 
pertain primarily to visible signs of hurricane damage, and 
are not evaluations about economic or agricultural impact of 
the hurricane. END NOTE.) 
 
--SANDY BAY AND ENVIRONS: Sandy Bay, where Felix made landfall, has suffered extreme damage, almost completely destroyed. The same was true for the coastal communities to the north and to south down to Puerto Cabezas. There was widespread coastal flooding and all trees in the area had been knocked down.

--PUERTO CABEZAS AND WAWA: We have previously provided our assessments of damage in Cabezas. From the air, the town of Wawa, south of Cabezas, did not show visible signs of damage.

--PUERTO CABEZAS-ROSITA ROAD: Evidence of the extreme destruction continued along the east-west dirt road between Puerto Cabezas and Rosita. While Rosita itself didn't show dramatic visible signs of damage, all the towns and a large swathe of trees along the road moving east from Rosita to the coast had been leveled. The road itself was in use today by a few buses and trucks; however the bridge across the Wawa River was totally gone and people were using a ferry to cross the swollen river at that point. Although the water level in the Wawa River was very high, it was still within its banks.

--ROSITA-BONANZA-SIUNA: Like Rosita, the towns of Bonanza and Siuna and surrounding areas did not show dramatic, visible signs of storm damage.

--WASPAM AND THE RIO COCO AREA: The town of Waspam and communities along the Rio Coco--from San Carlos, through Waspam, towards Cabo Gracias a Dios on the coast--did not show dramatic signs of storm damage. There was some evidence of flooding, particularly for dwellings nearest the river.

--WASPAM-PUERTO CABEZAS: We have not yet done assessment flights along the north-south road below Waspam down to Santa Maria and Sisin. However, based on observations of the last two days, this area was in the direct path of Felix, and like Sandy Bay is likely to have suffered very severe damage.
 
CONSULAR: DISCUSSIONS WITH EUROPEANS 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) ConGen met with consular representatives from 10 
European embassies to exchange information on expatriate 
casualties and requests for assistance.  All reported similar 
scenarios -- very small or no expatriate communities with 
those living in the affected areas desiring to remain in 
place to assist with relief efforts.  ConGen provided a copy 
of our September 4 warden message which advised Amcits to 
defer non-essential travel to the region because of access 
problems and degraded infrastructure.  The message also 
warned about the potential spread of waterborne diseases, as 
well as life-threatening flash floods and mudslides that 
could occur well-inland many days after the hurricane's 
landfall. 
 
USG PLANNING AND RESPONSE 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Embassy Hurricane Working Group met this afternoon. We participated in one Washington-organized teleconference today. The JTF-Bravo command element arrived in country as well and began standing up a command and control center in Puerto Cabezas. The USAID/OFDA field team convened a meeting with SINAPRED to inform them about our planned distribution activities to the affected areas. The team told SINAPRED officials that we planned to begin distribution of our relief supplies on September 7 at 0700 local time. The initial distribution will be to Sandy Bay and surrounding communities using helicopters from the USS WASP. The first of two USAID/OFDA commercial charter flights carrying relief supplies arrived in Puerto Cabezas late today (at 1800 local). The second is scheduled to arrive on Friday afternoon. The total value of USG assistance (cash and supplies) to date is roughly USD 403,000 not including the value of U.S. military assets involved in the effort. Based on revised needs assessments, USAID/OFDA has requested an additional 800 rolls of plastic for temporary shelter (bringing the total to 1000 rolls.)
 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY OUTREACH 
------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) During a public event this morning, the Ambassador 
responded to media questions about U.S. assistance by 
pointing out our response has been "rapid and massive."  Our 
press release today included his comments as well as 
catalogued the volume of assistance we have provided so far, 
including more than $400,000 worth of cash and supplies and 
the arrival of an additional JTF-B helicopter, DAO Honduras 
C-12, and the USS Wasp with its six helicopters.  We will be 
sending a press officer out to Puerto Cabezas to prepare for 
the Ambassador's projected trip there this weekend and to 
help manage the growing presence of local, U.S. and 
international media representatives in Puerto Cabezas seeking 
to cover the story.  Coverage in local Nicaraguan media has 
been generally positive, including video of President Ortega 
speaking with Embassy military personnel in Puerto Cabezas 
upon his arrival there yesterday. 
 
OTHER FOREIGN ASSISTANCE 
------------------------ 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Since the disaster began, we have had regular 
discussions with diplomatic and international organization 
colleagues regarding relief assistance.  SINAPRED has now 
taken control of the daily afternoon meeting between UN, EU 
and other (mostly European) diplomats to coordinate relief 
assistance.  The UN has announced a flash appeal for $1.3 
million USD to cover urgent needs.  Aside from a Honduran 
C-130 on Wednesday, there has been very little assistance 
flowing into the country.  This afternoon President Ortega 
did greet a Venezuelan aircraft in Managua, which appeared to 
off-load a few boxes of relief supplies and a vehicle, 
perhaps an ambulance.  A few Caribbean nations have also send 
supplies.  It seems that most other potential donors that 
have been able to marshall donations, haven't yet been able 
to get those donations flowing.
