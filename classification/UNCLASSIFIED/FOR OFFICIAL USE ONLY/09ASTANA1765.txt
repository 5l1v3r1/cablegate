¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador delivered reftel demarch on October 
2 to Chairman of the Security Council of the Government of 
Kazakhstan Marat Tazhin. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Tazhin replied that Kazakhstan's position is 
well-known and has not changed.  President Nazarbayev remains 
steadfastly committed to nuclear non-proliferation and takes 
every opportunity, both in public and in private, to make 
such points, including with the leadership of Iran.  Tazhin 
said that he himself had had a 40-minute conversation with 
Iran's Foreign Minister Motakki when President Ahmedinejad 
visited Astana in May.  He had urged Iran to be transparent 
about its nuclear activities and to cooperate fully with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency.  However, Tazhin said, he 
got nowhere with Motakki.  Tazhin added, "It reminds me of 
what Winston Churchhill said about the Balkans, that they 
were the 'new child of Europe.'  Sometimes certain countries 
are like difficult teenagers."  Tazhin praised President 
Obama's efforts to work closely with Russia and China on this 
issue.
