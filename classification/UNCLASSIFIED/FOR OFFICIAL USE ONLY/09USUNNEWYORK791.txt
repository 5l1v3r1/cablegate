SUBJECT: RWANDA'S UN PERMREP ASKS FOR HELP IN ARRESTING 
EXPATRIATE FDLR LEADERS; VOWS TO SUPPORT U.S. DURING UNGA 
 
¶1. (SBU) In an introductory meeting with Ambassador Rice on 
August 13, new Rwandan PermRep Gasana asked for assistance in 
holding accountable FDLR rebel leaders who continue to 
support the FDLR from Europe and North America.  Ambassador 
Rice stressed the need for Rwanda to supply solid evidence so 
that U.S. authorities could sanction or take other 
appropriate action against FDLR leaders or supporters in the 
U.S. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Rice congratulated Rwanda on the 
appointment of General Nyambumba as Force Commander for the 
African Union-UN Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), the first 
Rwandan appointed as a UN force commander.  Gasana reiterated 
Rwanda's commitment to international peacekeeping and also 
requested U.S. assistance to ensure UNAMID was fully 
equipped.  He stressed the need for the international 
community to supply authorized military helicopters for 
UNAMID. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ambassador Gasana said the meeting between DRC 
President Kabila and Rwandan President Kagame on August 6 
went well.  He was encouraged by the increased rapprochement 
between the DRC and Rwanda, as evidenced by a joint methane 
gas retrieval project the two countries are undertaking to 
exploit the methane deposits of Lake Kivu. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Ambassador Rice and Ambassador Gasana agreed that an 
UNGA resolution on the Right to Protect (R2P) could be 
counter-productive at this time (Rwanda is currently co-chair 
of the "Friends of R2P").  Gasana said Rwanda preferred to 
have the records of the International Criminal Tribunal for 
Rwanda archived domestically, and not in The Hague.  In 
response to Ambassador Rice's request for greater bilateral 
cooperation on UNGA issues, Gasana vowed to support the U.S. 
"in any way possible."
