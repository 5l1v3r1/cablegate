to officials in the MFA's Global Affairs Bureau on March 15. 
The Finnish officials said that while they shared U.S. 
concerns about Cuba's human rights abuses, no decisions had 
been made at the MFA as regards the Cuba resolution at the 
UNCHR.  Moreover, the Finnish official specifically 
responsible for the Cuba resolution was in Geneva and 
unavailable for comment. The MFA officials said that Finland 
would support whatever common or consensus position emerged 
during EU deliberations on the issue;  they believed that 
Finland was unlikely to play a leading role in such 
deliberations, however.  One official opined that she 
believed Spain would play the lead role in crafting the EU's 
strategy as regards the resolution.
