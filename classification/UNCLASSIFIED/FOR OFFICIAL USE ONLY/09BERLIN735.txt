SUBJECT: GERMANY H1N1 FLU UPDATE: 229 CONFIRMED CASES 
 
REF:  A) Berlin 720, B) Berlin 714 and previous. 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY: The number of H1N1 cases in Germany rose to 
229 on June 18, as thirty-four further infections were 
confirmed.  First case of H1N1 confirmed in Bremen.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The National Reference Center for Influenza at the 
Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in its press 
briefings yesterday and today a total of 34 new laboratory- 
confirmed cases of H1N1 for Germany.  This increases the total 
number of confirmed cases in Germany to 229 (Refs A, B and 
previous). 
 
¶3. (SBU)  On June 17, RKI announced eight new laboratory- 
confirmed cases of H1N1 in Germany, increasing the number of 
confirmed cases in Germany to 203.  The new cases were 
distributed among the federal states as follows: North Rhine- 
Westphalia (4), Baden-Wuerttemberg (3), and Bavaria (1). 
 
¶4. (SBU)  On June 18, RKI confirmed twenty-six more people to 
be infected with the new flu.  This increased the total number 
of confirmed cases in Germany to 229.  The new cases were 
distributed among the federal states as follows: Bavaria (8), 
Lower Saxony (7), Baden-Wuerttemberg (5), North Rhine- 
Westphalia (3), Rhineland-Palatinate (1), Schleswig-Holstein 
(1), and Bremen (1). 
 
 
Bremen reports first case of H1N1 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  RKI confirmed the first case of the new flu in the 
federal state of Bremen.  Media reports indicate the case 
involved a 42-year old woman reportedly returned from a trip 
to Florida.  To date, the federal state of Saarland is the 
only German state free of the virus. 
 
 
North Rhine-Westphalia shows highest number of infections 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  North Rhine-Westphalia shows the highest number of 
infections among all German states with 104 confirmed cases, 
followed by Bavaria (37 cases) and Baden-Wuerttemberg (26 
cases).  Media reports indicate that North Rhine-Westphalia's 
State Health Minister Karl-Josef Laumann wants to buy enough 
vaccine for all of its 18 million residents. The purchase of 
enough vaccine would reportedly cost the state 500 million 
euros. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  The number of cases resulting from human-human 
transmission of the virus inside Germany now sits at 115.  A 
number of the previously reported cases of domestic infection 
(REF A) were found to have occurred elsewhere, altering the 
count. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The RKI has reported that, consistent with Germany's 
National Influenza Pandemic Plan, all federal states are 
maintaining enough antiviral drugs to treat 20% of their 
populations. They deem this sufficient preparation to deal 
with a pandemic of medium intensity.
