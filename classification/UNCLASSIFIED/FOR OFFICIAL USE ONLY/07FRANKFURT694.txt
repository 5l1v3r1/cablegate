¶1. (U) SUMMARY: State authorities deported two Islamic extremists 
from Baden-Wuerttemberg (B-W) in late January according to reports 
from the state interior ministry.  B-W Interior Minister Rech cites 
the deportations as evidence of his state's strong anti-extremism 
efforts.  The deportees hail from Algeria and Mauritania.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On February 1, B-W Interior Minister Heribert Rech announced 
the deportation of two Muslim extremists on January 24 and January 
¶26.  Pointing to the deportations as examples of the state's tough 
stance against Islamic extremism, Rech stated "whoever threatens our 
security has no place here and must leave Germany as soon as 
possible."  Rech also said that extremists are "enemies of our 
society and democracy" and that he would use all legal means to 
fight them.  Rech reported that since June 2004 the state has 
deported six Muslim extremists and another six have left 
voluntarily. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The B-W interior ministry reports that one of the deportes 
is an Algerian who had been under investigatin for supporting a 
terrorist organization and fo possible participation in the 
attempted attack t a Christmas market in Strasbourg, France in 
¶2000.  Although the federal prosecutor's investigation of the 
matter ended in 2005, the interior minisry concluded that the 
Algerian's continued residncy in Germany presented significant 
security cocerns, hence the January deportation.  The B-W interior 
ministry also said that earlier attempts to eport the Algerian were 
unsuccessful due to a lak of appropriate travel documents and 
because hethen "disappeared" following the conclusion of the 
investigation in 2005.  An "intensive" law enforcement operation led 
to the Algerian's recent captre in Mannheim; after which he was 
held in custoy until the January deportation.  B-W interior 
mnistry contacts were unwilling to release the name but confirmed 
to a consulate representative that the Algerian was associated with 
the group involed in the attempted Strasbourg attack and had 
orginally been released due to lack of evidence. 
 
. (U) The other deportee is a Mauritanian nationalwho was 
reportedly an Imam and Koran instructor at the now-banned 
"Multi-Culutural House" in Neu-Um (Bavaria).  In December 2006, 
Tuebingen (B-W) fficials ordered his deportation.  Facing this 
oder and pressure from the authorities, he departedGermany of his 
own volition on January 26.
