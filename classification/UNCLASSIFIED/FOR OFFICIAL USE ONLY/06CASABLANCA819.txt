SUBJECT: RESPONSE: EFFECTIVENESS OF UN EFFORTS TO COMBAT SEXUAL 
EXPLOITATION AND ABUSE IN UN PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS 
 
REF: STATE 112531 
 
¶1.  (U) This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (U) This cable is a response to a request for information on 
MINURSO's efforts to combat trafficking in persons (TIP) and sexual 
exploitation and abuse (SEA) involving UN peacekeeping mission 
personnel in the Western Sahara. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to the government of Morocco, TIP and SEA are 
not a problem with the MINURSO mission in the Western Sahara.  In 
discussions with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA), poloff was informed that MINURSO personnel have cooperated 
fully with the GOM in efforts to deal with trafficked persons found 
in the Western Sahara.  GOM has no complains about the MINURSO 
peacekeepers being involved in TIP or SAE.  Representatives from 
both the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Morocco 
and the Moroccan NGO Friends and Family of the Victims of Illegal 
Migration concur with GOM's position.  We are unable to locate any 
reports in the media regarding sexual exploitation or abuse 
involving MINURSO personnel.  We believe that the general public 
perceives no problem of this nature with MINURSO. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  During talks with MINURSO Force Commander Maj. General 
Kurt Mosgaard, Civil Affairs Officer, Clair Bamber, and former Head 
of Operations for Confidence Building Measures, Laith Khalaf, poloff 
was impressed with the level of commitment to fighting TIP and SEA 
problems.  The leadership is not only concerned with prevention of 
abuses within the organization it is going out of its way to assist 
victims it finds in the desert who have been trafficked or abused by 
others.
