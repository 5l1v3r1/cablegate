¶1. (U) This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary:  The Government of Haiti values its 
relationship with Cuba because of the significant amount of 
technical assistance it receives from that country.  The bulk 
of that assistance comes in the form of educational and 
professional exchanges and technical assistance.  We see no 
evidence that Cuba provides appreciable direct financial 
inflows into Haiti, whether by investment in the Haitian 
economy or through budget commitments. End Summary. 
 
Trade/Investment 
---------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Post is aware of no Haitian public or private 
investment in Cuba. Post is aware of no bilateral trade 
agreements between Haiti and Cuba. 
 
Exchanges:  Scholarships for Haitian students 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) As many as eight hundred Haitian medical students have 
been provided scholarships to study in Cuba.  This program 
began under the Jean-Bertrand Aristide's second 
administration (2001-2004) and continues today.  At the 
conclusion of their studies, the Haitian doctors return to 
Haiti to practice in public hospitals and clinics. 
 
Exchanges:  Health and Energy 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) There are approximately 500 Cuban medical doctors 
and technicians practicing in Haitian public hospitals and 
clinics.  Cuban doctors manage two eye, nose and throat 
hospitals in Port-au-Prince and rotate in replacements every 
two to three years.  The program began during Aristide's 
second administration.  The physicians departed quickly when 
Aristide left the country but returned under the Interim 
Government that followed Aristide.  Their presence continues 
under the Preval administration.  (Note:  Cuban doctors 
appear to be well-regarded in the country. End Note.) Reports 
indicate that several hundred Haitians have been provided eye 
surgery in Cuba free of charge under the joint 
Cuba-Venezuelan program ''Operation Miracle.''  President 
Preval frequently travels to Cuba for medical reasons, 
although he has begun traveling to the U.S. as well for such 
purposes, including dental care.  Chamber of Deputies 
President Eric Jean-Jacques as of December 5 was in Cuba for 
medical treatment. 
 
¶6. (SBU) In addition to health sector ties, an indeterminate 
number of Cubans are in Haiti distributing energy-efficient 
light bulbs in poor areas.  Technicians also perform 
maintenance at generating plants of the national electricity 
utility. 
 
Zero GOH Support for Cuban Democracy 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Government of Haiti refrains from publicly 
criticizing any government that gives it substantial 
assistance.  We have never witnessed any GOH criticism -- 
whether by the executive or the legislature -- of Cuba's 
human rights and democracy record.  This position is not 
motivated by ideological affinity to Cuba's social/political 
system, but by the friendship Haiti cultivates with any and 
all providers of substantial assistance.  The Government of 
Haiti, for example, never criticizes Taiwan -- which provides 
substantial assistance to Haiti -- despite the strategic 
significance of China for Haiti.  Additionally, thee are 
close historical ties between Cubans and Haitians. 
 
No Recent High-Level Visits 
--------------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) There have been no high-level diplomatic visits 
between Haiti and Cuba in the last six months.
