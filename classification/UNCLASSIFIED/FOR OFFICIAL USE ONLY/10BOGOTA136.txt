SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Government of Colombia (GOC) sent an Air Force B-727 
to Haiti to participate in humanitarian relief operations on the 
morning of January 14.  The flight carried 7 doctors, 20 search and 
rescue officials, and emergency food and medical supplies. 
Colombian officials said the flight was unable to land due to air 
congestion in Port-au-Prince and may have been diverted to the 
Dominican Republic.  The GOC plans to send additional personnel and 
supplies by C-130 once it assesses the most urgent needs.  VMOD 
Eastman told the Ambassador the GOC would make Colombian military 
bases available to the U.S. and third countries to support relief 
efforts in Haiti--such an effort would highlight the humanitarian 
importance of the U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement. 
 
¶2. (U) Although Colombia does not have an Embassy in Haiti, the 
Colombian Ambassador to the Dominican Republic is dual accredited 
to Haiti.  An estimated 400 Colombian citizens live in Haiti, and 
Colombian aircraft plan to evacuate those Colombian citizens who 
wish to depart.  Colombia has 26 police officers in Haiti as part 
of MINUSTAH, all of whom have been accounted for.  Colombian 
President Alvaro Uribe expressed solidarity with the people of 
Haiti and announced his intention to personally visit Haiti on 
January 17 if circumstances permit.  End Summary. 
 
COLOMBIAN ASSISTANCE 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Colombia sent an Air Force B-727 to Haiti on January 14 to 
participate in humanitarian operations.  The flight departed from 
Colombian Air Force Air Transport Command (CATAM) in Bogota at 
approximately 8:00am EST.  The personnel on board included 20 
search and rescue experts (including trained dogs and handlers) and 
seven doctors specialized in treating trauma patients.  The cargo 
included medical supplies, a mobile field hospital donated by the 
Colombian Army, emergency food and water supplies and several 
satellite telephones.  (Note:  As of 3:00pm EST on January 14, the 
aircraft had not landed due to flight congestion and may have been 
diverted to the Dominican Republic. End note). 
 
¶4. (SBU) Colombian Minister of Interior and Justice Fabio Valencia 
Cossio, Vice Minister of Defense Alejandro Arbelaez and General 
Tito Pinilla traveled to Haiti separately on a Citation-550 
aircraft and reportedly reached Port-au-Prince at around 1:30pm EST 
on January 14.  The GOC officials will assess the situation and 
advise what supplies are needed most urgently.  The GOC plans to 
send a C-130 aircraft with several pallets of relief supplies as 
soon as possible, but the Air Force is holding the flight due to 
reports of air congestion in Port-au-Prince.  The Defense Ministry 
announced it is also prepared to send relief supplies by ship from 
the port of Cartagena, including heavy equipment for 
reconstruction. 
 
GOC OFFERS BASES FOR REGIONAL EFFORTS 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Colombian Defense Ministry offered the use of several 
Colombian airports and military installations to third countries 
participating in the relief efforts in Haiti.  Vice Minister of 
Defense Jorge Mario Eastman told the Ambassador on January 14 that 
Colombian bases such as Palanquero or Malambo (Barranquilla) (which 
are listed under the U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement 
(DCA)) could be utilized by the U.S. military or third countries to 
support aid to Haiti.  The facilities could be used for transit, 
re-fueling and supply of aircraft and crews who are participating 
in aid operations. 
 
COLOMBIAN PRESENCE IN HAITI 
-------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Colombia does not have an Embassy in Haiti, although the 
Colombian Ambassador to the Dominican Republic - retired General 
Mario Montoya - is also accredited to Haiti.  Foreign Ministry 
officials told us that Colombian consular officials from the 
Dominican Republic were traveling to Haiti to assist the estimated 
400 Colombian citizens believed to live in Haiti.  Foreign Ministry 
officials said that Colombian aircraft will bring back any 
Colombian citizens who wish to return to Colombia.  They indicated 
that they had not received any reports of any missing or injured 
Colombian citizens.  (Note:  Colombian Senator Piedad Cordoba 
reported that her sister Marta Lia, who works for the United 
Nations in Haiti, survived the earthquake and is in good 
condition.) 
 
 
 
¶7. (U) Colombia currently has 26 police officers in Haiti as part 
of MINUSTAH, led by Colombian Lieutenant Colonel Santiago Camelo. 
According to the Defense Ministry, all of these personnel have been 
accounted for. 
 
GOC COORDINATION 
---------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) The Colombian Ministry of Interior and Justice formed a 
control center to coordinate the GOC's aid efforts in Haiti.  The 
GOC reportedly plans to set up a coordination center at the 
Port-au-Prince airport.  The Colombian Government plans to channel 
its aid to Haiti through the United Nations. 
 
URIBE SENDS SOLIDARITY MESSAGE 
----------------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) The GOC announced support for Haiti on January 12. 
President Alvaro Uribe sent a message of solidarity to the people 
of Haiti on January 14 and pledged Colombia's support to the relief 
efforts.  Uribe also announced his intention to personally visit 
Haiti on January 17 if circumstances permit. 
 
¶10. (U) Minimize considered.
