SUBJECT: BAHRAIN: SHIA ULAMA COUNCIL ELECTIONS 
 
REF: 08 MANAMA 536 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: A governing body for Bahrain's mainstream 
Shia clergy selected new leadership but we expect continuity 
in the senior clergy's politics.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Ulama Council held its regularly scheduled 
election for the seven-member Central Committee on November 
¶21.  Former Chairman Sheikh Isa Qassem (the most popular Shia 
cleric on the island) and Deputy Chairman Sayed Abdulla Al 
Ghoraifi did not run for re-election, despite requests from 
other Ulama Council members for them to do so.  Qassem and Al 
Ghoraifi will remain advisors to, and supporters of, the 
council. 
 
¶3. (U) The new Central Committee members are: 
- Sheikh Majeed Al Mishal 
- Sayed Mohsin Al Ghoraifi 
- Sayed Haider Al Sitri 
- Sheikh Ali Rahma 
- Sheikh Ahmed Amralla 
- Sheikh Isa Al Mo'min 
- Sheikh Fadhel Al Zaki 
 
Al Mishal was elected Chairman, Al Ghoraifi Deputy Chairman, 
and Al Mo'min and Al Zaki treasurers.  Sayed Haider Al Sitri 
is also a Wifaq member of parliament. 
 
¶4. (U) The new leadership is somewhat younger than its 
predecessors.  Local observers have suggested that while this 
might indicate a change in the council's strategies, they 
continue to pursue the same policy goals, including 
opposition to a secular statute on family law, and support 
for Wifaq's campaigns against sectarian discrimination and 
the naturalization of foreign Sunnis.  Mishal and Ghoraifi 
met with the former leadership on January 3 to discuss their 
plans for the council and its future activities. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Even though Qassem is no longer the council 
chairman, he retains enormous personal prestige.  Critics of 
Qassem's chairmanship of the council hope that his departure 
will nudge the council toward a more quietist focus on 
religion rather than politics, but there will be no 
diminution of Qassem's influence in the Shia community.
