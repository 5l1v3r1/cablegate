¶1. (SBU) International Foundation for Electoral Systems 
(IFES) Country Director Jeffrey Carlson told us September 15 
there is a good chance that IFES will lead a trip with four 
members of Egypt's Supreme Electoral Commission (SEC) in 
October to India, where SEC members would meet with Indian 
counterparts on a program similar to the SEC's visit to 
Poland in June (reftel).  (Comment:  The SEC's decision to 
participate in this subsequent trip is a further breakthrough 
for IFES in its effort to engage with this key electoral 
body, and is testament to IFES' low-key, confidence-building 
approach through Egyptian partners.  End comment.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Carlson also said that IFES is exploring the 
provision of a specialized electoral training module to the 
Interior Ministry in October, and plans to work with Cairo 
University on developing technical assistance programs for 
upcoming elections.  Carlson told us that IFES intends to 
pursue voter education training among syndicates and unions, 
and through its website "Aswatna," ("Our Votes") which is not 
formally identified as an IFES website.
