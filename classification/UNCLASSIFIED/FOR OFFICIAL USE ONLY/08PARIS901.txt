SUBJECT: INITIAL FRENCH RESPONSE ON ATTENDANCE AT STOCKHOLM 
MINISTERIAL FOR IRAQ COMPACT 
 
REF: STATE 437999 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  French MFA Iraq desk officer Olivier Masseret told 
us late May 7 that the GOF had not yet decided who would lead 
its delegation to the ICI ministerial in Stockholm at the end 
of May.  As he has previously indicated, Masseret said that 
FM Kouchner would like to attend, but Kouchner's schedulers 
have not yet determined whether this would be feasible. 
(Comment:  Despite French reluctance to host the ICI 
ministerial and be an active participant, because of France's 
belief that the top priorities in Iraq are stabilizing the 
security situation and promoting national reconciliation, 
Paris remains extremely interested in the Compact and how it 
can help international efforts on behalf of Iraq's 
reconstruction.  End comment) 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Masseret said he would pass reftel points to other 
concerned offices in the MFA and throughout the GOF.  He 
agreed to pass along any detailed responses he receives next 
week, i.e., after the current vacation period that has 
decimated most GOF offices.  Embassy will pursue this 
demarche with other ministries and offices in the meantime 
and report any significant responses septel.
