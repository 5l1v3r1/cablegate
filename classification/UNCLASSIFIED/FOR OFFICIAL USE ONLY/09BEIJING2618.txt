(MFA) September 10. 
 
¶2. (SBU) MOHRSS provided the following response: 
Quote. We request USDOL to delete China from the US Department of 
Labor's List of Goods Produced with Child Labor or Forced Labor. We 
are concerned, because the List is developed in a way that certainly 
does not reflect the true situation in the China, and publicizing 
such list is not conducive to the friendly relationship between our 
two departments.  We are ready to make joint efforts to further 
develop the ties between the MOHRSS and USDOL. End Quote.
