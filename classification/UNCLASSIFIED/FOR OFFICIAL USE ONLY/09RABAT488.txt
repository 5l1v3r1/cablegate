SUBJECT: MOROCCAN PERSPECTIVES ON WHALING COMMISSION 
 
REF: STATE 57029 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on June 8 to 
Abdelouahed Benabbou, Director of Cooperation and Legal 
Affairs and Morocco's Commissioner at the International 
Whaling Commission (IWC), and Mohamed Yassine El Aroussi, 
head of Bilateral Cooperation, at the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Fisheries.  Benabbou stated that Morocco will maintain, 
at the upcoming IWC meeting, a moderate position that 
recognizes the importance of "culture, history, and 
subsistence needs in sustainable exploitation" of whales, yet 
also recognizes the need to protect whale populations. 
Though Morocco has no direct interest in whaling, Benabbou 
emphasized, IWC membership is part of its responsibilities as 
a maritime country. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Responding to reftel questions on Morocco's views 
of IWC issues, Benabbou suggested that IWC meetings would be 
more effective if parties avoided "extreme positions" and 
agreed to "adhere to current IWC statutes" instead of 
proposing fundamental changes, such as efforts to ban all 
exploitation of whales.  Such agreement on maintaining the 
current statutes and principles will head off efforts to 
replace the IWC with a new organization.  Benabbou assessed 
that dialogue often breaks down when Japan feels that other 
parties are trying to dictate to it or lecture it, and 
suggested that parties seek to maintain respect for opposing 
positions. 
 
 ¶3.  (SBU) Benabbou concurred that the Small Working Group 
(SWG) should continue its work for an additional year.  He 
observed that the SWG would be most efficient if the number 
of participants is maintained at the minimum number required 
to include all of the points of view within the IWC.  That 
said, he continued, any country that strongly seeks to 
participate should not be excluded.  Benabbou assented to the 
participation as observers of non-governmental and other 
organizations in the work of the SWG and the IWC in general, 
to maximize transparency. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Benabbou praised the work of current IWC Chair Bill 
Hogarth, as well as the positive attitudes of the Japanese 
Vice-Chairs.  "It will be hard to replace" the current chair, 
he said.  Although Benabbou offered no suggestions for a new 
Chair or Vice-Chair, he emphasized the need for consensus 
candidates. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Benabbou confirmed that Morocco had submitted that 
morning a formal proposal to the IWC Secretariat to host the 
2010 meetings of the IWC in Morocco, perhaps in Agadir.  Any 
financial support from the U.S. or other parties would be 
welcome, he noted.
