¶1. (U) On August 11, UNMIS police started training the first of the 
Abyei Joint Integrated Police Units (JIPU) officers under a Rapid 
Deployment Package (RDP) approved by GONU Police General Al-A'del 
Ajab Yagob and GOSS South Sudan Police Service Inspector General of 
Police Lt. General Makuei Deng Majuc (ref B). The UN said they plan 
to conduct a ten-day basic training module, held in Abyei town, to 
be followed by a 45-day crises response training segment. 
 
¶2. (U) UNMIS police, with the assistance of UNDP, developed the 
ten-project 1.8 million USD RDP immediately after the Abyei Roadmap 
Agreement was signed on June 8.  As of August 11, the UK has 
committed to funding the first five projects, including basic police 
orientation for the Abyei JIPU; post conflict trauma sensitivity; 
conflict resolution methods; office equipment; uniforms and personal 
equipment for 600 JIPU officers at a cost of USD 526,000. Germany 
has committed to funding USD 122,000 worth of basic communications 
equipment. Donors have not agreed to fund 1.2 million USD to support 
JIPU transportation needs, a women's and children's aid post, 
temporary accommodation for 600 JIPU personnel, or training and 
equipment to support a 120-troop crisis response unit. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On August 4, UNMIS Police Commissioner Kai Vittrup told 
potential donor nation poloffs and development officers that the 
idea of a joint police unit is new to UN peacekeeping and to the 
CPA.  He said that a number of practical issues have yet to be 
worked out, but that JIU commander Brigadier Valentino Tokmac and 
JIPU Commander Col. Luka Deng Kual have agreed not to arm the JIPU 
officers.  (Comment: UNMIS DPKO operations staff told us that they 
want to avoid the significant potential "blue-on-blue" risk posed by 
police carrying weapons in close proximity to JIU forces.  It is not 
clear to us how realistic this approach will be in the long run in a 
region like Abyei, which needs law and order. End comment.)  Asked 
whether gun-toting civilians would represent a problem for the 
unarmed police, Vittrup said that for the long-term he plans to work 
with UN IDDR to develop a disarmament program.  In the short term he 
will propose a firearms ban in Abyei city, along with combined JIU 
and JIPU patrols.  Vittrup said the issue of ID cards also appears 
to be resolved with the GNU agreeing to issue ID cards to the JIPU 
(ref A). 
 
¶4. (SBU) Obstacles remain, Vittrup said, including the high level of 
mistrust between northern and southern police officers and a wide 
disparity in materiel resources from each side.  "The southern 
police officers have nothing; no communication gear and no 
vehicles."  UN Abyei Head of Office Chris Johnson expressed concern 
to poloff about the long-term challenge of maintaining a civilian 
police force, noting that meeting transportation and communication 
requirements is vital if the police are to patrol all of Abyei's 
surrounding areas where Dinka-Misseriya ethnic clashes are most 
likely to flare up.  She said that with Abyei's infrastructure 
largely destroyed, maintaining a police force will require 
significant support from the UN. This echoes remarks from UNMIS 
Senior Operations Officer Major Mark Hainsworth who said that the 
"life support" for the military JIUs is already problematic with 
many JIUs already complaining about short rations. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Continued progress on implementation of the Abyei 
roadmap is a good thing, but the lack of resources will become a 
significant problem over time and will affect morale and unity in 
both JIU and JIPU ranks.  The international community and especially 
the UN need to move quickly and aggressively to address these gaps 
and not let them fester, as has been the case previously at the JDB 
regarding JIU support.  Embassy will be reaching out to both the GNU 
and GOSS Interior Ministries to, at the very least, encourage full 
funding and support for the JIPU in Abyei. An effective JIPU and JIU 
are absolutely essential in preventing new pressures from building 
up in this unstable region. A report on international support to the 
JIU in Abyei will be transmitted septel.
