¶1.  (U) On Friday April 17, journalist Andrisson Shadreck 
Manyere, Tsvangirai advisor Gandhi Mudzingwa, and Chris 
(Kisimu) Dhlamini were released on US$1,000 bail.  The three 
men were abducted between October and December 2008 and are 
charged, along with four others, of bombing several Zimbabwe 
police stations in 2008.  On April 9, High Court Justice 
Charles Hungwe granted the men bail, but the State blocked 
their release by notifying the Judge they intended to appeal. 
 Since the State failed to file the actual appeal within 
seven days, the men were released on bail on April 17. 
 
¶2. (U) Approximately 29 others were reported abducted between 
October and December; seven are believed to still be missing 
(reftels).  No one is sure where they are -- they may be 
dead, in State custody, or in hiding in South Africa or 
elsewhere.  All political detainees whose whereabouts were 
known have now been released. 
 
¶3. (U) Trial dates have been set for some the other 
abductees, who are divided into three trials: 
 
-- June 8: Some of those accused of recruiting insurgents: 
Fidelis Chiramba, Concilia Chinanzvavana, Emmanuel 
Chinanzvavana, Pieta Kaseke, Violet Mupfuranhehwe, and Collen 
Mutemagau 
 
-- June 29: The "bombers": Chris Dhlamini, Gandhi Mudzingwa, 
Andrisson Manyere, Zachariah Nkomo, Regis Mujeyi, and Mapfumo 
Garutsa 
 
-- July 20: The remaining recruiters: Jestina Mukoko, 
Broderick Takawira, and Audrey Zimbudzana 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT: While new incidents of politically 
motivated arrests and abductions have declined sharply, these 
ongoing cases demonstrate that the office of Attorney General 
Johannes Tomana is not turning a new page.  The ongoing 
mystery of the whereabouts of the other seven MDC activists 
reported abducted over four months ago has steadily fallen 
from public view.  We are grateful that all of the abductees 
confirmed in State custody have finally been released -- even 
if it comes as a result of a technicality -- but remain 
concerned that they continue to face these serious, trumped 
up charges that Tomana shows no sign of dropping.  END 
COMMENT.
