SUBJECT: IRAN PRESS/NUCLEAR: TEHRAN FRIDAY PRAYER SPEECHES FOCUS ON 
NUCLEAR ISSUE, RELATIONS WITH US 
 
DUBAI 00000482  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
(SBU) For the November 6 Friday Prayers in Tehran, both the 
'warm-up' Speaker, Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy 
Commission Chairman Ala'addin Borujerdi, and the main speaker, 
Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami [NOTE: no relation to former President 
Khatami] discussed the nuclear issue and relations with the US. 
Both speeches contained the usual rhetoric about Iran's 
inviolable rights for nuclear energy and Iran's steadfastness in 
protecting those rights, with the following points made in 
addition: 
 
 
 
MAJLIS NAT'L SECURITY HEAD BORUJERDI: 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 
 
- Iran will base its decisions of fuel for the Tehran Research 
Reactor (TRR) based on Iran's national interests. 
 
 
 
- The policy of confrontation pursued by the US and its allies 
has changed to one of interaction due to the steadfastness of 
Iran. 
 
 
 
- the suggestion for Iran to send its own enriched uranium for 
greater enrichment abroad indicates that the US and its allies 
has had to put aside its policy of confrontation and have 
adopted a policy of interaction. 
 
 
 
- The Supreme National Security Council is currently deciding 
[about the TRR deal] based on Iran's national interests.  The 
SNSC and President Ahmadinejad, as its head, are pursuing our 
national interests with seriousness and will make the necessary 
decisions. 
 
 
 
- America's strategic policy towards Iran hasn't changed at all: 
the Bush era he threatened us and now Obama smiles at us.  The 
US Congress is controlled by Democrats and Obama but it has 
approved a 55 million dollar budget for toppling the Islamic 
government [of Iran]. 
 
 
 
AYATOLLAH AHMAD KHATAMI 
 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
 
- If the West wants to play games, Iran will produce its own 
fuel for the TRR/ 
 
 
 
- Supreme Leader Khamenei has done the most for protecting the 
Iranian nation's interests, and with such a cautious and wise 
Supreme Leader we can be assured that all of Iran's rights, to 
include nuclear rights, will remain safe. 
 
 
 
- 'They' always say that Iran must do confidence building 
measures, whereas it is us who have no confidence in them [i.e. 
the West]. 
 
 
 
- Western countries have plundered Iran and abused its rights - 
it has been 30 years that Iran has owned 10 percent of Eurodif 
but hasn't received its related rights, so what guarantee is 
there that if Iran gives its 3.5 percent enriched uranium it 
will receive 20 percent enriched uranium in return: "who are you 
trying to fool, the Iranian nation is aware and won't be fooled 
by your tricks." 
 
 
 
DUBAI 00000482  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
 
- According to the law, the IAEA must give nuclear fuel to Iran. 
 
 
 
-  Iran's unwillingness to reach an accommodation with the US 
isn't due to extremism or stubbornness or emotions, but based on 
its wise positions.  From 1953 for more than 56 years all Iran 
has seen from the US is treachery and crimes. 
 
 
 
-[referring to Obama's November 4 statement]: He lies in saying 
that the US won't interfere in Iran's internal events, and such 
a big lie, it is clear the US interfered in the events after the 
last election and that US media sought to incite. 
 
 
 
- [Referring to the Congress approving a bill last week which 
allocated more than 50 million dollars for soft war and causing 
trouble in Iran] As long as America's arrogant spirit exists, 
they must know that Iran will never succumb to 'devilish 
negotiations.'
