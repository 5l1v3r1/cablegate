SUBJECT: POST ASKS ROYG TO NOT DEPORT DETAINED BAHA'IS 
 
REF: SANAA 1422 
 
¶1. (SBU) During an August 26 telephone conversation, Post's 
Legatt office advised the General Prosecutor for the 
Specialized Courts, Said al-Aqel, against the deportation of 
the four remaining imprisoned Baha'is.  The Legatt office 
asserted that if deported, the Baha'is, most specifically the 
Iranians, will likely face persecution in their home 
countries.  Al-Aqel provided no substantive response but 
agreed to meet in person to discuss the matter. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During an August 27 telephone conversation with the 
Director General of the Interior Minister's Office, Ahmed 
al-Sunaidar, the Charge d'Affaires (CDA) said that the USG 
was pleased with the release of the two Yemeni Baha'is.  The 
CDA added, however, that we remained worried about the 
possible deportation of the four still imprisoned Baha'is. 
The CDA asked that the ROYG not make a rash decision 
regarding the deportation, emphasizing that the Baha'is will 
face religious persecution as soon as they arrive in Iran. 
Al-Sunaidar replied that he will take the message back to the 
Minister of Interior, providing no additional comment.  Post 
will continue to report on any updates.
