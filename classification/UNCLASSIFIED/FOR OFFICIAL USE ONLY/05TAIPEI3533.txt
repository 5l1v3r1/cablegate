SUBJECT: Fake Viagra from China Seized in Southern Taiwan 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY.  Officials of the Ministry of Justice 
Investigation Bureau (MJIB), Kaohsiung County station, 
recently raided a trading company and its affiliated retail 
shop in Kaohsiung County, Taiwan, and confiscated a large 
quantity of ecstasy and counterfeit Viagra.  The company's 
owner was arrested.  The MJIB inspectors determined that the 
suspect, KO Bao-ji, has been trafficking a variety of 
illicit substances, including ecstasy and Viagra, from China 
into Taiwan for over three years.  The seizure is estimated 
to have a market value of USD 310,000.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  On 21 August 2005, inspectors from MJIB's Kaohsiung 
County office raided the Jing Yiao International Trading 
Company and a shop located at Chiaotou Town, Koahsiung 
County, Taiwan, and seized large quantity of illicit ecstasy 
and Viagra.  The seizure is estimated to have a market value 
of USD 310,000.  The MJIB inspectors arrested the owner of 
the company.  Director Hsiao Hsiang-tai of MJIB Kaohsiung 
County office was reluctant to reveal details of the case, 
but did note that the suspect, 35 years old, named KO Bao-ji 
(STC 2688, 0202-0679) is suspected of carrying on the 
smuggling operation for more than three years.  He has 
smuggled a variety of illicit goods into Taiwan, both by 
using the trading company as a consignee for shipments 
containing the contraband, and by mail.  The suspect has 
also personally traveled to China and carried back drugs for 
sale in his shop.  The suspect is believed to be a major 
wholesaler of illicit drugs and fake Viagra in southern 
Taiwan. 
 
¶3.  Hsiao stated that the county's health unit is examining 
the drugs to determine if they contain components hazardous 
to human health.  According to Hsiao, the health officials 
have stated that the counterfeit Viagra seized has different 
ingredients than those found in the legitimate product.  Due 
to the on-going investigation, investigators would not 
comment further.  AIT/K will follow up as the investigation 
unfolds.
