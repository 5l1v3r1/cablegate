¶1.  (U)  After five weeks of often acrimonious, politicized 
debate, the Fifth (Administrative and Budgetary) Committee, 
on December 21, 2007, adopted the first budget for the 
African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur 
(UNAMID) for the period July 07/June 08 in the amount of 
$1.276 billion - reducing the SYG's proposed budget 
(A/62/380) of $1,477 billion by $201 million.  The Advisory 
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) 
(A/62/540) had recommended a reduction of $150 million.  As 
adopted by the GA in plenary session, the resolution will be 
issued as A/RES/62/232. 
 
¶2.  (U)  In extensive Q and A on the proposed budget - some 
300 questions posed by delegations were answered in writing 
by the Secretariat - and during negotiations on the initial 
95-paragraph draft resolution, Egypt, Pakistan, Russia, Sudan 
and others focused on the non-competitive, single-source 
contract awarded to the US firm, PAE, a Lockheed Martin 
Company, as well as a number of other "extraordinary 
measures" taken by the Secretariat to prepare for the 
deployment of the Operation within the timeframe established 
by the Security Council in resolution 1769 adopted on July 
31, 2007.  As reported in his letter to the GA President on 
October 2, 2007 (A/62/379), the SYG noted that it would be 
necessary for the Secretariat to exercise flexibility in the 
application of administrative policies and procedures in 
order to comply with resolution 1769. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  In the face of often antagonistic questioning by 
the Egyptian delegate, UN Controller Sach firmly defended the 
SYG's decision to award the contract to PAE as being 
authorized by the Financial Regulations and Rules of the 
Organization and the only way to prepare for the deployment 
of the Operation in accordance with the schedule mandated by 
the Security Council.   Egypt blatantly politicized the 
committee's consideration of the proposed budget by 
attempting to somehow leverage its opposition to the contract 
awarded to PAE and other "extraordinary measures" taken by 
the Secretariat, into acceptance of a second Egyptian 
battalion in UNAMID.  At the time of this writing, Egypt's 
efforts in this regard continued to be unsuccessful. 
 
¶4.  (U)  USDel, working closely with Canada, also on behalf 
of Australia and New Zealand, and the UK, on behalf of the 
EU, succeeded in reaching agreement on a relatively balanced 
49-paragraph text.
