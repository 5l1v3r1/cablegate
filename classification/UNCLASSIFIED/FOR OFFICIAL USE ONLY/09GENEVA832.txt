¶1. (SBU) This morning General Council (GC) Chair Matus provided 
Charge with a readout on recent developments on the PA bid.  The 
Israeli's have told him that they oppose the PA's requests for 
observership in GC and the Ministerial Conference because it is 
neither a State nor a customs territory.  On the other side, Egypt 
is insisting that this is not a technical issue.  If one or two WTO 
Members objects, this has to be handled in such a way that it would 
be clear to all WTO Members who they are.  They did not threaten to 
call for a vote but Matus is not sure if this idea has gone away. 
The PA continues to be insistent on achieving their objective but he 
says they have been more moderate in their tone than the Egyptians. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Matus is still expecting to see the formal request from the 
PA on Monday.  He said that he "cannot hide the request" from 
Members.  At a minimum he will circulate the written request to 
Members but he is also thinking of mentioning it during the October 
GC meeting.  He hadn't thought through yet whether that might be 
done as an agenda item or under other business, but he said he would 
consult thoroughly before he decides.  Once Members are all made 
aware of the request he will wait for reactions but he expects this 
to be an issue for the November GC meeting.  (Note - Should Matus 
chose not to say anything on this issue at the GC meeting we can 
expect Egypt, or someone else, to bring it up so we will need to be 
prepared in any event.)
