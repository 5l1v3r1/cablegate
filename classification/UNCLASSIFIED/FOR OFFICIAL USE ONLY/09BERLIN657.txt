12 new cases of H1N1 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The National Reference Center for Influenza at the 
Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in its morning press 
briefings over the weekend 12 new laboratory-confirmed cases 
of H1N1 for Germany.  This increases the total number of 
confirmed cases in Germany to thirty-one (Refs B-E). 
According to the institute, the majority of infections 
occurred in the US; two cases are reported to be human-to- 
human infections. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On May 29, RKI confirmed virus in the man from Baden- 
Wuerttemberg who was reported as a probable case of H1N1 last 
week (Ref A). The 24-year old returned from the US with flu- 
like symptoms. He is reported to be the 20th confirmed case of 
H1N1 in Germany. RKI also confirmed three additional cases of 
H1N1. One man and one woman from North Rhine-Westphalia and 
one man from Saxony-Anhalt tested positive for H1N1 after 
returning from the US with flu-like symptoms. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On May 31, the institute reported that two men from 
North Rhine-Westphalia, one man from Thuringia and one man and 
one woman from Hesse were infected with the virus. In four of 
the five cases, the travelers returned from the US.  In the 
case of the infections in Hesse, media reports that the 47 
year old man passed the virus on to one of his two daughters 
(who did not travel to the US). The man had a high fewer and 
was brought to a hospital for treatment. The daughter is under 
quarantine at home. 
 
¶5. (SBU) RKI announced in its morning press briefing on June 2 
another three laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 for Germany. 
Two men from North Rhine-Westphalia tested positive for the 
virus. According to media, one of the two men had returned 
from the US, while the other was infected by a woman in 
Germany who previously was confirmed the have the virus.  He 
represents the seventh case of human-to-human infection in 
Germany.  RKI also confirmed a woman from Baden-Wuerttemberg 
to have the virus after returning from the US with flu-like 
symptoms. 
 
 
Two Possible Cases of Amcits in Germany Infected with H1N1 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) To date, RKI has only confirmed one case of an 
American in Germany to be infected with the virus (the Amcit 
girl, Berlin 641). According to several media reports, a new 
case in Saxony involves an American businessman who is likely 
to be infected with the virus.  This person has reportedly 
been isolated in a Leipzig hospital after arriving in Germany 
with flu-like symptoms.  Media reports that he is in good 
conditions.
