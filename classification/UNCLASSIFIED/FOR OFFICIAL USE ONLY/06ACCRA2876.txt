SUBJECT: RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR ON RELATIONS WITH GHANA 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On November 21, Russia's newly arrived Ambassador 
to Ghana, Andrey Pokrovskiy, paid a courtesy call on 
Ambassador Bridgewater.  Porkrovskiy noted that Russia is 
politically active in Ghana and is trying to reengage in 
Africa generally.  He was disappointed that Ghana was not 
realizing its potential.  End summary. 
 
Politically Active, Economically Frustrated 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  President Putin's recent visit to South Africa and 
Morocco signaled Russia's serious interest in strengthening 
ties with Africa, according to Pokrovskiy.  He noted that 
Russia's political interaction in Ghana is "quite active", 
with demarches and other diplomatic efforts.  Russia's 
diplomatic relations with Ghana began in 1958 and previous 
assistance included plans to help the GOG prepare to build a 
nuclear research facility in Accra.  After President Nkrumah 
was overthrown in 1966, Russians were expelled and diplomatic 
relations were severed (Note:  the USSR nuclear research 
assistance plan was also scrapped, to be taken up later with 
support from the Chinese.  End note.)  Russia is now working 
to recover from this period and reinvigorate its bilateral 
relationship, Pokrovskiy said.  Russia will move into a new 
embassy in Accra in September, 2007 he said.  He expects a 
delegation from Moscow to Ghana's Jubilee celebrations, 
although it will probably not include President Putin. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Pokrovskiy thought the role of chieftaincy was 
much stronger in Ghana than in other African countries he 
knew, adding that chieftaincy disputes are a significant 
obstacle to Russian investment. He expected Ghana would be 
more developed, even in African terms.  He was disappointed 
that Ghana was not making the most of its tourism potential. 
Russia provides up to thirty scholarships each year to 
Ghanaians to study in Russia, he said.

¶4.  (U)  Andrey Viktorovich Pokrovskiy was appointed 
Ambassador to Ghana in July, 2006, after serving four years 
as Deputy Director and Acting Director of the Security 
Department of the Russian MFA in Moscow.  In 1994, he worked 
as Deputy Provincial Coordinator of the UN peacekeeping 
operation in Mozambique.  His assignments have included 
Zimbabwe (1997-2002), Angola (1984-1986), and Mozambique 
(1979, 1988-1993).  He graduated from the Moscow State 
Institute of International Relations of the MFA in 1979, the 
year he joined the diplomatic service.  He was born October 
2, 1957.  He speaks English and Portuguese.   He is 
personable and mild-mannered, and is already active on the 
Accra social circuit.
