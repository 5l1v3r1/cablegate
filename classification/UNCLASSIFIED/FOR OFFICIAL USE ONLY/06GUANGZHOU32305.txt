¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: EPA Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation 
William Wehrum stressed to Guangdong Province Environmental 
Protection Bureau (EPB) officials that environmental protection, 
public health, and economic development can co-exist.  Wehrum 
commended Guangdong for addressing sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions 
from power plants, and for moving towards emissions trading.  EPB 
officials admitted that the Pearl River Delta (PRD) has highly 
concentrated industrial pollution, but that Chinese government 
leaders are aware of the seriousness of the problem.  Commercial 
opportunities in Guangdong exist for U.S. companies with expertise 
in computer modeling of air pollution.  EPB officials also 
acknowledged that despite the progress made in monitoring air 
pollution, management and technology challenges still exist. 
Guangdong EPB Deputy Director Wang Zikui enthusiastically advocated 
an MOU between the U.S. EPA and the EPB, stressing that the EPB 
needs more experience, technology exchanges, and training in the 
near future.  Wehrum expressed willingness to explore areas for 
increased coordination and cooperation.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) In an October 25th meeting with Guangdong EPB officials, EPA 
Assistant Administrator William Wehrum stressed that environmental 
protection, public health, and economic development can co-exist. 
He commended Guangdong for addressing SO2 emissions from power 
plants, and for moving towards emissions trading. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Guangdong Environmental Monitoring Center Deputy Director 
Zhong Liuju admitted that the PRD has highly concentrated industrial 
pollution, but that Chinese government leaders are aware of the 
seriousness of the problem. 
 
AIR MONITORING NETWORK 
---------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Zhong said that Guangdong Province patterned its air 
quality monitoring system on California's.  The Provincial EPB 
operates 16 air monitoring stations and one mobile monitoring unit. 
These stations monitor SO2, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate 
matter measuring 10 microns (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone 
(O3).  Three stations in the PRD region have the capacity to monitor 
PM2.5. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The delegation visited the Guangdong Environmental 
Information Center (EIC), where real-time data from the 16 
monitoring stations and one mobile unit is collected.  The EIC has 
more than 10 computer workstations and a large LCD screen where the 
real-time data is displayed.  Video feeds of power stations and 
other sites can also be monitored.  A U.S. EPA official in the 
delegation noted that the raw data on the LCD screen showed 
extremely high levels of O3. 
 
COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMPUTER MODELING 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶6. (SBU) Commercial opportunities exist for U.S. companies with 
expertise in computer modeling of air pollution.  Zhong mentioned 
that the EPB has not done much computer modeling of air pollution, 
but that the national Science Ministry has allotted RMB 150 million 
(USD 19.2 million) to develop this capacity.  Guangdong Governor 
Huang Huahua has committed an additional RMB 150 million from the 
Province.  Zhong said that the EPB is currently collecting U.S. 
models that would be suitable for Guangdong's situation and 
modifying them for EPB's use.  Zhong stated that some of these 
projects are open for public tender. 
 
ONGOING POLLUTION CONTROL EFFORTS 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) EPB Deputy Director Wang noted that efforts to control 
 
GUANGZHOU 00032305  002 OF 002 
 
 
power plant emissions are ongoing.  Coal-fired power plants must 
install desulfurization equipment by the end of 2008.  Approximately 
10,000 MW of generators have already installed such equipment, but 
this only represents a relatively small percentage of the total 
generation capacity in Guangdong Province.  Once Guangdong has made 
more progress on reducing SO2 emissions, the EPB will shift its 
focus to reduce nitrogen oxides. 
 
¶8. (U) Local media has reported that by the end of September, the 
Guangdong EPB had dealt with nearly 5,000 cases of environmental 
violations, collected fines of RMB 78 million (approximately USD 10 
million), and shut down 1,300 polluting enterprises. 
 
FURTHER EPA ASSISTANCE NEEDED 
----------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) EPB officials admitted that despite the progress made in 
monitoring air pollution, management and technology challenges still 
exist.  Zhong noted that further assistance is needed in the 
following areas: 
 
-- increasing the pollution inventory technical capability; 
-- localization and source attribution of emission factors; 
-- monitoring technology, ie. laser radar, remote monitoring, and 
online monitoring; and 
-- regional coordination and decision making support, including data 
analysis, information technology, emissions trading, and 
prediction/pre-warning models. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Wang enthusiastically advocated an MOU between the U.S. 
EPA and the Guangdong EPB, stressing that the EPB needs more 
experience, technology exchanges, and training in the near future. 
Wehrum expressed willingness to explore areas for increased 
coordination and cooperation.
