(SBU) PolMilOff delivered Ref A points May 18 to MFA Acting 
Head of Department Omur Unsay emphasizing the importance the 
US placed on strengthening the NSG guidelines as part of 
global nonproliferation efforts.  Unsay noted that Turkey 
agrees on the importance of this issue.  Nevertheless, the 
GOT would be represented in Sweden by the Turkish 
representative to Vienna.  She regretted that nobody from 
Ankara would be able to go.
