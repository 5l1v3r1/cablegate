¶1. (SBU) On November 2, MFA officer Sebnem Incesu 
reiterated Turkey's commitment to assisting Pakistan.  As 
noted in ref B, Turkey's initial pledge of USD 150 million 
led the list of international donors in terms of dollar 
amount.  Incesu stated that a final decision regarding 
what additional assistance Turkey might offer at the next 
donor conference should be forthcoming the week of 
November 7. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to the MFA, Turkey has thus far donated 
supplies and equipment totaling USD 12.6 million and plans 
to provide a total of USD 24.1 million.  In addition it 
has sent seventy search and rescue personnel, 156 Red 
Crescent personnel, three ambulances, three search dogs, 
six vehicles, one motorcycle, and a fifty-bed capacity 
field hospital. 
 
¶3. (SBU) As of October 31, Turkey has provided USD 68 
million of the USD 150 million it has pledged, but it 
remains unclear how much was donated to humanitarian 
assistance and how much to reconstruction. Incesu agreed 
to clarify this for us the week of November 7.  In regards 
to the UN flash appeal, Turkey plans to provide a total of 
USD 3 million to UN organizations as follows: 
  -- UNDP    USD 500,000 
  -- UNICEF  USD 500,000 
  -- WHO     USD 500,000

¶4. (SBU) Comment:  Due to the end of Ramazan holiday, 
which begins at 13:00 in Turkey on November 2 and lasts 
through November 6, many GOT officials are away from the 
office.  Post will follow-up with the MFA during the week 
of November 7 to determine Turkey's plans for the upcoming 
donor conference.  End comment.
