SUBJECT: GOJ RENEWS URGENT REQUEST FOR USG STATEMENT OF 
INTEREST IN CHALABI CASE 
 
REF: AMMAN 814 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (SBU) On April 14 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
transmitted to Post a diplomatic note again urging 
expeditious USG intervention in the Chalabi case.  Text of 
note follows (PDF of Arabic original sent via email to 
NEA/ELA). 
 
¶2. (SBU) BEGIN TEXT: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan presents its compliments to the 
Embassy of the United States of America and in reference to 
Diplomatic Note no. WM/USA/A/650, dated March 12, 2008, the 
Ministry is honored to reiterate to the Embassy its request 
that the U.S. Department of State positively and urgently 
consider providing a Statement of Interest to the competent 
U.S. appellate court regarding the suit that Ahmad Chalabi 
has brought against the Government of Jordan. 
 
The Ministry would like to stress the importance of this 
request to the Government of Jordan, especially given that 
the Government of Jordan's lawyer has presented the required 
appeal-stage preparatory briefing on April 9, 2008, in 
acordance with the timetable set by the competent U.S. 
appellate court.  We note that the possibility for submitting 
a statement of interest will expire at the beginning of next 
week. 
 
The Ministry would be very grateful if the Embassy relayed 
this urgent and important request to the U.S. Department of 
State and urged positive consideration of it. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Hashemite Kingdom of 
Jordan avails of this opportunity to renew to the esteemed 
Embassy of the United States of America the assurances of its 
highest consideration. END TEXT.
