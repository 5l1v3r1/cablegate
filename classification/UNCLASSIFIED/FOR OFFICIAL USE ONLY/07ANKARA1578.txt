SUBJECT: TURKEY: WIPO TREATIES RATIFIED IN MAY 2007 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: On May 8, Turkey published in its Official Gazette 
the ratification of WIPO's Copyright Agreement and Performances and 
Phonograms Treaty, a priority action listed for Turkey in USTR's 
2006 Special 301 report.  Foreign Trade Undersecretariat officials 
tell us that Turkey should complete its approval process and deposit 
its instruments of ratification with WIPO by the end of July. 
According to Ministry of Culture and Tourism officials, Turkey's 
March 2004 amended anti-piracy law and subsequent implementing 
regulations included the provisions of the WIPO treaties and were 
approved by the 2000 TRIPS Council.  Turkish officials would welcome 
training and assistance from Washington agencies on the 
implementation and enforcement of the provisions of these treaties. 
End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On May 8, the Turkish Parliament's ratification of the WIPO 
Copyright Agreement (WCT) and Performances and Phonograms Treaty 
(WPPT) were published in the Official Gazette.  According to Atilla 
Bastirmaci, Head of the America's Department at the Turkish Foreign 
Trade Undersecretariat (FTU), the ratification is with the Council 
of Ministers for final approval, which he characterized as a mere 
formality.  After this final approval, Turkey will deposit its 
instruments of ratification with WIPO in Geneva.  He said that this 
process usually takes about two months from the date of ratification 
and should be completed by the end of July, at the latest. 
Bastirmaci added that ratification of these treaties was a priority 
action for Turkey mentioned in USTR's 2006 Special 301 Priority 
Watchlist report, and Turkish Foreign Trade Minister Tuzmen hopes 
that such action will be viewed favorably by the U.S. when 
considering Turkey's 2008 Special 301 designation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to Selahattin Ertas, Director General in charge 
of IPR issues at the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism, 
Turkey's amended anti-piracy law, which went into effect in March 
2004, and the subsequent implementing regulations were written to 
include the WIPO treaty provisions.  He added that the 2000 WTO 
TRIPS Council examined and approved the draft legislation's 
compliance with international obligations prior to its 
implementation.  Ertas admitted, however, that with new technology 
and the growing availability of the Internet in Turkey, the subject 
is constantly changing and as a result, Turkish policymakers must 
remain current on the issues and amend Turkey's anti-piracy 
provisions accordingly. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Ertas inquired about the availability of training on the 
enforcement of the provisions of the WIPO treaties.  He added that 
he believes the legislation as written is sound, but he is concerned 
about how Turkey will implement and enforce the requirements.  Ertas 
mentioned his interest in learning about special equipment that 
might be used to assist with certification and the tracking of SIC 
codes. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  The Turkish government sees the ratification of 
the WIPO treaties as a positive improvement in their IPR protection 
regime and hopes that it is adequately noted by Washington's IPR 
bureaucracy.  Relevant Turkish authorities such as Culture and 
Tourism and Customs officials are open to subsequent training and 
would welcome assistance from USPTO or other interested Washington 
agencies.  Post is ready to coordinate such training and assistance 
should it become available.  End comment.
