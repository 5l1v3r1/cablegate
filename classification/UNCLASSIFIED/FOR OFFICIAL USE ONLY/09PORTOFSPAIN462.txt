RESOLUTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 118799 
 
¶1.  (SBU)     Post delivered reftel demarche to MFA Multilateral Affairs 
Director Margaret Rousseau November 19.  Rousseau said that 
Trinidad and Tobago will generally continue to vote in favor of 
resolutions on the Middle East as outlined in reftel, particularly, 
she said, "given recent developments in the region."  Specifically, 
she said recent USG statements on the expansion of settlements were 
an "irritation. " 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU)      Rousseau said she agreed with the USG position that 
countries can support the Palestinian people while also supporting 
Israel, and noted that the GOTT has excellent relations with both 
Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as evidenced by official 
visits to both by PM Manning.   She concluded by saying that the 
GOTT is in favor of peaceful coexistence in the Middle East, and 
will consider changing its vote when there is a "change in the 
situation on the ground."
