SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST:P5+1 REFRESHED PACKAGE FOR IRAN 
 
REF: STATE 47017 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request -- please see para 2. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) ACTION:  In advance of Javier Solana,s planned 
June 14 trip to Iran to present the updated P5 1 
incentives package, action posts should immediately brief 
senior host government officials drawing upon the talking 
points in paragraph 4.  With the exception of Damascus, 
host governments of info posts have already been briefed. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  OBJECTIVES: 
 
--To brief host governments on the contents of the updated 
incentives package to Iran. 
 
¶4.  (U)  BEGIN TALKING POINTS: 
 
--Secretary Rice is committed to keeping you -- as a 
partner and good friend -- updated on our diplomatic 
approach to resolving Iran's continued noncompliance with 
its international obligations. 
 
--In early May, the Secretary agreed with her P5 1 
partners to develop an updated version of the June 2006 
incentives package for Iran's consideration. 
 
--This effort is part of the P5 1 dual-track approach 
which seeks to increase pressure on Iran while presenting 
an alternative path including negotiations if Iran 
complies with its international nuclear obligations. 
 
--European Union High Representative for Common Security 
and Foreign Policy Javier Solana will travel to Iran with 
the Political Directors of the UK, France, Germany, 
Russia, and China to present the package to the Iranian 
government this weekend.  Although the US will not take 
part in Solana,s delegation, we are fully committed to 
the package, which includes a letter that all P5 1 Foreign 
Ministers, including Secretary Rice, have signed to 
Foreign Minister Mottaki expressing an interest in 
resolving this issue diplomatically. 
 
--We would like to share with you in advance some of the 
elements of the package. 
 
--The updated package represents a serious effort on the 
part of the P5 1 to find a negotiated solution.  However, 
Iran must restore confidence in the exclusively peaceful 
nature of its nuclear program.  Questions regarding 
Iran,s nuclear activities remain unanswered, particularly 
those associated with nuclear weaponization-related work. 
Iran continues to stone-wall the IAEA,s investigation. 
The recent IAEA Director General,s report made clear that 
Iran continues to withhold cooperation and the IAEA is 
seeking transparency on sensitive activities. 
 
--The suspicions regarding Iran,s nuclear activities have 
damaged its relationships with the international 
community. 
 
--Iran can change the increasingly negative nature of its 
international relations by suspending enrichment-related 
and reprocessing activities, and cooperating fully with 
the IAEA to resolve all outstanding issues. 
 
--If Iran suspends, the P5 1 have agreed to enter into 
negotiations and far-reaching benefits will accrue to the 
Iranian people.  These benefits include: 
 
----Cooperation in support of Iran's peaceful use of 
nuclear energy through the provision of technological and 
financial assistance, support for Iran's construction of 
state-of-the-art light water reactors and guaranteed 
nuclear fuel supply, and cooperation in spent fuel and 
radioactive waste management; 
 
----Dialogue on political and regional security issues, 
but no security assurances; 
 
----Economic engagement, especially support for Iran's 
participation in the World Trade Organization, and 
increased direct investment in and trade with Iran; 
 
----Development of Iran's conventional energy 
infrastructure, consistent with national laws and 
policies; 
 
----Assistance with Iran's agricultural development; and, 
 
----Cooperation with Iran in transportation, civil 
aviation, environmental, emergency response, and 
educational fields. 
 
--We expect Iran to seriously consider the offer made by 
the P5 1. 
 
--The P5 1 intend to widely publicize the contents of the 
updated incentives package, to ensure that the Iranian 
people are well aware of its benefits.  Following 
Solana,s visit, we will provide you with a copy of the 
package. 
 
(FOR ALL POSTS EXCEPT ISRAEL): 
 
--We encourage you to press Iran privately and publicly to 
accept this package.  We believe this package is extremely 
generous. 
 
(FOR ISRAEL): 
 
--We have encouraged our regional partners to press Iran 
privately and publicly to accept this package) 
 
(FOR ALL) 
 
-- The bottom line is that Iran claims it is solely 
interested in a civil nuclear energy program. If this is 
the case, Tehran should accept this package as it provides 
the means and support to build and sustain a modern 
peaceful nuclear energy program while ending Iran,s 
isolation from the international community and expanding 
cooperation in a number of non-nuclear fronts. 
 
--We believe this package presents Iran with a significant 
opportunity and we all look forward to a positive response. 
 
We request a readout from your briefings by opening of 
business on Monday, June 16.  POC is Sara L Horner
