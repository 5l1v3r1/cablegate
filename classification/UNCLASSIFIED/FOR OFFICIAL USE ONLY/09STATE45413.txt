¶1. (U) The Department has reviewed its files and finds 
that it possesses no credible information of gross

the Iraqi Security Forces listed below.  Department 
strongly suggests that visa applications for the

for additional processing procedures that may be 
required.  Note that if, at any time, the Embassy becomes 
aware of any information regarding incidents which could 
be deemed to be credible information of a gross violation 
of human rights by this individual, the Embassy should so 
inform the Department.
