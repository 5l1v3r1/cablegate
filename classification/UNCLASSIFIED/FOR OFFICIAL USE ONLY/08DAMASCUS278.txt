REF: A. 17 APRIL STATE 40480 
     ¶B. DAMASCUS O/I 21 APRIL 
 
¶1.  (SBU) This is the second in a series of Embassy 
Damascus,s updates on Iraqi refugee processing in Syria. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) FACILITIES IMPROVEMENT: Post thanks PRM and 
DHS/USCIS for authorizing funds to improve the interviewing 
rooms (ref A).  Post's Facilities Manager is coordinating 
with the contractor and tentatively planning to conduct the 
work after hours next week.  GSO is working with the DHS Team 
Chief to purchase rugs that should improve acoustics. 
 
¶3. (SBU) SCHEDULE CHANGE: Post is following the 
implementation of the change in the DHS work week, to begin 
on Monday, May 5 (ref A).  This will give the DHS team a 
three-day weekend as the preceding work week will conclude on 
Thursday, May 1.  UNHCR and IOM said that the extra long 
weekend will not reduce the total number of cases this 
circuit ride will complete.  UNHCR was very pleased to hear 
the change was finalized. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) INTERVIEWS:  DHS is currently interviewing 16 cases 
a day.  This number  will increase to 20 interviews a day on 
21 May when the next team arrives.  The next team is 
scheduled to have seven members.  IOM said that they have 
processed over 3000 cases in FY 2008 and are on target to 
meet the goal of 4000 for Syria. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  CIRCUIT RIDER VISAS:  Charge lobbied the MFA this 
week to issue the two pending visas for DHS circuit riders. 
The MFA was non-committal but implied the applications were 
still being processed. Additionally, two of the current DHS 
team members have asked Post to facilitate visa extensions 
in-country.  This would bump up capacity for a few days, 
although immigration can deny extension requests. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  IOM-DHS CHIEFS MEET:  On April 23, the DHS team 
leader paid a courtesy call on the IOM Damascus Chief; 
Conoff attended.  IOM said processing of medicals with the 
panel physicians was proceeding smoothly and IOM Damascus was 
using the WRAPS supplemental program from IOM Cairo to track 
the medicals.  IOM Chief also noted that the IOM staff had 
become more proficient in using WRAPS.  IOM also commented 
that it would like to send more staff for management and 
additional WRAPS training before the case load increases at 
the end of May.  The meeting went well and the chiefs plan to 
meet again next week.  If IOM Amman and/or Cairo can support, 
Post will engage IOM Damascus on specifics. 
 
¶7.  IRAQI REPATRIATION PUSH: Contacts at the Iraqi Embassy 
told us they plan to contact IOM to manage their repatriation 
operation (ref B).  However, IOM Damascus chief told Conoff 
that they have not been approached by the Iraqi Embassy. On a 
seperate but related note, Nadia Jabour, UNHCR Senior 
Resettlement Officer Damascus, told Post that in meetings 
last month between Victor Cochetel, UNHCR Director of 
Resettlement, and the SARG, the SARG repeated assurances that 
they would not forcibly repatriate any Iraqi refugees. 
 
¶8. (SBU) VISITORS: IOM Regional Representative Shahidul Haque 
will be in Damascus 28 April ) May 1 and will meet with the 
Charge as well as representatives at UNHCR.
