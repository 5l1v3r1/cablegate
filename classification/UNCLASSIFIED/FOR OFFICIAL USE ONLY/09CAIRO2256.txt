KAMAL H. ASAD - CASE NO. K-0893 
 
REF: STATE 99502 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel request, Pol Off met with 
Habib Debs, President and General Manager of Sigma 
International.  Pol Off was unable to meet with the 
individual listed as the broker, Kamal Asad.  Debs said he 
himself was the principal officer.  Debs said that most of 
his business was done through his American company, Advanced 
Technology Systems Company.  At the moment, Sigma was not 
doing any business with American companies, but he maintained 
the broker registration in case any new projects came up. 
Debs confirmed that he was authorized by the Egyptian 
Ministry of Defense to conduct brokering activities in Egypt. 
 Sigma does not physically handle or store any items on the 
United States Munitions List (USML).  The company was 
established in the late 1970s.  Debs confirmed that he was 
familiar with restrictions on USML items, including the 
unauthorized re-transfer and re-export of items. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Debs said that one of Sigma's current projects was 
to provide spare parts for 250 Russian armored personnel 
carriers and their French engines for the Egyptian army.
