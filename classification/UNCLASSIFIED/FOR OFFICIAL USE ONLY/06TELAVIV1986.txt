SUBJECT: JUSTICE MINISTER ON CITIZENSHIP LAW 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Minister of Justice Haim Ramon told the Ambassador 
May 16 that the GOI will reform its Nationality and Entry in 
Israel Law of 2003 to ensure that it conforms with 
international standards.  This temporary law currently 
prohibits many Palestinian spouses of Israeli citizens from 
residing in Israel.  (Note: The Knesset amended the law in 
2005 to allow Palestinian men over 35 and women under 25 the 
right to apply for residency status.  The law expires at the 
end of June and must be re-enacted.  End note.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Claiming Israel has a sovereign right to determine 
who may become a citizen and who may enter the country, Ramon 
said that the the new law will ensure that Jewish applicants 
for citizenship receive "special treatment," and that all 
others receive "equal treatment."  "We will not hide behind 
security requirements," Ramon explained, in providing to all 
non-Jews equal opportunities for Israeli citizenship without 
discrimination based on race, religion, or prior nationality. 
 Ramon said, however, that the new law will limit the 
possibilities of citizenship or residency for applicants from 
enemy states (including, he specified, the Palestinian 
Authority), applicants without prospects for financial 
independence, and applicants who refuse to respect Israel's 
customs.  "We will follow the model of Europe's most tolerant 
nations," Ramon claimed, referring specifically to a law in 
Denmark that he claims favors Nordic applicants for 
citizenship, and to a law in Holland that he claims requires 
applicants to respect Dutch customs. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Other issues covered in the meeting - - including 
convergence, illegal outposts, trafficking in persons, Magen 
David Adom, and intellectual property rights - - are covered 
in septels.
