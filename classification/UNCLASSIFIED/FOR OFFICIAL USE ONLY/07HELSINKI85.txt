PROPOSAL 
 
REF: STATE 04858 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Finnish government has yet to form an 
official position on the recent EU aviation 
emissions proposal, according to Finnish Ministry of 
Transport and Communications officials Anne Torkkeli 
and Topi Siren on February 1.  Although Finland 
believes aviation emissions should be addressed, it 
is in the process of examining all options before 
taking an official position.  The Finnish 
interagency taskforce assigned to this issue (from 
the Ministries of Transport and Communications, 
Environment, and Foreign Affairs) wants to review 
results of the upcoming meeting of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Committee on 
Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) before 
finalizing a decision.  Additionally, the GOF has 
requested the EU Councils Legal Services to provide 
clarification on ICAO's legal position regarding 
aviation emissions. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Finnish officials have internally discussed 
the issue, using 2012 and the post-Kyoto period as a 
natural timeframe for initiating a more concrete 
program for all emissions, including aviation.  They 
also noted that due to Finland's isolated geography, 
aviation plays a key role in connecting Finland to 
Europe.  Finland does not want to see any EU policy 
that would discriminate against it by making air 
travel considerably more difficult or expensive.
