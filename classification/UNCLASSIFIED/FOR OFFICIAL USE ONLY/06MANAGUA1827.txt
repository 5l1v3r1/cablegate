SUBJECT: NICARAGUA ELECTIONS: OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN SEASON 
BEGINS 
 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) 
launched the official campaign season with a ceremony on 
August 18.  CSE president Roberto Rivas used the occasion to 
admonish observer groups and remind the public that the CSE 
is the final arbiter of the November 5 national elections. 
On August 20, the Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC) staged a 
large rally in the town of Sebaco, which was not attended by 
PLC leader Arnoldo Aleman or his family.  The Nicaraguan 
Liberal Alliance (ALN), Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS), 
and Alternative for Change (AC) parties held smaller 
gatherings in rural areas.  In a departure from previous 
campaign seasons, the Sandinista Front (FSLN) has decided to 
focus on door-to-door campaigning rather than a giant rally. 
End Summary. 
 
CSE Formally Opens Campaign Season

¶2. (U) The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) marked the formal 
opening of the electoral campaign season with a ceremony on 
August 18.  The CSE magistrates presided, with 
representatives from the political parties, GON, Supreme 
Court, armed forces, police, diplomatic corps, and other 
observers.  All presidential candidates were present except 
Edmundo Jarquin (MRS) and Daniel Ortega (FSLN), who sent 
campaign manager (and wife) Rosario Murillo in his place. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Notably, the CSE chose retired Archbishop of 
Managua, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, to deliver the 
opening remarks.  (Comment: Obando, aside from being 
officially "retired," is now regarded as a supporter of the 
FSLN.  Many regarded his presence on stage with the CSE 
magistrates as highly inappropriate given his status as a 
Catholic Church prelate and his political affiliations.  End 
Comment.)  CSE president Roberto Rivas gave the principal 
address, in which he praised Obando y Bravo for his 
commitment to Nicaraguan democracy and his CSE colleagues for 
their "professional and objective" efforts.  Rivas announced 
that the CSE will open dozens of cedulation stations in 
Managua on August 19 to attend citizens that have not yet 
applied before the deadline -- he commented that the CSE has 
registered "very few citizens in relation to the massive 
numbers that some claim lack cedulas."  Glaring at the OAS 
delegation, Rivas sternly reminded the audience that the CSE 
is in charge of the electoral process, not observer groups. 
 
PLC Opens Campaign in Sebaco, Aleman and Family Absent

¶4. (U) The PLC officially opened their campaign in Sebaco, 
Matagalpa on August 20 with thousands of supporters and a 
strong, anti-FSLN message.  Former president Arnoldo Aleman 
and his family were conspicuously absent.  (Comment: 
According to the Rizo campaign, Aleman's absence is "proof" 
that Aleman does not control the party and that he and his 
family are complying with the various requests from Rizo's 
supporters to distance themselves from the presidential 
campaign.  End Comment.) 
 
¶5. (U) PLC presidential candidate, Jose Rizo, declared 
himself 'anti-pacto' and promised to free Nicaragua from the 
grip of the FSLN by breaking the hold of the pact.  He 
invoked strong words against FSLN candidate Daniel Ortega, 
declaring that he hopes that Ortega will resign from 
Nicaraguan politics after losing the upcoming election.  Rizo 
used ALN candidate Eduardo Montealegre's own campaign slogan 
"sowing opportunities" to criticize him, saying he would only 
"sow opportunities for other bankers."  PLC vice presidential 
candidate Jose Antonio Alvarado claimed that Rizo is 
"untouched by scandal," unlike front-runners Ortega (the 
pinata) or Montealegre (Cenis).  PLC sources claimed that 
250,000-300,000 people attended the rally, with many 
supporters brought in using 3,000 buses, but actual turnout 
was probably 30,000-50,000. 
 
ALN, MRS, and AC also Open Campaigns in Rural Regions

¶6. (U) The ALN, MRS, and AC also opened their campaigns on 
August 19 and 20 with reasonable turnout and strong messages. 
 ALN candidate Eduardo Montealegre was found dancing with a 
traditional dancer at his opening in Bluefields on the 
Atlantic Coast, where he vowed to beat Ortega in November. 
He said that the FSLN and the PLC represent "the past, 
misery, corruption, and war."  Montealegre and running mate

Fabricio Cajina visited Bluefields, Laguna de Perlas, and 
Corn Island during their Atlantic Coast tour, pledging to 
devote more time and attention to the neglected region, 
should Montealegre win the Presidency.  (Note: The ALN is 
also planning a rally in Managua on August 27.  End Note.) 
 
¶7. (U) Although the MRS and AC did not plan official campaign 
events, MRS candidate Edmundo Jarquin opened his campaign in 
the northwestern department of Chinandega, where he plans to 
visit 60 percent of the municipalities in that department. 
AC candidate Eden Pastora opened the AC campaign in Rivas. 
Pastora plans to present the AC government plan on August 22 
in Managua. 
 
¶8. (SBU) FSLN campaign manager Rosario Murillo announced to 
the public that the FSLN will not hold a traditional rally to 
launch their campaign, rather, the party will focus on 
"personal" door-to-door campaigning, a "pilgrimage to the 
people" in Murillo's words.  (Comment: The FSLN has been 
mocked in the past for "filling the plazas, but not the 
voting booths," and Ortega suffered strong criticism for his 
July 19th appearance at the Anniversary of the Sandinista 
Revolution wearing the Nicaraguan flag and riding into the 
park on a horse, a scene reminiscent of the former Somoza 
dictatorship.  End Comment.)
