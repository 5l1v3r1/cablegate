¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel points to the Office of 
Eastern and Southern European Affairs at the Egyptian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs on September 1.  We stressed USG 
concerns over Serbia's request for a UNGA resolution seeking 
an International Court of Justice (ICJ) advisory opinion on 
Kosovo's independence.  Third Secretary Karim Fathi Saad 
stated that Egypt had no official stance on the ICJ advisory 
opinion.  He informed us that Serbian Foreign Minister 
Jeremic met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Abu al-Ghayt in 
early August to advocate for Serbia's position.  Egypt 
listened to the Serbian argument, but has not responded to 
the Serbians.  However, he wondered what could be wrong with 
having the Serbian request for an ICJ opinion play out at the 
UN. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Saad noted that Egypt was taking a very cautious 
approach to the Kosovo issue.  The Government of Egypt is 
concerned with the implications of that Kosovo declaration of 
independence will have on other countries.  "We live in an 
unstable region and we are concerned about the implications 
that the Kosovo issue will have in our area", he said.  He 
also pointed out that Kosovo's situation was no longer unique 
and precipitated the situation in South Ossetia and 
Abkahazia.  He stated that the position of the GOE is that 
issues of independence and recognition should be resolved by 
consensus in the UNSC with the participation and concurrence 
of the involved parties.
