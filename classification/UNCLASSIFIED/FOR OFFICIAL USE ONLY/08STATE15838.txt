SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050087908 
 
REF: BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 2006 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on application 050087908 for the export 
of infrared searchlight equipment to Russia.  Post is 
requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. 
 Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending 
and future applications involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Reason for request:  foreign end-user and consignee 
are both on PM/DTCC's Watchlist; vague and suspicious end-use 
statement; possible involvement of an unregistered broker. 
Foreign end-user Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant is on PM/DTCC's 
Watchlist and has never had its bona fides verified by a Blue 
Lantern check.  An additional cause for concern is the 
end-use statement that the infrared searchlight equipment 
will be installed on a helicopter owned by Ulan Ude, which 
purportedly will be operated by the company on behalf of the 
Russian Federal Customs Service.  In addition, foreign 
intermediate consignee Avitronics International AB appears to 
be acting as a broker in this proposed transaction.  However, 
the company is not registered with the Department's 
Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (PM/DDTC) as a broker 
of USML parts, as required under U.S. law.  Embassy Moscow 
should make appropriate inquiries to verify the bona fides of 
Ulan Ude and confirm the legitimacy of the proposed 
transaction.  Embassy Stockholm should make appropriate 
inquiries to determine whether Avitronics is acting as a 
broker in this proposed transaction and whether the company 
is aware that U.S. law requires brokers of USML items to 
register with PM/DDTC.  The following questions are provided 
as suggested guidance: 
 
For the Russian Federal Customs Service, Siberian Department, 
Buryatia Branch: 
 
--Have you hired Ulan Ude to use its helicopters to perform 
services on behalf of your agency? 
 
--If so, does Ulan Ude require an infrared searchlight?  What 
exact services will Ulan Ude performing on behalf of the 
Russian Federal Customs Service? 
 
For Ulan Ude Aviation Plant: 
 
--Does the company have proper supporting documentation, 
including a contract from the Russian Federal Customs 
Service, for this proposed transaction? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 Does the company understand that USML items may be used only 
for the specific purpose stated on the export license? 
 
For Avitronics International AB: 
 
--Please describe your role in this proposed transaction. 
 
--If serving as a broker in this proposed transaction, are 
you aware that U.S. law requires brokers of USML items to 
register with the State Department and to obtain prior 
authorization for many brokered transactions?
