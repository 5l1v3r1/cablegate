ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION 
 
¶1. (SBU) On October 23, 2008, Haji Juma Khan arrived at the 
Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta, Indonesia 
aboard Emirates Airways Flight EK 356. Khan, one of 
Afghanistan's most notorious heroin traffickers, is a 
fugitive tribal leader in Afghanistan and a U.S. Department 
of Justice narcotics fugitive. Upon Khan's arrival, 
Indonesian police and immigration authorities denied him 
entry based upon an active Interpol red notice for heroin 
trafficking and material support of terrorist organizations. 
These charges resulted from an investigation by DEA's 
bilateral investigations unit based in Chantilly, Virginia, 
with assistance by DEA Singapore country office. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Because of the Indonesian National Police's 
effective response, Khan immediately faced justice. After 
attempting to enter Indonesia at 4 p.m., he was detained and 
then expelled from Indonesia approximately five (5) hours 
later at 9 p.m. Due to outstanding cooperation by the 
Indonesian National Police, Khan appeared in the Southern 
District of New York at approximately 4 p.m. on October 24, 
¶2008. Khan was remanded into custody for violations of Title 
21 U.S.C. Section 960a and 963. 
 
¶3. (U) Please direct any and all questions to CA Russell C. 
Holske, SA Stephen Will, or SA Lance Ho at the Singapore 
Country Office at (65) 6476-9021.
