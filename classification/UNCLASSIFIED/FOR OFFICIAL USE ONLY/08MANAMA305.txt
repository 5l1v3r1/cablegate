(SBU) Post has undertaken the following actions in support of 
the Day of Solidarity with the Cuban People set for May 21: 
 
--Embassy Manama's public affairs section is working to place 
the reftel op-ed under the signature of the Charge d'Affaires 
in the local English-language press on May 21.  We have 
inquired with NEA/PPD about the availability of an 
Arabic-language version of the op-ed so that we may pursue 
placement in local Arabic papers as well. 
 
--The Embassy plans to issue a press statement on May 21 
drawing upon reftel background materials and expressing 
solidarity with the Cuban people. 
 
--We have explained the Day of Solidarity with the Cuban 
People to the government and have encouraged the GOB to 
undertake its own expression of solidarity on May 21 by 
calling attention to the Cuban regime's poor record on human 
rights. 
 
--We have explained the Day of Solidarity with the Cuban 
People to local NGOs and have encouraged them to speak out on 
May 21 in support of fellow human rights activists in Cuba. 
We have also provided reftel website information and 
encouraged them to link to the sites from their own home 
pages and to call upon their membership to sign the 
electronic petitions.
