¶1.  (U) Summary: Colombian Foreign Minister Maria Araujo made 
her first official visit to Ecuador on August 16.  In 
meetings with Foreign Minister Francisco Carrion and Vice 
President Alejandro Serrano she discussed the need for 
safeguarding bilateral relations in the face of problems 
along the common border, reaffirmed Colombia's commitment to 
maintain suspension of aerial fumigations along the sensitive 
border region, reinforced the need to cooperate in the fight 
against international crime, and with Carrion agreed to 
encourage greater cooperation between the Colombian and 
Ecuadorian militaries on border security issues.  The visit 
was well received and will likely help further bilateral 
relations.  A border development agreement is set for signing 
on September 7.  End Summary. 
 
Carrion-Araujo Meeting Positive 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) In her first official visit to Ecuador since assuming 
the top Colombian diplomatic spot, Foreign Minister Maria 
Araujo on August 16 met with Ecuadorian Foreign Minister 
Francisco Carrion and later paid a courtesy call on Vice 
President Alejandro Serrano.  Araujo told the press that Plan 
Colombia is a very important tool in the international fight 
against narcotrafficking, but said that it should not be an 
obstacle to positive Ecuador-Colombia bilateral relations. 
She also reaffirmed Colombia's commitment to maintain 
temporary suspension of aerial fumigations within 10 
kilometers of the Ecuadorian border. 
 
¶3.  (U) Araujo agreed to push forward efforts to repatriate 
Colombian refugees resident in Ecuador.  Addressing the 
Victor Enriquez shooting (reftel), she said that the case is 
being investigated by the Ipiales Prosecutor's office.  Both 
ministers agreed that greater military cooperation was needed 
to guarantee the security of residents living in the troubled 
border region.  The ministers also agreed to sign the 
Binational Plan for Border Zone Integration on September 7-8 
near the Rumichaca border crossing point in Tulcan, Carchi. 
 
Carrion Stresses GOE Position 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (U) In a joint press conference after their meeting, 
Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Francisco Carrion reaffirmed 
Ecuador's non-intervention policy with respect to Colombia's 
internal conflict.  He emphatically pointed out that Ecuador 
does not consider the Manta Forward Operating Location (FOL) 
to be part of Plan Colombia, a bilateral agreement involving 
only the U.S. and Colombia.  The FOL's location in Ecuador 
represents Ecuador's contribution to the international fight 
against narcotrafficking, Carrion said. 
 
Araujo Departs; Bilats Continue 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) The Ecuador-Colombia Binational Commission convened 
on August 17 in Quito following the August 16 ministerial. 
The Ecuadorian MFA confirmed that the meeting will focus on 
resolving a pending border demarcation issue in Cerro Troya, 
Carchi. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Carrion's efforts to smooth relations with Colombia 
by increasing bilateral communication mechanisms for border 
issues and focusing the overall relationship on a wider range 
of bilateral issues has helped the two countries build a more 
solid bilateral foundation and this visit cemented those 
improved ties in a very public way.  Press coverage of 
Araujo's visit was very positive here, highlighting goodwill 
on both sides. Bilateral communication between civil and 
military officials on development and security issues is 
improving.  Araujo made a positive debut in Ecuador and 
demonstrated a good understanding of the sensitivities in the 
relationship.  Her prospects for deepening bilateral ties 
begun under her predecessor appear good.
