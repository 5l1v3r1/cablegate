¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  In meetings at the UN and at USAID, NGO 
officials outlined a systematic campaign by the Government of Sudan 
to seize assets and harass staff of the NGOs expelled in the wake of 
the ICC announcement on March 4. Post will continue to protest the 
harassment of NGOs and Amcits to GoS officials, and has offered 
assistance to NGO staff members as they depart the country. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On March 8, 2009, CDA and conoff attended meetings at 
UNMIS and USAID with UN officials, Chiefs of Mission, Consular 
officers, and NGO Country Directors to discuss the harassment of 
NGOs and their staffs, following the expulsions of thirteen 
international NGOs by the GoS. They recounted numerous cases of GoS 
officials entering NGO compounds to seize NGO assets and personal 
property, as well as ongoing difficulties facing NGO workers 
attempting to leave, but whose passports are held by security 
officials. Expatriates working for these NGOs have been intimidated 
by GoS from contacting their Embassies for assistance, as HAC 
routinely increases pressure on NGOs who reach out to an Embassy for 
support. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) NGO officials recounted several cases of armed security 
officers entering compounds to seize assets, then squabbling amongst 
themselves for the spoils.  A PADCO representative stated that GOS 
Customs officials and (Humanitarian Affairs Commission) HAC officers 
appeared at the NGO office and began to fight over who would get the 
vehicles. An ACF employee said, "Our office was taken on the 5th at 
lunchtime. Police and HAC were fighting over who should get our 
mini-bus".  After seizing vehicles from CHF, security officials 
demanded that the NGO fill up the gas tank before they drove off. 
Save the Children USA's El Geneina, Darfur warehouse was raided by 
men in uniform driving large trucks who carried off 6-8 months of 
medical supplies intended for IDPs donated by AMERICARES. 
 
¶4. (SBU) None of the NGOs were given a legal justification for these 
seizures and were informed that the 2006 Protocol governing GoS 
obligations to NGOs does not apply, as the ICC created a state of 
emergency. The NGOS have been informed that they must pay varying 
lengths of extended severance pay, averaging 6-7 months, to their 
national staff.  At the same time, GoS has frozen the NGOs' bank 
accounts, making it difficult for them to transfer money to Sudan. 
HAC officials have directed NGOs to transfer the severance pay 
directly to the GoS, and claim that GoS will issue the pay to the 
local employees. NGO officials remaining in Kh`rtoum to facilitate 
this cash transfer expressed concern that these funds will not end 
up in the hands of their employees. The NGOs are attempting to 
negotiate a mechanism to comply with the GoS demand to provide 
severance pay, while securing some assurance that the money will 
actually end up in the hands of the now-unemployed national staff. 
 
¶5. (SBU) While many expatriate staff of the expelled NGOs have 
already departed Sudan, some NGO officials, including Country 
Directors, have had to remain until their assets have been 
transferred to the GoS and report feeling as iv they arg "held 
hostagdQ.  C-edra( Haq,0UN Hum`ni4apien AoordinitOrntf$ hgTQQ&xoywjo kQr stayudjmun&dWm&|nct&Qi}pQ::AF!c$oqc,sQeQh}z2g QYpc3wsTtc}6wadfQvo%1~hhq%aQ&QtViwp'BBMcW["lQ N|V.~mnholder's respective NGO hands over whatever assets have been 
demanded by the GoS. Passports have been taken from at least four 
French Solidarities employees and four Canadians NGO workers. The 
passport of the Country Director of PADCO, an Iraqi national, has 
also been seized, as have passports of Kenyan and Croatian PADCO 
employees. One Canadian NGO official was allegedly informed that if 
he did not cooperate and turn over money and assets of his NGO, he 
could be arrested and tried in connection with the ICC proceedings. 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) To Embassy Khartoum's knowledge, at least three US 
passports are being held by GoS officials, including passports 
belonging to Amcit employees of Mercy Corps and CHF, though the 
Mercy Corps passports are expected to be released soon. An 
additional passport belonging to an IOM employee has been pending 
issuance of an exit visa for one week, though this may be a result 
of GoS disorganization rather than malevolence. Some NGO Directors 
have reported that exit visas for departing staff are now being 
issued quickly.  One passport belonging to CHF Country Director John 
DeStefano (protect) is being held by HAC until the transfer of 
assets from CHF to HAC is completed. Mr. DeStefano is considering 
whether he would like the US Embassy to weigh in with the GoS 
directly regarding his case, but like many NGO workers, is concerned 
that the GoS will treat him worse should the Embassy intervene.

¶7. (SBU) The GoS has routinely punished foreign aid workers for 
reaching out to their embassies. When CDA protested the February, 
2009 seizure of assets of USAID funded PADCO, HAC Director Hassabo 
responded by expelling PADCO's country director (reftel). (NOTE: 
Embassy Khartoum has submitted request to revoke visa issued to 
Hassabo in July 2008. CA/VO is currently determining applicable 
grounds for the revocation. END NOTE.) The Norwegian Consul reports 
that the Norwegian Refugee Council was punished for contacting the 
Norwegian Embassy to report harassment of its staff.  After the 
meeting at UNMIS, an OCHA official told conoff that most harassment 
taking place is not reported to Embassies by NGOs for fear of GoS 
retribution and that many Amcits affected by the harassment have 
refrained from contacting the Embassy. 
 
¶8. (SBU) NGO officials have reported that their national staff have 
faced GoS pressure and intimidation and are highly vulnerable as the 
NGOs depart, particularly if GoS will be in control of their 
severance pay. The GoS has already declared that it will investigate 
alleged wrong-doing of the expelled NGOs and has called in national 
staff of several NGOs for daily questioning.  Save The Children USA 
reports that security officials have been in camps asking which of 
their national staffers had reported instances of rape.  ACF has 
reported instances of national staff being detained and beaten by 
security officials. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Comment: CDA has repeatedly raised the issue of NGO 
expulsion and harassment with high level officials in the GoS. 
Conoff will arrange meeting with Head of Consular Affairs at MFA for 
CDA to protest the harassment of Amcits and seizure of passports. 
Post has updated the Sudan Travel Warning to note increase in 
harassment of Amcits, which has been submitted to CA for clearance. 
Conoff is contacting MFA on behalf of Amcits in specific cases when 
the Amcit requests Embassy representation, and has offered 
assistance to international NGO staff when they are departing Sudan 
to try to limit harassment to the extent possible.  End comment.
