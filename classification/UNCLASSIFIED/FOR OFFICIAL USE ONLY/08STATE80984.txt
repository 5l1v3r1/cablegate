SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSES 050068901, 050071121, 050081551, AND 050082501 
 
REF: A. SINGAPORE 427 
     ¶B. BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 2006 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-5. 
 
¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on licenses 050068901, 050071121, 
050081551, and 050082501 for the export of zinc selenide to 
Taiwan.  AIT Taipei and Embassy Singapore are requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Reason for request:  follow-on check due to previous 
unfavorable Blue Lantern check on application 050093417, 
which found that foreign consignee Wavelength Technology 
Singapore Pte. Ltd. sends all raw materials it receives to 
its facility in China for manufacturing (ref A).  China is a 
proscribed destination for United States Munitions List 
(USML) commodities, such as the ones exported under subject 
licenses, under Section 126.1 of the U.S. International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Wavelength is on 
PM/DTCC's Watch List.  AIT Taipei and Embassy Singapore 
should make appropriate inquiries to determine if foreign 
end-user Legend Laser in Taiwan has received the zinc 
selenide listed on these licenses or if Legend Laser received 
components manufactured using the zinc selenide.  AIT Taipei 
and Embassy Singapore should also determine if the zinc 
selenide was re-exported to China for manufacturing, and if 
so, what manufacturing processes were employed.  Department 
requests that AIT Taipei conduct a site visit to Legend Laser 
in order to provide Department with an assessment of its 
business operations and on-site security.  If a site visit is 
not possible, please inform PM/DTCC case officer.  Since 
Embassy Singapore has already conducted a site visit to 
Wavelength Technology, Department defers to post's judgment 
on the need or desirability of one in connection with this 
check.  The following questions are offered as guidance for 
AIT Taipei and Embassy Singapore. 
 
¶4. (U) Questions for AIT Taipei to ask Legend Laser: 
 
--Did the company receive from Wavelength Technology all of 
the zinc selenide listed on these four licenses?  Or did the 
firm instead receive from Wavelength Technology finished or 
partially finished components that were manufactured using 
the zinc selenide? 
 
--Did the company receive the units of zinc selenide?  Or did 
the company receive components containing zinc selenide that 
were manufactured by Wavelength Technology?  If so, were the 
components shipped to the company from Wavelength 
Technology's facilities in Singapore or its facilities in 
China? 
 
--Did Legend Laser order from Wavelength Technology the exact 
type and quantity of items listed on this application?  Did 
Legend Laser order anything else from Wavelength, either 
currently or in the past? 
 
--What did Legend Laser do with the materials or devices that 
it received from Wavelength?  If Legend Laser stored the 
items listed on the application, does it have secure 
facilities and proper accounting and security procedures for 
handling these sensitive USML items? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what types of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What types of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located?  Are any of its 
customers located in China? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
¶5. (U) Questions for Embassy Singapore to ask Wavelength 
Technology: 
 
--Was the zinc selenide listed on these four licenses 
re-exported to one or both of the company's facilities in 
China for manufacturing? 
 
--Who exactly in China manufactured or modified the 
materials?  (COMMENT:  If possible, please obtain exact 
contact information, including names, addresses, phone 
numbers, fax numbers, and e-mail addresses.  END COMMENT.) 
 
--Are all materials that the company sends to China returned 
to Wavelength's office in Singapore?  Or are some sent 
directly to other customers in China and other countries?  If 
so, what other countries and what other firms? 
 
--What other customers in China does Wavelength Technology 
have? 
 
--Is Wavelength Technology involved in any joint business 
partnerships or ventures with other businesses, especially in 
China? 
 
--What is the use for the zinc selenide (ZnSe) devices? 
Light emitting diodes or diode lasers? 
 
--During the manufacturing process, are the devices doped 
with chromium (ZnSe:Cr) or tellurium (ZnSe:Te)? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 Does the company understand that China is a proscribed 
destination for USML items under U.S. laws and regulations? 
 
END ACTION.
