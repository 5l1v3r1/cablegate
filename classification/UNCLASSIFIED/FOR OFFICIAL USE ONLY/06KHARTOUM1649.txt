SUBJECT:  MINAWI NOMINATED SENIOR ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 1635 
 
¶1. (U) A SLM/A-Minawi delegation led by Dr. Al Rayeh Mahmoud 
presented the nomination of SLM/A leader Minni Minawi for the 
DPA-established post of Senior Assistant to the President on July 
¶11.  The post is the fourth in the chain of command from the 
presidency.  Mahmoud and the SLM/A-Minawi delegation had hoped to 
present the nomination to the Presidency, but had to settle for 
Presidential Advisor and the head of the GNU delegation to the Abuja 
talks Dr. Magzoub Al Khalifa. 
 
¶2. (U) As Senior Assistant to the President, Minawi would be a 
member of the National Council of Ministers, National Security 
Council, and National Council of Planning.  He would also chair the 
Transitional Darfur Regional Authority, a DPA-stipulated interim 
governing authority for Darfur prior to national elections in 
2008-9. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Per a discussion reported through AU DPA Implementation 
Lead Ambassador Sam Ibok later that day, Khalifa said that the GNU 
expected the position for Senior Assistant to be filled by one of 
the signatories of the DPA.  As Minawi is the only movement leader 
to have signed the DPA, barring any last minute movement from 
SLM/A-Abdel Wahid to sign, Minawi was the presumed candidate. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The SLM/A-Minawi "advance team" that presented Minawi's 
nomination included Minawi's deputy, Rayah Mahmud, Secretary General 
Mustafa Teyrab, and Military Commander-in-Chief Guma Hagar.  The 
advance team has been in Khartoum for approximately two weeks trying 
to organize politically, develop candidate lists for the numerous 
positions and commissions established under the DPA, and prepare for 
Minawi's arrival.  However, yesterday's nomination was limited only 
to the position of Senior Assistant, and it is unclear when the 
nominations for other positions will follow.  Meanwhile, Minawi 
appears unlikely to arrive in Khartoum before he departs for his 
visit to Washington.  (NOTE: The advance team itself is housed in 
difficult conditions at a trailer park-style hotel and has little 
choice but to wait for the DPA Implementation Office to open or for 
donors to provide furnishings and equipment to a recently acquired 
headquarters building before it can mobilize more efficiently.  END 
NOTE).
