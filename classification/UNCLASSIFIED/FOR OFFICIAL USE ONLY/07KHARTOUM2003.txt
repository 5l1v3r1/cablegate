¶1. (SBU) Media reported on December 12 that Joint Defense Board 
(JDB) spokesman Lt. General Abdalrahman Mohammed Zain said that 
Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army 
(SPLA) forces will begin redeployment consistent with the 1/1/56 
border the weekend of December 14.  SPLA forces will immediately 
redeploy out Abumatarig and Dibb (in Western Kordofan) and SAF 
forces will mirror this movement out of South Sudan. 
 
¶2. (SBU) This announcement reflects the decision of the December 3 
Ceasefire Joint Monitoring Committee (CJMC), which established the 
following timetable for redeployment of forces from Southern Sudan, 
Blue Nile and Southern and Western Kordofan: 
 
- SAF & SPLA are to be redeployed North and South respectively by 
33.3 percent by December 15; 
- SAF & SPLA are to be redeployed North and South respectively by 
66.7 percent by December 31; 
- Full redeployment for both sides to complete by January 9, 2008. 
- Concurrent redeployment of Joint Integrated Units (JIU) by January 
9, 2008. 
- Missiriya militia from Western Kordofan to be redeployed to the 
South by December 15. 
 
¶3. (SBU) UN Deputy Force Commander Colonel Aja Sah told poloff on 
December 13 that based on the December 3 Kampala CJMC, UNMIS would 
monitor SAF/SPLA redeployments which should be completed by January 
9, 2008.  Sah said that to date he had not seen any SAF or SPLA 
operational orders yet, but stressed that Joint Monitoring Teams 
(JMT) are ready to monitor any movement if they take place this 
weekend.  Asked which specific SAF and SPLA units plan to start 
moving this weekend, Sah replied, "I am looking for such a plan as 
well." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Commander of the JIU, Lt. General Thomas Cirillo, told 
emboff on November 29 that while JIUs are considered 82 percent 
redeployed or at least co-located, substantial obstacles to the 
completion of the redeployment of the rest remain.  These included 
lack of accommodations, water, medical support services, 
infrastructure, communication equipment, and logistical transport 
equipment.  Without overcoming these major obstacles, JIUs cannot be 
redeployed to takeover from the redeployed SAF/SPLA forces, 
especially with such a tight schedule. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The number of SAF troops to be redeployed number 
3,600 while estimates of SPLA forces to be redeployed exceed 50,000 
(the SPLA may have inflated their numbers but they are the ones who 
provided them).  The size of the forces to be moved necessitates 
careful planning, which we have not seen and is unusual in Sudan 
under the best circumstances.  These logistical problems are 
compounded by the agreement to concurrently redeploy the JIUs to 
take over for the redeployed SAF/SPLA forces, which is also unlikely 
to occur so quickly. We would expect some furtive troop movements 
this weekend followed by a hold-in-place of some troops.  Some 
soldiers may simply have to be "re-branded" as JIU troops.  The next 
CJMC meeting is scheduled for December 17.
