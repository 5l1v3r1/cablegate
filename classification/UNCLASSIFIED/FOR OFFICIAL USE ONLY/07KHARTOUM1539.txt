------------------------------------------ 
Governor Warns of Focus on Tribal Divisions 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Meeting with S/E Natsios in Nyala on September 30, 
South Darfur Governor Ali Mahmoud explained that the current 
conflict had exacerbated tribal divisions.  He criticized the 
peace process for re-inforcing these divisions and warned 
that if the parties to the conflict participated in 
negotiations along ethnic lines, tribal-based political 
parties would emerge and further undermine the region's 
stability.  Nonetheless emphasizing the importance of a 
political solution to the Darfur conflict, Mahmoud said he 
was optimistic about the UN/AU peace talks scheduled to begin 
October 27 in Libya.  He asked that the U.S. pressure the 
Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) non-signatories to attend the 
negotiations.  S/E Natsios reported that he had just returned 
from Zalingei, where he had pressed the Fur to participate in 
the talks. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mahmoud said that his own personal narrative--one 
Fur grandmother and one Zaghawa grandmother, in addition to 
his Taisha tribal Arab roots--illustrated the traditional 
ethnic mingling in Darfur.  Rather than concentrating on 
tribal affiliations, the focus should be on inter-tribal 
dialogue, he suggested, noting that he was making progress in 
"breaking down barriers" through recent reconciliation 
conferences between the feuding Falata, Habaniya, and Salamat 
tribes.  Mahmoud said that the Sudanese Government planned a 
broader reconciliation conference in Darfur near the end of 
October. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Call for Reconstruction and Development 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Noting that he had been the negotiator for the 
economic aspects of the Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement (ESPA), 
Mahmoud underscored the importance of reconstruction and 
development in Darfur to underpin a peace agreement.  He 
thanked the U.S. for its humanitarian assistance programs in 
Darfur and claimed that food aid to the IDPs was "stable" and 
"not a critical situation."  However, he said that Sudan 
still needed support from the international community to 
provide education, social services, health, and housing 
because of the Government's lack of capacity.  Without any 
sense of irony, he noted that Sudan had no money to rebuild 
people's houses in Darfur and asked for American help. 
Mahmoud alleged that there had been a "spontaneous and 
voluntary" return of many IDPs to their homes, and they now 
required basic services. 
 
---------------------------------- 
U.S. Seeks Just, Sustainable Peace 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) S/E Natsios recalled his first visit to Darfur in 
1990 near the end of the previous Fur-Arab war and said that 
the U.S. sought a just settlement to the current crisis to 
avoid future conflicts.  The U.S. was looking forward to the 
Libya talks, where the critical issue would be a cessation of 
hostilities, said S/E Natsios.  He urged Mahmoud--as an 
experienced negotiator--to use his influence to mitigate 
tribal violence in his state and asked that the police ensure 
security for the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the 
people of South Darfur, which has been hindered by frequent 
car-jackings of NGO vehicles.  S/E Natsios also expressed 
concern that some groups opposed the UN-AU Mission in Darfur 
(UNAMID) and requested the governor's help in convincing the 
hold-outs that UNAMID was a neutral force that would bring 
stability. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Rare Moment of Opportunity for U.S.-Sudan Relations 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) CDA Fernandez said that the current period offered 
the potential for an improvement in the U.S.-Sudan bilateral 
relationship.  Sudan could create a "positive environment" 
for this improvement by facilitating humanitarian access and 
the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1769. 
Obstruction of these issues, however, would be a "missed 
opportunity" and lead to a decline in the relationship, 
according to the CDA. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Mahmoud invited S/E Natsios and CDA Fernandez to a 
lavish Ramadan iftar for several hundred guests.  Natsios 
 
KHARTOUM 00001539  002 OF 002 
 
 
noted in his remarks that peace agreements like the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and the DPA need to be 
fully implemented and refugees and IDPs able to return home 
if we are really to attain peace in Darfur.  He added that 
the U.S. is willing to be generous in rebuilding Darfur but 
only if there is peace and security and a political 
settlement.  Mahmoud responded that Sudan truly wants a 
better relationship with the U.S.  The Government is sincere 
in wanting to implement UNSCR 1769 but asks the U.S. to 
pressure the rebels at least as much as the Khartoum regime.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) A Darfur native but newcomer to politics in his 
region, Mahmoud represents a qualitative improvement over his 
predecessor.  Whether his remarks represent anything more 
than a cosmetic "charm offensive" by the regime's more 
polished figures will be borne out by the facts on the ground 
on issues like UNAMID and a cease-fire.  End comment. 
 
¶8. (U) S/E Natsios cleared this message.
