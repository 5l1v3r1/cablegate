HEALTH ORGANIZATION INTER-GOVERNMENTAL WORKING GROUP MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 187542 
 
¶1. (sbu) Econcouns delivered reftel points on countering 
World Health Organization (WHO) Secretariat forays into 
intellectual property issues to Department of Interational 
Trade Intellectual Property Director Doug George and Senior 
Trade Policy Advisor Julie Boisvert.  George had little 
immediate comment except to say that Canada shared the USG's 
view that the WHO Secretariat should stay within its 
technical competence on trade and intellectual property 
matters.  George added that Canada is cautious about taking 
actions that might undermine existing IP agreements and would 
look into what the Secretariat might be doing.  That said, he 
also commented that necessary health research and development 
does not always happen if left to market forces. 
 
¶2. (sbu) George suggested that the U.S. and Canadian missions 
in Geneva coordinate their positions ahead of the WHO 
Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) meeting on December 
4-8.  To help the Canadian delegation prepare, George 
requested more details on specific concerns that the USG 
might have regarding the IGWG.  In the meantime, George said 
he would share the USG points with Canada's Health and 
Industry Ministries, as well as Canada's mission in Geneva.
