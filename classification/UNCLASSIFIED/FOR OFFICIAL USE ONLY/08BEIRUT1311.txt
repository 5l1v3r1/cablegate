REPRESENTATIVES TO DISCUSS IRAQI REFUGEES 
 
REF: BEIRUT 952 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Ambassador, PolOff, ConChief, ConOff, and the 
Department of Homeland Security circuit-ride team leader met 
with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
Representative Stphane Jaquemet and UNHCR Senior Protection 
Officers, Ayaki Ito and Anna Leer on September 4.  The UNHCR 
representatives discussed the current protection climate for 
Iraqi refugees, attempts by the GOL to collect penalties and 
fees from departing refugees, and future case referrals to 
the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).  End Summary. 
 
REFUGEE PROTECTION CLIMATE 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Jaquemet said that conditions in Lebanon for Iraqi 
refugees were improving but were still far from ideal.  He 
noted a recent change by the GOL towards a more genial 
approach to Iraqi refugees, with fewer refugees arrested and 
more released from detention.   He attributed this change in 
attitude, in part, to increased USG engagement on the issue. 
He lauded USG efforts to resettle more Iraqis to the U.S. and 
suggested that increased efforts to resettle Iraqis were 
assuaging GOL fears that the number of refugees would 
continue to grow and eventually destabilize the country. 
 
¶3. (SBU) While Jaquemet was sanguine about the improving 
protection climate at the ground level, he expressed concern 
over a lack of clarity by GOL leaders on policy regarding 
Iraqi refugees and said the GOL had not made important 
decisions regarding the status of refugees going forward.  He 
specifically cited the GOL,s inability to reach a decision 
on whether to continue a policy of granting to Iraqi 
detainees released from detention two three-month temporary 
visas, as opposed to deporting them.  This policy, which is 
scheduled to expire at the end of September, has temporarily 
prevented many Iraqis illegally in Lebanon from being 
deported. 
 
FEES AND PENALTIES FOR REFUGEES 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Jaquemet also discussed the increased attempts by 
Surete Generale, the agency that administers immigration 
controls, to collect fines and penalties from the increased 
numbers of Iraqis resettling to the U.S.  For example, in the 
past only Iraqis without valid Iraqi G-series passports were 
required to acquire a GOL-issued laissez-passer, at the cost 
of $40, in order to depart Lebanon.  According to UNHCR, the 
GOL is now pushing for all Iraqi refugees, including those 
who hold valid G-series passports, to have a GOL-issued 
laissez-passer before departing Lebanon.   The International 
Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC), PRM,s overseas 
processing entity, currently pays for the laissez-passers for 
resettling Iraqis. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The UNHCR representatives also said that Surete 
Generale is systematically imposing penalties on almost every 
Iraqi who is leaving Lebanon for resettlement.  Surete 
Generale is imposing on average a $630 fine for Iraqis who 
entered Lebanon illegally and a $200 fine for Iraqis who 
overstayed on their visa.  Typically the refugees accrue $500 
in fines, penalties and other charges before they are allowed 
to leave Lebanon for resettlement.  Whereas in the past 
Surete Generale would often waive these penalties, the GOL 
has become much more stringent in its application of 
penalties.  UNHCR has helped to pay these penalties for 
underprivileged refugees, but at the expense of diverting 
resources that were allocated for education and other 
critical refugee services. 
 
REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT GOING FORWARD 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) In discussing the timing of upcoming DHS circuit 
 
BEIRUT 00001311  002 OF 002 
 
 
rides to Lebanon, the UNHCR officials were confident that 
they would be able to refer 2,000 Iraqi refugees to the USRAP 
during fiscal-year 2009.  Jaquemet also noted that, contrary 
to his own earlier concerns, UNHCR continues to interview 
refugees that present compelling cases for resettlement. 
Because of the relatively small number of Iraqi refugees in 
Lebanon, Jaquemet had speculated that the number of refugees 
that would meet the high standard for resettlement would 
diminish after the first few DHS circuit rides.  However, 
based on UNHCR,s and the DHS team,s assessment, the number 
of &compelling cases8 has not diminished. 
 
COMMENT 
-------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Ambassador is scheduled to meet with Surete Generale 
Director, Major General Wafiq Jezzini, soon.  She will raise 
the issues of extending the GOL,s policy of granting two 
three-month visas for Iraqi refugees released from detention 
and getting waivers for laissez-passers and penalties for 
Iraqis seeking to resettle.  End comment.
