CONTROVERSY BETWEEN FINANCE MINISTRY AND 
POWER COMPANY LEAD TO SEVERE POWER CUTS 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. (U) It is expected that power outages will be reduced in 
frequency after Finance Minister Azour approved opening $140 million 
Letters of Credit for fuel imports for national power utility 
Electricite du Liban (EDL).  Azour indicated that EDL is using power 
cuts to put pressure on the GOL and Treasury to settle its fuel 
bills as EDL suffers from chronic deficits.  Azour believes poor 
management and maintenance are causing power cuts. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Meanwhile, EDL Chairman Kamal Hayek told us June 12 that 
EDL had to impose severe power cuts that reached four hours in 
Beirut and 9-12 hours in other regions daily as of last week because 
of shortage in fuel and gasoil reserves.  He said he warned Azour in 
writing about the shortage in oil reserves two weeks ago and urged 
the opening of L/Cs for oil imports.  He rejected Azour's public 
statements that increased power rationing was not due to shortage in 
fuel/gasoil, but to problems in production and in programming oil 
imports.  Power cuts are expected to drop starting early next week 
as fuel/gasoil tankers unload in storage tanks. 
 
GAS PRICES REACH RECORD HIGH, 
PUBLIC TRANSPORT FARES ALSO RISE 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The Ministry of Energy and Water raised the prices of 20 
liters of gasoline by slightly over one dollar on June 11, so that 
the price of 95-octane is $21.2 per liter and the price of 98-octane 
is $21.8 per liter.  Private sector economic and business officials, 
as well as member of the labor and agricultural sectors have 
expressed their concerns on the effects of this rise on production 
and how it will affect the most recent increase in the minimum wage. 
 
 
¶4. (U) Even before the most recent hike in gas prices, the Ministry 
of Transportation raised the fares of public transportation (buses 
and shared cabs) by around 33 percent, effective from the first week 
of June. 
 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTE DISCUSSES PLANS 
FOR IPR TRAINING PROGRAM, SEEKS U.S. ASSISTANCE 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) On June 12, Econ staff met with the head of the Financial 
Institute, Lamia Moubayed, to discuss ways Post can assist in 
implementing a one to two year training program at the Institute for 
Customs officers on IPR enforcement.  Working in collaboration with 
the Brand Protection Group (BPG) -- an association of leading local, 
regional, and international manufacturers and distributors aimed at 
combating counterfeiting -- the Financial Institute hopes to use the 
skills and experience of those that post has already sent on IPR 
training, as well as bringing U.S. IPR experts to train local 
officers and improve IPR enforcement.  In addition, Moubayed made a 
strong pitch for a U.S. expert to assist in engineering the program.
