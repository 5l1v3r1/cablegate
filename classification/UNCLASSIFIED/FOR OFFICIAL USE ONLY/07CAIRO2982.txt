 ¶1. (U) Twenty-two independent and opposition newspapers did 
not publish on October 7 in protest of recent government 
actions against press freedom, including the sentencing of 
four editors-in-chief to a year in prison for criticizing 
president Mubarak and senior government officials (ref C), 
and a separate case against the editor-in-chief of the 
independent Al Dustour newspaper for allegedly spreading 
false rumors against President Mubarak (ref A).  Several 
websites, including the Muslim Brotherhood's 
"ikwanonline.com" also suspended activities in support of the 
press publishing boycott.  Government-owned or controlled 
newspapers, on the other hand, loudly criticized the decision 
not to publish, particularly as it fell on a national holiday 
marking the start of Egypt's 1973 war with Israel. 
 
¶2. (U) According to Jamal Fahmi, chief of the Freedom 
Committee at the Egyptian Press Syndicate, "Opting not to go 
to print is a civilized, democratic protest against this 
glaring aggression on the freedom of the press."  Others, 
however, saw the ever-present "foreign hand" behind the 
protests, with the editor of the government-backed Al 
Gomhuria newspaper, Mohamed Ali Ibrahim, claiming in an op-ed 
"...some of these (striking) newspapers rely on American 
funding and other newspapers are funded by the Muslim 
Brotherhood, and therefore have an agenda which is different 
from that of the nation."  Still others see the stoppage in 
the context of wider societal concerns about shrinking 
freedoms. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  Press freedom, once hailed as the 
brightest spot on the limited horizon of Egyptian political 
reform, has taken some hard knocks lately.  Mubarak is 
famously on the record (in 2005 and 2006) as saying he would 
not use his powers as president to act against those who 
"misuse" the freedom of the press, and that no journalist 
would be imprisoned for expressing an opinion. 
Interestingly, those who filed charges in the case against 
the four editors were all members of Mubarak's NDP party. 
While Egypt's press remains robust, it appears that the 
government's line has moved from "no prison for journalists" 
to "journalists must exercise their freedoms responsibly."
