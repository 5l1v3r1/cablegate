¶1.  (SBU) Poloff delivered talking points per Ref A on October 27 to 
the MFA's Supervising Director for Multilateral, Passport and Legal 
Affairs, Kwesi Quartey.  Quartey noted that Ghana was totally 
committed to preventing chemical weapons from reaching the wrong 
hands.  Its failure to pass implementing penal legislation was a 
reflection of bureaucratic inertia, not a lack of political will. 
He said he would urge the Ministry of Science of Technology to 
submit appropriate legislation to parliament. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Quartey further noted that the GOG was hosting an 
all-Africa conference on UNSCR 1540 in two weeks.  This, he said, 
was further evidence of Ghana's commitment to stop chemical weapons 
from spreading.  Quartey could not say whether the GOG had already 
submitted a national plan to the OPCW that contained realistic 
target dates for meeting Article VII obligations but said he would 
check into this and apprise us of his findings.
