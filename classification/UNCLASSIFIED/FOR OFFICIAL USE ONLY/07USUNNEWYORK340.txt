¶1. (SBU) Following last-minute negotiations with the Qatari 
Mission on the draft resolution to renew the mandate of the 
United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), the UN Security 
Council unanimously adopted the text on April 30 as UNSC 
resolution 1755 (2007); text in Paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In consultations immediately preceding the adoption, 
the Qatari delegate raised concerns about the UK-proposed 
addition of language on the Lord's Resistance Army, despite 
the fact that USUN had struck a deal with Qatar on the text 
during the previous 24 hours (refmail).  The Qatari delegate 
delivered an Explanation of Vote before the Council vote on 
the resolution to denounce our original text as having 
"exceeded its intended purpose" by including references to 
the hybrid peacekeeping operation in Darfur and as failing to 
represent the current state of UN-Government of National 
Unity relations. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Begin resolution text: 
 
The Security Council, 
 
Recalling its previous resolutions, in particular resolutions 
1714 (2006) of 6 October 2006, 1709 (2006) of 22 September 
2006, 1706 (2006) of 31 August 2006, 1679 (2006) of 16 May 
2006, 1663 (2006) of 24 March 2006, 1653 of 27 January 2006, 
1627 (2005) of 23 September 2005, and 1590 (2005) of 24 March 
2005, 
 
Recalling also its previous resolutions 1674 (2006) of 28 
April 2006 on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, 
which reaffirms, inter alia, the relevant provisions of the 
United Nations World Summit Outcome document, 1612 (2005) of 
26 July 2005 on children and armed conflict, 1502 (2003) of 
26 August 2003 on the protection of humanitarian and United 
Nations personnel, and 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 on 
women, peace and security, 
 
Reaffirming its commitment to the sovereignty, unity, 
independence, and territorial integrity of the Sudan and to 
the cause of peace, 
 
Welcoming the progress in implementation of elements of the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 9 January 2005, in 
particular overall compliance with the ceasefire this year, 
the progress made in the establishment of the institutional 
framework provided for in the power-sharing protocol, the 
adoption of a budget by the authorities of Southern Sudan and 
introduction of a new currency of the Sudan, 
 
Recalling the commitment of the international community to 
support the Comprehensive Peace Agreement process, including 
through development aid; taking note of the meeting of the 
Sudan Consortium that was held from 19 to 21 March 2007 in 
Khartoum and Juba; and calling upon donors to continue to 
support the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement, 
 
Stressing that elections and force redeployment will be 
important milestones in Comprehensive Peace Agreement 
implementation, that meeting commitments against both in 2007 
will be central to Comprehensive Peace Agreement credibility, 
and that urgent action is needed to accelerate preparations 
for elections, 
 
Calling upon the Government of National Unity and the 
international community to support a successful elections 
process, 
 
Welcoming the first organized returns of internally displaced 
persons from Khartoum to Southern Kordofan and Southern Sudan, 
 
Welcoming the full deployment in Southern Sudan of the United 
Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) in support of the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and acknowledging the 
 
USUN NEW Y 00000340  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
continued commitment by troop-contributing countries in 
support of this mission, 
 
Reiterating its concern over the restrictions and 
bureaucratic impediments placed on UNMIS movements and 
materiel, and the adverse impact such restrictions and 
impediments have on UNMIS' ability to perform its mandate 
effectively and on the ability of the humanitarian community 
to reach affected persons; and calling upon the Government of 
National Unity to abide by its international obligations in 
this regard, as well as those set out in the Status of Forces 
Agreement, 
 
Expressing its grave concern over the continued deterioration 
of the humanitarian situation in Darfur and the impact on the 
region; condemning continued violent attacks on civilians, 
including displaced persons, refugees, women, children, the 
elderly, and humanitarian workers; and reiterating in the 
strongest terms the need for all parties to the conflict in 
Darfur, including non-signatories to the Darfur Peace 
Agreement, to put an end to the violence and atrocities in 
Darfur and the region, 
 
Expressing its concern over the information about the 
treatment following the 19 January 2007 arrests and detention 
of personnel from the United Nations, African Union Mission 
in the Sudan (AMIS), and international non-governmental 
organizations in Nyala, South Darfur; and calling for the 
Government of National Unity to respect its commitment to 
cooperate with the United Nations in the investigation of 
this incident, 
 
Welcoming the communique signed between the United Nations 
and the Government of National Unity in Khartoum on 28 March 
2007, to support, protect and facilitate all humanitarian 
operations in Darfur; and calling for its immediate 
implementation, 
 
Commending the efforts of the African Union for successful 
deployment of AMIS, despite exceptionally difficult 
circumstances, and condemning the recent fatal attacks on 
AMIS, 
 
Expressing full support for the coordinated efforts of United 
Nations and African Union Envoys for Darfur and other leaders 
to broaden support for and move forward implementation of the 
Darfur Peace Agreement, 
 
Noting its concern that armed attacks by Other Armed Groups 
threaten the successful implementation of the Comprehensive 
Peace Agreement; welcoming the agreement between the 
Government of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance Army to extend 
the cessation of hostilities agreement and resume peace talks 
in Juba on 26 April 2007; commending the efforts of United 
Nations Special Envoy Chissano to bring this progress about; 
and calling upon both sides to meet their commitments under 
this process, 
 
Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the 
Sudan dated 17 April 2007 (S/2007/213), 
 
Determining that the situation in the Sudan continues to 
constitute a threat to international peace and security, 
 
¶1. Decides to extend the mandate of UNMIS until 31 October 
2007, with the intention to renew it for further periods; 
 
¶2. Requests the Secretary-General to appoint urgently a new 
Special Representative for the Sudan and to report to the 
Council every three months on the implementation of the 
mandate of UNMIS; 
 
¶3. Calls upon the parties to the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement to accelerate urgently progress on implementing all 
their commitments, in particular to carry out the

the security sector reforms; to re-energize the process of

to complete the full and verified redeployment of forces by 9

North/South borderline, consistent with the Machakos Protocol 
of 20 July 2002; to resolve the Abyei problem and urgently 
establish an administration there; and to take the necessary 
steps to hold national elections according to the agreed time 
frame; 
 
¶4. Calls upon the parties to the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement, the Darfur Peace Agreement, the N'djamena 
Humanitarian Cease-fire Agreement, the October 2006 Eastern 
Sudan Peace Agreement, and the communique signed between the 
United Nations and the Government of National Unity in 
Khartoum on 28 March 2007 to respect their commitments and 
implement fully all aspects of these agreements without 
delay, and calls upon those parties that have not signed the 
Darfur Peace Agreement to do so without delay and not to act 
in any way that would impede the implementation of the 
Agreement; 
 
¶5.    Requests the Secretary-General to continue to take the 
necessary measures to ensure full compliance in UNMIS with 
the United Nations' zero-tolerance policy on sexual 
exploitation and abuse and to keep the Council informed, and 
urges troop-contributing countries to take appropriate 
preventive action including pre-deployment accountability in 
cases of such conduct involving their personnel; 
 
¶6.  Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.
