SUBJECT:  THREE-DAY PRESIDENTIAL JUNKET IN TURKMENISTAN'S OUTBACK 
SHOWS OFF PROGRESS 
 
¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified. Not for Internet publication. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  In the course of a well publicized three day 
program beginning March 4, President Berdimuhamedov and a procession 
of government and diplomatic representatives traveled around Mary 
and Lebap Provinces to attend a military exercise and cut ribbons on 
new schools, kindergartens, mosques, medical centers and conference 
facilities.  The trip culminated in an Elders' Council session 
convened in a newly-constructed, palatial conference center in 
Turkmenabat.  French firm Bouygues representatives took the 
opportunity as well to promote their proposal for car race tracks 
across the country.  The junket appears largely to have been an 
effort to show the international community -- and the population -- 
the progress the state has made in its socioeconomic development 
goals.  Steeped in former President Niyazov's tradition of 
over-promoting presidential benevolence, however, those present at 
the events could well have concluded that there was more pomp and 
circumstance than substance to the program.  END SUMMARY. 
 
NEW MARY, OLD ARMY 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  On March 4, President Berdimuhamedov traveled to Mary 
city, followed by a charter plane loaded with the diplomatic corps 
and a bevy of government officials, where he cut the ribbon for a 
new airport terminal.  The Turkish construction company Efor built 
the $5 million terminal, which is capable of handling up to 300 
passengers an hour.  (NOTE:  The latest Turkmen Air flight schedule 
indicates the airport currently handles only two flights a day.  END 
NOTE.)  The cortege then traveled by MI-8 helicopter about 250 km 
south to Chemenabat, very near the Afghan border, a military 
training area where the Ministry of Defense presented 
"GUNORTA-2009," a well-choreographed demonstration of Turkmenistan's 
military fire power.  Afterward, the VIPs returned to Mary city, 
where numerous freshly-completed construction projects were 
officially commissioned. 
 
MARY APPRECIATION AND PRESIDENTIAL RACING 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  In Mary city, Berdimuhamedov inaugurated a modern school 
equipped with multimedia technology that will host 600 students.  He 
cut the ribbon on a new maternal care center called Ene Mahri 
(Mother's Tenderness).  During the ceremony, provincial leaders 
presented an Ahal-Teke horse to the President.  Later, the President 
opened a grandiose, newly-built mosque that can host 2,500 
attendees.  The local mufti thanked him for building the mosque, 
which was given the name "Gurbanguly Hajji." (NOTE:  "Hajji" is an 
honorary title for Muslims who have made a pilgrimage to Mecca. 
Berdimuhamedov performed the Umrah, or non-compulsory "little 
pilgrimage," shortly after he was inaugurated in 2007.  END NOTE.) 
The next day, Neutralniy Turkmenistan published a picture of the 
mosque, in front of which hung a large portrait of Berdimuhamedov 
wearing a fur hat, with hands raised and cupped in a gesture of 
supplication. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The presidential caravan then headed up the re-paved 
Mary-Turkmenabat highway, to two small dirt race tracks near the 
highway.  French construction company Bouygues' Country Manager, 
Charles Santer, met the cortege, and showed President Berdimuhamedov 
a scale model for a proposed international car racing stadium. 
French race car drivers then demonstrated some racing maneuvers in 
Mitsubishi Evolution 10 and Renault Clio race cars.  After the 
demonstration, Bouygues representatives gave the Mitsubishi 
Evolution 10 racing car to Berdimuhamedov.  The President took the 
car for a test drive, racing up the Mary-Turkmenabat highway at 
speeds approaching -or exceeding- 150mph.  Two French drivers 
reportedly raced along side the President.  The "race" ended at the 
city gate south of Turkmenabat near the Amu-Darya River.  Upon 
arrival into Turkmenabat city, the ribbon cuttings resumed, and 
Berdimuhamedov officially opened the new Rukhyet (cultural) Palace, 
where the Elders' Council convened the following day.  Fireworks (in

RIBBONS AND GIFTS IN TURKMENABAT 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  On March 6, the President spoke at the inaugural session 
of the Council of elders.  The forum focused on rural and 
agricultural sector development, but also touched on the drug 
problem in Turkmenistan as well as on the negative effect of the 
global economic crisis on the Turkmen economy - two topics which had 
pretty much been avoided in local media until Berdimuhamedov's 
speech.  Berdimuhamedov left the council after the opening session 
and commissioned a new maternity and children's hospital.  He then 
presented 30 new UAZ ambulances to Lebap health care personnel, as 
"gifts from the President."  He also opened a kindergarten and 
school recently built in the center of the city.  New Case Magnum 
255 tractors, PAZ buses and UAZ vehicles were then presented as 
gifts to the province from the President.  Finally, the President 
hosted a sacrificial meal for the scores of government and 
diplomatic representatives who had accompanied him on this trip, 
before returning to Ashgabat by helicopter.  The rest of the 
procession then headed back to the capital by charter flight. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Local staff report that the tradition of publicizing the 
opening of new facilities, the presentation of needed equipment or 
vehicles as gifts "on behalf of the President," and the presentation 
in turn of gifts from local leaders to the President all date from 
the Niyazov period, and added a bizarre tone to this events.  The 
decision to name the new mosque in Mary "Gurbanguly Hajji" also gave 
them an eery sense of dj` vu, given the gargantuan mosque in Geok 
Depe's similar naming of "Saparmurat Hajji." 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  This type of junket is typical in Turkmenistan, 
and the diplomatic corps has become used to being rallied for such 
events, although they rarely stretch over three days.  Steeped in 
former President Niyazov's tradition of over promoting presidential 
benevolence, however, these events seemed more about pomp and 
circumstance than about recognition of worthwhile achievements in 
social development.  END COMMENT.
