SUBJECT: CZECHS DO NOT PLAN TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISTINCT 
ENTITY TRUST FUND IN 2007 
 
REF: STATE 17022 
 
¶1. (SBU) Czech MFA Director of the UN Department Jan Kara 
informed Poloff on February 14 that the Czechs do not/not 
plan to donate to the Distinct Entity Trust Fund. Kara 
explained that the Czechs have heard nothing from the UN 
Secretariat since they donated to the Fund in 2004 or 2005, 
 
SIPDIS 
and did not know the Fund was nearly depleted. Therefore, the 
Czechs did not include funds for a supplemental donation in 
their FY07 budget plan. He noted, however, that the Czechs do 
plan to contribute to the UN Democracy and Peacekeeping Funds 
in 2007. Kara was disappointed that the Secretariat failed to 
keep donors -- or at least the Czechs -- informed about the 
Fund. He only learned about the Fund's status when he was 
approached recently by the British Embassy (he gave the same 
answer to the Brits.) He also said he was surprised to learn 
that UNAMI does not intend to rely on the Czech police 
"standing by" to contribute to the mission. 
 
¶2. (SBU) For future planning purposes, Kara said the Czech 
government needs to receive funding requests at least six 
months prior to the start of the fiscal year (in this case, 
early summer 2006). At this late date, Kara said obtaining 
parliamentary authority to donate to the Fund would be 
"complicated, although not impossible -- there are always 
exceptions." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment. If Washington chooses to ask the Czechs 
again at a high level and in coordination with the UN, money 
for a donation to the Fund may be found. However, approval is 
far from certain given the current Czech government budget 
deficit, and could also affect the Czechs' ability to provide 
funds for other pressing needs. End comment.
