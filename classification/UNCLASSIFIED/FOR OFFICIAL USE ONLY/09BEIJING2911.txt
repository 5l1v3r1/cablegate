SUBJECT: PRC PROPOSES U.S.-PRC MEKONG DIALOGUE 
 
REF: STATE 94920 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  In recognition of increased U.S. 
engagement with Lower Mekong countries and China's ongoing 
development assistance to the region, China proposes an 
annual Mekong Dialogue within the Strategic and Economic 
Dialogue framework to coordinate development priorities and 
projects.  The MFA suggests Deputy Director General-level 
talks, similar to the PRC-Japan Mekong Dialogue, but is 
flexible on the rank of interlocutors.  Our MFA interlocutor 
confirmed that the PRC works through the Asia Development 
Bank's Greater Mekong Sub-Region Initiative and the Mekong 
River Commission to improve trade flows and raise living 
standards in the region.  End summary. 
 
CHINESE ENGAGEMENT IN LOWER MEKONG SUB-REGION 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) China had a long and tangible record of cooperation 
with the Lower Mekong sub-region, MFA International 
Organizations and Conferences Department 4th Division 
Director Huang Yiyang told PolOff October 20.  Huang 
explained that China favored initiating infrastructure 
projects that would improve connectivity, ease the flow of 
trade, and enhance living standards in the sub-region. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Huang said that China channeled its cooperation with 
the sub-region through two primary organizations, the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB)-organized Greater Mekong Sub-Region 
(GMS) Initiative and the Mekong River Commission.  The GMS -- 
comprising Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam and the 
PRC -- was the most mature sub-regional organization, 
according to Huang, and also the organization on which China 
placed the greatest emphasis.  China's contributions to the 
GMS focused on nine priority areas:  transportation, energy, 
telecommunications, environmental protection, agriculture, 
human resource development, trade facilitation, investment, 
and tourism promotion. 
 
¶4. (SBU) China also participated in the Mekong River 
Commission (MRC) -- composed of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and 
Vietnam, with the PRC and Burma as dialogue partners -- which 
focused on joint management of shared water resources, Huang 
said.  The PRC sought to improve resource management of the 
Mekong River through field visits to Chinese hydropower sites 
and provision of upstream hydrological information to MRC 
partners. 
 
PRC-JAPAN MEKONG DIALOGUE AS A MODEL 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) Japan in 2008 had proposed to the PRC an annual 
policy dialogue at the Deputy Director General-level to 
identify areas for coordination of development projects in 
the Lower Mekong sub-region, according to Huang.  China and 
Japan had shared development priorities in the sub-region at 
the first PRC-Japan Mekong Dialogue, held in May 2008.  At 
the second Dialogue, held in June, China had proposed areas 
for PRC-Japan development cooperation in the sub-region, and 
plans were under way for the third Dialogue, Huang said. 
 
PRC PROPOSAL FOR U.S.-PRC MEKONG DIALOGUE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) In recognition of the increasing U.S. role in the 
lower Mekong sub-region, Huang said, China was seeking an 
annual bilateral dialogue with the United States, similar to 
the PRC-Japan Mekong Dialogue, to coordinate U.S. and PRC 
development priorities and projects.  Huang emphasized that 
China welcomed the recent increase in U.S. engagement with 
the Lower Mekong sub-region, stating that such engagement 
would advance Chinese and U.S. shared interests in the 
sub-region's development.  Huang proposed an annual bilateral 
dialogue at the Deputy Director General level -- either on 
the margins of existing multilateral fora or as a stand-alone 
meeting -- and within the existing Strategic and Economic 
Dialogue framework.  China was flexible on the frequency of 
meetings and rank of interlocutors, Huang said.
