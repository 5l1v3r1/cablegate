¶2. (SBU) The GOI held an inter-ministerial meeting on January 24 to 
both finalize the delegation and discuss MEMII agenda items. 
According to Ms. Katili (MOE), the GOI is comfortable with all the 
agenda items.  She noted that on mid-term and long-term mitigation 
goals, Indonesia's National Action Plan for Addressing Climate 
Change, released in November 2007, would form the basis for its 
actions and positions.  The GOI, she said, views the Montreal 
Protocol as a good model for incentive-based mitigation efforts. 
Katili also emphasized strong interest in technology development and 
transfer, noting that the MENR is particularly interested in clean 
technology for coal-powered plants in Indonesia. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Katili stated that the GOI is not yet prepared to express 
its position on financing and tariff and non-tariff barriers; the 
delegation would be in "listening mode" during MEMII on this 
subject.  Regarding forestry, she said that the GOI is seeking 
support for pilot projects for its Reduced Emissions from 
Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) initiative.  Dr. Yetty Rusli 
(Dephut) echoed this point in a separate meeting, and emphasized her 
ministry's continued focus on carbon market mechanisms to reduce 
deforestation and provide incentives for protecting forested areas. 
Rusli also confirmed her interest in discussing potential forestry 
issues that the Major Economies Process can address, perhaps as a 
separate experts' meeting during the next MEM in Paris, with 
Canadian -- and other Major Economy - counterparts.  She requests 
U.S. assistance with facilitating these discussions on the sidelines 
of MEMII.
