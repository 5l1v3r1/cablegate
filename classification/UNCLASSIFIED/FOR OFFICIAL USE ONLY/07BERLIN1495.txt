SUBJECT: GERMANY - STATUS OF NUCLEAR TERRORISM CONVENTION 
 
REF: STATE 102149 
 
(SBU) Germany was one of the first countries to sign the 
International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of 
Nuclear Terrorism, on September 15, 2005.  According to MFA 
counterterrorism desk officer Anke Reiffenstuehl, the 
Bundestag (lower house of the German federal parliament) 
passed ratification legislation and implementing legislation 
on July 5, 2007.  Both measures now move to the Bundesrat 
(parliament's upper house) for consideration in September. 
German officials hope to deposit the instrument of 
ratification by the end of 2007.  Reiffenstuehl noted Germany 
has already ratified the other 12 UN counterterrorism 
conventions.
