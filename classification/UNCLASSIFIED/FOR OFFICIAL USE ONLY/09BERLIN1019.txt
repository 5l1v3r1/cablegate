REF: STATE 82753 
 
¶1.  (SBU) PolOff shared reftel information note and talking 
points regarding the 2009 G-8 BMENA Forum for the Future 
(FfF) with Deputy Head of MFA Division, Union for the 
Mediterranean and BMENA, Andreas Berg, who had already 
received the information note from the Italian Embassy. 
Berg's two main points were that due to the September 27 
German national elections, it is not yet possible to confirm 
the level of German participation in the FfF and that 
education appears to be underrepresented on the agenda for 
these events. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Berg noted that because German Federal 
Parliamentary elections take place 27 September -- which 
could well result in a new foreign minister -- it is not yet 
possible to confirm whether Germany will participate in the 
FfF at the ministerial level.  He also was not able to 
confirm who will be attending the workshops.  Berg expects 
that if Germany's Foreign Minister is unable to attend, the 
MFA will try to send a state secretary.  Berg asked whether 
Secretary Clinton will be attending the FfF and Poloff 
responded per reftel. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Berg said that he was heartened to learn from 
reftel talking points that the USG also views education as a 
key area for making progress.  He expressed concern that 
education was not covered in the information note.  Berg 
noted that he sent the information note to other relevant 
government ministries and that he received a strong reaction 
from the Ministry of Education that education should be 
included.  He suggested that an education component be added 
to the workshop on human development and human security. 
Noting that planning for the workshops appears to be in the 
early stages, Berg assessed that it should not be difficult 
to amend the workshop description to include education.
