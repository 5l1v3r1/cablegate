SUBJECT: COSTA RICA: 63RD UNGA HIGH-LEVEL ATTENDANCE AND 
REQUESTS FOR MEETINGS 
 
REF: STATE 72078 
 
¶1. (SBU) In response to reftel, we confirmed with the MFA 
that the Costa Rican delegation to the UNGA will include 
President Oscar Arias and FonMin Bruno Stagno. The two 
dignitaries will be attending a summit in Brazil and then 
will arrive in New York on Sept. 21 or 22 (still tentative). 
The rest of the delegation, the MFA tells us, will be 
finalized about a week before the UNGA. See formatted 
response, as requested, in paragraph 4 below. 
 
¶2. (SBU) At this time, we see no need for a bilateral with S, 
given the likely press of other higher-priority WHA business 
on her schedule.  However, Costa Rica should be included in 
relevant group meetings.  For example, if there is a group 
meeting on the Merida initiative, we would expect the GOCR to 
be included. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We anticipate that Costa Rica would want to be 
included on any broader Security Council meetings/briefings 
with S or other key officials.  The GOCR sees itself as a 
full partner and active member of the Council, and will not 
want to be overlooked.  Additionally, if there are Security 
Council or other issues of major importance on our end that 
involve Costa Rica, a meeting between A/S Shannon and Stagno 
would surely be welcome by the MFA.
