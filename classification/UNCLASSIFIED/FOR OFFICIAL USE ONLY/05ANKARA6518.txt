¶1. (SBU) On 31 October 2005, POLCOUNS and POLOFF delivered to 
Turkish MFA Acting Director General for Middle Eastern 
Affairs Ambassador Aydin Evirgen reftel demarches.  Evirgen 
responded by saying, "we share the same views on 
Ahmadi-Nejad's statement" and that it was "completely 
unacceptable."  He also informed us that FM/DPM Gul will be 
delivering a public statement on this issue at a press 
conference on 1 November 2005 at 9:45 AM (Ankara time). 
Evirgen said that Gul's statement would provide a "tougher 
message" than Turkish authorities have delivered to date. 
 
¶2. (U) Turkish reactions to date have consisted of: 
 
-- Prime Minister Erdogan responding to a question at an 
October 27 London press conference at which he called on 
Ahmadi-Nejad to display political moderation; and 
 
-- MFA spokesmen Namik Tan's response to a question on 
October 28th when he stated that the MFA did not have the 
full text of the remarks, but added that it was "not possible 
to approve" of Ahmadi-Nejad's statement.  He stated that 
"Turkey continues to pursue relations with all countries in 
the region based on...mutual respect and cooperation and 
believes that the conflicts in the region can only be 
resolved through dialogue and peaceful methods based on 
international legitimacy."
