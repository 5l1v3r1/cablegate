(SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel points encouraging Spain to 
condemn publicly recent terrorism and hostage taking in Iraq 
on August 5 to Ignacio de Cartagena, Chief of Staff to the 
Deputy Director of Middle Eastern Affairs at the Spanish 
Foreign Ministry.  De Cartagena is covering for the 
leadership in the MFA on Middle East/Iraq issues during the 
summer holiday period.  De Cartagena told us in general terms 
that Spain condemns terrorism and terrorist tactics 
everywhere.  He also acknowledged that public executions and 
murder in Iraq were a threat to the reconstruction and 
democracy building.  Offering no further substantive 
comments, de Cartagena told poloff that he would convey our 
points to more senior leadership.  We intend to continue 
press these points to more senior officials as opportunities 
arise.  We understand A/S Burns may phone FM Moratinos in the 
near future, and suggest he raise this issue if the call 
takes place.
