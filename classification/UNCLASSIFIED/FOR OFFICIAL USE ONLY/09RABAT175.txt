¶1. (SBU) EconOff conveyed reftel points on February 26 to 
Abdellaziz Hannaji, the IAEA Technical Liaison of the 
Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water and the Environment (MEMEE). 
 Hannaji appreciated hearing the USG perspective, but noted 
that MEMEE would provide its opinion on the feasibility of 
nuclear fuel access proposals to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Cooperation (MFAC), the lead Government of 
Morocco (GOM) agency for IAEA political affairs, only if 
requested.  Due to the illness of the lead MFAC contact for 
IAEA issues, Poloff delivered reftel points to MFA Head of 
United Nations Division Azzedine Farhane (currently traveling 
outside of Morocco) by telephone on February 27.  Farhane 
suggested that the best way to convey this information to the 
appropriate GOM officials would be for the U.S. Ambassador in 
Vienna to contact the Moroccan Ambassador in Vienna due to 
the close relationship that they share. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: We will follow up with MFAC's IAEA lead 
Bouchaib Eloumni next week, assuming he is back to work. 
However, given the lack of alternative points of engagement 
in Rabat on this issue, and the date of the Board of 
Governors meeting, it may be more productive for Mission 
Vienna to engage the Moroccan delegation there directly.  End 
Comment.
