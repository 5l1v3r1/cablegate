SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) FOLLOWING ARISTIDE'S RESIGNATION AND DEPARTURE 
FROM HAITI, THE HOLY SEE TOLD US THAT THE HAITIAN BISHOPS 
    WERE READY TO WORK ACTIVELY WITH A PROVISIONAL 
ADMINISTRATION TO HELP ENSURE A PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF 
POWER.  THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE IS IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH 
THE HAITIAN BISHOPS AND PAPAL NUNCIO IN PORT-AU-PRINCE, AND 
HAS URGED THEM TO EXERT A CALMING INFLUENCE ON THE 
POPULACE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
BISHOPS READY TO WORK WITH NEW GOVERNMENT 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) THE HOLY SEE'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER PIETRO 
PAROLIN TOLD THE DCM MARCH 4 THAT THE HAITIAN BISHOPS AND 
THE VATICAN NUNCIO WERE READY TO WORK WITH A NEW 
TRANSITIONAL HAITIAN ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE A PEACEFUL 
RESTORATION OF ORDER.  PAROLIN SAID THE PAPAL NUNCIO TO 
HAITI HAD BEEN IN ROME DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE CRISIS BUT 
HAD NOW RETURNED TO PORT-AU-PRINCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO 
HELP FACILITATE THE TRANSITION AND WORK WITH THE BISHOPS TO 
ENCOURAGE CALM AND PATIENCE AMONG THE HAITIAN PEOPLE.  THE 
DFM EXPRESSED INTEREST IN LATEST DEVELOPMENTS ON THE 
GROUND, AND ASKED ABOUT THE NEWS REPORTS ABOUT ARISTIDE'S 
CLAIMS OF BEING FORCED TO RESIGN, WHICH DCM EMPHASIZED HAD 
NO BASIS IN FACT.  PAROLIN VOICED NO REGRET AT ARISTIDE'S 
DEPARTURE, NOTING THAT THE FORMER PRIEST HAD BEEN AN ACTIVE 
PROPONENT OF VOODOO. 
 
------------------------- 
IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO GO 
------------------------- 
 
    ¶3.  (SBU) EVEN BEFORE ARISTIDE'S DEPARTURE, POPE JOHN PAUL 
II HAD APPEALED TO HAITIANS "TO MAKE THE COURAGEOUS 
DECISIONS THEIR COUNTRY REQUIRED," AND HAD URGED THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND AID ORGANIZATIONS TO DO WHAT 
THEY COULD TO AVERT A GREATER CRISIS.  THIS WAS SEEN AS A 
VEILED REFERENCE TO ARISTIDE'S LEAVING POWER.  SINCE 
FEBRUARY 29, THE VATICAN HAS HAD NO OFFICIAL PUBLIC COMMENT 
ON ARISTIDE'S RESIGNATION; HOWEVER, THE VATICAN'S CARIBBEAN 
AFFAIRS DIRECTOR MONSIGNOR GIORGIO LINGUA SAID THAT THE 
HOLY SEE SAW NO OTHER WAY OUT OF THE CRISIS AND THOUGHT THE 
FORMER PRIEST HAD TO GO.  LINGUA SAID MARCH 3 THAT IT WAS 
IMPORTANT THAT AN INTERNATIONAL FORCE QUICKLY RESTORE ORDER 
IN HAITI SO THAT A PEACEFUL GOVERNMENTAL TRANSITION COULD 
TAKE PLACE.  HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT A POLITICAL SOLUTION 
SHOULD NOT BE IMPOSED FROM OUTSIDE.  LINGUA SAID HE SAW 
SEVERAL HOPEFUL SIGNS THAT THE TRANSITION COULD OCCUR 
WITHOUT A BLOOD BATH, POINTING OUT THAT REBEL LEADER GUY 
PHILIPPE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED TO STAND DOWN AND 
ESCHEW POLITICAL POWER IN LINE WITH HIS INITIAL PROMISE 
THAT HIS SOLDIERS WOULD COOPERATE WITH INTERNATIONAL 
FORCES.

CATHOLIC RELIEF AT RISK 
----------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) ROME-BASED MEDIA HAVE REPORTED THAT CATHOLIC CHURCH 
RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING U.S.-BASED CATHOLIC RELIEF 
SERVICES (CRS) HAVE SUFFERED CONSIDERABLE LOSSES OF FOOD 
STOCKS AND VEHICLES BECAUSE OF LOOTING -- WHICH CRS 
OFFICIALS REPORT IS CONTINUING.  DFM PAROLIN NOTED THAT THE 
    HOLY SEE WOULD APPRECIATE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT TO RESTART 
THE RELIEF PIPELINES AND GET THE NEEDED FOOD AND SUPPLIES 
OUT TO THE PEOPLE IN NEED.
