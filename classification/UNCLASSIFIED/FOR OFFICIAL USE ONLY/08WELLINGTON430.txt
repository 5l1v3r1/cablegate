SUBJECT: USTR TPP DISCUSSIONS IN NEW ZEALAND 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  On December 8 to 11, Deputy Assistant U.S. Trade 
Representative Douglas Bell visited Wellington and Auckland in 
preparation for discussions, scheduled for March 2009, concerning 
the expansion of the P-4 trade agreement to include New Zealand 
(among other countries) or into the "Trans-Pacific Partnership" or 
"TPP."  The purpose of Bell's visit was to become more familiar with 
issues and particular industries that are likely to be discussed at 
TPP talks.  Bell met with a wide range of government, business and 
NGO officials who shared information and insights relating to 
agriculture, intellectual property, pharmaceuticals and 
biotechnology.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
Bell's Purpose to Gather Information, Not Negotiate 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Bell explained that his purpose in visiting New Zealand 
was to gather information relating the issues that are likely to 
become matters of negotiation and not to begin negotiations or even 
establish "negotiating markers."  Toward that end, his schedule in 
New Zealand was a four-day program of meetings with government, 
business and NGO officials.  Bell was accompanied by staff from the 
Wellington Embassy and from the Auckland Consulate.  Bell received 
briefings on such matters as agriculture, intellectual property, 
pharmaceuticals and biotechnology in New Zealand -- all areas of 
likely discussion when TPP negotiations begin. 
 
Wellington Meetings 
------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In Wellington, Bell's meetings with NZ government 
officials including representatives from: 
-- The NZ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade; 
-- The NZ Ministry of Health; 
-- The NZ Ministry of Economic Development; 
-- The NZ Treasury; 
-- The NZ Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; 
-- The NZ Food Safety Authority; 
-- The NZ Environment Risk Management Authority; 
-- The NZ Aid for International Development; and 
-- Pharmac (the government entity that manages the national drug 
subsidy program). 
Bell also met with business and NGO representatives in order to 
better understand NZ's pharmaceutical, agricultural and 
horticultural industries. 
 
Auckland Meetings 
----------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In Auckland, Bell met with members of the business 
community, including representatives of the financial, 
pharmaceutical, motion picture and intellectual property sectors. 
Bell also met with the NZ-US Council and with the Business Council 
for Sustainable Development (concerning NZ's efforts to pursue 
economic growth in an environmentally-friendly way). 
Next Steps 
---------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Embassy Wellington will be providing Bell with follow-up 
reports on several subjects relating to his visit.  Mark Sinclair, 
NZ's lead TPP negotiator, plans to visit Washington, DC in February 
2009 to continue preliminary discussions.  Formal pluri-lateral TPP 
discussions are scheduled to commence in March 2009.
