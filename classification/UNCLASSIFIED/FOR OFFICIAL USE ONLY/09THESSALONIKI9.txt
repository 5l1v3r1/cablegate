Following is a summary of last month's major developments in 
Northern Greece: 
 
 
 
 
 
SHARIA LAW OVERRULED BY GREEK COURTS 
 
 
 
¶1.   (SBU) In Komotini, a Muslim woman challenged successfully a 
decision by the local mufti to give custody of two of her four 
children to her husband, reportedly an alcoholic suffering from 
psychological problems.  On February 18, the Greek first 
instance Court of Rhodopi gave the woman custody of all four 
children.  Greek courts generally defer to mufti decisions in 
family and civil matters, but such interventions may become more 
common.  In March 2008, a Rhodopi first instance court 
over-ruled the mufti of Rodopi in an inheritance case.  In 
neighboring Xanthi, a woman filed a lawsuit against the local 
Mufti for giving her former husband custody of her child.  She 
and her husband had signed a private agreement allowing her to 
retain custody of the child. 
 
 
 
OPENING OF TURKISH BANK IN KOMOTINI CREATES CONTROVERSY 
 
 
 
¶2.   (SBU) On February 18, the Turkish Agricultural Bank Ziraat 
opened a new branch in Komotini, Thrace amidst controversy and 
suspicions about its intentions.  The Bank got off to a rocky 
start by sending invitations for the opening event only in 
Turkish and English.  The invitation also bore the Turkish name 
for the city, used during the Ottoman era.  Greek officials 
returned the invitations and did not attend the opening, despite 
receiving corrected invitations faxed just before the event. 
Local media described the incident as a major scandal and 
circulated a number of conspiracy theories.  A rumor the branch 
would employ only Muslims from the area heightened local 
concerns.  Former Muslim MP Ishmael Rodoplou further politicized 
the event by stating that "at last, there will be a bank to help 
poor Muslims."  An MFA official told us he believed the gaffe 
was unintentional, attributable to incompetence, not any 
political agenda.  He noted, however, "Ziraat did not start 
well. If it was looking to be one more bridge that would connect 
the two peoples, it is unlikely it will succeed." 
 
 
 
23,847 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARRESTED IN WESTERN MACEDONIA IN 2008 
 
 
 
¶3.   (SBU) Greek Police announced in February that during 2008 
they arrested 23,847 illegal immigrants in Western Macedonia 
(bordering Macedonia and Albania). Of those, 13,159 were 
arrested in the Prefecture of Kastoria (on the Greek-Albanian 
border.)  In another report, local media claimed that part of 
the Greek-Macedonia border was now a "soft spot" for illegal 
immigration, mainly due to shortage of staff in that area.  In a 
visit by post to the border in December 2008 however, Police 
Director of the border area, Major Pavlos Efthimiadis, stated 
that he faced no operational problems and commented positively 
on the levels of co-operation with neighboring Macedonian 
authorities. 
 
 
 
ANOTHER SUSPICIOUS LAND TRANSFER INVOLVING CHURCH AND STATE 
 
 
 
¶4.   (U) The Thessaloniki Prosecutor ordered a preliminary 
investigation into the transfer of 7.9 acres of land from the 
Prefecture of Thessaloniki to the local Greek Orthodox 
Metropolis.  The transfer took place in 1997, but the Church 
only recently obtained a permit that will allow it to build a 
150-bed care center for the chronically ill on the property. 
Opposition parties called the transaction "illegal" as the plot 
of land lies in what is really, they claim, a forest area. 
Metropolitan Anthimos defended the project in his televised 
Sunday sermon, noting the social welfare needs that the Church 
is called upon to meet.  He also accused critics of the deal, of 
"targeting the Church."  Prefect Panayiotis Psomiadis also spoke 
of the important social contribution the care center can make, 
 
THESSALONI 00000009  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
adding that the decision to "give away" the land was well within 
his authority.  The Church and GoG have been harshly criticized 
over the past year for alleged complicity in illegal land deals 
involving one of Greece's most revered Mt. Athos monasteries, 
Vatopedi (Reftel.) 
 
 
 
GREEK VEHICLE INDUSTRY TURNOVER DROPS SUBSTANTIALLY 
 
 
 
¶5.   (U) In 2008, the Greek Vehicle Industry recorded the lowest 
turnover in the last twenty years, its cycle of work dropping by 
51.6%, to 40.6m (turnover for 2007 stood at 83.9m.)  Losses 
rose to 14.6m, compared to 1m in 2007.  Media report that the 
700 workers are only employed thanks to the assembly of the 
Leopard II tank which is currently being undertaken by the 
Industry.  Media also claim that only participation in the 
construction of the Russian BMP-3 tank can give the Industry a 
new lease of life. 
 
 
 
TRUCK OWNERS BLOCK BORDERS AND PORTS, IN PROTEST OF UNFAIR 
COMPETITION 
 
 
 
¶6.   (U) Truck owners have blocked the borders with neighboring 
Turkey, Bulgaria and Macedonia, as well as Western Greek ports, 
in protest of what they claim are illegal practices by their 
colleagues from the wider Balkan region. They accuse neighboring 
truck owners of transferring goods to and from Greece without 
the necessary permits and other required documents.  The truck 
owners also criticize the authorities for prosecuting them, 
every time they report the presence of illegal immigrants on the 
back of their trucks.  Representatives of chambers have voiced 
concerns that the new mobilization will further hit business, 
already in the midst of a very difficult period. 
 
 
 
NARCOTICS - SEIZURES AND ARRESTS 
 
 
 
¶7.   (U) A Bulgarian couple was arrested by the "Kipi" Customs 
Police (on the Greek-Turkish border) for attempting to smuggle 
into the country 100 packs of heroin, weighing a total of 57.8 
kilos. The couple later claimed they were heading to France. 
Two days later, an Italian national was arrested at the same 
location -"Kipi" Customs Police- for carrying 38 kilos of 
heroin.  Police have indicated to post that they believe there 
was a common source of heroin in the two incidents.  In another 
case, an Albanian national was arrested at the Greek-Albanian 
border for trying to smuggle into Greece a total of 10 kilos of 
heroin, in a Greek-plated car.  Finally, Greek Police have 
arrested four Greek nationals and an Egyptian national, close to 
the Greek-Albanian border.  The five had just received 162.5 
kilos of hashish from Albanian dealers.  As part of ongoing 
cooperation in combating narcotics trafficking, Athens-based DEA 
officials and ConGen Thessaloniki organized anti-narcotics 
seminars for Greek police, customs and financial police in 
Thessaloniki and Kozani on February 19 and 20.
