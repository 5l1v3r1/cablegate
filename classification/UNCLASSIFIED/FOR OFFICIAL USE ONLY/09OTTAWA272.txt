¶1. (SBU) Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) North Asia Deputy Director Karine Asselin told 
poloff on April 6 that Canada agrees with the U.S. on the 
seriousness of the situation after the weekend DPRK missile 
test launch.  Despite the apparent failure of the test, 
Asselin added that Minister Cannon wanted a "quick and 
vigorous" Canadian response.  She said he made a point of 
issuing a strong statement (para two) on Sunday immediately 
after news of the test launch broke.  DFAIT Korea Desk 
Officer Brian Shipley said Canada remains seized with the 
issue at the United Nations, and appreciates the close 
coordination between the U.S. and Canada in New York and 
Seoul on DPRK issues. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin text of Foreign Minister Cannon's statement: 
 
April 5, 2009 
 
The Honourable Lawrence Cannon, Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
today expressed serious concerns regarding North Korea's use 
of a long-range rocket in the attempted launch of a satellite 
on April 5. 
 
"Canada is very concerned by North Korea's decision to launch 
a long-range rocket," said Minister Cannon.  "This 
ill-advised action undermines confidence in North Korea's 
commitment to peace and security." 
 
Although the North Korean government claims that the launch 
was for space development purposes, it was based on military 
technology and will benefit North Korea's ballistic mission 
program.  Such activities are prohibited under United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 1718 (2006). 
 
"Canada calls upon North Korea to comply fully with the 
requirements in UNSCR 1718 and suspend all activities related 
to its ballistic missile program.  The international 
community must also remain vigilant to prevent exports of 
nuclear and missile-related goods and technology to North 
Korea," added Minister Cannon. 
 
In 1998, North Korea attempted to launch a satellite on an 
earlier version on its long-range rocket, but it failed to 
reach orbit.  Another long-range missile was tested in 2006, 
but broke up shortly after launch.  UN Security Council 
resolutions 1695 and 1718 subsequently imposed sanctions 
against North Korea and demanded that it ends its programs 
related to ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. 
 
North Korea's latest action is particularly disappointing, 
given the progress on denuclearization within the Six-Party 
Talks over the last two years.  Rather than taking actions 
that increase regional tensions, North Korea should seek a 
path that will lead to lasting peace on the Korean peninsula 
and major improvements in the lives of the North Korean 
people," Minister Cannon said. 
 
"We strongly urge the North Korean government to live up to 
its stated desire for positive relations with the 
international community to accept the obligations or peaceful 
and responsible behaviour that are incumbent upon it as a 
member of the United Nations."  End text
