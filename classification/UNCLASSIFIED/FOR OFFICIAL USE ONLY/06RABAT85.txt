REF: A: SECSTATE 218921 
 
¶1.  (SBU) As requested reftel, Post offers the following 
information on Moroccan non-governmental organizations that 
provide support or services to the victims and families of 
the Casablanca terrorist attacks on May 16, 2003, or are 
engaged in activities designed to blunt the appeal of 
Islamic extremism.  To our knowledge, there is no central 
office within the Moroccan government (GOM) that is charged 
with interaction with these groups, though we note that 
collaboration exists between them and the GOM.  Post 
recommends that U.S.-based groups interested in working with 
these organizations contact them directly.

Objectives:  To ensure that the lives of those lost in the 
May 16 attacks are never forgotten, the association

form of money, jobs, and scholarships) for the families of 
those who perished and provides psychological support to the 
children of victims. 
 
Type of Support:  The association helped prepare May 16 
commemoration ceremonies in 2004 and 2005.  It also 
organized activities for school- and college-aged 
individuals aimed at sensitizing them to the dangers of 
fundamentalism and promoting the ideals of solidarity and 
mutual assistance in Islam.

receives a monthly salary from the Wali of Casablanca and 
the Wali of Rabat (Interior Ministry).
