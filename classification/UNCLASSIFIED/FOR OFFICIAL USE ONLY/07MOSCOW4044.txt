Â¶1. (SBU) Per reftel instructions, on August 16 we discussed the 
upcoming Information Portal Activity in Garmisch, Germany under the 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT), with 
Alexander Bulychov from the MFA's Department of Security and 
Disarmament Affairs (DVBR).  Bulychov told us he had just discussed 
the Garmisch Activity with DVBR Deputy Director Oleg Rozhkov. 
Bulychov noted that Russia would not be able to fund the attendance 
of two partner nation representatives at Garmisch, noting that GICNT 
did not presuppose additional budget commitments from the parties. 
He also said that Russia had earlier instructed all of its 
diplomatic posts in partner nations to encourage attendance at 
Garmisch.  Based on those demarches, it appeared that Armenia and 
Ukraine were interested and would likely attend.
