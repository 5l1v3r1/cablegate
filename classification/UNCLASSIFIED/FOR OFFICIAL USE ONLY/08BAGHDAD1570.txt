Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) RRTOff met May 15 with Tarik Abdullah Chalabi, General 
Manager of Erbil-based Norwegian oil subsidiary, DNO Iraq AS, to 
discuss DNO's planned Tawke pipeline, completion of which apparently 
awaits the green light from Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) 
authorities, and the quality and pricing of DNO's output from one of 
its two fields in the Kurdistan Region.  DNO is producing 
20,000BBL/day from its Tawke field in Dohuk province, selling off 
5,000-7,000BBL/day of the 23-27 API oil to a local topping plant for 
conversion into kerosene and diesel for local use, and storing the 
rest. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Output from DNO's newer Hewler field, in an area 
administered by Erbil province, is being assessed by laboratories in 
Abu Dhabi, but Chalabi expected the specific gravity of the Hewler 
field to be in the 30s API.  Given increasingly higher international 
oil prices, Chalabi appeared unconcerned over the lower prices that 
DNO's lower quality (Tawke) oil was garnering, arguing that the 
company was satisfied being able to fetch $10-20 below market price, 
and suggested the situation would dramatically improve when the 
Tawke pipeline came on line.  End summary. 
 
 
Pipeline Status 
--------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a May 15 conversation with RRTOff, Norwegian subsidiary 
DNO Iraq AS General Manager Tarik Abdullah Chalabi noted that DNO's 
12-inch, 43-km pipeline from Tawke to the metering station at Faysh 
Khabur (east of Harbur Gate) was nearly complete, but that the 
company was awaiting resolution of "political questions" on the 
hydrocarbon legislation before finalizing the link.  Once complete, 
it will link the Tawke output to the Bayji-Kirkuk national pipeline. 
 Chalabi indicated that DNO was ready to complete the pipeline as 
soon as DNO "gets the green light from the KRG."  Chalabi said he 
expects some resolution in the very near term, citing pressure from 
the "20 companies with PSAs (production sharing agreements)."  He 
offered no detail on where the pipeline actually stops or what 
remains to be connected. 
 
 
Oil Quality 
----------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Chalabi indicated that the quality of DNO's Tawke output is 
between Arab Regular and Arab Heavy; that is, 23 API at the shallow 
point and 25-27 API at the deep point.  The Hewler structure output 
was still being assessed at a laboratory in Abu Dhabi, but was 
believed to be in the 30s API when it would begin producing. 
 
 
Output & Pricing 
---------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) When asked about the May 14 Reuters story reporting 
flagging DNO stock prices linked to DNO's low Iraq earnings (only 
$62/BBL for its Tawke output January to March 2008), Chalabi was 
unconcerned about the lower quality/value of the oil DNO is 
producing from Tawke.  He suggested that things would improve once 
the pipeline was complete, and DNO was able to begin exporting the 
oil to Turkey.  He recognized the ability to produce larger 
quantities of benzene (for instance) from higher API oil, but 
suggested that DNO was not interested in competing at the higher end 
(e.g., jet fuel) at this time.  DNO might ultimately be able to 
realize $106/BBL (compared to the market $126/BBL) for the Tawke 
output, and Chalabi expected the market price to rise to $150/BBL by 
year's end.  His reasoning was that if DNO was able to earn $10-20 
below the prevailing market price, it would still do quite well 
given current and projected prices. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Additionally, DNO's operating and labor costs were 
significantly lower in Iraq than elsewhere in the world.  Chalabi's 
extensive contacts in the hydrocarbon sector have enabled him to 
hire nearly all local labor (engineers and unskilled) on a 50-day on 
and 50-day off work structure.  He has also maintained reserve 
employees ready to step in as others leave and indicated that DNO 
rarely used contractors.  Of the 20,000BBL/day that Tawke is 
producing, DNO is selling 5,000-7,000BBL/day to a local topping 
plant for conversion to kerosene and diesel.  The company was also 
 
BAGHDAD 00001570  002 OF 002 
 
 
constructing its own topping plant in order to produce diesel for 
its own operational use (replacing the need to purchase on the black 
market) and selling the excess. 
 
 
Background and Biographic Notes 
------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Chalabi indicated that DNO Iraq AS was one of three 
subsidiaries of DNO (with others in Yemen and Mozambique).  DNO has 
PSAs for two fields signed in April 2004: Tawke and Hewler 
structures.  The Tawke field (Dohuk) stretches from Batufa to Tawke 
and has 12 wells, all of which are producing to total output of 
about 20,000BBL/day (full capacity was purportedly much higher). 
The Hewler field (in an area administered by Erbil governorate) is 
smaller and drilling is just west of the Great Zab river, and not 
yet producing.  It has two wells; one proven, and the other that is 
still being appraised. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Norwegian Ambassador Mette Ravn (also accredited to Jordan) 
stressed to RRTOffs during a March visit to Erbil that DNO was 
operating as a private company.  Noting that the GON and USG 
positions on hydrocarbons were aligned, she underscored that DNO was 
operating in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq without any particular GON 
sanction. 
 
¶9. (U) Chalabi is one of 12 local staff in DNO's Erbil office, with 
staffing up from three when the company opened in 2004.  He is a 
geophysicist by training with 27 years of experience with INOC, and 
with a significant number of contacts in the industry.  He began 
working for UN/FAO in 2003, focusing on water exploration, and 
joined DNO after the company's PSAs were signed.  Chalabi lives in 
Erbil, and travels to Dohuk two-to-three times per week.
