SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS VETTING INFORMATION FOR SENIOR 
LEADER SEMINAR 
 
REF: KIGALI 83 
 
 ¶1.  The Department of State has reviewed its files and 
finds that as of February 22, 2007, it possesses no 
credible information of gross violations of human rights 
by the security officers below: 
 
NAME:  Ben Balthazar Rutsinga 
CURRRENT ASSIGNMENT:  Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
DATE OF BIRTH:  09/06/54 
GENDER:  Male 
 
NAME:  Mubarakh Muganga 
RANK:  BrigGen 
CURRENT ASSIGNMENT:  Rwandan Defense Forces (RDF) 
DATE OF BIRTH:  06/26/67 
GENDER:  Male 
 
¶2. The Department notes Post's information regarding an 
allegation that Muganga was involved in 
civilian/extrajudicial 
killings and Post's views that this allegation does not come 
from a credible source. In its research, the Department found 
additional references to these allegations, but all appear to 
have been drawn from the same single source.  Because the 
Department has been unable to locate any additional 
information 
that corroborates this single source, and because of concerns 
about the credibility of this source, we do not believe these 
assertions rise to a level of credibility appropriate to the 
Leahy standard. 
 
¶3.  Post is permitted to provide the following statement 
to authorized parties:  Embassy verifies that the 
Department of State possesses no credible information of 
gross violations of human rights by the security officers 
identified in paragraph 1 above, as of this date.  Post 
may cite this cable in response. 
 
¶4.  If in the future post becomes aware of possible human 
rights violations by the individuals listed above, Post 
should inform the Department and not proceed with training.
