SUBJECT:  SUDAN/DARFUR: CFC Meeting in El Fasher 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary and background:  On June 13, the Darfur 
Ceasefire Commission (CFC) met in El Fasher, Darfur, the 
first meeting following the May 5 signing of the Darfur 
Peace Agreement (DPA).  Para 2 presents the notes of Lt. 
 
Col. Lee Manning, the U.S. CFC Observer; para 3 is the 
text of the June 13 press release on the CFC meeting as 
released by the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS). 
AU Special Representative Baba Gana Kingibe chaired the 
meeting, which included the participation of UN Under 
Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations Guehenno 
 
SIPDIS 
and AU Peace and Security Commissioner Djinnit.  The 
meeting included presentations of positions of various 
participants, as well as discussion on assistance to AMIS 
and modalities for a transition to a UN peacekeeping 
operation.  The meeting also focused on the need to 
restore security in Darfur, and for those groups that had 
not yet signed the DPA to do so.  The meeting underscored 
that the CFC covered both the Humanitarian Ceasefire 
Agreement as well as the DPA; non-signatories to the DPA 
participated.  AU SR Kingibe closed by noting that the 
Joint Commission should be inaugurated before the July 1- 
2 AU Summit in Banjul.  End summary and background. 
¶2.  (SBU) Lt. Col. Manning's notes are as follows: 
This was the inaugural meeting of the CFC under the terms 
of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA).  The meeting was 
attended by the HOM, DHOM, FC, DFC, Vice Chairman, 
warring party members, GOS, CFC members, UN members, and 
the press. 
Phase I was a closed meeting attended by the CFC members 
only - no press or outside individuals.  The following 
topics were discussed during this phase of the meeting: 
¶A.  The first topic discussed regarded any assistance 
that can be given to AMIS to help with accomplishing the 
mission.  The modalities for transition of the mission 
from AMIS to the United Nations was discussed.  There 
were no definite solutions to either of these topics. 
¶B.  The DPA (2006) and HCFA (2004) were discussed.  The 
general direction of the discussions was that the goal of 
all agreements was to create a secure environment in 
which NGOs can operate, lessen the tensions between the 
parties of the conflict, and attempt to resolve 
differences within the parties.  The point was made by 
the HOM that by attending the meeting the SLA/Wahid 
representatives and JEM representatives were not 
committing their parties to the provisions of the DPA; 
they were gathering information for the memberships.  The 
process of committing to the provisions of the DPA was 
for politicians and political discussions at the Joint 
Commission level.  The HOM suggested that during CFC 
meetings under the DPA that the SLA/Wahid and JEM 
representatives sit in as observers so as to be aware of 
the current business under discussion and report this to 
their parties. 
¶C.  The SLA/Wahid and JEM representatives (Col. Adul and 
Brig. Gen. Bashar) stated their commitment to the HCFA 
(2004) and the Protocols (2005), but reiterated their 
opposition to the DPA.  The HOM thanked each for their 
support and the support of the factions.  HOM also 
reiterated that this closed meeting was being held in 
order to attempt to solve some of those problems. 
¶D.  Mini Minawi had a statement regarding attacks by 
Chadian rebels against his forces in several 
locations.  But said he was committed to the DPA and the 
processes to follow.  Mini also said that AMIS must take 
steps to protect Darfur and the parties under the DPA. 
Phase II Open Meeting - The open meeting was attended by 
the AMIS personnel, UN, parties, and the press. 
¶A.  The HOM mission gave a short history of the AMIS 
mission in Sudan.  Amb. Gibril spoke and thanked the 
original CFC for its work and requested the new CFC to 
continue the work of peace in Darfur. 
¶B.  HOM conducted a formal handing over of the duties of 
CFC chairman from Amb. Gibril to the FC. 
¶C.  JEM and SLA/Wahid stated that they reject the FC as 
the chairman of the CFC. 
¶D.  The FC urged all CFC members to continue the work. 
He also stated that the CFC would continue to meet both 
as the CFC under the HCFA (2004) and as the new CFC under 
the DPA (2006). 
¶E.  The CFC has not met since the inaugural meeting on 13 
June 06 and is not scheduled to meet again until 19 June 
06 for the first CFC-DPA working meeting.

¶2.  (SBU) Lt. Col. Manning's notes are as follows: 
This was the inaugural meeting of the CFC under the terms 
of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA).  The meeting was 
attended by the HOM, DHOM, FC, DFC, Vice Chairman, 
warring party members, GOS, CFC members, UN members, and 
the press. 
Phase I was a closed meeting attended by the CFC members 
only - no press or outside individuals.  The following 
topics were discussed during this phase of the meeting: 
¶A.  The first topic discussed regarded any assistance 
that can be given to AMIS to help with accomplishing the 
mission.  The modalities for transition of the mission 
from AMIS to the United Nations was discussed.  There 
were no definite solutions to either of these topics. 
¶B.  The DPA (2006) and HCFA (2004) were discussed.  The 
general direction of the discussions was that the goal of 
all agreements was to create a secure environment in 
which NGOs can operate, lessen the tensions between the 
parties of the conflict, and attempt to resolve 
differences within the parties.  The point was made by 
the HOM that by attending the meeting the SLA/Wahid 
representatives and JEM representatives were not 
committing their parties to the provisions of the DPA; 
they were gathering information for the memberships.  The 
process of committing to the provisions of the DPA was 
for politicians and political discussions at the Joint 
Commission level.  The HOM suggested that during CFC 
meetings under the DPA that the SLA/Wahid and JEM 
representatives sit in as observers so as to be aware of 
the current business under discussion and report this to 
their parties. 
¶C.  The SLA/Wahid and JEM representatives (Col. Adul and 
Brig. Gen. Bashar) stated their commitment to the HCFA 
(2004) and the Protocols (2005), but reiterated their 
opposition to the DPA.  The HOM thanked each for their 
support and the support of the factions.  HOM also 
reiterated that this closed meeting was being held in 
order to attempt to solve some of those problems. 
¶D.  Mini Minawi had a statement regarding attacks by 
Chadian rebels against his forces in several 
locations.  But said he was committed to the DPA and the 
processes to follow.  Mini also said that AMIS must take 
steps to protect Darfur and the parties under the DPA. 
Phase II Open Meeting - The open meeting was attended by 
the AMIS personnel, UN, parties, and the press. 
¶A.  The HOM mission gave a short history of the AMIS 
mission in Sudan.  Amb. Gibril spoke and thanked the 
original CFC for its work and requested the new CFC to 
continue the work of peace in Darfur. 
¶B.  HOM conducted a formal handing over of the duties of 
CFC chairman from Amb. Gibril to the FC.

release on the CFC meeting is as follows: 
 
bound by the N'djamena Ceasefire Agreement, the Addis 
Ababa Agreement, and the two Abuja Protocols of 2005, all 
relating to ceasefire arrangements.  Both parties pledged 
their support for all efforts at securing a lasting peace 
in Darfur.

¶1.  (SBU) Summary and background:  On June 13, the Darfur 
Ceasefire Commission (CFC) met in El Fasher, Darfur, the 
first meeting following the May 5 signing of the Darfur 
Peace Agreement (DPA).  Para 2 presents the notes of Lt. 
Col. Lee Manning, the U.S. CFC Observer; para 3 is the 
text of the June 13 press release on the CFC meeting as 
released by the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS). 
AU Special Representative Baba Gana Kingibe chaired the 
meeting, which included the participation of UN Under 
Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations Guehenno 
 
SIPDIS 
and AU Peace and Security Commissioner Djinnit.  The 
meeting included presentations of positions of various 
participants, as well as discussion on assistance to AMIS 
and modalities for a transition to a UN peacekeeping 
operation.  The meeting also focused on the need to 
restore security in Darfur, and for those groups that had 
not yet signed the DPA to do so.  The meeting underscored 
that the CFC covered both the Humanitarian Ceasefire 
Agreement as well as the DPA; non-signatories to the DPA 
participated.  AU SR Kingibe closed by noting that the 
Joint Commission should be inaugurated before the July 1- 
2 AU Summit in Banjul.  End summary and background. 
¶2.  (SBU) Lt. Col. Manning's notes are as follows: 
This was the inaugural meeting of the CFC under the terms 
of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA).  The meeting was 
attended by the HOM, DHOM, FC, DFC, Vice Chairman, 
warring party members, GOS, CFC members, UN members, and 
the press. 
Phase I was a closed meeting attended by the CFC members 
only - no press or outside individuals.  The following 
topics were discussed during this phase of the meeting: 
¶A.  The first topic discussed regarded any assistance 
that can be given to AMIS to help with accomplishing the 
mission.  The modalities for transition of the mission 
from AMIS to the United Nations was discussed.  There 
were no definite solutions to either of these topics. 
¶B.  The DPA (2006) and HCFA (2004) were discussed.  The 
general direction of the discussions was that the goal of 
all agreements was to create a secure environment in 
which NGOs can operate, lessen the tensions between the 
parties of the conflict, and attempt to resolve 
differences within the parties.  The point was made by 
the HOM that by attending the meeting the SLA/Wahid 
representatives and JEM representatives were not 
committing their parties to the provisions of the DPA; 
they were gathering information for the memberships.  The 
process of committing to the provisions of the DPA was 
for politicians and political discussions at the Joint 
Commission level.  The HOM suggested that during CFC 
meetings under the DPA that the SLA/Wahid and JEM 
representatives sit in as observers so as to be aware of 
the current business under discussion and report this to 
their parties. 
¶C.  The SLA/Wahid and JEM representatives (Col. Adul and 
Brig. Gen. Bashar) stated their commitment to the HCFA 
(2004) and the Protocols (2005), but reiterated their 
opposition to the DPA.  The HOM thanked each for their 
support and the support of the factions.  HOM also 
reiterated that this closed meeting was being held in 
order to attempt to solve some of those problems. 
¶D.  Mini Minawi had a statement regarding attacks by 
Chadian rebels against his forces in several 
locations.  But said he was committed to the DPA and the 
processes to follow.  Mini also said that AMIS must take 
steps to protect Darfur and the parties under the DPA. 
Phase II Open Meeting - The open meeting was attended by 
the AMIS personnel, UN, parties, and the press. 
¶A.  The HOM mission gave a short history of the AMIS 
mission in Sudan.  Amb. Gibril spoke and thanked the 
original CFC for its work and requested the new CFC to 
continue the work of peace in Darfur. 
¶B.  HOM conducted a formal handing over of the duties of 
CFC chairman from Amb. Gibril to the FC. 
¶C.  JEM and SLA/Wahid stated that they reject the FC as 
the chairman of the CFC.
