SUBJECT:  Burundian President Visits Sudan 
 
¶1. (U) After the end of the AU Summit, Burundian 
president Pierre Nkurunziza remained for an additional 
three days, January 27-29, to discuss bilateral issues. 
The main result of the visit was the establishment of a 
ministerial-level commission to discuss matters of mutual 
interest, focused on education, trade, industry, finance, 
agriculture, and security.  The first phase of this 
cooperation will be an exchange of Arabic teachers and 
students with the University of Burundi.  In addition to 
meetings with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, 
Nkurunziza also had discussions with Salva Kiir, First 
Vice President and President of Southern Sudan, and Dr. 
Nafie Ali Nafie, Assistant to the President and Deputy 
Chairman for Political Affairs for the National Congress 
Party (NCP). The discussions with Dr. Nafie centered on 
joint cooperation of their respective political parties. 
 
¶2. (U) While current cooperation between Burundi and the 
Sudan is limited, Burundi has deployed troops, mostly 
police, to the AU mission (AMIS) in Darfur.  Both Burundi 
and Sudan are also members several multilateral 
organizations, including COMESA and the Nile Basin 
Initiative.  Sudan has started to focus some attention on 
these two bodies, although there was no direct mention of 
either during the meetings.
