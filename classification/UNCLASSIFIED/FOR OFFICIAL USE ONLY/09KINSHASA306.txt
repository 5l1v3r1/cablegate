End text of communique. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  Discussions about restoring diplomatic relations 
have been on-going since the initial 4+4 meeting in early December 
¶2008.  While this development is extremely welcome, the 
international community should continue to press the two countries 
to carry through with the process.  It is unclear to us what the way 
forward is on the "Nkunda problem."  We fully understand the 
complexities of any extradition process, but the Congolese political 
class remains eager to showcase the former CNDP leader in Kinshasa, 
while the Rwandans undoubtedly see advantages to keeping him in 
their custody.  Despite these relatively minor differences, the 
overall balance in DRC-Rwandan relations is overwhelmingly positive. 
 It is even more so when considering that these two countries have 
until recently supported, tacitly or openly, groups working to 
destabilize each other.  In less than four months, they have not 
only committed to restore diplomatic relations, but have designed 
and carried out a joint military operation to rid the region of many 
of its negative forces.  End Comment.
