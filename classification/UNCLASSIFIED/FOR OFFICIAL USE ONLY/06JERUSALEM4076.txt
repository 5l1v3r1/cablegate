This is a joint message from Consul General Walles, 
Ambassador Jones, and Acting USAID Mission Director Harden. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  We urge the Administration to approach Congress as 
soon as possible to request full funding of the 
Administration's FY 2007 request of USD 75 million for West 
Bank/Gaza ESF.  Even though we have ceased our support to the 
PA government, the U.S. government has continued to support 
the Palestinian people and their aspirations for a two-state 
solution.  To advance these goals, the Secretary approved a 
new strategy in July focused on humanitarian assistance to 
the Palestinian people, specifically in the areas of health, 
education, and food relief, and support for the rule of law, 
democratic reform, and private sector development.  A drastic 
decrease in FY 2007 funding to the level of USD 25 million or 
even no funding, as proposed in the Senate and House, 
respectively, would send a clear signal to the Palestinian 
people that the USG is no longer supporting their 
humanitarian needs and would also mean that the assistance 
strategy approved by the Secretary cannot be fully 
implemented.  We know such a message to the Palestinian 
people is not our intent and, therefore, urge you to reach 
out to Congress and stress the importance of meeting the 
Administration's full request of USD 75 million.  At this 
level, the USG will be able to honor its commitment to meet 
basic human needs, support civil society, and build a more 
robust private sector. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) A USD 50-75 million cut in assistance in FY 2007 
will mean drastic cuts to the provision of U.S. humanitarian 
assistance at a time when the Palestinian people depend on it 
most.  Such a substantial cut in assistance will also send a 
message to other donors that the USG is disengaging, when the 
USG should be at the vanguard of efforts to maintain the 
international coalition in support of the Palestinian people 
even as we hold the PA government responsible for meeting the 
Quartet's three conditions.  Should there be a political 
change on the ground, a reduction in funding or no FY 2007 
funding will greatly impede the U.S. government's ability to 
respond quickly and restart those projects currently 
suspended or to undertake new initiatives in support of new 
political realities.  Importantly, the U.S. government will 
have no additional funding to implement the Agreement on 
Movement and Access and pursue other USG objectives. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Therefore, we urge the Department, the NSC, and 
USAID to impress upon Congress the need to fully fund the 
Administration's request of USD 75 million for West Bank/Gaza 
ESF so that the USG can respond to the current humanitarian 
needs of the Palestinian people and any future developments.
