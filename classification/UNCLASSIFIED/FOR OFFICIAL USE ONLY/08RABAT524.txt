¶1.  (SBU) On June 4, the Ambassador telephoned Minister of 
Social Development, Families, and Solidarity Nouzha Skalli, 
who was traveling, of Morocco's new status as a 
Trafficking-in-Persons (TIP) Tier 2 country.  The Ambassador 
also shared basic recommendations and promised to follow up 
with concrete suggestions that might aid the GOM in returning 
to Tier 1 (Ref B). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) DCM subsequently delivered the 2008 TIP report (Ref 
A) to Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director of 
American Affairs Fouad Yazourh.  Yazourh said Morocco,s 
geographic location makes it a logical transit country for 
trafficking in persons, drugs, extremism, and terrorism. 
However, he asserted that Morocco should not be judged by the 
standards of other countries who are not in the same 
position.  He emphasized Morocco,s respect for victims, 
rights and noted that Morocco faces a dual challenge of 
distinguishing between those who are immigrants and victims, 
and those who are guilty of trafficking persons.  Unlike 
other countries, he said, &The risks are much greater for 
Morocco.8  Yazourh concluded that the GOM looked forward to 
working with the USG on developing regional cooperation and 
transparency in the fight against trafficking in persons.
