REF: STATE 117710 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel demarche encouraging China 
to support an anticipated Russian resolution to create a 
nuclear fuel reserve at Angarsk, Russia, during the November 
26-27 IAEA Board of Governors meeting to Arms Control and 
Disarmament Department Nuclear Division Director Zhang Shen 
on November 19.  Zhang responded that China "generally 
supported" the proposal and "had no difficulty with it." 
Noting that the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) had recently sent 
a letter to the IAEA Director General raising reservations 
about the establishment of the reserve at Angarsk, Zhang 
emphasized that China hoped for "in-depth discussions" at the 
Board of Governors meeting during which "all parties would 
seek consensus" on this issue.
