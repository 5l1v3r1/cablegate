paragraph four. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On August 6, econoff learned from Chairman of the 
Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) General Samir Abdel Maboud 
that a courtesy call by FAA desk officer Leeann Hart on the Egyptian 
Ambassador in Washington was misconstrued on the part of the GOE. 
The Egyptian Ambassador appears to have understood that a general 
discussion of FAA's International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) 
program was a notification by the FAA that the USG plans an IASA in 
Egypt in the near future.  Details of the meeting were forwarded 
back by the Embassy in Washington to the MFA, and then on to the 
Egyptian CAA.  CAA chairman Maboud was angry about what the FAA is 
reported to have told the Egyptian Ambassador; that is, that there 
is concern about the CAA's institutional capacity to oversee 
aviation safety.  Furthermore, the letter notes that the FAA will be 
in direct contact with the GOE about plans for the IASA review.  For 
an informal Embassy translation of the internal GOE letter see para 
¶4. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) We have been told by the regional FAA rep with 
responsibility for Egypt that although Egypt may be in line for an 
IASA review, one is not scheduled at this time. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  Please clarify whether or not FAA plans 
an IASA for Egypt in the near future.  We also request that any 
further communication with the GOE, including notification of a 
pending IASA, go through formal channels to the US Embassy in Cairo, 
rather than directly with the Egyptian Embassy in Washington.

Eng. Mohamed Abdul Monem Al Kordi 
Head of the Central Directorate for the Office of the Minister of 
Aviation 
 
Greetings and Appreciation, 
 
In the framework of cooperation and coordination with your honorable 
Ministry, and following the book of the American Sector number 1637 
dated July 4, I would like to inform you that our Ambassador in 
Washington met with Mrs. LeeAnn Hart, the responsible officer for 
Europe and the Middle East in the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA), where the following was tackled: 
 
¶I. The American officer pointed out that the FAA inspectors 
expressed their concerns about the Egyptian Civil Aviation's 
capability in guaranteeing the technical security for aircrafts 
flying from Egypt to the United Sates. She hopes that the Egyptian 
side would cooperate and facilitate sending an FAA delegation to 
examine the situation, ensure the implementation of the security 
measures stated by the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(ICAO), and correct the deficiencies cooperatively, which allows for 
handling the pitfalls without announcing them publicly. Whereas, a 
single action from the FAA's side in reviewing the procedures 
requires announcing the results of its investigation publicly, that 
will negatively affect the general image even if means of handling 
the problem is agreed on. 
 
II. Regarding this subject matter, the Ambassador asked whether the 
FAA addresses the ICAO or the country whose flights' security are to 
be investigated, and if the subject carries an institutional aspect 
rather than technical. The American official stated that they 
usually contact the country of concern directly. She also said that 
the American inspection team is composed of four technicians, of 
whom a lawyer is specialized in the civil aviation law, who stay for 
five days, to ensure the security of aircrafts flying to the U.S. 
The delegation will write its notes in a comprehensive report which 
includes a joint plan with the Egyptian side. Hart explained that 
the FAA's concern is related to the Egyptian Civil Aviation's 
capability in guaranteeing air security from the institutional 
aspect, which means its regulatory laws and available capabilities, 
that is, not related to EgyptAir as an air courier. 
 
III. The Ambassador asked whether the FAA has contacted the Egyptian 
Authorities in this regard and the American officer mentioned that 
they have already done that with the Egyptian side and they also got 
an initial response. Yet, when it came to the $40,000 investigation 
cost, both parties stumbled. The FAA officer said that the CAA 
should bear it. Hart also added that the FAA representative at the 
American Embassy in Cairo is Kevin Roland and I notified her that I 
will investigate the issue in Cairo. 
 
Please lookup and warn accordingly, 
 
Thank you for your positive cooperation, 
 
Respectfully, 
 
Ambassador 
Dr. Sallama Sahker 
Assistant Minister for American Affairs
