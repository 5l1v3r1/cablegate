SUBJECT: SPAIN: NATIONAL COURT CONVICTS TWENTY FOR 
ASSOCIATION WITH A TERRORIST GROUP 
 
 
 ¶1. (U) The Spanish National Court (Audiencia Nacional) on 
February 27 convicted 20 of 30 suspected Islamist terrorists 
who were arrested in October 2004 (during Spain's so-called 
Operation Nova investigation) on charges of membership in a 
terrorist organization and plotting to destroy the National 
Court.  The Court convicted 18 individuals for membership in 
a terrorist organization and two others for collaborating 
with a terrorist organization.  However, the Court did not 
find sufficient evidence to convict on charges of plotting to 
destroy the National Court with a truck bomb.  The sentences 
ranged from five to 14 years in prison, and the longest was 
handed down to Abdurrahmen Tahiri, also known as Mohamed 
Achraf, whom the tribunal believed to be the group's leader. 
The decision found that Tahiri was obsessed with the idea of 
parking a truck loaded with explosives next to the National 
Court, but there was no evidence indicating that he had 
communicated this plan to other members of the terrorist 
group.  Aside from Tahiri, the principal convicted terrorists 
are, as written in Spanish: Addila Mimon (11 years), 
Abdelkrim Bensmai, Said Afif, Hoari Jera and Mohamed Boukiri 
(10 years each). 
 
¶2. (SBU)  COMMENT: The prominence and importance in Spain of 
the Operation Nova trial was second only to the process to 
try those suspected in the Madrid train bombings of March 11, 
¶2004.  In the wake of the verdicts, some Spanish media 
criticized the inability of the National Court to find enough 
evidence to convict on charges of attempting to blow up the 
National Court, and some have alleged incompetence on the 
part of Spanish law enforcement and the investigative 
magistrates.  We believe rather that Spanish authorities may 
have been understandably over-sensitive to Islamic terror 
threats just months after the March 11 bombings, and may have 
therefore built a case on shaky foundations.  Although the 
Court did not find evidence of a specific plot against it, 
the decision clearly states that the convicted individuals 
formed part of a "cohesive, structured, stable, and permanent 
group under the leadership of Tahiri whose end goal was 
Jihad."  Spanish law enforcement and its judiciary remain 
committed to fighting Islamic extremist terrorism and this 
decision was another victory for the U.S. and its allies in 
the ongoing battle against Islamic extremism.
