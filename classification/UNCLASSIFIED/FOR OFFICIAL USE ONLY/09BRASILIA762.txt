¶1. (SBU) On Friday, June 12, Econ Officer delivered the demarche 
contained in REFTEL to Rubem Barbosa, the Special Advisor for 
International Relations to the Minister of Mines and Energy. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mr. Barbosa stated the Government of Brazil (GOB) is aware 
of IRENA but that the GOB does not plan to join it because Brazil's 
focus is on biofuels and hydro power, both of which are not 
priorities for IRENA. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mr. Barbosa also confirmed that the United Arab Emirates 
has approached Brazil about their ambitions to be the seat of IRENA. 
 While Mr. Barbosa mused that it would be interesting for this to be 
the first major international organization seated in the Middle 
East, he felt that Brazil's intention to not join IRENA meant that 
they would not be involved in the selection of the organization's 
headquarters.
