SUBJECT: USG SUPPORTED EMBEDDED PERSONNEL IN INDONESIA 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: In keeping with Secretary RiceQs 
Transformational Diplomacy objectives, US Embassy Jakarta 
really took stock of our successes in placing USG personnel 
directly into Indonesian government offices.  We are 
pleased to report that we currently have 27 positions 
embedded within key Government of Indonesia (GOI) 
ministries and provincial offices, with 14 more positions 
planned.  These staff members and contractors play a 
critical role in helping Indonesia succeed by building 
capacity within GOI offices.  This is a collective effort 
by all USG agencies to assist GOI in successfully designing 
and implementing reforms that are important to US foreign 
policy efforts.  These staff directly impact reform 
policies and help push all sectors of Indonesian society to 
remain open to the outside world and compete in the global 
climate. END SUMMARY
