Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) Massive unemployment, fear of job loss, government 
intimidation, and arrests combined to produce a meager 
response from workers to a two-day countrywide "stay-away" 
called by ZCTU for September 19 - 20.  In the past week, 
security agents hauled in labor leaders for interrogations, 
arrested organizers for handing out flyers, and visited 
businesses to intimidate workers.  During the stay-away, the 
commercial and industrial areas of Harare and Bulawayo, the 
country's second largest city, were business as usual.  End 
Summary.

Just Not Worth the Risk 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The two-day stay-away (reftel) called by the Zimbabwe 
Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) attracted a meager response 
from workers throughout the country.  Primary reasons for the 
poor showing were the lack of actual workers in the formal 
sector in a time of massive unemployment and reluctance of 
those still working to risk their jobs.  Government 
intimidation and fear also played a part.  During the 
stay-away, the commercial and industrial areas of Harare and 
Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, were business as 
usual.  There were reports that some workers reported to 
their jobs, but did not actually work. 
 
¶3. (U) An economist at the Confederation of Zimbabwe 
Industries (CZI) told us that worker support for the 
stay-away was lacking primarily due to harsh economic 
conditions.  The few Zimbabweans working in formal sector 
were reluctant to participate in any labor action and risked 
losing their jobs.  Additionally, with ongoing widespread 
shortages of basic commodities, many workers depended on the 
free meal they receive at the company cantina as their only 
sustenance.

Police Round-up Leaders and Arrest Organizers 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) reported that 
at least 10 ZCTU officials were arrested and detained before 
the stay-away -- all have since been released.  In addition 
to the ZCTU leaders interrogated in Harare, Gweru, Bulawayo, 
and Masvigo during the past week, police on September 18 
visited the home of ZCTU President Lovemore Matombo to pick 
him up for questioning.  Matombo was not home at the time, so 
police arrested his brother and house staff in order to 
coerce them to reveal his whereabouts.  They have all since 
been released. 
 
¶5. (U) Additionally, three ZCTU organizers arrested on 
September 15 for handing out flyers in the industrial area of 
Harare were released on remand on September 20.  The 
organizers face charges of criminal nuisance under the 
Criminal Act and must report back to court on October 3. 
ZLHR lawyer Rangu Nyamurundira told us that while the 
organizers were not assaulted during arrest, police at Mbare 
 
HARARE 00000869  002 OF 002 
 
 
Police Station in Harare did beat them while they were in 
custody.  Another person arrested along with the organizers 
for merely picking up and reading one of the flyers was also 
released on September 20.

Comment -- Is Labor Still A Player? 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Until recently, the labor movement has been a major 
player in Zimbabwe politics.  The main opposition MDC party 
was born out of the labor movement in late 1999, and many of 
its leaders, including anti-Senate MDC President Morgan 
Tsvangirai, were once leaders of the ZCTU.  However, poor 
 
SIPDIS 
showings in the past several labor actions organized by the 
ZCTU call into question the continued political relevance of 
the labor movement and its importance as a pillar of the 
opposition.  End Comment.
