RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 67444 
 
(SBU) Ireland will likely abstain on the May 25 vote in the 
World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) on the resolution 
proposed by China to have Taiwan participate in the OIE under 
the name, "Taiwan, China," according to Isolde Moylan, 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Director for Asia and 
Oceania, who received reftel demarche on May 18 and who spoke 
again with A/DCM on May 24.  Moylan noted that the German 
Presidency had attempted on May 24 to establish an EU common 
position on the resolution that would have included an 
abstention by Member States and a statement on the 
China-Taiwan relationship.  She added that this effort 
collapsed when a number of Member States made clear that they 
would vote in favor of the resolution as currently worded. 
Moylan observed that Ireland would have preferred an EU 
common position in favor of a resolution with acceptable 
wording, especially after it became apparent that the vote 
could not be postponed.
