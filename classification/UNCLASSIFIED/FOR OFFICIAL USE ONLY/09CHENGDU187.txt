¶1. (SBU) Summary: Visiting USG-funded projects to support 
Tibetan livelihood in NW Yunnan run by the Tibet Poverty 
Alleviation Fund (TPAF), CG and ConGen staff saw successful 
programs that teach engine repair and business skills and 
support craftspeople by connecting them with international 
markets.  Underscoring what we saw, the local Poverty 
Alleviation Office director expressed his strong satisfaction 
with the TPAF programs, while TPAF's country director told us 
the local government hopes to emulate their project to improve 
rural welfare through training in health, hygiene, and 
nutrition.  End Summary. 
 
Training in Tractor Engine Repair and Business Skills 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Shouting over the din of wrenches clanking against 
engine blocks, Shangri-la Poverty Alleviation Office Zhang 
Chunshan told CG August 14 that TPAF's tractor engine repair 
project was useful for Shangri-la (previously known as 
Zhongdian, seat of the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in 
NW Yunnan), and that he hoped the Prefecture's cooperative 
relationship with TPAF would continue.  The project, funded by 
the State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural 
Affairs, currently consists of 28 young Tibetan male trainees 
from six of Shangri-la County's 11 townships.  The trainees are 
learning to repair small engines that can be fitted onto 
tractors or rigged onto the front of small trucks.  Building on 
a previous TPAF motorcycle repair project in Lhasa in the 
Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR), this is TPAF's first project in 
Yunnan, TPAF Country Director Tony Gleason told us.  The program 
offers four-plus months of training in tractor engine repair, 
followed by an official test given by the local labor 
department.  Of the current crew of trainees, 15 will also be 
selected for a follow-on project focused on minivan repair, as 
demand for minivans is growing with Shangri-la's increased 
tourist flow. 
 
¶3. (SBU) For those trainees who show the greatest potential, 
TPAF also offers business training to help establish their new 
tractor engine repair businesses.  The business training 
consists of four phases: how to choose a location for a new 
business, market analysis, establishing a business plan, and 
follow-up training.  TPAF also makes small loans using USAID 
funds to some trainees whose plans show good promise, with 
establishment of a profitable business requiring a loan of only 
8-12,000 RMB (USD 1200-1800).  While Han Chinese often try to 
move into rural areas to compete in the engine repair business, 
they often give up after a Tibetan who has received TPAF 
training establishes a business, as the Tibetan is more welcome 
by locals, Gleason said.  The entire program cost just 320,000 
RMB (just under USD 50,000, of which TPAF contributed about 95 
percent, with the local Poverty Alleviation Office having 
contributed the balance), Gleason said. 
 
Marketing Tibetan Handicrafts, From Rugs to Yak Puppets 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) At TPAF's Dropenling Tibetan handicrafts social 
enterprise, located in Shangri-la's old town, Gleason explained 
that TPAF had recently established the not-for-profit business 
spinoff in Yunnan to provide diversification following a steep 
drop in sales after the 2008 unrest in the TAR (though the 
Yunnan site may become Dropenling's sole presence, as TPAF 
perceives that TAR officials want to shut down the Dropenling 
operation in Lhasa).  Utilizing hundreds of Tibetan craftspeople 
in the TAR who produce traditional Tibetan items ranging from 
hand-knotted rugs to fuzzy yak hand-puppets, Dropenling then 
markets the items through a variety of channels, including its 
storefront presence in Shangri-la, a well-developed web presence 
(www.tibetcraft.com), international sales trips to wholesale 
purchasers, and most recently through sales relationships 
established with museum shops in the United States and Europe. 
 
Improving Rural Health Through Behavior Change 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶5. (SBU) TPAF's health program, which used their own "Behavior 
Change Communication" model, has been so successful that local 
health departments have asked to adopt the program for their own 
use, Gleason said in a discussion following the site visits. 
This train-the-trainer model, begun in 2005, consists of two 
phases.  The first, lasting 7-10 days, brings together three 
individuals from each participating village, usually including a 
village leader, a member of the women's federation, and a doctor 
 
CHENGDU 00000187  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
or member of the county health bureau to learn about health, 
hygiene, and nutrition.  Individuals in these specific roles are 
chosen because they tend to have more credibility in the 
community and make successful trainers.  The second phase occurs 
three months later, lasting another seven days, during which 
time participants discuss lessons learned since the initial 
training as well as learn additional information.  During 
follow-up, TPAF works with participants to implement what they 
have learned in ways that fit their particular communities, e.g. 
building hygienic greenhouses, or building new latrines, or 
other relevant projects.  Calculating the number of people that 
each trainee has in turned trained, and adding up the number of 
people in those households, TPAF estimates that the program so 
far has over 90,000 direct beneficiaries. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Asked about bilingual issues in dealing with primarily 
Tibetan beneficiaries, Gleason noted the program's brochures are 
currently in Tibetan, as the program started in the TAR.  In 
Yunnan, however, where few Tibetans can read in their native 
language, the brochures are of little use, he said.  TPAF (which 
has no Han Chinese staff) is having trouble, however, 
translating the brochures into Chinese. 
 
¶7. (SBU) A discussion with Gleason on the situation faced by 
International NGOs in the TAR is reported septel.
