ITALIANS AGREE TO LEAD DHI QAR PRT 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) At a February 12 meeting in Nasiriyah, NCT 
Director Bates briefed the PRT initiative to General 
Madeddu, Ambassador de Martino, and key members of the 
Italian Joint Task Force.  Bates asked for their 
participation in opening, leading, and supporting a 
PRT in Dhi Qar Province.  The flexibility of the PRT 
structure, Bates explained, allows it to be 
individually tailored to each province and easily 
integrated with existing programs. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  General Madeddu expressed enthusiasm about 
leading a PRT but cautioned that he must obtain final 
approval from superiors in Italy.  The Italians' 
civilian subject-matter expert team, Madeddu 
continued, will not be complete until early March 
(NOTE: Four are currently on board awaiting arrival of 
team leader.  END NOTE.), and he spoke of a reduction 
of the Italian contingent.  Nonetheless, Maddedu 
expressed confidence that the Italians would be ready 
to proceed soon with a full PRT; Ambassador de Martino 
promised that it would be no later than early April. 
Madeddu readily agreed to accept the pre-positioning 
of an IRMO Provincial Program Manager in early March 
who could begin interaction with the provincial 
government and assist in the establishment of the PRT. 
Ambassador de Martino said that the Italians will 
assign a civilian diplomat as team leader and expect 
him/her to be available in March. 
 
¶4. (SBU) General Madeddu promised logistical support, 
housing, security, and movement support for the PRT. 
He identified the availability of a large logistical 
support staff that would more than adequately meet the 
needs of an operational PRT.  Maddedu said that, 
although the Italians do not engage in daily movements 
to meet Iraqi government officials, he understands 
that the PRT would require such movements, and he 
foresees no problem meeting such a requirement. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Ambassador de Martino reiterated the Italian 
Embassy's desire to work closely with the NCT in 
planning for the establishment of the Dhi Qar PRT, 
noting that he wishes to begin further planning 
immediately.  Ambassador de Martino also asked about 
the possibility of placing an Italian officer on the 
NCT.  Bates responded that the NCT would welcome 
Italian participation on the NCT, which would enhance 
existing coordination through the Ambassador's 
participation in Executive Steering Group meetings.

GOVERNOR WELCOMES ITALIAN/USG INITIATIVE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  In a separate meeting, Bates informed 
Governor Aziz of five Provincial Reconstruction 
Development Committee (PRDC) project approvals for Dhi 
Qar Province totaling $6.9M.  The USG wants to partner 
with the Italian contingent in working with Dhi Qar 
Provincial authorities in order to assist in its 
development efforts, Bates explained.  Bates described 
the PRTs as having increased civilian participation, 
civilian leadership, and a focus on developing and 
sustaining the capabilities of the provincial 
government. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Governor Aziz thanked the USG for its support 
of the southern provinces and said he looks forward to 
Italian-USG cooperation in the PRT.  Aziz praised the 
Italian CF for its reconstruction assistance and spoke 
of the need for greater efforts in Dhi Qar.  The 
infrastructure is "horrendous," he said, citing major 
 
BAGHDAD 00000500  002 OF 002 
 
 
needs in the water, sewage, and electrical systems. 
He complained that northern provinces have received 
more attention and funding from the USG.  Bates 
pointed out that the USG has funded projects totaling 
more than $500M that are complete, currently in 
progress, or planned for Dhi Qar.
