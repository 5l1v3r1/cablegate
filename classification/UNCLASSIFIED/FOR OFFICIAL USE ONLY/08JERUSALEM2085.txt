SUBJECT: JORDAN VALLEY CROSSING RE-OPENED TO PALESTINIAN 
AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS 
 
REF: JERUSALEM 1985 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: The Bardala/Bisan crossing in the Jordan 
Valley was reopened to Palestinian agricultural shipments on 
November 13.  As a result, Palestinian farmers plan to export 
85 percent of their Jordan Valley agricultural exports 
through that crossing.  Israeli settlers have access to the 
crossing 24 hours/day, while Palestinians are limited to five 
hours/day and incur high shipping costs.  End summary. 
 
Exports given limited access to crossing 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Bardala/Bisan crossing in the northern West 
Bank was re-opened to Palestinian agricultural exports on 
November 13, following its closure to such shipments on 
October 1, according to Palestinian farmers and USAID 
contractors.  Roughly 85 percent of Palestinian agricultural 
exports from the Jordan Valley should pass through 
Bardala/Bisan this season, according to farmers. 
 
Israeli settlers enjoy lower shipping costs 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Palestinian farmers have access to the crossing 
Sunday through Thursday, 1100-1700 hours, and must use the 
back-to-back transfer method at the border.  This involves 
two trucks for each shipment -- one for the West Bank side 
and another for Israel -- increasing Palestinian farmers' 
shipping costs.  Palestinian exports are also subjected to 
GOI inspections with sniffing dogs.  Israeli settlers in the 
Jordan Valley are able to use the crossing 24 hours/day, 
seven days a week, driving straight through the crossing 
without inspection. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  The GOI's decision to re-open the 
crossing, even for limited hours, for Palestinian exports is 
a direct result of USAID engagement -- and that of their 
contractors -- at the local level.  End comment.
