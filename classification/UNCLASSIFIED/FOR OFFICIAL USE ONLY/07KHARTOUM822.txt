Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Cease-fire Commission (CFC) did not meet on May 14. 
During the May 16 meeting of the Second Chamber, the Justice and 
Equality Movement (JEM) sparred with the Deputy Force Commander over 
access to helicopters and the restructuring of the African Union 
Mission in Sudan (AMIS) into three sectors.  Discussions in the 
First Chamber concentrated on the investigation of the April 1 
attack on AMIS forces in Umm Barru.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) There were no meetings on May 14.  Meetings were held May 
¶16.  On that day, Deputy Force Commander (DFC) Ephrem Rurangwa 
introduced Brigadier General Pierre Roques as the new Second Vice 
Chairman and EU Observer to the CFC.  He replaces Brig. Gen. J.G. 
Sintes, who left El Fasher the same day.  Roques will be in this 
position for the next six months.

Second Chamber Meeting 
---------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Col. Abdo of Sudan Liberation Army/Non-signatories Faction 
(SLA/NSF) and Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) representative 
General Bashier attended the meeting.  The DFC remarked that General 
Bashier had been absent from recent CFC meetings.  Bashier accused 
the DFC of bias against JEM.  He claimed that he had been refused a 
helicopter flight back from Abeche, Chad, whereas both Minni Minawi 
and the Sudanese Government representative were granted access to 
the flight.  The DFC replied that he had not been told that Gen. 
Bashier would be absent from the Second Chamber and had not received 
a request for any transportation.  He also convinced Bashier to 
discuss the matter in private after the meeting. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Secretariat presented a table of data on the recent 
spate of carjackings, including the types of vehicles stolen, their 
owners, and the areas from which they were stolen.  Noting the lack 
of any analysis, the DFC ordered the Secretariat to present a more 
comprehensive report at the next meeting.  Bashier said that JEM was 
ready to help if their representatives were notified in a timely 
manner and could intercede.  Col. Abdo also reiterated his 
willingness to help. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Bashier asked the DFC for the status of the letter 
requesting that non-signatory representatives be allowed to return 
to the sectors.  The DFC said that no official written reply had yet 
arrived but that the GOS had informed him that they would not allow 
it.  The DFC asked whether Bashier had received a copy of the 
Communiqu from the Joint Commission, which calls for re-deployment 
of party representatives.  Bashier said that he did not have a 
representative at the Joint Commission, and that the Commission and 
its decisions do not apply to him or his movement.  However, Bashier 
said he understood that AMIS was going to consolidate to three 
sectors, which he considered to be contrary to the Ndjamena 
agreement.  If that was so, he said there was no basis for JEM to 
continue attending Second Chamber meetings. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Deputy Force Commander scolded the Secretariat for 
failing to obtain a report of bombings in Sector 6 that was alleged 
at the last meeting.  (Note: The Secretariat is often unable to 
obtain reports from the sub-sectors.  End note.) 
 
--------------------- 
First Chamber Meeting 
--------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The minutes of the meeting were distributed to the members 
only moments before the meeting started.  The DFC ordered that they 
be distributed earlier to afford members the time to read them.  The 
DFC also distributed a copy of the Joint Communiqu released May 9 
and asked members to read it, but no discussion ensued.  Instead, 
the Chamber again focused on the Umm Barru investigation. 
SLM/Minawi submitted a paper outlining its position.  The SLM/Minawi 
asserted that there had been no justification for the killing of the 
three local Sudanese on April 1, that the report's conclusion of SLM 
involvement was based on false information, and that it contained 
too many errors in analysis.  On these grounds, the SLM/Minawi asked 
that the report be rewritten.  The other CFC members objected to a 
complete rewrite but suggested that the report could be reviewed to 
remove any biased commentary.  S/CRS Poloff will chair the review 
committee, which will report back to the CFC on May 28. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The JEM-Peace Wing representative informed the Chamber that 
the Sudanese Government had begun bombing its people in Deim 
Bishara, and the DFC directed the Secretariat to contact Sector 2 to 
investigate.
