¶1. (SBU) Ministry of Trade (MOT) officials have informed us that 
Trade Minister Al-Sudani is seeking to reorganize his WTO unit and 
"raise its profile" -- a move that he hopes will revitalize the 
unit's work and improve interagency coordination in advancing Iraq's 
WTO accession bid.  The Minister is pressing the Council of 
Ministers (COM) to approve 32 appointments to the new unit (nearly a 
three-fold increase in staff).  These will include not only MOT 
employees, but also representatives seconded from all ministries 
that have legislative drafting or other WTO accession 
responsibilities.  Those representatives would then liaise both with 
their home ministries and with the Shura Council (Constitutional 
Court) and the COM to move legislation and trade regulations forward 
more rapidly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT: Our contacts, including the director of the MOT's 
current WTO unit, are very pleased with this development and believe 
it will facilitate their work.  The COM must still approve the plan, 
but Trade officials do not expect strong opposition.  END COMMENT.
