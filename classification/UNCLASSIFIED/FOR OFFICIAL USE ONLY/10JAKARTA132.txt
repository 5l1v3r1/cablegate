¶1.  (U) Poloff delivered points from ref a demarche 
concerning the Nuclear Security Summit (NSS) and, together 
with Dutch Political Counselor Paul Ymkers, from ref b 
demarche on the Third NSS Sherpa Meeting at a January 29 
meeting with Andy Rachmianto, Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DEPLU) Deputy Director of the Directorate for International 
Security and Disarmament, and Widjaksono Adji of the 
Directorate for International Security and Disarmament. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Rachmianto said that the GOI had previously 
confirmed its February Sherpa Meeting representatives to the 
NSC.  The Indonesian Sherpa is DEPLU DG for Multilateral 
Affairs Amb. Rezlan Ishar Jenie.  Acting Sous Sherpa is Adji, 
as above.  The Indonesian delegation to The Hague will also 
include one member from Indonesia's Nuclear Energy Regulatory 
Agency (BAPETEN) and/or one member from Indonesia's mission 
in Vienna.  Rachmianto added that Indonesia had continued 
engagement on substantive summit issues and had already 
submitted its proposed amendments to the draft communique. 
President Yudhoyono had yet to make up his mind on attending 
the April NSS, but would likely do so in March, depending on 
the results of the Sherpa Meeting and on prospects for other 
leaders attending the NSS. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On a separate issue, Rachmianto said Indonesia was 
still considering whether to ratify the Comprehensive Test 
Ban Treaty (CTBT) in advance of the United States or continue 
with its current plan of ratifying the CTBT shortly after the 
U.S.  Regardless of timing, the GOI continued to work toward 
ratification.  These efforts currently focused on 
"socializing" new members of Parliament to the content and 
importance of the CTBT, so that they would be able to act 
quickly to ratify when the time was right.
