ARREST OF KINGPIN `EL TEO' - EDUARDO TEODORO GARCIA-SIMENTAL  
REF: TIJUANA 1275 
 
¶1. (SBU) Mexican authorities arrested Eduardo Teodoro 
GARCIA-Simental (alias `El Teo') in a residence in La Paz, Baja 
California, Mexico at approximately 0500 hours on 01/12/2010. 
The arrest resulted from a joint operation planned by DEA, U.S. 
Marshal Service, and local authorities, as well as SSP Mexico 
City intelligence and tactical units.  Simental is being 
transported to Mexico City for interview and processing. 
 
 
 
BACKGROUND AND COMMENT: 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Eduardo Teodoro GARCIA-Simental was connected to the 
splintered ARELLANO-Felix (AFO) drug trafficking organization 
(DTO), before challenges for leadership beginning in 2006 led to 
turf wars and ongoing violence in Tijuana and other Baja 
California areas. Since then, El Teo has sought to take over the 
region, and his efforts have been marked by extreme violence, 
mutilation of bodies, pozoles (putting people in acid and 
cooking them in barrels), kidnappings, and the use of 
psychological tactics such as leaving `narco-messages' on 
victims.  El TEO had the backing of Joaquin GUZMAN-Loera and 
Ismael ZAMBADA-Garcia for at least the last year. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) This arrest constitutes a major blow to the DTO that 
has been responsible for the majority of kidnappings and murders 
in Tijuana over the past two years.  Although El Teo's 
organization is losing a ruthless leader,  past history suggests 
that a power struggle will now ensure in which lower-level 
cartel members will vie for the leadership position. Violence is 
likely to continue. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) This will be a major story in the regional media, so 
we expect attention will be focused on the U.S. role in this 
important arrest.  Post EAC will convene this morning to discuss 
implications for the safety of Congen personnel and other 
Amcits, and to determine if changes are needed in the security 
profile of our post.
