¶1. (SBU) Per ref E request, post is transmitting a 
re-classified version of this assessment. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary: This message provides post's input to the 
Trafficking In Persons (TIP) interim assessment.  Paragraphs 
are keyed to ref B para 6A questions.  End Summary. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Question (a): The GOB established a new unit to 
combat human trafficking under the economic crimes unit at 
the Criminal Investigative Directorate.  The Human 
Trafficking Unit (HTU), comprised of two men and eight women, 
appears to view female victims of trafficking for the purpose 
of sexual exploitation as its priority.  The Bahraini 
authorities have welcomed offers of training and 
investigative assistance from the local office of the U.S. 
Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS).  HTU reports 
that it has referred several cases of possible human 
trafficking to the Public Prosecution, which determined that 
only one of these cases met the legal standard set by the 
anti-trafficking law enacted in January 2008.  The HTU has a 
Thai woman in custody who the GOB charged with trafficking 
three other women.  The court will conduct a final hearing in 
the case against the Thai woman on December 23.  The victims 
provided testimony against the suspect to the HTU and Public 
Prosecution, and then were repatriated at their request. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Question (b): The law required the GOB establish two 
committees, one for policy development, headed by the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and one for victim support, 
headed by the Ministry of Social Development.  The Minister 
of Social Development established the victim support 
committee in August.  It has not yet developed a formal 
victim identification procedure.  According to the Public 
Prosecution office, investigators attempt to ascertain if 
migrant workers were forced or coerced into conducting any 
activity, legal or illegal, or had their freedom of movement 
restricted in any way. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Question (c): The three victims mentioned above 
provided written testimony against the defendant, and were 
repatriated at their request. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Question (d): The GOB launched a new migrant labor 
visa regime and spent considerable time and money explaining 
the new system to the public.  The system allows for workers 
to change employers, shifts the responsibility for "runaway" 
workers to employers, and criminalizes the use of so-called 
"free visas," the former technically illegal but widespread 
practice under which a Bahraini sponsors held a worker's visa 
and "allowed" the worker to find their own work and 
accommodations for a fee. The new regime is designed to force 
employers to register their workers.  The changes should end 
some former abuses, but they do not yet apply to domestic 
household workers.  Despite numerous statements from the 
Minister of Labor and from the CEO of the Labor Market 
Regulatory Authority (LMRA) that the practice of holding 
passports is illegal, it remains common.  The Migrant Workers 
Protection Society, an NGO, reported that administrative 
clerks at the courts confirm that the practice was legal. 
Sexual exploitation of any kind is illegal. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Question (d), continued: The HTU produced a flier 
describing the new anti-trafficking law and soliciting 
complaints to its hotline.  The GOB distributes the flier at 
the airport.  The LMRA continued to expand the material 
available on its website, www.lmra.bh, in numerous languages 
to enable migrant workers to know their rights under the new 
system.  The LMRA worked with the International Organization 
for Migration to develop an information brochure for all 
incoming workers.  IOM reports that the brochure is in its 
final draft form.
