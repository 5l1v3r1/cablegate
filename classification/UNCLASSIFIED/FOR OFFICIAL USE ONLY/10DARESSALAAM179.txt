(SBU) PolOff delivered the non-papers concerning Iran 
contained in reftels to MFA Foreign Affairs Officer John 
Kambona on February 23. In response to Iran's decision to 
enrich uranium to twenty percent, Kambona noted that such a 
decision was a "concern for everyone" given the "volatile" 
nature of the region. Kambona expressed great interest in the 
information outlined in ref b and c. He said he would discuss 
the issues related to the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping 
Lines with the relevant port authorities and explore the 
possibility of doing likewise with local insurance companies.
