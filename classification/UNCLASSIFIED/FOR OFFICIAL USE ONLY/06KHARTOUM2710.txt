SUBJECT: Government of Sudan Launches Military 
Operations Against Rebels Outside DPA 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Sudanese armed forces, reinforced by air power 
and allied Arab janjaweed militia, have launched major attacks 
against rebels in the area of Birmaza in North Darfur from late 
October to the present.  UN, AU, NGO, and press accounts report that 
scores of livestock were looted and several villages torched.  The 
incident is the latest in a three- week long offensive across much 
of Darfur aimed at destroying the support infrastructure of 
remaining rebel holdouts to the Darfur Peace Agreement.  The African 
Union characterized the attacks as a flagrant violation of the DPA, 
and has called on all parties to cease and desist.  The action also 
complicates international community efforts to convene a conference 
of non-signatories in the area of Birmaza.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Government of Sudan Armed Forces (SAF), allied with Arab 
janjaweed militia, have initiated offensive operations in an attempt 
to wipe out rebels from the National Redemption Front (NRF) and 
their safe-havens located north and west of a line stretching from 
El Geneina to Kutum.  The October 29 attacks on villages located in 
Jebel Moon appear to have kicked off the offensive.  These attacks 
were followed by an attack on Sirba village on November 11.  Most 
recently, the SAF launched operations against NRF strongholds in 
Birmaza.  These attacks were preceded by softening bombing raids by 
Government aircraft.  SAF have also positioned forces in Jebel 
Marra, likely a deployment presaging future operations.  South 
Darfur has also seen fighting around El Muturwad between Arab and 
non-Arab tribes.  This action, while far removed from the fighting 
in West and North Darfur, nonetheless contributes to overall 
instability in the region. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The first two attacks, characterized by the burning of 
villages and attacks on civilians, appear to have targeted rebel 
supporters.  The latest attack in Birmaza, however, was aimed more 
at NRF rebels themselves, including leadership.  A common thread 
throughout all the attacks is the looting of livestock.  This serves 
to both deny supplies to rebels and their supporters, as well as 
replenish the stores of the Arab militia. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  The recent military offensive underscores the 
Government of Sudan's intention to pursue a military solution to the 
conflict in Darfur.  However, the Embassy is continuing its efforts 
to energize the AU to pressure the Government to halt its offensive 
and allow a conference of non-signatory commanders to go forward. 
End Comment.
