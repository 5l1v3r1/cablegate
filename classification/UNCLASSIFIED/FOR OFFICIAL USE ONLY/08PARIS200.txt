REF: SECSTATE 6989 
 
(SBU) In response to the referenced request to report on the 
status of implementation of the Berlin Declaration in host 
countries, ESTH Officer spoke with Dr. Paula Fujiwara, CDC 
officer on detail to the International Union against 
Tuberculosis and Lung Disease.  Dr. Fujiwara considers that 
little headway has been made since the Declaration and that 
it was likely that the "TB community" would use World TB day, 
March 24, to push countries forward to meet Berlin 
Declaration commitments, as well as brainstorm on how to 
develop an action plan by Autumn 2008.  She noted that with 
France assuming the EU presidency in July 2008 this would 
likely be one of the diplomatic points to push regarding the 
health agenda in Europe.
