ACCUSATIONS 
 
¶1.   (SBU)  On April 27, an African National Congress (ANC) 
victory parade in KwaSwayimane near Pietermaritzburg ended when 
assailants opened fire on the crowd leaving one ANC supporter 
dead and another six injured.  Two IFP supporters have been 
apprehend by police and are being questioned about the attack. 
In Ulundi, an ANC supporter was stoned by IFP supporters, 
alleged ANC spokesperson Nomfundo Mcetshwa to Pol/Econ 
Assistant.  Also, in Paulpietersburg, IFP supporters pointed a 
gun at ANC supporters during an ANC celebration, according to 
political violence monitor Mary de Haas.  de Haas also reported 
that in Mpongolo an ANC supporter was allegedly shot by an IFP 
counselor.   IFP National Organizer Albert Mncwango, speaking to 
the Pol/Econ Assistant, however, cautioned against making 
assumptions about who is responsible for recent events and 
called upon the ANC to desist from linking recent incidents of 
violence to the IFP without any proof.  de Haas pointed out that 
the ANC `can be provocative' and may have deliberately chosen to 
celebrate in traditionally IFP-strong areas.  Senior police 
officials reported to Foreign Service National Investigator, in 
confidence, that authorities are still investigating the motives 
for the attacks and have not ruled out that they are politically 
motivated. 
 
¶2.   (SBU)  Comment.  Since 1994, the IFP has steadily lost 
power and influence in KZN, and many IFP supporters simply 
cannot stand to see the ANC celebrate its victory, especially in 
traditional IFP strongholds.  While IFP and ANC leaders have 
been conciliatory in their post-election remarks, supporters in 
rural areas still seem to be engaged in a decades-old battle 
over control.   IFP supporters may have committed the recent 
violent acts, but the ANC is likely responsible for fueling 
post-election tensions in certain rural areas. End Comment.
