SUBJECT:  DEATH OF MAORI INFANTS BRINGS DEBATE & DISCORD 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The brutal deaths of twin Maori babies who lived in a house 
with several benefit recipients has sparked nationwide debate over 
the actions of the family.  It has also highlighted the growing 
problem of welfare dependency, drug and alcohol addiction and child 
neglect within the Maori community. Even Maori leaders and 
commentators are divided over how best to address the problems 
raised by the case. The Maori Party co-leader has seen his status 
with the public rise as a result of his performance in the wake of 
the tragic deaths. End Summary 
 
The case 
-------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Three-month-old Auckland twins Chris and Cru Kahui died 
after being brought to a hospital suffering brain damage. One of the 
11-week-old infants also had a broken thigh bone. Immediately after 
the deaths, the family was roundly accused of stonewalling police 
investigations by arguing that they needed time to grieve before 
talking to police. Some New Zealanders, both Maori and non-Maori, 
are outraged at what they see as the family hiding behind a 
traditional Maori grieving custom. Almost three weeks after the 
killings, the family still has not revealed to investigators who is 
responsible for the deaths and to date no arrests have been made. 
Police are defending their handling of the investigation, stating 
that they cannot be rushed into a result which will not stand up in 
court. Despite this, some politicians believe that the case needs to 
move forward expeditiously and the next step should be arrests for 
murder and obstruction of justice. 
 
Issues thrown up from case divides Maori body politic 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Although Maori political leadership all agree that the 
family must take responsibility for the deaths, schisms have 
surfaced among them over how best to address the underlying problems 
the case revealed. Urban Maori leader (and former MP) John Tamihere 
argues that Maori social service providers have to contend daily 
with social problems similar to those of the Kahuis. He proposes 
that benefits should be paid to Maori agencies which would then pay 
beneficiaries' essential household bills. Benefits would be cut to 
those refusing services such as family support or addiction 
treatment. Tamihere also accuses Maori Party co-leader, Dr. Pita 
Sharples, of being blind to the "world of urban Maori degradation." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Sharples' fellow party co-leader, Tariana Turia maintains 
that Maori must be involved in welfare decision-making rather than 
others making decisions for them. Alan Duff, a prominent writer on 
urban Maori and an outspoken critic of the "culture of violence" 
within Maoridom, welcomed tighter control of welfare payments but 
believes that Tamihere's proposal is not the answer. Green Party 
Maori issues spokeswoman Metiria Turei labeled the Proposal as a 
ridiculous knee-jerk reaction to an extreme case of beneficiary 
abuse. Prime Minister Helen Clark also dismissed the proposal. 
 
Sharples profile grows in wake of deaths 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) In contrast to the other commentators, Sharples' open 
indignation at the actions of the Kahui family and his efforts to 
address social problems within Maori have broadened his political 
appeal. He has visited with the family and urged their cooperation 
with police.  Sharples has also laid bare his own experiences as an 
abused child. While some have accused him of political profiteering, 
most observers have been very positive about his approach.  One 
journalist said that when he talked about the Kahui case Sharples 
was 'the brown man saying what white people were thinking'. He has 
even been called the 'Kaumatua' (male tribal elder) of the nation. 
Whether Sharples newly elevated appeal translates into a political 
evolution for Maori (or himself) remains to be seen.  But at the 
very least his response has ignited a national debate about the best 
way to deal with Maori social problems.
