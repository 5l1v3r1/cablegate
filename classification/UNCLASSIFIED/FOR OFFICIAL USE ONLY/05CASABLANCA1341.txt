it is actually a RAM representative that identifies a 
passenger bearing a fraudulent US or Moroccan travel 
document and notifies the immigration or police authorities 
at the airport. 
 
After the May 16, 2003, Casablanca bombings, the Moroccan 
Parliament passed a new terrorism law that significantly 
increased the penalties for forgeries and the fraudulent 
production of government and private documents.  The 
punishments are most serious for government documents, such 
as passports, national identification cards, and police and 
educational certificates, with the penalties ranging from a 
minimum six month jail term to 5 years for serious offenses. 
For private documents, punishments range from 6 months to 
two years, depending on the harm done with the fraudulent 
documents.  These crimes and visa fraud are prosecuted by 
the Moroccan authorities, as all individuals referred to the 
police by the FPU were sentenced to at least a six-month 
prison term. 
 
¶I. AREAS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN:  While the fraud associated 
our DV program remains high, the number of suspect and 
actual sham marriages continues to rise on the IV visa line. 
These include inter-family relationships, such as marriage 
to a first cousin.  While this is not prohibited in Morocco 
or in several states in the U.S., the petitioner and 
applicant often have little relationship with one another 
prior to the visa application.  In addition, the number of 
internet marriages continues to rise.  Some of these sham 
marriages are easy to identify, such as when the petitioner 
and applicant do not share a common language.  The FPU would 
appreciate CA assistance in providing guidance on 
Citizenship and Immigration Service (CIS) guidelines for 
prosecuting fraudulent marriages, which would assist in the 
preparation of revocation memos for these petitions. 
 
¶J. STAFFING AND TRAINING:  Currently, the FPU consists of a 
single FSN Fraud Investigator (FI) and an FPM vice consul 
who also serves as the Consular ACO and ACS Chief.  In 
addition to general NIV and ACS training, the FI has 
attended regional fraud prevention courses at Nicosia in 
1996 and at Rome in 1999.  He was scheduled to attend the 
Anti-Fraud Workshop in early 2005 at Abu Dhabi when it was 
cancelled.  The FPM completed the FPM course at FSI in 2005. 
 
Morocco remains in the top five countries worldwide for the 
Diversity Visa entrants.  This appears to be a primary 
reason for a substantial increase in IV petitions filed for 
Moroccan beneficiaries and in relatives seeking NIVs to 
visit American citizens in the U.S.  In addition, the 
Morocco-U.S. Free Trade Agreement will go into effect on 
January 1, 2006, and is likely to have a further impact on 
NIV demand.  As a result, demand for the FSN/I's 
knowledgeable, fraud-related interpretation assistance on 
the visa line is increasingly occupying his time.  In 
addition, due to his experience, he backs up most FSN 
positions in the section.  GREENE
