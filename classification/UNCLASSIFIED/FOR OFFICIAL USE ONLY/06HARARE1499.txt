REF: STATE 175925 
 
¶1. (U) This cable responds to reftel request to update 
information for the 2006 Country Reports on Terrorism. 
 
------------------ 
GENERAL ASSESSMENT 
------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) Zimbabwe does not fit the criteria stipulated in 
paragraph 10 (a) and (b) of reftel instructions.  Despite our 
strained bilateral relationship and the GOZ's self-imposed 
isolation on most diplomatic issues, local intelligence and 
criminal investigative agencies to date have been responsive 
to USG needs and concerns regarding terrorist issues.  At 
Embassy request, these agencies have routinely provided 
assistance by conducting investigative inquiries, traces, and 
border checks of individuals thought to be threats to USG 
facilities or personnel.  The government in 2004 passed the 
Bank Use Promotion and Suppression of Money Laundering Act, 
which addresses terrorist financing and authorizes the 
tracking and seizing of assets, and has since implemented it. 
 In May 2006, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) released new 
guidelines on anti-money laundering and combating the 
financing of terrorism for financial institutions and 
non-financial businesses and professionals.  In August 2006, 
Zimbabwe assumed the Presidency for the Eastern and Southern 
Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) for the 
2006/2007 administrative year.  Zimbabwe, however, has yet to 
become a party to the UN International Convention for the 
Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. 
 
--------------------- 
SAFE HAVEN ASSESSMENT 
--------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Given the country's oppressive and omnipresent 
security and intelligence agencies, the GOZ is 
well-positioned to be aware of any terrorist activities on 
its territory.  There is no credible evidence that Zimbabwe 
is being used as a safe haven or that the GOZ provides 
sanctuary to any international or indigenous terrorist group. 
 The GOZ does, however, maintain diplomatic relations with 
countries identified as being state sponsors of terrorism. 
Cuba, Iran, Libya, and Sudan have embassies in Harare and 
there is an emerging North Korean diplomatic presence. 
Additionally, President Robert Mugabe visited both Cuba and 
Iran in 2006. 
 
------------------------------- 
INFORMATION ON TERRORIST GROUPS 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) No terrorist cells were identified in Zimbabwe by 
the GOZ in 2006 and Post has no reason to believe that any 
are active in the country.  To date, Zimbabwe has not been a 
good operating environment for terrorist groups due to the 
country's aggressive security and intelligence apparatus. 
This operating environment may, however, become more 
appealing to terrorists if the capabilities of these agencies 
continue to be eroded by the country's deteriorating economic 
conditions. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
INFORMATION ON FOREIGN GOVERNMENT COOPERATION 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Although the GOZ has not been requested to cooperate 
in the investigation or prosecution of any terrorist act 
within the past five years, there exist no known impediments 
to host government prosecution and/or extradition of 
suspected terrorists.  Additionally, as noted in paragraph 2, 
Zimbabwe currently holds the Presidency for ESAAMLG and 
hosted the group's Council of Ministers of Finance meeting in 
August.  Also in August, Zimbabwe and Republic of South 
Africa signed a memorandum of understanding for the exchange 
of information in combating money laundering and financing of 
terrorism. 
 
¶6. (U) Post's terrorism reporting officer is Political 
Officer Scott C. Higgins.  His telephone number is (263) (4) 
250-593 ext 321 and email addresses are HigginsSC@state.gov 
(unclassified) and HigginsSC@state.sgov.gov (classified).
