SUBJECT: PRC/MONGOLIA: ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL TIES STILL 
GROWING 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a December 3 meeting with Econoffs, Mongolian 
Commercial and Economic Counselor Nyamtseren Enkhtaivan noted 
that Chinese-Mongolian trade was increasing "quite well," and 
that generally the bilateral relationship had progressed 
quickly over the past 60 years.  For instance, bilateral 
trade had increased 30 to 40 percent each year for the past 
11 years, and was nearly USD 3 billion in 2008, up from USD 
1.4 billion in 2006.  Enkhtaivan predicted the financial 
crisis would decrease trade to about USD 2 billion this year, 
but went on to note that China remained Mongolia's largest 
investor, with 3,000 enterprises and USD 1.3 billion invested 
in mining, infrastructure, light industry, and services. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Enkhtaivan noted that China has provided USD 250 
million in development aid over the past three years and that 
the two countries are still discussing a possible USD 3 
billion commercial loan.  China and Mongolia signed a 
framework agreement on the loan in late 2008, and more 
recently the Mongolians presented a list of 18 projects which 
the loan would finance.  The Chinese government would lend 
the money to the Mongolian government, which would then 
direct financing to businesses.  Although he was unwilling to 
specify the exact projects or their timelines, he said they 
would primarily be in the mining, infrastructure, and energy 
sectors. 
 
¶3. (SBU) When asked about the massive Tavan Tolgoi coal mine 
in the Gobi Desert, which U.S. firm Peabody and others are 
interested in developing, Enkhtaivan noted that he had spoken 
with China's Shenhua Group, which he said had been designated 
by Beijing as the lead Chinese company for the project. 
(Note: Peabody-Beijing has met regularly with Shenhua to 
explore a possible joint venture, although Shenhua reportedly 
prefers operating the project independently or, at a minimum, 
as the lead investor.  Enkhtaivan added that he had met with 
Peabody as well.  End Note.)  Once on the subject of Shenhua, 
he did say that one of the 18 commercial loan projects would 
include Shenhua, though he did not specify the role Shenhua 
would play or if it was tied directly to a Tavan Tolgoi 
conditionality. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Although Enkhtaivan told Econoffs that Chinese 
companies were not interested in mining uranium in Mongolia, 
he did note that China National Uranium Corporation had 
recently bought almost 80 percent of Western Prospector's 
shares.  (Note: Western Prospector was a Canadian-registered 
minerals exploration firm with active U.S. interests--a U.S. 
equity firm continues to own approximately 20 
percent--currently well-established in Mongolia.  End Note.) 
He also said that Mongolia is still in discussions with China 
State Grid regarding development of a 4 GW power complex at 
Shivee Ovoo, also in the Gobi.  Nearly all power produced 
there would be for export into the Chinese market.  He also 
clarified that the railway China had proposed to build from 
its border with Mongolia would run to the Nariin Sukhait coal 
mine, about 60 kilometers from the border.  He noted 
construction would begin in 2010, and that the two countries 
continued to hold budget discussions on the project. 
 
¶5. This cable was written in conjunction with Embassy 
Ulaanbaatar, whose Econoff was TDY in Beijing and 
participated in this meeting.
