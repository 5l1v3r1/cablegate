¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: During Ambassador's March 16 courtesy call, 
Minister of Tourism Tijani Haddad expressed great enthusiasm 
for increasing American tourism to Tunisia and made an 
impassioned plea for increasing the level of cultural 
cooperation and exchanges between our two countries. 
Ambassador noted Northwest Airlines request for a codeshare 
flight and previewed possible USG and business delegation 
visits.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Sporting the traditional djebba in honor of 
Tunisia's March 16 "National Traditional Dress Day", Minister 
of Tourism Tijani Haddad told Ambassador he hopes to see 
greater numbers of American tourists in Tunisia.  Haddad 
noted that in 2006 there were 16,000 American visitors, 
representing an increase over previous years, but nowhere 
near the numbers he would like to see.  Ambassador raised 
Northwest Airlines' request for a codeshare flight with Air 
France and noted that this could pave the way for direct 
flights in the future.  Haddad was enthusiastic about the 
possibility of direct flights, which would increase the 
desirability of Tunisia as a tourist destination for 
Americans, and offered to weigh in positively on the 
codeshare request.  (NOTE: Following the meeting, Ambassador 
sent Minister Haddad details about the Northwest Airlines 
request and asked for Haddad's support.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Shifting to strategy, Haddad outlined the GOT desire 
to move the sector towards high-end and niche tourism.  He 
noted that currently the market is geared toward "sun and 
sea" tourism, which limits the tourist season.  He 
highlighted recent efforts to promote tourism to 
archeological sites and the Sahara as well as making Tunisia 
a destination for golfing and thelassotherapy spa treatments. 
 In addition to the lack of direct air linkages, Haddad noted 
that Americans' lack of awareness about Tunisia serves as a 
secondary impediment to increasing tourism from the United 
States.  To that end, the Ministry has prepared an 
advertising campaign that will air on CNN within the next 
month.  Haddad was eager to enlist the involvement of the 
Embassy in increasing the number of American tourists and the 
level of US investment in tourism.  He responded 
enthusiastically when Ambassador raised the proposed April 
USG economic delegation visit and the possibility of a future 
private sector business delegation. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Haddad lamented the decline in cultural cooperation 
between Tunisia and the United States and remembered a time 
when the American Cultural Center had weekly showings of 
American films.  Haddad, a fluent English speaker, fondly 
reminisced about his previous travels in the United States 
and his own participation in an exchange program.  He was 
particularly enthusiastic when describing the previous visits 
to Tunisia by Neil Armstrong and Senator Ted Kennedy.  "We 
have to go back to that" level of engagement, Haddad 
asserted, because "misunderstanding is the worst thing that 
can happen."  He hoped that linkages between US and Tunisian 
universities would increase and that US universities might 
consider locating in Tunisia.  Ambassador stressed that the 
Embassy was actively working to increase cooperation, 
including on cultural activities. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: With this meeting, Minister Haddad joins 
the growing list of GOT ministers who have strongly advocated 
an increase in exchange programs and a desire for greater US 
investment.  The tourism sector, one of the engines for the 
Tunisian economy, continues to perform well but has grown 
modestly in recent years -- posting only 2.7 percent growth 
in 2006.  While increasing the number of US tourists would 
represent a boon to the tourist sector, Minister Haddad's 
enthusiasm for cultural cooperation and exchange indicate 
that he views tourism not only in economic terms, but also as 
a means to promote mutual understanding.  END COMMENT.
