SUBJECT: DARFUR:  JEM SEEKS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO REFORM, 
JOIN PEACE PROCESS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Two members of the Sudanese Justice and 
Equality Movement (JEM) told poloff June 12 that their 
organization sought to join the peace process under the 
Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) but urgently needed funds to 
hold a general congress in order to elect new leadership. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Chairperson of JEM United Kingdom Ibrahim Abdalla 
and JEM's United Arab Emirates-based Gulf Representative 
Yousif Abaker Adam appeared unannounced at post June 12 to 
present a letter to Charge Huddleston.  The two told poloff 
that the majority of JEM's military chiefs, executive 
leadership and rank-and-file members were ready to accept the 
principles of DPA despite opposition from Khalil Ibrahim 
Mohamed.  Abdalla said that the organization could not 
officially accept the DPA and join the peace process until it 
had removed Mohamed from power through a general congress. 
Abdalla would like to hold such a congress in Addis Ababa in 
three weeks, but needs financial and logistical support for 
such an event.  Abdalla requested that the USG fund a 
congress, including airfare, lodging and meeting space rental 
fees for approximately 200 participants. 
 
¶3.  (U) On June 8, AU Commission for Peace and Security 
Ambassador Said Djinnit announced that Ustaz Abdel Raheem 
Adan Abdel Raheem Abu Risha (General Secretary for JEM, 
Southern Darfur) signed and submitted to the AU a Declaration 
of Commitment to the DPA, on behalf of JEM followers. 
Several representatives of the Abdul Wahid SLM/A faction also 
signed the Declaration of Commitment to the DPA:  chief 
negotiator Dr. Abdel Rahman Musa Abbaker, chief negotiator 
for power-sharing Engineer Ibrahim Madibo, and representative 
of the military commanders Commander Adam Saleh Abbaker.

June 9, 2006 
 
Dear Ambassador, 
 
With reference to our letters to African Union (AU) dated 
20th May 2006 and 8th of June 2006, with regard to Darfur 
Peace Agreement (DPA) wherein we expressed the willingness of 
the majority of the Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement 
(JEM) military and political leaders to join the peace 
process based on the DPA. 
 
We took the initiative to reform our Movement, as the 
leadership of Dr. Khalil Ibrahim Mohamed forms an obstacle to 
both the peace process and the movement future; hence the 
majority of JEM's leaders have taken the decision to organize 
urgently a general congress to restructure the leadership and 
to elect a new chairperson who sign the DPA and participate 
fully in the peace process, reconciliation, rehabilitation 
and development in Darfur. 
 
We urge your great country to continue its effort in 
supporting the peace process by sponsoring the general 
congress fully or partially.  As this general congress is a 
necessary condition for the peace process. 
 
We would be very grateful if your Excellency could arrange an 
urgent meeting with us for more details. 
 
We are looking forward to hear from your Excellency as soon 
as possible, accept our sincere thanks and our deepest 
regards. 
 
Yours Truly, 
 
Signed 
 
Idreas Ibrahim Azrag 
The Offical Spokesperson and Secretary of Information and 
Culture 
Sudanese Justice and Equality Movement
