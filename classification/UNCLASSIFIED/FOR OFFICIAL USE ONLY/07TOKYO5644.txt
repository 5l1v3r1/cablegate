¶1. (U) Japan will provide approximately $2.2 million to 
launch the Chadian Police for Humanitarian Protection (PTPH) 
according to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) First Africa 
Division Deputy Director Sotaro Ozaki.  The funds will be 
used to supply facilities and equipment needed for a PTPH 
headquarters in N'Djamena and an academy to train Chadian 
police.  Once trained, personnel will protect refugees in 
camps in eastern Chad under the supervision of UN police 
officers. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The assistance will supply such things as office and 
computer equipment, vehicles and uniforms, Ozaki continued. 
Japan will not be able to provide personnel to support air 
lifts or helicopter missions, he said. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  According to MOFA International Cooperation Bureau 
Budget Planning Director Naoki Ito, the $2.2 million Japan is 
donating is to replace a shortfall in the project's December 
budget due to non-payment of commitments by the European 
Union.
