(SBU) The Dutch received the information from reftel with 
sincere interest and an expression of shared concerns. 
Pol-Mil Officer delivered reftel points on September 19 to 
the Afghanistan Policy Advisor at the Ministry of Defense and 
the Afghanistan Coordinator at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs.  As the Dutch are preparing to assume command of 
RC-South, they continue to express the need for close 
coordination with all forces operating in areas of 
responsibility.  Dutch commanders are concerened that 
operations conducted in their area of responsibility without 
coordination creates a risk of unnecessary collateral 
casualties.  The Dutch are committed to working with all 
partners to develop a respons system to minimize these types 
of incidents.  The Dutch are also satisfied with the current 
Status of Forces Agreement.
