¶1. (U) On May 8, Econoff delivered reftel demarche to Ms. 
Ulla-Maija Finskas, Head of the Unit for Humanitarian 
Assistance at the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MFA) 
on the need for assistance in Burma following cyclone Nargis. 
 Finskas shared similar U.S. concerns that humanitarian aid 
is being needlessly delayed by the Burmese regime.  The 
Finnish MFA has committed 300,000 euros for emergency relief, 
mainly for blankets, clean water and medicine purposes. 
According to Finskas, the Finnish contribution has already 
been channeled through the Finnish Red Cross.  On May 7, the 
Finnish Red Cross directly pledged an additional 70,000 euros 
for emergency rescue operations.  The Finnish Lutheran Church 
will also provide 200,000 euros in aid through its charity 
foundation, FinnChurchAid, and it has appealed to Finns to 
provide donations to its newly-launched Burma Catastrophe 
Fund.  Finskas said Finland is open to providing additional 
humanitarian contributions once adequate assessments can be 
carried out by international relief workers. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The MFA's Unit for Humanitarian Assistance is 
equally perplexed by the Burmese regime's refusal to grant 
visas quicker to those providing vital humanitarian 
assistance.  Finskas said the Finnish Ambassador in Thailand, 
also accredited to Burma, was finally granted a visa 
following a lengthy delay and a great deal of political 
posturing.  Finskas said the election coinciding with this 
disaster is making the suspicious Burmese regime almost 
paranoid in refusing to grant ready access to international 
relief teams, especially from the United States.
