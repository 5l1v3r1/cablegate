DR-CAFTA IPR REFORMS 
 
REF: MANAGUA 0256 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Summary: Between March 16 and March 21, the 
Nicaraguan National Assembly passed several IPR and penal 
code reforms, and ratified the Budapest Treaty, which was 
required for entry into force of DR-CAFTA by April 1. 
Despite concerns presented by Ministry of Trade (MIFIC) 
officials and members of the private sector earlier in the 
year about the ability to duplicate the narrow margin by 
which DR-CAFTA was ratified in November 2005, these reforms 
passed by wide margins with votes from Liberals, Sandinistas, 
and members of several small parties - with no votes in 
opposition.  One factor in post's multi-pronged approach 
leading to this successful conclusion was a cooperative 
effort between ECON and a group of Nicaraguan musicians and 
owners of entertainment outlets, designed to show the value 
of passing the IPR reforms from the perspective of Nicaraguan 
artists and businesses.  In order to keep the terms of debate 
focused on the protection of Nicaraguan culture rather than 
USG interests, the campaign was conducted under the auspices 
of the Nicaraguan Society for Copyright Protection 
(NICAUTOR).  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) NICAUTOR launched the campaign with a press 
conference attended by 40 TV, radio and newspaper reporters. 
 Several musicians from across the political spectrum, owners 
of legal entertainment businesses and NICAUTOR then waged an 
effective media blitz, garnering positive news stories and 
consistently contesting allegation of opponents to the 
reforms in the weeks leading up to the National Assembly 
votes.  Sixty-four musicians received public attention when 
they published a letter calling for passage of the reforms. 
Several artists also met with newspaper editors and lobbied 
lawmakers directly.  Particularly helpful was the active 
involvement of singer/song writer Carlos Mejia Godoy, a 
cultural icon of the Sandinista Revolution, who helped 
overcome opposition from the left. 
 
¶3. (SBU) With a $2,000 grant from USAID's Nicaragua Mission, 
the group produced 1,000 CDs featuring songs and 
pro-reform/anti-piracy commentary by several of Nicaragua's 
most famous singers and songwriters.  One musician composed a 
catchy anti-piracy ballad specifically for the CD which MIFIC 
began distributing as an e-mail attachment (with permission). 
 The artists' recorded dialogs and public statements centered 
on the economic and cultural damage caused by the illegal 
copying of their work.  The CDs were distributed to National 
Assembly lawmakers, members of the media, and others who 
could influence passage of the IPR reforms. 
 
¶4. (SBU) While ECON conceived of this campaign, and 
coordinated on funding with USAID, the Nicaraguan artistic 
community and entertainment industry quickly embraced it. 
Our IPR partners shared our view that the IPR reforms offered 
a unique opportunity to attract international investment 
through DR-CAFTA entry into force, pass strong IPR 
protections and foster respect for intellectual property in 
Nicaragua.  In fact, the group is continuing its efforts to 
combat piracy.  It has produced a series of 30-second 
commercials featuring the testimonials from the CD, and 
several TV stations and movie theaters have agreed to show 
the commercials indefinitely without charge.  ECON has also 
received initial positive feedback from a private sector 
organization interested in funding mass production of the 
anti-piracy CDs as part of its program to improve the 
investment climate in the country. 
 
¶5. (U) Note: Other important factors in the successful 
DR-CAFTA vote included strong behind the scenes pressure from 
post, active lobbying by the business chambers and a deal 
between the GON and Sandinista leadership to allow three 
"minor" amendments to the reforms in order to by-pass an 
abortive effort by the Liberal Party to hijack the 
legislative process in an attempt to gain amnesty for their 
party leader, ex-president Arnoldo Aleman.  End Note.
