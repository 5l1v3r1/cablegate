SUBJECT: PRT BAMYAN - GOVERNOR SARABI FACES CRITICISM FROM 
THE OLD GUARD 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) This fall there have been a number of complaints 
Bamyan about the lack of development activity as well as 
renewed allegations against Governor Habiba Sarabi.  These 
complaints have spawned visits from two Presidential Advisors 
and a delegation from the Ministry of Interior (MoI).  It 
appears that the opposition comes from a disaffected, and 
perhaps politically motivated few.  Whatever their motives, 
the critics have gained the attention of key central 
government officials. END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Complaints Against Governor Trigger Visit 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In early September (while the Governor Habiba 
Sarabi was in Germany for a conference), four shuras and 
approximately 100 citizens sent a letter to President Karzai 
requesting a change of Governor.  They complained about eight 
issues, the two most significant of which were a lack of 
development in Bamyan and smuggling of historic artifacts by 
the Governor,s committee designated to protect and preserve 
Bamyan,s cultural heritage. 
 
¶3.  (U) Responding to the letter, Presidential Advisors 
Sharboz Hakimi and Mullah Nader Mahdawi visited Bamyan and 
held a meeting to &hear the concerns and issues of 
provincial officials and the local public.8  Mullah Mahdawi 
gave a passionate opening address on the need for unity and 
Afghan self-sufficiency.  He also encouraged the people to 
become more active in public life and to object if officials 
do not carry out their responsibilities or if corruption 
occurs.  When the floor was opened for the public to speak, 
one individual raised a litany of complaints, mirroring those 
issues covered in the letter to President Karzai.  This was 
countered by high praise from several individuals, one of 
whom referred to Governor Sarabi as a woman of the highest 
personal integrity and a mother-like figure for the province. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Press Used to Further Complaints 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) After Ramazan, another complaint surfaced, this time 
as an October 30 article in the Hesbi-Wahdati Islami, a 
journal is closely associated with Second Vice-President, and 
Hesbi-Wahdati party head, Khalili, who is widely believed to 
have party aspirations for the Bamyan Governor,s office. 
The article complains that in contrast to past years when 
provincial officials would welcome the public to their 
offices, this year the provincial officials abandoned the 
province to return home for Eid festivities (implying Bamyan 
officials are predominantly outsiders).  The article also 
charged provincial officials with having done very little for 
the public.

MoI Investigation Degenerates into Sandal Throwing 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) On November 7, a MoI delegation of five individuals 
led by General Adina of the Criminal Investigation Division 
(CID) arrived in Bamyan, informing the ANP Police Chief 
Sayeed Ackbar that they were in Bamyan to investigate 
Governor Habiba Sarabi.  The Governor received notice of the 
impending visit only a day in advance and made clear her 
displeasure. 
¶6.  (SBU) On the evening of November 8, the MoI delegation 
went to the local Bamyan mosque "to hear from the Bamyan 
people.8  According to Police Chief Ackbar, who called an 
emergency Joint Security Group meeting November 9, emotions 
at the mosque were heated.  Apparently Malawi Wazir Ahmad (a 
 
KABUL 00005654  002 OF 002 
 
 
prominent Sunni Tajik who heads two or three local shuras) 
complained of four things - a lack of road construction, a 
lack of distribution of power (energy), no t.v. station, and 
smuggling of artifacts by the Governor,s cultural 
preservation committee. 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) At this point, the governor,s supporters 
apparently accused Malawi Wazir Ahmad and his supporters of 
being Taliban and Al Quaeda supporters.  A man (allegedly the 
Governor,s cousin) then threw a sandal at Malawi Wazir 
Ahmad, which prompted others to follow suit, triggering a 
sandal fight.  At this point the police intervened and 
removed two vans of individuals and took them to the police 
station to calm down. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Government Opposition: A Small Mixed Group 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶8.  (SBU) According to Police Chief Ackbar, the 
anti-government sentiment is coming from a small group of 
Tajik and Hazaran ex-Mujahadeen.  He went on to explain that 
many of the anti-government supporters believe the Governor 
and her Deputy have not earned the right to govern since they 
&abandoned8 Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation. 
These opponents of the governor have even gone so far as to 
nominate &replacements in waiting8 for the Governor,s 
position - Allah Rahmati and Rais Ramatullah are two names 
frequently mentioned.

Governor Sarabi Writes to Karzai 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Following the sandal throwing incident at the 
Mosque, Governor Sarabi wrote directly to President Karzai, 
copying the Minister of Interior.  She criticized the MoI 
delegation for stirring up emotions and causing conflict as 
well as undermining her authority as the President,s 
representative. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) From talking with several officials and hearing the 
issues raised by the public at various meetings, it appears 
the complaints represent the opinions of a relatively small 
group of individuals.  According to Police Chief Ackbar and 
Provincial Council Member Muhsini, Sarabi has, since taking 
over as Governor in March 2005, steadily gained ground with 
the Bamyan public and enjoys a relatively high approval 
rating in Bamyan.  The complaints may well represent the 
frustration of the old guard as it loses ground to the new. 
 
¶11. (SBU) The PRT does not anticipate that the complaints 
will precipitate action by the central government against the 
Governor, especially as she enjoys high visability in the 
international community.  The fact that these complaints are 
receiving attention at the highest levels of the central 
government is nevertheless worrisome to the Governor and a 
distraction from her efforts on behalf of the province.
