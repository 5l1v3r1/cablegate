1.(SBU) Mario Matus, Chair of the General Council, invited Charge to 
consult with him on the PA's bid for observer status in the WTO 
General Council (GC) as it relates to the December 17 meeting of the 
GC.  The agenda for that meeting closes on December 4 and, given 
that the WTO's Ministerial Conference will fill everyone's time next 
week, he is trying to do the rounds discreetly this week.  His 
consultations thus far evidence some shifts in approach but it is 
too soon to tell how this will play out. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According the Matus, the EC is now taking the view that we 
should stick to the tradition of not placing issues such as this on 
the agenda until there is a consensus on the decision to be taken. 
Egypt still wants to place this issue on the agenda, as is the right 
of any WTO Member, but they had thought they would have the company 
of the EC and now they need to check again.  Matus sensed that the 
PA was less inclined to push, though he wasn't certain.  What 
intrigued him more is that he is hearing erstwhile supporters 
starting to raise questions such as who the PA represents (Gaza?) 
and what happens if the head of the PA steps down.  He will speak 
with the Israeli's tomorrow but his read thus far is that they are 
still opposed. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Charge advised Matus that we had agreed with the PA to meet 
with them and hold substantive exchanges on their request.  He noted 
that he did not believe that these consultations would start before 
the agenda closes and that he didn't imagine it would involved just 
a single meeting in any event.  He told Matus that it would be best 
if we could let that process unfold without the issue being forced 
at the December GC.
