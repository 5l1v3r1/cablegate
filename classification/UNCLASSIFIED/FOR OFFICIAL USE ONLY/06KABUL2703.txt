SUBJECT: PRT/GARDEZ  SECURITY WITHOUT GOVERNMENT 
CONTROL: VISIT TO A REMOT DISTRICT IN LOGAR PROVINCE 
 
KABUL 00002703  001.2 OF 003 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY: PRT Gardez recently visited the 
remote Logar district of Azra, which borders 
Pakistan, to secure and remove an arms cache handed 
over to the DIAG program.  ANP control is limited to 
the physical bounds of the station itself and the 
communitys security is completely controlled by the 
tribal structure.  This type of isolated and 
independent community, which can be found throughout 
the southeast region of Afghanistan, is an example 
of a place where the authority of the Government of 
Afghanistan (GoA) does not currently exist, but 
traditional structures are maintaining a peaceful 
environment.  In the absence of a strong government 
presence, this is also the type of border community 
that might serve as a conduit for the insurgency. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Last month, PRT Gardez and maneuver 
battalion embarked on a four-hour drive through 
stream beds and winding narrow mountainous roads for 
an overnight mission to the Logar district of Azra 
to secure and remove an arms cache surrendered to 
the DIAG (Disbandment of Illegal Armed Groups) 
program, which was stored at the district ANP 
station.  Azra is the most remote district in Logar 
Province and the only Logar district bordering 
Pakistan.  The district was once part of Loya Paktia 
(the former province consisting of present Paktia, 
Paktika and Khost provinces).  It retains strong 
tribal structures and in the past was known as a 
smugglers alley. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The PRT was hosted by the district ANP 
station, located in the center of the small village 
nestled in a narrow valley.  When the convoy arrived 
at the station, about 20 ANP officers were standing 
at attention in formation in uniforms clearly worn 
for the first timestill dust-free and creased from 
packagingfor the benefit of the visiting Americans. 
PRToff used the opportunity of the visit to discuss 
the security situation and the condition of the ANP. 
It quickly became apparent that ANP control is 
limited to the physical bounds of the station 
on 
itself.   The ANP reported that they had 42 police 
on payroll and one Russian jeep to patrol the 
district.  They complained that they have no Afghan 
Border Police (ABP) stationed along the Pakistan 
border, which left the ANP district station 
responsible for securing the border.  Without 
vehicles, ammunition, or issued weapons heavier than 
a Kalashnikov, they claimed they were incapable of 
stopping outsiders from coming across the border. 
They have no means to communicate with the ANP 
headquarters in Pul-e Alam.  Additionally, they told 
us that the Czech AK 47 rifles that they were issued 
were unreliable (a common complaint among ANP in 
Paktia and Logar Provinces). 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Still, the ANP boasted there were no 
recorded security incidents and noted the tribes 
were an essential partner in this success.  After 
further probing, the police admitted that almost all 
problems in the district were handled through 
tribal shuras.  The tribes maintain security through

h 
the arbakai system (the shura selects and arms 
members of the community to protect tribal 
resources; it was in decline in the last century, 
but was revived by the Soviets to provide protection 
against the mujahadeen).  Governor Taniwal in Paktia 
province is currently using this system to 
supplement the ANP.  He is paying the tribes 
approximately USD40 per month per armed arbakai, who 
are usually embedded in the district ANP stations. 
In contrast to Paktia province, however, the arbakai 
in Logar are securing the area as part of their 
traditional tribal duty and not for pay.  Arbakai 
coordination there with the ANP is also less evident 
than in Paktia.  In fact, Governor Hashimi seemed 
surprised when PRToff noted that there were arbakai 
in the district and the ANP chief and his deputy did 
not address PRToffs questions about the cooperation 
between the arbakai and ANP in Azra, noting it is a 
special case. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  The partnership between the ANP and the 
e 
tribes (four sub-tribes of the Ahmadzai tribe) is 
not limited to the use of the arbakai.  The people 
rely on tribal shuras for conflict resolution.  Even 
when an issue is brought to the attention of the 
police, in most cases, at the insistence of the 
tribes, the police turn the issue over to the shura 
for internal dispute resolution through Pashtunwali, 
the tribal code.  When PRToff asked for an example 
of issues that are handled through the rule of law, 
the police mentioned a land dispute between two sub- 
tribes that was submitted to Pul-e Alam, the 
provincial capital, for arbitration. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  The sense of tribal control was reinforced 
when PRToff and a U.S. Army Civil Affairs officer 
met with a tribal shura.  As soon as the verses from 
the Quran were recited to open the meeting, the 
elder sitting front-and-center explained that Azra 
had not had a single security incident, but this was 
not due to the GOA or ANP.  He said the ANP were 
nothing - only the tribes provide security for the 
e 
area.  The tribal shura also complained that while 
they had kept security in the district, the ANP had 
discouraged NGOs from working.  The ANP publicly 
challenged that assertion, but it was clear that the 
ANP did not feel they could guarantee the safety of 
NGOs. 
 
¶8. (SBU)  Comment:  Strong tribal structures in 
southeast Afghanistan, like those in Azra, tend to 
result from geographic isolation.  Because of Azras 
remote location, the tribes there are independent 
and self-sufficient.  For example, the community has 
year-round water supply through mountain runoff, 
which also provides them with electricity created by 
a micro-hydro plant at least partially paid for by 
the community.  This isolation and independence from 
government services also make it more difficult for 
GOA security and governance structures to extend 
their reach into these areas.  At this time, the 
tribes are able to maintain peace among themselves

and probably protect the ANP station, rather than 
the other way around.  Without government influence, 
however, this area, once known as a smugglers 
alley. could be a conduit for the insurgency.  PRT 
Gardez is trying to address the ANP communication 
issues and other ways to extend GOA reach into the 
community. End Comment.
