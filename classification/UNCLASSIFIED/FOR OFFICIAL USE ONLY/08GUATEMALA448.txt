(SBU) On April 9, Poloff delivered Reftel A demarche and 
copies of UNSCRS resolutions 1737, 1747, and 1803 to Leila 
Villatoro, Deputy Director of Multilateral Policy at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Poloff drew Villatoro's 
attention to the travel ban for individuals listed in the 
UNSC resolutions, inquired into the GOG's mechanism for 
ensuring compliance with the resolutions, and offered U.S. 
assistance regarding the implementation of the travel-related 
provisions in UNSCRs 1737, 1747, and 1803.  Villatoro thanked 
Poloff for bringing the resolutions to her attention and for 
the U.S. offer of assistance in interpreting the resolutions 
if needed.  She stated that it is her understanding that the 
individuals listed in the resolutions would be addressed by 
the GOG using the system in place to prevent terrorist 
suspects from entering Guatemala.  She promised to confirm 
the GOG's exact process for implementation of the travel 
vigilance and ban, and get back to Poloff with further 
details.  Villatoro used the opportunity to clarify the GOG's 
position reported in Reftel C regarding the transfer of dual 
use items listed in UNSC resolution 1803.  She stated that 
the GOG fully supports resolution 1803 and will incorporate 
items listed in the resolution into their export control 
regime.
