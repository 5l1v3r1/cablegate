MICRO-REACTOR WORKING GROUP PROPOSAL 
 
REF: A. BERLIN 1033 
     ¶B. STATE 87595 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On September 3, MFA Export Control Division Desk 
Officer, Nancy Reck, relayed to EconOff German Federal Office 
of Economics and Export Control's (BAFA) views on the US 
Australia Group (AG) proposal to establish an experts working 
group on micro-reactor systems (MRS).  Reck said Germany 
welcomes establishing an experts working group on MRS, but 
only within the context of a larger "New and Emerging 
Technologies" working group, which Germany would like to see 
formed in the 2009-2010 time frame. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Reck said BAFA is ready and willing to intensify 
outreach to German industry on MRS and the proliferation 
threat they entail.  Reck also said BAFA currently has no 
position on appending AG lists with MRS related technology. 
(COMMENT: Reck indicated BAFA's biggest concern with MRS 
relates to the process of listing these technologies.  END 
COMMENT)
