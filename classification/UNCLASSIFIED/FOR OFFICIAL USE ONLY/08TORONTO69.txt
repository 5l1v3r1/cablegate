¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Over the past two months, Toronto Police rounded 
up 96 street-level drug dealers in western Toronto.  The 
retail-level arrests come on the heels of a separate Toronto Police 
undercover operation that arrested 23 drug dealers in the downtown 
core of the city.  On February 27 the Canadian Border Services 
Agency (CBSA) seized a land border record of 230 kilograms of 
cocaine with an estimated street value of C$28.7 million from a 
transport truck at the Blue Water Bridge near Sarnia, Ontario.  We 
are encouraged by Toronto Police efforts to identify and arrest 
small but visible street-level drug dealers.  END SUMMARY.

Toronto Police Tackle Retail Drug Trade

¶2. (U) On Monday, February 4, 2008, Toronto Police units began a 
five week undercover drug trafficking investigation dubbed Project 
I.C.E. (Infiltrate Crack Entrepreneurs) to address community 
concerns about drug trafficking in five Toronto neighborhoods.  As 
of March 11, 2008 96 suspects have been arrested and 238 drug 
related charges filed.  45 of those arrested were free on bail or 
probation when they were arrested for the new offences.  Police 
targeted five neighborhoods in the western areas of Toronto.  A wide 
variety of illicit drugs were seized including:  318 grams of 
cocaine and crack with a street value of C$31,800; 415 grams of 
marijuana with a street value of C$800; C$10,798 in cash proceeds of 
designated drug offences; and other drugs including hashish 
(cannabis sativa), Special K (ketamine), ecstasy, 
(MDMA-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine), GHB (Gamma hydroxybutyrate), 
LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide), and Magic Mushroom (Psilocybin). 
 
 
¶3. (U) Project I.C.E. comes on the heels of two other similar 
large-scale undercover drug busts.  Operation "Take the Money and 
Run," on February 27, 2008 led to 23 arrests and 61 drug-related 
charges against street-level drug dealers in and around Toronto's 
downtown Yonge Street corridor (ref (A)).  In September, 2007, a 
ten-month long joint investigation with U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) agents led the RCMP to arrest 11 Toronto-area 
residents and ICE to arrest 12 people in the U.S. for drug 
trafficking (ref (B)).

Cocaine Seized on its Way to Toronto 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (U) On February 27 the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) 
seized 129 bricks of cocaine weighing 230 kilograms with an 
estimated street value of C$28.7 million, the largest land border 
seizure in Canadian history, from the cab of a transport truck at 
the Blue Water Bridge near Sarnia, Ontario.  The truck driver, a 
Toronto-area resident, was arrested and charged with unlawfully 
importing drugs and possession of cocaine for the purpose of 
trafficking.  That seizure followed by just one day a February 26 
seizure by CBSA officers of C$3.1 million worth of cocaine at the 
Detroit/Windsor Ambassador Bridge (ref (A)). 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  We are encouraged by Toronto Police efforts to 
clean up city streets by identifying and arresting small but visible 
retail-level drug dealers.  The CBSA record cocaine seizures at 
major U.S.-Ontario border crossings are also extremely positive. 
Ontario-based law enforcement agencies are working hard to combat 
the drug trade through a series of highly successful undercover drug 
projects.  Yet, the recent significant seizures along the 
U.S.-Ontario border demonstrate the continued profitability of the 
trans-border drug trade and the importance of continued information 
sharing and operational cooperation between U.S. and Canadian law 
enforcement agencies in stemming the flow of drugs, guns, and 
illicit cash across the border.  END COMMENT.
