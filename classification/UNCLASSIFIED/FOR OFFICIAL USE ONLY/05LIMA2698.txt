(SBU) On 6/8, A/Polcouns delivered Ref B talking points and 
background on U.S. support for the Swiss Government's 
proposal to convene a diplomatic conference on the Third 
Additional Protocol to Foreign Ministry Director for Human 
Rights Carlos Roman.  In a follow-up conversation on 6/16, 
Roman said he had recommended to Foreign Minister Rodriguez 
that the GOP support holding this conference in October, and 
that Peru should also support the adoption of the Third 
Protocol and of a new emblem for the Red Cross/Red Crescent 
Movement.  Roman hoped to have the Minister's concurrence by 
6/17, and said he would advise us if there were any change in 
the GOP's position.
