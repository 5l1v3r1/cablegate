It is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.   (SBU) SUMMARY:  Mission submits two proposals to S/CT 
for consideration under the Ambassadors Counterterrorism Fund 
solicitation (reftel).  One proposal requests $45,000 to 
support the sponsoring of a series of sports diplomacy 
clinics on the island of Sulawesi, a former conflict area. 
The other proposal seeks $50,000 in support of the Indonesian 
prison system and terrorist deradicalization programs.  Brief 
descriptions of these two proposals follow below.  More 
comprehensive versions of the proposals have been e-mailed to 
S/CT.  RSI Coordinator has been briefed on the proposals. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Mission's two proposals for S/CT Ambassadors 
Counterterrorism funding consideration follow: 
 
-- A) SPORTS DIPLOMACY CLINICS:  Mission proposes a series of 
sports diplomacy clinics to be held in former conflict areas 
of Indonesia.  The clinics--which will teach soccer 
techniques (soccer is the most popular sport in 
Indonesia)--will focus on the island of Sulawesi.  Areas of 
the island have struggled with extremist and sectarian 
violence over the years.  Areas such as Poso, central 
Sulawesi, were seen by Islamic jihadists as a training ground 
to gain combat experience, for example.  Parts of Sulawesi 
also serve as maritime transit routes for terrorists who 
shuttle back-and-forth between Indonesia, the Philippines and 
Malaysia. 
 
While the past few years have seen a decline in sectarian 
violence, the promotion of good community relations in the 
region is an important key toward helping prevent a return to 
violence.  This program proposes to utilize soccer clinics as 
a vehicle for providing information to youths from all 
communities re the threat of terrorism and extremism and the 
importance of tolerance and law enforcement.  The Indonesian 
National Police would implement the program.  The estimated 
cost of the program is $45,321. 
 
-- B) MANAGEMENT OF TERRORIST PRISONERS:  Mission also 
proposes to support an initiative by the Directorate General 
(DG) for Prisons to create a set of guidelines for the 
handling of terrorists in prison.  The proposal would create 
an interagency team led by the DG's office that would include 
representatives from the police, the Department of Religion, 
and academia.  The team would survey conditions in several 
prisons with significant terrorist populations, consult with 
experts and deradicalized former terrorists, and produce a 
guidebook which would be replicated for use by prison 
officials. 
 
The guidelines would focus on two main themes:  improving 
security and surveillance of terrorist prisoners and 
fostering deradicalization.  The deradicalization program 
would be partly modeled on the successful approach currently 
being used by the Indonesian police (ref B) and likely have 
two main components: an ideological component, which would 
expose terrorist prisoners to more mainstream Islamic 
teachings; and a vocational component, which would promote 
economic self-sufficiency.  The estimated cost of this 
program is $50,000.  Mission would seek additional funding to 
support the dissemination and implementation of the program.
