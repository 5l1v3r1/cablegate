STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN 
 
(SBU) Prime Minister Kosor, when asked for a reaction to the 
President's speech on Afghanistan, told the media on December 
2 that the GoC strongly supports President Obama's plan, 
which she described as "full of optimism and hope for the 
future and the chances of a resolution in Afghanistan."  She 
went on to state that Croatia "wants to participate and will 
participate in the strengthening of the Afghan people so that 
they can independently rule and protect their own country." 
(Note:  Croatia currently has 300 troops in ISAF including 
three Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams (OMLTs) and has 
approved plans for the deployment of two police OMLTs.  End 
Note.)  The Prime Minister concluded by noting that: 
"Croatia, as a member of NATO, respects its commitments and 
this is how it will be in the future as well."
