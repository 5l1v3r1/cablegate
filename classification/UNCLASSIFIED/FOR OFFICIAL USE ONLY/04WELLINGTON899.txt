SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND UNABLE TO CO-SPONSOR RESOLUTION ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS IN BELARUS 
 
REF: STATE 230264 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post delivered reftel resolution to Val Meyer, 
Deputy Director of the Human Rights Division, New Zealand 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT.)  Meyer 
responded that, while there was no objection to the text as 
written, the GoNZ would not co-sponsor the resolution.  Meyer 
cited resource constraints, noting that the GoNZ does not 
have accreditation with Belarus, and does not feel it has 
adequately followed the domestic human rights situation in 
that country.  She emphasized that, prior to the UN General 
Assembly, the NZ delegation carefully selected priority issue 
areas, and is unable to deviate far from these selected 
topics. 
 
¶2. (SBU)   She added that NZ's voting on this issue will 
depend on the outcome of the formal and informal 
negotiations, and the resulting final text.  She noted that 
the GoNZ prefers to "stand back and watch" negotiations 
before committing to a final position, especially on a topic 
where they have no predetermined stand. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Despite their reluctance to co-sponsor, 
Post believes that New Zealand will support the resolution if 
no substantial textual changes are made.
