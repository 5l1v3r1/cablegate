     ¶B. TSOU-TAECKER EMAILS/TELCONS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband will probably 
lead the UK delegation to the May 29 International Compact 
with Iraq (ICI) Ministerial in Stockholm, Miliband's Chief of 
Staff Matthew Gould told us May 9.  The UK is not planning 
any deliverables for the meeting, FCO Iraq Group officers Tim 
Ayres and Graeme Plato told us May 8, although it will 
highlight its ongoing assistance efforts in the south, 
particularly the Basra Development Council.  Nonetheless, HMG 
is working with Sweden on a strong statement of support for 
the ICI that would be issued at the GAERC meeting on May 28. 
This statement will probably not contain concrete 
deliverables, but it will be more substantive than the 
previous GAERC statement from November 2007, Plato said. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) HMG feels strongly that the ICI Secretariat needs 
to be transformed into an effective body with full-time, 
trained personnel, and will press the Iraqi government to 
fund a permanent office and staff, Ayres and Plato said.  The 
lack of such an organization means that many ICI goals and 
objectives tend to lie dormant between international 
meetings, Ayres said.  He noted that the UK Department for 
International Development (DFID) had dispatched trainers to 
Iraq to train staff after the Sharm El Sheikh meeting, but 
that the trainers had returned home when it became clear 
there would be no staff to train. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The UK is concerned about the World Bank presence 
in Iraq and would be happy to assist the U.S. in talking to 
the World Bank about increasing its mission, if desirable, 
Ayres said.  Ayres and Plato also agreed to follow up on U.S. 
conversations by finding ways for UK officials to press 
Poland and Greece on debt relief.
