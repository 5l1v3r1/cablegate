¶1. (U) Per reftel, DCM spoke with Minister of State for 
Foreign Affairs Ambassador Bagudu Hirse on December 30 
regarding reftel request and offer.  Hirse underscored 
Nigeria's intent to deploy a full battalion to Somalia, and 
asked for a note verbale laying out our points so that he 
could take it up with his "higher authorities".  Note has 
been forwarded to Ambassador Hirse. 
 
¶2. (U) Ambassador is attempting to reach Foreign Minister Ojo 
Madeukwe by phone, who is currently out of Abuja. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: We have raised Nigeria's deployment of a 
battalion to Somalia and our willingness to supply equipment 
many times over the past year (reftels).  Given Nigeria's 
track record to date on responding to this issue as well as 
the pending $3 million the USG has promised Nigeria for 
military equipment, we doubt that the GON will move in a 
timely manner on this demarche, but we will continue to push 
the issue.
