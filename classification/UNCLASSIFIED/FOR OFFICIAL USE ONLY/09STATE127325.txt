¶1. (U) This is an Action Request. See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on Technical Assistance Agreement 
TA113-04C for the export to Germany of technical data related 
to the production of ammunition manufacturing equipment. 
Post is requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 
45 days. Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect 
pending and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Reason for Request: This Technical Assistance 
Agreement (TAA) is for the transfer of technical data to 
Germany to facilitate the design and production of ammunition 
manufacturing equipment.  The end-user in this TAA Fritz 
Werner Industrie-Ausrustungen GmbH of Germany (Fritz Werner 
Germany) will produce the ammunition manufacturing equipment. 
 The company has a long history in Burma that culminated in 
the establishment of Myanmar Fritz Werner Industries Co. Ltd. 
in Burma (Myanmar Fritz Werner).  Burma is currently a 
proscribed country under part 126.1 of the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  The current relationship 
between Fritz Werner Germany and Myanmar Fritz Werner is 
unclear.  Open source reporting indicates that a delegation 
from Fritz Werner Germany was in Burma as recently as 
November 2006 (REFTEL).  This check is to determine the 
extent of Fritz Werner Germany's involvement with Myanmar 
Fritz Warner and to establish the bona fides of the German 
company. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action Request:  Post is requested to establish the 
bona fides of German end-user Fritz Werner 
Indusrtie-Ausrustungen GmbH by making inquiries with 
representatives of the company and German government 
officials.  Specifically, Post is requested determine the 
relationship between the company and Myanmar Fritz Werner 
Industries Co. Ltd. of Burma.  Post is also requested to make 
inquiries with other U.S. agencies at Post for any 
information on the company.  The following points are 
included for guidance: 
 
(To Fritz Werner Indusrtie-Ausrustungen GmbH) 
 
--When was your company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What products and services does your company provide?  Who 
are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
--What are you annual sales of U.S.-origin defense articles, 
technical data, and services? 
 
--Do you sell U.S.-origin defense articles, technical data, 
or services to customers that reside outside Germany?  Do you 
ever use U.S.-origin technical data to manufacture defense 
articles that are then sold to parties outside Germany? 
 
--Do you have any offices or subsidiaries outside Germany? 
If so, what are the names of these companies and where do 
they reside?  Please explain your relationship to these 
companies. 
 
--Do you have an official relationship with Myanmar Fritz 
Werner Industries Co. Ltd. of Burma?  If so, please describe 
this relationship.  Do you provide any defense articles or 
services to this company or the Government of Burma? 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing U.S.-origin 
defense articles and technical data, including restrictions 
on re-transfer, re-export, and changes in end-use? 
 
(To Appropriate Import/Export and/or Law Enforcement 
Authorities) 
 
--Do you have any information on Fritz Werner 
Indusrtie-Ausrustungen GmbH that would question their 
reliability as a recipient of U.S. defense articles or 
technical data? 
 
--Are you aware of any business relationships with 
questionable entities outside Germany? 
 
--Is trade with entities in Burma legal under German laws and 
regulations? 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
