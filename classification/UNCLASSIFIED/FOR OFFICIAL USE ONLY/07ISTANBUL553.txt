Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary. Van Yeutter, Director of International 
Business Development for Cargill, Inc., and Mustafa Sayintac, 
CEO of Cargill-Turkey, told Ambassador and CG officers on 
June 7 in Istanbul that Cargill-Turkey's largest factory, 
which was ordered to close down last year, remains open 
pending a Constitutional Court ruling on a law passed earlier 
this year that legalized the plant's location on protected 
agricultural land. End summary. 
 
BACKGROUND ON CARGILL AND ITS ORHANGAZI PLANT 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Cargill, Inc. is an international provider of food, 
agricultural and risk management products and services with 
over 150,000 employees in 66 countries. The company is based 
in Minneapolis and maintains its Turkey head office in 
Istanbul. Cargill-Turkey operates three factories in the 
country. Its largest, a corn sweetener plant in Orhangazi, 
was ordered to cease operations in 1996 after it was deemed 
to have been built on protected agricultural land. Cargill 
challenged the order in court and after eight years of 
litigation, the Administrative Board of the High Court of 
Appeals upheld the decision to shut down the Orhangazi plant. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Turkish parliament passed a bill on November 24, 
2006 that would have granted Cargill-Turkey and several 
thousand other companies amnesty, but the bill was vetoed by 
President Sezer two weeks later. Parliament overruled the 
veto in a second vote on February 1, 2007, but on February 9 
Sezer exercised his prerogative to refer parts of it to the 
Constitutional Court for review. A final judgment in this 
case is still pending. 
 
DISCUSSION 
---------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Yeutter said he was sent to Istanbul to examine 
possible options for a resolution of the Orhangazi issue. He 
noted that chances of a legal judgment in favor of 
Cargill-Turkey are "very slim."  The company expects further 
challenges from NGOs in local courts and from local 
government officials. Because Cargill has been unable to make 
any headway on the legal front concerning the Orhangazi 
issue, the company is hoping to reach a political solution to 
it. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Yeutter said that if the plant is forced to close, 
Cargill would institute international arbitration proceedings 
against the Turkish government and expressed confidence that 
the company would win such a case. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment:  The AKP government has been supportive of 
a resolution of the legal case favorable to Cargill.  Given 
that Turkey is currently in the midst of an election 
campaign, an aggressive intervention by the government in the 
court case seems unlikely.  Ambassador also recommended that 
Yeutter and Sayintac reach out to opposition political 
parties that could become more influential following the 
elections.  End Comment.
