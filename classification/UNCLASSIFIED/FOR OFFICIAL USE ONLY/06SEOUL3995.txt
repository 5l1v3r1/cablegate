REF: STATE 188244 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On November 17, poloff delivered reftel demarche, 
urging capitals to vote against or abstain on an unbalanced 
draft resolution on Israel that was to be proposed later that 
day at an Emergency Special Session (ESS) of the UNGA, to Lee 
Kyung-chul, Deputy Director of the UN Division, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Lee said his office would need to 
study the text of the draft resolution that poloff provided. 
The UN Division, however, was unable to provide a fuller 
response by close of business. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On November 20, poloff called on Kim Chul-lee, 
another Deputy Director at MOFAT's UN Division, for an 
explanation of the ROKG vote for the ESS resolution adopted 
on November 17.  Kim stated that Seoul had intended to 
abstain on the original draft in consideration of the USG 
position.  Following European Union-initiated modifications 
to the text's language, Seoul decided to side with the 
majority to adopt the resolution.  Kim stressed that the EU 
and Japan also supported the resolution to produce its 
adoption by a vote of 156-7-6.
