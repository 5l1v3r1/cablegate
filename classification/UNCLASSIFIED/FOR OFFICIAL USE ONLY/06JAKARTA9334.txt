SUBJECT: INDONESIAN HEALTH MINISTER PRAISES COOPERATION 
AND NAMRU-2 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Minister of Health Dr. Siti Fadilah Supari 
told the Ambassador on July 24 that the Ministry of Health 
(MOH) is committed to cooperation with NAMRU-2 and will 
assist in the finalization of a new Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU).  She noted that the Government of 
Indonesia (GOI) is pleased with USG collaboration on various 
health challenges such as avian influenza (AI) and polio and 
thanked USAID and NAMRU-2 for their support.  She also 
expressed interest in receiving additional financial 
assistance for a public health awareness campaign to be 
carried out at the village level.  The Ambassador 
congratulated the Minister for success on polio eradication 
as evidenced by the high vaccination rate in the population 
and the long interval since the last case was detected but 
noted the concern that Indonesia is still at risk for polio. 
The Ambassador conveyed his appreciation for the cooperation 
and transparency shown in combating avian influenza in the 
human population but noted his continued concern about the 
Ministry of Agriculture's lack of effectiveness in 
controlling the disease in the animal population.  The 
Ambassador also conveyed USG willingness to help on other 
MOH issues such as providing Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) 
laboratory technical assistance.  He pledged to work with 
the MOH as other health priorities become identified.  End 
Summary. 
 
Natural Disasters, Polio and Avian Influenza 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a July 24 call on the Minister of Health, the 
Ambassador expressed his condolences for the recent series 
of tsunami and earthquake tragedies in Indonesia, noting the 
increased burden this placed on the MOH.  He congratulated 
the Minister for her success in controlling polio as 
evidenced by both the high vaccination rate and the fact 
that no new cases have been reported in the last 5 months. 
He noted that polio remains a significant risk in Indonesia 
with many children under five years old still insufficiently 
immunized.  The Minister noted that additional vaccination 
campaigns are planned. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Ambassador conveyed his appreciation for the 
Ministry's cooperation and transparency shown in combating 
avian influenza in the human population but noted his 
continued concern about the Ministry of Agriculture's lack 
of effectiveness in controlling the disease in the animal 
population.  He emphasized that good cooperation and sharing 
of samples will be crucial to managing the AI challenge. 
The Ambassador explained that AI in Indonesia is being 
closely followed in Washington.  He noted that USAID is 
finalizing the $11.5 million in assistance promised by 
Secretary Rice in March 2006 and that the USG will continue 
 
SIPDIS 
to provide other technical assistance from the Centers for 
Disease Control, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
 
 
NAMRU-2 Memorandum of Understanding 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Ambassador praised the increased cooperation 
between NAMRU-2 and LITBANGKES (National Institute of Health 
Research and Development) with the recent appointment of Dr. 
Triono, as Director General.  He expressed appreciation for 
the Minister's support of NAMRU-2 but also noted that the 
Minister could further help by rescinding the October 25, 
2005 letter, regarding NAMRU-2 status.  The Minister 
acknowledged that the NAMRU-2 MOU was receiving support from 
higher levels and turned to Triono to describe the next 
steps.  Triono explained that a number of MOUs are being 
examined in detail in order to study the NAMRU-2 MOU and 
that a final decision would be forthcoming. (Comment: 
Minister Supari did not respond about rescinding the letter 
and may not have understood the reference.  LITBANGKES' 
October 25, 2005 circular to all Ministry of Health units 
terminating all collaboration with NAMRU-2 on 31 December 
2005 remains in force.  However, intervention by senior GOI 
officials prevented the full implementation of this 
circular.  Dr. Triono's April 2006 appointment as the new 
Director General of LITBANGKES did much to improve relations 
with NAMRU-2.  Recent meetings with DEPLU indicate that the 
GOI is ready to move forward on negotiations of a new NAMRU- 
2 MOU.  End Comment.) 
 
BSL-3 Labs, Disease Prevention 
------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) Ambassador Pascoe noted the USG was prepared to 
assist in other MOH issues such as BSL3 laboratory 
development.  Triono acknowledged that he had met with 
Department experts on BSL3 development and was awaiting 
follow-up.  Minister Supari also described the MOH's plan to 
establish national minimum health services standards for 
regional offices.  She noted MOH's need for USD 35 million 
in financial assistance to help launch a communications 
strategy for 9,000 pilot villages.  It would later be 
expanded to 70,000 villages so that workers can provide 
information on avian influenza, malaria, and other diseases. 
(Note: USAID is supporting village level AI and other 
disease prevention through its AI and Maternal and Child 
Health programs. End Note.) The Ambassador concluded the 
meeting by emphasizing the importance of continued close 
communication between the MOH and the Embassy and pledged to 
work with the MOH on evolving health priorities.
