SUBJECT: COSTA RICA PLACES HOLD ON OIL FOR FOOD LETTER 
 
¶1. (SBU) On March 28, the Russian Presidency of the Security 
Council circulated a draft response to the Secretary-General 
on closing down the Oil for Food program (OFF).  The draft 
was derived from a Department-drafted nonpaper, and enjoyed 
the support of the P5.  On April 1, Costa Rica placed a hold 
on the draft, saying it needed additional time to examine the 
proposals contained therein.  As of April 18, Costa Rica 
continued to maintain its hold.  It has changed the rationale 
for the hold, and now says it will maintain it until at least 
the end of April, when a meeting on OFF issues is scheduled 
between the UN and the Iraqi government.  Letters from the 
Security Council must be agreed to by all 15 members of the 
Council. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Poloff called Amar Al-Hulluo at the Iraqi Mission, 
who explained that the Costa Rican mission had contacted the 
Iraqi Mission to ask if they should maintain the hold.  The 
Iraqi mission, upon instructions from Baghdad, requested that 
Costa Rica continue to maintain the hold until at least the 
end of April.  Separately, Poloff and POL M/C contacted the 
Costa Rica Mission, and was told that instructions to 
maintain the hold came directly from Foreign Minister (and 
former UN PermRep) Stagno. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: USUN requests the Department engage 
with Costa Rica and Iraq to ask that the hold be lifted.  END 
ACTION REQUEST.
