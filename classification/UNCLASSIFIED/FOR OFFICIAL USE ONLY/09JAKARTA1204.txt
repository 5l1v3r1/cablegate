¶3.  (SBU) Welcoming these developments, and in particular the 
"breakthrough" on health cooperation, D-G Retno asked whether 
the Ambassador could confirm a visit to Indonesia by 
President Obama in the fall.  Ambassador replied that he 
hoped a decision would be made in the near future.  Retno 
also reported:

INL funds.  Ambassador added that some funding from the 
recently passed supplemental might be made available to 
Indonesia, but that issues remained to be resolved. 
¶4. (SBU) Comprehensive Partnership agreement: D-G Retno urged 
that the U.S. respond to Indonesia,s draft Comprehensive 
Partnership Agreement.  Asked about the EU,s Partnership and 
Cooperation agreement, she noted that the 25-page document,

including education, transportation, human rights, security, 
culture, and forestry.  The U.S. she noted, sought a brief, 
simple and flexible document.
