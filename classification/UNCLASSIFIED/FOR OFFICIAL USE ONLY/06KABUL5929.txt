SUBJECT: POSITIVE REACTIONS TO PRESIDENTIAL PAG IN KANDAHAR 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  (SBU) According to a sampling of official, 
press, and political analyst reactions to President Karzai's 
December 11-13 PAG visit to Kandahar, most Afghans viewed his 
visit to the South positively.  They felt it was about time 
he criticized Pakistan publicly and want him and his 
Ministers to travel more extensively around the country. 
Foreign media question how long the positive effect will 
last, given the ongoing instability in the South.  The series 
of shuras that Karzai held in the South seemed to have the 
biggest impact and his criticism of Pakistan had particular 
resonance among tribal elders and attendees.  END SUMMARY 
 
Official Reaction 
----------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) MFA Gender and Human Rights Office Director, Zohra 
Rasekh, praised Karzai for traveling to Kandahar and for 
blaming Pakistan for Afghanistan,s instability.  She said 
that Afghans were very angry at Pakistan.  Taking a stand 
like Karzai did helped alleviate some of the pressure that 
had been building among Afghan attitudes towards Pakistan. 
She and others want the President to travel more around the 
country. 
 
Afghan and International Media 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Initial reactions in the Afghan press were 
positive, especially in response to the sections of the 
speech on Pakistan.  Reaction covered by the media (both 
state run and private media) has included commentary saying 
that not only did people approve of what Karzai said, but 
they were also impressed by his recent shows of emotions that 
demonstrate how he has been personally affected by what is 
going on the country. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Commentary from Radio Azadi based on on-the-street 
interviews with people in Kandahar was also positive.  Many 
were impressed that Karzai had gone to Kandahar and were 
pleased that he spoke with the average person there, 
particularly regarding his message on Pakistan and the 
symbols of GOA support he brought to Kandahar.  Most provided 
little detail on what they approved of or saw as positive, 
but the act of going to Kandahar and holding public events 
and meetings appears to have resonated, although it remains 
to be seen how long or how deep that reaction will last. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) On the international media front, it was a mixed 
bag.  Several journalists commented that the overall optic 
may have been positive on the street, although they question 
how much impact it will have, given the continued negative 
stories coming out about foreign military actions on the 
ground -) all of which may serve (according to international 
media that accompanied the President) to highlight the 
inability of the GOA to provide aid and assistance to the 
people in the South. 
 
View from the South 
------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The shuras that Karzai held after the PAG seem to 
have had the biggest impact in Kandahar itself.  Governor 
Assadullah organized a Panjwayi-specific shura the evening of 
December 12 with a good representation of all the tribal 
elders and leaders.  The conversation -- focused on security 
in Kandahar -- was reportedly so successful that they 
continued the discussion on December 13.  There was also a 
second shura between Karzai and elders/leaders from the South 
more generally (about 1000 people).  Karzai was reportedly 
very engaged, "realizing he was needed", according to the 
Dutch RC-South POLAD.  The heavy emphasis on Pakistan (and on 
convoy procedures) was indeed aimed at appeasing public 
sentiments in Kandahar, as ordinary people in the south are 
very quick to blame Pakistan for insecurity.

¶7.  (SBU) At a political gathering in Kandahar sponsored by 
Cheragh (a daily newspaper) on the upcoming cross-border 
Jirga, press and political analysts offered thoughts on 
Karzai,s trip to Kandahar.  Jawad Sarwari, a reporter for 
Cheragh Daily, who accompanied the President to Kandahar said 
it was the first time Karzai made such important, strong, and 
impressive remarks about the Pakistani government and their 
purported interference in Afghanistan.  The reporter felt 
that Karzai showed strong leadership by talking to the public 
and students in Kandahar, particularly when Karzai said that 
"the Russians, British, Alexander The Great, and Genghis Khan 
could not occupy this land, the land of Afghans.  How can 
Pakistanis think of turning us into their slaves?8   Sarwari 
said that Karzai shouldn't have cried during his recent Human 
Rights Gathering.  Rather, he should have showed more 
strength in confronting human rights violations in the 
country.  A good leader never cries, said Sarwari. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Some political analysts believe the trip to 
Kandahar was more of a "power show", as Karzai was under 
tremendous pressure from the international community, 
especially the U.S., to speak up and show his ability to 
fight terrorism and the insurgency in the region.  However, 
his speech was a total surprise for most of the Kandaharis, 
as most did not think he was willing to say such things 
against the Pakistani government.  Some thought Karzai had 
forgotten about Kandahar and its people.  One person said he 
wished Karzai would have said such things three years ago, 
then Afghanistan would not be facing all these suicide 
bombings and terrorist attacks in Kandahar.  The province 
would be in better condition now, said a Kandahari man to a 
journalist.  Because Karzai appeared in public and went to 
several shops without having his American bodyguards with him 
as in the past, people felt he was no longer afraid to be 
among his own people.  Generally, people felt happy that 
Karzai showed he was still committed to the people and used 
tough words against Pakistan.  They also liked his 
encouraging their children to go to school and learn more and 
to never give up. 
 
Some Criticism 
-------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Not everyone was pleased with Karzai,s remarks on 
Pakistan, however.  Sayed Ishaq al Gailani, MP, echoed the 
views of others in urging Karzai and his Vice Presidents to 
travel more to bring the government to the people.  Gailani 
criticized the two deputies for not traveling at all, which 
has "really hurt the President,s image outside of Kabul". 
Gailani also was not happy that Karzai heaped "all the blame 
on Pakistan,s neck" for Afghanistan,s problems.  He pointed 
to other countries in the region that were interfering in 
Afghanistan,s internal affairs and who were promoting their 
own agenda, notably Iran.  He said that such condemnation of 
Pakistan sent a confusing signal to Afghans and to the GOP, 
given that FM Kasuri was warmly welcomed in Kabul just days 
earlier. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU) The Presidential PAG,s visit to the South 
certainly resonated with those who want to see more GOA 
presence in the region and among those who blame Pakistan for 
Afghanistan,s instability.  To sustain the much needed sense 
of presidential engagement and outreach engendered by this 
visit, we plan to work with the PAG to schedule more such 
events in the South, led by not just the President, but by 
his Ministers as well, e.g., Wardak on security and Zia on 
reconstruction and development.  We will, however, continue 
to urge the Afghans to temper public remarks critical of 
Pakistan and focus on how the two countries can work together 
to stem terrorism.
