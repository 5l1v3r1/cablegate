SUBJECT: POPE'S CALLS FOR JUST WORLD ORDER, ATTENTION TO TERRORISM, 
DARFUR 
 
 
¶1.      (U) Pope Benedict XVI used his first Christmas message to 
the city of Rome and the world (Urbi et Orbi) to focus attention 
on the threat of terrorism and the humanitarian crises around 
the world.  (Complete text of the speech was emailed to EUR/WE.) 
 With an audience of hundreds of millions via television and 
radio, the pope also drew attention to poverty, weapons 
proliferation, pandemics and the environment. 
 
¶2.      (U) Benedict XVI called for a united humanity to confront 
the "menace of terrorism."  The pontiff devoted the greater part 
of his international review to Africa, invoking God's blessing 
on all who "work for peace, integral development and the 
prevention of fratricidal conflicts."  He encouraged efforts to 
protect basic human rights in Darfur and other regions of 
central Africa.  Pope Benedict called for the resolution of 
tensions in the Middle East, including the Palestinian 
Territories, Israel and Lebanon, as well as on the Korean 
Peninsula. 
 
¶3.      (SBU) Comment.  Vatican FM officials have been pressing to 
keep Darfur on the papal agenda and will be encouraged that 
Benedict XVI used his first Urbi et Orbi message to draw 
attention once again to the situation there.  Representatives 
from the Sant'Egidio Community (involved in Darfur negotiations 
in Rome and Africa) told us December 25 that they too were 
heartened by the pope's mention of Darfur.  End comment.
