REF: SECSTATE 207709 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel points to Harold Hickman, 
Deputy Director in the Inter-American Relations Division of 
Foreign Affairs Canada.  Hickman said that Canada is 
definitely going to provide assistance to the OAS Mission to 
Colombia, and it could be substantial.  The GOC sent an 
inter-agency team to Colombia including a senior CIDA 
official, Colombia Desk Officer from FAC, and a member of the 
Stabilization and Reconstruction Task Force (START).  The 
team came back impressed by the need for cash for the OAS 
mission (he said they had around $27 in their bank account), 
and with a number of solid proposals from the Canadian 
Embassy in Bogota for viable projects. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The money will be coming from the allocation for 
START, which Hickman said is a new concept whereby Foreign 
Affairs has its own budget for such programs and does not 
have to rely on CIDA.  The proposals are awaiting an 
inter-agency decision-making process that will play out over 
the coming weeks.  Hickman said there is some urgency, as the 
money, which is substantial, must be spent before the end of 
the Canadian fiscal year on March 31.  He said he was sure it 
would be in the hundreds of thousands, and if they get what 
they are looking for, could top a million, making Canada the 
largest contributor to the OAS mission. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Hickman reiterated that some funding was a fairly 
sure thing, as the Foreign Minister made a firm commitment to 
the OAS SecGen when he was in Canada in September to assist 
the mission.  He also mentioned that Colombia's Foreign 
Minister, Carolina Barco is planning to visit Ottawa December 
1st, although the visit may not come off if the country is in 
the middle of a federal campaign.
