E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: SNAR
SUBJECT: QUARTERS LEASE FOR POLICE 
 
REFTELS: A)Quito 880, B)State 96667 
 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) NAS requests authorization to sign a two-year lease for 
administrative facilities for a specialized police intelligence 
unit of the Ecuadorian National Police that cooperates with 
DHS/ICE.  The police unit conducts operations against money 
laundering, trafficking in persons, human smuggling and other 
transnational criminal organizations.  The property is a 500-sq 
meter residential house located at Urbanizacion Mexterior, Calle 
Jose Alas 127 y Tomas Charipove in Quito, Ecuador.  The cost is USD 
1,100.00 per month and the lease term would be for two years.  This 
will be a new lease.  The lease period is from December 1, 2009 to 
November 30, 2011. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Justification:  Due to the nature of its activities, this 
police unit requires an anonymous and secure location separate from 
regular police facilities, which will permit operation of 
controlled sensitive operations.  The Ecuadorian National Police do 
not have a suitable facility available for this police unit. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) This lease replaces the lease requested in Reftel A and 
approved by INL in Reftel B.  The lease for the previous location 
was not signed, so this lease request is a replacement, rather than 
an additional location.
