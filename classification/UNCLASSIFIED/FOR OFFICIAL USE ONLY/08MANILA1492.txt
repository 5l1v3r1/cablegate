REF: STATE 64530 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Officials at the Philippine Department of Foreign 
Affairs (DFA) were pleased to receive reftel non-paper on 
June 17. Legal, Political, and Security Affairs Director 
Leah Ruiz of the DFA's Office of United Nations and 
International Organizations (UNIO) said that the Philippine 
Mission in Vienna had not sent details of the proposed 
package to Manila, so it was very helpful for Ruiz and her 
superiors. In sharing the non-paper, we underscored the USG 
view that if Iran's true goal is simply nuclear power, this 
package can make that goal a reality if Iran accepts the 
cooperation offered; we encouraged Ruiz to bear that analysis 
in mind while discussing the issue with UNIO Assistant 
Secretary Evan Garcia and UNIO Executive Director Grace 
Princesa. Ruiz confirmed June 19 that UNIO had shared the 
materials and used them in a briefing for Secretary of 
Foreign Affairs Alberto Romulo before his departure to the 
U.S.
