REF: A. ANKARA 4381 
 
     ¶B. ANKARA 4356 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on 
PKK violence in Turkey (see reftel b).  Our primary sources 
for these reports are mainstream Turkish press services, such 
as the Anatolian News Agency, and international wire 
services.  While these sources are more reliable than most 
Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  Press services sympathetic to the PKK, such 
as Neu-Isenburg People's Defense Forces and Firat News 
Agency, tend to report higher numbers of Turkish Security 
Forces casualties. 
 
¶2. (U) According to press reports, one member of the Turkish 
Security Forces was killed and nine were wounded over the 
period July 23 - July 30.  One child was killed and six 
civilians, including three children, were wounded.  One PKK 
terrorist was killed.  Police arrested 130 individuals 
attending a PKK meeting during the same period. 
 
¶3. (U) Iran, Syria, and Iraq reportedly handed over eleven 
PKK-members to Turkey during July 2006.
