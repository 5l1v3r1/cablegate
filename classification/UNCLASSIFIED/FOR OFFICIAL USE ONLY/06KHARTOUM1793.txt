SUBJECT:  SUDAN/DARFUR:  CFC Meeting in El Fasher 
¶1. (SBU) Summary and background:  On July 24, the Darfur Ceasefire 
Commission (CFC) met in El Fasher, Darfur.  Para 2 presents the 
notes of the U.S. CFC representative.  Noteworthy is that this is 
the first meeting in at least a month in which the AMIS Force 
 
Commander has participated, that the SLM/Minawi representative was 
not present for the second meeting in a row, and that a draft copy 
of the Sudanese Government's Janjaweed disarmament plan was 
circulated for discussion on July 25.  End summary and background. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The U.S. CFC representative's notes are as follows: 
The meeting convened with the Force Commander, Maj Gen Ihikire, 
chairing.  This was the first meeting he had been present for in at 
least a month. 
 
The agenda had four items: 
 
¶1.  Security of IDPs and IDP Camps 
¶2.  Plan to disarm the Janjaweed 
¶3.  Use of AMIS aircraft 
¶4.  Complaints, Violations, and Investigation Reports 
¶5.  Any other business 
 
The FC started by discussing a report of SLA (M) personnel entering 
IDP camps while carrying weapons, thus intimidating residents.  He 
said that SLA was not acting in good faith and he condemned the 
alleged actions.  The GOS rep (Brig Gen Mubarek) indicated that GoS 
had spoken to SLA (M) about the incidents and that SLA (M) would 
handle the matter.  The FC indicated that Parties who wanted to 
enter the IDP camps must check in with the nearest Mil Group Site 
(MGS) and obtain an AMIS escort before entering IDP camps. 
 
There was a request from SLA (W) rep to disclose the location of all 
IDP camps and under whose control they are, so that Parties would 
know where and who to contact.  FC took this under advisement. 
 
The FC then jumped to item three -- AMIS aircraft.  He produced a 
letter from the AMIS Deputy Head of Mission, announcing to all 
Parties that AMIS aircraft can only be used for operational AMIS 
purposes.  He continued by stating that DPA implementation 
organizations should/will have their own budgets, logistical 
arrangements, etc., and that these organizations would have to 
support their own activities. 
 
Before this issue could be discussed, the FC interjected that he 
just noticed that the EU rep, Brig Gen Pitty, and the SLA (M) rep 
were not present.  After some bluster, the FC recessed the meeting 
for one hour in order to locate both reps. 
 
The meeting reconvened one hour later with BG Pitty joining, but the 
SLA (M) rep still absent.  The FC was perturbed and said that the 
meeting could not continue without all Parties present.  The FC was 
asked about the status of the two remaining agenda items 
(Disarmament of JJW and Violations).  After some suggestions by the 
UN Observer, the FC agreed to distribute to the commission a draft 
copy of the GoS plan for disarmament of the Janjaweed. 
 
The FC said that we would have to provide comments by Wednesday 
(tomorrow) at 0930, since there is a partner meeting scheduled for 
tomorrow at 1600 to discuss the draft.  The draft supposedly has 
been sitting on the FC's desk for some time, but no one would touch 
it in his absence. 
 
As for violation reports -- the FC refused to discuss this at all, 
without SLA (M) present. 
 
The FC adjourned the meeting at 12:45. 
 
Next CFC meeting is scheduled for 0930 Wednesday, 26 Jul, with 
discussion of draft JJW disarmament on the agenda. 
 
Note:  The SLA (M) representative reportedly has not attended the 
last two CFC meetings -- this is problematic, as the FC is using it 
as a reason to NOT discuss any violations.  Post suggests that the 
SLA (M) group currently in the U.S. for meetings be reminded that 
they have a serious obligation to participate in the CFC -- perhaps 
Washington delivering the message will give it a boost.  Without all 
Parties' participation in the CFC, there will continue to be a lack 
of progress.
