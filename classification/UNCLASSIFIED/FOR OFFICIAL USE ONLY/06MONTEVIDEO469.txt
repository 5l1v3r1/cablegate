(SBU) On May 25, P/E Counselor delivered reftel demarche to 
the MFA's Director of Multilateral Affairs Gustavo Alvarez, 
stressing that the USG attached great importance to the 
issues contained as they relate to the future effective 
functioning of the UN.  Alvarez listened attentively, and 
said the points would be carefully considered.  He opined 
that a consensus-based solution would best reflect the 
commitments made by leaders at last September's World Summit 
in New York.  He added that Uruguay's diplomatic mission in 
Malaysia was "very modest" and indicated that he was not sure 
whether or not a GOU representative would be attending the 
upcoming May 27-29 Non-Aligned Movement's ministerial 
meeting.
