¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Gaza's Kerem Shalom crossing was open on 
November 17 for limited food and humanitarian shipments for 
the first time since November 4, while Nahal Oz fuel transfer 
station remains closed.  At least 14 rockets have been fired 
from Gaza November 16-17.  The Gaza power plant has been shut 
down since November 13 due to a lack of fuel.  OCHA contacts 
report that basic food supplies are sufficient for the near 
future, despite the lack of UNRWA food handouts, though 
prices are rising.  End summary. 
 
Limited Amounts of Food and Medicine Allowed 
through Kerem Shalom;  Nahal Oz Fuel Station Closed 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) UN contacts report that 12 truckloads of commercial 
food and 21 truckloads of WFP, UNRWA, and Red Cross 
humanitarian shipments entered via Kerem Shalom crossing on 
November 17.  Erez crossing was open for international NGO 
employees on November 17.  The food and humanitarian 
shipments are the first to enter Gaza since November 4. 
(Note:  Prior to the flare-up of violence, around 75 
truckloads/day of commercial food and humanitarian shipments 
entered Gaza via Kerem Shalom.  End note.)  Nahal Oz fuel 
transfer station remains closed and ConGen contacts report 
that most fuel supplies are nearly diminished.  The Gaza 
power plant has been shut down since November 13 due to a 
lack of industrial fuel. 
 
Blackouts Are Gazans' Most Immediate Concern 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) UN OCHA officials in Gaza said on November 17 that 
electricity blackouts remain the most pressing issue for 
Gazans, as most homes have running water for just a few hours 
each day and much food has spoiled due to the lack of 
refrigeration.  Gaza water and sanitation contacts said on 
November 17 that the pumps of the municipal sewage system are 
receiving just 8-16 hours/day of electricity from the grid. 
Emergency generators at those pumps have limited diesel fuel 
supplies and many are not operational due to a lack 
replacement parts.  The lack of power and spare parts have 
caused sewage pipes to back-up and around 65,000 cubic 
meters/day of mostly untreated sewage flow into the sea, 
according to our contacts.  They noted that around 40,000 
cubic meters/day of mostly treated sewage flowed into the sea 
prior to June 2007.  OCHA contacts report that basic food 
supplies are sufficient for the near future, despite the lack 
of UNRWA food handouts, though prices are rising. 
 
Violence continues on November 16-17 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) ConGen contacts confirm press reports that at least 
14 rockets were fired toward Israel November 16-17, with at 
least 10 landing inside Israel.  One Israeli was injured in a 
rocket attack in Sderot on November 16, and an IAF airstrike 
killed four Popular Resistance Committee militants in 
Shujai,ya, Gaza City, on November 16, according to press 
reports.
