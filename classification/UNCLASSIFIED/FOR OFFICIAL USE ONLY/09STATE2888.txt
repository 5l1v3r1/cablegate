SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 05-1000934 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-5. 
 
¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests posts' assistance in conducting 
 post-shipment end-use checks on license 05-1000934 for the 
export of aircraft parts to Brazil. Posts are requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to this Blue Lantern inquiry will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Reason for request: Commodities are in demand by 
countries, including one in the region, that are subject to 
U.S. arms embargoes and proscribed as end-use destinations 
under Section 126.1 of the International Traffic in Arms 
Regulations (ITAR); routing of commodities raises possible 
diversion concerns. 
 
¶4. (U) ACTION MADRID: Post should make appropriate inquiries 
to determine if foreign consignee EADS CASA both received the 
aircraft parts listed on license 05-1000934 and exported them 
to end-user the Brazilian Air Force.  If possible, post 
should obtain relevant identifying information in order to 
facilitate Embassy Brasilia's efforts to confirm ultimate 
receipt of the parts by the Brazilian Air Force. 
 
¶5. (U) ACTION BRASILIA: Post should make appropriate 
inquiries to determine if the end-user, the Brazilian Air 
Force, received the aircraft parts listed on license 
05-1000934 from Spanish consignee EADS CASA and that these 
United States Munitions List (USML) items are being used for 
the purpose stated on the license.  End action.
