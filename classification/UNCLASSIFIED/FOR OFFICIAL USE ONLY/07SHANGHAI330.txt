(U) This cable is sensitive but unclassified and for official 
use only.  Not for distribution outside of USG channels. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  At a meeting with visiting Embassy Finatt on 
May 16, HSBC China Deputy CEO Bryan Stiles and Global Markets 
Managing Director David Liao said HSBC's local incorporation had 
gone smoothly.  HSBC believed that Chinese regulators would soon 
allow foreign banks to offer retail RMB customers debit cards. 
Removing regulatory obstacles would not necessarily allow 
foreign banks to expand more quickly, given the scarcity of 
qualified staff.  HSBC hoped that China soon would allow all 
banks to hold net open positions shorting the dollar rather than 
giving one bank (Tianjin Commercial Bank) a competitive 
advantage by allowing only it to do so.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Local Incorporation Smooth; CBRC Responsive 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a meeting on May 16, HSBC's Stiles and Liao told 
visiting Embassy Finatt that HSBC's local incorporation in China 
had gone "very smoothly."  Stiles said that the China Banking 
and Regulatory Commission (CBRC) had been especially responsive 
in working out the "significant finer details."  In fact, said 
Stiles, it was "incredible" that China had managed to 
incorporate four major banks in one year.  He attributed this to 
all sides -- both the banks and CBRC -- wanting the process to 
succeed. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Though locally-incorporated foreign banks were now able 
to take RMB deposits, the CBRC had not yet allowed them to issue 
debit cards to their customers to access their accounts.  Stiles 
felt that this was "a relatively small speed bump" and expressed 
his confidence that this would be resolved within three months. 
(Note: During the subsequent May 22-23 Strategic Economic 
Dialogue discussions in Washington, DC, the Chinese government 
agreed to allow foreign incorporated banks qualified for RMB 
retail businesses to issue RMB bank cards which meet the 
operational and technical standards of China's banking cards, 
and enjoy the same treatment as Chinese banks.  End note.) 
 
----------------------------------------- 
HSBC Struggling To Expand at Pace Allowed 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) While USG officials often focused on regulatory 
obstacles, Stiles stressed that recruiting, training and 
retaining qualified staff was as important a factor in 
constraining growth by foreign banks (Ref A).  Stiles said that 
HSBC had opened branches in western and central China in order 
to receive CBRC blessing to open new branches in economically 
more-vibrant areas.  "Some cities that we have opened branches 
in, we wouldn't actually have planned to be there for 15 years," 
he added. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Opening Up Means More Chance to Regulate 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Stiles suggested that the USG message to China on 
capital account liberalization should be that bringing informal 
sector activities into the formal sector would improve 
regulation and oversight. Stiles said that the hot flows of 
foreign currency already coming into China to take advantage of 
the expected RMB appreciation was one area that could be 
addressed by lifting the quota caps on the Qualified Foreign 
Institutional Investor (QFII) program.

HSBC FOREX Traders Gaming the System

¶6. (SBU) HSBC's Liao commented that the China Foreign Exchange 
Trading System (CFETS) much-vaunted new trading software 
platform (Ref B) was "not at all user-friendly."  The worst 
aspect of the new software was that the price shown on the 
trading screen was only an "indicative" price and not binding 
for a trade.  Once a trader decided to make a trade, he or she 
had to call up to find out what the actual price was.  Liao 
described how HSBC traders had attempted to use this feature to 
their benefit, saying that it was like "kids with a new computer 
game."  (Note:  In a separate conversation on May 14 with 
Pol/Econ Chief, JP Morgan Greater China General Manager Andrew 
Zhang explained how JP Morgan had to work through a broker with 
access to Reuters to find out the actual prices being offered 
and then confirm trades by phone, sending other business to the 
broker to compensate for the fact that JP Morgan couldn't pay 
for the "informal" services being provided that were supposed to 
be provided by CFETS.  Zhang planned to raise the issue with 
CFETS President Xie Duo.  End note.) 
 
¶7. (SBU) HSBC's Liao said that the next step necessary in 
creating a more liquid foreign exchange market was to allow 
banks to take a short position on the dollar.  In an unwritten 
rule, banks were allowed a five day average in longing and 
shorting the dollar -- but if the average reflected a net short 
position the bank would be fined.  Liao said that the one bank 
in Tianjin that was permitted to short the dollar, Tianjin 
Commercial Bank, was "enjoying it very much."  It would be 
preferable if CFETS could allow every bank to take a short 
dollar position, even if subject to strict limits, he suggested. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Foreign Debt Restrictions Not Slowing HSBC's Growth 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶8. (SBU) According to Liao, recent CBRC rules restricting banks' 
access to foreign debt did not make any sense.  While one reason 
for this policy was to limit banks' ability to borrow in dollars 
and short the dollar to speculate on RMB appreciation, Liao said 
that there was no way that HSBC could convert borrowed foreign 
currency into RMB without getting approval from the State 
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).  According to Liao, 
given HSBC's large branch network relative to foreign 
competitors, it had ample access to RMB for the time being and 
thus the reduced quota for foreign debt would not yet limit its 
ability to expand its loan portfolio. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Comment: As has been the case in prior meetings with 
HSBC executives, the general view is that China's progress and 
pace of banking reform is appropriate and HSBC continues to be 
well-positioned in the market, in part due to benefits it 
derives as a foreign bank able to benefit from the Closer 
Economic Partnership Agreement with Hong Kong.  Unlike some of 
their counterparts at American banks, HSBC very clearly does not 
want to rock the boat.
