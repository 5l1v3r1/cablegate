REF: STATE 40595 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Poloff discussed reftel impact of the Independent 
Inquiry Committee (IIC) charged with investiging the UN's 
Oil-for Food program on April 27 with MFA Director for 
International Organizations and UN Affairs Nasser Bourita. 
According to Bourita, the issue needs to be viewed 
"globally," and not solely as a problem of the Secretariat. 
However, what is most important, asserted Bourita, is to take 
the lessons learned from the investigation to try to improve 
the system.   Now that the UN Secretary General has proposed 
new measures and corrections are being made, it will be 
important to ensure that this situation never happens again.
