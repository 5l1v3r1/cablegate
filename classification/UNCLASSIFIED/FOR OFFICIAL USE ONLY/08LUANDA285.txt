REF: A. LUANDA 263 
 
     ¶B. LUANDA 254 
 
¶1. (SBU) The DCM raised USG concerns over the delay in 
releasing the official results of Zimbabwe's presidential 
election during an April 9 meeting with the Ministry of 
Foreign Relations Director for American Affairs, Balbina Da 
Silva.  The DCM also expressed USG hopes that violence can be 
avoided in Zimbabwe and asked Angola to take the  necessary 
steps within SADC to diffuse the current situation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Da Silva replied that Angola is also concerned about 
the possibility of violence.  She added that SADC countries 
had agreed yesterday (she did not specify the forum) to urge 
the Zimbabwean government to release the final election 
results.  She said the SADC countries would not take any 
public stance, but would pressure Zimbabwe privately.
