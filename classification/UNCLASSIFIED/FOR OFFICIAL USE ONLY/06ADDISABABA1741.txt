¶1. (SBU) Summary.  A/S Frazer met June 23 with Ethiopia-based 
representatives of Intergovernmental Authority on Development 
(IGAD) member states.  The Kenyan and Somali Ambassadors 
argued that membership in the International Somalia Contact 
Group (SCG) should have been cast a bit wider to include IGAD 
member states.  Ethiopia's Ambassador to the AU added that 
the distinction between member and observer was "awkward." 
Some reps questioned the real impact of the arms embargo, 
while the Somali Ambassador said it was a roadblock to the 
TFG's legitimacy.  With regard to Darfur, the Sudanese 
Ambassador said the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) was 
incomplete because some parties had refused to sign it and 
intimated the GOS had compromised enough on the matter.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) A/S Frazer met June 23 with Ambassadors from IGAD 
member states.  Participants included Kenyan Ambassador 
Franklin Esipila, Sudanese Ambassador Abuzeid El-Hassan, 
Djiboutian Ambassador Ibrahim Kamil, TFG Ambassador Abdikarin 
Farah, Ugandan Charge Idul Amoko, and Ethiopia's Ambassador 
to the African Union Sahilework Zewdie.  United Kingdom 
Charge Deborah Fisher, UK Special Envoy for Darfur Rod 
Pullen, and Spanish Ambassador Carmen de la Pena Coruera also 
participated.  Frazer was accompanied by Charge Vicki 
Huddleston, A/DCM Brian Moran, Special Assistant Kendra 
Gaither, Eritrea and Somalia Desk Officer Nole Garey, 
CJTF-HOA Commander Rear Admiral Richard Hunt, Lt. Commander 
Michael Sowa, Political/Economic Counselor and poloff. 
 
SOMALIA:  EXPAND SCG, SUPPORT TFG AND LIFT ARMS EMBARGO 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) A/S Frazer explained that the SCG was formed with 
the intention of sharing information and coordinating policy 
on Somklia.  Frazer emphasized the SCG was not meant to 
replace IGAD, but rather to build consensus on how to 
preserve regional stability, support the TFG, address 
humanitarian assistance needs and combat terrorism.  TFG 
Ambassador Farah questioned the decision not to include any 
IGAD states in the SCG, arguing that the TFG was the "baby" 
of IGAD.  Kenyan Ambassador Esipila concurred with Farah and 
went on to criticize the distinction between SCG member and 
observer entities.  It was a mistake in his opinion to 
designate observers as it gave the impression the AU, IGAD 
were "fence sitters" and not able to take part in the 
decision-making process.  Ethiopia's Ambassador to the AU 
Sahilework noted that the AU's observer label was "awkward" 
for the organization.  Frazer said that there was no 
substantial difference between member and observer entities 
and that all stakeholders were treated equally.  She 
nonetheless indicated that she would recommend that the 
formal distinction between observers and members be dropped 
before the next SCG meeting in Sweden. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Sudanese Ambassador Abuzeid El-Hassan asked A/S 
Frazer about the USG view on the agreement reached between 
the TFG and UIC.  Frazer noted that while she did not have 
all of the details, the agreement was a step in the right 
direction.  The international community had called on the TFG 
and UIC to open a dialogue, and in Khartoum the process had 
begun.  Frazer told the group she looked forward to the sides 
reconvening on July 15 and reiterated the USG's support of 
the TFG.  Ambassador Farah told Frazer that America's 
commitment to Somalia had never been questioned by the Somali 
people.  He noted that Somalis remembered the U.S. loss of 
life in 1993 and respected the U.S.' sacrifice.  Now the U.S. 
must again take the lead role in role in resolving the 
current conflict, he said. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Kenyan Ambassador Esipila stated that the existing 
arms embargo limited the effectiveness and overall legitimacy 
of the TFG.  He added there were no mechanisms in place to 
enforce the embargo.  Farah contended that Somalia has more 
weapons than most other countries, but "they happen to be in 
the wrong hands."  He told Frazer most Somalis see the 
embargo as irrelevant because the country is awash in arms. 
With the longest coast in Africa, an arms embargo was 
impossible to enforce.  Farah asked that the USG reconsider 
the embargo.  Frazer explained that the U.S. was considering 
options with regard to the embargo and reiterated her 
dedication to strengthening the TFG. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ambassador Carmen de la Pena Coruera asked Frazer

how the SCG would approach humanitarian assistance. 
Ambassador Farah added that most assistance has been 
mistakenly focused in Mogadishu where "less than one percent" 
of the population live and recommended that the international 
community and neighboring countries focus on areas of greater 
need within the country.  Frazer indicated that the SCG was 
working diligently to mobilize humanitarian assistance for 
the country.  She noted that aid was still flowing to 
Mogadishu and there were signs from the UIC that it would not 
impede assistance.  The issue, Frazer explained, was not 
access, but rather whether or not the money and goods would 
keep flowing to the country. 
 
DARFUR: GOS STANCE ON UN MISSION DISAPPOINTING 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶7. (SBU)  Sudanese Ambassador El-Hassan said the DPA was 
incomplete because some parties had refused to sign it.  He 
added that durable peace was only possible if all parties 
compromised and that pressure to do so was required. 
El-Hassan said, "we have negotiated enough."  UK Special 
Envoy for Darfur Rod Pullen told El-Hassan that the DPA has 
an "extraordinary" amount of international support and 
credited the GOS for its commitment.  Pullen said that action 
was necessary to show the people in the region how they will 
benefit, increase safety and security, and begin the process 
of rebuilding lives.  Frazer explained that inclusiveness was 
key to producing an on-going productive dialogue and added 
that non-signatories to the DPA should be pressured or 
provided incentives to become part of the process.  Frazer 
said she was disappointed with recent GOS statements 
regarding the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) to UN 
mission transition as well as United Nations Undersecretary 
General Jean-Marie Guehenno's decision to move the transition 
from the originally planned September 2006 to January 2007. 
She questioned how the gap would be filled as AMIS soldiers' 
pay was currently three months in arrears.
