¶1. (SBU) Dear Director Tschetter, I would like to thank you for your 
swift and positive response regarding a Peace Corps program in 
Indonesia. Indonesia's burgeoning democracy, majority-Muslim 
demographics, and genuine developmental need are indeed worth a 
second look. 
¶2. (SBU) We would be delighted to host the Safety and Security Team 
and welcome Mr. Patrick Hogan and Ms. Maria Cadet to Indonesia. I 
encourage them to contact Mr. Jonathan Alan in our Economic Section 
at their earliest convenience. He can be reached at (62-21)3435-9067 
or AlanJA@state.gov. We would like to discuss the possibility of 
alternate dates due to my travel schedule. 
¶3. (SBU) I appreciate your consideration and look forward to the 
Safety and Security Team review. I am confident the Peace Corps can 
be successful in Indonesia and we welcome the opportunity to assist 
the review team in every way possible.
