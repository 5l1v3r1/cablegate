¶1. (SBU) Summary: The MFA is in charge of preparing the 
political ground for Vietnam's eventual participation in 
international peacekeeping operations, which means winning 
internal consensus and gaining public opinion support. 
Neither task is complete yet, and the internal consensus- 
building will not be possible until Vietnam's new leadership 
slate is in place, which will not happen before June. 
Vietnam will thus be unable to make a Darfur PKO 
contribution commitment before the April 24 deadline.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) One day after informing the Embassy that a meeting 
"would not be possible now" on the subject of possible 
Vietnamese support for a Darfur PKO mission (reftels), the 
MFA invited Poloff to discuss the subject with International 
Organizations Department Section Chief Pham Vinh Quang. 
Poloff presented Ref B demarche, which Quang characterized 
as "encouraging."  "The U.S. commitment to Darfur is good to 
hear," Quang said. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Unfortunately, Quang said, Vietnam will probably 
not make the April 24 deadline to commit troops or equipment 
for the UN force.  "We are still in the stage of collecting 
information and discussing it within the Government," he 
explained.  "This is a political decision that will be made 
at the very top, and will require consensus among all of the 
major foreign policy officials." 
 
¶4. (SBU) In theory, Quang continued, Vietnam is already 
committed to the idea of contributing something to one or 
more international peacekeeping operations.  "After some 
years of stability, Vietnam is ready to make a greater 
contribution internationally.  This is linked to our desire 
to serve as a nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council 
beginning in 2008."  Vietnam will start modestly, he 
predicted, with "observers, a military medical team or a 
demining team."  For now, however, Vietnam is still 
collecting information and building internal consensus. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The GVN also has to take public opinion into 
account, he said.  The only modern Vietnamese experience 
with sending troops internationally was the 1978 invasion of 
Cambodia (or, as Quang put it, "Vietnam's period of 
assistance to its Cambodian brothers").  Public opinion is 
still not positive about that effort, he said.  The GVN does 
not want to risk casualties, and so there needs to be 
"careful preparation" both militarily and politically.  The 
MFA, with Vice Foreign Minister Le Van Bang as the lead 
official, is in charge of political preparation, including 
winning internal support.  The Ministry of Defense is in 
charge of physically preparing the troops for an overseas 
deployment. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Quang apologized that the desired April 24 deadline 
will not be possible to meet.  "We have not finished the 
preparation," he explained, "and the final decisionmakers 
will be the leaders chosen and ratified by the 10th Party 
Congress in April and the National Assembly in May and June. 
We cannot expect an answer before then."
