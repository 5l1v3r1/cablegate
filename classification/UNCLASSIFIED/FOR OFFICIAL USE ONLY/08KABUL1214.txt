THE CROSSROADS - A FUTURE WITHOUT VIOLENT RADICALIZATION 
 
REF: A. 08 STATE 46958

¶1. (U) This is an action request.  See paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. (U) The Afghan Ministry of Education nominated Kabul 
University Acting Chancellor Professor Mokamel Alkozai to 
participate in the UNESCO conference in Bahrain June 15-17: 
Youth at the Crossroads - A Future without Violent 
Radicalization (REF A).  Given continuing reports that 
extremists are recruiting on the Kabul University campus, we 
strongly support his attendance.  We believe it would be in 
the USG's interest to have a well-placed Kabul University 
campus official participate in a solutions-oriented, best 
practices conference. 
 
¶3. (U) The Afghan Government does not have the money to send 
Professor Alkozai to the conference.  We request the 
Department consider funding Professor Alkozai's travel and 
accommodation expenses.
