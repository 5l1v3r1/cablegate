SUBJECT: JCIC-DIP-09-002: PROVISION IN ADVANCE OF DATA ON 
THE LV-2 SPACE LAUNCH VEHICLE 
 
¶1.  (SBU) This is an action request.  See paragraph 4 below. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Background:  In Joint Compliance and Inspection 
Commission (JCIC) Joint Statement Number 21, the parties 
are obligated to provide, "in advance,[?] information on 
ICBMs and SLBMs used to deliver objects into the upper 
atmosphere or space, including space launch vehicles that 
incorporate the first stage of an ICBM or SLBM.  Such 
information shall include technical data, development 
plans, and photographs or, until such ICBMs and SLBMs, 
including such space launch vehicles, are available to be 
photographed, schematic drawings."  JCIC Joint Statement 
Number 31 specifies the minimum information that shall be 
provided pursuant to the aforementioned obligation 
contained in JCIC Joint Statement Number 21. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The United States has plans to conduct the first 
launch of a new space launch vehicle (SLV), designated the 
LV-2.  The LV-2 SLV incorporates the first stage of a 
Trident I SLBM and will be assembled at the Courtland 
Missile Assembly Facility, Alabama.  Joint Statement 31 
specifies that SLV data shall be provided no later than 10 
days prior to the first time the SLV is assembled at a 
facility other than a production facility, including a 
space launch facility.  As we move forward with decisions 
on the issue of Missile Defense, particularly in the area 
of testing, it is important to frame necessary steps not 
only as needed required in the context of Treaty 
requirements but also in the context of our overall 
bilateral relations with Russia. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Action Request: Embassies Moscow, Kyiv, and Astana 
are requested to provide the text contained in paragraph 6 
below to appropriate host government officials in the form 
of a non-paper, not later than April 27, 2009.  Washington 
will provide each embassy a courtesy Russian-language 
translation of the paper.  An associated schematic drawing 
of the LV-2 SLV will be emailed to capitals separately, 
and should be provided to these officials at the same 
time.  Washington requests that each embassy confirm 
delivery of this paper, the name and office of the 
official to whom it was delivered, the date of delivery, 
and any comment or reaction provided at that time. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The text in paragraph 6 and the associated 
schematic drawing will be sent directly to the Belarusian 
Government via a service message transmitted by the U.S. 
Nuclear Risk Reduction Center. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Begin text of paper: 
 
Development Plan for the Launch Vehicle-2 (LV-2) Space 
Launch Vehicle (SLV) that Incorporates the First Stage of 
a Trident I SLBM 
 
The Lockheed-Martin Corporation, under a contract with the 
United States government, will provide launch and 
technical support for the operation of the LV-2 space 
launch vehicle.  The initial use of the LV-2 space launch 
vehicle will be as a target vehicle for testing of the 
U.S. ballistic missile defense system, and other uses 
consistent with the START Treaty are possible.  The LV-2 
space launch vehicle has two stages and an assembled 
length of 10.1 meters.  The LV-2 space launch vehicle will 
be assembled at the Courtland Missile Assembly Facility, 
Alabama.  The LV-2 space launch vehicle will be launched 
from a soft site launcher located at space launch 
facilities declared under the START Treaty.  An associated 
schematic drawing of the LV-2 space launch vehicle is 
attached to this paper. 
 
Technical data for the LV-2 space launch vehicle that 
incorporates a first stage of a Trident I SLBM: 
 
¶A. Name or designation of the space launch vehicle: Launch 
Vehicle-2 (LV-2) 
 
¶B. Type of ICBM or SLBM whose first stage is incorporated 
into the space launch vehicle: Trident I SLBM
