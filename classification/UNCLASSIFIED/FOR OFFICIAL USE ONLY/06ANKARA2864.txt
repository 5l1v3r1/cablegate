¶1. (SBU) Summary: Parliamentary elections in Turkey are 
constitutionally mandated to be held at least once every five 
years.  No legislative term has lasted the full five years 
since 1980.  Current political debate centers in part on 
whether or not early elections will be called before their 
scheduled date in November 2007 (reftels).  In practice, it 
takes three to four months from the time the parliament or 
president triggers elections to the actual election date. 
While by-elections may not be held within one year of 
scheduled general elections, there is no such restriction on 
calling early general elections.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Under the Turkish Constitution, general parliamentary 
elections can be held under three conditions: 
 
-- At the expiration of the constitutionally-mandated 
five-year legislative term; 
 
-- When the parliament votes to hold early elections; or 
 
-- When the president, under limited circumstances, calls for 
early elections. 
 
When Parliament Triggers Elections 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) For parliament to take action, either a draft law 
announcing an election date or such language attached to 
another draft law must be introduced.  Either the government 
or opposition can introduce the legislation.  Passage of the 
draft law requires that (a) a quorum of one third of the 
parliament (184 out of 550 seats) be present to begin the 
session, and (b) one-fourth of the parliament vote in favor 
(138 out of 550 seats). 
 
When the President Triggers Elections 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) The president, after consulting with the parliament 
speaker, can take an early election decision under only the 
following five circumstances: 
 
-- If a government cannot be formed within 45 days of a 
general election; 
 
-- If a government cannot be formed within 45 days of the 
resignation of the prime minister; 
 
-- If a government falls following a vote of no confidence 
and a new government cannot be established or fails to win a 
vote of confidence within 45 days.  (A vote of no confidence 
requires a quorum of 184 to begin the session; but a majority 
of all members of parliament must then vote in favor - 226 
out of 550 votes); 
 
-- If the prime minister asks for a vote of confidence, the 
request to hold such a vote is turned down by an absolute 
majority vote of all members (226 out of 550 votes) and a 
government cannot be formed within 45 days; 
 
-- If a newly formed government cannot win a vote of 
confidence. 
 
¶5. (U) The constitution and electoral law do not specify a 
timeline that must be followed once elections are called. 
The Supreme Elections Board (SEB), a body of 11 judges, 
publishes an elections calendar that specifies several 
procedures with deadlines, such as finalizing candidate 
lists, publicizing voters lists, printing the ballot papers 
and the official campaign period.  According to past 
experience, approximately three to four months elapse between 
an election call and election day.  In 2002, for example, the 
elections calendar, published one week after early elections 
were called, covered a three-month period, from August 7 to 
November 3, 2002. 
 
By-Elections 
 
ANKARA 00002864  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
------------ 
 
¶6. (U) By-elections are called when 5 percent of the seats in 
parliament (26 seats) are vacated or if a province no longer 
has parliamentary representation.  Elections must be held 
within three months of this occurrence.  By-elections may 
not/not be held within one year of scheduled general 
elections.  No such restriction is placed on general 
elections, which may be called at any time.
