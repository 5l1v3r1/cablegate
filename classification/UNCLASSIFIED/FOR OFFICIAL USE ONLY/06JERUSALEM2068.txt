SUBJECT: LIVELIHOOD OF GAZA FISHERMEN THREATENED 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) According to an April World Food Programme (WFP) 
report, local demand for fish in Gaza has doubled and put 
pressure on Gaza fishing grounds, already restricted to 6 
nautical miles from the shore.  (Note: The Oslo Accords 
designated 20 miles of fishing grounds for Palestinians in 
Gaza.  End Note.)  Fish catch dropped from 8 metric tons per 
day in 2005 to 4.2 metric tons per day in 2006.  WFP warned 
that if the fishing grounds are not expanded to at least 12 
miles from the shore, the fishing industry could disappear by 
October 2007, impacting 35,000 Gazans who work in the 
industry and depriving Gazans of an important source of 
protein. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Executive Director of Al-Tawfiq Fishermen's 
Cooperative Mohammad Zaqout told EconOffs that the fishermen 
do not have the resources or the ability to meet the higher 
demand for fish primarily due to limited fishing grounds. 
Zaqout said the GOI had extended the fishing area to 10 
nautical miles from the shore when President Abbas was 
elected in 2005, but limited it to 6 nautical miles after 
Hamas took over the government in March.  As a result, Zaqout 
said 3,500 fishermen could only catch about 2 to 3 metric 
tons of fish per day. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Zaqout said that Gaza fishermen lacked the money to 
repair their boats and nets.  Although some NGOs had provided 
assistance in the past, the Intifada had forced NGOs to 
revise their assistance priorities in light of changing 
humanitarian needs.  CARE Gaza staff member told EconOff that 
CARE had provided some technical assistance and had taken a 
leading role in encouraging the fishermen to advocate for 
their rights.  The Welfare Association, a private, non-profit 
foundation channeling assistance from the Palestinian 
diaspora to local NGOs, had provided fishermen with ice and 
nets in the last few years.  (Note: USAID has not previously 
provided assistance to fishermen in Gaza.  End Note.) 
Without equipment such as fishing nets, fuel, and lighting 
equipment, fishermen in Gaza would be unable to continue to 
fish, Zaqout said.  He added that other related industries, 
such as boat construction, would suffer if the fishing 
industry collapsed.
