EVACUATIONS/AMERICAN CITIZEN ISSUES 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) Two hundred fourteen American evacuees and family 
members have departed Port-au-Prince since February 5 at 2000 
EST; a total of 15,491 have been evacuated to date.  A total 
of 22,500 potential evacuees have been accounted for.  There

au-Prince e-mail) 
 
¶4. (SBU) As of 1200 EST February 6, there are 77 confirmed 
American citizen fatalities, with another 28 American citizen 
deaths reported.  (TF1/Embassy Port-au-Prince e-mail) 
 
¶5. (U) Former President Clinton urged the Haitian and U.S. 
governments to resolve the case of 10 American citizens 
accused of trying to take children illegally out of Haiti. 
 (Reuters) 
 
¶6. (U) A lawyer representing the 10 American citizens told 
the press his clients did not receive conditional release. 
The men will be held at the national prison, and the women at 
Petionville women's prison.  (AFP) 
 
¶7. (SBU) PM Bellerive approved a list of 17 adoptees for 
departure February 5; another list of 54 adoptees awaits the 
PM's review.  The Embassy plans to present a consolidated 
list of pending cases early next week to streamline the

HUMANITARIAN UPDATE 
------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) NGOs distributed food at all 16 distribution sites 
in Port-au-Prince February 5 without incident. 
 (TF1/Interagency Conference Call) 
 
¶10. (SBU) WFP and NGOs will adjust aid levels at food

rural communities.  (USAID/DCHA Haiti Fact Sheet #24)

cross into the Dominican Republic via the Jimani border 
crossing point daily.  (USAID/DCHA Haiti Fact Sheet #24) 
 
¶14. (U) Haitians who fled the capital are starting to return.

accept a small number of Haitian patients and offered to 
increase its MINUSTAH contingent in Haiti from 27 to 35. 
(Bogota 167)
