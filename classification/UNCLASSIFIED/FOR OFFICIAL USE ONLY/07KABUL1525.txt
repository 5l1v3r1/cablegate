SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) OPIC President and CEO Robert Mosbacher came to Kabul on 21 
April to accompany Dole CEO David Murdock and to examine potential 
investments in Afghanistan.  The visit coincided with the first, 
US-assisted Afghan AgFair for agricultural buyers. When Mosbacher 
left on 23 April, he had not only discussed agri-business 
investment, but also closed a land lease for a new $80 million 
Marriott hotel in Kabul; presented a potential expedited equipment 
purchase proposal for the Kabul electricity initiative to add 100 MW 
of power generation; and discussed energy, mining, carpets, and 
trucking investments, access to credit, and other projects in 
meetings with GoA officials and private businessmen.  Ambassador 
Wood and Mosbacher used a key meeting with President Karzai to break 
a log-jam on the hotel deal. (Murdock visit was reported via Ref B.) 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Embassy arranged a program of senior government and private 
sector meetings from April 21-23 for Robert Mosbacher, President and 
CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).  OPIC 
Chief of Staff Dulce Zahniser traveled with Mr. Mosbacher.  The OPIC 
team timed their visit to accompany Dole CEO David Murdock and 
coincide with the Ministry of AgricultureQs US-assisted AgFair, a 
three-day event for agricultural buyers, sellers and organizations. 
(Murdock visit was reported via Ref B.) 
 
--------------------- 
Marriott Lease Signed 
--------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Marriott deal was signed in a public ceremony on 23 
April with Minister of Commerce and Industry Farhang.  The lease 
between the GoA and TAYL Investors Group will pave the way for 
building an $80 million Marriott hotel on a parcel of land adjacent 
to the Embassy, on the main road between downtown Kabul and the 
airport.  The lease agreement had been hung up on a demand by the 
Afghan MFA, one of the parcelQs owners and the lead negotiator for 
the GoA, for a five-room set-aside for the benefit of the MFA.  The 
room set-aside benefit had been agreed to in the long-defunct 
December 2003 land lease agreement between the GoA and a previous 
group of investors who wanted to build a Hyatt Hotel on the same 
location. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In coordination with OPIC, Embassy had laid groundwork for 
the lease deal with key members of the GoA High Commission on 
Investment.  With the exception of the MFA, we had developed a 
consensus among other HIG members on an alternative concession to 
the GoA proposed by the developers (a 25 percent across-the-board 
discount for all GoA employees).  In advance of the visit, the issue 
was teed up with the Commerce Minister, and bolstered with a 
Mosbacher to President Karzai letter, with the aim of leveraging the 
visit to close the deal. 
 
¶5. (SBU) To tip the scale, Ambassador Wood and Mosbacher (and 
Murdock) met with President Karzai on April 22.  During the Karzai 
meeting, Mosbacher and the Ambassador were able to press for prompt 
resolution to secure the hotel deal and signal to investors that 
Afghanistan is open to business.  The Embassy arranged an immediate 
follow-on meeting with Minister of Commerce and Industry Farhang to 
finalize lease arrangements and the approval process within the GoA. 
 With strong support from Karzai, and active engagement of the 
Ministries of Commerce and Finance, and the Afghan Investment 
Support Agency (AISA), the Government was able to arrange a special 
High Commission on Investment meeting during the visit to secure 
final GOA authorization of the lease agreement (copies provided to

OPIC, SCA/A, and EB/OIA.)

Bringing Power to Kabul 
----------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) On enhancing electricity supply in Kabul by 100 MW -- a 
priority issue for us and the GOA -- Mosbacher unveiled a proposal 
from a leading generator manufacturer for an expedited delivery and 
installation schedule for new diesel/HFO-fueled generator capacity. 
Minister of Economy Shams expressed strong interest because of the 
long waiting lines and production schedules for new generators. 
Mosbacher was able to get a promise of delivery of an initial 30 MW 
package through his contacts with the CEO of the manufacturer. 
Under this proposal, the initial 30 MW of capacity would be on-line 
months sooner with a good likelihood of the 100 MW being in place by 
the winter of 2008-2009.  (Note: Subsequently we have learned that 
other manufacturers/vendors may be able to match the expedited 
delivery schedule proposal that Mosbacher brought.  This allows us 
to conduct a competitive procurement for which a Request For 
Proposal for 100 MW of generator capacity was released on behalf of 
the USG on May 1.  The bids are due in May 15, followed by a 
selection process and placement of the order by May 31.) 
 
¶7. (SBU) In meetings with Minister of Economy Shams, Mosbacher also 
discussed the need to be proactive in enabling prospective 
independent power producer (IPP) projects and identifying the 
customers they would service.  He urged Shams to work with urgency 
to establish a legal and regulatory framework that attracts IPPs. 
He emphasized the need to develop this market in such a way that the 
public utility -- especially as it is corporatized and then 
privatized -- not be left with a base of low-return customers. 
Embassy staff briefed Mosbacher on the work they have done to 
support this initiative.  They also highlighted a critical funding 
need for the services of legal experts, one familiar with 
Afghanistan and its power sector and the other with international 
experience, to help develop this framework.  Mosbacher raised this 
issue with Minister Shams.  Mosbacher encouraged the GoA not to be 
over-cautious about oil exploration for fear of losing to sharp 
investors.  It would be better to take a risk and deliver a small 
win soon than leave the resource undeveloped. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Mining, Aynak Copper, Access to Credit, Other Issues 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Mosbacher raised the Aynak copper mining tender process 
with Shams and with Minister of Commerce and Industry Farhang, 
urging that the GoA ensure transparency and consider the longer term 
prospects for the partner relationship, rather than just the initial 
offer terms.  He underscored that the American bidder, Phelps Dodge, 
has a long record of successful mining development and world-leading 
technology--both important considerations over the longer term. 
Shams and Farhang, both of whom are on the tender selection 
commission, said that they understand the importance of looking 
beyond the initial terms of the bid. 
 
¶9. (U) In several meetings with USG and GoA agencies, Mosbacher said 
that coordination between the private sector, development agencies, 
and governments would be needed to follow up on investment interest 
from DoleQs David Murdock not only in agriculture but also in 
carpet, marble, and possibly cashmere production and export.  A 
meeting with the USAID-funded Afghan WomenQs Business Federation 
provided a useful discussion of recent efforts at creating an 
Afghanistan carpet brand and ways in which these efforts could mesh 
with potential U.S. private investment.  Mosbacher and Mission staff 
also discussed an ARG-led truck leasing initiative which, when 
developed, would provide leasing capital for financing of truck 
fleets to selected, qualified operators in Afghanistan.  Mosbacher 
briefed USG, GoA, and Afghan and U.S. private players on upcoming 
OPIC projects to provide access to credit for small and medium-sized 
enterprises, as well as a potential U.S. industry source for 
low-cost solar power for civic buildings in remote areas.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶10. (U) MosbacherQs visit, his second to Afghanistan this year, 
amplified the theme of his January trip: that the U.S. is committed 
to helping Afghanistan by helping its private sector grow. The 
Marriott hotel deal, in itself an important investment, should 
cement that message as a major American brand becomes a landmark for 
visitors to Kabul.  Similarly, the competitive procurement of 
gensets to provide an additional 100 MW of power for Kabul will 
produce a visible difference in AfghanistanQs capital, with positive 
implications for political stability.  OPICQs proactive engagement 
on these and a number of small and medium-size projects here is 
making a difference, and we look forward to continued follow-up work 
together.  End comment.
