HUNTSMAN 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Shanghai Mayor HAN Zheng welcomed the 
upcoming visit by President Obama to Shanghai during an October 
14 call by Ambassador Huntsman.  The Ambassador outlined the 
Obama Administration's goal of a "positive, collaborative, and 
comprehensive" relationship with China and stressed the 
importance of the upcoming Shanghai Expo in strengthening mutual 
understanding between the United States and China.  Han seconded 
the Ambassador's observations and expressed hope the President 
would visit the site of the USA Pavilion at the Expo grounds 
during his November visit.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During a brief courtesy call October 14, Shanghai 
Mayor HAN Zheng reminisced about his meeting with then-Governor 
Huntsman three years earlier.  The Ambassador noted that he had 
been very impressed both by Shanghai and by Mayor Han himself. 
He added that the President is looking forward to his visit to 
China.  According to the Ambassador, President Obama has a very 
realistic view of U.S.-China relations and seeks a positive, 
collaborative, and comprehensive relationship with China. 
Currently, the Ambassador observed, U.S.-China relations are in 
a very positive period of growth and development, and the 
President will be able to see China's dynamism when he visits in 
November.  Han replied Shanghai is also looking forward to the 
President's visit.  He stressed the numerous connections between 
the United States and China and Shanghai in particular. 
Notably, the United States accounts for a quarter of China's 
global trade, and Shanghai is home to the largest number of 
U.S.-invested firms in China. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Reviewing his participation earlier in the day in a 
"topping off" ceremony for the USA Pavilion at the Shanghai Expo 
site, the Ambassador praised Han for the preparations for next 
year's World Exposition.  He stressed the potential for the Expo 
to enhance understanding between the United States and China. 
Han indicated the Shanghai Municipal Government, as the host of 
the Expo, had closely followed the progress of the various 
participants, including the United States.  The Ambassador's 
participation in the topping off ceremony demonstrated his 
support of Expo.  Han hoped the USA Pavilion will help to give 
Chinese a better understanding of American society and culture 
and extended an invitation for the President to visit the site 
of the Pavilion during his visit to Shanghai. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Completing the USA Pavilion is a priority for the 
United States, the Ambassador indicated.  He noted Secretary of 
State Clinton had raised the Shanghai Expo as the first point in 
his meeting with her, and he predicted the USA Pavilion will 
attract a large number of visitors.  The Ambassador commented 
that Han's management of the Expo preparations surely could win 
him awards from MBA schools and asked about plans for the future 
use of the site.  In addition, the Ambassador noted the 
increasingly global nature of U.S.-China relations that reaches 
beyond the traditional range of bilateral issues.  Shanghai, he 
observed, is a global city that exemplifies the complexity of 
China's relations with the United States and the rest of the 
world. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Han thanked the Ambassador for his support of the Expo 
as well as the support of the U.S. Government and Secretary 
Clinton.  He indicated the Shanghai authorities will follow the 
guidance and principles of the Bureau of International 
Expositions in the arrangements for conversion of the Expo site. 
 The Municipal Government expects to have its final plan for the 
site in place before the end of the Expo and will be soliciting 
input from international experts in this effort.  Much of the 
land will be converted into parks, museums, and international 
meeting facilities, Han said.
