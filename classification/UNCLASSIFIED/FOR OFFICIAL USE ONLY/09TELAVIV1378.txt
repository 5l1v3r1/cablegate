¶1. (SBU) Per ref A, Post raised the provision of voltage 
control oscillators through foreign consignee Elisra 
Electronic Systems to the Israel Defense Force.  According to 
Kobi Fogler from the Directorate of Security Defense 
Establishment (MALMAB), four oscillators were lost during 
tests, while the remaining oscillators were provided by 
Elisra to the IDF as part of the Multiple Launch Rocket 
System (MLRS) -- as stated on the export license.  Fogler 
promised a forthcoming official letter explaining further the 
four lost oscillators (ref B); Post will forward the letter 
separately once received.  Fogler discussed this case with 
polmiloff on June 22. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Fogler apologized for the delayed response 
confirming the intended use of the oscillators.  He noted 
that MLRS prime Elisra is teamed with sub-contractor Israel 
Military Industries (IMI); Elisra installs the oscillators as 
part of the trajectory correction system, which is then added 
to the IMI-built rocket body.  Fogler said it was necessary 
to check with both Elisra and IMI, in addition to confirming 
the end product with the IDF.  He also acknowledged staffing 
gaps within his own office as a further factor in the delayed 
confirmation.
