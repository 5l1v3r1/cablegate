SUBJECT: EMBLEM: AMBULANCE AND STATUTES UPDATE 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) MFA Director of International Organizations Daniel 
Meron told poloff May 9 that the GOI has not yet adopted a 
position on the stationing of five additional ambulances of 
the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in East 
Jerusalem.  He twice replied to direct questions about the 
GOI view on this issue with the statement, "I don't have news 
on that yet."  When asked about progress on implementing 
changes to Magen David Adom (MDA) statutes necessary for MDA 
to join the Red Cross / Red Crescent movement, Meron replied, 
"I was hoping you wouldn't ask.  There is no conclusion yet 
on the matter." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Meron also reported that the verification exercise 
conducted May 4 by Swiss Ambassador Didier Pfirter and the 
ICRC proved successful.  Pfirter and the ICRC witnessed a 
PRCS ambulance test the "fast lanes" established by the GOI 
to accelerate passage of PRCS ambulances through Israeli 
checkpoints.  Meron said that Pfirter told him that the PRCS 
ambulance used as a test case had moved rapidly through a 
checkpoint from Ramallah into East Jerusalem.  (Note: Meron 
also reported that Israeli police stopped the PRCS ambulance 
while it was driving in East Jerusalem, to ask the drivers 
what they were doing there.  Meron said that MDA ambulance 
drivers on the scene explained the new GOI policy to the 
police officers.  End note.)
