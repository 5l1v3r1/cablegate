SUBJECT: ABYEI UPDATE: UNMIS OBSERVERS ACTIVITIES RESTRICTED BEFORE 
MANDATE ENDS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The 14-day period during which UNMIS peacekeepers were 
permitted to patrol outside of the town of Abyei ended on April 21, 
without being renewed by Sudan's Joint Military Commission (JMC). 
The JMC did grant UNMIS specific authority to travel from Abyei town 
to Higlig in order to meet and escort convoys of returning IDPs 
during the next eight weeks. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Even during the 14 days period, UNMIS observers' ability 
to operate north of the town was severely restricted by the SAF, 
according to UN officials in Abyei.  (One described it as 
"negotiated access.")  According to one UNMIS official, UN 
peacekeepers were required to obtain clearance for patrols 24 hours 
in advance and were restricted to travel along an agreed, 
predetermined route.  On patrol, observers were not able to 
investigate immediately new reports of incidents.  This severely 
limited their ability to respond to reports in a flexible and timely 
way. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In response to the SAF's restrictions on UNMIS, the SPLA 
responded by also restricting UNMIS' freedom to patrol to the south 
of the town.  SPLA officials told Juba Consul General Datta on April 
21 that they were unwilling to provide access to their activities 
without reciprocal access from the SAF.  They further noted that the 
current situation in Abyei is "normal", and stated that the SPLA is 
not engaging in any unusual level of activity. Senior Misseriyya 
Arab leaders told CDA Fernandez on April 21 in Khartoum that the 
Charge's visit to Muglad had "bought some time" by calming 
Misseriyya fears of being marginalized but that those "good 
feelings" would not last forever. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  The announcement two weeks ago that UNMIS 
observers would be able to patrol outside of Abyei town offered hope 
that they would be able to reduce local tensions by providing some 
transparency to the security situation there.  There does seem to 
have been an improvement in the overall atmosphere in Abyei, for a 
variety of reasons. The failure to extend this mandate, plus the 
restrictions imposed on UNMIS before it ended, means that 
uncertainty and the resulting potential for conflict, either 
intended or unintended, will continue. It is important for the 
United States to keep highlighting the issue of Abyei and to 
continue to counsel patience and progress on the ground to both the 
Misseriyya and Ngok Dinka.
