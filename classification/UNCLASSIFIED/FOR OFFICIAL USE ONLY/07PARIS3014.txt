SUBJECT: OECD: PARTNERSHIP FOR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE PDG)- COUNCIL 
APPROVES ESTABLISHING PDG ADVISORY UNIT 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The OECD Council on July 12 agreed to the establishment at 
the OECD of an Advisory Unit (AU) for the proposed Partnership for 
Democratic Governance (PDG)  The decision was taken as an "A" point 
- consensus having been reached prior to the Council meeting, with 
no discussion by Permanent Representatives.  This consensus was 
obtained as a result of an extensive review on July 3 by the 
Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and on July 10 by the 
Executive Committee (ExCom) and follow-up discussions with the two 
countries, the Netherlands and Austria, that had maintained reserves 
following the ExCom deliberations. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Next steps will be implementation of the decision, 
including recruitment for positions in the newly established AU, 
further refining of the terms of reference for the AU, and ensuring 
full financial support from other contributors (currently Australia 
and the U.S. have made formal pledges totaling 4.6 million USD, and 
we understand that Canada will soon announce a substantial 
contribution).  The Secretariat hopes to complete the job 
descriptions and begin advertising for the AU positions by the end 
of July in order to ensure that the process of establishing the unit 
moves forward quickly in the fall when the PDG itself is rolled out. 
 Another key element is the need to develop a public affairs element 
as part of the PDG rollout strategy.  The Secretariat has appealed 
to us to coordinate the rollout to maximize the impact and clarity 
of our statements. 
 
¶3.  (U) USOECD wishes to express its appreciation for the excellent 
support provided by OECD posts in ensuring today's positive 
decision.  Special thanks to Embassies Brussels, The Hague and 
Vienna whose efforts enabled us to avoid a potentially dilatory 
discussion in Council.  We look forward to working with OECD posts 
as the decision is implemented in the fall and the PDG gets up and 
running.
