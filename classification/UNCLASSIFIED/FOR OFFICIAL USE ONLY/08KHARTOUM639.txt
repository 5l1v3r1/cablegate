SUBJECT: SUDAN HEALTH MINISTRY REQUESTS SANCTIONS WAIVER ON CANCER 
TREATMENT EQUIPMENT 
 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request.  See para 5. 
 
¶2.  (U) SUMMARY:  Post has been contacted by the Sudanese Ministry 
of Health (via Sudanese Foreign Ministry), in a note dated 
4/13/2008, with a request for assistance in permitting importation 
of radioisotopes and related equipment for cancer therapy.  The 
Director General of the Radiation and Isotopes Center of Khartoum 
informed the Ministry that the Varian Brachytherapy Services Company 
refuses to ship these items to Sudan due to U.S. export controls and 
economic sanctions.  Post requests Department's guidance and 
assistance in seeking the necessary waiver(s) on humanitarian 
grounds to allow export of these items to Sudan.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (U) The note from the Health Ministry requests Embassy's 
assistance with facilitating the importation, and in granting the 
U.S.-based company the necessary license to operate in Sudan, in 
order that cancer patients in Sudan not be deprived of this 
life-saving medical treatment.  An attached letter to the Minister 
of Health from Dr. Hussein Mohamed Ahmed, Director of the Radiation 
and Isotopes Center in Khartoum, explains that the equipment in 
question is a "Brachytherapy High Dose Rate Machine."  He states 
that "this machine treats cancer patients suffering from cervix 
cancer, pharynx cancer, breast cancer, nasal pharynx, rectal cancer, 
bladder cancer and prostate cancer.  The lack of this machine means 
depriving all these patients from treatment, thus, loss of hope in 
recovery and ending their suffering." 
 
¶4.  (U) Accompanying the request is a copy of a March 13, 2008 email 
from Richard Dillon, identified as "Varian Brachytherapy Service 
Manager" (tel. +44-1293-601-295; email Richard.Dillon@varian.com) 
informing that "Varian is a US based company, and further to recent 
advice from our US Corporate department we have been instructed to 
check compliance against the current export control policy - which 
at the current time prohibits Varian personnel from carrying out any 
business activities in Sudan.  Unfortunately this means that we are 
temporarily unable to ship the radioactive source wires to Sudan, as 
doing so would contravene these policies.  Of course we are 
constantly monitoring the situation, and will of course re-commence 
the supply immediately we're given the go-ahead to do so." 
 
¶5.  (U) ACTION REQUESTED: Post supports an export license in this 
case if at all possible for obvious humanitarian and medical 
reasons.  It is our understanding that the U.S. exporter (Varian) 
must apply to the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign 
Assets Control (OFAC) for a license to export to Sudan.  We request 
that the Department contact OFAC to ascertain whether Varian has 
done so.  If application has been made, we request that the 
Department work with OFAC to facilitate its issuance.  If Varian has 
not applied, we request prompt guidance on how to respond to the 
Health Ministry so as to assist them in facilitating this export.
