¶1. (U) South Africa will not send troops to Somalia, 
announced Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota January 25.  In 
press comments following a meeting with President Mbeki, 
Lekota expressed support for the proposed AU peacekeeping 
mission in Somalia, but stressed that South African forces 
are already stretched thin with deployments in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire, and 
Ethiopia/Eritrea.  Sending troops to Somalia could jeopordize 
the effectiveness of these other missions. 
 
¶2. (U) Lekota's spokesman Sam Mkhwanazi said the Department 
of Defense is currently looking at other options by which the 
South African military might be able to support the Somali AU 
mission. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Institute for Security Studies analyst Henri Boshoff 
told PolOff January 25 that he believes South Africa may 
offer military personnel for the mission headquarters staff. 
They are also looking at assisting with the training of 
Somali forces and police.  On the non-military side, the 
Department of Foreign Affairs is considering support for 
capacity-building for the Transitional Federal Government. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Boshoff noted that this is the first time that 
senior South African political leaders -- Lekota, President 
Mbeki, ForMin Dlamini-Zuma, and DepForMin Pahad -- have 
publicly admitted that the South African military has 
capacity constraints.  In previous crises, Mbeki promised to 
deploy troops even if the military told him they were not 
available, like in Darfur where South Africa has provided 
only 400 of the 750 troops promised for AMIS. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: While the SAG will not deploy ground troops 
to Somalia, South Africa is looking for other ways to support 
the AU mission.  As noted in Ref A, we recommend funneling 
any concrete suggestions for South African involvement 
through the African Union or other regional leaders.
