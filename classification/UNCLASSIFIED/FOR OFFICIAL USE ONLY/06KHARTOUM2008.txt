¶1. (U) Summary: The process of preparing for WTO accession is 
helping to drive economic reform in Sudan.  Although Sudan's WTO 
membership is stalled, economic reforms and trade liberalization 
continue, helping to encourage a more pragmatic approach to economic 
questions. End Summary.

WTO Accession Leads to Pragmatic Approach to Economy 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On August 17, Pol/Econ Officer met with Badr Eddin 
Suileman, Sudan's Chief National Negotiator for WTO accession. 
Suileman provided an overview of the changes in the Sudanese economy 
as efforts are made to bring Sudan into the WTO. He believes that 
there has been a gradual weakening of ideological positions and a 
growth of a more pragmatic approach to the economy and attributes 
this in part to the internal process surrounding WTO accession.

Banking and Telecommunications Sectors Opening 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Sulieman underlined that certain sectors, notably banking 
and telecommunications had seen substantial change, with private 
market openings and increased global ties. In banking, Sulieman 
said, the reform process has culminated in the licensing of four new 
foreign banks with share capital exceeding all previously existing 
banks. The new banks bring an international outlook that changes the 
business environment in Sudan. In the telecommunications area, 
Sulieman said that Sudan has seen unprecedented reform. The sector 
has moved from an absolute government monopoly a decade ago to being 
almost fully privatized. Three of the four companies in the sector 
are private, and the fourth, Sudatel, is a joint venture with a 
government majority shareholding.  Total investment in the sector 
exceeds USD 2.6 billion. Telecommunications companies play a leading 
role in the Sudan Stock Market.

WTO Bilaterals Pinnpoint Areas for Econ Policy Reform 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) While Sudan continues to grapple with the problems of 
implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and the Darfur 
Peace Agreement (DFA), internal work has quietly continued on WTO 
accession. Bilateral consultations were last held in 2005, and the 
accession process effectively is on hold. However, Sulieman noted 
that there have been significant changes in Sudan's economy in 
recent years. He noted that in the bilaterals, 580 questions had 
been submitted to Sudan, most of them from the United States. 
Sulieman said these questions had been very helpful, and had 
assisted in the formulation of economic reforms.

CPA, DPA Cited as Reform Agents; SPLM Supports 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶5. (SBU) Sulieman related how he had made a presentation to the 
Council of Ministers on August 6, detailing Sudan's track record on 
WTO accession in 2005 and early 2006.  He received permission to 
conduct the presentation in English (the Council of Ministers 
normally conducts business in Arabic).  Sulieman said that the SPLM 
members of the council applauded when he stated that the recent 
peace accords, (CPA and DPA), "would inspire a redefinition of Sudan 
and a reinvention of a new Republic; united in diversity and 
decentralized governance" and "...the prospects for Sudan 
integrating into the world economy have never looked better."
