DURABLE SOLUTIONS FOR REMAINING REFUGEES FROM KOSOVO CRISIS 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Summary:   Ten years after the influx of nearly 
350,000 refugees to Macedonia during the Kosovo crisis, the 
Government of Macedonia, together with UNHCR Skopje, is 
working to create durable solutions for the remaining 
approximately 1,600 refugees and asylum seekers, nearly all 
of whom are ethnic Roma. The GoM opened an integration center 
for refugees in October and passed a national action plan for 
the integration of refugees in early November, providing 
nearly one million Euros in funding for the program for 2010. 
 While plans and programs for integration  continue to 
develop, increasing numbers of the remaining refugees are 
seeking to return to Kosovo.  Kosovo's independence and 
refugees' expectations of increased international funding are 
presumed to be behind the increase in requests for returns. 
Through the combination of integration and returns, UNHCR 
Skopje has set out a solutions/exit strategy that aims to 
find durable solutions for the vast majority of remaining 
refugees by 2011.  While solutions for the remaining Kosovo 
refugees move forward, the quality of Macedonia's legal 
framework for refugee and asylum determinations has also 
improved-- providing a more stable foundation for addressing 
refugee issues in the future. The Parliament passed a new law 
on asylum and temporary protection (which entered into force 
on December 15).  This law meets all EU standards for asylum 
and temporary protection and most international standards 
promoted by UNHCR. End Summary. 
 
Integration Plan:  A Regional Model? 
----------------------------------- 

¶2.  (SBU) In early November, the GoM adopted a national 
action plan for integration of refugees and foreigners.  The 
action plan follows passage in December 2008 of a strategic 
plan for integration of refugees.  UNHCR strongly supported 
the process, aiding in finding a professional consultant to 
develop the plan, and providing input and modifications as 
the plan developed.  At the time the Strategic Plan was 
adopted, UNHCR Skopje indicated that Macedonia was the first, 
and perhaps would be the only, country in the region to adopt 
a comprehensive approach to integration of Kosovo refugees. 
According to UNHCR Skopje, some other neighboring countries 
indicated they would base future diplomatic relations with 
Kosovo on return of refugees. (Macedonia recognized Kosovo's 
independence in October 2008 and established full diplomatic 
relations earlier this year.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Somewhat surprisingly, there has not been public or 
political opposition to the plan, even at the often 
contentious budgeting stage.  The GoM budgeted nearly 1 
million Euros for the integration plan for 2010.  With 
assistance and support of UNHCR, the Ministry of Labor and 
Social Policy (MLSP) opened an Integration Center in the 
majority-Roma Skopje municipality of Shuto Orizari in 
October.  While the strategic and action plans for 
integration call for long-term assistance to refugees in the 
areas of housing and employment, the 1 million Euro budget 
will initially only allow for the MLSP to take over direct 
support payments for accommodations to refugees from UNHCR, 
beginning January 1. The GoM hopes to draw financial support 
from the international community to further develop services 
of the integration center, aiming toward eventual 
naturalization of those refugees who seek to remain. 
 
Applications for Returns Way Up 
------------------------------- 

¶4.  (SBU) While plans move forward to provide integration 
assistance to some refugees, others are seeking voluntary 
return to Kosovo.  In recent years, fewer than 50 refugees 
per year applied for return to Kosovo.  Following Kosovo 
independence, there was a sharp increase in applications for 
return, with more than 300 refugees applying this year.  With 
increased applications, UNHCR Skopje is concerned about the 
slow speed of returns to Kosovo (reporting that only 31 
refugees have returned this year) and reports an urgent need 
for streamlining of the return/reintegration procedures in 
Kosovo. 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The plan forward for integration of 
remaining refugees from the Kosovo crisis has, surprisingly, 
not/not been politicized here.  UNHCR gives high marks to the 
plan, viewing it as a positive development in the region. 
While Kosovo recognition, border demarcation, and 
establishment of diplomatic relations with Kosovo all met 
with expected political posturing and considerable media 
coverage, the refugee integration plan has passed quietly and 
without political opposition -- a bright spot in inter-ethnic 
relations in the Balkans.  End Comment.
