(SBU) Post delivered points (ref a) to Ziad Karablieh, 
Director General of International Economic Relations in the 
Palestinian Authority (PA) Ministry of National Economy, on 
April 18.  Karablieh confirmed that the PA would not be 
sending a representative to the Arab League boycott meeting 
in Damascus on April 21-24.  Karablieh said that the PA has a 
"stable policy" of engaging with Israeli businesses and is, 
in fact, seeking significant Israeli participation in the 
upcoming Bethlehem Investment Conference.  EconChief noted 
that a local Palestinian representative in Damascus 
apparently attended the November 2007 meeting after post 
received similar assurances (ref b).  Karablieh said that he 
would pass our concerns to the Minister of National Economy.
