SUBJECT: GOMA NOTES 06/13/08: NAIROBI PROCESS - 26TH MEETING OF THE 
JMG TASK FORCE, JUNE 13, 2008, BUKAVU 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: The 26th meeting of the Joint Monitoring Group 
Task Force, held in Bukavu June 13, featured a briefing on FARDC 
operations against the FDLR by General Patrick Masunzu of the 10th 
Military Region.  Masunzu reported that four newly-deployed 
integrated and MONUC-trained battalions are focusing on cutting FDLR 
supply routes.  He stressed that he has instructed his commanders to 
maintain local communities' confidence.  The Rwandan delegation 
expressed appreciation for the level of detail in Masunzu's 
briefing, but raised concerns about FDLR incursions into Rwanda and 
FARDC-FDLR collaboration.  MONUC's DDRRR and political affairs 
sections briefed the group on their public awareness campaigns and 
related issues.  MONUC DDRRR has told FDLR commanders that the only 
way to hold an "inter-Rwandan dialogue" is for the FDLR to return to 
Rwanda and register as a legitimate political party.  End summary. 
 
FARDC briefing 
--------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Members of the Nairobi process Joint Monitoring Group Task 
Force (JMG-TF) traveled June 13 to Bukavu for their 26th session. 
The meeting began with a briefing on FARDC operations against the 
FDLR by acting 10th Military Region commander General Patrick 
Masunzu.  The Congolese military has deployed four integrated and 
MONUC-trained battalions to South Kivu to cut FDLR supply routes. 
Masunzu described in detail the location of FDLR forces and the 
weapons available to them. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Masunzu stressed that he has instructed his commanders to 
avoid any activity that could cause local populations to lose 
confidence in the FARDC.  He said the military has also engaged 
traditional and religious authorities and other elements of civil 
society to deliver the message that the FDLR must return to Rwanda 
and that only the FARDC is responsible for providing security.  He 
claimed that most FDLR fighters want to go back to Rwanda, but are 
effectively held hostage by their commanders.  He appeared to 
believe that their return would depend on the Rwandan government 
agreeing to a political ("inter-Rwandan") dialogue with the FDLR. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Major Franco Rutagengwa, head of the Rwandan delegation, 
expressed appreciation for Masunzu's briefing.  He said it contained 
a level of detail that had not previously been provided by the GDRC. 
 He then raised the issue of FDLR incursions into Rwanda and alleged 
that certain FARDC brigades are cooperating with the FDLR. 
Rutagengwa implied that the GDRC is not doing enough to secure the 
border or mining sites being exploited by the FDLR.  He also asked 
when the FARDC will begin forced disarmament of the FDLR. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Masunzu said he was not aware of FDLR incursions into 
Rwanda or collaboration with the FARDC.  He requested more specific 
information in order to investigate.  He stated that measures are in 
place to protect the border, but, citing operational security, did 
not provide specific details.  Colonel Augustin Mamba, DRC head of 
delegation, said that the FARDC is in a phased process of action 
against the FDLR, and proceeding from one phase to another takes a 
certain amount of time. 
 
MONUC DDRRR briefing 
-------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) MONUC DDRRR and political affairs sections then briefed 
the group on public awareness activities and other related issues to 
follow up the Nairobi communique. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The DDRRR officer said that MONUC began a robust public 
awareness campaign in South Kivu in April.  This includes active 
seeking of assistance from political and traditional authorities. 
He said they are now working in collaboration with the GDRC, an 
element which he characterized as relatively new. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) MONUC DDRRR is planning a series of events at local 
markets which FDLR members are known to frequent.  The principal 
focus will be countering the message that those who go back to 
Rwanda are persecuted.  DDRRR representatives have met with FDLR 
commanders in an effort to influence them along the same lines. 
They have stressed that the only way to hold an "inter-Rwandan 
dialogue" is for the FDLR to return to Rwanda and transform itself 
into a legitimate political party. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Responding to a question from Mamba, the DDRRR officer 
said that 255 FDLR members have returned to Rwanda since January, of 
which 105 were combatants.  The Rwandan delegation disputed this 
figure, leading to agreement to examine the issue further at the 
next JMG-TF meeting. 
 
MONUC political briefing 
 
KINSHASA 00000555  002 OF 002 
 
 
------------------------ 
 
¶10.  (SBU) A MONUC political affairs officer provided a general 
overview of current FDLR activities in South Kivu, including 
recruitment and stepped-up efforts to dominate strategic areas.  He 
noted that the FDLR began reorganizing its forces following the 
Nairobi communique more along guerilla lines, with groups of 20-30 
fighters patrolling and controlling territories.  In some areas, 
FDLR members are integrated with the community, in others they live 
in military camps.  Civilians in areas under FDLR control appear 
apprehensive about possible operations against the group.  They fear 
reprisals or being accidentally targeted. 
 
¶11. (SBU) The officer recommended that:  the GDRC increase its 
public information activities in South Kivu; the international 
community pressure FDLR leaders in Europe; Rwanda make clear to the 
FDLR that conditions there are conducive to repatriation; and the 
threat of military action against the FDLR be intensified. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶12. (SBU) Rutagengwa's effort to express appreciation for Masunzu's 
briefing was noteworthy.  The meeting was otherwise relatively 
straightforward, with few theatrics or hyperbole by either the 
Congolese or Rwandan delegations.  End comment
