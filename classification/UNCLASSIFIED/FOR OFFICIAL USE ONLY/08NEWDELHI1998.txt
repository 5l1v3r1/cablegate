¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered the information contained in ref A 
on July 21 to Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) directors 
for Disarmament and International Security Affairs (DISA) 
Gaddam Dharmendra and Amandeep Singh Gill.  Dharmendra 
replied that India looks forward to fully participating in 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GI) 
activities.  He said the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) 
would likely send staff to the conference on legal and 
regulatory frameworks at the Marshall Center on September 4-5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following up on ref B, Dharmendra said that DISA 
would likely be the Indian government's bureaucratic point of 
contact for GI activities, but that they plan to provide 
several points of contact on various issues, including in 
DAE.  He said he would share the contact information for 
specific individuals soon.  He reiterated India's interest in 
proposing and hosting a GI activity in the near future, but 
he said the nature of such an activity has not yet been 
discussed.
