between opposition parties and the Government of the Kingdom

reftel points and said that the SADC heads of state or their

President Kikwete, most likely at the State House, beginning 
the early evening of March 28.  The summit meeting itself

day with a communiqu or press statement.

Minster of Foreign Affairs Bernard Membe, all 14 member SADC 
member states are planning to send a representative to the 
Extraordinary Summit of SADC Heads of State.  Katuki said the 
Government of Tanzania has been notified that the Government 
of Zimbabwe is sending a delegation, but could not confirm if 
President Robert Mugabe would be heading up the GOZ 
delegation. 
 
¶3.  (U) Local press reports have noted the following heads of 
state would arrive in Dar es Salaam before 5 p.m. on

President Guebuza of Mozambique, and Prime Minister Mosisili 
of Lesotho. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  Post will closely monitor the March 29

assistant, told PolCouns that as soon as possible after the 
conclusion of the summit, MFA would brief the same heads of 
mission (i.e. United States, Canada and select EU envoys) 
whom Minister Membe met with to discuss President Kikwete's 
March 15 meeting with Mugabe (Ref C).
