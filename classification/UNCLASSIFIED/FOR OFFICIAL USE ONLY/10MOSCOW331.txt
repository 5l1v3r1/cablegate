THIS CABLE CONTAINS AN ACTION REQUEST FOR THE QUITO COUNTRY OFFICE, 
THE BOGOTA COUNTRY OFFICE, THE LIMA COUNTRY OFFICE, THE WARSAW 
COUNTRY OFFICE, AND THE GUAYAQUIL RESIDENT OFFICE. 
 
1.(SBU) On February 11, 2010, the Moscow CO took part in a case 
coordination meeting among multiple Russian law enforcement 
entities. Participants included; Sergey Muraviev, Cocaine Unit 
Chief, Federal Security Service, ("FSB"), Dmitry Abakumov, Cocaine 
Unit Chief, Ministry of Interior ("MVD"), Nikolay Kukharenko, 
Cocaine Unit Chief, Russian Federal Drug Control Agency ("FSKN"), 
Andrey Metsger, Division Head, MVD Investigative Committee, Denis 
Popov, Investigator, MVD Investigative Committee and Vitaly Fedotov, 
International Cooperation Department, FSB. 
 
2.(SBU) Background of Operation Baltic Strike: 
 
Since 2005, the Moscow Country Office has been conducting Operation 
Baltic Strike which targets the maritime movements of cocaine from 
South America to Russia.  This is a very successful joint operation 
that has resulted in the seizure of approximately 676 kilograms of 
cocaine, 26 arrests, and approximately $200,000 USD.  In 2009, the 
FSKN joined the operation.  As a result of Operation Baltic Strike, 
the Moscow CO and Russian counterparts identified the Vladimir 
KRASAVCHIKOV DTO as one of the most significant cocaine DTOs 
operating in Russia. 
 
3.(SBU) As reported in Reference (A), on January 14, 2010, the 
Moscow CO learned that Andrey SHINDER was expected to pick up a 
shipment of cocaine while in Guayaquil, Ecuador.    SHINDER is a 
steward onboard the shipping vessel M/V Pietari Cloud and has been 
identified as a member of the KRASAVCHIKOV DTO. 
 
4.(SBU)  As reported in Reference (B), on January 20, 2010, the M/V 
PIETARI CLOUD arrived in the Puerto Maritimo, Guayaquil, Ecuador. 
 
¶5. (SBU) As reported in Reference (C), on January 22, Guayaquil RO 
reported, SHINDER departed the ship and passed through port security 
in Guyaquil, Ecuador, with a group of crewmembers.  At the time, 
SHINDER was wearing a black polo type collard shirt, blue jeans, 
with dark collar length hair.  Later in the day, SHINDER returned to 
the port, and was observed passing through port security, carrying a 
black, weighted bag on his shoulder. 
 
Agents Note: Surveillance video was obtained by the Guyaquil RO as 
SHINDER passed through the ports entry/exit point.  A copy of this 
video was passed to the Moscow CO and was subsequently shared with 
Russian law enforcement. 
 
6.(SBU) On January 23, 2010, Guyaquil RO reported, Customs/Port K-9 
unit conducted a routine search of the ship, with negative results. 
The Port Unit did not know about the on-going investigation, as the 
Guyaquil RO and vetted Unit Commander deemed it necessary to 
 
MOSCOW 00000331  002 OF 004 
 
 
maintain the integrity of this investigation.  The customs search 
did not uncover SHINDER's bag as they searched crewmembers cabins, 
nor was the bag located anywhere else on the vessel. 
 
7.(SBU) On January 23, 2010, the M/V Pietari Cloud departed Guyaquil 
with its' final destination believed to be St. Petersburg, Russia. 
 
8.(SBU) On Monday, February 8, 2010, the Moscow CO was informed by 
the Russian Security Service (FSB) that the M/V Pietari Cloud, prior 
to arriving in St. Petersburg, Russia,  would travel to Gdansk, 
Poland on February 19, 2010. 
 
Agent's Note: It is believed that Gdansk, Poland may be a refueling 
point for the M/V Pietari Cloud. 
 
9.(SBU) ACTION REQUEST FOR THE WARSAW CO: 
 
The Moscow CO requests the assistance of the Warsaw CO and Polish 
counterparts to assist in the surveillance of the PIETARI CLOUD 
while docked in Gdansk, Poland and conduct surveillance in the 
scenario if SHINDER attempts to off load the cocaine shipment in 
Gdansk.  The Moscow CO believes surveillance of the M/V PIETARI 
CLOUD, will aid in the subsequent Russian prosecution of members of 
the KRASAVCHIKOV DTO. 
 
10.(SBU) Russian Customs (FTS) and the interagency working group 
including FSB, MVD and FSKN will prepare to conduct a thorough 
inspection of the commercial shipping vessel, M/V PIETARI CLOUD, 
upon its return to St. Petersburg, Russia. 
 
11.(SBU) In addition, the Joint DEA Russian Interagency Task Force 
will prepare for the arrest of the following individuals identified 
as members of the KRASAVCHIKOV DTO and linked to this 
investigation:

Rishat STRELTSOV - NADDIS Negative

Priority Target Vladimir KRASAVCHIKOV - NADDIS # 6305832.

KRASAVCHIKOV may be residing with Lidia ESPINOZA-Quniteros in Quito, 
Ecuador.  ESPINOZA-Quinteros is identified as a source of supply and 
broker for the KRASAVCHIKOV DTO. 
 
13.(SBU)  On January 26, 2010, the Moscow CO received immigration 
records from the Guyaquil RO regarding country entry/exit records 
for KRASAVCHIKOV and his aliases.  According to immigration records,

KRASAVCHIKOV DTO has criminal contacts in Peru and Colombia and it 
may be possible that KRASAVCHIKOV may be residing in Peru or 
Colombia.  KRASAVCHIKOV and his aliases are listed below:
