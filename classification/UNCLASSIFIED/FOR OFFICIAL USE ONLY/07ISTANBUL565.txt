SUBJECT: BSEC 15TH ANNIVERSARY SUMMIT: A PROTOCOL TRIUMPH 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The BSEC 15th anniversary summit held in 
Istanbul on June 25 proved that Turkey could deliver a high 
level protocol event, including participation by eleven of 
the twelve BSEC member heads of state or government. 
Armenia, the only hold out, was represented by Foreign 
Minister Oskanian.  The bulk of the formal interventions 
consisted of laudatory statements on BSEC's efforts to renew 
itself as an institution, heralded transport projects that 
aim to improve road and sea links in the greater Black Sea 
region, applauded the decision to grant observer status to 
the EU, and described the major political and economic 
changes the region has undergone since the organization was 
founded in 1992.  Political strife - in the form of the 
conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh as well as over the future 
status of Kosovo - was prominent in several Leaders' remarks. 
 However the delegations appeared to interact cordially with 
one another and a number of bilateral meetings, including 
between Turkish FM Gul and Armenian FM Oskanian, took place 
on the margins of the summit (septel).  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On June 25, Ambassador Wilson represented the USG as 
an observer at the 15th anniversary summit of the 
organization for Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC). 
Remarks by member states and observers highlighted BSEC's 
efforts to reform and restructure the institution to focus 
more on projects that would demonstrate the usefulness of 
BSEC.  Speakers highlighted two major transport projects - 
the Black Sea Ring Highway and the Motorways of the Sea - 
that will support economic integration in the region.  The 
BSEC Foreign Ministers approved the EU's application for 
observer status and the BSEC and EU troikas met on the 
margins of the summit to discuss next steps. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Ambassador's remarks to the Council of Foreign 
Ministers stressed the US role in BSEC as an interested 
observer in an organization that has a key regional role to 
play.  The Ambassador highlighted US efforts to support BSEC 
goals and institutions including:  USAID's Black Sea Regional 
Electricity Transmission Planning Project; a joint BSEC - USG 
environmental protection symposium planned for September 
2007; our $10 million contribution to the German Marshall 
Fund's Black Sea Trust; and exercises and training with 
partners in the region on emergency planning, port security 
and trade-friendly maritime standards. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Political conflicts were a subject of discussion 
first at the Council of Foreign Ministers and again at the 
Summit.  Albania and Serbia sparred over the final status of 
Kosovo. Albanian PM Berisha argued strongly for restoring 
Kosovo's status in favor of independence now, contended that 
due to its unique history Kosovo was a sui generis situation 
and Serbian President Tadic argued to the contrary, debunked 
the idea that Kosovo won't set a precedent and said that a 
change of borders in Serbia had the potential to ignite 
frozen conflicts and insurgencies that nearly all of the BSEC 
member states face or have faced in the recent past.  Armenia 
and Azerbaijan similarly argued over the situation in 
Nagorno-Karabakh.  Azeri President Aliyev argued that 
Armenian "military aggression and ethnic cleansing" in 
Nagorno-Karabakh must be resolved, but also pointed to 
compromise and negotiation as the best reason for doing so. 
Armenian FM Oskanian held firm noting that the Armenians of 
Nagorno-Karabakh had successfully defending themselves 
against attacks from the Azeri government.  One of the most 
interesting exchanges occurred when German Minister of State 
Erler out maneuvered European Commission Vice President 
Verheugen and took the podium to deliver remarks on the 
behalf of the EU.  Verheugen's staff convinced the Turkish 
hosts to give equal time to Verheugen, who delivered remarks 
strikingly similar to Erler's. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Russian President Putin was and acted like the 
Summit's star during his approximately six hours in Istanbul. 
 His Summit intervention was suitably bland.  Russia's real 
work took place elsewhere -- including in South Stream and 
other energy tactics before the Summit and during it with the 
Greeks.  Putin apparently held bilaterals with most or all of 
his counterparts except Georgian President Saakashvili whom, 
one Russian diplomat reported, Putin has seen recently enough 
that no new meeting was necessary.  FM Lavrov distinguished 
himself by talking on the phone and/or holding outside 
meetings throughout the BSEC foreign minister's meeting.  His 
interaction with Georgian FM Bezhuashvili was particularly 
frequent -- and cordial. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment.  The BSEC 15th anniversary summit was a 
protocol tour de force for Turkey.  Although very little of 
substance occurred at the summit meeting, simply getting 
these personalities into the same room at the same time was a 
significant accomplishment in and of itself.  BSEC has 
evolved as an institution since its inception 15 years ago. 
However, much work remains to be done if BSEC is to meet its

stated goal of becoming efficient and effective.  End 
Comment.
