SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #13 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The following report provides security-related 
information for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon 
February 23, 2010. Please visit the following link for additional 
classified reporting: 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency USG Joint Operations Center can be contacted 
on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 4013. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U//FOUO//LES) Canadian and USG authorities are currently 
unaware of any specific, credible threats to the Games. Though the 
frequency of organized demonstrations has diminished since February 
15, ad hoc protest activity at event and public locations remains a 
concern. Canadian security officials indicate anti-Olympics groups 
may stage limited demonstrations as the Games draw to a close. 
 
 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U//FOUO//LES)  Calls for Service Up, Crime Down - According to 
information provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), a 
recent snapshot of local criminal activity revealed there were 260 
calls for service between midnight and noon on February 22, ten of 
which occurred within the 150-metre buffer zone around Olympic 
venues.  Nothing of consequence to Olympic security was noted. 
Additionally, reports of Breaking and Entering were down 73% 
compared to the same period last year, and there were 74% fewer 
Theft from Auto incidents. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U)  Women's Gold Medal Hockey Game: US vs. Canada - On 
 
February 25 at 3:30 p.m. PST, the US and Canadian women's teams 
will face off for the gold medal at Canada Hockey Place.  While the 
women's tournament has not garnered the same level of media 
coverage as the men's, passions are expected to run high, 
especially given the recent 5-3 defeat of Team Canada by the US 
men's squad. 
 
 
 
Protests: 
 
 
 
¶5.  (U) February 22 Protest Activity - No Olympics-related protests 
occurred February 22. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (U) Current Protest Activity - There are no Olympics-related 
protests scheduled for today, February 23. 
 
¶7.  (U) Anticipated Protest Activity - On February 24, activists 
plan to stage a "Share the Gold" human chain protest in the 
Downtown East Side from 4:45 - 5:15pm PST.  Demonstrators hope to 
form a chain of individuals for three blocks along either side of 
East Hastings Street, between Carrall Street and Gore Avenue.  The 
protest will likely be peaceful, but may cause minor traffic 
disruptions. 
 
¶8.  (U//FOUO//LES) Local law enforcement sources and activist 
handbills indicate an anti-Olympics protest is scheduled from 3:30 
-6:30 p.m. PST, February 24 at Grandview Park.  RCMP advised a 
small number of activists who protest the use of the Britannia 
Community Services Centre rink for Olympics practice intend to 
convene at the park - some two blocks from the Britannia Community 
Centre - and following a brief demonstration, to march from the 
 
park to the rink.  The protest has been advertised via community 
handbills and posters, but has not to date drawn significant 
promise of support.  The US men's and women's hockey teams have 
scheduled practice on February 23 at the Britannia facility; it is 
unlikely their activities will be affected.  RCMP and Vancouver 
Police are monitoring the situation and have sufficient security 
measures in place. 
 
¶9.  (U) Bicyclists and skaters plan to participate in a "Critical 
Mass Bike Ride" departing from the Vancouver Art Gallery around 6 
p.m. on February 26. This recurring event is taking place as 
regularly scheduled and is not anti-Olympics in nature; however, 
the route is unknown and could affect the Men's Hockey Semi-Final 
game at 6:30 p.m. at Canada Hockey Place. Minor traffic disruptions 
are expected. 
 
 
 
¶10.  (U) A "Games Over! Resistance Lives!" demonstration is 
scheduled to occur from 1 to 3pm PST on February 28 at the 
intersection of Smithe and Cambie Streets. The event is advertised 
as a "noisy public festival to celebrate our communities and our 
resistance."  This demonstration is being touted on the militant 
activist website www.no2010.com. 
 
 
 
Incidents: 
 
 
 
¶11.  (U)  No Olympics-related security incidents occurred during 
this reporting period. 
 
Threats: 
 
 
 
¶12.  (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
transnational terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
 
 
¶13.  (SBU) Other than scheduled USOC and team movements, no major 
Olympics-related security operations have transpired during this 
reporting period. 
 
 
 
¶14.  (SBU) Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet 
Napolitano, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, 
and US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice will visit Vancouver from 
February 25 to March 1.  These VIPs are tentatively scheduled to 
attend ice and speed skating venues, as well as the hockey quarter 
finals and the closing ceremonies.
