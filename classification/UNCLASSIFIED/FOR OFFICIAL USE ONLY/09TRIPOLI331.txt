¶1.  (SBU)  On April 23, Econoff delivered reftel points to Mahdi 
Mujerbi, the Director of the Office of International 
Organizations at the General People's Committee for Foreign 
Liaison and International Cooperation (Libya's MFA-equivalent). 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Mujerbi said he had received a message from the 
Libyan Mission to the United Nations in New York regarding the 
issue of Kosovo's membership in the IMF and World Bank.  He said 
he had referred the matter to the General People's Committee for 
Planning and Finance which oversees Libya's Governors on the 
Board of Governors for each body, and he was awaiting further 
instructions.  He told us he would follow-up with Post if he 
hears more on the issue.  (Note: During a recent visit to 
Tripoli, Serbia's Foreign Minister told foreign press he was 
"sure there would be no recognition of Kosovo" by Libya.  End 
note.)
