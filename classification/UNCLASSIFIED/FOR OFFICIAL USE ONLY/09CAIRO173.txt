¶1. (SBU) Summary and comment: Egypt's 53rd human avian influenza 
(AI) victim-a two-year-old girl from Shebin El-Kom, the capital of 
the Menoufiya Governorate- has recovered.  Twenty-four of the 25 
Egyptian pre-teens struck with bird flu here have now survived, 
including all 22 of those under age ten (ref A). This good news 
comes at the same time a leading daily newspaper has published a 
sensational report about a possible AI epidemic. End summary and 
comment. 
 
IS QUICK HOSPITALIZATION THE KEY TO SURVIVAL? 
 
¶2. (SBU) Egypt's Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) announced 
the latest AI case on January 25, 2009. Two aspects of the case, the 
second this year and the third this "season," deserve further 
comment.  First, the little girl from Menoufiya got sick, was 
hospitalized and received Tamiflu all on the same day: January 23, 
¶2009. Egyptians do take kids afflicted with AI to hospitals quickly. 
The average time between onset of symptoms and hospital admission 
for the pre-teen AI survivors here is only 1.4 days. The teenage and 
adult AI victims have taken a lot longer to get to the hospitals, on 
average, twice as long-over 3 days. This fact may, at least in part, 
explain why 96% of the pre-teen AI victims in Egypt lived, while 80% 
of the older victims died. Moreover, early hospital admission is, in 
all likelihood, synonymous with early administration of Tamiflu. 
ESTHOff has spoken with several Egyptian doctors who treated 
pediatric AI patients.  They said they administered Tamiflu to the 
children without waiting for proof of contact with sick poultry or 
for lab results.  The one pre-teen to die from AI in Egypt, a 
ten-year-old Qena girl who passed away June 10,2007, was not 
hospitalized until five days after she got sick, and all seven of 
the older patients who waited five days or more for hospitalization 
died. 
 
A QUICK DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENCE IN EGYPT'S CENTRAL HEALTH LABS 
¶3. (SBU) The MOHP also appears to have handled Case 53 flawlessly. 
On January 25, 2009, just two days after the young girl from 
Menoufiya sought medical treatment, MOHP's Central Laboratories 
confirmed she had AI and the Ministry, in a departure from past 
practice, disclosed the case to the public without waiting for 
NAMRU-3 to double-check Central Labs's results.  The MOHP's 
confidence in its Central Labs is well founded (ref B). Central Labs 
did eventually provide a Case 53 sample to NAMRU-3: it contained the 
H5N1 virus. 
PRESS HINTS AT EPIDEMIC 
 
¶4. (SBU) Al Masry Al-Youm, a widely read independent Egyptian 
newspaper, reported on January 30, 2009, on the large number of 
suspect AI cases in Egypt.  The report, apparently based on a MOHP 
report noting there have been 5,800 suspect AI cases in Egypt since 
2006, was carried under a banner hinting at an epidemic. While the 
headline was sensational, the number of suspect cases reported is 
consistent with what Embassy Cairo has been hearing from the MOHP 
all along. The MOHP's report apparently indicates Cairo has had the 
highest number of suspect cases, 780, followed by Gharbiya with 715, 
Kafr El-Sheikh with 499, Giza with 466 and Menoufiya, with 444. 
 
MENOUFIYA'S GRIM MILESTONE-- THE MOST CONFIRMED CASES 
 
¶5. (SBU) There appears to be no relationship between the number of 
cases suspected and the number confirmed.  With the confirmation of 
the latest case, Menoufiya, the birthplace of Egyptian Presidents 
Mubarak and Sadat, which is located in the Nile Delta about 65 
kilometers north of Cairo, is now the Egyptian Governorate most 
afflicted by human AI. Six human AI cases have been confirmed in 
Menoufiya since the H5N1 virus emerged in Egypt in early 2006. The 
Governorates of Qena, Qalubiya, Gharbiya and Fayoum trail with five 
confirmed human cases each.
