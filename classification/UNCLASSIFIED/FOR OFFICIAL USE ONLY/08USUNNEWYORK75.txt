REF: A. USUN 63 (NOTAL) 
     ¶B. USUN 64 
 
¶1. (SBU) The UN Security Council met on January 23 to 
continue discussions on the draft Presidential Statement 
(PRST) on the situation in Gaza prepared by the Arab group in 
New York and tabled by Libya.  Following a meeting of UNSC 
political coordinators the morning of January 23, in which 
USUN argued that a PRST was not necessary but several 
delegations nevertheless proposed amendments to the draft, 
the Libyan delegation introduced a revised version of the 
PRST during afternoon UNSC consultations at the Perm Rep 
level that "called on all parties to immediately cease all 
acts of violence, including the firing of rockets into 
Israeli territory," noted "Israel's decision to suspend the 
closure of the crossing points and called for it to be fully 
implemented," and "welcomed the proposal made by the PA to 
assume responsibility for the Palestinian side of the Gaza 
Strip border crossing points."  (Note: Revised text e-mailed 
to IO/UNP. End Note.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) After the Libyans circulated the text, the fourteen 
other UNSC delegations besides USUN expressed support for it 
and urged that the Council adopt a statement on Gaza as soon 
as possible.  Several delegations, including France, Italy, 
the UK, Russia, China, Croatia, and Belgium, expressed a 
willingness to make further changes to the text if that would 
help the Council reach agreement.  But Russia and China 
cautioned that any changes should not distract the PRST from 
its focus on the humanitarian situation in Gaza.  Amb Wolff 
continued to argue against a PRST in principle, explaining 
that there did not seem to be a common appreciation of the 
causes and the overall context of the current situation.  He 
also noted that the revised text still did not condemn the 
ongoing rocket firings since Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in 
2005, it did not address the illegal seizure of power in Gaza 
by Hamas in June 2007, nor did it recognize the humanitarian 
situations in both Gaza and southern Israel.  France was most 
supportive of the U.S. position, noting that although the 
revised text had brought some balance to the text, the 
Council should continue its work on January 23 in order to 
reach consensus. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Libyan PR, noting the influx of Palestinians 
into Egypt earlier on January 23 had made the situation a 
threat to regional stability, bemoaned the Council's 
inability to respond quickly to the situation on the ground. 
He then announced that the Council would reconvene at 1100 
EST on January 24 to continue discussions on the draft PRST 
and expressed the expectation that all delegations would have 
received instructions on the text by that time.
