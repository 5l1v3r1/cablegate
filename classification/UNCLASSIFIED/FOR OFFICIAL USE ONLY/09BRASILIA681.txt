¶1.  (SBU) This report provides an update on developments in Brazil 
regarding the H1N1 flu outbreak. 
 
NEW REPORTED CASES: 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Mission Brazil is monitoring the situation of four 
American citizens who are being held in quarantine at a hospital in 
the city of Palmas, state of Tocantins, under suspicion of having 
H1N1.  The individuals were admitted after experiencing H1N1 
flu-like symptoms.  None of these individuals have confirmed cases 
of H1N1, and Mission Brazil's consular officials are in contact with 
the individuals.  In addition, Embassy Brasilia has identified one 
case of suspected H1N1 infection within the Embassy community.  The 
employee was tested yesterday, May 28, and is being kept in social 
isolation.  The Mission's traveler screening program helped to 
prevent a situation in which the employee could have infected 
co-workers within the Embassy. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) As of May 29, 2009 the Brazilian Ministry of Health has 
confirmed 14 cases of the H1N1 flu spread throughout five of 
Brazil's 26 states and the Federal District.  In addition, health 
officials continue to monitor 20 suspected cases spread throughout 
nine states. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) To date, 12 of the 14 confirmed came from individuals who 
began to experience flu-like symptoms shortly after returning from 
trips to the United States or Mexico.  The other two cases have 
occurred from person to person transmission within the country.  The 
Ministry of Health confirmed on Thursday, May 28 that the four most 
recent cases of the H1N1 flu in Brazil resulted from individuals 
infected by the virus during trips to the United States. 
 
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS: 
 
¶5.  (SBU) On May 29, the Brazilian newspaper "O Globo" published an 
article criticizing the H1N1 alert system being used at Antonio 
Carlos Jobim International Airport in Rio de Janeiro.  The report 
criticized airport and health officials for using an H1N1 alert in 
English that was grammatically "incomprehensible."
