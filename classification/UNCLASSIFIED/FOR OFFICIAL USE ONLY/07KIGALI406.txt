SUBJECT: AMIS NON-PAYMENT JEOPARDIZES RWANDAN INVOLVEMENT 
IN DARFUR 
 
REF: KIGALI 340 
 
¶1. (U) The African Union continues to owe the GOR 
approximately USD 20 million, which amounts to 0.7% of GDP, 
for funds expended in the African Union Mission in Sudan 
(AMIS). 
 
¶2. (SBU) The IMF, during the latest Poverty Reduction Growth 
Facility (PRGF) mission to Rwanda, advised the GOR to 
consider reducing their engagement and to eventually pull out 
of the African Union (AU) mission, as this increased debt 
threatens Rwanda's macroeconomic stability. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In the new memorandum of understanding (MOU) the GOR 
will sign with the IMF on the PRGF, the Minister of Finance 
has agreed to cut spending (presumably to match the missing 
USD 20 million) if the AU does not honor its reimbursement 
obligation. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT. Although there does not appear to be an 
IMF-imposed timeline for action by the GOR, the non-payment 
from the AU for Rwanda's peace keeping mission in Darfur 
could have grave implications for Rwanda and AMIS.  Either 
the GOR will have to cut the equivalent of 3% of their 
already-small budget or the GOR will end up withdrawing its 
three battalions from Darfur.
