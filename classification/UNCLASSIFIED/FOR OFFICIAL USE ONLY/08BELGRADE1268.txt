Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) At its weekly session on November 20, the Serbian 
government (GOS) endorsed the appointment of seven new ambassadors, 
even though we later learned from MFA contacts that the government 
had not yet requested agrement for the ambassadors-designate.  This 
lapse of diplomatic protocol may come back to bite the GOS.  The 
appointments generated significant press coverage due to the public 
profile of two of the appointees, former Politika daily 
editor-in-chief Ljiljana Smajlovic and former Serbian Ambassador to 
Washington Milan St. Protic, and it would be embarrassing for the 
government if agrement is not secured.  End Summary.

biographies for the ambassadors-designate.  Biographic information 
for the additional two appointees, Ivo Viskovic to Berlin and 
Stanislav Stakic to Rabat, is not yet available and will be 
forwarded septel.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The failure to seek agrement before announcing these 
ambassadorial appointments unfortunately is symbolic of a broader 
lack of professionalism in the MFA.  In a recent interview, former 
Serbian Ambassador to the Vatican and Turkey Darko Tanaskovic spoke 
about the increasing number of diplomatic gaffes caused by Serbian 
diplomats' inexperience and ignorance and advocated for a personnel 
system that would value merit over party or political affiliation. 
Introducing such a system would begin to address the endemic 
deficiencies that afflict the Serbian diplomatic corps and perhaps 
prevent debacles such as the role played by Serbian Consulate staff 
in New York in helping fugitive Miladin Kovacevic flee to Serbia. 
End Comment.
