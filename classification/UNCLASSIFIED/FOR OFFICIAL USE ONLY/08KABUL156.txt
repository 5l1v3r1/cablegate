SUBJECT:  Iran Suspends Deportations In Face Of Strong Afghan 
Government Protests 
 
Ref:  Kabul 97 
 
¶1. (SBU) Iran has suspended its deportation of Afghans after the 
Afghan government protested in the media and summoned the Iranian 
charge d'affaires twice to demand a halt to the mid-winter 
expulsions.  In the first two weeks of January, Iran deported more 
than 9,000 Afghans, who were forced over the border into the worst 
weather that western Afghanistan has seen in many years.  While most 
deportees are single men working illegally in Iran and not normally 
considered "vulnerable" by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR), the extreme weather conditions prompted UNHCR to provide 
humanitarian assistance and transportation from the Islam Qala 
border to Herat City.  The Afghan Red Crescent and U.S. Forward 
Operating Base Camp Stone, working with the Afghan National Army, 
also provided blankets and transportation to deportees facing 
potentially lethal conditions at the border. 
 
(2) (SBU) At UNHCR's urging, the Afghan government has been 
increasingly vocal about Iran's harsh deportation policy. Iran 
deported 365,000 unregistered Afghans in 2007 and recently announced 
it would incarcerate unregistered Afghans (Ref A).  As heavy snow 
caused many human and livestock fatalities in the Herat region, a 
January 9 Kabul Times article quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
spokesman as saying the MFA had discussed the issue with the Iranian 
charge d'affaires and sent a letter expressing concern.  The media 
continued to cover the daily deportations, and on January 16, the 
Afghan Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Kabi Farahi again summoned 
the Iranian charge, reportedly calling the deportations a "human 
tragedy."  The Afghan government's outspokenness contrasts with its 
relatively passive stance in spring 2007, despite international 
protests against the deportation surge.  The government's lack of 
response led to the parliament passing no confidence votes against 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Refugees and 
Repatriation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Department of Refugees and Repatriation officials in Herat 
confirmed Radio Azadi reports on the afternoon of January 16 that 
Iran indeed suspended the deportations.  The Afghan MFA has not yet 
been officially informed, and no details are available as to how 
long the suspension will last.  The Afghan-Iran-UNHCR Tripartite 
Commission meets in late January in Kabul, where Afghan and UNHCR 
will undoubtedly argue for suspension until warmer weather arrives 
in March.  UNHCR is likely to encourage the Afghans and the new 
Minister for Refugees and Repatriation to continue to take a strong 
stance on deportations in these and future negotiations.
