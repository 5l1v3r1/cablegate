¶1. (SBU) Summary. An Avian Influenza Action Group (AIAG) funded 
Avian Influenza (AI) documentary aired on Indonesian television on 
July 14.  The CDC acquired draft quarterly reports from NIHRD 
covering the past three fiscal quarters. A new CDC senior medical 
epidemiologist arrived at post on August 1.  The Indonesian National 
Committee for Avian Influenza Control and Pandemic Influenza 
Preparedness (KOMNAS) hosted a meeting on August 6-7 to develop a 
new national pandemic preparedness plan.  The KOMNAS is planning a 
high-level meeting on September 11-13 to map GOI and donor funds and 
programs for AI control in Indonesia. The Department of Defense 
(DOD) conducted training on influenza rapid response and pandemic 
preparedness for the Indonesian military on July 16.  The Indonesian 
Ministry of Health (MOH) reports that it would like to conduct a 
field containment exercise in September. The MOH has reported two 
new H5N1 infections with one fatality since last reftel.  End 
Summary. 
 
AI DOCUMENTARY AIRS ON METRO TV 
-------------------------------- 
2.(U) An AIAG-funded documentary aired on Indonesia's only all news 
channel, Metro TV, on July 14.  The documentary, coordinated by PAS 
Jakarta, reported on best practices to combat AI in Singapore, 
Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia.  The purpose of the program was to 
promote public awareness of the dangers of AI and to share best 
practices from other affected countries.  Metro TV plans to air the 
documentary again on August 11 and estimates that about 700,000 
viewers will watch. 
 
NEW CDC STAFF MEMBER ARRIVES AT POST 
------------------------------------- 
¶3. (U) Dr. Frank Mahoney, a new senior medical epidemiologist from 
CDC, arrived at post on August 1. Dr. Mahoney will work with Dr. 
Thomas and the Director of the Indonesian CDC. 
 
CDC MEETS WITH NIHRD STAFF 
-------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) Dr. Mike Thomas of the CDC met with officials from NIHRD to 
help write their CDC grant renewal proposal.  During the meeting, 
CDC acquired draft quarterly reports from NIHRD covering the past 
three fiscal quarters.  This marks the first time CDC has received 
an update from NIHRD this fiscal year. 
 
GOI AND PARTNERS DEVELOP PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS PLAN 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
¶5. (SBU) USAID's Community Based Avian Influenza Control (CBAIC) 
Program sponsored a GOI-hosted meeting in Bogor on August 6-7 to 
develop a new national pandemic preparedness plan for a global 
influenza pandemic.  The meeting covered issues such as surveillance 
and detection, isolation and quarantine, public health and 
treatment, business and critical-infrastructure continuity, and 
national recovery and rehabilitation. KOMNAS estimates the rollout 
of the new pandemic preparedness plan to be in early 2008, with a 
detailed outline completed in time for the September 11-13 funding 
meeting (see paragraph 5).  The plan will build on the 2005 
Indonesian National Strategic Plan for Avian Influenza Control and 
Pandemic Influenza Preparedness, as well as strategies developed by 
government ministries, the police and military.  Meeting 
participants included several GOI ministries, the military, the 
police, local government officials, private sector representatives, 
and international representatives, including WHO, USAID, USDA, US 
CDC, AusAID, and ASEAN. 
 
KOMNAS PLANS MEETING TO MAP AI FUNDING 
--------------------------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) KOMNAS is planning a high-level meeting to map GOI and 
donor funds and programs for AI control in Indonesia and to 
influence the GOI's 2008 budget process.  KOMNAS has tentatively 
scheduled the meeting for September 11-13, 2007.  The meeting will 
take stock of where Indonesia is one year after a similar meeting 
that David Nabarro of the UN attended. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The 2006 meeting was the first effort to map GOI and donor 
resources and to reevaluate the GOI National Strategy.  The 2006 
meeting resulted in the GOI prioritizing three components of their 
 
JAKARTA 00002182  002 OF 002 
 
 
national strategy: 1) behavior change communications and risk 
communications, 2) integrated animal and human surveillance, and 3) 
control of AI in animals.  Results of the 2006 mapping exercise 
revealed a mismatch between GOI strategic priorities with both GOI 
and donor resource commitments, with roughly 70 percent of funds 
directed toward human health and the MOH while the strategic 
priority is control in animals. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The intent of the 2007 meeting is to help influence GOI 
budget decisions through a reexamination of funding distribution and 
progress made to-date in filling key gaps identified in 2006. 
KOMNAS is fully engaging GOI ministries and donors in planning for 
this meeting.  On July 18, KOMNAS hosted a donor planning meeting 
attend by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Health 
Organization (WHO), World Bank, USAID, Government of Japan, the 
German Society for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), UN Development 
Program (UNDP), and the Community Based Avian Influenza (CBAIC) 
project (USAID contract).  KOMNAS has already begun collecting 
budget and program detail from donors and GOI ministries and will 
intensify this effort during the next few weeks. 
 
DOD DELIVERS TRAINING TO INDONESIAN MILITARY 
--------------------------------------------- 
¶9. (U) On July 16, the Department of Defense (DOD) conducted 
training on influenza rapid response and pandemic preparedness. 
Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) sponsored the session.  Over 40 students 
from the Indonesian Armed Forces attended.  The MOH facilitated the 
session, and the UN and WHO participated. 
 
MOH PLANS FIELD CONTAINMENT EXERCISE 
------------------------------------- 
¶10. (SBU) During the DOD training, MOH officials indicated that the 
MOH has invited the Indonesian military to assist with developing 
their Emergency Response Plan in conjunction with the Indonesian 
Disaster Management Group. MOH contacts also stated that they would 
like to conduct a field containment exercise near Jakarta in early 
September.  The MOH is pushing to conduct the exercise this fiscal 
year. The MOH has asked for samples of other field containment 
exercises to use as a template. 
 
AI HUMAN CASE REPORTS 
----------------------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) The MOH reported two new human AI infections since last 
reftel. A 3-year-old girl from Riau Province developed symptoms on 
June 18.  She has since recovered. Investigations indicate that the 
cause of her infection was exposure to sick and dead poultry. A 
six-year-old girl from Banten Province died on July 8.  Verification 
of the infections has not been determined at either NAMRU-2 or a 
laboratory outside of NIHRD.  As of August 10, the MOH reports 102 
human cases and 81 fatalities.
