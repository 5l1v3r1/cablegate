¶1. The United States and Moldova conduct Bilateral 
Defense Consultations every two years with the 
location traditionally rotating between the United 
States and Moldova.  As part of the U.S. 
Department of Defense's bilateral relationship 
with Moldova, these consultations are designed to 
review the bilateral defense relationship and 
chart future areas for cooperation.  The first 
defense consultations that we are aware of took 
place in 1997.  The agreement to conduct bilateral 
defense consultations appears to have been an 
informal one between the two countries, as neither 
the Embassy's Defense Attach Office nor the 
Moldovan Ministry of Defense has any record of a 
formal agreement. 
 
¶2. The last Bilateral Defense Consultations took 
place January 11-12 in Washington, D.C.  The 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
Russia/Ukraine and Eurasia, Dr. Celeste Wallander, 
chaired the event.  Other senior U.S. attendees 
were Major General Ingram, the North Carolina 
National Guard Adjutant General, Brigadier General 
Ramirez, the United States European Command Deputy 
J5, and Ambassador Chaudhry.  The Moldovan 
delegation consisted of six individuals from the 
Ministry of Defense and two from the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  The head of the Moldovan 
delegation was Minister of Defense Vitalie 
Marinuta. 
 
¶3. The next Bilateral Defense Consultations are 
tentatively planned for late 2011 in North 
Carolina.  If the event occurs as planned, it 
would be hosted by the North Carolina National 
Guard Adjutant General.
