EARTHQUAKE 
 
 
¶1. (U) According to the United States Geological Survey, an 
earthquake registering 7.5 on the Richter Scale hit 140 miles 
southwest of Beira, Mozambique at 12:19 AM Central Africa 
Time (CAT) on 23 February 2006.  The epicenter was at 
Espungabera, a small town right on Zimbabwe's eastern border 
with Mozambique.  The earthquake was followed by two 
aftershocks in the same area at 3:23 AM CAT (registering 5.4 
on the Richter Scale) and at 4:22 AM CAT (registering 5.3 on 
the Richter Scale).  Residents throughout Zimbabwe felt the 
original tremor while only residents near the Mozambique 
border felt the aftershocks. 
 
¶2. (U) Residents of Harare, Mutare, and other Zimbabwean 
cities poured into the streets as they felt and heard 
buildings rattle and shake.  Thus far, according to official 
GOZ press, there have been no reports of injuries or damage 
to property.  Mr. Munyaradzi Mukandi, a geologist at the 
Zimbabwe Geological Survey Department, told EmbStaff that 
they had received no reports of injuries or property damage. 
In Mutare, a town on the border with Mozambique, suspended 
Mayor M.T. Kagurabadza told PolOff on February 23 that he had 
not heard or seen any injuries or property damage. 
Manicaland Publicity Association Director Fadzi Mugwagwa told 
PolOff on February 23 that she had heard no reports of 
injuries but had one unconfirmed report of cracks in the 
foundation of one building.  She was still to identify the 
building and to confirm the extent of damage, if any. 
 
¶3. (U) The earthquake was a surprise for Zimbabweans as 
southern Africa is not traditionally known as earthquake 
territory.  However, the unexpected event is the talk of the 
town today, providing a distraction for residents from the 
country,s political and economic crises.
