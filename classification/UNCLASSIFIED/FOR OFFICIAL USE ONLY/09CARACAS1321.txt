SUBJECT: GBRV "SURPRISED" ABOUT THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The Venezuelan government (GBRV) reacted 
immediately and strongly to the October 9 news that President 
Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize.  Venezuela's Public 
Defender Gabriela Ramirez said early that morning on the 
government-owned VTV the award "made a mockery of human 
rights," and the government Agencia Bolivariana de Noticias 
issued a press release with her statement.  Shortly after 
noon Minister of Foreign Affairs Nicolas Maduro said he was 
"surprised" at the announcement, since "Obama has only just 
begun."  He suggested Obama demonstrate his commitment to 
peace by ending the U.S. use of Colombian military bases. 
 
¶2.  (U) President Chavez criticized the decision in his 
weekly column "Las Lineas de Chavez" October 11, asking "What 
has Obama done to merit this prize?" After accusing the jury 
of forgetting President Obama's "determination to keep troops 
in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his decision to establish new 
military bases in Colombia," Chavez said it was like giving a 
baseball pitcher a Cy Young award at the beginning of a 
season.
