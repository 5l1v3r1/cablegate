¶1. (SBU) Afghan Telecom (AfTel), Afghanistan's state-owned 
telecommunications company, has now been operating for two months 
without a formally designated president/CEO.  The Minister of 
Communications, Amirzai Sangin, is currently acting as president/CEO 
of the company.  Sangin fired Aftel's President/CEO, Jamal Nasser 
Noorzaie, in late November.  Embassy has received reports from 
sources within the Ministry that Noorzaie was fired at least in part 
because of allegations of corruption centering on a fuel contract 
for AfTel's corporate vehicle fleet.  A U.S./Afghan dual national, 
Noorzaie was not arrested or charged with a crime; he left the 
country immediately after being dismissed. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Noorzaie's performance after three years of running AfTel 
was reportedly coming under question from Sangin.  Despite 
considerable progress in corporatizing the company, Noorzaie had not 
managed to assemble a strong management team, and efforts to grow 
the company's subscriber base from less than one percent total 
penetration had largely foundered.  Sangin has set aggressive goals 
for strengthening AfTel's subscriber base to several times its 
current size and improving the company's operations to attract a 
foreign investor.  Further details on AfTel's build-out efforts and 
prospects for privatization will follow via septel.
