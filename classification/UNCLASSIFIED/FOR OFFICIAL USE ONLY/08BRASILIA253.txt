EXTENSION OF FRAMEWORK SPACE COOPERATION AGREEMENT 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Per REFTEL, Post delivered a diplomatic note to the 
Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MRE) regarding the extension 
of the Space Cooperation Agreement on February 25, 2008. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On February 22, 2008, ESTH Counselor briefed the Head of 
the Ministry of External Relations' (MRE) Division of Maritime, 
Antarctic and Space Affairs, Bernardo Velloso, of this decision to 
be willing to extend the agreement.  Velloso was very pleased with 
this development. He also recognized that this extension would give 
both sides time to negotiate revisions to the agreement. 
 
ISS SUSPENSION UPDATE 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On a related subject, Velloso said that he expected soon 
to be able to send the USG a response to the diplomatic note 
delivered on May 24, 2007, which expressed the USG's intention to 
suspend the Implementing Arrangement concerning the design and 
construction of the International Space Station (ISS).  He said that 
he expected the MRE's lawyers to complete their work shortly and he 
would then send the corresponding reply diplomatic note, which would 
cause the suspension to enter into effect.  He did not foresee any 
substantive or technical reasons why the note should be delayed much 
longer. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) COMMENT. Although on the surface the matters are not 
directly linked together, we believe that the agreement to extend 
the Framework Agreement should help to expedite the Brazilian side 
responding to the ISS suspension diplomatic note.  Further, Vellos 
understands that the USG has an option to exercise its right to 
terminate - rather than just suspend - the ISS agreement if this 
matter drags on too long.  END COMMENT.
