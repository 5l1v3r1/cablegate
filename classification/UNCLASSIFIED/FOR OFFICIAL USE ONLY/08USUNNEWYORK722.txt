     ¶B. NOTE FROM CHAIR OF 1737 COMMITTEE 
        (S/AC.50/2008/COMM.80) 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) USUN delivered ref A demarche on August 11 to Cui 
Wei, attach at the Chinese Mission to the UN, about China's 
recent authorization of payments from Bank Sepah of Iran (ref 
B).  USUN requested that China provide more information about 
these transactions, including the types of contract or 
payment involved, details about the underlying goods, 
information about the parties involved and whether the funds 
are now in China. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Cui said he will work with Beijing to provide a 
timely response to our questions.  Noting the recent 
distribution of a P3 list of banks domiciled in Iran and 
their branches/subsidiaries, he said Beijing had noticed that 
Washington was paying particularly close attention to the 
implementation of UNSCR provisions regarding Iranian 
financial institutions.  USUN confirmed this was indeed true.
