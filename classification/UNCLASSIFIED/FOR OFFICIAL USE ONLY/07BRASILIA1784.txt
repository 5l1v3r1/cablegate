¶1.  (U) THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED AND NOT FOR 
INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On September 18, the Embassy's Environment, Science, 
Technology and Health (ESTH) Counselor met with Paulo Chiarelli, 
acting Director of the Ministry of Exterior Relations' (MRE) 
Division of Environmental Policy and Sustainable Development 
(MRE/DPAD), which is coordinating the Government of Brazil's (GOB) 
participation in climate change negotiations.  Earlier on September 
14, the ESTH Office delivered to the Acting Ministry of Energy, 
Nelson Hubner, the letter from Energy Secretary Bodman, which 
encouraged the Energy Ministry to include a representative in the 
GOB's delegation to the Major Economies Meeting (MEM) (REF D). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Chiarelli said the GOB delegation would be as follows: 
 
-- Head of Delegation - MRE Under Secretary for Policy Amb. Everton 
Vargas 
-- Ministry of the Environment - Dr. Thelma Krugg, Secretary for 
Climate Change and Environmental Quality 
-- Ministry of Science and Technology - Dr.Jose Domingos Gonzalez 
Miguez, General Coordinator for Global Climate Change 
-- One more person yet to be designated.  (Note. Chiarelli thought 
it would possibly be someone from the Brazilian Embassy in 
Washington.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) ESTH Counselor urged the GOB to include a representative 
from the Energy Ministry.  Chiarelli indicated that this is still a 
possibility.  After the MEM, this GOB delegation will go on to New 
York for the climate change discussion there. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  With regard to the information for the matrices requested 
in REF B, Chiarelli said the GOB technical experts were working on 
gathering the information requested.  He noted that the GOB had been 
given little time and that the matrices were difficult to work with. 
 He stated the GOB will be providing information, but it probably 
would not be in the format of the matrices.
