¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Jordan has been discussing a number of Jordan 
Valley projects with the Israelis over the past several years. 
Several would be contingent upon financial support from Japan.  All 
are likely to be discussed in the four-party talks between Japan, 
Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Territory being held in Tokyo 
March 14.  The proposals include constructing a bridge, creating 
rail links between Israel and Jordan, and implementing a 
comprehensive plan to develop the Palestinian side of the Jordan 
Valley through constructing industrial facilities and promoting 
agricultural industries.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In Israeli press reports, Vice Premier Shimon Peres refers 
to the Japanese initiative as the "Peace Valley" plan, but Japanese 
press reports use the name "Corridor for Peace and Prosperity." 
Four party talks between Japan, Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian 
Authority are being held in Tokyo March 14.  According to press 
reports, projects under consideration will include the Red Sea-Dead 
Sea water conveyance, tourism projects, a joint Israeli-Jordanian 
airport at Aqaba, eventual integration of industrial complexes and 
goods distribution centers in the Jordan Valley, and promoting 
agricultural industries in the Jordan Valley targeting Gulf markets. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Amr Al-Hadidi, the Secretary General of Jordan's Ministry 
of Transportation, told ECOUNS March 13 that there have been 
discussions with the Israelis over the past two years on building a 
new bridge between Israel and Jordan.  The bridge would be in the 
southern Jordan Valley near the Allenby Bridge, also known as the 
King Hussein crossing.  Both parties hope Japan could help fund 
construction of the bridge but the Japanese government has so far 
made no commitments. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In addition, the Jordanian government is completing a 
railway master plan which should be completed by April.  As part of 
this plan, a feasibility study is being carried out looking at 
establishing rail links with Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. 
Al-Hadidi has met with Israel's Secretary General for Transportation 
to discuss the proposal.  However, Al-Hadidi said the Jordanians 
were exploring the Israeli rail link option quietly because of 
concern that the Syrians and Saudis "might be hesitant" if they 
learn of the planned rail links to Israel.  Al-Hadidi added that the 
plan would be based on standard gauge track, not the narrow gauge 
track currently existing in Jordan (from the famous Hejaz Railway). 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) According the Jordan office of the Japan International 
Cooperation Agency (JICA), the JICA offices in Tel Aviv and the West 
Bank have been directly involved in developing the plan.  However, 
he did assert that the Tokyo talks would review the proposed 
comprehensive plan for the Palestinian side of the Jordan Valley. 
JICA would be involved in financing projects under the plan if the 
four parties reach agreement in the talks.
