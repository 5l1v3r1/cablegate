¶1. (U) Summary: After two derailments in November, the 
earliest date Taiwan's high-speed rail can receive 
authorization from the Taiwan authorities to begin 
operations is December 25.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) After a series of technical setbacks, Taiwan's 
high-speed rail project has again delayed its opening. 
Test trains derailed on November 2 and November 24. 
Neither incident caused injuries or major damage, but 
both were widely reported in the media and elicited 
public concern.  In response to the accidents, the 
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) 
High-Speed Rail Inspection Review Committee imposed new 
requirements on the Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corporation 
(THRSC). 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to MOTC High-Speed Rail Bureau Section 
Chief Allen Hu, the committee imposed two major 
requirements.  First, the high-speed rail must successful 
run test trains for a full month with no accidents. 
Second, it must conduct daily test runs of its rush hour 
schedule for two weeks with no accidents.  Hu explained 
the one-month period for accident free testing started 
from the November 24 derailment.  The earliest date it 
can fulfill the requirement is December 24.  He said 
THSRC had begun the rush hour tests on December 7, 
running 9 trains between 10:00 and 11:30 am and one train 
per hour the rest of the day.  If no accidents occur, the 
two-week rush hour test period will conclude December 21. 
Hu believes that THSRC should be able to meet both 
requirements.  If it does, MOTC will be able to approve 
certification as early as December 25, the first work day 
after the conclusion of the test period. 
 
¶4. (SBU) THSRC had scheduled an opening ceremony for the 
high-speed rail on December 7.  It also planned a two- 
week promotional period during which it would invite 
selected guests to ride the new train free of charge. 
Public relations staff at THSRC informed AIT that the 
opening ceremony had been cancelled with no plans to 
reschedule it.  THSRC was not able to provide any 
information about what kind of promotional operations it 
might conduct before regular operations commence.
