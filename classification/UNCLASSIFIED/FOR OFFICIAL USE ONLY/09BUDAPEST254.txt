STRATEGIC REVIEW 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 29482 
     ¶B. BUDAPEST 197 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered ref A demarche to the MFA's NATO 
Section Head Peter Sztaray on March 27.  Sztaray who had the 
lead in preparing Hungary's response to the USG's request for 
inputs to the AFPAK strategy review, commented that the white 
paper is "in line with our views" on the way forward (ref B). 
 He noted that Hungary will restate its commitments at the 
upcoming ministerial to provide additional forces during the 
August elections in Afghanistan, as well as the deployment of 
a second Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team later this 
year.  Sztaray also raised the French-led proposal to create 
a 300-500 person Gendarmerie training contingent in 
conjunction with Italy, Spain, Portugal, Romania and possibly 
Greece as a potential force-multiplier in training the Afghan 
National Police (ANP).  However, Margit Szucz, the MFA's 
Afghan Desk Officer, commented that it is still unclear as to 
what relationship the proposed contingent would have with 
current ANP training efforts underway, the impact on EUPOL 
manning, as well as questions of funding for the proposed 
unit. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The DAO also presented the demarche to the MOD's 
Security Policy State Secretary Jozsef Bali on March 27. 
Bali noted that Hungary will review the document and will be 
ready to discuss at the upcoming NATO summit.  The GOH will 
present a united front concerning policies in Afghanistan and 
the region, and will continue to do its part in the on-going 
missions.
