     ¶B. MADRID 1833 
 
¶1.  We sent reftel A talking points in a letter welcoming 
Spain,s new Director General of Civil Aviation Manuel 
Bautista Perez and requesting an introductory appointment. 
To our surprise, Bautista responded notifying us of the GOS's 
"intent" to establish an open skies relationship. 
 
¶2.  An informal translation of the relevant paragraphs follow: 
 
Begin informal translation: 
As you already know, Spain actively takes part in the (US-EU) 
negotiations that are being held, and has supported with 
determination the work directed at reaching greater 
cooperation in competitive matters, common regulation and 
progressive market access liberalization for the companies of 
both parties. 
 
On the other hand, and as it was declared in previous 
occasions to the Embassy as well as to representatives of the 
Department of State and Department of Transportation of the 
United States, Spain has the intention of establishing an 
open skies relationship with the United States which permits 
resolution, as soon as possible, of the current disadvantaged 
situation of Spanish companies compared with companies of 
other Member States that have concluded open skies agreements 
with the U.S. 
 
End Translation 
 
¶3.  Bautista also promised to contact us "as soon as 
possible" to set up a meeting.  We will clarify with him 
Spain's willingness to enter into bilateral open skies 
negotiations. 
 
¶4.  Comment:  The GOS has expressed concern several times 
before about the unequal status of Spanish airlines compared 
with airlines of member states with open skies agreements 
(see ref B).  But this is the first time the GOS has 
expressed an "intention of establishing an open skies 
relationship" that is not contingent upon the consent of 
Brussels.  We will seek more detail about GOS plans when we 
meet with Bautista.  End Comment.
