--------------------------- 
 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Micheal Martin, T.D., 
welcomed the announcement today by President Obama of his 
Administration's review of US Policy in Iraq, including the 
substantial reduction in troop numbers by 31 August 2010. 
 
The Minister said: "This early elaboration of U.S. policy, 
coming on foot of the commitments made in the U.S.-Iraq 
Security Agreement, provides a welcome indication of the new 
Administration's commitment to move forward with a 
responsible withdrawal of troops in Iraq.  This is coupled 
with the reassurance that the necessary supports, security 
and otherwise, will continue to be provided to the people of 
Iraq over the transitional period ahead, including the 
forthcoming elections." 
 
The Minister also welcomed the U.S. Administration's 
continuing work with the Iraqi Government, as it addresses 
the challenges of rebuilding the political and administrative 
structures within Iraq and its relations within the region, 
with a view to securing long term peace and stability. 
 
"We have long looked forward to the day when the Iraqi 
authorities would be able to provide for the security of 
their people without outside assistance.  President Obama's 
welcome announcement today shows that we are coming much 
closer to that point," the Minister said.

¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  Martin's statements accurately reflect 
the sentiments of both the Irish government and the Irish 
people.  We expect that Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen will 
note his government's support of President Obama's new 
initiatives when Cowen meets the President at the White House 
on March 17 (St. Patrick's Day).
