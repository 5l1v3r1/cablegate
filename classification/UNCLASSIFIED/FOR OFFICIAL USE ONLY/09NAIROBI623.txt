------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Transitional Federal Government's (TFG) new 
Minister of Information, Farahan Ali Mohamed, is making an 
effort to revisit and ratify the media law that was endorsed 
by Parliament in 2007 but never signed by former TFG 
President Abdullahi Yusuf.  Several journalist associations 
are involved in advocacy on behalf of the media, who seek 
legal protection from the threats against freedom of the 
press in Somalia.  We are in contact with both the Minister 
and the journalists, working to ensure both parties remain 
aware of our desire to see a free and vibrant press in 
Somalia, where the media has suffered countless threats in 
the past 18 years.  End summary. 
 
--------------------- 
The Journalists' View 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The National Media Council (NMC) of Somalia, an 
association of fifteen members called for in the draft media 
law, has embarked on an effort to revisit and have ratified 
Somalia's media law, which was endorsed by Parliament in 2007 
but never signed by former Transitional Federal Government 
(TFG) President Abdullahi Yusuf (reftel).  Somalia is cited 
by one organization as the one of the most dangerous places 
in the world, second only to Iraq, for media practitioners, 
and nearly twenty journalists have been killed in Somalia in 
the past two years.  Although we have heard of no complaints 
since the advent of the Sharif administration, in the past 
journalists often lamented that the TFG was as much of a 
threat to them as extremist elements in Somalia.  They told 
us that if they reported favorably on the TFG, the extremists 
came after them, and vice-versa.  Journalists appear to be 
pursuing the media law as a vehicle for protection from 
threats to their safety more than as a guide for their 
activities. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The NMC has offered a two-page list of suggestions 
on the draft media law.  Most of the suggestions pertain to 
the autonomy of the NMC, objecting to any limitations put on 
the council by the media law.  While the TFG is not likely to 
grant each of these wishes, such as turning the state-run 
outlets into community-run outlets, many of the comments are 
reflective of the generally immature media environment in 
Somalia.  As noted below, the Minister of Information has 
told us that he hopes for a more substantial discussion on 
the law before it is presented for ratification. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Somali Coalition for Freedom of Expression 
(SOCFEX) claims to have drafted the original law in April of 
2007 and remains engaged in the process.  SOCFEX has called 
for international and Somalia media organizations to 
undertake various tasks, with the goal of passing this media 
law.  From international organizations, SOCFEX calls for 
funds and expertise.  From the Somali organizations, SOCFEX 
calls for coordination, activism, and public education. 
SOCFEX will hold a Canada-funded workshop in Nairobi in 
coming weeks to discuss the media law. 
 
--------------------- 
The Government's View 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Prompted by the NMC, the new Minister of 
Information, Farahan Ali Mohamed, has promised to engage 
vigorously on this issue.  Farahan told us recently that he 
is eager to work with the journalists to create a mutually 
acceptable and beneficial law, and then see the law through 
to signature by the President.  However, he noted that the 
journalists have so far offered only minor changes from the 
2007 version and he has proposed a major review of the law, 
even going so far as to ask for Post's suggestions on 
possible amendments to the draft law.  He told us he is 
"searching for the best way to clear the air," but claims to 
be constrained by lack of a staff and other resources in his 
ministry.

Post's Involvement 
------------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) Post is in direct contact with the Minister of 
Information and other TFG officials, as well as with several 
journalist groups.  We continue to emphasize the importance 
of a free press in Somalia and the media's role in rebuilding 
the country.  Having positive relationships with both the TFG 
and journalists, we believe we play an important coordinating 
role among all parties concerned with formation of this law.
