SUBJECT: RISING TENSIONS AS PUBLIC HEALTHCARE WORKERS 
PROTEST LACK OF SALARIES IN THE WEST BANK 
 
REF: JERUSALEM 2245 
 
¶1.  (SBU) According to Palestinian daily Al-Ayyam, public 
healthcare workers took to the streets in separate, 
uncoordinated protests in Bethlehem, Nablus, and Ramallah 
June 6.  Al-Ayyam reported that the protesters hailed from 
various health institutions and marched informally, carrying 
signs that called on the PA to pay their salaries and on the 
international community to resume assistance to the PA. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) A Bethlehem doctor from a private clinic reported 
to EconOff June 8 that the protests in Bethlehem did not 
reach the level of an organized strike.  He said the protest 
was precipitated by a confrontation between a doctor at Beit 
Jala hospital and a patient's family who beat up the doctor 
when he refused to provide priority treatment for the 
patient.  In response, his colleagues at the hospital 
gathered with healthcare workers from nearby hospitals and 
clinics to protest their increased patient caseload and lack 
of salary payments. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Al-Ayyam reported that tens of protesters in Nablus 
called for their salaries to be paid and asked local banks 
not to surrender to international pressure, but to deal with 
the PA.  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 
health field officer told EconOff June 8 that he had visited 
Rafidi hospital in Nablus June 6 and had not heard of the 
strikes, noting that the hospital was operating normally. 
The Al-Ayyam article also noted that public healthcare 
workers in Ramallah had marched from the Ramallah 
Governmental hospital to downtown Ramallah, calling for the 
PA to pay their salaries. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  It does not appear that these protests 
were coordinated.  While there were reports of some delays at 
a few healthcare facilities, most operations continued as 
normal.  End Comment.
