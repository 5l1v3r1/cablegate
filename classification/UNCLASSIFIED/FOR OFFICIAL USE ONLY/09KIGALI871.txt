¶1. (SBU) During a December 16 cabinet meeting, the Government 
of Rwanda (GOR) designated Jacques Kabare to serve as 
Rwanda's next ambassador to France, less than a month after 
the two countries announced their intention to reestablish 
diplomatic ties.  Since approximately 2005, Kabare has headed 
the legal department at the African Development Bank (AfDB). 
Before that, he served as personal assistant to Rwanda's 
former finance minister, Donald Kaberuka, and was part the 
campaign team that was behind Kaberuka's successful bid to 
become AfDB chairman. Kabare was a member of the commission 
that drafted Rwanda's 2003 constitution, and was also a legal 
advisor in the finance ministry. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bio Note: Kabare was born and raised in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and received a law degree 
from the University of Kinshasa. He also completed a master's 
degree in law in Belgium. He is a member of the ruling Rwanda 
Patriotic Front party.
