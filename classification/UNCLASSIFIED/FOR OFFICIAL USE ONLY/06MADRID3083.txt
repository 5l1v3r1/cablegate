¶1. (SBU)   Poloff delivered ref. A demarche to Miriam 
Alvarez, Spanish MFA Deputy Subdirector General for the 
United Nations, on December 20.  After consulting with New 
York and the MFA Director General in charge of UN affairs, 
Alvarez informed Poloff on December 21 that the debate was 
ongoing in New York, but said that Spain understands the 
United States position and will continue working toward a 
consensus agreement.  She noted that Spain could not speak on 
behalf of the entire EU, but she promised to convey our 
position to other European delegations in New York.  Alvarez 
also mentioned that a Chinese diplomat had paid a visit to 
their office on the same topic on December 20. 
 
¶2. (SBU)   Ref. B summarizes Spain's position from October 
2006: Spain understands that the 22 percent ceiling is a red 
line for the United States, but it would appreciate 
assurances that the U.S. will fully clear its arrears and pay 
its dues in a timely fashion, as well as making a significant 
contribution to the UN Capital Master Plan.
