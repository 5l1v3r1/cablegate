¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On May 22, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) 
confirmed three additional cases of A/H1N1 Influenza in 
Germany, increasing the total number of confirmed cases to 
seventeen.  Of the three new cases, a six-year-old girl who 
attends a day care center in Duesseldorf contracted the virus 
- presumably from her parents.  In response, the day care has 
shut down operations for the next two weeks.  This is the 
first reported child case of H1N1 in Germany.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
Three new cases of H1N1 in North Rhine-Westphalia 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  A German couple from the state of North Rhine- 
Westphalia and their 6-year-old daughter tested positive for 
H1N1.  The couple also has a four-year-old daughter that has 
not yet caught the virus.  RKI reports that the couple 
returned to Germany from New York last week but their 
daughters did not accompanied them.  The media reported the 
mother experienced flu like symptoms a few days after her 
return. In the case of the infected child, RKI report this as 
Germany's fifth example of human-to-human infection of the 
virus. 
 
 
First Mass Exposure to Children 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The media reported that the day care center the girl 
attended closed as a precautionary measure to avoid further 
spread of the disease.  34 children from the day care were 
sent home and parents were advised to be on the lookout for 
developing symptoms. Children without symptoms are advised to 
remain at home until June 2 as certainty regarding a potential 
infection can only be determined at the earliest, by May 29. 
 
 
Three Germans Infected - Two while in the US 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) These cases mark the second and third German 
travelers to be infected with the new virus in the US, 
officials from RKI announced today. Nine of the other 
confirmed cases were from people who had recently returned 
from Mexico; five were human-to-human transmissions in 
Germany.
