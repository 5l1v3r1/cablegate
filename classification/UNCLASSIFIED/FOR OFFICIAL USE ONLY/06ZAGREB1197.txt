(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points to MFA (both North 
America and UN departments)on October 3, 2006.  MFA 
working-level officials noted that the Government of Croatia 
will not officially support one candidate over another, but 
unofficially indicated that Croatia is interested in being a 
good ally and will most likely back Guatemala. MFA officials 
also reiterated Croatia's candidacy for a 2008-2009 UNSC seat.
