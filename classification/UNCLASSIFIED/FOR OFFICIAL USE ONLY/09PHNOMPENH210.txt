¶1. (U) The Royal Government of Cambodia is a recipient of U.S. 
foreign assistance funded using FY 09 funds. 
 
¶2. (U) The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) makes publicly 
available the national budget.  Government revenues and expenditures 
are published every month in the Monthly Bulletin, which are 
available for purchase, in both soft and hard copy, from the 
Department of Economic and Public Finance Policy, MEF. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The delayed expenditure reporting cycle makes it difficult 
to guarantee that the publicly-available budget reflects with one 
hundred percent accuracy actual income and expenditures, 
particularly regarding off-budget revenues and unexpected 
expenditures.  Additionally, data on externally financed capital 
expenditures is not yet available at a sufficiently refined level. 
However, the RGC has demonstrated commitment to greater fiscal 
transparency and accountability in the expenditure of donor revenues 
and to the collection and expenditure of government revenues through 
its Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP).  In addition 
to the PFMRP, the RGC continues to cooperate with donors on 
institutional reform and has enacted relevant laws and regulations 
at a steady pace.  With the continued support of the IMF, World 
Bank, ADB, and the general donor community, the RGC has been able to 
create the foundation of a legal framework that governs fiscal 
transparency and accountability.
