REF: A. SECSTATE 75002 KESSLER-MACTAGGART E-MAIL 
     ¶B. 7-17-09 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) IAW reftel, PolEcon chief met with Ontario Power 
Generation (OPG) director of commercial services Mario 
Cornacchia to pass REF B and to ask for a meeting between 
appropriate OPG officials and USG delegation.  Cornacchia was 
familiar with the proposal and broadly supportive, with 
several suggestions and OPG preferences.  Citing a pending 
absence from work (27 July - 10 August) Cornacchia urged us 
to respond to his proposals and concerns before the week ends. 
 
¶2. (SBU) OPG would prefer to transfer its inventory of 
tritium directly to the USG and not be involved in any 
subsequent process to utilize the tritium or its byproducts. 
Cornacchia outlined a three-step proposal that he explained 
would be the most acceptable to OPG. 
      a. USG issues a request for proposal that would permit 
OPG to participate 
      b. OPG responds and begins a dialogue 
      c. OPG/USG come to a mutually-acceptable agreement and 
OPG transfers required material 
 
¶3. (SBU) In response to our request for a meeting and tour of 
the storage facilities, OPG would prefer to have an initial 
meeting consist of "people who can talk business and 
decision-makers," followed by technical discussions between 
the "operations people after a determination has been made 
that a business opportunity exists."  After initially 
resisting a request to include technical experts, Cornnachia 
reluctantly agreed to consider their inclusion, and offered 
an informal tour of the facility. 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to Cornacchia, OPG currently has 18 
kilograms of tritium stored in 704 immobilized tritium 
cylinders at its Darlington, Ontario facility, and annually 
produces two kilograms through its power generation.  Several 
private-sector entities have already expressed interest in 
entering into an agreement with OPG to extract He-3, 
according to Cornaccia.
