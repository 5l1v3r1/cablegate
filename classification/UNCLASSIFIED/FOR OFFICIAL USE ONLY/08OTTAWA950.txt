¶1. (SBU) ESTH Counselor discussed ref A demarche with 
Elizabeth Baldwin-Jones, Deputy Director of the Defence and 
Security Relations Division at the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade, on July 14.  Baldwin-Jones 
said she and her colleagues had been in direct contact with 
EAP/RSP on the matter and confirmed that Canada was on board 
with the basic approach suggested by the United States and 
the basic elements proposed for inclusion in the ARF 
Chairman's statement. 
 
¶2. (SBU) She did note, however, that while greater 
civil-military cooperation in disaster preparation and 
response was of course positive, Canada still regarded as an 
issue defining the proper degree and timing of reliance on 
the military in responding to disasters.
