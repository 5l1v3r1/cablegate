SUBJECT: MOROCCO REQUEST FOR BIOTECH OUTREACH FUNDS 
 
REF: 09 STATE 122732 
 
¶1.  (U) Embassy Rabat's Economic, Agriculture, and 
Public Affairs Sections request Biotech Outreach 
Funds as outlined in the proposal below to support 
efforts to influence scientists and policy makers in 
Morocco regarding the benefits of agricultural 
biotechnology. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Embassy Rabat proposes to hold discussion 
seminars for Moroccan research scientists, 
academics, and policy makers, including advisors 
close to the Royal Palace.  Speakers would include a 
U.S.-based expert in agricultural biotechnology 
policy.  Post proposes to focus these discussions on 
the use of biotech in developing feedstocks for 
biofuels production and optimizing agriculture in 
the face of a changing climate.  These topics 
address areas of significant concern in Morocco, a 
nation that imports 97 percent of its energy needs 
and faces the likelihood of reduced rainfall and 
increased periods of drought as a result of climate 
change. 
 
¶3.  (U) Post requests funds according to the 
instructions in reftel.  The outline of this request 
is as follows: 
 
-- Cost of proposed program:  USD 17,825. 
(Airfare: USD 6,000, Lodging plus M and IE: USD 
2,275, honorarium: USD 800, Seminar logistics costs: 
USD 1,650, Interpretation and equipment rental: USD 
7,100) 
 
-- Target audiences:  Research scientists at 
National Institute for Agronomic Research (INRA), 
university academics, and members of the Royal 
Institute for Strategic Studies (IRES). 
 
-- Specific ag-biotech issues to be addressed: 
Utility and potential of agricultural biotechnology 
to optimize biofuels feedstock and adapt crops to 
changes in climate. 
 
-- How the project would help meet USG policy 
objectives:  This program would allow scientists and 
policy advisors the opportunity to discuss 
agricultural biotechnology with U.S. experts in the 
field, permitting a better understanding of the 
technologies and benefits and risks.  Currently, 
agricultural biotechnology is prohibited in food 
crops in Morocco due to its trade relations with 
Europe, and the Embassy judges it counterproductive 
to press for immediate acceptance of ag-biotech in 
food crops.  However, Morocco is very concerned 
about developing alternative sources of energy to 
reduce its import dependence, and also is very 
concerned about the likelihood of drier climate 
affecting its agriculture.  These topics would 
provide an opportunity to reduce opposition to ag- 
biotech in Morocco among scientists, policy 
advisors, and other opinion leaders. 
 
-- Proposed length of program:  3 days of one-day 
seminars at different locations (INRA, IRES, and 
universities). 
 
-- Arranging speakers:  Post requests the assistance 
of the IIP Speaker Program in arranging for a 
speaker. 
 
-- Post responsible officer:  Jai L. Nair, Economic 
Officer (SBU email: NairJL@state.gov; phone: 212- 
537-76-22-65 extension 2136).
