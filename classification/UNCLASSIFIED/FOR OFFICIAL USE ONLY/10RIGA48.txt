(SBU) We delivered reftel demarche to Inese Freimane-Deksne, head of 
the Human Rights Section of the MFA International Organizations 
Department, on January 27.  Freimane-Deksne indicated that Latvia is 
supportive of the U.S. position.  However, they are unlikely to 
submit recommendations of their own in Geneva, in part due to 
resource constraints.  She said they would consider our request, and 
noted that Latvia has been active on pressing Iranian human rights 
issues within its capacity, including participation in EU efforts 
and bilateral demarches at the Political Director level.
