STIR UP SEWAGE PROBLEMS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  USAID Gaza-based staff report that the 
IDF incursions in Gaza are directly impacting the treatment 
and handling of sewage in Gaza, portending negative 
environmental and health-related consequences.  End Summary. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) IDF operations in northern Gaza continue to prevent 
maintenance workers from accessing the Beit Lahiya and Beit 
Hanoun sewage "lakes," according to USAID staff.  (Note: 
Beit Lahiya lake covers 30 hectares (300,000 square meters) 
and contains over 2 million cubic meters of sewage.  End 
Note.)  The maintenance crews also have not been able to 
shore up the levies on a regular basis, as a result of which 
sewage could flow into the residential areas below them.  A 
breach of the levies could also cause untreated sewage to 
flow into the Mediterranean.  According to USAID staff, this 
sewage could reach the Ashkelon Desalination plant intake 
pipe 8km north of Gaza. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In central Gaza, IDF shelling caused damage to two 
pipelines in Nuseirat.  As a consequence, the pipelines were 
rerouted to stream sewage directly into the Mediterranean. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) USAID staff said that the IDF bombing of the power 
plant transformers in Gaza in late June and the ensuing 
electricity and fuel shortages have limited the operations of 
wastewater treatment plants in Gaza.  The Coastal 
Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU) issued a report July 4 
warning that wastewater could pollute the groundwater aquifer 
if treatment plants remain inoperable.  The CMWU also 
indicated that 33 sewage pump stations throughout Gaza have 
had to restrict their operations because of the reduced 
electricity supply.  The report highlighted that this sewage 
could also overflow into the low-land residential areas of 
Gaza.
