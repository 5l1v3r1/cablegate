SUBJECT: TANZANIA SENDING TEAM OF 50 OBSERVERS TO ZIMBABWE 
FOR RUNOFF ELECTION 
 
¶1. (SBU) Tanzania's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and 
International Cooperation, Ambassador Seif Ali Idd, confirmed 
to PolCouns June 13 that the Government of Tanzania (GOT) had 
sent 25 observers to Zimbabwe on June 12 to participate in 
the SADC observer mission for the upcoming runoff elections 
in Zimbabwe.  In addition, another 25 Tanzanians were 
scheduled to leave for Harare on June 14.  PolCouns inquired 
whether Tanzania had considered sending even a greater number 
of election monitors in an effort to deter the continuing 
violence against the MDC opposition party members.  Idd 
replied that the GOT's strategy continued to be to work 
quietly to convince other SADC member countries to also send 
up to 50 observers. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Idd agreed that for this next round of 
elections, SADC's objective must be to ensure that all areas 
in Zimbabwe, including key rural regions, would be under 
observation during the run-up to the June 27 polls and on 
election day itself.  "Our goal is to send to Zimbabwe at 
least 500 observers from SADC, and ideally, the same number 
from other African Union (AU) members that are not part of 
SADC."  Idd gave assurances that President Kikwete, in his 
role as the AU Chair, would continue to press AU member 
states to send as many election monitors as possible to join 
the observation teams well in advance of June 27th.
