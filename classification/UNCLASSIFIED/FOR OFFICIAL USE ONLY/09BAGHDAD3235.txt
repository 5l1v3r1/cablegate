¶1. (SBU) Summary: Post's Emergency Assistance Coordination 
Team (EACT) continues to monitor damage assessments and 
requests for USG assistance following the December 8 
bombings. While we have received small requests for 
assistance, GOI ministries and entities have addressed 
immediE56>jBGRQ=IQQQQcontainers to 
the HJC, and is working to identify additional storage 
options. 
 
¶4.  (U) The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance 
(USAID/OFDA) reported that the International Organization for 
Migration (IOM) provided blankets, carpets, kerosene heaters, 
mattresses, plastic sheeting, and other non-food relief items 
to families in Dora, Al-Qahira, Al-Jemhori and Al-Rasheed 
districts. The International Medical Corps (IMC) provided 
bandages, intravenous kits, syringes and wheelchairs to 
Al-Kindi and Medical City hospitals. 
 
¶5.  (U) The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) has conducted an assessment of damaged housing and is 
considering shelter reconstruction for some families who have 
had serious damage to their homes. On December 15, UNHCR 
distributed 946 non-food item kits to victims of the blasts, 
including blankets, kitchen kits, jerry cans, and plastic 
sheeting.  The International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC) has dispatched one large surgical trauma kit and will 
provide two additional kits. ICRC officials told us they are 
impressed with how well Iraqi hospital partners have managed 
materials that ICRC previously provided.  They also noted 
that hospital and Ministry of Health officials have 
demonstrated considerable self sufficiency in the wake of the 
bombings.
