SUBJECT: CUBA QUERIES DELAY IN VISA ISSUANCE FOR FORMER 
HOST COUNTRY COMMITTEE REPRESENTATIVE 
 
REF: USUN NEW YORK 00194 
 
 ¶1. (SBU/NOFORN) Action request - USUN seeks Department's 
guidance in replying to the Cuban Mission regarding the delay 
in visa issuance to diplomat and former Cuban represenative 
on the UN Committee on Relations with the Host Country--a/k/a 
the Host Country Committee), Juana Elena Ramos Rodriguez (6 
May 1956, Cuba). Cuba MUN alleges that Cuba's MFA requested a 
visa from USINT Havana through a note verbale (No. 058) dated 
Janaury 24, 2008 that was presented to USINT Havana on 
January 29. The visa was requested so that Mrs Ramos could 
attend two official UN meetings at UN HQ in NYC: 1) The Ad 
Hoc Committee established by UN GA Resolution 51/210 meeting 
February 25-26 and again on March 6; and 2) the Session of 
the Special Committee on the UN Charter to be held Feb 27 - 
March 7. According to CCD records, the SAO clearance for the 
applicant was issued only on Febrary 27, thus making it 
impossible for the diplomat to attend the first two days of 
the first official UN meeting above. 
¶2. (SBU/NOFORN) Comment: When USUN Host Country asked the 
current Cuban representative on the Host Country Committee 
why she had waited until late Friday afternoon on February 22 
to contact USUN regarding the lack of visa issuance, she 
replied that Cuba had observed that the U.S. often does not 
issue visas for Cuban officials coming to the UN until the 
last possible moment, and Cuba was hoping to have the visa 
issued by Friday, February 22. Although Cuba has thus far 
complained only orally and we have not received a formal 
diplomatic note protesting the delay in visa issuance, we 
fully expect the Cubans to raise this case at the next Host 
Country Committee meeting, probably in rebutting USUN after 
Cuba raises its formal protest concerning the delay in visa 
issuance to Cuban governmental expert Jose Rufino Menendez 
Hernandez (reftel). End comment.
