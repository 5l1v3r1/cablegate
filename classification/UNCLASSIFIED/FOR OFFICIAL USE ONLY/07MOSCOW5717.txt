--------------- 
"DONE FOR 2008" 
--------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Confirming press reports, Gazprom International 
Affairs Director Ivan Zolotov told us December 5th that a 
deal had been concluded with Ukrainian Minister of Energy 
Yuriy Boyko the previous day on the 2008 gas price to Ukraine 
and transit fees to and through Ukraine.  Zolotov said 
negotiations are now "done for 2008."  The agreement calls 
for Ukraine to pay $179.50 per thousand cubic meters (mcm), 
up from the current $130.  Ukraine will raise transit fees on 
Russian gas to Europe from $1.60 to $1.70 per mcm per hundred 
kilometers, and pay Gazprom $1.70 per mcm per hundred km for 
transit from Turkmenistan for the gas destined to Ukraine. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Zolotov claimed the Ukrainians "were happy" with the 
deal, given Gazprom's "compromise" on the transit tariff 
increase.  He said the previous agreement leading to "market 
prices" by 2011 still stands and reiterated that "Ukraine is 
still getting a good deal" compared to the rest of Europe, 
which is expected to pay over $300 per mcm in 2008.  When we 
asked Ukrainian Embassy first secretary Yaroslav Dubovich if 
they were happy with the deal, he replied, "...happy? We're 
happy that the negotiations are over."  He also confirmed 
that the deal has been finalized.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Given that Gazprom basically sells to Ukraine the 
gas it buys from Turkmenistan, and that Turkmenistan raised 
its price to $150 per mcm for the second half of 2008 
(reftels), a rise above the previously expected $160 per mcm 
price for Ukraine was inevitable.  There was some anxiety 
last week as to whether this year's negotiations, somewhat 
derailed by the Turkmen price increase, would go down to the 
wire.  But both sides seem to have shown some flexibility, 
and this appears to be the end, for now, of the gas price 
saga between Russia and Ukraine.  It is welcome news and 
should be well-received by European gas consumers.
