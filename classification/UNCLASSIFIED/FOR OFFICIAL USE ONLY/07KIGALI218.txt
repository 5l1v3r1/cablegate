¶1. (SBU)  The Chinese and Rwandan governments conduct their 
long-standing and productive relations on a number of levels. 
 Last year the Chinese Minister of Cooperation and a senior 
Communist party official visited Kigali in August, under the 
aegis of the Fifth Rwanda-China Joint Committee on Economic, 
Technical and Trade Cooperation.  The Chinese agreed to 
finance a new building for the Foreign Ministry, and to 
consider the construction of a new football stadium, a 
women's center, and a Confucius Institute.  A 20 person 
Chinese business delegation came a week later.  Later in the 
year, President Kagame attended the Sino-Africa Summit, and 
met with President Hu Jintao. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) China has long-term agricultural development 
programs in Rwanda, including a pilot high-yield rice 
program.  It has built the majority of Rwanda's national 
roads. Its Chancery is under-going a significant expansion 
and refurbishment program, just down the road from the U.S. 
Embassy.  The Chinese are continuing discussions with the GOR 
on the feasibility of a rail line from neighboring Tanzania. 
It has offered soft loans for a number of development 
projects.
