SUBJECT: KASHIN PROTESTS, BUT NOT TO EMBASSY OR MFA 
 
¶1. (SBU) Aleksandr Kashin, who was paralyzed from the chest 
down as a result of a 1998 traffic accident involving then 
Consul General in Vladivostok Douglas Kent, traveled to 
Moscow on March 3 where he reportedly continues a hunger 
strike, apparently initiated to draw attention to his plight 
and to indicate his frustration with what he sees as a lack 
of response from the USG.  According to press reports, Kashin 
took up residence at the Hotel "Zvezda" accompanied by a 
nurse in order to meet with his US-based lawyer, the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, and the Russian media.  As of March 6, he 
has not/not contacted the Embassy, nor has he been in touch 
with the MFA. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) While reportedly rejecting a U.S. offer of a USD 
100,000 humanitarian payment (as reported by the press, but 
not officially communicated to the USG by Kashin or his 
lawyer), Kashin has sought to re-kindle public interest in 
his case.  He began a hunger strike on February 18 and 
claimed that he is living only on water, according to press 
reports.  (Our consulate in Vladivostok reports that local 
press stories suggest he suspended his strike while 
recuperating in a local hospital.)  According to the 
newspaper Pravda, Kashin complains that he has not had a 
response to his letters to President Bush, Secretary Rice or 
Assistant Secretary Fried and claimed he would continue his 
fast "until he dies or until his demands are met" -- he 
continues to seek a payment of $10 million in "moral damages." 
 
¶3. (SBU) A Vladivostok lawyer told the Russian press that 
Kashin may have grounds to appeal to the GOR for assistance, 
since the MFA accredited Kent as a foreign diplomat and is 
therefore responsible for Kent's actions while in Russia. 
Officials at the MFA's North America Department on March 4 
were unaware of any legal plans by Kashin to seek GOR 
financial support.  In a separate conversation on February 
29, MFA North America Director Igor Neverov acknowledged the 
difficult situation that Kashin's hunger strike posed for the 
U.S. and welcomed efforts to find a "humanitarian package" 
for Kashin.  Neverov noted the affair is problematic for the 
GOR, since a Russian citizen had been crippled by an American 
diplomat, with no apparent legal relief on the part of the 
U.S.  The MFA's preference is to keep this issue low-key, but 
Neverov recognized that the prospect of Kashin re-engaging 
with the national press may preclude this.
