Summary 
 
-------------- 
 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Al-Shabaab and Hisbul Islam have increased their attacks 
against TFG and AMISOM positions in Mogadishu.  In an apparent 
effort to pre-empt the TFG's long-planned Mogadishu offensive, on 
February 12 and 13 al-Shabaab launched attacks from northern 
Mogadishu neighborhoods and on February 15, claimed responsibility 
for an assassination attempt against Minister of State for Defense 
Yusuf Mohamed Siyad "Inde Adde."  Al-Shabaab mortar attacks and the 
TFG/AMISOM response caused civilian casualties but have failed to 
yield any new areas of control for either the TFG or al-Shabaab. 
UNHCR reports that since February 1 at least 13,000 Mogadishu 
citizens have fled the fighting.  In addition to dozens of 
combatant casualties on both sides, the UN reports that at least 80 
civilians were killed in the first two weeks of February.  As the 
TFG prepares for its offensive against al-Shabaab in Mogadishu, it 
is maintaining key positions with newly trained recruits while the 
city's residents prepare for the worst.    End Summary. 
 
 
 
Violent Clashes Increase in Mogadishu 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) In recent weeks, al-Shabaab and Hisbul Islam have 
increased the frequency and intensity of violent attacks against 
TFG and AMISOM positions in Mogadishu.  Beginning February 10, 
al-Shabaab has repeatedly attacked TFG and AMISOM troops with small 
arms and mortar fire, provoking the TFG and AMISOM to respond in 
kind.  Mortar rounds launched by both sides have killed an 
estimated two dozen civilians and wounded many more in recent days. 
Most believe that these skirmishes are in response to February 6 
TFG troop movements (reftel), and are extremists' attempt to 
disrupt a promised TFG/AMISOM offensive in Mogadishu.  Our contacts 
report that al-Shabaab is building its arsenal and concentrating 
its fighters in several strategic areas in and around the city. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Sources have told us the TFG troop movement has prompted 
al-Shabaab to reinforce from their strongholds in the southern 
parts of Mogadishu to the northern neighborhoods, to directly 
engage recently repositioned TFG troops.  During the skirmishes, 
the TFG troops reportedly performed better than in the past, 
drawing on recent training in Djibouti and with AMISOM trainers at 
the TFG's Jazeera camp, according to our contacts.  Continuing 
their attacks on the airwaves, Hisbul Islam and al-Shabaab leaders 
publicly appealed to Mogadishu's residents for support against the 
TFG and AMISOM in what they termed a "religious obligation."  The 
TFG responded to these appeals, effectively using Radio Mogadishu 
to continue their own information campaign against these groups. 
 
 
 
Assassination Attempt Targets State Minister of Defense 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------------- 
----------------- 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Al-Shabaab has continued its attacks against high-level 
TFG officials.  On February 15, State Minister for Defense Yusuf 
Mohamed Siyad "Indha Adde" narrowly escaped at least one suicide 
car bomb attack against his convoy in Mogadishu.  Reports still 
vary, but as many as eight civilians and two TFG troops may have 
been killed.  Addressing the press immediately following the 
attack, the Minister of State said that al-Shabaab would not deter 
him from his mission to "restore law and order."  He told 
journalists two car bombs were used against him on February 15.   A 
 
NAIROBI 00000346  002 OF 002 
 
 
minibus coincidentally obstructed the first car bomb as the bomber 
sped toward the minister's convoy.  The minister told the press 
that he saw a second oncoming car and in the confusion following 
the first explosion, ran into a nearby hotel.  Inde Adde said that 
moments later, this second car also exploded. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The bomb or bombs caused extensive property damage, 
including to the offices of USAID implementing partner Education 
Development Center (EDC), which provides education programs via 
radio and a youth livelihood program in Mogadishu.  No EDC staff 
were injured.  EDC reported by email, "The explosion created an 
atmosphere of terror and panic in the area with no public movement 
as government forces arrived at the scene and sealed off the road." 
 
 
 
 
Civilian Displacement Continues 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Mogadishu's residents have begun to flee in the face of 
increasingly violent skirmishes between government troops and 
extremists.  UNHCR reported that since February 1, at least 13,000 
internally displaced persons (IDPs) have moved into safer 
neighborhoods within the capital and into the Afgoye road corridor, 
joining over 365,000 people displaced by earlier fighting.  On 
February 15, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Mark Bowden 
expressed "grave concern" over high civilian casualties and 
population displacement.  According to Bowden, fighting in 
Mogadishu in the first two weeks of February killed an estimated 80 
civilians.  UNHCR reports that since May 2009, when armed 
extremists launched their first offensive against President 
Sharif's administration, more than 250,000 persons have been forced 
to flee Mogadishu. 
 
 
 
Comment 
 
-------------- 
 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) We will continue to monitor the increase in fighting, and 
will stress to the TFG and AMISOM the need to avoid civilian 
casualties.  In particular, we will continue to object strongly to 
TFG and AMISOM use of mortar fire in populated areas.  USAID is 
examining the growth of IDPs and investigating NGO partners' 
reports al-Shabaab is blocking food assistance to IDPs in the 
Afgoye corridor.
