¶1. (SBU) Embassy Khartoum welcomes and grants country clearance for 
S/CRS Eythan Sontag to travel to Khartoum to assist post from 
January 27 to April, 2007. 
 
¶2. (SBU) U.S. citizens are reminded that Sudanese visas are now 
required for travel to all parts of Sudan.  The Sudanese Government 
has informed us that it no longer recognizes SPLM clearances (see 
paragraph 7 for details.)

on arrival. 
 
¶5. (U) EXCHANGE RATE: Current exchange rate at post is 200 Sudanese 
Dinars to one USD. 
 
¶6. (U) PASSPORT/VISA: 
 
¶A.  U.S. Citizens are reminded that Sudanese visas are now required 
for travel to all parts of Sudan.  It is the traveler's 
responsibility to obtain a Sudanese visa prior to arrival in 
Khartoum.  Please note that the Government of Sudan does not/not 
issue airport visas and currently does not permit entry of a 
traveler whose passport bears an Israeli stamp. 
 
¶B.  IF TRAVELING FROM THE UNITED STATES AND/OR A U.S. MISSION 
ABROAD:  The Sudanese Government has a restrictive policy in regards 
to visa issuances to official American travelers.  Official 
Americans should not begin their travel to Sudan without having 
obtained a Sudanese visa or having received notice that a visa has 
been authorized for issuance in another city.  Recently the Sudanese 
Government has advised that official American travelers coming from 
Washington, DC, no longer need post's assistance in preparing 
diplomatic notes for visa issuance; travelers may apply directly to 
the Sudanese Embassy in Washington.  For visa issuance from other 
Sudanese Embassies, official American travelers may have to contact 
the American Embassy in Khartoum for assistance. 
 
¶7. (U) MEDICAL CLEARANCE: 
 
¶A.  All employees, including WAEs and civil service employees who 
are in TDY status for more than 60 days (cumulatively) in a calendar 
year, are required to have an up-to-date medical clearance from the 
Department of State Office of Medical Services (M/MED) in order to 
receive full State Department medical benefits from an Embassy 
Medical Unit, to include Embassy Khartoum Medical Unit. 
 
¶B.  MEDICAL CLEARANCE FOR PSC AND NON-PSC:  As per State cable 
201464, all contract workers (PSC and non-PSC, to include 
institutional contractors and grantees) must have a medical 
clearance issued from M/MED before arrival at post.  A copy of this 
clearance is required by the Medical Unit on arrival at post before 
any Embassy Khartoum Medical Unit services can be provided. 
 
¶C.  IMMUNIZATIONS (DIRECT HIRE, WAE, TDYERS, PSC, AND NON-PSC): 
Please ensure that you complete all immunizations recommended by 
M/MED before arrival at post.  Yellow fever and polio (IPV) are 
required at least 10 days before departure.  Malaria prophylaxis is 
required for post and should commence 1 or 2 weeks before departure. 
 Please ensure enough prophylaxis is issued to cover your TDY period 
at post.  Upon arrival, travelers should visit the Medical Unit to 
register and receive further health information.  Travelers' 
diarrhea is a common problem in Sudan.  Only bottled water or 
distilled water should be used for drinking (this includes ice). 
Eat foods that are well cooked.  Avoid fruits without peels, raw 
vegetables, salads, and local dairy products, which might not be 
pasteurized.  At least 8-10 glasses of water or flu)ds areQrecmlEnef`to evgid duhdsat)ol  A$topyg!| jsea4 pQpelnEnt enlQ
