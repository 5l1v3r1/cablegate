¶1. (SBU) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Johanna 
Suurpaa, Director of the Finnish MFA's Unit for Human Rights 
Policy Oct. 11.  Finland has actively pressed within the EU 
for strengthened sanctions and has called for the EU to seek 
new sectors in which sanctions might appropriately be 
applied, Suurpaa said.  She noted, for example, that the ruby 
trade out of Burma is particularly problematic and that 
Finland may join other EU countries in pressing for concerted 
sanctions on gem stone exports that benefit the regime. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Suurpaa said that Finland maintains no significant 
bilateral aid programs in Burma.
