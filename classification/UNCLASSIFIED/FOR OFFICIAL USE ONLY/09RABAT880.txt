SUBJECT: MOROCCO SEEKS BROADER LEGAL COOPERATION WITH U.S. 
 
REF: RABAT 0545 
 
(SBU) Referencing King Mohammed VI's August 21 speech calling 
for the reform of Morocco's judicial system, Ministry of 
Justice Secretary General Mohammed Lididi told PolCouns and 
PolOff on October 23 that Morocco would welcome broader 
bilateral cooperation in this area.  "We want to expand and 
reinforce our legal cooperation with you," Lididi explained, 
adding, "We are focused on getting results."  In particular, 
he underscored Morocco's desire to have an extradition treaty 
with the U.S., as well as an agreement concerning the 
repatriation of prisoners.  (NOTE:  Morocco and the U.S. 
currently have a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which 
governs the exchange of evidence, but do not have an 
extradition treaty or other similar legal exchange 
agreements.  END NOTE.)
