GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING CLIMATE 
CHANGE 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 116939 
     ¶B. WELLINGTON 297 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  During the past five years, as the GNZ 
has ramped up its involvement in Global Climate Change (GCC) 
issues under the leadership of Helen Clark, there have been 
no significant structural changes within the government. 
Instead, the GNZ has absorbed GCC responsibilites within the 
existing governmental framework, albeit with the addition of 
approximately 70 additional staffers in various ministries. 
To date, the existing Climate Change Ambassador, Adrian 
Macey, has not changed with election of the new government 
under John Key.  However, Key recently named Dr. Nick Smith 
as both the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for 
Climate Change.  End summary. 
 
No Structural Changes in Government from GCC Efforts 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2.  (U) In response to action request (Ref A), no significant 
organizational changes have occurred within the GNZ during 
the last 12-18 months as the government works to address 
global climate change (GCC).  In September 2008, the New 
Zealand parliament adopted a comprehensive and ambitious cap 
and trade program to reduce the country's greenhouse gas 
emissions (the Emissions Trading Scheme or "ETS" - see Ref 
B).  However, that initiative did not result in any 
significant organizational changes within government.  The 
GNZ uses a cross sector, "whole-of-government" approach to 
deal with GCC issues, with responsibilities being split among 
several ministries: 
 
- ETS: Ministry for the Environment (MfE)(sic) 
- Emissions registry (for ETS): Ministry of Economic 
Development (MED) 
- Energy strategy: MED 
- Energy efficiency and conservation strategy: Energy 
Efficiency and Conservation Authority 
- Sustainable land management and climate change strategy: 
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) 
- Transport strategy: Ministry of Transport (MOT) 
- Waste strategy: MfE 
- GCC adaptation, public awareness and education: MfE 
 
Though There is a New GCC Czar... 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) As a result of previous climate change policies 
adopted in 2002 and 2005, the GNZ had already appointed a 
Minister for Climate Change (within MfE) and a Climate Change 
Ambassador (within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade).  The new Minister for Climate Change, appointed in 
November by PM John Key, is Dr. Nick Smith, who also holds 
the position of Minister for the Environment.  The existing 
Climate Change Ambassador is Adrian Macey, and there has been 
no indication from the Key government to date that Macey will 
be replaced. 
 
And 70-plus GCC-related Personnel 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Over the last five years, as the GNZ gradually 
ramped up its involvement in GCC issues under the Helen Clark 
regime, staffing for those efforts increased significantly. 
According to Phil Guernsey, who serves as the environmental 
staffer for Minister Smith, GCC-related positions within the 
GNZ have increased during that period by approximately 70 
positions: MfE has added approximately 30 personnel; MAF has 
added another 30 or so; MED, approximately 10; and MOT and 
Ministry of Treasury,  one or two each.  These positions 
represent a sizable addition to the GNZ budget and as a 
result, according to Guernsey, the Key government is closely 
scrutinizing the budget impact of that personnel growth (as 
well as non-GCC-related personnel expansion throughout 
government over the last several years). 
 
Bio Note on Dr. Nick Smith 
-------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) Bio note: Dr. Nick Smith, age 43, is the 
second-youngest member of the National Party's front bench. 
His portfolio includes environment, climate change, and the 
ACC (the GNZ-owned health and disability insuror). He has a 
PhD in civil engineering and entered parliament at the age of 
¶24. End note.
