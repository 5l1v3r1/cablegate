¶1. (SBU) Summary: Contrary to earlier indications (Ref B), 
the GOZ has not yet lifted its general ban on the export of 
poultry and poultry products following the discovery of type 
H5N2 avian influenza (AI) in Zimbabwe late last year.  The 
GOZ is investigating the phyto-sanitary capabilities of 
export-focused poultry farms and certifying them individually 
to export.  Thus far three farms have met the criteria and 
were permitted limited exports. The Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) has provided funding to test commercial 
poultry flocks throughout the country.  The GOZ is seeking 
further funding to test chickens raised in communal areas. 
Partly as a result of the export ban, chickens flooded the 
market this holiday season, depressing prices to below the 
cost of production. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Director of Veterinary Services Dr. Stuart 
Hargreaves told EmbOff on January 10 that his office had 
decided not to lift the export ban on poultry and poultry 
products as a precaution against the spread of the non-lethal 
H5N2 AI strain discovered in Zimbabwe late last year 
(reftel).  He said the GOZ is proceeding with individual 
certification of the phyto-sanitary abilities and expertise 
of poultry farms in the export business.  As they meet the 
appropriate benchmarks, they will be certified to export. 
Hargreaves said three farms had thus far met the criteria and 
were free to export day-old chicks.  He also stated that 
BirdLife Zimbabwe had identified wetland areas, including 
around Harare, for further testing and monitoring.  According 
to Hargreaves, the AI strain had been carried to Africa by 
migratory birds. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Zimbabwe has received US$ 33,000 from the FAO to 
test commercial poultry flocks throughout the country.  The 
GOZ is seeking further funding to test chickens raised in 
residential and communal areas and to hire a consultant to 
review protocols in place and analyze data. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Zimbabwe Poultry Association President Peter 
Drummond told PolOff on January 11 that the discovery of H5N2 
had dashed the plans of Zimbabwe's major exporters to export 
a significant quantity of poultry to Namibia.  The exporters 
had been forced to dump the meat on the local market during 
the holiday season, thus depressing prices below the cost of 
production.  Drummond noted that Zimbabwe,s cost of 
production was USD 2.00/kg and the poultry had been sold at 
USD1.50/kg.  Nonetheless, he maintained that the industry 
supported Hargreaves, approach, as it would assure the 
foreign market of the safety of Zimbabwean poultry. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  Hargreaves, cautionary approach is a 
positive step towards containing the spread of AI, including 
non-lethal strais.  However, Zimbabwe,s economic meltdown 
has taen its toll on the country,s health care system an 
the GOZ will require international assistance i containing 
any AI outbreak.
