¶1.  (U) Sensitive but Unclassified - not for internet 
distribution. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The MFA wants the French Parliament to approve NATO 
membership for Croatia and Albania before the April 2009 NATO 
summit in Strasbourg-Kehl, according to DAS-equivalent for 
the Balkans, Thierry Guichoux, who discussed ratification 
with Poloff on September 19.  Guichoux noted parliament 
determines the calendar for ratification.  He added that the 
MFA had even encouraged the Croatian and Albanian governments 
to deliver a demarche directly to the French parliament to 
help speed the process.  French parliamentary contacts told 
us that while no date has yet been set for the debate and 
vote on the latest round of NATO enlargement, the parliament 
is aware that it is a GOF priority for action before the 
April NATO summit.  (Comment: The French President's party 
controls majorities in both houses of French parliament; 
therefore we do not anticipate difficulties in the 
ratification process which we expect to occur before  April 
2009).
