DESPITE MISGIVINGS 
 
REF: RABAT 671 
 
¶1.  (SBU) MFA Director of UN and International Affairs Nasser 
Bourita told Polcouns May 10 that the May 15 visit of the 
Office of the High Commission for Human Rights (OHCHR) was 
going forward, and the program had been prepared.  The 
delegation, which would not include Louise Arbour, would 
arrive in Rabat May 15 for a meeting with MFA Secretary 
General Omar Hilale.  They would proceed from Rabat to 
Laayoune (Western Sahara), where they would spend the bulk of 
their time. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Bourita said the GOM still had concerns about the 
delegation's stop in Algeria, which he understood was only 
half a day and even then lacked a "precise program." 
Reiterating reftel concerns, Bourita said this was not enough 
time to take up human rights issues with the GOA.  The GOM 
was preparing a dossier on violations of human rights that 
took place on Algerian territory, and the commission needs 
time to investigate the Moroccan claims, he insisted.  All in 
all, the commission's visit was "very imbalanced, and it is a 
bad start."  Morocco, nevertheless, did not wish a to make "a 
bid deal" out of it, but he hoped that countries like the US 
that support the mission would work to ensure that Morocco's 
concerns were taken seriously and Morocco's charges were 
properly addressed.
