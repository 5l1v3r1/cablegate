SUBJECT:  UNDSS AUGUST 3 SECURITY UPDATE FOR NORTH DARFUR; MORE 
SLM/A FRACTURING 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  UNDSS continues to describe the security 
situation in North Darfur as unstable and volatile.  Shifting 
positions and allegiances among the rebel movements are clouding the 
political and security picture on the ground, increasing the threat 
level for NGOs.  END SUMMARY.

UNDSS List of Recent Security Events 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) In its August 3 security meeting, UNDSS outlined several 
recent security incidents, including: 
 
-- July 27:  An alleged "poisoning" incident of water in the Garsila 
IDP camp; 
 
-- July 28:  An OXFAM driver was killed in Hilelat after being 
caught up in fighting there (see septel); 
 
-- July 31:  A Development Alternatives International (a USAID 
implementing partner) vehicle was carjacked in Abu Shouk IDP camp. 
The driver was forced at gunpoint to drive the vehicle away from the 
camp; the perpetrators, suspected by UNDSS to be NRF, deposited the 
DAI employees outside of Abu Shouk and took off with the vehicle; 
and 
 
-- July 31:  UNDSS confirmed that Sudanese Armed Forces Antonov 
bombers dropped an unspecified amount of ordnance on the village of 
Bobai; there were no human casualties, though six animals were 
killed.  Unexploded ordnance remains in the vicinity of the 
village.

UNDSS Warns of SAF Build-up, Potential for More Clashes 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) UNDSS also advised that NGOs should refrain from operating 
in the Kulkul-Mellit-El Fasher triangle due to the build-up of GNU 
forces in the area and the potential for continued clashes in the 
area around Kulkul.  UN security further observed that possible 
clashes between GNU troops and rebel factions near Muzbat and 
Birmaza dictated that these areas also be labeled as "no go" for 
NGOs.  Action Contre La Faim (ACF) offered that security around 
Shangil Tobaya has declined to the point that NGOs can only function 
there during daylight hours; UNDSS is monitoring the situation. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
SLM Shafi Breakaway Group Undecided on DPA, NRF 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4. (SBU) UNDSS also provided brief comments on the recent fracture 
within SLA-Abdel Wahid.  He confirmed the creation of a new faction, 
led by Ahmed Abdel Shafi, but noted that four of Abdel Wahid's 
staunchest field commanders have not broken away with the new group. 
 On the margins, UNDSS stated that the new faction led by Shafi is 
due to meet in Asmara today to determine its stance vis-a-vis the 
DPA and National Redemption Front (NRF).  Based on his conversation 
with Shafi, UNDSS opined that the rebel leader "is leaning toward 
support for the DPA."  He expects that once a decision is taken, 
Shafi will return to Darfur, most likely within the next three to 
five days.  ARC officer also briefly discussed potential GNU courses 
of action around Kulkul.  UNDSS agreed that, given the build-up of 
GNU forces in the area and heightened aerial (Antonov and helicopter 
gunship) reconnaissance, renewed fighting in the next few days is 
probable.

Comment

¶5. (SBU) The implications of the new split within the SLA are still 
being sorted out.  The military balance of power - whether Abdel 
Wahid's group or the new faction is stronger - is also unclear. 
News of the recent SLA fracture is still fresh and popular support 
for one group or the other remains undefined.  A number of Fur 
leaders with whom ARC officer met indicated that they did not have a 
particularly strong inclination toward supporting Shafi, though they 
also noted that some Fur feel frustrated that Abdel Wahid has "sold 
them out" by focusing on his own quest for power rather than the 
plight of his tribe.  END COMMENT.
