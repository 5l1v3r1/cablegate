UNSC CONSULTATIONS 
 
1.(U) This is an action request. USUN should draw from the 
points in para 2 during the closed consultations on the 
United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) in the 
Security Council on February 16. 
 
Â¶2. (SBU) Begin Points: 
 
--I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his report 
and UNAMI for its steadfast commitment to support the Iraqi 
people towards a more peaceful and prosperous future. 
 
--UNAMI plays an integral role in addressing issues essential 
to the long-term peace, security, and prosperity of Iraq. 
The United States would like to recognize the work of SRSG Ad 
Melkert and his staff, and welcome Deputy Special 
Representative's Christine McNab and Jerzy Sturatowicz to 
UNAMI.  We are proud to offer our continued full support for 
UNAMI,s mandate. 
--In nineteen days the Iraqi people will go to the polls to 
exercise their right to vote.  By holding legitimate, 
inclusive and transparent national parliamentary elections on 
March 7, Iraq will take another step forward as a sovereign 
democracy. 
--The United States would like to highlight UNAMI's efforts 
to support Iraqi national parliamentary elections, 
particularly its critical role to support Iraq's Council of 
Representatives in securing a national election law, provide 
technical assistance and advice to Iraq,s Independent High 
Electoral Commission (IHEC), train and organize 
out-of-country voting delegations and secure election 
observers. 
 
--We note our appreciation to multilateral institutions such 
as the European Union and the Arab League, and UN member 
states such as Japan, Korea, Turkey, Australia, and Germany 
who have already agreed to send election observers.  We also 
welcome UNAMI's commitment to send 14 observer teams.  The 
United States will send representatives to serve as election 
observers in all provinces.  The international community's 
efforts will complement the thousands of trained Iraqi 
election observers, monitoring networks, and watchdog groups 
to serve as the first line of defense against potential 
electoral fraud. 
 
--We would also like to highlight UNAMI's important role in 
addressing Iraq,s disputed internal boundaries, 
particularly, UNAMI's facilitated High Level Task Force.  The 
U.S. encourages continued engagement to increase dialogue and 
foster cooperation towards a just and fair solution ) a key 
step in creating stability for all of Iraq. 
 
--UNAMI's work to facilitate the sustainable and voluntary 
return and reintegration of Iraqi refugees and internally 
displaced persons is also critical to the long-term stability 
of Iraq. With some 221,000 returns in 2008 and 205,000 
returns in 2009, the U.S. strongly supports UNAMI's continued 
work and welcomes additional efforts on this issue by the 
Government of Iraq. 
 
--The United States is proud to note UNAMI,s expanding 
footprint in Iraq and its outstanding record of 
accomplishment to date.  We deeply appreciate Special 
Representative Melkert's hard work and dedication on behalf 
of the Iraqi people.  We look forward to your continued 
success. 
 
--Thank you.
