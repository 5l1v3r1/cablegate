SUBJECT: NEW GOP POINT MAN ON PTPA GOES TO WASHINGTON 
 
REF: LIMA 0129 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  David Lemor, the GOP's de facto point man 
on the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) told us 
January 19 that the GOP would now take a more internally 
coordinated and energetic approach in pushing for U.S. 
Congressional approval of the agreement.  He travels to 
Washington February 1 to take up his new duties as the Trade 
Ministry's representative at the Peruvian Embassy, and told 
us he had President Garcia's support.  He said he expected 
Hernando de Soto, President Garcia's "special envoy" named in 
August 2006, to now focus on the domestic implementation of 
the PTPA.  The GOP has just retained veteran Washington 
attorney Thomas Boggs to help with the Congressional effort, 
and Lemor will also bring up additional support staff for the 
effort from Lima.  Charge urged him to work closely with 
Washington agencies and to coordinate closely on key issues 
such as labor.  END SUMMARY. 
 
TRADE MINISTRY IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT 
----------------------------------- 

¶2.  (SBU) Lemor (bio reported reftel) told Charge that while 
Peru's Ambassador to the U.S. Felipe Ortiz de Zevallos would 
be heading the mission, he himself would be coordinating the 
GOP's day to day campaign in Washington.  He confirmed that 
lobbying firm Patton Boggs had been hired by the GOP at some 
considerable expense, and that veteran lobbyist Thomas Boggs 
would be personally involved.  Lemor said he would be 
bringing three outside academics to assist him in Washington. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Lemor said that Presidential envoy Hernando de 
Soto, who had openly complained about how frustrating the 
task of lobbying for the PTPA had been, would focus his 
efforts on domestic implementation of the PTPA.  Lemor opined 
that de Soto had had some difficulty working effectively with 
the various ministries, especially the trade ministry.  He 
also said that the locus of control on this current effort 
would be in the Trade Ministry. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Lemor said that President Garcia told him he would 
be willing to make a call to Washington if necessary. Lemor 
said he thought he could count on the pro-FTA ministers in 
the cabinet to support him with the President if necessary. 
That list includes Transport and Telecoms Minister Veronica 
Zavala, Production Minister Rafael Rey and Housing Minister 
Hernan Garrido-Lecca. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 

¶5. (SBU) Lemor's presence in Washington clearly puts the 
Trade Ministry in the driver's seat for the GOP's efforts on 
the PTPA. Lemor said he would likely spend at least six 
months in Washington, to be extended to a year.  Charge urged 
Lemor to be in touch with the broad range of Washington 
agencies as he made his rounds in Washington, such as 
Treasury, Commerce and State, in addition to USTR.  She also 
told Lemor that it was important to keep his eye on the kinds 
of political developments that could arise in Peru that would 
bring the PTPA negative publicity on the Hill.
