(SBU)  MSC Joanna 704A arrived at 2225 hours on Feb 13.  Both 
containers have been offloaded by Dubai Ports Authority and are being 
held by Dubai Customs.  ICE reports that the original seals check out 
-- which means there are no signs of the containers being tampered 
with.  Currently both containers are with Dubai Customs for 
inspection, "cracking" (opening) and then re-sealing.  Dubai Customs 
will provide a detailed report -- and arrangements will be completed 
for re-delivery of the containers to Norfolk, VA - probably next 
week.
