Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Allegations of ceasefire violations appear to be on the 
up-swing in both Chambers of the Ceasefire Commission (CFC).  The 
CFC Chairman formed a sub-committee to review the objectivity of the 
report on the April 1 killing of AMIS soldiers in Umm Barru.  JEM 
described the Sudanese Government's refusal to allow Second Chamber 
representatives to redeploy to the sectors as a violation of the 
Ndjamena Ceasefire and threatened a withdrawal from the CFC. 
Despite the CFC Chairman's efforts to investigate potential 
violations, the Commission's effectiveness is limited by AMIS sector 
commanders' unwillingness to follow-through on investigations.  End 
summary. 
 
--------------------- 
First Chamber: May 21 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) After two meetings without a Sudanese Government 
representative, the US observer asked Major Nasr Taj al-Sir for 
clarification on reports of Government bombing in Deim Bishara. 
Major Nasr responded that it was a police drug eradication 
operation.  Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)/Peace Wing 
representative Mustafa Adam Dawood demanded an investigation, and 
the Chairman tasked Sector 2 to report at the next meeting.  The 
Sudanese Liberation Army/Minawi (SLA/M) representative remarked that 
there had also been reports of "wide-scale looting and killing" in 
the area around Shey Shaaban, and called for a prompt investigation 
and GOS intervention.  Finally, the CFC Chairman Brigadier General 
Ephrem Rurangwa directed members to form a sub-committee to review 
the objectivity of the report of the investigation of the Um Barru 
incident on April 1. 
 
---------------------- 
Second Chamber: May 21 
---------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) SLA/Non-signatory Factions (SLA/NSF) representative Colonel 
Abdou A. Ismail demanded an investigation into two days of bombing 
in North Darfur by the Sudanese Government that began on May 19. 
The Chairman consented and ordered a team and a party representative 
to go to Sector 6 to verify the claim.  Justice and Equality 
Movement (JEM) representative Gen. Mohammed Bashier said that there 
were several attacks by GOS in South Darfur.  In an attack South of 
Geneina, he said eight were killed.  In Manjura, Janjaweed with 
camels and vehicles were spotted.  He said that there were 
indications in several areas that attacks were imminent, and he 
offered the locations to AMIS. 
 
---------------------- 
Second Chamber: May 23 
---------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) JEM representative General Bashier expressed his deep 
frustration with the fact that his men were not deployed to the 
sectors because it means they cannot monitor the ceasefire.  He said 
that Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) First Commander Mohammed Mustafa 
Aldabi's written refusal to allow non-signatory representatives to 
redeploy to the sectors amounted to an abrogation of the Ndjamena 
Ceasefire agreement upon which the Second Chamber was based and said 
JEM and SLA/NSF would have to consider returning to the bush.  He 
called on the international community to pressure the Government to 
allow redeployment.  He promised to issue a statement jointly with 
other non-signatories within the next few days.  (Comment: At many 
sectors, AMIS does not patrol areas without a movement 
representative, which inhibits monitoring of ceasefire violations. 
End Comment.)

First Chamber: May 23 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) When Government representative Maj. Nasr thanked AMIS for 
its help delivering non-military logistical support (NMLS) on May 
22, SLA/Minawi representative Ahmed Gardiya Khamlis said angrily 
that the delivery "had nothing to do with Abuja" because support 
should come from the AU, not from GOS.  He said the matter merited 
no discussion as it did not occur under the framework of the Darfur 
Peace Agreement (DPA).  He accused the Sudanese Government of 
promoting itself to the CFC.  The Chairman explained that in lieu of 
NMLS from the AU, which under the DPA should distribute NMLS only 
after disengagement, redeployment and verification, the Government's 
donation should stand as an attempt toward DPA implementation.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) While the CFC Chairman has shown a willingness to 
investigate potential ceasefire violations brought before the 
commission at Force Headquarters, his Sector Commanders do not 
follow through with investigations.  Where representatives are not 
allowed to deploy by the Government, AMIS sends no patrols or 
investigations.  For this reason, several movement representatives 
say they are eager to share details of attacks with the 
international community, which they hope will keep the pressure on 
the Sudanese Government and AMIS.  End Comment.
