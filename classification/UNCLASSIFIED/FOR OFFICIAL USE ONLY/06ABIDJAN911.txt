REF: ABIDJAN 854 
 
¶1.  (U)  On August 8, Maritime Police officers announced in a 
press conference that on August 4 Minister of Transport Anaky 
Kobenan (leader of the MFA, an opposition party) had issued 
the payment of bonus arrears in the amount of USD 234,000 
(CFAF 117 million) and suspended Director General for 
Maritime Affairs Jean-Christophe Tibet Bi Balou.  In so 
doing, Anaky effectively met the demands of striking Maritime 
Police officers that had resulted in a violent clash between 
security and militia forces (reftel).  During the press 
conference, the police officers announced their support for 
the Minister's actions and called for an audit of office 
accounts and the appointment of a new Director General in 
three months through an internal bidding process. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Tibet Bi Balou resisted his suspension, reporting to 
work with an armed escort on August 8 at the Office of 
Maritime and Port Affairs.  The new Acting Director General, 
Dassie Kobenan (a cousin of Minister Anaky), showed up as 
well, accompanied by his own security escort.  Eventually, 
the former Director General and his guards left the building 
without incident.  However, on August 10, roughly 20 Maritime 
Police officers loyal to Tibet Bi Balou besieged the Office 
of Maritime and Port Affairs and fired shots into the air in 
an effort to prevent the Acting Director General from 
entering, causing panic in the downtown district of Plateau 
where the office is located.  These officers were confronted 
by another group of Maritime Police supporting Dassie 
Kobenan. The standoff required the intervention of Armed 
Forces (FANCI) Chief of Staff General Philippe Mangou. 
Mangou arrived on the scene, calmed the parties down, and 
invited the two factions for talks in his office. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Lt. Yao Koffi, a Maritime Police officer who is a 
supporter of Tibet Bi Balou, told us that his side had 
resisted the suspension of the former Director General 
because the action was illegal absent a Presidential decree. 
He also compained that  the new Acting Director General is aformer 
 
CUSTOMS OFFICERUUUUer, i.e., from outside the Martime 
Police. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Comment:  Until the ipasse is resolved, there 
remains a potential forfurther clashes involving the 
maritime police.  Te situation may be exacerbated by those 
trying t undermine opposition Minister Anaky through suppot 
of Tibet Bi Balou and his faction.
