¶1. (U) Cote d'Ivoire's Ministry of Finance confirms that Cote 
d'Ivoire is funding its commitments to UNITAD via the levy of a 
"solidarity tax" on airline tickets.  Taxes are USD 4 (CFA 2000) per 
ticket for short and medium distance flights (generally flights 
remaining on the African continent), and USD 10 for long distance 
flights (i.e., European destinations). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post underscored with host government officials that 
United States does not intend to join UNITAID, nor does it support 
the use of taxes on airline tickets.
