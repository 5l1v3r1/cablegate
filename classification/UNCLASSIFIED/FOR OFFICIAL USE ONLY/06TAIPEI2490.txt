CODE 
 
 
¶1. (U) A four-member U.S. Coast Guard team visited Taiwan July 17-21 
under the International Port Security Program to examine Taiwan's 
implementation of the International Maritime Organization's 
International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code.  The team 
consisted of Pacific Area Inspections/Investigations Branch Chief 
Stephen Danscuk, Port Security Assessment Specialist Gregory Blake, 
LCDR Yuri Graves and LCDR Richard Kavanaugh.  The team met with 
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) and Taiwan 
Coast Guard officials in Taipei and visited the harbors of Keelung, 
Taichung and Kaohsiung. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Coast Guard team's preliminary findings indicate 
Taiwan's ports are substantially implementing the ISPS Code.  It saw 
room for improvement in Keelung where the older harbor facilities 
are bordered on all sides by urban areas.  However, it identified 
several best practices in each of the Taiwan facilities.  The team 
gave MOTC officials an abbreviated informal report of its findings. 
A more formal report will be delivered to the Taiwan authorities in 
the next three to four months. 
 
¶3. (U) This telegram was cleared by U.S. Coast Guard LCDR Richard 
Kavanaugh.
