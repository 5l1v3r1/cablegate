¶1. (SBU) Special Envoy for the Kosovo Final Status Talks 
Ambassador Frank Wisner asked Arab League Secretary General 
Amre Moussa on February 6 for the League and its member 
states to support an independent Kosovo when Kosovo declares 
its independence in the coming weeks.  Ambassador Wisner 
emphasized that international mediation on Kosovo's final 
status have proven fruitless, and that there is no alternate 
to independence, noting that matters could move with little 
or no warning in the coming weeks.  Moussa asked about the 
reactions of Russia and of Serbia.  Ambassador Wisner replied 
that we expect a strong, but nonetheless non-violent, 
political reaction.  Russia would oppose independence and try 
to block international recognition of Kosovo, but is not 
likely to agitate to divide Kosovo into smaller pieces, he 
continued, and the Serbian leadership has assured us that 
"violence is not an option."  However, individual acts of 
violence are possible.  Moussa promised to convey Ambassador 
Wisner's message of urgency to Arab governments. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Wisner asked Egyptian Foreign Minister 
Ahmed Aboul Gheit for Egypt's support for Kosovo independence 
over lunch on February 27.  Aboul Gheit expressed skepticism 
in a long and detailed exchange, pressing Ambassador Wisner 
on timing: "why should we risk consequences now?"  Ambassador 
Wisner outlined the history of the final status talks and 
argued that current conditions offered the best chance to 
avoid violence.  Ambassador Wisner also warned that matters 
could move rapidly to a conclusion, and cited the recent 
statement by the Government of Turkey to support Kosovo's 
independence.  Aboul Gheit reserved judgment and said he 
would have to consult President Mubarak.
