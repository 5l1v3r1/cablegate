¶1.  Summary: (SBU) Violence has flared again between the 
supporters of candidates for North Maluku Governor.  Local 
ethnic friction and Jakarta party politics have made this far 
flung governor's race drag on for almost six months now.  The 
latest round of violence was reportedly triggered by the June 2 
declaration by the Minister for Home Affairs that the incumbents 
had won reelection.  On June 4, supporters of the challengers 
torched several houses belonging to supporters of the 
incumbents.  June 5 brought more clashes and a cancelled 
inauguration ceremony.  Violent protests in Tidore and Ternate 
continue while all indications are that North Maluku will 
finally install incumbents Thaib Armayn and Abdulgani Kasuba 
whatever the consequences.  The only question is when.  Rumors 
circulate that Vice President Jusuf Kalla's behind-the-scenes 
intervention was again unsuccessful in turning the tide for a 
Golkar candidate.  House Speaker and Golkar Deputy Chairman 
Agung Laksono has suggested that Golkar withdraw support for the 
President's government due to a string of similar electoral 
defeats.  End Summary 
 
Home Affairs Ministry Decision Triggers Violence 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Violence broke out in Ternate on June 3 between the 
supporters of North Maluku Governor challengers Abdul Gafur and 
Fabanyo, supported by Golkar, Party for National Democratic 
Unity (PDK), and National Mandate Party (PAN) and incumbents 
Thaib Armayin and Kasuba, supported by Prosperous Justice Party 
(PKS), Democrat Party, The Crescent Moon Party (PBB), and 
National Awakening Party (PKB).  The clash followed the 
declaration by the Minister of Home Affairs that the incumbents 
had won the long-disputed election.  Supporters of Abdul Gafur 
and Fabanyo blocked the city's main street for three hours. This 
latest decision overturned the recommendation of North Maluku's 
Parliament who met in plenary session in April (Ref A). 
 
Violence on Tidore 
------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) In related violence, four houses were burned and three 
other houses were destroyed on Tidore Island on June 3.  Ternate 
Police told Congen Surabaya that the attack was triggered by the 
Home Affairs Ministry decision and the houses destroyed belonged 
to the supporters of incumbent.  Police sources told us the size 
of the mob was too large to confront and police were unable to 
protect the homes.  In the early morning of June 4, tensions 
were still high on Tidore, but according to Alwi of Diahi Radio, 
violence had not yet spilled over into Ternate. 
 
Police Outmatched by Supporters 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) On June 4, roughly 800 supporters of the challenger 
Abdul Gafur marched from his residence to the Governor's office 
in Ternate to stage a protest that ended by early afternoon. 
Simultaneously supporters of the incumbent Thalib gathered near 
his home in Ternate's Salahudin sub-district.  Similar back and 
fourth skirmishes involving teams of rival supporters throwing 
stones occurred on June 5.  Police put Ternate City on alert and 
put 1,800 police and three companies of Mobile Brigade forces on 
alert to prevent rival supporters from clashing.  Clashes did 
occur, but stayed small and the police were able to disperse the 
crowds from in front of the homes of rival candidates. 
 
Golkar Feels Robbed -- Kalla Weighs In 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Surya Paloh, chairman of Golkar's steering committee, 
told media that Golkar is disappointed with the decision of the 
Minister of Home Affairs but supports the President.  In shades 
of a prior Golkar defeat in South Sulawesi's gubernatorial 
election, Vice President Jusuf Kalla lobbied Minister Mardiyanto 
for almost an hour according to Surya.  The deputy chairman of 
Golkar, Agung Laksono, asked President Yudhoyono not to sign the 
Minister's decision.  Muddying the waters, Idrus Marham, 
Golkar's parliamentary leader threatened to file suit against 
Mardiyanto.  According to Alwi of Diahi Radio, Jakarta is more 
tense than Ternate as Golkar, desperate for a win after a string 
 
SURABAYA 00000070  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
of provincial losses, battles hard for North Maluku.  On June 
10, Agung Laksono hinted that the victory of a candidate from 
the President's party at the expense of one from the Vice 
President's party showed a "lack of proportionality".  This 
threat by Golkar leadership to drop out of President Yudhoyono's 
coalition is an apparent reaction to events in N. Maluku. 
 
Flash Points Remain 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) North Maluku Police told Congen Surabaya that despite 
continued protests, North Maluku's government is prepared to 
comply with the Home Affairs Ministry order.  Police sources 
were hopeful that quick installation of a new governor might end 
the trouble.  However the inauguration has been canceled for the 
time being.  Alwi of Diahi Radio told Congen Surabaya that 
President Yudhoyono has yet to sign the decree installing the 
incumbents.  In another echo of South Sulawesi politics, the 
central government is reportedly being encouraged to appoint 
retired general Tanri Lamo, the former acting governor of South 
Sulawesi, to replace the current caretaker governor. 
 
Complications -- Ethnicity and Corruption 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Indonesian Police are still waiting for permission from 
President Yudhoyono to question Thaib Armayn for allegedly 
misusing around Rp. 6.9 billion (USD) from the state budget. 
Indonesian National Police reportedly took over this case from 
North Maluku Police as the situation in North Maluku remains 
unstable and conflict between supporters of the two governor 
candidates has escalated.  Thaib remains free and is regarded as 
a witness. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Fachmy Alhaidar Secretary of Muslim organization 
Al-Khairat in Ternate told Congen Surabaya on June 6 that while 
ethnic tension normally simmers just below the surface in North 
Maluku, it has erupted into clashes over the gubernatorial 
election.  There are three major Muslim ethnic groups in North 
Maluku: Makian, Petani Maba and Ternate.  While the Makian are 
in the minority, since they tend to be more educated, they are 
disproportionately represented in the provincial bureaucracy. 
The incumbent Thaib Armayn is Makian, and has placed fellow 
Makians throughout the higher echelons of government.  Makian 
bureaucrats are suspected of corruption and nepotism leading the 
other ethnic groups to vote against Thaib Armayn.  They gave 
their support to Abdul Gafur, who is a Petani Maba. Although 
many claimed not to like Abdul Gafur's Air Force background, 
they voted for him anyway since he was the only candidate 
considered strong enough to beat the incumbent.
