SUBJECT: BELGIUM IN FAVOR OF TURKEY'S ACCESSION TO THE EU 
BUT WOULD LIKE MORE PROGRESS ON REFORM 
 
REF: STATE 79278 
 
 Â¶1.  (SBU)  Poloff gave reftel points to MFA Turkey Desk 
Officer Marie Noelle Dubois July 25. Dubois said the Belgian 
position remains in favor of Turkey's accession to the EU, 
dependent upon how Turkey progresses with reforms, and how it 
handles the current court case mentioned in reftel.  The 
Belgians are concerned about the court case but they will not 
speculate as to what will happen.  Dubois said there should 
be an EU declaration once the court reaches its verdict. 
Dubois claims Belgium sees some progress in Turkey, but notes 
that in the last couple of years the climate there has not 
been conducive to reform.
