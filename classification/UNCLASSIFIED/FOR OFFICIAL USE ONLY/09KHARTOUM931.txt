SUBJECT: TECHNICAL BORDER COMMITTEE MAKES LITTLE PROGRESS ON 
DEMARCATION 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Ad Hoc Technical Border Committee, mandated in 
the Comprehensive Peace Committee (CPA) to divide the border between 
North and South Sudan along the January 1, 1956 border, is unlikely 
to complete work by the upcoming September 30, 2009 deadline.  Only 
one of three sectors is nearing completion, and even in that sector 
numerous "holes" remain where the parties could not agree.  The SPLM 
members claim that the Committee's supposedly neutral Chairman and 
Committee staff, all drawn from the north, are biased against the 
SPLM.  Despite these problems, SPLM members continue to attend 
meetings, and believe that the appointment of additional technical 
advisers, drawn from the south, might help move the process forward. 
 UNMIS officials provide technical assistance to the Committee, but 
say "disorganization" prevents the technical advisors from being 
used, and they believe the SPLM's concerns are no more than a 
delaying tactic.  UNMIS technical advisors stand ready to help the 
Committee, but will remain unused until the Committee shows 
willingness to accept assistance.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On August 5, Poloff met with Dr. Riek Garang and Darius 
Garang, SPLM members of the Joint Border Committee, to discuss 
progress toward delineating and demarcating the border.  The parties 
disagree about a number of issues, and are far from finishing work, 
they said.  Demarcation is largely complete for Sector One, Eastern 
Sudan, but large "holes" (areas of the border on which the parties 
are unable to agree), remain.  Committee members even disagree about 
which Sector to work on next, the SPLM Committee members said.  The 
NCP wants to work on Sector Two, which includes the three areas 
region and Central Sudan, while the SPLM argues that the Committee 
should turn next to Sector Three, Darfur, on the grounds that it 
would be easier to agree on that sector.

 SPLM Claims Chairman, Staff Bias 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) SPLM officials also criticized the Chairman of the 
Committee for what they perceive as his bias toward the NCP, and for 
his failure to achieve consensus before taking action.  In 
particular, they note, the Chairman issues statements on behalf of 
the Committee without SPLM agreement on the text.  It would be 
better if the Chairman served as an NCP member of the Committee 
rather than as the supposedly impartial chairman, they said. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The SPLM officials also criticized the Secretariat of the 
Committee.  All eighteen of the Committee's staff is drawn from the 
north, the SPLM officials complained, and ignore the concerns of the 
SPLM.  The staff exhibits bias against the SPLM members and often 
distorts the Minutes of the Committee meetings.  The SPLM members 
also belittled the competence of the staff.  The SPLM members 
suggested that the appointment of additional technical staff drawn 
from the south would help to resolve difficulties and move the 
process forward. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Neither SPLM member believes that the Committee will finish 
its work by September 30.  In response to Poloff's questions, they 
said they were pessimistic that they could reach any agreement with 
their NCP counterparts that would allow them to move forward with 
the work of the Committee.  However, contrary to SPLM claims that 
they are boycotting Committee meetings, SPLM Committee members 
continue to attend meetings, although little, to no progress is 
made.

UNMIS Sees SPLM Delaying Tactic 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) In a separate meeting, UNMIS Civil Affairs officials said 
they, too, doubt that the Committee will finish its work by the 
September 30 deadline.  UNMIS authorities discounted the concerns 
raised by the SPLM, calling them old grievances that should have 
been raised and resolved when the Committee was founded four years 
ago.  The fact that SPLM members began to raise these concerns at 
the very point when the Committee had finally begun to move forward, 
led UNMIS officials to believe that the objections are a delaying 
tactic by the SPLM, UNMIS officials confided. 
 
¶7. (SBU) UNMIS officials also noted that, the Committee lacks the 
organizational capacity to take advantage of available UNMIS 
technical advisors.  Nonetheless, UNMIS officials said, the 
Committee had made some progress, but SPLM intransigence threatens 
to scuttle even the little forward movement. 
 
¶8. (SBU) COMMENT: Political pressure from both the NCP and SPLM 
leadership will be necessary to force the Committee to move forward 
with its work.  First Vice President Kiir's meeting with President 
 
KHARTOUM 00000931  002 OF 002 
 
 
Bashir and Second Vice President Taha on August 9 shows commitment 
to the trilateral agreement to discuss the issues, but so far, 
little action has come of the talks.  Further delays in the 
Committee's work will delay the election.  END COMMENT
