DIALOGUE 
 
REF: A. STATE 75160 
 
     ¶B. DANIELS TO EAP-MTS EMAIL OF 20 JUNE 2007 
 
¶1.  (U) The Malaysian Foreign Ministry confirmed to us on 
July 27 that Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe intends to 
visit Malaysia again in order to attend the Langkawi 
International Dialogue, August 4-8.  According to press 
accounts and the MFA, some 12 to 16 heads of government, 
mostly from African states, have confirmed their attendance. 
The Langkawi Dialogue process, begun some 12 years ago by 
former Prime Minister Mahathir, aims to foster South-South 
partnerships and networking. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On instruction to support an Australian-led 
initiative (ref A), the Ambassador joined his counterparts 
from the Australian, British and New Zealand and Canadian 
high commissions in delivering a demarche on June 20 urging 
Malaysia to restrict the travel of senior Zimbabwe officials. 
The Malaysian Foreign Ministry was not responsive to our 
joint demarche (ref B). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On July 27, Polchief called MFA Under Secretary for 
Africa Azlan Man and asked about Mugabe's travel plans for 
the Langkawi Dialogue.  Azlan stated that Mugabe had been 
invited to the early August event.  After an awkward pause, 
Azlan claimed that he did not know for certain that Mugabe 
would attend (instead, the MFA's secretariat for the event 
provided us with confirmation).  Polchief told Azlan, who had 
attended our June 20 demarche, that news of Mugabe's visit 
would be very disappointing to countries like the U.S. that 
had urged Malaysia to restrict the travel of senior Zimbabwe 
officials.  Azlan declined to engage in further conversation 
after we made our point. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  We see no prospect of Malaysia turning 
off Mugabe's attendance at the Langkawi Dialogue.  We are 
encouraging, however, the high commissions of Australia, UK, 
New Zealand and Canada to join us in registering 
disappointment with Malaysia's decision.
