 ¶1. (SBU) Summary: On March 19, MFA Political Director Kai 
Eide briefed the EU/NATO ally countries on the GON decision 
over the weekend to have direct political contacts with the 
Palestinian National Unity Government (NUG).  He explained 
that the GON welcomed the NUG because: 
 
--the NUG is taking steps toward complying with international 
  community requirements, as demonstrated by the Mecca 
  Agreement and the NUG platform; 
--the NUG is important to ending the inter-Palestinian 
  violence and creating stability in Palestine; 
--the NUG provides a broad basis for Abbas to negotiate with 
  Israel. 
 
End Summary 
 
¶2. (SBU) The alternative, Eide said, would be continued 
violence, a weakened Abbas; and the undercutting of moderate 
Arab states who were heavily engaged in creating the NUG. 
Eide commended Abbas for his efforts and explained the GON 
has been constantly in touch with Abbas throughout the 
process.  The GON sees the Mecca Agreement, the NUG platform 
and the statements by the Palestinian Prime Minister as 
containing positive elements.  While not ideal, they do 
provide a foundation from which to move forward.  Eide 
stressed the GON hopes that its action will lead to more 
moderation by Palestinians and others in the wider region. 
Eide briefed that the GON will have direct contacts with the 
NUG based on functional needs, not party affiliation.  They 
look to work closely with the NUG Finance Minister in 
determining how to move back to normality and end the 
&perversion of the Palestinian economy.8 
 
¶3. (SBU) Eide stressed that the GON decision is not a carte 
blanche.  Instead, the GON will assess how the NUG policies 
and actions comply with the international requirements in 
particular regarding: 
 
--recognition of Israel; 
--renunciation of violence; 
--stability in Palestine; 
--end to rocket attacks; 
--release of the Israeli solider held captive; 
--recognition of previous international laws; and 
--political and economic reforms within Palestine. 
 
In regard to the latter, the GON found the Palestinian Prime 
Minister,s emphasis on reform encouraging.  Eide 
re-emphasized that the GON will be looking for more than just 
words, and will monitor actions.  He pointed out however that 
the GON had at this point concluded it should build on what 
has been achieved because the costs of not doing so are very 
high. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Eide then briefed on State Secretary Johansen,s 
ongoing visit to Palestine.  Meetings with the Prime Minister 
and Foreign Minister have already taken place and meetings 
with Abbas and the Finance Minister are scheduled.  At the 
meetings, Johansen is offering support but also clearly 
explaining Norway,s expectations for positive action.  He 
has specifically said that the GON will modulate its 
relationship based on performance.  In the meeting with the 
Prime Minister, Johansen explicitly urged the release of the 
Israeli solider and the BBC journalist.  At the meeting with 
the Foreign Minister, Johansen stressed Norway,s 
interpretation of the Mecca Agreement and the NUG platform as 
implicitly recognizing previous UN resolutions.  The Foreign 
Minister confirmed that this interpretation was one he shares. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In a question and answer session that followed, Eide 
emphasized that the GON will not distinguish between Hamas, 
Fatah, and Independent Ministers in their contact with the 
NUG.  With the NUG, the GON will meet at political levels. 
However, with the Hamas party, the GON will continue to meet 
only at the civil servant level.  On the type of financial 
assistance and mechanism for it, Eide said this would depend 
on the discussions with the Finance Minister.  Responding to 
questions about Israeli,s reaction (note:  Israel was not 
invited, nor were other non-NATO, non-EU states), Eide said 
he could not speak to other country,s views but said that 
the best diplomacy comes when strength is combined with 
engagement.  One without the other will lead to failure, but

the combination can foster moderation.  In response to the 
DCMs question regarding the Palestinian Prime Minister,s 
statement that violence will continue, Eide re-emphasized 
that the GON will modulate its policy based on the behavior 
of the new government.  The GON reads the question of 
resistance in the Palestinian PM's statement as coming within 
the context of international norms and charters.
