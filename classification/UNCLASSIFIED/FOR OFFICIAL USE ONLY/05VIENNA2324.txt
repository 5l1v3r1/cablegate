¶1.  (U) EconPolCouns delivered ref (a) demarche on July 7 to 
Wolfgang Lapuh, acting head of the Austrian Foreign 
Ministry's Middle East and Africa division. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Lapuh said Austria had been prepared to provide 
training on constitutional issues to Iraqis, and had offered 
this to the Iraqi government (see ref d).  However, per ref 
(a), this was no longer a point of focus.  This was the 
extent of the assistance in the constitutional field that 
Austria had envisaged, Lapuh said.  However, Austria had 
provided assistance in other fields, including training for 
Iraqi diplomats and police training.
