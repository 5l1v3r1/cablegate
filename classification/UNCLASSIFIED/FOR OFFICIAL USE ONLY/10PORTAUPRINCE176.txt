SUBJECT: PORT-AU-PRINCE: FEBRUARY 12 CODEL PELOSI VISIT TO HAITI 
 
¶1.      (SBU)  SUMMARY:  On February 12 Speaker of the House of 
Representatives Nancy Pelosi, along with the 11 Senators and 
members of Congress, arrived in Port-au-Prince to observe U.S. 
relief efforts and to discuss the status of those efforts with US 
and GOH officials.  President Preval told the Codel they are 
rallying to address the monumental challenges confronting them, and 
with a vision that looks beyond Haiti's immediate needs.  Preval 
stated that, in the short-term, Haiti needs help in addressing the 
problems of displaced persons, a budget shortfall, stimulating the 
economy, and holding elections.  Preval also asked for assistance 
in encouraging U.S. private investment, decentralizing foreign 
investment, creating jobs, and building roads.  Prime Minister 
Bellerive supported the concept of establishing a trusteeship 
comprised of the GOH and major donors to coordinate the 
disbursement of financial aid.  END SUMMARY.

CODEL Itinerary 
 
 
 
¶3.      (SBU)  Charge' David Lindwall, U.S. Relief Coordinator 
Ambassador Lewis Lucke, and U.S. Joint Task Force (JTF) Commander 
General Ken Keen briefed the CODEL on the present situation and 
Embassy, JTF, and USAID/DART activities in support of relief 
efforts.  The CODEL took a windshield tour of the city center 
stopping briefly at the ruins of the Capital's historic cathedral, 
where the CODEL observed a moment of silence for those who died in 
earthquake.  (NOTE:  Preval had designated February 12 as a 
national day of mourning.  END NOTE.)  CODEL members also toured a 
USAID-sponsored emergency medical facility and discussed the 
delivery of humanitarian aid with key NGO representatives. 
 
Discussion with President Preval, PM Bellerive and Cabinet Members 
 
 
 
¶4.      (SBU)  The CODEL met with President Rene' Preval, Prime 
Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, and members of Preval's staff and 
cabinet at the GOH's temporary HQ.  Preval thanked President and 
 
Mrs. Obama, the U.S. Congress, and the American people for bringing 
all possible aid to Haiti.  Speaker Pelosi conveyed the concerns of 
Congress and the American people for the welfare of Haiti and added 
that the CODEL was present to demonstrate America's commitment to 
Haiti. 
 
 
 
¶5.      (SBU)  Preval noted the GOH has made "much progress" since 
the earthquake.  He explained the government had removed 217,000 
bodies from the rubble, and it is working to clear roads and 
re-establish telephone and electricity service.  He added that 
USAID has done a tremendous job of providing food to displaced 
person camps.  In response to Senator Harken, who urged the 
government to move displaced person camps in low areas to higher 
ground, Preval replied USAID is working to accomplish that goal. 
But first, he said, the rubble must be removed, "one thing at a 
time." 
 
GOH Short Term Needs 
 
 
 
¶6.      (SBU)  Preval said there will be tremendous social problems 
if displaced persons remain in the streets.  "We must not weaken 
the economy" with the large amount of aid pouring into Haiti. 
Instead of distributing imported food, he explained, there is a 
need to stimulate the economy and support agricultural jobs by 
buying local products whenever possible.  Preval acknowledged the 
establishment of a USAID program to address those issues, but he 
added that more local jobs must be created. 
 
 
 
¶7.      (SBU)  Preval asked for elections support, noting the 
Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) building was destroyed in the 
quake and that it lost personnel, election records, and election 
materials.  Many citizens had lost their voter identification cards 
and have moved out of their voting districts, he continued.  Preval 
explained that on May 10, Parliament's mandate expires and without 
the House of Deputies and only two-thirds of the Senators still in 
office, "we have a problem."  (NOTE:  The parliamentary elections 
originally scheduled for February 2010 have been cancelled.  END 
NOTE) 
 
 
 
Post-Quake Budget Issues - Ultimately Cured by Economic Development 
and Job Creation 
 
 
 
¶8.      (SBU)  Finance Minister Baudin said following the quake, 
GOH revenues had plummeted by 80 percent due to lack of income and 
property tax receipts.  Preval added the owners of 250,000 damaged 
homes would no longer pay property taxes.  The temporary closure of 
the main port had also resulted in the loss of import duties, 
according to Baudin.  The remaining 20 percent of GOH revenues does 
not cover one-half of the payroll for public employees, which 
amounts to USD 25 million per month.  The government has been able 
to meet the public employee payroll thanks to a budget surplus; but 
without future budget support from foreign donors, making the 
government payroll will be difficult.  "We ask for a lobbying 
effort," Baudin said, "to attract U.S. private investment in 
Haiti," which will create jobs and increase government receipts. 
Furthermore, it is important to create those jobs outside of 
Port-au-Prince if possible, so that those who have migrated out of 
the capital will not be compelled to return. 
 
 
 
¶9.      (SBU)  Central Bank President Castel said, as a result of 
destroyed businesses and loan defaults, 40 percent of Haiti's 
banks' portfolios may have been lost.  Those businesses can rebuild 
only if credit is available, commenting "we need to extend credit 
in order to create jobs," and added "we cannot raise revenue 
without jobs."  Castel urged the American legislators to include 
funds to recapitalize the banks in any budget supplemental. 
Senator Harkin mentioned that Congress will be considering a 
supplemental appropriation bill, and requested a list of GOH needs 
for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
 
Coordination of Expenditures - Trusteeship Proposal 
 
 
 
¶10.  (SBU)  Senator Nelson suggested that the GOH establish a 
trusteeship with authority to disburse funds contributed by donors. 
Prime Minister Bellerive stated that he discussed the subject of a 
trusteeship with Counselor Cheryl Mills, and that the GOH supports 
the idea, provided the body would be transparent.  Bellerive added 
that the trusteeship should be governed by an "International Donor 
Board" consisting of the largest donors, and co-chaired by the GOH. 
He suggested the body should first adopt a plan and then vote to 
disburse funds for projects consistent with the plan.  Bellerive 
said the GOH would propose this structure to the donors meeting in 
April. 
 
 
 
Think Big and Outside of Port-au-Prince 
 
 
 
¶11.  (SBU)  Speaker Pelosi urged Preval to "think big."  "We're 
receptive" she added, "and we would like to hear that Haiti is 
going toward a different place.  If so, you would receive even more 
support, and we see this as an opportunity to be even more 
helpful."  "You can teach the world how to respond to such a 
disaster, and become a model."  Pelosi stated that sometimes such a 
tragedy can be a great opportunity, and suggested the examples of 
San Francisco and Italy. 
 
 
 
¶12.  (SBU)  Preval replied that since 2004, Haiti has made 
significant progress in reducing inflation, growing GDP, expanding 
agricultural production and adding jobs.  But now, after the 
earthquake, it would be a mistake to focus only on Port-au-Prince. 
"To concentrate on the disaster in Port-au-Prince in the wrong 
route," he said.  If Haiti is to continue its progress, and exceed 
it, "the country needs to decentralize" stated Preval.   "We must 
not only rebuild Port-au-Prince, but also Haiti."  In order to 
decentralize, "we need to develop jobs in Les Cayes, Cap Haitien, 
and other cities - but first we need roads."  "We must invest in 
the provinces, or we will not be able to rebuild Port-au-Prince." 
 
 
 
Comment 
 
 
 
¶13.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Preval was in top form during the Pelosi 
meeting: energized, engaged, organized, articulate and gracious. 
Preval and his advisors demonstrated they are fully aware of the 
monumental challenges confronting them, and with a vision that 
looks beyond immediate relief and reconstruction needs.
