¶1.  (SBU) On March 20, Poloff met with MFA West Asia and Africa 
Department Southern Africa Desk Officer Cao Vu Mai to deliver reftel 
points on building international support for democracy in Zimbabwe. 
Poloff also left a copy of the Secretary's and Department 
Spokesman's statements.  When asked for the GVN's position on the 
situation, Mai pointed out that Zimbabwe is far from Vietnam and 
that Vietnam does not have an embassy there.  She hopes the African 
Union will help, since it is "their problem," but in the same breath 
said "it is up to the people of Zimbabwe to solve the problem 
themselves."  She referred to remarks by South African President 
Thabo Mbeki that "the situation in Zimbabwe does not affect its 
neighbors" and that "problems in Zimbabwe should be solved by the 
Zimbabwe people themselves."  South Africa, as a neighbor of 
Zimbabwe, should understand better than the GVN, added Mai.  She 
also cited Russia and China's blocking of action on Zimbabwe at the 
UN, suggesting an international consensus on Zimbabwe is lacking, 
and the failure of African Union Chairman Kufuor to propose any 
concrete action.  Poloff reiterated that the Government of 
Zimbabwe's actions violate its basic human rights obligations and 
that a strong, unified response by the international community could 
bring about positive change. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment.  In light of Vietnam's strong candidacy for a 
2008-2009 seat on the UN Security Council, the GVN's reaction to the 
current situation in Zimbabwe indicates it will take some work to 
ensure that they "get it" when it comes to issues like this.  End 
comment.
