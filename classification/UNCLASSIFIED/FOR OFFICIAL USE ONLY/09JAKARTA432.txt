SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR UPDATE ON PT PRIMA TRANSSHIPMENT INVESTIGATION 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post requests that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
advise us of the status of the transshipment investigation involving 
shrimp exported by the company PT Prima.  Post asks that CBP provide 
the results of the sample testing from CBP's January 2009 visit in 
advance of any public announcement or notification to the Government 
of Indonesia (GOI).  Post also requests appropriate talking points 
and press guidance for use in explaining CBP's final determination 
to GOI officials. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Shrimps exports are a sensitive and important industry in 
Indonesia.  The PT Prima case continues to draw press attention and 
concern from GOI officials.  Minister of Trade Mari Pangestu has 
raised the issue several times in official letters to the USG.  Once 
CBP notifies the GOI of the results of its investigation, Post needs 
to be prepared to respond quickly, substantively and accurately to 
press and GOI inquiries.  In addition, official USG visitors to 
Indonesia should also be advised in advance of any developments in 
this investigation.  For example, Assistant United States Trade 
Representative Barbara Weisel will visit Jakarta March 17 to 19 and 
will meet with the Ministers of Trade and Industry; both will likely 
raise the issue. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Background: U.S. Customs and Border Patrol visited 
Indonesia January 20 to 28 as part of an investigation into the 
possible transshipment of shrimp from China by Indonesia-based PT 
Prima.  The objective of the visit was to obtain samples from 
sources owned by PT Prima for analysis by CBP in the U.S.  The 
analysis would determine whether containers of PT Prima frozen 
shrimp currently held by CBP would be assessed transshipment 
penalties or released for delivery to U.S. customers.
