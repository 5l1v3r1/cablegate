Dear Mr. Ambassador: 
 
On 7 April 2006, the German Bundestag adopted a resolution 
establishing the 1st Committee of Inquiry of the 16th 
electoral term.  Under the mandate established by Parliament, 
the Committee is to clarify still unresolved questions, make 
assessments and draw the necessary conclusions in connection 
with a report presented by the German Federal Government "on 
events relating to the Iraq War and combating international 
terrorism". 
 
Please refer to enclosure 1 for details of the Committee of 
Inquiry's mandate. 
 
At its meeting on 14 December 2006, the Committee of Inquiry 
decided to cordially request the Government of the United 
States of America to support the parliamentary work of the 
Committee. 
 
On behalf of the members of the Committee, I would like to 
express the hope that you will find yourself able to provide 
information of importance for the Committee of Inquiry 
fulfilling its mandate. 
 
In line with the Committee's Decision to take Evidence, which 
I also enclose for your information (Decision to take 
Evidence 16-219, enclosure 2), we request your assistance 
regarding the questioning of Murat Kurnaz by German officials 
in Guantanamo. 
 
The Committee would be grateful if the Government of the 
United States of America were prepared to send the specified 
video recordings. 
 
I would like to thank you for your readiness to receive and 
examine the requests of the German Bundestag. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Siegfried Kauder 
Chairman of the 1st Committee of Inquiry
