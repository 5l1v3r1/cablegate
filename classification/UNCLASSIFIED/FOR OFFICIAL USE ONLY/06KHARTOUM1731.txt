SUBJECT:  Update on South Darfur Inter-Arab Conflict 
 
¶1. (SBU) According to AMIS sources, a July 11 argument over grazing 
rights for livestock between a local farmer and a herder escalated 
into a tribal conflict between the Habaniya and the Rezeigat tribes 
in the El Ferdous and Buram area of South Darfur State.  Initial 
reports state that 60 Habaniya and 44 Rezeigat were killed in 
fighting and 106 Habaniya and 145 Reizeigat were wounded in fighting 
that lasted from July 12 - 16.  (Note:  these casualty figures are 
uncorroborated, and seem to be quite high.  End note.)  This series 
of events, however, has resulted in a suspension of humanitarian 
operations in the area. 
 
¶2. (SBU) AMIS sources further indicate that the South Darfur State 
Wali (governor) and Ed Daien Commissioner visited the area on July 
14 to been with tribal leaders in an effort to end hostilities.  On 
July 19, the Sudan News agency (SUNA) announced that the two tribal 
chiefs (Habaniya Chief Salah Ali al-Ghali and Rezeigat Chief Saidf 
Musa Madibo) had signed an accord for the cessation of hostilities 
and agreed to rely upon traditional means of resolving disputes in 
the future.  The account further states that the agreement 
stipulated that any offender is to be regarded as a lawbreaker, and 
that the official Investigation Committee would examine the 
situation and take actions to resolve the situation.  Both sides 
agreed on the return of internally displaced persons to their home 
areas.
