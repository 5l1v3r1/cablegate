SUBJECT: Germany's Defense Budget: Still Scraping Bottom Despite 
Small Increase for 2008 
 
-------- 
Summary 
-------- 
¶1. (SBU) Despite a nominal increase of 900 million Euro over last 
year, the German defense budget for 2008 will fall far below the 
NATO target of 2% of GDP.  Transformation will remain underfunded, 
as plans to free money for investments by reducing operational 
expenses have not materialized. 
 
------------------------- 
Nominal Increases, But ... 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) The German parliament approved the 2008 defense budget on 
November 28.  With 29.3 billion Euro in 2008 (German fiscal years 
are equal to the calendar year), the German MOD will have 918 
million Euro more available than in 2007 (28.4 billion). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Despite the nominal increase, the German military's share 
of the national budget continues to shrink.  The German national 
budget will increase by 4.7 percent in 2008, whereas the MOD budget 
was raised by only 3.2 percent.  The German defense budget, around 
1.2% of GDP, remains far below the NATO target of 2%. 
 
¶4. (U) Defense spending continues to lack support in the German 
public.  While most defense experts agree that the MOD needs more 
money to fulfill its tasks, a recent poll by the Bundeswehr 
Institute for Social Sciences revealed that more than 80 percent of 
Germans feel their country is already sufficiently secure. 
 
--------------- 
Transformation 
--------------- 
 
¶5. (U) In 2003, the MOD announced plans to transform the Bundeswehr 
into an expeditionary force, giving out-of-area deployments a clear 
priority as outlined in the "Bundeswehr Concept."  This decision was 
based on the presumption that the MOD budget would be increased over 
the following years.  As things turned out, the Bundeswehr received 
1.6 billion Euro less during the period 2003-07 than forecast in 
¶2003. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The 900 million Euro increase in 2008 will bring the 
defense budget closer to the 2003 projections in nominal terms, but 
once inflation, a three percent VAT increase since 2007 and sorely 
needed new projects (such as  the renovation program for German 
garrisons) are taken into account, there is not much growth in real 
terms. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The MOD attempted to free resources for transformation by 
cutting operational expenses.  Operational expenditure have been 
reduced from 18.5 billion Euro in 2003 to 16.9 billion Euro in 2008. 
 At the same time investment grew from 5.8 billion to 6.9 billion 
Euro. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The Bundeswehr will be unable to procure any large ticket 
items before 2015, because of ongoing defense investment programs 
that have exhausted the budget until then: 
 
-- Eurofighter (180 aircraft, 18 billion Euro, last delivery 2014), 
 
-- A400M air lift (60 aircraft, 8.6 billion Euro), 
 
-- NH90 and MH 90 (navy version) mid-size transport helicopters to 
replace the Bell UH-1 D (122 NH90, 30 MH90) helicopters, 5.2 billion 
Euro 
 
-- "Tiger" Attack Helicopter (80 helicopters, 3.1 billion Euro) 
 
-- PUMA combat vehicle (410 vehicles, 3 billion Euro, to be 
delivered between 2010-2020), 
 
¶9. (SBU) Despite the budget limitations until 2015, the delay of the 
A400M and helicopter programs could provide the Bundeswehr with some 
flexibility to fund an interim solution until the A400M becomes 
operational.  EADS, the manufacturer of the A400M, has officially 
announced a one-year delay in delivery of the aircraft, but most 
defense analysts agree that the A400M will not be operationally 
available to the Bundeswehr before 2012.

Comment

¶10. (SBU) The German MOD continues to face the challenge of seeking 
more resources from a society that remains deeply skeptical of the 
military and unconvinced about the need for overseas deployments.

The increases in 2008 are marginal and do not resolve the structural 
difficulties that confront Bundeswehr transformation.
