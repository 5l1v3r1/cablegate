(SBU)  Per reftel, we spoke with GOF authorities about the 
French taking the lead on a multilateral approach to resolve 
the impasse in the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) with 
the Chinese and Brazilians over creating a set of counter- 
terrorism finance best practices that reference the 
Financial Action Task Force.  According to Regis Pelissier, 
director for the Ministry of Economy's office of 
International Finance and Monetary Systems, France already 
presented its bilateral demarche to the Chinese, to no 
avail.  We also spoke with Claudia Delmas-Scherer, Deputy in 
the MFA office for security in the bureau for strategic 
affairs, security and disarmament, who confirmed that 
France's bilateral efforts had borne no fruit.  She 
expressed doubt that France could construct a multilateral 
solution in the FATF, noting that its Presidency ends June 
30, but suggested that another possible forum might be the 
G7. She presumed that the UK would be amenable to take up 
the issue as it assumes the G7 Presidency.  She added that 
France, of course, would join in any multilateral approach, 
including instructing its Embassies to engage in joint 
demarches.
