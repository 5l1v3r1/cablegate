¶A.  SITE ASSESSMENTS AND MEETINGS DURING REPORTING PERIOD: 
 
¶1. (SBU) On November 3, the Advisor spoke at an Export 
Administration Regulations Seminar organized by the Ministry of 
Knowledge Economy of the Republic of Korea.  Over 150 
representatives of Korean and foreign subsidiary companies attended 
the Seminar.  The Seminar was followed by one-on-one counseling 
sessions on November 4.  The Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) of the 
Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs is considering organizing a 
similar program for Taiwan companies so that they can become 
familiar and comply with U.S. export control rules. 
 
¶2. (SBU) on November 13 and 26, the Advisor met with BOFT to review 
the progress of Internal Control Program (ICP) software development 
and the train-the-trainer course materials for the software.  The 
software is slated to be completed by the end of December and the 
train-the-trainer program to take place during January 2009. 
 
¶3. (SBU) on November 25, the Advisor met with officials of the 
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) of the Executive Yuan to get a status 
report on Taiwan's plans to liberalize semiconductor equipment 
exports to China.  The MAC official stated that the liberalization 
plan is still under discussion.  He added that, currently, Taiwan 
authorities at all levels are focused on economic development 
vis-a-vis China, not on national security or nonproliferation 
issues. 
 
¶B. BLUE LANTERN: 
 
(SBU)  No checks were conducted by the Advisor during the reporting 
period. 
 
III. TRAINING CONDUCTED DURING REPORTING PERIOD: 
 
(SBU) No training was conducted during the reporting period.

(SBU) On December 10-11, an Industry-Government Outreach Program, 
implemented by the Department of Energy, will be held in Taichung. 
Approximately 15 Taiwan officials and 60 company representatives are 
expected to attend.  The goal of the program is to increase 
industry's awareness of its export control responsibilities.  A full 
day will be devoted to presentations and demonstration of the ICP 
software, a tool that companies can use to comply with export 
control laws and regulations.
