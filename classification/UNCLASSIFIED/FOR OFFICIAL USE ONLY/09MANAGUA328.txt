(SBU) On Thursday, March 26, 2009, during a previously 
scheduled meeting with Ministry of Foreign Relations (MINREX) 
Director for American Affairs Renee Morales and Political 
Analyst Jane Mary Rivera we discussed IAHRC U.S. candidate 
Diane Shelton.  We delivered points and CV in English as 
instructed per REFTEL and promised to provide CV in Spanish 
once it was available.  Morales thanked us for the 
information, including the names of the other candidates. 
She added that Mexico planned to send its candidate to 
Nicaragua during the week of March 30 to meet with senior 
MINREX and GON officials.  Morales also planned to relay our 
points and the CV to MINREX Division of International 
Organization and Office of Legal Affairs.
