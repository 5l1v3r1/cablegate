(SBU)  Acting PolCouns delivered reftel demarche to MFA 
Deputy Director General for Human Rights Fernando 
Fernandez-Arias on August 28.  Fernandez-Arias was aware of 
the EU approach on the issue and said that Spain preferred to 
handle issues such as this at the EU level as it provided 
more weight than an individual demarche.  He committed to 
share the information with the Political Director and the 
Deputy DG for the Middle East Alberto Ucelay, but he 
expressed his belief that Spain would wait to see whether EU 
efforts made any headway in getting Syria to allow Seif to 
exit the country before considering a bilateral approach.
