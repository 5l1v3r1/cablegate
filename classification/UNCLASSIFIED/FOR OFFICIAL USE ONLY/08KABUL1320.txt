¶1. (SBU) The Ambassador told a delegation of General 
Dostum's parliamentary defenders May 22 that the USG would 
not intervene with the government on behalf of the Uzbek 
warlord. Dostum's only recourse is to surrender himself 
immediately to the attorney general and submit to the legal 
system. The MPs should think carefully about what it means 
for them to be advocating concessions because they feared 
violence from Dostum's supporters. What kind of 
Afghanistan did they want? 
 
¶2. (SBU) Lower house MP Faizullah Zaki (Uzbek, Jawzjan) and 
Dostum's brother, upper house Senator Abdul Qader Dostum 
(Uzbek, Jawzjan), led the group of 15 northern province 
National Assembly members. In addition to the fate of 
their beleaguered patron, they registered concern over 
rising food prices and shortages, which have been 
exacerbated in the north by late and insufficient seasonal 
rains. 
 
¶3. (SBU) As the delegation departed the Embassy, MPs Shakar 
Kargar (Uzbek, Faryab) and Rahman Oghly (Uzbek, Faryab) 
complained Zaki had presented a false picture of universal 
support for Dostum among the north's Uzbeks. Kargar and 
Oghly's effort to distance themselves from the general may 
be indicative of the split between loyalists and 
modernizers among the predominantly Uzbek Junbesh party. 
The party's June conference and its leadership elections 
will be an opportunity to break definitively with Dostum.
