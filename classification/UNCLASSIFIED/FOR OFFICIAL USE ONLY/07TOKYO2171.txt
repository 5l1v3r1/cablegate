directly to the hotel or the Narita Express (NEX) train to 
Tokyo Station and then a taxi to the hotel.  The limousine

is 3,000 Yen.  The NEX train is located in the basement of 
the airport terminal.  The train fare is 2,900 Yen.

Embassy Laptop Policy

¶6. (U) The Embassy's laptop policy is as follows:  Absolutely 
no personal, non-government owned laptop computers may enter 
the Embassy.  Absolutely no laptop, even government owned, 
may be connected to the Embassy network in any way.  TDY 
employees are reminded that no government owned laptops may 
enter the Embassy without prior RSO approval.  Absolutely no 
laptop, even government owned, inside CAA areas unless 
special pre-approval, based on business need, has been given. 
 If you would like to bring a US government owned and 
provided laptop computer into the Embassy, please contact the 
RSO's office prior to your visit for the briefing and 
approval.

Threat Assessment 
----------------- 
 
¶7.  (U) U.S. Government facilities worldwide remain at a 
heightened state of alert.  As the U.S. Government has 
reported in public announcements over the last several 
months, U.S. citizens and interests abroad may be at 
increased risk of terrorist actions from extremist groups, 
which may target civilians and include suicide operations. 
Most recently, we advised that we had unconfirmed information 
that terrorist actions may be taken against U.S. Military 
facilities and/or establishments frequented by U.S. military 
personnel in Korea and Japan.  Americans should increase 
their security awareness and avoid locations where Americans 
are generally known to congregate.  The Department will 
continue to develop information about potential threats to 
Americans overseas and to share credible threat information 
through its consular information program documents available 
on the internet at the Bureau of Consular Affairs home page: 
http://www.travel.state.gov. 
 
¶8.  (U) In addition, we continue to be concerned about 
information we received in May 2001 that American citizens 
may be the target of a terrorist threat from extremist groups 
with links to Usama Bin Laden's Al-Qaida organization.  In 
the past, such individuals have not distinguished between 
official and civilian targets.  The Embassy takes all threats 
seriously.  The U.S. Embassy Tokyo can be contacted 24 hours 
a day at 03-3224-5000 (locally) or 81-3-3224-5000 
(internationally). 
 
¶9.  (SBU) The general threat from crime in Tokyo and 
throughout Japan is low.  Crime is at levels well below the 
U.S. national average.  Violent crime is rare, but does 
exist.  The Japanese National Police report continued 
problems with pick-pocketing of foreigners in crowded 
shopping areas of Tokyo.  Although street crime is low, 
common sense security measures are advised for all American 
citizens traveling in Japan. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Visitors are urged to maintain a high level of 
vigilance and to increase their security awareness. 
Americans should maintain a low profile, vary routes and 
times for all required travel, and treat mail and packages 
from unfamiliar sources with suspicion.  Visitors are also 
urged to avoid contact with any suspicious, unfamiliar 
objects, and to report the presence of such objects to local 
authorities.  Vehicles should not be left unattended and 
should be kept locked at all times.
