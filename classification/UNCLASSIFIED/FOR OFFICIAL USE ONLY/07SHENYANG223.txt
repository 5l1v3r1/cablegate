 ¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Brilliance Automotive plans to delay its 
entry into the United States market while it resolves safety 
and environmental standards issues for its line of high-end 
sedans.  The company cites a return to profitability and a 
desire to make its market debut a clear success as the main 
reasons for conducting extensive testing and redesign. 
Brilliance is also moving to establish a sedan assembly plant 
in Russia and is in negotiations with General Electric to set 
up in-house financing for retail and fleet sales as well as 
dealer inventory.  End Summary 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Shenyang's Huachen Brilliance Automotive has 
adopted a new, more cautious approach to its entry into the 
United States market.  According to Huachen Chief Financial 
Officer, Lei Xiaoyang, Huachen will delay its first United 
States sales until at least mid-year 2008.  The company had 
previously planned its American introduction for fall of 
¶2007.  Mr. Lei attributed the delay to a desire on Huachen's 
part to make sure that their vehicles not only met all U.S. 
safety and environmental standards, but were able to be 
classified as being at the high end of the quality scale. 
Mr. Lei said that they wished to be "more like Toyota than 
Kia."  The return to profitability had also lessened the 
pressure on the company to rush its entry into the U.S. 
market, according to Mr. Lei. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Brilliance introduced its vehicles to the European 
market in December, 2006.  While the vehicles passed all 
required safety tests at that time, the company suffered a 
public relations setback when their vehicles performed poorly 
on another, optional, safety test.  Despite the setback, Mr. 
Lei said that European sales had exceeded expectations and 
were a key to the company's return to profitability after 
several years of losses. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In order to enhance quality and crashworthiness, 
Brilliance has hired senior quality-control engineers from 
BMW, with whom Brilliance has a joint venture that 
manufactures BMW's 3 and 5 series vehicles for the China 
market.  Since U.S. safety standards differ substantially 
from those in Europe, Mr. Lei said the company had contracted 
with U.S. safety-consulting firms to redesign the crumple 
zones in the sedans bound for the U.S. market.  In September, 
2007 the company shipped 90 (ninety) full- and mid-size 
sedans to Detroit for the crash testing.  Data from the 
testing will be used in the redesign process. At the same 
time, the company shipped several vehicles to California to 
enable the re-design of the emissions system.  Mr. Lei said 
Brilliance plans to use California's strict standards as a 
baseline for all of its U.S.-bound vehicles. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) In addition to targeting the U.S. market, 
Brilliance is also poised for a major effort to penetrate the 
Russian market, according to Mr. Lei.  In order to make this 
push, Brilliance will be establishing an assembly plant for 
its sedans in Russia with a planned opening in late 2008. 
While Brilliance assembles its minivans in a variety of 
locations outside of China, the Russian venture will be its 
first effort to assemble sedans outside of China. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Reporting on Huachen's (Brilliance Automotive,s 
parent group,s) efforts to set up a financing arm for its 
domestic sales. Mr. Lei said that talks with GE Financial to 
set up a joint venture were progressing well toward setting 
up a financing arm that can provide loans for retail and 
fleet sales, as well as financing dealer inventory.  He said 
that while Brilliance had initially proposed the venture for 
the China market only, GE preferred to include China, U.S. 
and European operations in the financing venture.
