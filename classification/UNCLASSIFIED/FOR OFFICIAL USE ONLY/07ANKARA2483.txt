¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 5.

GOT Concerned about Outbreak Spread 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 1, we met with Ministry of Health Department 
Head for Communicable Diseases Dr. Mehmet Ali Torunoglu to discuss 
the cholera outbreak in Northern Iraq (reftel).  Torunoglu said the 
GOT is very concerned that cholera could spread into Turkey from 
Iraq but so far no cholera cases have been reported in Turkey. 
Given high volumes of large cross border traffic, the GOT has taken 
several measures to lower the risk of transmission.  They have set 
up a 24-hour health check point at Habur gate including on-call 
doctor, nurse, ambulance and equipment.  If cholera is suspected, 
affected persons will be held under observation until a negative 
result is confirmed.  So far, there haven't been any border 
detentions.  Also at the border, the GOT is distributing 
informational leaflets and prohibiting the importation of water and 
raw fruits and vegetables.  Local hospitals and medical centers in 
provinces bordering on Iraq have been asked to collect samples from 
anyone with cholera symptoms.  The GOT also has set up local 
laboratories to analyze samples and has increased the chlorination 
in city water for these provinces. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Despite these measures, Torunoglu fears that continued hot 
weather and large border trade will mean the disease likely will 
lead to infections in Turkey.  According to the latest information 
from the WHO, there have been 11 cholera deaths; 3,000 confirmed 
cases and 10,000 suspected cases in Iraq, including in Baghdad. 
Torunoglu complained that WHO reports are not timely nor 
sufficiently detailed.  He asked for U.S. Government assistance in 
obtaining more information from Iraq.

GOT Assistance to Iraq Slowed by MFA 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Torunoglu said the Health Ministry is working though its 
official government channels to offer assistance to Iraq.  He said 
the Ministry is ready to help now and that urgent action is needed 
to help contain the outbreak.  He expressed frustration with the 
time delays associated with official channels and asked whether the 
U.S. government might have a list of what items are urgently needed 
in Iraq.   He said the Ministry is ready to start stockpiling and 
moving goods to the border in advance of the official request from 
Iraq for assistance.  We understand the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) 
has begun to provide assistance to the Mosul area.  The Health 
Ministry's offer to join the TRC team was denied by the Turkish 
Foreign Ministry which is insisting on an official government to 
government agreement before action is taken. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Action:  Embassy would appreciate information from the 
Department that can be passed to the GOT about Iraq's specific 
assistance needs to contain cholera.  Embassy POC is Rebecca Neff. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment:  The Health Ministry is a professional and 
well-run agency that did a tremendous job during the Avian Influenza 
scare last year.  We believe they urgently want to help but are 
being slowed by bureaucracy and MFA policy toward Iraq.
