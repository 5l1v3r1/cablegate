PHILIPPINE VIEWS 
 
REF: STATE 9124 
 
¶1. (SBU) Political-External chief delivered Reftel demarche 
on Iran's nuclear program to the Department of Foreign 
Affairs (DFA).  The DFA was represented by Donna Rodriguez, 
Director of the Office of Political, Security, and Legal 
Matters in the international organizations bureau, and Rona 
Goce, Principal Assistant to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty Review Conference (NPT RevCon) Chair, Ambassador 
Libran Cabactulan.  Rodriguez replied that addressing Iran's 
nuclear program is an important issue for DFA because, among 
other reasons, the issue will surely be raised during the NPT 
RevCon in May.  She also pledged to present the demarche to 
Foreign Minister Romulo and convey his views to post. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a separate meeting, Americas Office Director 
Deena Amatong told Pol-Ext chief that Iran's nuclear program 
was high on the DFA's list of priorities.  She implied, but 
did not say explicitly, that her Government had raised the 
issue with Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki during his 
November 2009 visit to Manila.
