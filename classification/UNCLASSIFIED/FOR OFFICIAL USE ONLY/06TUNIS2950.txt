¶1. (U) This cable contains highlights of recent economic 
developments in Tunisia on the following topics: 
 
¶A. Tunisia to Increase Transit Capacity of Algerian Gas to Italy 
¶B. FDI Up Nearly Ten Percent in 2006 
¶C. Inflation Down in November 
 
------------------------------------ 
Tunisia to Increase Transit Capacity 
of Algerian Gas to Italy 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) On December 11, the GOT signed agreements with two Italian 
firms, World Energy and the Edison SpA, permitting transit of an 
increased volume of Algerian natural gas to Italy via Tunisia and 
outlining royalty payments to the GOT.  The Trans-Mediterranean 
Pipeline (also known as the Enrico Mattei gas pipeline) is a natural 
gas pipeline from Algeria via Tunisia to Sicily and onward to 
Italy's mainland.  The current capacity of pipeline is approximately 
27 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually.  In April, the GOT 
signed an agreement with Italian state-owned energy company Ente 
Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI) to expand the transport capacity to 
Italy.  By April 2008, a capacity of 3.2 billion cubic meters a year 
will be added; by October 2008 there will be an additional capacity 
of 3.3 billion cubic meters a year.  There are plans to expand the 
total pipeline capacity to 33.5 billion cubic meters by 2012. 
 
¶3. (U) The Tunisian section of the pipeline, which is 370 kilometers 
long, is owned by state-owned SOTUGAT (Societe Tunisienne du Gazoduc 
Trans-Tunisien).  According to the 2005 Central Bank report, 
royalties are assessed at a rate of 5.25 to 6.75 percent of the 
value of transported gas, which is paid in both cash and gas.  The 
cash value of gas royalties increased considerably in 2005, up from 
158 million USD in 2004 to 261 million USD in 2005. 
 
---------------------------------- 
FDI Up Nearly Ten Percent for 2006 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) According to the Foreign Investment Promotion Agency (FIPA), 
during the ten first months of 2006, foreign direct investment (FDI) 
increased 9.7 percent over the same period of 2005.  FDI by sector 
for the first ten months of 2006 shows energy as the leading 
investment sector (320.03 million USD), followed by manufacturing 
(247.07 million USD) and tourism (14.25 million USD).  Total FDI for 
this period is 683.67 million USD, excluding privatization receipts. 
 The GOT received 2.3 billion USD from the Emirati Tecom-DIG (Dubai 
Investment Group) for the March 2006 partial privatization of 
Tunisie Telecom (Ref B), representing the largest source of foreign 
capital for 2006. 
 
¶5. (U) According to FIPA, France is the top source of FDI with 87.6 
million USD, followed by Italy with 40.33 million USD.  The Bahamas, 
normally not among top investors in Tunisia, ranked third this year 
owing to a 31.61 million USD investment by a Bahamas-based 
subsidiary of American shoemaker EVOL to expand existing operations 
in Tunisia.  Investment attributed to the United States for the 
first 11 months of 2006 is only 2.8 million USD.  (Note: FIPA's 
country ranking excludes privatization, energy and portfolio 
investments.  End Note.) 
 
-------------------------- 
Inflation Down in November 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (U) According to data released by Tunisia's National Statistics 
Institute, year-on-year growth (November 2006/November 2005) in the 
national consumer price index (CPI) stood at 3.8 percent in 
November, down from 4.4 percent in October 2006.  Inflation fell 0.2 
percent in November after rising 0.3 percent in October.  The 
monthly decrease was attributed to a 1.1 percent decline in the cost 
 
TUNIS 00002950  002 OF 002 
 
 
of food, which accounts for 36.5 percent of the basket used in 
calculating the index.  Housing and the healthcare prices remained 
flat between October and November, while leisure, transport and 
clothing prices increased.  Inflation stood at 4.6 percent in the 
first eleven months of this year, sharply up from the 1.8 percent 
recorded a year earlier, owing partially to rising international oil 
prices (Ref A).
