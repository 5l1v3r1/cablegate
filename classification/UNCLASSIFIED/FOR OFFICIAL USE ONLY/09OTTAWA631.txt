¶1. (SBU) Canada supports U.S. leadership to make the Global 
Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) a durable 
international institution and welcomes the United Nations 
Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) as an official observer 
(ref a), according to Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade Senior Policy Advisor for 
Non-Proliferation David MacDuff.  He commented that his 
earlier critique of the GICNT nonetheless remains valid (ref 
c) and that it continues to be in "serious need of 
reinvigoration."  He confirmed that Canada welcomes UNODC's 
participation and hopes that this will increase GICNT's 
effectiveness.
