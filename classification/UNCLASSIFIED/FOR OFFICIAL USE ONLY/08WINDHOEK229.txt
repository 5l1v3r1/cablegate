¶1. (U) Acting DCM presented reftel points to MFA Permanent Secretary 
Veiccoh Nghiwete on Tuesday, July 29.  The meeting was cordial and 
Nghiwete made clear that the GRN hopes the negotiations in Zimbabwe 
will result in a unity government.  Nonetheless, he stressed that 
the GRN sees sanctions on Zimbabwean officials as counterproductive. 
 
 
¶2. (U) Permanent Secretary Nghiwete thanked the Acting DCM for 
informing him of the U.S. position.  He said the Namibian government 
adheres to the SADC and AU view that the participants in the 
negotiations must engage to find a solution that is amenable to all 
parties.  He went on to say that the MDC did not win the 51% 
necessary to be declared the winner outright in the March 29th vote. 
 He argued that one cannot throw the results of the second election 
out and simply declare Tsvangirai the president.  He asked what law 
would that be:  the "law of the jungle?"  The Acting DCM replied 
that the March vote was a clear indication of the Zimbabwean 
people's desire for change in their country.  However, the run-off, 
having been marred by violence, could not be an accurate measure of 
the people's view.  Now that the talks are taking place, the U.S. 
hopes they will result in a transitional government that reflects 
the will of the people and focuses on reform. 
 
¶3. (U) Nghiwete went on to say that the world community should give 
the negotiations in Zimbabwe a chance because, "We don't want to see 
another Kenya."  He argued the West should give the parties to the 
negotiations breathing room and that sanctions could undermine their 
progress.  He urged the U.S. to evaluate the history of its 
sanctions against Zimbabwe and whether they have resulted in any 
improvements for the people of that country.  The Acting DCM replied 
that the U.S. is very concerned with the plight of the Zimbabwean 
people and therefore has continued to provide humanitarian aid and 
has maintained its trade relationship with the country.  (Note:  The 
PS seemed genuinely surprised that the United States still had trade 
ties to Zimbabwe.  The Acting DCM explained that Zimbabwe had held a 
trade surplus until recently.  End Note.)  Nonetheless, we judge it 
is important to deny rewards to those individuals who commit 
atrocities or undermine democracy there.  He reminded the PS that 
the Zimbabwe government is not allowing NGOs to distribute food to 
the people.  The PS agreed that it has become a "very ugly 
situation," and hoped the negotiations would produce an immediate 
solution. 
 
¶4. (U) The PS urged the U.S. to press Tsvangirai to come to an 
agreement with ZANU-PF.  He said that while Namibia is a close 
friend to Zimbabwe, the GRN has limited influence over the 
situation.  He assessed that neither the MDC nor ZANU-PF could 
control the government in Zimbabwe, and a unity government had 
become necessary.   He said the people of Zimbabwe do not 
necessarily think a Tsvangirai-led government is the best outcome, 
and therefore an inclusive solution would be the ideal.  He went on 
to say it is important to continue encouraging the two sides to talk 
and he hopes the U.S. side will do the same.  He hoped that the 
current impasse between ZANU-PF and the MDC that has been reported 
in the press is only an indication of tough negotiating tactics and 
that the parties will rise above their conflicts in coming days.  He 
said he understood that Tsvangirai is negotiating from a position of 
power, but that Mugabe must secure ZANU-PF's position in a future 
government.
