REF: STATE 112828 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Post conveyed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA) reftel points regarding USG concerns about the 
Goldstone report released on September 15 and scheduled for 
discussion in the UN General Assembly starting November 4. 
MFA officials responsible for UN and International 
Organizations did not provide substantive feedback. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  Although the MFA has not informed post of 
its views regarding the Goldstone report, Nepal generally has 
reservations about human rights resolutions of any type. 
Nepal is struggling with its own human rights issues in the 
wake of a ten-year Maoist insurgency and a fragile, on-going 
peace process, and wants to avoid scrutiny of its human 
rights record.
