SUBJECT: CANADIAN ATTENDANCE AT SEPTEMBER 25 HAITI KEY 
PLAYERS MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 95352 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Canada expressed thanks for its inclusion in the 
September 25 Haiti Key Players Meeting in New York, according 
to Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
Haiti Task Force Director Denis Robert.  He noted that 
Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon will be in New York on 
September 25 and that Haiti "remains one of Canada's top 
foreign policy priorities," and predicted but could not yet 
formally confirm that the Foreign Minister would attend. 
Minister of State for the Americas Peter Kent will accompany 
Cannon to New York and would likely lead Canada's 
representation if FM Cannon does not attend the meeting, 
according to Robert. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Robert commented that the agenda "closely tracked 
with Canada's thinking" on discussion topics, and offered no 
suggestions for additions or deletions.  Robert called the 
invitations to Norway and Sweden as potential new donors for 
Haiti "an excellent idea."
