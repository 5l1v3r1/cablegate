(SBU)  The DCM discussed a possible Spanish contribution to 
the purchase of fully armed vehicles for the Multinational 
Forces and Observers (MFO) with Javier Sancho, Chief of Staff 
to Foreign Minister Moratinos, on July 2.  Sancho said that 
it sounded like a good idea and indicated he would ask DG for 
Middle East, Mediterranean, and Africa Alvaro Iranzo to look 
into funding possibilities.  Separately, Poloff contacted 
Deputy Director General for the Middle East Alberto Ucelay on 
July 2 to follow up.  Ucelay said that the Spanish were 
looking for money but were as yet unable to provide a funding 
source.  Poloff followed up again with Ucelay on July 13, and 
Ucelay confirmed that the Spanish supported a contribution 
but had not yet located funds.  He said he would contact 
Poloff when funds became available.  COMMENT: Given the 
proximity of the August vacation in Spain, it appears that 
Spain may not be able to produce a contribution prior to 
September.  We will continue to pursue the matter with our 
counterparts in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  END COMMENT.
