¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On June 12 German police arrested "Burhan B." at 
Frankfurt Airport and charged him with breaking German export laws 
and with membership and support for Ansar al-Islam.  Separately, on 
June 20 authorities launched the trial of Ata Abdoulaziz Rashid and 
two accomplices.  They stand accused of plotting to kill then-Iraqi 
Prime Minister Allawi during a visit to Germany in December 2004. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
Burhan B.: An Ansar al-Islam "Treasurer" 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) In a case crossing German state boundaries, 
Baden-Wuerttemberg Office of Criminal Investigation (LKA) officials 
arrested a 36-year old Iraqi citizen identified only as "Burhan B." 
at Frankfurt Airport June 12 while in transit from Zurich to Amman. 
Federal Prosecutor Monika Harms charged Burhan with breaking German 
export laws, providing financial and logistical support for Ansar 
al-Islam, and membership in a terrorist organization.  According to 
press reports, and confirmed by Frankfurt police, Burhan had been 
living in Switzerland for close to ten years and had just vacated 
his apartment before beginning his planned journey back to Iraq. 
Investigators accuse him of serving as a de facto treasurer for 
Ansar al-Islam in Germany.  Quoting information from a Swiss 
interior ministry report, the press also noted Burhan is alleged to 
have contacts with other extremists throughout Europe; Swiss police 
also apparently found numerous extremist propaganda materials during 
a search of his apartment in 2005.  German police accuse Burhan of 
collecting 22,000 Euros for the organization on behalf of Ata 
Abdoulaziz Rashid (see below). 
 
Ansar al-Islam Trial Begins 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Separately, the trial of Ata Abdoulaziz Rashid (allegedly 
the leader of Ansar al-Islam in Germany) and two accomplices, Rafik 
Mohamad Yousef and Mazen al-Hussein, began in Stuttgart on June 20. 
The three Iraqi men have been in German custody since December 3, 
2004, following their arrest for suspected involvement in a plot to 
kill former Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi during his visit to Germany. 
 The accused also face charges of conspiracy and membership in Ansar 
al-Islam.  All three individuals are included in the UNSCR 1267 
Committee Consolidated List of Individuals and Entities Associated 
with the Taliban, al-Qaida and Usama Bin Laden, subsequent to German 
proposals; therefore all are subject to arrest freeze and travel 
ban. 
 
¶4. (U) Post will continue to follow and report on further 
developments.  This message was coordinated with Embassy Berlin.
