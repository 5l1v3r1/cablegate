SUBJECT: OBSERVATIONS FROM EMBASSY STAFF: POLLING STATION 
OFFICIALS AND VOTERS MANAGE NICELY -- PROUD, COMPETENT, AND 
FAIR 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Forty-seven Embassy teams observed the 
July 27 elections in 18 provinces and found above-average 
professional behavior from the more than 15,000 PSCs (Polling 
Station Commissions) in the country.  PSC staff were 
generally seen as timely, competent, evenhanded, and 
impartial in their many duties and responsibilities 
(everything from checking voter identities to distinguishing 
between valid and invalid ballots at the end of the day). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy staff were also quick to note that the 
voting atmosphere was calm, if a bit chaotic among the many 
eager voters.  Polling stations were largely free of 
political propaganda and security was good.  Although 
problems remained in some districts and polling stations, the 
vast majority of Cambodians who went to vote and cast their 
ballot on election day came away with a sense of 
satisfaction.  End Summary. 
 
THE PSC: ALL IN A DAY'S WORK 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Observation teams were pleasantly surprised by the 
level of collegiality and pride polling station workers 
displayed as they tried their best to ensure the integrity of 
the democratic process.  Although not representative of all 
election officials, a majority of PSCs demonstrated great 
dedication to their work.  One American observer recounted 
the story of how polling station workers placed particular 
care in helping one elderly lady through each step of the 
voting process in Takeo province.  Not only were the polling 
officials patient with the elderly voter who had impaired 
vision and hearing, but they also averted their eyes from the 
lady,s ballot as she mistakenly revealed her ballot after 
voting in the booth. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Another observation team on the opposite side of the 
country in the province of Banteay Meanchey witnessed the 
high level of organization and communication between the PSC 
and the CEC (Commune Election Commission) as officials 
collaborated to help one voter successfully find her correct 
polling station.  Much like the rural provincial 
observations, Embassy staff in Phnom Penh also noticed how 
the PSC maintained courteous and professional behavior 
throughout the long day. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Although they could not provide answers to voters 
failing to find their names on posted registration lists, the 
staff patiently explained where voters could look elsewhere 
and were generally calm and consoling in demeanor.  In fact, 
it is a testimony to polling site officials' professionalism 
that there were no reported incidents of unruly crowds 
related to this problem in Phnom Penh.  Although observers 
reported numerous dissatisfied would-be-voters congregating 
at some of the larger sites, trying to find their names on 
lists, officials' actions coupled with an apparent effort by 
voters themselves to maintain calm averted frictions. 
 
ALL QUIET ON THE RURAL FRONT 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Despite isolated and understandable cases of 
agitation expressed by upset voters, the atmosphere 
surrounding the 2008 National Parliamentary Elections this 
past weekend was peaceful both before and after preliminary 
results were publicized. 
 
¶7. (SBU) While most PSCs displayed restraint in showing any 
type of emotion, U.S. observers also found that polling 
station staff were not immune to a little light-hearted 
humor.  One observation team in the rural province of Kampong 
Speu noted that election officials and domestic observers had 
a good laugh during the ballot-counting process when one 
ballot was shown to have been marked by a large smiley face. 
After the laugh, the ballot was properly marked as invalid, 
as were other "protest ballots." 
 
¶8. (SBU) Most American observation teams noted how Cambodians 
were visibly excited about voting as soon as the polling 
stations were open and were visibly proud once they dipped 
their right index finger into the indelible ink as evidence 
of their participation.  Even more encouraging were the 
accounts of peaceful celebrations and reflections immediately 
after the preliminary results were televised from all parties 
of the political spectrum.  As of July 29, it seems that most 
rural Cambodians accepted either victory or defeat at the 
 
PHNOM PENH 00000626  002 OF 002 
 
 
polling station with a reserved demeanor. Time will tell if 
urban voters follow suit.
