This message is Sensitive But Unclassified. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Foreign Minister 
Peter MacKay will attend the 61st UNGA and be present for 
some of the General Debate.  It is also a possibility that 
Josee Verner, Minister for International Cooperation and 
Minister for La Francophonie and Official Languages Minister 
will participate.  The composition of the delegation has yet 
to be confirmed.  Currently, there is no indication that the 
Canadians will request any appointments with senior USG 
officials, although the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT) is currently working with the 
Prime Minister's Office to finalize those decisions. 
Director General for International Organizations Ferry de 
Kerkhove will accompany the Foreign Minister; Governor 
General Michaelle Jean, head of state, is not expected to 
attend. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The Prime Minister is currently scheduled to 
arrive in New York on the afternoon of September 20, speak to 
the Assembly at noon on September 21 and depart that 
afternoon.  Current plans do not envision that Mrs. Harper 
will accompanying him.  Foreign Minister MacKay is expected 
to be in New York from September 18 through 23, although 
there is a possibility that his stay could be shortened. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  It is likely that four to six opposition Members 
of Parliament (MP) will travel with the ministers.  When 
Parliament is in session (NOTE:  Parliament returns on 
September 18.  END NOTE), it is required that two MPs 
accompany each minister who travels.  The decisions could, 
however, come at the last minute, owing to the fact that the 
opposition parties themselves must agree to send their MPs 
and identify which ones will go. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Post will send additional information as it becomes 
available.
