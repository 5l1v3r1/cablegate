(SBU)  On March 6, AIT Econoff delivered demarche per reftel 
s\IZWJ: Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) stated 
BOFT is aware of the issue, and it is clearly in the interest 
of Taiwan's industry for these products to receive duty-free 
treatment.  He continued, however, that Chinese Taipei was 
"not yet ready" to support the U.S. proposal, preferring to 
wait for guidance from the World Customs Organization (WCO) 
on classification of many of these products.  Many of these 
products, he noted, did not exist when the ITA was signed and 
it would be best for the WCO to develop a comprehensive, 
worldwide approach to the issue.
