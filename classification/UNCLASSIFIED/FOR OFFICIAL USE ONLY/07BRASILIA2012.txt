¶2.  (SBU) SCICOUNS delivered reftel points on October 11 October to 
Government of Brazil (GOB) Ministry of Exterior Relations (MRE) 
Director for Space, Marine and Antarctic Affairs, Counselor Bernardo 
Velloso, and his assistant for fisheries matters, Third Secretary 
Ronaldo Lima Vieira.  These MRE officials were interested in the 
U.S. proposals. The GOB looks forward to receiving more details at 
the October 22 to November 2 Commission for the Conservation of 
Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) meeting in Hobart, 
Australia.  While generally favorable towards the two U.S. proposals 
in reftel, Velloso said the GOB would need to see the details before 
making any definitive decisions. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On bottom fishing, Velloso stated that the GOB already had 
measures against drift nets and so he "supposed Brazil will be 
favorable" to the proposal at CCAMLR, especially with regards to 
protecting sensitive areas.  With respect to a performance review of 
CCAMLR in an effort to strengthen it, Velloso indicated that GOB was 
supportive of strengthening CCAMLR.  He was concerned, however, 
about financial contributions to CCAMLR, a problem which has to be 
dealt with.  CCAMLR needs to address the "free rider" problem.  It 
is fundamental that CCAMLR receive sufficient funding to carry out 
its tasks, so delinquent members should somehow be encouraged to pay 
their shares.  Nonetheless, he was opposed to imposing penalties or 
interest on late payments. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In addition, Velloso was interested in CCAMLR possibly 
taking on illegal unreported and unregulated fisheries.  He 
understood that Australia and the EU had a proposal on this.  He 
wanted these fisheries dealt with through international efforts, but 
not through any unilateral actions. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The Brazilian delegation will consist of Professor Edith 
Fanta, who is the current Chair of the CCAMLR Science Committee, and 
Mr. Felipe Hees from the Brazilian Embassy in Canberra.
