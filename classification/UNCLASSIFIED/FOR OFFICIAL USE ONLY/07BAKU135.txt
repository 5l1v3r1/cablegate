SUBJECT: BLANKET OVERFLIGHT GRANTED BY AZERBAIJAN UNTIL THE 
END OF 2007 FOR OEF AND OIF FLIGHTS 
 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU)  The Government of Azerbaijan has extended for one 
year blanket diplomatic overflight clearance for all US 
Government and contract flights in support of Operation 
Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi 
Freedom (OIF) in Iraq.  The GOAJ renewed this important 
support for the war against terror in a diplomatic note dated 
January 16, 2007.  From both a political and an operational 
point of view, the GOAJ,s continued blanket overflight 
clearance is extremely important.  In 2006, there were 561 
planes which passed through Azerbaijani air space and 175 
planes which required overflight and landing permission in 
Azerbajian, in support of OEF and OIF.
