ANTICAMCORDING BILL 
 
REF: A. MONTREAL 58 
 
     ¶B. 06 MONTREAL 436 
     ¶C. 06 MONTREAL 365 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: Minister of Heritage Bev Oda and Minister of 
Industry Maxime Bernier on June 1 introduced legislation to 
amend Canada's Criminal Code to make the act of recording a 
movie in a theater without consent a criminal act.  The bill 
has been praised by U.S. and Canadian Industry, is supported 
by all opposition parties, and may be passed by Parliament 
before the summer recess later this month.  If passed, the 
bill will immediately become law and will address a key USG 
concern about IPR protection in Canada.  Minister Oda 
explained that this legislation is the first step in 
strengthening Canadian protection of IPR and that the 
Government is working on addition IPR related legislation. 
End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On Friday, June 1 Ministers Oda and Bernier announced 
the introduction of legislation to criminalize the 
unauthorized recording of a movie in a Canadian theater.  The 
announcement was made with much fanfare to members of the 
media and industry representatives.  The industry presence 
was particularly felt as Cineplex -- a major Canadian movie 
theater chain -- decorated the room in Parliament Hall with 
movie posters and concession stands and provided popcorn to 
all attendees including Emboffs. 
 
¶3. (U) Minister Oda explained in her prepared remarks that 
this legislation is designed to help protect Canadian film 
producers and distributors.  She added that the camcording 
bill is the first step in improving IPR protection in Canada 
and that the Government is continuing to work on additional 
legislation to protect IPR, including the ratification of the 
WIPO internet treaties.  Several industry associations, 
including the Canadian Motion Picture Distributors 
Association and the Motion Picture Association of America, 
issued press releases praising the new legislation. 
 
¶4. (U) Responding to the press, Oda said somewhat 
disingenuously that the policy change had been in the works 
"for months" and claimed that U.S. pressure -- in the form of 
studio threats to delay releases of major films in Canada, 
Canada's designation on the Special 301 list, repeated 
Embassy approaches, and the May 30 visit of California 
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger who personally raised the 
camcording issue with Prime Minister Harper -- had nothing to 
do with the Government's decision to move forward with the 
bill at this time. 
 
¶5. (SBU) An Embassy contact in the Ministry of Justice said 
the Government has secured an informal agreement from all 
three opposition parties to "fast track" the camcording 
legislation through the House of Commons and is negotiating 
with a committee member in the Senate to obtain similar 
expedited passage through the Senate.  The Government is 
hopeful that the bill will pass before the summer recess. 
Once passed by Parliment and given royal assent, the bill 
will immediately become law. 
 
¶6. (U) The new legislation would result in up to two years 
jail time for unauthorized recording of a movie in a theater 
and up to five years jail time for unauthorized recording of 
a movie with the intent to commercial distribute. 
 
¶7. (U) Full text of the bill follows: 
 
"The Criminal Code is amended by adding the following after 
section 431.2: 
 
¶432. (1) A person who, without the consent of the theater 
manager, records in a movie theater a performance of 
Qmanager, records in a movie theater a performance of 
cinematographic work within the meaning of section 2 of the 
Copyright Act or its soundtrack 
(a) is guilty of an indictable offense and liable to 
imprisonment for a term of not more than two years; or 
(b) is guilty of an offense punishable on summary conviction. 
 
(2) A person who, without the consent of the theater manager, 
records in a movie theater a performance of cinematographic 
work within the meaning of section 2 of the Copyright Act or 
its soundtrack for the purpose of sale, rental or other 
commercial distribution of a copy of the cinematographic work 
(a) is guilty of an indictable offense and liable to 
imprisonment for a term of not more than five years; or 
(b) is guilty of an offense punishable on summary conviction 
 
OTTAWA 00001076  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
(3) In addition to any punishment that is imposed on a person 
who is convicted of an offense under this section, the court 
may order that anything that is used in the commission of the 
offense be forfeited to Her Majesty in right of the province 
in which the proceedings are taken.  Anything that is taken 
may be disposed of as the Attorney General directs. 
 
(4) No order may be made under subsection (3) in respect of 
anything that is the property of a person who is not party to 
the offense."
