SUBJECT: GUIDANCE REQUESTED: BRITS SEEK U.S. RESPONSE TO 
GOCR'S UNSC REFORM PROPOSAL 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST: The Costa Rican MFA 
issued a press release on March 10 highlighting a GOCR 
proposal for UNSC reform.  The MFA did not push anything new 
in terms of UNSC enlargement, its desire for greater access 
of non-permanent members, especially for small states, and 
its focus on Working Methods. However, the release noted that 
the GOCR proposal would require changing the UN Charter.  The 
British Embassy here asked for the U.S. position on March 25. 
 Post requests guidance for responding, including the 
Department's/USUN's view and other P5 views.  Please advise. 
END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U) The MFA reported that it had launched an "innovative 
proposal" that sought opportunities for UNSC representation 
among small and medium-sized states and could "unblock" 
reform discussions that have continued since the UN's 
creation.  The proposal's three fundamental principles were 
rotation, re-election (dependent on performance and 
accountability), and an ineligibility clause requiring UNSC 
members to sit out a double term before being re-elected.  On 
the final point, for example, a country that served one term 
and was not immediately re-elected would have to sit out at 
least twice the term's length before serving again.  The 
release indicates -- but is not entirely clear -- that a 
re-elected country would serve the second term, and then 
would be required to sit out for twice the length of the 
combined two terms, to ensure opportunities for rotation. 
GOCR recommends 3-year instead of two-year terms. 
 
¶3. (U) The GOCR expressed its "patent opposition" to 
extending permanent membership privileges of the P5 to other 
UN bodies.  It noted that it was against adding new permanent 
members to the UNSC unless the number of non-permanent 
members were to be extended beyond ten.  According to the 
MFA, the last sentence of Article 23.2 of the UN Charter 
would have to be modified to read:  "Retiring members will 
not be eligible (for re-election) at all for a period of 
double the term" (unofficial translation). Post will forward 
the release by email to USUN and IO/UNP. On March 25, the 
British Embassy asked about the U.S. response. 
 
¶4. (SBU) UNSC (and overall UN) reform remain an important 
objective of the Arias administration, so the content of this 
release -- consistent with what we have heard over recent 
months -- is not surprising.  The fact that it was issued 
with no fanfare is somewhat puzzling, but other recent 
foreign policy developments (e.g., recognition of Cuba, SICA 
frictions and VP Biden's visit) have pushed UN issues aside. 
Of note, despite their overall importance to the Arias 
administration, there was not a single mention of UN-related 
issues in the GOCR's proposed agenda for the bilateral 
meeting with the VP.  We will consult further with MFA and 
report anything newsworthy.
