COUNCIL DURING ITS MONTHLY MIDDLE EAST DEBATE ON MARCH 14, 
NEWLY-ARRIVED DPA U/SYG LYNN PASCOE (AMCIT) SAID DEVELOPMENTS 
OVER THE PAST MONTH -- INCLUDING THE MECCA AGREEMENT -- HOLD 
OUT THE PROMISE TO TURN PAST TRENDS ON THE 
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN FILE AROUND.  HE EXPRESSED HOPE THAT A 
PALESTINIAN NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT (NGU) WOULD DEMONSTRATE 
"RESPECT FOR SIGNED AGREEMENTS OF THE PLO, WHICH RENOUNCE 
TERRORISM, RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST IN PEACE AND 
SECURITY, AND IMPOSE CRUCIAL OBLIGATIONS ON THE PA."  WHIEL 
QATAR, SOUTH AFRICA, AND INDONESIA COMPLAINED ABOUT ASPECTS 
OF PASCOE'S BRIEFING, OTHER DELEGATIONS WELCOMED HIS 
PRESENTATION.  THE UK AND BELGIUM JOINED AMBASSADOR SANDERS 
IN ARGUING THAT A NUG SHOULD BE JUDGED BASED ON ITS 
ACCEPTANCE OF THE QUARTET PRINCIPLES.  ARGUING THAT THE MECCA 
AGREEMENT "OPENS UP A HISTORIC CHANCE FOR PROGRESS," RUSSIA 
PLEDGED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HAMAS AND CALLED FOR THE AID 
BOYCOTT AGAINST THE PA TO BE LIFTED.  OTHER DELEGATIONS USED 
MORE NUANCED LANGUAGE TO WELCOME EFFORTS TO FORGE A NUG, 
WHILE A FEW JOINED RUSSIA IN CALLING FOR A RESUMPTION OF AID 
TO THE PA.  SOUTH AFRICA COMPLAINED LOUDLY THAT THE 
 
 
 
PAGE 03 RUCNDTA0219 UNCLAS 
SECRETARIAT OUGHT TO CONSULT UNSC MEMBERS ON THE UN'S 
 
SIPDIS 
POSITIONS WITHIN THE QUARTET.  MOST DELEGATIONS LIMITED THEIR 
REMARKS ON LEBANON GIVEN THE UPCOMING CONSULTATIONS ON 
RESOLUTION 1701.  END SUMMARY. 
 
NEW U/SYG PASCOE DEBUTS IN COUNCIL 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) BRIEFING THE COUNCIL FOR THE FIRST TIME, 
RECENTLY-ARRIVED UNDER SECRETARY-GENERAL FOR POLITICAL 
AFFAIRS LYNN PASCOE SAID DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST OVER 
THE PAST MONTH -- AMONG THEM THE MECCA AGREEMENT AND THE 
RENEWAL OF ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN DIALOGUE -- HELD OUT THE 
PROMISE TO TURN PAST TRENDS AROUND.  HE EXPRESSED HOPE THAT 
THE NEW PALESTINIAN GOVERNMENT "WOULD TAKE POSITIONS AND 
ACTIONS THAT DEMONSTRATE, AS WAS AGREED IN MECCA, RESPECT FOR 
SIGNED AGREEMENTS OF THE PLO, WHICH RENOUNCE TERRORISM, 
RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST IN PEACE AND SECURITY, AND 
IMPOSE CRUCIAL OBLIGATIONNS ON THE PA."  REAFFIRMING THE 
QUARTET'S "WAIT AND SEE" APPROACH, PASCOE SAID THE BODY 
 
 
 
PAGE 04 RUCNDTA0219 UNCLAS 
REMAINS READY TO SUPPORT A GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO QUARTET 
PRINCIPLES.  HE CALLED ON THE PA TO IMPOSE LAW AND ORDER AND 
ACT AGAINST THOSE WHO ATTACK ISRAEL, COMMENDED ISRAEL'S 
CONTINUING RESTRAINT IN THE FACE OF QASSAM ROCKET FIRE, AND 
EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT IDF OPERATIONS IN NABLUS.  PASCOE 
REVIEWED THE RECENT UNESCO REPORT ON CONSTRUCTION NEAR THE 
TEMPLE MOUNT / HARAM AL-SHARIF AND NOTED CONTINUING 
CONSTRUCTION OF THE BARRIER IN THE WEST BANK AND LACK OF 
ACTION TO DISMANTLE SETTLEMENT OUTPOSTS.  DESCRIBING PROBLEMS 
WITH MOVEMENT AND ACCESS FOR BOTH PALESTINIANS AND UN WORKERS 
IN GAZA, PASCOE LAMENTED AS "UNSATISFACTORY" REPORTS THAT THE 
RAFAH TERMINAL WAS OPEN FOR ONLY 16 PERCENT OF SCHEDULED 
HOURS IN THE PAST MONTH. 
 
PASCOE'S BRIEFING: (UN)BALANCED? 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) AFTER THE QATARI REPRESENTATIVE BEGAN THE 
CONSULTATIONS BY STRONGLY IMPLYING THAT U/SYG PASCOE'S 
BRIEFING WAS NEITHER BALANCED NOR OBJECTIVE BECAUSE IT 
 
 
 
PAGE 05 RUCNDTA0219 UNCLAS 
"LACKED DETAILS OF ISRAELI VIOLATIONS," SEVERAL OTHER 
DELEGATIONS FELT COMPELLED TO EITHER DEFEND OR CRITICIZE THE 
U/SYG'S COMMENTS.  THE UK DPR COMMENDED PASCOE FOR A 
"BALANCED AND THOUGHTFUL" PRESENTATION AND SUGGESTED IT WAS 
NOT HELPFUL FOR SC MEMBERS TO CRITICIZE THE SECRETARIAT FOR 
PERFORMING ITS DUTIES.  RUSSIA SAID THE BRIEFING WAS A "VERY 
FULL ASSESSMENT."  ITALY EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT FOR PASCOE 
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE THROUGH HIM THAT MEMBERS OF THE UNSC 
COULD INFLUENCE THE EFFORTS OF THE QUARTET.  INDONESIA, 
HOWEVER, BEMOANED THE LACK OF DETAILS ABOUT IDF OPERATIONS IN 
NABLUS.  SOUTH AFRICAN PR KUMALO TOOK ISSUE WITH PASCOE'S 
REFERENCE TO A "BARRIER" IN THE WEST BANK, GIVEN THE 
INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE RULING THAT USED THE WORD 
"WALL."  (NOTE: THE ISRAELI MISSION TOLD USUN AFTER THE 
BRIEFING THAT IT WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY PASCOE REFERRED TO 
THE QUARTET PRINCIPLES AND THAT IT EXPRESSED ITS CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE BRIEFING TO SYG SPECIAL ADVISOR ON THE MIDDLE EAST 
MICHAEL WILLIAMS.  END NOTE.) 
 
CALLS TO ENGAGE NUG AND LIFT EMBARGO 
 
 
 
PAGE 06 RUCNDTA0219 UNCLAS 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) SEVERAL DELEGATIONS WELCOMED EFFORTS TO FORGE A 
PALESTINIAN NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT (NUG) AND A FEW CALLED 
ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO LIFT ITS EMBARGO ON AID TO 
THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY.  ARGUING THAT THE MECCA AGREEMENT 
 
 
"OPENS UP A HISTORIC CHANCE FOR PROGRESS," RUSSIA SAID IT 
RECOGNIZED ABU MAZEN AS THE NEGOTIATOR FOR ALL PALESTINIANS 
BUT WOULD ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HAMAS OFFICIALS.  THE 
 
 
 
PAGE 02 RUCNDTA0219 UNCLAS 
RUSSIAN DPR SAID HAMAS WAS READY TO "RESOLVE" THE ISSUE OF 
CAPTURED IDF SOLDIER GILAD SHALIT AS LONG AS THE ISSUE OF 
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS IN ISRAEL WAS ALSO ADDRESSED, AND HAD 
UNDERTAKEN TO CEASE QASSAM ROCKET FIRE IF ISRAEL "REFRAINED 
FROM ALL VIOLENCE."  THIS PROGRESS WAS "SUFFICIENT TO LIFT 
THE BLOCKADE ON THE PALESTINIANS."  PANAMA PRONOUNCED ITSELF 
"SATISFIED" WITH THE NUG.  QATAR EXPRESSED HOPE THE 
"BLOCKADE" WOULD BE LIFTED AND WARNED THAT "HISTORY WOULD NOT 
FORGIVE THOSE COUNTRIES" THAT IGNORE AN IMPENDING FAMINE IN 
THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. 
 
¶5. (SBU) DELIVERING REFTEL POINTS, AMBASSADOR SANDERS SAID 
THE USG WOULD JUDGE ANY NUG BASED ON ITS ACCEPTANCE OF THE 
QUARTET PRINCIPLES.  THE UK STRESSED ITS READINESS TO ENGAGE 
WITH AN NUG THAT "REFLECTED" THESE PRINCIPLES, WHILE BELGIUM 
SAID THE QUARTET PRINCIPLES ARE THE "LINCHPIN" ON WHICH TO 
RESUME ENGAGEMENT.  CALLING THE MECCA AGREEMENT A "HISTORICAL 
TURNING POINT," FRANCE SAID IT IMPLIES A RENUNCIATION OF 
VIOLENCE AND RECOGNITION OF ISRAEL.  ITALY WELCOMED THE NUG, 
WARNED AGAINST "UNFAIRLY NEGATIVE" ASSESSMENTS OF THE MECCA 
 
 
 
PAGE 03 RUCNDTA0219 UNCLAS 
AGREEMENT, ENCOURAGED THE PARTIES TO "MOVE CLOSER TO THE 
QUARTET PRINCIPLES," AND URGED OTHER UNSC MEMBERS TO 
DISREGARD STATEMENTS BY HAMAS OFFICIALS NOT IN THE PA AND NOT 
BECOME "HOSTAGE" TO SUCH NEGATIVITY.  GHANA SAID AN NUG 
SHOULD "COMMIT" TO QUARTET PRINCIPLES BUT THAT AID TO THE 
PALESTINIANS SHOULD BE RESUMED IMMEDIATELY.  PANAMA 
PRONOUNCED ITSELF "SATISFIED" WITH AN NUG.  INDONESIA AND 
CONGO BOTH CALLED FOR A LIFTING OF ALL AID RESTRICTIONS 
IMMEDIATELY. 
 
PRESSURE FOR COUNCIL ROLE IN QUARTET 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (U) ITALIAN PR SPATAFORA WELCOMED PASCOE'S COMMITMENT TO 
"RE-ENERGIZE" THE QUARTET, BUT ASKED HOW THIS COULD BE 
ACHIEVED.  KEYING OFF SPATAFORA'S COMMENTS, SOUTH AFRICAN PR 
KUMALO SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT HOW IF UNSC MEMBERS ARE 
REPRESENTED IN THE QUARTET BY THE UN, THEY SHOULD BE 
CONSULTED BEFORE AND AFTER QUARTET MEETINGS.  NOT ONLY HAD 
THE UNSC NEVER RECEIVED AN AGENDA FOR QUARTET DISCUSSIONS, 
 
 
 
PAGE 04 RUCNDTA0219 UNCLAS 
KUMALO COMPLAINED, IT HAD NEVER RECEIVED A READ-OUT FROM THE 
SECRETARIAT AFTERWARD NOR ANY INDICATION OF THE POINTS THE 
 
SIPDIS 
SYG WOULD RAISE DURING HIS UPCOMING TRIP TO THE ME. 
RESPONDING TO KUMALO AT THE END OF THE CONSULTATIONS, PASCOE 
SAID THE SECRETARIAT CAREFULLY LISTENS TO STATEMENTS MADE IN 
THE COUNCIL AND IS AVAILABLE TO TALK TO SC MEMBERS AT ALL 
TIMES.  HE URGED DELEGATIONS TO RAISE ANY ISSUES ABOUT THE 
SYG'S TRAVEL DURING THE SYG'S MONTHLY LUNCH WITH SYG MEMBERS. 
 
LEBANON: SOME CONCERNS ABOUT NEIGHBORS ROLE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) TURNING TO LEBANON, AMBASSADOR SANDERS CALLED FOR THE 
FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL UNSCRS 1559, 1680, AND 1701, 
EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE UNIIIC AND THE TIMELY ESTABLISHMENT 
OF A SPECIAL TRIBUNAL FOR LEBANON, AND CALLED ON IRAN AND 
SYRIA TO ABIDE BY THEIR COMMITMENTS UNDER RELEVANT UNSCRS. 
GIVEN THE UPCOMING UNSC CONSULTATIONS ON RESOLUTION 1701, 
MOST OTHER DELEGATES LIMITED THEIR COMMENTS ON LEBANON.  THE 
UK SECONDED THE CALL FOR THE EARLY CREATION OF A LEBANON 
 
 
 
PAGE 05 RUCNDTA0219 UNCLAS 
TRIBUNAL.  BELGIUM NOTED THAT ITS FOREIGN MINISTER HAD 
RECENTLY TRAVELED TO DAMASCUS TO URGE SYRIA TO COOPERATE WITH 
THE SC ON LEBANON.  ITALY EXPRESSED HOPE THAT THE RE-ARMING 
OF MILITIAS IN LEBANON WOULD STOP, AND CALLED FOR A 
COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL SOLUTION DEALING WITH THE TRIBUNAL 
AND CABINET FORMATION.
