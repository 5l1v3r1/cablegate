REF: SECSTATE 81015 
 
¶1. (SBU) We delivered the letter from AUSTR Barbara Weisel 
contained reftel to Gusmardi Bustami, Director General 
International Cooperation, at the Indonesian Ministry of 
Trade on August 7.  Bustami advised that he and his 
colleagues are continuing to study the proposals made by the 
U.S.  He plans to meet with his ASEAN colleagues in Bangkok 
on August 12 to discuss further these proposals and ASEAN's 
own five proposals.  Bustami advised that the government of 
Indonesia would provide USTR with a response to AUSTR 
Weisel's letter in the next few weeks following the Bangkok 
discussions. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bustami noted ASEAN members are currently 
establishing point persons for the proposals.  He said 
responses to the U.S. proposals from other ASEAN members have 
not been very positive thus far, but said that may reflect a 
focus on other immediate priorities.  He complained that 
Indonesia and Malaysia were finding it difficult to drive 
coordination on intra-ASEAN work, such as development of 
national single windows.  Bustami said he would be very 
interested in any additional detailed information that USTR 
could provide, particularly on the U.S. trade facitilation 
proposal, to help focus the upcoming discussions in Bangkok. 
He specifically raised the need for additional details 
regarding coverage of a trade facilitation agreement and 
institutions which would need to be involved in discussions 
in addition to Trade and Customs officials.
