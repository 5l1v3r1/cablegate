SUBJECT: TURKMENISTAN: IRAN'S RECENT CASPIAN-ENERGY RHETORIC 
 
¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) A number of international media outlets recently cited 
Reza Kasaeizadeh, Managing Director of the National Iranian Gas 
Export Company, as stating Iran would prevent Turkmenistan from 
participating in any projects aimed at transporting Turkmen gas via 
the Caspian Sea.  Although Kasaeizadeh's words cannot be considered 
an official government statement, they still reflect Iran's position 
on the issue of energy export routes from Central Asia.  The only 
westbound energy export routes from Central Asia that Iran does not 
oppose are routes that would run through its own territory.  Iran is 
extremely interested in becoming a transit country for gas exports, 
given Iran's current economic and political isolation.  Kasaeizadeh 
did not mention, however, how Iran would block trans-Caspian 
projects. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Theoretically, Iran could use the unsettled boundary 
status of the Caspian Sea as an excuse to impede a trans-Caspian 
pipeline project by insisting that no international projects should 
be implemented without the agreement of all littoral states.  Iran's 
position on the Caspian issue is that the Caspian seabed should be 
divided equally among the littoral states so that each country gets 
a 20% share.  This position is unacceptable to the rest of the 
littoral states and makes it difficult to foresee settlement of the 
Caspian delimitation issue in the near future.  Iran could also put 
economic pressure on Turkmenistan by stopping imports of Turkmen 
gas, cutting oil swap operations, and prohibiting transportation of 
Turkmenistan-bound goods across its territory.  Experts assert that 
potential economic losses that Turkmenistan would suffer from such 
measures would be significantly lower than the economic benefits 
that Turkmenistan would reap from a trans-Caspian pipeline. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Recent Iranian statements regarding its ability 
to prevent Turkmenistan from pursuing Caspian projects seem to be 
just that...empty statements.  In January 2008, Turkmenistan cut gas 
supplies to Iran, citing technical difficulties.  Iran reportedly 
tried to strong-arm Turkmenistan into resuming supplies but ended up 
paying the Turkmen more for gas.  As a result, experts believe that 
Iran's influence over Turkmenistan, especially when it comes to 
energy issues, is still very limited.  END COMMENT.
