SUBJECT: SANT'EGIDIO ON ZIMBABWE 
 
REF: MAPUTO 000652 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Community of Sant'Egidio point person on mediation 
and international relations, Dr. Claudio Betti, confirmed that 
--if asked-- Sant'Egidio is available to promote peaceful change 
in Zimbabwe.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a meeting with poloff on July 25, Betti 
reiterated an offer made by Sant'Egidio's President Marco 
Impagliazzo in Maputo, reported in reftel, to reach out to 
President Mugabe.  Members of Sant'Egidio in Rome know President 
Mugabe personally and could --if asked-- relay messages to him 
regarding possible solutions to the situation in his country. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Betti stated that Sant'Egidio, which is comprised of 
an international network of some 60,000 volunteers in 70 nations 
working on conflict resolution and charitable projects and which 
successfully mediated the 1992 peace agreement between warring 
factions in Mozambique, did not have a plan for Zimbabwe and 
would only step in to facilitate a dialogue if requested by the 
USG.  Betti said that such an initiative would be carried out by 
Rome-based Italian members of the Community, rather than by 
local volunteers.  He added that Sant'Egidio does not have a 
relationship with Zimbabwe's opposition. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  While Betti was not optimistic about the 
prospects of Mugabe relinquishing power, he confirmed 
Sant'Egidio's willingness to seek peaceful change in Zimbabwe. 
In order not interfere with other strategies to produce change, 
however, Sant'Egidio is unlikely to undertake any new initiative 
at this time unless the USG supports it.  End comment.
