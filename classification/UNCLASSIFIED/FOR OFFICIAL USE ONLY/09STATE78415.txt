SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO ONTARIO POWER GENERATION REGARDING A 
USG REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL FOR HELIUM-3 EXTRACTION 
 
REF: A. TORONTO 000163 
     ¶B. STATE 075002 
     ¶C. OTTAWA 000522 
     ¶D. STATE 69767 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request for Consulate General 
Toronto and Embassy Ottawa. Please see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) BACKGROUND: Per REF A, Ontario Power Generation 
(OPG) is "highly supportive" of the United States' proposal 
to extract helium-3 (He-3) from OPG facilities and has 
offered several suggestions and preferences. OPG stated it 
would like to transfer its inventory of tritium directly to 
the United States Government (USG) without being involved in 
any subsequent processes to utilize the tritium or its 
byproducts. OPG specifically requested the USG issue a 
Request for Proposal which would allow OPG to initiate a 
dialogue with the goal of a mutually-acceptable agreement and 
transfer of material. Additionally, OPG preferred an initial 
meeting consist of "people who can talk business and 
decision-makers," prior to technical discussions between 
technical experts. Mario Cornacchia, OPG's Director of 
Commercial Services, offered an informal tour of OPG's 
facility in Darlington and promised to consider including 
technical experts in any initial discussions. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: ConGen Toronto is requested to 
inform OPG that Washington is encouraged by their response 
and intends to draft a Request for Proposal to be delivered 
in the August 10 timeframe. Additionally, Washington requests 
that ConGen Toronto seek answers to the questions in 
paragraph 4 in order to facilitate a means to extract He-3 
from OPG stocks of tritium.  Washington requests that Embassy 
Ottawa inform appropriate Canadian authorities that OPG has 
expressed an interest in transferring its inventory of 
tritium to the United States Government, in contrast to the 
contemplated extraction of He-3 discussed in REF C. 
 
¶4. (SBU) FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS: 
 
--The tentative delegation listed in REF B would like to 
visit OPG's Darlington facility between September 9-17, 2009. 
Washington appreciates the offer of an informal tour and 
OPG's flexibility on the inclusion of at least one technical 
expert on this initial visit. 
 
--In order to generate a proper Request for Proposal, 
Washington asks that OPG provide information regarding any 
monitoring requirements that are associated with the 
cylinders described in REF A, and Canadian transport and 
packaging requirements for shipping these cylinders through 
Canadian territory. 
 
¶5. (SBU) REPORTING DEADLINE:  Washington requests that ConGen 
Toronto respond via front-channel cable no later than August 
3, 2009. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Washington appreciates Posts' assistance.  Contact 
Michael Curry (currymr@state.gov), 202-736-7692 in ISN/WMDT 
for additional information.
