¶1. (SBU) Mr. Sule Sella, Acting Head of the Multilateral 
Affairs Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), 
told PolOff May 3 "to my knowledge Tanzania has not made any 
official objection to Zimbabwe's Chairmanship of the 
Commission on Sustainable Development."  He noted that 
Tanzania normally tries to solve issues such as the UNCSD 
chairmanship within regional blocs, whenever possible, and 
not to exert influence outside of those fora. 
 
¶2. (SBU) PolOff stressed that while the U.S. supports the 
right of each region to choose its own candidate, the UNCSD 
Chair needs to be led by a representative who will further 
the goals of the organization which include land and 
agriculture policy reform.  In particular, the U.S. is 
looking to Tanzania to use its influence within the Africa 
Group to find an acceptable alternative to Zimbabwe's 
candidacy.  Sella agreed to discuss the issue both in MFA and 
with Tanzania's UN Mission in New York, saying, "I will check 
the temperature of my colleagues here and in New York."  Post 
will follow-up for MFA's response the week of May 7 with 
Ambassador Begum Taj, Head of the Multilateral Division, who 
is on official travel outside the country until May 5.
