¶1.  (SBU) As of July 29, the GOE reports 17 fatalities from AH1N1 
flu in Ecuador, with a total of 534 confirmed cases.  However, as 
many influenza cases go unreported, the real number of AH1N1 cases 
is probably much higher. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On July 23, in a widely broadcast interview with the 
popular Radio Sonorama, President Correa praised the actions of the 
Ministry of Health (MOH) and said that Ecuador had a low level of 
AH1N1 cases compared to other countries in the region.  He also 
urged Ecuadorians not to travel to countries with a "high level of 
incidence" of the virus, such as the U.S., Mexico, and Argentina. 
So far there has been very little reporting in the press about 
Correa's comments. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In response to ref A, this cable details the actions the 
GOE has implemented in response to AH1N1 flu and the dates each 
intervention was imposed.  Some of the interventions were reported 
in ref B. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The following public health interventions were instituted 
by the GOE as a part of its AH1N1 Flu Containment Strategy in place 
since April 2009: 
 
--On April 28, the MOH warned citizens and visitors to take standard 
flu season precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. 
 
--Quarantine policies were first announced on April 24. 
 
--An Emergency Declaration was first issued on April 29, when 
President Correa issued Decree 1693.  This declared a "state of 
emergency" due to the rapid propagation of the virus and its harmful 
effects on human health. 
 
--On May 15, the GOE ordered the first quarantine for a household 
where an infection was identified.  Quarantine was ordered for the 
first case identified in Guayaquil and for subsequent cases. 
 
--The first school closure also occurred on May 15 in Guayaquil. 
Many other schools have subsequently been closed, but shortly 
thereafter returned to normal activities.  Most schools in the 
central Sierra region have closed for summer vacations until 
mid-August. 
 
--The first theater was closed on July 22.  There have been 
additional closures, but most theaters remain open for business and 
some large concerts have taken place. 
 
--On July 28, the MOH issued new emergency regulations that give it 
expanded authority to postpone or cancel any public event. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Before and after the first case of AH1N1 flu was confirmed 
in Ecuador, the MOH has followed the World Health Organization's 
guidance in order to strengthen its surveillance and response system 
and prevent the rapid spread of the virus.  The MOH has ordered 
private and public health providers to report and closely monitor 
respiratory and influenza cases.  When AH1N1 cases are identified, 
they must be referred to the two reference hospitals in Ecuador for 
appropriate AH1N1 tests and treatments.  As several recent AH1N1 
deaths in Ecuador have indicated, however, these instructions have 
not always been followed by small medical clinics (ref B). 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Since the first case of AH1N1 flu was confirmed, the GOE 
has launched national press, TV, and radio awareness campaigns.  It 
has also begun direct training of public health providers and school 
teachers.  Airport and seaport controls have been established, with 
officials using thermal imaging equipment to screen passengers at 
the Guayaquil and Quito international airports.  Ecuador has 
purchased 220,000 doses of Tamiflu and personal protection equipment 
for public health providers.  In addition, the GOE has reserved 
550,000 doses of a future vaccine against AH1N1.
