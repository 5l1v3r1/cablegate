Public contact number for Public Safety and Emergency 
Preparedness Canada (PSEPC) 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶1.  The contact number for Canadians wishing to contribute to 
Katrina relief is 1-800-O CANADA (1-800-622-6232). 
Information on how to help is also available on the web sites 
of Foreign Affairs Canada, International Trade Canada (for 
companies wishing to sell to the US market) and the Canadian 
Red Cross and other NGOs. 
 
Other contact information for PSEPC is for USG use only, not 
for public distribution. 
 
Caution on food aid 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.  FAS raised a concern about the possibility that food 
included in emergency relief shipments from Canada would not 
be in compliance with our import regulations.  Post raised 
the issue with Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness 
Canada, which was not aware of food aid, but would note that 
potential shipments should be cleared with the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency.  FAS noted that even MREs could be a 
problem if they contain inadmissable Canadian beef products. 
 
More spaces for students 
------------------------ 
 
¶3.  According to press reports, the Premier of Prince Edward 
Island announce that there will be spaces at the provincially 
operated university and college to students at three New 
Orleans universities. 
 
In Nova Scotia, Acadia University (ref A) and three Halifax 
universities -  Saint Mary's, Mount Saint Vincent and 
Dalhousie - are offering to help students affected by the 
hurricane.  Financial and housing assistance varies according 
to the school.
