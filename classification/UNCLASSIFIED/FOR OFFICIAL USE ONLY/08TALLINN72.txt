REF: STATE 14840 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On February 14, Poloff met with Simmu Tiik, 
Director General of the 3rd Political Department (Russia) 
and Toomas Tirs, Georgia Desk Officer, at the Estonian MFA 
to discuss reftel points.  Tiik said, based on recent 
statements by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavarov, he 
does not think Russia will recognize Abkhazia in the short 
term.  Tiik hypothesized that the GOR might instead 
encourage Abkhazia to declare independence and then Russia 
would take certain steps toward de facto recognition.  In 
fact, Tiik pointed out, Russia already has extended 
diplomatic protocol to Abkhazian officials visiting Moscow 
and applies different border regimes to Abkhazia and the 
rest of Georgia.  Enhancing these existing policies would 
constitute a de facto recognition.
