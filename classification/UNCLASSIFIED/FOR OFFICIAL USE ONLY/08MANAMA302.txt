¶1.  (U) Embassy Manama maintains regular contact with 
democracy and human rights activists and NGOs in Bahrain, and 
encourages leaders in government and in opposition to persist 
in the revival of parliamentary politics and other reforms 
that King Hamad launched in 2002.  To the best of our 
knowledge, there are no active third country dissidents 
exiled to or receiving asylum in Bahrain. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Since our last report on democratization outreach 
(ref B), Emboffs maintained frequent contact with individual 
oppositionists and activists.  Group meetings included a 
February, 2008 roundtable discussion for civil society 
activists, hosted by Ambassador; DCM hosted a roundtable 
meeting with leaders of opposition parties.  Embassy 
highlighted publicly the liberalizing reforms associated with 
the FTA; for example, on April 8, Bahrain TV aired an 
interview with Ambassador on the topic.  Embassy Manama 
regularly meets with members of parliament and activists from 
all legal parties, except for several Sunni Islamist 
politicians who decline meetings with USG officials as a 
matter of policy.  Post is also in contact with several 
groups that are not in compliance with Bahrain's laws on the 
registration of political groups; these include Nabeel Rajab 
of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, and Mohammed 
Almaskati of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights. 
Sheikh Ali Salman, the leader of the largest Sh 
i'a party in parliament is one of the Embassy's most 
important contacts.  Ambassador last met with Ali Salman 
April 30. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The National Democratic Institute (NDI) and Bahrain 
Institute for Political Development (BIPD) signed an MOU in 
July that allowed NDI to resume work in Bahrain.  NDI has 
since returned repeatedly to conduct parliamentary training. 
The next session is scheduled for the end of May.  NDI has 
told the embassy privately that it is satisfied with the 
level of cooperation received from BIPD and that it believes 
the arrangement is working well. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Embassy Manama supports a robust array of MEPI 
programs.  In ref B, post described the MEPI grant to the 
Bahrain Human Rights Society that allowed it to publish its 
own human rights report.  That report will be released at the 
end of May.  The Bahrain Women's Union signed a contract with 
MEPI in which it agreed to partner with the Institute of 
International Education's West Coast Center in order to 
implement the Women in Technology program.  Freedom House, 
operating under a MEPI grant, recently signed an MOU allowing 
it to open a research office in Bahrain to facilitate its 
advocacy of a new family law.  Embassy Manama anticipates 
that MEPI will award four additional small grants in Bahrain 
to improve the legal framework for the environment, address 
domestic violence, increase awareness of trafficking in 
persons, facilitate youth advocacy, and build capacity within 
civil society. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Starting in November, 2007, post's Public Diplomacy 
section persuaded a leading Arabic-language newspaper to run 
monthly columns by Ambassador Ereli in which he highlighted 
U.S. views on political reform, among other issues.  As part 
of post's outreach to Bahrain's Shi'a, Ambassador and emboffs 
attended Ashura commemorations in central Manama in January, 
¶2008. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Since last year's response, Bahrain has experienced 
recurrent small street clashes between Shi'a youth and 
security forces.  Some of those arrested and charged in 
connection with riots in December 2007 have alleged 
mistreatment at the hands of the police.  Emboffs have 
maintained regular contact with the lead defense attorney for 
the detainees, with prosecutors, and with NGOs that monitor 
and report on the case.
