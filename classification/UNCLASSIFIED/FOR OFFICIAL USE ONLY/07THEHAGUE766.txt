¶1.  (SBU)  In response to reftel points, Carl Peersman, Legal 
Counsel, Legal Affairs Department, Dutch Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, told EconCouns on April 23 that the GONL will 
support a USG motion to table at the May 14-15 annual meeting 
of the International Commission for the International Tracing 
Service (ICITS) a proposal on advance technical distribution 
of electronic data to national repository institutions, for 
technical purposes, of International Tracing Service (ITS) 
archival collections as they become available and ahead of 
final ratification by all ICITS members of the protocols 
amending the 1955 Bonn Accords.  As the proposed transfer 
would not involve providing researchers or other members of 
the public with access to the records, Peersman said the GONL 
agreed that such a proposal was fully consistent with the 
original Bonn Accords and the recently concluded protocols 
providing for the opening of the ITS archives, located in Bad 
Arolsen, Germany, for the purpose of research and the 
provision of copies of archival material to ICITS member 
states. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On March 5, the GONL ratified the protocols 
amending the Bonn Accords and notified Germany, as the 
depository, of its completion of its internal approval 
process.  Peersman noted that he had shared this information 
and GONL support of the USG proposal with EUR/OHI Deputy 
Director Elizabeth Nakian.  He said the GONL welcomed USG 
participation in the May ICITS meeting.  EconCouns 
coordinated Post's approach to the GONL with Birgit Frie, 
Legal Advisor at the German Embassy in the Netherlands.
