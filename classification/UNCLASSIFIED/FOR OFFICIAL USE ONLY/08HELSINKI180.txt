SUBJECT: FINNISH COMMENTS ON THE APRIL 28-29 GAERC 
 
 
¶1. (U) Poloffs delivered GAERC talking points to Finnish 
MFA European Correspondent Leena-Kaisa Mikkola April 22. 
 
¶2. (SBU) WESTERN BALKANS:  The GoF agrees that the US and 
the EU should work collaboratively to urge the UNSG to 
show leadership in ensuring a smooth transition from UNMIK 
to a new international presence in Kosovo.  This 
especially is important in the face of Russian and Serbian 
pressure aimed at slowing the process.  However, Mikkola 
lamented, the EU remains unable to agree on a common 
position.  Member States that have not recognized Kosovo's 
independence are equally reticent about pressing the UNSG 
on post-UNMIK transition; only Spain has shown a hint of 
interest, and even then "there is not much movement there 
either," she said.  The Finns do not expect strong 
conclusions on the issue to emerge from the April GAERC. 
The Ministers may take some steps forward on visa waiver 
questions, a move the GoF supports if Serbia continues to 
show progress on the pre-established benchmarks. 
 
¶2. (SBU) ZIMBABWE:  The GoF does expect the Ministers to 
adopt strong conclusions condemning the delayed in release 
of election results and calling on key regional actors to 
step up pressure on the Mugabe government. 
 
¶3. (SBU) BURMA:  Although consensus does not exist, the 
GoF expects a fruitful preliminary discussion regarding 
the possibility of new sanctions and their potential 
efficacy.
