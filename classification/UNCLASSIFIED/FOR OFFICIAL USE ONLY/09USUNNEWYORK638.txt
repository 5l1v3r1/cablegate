 SUMMARY 
--------- 
 
¶1. (U) USUN PolCouns attended a June 22 meeting of the 
Friends of the Alliance of Civilizations (AOC) as an 
Observer.  The meeting, co-chaired by the Permanent 
Representatives of Turkey and Spain, provided a briefing on 
the Second Forum of the AOC, held in Istanbul on April 6-7, 
2009, and focused on two action items -- adoption of a draft 
resolution by the General Assembly in the fall, and the need 
for contributions to the AOC trust fund.  Several delegations 
mentioned their development of National Plans and Regional 
Strategies. Upcoming events of the Friends of the AOC include 
a Ministerial Meeting in September in New York, an Italian 
side event on "inter-ethnic" cities in September in NY, a 
Portuguese side event on youth in October in NY, and the next 
Forums in Brazil in 2010, Qatar in 2011 and Austria in 2012. 
End summary. 
 
ISTANBUL FORUM FOLLOW UP 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) AOC High Representative Jorge Sampaio, former 
President of Portugal, in a video-taped message, stressed the 
need to consolidate the gains of the AOC, naming four main 
achievements: 1-enlargement of the Group of Friends to over 
100 members; 2-networks of partnerships with civil society, 
foundations, private sector and international and regional 
organizations; 3-putting the AOC on the "international 
community's agenda as the UN's platform addressing good 
governance of cultural diversity", and 
4-promotion/development of concrete projects on the ground. 
including   (Comment: The phrase "good governance of cultural 
diversity" remains undefined. Other delegations mentioned 
during discussions on the margins of the meeting the need to 
clarify the precise meaning of the term.) 
 
¶3. (U) Sampaio reaffirmed that the four fields of action for 
the AOC are education, youth, migration and media, and urged 
the Friends to develop and implement National Plans and 
Regional Strategies for Intercultural Dialogue.  He wants to 
see the AOC acknowledged as a "full-ranked organization" 
within the UN, and proposed a resolution in the General 
Assembly plenary, under the Culture of Peace agenda item, 
that would recognize the AOC's status and raise its profile. 
On budget issues, Sampaio mentioned that the AOC budget of 
USD 2 million and staff of 10 people was insufficient in 
light of their growing membership, and encouraged broadening 
the voluntary donor base beyond the 4 or 5 existing donors to 
improve the AOC's cashflow. 
 
¶4. (U) Three countries have joined the AOC since the Istanbul 
Forum -- Paraguay, Lebanon and Belarus, bringing the total to 
¶103.  The Director of the AOC office, Marc Scheuer, noted the 
presence of the United States as an observer. (Comment: There 
are no other "observers" to the Group of Friends.) 
 
RESPONSES 
--------- 
 
¶5. (U) Some two dozen countries took the floor to express 
their support for the AOC, with most expressing support for 
an UNGA resolution but noting that further discussion on the 
precise language was needed.  Russia and Kazakhstan noted 
they were working on a National Action Plan, while Algeria, 
Indonesia, Luxembourg and Slovenia mentioned such Plans, and 
Egypt urged that a regional strategy be developed for the 
"EuroMed" region.  Pakistan's remarks on the discrimination, 
marginalization, humiliation and disrespect for Islam echoed 
the sentiments they espouse in discussions of religious 
intolerance in Durban, Third Committee and other human rights 
fora.  The Pakistani Perm Rep was, however, the only speaker 
to take such a negative tone.  Most remarks were 
congratulatory of the Istanbul Forum and the AOC's goals of 
cross-cultural understanding, but light on substance. 
 
¶6. (U) Italy announced a ranking official from their Foreign 
Ministry would co-host an event with AOC High Representative 
 
Sampaio and the International Organization of Migration (IOM) 
on September 28 on the margins of the UNGA ministerial week, 
entitled "the inter-ethnic city", dealing with issues of 
urban planning to foster inclusion of minority and migrant 
populations in cities.  They have extended an invitation to 
Mayor Bloomberg of New York City.  Portugal announced they 
would host a side event on youth in the context of the 
General Assembly's Third Committee.  Austria noted they would 
hold a symposium in Vienna on 29-30 June on Muslim youth in 
Europe, political participation and identity issues. IOM 
invited submissions to a contest they are holding for 
youth-made videos on migration and diversity, whose winner 
will be announced on International Migration Day, December 
18, 2009.  The Perm Rep of Brazil invited the Friends to 
"save the date" and attend the next Forum on May 28-29, 2010 
in Rio, where they hope to have over 1000 attendees. 
 
¶7. (U) The Council of Europe discussed their "flagship" 
projects on the teaching of history and on youth "peace 
camps" which could be coordinated with activities of the AOC, 
and noted that the Council had joined "without hesitation" an 
AOC initiative called "Restore Trust" on relations between 
Muslims and European society. Algeria suggested the 
appointment of civil society personalities to be Good Will 
Representatives for the AOC.  Indonesia joined others in 
supporting dialogue and understanding, adding that terrorist 
was inconsistent with human nature.  Argentina asked that 
high level meetings be limited to times of urgent need, while 
Focal Points could meet more often, both regionally as as a 
whole.  Argentina plans to present a trans-regional 
"Ibero-America" initiative next year.  Canada stated they 
were eager to be more active, and that the Americas had 
experience to offer on cross-cultural approaches. 
 
BUDGET CONCERNS 
--------------- 
 
¶8. (U) AOC Director Marc Scheuer brought attention to the 
cash flow problems of the AOC, noting that although they were 
seeking contributions from foundations, corporations and 
individuals, the bulk of the voluntary funding for the USD 
3.3 million budget would need to come from member states. 
Currently there is a shortfall of over $1 million.  He 
singled out four projects in particular that need dedicated 
funding: expansion of the media mechanism, fellowship, youth 
solidarity and a Dialogue Cafe.  Scheuer thanked Luxembourg, 
Egypt, Korea, Switzerland, UK and Denmark for the 
contributions they had made in response to the 
Secretary-General's letter in early May solicitiing funds. 
Spain, Brazil and Tunisia announced they would contribute to 
the Trust Fund. Algeria is considering a contribution and 
Afghanistan said they would make a "symbolic" contribution to 
the Trust Fund.
