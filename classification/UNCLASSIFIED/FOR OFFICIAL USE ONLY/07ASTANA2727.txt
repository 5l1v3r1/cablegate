SUBJECT: KAZAKHSTAN ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT TIFA 
 
REF: State 117583 
 
¶1. (U) Econoff delivered reftel points on September 28 to Damigul 
Kabiyeva, Head of the WTO accession Department.  Kabiyeva stated 
that she thought this summer's Trade and Investment Framework 
Agreement (TIFA) Council events in Washington were a success and 
reiterated Kazakhstan's commitment to developing the TIFA framework 
as a means of facilitating regional economic development. 
 
¶2. (U) Kabiyeva was quite supportive of the idea of holding 
expert-level preparatory events before next year's plenary session. 
Such an approach, she stated, would help make the political-level 
discussions more focused and fruitful.  She also suggested the 
possibility of launching concrete investment projects at future TIFA 
meetings. 
 
¶3. (U) Kabiyeva reacted favorably to the idea of holding next year's 
TIFA events in Central Asia, stating that holding them in the region 
may help attract business participation.  She noted that Dushanbe 
has recently hosted a number of multilateral meetings, adding that 
Kazakhstani officials go there "with pleasure."  Kabiyeva was 
somewhat less enthusiastic about Asghabat as a possible venue, but 
said that holding TIFA events there "may help bring Turkmenistan 
into the fold a little more."  She also suggested the possibility of 
determining meeting locations on a rotating basis (an approach, she 
noted, used by other regional organizations).  This, Kabiyeva said, 
would give each country a greater stake in the TIFA framework. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Still, Kabiyeva emphasized the importance of a continuing 
strong role of the U.S. in the TIFA process.  Initiatives, she 
noted, are received better if they come from the United States. 
Other Central Asian countries, she continued, are wary of the notion 
of Kazakhstan's "regional leadership."
