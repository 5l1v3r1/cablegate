¶2. (SBU) Incoming and outgoing Econ M/C's and Econoff 
presented August 31 reftel points and concept paper to 
Department of Mineral and Energy's Tseliso Maqubela, Chief 
Director, Nuclear Energy and Mahlatsi Koma, Deputy Director, 
International Relations.  Noting that he had not previously 
seen the IAEA concept paper, Maqubela expressed several 
general reservations.  He noted that a conventional nuclear 
energy program is a long-term undertaking, as much as 65 
years, and the international environment could change 
dramatically in that period.  He added that equity among 
countries was a key principle for South Africa and any 
arrangement should not perpetuate inequality.  The concept 
sounded like a group even more closed than the Nuclear 
Suppliers Group.  Personally, he thought the Generation IV 
structure represented a balanced approach.  In closing, 
Maqubela stated that Minerals and Energy Minister Sonjica 
would present the offficial South African view of the concept 
during the IAEA Special Event on Assurances in Vienna. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Asked about press reports that the Minister had 
stated that South Africa would enrich uranium, Maqubela said 
that the news media had not correctly quoted the Minister and 
provided econoffs with a copy of the Minister's August 25 
speech, which he had helped write.  Maqubela noted that news 
media were not present at the speech and that the Department 
of Minerals and Energy subsequently distributed the speech. 
Noting the expected rapid expansion of the nuclear energy 
industry worldwide and a predicted shortage of enriched 
uranium, Maqubela said South Africa would look at the uranium 
enrichment issue strictly in economic terms.  In an August 
25th conversation (septel) DFA DDG Abdul Minty told visiting 
USUNVIE COM Schulte that South Africa had made no decisions 
regarding possible uranium enrichment, but did not want to 
foreclose any options.  (Note: in her August 25 speech at the 
launch of the South African Young Nuclear Professionals 
Society, the Minister said, inter alia, quote: I therefore 
believe that time has come for South Africa to conduct a cost 
benefit analysis into the beneficiation of uranium.  I will 
soon be making certain announcements in this regard.  It goes 
without saying that beneficiation of uranium comes with its 
own responsibilities and sensitivities and we would pursue 
this within our national and international obligations.  End 
quote.  Full text of speech sent to AF/S  END NOTE).
