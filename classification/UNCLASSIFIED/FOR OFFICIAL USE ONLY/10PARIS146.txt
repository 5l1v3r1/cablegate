SUBJECT: French Response to US CITES COP 15 PROPOSALS 
 
REF: a) STATE 6668 B) STATE 10014 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On February 4, the French Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs told us that France agrees with the U.S. proposal on coral 
and shark, opposes the proposal on bobcat (because of look-alike 
concerns) and is still considering its position on polar bears.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On February 4, Pascal Sliwanski, Deputy Director of the 
Natural Resources and Biodiversity Division, provided ESTH Counselor 
with an inter-ministerial response to ref A's demarche.  France 
agrees with the U.S. proposal on listing the family Coralliidae in 
CITES Appendix II at CoP15 as necessary to prevent over 
exploitation. 
 
¶3. (U) Sharks:  France also shares the USG's concern.  Listing 
sharks under CITES Appendix II is a common goal at CoP15 as 
regulating international trade will help prevent over exploitation. 
(Ref B's demarche on the Manila shark meeting was provided to 
Sliwanski and to the Environment, and the Agriculture and Fisheries 
Ministries.) 
 
¶4. (U) Bobcat: France opposes deleting bobcats (Lynx rufus) from 
Appendix II because of possible harm to the protected look-alike 
species of Eurasian and Iberian Lynx. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Polar Bears:  France is still discussing the U.S. proposal 
with its scientists and policy makers.
