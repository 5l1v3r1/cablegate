(SBU) The following contains November 18 nuclear-related public 
statements by IRIG FM Mottaki, as reported by ISNA: 
 
 
 
TITLE: Foreign Minister in Conversation with ISNA: We Will Not 
Send Out our 3.5 Percent Enriched Fuel; We See 
 
Simultaneous Exchange of Fuel Inside Iran as Worthy of 
Examination: 
 
 
 
SUMMARY: In a November 18 ISNA press article, IRIG FM Manucher 
Mottaki made the following statements: 
 
 
 
- We consider simultaneous fuel exchange within Iran worthy of 
consideration. 
 
 
 
- [Re Tehran Research Reactor - (TRR)]: When our team went to 
Vienna, we were in a situation where we had announced to the 
IAEA that we wanted fuel.  The IAEA passed this request to 
Russia and the US.  The two countries announced to the IAEA that 
they were ready to provide this fuel.  When they announced this 
the IAEA said it would be appropriate to have discussions on 
this matter.  We looked into the matter and created a team to 
discuss this issue.   This team travelled to Vienna and there 
the proposal that was under consideration was presented to the 
Iranian delegation, not in written form, but the general shape 
of the proposal was put forward.  They announced they were ready 
to take Iran's 3.5 percent enriched uranium, enrich it to 20 
percent and return it.   According to this, Iran needed 116 kg 
of 20 percent enriched fuel in exchange for which it must give 
1160 kg, i.e. in increasing the enrichment to 20 percent this 
amount is reduced to 116 kg.  It was said that you need 116 kg 
of fuel and this 116 kg of fuel is equal to 1200 kg, which is 
where the 1200 kg number came from. 
 
 
 
- The Iranian delegation in Vienna was not authorized to make 
such a final decision on the spot.  Not even the AEOI Head was 
part of the delegation: his technical expert was there. 
Therefore it was obvious that the most initial response to such 
a proposal was that it had to be studied in Tehran and then the 
answer would be announced.   They [the West] announced that we 
had until Friday to respond.  This proposal was studied in 
Tehran and we announced our response to the IAEA.  The media 
reports that Iran hadn't given its answer and that they [IAEA, 
the West?] were waiting for it was the same old psychological 
warfare - in reality they wanted to say that we should give them 
the answer that they want. 
 
 
 
- Therefore we studied the issue.  We had concerns relating to 
it, the first of which was that we would not limit ourselves to 
this proposal.  Our first option was that we would ourselves 
produce the needed 20 percent enriched uranium.   Our second 
option is that we buy it.  The IAEA proposal was the third 
option, which we are studying.  Because they are pushing on this 
third option we sought to create an opportunity for them to 
examine this option.  Iran must study this option from various 
technical and economic dimensions, which is it has done. 
 
 
 
- We will definitely not export our 3.5 enriched fuel abroad. 
This means that we view the simultaneous transfer of fuel on 
Iranian soil as deserving of consideration.  Our technical 
experts must study the issue of how much fuel should be moved. 
The opinions they [The West] have given are not acceptable to 
our experts and our studies continue. 
 
 
 
- The propaganda coming from the West bears no relation with 
reality and our domestic media must be careful.  We have 
announced that the technical committee of the Vienna meeting 
should meet again so we can put forward our concerns.  Such a 
[follow-on] meeting has not yet been convened.

- Diplomacy is not "all or nothing", therefore Secretary Clinton 
saying that Iran must accept this proposal is not diplomatic.
