¶1. (SBU) MFA SecGen Kyrle told the Ambassador August 27 that 
he does not believe Egyptian Culture Minister Farouk Hosni 
will draw enough votes to win the race for the UNESCO 
Director General position on the first ballot.  Kyrle said he 
expects Austria's Benita Ferrero-Waldner to finish second to 
Hosni in the first round, and believes she has a good chance 
to surpass him in a subsequent ballot.  Several of the other 
candidates are likely to drop out along the way, and some of 
their supporters will then back Ferrero-Waldner, he 
predicted.  EU member states have discussed the UNESCO 
election informally, and will address the issue of what to do 
after the first round if Hosni fails to secure the position, 
he said.  At a reception to introduce Ferrero-Waldner to 
diplomatic representatives in Vienna, Ferrero-Waldner told 
Ambassador and DCM that she expects EU foreign ministers to 
discuss and agree on an EU-endorsed candidate at their next 
informal "Gymnich-format" meeting.  She expressed optimism 
about her prospects.  The French Charge, who formerly served 
in Cairo, told us that President Sarkozy had committed to 
Hosni in an unguarded moment and Paris was now looking at how 
to handle the situation.  The French felt Hosni would be 
problematic for UNESCO and the Charge added Hosni was known 
for being corrupt "even in Egypt" and did not have a clue 
about management. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kyrle, in his meeting with the Ambassador, 
maintained that Ferrero-Waldner's experience as EU 
Commissioner for External Affairs provides an ideal 
background for the UNESCO post.  As EU Commissioner, 
Ferrero-Waldner has been heavily involved in intercultural 
and inter-religious dialogue; she played a leading role, for 
example, in lowering tensions caused by the controversy over 
the 2005 publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet 
Mohammed, he said.  Much of her work has also been focused on 
improving education in the developing world -- a key element 
in promoting social justice, and directly related to UNESCO's 
cultural mission, he said.  Moreover, he added, 
Ferrero-Waldner oversees a workforce of more then 3,500 
people, demonstrating that she has the managerial skills to 
run a large organization.  The Ambassador replied that the 
U.S. is not officially endorsing any candidates, but 
considers Ferrero-Waldner to be among the well-qualified 
contenders.
