SUBJECT: (SBU) SEEKING GOE SUPPORT FOR COMMERCIAL TRANSIT 
OF DOD CARGO THROUGH ESTONIA 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request, please see paragraph 2. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post is requested to notify the GOE that the U.S 
plans the commercial shipment of non-lethal supplies for 
Afghanistan via the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) via 
the Port of Tallinn.  This effort is in support of the 
additional forces the U.S. will deploy to Afghanistan to 
advance stabilization and reconstruction.  The U.S. military 
currently ships a wide range of non-lethal supplies through 
Pakistan and via the Middle East, and has recently started 
transporting supplies via Europe, Russia and Central Asia. 
The United States has worked bilaterally with non-NATO 
transit 
countries to obtain approval for the shipment of non-lethal 
goods by commercial carriers.  NATO is developing a similar 
network of ISAF transit agreements. 
 
TALKING POINTS 
-------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU/releasable to the GOE) Post should emphasize the 
following points in requesting host government support: 
 
-- The United States wishes to notify the GOE that it is 
planning an initial shipment of non-lethal supplies through 
Estonia using commercial shippers and existing civilian 
transportation networks.  Cargo would enter the Port of 
Tallinn and be transported over Estonia's road and rail 
network.  The shipment would be one block train 
(approximately 100 20-foot containers). 
 
-- If successful, we would like to send subsequent shipments 
through Estonia that would transit Latvia, Russia, 
Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.  The United States already has 
obtained permission, where necessary, for such shipments. 
In March, the United States began shipping non-lethal cargo 
to 
Afghanistan from Riga through Russia and Central Asia. 
 
-- Specific volume to flow through Estonia will depend on a 
competitive bid process with commercial carriers.  If cost 
and time prove sufficiently competitive with other routes, 
sustained volume could be up to 50-60 containers per week. 
 
-- The supplies we would ship through Estonia include, but 
are not limited to, such items as food, tents, blankets, 
lumber, shampoo, etc.  We have neither the need nor the 
intention to ship sensitive or lethal cargo through Estonia. 
If our needs were to change, we would not ship sensitive or 
lethal cargo without your explicit permission. 
 
-- Any freight forwarder contracted by the U.S. Government 
would arrange transportation within Estonia.  These shipments 
would be handled by employees of the commercial carriers 
contracted by the U.S. Government. 
 
-- As with other commercial cargo, we understand that such 
shipments would be subject to relevant Estonian shipping and 
customs regulations. 
 
-- We will notify the GOE once arrangements for the shipment 
are finalized. 
 
-- We appreciate Estonia's contributions to international 
reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.  A secure, stable, 
and prosperous Afghanistan will reduce instability across 
Central Asia and is in NATO's interest. 
 
¶4. (SBU/releasable to the GOE) Action addressee may draw on 
the questions and answers below to explain the commercial 
transit of DOD cargo through Estonia.  These questions should 
only be answered if asked. 
 
Q: What would you like us to do? 
-- We do not require any specific support from your 
 
STATE 00086367  002 OF 002 
 
 
government, 
but as we value our close cooperation and consultation we 
want 
you to be fully informed of these activities. 
 
Q: What type of permission did Russia grant to the United 
States? 
-- The U.S. military ships non-lethal supplies by ground 
through Russia in accordance with the NATO-Russia ISAF 
transit 
arrangement. 
 
Q: Could you share with us one of the agreements you have 
concluded? 
-- We would be happy to provide you with a draft exchange of 
diplomatic notes that would be similar to the texts concluded 
with other countries.  It is not our practice to share with 
third countries our bilateral arrangements. 
 
 
Q: How do you define "non-lethal supplies"? 
-- We define "non-lethal" as any goods not included in the 
categories of "lethal goods" in the Russia-NATO exchange of 
letters.  Per the NATO-Russia exchange of letters, lethal 
goods include explosives, weapons, military aircraft and 
vehicles. 
 
Q: Will there be any U.S. military personnel accompanying 
these shipments? 
-- There will be no U.S. military personnel accompanying 
these 
shipments through the Northern Distribution Network (NDN). 
Shipments will be handled by commercial transportation 
companies, 
in accordance with contracts with the Department of Defense 
(DOD). 
 
Q: Will DOD be publicizing this route the way NDN has been 
publicized? 
-- DOD has not sought to publicize NDN routes, but as this is 
an unclassified, commercial venture, it could become public 
knowledge over time. 
 
¶5. (U) We welcome any feedback from the GOE
