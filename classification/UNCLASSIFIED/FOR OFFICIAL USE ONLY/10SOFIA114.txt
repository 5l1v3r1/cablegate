 Â¶1. (SBU) Post delivered reftel points to Liuba Zaharieva, 
representative for the Department of Developmental Aid at the 
MFA's UN/Global Issues Directorate.  According to Zaharieva, 
Bulgaria does not plan to send aid to MINUSTAH.  Bulgaria has 
already dispatched over 70 medical personnel, a field 
hospital, medicines and supplies.  In February, the 
government pledged an additional 125,000 euros through UNICEF 
for the relief effort.  According to Zaharieva, Bulgaria does 
not plan any additional assistance beyond its current 
contributions.
