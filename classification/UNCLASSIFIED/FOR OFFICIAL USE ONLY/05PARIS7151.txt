SUBJECT: DEMARCHE REQUESTING THE FRENCH TO PRESS RUSSIA TO 
SUPPORT SUA AMENDMENTS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 163028 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On September 6, ESTH/NP officer delivered reftel 
demarche urging France to press for Russian support to amend 
the UN Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts 
Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA), to French 
MFA desk officer for Nuclear Nonproliferation, Sebastian 
Jaunet.  Jaunet promised to circulate the points to the 
French inter-agency experts involved in SUA negotiations.  At 
Jaunet's request, on October 6, ESTH/NP officer met with him 
at the MFA for a 'read-out' of the October 5 French demarche 
to the Russian Embassy in Paris on the SUA topic.  Jaunet 
advised that during the French/Russian meeting the French had 
sought to send two clear messages to the Russians regarding 
SUA, namely: that the Russians should join consensus on the 
SUA amendments and that they should not attempt to reopen 
negotiations on the text.  According to Jaunet, the French 
explained to the Russians that any attempt to reopen the text 
might lead to the unraveling of three years of work by 
experts in preparing the amended text.  The French reminded 
the Russians that the arduous process of formulating the text 
had been done in close coordination with their government, 
and, subsequently, the Russians should not be surprised by 
anything contained in the text. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Jaunet characterized the Russian response as 
"noncommittal."  The Russians claimed that while Russian 
legal experts had studied the text closely, the 
nonproliferation experts in Moscow had not studied it in 
depth, and no official guidance had been received from the 
nonproliferation office on the Russian position.  The 
Russians added that they hoped to soon receive guidance, but 
could not assure the French that there would not be some 
"difficulties." 
 
(3)  (SBU) Jaunet promised to keep ESTH/NP officer apprised 
of any further response from the Russian Embassy on the 
matter.  ESTH/NP thanked Jaunet for the French government's 
cooperation on this issue of mutual concern.
