SUBJECT: PRT Civil Society Outreach in Diyala's Farm Sector 
 
¶1. (U) This is a PRT Diyala reporting cable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY: PRT Diyala has conducted outreach and support 
activities with the Agricultural Chamber of Commerce and the Diyala 
Beekeepers Association.  Allegations of violence within the Diyala 
Farmers' Union has required the PRT to step back from supporting 
what at first appeared to be a promising civil society organization. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The inaugural meeting of the Diyala Farmer's Union was held 
at their new building in Baqubah in September.  In addition to more 
than 300 Diyala farmers, the National Farmers Union Representative 
for Diyala Province, the Assistant Governor for Administrative 
Affairs, a representative of the Iraqi Police, and a representative 
of the Provincial Council Agriculture Committee Chairman, were all 
present at the inaugural meeting. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A vote was held for the membership of the Governing Board 
after a meal and speeches.  In addition to the President, Vice 
President, and General Secretary, seven delegates were elected to 
represent the provincial farmers. The chosen delegates were 
representative of all religious groups and thus represented a 
potential vehicle for reconciliation using agricultural interests in 
Diyala. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Although this fine beginning seemed to augur well for the 
Union, the PRT has had to step back from its support for the 
organization due to conflict within the leadership in October. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The PRT is also supporting the Agricultural Chamber of 
Commerce which will enable better services to be provided to 
provincial agriculturalists, and increase the opportunity that they 
have to influence government operation. Funding has been provided to 
renovate an administrative and meeting building, and to support 
their first year of operation. 
 
¶7. (SBU) PRT continues to collaborate with the Diyala Beekeepers 
Association as well, particularly on importing honey processing 
equipment which will greatly benefit members of the association and 
enable commercial sales to commence.
