SUBJECT: TURKISH MILITARY ESTABLISHES TEMPORARY SECURITY 
ZONES IN SOUTHEAST TURKEY 
 
REF: DIA IIR 6 898 0362 07 
 
¶1. (U) The Turkish General Staff (TGS) website on June 7 
posted the coordinates of four areas within the southeastern 
provinces of Siirt, Sirnak and Hakkari that will be 
designated as Temporary Security Zones for the purposes of 
military operations.  Entry into and exit from these zones 
will be restricted from June 9 until September 9, 2007. 
By definition, they are created around areas where military 
operations are occurring and restrict entry to these areas by 
land, air and sea.  According to TGS and Foreign Ministry 
contacts, Temporary Security Zones have been established in 
the past around areas of military operations against the PKK. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) The security zones do not cover any of the provinces 
in their entirety.  Based on the coordinates, the areas 
appear to be sparsely-populated remote mountainous regions or 
valleys, several of which have been the location of 
significant clashes with the PKK terrorist organization. 
Only a single point of one of the four zones abuts the border 
with Iraq.  The zones range in size from approximately 10 to 
35 kilometers in width and 5 to 25 kilometers in length.  The 
Habur Gate border crossing and the primary truck route 
leading to the border are not included in the zone.  Checks 
with US military personnel responsible for Habur operations 
confirm business as usual at the crossing. 
 
¶3. (SBU) TGS has indicated that it will issue a Notice to 
Airmen (NOTAM) that will restrict some airspace along the 
Turkey-Iraq border but we do not expect this to impact on 
civilian or Coalition aircraft transiting Turkey from Iraq. 
We are checking with the Foreign Ministry for further 
specifics on the security zones and their possible impact on 
our movements in those provinces, and will forward any 
information that becomes available.

the TGS website:
