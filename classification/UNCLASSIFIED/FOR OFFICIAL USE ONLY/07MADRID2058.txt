SUBJECT: SPAIN: VERDICTS HANDED DOWN IN THE TRIAL OF THE 
MARCH 11, 2004, MADRID TRAIN BOMBINGS 
 
MADRID 00002058  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1. (U) Spain's National Court on October 31 returned guilty 
verdicts on 21 of the 28 people accused of involvement in the 
March 11, 2004 train bombings in Madrid (known in Spain as 
11-M), which killed 191 and injured over 1,800.  An 
additional seven individuals were acquitted.  A 29th 
defendant had been acquitted earlier in the trial process. 
The sentences levied by Spanish Judge Javier Gomez-Bermudez 
ranged from three years to 42,924 years, but under Spanish 
law the maximum jail term an individual can serve for 
terrorist crimes is 40 years.  Only three individuals were 
actually charged with complicity in the 11-M attacks; the 
remaining individuals were convicted for belonging to a 
terrorist organization, cooperating with a terrorist 
organization, trafficking in explosives and/or document 
forgery.  One of the individuals acquitted today by Spain's 
anti-terrorist court was Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed, known as 
"Mohammed the Egyptian," who prosecutors had said was the 
brains behind the operation.  Osman is currently serving jail 
time in Italy on other terrorist charges.  A complete list of 
the convictions, sentences, and acquittals is below. 
 
¶2. (U) The near-simultaneous bombings on four packed commuter 
trains were the deadliest terror strikes on the West since 
the September 11th attacks against the U.S. and changed the 
course of Spain's general election.  Before the train 
bombings, the Partido Popular (PP) held a four-percentage 
point lead in the polls.  Just three days later, the 
frightened and angry Spanish electorate gave President 
Zapatero's Socialist party a four-percentage point victory. 
In many ways, the PP has yet to get over the sudden twist of 
fate and the entire 11-M investigation and trial have been 
rife with controversy and political tension.  There have been 
allegations of a police cover-up and involvement by the 
Spanish government, and a segment of the Spanish population 
clings to various conspiracy theories.  Some sectors of the 
PP and select Spanish media outlets maintained that the 
Basque terrorist group ETA was somehow involved in the 
attacks, but Judge Gomez-Bermudez said definitively today 
that there was no/no evidence of ETA involvement.  Many in 
the Socialist party have said that Spain was attacked because 
of its participation in the Iraq war under former President 
Aznar, but Judge Gomez-Bermudez made no mention of Iraq in 
his verdict. 
 
//COMMENT// 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The Spanish government, including its law 
enforcement and intelligence services, government ministries, 
and national prosecutors and judges, came together to carry 
out an in-depth and comprehensive investigation, prosecution 
and trial on an issue of supreme national security and 
political importance.  Indeed, Spain has been fairly 
criticized for not ably managing inter-agency cooperation on 
counterterrorism and law enforcement matters.  In this 
instance, however, the Spanish government was able to 
energize and bring together its inter-agency community in a 
focused and highly-effective manner.  This process was 
carried out in an open, transparent, and public way, despite 
the emotional circumstances of the attacks and the heightened 
political tensions and controversies surrounding its 
aftermath.  Some alleged terrorists were acquitted today, and 
there will always be criticisms from various sectors about 
what could have been done better, but on the whole, this is a 
good day for Spain.  This is also a good day for the United 
States and our allies who are committed to the fight against 
international terrorism.  The trial and its aftermath are 
sure to remain a political issue in advance of national 
elections, but terrorism receives no quarter from the Spanish 
public or any of the serious political parties.  The entire 
11-M process, from initial investigations to the final 
verdicts, once again demonstrates that Spain remains a 
serious and reliable partner in the fight against terror.
