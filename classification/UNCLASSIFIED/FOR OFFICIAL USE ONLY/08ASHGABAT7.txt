SUBJECT: TURKMENISTAN PLAYING HARDBALL WITH IRAN OVER GAS 
PRICES 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (U) Now that Turkmenistan has reached agreement with the 
China National Petroleum Company and Gazprom on new prices 
for its natural gas, Turkmenistan has turned its focus to 
Iran, to which it sells approximately 8 billion cubic meters 
of gas per year at a price of $65 per thousand cubic meters 
(tcm) of gas.  This price is substantially below the price of 
$130 per tcm that Gazprom has agreed to pay in the first half 
of 2008 and $150 per tcm that it will pay effective July 1. 
An Iranian delegation arrived in Ashgabat on December 28 to 
begin negotiations, and by January 2 there were press reports 
that Turkmenistan stopped transporting gas to northern Iran 
via the Korpeje-to-Kurt-Kui pipeline.  According to a press 
release issued by Turkmenistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
Turkmenistan temporarily halted the flow of gas to Iran in 
order to carry out preventive repair work on the pipeline. 
The Iranian-based ISNA news agency reported that Iranian 
officials are insisting that the price they negotiated last 
year should continue to apply in 2008. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) There are no indications as yet that this stoppage 
has affected the flow of the approximately 400,000 tons of 
liquified petroleum gas (LPG) that Turkmenistan's state firms 
sell per year to Iran.  These deals, which are made primarily 
with Iranian businessmen and which exist in part as repayment 
for Iranian construction of LPG terminal and tank farm 
facilities in Turkmenistan, are made at prices closely linked 
to the Platts price. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Post believes the pipeline stoppage is a 
hardball effort to pressure the Iranian government into 
agreeing to a price increase.  Turning off pipelines for 
"temporary repairs" is a strategy that Turkmenistan has used 
in the past -- most recently during its 2006 negotiations 
with Gazprom to raise gas payments from $65 to $100 per tcm. 
Further strengthening this argument is the fact that the 
Korpeje-to-Kurt-Kui pipeline is relatively new (it was only 
commissioned in December 1997), making the claims of needed 
repairs somewhat suspect.  While posturing by both sides 
seems to be in full swing at this point, neither can afford a 
long-term stoppage.  Iranians in the north rely on 
Turkmenistani gas for winter heat, and Turkmenistan needs all 
the hydrocarbon revenue it can get to fund its ongoing 
construction and development programs.
