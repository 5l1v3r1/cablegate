(SBU) In a September 2 meeting with Econ Counselor, GOT DDG 
Energy Mithat Rende said that Turkey was receptive to 
Georgia's request for additional gas from Turkey's share of 
Shah Deniz gas and understood the importance the USG placed 
on breaking Gazprom's monopolistic hold on the Georgian gas 
market.  However, Rende said that Turkey needed the 6 BCM per 
year destined for Turkey for it to diversify its gas supply 
(from dependence on Russia and Gazprom) and for it to develop 
as a serious transit country to Europe (only the Shah Deniz 
gas allows Turkey re-export rights).  In response to a recent 
letter from the Georgian PM, he expected that the Turkish PM 
would propose a bilateral working group to explore options 
including the Georgian request, but also other ideas such as 
seeking greater output from Azerbaijan.  (Note: Per Reftel 
DAS Bryza raised this issue with MENR U/S, who deferred to 
MFA on this national interest question.  End Note.)
