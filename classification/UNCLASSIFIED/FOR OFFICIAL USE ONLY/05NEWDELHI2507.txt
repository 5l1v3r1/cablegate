SUBJECT: GOI RESPONSE: PRIORITIZING INDIAN ASSISTANCE TO 
IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 58131 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On April 4, the DCM delivered Ambassador Jones' 
message (reftel) suggesting that the GOI could help build 
capacity in the Iraqi judiciary system to MEA Joint Secretary 
(Americas) S. Jaishankar.  Jaishankar agreed to pass along 
the request, but asked that the DCM convey to Ambassador 
Jones his suggestion that India could more suitably provide 
assistance to the Iraqi civil service.  The DCM agreed to do 
so, but urged that the GOI communicate its capabilities 
directly to the Iraqis. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Jaishankar noted that Indian judges are not 
"investigative judges," as mentioned in the letter, and 
pointed out that India's strength was in its civil service 
training capabilities.  Each of the civil service branches 
has its own training facility, he explained, listing the 
areas of Indian expertise as administration, accounting 
(India audits the UN, he highlighted), and budgeting. 
 
¶3.  (U) Baghdad minimize considered.
