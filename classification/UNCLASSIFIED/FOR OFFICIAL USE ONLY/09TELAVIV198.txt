REF: TEL AVIV 28 
 
¶1.  This is a joint Embassy Tel Aviv and Consulate General Jerusalem 
message. 
 
¶2.  With a cease fire now in effect in the Gaza Strip, Embassy Tel 
Aviv and Consulate General Jerusalem are lifting the request to 
defer all non-Mission-critical travel to either post (reftel). 
 
¶3.  Official USG travel to the West Bank remains limited to 
mission-critical movements, given continued uncertainty about the 
security environment in the aftermath of fighting in Gaza.  Please 
note that  requests for visits to the West Bank may not be approved 
at this time. 
 
¶4.  Department is requested to repeat this message as appropriate.
