SUBJECT: UAE TRAINING IRAQI DIPLOMATS 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Nine Iraqi diplomats are currently receiving six 
weeks of training offered by the Emirates Institute of 
Diplomacy, which is an integral part of the UAE Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  The training, which Iraq,s Foreign 
Ministry requested, consists of a series of lectures on 
topics ranging from the historical relationship between the 
Gulf and Iraq to international law.  All expenses related to 
the training, including transportation between Baghdad and 
Abu Dhabi, are being paid by the UAEG. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Dr. Yousuf Al Hassan, the director of the Emirates 
Institute of Diplomacy, told Pol Chief on February 23 that he 
designed a curriculum that would professionalize the Iraqi 
diplomats by giving them the tools they would need to be 
effective in their jobs.  The training includes sessions on 
protocol, Internet usage, and handling sensitive documents. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Al Hassan said that he also wants to sensitize the 
Iraqi diplomats to some of the attitudes that exist outside 
Iraq, particularly in neighboring Gulf states.  &Most of the 
trainees have never been outside Iraq8 and have no idea how 
they are perceived by fellow Arabs, he said.  As part of the 
training, which began February 7, the Iraqi diplomats spend a 
portion of their day with UAE diplomats-in-training at the 
Abu Dhabi-based institute.  &This experience is creating 
bonds of friendship that will last years,8 Al Hassan said. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Of the nine Iraqi diplomats, two are females, Al 
Hassan said.  Six are relatively new to the Iraqi diplomatic 
corps, having served three months or less.  Al Hassan said 
that there have been no signs of enmity among the Iraqis, 
even though the group includes Shi,as, Sunnis, Kurds, and a 
Christian.  While at the institute, the Iraqis also will 
learn about the UN, proposals for UN reforms and enlargement 
of the UNSC; the Arab League and proposals for its reform; 
political regimes in the Gulf; negotiation skills; public 
diplomacy; economic diplomacy; and a survey of post-election 
Iraq.  Al Hassan said that the UAE is one of several 
countries, including Egypt, Jordan, Iran, and France, that 
are offering training to Iraqi diplomats.
