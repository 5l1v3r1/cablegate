SUBJECT: ZIMBABWE AGREEMENT: DIVIDED UNSC REACTION 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: In a September 19 briefing to the Security 
Council, A/SYG Menkerios called the Zimbabwe power-sharing 
agreement a "delicate compromise."  He hoped that an ongoing 
dispute about division of portfolios between the Mugabe and 
Tsvangirai camps would prove a short-lived "snag."  He 
reiterated the need for Zimbabwean authorities to allow 
unfettered access to humanitarian assistance, warned of the 
dire need for food aid, and called on donors to assist. 
Council members expressed support for the agreement.  Several 
members (UK, U.S., France) called for rapid implementation of 
the agreement and lifting of remaining restrictions on 
humanitarian operations.  Other members (Russia, South 
Africa) urged patience from the international community on 
the agreement's implementation.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MENKERIOS DESCRIBES AGREEMENT AS "DELICATE" 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In the first Security Council session on Zimbabwe 
since the September 15 signing of the Zimbabwe power-sharing 
agreement, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political 
Affairs Haile Menkerios reviewed the Zimbabwe agreement, 
describing it as "a delicate compromise," in which ZANU will 
receive 15 seats, the MDC-Tsvangirai 13 seats and the 
MDC-Mutumbara 3 seats.  He stated that ministerial portfolio 
division remained "a snag" but believed the parties would 
resolve it soon.  He reiterated the Secretary-General's 
message urging Zimbabwean authorities to facilitate 
unhindered access to humanitarian assistance.  He called on 
donors to provide food aid, stating that 3.8 million 
Zimbabweans will need food between October and December, and 
5.1 million between January and March.  "If properly 
implemented," he said, the agreement could change the lives 
of Zimbabweans.  He concluded by urging the parties to 
continue to consult. 
 
SOME UNSC MEMBERS EXPRESS CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Many UNSC members, including the U.S., UK, Belgium, 
and France, emphasized the new partners' responsibility to 
implement the agreement, and called on authorities to lift 
restrictions on humanitarian operations.  Members raised 
other issues, including Belgium's mention of the recent 
arrest of a trade unionist.  China (also stating that 
implementation will be important) added that Zimbabweans will 
be disappointed if the new government does not succeed. 
Italy said the agreement "may not represent the end of the 
crisis."  Burkina Faso said they hope Zimbabwe overcomes the 
difficulty in assigning ministerial posts. 
 
OTHER MEMBERS CALL FOR PATIENCE WITH IMPLEMENTATION 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Other UNSC members, including Russia and South 
Africa, referred to the agreement as a breakthrough and urged 
members to be patient with implementation.  Russia deemed the 
agreement a success "of negotiation over use of force." 
South Africa stated that "cabinets are not formed overnight" 
and added that Kenya took "several weeks" to form a cabinet. 
While South Africa agreed with other UNSC members that the 
humanitarian situation is "very bad," they added that both 
negotiating parties agreed to address it immediately.
