ASEAN Secretariat Staff Outline Plans for Integration 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) ASEAN Deputy Secretary General for Economic Affairs 
Nicholas Tandi Dammen and his staff provided U/S Jeffery with a 
brief overview of ASEAN's draft blueprint for economic integration. 
ASEAN staff noted that the key thrust of the blueprint is to build a 
single ASEAN market and production base by 2015.  In an effort to 
achieve that goal, the blueprint also focuses on enhancing 
competitiveness in the region, providing equitable economic growth, 
and increasing economic integration with the rest of the world. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ASEAN is currently in the early stages of enhancing 
competition policies at the national level, while its blueprint for 
achieving equitable economic growth centers on increasing 
development in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Burma, as well as 
sub-ASEAN regions where high levels of poverty persist.  ASEAN staff 
highlighted their efforts to complete free trade agreements (FTAs) 
with important trading partners.  ASEAN has engaged in FTA 
negotiations with a large number of countries, including China and 
Korea, with which ASEAN has concluded agreements; Japan, Australia 
and New Zealand, with which ASEAN will complete agreements in the 
next year or two; and the European Union, with which ASEAN will 
begin negotiations in the near term. 
 
¶4. (SBU) ASEAN Secretariat staff also expressed appreciation for the 
United States' robust cooperation with ASEAN on trade and economic 
issues, particularly in the area of capacity building.  Secretariat 
staff specifically noted that the U.S. has provided strong 
assistance for the ASEAN "single window" initiative and ASEAN's 
effort to improve member countries' ability to protect intellectual 
property rights (IPR).  ASEAN Secretariat staff noted that while 
ASEAN member country views on the importance of IPR issues were not 
uniform, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's technical assistance 
in this area has helped narrow the gap in viewpoints within ASEAN. 
 
 
U/S Jeffery Confirms Summit Invitation, Talks Burma 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) U/S Jeffery noted that the important role that ASEAN plays 
in the region and underscored U.S. support for ASEAN's plans for 
economic integration.  He also confirmed that President Bush had 
extended an invitation to the leaders of ASEAN to visit Texas for a 
Commemorative Summit during the end of 2007 or early 2008.  He noted 
that the U.S. would invite Burma, as a member of ASEAN, but that the 
organizers would determine the level of Burmese representation to 
the Summit after ASEAN and the U.S. decide on a date. 
 
¶6. (SBU) U/S Jeffery also asked Deputy Secretary General Dammen his 
views on engaging Burma.  ASEAN Secretariat staff replied that ASEAN 
would have limited leverage over the Burmese government as long as 
India and China provide strong support for Burma's economy.  As long 
as India and China provide economic support for Burma, economic 
sanctions are unlikely to have a significant impact.  Instead, ASEAN 
questioned whether a more positive approach, such as significantly 
increasing economic cooperation with Burma, would be more a more 
effective mechanism to gain influence and effect change in Rangoon.
