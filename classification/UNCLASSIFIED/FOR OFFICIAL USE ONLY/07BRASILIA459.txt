REF:  STATE 30804 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  In a March 13 meeting, Charge and Acting DCM presented to 
the head of the Brazil Foreign Ministry's NAMA office (Carlos 
Henrique Abreu e Silva) reftel demarche points.  Abreu e Silva noted 
that he was already aware of the issue - probably because the EU had 
previously presented him with a similar demarche - and would 
endeavor to get back to us with a substantive response.  Later, on 
March 14, Mission's Senior Commercial Officer and Commercial Attache 
conveyed the demarche to high-level contacts at the Ministry of 
Development, Industry, and Commerce. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post shall continue to monitor this issue and will report 
further developments to Washington agencies.
