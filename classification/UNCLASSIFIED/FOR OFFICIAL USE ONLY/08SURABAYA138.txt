¶1.  (SBU) Summary: US Technical Advisor for the Sidoarjo 
Mudflow, Dr. Van Williams arrived in Surabaya on December 18 
following a November survey of the mudflow site, and discussions 
with the Sidoarjo Mud Management Agency (BPLS), the Center of 
Volcanology and Disaster Mitigation and the Department of Energy 
and Mineral Resources (reftel).  Dr. Williams is a Scientist 
Emeritus of the US Geologic Survey (USGS) and will be based at 
the Consulate General Surabaya and the Sidoarjo Mud Management 
Agency during his initial six month contract.  Indonesian 
officials expressed appreciation for the advisor and his 
anticipated contribution in developing a strategy to mitigate 
the effect of the mudflow. End Summary 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U) Between October 31and November 11, Dr. Williams, fellow 
USGS Scientist Emeritus Dr. Tom Casadevall, and Dr. Michael 
Sharp of the US Army Corps of Engineers visited the mudflow site 
and attended a series of meetings with the Sidoarjo Mud 
Management Agency (BPLS).  This visit was part of the US 
Mission's effort to assist Indonesian authorities with mudflow 
mitigation.  Key goals of the visit were to assess current 
conditions on site and further define the role of the US 
technical advisor working with BPLS and the Ministry of Public 
Works.  The US scientists also attended meetings with the 
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (reftel), and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jakarta.  In Bandung, they 
visited the Center of Volcanology and Geological Disaster 
Mitigation.

¶3.  (SBU) The team's visit to the mudflow was the second for Dr. 
Casadevall, and his experience allowed him to evaluate BPLS's 
progress.  The team arrived onsite just at the beginning of the 
rainy season, and they were able to observe efforts to increase 
the flow of mud out to sea following the dry season and its low 
river levels.  The visit also coincided with news that money for 
mitigation at the epicenter has been cut by up to 75%, (reftel). 
 A subsequent dike breach on November 18 has proven the concerns 
of BPLS geologists, that stalled funds are endangering the 
containment system at it most vulnerable time--the onset of the 
rainy season. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U) As of December 18, compensation has been paid to a 
majority of victims identified in a Presidential Decree. 
However financial troubles experienced by the holding company 
responsible for making the payments have cast doubt on the 
viability of the compensation scheme (reftel).  Current heavy 
rains have reduced silting in the Porong River used by BPLS to 
move mud out to sea.  On December 17, BPLS announced plans to 
expand mud storage capacity by 30 million cubic meters.  A new 
dike wall eleven meters high will enclose 30 square hectares in 
Besuki Village and is scheduled for completion in April 2009. 
BPLS also plans to create 70 square hectares of mud 
holding-ponds in Renokenongo Village.  Villagers oppose the plan 
and regularly demonstrate near the worksite because many 
residents have yet to receive final compensation payments.

¶5. (SBU) During a November 10 meeting with Secretary General of 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Imron Cotan, Dr. Casadevall 
described current conditions at the mudflow site and his 
positive impression of BPLS operations in handling them given 
the enormity of the job.  Dr. Casadevall also explained the role 
of the US technical advisor to the mudflow.  Secretary General 
Cotan expressed his appreciation to the United States for its 
efforts.  He also noted that while the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs does not have a formal role in the cooperation, it is 
proof of a good working relationship between the two countries 
and should be widely publicized. 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) The team provided their Indonesian hosts with a USGS 
report on the chemistry of the mud based on a sample provided to 
Dr. Casadevall during his September 2007 visit.  According to 
Dr. Casadevall, there is no increased health risk due to the 
chemical contents of the mud; however the size of the mud 
particles could be detrimental to human health if inhaled as 
dust. The current visit established several key areas for 
fruitful US-Indonesian cooperation at the site to include 
assistance with assessing the capacity of the river to continue 
to carry mud out to sea.  BPLS Head Mr. Sunarso and Minister 
Purnomo Yusgiantoro expressed appreciation and support for the 
work of the advisor.
