¶1. (SBU) Summary:  According to November 10 and 11 local media 
reports, Government of National Unity (GNU) Humanitarian Aid 
Commission (HAC) Commissioner Hassabo Abdel-Rahman announced on 
UN-sponsored radio that the Sudanese government is planning to close 
Darfur internally displaced person (IDP) camps by early 2010. 
However, when Deputy Special Representative of the UN Secretary 
General (DSRSG) Ameerah Haq questioned the HAC Commissioner about 
the announcement, Hassabo claimed that he was misquoted and that 
returns would not be forced.  In a November 16 meeting with members 
of the U.S. Special Envoy's (SE) office, Hassabo reiterated support 
for IDPs' voluntary choice to return but continued to outline only 
two choices for Darfuri IDPs, government-provided housing blocks or 
return to villages.  The UN is considering issuing a statement 
emphasizing international standards for voluntary and appropriate 
returns.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) According to English-language media outlets Sudan Tribune and 
Khartoum Monitor, Hassabo announced to UN-sponsored Miraya FM radio 
on November 10 that the Sudanese government plans to close IDP camps 
in the greater Darfur region by early 2010.  The independent, 
Arabic-language daily Al-Sahafa quoted the HAC Commissioner as 
stating that the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs is "converting aid 
money to a service program to rehabilitate villages."  According to 
the Al-Sahafa report, the government is constructing 20,000 housing 
units for IDPs in El Fasher, North Darfur; El Geneina, West Darfur; 
and Nyala, South Darfur. (Note: None of the media reports clearly 
indicates whether the government construction campaign will include 
a total of 60,000 units, with 20,000 in each state, or only a total 
of 20,000 units.  In either case, the government's proposed housing 
units, if constructed, would provide housing for a very small 
proportion of the IDP population, currently estimated at 2.7 million 
individuals. End note). 
 
¶3. (U) In addition, the Miraya FM report indicates that Hassabo 
outlined two choices for IDPs, either to return to villages of 
origin or move into new housing complexes.  Hassabo did not specify 
the consequences for rejecting these options.  The Sudan Tribune and 
Khartoum Monitor reports include strong statements from armed 
opposition group leaders condemning the HAC announcement. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On November 12, USAID Mission Director William Hammink 
discussed the recent media reports with DSRSG Ameerah Haq.  DSRSG 
Haq had approached Hassabo regarding the announcement on November 
11, and the HAC Commissioner confirmed announcing the construction 
of housing units in the Darfur capitals but strongly denied that the 
government intended to force IDPs to return to villages of origin or 
move to the housing units.  Hassabo asserted that Miraya FM had 
misquoted him and affirmed to DSRSG Haq the importance of voluntary 
and appropriate returns.  The DSRSG also informed USAID that the UN 
is considering issuing a statement to emphasize international 
standards for voluntary and appropriate returns.  In a November 16 
meeting with SE office staff, Hassabo reiterated support for 
voluntary returns but continued to outline only two choices for 
Darfuri IDPs, government-provided housing blocks or return to 
villages.  Hassabo requested additional donor support to rural areas 
to prevent IDPs from aborting returns in favor of camp services. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  The Sudanese government has made multiple 
attempts to dismantle large, urban camps in Darfur dating back to 
the onset of the Darfur crisis (see reftels).  This latest media 
story on forced IDP returnees has been refuted by Mr. Hassabo, but 
it does indicate continued GOS intentions to force choices on the 
IDPs, i.e. government-provided housing in towns or return to 
villages of origin.  Post continues to urge the Sudanese government 
to abide by international principles for returns and closely monitor 
the situation.
