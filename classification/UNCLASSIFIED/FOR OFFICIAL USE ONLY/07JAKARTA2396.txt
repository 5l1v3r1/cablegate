SUBJECT: AVIAN INFLUENZA - DAS MARCIEL MEETS WITH KOMNAS SECRETARY 
KRISNAMURTHI 
 
1.(SBU) National Committee on Avian Influenza Management and 
Pandemic Alert (KOMNAS) Secretary Bayu Krisnamurthi praised USG 
contributions towards avian influenza control during an August 28 
meeting with EAP Deputy Assistant Secretary (DAS) Scot Marciel. 
Bayu singled out for praise NAMRU-2's, CDC's and USAID's early 
contributions when NAMRU first identified human cases of avian 
influenza in 2005. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Marciel impressed upon Bayu USG avian influenza virus 
sample sharing concerns, stressing Washington's concerns about the 
serious risks associated with not sharing samples.  He applauded the 
Ministry of Health's recent sharing of Bali samples with the Centers 
for Disease Control and emphasized the need for resuming full sample 
sharing rapidly.  When asked for his thoughts on resolving the 
sample sharing impasse, Bayu responded that he thought a solution 
was already underway in the "WHO pipeline" but that any solution 
would need to address economic aspects including shared vaccine 
development for Indonesia. Bayu also mentioned that he had heard 
that Minister of Health Fadilah Supari might accompany President 
Yudhoyono to the US at the end of September. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Bayu's reference to the Minister's visit is the 
first time we have heard of her possible travel plans.  Our 
crosscheck with the MOH protocol office corroborated that the 
Minister of Health  planned to travel to the US for September 19-25. 
 The protocol office could not confirm whether she will accompany 
President Yudhoyono to New York but the dates coincide. We are 
checking with other MOH contacts to learn more about this planned 
travel.
