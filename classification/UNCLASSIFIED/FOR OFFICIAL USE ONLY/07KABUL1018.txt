SUBJECT: PRT LASHKAR GAH: FOURTH SUICIDE BOMBING IN HELMAND 
PROVINCIAL CENTER 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On March 27 at approximately 1150 local time, a 
suicide bomber blew himself up in downtown Lashkar Gah, 
provincial center of Helmand Province.  The incident occurred 
at the headquarters of the Afghan National Police (ANP). 
(NOTE: The headquarters is across from the entrance to 
Lashkar Gah's "green zone", the semi-secure street that 
houses the Governor's compound and other buildings and was 
the site of two suicide bombings last year.  END NOTE.)  The 
bomber arrived riding a motorcycle, dismounted, and attempted 
to enter the compound.  The provincial police chief told 
reporters that the bomber, wearing an Afghan National Army 
uniform, detonated the device as ANP were searching him at 
the compound's entrance.  A report from one Afghan eye 
witness (forwarded to PRTOff) described a number of dead 
bodies and body parts in the compound. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Four ANP were reportedly killed in the blast, 
including the commander of the check point at the entrance to 
the headquarters.  The local hospital reported three ANP 
injured, and no civilian injuries, though another report 
identified (likely slight) injuries to three civilians. 
Press reports identified only one injured person.  The 
Helmand Task Force assisted in the return of one of the ANP 
to family in Kabul. 
 
¶3.  (U) The radio carried the claim of a Taliban spokesman 
that the bomber's target was a security meeting supposedly 
taking place inside the headquarters.  To reporters, the 
police chief identified himself as the bomber's target. 
 
¶4.  (U) This was the fourth suicide bombing attack this year 
in Helmand, the third this month, and the first to kill 
anyone other than the bomber.
