¶1.  (SBU) Israeli police on August 2 recommended to Attorney General 
Menachem Mazuz that he indict Foreign Minister Avidgor Liberman on 
charges of bribery, money laundering, obstruction of justice, fraud, 
and breach of trust.  The recommendation followed an eight-year 
investigation into Lieberman's business activities.  Mazuz is 
expected to make a decision in approximately two months on whether to 
indict the Yisrael Beitenu leader.  Liberman's immediate reaction was 
to accuse the police of persecuting him, and he suggested there were 
political motivations behind the investigation.  On August 3, 
however, Liberman told a meeting of his faction that his conscience 
was clear and that he did not expect an indictment, but that if 
indicted he would immediately resign from his ministry, and within 
three to five months he would also resign from the Knesset and from 
his position as party chairman. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Israeli press covered the developments closely this 
weekend, but there was no media frenzy, as the police recommendation 
was widely expected.  Pundits are speculating as to who would take 
over for Liberman should he resign, but it is largely a guessing 
game.  Liberman's influence over the party is so pervasive that his 
colleagues are reluctant to speak of a "day after."  The assessments 
we provided in ref cables are still valid, and we will update as 
events warrant.
