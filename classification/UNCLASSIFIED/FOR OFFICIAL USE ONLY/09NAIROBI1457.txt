Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, Post submits the following update for 
the first week of July 2009.  End summary. 
 
------------- 
PD Activities 
------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Somalia Unit, including the Military Information 
Support Team (MIST) dedicated to Somalia, performed para. 3-7 
activities since the last report: 
 
¶3. (SBU) Somalia Unit supported Assistant Secretary Carson's 
July 4 press conference in Nairobi, which focused heavily on 
Somalia.  International, Kenyan, and Somali press attended. 
In addition to press reaction in ref A, media reaction 
reporting has been forwarded via ref B email. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post continued preparing the two selected Somali 
journalists to accompany the Transitional Federal 
Government's (TFG) Minister of Information to Mogadishu for 
an extended assessment of all aspects of the TFG's 
media/public affairs operation.  PAO coordinated an 
introductory meeting between the two assessors and the 
Minister of Information in Nairobi on July 2.  In addition to 
the procurement process, we continue working with the 
assessors to ensure they understand the expectations for the 
assessment mission. 
 
¶5. (SBU) We continued to coordinate the installation and use 
of the AF/RSA-procured FM radio transmitter slated to arrive 
in Somalia in late July or early August.  As the United 
Nations has concurrently procured a transmitter package, we 
are working to determine if the U.S. transmitter can be a 
complementary addition or might better be used to boost the 
capacity of TFG-owned Radio Mogadishu. 
 
¶6. (SBU) MIST activity, week of June 29: MIST continued to 
broadcast Islamic outreach messages by Sheikh Bundid on Star 
FM in Northeast Kenya and Nairobi as well as a discussion 
forum promoting reconciliation in Mogadishu on Radio Simba. 
 
¶7. (SBU) MIST activity, week of June 29 (cont.): Statements 
of Work (SOWs) were sent forward to European command (EUCOM) 
for contracting for the continuation and expansion of the 
current Somalia program.  The team is confirming funding 
before moving forward with remaining contracting for the 
fourth quarter of FY09.
