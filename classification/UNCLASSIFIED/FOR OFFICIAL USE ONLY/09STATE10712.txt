¶1. (U) The Department has reviewed its files and finds that

human rights at this time by the members of the Iraqi 
Security Forces listed below.  Department strongly suggests 
that visa applications for these individuals be filed with as 
much time as possible to allow for additional processing 
procedures that may be required.  Note that if, at any time,

incidents which could be deemed to be credible information of 
a gross violation of human rights by these individuals, the 
Embassy should so inform the Department.
