SUBJECT:  MGEAP1: WEST SUMATRA EARTHQUAKE - SITREP 5 
 
Reftel:  Jakarta 01654 and previous. 
 
1.(U)  The following information is current as of Monday, October 5, 
1500 hours, local time. 
 
CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND 
 
2.(U)  As a result of heavy rains, the GOI had to stop activities in 
Padang for three hours this morning.  The GOI is aware of the dire 
need to get into the surrounding areas, but landslides have made it 
nearly impossible to get assistance teams there.  Electricity has 
been restored to approximately 20 percent of Padang, and the power 
company expects to have it fully restored by week's end.  Area 
hospitals are beginning to receive supplies but patients continue to 
sleep in tents because the buildings are severely damaged. 
Sixty-five percent of the mobile phone network has been restored. 
The area near the port remained relatively undamaged so food stalls, 
small restaurants and local markets in that area are open.  The 
central market remains closed and there are reports of rapidly 
rising food prices. 
 
 
DEATHS AND INJURIES 
 
3.(U)  In line with SAR teams' expectations, the most recent 
official figures for dead and injured has increased from reftel 
report.  As the rescue effort widens to include the outlying areas, 
these numbers will rise possibly into the thousands.  608 people are 
listed as dead; 897 as lightly injured; 596 as seriously injured; 
and 343 as missing. 
 
 
CONSULAR MATTERS 
 
4.(U)  Jakarta/CONS has accounted for all registered Americans 
presumed to have been in the earthquake zone.  We made contact via 
telephone, SMS, email and walkabout to Amcits' registered 
residences, and hospitals, hotels and morgues in Padang.  We 
communicated with known addresses of Amcits' interested parties who 
are outside the Padang area, including in the United States.  Based 
on our on-site evaluation and the lack of relevant communications 
with interested parties, we continue to believe that no/no Americans 
are in physical distress, killed or injured, or remain in harm's way 
as a result of the earthquake.  Conoff in Padang tracked down and 
spoke with the manager of the collapsed Ambacang Hotel, and reviewed 
its guest register.  Most of the casualties are Indonesian; none 
were registered as U.S. passport holders.  We are closing the loop 
on a few inquiries of Amcits who we understand are out of the area. 
Jakarta's remaining Conoff in Padang returns to Jakarta on 6 Oct, 
and Medan officers TDY in Padang will take over Amcit issues, if any 
arise.  Jakarta/CONS will add to future sitreps only if a CONS issue 
arises. 
 
 
USG ASSISTANCE - USAID 
 
5.(U)  We continue to work with the Indonesian authorities, civilian 
and military, to ensure that our assistance addresses the needs that 
the GOI has identified as quickly and efficiently as possible.  An 
11-person DART team arrived in Jakarta on Sunday, October 3 and six 
of its members have arrived in Padang.  Also on October 3, USAID 
provided Mercy Corps International with a USD300,000 grant.  As 
reported reftel, Mercy Corps will focus on providing shelter, water 
materials and medical supplies.  On Tuesday, October 6, a flight of 
USAID/OFDA relief commodities from Dubai, including hygiene kits, 
power generators, water containers, and plastic sheeting is 
scheduled to arrive in Padang.  Additional details will be provided 
by DART Info Officer, Diedra Spencer septel. 
 
USG ASSISTANCE - DOD 
 
6.(U)  The Secretary of Defense authorized $7 million for 
relief operations in Indonesia.  The morning of October 3 Admiral 
Landholt and other members of the HAST team arrived in Jakarta and 
then traveled to Padang in the afternoon.  The Admiral met with PO 
Stan Harsha and GOI officials to arrange for the delivery and set up 
of the field hospital, as well as to discuss other assistance.  The 
USS McCampbell and the USNS Richard E. Byrd will join the USS Denver 
in logistics support operations.  The U.S. Department of Defense 
(DoD) is airlifting a Humanitarian Assistance Rapid Response Team 
(HARRT) to Padang, with a scheduled arrival date of October 5. The 
HARRT will provide medical treatment for between 200 and 250 
patients per day. 
7.(U)  NGOs are aware of our C-130 flights between Jakarta and 
Padang and have sought our assistance in delivering badly needed 
materials.  For instance, HOPE will send locally purchased medicines 
and shelter to its mobile medical team which is working in the 
Pariaman district (outside of Padang). 
 
8.(SBU)  Hatta Rajsa, State Secretary of the United Indonesia 
Cabinet, expressed gratitude for a U.S. military field hospital and 
the USS Denver's airlift support.  He said imagery from P-3 flights 
would help the government's damage assessment and inquired about 
heavy equipment for excavation and well drilling.  Helicopter 
airlift capacity will get humanitarian assistance and maybe heavy 
equipment to hard to access areas. 
 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
 
9.(U)  The UNOCHA is acting as the lead coordinator of international 
aid.  OCHA is conducting assessment of requirements with its network 
of NGOs and GOI.  Preliminary results are expected Tuesday, October 
¶6.  We have confirmed reports of the following governments/NGOs 
having provided assistance and/or funds: JICA (Japan) medical aid 
and rescue team; AusAid Australia search and rescue team; Insarac 
(Swiss) medical aid and rescue team; Turkey humanitarian aid; Church 
World Services; European Commission; Malaysia; UNDP; Hope Indonesia 
and IOM.  We have unconfirmed reports that there are 72 
international NGOs working in the area. 
 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS 
 
10.(U)  Charge Osius and RDML Landolt will travel to Padang tomorrow 
to welcome the OFDA plane and to see the set up of the mobile 
hospital, as well as support and thank our team. The Indonesian 
press, print and television, continues to report on President 
Obama's phone call to President Yudhoyono.  U.S. offers of 
assistance have been widely reported.  A popular newspaper, Rakyat 
Merdeka, included CG Medan and USAID in its list of volunteers 
actually on the ground in Padang.
