¶1. (SBU) Summary: Sudanese rebel leaders Adam Shogar, Gamal 
Addine Ibrahim, Tadjadine Bechin Niam and Sharif Harir told 
Ambassador on March 9 that the proposed SLM rebel conference 
should occur soon, but funding for transportation and 
logistics is needed.  Shogar reiterated that a unified SLM/A 
position must be achieved before any rebel conference can 
occur.  The recent Tripoli conference was also discussed. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Adam Shogar and Gamal Addine Ibrahim briefed the 
Ambassador and EmbOffs on the latest developments in the 
proposed SLM/A conference.  Shogar laid out his vision for 
Darfur rebel unity, with the SLM/A conference "preparing the 
way" for the National Redemption Front (NRF) conference. 
Shogar told Ambassador that "most" commanders intend to 
participate in the SLM/A conference, including Sharif Harir, 
Ahmed Abdul Shafi and Adam Bakhit.  However, Shogar said that 
Abdulwahid Nur and Minni Minawi and his followers would not 
participate.  In response to a question from the Ambassador, 
Shogar noted that Ahmed Diraige would not participate in the 
conference either, because he was not a SLM/A member.  He 
requested USG assistance in transporting the commanders to 
the event site (Note: No site was proposed. End Note) and 
resolving other logistical problems.  In addition, he 
mentioned that his rebels lack access to adequate health care. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ambassador said that he would relay Shogar,s 
request to the Department, but stressed that the U.S. 
endorses the AU/UN initiative to facilitate a commanders 
conference and we hope the SLM/A will cooperate in this 
effort.  We are prepared to do what we can to see the 
conference realized soon.  Shogar responded that the 
reputation of the AU was so poor that many rebels did not 
want to work under AU auspices.  NRF will deal with the UN, 
but wants a new AU facilitation team (i.e., to get rid of 
those involved in the Abuja negotiations).  Sharif Harir said 
that they had to accept the AU as "a fact of life," but they 
had no confidence in it after Abuja. 
 
¶4. (SBU) As some rebel leaders had just returned from the 
Tripoli conference, Ambassador asked what role the Libyans 
and Eritreans play in the peace process.  (Note: Shogar told 
us that Khalil was still in Tripoli. End Note) Shogar said 
that he did not attend the Tripoli conference but that a 
clear conclusion was that rebel groups needed to unify first 
in order to engage Sudan in meaningful negotiations.  Shogar 
commented that he does not trust Libya ) despite Libya,s 
offer of medical assistance to his fighters ) and believes 
that Tripoli wants a peace settlement that favors the Bashir 
regime. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: These visits reaffirm Reftel A conclusions 
on the enormous obstacles ahead for the commander's 
conference. 
 
¶6. (U) Tripoli minimize considered.
