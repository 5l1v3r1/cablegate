(Begin text) 
 
To: The Embassy of the United States of America in the Sudan, 
Khartoum, Sudan 
 
Subject:  Violation of Cease Fire and displacement Of Civilians in 
Dar Fur 
 
The Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) presents its compliments 
to the Embassy of the United States in Sudan and would like to draw 
its attention on the ongoing violations of the Cease-fire and 
atrocities against the civilians being committed by the Janjaweed 
Militia in the areas of - Al Atmoud Al Akhdar, Juikhin, 
Legebeda,...etc, in south Darfur and the displaced people (mostly 
women and children) who are now grouped in Elebo village in the 
South-west of Buram and in Umkhairan.  In addition to that 
atrocities are also taking place in Jabal Moun Area of West Darfur. 
 
The Janjaweed militias are engaged through last week in killing, 
burning, destroying and looting of villages and properties in the 
above places and left more than 8000 people displaced in miserable 
conditions particularly in south Dar fur namely in Elebo and 
Umkhairan, among them many are seriously wounded and in need of 
immediate treatment. 
 
In this regard the SLA like to inform you that it has repeatedly 
approached the GOS and asked them to take responsiblities lies upon 
them in accordance with the DPA provision but have taken no action. 
 
The SLM/A while informing your office as the United being member of 
the Joint Commission asks your office to approach stakeholders for 
immediate and necessary actions to be taken in addressing the plight 
of these displaced people who are in desperate need for protection, 
food and shelter deliverance, evacuation and medical treatment. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
 
(signed) 
 
Minni Arkou Minawi 
Senior Assistant to the President and, 
Chairman of the SLM/A

¶3. (SBU) Comment:  the letter reflects increasing SLM/A frustration 
with ongoing ceasefire violations and Janjaweed predations, without 
demonstrable evidence of Janjaweed disarmament.  The SLM/A is 
understandably disappointed with continuing raids, which manage to 
remain below the world's radar.  End comment.
