¶2. (U) On May 2, Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Mitoji 
Yabunaka presented to ASEAN Secretary General Mr. Ong Keng 
Yong a list of items for ASEAN's use in case of a pandemic. 
They included 500,000 courses of Tamiflu and 700,000 sets of 
personal protective equipment (PPE), which will be 
stockpiled in Singapore.  The project is part of an 
initiative Prime Minister Koizumi unveiled at the last ASEAN- 
Japan Summit meeting held in December 2005, when Japan 
announced plans to contribute 7.5 billion yen (USD 70.1 
million) to help with ASEAN integration.  According to a 
Japanese Embassy press release, a new Japan-ASEAN 
Integration Fund (JAIF), officially launched on March 27, 
2006, will finance the stockpiling of these items, which 
should be completed within a few months.
