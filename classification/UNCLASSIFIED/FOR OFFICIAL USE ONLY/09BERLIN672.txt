SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On June 5, the National Reference Center for 
Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in its 
press briefing eleven new laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 
in Germany.  This increases the total number of confirmed 
cases to forty-nine (Refs B-E).  According to the institute, 
ten of the infections occurred in the US and one was a case of 
human-to-human transmission in Germany.  The new cases were 
distributed among the federal states as follows: Hesse (2), 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (3), Lower Saxony (1), Thuringia (2), 
Rhineland-Palatinate (1) and Bavaria (2). 
 
 
First Infections in Rhineland-Palatinate and Lower Saxony 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶3. (SBU)  RKI reported on June 5 the first infections in the 
federal states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Lower Saxony.  The 
Health Ministry in Lower Saxony confirmed the virus in a 4- 
year old boy who returned from a trip to the US with his 
family.  He showed flu-like symptoms and was treated at a 
hospital. Media reports indicate that he is now at home where 
he and his family are in quarantine.  A 4-year old girl from 
Rhineland-Palatinate was also confirmed to have the flu. 
Media reports indicate that the girl returned from a trip to 
the US with her family with fever and cold symptoms.  Health 
officials report that in both cases the course of the flu is 
mild.

¶4. (SBU)  In 30 of the 49 (total, to date) cases, the 
infection occurred in the US, nine cases occurred in Mexico, 
and one in England. Nine of the infections were transmitted 
among five families of Germans who returned from travel, at a 
hospital and the airport.
