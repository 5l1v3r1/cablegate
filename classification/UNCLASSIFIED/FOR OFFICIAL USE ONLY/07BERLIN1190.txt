SUBJECT: GERMANY - MFA RESPONSE TO 2007 TIP REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 71163 
 
¶1. (U) CONTAINS REQUEST FOR ACTION -- PLEASE SEE PARA 6. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Emboffs delivered demarche contained in ref and 
passed an advance copy of the 2007 Trafficking in Persons 
(TIP) Report country narrative for Germany to Axel Kuechle, 
MFA Deputy Director for International Cooperation against 
Organized Crime, Narcotics, Corruption, and Human 
Trafficking, on June 11.  Kuechle agreed with the report's 
overall positive assessment of Germany's steps to combat TIP 
and expressed appreciation for the report's recognition of 
German efforts during the June-July 2006 Soccer World Cup 
championship. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Noting the report's recommendation that Germany 
explore ways to increase prison sentences for convicted 
traffickers, Kuechle said he had experienced similar 
frustration with German sentencing practices in organized 
crime and narcotics cases.  German judges, Kuechle stated, 
tend towards leniency in cases involving first-time 
offenders, regardless of the charge.  He also said 
prosecutors have a hard time making trafficking charges 
stick, due to the statute's requirement that prosecutors 
prove direct involvement in the coercion or exploitation of 
the victim.  As a result, prosecutors generally bring 
trafficking charges against low-level "facilitators" and 
charge ringleaders with other crimes that carry similar 
sentences, but are easier to prove in court. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Kuechle asked if the Embassy could provide more 
information about U.S. efforts to educate and sensitize 
judges in the United States on TIP.  He also inquired whether 
the USG maintains statistics on cases where suspected 
traffickers have been convicted and sentenced on other 
charges and, if so, what methods the USG uses to do so. 
Referring to the October 2006 visit of U.S. Department of 
Justice TIP experts to Germany, Kuechle expressed interest in 
more bilateral exchanges at the expert level.  He agreed more 
discussion of TIP between high-ranking German and U.S. 
officials would be helpful.  Emboff noted Undersecretary 
Dobriansky and German Family Minister Ursula von der Leyen -- 
the Family Ministry has lead responsibility within the German 
Federal Government on TIP -- have agreed to discuss TIP on 
the margins of the June 14 Global Women's Summit in Berlin. 
 
¶5. (U) Following the report's public release on June 12, post 
will reach out to key contacts in the Family Ministry, 
Interior Ministry, and Justice Ministry to discuss German 
efforts and convey concerns raised in the report. 
 
¶6. (U) ACTION REQUEST: Post requests G/TIP assistance in 
obtaining more information we can share with German partners 
about USG efforts to educate and sensitize judges in the 
United States and, if available, examples of training 
materials.  In addition, post would appreciate the most 
recent U.S. TIP conviction and sentencing statistics, as well 
as information about how the USG tracks TIP-related 
convictions.
