¶1. (SBU) As anticipated in ref A, Argentine Special 
Prosecutor Alberto Nisman obtained from federal judge Rodolfo 
Canicoba-Corral an order for the attachment of real estate 
property in Buenos Aires province allegedly belonging to 
former Iranian Embassy Cultural Attache in Argentina Mohsen 
Rabbani, one of six Iranian suspects sought by Interpol at 
Argentina's request for participation in the 1994 bombing of 
the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA). 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to the press, the suburban properties are 
located outside Buenos Aires city limits, four in Canuelas 
and one in Ciudadela.  "Clarin" reported that the latter 
property had been used by a pro-Iranian radio station, FM 
90.7, "Casa para la difusion del Islam" ("Islam Broadcast 
House"). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Judge Canicoba ordered the attachment in the context 
of a civil suit brought by an unnamed survivor of the AMIA 
attack represented by attorney Pablo Jacoby, who is seeking 
one million dollars in damages from Iran, Hizballah, and the 
individuals charged in the criminal case.  On the basis of a 
determination by prosecutor Nisman that found Iran and 
Hizballah shared responsibility for the consequences of the 
AMIA attack, Judge Canicoba had in 2008 ordered the 
attachment of assets belonging to Hizballah, former Iranian 
president Rafsanjani, former Iranian information minister Ali 
Fallahijan, former foreign minister Ali Velayati, former 
ambassador Hadi Soleimanpour, former Revolutionary Guard 
commander Moshen Rezahi, former "Al Quds" chief Ahmad Vahidi, 
former Iranian embassy officer Ahmad Ashgari and Rabbani. 
 
¶4. (SBU) At a March 5 meeting with Legat, Nisman explained 
that Judge Canicoba-Corral authorized him to conduct further 
investigations to identify assets (real estate and money) 
belonging to the accused, and further authorized the freezing 
of their assets, both in Argentina and Europe.  However, a 
civil court judge will have to handle the forfeiture of these 
assets at a later time, and Nisman will not be part of that 
action. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Regarding the European accounts (ref B, para 3), 
Nisman acknowledged that France and Germany had the banks in 
their jurisdiction with the judicial orders, signed by Judge 
Canicoba-Corral, but said he had not received official notice 
that the banks had actually frozen the accounts.
