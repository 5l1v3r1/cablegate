SUBJECT: FINLAND WELCOMES MORE, BUT NOT ALL, VOICES IN 
ARCTIC COUNCIL 
 
(SBU) 1. In an August 20 meeting with Pol/Econ Officers, 
Ministry of Environment Director General (International 
Affairs Unit) Jukka Uosukainen shared Finland's interest in 
expanding discussion within the Arctic Council on key topics. 
 Specifically, the Finnish Government (GOF) believes that all 
Council discussions should include the eight permanent 
members rather than only the five members with Arctic 
territorial claims.  However, regarding others interested in 
a greater role or voice in the Arctic Council, the GOF 
remains quite cautious. 
 
(SBU) 2. The GOF feels the European Union (EU) also has an 
important role to play in the Arctic Council. Uosukainen is 
aware of the concerns of other members regarding Permanent 
Observer status for the EU, e.g., Canada's concerns about the 
EU's recent ban on seal hunting.   He also acknowledged that 
accepting the EU as a Permanent Observer could affect the 
political dynamic of the Council, and expressed the GOF's own 
concerns about the influence of larger EU members 
(geographically distant from the Arctic) in Arctic Council 
discussions.  Finland remains interested in finding an 
official status for the EU that suits all Arctic Council 
members. 
 
(SBU) 3. Finland is less enthusiastic about other nations - 
particularly China - receiving permanent observer status. 
China, Italy and South Korea currently hold ad-hoc observer 
status allowing them to sit in as observers on select Arctic 
Council meetings.  The GOF is concerned that their commercial 
interests in the Arctic are not aligned with the Arctic 
Council's larger mandate to protect the Arctic environment 
and its indigenous populations. 
 
(SBU) 4. COMMENT: The GOF's policy in the Arctic region to 
date has been environmental protection and support for the 
needs of the Arctic's indigenous populations.  However, 
Finland is also pragmatically considering its own commercial 
interests.  As the Arctic opens up, Finland sees 
opportunities in new shipping lanes and increased icebreaker 
services.    Although their support for Arctic environmental 
protection will remain strong, new commercial interests may 
also influence their views on the Arctic Council's future 
mandate and composition.  END COMMENT.
