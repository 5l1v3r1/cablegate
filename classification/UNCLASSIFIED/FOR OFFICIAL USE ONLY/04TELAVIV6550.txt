¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Israeli Ministry of Environment officials 
hope to work closely with the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency to make progress on some of Israel's most challenging 
environment problems.  Those include:  asbestos and 
hazardous waste cleanups, emergency preparedness, water 
security, and coastal management.  MoE is prepared to 
discuss funding arrangements with EPA.  Israel has new 
legislation on coastal management and the handling of 
biosolids.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) NEA Senior S&T Advisor Charles Lawson, accompanied 
by ESTH Officer, met December 6 with MoE Director General 
Miki Haran, Senior Deputy DG for Policy and Planning Valerie 
Brachya, and International Relations Director Ori Livne. 
Those officials stated that they would like to draw on the 
EPA's experience and expertise to help address some of 
Israel's toughest environmental problems. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The MoE officials identified the following areas 
for potential cooperation with the EPA: 
 
-- Asbestos Cleanups:  Israel is facing both "tear-downs and 
tear-outs," is looking to "train trainers," and could use 
assistance in certifying asbestos inspectors. 
 
-- Emergency Preparedness and First Responder Planning and 
Training:  MoE has made a lot of progress on responding to 
hazardous substances incidents, including marine-related 
incidents, but would welcome the opportunity to compare 
experiences with the EPA. 
 
-- Hazardous Waste Handling:  The cleanup effort at the 
Ramat Hovav hazardous waste disposal site in the Negev is 
proceeding, but there is much more to be done.  The effort 
generates its own cash flow as companies looking to dispose 
of hazardous wastes are charged according to a set fee 
structure.  Related international tenders will be made 
public "soon." 
 
-- Water Security:  The MoE is interested in comparing 
experiences with EPA on water supply security and other 
homeland security areas in which the EPA has involvement. 
 
-- Coastal Management:  MoE officials are interested in U.S. 
policymaking related to coastal erosion. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The MoE officials noted that Israel is moving 
forward to implement new legislation to protect the 
environment, including a coastal management law and another 
on the handling of biosolids.  The latter will go into 
effect over the next two years, under the guidance of a 
committee with representatives from the Water Commission and 
the Ministries of Health, Agriculture, and Environment.  One 
aim will be to treat all water to a minimum level 
appropriate for agricultural use.  Higher treatment 
standards will add a few cents per cubic meter to the cost 
of water.  The GOI is moving towards decisions on new 
treatment standards, including for removal of salt and brine 
at the water source.  On coastal management, a key concern 
is erosion due to decreases in the amount of sand carried up 
the coast by prevailing currents. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  As DG Haran noted, environmental 
consciousness is becoming more popular, both among the 
public and politicians.  The Knesset Environmental Caucus is 
now a strong group, with multi-party representation, she 
said.  MoE staff "used to be seen as extremists," but are 
now in the middle.  Green groups are learning they can get 
more traction by linking environmental and social issues, 
e.g. public use of open spaces.  In this period of new 
momentum to protect the environment, MoE is eager to take 
advantage of EPA's deep experience with the tough cleanup 
challenges Israel is facing.   International Relations 
Director Livne said that the Ministry could make funding 
available to support work by EPA to help Israel solve key 
environmental problems like asbestos and hazardous waste 
cleanups, including by drawing from waste-handling fees 
charged to firms for the disposition of hazardous wastes. 
Livne commented that in some areas, especially hazardous 
waste disposal, "Israel definitely needs help and can't do 
it alone."
