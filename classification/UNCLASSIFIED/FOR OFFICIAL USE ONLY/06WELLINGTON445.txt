SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND EXPANDS ITS CHANCERY IN VANUATU FOR 
GROWING AID PROGRAM 
 
REF: IIR 6 869 0072 06 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 7, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston 
Peters opened new, larger offices for the New Zealand High 
Commission in Port Vila, Vanuatu.  On June 8, Poloff spoke 
with New Zealand's High Commissioner to Vanuatu, Paul Willis, 
who said the Commission had leased one-and-half floors of new 
office space to accommodate growth in staff for its 
significantly expanding NZAID development assistance program, 
staff for additional diplomatic and consular activities, 
additional space to receive visitors and GNZ delegations, and 
to accommodate any future growth of other government 
agencies.  New Zealand established diplomatic relations with 
Vanuatu in 1987, Willis said. 
 
¶2. (U) While New Zealand's development assistance for Vanuatu 
averaged USD 3.4 million (NZD 5.4 million) per year over the 
five-year period from FY2001 to FY2005, the allocation for 
this fiscal year rose to USD 4.6 million (NZD 7.25 million) 
and will rise progressively to USD 10.4 million (NZD 16.5 
million) in FY2008, according a five-year strategy agreed to 
during March 2005 consultations between New Zealand and 
Vanuatu.  The increased ODA allocation will build on existing 
programs in education and human resource development (50 
percent), strengthening governance (30 percent), and 
improving prospects for sustained economic development (20 
percent).
