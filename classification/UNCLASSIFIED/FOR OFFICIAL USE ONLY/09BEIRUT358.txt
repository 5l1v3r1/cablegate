SUBJECT: LEBANON: FINMIN AGREES: USE USG CASH TRANSFER TO 
PAY WORLD BANK DEBT 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 3 
below. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a March 27 phone call with the Ambassador, 
Finance Minister Mohamad Chatah agreed that the USG use its 
$50 million cash transfer disbursement, which was triggered 
by GOL reform of its gas excise tax, to pay World Bank debt. 
Though Chatah was disappointed that Washington did not 
approve payment of higher-interest debt owed to other 
creditors, he said he did not want the disbursement to be a 
protracted process, and would instruct his staff to work with 
USAID and the World Bank in setting up the debt payment 
schedule.  He expressed his gratitude for USG assistance. 
 
¶3. (U) Post requests that USAID Cairo contact Finance 
Ministry contacts to proceed with the disbursement.
