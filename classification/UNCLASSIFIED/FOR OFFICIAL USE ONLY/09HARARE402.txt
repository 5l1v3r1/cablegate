SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The President of the MDC-M and Deputy Prime 
Minister, Arthur Mutambara, and other top party officials 
suspended six senior party members, including three MPs.  The 
suspensions have unearthed growing dissent within the MDC-M 
about Mutambara's leadership, which some party officials and 
party supporters feel has become too pro-ZANU-PF.  The 
suspended officials may ultimately be expelled, which would 
result in three parliamentary vacancies.  However, the 
displaced MPs could be expected to hold onto their seats by 
running as either independents or choosing to rejoin the 
ranks of the much larger MDC-T.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------- 
Suspensions Roil the MDC-M 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On May 8, the leadership of the MDC-Mutambara 
faction (MDC-M) suspended six senior officials from the 
party, including three sitting parliamentarians, on charges 
of bringing the party into disrepute.  The six officials had 
been openly critical of the party's leadership under Deputy 
Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara, charging him along with his 
deputies Welshman Ncube and Priscilla Misihairabwi-Mushonga 
of seconding the party's interests to those of ZANU-PF and 
President Mugabe.  The suspended officials include, Nkayi 
South MP Abednico Bhebhe, Bulilima East MP Norman Mpofu, 
Lupane East MP Njabuliso Mguni, party defense secretary Job 
Sikhala, youth chairman Gift Nyandoro, and Matabeleland South 
treasurer Alex Goosen.

Is He Really the Best Leader Africa has Produced? 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Bhebhe met with poloff and pol specialist on May 12 
and explained the origins and implications of the rift within 
the MDC-M.  According to Bhebhe, the issue first arose during 
the selection of the Speaker of Parliament, when Mutambara 
pressed MPs to support the candidacy of Paul Themba Nyathi of 
the MDC-M, in lieu of either Gibson Sibanda of the MDC-M or 
Lovemore Moyo of the MDC-T.  Recognizing that they did not 
have the votes to elect their own candidate, ZANU-PF also 
backed Nyathi, but eight of the ten MDC-M MPs did not want to 
be seen on the same side as ZANU-PF and bucked Mutambara by 
voting for Moyo.  The bad blood this created was exacerbated 
by controversial and inflammatory statements by Mutambara, 
including referring to President Obama's decision to extend 
sanctions as being "based on ignorance and arrogance," saying 
that "the West needs to shut up," and most recently referring 
to Mugabe as "father Africa" and "the best leader Africa has 
produced." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Bhebhe believed that Mutambara in particular, but 
also Ncube and Misihairabwi-Mushonga, had grown too close to 
Mugabe and had become indirect agents of ZANU-PF.  He also 
described Mutambara's leadership style as being authoritative 
and reminiscent of Mugabe.  While addressing several recent 
Qand reminiscent of Mugabe.  While addressing several recent 
rallies designed to raise doubts about Mutambara's 
allegiances, Bhebhe said that people had demanded to know why 
they had been told to support Mutambara if he was not going 
to act as an opposition figure.  Bhebhe said that many of the 
MDC-M supporters he had spoken with were shocked in 
particular by Mutambara's complimenting of Mugabe.

Three Seats at Stake

-------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) When asked what parliamentary implications the 
suspensions hold for the three sitting MPs, Bhebhe explained 
that there will be an inquiry held by the party's 
disciplinary committee that will likely result in a 
recommendation to the MDC-M National Council to expel the six 
members.  If the National Council agreed with the 
recommendation -- as Bhebhe seemed to believe would happen -- 
a letter would be written to the Speaker of Parliament 
stating that the three MPs were no longer members of the 
MDC-M.  As seats in Parliament belong to the party not 
individuals, this would vacate the seats.  However, according 
to last September's Inter-party Political Agreement (IPA), 
within the first 12 months of the formation of a new 
government the three parties agreed not to contest any 
parliamentary vacancy.  Bhebhe said that because the IPA was 
only binding on the three signatory parties, it would not 
preclude him or the other two MPs from running as 
independents.  He was confident that he would win a 
bi-election as an independent.  Alternatively, if his 
expulsion occurred after February 13, 2010, he would likely 
rejoin the MDC-T and run under their banner.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Bhebhe and Sikhala are the ringleaders of a group 
of MDC-M officials who have had enough of Mutambara's 
reckless and inconsistent behavior.  Mutambara fluctuates 
between appearing to be a determined reformer one moment, to 
then ingratiating himself to Mugabe and ZANU-PF leaders the 
next.  While this has alienated him from much of his party, 
he has emerged as a force in Cabinet and principal meetings, 
largely overshadowing the other Deputy Prime Minister, 
Thokozani Khupe.  Because Mutambara lacks a political base -- 
he failed to win a seat in parliament last year -- he is 
trying to elevate his profile and find allies. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Within Parliament we do not believe the shake-up 
will have wide-ranging implications.  If the three MDC-M MPs 
are expelled, they will probably run as independents, as only 
the MDC-M could challenge them within the next nine months. 
Given this, it is unlikely that they would be displaced. 
After nine months, they would likely be welcomed back into 
the ranks of the MDC-T.  END COMMENT.
