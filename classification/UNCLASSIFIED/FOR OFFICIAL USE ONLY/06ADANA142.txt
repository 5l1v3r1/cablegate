HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE OPENING ADDRESSES 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) In their opening addresses, the chairmen of Gaziantep 
Chambers of Industry and Commerce emphasized their hopes that 
the fair would develop economic relations between Turkey and 
Iraq, and asserted that Turks and Iraqis were the real owners of 
the Middle East.  The speakers emphasized Gaziantep's pioneering 
role in developing these regional trade relations.  Iraqi 
Commercial Counselor Adnan Al-Sharif pointed out that foreign 
investors had doubts about investing in Iraq because of the 
turmoil in that country, but he assured listeners that the 
north, south and middle parts of the country were safe.  Iraqi 
Cultural Counselor Jaber Al Jabiri praised Turkey's democratic 
progress, and asserted that Iraq and other countries neighboring 
Turkey would like to follow Turkey's democratic example. Turkish 
State Minister in charge of Foreign Trade Kursat Tuzmen said 
that the fair organizers planned to hold the fair in Gaziantep 
every year, and hoped that Gaziantep could play a more active 
role in international trade in the region.

at the fair. The Turkish-French Trade Association, and the 
Turkish-Italian Chamber had booths at the fair. According to the 
organizers, a total of 65,000 people visited the fairgrounds 
during the event; 11,000 people from other cities in Turkey, and 
7,000 people from Iraq, Syria, and other countries.

INCREASED TRADE WITH THE REGION 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The Iraqi International Fair can be seen as the latest 
expression of Turkey's efforts within its strategy since the 
early 2000's to increase trade with surrounding countries.  As 
part of this strategy, Turkey specifically hopes to take 
advantage of Iraq's high rate of demand for nearly all kinds of 
goods and services to increase its exports with Iraq. 
 
¶6. (U) Fair organizers did not anticipate that the fair would 
bring a rise in exports in the short term. Nevertheless, 
Gaziantep companies are reportedly optimistic that the fair may 
help create gradual growth in trade between Turkey and Iraq, as 
well as other neighboring countries. On the other hand, a group 
of businessmen from Adana's textile sector who visited the fair 
complained that they were unable to meet any Iraqi companies. 
During a visit on the second day of the fair, Iraqi Minister of 
Commerce Abdulfarah El Sudany explained that Iraqi companies' 
and ministries' plans were still at the early stages of 
preparation, and indicated that he expected greater 
participation by Iraqi companies in the future. The Gaziantep 
Chamber of Industry announced that it hoped to see the fair held 
in Gaziantep next year, and that the Chamber was hoping to see a 
rise in the percentage of Gaziantep`s exports to its neighbors 
of up to 50 percent.
