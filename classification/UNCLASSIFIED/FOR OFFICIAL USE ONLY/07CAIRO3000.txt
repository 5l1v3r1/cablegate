¶1. (SBU) Tensions between the Fawakhreya tribe, which is 
based in the city of el-Arish in North Sinai, and the 
Tarabeen bedouin tribe intensified on October 6 when a 
Tarabeen member opened fire on residents and buildings in the 
Fawakhreya neighborhood, according to press accounts and 
Embassy contacts.  The shooting incited protests by 
Fawakhreya tribe members, who vandalized the local National 
Democratic Party (NDP) headquarters as well as pictures of 
President Mubarak.  Members of the Fawakhreya tribe accused 
government security forces of failing to maintain security. 
(Note: Although the Fawakhreya tribe is the largest tribe in 
the region, Embassy contacts say its 35,000 members are less 
well armed than members of some bedouin tribes and are more 
dependent on government security for their protection. End 
note.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) To control the protests, the Minister of Interior 
ordered security forces to enforce a curfew on the Fawakhreya 
neighborhood of el-Arish on October 6. Several demonstrators 
were injured and hospitalized, although none were killed. 
According to North Sinai business and security contacts, the 
GOE lifted the curfew on October 8 after calm had been 
restored.  Embassy contacts speculate that North Sinai MPs 
and Fawakhreya tribe members will demand to be armed to 
counter future attacks. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment: The supposed demand for weapons is based 
on the GOE practice in Sinai to acquiesce to a small degree 
of judicial autonomy for the bedouin tribes.  Although the 
GOE will not provide weapons to feuding tribes, the tension 
in the area is likely to continue.
