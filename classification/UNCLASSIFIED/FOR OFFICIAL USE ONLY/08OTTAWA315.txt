(sbu) Post delivered reftel Preliminary Threat Assessment 
regarding cash couriers to Mark Moher, Senior Coordinator for 
International Crime and Terrorism at the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade on February 28. 
Moher told Econcouns that he looked forward to reading the 
non-paper and to further dialogue with the USG.  He added 
that Canada wants to be helpful on the cash courier issue, 
but it has "no clear evidence as to what magnitude" terrorist 
entities use cash couriers.  Moher said Canada would welcome 
any USG information that would show this to be an "severe and 
urgent" matter.
