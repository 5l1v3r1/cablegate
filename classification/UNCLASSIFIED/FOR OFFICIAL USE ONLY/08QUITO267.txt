¶1.  Summary.  Ecuador's inflation rose in the first two months of 
2008 due in large part natural disasters, namely severe flooding and 
a volcanic eruption.  Additionally, rising global inflationary 
pressure, particularly for food, contributed to Ecuador's 
inflationary up-tick.  However, Ecuador's medium- to long-term 
inflation outlook appears stable, although salary increases and 
rising government expenditure could generate inflationary pressure. 
End Summary. 
 
Short Term Inflation Rise Due to Local Disasters 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. (U) Inflation rose significantly in the first two months of 2008 
compared to 2007.  Inflation rose 1.14 percent in January 2008, the 
highest monthly increase in five years. Inflation rose 0.94 percent 
in February 2008 compared to 0.07 percent in February 2007. 
Annualized inflation through January 2008 was 4.19 percent, compared 
to 2.68 percent in the same period a year earlier. 
 
¶3. (U) The eruptions of Tungurahua volcano in late January and early 
February affected agricultural production and distribution in the 
volcano's vicinity.  Potato production was most significantly 
affected, with prices rising 3.8 percent in February 2008. 
 
¶4. (U) Mass flooding throughout Ecuador in February harmed 
agricultural production, especially in coastal regions, and closed 
many transportation routes, thus hindering distribution (reftel a). 
This led to increased consumer prices nationwide.  The largest 
inflationary spikes were seen in food products and non-alcoholic 
drinks.  Prices in this group rose 0.52 percent in February 2008. 
Products with the highest increase were: tomatoes, 13.9 percent; 
fresh fish, 7.25 percent; and soft drinks, 3.8 percent. 
 
¶5.  (U) In addition to the weather and the volcanic eruption, two 
policy factors also contributed to inflation.  The minimum wage was 
increased by 15% in late 2007 and was effective at the beginning of 
¶2008.  In addition, the government implemented extensive tax reforms 
at the beginning of the year (reftels b and c), including raising 
excise taxes on ostensibly luxury goods (including cigarettes, 
make-up and cars), which led to price increases for those goods. 
 
Rising Global Inflationary Pressure 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Increasing global prices for commodities coupled with 
Ecuador's reliance on imported inputs have contributed to 
inflationary pressure on both consumer and producer prices since the 
middle of 2007.  The biggest increases in February in this category 
were whole chickens, 6.6 percent; and vegetable oil, 5.4 percent; 
chicken prices are heavily influenced by the cost of imported feeds 
and other inputs, while vegetable oil is imported.  Producer prices 
rose 1.89 percent in February 2008, raising the annual producer 
prices inflation rate to 9.36 percent.  With producer prices rising 
faster than consumer prices, this trend could put additional 
pressure on consumer prices. 
 
¶7.  (U) Rising petroleum prices have only a secondary impact on 
inflation in Ecuador, for example in the cost of plastic packaging 
material or international shipping costs.  However, the domestic 
prices of fuel products (gasoline, diesel, LPG) have been frozen for 
several years.  This policy, which predates the Correa 
administration, has become increasingly expensive for the 
government, which imports petroleum derivatives and subsidizes the 
difference. 
 
Long Term Inflation Outlook Appears Stable 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶7.  (U) At 3.3 percent, Ecuador's 2007 year-end inflation was the 
lowest in Latin America.  In spite of the unexpected short term up 
tick from natural disasters, Ecuadorian inflation in the beginning 
of 2008 remained on par relative to its regional neighbors.  In 
February 2008, Ecuador's inflation rate of 0.94 percent was lower 
than Colombia (1.51 percent) and equal to Peru (0.91 percent). 
 
¶8. (U) The Central Bank of Ecuador predicts inflation to rise 
between 2.9 and 3.7% in 2008.  Five-year predictions from the 
Economist Intelligence Unit predict Ecuadorian annual inflation 
rates between 3.4 and 4.5 percent through 2012. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) Since adopting the U.S. dollar in late 2000, inflation has 
been a bright spot in the Ecuadorian economy. Inflation rates have 
remained low both by regional and global standards.  Although 
Ecuador had the lowest inflation rate in 2007 in Latin America and 
the medium- to long-term inflation outlook appears stable, risks 
remain.  One is that short-term inflationary pressures remain from 
both the flooding and global price increases.  It remains to be seen 
whether the government will try to contain this inflationary 
pressure through market intervention, as it has already done for 
milk (price controls), flour (subsidies), and rice (export ban) 
(reftels d-f). 
 
¶12.  (SBU) In the medium-term, continued government spending and 
promises of more wage hikes in upcoming years could generate 
additional inflationary pressure, although those pressures appear to 
be contained for the time being because of Ecuador's sluggish 
economic growth.  Frozen fuel prices also represent suppressed 
inflation, which will be a problem when and if the government ever 
decides to adjust those prices.
