SUBJECT: SUDAN PRESIDENT BASHIR STRIKES A STRANGELY POSITIVE NOTE IN 
ADDRESS TO THE NATION 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY: Speaking on the occasion of the 19th anniversary of 
the National Salvation Revolution, Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir 
spoke to the nation from Omdurman July 6.  In what was widely seen 
as a inaugural campaign speech for the elections scheduled next year 
under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), Bashir maintained a 
highly positive tone, enumerating the economic and security 
achievements of his regime.  For the future, he promised to continue 
to implement the CPA, to seek peaceful resolution of conflict in 
"our beloved Darfur," and to work with all other political parties 
for national conciliation. END SUMMARY 
 
RUNNING ON HIS RECORD: ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Reeling off what he said were the achievements of the 
National Salvation Revolution, Bashir addressed mostly economics and 
development.  In the realm of national security, he said the 
Revolution had completed the process of securing national 
independence and sovereignty by rejecting interference by "hegemonic 
states." 
 
¶3.  Among the achievements Bashir claimed: development of the oil 
industry; expanding production of electricity and infrastructure, 
including the Merawi Dam; spurring the national economy to the point 
that it is now one of the largest recipients of investments, both 
from the Arab world and the world at large; laying the basis for a 
strong agricultural industry to close the food gap that is presently 
stalking the world.  In addition, the government has helped the 
country join the communications revolution, to the point, Bashir 
said, where Sudan leads the region.  It is developing the 
construction industry that will provide adequate housing for all 
citizens, with special emphasis on the needs of the poor. 
 
FUTURE OBJECTIVES: MORE SWEETNESS AND LIGHT 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Among the objectives that Bashir listed for the future are: 
 
-1) Continued commitment to the principles of a modern state based 
on science, faith, respect for human rights, rule of law, and 
respect for the peaceful transition of power; 
-2) Conducting free, fair and monitored elections as stipulated by 
the CPA and the interim national constitution; 
-3) Settlement of internal conflicts throughout the country, 
particularly in "our beloved Darfur," through peaceful dialogue; 
ending the suffering of the country's IDPs; 
-4) Work to implements peace accords signed in Nivasha, Abuja, Cairo 
and Asmara; 
-5) Speed up implementation of comprehensive health insurance, again 
with special attention to the poor. 
 
GOOD NEIGHBORS - OTHER PARTIES, OTHER COUNTRIES 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5) (U) Bashir pledged that Sudan would continue its good-neighbor 
policies of non-intervention, and would urge "some neighboring 
countries" (they know who they are) to respect those principles. 
The Government would continue to safeguard national security and 
sovereignty, and would not accept any infringements.  Finally, the 
President saluted all of Sudan's political parties, and said he 
hoped to meet with all of them to work towards national 
conciliation. 
 
6) (SBU) COMMENT: A far cry from his usual threatening "jihad" 
speeches, this was surely the most uniformly positive speech by 
Bashir that we can recall, and clearly seemed framed as an election 
campaign speech (in fact his advisors had told us that it would be a 
campaign speech).  Moreover, with the possibility of an ICC 
indictment looming, we suspect President Bashir may also hope to 
tantalize the international community with signs of what is 
possible.
