SUBJECT: KAZAKHSTAN: PRESIDENT SIGNALS SUPPORT FOR INVESTMENT IN 
AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1. (U) In an April 19 speech before the 6th Annual Eurasia Media 
Forum in Almaty, President Nursultan Nazarbayev declared that 
Kazakhstan and its Central Asian neighbors must take some 
responsibility for reconstructing Afghanistan, in part to help 
create a "belt of economic well-being" that would serve as a 
reliable barrier to international terrorists, religious extremists, 
drug traffickers, and illegal migration.  Nazarbayev noted that 
Kazakhstan has already shipped 3,000 tons of wheat to Afghanistan, 
as well as 85,000 tons of grain through the UN Global Food Program. 
The president also said that Kazakhstan is currently developing a 
"Special Action Program" to increase humanitarian and economic 
cooperation with Afghanistan and invest in the Afghan economy.  He 
announced that Kazakhstan plans to construct a school in the 
Samangan region and a hospital in the Bamian region, and will 
encourage Kazakhstani companies to enter the Afghan market. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On April 26, Talgat Shaldanbai, the desk officer at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs responsible for Afghan issues, confirmed 
to Poloff the ongoing development of a "Special Program to Support 
the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan."  Shaldanbai explained that the 
program is in the early drafting stage, but will eventually include 
cultural, humanitarian, investment, and economic support components, 
as well as plans for providing training and expertise to Afghan 
institutions.  Shaldanbai said that Kazakhstan was "80%" certain 
that it would build a school in Samangan, and was still working with 
the Government of Afghanistan on the possibility of building a 
hospital in the Bamian region. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  Although Kazakhstan's Special Action Program for 
Afghanistan remains in its very early stages, President Nazarbayev's 
public call for investment in Afghanistan signals a growing 
recognition that Central Asia's fate is linked to Afghanistan's 
fate.  Post will continue to encourage and support Kazakhstan's 
investment and reconstruction initiatives in Afghanistan.  End 
comment.
