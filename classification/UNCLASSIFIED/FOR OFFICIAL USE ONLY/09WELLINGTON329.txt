SUBJECT: DRAFT MOU ON LIFE, SECURITY AND MOBILITY SUPPORT DELIVERED 
IN NEW ZEALAND 
 
REF: 09 STATE 129187; KABUL 3981 
 
Per reftel, we delivered talking points and draft Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) on Life Security and Mobility Support to Senior 
Policy Analyst Joanna Heslop, New Zealand Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade's (MFAT) International Security and Disarmament 
Division.   Because MFAT essentially shuts down during the holiday 
season, other relevant senior officials were not available.  Heslop 
said her office will coordinate with the New Zealand Ministry of 
Defense Legal Affairs Division on a response to the MOU as soon as 
possible, but they would likely not have an answer until sometime 
after January 5 when MFAT reopens.  A courtesy copy of the MOU was 
provided to MFAT's Americas and Middle East Divisions.   We will 
follow up with the MFAT officials after January 5.
