SUBJECT:  SPLM Supports UN, Plans a Way Forward 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a meeting of the Sudan Peoples' Liberation Movement 
(SPLM) Political Bureau, held in Juba on September 14-16, the party 
announced its unconditional support for UN troops in Darfur and 
developed an eleven- point plan to move the process forward.  The 
plan includes meeting with all rebel parties, initiating a cessation 
of hostilities and traditional reconciliation process with the 
janjaweed, pushing the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue, and engaging with the 
U.S. to improve bilateral relations with Sudan. 
 
¶2. (SBU) While the meeting did not include the major cabinet 
shake-ups some expected, Foreign Minister Lam Akol was admonished 
for going against SPLM positions and publicly opposing UN 
intervention.  He was told to either follow party policy or remain 
silent.  Akol relented, but defended himself by claiming he did not 
have clear instructions from his party and that if the SPLM wanted 
to go against the policies of the ruling National Congress Party 
(NCP), it should resign from government.  Akol, State Minister for 
the Presidency Telar Deng, and State Minister for the Interior Aleu 
Aleu were all warned to fall into line or be replaced in two 
months.

SPLM's 11-point Plan for Peace in Darfur 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The SPLM decided upon the following course of action to 
help the crisis in Darfur: 
 
(1) Reiterate support for deployment of UN forces in Darfur to 
protect the civilian population and enable delivery of humanitarian 
aid.  A high-ranking SPLM official commented to Consul General Juba 
that the humanitarian and protection goals must be clear to allay 
the fears of ruling NCP. 
 
(2) Urge the NCP and other members of the Government of National 
Unity (GNU) to consent to deployment of UN troops and try to find a 
face-saving way to avoid confrontation with the international 
community. 
 
(3) Engage the armed movements in Darfur, including SLA/Abdel Wahid 
and the National Redemption Front, to address their concerns with 
the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA). 
 
(4) Call for an immediate ceasefire in Darfur between the Sudan 
Armed Forces (SAF) and all armed movements. 
 
(5) Call for a cessation of hostilities between ethnic groups and 
begin a traditional reconciliation process that includes the 
janjaweed. 
 
(6) Convene a meeting in Southern Sudan with all armed movements to 
achieve a comprehensive peace. 
 
(7) Call for dialogue between the parties to the conflict. 
 
(8) At the conclusion of this process, call for the African Union to 
convene the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and Consultation (DDDC). 
 
(9) Engage the USG in dialogue with the GNU to improve bilateral 
relations. 
 
(10) Work for the realization of the proposed meeting between 
President Bush and President Bashir. 
 
(11) Task the Chairman of the SPLM (Salva Kiir) to form a Contact 
and Follow-up High Committee on Darfur under his leadership.
