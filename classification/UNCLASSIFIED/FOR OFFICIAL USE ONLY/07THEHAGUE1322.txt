CONTRIBUTION, CITING FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS 
 
REF: STATE 94985 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On July 10, Poloff discussed reftel with Roger van 
Laak, Senior Policy Advisor at the Dutch MFA's Department of 
Middle East and North African Affairs, thanking the Dutch for 
their prior contributions to the Multinational Force and 
Observers (MFO). In response to reftel points regarding 
additional contributions to support the purchase of fifteen 
fully armored vehicles (FAVs), van Laak was dubious, citing 
"stretched financial means" as the likely reason why the 
Dutch will not provide additional support at this time.  He 
intends to raise the issue when Director General Larocco 
visits The Hague on July 20-21, but anticipates that it 
"might be difficult" to overcome budgetary constraints to 
garner support for additional contributions.
