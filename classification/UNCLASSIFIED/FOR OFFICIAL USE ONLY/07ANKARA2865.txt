¶1. (SBU) Summary:  An Atlasjet flight from Istanbul to Isparta, 
Turkey crashed 12 km from the Isparta Airport at approximately 01:45 
local time on 30 November, 2007.  The plane was a McDonald-Douglas 
¶83.  The remains of all 57 onboard have been located by Search and 
Rescue teams.  The pilot, Serhat Ozdemir, is reported by his sister 
to be a naturalized U.S. Citizen, but we have been unable to confirm 
this.  The cause of the crash has not been determined but has been 
speculated as either mechanical failure or pilot error.  NTSB, FAA,

asked specifically that NO U.S. AGENCY ANNOUNCE AT THIS TIME OUR 
ASSISTANCE WITH THE INVESTIGATION.  We agreed to respect DGCA's 
wishes as they deal with press speculation.  End summary.

CAUSE OF CRASH UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The cause of the crash has not been determined at this 
time.  Speculation and the images of the wreckage suggest either 
mechanical failure or pilot error.  Representatives from the 
 
ANKARA 00002865  002 OF 002 
 
 
National Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB), the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA), Boeing and Pratt and Whitney Engines will 
arrive in Antalya, Turkey on Sunday, 2 December to assist with the 
investigation.  They will be met and assisted by representatives 
from the Turkish DGCA during their time in Turkey.  TURKISH DGCA 
DIRECTOR GENERAL ARIDURU SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED THAT NO ANNOUNCEMENT 
BE MADE AT THIS TIME BY ANY USG AGENCY THAT WE WILL ASSIST WITH THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
 
ONE POSSIBLE AMCIT ONBOARD 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Media reports quote the sister of the aircraft's captain, 
Serhat Ozdemir, who says that Ozdemir lived in the U.S. and 
subsequently became a naturalized American citizen.  We have been 
unable to confirm his citizenship and believe that the sister might 
be mistaken.  His next of kin reside in Izmir, Turkey and Consular 
officer are therefore not needed to provide death notification or 
repatriation of remains.
