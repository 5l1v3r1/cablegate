¶1. (SBU) The UAEG pledged $20 million in assistance to 
Lebanon early in the crisis, and has now committed an 
unspecified amount to rebuild Lebanese hospitals and schools. 
 MFA's Assistant Under Secretary for International 
Cooperation Ambassador Mohammad Abdul Rahim Abdul Jalil told 
the Charge August 19 that the money for hospitals and schools 
would be in addition to the previously committed $20 million 
and that the UAEG was now looking for an appropriate 
mechanism to implement the decision.  UAE President Khalifa 
bin Zayed al-Nahyan has also ordered the resumption of a 
longstanding UAE-sponsored operation to clear an estimated 
130,000 mines from southern Lebanon (left from the previous 
Israeli occupation). 
 
¶2. (U) Private citizens resident in the UAE reportedly have 
contributed over Dh54 million ($14.7 million) to Lebanese 
relief efforts.  The quasi-official UAE Red Crescent Society 
(RCS) and Muhammad bin Rashid Charity and Humanitarian 
Foundation (MbR Foundation) have been the primary conduits 
for private donations (in addition to their own institutional 
contributions).  The RCS sponsored a telethon and collection 
campaigns in malls, hotels, and the Lebanese Embassy.  Press 
reports on August 20 claimed the RCS had disbursed 
approximately Dh35 million ($9.5 million), largely through 
distribution centers the society has established in Lebanon 
and on the Lebanon-Syria border.  The MbR Foundation 
reportedly has allocated Dh40 million ($10.9 million) for 
Lebanon.  It maintains its own air bridge and at least 18 
makeshift camps for distributing aid to refugees, including a 
special focus on Lebanese refugees in 
Syria.  RCS and MbR Foundation relief shipments continue to 
arrive in Lebanon almost daily (including an RCS-coordinated 
ship loaded with 2,500 tons of supplies).
