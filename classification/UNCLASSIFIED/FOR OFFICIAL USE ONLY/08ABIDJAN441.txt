     ¶B. ABIDJAN 214 
 
¶1. (U) On July 2, 2008, the Ivorian government announced a 
three month extension of special tax reductions on basic 
foodstuffs (rice, milk, palm oil, fish and tomatoes).  The 
reductions were originally announced on March 31 and put into 
effect on  April 1, following demonstrations against the high 
cost of food (Reftel B) and were meant to contain the 
political effects from the public's discontent about the 
rising prices of basic commodities.  Measures extended were a 
VAT reduction from 18 to 9 percent as well as the suspension 
of the development tax on rice farming. 
 
¶2. (U) Despite the government's announcement, the consumers' 
association which claimed responsibility for the March 
demonstrations stated that these measures have had no effect 
on consumers' purchasing power due to a lack of price 
enforcement.  The group expressed concern that imminent 
increases in the price of gasoline, diesel, and cooking gas 
would exacerbate the impact of price increases on consumers' 
wallets.  (Note: On July 6, the government announced new 
price increases for petroleum products, effective midnight 
July 7.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment.  Given the just announced price increases 
in petroleum products, the government likely felt that it was 
politically necessary to extend the tax holiday on the basic 
commodities.  However, the measures will prolong the fiscal 
drain on the national treasury produced by the tax 
reductions.  The IMF estimated in April that the "temporary" 
tax measures would cost the Treasury USD 20-25 million. 
Extension of the measure will likely produce a similar 
shortfall.  Given the widely discussed liquidity problem at 
the Treasury, this move will only diminish Finance Minister 
Diby's options as he struggles to find the means to pay for 
elections, for national identification and voting cards, 
disarmament and the new national service program designed to 
absorb demobilized ex-combatants.  End Comment.
