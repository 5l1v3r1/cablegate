(SBU)  In answer to Ref A demarche, Director of Cambodian MFA 
Office of International Affairs Suon Son told Pol/Ec section 
chief October 30 that he had highlighted in the strongest 
terms our previous delivery of demarche in support of David 
Walker (Ref B) and that MFA Secretary of State Ouch Borith 
was in full support of the candidate.  Suon, who has 
previously served as Cambodia's representative to the United 
Nations (as has Ouch Borith), noted that he emphasized the 
importance to the U.S. of having a member on the UN's IAAC as 
the U.S. is the largest contributor and deeply involved in UN 
financial reform.  Suon said that Ouch Borith believed in the 
political significance of Cambodia's support for the U.S. 
candidate, as did Suon.  He took on board our request to 
instruct Cambodia's representative at the UN to vote for 
Walker. However, the final decision would be taken by Foreign 
Minister Hor Namhong and no final decision has yet been made, 
Suon noted.  (COMMENT:  We believe such strong support at 
this level in the MFA will translate into full support in the 
November 2 vote at the UN.  END COMMENT.)
