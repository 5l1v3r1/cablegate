SUBJECT: CHINA SHOWS INTEREST IN DETAILS OF 123 AGREEMENT 
WITH INDIA 
 
REF: STATE 104171 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Emboffs met with MFA Department of Arms Control 
Nuclear Division Deputy Director Xia Tian to deliver reftel 
nonpaper and a copy of the U.S.-India Joint Statement 
regarding the United States-India Agreement for Peaceful 
Nuclear Cooperation (123 Agreement).  DOE China Executive 
Director placed special emphasis on India's commitment under 
the 123 Agreement to establish a new civilian national 
enrichment facility under International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) safeguards dedicated to reprocessing safeguarded 
nuclear material.  Emboffs urged Xia to treat the nonpaper as 
"NSG Confidential." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Xia, using notes prepared in advance, slowly and 
deliberately commented that "While China in principle 
supports such international cooperation, there remains some 
divergence in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) for which 
time will be needed to discuss the details of this agreement. 
The next meeting of the NSG Advisory Group will be critical." 
 Continuing to refer to his prepared notes, Xia then raised 
several concerns.  Specifically, he asked: 
 
--Does the Agreement include the transfer of enrichment or 
reprocessing technology or equipment? 
--What happens if India tests again? 
--Is the right-of-return written into the Agreement? 
--Will the Agreement be voted on by the U.S. Congress before 
being presented to the NSG Advisory Group? 
 
Xia noted that discussions in the NSG could be "problematic" 
if the 123 Agreement is not first approved by the U.S. 
Congress.  Emboffs were able to answer all questions on the 
basis of reftel guidance, the U.S.-India Joint Statement, and 
Under Secretary Burns' On-The-Record Briefing.
