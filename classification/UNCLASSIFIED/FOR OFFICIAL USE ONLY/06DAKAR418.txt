DANILOVICH,S LETTER 
 
REF: A. DANILOVICH-SALL LETTER OF FEBRUARY 13 
 
     ¶B. STATE 022747 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On February 20, Charge hand delivered the 
translated copy of Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) 
Chief Executive Officer John Danilovich,s February 13 letter 
to Senegalese Prime Minister Macky Sall (Ref A).  Sall noted 
that he had already received the English-language version 
from the Senegalese Embassy in Washington.  Nonetheless, he 
was anxious to understand the letter and the timing.  Charge 
told the Prime Minister that the United States remains 
committed to developing a Millennium Challenge Account 
Compact with Senegal.  We have made some progress toward 
Compact development, and the demand study has been completed. 
 Nonetheless, the United States is troubled that key 
commitments made in July and October have yet to be 
implemented.  We understand that a draft decree imposing a 
legally binding moratorium on land market activity in the 
Diamniadio area has been ready for some time.  Charge also 
noted that the MCC is proceeding with aerial photography as a 
sign of good faith. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Prime Minister said one of the reasons for 
delay has been perceived conflicts with the Malaysian housing 
project, proposed free-trade zone and the toll road.  Sall 
said that he is satisfied that the MCC is aware of those 
projects; so there should be no conflict.  Sall said he would 
discuss the proposed decree and other measures with President 
Wade on February 21.  He also said his choice of a land 
market overseer would be the Prefect who is responsible for 
Diamniadio, but he would also discuss that with President 
Wade. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT: Charge delivered the letter on the same 
day that "Sud Quotidien," an independent Dakar daily, 
published a front-page story expressing new doubts about 
whether Senegal will ever conclude a MCA Compact. 
Nonetheless, the atmospherics of the meeting were good.  Sall 
was not defensive and, on the contrary, seems anxious to meet 
the March 17 deadline and move ahead with Compact 
development.  We continue to believe that making the results 
of the demand study available as soon as possible would be 
helpful.  Septels describe Sall,s comments on the "Idrissa 
Seck/Chantier de Thies case," corruption and the Casamance 
peace process.  END COMMENT.
