piracy court, MFA Treaty and Law Department International Law 
Division Deputy Director Xu Yu told PolOff June 17 in response to 
reftel points urging China's support for the U.S. position opposing 
the creation of an international tribunal to prosecute piracy

court systems in prosecuting pirates.  Xu said China shared "most 
U.S. views," including concerns about the resources anQlengthy
