¶1. (SBU) Summary: Istanbul's Bahcesehir University conducted 
a face-to-face survey with 1,714 Turks on radicalism and 
extremism as measured by neighborhood tolerance in 34 cities. 
 The poll revealed high levels of intolerance toward 
non-Muslim, American, homosexual, and non-married neighbors. 
It also revealed conservative attitudes toward atheists, 
alcohol consumption, and modern revealing clothes such as 
women's bathing suits and shorts.  Surprisingly, respondents 
aged 15-18 demonstrated the highest levels of intolerance. 
Critics point to respondents' lack of education on the issues 
and low level of poll-taking sophistication as some of the 
main reasons for such xenophobic results. Many placed the 
highest blame on the EU (over Israel and US foreign policy) 
as the greatest reason behind the world's problems today. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Istanbul's Bahcesehir University conducted a 
face-to-face survey, published June 1,with 1,714 Turks from 
34 cities to gauge Turkish public opinion on radicalism and 
extremism based upon tolerance of different groups, 
lifestyles, and ideologies.  The pollsters asked a series of 
questions regarding neighborhood pressures.  The study showed 
that three out of four people do not want a neighbor who 
drinks alcohol or is an atheist.  Meanwhile, 43 percent 
responded that they did not want to live next to Americans. 
The survey also revealed high intolerance for unmarried 
couples, families with daughters who wear shorts, and 
homosexuals.  Perhaps most troubling were results which 
revealed that those aged 15-18 demonstrated the highest 
levels of intolerance, especially related to non-Muslims, 
homosexuals, and Americans. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Approximately 10 percent of respondents reported 
feeling subject to neighborhood pressures and discrimination 
because of their religious beliefs.  When asked "Which of 
these important values would you prioritize?" over 60 percent 
replied religion.  Only 16 percent selected secularism, 13 
percent democracy, and five percent their ethnic identity. 
An estimated five percent reported discrimination due to 
religious belief or gender; four percent reported 
discrimination due to their secular association.  Six percent 
said they face social or status discrimination due to their 
"mother tongue." (NOTE: "Mother tongue" is a frequently used 
euphemism for Kurdish. END NOTE) However, 69 percent agreed 
that Islamic extremism was a threat to Turkey. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The study also showed negative attitudes toward 
women and their place in society.  Over 70 percent indicated 
that the head of the household in Turkey should be a man.  35 
percent agreed that a woman's testimony in court should be 
held equal to only half that of a man's because "women are 
emotional."  Almost 60 percent believed that men are better 
political leaders than women, despite Turkey having been 
governed by a female Prime Minister (Tansu Ciller) in the 
1990's.  Roughly 60 percent indicated that women walking on 
the beach in a swimsuit is a "sin" and 36 percent said they 
did not want to have neighbors whose daughters wore shorts. 
While 89 percent of Turks surveyed opposed polygamy, 78 
percent condoned the stoning of women to death for adultery. 
However, 63 percent said it was "irrational" for women 
worldwide to cover their faces with veils. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Some critics have called the validity of 
the study into question, citing respondents' "discomfort with 
the issues."  Police reportedly detained groups of pollsters 
in several cities after respondents complained that some of 
the survey questions had made them uncomfortable, 
particularly questions regarding the Kurdish issue, and 
lifestyle preferences.  It is possible a lack of 
understanding of the issues also played an important role in 
dictating respondents' answers.  Some commentators were 
incredulous at the selection of the EU (over Israel, 
terrorism and USG foreign policy) as the primary proponent of 
policies that cause the world's problems.  This represents, 
perhaps, a backlash against European leaders who continue to 
use the prospect of Turkish membership in the EU as a 
political football.
