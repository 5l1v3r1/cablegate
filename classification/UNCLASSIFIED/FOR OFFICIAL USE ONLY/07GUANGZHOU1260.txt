¶2. (U) Over the weekend, former Chongqing Party Secretary Wang Yang 
was named Guangdong Party Secretary, replacing Zhang Dejiang.  Media 
reports indicate Zhang will be promoted to a still unconfirmed

could replace Wu Yi as Vice Premier. 
 
¶3. (U) Guo Shengkun was appointed Party Secretary of Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region, replacing Liu Qibao, who has been named Party 
Secretary of Sichuan Province.  In apparently unrelated news,

Guangxi Vice Chairman (the autonomous region's equivalent to a 
provincial vice governor) Sun Yu was dismissed on November 30 for 
allegedly receiving bribes worth RMB 400 million (about US$54 
million) related to construction of a flood control and water 
conservation project.
