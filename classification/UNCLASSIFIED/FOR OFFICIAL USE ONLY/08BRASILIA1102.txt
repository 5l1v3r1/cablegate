¶2.  (SBU) Summary.  At an August 14 meeting with Environment, 
Science and Technology Counselor, the Brazilian Ministry of External 
Relations' (MRE) Director of the Division for Disarmament and 
Sensitive Technologies (DDS), Min. Santiago Irazabal Mourao, 
emphasized Brazil's overall support for creating an exception for 
India in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) full-scope safeguards 
provision.  Brazil did have specific concerns about Paragraph 2 
(chapeau) of the draft text and suggested dropping or revising 
Paragraph 4.  Mourao said the best way forward would be to make the 
August 21-22 NSG Plenary a drafting session and have a follow up 
meeting to adopt it.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Environment, Science and Technology (EST) Counselor met on 
August 14 with the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations' (MRE) 
Director of the Division for Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies 
(DDS), Min. Santiago Irazabal Mourao, and Fabio Simao Alves, Nuclear 
Affairs Officers in DDS, to urge Brazil's support - per reftel - for 
a quick and positive outcome at the August 21-22 Nuclear Suppliers 
Group (NSG) Plenary.  Mourao will go to the NSG Plenary. 
 
SUPPORTIVE OF AN EXCEPTION FOR INDIA 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Mourao said that Brazil endorses the concept of creating 
an exception for India to the NSG's full-scope safeguards provision. 
 Further, he liked the proposed procedure of using a Presidential 
Statement.  Brazil would be ready to join a consensus.  (Note.  In a 
similar vein, MRE's Director of the Department for International 
Organizations, Min. Carlos Sergio Sobral Duarte, who oversees 
Mourao's division, told visiting Acting Deputy Secretary of Energy 
Jeffrey Kupfer at an August 6 meeting that Duarte had recently met 
with senior Indian officials and told them that Brazil wanted to 
help them on the NSG exception issue.  End Note.) 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Moreover, Mourao recognized that the USG was seeking to 
move rapidly on this matter.  He noted that the time pressure on the 
USG was different from that on Brazil.  For Brazil's part, all that 
would be needed to create an exception for India under domestic law 
and regulations would be a Presidential decree.  That said, however, 
Mourao stated Brazil does want to move on this matter in an 
expeditious manner. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The draft text of the statement, which Mourao knew by 
memory, was generally something that Brazil could endorse.  He had 
two changes that Brazil wanted to be made in the text.  Mourao said 
he had talked very recently with the Chair of the NSG Consultative 
Group to discuss these points. 
 
CHANGES SOUGHT IN CHAPEAU OF PARAGRAPH 2 AND PARAGRAPH 4 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Mourao explained that Brazil seeks a change in the chapeau 
of Paragraph 2, which provides that the NSG welcomes "India's 
efforts with respect to the following NONPROLIFERATION COMMITMENTS 
and ACTIONS".  Subparagraph 2(c) concerns signing an adhering to an 
Additional Protocol.  Mourao highlighted that Brazil has not signed 
an Additional Protocol.  He said the current implication in 
Paragraph 2 is that signing an Additional Protocol constitutes a 
"nonproliferation commitment".   This could suggest that Brazil - 
without an Additional Protocol - is not fully supportive of 
nonproliferation efforts.  Mourao had no objection to welcoming 
India taking the "action" of signing an Additional Protocol. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Moreover, Mourao said Brazil had concerns about 
subparagraph 2(d) which relates to transfer of enrichment and 
reprocessing technologies.  Again, he didn't want this referred to 
as a "nonproliferation commitment" though calling it an action taken 
by India would be acceptable.  He felt confident that satisfactory 
language could be worked out in the chapeau of Paragraph 2. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Mourao raised one other specific item, though he did not 
press strongly, with respect to Paragraph 4, regarding non-member 
adherents.  He understood the intent of the paragraph and was fine 
with as far as it went.  He thought, however, that it would produce 
a significant amount of discussion by others.  He said it might be 
better to leave it out altogether.  Mourao did not offer any 
specific changes to Paragraph 4. 
 
THE WAY FORWARD 
 
BRASILIA 00001102  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Mourao said that he thought the best and quickest way to 
proceed would be to make the August 21-22 Plenary a drafting 
session.  He envisioned a number of countries coming with proposal 
to change the draft text and these would be worked out.  After a 
drafting session, a follow up session could be held to approve the 
results.  Brazil for one would be going to the August 21-22 Plenary 
ready and willing to participate in working to prepare a 
satisfactory draft. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) He noted that some countries with concerns about the 
India exception were consulting with each other in anticipation of 
the upcoming Plenary, but that Brazil was not in the loop because it 
was seen by others as already being in favor.  The big question mark 
for Mourao was China.  He said he could not tell which way China 
would go.  (Note.  The British and French are planning to jointly 
demarche Mourao along the lines of the USG demarche.  End Note.)
