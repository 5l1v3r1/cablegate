¶1.  (SBU) Embassy delivered reftel points jointly with 
Russian and Dutch troika counterparts to Oleh Klynchenko at 
Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on April 23. 
Klynchenko, who heads the MFA's Political Planning Division, 
said that Ukraine would send at least two, and possibly up to 
four, representatives to the Hague for the Global Initiative 
to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) Plenary June 16-17. 
Klynchenko said that the GOU had not yet determined who would 
represent Ukraine but that its delegation would include 
representatives from the MFA and the Security Service of 
Ukraine (SBU).  After reviewing the draft agenda, Klynchenko 
said that the GOU plans to speak at one or more of the 
working group sessions. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Klynchenko thanked the U.S. for providing financial 
assistance via the Embassy's Customs Attache so that Ukraine 
was able to send representatives to recent GICNT events in 
Garmisch and Seoul.  He affirmed that the GOU highly values 
its participation in GICNT events and that it expects to have 
enough funds to participate in GICNT events through 2009. 
Klynchenko said that Ukraine would send up to four 
participants from the SBU to the upcoming workshop in 
Morocco. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)   Klynchenko explained that a number of events in 
the "spirit of GICNT" would take place in Ukraine in 
2009-2010.  The Ukrainian NGO "Scientific Research, 
Information, and Analysis Center LEX" will host an event on 
countering nuclear terrorism in September 2009 in Kyiv.  He 
also mentioned that the GUAM Organization for Democracy and 
Economic Development, with the support of the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime, would hold a regional workshop on 
countering terrorism this year.  The GOU also is planning a 
tactical exercise on countering terrorism in either 2009 or 
2010 near Chernobyl.
