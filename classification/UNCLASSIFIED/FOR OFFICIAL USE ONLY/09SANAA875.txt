¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY. Although H1N1 influenza (informally known 
as swine flu) has not yet arrived in Yemen, the ROYG has 
mobilized resources in preparation for its arrival.   The 
Ministry of Health has set up a 24-hour operations room and 
distributed Tamiflu to cities throughout Yemen.  A quarantine 
office at the airport is screening arriving passengers 
through a questionnaire and temperature checks using thermal 
imaging devices.  Post has briefed Embassy staff and sent a 
warden message to the American community with the most recent 
information on H1N1 influenza.  Prior preparations for H5N1 
influenza (avian flu) have proven fortuitous in the face of 
yet another pandemic flu threat.  END SUMMARY. 
 
PRIOR PREPARATIONS PRECLUDE POOR PERFORMANCE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) The ROYG has mobilized resources in preparation for a 
local outbreak of H1N1 influenza.  Dr. Ali Al-Mudhwahi, 
Director General of Family Health at the Ministry of Public 
Health and Population, told EconOff on May 4 that the ROYG 
has updated the national preparedness plan for H1N1 influenza 
(informally known as swine flu), sent the Minister of Health 
to the Gulf Cooperation Council,s (GCC) emergency meeting on 
H1N1 influenza, and taken practical steps to identify 
infectious people.  (NOTE: In the current GCC session, the 
Yemeni Minister of Public Health and Population, Abdul-Karim 
Rase,a, is the chair of the GCC Health Ministers, which 
places Yemen at the forefront of regional efforts, even 
though it is not a full member of the GCC.  END NOTE.)  The 
ROYG has reactivated the 24-hour operation room in the 
Central Office for Surveillance at the Ministry of Health in 
collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture.  The Ministry 
of Health is working closely with the National Center for 
Health Education and Information, which issues reports to the 
mass media, both nationally and regionally. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to Dr. Mohammed Jahaf, Coordinator of Lab 
Based Surveillance at the Ministry of Public Health and 
Population, the ROYG has instituted extensive guidelines for 
case management.  Jahaf told EconOff on May 4 that the 
ministry has distributed Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) to 
local branches in main cities.  The ministry has also 
identified coordinators at the governorate level and district 
levels.  In preparation for H5N1 influenza (avian flu) in 
2005, the ROYG acquired enough quantities of Tamiflu to treat 
five percent of the Yemeni population.  With a shelf-life 
until 2010, the Tamiflu, although limited in quantity, is 
still available to treat H1N1 influenza.  The ROYG is 
acquiring a kit from the World Health Organization (WHO) this 
week to test for the H1N1 virus variety. 
 
THERMAL IMAGING DEVICES IN USE AT AIRPORT 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) A 24-hour Quarantine Office has been in operation to 
screen arriving passengers at all three international 
airports (Sanaa, Aden, and Mukalla) since April 19. 
Personnel screen passengers for H1N1 influenza via a 
questionnaire that every passenger fills out upon arrival in 
Yemen.  Since May 3, the ROYG has also instituted a process 
of thermography to screen for arriving passengers with 
elevated temperatures, using ThermoFlash, Model LX-26.  If an 
arriving passenger has a temperature above 37.8 degrees 
Celsius or 104.5 degrees Fahrenheit, they are given a blood 
test.  If a passenger is found to be ill, they are 
immediately taken to the hospital or given a dose of Tamiflu, 
also available at the airport. 
 
EMBASSY SANAA,S SITREP 
---------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Post,s Health Unit has briefed the Embassy 
community on CDC,S assessment of H1N1 influenza.  The 
Embassy,s Regional Medical Officer told EconOff on May 3 
that the Health Unit has enough Tamiflu to treat all Embassy 
Americans, but not the Locally Employed Staff.  Post,s 
consular section disseminated a warden message related to 
H1N1 influenza on May 2 with the latest information about the 
flu.

SANAA 00000875  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Prior preparations for H5N1 influenza (avian flu) 
have proven fortuitous in the face of another pandemic flu 
threat.  In 2005, the ROYG acquired the necessary resources 
for detection and treatment of the H5N1 virus up to Phase III 
of the WHO,s pandemic influenza progression.  The ROYG 
remains in close contact with GCC colleagues and the WHO, and 
uses the National Center for Health Education and Information 
to disseminate reports.  As a result, the ROYG has been able 
to mobilize resources in a relatively short time and is 
prepared to share breaking news with the public.  END
