REF: STATE 80300 
 
(SBU) On May 12, A/POL conveyed reftel points, requesting 
that capitals convey U.S. concern about AmCit harassment in 
Iran to their Iranian interlocutors, to Kang Do-ho, MOFAT's 
Middle East Division Director.  In a subsequent meeting on 
May 14, Kang told A/POL that the ROKG would deliver U.S. 
concerns to the Iranian Government, especially about the case 
of the missing person.  Kang noted that the Iranian 
Ambassador to Seoul in late May had met with MOFAT's 
Director-General for the Middle East and African Affairs 
Bureau to deliver concerns about alleged detained Iranians in 
Iraq.  A/POL emphasized that suspicious Iranian activities in 
Iraq, particularly those with Iraqi insurgents, were of an 
entirely different nature than the cases of American citizens 
detained while visiting relatives or conducting humanitarian 
work that posed no threat.  Kang conceded the point and said 
Seoul would communicate with Iranian interlocutors about the 
missing/detained AmCits.
