SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE DPRK 
 
REF: SECSTATE 60616 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 12 we met with Costa Rican MFA Coordinator 
of U.N. Security Council issues Adriana Murillo and 
Disarmament Chief Carlos Cordero to discuss reftel talking 
points.  In parallel we also contacted Elaine White, COS to 
FM Bruno Stagno.  Murillo thanked us for the information, and 
expressed Costa Rica's support for the draft resolution. 
However, she expressed frustration at the lack of input that 
had been offered to Costa Rica and the other non-permanent 
members in the drafting process. Shortly after the UNSC vote, 
White confirmed that Costa Rica had voted in favor of the 
resolution, and that Stagno had been closely monitoring the 
issue. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Murillo and Cordero also brought up the question of 
what comes next, and mentioned U.S. media reports that North 
Korea is already preparing for another nuclear test.  They 
asked that we provide them with any information on future 
U.S. plans as soon as possible.  Additionally, they expressed 
interest in the make-up of the expert panel that will be 
created under the new resolution, and hoped that there would 
be some kind of regional representation on the panel. ACTION 
REQUEST: We'd like to be able to provide further information 
as available. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: Murillo and Cordero clearly thought it 
amusing that we would present them "our ideas" on the new 
DPRK resolution at almost the same time the vote was taking 
place in New York.  Given the late transmission of Reftel 
(only a few hours ahead of the scheduled vote), that was the 
best we could do.  As readers in Washington and New York well 
know, Costa Rica considers itself to be a leader on 
international disarmament issues, and a conscientious player 
on the UNSC.  The MFA was thus clearly disappointed that 
Costa Rica hadn't been given sufficient chance to "make its 
voice heard" on this issue.  This is a familiar Tico refrain 
and an almost inevitable problem given the delay in clearing 
important demarches out of the Department, and the 
fast-moving developments in New York.  Although we appreciate 
these difficulties, we reiterate what we have reported in the 
past. If we are seriously seeking Costa Rican support on key 
UNSC issues, we should either focus the action in New York, 
or provide more timely demarche instructions from Washington.
