REF: SECSTATE 178061 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) Post provided reftel demarche to Darryl Dunn, 
Director of the Middle East and Africa Division at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  On October 30, 
Ondine Godtschalk, Policy Officer in the Division, called 
Pol-Econ Couns to say that as in the past, New Zealand would 
abstain on extending the mandates on the three UN bodies. 
GNZ doubts the validity of the Committees' mandates, which 
seem to duplicate that of the UN Special Rapporteur and 
others, Godtschalk said.
