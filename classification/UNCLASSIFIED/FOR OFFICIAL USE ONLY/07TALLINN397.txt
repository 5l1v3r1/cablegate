Â¶1. (SBU) On June 11, we delivered reftel points 
concerning the issue of missing and detained American 
citizens in Iran to Marin Mottus, MFA Director for 
Middle East, Latin America, and Africa, and Reen Liivat, 
MFA U.S. Desk Officer.  On June 12, Mottus and Liivat 
expressed to us their regrets over Iranian harassment of 
U.S. citizens in Iran.  However, both noted that since 
Estonia does not have a diplomatic presence in Iran, the 
GOE is not in a position to raise this matter with the 
Government of Iran.
