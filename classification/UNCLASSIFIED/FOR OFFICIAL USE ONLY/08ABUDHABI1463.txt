REF: STATE 126054 
 
¶1. (U) This is a joint Embassy Abu Dhabi - Consulate General Dubai 
cable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On December 1, post delivered reftel talking points via 
diplomatic note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Post also passed 
the points to Ali Fayel, the Ministry of Economy's point-of-contact 
on the Kimberley Process (KP).  On December 23, Fayel told EconOff 
that he had passed the information to the UAE's KP office and was 
still awaiting an official response.  Fayel said that a team visited 
the UAE from Zimbabwe to examine the smuggled diamonds seized by 
Dubai Customs in October 2008, but that he understood Customs had 
been unable to schedule the examination during the visit.  Fayel said 
he was in the process of following up with UAE KP officials and would 
provide more details in the new year.  Post will report further 
information when available. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On December 15, Dubai PolEconOff passed reftel points to 
David Rutledge (CEO Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC)) and Youri 
Steverlynck (CEO, Dubai Diamond Exchange (DDE)).  Rutledge commented 
that the certifying countries should be held accountable for KP 
violations, not countries, like the UAE, who do not certify diamonds. 
 Rutledge and Steverlynck stated the DMCC would put out a notice to 
traders alerting them to the possibility of illicit Zimbabwean 
diamonds and forged paperwork.  Steverlynck noted he had just 
received a packet from the KP working group on specifications helpful 
in identifying illegal Zimbabwean diamonds.  Rutledge and Steverlynck 
also expressed concern about protecting the DDE's reputation and 
expressed willingness to work with EEB/MTA Sue Saarnio and the KP 
working group on the issue.
