¶1. (SBU) On March 26, Kari Kahiluoto, MFA Ambassador for 
Human Rights and Democracy, met with Charge to discuss the 
Alliance fr Civilizations (AOC) meeting in Istanbul (April2009), the UN, the Finnish Holocaust Task Force memership 
application, the Community of Democraciesmeeting (uly 
2009), and the Durban Review Confeence attendance (April 
2009).  Kahiluoto inquire about possible political and 
practical ways forthe Government of Finland (GoF) to link to 
the U.S. Democracy Promotion Agenda and cooperate on work in 
third countries.  He anticipates a Finnish visit to the U.S. 
this year on that subject.  He further remarked, without 
giving specifics, that the GoF is considering contributing to 
the UN Democracy Fund. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kahiluoto expects Finnish Minister for European 
Migration Astrid Thors to represent the GoF at the Alliance 
of Civilizations meeting in Istanbul.  Ambassador Kahiluoto 
expects to attend the Durban Review Conference as part of the 
Finnish delegation.  He said that while the Finns are 
dissatisfied with the length and subject matter of the Durban 
agenda, they will attend the conference in order to try to 
prevent the outcome from "decapitating human rights" at the 
UN.  He suggested keeping an eye on the atmosphere at the AOC 
meeting, which he thought might signal the tone for the 
Durban Review Conference. (NOTE: In a March 28 discussion, 
President Halonen told Charg that she expected to attend the 
AOC meeting.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Upon taking office last fall, Kahiluoto told Poloff 
of Finland's intent to join the Holocaust Task Force.   He 
offered Charge the following reasons for pursuing membership: 
 (1) Finnish interest in human rights; (2) Bringing Finland 
in line with Council of Europe, UNESCO, and OSCE positions; 
(3) Countering emerging xenophobic tendencies in Europe; (4) 
Linking Finnish academics and researchers to other members; 
and (5) Maintaining Finnish national image as a strong 
promoter of human rights. Kahiluoto expects the GoF to make a 
presentation in Oslo this year and submit the required 
baseline study for membership before April 20.
