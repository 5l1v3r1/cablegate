Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please protect accordingly. 
 
(SBU) Absent our normal MFA/Arab League contacts, already in 
Riyadh in preparation for the summit, Poloff delivered the 
points conveyed reftel to Khaled Naceri, Deputy Director of 
Arab and Islamic Multilateral Affairs at the Moroccan 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Naceri confirmed Foreign 
Minister Benaissa's attendance in Riyadh but did not know if 
a decision had been made regarding the attendence of King 
Mohammed VI.  Naceri promised to provide a substantive 
response to the U.S. points as soon possible.   We expect 
Morocco will take moderate and constructive stances during 
Arab League deliberations, but will not publicly deviate from 
whatever consensus positions are reached.
