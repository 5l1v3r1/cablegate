SUBJECT: MONITORING REFUGEE HEALTH CENTERS IN JORDAN-- 
PROVIDING SERVICES TO A SMALL PATIENT GROUP 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary:  RefCoord and Program Specialist visited 
on December 22,  three health centers for the benefit of 
Iraqis administered by Jordan Red Crescent Society (JRC) on 
behalf of three different donors: UNHCR, International 
Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and 
ECHO.  The centers were open, but not all were fully 
staffed.  In each center, Iraqis made up a significant 
proportion of those seeking treatment or having 
prescriptions filled.  The patients were aware of their 
rights and the free services available to them, and had not 
been inappropriately asked to pay for services.  Staff were 
familiar with procedures for processing refugees, and 
appeared adequate to meet the demand for services.  End 
summary. 
 
UNHCR-JRC Health Center--Doctors and UNHCR Supervision 
Absent 
-------------------------- --------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) The UNHCR-funded Misdar Health center in East Amman 
was co-located with the Jordanian Red Crescent Society 
hospital.  JRC provided medical care and administrative 
services.  The building was clean and orderly, and 
reception staff attended promptly to the clients. 
Information on refugee rights, UNHCR registration of other 
refugee programs was up to date, and posted in Arabic in 
common areas. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) RefCoord visited the center during what UNHCR 
identified as high-traffic hours, but neither the UNHCR 
officer-in-charge nor the two doctors assigned to treat 
Iraqis were present.  RefCoord spoke to a JRC doctor who 
said one of the UNHCR-funded doctors was on vacation and 
the other had not yet arrived at work.  JRC Medical 
personnel filled in to examine and treat the patients. 
Although there were only six patients awaiting treatment, 
the hospital staff reported that the center received an 
average of 70 Iraqi patients per day, and the staff was 
overwhelmed by the work. 
 
IFRC-JRC Health Center Jebel Taj--Good Cooperation with 
Other NGOs 
----------- ------------------ ------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (U) The Jebel Taj center is located in a mixed 
business/residential area, on the first floor of a building 
that also houses the PRM-funded International Medical Corps 
(IMC)-sponsored clinic.  Medical staff reported good 
cooperation between the two centers.  At the IFRC-supported 
Jebel Taj center, more than a dozen Iraqis waited for care. 
The center staff reported that between 20 and 30 patients 
seek treatment at the center on a daily basis.  Doctors 
were present and treating patients.  The center was clean 
and in good repair.  The pharmacy was in operation, and 
staff carefully documented the issuance of drugs.  The 
entrances are clearly marked.  During RefCoord's visit, a 
patient with an injured leg had difficultly negotiating the 
stairs.  Access to the center for handicapped patients 
would be difficult. 
 
IFRC-JRC Marka Health Center--A Busy Center Well Staffed 
-------- -------------------------- -------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) At the Marka Clinic, RefCoord met with Dr. Abu 
Farha, who was employed by JRC in East Amman.  Dr. Farha 
had served Iraqis in more than one health center, and had 
an overview of how Iraqis used health services in Amman. 
He said the Marka clinic received an average of 20 to 30 
patients per day.  He said that the bulk of his patients 
were following treatment regimes for chronic illness and 
came for prescription drugs.  The building was clean and in 
good repair.  Six Iraqi patients visited the clinic during 
RefCoord's visit.  Dr. Farha said that he sees Iraqi 
patients at more than one center, and he noticed that some 
patients "abuse" the free medication available to them by 
filling prescriptions repeatedly at more than one center. 
He said, however, that this fraud was not widespread and 
did not effect operations. 
 
¶6.  (U) Comment:  These three visits were follow-ups to 
earlier visits to the same health centers.  The numbers of 
clients visiting the clinics seemed consistent with NGO/IO 
reporting.  The numbers of medical staff on hand appeared 
to be sufficient to deal with the demand for services.  End 
comment.
