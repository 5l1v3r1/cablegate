THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. 
 
¶1.  (U) PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT MAHMOUD ABBAS VISITED 
VIENNA ON MARCH 14.  THE TALKS WITH GOA OFFICIALS 
CENTERED ON ABBAS' PLEA FOR CONTINUATION OF EU ASSISTANCE 
TO THE PALESTINIANS. 
 
¶2.  (U) ABBAS UNDERLINED THE PALESTINIAN COMMITMENT TO 
INTERNATIONAL TREATIES, THE OSLO ACCORDS, THE ROADMAP, 
AND AGREEMENTS WITH ISRAEL. HE STRESSED THAT THE 
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED FOR HAVING 
CHOSEN THE PATH OF DEMOCRACY AND HAVING MADE ITS CHOICE 
IN FAVOR OF HAMAS. ABBAS NOTED THAT FATAH AND HAMAS WERE 
CURRENTLY CONDUCTING TALKS IN SEARCH OF A JOINT POLITICAL 
BASIS.  NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL SHOULD CONTINUE AFTER 
THE ISRAELI ELECTIONS IN ORDER TO FIND COMMON SOLUTIONS, 
HE SAID. 
 
¶3.  (U) CHANCELLOR SCHUESSEL SAID THE EU RESPECTED THE 
ELECTION RESULT, BUT UNDERSCORED THAT MUTUAL RECOGNITION 
OF ISRAEL AND PALESTINE, RENUNCIATION OF VIOLENCE BY BOTH 
SIDES, DISARMAMENT, AND OBSERVANCE OF INTERNATIONAL 
ACCORDS WAS INDISPENSABLE AS THE BASIS FOR FURTHER EU 
ASSISTANCE. SCHUESSEL STRESSED THE EU NEEDED GUARANTEES 
THAT FINANCIAL SUPPORT WOULD NOT GO TOWARD TERRORIST OR 
EXTREMIST PURPOSES.  OTHERWISE, THE EU WOULD SEEK OTHER 
PATHS TO HELP THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE.  SCHUESSEL 
EXPLICITLY PRAISED ABBAS AS "LEADER WITH FIRM PRINCIPLES, 
READY TO BUILD NEW BRIDGES AND TO CROSS EXISTING ONES." 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
4.(SBU)  SCHUESSEL'S REFERENCE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF 
LOOKING FOR "OTHER PATHS TO HELP THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE" 
PUT A RECENT EU PROPOSAL AT THE MARCH 10-11 FOREIGN 
MINISTERS' MEETING IN SALZBURG IN PERSPECTIVE.  CFSP HIGH 
REPRESENTATIVE JAVIER SOLANA AND EU COMMISSIONER BENITA 
FERRERO-WALDNER HAD LAUNCHED A WORKING PAPER THREATENING 
TO CUT 50 PERCENT OF ASSISTANCE TO THE PALESTINIANS IF 
HAMAS DID NOT RENOUNCE VIOLENCE AND RECOGNIZE ISRAEL.
