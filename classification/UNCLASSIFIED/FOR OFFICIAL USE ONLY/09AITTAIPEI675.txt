¶I.  BROAD ITEMS OF INTEREST TO ADVISORS AND AGENCY MANAGERS: 
 
(U) The Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) of the Taiwan Ministry 
of Economic Affairs announced that it will review its China 
investment policy, including the ban on Taiwan chipmakers from 
building 12-inch wafer fabrication plants in China while complying 
with Wassenaar Arrangement controls.  The IDB plans to hold a 
meeting on the issue in July.  If the meeting is open to the public, 
AIT plans to attend.  A press report on the above announcement has 
been forwarded to ISN/CATR, ECC and DOC/BIS.  See reftels for 
additional background. 
II. COMPLETED ACTIONS FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD 
¶A.  MEETINGS DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD: 
(U) During the week of June 1, the Advisor attended the Advisors 
Conference in Tbilisi, Georgia. 
 
¶B. BLUE LANTERN: 
 
(U) On May 20, the Advisor conducted a site check pursuant to a Blue 
Lantern request.  Results of the visit have been forwarded to 
PM/DDTC. 
 
III. TRAINING CONDUCTED DURING REPORTING PERIOD: 
 
(U) AIT held two internal control program (ICP) deployment workshops 
on May 14 - 15 and May 18 - 19 in Kaohsiung and Taichung, 
respectively.  Approximately 40 Taiwan company representatives were 
trained on how to develop a company-specific ICP and use 
classification and restricted party screening tools.  Some companies 
stated that their management would not likely spend the resources 
necessary to develop a full compliance tool which would include all 
the elements in the ICP.  However, all companies were enthusiastic 
about the screening applications and stated that they would begin to 
use them immediately. 
 
IV. UPCOMING TRAINING: 
 
¶1. (U) An ICP administrator training program and the last in a 
four-part series of ICP deployment workshops will take place during 
the second half of July in Taipei. 
 
¶2. (U) A Commodity Identification Training program, implemented by 
the Department of Energy, is scheduled for August 12-14 in Taipei.
